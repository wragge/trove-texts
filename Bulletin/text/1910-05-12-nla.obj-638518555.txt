Bjornson
Bjfirnstjerne Bjornson was born on the Bth
December, 1832, about four years later than
Ibsen, and he died four years after Ibsen had
departed. These two men were closely
associated in life, and were responsible for
the brilliant first appearance of Norway in
the republic of letters. About 30 years ago
Edmund Gosse explained their merits to the
English in his Studies in the Literature of
Northern Europe , and not long afterwards
E. A. Petherick, then a publisher, issued a
series of translations of foreign novels,
which began with Bjornson’s In God’s
Way. There had been translations of
Bjornson’s tales before this. In 1858
Mary Howitt published Trust and Trial, an
indifferent rendering of Synnove Solbalcken,
and, later on, translations by other hands of
other tales appeared, but none of them made
any mark. Most readers, in Australia at
any rate, made their first acquaintance with
these and other foreign novelists in the
cheap editions which began with Petherick’s
International Library. Nearly all Bjornson’s
work has now been translated into English,
and is published by Heinemann.
The earliest tale in order of production—
Synnove Solbalcken —is in many respects the
best. The style ,is exceedingly simple and
the characters natural, every day folk. Arne
and The Fisher Lassie have the same charm
—the quality of atmosphere, the freshness
and beauty of open-air life and simple emo-
tions. They give .an idea of bracing,
vigorous Norway and the idyllic life of the
peasantry. There isn’t much in them, but
what there is is sweet, and Bjornson’s art
appears in obliterating all signs of artifice.
Bjornstjerne was born and brought up in
a bleak mountain region, where his father
was pastor. The people were rough and un-
cultivated, but the parson was a muscular
Christian. He would stand no nonsense, and
converted as many by his fists as by his
preaching. While Bjornstjerne was still a
boy the family moved to Komsdale, as beau-
tiful as the previous district was barren.
The boy did not take kindly to schooling ;
but at school he founded a paper called
Liberty, and at an early age he was known
as “The Agitator.” After a hard struggle
he managed to, get into the University of
Christiana, where he neglected his studies,
made the acquaintance of Ibsen and wrote a
drama.
*
The tremendous energy of the man, and
his passionate patriotism, threw him into
politics as a root and branch reformer. He
was a whole-souled democrat, and the older
he grew the further he was carried from the
Christianity of his boyhood. Mill and
Darwin influenced him greatly, and, un-
fortunately, spoiled his work as a novelist.
In God’s Way and The Heritage of
the Kurts, which attracted much atten-
tion at the time sociological problems
were entering into fiction, are power-
ful studies, taking extreme instances as texts
for moral lessons. In God's Way is the better
of the two, and is intended to show that,
like Tess of the D’Urbervilles, a woman may
commit sin and yet be pure, and that one
need not be an orthodox believer to walk in
God’s way. The obvious preachment inter-
feres with the story, and neither of these
has the charm of his earlier pictures
of peasant life.
Bjornson was a vigorous champion of the
rights of women and a keen student of hyp-
notic and psychic phenomena. His most
successful drama, Beyond Human Power,
utilises spiritualistic business very effect-
ively. In 1903 he was awarded the Nobel
literature prize, worth about £BOOO. He
was always a fighter and propagandist, more
of a man of action than Ibsen, who was an
observer and analyst.
The life of Bjornson is bound up with that
of Ibsen. They were comrades, encouraging
each other at the beginning of their literary
lives; and in 1860 Ibsen, in dejection and
poverty, wrote to Bjornson as “ my one and
only friend.” But after the success of
Brand and Ibsen’s removal to Rome, he
became dissatisfied with Bjornson. He
thought his friend did not rate Peer Gynt at
its true value. Besides, Bjornson had
written in a scornful tone about decorations
from the King, and was supporting the
Parliamentary Socialist leader in his opposi-
tion to pensions to poets. Ibsen believed in
pensions, and told Bjornson that he would
take any honors or decorations that came
along.
In The Pretenders, Ibsen had pictured the
youthful and brilliant Bjornson as Hakon.
Gosse in his monograph on Ibsen says :
It was Bjornson’s "belt of strength,” as it was
Hakon’s, that he had utter belief in himself; and
with this his rival could not girdle himself.
Later on, he caricatured Bjornson in The
League of Youth , and for twenty-five years
the two champions were at enmity. The
reconciliation began with Bjornson, who
never refused his admiration of Ibsen s
genius, and championed Ghosts when no one
else had a good word to say for it. • They
shared a public tribute when the National
Norwegian Theatre was opened in Christiana
in 1899, and Ibsen’s son married Bjornson’s
daughter.
George Brandes has written of their re-
spective qualities in Ibsen and Bjornson
(Heinemann, 1899), and Gosse’s Ibsen may
be cited for a recent and just appreciation
of both writers :
Great $s the genius of Ibsen was, yet rating it
as ungrudgingly as'possible, we have to admit
that Bjornson’s character was the more magnetic
and more radiant of the two. . . . Bjornson,
with less originality, was the typical patriot in
literature, and what he said and thought and
wrote was calculated to stir the local conscience
to the depths of its being.
The Kipperling
The rough and ready criticism suggested
by labelling a man as the local edition of a
better known man elsewhere has its uses ;
but it has been overdone. It is generally
unjust to both, as it implies a measure of
equality, as in the parallels of Plutarch. In
politics, the implications are often dangerous,
as when John Morley was called the St. Just
of the English revolution. “It would have
been as well,” said John, “to call me the
Nero, the Torquemada, the lagO, the Blue-
beard, as the monster St. Just.” Lloyd
.George has recently had a good many nick-
names hurled at him, amongst them “the
Robespierre of Britain.” It would have been
nearer the mark to have called him the
W. M. Hughes of Britain.
In literature equality is seldom a condition
precedent to the labelling. Maeterlinck
may be the “Belgian Shakespeare” in a
remote and special sense, as Klopstock was
“the German Milton” (“very German”—
commented Coleridge). J. Whitcomb Riley
has been called “the American Burns” ;
and a New Yorker remarked on first reading
Swinburne’s Poems and Ballads —“ Say, this
chap must be the Ella Wheeler Wilcoxof Eng-
land.” Douglas Sladen, in the introduction
to A Century of Australian Sony, did the
business generously, and baptised our bards
with the names of Lucretius, Shelley, Burns,
Adelaide Procter, etc. It is a common
habit, and Lawson hit it neatly in his
“Australian Bards and Bush Reviewers.”
But what a time Sladen would have had if
he had arrived after Kipling ! The number
of those who might, on Sladen’s principle,
be called “the Australian Kipling” wofild
make him perspire, or put it to the ex-
haustive ballot. -
Australia has no monopoly of Kipperlings.
Wherever the English language is written
there are sure to be some “under
the influence” of the potent spirit.
There are several English. Kipperlings,
and last year one sprang up in West
Africa—J. Stuart-Young, author of The
Seductive Coast, which is Kip with a dash of
Byron and gingerbeer. The most prominent
of the flock at the present moment is Robert
W. Service, whose Songs of a Sourdough is
already in its 21st edition, and whose pub-/
lishers proclaim him as “ the Canadian
Kipling.” He certainly has all the ear-
marks, which are as easily identified as those
of Swinburne.
The Anglo-Indian saw a good deal of life
in the raw, and had the ability to borrow
and use appropriate verse-moulds for repre-
senting it. A later and lesser man, con-
fronted with similar aspects of life, can
hardly help borrowing the same moulds, and
with them, the brand of the master. Robert
Service does not measure up anywhere near to
Kipling, nor does he write of Canada at large
so much as the-Yukon. It is as reasonable to
call him the Canadian Kipling as it is to
nickname Kip, “the ’Orner of the Music
’Alls ” or the “ Shikespear of the Harmy.”
For Australian purposes, Service is the
Henry Lawson or kb_ Bar o Paterson of the
Yukon. In subject matter and grim humor
he resembles Lawson ; but he is much more
florid and boisterous in language. In two
points, at least, he is like Patqrson—his first
book has had a tremendous circulation, and
is better than his second.
\f>
The second volume of Service is called
Ballads of a Cheechaho. What exactly a
Cheechako is, does not appear. The article is
mentioned only once in the verses, and there
it is “supercilious”; so most likely it is a
broken-down Englishman. In the titles
alone, the ballads remind you of Australian
verse—“ Men of the High North,” instead
of “ Men of Out-Back”; “ The Man from
Eldorado ” for “ The Man from Ironbark ” ;
and “ Clancy of the Mounted Police ” is full
brother to our old friend of the Overflow.
There is also “The Prospector,” as in Dyson ;
and a “Black Sheep,” as in Ogilvie. This
passage, from “The Prospector,” might
have been written in Australia:
Beyond the shark-tooth ranges sawing savage at
the sky
There’s a lowering land no white man ever struck;
There’s gold, there’s gold in millions, and I’ll find
it if I die ;
And I’m going there once more to try my luck.
Maybe I’ll fail—what matter? It’s a mandate,
it’s a vow;
And when in lands of dreariness and dread
You seek the last lone frontier, far beyond your
frontiers now,
You will find the old prospector silent, dead.
But an Australian would not be likely to
make a “ Black Sheep ” say :
There goes an officer’s lady—gives me a haughty
stare —
Me that’s an earl’s own nephew— that is the
hardest to hear.
The most conspicuous feature of these
verses is their picturesque imagery. In the
endeavor to portray the emotions of civilised
man in the wild and lonely places, where
elemental passions have a free run, and the
forces of nature appear more stupendous and
weird than elsewhere, Service falls into the
error of the superficial artist, and makes his
color shriek. These lines from the soliloquy
of a woodcutter are an example of excess of
metaphor:
Impotent as a beetle pierced on the needle of
Fate,
A wretch in a cosmic death-cell, peaks for my
prison bars,
’Whelmed by a world stupendous, list-
less I wait,
Browned in a sea of silence, strewn with confetti
of stars.
And here it is in one line :
The days were bright and the morning light was
sweet with jewelled song.
Coleridge’s “At one stride came the dark ”
has suggested ‘*the winter fell with a sudden
swoop,” and a number of other phrases come
from familiar sources. The N orthern Lights
evoke a welter of imagery :
Amber and rose and violet, opal and gold it came,
It swept the sky like a giant scythe, it quivered
back to a wedge ;
Argently bright it cleft the night with a wavy
golden edge.
Pennants of silver waved and streamed, lazy
banners unfurled ;
Sudden splendors of sabres gleamed, lightning
javelins were hurled.
There in our awe we crouched and saw with our
wild uplifted eyes
Charge and retire the hosts of fire in the battle-
field of the skies.
Try to get all that on the retina of your
inward eye, and then add the heap to be.
found in other pages of the book. Of course,
these aye the Ballads of Blasphemous Bill,
and One-Eyed Mike and Hard Luck Henry ;
so the exaggeration may be regarded as in
character. Occasionally there are powerful
and effective phrases, such as :
. . . where the mountains hunch like the vertebrae
of the world.
The valley’s girth was dumb with mirth, the
laughter of the wild,
The still sardonic laughter of an ogre o’er a child.
And frowning down to bar our path a muddle of
mountains lay.
There was some poetry in Songs of the
Sourdough ; but these ballads will appeal
most to the people who like their yellow-
drama very yellow. Both volumes, however,
have an interest apart from the poetical, the
interest to men in cities of all that relates to
the bizarre, the unconventional and the wild.
Prehistoric Peeps
An interest somewhat similar to that just
mentioned must have awakened early in
Miss Dulcie Deamer (now Airs. Goldie).
A volume of her stories —In the Begin-
ning (Gordon and Gotcli)— contains one
novelette, “The Daughter of the Incas,”
which was commenced at the age of
13 ; and all of the stories were com-
pleted before her 18th year. It is easy to
understand how the barbaric splendor of
Prescott’s Conquest of Peru, or some romance
founded upon it, would impress the lively
imagination of a youngster ; but the rude
antics and brutal passions of primitive men
do not seem likely to attract a girl, even it
she had read Wells’ “Stories of the Stone
Age,” or any other prehistoric yarns.
The fact that sketches of a similar kind
have been written before does not detract
much from the merit of the first four items
in the book, which originally appeared in
The Lone Hand. These stories succeed in
realising prehistoric man in typical episodes,
from which might have evolved the institu-
tions of marriage, the family, the tribe and
kingship. In such ways, one imagines,
“ the half-man, half-brute ” ancestors of ours
must have acced. And this air of reality is
a triumph of style. Miss Deamer would
probably squeal at the sight of a mouse, like
most of her sex; but in setting forth the
primal savage in action, her short, tense
sentences were not weakened by feminine
mawkishness. Otto Weininger explained
that the virile noter is not a prerogative of
man any more than the feminine note is
confined to women writers. In the Begin-
ning illustrates his theory. It is a remark-
able book for so young a writer, and Miss
Deamef’s literary career should be an in-
teresting one. If she can write about more
popular subjects with the same ability, it
should be a very successful career.
Lance Fallaw, author of two volumes of
good verse, has lived in S. Africa, and now
writes from Queensland about colonial
verse ”
Referring to your review of Crouch’s S.
African Anthology (lied Page 31/3/TO), a
few remarks may be permitted from one who
had some connection therewith. Peing in
England at the time the first edition was
going through the press, I undertook the
correction of the proofs, though I may say I
had nothing whatever to do with the selection
of the verses. The Anthology is, to the best
of my belief, absolutely the first of the kind
that has been attempted in S. Africa, and it
suffers from excess of bulk. Its very success
from the view point of circulation is due to
some of its most obvious weaknesses. I
therefore rise to caution you against basing
your final opinion of S. African verse solely
on this all-too-generous volume. The other
day I fell in with a book called ‘ ‘ A Thousand
Gems of Australian Literature ” —a title
which, if true, would give Australia the
world’s record in speed for production of
“ gems.” I can assure you the vast majority
of the pieces could have entered hot favorites
for the Hundred Worst Poems to which the
Red Page recently referred. So it is ob-
viously unsafe to judge by anthologies alone.
A close study (not by anthologies) of Aus-
tralasian, Canadian and South African verse
impels me to the conviction that there is
not, as yet, the toss of a coin among the three
of them. They stand still practically on a
level, and the thing that will first give one
or other the lead will be the coming of the
first great colonial poet, wherever he may
occur. The fact that he has not occurred
yet never worries me the way it does some
people. It has merely happened so, that is
all, and no one can give a reason for it,
any more than for the fact, say, that
Parramatta has never produced a champion
club-swinger. There is no cause and effect
in these things. What is the use of talking
about “uncongenial atmosphere”? Could
any atmosphere be more “uncongenial”
than that which starved a man to death in
Grub-street, or gave Milton £5 for “ Para-
dise Lost”? No, the great colonial poet
will come just when and where ho will, and
all our shouting meanwhile will make just no
difference at all. I should say that the
two countries which have the best chance
of producing him, having regard to color,
incident, scenery, etc., are {South Africa find
Maoriland. But here again lam contradict-
ing myself. Whereas I say I trace no law of
(visible) cause and effect in these things,
still I do agree with you that Australia’s
“ calmer flow ” is a distinct disadvantage in
this respect, and will tend, so far as we can
see, to retard the development of high im-
aginative genius. ■ .
I submit that the difficulty of defining
colonial literature with any exactness does
not spring from • the youth of the
colonies at all, but from the community
of language, which will always make
such a definition difficult, if not impos-
sible. A great Englishman travels in France
(say), and writes poems there. The
poems may be descriptive of scenes and sub-
jects entirely French, but we know without
any arguing that they are part of English
literature. The language alone settles that.
But if a great Australian travels in England
and writes a poem—is it Australian litera-
ture or English ? You might argue the
point till Doomsday, and, really, what’s the
good of it? The Red Page said recently
that Australian literature was bounded by
Australian interest. I agree, if it means
that Australian interest is only bounded by
the world, which it ought to be. But I cer-
tainly dissent, if it means that Australian
interest cannot reach beyond Australian
subjects. No one has ever taught that an
English poet should never write a poem
without bringing in oak-trees and Devon-
shire farm-houses, and that sort of thing.
He writes about friendship, or any other
abstract and universalsubject whatever, if he
just feels that way.; arid I claim that an
Australian or Canadian poet is entitled to
just the same liberty. However, I’m wan-
dering from the subject—and the matter is
well laid down in Longfellow’s “Kavanagh.”
I think you are scarcely just to Pringle,
who has had testimonials to his merit beyond
any that have fallen to Harpur. You are
right when you say that there are “no
,(S. African) ballads to match Lawson’s or
Paterson’s.” If there were, there would be
none to read them. S. Africa is far past the
ballad stage. The reading world there is
small, but intensely modern. Australia is
far more like England in social life and
development than S. Africa is, yet S. Africa’s
literary ideals—such as they are—are far
closer to the English model, and she is far less
anxious to break new ground, than Australia
is. Which is a paradox, leading us—
whither ?

KEEP YOUR HEALTH.
THIS MEDICINE LENGTHENS LIFE.
A WOMAN’S LIFE-STORY.
Women who suffer from the pangs of indigestion or dyspepsia should carefully read this
document, as it is true in every particular, and tells them how they can he also cured
Clements Tonic, Ltd.
“L think it my duty to inform you that for seven
weeks in December, 1909, and a part of January, 1910, I
was so ill that I could not take anything but biscuits and
milk-food, my appetite and digestion were so bad. I tried
several bottles of medicine from local chemists, and also
tried several standard remedies uselessly.
“ My husband, who is employed on one of the A.U.S.N.
steamers, running to the South Sea islands, was advised
by one of the ship’s officers to induce me to try Clements
Tonic. Acting on the advice given, I did so, and lam glad
to say that I am so thoroughly cured that I can eat any-
thing and am in splendid health. The first bottle did me
good, but the second and third (I only had need to take
three) gave me such splendid health that all the neighbors
marvelled to see me walking about a healthy woman again.
I cannot praise it too highly ; in my opinion it is a wonder-
ful medicine. I did not think it was such a good tonic,
but I am satisfied by my health to-day it is worth its
weight in gold to women who suffer from indigestion and
nervous prostration as I did.
Witness: W. Buown, J.P., Balmain. ( Signed) “AGNES MORLOCK.
Mrs. Morlock lives at No. 4 Ann Street, Balmain, where she is a living testimony to
this great medicine. It is unequalled for the relief of stomach and liver troubles, and its
timelv use will prevent many slight functional ailments from developing into serious
organic diseases. All chemists and stores sell Clements Tonic; send for it to-day.

Sunrise.
From flower and leaf the dew fell thick
And soddened beach and lawn,
And wand’ring down the coast, there cried
A wind before the dawn.
The headlands slowly gathered shape—■
Pale-faced they gazed afar ;
Like one that looks a last farewell,
It waned—the morning star.
Then royally the Conqueror,
With purple glories crowned.
Arose, and with a careless hand
Spread lavish gold around.
The earth, new-warmed to life, grew glad ;
Bees hummed—a festal throng;
The glowing sea beheld its lord
And greeted him with song.

RODERIO QUINN.
“Arise! Awake!”
Ten thousand bards throughout the earth
Have yelled “ Arise ! Awake ! ”
When Blather springs once more to birth,
That form ’tis sure to take.
And Fatmen all, of monstrous girth,
Are wont to shake with hearty mirth
When Folly’s voice, of little worth,
Exclaims “Arise ! Awake !’’
Full well Creation’s Fatmen know
How soon the noise will sink ;
How fast the blare and froth will flow
O’er Time’s forgetful brink.
Yea, Fat shall only quake with woe
When some Strong Man walks to and fro
And whispers gently, “ Do not so—
Sit down, you fools, and think ! ”
“ Arise ! Awake ! ” That foolish cry
Leaves things just as they were ;
Vain Noise uplifts no Cause on high,
But leads unto despair.
When Blather leads the workers by
The Fatman winks the other eye,
And says, “ Dear me, they must be dry—
These blowers of hot air ! ”
Calm thought, not hefty yells and screams,
Makes Fat lament and shrink ;
He laughs at dreamers and their dreams,
And all their frantic ink.
But when the torch of Reason gleams,
Then Fat grows pale and moans, “It seems
As if these folk saw through my schemes—
They have Begun to Think ! ”
“ Arise ! Awake ! ” It profiteth
But little if men rise
Armed only with a shibboleth,
And madness in their eyes.
The placid Fatman blandly smith :
“ What is the harm of wind and breath.
If no man answer uttereth
Unto their Hows and Whys?”

Saturday.
’Tis one o’clock. The foaming flight
Of homeward ferries from the Quay
Skims round the wharves to left and right,
Over the lonely, clean-swept sea.
A lurching lighter by its tug
Is being hustled quickly west;
With creaking hawsers does it hug
Its escort to its ample chest.
The panting tug-boat with its prey
Looks like a sergeant, much too small,
Who drags a maudlin dame away
And doesn’t like the job at all.
Laboriously do they pass
Along the pathway broad and clean,
Like a wide stretch of tender grass
That rolls deserted wharves between.
The clatt’ring winches ’neath the folds
Of their tarpaulins lie asleep,
Like loud-voiced gossips of the holds,
Who’ve told the secrets of the deep.
Tucked into green, suburban bays
The idle ships at moorings ride,
Taking no heed of Saturdays
Save but to swing with wind and tide.
There is no movement on the sea
Only the silent ferries pace
Like ushers reverentially
About an empty meeting-place.
Slowly the hour of stillness wanes ;
But two o’clock its beauty brings,
For then these widespread water-plains
Are sprinkled o’er with snowy wings.
At three the white-sea butterflies
Are whirling in a joyous game ;
And loaded ferry-boats—all eyes
Follow like beetles stout and lame.
At sundown towards their hidden nooks
The white moths flit in insect haste ;
While yet the lone wayfarer looks
They’ve melted from the cold, grey waste.
And then ’tis night, and ’tvvixt dark ships
That toil and travel o’er the sea.
The smoking ushers, for small tips.
Take people to and from the Quay.

•methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-

invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bullutin,” is the proper
superscription for “copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THE DEAD KING.
No higher praise can be given to any king than
that, while he lived, nobody wanted to abolish
kings; and so much as that can be said, almost
without qualification, concerning him whose most
untimely death has thrown an empire into mourn-
ing. In England 40 years ago there was a strong
Republican party. For 30 of the intervening
years Queen Victoria was on the throne ; and as
she grew older and nursed a widow’s sorrows, and
as the people dwelt*more and more upon her
personal virtues, there was less and less disposi-
tion to disturb her. She was a woman ; and man
shrinks instinctively from even an indirect attack
upon a woman, especially if she be one who
wears the badges of years and widowhood.
So the Republican adopted the attitude of his
natural opponent, and said in effect : “The time
is not ripe. Let us wait till we have a man to
deal with.” But the Queen lived on—lived on
till 85 years had come and gone. She outlasted
most of the old iconoclasts ; and those whom she
did not outlive felt no longer equal to a strenuous
campaign. Nor was there any ready-made army
of Republicans to take their place; for in the
years of chivalrous truce none had been enlisted.
* * * *
When the Queen died there was, therefore, no
militant Republican party awaiting the new King
upon the steps of the throne. The immediate
future was thus in the hands of Edward himself;
with him it rested whether the Republicans in
Great and Greater Britain should be revived as
an active, combative force. By any interference
with the liberties of the people at home, by any
mischievous intriguing abroad, by any unworthy
example as a social leader, the smouldering torch
which had blazed 30 years before would have been
fanned into a consuming flame. Many a man
devoted to ancient institutions must have had
grave doubts about the future; for a complete
change in the methods of “the Crown” was
inevitable. Through long years the Queen had
reposed almost unreservedly upon the judgment
of her Ministers. Foreign potentates and powers
may have cherished her in their affections ; but
she could scarcely have had much influence upon
them. Nor during the years of her widowhood
had she ventured upon more than a passive atti-
tude in relation to domestic policy. She had thus
confirmed Great Britain in its monarchical insti-
tution by the simple process of stripping her
sovereignty of nearly all of its sovereign powers.
It was hardly possible for Edward to follow the
same path. We are a practical people, and even
of the sovereign we ask ourselves and one another,
“ What good does he do?” The old Queen might
interest herself in her family ; and one who sees a
venerable lady, be she queen or cottager, sur-
rounded by children and grandchildren, asks no
more of her. But a king, comparatively young—
he must justify himself. For nine years Edward
was put to that test. Never for a day was there
any perceptible shrinking from it. A utilitarian
age challenged him; he accepted the challenge,
and there is no question about the result. He
found the torch of Republicanism laid aside outof
a chivalrous regard for the old Queen ; he leaves
it almost quenched. Reason knows the heredi-
tary principle to be just iis ridiculous as ever it
was; but while Reason mocks at the making of
kings by the accident of birth, Commonsense
asks it to stay its hand until someone shall show
a better way of choosing that nominal head which
every State must have. In theory there are many
ways, no doubt; but given a monarch of the
qualities of Edward, the ridiculous principle
works out so well in practice that not only is it
not worth while struggling to make a change when
many more urgent needs face us, but it is even
doubtful whether in such circumstances the change
would be worth while oven if it could be had with
no more effort than the stroke of a pen.
* * * *
Yet if the seventh Edward has given more
strength to the foundations of the Throne than
any other British sovereign of two centuries past,
he has done it by tearing up by the roots a great
deal of the old rotten foundations upon which the
Throne had rested insecurely. Those veryqualities
which made many a good man tremble for the
future were indeed the base-course upon which he
built the enduring fabric of his success. He was
greater than every other monarch of his line
because he was so human. The curtain will be
mostly drawn down now upon his frolicsome youth
and his robustious middle-age. But there is no need
to draw it down. He was a man, and he never
pretended to be anything else. It was as a»man
and not as a demi-god that he came to the throne ;
and it was as a man and not as a demi-god that he
sat in it. He made his name great by his diplo-
macy ; and the diplomat must be a man, and a
very human man. If he believed in “the
divine right of kings” he never mentioned
it. He certainly never rested upon it. He
was much too wise to seek to build the throne
upon the sycophantic adoration of “ the Person.”
He sought to re-establish it upon what, in these
later days, at any rate, is the only rock upon
which Throne or anything else can be safely built
—the rock of practical utility. He offered us the
Crown as a paying investment; and he strove to
make it pay, and strove so well that, in a year
when the nation is seriously thinking of striking
off the coronet, the Crown is—at the opening of
his reign, at any rate —fixed more firmly on the
head of his son, the untried George, than it
has been upon the head of any other member of
his line. It is better to have done something than
to have been something; better to have won
through by certain deed than doubtful right; and
now that he is. dead, at a moment when Britain
can very ill spare his wonderful capacity for recon-
ciling conflicting elements and salving the wounds
of those who have to accept defeat, his memory
claims an Empire’s respect on the best of all
grounds, the ground of human achievement.
THE N.S.W. LABOR PARTY’S GREAT
CHANCE.
The N.S.W. Labor party is faced witn the chance
of its political lifetime. There are so many things
which the State wants done and which even C. G.
Wade can’t, in common decency, suddenly pro-
claim that he meant to do all the time he was
denouncing them as Socialistic insanities. In
regard to the railway-congestion scandal, the Oppo-
sition leader is offered a choice between declaring
with Wade for “ Sydney interests ” and declaring
for the interests of the State at large. A Liberal
put the position in the Telegraph on May 5 :
We are told that a start has been made to duplicate
the main lines. At the rate of progress this is being
done, it will take 20 years to complete. Then, what is
the man on the land to do in the meantime?
Don’t you think the producer is entitled to a little more
speed, and a great deal more consideration than this?
Even if all our trunk lines were duplicated, would that
end the matter? It may give a quicker transit for a
time, but for how long? When it is well known that even
under present shortage of trucks and slow transit, there
are not sufficient facilities at Darling Harbor to cope with
the traffic, what would it be with a faster transit? The
congestion would be ever so much greater. The whole
secret is too much centralisation. ... It is no use offering
a stale bait to the electors ; it is so old now that it has
fallen to pieces. Let the man on the land see that the
Government is in earnest by acts, not by promises.
Then it may expect to get a further tenure of office.
These pretty pictures that are drawn to deputations are
getting too old. The only picture the producer would
like to see is thousands of navvies on duplicating works,
cross sections of railways, opening up all available sea-
ports, etc. Then, and not tijl then, will the man on the
land believe he is at last being thought of.
But it is Wade’s misfortune that in the matter
of railway reform he has gone as far as the
Sydney vested interests, which own his party,
will allow. He is prepared to make provision for
more up-country trade to be shot through the
offices of Sydney merchants and middlemen ; hut
for him to talk of giving the outports a chance,
and, incidentally, relieving the chronic block in
and around Sydney, would he tantamount to pro-
nouncing his death sentence in those quarters
where his ultimate hope lies. Already Sydney
.Evening News has warningly voiced the senti-
ments of the crowd that dominate Wade when,
in touching on what ic called “the sudden en-
thusiasm about decentralisation,’’ it said: “The
.public will want to know whether it does not in-
volve either a complete or partial paralysis of the
scheme to develop adequately the terminal railway
facilities at Sydney.” The section which directs
Wade is little concerned about any scheme to de-
velop adequately the railway facilities of the back
country; but it goes simply fanti on any pro-
posal to crowd a little more wool, hides
and stock into the glutted marts of the
metropolis. It has been the slanderous fashion
of Toryism in the past to represent Labor
as the enemy of the -farmer. McGowen is now
offered the opportunity to still that mendacious
clamor. It is up to him to turn down with scorn
Wade’s futile propositions to deal with the
!N.S.W. railway chaos by adding a siding
here and an extra half-dozen m:les of
rails there, and come out definitely with
a railway policy calculated to do things.
Such a policy would have as its hist plank the
development, by means of trunk lines, of Fort
Stephens and Port Macquarie on the north, and
Twofold Bay and Jervis Bay on the south.
Thereby every agriculturist whose grain is now
decaying at back blocks railway stations, and
every stock-owner whose sheep and beasts are
liable to starve outside Homebush, would benefit;
and they know it. It is a safe ticket. Recent
events indicate that, nowadays, when purely
Sydney interests bump against the interests of the
country at large, the purely Sydney interests go
down.
A Labor plank with which the State is in warm
sympathy, and one which even the Wade party
hasn’t, at this stage, the audacity to filch, is
the nationalisation of some of the State’s coal-
mines. Wade fought the battle of the Newcastle
coal vend three months ago and scored a win.
And the State paid—paid extravagantly in in-
creased freights and fares, in a starved railway
service, in boom prices for fuel, and in a myriad
other inconveniences. All the satisfaction the
public got was the knowledge that its hard-earned
cash was torn from it to buttress the principle of
Private Enterprise in one of its worst manifesta-
tions. Recalling the way the principle is super-
seded in the cases of telegraphs, trams, railways,
etc., the country began to feel, at an early
stage of the contest, that the struggle
was hardly worth it at the price. And
later on, as the disgraceful shindy continued,
the public noted the arrogantly uncompromising
attitude of the coal-owners, and thought so harder
than ever. To-day it is safe to say that 90 per
cent, of the people are prepared to let Private
Enterprise fry itself before they permit a con-
sideration of its interests to stand in front of the
general good again. From a railway business
viewpoint, the argument is all on the side of
State-owned collieries. Nationalised coal mines
are the inevitable corollaries to nationalised
train and tramway services; there is not one in-
telligently-run railway company abroad which
hasn’t its own coal mine. Even if the coal-
owners of N.S.W. weren’t for the most part
fractious individuals who simply ask for trouble
in the industry which they control, the argument
for some State ownership is, therefore, powerful.
Under existing circumstances, it is overwhelming
and urgent, and it is for State Laborites to score
by the fact.
* * * *
Apart from a graduated land-tax, which may
for the present be left to the Commonwealth
Government, those are the reforms for which the
people are most ! eager, and which no party but
the Labor party can offer without stultifying
itself. There are others, however, which com-
mend themselves to the good sense of the electors.
Thus Labor’s proposal to abolish the useless
and expensive Legislative Council and the
equally useless and expensive institution of
State Governor appeals not to workers
merely, but to business folk who can appre-
ciate that a State which owes upwards of 90
million sterling—represented at best by assets that
in a decade may be scrap-iron—can’t afford those
archaic luxuries even if the State’s collective sense
of humor permits it to tolerate them. And,
finally, the Labor party is offered the golden
opportunity of showing itself the first State party
in the history of Federation which was also a
militant National party. Wade has already
started whining that the 255. arrangement which
he battled for at the last Premiers’ conference,
and which he stumped the country to bring
to pass last month, is inadequate. The indi-
cations are that he proposes to exploit Fisher’s
present readiness to abide by the financial
agreement as a new assault on the liberties of
the allegedly trampled-on State. McGowen and
his followers, by ranging themselves against the
anti-Australians on such questions as these, will
enthuse the Nationalists of N.S.W., whom for-
merly they have left lukewarm. There is really
only one • thing which is going to kill the State
Labor party’s chances in the coming fray, and
that is a reversion to its fatal old habit of crawling
in the wake of Wade and the anti-Labor papers,
as it did in the wire-netting steal crisis, or the
Federal capital crisis, or the strike crisis. But
the perils in this direction are now slight. Wade
and his newspaper sheets have slumped the
great slump; and the temptation to crawl in their
wake, politically, is not the temptation it was.
THE INSURANCE BUSINESS IN
AUSTRALIA.
A suspicion begins to prevail that competition is
not always the thing it was once cracked up to be.
The old, carefully-nurtured idea was that, as long
as an unlimited number of people were allowed to
cut in at a trade or business, the public might be
quite sure that prices would be all right. Gradu-
ally, however, the public began to realise that,
though competition might keep down profits, it by
no means kept down prices; by degrees the truth
was realised that, if six people are doing what
one could do quite comfortably, five unnecessary
people are being maintained, and their mainte-
nance must come out of the public’s pocket.
Further, when the business is spread over six
stores or factories, or works or offices, not one of
them is usually in a position to get in the best
appliances, or lay out the necessary capital to
produce the best results.
* * * *
There are few big businesses in which there is
more waste than life insurance ; certainly there
are very few in which the waste affects more
people. And, worse still, the curse -of waste
comes home to roost at a time, usually, when
people can least afford to be affected for the
worse. Not that they always know when they
are being hit. The average citizen knows when
he is paying too much for most of the things he
eats and wears. He knows how many vegetables
he ought to get for 9d., and what sort of a coat
15s. should buy. But, in a general way, he has no
idea how much insurance he should get for his
money. That business is something which the
public doesn’t pretend to understand. If a man
who is thinking about insurance goes to the
trouble of comparing the premiums he would
have to pay in two or three offices which he has
in his mind’s eye, the canvasser for the office
which doesn’t come well out of the comparison is
prepared with a dozen arguments to show that
the test is really valueless: his own office, for
instance, pays bigger bonuses than the others, or
it is bound to do so in the future, or the
other offices have a lot of rotten securities
and probably won’t be able to pay even
the face value of the policies, or the other
usually “load ” their cases (that is, charge
an extra premium because the proponent’s grand-
father was suspected of heart disease), or they
charge “nearest birthday” instead of “next
birthday.” There never yet was a man who had
made up his mind to insure in any one office but
could have found the representative of some other
office prepared to give him, at any rate, plausible
reasons why he should change his mind and go
across the road. And there is nobody who can
say the last word on the subject—nobody who can
say positively that one is wrong and the
other right, that one office is best and
some other is next-best, and so on. For
when a person buys insurance he buys
something that is not like anything else, lie
pays to-day for something to be delivered, it may
be to-morrow, it may be 10 years, it may be 50
years hence. Clearly, strange and wonderful
things may happen in 50 years or even in 10.
Nobody knows what the future will be; nobody
therefore can tell what the results will be. Con-
sequently, there is no positive rule or pot or other
measuring appliance for classifying offices into
best or second-best or third-rate. The Insurance
Commission, which has just been pondering these
things, declines even to recommend that a stand-
ard of solvency should be set up. The public, it
says in effect, must be allowed to take its chances.
All the Commission thinks nossibi- 1 is to reserve
the right to stop a demonsi. ably-msolvent office
from continuing in business.
* * * *
Recognising that the matter of life insurance
was one that was littered over with doubt and
uncertainty, something like a habit was formed of
saying, “ Well, so long as it is a mutual office it is
all right.” That habit has costa lot of people a
lot of money. The idea that a mutual office
must be all right was based on the enticing fact
that all the profits belong to the policy-holders; and
that was a very admirable tiling to start with.
The weak point which was mostly overlooked was
that this arrangement offered no sort of guarantee
whatever that the profits which the mutual office
would make would be of any size or consequence.
Profits in life insurance spring from three sources.
When it is drawing up its tables of premiums
an insurance office has to consider three things—
(l) How long, on the average, floes an ordinary
healthy man live past a given age ; (2) how much
will the man have to pay in so that the payments,
plus interest on the payments, will amount to
£IOO by the end of the period which the man may
be expected to live; (3) how much will it cost to
collect the premiums and otherwise keep the con-
cern running ? If by using great skill or care in
selecting its members they live longer than the
average, the office makes large profits : it not only
collects from the members more premiums than
it had calculated upon, but it also lias the
use of the premiums already collected for a
longer period, and that means more interest
earnings in the aggregate. That is one source
of profit, and it depends almost entirely upon the
quality of the management. Then if it reckons
beforehand that it will spend 15 per cent, of the
premiums on expenses, and actually only spefnls
10 per cent., there is a further profit available for
distribution. Finally, if it has reckoned upon
earning 2J per cent, interest, and actually earns
44 per cent., there is similar profit from a third
source. But these profits depend upon the quality
of the management too ; and the mere fact that
an office is mutual does not guarantee that the
management will be good. Thus, while there is
one Australian mutual office which has an
expense rate of 14'05 per cent, of the pre-
mium receipts, there is another mutual office
with an expense rate of 33’42 per cent. And
while there is one which earns £5 ss. (id. percent,
per annum in interest on its funds, there is
another which earns only £4 Is. Id. per cent. It
is certainly not enough, then, that an insurance
office should be mutual; for the management of a
mutual office may be deplorably bad.
* * *■
Moreover, even if one knows that the manage-
ment is personally very good, the results may still
be very bad. If there are threetimesas many offices
as there need be, and three canvassers are
wearing out three pairs of boots in pursu-
ing the business that one could very comfort-
ably manage, obviously somebody has to pay for
the unnecessary destruction of two pairs. More-
over, even a life insurance canvasser cannot live
on boots alone; he must have something to eat.
Now, if three shops open to supply the vegetables
that one shop could very well supply, it is possible
that the unnecessary two will, fora time, pay some
of the rent and part of the bills for the horse-feed
out of a small private hoard of capital. It doesn’t
necessarily all come out of the customer’s pockets
in an excessive price for the innocent pumpkin,
etc. But in life assurance there very rarely is
any private hoard. Whatever capital there is in
a mutual office is the policy-holders’ capital.
If there is waste in connection with life insur-
ance, in a mutual office in particular, the whole of
it has to be suffered by the policy-holder. The
effect in a proprietary or co-operative office is not
very different, either. In that case, the policy-
holder may be guaranteed against excessive waste
—the office may guarantee that the expenses
shall not exceed a certain figure. But if the
expense is kept below that maximum, any waste
outside that limit is borne mainly by the policy-
holders. That is to say, whatever kind of office
it may lie, either the whole or by far the greater
part of whatever is saved from the waste belongs
to the policy-holders; and either the whole or by
far the greater part of what is wasted comes out
of the policy-holders’ pockets.
For the foregoing reason, when two years ago
the amalgamation of two substantial life insur-
ance offices was announced, Thk Bcllktix wel-
comed the move as a right one; it welcomed a
smaller amalgamation a few months ago ; it wel-
comed another large amalgamation recently ; and
it hopes to welcome some more yet. What the
process means in saving waste, and what the
saving of waste means to the policy-holders, can
be judged from the report made lately by the old
.actuary of one of the affected offices
As further evidence of the remarkable benefits enjoyed
by the policies consequent on amaleainatiori, it maybe
noted that the surplus for the year 1009 is over 100 per
cent, greater than that earned in any year prior to the
amalgamation.
One trouble, no doubt, lies with displaced em-
ployees. But, especially in such a matter as life
insurance, Australia cannot afford to pay men to
go on doing totally unnecessary things. We
might employ every workman in the country at
the job of shifting sand from one side of the road
to the other ; but the country wouldn’t be any
Ifor’arder, and the last state of those men would
be worse than the first. So with the insurance
drummer and all the other insurance employees
who are merely shifting sand from one side of the
road to the other. There is no need to treat
them harshly, though ; the savings from amalga-
mation are so large that it would pay the
amalgamated offices to treat the displaced men
handsomely.
* * * *
But, while these amalgamations will reduce
waste, and thus give the insurer more insurance
for his money, something still remains to be
done ; and it is a thousand pities that the Insur-
ance Commissioners neglected to recommend it—
though the oversight can fortunately be repaired
by Parliament when it comes to deal with the
whole insurance matter. In Great Britain
there are two or three offices which re-


duce waste to the minimum by the pro-
cess of cutting out the canvasser and the
premium-collector. Australia has every sort of
office but that one ; and it ought to have that one
established by the Commonwealth Government,
and put under the control of the Government
Statistician or an Insurance Commissioner. The
office would call for no capital—the policy-
holders would provide their own ; the extreme
outlay would be a few hundred pounds in
preliminaries. If other offices chose to come
in they might. They should at least be
encouraged to do so. And these operations
would cost the Government nothing either; it
would simply administer the funds and carry on
the business for the policy-holders. To this office
many a man who wanted insurance would go,
certain that there he would get full value for his
money. The premium he would pay would be
for insurance, with a trifle added for expenses.
The premium that a man pays to some of the
existing offices is for expenses, with a trifle added
for insurance. There was a time when practically
nobody insured unless he was dragooned into it.
Now, however, most business men, and a host
who do not regard themselves as business men,
go into life insurance as they do into any other
investment. Why should these men pay for the
vast amount of tongue and shoe-leather consumed
in capturing and driving in the unwilling? The
actual cost of management should not be more
than 7 per cent, of the premiums. The British
offices which work on this plan do it in some cases
for less. Why should the investor pay another 7
per cent. —or in some offices as much as another
20 per cent. ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Firstfruits of Kitchener.
In his policy speech at Winton, last week. Pre-
mier Joseph Ward, of Maoriland, announced
that the Government intended to adopt practi-
cally the whole of Kitchener’s defence recom-
mendations. Ward is, and alwkys has been, a
believer in adequate defence for the safety of the
Australasian outposts, although his shots
to hit that target have been at times doubt-
tully aimed, the Dreadnought fiasco being
a case in point. Nevertheless, when Kit-
chener set before lmn a scheme which was
almost a counterpart of the one prepared for
the Commonwealth, WARDaocepted the authority
as final, and had the details worked up as far as
possible and the cost approximately arrived at.
“ We have got to pay to save our skins,” he said
in effect, ‘‘and we are going to do it.” Maori-
landers will not grudge paying. They have not,
m fact, grudged paying even wheii it has been
for a Defence service which wasn’t worth
much more than a setting of brass farth-
ings. Political influence, woman influence, every
kind of influence that can rot a military
service, was the key and the pivot. Some of the
jobs that were perpetrated were so wicked that
the Government which countenanced them de-
served to go on the scrap-heap. Even under the
Kitchener scheme there certainly is no guarantee
that the potato is going to be clean, although the
war lord made a special plea that it should be
made and kept so. “ I wish,” said he, “to again
emphasise the importance of placing the ideal of
your defence on as high a standard of efficiency as
possible, in order that the men serving, as well as
the public, may have a just pride in the fighting
value of the force, and so insist upon the observ-
ance of the important principle that defence
should be outside party politics and not used by in-
dividuals for political purposes. A thorouyhly-
trained and efficiently-equipped force should be the
supreme object of your efforts, and no personal con-
siderations should, for a moment, be allowed to
stand in the way.’' Kitchener had evidently got
the hang of the position in M.L. when he wrote
that. But, under Ward, the defence department
has a better chance of being free of political
and personal interference than it had under
Skddon. And Ward also proposes a better
basis of defence than Seddon ever worked
upon. He has decided to continue the system
of compulsory service in the cadet and train-
ing corps until the age of 21, and (provided,
of course, that Parliament accepts his views) to
extend the age of service in the territorial army
to 25 years. Further—and this makes one of the
most interesting and important points of the
scheme—lOcadetsaretobe sent annually from M.L.
to the military training college for officers which is
to be established in Australia. This paves the
way to the complete adoption of the common-
sense view of Kitchener that the land
forces of Maoriland and the Commonwealth
should adopt homogeneous military systems,
so that they may most effectively sup-
port one another in the event of national
danger. Kitchener believed that uniformity in
training, as well as the closest ties of com-
i ideship in the two land forces, should be fos-
t«re \ and Ward declares himself an enthusiastic
supporter of that eminently sane view. And
there is every certainty that the Fisher Govern-
ment, with its sound views on defence, will hold
out the glad hand to the smaller brother, so that
when the day of the Blood-Red Sword does
arrive each may turn his face to the common
enemy with confidence in the other.

A Chronic Election Scandal.
One who signed himself “ A Federal M.P.” wrote
to the papers last week about the “cadging
crusade” which had advanced on his bank
account immediately after the late election. “A
man,” he said, after detailing some of the appeals
that had been made to him, “ is not elected to
Parliament simply to be made a target for
these pecuniary demands. The practice be-
comes a bribe on the part of the giver, and
blackmail on the part of the persons asking,”
Which puts the position correctly enough. In
most of the States there are Reps, who don’t begin
to need the £6OO per annum which Australia pays
its legislators for their labors. In some cases,
with an impressive show of public spirit, the
affluent ones refuse the allowance with the right
hand and afterwards grasp it unobtrusively with
the left, and pass it over to institutions in their
constituencies. In others, they spend it on
gifts, which are, in fact, bribes to supporters
spread over the three years they hold their seats,
or on mammoth public entertainments which
rage for weeks before polling-day. The effect is
to frustrate absolutely the object of pay-
ment of members. Parliamentarians like
Willy Kelly, of N.S.W., and Fairbairn,
of Vic., are patrons, presidents and vice-presidents
(at a guinea a time) of more swimming,
tennis, football, euchre, hockey, fishing, ping-
pong and bumble-puppy clubs than any four-score
citizens who are out of the political game. Their
cheques go to placate Hibernians on the one
hand and Derry-ites on the other : their donations
cheer in an equal degree Rechabites and anti-
Optionists, Puritans and chronic first-nighters,
Sabbatarians and advocates of an Open Sunday
for all and Dash the Collection-Plate. Mean-
while, abler and more useful men have to subsist
on their salaries, and appear, by comparison, mean
and uncharitable curmudgeons. In the Mac-
quare (N.S.W.) contest, almost the only com-
plaint lodged, on personal grounds, against
Laborite Carr, was that he didn’t (after the
manner of the affluent Liberal member for the
chief State seat of the constituency) “spend his
money like a gentleman.” They manage these
things better in England, as this cable message,
which arrived last week, indicates :
The election of Sir Christopher Furxkss (Liberal) to
the House of Commons for Hartlepool has been declared
void by the Elections Tribunal. Witnesses alleged that
700 miners were supplied with meals on tickets furnished
by Sir Christopher Furness’s agents or sub-agents.
In the East Sydney contest the “Liberal ” agents
also furnished 700 electors with free meals on one
memorable afternoon—and the Recording Angel
alone knows how many weren’t illegally fed on
other afternoons. In the powerfully “Liberal”
constituencies—notably Wentworth (N.S.W.) and
Balaclava (Vic.) —“ Liberal’’-owned motor-cars
and other vehicles were employed during the
whole of the 13th ult. carting voters to
the poll in open defiance of the Law.
And the numbers had hardly gone up when the
“ Liberal ” reps, started scattering their annual
subscriptions broadcast in the directions they
were likely to do most good. Under a Labor
Administration so much of this scandal as can be
squelched by law should Vie squelched. There is
not the remotest reason why the same police who
enforce the Early Closing Act against sweet-shop
owners who open on Sunday, shouldn’t be also
called on to enforce the bribery provisions of the
Electoral Act.
Labor, and a Hint to Avoid a Collision.
In the interval between wiping its axe after the
Federal elections and sharpening it for the N. iS.
Wales fray in September. Labor has an oppor-
tunity to consider its position regarding the Cold
Tea brigade. The chances of Labor coming
victorious out of the tussle with Wade are
brighter than they have ever been during the
leadership of McGowkn the Apologetic, and it
would be deplorable if Wade, Wood and Waddle
escaped by the intervention of a side-issue in the
shape of Cold Tea. Now that the Ma State has
its local option poll, it will not be many years
before it will find, as they have found in Maori-
land long since, that the policies of parties and
the benefits of government are practically de-
pendent upon the individual attitude of candi-
dates to the liquor question. Of 428,648 persons
who exercised a vote at the M.L. elections in
1908, no less than 384,033 turned thumbs down
for Bung ; consequently candidates mostly speak
to the No-License crank with their hats off.
For every blessed time the crank places
his mania before all other matters of State.
It hasn’t come to that yet in N.S.W.
altogether, but it is leaning in that direction, and
there is no time to be lost in propping the thing
up straight; for if Tea goes solid behind
Wade, up goes Wade’s flag again on the Treasury
benches. Already the sectarian tripe-hound has
been kicked out. of the kennel where he had laid
down to die, and the first splash of Cold Tea was
heard a few days ago when Canon Boyce (presi-
dent of the N. S. Wales Alliance) warned Deputy-
Labor-leader Holman that any attempt to adopt
his (Holman’s) suggestion to “ repeal some of the
more objectionable features of the recent liquor
legislation” would bring the whole brigade at
Labor s throat. Which is just a plain statement
of fact. If Holman thought to lassoo Bung with
that remark, and thus to get square, he made
an error. It will only appeal to that section of
Bung whose influence is already sure for Labor.
The other section is laying to another book. There
is an illusion that the Trade heaves its entire
backing behind the Labor party. It does nothing
of the kind. The Fat side of the business—in-
cluding brewery shareholders, wine and spirit
merchants and such like—wedges itself behind
tne Fat banner. That it doesn’t like the licensing
and local option laws that Wade has enacted
goes without saying; but it knows that
if Labor is returned to office there is no
more chance of the local option laws being
interfered with for Bung’s benefit than there
is under Wade; while there is the dead cer-
tainty that Bung will have to go back a bit, in a
few other directions. Wherefore, only half of
Bung will vote Labor. On the other side there is
a false belief in the Temperance mind that Labor
voters in the bulk are barrackers for Bung’s busi-
ness. As a matter of fact, Bung’s best barrackers
have been drawn from the ranks of those
who have hitherto stood to help alleged
Liberalism. It is so in N.S.W.; it is so
in every State. Then, again, quite a number
of unthinking persons (including some Labor poli-
ticians) accept it as a fact that the Cold Tea vote
can be counted against Labor as a matter of
course. This merely adds another wrong con-
clusion to the tally. Thousands of women alone
can be reckoned to vote no-license and Labor with
equal enthusiasm ; and in Labor’s mining strong-
holds especially, the leaders- of the Labor party —
including the Labor M’s.L. A—are almost without
exception pillars of local teetotalism. But the
Cold Tea vote is shy, and if it sees a halter in the
vicinity of a candidate or party, there will follow
a scatter of heels and a furious flurry for a
safer-looking paddock. Therefore, it becomes
necessary to assure Cold Tea that there is
no halter in the vicinity of the Labor lines,
that the liquor question stands or falls by its
own merits at the local option polls, and that
the Labor programme endorses and adopts
that view. It is perfectly true that the
Labor party’s programme ought to be well
enough known to escape any misconception ;
but, unfortunately for the party, some of
its members have made it necessary that the
party should explain definitely what its policy is
on the subject. Otherwise the election cannot
be fought safely. Cold Tea has set its heart on a
coup in September, and if it doesn’t bring it off it
will not be for the want of energy; and if Wade
can stampede Cold Tea, as a party, into his
corral, he can be relied upon to do it. Wherefore
the Labor party ought to get in early and spoil
the Wade party’s benevolent intentions.
An Opportunist that Failed.
Sam Maugkk, with the anguish of defeat rankling
in his bosom, has told his countrymen wliat he
thinks of them. Australians are “ignorant
people,” he said (1/5/TO): —
No one can have watched the recent, Federal elections
without coining to that conclusion. Men did not desire
to listen to reason and truth, or to follow the light.
They followed a blind impulse.... Tell me, are these
crowds untrained, untaught, and uneducated—grossly
ignorant crowds—the people you are going- to trust with
the safety of this Commonwealth ?
All that adjectival uproar and decayed fish because
MAUGKK turned his coat and discovered, when it
was too late, that the proposition wasn’t a paying
one ! When the three-card expert tries his fake
on a knowledgablecrowd and is turned down with
contempt, he has sufficient sense of humor and
proportion, generally, to take his reverse in
good part, He doesn’t accuse the populace
of being malignant ruffians because they let him
understand that they weren’t fools. There is a
valuable lesson to be learned by Samuel and
others like him in this regard. He Fused wiih his
eyes open, and in a state of absolute sobriety. He
did it because he believed the yarn of the anti-
Labor papers that Australia was sick of progres-
sive legislation, and averse from a further
instalment of Protection. Sam, as a life-long
high-tariffist, can’t have believed that Aus-
tralia’s existing inadequate duty-schedule was
sufficient. As a democrat, he can’t have
agreed with the view that the Common-
wealth didn’t need a progressive land-tax.
Panic smote him. Against all his expressed con-
victions he consented to betray Protection by
“sinking fiscalism ” ; and, so far as his views on
social legislation were concerned, to metamorphose
himself into the class of person who could stand
on the same platform with obstructionists and re-
actionaries like Joe Cook and Bruce Smith.
There is no doubt that he executed these somer-
saults because he thought they would pay. Had
the papers whose word he foolishly took been
able to assure him that he and his party would
win by declaring for a graduated land-tax and
higher duties, Samuel would undoubtedly have
adopted those views joyfully. And he would
have adopted then) with a clear conscience, for
they were the sort of views he has been voicing
ever since be has been in politics. As it turned
out. the anti-Labor papers were wrong. The
political principles the people really approved
were those which Maugkk. Dkakin and the rest
jettisoned in their wild chase after office. The
electors registered their opinion of Mauger’s dis-
ingenuous conduct by hurling him out of the seat
which he had occupied on the National ticket for
a decade. For this perfectly understandable, in-
telligent and equitable proceeding, Maugf.r rails
like a maddened fishwife. Instead, he ought to
thank his deposers. They have chastened him,
but in doing so they have taught him the useful
lesson that apostasy doesn’t pay in Australian
politics.

Wade says that things are going to be all right
on the N.S.W. railways when some of the country
lines are duplicated. Well, consider what is hap-
pening on the lines that are duplicated. For
months past not one-half of the trains on the main
suburban line in the busy parts of the day have
run to time. Yet that line is not merely dupli-
cated ; it is quadrupled. A recent train from
Strathfield to Sydney took 52 minutes to do the
seven miles. A freight train, Penrith to Clyde,
was over five hours getting over the 21 miles.
(Line duplicated.) A truck of wheat, Newtown
to Darling Harbor, took two days to get through
the three miles. (Line quadrupled.) A passenger
train, Penrith to Sydney, occupied 1 hour 51miu.
to do the 34 miles. (Line duplicated.) Thousands
of similar cases could be furnished. If N.S.W.
duplicates the country lines, and manages to in-
crease the traffic, and brings it all into Sydney,
the delays will be still worse. Even now, when
there is a little extra pressure, as at holiday times,
chaos reigns. If the duplications are going to do
what it is alleged they will do, and increase the
traffic all the time, the only conclusion possible is
that on the lines close up to Sydney there is going
to be chaos all the time. It is a pleasant prospect
for the Sydney suburban dweller ; and yet it is in
the interests of the Sydney suburban dweller that
the futile Wade Government proposes the mad
centralising scheme.
Labor in power, with an absolute majority in each
House of the Federation, will afford Australia an
example of the practical working of a uni-
cameral system. The two Houses will, of course,
exist; but, the Labor majority in the Senate
having the same principles as the Labor
majority in the Reps., there can be no con-
flict, no unnecessary postponement, no veto.
The Senate becomes wholly and solely a revising
Chamber ; that is, it becomes what under a uni-
cameral system would be called a revising com-
mittee. The advocates of the one-Chamber
system have always been met with the asser-
tion that the Legislative Councils are needed
to delay and, at times, reject the work of
the Assemblies. Most Councils confine them-
selves to these offices, and so congenial
is thatclassof obstruction, when popular measures
are on the board, that their value as revising
Chambers is insignificant. If a badly-drawn Bill
goes up from an Assembly it remains a badly-
drawn Bill; little or no attention is given to the
removal of obscurities or contradictions. In the
coming Parliament Australia will, for the first
time, have before it the spectacle of a Senate
majority in agreement with the Government m
the Reps. ; and, having no postponing or vetoing
offices to perform, it will be thrown on to work of
a revising character —to making the meaning o a
passage clearer or excising clauses out of harmony
with the measure. The Parliamentary lesson
will be worth the study of all bicameral countries.
“ 0.K.” : To me it seems that a most important
factor in the recent election triumph of the Labor
party was the winsome title thereof, as contrasted
with the title of the other party. Who wouldn t
vote for “Labor” against “Fusion”? Yet the
fatuous organs of the precious “ I usion Minis-
try were not content to keep quiet on this point.
They persisted in railing at the term “Labor, as
though it carried its own condemnation rather
than its own recommendation. It was Labor
proposes” to do this, “Labor threatens to do
that, or “Labor is prepared ” to do the other
thing. The attractive term, intended to be one
of reproach, was rubbed into the minds of every-
body who works for a living, with the result that
tens of thousands who had never voted for the party
before said “Good old Labor!” and voted foi
it this time. Editors of Liberal-Tory news-
papers are lacking in the showman’s instinct,
seemingly. They can’t judge the value of adver-
tising phrases or they could never have allowed
the Labor party a monopoly of its badge, nor,
having allowed it, would they have drawn so
much attention to it. “Labor” is just the finest
title that ever a political party possessed, and the
wonder is that a wily old battler like Deakin was
so stupid as to let his opponents be confirmed in
the possession of it. The same mistake is made by
the supporters of Liquor in allowing the R,echa-
bites to brand themselves “ Temperance.” The
virtue of that term is beginning to count a lot.
As long as the anti-everything fanatics were called
“Teetotallers,” they were derided, and, even
when they first claimed the title of the “ Temper-
ance ” party, derision still clung to them. But the
virtue in the name commends it to the ear.
Temperance party ! How well it sounds ! It
casts a reflection of intemperance on its opponents
even as the term Labor party suggests that its
opponents are the Loafer party.
<3,
Still hammering on its burst old Freetrade in-
strument, the Sydney Telegraph (6/5/TO) came
out with the following :
The cable this morning reports the Duke of Devonshire
as pointing out that workers in Great Britain have bene-
fited by advances in wages and declines in the prices of
commodities. As Great Britain is a Freetrade country
that is quite feasible. Given such a rise in wages as has
been steadily evidenced there for some years, the effect
upon prices is mitigated in an open market which
encourages competition and so prevents combination
among manufacturers, producers, or distributors to levy
whatever they see fit to extort. In Germany, the United
Stares and other protected countries the wage-earner has
no such safeguard.
Meanwhile the New York correspondent of
London Daily Express had this to say (28/3/TO):
One hundred and fifty skilled British artisans, includ-
ing mechanics, bricklayers and similar workers, arrived
in New York yesterday aboard the Columbia. They state
that 4000 others are leaving England because there is no
work to be had. They declared to newspaper representa-
tives who interviewed them :
“England is played out. Unemployment is now a
normal condition. VVe have decided not to remain to
add to the appalling unemployed army. We intend to
settle here and become American citizens.”
The workers are all fine specimens of young manhood
in the prime of life. Work is awaiting them here at wages
varying from £3 to £7 a week.
The plain moral is that lowered prices are of no
earthly use to the British wage-earner when there
are no wages to be earned. Lowered prices are
only of value to people like Freetrade British
dukes who don’t need to chase the elusive wage-
bird to keep body and soul together.

Henry Fletcher advocates a graduated litera-
ture tax :
I want to rouse up Australian writers, or persons who
might be writers, to demand some of the protection to
their work that is given to other trades. The foolish-
ness of a country allowing itself to be a dumping-ground
for another country’s goods is now understood ; but it
has yet to be realised that the folly is even greater if
the matter dumped is ideas in commercial form. That
is, foreign literary matter fit for local reproduction.
As dumping of goods kills local industries, so this dump-
ing of imported ideas stunts or destroys the local
literary production. With only two or three exceptions,
the entire press of the Commonwealth makes up a
large portion of its reading matter with dumped
goods. But the moral sense of the press is
so blunted by custom or necessity that even dump
price is not paid; the matter is brazenly stolen.
It follows that the local writer, unless he confines himself
to local color or circumstance, is handicapped out of the
business. If we believe, with Emerson, that the thinker
or writer is the most precious person in the community,
the present system is little better than national mental
suicide.' To encourage a true and vigorous Australian
sentiment, we must have Australian thinkers ; and they
are best provided by a fairly-paid band of w riters.
Wanted, then, a graduated literature tax to touch
the big thief papers where they will feel it most.
Briefly, the proposed law should demand of every
serial publication or newspaper its average circu-
lation. This would be the basis for graduating the tax.
The tax would be a price per column for reprinted
matter not printed in the'nature of a quotation. The
money collected, less expenses, should be paid to the
original English, American or foreign authors on their
application. The effect of such a law would be to kill
stone dead a whole range of thief-rags, and to induce
established papers of importance to largely increase their
literary staff. It would then be possible for local writers
on all subjects to find a market for their wares. I call on
the local journalists and W'riters who have not yet been
Starved out of their native country to take up pen and
speech in their own defence. Let each paper, according
to grade, not only have to pay a fixed rate for borrowed
matter, but. also a minimum rate for original stuff. Thus
would the public be saved much tripe. Will fellow ink-
spillers help me to make this a live question—to stir up
their societiesand their local Federal representatives, and
so make the writing craft a worthy trade to the new
Australians?

Melbourne’s Shopkeepers’ Association has cele-
brated the first anniversary of the Saturday half-
holiday’s birthday with a dinner and the state-
ment that its 4000 members, after 12 months’ ex-
perience, were unanimously satisfied. When the
innovation happened a year ago the usual Tories
predicted the usual ruin, and sundry greedy
sweaters wailed piteously about the poor widow
and the small shopkeeper; but the poor widow still
keeps moving along, and the small shopkeeper
has found that his takings certainly haven’t
shrunk. It will be just the same when the Eight
Hours and Minimum Wage laws are made to
apply to the agricultural laborer and other people.
A lot of twaddle,.a few moans, and in 12 months’

otherwise.
From a leading article in the British Austral-
asian (17/3/TO) on the subject of G. H. Reid’s
recent Colonial Institute speech :
Another matter upon which Mr. Reid did much to dis-
pel wrong ideas was that of the so-called Soci dism of
Australia. It is true that the State there has undertaken
many enterprises which in England remain in private
hands, but though these may be called Socialistic, they
differ from the Socialism which aims at abolishing
Private Enterprise because they are designed, while safe-
guarding the public from the evils of private monopoly,
A Song of the Old Men.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oh ! warily walked the old men
In the rut where the old men go,
Repeating the old traditions
That only the old men know ;
Solemnly walked the old men
With their stately gait and slow.
No fear was there for the old men ;
Cunning in plenty had they—
The cunning that shirks the battle
And edges out of the fray ;
But the old men were spent missiles,
They cumbered the nation’s way.
As flame to the whisp’ring forest,
As rain to the land of drouth,
The young men swept to the rescue
From the North and West and South
And each had a mighty purpose
And the same word in his mouth.
“ Peace in our time ! ” prayed the old men
Frightened of battle and scar ;
“Our flesh is fain for the feasting,
We dwell from all strife afar.
Lo ! all but the wise shall perish
Who counter this Avatar !
“ Too straight and strong are the young men ;
Hot with Youth’s holy fire.
Shall they heed our lamentations
Who baulked them of their desire ?
Nay, certes, they’ll plough us under,
And make of our plans a pyre ! ”
Ah ! wearily walk the old men;
They cry to the skies their woe,
And wail for the old traditions,
Fast perishing as they go.
To Nirvana drift the old men,
Gripped in Fate’s undertow.
VICTORIA.

This is the same G. H. Rkid who inaugurated the
now moribund Anti-Sosh agitation, alleging that
the raising of this issue was so hideously
necessary as to call for the sacrifice even of Free-
trade. It is the same G. H. Reid who. in the
closing days of 1900, claimed that the So-
cialistic Menace, or “Tiger” as he termed it, was
so real that homes were in danger of bursting
and religion was threatened, and every industry,
from the lollipop-calling upwards, was in peril of
nationalisation ; the same G. H. Rkid who, in a
final newspaper appeal before polling-day three
years back, insulted the collective intelligence of
Australia by asking it to vote for bis party and
against Anauchy ! Surely it is the master Yes-
No of the astounding old mountebank’s career.

“ Whitehall ”:
The most notable thing about the late King was his
personal popularity. Id didn’t arise, as a certain
beslavering class of “ Loyalist ” would make out, from
tiie uncompromising way he did his duty. The Kaiser
has tojled far harder all his life, in this respect, than his
uncle in Britain ever did. As a matter of fact, Edward
side-stepped the ultra-boring exigencies of his calling
with a good deal of resoluteness.
Nothing happened in his reign to add to the martial
glory of the British Empire. On the contrary. He
just reached the throne in time for the dreary, unin-
spiring finish of the most discreditable war of modern
times. A Napoleon or a Frederic may be a hog and yeD
become enshrined in Dhe hearts of his countrymen by
reason of the fame ho has won for their arms. Not only
did Edward VII. not win any great battle; none was
won in his reign.
Tnere was nothing spectacular about him. At the
funeral of Queen Victoria he was about the most “un-
kingly ” figure in the procession. Been flashing througli
tile streets of London in his little one-horse brougham,
he suggested a doctor on his way to a case.
He cnose his intimate friends, male and female, arbit-
rarily, and they weren’t always by any means people
whom either “Society” or the nation would have chosen
for him. No public man in England considered the
immensely powerful Nonconformist conscience less than
Edward. He habitually did things that a mere politician
would have been terrified to do. Speaking generally,
he went out of his way to placate no one. And
yet by all classes, through the length and breadth of
Great Britain, if one excepts those whom Cardinal Moran
terms “ Wowsers,” he was adored.
My explanation is that it was a case of a naturally
charming personality expressed to the public througli
the illustrated and personal papers. The his-
torians won’t do justice to the truth unless they
carefully deal with the press factor in the dead
monarch’s career—a factor which practically hasn’t
existed in the case of any other British sovereign. Day
after day and week after week the readers of every jour-
nal, from the Daily Mirror at id. to the big illustrated
weeklies and monthlies, were presented with photographs
of the King doing all those things which the normal
Briton deems most worthy. And whether the snap-
shotters portrayed him leading in his Derby winner at
Epsom, or yachting at Cowes, or shooting driven phea-
sants in Norfolk, or riding a pony on the treeless
waste of a Scotch deer-“ forest,” he was always perform-
ing jovially, in immaculately correct garb and as to the
manner born. A sovereign whom the press depicted con-
stantly engaged in literary work, or surrounded
by the retorts and stoppered phials of the laboratory,
or_ whose relaxation consisted, as in the case of the
Prince of Monaco, in deep-sea exploration and research,
or who was a fanatical musician, would not have appealed
to the British imagination. One of an aggressively-
religious mind would have revolted it. Ed. VII. won the
name of being a “ good sportsman ” —a supreme claim to
the Briton’s regard and veneration.
As a matter of fact, he wasn’t a great sportsman in the
sense that, say, the German Emperor is. Unlike the
boar-slaying Kaiser, he hated hunting. He rode badly.
He never drove, or concerned himself with the naviga-
tion of his yachts. His shooting—a matter of sitting
outside a covert or behind a butt on a shooting stick for a
few hours, before and after an ornate sit-down lunch —
was more in the nature of an execution or other ceremony
than a sport. Racing is a pastime that has worshippers
who never dream of setting up as sportsmen. Those who
knew him best agreed that, at heart, he was a townsman.
The Parisians who preferred him before any of the hordes
of royalties they had met, nicknamed him “Le bon,
banquier Juif.” There was justice in the title. He had
many of the tastes and characteristics of the best sort of
Jew—which is high praise. He had the artistry and
eclecticism which Victoria lacked, as was indicated by
the comprehensive holocaust of Royal palace eye-
sores that occurred as soon as he reached the
throne. No man knew more about food, wines
and cigars than he did; withal he was temperate
as the high-class Jew mostly is and the Goelpii mostly
hasn’t been. He was a passionate lover of the theatre
and opera—he actually died of a chill caught theatre-
going. It used to be said 10 years ago that, after Lord
Russell of Killowen, he played cards with more zest than
any man in the kingdom. Of course, he played far better
than the late 0.J., being reputed one of the best whist,
bridge, andpiequet players in Europe. He betted gamely
and consistently. The stock and share market engrossed
him. And so on.
Business was his strong suit, and the calm, sane,
tolerant, fair-minded temperament which the best sort
of business man owns was his most useful mental
asset. He was the most successful sovereign England
ever had, mainly because he was its first business-king.
It is a blistering indictment of the monarchical system
when one comes to think of it.

The Bulletin’s tame policeman writes :
Maoriland has decided upon a reorganisation of its
prison system, and the new scheme (which is to some
extent based on N. S. Wales lines) will go into opera-
tion gradually. Provision is made for penitentiaries for
male prisoners, including an institution for sexual per-
verts and criminals of unsound mind, an institution for
incorrigible drunks, prison camps, a reformatory farm,
and a penitentiary and reformatory' for women. The
drunk, whether he be casual, occasional or habitual,
comes in for special consideration in which probationary
treatment is the main spring. For instance, the
occasional “ tight,” on being committed by a
magistrate, will be handed over to an officer
in charge of a probationary institution. Every
morning the Occasional, after having breakfast in the
half-quod, will be sent away to his job in the town—that
is, if the boss hasn’t fired him in the meantime—and
every night he must return to the semi-lockup—that is,
if he doesn’t clear out instead of going to his job. Every
pay day his wages, less the cost of his board and lodging
in the partial-jug, will be collected by a Jonathan Hopp
and handed over to his wife—if he has one. If he hasn’t
got one she won’t get any of the wages. By-and-bye, if
the Occasional gets back promptly to the modified cage
when the evening sun is sloping steeply to the west, and
if he doesn’t raise a disturbance or try to run the rabbit
before bed time, he will be allowed to sleep at
his own home on one specified night a week to
begin with, which night will be known as “ Pa’s
night in ” —that is, if he has a home. If he lias no home,
it will be Pa’s night out, and, by starting early, he can
get a good load on board and sleep it off before it is time
to go to work next day. Then, after drinking a pint of
the dog that bit him, say at 11 a.m., he’ll be right, so
that when the time comes for his return to the quasi-
tollbooth he can pull the bell with a firm hand and
breathe on the warder with impunity. On the whole,
the scheme gives an assurance of free board and lodging
at a jug-cum-temperance hotel, with a sporting chance
on a quick-fire corkscrew between meals.
The picture of the late King, printed to-
day, is from an artist’s proof engraving of a
very recent portrait painted by Tennyson Cole.
Messrs. Grace Bros., of Sydney, lately introduced
this fine picture and other engravings to Australia.
There could be no better illustration of the need
of a Greater Sydney, to grapple with the whole
question of the congested state of the city arid its
approaches and water-ways, than the proposal of
the Sydney Harbor Trust to build a new wharf for
the Orient Co. at tremendous expense atßennelong
Point, Fort Macquarie. To get this wharf con-
structed several reefs, as well as the whole of the
existing services to and from that part of the
harbor, must be shifted. This means the removal
of the horse and vehicle ferry to Dawes Point,
where the other North Shore horse-punt is. It is
then proposed to run one punt diagonally across
to Milson’s Point, and the other, as hitherto, to
Blue’s Point. This not only will seriously en-
danger navigation, which is already over-
dangerous. but will further congest city vehicular
traffic. The way to Dawes Point is through
George-street, and under the suggested “im-
provement” scheme, all the trade between the
city and North Sydney will have to join the mael-
strom that already seethes round Circular Quay
and George-street North.

In the N.S.W. Marine Court of Inquiry, last
week, Judge Backhouse gave a judgment which
made shellbacks stare in wonder. It was the
Manapouri-Gratitude case : there had been a col-
lision, and the second officer of the Manapouri
blamed for it. As for the tug Gratitude, that
boat “had not, as was required by law, a second
certificated officer.” Further, “it was absolutely
immaterial whether the second light was on the
Gratitude or not.” Thirdly, the Gratitude’s
“ whole story was unreliable”; and the Court “had
a very strong suspicion” that even the captain was
“merely a dummy aboard.” Yet, after calling on
the Manapouri’ssecond officer to come up and bring
his ticket, the Court concluded (S. M. Herald
report): “ The Navigation Department was not
in any way to blame.” Under the circumstances,
it would be interesting to know who is to blame
(apart, of course, from the; owners) if a vessel
doesn’t carry a second certificated officer, if the
one certificated officer is a dummy, and if vessels
don’t carry the lights that they should carry in
accordance with Article 3 of the Board of Trade
Regulations for the Rule of the Road.
The Victorian Attorney-General was tackled the
other day by a reporter regarding his statement
that the heart’s desire of his department was to
“ keep down expenses.” That may, of course,
be the dearest wish of the Minister’s heart; but
some recent proceedings in the matter of alleged
subornation of perjuries, and some further
proceedings on the charge of alleged con-
spiracy to procure perjury, have presented an
appearance of much expensiveness. In the latter
case the expenses were piled up for several weeks,
yet in the end the alleged conspirators were not
even committed for trial. This would have been
a pretty bad reflection on the judgment of the
Crown Law Department’s regular legal advisers
had they advised this fruitless expenditure
Of coin. But it was reported to the press
that the three advisers attached to the Crown
Law Department had not been consulted as to the
laying of the conspiracy charge. Inconsequence
of that report the Attorney-General was in vited
to state whether the extra expense of obtaining
outside opinions had been incurred in this case.
His reply was a burst of indignation. In peremp-
tory tones he ticked the questioner off. He re-
fused to say who had been consulted. Moreover,
he declared that the matter of the alleged con-
spirators was still sub judice. From which it
seems that the Vic. Attorney-General is even
less disposed to drop some prosecutions when the
evidence tells him to do so than to take up other
cases in which the evidence screams for the
attention of the Crown.
A Recollective Rhyme.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I lost a friend the other day,
King Edward he was called ;
On his account a shrill “ hooray ”
I oftentimes have bawled
When people cried, “Here comes the
Prince! ”
Young, handsome then, and slim.
Nigh fifty years have aged me since
I first hoorayed for him.
Anon they spoke of him as “ wild ” ;
Maybe they spoke the truth.
The man I’d cheered for when a child,
I envied in my youth.
To be the Prince and “go the pace,”
A halo rimmed his head ;
Methought, if I were in his place,
I’d paint the kingdom red.
And when the fever laid him low
And grim Death hovered near.
On wintry nights I’d, willing, go
To Mansion House to hear
About the Prince. It seemed, indeed,
He was the friend of all,
So eagerly folks rushed to read
The notice on the wall.
The Wonders of Thanksgiving Night
Stay pictured on my brain.
In London streets, ablaze with light,
I push my way again.
A merry peal the Bow Bells ring,
Bright bunting braves the gales ;
Round Temple Bar the masses sing
“God bless the Prince of Wales ! ”
“ Disloyal” thoughts of crowns and thrones
I harbored then, as now ;
Before a god of flesh and bones
My knee refused to bow ;
But, through the glamor of the Court
Where he was born to fame,
I viewed him as a manly sport
Who played a royal game.
And now lie’s dead—“the Prince ” of old.
The King of recent times ;
His knell the muffled bell has tolled
That erst rang out in chimes.
Grey shades of reverie descend,
The light is growing dim ;
My mind has lost its fancied friend,
It mourns the death of him.

“Carmen ” at the Royal, postponed from
Saturday, was played for the first time by the
Grand Opera co. on Monday to a full house,
partly o’erlaid with black, though no specially-
funereal trimmings adorned the building itself.
With Bel Sorel as the alluring gipsy, and the
“CARMEN” AT THE ROYAL (SYDNEY).
Tenor Blamcly spurned by Bel Sorel. (Damage
prevented by three energetic supers.)
stout Blarney as her victim, Don Jose, and a good
chorus, things might reasonably have been ex-
pected to go better than they did. Most of the
characters would have been better if they had
been worse, for they all had a subdued and
respectable air. Carmen herself didn’t even
have the hole in her stocking which her author
took the trouble to describe. The performance
was, on the whole, rather like an undertaking by
the “ gifted amateurs ” of some up-country town
in the local School of Arts, in aid of the district hos-
pital. Hazon stood up to his work manfully, and
the orchestra responded well, giving to the
catchy, fascinating music all the effect which
could be put into it. About the best scene
in the opera was the one between Jose and Car-
men at Lilas Pastia’s tavern, where both tenor
and mezzo-soprano rose to the occasion.
Bel Sorel looked a “cheeky” little thing; but
she took herself rather too seriously in the Haba-
nera, to which vocal seduction Jose yielded in a
matter-of-fact way because it was in his part, and
not because he felt that Carmen was the only girl
in the world for him. Maria Pampari was well
received as Michaela. The audience liked the
cigar girls as much as anybody, and it espe-
cially applauded the cave scene, which was a
beautiful piece of stage-setting; indeed, the
whole production was good in that respect. The
smugglers (R. Fergusson and E. Wynn) came out
strong in that scene. And so did Rosina Buek-
rnann and Mabel Batchelor as the gipsy girls. The
Australasian contingent gave a very good account
of themselves; and the Cleveland-street Public
School boys sang up bravely in the street scene.
As the Toreador, Antonio Zanelli looked a perfect
dream, but he should have unstopped his ears and
listened to the orchestra, for he got sadly off the
note. The familiar Toreador’s song he soliloquised
rather than sang, as if he were rather afraid the
bull would charge him and chase him round the
ring. Perhaps he was nervous. But what’s the
use of a nervous bull-fighter? Estimating
Eseamillo Zanelli’s fighting prowess on the basis of
his vocal form," it would be picking up money to
back the bull every time this Toreador was billed
to appear in the Plaza de Toros. Alternating
“Carmen” and “La Boheme” for the week,
with a “ Butterfly ” matinee, the Opera co. will
say “ Good-bye ” on Friday.
*****
Next Saturday evening Julius Knight and
Katherine Grey return to Sydney Theatre
Royal with “ The Third Degree.” “The Third
Degree” has been described as a play which
would give nerve-tremors to a brass idol. As it
deals with N’Yark police methods this apprecia-
tion is doubtless a just one.
** * *
The Stage Society, whose admirable aim
it is to spread the correct dramatic light in the
dark places of local theatredom, prpduced St.
John Hankin’s “The Cassilis Engagement,” at
the Standard Theatre last week. The play is a
slight, uneventful affair. If it points any moral
it is the highly-debatable one that the Cockney
girl can’t settle down resignedly in an English
country house—a theory to which the cases of
Connie Gilchrist, Belle Bilton, Rosie Boote and
innumerable others give the lie. The dialogue is
bright and witty throughout, and the situations
are diverting.
* * * *
A fatuous youth is Geofirey Cassilis, and,
after the manner of flis kind, he has got en-
gaged to a girl who is utterly antipathetic
to his lady-mother. The girl is afflicted with a
female progenitor whose production in a court of
law would, in the writer’s view, ruin her child’s
chances of success in any of the breach of pro-
mise actions harped on during the play, how-
ever flagrant the guilt of the defendant. Nothing
like her occurs outside the environment of a slum
police-court. One of the startling features of the
show was the uncanny calm with which the
characters accepted the antics of this astounding
apparition. Mrs. Cassilis adores her foolish son,
and is loath to forbid the banns outright.
She decides to pit the cunning of the worldly
expert against both the attraction of the girl
and the wiles of the disreputable old ruin
who is her mother. She has them to stay
with her in the country, bores them
to death, and impresses on the girl that this is
the sort of life she is in for with Geoffrey. To
the wild, explosive grief of her mother, the girl
breaks the engagement and returns to the lights
and crowds of London. The boy, we are given
to understand, will shortly make a suitable alli-
ance with a pleasing young woman of title.
* * * *
On the opening night the players were
handicapped by the weather. The Standard
Theatre has a roof which grows riotously vocal
during a rain storm, and defeats all but the most
articulate stage-conversation. After a while this
structure burst or something, and the spectators
had to take to their umbrellas. Meanwhile,
the bass viol exploded deafeningly and created
a panic and disorganised things generally. In
the middle of the second act the curtain had to
be let down till the elements let up. None but
seasoned professionals could do their lines justice
in such circumstances. Doubtless, as a result, the
unusual effect was produced of screaming farce
proceeding contemporaneously, and on the same
stage, with perfectly rational light comedy. While
Mrs. T. H. Kelly was playing Mrs. Cassilis with
distinction and charm, and in a series of delight-
ful Paris frocks, and while Miss Dorothy Grim-
ston, as Lady Marchmont, was supplying a faith-
fully-drawn picture of a managing society
dame, Miss Hillier (Mrs. Borridge) raged round
in the garish attire and distracted coiffure of a
Tivoli ‘'comedienne,” and Mr. Montagu Stephen
presented a footman who would be excluded with
violence from any seriously conducted registry office.
A. Champion, who played Geoffrey Cassilis, would
have been more convincing had he stuck through-
out to a sac suit. In Leicestershire, the young
squire who goes hacking in the riding-breeches of
an Australian mounted policeman is morally cer-
tain to be regarded as an eccentric —if not a
Socialist. Mr. Innes-Noad did some good work as
Major Warrington, though his martial jauntiness
grew trying at times. Miss K. Beattie (Ethel
Borridge) was excellent in a heavy and difficult
part. It was a creditable show all round, and
deserved better luck than it got.

For four nights more Oscar Asche and
Lily Brayton will horrify and enthral in “Count
Hannibal” at Sydney Criterion. Then Miss
Hutin Britton and Matheson Lang—one of the
few pros, who can claim an Archbishop for a
cousin—will supplant them at the old Pitt-street
stand; and the play they mean to do it in is
Hall Caine’s “Pete.”

This is the. second-last notice The Bulle-
tin will issue that “ Aladdin” is in its expiring
nights at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), so it hereby
urges the dilatory person, who has not yet seen
the show, to suspend all engagements for at least
one evening and hurry along; for the next time
this paper speaks, Time’s hammer will be hover-
ing above the auctioneer’s desk, the second yell
of “Going!” will be ringing in th?s air, and
“ Gone! ” will be imminent.

At Sydney Tivoli the black capitals that
denote the star are pretty evenly distributed.
The Howards with their thought-reading act are
the biggest draw on the bill ; but the real sweets
6f entertainment are handed out by other per-
formers. Olive Lenton and her team of eight
girls are a cheerful and tuneful circumstance—or
nine cheerful circumstances; Alburtus and Millar
supply some good cornet-playing and fooling;
the Two Falcons slide cheerfully through a smart
acrobatic turn ; and Fred Bluett —comedian and
military reformer—nightly earns a national grant
and his country’s eternal gratitude by his joyous
burlesque of the Boy Scout. During the week.
Fanny Powers, the Wheelers, Baby Watson and
several others have been added to the bill,
thereby enhancing the value of that document
and adding considerably to its length. Happy
Tom Parker is announced to depart about Friday
night; his cheerful feet and smile will be sadly
missed.

cash taken at the box office, and the tiger cools
himself after the show with a fan made of bank
notes,; also, the management’s safe having shown
signs of giving way under the strain, the
elephant’s trunk is now used to hold the small
ehange. Any burglar who is disengaged and feels
up to breaking into an elephant has a chance
to get rich.

West’s Sydney Pictures are back at the
cosy little Palace Theatre, where a start was made
on Monday night. Interest centred on a series
showing the late Edward visiting the Dread-
nought and the present royalties follow-
ing in his train. When loyalty had duly
found expression, the fancy turned lightly
to thoughts of sport; and Barry, the English
champion sculler, was shown on the Thames
training for his race with Dick Arnst on the
Zambesi. This evoked great enthusiasm, and
with artistic completeness the management then
put on one showing Dick Arnst training on the
Parramatta for the race with Barry. If the films
are to be relied upon, Barry is a fine sculler and a
solid lump of muscle, who will take some
walloping.

At the Sydney Lyceum, Spencer’s Theatre-
scope is showing a delightful trip through Fin-
land. The Finns may have a lot to put up with,
but they have some consolations in the shape of
scenery. The film is well taken, well printed,
and the toning is a masterpiece. “The Power
of the Press” is a misnomer; it should be
changed to “The Advisability of Making
Friends with your Enemy’s Niece.” The story
of this wild, woolly production is that of the
local luminary versus the corruption of the Mayor
of a western town in the U.S.A. The “graft-
ing” Mayor drums one editor out of the town, and
proceeds to try to bulldoze his successor. But
this American editor, like all Australian press-
men, is beyond the power of bribery. He bashes
the grafters harder than the man he has suc-
ceeded, till in desperation the Mayor, masked,
with a band of ruffians, breaks into the
sanctum, kidnaps the boss, bears him to
a quiet spot, and commences to make
arrangements to hang him. But before he is
hauled up the Mayor’s niece, who is in love with
the editor—he had published a poem of hers—
arrives with the police, and the Press comes out
on top. Hanging the fleeting moment on the
topical peg, Spencer reels off a collection of King
portraits. One effect of these pictures is to knock
nut theidea, carefully fostered bv portrait-makers,
that Edward VII. was a tall, commanding person ;
they show that he looked a business-like gentle-
man, with a figure.

The Standard Theatre, which is in Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, will burst into a four weeks’
season of vaudeville on Saturday, May 14, when
a capable co. organised by William Anderson,
and including Nat Clifford, will take the boards,
while the public takes the chairs. Popular prices
are to prevail.
“ WHEN KNIGHTHOOD WAS IN FLOWER ”
AT MELBOURNE PRINCESS’S.
J. B. Athol-wood as the
Duke of Buckingham.
Hareonrt Beatty as
Charles Brandon.
The Melbourne showmen’s general out-
break of mourning for the late King: on Saturday
last,_ which was neither the day of his death nor
of his funeral, seemed more extraordinary in the
case of the Picture houses than the theatres.
What sentimental exception could have been
taken to a Picture show, divested of farcical-
comedy features, on the day after the King’s
•demise? Apparently the incitement to close all
shows came from theatre managements, who had
most fear of an empty house, and, therefore, most
reason for urging unanimity of action. Melbourne
city streets were crowded on Saturday night with
people who had been at least prepared to accept
cinematographic consolation in their sadness.
They merely “ mooned ” around, musing the in-
consistency of amusement caterers’ conduct, and
wondering what rule of official etiquette had
ordained the proclamation of a civil-service holi-
day for the coming Monday. The “mooning”
crowds were not panic-stricken. They had struck
a panic; but their withers were unwrung.

At the Royal, where the Arcadians con tin ue
to trill their lay in blissful ignorance of rent and
taxes and bitter beer and things, a University
Night was arranged for Friday. At time of
writing the eventuation of this uproarious gather-
ing on the appointed date was problematical ;
therefore intending patrons of the function are
advised to watch the advts. and keep their
powder dry. Anyhow, “The Arcadians” will be
there until further notice. The Simple Life has
got to be lived, and the Well of Truth, where
Simplicitas left his trou-sers, shows no signs of
running dry. Also, cadaverous Doody has gotter
motter which should be framed and glazed for
common domestic application.

In last Bulletin the forthcoming trans-
ference of Nellie Stewart and co. from the Prin-
cess’s to Her Majesty’s was duly announced. The
time of “When Knighthood Was In Flower”
will cease on Friday, after which Hugh Ward will
introduce “ The Uirl from Rector’s ’’ at the Prin-
cess’s. The posters depict her as a somewhat
giddy girl, and Ward states, firstly, that she is
French by birth though ’Murkan by extraction :
and, secondly, that she reaches the limit of possible
mirth.
One more revival of “Sweet Nell” is to
follow the musical comedy season at her Majesty’s.
This time Harcourt Beatty will return to his old
position as King Charles, and sit in his high-
backed chair whilst Nellie Stewart feeds him with
blandishments. The Court is to stay only a week
in its unwonted domicile. When the reprehen-
sible monarch and his ungodly entourage have
moved away, the Royal Comics will come back to
their Melbourne friends and all will be forgiven.
Their first intention is “A Waltz Dream.”
** * *
Three long years and a bit have elapsed
since Anderson staged “The Village Blacksmith ”
at the Royal. He did it some more at the King’s
the other night, when the plot seemed to be the
same compound of guilty passion, abduction,
dying cheeild, reconciliation, and wrestling match
as it was in the beginning and ever shouldn’t be.
The villain of this rather tedious nightmare is
naively described as “an athlete and a rogue.”
His athleticism is the undoing of him. Had he
stuck strictly to roguery he might have carried a
crop of grey hairs in sinfulness to the grave;
but, being short of cash, he challenges
the world to take him on at catch-as-
catch-can, and the Village Blacksmith gets
him in a hamrnerlock, and turns the key and breaks
his neck. The fact that the wrastler looks half a
yard taller than the lurid villain is easily accounted
for. The villain is an ill weed, who grows apace,
and on this occasion he just sprang up to
meet the foe. Still, Miss Duggan identifies the
corpse with a cry of “Thank God!” And she
ought to know—he has pursued her with odious
attentions through four acts. Furthermore, he
stole her child and drove her husband, the smith,
to drink, which was very careless of him. The
smith sobers up, but not too soon. When he
enters the arena the memory of his bygone beers
nerves him to concert pitch apd pulls him
through.
* * * *
Apart from its final act of violence. “The
Village Blacksmith” is not a strikingly original
drama. The situations are mostly moss-grown,
saving an absurd matter of a “faked” wedding
ring ; the dialogue is as familiar in the characters’
mouths as household bread ; the sick child seems
very like a sufferer one has met before. George
G'ross is the horny-handed artisan ; Rutland
Beckett is the wicked captain who adds a cubit to
his stature ; Miss Duggan plays the matron in
distress ; and Max Clifton, Bert Bailey and others
help to carry on the bad work, or keep the audi-
ence engaged whilst the scenery is being shifted.
The scenery is a large item that requires a deal of
shifting.

Lily Langtry, the lively, and Tom Dawson,
the lugubrious, have lately returned to the Opera
House—the bill in other respects being a seasoned
document with Carter Conjurius in the place of
prefect. This is the last week of Graham and
Dent, who are always acceptable and often desir-
able. There are other people whose last week is
a terrible long time in coming. And there is
Billy Williams, of whom it has been remarked
that The Bulletin ought to say something. The
trouble is to say something more suitable than an
eloquent silence.
** * *
“ The Sailor’s Wedding,” by Brinsley Hill,
which made a first Australian appearance at Ade-
laide Royal, proves to be very usual modern melo-
drama. It is breezy and humorous, cleverly con-
structed, and not too wildly improbable in general
idea; but there are occasional bits that show the
author’s contempt of the intelligence of an
audience that demands them. For example:
Drake is on a British warship in Italy. He fights
a duel with a native, and has tne luck to disarm
him. “Strike, signor! The victory is yours.”
says a nobleman—the other man’s second !
And he says it simply to let Drake lower
his point, and intone: “No, I am an Eng-
lish sail-or, and I cannot kill a defenceless
man.” It is Drake who has to say nearly all the
silly things. “I’d give a year of my life to press
her hand again,” is one of them. The girl at the
time is in the next room, and he can (and two
minutes later does) have a talk with her by saying
he would like to. She is daughter, to a count who
might be a reigning prince if he would get rid of
his wife and marry a Russian princess. (This is
obscure, and nothing comes of it.) “I have you
in my power,” says the villainous Ferici to him
often. “Bah ! yon are under my thumb,” says
the lurid Lenore to Ferici. “Death and I are
waiting for you together,” she is told by
her Polite Lunatic of a husband, who per-
vades the middle distance with a dagger till it
is time to run for the train. Then she dies
laughing and unbeaten, and with her last breath
accuses Drake of the deed. The acting is at
least as good as the stuff deserves. Inman
romps through the heroism, and Dalgleish
through the villainy. Florence Richter scores
heavily as the irrepressible Lenore, most danger-
ous when chuckling. Mabel Hardinge has come
into the co. to play the heroine, and Harrie Ire-
land is quietly effective as her persecuted mother.
Harry Douglas gets right into the skin of the
semi-royal Count, made up like Napoleon the
Third. Roy Redgrave for once plays a comic part
—an English Johnnie, shrewd enough underneath
an idiotic exterior; he reproduces Howard
Vernon’s jerky walk and chirpy voice in a re-
markable way. Temple Harrison has the low
comedy as a Jack-tar. His full-flavored jests
about tattoo-marks and the privileges of matri-
mony make the audience roar; but there is a
line here and there that wants blue-pencilling
promptly.
After Anderson, prices have rebounded to
the normal for “The Waltz Dream,” and Nikki
Roberts is temporarily deserting Florence Young
for the bier-garten and Fanny Dango. who con-
trives to be quite pathetic when parting from
him. As in “The Yeoman of the Guard,” a
touch of something serious and remotely ap-
proaching real life, strengthens a comic opera
immensely. At the Tivoli, the Wille Brothers
have continued to build themselves into unstable
structures reaching to the roof ; and the front
stalls feel uneasy. The Exhibition, with its
frequent concerts, has closed its doors at last;
and Sacco-Homan, brilliantly stage managed
the end, has been disinterred from his glass house,
and has taken his first meal (caterer, ale and soda-
water all carefully advertised) in the presence of
an admiring crowd.
AT POVERTY POINT.
An exported Australian song-stress of particular in-
terest to Victorians returns here for touring purposes in
August. Mary Conly it is. She was coining into notice
as a young soprano at the time when the 19-year-old
Amy Castles burst into boom, and there were many
people in the musical business who declared that the
Conly voice was quite as boomworthy as the Castles
ditto. As a matter of fact, it was then, and probably it
still is, the bigger voice of the two ; but it lacked some
of the brightness of the rival soprano. Besides, Mary
Conly, stout and matronly in figure, looked years older
than her age, whilst Amy Castles at that time was a slim
damsel in a short frock, with her hair hanging down her
back. Mary’s chance of going to Europe with a few
thousand pounds to her credit was practically nil. No-
body would have given twopence for it. She hadn’t “the
luck to be boomed,” her friends said. But luck came to
her all the same. She bought a ticket in Tatt.'s sweep,
or her fianci bought it for her, and it drew, so the story
says, first prize, or second, or third. Whereupon the
joyful couple got married and went to Europe. In due
course Mary Conly made a good start as a concert singer
in England. She was engaged later on for the soprano
solos in oratorio performances, and now she is coming
back to her native land as a warbler who has made a
name abroad. Naturally she intends to open the tour in
Melbourne, where she was farewelled some years ago.
“0.K.”: Old reminiscencers will be able to bathe
themselves in a flood of inaccuracies when Oscar Asche
returns to Melbourne. He is going to start his “ fare-
well ” season with “The Honeymoon.” Asche has always
been keen on the idea of staging this old comedy in up-to-
date style, and now is his chance. Nobody of reasonable
age has any recollection of “ The Honeymoon ” having
been played in Melbourne, but doubtless it was
sandwiched between a two-act tragedy and a roaring
farce in the glorious days of G. V. Brooke, when the
curtain used to rise at 6.30 and fall from sheer exhaustion
some time after midnight. “The Honeymoon” must
have been a favorite play half a century ago ; grey-haired
people remember rumors to that effect. Written by
J. Tobin in 1804, and described nowadays as an old Spanish
comedy, “ The Honeymoon ” has much of “The Taming of
the Shrew” and a little of “The Lady of Lyons’’and
“ Much Ado About Nothing” in its composition. A peppery
old gent named Balthazar has three fair daughters, the
eldest of whom, Juliana, marries the Duke of Aranza with
the idea of bossing the domestic show. The Duke
staggers the arrogant lady at the outset of her matri-
monial career by taking her to a wretched cottage and
pretending that he was only a day-laborer in disguise.
When she is tamed by menial duties her husband owns
up to his deception and takes her to his ducal bosom.
Balthazar’s younger daughters, VolantA and Zamora, are
courted by Count Montalban and Signor Rinaldo, or
Rolando. Rolando rails against women, like Benedick,
and apologises for his infatuation for Zamora by declaring
that she’s an angel, not a lady. The other fellow tries to
palm himself off as a father-confessor, and is brought to
confusion by his best girl, Volants aforesaid. In its old-
fashioned way “The Honeymoon ” is bright and ingenious.
And it is full of love story, anyhow.
“Floater”: My Parisian correspondent tells me that
Madame Calv 6 has never married, and probably never
intends to change her name. She is supposed to have
had one or two tiny skirmishes with Cupid—mere out-
post engagements—but is said never to have reached
the stage of expensive trousseaux and serious intentions.
True, it was reported in Paris some months ago that she
was to acquire a husband, whereby some thousands of
aspirants for her hand were filled with violent grief and
disappointment. I do not know the name of the lucky
man—possibly it was Mons. Harris—but he was described
in a Parisian paper as “ mi mystirieuxrnilliardaire, quasi-
merit aveugle ,” which, I presume, is Parisian for bosker.

Owen, leader of the Besses o’ th’ Barn band, is a com-
poser who employs music for the revelation of some
singular themes. Recently in Auckland his band played
his new march, “ Pelorus Jack,” which is dedicated to
Maoriland’s notorious fi«h. The piece, which is said to
have considerable beauty, describes in flashes of sound
the approach of the steamer in the French Pass, the
appearance of the fish, and its final departure to its home
in the pale seaweed. The composition is a .series of tone-
pictures after the Wagnerian tradition. Wiegand, the
Sydney city organist, was thelast well-known expositor of
it in these parts; his most famous production in that
manner was “ The Sausage Gavotte,” dedicated to the
pork butcher who had given the big Belgian so much
trouble in the City Council. But in that case there was
no approach of a steamer to illustrate—only the approach
of a dog, and eventually the final splutter of the small-
goods in the frying-pan.
NEVER NEGLECT A BAD COLD.
ISever allow a cold to run its course. Too often
its course is towards pneumonia. The first action
when yon have a cold should be to relieve the
lungs. This is best accomplished by the free use
of Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. This medicine
liquifies the tough mucus and opens the secretions.
A complete cure soon follows.*
The story of “ The Arcadians ” is not so wildly impos-
sible, after all. In the Clarke-Meynell show a trio of
strangers from Arcadia are persuaded to serve as chief
attractions at the new Arcadian Restaurant in London,
where Simple Life refreshments are sold at fancy prices.
One of them is a mortal named Smith, renamed Slmph-
citas. In a history of the Masters of Music we are
told that Handel, whilst in Naples (in 1710, or there-
abouts), was admitted to “ a dilettante aesthetic society
called ‘ Arcadia,’ in which persons of high rank dropped
their rank and became ‘ shepherds and shepherdesses ’
with simple names. They gave entertainments for
Handel, they admired his music, and decided that he
was a true Arcadian shepherd. There were two ‘ shep-
herdesses’ in particular who encouraged him in his work
and suggested ideas for his music. One was a Spanish
Princess —the Princess of Squinzano. Her Arcadian
name was simply • Egeria,’ but her title was well known
and her wealth and position were not to be disguised
under any pastoral simplicity.” Truth is more serious
than comic-opera, but not much less strange. The actual
craze for an Arcadia Society in Naples 200 years ago is
copied, rather than caricatured, in the fiction of a London
Arcadian Restaurant. Handel, hailed ns a true shepherd
and idolised by Egeria and other cranks, was “having
the time of his life,” like Smith Simplicitas when he is
chased up and down Piccadilly by a regiment of girls.
“ Jean S.” : “ 0.K.” (B. 28/4/10) has only touched upon
one phase of the Taits’ dispute with the Melbourne Town
Hall Bumbles. The plundering charge of £5O a night has
been paid by the Taits under the politest protest; but
recently the Town Hall people increased those showmen’s
burdens by a peculiarly arrogant, demand. They claimed
that in hiring the Hall, for Calv 6 presumably, the Taits
should pay for a certain number of nights iri advance, not
at the usual rate of £l5 a night, but on the “ sliding
scale” charge of £6O a night. This demand, which
implied a knowledge of Taits’ prices before the Taits had
published them, was the subject of much ceremonious
correspondence ; but the showmen finally declined to
consider the request in any way. And now the Town
Hall despots are asking £5O for the matinee hire of the
Hall, for which the ordinary charge is just £7 10s. t Is it
avarice, malice or merely stupidity?
“ Barrier ’’: |I note that the always-interesting
“Johanna” in “Melbourne Chatter ”(B. 7/4/10) ventures
the opinion that the players of Scotch parts in Barrie’s
comedy, “ What Every Woman Knows,” are too English.
Well, bettertoo English than too Scotch, say I. “Johanna”
would doubtless be surprised to know that the actors
have to obey a particular injunction of the author’s
(underlined in their parts) to the effect that the charac-
ters are to be played with a slight accent only—not in
Scotch dialect! Barrie’s audiences are not entirely com-
posed of people from the north of the Tweed, and he is
very careful that his dialogue should be understood. For
that reason he, when casting his pieces, hardly ever
selects a Scotsman to play a Scotch part. Take, for in-
stance, the London cast of “ What Every Woman
Knows.” Gerald du' Maurier (John Shand), English, of
French descent; Miss Hilda Trevelyan (Maggie Wylie),
English, very. The three other Scotch parts—the male
Wylies—were played by Hy. Vibart, Sydney Valentine
and Edward Gwenn. Only one of these players (Mr.
Vibart, who played old Wylie) is Scotch. I have before
me the original London cast of “The Little Minister”—
Barrie’s other wholly Scottish play. Not one of
the very Scotch male character-parts in it was
played by a Scotsman—a rather remarkable fact.
Their exponents were Cyril Maude, Brandon Thomas,
Sydney Valentine, Eardley Turner, Holman Clark, Mark
Kinghorne and F. H. Tyler. All English, Kinghorne
alone being of Scottish descent. In spite of these draw-
backs (!) the play was one of the biggest successes the
Haymarket theatre has ever known. I agree with
“ Johanna ” that “ no Englishman can be a Scotchman."
Neither—“ Johanna” will agree with me—can he be a
“ Prooshian,” a Yankee or a Chow ; but if, as an actor of
“ character ” paits, he is called upon to appear as one or
other, he more often than not contrives to give a fairly
convincing representation of the “ dialect part.”
“Ganesha”: Oscar Asche’s craving for stage food
becomes more pronounced as his season progresses.
After eating several consignments of apples during the
run of “ As You Like It,” he is now washing them down
with goblets of wine in “Count Hannibal.” A logical
development of the Asche method suggests great possi-
bilities for the actor of the future, who Will think out his
parts in terms of food and drink. In the beginning, the
part itself, the psychological rendering of character, was
the actor’s chief consideration ; then he thought more of
dressing the part than of its interpretation; now the
actor’s success depends on its suitable feeding. One can
imagine Oscar playing Hamlet as a study in Danish ver-
mouth ; Macbeth, as a moral lesson in Scotch haggis ;
Antony, as an impressive warning of the baneful effects
of oysters and nightingales’ tongues on a martial disposi-
tion ; Romeo, as a delicate impression of olives and
cayenne pepper; Henry the Fifth, as an inspiring exam-
ple of the merits of Shropshire mutton ; and so forth.
Food may become as necessary yet as limelight or wigs.
A tedious speech may go down better with a Manhattan
cocktail, and many a dubious situation may, haply, be
saved by the skilful introduction of a ham sandwich" or a
pork pie. Maeterlinck’s “ Blue Bird ”is full of animated
food ; but Asche is the first to recognise the aesthetic value
of food from the actor’s point of view.
The widow of old “ Billy ” Barlow died at Gvmpie last
week, aged 87. Barlow was a comedian who earned a
large income very easily. His fame, which was mainly
Victorian, is based on a song concerning a Blue-tailed Fly
or Bob-tailed Fly, and he was wont to sing it whilst
seated on a chair and twanging a banjo. If all the
singing comedians who have been funny in the bygone
ages were ranged in a ghostly line and called upon to re-
peat their antique performances, the Spirit of Humor
wouldn’t survive the shock.
“Silas”: La Milo started showing again at the Pavi-
lion, London, to take full advantage of the big advt. her
trial had provided. An Australian in the Dense Fog
writes that the whole damp village wasgrea ly concerned
about its Pansy blossom, and flocked to her show once
more. But Milo had been out of the h inds of that ’cute
showman, Lang, for some time, and had run intem-
perately to flesh, with the result that her Venus and
other rock goddesses were absurdly fat divinities. In
fact, the stones of Venice were about five stone too
numerous in each case.
“Harrison O.” : “Snell” (B. 28/4/’10) mentions that
Miss Grey (of “ The Lion,and the Mouse ’•) savs she “ has
no time for dressing” ; and he adds, “Now, Miss Grey is
no particular class of an actress, and-she cannot afford to
ignore clothes.” From this it would appear that, as the
lady is “ no particular classof an actress,” her one chance
of histrionic salvaiion lies in elaborate frocking. But
elaborate gowning in the case of Shirley Rossmore would
have been theatricalism, pure and simple. Shirley is the
clever daughter of Judge Rossmore, who has been ruined
socially and financially hy Ryder, the American Octopus •
and Miss Grey, to my mind, acted, looked and dressed’
the part almost to perfection. As a matter of fact the
gibe regarding poor dressing has been poked at quite a
number of actresses who have subordinated the sartorial
to the histrionic art. On the other hand, some of tlie
best-dressed mummeresses who have shown themselves
hereabouts—from the volcanic Mord Hilvard to our
own inimitable Miss Duggan—have displayed about as
much partiality for Art as an upright Hebrew does for
pork.
Lament written by an old and hardened actor on be
holding “Chantecler” for the first time
’Twas but the other night, me-seems,
Interpreting a poet’s dreams, •

Hurled clammy eggs upon the boards.
The schemes of progress truly range ;
Still come development and change—
I see, through tears, a later age
Is throwing hens upon the stage !
“ Dryandusty ”: I’m not saying “When Knighthood
was in Flower” isn’t full of—shall we call them idio-
syncra«ies >— but, if “ Johanna ” suggests that the historv-
books will squirm because Mary Tudor marries her Charlie
in the end she is wrong. She didn’t get him as the plav
says she did ; but the history-books say she got hiiii

The “Chantecler” hat certainly draws attention to the
wearer, and, in the minds of many smart-setters, that is
the first virtue of a hat. So that the “ confection ” may
not fail in exciting- interest, the most daring Parisian
ladies are wearing hats that imitate the more musical
notes of the birds represented.— Lady's Letter.
What most in hats do women prize?
We know, in point of fact, if
A head-dress draws the peoples’ eyes
It’s “ really quite attractive ” ;
And so the “ Chantecler ” should tower,
Not stuffed, but live and growing,
And do its wearer proud each hour *
By energetic crowing !

And Mrs. Brown a lively pen
Of magpies roundly cursing.

Dear Bulletin— Ee “Scalpel ” (B. 21/4/’10)
and his alleged “student days.” Either (1) they
never existed, in a medical sense, anyway ; or (2)
they eventuated in the imagination of an Ameri-
can degree shop ; or else (3) they’re such a long
way back that “Scalpel” has forgotten the
things he learned in them. Writers occasion-
;ally make sure of facts before stating them in
their work ; and I hereby challenge “Scalpel ” to
adopt my chloroform method at The Bulletin
■office, and suggest Reid’s Dry Dog as something
'for him to hug if he wants to hug something
before entering the next world. For he’ll enter
iit all right.—Yours, Lillias Gordon.

There has been an outbreak of weird
language lately. The Cardinal has been setting
Bydney hunting to find out what a Wowser is ; in
Melbourne Justice Higgins has been ploughing
nip the queer jargon of ships’ stewards; and in
Adelaide James Gordon, the P.M., has been ex-
tending an already copious vocabulary. “Crook”
and “square dinkum ” came easy to him. A
“ leather ” and a “poke,” “reds’’and a “block”
were all accepted as fair game for a pickpocket.
But the puzzle sentence was—“lf you crust me
I’ll have a stall for it.” “To crust,” it turned
out, is to charge with vagrancy, and “ a stall” is
an excuse. “Stall” seems a good word, anyhow.
One stalls off a trouble; why shouldn’t a stall be
the thing one does it with ?
“SCOTS WHA HAE.”
SUE'S BROTHER: “’ Tain't any use your foxing

Somebody with a well-developed sense of
his own importance ran a harmless-looking little
section into the Motor-car Act when it was being
passed in Victoria last session, and a Ballarat
citizen discovered it the other day and found it
wasn’t quite what it looked. He had held up his
hand and stopped a motor-car to allow his horse
to pass. The ; honker said the stoppage was
“ malicious and without sufficient cause,” and a
subservient honorarium fined the horseman 10s.
and costs. So, in Victoria, it is now even more
dangerous to bend your elbow in the neighbor-
hood of a motor-car than it is to nod your head in
the neighborhood of an auctioneer.
Take one bad cold, one cough, one sneeze,
One roughened gullet, one bad head,
One poor old patient ill in bed.

Which makes you well, acts like a charm.*
In Melbourne the other clay a man was
charged with falsely stamping a couple of ward-
robes, and in dismissing the case two geniuses
showed a weird predilection for absolute accuracy.
The furniture, thrown together by Chinamen, was
stamped “European labor only;” and any ordi-
nary J. Pays would have described the stamps as
naughty falsehoods. Not so these two Solons.
The labels were put on the varnish, and as the
varnish had been splashed on by a white work-
man, the Solons held that, of course, the label
applied to the varnish. Heaven only knows what
unearthly decision they would have arrived at if
the stamps had been found on the unvarnished
wood. Probably in that case they would have
held that the description was more correct than
ever, since it obviously referred only to the labor
that had put on the stamp.

One of the unsweetest little stories ever
told is that of the recent disturbance on Robben
Island. Robben Island, a barren-looking place
with a lighthouse on it, protrudes from the sea
near the coast of Capetown, and is used as a
settlement for S’African lepers. A 64-galloii keg
of rum got washed up on the beach, and the
decaying mortals grabbed the keg before the
warders got wind of the find. Whereupon the
finders soaked their dejection with ardent spirit,
until as many of them as could walk were in-
spired to run amok. The guards quelled the
insurrection and captured the keg without killing
anybody—for, after all, a leper full of rum is more
gruesome than terrible to deal with—but three of
the poor devils managed to drink themselves
dead. What a subject for a series of Norman
Lindsay pictures ! The lepers, the rum and the
riot!

In Melbourne, it is not an easy matter to
deprive a dipso, of his beer. If you get out pro-
hibition orders, as allowed by the Vic. Licensing
Act, you cannot employ the police to serve the
orders without paying 2s. 6d. for each document
served. If you object to such an outrageous
exaction—as you may when 50 to GO drinkeries in
a district have to receive papers—you can take on
the disenchanting task of serving them yourself.
As only the police, as a rule, know every pub
in a district, you will probably miss two
or three, which fact will soon be discovered
by the weak relative who owns the darling sin,
and he will reward all your benevolent diligence
by bending his elbow at each one in turn. The
Law, which might reasonably be expected to pro-
tect a drunkard from himself, is here seen to Vie
practically protecting the boozer from his
friends. In effect, it says : “ Half a crown a pub,
or take your own action,” well knowing that your
own action is likely to be as useful, eventually, as
no action at all.

The Oldest Inhabitant remembers some
more ancient beer-pumps:—
The absentee Coopers are getting rid of their Sydney
properties by degrees. The item now on Die market is
the hotel on the N.E. corner of King and Pitt streets.
Originally the corner and much adjacent land was the
property of Samuel Terry, who died in 1838. On the
corner in the ’thirties there was a drinkerv ; but in the
early ’forties it mended its ways and “went dry.”
Towards the end of the ’forties it backslid and became
the Rose and Crown, kept by William Toogood ; at that
time the intersection was furnished with four pubs, one
on each corner. The mid-’fifties saw the corner once
more piously inclined ; it then became the Bible Hall.
Throughout the 'sixties and up to 18T8 it was an apothe-
caries’ shop, and a very fine one. In that year the old
building was demolished and the present pubberv
erected, the first tenant being Ned Trickett, the cham-
pion sculler, who had gained the title by beating the
stale Sadler on the Thames. Jim Punch was horrified at
Trickett opening in opposition to him (Punch was on the
N.W. corner), for Punch had taken Trickett to England
and made him champion.

The Carlton (Vic.) Court was called upon
to inspect an unusual couple the other day. The
lady, who was meek and
diminutive, applied for main-
tenance from the gentleman,
who was large and indig-
nant. He was her husband,
she said, for she had married
him in a Bourke-street
theatre very late one night
in a hazy past. Still, she
could not remember the
name of the theatre or the
officiating parson, because
she had faced the pro tem.
altar in a state of trance.
Moreover, she could not
produce any marriage cer-
tificate or document of
value, and so, when the
wedding was warmly denied
by her alleged knight, the
Bench hastily decided to
dismiss the case. It might
be mentioned in a post-
script that the gentleman
did admit making the lady
what he discreetly described
as “ a compassionate allow-
ance” ; and that seems just the sort of euphemism
to fit the case.

Time is an unfaithful wench, and the
passions of to-day are the driftwood of to-morrow.
Nothing could prove this better than the decision
of the Wellington (M.L.) City Council to remove
the statue of Queen Victoria from its proud posi-
tion in Post Office Square to an obscure back part
of the city where Flossie is one of the main indus-
tries. Shades of Dick Seddon ! How he quavered
over that statue ! When it was unveiled some
years ago thousands of people gathered around
and sang the Unnatural Anthem, while the
leaders of public opinion snivelled and blew their
red noses on their white handkerchiefs. On the
fringes of the crowd overwrought citizens waved
Union Jacks, and declaimed on the superhuman
virtues of the deceased monarch. And now no
one seems to care whether her memorial is re-
erected on Flossie’s evening beat or broken up to
pave the roadway. Apparently nothing is per-
manent in this world—unless it is Flossie and
Debt.
S. Australia, where every other man who
isn’t a J.P. is a teetotal local preacher, has a
chance to reflect whether Beer is the worst that
can happen to a community. One of the hospitals
in Adelaide the other day received a whole family
on the same errand—the mother (a widow) and
three daughters. Already three little immigrants
have arrived, and the mother and one daughter
had still to be heard from when The Bulletin’s
census was taken.
HIS FIRST HONEYMOON.
THE MISSUS: “ Will yer take and mash up me
’ usthind’s peas, Miss? He's so nervous ’e
can’t hold ’em on ’is knife.”
A convincing study in wifely devotion is
afforded by the trial of Lieut. Hofrichter, the
Austrian army gentleman convicted of an attempt
to poison off a lot of other officers who stood
between him and promotion. While her husband
was accused of nothing worse than attempted
murder, Mrs. Hofrichter protested,her sublime
faith in his innocence; but when he came to be
searchingly cross-examined as to his giddiness,
Mrs. Hofrichter changed her views. ‘‘She is
now,” says thecable, “convinced of his guilt, and
is deeply hurt at the knowledge she has gained of
his intrigues with other women.” Still, if the
indignant matron had the administering of the
Law. she would probably consider that the ends
of justice would be met by the hanging of those
other women.

The S. A us. Divorce Court lias had before
it a case that made even the seasoned Judge
gasp. The record of one Henderson, respondent,
ran as follows :
September, 1905 : Married (at 19).
Februarv, 1906 : Child born.
December, 1906 : Child born to another girl.
Date uncertain : Cleared out to America.
July 25,1909 : Long and loving letter to his wife to join
him in Vancouver and bring the child.
July 26, 1909: Long and loving letter to the other girl
to join him in Vancouver and bring the child.
Both letters were read out in Court, and’s Honor
said warmly that they “display a villainy of
character such as has not been manifested before
me in any Criminal Court.” Still, it is hard to
say. He seems rather to have been a young man
who couldn’t make up his mind. He was evi-
dently willing to look after both families, anyway;
and many a more villainous young man has left
both to look after themselves without having had
half as many adjectives thrown after him.

At Gosford (N.S.W.) one day last week,
a truck on one of Johnson’s stock trains was found
to contain 23 head of cattle, the ordinary capacity
of such trucks being 13 to 15 head. Investigation
showed that some of the luckless beasts were
dead—trampled to death—while others were in an
almost hopeless plight, half of them being un-
able to stand up when the truck was emptied. The
system of trucking stock is one of the hundreds
of railway matters that cry urgently for reform.
The department doesn’t say how many head can
be carried in one truck, because the size of both
trucks and cattle vary, and the result is shameful
overcrowding and suffering. The only safe way
would seem to be to charge a fare for each cow
carried. If the consignor had to do that lie would
be round bright and early to see that his beasts
got plenty of room. The difficulties in the way
are that under those conditions Johnson hasn’t
enough trucks for the peregrinating cows ; and if
he had enough trucks he hasn’t enough railway
room to run them ; and if he had enough railway
it would all crowd into the bottle-neck at Sydney ;
and then everything would be stopped ; and all
the cows would die in their boxes; and the smell
of dead cattle and rotten railway management
would be as 10 plagues in the land.
“Sadly Battling”: The advantage of
being a convicted criminal only dawned upon me
the other day. Thuswise : For months I have
been badly “up against it,” living God knows
how, knocking up a shilling here and there, some-
times enjoying the comparative luxury of a clean
shirt and collar and a shave, anon relapsing into
scrubby dishevelment. As for living, sometimes
a famished “go” at the free lunch in a three-
penny bar, sometimes a walk round and a smoke,
if the “weed” could be raised. As for sleeping-
accommodation,
very rarely the
wild prodigality
of a shilling bed,
generally a
“sprat” doss,
mme often the
Domain. So
have I kept a
stiff upper lip,
lookedeveryone
in the face, and
hungry, soul-
siclc, tired, have
withal refrained
from thieving,
and never lost
faith in the
prospect of ulti-
mate recovery.
Last week,
when things
were looking
their blackest —
it was a wet
day, too —I met
a man I had
known. He was
nattily-dressed,
comfortable, al-
most smug-
looking. He
stopped, not too
eagerly. Many
months ago he,
too, had “hat-
tied it,” I knew
—had starved
and slept out.
But a week of
it settled his
hash. He hadn’t got my staying power. He had
“ sneaked ” something, and was “sent up” fora
few months. Then the Discharged Prisoners’
Aid Society (I think that is the correct name) had
got hold of him. He was a brand plucked from
the burning. He was truly penitent. He recog-
nised the error of his ways. He would seek for
mercy at the only—etc., etc. So they found him
shelter and tucker and work—and there he was !
He lectured me somewhat severely ; exhorted me
to “ straighten up ” ; and finally came out with
sixpence. There is some virtue, it seems, in being
a criminal.

When a rifle team was sent from the Ma
State to Maoriland in February, the council of the
Rifle Association desired that Lieut. Dakin, who
went in command, should be given the temporary
rank of captain. Joe Cook, as Minister for De-
fence, refused the request—there was no
precedent for such a thing. Now a team
is on its way to England, and Major
Paine has gone to boss the show in a social way,
while a common or garden captain will take
charge of the shooting. Major Paine has been
granted “local and temporary ” rank as a Lieut.-
Colonel while he is with the team. Major and
temporary Lieut.-Colonel Paine is a constituent of
Joe Cook’s. Lieut. Dakin was not. Not that
that could make any difference, of course; still
it is a coincidence.

A terrible indictment of Woman’s fashion-
able Hat appeared in Melbourne Herald lately.
An anonymous complainant wrote :
I have not been a regular attendant at church ; but,
last Sunday evening, was induced to attend service in a
suburban chapel. I got a good position in the centre of
tne building, where I had a good view of the pulpit and
consoled myself on that fact, when in came two females.
One, with a hat that would hold half a case of fruit
seated herself exactly in front of me, and, being a fairlv
large size, she totally obscured my view of the minister and
pulpit.. This enormity in front prevented me from seeing
whether a black or white man was preaching, and I was
so annoyed that I don’t go to that place to wc#shin
again. 1
This is where the cherubim and seraphim are ex-
pected to burst into tears :
When Mr. Brown to chapel went
In spirit meek and lowly,
Ilis thoughts were on salvation bent ;
He bowed his head as one who meant
To keep the Sabbath holj'.
For strength to guide his steps aright
Poor Brown was a beseecher,
When lo ! a woman gowned in white,
With hat to match, obsessed his sight
And hid him from the preacher.
In vain he tried to fix his gaze
Upon the shepherd’s features.
The Hat was large in many ways,
Bike those we meet at matindes,
Adorning giddy creatures ;
So poor old Brow'n was thus deterred
God’s grace from truly seeking ;
For though, indeed, he clearly heard
The shepherd dealing out the Word,
He could not “ spot ” him preaching.
He goes not to that chapel more,
He girds at Mrs. Grundy ;
He’ll never reach the Golden Shore,
For now', as worldly as of yore,
He goes for walks on Sunday.
Dark schemes of crime torment his mind,
He dreams of theft and arson
Because, when prayerfully inclined,
A monstrous Hat he sat behind,
And could not see the parson.

“Yitrrum”: I wonder if the prevailing
bach-country objection to hare, rabbit, kangaroo,
wallaby, etc., as food, isn’t really part and
parcel of the importing mania—or first cousin
to it, anyway—the idea being that nothing
you can get handy can be of much account. Once
I was slculldriving 400 miles up-country (N.S. W.),
and boarded with a very poorly-off family. The
ountry around swarmed with rabbits and bares,
but I never saw any of either on the table. There
were 14 youngsters, but not one of them w'ould
have anything but mutton —beef was out of the
question—and it kept the poor old man busy
buying or stealing for them and for me. I didn’t
like it; so one morning I shot a hare and left it
with the missus to jug for my dipper. When I
got home from the seminary, faint and hungry, a
milk-jug, phoclc-a-block with dark, grilled flesh,
was set before me, and the lady explained that
she couldn’t get the whole of ’im in, try as she
would, and the last of the bigger wash-jpgs was
broke. Anyhow, she reckoned that a man as
would tackle the like, jug or no jug, was pot fit to
be a teacher or anything respectable ; an 4 she
told me so. After that I was regarded by the
parents around as a man of no class. I applied
for a removal on the grounds that I was pot con-
sidered decent, and I got it.

“ Bobstay ” : Presence of mind is the
next best virtue to wealth, which reflection occurs
to me when I think of how many ships are lost by
keeping too close in to the Australian coast. Not
a great many years ago the habit of hugging
the coast was equally fashionable ; and
wlien Captain hit the landscape he
knew that, this being his second attempt
to go overland, his ticket was UP. ,11
As he backed her out and cursed
Providence for insisting on scat-
tering coast-lines in the most awk-
ward places, lie spied a small
steamer ahead of him too close in
to the land. A look through the
glass showed him a tug. evi-
dently fishing. From her mast-
h hung a flag or two, evi-
dently lately used in signalling.
The big steamer’s skipper was
almost struck dumb on the
bridge with an inspiration.
Jamming his helm over, he
rang for full speed ahead, and
decorated his signal-halyards
with intimations of his inten-
tions to assist at all hazards.
Running in as close as he dared
with his deep vessel, lie asked,
“Are you in immediate danger?”
and received a laconic “No” in reply.
Backing out again, he hurried to port
with the news that there was a vessel
ashore, that lie could not reach her, and
that her crew were not in immediate danger.
Unfortunately, his vessel had severely damaged
herself in the heroic attempt to save human life.
Soon after, the “ wreck ” steamed into port with
a cargo of fine fish aboard. Captain ’s yarn
was thin, of course; but in those days Marine
Boards were composed of old sea-salts ever ready
to help a shipmate in distress, and the verdict
was a resolution of congratulation on the conduct
of the big vessel’s skipper.

The yarn is told of Father (say) McTavish,
a much -respected priest in up-North Queensland’.
In 11 years the Father had christened no less than
10 babies for Mrs. Doolan, the tenth ceremonv
being performed just before he left fora trip to
Ireland. Twelve months later he landed back
and was proceeding up the street when a cry of
“Father McTavish ” caused him to turn. There
was Mrs. Doolan, with a new-born infant in her
arms. “Oh, Father McTavish, you haven’t seen
my last baby !” “No, madam.” flashed his
ri verence, “ and I never expect to ! ’’

“ D.M. W.” : The other night I noticed an
escape of gas. and looked down from a fifth-storey
Sydney window to see what sort of a show I
would have if a fire broke out. I was quite satis-

straight. This matter of fire-escapes is a thing
they do better in Ward’s patch. In Maoriland

of dodging Sheol even from the top of the tallest

From an old Indian officer :
The violent trouble among' the so-called Lascar crew of
t ie wrecked Satara after they were put on board the
same co.’s Euryalus suggests a danger which so far lias
had little attention. The morning paper lucidly ex-
plains that the fight was between “two castes,” which is
nonsense, since they are all Mohammedans, and know
nothing of caste. The truth is, there are two distinct
races concerned. The demand for colored seamen has,
within the last few years, far exceeded the supply of
genuine Lascars ; and the “ black ” shipping cos., dread-
ing a time when the Lascar would be able to exact some-
thing like white men’s wages, have hit on the expedient
of shipping Zanzibari negroes under the name of “Seedee
boys,” “ sidi ” being throughout Islam the .name for a
negro slave who lias become a true believer. The
genuine Lascar is by no means destitute of his own sense
of race dignity. He may not be a white man, but he is
at least a cut above a nigger, and refuses to be put on an
equality with him. The “ sidis ” are shipped as firemen,
and the Lascars as deck-hands, and they are usually kept
apart; but, the Euryalus being' a trifle crowded, they
were boxed together in the same quarters, with the re-
sult that one is in hospital with a fractured skull, and
another is in the hands of the police awaiting trial. It
suggests the sort of trouble that is likely to happen on
any ‘ black ” ship when the two sections are thrown
tog ether—say, in case of accident.

The Yic. railways have been trying more
experiments. When the new corridor cars were
run on the Castlemaine and Bendigo line lately,
it was discovered that somebody had carelessly
built them so high that, in order to enter them
from the station platforms, passengers had to leap
about 2ft. into the air. The Department immedi-
ately commenced to raise the platforms to cor-
respond with the new cars, which brought the
platforms up towards the level of the windows of
the old cars. And now Tait isn’t sure whether
he ought to build the old cars up or carve the new
ones down. Some day somebody will suggest as
a way out of many difficulties that Mr. Tait is
overworked, and should take a long rest.

“ Pulcetapu ” : Received a joy-thrill the
other day in a side-street, and 1 break off the
story here to draw attention to the fact that there
js more joy in one side-street nnregenerate than
in ninety and nine that need no reg'eneration.
~ * vf,viioinujvil.
Ihis joy that came to me was born of two
Barnum Scouts and a-lady’s bat, or marquee.
The hat or marquee was sailing down the
side street with the lady underneath,
when the wind blew' it off. It fell
on its rim, and careered before the
gale like a vast panic-stricken mush-
room fleeing from a ketchup factory.
Nor could the lady keep pace
with it until, the escapee being
observed by the before-men-
tioned Barnum Scouts, the career-
ing monster was suddenly and
finally stopped. It was then I
discovered the uses of a Barnum
Scout’s pole. The Scouts were
ahead of the lady, travelling in
the same direction as her hat or
upper deck, and, when it sud-
denly and without warning flew
past them, there was a simultaneous
and instinctive bash of two poles.
Without a groan, the hat or mush-
room dropped in its tracks with its
head bashed in. With a yell of rage the
lady arrived; the smaller Barnum
stopped a punch with the end of his nose
and the bigger one turned and bolted for
Oblivion. Revenge stands not upon ceremony.
Like a maddened eat the lady snatched the fallen
Scout’s pole and flew in pursuit. It was no race,
and the lady pledged her all on a cast. With one
vicious swing the pole whistled through the air,
and the thud and the howl reached Heaven a
dead heat. When I looked back for the small
Barnum he was gone, but I saw, red in the sun,
the stain on the fence where he had leaned his
bleeding nose.

Dr. Fiaschi, as fine a surgeon as ever held
a scalpel in Australia, and as brave a man, had an
old scar ripped up painfully the other day.
Thirty-four years ago Fiaschi, then a young
doctor, fell in love with a nursing sister at St.
Vincent’s Hospital and married her. The lady had
taken lifelong vows ; she had married the Church.
Of course there was a commotion ; Fiaschi .had, in
the Church’s eyes, done an unpardonable thing.
And yet it seemed as if he had been pardoned ; for
after St. Vincent’s had opened a pavilion for pay-
ing private patients, the Superior of the nursing
sisterhood invited him to send patients to
the wards. The invitation was even given
by the Superior in Fiaschi’s own house.
Fiaschi looked over the pavilion, saw that all was
right, and sent patients to it. Besides attending
his own patients there, he recommended the place
to other doctors. And then, at a moment when
Fiaschi had more need of sympathy than he
perhaps ever had in all his life—just when his son
had died under most painful circumstances —the
old wound was ripped open : the Superior wrote,
requesting him to withdraw from the hospital on
account of the incident of “long years past.”
Had ’ the authorities refused to ever allow
Fiaschi on the premises, nobody could have
objected. Fiaschi would certainly have been
about the last man in the world to whimper or
complain. But to have invited him in, and then
to have thrust in the knife at the moment when
the man was least able to bear the blow, was the
refinement of cruelty. It seems impossible to
believe that it was a woman’s work—and, above
all, of a woman who lias pledged her life to
charity. Apparently there is one in Australia,
and only one, who can repair the damage, and
that one is Cardinal Moran ; and many a thou-
sand will wait anxiously to see whether he tacitly
approves of a thing like this or whether he is a
large-minded, just man who not only disapproves,
of it but is also courageous enough to say so.
When the wind blows steadily from the
north for several days on end, it makes things
difficult for the occasional windjammer that flaps
up to Sydney Heads for orders; for, unless the
instructions are handed out promptly, the ship is.
liable to be swept southwards down the coast by
a strong three-knot current before the information!
is forthcoming. In February last the Danish,
barque Prinsesse Marie, from Chili, swooped up,
to Sydney’s ocean door and asked for a chart of;
Streaky Bay, in South Australia. There didn’t,
happen to be such a thing available at the Heads;;
so the tug that answered the door rushed up the,
harbor, as a distracted serving-maid scoots up the
hall, to get one from the city. It procured one
all right; but the north wind had been blowing
for several days, and by the time it got back to
the front door, the royal visitor had been dragged
off by the prevailing southerly current. At time
of writing, nothing more had been heard of the
Prinsesse, though ninety days had gone by since
the morning of her disappearance. It begins to
look terribly like a successful case of abduction
by a fast set.

“ Alpar ” : Once Hived between a N.S.W.
policeman and a N.S.W. schoolmaster, and had a
lively time of it. It seems the copper, who was
acting-C.P.S., was allowed £6 a year for dusting
the court-house once a month ; and the skull-
driver had 2s. 6d. a week allowed for sweeping
his schoolroom (36ft. x 20ft.) every school day.
and scrubbing it on Saturday. The poor fellow
complained that he couldn’t get an outsider to do
it for less than double the money ; and he had to
get down to it himself, as his wife was delicate.
I don’t know what the row would be like now, for-
the Wade party has just reduced the cleaning'
money to Is. per v:cck; and the Board of Health,
says all schoolrooms should be “ thoroughly-
cleaned ” every day. Fancy “ thoroughly clean-
ing” a big schoolroom six times a week for a.
whole shilling, and find your own broom ! The
Schooley, however, had the pull on John Dunn in,
one respect—he could keep as many liens as his
yard would jolly well carry ; but Fosbery would
only allow J.D. six, and the inspector looked to
it that he didn’t keep a seventh. I’m not sure
that Johnny was allowed a rooster. I fancy now
that he bad to hire the schoolmaster’s.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
For the ten months of the financial year that
have passed, N.S. Wales has had a revenue of £11,546,718,
which is £238,343 more than it had in the corresponding
five-sixths of the preceding year. For this improvement
the Socialistic enterprises, chiefly the railways, have been
wholly responsible ; these enterprises have brought in
£320,697 more than in the same part of 1908-9. Railways
and tramways between them have realised £280,816
more. Of course this is not all net profit. Expenditure
has increased, no doubt, under two important heads—
interest and working costs. Still there is a good balance
on the right side: —
10 Months. 10 Months.
1908-9. 1909-10.
Total revenue ..£11,308,376 £11,546,719
Total expenditure .. 11,227,119 11,334,618
Surplus .. £81,257 £212,101
That shows a net improvement of £130,844. Out of the
surplus transfers are made to two accounts—the Public
Works Fund and the Closer Settlement Fund. The
Works Fund is, however, largely employed in providing
things which unquestionably ought to be provided out of
revenue. If £50,000 is first shown as a surplus and
then, on being transferred to the Works account, is em-
ployed in repairs, renewals, and non-revenue producing
buildings, etc., the surplus is bogus to the extent of that
£50,000.
Further, far more than the whole of the surplus
is derived from the sale of lands. The proceeds of these
sales are not revenue. Such receipts are derived from
the sale of assets. If this money were deducted from
the revenue, instead of having asurplus even in this extra-
ordinarily prosperous year, N.S.W. would show a
deficit so far of at least half-a-million. Instead of
being used as ordinary revenue, for the payment of
ordinary services, the whole of this money derived from
the sale of assets should be applied to the purchase of
other assets. This is the most elementary principle of
finance. If a private trader did anything else and pulled
up in the Bankruptcy Court, as he would be certain to do
sooner or later, he would stand a very good chance of
being sent up for recklessness, if not positive dishonesty.
A general election is in sight, and the facts of
this matter ought to be well gripped. Certainly,
if the proceeds of land sales were ear-marked
and used (as they should be) either to pay off
existing debt or to provide other permanent and repro-
ductive works, there would be such a gap between the
true revenue and the expenditure that reforms would be
forced upon the Government. Those reforms would neces-
sarily have to take the shape of either increased revenue
or reduced expenditure, or both. The real facts are at
present hidden by a piece of downright dishonesty, and
none the less dishonest because it has been going on for
many years. The time, however, will come when the
truth will have to be faced—when, in short, the lands are
all sold. It is a monstrous fact that, so far, we have sold
about £60,000,000 of land, and have not one stick or stone
to show for it; indeed, we have not enough sticks and
stones to show even for the borrowed money. The flag-
rant dishonesty of past generations is no excuse for con-
tinuing the practice. Merchants are complaining that
some of their goods are pillaged at the wharves.
They would hardly say that, because some of their
goods have been stolen, therefore the pillaging practice
should be continued until the whole shipment has been
stolen.
Meantime, while it continues to grab the pro-
ceeds of land sales, and use them to pay policemen’s
wages and the like, the Wade-Waddell Government is
borrowing all it can to pay for the things which the land-
sales money ought to provide. During the 10
months of this year no less than £2,892,224 of
loan money has been spent—at the rate of nearly
£3,500,000 a year. The Government tries to justify this
on the ground that it can borrow money at ,3J per cent,
and put it into works which yield 4J per cent. Even if it
could do that the return would not be a penny too much,
considering the perishable character of even the best of
the public works, and the patent fact that, by the time a
public work has been worn out, the Government ought
to have accumulated a sinking fund equal to its cost.
But what the average public work can produce just at
present is no criterion of its capacity under average con-
ditions ; for even the most optimistic person must admit
that the present conditions are extraordinarily favorable.
It is the State’s misfortune that it has at its Treasury a
man who, though well-meaning enough, was hunted out
of the same office only a few years ago by his present
colleagues on the charge that he was a hopeless financial
incompetent, and a dangerous one to boot.
The Labor Party has another chance here.
The “ Reform ” party, which came in mainly to carry out
financial reform, has done nothing. It got office on false
pretences. It not only failed to carry out financial
reform, but it perpetrated a confidence trick upon the
people and put back into the Treasury the man whom the
party said should not be trusted there a day longer. The
“ Reform ” party promised to face the State’s financial
problem fairly and squarely ; and it has not even begun
to do so. Business men, the few who take any real
interest in the matter, know this perfectly well. But,
instead of either kicking the Government into action or
kicking it out, they look at what might happen—a Labor
Government—and then they allow their prejudices to tell
them to let the whole thing slide. Honestly, what do
they think of their own patriotism ?

There have not been many of its 61 years in which it has
not been possible to honestly congratulate the A.M.P.
upon its previous 12 months’ work ; and the present isn’t
one of the exceptions to what has become the rule. In
most respects, in fact, the society has done unusually well.
No doubt the wonderful prosperity of Australia has made
things easy in many ways. Business has come in more
readilv; larger policies have been hanging on the trees,
ready" for the canvassers’ plucking ; interest receipts
have" been good ; and the society has been able to trade
off an unusual number of old foreclosed properties. But
there has been another influence at work. For very
many years the great A.M.P. did not have to face much
in the way of very serious competition. There were
other good offices, no doubt, but they did not
strike one eye where the A.M.P. struck 20.
Lately things have been changing: in that re-
spect. Partly by amalgamations, competitors have
been able to make such a show that it is no longer a case
of the A.M.P. first and the rest nowhere. This change
has done the A.M.P. good. It had rested on' its oars too
long. Its expense rate, for instance, was so much better
than other people’s that there was no spur to make the
society go on improving it; and, as a matter of fact,
the rale did not improve as it ought to have done with
advancing age and increasing funds and business. For
the past year there has been an improvement in this
respect. This comparison shows the recent record :
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1900 .. £9 0 5 percent. 1905.. £8 15 6 per cent.
1901 .. 810 0 ~ 1906 .. 817 2 „
1902.. 814 0 „ 1907 .. Sl6 5
1903 .. 817 0 ~ 1908 .. 819 6 „
1904 .. 816 7 ~ 1909 .. 812 11 „
The past year’s, it will be seen, is one of the best
records of the decade. True, the total expenses, as
included in the first table above, have not been used in
making this last comparison; the special “diamond
jubilee bonus” of £8047 paid to officers and staff has not
been included—the comparison seemed fairer with this
special payment left out. Reckoned on premium income
alone, the improvement is only a shade under Bs. per
cent.
Nor has the reduction been accomplished by
shutting down on new business. The latter has gone on
growing, though not very rapidly. Following the prac-
tice adopted here of charging 7 per cent, on renewal pre-
miums and 3 per cent, on annuity business, and regard-
ing the balance of the expenses as the cost of the new
business, these results show up :
Renewal New Ex- New Busi-
Premiums. Premiums. penses. ness Cost.
1877.. £353,345 £33,951 £58,905 99'6 p.c.

1908.. 1,868,208 166,640 285,804 91'9 ~
1909.. 1,944,035 168,972 296,585 88'8 „
Even now the figures are nothing for the A.M.P. to be
very proud of. An office with its tremendous advantages
ought to be getting its business for a good deal less,
especially at a time of great prosperity like the present.
Still the beneficial awakening before alluded to probably
hasn’t yet borne its full fruits. It is to be hoped not, at
any rate.
Along with the improvement in the expense
rate has come another, though a small one, in the interest
earnings, as compared with most of the recent annual
averages:—
Interest Realised on Average Funds.
1900 .. £4 11 10 percent. 1905 .. £4 9 8 per cent
1901 ..4 9 7 „ 1906 .. 4 9 7 ~
1902 .. 4 9 6 „ 1907 .. 4 911 ~
1903 .. 4 810 „ 1908 ..494
1904 ..4 9 0 ~ 1909 .. 4 9 8
Still some of the year’s improvement is more apparent
than real. The funds for the purpose of this calcu-
lation (and the office follows the same practice) include a
reserve for the possible depreciation of securities.
Twelve months ago this reserve stood at £140,509 ; and
though a small amount has, meantime, been transferred
to it, it now stands at only £97,631. This wiping out of
portion of a reserve has, of course, the effect of increasing
the rate of interest shown on the balance. The
amount written off the Depreciation Fund is additional to
what is shown in the table as written off. Incidentally, it
may be mentioned that the revenue account discloses—
“ Surplus on sales of foreclosed properties, etc., £13,541.”
It is always particularly comforting to know that a co.’s
foreclosed properties have brought in more than book
values. But this does riot appear to be a ngt profit. The
large cut into the Depreciation Reserve at any rate
suggests that, if profits have been made on some lines,
larger losses have been disclosed on others.
The total assets, including the Industrial
branch funds (£49,336), now amount to £26,087,089,
less £283,029 of liabilities. These assets are represented
as follows :
1895. 1908. 1909.
Public securities .. £602,007 £5,296,953 £5,642,929
Municipal loans .. 339,489 2,697,667 2,934,977

The growth of public and municipal securities—the
safest that the country can possibly offer—is very grati-
fying. There is still room for growth, though. Mort-
gages, in which more than half of the assets used to be
risked, are now down to 41 per cent. The premises
account is extraordinarily small for an insurance
office, and the smallness of this and the other
property items is one of the best features of
the accounts. Premises only absorb a shade over
1J per cent, of the funds. Policy-holders will see
that in the revenue account “ office rent ” is charged
among the expenses—£ll,43l. The A.M.P.’s practice is
to compute interest at 5 per cent, on the book-value of
the premises, and debit expenses with the difference
between that amount and the amount actually received
from tenants for the rent of portion of the office
premises.
The great society’s surplus for the year was
£894,991, of which £123,500 is put aside for various
contingencies, etc., leaving £771,492 available for
bonuses. This will give the following result in com-
parison with some previous periods

They are very cheerful figures indeed. Yet when The
Bulletin quotes the bonus figures of any office it always
seems necessary to protest against the tendency of the
public to regard bonuses as the one gauge of an office’s
quality. Two other things at least ought to be
considered—(l) Relative premiums charged ; (2) the out-
look for future bonuses. The latter point is governed
chieflv by the quality of the investments, the quality of
the lives assured and of the management generally,
and the stringency of the actuarial valuations.

The profit' for the .year, as set out above, doesn’t agree
with the figures mentioned in the directors’ report; but
things are reconciled this way

It is possible that part of.what is herein referred to as
profit is not true profit, add similarly part of the reserves
may not be the best ki/id of reserves. The Insurance
Fund additions are premiums added to the co.’s own In-
surance Fund ; in other words, by taking some of its
own risks the co. therebj- made a profit on the year of
£3261. But, especially where the business is compara-
tively small, there is no uniformity in insurance results
from year to vear : one or two disasters more or less
make all the difference between a loss and a profit.
Therefore, though a profit may be shown this year, a loss
may be made next year. Still, it seems the right thing'
to show the year’s savings as profit, because if the co.
pleased it could at once end its own risks by paying cur-
rent premiums to somebody else.
The capital and the big reserves—a splendid
accumulation for 28 years’ trading, especially considering
that the capital wasn’t always as big as it is now—are
supplemented by £195,435 of liabilities. These latter are
mainly trading debts, but there are £52,970 of cash
credits, which probably include some deposits. The
£975,218 of capital in the business on March 31 was re-
presented chiefly by merchandise stock, shipping, pre-
mises, and property and book debts. This shows how
various items have moved (figures are as at March 31,
before the appropriations for dividends, etc.): —

There has been a big increase in the shipping item ;
this is no doubt mainly due to the vigorous fight which
the co. is making for the Singapore and East Indies trade,
and the addition of big steamers to that line. Very much
depends on the vigor with which this shipping asset is
written down ; for a co. can stuff profits away by writing
down more severely than the circumstances call for, or
it can inflate profits by neglecting to provide for wear
and tear and bumps and barnacles. 8., P. and Co. is one
of the very few concerns which set out plainly in their
published Profit and Loss account how much they do
write off. As follows :

1910 .. 21,520 21,254 10,581 15,000
Of the £21,520 written off against depreciation the
directors mention in their report that “ the usual £12,000 ”
is written off shipping; and of £21,254 to provide for
sundry losses £8370 was on account of the coal strike.
The extra £15,000 now written off is applied to reduce
the book value of shipping. The co. is full of energy. It
got into the Island field when there was little attraction
there ; and, though it has many a stone thrown at it, its
enterprise deserves more ha’pence than kicks. It is
widely credited (or otherwise) with pursuing the bawbee
hard. But it trades in a region where credit is none too
good, and the collection of debts none too easy. If it
were the other kind of concern it.would probably have
gone bung long ago. It certainly would not have been
in the position to give the genuine Island trader and
wanderer the help that it can and does give. And to its
other risks it has now added the Singapore trade with big
boats. This is a comparatively new and no doubt expen-
sive experiment; and it is too early yet to say how it will
turn out.

An exceedingly fine balance-sheet is presented for the
yeari, The revenue, as shown above, was £1,536,121,
which was £80,608 more than for the previous year ; yet
the compensation paid and provided for, including inci-
dental expenses, amounted to £792,871, or £4165 less than
in the previousyear. Theinterestearnings alone totalled
£68,076 ; and as the paid capital is only £172,308, that
means, so vast are now the reserve accumulations, that if
the co. did not make a farthing out of its insurance busi-
ness it could still pay a 33$ per cent. div. out of interest,
and even then put a pound or two by. The tremendous
jump in the business took place less than 10 years ago,
and was mainly due to the extension of employers’ lia-
bility, especially in England. The co. was on the spot
ready to do that class of business. At first prop'sals
rolled in, and the co. took all sorts of risks. It had very
little data to go on : even it, with a good deal of experi-
ence in accident insurance, didn’t know how often work-
men are battered. The result was that in 1902 it made a
heavy loss. Then it grew wiser, selected its risks, let
the newcomers have those that it had burned its own
’prentice fingers with, and has been coining money ever
since. Besides the reserves shown above it has an invest-
ment reserve and general contingency account. It is
quite possible that that ought to be included among the
reserves. It depends, of course, upon whether the in-
vestments are kept written down. The practice appears
to be to keep all, except premises, in at cost; and
in issuing a complete list of the securities a note is added :
“The above investments, less the investment reserve
and general contingency fund, are in the aggregate fully
of the value stated in the balance-sheet.” Under those
circumstances, this fund is not included with the re-
serves. Though the co. nowadays also does fire busi-
ness, it is not a concern likely to be hit by any; over-
whelming disaster; and, anyhow, it has got into a
position in which some pretty serious mistakes might be
made without causing more than a ripple on the surface.

The matter might be put another way. As at. Dec., 1908,
the paid capital was £602,158, including a few pounds of
then unpaid divs. It is now £541,532. The figures are
squared like this: —

Capital at present £541,532
The accounts don’t make quite clear how this £90,626
of written-off capital was absorbed. We can get this
far :
Written-off tailings dumps, etc £17,374
~ ~ plant, holdings, etc. .. 41,602
~ ~ P. and L. debit balance .. 29,650
Total .. .. £88,626
That leaves £2OOO to account for. Still, from the fore-
going it will be seen that, instead of £29,650 being shown
as written off, the amount might be set at £90,626. But,
as a matter of fact, none of the writing-off was as real a
thing as it might be. The shares were nominally reduced
from 20s. to 165., but they are to carry dividend and
other rights as though they were not reduced. The pro-
cess made the accounts look prettier ; but that is about
aU.
At present only the prefs. get a nibble at the
profits. For a while the whole tiling promised to be a
disaster. The early experiments were a failure, and when
collapse looked highly probable—from the outside, at any
rate —more capital had to be got in. The issue was made
preferential, and even then it was evidently thought
necessary to offer extraordinary terms. First the prefs.
get their £1 per share back ; then they are entitled to 20
per cent, cumulative pref. ; after that they rank with
ordinaries for the purposes of any further distri-
bution of profits. So if, after the prefs. have got
their capital back, there is £75,000 or so avail-
able, the prefs. get 4s. 9d. per share and the ordinaries
9d. As shown above, up to the end of December,
£44,756 had been returned to prefs. ; and, including that
amount, the total to come their way is £179,026. Thus
one-fourth had been paid up to that date.
The Zinc Corporation’s future depends mainly
upon the behavior of the zinc market. The co. does cer-
tainly produce some lead and silver; hut for 84,698 tons
of zinc concentrates dropped into the bins last year, the
total of lead concentrates was only 6411 tons. The stuff
which the co. treats has been already stripped in the
lead mills of the hulk of the lead and silver; what
it gets it recovers from the tailings. To get the zinc
out this co. depends on the Elmore process, followed by
a re-treatment on Wilfley tables; the latter operation,
the general managers report, accounted for £20,749 of
the vear’s net profit. Having to relv so very largely upon
one metal, the co. is not in the same position as a Broken
Hill mining co. If the bottom fell out of the zinc market
the Sulphide Corporation, for instance, would si ill have
its hi"- lead works and output to look to. This Zinc Cor-
poration has all its eggs in one basket; and all the
watching it may bestow on it may not be able some day
to save that basket from a bad accident. At present a
convention is steadying the price ; hut it is impossible to
sav whether that will last or not. While the good market
lasts and while the purchased tailings-dumps last, the
co.’s profits will be very enticing. But the foundations
are none too secure. # #

The co. owns three East Greta and Stan-
ford Merthyr coal mines and the East Greta railway, all
in the Maitland district. It has been a very prosperous
concern and its management has been of the cautious
sort ■ therefore, besides the amounts shown above as
written off, large sums have been charged direct to
profit and loss to cover the rather indefinite item,
“ Depreciation, plant, etc.” In the past half-year
this item has absorbed £3543, so that, exclusive of de-
preciation, plant, etc.,” a small profit was made, in spite
of the strike. The railway may have been responsible for
most of that: it kept running throughout the trouble.
Big improvements have been made by this eo. during the
past five years. As at M <rch, 1905, the mining and rail-
way property, with plant, etc., stood in the books at
£148,587. Now, in spite of large amounts spent out
of profits, nominally or really as a set-off against
depreciation, the corresponding item is £194,254. The
mines must now stand at very little. In 1906 the
East Greta freehold had been written down to £12,611,
and the Stanford Merthyr leasehold (including the Rail-
way Act) to £12,000. Now these assets are all lumped
together, and it is impossible to say how much the mines
stand at in the books. Even if they are in at the old
fio-ures the position is very much stronger than that of
most mining cos. ; for a very small proportion of the
capital is represented by the wasting mining-property
asset. Shareholders have, however, to keep their eye cm
an issue of £28,000 of debentures. It isn’t a big
issue- still, whether there is a boom or a .slump,
a strike or peace, the debenture-holders call for
their interest regularly. To have this cheap money is
pleasant enough in good times ; but in bad times share-
holders realise that it means so much cumulative pref.
capital. Nevertheless, when the eo. finishes spending-
money on its big equipment, the large amounts of profit
usually written off will no doubt be applied to the reduc-
tion of this debt; and the process should not take long,
for on present appearances, all three of the co.’s chief
assets are full of profits. At present, the liabilities (in-
cluding debentures) exceed the more-or-less liquid assets
by £20,786. # #

So, in spite of the st.rike, a trifle of about £72 has been
made during the past half-year. This, however, allows
no writing off for depreciation of either mining property
or plant; in other words, it is assumed that these assets
are worth every penny as much now as they were six
months ago. They may be ; but it is highly improbable.
The co. never has been in a position to do what it
would no doubt be very glad to do; it has never written
anything off either its property or its development ac-
count. Development works—thatistosay, certain holes in
the "round—now stand as an asset worth £15,966. Apart,
therefore, from the capital represented by the mine-
purchase and plant, the coal won has not met expenses
by £15,966 plus £727, or £16,693 in all. The co. has had
a lot of bad luck. It didn’t have enough money to start
with, and, instead of getting the use of some for nothing
temporarily from shareholders, it has nearly always been
in debt to the hank. At present the overdraft is £4530.
Then it had a fire ; and after that it didn t jret all the coal
that it had hopes of getting, having been disappointed in
its search for a seam lower than the one hitherto worked.
So far it has taken out about £170,000 worth of mineral;
and, as mentioned above, besides not gettinganything out
of that output in the shape of dividends, the cost has
amounted to £16,693 in excess of earnings. Certainly the
shaft and the other workings are there, and are available
to reach and get out other coal; but it has been a most

clude those of the A. B. C. Co., Miss Bishop, and a
smaller one at Manly. The price to be paid for these is
£33,500, of which £15,000 is in shares and £18,500 in
cash. The substantial assets (plant, property, etc., but
chiefly plant) are valued at £16,101. This means that
£17,399 is asked for the goodwill of the businesses. The
question is: Can they make enough profit to return,
say, 8 per cent, and put by sufficient to wipe
out the goodwill item in 10 or 12 years? On
that point the only available evidence is a report by
Kent, Brierley and Sully, the well-known auditors, who
say that for the past 3£ years the average annual net
profit has been £4356. This is equal to just under 124 per
cent, on the proposed capital of £35,000. If that profit
can be maintained it is a very desirable thing to get into
at par. But neither this present writer nor anybody else
can say whether that profit will be maintained. All that
can be said is that the habit of eating in cafes is certainly
growing.

The committee appointed to consider an efficient
scheme for coping with fires in Melbourne delivered its
report the other day. The report recommends that ad-
ditional water and much larger mains be supplied to the
city and suburbs ; that no main should be less than four
inches in diameter, and that a 4in. main should be only for
short distances ; that the owners should be required to pro-
vide special appliances for high buildings; that the Board
of Works be ordered to carry out the scheme with money
loaned by the Government, and that it should secure a
fire float, for use on and along the Yarra. The total cost
of the undertaking is estimated at £237,518, on which in-
terest, at 3£ per cent., comes to £8313, and a sinking
fund of 1 per cent, to £2375 —total £10,688. To this
annual charge the committee thinks the Government
should contribute one-fourth, the municipalities inter-
ested one-fourth, and the insurance companies one-half.
The recommendations are sound, though the sinking
fund might well be larger: a fund that will not wipe the
debt out in less than 44 years isn’t emphatic enough con-
sidering the perishable nature of the goods into which it
is proposed to put the money.

Ever since the lode was cut in the shaft at the
South Extended, Broken Hill, a cloud of mystery has
hung over the operations. A great deal was heard of the
intention of the management to put in a crosscut at the
930 ft. level, but .very little work in that direction was
really done. After taking out about 4ft. of quartzite on
the eastern side of the shaft a diamond drill was installed,
and over 300 ft. of country was passed through. Then
the core showed good lode matter —one report
giving it as pure galena—and outsiders at once
concluded that the eastern body now being worked
in the Sulphide Corporation’s Central mine had
been cut. Sqch an idea is, of course, far fetched;
but it seems to be the kind of bait the stock exchanges
want. Whether the ore cut is a permanent lode or only
an isolated vein of little or no value, nobody can tell at
present, so the management is going to explore with a
crosscut. How highly the management thinks of its
chances may be gathered from the fact that a contract
has been lpt for crosscutting east through 333 ft. of
country, with a further 40ft. in lode, and it is to be car-
ried Bft. x tjft. throughout. The cost will probably be
about £4 10s. per foot. The crosscut will be an un-
usually large one for an undeveloped mine, and it will
need something pretty silvery at the end to justify the
expense.

The “scarcity of miners” racket is at times
used by Broken Hill managers as a bluff to keep the
public eye off a hole in the administration’s coat. At the
Junction North, for instance, there is likely to be a
shortage of miners as long as there are hell-hot stopes to
work in ; and as long, also, as the irregularities of the shaft
continue to give men the jumps when they are being
hauled up and down. But the most humorous example
of the “scarcity of miners” bluff was put up on the
Broken Hill Warden the other day. Some months ago a
syndicate pegged out an old mining block near
the South Extended, and immediately offered it
on the English market. The syndicate hadn’t a
chance of doing any work on tfle block itself, but was
hoping to sell to the Britisher. The mining laws of this
State don’t recognise any contingency of that kind, but
say that when a man pegs out a block for mining pur-
poses he must do some mining on it. Unfortunately, the
British capital the syndicate was waiting for didn’t arrive
as soon as was expected, and the syndicate found itself in
a hole. So it went to the Warden with a story about the
scarcity of miners, and was actually granted a suspension
of labor conditions for several months.
The English-owned Mt. Boppy (N.S.W.) paid
27£ per cent, on its capital for last year. That means ss.
6d. per share, ora total of £33,275. Yet the mine only
gives an average extraction of Bdwt. sgr., worth about
345.; but. as the costs are only a few pence over a guinea,
a profit of 13s. per ton is left. Altogether, 70,334 tons
were treated, and the reserves amount to 226,500 tons,
or three years’ supply. There are few mines that give
the ore, secondary products and residues a more scientific
and elaborate treatment. A model of the treatment
works is one of the exhibits in the Sydney Geological
Museum, and is well worth study.
* * * *
Kangiara (N.S.W.) lately installed a Nissen
“ independent circular discharge ” stamp battery , which
is getting the good word that travels the long distance.
At a very small expenditure of power, these Nissens are
in various places putting through eight tons per stamp
per day of stuff crushed to go through a 900-hole screen ;
and, because of it, the owners of many low-grade pro-
positions begin to see light ahead. N. Guthridge, Ltd.,
send The Bulletin a pamphlet describing what the thill
is and what it is doing in other parts.
* * * *
Harden (N.S.W.) directors put it plainly, as
usual: “ The failure to develop payable ore in the bottom
level is causing considerable anxiety, especially as it is
becoming difficult to keep the mill supplied from the
stopes above No. 4 level.” A dive is therefore to be
made into the good ore that is showing underfoot at one
place in' No. 4. But, though No. 5 level has failed to find
payable ore, the fact that the lode lives at No. 5 certainly
justifies the thorough exploration of a No. 6Jevel.
Many of the good things at Wyalong (N.S.W.)
have been discovered through the agency of tributors,
and there are hopes still. Four parties in the True Blue,
working between the 800 ft. and 900 ft. levels, have just
treated in the aggregate 73 tons for a satisfactory 2060 z.
gold, besides tailings and concentrates.
Yerranderie silver mines (N.S.W.) are located
n a patch of porphyry backed up by broken sandstone
and conglomerate. Most of the loading conies into
Camden, 42 miles from the field, the carriage being £2 a
ton, or nearly Is. per ton per mile. That, of course, is a
heavy charge ; so Yerranderie is anxious for railway con-
nection with the main line. This little silver-field has
prospered in a moderate way during the last few years.
Its output for 1909 was 6650 tons, valued at £99,374.
The silver alone was worth £71,926. The ore contains an
average of about 108 oz. of the white metal, which grade
is obtained by a rough system of picking. For 1908 the
shipments were 7402 tons, containing 528,1290 z. of silver.
That made the stuff worth about £ll per ton. The
average value of lead is from 20 to 25 per cent., and of
gold 3dwt. to 4dwt. The Yerranderie mine (originally
known as Hilder’s) sends away about one-third of the
total output of the field. Its shaft is down BSoft., and
for the last 80ft. the width of the vein has varied from
Bin. to 15in. There doesn’t appear to be enough second-
grade ore to keep a concentrator going, though after 12
years’ work there is an accumulation of seconds which
must have attention before long.

Oroya-Brown Hill (W.A.) retires from business
with a very creditable record. Since the co.’s formation
shareholders have received £2,139,750 in dividends;
at the farewell meeting held in London the other day it
was announced that they had got back the original capi-*
tal plus £450,000 in cash and shares —that is, assuming
the scrip turns out to be worth its face value or more.
Included in the profits earned by the co. is an amount of
£lOO,OOO made by “finance,” as distinguished from mining
gains.
* * * *
An “ interesting return in relation to cancelled
gold-mining leases” has been issued in book form by the
W.A. Mines Department. About 1500 areas from which
gold was once won in quantities ranging from an ounce
upwards is brought under the notice of the miningpublic,
and the latter is invited to give some of these abandoned
blocks a further trial, and so make a practical effort to
prop up the State’s falling output.
* * * *
The advent of another process for the treat-
ment of Kanowna pug (W.A.) is announced. In the past
the attempts to make a profit out of this plentiful sub-
stance have been legion, and while some of them seemed
certain to win all the gold in theory, they went bung in
practice. In some cases, however, it was not so much
the fault of the process as the want of gold that brought
about failure, and history has a weary habit of repeating
itself.
* * * *
8., M. and Co. have just acquired a promising
group of leases at Youanme (W.A.) on behalf of the
Oroya-Brown Hill and Oroya-Black Range cos. So far a
shoot of ore from oft. to 18ft. wide, and worth 455. to
85s. per ton, has been opened up near the surface, and
the workings at 200 ft. indicate the continuance of this
satisfactory state of affairs. The question of working the
property jointly, or forming a separate co. to do so, and
dividing the stock, is now being considered by the new
owners.
* * * *
Peak Hill Goldfield, Ltd. (W. A.), just manages
nowadays to pay its way on the treatment of ore and
accumulated residues. This struggle is expected to be
continued for a few months longer, when in all proba-
bility the debenture-holders, who also have most of the
scrip, will take over the property' and try to get some of
their money back again. Their chances are poor.
* * * *
Bellevue (W.A.) has been granted a year’s
exemption from labor conditions. The application was
supported by a declaration showing that for every 24
of the 211 acres held £4OOO had been spent independent
of the value of the gold won, which a recent estimate
gave as £524,111. The co. has struggled long and wearily
to get the best of refractory-ore deposits, but the outlook
is as dark now as ever it was.
* * * *
Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) has been inquir-
ing about the price of a shake-down in 8., M. and Co.’s
stable ; and in all probability satisfactory arrangements
will be made for its lodging before long. Meanwhile
references are being exchanged, and the usual investiga-
tions as to character and respectability are being made
on both sides.
* * * *
W. J. Loring turned up in Westralia, the
other day, after 15 months’jaunt to London, Canada,
West Africa and Burma. He will put in a few 7 weeks
buzzing about 8., M. & Co.’s mines at Kalgoorlie and
beyond, and will then follow suit in the other States and
Maoriland. After that he flies off again.
* * * *
New Brilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, has
declared a shilling dividend (£7500); and this and a
report of good boundary developments on the Mills’
United side caused the market to rally. The returns
don’t suggest that more than six dividends (£45,000) will
be paid during the year ; so even with shares at 275. the
investor will have a long wait to get his money back. In
Mills’ United No. 13 is shaping better, and the boundary
winze from No. 10 level, which at last report was in for-
mation with mineralised leaders, has made into good
stone. This boundary winze has about 300 ft. to go to
reach No. 13 level, so there is a wide interval between the
two developments. The sinking of two winzes from No,
2 level and the expected developments when No. 3 is
driven east and west are factors that help the gamble in
Freeholds. No. 2 east, which has run into the Brilliant
lease, doesn’t improve, and Brilliant and Brilliant Block
shares have been weak in consequence of the failure to
find a payable reef.
Blucher’s Victory, Charters Towers, had a
boil-over at its general meeting the other night, when
the old directors were thrown out. The cause of the
trouble is the old one of day labor v. contract. The con-
tract crowd won. So presumably the men will now be
invited to cut one another’s throats in the cheerful old
competitive way. *
The start of May saw the opening of the
11-mile branch from Clermont to the Blair Athol coal
areas (Q). This line has figured in many a political
promise for more than a day and a half. Back in the early
times of Peak Downs, Blair Athol coal was used there;
but it had to be teamed. Now, with raihthe fuel has a
chance of travelling further. A railway contract for
12,000 tons, to be delivered in three years, has been got
by one of the Blair Athol shows. The contract price is
4s, lOd. delivered in trucks, which doesn’t leave much
for anyone to get fat on.
Bluff Colliery Co. (Central Queensland) added
another half-year to its little lot the other day. Though
the show comes up with no dividend to offer, its coal
turnover increased a trifle and its orders exceeded its out-
put. But it wants capital. “ Some £2OO ” was spent on
improvements to the coke ovens, but the attempt to
make coke from a non-coking coal didn’t turn up trumps.
The Government was asked for help ; and when this was
not forthcoming, debentures were spoken of. As they
haven’t materialised, the directors mournfully remark
that “ the co. has no option but to improve the mine out
of its profits,” and the coke ovens take a spell pending
further £ s. d.
* * * *
Apparently Lawn Hills, in the Gulf Country
(Q.), hasn’t yet been given up as a hopeless job. As
Kidston is in the railway-building humor, there may be
hopes that he will help to bridge the 120 miles between
Burketown and the field. Anyway, veteran Captain
John Warren (he was 71 last week) has been sent up to
add one more to the pile of reports that have been made
on the properties.
The Cloncurry-Elliott (Q.) railway is now
opened to goods traffic as far as Hampden, and the rails
are laid some three or four miles on the Elliott side. This
brings it within about 15 or 16 miles of Elliott, and good
progress is still being made. The Hampden Company
hopes to erect smelters at Malbon, 26 miles on the Cion-
curry side, and run a line of railway from there to the
Duchess mine. The ore from both mines can then be
treated by the one plant. There will be about 40 miles
of railway to put down between Malbon and the Duchess.
Telegraph offices have been established and opened at
Hampden and Mt. Elliott; but, instead of calling the
offices by the old names, Mt. Elliott has disappeared, and
we have “Selwyn,” and Hampden has become “Freize-
land.’’
* * * *
Gt. Fitzroy (Queensland), which has been down
in the dumps on account of the low grade of the ore
proved in the bottom level, has been “ bucked up ” by a
find of an entirely new make of pyritic ore of a payable
grade. This will assist the smelting campaign recently
started. The co.’s profits are still uncertain ;so far they
have been calculated on experimental results only, and
at the Fitzroy there are many things that may go wrong.
* * * *
Kangaroo, Berringa (Vic.), is not to be allowed
to fizzle out just yet, and shareholders are to be asked to
put up money to sink a new main shaft because it is
now “recognised that if this important work were
undertaken not only would the junction of the Kangaroo
and western lodes be met with, but also the golden
shoots of stone that have been worked in both the Birth-
day Tunnel and Williams Fancy would be intersected.”
It is only proposed to sink 200 ft. or 300 ft., and to justify
this little expense the prospects of meeting an intersec-
tion of two reefs should be quite enough without men-
tioning the continuation of “golden shoots of stone.”
Shareholders must, however, be wondering why past
managers did not do this small amount of work when
plenty of money was available out of profits. But pros-
pects have a habit of growing better in a mine which has
closed down or is threatened with that disaster.
*'*■**
Cathcart (Vic.) shareholders whobought at £6l2s.
are getting little comfort from the mine manager’s reports
nowadays. Six months ago these were all telegraphed
down from Ararat, with the results of trial washings
giving ounces to the fathom : but the panelling, not-
withstanding all the searching of miners, never seems to
give much more than 20dwt., and expenses don’t come to
much less—they are over 15dwt. anyway. Shares are
now hovering about 155., and holders, instead of being
buoyed up with sensational yields and trayloads of nuggets
exposed in jewellers’ shop windows, have to be content
with reports like the following : “ No. 3 branch : Last 16ft.
wash running level with back of drive; prospects payable
and good sample gold. No. 13 rise N. intermediate :
Wash rose suddenly; going above back of drive ; pros-
pects showed little gold, good sample. No. 10 rise : Good
progress being made putting N. drive in working order.”
This is the sort of report the public has been getting for
the last few months. From them it can only be assumed
that the ground is bumpy and that the dish showed
prospects of payable gold. What “ payable ” really
means is left to the imagination, which is not too opti-
mistic at present. Getting the drives in working order is
a business at Cathcart which makes mining as difficult as
it is expensive. The saving part of every report is that
the gold in all drives is of “good sample.” This must be
something satisfactory, for it is mentioned so^often.
Minister Mcßride, at Walhalla, said that, be in-
tended that Victoria should be freed of the Newcastle
coal lords, and fed with Powlett coal at 14s. instead of
with N. S. Wales’ at 28s. In reply, out comes mining
man Rowe with the statement that it can’t be done.
Well, time will tell. With a seam 6ft thick, and with the
coal easy to mine, with decent conditions attracting
good men, it is almost certain that it can be done. Any-
how, Mcßride is getting plenty of encouragement to go
on and try, for Victoria doesn’t want to pay 28s. if it can
get the goods for 14s. or even 20s.

Hercules (Tas.) has applied for a “noxious
area” at Williamsford; so it is evidently going ahead
with the works to treat zinc ore by Horwood’s process.
The Hercules is capable of producing from 600 to 700 tons
of zinc ore per month, and recent developments make it
probable that a larger output could be obtained.

Word conies from Mandalay that the Lake
View has a chance of getting back a bit of the cash
already lavished on the Burma Mines and Railways Co.
About 1000 tons of pig lead are now being shipped each
month, and with the aid of a third blast furnace this out-
put is expected to be doubled within 60 days from now.
The smelting works are located at Mandalay Shote, 218
miles from the mines. Fifty-one miles of this distance
are covered by the co.’s own line, and the remainder of
the journey is made over another concern’s rails. Apart
from the prehistoric dumps of slag awaiting treatment,
the co. is hopeful of unearthing ore in the old under-
ground workings.

The Tropics are always furnishing something
hot. Not long since Captain Miles reckoned up
£33,000,000 in the Tongkah, and in gratitude wound up
with a platypus rug for the King of Siam. Then there
was the Tanami, in Australia’s own north-west. More
recently the word has been sent round of a lead-lined,
silver-topped outcrop in Arnheim’s Land, somewhere
near the Roper River. With the froth off the Mount
Balfour floats, and the need of something new to play
with, there was a rush for shares in the new mining
pot. Outcrops so big that they won’t go into
an 80-acre section are talked about, and there are
assays as pretty as those of the covellite and chalcopyrite
which Andy Kelly used to mention in connection with
the Balfour finds. There is also a drover in the story,
to remind one of how John Godkin dropped on to
Hampden for William Orr and Knox. However, no
reason exists why, in the big expanse of the N.T., vendor
Brown and prospector Bradstreet should not have got a
big outcrop plus good samples. But there are so many
mining gravestones in the N.T. that, before getting excited
about it, it may be just as well to wait until an inde-
pendent mining man puts the foot-rule wonder.
The flint stones used at first in the ball roller
mills at Broken Hill and elsewhere were brought from
the beaches of volcanic Iceland. A few months ago
similar flints were found to lie in vast quantities on the
beaches near Mount Gambier’s old volcanoes (S.A.). A
small local co. was formed, and for the past few months
quantities of the flints have been carted to Burrungull
station on the Beachport line, and sent up to the Hill.
As the Iceland stone is usually brought out as ballast and
landed at Port Pirie, the long train freight is against the
local stone. Still, as often happens, the local supply
brought down the price of the foreign goods ; and it
doesn’t look as if there will be any profits in the business
until the Federal Government drops on a duty.

Evidently having an idea that its hold on Aus-
tralia is none too secure, the Colonial Sugar Co. has
taken big works in hand in Fiji, where it can get all the
yellow and the brindle labor it wants. One new tram-
way line is to be between 60 and SO miles long, and it is
reckoned that it will open up sugar country most of the
way. * * * *

From “ Australafrican ”: Solid work is making
Rhodesia, and a boom is possible this year. French and
English capital is responsible for the spurt. Picked
shows are bringing anything from £lO,OOO to £150,000 in
cash andshares. Reefs are as numerous as galena lodes and
outcrops were around Zeehan, the schist formations being
the best and safest for richness and permanence. It is an
ideal poor man’s country for dollying and crushing, and
it abounds in chances for the prospector with from £5O to
£2OO. One drawback is the fever in the low-lying parts ;
but that spectre goes off duty from June to December,
and the hills are free of it all the year round. Mining
laws are excellent; the license costs 205., and for that
yau are allowed to peg out 10 claims, 1500 ft. x 600 ft.,
plus all deeps. This holds good for six months’ dummy-
ing. The way to El Dorado is by boat to Durban or
Bei'ra, then train to the fields. There are no plums for
artisans or laborers, but diggers have good chances.
Four Tasmanians have what look like payable shows—

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Boiler Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of

special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further

The erection of the new 300-ton Blast Smelting
Furnace for the Great Fitzroy mine, Q., is now rapidly
approaching completion at the mine. The dimensions of
this furnace are as follows —168 in. x Him, and 24ft.
high to feed floor. It is water jacketed from top to
bottom. These jackets are made of steel plates flanged
in one piece. The furnace was designed by the mine
superintendent, and has many features of excellence and
novelty in the detail of its construction. The jackets are
made interchangeable, only one type and size of jacket
being used ; and they will further be constructed so that
they are reversible from top to bottom—thus practically
the life of the jackets is doubled. This furnace, as well as
the previous one, was built at the works of the Austral

An interesting report on the Kemp-Welch
River Rubber Estates, New Guinea, made by Mr. A. J.
Boyd, of the Department of Agriculture, Brisbane, for Mr.
Warren Clark, of Melbourne, has been sent to us:—Oneof
the first companies to start rubber cultivation in New
Guinea was the Kemp-Welch River Rubber Estates. This
company originally held 2500 acres; but a few months
back 1500 acres of this land was floated off into the New
Guinea Rubber Estates. The Kemp-Welch company now
has 200 acres planted with Para rubber out of an area of
1000 acres held, and, according to the report of Mr. Gors
(the manager), the 26,000 trees planted, ranging from 15
months to two years’ old, are looking well and showing
vigorous growth. The company has just issued 5000 new
shares’of £1 each, making 20,000 shares in all. The Board
has given instructions to the manager to at once clear
and plant an additional 250 acres with rubber and cocoa-
nut trees. One important feature about the situation of
the company’s plantation is the number of native villages
in the vicinity, as the manager states all the labor
required is readily recruited therefrom.;*

Mine managers when requiring air compressors
either belt, steam, or electrically driven, should not fail
to inspect the Reavell Air Compressor, when they will be
impressed by its simplicity, compactness and portability.
Owing to the working parts being entirely enclosed it can
be placed to work on any part of the mine, either on the
surface or underground. The number of repeat orders
which Messrs. Reavell have received, from the mining

Due to mechanical construction The Mephan
Ferguson spiral riveted pipe is from 30 to 50 per cent,
stronger, gauge for gauge, than any other riveted pipe.
It is also the lightest and cheapest pipe in the market for
all purposes, which is evidenced by its general use by all
the foremost engineers, contractors, mining and manu-
facturing interests. Prospective purchasers of pipes may
learn the many different uses for which spiral riveted
pipe is especially adapted by consulting Mephan Ferguson,

“Cicfc”: Whither has the South Coast
(N.S.W.) bandicoot trekked? He used to be a
frequent feature of the local scrubscape, and he
did something considerable too in the way of
potato, corn and other crop-lifting to remind folks
of his existence. And now he is no more. Un-
like the kangaroo! rat of the Upper Murray
regions, the bandy didn’t wait until brer rabbit
happened along to do his get, but vanished sur-
reptitiously late one dark night, and his arrival
elsewhere has so far not been reported. During
NEGLECTFUL.
"What d’yer think of y’r new lodger, Mrs.
Jones? ”
"Not much; ’e ’asn’t even tried ter kiss me yet.”
his sojourn on the sea border, his bacon, which
something resembles sucking pig, was adjudged
good eating. His nest consisted of grass, bark
and other soft bush stuffs, and was mostly built
well up in a hollow log. Burrows he apparently
knew nought of, and, as his pace was poor, he
was easily captured. However, all things con-
sidered, anyone restoring him to his old seaside
haunts will go strictly unrewarded.
FEARFUL THOUGHT.
HENRY (horror-stricken):
“ I ’ad a most dread-
ful experience last
night , George I
dreamt I give up
drinkin' beer for ever."
GEORGE: “ A dream
ain’t nothink to
worry about."
HENRY : “ Ain’t it,
though? Dreams
has been known to
come true.”
“Jacko”: “J. Pannikin” (B. 5/5/T0),
in reply to “Lad,” talks about bush hospitality,
“J.P.” may think he knows a lot about bush
folk ; but he doesn’t. I remember a few years
ago when he was on duty out beyond Bourke cer-
tain people invited him to dinner. He went, and
no doubt had a very good time. But while he
was having that dinner, the missus of the house
Was refusing a poor old swagman a mouthful,
because she reckoned there were too many tramps
about. It was the first she had seen for months.
One case out of hundreds of the so-called bush
hospitality. Because “J.P.” is who he is, his
fat weskit never gets slack Outback. Therefore
he nearly bursts when anybody mentions that it
is only the fat man who gets the hospitality. I
am game to bet him that I know the nooks and
corners better than he does (I won’t say anything
about loyally serving it—he can have that part of
it), and I think dashed little of the hospitality.
Last year a station manager hunted me out
of an old crib into the pouring rain, and I
had to carry my bike 27 miles on one of tbe worst
roads in Australia. The next night, in Mossgiel,
I heard a man skite about the hospitality of that
particular station. I daresay, if ever I go that
way as Mr. Somebody with a buggy and pair, I
will be invited inside. Another of “J,P.’s”
generous friends once, refused to sell me a bit of
tucker .when I was weather-bound, saying I could
move on or starve. Let “J.P.” go Out-back for
a year or two as a union-shearer or rouseabout,
and then tell us what he thinks of bush hospi-
tality.

“ Edyson Nobody ever said that Archie
M‘Arthur was mad. In all business affairs he
was as dour as the brawest Scot going, and he
could heckle for a bawbee with remarkable astute-
ness. Yet Archie had peculiar views, especially
in the matter of ghosts. M‘Arthur was one of
the oldest settlers about Wallace Town, and a
Bungaree pioneer. He had buried a wife and two
sons off the land, and the spread of settlement was
his great bugbear. He talked of the density of
the population when his nearest neighbor was a
mile off, and in 1888, when I knew him, he said :
“There’s na sense in livin’ in sic a place, there’s na
breathin’ in it. Why, mon, I gi’ ye my wor-rd I
canna keep a ghost.” “A goat?” I said.
“ Na, na, na; a ghost—a veesion. I mind
the time when I had a bonnie wee ghost
in the gum paddock behint the dam. You wudna
want t’ see a mair fearsome ghost, and I
had great pleasure wi’ it; but the busybodies
they startit a reediculous saw-mill at Doyle’s
Hill, and the men made a track by the dam, and
scar’t away my ghost. I have-na seen it these 20
year. Then there was anither yin, a. tall lady
ghost that didna speak, but bided in the back-
yard. She was gude company till, >vi’ one young
feller ’n’ anither callin’ t’ see me daughter Maggie
o’ nights, it got sheer disgustit, ’ii’ quit the place.
I’ve had a matter o’ three ghosts since, but I
couldna keep one more’n 10 months. Old Johnnie
Waters’ ghost bided that long, and went off in a
huff when they put up machinery, at the Bound-
ary mine. The whustle drove him fair daft.
Man, he just hatit it. I was thinkin’ o’ suin’ the
company for damages for the loss o’ Johnnie,
mind ye, but the mine was-na payin’, ’n’T didna
care t’ waste gude money on si<Va meeserable lot.
See here, if ghosts was neegotiable I’d gi’ as
much as 25 sheelin’s for a gude yin this meenit.”
“ Snowy ” : At the South Burnett show
at Kingaroy (Q.) the other day some paspalum
9ft. Bin. long was exhibited. This should, I
fancy, establish a record. If the vegetable goes
much further they will be milling paspalum for
butter boxes, and grazing cattle on white pine
scrub.

“S.S.S.”: In the 40years’ history of Torres
Strait, no white man has had beri-beri, and no
woman; it attacks only the
colored “ boys ” employed in
the pearling fleets. Some
hold Sir Patrick Manson’s
theory that bad rice is
its begettor; others
blame unclean water-
tanks; others, locality.
The Malays, when
afloat, always anchor
some miles off shore,
and never sleep on
deck. They say beri-
beri rises up, like
malaria, in a mist.
Five years ago, the
crews of the fleets
working on the old
grounds were dying in
dozens ; so the hospital
worked up a diet scale
and a line of treatment,
and, where adopted,
these have practically sub-
jugated the insidious sick-
ness. The diet consists of
two parts of flour to one
of rice, with onions, pota-
toes, fresh meat and pump-
kins, and limejuice thrice
daily. While the locale of
pneumonia and enteric is known,
that of beri-beri has not yet been
diagnosed. Some authorities argue
that it is due to a micro-organism in
the duodenum ; others that it is a
form of heart disease; while a third
faction considers it neurotic. Post-
mortem, beyond a fluid-distended pericar- '
dium, reveals nothing. For the wet or sub-
acute cases, which are mostly dropsical and
dyspeptic, a course of dieting, aided by pep-
sine and a high frequency current battery,
gives relief. Dry, cardiac cases linger a little
longer when helped by digitalis and strychnine.
So far as I know there is no record of beriberi
having been entirely eliminated from the system,
and I know of no worse death one can die from.

“Jimmie Pannikin”: I never could
decide whether Outback fishing was a lazy man’s
sport ora wayward person’s penitential perform-
ance. Once at Wilcannia I sat on the banks of
the Darling and watched a local angler for three
hours. At last I strolled down. “Had any
luck?” I asked. “Oh yes,” he replied ; “Iliad
a bite yesterday afternoon.”
“ Puketapu ” : In a little Scotch settle-
ment, at the far end of the South Island of
Maoriland, there were some queer characters, but
Scotty Sinclair and his wife took the haggis.
They both used to go on periodical jags, but never
at the same time, and when it was Scotty’s turn
the town invariably gathered to watch the pro-
ceedings. They (the proceedings) were worth it.
Scotty used to make the rounds of the two pubs
in a shirt, a pair of trousers, and barefooted, and
when he had got fairly primed—which was gener-
ally about 4 o’clock in the evening—his wife
would walk into the pub where he was and
pelt him home with road metal. Selecting a solid
piece of ammunition from the collection in her
apron, she would say, “Wull ye get harne?”
And bash would go the stone for his bare toes.
Long practice had made Scotty an expert, and as
the stone flew he would leap into the air like a
kangaroo, watching carefully as he landed for the
thud of the next. Three pieces of road metal
generally served to drive Scotty into the middle
of the road, where he would be headed for home,
leaping along the dusty way like a cat on hot
cockles. Close behind him came the wife, and
the procession took something of this form :
Wipe: “Are ye for hame, or are ye nut for hame?”
(Bash.)
Scotty : “Aye, A’m for hame.” (Leap.)
Wipe : “ Whut would ye be doin’ without me, Scotty ? ”
(Wallop.)
Scotty: “The De’il kens.” (Leap.)
Wife: “Ye’d be an exhibition to the Lord o’ Hosts.”
(Biff.)
Scotty: “Aye.” (Leap.)
Sometimes Scotty would make a break back to
the pub. and get one, or perhaps a couple of nips
down before “ the puir wumman ” could catch up
and loosen out her battery. Then the perform-
ance would be commenced over again :
Wife : “ A fine sample to the bairns, ye are.” (Pelt.)
Scotty: “Tuts, woman.” (Leap.)
Wife : “ Soppin’ yersel’ with a wheen o’ loozy do-ogs.”
(Crack.)
Scotty Aye.” (Leap.)
I never saw her hit Scotty once. I believe he
could have beaten a bullet in those days. But
age wore him out, and the last time I was in the
little old place Scotty’s leaping days were, over.
I saw him in the dusk one evening being welted
home with the butt-end of a broom.

“ Sfceff Cassander ” : Ever heard of the
Moeraki boulders? Moeraki lies some GO miles
north of Dunedin (M.L.), and the Moeraki
boulders lie along the coast like huge, dark-
skinned oranges with reddish veins running
through them. Great granite things they are—
all round in shape—many of them Bft. to 12ft. in
diameter. Scientific men are baffled as to how
they came there, or where they came from.
Some say, volcanic; others, glacial; others,
meteoric. Personally, I think they were brought
there by whales. Inland from the coast
they are to be found sticking out of some
of the river beds; also, in some of the
paddocks in Hampden, the nearest township.
Once I approached a college-bred Maori for his
theory. “ They are the heads of giants, knocked
off in past great battles,” he said. Asked another
A FUSS ABOUT A TRIFLE.
ANGRY OWNER (to Judge): “Call that a dead
heat? Gor' blime! I won by half a length .”
JUDGE: Half a length! What’s half a length
in a big paddock like this? ”
Maori—a lone fisherman and not college-bred—
and he said : “ Accordin’ to te ol’ Maori, tese are
te heads of te Maori giant—see, no preak te head
in fight.” I concluded he had been primed by
the educated Maori, Some of your contributors
might like them for curiosities. They are easily
obtained. An average cargo steamer will carry
at least five of them.
BACK TO TOWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Old Tom is married, and Dick is dead, and Harry has gone
to the dogs ;
He spends his time husk-hunting now, among the friendly
hogs.
Yet gay it was, two years ago, when we all went wild
’round town,
If we did go back to work next month with our balances
watered down.
Ah, Tom is spliced, and Dick passed out, and a plucky
old sort was Dick ;
He knew the two best nags to back, and he’d never get
drunk on tick.
And Harry—poor Harry is down and damned, he’s joined
the buttoning bunch ;
It’s awful to see a man like him make eyes at thecounter-
lunch 1
Two years—it’s long or it’s just a flash, however your
fortunes go ;
And, long or short, it’s just a span when you strike the
streets you know,
And the shady pubs, where you used to drink, and the
shops where you used to buy
Big stacks of flowers for the Malvern girl—the girl with
the bright grey eye.
Still, the shops are new, and the faces are not the faces
you used to see
In the short, wild weeks you spent in town on your last
gay, gorgeous spree ;
And you don’t see how you’re going to have as good a time
this year,
As in that glorious season when the other three boys
were here !
But yet it’s good to be back in town, and the sun shines
just the same
On the good and the bad and the middling lots, and the
living is worth the game ;
And the beautiful world goes round, whiz-bang ! —and
the siren metropolis sings,
And the Spring we know this time is much the same as
the old, sweet Springs
We used to have ; and the girls are just as beautiful as
they were,
And it’s just as hard as of old to tell the one with the
tied-on hair,
And the winner is just as hard to pick, and the odds are
just as short—
And Tom is married, and Dick is dead, and Harry’s a
broken sport !

STANTON COOK 8 CO., LTD., 23 Underwoood St., off 37 Pitt St., Sydney, So n. s“wa.es for
From Right Out:—
A. W. Canning! who set out from Day Dawn with a
party of 2(j men, two waggons and 40 pack camels, to
open up a stock route through to the Kimberleys (W.A.),
has finished his job. Over 50 wells have been sunk along
the track, and he reckons these will ensure a good
supply of water. Saltbush and natural grasses furnish
feed.
H. Barker, who was in Westralia’s Mines Department
before he went with Canning, was the first back to
civilisation. He says that up to the time of reaching
Hall’s Creek, about 16 months after the start, the party
saw no other white men or signs of civilisation. They
crossed about 500 miles of sandhills and spinifex flats,
sprinkled with numerous, old lake-beds. Then good
country commenced, and it extends right into East Kim-
berley. Barker says : “Approaching Flora Valley and
Sturt Creek stations, we crossed really magnificent
downs, permanently watered and rolling in Mitchell and
Flinders grasses. At the Elvire River we got into rich
tropical country—with palms, bananas, etc., growing'in
profusion.” Yet this is a part of the Commonwealth that
is marked “ Desert ” in the maps that most people carry
about in their heads.
Barker says the Kimberley cattlemen are thoroughly
satisfied that the route will supply requirements, and
two big mobs are said to be already making down to the
goldfields.
The Canning party found that the natives in the desert
are tall and powerfully-built, and appear well fed, although
the principal items on the menu are rats and bandicoots.
They struck the party as being inoffensive and intelli-
gent. According to Barker, they have one unusual
nigger custom—they wear sandals made of the inner
fibres of a sort of mulga.

“Clinker” : A subject of much interest
was dealt with by “ J.G.” (B. 21/4/TO). Admit-
ting that no one will be a cocky if he has brains
enough to be anything else, I think “ J.G. ’’ is still
a trifle severe. Men with large ideas do some-
times drift on the land, though, of course, they
don’t stay there. Smith was one of them. He
came with a pocketful of money and enough ideas
to stock a library. He bought a place which had
a 400-acre, paddock, from which a 20-bushel crop
had just been stripped. He reckoned to plough
the straw under. He did. Or perhaps it would
be more correct to say that, at the expense of,
much profanity and time, he managed to get the
ploughs all over it. Next he tried to harrow' it.
A difficult, not to say impossible, task he found
that. The hoe drill next resolved itself into a very
successful hayrake, and was counted out in the first
round. The disc ditto rode gaily over the top of the
straw and sowed manure and seed on the surface.
As everyone else in the district was burying his
seed in clean ground, the parrots knew that Smith
meant his seed for them. Smith, sorely against
all his scientific ideas, decided to poison a few.
By some mishap, he managed to poison a flock of
turkeys, the pride of his wife. The row that
ensued convinced Smith that a city life would be
more serene. I hear a rumor that he is now a
successful contributor on agricultural topics to
many papers.
“Whaffor”: Instead of preparing to re-
sume the large pastoral areas on the Barkly table-
land, with a view to closer settlement (for which
it is eminently suitable), the S. Aus. Government
has extended the 42-year leases for another 16
years, and has actually reduced the rent. Avon
Downs, w’hich was taken up 26 years ago by’ the
Guthrie family, has still 32 years to run. Tlie
area measures 2500 square miles, and the annual
rental is £202. This is the pick of the tableland,
50 miles from Camooweal. Rocklaiids, which is;
partly in Queensland, pays the ridiculous rent of
Is. 6d. a mile in the Territory, and 7s. 6d. in
Queensland. An area of 36,000 square miles in-
cludes Brunette, 7000 square miles; Alexandria,
10,000 ; Cress well, 1000 ; Lake Nash, Heddingley
and Austral Downs, 1000 A good deal of this is
held by Kidman, and is unstoeked. The
Barkly, with its 17in. regular rainfall, is
superior to any way-back Queensland coun-
try ; yet the land is allowed to be held
by men who have never seen it at little
better than a peppercorn rental. The N.T.
tableland alone would carry about 15,000,000
sheep, and should make an ideal Government Re-
mount Dep6t, besides breeding the best cattle in
Australia. Some sort of agriculture could also
be carried on there. Instead we find 90,000 great
cattle, 5000 horses, and about 50,000 weary jum-
bucks on a tract of country half the size of Vic-
toria. It simply screeches to someone to come and
make better use of it.
If you’d only go and get it,
Take a dose and fairly let it •
Ease your throat, and thoroughly wet it—
Then you’d feel secure.
For it is a splendid tonic
If your cold'be bad or chronic ;
It acts with speed quite telephonic—

RESOLVED TO KEEP IT DARK.
SYMPATHETIC PARTY : ”It’s a shame the way your wife knocks you about.
DAMAGED PARTY: “’ Sh! I wouldn’t ’ave the neighbors know it for the world."
“Machete”: Mention of the Messalina
of Russell (Rossel ?) Island (B. 31/3/TO) calls to
mind my first meeting with the only lady-
policeman I have ever known. She dwelt in a
small village half-way on the road between the
Gira and Yodda goldfields. Visiting miners
spoke highly of the lady’s success in supplying
carriers from her village and district. I found
her to be skinny and unattractive. She had,
however, a small, black and brilliant eye that
burnt where it rested. She thanked me for a gift
of tobacco, the while she shouted orders to some
five-and-twenty hulking bucks, who fell over each
other, pulling up taro and pitching tent-flies, etc.
MODERATION IN EVERYTHING.
FRIEND : “ Wot did yer sack ’im for?"
SKINFLINT : "He was costing me a mint o'
money fer soap. I don’t mind a man washin'
his face or even his neck, but when it comes
to soapin’ himself all over, I reckon it s a
shade over th' odds.”
Behind her stood a worried-looking man nervously
handling a palpably-overdone paw-paw. The tail
of her eye caught him and she reached for the
paw-paw.. She was quick, but he was well-
trained, and when the dreadful fruit burst be-
tween his shoulder blades he was 30ft. away and
making time. He was her husband. I appointed
her a village constable on the spot, and thereafter
she wore the uniform and carried the handcuffs.
Much official correspondence ensued as to her
appointment; but she'remained'a copperess—and.
a good one too—until writer departed from the
country. f ... , ' * , ( :

“V.J.”: Though “A.V. : s” Cloncurry
blackfellow (B. 28/4/TO) may have been a bit
of a liar, still, from personal observation, I write
down the Australian nigger as the toughest of the
tough. I have seen a Nor’-West (W.A.) black
after a tribal battle with a goodly portion of a
double-barbed spear broken off in his side, and
more or less gory wounds from clubs, stones and
firesticks decorating other parts of him. Char-
coal rubbed into the wounds kept the flies off, and
was all the attention he received. The spear,
roughly withdrawn, left big splinters, which
caused the flesh to fester horribly. But in a
fortnight the warrior was quite fit, and was
greasing and red- ochring his body, and breath-
ing out slaughter generally, in anticipation of his
next fight.

“The Prooshan”: The best dog I.ever
knew lived out about 30 miles north-west of Mpss
Vale (N.S.W.). He was owned tif- a
selector known as “Figure Nine,”
who also owned a sort of partially-
eclipsed sheep-station. “ Figure
Nine” was often called into
Sutton Forest on business at
the week end, and Banty, the
dog, would invariably accom-
pany him. Taking the letters
and papers on arrival at the
post office at Sutton Forest,
and making them into a
bundle, he used to tie them
round the animal’s neck, point
across the 23 miles of impenetrable,
and say: “Across the mountain,
Banty!” The dog would promptly
take a bee-line for home, and land the
mail-swag safely. If he was told to
“go round the road,” he would do so,
although it was seven miles further. If
his owner wanted a fat sheep for killing,
he just pointed in the right direction
and said: “ Mutton, Banty ! ” arid, in
a quarter of an hour, Banty was back
with a prime sheep. You could show
Banty a jumbuck on the fringe of a 3000
mob of “travellers,” and tell him to bring
you that sheep, and he’d find the identical sheep,
as was often proved by marking the required
mutton’s overcoat beforehand.

“Giddap” : “ J.G.” shows his ignorance
when he says that the cocky burns off stubble at
night for the sake of pyrotechnic display. The
reason of the evening conflagration is quite
different. After knock-off time, and when the
corned beef has been demolished, the farm-hand
tackles the wood-pile to put in the few hours till
breakfast. The boss comes along and says
genially: “Nice calm night, Bill; let’s go and
burn the stubble off the back paddock.” Burning
off is a job that can be done at night; ploughing
sn’t. Let“.T.G.”go out from his scented-soap
selection at Footscray and study the cocky.
LOOKING FOR THE COMET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I rose at four. The morn was very still ;
No rooster crowed. No milkman was about.
I sought the candle on the window-sill
And lit it slowly like a man in doubt.
The flame was yellow and the light it threw
Hardly enabled me to find my clothes.
(From the front window I could see the dew
Wickedly sparkling on a sleeping rose.)
A splash of moonlight on the carpet gleamed;
I thought it was my handkerchief, and tried
To pick it up, so white and fair it seemed.
I found at last the fickle moon had lied.
At last, equipped with polished glasses, I
Went down and slithered sadly up the hall,
Unlocked the door, and found the early sky
Quite blank and blue like a new-painted wall.
One joyous star, high in the waiting east,
Winked gaily as I searched for some faint glow
Of the great Comet. There was not the least
Sign of the thing ! I looked above —below,
And all around. No vestige could I see
Of anything resembling a long tail,
Till the young house-cat sidled up to me
And flourished his in a disgraceful hail.
I stroked him twice. With cattish mirth he shook
And said “ Mee-yow? ” “No, Thomas," I replied,
“ I’m not ‘ just home.’ I have come out to look
For Halley’s comet.” The beast stepped aside,
Put tip his tail, and sauntered o’er the lawn,
Nor deigned to cast a single backward glance ;
His bearing proud expressed his utter scorn,
His rigid tail looked like a proud knight’s lance.
Shiv’ring, I stumbled in and shut the door,
And sought my bed in a half-frozen state ;
Now well content am I to snugly snore
Until the final, ling’ring stroke of Eight.

£774,164,704 ; 1908, £759,826,051. Thus, not only has

lines of it. Might have printed more only the ninth line
hissed so much we thought it might blow up or bite us .
Sun summer days, hours of sweet stillnesses
And chirp of some small insect in the trees
So piping Pan his reed notes siffles soft
Canorous to the stilly glade where lies
Not far to seek but hard in truth to find
Sweet love hid silent in a whisp’ring wood
His love, who lazes through the shrill notes play
Resolved to lie enhidden fast, until
The last long song sound shatters soft away,
D.E.J. : The theme is good, but the verses are not
skilfully enough constructed Roy R. : Herewith two
verses of your old-pipe poem as a horrible warning :
When at times a trifle morbid,
And inspired by you, old friend,
Feeling rather melancholy,
Little soulful things I’ve penned
And joyously submitted,
I’ve been told my ways to mend
Whilst I’m young
And yet unhung.
And oftentimes a quip I’ve heard
That sounded rather well,
And sent it in and had reply—
That gag is ancestrel;
It is the same original joke
With which Cain slew Abel.
’Tis passing hard
This disregard.
. ..The Cocky (Vic.): Another bard twanged the same
gtring before y0u.... J. G. O’D.: After all, it is only an
account of how a prospector dug a hole, and how various
things fell into it and perished miserably G.W.W. : A
remarkably dull story. Its very dullest moment is when,
two policeman and the detective having surprised the
thieves fighting over the stolen property, the detective
speechifies as follows: “Well, gentlemen, I think this
very aptly illustrates the old proverb, ‘ When thieves fall
out honest men come to their own.’” You don’t know
the language of detectives J.W. : Too late. And,
anyhow, too ragged Seebee : The sea verses have some
wrace, but are uneven. The tram poem makes a cheerful

wholly original work... J.11.G.: The verses are mighty

W.F.M?: Sincere bit of homely verse; but it is terribly
jagged and moans too much over the past..... A.T. :
“ Retrospective ” is rough work with a few faint glim-
mers in it. What do you mean by “As ’lections long off

(V.): Much too blood-curdling. Consider this verse :
But down in the depths of a dark, dank wood
That grew at the foot of the fair hill’s base,
A murderer sat gnawing I is food,
With an evil scowl on his evil face.
The murderer evidently sat gnawing his food so that the

It isn’t a bad bush jingle on the whole, but it slumps
badly when it absent-mindedly tries to rhyme “child”

able. ... .G.S.: One verse of your pastoral poem :

Maisie (W.A.): Both fairly-bright fragments ; but they
want more cutting and polishing Ani Gav : Received,

Young R. N. Teece, second son of the
A.M.P.’s general manager, has just cut loose from
the old legal firm of Stephen, Jaques and Stephen;
and that fact sharpens the tongue of Rumor, who
has been saying for some time that the A.M.P.
has a “legal department” in view, with young
Teece as its first head. The idea is said to be to
do in the office, gratis, much of the mortgage work
for which borrowers have hitherto had to pay fees.
SIZING HIM UP.
“ See those giris spottin' me?”
“ Yes! They're been to the Show, and now they're gessin' your weight.”
Premier John Weary’s incredible state-
ment to a recent Melbourne deputation: “No
one believes more strongly than I in a day of
rest! ”
Died the other day J. C. Holmes, M.L.C.,
of Maoriland, one of dead “Digger Dick”
Seddon’s earliest political friends, and one of
those who signed the big fellow’s first Parlia-
mentary nomination paper.
Andrew Faithfull Gibson, who died at
Potts Point, Sydney, a few days back, aged about
76, was born at Tirranna House, Goulburn
(N.S.W.). He was the son of ex-Army Surgeon
Andrew Gibson, and on the mother’s side was
descended from William Faithfull, who in 1791
arrived in Botany Bay as a member of the old
N. S. Wales Corps. On leaving the regiment the
original Faithfull took charge of the stock of
Colonel Foveaux, and when that officer departed,
leaving nothing to the public but the name of a
street, he left Mr. Faithfull some sheep, which
were the foundation of the family fortunes.
Andrew Faithfull Gibson was interested chiefly
in the Goulburn district, where he established the
still-popular Tirranna picnic race-meeting.
Last Saturday Sydney Telegraph unjustly
accused .Rupert Carrington, the golden-mou-
stached old relative of N. S. Wales’ one-time
Governor, of being a knight! It is understood
that, if the infuriated oldster sees a possible
chance to sheet home “malice,” he will set about
suing the sheet for seven millions. There are some
insults that no self-respecting human being can
take lying down.
The widow of Archibald Michie, who
came to .Sydney in 1841 as law reporter to the
Sydney Herald, and became successively leader
of the Bar in Victoria, a prominent politician,
and Agent-General for Victoria, died last week
in a Melbourne suburb, aged 95 years. Michie’s
best remembered Parliamentary achievement was
the passing of the Single Bottle Act, whereby
grocers were enabled to sell a single bottle of
grog—frequently entered up as “tea.” He was
the first chairman of the A.M.P. Society,
appointed on the 15th December, 1848.
The last whistle blew for engineer John
Laing, last week, at Balmain (Sydney). He was
born at Johnstone, Scotland, 89 years ago, and
was one of the men’s delegates during the big
strike of London engineers in 1851. After, the
trouble, some of the men clubbed together and.
brought themselves to Australia, and Laing be-
came manager of an engineering business which
some of them founded in Sydney. In 1862 he
got an appointment with the Wallsend Coal Co.,
and installed the first coal cranes at the port.
After that, he was with P. N. Russell and Mort’s
Dock, and wound up as acting-superintendent of
dredges for the N.S.W. Works Department.
The world moves all right. Here is
Archpriest McKenna, of Geelong, bitterly dis-
appointed with Halley’s comet, and advising his
flock not to turn out of their warm beds to look at
the measley thing. “It is a most miserable,
farcical attempt at a comet,” he says. “I’ve
seen one as big asta gum-tree, but this is a wretched
thing, with a skimpy tail and no noticeable
features.” It is only recently that gentlemen of
the cloth have dared to speak disparagingly of
comets. They have hitherto mostly devoted their
efforts to dissuading comets from their obvious
intention of running us down.
There are some battlers in the N.S.W.
Education Department. Twenty-odd years ago
a youngster named Lynch started to squeeze
knowledge into the little Australian at way-out
Brewarrina. Incidentally, he pushed himself
along step by step, till about four years or so ago
they made him headmaster at Darlinghurst.
That brought him handy to the University at
last; so he taught by day and attended lectures
by night, took his B.A. with double first-class
honors in 1908, and the other morning stepped up
for hisM.A. with first-class honors. Lynch isn’t
the only man like that in the service, either; yet
when they want a man to run a training school
or anything of the sort they post off to some
foreign part—presumably to try to knock the
heart out of the Australian battlers.
From the Oldest Inhabitant :
The oldest resident in Potts Point, once Sydney’s “ ex-
clusive’’part, is now Mr. R. H. Elvy, of the music ware-
house. Among the few there in 1870 were Mrs. McQuade,
of Bomera House ; James Martin, Q. 0., Oiarens; R. P.
Simpson, solicitor; A. Stanger Leathes, who was at
Moncur Lodge; Mrs. Wingate, widow of the Major, at
Percy Lodge ; Joseph Tor, the ancient draper, at Tor
Lbdge ; Jl. F. Hilly, architect, at Campbell Lodge. G. B.
Simpson and R. M. Isaacs, M.L.A., were next-door neigh-
bors. W. S. Friend, the iron merchant, and J. T. Neale,
the wealthy “investor,” were also there. Dangar’s castle
was not then built; the Ohallis property was stiil
bush ; and vacant patches of land were almost as numer-
ous then as Hebrews and boarding-houses are to-day.
W. J. Holding, one of the most ancient of
all dwellers in the western mulga-countrv of
N.S.W., had a funeral a few days ago. There
wasn’t a man out therb who knew the country
better; off and on he had been doing land-
assessment work for the Government for just on
50 years. Between times, at his place at Went-
worth, he made all sorts of experiments, one
particularly interesting lot being to test the long-
distance vitality of drought-country seeds. He
had germinated some that had been lying in dust
and sand for over 25 years.
Of the new Ministers, Fisher is a miner,
Hughes a barrister, Batchelor an engineer,
Thomas a miner and assayer, Tudor a felt-hatter,
Pearce a carpenter and joiner, O’Malley an insur-
ance drummer, McGregor a builder’s laborer,
Frazer an engine-driven and Findley a printer
and journalist. Fisher and McGregor are Scotch-
men, Hughes a Welshman, Thomas a Cornish-
man; Tudor, Frazer and Findley were born in
Victoria, Batchelor and Pearce in S. Aus., and
King O’Malley in North America. McGregor
(61) is the patriarch; Frazer (30) is the infant.
Fisher is 48.
Tommy Taylor, M.P., of Maoriland, is to
visit Australia in the interests of Cold Tea. In
many ways it is a pity that so good a democrat and
so keen a fighter ever got mixed up with the
Raspberry Vinegar interest. Taylor is both a
worker and a thinker, and in general polities is a
man of considerable ches.t measurement; but once
he gets on to Cold Tea he becomes just an or’nery
little cuss, talking the usual cheap claptrap. If
he could only manage to stay big all the time he
might be the first man in Maoriland. Even as
he is, his visit may cause Australian Bung some
trouble in the dividends.
A KIND OFFICE.
THIS GENT: “ You'll allow , me to pass, porter
I merely wish to assist the lady in with her
hat.”
The notification that B.R. Wise has been
admitted as “a barrister and solicitor” in .Vic-
toria recalls the fights th'at have taken place in
N.S.W. for the amalgamation of the two bri-
gades. In N.S.W. the brigades were originally
one; but soon after the Charter of Justice was
granted Chief Justice Forbes drew up a rule of
court dividing them. So much bitter feeling was,
however, excited that the rule was not enforced
until Judge Burton’s time. The solicitors
struggled hard, but in the end capitulated. Cer-
tain modifications have been introduced—allowing
a barrister or solicitor of a certain standing
to slip out of his own and into the other's ranks—
but the rule enforced by Burton still holds.
James Berry, who died at Morphett Yale
(S.A.) last week, aged 86, was a meenister
straight out of a Crockett story. In charge of the
same country church from 1853 to 1904, he never
allowed an organ, and stuck to the old Scottish
“ paraphrases.” As a young man, he had seen the
great Presbyterian “ disruption ” pf 1845 in Edin-
burgh, and in 1858 he had one all on his own
account. His kirk session had judged a case of
discipline, and he refused to send on the sinner to
be dealt with by the Presbytery in Adelaide ; so
that body solemnly deposed Berry for “con-
tumacy and rebellion.” His only answer was to
stand up in his! own little church and call on each
of his judges, by name, to appear before his
Maker and decide the question. Then the whole
tea-cup storm was quietly ignored by all parties.
Went North last week, to manage the
Tatlocks Soraki tin mines in the Malay States,
one Arthur Thomas, who for a young man has
done and seen a few things. He began his work-
ing life in the Vie. Public Service in 1886, left
that after a few years, designed and built the
Wurruk Bridge, near Sale, for the Vic. Govern-
ment, was assistant-engineer on the Coolgardie
water-scheme (W.A.), then carried out’big irriga-
tion works in Malaya with an army of 2000 coolies,
got hack to Australia and dredging .(mostly for
tin), and finally last year was rushed off to the
Malay to pick up tin properties with a view to
working them. And still he is a mild-mannered
young man, and Frosty Phraser probably had
him in his eye when he said that Australians were
flaccid.
The proposed memorial to T. Bent was first
mooted at the annual meeting of the Brighton
football club. Snowball, M.L.A., was present,
and his eulogy of the departed politician made the
meeting unable to remember certain matters that
otherwise would hardly have been forgotten ; and
before it had properly recovered, the hat had gone
round and the bulk of the assemblage had com-
mitted itself. After the football club had kicked
off, a number of ill-advised persons requested the
Mayor to convene a meeting. This he did, and a
sorry gathering of about 50 people took place at the
Town Hall, where resolutions were passed, rules
drawn up, and trustees and other officials ap-
pointed to cope with the rush of bullion. Up to
the present a few cheques worth about enough to
pay for a picket fence round the grave have come
to hand ; but Victoria as a whole hasn’t responded
with the glimmer of a response. Bent is dead
all right.
The British ship-
owner is an uncon-
vincing: prevarica-
tor. At the time he
is saying all sorts
of uncomplimentary
things about Aus-
tralian shipping and
labor legislation and
its depressing effect
on British shipping,
he is wildly strug-
gling for a share of
the Australian
trade. The Orient
Co. and the old Fort
line have entirely
rebuilt their fleets.
The Liverpool
White Star people
have put on a crowd
of 12,000 tonners.
The old-fashioned
Aberdeen line is
replacing its arks
with modern ships
like the late lament-
ed Pericles. Th e
Federal - Hou lder-
Shire—a combina-
tion of floating ware-
houses has come
into existence; and
the papers that re-
prove Australia for
treating these ship-
owners so badly are
reporting the build-
ing of more and
larger ships speci-
ally for the meat
and fruit btisiness.
Holt’s Blue Funnel
line has gone largely
into the Australian
trade, and is build-
ing new boats speci-
ally for it. The Clan
line is making fran-
tic efforts to get
into it. The P.
and 0., whose Indian trade is being badly cut
into, is making up for it by absorbing the Blue
Anchor line and butting into the purely local
trade with Miaoriland. And the Tvser line is
getting two ifew boats to chase after Australia s
oppressive legislation. Of course this may be the
British ship-owners’ way of turning the other
cheek to the smiter and heaping coals of fire on
our heads for our outrageous treatment of him ;
but there is a dark suspicion that he is doing it
because he finds it pays.
Tanami goldfield, on the borders of tire
N.T. and Westralia, is pretty difficult to reach,
and two or three men have lost their lives on the
way ; still one woman, Mrs. Gordon, wife of a
miner, has managed to get there.
From the back pew :
“The pioneers of Congregationalism in Victoria ” had a
field day at the Independent Church, Collins-street, last
week. They met for the purpose of telling one another
how old they were and what wonderful things they had
accomplished. As a revelation of patient persistency in
church-going, the meeting had a pathetic interest for
the outside world. Twenty of the company had been
there when the Congregational Union was formed, half-n-
-centur.v ago. The oldest adherent of the tabernacle
in Collins-street—or rather the original tabernacle,
erected on the same site—was a lady who put her
first threepence in the plate in 1840. Her age,
apart from the church, however, was exceeded by
that of a Mr. White, who stated that he was
a nevvchum of 33 when he joined the congregation in
1854. But the most garrulously reminiscent speaker was
Deacon Thwmtes. He started as a regular attendant in
1842, since when he had apparently been qualifying for
the position of historian. “In 1838,” began the deacon,
“ there was a gathering of friends of our denomination
who thought it was time to make an effort to secure a
piece of land upon which to raise a church for the future.”
They,.got going before any of the other denominations,
and were rewarded with a free grant of four city blocks
from Governor Lonsdale. Long years afterwards the
Church’s title to this lot of real estate was challenged in
the law courts, but Deacon Thwaices stepped out of the
past and related the land-grabbing transition in full
detail, so the challengers were defeated with Costs.
HIS MISSION
[For T ii k Buhbtin.]
An Australian abroad writes that the transhipment of
Geo. Reid at Marseilles was a fearful spectacle. George
had to be hoisred into a boat alongside with block and
tackle.— Bulletin, April SI.
M.v principal mission is to advertise the country.—
Geo. lieid recently.
The day we landed George
Hight gay it was to see
Our sailormen convulsed
With fine hilarity.
The sea was running high,
As seas will often run ;
We raised him from the deck—
He weighed just half a ton 1
A score of tars, I ween,
It took to raise the High
Commissioner between
Our faces and the sky.
A while he made eclipse
Between us and the sun ;
A while he spun around,
An animated tun !
With block and tackle stout
His corpus had we tied ;
We fired him at the boat,
But always landed wide.
The Boss, a Man of Sin,
His whiskers wildly tore,
And, as we yelled applause,
In crimson-wise he swore ;
Until a final cheer
That rang from ev’ry throat
Proclaimed the High Commish
Was plumping in the boat:
Upon his noble hack
Full squarely did he land,
And wonderment was wild
On all the Gallic strand,
At sound of us who rent
The welkin with a cheer,
At sight of George who went
Ashore in such a gear.
And when they questioned why
He went in such a guise,
He winked the dexter eye:
“My game is—Advertise ! !”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The row afc some of Deakin’s election
meetings annoyed him ; but a man who at one of
them didn’t speak a word probably hurt him most.
When Alfred spoke on a subject with the voice of
the Fusion, the silent interrupter got up, took off
his coat, turned it inside out, and put it on again.
After he had done it about nine times it was the
Fusionists who made the noise.
As usual, after an election, the Home
Department has found it necessary to remind
several rejected politicians that when their em-
ployers dismiss them their railway passes should
be handed back for the use of their successors.
And none of the offenders are Laborites, for no
Labor member was rejected.
Premier John Weary was very sarcastic
when a deputation waited on him the other day
and asked him for a six-day week for all public
servants. It is understood, in the worst-informed
circles, that Murray’s real objection to the reform
is that he has sternly resolved to toil seven days
a week ; and he has made up his mind that nobody
shall stop him.
Probably the best explanation of J.
Weary’s refusal to attack the Vic. House of Fat
has come from old man Graham, one of Weary’s
Cabinet colleagues. Graham, who holds the port-
folio of Water without the slightest sign of aver-
sion, has remarked that there is no necessity to
oppose a House that is showing a disposition to
come into line. Graham’s delusion is that the
House of Landlords is beginning to see eye to eye
with the Weary Government, whereas the fact is
that the Weary Government is beginning to see
eye to eye with the House of Landlords.
Some of these new-fangled Acts give Fat
a lot of good exercise. For instance, there is one
big squatter who spreads himself over territory
both in Maoriland and in the south-east of South
Aus. ; and as both the wheat State and “God’s
own country” own a club in the shape of an extra
tax for absentee landlords, this particular squatter
can t squat long, but is kept rushing backwards
and forwards in the endeavor to be in the two
countries at once. So far, he has managed to per-
suade the Law that he has done it, too.
On the northern rivers (N.S.W.) the
Hindu and Kanaka are beginning to have a game
with the Commonwealth’s sugar bounty law. As
soon as the lav/ came in, cocky chased the
black men off his canefield, in order to qualify
for the “ white ” bounty. But, getting work on
the dairy farms or elsewhere, and living on 2Jd.
per day, Soogee soon had enough to pay a deposit
on a farm of his own—or perhaps two or three
clubbed together. A Kanaka also got a farm of
his own. Now they walk around and boss hired
white labor, and, by virtue of that, send in their
claim for the “white” bounty. And they get
it, too !
April 13 has had an amazing effect upon
the Argus, which is now imploring the Victorian
Parliament to hurry through the Murray land-
tax :
Last December an opportunity undoubtedly presented
itself for the enactment of a law which would have pro-
vided the State with revenue.... It would be useless
now to ask who was to blame for Parliament’s failure to
settle the matter when the chance was offered; hut
events have proved how short-sighted were those who
fought for the postponement of the issue.
As it happens, the Argus fought the hardest.
Still, it is quite prepared to give itself a light
kick if thereby it can save its friend, the Fat land-
lord, from a heavy blow. Of course, its idea is to
get in early with some trifling State land-tax and
thus forestall and embarrass the one Parliament
which really means serious business in this matter.
But the old lady is too late. The ’bus has gone.
Speaker Coles (S. A.) has decided to be a
candidate for re-election to the chair, wherefore
the local Fusion is breathing threatenings and
slaughter against him, because his election will
make it possible for the Labor party, with but 22
members out of 42, to carry its Constitutional Re-
form Bills through the Assembly. Even if Coles
didn’t take the Speakership, Coombe, an old
Chairman of Committees, would. The Fusion
tried to beat him out of Barossa, after throwing
him out of the Ministry to make room for one of
the Butler crowd, and he naturally has no love
for it. So the Labor party feels pretty comfort-
able, though it has so small a majority.
Andrew Fisher will, it is prophesied, be
invited to England soon. Some sort of Imperial
conference will be invented, and when England
lays hold of him Imperialism
will try to curve his spine.
Dibbs was a professed Repub-
lican till his visit to the Im-
perial centre; and his old
pal, Copeland, was the
same till he kissed the
Queen’s hand and
clanked a sword up
the royal stair-case.
Efforts were made to
induce Higinbotham
to go the same way,
but he resisted and
so saved spine cur-
vatu r e. Mcll-
wraith, the once
sturdy Nationalist,
swallowed the bait.
Lilley also, being
regarded as dan-
gerous, was invited
to visit, and for a
while wobbled, but
pulled himself straight
again. The game of creat-
ing conferences is a subtle ex-
pedient of the Colonial Office t»
get a personal grip of men whose
influence on Australian opinion may be turned
to Imperial use. The direct purpose of the con-
ference is of little moment; it could, in fact, be
fully achieved by an interchange of cables. But
royalty’s smile or a king’s cigar has so often taken
the starch out of a Nationalist that conferences
have come to rank among the most influential of
“Imperial” agencies.
A reminder of the recently-deceased elec-
tion shindy floated back to Sydney on the wings
of the first winter blizzard last week. It was in
the form of the prosecution of Sammy Lees (the
reject of East Sydney) and another on a charge of
printing, on March 28, a certain paper, entitled
“ The Labor Party and Socialism,” and omitting
to publish the name of the printer and the place
of publication, as required by the Act. The coy
Samuel—he who didn’t mind circulating tarra-
diddles about Labor, but was evidently ashamed
to own to the fact—got off on the technical point
that the proceedings had not been instituted
within the prescribed time.
Every now and again in Maoriland there
is a yell for more loan money to save some historic
spot from destruction. The latest object of envy
is the house in which the famous Treaty of
Waitangi was signed. This house, which was
the actual birthplace of the Dominion, was
the original camp of Busby, the first British
agent in Maoriland ; and it is still in good condi-
tion, the Australian weather-boarding being as
good as the day it was put up. The doors, floors
and ceilings are of English oak and cedar ; while
the floor of the great verandah is of stone flagging
that was dragged from Sydney. It is a fine old
place, and seems likely to be added to the I O U
country’s “permanent and reproductive works.”
AFTER THE ELECTIONS.—THE
CROAKERS.
Horae Minister O’Malley had not been in
office a week before, in calling for tenders for the
machinery for the Commonwealth cordite fac-
tory, he gave effect to the country’s Protective
and his party’s National policy, by stipulating
that all the machinery must be made in Aus-
As he said, “to allow importers’ repre-
sentatives to bid for the work when the intention
was that Australians should get it would merely
be a case of false pretences”; so the importer
wires off to his principal telling him that if he
wants the job he must come to Australia to get it.
It makes a fine contrast with the shufflesome
platitudes of Deakin and Fuller when they were
asked merely to give a preference to Australians,
and it shows how necessary it is to have sympa-
thetic administration in order to get the best out
of even good legislation.
Thus Sydney Telegraph concerning the
appointment of Colonel Kirkpatrick as Inspector-
General of the Australian Defence Forces
Mr. Fisher’s administration is bound by a salutary
rule of Parliamentary government to carry through the
appointment made by its predecessor.
It is a pity the Telegraph’s memory is so bad, or
it might have recollected that “salutary rule”
before. It certainly had a chance to do so.
Before the former Fisher Government left office
it appointed Defence Minister Pearce to attend
the Imperial Conference. Pearce had his gripsack
packed ready to take the first steamer, when the
Fusion Government came along, cancelled
Pearce’s appointment—which was an excellent
one—and gave the job to its colleague, Foxton, and
hurrayed him off to London in one act. And the
Telegraph’s memory was so bad that it never
once thought to say a word about the salutary
rule of Parliamentary government which binds
an administration to carry through the appoint-
ment of its predecessor.
As one result of the rejection of the 25-
bob fraud, there is, it seems, to be another Pre-
miers’ Conference, at which Wade has announced
his intention of telling Fisher that 255. is not
enough. But, when it comes to the point, Wade
will probably learn something. It is now openly
admitted that Deakin was originally opposed to
the Financial Agreement as drawn up, but affably
yielded to Wade and Waddell on their assurance
that on their advice N.S.W. would carry the
referendum by a thumping majority. Wade’s
political promissory-note having been dishonored
by the electors, Fisher may hint to him that his
(Wade’s) opinion of what is necessary doesn’t
appear to be the State’s.
HE GOT IT.
CUSTOMER : “ I see there is no tipping allowed
here, waiter !”
WAITER (confidentially); “Not aloud, mum.
But we often hears whispers.”
The only members of the S.A. Labor
party who have held Ministerial office are J. V.
O’Loghlin, who was for four years Chief See. in
the Kingston Government (1895-1899), and F. W.
Coneybeer and F. S. Wallis, who were in
the Price Government for a few months, but
pulled out when Peake succeeded to the Premier-
ship. O’Loghlin is the only one of the three who has
held office while Parliament has been in session.
When Price became Premier in 1905 only one of
the members of his Cabinet had previously sat in a
Ministry, yet he got through all right. Indeed, the
one experienced man was by far the weakest
member of the team. For a while Price was at
sea in regard to the forms of the House, but
Speaker Coles pulled him through. That is one
reason why the Labor party is now asking Coles
to retain his office, although, if so inclined, the
party could give one of its own men the handsome
job.
State Premier Murray’s folly in truckling
to the 16 Tories of his State’s Assembly, especially
as regards the land-tax, promises to supply Oppo-
sition-leader Prendergast with a fine battle-cry
for the next elections. Weary has lost his chance
of challenging the obstructive Fats, and their
previous record makes it certain that they will
find fresh excuses for spitting out the obnoxious
land-tax, even though it will next session be
sugar-coated to please them. If Prendergast then
goes to the electors with the abolition of the
House of Fatmen as his principal plank, he is
pretty sure to come back with a majority nearly
equal to Fisher’s. But he will have a harder row
to hoe than the Federal leader, inasmuch as the
Fatmen will have to be dealt with. Still, the
fight Prendergast put up during the Federal
elections shows that he can do things when he has
the mind to.
Willie Watt, the Yic. State Treasurer,
and Labor-leader Prendergast have lately carried
on a short dialogue somewhat as follows :
Prendergast: I am astonished that the Ministerial
Conference should have adjourned for a week when the.
Legislative Council elections are pending. In' the
Assembly last session Mr. Watt was a fire-eater in respect
to the Council. Where is the fire-eating Mr. Watt now?
Watt: Mr. Prendergast’s head has swollen since the
Federal elections.
Prendergast : With due respect to him and his office, I
ask Mr. Watt to leave my head out of the question, and
say when he and his Government are going to redeem
their promise to stump the country to get an Upper
House more in conformity with the wishes of the great
bulk of the electors.
Watt: There is one constitutional way in which an
Opposition leader can obtain information from Ministers,
and that is to wait till Parliament meets and then give
notice.
Watt evidently fancies he is playing Talleyrand
to John Murray’s Napoleon.
“Boswell”: With greetings to Australia,
and the hope that it will be proud of its Yassberra
capital when it gets that nightmare, I submit the
following extracts from two letters recently re-
ceived from my dad’s daughter, residing on the
edge of the Yassberra site. The writer of these
epistles is the wife of a grazier. She knows little
of politics, calls a Wadeite the “Reform ” candi-
date, has doubts about the future of the marriage
tie, and can’t fathom the mystery of the Senate :
27/3/’lO. Ido wish we could get some of the rain you
are having on the North Coast. It seems odd that one
place should get so much and another none at all. Since
New Year we have only had two falls, a little over an
inch each time, and when there was a little shoot in the
grass the early frosts browned it off. The dust storms
occur nearly every day, and we are driving our stock
miles to water. The loss of our hay (by fire) has been a
great blow to us, as we can’t afford to buy hay to feed so
many head of stock.
25/4/10. I wish we had a few inches of your rain.
What lovely grass you must have ! We have sent all our
big cattle away to-day but two milking cows. Jack has
gone with them to a paddock we rented at the Googongs.
We only had aligta rain last week, less than half an inch.
I would rather the mud you speak of than our dust
Bunny is having a bad time about here. The skins are
up to a shilling a pound at the door, and boy is a
trapper. I hope the skins rise to two, as that means a
way of keeping bunny down, and, besides, other works are
at a standstill.
What a fine entry it will make in the geography
books of the future: “Yassberra, capital of the
Commonwealth of Australia. Principal indus-
tries : Law-making, rabbit-trapping, and water-
carting.”
They may talk of King's and Kaisers,
And of Shahs and Princes too,
Of the men who sit in Parliament,
As they often do.
But let me tell you in a word
That while this very world endures
Woods’ Great Peppermint Cure for Coughs and Colds
Will be the King of Cures.*
John Murray is going to do something at
last. His Government is about to start a State
chicken farm at Burnley (Vio.), and, among other
things, experts will there grapple with the
problem of how to keep egg-eating hens from eat-
ing their own eggs :
John Murray bids for high renown.
“By order,” measures will be tried
Towards the end of putting down
The evils of race-suicide.
Murray was satirically sympathetic when
a deputation the other day asked him to arrange
things so that all State servants might have one
day off in the seven. He would do it if he had
the money—could the deputation tell him where
it was to come from ? The deputation didn’t tell
him; it knew that Murray has been told a
hundred times and then hasn’t moved a hand.
However, in case he has forgotten, The Bulletin
reminds him that for a start he can abolish (1)
the useless and expensive House of Fat Land-
lords and (2) the useless and more expensive State
Governor and his establishment.
Bigjohn’s Bunbury (W.A.) paper had a
violent attack of the almost-extinct ’Groper fever
after the election results were out. The horrible
Labor majorities on the goldfields were the cause
of it:—
The flotsam and jetsam of Victoria are dominating
politics. .. . The Gold-stealing Commission and the
present agitation to suppress gambling have given ample
evidence of the stamp of citizen which the miner and
axeman are. .. . Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, the resting
places of the nomad and the adventurer, have, by a blind
and fatuous vote of the Victorian gipsies, been the means
of placing Messrs. Henderson, Buzacott and De Largie at
the top of the poll. When one comes to think how this
State has found the Victorian work and a home, food and
water, the base ingratitude of the easterner becomes all
the more apparent.
It is shocking when you come to think of it.
These wretched ’tothersiders came, and found
gold, and dug it up, and turned Perth from a
sleepy township into a city, and jumped up the
profits of the Gropers’ Westralian Bank from
£ll,OOO in 1890 to £55,000 a year at present, and
shifted other things along at the same rate; and
now the ungrateful wretches, having forced pros-
perity and dividends on the Groper population,
and settled some of their lands and introduced
new farming methods, actually won’t vote for
Bigjohn and the other pushing fellows who were
responsible for the whirling progress that char-
acterised YVestralia before the ’tothersiders
arrived. It is ingratitude.
Do you know that croup can be prevented ?
Give Chamberberlain’s Cough Remedy as soon as
the child becomes hoarse, or even after the croupy
cough appears, and it will prevent the attack. It
is a certain cure for croup and has never been
known to fail.*

STRICKEN WITH
ST. VITUS DUNCE.
School Girl Fed and Attended
to Like a Baby* How
She Recovered*
The school teacher was the first to notice that
Josephine Mortola was developing St. Vitus’
dance. Her hands used to twitch at writing
lessons and soon the teacher had to tell her that
she had better stay away from school. Then
followed months of terrible agony and suspense to
her parents. Nothing seemed to relieve the com-
plaint until Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills were tried,
and they speedily wrought a marvellous cure.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are recommended for St.
Vitus’dance because the complaint is a nervous
one and through their blood making qualities they
supply the nerves with nourishment. The con-
dition of the nerves of course depends on the state
of the blood. Miss Mortola is now a strong,
healthy girl, living with her parents, Hallam
Street, Tennyson, Port Pirie. She made the
following statement to a reporter
’“I was going to school when I got St. Vitus’
dance. The twitching was confined to my hands
and feet, but they were always in motion. I
could not control them. My mother would have
to get up perhaps two or three times in the night
and make my bed, as the clothes would be twitched
off on to the floor. I could not lift a cup of tea
without spilling it. When I lifted my hands they
would go in any direction but the right one, and
mother had often to feed me. I had great trouble
in dressing myself. I was advised to get as much
fresh air as I could ; but I wouldn’t go into town,
I would think everyone was looking at my hands,
they jerked so violently. I actually bit my
tongue right through once, and it was sore for
weeks. My appetite fell away; I would fancy
something and as soon as I would get it I would
turn away and wouldn’t touch it.' My feet didn’t
trouble me when walking, but if I was sitting 1
couldn’t keep them still. My head always seemed
to be aching, and I was so low-spirited I never
cared what happened. If I took up a book I
simply couldn’t hold it steady enough to read the
lines. I wasn’t able to help about the house, and
only wanted to rest. Everything or every noise
got on my nerves. The tonics I took did me no
good, and I began to fall away in every respect.
If I sat for long I’d be tired, and if I stood it was
just the same till I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.
Mr. Sylvia had been cured of Sciatica by them,
and advised their use. Six boxes practically
cured me, and toned my nerves up completely.
My health ever since has been of the best.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are 2s. 9d. a box, six
boxes 15s. 3d., of all dealers, or from the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia, Ltd.,
Sydney.*

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sthnet, Mat 10, 1910.
Mr Dear Artist, —
A city hastily draping itself in black and sad
purple; falling rain ; bunting drearily half-
masted ; closed doors at all the shows—these
things made Saturday memorable. The late King
was truly popular even in places which he had
not visited. He won the Derby, and his most
fervent wish was that everybody should shake
hands and be friends with everybody else. This
is what the public memory will hold longest con-
cerning Ed. VII. Concerning George, we all
have the recollection of nine years ago. He was
mostly hidden under a large busby and concealed
inside uniforms of sorts ; but if he had only come
out from under his hat we could have seen more
of him, and have been able to say more definitel)'
how we liked him.
Duchess May (will she be Queen May, for
short?) loomed larger in the vision. She was
pre-eminently wide-awake. Any public man act-
ing as showman she bombarded with questions.
When anybody approached the dais to be pre-
sented, the business-like Duchess stepped forward
briskly, and her large blue eyes had a calm gaze
that took in every detail. ' Faintly bored, one
remembers her as looking ; but royalty must be a
terrifically boresome billet. At functions the
Duke used to pairoff with Lady Hopetoun, the
Duchess with the Gov.-Gen. Mum was the
word with the former pair, but Lord Hopetoun
and Victoria May kept up a brisk chat. The
new Queen will play the part for all it is worth,
and enjoy it likewise. Royalty permanently on
the premises would be too trying for the Aus-
tralian public. Nobody can sit down when
royalty stands. There were times when the
Duchess of York, on her Australian visit, appar-
ently forgot what chairs were for. All minor
beings wilted after a while and yearned for a
verandah post to lean against, but May of York
stood like a statue for hours. Royalties are
taught that when young. To stand stock still
and do and say nothing is the apex of a roval
training.
One of the saddest circumstances in connection
with the sad event will ensue a month hence when
“our own correspondents” will get in their fine
work in the papers. This is the kind of thing we
shall then be reading :
The King is dead. Yes, really dead. Well, he was a
true sport; not one of your present-dav imitations, but
the real thing. The last time I saw His Maj. he said,
“ Well, Emily, where are the girls of the Old Brigade V ”
“Ah, where, indeed, your Maj. ?” said I. Well do I re-
member the time when H.R.H. (as he then was) came up
to Islington to see us all, and went behind. Supper ?
Why, what do you take me for? Of course,
supper. Here is the m@nu. “ Chops and chips, bitter
beer. Stout and oysters. Calves’ feet jelly, a small
Bass. Tripe and onions. Chitterlings.” Ah ! ever tasted
chitterlings from Noodle’s in the Strand? Yes, those
were the days. We all dropped ice down H.R.H.’s back.
Then all home. No taxis in those days, you know ; but
we all got home somehow. We kept the thing going
then. Still, we did not go quite so far as Lady Connie
and Maud Allan. No, no. We all had clothes. And legs
too —eh, what?
Yes, it’s bound to come.
People who predicted that Australia had seen
the last of our girlish-looking Countess when she
sailed away for her native land last Christmas
must now be ruled out as tipsters, for Lady
Dudley is coming here as swiftly as the Osterley
can bring her. With her aresome more of the Gov-
General’s family—his brother Cyril and wife, a
couple not so very much on! the shady side of 30.
Mrs. Cyril Ward was a Baroness Irene de Some-
thing. Twins are a family habit, for this branch
also possesses twin toddlers, three-year-olds, one of
whom bears the pretty name of Nicolette. Really,
poetic names also run in the Ward family.
Quiet and unobtrusive have been the social
doings of late. “ Waiting for the warships” ex-
presses the attitude of would-be dance-givers, and
charity balls are in the future as yet. Private
parties rarely abound in the absence of the naval
men to keep the ball rolling. The most assertive
society flutter has been the Stage Society’s play,
which was billed for two nights—Thursday and
Friday—at the Standard Theatre. When the
chauffeurs and coachmen had discovered the
locality, which is in darkest Sydney, and had
made their way out again, they felt like success-
ful explorers. Vice-regals graced the show, also
the vivacious wife of our Admiral, and “among
those present ” were those who generally are pre-
sent on such occasions. It was a very moist per-
formance, but that was nobody’s fault, and Miss
Dorothy Grimston explained the fact, whereat
the audience heaved a sigh of relief, glad
to be able to throw the responsibility of
the rain-storm far away from the select few inside
the theatre. Mrs. T. H. Kelly took the part of a
young-looking mother (Mrs, Cassilis) of a grown-
up son, whose engagement to a detrimental
young person is responsible for the title of the
play. It was a very dressy piece, and Mrs.
Kelly’s gowns were quite as effective in making
a good impression as her stage experience, though
not of such long standing. Miss Grimston
was Lady Marchmont, and in the morning
scene she appeared appropriately clad in
innocent pink-and-white muslin, while Mrs.
Cassilis was somewhat gorgeously appa-
relled in a gown of white lace over
silk, and beady toes to her shoes. Lady Chelms-
ford. who has added a zest to society pars, by
bringing some new clothes with her from London,
wore a flowing kind of soft, ivory-satin gown
trimmed with sparkling buttons, and a pink
girdle. Pretty Mrs. Verney(who walks in now
with the Suite always) showed how triumph-
antly a blaok gown sets off youth and freshness.
Talking of blaok gowns, quite the most success-
ful frooking of late seems to be in that mournful,
but deoidedly smart, hue. At the Rankin-
Simpson nuptials on May 4, Mrs. Ewan Fraser,
who has a‘‘lissom figure,” as the penny Pansy
hooks term it, was sheathed in black velvet
(“velvet” in most emphatic letters, please), with
a hat to rave over, of the “ Chapeau de paille”
kind, topped off with black feathers. Then for
the Watisey dance last Friday, Mrs. Corbett, of
Burwood, wife of a bank manager of those parts,
looked as well as anybody in a robe of the same
kind, but cut for evening wear, the sleeves
slashed to the minimum and edged, like the
decolletage (French for low-neck), with jet. Miss
Winifred Gullett, who will leave her mountain
fastness of Wabroonga for Java and other
equatorial parts by the next Dutch boat, is the
proud possessor of a black evening dress thickly
sewn with sequins. (That fashion is in again.)
Such a frock is a bit out of the picture in Java,
where they chiefly wear a sarong and a large and
murderous knife.
Every society wedding in Sydney must have
two adjuncts—a honeymoon at Moonbarra, Port
Hacking, and Mr. H. M. Stephen as best man.
A stereotyped line in all the wedding notices of
those truly “ in it.” runs : “ During the afternoon
the bride and bridegroom left by motor-car for
Moonbarra, Port Hacking, kindly lent by Mr.
and Mrs. Arthur Allen.” And so often has Mr.
H. M. Stephen assisted at the trying ordeal
undergone by so many of his friends that he
knows the wedding service by heart from “Dearly
beloved ” to “amazement,” and can sing “The
Voice that Breathed ” backwards in all keys and
at any tempo. (You can learn any tune back-
wards now by getting it from the Pianolo library
and reversing the roll.) Miss Vera Simpson, who
was married to Mr. Archie Rankin, of Newcastle,
at St. Mary’s Cathedral, on Wednesday, May 4. saw
to it that her wedding had the two things needful.
The bride is the elder daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E.
P. Simpson, of Double Bay. and is a plump and.
pleasing little person, very young to try her hand
at the serious biz. of matrimony. Only one
bridesmaid, her sister Helen, supported her.
The first claim on public attention made by the
bride was at the Women’s Work Exhibition,
wherein she showed some skilful needlework.
Mr. E. P. Simpson marked the wedding-day by
struggling into a frock coat, a garment which he
seldom wears. There were subsequent rejoicings
at St. Mervyn’s, Double Bay. Mr. and Mrs.
Rankin climbed into the motor-car for Port Hack-
ing without tremor, for the unlucky number 13
has long been passed in the catalogue of happy
couples who have honeymooned under the Arthur
Allens’ auspices. Strange to say, the 13th couple
so favored had a pouring-wet wedding day, and
the car that conveyed them to Paradise was after-
wards burnt to a cinder.
Mr. and Mrs. H. Wansey, of Llanthas, one of
the stately homes of Burwood, took the local
School of Arts on Friday for a most uncommonly-
well-done dance, in honor of the first appearance
in the social whirl of their only daughter. With
Miss Wansey five other pretty young things
stepped into society’s limelight for the first time.
A debutante’s set was, of course, fixed up. This
item is worth remembering, for it is seldom that
so many chicks flutter out into full feathers at any
one private party. Then the greenery was most
artistically entwined. There were two tints of
green, and the lamp-shades were all pale green
too. But not on the lower side. Pale pink under-
neath the electrics threw a rosy glow on things.
Mrs. Winsloe Hall (Miss Georgina Delmar)
had a wet night for her concert on Friday ; still
there was a scarcity of empty chairs. The
Y.M.C.A. Hall was the scene of action; the
Habanera, from “Carmen,” the chief item.
Although the deviltry of the song is quite middle 7
aged now, yet it is fresh, and the sentiment
doesn’t look too threadbare when displayed by
such a singer as Georgina. Another pleasant
feature of the evening was the appearance of
Henri Staell, who fiddled to good effect and had
a great show of “ hands ” as a welcome back from
foreign parts. Godfrey Smith played some piano-
forte pieces at the concert, which was really an
“ all-star ” performance. Mr. Hellemann sup-
plied the accompaniments, and the one and only
Southwell managed the show. The singer, with
the big laughing face and good-tempered chatter,
left for Adelaide on Saturday by the Mooltan, of
which her brother, Mr. Cavendish, is purser.
On Wednesday evening, contrary to all prece-
dent, a departing singer, Miss Estelle Mabel
Ward, of the placid smile, gave her swan song at
a farewell feast, instead of at the concert usually
accorded the ambitious artist about to try a
change of climate. The banquet was held at the
Australia. In the big dining-room there was a
long table for the guest of honor, her chairwoman
(Mrs. Geo. Taylor, who engineered the festa) and
others. Smaller tables held six each, seating over
100 altogether. After dinner, songs began in the
drawing-room. Rather a weird time to sing, just
after dinner ! Miss Ward wore pale blue dewdrop
chiffon over gold tissue, with a big golden rose
near her heart. Messrs. George Taylor, Holburn,
Sandford and Laurence Campbell all spoke a
little piece about Miss Ward ; and a substantial
item was the presentation of a purse of sovereigns.
I don’t know how many, were in the purse, but it
felt good and heavy.
Myra Gresty, whose concert was billed for
Wednesday night, in the Town Hall, attempted,
in tackling the “ Magic Flute” aria, a feat which
Steffani says no singer since lima de Murska has
successfully done. The aria contains an Fin alt,
an eminence which it needs an aeroplane to
reach. Ada Colley has done the trick several
times in London music halls, report and Steffani
thus contradicting each other. Now Myra
Gresty does it. That F in alt will become an
Australian product.
This letter will have been soldered down before
the arrival of Calve, but, from advance notices,
her clothes, naturalness and general fascination
have captured Melbourne women, and are likely
to do the same here. Her heralds, the Taits,
arrived last week; Mrs. Nevin Tait (clever Bess
Norris, the miniaturist) did not come over with her
husband, but remained behind in order to crave
just one more sitting from the singer, whose por-
trait Mrs. Tait is painting in little.
Many people who are prematurely grey
do not know that their trouble is curable by the
Hygeia Individual Treatment without using any
stain or dyes. This letter is from quite a young
lady who was going not merely grey but quite
white. She writes, after using the treatment for
only two months :
“ All the new hair is the proper color and the
white hairs have mostly fallen out ; but those
that remain are getting their color back most
noticeably, and the whole of it looks lovely and
bright and glossy. I am, indeed, most pleased
and satisfied.” —Mrs. R., Springsure, Queensland.
Those who wish to know more about this treat-
ment may write, enclosing 3d. stamps for booklet
and many more testimonials, to the President,
Dept. B, Hygeia Limited, Ocean House, Moore
Street, Sydney.*
A correspondent from Maori land, who has heen
to see ‘‘Peter Pan,” with Lizette Parkes in the
name part, says that the brainy girl is doing it
splendidly, having the advantage over Tittell
Brune, who formerly played it, of being really a
child in years.
Another of our “gifted Australians,’’Winnie
Purnell, who went to Germany to learn the
newest in piano-playing, seems to be justifying
her existence. A correspondent writes : “ I have
just returned from Hanover, where I went to
Winnie Purnell’s first concert, given entirely by
herself. The audience stood up and bravoed after
some of her pieces. Her master. Letter, was ex-
tremely proud, and predicts a great future.”
The German enthusiasts speak of Winnie as a
wunderkind, without which tag no juvenile prodigy
is considered hall-marked. They also say (again
as usual) that she is “the image of Beethoven.”
The comparison, though flattering in one way, is
hard on the child, for Ludwig Von B. was “no
beaut.”
Recently farewells were said and presentations
made to Miss Prenter, of the Women’s Patriotic
Club, who is going to England. For her side,
Miss Prenter has worked hard and well, and all
her friends wish her good luck. Although an
out-and-out political woman, the lady is meek and
retiring to the extent of self-effacement. Yet she
made herself felt, and when she had time to com-
pose a political paper, she could talk with the
best. Her best-known time was when the
Women’s Conference was held, about 18 months
ago. At rubbing out little difficulties and pre-
venting little squabbles (which will arise when
women meet together) Miss P. was invaluable.
The death of Mrs. Philip Riley, of Macleay-
street, removes a member of a well-known Sydney
family, the most prominent being A. J. Riley,
erstwhile Mayor. Mrs. Riley had been ill for a
long-time, and was devotedly nursed by her
daughters, of whom one is the pretty Mrs. Kenna,
wife of Dr. Kenna and sister-in-law of Mrs. Geo.
Willoughby. Another daughter. Miss Maud
Riley, wields a weekly pen in a sectarian journal
and is also an artistic fashion-designer.
The Garibaldi jubilee sets folk talking about
the family of the hero. Riciotti Garibaldi, the
general’s son. who was wounded in the campaign
of “the Thousand,” lived for many years in Mel-
bourne, where he held a civil service appointment
and married a Melbourne girl. Their son is now
bossing a section of the Panama Canal works.
One of Garibaldi’s “ Thousand ” —an old gentle-
man named Giles —has resided for many years in
Sydney. He is still an expert carver, but nowa-
days does it in wood.
A recent visitor to Sydney was Mrs. Jenson,
formerly Mrs. Stennett.'of Rose Bay. Mrs. .Ten-
son, who is now in Tasmania, will return to
China next month. About a year ago she packed
up for China as chaperon to a young friend who
was thinking about getting married. But at the
last minute the young lady declined to go, and
the chaperon, not to be baulked of her jaunt, went
off and got married herself.
Arthur Streeton’s father is at present visiting
our harbor city. Old Mr. Streeton is over 80 and
quite hale and hearty. He often hears from his
artist son, who is comfortably settled in London
with a wife, formerly Nora Clinch, the Irish
violinist.
The following item proves that the peg in the
cribbage board of women’s advancement has gone
up several holes. Miss May Bateman has started a
Woman’s Bank in London and has been appointed
its first manager. The place has started with
500 depositors, all women, to whom the kindly
directors allow 2J per cent, for current accounts
and 5 per cent, for fixed deposits. The bank is in
business chiefly for the purpose of assisting its
women customers with advice in small financial
matters as well as with the useful overdraft. Miss
Bateman, who is a writer—and writers are not
supposed to be strong on the multiplication table
—learnt her figures, as a girl af 18, from Sir
Douglas Galton, of the Board of Trade, to whom
she was private secretary. The bank is entirely
staffed by women and girjs. ■
Concerning that daughter of the gods, Nance
O’Neil, who has been getting “30 curtains”
a night for her playing of “The Lily,” David
Belasco, the American manager, has been talking
to an interviewer :
When Miss O’Neil came to me by my invitation I felt
that it was her last chance. I told her frankly that she
had been a star for many years without substantial suc-
cess. I offered her a position in our company, not as a
star, but as one of the players. She was willing to sign a
contract without reading it. If necessary, she would
start again at the bottom of the ladder. She came into
the company merely as a member. She was in earnest.
One day at rehearsal Miss O’Neil and I were going over
and over a certain point in the play. We were sitting,
and finally she got the idea. Then I told her to stand up
and do it. And she didn’t; she missed by a mile. And
the tears came into her eyes, and she punched herself in
the chest and cried, “D n! d n! d——n!”—like
that, three times. And then she got it, and was
rewarded by the biggest round of applause that I have
ever known players to bestow at a rehearsal.
The connection between demnition and despera-
tion is always apparent.
Yours, as of old, Cleo.
All said and done, it seems to have been
about time that some new brains were placed
under the Supreme Court wigs in N. S. Wales.
The Magistrate (Sydney) points out that out of
33 appeals from the Supreme Court to the High
Court the lower horsehairs were held to be wrong
in 22. The original owner of the horsehair, if he
were asked to wag his head “Yes” or “No,”
would, on the law of averages, get a bit closer to
it than that.
A voice from one of the landings
Alexander Gordon, K.C., who steps up from the table
to the N.S.W. Supreme Court Bench, has earned a good
name among the pinched tribe known as barristers’
clerks. These clerks serve as a species of human
bait. To the memo, of a barrister’s fee of £5 ss.
is appended, “ Clerk 2s. 6d ”; if above that and
under 10 guineas, “Clerk 55.” As the fee rises the
clerk’s allowance or tip rises till it reaches £l, and if the
counsel’s fee exceeds 50 guineas the clerk’s tip is set
down at 2£ per cent, of the fee. Who pockets these
tips? The barrister! He may have a youth on
the landing, or three or four may club together
arid maintain one youth on the landing; but,
whichever way it goes, if the youth gets 7s. 6d. a week
he’s lucky, if he gets 10s. he’s more lucky, and if he draws
15s. he is supposed to be well-to-do. But the tips which
are marked on the bill of Costs as going to the clerk, and
which sometimes come to £4 or £5 a week, are swallowed
by the shark. There are barristers who have no clerk,
hut they take the tips for the clerk all the same. A few
barristers make it up to the clerk one way or another,
either by kindly advice or an occasional tip ; and liberality
in this latter direction has been one of barrister Gor-
don’s characteristics.
“ The Religious Editor”: I see that a
cleric down at Bega (N.S.W. South Coast) has
discovered that the district is being “ insulted ”
once a week by the little coastal steamer
making the place a regular port of call on the
alleged Day of Rest. Prayers are not perishable
like dairy produce, neither have they to be packed
in crates nor poured into cans and hurried to the
wharf; otherwise, the incensed holy man would
probably be found agitating for an extra steamer
for Sunday night, in order that he might get his
goods to market while they were still fresh.
While the “insulting” question is before the
public, someone might as well sit down and ask if
making an unnecessary and prolonged noise with
large bells—as most churches do every Sunday—
isn’t also an insult. I live opposite a church
whose bell is rung on 10 separate occasions each
Sunday—starting at 7 a.tn. Each jangling
spell lasts from eight to 10 minutes, and
conversation has to he carried on in a
series of shouts until the dreadful clangor
ceases. The times at which services are held are
advertised in the usual way on a board outside the
sacred premises. These times are never departed
from and, unless its members are mentally
deficient, the congregation must know when the
various performances fall due. Anyhow, even
supposing that they are incapable of remembering,
it should not be necessary to keep the bell tolling
until the perspiring small-boy ringer loses his first
wild enthusiasm and slows down to knelling pace.
The majority of the flock are well-dressed women
—the sort that takes, say, half-an-hour over a go-
to-meeting toilette. If the bell is intended to
start these women to get ready, they would arrive
only for the last Amen. The fact that they are
generally up to time seems to me a pretty good
indication that they would arrive just the same if
there were no bell at all. While the Church con-
tinues to murder the other fellow’s Sunday sleep un-
necessarily with its metallic advertising device, it
should hold down by the coat-tails the unwise
shepherd who wants to get up and rail at the
Sunday visit of a quiet little steamer.
“Starfish,” on one Australian :
The most vigorous lady-Australian of my acquaintance
has a 3000-acre block on the Stunsail Boom River, Kanga-
roo Island (S. A.). She grows hay and other horse fodder,
runs three or four hundred sheep, and can do and has
done her own shearing, dealing, wood-cutting, fencing,
carting, cooking and housekeeping ; in fact, she mostly
works and lives on the place alone, and is head serang
and general rouseabout. She is a past-mistress in the
art of wallaby and opossum snaring, and can hold her
own with the best of wood-cutters. Once, when the
Eleanor River bridge was reduced to dust and ashes by a
bushfire, the lady arrived at the river from Kingscote,
driving in a spring-cart. She could have turned back
and gone to her brother’s place, five miles away, for help.
But not she ; she wanted to get home right away, and
home lay 15 miles on the other side of the river. So she
took out, the horse, rigged a bridle out of the reins, and
rode to the Stunsail Boom bareback.

The
Business Man
Needs It.
NO man in the thick of business can hope to learn to play the Piano by
old methods. Life is too short and art is too long.
And yet every man longs to play. He never hears a fine performance
without a feeling of regret. In homes where there is a PIANOLA PIANO
the business man can spend his evenings in the delightful atmosphere of
beautiful music. He can forget office worries while wife or daughter
entertain him ; or, better still, he can do the playing himself.
Nothing will smooth out the cares of a busy day, rest the tired mind so
much as to hear the music of one’s favorite composer, or to play over again
the latest hit heard at the theatre or opera.
BECAUSE the Pianola has long passed the point where it could be
regarded as a “ mere Piano-player,” its marvellous powers have
captivated the entire world, and its enormous success becomes greater
and more conspicuous yearly.
A cordial invitation to call is extended to everyone who may be
interested in hearing the STECK PIANOLA PIANO, irrespective of any
intention of purchase.
The STECK PIANOLA PIANO can be played by hand in the
1 ordinary way, or by means of the Pianola action within its case, and may be
bought for cash, or by easy terms, whichever may be preferred.
Your old piano taken in exchange.
If unable to call, write for Catalogue C.
It will be sent Free for the Asking.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, May 9, 1910.
My Dear Yarrie,—
And so Edward the Tactful is gone—disap-
peared into that void where our vision sees nothing
but an extra “date” to be learned by the oncoming
flocks of small history-students. As an ordinary
citizen he would have been quite a success. To
have been held by chains, even if the fetters were
golden and jewel-studded, musthave been irksome
for a man of his temperament. His irons let him
range: no farther than Europe. The sun, which
rarely shone into his London palace, never set
on his kingdom, so they told him ; yet he could
not wiander to the far ends of that kingdom
to bask in the sunshine which might have given
him many more useful years. He was a King
-and.- a treasured prisoner in the heart of his
own world-spread kingdom. Such a little place,
the World—yet he could not see it.
Constitutionally, he was a progressive man. He
pulled down slums and made a motor road to
Brighton. That will tell later on; all the kings
and emperors who ordered the making of roads
have been gratefully remembered.
King George is hampered somewhat by his
named The Four Georges were all so stodgy. The
Fifth; looks almost too frail a man to carry
the of responsibilities which has
been put on his shoulders. And there
have '-been few times when the responsibilities
were greater. England is on the verge of a con-
stitutional crisis. Only a week or two before
Edward’s death the Fortnightly allowed an
anonymous writer to say that in that crisis even
the Crown was on its trial. That was saying too
much, it was held ; and that issue of the Review
was hurriedly withdrawn. Yet the thing was
said, and it shows what some influential people
are thinking.
The new Queen, christened Victoria Mary, has
been universally known as Princess May. But
“Queen May” evidently didn’t appeal to her as
regal enough, so Queen Mary it is to be. It may
set the fashion back to Jane and Elizabeth and
Mary 1 and Anne, and give Errnyntrude and Pearl
a much-needed rest. The family’s own little
hurried lot includes Edward, Albert, Mary,
Henry, George and John. Six of them ; and
Edward will only be 16 in June, while John, at
five, is well “out of hand.”
N.S. Wales’ old friend Carrington got the first
appointment that was made by the Royal George.
He is the new Lord Chamberlain. The Lord
Chairiberlain probably doesn’t have to do much
chamberlaining in a personal way ; but nominally
he has control of all the people who have any-
thing to do with the ceremonial part of the royal
billet. Even the poet laureate is an under-
strapper of the Chamberlain’s ; and the Examiner
of Plays looks to him for official guidance. There
was time when Carrington wouldn’t have
blushed at many a play that has since been blue-
pencilled. But he is 67 now.
Saturday—our universal half-holiday—was a
soft, blue day, a jewel of pleasure suddenly un-
covered after weeks of affliction in the shape of
raging wind. The flags were fluttering gady at
all the grounds in readiness for the week’s sport,
when the black tidings brought them all to half-
mast. A nation in mourning stopped the
machinery of Sport. “ I do wish th’ noos had
come on a week day ! ” a disappointed woman said
lugubriously, crowding along in the congested
swarm of homeward-bound people. “ A ’arf
’oliday is orful when there’s nothink, to do.”
The postponement of the Caulfield races sent
thousands streaming back to town. Football
turned loose more thousands who take their sport
thus gently. All the theatres closed, and Calv 4
had a brief notice stuck on the Town Hall door,
“Sing on Monday.” From midday almost to
midnight the streets of Melbourne were f ull of the
aimless shuffling of the crowds of disappointed
amusement-seekers. ■
The postponement of Calve’s matinee concert,
owing to throat trouble, was certainly worth
while ; for she was a radiant being on the later
date. The Voice is a different thing each time it
is heard—a thing of changeableness and moods
like its mistress. On Thursday afternoon it had
a glory all its own. There was a piteous plaint
she warbled in Italian for an encore that reduced
the house almost to sniffles—at any rate, to a
mushy state of sentimentality. On a fiery duet
with Gasparri from “Carmen” the cold twilight
and the stiffness of the concert platform
frowned coldly in vain. The two sang and
acted with such ardor that Imagination sup-
plied back-cloths, side-wings and scenery. With
these two, an Australian chorus and a few
minor essentials, “ Carmen ” would fill a theatre,
for a good solid- run. “ Pagliacci ” and “ Cavab
leria” would make a dead heat. Adoring
johnnydom in the front seats is beginning to
bet on the fall of the Carmen red rose which
Oalvd flings from her at the end of the passionate
scene. Once it flew to Governor Carmichael's
feet; he Scotchly let it lie. Not so the exuberant
man-about-town, who is haunting the concerts in
dozens.
Alberto Zelman, who belongs to this country,
and coaxes golden melody out of his violin, helped
in this concert, and the instrument sobbed an ex-
quisite accompaniment to the Calve voice. If
someone could rediscover and introduce Zelman
to Australia with a fanfare of advertisement,
Melbourne and the other cities would probably go
off their musical heads. As it is, he has been “in
our midst,” as the papers say, since his childhood,
and he is neither a new excitement nor a boomed
foreigner. For all that, he is a fine conductor ;
also, full of sensitive, fine feeling and natural
leadership.
On Thursday, Calve’s face was like pale ivory
beneath a black seal hat, turned up flat from blue-
black hair. A black velvet sheath hung heavily
with fur at the foot, and the feet were bottined
in French scraps-like gloves. The house almost
rose and hugged her—a house with beaming
managers gently turning away people at the doors.
The Cloth is almost as irritating as a hair shirt
sometimes. Nowadays, what with evening wed-
dings and hatless toilettes, people get terribly
mixed as to what is the correct rig for a knot-
ting. The contracting parties themselves are
all right; they have precedent for the business.
But the rest rustle up to the rails with a look that
says plainly, “ We really don’t know if this is the
correct garb; but we’re here now and it’s, too late
to change.” One night last week some poor little
bridesmaids who arrived in the usual state of
agonising doubt were heatedly rebuked by the
surpliced soul-joiner because they had made the
fatal mistake of wearing nothing on their heads
save their own hair and a few curls they had pur-
chased at odd times. - Some words of dead St.
Paul were hurled at the unhappy maidens by the
humorless cleric, and the wedding was hung up
until the girls hurriedly draped handkerchiefs
over their heads. Only when, they had fixed
themselves up as if for a gale of wind would the
over-heated shepherd start work. This sort of
thing is calculated to drive intending couples
headlong into the nearest registrar’s office.
There is now a Baby Boyle enrolled in the
official suite of Government House, Captain
A.D.C. Boyle having lately been made a proud
papa. Mrs. Boyle is that fair, tall and stately
young matron who is sometimes glimpsed in vice-
regal pens.
The Stork has been lately to the home of the
Pulteney Warford-Meins, at Pakenham, where
the typhoid comes from ; the luggage consisted
of a son and heir. Mrs. P. Warford-Mein was
Miss Tassie Staughton, one of the younger
daughters of Mrs.'S. T. Staughton.
Gladys Chirnside, one of the dead Robert
Chirnside’s chickens, has tired of being a Night-
ingale. For a while she nursed at a private hos-
pital, and had the rigors of the course softened
by having a hansom keb to take her between the
iodoformy domicile,and mamma’s Menzies’suite,
and a maid to help her shed her French shoes and
So forth for the cute thing called a uniform. Evi-
dently patients at last became boring and doctors
mere busy men. Anyhow, nursing’s “off,” and
so’s the lady. She goes shortly to England and
its neighborhood with one of the gentle Fenner
girls as pal. It will be remembered that mamma
married Justice Hodges lately. Possibly the
Menzies’ Hotel suite was found to be unsuitable
for three.
The joy cymbals have been clanged in Toorakian
territory over the homecoming of the Sargood
lady. Daughter Mrs. Rutter Clarke has been in
the lead of the joyful orchestra, and Merriwa—
the Rutter Clarke place—has been the scene of
many handshakings and of afternoon tea without
end.
Artist McCubbin had some folk out to ' his
place, on Sunday last, to look at a few pictures—
particularly a big canvas painted at Macedon,
which the Commercial Travellers’ Club has bought
for a hundred golden guineas. The McCubbins’
house is planted down in the most picturesque
curves of the South Yarra. They also have
a humpy and a farm at Macedon. The McCubbin
children mostly paint and sketch in various grades
of cuteness ; and when a new laborer is acquired,
the whole family study him from a picturesque
standpoint. Then they insist on the newcomer
donning blue jumpers (which isn’t nearly as hard
as inducing Marianne to wear a cap), and when
he has been duly decked they sit round and paint.
They are a quaint little lot, the junior McCubbins.
One is almost a grown-up; a decisive gallery
student. The younger fry are headed by “Moppy,”
with angel brown eyes and white fair hair,
and a strong budding of artistic promise.
“Inky ’’ is a black-browed human boy who scorns
a palette and is keen on making money. There is
a girl like young Guinevere, with straight russet-
brown hair like a veil; and a baby who has made
one of the happiest McCubbin pictures, sitting on
a stool in the glow' of a firelit dusk. There
should be something heard in the artistic world of
to-morrow from the McCubbins junior.
Evelyn Scotney—a young warbler who was
“benefited” in Melbourne at the end of last
year—has reached Marchesi. Melba took her to
the Great One, who is stated to he “ interested.”
The test was so successful that Melba drove her
hilariously all round Paris to look at the Floods
as a sort of glory-tail to the day.
Miss Newbold, who is another claimant for
Marchesi condescension, was also taken by Melba
into a circle of encouragement. This young
songstress had no “benefit”, but managed bv
sheer hard work to get to the desired fountain of
vocal knowledge. Now,she is hoping to pack, a
four years’ course into two years’ hard graft, for
the sake of economy in time, in foreign parts.
Her trill is her strong point, and she has
already mastered it to Marchesi’s satisfaction.
Some never can manage it, and go away broken-
hearted and weeping like the “ Little Seamstress”
in “Trilby,” whose natural bird-trill Svengali
broke, “and so no more.” Melba is reported to
have said that the- Newbold natural trill was
better than her own at the same point of un-
tutored time. The owner of it got a wonderful
hold on breathing through exercises learnt
under the tuition of Nellie Veitch, that clever
physical-culture exponent. Marchesi put a
large ostrich feather in Miss Yeitch’s cap by
asking where Miss Newbold had learnt her
breathing exercises. “In Australia ! ” Marchesi
turned to her French and English girls: “How
is it that this girl brings this perfection from
far-away Australia—and you neglect it so?”
And the class was silent.
The Clarke-Mevnell people have captured
what on paper looks like an interesting young
man for the name-part in their “ Pete ” co. The
young man who is to bear the heat and burden of
the night and the matinee is Matheson Lang,
“the sop of a clergyman and educated for the
church”; and as “Pete” is a dramatisation of
Hall Caine’s “Manxman,” that righteous author
probably approves of the choice of leading
man. Not, of course, that the son of
thp manse isn’t sometimes a sinner; but
as Matheson Lang has also an Archbishop
in the family, he isn’t any ordinary son of
the manse—the ties that bind him to the
ways of strict propriety are ever so much stronger
than usual. The Archbishop in the case is the
most rev. of York ; the player and the prelate are
cousins.
Cromwell, the Arcadian, is driving the Chan-
tecler girls wild with his new hat. It is a
beautiful mother chook with several downy chicks
like yellow pom-poms hopping all over it. A
mere dead chook is not in the same fowlyard
with it.
Freda Sternberg, a clever Victorian medicine
woman, is back in Melbourne, after a fourteen
months’ trip through Europe. “ Bacteriologist”
is written after her name ; and she is an ardent
hunter of the Microbe, though she is only in her
early twenties. She used to help Dr. AlacTnerney
with his cultures and jellies and marvellous col-
lection of germs. (Dr. Nelly, his nephew and
partner, was at the same time an earnest
investigator of the ways of the wigglv things.)
After Dr. Mclnerney’s death, Miss Sternberg
went for this journeying. She studied both at
the Pasteur Institute and at the new Lister
College in London, where Prof. Martin—at one
time Professor of Physiology at Melbourne Uni-
versity—is now in charge. Whilst in Fogtown,
MissSternbergdeveloped an intense desire to study
in Dr. Bullock’s “lab.” Dr. Bullock is one of the
most renowned medieoes in London Hospital, and
has a fascinating reputation as a woman-hater.
Miss Sternberg, however, went along and found
him perfectly tame. She worked for a week in the
great man’s “ lab.,” making germ soups; and
then the Board rose and remembered that no
woman other than a nurse had ever before worked
in the London Hospital, and the clever girl was
gently shooed off the premises. Whereupon, Dr.
Bullock convoyed her to Lister’s, the germicidal
college, and handed her over to Prof. Martin as a
clever recruit. With her wealth of recently-
acquired knowledge the assertive young woman-
medico is starting “on her own’’ in Melbourne,
with the assistance of Dr. Nelly’s laboratory.
Mark Twain was not a drinking man ; but there
was a particular brand of whisky he liked a nip
of occasionally. For a big smoke concert which
was tendered him in Melbourne a stock of this
particular dew was got in. Mark, in the course
of the evening, absorbed a considerable quantity
of the Whisky, yet showed no signs of it. A man.
who walked back with him to his tavern and
spent a couple more of the small hours yarning,
asked him, “ How is it you manage to carry so
much whisky—you’re as sober as a judge?”
Mark drawled, drolly, “I’m never drunk when
I’m drinking; but my! I’m awful drunk next
day.”
The Melbourne Hunt Club’s first meet of the
season was fixed for Saturday, 21st. The hounds
were to meet at Oakleigh railway station, and
there was to be tea at the Kennels for the
socially-disposed after the cross-country scurry ;
but in the present universal upset of arrange-
ments this programme may be varied.
Two sisters of a professional man are knocking
the Block endwise since their return from foreign
parts to this sunny corner of the earth’s crust.
When someone exclaims at the studied gorgeous-
ness of their raiment, the subject is dismissed
lightly with the phrase, “Just a few rags we
picked up in Sloane-street.” The worst of it is
that the average Australian does not know Sloane-
street very well—which rather tends to make the
sally fall flat.
The passing of Bjornstjerne Bjornson must
have been almost as impressive as the laying to
rest of! a Viking. “Farthest North” Nansen,
who has seen the ice solitudes, read the burial
service ; kings and queens came humbly to the
coffining ; and over it all Wagner’s music moaned
and wailed the grief of a nation.
From; “Rosna,” of Adelaide :
Melbourne has safely returned us the vice-regal twin
with words of commendation.
This wjeek Mr. Chamber-of-Manufactures Cleland has
shown the gubernatorial folk, separately and collectively,
over every square inch of the Exhibition, because it will
be dead by the time this reaches you, and they may
never see it again.
On Wednesday eve Her Ex. (in a grey satin raiment)
and the daughters went to the Josiah Symon dame’s
poetry rivel. “The Poetry Recital Society)” it is called,
and this was its inaugural meeting. The banqueting-
room of the Town Hall was crowded; half the crowd
wore its hat and the other half its low-neck, but they all
wore their Culture. Sassiety was there in moderation,
and some of the other people were certainly poets. Judge
Gordon, the silver-tongued, who knows more about the
heart and soul of poetry than most people, told the
gathering some rhymes worth hearing, and Senator Symon
and ex-Attorney-General Paddy Glynn tore themselves
away from saving the Commonwealth to dispense
eloquence on Australian and Irish verse respectively.
The Muse of the ’Roo country was given a kindly pat on
the back, one of the Society’s objects being to encourage
its members to appreciate her. A copy of the verses of
Agnes Storrie. she being a poet we grew in Adelaide’s
own garden, was presented to her Excellency, with some
original verse all for herself on the title page. By the
way, if you are a poet you may send your outbursts to
this society and it will read them without a murmur.
(N.B. The meeting ended in supper, which is banal; but
even poets must be fed.)
We had a braw Scotch nicht on Thursday of last week.
The Caledonian Society got into the Town Hall and had
a ball, and “ reeled” and “keeled ”at great length. Mr.
Weinyss, from Mitcham, chieftained the revel, and there
were Scotch sets and hunting sets, and summer sets and
other sets. The vice-regals and the twins were there ;
also the Mayoral Cohens, the Crawfords, Alec Buchanans,
A. J. McLachlans, and all the Scottishstocracy we could
find.
Miss Violet Teague has come over from Melbourne with
one set of paint brushes and another of artistic notions.
She is helping the Pageant along as stage-manager, and
proving a boon to the show for various reasons. To
begin with, being a stranger, she is not inclined to be
over-awed by our Richandgreat. but can order it to
rehearsals and criticise its gait without a tremble. She
is also exercising her talents on the scenery', which is
going to defy description.
Certain of the young and active Pageant element is
thirsting to have a dance as a final outburst, commencing
directly after the Pageant, in the Elder Hall. But this is
not decided yet, the wiser having visions of a hundred
and forty wilted damsels, foot-and-temper-sore from
rehearsing and excitement, trooping in from the Exhi-
bition to the Elder Hall, there to find onp man and a dog
to dance with.
The Royal Comics are gladdening our noise-loving
hearts this week.
This year’s first bloom of Conservatorium music burst
open last week. Three damsels, with bird-notes above
the average, lifted their high K’s to the rafters, the most
considerable being Mary Roach, already known as a
clever fiddler. Others were Miss Forsaith and a Mack
maiden. The laurels for instrumental noise were clasped
in the clever fingers of Sylvia Whitington, who cajoled
many heavenly sounds from her fiddle. The orchestra
will browse among'the works of the late Beethoven and
co. on May 16.
An Alliance Fransaise threatens to materialise here.
It is to have its habitat in the May Club rooms, and
during the year there will be six afternoon sessions and
six evening ditto, when French conversation, drama and
polish will be disbursed gratis. Who is to dis-
burse them remains a mystery, but no doubt it will be
divulged in time. This reminds me that a clever and in-
teresting French citizen of this Trammy city, Mrs
Lion, has written a novel, which is being published in
Paris. The story has an Australian setting.
Sydney has been buying up our Will Ashton’s pictures,
but Adelaide is too busy getting its Haughty Culture in
trim to buy pictures from anybody. At the Society of
Arts Exhibition, now just ceasing its course, the over-
whelming number of three canvases have been purchased
to date. And the secretary simply blushes for the greed
of a public that snaps up art treasures with such fearful
velocity.
Adelaide Literary Theatre’s membership has jumped to
430; and something like a thousand (Or slightly more)
people have announced their intention of seeing each of
the first three performances. All" the seats for each
Saturday night were booked before the plan had been
open two days.
The picturesque suburb of Hawthorn, where our good
Premier Price spent his last days, is to provide itself with
a sports oval to his memory. There is also to be a
memorial to another good citizen, the late Catherine
Helen Spence ; it will probably take the form of an
annual festival to the old people at “ the Destitute,” Miss
Spence having been deeply interested in that institution,
and the only woman to have served on the Board.
Mr. R. Burns Cuming died last week, having been ill
ever since his return from a British jaunt a month or two
ago. He was managing director of the Adelaide Chemical
Company, was a former Mayor' of Thebarton, one of the
Chamber of Manufactures people, an enthusiast at bowls
and cricket, and various other things. He leaves a widow,
one unmarried daughter, besides a married one and
three sons.
Sincerely yours, Johanna.
“ Frilled Lizard ” takes out her hatpin :
“ 0.K.” (B. 21/4/’10) on Vida Goldstein and the general
inefficiency of Vida’s sex is funny, but not convincing.
The lady certainly made a mistake in going on the sex
ticket. I can’t say more than that, because I was too
busy combating the good, old man-made Fusion to follow
the lady’s meetings. But I can’t see for the life of me
why her lack of logic should be typical of the general
helplessness of women. With “O.K.’s” condemnation
of the “go-cart” I agree. But it was man, not woman,
who invented go-carts ; and, anyhow, go-carts are a de-
cided success as to wheels, lightening the labor of push-
ingj even if they are a failure as to body. A genius—it
may be “0.K.” himself—will perhaps some day design a
perfect child’s carriage.
The assertion that man excels woman in every branch
of what is called woman’s work is not borne out by fact.
It is simply a question of individual qualification and
taste. There is a variety of human that dres-es in male
attire, but in habits, tastes and qualifications generally
is feminine even to cattishness. This variety can simply
run over the average woman when it comes to spring-
cleaning or even general housework. It is commonly
natty and very clean, but has the usual fault of the ultra-
feminine of being fond of backbiting and strong tea.
This variety of male has its complement in the female
who is a better roughrider than her brothers, can put in
a good day’s work with the double furrow, who ring-
barks, splits posts and rails, and puts up fences, is a
cattle-doctor, and can muster, brand, etc., with the help
of the hired man. It is usually shy and awkward in the
company of women, hut is never mean nor treacherous.
There seems nothing to account for these strange
varieties of human except the theory that sex is decided
by something more than mere physical form and male
or female attire—or even by the particular work it should
do.
As a matter of fact, men are responsible to-day for our
atrocious fashions in millinery and very probably hair-
dressing—that is to say, nominal men ; and against that
there are woman coat-hands and buttonhole-hands in our
leading tailors’ workrooms. The only pull that a man-
tailor has over a woman-tailor is in pressing. There,
weight and muscle tell. Given weight for weight and
equal training, things would very likely be equal.

The theatre and the music-hall are coming very close
together in London. Seymour Hicks and his wife,
Ellaline Terriss, are booked for three years ahead to do
seven months “ variety ”in each year. “ This leaves five
months for theatres,” said the restless Hicks to a London
Referee interviewer. “ Nothing for resting. Never
rest. Why rest?” And his next season’s theatre pro-
duction is to be nothing less than “ Richard the Third,”
splendidly mounted, at a leading theatre to be taken for
the purpose.

MR. DONALD McDONALD (the well-known
writer) describes the Trip as follows:
the greater part of the journey on the Queensland
coast the steamer runs between the Great Barrier
Reef and the mainland, making it one of the
smoothest of the sea trips of Australasia. The route is
dotted with picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange
to southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands,
steaming into fine bays and estuaries. The famous
Whitsunday Passage, between Mackay and Bowen, is
extremely picturesque.

“In a short railway ride of 20 miles
from Cairns one may travel through
somj of the finest scenery in Aus-
tralasia, culminating in the magnificent
Barron Falls—the king of cataracts. The
trains run most of the way along the
Barron Gorge, in scenery wild and
majestic, and the trip is one which
no tourist going northwards should
miss. I have r dden on the box
seat of a coach through the famous
Buller and Otira Gorges of New Zealan 1,
and looked practically down into et r-
nity, with only a solid foot of roadway
intervening; but it is not more thdiling
than this railway run through the Barron
Gorge, where there is always a com-
forting feeling that your lease of life is
not terminable by a false step on the
part of one of the leading horses. The
train stops at the. Falls, of which thcre is
a superb view. There is no necessity to
rhapsodise —go and see it.” .

in “TYPHOID FLY”
DANGEROUS DOMESTIC PEST.
This is our well-known domestic pest—the
common house fly. In addition to being a typhoid
carrier, the fly may carry nearly all the intestinal
diseases and is the prime agent in the spread of
summer dysentery, being in this way unquestion-
ably responsible for the death of many children
in summer. The fly also possesses importance as
a disseminator of the bacilli of tuberculosis, the
danger of human infection from tubercular fly
specks being by the ingestion of the specks
on food.
It is a startling thought that a person who
drinks a cup of tea or a glass of milk into which a
fly has fallen may take into his system 1,250,000
bacilli of typhoid, dysentery or tuberculosis.
Summing up the position, the typhoid or house
fly is a general or common carrier of pathogenic
bacteria. It may carry typhoid fever, Asiatic
cholera, dysentery, cholera morbus and other
intestinal diseases. It may carry the bacilli
of tuberculosis and certain eye diseases. It
is everywhere present, and it is disposed
of with comparative ease by the use of
INSECTIBANE.
INSECTIBANE is sold everywhere, but it
is necessary to be careful to observe the spelling
of the name, as no other insect powder possesses
the qualities which render INSECTIBANE so
peculiarly efficacious.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
There was no sport in Australasia last Satur-
day. Everything was laid under a spell; the footballer
ceased from his kicking-, the cricketer left his bat in the
corner, the sculler laid his scull in the shed. The royal
Edward had played the Master Player and lost. And he
was as good a loser as he had ever been a winner.
* * * *
It was Sydney’s own Melnstoush who practi-
cally forced Jeffries into the ring with Johnson, and Jeff-
ries got level with him by ostentatiously turning down
his bid for the fight. Jeffries was acting the part of the
uncouth hog when Melnstoush was in N’York, and the
average Yank seemed to regard him as something'half-
divine, which could not be forced or pushed. When
Melnstoush blew in there was immediately-an atmosphere
of irreverence about, and, after lialf-aii-hour of chin-
wagging, with surly grunts in reply from Jeffries,
the great man suddenly snapped out that one of
these days he would hammer that gold-darned
nigger to mush. “That’s what I want,” said Meln-
stoush, producing papers and a cheque-book. “ Here's
a cheque for $5OOO, marked correct by the Bank,
and if you’ll sign this agreement to fight Johnson any-
where or at any time before middle old age, it’s yours,
Jeff. Just sign right here, Jeff, and then we can shut up
these squibs who say you’re scared to meet this nigger.”
Jeffries was too furious to speak; but when he got his
breath he refused to sign anything, or take any cheque
for $5OOO, and terminated the interview. But his hand
was forced, and he began to lose prestige, with the sure
and certain knowledge that the only way to regain it was
to edge slow-ly towards the ring. He began to edge, and,
once started, could not stem the weight of public pressure,
till now he stands right in the middle of it.
* * *. *
Curiously enough, it seems that Jeffries is an
intensely nervous man and that there has always been
difficulty about getting him into the ring. In fact, on
some occasions he has been got in only by the threat that if
he didn’t go he would be carried in; and then he has
been fairly- shoved there. But once in he loses his
nervousness, or it sends him baresark, or something, and
he fights like 10,000 wild cats suddenly let loose, each
with a fish-tin on its tail.
The Melnstoush is of the opinion that Johnson
is likely to win this scrap. Also, he is of the opinion that
the fight will be absolutely on the square, and that John-
son will strain every nerve to win. In fact, he says that
J hnson must win, or his future is very dark. They
tolerate him in the U.S.A. just now because he is world
champion. But once he is licked they’ll turn on him like
tigers and fairly- hunt him out of the country. The
prize is enormous, and beyo.nd it Johnson can
see a long, long term of fat and easy engage-
ments with the various variety theatres throughout
the country. It is his one chance to make his
fortune. If he goes down he will certainly have to leave
the States, and they don’t want him in England since he
broke faith over Langford ; and although he might last a
while in Paris, Parisian public fancy is very fickle where
the male performer is concerned ; and in Germany the
idea of a white man being slogged by a nigger would be a
scandal which the authorities would never allow to come
off. But more than- all, there is the fierce, malignant
hatred Johnson has for the White. He has beaten their
best so far. Physically he is as good a man as any
White, and infinitely better than most of them.
In ability he reckons he is better than most of
them too, for he has a certain amount of culture—
dabbles in literature, anthropology-, physics and music.
He feels that he is in every- way a'better man than 15 out
20 of the white loungers he meets in the streets of the
American cities; yet when he got into the white man’s
car in a N’York tram, a perky little conductor with lan-
tern jaws and a red face came along almost.bursting w ith
fury : “ Saay, you black smoke, what yo’ doin’ here ?
Git, you long, blastiferous streak of mud-colored meat;
git, I saay-, git to your kennel with the rest of the black
trash.” And Johnson “ gitted.” If he w-alks into a
hotel he is made to go to the black man’s dining-room,
and in a thousand and one ways every- day is
made to feel that he is a member of an inferior
race. When he proposed to go and see his mother
he was told, because he had dared to take a white wife, he
would find tar and feathers waiting him. And it rankles,
and it has rankled for years ; so that when Johnson gets
a member of the hated arrogant race where he can slog
him to his heart’s content, if he can, he will slog for all
he is worth, for all that he has suffered, and for all that
his race has suffered. No matter what he may agree to
outside, in the ring he will fight to win. And, as the
Melnstoush figures it out, he is a skilful fighter, a strong
man, and has all the physical ability to back up his racial
hatred. Self-interest, racial prejudice and avarice are all
urging Johnson to batter Jeffries to pulp—if he can.
* * * *
After much fighting between the alleged pro-
moters, the scene of the scrap has been definitely fixed
at Emeryville, a w-ater-suburb of San Francisco, the
arena to be erected to hold 50,000 at prices ranging from
50dols. to sdols. A curious regulation is that the seats
will all be booked in advance in ’Frisco, and the crow-d as
it files in is to be searched for firearms. How that will be
managed, only Heaven knows. Probably it is a mere
threat to induce people to leave their guns at home.
Jeffries is training in the mountains north of ’Frisco, in
the Santa Cruz district, and Johnson is in the Lake
eountry, north of Chicago, where he is indulging in 25-
mile sprints daily. ’jVho his trainers are have not trans-
spired, but Jeffries has. Corbett, wrestler Gotch and Joe
Choynski all hard at w-ork on him.
* * * #
Writing to a relative, Corbett lately gave an in-
sight into the doings of the Santa Cruz camp : “The big
fellow (Jeffries) will have to fight me many fights in
private, just as I used to do with Ruhlin 10 years ago. I
know that I’m going to take several knock-out punches,
and I know that I will be up against the toughest game
of my life, but I’m willing to go through it all for the
sake of landing the championship where it belongs— to
the white race.” Corbett is a good white man, anyhow.
* * * *
“0.K.” : I didn’t see the Burns-Lang affair,
nor am I a little bit favorably inclined to Tahmy Burns ;
yet the par. in last issue re the vaporings of Lang’s bar-
rackers strikes me as being an ample justification of the
referee’s decision; The half-dozen times that I’ve seen
Lang fight he was invariably slower and less clever than
his opponent, and but for knocking-out his man (in five
cases out of six) he must have been out-pointed. Pitted
against a strong, active tactician like Burns, there could
be no chance for Lang to win on points. He is Bill the
Unready. He swipes wildly, and when, in the words of
the par. that appeals to me, he does score a heavy blow,
he stands off and waits for the other chap to die instead
of wading in to kill him. All I can hear in reasonable
excuse for Lang’s defeat is the allegation (truthful, seem-
ingly) that he “broke” his right hand (or was it his
left ?), which accident took a big discount off his chance
of finishing the comparatively unfit Tahmy. Certainly
his hand was being doctored as recently as last week.
The excuse looks genuine as far as it goes. But it merely
goes to convince me, who didn’t see the fight, that Lang,
with a damaged hand, must have been even less aggres-
sive than usual, and was therefore fairly- beaten on points
by the alert aggressor whom he did not knock out.
* * * *
A recent battle in Melbourne was Bill Lewis
versus Bill Carrie. The latter was welterweight ama-
teur champion last year; but, fancying there was boodle
in the biff business, he has taken to bash as a means of
taming his daily bread. Lewis is a product of novice
competitions. The fight was not “ class.” Carrie has a
good left and a fair variety of swipes, but he is as slow as
the mills of the gods, and gets after his opponent with
the celerity of a milestone. Lewis is even less expert.
He can hit hard, but the men he can hit are not con-
spicuous successes as pugilists. Lewis had had enough
after 16 rounds, and collapsed in his chair. Carrie, if he
learns to shift himself with some velocity, may become a
ring-master in a fair way of business.

Boxer Moran, who smote M ‘Carthy a fatal

Melbourne got news of the death of the sovereign
who started life as pacemaker and ended it as peace-
maker just in time to postpone the day’s football matches,
but not soon enough to save a good many barrackers the
trouble of going to the grounds. The managers of one
match were so belated that the players were already
stripped when the flag was half-masted. Happenings
during- the week had raised expectations of unpleasant-
ness at sundry games if they had been played. One star
League man had asked and received a permit to play for an
Ass. club ; but two days later he waited on theLeagueand
asked to be allowed to stay with his old love. The
League viewed him coldly, and said he would have to wait
a week or two while it considered things ; but he swore
he would play on Saturday, League or no League. Also
a League club captain who had yielded to the blandish-
ments of an Ass. club desired a blessing on his transfer,
but, being told he should have asked the bles-ing first and
the transfer afterwards, promptly told the officials to bag
themselves, and was thereupon disqualified as a League
’bailer for evermore. In the intervals of enticing League
top-notchers the Ass. appointed three “ independent
commissioners” to view the collisions and deal with
violent and unseemly players, and also to keep a wary
eye on the ill-regulated barracker; but, as aforemen-
tioned, all these eventualities became strung up and
postponed.
The Wowser may be derided, but he has to be
reckoned with all the same, as the people who wanted to
open the Double Bay tennis courts (Sydney) on Sundays,
for private games among the members, found to their
cost. At the first struggle a majority decided in favor
of opening the courts, and then the Wow-ser party un-
earthed a rule to the effect that, as it was a change in the
constitution, the proposal must be carried by a three-
fourths majority. At a second meeting a fresh vote was
taken, and again a majority decided in favor of opening,
the figures being 104 to 63. But even that wasn’t the re-
quired majority, so the courts will remain closed. The
Wowsers don’t mind being in .the minority so long as
they can carry their point; and the fact that theminority
is tyrannising over nearly twice their number doesn’t
worry the Wowser mind in the slightest.

One-time N.S.W. tennis-players Poidevin and
Doust recently gained much glory by defeating Barrett
and Gore for the Covered Court Doubles Championship
of England by three sets to two. Maorilander F. Wilding
is on his way to join Poidevin and Doust, and the three
will then fall upon everything that will get in the way
before Wilding hurries back to meet the invaders who
will be after the Davis Cup.

Barry, who is to meet Arnst on the Zambesi, is
having a rough time and getting anything but a fair deal.
Barry’s misfortune is that he is poor. He earns his crust
by the arduous occupation of heaving coal aboard ships
in the Thames ; and the result is that he has to depend
upon outsiders to finance his race with Dick Arnst. He
is a mighty rower, but would probably be a better one
still if he had some reasonable chance to make himself
fit and had not to pursue the elusive bob quite
so strenuously. Ex-Maorilander “Tom ” Sullivan, who
has hitherto looked after him, has retired from
the job of trainer. He has had no row with Barry,
apparently, but after the £950 had been put up by public
subscription, a crowd of fellows, representing those who
had put up the pelf, interfered, humbugged and played
the dickens generally, till at last Sullivan could stand it
no longer, and threw up the billet. No doubt another
trainer will be found easily enough ; but he is not likely
to be as good as Sullivan, who knows the game from A
to Z, and also knows Barry from the other end of the
alphabet and right through it.

Leaked out that the auditors had wanted
more information about the balance-sheet presented
by the Australian XI., which some months ago
returned from an English jaunt. It seems that
the team laid itself out to baulk the representative
of the Board of Control in every way, by neglect-
ing to give him proper accounts, or hand over vouchers
to show how the money was divided up. The result was
that he was unable to keep his books properly, and the
auditors confess that, under the circumstances, they
cannot imagine how the team managed to arrived at an
equitable division of the. money. The team seems to
have thought that it was very smart; but it
now finds that it has played right into the
hands of the Board of Control. It has to account
for the money ; and the disgraceful way it be-
haved is overwhelming proof that the Board o‘f Control
must have absolute management of all future teams, and
that the business manager, and. treasurer should be the
same party, and that party a paid employee of the Board
of Control. In the meantime, the management of the
team has been, it is said, asked to supply fuller details
and more information. It is not suggested that there is
any money missing or that anything dishonest has been
done ; but the right thing has apparently been done the
most utterly wrong way. And that all things may be in
order, the Board’s fiduciary agent must have supreme
control of all future tours.

The Timaru-Christchurch road race, a big
Maoriland bike fixture, has been set back from October
29 to September 3. This will give Maoriland riders a
chance to compete in the Goulburn to Sydney and the
Warrnambool to Melbourne spins.
That disqualification of A. J. Clark for the
championship of France appears to reflect more discredit
on the French judges than on the ex-Australian rider.
Most of the French papers condemn the disqualification.
The championship is decided on points—four events.
Clark had won three and was second in the fourth, and
the prize was his, but the judges disqualified him for
running out when approaching the finishing.line. Clark
explained that he did so to avoid a disastrous collision,
which was imminent through a French rider’s erratic
steering. The judges gave the palm to Friol. Clark re-
ports that cycling is booming in France, and Sunday
meetings in Paris draw regular crowds of 20,000 to 25,000
people. He is at present under the management of Floyd
MacFarland, and will compete in the World’s Sprint
Championship next Julv.

“ 0.K.”: John Roberts is 63, it is said ; so he
must have been born about 45 years earlier than the Aus-
tralian lad, George Gray. A wonderful man in more than
one respect is Roberts. He has preserved his facial
appearance and figure whilst maintaining all the
characteristics of his “form” in billiards. Just now he
is nearing the end of a 12-days’ match with Campbell, the
Vic. champion, at Alcock’s Parlor (Melbourne), and to see
him running up breaks at' the rate of 100 in six
minutes, or less, is a lesson in the art and
an evidence of the healthfulness of his game.
He seems physically stronger and brighter than
the last time he visited Australia, and, except that his
iron-grey hair is now lather more grey and less iron, he
is identically the same commanding person who came
here 20 years ago, when Sarah Bernhardt was around.
Such spryness as he shows at three-score years and three
is the more extraordinary because he carries so much
weight. If he took but little exercise he would
probably wax fat and go to 18st. As it is, he keeps
up his flesh whilst “ playing for safety.” He teetotals and
eschews tobacco, and looks in the pink of condition for
scoring 750 paints at each “session.” This time he stipu-
lates for ivory balls, which is a grievance with local players,
who have suited their billiards to the heavier bonzalines.
Roberts, of course, is merely reverting to his original
weight of stroke, so to speak. The “ click of the ivories”
was his only music in the old days, and considering that
he afterwards took up the bonzalines and insisted upon
using'them in his matches, his return to the discarded
implements of warfare is—well, like the old, masterful
campaigner. All the same, he pan fairly argue that the
ivories lend themselves more readily to brilliant strokes
than the bonzalines. As a show player the old man is
just as good as ever. He has lost some of his capacity for
sustaining a delicate manipulation of the balls, and some
of his accuracy of eyesight in longshots, perhaps ; but his
style is free and bold as before, and his variety is
charming.

Aviation meetings in Europe are great spec-
tacles and yield handsome profits to the gentlemen who
do the soaring; but the promoters do not always get
their money'back. The big carnival at Rheims (France)
resulted in a deficit of £8200; which is a nasty snag for
any promoter to bump. But the same crowd is coming
again on July 3, and will keep going till the 10th, and it
is hoped that the week will produce something extra-
dazzling in the way of flights. The trouble is that these
aeroplane racing meetings do but little for serious avia-
tion. The aeroplane, as a present constructed, is going
to cut but little ice in the world. The serious side of
aerial navigation is the flying warship and cargo tramp.
And that will never be advanced one iota by promoting
these spectacular gatherings, any more than breeding
useful horses will be advanced by the frequency of pony
race-meetings.
There was a sound of riot in Wellington (M.L.)
when Alec. Bain and R. J. Scott met for the wrestling
championship of the Plutonic Isles, and with it aside
wager of 50 sovereigns. It was an awful go, both men
ripping, tearing and gouging, till Bain got a “ scissors ”
grip and well nigh choked Scott before the latter caved
in. The second bout was even woollier than the first ;
but that time Scott was more wary, and the result was
no fall. But, as he had scored the majority, Bain took
the honor and the boodle, and immediately announced
his intention of seeking out Clarence Weber and tying a
knot in him.

At Narandera (N.S.W.) last week a jockey
named Brown had a regular field day. As Homer put it,
he was on the job, and piloted eight winners in nine
mounts. Naturally the prad that Brown pushed along
became favorite, and Christian Noses cursed him and his
forbears and his seed to the 10th generation. It was, in
fact, one of the few days on which Noses was done
brown.

A queer thing happened at the Kedron Park
(Brisbane) races the other day. (Kedron Park is one of
the northern capital’s unregistered courses.) In the
Pony Handicap a nag named Lovelight is alleged to have
passed the winning-post.ahead of the other three starters
—one sporting writer reckoned it was a half-length win—
and wasn’t even placed by the judge. The crowd there-
upon made uncomplimentary remarks about that official’s
eyesight, and eventually the rider of the moke, who was
too flabbergasted at first to do anything but gasp, gave
his opinion in similar language. For this he and the nag
were presented with six months’ disqualification. So far
the judge hasn’t been presented even with a pair of
glasses.

“ M.P.” writes : “I still have sufficient con-
dition with the pen to battle out another heat on the
alleged 9§sec. for 100yds., run by Jack Donaldson. How-
ever, up to date ‘Angry Australian ’ hasn’t supplied one
interesting fact about the Donaldson-Postle-Holway
affair or given any information on clocking. I’m quite
prepared to leave Donaldson or any other ped.
out, and to confidently state that there is no
runner in the world capable, under honest conditions,
of running 9gsec. or anything like it. In England Hol-
way beat Postle in a 100yds. match in 2yds. outside even
time on a wet track. The Donaldson 9jfsec. was created
on a wet track ; the last 40yds. was really mud. Yet on
this heavy track a runner was credited with 6jyds.
better than even time 1 Shade of Charlie Samuels 1
All the * heads ’ were naturally anxious to snap
the time, but Naylor was too cute. The run-
ners were shot off before the onlookers could collect
themselves, and the tape didn’t go up in position until
the runners were well down the track. The fact that
Rufe Naylor was lock, stock and barrel of the show-
means that he controlled the race, watches and all, and
made it his business to see that abnormal times were
made. If the same-Rufe Naylor, Donaldson, Postle, Bill
McManus, J. H. King, Fred Murray, or the late Geo.
Weeks had a man up their sleeve for a Stawell Gift, they
would not run him against a watch, because, on their own
sound know-ledge of the game, they know it is unsatis-
factory. They pit man against man—the watch is a
secondary consideration.
“ I don’t cast bricks at Donaldson as a runner—
I’ve expressed my very humble opinion on that subject
before —but I scoff at his times, and I know that I echo
the opinions of the experts. The giants of the Botany
days in Sydney were equal physically and as runners to
the peds to-day, and for a level lOOvds. they couldn’t get
within cooee of 9§sec. Fancy Donaldson standing Frank
Hewitt or Samuels nearly 4yds. in lOO.vds.! Yet ‘ Angry
Australian ’ would have to allot Hewitt that start,
if he innocently accepts the 9fsec. record.
“A. A. Taylor, who has.left Australia in search
of the Donaldsoh Crowd, ran at Ballarat (Vic.) recently.
Standing on 3vds., with Jack Godfrey on 9yds., the
watch made Taylor run 127yds. in 11 9-10 sec., Taylor
just taking the tape from Godfrey. This made Taylor
run Sydsi inside evens and Godfrey 2yds. inside level
time. When this performance was made Godfrey was
running probably syds.outside lOsec. for 100yds. Jack
himself says he can never do better than lOJsec., yet
the watch made him run faster than he is capable of run-
ning. A couple of seasons ago Ddnaldson (6Jyds.) and
Godfrey (7£.vds.) met in a 130yds. handicap at Kerang
(Vic.). Godfrey won by inches. To-day, assuming we
take the 9§sec. on the ‘ Angry Australian ’ authority,
Donaldson should stand Godfrey lljyds. in a level
100yds. I can safely say that every pro. ped. (I don’t
go nap on amateur -runners’judgment in the sprint de-
partment) in Australia would put his shoes on Godfrey
to win easily.
“Here’s another instance of silly timing. At
Shepparton (Vic.), some time ago, the clockists made
Taylor run 125yds. in 11 2-ssee., which amounts to 11yds.
inside even time. Bill M‘Manus was in his day the equal
of any present-day runners, and was made to run some
remarkable times. He has stated publicly that in all his
career as a sprinter he doubts whether he ever ran even
time for lOOvds. Dig up some of his performances,
and the recordings of the clockists will stagger any
enthusiast. If ‘ Angry Australian ’or any other innocent
accepts the 9§sec. farce, it simply goes to prove that mugs
still follow a game about which an ancient once re-
marked, ‘Never back anything that can talk.’ I might
further remark that it is inadvisable to place any faith in
a showman who runs footrunners as a kind of circus.
The Conway-Tinder affair, which is a pill to swallow,
occurred ori the same ground where Naylor gave to the
world the 9|sec. that no sane judge of athletics in the
universe accepts.”

Footracing is one of the decayed industries of
Bananaland. At one time every district football “ union ”
had its annual sports, and something decent could gene-
rally be expected. Then the private promoter jumped
in and ran “hundreds ” all over the shop, and that killed
the game. So Mount Morgan’s Rugby Union, which has
been holding clean sports for the last 15 years (two meet-
ings a year), has just been stared in the face by its first
deficit.

The Victorian Amateur Athletic Association is
struggling to get out of its financial bog, into which the
much talked-of Pageant pushed it. At a recent council
meeting a motion was submitted that a double affiliation
fee be charged ; but some of the clubs squealed, and the
idea was eventually settled with a knock-out blow.
Thereupon it was proposed to hold a theatre party ; and
a bomb was hurled at the paid officials with an announce-
ment that their screws would have to be reduced by half.
Members of the association are also being urged to display
their much-advertised enthusiasm for “clean" sport by
taking up £1 debentures issued in connection with the
New Amateur Sports Ground.

The other day the representatives of eight
churches—R.G., Congregational, 0. of E., Metholeyan,
Baptist, Scotchby'terian, C. of Christ, and Latter pay
Saints—foregathered at the new Victorian township of
Powlett to select sites for their buildings. Apparently
the Lord beckoned several of them to the most desirable
site, and, as prayer brought them no nearer a solution,
they had a Tatt’s. sweep for it, just like ordinary sinners.

Among the postponed events of last Saturday
was the fingl of the Parramatta Hundred on Sydney’s
classic river. This event will now be spun off on this
Saturday, the 14th ; to delay it longer would mean that
Dick Arnst would not be able to take part in it, as he
leaves for Africa on the following Wednesday. And the
Parramatta Hundred without Arnst would be like
boiled eggs for breakfast without the yolks. If Arnst
wasn’t there, there would be practically no gate, and a
sculling match without gate is the plain devil. It is
rather a shock to the proprieties to hold a sculling match
for filthy lucre on the day of the funeral of the best King
England has had since the days of the Plantagenets;
but as Arnst must leave for Africa on the Wednesday,
what can a harassed management do?
* * * *
The English Northern Union team, now on its
way to Australia to play matches with the Rugby
League in the continent and M.L., is certainly
a formidable combination on paper, and if it only
lives up to its alleged character, there should
be some exciting struggles. There are 26 in the crowd,
and they are said to be “the pick of England.” Well,
the pick of England may mean much or little. In Union
Rugby it would mean nothing ; but the Northern Union
does get some of the brawn of the nation into its sport, and
the chances are that in this case “ the pick ” means a good
deal. The team is said to be particularly fast, and to in-
clude men who have kicked up some dust on the running
tracks in a quiet way. This inclusion of professional
runners is a good scheme if the team has been brought
up to make use of them properly. Many years ago
the old Monticillo Club in Dunedin included two
professional runners, Skitch and Noell, and when in the
field the other 13 players simply played to feed these two
flyers, who always ran together and passed one to another.
The result was that the Monticillo crowd, which was
largely composed of blacksmiths and other iron workers,
became great and terrific. It stamped all teams flat and
raged like a heathen, and so horrific did its reputation
become that the small kids were scared into being good
by the threat to send them to be eaten by the Monticillo
roughs. But it wasn’t their roughness that cut the ice ;
it was their two fast runners and the loyal action of the
rest of the team in sacrificing all individual opportunities
to let the two flyers loose.

Presbyterian Parson Crawford, who ran
Alligator Johnson to a head in the Lang elector-
ate (N.S.W.), is receiving requests from all over
the State to tight country seats at the State elec-
tions. The parson, however, encouraged by the
big majorities he received in the Marrickville end
of Lang, doesn’t see any reason at present for
quitting that electorate next September. At pre-
sent. Marrickville is represented by one McCoy,
a “Liberal” ; but he has decided that he doesn t
feel well enough to contest the seat.
Maorilander Tom Wilford, Wellington’s
new Mayor, has seen a lot of public life since he
cried his way into the world 40 years ago. He
was barely 21 when he was admitted to the Bar,
and, despite a pile of other jobs, he has estab-
lished a strong practice as a criminal pleader.
At 30 he battled into Parliament, and has stayed
there ever since, and for some time has been
Chairman of Committees. In spite of that, and
his practice, and a few odd jobs as a member of
local bodies, he found time hanging so heavily on
his hands that he became Chairman of the Wel-
lington Harbor Board. Now that he has also
become Mayor, he has reluctantly decided that
something will have to go overboard. The some-
thing will be the Chairmanship of Committees—
at least, he says so at present. His hobbies are
racehorses and popularity.
Miller, Bathurst’s quaint member (the
“Liberal” who asks for further support because
he voted against the party he belongs to more
than any other “Liberal”), is responsible for the
dictum that Bathurst —ancient, stagnant, land-
locked Bathurst—was “ not yet ripe” for closer
settlement. The m&n who that should he n

A London periodical recalls George Caley.
one of the earliest of Australian botanists. As a
boy Caley was an enthusiast in Lancashire, and
Banks got him a billet in Kew Gardens. He
came to Australia by the Speedy with Governor
King, and in 1800 was made superintendent.of the
new Botanic Garden at Parramatta. I* roi.n^ t hei e
he made excursions inland, and with Lnsign
Barrallier went as far afield as Western Port,
in Victoria. Afterwards lie explored the Hnwkes-
bury, and also made desperate attempts to get
over the Blue Mountains : but, apparently, his
party didn’t have the requisite pluck. Still, he
found the divide between the Gros.e and the
Hawkesbury. Later on, he made a second
attempt on the mountains, and put up a cairn
near YVoodford, which was named by Macquarie
Caley’s Repulse. Leaving Australia, he became
superintendent of the Botanic Garden at St.
Vincent, in the West Indies.

which is not a medicine that
merely gives temporary re-
lief, Scott’s Emulsion per-

May, 1909, from 52, Cowper
Street, Waverley, Sydney,
My daughter, aged two years, ivoidd
barely eat enough to keep her alive She
became almost too weak to stand, and

her vitality was so low that she
ivanted to do nothing but

Emulsion for two days, her

THESE illustrations show the first treatment of the raw materials in the course of their metamorphosis into
Beale Pianos. Australian pig iron has been carefully mixed and fiuxed in the cupola, and is being poured
into the moulds, from which it will come forth as fine castings of the iron frame with Beale-Vader patent
wrest-plate. The frames will be tested, and the slightest fault will cause them to be thrown back into the
melting-pot. Those which come through the test are then passed on from one set of skilled workmen to another
to be polished, drilled and fitted with the patent pins which constitute the Beale-Vader patent tuning system.
It is the only positive and scientific system, yet invented.
In the Mill the rough planks which have come from the saws are cut, planed and shaped to the
necessary sizes and requirements—the requirements in a piano are many and various—and are then passed on
to be built up in cross-plies, veneered and french-polished, going through many processes and many skilled
hands in their journey to perfection. The first conjunction of wood and metal is that of the back and the iron
frame. Everything else is built on to these. How successfully we have built is shown in the award of the
Franco-British Exhibition (London, 1908) Grand Prix, Diploma of Honor, and two Gold Medals for every kind of
excellence that should distinguish pianos and piano manufacture, and in the fact that over 13,000 Beale Pianos
are now in use throughout the Commonwealth.

Kidston’s Home Secretary, Appel, evi-
dently lias a most persuasive way with him.
During - the recent campaign not one Labor man
visited Allumbah, on the North Queensland table-
land ; but Appel harangued the district in the
interests of the Fuse. And when the results were
made up the triumph of Appel showed ud in this
magnificent way: Bamford (Labor), 205; Craw-
ford (Fuse), 8.
The Oaks, a new mining camp in the
North, has been struck by a squall of typhoid. A
solitary nurse there is in charge of 22 cases in the
school-room, which has been turned into a tem-
porary hospital. Ten deaths have happened since
the outbreak Started ; and as The Oaks is a very
primitive township, there wasn’t a sufficient
supply of coffin-timber on hand, wherefore some
of the bodies had to go to the dust without the
con ventionaL overcoat.
When the Bananalander read his breakfast
rag the other clay he found that his Ex. Mac-
gregor, returning from a northern tour, had called
in at Port Clinton. Then the average Banana-
ander thought hard, but couldn’t remember Port
Clinton. As a matter of fact, it pushes itself into
the land near Mackay. It still owns a wharf, but
otherwise not as much even as a darkie’s gunyah.
There are pnly two things to remember it by : it
once owned a fish-canning industry; and Flin-
ders, in the way-back days, went on shore there
and chopoed some wood. Heaven only knows
what Macgregor wanted there. He couldn’t
have been after firewood for the missus, because
Flinders carried off all that he cut. Perhaps he was
anxious to hear what noise a choked industry
makes when it is gurgling for High Protection.
The other day a Brisbane Bench was hit by
what looked like the final answer to a charge of
furious language : the young man’s father bustled
up and confided to the Court that the poor boy
was dumb—all on account of scarlet fever. It
seemed to amuse the assortment of constables on
hand; and after one or two of them had given
their version of the young man’s eloquence,
the young man himself remarked to the
Bench that he would plead guilty. After
that, somebody else remembered that the
young man had been fined for a previous
crop of flowers of language ; and that apparently
was new-; to the old man. In fact, it obviously so
staggered him that the Bench evidently recon-
sidered things and let him go without asking him
what he meant by it all.
Fortuna.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HE rides a steed of milky hue
O’er hedge and lea and boulder;
There streams.a band of crimson silk
Behind her flashing shoulder.
And he who grips the crimson band
And stays the dashing bearer,
If he but hold it firm and fast
May kiss the lovely wearer.
A gallant gives his steed the spur ;
His blood is madly boiling,
And all the while his comrades come
Behind him hotly toiling.
Away, away Fortuna flies ;
The further, still the dearer ;
Her fierce pursuer flogs his steed,
Yet never comes the nearer.
“ I’ll have her yet,” he panting vows,
“ No man shall get before me ;
I’ll seize her band and kiss her band
Though Judgment thunders o’er me !”
A fall—a cry ! He drops to die !
And, ’neath a bush so shady,
You see hard by—-with roguish eye—
Another kiss the lady !
QUEENSLAND.
F. BORN.
A SIMPLE PRESCRIPTION.
Said to Cure Rheumatism, Kidney Trouble and
Bladder Troubles.
We know that the readers of this paper appre-
ciate good advice, and we are glad, therefore, to
he able to publish the following from a prominent
physician.
It is astonishing to know the prevalence of
kidney trouble and other diseases, such as rheu-
matism, bladder and liver troubles, which are
almost invariably caused by l weak kidneys. It is
said on good authority that fully one-third of the
people in Australia who have reached the age of
maturity are mcye or less afflicted with kidney
trouble in some form. The most dangerous feature
of this disease is the fact that many people have it
without their knowledge, and consequently neglect
it until it has reached a dangerous stage.
The least symptom of kidney trouble, such as
backache, must be given prompt attention, and a
good reliable treatment shook! be taken, until
every trace of the disease has been eliminated.
We are glad to be able to give our readers a pre-
scription which we have seldom known to fail in
any case. It contains no harmful ingredients, is
pleasant to take, not expensive, and can be sup-
plied by an v good chemist. It is as follows
Tincture Gentian Compound, one ounce; Syrup
Rhubarb, one ounce ; Liquid Barkola Compound,
one ounce; Syrup of Ginger, five ounces.
Take a teaspoonful after each meal, and one at
bed-time.
We are glad to publish this prescription, as we
know it will help our afflicted readers who give it
a fair trial. If taken continuously for a few
weeks it will be found to be an almost absolutely
certain cure for Rheumatism, Kidney and Bladder
trouble. Backache and all allied complaints.
Note.—Other papers are privilegd to copv the
above. A i >VT.
Wild pigs have recently become a perfect
pest in parts of North Bananaland. At Marathon,
on the Flinders, there are hundreds of them, and
in order to reduce the grunt a bonus of fid. per
scalp is now offered. Who says pork ?
Queensland Judges of late days have got
into the habit of talking a great deal about “con-
tempt”; but, like most people who talk much,
they do little—which is just as well. Recently
one Puisne had an idea evidently that he ought
to lock up the Commissioner of Police. The
chief Robert had diverted heavy traffic so as to
send it past the Supreme Court ; and his Honor
broke off proceedings to rasp out that it was just
as well all and sundry were informed that he
had the power to send the Sheriff forth to
grab Punch by the winkers and order Gee-
whoa to be still. A little before that outburst
another Judge said to an Acting-Crown Prose-
cutor—“ Look closely into the law of contempt.
Mr. ; for I have the power to send you to
Boggo Road Gaol.” This explosion happened
because the Acting C.P., under the belief that he
would have plenty of time while the jury in a
previous case were out, had not drawn the indict-
ment in the following case at the moment that
the prisoner was hustled into the dock. Still
another Judge threatened to commit a man who
came into Court with a pair of creaky boots. As
all these learned brothers say, they have the
power they talk about. Their trouble is that
they know they wouldn’t have it if they
exercised it.
SOMETHING FOR THE WAITER.
LEG-PULLING SPORT: “ A tip? Cer
tainly. Cannonball for the Cup."
The scale pest that was heralded with
great joy recently as the coming destroyer of the
priekly-pear. has turned out to be a false alarm.
The entomologist states that the blight was
nothing more than a condition due to the curse
having absorbed all the available potash and
lime, whereupon it had partly ceased operations
pending another supply.
“S. S. Severn”: Brown brother has a
rooted objection to dying in bed. At one time
the Torres Strait hospital used to surround him
with clean, white sheets, but they scared him
so that he escaped unanimously to die under a
palm tree on the beach. The institution com-
promised by building a shed and furnishing it
with fibre mats on a sand floor, and with a cement
centre-piece, so that Brownie could swelter in the
smoke he loves, and pass in his soul as it suited
his convenience.
A while ago the artisans and shop
assistants who have had the impertinence to push
themselves into Brisbane’s very naicest suburbs
of Indooroopilly, Sherwood and Corinda, pre-
sented a petition asking for a reduction of the
high train-fares to those parts. The document
was scarcely perched in a railway pigeon-hole
before the earls, viscounts, and pig merchants of
the same parts dropped in a counter-petition,
asking that the impertinent persons’ requests
should be disregarded and the fares kept up.
Why, with reduced fares some foundry-fellow—
like the Premier—might come and pollute the
pig, merchant’s atmosphere. But the fares haven’t
been reduced ; so the pig merchants are safe.
Eighteen months ago the Brisbane gas-
stokers were granted a Wages Board, which since
then has been dawdling along like a lame emu.
The other day the union waited upon Minister
Barnes and requested that the Board’s jurisdic-
tion should be extended to cover all other
workers connected with the industry, bar office
workers. The Phidston mouthpiece replied by
merely standing first on one foot and then on the.
other. Meanwhile the very bloated gas cos. are
fighting the proposal like a bagful of cats. In the
course of the remarks that have been made on the
subject, it transpired that Private Enterprise was
paying its lamp-lighters a colossal 15s. a week ;
and Minister Barnes, far from gasping when the
information was conveyed to him, began to hunt
for excuses for old Enterprise. He didn’t wish to
argue that 15s. a week was an ample wage, but —
etc., etc. The shock that Phidston’s system re-
ceived over the Commonwealth elections may lift
things a hit for the workers in Queensland, but
the only sure lift will come when Phidston is the
passenger.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. May 7, 1910.
Mt Dear Thargomindah,—
Brisbane hung itself with black and purple on
Saturday; and, with the notable exception of
Tattersall’s Club, which ran a poorly-attended
meet, all sports and amusements were called off.
As things turned out, Tattersall’s would have
been better advised had it called off too.
Almost the last semi-public act of the dead
King was to receive at the hands of Agent-General
Robinson the pearlshell and gold ink-stand sent
as a memento of Queensland’s Jubilee. Already,
Edward was under sentence of death ; the doctors
had told him of his critical condition. Yet he in-
sisted upon keeping the appointment with Queens-
land’s representative, and talked of the State’s
fisheries and its mines.
Kidston’s stocks have fallen so low that the
entire crop is frostbitten ; and as the political
barometer shows no sign of improved conditions,
the Liberal gardeners are considering the best
means of transplanting the withering vegetable
to Federal fields. The present suggestion is that
Edwards, who won the Oxley seat, should retire
in favor of Ividston. and that the Liberal League
should “make it worth the Premier’s while.”
Ividston is said to be willing to face the Oxley
electors, and otherwise carry through this
arrangement.
Whoever gets the seat on the Supreme Court
Bench vacated by Justice Power last week, it will
not be O’Sullivan ; but there is a chance that he,
will presently wear horse-tail on the District
Court Bench. Meanwhile a noble army of lawyers
and barristers are fighting over Power’s billet.
15. M. Lilley and Peter Macgregor are each said
to be in the running.
In rny wanderings I struck a ship with an un-
spellabie name, and on its passenger list Thk
Bulletin's Akenehi, bound, so far as I could
make out, for the wilds of the Indian Ocean.
The ship was hove-to at Pihkenba, and the air
thereabouts proved strong enough to assist the
trippers to dress and propel themselves into Jown,
where they ate a very badlv-served lunch in the
gardens. From the Pinkenba wharf, close by, the
giant Orvieto took aboard a host of travellers, in-
cluding the Wiilcocks. mother and daughters, two
of them bound fogwards and one to Sydney, and
Mr. and Mrs. Craig, who will put in the winter
in N. S. Wales. The same vessel brought back
wanderers of the clan McConnel. Prior to the
Wiilcocks’ departure the family mansion opened
its doors on Eight-Hour Day to a multitude of
good-bye sayers. who ate good things on the lawn
and kissed the bride-to-be. An upper room was
strewn with offerings, from which it may be
gathered that Dr. Lucas is not only acquiring a
very popular bride, but also a quantity of valuable
bric-a-brac. Next day, the James Clark lady
held revel atWyhenia; and another regiment of
shes, in their newest hats, were tea-cupped at the
New Pioneer rooms, along with Katherine Grey
and Mrs. Winter Hall. You could hardly seethe
guests for roses.
This outburst of junketting being highly con-
tagious, Ministers succumbed to the epidemic,
and took a day off in a body, along with wives,
daughters, lunch-baskets, reporters, and other
paraphernalia for the wilds of Canungera, a spot
that sits permanently and lonely at the foot of
Tambourine, calling for railway communication
with the city. It ;s where the butter boxes come
from, and, incidentally, some of the finest farm
produce in the State. The visitors gambolled
over the rival routes of the proposed iron way,
camped under canvas, lunched, dinnered, and
tea’d, until, becoming entirely reckless, the
Minister for Railways so far forgot himself as to
promise a trial survey right away. As a grand
finale the inhabitants held a concert, at which
Kidston said a piece, and Home Sec. Appel sang
a ballad. Miss Mabel Brady made a debut on the
same occasion with a carefully polished product
of vocal chords.
Meanwhile the clan MacGregor was exploring
the wilds of Longreach, where the local folk had
arranged high revels, and where Mrs. Gilbert
Wilson, in some stunning gowns, backed up by
the tuneful-fingered Elaine Feez and various
other musicians, gave two high-priced and well-
attended concerts. The vice-regal party visited
the State schools, where his Ex. set sums, and the
convent, where he acquired an address of welcome.
The Curfew bell having been gently dropped by
Kidston on the toes of the good ladies of Bris-
bane’s purity brigade, they might turn their atten-
tion to something useful. Why not take a hand
in the removal of the superfluous Lady from
around the University area? She’s a dead too
thick there at present.
A girleen of the Innes-Noid family struck
Brisbane last week, and to her belongs the honor
of introducing to the community its first Chante-
cler headpiece. It's a cobalt blue rooster, re-
posing above the wearer’s nose. The latter is
nicely chiselled, and the bird goes well with it.
Among the week’s parties, the Cecil Palmers’
anniversary gathering was one of the smartest;
and there was a little spree on the south side, run
by two popular maidens, that is said to have
resulted in a double engagement.
Following up a lately-acquired bad habit, I
wandered to Boonah this week, where much
p ough horse, pig and cow were gathered together
to be admired. Boonah is one of the most
beautiful spots in the State, a farm-dotted valley
girded with wonderful blue hills. Its prosperity
and tourist popularity some day is assured ; but,
alas ! the railway service is for the present so in-
convenient and ill-timed that hardly a tourist
ventures that way.
Talking of the tourist. 307 of him landed here
bv the Wyreema on Thursday, bound for the
palmy North, and I hear of extra ships being put
on to cope with the business during the winter
months. I wonder how many will trip as far as
the Ohillagoe caves and the hot springs, among
tiie best-worth-seeing sights we possess.
Mrs. Mason hostessed the Katherine Grey lady
one day last week at a tuneful gathering, where
Mrs. Hooper, of Sydney, warbled in three
tongues. A youthful soprano (a pupil of the
hostess), Miss E. Davidson and Mrs. Frances
(who was once bonny Molly O’Brien) took a hand
in the successful programme.
Yours affectionately, Mario.
The wheels of justice could do with a bit
of axle-grease up North occasionally. Compen-
sation applied for by the widow of Charles Dennis
was asked through the Clermont court from
Malvern Downs station on December 12, 1907.
After dodging one hundred and one technical
points, the applicant’s solicitor received the £280
due on April 22, 1910. This paper hopes that
Peter won’t keep the boss of Malvern Downs
waiting outside for an answer that long. Still
Peter is supposed to have a pretty good memory,
so it may cheer up the boss of Malvern Downs to
reflect that Peter may do it even without this
paper suggesting it.

“ Machete ” : Strange are the ways of the
Papuan cook-boy. He disdains absurd conven-
tion in the matter of cleaning game and fish prior
to serving, and, even after years of education, he
is prone to consider a hurried wipe with the
corner of his dirty sulu all that is needful for
plate cleaning. One genius of this sort once made
the writer his morning cocoa from a tin of carbolic
powder. The chef iVoeuvre of every Papuan cooky
is “a curry.” It is made up of the contents of
every tin in the cookhouse. He is fond of starting
a damp fire with kerosene—worth about 10s. per
tin—and as a consequence palm-leaf cookhouses
are not worth insuring in Papua. One came to
the writer in glee recently, with a basket of hens’
eggs he had found in the grass. After the first
was opened, the find was hastily bestowed on him.
“ Me eat’m,” he said, joyfully. And he did.

THE Company is being formed for the purpose of purchasing and carrying on the business of
The A.8.C., Limited, of No. 189 and No. 156 Pitt Street, together with the Catering and
Hiring-out Departments, including the business of Miss Bishop, now being conducted at
87 King Street, and The Arcade, Milson’s Point, with the Bakeries and Stores of both
businesses, situated at 172 A Pitt Street, and Bridge Road, Forest Lodge, as from 31st March last.
The Two Concerns have for years been successful Profit-Earning Enterprises, and with additional
Capital and the wider interest which will accrue by allowing the public to participate in the profits,
even better Dividends should result.
The Principal Tea and Dining Rooms of the Company at 189 Pitt Street are without doubt the
finest rooms in the Commonwealth, and their location is such that the best class of trade is assured to
this Company on account of its position.
The Company is acknowledged to be in the front rank of High-class Caterers and Manufacturers,
and is Caterer by Appointment to His Excellency the Governor-General and several of the leading
Clubs.
In addition to the businesses of the Aerated Bread Company, Ltd., and Miss Bishop, the Old
Company has purchased the well-known Business and Lease of Wylie’s Caf4 at the corner of the
Corso and the South Steyne. Manly, which will be included in the Sale to the New Company. Tnis
is the best position in Manly for a Branch of the Company’s business. The Directors of the Company'
have in view very suitable central premises for Branch to take the place of 156 Pitt Street, the
Lease of which expires on 30th September next.
Amongst the assets taken over is a block of freehold land at Paddington, near Rushcutters Bay,
consisting of 3i acres, and as the Company’s consumption of bread is already very large, it is proposed
to erect on this site an up-to-date Bread Factory of first-class design, with the most modern Machinery
and Plant to provide for daily delivery of their Bread to the Public.
The Company will pay for the whole of the Assets taken over the sum of £33,500, payable
C 18,500 in Cash, and 15,000 Fully Paid Shares of £1 each.
These Assets consist of —
Plant, Machinery, Furniture Fittings, etc., valued by Mr. H. Y. Norton,
Expert Valuator, Pitt Street, at... ... ... ... ... ... £9897 910

As may be seen from the Certificate of Messrs. Kent, Brierley and Sully, Public Accountants, the
Annual Net Profits of the Businesses for the Three Years and Six Months, ending 31st March, 1910,
have averaged £4356 6s. Bd. per annum, after making provision for Depreciation and Wear and Tear.
The services of the Manager of the A.8.C., Ltd., and also of Miss Bishop, have been retained by
the Company.
Applications for Shares will be dealt with as far as possiWein order of priority, and the Company
will be declared formed when 10,000 Shares have been applied for.
All expenses of Flotation, including Brokerage, will be borne try the Vendors.
The Certificate of Messrs. Kent, Brierley and Sully referred to is as follows, viz. :
THE DIRECTORS, THE AERATED BREAD COMPANY, LIMITED.
Dear Sirs, —We have examined the Books of the Aerated Bread Company. Limited,
Caterers, etc., of Pitt Street, for a period of three years and six months ending 31st March,
1910. We have also examined the Books of Miss Bishop, who has carried on a somewhat
similar business to the Aerated Bread Company, Limited., at 87 King Street, and Milson’s
Point, for a similar period. We understand that it is your intention to combine the two
businesses, and our investigation shows that the average net profit for the term under investi-
gation was £4356 6s. Bd. per annum, equal to 12'44 per cent, on a capital of £35,000. In
September, 1909. Miss Bishop discontinued supplying the Civil Service Co-operative Society,
Ltd., and since then has been supplying the public direct, with satisfactory results. Had it not
been for a loss made by the branch of the Aerated Bread Company, Limited, at No. 156 Pitt
Street, the occupancy of which premises, we understand, you are discontinuing at the 30th
September next, the profits would have been still more satisfactory.

EDISON AMBEROL RECORDS
are the Records that play four minutes —the
longest playing Records in existence, of
unusual beauty, purity and accuracy.
They can be played by any Edison
Phonograph by means of an attach-
ment which makes it possible to
play either the Amberol (four-
minute) or the Standard (two-minute)
Records at will. Any Edison Phono-
graph you have may be equipped
with the Amberol attachment so as
to play both, and all new Phono-
graphs have the attachment.
REMEMBER that every Edison Phono-
graph which plays the Amberol Records also
plays the two-minute Records.
Whether you enjoy grand opera or
any of the other good music which
can be had in the form of Edison
Records, whether you like Peter
Dawson or some of the other great
singers, whatever your taste and
whatever use you have for a Phono-
graph, it will pay you to go to your
dealer and hear the Edison Phono-
graph play Edison Records.
Don’t buy any sound-reproducing instrument
until you have heard the Edison play an
Amberol Record.
Edison Phonographs are sold at the
same prices everywhere in Australia,
from £2/12/6 upwards.
Edison Standard Records, 1/3.
Edison Amberol Records (play
twice as long), 2/■»
There are Edison dealers every-
where. Go to the nearest and hear
the Edison Phonograph play both
the Edison Standard and Amberol
Records, and get complete cata-
logues from your dealer or from us.

THE SIGN OF THE SERPENT, by J. H. M. Abbott,
Author of “Tommy Cornstalk,” “ Letters from
Queer Street.”
Illustrated Paper Cover, 1/- (postage 3d.).
Something sensational? Well, this should
satisfy the most exacting in that direction. A
secret society, instituted in England in the
smuggling days of “ The Georges,” has the scene
of its operations transferred to Australia, where
the descendants of the smugglers happen to be.
A priceless jewel, in the form of a serpent
encrusted with precious stones, that has been
the sign of the society for three generations, is
coveted by the remaining members, and there is
lots of trouble before the ownership is definitely
settled. There is much scheming and shedding
of blood ; while Cupid, in his usual irresistible
way, decides the vexed question to the satisfac-
tion of all concerned. And how? Well, it is
worth while to find out ; and you won’t be dis-
appointed. Mr. Percy F. S. Spence is responsible
for the illustrations, and that means a lot.
ON AN AUSTRALIAN FARM, by “Steele Rudd,"
Author of “ On Our Selection,” “ The Poor
Parson,” “Duncan McClure," etc.
Illustrated Paper Cover, price 1/- (post free, 1/3).
This is “ Steele Rudd’s ” latest, and in it we are
introduced to a higher circle of Bushdom—the
Australian farm. The struggling selector gives
place to the prosperous farmer, and one feels
more inclined to enjoy the many humorous
situations, knowing that “ the farmer can afford
it.” The same rollicking fun pervades this book
that obtained in the Selection Series, for Mr.
Davis’s keen sense of humor is his best asset, and
he distributes largesse with a generous hand. Few
authors have such a host of friends all over
Australia, and bis “ Australian Farm ” must win
him many more. There are numerous illustra-
tions from the facile pen of Mr. Ben Jordan,
whose work is always appreciated.

“A.V.”: Press night in a country newspaper office.
Two weary-looking compositors and a sleepy “devil”
move languidly about the galvanised-iron room. Three
kerosene lamps shed a feeble light on the scene. The
editor sits in a rickety chair inside a fenced-off hessian
enclosure, facing a table that shakes as if it had the jim-
jams. Around him are scattered exchanges, proofs and
evil-smelling paste.
The clock points to 2 a.m.
“ Measured-up yet?” he shouts at large.
“ Yes ; and want about half a column.”
“ Blast it! Stick in a couple of dummies.”
“ Can’t; measured three already.”
“ Brrr! ”
The editor grabs an exchange. Presently he grasps
the scissors and clips a paragraph.
“ If you can scrape up enough pica, set it up in that,
and give a piece to Jimmy.” Jimmy is the devil.
After much cursing and shaking, Jimmy is aroused
from his slumbers on the pile of waste-paper. Soon the
clicking of type is the only sound heard.
3.30 a.m.—The foreman brings the mallet down with
vigorous strokes on top of the planer. The chase
buckles, and a stick of brevier becomes a hopeless wreck.
Curses. Then, while Jimmy holds a spluttering lamp
over the forme, the damage is slowly repaired. At last
all is ready, just as the editor rushes towards the press.
“Blazes! You haven’t set up that lost-horse ad.,
and it was paid for in advance.”
More cursing.
4 a.m.—Once again the forme is locked up. The noise
made by the ancient Albion press would arouse half the
inhabitants of the cemeiery if they weren't used to it.
The first sheet is grasped by the editor, who hastily scans
its contents, and then lays it down with a sigh of relief.
“Let her go.” And Jimmy grasps the ink roller.
One hour later he wanders out of the front door with a
bundle of papers under his arm, while the two composi-
tors place the damp, unprinted sheets under the boards
on the floor. They close the doors and walk towards the
nearest pub to look up a couple of early beers.

Ada Reeve, playing Jack in a “ Beanstalk” pantomime,
has been mixed up with a misprint which has shocked
Birmingham (Eng.). She had a comic cow called Jess,
and the Birmingham Post, at the end of the panto,
season, praised Ada and Jess about equally. But the
printer dropped a superfluous “ U” into the name of the
animal! The things that were said when the discovery
was made singed the office-devil’s tail.

Stumm, who tried to oust Fisher from Wide Bay (Q.),
is a Gympie editor. One of his old political foes dropped
in on him the other day to remind him of a leader he
wrote when Andy Fisher was asking Gympie to
allow him to be an alderman. Fisher, at that time, was
a Sunday-school teacher, and Stumm ventured to print
that, however capable Fisher was at running a bun
struggle or school picnic, he was overreaching himself in
attempting for aldermanic laurels.

“The Patriarch”: Apropos Sydney Mail (B. 21/4/’10).
Originally, The Mail was published at fourpence ; but
about 35 years ago the Fairfaxes raised it to sixpence,
thinking it of as much value as the T. and C. Journal,
which it was not. The latter paper responded with
vigorous booming by Henniker Heaton in every town of
N.S.W. But there was no Henniker on the Mail’s
premises, and the paper lost money for the Fairfaxes for
many a year thereafter.

The battle for advertisement between the Adelaide
newspapers raged hotly at the last two elections—
State and Federal. On polling night of the State con-
tests the Register provided a free magic-lantern exhibi-
tion, the screen showing photographs of the various
candidates. Further down the street the new Labor
daily entertained the crowd with a brass-band concert.
Evidently the Advertiser was taken by surprise, because
there was nothing doing there ; but the old lady woke
up on Federal election night, and blossomed into a cine-
matograph show.
* * * *
The murder of the unfortunate child Phillips, at Wil-
loughby (Sydney), provided the “great” organs with
some blood-curdling subjects for illustration. The D.T.
showed the hut in which the murdered girl had lived,
with two uniformed police and some sleuth-hounds on the
trail. In a footnote the reader was informed that the
cross on the right marked the spot where the blanket was
burnt. In another picture was shown the hole in the
ground where the body was buried ; and, on the right,
the branch of a geebung tree Which led to the discovery
of the grave where the murderer buried his victim. It
all goes to showlhe perfection to which the art of jour-
nalism may be raised by even one great daily, provided
its editor has enjoyed the privilege of having had a Uni-
versity degree conferred upon him.

“D.M.W.”: I read that the New York Herald uses
up 11 acres of virgin forest in the wood-pulp paper of its
daily issue. It sounds like a lie ; but if one acre is used
up it is a tolerably serious business, considering the
number of papers that hunt the same game. Loss of
forests means loss of moisture, which means loss of
bread; so it may be that the big, stodgy morning prints
of the world are doing more injury to this planet than
even the perusal of their leading articles would lead one
to suppose.
On the 13th ult. there occurred in the U.K., unless a
lot of plans went wrong, a revolution in the book-publish-
ing tnde. On th itdateThomasNelson and Sonsintended
to start publishing new novels of the sort that formerly
cost 6s. at 2s. The three books due to appear on April 11
are by H. G. Wells, Anthony Hope and J, C. Snaith re-
spectively. Later, G. F. Benson, John Buchan, “Q.,”
Bea.rice Harraden, Hilaire Belloc and other front-rankers
are to see the light at half a dollar. The publishers claim
that they are doing this as a matter of literary patriotism,
and because the novel has c -me to be to the latter-day
Briton what the ballad was to the populace in the days
when only the monks knew how to read. A likelier ex-
planation is that the change looks like paying.
HYMN TO INK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Some chant of goddesses and gods,
Of nymphs and fays and elves ;
Some sing of dryads and of gnomes,
Some of themselves;
But I—l hymn the everlasting praise
Of my black love and my sweet love :
Ink, the kind angel of my days !
Some mourn in dirges for the dead,
Some Fate apostrophise,
And some their heart’s eternal woes
Thus advertise ;
But I—l hymn the everlasting praise
Of my good love and my sweet love :
Ink, the bright angel of my days !
The sable empress of my life,
In her my soul I dip ;
And she, responsive to the touch,
Brings to the lip
Words that shall win me everlasting praise.
Oh, my dear love and my sweet love :
Ink, the good angel of my days!
Black beauty that anoints the page
That some day—some day soon—
Shall thrill the careless earth and sky,
The sun and moon ;
Shall fling to Heaven my everlasting praise
Oh, my true love and my brave love :
Ink, the strong angel of my days 1
Still, oh my fluent queen, not yet
Have you brought me to print;
There lurks, to thwart, an awful wretch,
A callous flint;
A fiend who keeps afar ray rightful bays ;
My cruel foe and my hard foe—
An Editor—ill genius of my days !

NO more positive proof of the worthiness of an Alcock ” billiard table could
be giveu tiiau by the splendid performance of George Gray, the young
Queensland player, in his recent match with Fred Lindrum, jun.
A Standard “Alcock” Billiard Table was used, and certified to by the
Amateur Billiard Association of Victoria (which is affiliated with the Billiard
Association of Great Britain and Ireland).
Gray, who made 830—831 coming off the red—used Crystallite balls, and the
marvellous accuracy with which they came off the cushions, the ease with which
the most difficult shots were accomplished, speaks for itself of the merit and
superiority of " Alcock” Billiard Tables.

“MY OPTICIANS,”

Opticians and Electricians s
393 GEORGE STREET,
FACING
KOVAL HOTEL,
SYDNEY.
The Maoriland Government has decided
to send a representative to the Argentine Exhibi-
tion with a collection of exhibits. Why? What
trade can IO U Ward hope for? Hitherto
nothing much has been sent that way except
choice stock to help the country to breed better
shhejj) and thus cut deeper into the Australasian
frozen meat trade. Argentina is a land where the
Dago farmer can produce most things dirt cheap,
and there does not seem to be much in giving him
points. There are, however, two possible ex-
planations. Either Joseph feels that he is being
neglected these last few months and must have
advertisement somewhere and somehow, or e.se
there is some dear friend of the Liberal Cabinet
who wants a little excursion at the country’s
expense.
“ D.,” re the sanctity of certain Roots:—
I happened recently to mention a friend’s name in the
hearing of Macßrose—Macßrose, who wears a black tail
coat and bowler hat on the Sabbath, is a victim to dys-
pepsia, a believer in the Menace of Socialism, a member
of five different Leagues or Combines to preserve the
Empire from disruption, and in general an almost blatant
Eight Thinker. Thereupon Macßrose used a phrase that
has often exercised me. He said, with cold scorn : “ The
scoundrel! I wouldn't allow him beneath my roof lt
has a fine expansive sound. It conjures up visions of
rare treasures hidden jealously from the unworthy and
the irreligious. I used to conceive Macßrose’s roof as an
almost divine structure under which worldlings were
for ever trying to crawl and for ever being repulsed by
Macßrose on the score of immorality or lax attendance
at kirk or something.
Then came a day of disillusionment when I got there
myself. Sojourn beneath the roof did not appeal to me.
The furniture over which it looms is incredibly new and
hideous, and unnaturally hard. One is haunted by a
dread that a fellow-visitor, flinging himself carelessly on to
one of the razor-hacked lounges, may lash out the word
“ D—n " or worse, and straightway be driven forth by
Macßrose, shamed utterly and with an injured spine.
The roof shields some of the most poisonous cigars I
have encountered. The conversation of Macßrose, of
which the roof has a surfeit, is pure but dull. It mostly
concerns triumphs in the tallow-broking line, scored by
Macßrose Over business rivals. The remainder of it deals
chiefly with the deplorable doings and low moral
characters of his acquaintances.
Macßrose and his roof are not lone individual cases.
They are types. All over the ;C6mmonwealth you will
find excitable, aggressively-upright persons feverishly
determined to keep people from getting under their
roofs. The roof appears with them to be a sort of fetich.
It,must be kept uncontaminated at any cost. It is to
them what the lares and penates were to the .early
1 Womans, what the mosque floor is to the M diommedan,
"joat his toothbrush is to the fastidious modern. One of
the ghastliest social tragedies I ever witnessed arose from
the admission, by an error, of a Federal Labor member
the roof of Macßrose. Macßrose had mistaken
the Laborite for aJ. K I shall never forget the. denoue-
ment when the truth came out. The discovery by Oiesar
of his wife being publicly arrested for drunkenness, in-
sulting conduct and tearing the Roman force’s uniform
couldn’t have been more painful. I don’t know what
Macßrose did to the roof afterwards. lam sure he dis-
infected it at once. More probably he had it torn down
and a new and unpolluted one substituted.
“Gideon” : I’ve heard much queer law-
jargon one way and another, and when the charge
of sedition was read against Harry Holland, at
Albury last year, 1 came to the conclusion ; that I
had arrived .-it the limit. I still think so. That
charge took Justice Brings associate about half
an hour to get through, and every now and then
he’d make the most horrible facial contortions- in
order to keep from bursting into wild hilarity.
Was greatly interested, therefore, to see a copy
of; the plain, straightforward indictment in. the
prosecution of the American Meat Trust gang at
New York—a prosecution which may or may not
come to anything more than a pyramid of Costs,
unless it is two pyramids. The defendants (who
include two representatives of Messrs. Armour
and three of Messrs. Swift and Co.) are charged
that they
did wilfully, unlawfully, immorally, fraudulently, ex-
lortionately, knowingly and corruptly combine; unite',
confederate arid conspire for their own unjust, excessive,
extortionate, exorbitant, immoral, and unlawful gain and
profit, by the power of their numbers and wealth, their
greed and cunning-, and their divers subtle, immoral,
dishonest, collusive, coercive, unlawful- contrivances,
methods and compacts to raise, enhance and increase the
prices of meat and poultry to the public.
Now, a man charged with that can’t complain
that he doesn’t understand it, nor take up the
stand an accused did some time ago in Sydney. In
that case a charge about a furlong in extent was
read at 'the unfortunate prisoner, to which he
listened much a,s a Chinaman might listen to a
recital of “ Paradise Regained ” in Esperanto.
When it was, finished he requested that it should
be read again. This was done by order of the
Judge. Once more the mystified man begged that
the long rigamarole might be repeated for the
third time. Again the Judge’s associate, who by
this time was hoarse, arrived at the question,
“How do you plead, prisoner—guilty or not
guilty?” The prisoner spat on his hands.
"Guilty and chance it !” he said.
The punishment handed Out to the be-
nighted heathen, when he is unlucky enough to
cause trouble to the Power that bosses his bit of
jungle, is generally a bombardment at long range
»iy a warship. It is a pathetically futile business ;
Joseph Conrad, in his story, “ Heart of Dark-
ness,” describes how foolish a cruiser looks .whilst
lying off a coast methodically firing live shell at
a peaceful green forest. The French lately had
trouble with the niggers down in the New
Hebrides, and the hr,tie cruiser Kersaint that
occasionally visits Sydney went down there, and
from a distance of four miles pumped shell into a
native inilage. When the guns and gunners had
warmed themselves up nicely the firing ceased,
and an expedition was sent ashore, presumably to
look at the place and see what had been hit. " Of
course, the result of the bombardment wasn’t
stated in the press reports. In fact, one never
does see a list of the bag after these shoots. The
British Navy sometimes goes so far as to enumer-
ate the number of pigs killed by a Pacific punitive
expedition. But even those statements seem to
be published with reluctance; possibly some one
in authority has a haunting fear that an irreverent
person might arise and call the Service the Guild
<>f Pork Butchers.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in- appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache—a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE, a
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasioh, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.

Puketapu, on one of Maoriland’s
pleasant little habits:—
After a residence of many years in Maoriland, and a
close study of the inhabitants, I feel it incumbent upon
me to write about Rogues. There are more Rogues in
Maoriland to the square inch than in any other country,
I believe, in the world. For instance, every person who
arrives in M.L. is putdown by the inhabitants as a Rogue,
while they (the inhabitants) hasten to inform the stranger
that he has arrived at a country where there are no
Rogues— himself and other strangers, of course, ex-
cepted. Yet, while there are no Rogues in the country
(strangers excepted), the stranger will presently be
assured that all M.L. Governments for the past 30 years
have been mostly Rogues. Beginning with the Atkinson
Government (the Continuous Ministry), he will be told
that they were plain Rogues. When. George Grey made
his famous attack on them he declared that, amongst
they had “ rendered women and children
landless, squandered the revenues of the country, and
incurred great debts to give value to the property of
their friends, which had been taken from the
people.... had maintained at the public expense a
libellous newspaper to libel those who were op-
posed to them in politics... had allowed native lands
to be improperly acquired to a vast extent by friends
whom they favored, and had allowed the public land in
like manner to be taken.” The next Government was
that of John Ballance. He wasn’t much of a Rogue, it is
a 'kjwed ; but then, by way of explanation, it is generally
added that he hardly had time to be a Rogue before he
died. The next lot was under Seddon. Ido not know
what class he was in as a Rogue, but Bill Russell
(formerly Leader of the Opposition) and old Massey
(present Leader of the Opposition) used to nominate him
for IA. As for Seddon, he had his views concerning both
of them. At the present time Joe Ward runs the
Government, and there are quite a crowd of people who
tell the stranger what he is, too. If Ward is thrown out
of power, Massey will probably get office, and if he is not
a Rogue himself—well, * great part of M.L. is sure that
he is surrounded by awful Rogues. So that the place is
full of Rogues. In fact, the writer (who is a Rogue him-
self) is satisfied that Rogues are one of Maoriland’s
greatest natural resources. And yet, as I said before, the
stranger upon arrival is assured that there are no Rogues
in M.L. (strangers excepted). It is all very puzzling.

GROWING HAIR BY THE
CALENDAR.
ALL THE MATERIAL AND INSTRUCTIONS NECESSARY
FOR CARRYING OUT THIS VALUABLE TOILET
TEST SENT FREE BY REQUEST.
A week’s trial of “ Harlene Hair-Drill” con-
vinces everyone of the almost magical effect of
the new method in growing new hair upon bald
or thin patches, in restoring the lustre and
colour to grey or faded hair, in removing scurf,
in increasing the lustre and glossy luxuriance of
"Woman’s crowning glory.”
In one week “ Harlene Hair-Drill ” grows
beautiful hair.
Practise the rules for " Harlene Hair-Drill,” as
drawn up by Mr. Edwards, the eminent Royal
and Court Hair Specialist, and discoverer of
“ Harlene-for-the-Hair,” and you can literally
watch your hair growing thicker and lowger and
more beautiful. You can grow hair by the
calendar—a calendar only seven days long,
A SEVEN DAYS’ FREE TEST.
Hundreds of men and women are doing this at
the present moment. Troubled with Thin or Fall-
ing Hair, or attacked by Scurf or Premature Grev-
ness(and all greyness'is premature, seeing that
Hair-Drill enables the hair to Vetain its colour up
to old age), they have obtained one of the free
“Harlene Seven Days’Hair-Drill Trial Outfits”
(you can obtain one of these outfits yourself
free of all charge, by means of the coupon at the
foot of this article), and at the end of a week
their friends have congratulated them upon the
marvellous improvement in their appearance.
You can do the same yourself. Get one Of these
Trial Outfits —it will cost you nothing —and
practise “Harlene Hair-Drill’' for a couple of
minutes every morning. You begin directly
you receive your outfit (full directions will be
sent with each), and all the rest of the day you
will be conscious of a healthy and pleasant
influence at work on your scalp and at the roots
of your hair.
“ Harlene Hair-Drill ” only takes a couple of
minutes of the day, but its effect takes years off
your appearance. And as after the week’s trial
you will desire to continue this successful
method of Hair-Culture and Preservation, you
may like to know that further supplies of
“Harlene” may be obtained from ordinary
enterprising chemists or stores all over the world,
or it will be sent direct on receipt of postaj
order (to include postage) from the Edwards
Harlene Co., 95-6, High Ilolborn, London,
W.C., in Is., 2s. 6d., and 4s. 6d. bottles. A
FREE TRIAL COUPON.
To the EDWARDS’ HARLENE CO.,
95-96, Hiuh Holborn, London, England.
Dear Sirs,—Having read your article on “Growing Hair by the
Calendar,’'l should like to accept your offer to send me the week’s
Trial Outfit for “Harlene Hair-Drill ” free of charge. I enclose 3d. in
stamps for postage (to any part of the world).

The Story of Marr.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
nVT*OW Marr was come back from the Holv
Land
' With his soul absolved from sin,
And he robbed a fat abbot to pay his
band,
And to keep his left hand in ;
He took a wife from the wives around
And he raided and robbed afar—
And the curse of Rome came over the foam
And after the scalp of Marr.
A Sea King landed in Seabolt Bay
One day when the skies were blue—
The king and his army were far away
And Sir William’s men were few.
Sir William, he gazed on the fearful odds
And the land he held so dear,
And he muttered, sore driven, “I would to
Heaven '
That Marr and his thieves were here ! ”
The Sea King gathered his men to raid,
They out-numbered us three to one ;
There was never a sign of hope or aid.
And we deemed that our day was done.
We saw red visions of blazing roofs,
Dragged women and corpses then,
When ( a stripling shrill from the top of the hill
Cried, “Marr, and a hundred men ! ”
And Marr rode down to the stout old knight—
He had ridden fast and far ;
He’d heard of the sinister sail in sight
Where the northward headlands are.
Sir William gave hand to the outstretched one.
Though it gave his soul a jar :
“ We’ll hang thee after the fight i 3 done.
But I’m glad to see thee, Marr.”
“ You may hang and be damned for a glass of
wine,
But the first thing to do is fight.
[’ll charge their front with these thieves of mine,
Ton charge by the rocks on the right.
Let each man ride with his practised band,
And the hinds make show on the hill.
I’ll rqb as I please in my own good land,
But I’ll swear no sea-thief will.”
He p aused for a space : “ ’Tis an evil case,
And a desperate chance,” said Marr ;
“ Now the gates.of Hell they are open wide.
And the gates of Heaven ajar !
Honest or not, there are souls I wot
Shall fly ere the hour is done.
L *t each man pray who a god hath got,
For I’m cursed if I’ve got one !”
We glanced once more on the doubtful odds,
Theq knelt on the fallen leaves ;
And our men prayed to the Christian gods
And Marr’s to the gods of thieves.
And then we charged. For the next half hour
It was curse and struggle and bleed ;
And thief, or Pagan, or Christian knight
Had little to do with creed.
Some fight for country, or “ honor” or “ right,”
And the boldest fight for pelf;
’Twas a wonderful sight how a thief could fight
For the land that he robbed himself.
We drove them back, and we burned some ships,
And we slew them by the score,
And a man of Marr’s with a world of scars
Took the Sea-King on the shore.
There was revel and light in the hall that night
Ere the weary went to sleep;
And an outlawed man and a Christian knight
And a heathen king drank deep.
Sir William was shamed when the morning came,
He mourned for his bad old age,
And he loudly swore he would drink no more,
And he’d go on a pilgrimage.
Sir William he sent the Sea-King home
To sail and harry again,
And Marr was freed of the curse of Rome
To raid the north with his men.
Sir William is fighting in Palestine
With a hot and a thirsty band—
(The Sea-King promised before he sailed
That he’d go to the Holy Land).

HENRY LAWSON.
The “Square Thing.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
STRESS of weather once forced me to
anchor for a few months in a small
thoroughfare not far from the Yarra, and
within comfortable smelling distance of a big soap
and candle factory. It was misnamed .Unity
Lane, and, apart from the fact that it seemed a
mathematical impossibility for all the children who
played in its gutters to be packed into the few
tenements it contained, it had nothing particularly
noticeable about it. I lodged with two brothers
in a little three-roomed affair that shook and
creaked in every joint whenever the wind blew
faster than 10 miles an hour.
Jack Brimston, the elder brother, drove a lorry
for some big firm in the city. Except that it
never gave him any loose time between daylight
and dark in .which to brood over things, I don’t
think it was a specially fine job, although I never
heard Jack grumble about it. Dave, the other
brother, was unlucky—he used to spend all
his time looking for work. He looked for
it on a vacant bit of ground not far from
Unity Lane, where a motley group of young
fellows used to congregate and help him in his
quest. Dave never by any accident found a job.
And yet, with all the dissimilarity in their
natures, it would be hard to find two men more
attached to each other. During my, sojourn with
them I never heard an angry word pass between
them, and, God knows, Jack had reason enough
to let out sometimes. I often think Jack might
have been a success as a sheep ; but, as a human,
he was a million years either ahead of his time or
behind it. He had one dissipation. He was a
member of a benefit lodge, and regularly once a
fortnight he attended its meetings. The Lord
alone knows what amusement he got out of it, for,
if there’s a duller thing on this earth than the
ordinary meeting of a benefit lodge, I don’t want
to run against it; but, without doubt, he looked
forward to these little outings in much the same
way as a kid does to Christmas.
I was a little surprised, therefore, when he
came into my room one evening when I knew it
was his lodge night, with the inevitable draught-
board under his arm and clad in his working
clothes.
“Hullo, Jack ! No lodge to-night?”
“Well, y’see,” he returned, slowly, “it’s like
this: Dave wanted to go one to-night—the boys
are havin’ a dance or somethin’—so I lent him me
togs. It don’t matter much, anyway ; I feel a
bit off to-night, and Dave don’t get much fun.
He feels it, bein’ out of a job, does Dave.”
I didn’t contradict him—l knew it wouldn’t be
any good ; but, now and then, I couldn’t help
looking at his big, honest head bent so intently
over the draught-board, and wondering how it
would feel to be so innocent.
One morning Dave came to me before I was
out of bed. He was generally in good spirits, but
this morning he seemed more cheerful than usual.
He was humming a little ditty with “ golden
hair” in it if I remember rightly, but he stopped
as he pushed open my door.
“ Nearly got a job a little while ago,” he said
briskly. “Get up, and we’ll go and have a
drink.”
I half rose in bed ; but, on second thought,
dropped back again.
“No use, Dave; I don’t hold it,” and I shook
my head a little sorrowfully, perhaps.
“But I do,” he returned. “ See that.” He
thrust out his hand, and 1 saw a shilling resting
on his palm.
“ Where did you get it?” I asked suspiciously ;
not that I was afraid he had robbed me, but I was
thinking of Jack.
Dave gave a pleasant little laugh.
“Oh, the usual. He heard of a job down
Brighton way that he thought might suit me;
so he gave me this for my fare. I missed the
train.”
I swore gently under my breath, and, after a
pause, said :
“ But there’s a good service on that line. Every
quarter, I think.”
Dave spun the shilling on his hand, and looked
at it intently for a moment before answering.
“ I know ; but 15 minutes is a lot when you’re
after a job. I knew it’d be snapped up before
I could get there, so I came home and saved
Jack’s bob.”
“ And now you want me to help you spend it ?”
“ Well, I’m not going to press you ; but if you
like to come you’re welcome.”
“I’ll see you damned first,” I said ; “ and you’ll
give Jack back that shilling to-night, or I’ll tell
him all about it.”
He came nearer my bed, the merry sparkle
went out of his eyes, and he spoke almost
earnestly.
“You won’t do that. You know, if I contra-
dict you, Jack ’ll believe me, and you won’t break
with him for a bob, will you ? No, no ! He must
think I caught the train all right, and the job was
gone. That’s how it’s going to be, isn’t it ? ”
I didn’t answer him, and he went away laugh-
ing, for he knew it would be as he said. In spite
of his drawbacks, Dave had a remarkably winning
way of his own that was hard to resist. He was
as open as the sun, and, except to Jack, he never
tried to pose as anything better than he was. And
the little deceits he practised on Jack were, I
think, more with the idea of saving that worthy
from unnecessary worry than from any deeper
motives of hypocrisy.
“ I know I’m a loafer,” he said to me one day.
“just as well as I know old Jack’s a grafter. It’s
my nature, and what’s the good of scrapping
against that? Anyway, it’s jolly pleasant floating
with the river. Some day, I suppose, it ’ll
bump me up against a rock, and I’ll have to swim
for it; but I’m not looking for rocks just yet.”
Yet in spite of these philosophical words he
came to me one day in a very sombre humor.
“ I’ve made an unholy mess of things,” he said
in a jerky kind of way very different from his
usual level tones. “ There’s a girl swears she’s
going to have'me up for maintenance.”
“ Guilty ?” I inquired sagely.
“ I suppose so,” he said.
“ What are you going to do—tell Jack, I sup-
pose ? ”
He got up savagely.
“You suppose wrong then ; I’m going to work.”
And he did. He went straight away and got a
job with a furniture-remover, and for a few days
Jack could talk of nothing but Dave and his billet.
“He’s bound to get on,” he told me over and
over. “Dave’s a smart chap, and bound to get a
rise soon. He won’t stop long at thirty bob a
week.”
Jack was right; Dave didn’t stop long. When
he had been there a fortnight he had a row with
his boss, and left in a hurry. In a few days he
had drifted back to his old pals on the vacant
ground. For a month I heard no more about the
maintenance case.
One night Jack came in without the draught-
board. He halted just inside the door, and I
knew by the strange way he was tying his fingers
into knots that something out of the ordinary had
happened.
“ I just had a woman to see me,” he said
awkwardly, when at last he spoke; “she had a
youngster in her arms, and she says Dave ” He
broke off suddenly and looked long and earnestly
out of the window. “ Mind, I don’t blame Dave,”
he continued presently; “he’s young, and we all
make mistakes.”
“ What are you going to do about it ?” I asked.

POISONED
FINGER
Zam-Buk Prevents Festering,
“Gathering,” Inflammation & Disease.
A cut or scratch is the gateway through which
dangerous disease germs enter the body. When a dirty
knife, a rusty needle, a splinter or a thorn scratches
the finger, the latter is inoculated with germs. In a
few hours the finger will become hot and throbbing.
It will be painful to the touch and swell all round the
injury. A little later the wound may exhibit a whitish
appearance in the middle of the swelling, and we have
what is known as a festering or poisoned finger. The
inflammation set up by the poison may spread until the
whole hand and arm are rendered useless.
The only way to avoid such serious results is to
cleanse the wound, however slight, and then apply
Zam-Buk, which is a power ful antiseptic and germ-killer.
Zam-Buk is a purely herbal preparation which, when
applied to the broken skin, soothes and purifies the
wound, and then proceeds to heal with new, healthy
skin in a quick, painless, and perfect manner.
Zam-Buk, which is a unique preparation, must not
be confused with mere ointments, with which it has
nothing in common. It pays to keep a pot of Zam-Buk
always handy.
Mr. F. J. Barnett, of Perry Street, St. Peters, Sydney,
says:—“l am in the employ of the Australian Gas Co., as
gas-main layer, and while at work had the misfortune to injure
my hand. I treated the wound rather carelessly, thinking it
would be all right, but it became worse and showed signs of
blood-poisoning. I applied several ointments, but they did no
good. My hand grew worse and worse, arid I suffered such agony
that I was forced to give up work. It was at this time that Zam-
Buk was recommended. I applied it, and to my delight the wound
immediately began to heal, and after only three weeks’ treatment
with Zam-Buk I was able to return to my work, absolutely cured.”

THE
QUESTION of the DAY.
The question of to-day,
of to-morrow and of
every succeeding day is
HAVE YOU USED PEARS’ SOAP ?
If you Have not, you Have not
done your duty by your skin and
complexion. If, on tHe otHer hand
—that is, on both Hands, and on the
face, and on the skin generally—you
HAVE used PEARS, you can feel
Happy, for you will Have done the
best that possibly can be done tor
the skin’s Health and beauty. There
can be no question about that.
PEARS Has been making beautiful
complexions for nearly 120 years.
PEARS
Matchless for the Complexion*.
He looked at me with his big sheep-like eyes.
“Dave’ll have to do the square thing by her,”
he said firmly.
“Marry her?” I questioned.
He nodded his head. I shifted impatiently.
“ Thfct means you’ll have to sup— I mean you’ll
find it a lot of extra expense.”
Again he nodded gravely.
“I know it will—at least, till Dave gets another
job; but it’s the only way out that I can see.”
Just then, Dave came in. I knew by the angry
glint in his eyes that he had been listening. He
put his hand on Jack’s shoulder, and I saw it
twitch convulsively.
“So she’s been here bothering you, has she,
Jack ! Well, I told her what to expect if she
tried that on, and now she can go to the Devil.
She’ll get no more help from me.”
Dave didn’t mention in what way- he had tried
to stop her from going to the Devil before, or
what help she had ever got from him. I suppose
he thought we knew of his gigantic efforts in that
line, and that any explanation would be super-
fluous.
“Hush, Dave!” said Jack, gently. “You
mustn’t talk like that. She told me you promised
to do the square thing by her if she waited a little
while, and that you hadn’t been near her for a
month. I don’t blame you, Dave, but you ought
to toe the scratch now.”
DaVe made an impatient movement.
“If she hadn’t come prating to you I’d have
done my best for her when things straightened
out a bit. jl told her that. Now she can do what
she damn well pleases, and I’ll stand the racket.
This isn’t your row, Jack, so you’ll please stand
out.”
And all Jack’s pleading Wouldn’t budge hitn
one inch.
"I told her not to tell you,” he reiterated,
“ and now she can do her damndest.”
For a week Jack moped about the house of an
evening, apparently taking no notice of anybody
or anything with the exception of Dave —he was
always the same to his brother. He didn’t even
come near me with the draught-board. Once as I
was passing through the little back room I heard
him mutter s “ No, it ain’t the square thing—it’s a
dashed long way from it.” Then quite suddenly
he took to going out at night. Putting One thing
with another. I began to think that Dave’s lapse
had got on to Jack’s nerves, and that he was
taking to drink ; but I soon discovered that I Was
mistaken.
He cariie to me one night when I was scribbling,
and sat on the edge of the bed,
“Interruptin’ you?” he asked, faintly.
“Not at all.”
For a minute or two he fidgeted about rather
nervously, and kept rubbing one hand Up and
down the side of his face. At last he made a little
scraping noise in his throat.
“I’ve been thinkin* that it ain’t good for amatl
to live alone,” he said with a slight effort.
“You’re never likely to do that,” I returned,
thinking of Dave.
“Aw, I didn’t mean Dave. Course he Wouldn’t
desert me. What I meant was —well, y’see, I’m
goin’ to be married.”
So that was the reason for his going out o’
nights 1 I was so pleased that my dark sus-
picions Were unfounded that I got op and gave
iiim a thump on the back.
“Good!” I cried joyously. “The Very best
thing that could happen. Who’s the lucky one?”
“Well,” he returned, slowly, “y’see, as Dave
wouldn’t do the square thing by that girl, I
thought ’twas up to me to do it.”
I said nothing. No words that I could think
of would fit the case.
C. O. HUTBUSH.
Mrs. Brown in Politics.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE elections spelt immense excite-
ment in the house of Brown. Mrs.
Brown had been enrolled, and; had leapt
ardently into the seething pool of. politics.
What was “worth doin’ was worth takin’
an interest in—leastways, them ..was her
opinions.” So, hitching her perambulator to
what might be termed an entire constellation, she
steered a devious course towards the end of all
things—the polling-booth.
There was no place in the scheme of things for
Brown in those days ; no niche in the universe
where his soul might crumble peacefully away.
He would often wonder “ wot’d become of men
when all wimmen got ideas on things.”
Whsifmadeit worse for Brown was thechameleon*
I ike quality of Mrs. Brown’s views. He was never
certain enough of them to propitiate her by amiable
agreement. Sometimes they seemed to depend
on the weather. Two north-wind days, and she
talked White Australia volubly. Then, when
Nellie took mumps and measles pretty well
together, she saw in that strong reasons for sup-
porting the Fusionists. At last, on washing-day,
it seemed as if Providence had put the longed-for
clue into Brown’s hand. It was this way. Mrs.
Smith, next door, was telling Mrs. Brown over
the fence about a Labor meeting she’d been to,
when a sheet, supposed to be securely fixed on the
line, fluttered to the earth and had to be put
back into the tub. “Now,” said Mrs. Brown, re-
lating the incident, “ a woman as ’as time to keep
another ’ard-workin’ woman jawin' ■ over the
fence ain’t likely to git ’old of the right
perlitical opinions. An’, anyhow, if I was to vote
for the man she was talkin’ about, there’d be no
livin’ next door to ’er, even if the fence was
mended, which it ain’t likely to be. No, I’m off
the Labor ticket. Not that I’m wishin’ ’em any
’arm, for I says, ‘Live an’ let live.’ But no
respectable woman wants to go gaddin’ to
meetin’s. Some gentleman’s always bound to
drop in an’ make things clear. I remember one
as came last elections, ’ow ’e was so took with
Georgie, an’ nursed ’im all the time ’e was tellin’
me who to vote for. I told ’im Mr. Brown ’d be
sure to vote for his man ; but as for me, I always
went to the cemetery on Wednesdays, an’ I’m not
one as believes in mixin’ prayers with pork, when
I can help it. Leastways, them’s my opinions.”
But alas ! Saturday found her with strong
Socialistic leanings, having failed to stretch the
week’s wages over a few necessities of life.
“Them folks as ’as more than’s good for ’em,
I’m out of patience with ’em. Why, I seen a ’at
marked up in a shop the price that’d pay the
rent for a year. I call it downright wicked. The
Lord never meant a bird to cost that much even
if it is stuffed. Look at me ! I pays eleven
pence for me last ’at, and has to chase half an hour
round the yard after a fowl to git a few feathers
to put on it to take the plainness off ; an’ the
extra runnin’ about put it off layin’, which meant
no puddins for a week. Some folks don’t know
wot it is to trim yer ’at with yer vittles, so to
speak. No ! I’m off Freetrade from this on.
Right’s right—leastways, them’s my opinions.”
Polling-day came at last. Mrs. Brown had slept
in her clothes ; “ fer,” said she, “ how do I know
the place won’t be burnt down in the night, and
me left without a stitch to go out in ? No ; when
I makes up me mind, I kin put up with a extry
bit of discomfort.”
* * * *
Tea-time came. She had not returned. Eight,
nine. 10 o’clock. The gate clicked and a jaded
female entered.
“Well, Mary, wot’s kept you so late? An’
who’d yer vote fer ? ”
“Vote!” snorted Mary. “Who said I voted
fer anyone ? Just as I gits up to the
booth, I see that Jane Shaw sailin’ in.
So I says to a gentleman standing near,
‘Please,’ I says, is there anywhere else a
respectable married woman as wishes no ’arm to
no one can vote?’ ‘Why not inside there,
Ma’am?’ says ’e, pointin’ at the door. ‘ln
thefe ! * says I. ‘ Didn’t yer see that —I don’t,
Want to speak no harm of her—wot went in with
a blue dress an' *er ’at on one side 1 If yer knew
wot she said to me at the sale last year yer
wouldn’t expect it. No} if she votes there I
don’t. There’s a place fer everything, an’ every-
thing in its place is my motter J an’, I says, if her
place is in there, it’s no place fer me ! If yer see
Deakin yer might tell him I was goin’ to
vote Akcus—’e’ll understand ; I ’is
missus reads ’im bits out of the papers.’ So I
gits in a tram and goes to see Emma —an’a mortal
blessin’ it was I did. Three of ’em down with
measles, an’ Emma tryin’ to make jam in bet weep
dosin' ’em. So I made ’er'sit down an’ rest a bit,
an’ then Mrs. Gave come in and tried to talk
polertics ; but I let ’er know wot I thought—even
if *er sister was ’ousemaid next door to Tren-
withs’. I takes her up pretty short, and says’ow
I’ve no patience With wimmin wot’s took up with
things out ol their sp’ere; an’ yer can call to-
morrow an’ git my nartie took off the rolls, I says.
I have me opinions, an’, while I’m spared. I’ll
keep ’em, thanks be.”
BAMBOO.
By the Great Grey Gum.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HERE, Where the great grey gum uplifts,
Here, Where the full-fed river drifts ■
Deep and cold from the lonely hills,
Sliding down to the lone grey coasts ;
Here, where the chalice of darkness spills,
And into the shadow they come, the ghosts,
When the moon is dark and the thicket heaves
With rustle and laughter, like mournful leaves,—
This is ttiy bed ; and what do. I fear
Who haVe slept and Wakened there many a year ?
Vet, every dawn when the river sings
In the fading dark, and the red day swings
Into the heavens’ sweep gloriously,
I think of the world the hills beyond,
And set my feet where the barriers be.
But he calls me back, like a lone heart fond.
With a tug in>the breast and a woeful spell.
He calls to me ever, an*d calls me well ;
For I turn alway on the same old track
Where the great gum lifts, and the tide is black.
A cold dead thing in a deep down grave,
He is the master and I the slave.
And though I slew him in one wild, wild night,
When the grey gum creaked as a strange wind
woke ;
And the moon leaned out of a cloudy height
•At his deathless cry when his heartstrings
broke;
Though I plunged him deep (ah, his red* red
gold !)
Where the slow swirl rippled in, fold on fold—
He is my lord, and of this my soul
Till my last stark day will he take his toll !
When the midnight moon from her cloudy tower
Peers warily down, and the hapless hour
Brings down the sleep to my wearied eyes ;
When strange shapes rustle like imps of dreams.
And a lost wind whimpers across the skies.
In my deepest slumber I feel the gleams
Of grateful stars that wait to see
The horror come up to tryst with me :
The haunting vision that night on night
Awakes to stifle my soul with fright.
Blinded, I mark the waters stir,
Circling slowly and sinister.
Sleeping, my thousand pulses drum
Thunderous, when from the water dire.
Rises his head and his faint eyes come,
And his pallid shape, and high and higher
He lifts from the melting flood. The moon,
Wicked and wan, looks out; the croon
Of the flitting shadows steal fitfully
When the grey Thing hovers and bends to me.
It is my doom that I may not wake,
Though blood is as water and tense veins brea-k,
Till, like a red hot thirst, I feel
A soft pressed palm on my beating head,
A fearful hand with a touch like steel.
So the spell fails, and sick with dread
I turn and wake ... to hear him wail
That terrible cry, and to see the bale
Of the strange faint eyes, while the phantom
• stands
With the blade in deep, and with outflung hands !
Here where the great grey gum uplifts,
Here where the black tide seaward drifts
Past the thickets that tell no tale,
Under the moon that knows so well,
A sleeper turns with a broken wail,
And wakes with eyes that have looked on Hell.
Can you mark, swung out from the haunted place,
Blown rifle smoke on the waters’ face ?
Can you heat—can you hear in the fateful hour
What the whis terers say in the rustling bower l
