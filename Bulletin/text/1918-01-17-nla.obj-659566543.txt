The Red Page
Gloom ricrion
Four novels* deliberately run counter to
the booksellers’ counsel that war-time fiction
must be.composed to distract the reader from
his grim preoccupations. These authors
, callously give us gloom. Edith Wharton
mixes it with a pre-doomed romance; James
Joyce a’supra-human objeetive-
ness of the futile struggles of weak human-
ity ; Ex-Mill-Girl, from the first page, .wal-
lows in undiluted gloom.
“Night with a laugh of anarchy blotted
out the symbols of law and order, gave in-
finity for acres, reclaimed for a short time
the wild that was half tame, and lent a
sense that here fierce deeds had been done,
and might be done again. For why should
not fierce, dark deeds happen here again?”
They do. “It was Witches’ Country, at
the hour wlign their spells were worked:
when Will-o’-the-Wisp carried his wavering
lamp over black moors, blacker pool, and
shaking bog; when Barguest, the moorland
spirit-dog, followed the lonely traveller
caught in the net of darkness, the weird
paws sounding splosh-splosh behind him on
the soppy ground. It was the hour when
children spawned by the bog were found—
to be claimed at length by the bog, after
they had tasted human joy, human sorrow.”
Thus, a little unfairly, Ex-Mill-Ghi sets her
gruesome scene; for the story that follows
depends not upon these diabolical phantasies
but upon the conflict of gross and noble
human wills. The tragedy is one of human
ignorance, not of human superstition.
It is a tragedy of intense interest, with
a powerful and poignant appeal. Helen is
a noble character, drawn with the grim
incisiveness of a Thomas Hardy heroine.
She is held in thrall by her supposed father
—a horrible figure of malignancy, the mad-
ness in his blood acting as the spur for a
vile, purposeful hate. For Helen is not his
daughter; she is the child of a woman who
refused his love; and he lives but to make
the daughter suffer for the mother’s scorn
of him. lie finds a useful tool in a farm-
hand who loves Helen as she loves him, but
who is afraid of" that supposed hereditary
strain of insanity in her. Chance brings a
brutal tramp to the desolate farm ; and the
old man conceives bis final revenge. He sells
Helen to the tramp; and when her lover
runs away from Helen’s desperate wooing,
she accepts the tramp for reasons which
actually convince the reader. This is a
triumph of writing; for the nobility of
Helen's character is balanced by her igno-
rance of the world. The tragedy runs through
a series of dramatic scenes, brilliantly
imagined and described, with a mastery of
language, a sense of drama and a deep know-'
ledge of psychology. But the author, subtly
conscious of the inartistrv of piling horror
on horror, relents at the last moment; and
the dreadful night has a dawn of hope and
happiness.
Helen makes; the masterful woman’s mis-
take. She does the wooing herself. .No
wonder Martin, the ineffective farin-hand
who adores her, runs away. The old man
looks spitefully on.
“Besides, if I’m not mista’en, Helen’s
never played her hussy-card, yet. I ca’ it
her hussy-card. It’s not flirting. She could
flirt no more nor a wild-cat could flirt. She’s
savage. But fro’ Eve up’ards every woman
has had a hussy-card in their pack. Some’s
hardly known it were thear, an’ never used
it. Some lias. Some has bin too proud—
an’ Helen’s proud. It’s showin’ a bit too
much stockin’ i’ some, an' showin’ too little
in others. It’s wearin’ a ribbon to flap i’
somebody’s eyes just when it shouldn't. It’s
owt —an’ it’s nowt, in n way. It’s stickin’
to him with both arms when he’s chivalrous,
so as he can’t get away. Lots play it wi’out
knowin’ it. But Helen”- —-
Helen, in desperation, does play it—to the
limit. “Tim’s tli’ curse on thee,” he says.
“Can ta pass it on, and on. and on, forever?
Can ta not be brave enough to say, ‘lt
shall end here’?”
“Curst, am I?” she cries. “Why? Be-
cause I might lm’ a child that were gladder
or sadder than most, at th’ coinin’ up o’ th’
moon? Or because it might fancy itself a
prince, when its pockets were empty? Or
because it might, in some minute, plunge a
knife into what it loved? Sane men do that
last, every day i’ th’ calendar. . . .What if I
bore an idiot? Somewhere between man and
dog his mind would come. Would he be
less happy? Would he be less loved?”
Her last woman’s resource fails: he goes
away: and in her shame she marries the
tramp. Her life is nothing but a long tor-
ment of cruelty, with the hate-maddened old
man for ever turning the knife in her heart.
And when Martin comes back these two
take their lives into their own hands; and
survive, Strangely, to a life of happiness.
It is a story full of sombre beauty, and
the personality of Helen Stands out from
the ruck of fiction characterisations. As a
first novel, this book, in the style, the story
and the persons of the drama, is a remarkable
and matured achievement in the domain of
Gloom.
S
James Joyce may be regarded as The
Limit in Irish Literature. He is the most
objective of all modern writers; his stuff
sounds exactly like a Leacock pnro'dy of the
Russian Novel. Listen to this : “ 'Goloshes!’
said Mrs. Conroy. ‘That’s the latest. When-
ever it’s wet underfoot I must put on my
goloshes. To-night even, he wanted me to
put them on, but I wouldn’t. The next thing
he’ll buy me will be a diving suit.’ Gabriel
laughed nervously, and patted his tie reassur-
ingly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled her-
self. so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The
smile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face, and
her mirthless eyes were directed towards her
nephew’s face. After a pause she asked —
“‘And what are goloshes, Gabriel?’
“ ‘Goloshes, Julia!’ exclaimed her sister.
‘Goodness me, don’t you know what goloshes
are? You wear them over your....over
your boots, Gretta, isn’t it?’
“ ‘-Yes,’ said Mrs. Conroy. ‘Guttapercha
things. We both have a pair now’. Gabriel
says everyone wears them on the continent.’
“ ‘Oh, on the continent,’ murmured Aunt
Julia, nodding her head slowly.
“Gabriel knitted his brows and said*as if
he were ; slightly angered :
“ ‘lt’s nothing very wonderful, but Gretta
thinks it _ very funny because she says the
word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.’ ’’ *
There are pages and pages like that in
Dubliners. Joyce must make Tchekov
jealous.
Yet there is a strange power in this collec-
tion of sketches. Joyce makes you see Dub-
lin, almost makes you live there —so objec-
tively true and "so callously real are his
studies. He flashes a relentlesslv steady,
cold, brilliant light upon the Dubliners, show-
ing tip every half-thought in their brains,
and depicting, ay a visitant from another
planet alight depict, the curious antics of
our human kind. There is no pity here, no
sympathy, just an intent scientific analysis,
an unfeeling probe of cold steel. Dreary,
yes; but horribly, inhumanly true.- Feckless
and sordid lives, most of them : certainly the
worst advertisement the Irishman hasVver
had.
The death of a priest: “There he lay,
solemn and copious, vested as for the altar,
his large hands loosely retaining a chalice.
His face was very truculent, grey and mass-
ive, with black, cavernous nostrils and
circled by a scanty white fur.” The encoun-
ter of two schoolboys with an uncanny old
man. written as a schoolboy would recall the
incident, with nothing explained. A drunken
spree of some rich young men. The inarticu-
late love of a boy for a girl. Two horrible
young men who “pick up” servant-girls in
order to borrow money from them. The
dreary chronicles of a dreary boarding-house,
in which the boarder gets the landlady’s
daughter in trouble, and the mother makes
him promise to marry the girl. A dissolute
clerk, dismissed for incompetence, who goes
on a drunken spree, but can’t raise sufficient
money to get really drunk, and on his return
home takes his revenge on the world by beat-
ing his little son. So the painful catalogue
goes on, a dreary record of futile and insig-
nificant lives, which James Joyce would have
us believe represent the lives of Dubliners.
Yet it is lit by rare touches of pathos and
innocence and beauty; and never once-does
the author drop his inhuman aloofness from
his poor puppets. If absolute objectivity be
an art it is a horrible art. But James Joyce
can write. His book ends appropriately
with this passage :
“Yes, the newspapers were right: snow
was general all over Ireland. It was falling
on every part of the dark central plain, on
the treeless lulls, falling softly upon the
Bog of Allen, and, farther westward, softly
falling into the. dark, mutinous Shannon,
waves. It was falling, too, upon every part
of the lonely churchyard on the hill where
Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly
drifted on the, crooked crosses and head-
stones, on the spears of the little gate, on the
barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as
he heard the snow falling faintly through
the universe and faintly falling,' like the
descent of their last end, upon all the living
and the dead.”
A Portrait of the Artist as a. Young Man
took James Joyce 10 years to write. It has
all the appearance of an autobiographical
novel —though with Joyce one could never
really toll. It is the painfully frank story of
an Irishman from his childhood to his man-
hood. Joyce gets very near achieving the
impossible task that so often confronts an
author—to write one’s own life with a per-
fect candor, to tear ruthlessly aside, in the
interests of his art, those reticences and that
sense of decency without which social inter-
course, life itself, would not be possible. And
Joyce has almost dgne this most difficult
thing.
lie begins at the beginning: “Once upon a
time, and a very good time it was, there was
a moocow coming down along the road, and
this moocow that was down along the rbad
met a nicens little boy named baby
Kuckoo....
“His father told him that story: his father
looked at him through a glass: he had a
hairy face.
“He was baby Kuckoo. The moocow came
down the road where Betty Bryne lived: she
sold lemon platt.
“Oh, the wild rose blossoms
On the little green place.
“He sang that song. That was the song.
“Oh, the green wotlie botheth.
"When you wet the bed. first it is warm,
then it gets cold. liis mother put on the
oil-sheet. That had the queer smell.
“His mother had a nicer smell than his
father. She played on the piano the sailor’s
hornpipe for him to dance. He danced ”
Thus Joyce recalls his earliest memories.
And with the same pitiless realism he shows
the schoolboy.
“He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows
on the table and shut and opened the flaps
of his ears. Then lie heard the noise of the
refectory every time he opened the flaps of
his ears. It made a roar like a train at
night. And when he closed the flaps the roar
was shut off like a train going into a
tunnel. . ..
“AVas it right to kiss his mother or wrong
to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to
kiss? You put your face up like that to
say good-night, and then his mother put her
face down. That was to kiss. His mother
put her lips on his cheek; her lips Were soft
and they wetted his cheek; find they made a
tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do
that with their two faces?”
All the strange fancies of the child mind
are here, groping in a threatening, confusing
world for the meaning of things, and unable
to express itself except inarticulately. He
has his futile, innocent love-affair with a
little girl. After an entertainment she came
witli him to his tram : “He heard what her
eyes said to him from beneath their cowl,
and knew that in some dim past, whetheT in
life or revery, he had heard their tale before.
He saw her urge her vanities, her fine dress
and sash and long black stockings, and knew
that he had yielded to them a thousand
times. Yet a voice within him spoke above
the noise of his dancing heart, asking him
would he take her gift to which he had only
to stretch out his hand.... He stood list-
lessly in Ins place, seemingly, a tranquil
watcher of the scene before him.
“ ‘.She. too, wants me to catdi hold of her,’
lie thought. ‘That’s why she came witli me
to the tram. I could easily catch hold of
her: nobody is looking. I could hold her and
kiss her.’
“But he did neither: and, when he was
sitting alone on the deserted tram he tore
bis ticket into shreds and stared gloomily at
the corrugated footboard.”
Joyce goes deeper into the darker side of
childhood. This imaginative, precocious child
is tortured by his unworthiness and the ever-
present fear of Hell. And the priest gives
the class of schoolboys a picture of Hell that
is as grimly realistic as Joyce’s picture of
the mind of his hero. There are seven pages
of the preacher’s address- —a detailed and'
lurid tourist’s guide to Hades. The boy, in
terror, makes his confession, and mortifies
the flesh with an, amazing ingenuity. But
he relapses.
He tries to write poetry; he becomes a
student at the university ; he argues at in-
tolerable length with his fellows over religion
and love and life —-and the dullness of these
conversations is to the author just as impor-
tant as anything else that happens to his
hero. In the end we learn vaguely that
the youth will leave Ireland, though with
a mind still confused and inarticulate, and
with motives unexplained. His futile love-
affair peters out. The tremendous compel-
ling unrest of youth forces his unwilling feet
to wander.
“The spell of arms and voices; the white
arms of roads, their promise of close em-
braces and the black arms of tall ships that
stand against the moon, their tale of distant
nations. They are held out to say: ‘AYe are
alone—come.’ And the voices say with
them : ‘AVe are your kinsmen.’ And the air
is thick with their company as they call to
me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shak-
ing the wings of their exultant and terrible
youth.
“Mother is putting my new second-hand
clothes in order. She prays now, she says,
that I may learn in my own life and away
from home and friends what the heart is and
what it feels. Amen. So be it. AVel-
come, O life! Igo to encounter for the
millionth time the reality of experience and
to forge in the smithy of my soul the un-
created conscience of my race.”
If this is the Irish soul, Joyce has terribly
dissected it. If this book is a masterpiece,
it is a masterpiece of sordid realism, written
by a great literary artist, in a medium that
is painful and depressing. It is life depicted
with a pitiless clarity by an inhuman and
perfectly dispassionate pen.
Summer is a story of lighter, though still
sombre, texture. Edith AVliarton’s work is
always highly polished; anfl she can turn
you out a neat and graceful comedy or an
introspective New England tragedy without
a single split-infinitive or one adjective too
many. Though Summer has not the tre-
mendous impact of her Ethan Frome: it is
in the same key. Here she presents a soli-
tary girl in a lost New England village, over
which the mountain looms with a suggestion
of doom. For Charity had come from the
mountain, the home of a small community of
refugees and ' outcasts, whither even the
sheriff dare not penetrate. Charity, rescued
as a baby from a disreputable mother, is
brought up in the home of a derelict lawyer,
stranded in the desolate village. Enters the
stranger from- the great world outside. Fol-
lows the love affair, that promises so fairly
at first—if for si moment you forget the
shadow of the looming mountain.
“She had given him all she had —but what
was it compared to the other gifts life held
for him? She understood now the case of
girls like herself to whom this kind of thing
had happened. They gave all they had, but
their all was not enough : it could not buy
more than a few moments.”
The man goes away. The shadow* of the
mountain deepens; but at the last moment
Edith Wharton lightens it with a touch of
grey. Exquisite work this, in a locale Edith
Wharton has made her own. But somehow*
the reader misses the tragedy in his admira-
tion for the too-beautiful workmanship. -
Adela Punkhurst litis written a plaj r ,
Betrayed (Fraser and Jcnkinson, Melln, Is.
6d.). In live acts it relates the history of
an imaginary rebellion in Orry, obviously
Ireland, against the British Government.
Desultory lighting goes on until at last the
Orry capitalists, forming the Provisional
Government of Orry, arrange with the Brit-
ish for the concession of Ilome Buie —with
stipulations. The workers are to pay the
price; they are to be enslaved by their
Home Buie capitalist government. ' They
rebel and are beaten ; their leaders are exe-
cuted, and in the epilogue the workers are
seen cowed and enslaved, forced to compete
with cheap indentured Chinamen for their
living. The theme is absurd enough, out the
drama is non-existent. As a tract it may
no doubt aptly express the views of Adela
Pankhurst about England and Ireland ; but
it consists chiefly of elaborate speeches and
elaborate stage-directions. In one act there
is waged on the stage a rebellion in which
the workers’ army is defeated by the British
soldiers, and the Town Hall is shelled and
catches fire. In the next act the workers’
leaders are condemned to death, and each
makes long speeches from the dock. The
whole thing is a dull and vague account of
something that the autffor fails ever to make
real.

If Australian kiddies likq fairy stories
with a moral as obvious as a tank, then
Sulks (Irizzlegrumps , by Aldea Wane, will
please them; but this story, daintily illus-
trated by Dorothy Fry, hardly seems original
or pleasing enough, or its diction simple
enough, to merit the announcement that it
has been copyrighted in Canada and the
U.S.A.. and that dramatic, cinema and other
rights have been reserved.

An interesting publication is Generals of
the British Army, the first part of which has
been issued by Coustkv Life. London ; ss.
A dozen generals are here adequately pic-
tured in colored drawings from life by
Francis Dodd, and brief biographies are
attached. The most striking portrait is that
of General Byng. Generals Allenby, Bird-
wood and Smuts are also included.
Talking about Billjim’s reading matter,
the last publication one would expect to find a wel-
come in the trenches is a Government Gazette, But
this particular Gazette was the Barmaids’ Register,
issued last June, and containing the full names
of 2200 bar-ladies registered under new Vic.
licensing legislation. I sent a copy to a “hard-doer”
Billjim pal in France, and his letter of acknowledg-
ment has meandered home. “That Gazette was a
dinkum whiff of Home. Sweet Home,” he writes.
There has been a big demand for it amongst the
Vies. Even some of the T.T’s have a few favorites
to look up. The officers’ mess has a loan of it at
present.” The Register is a valuable guide to
parents with an unnamed girl babe, as it contains a
wide assortment of Christian names—fancy and
plain, descending from haughty Hyentha to humble
Hannah.
Frank Ilentv: The Australian writer for kids has
to contend with an influence which is not usually
considered when the writer is at work. As a rule,
the Australian youngster is a serious-minded reader.
Billy Bluegum, described as swinging on the eucalyp-
tus-bough in a sedate and decorous manner, creates
just as much interest as Billy wearing a broad but
unnatural grin. Aunt Jane, however, looking over
some books for Little Annie, seizes on Billy-with-the-
grin as “very nice,” and buys the book for its humor
—just the thing for a child, in her opinion. So
when the writer of a neat and simple story for
Annie and Willie takes her MS.‘to the publisher, the
dingbat in the swivcl-chai •, who usually has a
liumor-bump the size of a peanut, suggests that the
author should alter her work to include the broad
grin—not for the enjoyment of VVillie and Annie, but
to sell the book to Aunt Jane. 'This probably
acounts for the blithersomeness of so much Aus-
tralian kid-literature.

A valuable feature of the first part of
Vol. VII of J. H. Maiden’s The Forest-
Flora of N.S.'W, is an article upon our in-
digenous seeds and fruits. He would like to
see the purveyors of false seed “subjected to
the penalties of a Draconian law’’: and he
insists upon the importance of planting only
useful species in re-afforestation operations,
having seen plantations in Australia that,
owing to the wrong species having been
chosen, are now of no Value. .1. 11. Maiden
supplies useful hints for the germination of
seeds that, like those of the wattle, require
special treatment.

You Wouldn’t Poison
Your Own Children
Yet many people allow their children to poison
themselves.
Half of the diseases of childhood may be traced
to a single cause—constipation and resulting self-
poisoning.
Continuous self-poisoning in early years, not only
causes specific diseases, but undermines the health
to a degree that can never be repaired.
You can keep your children healthy and vigorous
by the use of Nujol. Nujol is easy to take and
relieves the most obstinate cases of constipation.
Nujol keeps the bowels clean and free from
disease-causing decayed foods and germs. It
acts as an internal lubricant, is not absorbed by
the body, does not form a “habit” and is harmless
in any quantity.

Summer.
Summer has a happy song
Blowing out of yellow places
Where the dimpled sunlight traces,
In the changing shadows strong,
Arabesques the whole day long
On the round hills’ happy faces,
And the patterns of old laces
Fall the merry vales along.
Sweet to lie on wind-blown grass
Making our own melody
In that summer land apart,
Wind and sun of dreams that pass
Changing still for you and me
The warm dimples of the heart!
n.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Involution.
In you, as in a crystal clear
That shows revolving time and space,
I see each age of man appear
At once, before my face.
I hurt you with a little word ;
Red flames your cheek, your dear eyes
blaze —•
The savage from his stone-age stirred
At tiger-madness plays.
But quick to sweet remorse you spring,
Your warm, brown hands encompass me;
And to your iron strength I cling—
Courageous, firm and free.
Hope wakens at your earnest hold,
Rearing her citadel of brass,
Where gleaming banners beat and fo;d
Across a sea of glass.
And then you kiss me, and your love
Sings of the golden age of song,
Of stars and those large realms above
r r , A which we move along.

ZORA CROSS.
The Traitor.
If I could wear a bandage o’er my eyes
As they say Love does, then my heart unwise
Would turn your honey-phrases into truth,.
And they would spring so lusty with their
youth
To storm the wall, and thus the breach
begin ;
My lips the traitor that would let you in!
Which were the best? To lonely be and wise,
Or, fumbling at the latch with bandaged
eyes,
To let the guardian Wisdom vanquished go,
And yield your castle to your dearest foe?

Two Stars.
A low wind sighing passes,
And sighs and dies anew :
And all the flowers and grasses
Are wet with tears of dew.
The sea and land seem dreaming
Beneath that baleful star —
Hung high and fiercely gleaming—
Of wounds and death and war.
Yet sweet with calm that leavens
The hour and its repining,
Within the western heavens
The Star of Love is shining.

Washing Up.
A dingy, squalid suburb and a squalid, dingy
lane,
And a house to make your heart ache at
its twelve-and-six a week;
But the snow’s on Kosciusko, and I’ve snow-
shoes on again,
And above the splash of washing-up I hear
the mountains speak.
A savage old nor’-wester, frosty “sago” in
his hair.
Is roaring on the summit (he’s a dear old
pal o’ mine),
And the crockery goes crashing, but just
somehow I don’t care,
Though I bought the lot at auction with
a borrowed one-and-nine.
The urchins of the neighbors play their
marbles on the kerb
(They’re pals o’ mine in other moods for
all their frowsy dirt),
But the Gentian Patch on Twynam comes
upon me to disturb
With a knife of recollection that is good,
for all its hurt.
p-be Gentian Patch on Twynam, with the
Blue Lake in its lap.
And Muller’s Peak to nor’ard right across
the old moraine,
The Perisher and Paralyser misted through
the Gap
Where the Snowy River wriggles—but it
gives a chap a pain !
Just a silly sort of wistful sort of what-the-
hell’s-the-odds !
There’s work and washing-up to do, and
chops to buy and fry;
But the man who has a household and who
hasn’t household gods
Makes his life a sadder muddle just the
more he tries to try.
The next-door wop is cursing—she was once
a comely girl!
The kids are at their marbles —they’ll be
butcher-boys in time!
Well, the washing-up is over and my head’s
in such a whirl
And my heart’s beyond describing—so I’ll
finish off this rhyme.
MAORILAND.

A BALLAD OF REVOLUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE King sat in Dumbfearful town,
Drinking the blood-red wine;
His brow was twisted to a frown,
His whiskers drooped like twine.
Without, the Revolution roared;
And orators in rows
Their, eager congregations bored
With loud, fantastic prose.
So well they talked, so long they spoke,
Their throats grew rough and sore;
And perspiration madly broke
From every glistening pore.
The veins upon their foreheads swelled;
Their hard-stretched collars burst;
No power could stay the words they
yelled
Till language died in thirst.
The Red Guards howled their fierce
applause
Each time a speaker failed;
Terrific curses filled each pause
And long the women wailed;
The warships fired a loud salute,
The sun went redly down;
And everybody cried for loot
In grey Dumbfearful town.
Oh, blood is redder far than wine,
And flame is far more hot!
(The Royal whiskers sagged like twine
Above the boozing pot.)
And loud without the clamor w 7 ent,
And shriller grew the din;
The discord of the firmament
Ra..g like cow-trodden tin.
And fiercely rolled the flood of speech
Like fifty streams in flood,
With i«fty lessons they must teach
To one low r bank of mud.
The red flags waved, the trumpets blew;
Word-scourged the people rose
Tremendous things to dare and do
Against their age-long foes.
They pulled the palace railings down,
They smashed the palace door,
They broke the throne and kicked the
crown
About the wash-house floor;
But greater, darker deeds than these
The Revolution knew.
(Oh, flags upon the battle-breeze!
The Guards were lame and few!)
Uprising, roaring like the tide,
They hurst each bond and bar.
The royal cat to music died
Wearing a cross and star.
Stern men they were, and unafraid
Of aught that life might bring—
They got a safety-razor blade
And smoothly shaved the King!

THE LAND OF MICAWBER
AUSTRALIS.
One of these days an unkind but not
wholly unreliable historian will write up
Australia as a land of silly children, who
played at prosperity and made a lamentable
mess of the grandest opportunity in all
history. The mess has been with us for
many years, and it grows worse. Australia,
in the glorious times of peace, when it had
no navy and hardly even a semblance of an
army to support, seldom made the two
ends of its public finance meet. It blewed
the best and most accessible of its mineral
riches and hardly ever made the two ends
meet. It realised in a wholesale fashion on
the public lands which cost it nothing, and
had the same old difficulty about making
ends meet. In fact, it didn’t want to make
them meet. It got into a strange baby-like
habit of regarding solvency as a sin. So
it kept taxes down to a minimum and floated
big loans with which to build public works,
and the revenue derived from them, taken
as a whole, being less than the expenditure
on working and maintenance, ends didn’t
meet there either. One of New South
Wales’s big tin gods, George Reid of imme-
morial stomach measurement, did these
three things at practically one and the
same time: (1) Manufactured a small sur-
plus by charging about £700,000 of this
year’s loan interest to next year; (2)
reduced the already inadequate Customs
tariff to the loss of revenue, the discourage-
ment of local industry and the great
encouragement of imports of German and
other foreign goods; (3) charged even the
new cups and saucers for the Jenolan accom-
modation-house to loans. In his own State
the foolish children who were playing at
prosperity regarded Reid as a sort of deity.
And he got vast newspaper support, as dul
other blatant and roaring time-servers like
him. For many years The Bulletin was
the only paper of any note in Australia
which preached the anti-borrowing doctrine,
and it did so amid the pitying smiles of the
foolish children, who said that this was a
neiv country” and “everything would come
right ” Even the immortal Micawber,
whom all readers of Dickens recognise as
a humorous and enchanting ass, had sense
enough to know that a constant deficit in
the accounts leads to disaster. Australia
in the aggregate knows less than Micawbeb,
and has been in that condition for 50 years
and more. The artist is hereby urged to
draw a new Australia —one with short, tight
pants, low shoes, a shabby, brief frock-coat
and a jaunty but superannuated plug hat
on one side of a hairless head. That Aus-
tralia, charging madly at the German
trenches in Flanders, would be a strange
but truthful mixture of boundless valor and
unlimited lOU.
In New South Wales the first Labor Gov-
ernment clambered into office on a promise
that it would reduce the State’s loan expen-
diture, then standing at £1,500,000 a year.
Instead it ran the thing up to £5,000,000,
then £7,000,000, then £9,000,000 a year. It
is waste of energy, however, to call any
politician a liar, a scoundrel, an impostor,
a deceiver, a Judas who sold the com-
munity in order to buy votes, a shameless
fraud, an uncertificated political insolvent,
a political card-sharper and confidence man.
a corrupt agent for the importers of
foreign goods, a stipendiary enemy of his
people, a shortsighted Juggins or any
words to that effect. All the States acquired
a fresh and invigorated borrowing mania at
about the same time, and so long as that
quaint and amusing creature Micawbeb
Australis approved, nothing could be done.
But the original Micawbeb had David
Copperfiei.d’s aunt to fall back upon, and
the aunt paid his debts. We havq only our
uncle to fall back upon, and he wants us to
pay him. Which is a difference.
» * * *
All these things happened, be it remem-
bered, in a time of profound peace, for the
war expenses are a Federal and not a State
affair. And they are still happening in a
time of profound State peace. The tran-
quillity was so profound that of the six
States five showed an increased revenue
for the last half-year (Victoria had an
increase of £543,911 and South Australia
of £335,080 for the half-year, and only New
South Wales announced a small decrease).
Yet the three States which publish expen-
diture accounts all had appalling deficits—
New South Wales one of about £1,000,000,
which is somewhat striking for a six-
months’ effort; Queensland over £370,000;
Westralia over £457.000. For some reason
unknown Wilkins Australis selected this
time of all others for a special razzle of
expenditure, though what exactly he bought
with the. money doesn’t appear. And he
also borrowed all the money he could get
for public works. It is hinted that the
States won’t be able to keep faith with the
Commonwealth in the matter of repaying
the first instalment of certain advances.
What will happen at present interest rates
in the renewal of certain other big loans
that are soon falling due is a mystery.
When certain States with the biggest
revenues per head on earth fail to any tiling
like meet even their current expenses. l«t
alone make some provision for debts
which they are pledged to provide for, some
people would obscurely and basely hint that
they are drunk; some would suggest u
guised insolvency; the great, aggregate
Micawber Australis merely holds to the
faith that this is a new country and every-
thing will come right. Nobody who is
numerous enough to be anybody suggests
that there should be a strenuous reforma-
tion, and that the Premier and Treasurer
who fail to make ends meet as certified by
the Government Auditor should be fired out
of office by the said Government Auditor,
and disqualified as members or Ministers
for a period proportioned to the size of
their offence. It might be a new departure
but it would be a logical one. Making ends
meet is what the Premier and Treasurer are
paid for, and if they don’t do their work
they are collecting salary under bogus pre-
tences.
* * * *
Affairs both State and Federal are being
run just now on lines which suggest Arte-
mus Ward's circus, and his prophetic kanga-
roo, described as “an amoosin’ cuss.” The
Federal Prime Minister, being struck with
an egg at Warwick (one egg in 670,500
square miles of country) has established a
special Federal police force. The State of
Queensland and the Premier thereof are taking
expensive law proceedings against the Prime
Minister about less than nothing in particu-
lar. The Premier has even demanded, at the
public expense, that the Prime Minister be
run in. Australia has had two referendums
and a general election in quick succession to
decide a Defence matter which Parliament is
paid to decide in any case. The referendums
said “No” and the election said “Yes,” and
the community said it was a great joke and
that there was nothing like it in “The
Mikado.” The Queensland Government pro-
poses to start a life assurance office, and the
New South Wales Government has a vision
of buying up all the coal-mines in the State
and paying for them with its lOU. The
Federal after nearly two years’
consideration of the wheat difficulty, proposes
to build two 5000-top ships to be finished in
about a year. The manager of State Ship-
yards is in consultation with the Common-
wealth Government .shipbuilder, and “pre-
liminary work” is to start shortly. A cable-
gram has been sent to England asking for
advice, and the president of the Inter-State
Shipbuilding Confeience is aiso g.vin,'
advice. Norway is building 127 ships, and
one single shipyard at Seattle (U.S.A.) is
building 20—only one yard among many. It
recently got together an 8000-ton ship in 64
working days. If Hughes was one-tenth as
prompt over ships as he was over that miser-
able egg at Warwick he would have a whole
fleet by this time. A British Minister has
now explained clearly—what most people
guessed long ago—that John Bull isn’t
sending any vessels to Australia for wheat so
long as Canada and the United States can
fill his ships. He hasn’t many wheat ships
available just now, and as they can do three
times the work on the short run to North
America as on the long run to Australia we
are out of the business unless we supply our
own craft. The Argentine Republic and
Africa will also get a preference. And our
wool and meat business may strike a similar
snag unless this country gets to work
at shipbuilding—cheap, hastily-constructed
wooden clippers would do —also unless
Hughes can forget his egg, and his Federal
police, and his penny dignity, and his shindy
with Ryan, and his craving to make hun-
dreds of long speeches, and his talking habits
in the press, and his buzzing-around habits,
and his kittenish custom of rushing wildly at
nothing with his coat-tail flying in the wind.
The State Premiers might, of course, do
something, but they are all too much like
Hughes.
* * * *
Ferhaps it will require a national insol-
vency to wake up the joyous Wilkins
Micawber of Australia to a knowledge of the
general decay of things. The one great satis-
faction is that Australia is still here. If the
talkative politicians in this land of unlimited
public conversation could have dug it up and
sold it piecemeal in London it wouldn’t be
here.
MRS. GRUNDY: A WORD FOR THE
OLD LADY.
Nowhere in the world has a statue been set
up to Mrs. Grundy. Liberty’s torch flames
high in the great republics, and kings in
marble and bronze look inanely over monar-
chical flower-beds and lawns ; but the emblem
of public opinion is a mockery on the lips of
the peoples—a thing to deride in shallow
epigram. Mrs. Grundy has her weaknesses
and her follies. Her eyes are too close
together, and she grasps her umbrella with
a matronly vigor a little too uncompromis-
ing ; but she is a mighty force, and a force
that in the main works towards the righteous-
ness of a fair deal. She is the power behind
the policeman, the person who puts the grip-
ping force into law, the essential strength of
all religious and moral systems, and to a
very large extent the maker of nations and
moulder of men. That she sometimes appears
narroiv and sour is due largely to the fact
that for all her splendid effort she has only
been paid with scorn and laughter; but
exalted to her true positon, honored and wor-
shipped at her true worth and crowned above
the lesser gods, she is capable of smiling
blandly, and substituting a loving and deli-
cate warning for her reproving frown and
determined interference with personal liberty.
Consider the great god Liberty with the
smoky torch and tinsel wreath as she stands
in the light of her works. She looks calm
enough as the artist for the settled republic
carves her; but how many times has she run
amok in the streets, her tangled hair flying
savagely over her half-naked shoulders, an
alcoholic madness in her eyes and her
shapely feet splashing blood to the skirts of
her ragged robe! Admitting that her assault
on the respectability of indecency and the
shames of ordered society were quite jus-
tified, who was it that roused her, lighted
her torch with the taper of hope and pointed
her road to victory? in every case the credit
of her awakening was due to Mrs. Grundy
—that plain, matronly personification of
public opinion who felt that she could stand
even the tantrums of a raging and hysterical
fury better than the smug hypocrisy of an
old well-dressed oppression. Again, when
Liberty had done her dash and, scarlet to the
knees with blood, could see nothing but blood
and more blood on her destroying course,
who arrested her progress, led her into quiet
places, put her sword away to be cleaned
and generally sobered her up and took charge
of her? In every case Mrs. Grundy— Mrs.
Grundy with a Madonna’s compassion in
her eyes for the bitter sufferings that she
saw around her. No one has wrought more
lasting service to the race of man than she.
She has put her mouth to the trumpet of
progress and blown great blasts that were
heard over land and sea; she has fought
tremendous wars and striven nobly for
peace; she has made kings and emperors and
tossed them again on the scrapheap. She
has a lot of minor mistakes to answer for;
but they were generally mistakes which were
due to some grinning jester with fate who
threw dust in her eyes. Judged by her
works, great and small, she has generally
been on the right side. Right or wrong, her
heart was always for decency and truth ; and
that is a lot more than can be said for the
rest of the minor gods.
In the tremendous world-changes that are
now impending, there are evidences that pub-
lic opinion is to take a much bigger pmce in
the scheme of things than it was allowed to
hold in the past. According to the Allies’
ideas, all communities are to be allowed the
right to choose their mode of government
and the big neighbors under whose wing and
protection they desire to live. Side by side
with this is the curious Russian develop-
ment which indicates a pretty wide-spread
desire to live under practically no govern-
ment at all. The very army of that amazing
jumble, which rightly styles itself a revolu-
tion rather than a republic, is to be of even
rank, nobody wearing so much as a stripe,
with the commander-in-chief himself issuing
advice rather than orders. Such a military
machine looks insane; but, eliminating war
itself from the programme, the application of
the idea to civil affairs may have more wis-
dom than those who snort at it suppose.
Somewhere in Gibbon’s history there is a
passage which describes the Slavonians as
living in three or four thousand villages of
the country that is now Russia unchanged
and undispossessed through all changes and
tribal upheavals of surrounding peoples. Pos-
sibly in the genius of the Russian peoples
lies a capacity for practically living without
governments and getting on just as well;
and possibly there is an underlying truth
which Russia may have to teach all peoples
that there has been a great deal too much
government in the world. But the only
thing which can take the place in any degree
of the governmental machine is public
opinion; and it is towards the permanent
enthronement of Mrs. Grundy that the new
movement works if it is going anywhere at
all. That the old lady would be a pretty
severe despot goes without argument; but
' her despotism would be inexpensive, and
after the tremendous war extravagance that
is at least a point in her favor. Clearly the
whole question of the value of the police-
man and the lawyer and the tax-collector, as
well as of the warship, the soldier and the
powder-magazine, is now under review, and
the thought of the people is being clarified
by prayer and fasting—particularly the fast-
ing. That in countries long accustomed to
all the machinery which they have deemed
essential to the communal life—apd especi-
ally in great cities where the real princi-
ples of living have been long obscured —it
seems plain enough that a good deal of the
old mechanism must remain ; but the average
man all over the world is asking himself
to-day the value of the return he has been
in the habit of receiving for the large part of
his earnings which has flowed into the vari-
ous Government treasuries. In Russia most
of the people seem to have decided that they
have been getting less than nothing; in other
lands the matter is still being debated.
» * * *
It is plain, even to people who know
nothing at all about political economy, that
the cultivation of a very few acres of good
land will yield a family all that it absolutely
requires, in return for the expenditure of a
very little toil: it is equally evident that
there are possibilities of labor co-operation
in any community which may lift the aver-
age wealth of the people to a point far
greater than any that had been reached in
any country before the war. If the existing
machines of government could be used for
the purpose of furthering that co-operation
and creating that wealth, they would obvi-
ously be worth while ; but hitherto Govern-
ments have devoted themselves to tasks
which in the main have not made the people
better off than if each man had worked his
few acres to the best advantage for the
benefit of his family without paying any
taxation or seeking the protection of any
Government at all. The inference would
seem to be that government should be re-
duced to the minimum, that unhampered by
any heavy imposts and free from compli-
cated legislation, each individual should earn
a living in bis own way, and that only thus
is the human co-operation likely to be
created which will make greater wealth and
a higher average of comfort. In a word, the
existing machinery is not only far too com-
plicated for its use, but is so bulky and
clumsy that it takes up the space of the
other machinery which is so badly needed,
and exhausts, by its dead weight, the avail-
able motive power. This being so, the big
question that has to be answered is whether
the plain force of public opinion, loosely ex-
ercised, will sufficiently safeguard the rights
of citizens and free them from bondage to
a machine which retards their real progress.
The answer to the question in a country like
Australia would seem to be found in the
little towns and scattered, rural settlements
where, in proportion to population, most real
work is done. The big towns are largely out
of the economic picture. By a better adjust-
ment of tasks three-fourths of their popula-
tion could be removed without altering their
wealth-producing value to the country as a
whole. But the small towns and scattered
settlements receive scarcely anything from
the Government in return for their contribu-
tions to the revenue. Law, in the stricter
sense, scarcely touches them, the policeman
is hardly seen there, public expenditure does
not come within many miles of them; yet
the people get on quite as \freU as if they
were gripped hard in the cogs m the govern-
ment machine. In these places Mrs. Grundy
is in a sense queen, public opinion keeps the
population in step, and that same public
opinion might make for large co-operation
and progress were it not that the Govern-
ment takes the cash and is vaguely supposed
to be doing something which it never does.
The conclusion to which the citizen viewing
these things is forced is that Australia is
very much over-governed. True, in the most
outlying places a man will be hanged if he
commits murder and put in gaol if he steals;
but all this could be managed by a few hefty
local citizens acting under stress of public
opinion just as effectively as by the central-
ised authority and without the moral inter-
vention of 14 Houses of Legislature and the
vast official armies of retainers that sur-
round them. More than this is true, for if
the habit of relying upon the supposed work
of all that vast and complicated burden we
call politics were got rid of there are lots of
other things the local Mrs. Grundy would
attempt for the general good, such as seeing
to the local health, making the local educa-
tion a reality instead of the sham it is,
arranging things on a permanent basis with
the local land monopolist, and telling the
local objectionable to wander away out into
the wilderness and plant himself where there
were no neighbors to offend. But public
opinion will not operate successfully over
very large areas. A Hughes, as Prime Min-
ister, may pledge himself not to continue in
office if a referendum vote goes wrong, and
then ignore his pledge; but if Hughes were
merely the head man of the village he could
do nothing like that. Public opinion would
hold him to his word and compel him to be
as honest as any other citizen. Old Mrs.
Grundy has great work still to do; and
given a chance, she will do it. Under the
local sway of her umbrella-sceptre Australia
might get the district pride which is the
basis of national patriotism, and the district
love of work which is the best basis for
national industry.
THE DEGRADATION OF THE
COMMON WEALTH .
If when he asseverated his intention to
stand or fall by the vote on the Conscription
issue, Hughes had wanted to be reasonably
honest, he would have put it this way:
I tell you plainly the Ministry must have this
power. Unless the Government is given this power
it cannot govern the country, and will not attempt
to do so. Instead, it will go out and come back
again in five minutes prepared to allege that it can
do what it said it could not do and ready to attempt
what it declared that it would not try.
Then there would have been a wild yeb of
derision from Cairns to Ivalgoorlie, and all


the cards being on the table the democracy
could have voted with certainty of getting a
fair deal. The reason Hughes stopped
before arriving at the last sentence or - two
was that he never yet got into the habit
of failing to-secrete an ace up his sleeve. It
is passible, of course, that not a single citizen
was deceived by the pledge. This, indeed,
stands as the one sound justification that
can be advanced by Hughes and the Phew-
sion for their persistence in barricading
themselves in the pantry—that the public
knew they were liars and that they have only
done what people expected them to do. It
requires some hide to make this defence, but
the performance of last week can be inter-
preted in no other words.
By no voluntary act will Hughes or Cook
or any of the gang ever surrender the well-
paid jobs they have their clutches on. Until
they are booted off the premises at a general
election they will hang on, whether wars be
won or lost, whether our army is reinforced
or not. The tragedy of the thing is that
honest and decent men and women, genuinely
anxious to see Australia play her part in the
war with resolute dignity, should have had
to associate themselves with the half-de-
mented and wholly-unreliable little twister
who degrades the public spirit of the Com-
monwealth every day of his life, and never
more effectively than during the last few
weeks. That he is now on the back of the
Liberals, clinging to the party organisation
like an Old Man of the Sea, is a circum-
stance for which Joe Cook is entitled to
most of the discredit. That he is even in
the picture of Australian affairs is a mourn-
ful incident in the national history, and a
sinister reminder of what can be accom-
plished under Party Government. Viewed
in this sense Hughes, hanging to office as
tightly as a dead ’possum to the limb of a
tree, is a spectacle not altogether unwelcome
if it stirs the public to a realisation of the
fly-blown materials they are depending upon
for the salvation of their democracy. Other-
wise the spectacle is revolting. The moral
sense of a man who would go through such
hocus-pocus, imagining that by this grotesque
exhibition he was keeping faith with the
people, is clearly less than that of a troglo-
dyte. A politician who would prosecute a
citizen for making “a false statement,” while
his mind was framing a proclamation of his
own unmeasurable capacity for twisting
words and evading pledges is too contempt-
ible for polite words.
What purpose was served by the farce of
going out and hopping in again, Lleaven
alone knows, unless it was to let the public
see how elastic the conscience of the Phew-
sion is and how hungry the whole crowd is
for office. Instead of redeeming the pledge
to resign the dodge merely accentuated the
breach thereof, blow the Liberal caucus
which sanctioned this monkeying with
decency came to imagine that the net result
would be anything else than to cause dis-
gust among the lookers-on is a problem The
Bulletin is not going to worry about. Nor
is The Bulletin much concerned about the
effect of the dodge having been to keep
Tudor out of the Promised Land. At the
best, under the system prevailing, Tudor
would have been an interloper who had
snehked in through a hole in the fence and
had either to run away or be arrested for
trespass. But though he has no substantial
grievance as a partisan, he should most cer-
tainly have been given assistance by the
Liberals to carry on until a general election
cleaned up the mess. It was the moral duty
of the Hughes Government to resign instead
of making a pretence thereat. It was the
constitutional duty of the Phewsion to pre-
vent a party representing but a minority
from putting on airs; and it was, and is, the
duty of the lot to get back to the electors as
expeditiously as possible. The position now
is an outrage upon self-government and a
menace to Parliament, The Legislature has
been turned into a two-up school where the
coins have heads on both sides. An election
there must be, if the existence of the Com-
monwealth is to escape the danger of clamor
for dismemberment and Parliament is to be
rescued from the log-rolling abyss it has
fallen into.
GERMAN NEW GUINEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Germans of this territory do not recog-
nise the possibility of the defeat of their
nation in Europe. Their cocksureness as
to the ultimate results is profoundly impress-
ive. Their merchants are pushing their trade
for all they are worth and making more
money than ever they did under their own
rule, an admission they freely grant; the
planters, traders and recruiters are almost
feverishly developing, trading and recruit-
ing ; and not one of them but will laugh
to scorn the idea of the German territory
one day belonging to England, or, more
directly, to the Commonwealth.
The suggestion of the last prospect sends
any German into a state of hysterical
laughter, for the contempt the average Hun
here has for the Australian is amazing.
Australia they covet as the crowning jewel
of the German colonial Empire they have
planned long since, and of which they are
as confident to-day as they were in pre-war
days. They look upon Australians not as
a nation of men, but, as one said, “a muck-
heap of human beings, dumped out of
Europe and elsewhere, lacking every qualifi-
cation that makes for national strength or
for commercial advantage”; or, as another
said, “a people that has no future, that
lives from day to day, asking big wages and
breaking the promises of to-day to ask for
lugger wages to-morrow”; or, as a third
put it, “so full of strife among tnemseUes
that when the time comes we will lap up
Australia as a dog laps up milk.” There
is not the least doubt that Australia is the
magnet of German aspiration, and when
they 40 years ago bluffed British statesmen
into allowing them the possession of Ger-
man New Guinea, they then clearly saw
the strategic importance of the step—saw
that a great deal more clearly than they
realised the great richness and immense
possibilities of New Guinea. That territory
has been a watch tower, as it were, and not
one German official but has studied Aus-
tralia with the one ambition —to lay hands
on the land.
The decision in the first referendum on
conscription is still spoken of in German
New Guinea as proof of Australian insensi-
bility to the dangers of the future. They do
not gloat over the failure as an indication
that Australians are in sympathy with them
or desire an urgent peace at any price ; they
despise them rather. The following, taken
from a German magazine, written by that
amiable person, Maxmilian Harden, will
show the German mind in this matter. The
magazine was the Zukunft, picked up
from a German planter’s table: —
We have the greatest contempt possible for any
human to possess for the Australian, doing as little
work as he can, spending his substance in con-
cubinage, in sport, in gambling (which is his
religion) and in drinking. We who can claim to
be honest laugh at the Quixotic bravery of the Aus-
tralian whose enthusiasm carried him away to face
our Gon-led army.. . .We will break the hearts of
unionists for all time. We are gratified at the
success of our agents in Australia and the power
of German gold. Those Germans who, like Judas,
have turned against the Fatherland in its hour of
trial will be suitably dealt with. Those who have
stood firm and are now interned will be placed over
their captors and in high administrative positions.
....The Australians are the most ignorant people in
the wide world. They cannot speak or write cor-
rectly the British language. Our propaganda in the
land of the Southern Cross has been most successful.
... .We will scatter them over the face of the earth,
whilst we will retain in Australia their women to
be mothers of a new German race in the great
Pacific.
The first referendum produced those re-
marks so full of love and goodwill. It will
be interesting to rpad German magazines on
the last decision.
There is not one planter’s, trader’s or
merchant’s home but has a library> and
always you will find volumes on Australia,
its people, its trade and its resources. On
the walls will be found maps and pictorial
encyclopaedias, and these will show the latest
extensions of railway lines and roads;
varying colors denote farming, pastoral and
mining districts; figures show acreage, num-
bers of stock, and prospective mineral
wealth. These people know more of Aus-
tralia than the average Australian. And
they believe it to be a more desirable place
to possess.
It seems to be unrealised by most Aus-
tralians that German New Guinea is still
owned by Germany and governed by Ger-
man laws. The Australian military admin-
istration is merely in occupation, and with
very limited powers. The terms of this
occupation, assented to by England, are
honoi-ably fulfilled. In themselves they do
not carry any implication whatever that
eventually the territory will pass into Aus-
tralian hands. The Germans never con-
template such a change. Lloyd George’s
idea of a referendum of the natives, as to
the disposal of the territory, should the
Allies triumph, is, of course, a queer piece
of absurdity. But in that connection it is
well to remember that the Germans, even
the German missionaries, have never ceased
to impress on the natives that one day the
German Governor will come back. Cer-
tainly this is an offence, and several Ger-
mans have been sent to the N. S. Wales
internment camp for it; but it still goes on,
and Lloyd George’s referendum might have
a surprising result.
There has been some criticism of the
Australian administration in German New
Guinea. But usually it has been traceable
to personal grievance. Certainly promo-
tions are of the comic-opera kind: the
humble lieutenant goes to his cot at night
to find himself in the morning on the high
road to an administrative field-marshal-
ship. But in all fairness it is impossible to
find serious fault with the official record of
Samuel Pethebridge, the Administrator.
When it is considered that this administrator
—-Australian born and trained, by the way—
on his arrival in German New Guinea found
chaos such as might and would have dis-
mayed many a capable man; found revenues
and their channels destroyed; ’ found the
Germans sullen, treacherous, and attempt-
ing risings almost every day for months;
found trade smashed, and the whole pros-
pects of the territory so blighted that it did
not seem worth an effort to restore it—-
when these things are remembered and the
position to-day is considered, there can be
no question that good work has been done. Not
only has every previous channel of revenue
been restored, but new ones have been added,
until the annual revenues are practically
double what they ever were in the German
days. These revenues carry on the territory
and entail no direct charge on the Common-
wealth for administration. By tact, combined
with firmness, the Administrator has
settled definitely the restlessness of the
Germans; they admit they are getting a
fair deal, such as they might expect under
British military occupation. People in
criticism of the Administration have
demanded the internment of all Germans.
They have made that demand because they
have not understood the terms of the
occupation.
There is also this feature of the admin-
istration that adds lustre to it: not only was
order gotten from chaos, but the Administra-
tion was formed from a medley of men, of
all ages, ranks and qualifications—mostly
middle-aged to old men; bankers and
laborers, doctors and shop-assistants. Yet
every department to-day is showing ability
and working smoothly. Australians may be
proud of their first efforts at military ad-
ministration.
I cannot forbear to specially mention the
work of Colonel (Dr.) Strangman, whose
disappearance in the Matunga has been the
cause of much regret. He had waged war
against malaria with such success that
Rabaul, the chief centre of the German terri-
tory. is now one of the cleanest and safest
parts of all the Pacific. I add to this
praiseworthy effort the backing the' Admin-
istration has given to Colonel Strangman’s
ideals by compelling the Germans all over
the territory to provide better conditions for
health-preserving, especially for the benefit
of native workers. In the same direction the
Administration is employing itself to the
lessening of the awful ravages of venereal
disease among the natives; and on this score
alone if '+ f>ad to retire to-morrow it would
do so with honor.
From my personal point of view the weak
spot in the Administration is the sudden and
undue amount of freedom that is allowed the
native. This has already put him out of
hand, and promises to ruin him. Unin-
structed British public opinion demands,
however, that the native must be pampered,
and this influences the Administration; but
a day is coming when we shall grieve over
the results.
THOS J. McMAHON.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Speech from the Dock.
Challenged by a direct motion of No Con-
fidence when the Reps, met on Friday last,
Hughes was compelled to make whatever
justification he had for the betrayal of the
pledge given in what he himself had declared
to be “the most critical hour of the national
life.” And when he faced the job Hughes
was speaking, not to Tudob nor to the Legis-
lature, but to the people of Australia. It is
to them the pledge was made. It is they
whose judgment in this business counts. For
that reason all that Hughes had to say
about the character of Tudob’s indictment
was without point. The pledge was not one
as betiveen factionists or partisans. It
mattered nothing whether Tudob or the
Labor party generally has acted or spoken
foolishly or wisely. What did matter was
whether Hughes had a plausible excuse for
a deliberate act of evasion. And what was
certain when he finished was that he had
none. He simply said: “Here I was. Here
I am. Here I stick.” There is not a single
word in the long, frothy rigmarole to excul-
pate either himself or his party from the
charge of conduct so base as to be without
parallel in the political history of the Com-
monwealth. Instead, we now have it that
the pledge was an imposture from birth. The
allegation that the government could not be
carried on unless he and his friends proved
their treachery is a manifest untruth. A
new Ministry could easily have proceeded
with the contract if Hughes and his Minis-
ters had been honest men instead of greedy
partisans. The invitation to “collaborate”
with men who had been denounced as liars
and German agents could only come from a
man who supposed that the moral sense of
Australia had been banished to the garbage-
tip. From the day that Hughes succeeded
Fisiieb The Bulletin warned Australia
what to expect. It knew the man. It is
satisfied that everybody else does now.

Maoriland’s Noblest Borrower.
In Maoriland Treasurer Joe Wabd has a
certain popular regard as “a clever finan-
cier” and “a great man with figures”—a
reputation not difficult to live up to in a
community of which about 90 per cent, takes
its arithmetic on trust, while the remainder
is satisfied to help itself to the gravy.
Giving the adjective an offensive meaning
Joe is a clever financier. He is a boomster
whose policy for 20 years has been the pro-
motion of “prosperity”—for banking insti-
tutions, landlords and mortgagees. But if
financial ability be interpreted to imply
some acquaintance with the economic
thought of the world and a comprehension
of the relationship between public and pri-
vate finance and the social and national
problems of his generation, it is a solemn
fact that Joseph Wabd is worth less than
2d. The man simply has no ideas, and to
read one of his public utterances is to
become bogged in a mass of words exasper-
atingly barren of meaning. His remarks
about war loans and taxation were until
lately entitled to first prize for banality;
but what he had to say the other day about
the exemption of war loans from income tax
beats them. Asked to defend the policy of
exemption and to show how John Gkice,
chairman of the National Bank of Aus-
tralia, was wrong in combating this policy,
Wabd fired off a long rigmarole of which
the essential points were: (1) That the
position was difficult; (2) that money had
to be obtained to win the war; (3) that
most people had not been called upon to
contribute anything to the war expenditure
except through a duty of 3d. a pound on
tea; (4) that this contribution did not go
towards paying for the war, anyway, but to
increase old age pensions; (5) that if in-
come tax was charged on revenue from war
loans the rate of interest would have to be
increased, whereupon all interest rates
would go up, and that would be the begin-
ning of a financial panic. Most of this is,
of course, irrelevant. The rest of it is
inaccurate. The whole of it is twaddle.
Floating tax-free loans at 4-1 per cent, does
not mean that interest is “kept down.” It
means that the interest rate available to
large investors is substantially increased.
Compared with the proceeds of an invest-
ment subject to taxation the yield from a
tax-free investment at 4J per cent, goes
up to 5, 6 and 7 per cent, according to the
income derived—and it is the big investors
whose money makes the millions. Wabd
does not justify this. Nor does he attempt
to meet the further objections to this sur-
reptitious nourishment of Fat —that the
removal of a huge volume of Capital invest-
ment from the area of taxation is a gross
outrage upon all other taxpayers, and that
the presentation of a bond free not only
from the taxation of to-day, but immune
from the taxation of to-morrow, is in time
of war a scandalous act of preference. It
means a gift of something that is not only
valuable at the moment but of incalculable
value in the future. The result must inevit-
ably be to make every addition to the
taxation on income earned subsequently by
other people have the effect of increasing
the capital value of the tax-free investment,
increase the return therefrom and throw a
greater and greater burden upon those who
work for the special benefit of those who
do not. There is no getting away from
this. There iS.no argument by which such
folly—if folly it redly is, and not a mere
trick —can be excused.
The Mystery about Coal.
The time is a bit more than ripe for the
N. S. Wales Government to make a full
statement of its relations with the Newcastle
coal-owners, its position wdtli reference to
mines that are being “worked by the Govern-
ment’’ and the terms of any contracts or
business understandings entered into between
the Treasury and colliery proprietors. Ex-
cept for a few bald assertions regarding “con-
trol” made during the strike the public Ims
been told nothing about what has been going
on. The Bulletin can conceive only one
reason for secrecy, and that is an even more
powerful reason for publicity. It is not the
habit of Governments to work in holes and
corners unless something is happening that
they are not anxious to let the public hear
about. And when Governments are detected
doing this the public is generally justified in
taking the precaution to hold its nose. The
latest occurrence in connection with the
Newcastle mines calls for an immediate lift-
ing of the curtain. After a visit to N. S.
Wales by the Victorian Minister of Mines
Downward, it transpired that a contract
had been entered into with the Holman
Government to supply Victoria with
1,000.000 tons of coal annually for five years
from the Pelaw and Richmond Main mines,
owned by J. and A. Brown, at 15s. a ton
f.o.b. The price agreed upon was exorbitant.
No tenders were called for supplies from
other mines. To carry out the contract
shipping would have had to be commandeered
to shift Brown’s coal. And the result of
turning 1,000,000 tons out of the Brown
mines would have been to throw other mines
idle and start a rumpus, and probably a
strike, over the number of shifts. There
was, of course, a yell, the contract was re-
jected by the Victorian Ministry, and
George Fuller. N.S.W. Chief Secretary,
was heard remarking that “he did. not under-
stand” why the agreement had been annulled.
Now, there are obviously many features
about this business which should not be sup-
pressed, the first and most important being
the general connection between J. and A.
Brown and the N. S. Wales Government
and the arrangement relating to the particu-
lar deal under notice. If it is part of a
“Win-the-War” Ministry’s policy to achieve
victory by enriching Brown, the electors
ought to hear about it. And. incidentally,
they ought to be told whether a further part
of that policy is to promote strikes.
«
The Everlasting Libel-monger.
There are people in Australia to whom the
attractiveness of stinking fish seems eternal.
If they can find even the shadow of an
excuse for raising a yelp about the “selfish-
ness” or the “godlessness” or the “immoral-
ity” of the Australian people they start
howling in assured confidence of getting
the noise repeated in the newspapers. There
was an illustration of this last week in the
parsonical orations incidental to a Week of
Prayer conducted in a Sydney hall. _ If the
reports of the proceedings are a fair guide
to what happened it would appear that
most of the time was occupied in listening
to disordered declamation about the
“uncleanliness” of the local beaches, the
prevailing habit which leads to every citi-
zen being drunk all the week and under the
table on Sundays, the perils of illegitimacy,
and so on. It all seems like a description
of Sodom and Gomorrah. And these wild
tirades, delivered without either sense of
proportion or restraint, were apparently
listened to without protest. One individual
in an inky suit sprang in a frenzied moment
to the front with this declamatory roar: —
Selfishness is everywhere. God has given us the
best land under Heaven, and from the highest to
the lowest in our land we are stamped with selfish-
ness. We must give. We must replace selfishness
with sacrifice. Australia must take herself and
fling herself into the lap of God. and, from the
Government to the humblest of the people, serve
God in the spirit of sacrifice. Australia must save
her national soul. ‘ .
What in the name of Heaven is the meaning
of a burst of fevered language like this?
Where does it lead to? What does it sug-
gest in the way of individual behavior and
collective conduct? The Bulletin leaves,
the conundrum to someone else. But in
the meantime it would solemnly urge the
next parson who feels called upon to testify
before the Lord and the reporters to take a
firm grip of himself and have a look at the
landscape through the right end of the tele-
scope. Then perhaps he may find out that
it is grotesquely untrue to speak of Aus-
tralian men and women as if they were an
immoral, drunken lot of wasters. To deny
that there is immorality both in the conven-
tional sense and in the wider sphere of
human relationship would be absurd. But
it would be more absurd to imagine that
Australia is singularly unfortunate in this
respect or that the war against the evil
features of society is not waged as strenu-
ously by Australians as by any other people
on earth. The evils of drunkenness and
prostitution are admitted by everyone, but
they are not removed or even palliated by
merely yelling about them or treating them
as isolated phenomena. To a large extent
the problems raised by them are the prob-
lems of the slum, of the industrial system,
of education and of heredity. And who is
there can justly say that in Australia the
struggle to raise the standard of living, of
thought and of conduct has been carried on
with less enthusiasm than elsewhere? To
say that “selfishness” is lurking about the
premises is about as helpful as to remark
that the summer frocks are suggestive of
feminine vanity. Of course there is selfish-
ness everywhere. The social conditions we
live among are based on selfishness. They
have their roots in a system which recog-
nised that the first man to grab the bone
was the one to gnaw the meat off. But in no
comparative sense is selfishness an Aus-
tralian characteristic. No people give more
generously. The jaundiced looker-on may
see indications of selfish characteristics in
the Conscription vote. But can any be seen
in the spirit which brought the Australian
army into being? Can any be seen in the
army itself? Nowhere in the world is there
finer' matesliip; and at rockbottom mate-
ship is unselfishness.

The German’s Punch and the Allies’
Pantry.
Now which is more likely to be correct —a
statement made the other day by British
Ambassador Buchanan or one attributed to
the Russian Ambassador at Paris? Accord-
ing to Buchanan, Russia has finished as an
active power in this war, whereas Mackla-
koff asserts that “Germany is retaining the
greater part of her army on the Eastern
Front.” In spite of all the confused evidence
concerning Ivan, this paper is more in-
clined to back the Englishman’s yarn than the
other fellow’s. There seems no reason for
even hoping that Russia may again become
a serious factor in the disturbance, nor any
for imagining that the German view differs
from Buchanan’s. A section of the popula-
tion may fight, after a fashion, to defend the
Revolution. Also annexation may provoke bitter
resentment, though, as the territories which
Germany desires have been thoroughly Teu-
tonised, there is a good deal of doubt about
that. But Russia as a nation can hardly be
said to exist, and organisation for war now-
adays is something different from getting
ready for a football match. At any rate, the
story that the enemy is compelled to now
keep as many soldiers and guns in front of
the Russian as he had to when Brussiloff
persisted in making a real fight of it is
incredible. There are far bigger issues at
'stake on the Italian and French fronts and
scores of reasons why the German should
have as much of himself thereabouts as is
possible. That he will struggle to admini-
ter a heavy blow in both places at the earli-
est opportunity appears to be certain; and
while there is plenty of justification for ex-
pecting the Allies to resist defeat, there is
none for thinking that the job will be easy.
Meantime the figures relating to ships and
submarines and the details available about
the food supply in Britain are no more joy-
ful than before. An incidental detail is the
prevailing speculation as to whether J. Bull
will buy this season’s Australian wheat-cr p.
As John already owns many millions more
bushels of Australian wheat than he can
transport, and as he has just bought the
Argentine crop the prospects are not cheer-
ful. And for next season’s harvest they are
less cheerful still. Yes; the war is, after
all, quite a serious business. Australia may
even discover that it will stand some hard
thinking about.
The Vanishing Wheatfields.
A vanishing wlieatfield is one of the big-
gest problems that face Australian Govern-
ments. In N. S. Wales, for instance, after
the big spurt in 1915-16, the area shrank
some 25 per cent. This season it is esti-
mated officially that it has dropped another
15 per cent., but outside experts think the
reduction heavier. In Victoria the area this
year is 238,003 acres less. Hundreds more
cockies are now reckoning that if they cannot
get ss. a bushel guaranteed, they had
better throw the plough on the scrap-
heap ; and the general feeling is that the
man who nuts in a larger area than he can
handle without depending upon outside
labor is looking for trouble. Seemingly a
bait of some sort must be hung out to keep
the area from continued decrease. In sup-
port of a guarantee of ss. a bushel for the
next three years, the cockies point out that
in Maoriland the Government has guaranteed
its growers ss. lOd. a bushel; that U.S.A.
and Canada will give 2dol. 25 cents per
bushel, equal to over 9s. per bushel f.0.b.;
and that Britain has fixed a guarantee on a
sliding scale for the next six years, starting
this year with 725. per quarter (9s. a
bushel). But M.L. grows only about enough
for local requirements, the position in Great
Britain is obvious, while the U.S.A. has no
Avlmat to spare, and in any case it and
Canada are much closer to the big markets
than we are. Apart from the problem of
financing a future five-shilling guarantee,
what are we going to do with the wheat?
After this crop is taken off there will be
something like six million tons of grain piled
up in Australia, and most of it is likely to
stop here for years. The silos to be built
will hold only a handful of it. The wheat
cannot be held in stacks without deteriora-
tion. Is it a business proposition,_ then, to
guarantee sufficient to produce a big crop—
unless, of course, the British Government
wants us to grow and take a chance in
hoarding the wheat here, which means, of
course, that John Bull must find the
money. The horrible mistake we have made
is in devoting almost all our attention to
wood-and-water-joey jobs—including wool-
growing and wheat-growing—and letting
manufactures slide. To-day, because the
ocean is not open to us, we can’t get rid of
the wheat that we must sell 12,000 miles
away, and we can’t procure the manufac-
tures that we must mostly drag the same
distance. The foreign-traders and low-
tariffists have between them landed us in a
nice bog. Yet we still let them bluff us into
giving them the largest places of power and
authority. We deserve all the disaster that
comes to us.
Here is the sort of question that shouldn’t
need asking; and still The Bulletin can’t
answer it. The Chambers of Manufactures
ought to see to it promptly. The letter, by
the way, comes from Brisbane: —
In a month or two I intend setting up a dugout of
my own ; and as it is also my intention to put every-
thing in the place, as far as I am able, of Aus-
tralian manufacture (we are both Australians, and
yours truly has “done in” a leg over Australia
already, but doesn’t mind doing in a bit of cash
over her either), I am desirous of knowing if there
is any kind of book or pamphlet (Government or
otherwise) which will give a list of Australian firms
making any or every kind of article for domestic
use. In this town shop-people look blankly at you
if you ask for Australian goods. Hence my appeal
to you. If you can get the information for me I
don’t mind paying you for your trouble.
“ Don't mind paying yon for your trouble /”
This is from a man who has just cheerfully
lost a leg for Australia and now wants to
spend his money on Australian furnishings
for his Australian bride! And last week
there was a parson in Sydney raving about
the selfishness of Australians !
Why all this mystery about Hughes going
to London again? It has been known for
weeks past that representatives from over-
sea have been asked to attend another con-
ference with the Cold Country Government.
The Maoriland Government has made no
secret of it. Hughes is anxious to go and
will go—a circumstance which all along
made the fate of the pledge a certainty.
As things stand at the moment—they will
pretty certainly stand somehow quite dif-
ferently within a day or two —the Peake
Ministry in S. Aus. has to sit in judgment
on the land-deals of the Vaughan Ministry
which preceded it; and half of the Vaughan
co. forms half of the Peake coalition. Styles,
the ex-Minister chiefly blamed in the report
of the Commission, has resigned as a matter
of honor, though declaring fiercely and at
great length that the report is absurd and
ought to be reviewed by a real Judge, which
he does not allow Noel Webb (who was the
Commission) to be. The old original Labor
party sits back and asks why Blundell and
Jackson, the other two members of the pre-
sent Ministry who were also Vaughan’s
colleagues, do not resign as well. At the
very same unfortunate moment, Liberals
and “Nationals” are getting together to dis-
cuss some sort of coalition for the coming
elections, as well as for a mere Ministry. At
latest advices they were entirely unable to
agree, and will be probably running candi-
dates against each other, to the great joy
of Labor. An alternative scheme is to put
off the elections altogether for a time; but
that bit of treachery to the people would
take any quantity of engineering to put
through.
“Wart” : The B.M.A.’s boycott of the Tas-
manian hospitals is beginning to get in its
work. The Launceston Hospital, whose
usual staff consists of a surgeon-superin-
tendent, a house surgeon and an assistant,
with a few honoraries, is now down to sur-
geon-superintendent and one country doctor
who comes in for a couple of days a week.
In the first place the honoraries resigned,
and after them the house surgeons; then
the B.M.A. picketed the job, and there have
been no “loyalists” or “scabs” thus far, so
the institution has had to shut down
its out-patients’ department and restrict in-
patients to urgent cases. The chief cause
of the strike is that the hospital takes well-
to-do patients and charges them fees. But
why not? At the root of the matter is the
“charity” idea and the practice of accepting
the service of honorary doctors. If the
State paid every surgeon and physician for
their work, as it should, they would have. no
occasion to growl. A hospital is an institu-
tion organised for the treatment of disease ;
and to deny the moderately or even the im-
moderately well-to-do the right to the bene-
fits of that organisation is absurd.
The N. S. Wales Public Service Board,
put on to the job, finds that since the war
began £104,000 has been spent on monkey-
cages, etc., at Sydney’s new Zoo in defiance
of the law. Of course, nobody will be
punished. No politician will even lose his
job over it. Nothing will happen—except
that the same thing will happen again. The
misapplication of the money went on under
the nose of Parliament. But it was “part of
the game,” and no member took any notice.
The Bulletin called for an inquiry into
this disgraceful expenditure of money in
wartime nearly two years ago; and there
hasn't been one yet. For the Public Service
Board inquiry merely touches the surface of
the matter. The whole business stinks of
political bribery and corruption. The little
body which ran the old Zoo got hold of
Taronga Park and proceeded to make a new
Zoo in a modest, economical way. After it
had been at work for some months a number
of men were thrown out of their Govern-
ment jobs at the new abattoirs, etc. They
told the Holman Labor Government that it
would have to find work for them. They
were assured that there was work in the
country. “No good to us,” they said. “You’ll
have to find us work near town.” And the
Government, to retain the support of these
men, chased round to find something for
them to do. It jumped at the chance the
new Zoo offered—and that is, briefly, the
disgraceful story of how £104,000 (and well
on to another £lOO,OOO besides) came to be
spent at and in connection with the Zoo in
defiance of the law which says that works
estimated to cost over £20,000 must go to
the Public Works Committee for inquiry and
report.
“Croson”: While skirmishing round after
the odd ha’pennies that Peacock couldn’t
save, Premier Bowser was hit by the stag-
gering fact that Beecliworth Gaol, with a
governor, an assistant and five warders, was
being maintained for the —er —benefit of
one lonely prisoner. If Beecliworth doesn’t
misbehave more frequently he threatens to
close the institution and shift the staff —
and the prisoner—to Pentridge. But even
that would be only one small step. Private
Enterprise has never had a fair chance in
treating malefactors. I reckon that if I
had the services of a daily average of 300
prisoners in return for providing them
merely with plain food, coarse clothing, a
very simple bed and the guardianship of a
score or so of warders, and was allowed to
work them 12 hours a day or thereabouts, 1
would have to pay a heavy income tax. I
admit that before very long the supply of
“cheap labor” would probably fall to nearly
zero —but that is the main object of our
penal system, isn’t it?
Plaving received his instructions from the
Labor party, Lloyd George has cut out the
old “Never again” talk. The fact, of course,
is that the Allies are largely depending upon
something happening in Germany very like
Avhat has happened in Russia, and it would
be madness to expect a working-class cry for
peace in Germany if peace meant that the
Allies were going to starve Fritz. So, instead
of the old talk about “economic isolation,”
the new promise to the German working-man
is that there shall be, no economic war. Then
what about Australia? Obviously this makes
it more necessary than ever to get on at
once with tariff reform, if only to hold the
industries which the war has enabled us to
start. Hughes’s old talk about pulling up
upas trees and cutting out cancers goes for
nothing. “No economic war” —that means
“business as usual” ; and within a month of
peace it is just about as certain as anything
can be that Germany will be booking orders
for the old goods and offering them a bit
cheaper to get back its trade. Only one
thing will save our baby industries and
enable us to start new ones, and that is a
high tariff.
Sands’ Directory, the Sydney business-
man’s reliable old finger-post, makes its 48th
appearance with all the old features pre-
served when they haven’t been improved. It’s
a worrying time for Browne-Smythe, who
adheres to the principle that it is cheaper to
move than pay rent, when Sands’ Direc-
tory makes its appearance and tells his old
grocer and butcher where he is hiding.
From Gordon Gummow, gent, one: —
Re Metzler changing his name to Martin in accord-
ance with kingly precedent (B. 3/1/T8). It might
be inferred from the par. that he was convicted for
doing it. As a fact, he was discharged. It is a
weird tangle. Metzler’s father was born in what
was then French territory, and while he was doing
missionary work for Britain he begat at Jaffa a
son who was born to be the defendant. The son has
hit practically every country on earth, so much so
that a layman would shy at determining his nation-
ality. Two circumstances saved him the other day.
He was allowed to give evidence as to pedigree (one
of the few matters on which hearsay evidence is
admissible—usually without fear of contradiction)
and he proved he was a British subject. He had
been in England with his dad between the ages of
three and six, and his dad at some period or other
obtained a Certificate of Naturalisation in the U.K.
That was good enough for the Bench to decide that
he was a British subject, and therefore not guilty,
despite the fact that he had resided in Germany fox-
many years. But apart from that, the facts showed
that Metzler-Martin had been inventing all kinds
of horrible devices to defeat Germany, and placing
them before the Commonwealth Government.
The thin little excuse that was to give
N. S. Wales Attorney-General Hall a trip
to America melted through Canada decid-
ing for Conscription. It was just little
David’s luck to find fruit turned to ashes
that way. Something like this happened
last session. Jabez Wright, member for
Broken Hill, had struck an Abraham
Lincoln attitude and was talking at large.
“I consider,” says Jabez, “the Attorney-
General a necessity.” Here was a stun-
ning compliment from an unexpected quar-
ter. Then—“ Necessity knows no law,”
drawled Jabez.
The Earnest Believer is sometimes an
embarrassment to the leaders of a sect which
keeps one eye fixed on the next world and
one on this. The Sydney Methodies were
doing their bit on the Day of Prayer speci-
ally set apart for Winning the War. One
clerical gent, was speaking while two reli-
gious heavyweights, past presidents of the
Central Mission, beamed approvingly on the
platform; and a lady Methodist who doesn’t
approve of a profitable business arrange-
ment chose that moment of all others to
begin praying aloud for the fellow-religion-
ists who let the sainted Lyceum Hall, in
Pitt-street, to moving-picture people. The
speaker tried to go on ; but the lady had a
penetrating voice and refused to modulate
it. So a hymn was called for, and the
Voice of Conscience was drowned with
praises of the Lord.
The list of new names for places in S.
Aus. bearing German titles has been settled.
It differs widely from the suggestions made
by the committee of three (E. M. Smith,
Rodney Cockburn and Talbot) which was
instructed by the Vaughan Government to
substitute native names only. Peake has a
fancy for war names instead. The chief ex-
ception is Lobethal, known by its woollen
factory; this gets the sensible name of
Tweedvale. Petersburg becomes Peter-
borough, Grunthal is now Verdun, and Blum-
berg Birdwood. There are many other
changes among less well-known places; in
particular, the north and south Rhine be-
come the Somme and the Marne, ard the
way-back Kaiserstuhl is Mount Kitchener.
Further changes which will cause some re-
gret are those that wipe out the names of
good old State servants of Teutonic origin—
some of them still living. The “hundreds”
of Homburg, Schomburgk, Basedow, Krich-
auff and Von Doussa disappear in this way.
According to the latest communique from
the scene of action in Victoria, where the
lodge doctors are battling with the friendly
societies for a rise of a bob or two per
annum, seven applications for the job of per-
manent lodge doctor have been received by
those in charge of the societies’ arrangements
at Geelong, the first centre to make a start
with its own medical institute. The doctors
willing to embrace the friendly societies
without the blessing of holy 8.M.A.. are
located in five different States, only Tas-
mania being unrepresented in the list of
applicants. This looks like first blood to the
lodges—though, considering that it is the
wage-earning class which usually belongs to
such bodies, the latter are hardly to be con-
gratulated oh their success.
“S. Pallida”: Victoria has a Venereal
Diseases Act, but police magistrates are
powerless to apply its provisions. And,
apparently, nobody worries about such cases
as that which came before Notley Moore,
P.M., at Melbourne City Court, when a
waitress who arrived from Maoriland a
month ago was charged with vagrancy.
According to Policelady Connor, the
woman was venereally infected. She was
detained for medical treatment, of course?
Nothing of the sort —she was discharged,
and at this present is probably in a restau-
rant handing plates of variegated tucker to
unsuspecting customers ! “We cannot send
this woman to gaol,” said the beak. “There
is a Venereal Diseases Act, but no machin-
ery for carrying it out. We would like to
protect the public, but” — Here the police-
prosecutor chipped in with the remark that
persons suffering from defendant’s complaint
were, he understood, prohibited from work-
ing in places where food was sold. But the
beak explained that there were no means of
enforcing the prohibition. So the way to
Hell is still wide open and smoothly paved
with good intentions.
From the Gallery :
Of all the actors in the recent pantomime George
Wise, of Gippsland, remains most eminent in my
memory. Early in the proceedings he became
affected with an itch to worship W. M. Hughes, and
hastened to disclose his obsession in showers of
superlatives. In his view Hughes was a tempera-
mental haggis of Napoleon and Northcliffe, with a
dash of Martin Luther and Haroun al Raschid, and
in private or political quality combined the integrity
of a cash-register with the infallibility of the Most
High. He hurried about in the lobbies like a dis-
cordant blowfly, his small coat-tails flying and his
arms elaborating his stained-glass views of Mr.
Hughes. And the result of all his cheerful spruiking
was the honor of being sent for ! Yes, the Governor-
General, finding the Ship of State sinking and the
crew down with the mumps, plugged the leak with
one hand and frantically signalled for Pilot Wise
with the other. It was a great day for George—the
greatest day he will ever see. After a few minutes’
pow-wow with the G.-G., the former leader of a
party of one retired into his old niche. The G.-G.
had sent for him —but Hughes didn’t.

Our Instructors have arranged a Special Class for those desirous of serving the Empire in the Army.
The Tuition extends over four months —Instruction three evenings a week. The course will be made

“Turn to the Bight” came back to Sydney
Palace in Bolls-Royce style last Saturday.
Sweet, gentle, sugary “Maw,” champion jam-
maker of the United States, is as trying as
ever to the cynic; but there is only a cynic
and a quarter to the acre in a sentimental
Yank audience. The most admirable thing
in the slick little best-seller is the crashing
climax of the old-home act, when the village
Shylock, coming to foreclose on the farm
and peach-orchard,
is un e x pectedly
paid off with the
money the safe-
breaking crook has
just taken from
Shy lock’s own
grocery store, and
is then bustled out
by the pickpocket,
who goes through
the unpopular
man’s clothes in
the process. Money
is the mainspring
of the whole mess,
and in the heavily-
iced last act it
fairly blows a gale
of dollar-bills. The
reformed crooks
are all dressed up
and have nice girls
to go to, and the
new auto-mo-beel is
seen in the dis-
tance taking the
wedded hero and
“Turn to the Right,”
at Sydney Palace.

The co. presents the dramatic pot of jam

The box-office at Sydney Majesty’s is feel-
ing like the best kid of the family. The
city has been stirred by the news that “The
Bing Boys Are Here,” and there are always
some people in the theatre who have paid to
stand. Nothing delights a showman more
than to see an honest armchair citizen try-
ing to do the flamingo trick; it is a sign
of good show weather when the human bird
stands on one leg for hours at a time.

The J.C.W. children’s panto., “The House
that Jack Built,” will come to an end at
the Royal (Sydney) on Saturday night, and
the cow with the crumpled horn will hang
herself up by the tail in the property-room
till next Christmas.

Peter Pan Macdonell will cease from
pirating on Friday at the Criterion (Syd-
ney), and on the following night the popu-
lar actress will produce “Outcast,” playing
the part of Miriam —one of her best.
Robinson Crusoe continues to do so with
much success at the Grand Opera House
(Sydney), and by all appearances Man
Friday has got a long job in front of him at
union wages.

The early Greeks and Romans made use
of beans in taking the votes of the people.
So does Bilanderson at Sydney Hippo-
drome, where he grows his own beanstalk
and has the assistance of Jack as returning-
officer. The questions put to the populace
were (1) Is this a bright and merry panto?
(2) Do you think the principal boy, Mabelle
Morgan, straighter than Billy Hughes? So
far, the Yessers are leading by 21 pecks one
pint.

Ada Reeve ceases fire at Sydney Tivoli
on Friday in “Winnie Brooke, Widow.” On
Saturday the bill will present a new mixed
front, with baritone Peter Dawson’s name
most prominent. Soprano Anette George
and the Creole Fashion Plate (a somewhat
tiresome mystery this) supply the other
turns. The rest of the evening will be
taken up by Bob Greig and Beatrice
Holloway’s acrobatic three-act “Baby Mine.”
Wallace Held and Eugene Pallette hold
the screen in “The World Apart” showing at
Hoyt’s Sydney house. It has a quick-action
plot, and includes all the thrills incident to
life in a “Western” mining town. At the same
address Pauline Frederick is putting fine
acting into “Double Crossed.” At the Cry-
stal Palace, that bit of quicksilver, Olive
Thomas, once more dances her way to
favor, making “Indiscreet Corinne” a
bewitching little vampire. The Lyceum fea-
ture, “The Woman Beneath,” is redeemed
only by Ethel Clayton’s brightness and
charming frocking; while across the Strand
sheet Balkan royalty plots and counter-
plots, and George Walsh scales the palace
walls and shows ’em “The Yankee Way.”

“The Story of the nosary” has brought
another week of war to Melbourne Prin-
cess's, but the venue has changed to Strel-
sau, where excited armies,‘about 15 strong,
strew the landscape with their rainbow
dead. Colonel Bob Inman heads Strelsau’s
rush on the enemy entanglements, anu am
voice of command assays a pound of molasses
to every word. Of the junior officers Cap-
tain Vivian Edwards keeps his nose nearest
to the barrage; he is then mislaid for about
two acts, while his sudden midnight bride con-
tributes a rainstorm to the general gloom.
Vivian’s wife this trip is Miss Marie Ney,
a tall and graceful novice who has
a sweet disposition, but needs to double her
output of soprano. The young lady is
hurried into matrimony by Arthur Styan,
who is fastened to the role of Father
Theodore and visibly frets at his moorings.
The same old Peterkin (Henri Dore) has
his former supporter (Elwyn Harvey) in a
frontal attack on the fortune of Nicodemus
Winkle, who is now a drivelling ancient
from comedian George Scully’s gallery. Allan
Wilkie again plays the reformed boozer, Karl
Larose, under the pseudonym of McHaggis,
so to speak, whilst the previous villain,
Walter Hunt, butts into the gamble for the
big feminine prize like one who holds a
royal flush. The show apparently finishes
to-morrow, and as the advt. is silent about
anything to follow, the presumption is that
the Princess’s will shut up for a while.
** * *
At Melbourne Majesty’s the career of
“Whittington” knows no checks, save those
for passing to and fro at squash-time. A
warm summer—the first the city has experi-
enced for several years—attempted to get
the local pantos, down, but they beat the
temperature. In fact, J.C.W.’s show im-
proves in the running. One doesn’t as a
rule think of the panto, stage as a promising
field for musical and histrionic culture; yet
there has been a considerable artistic
development in “Dick Whittington.” For
instance, the later scenes in Act 1. The
poor stuff that Bantock and Langford have
to talk, whilst stage-hands are busy behind
the front cloth, is treated as humorously as
could be; and the duet between Vera Pearce
and Pauline Bindley—“By and bye you will
miss me”—has been toned and softened.
Perhaps the heat and burden of a summer
panto, season is a healthful thing for the
art of the girl performers: they gain grace
as they lose flesh. Certainly it is when
Maggie Dickinson’s figure is slimmest that
her beautiful performance carries most
weight.

At Melbourne King’s the fine voice of
Fred Monument continues to proclaim him
“Turn to the Right,”
at Sydney Palace.
Gilly (Stapleton
Kent) speaks rever-
ently of Joe's
“mudder.”
The Elfin King—
which he certainly
isn’t. He’s the
Slave of the Lamp
that makes every-
body rich beyond
the dreams of ava-
rice, and enables
Aladdin to marry
Olive Godwin. All
song statements in
panto, must be
taken with a
packet of salts, so
to speak. The ap-
palling Wid o w
Bailey declares
that she’ll have
regimental' colors
on her camisole
when her Boy
comes home from
France, but nobody
supposes that any
boy in France has
been sufficiently
shell - shocked to
think of marrying
the alleged mother
of Aladdin. Be-
sides, she is en-
gaged to the Em-
peror. It is one of
the penalties of
being an emperor in panto, that the poten-
tate is invariably required to have matri-
monial designs on a nightmare in Dame’s
clothing.

The tale of The Bird of Paradise con-
tinues to wag at Melbourne Royal, and Hula
Hula is still the cry. Every night, on the
right side of 11 p.m., the sacred mountain
gets its steam up and Muriel Starr is under-
stood to plunge into the crater. After which
a plump pagan (James Hughes) peers into
the scenic perturbation, like one who has
lost his hat. in order to persuade the audi-
ence that Muriel has made away with her-
self. The audience, being hardly convinced
on the. point, reckons that if Hughes really
wanted to win the war he would jump into
the noisy volcano himself. His conduct in
refraining from sacrificial suicide seems most
ungentlemanly urd" 1 ’ the circumstances.

g.unnasts, Delmore and
Lee ; neither is Rogero
cheapened by the fact
that his recent imita-
tions of a flute and a
concertina are not
comparable with his
cornet and banjo
efforts. Belle Sylvia,
the Lady Baritone, is
another capital vaude-
ville turn. The tall
and stately Belle isn’t
any more of a baritone
than many anothor
deep contralto before
her, but she knows
exactly what to do
with a large voice and
personality, and how
to do it. Later arrivals
range from, good to
passable. The two
Grahams are tuneful
exponents of the
human marionette
business, a human
marionette being a
person whose face
sings, moves and has
its being in conjunc-
tion with a toy body
on a tiny stage. Also
they provide a rousing
ciap-trap finish to their act. The Four
Crowns are a quartet of kiddie girl
acrobats with contortionist tendencies.
The pianist and tenor —Cahill and Brooke—
are a higher-class concert turn than
the Kismet Trio, including a smiling lady
harpist. Murphy and Lockmar are
much the same as half a dozen pre-
vious couples from America whose artistic
equipment is more limited than their
assurance. Their comedy consists mainly
of the male partner passing remarks
on the lady’s plumpness, and inviting her to
ask questions which will pave the way for
further reflections on her figure, though it
isn’t a shape to excite special attention in a
tram-car. Also they both go through the
form of being convulsed with spontaneous
merriment which they would fain hide from
the audience, and this is surely the thin-
nest make of comedy on the market. But
their good humor is not altogether unin-
fectious.

The leading lady at Hoyt's (Melbourne)
this week is beauteous Pauline Frederick,
whose speaking likeness dominates the
silent drama of “Double Crossed.” Pauline
on the film has the same fault as the ordi-
nary melodrama heroine on the stage. She
circumvents the villain in a terribly round-
about way, at awful risk to her sweet self,
whereas a few well-chosen remarks to an
influential capitalist would have saved her-
self and her husband all the anxiety. In
which case no drama to speak of would have
been available for the film. The picture-
story at Hoyt’s is full of interest, and
Pauline’s manner of disposing of the boss
grafter who means no good is a fine piece of
acting. The other principal picture shows
Wallace Reid in a pugilistic capacity. Reid
is an almost incredibly picturesque hero
when he is making love or proving his
innocence, and when he puts up his hands
to fight he is first-cousin to the god of stousli.

Dick Rosson, a new movie celebrity, is
finishing a busy week at Melbourne Majestic.
He is the hero the camera loves to linger
upon in the brisk Triangle story of Cassidy.
Cassidy is the “super” in the Order of
Supercrooks, but in gratitude one evening
he allows himself to be kind to a very nice
girl. The intelligent film-fancier can guess
the rest—can visualise a high-colored
Cassidy playing corner-man in the Band of
Hope. The features of Frederick Ward are
lit up in the second Majestic feature, “The
Heart of Ezra Greer.” Frederick appears
as Ezra, a trembling patriarch who uses up
a mile of film in a hunt for a vanished
daughter.
** * *
Pictures in Adelaide are rather interest-
ing. Wondergraph puts up Jack Pickford in
a school story and shows a remarkable
in Transit” infant actor. West’s has Bern-
hardt, simple and effective, in the painful
“Mothers of Prance” ; also “Onesliot Boss,”
the renowned virtuous killer, who yet, for
the sake of a thrilling climax, is disarmed
with absurd ease by a Bad Man, and even
allows an unarmed one to leap on lnm and
put up a good scrap. The Royal is showing
how the Fox films, which are a bit too fond
of the seamy side of life, can be uproariously
funny when they let loose; the Town Pul
jumped in with a week of “The Eternal
City”; and the Pav. features O. Henry’s
br'sk stories. Thomas’s Pierrots get the
advantage of the warm evenings at the Exhi-
bition Garden ; they sing delightfully, but —
be 1 ring Sydney Hollister —are weakest when
they sta t to be comic. The Austral Garden
has lost the Jesters, and taken on a small
but useful band of Merrymakers instead.
The Majestic has Ethel Vaughan, a short
play by Leslie Woods and his little co., and
the excellent Togo lot. At the Tivoli, a
pleasing novelty entitled “East Lynne”;
Lesley Adrienne as what America calls the
“sob sis.er,” and Fitzherbert (of course) as
the irresistible seductor.
The Byng adventure that premature halle-
lujahs were sung about must have been
pretty disastrous. Less than three months
ago it was claimed for the British armies in
France that they had lost only a few
thousand prisoners and no guns during the
year. Now it is announced that the British
losses on the Western Front were 27,000
prisoners and 166 guns for 1917. The
previous fine average of losses versus
gains must have been simply knocked
to pieces in the early-winter battle.
Byng! Ominous name. It was an Admiral
Byng who was court-martialled and shot in
1757 for having failed to attempt the recap-
ture of Minorca from the French. The
French cynics of the time said that the Eng-
lish shot Byng pour encourager les autres.
“K.”: Charles Gregory Wade having been
knighted, it is now time to tell the story of
how he tried to get away with the stained and
battered straw hat which I had christened in
self-defence “Old Sydney.” The then leader
of N.S.W. Opposition absent-mindedly took
the pathetic ruin from the rack of a
crowded restaurant and strolled towards the
pay-desk. Some of my friends raised the
alarm, and I rose and went after the pirate.
He returned it with a graceful apology and
came back with me to get his own lid—
which was just one shade worse than mine.
“I didn’t think the Liberal party had come
down to hat-stealing, Mr. Wade,” said I.
“Well.” laughed Gregory, “ collectively it
may, but individually it hasn’t.”
Old parson Jefferis, just dead in Adelaide,
used to say that he owed his degree of
LL.D. to some Sydney boys who stole his
apples. He chased the marauders and fell
and broke his leg; and when he found him-
self booked for some weeks on his back he
made up his mind that the time should not
be wasted, and started to read for the degree.
“Tea is 6s a 1b.,” says an Australian in
London, “and very scarce at that. The
oueue at one big tea place was fortified by a
few A.I.F. soldiers. When they gradually
edged in turn to the door of the promised
land, the man inside looked at them. “ You
don’t want tea, surely?” said he. “Good
Lord, no! We thought it was a picture-
show !” laughed Billjim.
When the Outburst happened in Europe
Esk Sandford, youngest son of thp ex-iron-
master, went off in khaki to Rabaul, and was
afterwards invalided and discharged. Inac-
tion didn’t suit the youngster, so he made off
to Blighty, and in no time was piloting a
’plane in the Naval Air Service. Next, he
was given the ticklish job of tester, and
finally was transferred to the Royal Flying
Corps, where he soon become a flight-com-
mander. Last mail announced that the Syd-
ney boy had achieved the rank of squadron-
commander, which leaves him little further
to go. .
Father Clune, a bearded stalwart who is
two years the right side of 50, has just won
the M.C. in recognition of his having
marched in six giants of the Prussian Guard
amid a Billjim cheer that split the sky.
He is with a Cornstalk battalion, and his
habit is to haunt the front trenches under
pretence of carrying important letters. It
was on one of these excursions that he col-
lected the Fritzes. He’s from County Clare,
and as Passionist missionary is known in
every State, for he has been 25 years in
Australia. He was the first R.C. padre to
enter Liverpool camp, and the last to leave
Gallipoli; he has been wounded and men-
tioned in despatches; and his brother is
Archbishop of Perth.

“Peter’’: Those good friends, Billjim and
Sandy, were at an estaminet chaffing one
another as usual. Sandy belonged to a
famous Scottish regiment that has the proud
record of ntrver having lost a trench to the
Huns. “I hear the Fritzes got into your
trench last night, Sandy,” said Bill. “Ye’re
a liar.” said Sandy. “Yes, they got in,” con-
tinued the Australian, “an’ you never saw
’em cornin’.” Anticipating an offensive he
moved out of range and then chuckled:
“They jus’ walked in disguised as a joke!”
* * * *
“Karee” : The decoction which the highly-
imaginative Gippo calls whisky was abso-
lutely taboo within the sacred precincts of
No. 1 A.G.H. Every trick was tried, but
defeated, after a more or less prolonged run.
Things were looking serious for the great
Australian thirst, when Billjim developed a
sudden fondness for the zepp-shaped yellow
melon, yclept bassoos, which showed inebri-
ating qualities hitherto unsuspected. A
rougly-handled drunk dropped his melon one
night, whereupon the sagacious vegetable
gave birth to a full-grown bottle of the best
procurable. Melons being rigidly censored
henceforth, Billjim suddenly waxed senti-
narental, and for a while successfully passed
the guard with a bouquet intended for the
ward sister, but chastely sheltering a hair of
the perennial dog. I can’t say what took
the place of that poetic dodge, as I resumed
chasing Jacko after its ignominious exposure.
Chaplain Stacey Waddy, once headmaster
of King’s School, Parramatta, is having his
grins, too. One night the battalion he was
with was returning from the trenches and
had to pass through a sea of -mud. Shells
were falling all around, so the chaps were
being pushed on. Stumbling along one
unlucky beggar got bogged up to the waist
and could not be got out. Finally his mates
told him they could do nothing more—he
would have to stay. The padre was
near, and the poor beggar in his agony at
the thought of being blown to bits or
drowned in the mud, burst out: “Damn it
all, Padre, you might try a prayer;
that’s what you’re here for!” (P.S. —They
came back after dark and extracted him with
a mule.)
'***■*
Mostly concerning revolutions:—
There are many things that the community would
like to know about the present whirly condition of
Russia. To begin with, it wants to know the correct
spelling and pronunciation of “Bolshevik,” and the
reason why a Bolshevik is one. Also, who and when
and where was the first Bolshevik, and are there
honorary and stipendiary Bolsheviks, and appren-
tice Bolsheviks who study the business at a techni-
cal college? Does the whole affair consist of a few
leaders Who get very little chance to lead and a vast
indefinite mass of followers who include everybody
that wears a wild expression in the eye and untidy
hair? It is commonly understood that a man may
be a Bolshevik to-day and anything else to-morrow
or yesterday, and, to put it shortly, that anybody
is or isn’t a Bolshevik who looks like one or
otherwise.
The learned and dreamy leaders of the movement
saw that things were wrong, and yearned to put them
right. The extreme and ill-regulated tail which had
broken out of gaol before the completion of its sen-
tence saw that things were wrong and hoped to make
them worse by profane language and burglary. This
happens in all revolutions. The great essential is
that the head of the movement may be strong enough
to hang or guillotine the tail in the interests of
AN EFFORT OF DISREMEMBERING.
THE "BOY”: “You know, when I get into these clothes it’s hard for me to remember that
I’m twenty-two.”
THE OTHER: “Yes, it must be hard to forget the other ten.”
order. A revolution wants order even more urgently
than a despotism.
The old rulers of Russia were a hard lot, a bad lot
and a not. very capable lot. Yet in their time the
country held together in a sort of way, and people
walked on the right side of the pavement where
there was one, and three square meals’ a day were
not uncommon. Now there is famine with the best
intentions, and people walk on any side of the pave-
ment.
Revolution is a fine art when applied to an
ignorant folk who have had little chance to learn
self-government. The men who upset the Bourbons
in Prance were artists after a fashion. They beheaded
all the petty tyrants who didn’t get away in time
and confiscated their ill-gotten wealth. At the same
time they made the revolution keep step. They said
that one revolution at a time was enough. Every-
body had to revolushe at fixed hours.
An old, mouldy, brutish autocracy is an incurable
animal, and requires to be utterly wiped out as soon
as the right men are found for the job. On the
other hand a young revolution is apt to be frisky
and fll-regulated. It requires careful steering.
Many a promising revolution has broken a heap of
valuable property, and finally its own neck, because
the honest but uncertificated mariners in charge
didn’t know ar.y better. Then it was “buried with
the burial of an ass,” like Jehoiakim, King of Judah.

“Petifi”: I met the Sentimental Bloke’s
cousin in a little N. S. Wales mining town-
ship lately. He was clobbered obviously in
his Sunday tailorings, his hard-bitten face
shone with soap, and when he entered
the bar he tenderly placed a small
blue coffin he had been carrying under
his arm on the end of the counter and
softly ordered a beer. The other
gentlemen present watched him imbibe
in respectful silence. Then the bar-
lady voiced the genera l sympathy.
“So, Geoi’ge, you have lost your little
one.’’ “Yes, missus,” replied George,
dejectedly, “the poor little ’s snuffed
out!”
* * * *
“0.K.” : Yes, England is revoluting. (You
can find the heading “The English Revolu-
tion’’ in dozens of Yankee papers.) In
Lancashire a medical man was summoned
for assault. A 10-year-old boy was taking
a short cut home, when the doctor, who
rented the paddock, carried him into the
house to give him a hiding for his trespasses.
The boy screamed for mercy and attracted
a motor-driver to his aid; and when the
intruder ventured to expostulate the doctor
gave him a bit of the whip, too. And
what happened to this landholder in good
old Tory England? We know what usually
doesn’t happen to a medical man who com-
mits a breach of the law in democratic
Australia. In fact, the wind of retribution
is tempered to any professional man of
means. But in Newest England! Well,
the doctor was sent to gaol for six weeks,
with hard labor. One of the “push” might
knock you down and jump on you in Aus-
tralia for less than that,

And, carefully smoothing his parted hair, he reached
for his outsize hat
And galloped out of that restful place, in the manner
of one who must
Be up and doing to Save the Throne from Crumbling
into Dust.
DEEDS OF VALOR.—NO. 1: CUTTING
THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION.
“What did the Colonel say when you asked
for Mabel's hand?”
“Swore dreadfully at me, and threatened to
horsewhip me.”
“Good gracious! And what did you do?”
“By Gad, y’know, that's more than a man
can stand, so I — er—rang off in his
bally ear.”
And then a clatter and hum arose in the halls of the
Truly Great,
And the Wheels of Fate went whirling round at a
simply amazing rate,
With the patter of nervous feet that rang down
corridors cool and grey,
As jabbering citizens came and went in quite an
excited way,
With the root-toot-toot of a swarm of cars that
bustled from here to yon,
While high, pink foreheads unused to stress with
perspiration shone.
Both far and near strange noises woke —the drum-
ming of angry drones,
The cackle of heated speech and “Blazes!” muttered
in undertones ;
The solemn cackle of earnest folk that waited around
in knots;
The distant snarls of the Tiger, vexed with his own
confounded spots ;
The painful snorting of messengers, arriving with
bags of mail,
And the sudden yelping of some stray Rover, cursed
with a tardy tail.
The creaking of crammed wastebaskets, filled with
the wreckage of busted plans;
The jangle of frantic ’phones, the rumbling roar of
electric-fans ;
The hurried swing of his Ex.’s door and a grumble
of “Well, what now?”
As the press poked in, persistently, with a hand to
its baking brow.
Grizzle and yammer and peck and push, squabble
and whine and biff—
The sort of racket one might expect at the birth of
a hippogriff!
Placidly prim, the Great One sat once more in his
easy-chair,
Doing his dutiful best with the terrible burden he
had to bear;
And, all the time, as he sucked a straw, with a
drink on the end of it,
From beautiful plot to fragrant plan he let his
fancies flit;
And all the time, as thus he helped the Empire to
endure,
He rested both his poor eld feet on the office
furniture.

HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS
THE RELIABLE HOME REMEDY FOR
Headaches, Neuralgia, Insomnia, Brain Fag, Anaemia
and other Neurasthenic Conditions.
Mr. A. D. Griffiths, Grazier, of Leamia, Curlewis, writing on November 8, 1917, said: “I have
been using HEAN’S TONIC NERVE NUTS regularly since I obtained the first supply a couple of
months ago, and I must say the result has been satisfactory to me, for they have undoubtedly
improved the state of my nerves, and, what is more, since using them I have put on over two
stone weight, having increased from 12st. 31b. to list. 71b. I may mention that my height is
6ft. and age 55 years. This information is given as an instance of the constitution-building
properties of your preparation. Mrs. Griffiths has also received benefit from the use of HEAN’S
TONIC NERVE NUTS.”
Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts

Things have become rather strenuous for
those volunteer helpers who are trying to
keep Bilijim’s unfortunate or incapable wife
fed, clothed, sheltered, amused and out of
debt during hubby’s absence. Owing to the
extravagant conduct, here and there, of Bili-
jim’s grass widow, it is now a solemn fact
that a decent, way-paying soldier’s-wife often
finds that she is given cold pig when she
goes house-hunting, or gets the glassy eye
when she desires the convenience of a fort-
nightly account with the butcher. Bangs,
J.P., of Prahran (Vic.), in giving a 30-days
ejectment-order (no rent was asked for)
against a woman who had allegedly let her
rent run unpaid since last August, "While
drawing her allowance without intermission,
put the case plainly enough :
If soldiers’ wives refuse to pay rent it will be
hard on those soldiers’ wives who desire to pay their
way, as agents will refuse to let them houses.
It will be hard —and it is ; and the agents
will—and they do. Australia's soldier-wife
wants putting on a strict business basis for
the good of all parties ; and a step in that
direction would be the raising of the 44d.
children’s allowance to something adequate,
so as to remove the last reasonable excuse of
the slie-loafer.
“F.N.T.”: Premier Bowser is having his
duty pointed out to him by the Moving
Finger, which has written “D” opposite
rather more than the usual number of in-
fants’ names this summer in Melbourne. A
recent discussion scared up some facts about
the city’s chief milk-charity, the Talbot In-
stitute. It appears that (1) Talbot milk
co,sts lOd. a quart to customers; (2) it is
only supplied free, in
approved cases, during
the summer; (3) it
isn’t delivered free,
even in the most
necessitous cases, un-
less the Government is
in a kindly mood and
provides enough cash
to pay for a free sup-
ply; (4) the Govern-
ment isn’t always in a
kindly mood, and
hasn’t been so gener-
ous this summer as ic
should have been.
None of these facts,
however, are to the
discredit of the Talbot
concern. When things
are good the Institute
gives frep milk and
lends ice-chests to poor mothers,
and shows them how to manage
the supply properly ; but as it has
only a limited income, its posi-
tion is generally painful. Bowser
ought to do two things: (1)
Spring after the frequent milk-
man who sells old, rotten or
skimmed milk ; (2) see that Little
Jim gets at least the bare neces-
sities of life, whether mummer
can afford to pay for them at
lOd. a quart or not. Incidentally,
it is time the Commonwealth re-
considered the £5 baby bonus.
Inquiry in a hundred directions
shows that it rarely does what it
was supposed to do. It was to
be a “maternity allowance” —
something to make matters more
comfortable for mother and safer
for little Jim. It really is a
baby bonus, mostly. The money
could be better spent in baby’s
interest in a dozen ways—the maintenance
of a pure-milk supply throughout summer is
one of them. And baby’s interest comes
first.
THE “PITCHER” THAT GOES TOO OFTEN TO THE WELL.
“Hullo, matie, doctor given you a nasty surprise?”
“Yes, the blighter’s always turned me down before; now lie’s passed me in.”
From the local society gossip :
A unique wedding took place at North Heeiriskirk,
in this tangled wilderness of West Tasmania, last
week, when our best pick-and-shovel woman, who
is also a tin-miner, was married to a member of
the same profession. The parson had to take a
day’s journey to reach his job, which was performed
in a disused hut. In lieu of a white satin cushion
the bride knelt on an overcoat, and all the scratchers,
fcssickers and tin miners for miles around stood by
in their shirt sleeves encouraging the pair.
Well, good-luck. Bill!
DISQUALIFIED.
“What! Are you tired already?"
“No; but your hands are so cold they give
me lumbago.”
The case of the damsel with a shocking
story which collapses under cross-examina-
tion has taken quite a new form in Adelaide.
She was 70, and the accused was 24! Two
charges were dismissed or withdrawn, on
account of the time lost—over two months—
in bringing them. There remained a similar
charge only 10 days old; but in this case
the old lady’s memory and self-possession
went all to pieces in the witness-box, and so
did the charge.
“Midget”: I’ve a wholesome dread of Ger-
man espionage. The —th Battalion, which
had been in France only a few hours, got
its first taste of trench life by relieving some
Maorilanders. A dark night was selected
for the change, and the handing-over took
place about 11 o’clock, the greatest secrecy
being observed. Next morning the new Bill-
jims were astounded at their welcome—a
board was reared above Fritz’s trench, show-
ing the colors of the new battalion!

The city sniggers at Wirewhiskers when
he comes down to the Show, with or without
the missus and the girls, and gets a lot of
fun out of their weird millinery; and it
never thinks that the Wirewhiskers family is
forming its own opinions, too. Wherefore
what “Bullant” Mclntyre, of the Southern
Cross (W.A.) Times, had to say when he
got back home from Melbourne is calculated
to do as good :
The “Block” is the strutting-ground on which may
be seen the arrogance of wealth, the ostentation of
brail.less females, and the price of unsexed females
who are as strange to virtue as they are to the touch
of an infant. Upon their bosoms may be seen pearls,
but never babies; in their hearts may be seen
vanity, but never love of motherhood that makes a
nation great.
I never walked the beastly “Block” without pray-
ing to Gcd to spare me the humiliation of meeting
“rnv ain” folk there, or those whom I was acquainted
with ; for that is the detestable abode of vanity, vice
and villainy.
What a contrast to the wholly-abominable “Block”
is to be seen in the Botanical Gardens. Here the
true mothers of a nation are to be seen ; not rigged
fore ar.d aft with birds’ tails, or other tails that
spell the price of the wearer, but robed like natural
mothers or maidenly lovers.
In the Gardens man has given his labor and artists
have given their art, in order that Nature, already
beautiful, may be so embellished that young humanity
may be nursed into manhood and womanhood there,
away from and untainted by greed or vanity, away
from the shameless female pariahs who strut and
pose on the “Block,” in robes that are as out-
rageous as they are indecent.
The Botanical Gardens are unspeakably glorious,
and when the mothers who know how to dress add
the beauty of their presence and the splendor of
their homely attires to scenes already made noble
bv the Creator and the combined brains and hands
of his fellows, there is hope for our race and a
future for our great Commonwealth.
“Boyd Cable”: I could close my eyes and
fancy myself back in Australia —if it weren’t
for the cold everywhere except where my
shins toast at the big fat stove. I’m sitting
in the mess of an Australian Flying Squad-
ron, and I hear snatches of Australian slaug
and a dropping fire of references to Condobo-
lin and ’Coota and Iviama and Coogee. The
papers in sight are the old Bully, the Mail,
Australasian, Herald and Sunday Sun.
The news is mighty stale because, although
this is November, the papers are only dated
xYugust (a mail has just arrived). These
papers are full of the Sydney strike, and the
mess is very full of curses. This afternoon
the squadron played a football match (Aus-
tralian game)with an A.I.F. battalion. Some
of them were in to tea, and again the talk
was boiling. I wish some of the strikers
could hear a few, even an expurgated few, of
.£he remarks of their scrapping men about
strikers and strikes at a time like
this. The iniquity of holding up ship-
ping while people in the Old Country
were going mighty short on food and
Australia is bulging with stores of grain
hung up for want of transport brought blis-
tering remarks. But what rankled most of
all was the claim of an occasional strike boss
that they were “protecting the rights” of the
men here! Over that magnificent bit of
hypocrisy the Australian adjective was
nearly worn out in indignant expletives.

From an Australian in Chelsea: —
George Reid is never seen in London now, and
rarely heard of even by Australians. The fact is he
has gone out of fashidii. This is not because of any
psychological discrepancy ; it is due purely to physi-
cal phenomena. You out there can hardly conceive
the antipathy against fat men that has taken hold of
us. We do not give loud expression to our hatred
of men of conspicuous girth, but the feeling is in-
stinctive, silent and morose, and however unjust is
based upon an almost universal emotion. Big eaters
are held despicable, and the crowd does not stop to
consider that the eater who is big is not necessarily
a big eater. Stomachs have “gone out” in London,
and for that reason public men are doing their
utmost to draw them in. Every day some personage
makes joyful announcement through the papers of
his loss of a further five pounds, or five ounces, as the
case may be. George Reid at large is a spectacle to
provoke anguish and bitterness in people with small
stomachs and little in them. So, in the interests of
public order, he remains perdu, possibly in compli-
ance with a polite request from the Lord High
Comptroller of Grub.
It comes in all sorts of ways. When
Henry Allen was climbing into a lorry at
Home Rule (N.S.W.) the other day, he
noticed that the family cat was having a
doze between the horses’ legs. Allen threw
a handful of sand at the cat to scare it out
of danger. Puss was scared all right, and
fled to safety; but the horses took fright
also, and in the ensuing bolt Allen was flung
from the lorry and killed.
THE SACRIFICES OF OUR WOMEN.
THE CURATE : “Don’t you often wish your
husband hade from the war?”
THE FLOCK: “Oh, no! I’m no kill-joy. He

“A.M.C.”: A signpost outside a dug-out
near Passchendaele points downwards under
an inscription: “12,000 miles to Griffiths
Bros.” A brother wag has printed under-
neath that: “Also to Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.” Truly Billjim is as blithe as a
French poilu, and that says everything on
the subject.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The hilltop street lamp, suddenly in jest
Flicks out the pale flame of the climbing moon,
And Twilight, dropping from a cloud balloon,
Sets off as postman with a bag of rest.
And I'm on the ferry where neighborly fun
Is sign that the day’s drab flurry is done.
The hill-dames round the harbor sit and smile,
Green gfannyhoods with earth-glee quivering;
They gossip slyly on the one droll thing—
That men must leave their ledgers for a while.
And both ferry funnels leave fat plumes of smoke,
To show they have fathomed the hills’ fine joke.
The fond bay stretches out his warm brown arms
And from them slips that ready flirt, the pier.
Coquettishly, as we draw slowly near,
She stirs to make parade of all-her charms.
And home thoughts like stars dance in everyone’s face
As steamer and pier hug in shameless embrace.
Soon all the hill's awink with window eyes,
Warm eyes that watch beside the waiting doors,
That hide joy-brimmed, ecstatic pinafores.
And so I’m singing, swinging up the rise 1
I’ll soon have one knuckle delightfully in
The tiny cleft curve of my baby’s chin.
MAORIIAND.

Dear Bulletin,— l noticed a presenta-
tion of my classic lineaments in a recent
number. But you’ve manufactured a genea-
logy for me. The Portuguese are an excel-
lent _ people in many ways, and I have
received much kindness from them in
several countries; but I am not anxious to
trace my parentage to their race. My
father—not my stepfather—was a Chinese.
Hence my name. My mother is an Irish-
woman. All of which is good enough for
me. As for the rest, “I am my own ances-
tor.” —Yours, Thomas J. Iv. Bakhap.
There are still several persons living who
came to S. A us. with Gov. Hindmarsh in
his ship Buffalo in 1836, and one of them,
Mrs. McMann, actually attended at Glenelg
on “the twenty-eighth” and signed the year’s
roll. As for “pioneers”—any born or arriv-
ing not later than 1840 get a special wel-
come at the annual demonstration —nearly
a hundred are still active enough to attend.
The first Melbourne jeweller to make

LAWYER MAXWELL, M.H.R..
Kaiser Wilhelm acknowledges Martin
Luther to be one of his great exemplars. We
might have guessed it. Martin Luther is
known as “The monk that shook the world.”
Marie Corelli has been fined £7O for
hoarding food. Tripe, no doubt.
In a large-family competition restricted
to Australian knights white-whiskered old
John Mark Davies, whom Tom Bent wanted
to make a Supreme Court judge, would be
an easy winner. He can count up well
over a dozen.
Major H. W. 11. Seager, just returned
aft r service in Eg.vnt. Gallipoli, France and
Flanders, br’ngs a Military Cross with him.
He enlisted with his two brothers in 1914,
and won his decoration foi the dash with
which he led a rescue company against the
Hun. His gran’clad, Lieut.-General Seager,
C. 8.. took Tvnri as a lieutenant in the charge
of the Light Brigade.
The tragedy of war came 12,000 miles
closer the other day when Brisbane took off
its hat to the passing of Major W. O.
Hodgkin son. A son of the explorer and poli-
tician after whom a river and a goldfield
were named, he carried three stars on his
shoulder-strap in S’Africa. He was in camp
a month after the Kaiser set the world on
fire, and left as second in command of the
11th L.II. For his work in Egypt he re-
ceived special mention. Afterwards he put
in over 12 months’ strenuous service in
France and gained his majority. Illness
invalided him to England, and in August
last he was brought home to the four little
Australians who had lost their mother while
their father was in the firing-line. But he
never recovered sufficiently to leave Kangaroo
Point Military Hospital.
Signaller Tom Skeyhill, blinded at Gal-
lipoli, is off to America on a lecturing tour.
Not only have his wanderings in Austral’a
brought him more than a decent living, but
he has raised over £15,000 for patriotic
funds—a remarkable achievement for a man
who, when he was led off the boat on his
return to Australia, had only one grief, that
he would be a burden to his friends. His
father, J. P. Skeyhill, acts as Signaller Tom’s
manager nowadays, and will go with him on
his big tour.
Hughes never touches an omelet these
days.
The Hun robbed Australia of a promising
musician when he closed the score of Private
George Hurst last month. Born 26 years
ago, Hurst had already made good among
Sydney and Melbourne musical folk before
he went to Germany to study in 1912. Just
before he sailed one of his compositions—an
orchestral intermezzo—was produced at a
Marshall Hall concert. At its conclusion
vociferous calls for the composer failed to
produce young Hurst (as a matter of fact,
he had fled) ; whereupon Marshall Hall
called: “We can’t find the composer, but we
will repeat his composition.” Which, com-
ing from Hall, was no small compliment.
Hurst escaped from the Hun when the storm
broke, reached England and enlisted with
the Royal Fusiliers.
Dead at 65, after a very short illness,
E. W. Van Senden. He was born of a
Dutch family in England, and made wool
the business of his life. From 1881 he was
a S. Australian, but soon became known
almost as well in Maoriland and anywhere
else where there was wool to be bought or
sold. At the end of the century Dalgety’s
took over his business, and he became their
Adelaide manager. Public life did not
attract him, but he did good work for the
School of Mines and Chamber of Commerce.
Personally, he was the most genial and
kindly of men. Both of his grown-up sons
are in France.
The Australian record for number of
times enlisted probably belongs to James
Marquis Cairns, 25, who first joined the
colors on August 24, 1914, and was with
S. Australia’s famous Tenth on the Penin-
sula. Shot through chest and arm, he came
home, recovered, and joined the 50th, the
Tenth’s younger brother, resuming business
Egypt on March 21, ’l6. Wounded at
Fleurbaix, France, he was discharged in
Australia 10 months later. Just- a rear
after that (9/1/T.B) he was sworn in at
Melbourne for his third round. In peace-
time he is one of the messengers at Parlia-
ment House.
Concerning two inventors: —
Two useful Australians are Lieut. W. 11. Geake
and Alfred Salenger, who lately got the Order of
the British Empire “for courage and self-sacrifice in
volunteering to carry out dangerous experiments in
making munitions.” Geake (37) formerly hung out
his consulting-engineer’s shingle in Sydney, and
Salenger (36) is a partner in a Sydney firm of whole-
sale jewellers. Early in his career as a Billjint
Geake struck an idea for an improved bomb, and
Salenger helped him to perfect it. About a year
ago the Defence Department got an unusual hustle
on, and sent the twq inventors to England to submit
their ironmongery to the War Office. Soon after
their arrival a batch of the new missies were sent to
the trenches and proved themselves first-chop. It
was while making further experiments for the War
Office that the cobbers earned the 0.8. E. During
an explosion Geake rushed into a room, rescued one
of his men and dashed back again, thinking there
was another man there. Seemingly there wasn’t,
and the mistake cost Geake a broken leg, a right
hand, and divers other things. Details of Salenger’s
trouble are not yet available, but his little personal
lot of damages includes a fingerless left hand and a
badly-damaged left arm. Both men are now out of
hospital.
Bananaland lost one of its oldest inhabi-
tants when John Warren White passed out
at the age of 91. He came from County
Clare, Ireland, and had withstood 60 years
of the Northern climate. Major-General
C. B. White (trebly decorated) and Colonel
D. P. White are sons and are still on the Big
Job. His only three grandsons are at the
same address.
With a John L. Sullivan jaw and a voice
like the bull of Bashan’s, the Rev. Herbert
E Hobdaj- has been making more stir in
the Speck than the referendum and apple-
crop troubles combined. He is going to
reform everything from drunkards down to
politicians—from pubs to Parliament. Until
he “does his block” with enthusiasm he is a
finished elocutionist; then he roars and per-
forms acrobatic
feats that any
movie - producer
would pay him big
money for. His
only debauchery is
bowls.

Adelaide had word at Christmas of little
li. - i. 'lariton, who. after quitting tne Church
half a century ago, became a man of note in
S. Australia’s trade and politics. Nearly
smothered under a bank smash, - he went to
S’Africa, and, though he will be 90 in April,
he writes from there that he feels “like a
young cedar, fresh and green.”
Arthur H. Moseley, one of the latest
batch of D.S.O.’s, is an old boy of North
Sydney Grammar, and took his medical
degree at Sydney Uni. in 1909. He served
with the Australian A.M.C. in Gallipoli and
Egypt, and since June, 1916, has been lieut.-
colonel in charge of a field-ambulance in
France. Father is W. 11. Moseley, who for
many years pursued costs in partnership
with W. P. Manning in Sydney, arid before
that was a captain in the British Army.
H. GREGORY, M.H.R. (W.A.), one of the

Mazzini Tron, the Anglican chaplain from
the W.A. “Brotherhood of St. Boniface,” who
won the M.C. lately in Flanders, can wear
the D.S.O. as well now.
Now in Sydney, Ernest Darling, “The
Nature Man” of Tahiti, wearing a little
more than when Jack London introduced
him in “The Cruise of the Snark.” Sydney
in summer should be a good place to preach
the joy of throwing off clothes and madden-
ing the tailors ; but the nuts and cocoanut-
milk idea won’t catch on. Darling is a fine
figure of a man in an abbreviated khaki
suit, a fishing-net shirt, and no socks or hat.
He’s Amurrikan, of course.
“J.F.11.” looks backward through the fog:
Thirty-two years ago a quartette of Socialists,
John Burns, H. M. Hyndman, H. H. Champion and
John Williams, stood in the dock of the Old Bailey
charged with having seditiously raised a riot in
Trafalgar Square and the West End. They were
acquitted, but a few years later John Burns got
three months for creating a disturbance in the same
square. It proved a good advertisement. He
became an M.P. and Minister of the Crown with
£5OOO a year, which he threw up at the outset of
this war. Hyndman is still a Socialist leader, but
has repeatedly failed to get into Parliament. Cham-
pion has lived in Melbourne for many years and
treads other paths. Williams, the fourth of the
batch, has just died in London. He was one of the
founders of the Social Democratic Federation and
was sentenced to a month’s imprisonment in 1884 for
some illegal remarks at a meeting. At a more recent
date he got into trouble for making what the Lord
Chief Justice called “disgraceful suggestions against
a friendly Sovereign and relation of our own
beloved King.” That “friendly sovereign and rela-
tion of our own beloved King” was—Kaiser Bill.
Major Charlie Cunningham, who nas
been made secretary of the Vic. State \\'ar
Council, is a brother of Argus editor
Cunningham. As official shorthand-writer
at the Law Courts, he was frequently a tar-
get for amiable eulogy from C.-J. Madden
and other dignitaries. He enlisted in the
early days of 4*he war, got a commission and
finally was made a major and placed in
charge of the Australian military post office
in London.
By way of consoling old Frank Madden
for his kick-out from Parliament, the Vic.
Executive Council has appointed him a
trustee of the Public Library and National
Gallery, in place of Edward Carlile, de-
ceased. Frank Madden’s claim to anv sort
of connection with literature and art
amounts to nil. But his many displays of
arrogance and stupidity in public capacities
marked him as the sort of man whom
Executive Councils delight to honor in
ways like this. He was in the swim—
swimming in Fat, so to speak.

Feelin’ all content ’n’ pretty,
Where the smart procession goes,
Prinked ’n’ polished to the shows,
One among the happy drive—
’S worth the world to be alive!
Dames ez smilin’ ez a mother,
Ev’ry man yer fav’rit brother:
“ ’Elio, Jumbo, how is it?”
“Arr, there, soldier ! Good ’n’ fit ?”
Talcin’ hozone at St. Kilder’s good enough for me,
Seein’ Summer and the star-blink simmer in the sea;
Cantin’ rip me bloomin’ cady, toyin’ with a cig.,
Blowin’ out me pout a little, chattin’ wide ’n’ big
When there’s skirt around to slcite to —’
Say, ’oo‘has a better right to?
Done me bit ’n’ done it well,
Got the tag iv plate to tell;
Square Gallipoli surviver,
With a touch iv Colonel’s guyver—
“Sargin’ Jumbo, good ole son!”
“Soldier, soldier, you’re the one!”
Back agin, a wounded hero, moochin’ up ’n’ down,
Feelin’ ’sthough I’d got a fond arf-Nelson on the
town;
Never was so gay, so ’elp me, never felt so kind ;
Fresh from ’ell a paradise ain’t very ’ard to find.
After filth, ’n’ flies, ’n’ slaughter
Fat brown babies in the water,
Singin’ people on the sand
Makes a boshter Happy Land !
War what toughened bone ’n’ hide
Turned a feller soft inside !
Great it is, the ’earty. greetin’s,
Friendly digs, ’n’ cheerful meetin’s:
“’Elio, Jumbo, howia do?”
“Soldier, soldier, liow’re you?”

opportunity looms
larg'er than ever.
SH E announcement to-day of our Half-yearly Midsummer Sale
I which COMMENCES on MONDAY NEXT, January 21,
will loom larger than ever before in the minds of the far-sighted
men in the community who have clothing needs that need atten-
tion now, or who can anticipate their wants in days to come.
For two short weeks —the shortest Sale Time offer in our trading history—a
general and substantial price reduction will apply to all lines of Austral Apparel for
Men’s and Boys’ Wear, at both our headquarters and new branch stores.,
A definite saving of full ten per cent, represents a positive gain of at least 21- in the
£ to every man who makes a purchase during Sale Time, and this lowered price

SALE PRICE

The discount of ten per cent, determines the Sale Price of all
Austral Sac Suits to measure, as the list of prices given below will
show.
Special attraction, however, offers in the choice of fabric that may
be made at the usual price of Seventy Five Shillings, which, less the
discount, is priced during the period of the sale at Sixty Seven
and Six.
Xot only is the whole range of suitings of exceptional value, but
the variety of texture and pattern in both Australian- and English-
made Tweeds makes a remarkable showing indeed.
For the man whose expenditure on clothes must be kept at the
lowest point which will ensure him a dependable standard of quality
and an assured good appearance, this is an extraordinarily favor-
able opportunity. Come and see.

Actually £25,000 was reckoned by the mana-
ger to be required to meet depreciation in
the last year; but towards this there was
£3BOO standing unappropriated in the De-
preciation Fund. The total amount pro-
vided for depreciation since the mine started
is £155,954. This has been actual money
received on the sale of coal and most of
it. can be traced: —Works, etc. (presumably
replacements), £57.559; cash, £40,989;
Government stock, £34,061. The sink-
ing fund contributions as shown above
total £83,485, which is accounted for
this way : Repaid to State, £24,101; Govern-
ment stock, £52,274; in the business, £7050.
So we get this aggregate result. In seven
years the mine has repaid the State £24,161
of the £266,509 of capital put into it; it has
kept up the payment of interest on the loan
liability; and it has accumulated in cash and
Government securities £133,924 towards the
replacement of machinery and the return ot
capital. In addition it has provided out of
revenue over £50,000 worth of plant, etc.;
but probably all or most of this was to re-
place worn-out or discarded machinery.
As the depreciation and sinking funds have
accumulated, interest has of course assisted
the earnings. Of last year’s gross profit
£3184 came from the mine; interest revenue
was £2971. This only makes the slump in
the gross profit more serious. So far as the
past year is concerned the slump made it
impossible to put anything into the
sinking fund. However, the contribu-
tions thus far have been very liberal.
The manager, after careful boring, puts
the reserves at 17.000,000 tons, after
eliminating the areas containing thin
and banded coal. Last year’s output was
372.007 tons; in the previous 12 months
452.798 tons ; the year before that, 567,056
tons. At 500,000 tons a year the reserves
would last 34 years. As a matter of fact,
the present sinking fund, improved at 4
p.c., and without any further contributions
of principal, would amount to £225,000 in
34 years, and the debt now owing is only
£17,000 more than that. This paper isn’t,
however, suggesting that sinking fund con-
tributions should be knocked off. It will
not call for much of an effort to wipe the
debt out in 17 years. A contribution of
£5750 a year will do it.
If the Wontliaggi coal-miners had been
political agents in the employ of the Em-
ployers’ Federation or some other violently
anti-Labor body, they couldn’t have given
it better service. Their life, especially dur-
ing the past three or four years, has been
spent in throwing scorn on the Labor plat-
form and mocking at Labor aspirations.
Instead of demonstrating that industrial rest
could be secured by exchanging public for
private enterprise, these men proceeded to
show that State employment gives the pub-
lic ho greater security than private employ-
ment. On the question of earnings the
manager says:—
Net average earnings ot contract miners, alter
deducting cost of explosives and lights: —
1913- . . 13s. 11.49 d. per shift.
1914- .. 13s. 11.64 d.
1915- . . 14s. 6.16 d.
1916- . . 16s. 2.10 d.
There was a strike in November. 1910. in
sympathy with one in N. 8. Wales. The
War Precautions Coal Board heavily bribed
the men to go back and give their promise to
stay in for three years. That opened their
eyes. Having tasted the fruits of blackmail,
and found out how easy it was, they put the
screw on again, and went out once more in
August and September last year, without,
as they confessed, having any local griev-
ance.
One of the grievances of those who have
wanted to see public enterprise given a
chance was that the Leg. Council hamstrung
this undertaking by refusing to it the right to
sell coal to the public. All the screened coal
went to the railways and other public depart-
ments; only the slack could be offered to the
people, the owners of the mine. However —
The Government recently provided for the sale to
the public of the coal obtained from the thin seams
which could not be economically worked at the price
obtained from the Kailway Department for screened-
coal, the alternative being the abandonment of these
seams. Shortly after this decision to sell coal from
these seams to the public was arrived at, the War
Precautions Coal Board gave an unexpected addi-
tional payment to the miners working these low-
banded seams, although the men were previously
making good wages ; and as this decision will increase
costs, there is little possibility of making this coal
pay.

Freight troubles are the chief worry of this
Melbourne co.. which carves forests in
Maoriland and. more recently. Westrnlia.
But scarcity of shipping has so curtailed
importation that the foreign stick is almost
unobtainable; wherefore, despite the hole
that lias been knocked in the building trade,
the co. shows no war-scars worth mention-
ing. Of course, like every other trader who
is opening liis mouth very wide, it talks
about the inconveniences it has to put up
with and the business it has to miss; but
when you remember that the bottom was
due to fall out of the borrowing and con-
struction boom in any case, there isn't any
need to condole with the co. Gross profits
at £92,425 for last year are only £l2OO
below those of live years ago, when the
boomsters were feeling very fit. Expenses,
certainly, have soared: management exes,
and taxes now take a cut of £43,130 (in-
cluding £4286 which the co. is allowing its
employees on active service) instead of
£24,906 in 1912.
The kauri forests of M.L. are gradually
disappearing, so in 1914 the co. began mill-
ing on a property it had acquired in West-
ralia. Here are the consequent balance-
sheet movements: —
1911. 1914. 1916. 1917.

Liquid assets. . 162,997 110,938 75,039 95,238
Precisely what is the value of its properties
the co. does not know, as both freeholds and
leaseholds include “standing timber there-
on,” an asset which varies according to
the state of the market. It is almost certain,
though, that the scarce kauri will get dearer
and dearer, and at the same time
Australian woods will come more into
favor; so this eo.’s forests should
depreciate but slowly. At one time
the co. reckoned its kauri areas were depre-
ciating pretty rapidly, and wrote down their
book value year by year as the getters put
the axe in. But a revaluation disclosed the
fact that its remaining forest giants were
enhanced beyond the value of the original
properties. Going back to the balance-sheet
figures, it will be seen that the co. has re-
duced its liabilities by £101.707 in three
years; meantime, however, the co.’s holding
of assets other than forest properties lias
decreased by £105,350. On the other hand,
apparently about £57,700 has been put into
plant and machinery. The formidable-look-
ing reserves of £187.512 are made up in
this way: Fire insurance fund. £50.000;
marine insurance. £18.562; dividend equali-
sation reserve, £34,993: log reserve. £9912 ;
and contingency fund, £74,045.

The £5703 includes £697 interest earned by
insurance and reserve fund invested outside
the business; so the net profit from trading
only just managed to scramble past £5OOO.
Allen Taylor’s have given special attention
to big sticks and heavy construction
material: and with the collapse of the
States’ borrowing boom one of the principal
sources of profit in that trade has run
pretty dry. Further, there is no shipping
available for the export trade in hardwoods,
in which there has also been good money in
normal times. However, the directors are
no doubt reckoning upon a brisk demand for
hardwood timber when Europe starts to
repair itself, and that and the steadily im-
proving local demand for liardwood to re-
place soft stuff in building has set the co.
to work increasing its equipment on the
N.S.W. North Coast. The result is shown
in this comparison :

In addition to the cash, etc., mentioned in
this table the co. has £29,379 of fixed de-
posits, War Loan and other reserve fund
investments; so its financial position is still
easy, notwithstanding the outlay on country
mills and the increase of hardwood stocks.
It is quite likely that the immediate future
won’t be much better than the immediate
past; but further ahead there will probably
be good profits — assuming, of course, that
the co. continues to command a manage-
ment that knows its way about.

This co., which lias swept the remnants of
half a dozen other building societies into
its basket, has been going slow during the
past two or three years, not knowing what
is ahead. Therefore if the profits are not
what they were shareholders can get this
consolation; (1) there is still a wide
margin of profit heyond the 8 p.c.
dividend, and (2) the risks have been
reduced —on paper, at any rate. The fol-
lowing table sets out the principal balance-
sheet figures as at various dates, going back
to 1900, when the co. had just purchased
the bones of the Planet Society:—
1900. 1915. 1916. 1917.

Cash, etc. . . 2,479 465 . 9,713 12,367
The second line among the advances sug-
gests the definite turn of the tide: after a
gradual reduction in the book value of the
foreclosed properties year after year, there
is a sudden increase to £15,426. Still,
unless something catastrophic happens, there
shouldn’t be very large losses. In spite of
the moratorium —a measure for which there
was very little justification, and which
ought to be overhauled at once —the mort-
gagee, and especially the mortgagee who has
made advances on building-society terms,
has suffered and is likely to suffer less from
the war than most people would have
believed possible. Most great wars have
been accompanied at home by horrible dis-
tress among the wage-earners, and especially
among the families of the fighting men. This
time credit has been so largely employed
that the wage-earner in Britain and Aus-
tralia has, on the whole, had more money
in his pocket than ever he had before ; and
if the building society hasn’t taken advan-
tage of that to get itself snug, then it
doesn’t know enough to take an umbrella
ivhen it looks like rain. How this society
will get on even with the umbrella nobody
knows, because nobody can be sure what the
storm will be like. If the markets for our
staple products fall to pieces, we are going
to suffer from a depression that will make
most of us take up a few holes in our belts.
And even if the markets keep pretty good
there is going to be such a bill to pay that
we shall feel very sick;, and the concern
with property to sell will have to wait for
a buyer. This co. has, however, so sub-
stantial a reserve, and its management exes,
are so very moderate, that it has a good
chance of maintaining a decent dividend.

This, is one of the unpretentious little up-
country mills whose object is to help the
farmer save a bit more from the middleman.
There’s not much in it, though, as that
bumpy profits column shows. In 10 years,
after paying a dividend averaging 5 p.c. p.a.
and maintaining its plant, etc., the co. has
actually reduced its net liquid and semi-
liquid assets from £BOOl to £OOl5. Never-
theless, it would be doing serviceable work
even if it only helped to keep the “offal” in
the country, where it is most wanted.
Capital is £11,389; liabilities, £OBl5. On
the other side: property and plant, £10,006;
stock, £5790; book debts, £5936; and sun-
dries, £1159.

The Bulletin will not swear that all the
£134,071 was made in the past year. As to
£50,000 the directors explain that “during the
year certain lands which have been in the
possession of the co. for many years and
gradually improved, till they were suitable
for closer settlement have been sold for that
purpose, and the capital surplus realised
enabled the directors to restore £50,000 to the
General Reserve.” This is an interesting
comment on the fears which once filled the
co. that the Labor party’s Federal land tax
would mean blue ruin. So terrified were the
directors that they launched out in S.
America, to find, of course, that the distant
field isn’t so green as it looked. As a matter
of fact, the Australian tax hasn’t visibly
reduced the value of land in small farms, for
the simple reason that those farms are
not taxable. Hence the fine profits which
sales have shown, as reflected in the first
column in the table. This co. has, indeed,
benefited in two ways. While big prices
have been got for land suitable (or alleged to
be suitable) for close settlement, the vendors
have pushed further out, and this and the
high prices of stock and wool have put up
the values of grazing country in the dry
areas in which also this co. was very largely
interested. There isn’t a doubt that in addi-
tion to the profits disclosed the co. has
thereby made a good deal of money which has
been applied to internal reserves—-probably
to write down advances and properties still
held. Had the directors been told when they
were shivering about the probable effect of
the Australian land tax that their Australian
properties were a better security than their
gilt-edged British investments, they would
certainly have suspected that a lunatic was
talking to them. Yet in the past three years
they have found it necessary to provide over
£150,000 as a reserve on account of invest-
ments and for contingencies.
The present co. (though it has made a
small change in its name, substituting “Mer-
cantile” for “Mortgage”) is 53 years old,
and, so far as this paper can trace it, in
only two years have shareholders not got a
dividend. For a great part of the time they
had 20 p.c. Early in the present century the
co. had a poor time; but its finances are on a
good basis, and so it was able to wait for the
inevitable recovery. Practically all of its
borrowed capital has been raised by the issue
of debenture stock, a little at 3 p.c., the bulk
(£1.900,000) at 4 p.c. It is therefore able
to nurse its lame ducks instead of throwing
them on the market; and the capacity of
Australian pastoral ducks for getting over their
lameness, if given time, is simply astonishing.
Of course it is possible to lose money even
then on this business: all depends upon
when a co. makes the advance —-whether at
the top of one of the recurring pastoral booms
or otherwise. The co. ought to be pretty
right now: for, though prices of wool and
stock would in ordinary circumstances have
produced a boom in station properties, there
have been steadying influences at work. Ad-
vances. generally, have been reduced ; and so
far as this co. is concerned one result is that

on June 30 last, while it owed £470,395 on
aL accounts other than debentures, it had no
less than £1,000,429 in cash, short loans and
gilt-edged investments written down below
market quotatioils. Other assets included
£2,107,278 of pastoral advances and proper-
ties, £203,035 in advances on wool and sun-
dries, and £185,245 in store and office
premises. Like other English cos., it is find-
ing that John Bull isn’t leaving all his war
b.'l for the future. In 1915-16 it paid
£46,183; last year £32.425. In 1910 it
groaned a bit at having to find £7534.
Instead of imposing a wartime-profits tax
which nobody understands and which would
have the effect of heavily penalising those
who show some enterprise in supplying the
country with the things it can’t now import,
while allowing those who do nothing at all
to escape, the Maoriland Government has
substantially increased the land and income
taxes. Under the new scale cos. and indi-
viduals with incomes of £6400 and upwards
will pay 7s. 6d. in the £, with a refund to
shareholders whose income from all sources
does not exceed £4OO per annum. Referring
to the new scale the chairman of the Bank
of New Zealand lately told shareholders: —
To give you an idea of what the increase in
income-tax means to us, I may mention that, on its
assessed income of last year, this bank will contri-
bute about £2X6,500, or an advance of £121,830 on
the amount we |>ajd last year. The former sum is
equivalent to 12.37 per cent, of the total paid-up
capital; in other words, if the present rate of taxa-
tion were to be continued, an amount equal to the
whole of the capital would, in eight years time, be paid
to the Government in the shape of income-tax. Then,
in addition, our land-tax will amount to about
£17,000, and pur contribution to the revenue in the
shape of note-tax will probably be considerably in
excess of £75,000 for the year.
But even so the chairman applauds the
prompt repeal of the excess profits tax after
12 months’ experience had proved it inequit-
able.
.T. E. Donoghue, g.m. of the Electric Light
and Power Supply Corp.—the growing con-
cern which was born in Balmain —is back
from U.S.A., where he went inquiring into
all things that might be useful to his co. One
of the matters lie probed was the practice
with regard to allowances for depreciation.
To this paper it has seemed that the co.
wasn’t writing off enough to cover wear and
tear. In view of the fact (which this paper
admits to be important) that, in addition.
the co. is paying for all repairs and renewals,
the g.m. concludes that the co. is doing more
than American authority declares necessary.
On that point, by the way, there was a
pretty obvious error in B. 10/1/’IS. The
depreciation mentioned there (£5100) was
for a half-year, not for a year.
While it is thinking about reaching out
across the water to Walsh Island and build-
ing real ships there, the Broken Hill Prop,
is pushing on with a little new industry on
its own side of the water. So far it has
bought from outside Australia the ferro-
manganese compound used in turning pig-
iron into steel, but now it is putting in a
plant to make its own. As there’s a good
deal of manganese in Australia there’s no
reason why it shouldn’t.
Mount Booralong, Armidale (N.S.W.), is
opening up its deposit of molybdenite ore by
sinking a shaft 50ft. below the bottom of
No. 1 open cut. The manager reports that
the bottom of the shaft is showing “good
payable ore,” and mentions that a porphyry
formation 200 ft. wide has been proved to
contain molybdenite. There is evidently a
large deposit; but as usual the mineral is
disseminated through the rock (in this ease
porphyry), and it remains for the minei-al
separation process to determine values. It
is all very well to report that the formation
carries 2-J p.c. metal. Just as wolfram con-
centrates are valued on the basis of tungstic
acid, so molybdic acid is the basis for valu-
ing molybdenite concenti’ates.
The N. S, Wales gold-miner is finding
that it isn’t always an advantage to handle
the only stuff that lias a fixed value. The
Mint gives the same for gold no matter what
happens; but the sovereign won’t buy wnat
it used to, in either labor or stores. And
as the margin of profit in N. S. Wales gold-
mining has for many years been very small,
there was a slump last year in the produc-
tion to 85.9540 z. crude, equal to 82,1710 z.
fine, valued at £349,038. The previous year
the yield was worth £459,370. There has
been a steady fall ever since 1905, when
£1,165,013 was reached. With a single ex-
ception (1888) the past year’s figures are
the poorest since the goldfields were dis-
covered in 1850.
In urging shareholders to vote Yes at the
Boulder Perseverance meeting, chairman
Bright, who submitted the liquidation resolu-
tion, said that although the war had greatly
hastened the end he doubted if the outlook
in their case would be muqh improved if
hostilities ended to-morrow. Instructions
had been given to take out all the rich ore
that was left, and when that was done the
plant would be dismantled and put up for
sale. There was still a lot of gold in the
mine, but, like the hundreds and thousands
of tons in the sea, it could not be extracted
without loss. The winding-up motion was
agreed to unanimously.
Kalgoorlie is depressed over the Perse-
verance liquidation, and the local paper dole-
fully declares that the co. ought to have had
more consideration for the town and kept
going on a reduced scale until the war ended.
However, the Board considered that the cost
of looking after the property and plant,
together with a little rooting here and there,
would be too much, and decided to give up
right away. When work became unprofit-
able, orders were given to break out all the
rich ore before closing down. But as the
shrinkage-stope system made it impossible at
times to separate the good from the poor ore,
the co. was unable to do this, either. At
the beginning of 1917 cash, bullion and
investments totalled £26,767 and liabilities
£8155; but losses incurred since then must
have considerably weakened the co.’s financial
position.
Several English shareholders in Oroya
Links (W.A.) are questioning the advi-
sability of the Board’s policy of letting only
the poorer parts of the mine on tribute, and
advocate handing over the entire show to
tributors. Failing that, they suggest early
liquidation, thus assuring a return of about
2s. per share which the co. holds in more or
less liquid assets: The co.’s ss. shares are
worth only a few pence in the market, and
no div. lias been paid since December, 1934,
when there was a threepenny.
Westralia's gold yield for 1917 was
88,000 oz. less in quantity and roughly
£370,000 less in value than for 1916, and little
more than one-third of what it was in the
early ’nineties. Several mines, including two
or three bis shows, closed down during the
year, and as others are likely to follow suit
the prospect of arresting the decline during
the ensuing 12 months is not hopeful.
Some time ago, when interested people
were booming Black Range Pinnacles
(W.A.), there was said to be heaps of gold
to be taken out, and at anything under £2
(they were then about 175.) the shares were
declared to be dirt cheap. Now operations
have ceased, and shareholders have been in-
formed that “in view of the abnormal in-
crease in the cost of mining supplies and
lack of efficient labor it would be suicidal
to carry on any longer.” Not a word about
the refractory and impoverished condition of
the ore at depth, which had more to do with
the co. giving up than anything else; and
shareholders ought to have been tola this
officially when the workings got below water
level.
Tn some notes accompanying the latest
annual report. J. A. Agnew, formerly man-
ager for 8., M. & Co. in Westralia and now
a director of the Lake View and Oroya, has
a word or two to say about what is left of
the co.’s interests in that State. It has, he
declares, been impossible to continue work-
ing without loss at the Lake View and Star,
and in order to keep going the Board
recently decided to restrict milling opera-
tions to a limited tonnage from the higher
grade reserves. This, of course, involves an
increased working cost, which Agnew
reckons is more than counterbalanced by in-
creased recovery, and he expects small profits
to be earned for some months to come. What
effect this cream-skimming will have on the
mine in the long run is not stated, but the
hope is expressed that it will “not seriously
damage the co.’s interests.” Yuanmi, the
only other live holding which the co.
now has in the West, is said to have shown
a gain in ore reserves during the past year,
but like all other shows it has suffered
severely from labor troubles. Yuanmi is one
of the shows 11. C. Hoover used to have an
exalted opinion about. He spent his spare
time calculating what shareholders would get
in divs. if the shoot, which was such and
such a length and such and such a value at
the No. 1 level, lived down a few hundred
feet. It paid 17 £ p.c. while he was doing
this, but nothing since.
Edna May Junction (W.A.). having
acquired a block on Consolidated’s eastern
boundary, has decided to bury the past and
order a new door-plate. In future the co.
will be called the Edna May Consolidated
Extended. Manager W. 11. Collins is put-
ting down a mainshaft on the new property,
and hopes soon to find out the strength of
the show.

If Stuckey’s boring programme at Edna
Deeps (W.A.) is carried out with his usual
luck, he will again put a bloom on the
Westonia rye. Duff has long hankered to
go after the low-grade formation to the west
of the shaft, where he hammered out a
living till the market was readv to swallow
the claim per Alec Peacock’s office. So if
the drill hits a decent prospect out that
way nothing will hold the Melbourne bull
crowd. One of the other bores contem-
plated will be passed down from the bottom
level to where it should catch the point of
the rich shoot on its pitch to the nortn.
This will be a critical drill. The third will
help to define the northern limits of the gold
in the whole shoot. The market approves of
the scheme, because it wants to know what
is underfoot at the Deeps and because it
sighs for a new stimulant to set' the merry
punter jigging once again.
Commodore, Meekatharra (W.A.), called
up all its cash to give Kearn’s neai-oy
Macquarrie lease a go. Assays never
materialised in the battery and the vats, so
it looks as if the eo. got on to another
stringer on that deplorable field. As good
stone has been got close to the boundary in
the lease to the south of the old mine, the
co. will go back there, provided shareholders
agree to a reconstruction to provide the
funds. The job won’t be costly, and it is
not a wise thing in these days to livhtly wind
up a co.
Mount Elliott (Q.) is installing a new
converter to handle matte from Selwyn.
Every preparation has been made lor another
campaign at these works. As a result of
an overhaul of five properties, probable re-
serves have been increased to 040,000 tons
—Mt. Oxide, 250.000; Consols, 400,000;
Great Australia. 180.000; Dobbin, 80,000;
Lady, 30,000. This large tonnage is, how-
ever, calculated on a low basis of value.
For instance, the 180,000 in the Great Aus-
tralia is mostly calcite flux worth from 1 p.c.
to 2 pc. copper. The Dobbin and Lady are
averaged at 5 p.c., and Mt. Oxide gets larger
reserves by the simple process of calculating
tonnage on a 10 p.c. basis.
“J.ILK.”: There is an atmosphere of
stinking fish about “Platman’s” yarn (B.
27/12/T7 ) re the Chillagoe field having-
been proved a blank. There are other dis-
tricts that were “proved” the same way.
For instance, llerberton, one time a tin
centre, now, as a result of systematic pros-
pecting, a copper producer. With few ex-
ceptions nothing was found here at the grass
roots; but sinking on a soft gossany forma-
tion generally unearthed something pay-
able. The Empress, the star show of the field,
has given a net profit of £OO,OOO, and has
a like amount in sight. Nothing was found
in this show above 80ft. My personal ex-
perience is that some of the finest copper
experts are the finest fools. Pick, Shovel
and Co. are an old-established firm and take
a lot of wiping out.

Mt. Bisehoff (Tas.) has declared a two-
and-sixpenny, payable this month, The
new 20 head of heavy stamps are now at
work, and a return of 40 to 50 tons of con-
centrates per month is expected. The last
disclosed figures showed that the cost of pro-
ducing metallic tin was up to £l7O per tun.
So recently as the later half of 1010 Bisehoff
averaged only £175 os. 7d. for its metal; but
there is now a margin of over £lOO. As
there are only 12,0U0 shares, dividends
should be frequent while the metal market
holds up ; but on the foregoing figures it is
absurd to take much notice of present profits
in calculating the value of the mine,

North Mount Farrell (Tas,) closed its
half-year with a credit balance of £4301. It
sells its picked crudes and concentrates to
the Sulphide Corporation, but the difficulty
of shipping bullion has caused a restricted
demand for ore and concentrates. It was
only by careful management and a curtail-
ment of development that working costs
were made to average £1 11s. lOd. per ton of
ore compared with £1 Ss. fid. in the previous
term. The North Farrell has been a good
little mine: it has produced 55.741 tons ore
containing 22,401 tons lead and 2,221,5100 z.
silver. Costs certainly are high, but with
silver and had at present prices it can do
all right.
John Brandon. Dorry Doolette and their
friends have gor firm hold of the Ivingsgate
molybdenite mine: they have collared the
whole issue, not letting the gentle public
have a look-in. The claim was worked in
pre-war days for bismuth, but since molyb-
denite has been so in demand the owner has
had two plants at work to save that mineral.
Brandon's option was at over £20,000 cash,
and as that is provided, war conditions
haven’t emptied the pockets of all the Queen-
street gang. What switched Brandon on to
molybdenite was the success of Alec
Campbell’s King Island scheelite mine.
With that co. making profits Campbell looks
well in the present float, and of course will
be put on to the Board. What hasn’t ap-
peared yet is what water the promoter
squeezes into the float.

shipped from Australia by August. But
production won’t start till close-up six

HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN HAIR
TONIC.
A REMARKABLE RECIPE.
Every trace of scurf and dandruff was
banished —hair that had long been dull and
thin became thick, bright and beautiful,
and, more remarkable still, new hair, plainly
visible to the naked eye, actually grew upon
the patches that had been bald for years.
These are the results a reader is said to
have obtained by simply brushing the hair
gently and regularly, and applving to the
scalp a stimulating tonic composed of 3oz.
Bay Rum, loz. Lavona de Composee, and
i drachm of Menthol Crystals to which was
added a little perfume. Most high-class
chemists can supply these ingredients at
small cost, and the tonic can be quite easily
made up at home. It should be well rubbed
into the scalp night and morning, and the
hair should then be gently brushed for a few
moments. Results are quickly noticeable.
Burning, itching scalp is soothed; hair stops
falling out. New hair begins to grow, and
it becomes bright, soft and luxurious. Such
a tonic, so easily prepared, is certainly
worthy of a trial by every reader who is
suffering from hair or scalp trouble, or
whose hair is turning prematurely grey.—

A WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, January 14, 191 S.
My Dear Akim, —
You can find these Australians anywhere.
The other day The Bulletin discovered one
of them, a Sydney medical student named
Keith Barry, in Baluchistan, helping to
guard the wild nor’-west frontier of India.
He hadn’t heard of another Australian there-
about. But there is one. Dr. Chisholm
Boss, of Sydney, has three sons doing more
than a bit. One of them was in Assam, tea-
planting, when the Big Trouble started. He
I stands behind a gun in Baluchistan now.
Gifford Macarthur King, Lieut.-Colonel,
is among the recent D.S.O.’s. He left here
at the end of 1914 as a major in the Field
Artillery, went through Gallipoli and got
a C.M.G. and a mention in despatches, then
lon to France. He is one of the Macarthur
Onslow clan, and the only son of his mother.
She is Mrs. Agnes King, of Woollalira,
widow of the late Gifford King.
The late John Hurley’s son Lionel (father
used to be member for Hartley), formerly
tin the N.S.W. Agent-General’s office in Lon-
don, caught a small C.M.G. in the New Year
shower. Hurley, now a Lieut.-Colonel, went
to France with the first ambulances given by
this Government. But mostly his job has
been in England, where lie is a deputy-
assistant director of something or other at
Tidworth.
News comes of the solid usefulness of
several Australians now serving their coun-
try in ‘'occupied” territory in the Pacific.
Captain Leach, formerly a Brisbane jour-
nalist, is district-officer in the southern por-
tion of New Ireland, where his tactful man-
agement of Fritz and Fuzzywuz is ironing
out awkward creases. New Ireland is the
place where the ill-fated Marquis du Ray
expedition hoped to found a lesser paradise
on earth.
And then there’s Captain Hunter, district-
officer in charge of the German Solomons.
This Adelaide man is just now on furlough
in his native State after over 12 months’
graft in the sun-kissed isles. Kieta, his
headquarters, is one of the beauty spots of
the Pacific. A lean, wiry Australian, Hunter
goes anywhere and everywhere armed with
a walking-stick. “Terrific heat seems to
glance off his lithe, greyhound frame,” says a
recently-returned Australian, “while his
method of handling both black and white
fills one with admiration. Before the war he
was an accountant in Adelaide. Opportunity
came and found the man. There isn’t a
more respected official m a difficult position
in any enemy colony now occupied by Aus-
tralians. He upholds the white man’s high-
est tradition that his word is his bond.”
Mrs. Martin Egan, who used to write as
Elinor Franklin, is filling her fountain-pen.
! She is on a globe-trotting mission for U.S.A.
papers, and comes this way from Manila.
! Possibly she hasn't seen Martin for five
minutes in the last 12 months. He used to
scour the Seven Seas for copy for Sammy’s
Associated Press. That was in the days of
the Russo-Jap war, when he put in some
time at Tokio and left the impression that
he could squeeze information out of a dead
mandarin. After much running up and
down the earth he has been of late reposing
on velvet as publicity-agent for the million-
aire firm of J. P. Morgan and Co.
The old village of Smithfield, under the
shadow of Prospect Hill, stirred in its sleep
the other day when the local coach unloaded
a cargo of Sydney visitors to wish many
happy returns of their golden wedding to
William Shelley and his wife. Eldest
daughter Amy Croft, whose husband super-
intends the mails for this State, poured out
the tea. The Shelleys are the oldest inhabi-
tants of Tumut, where the original Shelley
pitched his humpy on the best grazing land
in the district, at Tumut Plains, when last
century was still in pinafores. Later on, his
! descendants discovered that the land would
grow wheat also. His wife —Sara Martyr
until 50 years ago—was born on old Rich-
lands station, out behind Taralga, in the
Abercrombie ranges, where her father man-
aged in the long ago for William Macarthur,
the wool-growing knight who owned Camden
Park and other desirable allotments. Her
mother was a Pentland, one of an Irish
family ; another member of it, John Pentland
Mahaffy, is provost of Trinity, Dublin, and
a member of the Irish Convention now try-
ing to soothe the sorrows of the disthressful
counthry. His son, Arthur Mahaffy, who
married a Melbourne girl, Enid Boyd, was
chief sec. in Fiji and deputy-commissioner
for the W. Pacific a few years ago.
The Women’s Hospital (Crown-street) is
to get the collection from a matinee de luxe
on January 29. Hon. organisers Nellie
Leach and E. Card Trouton have stirred our
most exclusive suburbs to unload. 10s. and a
guinea a seat. In the fashion parade the
visions will be worth it. The Rajah’s lady,
Mrs. John Osborne, the Gordon girls and
Barbara Bowker are to flit across the stage
in the latest finery; Olive King has con-
sented to appear in pyjamas; and there’ll be
an Oriental spasm from “The Persian Gar-
den” by Nellie Leach and Goossens. All at
the Tivoli.
A son of the late Scotchbyterian parson
Dill Macky was wed in dad’s old kirk the
other evening. Dick Dill Macky chose a
Strathfield meenister’s lass, Olwen Moi’gan,
for bis bride. The Rev. Tom Tait, for-
merly of Melbourne, tied the knot, and the
wedding party left the ancient Scots’ Church
to step next door and crumble cake at the
Wentworth.
“Do you think we
could sit back?” asks
Mrs. Hugh Ward.
“The America n
woman wasted no
time in organising
her share in civili-
sation’s task. Al-
ready every little
hamlet has turned
its women’s club
into a Red Cross and
war-fund centre.
We’re keen on
organisation at any
time. When the war
came the material
was there—it had
only to be mobilised.
Before the Conscrip-
tion Bill passed, the
pacifists and all the mixed following behind
them promised us a revolution. I was in a
New York shop the day before the first draft
was to be called up, and was seriously
warned to keep indoors next day. ‘The
streets of New York will run red; the city
will be a shambles; thousands of dead and
dying will shed their blood on the pavements
in the fight against Conscription,’ said the
panic-mongers. Everywhere one heard the
same story—the biggest civil war in history
would destroy President Wilson’s attempts
to raise an army. Next day came. Many
women kept indoors, waiting breathlessly for
the sound of guns. In the afternoon I went
out. New York was just as usual—except
for the long queue of eligibles waiting to
register for service. Before the hill was
through there was a rush of volunteers, and
their names are enrolled in the public build-
ing of their town or village as the first
Americans to offer in the cause of the world’s
liberty.
“How does the American woman feel
about it all? Thirty thousand women
marched through N. York while I was there,
carrying banners expressing their joy when
President Wilson declared war on Germany.
The tears will come later, whdn loved ones
fall on foreign soil. But their womenkind
will not murmur. My sister’s son in Pitts-
burg was in the first rush of volunteers, and
gave up a good position to join the army
for France. ‘They’ve accepted me, mother,’
he said. ‘For what?’ said she. ‘l’ve been
up to the recruiting office to enlist.’ And
that American mother just answered quietly,
‘You couldn’t do better, my son!’ ” Here is
the photo, of the lady whose sweet musical
lilt is often a feature at concerts for patri-
otic or charity events. She is the wife, of
course, of Hugh Ward, of “the Firm.”
“Look at that view —right down to North
Head from this window,” she laughs, “and
then say you think I could leave Sydney to
live even in America.”
Another lately-returned American “just
loves little New York.” “Y’ know,” he said,
“this place does look a bit cheap after you’ve
been home. It’s the suburbs as much as any-
thing. Their untidy fences always hurt me.
Here you’ve got something pretty good : next
door there’s a dilapidated wreck of palings.
But it’s glorious out of doors. I just love
getting in the car and running out a few
miles and camping for lunch. Know I never
had a meal home except breakfast during
the holidays? Now, you can’t do that in
New York. There’s no place handy where
you can pull up and camp. Of course there
are plenty of beautiful spots, but they’re
private property. It’s the bush and the
quiet beaches right alongside Sydney that
have got me.”
You remember Dr. Saumarez Smith, my
dear—the kindly old prelate who wore the
first Anglican archgaiters in Sydney and
wouldn’t pay more than a shilling for his
cab fare to Macleay-street? His daughter
Ursula, who has been'teaching young Binghi
at the abo. mission station at Yarrabah
(N.Q.), is announced as engaged to parson
J. T. Perry, lately chaplain at the mission.
Her sister is married to W. H. Stevenson,
who expounds the Word in a Brisbane sub-
urb, and was once genthelp or something
to the late Archgaiters.
The Countess Morner, who was Mrs.
Henry White, left Sydney the other day for
the United States. Before she went she con-
fided the interesting fact that she was going
to be married over there. The gentleman
who has tempted her into a third matri-
monial venture is, she says, literary.
Thirty officers drew in their chairs at the
Wentworth Hotel on Friday to farewell
Colonel “Bob” Owen, retiring commandant of
the Menangle Light Horse Camp. Lieut.
“Dad” Drummond, D.C.M., mess president,
was in charge of the jolly assembly, which also
included Brig.-General George Lee, D.S.O.
(District Commandant) ; Brig.-General J.
M. Antill, the incoming camp commandant;
and Lieut.-Colonel R. W. Lenehan, V.D.
After the cigars and good stories had gone
round, a general advance was ordered on
one of the theatres.
Major Shillington has given up the heart-
breaking job of organising-secretary to the
State Recruiting Committee. Tue thorny
task of beating up unwilling eligibles is now
made harder by the shuffling of the Prime
Minister out of his pledges and the terrible
delay in practical repatriation work. Quiet
and tactful, Shillington (who has done his
bit and can’t get the doctors to pass him
again) had the regard of his colleagues in
the “Where-are-tlie-lads?” office. The women
officials added their token of goodwill to the
male staff’s farewell gifts.
As Sir Harry Barron was Cocked Hat at
Perth when the Sydney captured the Emden,
he was detailed to hand over the piece of
plate and medals which Westralia bought
with a shilling subscription for the cruiser’s
officers and men. Altogether £4OO was thrown
in the hat, and the proceeds were recently
delivered on the vessel’s deck under a foggy
English sky.
The Aubrey Murray family— lie's a
brother of the Papuan Excellency—are in
trouble about their second son, Gilbert. He
has been reported wounded and missing. The
young man was named after his learned
uncle, the Oxford don, whose wife. Lady
Mary Murray (a daughter of the Earl of
Carlisle), is hustling round looking for a
ti’ace of the Sydney lad.
It was Lady Mary Murray, by the way,
who classed ostentatious weddings in war-
days as “unthinkable.” So her daughter
astonished smart society by driving up with
father to a London registrar’s office and link-
ing her hand in her new husband’s without so
much as one fashionable bonnet in the offing.
Not so many years
ago two small heels
made a great clatter
under the Harry
Rickards manage-
ment. The orchestra
was often half a beat
behind. It wasn’t
young enough to
keep up with the
fairy patter of seven
or eight summers,
which dances like
the morning breeze,
because it must. At
seven Eileen Boyd
was doing a child
“turn” in the music-
halls of Maoriland,
with whistling and
clogs to back up her
lilt. Since then she has travelled far and
seen the wonders of the world. At 17 she
was a pupil of the kindly Steffani. who with
his wife pulled up the family sticks and left
for Paris, taking the Sydney girl under his
wing. Later she went to London to com-
plete her vocal gymnastics under Sir Henry
Wood. A luscious contralto is the result.
After eight years’ absence and a wide pro-
fessional experience—she was with the Butt-
Rumford Red Cross tour last year—Eileen
has come home to tell mother and daddy all
about it.
Though still a pretty little girl in appear-
ance, Eileen is a war-widow. Married to Cap-
tain Roberts, R.N.R., about three years ago,
her husband broke, down under the pressure
of taking troops to and from the Dardanelles.
“Just what that meant,’’ says the contralto,
with brimming eyes, “was this. My hus-
band, at any time a delicate man, given to
worry about his responsibility, was often
three days and nights on the bridge, watch-
ing for submarines, and the strain was
awful. On his last trip to England he was
promised a fortnight’s leave, but he couldn ? t
be spared. In days he was sent back
to duty and fell from the transport’s bridge.
‘Double paralysis due to overwork’ was the
verdict.
“On the voyage out we —my small son is
two years old—rammed a submarine and
travelled with a hole in our bow to St.
-John’s, Nova Scotia. We had 1700 passen-
gers on board, including 500 Canadian wives
and widows returning with their children.
But there was no panic or excitement: we
stood with our lifebelts on, waiting to take to
the boats, till that danger was past. Oh, it’s
good to be home —you just don’t know what
war means in this beautiful country,” sighs
the little widow. I send you a little picture
of her bonnie face.
Among the “Bing Boys” now grinning at
Her Majesty’s audiences, Minnie Love is the.
most expensive charmer. She finishes up, so
far as the boys are concerned, in a frock of
molten gold that appears to have been
poured on to a Chinese pagoda, set aside to
cool, then passed on with its peaked skirt
and gold topknot to Minnie; There’s an all-
feather frock in icecream pink for which the
ostrich has suffered heavy losses. A hat of
the same, only more so, sets quarter of an
acre of fluff waggling on the lady’s yellow
locks.
Visitors from Hay district, Mr. and Mrs.
Roy McLean, are housed in Sydney for a
few months, and then the bush will reclaim
them. Mrs. McLean was once a Dixie; she
grew up in the Fog and annexed her husband
in Belgium, whither he went in khaki and
she on a Red Cross job. The pair are re-
lated to the Edgecliff family of that ilk, one
of whom, Matron Hester McLean, of Maori-
land, recently got honors for pioneer war-
work in Egypt.
A line from Brisbane:—
Among the Year honors was a decoration for
war-work for George Frederick Davidson, who has
won distinction as an engineer in England. A Bris-
bane Grammar bov, lie passed on to Sydney Uni., and
won a travelling scholarship in engineering, which
took him to Cambridge about eight years ago. Since
then he has been at engineering works in Newcastle
until the outbreak of war, when he was put in
charge of a munition factory at Leeds. He is one of
the first members of the new British Empire Order.
When Mrs. Abbott came north to gather £6OOO
for the Scottish Women’s Hospital there was con-
siderable doubt as to her prospects of success. But
Caledonia knows how to give as well as make, and
thus far Queensland has put £7200 in the hat,
with an expense sheet of less than £420.
W. F. Dunn, M.L.A., the ex-school teacher
who recently returned from the Front —he
is still on the invalid list—was married in
Mudgee the other evening to Minnie
Durrington.
There’s to be the annual party —this year
makes the fourth —in St. Vincent’s Hospital
Nurses’ Home on January 23. It’s a gas-
light gathering, with progressive euchre and
music.
The Governor-General’s intelligence de-
partment will be henceforth in charge of
A.D.C. Clifford, who takes the Private Sec.’s
chair lately occupied by Francis Harman.
The latter hailed from Samoa and looked
after the Fairguson’s letters for about six
months.
Brisbane will supply a new curate to St.
James’s. His name is Collis, or something
(hat sounds like it. and he once saved souls
iii Borneo. Meanwhile the amiable James
Cheong charms even the stern verger with
his silky manners. He stepped into the
breach for love, as he’s on holiday from his
Molbouime tabernacle.
You can’t look at a Path 6 picture of an
honors-giving scene presided over by King
George without noticing that the royal left
knee twitches continuously. War nerves, no
doubt. A grey beard lias also been acquired
since the trouble started and thrones began
to tumble.
The Darling Point limb of the A.M.C. is
going to resume its knitting on January 17.
Yours affectionately.

My Dear Yarrie, —-
Lady Helen, attended by gentlielp Kerr-
Pearse, went to the Princess’s on Friday
night to see the last of Allan Wilkie in
“For the King.” It was a special military
performance in aid of the Red Cross Rest
Home, and was worked up by the nurses,
aided and abetted by Bishop, who is presi-
dent of the Rejected Volunteers’ Association.
The bar of the theatre (now cleared of liquid
refreshment) was occupied by nurses with
sweets and kewpies for sale.
Lady Helen sat in the centre of the dress
circle along with Matron Milne, of the Rest
Home, and Matron Anderson, of Caulfield.
The stalls were full of white-coiffed girls,
and lots of the darlings were dodging about
with baskets of dolls dressed in battalion
colors. Mrs. Billy Hughes sat in a box
with Billy’s secretary, Mr. Dean, and his
brand-new wife. John Forrest and his wife
were there. Sol Green lurked in another
box, where he was found and besieged.
Young Bishop aforesaid has a great
scheme in hand to put up a new Red Cross
Kitchen. He and other rejects intend to
make a one-day building job of it, and they
are rounding up carpenters and other crafts-
men. The organiser is a son of Archdeacon
Bishop, of Bendigo.
A new idea for Red Crossers. Mrs. Massey
is helping the Wellington (M.L.) lot make
a name-quilt similar to one she saw in an
English hospital. It had been produced in
Dunedin and was a patchwork of names
worked by people who had boys at the Front.
The wounded soldiers found great interest
in searching for names they knew. Welling-
ton is fairly on the job now, and doubtless
other towns' and districts will follow suit.
Word floats in from Colombo that Arthur
Harris (who married Carmen Pinschof) has
enlisted with an English regiment which he
will shortly join. When hubby leaves for
the trenches Carmen intends visiting Mel-
bourne.
Slender Mrs. Leroy Burnham, who in pre-
war days as Margaret Niall cheered many
a dull social function, has just sent a cable
to papa, re brother Arthur, who was posted
missing. He is in the hands of the Bodies,
.a prisoner, but well. Leroy Burnham was
aide to the Denmans and was winged during
the retreat from Mons.
The Frank Grey Smiths’ elder daughter,
Mona, has taken over Marian Campbell’s
job as hon. sec. to the Y.M.C.A. Soldiers’
Tub in St. Ivilda-road. It’s a real long-
('ljinnee job, lasting from 9 a.m. until 9
p m and needs a girl with a cartload of
energy . A ud R () od temper.

Archpush-up Mannix has retired to the
tree-fernery cloisters of Lome, the Western
District’s most exclusive sea-sidery, and pro-
mises to shut off steam for a month while
lie is dipping his toes in the ocean, so kindly
kept free of submarines by the brutal
British.
A Military Medal case that appeals speci-
ally to Melbourne softgoods, apart from per-
sonal friends of the medallist, is that of Pri-
vate A. B. Sanders, of the A.M.C. He is a
member of the old Leviathan clothing firm,
one of Melbourne’s gilded johnnies, and he
won his bauble by brave work in a service
where honor and glory don’t come much in
the workers’ way. Private A. B. Sanders
got his M.M. for gallantry in stretcher-
bearing.
Our late Ex. Carmichael lost the bulk of
his great collection of Australian black opals
in one of the torpedoed boats. One piece
remains safe in Australia, and that was a
wedding gift to Mrs. Harrison, wife of oUr
Flying major. It is a magnificent piece
with the Southern Cross set sheer into the
jewel in diamonds. Some nivstical diamond
letters are interwoven on another facet.
The Frank Mitchell daughter put her name
down for enlistment as probationary nurse,
and Auntie Melba gave her an encouraging
pat on the hack. But the young enthusiast
felt rather injured when Melbourne Hospital
called her up on Christmas Eve.
Sister Constance Murray, a sister of our
Mrs. Clyde Norton, of Toorak. was lately
transferred to England, after many months’
service in France, and is now at the new
Hospital for Nurses at Soiithwall Terrace,
London. The Nightingales call it "The
Nunnery,” as it is staffed by women, and is
for women only. But as Dr. Henry Maudsley
is in charge, male wags call it, in the Cockney
tongue, “Henery’s Hennery.” The hospital,
given by a rich Australian, Mrs. Hall, was
opened by Andrew Fisher some months ago.
It is fitted to perfection.
The ordination of H. It. Potter as an
Anglican priest by ArchgaiteSs Clarke the
other day establishes an Australian record.
Potter’s father, who is an archdeacon at
Wangaratta, was ordained in 1886 at Bal-
larat by Bishop Thornton; and his father.
Canon Potter, now deceased, got his “orders”
in 1859 from Dr. Perry, who then bished
at Melbourne. There is no other instance of
a third generation of Anglican priests, all
ordained in this country. The call of the
collection plate runs in the family; old
Canon Potter’s father looked after one in
Ireland, and his brother was the first Angli-
can archdeacon in Ballarat.
Miss Adelaide’s evidence :
Josiah Sytnon has passed over to the Art Gallery
Frederick Chester’s painting, “Making Hay While
the Sun Shines,” which came to Australia for the
Sydney Jubilee Exhibition. The canvas was bought
there by the late Alexander Hay, but the K.C. has
owned it for some years. The Symons’ eldest son, by
the way, has won the M.C. He is an adjutant in the
Coldstream Guards.
Birkenhead, which is more or less part of Port
Adelaide, is a cheerful spot to inhabit these days.
The wheat-stacks along the wharves are swarming
with weevils, which are overflowing to the houses and
shops and crowding out the adjacent resident. The
insects are literally in masses, smothering any food
that is left uncovered, dropping from the ceilings
and attaching themselves firmly and impartially to
saint and sinner. They have to take in the saints
because there are not enough sinners to go round. One
desperate shopman painted his building with sheep-
dip, but that gave only temporary peace.
The Wattle Day League’s final count of its Button
Day takings showed that the effort netted over
£2OOO towards the hospital wing which the League
hopes to build and equip at Keswick.
Two S. Australians, Surgeon-Colonel Hayward and
Major E. J. Sexton, figure in the list of the new
Order of the British Empire.
Died at Norwood on Sunday, Mrs. A. A. Allen,
well known in musical circles as Miss Murielle
Woods. She was married only a short time ago.
The U.S.A. gave a healthy account of mem-
bership: and finance at its annual meeting. The
number on the roll is 3000, and the assets are over
£l6OO. There is a heap of work for the assoc, to
do, if only in the direction of galvanising the
authorities into some practical effort to deal with
the problem of returned men before the end of the
war unloads them on us in thousands. Captain
Blackburn, V.C., was re-elected president. An
effort is being made to give a fresh start to the
Returned Soldiers’ toy factory, which began here
under Government auspices, but did not flourish.
The Cruickshanks have had news of the death of
their only son Errol, who was' killed in action in
France on Christmas Day. He was in the Gallipoli
landing, and remained on the Peninsula till the
evacuation, coming through the fighting there and in
France safely till he joined, the Great Host. Lieut. R.
G. Raws, son of the Rev. John Raws, who has been
missing since July, 1916, has also been officially
reported killed.
We are to have another league—-the Liberty League
-—whose business it will be to oppose “intemperate
legislation” especially as it affects amusements,
sports and the rest. Bert Sayers is president, George
Auld and James Hall vice-presidents.
The S. 11. Officer widow, who was to have
gone to Tassy for son Cairns’s wedding with
Louise Sexton, called a halt in a private
hospital. Whilst hurrying down the Col-
lins-street incline she caught her foot on the
pavement and was upset. The result was
an injured hip, which will take some weeks
to recover.
Henry Cornish and his smart little
missus, back from a five months’ ramp
through Tahiti and Maoriland, have un-
packed in a South Yarra flat, and Mrs.
Henry is once more busy on Braille work
for blind Anzaes. In July the pair box up
for the Bermudas. They have got the travel
habit badly.
“Bandbox” Brown, of Hobart, has been
nibbling his daily bread at Menzies’ for the
past few weeks. He is the Wallington of
Tasmania, and jogged the elbow of more
Governors than you would think, for he is
a time-defying person with a deceptive
suggestion of youth about him.
Young Bob Brownless, of South Yarra,
has just returned from th<h wars. He is a
grandson of knight Anthony Brownless, a
whilom Chancellor of the University. His
grandmother was a niece of Catherine
Hayes, the singer of pleasant memory. Bob
is one of Daigety’s promising young men
and fought at Gallipoli, Pozieres and Gaude-
court, and in the last engagement had the
rough luck to lose his left leg.
The Crevellis have received news of the
marriage in France of son Louis, the lucky
mademoiselle being Yvonne Houet, of Paris.
The engagement was announced some time
ago, and the lady’s photograph is a charming-
recommendation. Louis is in the French
A.M.C.
Colonel Kent Hughes’s daughter was a
fifth-year med. at Melbourne Uni. when sen-
sational things happened, and she became a
wife and a widow within a few days. But
these things failed to interrupt the even
tenoh of her studies. She has duly
finished her course at the Shop and
has just established a record by be-
coming the first woman doctor to hold
a resident-surgeon’s job at the Geelong Hos-
pital. Dad himself, by the way, is nowa-
days doctoring soldiers at Petrograd, unless
since latest advices he has been Bolshed or
transferred to serener scenes.
The language of the battlefield is infec-
tious. Archie Whyte, Prime Minister
Hughes’s publicity agent, is about town
boasting that his wife captured an eight-
pounder in Christmas week. He has been
christened John Stirling Whyte.
Mrs. Tom Carrington, a sister on the inky
way, who was wielding a pen with ease and
dignity when many of us sported pigtails,
passed out last week. As “Queen Bee,” Mrs.
Carrington supplied the Australasian with
formal conversation concerning the doings of
the Very Best People for 30 years. Lately
she had been ailing, and was helped in her
work by her two accomplished daughters.
There was nothing of the Bohemian
in the dead penwoman; She had very
definite ideas about the dignity of
her calling, and it says much for
her personality that she forced the snob-
ocracy to accept her at her own valuation,
even in the days when journalists were
looked upon as quaite impossible. All who
know them feel much sympathy for “Queen
Bee’s” daughters and her widower, Tom
Carrington, who was one of Victoria’s earli-
est black-and-white artists, and has done the
theatrical first nights for the Argus for
many years,
None but his own family and the pr'nter
ever know the name of the printer’s devil.
When John Pascoe Fawkner, in ’3B, started
to rake Melbourne news together with a pen
( that was before he got the old press now in
Melbourne Public Library) he hired a boy
named John Brophy, and young John did his
job with pen and press and grew up and left
without ever getting his name on the early
journalistic records. His youngest daughter,
Catherine Frances Brophy, died in a Malvern
private hospital after operation last week.
Though she was no writer herself she had
a keen eye for character and a good story,
and was cheery to the last, nobody but herself
suspecting that the end of her own tale was
very near. Her nephew “Kodak” recollects
that she always disliked telling stories with
a tragic finish.
The McCubbins. mourning their genial
artist dad, are up at their house,
which hangs from a garden on the Woodend
side.
Last week-end the gentle and gracious
Dolores jaunted to Tasmania with profes-
sional and Cross ends in view. For the
first time since the Huns began to devastate
her native land the Dolores is using her
Voice for her own profit as well as the profit
of the Cause. Her first concert at Hobart
was billed for this Wednesday.; The trip
will last three weeks, and the songstress
thinks of it as a pleasant preliminary to
another tour.
The London Royal Academy of Music
examiner, V. Hathaway, has seen moi’e of
Australia than many Australians, for it is
his job to tour the country judging the scale
players and howling dervishes. He has just
been joined by his good-looking missus, who
has been nursing in a military hospital in
Rouen.
“The Navy Now,” sung in “Aladdin” by
Andrew Higginson, was written and com-
posed by Higgy all by himself. The once-
adored beauty mummer is not the merry
Andrew we knew in “Merry Widow” days.
He is a very subdued, domesticated person
and an industrious worker. Daisy Rivette,
who reveals a pleasing figure as Prince
Pekoe, is Mrs. Andrew.
The Sassiety regiment paraded at dearly
full strength in the front stalls to see the pet
musicians, Edward Cahill and George
Brookes, begin their vaudeville career at the
Tivoli. It was a crowded Saturday-night
house, and the fine musical turn went with
a roar. Two laurel wreaths were sent and
barrowloads of flowers; but the youths
wisely had them side-tracked to the stage-
door in dread of the howls of the gods.
Muriel Starr has perched herself on the
heights of Toorak in Huyton, St. George's-
road, the humpy of Mrs. Lyon. She has
already given the Toorakians something to
chatter about, as at Christmas time she was
serenaded by the Hawaiian Ukulele Band,
now appearing in “The Bird of Paradise.”
The Xaicest do so love a free show ! And
it delights the show people to give it to them
if it means a good ad.
The ever-moving Freddie Shipman pair
spent Christmas in Japan and sent a cooee
to Australia from Nagasaki.
Mallacoota Inlet, the faraway fishing
place 'which used to be sacred to the male
sport who left his women in softer places, is
in danger of becoming fashionable. This
year several women strapped their suit-cases
on to the motor and trundled there with the
men. Mrs. Felix Meyer, a delicately-fair
University girl, went with her doctor hus-
band in the wake of Allenby, a busy Roads
Boards man. Critchley Parker, of the
Mininci Standard, arrived the day after the
referendum, and his sporty wife went to
help untangle the fishing-lines. The widow
Horsfall also arrived surrounded by the halo
of her banking account. A plucky maiden
from Ivew, Miss Larkins, ran her own car
through the forests from Melbourne and then
carried her mother and three men-cousins on
to Sydney.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

A SAFE PROTECTOR
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Eracle” : Barcoo rot, veldt sore of South
Africa and septic trouble of Egypt are all due to
the same cause —a small bacillus. Prcf. Martin,
pathologist of the 3rd A.G. Hospital, studied it
when stationed in Abassia (Cairo). Some of our
soldiers developed sores which they called Barcoo
rot, and they were right. The important point to
remember in the treatment is that the responsible
little devils spread through the hairs of the skin;
sometimes they squeeze themselves into the hair-
roots. Prof. Martin discovered this and advised
A.M.C. doctors to pull off the hair about one inch
around the sore. We did that and painted the
skin with strong iodine; any ointment over the sore
would do. As a result no sores would develop and
the patient would be well in a few days.
“True Bill” : Talking of diseases peculiar
to the Outback reminds me of the blindness that
prevailed 30 years ago in the Never-Never of Western
Queensland, caused by flies from the filthy and
unholy blacks’ camps attached to the stations. It
wasn’t safe to allow a fly to get near the eye. The
few white babies there were had to have their heads
encased in mosquito-net during the daytime. The
saddest sight was that of strong, hefty men and bonnie
boys and girls, quite blind —nothing to be seen of
the eye but a white slit. The disease and scandal
became so great that the Government sent up experts
to take a hand. One of the first things ordered was
the dispersal of the nigger camps. I well remember
as though ’twere a nightmare a drive of 18 hours
in an open buckboard with an infant supposed to
have contracted the awful disease (there was yellow
mucus in the corner of the eye)—the blistering
sun, the swimming of the billabongs and creeks (it
was flood-time), the broken traces, the drowning
of the horses, the arrival at the doctor’s at 2 a.m. to
be soundly cursed for waking him out of his sleep,
and finally the verdict that the kid had a cold in
its head!
“Barcoo”; You’ll agree that it is impos-
sible to ; carry water in open petrol-tins or oil-
drums suspended from a vehicle. Right. Well,
here’s a simple remedy. Throw a couple of handfuls
of eucalyptus leaves on top of the water, and not
enough will escape to give a mosquito a decent
drink. Another inconvenience picnickers and mug
bushmen suffer from is water smoked when boiling
the billy. To obviate this get two green twigs,
trim them of leaves and lay them across the top of
the vessel. The water can then be boiled with
impunity and the most sodden twigs available.
“Captain”: When my New Guinea boy
whom I had sent with a note to a neighboring
planter reached the house' he could see no one
about, so he “chanced an eye” through a French
window. What he saw and heard rattled him
badly, and, not waiting to deliver the missive, he
broke all records for home. In a frenzy of excite-
ment he opened out: “Me go longa house belonga
other fella master. Me lookem. Missus belonga
other fella master stop longa house. Missus take
lik lik bokhus (little box). She put him
longa big fella bokkus (piano). She sit longa top
lik. lik bokkus. Missus open mouth (lid) belonga
big fella bokkus, fightem teeth (piano keys) plenty
strong too much. Big fella bokkus he cry too
much. Me fright. Me go.”
“Timberite”: The 70ft. ironbark pole
mentioned in a recent Bulletin by “Jackdaw”
would require a long ladder, to reach to the top of
the stick that raised the mill-funnel at Mount Rous,
Richmond River (N.S.W.), in September, 1898. Cut
at the first limb, this pin provided a 92ft. sheer-leg
to swing the 110 ft. tube on to its 12ft. high
pedestal. The stack weighed 20 tons and bent the
back of the straining ironbark, but up she went
without any trouble.
POOR SPORTS.
BUSHMAN : “ I’d like to see him chuck young
Bob!”
OLD BOB: “You loafer phella like it plurry
fun, you do! That yarraman break it
young Bob neck, baal you pay it
doctor.”
“Canine Lover”: This is not known to
everybody, but it ought to be. Five or six eggs
beaten up and poured into a dog that is strychnine-
poisoned will make him as good as new.
“S. S. Severn”: I think I found more
superstition in the quiet places in England than I
did in equal time in Papua. One day last spring
Margaret and I were mooning along Madeira Walk
in Falmouth, when I noticed a kind of little umbrella
fern twirling round and round amongst the under-
growth. It whirled at such a rate and in so strange
a fashion (really as though someone were rolling it
between the palms) that I stood watching it. And
suddenly it seemed as though a tiny man about a
foot high, dressed all in grass green, with big and
very bright eyes, and wearing a high green cap, were
standing beside the fern staring up at me. As I
watched he faded away. When we got home I told
our landlady about him, feeling that she would laugh
at my fancies. She did not. She said there must
be very few of the Little Green Men left now. She
had never seen one herself; but her grandmother
had, many years ago. And to be prepared for bad
news. Which came.
AN IMPOSITION.
COHEN (who has been asked for a subscription to the Disabled Firemen’s charity): “Vat!
Give you a thubthcription! V’y, you're the ruination of bithness.”
“Ritasun”: Now that the stacks put by
last harvest are being dismantled in Northern Vic.
thousands of mummified mice are being brought to
light. Every crevice is chock-a-block with them.
They evidently sought shelter from the cold, and,
having lived their fleeting period, died. Some of
the groups of corpses are in quaint formation, all
headed one way. Cocky in those parts reckons that
the pest is done with —anyhow, for a time. But is
it? Echuca way thousands of mice, alive and
hearty, are making themselves at home. Only one
thing is certain, and that is that the suicidal mad-
ness of exterminating the native birds, particularly
the night-owl, mopoke and curlew, is pi'oducing its
aftermath; and when the locust hordes come, and
the frogs, and the pumpkin beetles, and the green
grubs, the lesson will be driven home with the
mallet of remorse.
Mrs. Lance Rawson: In the late ’fifties
r small live tortoise was found embedded in coal
it Newcastle (N.S.W.) 400 ft. below surface. Mr.
Kean, the then Government Geologist, had the little
creature for many years in a globe of water in his
drawing-room till it grew too big and was passed
on to the museum. When first released from its
coal bed it measured a shade over an inch in
length, but in six weeks’ time it had grown to five
and a half inches. It took a very long time to
attain any considerable size, however.
* * * *
“Tongio”; A wayback from the Omeo
Plains made a fuss the other day over a trifle. He
was a passenger on the Melbourne train and fol-
lowed the rush into the refreshment bar. His por-
tion of steak and kidney pudding was rapidly vanish-
ing, when he went up-counter to hunt for butter.
Presently he returned and continued his feed. It
was when he looked for his tea that the trouble
started. The cup was empty, though he hadn’t drunk
any. It occurred to him at this point that on return-
ing with the butter he had taken on someone else’s
leavings. He was making his troubles heard when
an ancient and very insanitary Chow chipped in and
accused him of stealing his dinner. The next I
saw of the cocky he was on the platform looking
very unwell.
* * * *
“Ghooliman”: There are several other
howls that can be forwarded as far as “coo-ee.”
Place your hands to your mouth and try “koo-who-
whoo,” raising the voice upon each syllable. Years
ago Dick Bradley, whom I worked for out Cool-
gardie way, used to swell his neck like a gohanna
when you pelt a rock at him, and beef out “Yah-
hoo! ” The farthest man in the gang never missed it.
* » * *
“Machete”: Those Queensland kids who
yarded up a mob of snakes in a hollow log (B.
6/12/’l7) in all probability butted into the middle
of a courting bee. These gatherings are as char-
acteristic of snake society as they are of more
exalted circles, and in both cases the lady’s admirers
are liable to get into holts with each other in the
presence of the blushing and palpitating prize.
‘“Capital”: If Andy Fisher could see
Canberra now he would, as a true Scot, be proud of
his godchild. The wet season has suited the weeds
all to pieces on the flats along the Molonglo, and
there’s about the finest show of Scotch thistles, star
thistles and variegated thistles in Australia. The
Scots thistles are the bonniest of the lot, forests of
them 7ft. high, and so thick in places that a rabbit
has to back out if he wants to scratch himself.
Indeed, what with Bathurst burrs and about a thou-
sand other weeds as well as the thistles, the capital
site can show as representative a collection of Aus-
tralian vegetable pests as any goat could wish for.
MORE WAR-TIME ECONOMY.
THE JACKEROO : “Hullo, mate, what’s that
you’ve got on your swag?”
THE SWAGGIE “ That’s me taximeter.
Bought her last time I was in Sydney.
She ain’t too good on the mileage, hut I
reckon I’ve saved £7369 in fares by
walkin ’ since I’ve ’ad ’er."
(Continued on page 24.)
BILLO'S POINT OF VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the rock that’s like a pillow
And the homes of business fleas
‘Came the bottle merchant Billo
With his old horse Socrates.
Down the steep hill to the ferry
Billo picked his zigzag way;
And I thought his face seemed very
Thoughtful—for a Saturday.
On the kerb his cartwheel grated
And the bottles grated too,
While he slewed his load and waited
As old friendship bade him do ;
And methought I heard him mutter
Kindly words of blasphemy.
And he spat into the gutter—
And I spat in sympathy.
Maybe, out amongst the wattles,
At a villa spick and span,
Where he went for empty bottles,
lie had met a wowser man.
Or a woman with a mission;
Or a long speech made last night
By a puppy politician
Had raked Billo up orlright.
But the strength he gave me of it,
With an elbow on the shaft;
And I listened, to my profit,
While the Harbor water laughed.
Billo blinked at three-legged Brunno —
Dog that everybody knew —
And he opened out with “Dunno
What the world is cornin’ to.
“Wot them wowser blokes is givin’
Us is more than I can tell.
We don’t wanter go ter Heaven,
We don’t wanter go ter Hell 1
I’m a fool, an’ you are clever;
Both is mugs, an’ get bn fine;
Bottles full is your endeavor,
Empty bottles is my line.
“I ain’t one as turns me nose up
At each blessed thing I sees;
When I dies and turns me toes up
I jest want a little ease ;
I jest only wanter getter
Where I’ll have a beer, an’ kiss,
In a world a little better
An’ a little worse than this.
“What the Union crowd is doin’
I am damned if I can say;
We don’t wanter go ter ruin,
We don’t want a quid a day ;
We just want a bit er clobber,
An’ when things ain’t goin’ right
We can always find a cobber
Who will buck us up to fight.
“This old strike will be forgotten,
Like a hundred strikes before,
And the War be dead an’ rotten
When we have another war ;
And you’ll see the landsharks swimmin’
On the outskirts of the fray,
While weak men an’ lyin’ wimmin
Muck things up the same old way.
“For the sum of all this scrappin’
When yer use yer comminsense,
Is that nothing that can happen
Never makes no difference.
So I give it to you, knowin’
Mates are mates, say what they please—
There’s the punt! I must be goin’.
So long! Geddup, Socrates!”
Then I dreamed a space, and started ;
For it seemed another day,
And we just had met an’ parted,
Casual, on the Appian Way.
Gown and wreath and mail and helmet
(Over Time victorious)
Just two ancient Romans well-met,
Billo and Lawsonius.

“Power Personified”
ALADDIN used to summon his
genii when he desired to be
whisked away into other parts.
Nowadays, motorists call for Plume,
the “Magic Spirit of to-day,” when
prodigies of speed and power are
needed.
Get-there motorists “bank” on Plume.
They enthusiastically insist that it (rives
them a greater run for their money. They

“Phil Anthus”: “Jimmie Pannikin’s”
observations of the brolgas’ cheery habit of playing
eatch-as-catch-can with sticks (B. 6/12/’l7) move
me to remark that the big wedge-tailed eagles
(usually slighted with the title of eaglehawk) have
been known to take on a similar game. But these
sports bring their wings into play instead of run-
ning about like the cranes. Grabbing a back-log
from the earth an eagle will take it aloft in it 3
claws, drop it from a big height, and hook the
timber again in masterful style before it has finished
its whirling career southward. Most birds play
some game or other. The shining starlings of North
Queensland often give delightful exhibitions of
tumbling in mid-air, and I’ve frequently seen the
yellow 7 -tufted honeyeaters of southern Australia in-
dulge in corroborees c-f the most hilarious and fan-
tastic kind.
* * * *
“Bung”: “V.D.’s” theory that westerly
gales divert the Australian southerly Pacific current
seawards is probably correct. It is a known fact,
however, that a constant northerly undercurrent of
cold water traverses the eastern coast. For months
after the steamboat Bega went under off Cuttagee
beach some years ago, boxes of butter were swept
ashore many miles to the northward, and coal from
a sunken collier near Montague Island is regularly
strewn along the beaches as far north as Ulladulla.
FORCE OF HABIT.
BILL THE SHEARER ( absent-mindedly after
wounding his man ): “Tar ’ere!”
“Murkah”: A recent cold snap pinched
a pair of swallows that were nesting with a brood
under a verandah at Rooty Hill (N.S.W.). The
task of feeding and keeping the infants warm was
beyond the capacity of the two small parents, and
apparently the S.O.S. call was sent out last night.
Anyhow, by the light of a candle seven tails were
counted projecting from the nest. To my mind this
indicates the power of communication, and it aston-
ished me. I’d be glad to know if “E. 5.5.,” “Leo
Lear” and the mob generally would have been equally
flabbergasted.
PONIES—OR THE OTHER SORT?
BROTHER SNIFFES: “ Friend, will you come to our meeting?”
SPORTING GENT: “Vot is it, registered or unregistered?”
“Copabella”: The city fathers were dis-
cussing shrubs for the new park. The curator had
recommended a few Grevillea Robusta for a certain
situation. “Look ’ere, Mr. Mayor,” protested Cr.
Malaprop, “I’m an Australian, an’ I’m against
gorilla-busters 1 What’s the matter with native
things, I’d like to know?” After some discussion
the recommendation was adopted with the under-
standing that the curator would see that the Grevil-
lea was quite free from foreign disease.
“Eddyson”: Talking of the loneliness of
the bush with an old bushman, he drew my attention
to a peculiar development. I was able to verify his
idea with many experiences of my own. Said the
bushman: “The bush isn’t so lonely that it drives
them livin’ in it to break their necks lookin’ for
company. 1 know of fam’ly after fam’ly in the most
desolatest places who never speak to each other from
yeaf’s end to year’s end. There be whole fam’lies of
seven or eight who ain’t playin’ speaks, and haven’t
been for years past, ’n’ most probable won’t be for
3-ears to come. They tell of a chap out of Wagga,
New South, that’s had tellvphone wires run along his
fences to a neighbor’s three miles off. He’s got
rheumatics so bad he often can’t stir, but he don’t
speak to his wife ’n’ won’t. One day the neighbor
had him yellin’ over the tellvphone, ‘Fer Gorsake,’
he said, ‘ring up my wife ’n’ tell her the
horses is in at the wheat!’”
“Pick”: When help is called from mates
in the bush the soldier-bird is no shirker. I was
attracted by violent language and ever-increasing
numbers to a big manna-tree on the Monaro
(N.S.W.). Reinforcements were streaming in from
all points, and as they whirled among the forest
of limbs I saw the soldiers were fighting a blue
falcon. Though a much larger bird, he was several
times beaten off his perch by the onslaughts. Then
I discovered that his apparent helplessness was owing
to his having a young bird in his claws, so I
shoved into the argument with a Winchester, and,
as the chicken-killer fell to the ground, many of
the enemy thr"'bed feathers out of him, while others
escorted away the little fcl' v.v that had caused all
the disturbance.
“Jim Carew”: A scrap between two
Papuan natives isn’t in it for stoush and humor
(for the spectator) compared with a dinkum go
between two Australian gins. The combatants, each
provided with a light club, take their place in the
centre of a ring formed by their expectant tribes-
folk, and commence operations. One gladiator bends
forward from the waist and sticks her head out, and
the other does her best to split it open with the
club. Then it is the other lady’s turn, and this
goes on, whack for whack, until one of the bellig-
erents is laid out. She is then dragged into the
shade and left to recover as best she can. I have
seen a fight like this last for 20 minutes, and it is
a never-ceasing wonder to me that some of the
women are not more seriously hurt. They always
seem to recover. I have never been able to discover
how it is determined which madam shall have first
wallop.
“Norbell” : Seems that voracious eels are
submarining the fledglings of the black duck in Bris-
bane Botanical Gardens. Do eels favor game when
it’s on the menu, or is this an exceptional display
of frightfulness ?
“Haka”: At Marlborough (M.L.) the
other day a cocky barbered his jumbucks with a
horse-elippi.’ig machine. While his missus turned
the handle he hoisted 800 through the porthole.
During smoke-ohs the pair piclced-up, rolled,
classed and baled the clip. Any complaints?
“Tom-Tit”: Is there any authentic record
of a pure white magpie? For three years or moie
there has been such a freak, so the station-hands
declare, flying about on Allanvale, near Great
Western (Vic.). Its form is exactly similar to
that of the ordinary mag., and it mingles freely,
they say, with the common kind.
“Melos”: It’s a wonder that the blacks
didn’t long ago pass out under the ravages of
venereal diseases. Maybe they had some remedies;
I know of one, at least. That was a plant on the
N. S. Wales North Coast—the gigul-gigul. Binghi
chewed the leaves and swallowed the juice.
* * * *
“S.S.”: When the White Horse started
its pumps it gradually reduced the water in the
shaft of the old Johnnie-Come-Lately. The Johnnie
had not been worked for close upon 15 years, and
during all that time Tim the Cheese had remained at
Piebald, sustaining himself precariously by fossicking
up and down the flat, and taking on any old job
that was available within a radius of about three
miles. You could not have tempted him to go
beyond that with an offer of the State Governor’s
position, it would seem. Tim’s life interests circu-
lated around the old Johnnie shaft, in which until
lately the water had remained within 30ft. of the
surface. But the White Horse, actively operating
12-inch lifts, gradually drained the country, and
slowly the waters in the Johnnie, a mile away,
receded until there was 150 ft. of the 200 ft. of shaft
quite dry. The interest Tim the Cheese manifested
in this development was covert but keen. Twice a
day for months he had dropped a plummet into
the deserted mine. Then, finding apparently that
the water was at last getting no lower, he commenced
a curious task. He ran a rough sapling ladder down
the shaft, constructing the lengths on the surface,
and lowering and securing them one after the other.
From the lowermost ladder he sank a hide bag into
the water, and then, at the age of 04, he began
experimenting as a diver. How many times he went
down nobody knows, but eventually he was missing.
A ’party that discovered two lines leading into
the black waters at the end of Tim’s improvised
ladders drew one up. Tim was on the end of it, and
distressingly dead. They drew up the other line and
recovered a hide bag in which was over lloz. of
coarse gold. Later something like 2500 z. of similar
gold was found in an old mercury bottle under Tim’s
bunk. Then a feverish desire to get the rest of the
water out of the Johnnie-Come-Lately seized a small
syndicate. It spent £4OO, and discovered that Tim
by his cheap and primitive method had recovered
ail • the gold worth worrying about —it* had
been hidden in the shaft in a recess in the reef
behind one of the slabs, evidently by gold-stealers,
of whom, no doubt, Tim was one, and probably the
sole survivor. The Johnnie-Come-Lately miners who
had been putting by a little gold as a provision for
their old age were cut off from access to it by the
sudden and dramatic flooding of the mine. It was
Tim’s rotten luck to be snagged under a displaced
“centre” after getting his hands on the last few
ounce 3.
HIS VERDICT.
MARY ANN: “Close up marry!”
TOMMY TARBBUSH: “No feah! Too much plurry cuddle; not nuff nulla-nulla!”
A VICTIM OF DRINK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill Byblow drank a lot of beer.
To drink all day he’d gladly, sit,
But never did a person hear
The dipso, honestly admit
He drank beer for the love of it.
He drank because the day was hot;
He drank because the day was not.
He took a drop the time to pass ;
He guzzled to impede its flight.
With company he took a glass,
Or drank when lonely; or he might
Take to it if his boots were tight.
He even drank to some extent
To prove a temperance argument.
To Phinn’s hotel one summer night
He went alone, and up a spout
He clambered to the roof with quite
Heroic effort. Tearing out
A skylight, though uncommon stout
He battled through. At a.m. four
They found him on the bar-room floor.
Byblow had drunk a giant’s share;
He’d found the kegs of beer, and two
He'd carried up the cellar stair,
And sampled both by boring through.
When charged with stealing half a brew,
“I don’t like drink,” he said, “but may
Take something when it comes my way.”

•Goodwill ( £9500) and other “paper not countea
as assets. .
This used to be a proprietary co., and it
was 13 years old at the time the table
begins. When the public came in, 3oU 11U
pref. shares and 1500 £lO ordinaries (-
in all) were issued in part payment for the
business. Prefs. were limited to 8 p.c., but
in consideration of a further allotment ot
£l2OO the ordinaries agreed to let all shares
rank alike. Now, after eight years, in addi-
tion to paying an almost unbroken 8 p.c.
p.a., the co. has been able to set aside an
amount sufficient to cover goodwill, write ott
certain patent rights it had acquired, and
show the reserve of £689 in the last line.^
No doubt, it has been an anxious time tor
the co. during the last couple of years, with
uncertain supplies and prohibitive price ot
paper and expensive labor; but shareholders
have the satisfaction of knowing that so long
as there is a continuance of anything lihe
“business as usual” goods such as the co.
supplies will be in demand.
This table tells the story in another way :

So in seven years the co.’s liabilities hat e
increased by about £B2OO, and capital
account by £8275. Meantime, £25,271 has
been added to tangible assets. Ihe actual
improvement in seven years, provided tun
depreciation has been allowed, is therefore
about £BBOO.

The £56,336 at 'me foot of the last column
includes fixed deposits £47,070 (£15,837
having been added during the year) and cash
on hand £9248. Meanwhile deposits with
the co. have increased from £90,968 to
£105,115. That is to say, the co. took
another £15,000 on deposit and passed it on
to a bank on fixed deposit. How this sort
of thing can pay The Bulletin doesn’t pro-
fess to know. The only explanation that sug-
gests itself is that the co. borrows from Peter
to pay Paul in case Paul should want his
money. Really neither Peter nor Paul need
worry, though. Apart from deferred deben-
tures, which rank after share capital as well as
after ordinary creditors, the co. owes £106,81 7.
Cash and liquid assets total £65,657. Thus
there is only £41,160 of debt not represented
by liquid assets, and against that there are
loans, premises and a few sundries valued
at £101,028. The creditors are thus very
well protected. The proportion pf cash held
to liabilities is exceptionally large; but
whether it is any larger than it ought to be
depends entirely upon the nature ot the
deposits. Assume that the co. held an aver-
age of £lOO,OOO throughout the year, and
assume further that deferred debentures cost
£5OO, then the deposits cost as an average
about 2\ p.c.; and that looks like call money.
There might be something m that. It SUU
people who usually have some sort of a
current-account balance established a poo ,
they might easily, through the pool, main-
tain a fixed deposit of 50 or a hundred
thousand, because it could scarcely ever
happen that the uninvested money of all ot
them would be low at the same time. ‘°"
the banks would look at it is another matter.
It isn’t at all certain that the Austral
Malay will get the Trong dredge for its new
flotation. Trong may take over the Lang-
suan option of 160 acres; anyway, it is clear
that the co. is putting itself m its best
possible position for some purpose.
Birthday Tunnel, Berringa (Vic.), has
been sold up after gasping on the call-list
for the best part of a decade. Its last des-
perate resort was to get an advance from
tho Government to test the Kangaroo reef.
Owing to the high price of mining material,
the plant and the scrap-iron realised suffi-
cient to repay the State and give shaie-
holders a small liquidation div.
* * *
Things are only joyful in spots for John
Bull capitalist. Kamunting, the Malayan
tin-show which he owns in partnership with

“Hannibal”: The heaviest lot of bullocks
ever put through a Queensland meat works
were handled some weeks ago at Alligator
Creek, Townsville. There were 628 in the
mob, and the average dressed weight was
0091 b. They had been driven 300 miles to
Winton, held up there by the late railway
strike for three weeks, and then trucked
370 miles to Townsville. Sid Kidman owned
them.

“F.”: The other morning I noticed that
we had a new brown earthenware teapot.
“Ha,” I remarked with a sneer, “more Jap-
anese rubbish, I s’pose. How much?” “A
shilling,” replied Araminta, “but I don t
think it’s Japanese.” “Soon tell,” I said,
and had a look at the maker’s mark under-
neath. Incredible as it may seem, the pot
was made in Australia, and was marked
“leadless glaze”—a good, cheap, substantial
article. Yet, regarding the Victorian co.
which produces this particular ware, a shop-
man told Araminta only a day or two later
that the concern didn’t deserve to succeed,
because it refused to sell its goods at a fair
price. The price lie meant, of course, was
the wholesale. If he were a wise shopman
he would thank God that Australian goods
are comparatively dear. If they weren’t his
customers would be coming in for two-
penn’orth of butter or a ha’p’orth of mar-
garine.

“Breeder” : “Eloc’s” self-congratulation (B.
20/12/T7) as a prophet in regard to the
effects of Justice Higgins’s station-hands
award, displays an intimacy with pastoral
matters which will surprise some of the old
’uns. But the prophet doesn’t seem to have a
very clear idea of the causes which lead up
to a good lambing percentage. Last year’s
high rates were due, not to anything his
Honor did or didn’t, but (1) to the flourish-
ing condition of the breeding sheep during
the mating season in the early summer ot
1916-17, whereby a high rate of impregna-
tion was obtained, which is obviously the
foundation upon which the result rests ; (-0
to an abundance of feed during tli e subse-
quent lambing season, producing the neces-
sary milk to sustain the born lambs; (3) to
suitable weather at that time. Cold, wet
weather will kill new-born lambs by the
hundred. Those of us who lambed in April,
1917. in mild warm weather following good
March rains, averaged well up towards the
century and without excessive labor; while
neighbors who lambed in May, in incessant
rain, sustained high losses of grown sheep as
well as of lambs, despite the “more atten-
tion” necessary in the circumstances.
“Eloc’s” predictions, especially that one re-
lating to next year, are about as well-
founded as the Pearson’s Weekly yarn
about the versifying bushies. He must, have
a quaint estimate of human nature, if he has
been under the impression that pastoralists
have poor lambings on purpose.
* * * *
“Old Salt”: Victoria’s new shipyard man-
ager, Bomphrey, late of Thorneycroft’s, of
Southampton, and Vickers and Son, of Bar-
row, reached Australia with the expiring days
of the year, and rushed to Melbourne, intent
on starting work on Wednesday morning
early. I wish him luck, and hope he will
continue full of energy. He will need it.
Under the nerveless regime of the Peacocks
the Williamstown State shipyard lias become
worse than a ghastly joke. On the main
slipway is the dredge Lady Stanley, which
has been ready for launching for many
months and is still ready. But for some
.obscure reason —probably because there isn’t
enough moisture to float her —there she re-
mains. Lying about the yard are tons of
iron and steel girders, bars, plates and stacks
of timber and woodwork, mostly exposed to
the weather, which naturally improves
girders and plates, to say nothing of dressed
timber. Spare propellers, crank-shafts, etc.
—which can be picked up for a song any-
where —lie about casually, just as a child
drops its toys. Yes, Bomphrey will need all
his vim.
* * * . *
N. S. Wales has in these days a law which
provides for the preparation of a complete
record of all house and land property in the
State, with the value thereof; and this
record is to be used as the basis for munici-
pal rating, for stamp duty, for compensation
in the event of resumption and for other pur-
poses. The owner may be called upon for
particulars—as a matter of fact, a large
batch of “owner’s returns” have lately been
sent out —but an official inspection will be
made, and thereon a valuation will be pre-
pared. If the owner (who will be told what
it is) doesn’t like it, he can object, where-
upon the valuation will be further investi-
gated; “otherwise the official valuation will
be entered on the valuation roll and cannot
be questioned.” When the job has been done
the owner must keep the Valuer-General
advised of alterations, either additions or
removals; and the purchase of freeholds or
leaseholds has also to be notified. It will be
a convenience, no doubt, to have a complete
roll, and the data will help in arriving at a
value; but the valuation roll obviously won’t
be good evidence of market value except at
the moment the entry was made. If Courts
and others don’t clearly recognise this, the
roll may do harm as well as good.
* * * *
“McNorth”: I nominate the Hann Shire
(N.Q.) as the largest in Australia. Its
headquarters are at Maytown, on the once-
famous Palmer Goldfield —now merely . a
collection of disused shafts and crumbling
poppet-legs. The shire takes in the Cape
York Peninsula and most of the islands of
Torres Strait right across to Saibai, a couple
of miles off the Papuan coast. Distances
are so great and transit so difficult that the
Hann civic dads are often a long time dis-
covering their neighbors. I have been here
on Cape York for over six years, but it was
only the other day that Maytown found it
out and sent in a bill for rates. I don’t
mind paying, but I’m sending in a complaint
about the state of the culverts _and street-
lighting up here to see if the 500-mile-dis-
tant Council understands sarcasm.
The women have scored all right. As soon
as the war started a thousand seedy gamps
waved over Australia and there was a wild
yell to dose the pubs in order to save money
and win the war. Now even the fluff mer-
chants are telling the papers that it was “a
criminal shame” the way the women came
in before and during the holidays and
“bought finery”; and the jewellers tell the
same story—it wasn’t good goods they sold
by the barrow-load, but stuff that looked a
lot for the money. Still, the woman will pay
in the end, as usual. Three-fourths of this
splash is on borrowed money ; and the bill
for interest and principal will come in pre-
sently. The best thing said about Australia
lately was the report of a mercer on his
Christmas trade. His business is, in ordi-
nary times, mostly with young men. .. “This
season,” he said, “things were rotten.”
* * * *
Though war-loan money is being gaily
splashed, it hasn’t taken the place of the
Holman Government’s borrowed quids in
N. S. Wales. In 1913 the new buildings
erected in the bloated city and its suburbs
cost £3,371,617. Last year the total was
down to £3,595,992, and it wouldn’t have
been that much if owners hadn’t been com-
mitted to contracts. Of all the 50 or so
suburbs Randwick had the greatest number
of new buildings, 428; its neighbor Waver-
ley was close up with 304 —-both figures fur-
ther proof of the call of the curling surf, for
Randwick takes in Coogee and Waverley
holds on to Bondi. It is Mosman, however,
that lifts its nose highest, Whereas the
average cost of the 5295 buildings in the
suburbs last year was £607, the average for
the 91 in Mosman was £1660. The most
cheerful circumstance, if there is any cheer-
ful circumstance at all about- the further
bloating of what was too bloated already,
was that the people are going further out
into the clean air. Overcrowded old Red-
fern reported only two new buildings, Pad-
dington 3, and Glebe half a dozen.
* * * *
“Edo” : Kalgoorlie and Boulder toilers are
bitterly lamenting Labor’s popular act of
leaping in the dark and landing in the bog.
Agitators, mostly of anti-conscription and
I.W.W. type, spurred the crowd on to demand
higher wages, but omitted to point out that
while the price of gold has remained station-
ary, all costs have soared kite-high, so that
the present is the very worst time to. come
for a rise in wages in this particular indus-
try. One result is that most Golden Mile
properties have shortened hands, while a
couple of others talk of closing down till the
war is over. It has its humorous side.
During the Referendum campaign the antis,
including Hugh Mahon, yapped that there
wasn’t enough man power left in the coun-
try to keep the industries going. Next day
he received a deputation representing, i
said, some hundreds, who requested him to
find them work!
* * * *
“Joyce” i For some time the Bank of N. S.
Wales has been supplying cheque-forms to
public schools with a view to making com-
mercial instruction more realistic. The goods
are identical with the genuine article, except
that they have “Specimen Form printed
across them. One kid, either for a Doke or
through carelessness —probably the former
—got away with a cheque for £o
payable to bearer, and dropped it in
the y street. It was subsequently picked up
by a park prospector, presented for payment
at a certain branch, and it took the whole
staff including the office-cleaner, to persuade
the good citizen that the spinnaker was
salted. #
AVE GLADIATRIX!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The sandals this season are so attractive that,
one would be tempted to buy even if they served no
practical purpose. Some, coming well up the back
of the leg and lacing in front with brigntly -colored
tapes, are modelled on the lines of a Koman gladi-
ator’s shoe.’’
Ah, Lalage, in ages gone,
When flame was clothed in flesh,
1 sat, a young centurion,
With you to watch the mesh
Of ltetiarius strive to check
The spear, sped clean and true,
Lest be should feel upon his neck
The gladiator’s shoe.
Ah, Lalage, those days are sped;
I now must play the part
Of him whose feet too late have fled
To save his stricken heart.
The net surrounds me ; hope is past;
No more you need pursue:
Upon my neck descends at last
Your gladiator’s shoe!
VICTORIA.
SANDALWOOD.
FRUGAL McDOUGAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At A. McDougal’s there’d been ructions
McDougal, frugal soul, had made
Such drastic, win-the-war reductions
In rations, that a sudden raid
Descended on him in the stable,
And all the angry workers swore
They’d have a really sumptuous table,
Or work for Angus never more.
Reluctantly the boss conceded
Two rashers with an egg for tea,
Which was the meat the toilers needed. '
“ ’Tis sair extravagant,” said he.
Old Angus sliced them, in the morning,
Two rashers each, cut very fine,
And gave the cook a solemn warning:
“Mon, fry them weel —the lard is mine!
The men came in with frightened faces
That evening at the stroke of five.
The harvester hooked Stringer s braces
And Stringer was no more alive!
McDougal gasped in horror holy.
“The Lord He giveth,” said the man,
“The Lord He tak’s awa’!” And slowly
He forked two rashers from the pan.

You save three ways when you roof with “Adamax”
in place of iron.
You Save in First Cost
You Save in Steamer Freight
You Save in Railage.
But even at this great saving “Adamax” is a Better
Roof than Iron can ever hope to be.
"ADAMAX” is the best Roofing that
money can buy, and here is undoubted
proof of the fact.
In March last the N.S.W. Railway
Commissioners accepted our tender for
the supply of “AD AM AX” ROOF-
ING and Dampcourse for the year
1917-18.
The WEST AUSTRALIAN GOV-
ERNMENT, after exhaustive tests and
analyses, decided upon “ADAMAX ”
Roofing for their large Wynham
Freezing Works.
The MURRUMBIDGEE IRRIGA-
TION COMMISSION, N.S.W.,
adopted “ADAMAX” ROOFING in
June last for their No. 1 Leeton Canning
Factory. In November, “Adamax”was
again accepted for their second contract
for subsidiary buildings.
Over 20,000 sq. yards of “Adamax” is
being used in these last two contracts.
ANOTHER BIG CONTRACT secured by “AD AM AX” was the supplying of 42,000 sq. yards to the
South Australian Wheat Board in July last.
These Concerns wanted the Best . They selected “ADAMAX” Asphaltum Roofing
after inviting tenders and having the most exhaustive tests. . That fact alone should convince you of its
superiority in every roofing essential.
Consider These Facts About
"Adamax” Asphaltum Roofing.
It has no effect on drinking-water. Does not “pit” with salt air.
Stands Sulphur and Ammonia fumes. Resists Acids and Fire.
Is practically free from sweating.
“Adamax” can be used on a roof with very low pitch.
It is 12-14 degrees cooler than iron, and practically soundproof.
The sterling qualities of “Adamax” Roofing will also be found in—
“Adamax” Damp course
“Adamax” SarKing Felt
“Adamax” Building Paper
“Adamax” Cement Solution
“Adamax” Roofing Paint.

LOGICAL DYSPEPSIA TREATMENT.
IMPORTANCE OF ELIMINATING
ACIDITY AND FOOD
FERMENTATION.
During the last two or three years reports
have frequenty appeared in the press con-
< the remarkable value of bisurated
1 ia as an antacid ; and its ability to
ix ■ most forms of digestive and stomach
trouble arising from acidity and fermentation
has often been demonstrated. Until re-
cently-chemists could supply bisurated mag-
nesia in powder form only, half a teaspoon-
ful of which, taken in a little water after
meals, almost instantly stops all fermenta-
tion and neutralises acid, but sufferers will
be glad to learn that they can now obtain
this excellent remedy in the form of 5-grain
compressed tablets, two of which are equiva-
lent to half a teaspoonful of the original
powder. These new tablets of bisurated
magnesia can now be obtained of chemists
everywhere, in handy pocket flasks contain-
ing 60 and 150 tablets respectively, and it is
certain that they will prove as popular and
as efficacious as the original powder form of
bisurated magnesia, which of course is still
obtainable.-—Advt.

AT HOYT’S THEATRES.
The opening up of the New Year with a new releasing policy
proves one thing—that Hoyt’s are determined to give their
patrons the best entertainment available in Motion Pictures,
and when they- selected Paramount and Artcraft productions
exclusively for their Sydney and Melbourne Houses, it was like
acknowledging their superiority over all other makes of
pictures.
Paramount-Artcraft stories are wonderfully human interpreta-
tions of life in its various phases, w 7 ith such artists a's MARY
PICKFORD, PAULINE FREDERICK, MARGUERITE CLARK,
DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS, WM. S. HART, BILLIE BURKE,
GERALDINE FARRAR, VIVIAN MARTIN, SESSUE HAYA-
KAWA, FATTY ARBUCKLE, JACK PICKFORD, LOUISE
HUFF and a hundred other great stars of the film world, to
bring laughter and tears with their humor and heart-throbs in
stories by the greatest literary and dramatic writers of the age.
If your nearest theatre is not showing: Paramount Pictures, you are not getting all you ought to get. Let the
manager understand that you would like to see Paramount Pictures. He will when he knows his
patrons are concerned about what he shows, and you will get what is your right—the very
best entertainment for your money.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Hughes Government and its follow-
ing in the Legislature stood pledged as
deeply as men ever were in this world to a
certain course of action if Australia refused
to sanction Conscription. The moment they
were confronted with the job of making
good they began to waver. Left to himself
Hughes would probably have treated his
undertaking with indifference, gulped down
all the dirty water and stayed on his perch.
But the caucus had a haunting suspicion
that the electors ought to be given some sort
of dope; and so it happened that Hughes,
being assured that he had the “confi-
dence” of the caucus, and being in-
structed to save the Empire by saving
the party bacon, went through the
mockery of resigning on Monday, form-
ing the old Ministry into a new Ministry
on Tuesday, and resuming the old busi-
ness of selling gold-bricks at the old address
on Wednesday. So it all boils down to this
—that the Commonwealth has a Ministry
which it had been assured it would not have
unless it did something which it refused to
do.
FINDING AN EXCUSE.
“Well, I’ll let you put your arm round me
just this time, because —because you’re
going to the war and might get it blown
off.”
During the procession round the tart-shop
the S. M. Herald solemnly warned the
nation that anybody who made unmannerly
remarks about Hughes when the proceedings
terminated would be “playing the game of
Germany.” That, of course, is because
Hughes has “the King’s Commission.” Well,
Ryan of Queensland has the King’s Com-
mission, too; so if the Herald makes any
more unpleasant remarks about Ryan we
shall have to come to the unwilling conclu-
sion that the Herald has gone over to the
enemy.
Pearce made a dreadful mistake last week.
Attacked by J. D. Fitzgerald over the Cen-
sorship he declared that there wasn’t any
such thing as political censorship, and as
for other matters he challenged his adver-
saries to produce a single instance in which
war pews censored in England had been
expunged in Australia. That challenge was
the blunder-—Sydney Sun fell upon him
with one instance and promised a battalion
if he wanted them. Now, in the matter of
political censorship, The Bulletin is wait-
ing for Pearce to challenge it to produce
proof that this paper wasn’t prevented from
suggesting that somebody should take his
(Pearce’s) place as Minister for Defence.
The proof is waiting for him any day he likes
to issue the challenge.
Henderson, leader of the Labor party,
whom Lloyd George consulted before he
issued the latest peace terms, has put the
matter of post-war relations with Germany
more plainly even than the Prime Minister.
“We desire,” he said, “the fullest resumption
of international intercourse, and the repudia-
tion of all attempts at economic war.” There
is only one thing on which we can rely for
the protection of our industries from fiercer
competition even than they had before, and
LOOKING FORWARD.
CONSOLATORY ASS : “Well! Well! Beastly
things WILL happen, ye know.”
ENRAGED AND HEATED MOTORIST: “They
will!”
that thing is a high tariff. The question we
have to answer is whether we are going with
a high tariff to help ourselves to pay our
war debt or with a low tariff help the Ger-
man to pay the debt he has incurred in kill-
ing our sons and brothers.
The S. M. Herald may not be so far
wrong in suggesting that whoever now
speaks badly of Hughes will be doing Ger-
many’s work. For it certainly is true that
so long as Hughes remains Prime Minister
and the broken pledge is remembered against
him, so long is recruiting likely to be seri-
ously prejudiced.
Defence Minister Pearce last week de-
fended the censorship,, particularly against
certain mild allegations made by J. D. Fitz-
gerald k of Sydney. At the end of the argu-
ment all the public understood was that one
side was saying that the other was wrong.
Now, if Pearce is genuinely anxious that the
community should know the truth about the
censorship and the work it performs, there’is
an easy way of spreading the light. Let him
withdraw the regulation which keeps The
Bulletin from printing the instructions
issued by the Censor’s office. Then the
people will know, more or less, to what
extent ard on what subjects they can trust
the information (etc.) given to them in the
press, and what dependence they can place
upon the newspapers’ comments.
The Bulletin has little sympathy to
spare for the Labor party in relation to
Hughes. Holman stated the fact quite
plainly: “I have long known that Mr.
Hughes’s pledged word was utterly worth-
less.” - Holman knew no more and no less
than the rest of the Labor party. But the
party didn’t spurn Hughes on that account.
Instead, it regarded him as a valuable asset.
And there you have the rottenness to which
party has brought our politics. Hughes
is out of the party to-day. But there are
still in that party and in other parties men
who are known to be liars and simfffers and
twisters and tricksters, and who are valued
by the parties for the possession of these
qualities.
“Unpontius Pilot” pricks the card :—-
Of course you’ve heard that Ryan is to be next
Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, in which event
this is nearly how the reshuffle will go. Theodore is
to be Premier, Hunter having gone to England.
Assistant-Minister Fihelly is to be Home Secretary
in place of Huxham; Hardacre will be allowed to
join Huxham in retirement. Speaker McCormack
has made up his mind to get out of the Chair, and
he is sure of one of the four vacant portfolios—pro-
bably Works. Tom Jones, of Foggitt, Jones and
Co., will get the Agriculture Department. The other
jobs will Ire filled from the ruck, Gillies and Cooper
being likely. Huxham or Hardacre may get the
Speakership. Of course, in the event of Page resign-
ing his seat in the Reps, in favor of Ryan, he would
almost certainly be given a portfolio in the State
House.
You never lift off the cover and look into
the doings of Government departments with-
out seeing deplorable mismanagement—
mostly because it is only once in 20 times
that a business-man gets into Parliament;
and when he does fluke into Parliament he
vesry rarely reaches office. S. Australia
lately looked into its Government land pur-
chases. When they want land, the Commis-
sion reports, they have a way of saying so
to a land-agent, and instructing him to pick
up some to suit requirements; “but you will
look to the vendors for your remuneration.”
This at once makes him the agent of the
vendors, whoever they may turn out to be:
it relieves him of the moral responsibility of
keeping secret the purchaser’s name, and the
inquiry abundantly proved, what hardly
wanted proving, that even with the most
honest of men prices soar astonishingly when
the Government is the buyer.
Bowser is beginning his labors as Pre-
mier of Victoria by doing the obvious thing,
which is mostly the
hardest thing for the
politician to do, because
he lives mainly on flam
and make-believe. Gipps-
land, which in the early
days of the war was the
scene of a tremendous
Parliamentary excursion,
proposes to send 100 of
its leading whiskers to
Melbourne to interview
the Government on vari-
ous matters. As such a
trip would cost some-
body even more than the
previous excursion did,
Bowser has intimated
that he is going to take a
couple of Ministers and
go down to Gippsland himself, in a quiet
and economical way, to hear what the
100 whiskers have to say. And he will be
obliged if, for the rest of the time, they will
go on with their work. •
From the Gallery:—
More honest people are grieving over Willie Watt
than any of the others. If he had held to his first
expressed intention of honoring the pledge, he would
have increased his chances of ultimately climbing
into the principal part. He enjoys a certain prestige
with the Nationalists, and it only needed a show of
honesty at a critical time to stiffen his reputation
with the influential section of Liberals who cannot
think of Hughes's conduct without holding their nose.
It was an exquisite opportunity for Watt, with the
possibility of enough haloes to set him up as a
hatter in the heavenly regions. To give, him his
due, he hesitated for some hours, while his office-
hungry colleagues danced about him in nervous
anxiety, and grovelled to him to respect the sacred
principle of Cabinet solidarity. Watt eventually fell
away, but he is at least entitled to a little credit
for having some compunction about the matter. The
readiness of the others to resume their jobs was
pathetic in the cases of Forrest and Glynn, but only
typical of men like Pearce, Jensen and Russell.
Nothing more could be expected from this precious
trio of dull invertebrates.
The first returns under the Federal war-
time profits tax were due last week, and
nobody in the wide world knows whether
the wretched thing will produce one pound
or five. According to statements made by
men who say they have been sounding mem-
bers, very few of those who voted for the
bills approved of them; which shows what
an enemy to democracy party government
is. One thing is certain: the measure is
putting a brake on industry in Australia.
To increase profit nearly everybody has to
risk something, with no certainty that the
extra profit will accrue; and if the State
collars half or three-quarters of it if it is
made, Private Enterprise naturally says that
it isn’t good enough to take the risk.
What is this nonsense about Hughes’s
police not being needed? Beech worth (Vic.)
Gaol has only one prisoner to four officers,
and there are dozens empty or nearly empty
all over the country.
At the root of the whole trouble with
regard to the utterly unsatisfactory war-
time profits tax lies the failure of the
Federal Government to distinguish between
the position in England and in Australia.
England didn’t want new industries started ;
Australia did- —with shipping scarce it was
a question of (1) starting new industries
here, (2) going without things or (3) pur-
chasing from Japan and other markets
AS YOU WERE.

handier than Europe. We ought, of
course, to have done everything pos-
sible to encourage new local indus-
tries and the extension of existing busi-
nesses. The war-time profits puzzle says, in
effect, “If you do, you’ll take all the risk,
and we’ll take three-quarters of the profit.”
Health-Minister Downward is going to
try to do something which will put a halo
on the new Vic. Administration, if it comes
off. For some time spasmodic agitations
have been conducted, without the slightest
success, to get baby clinics established by
the Government. Now, perhaps noticing
that a few persistent people are still
attempting to wake the State conscience,
Downward has been talking the matter over
with Dr. Robertson, chairman of the Board
of Health, and it is quite likely that some-
thing may be done—there may even be as
many as 50 clinics, with a doctor and nurse
at each, to advise mother as to baby’s con-
dition. If Bowser can only get in a few
more reforms like this before the next crisis,
he will be doing pretty well for himself in
the eyes of a lot of people.
The completion of the East-West railway
puts the 4ft. °Jin. ahead of the sft. 3in. in
the race of the gauges: there are now 5455
miles of the one and 5011 of the other,
exclusive of a scrap or two of private lines.
But the two together don't represent half-
of the total railway mileage of the Common-
wealth ; and the bill for unification is being
piled higher, because Queensland continues
to build nothing wider than 3ft. 6in., and
pven the Commonwealth is spending an
extravagant sum on the same gauge in the
Northern Territory.
PROMETHEUS UNBOUND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The party has produced no rival to Mr. Hughes.”
He stands alone, unchallenged and supreme,
The one, the only, the triumphant Bill!
The winds his fame to hill and valley scream ;
And curving waves with admiration spill
Applause upon the shore. His laurels glow,
Fresh washed and green with all a party’s tears,
The brighter for the loud emphatic No
That roared defeat about his trembling ears.
Tremendously ho talked; and still the sound
Of variegated language sweeps and sways
The large astonished landscape round and round
Through all the tangles of the public maze.
On and still on! Hear him excuse, explain.
The mouthpiece of the party and its jaw,
He fills the arid wastes with wordy rain
Till rival mouths are closed in silent awe.
What of that pledge he gave at Bendigo?
Shall mere words hold him from high leadership?
Shall one hot breath of language lay him low
And dash the cup of office he would sip
From his hard-gripping fingers? Never yet
Did such a barrier stay him from his goal!
Sorrow remembers, wisdom should forget;
A dead pledge must not thwart a living soul.
Alone he stands unchallenged and elate!
What need that statesman skill be here employed
Against the pale, place-hungry souls that wait,
By their late referendum triumph buoyed
To some high hope of loaves and little fishes!
Out on the traitors ! Each pledge we recall!
Shall mere dull truth permit the office dishes
Full-charged with pickings to such mouths to fall?

COMSTOCK’S “DEAD-SHOT” WORM
PELLETS.
A SAFE, SURE, AND RELIABLE SPECIFIC FOR
THE ERADICATION OF WORMS IN CHILDREN
AND ADULTS.
The general symptoms of worms are a
tendency to pick the nose and a sensation of
itching in the anus. Other symptoms are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, and grind-
ing the teeth, sudden starting out of sleep as
if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, per-
verted vision, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children, and symptoms resembling
water in the head have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
The long round or stomach worm' is the
commonest kind of worm from which man-
kind suffers, and is of a light, transparent
color, resembling the ordinary ground worm,
except that the extremities are more sharply
pointed than the ground worm.
Young people are more subject to these
worms than middle-aged or elderly people.
They live in the bowels, and sometimes make
their way into the stomach and throat, caus-
ing sickness, vomiting and choking. Gener-
ally one or two would be the most a person
would be afflicted with, but sometimes a
much larger number is met with. The length
varies from four to eight inches, but young
ones an inch to two inches long are also
found. The first thing to do is to rid the
system of the worms, and Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according to
directions, are an effective remedy for the
thorough eradication of the long round or
stomach worm—the common enemy of the
child, the youth, the middle-aged and aged.
A light, nourishing diet, out-of-door exercise,
and. if possible, a change of air, will greatly
improve the general health.
Threadworms or pinworms are of very
common occurrence in children. They are
very small, from one-sixth of an inch to half-
an-inch in length, and resemble cotton
thread—they are sometimes called seat
worms, and reside in the lower bowels. The
chief symptom of this worm is severe local
itching, restlessness and irritability, and a
frequent desire to urinate, picking at the
nose; loss of appetite and anaemia are also
observed. To get rid of the worms and their
eggs their nests also must be removed, and
that requires a specific remedy. Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets, taken according
to directions, on an empty stomach, followed
by a dose of opening medicine, will succeed
where others fail.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are packed with full directions, and
are for sale by chemists and stores
generally at 3s. 6d. per packet, or six
packets for 205., and if unable to obtain
locally will be mailed post free on receipt of
price. Prepared only by The W. H. Comstock

NEGLECT
1 he healthy man or woman is usually the most careless,
and fails to observe the little indications of coming
trouble. However healthy persons may be, they need
to watch themselves, because a little indigestible food or a little too much food or drink upsets the
whole digestive machine, and unless Nature receives some assistance trouble is certain to follow;
fiist, perhaps, by a common bilious attack, and then other serious digestive troubles. The sensible
man or woman, however, keeps a sharp eye on the little signs of ill-health and takes a remedy like
Di. Moises Indian Root Pills to aid digestion and help Nature over some obstruction caused by
too much food or drink. There is no better remedy for this purpose in this or any other country,
and their ever-increasing use by all classes of the community bears testimony to their high efficiency.
The best advice that can be given is to always have a bottle of these pills at hand, and when the
hist indication of trouble appears in the form of Constipation, take a dose. The result is certain
to be effective, and in a simple manner the system is put right again. No remedy at any price is
better or more carefully prepared than Dr. Morse’S Indian Root Pills. They are the
Standard Remedy of thousands; used in the-city, town and country with equally good results, and
sold at a price within the reach of all.

WHY PHYSICIANS PRESCRIBE
BITRO-PHOSPHATE FOR
WEAK NERVES.
FRENCH SPECIALISTS CLAIM THIS
ORGANIC PHOSPHATE IS ACTUALLY
CONVERTED INTO LIVING NERVE
TISSUE.
The rapid increase in the use by physicians
and nerve specialists of the organic nerve-
building and easily assimilated phosphate
known among druggists as bitro-phosphate,
is due almost entirely to the remarkably
favorable results obtained by specialists of
world-wide fame and reputation. It is there-
fore only logical that doctors throughout
the country should be urged wherever possi-
ble to prescribe bitro-phosphate instead of
narcotic or stimulant habit-forming drugs or
alcoholic preparations in the treatment of
nervousness, neurasthenia, sleeplessness,
nervous debility, lack of energy, mental
depression, etc.
Being a food which, according to Rohm
and other French authorities, is actually
assimilated and converted into living nerve
tissue, bitro-phosphate, which is readily
obtainable of any chemist in the form of
5-grain tablets, is strongly recommended for
the use, not only of those who suffer as in-
dicated above, but also to those who wish to
increase their nerve strength, vim, vigor,
vitality and powers of endurance. It is
especially valuable to aviators, motorists,
gunners and men in the various branches of
the' army and navy, where strong, steady
nerves are of vital importance. Cut out
drugs and alcoholic stimulants. Take one
5-grain tablet of bitro-phosphate wdth each
meal and note how quickly your entire being
begins to overflow with that vim, vigor and
vitality which make life truly worth living.

NOTIONS
“Mujik”: Just so long as tlie totalisator
is contemplated as ah instrument for yielding
revenue to the State will it be looked at the wrong
way and muddle will prevail in its working. It the
machine is merely this there is little to be said tor
it, since the same results could be obtained by the
State dipping' into Mo’s bag. There is no moral or
practical difference between a State revenue of, sav,
£lOO,OOO from duty stamps on betting tickets and
the same amount obtained by way of a tax on the
turnover of the machine. When people saj 1 the
machine is a failure on N.S.W. courses, do they mean
that if twice or three times the money went through
it would be a “success” simply because the State
revenue would be increased? The truth is that the
“State revenue” aspect of this matter has been given
absurd importance, and that the only argument by
which the totalisator can be justified has lu-en obscured.
That argument is that the machine is a rational
betting-system and a reasonable substitute for a
crowd of idlers who by hanging on the turf derive
a parasitical living from the public. If this conten-
tion is wrong then the machine is an excrescence. If
it is right, then Mo should receive the boot. To
maintain both is merely to drain , the public more
than before and make farce of the proceedings
whether the totalisator investments are large or
small. *
“Quill”: That three-dividend system on
the N. S. Wales totalisator is right enough in a way.
It is also a certain method of not getting the custom
of the man who is out to win. And on any race-
course in N. S. Wales this is the man with the money
that talks. When the Tote Bill was before the
Legislature I suggested that the right lines to follow
were these. Give Ike notice to quit. When he had
gone, and not before, be ready with a double-
barrelled tote system, one machine paying on winners
only, the other on placed horses, a single dividend
being calculated on the three. To suppose that men
who really bet are goinc to nut a heavy dollop on a
horse and get a cut from only 50 per -cent, of the
totalisator investment is absurd. They simply won t
do it. A winner tote with £1 tickets and a place
tote at 10s. would fill the bill and the hole caused
by the evaporation of McShortodds. The cheapen-
ing of the thing, combined with the maintenance of
the ring, looks like a crude dodge to miss the bull’s-
eye.

Someone or other seems anxious that the
pony-race promoter shall not go short in wartime.
Queensland Turf Club received a telegram from the
Defence Department the other day that the Minister
had granted John Wren three extra days racing
between then and March 2 at Albion Park, and direct-
ing the Club to fix the dates. Of course the Club
promptlv made a protest against the policy which
curtailed its own racing days and allowed Wren
more days. And there the matter stood last week.
It is time this libera] treatment of Wren was ex-
plained by the Defence Department. Otherwise
people will begin to explain it for themselves.
“MacPhraiser” : Who says horse-racing is
not being restricted ? It is true that down about the
city they only have a couple of meetings a week and
somewhere about 14 events on the programme. But
at Sunny Corner, where they have race-meetings as
often as’ once every year and the prize list runs up
to as much as a tenner, not including the bridle
for the opening handicap, they had to abandon their
annual meeting the other day because the stern
Win-the-W'ar Department refused permission for the
meeting to Tie held.
* * * *
There was more curtailment of sport in
Sydney last week. Rain fell in large lumps from
Thursday to Saturday, with the result that, unless
thev ran the Flying Handicap in boats and fitted the
remaining nags with sails, it was. no good thinking
about giving the thoroughbred a bit more encomage-
ment. As these schemes were considered impractic-
able the two Sydney race meetings arranged tor
Saturday were postponed to the current week.
One of the big six-furlongs events of the
vear will be run at Randwick -on Saturday—the
A J.C. Challenge Stakes. Anniversary Handicap the
following week. Epsom Handicap winner Panacre,
who was up in the front line for three parts of the
journey in the Villiers Mile on December 22, came
into the betting with a run last week, and was a
dead-heat with Poitrina when the odds were men-
tioned. An apparently open race, but La Steppe and
Panacre may be thereabouts. Old Ulva’s Isle lias
been most talked about for the Anniversary, mainly
because he has seemed to be growing younger lately
on the track. Perhaps something with a Jess pro-
longed past may be noticed first. If so, it may he
the improving Kennaquhair.

Phil Glenister, who. has a first-rate claim
to the title of oldest active N.S.W. sportsman, passed
the 80th milestone the other day. He was one of the
participants in the novel wager of 1000 to eight
drinks which was made by bookie W. Slack against
Crovdon and Nimblefoot winning the Metrop. and
Melbourne Cup double of 1870. The double came
off; and although W. Craig, who took the bet, died
before the Cup was run, whereby the wager was made
null, Slack paid £5OO to the family. The eight
drinks were also consumed, and Glenister is the only
one left of those who shared them. Phil Glenister
has for 51 years been a member of Tattersall’s Club
(Sydney) ; and in the boxing boom days he was
stake-holder in many of the big fights.

The £3150 given for Thana is not the
highest figure a buyer ha % gone when he wanted a
mare. Golden Slipper cost half as much again and
was worth a lot less. But it shows that there is
a plucky man on the premises. Of course lhana
mar yet win a race or two and go to the stud with
a bit in hand, so to speak. If she doesn t then
she will be an even bigger investment, tor oats
and training cost money. The interesting point
about her will be whether she does any good in the
paddock. The mare particularly successful on the
turf is seldom a success in the other place. in
nearly every case she leaves her vitality benind,
though the success of nags bred from the progeny o
such a mare, seem to show that there is a screw
loose somewhere in this theory. American expel 1-
ence is said to show that when a mare taken from
a successful racing career is spelled and well fee
for a year before the nuptials, the output can bt
expected to do better than if she had been rushed
into tile business of maternity. A buyer with
enough cash to pay over £ 3000 for a mare ought
to have enough to try this scheme m Australia.
The sale of Sol Green’s stud at Shipley
(Vic.) brought in i 11,245 guineas, which is probably
a good deal less than Sol expected. Ihe yearlings
sold well. Sam Hordern, of Sydney, was ready
with a thousand for a Comedy King-Crossi Battei.
colt, and half a dozen other youngsters netted over
41500 a-piece. But there was no great rush for
the mares. Comedy King was exchange' '*
guineas offered by Norman Falluner, and takes the
place of Land of Song at Pranlip. In view; of the
thumping advt. this stallion has been given by
Biplane, a bigger wad may have been expected,
but it Was a good price to get, all the same. And
White Star was a good horse to get for 4,2300.
“Kola”: When I saw Comedy King
knocked down to Norman Falkiner, of Pranjip T’ark,
Murchison (Vic.), last week, it recalled to me Aiarat
of 60 years ago. The diggings were then in full
sw j n o\ We had a farm down near Mortlake, and I
used” to drive the team up with oats and wheat.
Old Frank Falkiner kept a produce store then at the
Pond, a few miles south of Ararat, in the heart of
the diggings. It was called a “produce store, but
vou could buy almost anything there. I bought
sugar, tea and tobacco. Falkiner was. a shrewd old
chap, but popular talk made his missus the chief
wheel in the machine. They kept the store till the
diggings petered right out. Then, ln the late
’sixties, thev sold out, and went up to N.S.W. to
buy a station. And now Norman gives i 300 guineas
for a nag! * * *
“Yarra Ren”: This economy business is
being taken too seriously. It s not a couple of years
ago since Trafalgar fetched 7500 guineas. And to-
day-to-day nobody can be found to give more than
6000 guineas 'for a champion like Tressady, anrt
Comedy King could command no more than < 300
guineas a few clays ago. #
Another feather in the hat of the Dunlop
people is beginning to make that article resemble a
Red Indian head-dress. Recently Boyd Edkifts drove
a Dunloped ear from Brisbane to Sydney in 26 hours
S minutes, which completed a trio ot records held b.v
Ihe Australian tyre for the stretches between capitals
pom Adelaide to Brisbane. The previous runs from
Melbourne to Sydney and from Melbourne to Adel
aide by Edkins and Murray Aunger respectively beat
each railway express for the distance. The
miles from ’ Adelaide to Brisbane have now been
motored in 57 hours 52 minutes. #
“Dormant”: Desert Gold could nearly
win at Buninyong (Vic.), anyway. They startei
from the five furlongs the other day, and the ambu-
lance hopped off with them. When the van arrived
at the post the stewards directed the driver to go
back towards the field, which was still staggering
along in the direction of the judge. The sending ot
the ambulance back showed great foresight, because
one of the nags sat down and the medical corps had
to bring the rider home. The recumbent moke then
sprang up and dashed off towards the skyline at top
pace, and might have escaped if a soldier who had
returned with only one leg had not retained his
presence of mind. After a chase he seized the moke
by the tail, and hopping on top ran the winner to a
head. Meanwhile the damaged jockey had been
operated on at the hospital and discharged, and was
waiting on crutches for the to finish.
\ little bunch of Australian Cup entrants
stretched their legs in the Epsom (Melb.) Turf Club
Cup last Saturday. Thanks to a donation by Frank
Mvers this \vas a £5OO event, and imported Half-a-
Glass had a good try to win it all the way, hut
was not quite good enough to carry his < st. < m.
to the bitter end. Semi Blue, who had a lot of
disappointments to atone for, gave the pacemaker
71b and a head beating, the well-backed King Kora
finishing fourth. Why the handicappers should con-
tinue to rate three-year-old King Kora as a nine-
stoner in these minor handicaps is as incomprehen-
sible as the persistency of his backers in making
him favorite. , *
\ F Laurie, of Mount Gambier (S.A.L
got 'into the way of doing handicapping for the
local racing club 60 years ago just ior the love ot
the game, and hasn’t been able to give it up till
now All the clubs in the South-East lately met to

and to hand him some trifles for remembrance on his
retirement. „

An Adelaide S.M. has astonished the
police bv asking* why they did not arrest the betting
clients of an arrested bookmaker. They had not
thought of it, it seems ; yet the amateurs are break-
ing the S. Aus. law just as much as the professional
is. But the whole law as to betting is a solemn
farce, just as every law must be that is passed to
please one section of the community, and does not
reflect the feelings of the people as a whole.
* * * *
“Carvex”: By the death of J. D. Ormond,
of Hawkes Bay (M.L.), the last of an old-time
bunch of racing men who flourished thereabouts went
to where the horse doesn’t matter. Ormond, Russell,
Douglas and Donnelly were for. a long time the best-
known names on the turf in that part of the
Shivery Isles, and all have gone west. Spencer
Gollan, whose horses raced there with more than
average success a quarter of a century ago, vanished
with ”his cash and mokes to England, and is still
winning an occasional event. These men, with
Stead, of Chchurch, and Geordie McLean, of Dunedin,
did a lot of other things besides own racehorses —
Gollan excepted, perhaps, and even he played golf—
but it was through owning horses that most people
knew anything about them. The Stead family is the
only one in which the old man’s passion survives to
any great extent among the young ’uns.
When Desert Gold races in Australia it
will be oniy in w.t.a. events. T. 11. Lowry, the
owner, offered his wife the net profits for the
benefit of patriotic funds in which she was interested.
The lady compromised and decided upon the endow-
ment of six beds in the Soldiers’ Hospital at Rotorua
and six in the Soldiers’ .Hospital to be built at
Napier. When not required for soldiers they are to
be available for any trainers and jockeys that may
be unfortunate enough to need them.
Desert Gold’s record : 08 starts, 29 firsts,
six seconds, three thirds. As a three-year-old she
won the 14 races she started in. Value of stakes
won, £16,890. Carlita won £17,525.
Syd Godfrey and Vince Blackburn have
had further controversy about the featherweight
title at Sydney Stadium, and during most of the
time Godfrey had his championship trembling in
the balance. At the end of the proceedings Arthur
Scott had arrived at a decision to remain neutral.
The draw, of course, left Godfrey with his title and
filled Blackburn with a great yearning to move for a
new trial. It was a good, hard scrap, with God-
frey [smiting the harder and missing the most fre-
quently. In the seventh a smack on the ear made
Blackburn wish it hadn’t happened, but he stood
the gaff well and was soon fighting back as strongly
as before.

“ Jwosp”: Taken off in France, George C.
Wilson, googlie bowler, of Canterbury (M.L.). Wil-
son was overshadowed by Sandman, now at the
Front, but got his chance when Sandman was with
the Maorilanders in Australia in 1913. He had a big
hand in keeping the Plunket bauble on the Plains,
not only with the ball, but al-o as a last-wicket
performer with 11. W. Monaghan, another bowler.
The pair had a habit of putting on 50 whenever they
got together at the tail. Eight wickets for 23 was
Wilson’s best in an inter-provincial match.

“Ranger”: Bombardier Stan Pearse, a
well-known Hawthorn (Vie.) lad, recently killed on
the West Front, was a proper sample of good Aus-
tralian. Small but perfectly proportioned, he was a
pocket Hercules among his ‘ athletic pals. He always
took great pride in keeping himself fit; and from
the day that he helped to drag the first two guns of
the 4th Battery up the cliffs at Gallipoli till he fell
shattered by an enemy shell on October 4 last, he
never, called on the A.M.C. ; and in those three
long strenuous years no cobber heard from him a
word of complaint.
R. D. Hodgins, who is attracting atten-
tion at the Sydney tennis carnival, is a promising
all-rounder. Among other things he and L. S.
Aitkeh defeated chamuion Horace Rice and L. O. S.
PoideVin in straight sets in the men’s doubles
(6 —2, 6—-4) ; and in the singles he outed the wily
G. P. Barbour (6—2, 2—6. 6—2). Hodgins re-
cently captained Sydney Grammar when the School
won the Great Public Schools cricket premiership
for the 18th time in 25 years. And at Rugby the
young man is a brilliant five-eighth.
There lias been only one hurricane inci-
dent in Sydney cricket, this season—W. S. McCloy’s
118 against North Sydney, of which 92 came from

“Tam o’ Shanter”: The gun of the Vic-
torian coekv that slaughtered 68 sparrows in one
act (B. 10/1/T8) must have kicked a bit. Under
extreme provocation from the spadger pest we once
invited them all to breakfast on wheat and bran. A
muzzle-loader was then attended _to on the Sunday-
school “full-and-overflowing” principle. When all
the guests had arrived our star marksman took bear-
ings and let bang both barrels simultaneously. After
he recovered from what happened we could only
gather 114 sparrows, hut there were some pieces that
might have made up another dozen or so. That was
the year the astronomers said there were spots on
the sun.
* * *
“H.V.E.” : There is no livelier fish than
mullet, when “on the feed.” . I’ve taken over two
dozen in about an hour on the mud-flats of a tidal
lake, or estuary, on the South Coast (N.S.W.). As
to bait, give me the soft parts of cungevoi for choice,
but many others will do, such as small bits of prawn,
crab, mullet viscera and a diminutive red worm
found in the sand of some beaches, but more often
about the mouths of creeks debouching directly into
the sea. This last lure mullet simply can’t resist.
I’ve even, when hard pushed, started operations with
flesh from the breast of a defunct and smellful
mutton-bird (short-tailed petrel) picked up on the
beach, and scored fairly well. It is quite true,
however, that full-grown sea mullet, which run to
about 18in. in length, rarely if ever take a bait;
but juniors up to about a foot may be coaxed sport-
ively into the frying-pan. Mullet contain a good
deal of soft, white fat, and prill nicely on the
coals without any preliminary basting. They should
be split down the back, so as to cook evenly right
through. The fish will thrive in perfectly fresh
water. Most South Coast ponds and lagoons contain
full-grown sea-mullet, but the rarer Eastern perch
(Australian bass) has disappeared from many of
them. These waters harbor enormous brown eels,
which undoubtedly prey on their fellow boarders.
“Wattlebark": Bruthen (Vic.) people
claim that the Tambo River is the finest place for
bream in Australia. Anyway, it s good enough.
Someone took a census one Sunday of the bream
caught within half a mile on each side of the bridge
over the river and worked the number out at 3000.
Two fishermen alone accounted for about 250. Down
at the Bemm River, away out in East Gippsland,
they reckon the catch, largely made up of bream, by
the ton; but then that’s net-fishing, so it doesn t
compare with the Tambo, where it is all line-work.
During the six months that the Bemm is open to
netting two waggons make the 37-mile trip to
twice a week, each carrying 30cwt. of fish, mostly
bream, will! a sprinkling of native salmon, luderick,
mullet and odds and ends.
“Ranger’': When “Geo. L. Hobson'’ (B.
27/12/’l7) says “once a target puncher gets off the
grass-mound and has to shorn without his sling he is
at sea,” he is all wrong. I know, because 1 was
reared in XE. Victoria. There the schoolboys
learned the rudiments of shooting at the target, and
then spent Sundays and wet days in the bush
strafing the marsupial population. No lad was
allowed to use “the big rifle” alone in the bush
until he could plant a reasonable average of shots
upon the “bull” at 500 yards. In the opinion of those
good experts, target-shooting is the way to learn
to shoot. The man 'Who is a mug at the target is
never, in my experience, a good field shot; but the
lead-slinger who can find the “bull” with regularity
needs little field practice to become an expert there.
Now about the cost to the Government, as to which
“Rio” worries (B. 22/11/’l7). I cannot say for
certain what they do now, but during my 10 years
experience of a club we paid all expenses ourselves,
except that the Defence Department issued 150
rounds of cartridges a year to each qualified marks-
man. 1 judge that each of the chaps used at least
1000 rounds a year, 850 of which he paid for.
Likewise he bought. his own rifle, oil, wind-gauge,
etc., paid travelling expenses to matches, , paid
markers’ fees, and most of the repairs on the butts
were done by the members in their spare time. Our
men used to pay exes, out of fox and wallaby
skins, which according to “Geo. L. Hobson” we
should not have been able to hit.
N.S.W. Education Department’s estimate
that 80 per cent, of the girls and 70 per cent, of
the boys learned to keep afloat during the vacation
swimming classes sets a main for other State Educa-
tion Departments. The instructors handled over 5000
children, and are optimistically looking forward to
7000 next time. The Department might go farther
and make the scheme more practical by including
life-saving classes. Instruction in “what to do ’ and
“how f to do it” would finish the job off properly.

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 22/6
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
TTHE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
-*■ for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia.
We quote our “L.S.” Special Judhpores in Military
Drills at 22/6, tailor-made to order. Other materials are
obtainable up to £4.
SAMPLES ARE POST FREE
with tape, self-measurement form, copy of catalogue, etc. We
make to a 6-day schedule. We Pay Freight. We Guarantee
Satisfaction. Write us To-day.

To suffer with fortitude is
heroic, but to suffer needlessly
is idiotic. While most sufferers
regard pain as due to the
dispensation of Providence,
doctors see in it a certain
neglect—the neglect of simple
rules of health.
OF all rheumatic afflictions acute lumbago is the
most painful. It arises from a gradual accumu-
lation of excess uric acid in the system ; the muscles of
the lower back become impregnated until the muscu-
lar fibres stiffen and every movement causes agony.
The simple habit of taking Kruschen Salts every
morning cleanses the system of excess uric acid, braces
the nerves and gives to the user the daily - enjoyment
of natural vigorous health. Get the Kruschen habit.

F. AY. Young is the first S. Australian
Agent-General to get knighted during his
term of office.
Professor Barry is agitating in Melbourne
for compulsory domestic training for girls.
He says most young wives ruin the tempers
of their babies by their ignorance of baby-
craft. The Bulletin is thoroughly in
accord with this new peace movement.
Westralia, v/hic’h has kept itself free from
the imported sparrow pest, notes with alarm
that the bird is steadily making its way
west along the new railway line. That
shows how wise the old Groper was. In
1840 South Aus., then less than four years
old, wanted to make communication by land
with its western neighbor, and the latter
showed “fierce opposition,” chiefly on the
ground that a road would enable bush-
rangers from the east to make “raids” upon
it!
“C. Ockney”: Foster Fraser has turned
aside from his guide-books and perpetrated a
play. Like the immortal baby born to Jack
Easy’s wetnurse, it is only a little one, but
proves an acceptable war-time item. It is
called “The Grousers” and tells of a typical
Cockney couple who are continually grum-
bling over war conditions, and a tram-con-
ductress’s daughter who is instrumental in
bringing them to a less grousey frame of
mind. The novelty is being played in the
Stoll vaudeville houses.
Barring political disputes, the life of a
poll-clerk would seem to be as free from
risk as any. But there is no dodging luck.
At the little polling-station of Avon, near
Balaklava (S.A.), a brown snake appeared
from under the floor of the room while the
Referendum voting was going on. Arthur
Reid, one of the officials, •'went for it with a
broom, which broke when it hit the floor,
and by a piece of incredibly rotten luck a
piece flew up into his right eye, which ulti-
mately had to be removed at the Adelaide
Hospital.
Edmund Jowett, the liard-faccd old gent,
who climbed into the House of Reps, over
his pile of wool-bales, is doing the handsome
thing where it will do most good. He has
passed over -a large cheque to the Argus for
distribution, and- gets his name in the paper
for these amounts, among others: 100
guineas to the Sunday School Union prize-
fund, £5O for the Trinity College chapel
organ fund, a fiver for the North Melbourne
Congregational Sabbath-school, and three-
pun-ten for the Methodist Mission at Fitz-
roy. Every little helps; ,and no doubt
Jowett reckons he will need it all at the next
elections, since he hasn’t AVon the AA T ar yet.
Even the aproned bloke who pares the
. gun-horses’ hoofs hasn’t allowed himself to
be left out of it. Charles Curtayne, of Chew-
ton (Vic.), has won the Military Medal.
He is a shoeing-smitli, and is the first Aus-
tralian on this job to get it. He took time
off from his farrier-sergeant’s job last Octo-
ber to go out with the boys on a succession
of risky raids, and his fighting style brought
him ilito notice early and often.
From' Illustrated London News, Aug.
21, 1552 : —-
The Postmaster-General has entered into a con-
tract with the pi opi ietors of the screw-steamer Great
Britain for the conveyance of mails to Melbourne
and Sydney in Australia. The Great Britain will
leave Liverpool on the 21st inst., and will probably
reach Melbourne about 50 days afterwards. This is
the first instance of the Postmaster-General entering
into an ...extra mail contract; but the size and speed
of the Great Britain, together with the great immi-
gration movement now in progress, fully justifies the
unusual proceeding. The postage of letters by this
packet will be one shilling each and newspapers will
be sent free. All letters for 1 Melbourne and Sydney
posted up to the 21st will be sent by her, unless
specially addressed to be otherwise sent.
The Great Britain on that voyage was com-
manded by Capt. Mathews, the chief officer
being John Gray (afterwards skipper, and
mysteriously lost overboard). Among the
passengers was Reginald Bright, a cadet of
the house owning the ship. He is still atop.
The Great Britain is now a hulk at Port
Stanley, Falkland Isles.
“Binnacle”: There is at present in an
Australian port, which I mustn’t mention, a
nueer-lookip" craft Hat was at one time
reckoned a floating palace, the City of Syd-
mj. She was biu.i in 1875 by the Facific
Mail Co., and after being for some years pen-
sioned off was rudely awakened lately from
her slumbers in Rotten Row. her innards
gutted out and a line of six masts stuck into
her. One of the newest things in war-time
sailing ships, she has started again to earn
dividends. Incidentally, the “fast and
favorite” Gabo of the ’eighties has been sold
“to the East,” and the one-time popular
coaster is to go off the Australian register.
She did more than earn her bunker coal for
Howard-Smith during the last 37 years, and
now she has brought a price that a couple
of years ago would have sounded incredible.
The old steamer is figuring in a queer case
of alleged fraud in the Sydney law courts.
The defendants are- stated to have separated
some prominent city men from considerable
cash on their say-so that they owned the
boat. One would think it as easy to raise a
mortgage on the G.P.O.
About a wreck and a banquet: —
Died Christmas week at Mount Victoria (N.S.AV.),
in her 79th year, Johanna Bentley, widow of John,
who predeceased her 35 years. The couple were the
chief figures in a romantic story which goes back to
1855, when Johanna arrived, a fine lass of 16, from
Ireland, in a ship which was wrecked off Kangaroo
Island (S.A.). When the survivors sorted themselves
out, the colleen found herself in the arms of her
future husband, a stalwart trooper in the S.A.
Mounted Police, who took part in the rescue. After
marriage the pair went to Sydne.y, and after many
years’ service in the mounted police John died at
Hartley, leaving a family* 0 f 10. Their con-
nection with the S. Australian family was
recalled by the death of the last of John Bent-
ley’s brothers, Thomas Friend Bentley, a bachelor,
intestate. lie was an eccentric who lived in a state
of siege at the Burra (S.A.), and had saved a tidy
fortune of five figures. On the news of his* death
38 nephews and nieces sprang forward to claim his
wealth. The Blue Mountains family naturally put
in for their share, but some of the S.A. branch
opposed this addition to the list of claimants. The
John Bentleys promptly employed a firm of lawyers
to look after their interests, and as a result the
Supreme Court of S. Aus. has ordered that John’s
children are to be invited to the feast.

Do you live in the home
.A SILENT PIANO?
THERE it stands, in lonely gloom close by die wall,
an expensive tombstone on the grave of vanished
joy. You personally never could play very much,
and lack of practice has still further stiffened your
fingers. The children are only in the five-finger exercise
' stage and other interests have impaired your wife’s
never-to-be-much-talked-about technique.
And so your“silent”Piano stands
deteriorating through lack of
use. Why not alter it all ? Why
not take advantage of the liberal
allowance we make on “silent”
Pianos and enjoy all the pleasure
which a Beale Player - Piano
affords. It is an instrument which
supplies faultless technique with a
rich, resonant tone. Eight ex-
pression devices give absolute
tone control, enabling one to get
the fullest wealth of colour and
feeling out of every selection
played. A knowledge of music is
quite unnecessary. All that is
required is an intelligent appre-
ciation of rhythm, accent and
expression. Informal concerts are
held daily.
Call and let us demonstrate how easy it is for you to
play all your favourite music the “Beale" Player-way.

Gnareite: Agree with you mostly; but
there was this difference: the Russian armies were,
in parts, practically unarmed —they had the same
chance as the sheep with the slaughterman. The
French, being under a different sort of government,
weren’t sent out in that condition... .S.: Thanks;

force enough.. , .G.P.M.: You’ll have to take a lot
more'care before your verses sing. .. .lviki: Bump
and wriggle, wriggle and bump. ... O. Riole: Thin,
old wheeze in waddling verse... .L.J.: It feebly
fluttered into the basket... .A.S.: The “Witch” has
some quality, but doesn't move along with an even
step. .. .E. M.T.: Not enough in it....R.K.: It drops

Get rid of the absurd habit of talking to your “dear

commonplace. .. .J.M.A.: Says no new thing. .. .K.S.:
Not much in that way of putting it. ...H.D.: Hope-
less G.G.: The “Vision” goes thinly in faded

You have the knack. Tackle something you mean
to say 8.F.: The idea is rather 01d....
F.A.M.D.: Wooden stuff, without lift or novelty. .. .
J.M.S.: Simple verse that is pleasing enough but
doesn’t grip... . J.M.N.: That point of view is a few
summers out of date. . .C.F.P.: But it isn’t worth
saying. 1. .Sergeant Jack: Verse too rugged....
A.F.F.: There's a direct vigor about this: —
Once when an Angel was walking
* Down a quiet country lane,
She came across a small boy,
Crying as if in pain.
The Angel softly bent and asked him,
“Tell me, child, do you cry?”
The boy lifted his tear-stained face,
And this was his reply:
“I went to church last Sunday,
Where they tell you the way to Heaven.
And the preacher said, ‘Sorrow for your sins,
If you wish them to be forgiven.’
“I know' they must be cleverer than I.
So here behold I sorrow.
So though to-day I weep and pray,
I’ll be forgiven and happy to-morrow.
.. . .Mag: The verse doesn’t carry it. . . .K.S.:
Nearly ; but rather short of punch Rumas: Very
slight idea. Why write “will” when you mean
“shall”? L.M.R.: Pleasing little thing, but not
quite strong enough for a flight into print....
Pariah: Sonnet is fair, but doesn’t say enough
Comedy King: Crude scrap O.B.: It has the
unusual quality which first marked you for distinc-
tion :
The Commemoration day is one of greatness,
Although it heaves a sigh of sadness;
But there we see our brave colors of freshness,
To remind us of our forefathers of their boldness.
To see it is our 81th anniversary ;
It’s well to remember our history ;
That we all should know supplementary,
And to give praise to them in all their gttory.
Now may the pioneers see the end of sadness,
For they w ere the men that stood the life of stress ;
That they may see the end of all this madness,
And to sec the long and broad road to progress.
... .Manly V.: It has a strained, unhappy look in its
humor... .G.A.: A hundred people have said it
better J.H.: Not up Venus: No, it doesn't
yell for print E. J.S.: Slight fancy that doesn't
grip sufficiently... .A. K.S.: Take the unclean thing
away and ask the garbage-man to hide it. .. .
M.C.11.: No mistake; the verses were simply un-
suitable Alidon: You might drop those stories
with advantage... .A..1.K.: (1) Thanks; (2) don’t
know “whether the Federal Ministers are as patriotic
as they profess to be.” Write to the Governor-
General ; he’s paid a hefty salary for answering fool-
ish questions... .Hal August: Where did you learn
that Chaplin had held up the Northcliffe press?
That would be a dream!
“Ambulance”: Many Australian nurses
have already won the Royal Red Cross in
this war. No medal is worn with greater
pride, for the traditions of the profession
are high, and the army nurse who. gains
it must have proved herself a capable leader
over and over again. The pity of it is that
when the strain of campaigning has weak-
ened the nurse’s health and shortened her
professional career, there is no pension for
her. As the effects of war often only show'
themselves years afterwards, an army nurse
with a . good record should be eligible to
apply for an adequate military pension any
time after the completion of service. As
for the R.R.C.-winner, high military honors
won at the cost of health are liable to
embitter the struggling possessor in after
years; the decoration then becomes merely
the symbol of a nation’s empty thanks.
“Scray” : I think I met a coming Prime
Minister at court the other morning. The
case was one in which a push had dealt with
an enemy by dropping a 9 x 12 bluestone
channel-pitcher upon his head after first fell-
ing him with a beer-bottle (full). The de-
fence was an alibi, supported by ground and
lofty perjury. “I never touched ’irn,” said,
the accused; “why, I don’t even know the
man!” The instructing John Hop whis-
pered the prosecuting inspector. “Isn’t it
a fact,” asked the latter, “that you and he
are mates—you go about together?” “We
ain’t,” protested the injured innocent in the
box. “I don’t know ’im, I tell y’!” “What
do you mean, sir, by such a statement?”
interposed the Chairman of the Bench sternly
(he keeps a shop opposite the pub head-
quarters of the push). “Why, I’ve seen you
together! How dare you say ybu don’t
know the man?” “W T ell, I don’t,” persisted
the poor persecuted one. “I orfen seen him, o’
course, but I never had a drink with ’im in
me life.”

They will March
on Neolin Soles
United States Government Contract Specifies Neolin
The first big U.S. Government contract
specifying Neolin Soles was awarded to a
large New England manufacturer.
This unqualified recognition and endorse-
ment of Neolin came after rigid competitive
tests under the most exacting demands of
service.
Numerous manufacturers tendered when the
U.S. Government officials were considering
a scientific substance to supplant leather soles.
But Neolin best withstood the rigorous tests
which had to be passed. So, in this the
first contest to decide a ‘better than leather’
soles, Neolin won out.
Just as Neolin proved itself the ‘better than leather’
sole for the footwear of U.S.A. fighting men, so it
will prove itself for you if you will give it the
opportunity.
-- - s
For Neolin soles, by giving better, longer, more
comfortable wear, can save for you the first day
you wear them.
Get Neolin soles and comfort your feet with the
spring and buoyancy which they cannot help but
impart.
Neolin’s appearance can be imitated, but its qualities are the
result of methods and materials known only to Goodyear.
Now, there are other soles that look like Neolin, but there is
only one Neolin and every pair of Neolin soles is branded
Neolin on the instep, and every pair of half soles bears
the word Neolin which is your absolute guarantee of
satisfaction. The shop from which you buy your footwear
can supply boots or shoes with Neolin soles ; if they can’t,
advise the nearest Goodyear branch or agency.

The Latest HUDSON SUPER-SIX is a Speedster
TlThe newest Hudson Super-Six model is a four passenger Speedster. Because
of its graceful lines, the beauty of the finish, and the wonderful speed it
possesses we think it rightly expresses "the spirit of youth!' TjThe coach
is painted rich cobalt blue, and the wheels are in Knglish vermilion. It is
mounted on the same Hudson Super-Six Chassis that has won so many
notable records for power, speed and endurance. Go to the nearest Hudson
dealer and see this new car.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION
WITHOUT ROUGE OR POWDER.
Many women—both young and
suffer greatly from sallow complexions.
Sometimes this is the result of climatical
conditions, sometimes the cause is constitu-
tional ; but whatever it be, it is decidedly
unnatural and unpleasant. Bathing in milk
occasionally is said to be most helpful and
soothing to the skin, but just try the follow-
ing recipe, which any chemist will make up
for you: Two oz. of rose-water, 2oz. flowers
of oxzoin and one dram tincture of benzoin.
Apply this night and morning with a sponge
after washing, and let it dry on, then dust
the skin lightly with a soft cloth. This
home-made lotion is one of the best, and
supersedes rouge or powder, leaving the skin
heautifuflv soft, clear and smooth. —Advt.

CHANDLER SIX, Price £585.
CHANDLER RECORDS ARE OWNERS’ RECORDS.
Not to our knowledge has a professional motor-car driver ever made a record with a
Chandler Six.
But all the thousands of owners of Chandler Sixes, every day, are making the kind
of records that count, records of satisfactory service.
The Chandler Company has never built a racing car. Chandler owners do not want
racing cars.
The 55 to 60 miles per hour speed that every Chandler Car will do is speed much
greater than you would ever ask for.
The Chandler Company has never built a special mountain-climbing car, with short
wheel base and low gear ratio.
The ease with 'which every Chandler climbs steep grades on high gear is satisfying
to the Chandler owner.
The Chandler Company has never supplied any Chandler Dealer anywhere with a
special gear ratio for demonstrating purposes.
What any Chandler Six does YOUR Chandler Six will do.
The manufacturer of one six can make just as big claims as the manufacturer of
any other six. But
The Chandler is a Fact-Car, not a Claim-Car.
And these are Facts not Claims.
There is no other Six more flexible in control, more responsive to your every demand than the Chandler.
There is no other which will pull hard grades on high with greater ease.
There is no other so economical in operation.
There is no other which embodies in its design and construction so many features characteristic of high-grade, high-priced motor-cars,
lhere is no other of more beautiful body lines or greater riding comfort.

No manager has deserved his luck more
than Asche. Eight years ago, when he
came to Australia, he gambled on his chance
of getting good support if he did the thing
handsomely. He spent his last shilling,
so to speak, on equipment. Many hundreds
of pounds w r ere devoted to the outfit of Lily
Brayton alone. Nothing short of big suc-
cesses for “Taming of the Shrew,”
“Othello,” “Count Hannibal,” etc., would
have built up another bank account for
Oscar. With the money he made in Aus-
tralia he took another risk when he pro-
duced “Kismet” in London. There was no
encouraging precedent for this venture. The
play was in a class by itself, and it had
to be a costly production. “Kismet” was
such a great go that Asche practically gave
up a certainty for an uncertainty when he
stopped the run in order to fulfil his con-
tract to return to Australia. The unusual
play gave him another boom on this side,
and then he kept his managerial reputation
boiling with a great, original production of
“Antony and Cleopatra.” There never was
anything meanly commercial about Oscar
A.sche. He never played for safety. To
think of doing “Chu Chin Chow” at all
was to think of doing it extravagantly, and
that’s how Asche did it.

tralia, and only the
hypercritical would
deny that the re-
sult is good enough
for anything. The
costumes are rich
and smart and
tasteful. The color
schemes, in con-
junction with scen-
ery and lighting,
are artistic. There
doesn’t seem to be
any striving for ex-
ceeding subtlety of
charm in the
effects; on the
other hand, there
is no instance of
the designers hav-
ing strained after
ori g i nality and
missed the ’bus. So
the J.C.W. firm
has arrived at a
time of experience
and opulence when
it can put up a
very imposing
panto, without “specially importing” any-
body or anything.
“75”: Frank Crossley, who used to sup-
ply comic relief in Anderson and Marlow
dramas, is now in France, and has made
himself popular with brother Billjims by
producing special versions of “Dick Whit-
tington,” “The New Barmaid” and “Fun
on the Bristol” for their private consump-
tion. The authorities have provided Frank
with a theatre, scenery and a company, and
lie was lately doing two shows daily. Gen-
eral Birdwood and the Wales princeling
dropped in to see “Whittington,” in which
Crossley played the Dame.
Richard Bellairs, who for some years has
figured (mostly as the villain) in dramas
under Bilanderson and Bailey-Grant man-
agement, is swapping the slapstick for the
yard-wand or some such weapon. He is
joining a Flinders-lane warehouse that deals
in woollens. The stage won’t lose a great
actor, but the profesh will miss a fine fellow,
wholly free from the airs of the average
mummer. Bellairs pushes a neat pen, too —
his name has been at the foot of a good
deal of Bulletin verse and prose.
Robert Parker, the operatic baritone who
was one of the court cards in Quinlan’s
pack in Australia, is now with Sir Thomas
Beecham in London. He was leading voice
recently in an elaborate Drury Lane produc-
tion of Rimsky-Ivorsakov’s Russian opera,
“Ivan the Terrible,” and successfully sang
the tremendous name part.

David Souter’s ideas on “Have Australian
theatrical managers given Australian authors
a fair show?” (B. 10/1/TS)
J. C. Williamson asked me once “How can they?”
Dates are booked at least a year ahead for shows
which have already achieved success. They arrive
“ready to wear” —scenery, costumes, business, props
and performers. To produce a musical play from
script and score runs into some thousands of
pounds. Why should the Australian manager gamble
on an unknown horse when there is a tried per-
former ready to run? For one thing, he would have
to raise his prices of admission considerably to
cover the loss on plays which didn’t meet their
printing bill. The opportunity for the Australian
author seems to be in either amateur production,
which is quite rotten as a rule, or getting some
friends with enough faith in his ability to spar up
a few hundreds and give him a show. “The Gray
Kimono” got a two-nights’ run at Sydney Criterion
this way. “Mrs. Pretty and the Premier” was heard
the other way, and Arthur Adams got it staged in
England on the strength of its Australian notices.
“The Rajah of Shivapore” knew enough of Alfred
Hill’s friends and mine to pay the Maternity Hospi-
tal exes. The baby is now walking, and if it
doesn’t fall down and break its neck in the next
week or two it may develop into a champion.
“8.J.” : If you took a vote in the profesh
regarding the fatness or otherwise of Hamlet
I would have no doubt of the result. It is
considered the fattest part in drama.
Dorothy Brunton has made her N’Yark
debut in “Follow the Girl,” a new musical
show.
“A.M. J.” : The curtain dropped suddenly
in London on Fred Billington, of operatic
fame. He was a Yorkshireman and made
his first appearance with D’Oyly Carte in
1579, and was without interruption a mem-
ber of the famous combination till the end
of his long career. C. H. Workman, of the
J.C.W. Firm, played Ko Ko to Billington’s
Pooh Bah in the “Mikado” several hundred
times. The big man had been Lord High
Everything-else more than 3600 times. His
favorite part was Wilfrid Shadbolt in “The
Yeomen of the Guard”; but the one he
played oftenest was that of benefactor to
struggling mummers. Death was due to
syncope.
“Nosey” : Theatrical and picture manage-
ments are to be dealt another crack from
musicians and stage hands. There is a
movement afoot to merge
the two unions, so that
the fat capitalist may re-
ceive the full weight of
the waddy. A new
musicians’ log Las been
drafted, with figures
much higher than they
are at present. It asks
£4 10s. for the chap who
plays the big drum and
makes sundry noises
often better loft out of
the unbalanced combina-
tion of sounds proceeding
P'om what is alleged to
be an orchestra. The
musician is worthy of his
hire, but to ask a first-
class violinist —usually a
person of some tempera-
ment —to have his pence-
card ticked off in the
same atmosphere as that
of a sceneshifter is a
pretty stroke at Art.
Another humorous item
in the new log is a tenner
a week for union men
who play the organ. The
campaign is to be talked
over at Sydney, where all
the big chiefs —O’Brien,
Davidson, Huckerby and
“Dick Whit-
tington,” at
Her Majesty's,
Melbourne.
Ernest Lang-
ford as Johnny.
others—will meet. Under present condi-
tions show business isn’t flourishing by any
means; and with the application of the
thumbscrew writer can tip a few people out
of a collar.
“Masetto”: The remarks of Irma Caron
in a recent Bulletin on the lack of stage
deportment and so forth in our lady concert
artists applies in some cases to male per-
formers. Take the case of the young Mel-
bourne violinist, Cecil Parkes. The last
time I heard him play was at one of the
municipal concerts. He was recalled and
bowed his acknowledgments, said bow being
a lifting of the chin towards the ceiling, fol-
lowed by a violent ducking of the head so
that the back of his collar could be seen.
At these concerts encores are not allowed;
but the delighted audience brought back the
talented youth half a dozen times to repeat
the strange gymnastic feat.
The father of just-dead Horace Rogers,
doyen of Sydney reporters, was a soldier
in Tasmania who outshone all the offi-
cers in garrison theatricals. In his
professional career he took old-man parts
principally, but he could act anything.
Jefferson found Lord Dundreary in him for
the Sydney season. Rogers came to Mel-
bourne from the London Theatre, Launces-
ton, in ’45 with Coppin’s co. They opened
in “The Lady of Lyons,” with Rogers as
Damas. The next night they gave “The
School for Scandal,” with Coppin as Sir
Peter Teazle and Rogers as Sir Oliver
Surface. Later, however, Rogers established
himself as a matchless Sir Peter, and took
the part at the opening of Melbourne Royal
in ’55. Mathews, much later, had the high-
est opinion of him.
“S.”: There is no conviction in “The Bird
of Paradise,” there is no reality in Muriel
Starr’s supposedly semi-barbaric Hawaiian.
You sit out this kind of drama, watch the
gyrations of the characters, and are never
under the delusion that you ary- concerning
yourself with the real troubles of real people.
When the fairy-tale element is abandoned in
dealing with primitives like the Hawaiians,
there is one satisfaction left. The heroine
of “The Bird of Paradise” is merely an ordi-
nary enough white woman a little possessed.
She is not half as barbaric as Hedda Gabler,
for instance; and Muriel Starr’s island belle,
even in her most emotional moment, is not a
whit nearer the cave-girl than any bit of
skirt might be oh St. Kilda sands on a nice
night. One column-and-a-half story of the
South Seas by Louis Becke is worth the
whole three acts of “The Bird” and all the
actors.
“Glen Huntly” : By his will Beerbohm Tree
disposed of property worth £44,085. John L.
Toole beat that with £79,984; but Toole was
76 when he died, and £70,000 came from the
resumption of Toole’s Theatre. Edward
Terry’s fortune was within £29 of Tree’s. A
few others: Wilson Barrett, £30.862; Edwin
Booth, £24,000; Irving, £20,527; George
Grossmitli, £19,628; Corney Grain, £18,950;
Fred Leslie, £16,113; Dan Leno, £10,994;
George Coppin, £10,232; George Rignold,
£11,000; William Rignold, £4196; Charles
Kean, £35.000; Ada Rehan, £35,000. and E.
S. Willard, the first Spider in “The Silver
King,” £14,650.
English film-producers, though they don’t
seem able to get authors to write new plots
for them, strike a big thing occasionally.
One just completed is a life of Kitchener,
covering Egypt (with the end of General
Gordon at Khartoum and the avenging of
him at Omdurman), S’Africa and India,
ending up with the present war. The set-
ting is all faked in England.

LADS AND LASSES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A well-loved voice from the prompt wing calls ;
A blare of brass and a roll of drums ;
A cheer from gallery, pit and stalls —-
Down to the footlights the g'irl-“boy” comes.
Her well-graced figure and face aglow
Recall names, still with a pow’r to thirl,
Of jolly “boys” of the long-ago—
But what was the name of last year's “girl” ?
Meredith Meredro, Florence Young,
Sybil Arundale, Vi Loraine—
Often the praise of these lads we’ve sung ;
Memory murmurs their praise again.
The Iris fair that we knew as “Lil,”
Ravensburg, Imeson—one could hurl
Names by the dozen of “boys” ; but, still,
What was the name of last year’s “girl” ?
Life is a panto., with jokes and joys;
Our minds hark back to the laughing past,
Bringing to memory names of boys,
For they were our friends, and friendships last.
The loves that thrilled us we now forget
(Whose was this garter? And whose these
curls?) ;
The boys of the past we remember yet—
But uhat were the names of our principal girls?
VICTORIA.

THE VENGEANCE OF THE HEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were a company dramatic
Whom rascal Fate had treated ill;
Our failures frequent and emphatic,
From Tooraloo to Pinlcer’s Mill,
Had left us reft of grub and money,
And also minus half our duds.
We robbed the wild bees of their honey,
And Maurice Meeghan of his spuds.
These things alone must serve for dinner
Before we played that night in Yam
The stirring drama, “Clive, the Sinner” ;
But where we sat beside the dam
There came a rooster and a pullet,
And Cuthbert stole his gun to find.
He slew the rooster with a bullet.
The pullet clamored while we dined.
For once our audience seemed contented.
The barn was full, and I insist
Old Cuthbert finely represented
The noble Earl, and no one hissed,
Till broke a yell of frantic laughter,
And after that our hope fell dead—
That pullet, perched upon a rafter,
Had dropped an egg on Cuthbert’s head!

In the Overland Big Four-cylinder touring
car and the Overland Light Four-cylinder
touring car, the luxurious and the practical
are in proper balance to produce lasting satis-
faction.
The Big Four is finished in a deep rich
brown, while the colour of the Light Four is
a beautiful shade of gray.
These two models exemplify the remark-
able values made possible by tremendous pro-
duction.
Size does not of itself constitute greatness.
An industry is as great as its service to
the public.
But size does usually constitute oppor-
tunity for service.
In the case of Willys-Overland, size origi-
nally was an indication of foresight and courage.
It constituted an opportunity to establish
new values in motor cars —this was a service.
Growth came as a reward of this service,
and with growth came opportunity for further
service—further revision of values.
Today’s immensity means experience,
facilities and resources, plus the public con-
fidence, which gives these things stability for
yet greater service.
The Willys-Overland ideal of service is in-
tegrity of value in the product throughout
the whole life of that product’s service.
The Willys-Overland Motor Cars which
we have to show you exemplify this ideal
and constitute the most comprehensive range
of models ever built by any one motor car
producer.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
The Killing of Superfluous Hair.
It is easy to remove superfluous hair tem-
porarily, but to remove it permanently is
quite another matter. Not many women
know that for this purpose such a simple
substance as powdered pheminol may be
used, applied directly to the hair. The recom-
mended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, but also to event-
ually kill the roots entirely. Almost any
chemist could supply an ounce of pheminol,
Ivliieh quantity should be sufficient.
Renewing Complexions by Absorption.
If your complexion is marred with sallow-
ness, moth patches, pimples or freckles, it is
useless to potter with powders and paints,
lotions, creams and things in an effort to get
rid of the trouble. Unless you have some
ability as an artist, you will mar your ap-
pearance still more. The new and rational
way is to take off the complexion itself, with
all its offensive marks. Just get some pure
mercolized wax at the chemist’s and use at
night the same as cold cream. Remove next
morning with water and soap, following with
dash of cold water. The mercolized wax
absorbs the half-dead scarf skin in flaky
particles, so gradually that no one guesses
you are treating your face—unless it be by
the result, which is truly wonderful. There
is nothing like it for bestowing a natural,
healthy and beautiful complexion.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly
corrected by a unique new process. A tablet
of stymol, obtained from the chemist, is
dropped in a tumbler of hot water, which will
then of course “fizz” briskly. When the
effervescence has subsided the face is bathed
with the stymol-charged water and then dried
with a towel. The offending blackheads, of
their own accord, come right off on the
towel, the large oily pores immediately con-
tract and efface themselves naturally. There
is' no squeezing, forcing, or any drastic
action. The skin is left, uninjured, smooth,
soft and cool. A few such treatments should
be taken at intervals of three or four days
thereafter in order to insure the permanence
of the pleasing result so quickly obtained.
Don’t Have Grey Hair.
Grey hair is often a serious handicap to
both men and women while still., in the prime
of life. Hair dyes are not advisable because
they are always obvious, inconvenient and
often down-right injurious. Few people know
that a very simple formula, which is easily
made up at home, will turn the hair back to
a natural color in a perfectly harmless man-
ner. You have only to get two ounces, of
tammalite concentrate from your chemist and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum to prove
this. Apply' tins simple and harmless lotion
for a few nights to the hair with a small
sponge, and the greyness will gradually dis-
appear. The lotion is neither, sticky nor
greasy and has been proved over and over
again for generations past by those in pos-
session of the formula.
About Shampoos.
To quote an eminent London beauty
specialist : “The slimy egg cannot -dissolve
the,; scalp impurities, but only adds to the
trouble by completely choking the pores with
animal matter.” The substance sticks, de-
composes, thereby causing the hair to assume
a dead, “dull color.” Avoid eggs (and soap
too);, on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful of
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beauty possibilities in your hair,
will clear and prevent dandruff, and leave
that fine fluffy effect so much sought after.
It also removes excess oil or greasiness. [1

CHINESE WORSHIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I idolise my blue-eyed Floss!
I humbly bring her gifts and flowers
And worship her for hours and hours.
But there are other days, old hoss,
When I would love to beat my joss!

AH TOO SOON (Washing done).
The spitefulness of fate. Mrs. Richard
Darling, of Carlton (Vic.), had five sons
on service. At last word arrived that one
was coining home; and she bustled out to
buy a few odds and ends for his welcome. ..
The verdict was “Accidental death” —killed
by a tramcar.
What is the origin of the word Bispham,
anyhow? The now-decorated Attorney-
General for the Speck is William Bispham
Propsting, and there is a famous old bari-
tone singer named David Bispham, whose
son was the first American soldier to be
killed in France. If Propsting was ever a
prop with a sting in it. Bispham was pro-
bably a ham of the bisp variety. But what
was a bisp?
Randolph Bedford writes :
“Cato” (B. 27/12/T7) sidesteps my reply except
to repeat the lie of the Ryan Government funking
the strikers. The facts! The strike would have
cost millions had it spread ; the Queensland Govern
ment, holding to the Arbitration law rigidly, and
giving away nothing, fixed it at a cost of about
£l5O, representing Ihe exes, of the unionists’ dele-
gation to Brisbane. The gang who would have pre-
ferred the 'loss of millions and the misery of a
general strike in order to blacken the Government’s
face, roared even at the £l5O.
About Japanese dogs t
Sessue walked into the Thursday Island Hospital
wifh a little dog in his pocket. I wanted it. “Can
I buy ?” I asked. Sessue drew his breath through
his teeth and bowed his head. It was a dear doggie
and looked like a silk chrysanthemum. Sessue said
as I was so kind to the sick Japanese he would leave
the dog now. “But ask what he wants for it,” said
wise old Captain John Strachan, who was waiting to
see the doctor about a pearl concession. I asked,
“As madam is so good and kind to our sick Japan-
ese,” said Sessue, “she may have it for £70.” 1
gasped. The Captain explained that £7O was cheap,
and that the dog probably had a pedigree five hundred
years long. Nowadays I always ask the price.
William Uden has ended a useful but
monotonous life's Work. An English sailor
from boyhood, South Aus. caught him young
and put him on a sandhill outside the Port
River mouth, his job being to work a sema-
phore when ships were sighted. Then official
whaleboats went off and boarded them—and
the crews sometimes got drowned in the pro-
cess. Uden stood on that sandhill for just
half a century, and saw the Semaphore grow
into a popular seaside suburb, though the
building of an Outer Harbor has taken away
most of its old importance. The old survivor
of sailing-ship days lived on to be S 3.
“Rookus” : A neat little swindle is worked
on you and me by some cute railway travel-
lers. The Mountain train which leaves
Mount Victoria at G a.m. pulls up at Pen-
rith, where tickets are collected. A lady
recently presented one for Strathfield. The
collector told her that she would have to get
out at Homebush. as that train did not stop
at Strathfield. She thanked him, and the
train moved on. At Homebush I remarked
to her that she had reached her destination.
She smiled sweetly and said she had changed
her mind and was going to Sydney. By this
little dodge, you see, you save the fare from
Strathfield to Sydney.
One big woman about another:
I speak of Beatrice Grimshaw by name. I have
just returned from London, where they always do.
Pearson’s and such folk star her, solus, on their City
of London posters: “A brilliant new short story by
Beatrice Grimshaw.” I endorse what she says about
growing things in Papua. One can grow almost any-
thing there. I was assured by the head of the Agri-
cultural Department that rice was impossible. Others
who knew more about the country said the same.
Not'long afterward I had a bag of seed rice sent
me from Java. I scraped trenches under my house
in Moresby and planted the seed and kept it well
watered. It grew. And I ate rice. Not much, as I
only tried with a little. But rice, and of my own
growing. Returning to her. With all her fine, big
outlook on life 1 never met a woman who was more
womanly. She wears clothes that make us gasp and
say “How sweet!’’ And I never saw another who
can put on a glove so perfectly.
A century ago Napoleon summed up Prus-
sianism. In the memoirs of Madame Junot
it is recorded that her husband secured
Nap.’s consent to say that any of those sol-
diers who would eschew their queues and
hair-powder would do what was agreeable
to their general, hut that there was to be
no compulsion. There was much hair-cut-
ting next day; also, because of tall talk
among those who wanted to insist on the
thing being done, a few duels. Napoleon soon
heard of this and wrote: “Junot, —-I ap-
proved of your plan because I conceived it
to be useful, but I forbid all Prussian
measures. I will have no improvements
effected in my army either by fighting or
flogging.— Bonaparte.”
“Pejay”: A reunion of old scholars was
held last month at Gape Bridgewater, Port-
land (Vic.), to celebrate the 52nd anniver-
sary of the local State school. Of the 30
children who attended on the opening day,
29 are still alive and well. The unlucky one
was fatally burnt a few years ago. Oh, it’s
a most debilitating climate !
On a recent breathless Melbourne night
which had followed a blistering day, about
five dozen (assorted sizes) of Adela Pank-
hurst Walsh’s Socialist pals could think of
nothing better to do than serenade her. She
is serving her sentence in the Women’s
Prison at Coburg, and the 60, tuning up,
gave a manifold imitation of Blondel outside
the-Lion Heart’s prison-tower. “We’ll keep
Australia Free” gathered a crowd; but if
people swarmed like bees, police advanced
like hornets. The angel choir was scattered
and two arrests were made. While bail for
the captives was arriving, the choristers
gave tongue in a little house opposite the
police station. Next day the two who had
been arrested were fined a fiver each. A
month was the alternative, and they took it
out.

Neuralgia aad Sciatica.
The one symptom of neuralgia is pain,
and it is unmistakable.
In a large proportion of cases anaemia and
debility are responsible for neuralgia, parti-
cularly in women. To remedy the neuralgic
condition it is necessary to build up the
blood and improve the general health, and
for this purpose there is nothing better or
more convenient than Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. , . . .
Sciatica is nothing more than neuralgia ol
the sciatica nerve. .
If you have neuralgic or sciatic pains do
not go to great expense for treatment until
you have tried building up the blood. . If you
are pale the chances are very great that the
treatment with Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills is
all that you will require. Hot applications
and liniments may be used at the same time
if you desire. They may relieve the pain,
and temporary relief is the best you can ex-
pect from them anyway. The pain m the
nerve is caused by ner\e staivation. Di.
Williams’ Pink Pills give to the blood the
elements that the nerves need. They con-
tain no narcotics and are not pain-killers.
They remove the cause of the pain.
—A useful booklet, “Building Up
the Blood,” will be sent on application to
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Box 594,

On Face and Body* Could Net
Rest Anywhere. Burning Itch.
Cuticura Completely Healed.
“About four years ago eczema ap-
peared on my daughter. It came in
red blotches on her face and on most
parts of her body. The skin was in-
flamed and dry scales would come. The
agony she endured was terrible. She
could not rest anywhere, as soon as she
would fall off to sleep a burning itch
would commence.
“I heard of Cuticura Soap and Oint-

weeks’ treatment she was completely
healed.” (Signed) A. Shortt, Bundarra

The Inky Way.
“What Happened to Jones” is a detail
compared with what happened to its author
the other day, when the Age presented him
with a baronetcy! The royal George delighted
to honor Edward Broadhurst, a financial
magnate, and the Age promptly announced
that “George Broadhurst, dramatist, would
in future write “Bart.” after his name. No
doubt much less merit has been sentenced to
a title ; but Broadhurst is for practical pur-
poses a Yankee, having left England in his

Died suddenly but peacefully, on Decem-
ber 20, 1017, with a considerate bailiff at
its bedside, the Perth Press Club. It left
goods and chattels valued on paper at
approximately £GOO and liabilities for nearly
the same amount. A voluntary-liquidation
petition has been filed ; but as the late lam-
ented managed to get incorporated under a
Act which was intended to apply only _to
non-trading concerns and makes no provision
for liquidation, it is doubtful if the Court
will agree to this. If it doesn t bankruptcy
seems the only alternative. Thei Club was
started three years ago by 13 of the press
and by taking in outsiders the mem-
bership soon grew to 150. Then a move was
made to more stylish premises, and by the
middle of 1917 yearly receipts had topped
£3OOO Then the price of liquors soared ana
cut into the profits, a number of good
spenders went into camp and others left the
State. As the Club was tied to a bill tor
£ll a week, and had to find for steward s
wages, counter-lunch, lighting and geneia
expenses an additional £l5 to £lB a week,
death came soon, all efforts to build up an
attenuated membership having failed.

“Country Bed”: Owing to numerous
complaints about the increased cost of school-
books, Vic. Education Department is going
to cut off the Supplementary Readers and
revert to standard readers for all grades,

know who are com-

and preparing them
for publication.
The work must be
going on now. Are

“Modesty hath no part in the making of an artist.”
Amazed am I all do not see
A fact that’s ever plain to me —
My marked superiority.
I write the story terse and true,
With rich, red life-blood pouring through.
And lit with humor keen and new ;
Then vainly wait to hear it named
The equal of the world s most famed.
To have my genius acclaimed.
I make some poems sweet and low
Where winged angels come and go,
And vital passions ebb and flow ;
Then wait to feel in touch with mine
The world’s pulse beat with rapture line
Eor those tremendous things I sign,
And see, alas! the whole world wide
Pass by upon the other side,
With others verses occupied.
I set out whimsies quaint and squibs
At which the world might crack its ribs
To win me eminence and dibs,
And see the world sit up and grin
At some mere clowning mannikin.
Obtuseness is man’s grievous sin.
But this I know, I am the best;
Yet hope of triumph loses zest
When one uneasy fact’s expressed:
That when the world's acknowledged me,
No longer quite supreme will be
My unique perspicacity!

THE RAPID HEALER
m
THIS year the dainty foot daintily shod
comes into its own. Never were skirts
shorter or fuller, never were shoes more in
evidence. So the smart woman will hail
with joy the arrival of the new Bostock styles
for the season, since these are more captivating
than ever. The shoe here illustrated, for example,
is typically charming. Out from that most
elegant of materials, patent leather, made in
that new, short-fronted French shape which
makes every foot look so arched and delightful,
this is the shoe of shoes to give a telling finish
to one’s new walking suit or gown. And it is only
one shoe amongst many equally desirable.
Bostock styles now on view at the ieading stores.
Bostock No.
Q 9583
None genuine
unless stamped
“Bostock.”
Unmistakable in style, cut and finish,
and the name “Bostock” on the soles.
IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Mature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes. crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifically prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

The Challenge of the Guns.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COOL and sweet the song of Evening,
fraught with haunting purple glooms,
When the wind with ghostly fingers
stirs C o grasses’ feathery plumes,
Culling Jrcer "c from the censers of the
lionc.. cush-flower blooms;
But above the bushland music, beating, beat-
ing from afar,
I can hear the deeper throbbing of the trum-
pet voice of war,
And the burden of it runs, in the cnalle.ige
of the guns:
“Send your nearest, send your dearest! Send
your sons , send your sons!”
Say the rumbling, grumbling guns. “Send
your sons, send your sons!”
All the bush has subtle music, when the
silver-sandalled Night,
Crowned with mystery and magic, gowned
with robes of pale moonlight,
Softly croons her dreamland runes to speed
the slow-winged stars in flight;
But above the bushland music, beating,
beating from afar,
1 can hear the deeper throbbing of the
trumpet voice of war;
And the burden of it runs in the challenge
of the guns:
“Send your fairest, send your rarest! Send
your sons, send your sons!”
Say the rumbling, grumbling guns. “Send
your sons, send your sons!”
Loud the triumph song of Morning, when
the light begins to flow,
Sweeping back the dim-grey dawning from
the sleeping fields below,
And the magpie, lark and song-thrusli carol
in the early glow ;
But above the bushland music, beating, beat-
ing from afar,
I can hear the deeper throbbing of the trum-
pet voice of war ;
And the burden of it runs, in the challenge
of the guns:
“Send us valor, send us beauty! Send your
sons, send your sons!”
Say the rumbling, grumbling guns. “Send
your sons, send your sons!”
Clamorous the chant of Noonday, pealing
from a heart of gold,
When the. yellow waves of sunlight through
the vibrant bush are rolled,
Beating back from leaf and blossom lined
with colors myriad-fold ;
But through all the bushland music, ringing,
ringing out afar,
I can hear the women’s answer to the trum-
pet voice of war, -
Hear the bushland women’s answer to the
challenge of the guns:
‘ Talce our nearest, take our dearest! Take
our husbands, take our sons!”
And the lovers: “Take the ones who should
father future sons!
Take our tears, take our fears” —oh, the
heart blood faster runs
At the glory of the answer to the challenge
of the guns!

Only for Bill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE room in the slab hut was papered
with sheets of illustrated weeklies, and
had a hardened mud floor. The only
light came from a big log fire, which threw
out waves of flicker. A man with ginger-
grey beard sat smoking on one side of the
fire, and a thin, care-worn, middle-aged
woman sat darning socks opposite. At the
table sat a rather pretty girl. The glow
gave her a really beautiful complexion. Her
eyes lit up when she heard the sharp clatter
of a horse cantering towards the house.
One could say that she had been waiting for
the sound.
“That teamster come again,” said the
man, spitting in the fire.
“Seems he comes often,” said the woman,
with a complaining glance at the girl.
The girl said nothing.
The door opened, and a lithe young fellow
came in quietly, and took a seat by the far
end of the room. He looked ill at ease, as if
he knew that he was not welcome. The
older man gave him a nod of recognition,
and spat in the fire.
“Rather chilly of evenings now,” said the
teamster.
Nobody spoke. The older man smoked
and spat, and the woman went on with her
darning, and the girl began to drum with
her fingers on the table. When she thought
the young man’s eyes were not fixed on her
(which they were nearly all the time) she
stole a quick look at him from under sly eye-
lashes.
“Y here yer camped to-night?” asked the
older man after another spit.
“By Adam’s Crik.”
“Feed good there?”
“No; I had ter put the team in Brown’s
paddock.”
“Didn’t think he’d let yer.”
, ; I strapped down the wires an’ put
em in. He won’t know. I’ll have ’em out
before the mornin’.”
Didn't think yer’d get that fur,” said
the older man. “Yer must have shoved a
bit. It’s 16 mile. Rather fur to ride here
of evenings, anyway.” He added this
meaningly.
I thought it would be a bit lonely at the
camp, said the teamster, simplv.
The girl shot another of those quick
glances at the young man. She then hung
her head, with her face crimsoning.
Conversation lapsed. The older man
knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and filled
and lighted it up again. You coidd hear
him puffing at his pipe, and the girl drum-
ming on the table with her fingers.
Y ish yer’d stop doing that with yer
fingers, said the mother after a time. “It
lair gets on my nerves.”
1 es. mother,” she said, and put her hands
on her lap.
Can t see why yer don’t do something,”
complained the old woman. “Leaving every-
think for me. I’m sure gels nowadays isn’t
what they was in my time.”
“Lovely night outside,” said the teamster.
“Never see such a beautiful moon. I could
have fair written poetry as I come along.”
At this point he seemed to get something
stuck in his throat. It took a minute or two
for him to work it clear.
“Thought yer would like ter see it, Liza.”
The girl looked at the father, and then at
the mother, but both assumed a more than
usually stolid manner, the old man puffing
vigorously at his pipe. The girl looked
irresolute.
“Best time of the day on these frosty
nights,” said the teamster. “It’s a sight
yer shouldn’t miss. I wouldn’t ’ave missed
it for five pounds.”
The girl still sat looking irresolute.
“En I’d like to talk a little business with
you. You see, it will be too fur to come
here again,” he said, and added: “Forty
miles to-morrer night.”
The last words seemed to settle matters.
With a defiant look towards both her parents
she stood up, snatched the wool shawl from
a hook and passed quickly out.
The teamster rose slowly and awkwardly,
as if he were not sure that matters were
progressing amicably all round. He gave
a conciliatory smile towards the old folks,
which they ignored, the man spitting into the
fire more emphatically than ever.
When the young man came out into the
bright moonlight the girl stood with her back
towards him. She did not look round, but
when he approached she began to walk
slowly beside him towards the sliprails,
where the horse was hitched. Neither
seemed to notice the lovely moon, or think
about versifying it. The man found con-
versation awkward. He said:
“Frosts is early this year.”
She “Yes.”
“Makes it hard for ploughin’.”
She said “Yes.”
Then a long silence occurred.
“Didn’t think I’d come along ter-night,
did yer?”
She said “No,” but this was not true.
“Couldn’t help meself, somehow,” he said.
Then he struck another conversational dead
wall. She gave him no help. They were
now leaning on the sliprails, or rather he
was. Her hands rested lightly on them, and
she kept looking away from him.
“I’ve been thinkin’ a lot lately,” he said,
and then waited for her to ask him what
he was thinking about, but she did not speak.
There was a wonderfully serious expression
on her face. Her eyes were luminous in the
moonlight, but she did not let him see that.
Perhaps it was for that she kept looking
away from him.
“I’ve bin thinkin’,” he said, “that it must
be a bit lonely for you livin’ here with the
old people, an’ so far away from other
people.”
lie put his hand towards her arm as if
to take it, but seemed to think better of it.
“There’s plenty to do,” she replied. “It
is never lonely when you have work ter do.”
“But I mean,” he began, and then that
lump came in his throat again and kept him
from speaking a time. “I mean for a nice
girl like you,” he said thickly.
She did not stir. She'did not speak. But
she seemed to tremble.
“I was wonderin’ what ’mu think of me,
Liza?” he asked.
She was very slow in replying.
“I thought you was a nice feller,” she
said. Then she paused, and after a time:
“I was only tellin’ Susie Barnes yesterday
what a nice feller you was.”
At this he mustered up sufficient courage
to lay his hand on her arm. She let it
remain there, to his astonishment.
“Somehow, I don’t think your folks likes
me, Liza.”
“Oh, yes, they do. Mother says yer seem
a decent feller, en father says he s’poses yer
all right, en that’s a lot for him ter say.”
“When I asked you out, Liza, just now,
it was just to let you know ’ow it was with
me. I’ve bin wantin’ since I first saw you
a fortnight ago to tell you ’ow, nice I think
you are, but you was never alone, en to-night
was me larst charnce, en it will be a month
before I’m back on the next trip. Give
me the straight tip, Liza. Do you care for
me?”
Liza gave him a full emotional look, and
then her face fell, flushing blood red. There
was that in her glance which made him fold
her in his arms and kiss her full on the lips.
Then she struggled away from him, and
looked at him with frightened eyes.
“I didn’t oughter,” she said.
“Yes, you ought,” he said emphatically.
“You are mine now.”
“I promised Bill I’d never kiss a feller
any more.” she said. “I promised him last
thing when he went away.”
His face became set and stern, and he
seized her roughly by the arm.
“Who’s this ’ere Bill?” he asked.
“Bill’s me ’usband,” she said. “He’s gone
shearin’.”
He fell back a few paces and seemed to
crumple up.
“Just my luck!” he said. “Liza, I thought
you the nicest girl I ever met. I was never
much on gels till I saw you.”
“Yes,” she said in a whisper. “It seems
a pity, don’t it.”
“Why did you marry him?” he asked bit-
terly.
She was a long time replying. When she
did it was with a sob in her throat. “I
didn’t know there was you then.”
They stood looking at each other, a few
paces still between, and a long silence
occurred. He seemed to be fighting an in-
ward battle.
“Oh, well,” he said, “I s’pose I must be
goin’.”
But he did not go.
“S’pose you’ll call in when you’re pass-
in’.” she asked, “same as usual?”
He held his arms out to h£r as if he
would snatch her to him, and then suddenly
turned away.
“I would, Liza, I would, only—only for
Bill.”
Then he leaped into the saddle and gal-
loped away. And she never stirred till the
sound of bis horse’s hoofs had died away in
the distance.

WOMEN S NEEDLESS KIDNEY SUFFERING
Kidney disease in women often
reaches a serious stage before it is
recognised, because women are apt
to misunderstand the symptoms
and put them down to ‘ ‘ female
troubles ” instead of the real cause
—the kidneys.
When there is kidney trouble
the kidneys and bladder are liable
to become inflamed and to swell
considerably, causing symptoms
which are easily taken for female
complaints—pain or weakness in
the back, dizzy spells, sick head-
aches, the eyes grow dim and puffy,
the ankles and. limbs swell, the
complexion is yellow, you are soon
tired and can’t walk far, you sleep
poorly and feel heavy and languid
in the morning—there may be
urinary disorders and gravel.
With the use of Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills relief will be quick
and lasting, for Doan’s Pills restore
adivity to the kidneys and bladder,
remove inflammation and expel the
kidney poisons which cause women
so much needless suffering. This
medicine has no action on the
bowels. In use 75 years.
'Every Picture
Tells A Story
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all Chemists and Stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or posted on receipt of price by Foster-McClellan
Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
Two Sydney Women
Cured to Stay Cured.
1 FROM PADDINGTON.
Mrs. A. J. Bull, 140 Underwood Street. Pad-
dington, Sydney, says: “A member of my fami .y
was afflicted with backache and kidney disorder
for some time, and was often so bad that it
was almost impossible to get about. Ihe
sharp, shooting pains in the back were very
trying, and never seemed to cease night or day.
Other symptoms were dizzy attacks and a con-
stant tiredness. Hearing Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills very highly spoken of, we decided
to try* them, and it was a lucky thing we heard
of these grand pills, for they worked wonders,
three bottles making a perfect cure. I consider
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills worthy of higb
recommendation.”
Two years later Mrs. Bull says: “The cure
referred to above still holds good, a fact tha
proves Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills to be a
thoroughly reliable remedy.”
j FROM NORTH SYDNEY.
Mrs. J. Welsh, 14 Alfred Street, North Syd-
ney says: “For about two years, off and on,
I suffered with my kidneys and, as a conse-
quence, my health was far from good. My bacK
used to ache fearfully, the pain being often so
severe that I could not stoop or move quicKiy
without suffering agony. Besides backache
felt constantly tired and my legs and ankles
swelled considerably. So much for my heaitn
troubles; now for the medicine that cured me.
After trving different remedies without deriving
any benefit, a friend advised me to take a
course of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and i
am very thankful that I acted on the advic ,
for they cured me completely. That was nine
months ago, and I have had no return of back-
ache and kidney trouble since, so my cure ha
been well tested.”

WHAT wizard wind a changeling
brings
Unto my garden sod,
That where we planted foxglove springs
A golden-rod?
And down November’s yellow aisles
A bird-call comes to me
Like laughter ov.r misty miles
Of lonely sea.
A weed beside my garden gate,
A wild bird in the skies,
The blowing of a wind of fate
Wee golden eyes,
Ye know a path to peaks of blue
Like some white altar-stair
Where there is only God, and two
Dark pines at prayer !
Ye know the hills where afternoon
Hangs like a saffron flame
Above a hidden altar hewn
To Love’s high name.
Ye know a path that twain have trod,
Where Esk goes leaping through—
O golden-rod, my golden-rod !
O hills of blue !
VICTORIA.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
The Release.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ O! OILENCE !”
An uprising of heavy policemen
betokened the arrival of Justice.
Justice was not much to look at. He was
probably representative in his person of the
sort of justice which is dispensed in the
police court. But the formal respect was
not the less observed on that account. The
word “Soilence” went round the court with
urgent whispers to laggard or inexperienced
persons to “Remove that ’at!” or Stand up,
there!” Then, Justice being seated, the
solicitors reseated themselves, the policemen
without special duties to perform sat down,
and the laity fortunate enough to have a
seat seated itself. The prosecuting con-
stable sorted himself out from the ruck. The
deposition-clerk clicked his typewriter; and
the court was open.
By the time I had finished with a hoarse
individual who drew me outside, and tried
to square me about a case of which I knew
nothing, and refused to believe that I was
not a witness for the prosecution, and
appealed piteously to me to “be a sport,
after threatening to have the push on me if
I put him away, the Court had got through
a lot of business. It had dealt with the
drunks. Two of them had signed the pledge,
which for a first offender is the easiest
method to escape without a fine. It had
dealt in a brief fashion with the guilties
and suspended for further treatment the not
guilties.” It had dosed as a police court
and opened as a petty debts court, and i
proceeded to deal with me. Then it closed
as a petty debts court and re-opened as a
police court.
It was an uninteresting day, and nothing
more than the usual happened to show how
great an ass the law is and how wooden-
headed are some of the idiots who dispense
it. A milkman who apparently had, iiKe
Pharaoh’s daughter, drawn a profit from tne
water, was lined heavily to the extent ot
10s ■ and a woman who had taken a parcel
which didn’t belong to her from a grocer s
shop was told to produce a fine of id an l
Os. costs within 48 hours, or go to gaol.
Then Michael Kerrigan was called.
Michael Kerrigan slopped forward and
anticipated things.
“Not guilty, y’ Anner. You see, its this
“We’ll learn all about that,” said his
Anner. , , ,
“Sit down !” commanded the sergeant.
“I never done it, y’ Anner, s’elp me
Gawd !”
“Will you sit down !”
“S’elp me Gawd!” repeated Kerrigan im-
pressively. .. T ~ , lT
“If you don’t sit down,” said Justice, 1
will deal with you for contempt.”
Then Kerrigan subsided. . Although when
the prosecuting sergeant read the charge he
narrowly escaped being “dealt with lor
exclaiming “You’re a liar!” he escaped
because the personification of Justice d d not
catch the remark and accepted an explana-
tion that it was someone else —Michael had
apparently made a practice of despoiling
empty houses of gas-fixtures, coppers, iron
roofs and similar things, and disposing or
them. There was no evidence about it. It
is a remarkable thing that in our police
courts the police are quite frequently allowed
to give their suspicions about accused men
as evidence. But the fact of his having
disposed of a quantity of these things,
amounting in value to £2O-odd, for £4, was
proved by the testimony of the man who pur-
chased them, and the man who lent him the
cart on the day on which the robberies
occurred and the goods were sold, and by
people who had seen the cart in the
vicinity of the rifled houses. Michael s
defence was that he had met a man
—a man with a tanned face and a red mous-
tache, whom he knew as “Ginger” —and this
man knew another bloke (laughter - Order
in the court!”) who had a lot of old cop
pers and iron to dispose of. and that, when
he got the cart, intending to go in for a bit of
dealing. Ginger had met him and introduced
him to the man-—name was Smith—who had
taken him to a vacant lot and filled his cait.
“I sold the stuff, y’ Worship, but s’elp me,
I didn’t know it was stolen. I gave the
money ter Smith, and I haven’t been paid
meself yet. Smith said he’d pay me when the
cheque was cashed.” _
“The cheque was open,” said the prosecut-
ing sergeant.
“So help me Gawd!” said Kerrigan, im-
pressively. He had an undying belief in the
power of the phrase. He looked at Justice.
It was referring to notes with a pretence of
understanding them, while it waited for the
deposition-clerk to present a copy of the
evidence. He looked at the prosecuting ser-
geant, who was sorting out his papers for
the next case. He looked towards the re-
porters. There was only one, and he
was considering how “Kerrigan’s Ivurious
Kapers” would look as a headline. And
Kerrigan uttered again, “So help me Gawd!”
“Witnesses?”
Kerrigan had no witnesses. He relied on
the look of celestial innocence he tried to
assume.
“Cross-examination ?”
“You say this man’s name was Smith?”
“Smith —s’elp me Gawd !”
“Where did Smith cash this cheque?”
“With some bloke, I don’t know his name,
s’elp me Gawd !”
“Don’t say that.” said Justice severely,
for the half-dozenth time. “It’s blasphemy.
You’re on your oath; that will do. Don’t
use the words again!”
“I won’t, y’ Worship, s’elp me Gawd, I
won’t, then!”
The cross-examination concluded with
Kerrigan still calling upon the Almighty to
s’elp him.
“Previous convictions?” queried Justice.
“None,” admitted the police. “But the
accused consorts with bad characters, and
has been under suspicion for some time.”
It was one of those loose statements that
are submitted in the police-courts without
any evidence in support; and Kerrigan did
not know enough to point out that parsons
mix with bad characters sometimes, and that
now and again- an absolutely honest man mixes
with Prime Ministers and other members of
Parliament. It probably wouldn’t have
helped him much, anyhow; he had elected
to be dealt with summarily, and the man
who fined a milk-and-water man ten shillings
dealt with him as summarily as the neces-
sary dissertation on the ungodliness of
offences against property would allow.
“Luckily for you, it is a first offence,”
concluded Justice, severely. “Five pounds or
thirty days’ hard labor.”
“Time?” said the stunned Michael.
“No time!” said Justice, sharply. “Next
Ca ßut while Kerrigan, protesting that he
was “ennercent,” was being removed, a
woman’s voice rose in a wail.
“Yer Anner, yer Anner, he’s me ’usband,
a good ’usband, too, and ’e’s me sole sup-
port an’ the support of me childer. An’ if
’e goes to gaol, yer Anner, we’ll starve. ’E’s
bein’ led away, yer Anner, that’s what ’e
’as —led away by propogate companions.”
A worn but neatly-dressed woman, sobbing
excitedly, had burst from the back of the
court, and the end of her discourse landed
her as near to the bench as she could get. _
“Who is this woman?” inquired Justice
with asperity.
“She’s Kerrigan’s wife,” explained the
police. “A hardworking, respectable woman.”
“Yes, an’ there’s five childer, yer Anner,
and their father going to gaol means they’ll
starve. ’E’s a good man, truly, yer Anner:
Vs bin misled! For the love of ’Eaven, yer
Anner, let him off! ’E was a ’ardworking
man till the union made the strike”
"Was he in a strike?” Justice.
“’E was, yer ’Anner, but he’s left the
union, and ’e’s bin out of work since,” she
said, pacified by a hope that Justice was
relenting.
“My good woman,” said Justice, “your
husband has been convicted, and nothing can
be done. If the fine is paid”
“Oh, yer Anner,” wailed Mrs. Kerrigan,
“an’ where am I to get five pound from —me
with me ’elpless children! For the love of
’Eaven, yer Anner —’e was a good man, an
a good ’usband. An’ a good father, too; if
he ’adn’t been, he”
“My good woman,” began Justice, per-
turbed.
“Y’ Worship,” said- the smartest police-
court solicitor, seizing the opportunity, as
the smartest police-court solicitor knows
how, “perhaps, before the court closes, the
fine may be I myself am pre-
pared”
“Very well, Mr. Longtongue,” said Jus-
tice, and he proceeded to hold out hope to
Mrs. Kerrigan, while someone at the solici-
tors’ table started a collection. The police-
prosecutor gave five shillings. The police
made a collection amongst themselves and
the audience. One of the solicitors who
knew me drew me into the matter.
That was one of the bright moments of
my life. I noticed that the unforgiving credi-
tor who was responsible for my presence had
lingered, like myself, to hear the case. I took
my solicitor friend over and told my creditor
that if he liked to give ten shillings I would
give five. lie was glorying in the verdict a
foolish magistrate had given him by cutting
the difference between what he claimed and
what I admitted I owed ; and he didn’t real-
ise at that time the hollow thing a verdict
(which costs six shillings to obtain) really
is. He reckoned that coming from a loser
my offer was generous ; while I gloated over
the fact that in addition to the money that
he had sacrificed by taking me to court, my
antagonist was going to pay ten shillings for
his morning’s enjoyment.
Longtongue, my friend and myself were
able to go to Mrs. Kerrigan with the good
news and the cash, and the fine was paid.
The poor woman in piteous language ren-
dered her thanks; and we went with her
and the released husband outside the court.
He was not as exuberant in his gratitude
as his wife. In fact, he did not appear to
be certain about being grateful at all. We
watched them as they went up the street.
By the time the corner was reached the
woman’s piteousness had left her. She was
a volcano of wrath in full eruption.
“I’ve got you now !’’ she screamed at him,
filling her hands with blue-metal. “Think I
wanted yer for yerself, yer loafing carcase,
yer! I wanted ter ’ave it out with yer
before I cooled! Got that money, did yer,
an’ never even brought ’ome a bottle o’
beer! Where’s the money, ye brute —what
’ave yer done with it?”

“Indispensable”
—a word largely used in these days—may be said to accurately express,
in so far as any single word can, what is the careful and considered
conclusion which has been arrived at by many people^ who use
Beeeham’s Pills. They consider that Beecham’s Pills are indispen-
sable ” to their health, and, as a matter of course, to their happiness;
and they never allow themselves to be without a supply of this valuable
medicine in their homes. This latter is an excellent idea, and one
worthy of imitation—for there is no doubt whatever, that, as a preven-
tive medicine^ —one that may be taken with confidence when perhaps
only an “out of sorts” feeling is experienced and before any definite
ailment has developed-Beecham’s Pills are a positive boon. They do
good all round;- they i one up the stomach, correct the action of the
liver, regulate the bowels and are a powerful agent' in purifying the
blood It is certainly a good plan never to be without
