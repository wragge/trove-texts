Perchance upon some grieving, green-browed
hill
That droops its head towards the sorrowing
sea
May stir her shadowy fingers tenderly
Amongst the dew that little grasses spill;
Or maybe there is many an Irish street
That, thinking of her sadness and delight,
Hears still her voice low-whispering to the
night,
And knows the quiet comfort of her feet.
O Dreamer, spinning glory for your land!
O Rebel, daring greatly for your dream !
O Poet, tossing beauty on the air !
Rest sweetly. There are stars within your

The wild geese have come home; and, see,

Of your young tears that glimmer in God’s

PAMELA TRAVERS.
The Bi-Centenary of Certain Books
Calculating from the date of its publica-
tion, “Robinson Crusoe” was two hundred
years old on April 25, 1919 ; and the Times
published a Literary Supplement, regretting
that the fame of the book had overshadowed
that of its author. Said the critic: —
When the editor of the Christian World, in the
year 1870, appealed to “the boys and girls of Eng-
land” to erect a monument upon the grave of Defoe,
which a stroke of lightning had mutilated, the marble
was inscribed to the memory of the author of “Robin-
son Crusoe.” No mention was made of “Moll
Flanders.” Considering the topics which are dealt
with in that book, as in “Roxana,” “Captain Single-
ton,” “Coaonel Jack” and the rest, we need not be
surprised, though we may be indignant, at the omis-
sion. On any monument worthy of the name of monu-
ment the names of “Moll Flanders” and “Roxana,”
at least, should be carved as' deeply as the name of
Defoe.
This pronouncement but revoices Charles
Lamb’s “Estimate of Defoe’s Secondary
Novels,” in which the “gentle Elia” declares
that “in the appearance of truth, in all the
incidents and conversations that occur in
them, they exceed any works of fiction that
I am acquainted with.” He grants in full
the remarkable appeal of “Robinson Cru-
soe” ; but acclaims four other fictitious narra-
tives by Defoe as possessing an interest
not inferior to that of the immortal desert-
islander —“Roxana,” “Captain Singleton,”
“Moll Flanders” and “Colonel Jack.” For
my own part I would place at the head of
the list “A Journal of the Plague Year,”
with a place of honor farther down for
“Memoirs of a Cavalier.”
If we grant the critical exactitude of
Charles Lamb’s valuation of what are called
Defoe’s “secondary novels,” 1719 was but
the beginning of an epoch of first-rate produc-
tivity, which lasted for six years, and did
not close until “Roxana” was published in
1724, during which period Defoe produced
all' his notable fictions, namely, “Rob.nson
Crusoe” (1719), “Memoirs of a Cavalier”
and “Captain Singleton” (1720), “Moll
Flanders,” “Colonel Jack” (or “Jacque”)
and “A Journal of the Plague Year” (1 < 22),
and “The Fortunate Mistress” —the original
title of “Roxana” —(1724). So if the first
of the series be worthy of commemorating,
those possessing “an interest not inferior to
‘Robinson Crusoe’ ” should each have its
individual celebration.
“Robinson Crusoe” need detain us for
only a moment. Everybody read it, and it
served as a model for many imitations.
Nearly a hundred years after it was pub-
lished, Dr. Itodolphe Wyss, tutor to the
children of the Humboldt family, wrote “The
Swiss Family Robinson” for the purpose of
teaching his pupils zoology and botany.
Dumas must have read it with enthusiasm ;
no part of “Monte Cristo” is more enthrall-
ing than that dealing with the Abbe’s con-
quest of the material obstacles in the
Chateau D’lf.
“Memoirs of a Cavalier” was Defoe’s
next important book; and it was pronounced
by Chatham to be the most realistic picture
of the England of the Great Rebellion of any
he knew. The same year saw “Captain
Singleton,” remarkable for the anticipated
discovery by Sir John Franklin of the North-
West Passage; and for a guess which turned
out to be correct, as to the existence of the
lake-system of the Nile sources in Central
Africa. The book has been very cavalierly
treated by those whom I might designate as
“costume" critics,” dilettanti of the arm-
chair, who classify literature according to
the clothes of a period, and who cannot con-
ceive a difference in the moral point of view
from one age to another. To these Captain
Singleton was an impossibly humane pirate,
who did very objectionable things, but who
always talked like a respectable Englishman
with an eye to the main chance. But piracy
was near akin to aristocracy, to say nothing
of royalty; and p’racy and slave-catching
generally went together. Sir John Hawkins,
whom Queen Elizabeth made a knight, was
that Sovereign’s partner in his second voyage,
and he was also the first English slave-cap-
tain. Sir Walter Raleigh lost his head be-
cause he was an unsuccessful gentleman
pira<te who did not bring home the promised
booty to his lord and master, King James
1., a monarch, by the way, who, in 1018,
chartered a slave-trading company.
If Defoe had never written any other
book but “A Journal of the Plague Year”
he would deserve an enduring niche in the
pantheon of English literature. It is a ter-
rible picture of an awful visitation, and
every word of it is true! As a work of
sheer art, it rivals nothing but stark Nature
itself. Moreover, it reveals the secret of De-
foe’s genius as nothing else he wrote reveals
it, although Leslie Stephen wastes 63 pages
of a printed essay to discover what that
secret was, and concludes without coming
to a conclusion. Perhaps he did not want to
do so. Leslie Stephen hated journalists, and
never lost an opportunity of insu’tmg the pro-
fession. Now, Defoe was the Father of Jour-
nalism, and the greatest journalistic realist
that ever lived. He founded the Review,
a journal of society, and kept it going for
nine years (1704-13) with his own pen—two
numbers a week for the first year, and three
numbers a w ; eek subsequently. He wrote,
besides, pamphlets, the newspapers of the
period. He wrote histories, travels, statis-
tics, speculative theories, lampoons, libels,
biographies,' political tracts, accounts of
apparitions, witchcraft, magic, demonology
and everything that a man of that epoch
could possiblv write about; he even wrote a
“Political History of the Devil,” and books
of instruction on the “Compleat English
Tradesman”' and the “Compleat English
Gentleman.” He knew everything that could
ever be learnt about journalism, for he him-
self tells us :• —-
No man hath tasted differing fortunes more,
For thiiteen times have I been rich and poor.
He wrote “The Shortest Way with the Dis-
senters,” and the crassly stupid generation
in which he lived and tried to earn his crust
put him in the pillory, cropped his ears and
sent him to gaol; and there he met Moll Flan-
ders and Roxana.
Leslie Stephen calls Defoe “a liar,” and
adds, quite gratuitously, “a word for which
there is, unfortunately, no equivalent which
does not imply some blame.” But he also
calls him “a journalist,” with vituperative
energy, and appears to imply that there is
very little difference between the two. And
it is to be noted that Defoe is “a liar”
precisely because he had the most marvellous
power ever known of giving verisimilitude
to his fictions —and then comes the gratui-
tous insult—“or, in other words again, he
had the most amazing talent on record for
telling lies.” One feels inclined to add, “In
other words again, the greater the artist the
greater the liar,” and the phrase fits, not
only the novelist, but the poet, the dramatist,
the actor ; in short, the practitioner of any
form of illusory art.
The secret of Defoe’s power is, I think,
to be found in his possession, to a unique
degree, of a superlative journalistic capacity
for combining and co-ordinating items of
fact and folly, of fancy and rumor, con-
ceived by many minds, told by many mouths
and experienced by many men. He had a
supreme power of selection, and fused the
multitudinous stories of a myriad into the
coherent narrative of one. The something
more that Defoe possessed was a mental
projection, or spiritual translation, what you
will, into the very middle of the incidents
with which he surrounds himself as Robin-
son Crusoe, as the London sojourner during
the Plague Year, as Colonel Jack, as Moll
Flanders, as the Cavalier of the Memoirs, as
Captain Singleton, as Roxana. He is jn
truth the Turk with the magic carpet, and
goes whithersoever his fancy taketh him.
FRED J. BROOMEIELD.
Dostoievsky
The lure of the French bookstall! Who
can resist it, with tables flaunting titles
created to arrest the passer-by ? Nearly all
the books are in those familiar canary-color
paper covers so dear to the French reader. But
there is something still more alluring to the
lover of letters, and that is a band which en-
circles a book, bearing the piinted phrase
“Fieri t de paraUre ” —Just out. One is seized
with curiosity. The book is picked up;
handled ; the 7 francs 50 passed to the attend-
ant. Thus it was that in one recent day
four intensely interesting books came into my
possession in the Boulevard des Italiens.
All are worth while; but Andre Gide’s
“Dostoievsky” calls you back and back again.
Gide’s criticism, though somewhat diffuse, and
very much a vehicle (as the French way is)
for the author’s own ideas on many subjects
outside the text, is absorbing. He seems to
have penetrated into the secret places of the
great Russian’s heart. “One expects to find
a god; one touches a man.”
At the outset we get much of the real per-
son of the author of “The Brothers Kara-
mazov,” from an accumulated mass of pri-
vate letters, all of which show the pains-
taking methods and the high purpose of a
poor sick man whose ideal was Perfection.
“A long patience”—if ever the humble word
of Buffon had its right place, it was when
applied to Dostoievsky. “What theory is
yours, my brother, that a picture should be
painted straight off? Since when have you
been persuaded of that? Believe me, it is
necessary to work and work enormously.
Believe me that a verse of I’ouchkine, how-
ever light and elegant it appears, is only so
because of the constant repolishing. We’re
told that one finds but few corrections in
Shakspeare’s manuscripts. It is piecisely for
that reason there are so many deformities
and so much lack of taste in his works. If
he had worked harder he would have been
better.” Thus the Russian writes to his
brother. This is the .tone of his entire cor-
respondence—work, work, one must work.
And the incessant demand for money. He
asked without ruse, without pride, without
ironaAk He was always in want. Towards
the of his life, intoxicated as it were
with that humility with which he knew so
well how to endow his heroes—that strange
Russian humility which is at the bottom of the
soul of every Russian, who can never under-
stand why we Westerners make of dignity a
virtue—he naively remarks, “Why do they
refuse me, especially when I beg so humbly?”
But he never created for money. “I have
taken an oath that, come what may, I shall
never write to order. The command kills. I
want each of my works to stand and endure
for its own sake.” He had all his life the
unhappy conviction that, with more time and
liberty, he would have done better work.
Who knows? A greater simplicity, perhaps;
a more perfect subordination of details.
“There are moments of inspiration,” he
writes to his brother, who has evidently been
reproaching him for his scanty output. “You
confound inspiration—that is, the first crea-
tive thought—with the work. For example,
I write a scene at once, as it appears to me!
I’m enchanted with it. But for months
after, and even for years, I work on it.”

For 12 years the idea of “The Brothers
Karamazov” fermented in his head.
All the well-known incidents of the novel
ist’s life are touched upon—Siberia, hi•mar-
riages his sojourn abroad, and Ins epilep y.
Apropos of his malady, Dostoievsky was
frightened that his memory and hisnma;gina
tion were becoming enfeebled. At 08, tw
rears before his death, he wrote .1 av
remarked that the older I grow the more
difficult my work becomes. In consequence,
black and terrible thoughts oppress me.
But he never wavered in his faith that ltn
sia was to be the saviour of Europe, capable
of putting herself at the head of the com-
mon cause of humanity.” Speaking or
Pouchkine, he praised him for Ins faculty oi
universal sympathy, then added: lhis apti-
tude he shares in common with our people.
It is this quality that makes him our national
poet.” He regarded the Russian soul as
a territory of conciliation” between the. vari-
ous European tendencies, and exclaimed.
“Where is the true Russian who does not
think first of Europe?” And he even pro-
duced this astonishing phrase: "The Russian
vagabond has need of universal happiness to
be at peace with himself.”
Gide’s book is for the French, and he makes
considerable references to French authors,
especially Balzac, contrasting the different
psychology of the two writers. One observa-
tion : “Let us say that the ‘Comddie
Humaine’ of Balzac is born of contact of the
Evangel with the Latin spirit; the Russian
comedy of Dostoievsky of the contact of the
New Testament and Buddhism with the
Asiatic spirit.” But, though written for the
French, the wandering spirit of William
Blake, whom Gide calls “that great English-
man,” hovers over all the book. He quotes
many of Blake’s proverbs to show the analogy
of thought between these two giants. For
instance, he is very impressed with
Blake’s postulate, “Energy is the only
life. Energy is eternal delight. Attrac-
tion and repulsion, reason and energy,
love and hate are equally necessary to the
human existence. Separate them, and you
annihilate existence.” The Frenchman says
that Dostoievsky appropriates Blake’s ideas
without knowing of them ; all his characters
groan and travail under these dual emotions.
He devotes a whole chapter to this parallel.
He is discussing Dostoievsky’s “L’Esprit
Souterrain,” which he classes as a monologue.
He resists the claim that James Joyce, the
author of “Ulysses,” is the inventor
of this form of literature. “What
of Dostoievsky? What of E. A. Poe? And,
above all, what of Browning?” He finds
Browning and the Russian have much in
common —the style, the form of their work
and the undying optimism of each according
to his temperament. A key he gives us to
open all Dostoievsky’s works, that terrible
difference between humility and humiliation,
a difference which causes so much tragedy
not only in Russian books, but in everyday
life everywhere. Humility opens the gates
of Paradise; humiliation, those of Hell.
There is an incident told of an interview be-
tween Turgenieff and Dostoievsky. The latter
had committed an offence, gross and carnal,
which, in a moment of religious exaltation,
he wanted to confess. To whom better could
he go than to Turgenieff, whose works
breathed reconciliation and love, and who,
true to his romances, would naturally forgive
and embrace the sinner? The sin was con-
fessed, Dostoievsky adding: “I must tell you,
Turgenieff, that I despise myself profoundly.”
He waited. No reply. He waited still. Not
a word from the great Turgenieff. Being
unable to contain himself any longer, Dos-
toievsky rushed out of the room exclaiming,
“But I despise you still more.” Humility
offended, brusquely converted into humilia-
tion ! Many of his books have their origin
in this mutilated humbleness. “Humilies et
Offenses” is the title of one of his earliest
books; and the strangest and most disquiet-
ing character in all his works, the terrible
Stavroguine (Possessed), is explained only
thus. His mother said of him: “My son
is a proud man, ivhose pride has been pre-
maturely wounded.”
LUTE DRUMMOND.
An Anthology by Australians
The multiplication of anthologies is one
of the literary features of our time. Ever
since Palgrave, with the valuable assistance
of Tennyson, produced his “Golden
Treasury,” scholars and men of letters have
been eager to direct the general reader by
their own standards of taste; and the general
reader, eager to read much that is best, and
despairing of ever reading the whole, has
been an easy prey. To know writers by
anthology selections is to know them very
poorly; but it is probably better than to
know them only by the names and covers of
their books. Still, the anthology, however
beautiful as a book, is something of a crime
against the spirit of letters in that it re-
moves work from its setting and puts it in
the frame that is least suitable. The taste,
too, of the selectors is apt to mislead stu-
dent readers; in almost every anthology one
will find side by side two writers one of
whom at his best is by no means the peer of
the other at his worst. As a handy book
from which well-seasoned readers may refresh
old memories or carry with them in small
compass a few of the poems or prose passages
they like best, almost every anthology issued
can be strongly defended; but as guides to
the uninitiated the very best are of doubtful
value.
The latest addition to the Oxford Press
books, English Verse and Prose, a new an-
thology edited by Archibald T. Strong, of
the University of Adelaide, and R. S. Wal-
lace, of the University of Melbourne, was
originally intended to accompany, by way of
affording illustrations, an extensive work by
the selectors covering the whole field of Eng-
lish literature. If we had the running com-
ment of such a volume to guide us it might
help to explain some of the peculiarities of
this anthology. That it is in the main a
very fine English book may go without ques-
tion. Many of the short prose passages are
excellently chosen ; and as a general survey
of the growth of our literature it would be
hard to beat. But in places it hardly main-
tains a just proportion. Thus the editors
may be right in thinking that the veise of
Sir Walter Scott is so much more important
than his prose that they do not give a single
extract from the latter, but it seems strange
that Scott should be represented by seven
pages of verse while Mrs. Browning gets
only a single page, and Robert Louis Steven-
son less than a page for both prose and verse.
It is surely a pity that there should be but
one extract from Thackeray—and that cei-
tainly not the best that could have been
chosen —while John Ruskin is allowed turee.
Matthew Arnold is rightly allowed large
space for both prose and verse; but Christina
Rossetti is dismissed with a third of a page.
It seems strange, too, that, where so many
modern writers of small measure are allowed
a place, with these Australian professors no
Australian need apply. To say that there
is nothing in the work produced on this con-
tinent comparable with that of Flecker, Gren-
fell and Owen is ridiculous; yet that is just
the impression Professors Strong and W al-
lace convey. If Australian professors of
literature ignore their own, the public natu-
rally accepts the notion that it is ignored
because it is no good.
For the part of the book dealing with the
growth of our literature from the fourteenth
to the end of the seventeenth century there
can be nothing but praise; the selections of
the 18th century seem to be chosen for the
requirements of the class-room rather than
on their relative literary merits; but the last
and present centuries are dealt with a little
capriciously. Great allowance must always
be made in'an anthology for individual taste;
and the book judged as a whole is a beautiful
companion for a quiet hour. It is as a guide
to the student searching for what is best
that it is not always convincing in its choice.

Technique
Chelsea is notoriously a place of vogues
and catchwords. George Lambert has re-
cently arrived from that part of the world,
and so we got this in a Sydney newspaper
from him the other day:—
Secret of success? Technique is a very great part
of it. What do you think makes Rodin, for instance,
so much greater than the next man ? Why, his
extraordinary technique ! To me the works in which
his technical skill is so bounteously displayed are
far greater than those others in which his imagina-
tion ranged unrestrained. Unrestrained genius is
just as inimical to art as the lack of any genius.
There is a well-known story about Oscar
Wilde complaining of weariness as the result
of an over-strenuous day. “What did you do
in the morning?” inquired a sympathetic
friend. “Put a comma into my new play.
“And in the afternoon?” “Took it out
again.” Technique is style, and style is said
to be the man. But, as in the case ot
Wilde and many another, it is usually not
the man but an artificiality laboriously built
up to represent the man as he wishes the
world to see him. Artificiality can be art,
of course, but it is never big art; and often
it is extremely trivial art.
I take literature for the purpose of my
point because, while we all read and many
of us write, only a negligible few are con-
cerned w T ith the graphic arts.
How many of the great poets, novelists or
essayists were technicians or stylists to a
pre-eminent or even noticeable extent.
Taine ranks Byron as one of England's
supreme poets. “Don Juan,” in a sense
Byron’s masterpiece, is as faulty from a
technical standpoint as any work of art
could well be. Sublime bursts of song are
interspersed with doggerel of which the
humblest London Punch contributor might
be ashamed. In craftsmanship the poem
cannot be compared, as a whole, to Gilbert
Frankau’s "One of Us,” much less to “The
Sentimental Bloke.” The reason is plain.
“I write,” remarked Byron, “as the tiger
springs.” ■ He could not correct, sub-edit,
watch his every step, and if he had been able
to —if he had thought more of his technique
and less of lyricism—it is jirobable that
the world would have lost in deathless poetry
what it gained in cold. form. The plays of
Shakspeare are technically admirable from
an actor’s standpoint: Shakspeare happened
to have been an actor. But as completed
works of art most of them are open to criti-
cism. Shakspeare had a hearty contempt,
of technique per se. It is said that when
one of his dramas was found not to play
sufficiently long for the taste of the audience
he would withdraw’ to a quiet spot, and
there and then carpenter on to the work 10
or 20 minutes of dialogue containing im-
perishable gems of fantasy and wit. The
story may be apocryphal, but the plays lend
color to it. A kind of tremendous and god-
like casualness is of the very marrow of
them. Could anything be more chaotic than
a Dickens novel? Of all Dickens’s work the
most formless is “Pickwick Papers.” Yet
from this rambling series of travel notes,
without a beginning and without an end, has
emerged one of the most vital creations in
the world’s literature. Said Father Knox,
the Jesuit wit: “I always picture a new
arrival in Heaven looking round and saying:
‘Well, and where is Pickwick?’” A just
tribute to the great Cockney writer’s genius,
and a sound piece of criticism. Which of
the writers who were primarily occupied
with technique, form, style, method and exe-
cution could have earned anything like it
from a competent and conscientious reader?
Our literature has had self-conscious tech-
nicians in every age. The Restoration
period swarmed with them. A luxuriant
crop appeared in the closing years of' the
19th century, when the “Yellow Book”
flourished and Gilbert created Bunthorne.
But an unfailing characteristic of all of them
was smallness: the most eminent were what
the French call “little masters.” Ten people
to-day enjoy the spacious and naif poetry of
the Elizabethan era for every one that loves
the modern and correct work of Pope. Ste-
venson, wfio polished so assiduously, would
be dead but for “Treasure Island,” which he
was not given time to polish. Wilde, the
super-technician of the Victorian age, sur-
vives in one or two comedies and a ballad
in which, having been purged of affectation
by suffering, he let technique slide and was
as unorthodox and unexpected as Coleridge
at his best and most effective. Henry
James, Meredith, Browning, Macaulay, Car-
lyle—all those who tended to put the form
in which they expressed the thing before the
thing itself, have to that extent handicapped
themselves in the race for immortality. To
a generation which did not personally know
their voices, so to speak, they have become not
only difficult to read but as irritating as any
less gifted type of affected character might
be.
A pernicious effect of the modem Chelsea
school’s insistence on the supreme import-
ance of technique is that it tends to Hood
the marts of art with duds and posturers.
The literary artist who is “capable of writ-
ing beautifully about a broomstick” is, in
nine cases out of ten, an empty-headed ass
vvho writes of broomsticks because he knows
little or nothing of anything else. The man
with something to say, whether he is a
Thackeray or a Thomas Hardy, a Burns or
a Henry Lawson, will find his own method
of saying it without much reference to rules
or forms: the type who thinks of form first
and matter afterwards, and who embarks on
the sea of art with those convictions, is
nearly always a good grocer or haberdasher
gone wrong.
MARAUD SAFRAN.
Secret Poets
Recent writers on the Red Page strike a
pessimistic note on the subject of poets and
their chances of reaching an audience. But
David McKee Wright’s article, “Secret
Poetry,” suggests to me one thing that will
help to find a public for our Australian verse-
books. Mr. Wright takes Hugh McCrae to
task for publishing in such a manner that
his poetry can be bought only by collectors
of Norman Lindsay’s work, and asks, “What
has Australia done that her poets hide their
work from her and give it to collectors only?”
This makes me ask: What has Australia
done that her poets hide themselves from
her? Furnley Maurice wails about the
want of a public, and charges it chiefly to
the fact that advertising is so expensive.
Who are the best known, if not the most
widely read, writers or poets of Australia?
Probably Henry Lawson and Mary Gilmore;
and they spent little or nothing on advertis-
ing. Henry Lawson was known throughout
the length and breadth of Australia. It
matters not one- whit that the public knew
of his failings as well as of his poetry. That
just showed that, although one of the Great
Ones, he was as other men are. Jim Grahame
hit the nail on the head when he wrote (B.
14/6/’23) :—•
The women of hut and tent and camp
Are in Mary Gilmore’s ken;
For she knows the lives of the bushmen’s wives
As our Lawson knew the men.
Lawson and Mary Gilmore know and are
known. That is the whole secret. It is
the personal touch—the knowledge of little
intimate incidents in the everyday life of
our writers that endears them to the average
man and woman, and the world is made up
mostly of average men and women. Per-
haps our Australian writers are at fault in
hiding themselves. Perhaps they despise
the average man and woman because these
are so very average. Yet the average per-
son makes up the great bulk of Australian
readers, who are the potential buyers of Aus-
tralian verse.
The average reader of poetry knows some-
what more of the poems of Rupert Brooke,
Edward Thomas or Siegfried Sassoon than
he (or she) does of, say, Edward Shanks,
John Freeman or Sturge Moore, and that
mainly because the death of the former
brought their personality and their work
more prominently into the public view. This
does not mean that people wait till a man
is dead before they read his books, but rather
that a poet is at fault in hiding his person-
ality from the public. “Old Parson Hawker,
of Morewenstow,” was to me merely a name,
even though I had seen his rectory with the
quaint chimney-tops, until one day I stood
inside his hut on the edge of the Cornish
crags and listened to the mighty thunders
of the Atlantic waves lashing the rocks
below. All Arthurian legends were of little
account to me—till I spent a day wandering
round Tintagel. It is the intimate converse
of “R.L.S.’s” books that endears him to the
average reader. His books with the personal
bits are read more widely than his stories
or his poems.
In Australia we lack the intimate work
of such writers as Katherine Tynan and
many another, who have made some of the
newer poets live for us, as no amount of
acquaintance with their writings alone
would have done. “Dear K.T.,” as all her
friends seem to call her, has drawn for me
an ineffaceable picture of Francis Thomp-
son in mustard-colored garments, with his
old clay pipe and opium habits, and the
pranks played upon him by the Meynell
children. I knew little of Francis Thomp-
son, and I have always hated mustard-
colored suits and clay pipes, but I loved
“K.T.’s” intimate way of writing of the
Great Ones, and it was not long before l
became possessor of “The Hound of Heaven.”
In the same way W. B. Yeats, Lionel John-
son, Mrs. Meynell and Viola, Dora Sigerson
and many another sweet singer lives for me.
It is the personal element that does it.
Those familiar little articles and photos in
the literary press of the homeland have made
those poets seem real men and women.
What do I know of Furnley Maurice’s poets
save one or two? Nothing! Are they tall
or short, fat or thin? Do they boast a ziff?
Are they superstitious about black cats? Do
they take sugar or salt with their porridge,
smoke clays or wear mustard-colored pants?
I do not know. Nor do I know any one
thing about any one of them (being only an
average up-country woman), and so I never
buy one of their books. But I do know
about Henry Lawson, Paterson and Mary
Gilmore and others, including Nina Murdoch
and Zora Cross, and I have often gone out
of my way to buy their books, not because I
think their poetry is better than that of
Wright, McCrae, etc., but because of the
tiniest element of personal interest. Who
will be our Australian Katherine Tynan
and make Wright, McCrae, Wilcox and co.
living entities to the average man and
woman who never skip the poetry pages of
The Bulletin?

“5.E.0.”: “Hamer’s” “Metaphorical Menagerie”
(B. 27/9/’23) doesn’t beat the performance of the
sheep-breeders’ chairman at their last banquet. “Are
we such worms that we will stand our beards being
pulled without making a kick?” he said while
dealing with squatters’ grievances.


One buyer
may make
a mistake—
But not 110.000!
Over one hundred and ten thousand motorists
registered a preference for Studebaker motor
cars last year.
And now this year, an even greater number of
buyers are turning to Studebaker — 81,880
Studebaker cars having been sold during the
first six months of 1923! Never before in
Studebaker’s history of 71 years has such manu-
facturing activity been achieved.
That the buying public has been quick to recog-
nize a good product is proved by the world-wide
popularity of Studebaker automobiles. In fairness
to yourself you should see the twelve Studebaker
models before you buy.

WHY A PACKARD?
PACKARD FACTORY
ACK ARD has set up a series of tests and processes which
are well nigh fastidious. The stethoscope test of all the motors
before being released for final assemblage; the infinitesimal
measurements to which hundreds of different parts must
exactly conform and the scientific examination of all raw
materials, are indicative of the thorough qualities which gov-
ern Packard workmanship.
What is the result of all this painstaking care ? To what end
is this jealous guarding of a standard among so many men ?
It is nothing less than the production of such a car as Packard
has built in the newest Single-Six.
The blending of smart style and authentic taste in the latest model of the Packard Single-Six is a triumph
that cannot be separated from the Packard standard of workmanship nor found anywhere outside the course
of Packard progress.
That quiet, smooth and flexible engine action which sets the Single-Six apart from its kind has no other
origin than these exacting limits and their scrupulous fulfilment.
The final justification of all the cost and all the care devoted to its building, is written in the performance of
this car. It joins economy to power; it unites safety with speed ;it balances light weight with riding ease;
and by both its freedom from defect and its special provision for the easy maintenance of all its qualities, it
gives promise of serviceable life through many years.
It was to ensure performance of this character and quality that this car was built so finely and so well. How
greatly its builders have succeeded in their work, you may learn from the men and women who own and
drive it. They say : "The Packard Single-Six is not a car —-it is the car.”

Breathing the seeping mist,
Tramping a world pearl-grey,
Feeling your hand on my wrist.
What did we talk of then?
Nothing at all. Soul-wise,
We swung through the sodden glen
With neither laughter nor sighs.
Never the song of a bird,
Nor the perfume of flower,
Nor the ineffectual word,
To dim the thought of the hour !
Oh, some find Love in the Spring,
Some under stars are kissed !
But I found my love ’mid the sting
Of the wind and a Southland mist!

Here one cracked pane reflects the desolate
Flight of a bird that seeks its absent mate.
There is some haunting whisper all around
That tells of thwarted hones and dreams
distraught.
Some presence with a lifetime’s longing
fraught.
So strong and passionate, long held and

Within these rooms —the strange, unrestful
breath
Of some emotion far too strong for death.
Once this door creaked beneath a 'firm,
brown hand,
Once a fresh, freckled, childish face peeped
through ;
Out on the bare verandah lovers true
Gazed far across this same drought-stricken
land,
Forgetting toil of the hot afternoon
’Neath the calm benediction of the moon.
Only the wind comes now to sigh and mourn,
Stirring the dusty leaves upon the trees,
Shaking loose bark in doleful bielodies,
And dreaming of long yellow rows of corn
Where once it rustled through hot, summer

Kissing the upturned faces of the flowers!

With monstrous feuds and brawls.
Half-god he deems himself, and lo!
Though blasphemous his dream.

It hungers for the day
When it shall meet some angry star,

VERY NEAR THE VERGE.
“The inherent prosperity of the State is reflected in
the large income of the Treasury collected in a, year
of unfavorable conditions to various interests.”
—Report of N. S. Wales Auditor-General.
The Australian is a difficult person to
move unless he is being urged to get to the
course in time for the first race. This is
chiefly because he is so drugged with loans
that he lives in a dream world where every-
thing comes fairly right, in the long run so
far as material comfort of a sort is con-
cerned. Anybody who has tried to explain
to a group of fat men, all -with the opium
habit, that the house is on fire and that a
move is advisable, will have noticed the
same sort of difficulty, especially if the house
has never been on fire before. And to rouse
even presumably well-informed people to any
genuine concern as to the financial situation
is as difficult as any other awakening pro-
cess. The “inherent prosperity” of any and
every State is held to be sufficiently demon-
strated if the revenue is bigger than ever.
Unfortunately it is quite common for the
borrowings also to be bigger than ever.
When the State Governments put £48,000,000
of new loan money into circulation in a
year, and all these paper funds (gold is very
rare) are wandering into the Treasury as
revenue to-day and wandering out as expen-
diture to-morrow, the turnover is necessarily
larger than in the years between 1901 and
1910, when the average annual borrowings
of the six States averaged a trifle over
£5,000,000. An immensely greater increase
has been noticed in Germany, where a day’s
paper revenue is now as large as a year’s
used to be. This isn’t so much “inherent
prosperity” as inherent and adhesive lia-
bility. The same evidence —record revenues
and all the other garish signs—was visible
in the early nineties of last century in Aus-
tralia. But subsequent events suggested
that there wasn’t any “inherent prosperity”
about it.
•:> •# *
In those days it was the banks that went
in for introducing borrowed capital bo “de-
velop the great natural resources of the
country,” and supply money for “permanent
and reproductive works.” Scotland was in
particular a hunting-ground. To the casual
observer it seemed that every solicitor of
any standing in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee
and Aberdeen announced himself as autho-
rised to receive fixed deposits for the Anglo-
Inflated Bank of Australia, or some similar
institution. The rates, even for short-dated
deposits, were high, just as the rates for
Government loans are now. Competition
was keen—so much so that one manager went
to England in person to dig up more agents,
and declared that he would borrow enough
to make his the greatest bank in Australasia.
The disaster which followed didn’t arise out
of any very grave suspicion as to the sound-
ness of the Anglo-Inflated Bank itself,
though there were shoddy land banks in
plenty. The old land-dealing bubble looked
no more bubbly than its modern successor.
Gold-mining was a far better proposition
than it is in these days; also, there was a
much smaller proportion of the population
in the capital cities and a much larger one
“on the land.” Debt of all sorts per head
was a fraction of the present-day figure, and
the country wasn’t plastered a foot thick
with Government paper for which gold was
unprocurable. Yet with all these advantages
there was a burst. One visible cause was
that the person in England was having a
bad time himself, and didn’t renew the loan.
That sort of disaster can hardly strike the
banks again, for they learned a lesson, and
ceased to hire limbs of the British law to
cadge wholesale for deposits. But it is in-
creasingly liable to strike the Governments,
who find the financial ship not nearly so
buoyant as it was, either on new-loan day
or on renewal-day.
*****
At the last general election Labor, a little
while previously of no importance, suddenly
became the second most important party in
the British Parliament, the legitimate Oppo-
sition, and the Government’s heir, bar acci-
dents. Some level-headed members allege
that they see office in view four years hence.
The central idea of the new men will be less
work and more pay, and considering the pre-
sent British pay in many cases, and the
present hours in some cases, the idea looks
not unreasonable. One’ person who seems
bound to be badly squeezed in the process is
the great and sometimes enormously wealthy
ground landlord, a superfluous middle-man
who roosts expensively on almost every inch
of Britain. What will happen to other
millionaires is hard to say, but it
is well enough known that the party’s
general aim is to make Great Britain
a land of small proprietors and small capi-
talists. Now, money-lending on the scale
that Australia craves for is a big capitalists’
game. Not only might reformed England
drift out of the money-lending game through
the decay of the money-lending class. It
might also have less to lend, the community
deciding to take life more easily and pro-
duce less, which it could probably afford to
do if some of the old institutions were
scrapped. Certainly if it were guided by
sane financiers Australia would provide for
such a contingency. It would recognise that
the indications are that, not only will it be
unable to raise new loans as it has done
hitherto, but the renewal of loans is doubt-
ful. To meet the situation there ought to
be a substantial sinking fund, out of which
any loan falling due might be paid. Without
such a fund we shall be at the mercy of what
moneylenders there are. But sinking funds
cannot be created by waving a stick. They
mean money—hard money. And that money
can only be raised by extra taxation or by
hard economy. In certain directions we have
carried taxation as far as our present indus-
tries can stand it. But our industries could
stand more if they were more profitable; and
our present big job is to make them more
profitable—more profitable and more numer-
ous. And we shall find great difficulty in
doing that until we get down to solid earth,
recognise the size of the problem ahead of
us, blow the froth off both our cost of living
and our wage-payments, cut out all go-slow
methods, and put more real effort into the
organisation of our industries —for, unfor-
tunately, casual habits afflict employers as
well as workmen. At present we are living
in a fool’s paradise: our wild borrowing
policy masks the truth, so that even Auditors-
General talk about large Treasury revenue
being an indication of “inherent prosperity.”
WHAT’S WRONG WITH
NATIONALISM?
A Sydney daily newspaper asked last week
what was wrong with Nationalism, and then
provided an answer :
Parliaments are no longer elected by the free
suffrages of the people, but under a system of hole-
and-corner nomination obtained by influences rang-
ing from party donations to sliding-panel ballot-
boxes. The people are waking up to their position
under this new development of Parliamentary gov-
ernment.
If this were Nationalism’s only trouble there
would be small cause for worry. Actually
the disreputable proceedings which have be-
come a matter of course at nearly every
election, Federal and State, are merely the
symptoms of a much bigger and more sinister
malady than is represented by, say, the pur-
chase of the nomination to a safe National-
ist seat. The disease from which National-
ism is suffering is a legacy of the war, and
it menaces the nation as well as the party.
A British military convention which saw
the war out was that those in high places
can do no wrong. The establishment in a
public way of the incompetence of a general
or even of a socially or politically promi-
nent colonel was supposed to be “bad for
discipline.” In consequence, when officers of
high rank were guilty of errors amounting
to crimes they were never adequately pun-
ished, and usually they were not punished
at all. lan Hamilton, who was first ruined
and then saved by this doctrine, had a lot
to say about it later. The type of senior
officer whose chief recommendation consisted
in being widely known in the Guards Club
as “dear old So-and-So” was given freely
to Hamilton, and when the inevit-
able disaster occurred was shifted back to
a job in England with warm words of sym-
pathy and encouragement from his influen-
tial friends. Hence Suvla Bay, and hence,
eventually, the discrediting of Hamilton,
who when his time came was disciplined as
mildly as those who had damaged his repu-
tation. A corporal who by carelessness let
a prisoner escape, a driver who by careless-
ness lost his horse, could rely on being court-
martialled: a general of division who by
carelessness caused the loss of a great battle
and the death of hundreds was unlucky or
maladroit if he scored less than a K.B.E.
and a, home command. A mistake the mili-
tary authorities made was in imagining that
the rank and file were blind to these dis-
criminations, which prevailed more or less
in all the armies. The arrangement was
good enough for the Dark Ages of Europe,
to which it owed its origin: it could even
be maintained, without much hostile com-
ment, in Britain’s little pre-war army, which
was stronger on the spirit of obedience than
it was on the rights of man. But by the
end of the World War, when armies were
virtually nations, the rotten old dogma was
getting increasingly blown upon, and its life
was only saved, so far as can be judged, by
the sudden ending of the fighting. As things
were shaping on the fronts, had the carnage
lasted another year the British War Office
would have had to choose between more
democratic methods of punishments and re-
wards on the one side and a mutiny on the
other.
In that sense it is to be regretted the war
ended when it did. The high-handed prac-
tices of the military chiefs, which had been
imitated by most of the political depart-
ments at home, became features of every
civilian administration when the peace
arrived. They were adopted by many of the
party bosses, and by any adventurer who
believed he could do good for himself and
his friends by assuming the rble of dictator.
W. M. Hughes was an early convert, in the
natural order of events; and though the
master hand has vanished from the National-
ist helm, the spirit of the old skipper still
dominates the ship. In the army it had
been “bad for discipline” to expose a gen-
eral : in civilian life it is held to be “danger-
ous to law and order” to expose a profiteer
in a really big way. In the army the fate
of an erring general was decided informally
by a handful of his friends: here the fate
of many an erring politician or official of
high rank is similarly decided by other poli-
ticians or officials, who are, or were, the
erring one’s friends or colleagues. It is not
going a yard too far to say that a man who
belongs to the right clubs or moves in the
right political circles in Australia to-day
has not much more to fear from his misdeeds
than a general had during the war. A doctor
may breach almost every law of medical
ethics, and the B.M.A. will not move —always
provided the offender is not an obscure subur-
ban or country practitioner, but a specialist
in a big way. A solicitor with an extensive
family practice may do things with impunity
which would bring a police-court attorney
beneath the notice of the Law Institute and
subsequently draw on him the thunders of
an outraged Court. K.C.’s may conduct
their cases on blackguardly lines, but juniors
are required to preserve the decencies. When
a Sydney attorney altered a date on a docu-
ment some years back, Chief Justice Cullen,
in suspending the offender from practice for
six months, was edifyingly severe on the
enormity of “deceiving the Court.” A couple
of weeks ago the same Chief Justice was
faced with a verdict which imputed to an
ex-Prime Minister, an M.L.A. and an Admiral
(all of the Nationalist persuasion) careless-
ness or worse that threatened the Empire
with ruin when its need was sorest. He had
not one word of disapprobation for these
personages. Neither Ministers nor the Courts
have taken action in respect of them, and
not a single true-blue Nationalist newspaper
has suggested that their conduct, as disclosed
by the evidence, was so much as irregular.
* * * *
The Labor party has its faults—plenty of
them. But even its enemies must admit that
it makes frequent, and often heroic, efforts
at internal reform. The expulsions which
have been chronic with Labor since its for-
mation as a political party 30 years ago
have by no means all been inspired by un-
worthy motives. Nationalism’s control over
its followers is at least as effective as that
of Labor, and there is no reason to imagine
that its morals are better. Yet Nationalism
never expels, never even rebukes outside the
privacy of a club smoking-room. The elec-
tioneering ballot-box with the sliding panel
was an abomination, no doubt, but so was
the buying off of opposition from the last
North Sydney contest in the interests of
W. M. Hughes. Labor at least made a
public effort to deodorise its ballot-box:
Nationalism is still living complacently with
the North Sydney effluvia polluting the pre-
mises. And not only the North Sydney one,
but scores of others. As in the case of the
departmental mandarins of the war years,
the influential Conservatives of Australia
appear to imagine that the rank and file are
not watching and commenting on their acti-
vities. Nothing could be further from the
truth. A civilian population is much more
alive to its wrongs than is the personnel of
an army, and a good deal more resentful of
them ; though in the last resort the soldier’s
organisation gives him a vehicle for express-
ing collective exasperation which the indivi-
dualised man of peace is without. The reason
why Nationalism is a growing danger to the
State, as well as to itself, is that it repre-
sents, as a party and through some of its
prominent adherents, the most dangerous of
all the gospels of unfreedom —that the highly-
placed have a license to behave in a manner
which would not be tolerated in the case of
poor persons. Every revolution of modern
times has been due, more or less directly, to an
insistence on that principle by those who hap-
pened bo be wielding the money or economic
power ; and if the plutocracy of Australia
go far enough on such a fatal track there is
no reason to think that this country will fare
less disastrously than others have done.
CREDITS IN LONDON.
Tile financial year in Australia opens on
July 1, and shortly after that date figures
begin to hint at what the new year will be
like. Trade returns, which are large and
sluggish things, lately became available for
July and August so far as concerned N. S.
Wales and Victoria, and these States stand
for most of the trade. The figures were as
follows:
Two months’ imports .. ..£18,282,263
Two months’ exports .. . . 5,747,311
Excess of imports . . . . £12,534,952
A foreign-trade paper which specialises in
commerce considers that “it remains to be
seen” whether this condition of things will
change much at an early date!
* * * *
Australia is, in a general way, better fitted
for manufacture than for agriculture; that
is to say, its supplies of coal and iron in
particular are better than its supplies of
fruitful land and dependable rainfall. But
its tariff is notoriously insufficient, though
even a good tariff may yield poor results
under some conditions, for instance; —
If union-political bosses teach that extra-short
hours, extra-high wages, go-slow and frequent strikes
are the only genuine proofs that men enjoy the
blessings of freedom, and especially if some of them
teach that work is merely a preparation for “the
revolution.”
If there is a chronic scarcity of skilled labor.
If employers are casual and unambitious.
If six, or even seven, borrowing and land-jobbing
Governments urge people, in and out of season, to
“go on the land,” as the aborigines did, even if all
kinds of land industry, barring the wool business,
are periodically reduced to begging for State assist-
ance.
If the principal State Governments discourage and
destroy small manufacturing towns by the lay-out
of new railways and the faking of railway charges,
and by keeping most of the ports closed.
These and other handicaps can nullify a
better tariff than Australia possesses. So
when there are big credits in London on
Australian account, even if they consist of
money raised by expensive loan for land
settlement and immigration and “permanent
and reproductive works,” imported fluff and
other goods pour in wholesale to the detri-
ment of Australian industry, which sinks into
a bad way. This being a time of big loans
and big imports, industry is naturally not in
a very good way now.
Australia borrows real money (not paper,
which is valueless outside its own country)
in London. None of it comes here except in
the shape of goods, for this country doesn’t
import coin barring small accidental lots.
The position of a country which has such a
tremendous foreign interest bill payable
annually in gold or in -surplus exports which
will sell for gold at the other end, is peculiar,
especially as there are often no surplus ex-
ports. It is distinctly peculiar if the coun-
try’s currency is irredeemable paper (at
least, redemption is suspended till further
notice), and of no value for the payment of
the growing extraneous interest bill, or for
any other outside purpose. A few countries,
such as Brazil and Chile, publish a double-
barrelled budget showing so much revenue
collected in paper, and good for meeting local
liabilities only, and so much in gold, and good
for all purposes. The expenditure is simi-
larly divided, and if the gold revenue is ahead
ot the gold liabilities the position is con-
sidered fairly satisfactory. In Australia it
isn t known how much real money the Trea-
sury gets and the situation is wholly doubt-
ful. The outstanding feature, however, is
that when there are “substantial aggregate
credits” of real money at Australia’s disposal
m London, imports tend to pour in gaily.
That is to say, the Australian merchant with
the necessary quantity of irredeemable (for
the time being) paper can buy a gold-order
to pay for goods in London, provided the
bank has the thrice blessed commodity there.
This process goes on indefinitely unless the
institution acquires cold feet at the depletion
ot its reserves at the other end, possibly be-
cause insufficient new loans have been floated,
and takes strong measures to check the sale
of gold in return for paper. When the goods
arrive the duty on them is paid in paper,
whereas, in some lands of mixed currency,
the tariff money, or some of it, has to be
produced in real coin, one result being that
the importing business doesn’t flourish there
so abnormally as it might. So much are coin
and paper and loans and imports mixed up
that in a recent strenuous time it was gravely
suggested that the Commonwealth should
ship to England the reserve of sovereigns
which it holds against the note-issue, so that
the drafts of merchants here who had bought
too much fluff and things, to the detriment
of local industry, might be honored.
The situation isn’t improved by the fact
that Freetrade Britain is being flooded with
foreign goods, and if the foreign sellers put
the finishing touches to these goods in their
own British factories (it is sufficient to do
25 per cent, of the work there), the articles
can oome in here as British, and enjoy the
advantages of the preferential tariff, though
even the ordinary tariff is too low for the
emergency. Still, the influx of foreign stuffs
would have a limit if Australia hadn’t such
“substantial aggregate credits in London.”
And as all the Premiers and Prime Ministers
and some other Ministers go to London so
regularly, all on much the same errand, it
is to be feared that these credits may endure
for a long while, with much the same results
as at present. For such are the intricacies
of finance and the subtle complications of
commerce, that even an immigration- and
land-settlement loan floated in London is
liable to arrive here (so much of it as does
arrive) in the shape of corsets and mouse-
traps or picture-hats and gimlets.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Old Man Talks Preference.
The Freetrade superstition is still so power-
ful in Britain that no Government can tax
foodstuffs, even in the interests of trade
within the Empire, without imperilling its
own existence. In committing itself to a
new scheme of preferential duties on dried
and preserved fruits the Baldwin Govern-
ment, which has Conservative Freetraders


to reckon with as well as the Cobdenite Lib-
eral and Labor parties (Henderson, one of
the Labor leaders, describes Imperial prefer-
ence as “fantastic folly”), has consciously
taken the risk. Its courage may be ungrudg-
ingly conceded; the only question at this
end'is whether its proposals go far enough.
Currants, of which the U.K. imported
1.190,1100 cwt. in the latest year for which
figures are available, are now taxed 2s. a
ewt. if foreign, and Is. Sd. if grown within
the Empire. The Government offers to admit
Imperial currants (they are Australian for
the most part) free, and “to consider what
increase of duty on foreign consignments is
necessary in order to make preference effec-
tive.” it was pointed out at the Imperial
Conference that Britain has a trade agree-
ment with Greece, from which country it
gets most of its currants, but an unofficial
account has it that this agreement has been
denounced and is being carried on merely
from month to month. The implied promise
of “effective” preference is encouraging, but
the Australian grower—lie produced 180,000
ewt. last year, and could increase the output
many times—will be uneasy until lie knows
what it amounts to ; it wili have to be a lot
more than 2s. a ewt. to do any good. On
raisins, a more considerable item, the British
offer is definite and substantial. There is
still to be a duty of 10s. Od. a ewt. on the
foreign (mainly Californian) article, but
the produce of the Empire, now taxed at Bs.
9d. a ewt., will be admitted free. If the con-
cession is not neutralised by increased
freights, taxes and wages, it should enable
the Australian raisin-man t > hold his own
with the Californians, who arc fond of pro-
claiming that Britain is their best foreign
market, and allay the fears of over-produc-
tion which haunt him day and night. An-
other important proposal relates to dried
apples, pears, peaches and apricots, hitherto
on the free list. On the produce of foreign
orchards there will bo a duty of 10s. 6d. a
ewt., the same as on raisins ; only Empire-
grown fruit will be duty-free. This again
is a case where the preference looks suffi-
cient, provided Arbitration Courts, shipping
companies and tax-levying politicians don’t
go mad. But the outlook for the growers of
soft canning varieties is not so bright. In
the distressful condition of their branch of
the industry a duty of ss. a ewt. against the
foreigner, which is all that is proposed at
present, is not nearly enough. Considering that
the Commonwealth Government has dropped
half a million on the canned-fruit pools, and
has. been invited to lose another £200,000 in
buying up the soft-fruit crop, and letting the
canriers have it for nothing, a proposition
which it has declined, the good likely to
result from a ss. duty is hardly worth taking
into account. All the same, a great advance
has been made by getting a British Govern-
ment to agree that Australia, which has
discriminated in favor of British trade for
many years, is entitled to “effective prefer-
ence” as a member of the family. Once the
principle is firmly established details may
be argued, out and extensions applied for. If
the principle doesn’t fall, and the Govern-
ment along with it, the securing of exten-
sions will be comparatively easy. In the
meantime, of course, Australia will have to
see that there is nothing wrong with the
quality or get-up of the fruit it sends abroad
—no more complaints about grading or
packing.
•
A Rhineland Republic.
The project of a Rhineland Republic has been
brought nearer realisation by Poincare’s
triumph in the Ruhr. It is a French pro-
posal, of course, and is, therefore, violently
opposed by the flock of Freetrade journalists
whose prejudices color the Australian cables,
and who boisterously predicted the failure
of the occupation, but even Germans are see-
ing merit in it. There is a Rhineland Re-
public party, and it looks like growing.
France’s foreign policy, grossly misrepre-
sented by the Freetrade writers aforesaid,
has one object and one alone —security.
Apart from material damage, the last
German invasion—there have been five in 121
years—cost France 1,400,000 young men, the
very flower of the nation; another on the
same scale within the next 20 or 30 years
would destroy her. And what guarantee is
there that it won’t happen? America ex-
plicitly refused to give one. Britain threat-
ens to be governed by a pacifist Labor party
allied, perhaps, with Liberals who are furi-
ously anti-French. The Polish and Czecho-
slovakian Republics are friendly, but of
doubtful stability ; in any case their military
value is small compared with that of Russia,
now allied with Germany. As regards that
Power, France stands in the same strategic
position as in the time of the Third
N.apoleon, when she was overwhelmed in
a few weeks. On the Alsatian side she can
look after herself, but her Lorraine and Bel-
gian frontiers are no safer to-day than in
1914. 1870, 1815. 1814 or 1793. Certainly
Belgium is a firm friend, but there are only
7,500,000 Belgians and 39,000,000 French,
whereas there are 60,000,000 Germans in
Ebert’s Republic alone. Hence the desire of
France and Belgium to interpose a neutral
Republic between them and the Rhine. In
a favorable environment the non-Prussian
German is a peaceful and industrious citi-
zen, as Australia knows. In Switzerland
he has lived for centuries in friendship with
French and Italian minorities. A Rhine-
land Republic, with peace as its lie-all and
end-all. might be as great a blessing to
Europe as Switzerland has been. Some, at
least, of the Rhineland Germans say they
would prefer it to the prospect of being
slaughtered in Prussia’s wars. Prussia, it
should be remembered, is a comparatively
recent interloper on the Rhine.
Divorce by Agreement.
The N. S. Wales Parliament will be asked
shortly to accept a Marriage Act amendment
designed “to make divorce more difficult in
restitution suits.” Members should study
the proposal with care. For generations two
schools of thought have been in conflict on
this issue. Clericalism (represented here
by the Anglican and li.O. churches) claims
that divorce amounts in every case to a defi-
ance of God’s law. Failing any prospect of
abolishing this defiance, they aim sit minimis-
ing it. The opposition school denies that the
Creator intended the contractors of a mis-
taken marriage to live together in perma-
nent misery, and asserts that it is desirable
not only for the happiness of the parties
concerned, but on the score of public morality
and the welfare of the nation, that they
should be encouraged to mate again. Not
mate irregularly and produce children sub-
ject to the disabilities of illegitimacy, but in
a manner as legal and reputable as though
they had not previously been married. It
is here that clericalism steps in with an
argument which is both disingenuous and
illogical. “We will grant,” say the churches
concerned, “that divorce l in which we totally
disbelieve) should be allowable where one of
the parties has been guilty of adultery or
cruelty. True, we will not re-marry even
the innocent victim in such a case. Our
adherents in Parliament, however, will not
oppose measures involving the principle that
there should be divorce where one party
wishes for another chance to make a success
of the marriage (a common enough pheno-
menon where adultery has occurred), but
will concentrate on a desperate fight against
the granting of a divorce where both hus-
band and wife have grown to detest each
other, and, perhaps, have met those who
offer them an expectation of happiness.”
Collusion, which the Law deprecates, was
probably as common under the system which
clericalism condones as it is under the
arrangement which the N. S. Wales Gov-
ernment threatens to alter. Where adultery
or cruelty plus desertion was required, the
husband met the situation by supplying evi-
dence of having been in the company of a
woman at a hotel or elsewhere. Any attempt
to tighten up the procedure iu restitution
matters will be countered in like manner
now. Instead of waging a futile struggle
against collusion, which, after ail, simply
means agreement, and which the public con-
science obstinately refuses to accept as
blameworthy—provided always that the in-
terests of the important third party, the
children, are not sacrificed —the Law should
begin to accept it for what it is—a plan for
enabling citizens to sever impossible con-
tracts cheaply, expeditiously and without
detriment to themselves or their families. It
is absurd to oppose what is miscalled “easy
divorce” (meaning divorce which is within
the reach of the poor as well as the rich)
without condemning every form of divorce as
the authoritarian churches do.
In the Name of Empire.
It has often been remarked that perfectly
respectable words become terms of oppro-
brium through being collared for advertising
purposes by undesirables. “Liberalism” was
a good word till corkscrew politicians appro-
priated it. So was “Nationalism.” So was
“Labor.” The latest to be menaced is "Em-
pire.” One of the most uproarious Empire
men. in Australia is W. Scott Fell, M.L.A.,
of Sydney. He proclaims his Empire loyalty
in and out of the Assembly, and is ever ready
to iihpute "disloyalty to the Flag” to others.
Now a jury has found that at a time when
the Empire was threatened with ruin owing
to the British food-shortage; at a time when
the British Government was considering the
destruction of every cereal-consuming animal
in the U.K. because of the difficulty of im-
porting enough wheat for the people’s needs;
at a time when the control of one ship, more
or less, might have meant the difference be-
tween victory and rout on the home front —
at this crucial stage of the Empire’s history
Mr. Scott Fell was using his influence with
other vehement Empire men to keep British
ships in Australian waters and press them
into his own money-making service. When
the war ended every second A.W.L. specialist
in the A.I.F. be'gan advertising his past
connection with the army as a means of lur-
ing the public into his often nefarious finan-
cial schemes. The executive stopped the
practice, and thereby did something to save
the honor of the Diggers as a body from
defilement and the term “A.1.F.” from ruin.
Similar action may have to be taken in the
interests of the word “Empire” and its deri-
vatives. It is often observed that Austra-
lians are more Imperialistic than the Brit-
ish. We have a right to be. If the Empire
were dismembered to-morrow the British
would remain white and free; this country
would probably be assimilated by an Asiatic
Power. We have more than a community
of interest in the Empire: it is our common
insurance policy, the institution on which
all, rich and poor, Labor and anti-Labor,
depend for their national life. In the cir-
cumstances it is outrageous that any poli-
tician who possesses the requisite effrontery
should be allowed to identify the Empire with
his particular party dogma, and make a class
issue of it. It would be bad enough if all
our professional “Empire” and “King’s men”
could be trusted to live reasonably creditable
political lives. In the natural order of events,*
however, as in the case of the ex-A.I.F. mem-
bers, they are very liable to be the worst
characters who make the loudest protesta-
tions. And every time one of them is ex-
posed, a slur is cast on the institution which
he has managed to identify with himself.
It may be illogical, but human nature is like
that, and it is the business of a practical
people to face facts. If the proposition is
accepted that Australia cannot afford to see
the idea of Empire derided, then it fol-
lows that politicians must be prevented from
exploiting the thing for the purposes of party
and personal propaganda.

Mental Defectives and the Law.
All over Australasia Judges are being con-
fronted with appalling problems, due to the
mediaeval attitude of our laws towards men-
tal defectives. In N. S. Wales Pudlifoot, a
degenerate if ever there was one, will soon
he at large again. In Wellington fM.L.) a
man named Hector Froggatt wa, convicted
last week on four separate charges jf assaults
on small boys. The Judge did his best for
the public by making this horror’s four sen-
tences of two years apiece cumulaG-e —as a
result of which the children of Wellington
will be safe so far as Froggatt is concerned
for nearly eight years. At about the same
time Judge Boole, of South Australia, was
facing another aspect of the same trouble.
The offender, like Froggatt, had been con-
victed of repeated assaults on children, and
though medical specialists had declared him
“incapable of controlling his instincts,” the
Judge discovered that lie was obliged to pre-
scribe the lash, in addition to a brief term
of imprisonment. The idea of punishing
these unfortunates dates, of course, from the
period when the Law attempted to flog and
otherwise torture the Devil out of lunatics.
Modern science knows better, but modern
law still proceeds on the assumption that the
right treatment for a sexual maniac is to
give him a dozen lashes and a year or so in
gaol, and then turn him loose to earn more
lashes and more gaol at the cost, possibly,
of the life of some unprotected infant. It is
High time for a number of our laws to be
amended with an eye to the knowledge that
has accrued iu the last half-century from
medical research; and it is time, too, that in
every case where a moron is brought before
a Court a doctor of standing should be
appointed to assist the Judge.

Immigrants in Victoria.
The Lawson Government proposes to send
an officer to London at an early date to select
immigrants of a type suitable for settling
on the land. and. should all go well in the
meantime, Victoria will be receiving, in the
course of a few months, families of intending
settlers who should be assets to the country,
but who, if the present state of departmental
unpreparedness continues for long, will in-
evitably be lured by high wages to join the
army of town-dwellers. Arrangements for
the reception and speedy settlement of immi-
grants have been practically in a state of
stagnation for the past six months, and there
can be no doubt that, if action is not quickly
taken, the lot of the "selected” land-settler
will be little better than that of his fellow
who has migrated on the offchance of secur-
ing land. At present an immigrant who de-
sires to settle disembarks from the boat and
'seeks out a boarding-house, from which he
daily sallies forth to haunt the Lands De-
partment. He inquires if any blocks are
available, and is shown a list, from which
he makes a provisional selection, and obtains
a free railway ticket to inspect the block
<»f his choice. The immigrant stands little
if any chance to obtain a block in a new sub-
division where returned soldiers are also
applicants, and so his choice is limited to
blocks abandoned by previous holders. One
inspection of a block usually suffices to ex-
plain why it was abandoned, in most cases
through no fault of the previous holder; and
so the immigrant travels up and down the
country at the country’s expense, diminishing
at the same time his own capital with which
he planned to make a start on the land. Re-
ports of the present state of affairs can
have only one effect in England—that of
reducing the flow of immigrants. The
remedy is community settlement. The Lands
Department has, for example, set aside 100
blocks of approximately 150 acres each in
Murrungowar, Eastern Gippsland, where it
is proposed to establish a community settle-
ment for immigrants—though just what com-
munity settlement means the Department itself
does not know. The climate is suitable for
new arrivals from overseas, and the chocolate
soil, when cleared of the timber now on it, is
amongst the finest in Victoria. A metalled
road provides access to the subdivision, and
so the clearing of the land is the only diffi-
culty. The .Lands Department should at
once start the erection of temporary quarters
for the accommodation of immigrants, and
instead of the settlers being placed on their
blocks straight away their energies should be
concentrated on the task of making the land
hi for cultivation. On this system the land
could be cleared in 12 months; by desultory
individual effort the clearing might take 12
years. A fair wage could be paid to each
man and the cost added to the capital value
of the land, which can easily stand the addi-
tional amount, owing to the low purchase
price originally fixed by the Department,
while the material used in the building of the
temporary quarters could be divided among
the settlers and used in the erection of out-
buildings. The settlers would go into occu-
pation of blocks which would quickly become
productive, and owing to the presence on all
sides of fellow immigrants they would be
freed from the narrow-minded antipathy
which unfortunately is shown by some Vic-
torian farmers towards arrivals from other
districts, let alone towards settlers from over-
seas.

Is Our Education Policy a Success?
The conclusions of a headmaster:—
Nobody can say definitely, as the answer depends
on what the policy sets out to accomplish. To the
educational brass-hats our system is all that can
be desired. It does not keep any particular objective
in vieiv, and consequently has no difficulty in “getting
there.” From a business man’s point of view, the
product of our schools is nothing to be proud of.
One too frequently finds the stipulation “must be
neat and accurate at figures” in the advertisements
of prospective employers. , Recently I heatrd a
master printer bemoaning his inability to get “edu-
cated” boys capable of writing three sentences gram-
matically. These people have found two of the
great weaknesses in the school syllabus. The teach-
ing of mathematical subjects has been modified to
such an extent that pupils get to understand the
operations involved, but do not get sufficient drill
work to perform them automatically. Speed and
accuracy have been sacrificed to prevent the sub-
ject becoming uninteresting. Similar modifications
affect the teaching of English, the king-pin subject
in our Educational fabric. Formal grammar is now
practically abolished, it was ruled out for no valid
reason other than that pupils found it dull. When
youngsters use incorrect expressions they are told
the correct form without having any reason assigned
for its use. It is confidently hoped that, in the
few hours of the school day, habits of correct speech
will be formed having sufficient strength to crowd
out the habits of incorrect speech formed during
several hours of contact with undesirable associa-
tions in the street. The idea is a fallacy. It gener-
ally results in pupils speaking fairly correctly under
the sobering influence of the classroom and incor-
rectly when out of it. Environment, rather than
knowledge, is regarded as the basis of the child's
education, and when 1*? exists, from the point of view
of language, in two divergent environments —the
school and the street —he most certainly will develop
a formal speech for school and a provincial one for
general use. The fundamental rules of grammar in
so far as they elucidate the difficulties of everyday
speech are a necessity. Better exponents of the
art of self-expression were produced by the old
“rule-of-thumb” methods of teaching English than
by the new “rule-of-ear” system.
1 have the fortune —or misfortune—to deal with a
number of youngsters who have passed through a
course of primary instruction. They have plenty
of. vague general ideas, but know nothing thoroughly.
A wide range of subject matter has been presented
to them in the most interesting manner possible.
They followed it in a general sort of way, hut their
ideas are neither clear cut nor definite. The term
“Jack of all trades” describes the primary school-
boy. Ho leaves school fitted for nothing in par-
ticular, obtains employment in some dead-end occu-
pation of the shop-assistant or messenger type till
he is old enough to receive the basic wage, and is
then pushed into the ranks of the casual worker,
to make way for a younger and cheaper youth.
Skilled workers are dwindling in numbers annually,
while a corresponding increase in unskilled laborers
is following as a matter of course. The N.S.W.
Superintendent of Technical Education recently de-
clared that in another decade Australia would have
to import skilled artisans. It should be the duty
of our schools to combat this unfortunate trend.
At present they only accentuate it.
Much of the educational clap-trap one hears is
based on experiments carried out in Europe and
America, where the conditions of life and require-
ments of the country differ considerably from our
own. Australia is a young nation whose prosperity
and safety depend on self-development. Men with
specialised knowledge are required for the work,
but little is being done to provide them. Our
schools should train boys to provide for themselves,
and in doing so they will provide for the country.
Secondary schools should lead on to universities simi-
lar to those of Manchester and Leeds, where students
concentrate on technical courses of study. To many
people such an idea is repulsive on account of its
utilitarianism; nevertheless, thinking people must
admit that the study of engineering, for example, is
of as much value from the educational- point of
view as the classics, and infinitely more useful in
an undeveloped country. We do not know the
opinion of the general public regarding these matters,
because no one ever took the trouble to find out.
We obtained and abided by public opinion on the
national question of conscription, but the equally
important question of changes in educational policy
has been left in the hands of a select few who know
little of, and care less for, the wishes of the people
concerned.
A Bill for Whitewash.
The report of E. F. Mitchell, K.G., who
inquired as a Royal Commissioner into the
1920 sugar transactions of W. E. Davies,
was made available to the press last Thurs-
day. It is a credit in every way to the emi-
nent barrister’s trust in human nature. He
certainly makes one or two remarks which
slightly mar the benign atmosphere sur-
rounding an effort which is not so much a
report as a public tribute: —
He thought that efforts were clearly made by Mr.
Davies after his return from Java to conceal from
some one or more persons the real profits that he
had received from his associate, Mr. Nash.
Also: —
If Mr. Davies had not been an old friend of Mr.
Deane's he would never have succeeded in his
attempt to sell sugar to the Commonwealth.
And finally
There is little evidence as to the exact part played
by Mr. Deane in enabling Mr. Davies to get his
quotation on behalf of Mr. Nash directly before Mr.
Massy Greene and the Prime Minister, but I do not
think it would be difficult for a clever and experi-
enced private secretary, who had gained the complete
confidence of the Prime Minister, to do so, especially
when Colonel Oldershavv was in Sydney.
Nevertheless he exonerated Mr. Davies and
Mr. Deane of tricky conduct, sharp prac-
tice, or anything of that nature, though he
regarded part of Davies’s story ns “quite
unique,” and though one of his reasons for
believing Deane’s explanation was that this
young man was “too clever to have been so
indiscreet as some of the allegations against
him suggested.” The Commissioner was able
to take the view lie did —a view so creditable
to his own heart, and so cheering, it is to
be hoped, to the public—notwithstanding
some truly formidable facts. In three deals
Davies —who possessed no knowledge of
the sugar business—was able to make
£30,000. He was in Java when his ship
came well and truly home, and one of his
lirst actions was to cable £lOOO to Deane
“to invest in a Siamese tin-mine.” Deane
did not invest, but handed back the money
to Davies on the latter’s return. At the
same time Davies drew £4OOO in cash out of
his bank, put it in an envelope and "left it with
his solicitor.” He did not tell his solicitor or
anybody else that there was £4OOO or any
other suni in the envelope, and he let the
cash lie there for the best part of two years.
This was the transaction which Mitchell,
K.C., described as “quite unique.” In point
of fact, as any Crown Prosecutor could have
told him, analogous happenings are occur-
ring every day. Persons who have been so
unfortunate as t.. be charged with receiving-
stolen property constantly explain that the
goods were handed to them by strange men
who immediately dashed away and were
never seen again; others on being asked to
explain the ownership of large sums of money
mention that they won the cash at the races
from bookmakers whose names they could
not remember and over horses and races they
had forgotten. Juries often accept these odd
tales as true: Judges not so often. The
Bulletin does not for a moment suggest
that the Commissioner should have found
against Mr. Davies on the strength of his
remarkable methods of finance. “Where
there is no legal evidence there can be no
legal guilt.” But what it does say is that
this fortunate gentleman’s conduct, and that
of some of his friends, was sufficiently
peculiar, not to say suspicious, to call for
severer strictures than it got. There is a
salutary rule in divorce that, where the con-
duct of a co-re. has been markedly indiscreet,
he shall be liable for certain costs even
where his innocence has been established.
It is a principle that might well be applied
to Royal Commissions. In the case under
discussion nothing has been legally proved
against anyone, and to that extent those
implicated had a cleat' right to a favorable
verdict. But many of their doings were such
as might be expected of guilty parties, and
for these indiscretions they should have been
made to pay. As it is, of course, the tax-
payer will foot the whole of the bill for the
whitewash.
Is the Jury System Played Out?
“J.8.D.” comes to its defence :
“Solomon Malapik>i>’s” hostility (B. 11/10/’23)
to the jury system (“1 am not sure that the system
will ever be all that it is cracked up to he’' ; “a jury
is a fairly good institution except when it is
most wanted,” etc.) naturally suggests the query:
What does he propose as a substitute? Trial by
Judges, apparently. (“Jury-squaring is a recognised
industry,” he says—“ Judge-squaring isn’t.”) But
Judge-squaring was a recognised industry for cen-
turies —some of the most corrupt of England’s
Judges were Lords Chief Justices—and there is no
reason to doubt that, given the unlimited powers
Judges once wielded, some would become corrupt
again. Those were the days when, in “Solomon
Malai’liop's” phrase, “great achievements m the way

of getting convictions without evidence or against
evidence were done with juries.” The Old Bailey
trial of Penn and Meade for street-preaching (“a
tumultuous assembly”) provides an explanation.
When the jury found the accused not guilty, the
Recorder expressed his admiration for the Spanish
Inquisition as a method of dealing with malefactors,
and the Lord Mayor said lie “would cut the throat
of the foreman Lone Bush ell] as soon as he could. ’
The Bench then fined the jurors 40 marks apiece
and committed them to gaol till they paid up. Set
against the opinion of “Malaprop” on the principle
which is behind the jury-ay stem in criminal trials
that of a great Judge, Lord Erskine :
The administration of criminal justice in Hie
hands of the people is the basis of all freedom.
While that remains there can be no tyranny, because
the people will not execute tyrannical laws on them-
selves. Whenever it is lost, liberty must fall
along with it, because the sword of justice falls
intoi the hands of men who, however independent, have
no common interest in the mass of the people.
As to the working of the system in civil cases
(“Juries, ' observes “Malaprop,” “begin to be
avoided in civil eases, except by people who want
to dodge justice very badly indeed”), a remaik of
Lord Justice Atkin, in Calcraft v. London General
Omnibus Co., last May, is apposite:—
Trial by jury, except in the very limited classes
of cases assigned to the Chancery Court, is an essen-
tial principle of our law. It has been the bulwark
of liberty, the shield of the poor from the oppression
of the rich and powerful. Anyone who knows the
history of our law knows that many of the liberties
of the subject were originally established and main-
tained by the verdicts cf juries in civil cases.
Instead of seeking to undermine the jury system, by
whittling away its powers, or by substituting trials
by Boards, etc., for trials by jury in criminal
matters, the State should devote itself to trans-
forming juries into the reputable institutions they
once were. In the days when juries were doing
their best work it was an honor to serve on them.
Under our exemption arrangement—and the list is
constantly being extended —to be summoned on a
jury is fast developing into a sort of official pro-
clamation that the good man and true is a moron.
Even when the best minds of the community are
required to serve there will be errors, and even
when the rich are compelled to undertake this duty
there will be talk of corruption. Criticism is several
million times easier than the production of a con-
structive policy calculated to produce a state of
perfection. In the meantime the jury system stands,
and the thinker who can evolve a better all-round
device for ensuring a fair deal between man and
man, in every aspect of the chronic row which is
life, will deserve well of the world.
Labor and the Reds.
Those who see in the doings of the American
Federation of Labor, which threw out the
Reds, a hopeful sign of a spirit which may
lead to a return of Australian Labor to
sanity are unduly optimistic. The American
organisation excludes many of the elements
which are included in the Australian Labor
organisation; and it carried a motion con-
demning the amalgamation of unions on in-
dustrial rather than craft lines. In spite of
the opposition of craft unionists in Australia,
industrial unionism which is axiomatic in
the I.W.W. faith, has gained most ground
during the last decade and a half in Aus-
tralia, especially in N. S. Wales; and it
has debased the spirit of the old unionism.
That used to represent, not only a deter-
mination to combine for mutual advantage,
but a pride in the craft which prevailed to
such an extent that, some unions maintained
the right to exclude men who were inefficient
workmen. The craft unions used to repre-
sent in Australia an aristocracy of Labor,
as they do in America to-day ; but employers
(especially the big governmental and civic
enterprises) have helped the industrialists
to break down the old foundations of union-
ism, and the old craft or guild spirit has been
swamped by the materialism of the industrial
group, which thinks of nothing but exact-
ing the highest wages and the best conditions
without any regard to an honest return in
work value. In America there are two dis-
tinct divisions of Labor. That which the
Federation of Labor represents is still an
aristocracy, which, by pride in its crafts and
solid organisation, has exacted for a vast
number of its members what are probably
the best wages and conditions in the world
- —including conditions not even thought
about in Australia. For instance, on every
big building job the employer has to erect
dressing-rooms, so that, after their toil, his
bricklayers may have a bath, put on their
travelling clothes and go home as comfort-
ably as the business man leaving his office.
It is this aristocracy which possesses the
motor-cars sometimes mentioned as asso-
ciated with American workmen. The bulk
of its constituents are men of Nordic extrac-
tion. On the other side of the picture are
masses of poorly paid, unskilled workers,
who are ignored by the Federation of Labor,
and likewise ignore or are hostile to it.
They are largely composed of Latins, Slavs
and Magyars ; and the organisations to which
they belong are built upon revolutionary
and I.W.W. principles—or lack of prin-
ciples. In our present circumstances—that
is to say, under conditions of artificial pros-
perity produced by heavy borrowings—there
is small ground for hope that avc shall get
hack to the old craft unionism. But under
more natural and harder conditions it seems
incredible that the really skilled worker will
be content to get no advantage out of his
efficiency.
Hodge and Addlehede.
Strange, cranky ideas are mooted in
England, which wants to preserve the name,
semblance and outer husk of Freetrade, and
yet avoid the ruin which the reality is fast
bringing upon the land. France, Belgium
and Germany now buy wool in the English
market at prices higher than J. Bull can
afford to give, and yet out of this wool they
make cloth which they sell in England at
prices lower than J. Bull can afford to
take. Rather than shut out the foreigners’
cloth with a robust inward duty, it has
been suggested that an export tax should be
put on the wool, so that the foreigner won’t
be able to pay so much for it, and J. Bull
will get it cheaper. Australians and Maori-
lariders own a lot of the wool, and the idea
of cutting down their returns so that the
old Freetrade superstition may “save face”
is calculated to make the father of a row.
Meanwhile the English farmer has started a
row on his own. He says that the barley
crop, by reason of foreign competition, will
fetch £1,300,000 less than the amount it will
cost to produce after paying rates, taxes,
very moderate wages, and Lord Addlehede,
the landlord, a person of problematical use-
fulness. He also sees ahead a price of 40s.

American ears they must make it a condition of sale that the buyer also takes American tyres."

tion, after paying rates, taxes, wages and
Addlehede, will be 60s. If the crop is as
large as last year’s the loss will be
£8,000,000. With manufactures and agri-
culture on the slump together, and a big
foreign creditor to pay, the position looks a
record for badness. It seems to call for the
abolition of Freetrade, or the abolition of the
landlord, or both. If the Irish Free State
makes a success of things, and becomes a
shining example of what a. country may be
when it has got rid of the Cobden blight
and practically got rid of the agricultural
landlord, there may be the beginning of a
revolution in England. It is a weird and
illogical thing that Britain should have
spent a hundred millions or so (which it is
never likely to get back) to free Ireland of
its agricultural landlords, and quite forgotten
to get rid of its own.

Money’s Worth.
It G. N. Cliffwell on the sordid end of an
experiment:—
There is irony attached to the passing from the
Victorian public service of W. T. Conder, ex-Major
A.1.F., Governor of Pentridge Gaol. No recent
Victorian has had more controversy whirl around
him; the precarious Lawson Government has been
shaken more than once on his account; few public
servants have been given greater power, and pro-
bably not one has had a job made for him and kept
warm until he was sufficiently experienced to occupy
it. All of it—its security of tenure, its possibilities,
its present kudos, its past triumphs— Conder, still
s b °y in years and enthusiasm,- lias cheerily aban-
doned in favor of a job connected with moving-
pictures ! And so lightheartedly did he contem-
plate the transition that he allowed the evening press
to know his intentions before tendering his formal
resignation. So closes a very interesting, and in
some ways inspiring, experiment in Victorian social
economics.
Conder enjoyed his job as “broom” in the penal
department and Pentridge Gaol. A student of
penology, he sailed into his by no means easy task
with the same breeziness and vim with which he
tackled that which made his early reputation as an
administrator and a handler of difficult situations
and uneasy men—Langwarrin v. d. camp during the
war. He was harried out of the service, of course—
though, also of course, this will not be admitted.
The penal service is not a model of what a State
organisation should be. Its staff is wretchedly paid,
and, naturally, the service does not attract either an
ambitious or a high type of servant. Being unambi-
tious, members of the service, despite oppressive hours,
depressing environment and miserable pay, cling fast
to their jobs. Thirty years’ service is common. This
makes for red tape, conservatism, detestation of
change. Conder started his reign with change. His
quick, young eye, fresh from the autocracy of a war-
command, noted at once what need there was for
change. He was, therefore, “up against” the dead-
weight of conservatism from the start, meeting a
bloc within the service which, if not actively antago-
nistic to himself and his methods, was critical, sus-
picious and—worst phase of all —ready to talk. At
the time of Conder's appointment to Pentridge the
Srx was threatening its invasion of Melbourne, and
the Herald was waking to a need for vigor to meet
the invasion. There were bright young reporters
abroad, eager to snap up anything the blo\c was pre-
pared to divulge. It was in this way the famous
“crucifixion” speech of Conder, peg upon which to
hang a score of questions in Parliament and of soap-
box protests, was given to the world. And dozens
of other titbits since.
Conder’s gospel of redemption inside the gaol
was Work, plenty of it; Recreation, earned and in
reason ; and Betterment. His aim was to make gaol
in part a place of discipline for wrongs done, but
more a place of retreat from the sordidness of life
which is at the bottom of so much crime and evil-
living ; a nd an opportunity for rehabilitation. Gaol,
with its regularity of life and occupation, irs
abstentions, its freedom from temptations, its decent
relaxations, was to act as a lesson showing how
easy it was to live decently, and what material
and moral' gains were to be acquired thereby. Hence
the gaol band, the fresh paint, the toothbrushes, the
showers, the pictures on cell walls, the entertain-
ments, the better food, which gave Conservatism so
many texts from which to preach sermons against
the new Pentridge.
None is more conservative than the old gaolbird.
He kicked hard and early against the new young
governor’s new young ways. So there were fires,
mutinies, attempts at escape, all given out to the
waiting press almost before they had happened.
Thus the Old Guard of the penal service joined with
the Old Hands of the gaol population to make hard
the reformer’s path.
Perhaps it is human nature to have sympathy with
the gaoled rather than the gaoler. There were
always plenty ready' to seize upon anything untoward
which occurred at Pentridge or under Conder. The
flaws in his system were quickly noted; its good
points were unnoticed save in the formal reports of
a not-brilliant Chief Secretary. And who ever takes
note of the stilted reports of a Chief Secretary when
there is a vivid “story” on the other side to be read
in the evening sheet? Errors, inevitable in a ser-
vice hidebound and discontented, kept cropping up
—escapes from country gaols, discovery of firearms
in Pentridge stores, gaol rows and gaol deaths. All
were blamed upon the New System —and, of course,
Conder. And ever and anon the “crucifixion” speech
would be hauled out and sobbed over by' notoriety-
hunters with tongue in cheek.
Now Conder settles all controversies by' coolly
dropping out, leaving the Government, which never
gave him more than a perfunctory backing, to com-
plete his scarcely-started job. It is a sardonic
finishing-touch. Conder set out to reform the Vic-
torian penal system at £516 a year. The amount
was increased later to the equivalent of some £l4
a week —about the amount the Firm to whom
Conder is transferring would pay a chorus-girl pro-
moted to a singing part. It will probably now slip
thankfully back to the old, placid, dead-end but
undisturbing way. It will pay £516 a year—and
get what the money is worth.

The first purely tropical self-governing white
dominion was added to the British Empire
the other day. Southern Rhodesia is about
half the size of N. S. Wales, and it starts its
independent career with a Cabinet of six
Ministers and a white population of 33,620,
or, rather, that was the number on census
day 2| years ago. There is nothing ridicu-
lous in” this small beginning. Australia used
to do things like that (or the British rulers
used to do them in Australia) before
the Australian became fat and inert
with borrowed money. The father of
Responsible Governments in Australia was
that of William Haines, which took office
in Melbourne on November 28, 1855. Vic-
toria was a giant in the way of population
among the States formed out of the break-up
of the original convict empire, yet it began
complete self-government with a population
of only 347,305, or much fewer than the pro-
posed new State in Northern N. S.
Wales can show. Queensland began respon-
sible government with about 25,000 people,
S.A. with 100,000, Tasmania with 70,000.
Westralia with 48,000. And all of these ex-
cept Queensland had been separate colonies,
with more or less control over their own
affairs for many years previously. Tas-
mania, in particular, had been “on its own”
for 31 years before William Thomas Napier
Champ blossomed forth as the original Pre-
mier. Maoriland may be said to be the
Legislative parent of all Australasia, for
its original Parliament met on May 27.
1854. and when the white population was
counted 4-i years later it amounted to
only 59,413. The colored population was
too cantankerous and too well-armed for
enumeration. So Southern Rhodesia is only
following the good Australasian examples
that used to be but are no longer.

“Clifford SnoOk.” : An Irish-Australian
Association is forming in these parts to pro-
mote good feeling among Irish people here,
the commodity being scarce and in need of
formal promotion. The association is to
be non-sectarian, but the Mannix section of
fierce sectarian battlers are in it. Also, it
is to be non-political, and at the same time
its great object is to help Ireland on the
road to its “national destiny.” Now, Free-
State Ireland is assumed to have two des-
tinies —the majority destiny being to govern
itself inside the Empire as we do, and have
the protection of the Empire’s fleet and army,
while the minority destiny is to get outside
the Empire and protect itself against Mus-
solini or Lenin or Mustapiia Kemal the
best way it can. As the first or peaceful
destiny has been achieved, and as the 1.-A.A.
is no more satisfied than before, it is pre-
sumably a non-political revolutionary body
crammed with non-sectarian archbishops. In
other words, this local row, concerning an
island at the antipodes, and not much bigger
than Tasmania, is to be fought out in our
front garden ail over again, with big feet
stamping on the flowers and big voices scar-
ing the cat into fits. It won’t really help
or hinder proceedings in Ireland, whatever
they may be, if an Irish-Australian Asso-
ciation shouts its war-cry here, and per-
suades some opposition people to bellow' in
reply, and fight the outermost fringe of the
shindy amid our garden produce, any more
than a robust assault by local Greeks upon
local Italians would have hastened the
evacuation of Corfu. But some very doubt-
ful characters make advertisement out of
the irrelevancies. A few of them actually
become Ministers in that way. And that is
the sort of thing Australia should have no
use for.
•
The practice adopted by the police of putting
aliases after an accused person’s name on the
charge-sheet should be abolished. To the
majority of country J’s.P. it conveys that the
prisoner has been in trouble before, and on
this account it is likely to go further than
the evidence in securing a conviction.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There was nothing sensational or spec-
tacular about Vic. Treasurer McPherson’s
sixth Budget. As usual he announced a
surplus—£looo a day for 1922-23 —and for
the current year he expects to collect
£22,247,425, and spend it all except £62,600.
He is using his surplus to pay off a bit of
the years-old revenue deficit of £1,182.000
and to replenish the Railway Development
Fund depleted in recent years. There are
also to be doles for low-paid married civil
servants and pensions for police , (an election
is in sight), and there is to be no new tax-
ation except increased fees on motors, heavy
vehicles in particular. The worst feature of
Victorian finance is the increase in the
funded debt. It now stands at £114,569,000.
or £8,224,000 net more than last year, and
the riot is to go on. There is to be further
borrowing for roads, railways, waterworks
and schools, and no less than £414,000 more
will be required this year for interest. Talk
of a real surplus in such circumstances is of
course nonsense. A Bung who lent a dopey
customer £5O, and then drew an intending
buyer’s attention to the fine revenue he had
during the next few days, might, in fact,
be regarded as a bit of a rogue.
Hague, Treasurer of S. Aus., was safely
delivered of his first Budget in a speech of
one hour. With pride he announced that
although £70,000 had to be spent on unfore-
seen extras, the revenue had kepi a little
ahead and left a £5OOO surplus. The stop-
page of the B. 11. Proprietary Co.’s opera-
tions at Iron Knob was a blow, but the
railway receipts took a jump with better
conditions at the Barrier: they showed a
net profit for the first time since 1914. With
a 13-bushel harvest confidently anticipated,
Hague forecasts another surplus—of the
dubious kind peculiar to Australia —in 1923-
24. Meanwhile, direct taxation is to re-
main on the present scale.
“Sixenate” sees trouble coming :
Feeling that a general election is not far off the
N. S. Wales A.L.P. has started to collect funds, after
discovering a deplorable shortage in its pants pockets.
J. M. Power, M.L.C., has been given the job of
organiser, a nd is now out gathering the shekels —-
such as are gatherable. Another sign of impending
trouble is that politicians are spending week-ends
in prospecting their electorates. And one used part
of a lucky strike at Randwiek to pay a deposit on
election literature to an untrusting printer.
It is taken for granted by Labor politi-
cians, delegates and editors that the Austra-
lian worker is a socialist. They are all con-
vinced that he is bent on “overthrowing the
competitive system,” differing only as to
whether he would prefer to do it by violence
or evolutionary processes. If anything could
rid their minds of this dangerous nonsense
it should be the attitude of "the victim of
capitalistic greed” when asked to vote on a
concrete socialistic issue. State monopoly
of the liquor business would be a large
stride towards socialism ; also, it is the policy
of the Queensland Labor party, which lias
been in power since 1915. Yet at the 1920
prohibition poll only 28,294 primary votes
were cast for it, as against 175,620 for con-
tinuance. At the recent referendum there
were 194,000 for continuance—which stands
for “wage-slavery,” “production for profit”
and all the rest of it—and a mere 14,000 for
Statq management, importation and sale.
Not one Labor electorate polled a majority
for the Labor-socialist policy. Nevertheless,
the Labor politician, delegate and editor will
continue to nourish their fixed idea that Aus-
tralia is craving to be socialised on German
or Russian lines.
The N.S.W. Government’s licensing bill
naturally doesn’t suit either the trade or the
wild water-waggoners; and there would be
something wrong with it if it did. But the
trade always swallows its medicine much
better than its cold-tea friend does. It doesn’t
froth at the mouth because its living is to
go to a referendum : it rather smiles because
the vote is five years in the distance. Mean-
time the Licenses Reduction Board will go
steadily ahead wiping out the most objec-
tionable and least-wanted pubs—and with
that sword hanging over his head lie will
be a very mad Bung who doesn’t try to run
liis business decently. And the other Bungs
will be just as mad if they don’t discipline
their erring or slack brother. The trade, is
really on five years’ probation —assuming
that this bill goes through in its present
form or thereabouts —and what happens to
it then will largely depend on itself.
KINGLY FORETHOUGHT.
“Mr. Bruce has received an audience from the King and has been sworn in as a Privy Councillor.”
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS GEORGE: “A man has to use his head in a job like mine.”
HIS IMMACULATE HIGHNESS STANLEY : “In what way?”
HIS ROYAL FILBERTS GEORGE : “Well, for instance. I might draw mg sword to knight a
young fellow like you, not thinking that in the act of kneeling you would hope-
lessly bag your pants at the knees! Hom'd you like to be a P.C. ?”
Having brought out a lot of immigrants
the Vic. Government talks of acquiring a
model farm and giving them a quick-lfinch
course of agricultural instruction. It is
looking round for a plot of earth in the
Western District, and praying that the cost
of the experiment won’t look too ominous in
the next balance-sheet. Last year Australia
imported £131,808.000 worth of goods,
mostly manufactured, and no doubt Lawson’s
“farmers” helped to make them. But in-
stead of hiring Choom to turn out articles
for which there is a steady demand, and
which job he has learned (being good at all
kinds of factory work), the Australian Gov-
ernments engage to teach him the tedious
and expensive business (not 10 p.c. will ever
master it) of growing vegetables and things
which the Commonwealth doesn’t need and
the world isn’t keen on.
It is the British Minister for Agriculture
who reports that “only in exceptional cir-
cumstances can wheat now be grown at a
profit in England, because the world’s supply
is greater than the effective demand.” And
still the people who talk most about popu-
lating Australia can think of nothing better
than sending men on to the land to grow for
export this very article >of which too much
is already exported—of which “the world’s
supply is greater than the effective demand.”
The Royal Commission on the Navigation
Act has been told by the secretary of a big
Westralian co-operative co. that he could
ship a cargo to Manchester for less than it
would cost to send the same cargo to Sydney.
Also, that the freight on fencing-wire dragged
to Fremantle is 425. 6d. a ton from New-
castle (N.S.W.) and 38s, from London or
New York. Being a Freetrader, the gentle-
man argues that the Navigation Act is op-
pressive, and ought to be repealed. Another
way of looking at it is that foreign goods
are being carried at such low rates that the
tariff is losing its protective incidence, and
ought to be increased.
The Tariff Board, being “anxious to assist
the Australian motion-picture industry,”
lias promised to look into the American mo-
nopoly, but starts off with the chilling an-
nouncement that it doesn’t believe in re-
stricting imports. There is no such squeam-
ishness about the Yanks when they want to
protect their own industries against Austra-
lian competition. Informed that there was
no embargo on fresh grapes from Australia,
some Merbein (Vic.) co-operators sent 500
cases to San Francisco. There they were
passed by the Federal authorities, but the
State Board of Agriculture prohibited their
sale within California on the ground that
they might be suffering from elephantiasis or
red rust. In the end the consignment had
to be railed across the continent to N. York,
where it brought £l2 less than the freight,
The Carl Laemmles and Adolph Zukors have
nothing to fear from a Government which
takes these things lying down.
“Galleryman,” from his loft: —
Having' patched up a temporary peace with his
supporters, Vic. Premier Lawson will now endeavor
to give an imitation of a busy politician striving to
make reparation for several weeks of empty talk.
But recess, which is only a little over two months
away, will probably find him with no great record
of achievement behind him, and certainly with no
striking legislation on the Statute Book. The Re-
distribution of Seats Bill has been carefully side-
tracked for this year; it won't come up until
Parliament meets in June cr July, 1924. Since Law -
son will have to pass this measure to redeem a
rather hoary pledge, and since it is unlikely that
such a contentious piece of legislation can go through
in the time available, there is talk of extending
Parliament for a few months longer than the trien-
nial term. There are Westralian precedents for the
expedient, rare as it is, and members whose seats
will suffer when boundaries are rearranged are not
expected to be violent in their objections to it.
“Gallery”: Of greater political signifi-
cance than the hostility to McPherson, the
Yic. Treasurer (B. 4/10/’23), is the unpopu-
larity of Premier Lawson. Part of it has
been provoked by Lawson’s talent for shed-
ding inconvenient colleagues. There is always
a certain amount of bittern,ess about a
sacked pal, but the mordancy of two ex-
Ministers towards their old chief, coupled
with the coolness of at least one other, is too
significant to be put down to mere dis-
appointment.
It was a sinister coincidence that Theo-
dore’s Dawson Valley irrigation scheme
should have been introduced to the Queens-
land Parliament on the very day that the
Auditor-General tabled his report on the
Inkerman proposition. That comparatively
small project, involving 18,000 acres, was
originally estimated to cost £131,000; on
June 30’last only 2500 acres had been irri-
gated, and the cost was £392,836; it is esti-
mated that approximately £65,000 will be
required to complete the work. And here-
abouts the Auditor was moved to remark
that “unjustifiable and unnecessary expen-
diture, from which any benefit is unlikely,
entails a writing-down of capital expendi-
ture of about £170.000.”
“Fax”: The depressing manoeuvres that
are the rule on these occasions preceded
the selection of William Brunton as Mel-
bourne’s next Gaud Mayor. For three
months his friends had put it around that
he was the chosen candidate, but at the last
moment Brunton was not sure of beating
Charles Atkins. The civic soul of Atkins,
however, revolted from the idea of a neck-
and-neck struggle down the straight. He
retired in the other man’s favor. Brunton
is slightly his senior in Council service, and
Atkins’s contention has always been that
councillors should be gaud-mayored in turn,
according to seniority of service, and for
one year only. Under present conditions a
candidate for the mayoralty is compelled
to canvass for votes, and having canvassed
himself into the job lie is allowed to intrigue
for re-election and re-election, until his
capacity for grinding his little axe has
earned him a knighthood. Then he retires,
as a rule.
In Washington, it is said, there is a dis-
position to meet the British preference to
the Dominions “with the retaliatory
measures provided for in the American tariff
law.” The trouble arises from “the
Dominions’ ” insistence upon separate repre-
sentation at the Peace Conference —and that
was almost wholly Hughes’s performance.
The U.S.A. wouldn’t have a leg to stand on
if the Empire was a unit in foreign rela-
tions : it could no more complain about pre-
ference then than we have a right to com-
plain because the U.S. trade with mid-
Pacific Honolulu is treated as coastal trade.
Honolulu didn’t demand separate representa-
tion at the Peace Conference ; Australia did,
and got it. “Nqw,” says Uncle Sam, “you
can’t have it both ways—you can’t be one
unit when it suits you and several units
when it suits you better.” And one is bound
to admit that Uncle has the thick end of the
argument.
The pernicious habit of issuing loans free
of income-tax has now been adopted by the
Vic. State Savings Bank, which ought to
know better. Its new 54 p.c. loan
(£2,000,000 for 1.0 years) has been offered
free of Commonwealth and State income-
taxes. The bank is certainly guaranteed
by the Victorian. Government, but it has
never been endowed by either the Common-
wealth or the .State Parliament with the
right to say that the interest it pays shall
be tax-free. Presently, unless the decision of
the last Treasurers’ Conference is rigidly
enforced, municipal councils and Water
Boards will be claiming the privilege, and
along with the multitude of wage- and
salary-earners who pay no inoome-tax Aus-
tralia will have a solid body of wealthy
idlers who have put everything thev possess
into tax-free securities. The principle is
monstrously wrong, and the results may be
dangerous.
Booze will help to finance Victoria this
financial year as well as last. The Licens-
ing Fund will be tapped for £150,000, as
against £157,000 in 1922-23. Authority to
draw thus from the stocking was given 11
months ago when the Liquor Bill putting off
local option till 1930 was passed.
UNDER THE INFLUENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The only scene of violence during the all-night
debate on the second reading of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment’s new Liquor Bill was provided by the ejection
of three teetotal zealots from the Speaker’s Gallery
for applauding Dr. Arthur’s philippics too heartily.”
Their boisterous cheers disturbed the Talking Shop,
Creating the impression they were “sprung.”
But deem not it was juice of vine or hep
Or any nosepaint kept in stock by Bung
That earned them the attention of a cop ;
What worked tne mischief was the doctor’s tongue.
No liquid stimulants had stol’n their sense;
’Twas only pure Arthurian eloquence.
The fire with which the orator inveighed
Against the devastating Demon Booze,
The smashing punches that he dealt the Trade,
His blistering scorn for anyone who brews
Or quaffs a headier drink than lemonade —
This was the perilous stuff that made them lose
Their blocks, and misbehave and stamp and shout
Until a John arrived and put them out.
Some men their robe of honor off will fling
When wine or amber whisky holds them thrall;
A draught too deep from any Bacchic spring
May lead you into pranks that will appal
Next morning; even dinner ale's a thing
To deafen persons to decorum’s call.
But nothing that from glass or flask you suck
Secured these three disorderlies the chuck.
It wasn’t pinkie with its lightning kick,
Nor rum, nor, square-face gin, nor barley bree,
But Dr. Arthur’s temperance rhetoric
That sozzled these enthusiasts. Ah me!
A beverage that seems to do the trick
Quite as effectively as eau tie vie
And earns disturbers of the peace the boot
Is this insidious eau de Pussyfoot.

The Commonwealth’s biggest rubber-manu-
facturing co. has not found conditions so easy
as its optimistic Board anticipated. The
reconstruction in 1920 was the third in eight
years, and as big parcels of bonus scrip
were delivered to shareholders in each of
the three reconstructions, the management
has been hard put to it to find fair rates of
divs. for the inflated share-register during
the years of declining values and of restricted
and highly competitive markets. The fol-
lowing table shows how capital has been ex-
panded by new cash-paid issues and bonus
scrip since early in the co.’s career :

The early ordinaries were goodwill shares,
issued against patent rights, etc., and their
divs. stopped at 9 p.c. The prefs. were 7 p.c.
cumulative, but all profits over and above
the ordinaries’ 9 p.c. went to them. For
every £lOOO of the original prefs., in three
reconstructions shareholders put in £l7BO
more, and for their £2780 they now hold
£2OOO of 10 p.c. cum. prefs. and £2560 of
ordinaries. Most of the bonus scrip
was. provided from accumulated profits
which shareholders might have taken
as they were earned. In the 1920 recon-
struction, however, approximately £170,000
of gift shares were produced by writ-
ing up belongings, and, as things have
turned out. the co. would have been stronger
if the old book values had not been disturbed.
li. tin l past three years the management has
been obliged to do much writing-down to get
stock values into line with, the lowered mar-
ket values current. That has affected pro-
fits, and the divs. on ordinary capital, much
of it subscribed in cash at par, - have aver-
aged only 6 p.c. p.a. for the three' years.
The curtailment has not worried old holders,
of course; that rate on the shares they
bought and on those which were presented
to them, plus their pref. interests, gives a
handsome return. But some newcomers paid
several shillings premium in the market on
the strength of the optimism of the directors
in the reconstruction.
The 10 p.c. divs. on the prefs. have taken
£156,000 in three years and the ordinaries’
divs. £210,818: and after paying away
£366,81S altogether only a visible trifle of
£13,299 has been left for reserves. How-
ever, taking into consideration all the diffi-
culties of the period, the Dunlop Rubber Co.
has done remarkably well. In view of the
fact that tin* slump hit the co. just after it
had capitalised all its visible reserves, it
would not have been a surprise if the sud-
den depreciation of values of its large stocks
had resulted in large deficiencies at balancing
time. That was the general experience in
the industry throughout the world, and this
co.’s smaller competitors in the Commonwealth
were not exceptions. It is reasonable to con-
clude, therefore, that, though all visible re-
serves were capitalised in the 1920 recon-
struction, the management had looked with a
cold eye on its stock values during the period
of high prices, and had a good margin to
come and go on when the market crashed. In
addition, the co. appears to have been singu-
larly fortunate in marketing the stocks it
manufactured from costly materials. At
June 30. 1921. stocks had a book value
within a few thousands of 14 million, and
liabilities of £829.255 had piled up. While
the profits shown in the introductory table
have been earned, stocks have been worked
down to less .than half, and at the latest
balance liabilities were only £164,110. In
the face of these remarkable movements, the
div. record has indeed been a very creditable
performance.
Several new problems have confronted the
Australian rubber-manufacturing industry
lately. The most serious has been the effec-
tive assault on local industry by foreign
manufacturers of chassis, who insist that
Australian distributors shall sell their
machines shod with tyres of foreign manu-
facture. This clever move has broken down
the effectiveness of the tariff, and while the
foreign tyre is thus forced on the Austra-
lian purchaser the expensive Tariff Board
has displayed its uselessness to the local in-
dustry by refusing to interfere, thus allow-
ing the foreign manufacturer to defeat the
Commonwealth’s policy of protecting its in-
dustries. Meanwhile, the rapid development
of the world’s rubber industry had created
another problem : the co. decided to cater for
the cord-tyre trade, and considerable outlay
was required for new plant and experimental
work. The result, according to the directors,
has been that “a cord cover equal to the
world’s best has been evolved.”
The following comparisons of balance-sheet
figures goes back to the year prior to the
second reconstruction :

Goodwill 180,000 180,000 180,000 180,000
The co.'.s position at June 30 was very
snug. There were liquid assets, including
stocks at “bedrock” valuations, exceeding all
outside liabilities by £763,369. The outlook
for the 10 p.e. prefs. seems bright: their
divs. require £52,000 p.a., and their capital
is strongly, secured. The management’s dif-
ficulty is to earn reasonable divs. for the
ordinaries, of which, owing to the recon-
structions. there are 1,171,842 £1 fuily-paids.
To pay 10 p.c. on all shares net earnings of
£170,000 p.a. will be required. Everything
has gone so easily during the difficult period
that, barring accidents, ordinaries may
reasonably hope for something more than,
they have had lately.
Foggitt, I ones. Ltd., ham- and bacon-
eurers, packers, canners, etc., who took over
an old-established business in 1921 and paid
£30.000 for goodwill. Goodwill and £9647 of
preliminary exes, made up the deficit to begin
with :

*lB months.
Note, for a start, that the 1922 accounts
covered a period of IS months. The past
year’s profits were approximately £6500 less
than the average for 12 months disclosed by
the first accounts. The div. rates were low-
ered a point, but apparently that was du*»
not so much to the smaller profits as to the
pressure ou finances following on the rapid
expansion of the business. Divs. of 10 p.c.
all round would have required approximately
£2850 more; by distributing only 9 p.e. the
directors were able to put aside £9153. Inci-
dentally. tlm published accounts announced
much larger profits for the two accounting
periods than those given in the introductory
table : from the £58,600 for 1922 and £50,379
for the past year the “Wild Cat” has de-
ducted taxation charges and provisions for
tax-assessments, and has also taken into
account minor movements of reserves. The
operations for the 21 years since the co. took
over have been so successful that, besides
paying 10 p.c. for 1922 and 9 p.c. for the
past 12 months, surpluses have wiped out the
whole of the establishment costs of £9647
and covered the £30.000 paid for goodwill
with almost another thousand to spare.
The float was an unusually attractive one.
Though goodwill was taken in at £30.000,
the old co.’s assets were transferred on a
basis considerably less than their then cur-
rent value, goodwill being covered in this
way several times over. Consequently, the
prefs. were given better security than the
prospectus figures indicated, and the con-
servative values placed upon their belongings
by the vendors—-thus reducing their scrip
allotment—has in a measure been respon-
sibly for the prefs. receiving more than
their minimum 8 p.c. That rate is cumula-
tive. but they follow ordinaries to 10 p.c.
The following table shows how balance-
sheet figures have moved since the issue of
the prospectus:—

Maoriland end of the old business, an asso-
ciated concern over which the. parent co.
had an option at flotation. At June 30 the
£lOO,OOO of prefs. were backed by £127,000
surplus of stocks, book debts and cash over
and above all external liabilities, £156,912
of fixed assets and £30,659 interest in other
cos.—altogether nearly three guineas of
assets for every £1 of prefs.

The whole of the eo.’s issued capital—43.B2o
£1 fuily-paids—is now held by the parent
Chamber of Manufactures, which occupied a
commanding ground-floor position in the float
nine years ago. The enterprise was started
with five objectives: (1) to undertake manu-
facturers’ insurances at lowest rates consis-
tent with sound underwriting; (2) to assist
the parent Chamber financially ; (3) to estab-
lish suitable premises for the Chamber; (4)
to assist the parent body to buy in the
shares; and (5) to pay a good rate of in-
terest on funds put up by members to further
ali other objects. The enterprise was suc-
cessful from the word go; besides having
developed into a very solid little underwriter
for its constituents, it has made a present
of the whole of the business to the Chamber
of Manufactures, which, in divs. and com-
mission, has received £42,245 against the
total paid capital of £43,820. In addition it has
paid policy-holders cash bonuses amounting to
£151.775 which “would otherwise have be-
come a charge on their undertakings,” it
has put the parent Chamber in possession
of commodious headquarters which are in
no way encumbered, and from the beginning
it paid 10 p.c. on the money which estab-
lished it. The introductory table shows
the profits made and details the vari-
ous appropriations. The £118,615 of
reserves now in hand are subject to provi-
sion for unexpired risks; £52,024 was ear-
marked for that purpose in the accounts, but
on a 40 p.c. basis only £44,237 was required.
So in addition to the handsome distributions
each year, since 1914 more than £74.300 of
surplus profit has accumulated. These re-
serves put the concern on firm foundations
in another respect: total funds are equal
to 147.7 p.c. of last year’s net premium in-
come, which is only a couple of points below
the standard proportions in proprietaries
doing their business wholly with outsiders.

The loss-rate throughout has been favorable,
the co-operative nature of the Concern, and
the influence of the parent Chamber, having
given it good-class business. The outstand-
ing feature of operations has been the low
expense-rate; in most years it has been
about one-third of the outgo in most insur-
ance offices. The loyalty of Vic. manufac-
turers to their own insurance co. and the
minimum of trouble they have given man-
ager Seabrook have been responsible for
most of the splendid profits which have
shown up. Incidentally, gross premiums
last year amounted to £153,378, and £42.784
of it was taken to re-insure risks.
Investments are nowadays important con-
tributors to revenue. At June 30 there were
£79,659 of Commonwealth and State secu-
rities on the books, freehold property (at
cost), £78,663, and £40.000 of other invest-
ments not specified. The public securities
turned in £3041-odd interest, and rents and
other returns £10,269. The Chamber of
Manufactures Insurance is easily the most
successful co-operative fire, marine and acci-
dent office in the Commonwealth. There
have been other co-op. and so-called mutual
offices which prospered, but most of them
sooner or later developed into straight-out
proprietaries bent on seeking profits from
the. other fellow. This one promises to
maintain its co-operative nature : during the
past year if reduced workers’ compensation
rates in some industries, and everything
worked out so well that, the customary
bonuses were also paid. Rebates in that
branch last year wen 1 30 p.c. of premiums;
and in addition to 15 p.c. discount on
marine premiums 15 p.c. more was allowed
on inter-State business and 10 p.c. on over-
seas. Motor-car insurers were rebated 10
p.c. of their premiums, and 20 p.c. of pre-
miums from public risk, plate-glass, fidelity-
guarantee. personal-accident and sickness
and boiler-explosion premiums were returned

Investors are interested in the profs, only:
when Leggo’s old business was converted into
a public co. to raise funds for expansion,
30,000 S p.c. cum. profs, were underwritten
by the Dyason L’t.v., and the old owners took
ordinaries for their assets, including good-
will ; for the latter they were issued 40,000
fully-paid 10s. shares. In the introductory
table goodwill has not been treated as an
asset, and £20,000 of the deficit is accounted
for by that item. The co. had a bad buffeting
when the canning industry had its record
reverse, following upon the cessation of war-
contracts and in the subsequent depressed
markets, and the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s control of sugar added to its troubles.
The net loss of £12,836 for 1922 was the
first set-back of the kind Leggo’s had experi-
enced in its 40 years, and as only small
reserves had accumulated since the establish-
ment of the new co. in 1918, P. and L.
account was £12,364 to the bad at June 30,
1922. The directors. decided to straighten
out things by writing down ordinary capital,
but trading prospects showed definite signs
of improvement a little later, so they de-
ferred reconstructing and hope to make pro-
fits cover the deficiency. The past year's
operations wiped out considerably more than
half of it, and at June 30 only £5452 had
to be made good.
The following table gives additional de-
tails:—- ; ,

1922 . . 13,157 25,993
1923 .. 34,702 27,791
Last year’s surplus of sales over and above
manufacturing exes., etc., was the largest to
date. The improvement came wholly from a
bigger turnover; office and other overhead
charges were heavier. The directors report
that marketings continue to improve, and
they “confidently anticipate” that the current
year will see the end of the eo.’s troubles.
The effect of the decision not to reconstruct
has been that, although operations have
again become profitable, neither prefs.
nor ordinaries can receive divs. The
distributions to prefs. are merely deferred —
—they have cumulative rights. At the
close of the current year £7200 (24 p.c.)
will be owing to them, and that amount
must be paid before the old proprietors can
get a look in. The prefs. apparently have
no reason to be concerned. The following
comparisons show balance-sheet movements
since the first accounts were issued and also
reveal the security for the prefs.:—

At June 30 there were stocks, book debts
and cash assets exceeding all trading liabili-
ties by £59,106, and properties and plant
with a book value of £21,686. Altogether
there were assets set down as worth £80,792
to protect £30,000 of prefs. and £7200 of
divs. which will be owing by June 30 next.
In view of the results of the past year’s
trading speculators who picked up the scrip
at down to 16s. should do well. If every-
thing goes right some of them have' got in on
the basis of 10 p.c. preference on their pur-
chase price, with rights to accumulated divs.

The lead market is holding well in spite
of the European tangle. Ihe metal is
reported to be pretty well controlled. Some
of the statistic tipsters have been well oft
the scent in their forecasts lately- -^^, eie 1
a tremendous demand for lead for storage
batteries for motor-cars and for radio work,
and this demand is likely to develop consider-
ably Henry Ford is now equipping his car
With a battery, and it would take the entire
output of a mine as big as the B. H. .North
or South to supply the lead required on
Ford cars alone. Zinc is firm, but the price
of the metal does not affect earnings of
Broken Hill cos. unless it be through in-
creased divs. from their holdings m Electro-
lytic Zinc. All Broken Hill zincs go through
the British Board of Trade at fixed prices.
* * * *
Since the first announcement of the pro-
posed purchase of the British mine by the
North Co., North g.-m. George Weir has
made an inspection of the British, and his
staff has been running the tape over its ore
reserves. For purposes of the sale ore re-
serves are figured at 824,000 tons, and there
is to be an adjustment if they are 10,000
tons or more short. There is room for an
interminable argument on this point, because
in a mine like the British it is most diffi-
cult to say where the ore begins and leaves
of! in most places. Broken Hill anticipates
that as soon as the deal is finalised there
will be an increased output at the North and
a, partial closing down of the British. Ore
from the latter mine needs much finer grind-
ing than North material, and treatment to
give maximum extractions is one of the pro-
blems ahead of the North. In the past that
co. has undertaken comparatively little re-
search work; it has taken advantage of the
pioneer work of other mines to the fullest
extent. The North has also been noted for
keeping its salaried staff down to minimum
in numbers, so British officers are naturally
not elated with the prospects of the North
control.
* * * *
The secrecy which was observed at the
B. H. North in connection with the cutting
of the lode at 1550 ft. induced the public to
anticipate that it was something good. Sub-
sequent diamond drilling necessitated more
anxious supervision than would have been
necessary had the core been solid gold. It
is believed in the Hill that besides the drill
runners the diamond-drill core was seen
by only one official of the mine. The fact of
the reported grade being so remarkably close
to the mine average is regarded as one of
the most extraordinary features in Barrier
developments yet seen. From statements
made by miners who struck the lode it was
anticipated that a substantially richer assay
than the 1400 ft. level showed would have
been obtained.

The B. H. Central fire is still serious.
After a period during which the mine was
sealed up and water curtains kept going, an
examination of the workings last week
showed that the water has not beaten the
fire. Smoke and flames were seen, but a
complete examination is hindered by the
caving-in of workings. The pouring in
of Avater only achieves haphazard results,
because it follows the easiest path through
the stopes and broken country. Very little
water may actually reach a mine fire.
* * * *
Sales of Wallaroo and Moonta shares at as
low as Bs. reflect the desperate position at
the mine. Copper at £6O is no tonic to a
concern struggling with the added costs of
deep workings, dear fuel, award wages and
miscellaneous disabilities. In 1913, with
copper at £77, shares were marketable at
445.; in 1916 copper at £153 saw shares soar
to 71s. 9d.; and in 1920 copper at £122 10s.
kept shares at 575. At June 30, 1922, there
was a loss for the 12 months of £100,356,
and this was reinforced with £77,801 on the
wrong side at June 30 this year. A total
debit at profit and loss of £103,243, an over-
draft of £137,543, and the sale of £83,000
worth of S.A. Treasury deposits are. among
the outstanding after-effects of keeping the
mine at work. Since then the.co. has gone
further towards the brink. The directors,
however, are buoyed up a little by the hope
that the deeper ground may eventually wipe
out the ugly-looking accumulations on the
wrong side.
Developments at the Vimy Ridge, near
Bega (N.S.W.). appear to warrant all the
enthusiasm of the promoters. Manager Ire-
land announces the cutting of the Tanja
cross-reef in the tunnel, where the walls are
Avell defined on a 6ft. lode carrying good
values. At No. 3 shaft, on the cap of the
hill, the reef has Avidened to sft., and values
continue over 3oz. per ton at 30ft. The
11,000 shares reserved for original sub-
scribers at 2s. are to be issued without delay
in order to provide funds for driving No. 2
tunnel, which is expected to give 300 ft. of
backs on cutting the reefs. The first 5-head
of stamps should be in commission early next
month.

Last Aveek the law courts were called upon
to straighten out the affairs of the Carter’s
Hill G.-M. Co., Rockley (N.S.W.), the show
Avhich Sydney Stock Exchange refused to list
last year. Along with Carthew and Nash, two
of the directors, Earle Herman endeavored to
muster a gathering of shareholders, hoping
by proxies to secure a vote of confidence.
Justice Harvey granted the remaining direc-
tors an injunction proscribing such meeting,
ordered Herman to deliver up the records to
J. T. Walton, the new secretary, and ad-
judged Herman, Nash' and Carthew the
proper trio to pay costs.
At present Westralia seems to have nothing
more exciting to offer than an invitation to
put cash into long-abandoned mines. The Sand
Queen and the adjoining Gladsome, at Comet
Vale, and the Gnarlbine, near Coolgardie, are
the latest. The Sand Queen and Gladsome
were good shows in their day, and were
worked by men Avho knew most of what is
worth knowing about ore-raising and treat-
ment. Eventually the Sand Queen, the
better of the two, became unprofitable, and
the owners were thinking of giving up when
a saline deluge overwhelmed them and decided
the matter. The Gladsome, although sunk
only 500 ft. against 800 ft. reached by Sand
Queen, was not spared, and for both mines
the flood proved a complete wash-out. Since
then the mainshaft has become unfit for
use, and the underground workings gen-
erally are messed up horribly. Investors are,
therefore, faced with a new developmental
scheme, a pumping plant to deal with a heavy
inflow of water that approaches in density
that of the Dead Sea. What for? To have
a look at a concern that had reached such a
stage that its owners were prepared to part
with it, without its machinery, for a good
shirt.
Sydney proposes to subscribe cash to clear
the cobAvebs out of the old Gnarlbine, thrown
up 25 years ago, and now, naturally, in a
state of subsidence. Brushing up the old
Gnarlbine may prove a payable venture, but
investors who put tbeir money into such
shows on a chance of the old gold-hunters
leaving behind anything worth taking away
are putting their money on a long shot. Flow-
eA r er, this is the gambling season, and a rank
outsider sometimes gets home.

Brown’s Reward (W.A.) has issued a
number of official reports that have made
shareholders think hard, but its latest is a
classic. It announces that the vendor has,
without consideration, graciously extended
the current option for six months. In
order to fully appreciate this act of gener-
osity it is only necessary to recall that the
vendor paid £2500 for the show, and a few
months later passed it on to Brown's Re-
ward Co. for £lO,OOO cash (about £2500 of
which has been paid him) and 40,000 shares,
some, if not all, of which have also been
handed over. Some shareholders have been
rude enough to ask why so much purchase
consideration has been parted Avith prior to
the option being exercised.
Devon (W.A.) has again fallen far short
of directors’ anticipations. The trouble on
this occasion is not stated. Shareholders
two years ago were told that the show “would
give larger returns than most mines could
count upon, and would pay divs. before
long” ; but in March last they were invited
to pay further calls on the strength of the
ne\v manager finding highly payable ore
where the late manager dolefully reported
there was none. The Devon is like many
another small gold-mine in the West: its
Avorking has benefited the State, but not
shareholders.
* * # #
Sons of Gwalia (W.A.) has now replaced
the mill destroyed by fire in 1921 by a 25-
head plant, and is having a Parliamentary
guzzle to mark the resurrection. For a start
it is proposed to treat 7000 tons of selected
ore per month. Since the closure the re-
treatment of accumulated residues has en-
abled the co. to make a little over and above
the £l5OO a month required to maintain the
mine in good order.
* * * *
In the past the market, instead of the
mine, appeared to count most with the
Adelaide Board of Ives Reward (W.A,),
but a welcome change seems to have taken
place. Negotiations for the purchase and
erection with borrowed money of a mill have
been unexpectedly stopped by the Board until
further tests are made on the ores and until
a water-supply is also assured. Meanwhile,
shareholders had better be prepared for more
calls.
Some months ago a weird application was
made by an unnamed co. for a monopoly
OA'er all abandoned claims on the Westralian
goldfields. Prospectors throughout the State
protested, and Mines Minister Scaddan.
Avhen appealed to, said he Avould consider
the matter. The information has now
leaked out that Scaddan has turned down
the offer.
* * * *
Justice Starke’s recent decision in the
West that a prospector is one who explores
a region for minerals and endeavors to estab-
lish their existence, and that the term can-
not apply to a lease-pegger or jumper who
comes later, means a loss of about £7OOO
to Jock Thomson, mining-man and M.L.A.
Thomson secured the forfeiture of the Yampi
Sound iron deposits, which had been shep-
herded by a Sydney co., and sold them to
the Queensland Government. The Taxation
Commissioner assessed him for income-tax
on the sale, and Thomson appealed to the
High Court on the ground that he was a
prospector within the meaning of the Act.
Edna May Central, Westonia (W.A.j, is
now in the hands of working miners. Above
the 75ft. level there is an unusual alluvial
deposit which may prove payable with eco-
nomical working. There are also numerous
narrow quartz-veins and remnants of the
Edna May and Central lodes which should
yield payable results for working parties.
Below the 75ft. level there is the deluge
which settled the field.
Someone in Westralia claims to dis-
covered a nitrate deposit near Perth “as
good as those in Chile.” It is reported to
contain up to 17 p.c.
* * * *
The latest news from the Lagoon Creek,
West Leichhardt (Q.), bears out the roseate
forecasts of a few weeks back. NeAv men
are drifting in and taking up a lot of
ground, and rough prospecting work shows a
strongly mineralised belt for 10 miles, which
may give rise ultimately to a field of the
first importance. The lodes occur in schists
and quartzites of an age undecided as yet, but
possibly to be correlated with the pre-Cam-
brians of Broken Hill. The ores now being
found have a certain likeness to those of
the early days of the Barrier. Friable native
silver has made its appearance, and assays
go as high as OOOOoz. to 7000 oz. in some
cases. The field is in a dry district and ter-
ribly remote at present, so the early birds
are having a rough time; but these draAv-
backs can only be considered temporary, such
is tbe promise of good things to come. The
development stage has not yet arrived, but
this should be pushed on without delay to
ascertain if railway construction and local
treatment plants are warranted. According
to geologist St. Smith, the big Chillagoe find
is a lode, whereas the West Leichhardt is a
field.
Queensland’s gold yield of 75530 z. (fine)
for September is disappointing: it was prac-
tically all Mt. Morgan (63050 z.). Gympie
has dropped to the Towers level with the
demise of the Scottish. Ravenswood turned
out 2820 z. as against nothing for September,
1922. Mt. Coolon crushings were small, and
Clark’s, at Charters Towers, is finding pay-
ore increasingly difficult to get. While the'
yield for (nine months) is still 8371
ounces aheaaof that for the same period of
1922, it has certainly not come up to the
early expectations of the Mines Department.
All fields except Mt. Coolon are looking blue.
Good coal prospects are reported from
Allora, near Warwick (Q.), practically on
the main railway line. Prospecting Avork has
revealed three seams, one of Avhich runs to
6ft. of fairly clean coal. Having completed
initial prospecting work, the syndicate is on
the track of cash with the object of equip-
ping the mine and commencing production.
The coal is declared to be a good gas fuel,
and eliminating a couple of bands in the
main seam it should run only a small per-
centage of ash. The find is about the most
favorably situated on the line between Too-
woomba and Stanthorpe. Tannymorel, at
present the only producing colliery there-
abouts, is on a branch line out of Warwick.
The Great Northern, at Ilerberton (N.Q.),
has 60 tons going through the mill. The last
60 tons gave 7 tons 4cwt. of black tin. Pro-
duction should be speeded up in the next
couple of months, as the cleaning-up of old
workings and development are both receiving
attention. Prospects continue good.
Bad news instead of oil has leaked out in
the Mersey Valley (Tas.). The bore at the
Hermitage, which has been Avrestling with
hard rock at about 400 ft., is said to be in an
igneous formation. Officially it is reported
that the Russian Captain de Hautpick, the
co.’s consulting-engineer, had classed the
rock as sedimentary; but the slowness with
Avhich the drill went down gave the directors
such concern that they called in a Melbourne
analyst and mineralogist. He broke the
news that the section was from an igneous
formation. The Speck geologist confirmed
the diagnosis. So.a diamond drill was got
to work. This is down to 600 ft. and the
head-driller says it is in diabase. De Haut-
pick has resigned, and a Yank oil-geologist
of note is on his way out to advise.
Coorong Oil Co. has engaged Captain de
Hautpick to superintend its boring opera-
tions near Salt Creek, Coorong. A small
diamond drilling plant capable of going to
500 ft. will be used for test bores. A con-
tract has been let to the Goldfields Diamond
Drilling Co. to drill three holes to a maxi-
mum depth of 900 ft. each. As the first bore
at Albert Flat, on the Ninety Mile Desert,
drilled in 1891 left off in crystalline lime-
stone at 922 ft., these holes will probably be
too shallow to reach oil sands if they do
exist. The late Boverton Redwood, long
recognised as the doyen of British petroleum
technologists, Avrote in September, 1891,
strongly urging the directors of the South
Australian Petroleum Fields Co. to go on
boring; he considered that the evidence and
samples placed before him warranted deeper
sinking.
From the sale of its Bundi tin concession
at a book profit of £11,385, Malaya Tin Cor-
poration wiped out £4319 at debit of profit
and loss and carried £3OOO forward at credit
for the financial year ended December last.
In the report just issued C. H. Kerry en-
thuses over Bundi prospects and also those
of Takuapa Y r alley, both offshoots of the
Corp. The former is in the State of Tre-
gennau, where other concessions are now
being prospected. Siberian interests are
being shepherded until the weather breaks.
The manager has been to Moscow, and appa-
rently had about reached a working agree-
ment with Lenin when typhoid-fever put him
out of action for the time being. Meantime
the Corp. continues payment of rent for its
leases in the Altai mountains.
Cyril W. Gudgeon, who followed J. D.
Millen as g.-m. of Mt. Bischoff when the
latter became a Speck Senator, recently
wearied of and retired from the strenuous
job of trying to squeeze profits from the
very low-grade material the old tin wonder
offers in its declining days. But Gudgeon
is back in the mining game ; he is now on his
way north to report on a tin proposition in
Johore for a Melbourne syndicate.

“10-2-4” on the Anzac in Art: —
Of the many fatuities given to tne London press
on the subject of the Australian Art Exhibition the
most futile was surely the complaint that the pic-
tures showed none of the dash and verve England
had learned to expect of Australians. Where was
the Anzac touch ? Nowhere at Burlington House had
the critic been able to find a Trumper. The
“Anzac touch” is something concrete, which is demon-
strated conclusively by the habit of routing the
THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT.
HUBBY: “How did Phyllis's chap turn out? I remember
he promised her a fine house with large grounds
in the country."
WIFEY : "Oh, he did better than that. He gave her a
ducky flat with large grounds for divorce in town."
enemy, just, as the Trumper touch is a matter of
regularly my king runs at a speedy rate. But how
can such qualities be presented in a work of art?
And even if ; the feat is possible, who may be trusted
to identify them? Out of any dozen self-styled
experts no two will read the same intention into a
picture, or Agree with reasonable closeness as to its
merits or otherwise. We are all —British and Aus-
tralian—at one about the beauty of a Macartney
century. How many can honestly express delight over
(say) Augustus John’s “Smiling Artilleryman”? The
truth is art criticism is largely cant and humbug
undertaken by persons who have never toiled at the
trade about which they dogmatise, but who make up
in effrontery what they lack in knowledge. Reputa-
tions are foisted on the public by these impostors,
not necessarily because the particular man boomed
is meritorious, but on the principle that certain
changes in clothing are insisted on by the tailors—
because it is good for business that fashions alter.
Looking back over the period between the first
Sargent I ever saw and the latest John, I can
recall some 15 or 20 entirely new art movements,
each of which was hailed by the critics as a develop-
ment that would endure, and each of which had its
masters beside whom the Old Masters appeared pri-
mitive and inept. Such of those movements as are
net dead are dying. The new masters are half, or
wholly, forgotten. The old ones live on. In other
words, the opinion of those who talk loudest and most
authoritatively about art are valueless and have been
in every age. Add particularly in London, where, in
the phrase of a Nation and Athbhotb which
reached me last week, “the Royal Academy flounders
in the mud of universal contempt.”
“Ashmead”: Great girls, these busli
nurses! A laborer in the far north-west
of the Speck nearly severed his foot the
other day with an erring swing of the axe.
His cobber, without waiting to saddle the
prad, galloped off for the bush nurse, some
live miles away. He reached her residence
and babbled out that his mate Was bleeding
to death. The nurse’s horse was away down
the paddock, so she grabbed her kit, swung
her leg across the bareback steed which had
carried the messenger, and flew off to the
rescue. Won’t some poet sing the praises
of the bush nurse?
“George Rich”: Permit me to introduce
the obliging policeman. Periodically the
John Hop in our W.AJ. township has to
make a trig up-country and take into cus-
tody a chap who makes a habit of disre-
garding a certain order. On the last trip
the Law was returning to the railway
station with his quarry, when a deputation
of outbackers sought an interview’. . They
were holding a fancy-dress ball that night,
and their regular musician had failed them.
Would the constable do the community the
special favor of delaying his journey home
until next morning so that the prisoner,
who was always ready to officiate at such
functions at a pinch, might coax music
from an accordion for the jazzers? The
gent in blue acquiesced, the ball was a
gratifying success, and the crowd, prepar-
ing for home at daylight, closed the pro-
ceedings with three cheers for the accommo-
dating officer.
“Solomon M.”: So far as I can learn, the
Methodists and the Communists are the only
people in or around Sydney who are really
cross about the interference of the Govern-
ment with highway preach-
ing and screeching on the
footpaths. One Methody,
who was typical of the
objectors in general, grew
quite military about the
matter the other day, and
said: “We will not light’y
surrender the priceless heri-
tage for which our ances-
tors shed their blood—free
speech.” The trouble seems
largely caused by an in-
ability to move with the
times. The date of the
bloodshedding is a long way
back, and they didn't, win at
the sword’s point the right
tq gather crowds on the
tramline or the pavement to
hearken to their eloquence.
There were no trams then,
and there was nothing worth
calling a real pavement in
all Christendom. There is a
tine old flavor about the
Puritan Fathers who re-
vdlted against the Star
Chamber and the Inquisi-
tion. But in neither Old
England nor New England
did these dauntless patriots
wrest from the sons of
Belial an acknowledgment
that they might gather con-
gregations in the streets of
a city even half the size of
Sydney, for there was none,
and. nobody dreamed that
there would be one. Free
speech is doubtless a great
thing, though if one tried to
use it in a Communist hall
he would be thrown out;
and if ho tried it in
a Methodist tabernacle h e would be arrested
ioi* disturbing “divine” service; and if he
put his case in. writing and sent it to the offi-
cial paper of either crowd the editor would
put it in the waste-paper basket unless it
fully agreed with his views.

“Tauwarra”: The Government inspector
was visiting Bill’s Papuan plantation. He
lined up the “boys,” took their tempera-
tures, and asked if they had any complaints;
then he inspected the sleeping quarters,
tested the drinking water, examined the
cooking-pots, and nosed around generally
with a magnifying-glass in one hand and
a scent-spray in the other. The upshot was
that the place got a clean bill of health,
“Fine place you’ve got here,” remarked the
inspector, as he packed his swag. “Yairs,”
agreed Bill, “not too bad.” “Wonderful

place,” enthused the inspector. “Any
pests?” “Oh, no,” drawled Bill, wearily,
“on’y you blokes!”
“Ex-Dig.”: Fate’s tendency to introduce
farce —French farce at that—into its worst
tragedies was illustrated by the case of the
European lady in Tokio who was in her bath
when the earthquake came, and was pitched,
bath and all, uninjured in anything except
her sense of propriety, into the amazed crowd
in the street. The incident recalls to me a
scene in France, when a big shell landed
right alongside a bath-house in the outskirts
of Poperinghe. It arrived during a Tommy
bath-parade. Probably the disturbed citizens
who rushed out of near-by houses were too
scared to notice; but a group of Diggers
cheered heartily when a soore of Atkinses, as
naked as the takers of Lungtungpen in Ivip-
ing’s story, streaked across the landscape
looking for cover. Even the fact that the
shell had done some devastating work could
not dispel the pure joy of the incident.
“The Rumpus”: Here’s a three-act tra-
gedy. A woman visited a furnishing shop
in Perth and ordered a handsome double-bed.
She confided to the salesman that it was
a luxury she had set her heart on ever since
she was married, but that she and her hus-
band had never been able to finance the pur-
chase before. “Send it to-morrow—it is to
be a surprise for him,” was her final
injunction. The following morning she
rang up and cancelled the order. “But
wait,” said the salesman, “I’m sure you won’t
get a better article anywhere else.” “I
wasn’t worrying about that,” came the lady’s
tearful voice. “It’s simply that I don’t need
it any longer. My husband cleared out with
—with another woman last night.”
“S.E.O.’s” squatter and the gloves:—
MaeSquattah “broke it” with some of the o 1 if
crowd on his first day down for the Spring meeting,
and as a peace offering' for Mrs. Mac. he returned
to the hotel with a pair of three-guinea gloves. If
there is anything the lady detests more than hic-
coughs it is extravagance, and she had some score
for complaint in both directions. Next morning she
left for the dentist’s wearing the gloves, having
first taken the precaution to impound Mac.’s cheque-
book and to threaten him with dire penalties if
he should leave the hotel before her return. With
an old friend, Mac. was waiting when his better
half re-appeared, but it was she who was in
trouble this time. “I’ve left those gloves in the
tram,” she shrilled; “run after it quick and get
them!” Mac. and his friend did their best —
they caught the next tram, and at the terminus
learned that if any gloves had been left in the
tram “somebody must ha’ pinched ’em.” “Go and
buy another pair; get the girl to stretch them
and take them back as the originals,” said Mac.’s
friend; and backed his advice with the loan of the
necessary sum on being apprised of the emptiness
of the squatter’s pocket. Lightheartedly Mac. re-
turned with the gloves; but the storm of the pre-
ceding day was nothing to what struck him this
time. Yet it was hardly his fault that the gloves
had been left at the dentist’s and not in the tram,
and that a messenger had already arrived to restore
them to their owner. He is still separated from
his cheque-book.
“Hamer”: Sydney’s medical students seem
to be careless beggars, addicted to leaving the
human bones they have been dissecting about
the yard, or giving them inadequate sepul-
ture under rose-bushes. The discovery of
such gruesome relics has stirred several sub-
urbs to excitement lately, the first presump-
tion naturally being that the bones will be
found to have some bearing on “the Coogee
case” ; the ensuing discovery almost always
is that a "deputy sawbones” formerly lived
on the premises where the remains came to
light. The medical student of to-day has
no more sentiment about spare parts than
Bob Sawyer and Ben Allen might have been
expected to display: but he ought to be
tidier —especially in a city where the police
are always prospecting for somebody’s van-
ished body.
“The Lamb” : Do you remember that war-
time cartoon of London after the Aussies had

well on the bend from the persistent pressure
of the leaning Digger on leave. My hope-
ful has inherited the spirit that won the war.

YEARNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You are always quarrelling about your meals.
I feel that I have a yearning for higher things.”
—Letter quoted in Sydney divorce case
The anchorites of old well knew
What they might get from pious fasting.
They did without their food and grew
A zeal for matters everlasting.
They felt a hollowness within,
Whilst hunger at their vitals burning
Convinced them they had conquered sin,
And they were filled with holy yearning.
Full often when a couple, sprawled
In some sequestered love-nook, lingers
Long after tea-time’s bell has called,
With arms entwined and lacing fingers,
They think the ache their beings know
Is love a-yearn. In this confusion
With hasty, eager steps they go
And marry in a fond delusion.
Pale saints and lovers may delight
In self deceit, but mundane sinners
With healthy, normal appetite,
Know yearns are mainly yearns for dinners.
A chook’s, | and not an angel’s, wings
Seeks Bill, with hunger in him boring;
Maude thinks she yearns for higher things,
His sordid plea for food deploring.
This is the point we should not miss:
There may be use in hunger’s burnings
In lovers ; ; but domestic bliss
Is often wrecked by empty yearnings.

“Hobnobster”: Aratula (S.Q.) has one
cemetery, the Lutheran. It was founded
this way. “Old Smith,” the local bullocky,
had petered out, and a crowd was gathered
in the pub at Kalbor discussing the virtues,
professional and otherwise, of the lamented.
Somebody suggested it was time Aratula
had a burying-ground of its own. and then
it could abandon' the habit of sending de-
ceased citizens all the way to Kalbor. The
suggestion was approved, as the fair due.of
a growing township, and after some argu-
ment as to which religion should control it,
the Lutherans won on a show of hands.
Thereupon a kindly German offered to dedi-
cate 20 acres for the purpose: and the chaps
who first broached the subject and the donor
of the land were unanimously appointed
trustees. Then, it being closing time, the
crowd went home. This happened 20 years
ago ; and the only graves in the cemetery to-
day are those of the three trustees.

some man your first husband was, you

ments. One happened over a quarrel about
grazing rights between two pastoralists
whose affluence would have made the case
worth while. But they were sports, and
decided t,o toss —two out of three—to see
which should have the benefit of legal advice.
Each had got a leg in, and each was firmly
convinced that securing the lawyer’s services
meant winning the ease, when the idea
occurred to both of them simultaneously
that it would he simpler and cheaper and

quicker to settle the whole dispute by the
third spin. Which they accordingly did,
and all that Six-and-Eight got out of it was
the drink the winner shouted.
“Solomon Malaprop” : Almost exactly half
the population of N. S. Wales, or 1,082,410
people, are crammed into the Sydney sanitary
district, and it, is proudly reported that last
year’s death-rate (not counting that in
benevolent homes) was only 816 per 100.000.
“the lowest ever attained by any city with
a population of over half a million.’ One
queer result of a low death-rate is a low
birth-rate —this is a case in which you can
have it both ways. The first step towards
a record birth-rate is to execute all ladies
aged 50 and over. In fact, ladies of 47 are
not worth their keep in the birth-rate sense,
and they hardly ever give birth to triplets
when past 39. Men ought to be killed off at
60 to 65. If these processes reduced the
population by one-third or one-half, then the
birth-rate would automatically jump from
25 per 1000 to 371 or 50 per 1000. A big
infant mortality would also help, for infants,
not being parents, likewise form a drag on
the statistics. The redeeming feature about
infants, however, is that they are going to
be parents, while centenarians aren’t. So
perhaps we'd better not, kill off the infants.
“Lex”: In a case at Sydney Quarter Ses-
sions last week the Judge warned the jury
against bringing in a verdict of guilty on
the unsupported evidence of all accomplice.
However, the lieges were satisfied with the
case for the Crown, and said so in the cus-
tomary manner. This maddened the de-
fending attorney. He exclaimed in the hear-
ing of the jurors: “An outrageous verdict!
Scandalous!” and in court next morning
said: —
The jury could not have conscientiously brought
in a verdict of guilty if they had paid-attention to
your Honor’s lucid summing-up. Either they were
incompetent, or there was a section among them
determined upon a conviction!”
Then did his Honor uprise in scandalised
indignation as follows :
A most outrageous statement to make! And by
an officer of the court!
I am net sure but that this is contempt of court.
To dare to go out and attack a jury for their
verdict! ' Thgt this should have been done bv an
officer of the court is more than improper.
Even while this was going on the Cockatoo
Dock employees were holding a mass meeting
in which they gave the lie in the most vigor-
ous manner possible to a jury’s verdict on
their collective moral character. True, they
are not officers of the court, but leading
barristers often criticise with impunity the
verdicts of juries, while the most contemp-
tuous of all strictures on the bona fides and
intelligence of the good men and true, as
disclosed by their findings, usually emanate
from Judges. This tendency of the Bench
to fly off the handle about trivialities, while
condoning enormities, is a disquieting fea-
ture of our life.
“The Oldest” : The par. about Hori Grey's
old home at Kawau Island (B. 11/10/’23)
brings to mind Charles Gavan Duffy’s story
(told in the Contemporary Review in the
’eighties) about Lord Carnarvon, Cabinet
Minister and father of the late Egyptologist,
and Grey.. “I am told,” said Carnarvon
to Duffy, who was on a visit to the Cold
Country, “that. Governor Grey lives the life
of a hermit in all respects but one: that
he has shut himself up on an island with
no other companions but wallabies?” Duffy
admitted that Sir George was living in the
seclusion indicated, but pointed out that he
had books and music as well as wallabies.
“Pray, sir,” said the Earl, “how many walla-
bies may there be there?” Duffy stared. “I
don’t suppose he knows that himself,” he
returned. The Earl groaned. “What an
example for a Christian people 1 Morality
must be at a low ebb indeed when a man
like.,you apparently sees nothing reprehen-
sible in such a proceeding!” Duffy stared
harder, and then a light broke in on him.
“What does your Lordship suppose a wal-
laby to be?” he asked, and learned that the
Secretary of State thought it was the Maori
equivalent for the Australian “lubra.”
“Harry J.” : Bill was a battalion cobber
of mine, and the first thing he did when he
returned from the war early in 1919 was
to- serve his wife with divorce papers. Natu-
rally I was surprised a week later to meet
him and the missus looking as happy as most
couples,. although William’s black eye was
clearly a quite recent trophy. A few minutes
later he was explaining matters over a drink.
On receipt of the papers his wife had hur-
riedly written to
assure him that
her venture into
th e business ol'
double housekeep-
ing with a third
party had been a
terrible mistake,
due to the loneli-
ne s s and acute
mental strain occa-
sioned by hey hus-
band’s prolonged
absence. She now
hated Horace, and
she couldn’t con-
demn herself too
much for what she
had done, and she
still lov e d Bill.
The interloper had
done one decent
thin g. he had
bought a cottage in
her name and fur-
nished it. Would
hubby come to her
at once, throw the
man out, lock the
door on the inside and cry quits? “I took it
on,” said Bill as we finished the drinks. I
must have looked harder than I to at
his black eye, for he added, ‘‘He's in
hospital.”
“Esmond”: “Verey Light” doesn't over-
state it when he says that the strongest term
in the Digger’s vocabulary was reserved for
the military policeman. To say that a man
was an m.p., or had been an m.p., was the
deadliest insult one Digger could offer to
another. But not all the Jacks deserved
the hard things said of them. When the
news of the Armistice reached England, our
camp at Warminster (Wilts) marched into
town and declared war on the Provost
Corps. In the course of the disturbance
two Jacks were pursued by a mob of Dig-
gers. When capture seemed inevitable, one
of the policemen halted, and facing his
pursuers told them that he could not fight
all of them at once, but was quite ready
to take on one at a time, if they would
give him a fair deal. A Diveer stepped
forward thirsting for battle. The ensuing
scrap was hard and bitter, but the m.p.
was the better man and eventually downed
his opponent. Then he called for the next
candidate. But the sporting instinct of the
crowd had been touched by their enemy’s
gameness, and he didn’t have to do any more
scrapping.

“Ex-Dig.”: Some statistics dealing with
the death sentences passed upon soldiers
during the war have been released by the
Imperial authorities; they show that out of
5080 men sentenced only 340 were actually
shot, and only five of these came from out-
side the U.K. Thirty-seven got their issue
of bullets for murder. This was the only
offence for which an A.I.F. soldier could
incur the death penalty, and I think there
was only one instance of such a happening,
the culprit having deliberately picked off an
officer he disliked, and subsequently boasted
about it. Some solid sentences were handed out,
nevertheless. Two brothers who held back in
the trench during a hop-over got seven years
each, another 15 years. However, as, when
the war was over, the A.I.F. gathered all
its prisoners from the British military
prisons, and simply set them free with a
“black” discharge when they got to Aus-
tralia, the transgressors got off lightly.
“Old Quack’s” note on Nature’s plans: —
“Vitamine X,” guaranteed to overcome the sterility
of -women in many cases, may be a genuine dis-
covery ; whether, if so, it will operate to the benefit
of the human race is quite another question. A
regular conclave of physicians and herbalists “ad-
vised” the Czarina how to produce a male heir to
the throne; the result was a man-child crippled with
disease from infancy. Sydney once owned a herbalist
who, after effecting some undoubted cures for
sterility, gave up the business because he had con-
vinced himself that in nearly every case where oh
durate Nature had been cajoled, the resulting offspring
•was unfit or malformed, and seldom capable of sur-
viving infancy. Sterility when it results from cer-
tain causes —v.d. for instance —is beneficial to the
race. Also, if the woman who has rendered herself
sterile by a long course of birth-prevention is arti-
ficially made fertile, Nafrure is quite likely to revenge
herself in another way.:
“A.W.” : A “Cross of Sacrifice” has been
unveiled in our little churchyard of St. John
the Evangelist. Sutton Veny (Wilts). It is
a mixed God’s acre: 148 Australians (in-
cluding two nursing sisters), 38 Germans and
26 British sleep there. The first Digger (pro-
bably the first to die in England) was buried

in 1915, some 32 months before the
A.I.F. depot was set up—the local story is
that he was a Gallipoli warrior, transferred
from a Maltese hospital.
"Fax”: Our suburb has had a striking
object-lesson in both the strength and the
weakness of Hickson’s healing. A local iden-
tity, known to everybody by sight, is a youth
who has long shuffled along the street,
bent nearly to the ground, and dragging his
feet laboriously one after the other. The
magnetism of Healer Hickson was effective.
The young fellow attended a mission meeting
to be cured, and believed he was cured. He
stood upright, walked properly, appeared
right as rain. But for a few days only. The
cure lasted hardly longer than Hickson’s
visit. Then the youth resumed his bent form
and shuffling gait. It is precisely this quality
of the “cures” that makes so many earnest
churchmen so disinclined to have the church
mixed up with and judged by these drum-
banging “missions.” They are too much like
the performance of the quack, and the
shoddy-manufacturer, and the jerry-builder—
people who are satisfied so long as they get
paid before their work crumbles to pieces.
SWEET SEPTEMBER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Written in Central Queensland after reading The
Bulletin’s Spring poems.)
Yes, it is September, and Spring should walk the
land
Trailing her green garments, sweet blossoms in
her hair;
Birds should sing rejoicing, a happy mating band :
A joyous sound and color should proclaim Spring
everywhere.
It is, alas, September, but drought holds dreadful
sway!
Spring lies within his clutches —a piteous wilted
thing.
The grass is black and patchy or gone utterly away ;
The birds postpone their mating and quite forget
to sing.
The sound of axe and falling scrub replace the wild
birds’ song,
That and the mocking, gloating call of crows
that seek the feast —
The living feast that helpless lies and suffers : over-
long
’Neath brassy skies that still deny God’s mercy
to the beast.
The waterholes are death-traps, just stagnant,
muddy pools
To which the weary starving stock,, thirst-tortured,
slowly crawl;
And man to greater energy his faltering courage
schools,
In his heart rebellious question of the wherefore
of it all.
Oh, yes, it is September! and while others laugh
and sing,
Rejoicing in the greenness, blue skies and balmy
air,
For us there’s desolation, death and drudgery in the
Spring ;
We search the. skies for clouds and rain, and only
find despair.

Admiral Dudley de Chair will be N. S.

had not influenced the Downing-street heads
against the possibility of offending the coun-
tries concerned. That is why, they say, De

Foreign Office instead of Minister for
Blockade.
Randolph Bedford. M.L.A. —he had an

Moonta Jack Scaddan, Labor Premier of
Westralia from 1911 till 1916, and a mem-
ber of the Coalition Ministry since 1919,
announces his impending retirement from
that position and from the Leg. Assembly.
After the Labor split in 1917 Jack changed
his politics with such rapidity that it be-
came a puzzle to classify him. By turns
he was Labor, Coalition Labor, Independent,
Nationalist (joining the Cabinet as such)
and Country party. He achieved the un-
exampled feat of transmogrifying himself
from Gnash to Cocky without losing his Min-
isterial salary. His decision to retire is
attributed to sheer ennui, there being no more
parties he can join.
John Lewis, of S. Aus., pastoralist, poli-
tician and one of the founders of the big
Bagot, Shakes and Lewis Co., left £125,000.
Gone where Costs are not collectable,
Fred Gannon, Sydney’s oldest solicitor. He
was 87, an Australian native, and had been
in practice since December 17, 1864. Gannon
was devoted to the gun, and for years was
reported to be the “first-snipe man” of the
season. He was a son of Michael Gannon,
a Government contractor, who lived on The
Rocks a century ago, and later owned “Gan-
non’s Forest,” out Cook’s River way.
John Stratton, managing director of Strat-
ton and Sons, who died in Sydney the other
day at 65, milled flour in Cootannindra for
30 years, was an alderman for a quarter of
a century, and Mayor 13 times. He learned
his business with his father in Ballarat, and
the Rowing Club there still talks of the way
he handled an oar in far-off days.
The death of engineer Alfred Cecil Brayne,
with 94 strenuous years to his credit, removes
a citizen who did a lot in linking-up Aus-
tralia. He arrived shortly after the Crimea
War, and saw some excitement while en-
gaged on the Melbourne-Sydney railway
through landowners organising gangs to inter-
fere with the work when it trespassed on
their property, Among the bridges Brayne
helped to build was that over the Hawkesbury.
He was chief inspector on that job.
George Ferguson Bowen, the Vie. Gover-
nor whose name always recalls Black Wed-
nesday to the civil service, loomed as a great
man in the eyes of Alec Peacock just a half-
century ago. When he was 12 Peacock won
a prize in the Smeaton district schools com-
petition, and Bowen handed over to the
future ruler of the Education Department a
cheque (the first he ever saw) for 50s. The
scene was the Smeaton Showground, and the
incident was brought to mind the other day
when John xkllan, the new Cocky Minister
for Lands, steered through his first bill—
one to turn the old showground at Smeaton
into a recreation reserve. Smeaton is part
of Peacock’s Allandale constituency.
“De Carteret”: At the dedication of the
carved throne as a memorial of Westralia’s
John Forrest in St. Paul’s Cathedral. Inn-
don, Lord Denman referred to the Coolgardie
water supply and the Fremantle Harbor
works as being Forrest’s greatest achieve-
ments. Forrest himself did not think so.
Many years ago I had the chance to make
some remarks before a learned society about
Bigjohn’s splendid work as an explorer in
Westralia. The subject of my tribute
was evidently ~ pleased, for he told Alfred
Deakin that he regarded his early explora-
tions as the best work of his career. Deakin
told me that Forrest considered his two jour-
neys in 1871 and 1874—in the second of
which he and his brother Alick reached the
overland telegraph-line from Geraldton—as
excelling anything he had accomplished in
his political career.
“W.G.L.” : Just-dead Sir Herbert Cox, who
commanded the Fourth Division A.I.F. for
some time, was an Anglo-Indian and a good
sport. We first met him at Gallipoli, where
he came with his Ghurkas prior to the Suvla
Bay tragedy, and we knew him better when
the Fourth Division was formed at Tel-el-
Ivebir, again at Serapeum. and best of all
in France. His face wasn’t exactly pleasing
—in fact, it Avould be kind to call it “hard”
--and when surmounted by a tin-hat was
a rather fearsome thing. One day he visited
our front line, and halted to talk to two
Diggers occupying a bay. Then he passed
on. and stopped round the traverse to talk to
some others. One of the first two, unaware that
the General was so near, in a voice that could
be heard half-way to Berlin, asked. “Who’s
that, Bill?” “General Cox.” was the reply.
“Good Gawd!” gasped the first. “What a
bloodthirsty-looking old blank!” In the next
bay a smile split the face of the bloodthirsty-
looking old blank as he said an abrupt “Good
morning” and passed on.
After living all his 91 years in the Rokeby
(Tas.) district, John R. Morrisby went over
the range the other day. His “J.R.M.”
apples were as widely known as his family,
which springs from James Morrisby, one
of those settlers originally holding grants
on Norfolk Island who were removed to the
Speck about 180 S. That old pioneer, who
died at 89. handed down a heritage of
longevity which has since marked the clan.
Ex-Cabinet Minister Arthur Morrisby is a
brother of the deceased apple-grower.
Oswald Henry Lewis, architect, who died
in Sydney recently at 67, came of a family
of architects and draughtsmen. About a cen-
tury ago the pioneer Lewis was town sur-
veyor of Sydney, and was the owner of
Bronte, later the property of Robert Lowe,
afterwards Gladstone’s Chancellor of the
Exchequer. He became Colonial Architect,
and ended up about 1850. Oswald Haddle
Lewis was an architect in the ’fifties, and
Tom Lewis, a brother, became chief draughts-
man in the Survey Office.
John Gardiner, perhaps S.A.’s best-known
civil servant, has been turned down at last.
From 1866 on he did good work in various
State departments; then, when the Common-
wealth was born, he went over as Public
Service Inspector and Controller of Pen-
sions. E. C. Kraegen, of Sydney, moves to
Adelaide to succeed him.

Australian Stakes is an old shepherd at the
far end of Pandurra station (Central Eyre’s
Peninsula, S.A.). While cutting across
from Ft. Augusta to Ivimba, via Iron Knob,
WILLIAM BRUN-
TON, the Mayor-
elect of Melbourne.

his stores being

fence some miles
away. He had
seen a motor-car,
though—a bio u t a

was in the car,
but whoever it was
knew him all right,
because he waved
to him. Ten days
later, on my way
back, I turned in to
see the old boy,
and left some beer
with him. He
hadn’t seen a soul
since I had been
there.
Townsville (Q.) lost a good citizen when
Tom Lowth passed out the other day. A
native of Dublin, he arrived at Maryborough
in 1878, joined the Foorce, and put in many
strenuous years on police duty at Ravens-
wood. Charters Towers, Richmond and else-
where. Then lie handed in his baton to be-
come traffic-inspector at Townsville, and
eventually blossomed out as a Bung, and
from 1897 till a few months ago was the
host of the hotel that bears his name.
James Coates Grant, found dead in his
hut at Adjungbilly (N.S.W.) a day or two
ago, had latterly been a shearers’ cook whose
habit it was to dispense philosophy with the
tucker. He came from an old Scottish
family, was a Cambridge graduate, and in
his younger days was a world-famous athlete
—he was imported into Australia at the time
of the running boom away back in the
’eighties. When the police examined his be-
longings it is said they found papers prov-
ing his claim to a proscribed French title,
he being a lineal descendant of the Vieomte
de Vaux, as well as of the Scottish Baron
Grant. The old chap finished at 72.
“S.T.S.” on a lesser Browning:—
The death of Oscar Browning will loose a flood
of reminiscences in the English papers. A shining
light of King’s College, Cambridge, he was, as I
first met him 40 years ago, a humorous figure.
Everybody was fond of him, but smiled when his
name was mentioned. He was always called
“O 8.,” and skits about obedience and obesity were
always current. The first time I ever saw him he
was in a Union Club debate sticking up for Oscar
Wilde, whose early poems it was proposed to throw
out of the library (Wilde was at that time known
only as poet and pretentious aesthete). The majority
was against 0.8., whose enthusiasm was cried
down by one of the younger men (Austen
Chamberlain, T think) as “mere sympathy for a
namesake.” But the real 0.8. weakness was a
wish to be thought to know everything and
everybody. One great personage was said to have
been described by him as “quite the nicest Em-
peror I have ever met.;” And at one of his Sunday
evenings, when an undergrad sat down to the piano
and played something of his own, warranted never
heard before on any instrument, 0.8. crossed the
room waving his hand to the air and saying,
“Whose is that? I know it so well.” “Schubert,”
lied the player unblushingly. “Ah, Schubert, of
course,” said O.B.; “I know it so well”-—and went
away at peace with himself and the world as usual.
But he did an enormous amount of work in his
long life of 86 years—no man surely has written
more “Lives” (he was for a generation University
Lecturer in History), and he produced half a dozen
“period” histories after he had published his own
“Memoirs of Sixty Years” (1910).
“Gabo” : Uncanny coincidence is bolstering
the superstition that every American Presi-
dent elected in a year that is a multiple of
20 is destined to die in office. Harrison
started the fatal legend by perishing soon
after reaching the White House in 1840. Lin-
coin, chosen in 1860, was assassinated during
his second term. Another murderer finished
Garfield, who was appointed in 1880. In
1900 McKinley became Uncle Sam’s Chief
Executive, and a few months later he fol-
lowed the example of Lincoln and Garfield.
Now the death of Warren Harding, selected
in 1920, has given the strange record a signi-
ficance that history will be compelled to
notice.
"Ah Choom” : Archbish. Sharp of Brisbane
is about the most unepiscopal-looking person
in the dust-ridden city. He generally dresses
in a light grey suit and a similarly colored
soft felt hat, and dodges in and out of the
traffic like a live-wire agent bent on outpac-
ing the minion of a rival firm. It is only
when you get close to him that you notice he
wears a back-to-front collar and has a violet
stock tucked beneath his very secularly-cut
waistcoat. On ceremonial occasions he may
wear the ridiculous gaiters and apron, but
I’ve never yet seen him in them. Sharp is
a lovable man, though some don’t like his
patronage of the frilly ceremonial at All
Saints’ —nearly opposite his own cathedral.
In addition to the £2OOO already voted,
Vic. Premier Lawson is to draw £llOO
for the expenses of his January-July tour
around the world.
Chased his last bill o’ costs, Frank H.
Smith, father of the legal profession in
Mackay (N.Q.). On arriving from Eng-
land in 1844 he was articled to a firm of
solicitors in Brisbane, and 1872 saw his
shingle set up outside a modest little office
in Sydney-street, Mackay. There were few
local institutions of which he hadn’t been
president at some time or other, from the
School of Arts to the Turf Club.
At the wheel of her one-ton motor-truck
there regularly plies for hire as a carrier be-
tween St. George (Q.) and the railway at
Thallon, 52 miles away, Miss Biddy Brown,
sister-in-law of a popular St. George medico.
She makes the outward trip one day and the
return the next, the truck always loaded to
the full and on one of the worst roads in
Bananaland.
The late Dr. Ross, who represented Molong
in the N.S.W. Talking-shop for a quarter of a
century, had a supporter out in the Cheese-
inan’s Creek centre that swore by him. One
election day in Molong he informed the mul-
titude that he had consistently “plumped”
for the doctor for 20 years. “And what’s
more,” he declared, “Dr. Ross knows I’ve
always voted for him —I’ve always made a
point of putting my name on the corner of
my ballot-paper.”
How a taste for municipal politics persists
in the best-regulated families is shown in the
case of H. F. Richardson, the new unofficial
head of the Vic. Uppah Chambah. Richard-
son’s dad was president of the South Barwon
Council, and the son followed him. though
he started out as shire sec. Now the
son’s son is sturdily plodding a simi-
lar track as Mayor of one of the Geelong
municipalities. “H.F.,” by the way, lives in
the house built by Dr. Thomson, Geelong’s
first Mayor, who reigned in 1549.
Dr. HAY , Bishop of Tasmania.
“Machete” : There seems poetic justice in
the fact that two thieves who looted a Red-
fern (Sydney) pub were tracked down and
seized, with" all their bottles thick upon
them, by Sergeants Philpott ahd Ilennessy.
LINES TO A NEW ARRIVAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So here you are, at length,
In all-subduing strength,
Although your weight is hardly worth a mention ;
Long-promised, often sought,
Belatedly you’ve brought
Relief from horrors forced on our attention ;
Nor shall your praises be
Unsung (at least, by me,
Though other “potes” are dumb, my bardie betters):
A grateful rhyme is owed
To one Avhose charming code
Supplants a cruel mode and snaps a sex’s fetters.
Too long the race of men
Had thrust upon its ken
in direful, disenchanting emulation,
North of imprisoned feet
Unlovely lumps of meat
Tnat Nature never meant for publication ;
Innumerable calves,
To none but worser-halves
Enticing—shanks that bulged, and sagged and slanted;
Sights that no tumult bred
Or in the heart or head:
Romance abruptly fled and Mystery levanted.
But you arrive, and lo!
Smart maids and matrons show
No more than they in prudence should be showing.
The damsel, grown demure,
Regains the primal lure
Of Secrecy—the Age of Legs is going.
Too much, Avhen they reveal,
.)= Too little they, appeal—-
Concealment charms where revelation rankles:
These truths you reassert,
Round Arabella girt,
Now-fashionable skirt that reaches to the ankles!

year, and yet give efficient and economical service, White Trucks represent unparalleled value m
the motor-truck world to-day.
Though only comparatively new to Australasia, due to absence of representation, White Vehicles
have been manufactured for over twenty years in America, and their absolute leadership is
evidenced by the numbers of owners who have repeated their orders, till they possess fleets
numbering, in some cases, in excess of a thousand Whites.
These repeat orders are conclusive proof that White Trucks, though of a price in keeping with
their quality, make every return for the initial outlay by way of long, reliable and economica
service. There are no less than eleven distinct chassis types. To do themselves justice, prospective
truck and ’bus purchasers should call and inspect models held in stock by Australasian Distributors.

“Moinokeni” : At; the morning sick-parade
on the plantation 1. was trying- to diagnose ihe
various complaints with the aid of the “boss boy”
as interpreter, when one of the patients pointed to
his stomach and murmured something. I asked the
interpreter what was the. matter with him. “Oh,”
he said, “this boy he talk belly belong him he flg-ht
all the time.” A dose of oil fixed it.
“Huffin-Guffin” : Reverting to the old sub-
ject of - marsupial birth. J. D. Ferrier, of Cole-
raine (Vie.), a while back found a just-dead ’possum
where he had laid poison for rabbits. On turning-
her over he noticed “a tiny young- one, lonly about
the size of a French bean.” The little thing-, small
as it was, struggled through the fur towards the
pouch, and when he opened that maternal receptacle
the joey scrambled in and attached itself to one of
two teat,?. Ferrier has no doubt that the young one
was born after its mother had been poisoned.
* * * *
“Gumsucker”: Busli surgery? Old Chil-
lagoe (N.Q.) residents will remember an abo. known
as Pegleg Bob. He was thrown from his horse and
had his leg broken; and as the Walsh River was in
flood he could not cross it to get to the doctor, >o
lie and two other nigger’ waited a fortnight for the
stream to go down. But it, still kept up, and in
the meantime .the leg festered and was hacked off
above the knee by Bob’s cobbers. A hard-liitter hat
was filled with Stockholm tar and tied on the
stump till it healed. After that Bob always made
his wooden legs for himself from neighboring timbers.
* * * *
"Nitric”: Met a pilgrim from Bedourie
(W.Q.) the other day who had never seen a silver or
gold coin, being used to the paper currency issued
in the Never-Never. This takes the form of “shin-
plasters - small yellow papers the size of half-notes,
which vary in amounts (as lOU’s) from a shilling to
a fiver. The term “calabash” is sometimes applied
to them, and this particular wanderer was calabashed
up to the hilt. But he told a piteous tale of how
half his well-gotten gains had turned to powder in
his pockets and seemed amazed when I suggested a
reason. It was an old stunt in the West for pub-
keepers to, “bake” their own plasters before handing
them out, with the result that the bawbees when
crumpled in one’s pocket soon became powder.
Several "Queens” of Western townships thus made
I heir pile—thus plus well-doped liquor.
* * * #
“The Rumpus”: I lately came across a
trio of the rare harlequin-fish performing their fas-
cinating evolutions and water-jazzing around a basket
beacon in a calm ocean near Rottnest Island (W.A.).
They are beautiful with short bodies and deep,
broad sides marked with blotches resembling squares
of yellow, black and silver. Transparent fins ending
in short black trailers wave in perfect accord with
every twist and turn of these water-butterflies.
Nothing, apparently, seriously disconcerts them; a
stone dropped among them sent them in a flash
a few feet away, but another swift movement brought
them to the dancing place again.
"Ringer”: I would like the cattle-duffers
and poddy dodgers of the Council to give then-
views on the merits of twisted and plaited green-
hide ropes. I’ve made and used both, and after a
lot of experience reckon the three- or four-strand
twisted rope is far superior to the plaited one. I’ve
pulled up three-year-old cleahskins, and whenever a
rope gave way under the strain it was invariably
the plaited one. Incidentally, why is the hide
from a white beast better than that from all others?
“F.A.”: A little while
buck the Council discussed
Biughi and cannibalism, but
no definite instances could he
quoted of the dusky one’s lean-
ing towards man-meat. Since
then I have become possessed
of. a series of reminiscences
of an early settler out on the
Darling (N.S.W.), and he tells
an illuminative story of an
incident which occurred in
the middle ’forties not far
from Bourke called by Binghi
Wurtamurtah. A youthful
abo. gave information to a
settler regarding a cattle raid
mooted by his own' tribe, and
when lie was returning from
the homestead he was accosted
by two of . his fellow tribes-
men. One of these directed
the informer’s attention to-
wards the ground and the
other got busy with a wadety.
The body was then pierced by
spears and left transfixed for
several hours. That night, a
corroboree was field by the
tribe around a fire a quarter
of a mile from where the kill-
ing- took place. At the end
of the dancing period the
tribesmen marched off, at
intervals of 10 or 12 yards,
to where the punctured abo.
lay, and by means of spear
thrusts and sheer physical
force detached portions of the
traitor’s anatomy, which they
took back and threw upon the
fire. When the blaze died
away the cooked bits were
raked out and devoured “in
much the same manner as a dog tears its meat.”
It would appear, however, that it was less a matter
of gastronomy than of treating the erring one in that
spirit in which our own race in the bad old days
used to draw and quarter a man.
“Baro” : Even if, as “Blunder Buss” (B.
•>O/8/’23) says, I “must have been schooled by new-
ehums in the art of cooking johnnie-cakes and
damper,” I have had too much experience since to
require further instruction from another new-chum,
whose statement that his johnnie-cakes stick to him
is credible enough. If, instead of pounding fh e life
out of the coals and “drying” them, he watches and
turns his eakes frequently while cooking, they will
not burn nor turn into greenhide. Small goods

require to be done very quickly, otherwise they are
tough. A trifle of dripping put in the mixing will
counteract the effect of slow and clumsy cooking,
whilst, if cooked properly, the cakes will be as “short”
as “8.8.’5” acquaintance with the culinary art. As
for burying a damper in a hole to cook, anyone wno
could ill-treat it like that deserves to have the
S.P.C.A. sooled on to him. “B.B.” further airs his
ignorance by asserting that sand (which 1 used be-
cause I found it easier to manipulate with the shovel
most commonly found on the track—a piece of bark
or wood) would work its way through a thick cover-
ing of red-hot coals. Let: him employ my method
of making a hasty damper (which he clearly has
not. tried) ; then if he is troubled with grit let him
curry-comb his ziff before taking a second helping.
The assertion that “the class of timber used for
coals is important ’ is bunkum. 1 have always used
the timber of the locality in which I happened to
be—pine, nuilga, boree, gum, etc.—with equally
good results. To make the finest swaggies’ damper,
mix from one, to two oz. of dripping (butter is
better) with each pint of flour, place the dough under
a dish (a billy may be used) big enough to allow it
to , rise, then cover with ashes as usual. The result-
ing loaf is as good as can be turned out from the
best baker’s oven. By the way, here are a couple
of wrinkles for “Steve Hart” (B. 16/8/’23) to add
to his useful list. If he mixes his flour with very
hot water it will become a trifle spongy, and if he
happens out Kosciusko way let him mix it with
snow, and he will not require baking-powder.
“Bora”: Talking of sound sleepers, a crack
bullocky in the New England (N.S.W.) district, about
30 years ago, having got well oiled in town, became
sleepy on his way hack to camp, and turned in on
the side of the , road with his head on the edge of
a puddle. He woke up at dayljght to find himself
frozen to the ground by his hair-rand he had to wait
till the sun rose before he could get up.
“Two Seas”: The heavy gale last month
broke up the happy home of a pair of maggies who
had just started housekeeping on the top of a 50ft.
pine that Was blown across my garden fence. Mrs.
Mag appeared to be discouraged by the accidept and
left for another suburb; but the old man has built
another home on his lonesome. This time he chose
a branch on the leeside of a, pine only about 12 ft.
from the ground. He spends most of his time now
at his front door warbling invitations to unattached
spinsters to drop in and inspect his new flat “with
view mat.”
♦ * * *
“F.A.” : Talking of queer-auction Incidents.
At a North Coast (N.S.W.) horse sale a few years
back among the prads yarded was an aged black gelding.
In the absence of bids the battling auctioneer, to
show that the horse wa’s thoroughly broken in, got
down from his perch, grabbed the halter-rope, jumped
aboard and dug in his heels. Two seconds later be
hit, the ground very hard. The sale was completed
by his understudy, who knocked the prad down to
the local undertaker. The auctioneer passed out a
month later as the result of his injuries, and the
black gelding helped to take him to the cemetery.
“Sarah”: I was with “Nosredneh” (B.
16/8/’23) when he said that jackasses do not stand
in water like other birds when they have a bath.
Every morning, winter and summer, they have a
dip in our cattle trough and plunge in one end and
out the other. But this morning- I got a surprise
when I saw a couple in a puddle about 6in. deep.
They hopped in till the water fairly covered their backs;
then, ducking their heads under, they flapped their
wings in the water after the manner of ducks. After
much splashing they flew out and preened and
ruffled their feathers for a while, then flopped into
the water again and went through the same perform-
ance. Whether they drank I couldn’t say; I didn’t
go near enough to disturb them.
“Azac”: How did the Australian brumby
originate? If could hardly be indigenous, otherwise
the aborigines Would have sent a mounted division
to try to dissuade Captain Cook from landing. In
the Fieijd, Will Ogilvie claims as the progenitors
of the brumby a stallion and three mares which
Governor l’hillip imported in 1788 and which later
“went bush.” Perhaps some patriarchal Abo. re-
members something of the event?
“Barcoo” : Recently, while motoring to-
wards Betoota, down near the south-west corner of
Banana land and adjacent to the 8. Aus. border, we
happened upon the largest flock of wild tur-
keys any of us had ever seen. They Were all
huddled together in the shade of one -of the very
scarce trees of that region. It was possible to get
within counting distance in the ear, and they were

tallied at 52. They all appeared to be strangely
interested in whatever was happening- among them,
but as to what that was we could get no clue —
maybe it was a meeting of delegates from all the
surrounding districts to protest against the continued
dryness of the season. Anyhow, the sight was
unusual, as the plain turkeys do not, as a rule, con-
gregate on the ground, or even fly in a crowd.

NEW TEETH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I’m wearing a smile that’s hard to shift,
It’s a cheerless kind of grin
That twists the wrinkles and lines and seams
Where my cheeks have fallen in.
1 smile away if I’m dull or gay.
It’s there when I'm feeling sad :
I have to smile when 1 want to scow!
At the things that make me mad.
My jaws are rigid and propped apart
By mj artificial teeth;
My upper lip is an inch away
From the one that is underneath.
And it’s past a joke when I try to smoke
My pipe with a broken stem ;
It presses down and it pushes up
Till it puts a twist in them.
1 smile as a waxen figure does •
Dressed up in the shoddy slops
(Ready-to-wear, with an extra pair)
in the reach-me-down men’s shop's,
A smile we’ve seen in advertisemehts-r-.
Some fool with his face abeam —
Who’ll testified he was pleased he'd tried
Some wonderful shaving cream;
I think that I’ll let my whiskers grow"-™
They’ll hide it after a while.
1 do not care for a fringe of hair,
But I hate a mirthless smile.
.1 feel that my friends all want to laugh
As they nod and pass me by,
Or say good day in an awkward way
With a twinkle in the eye.
I smile as I read ere I go to rest
Till the smile becomes a yawn;
I feel it creep as I go to sleep
And it’s there when I wake at dawn.
But my face is straight as l take my plate
Of chicken or fish .or meat ;
And I drink my tea in toothless glee—
For I take them out, to eat.

Akubra Hats
Give Confidence
and Satisfaction.
TWO of the essentials in buying are to
know yourself confident and satisfied.
Australian-made Akubra Hats give con-
fidence, because of their several styles to suit all,
and because of their superior quality of make
and material. No better hats are manufactured
anywhere, and they are the product of Australian
money and enterprise, and of superior and highly-
paid Australian labor.
Insist upon Akubra Hats, which outwear all
competition.

“.Golub”: Have any medical members of
the Council ever tried treating snakebite with injec-
tions of potassium permanganate solution, instead
of rubbing the crystals into a wound made at the
site of the bite? I have never, heard of this being
done, but, all the same, it should be a distinct
advance on the old method. Pot. permang. has the
power of oxidising most organic compounds and
rendering them harmless by splitting them up into
simpler bodies, and it is especially effective in the
case of the alkaloids and the ptomaines to which the
ordinary snake venom is closely allied chemically.
This is more or less at the bottom of rubbing the
crystals into the place where the patient has been
bitten ; but when it is so applied the absorption of
the permanganate must necessarily be limited, and,
anyhow, by the time it is applied the venom in many
cases has already been distributed throughout the
whole system and is completely out of the reach of
such a local antidote.

“Imlay”: Twofold Bay (N.S.W.) claims
the world’s biggest whale —a finback killed there by
the Davidsons, the only bay whalers left in Aus-
tralia: It ran to 98ft., and the jawbones, which are
still preserved down there, are 27ft. 6in. long. It
was a cow whale, and they would never have got her
but that her calf was driven ashore by the killers,
and the mother, in trying to get it off, was stranded
herself. She must have weighed well over 100 tons.
“Two Seas”: I can support “Barcoo” (B.
27/9/’23) re queer growth in abnormally wet sea-
sons. Some ironbark-sapling stakes driven into the
ground for fruit-tree guards threw out foliage during
a wet spring on the Gwydir. But, out of respect
for the Abo. Council’s love of the truth, the whole
truth, I must admit that the growth died off as the
sap in the stakes dried up. “Barcoo’s” ready-made
trees may have fared better, as I am well aware that
at his address it isn’t safe for a man with a peg leg
to remain too long on the same spot in a growing
season.
* * * *
“O. Archibald”: The other clay I wit-
nessed the breaking-in of two thoroughbred yearling
colts. Judging by their capers before being ridden
they were both outlaws. With a heap of compassion
for the stable midget being legged
up I was prepared to see the
first, a wicked, aristocratic-look-
ing son of a reputed rogue —Red
Dennis —put up something novel
in a back-bending, rearing, tear-
ing exhibition; but to my aston-
ishment his conduct would have
shamed an old maid’s phaeton
pony. He apparently didn’t know
the ABC of pig-rooting, let alone
bucking, and his attitude was
one of unconditional surrender.
The handling of the second colt,
a fine, upstanding brown with a
faultless pedigree, was an iden-
tically tame affair. When I com-
mented on the youngsters’ good
manners the trainer said he’d
had hundreds through his hands,
and only a very small percentage
knew the first thing about buck-
ing—and, he added, the excep-
tions were not stickers on the
racecourse. How is it that the
thoroughbred, usually a courage-
ous fighter on the turf, will sub-
mit to a man-handling without
a struggle, while the horse of
common clay usually puts up a
fight, sometimes a hitter and
prolonged one? These two colts
had been in the stable only six
days after coming straight from
a station up north; so there is
no question of their being pets.
Leo Lear”; Re durability of Australian
hardwoods underground (B. 13/9/’23). I think it
greatly depends on the nature of the soil in which
the stick is placed. Lately I had a post-and-rail
fence removed that had been up 45 years. Every
post that had been in stiff black soil was sound, and
was uSed again for yards. Those which had been in
light soil and gravelly rises were only fit for the
fire. The timber was either stringy-bark or messmate.
“R.A.W.” : During a recent visit to Tas-
mania I dropped in at the V.D.L. CoCs sheep-farm
at Woolnorth, and, by the overseer’s l courtesy, was
allowed to peruse some entertaining passages from
an old official diary kept by my host’s predecessors.
One of the latter, in charge in the ’fifties, received
an instruction from headquarters that future reports
must record in detail the precise causes of
all sheep fatalities . about the place (then about
100,000 acres). Here are some of his choicest
post-mortem decisions: “Killed by brindle dog”;
“drownded in ditch” ; “decay of nature” ; “aged wether
went to sea”; “dropsy”; “in accouchement”; “short
of appurtenances for mastication”; “poverty”;
“senile decline” ; “water on the brain” ; “weight of
years”; “victim of a fighting ram”; “asthma”;
“slain by a falling stone” ; “killed at gate of bull
paddock, attempting a felonious entrance.”
* * * *
“Kobbi”: Which is the flimsiest bit of
architecture in bird-land—ground-builders barred?
For a bird of some bulk, the tawny frogmouth
gives a very poor exhibition of home-building—just
a few sticks, small ones at that, thrown at random
into the broad fork of a tree or on to a horizontal
INFAMOUS PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT.
“A bloke that ’ud, put a mangy pup in a billy with clean pups
ought to be reported to the Minister fer Health.”
limb. You’d think that if the old lady sneezed she’d
upset the whole caboose; and I’ve given up wonder-
ing how the deuce the two fledglings balance them-
selves in it. The nest of the dove, among smaller
birds, isn’t much better ; but then she manages mostly
to secure a spot where the limbs and twigs are of
great assistance, and particularly does she love a
pine-tree. The nest of the wood-swallow is another
hold-your-breath contraption, and ma mostly over-
crowds it with offspring; but I’ll plump hard for
the frogmouth as the worst builder of the lot.
“Lindesay” : About 40 miles west of Ada-
vale (Q.) there is a place known as Jack-in-the-
Rocks, alias J. D. Springs. A bush shanty stands
there, and it used to be an old mail change of Cobb
and Co. It got its name from an old groom who
died many years ago from eating rum. Whan it
came to burying him they found there wasn’t enough
wood to make a coffin, so, to fix him up nice and
comfortable like, they excavated a hole in the rocks.
But old Jack refused to fit into this —he was a foot
or so too long. As the weather was very hot and
the rock was very hard this was rather awkward, till
someone thought of the axe. The rest was easy —
they just lopped old Jack’s legs off below the knees
and he tucked in beautifully. And there he lies
to-day, with his tootsies handily beside him for use
when Gabriel’s horn summons him to parade.
“K.E.8.” : Did any Abo. ever try burning
his strychnine for poisoning dingoes? One old
baiter put me on to it. Place some strychnine cry-
stals on an old shovel and hold it over the coals.
(“Don’t, ’ang over the fumes, me b’y, or you’ll ’ave-
a nedaehe for the rest of the day.”) Whert it is
burned, crush to a fine powder, and apply as usual to
whatever happens to be the dog’s favorite tucker —
some like wallaby, some emu, some just plain mut-
ton. The old chap swears no antidote is of any
avail when once a dog has taken a dose of the
baked powder,
“Harry J.”: While I held the hurricane-
lamp my mate dashed in and clubbed to death the
old tiger-cat that had put a front paw in the bunny
trap. Placing Tom in a chaffbag, he swung him
acros.:i his shoulder and we set out for the camp.
About half-way Bill dropped the bag with a yelp,
and grabbed at a sore spot in the small of his back.
“That blanky cat!” he said viciously, and within
a minute he- was applying the skinning-knife rather
frenziedly but very thoroughly. When he emptied
tile cat out at the camp the jolt completely severed
the head from the body—a fact which gave my sore-
backed mate considerable satisfaction. Just about
midnight a sudden squall struck us, and sent the
camp tinware flying. “What’s that?” I yelled,
waking with a start. “That cat, I’ll bet,” replied
Bill, with drowsy resignation; “’e must ’ave found
’e’s blanky ’ead agen!”
* * * *
“Ivobbi”: The imported starling is push-
ing its way northward with a vengeance. In the
wheat country of the Darling Downs (Q.) it is now
the commonest bird on the landscape, and this
despite a bonus for its head and eggs. At Rockhamp-
ton (Q.), about 500 miles farther north, there wer.e
one or two pairs a couple of years ago, and they
were then something of a curiosity; but, when 1
was up there the other day, it looked as though all
their relatives and acquaintances had adopted the
place as a permanent address. It would be interest-
ing if northern Abo. Councillors advised us as to
the starlings’ present northern limit.
“Branch Tribesman”; We’re not out for
record loads or gentlemanly oxen conductors, but how
is this for a biggiih trip? “Shina” Myers, a local
lad, left Dunkeld (Vic.) at 10 o’clock one Monday
morning, with a team of 10 bullocks, for Glenisla,
near Horsham. He loaded 100 hives of bees there
and was back at Dunkeld at 4 o’clock Wednesday
afternoon—over 100 miles in less than three days. I
need hardly state that it was Springtime, and the
bulls were “sorter flash."
* * * *
“Nugget”; A few years ago a number of
cattle died mysteriously on the Upper Hunter
(N.S.W.). Samples of the grass upon which they
had been feeding were
analysed and yielded traces
of prussic acid. Later on
a similar case occurred
at Forbes. In each instance
the offending grass was
blue couch. The strange
part about the affair .is
that stock have been graz-
ing over the same areas
ever since, and no cases of
poisoning have been re-
ported. What generates rhe
acid in the plant? If
it is a natural process one
would expect to find it
occurring at a certain
period each year, or during
the fresh growth of the
plant following a change
from bad to good seasons.
On the other hand, if an
abnormal condition -of the
soil is responsible, other
varieties of couch in the
same paddock should be
similarly affected. Certain
other varieties of fodder
are injurious, notably
young sorghum, but their
poison-generating periods
are fairly regular and well
known. In this respect
blue couch is a law unto
itself, and the rarity of
authentic cases of poisoning makes it hard to get
a proper understanding of the master.
“McJ.”: Here are a few more good hints
to dingo-scalpers. Open a tin of sardines just
enough to let a dingo get his tongue in comfortably,
and place 'your bait on the opened part. Of course
you want to fasten the tin to a' stump or a tree,
otherwise it may be carried away. After eating
the bait the dingo will lick away at the tin until
the poison takes effect, and he should die near by.
After scalping a poisoned dingo, have a look at him
now and again to see whether his mates have been
at him. These pests eat their dead comrades, and
if he happens to be ,a poisoned comrade- it generally
means another bonus for the scalper. If your dingo
is too “ripe” to scalp when you find him, hang him
up in a handy tree for a month or so until he dries
up ; then he’ll be all right.
“Cpndamine” : A good deal has been said
about dampers, but has any Abo. ever tried baking
yeast bread in the ashes? When the wife and 1
set out to pioneer a pricklv-pear farm in Banana-
land 50 miles from the railway, our stove arrived so
very gradually that we hit on this method: We dug
a hole about Ift. deep and 3ft. in diameter and filled
it with box-wood, which we let burn down to good
coals. The wife punched the dough for the second
time and set it to rise on a sheet of brown paper
in a dish. When it, had risen the .batch was lifted
THE QUID PRO QUO.
“Dreamt I was workin' all last night."
“That’s no good to a man!”
“Oh, I don’t know — I’m goin’ ter charge up
overtime!”
with the paper on to the ashes in the hole; another
sheet of paper was placed over it, and the hole
was then filled with hot ashes. About two hours
later the batch was lifted out with the paper burned
off and the crust a beautiful brown. The rest is a
pleasant memory.
THEM WHITE-MAN LAWS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The village people make-im dance to-night—
They plenty feast, they hammer drum, they play,
They sing-im song, they make-im gammon fight,
They stamp-im foot, they smack-im chest, they
say :
“Ah, this the time for make-im hearts come glad,
For rainy season finish, and the sweet
Potato and the yam come ripe for eat!
Come plenty dance, and no more sit-down sad!”
At. ’nother time I plenty like the chance
To have-im some of them good-feller thing,
Like young-one yam and woman-pig, and dance
And help-im altogether people sing.
But now I feel-im that I no more can,
For heart belonga me he very sore;
To dance and feast and sing I want no more.
I just sit down along the beach —one-man.
I think about one girl I want to take
For wife. And then along myself I speak
That all white man who come this place and make-
im laws for all we natives got-im cheek
To say that we must always like them do,
And no more eat-im man, no hunt-im head.
But, oh, I wild like Hell because they said
That we must no more steal-im woman too!
That girl she is the best belong- this place.
A pretty ramie all the time she wear.
Her body straight, her skin it soft, her face
It plenty smooth, and all along her hair
She put-im croton flower. In all my life
Another girl like her I no been look.
Ah, very much I glad suppose I took
My club and steal and keep her for my wife 1
But Gumment man no like-im me do that.
My word, I think he put me longa gaol,
And keep-im me in dark place, like a rat.
And then —mightbe—that girl she make-im wail,
Put ashes long her face, rub hair with lime;
For though we no been speak, my eye been see
That when 1 look-im her she look-im me
Kind feller too-much plenty all the time.
So, as I can that girl no more go steal,
To-day along her father I been go
And tell him altogether how I feel.
“I like-im her,” I talk. “I come to know
If you want sell-im her?” Then I begin
And talk-im too much plenty for one hour
About her pretty ramie and the flower
Along her hair, about how soft her skin.
I make-im big mistake. That man he got-
Im cunning head. For long time he no talk,
But look-im me like I no savee what
(I fright he want hit me with tommy-hawk !).
Then when I stop, he open mouth and say
If girl belonga him so plenty nice,
Then must he ask-im one big-feller price!
And then he name them thing he want for pay.
INTELLIGENCE
“Ever studied the ’obits of dawgs? Some of ’em’ are
more sense than their masters.”
“Yus! I got one meself like that.”
“One case tobaefi,” he say, “one voung-man pig,
Two box fish-hook, four lines what plenty long,
One looking-glass, two packet match, one big
Grass mat. one bottle rum, one very strong
Sheath-knife, one leather belt, one white blank-et,
Ten fathom turkey-red, one armlet shell”—
My word, I think he never going to spell!—
“Three string of beads, and one mosquito-net.”
And then he stop and think and have-im smoke.
And then more thing alonga me he ask- —
A shirt, because the one belong him broke,
Some trader meat what come along a cask,
And tortoise-shell and shell belonga pearl,
And umberel’ and fan to keep him cool
Like white men do —Oh, I been proper fool
To talk about how plenty nice that girl!
It one big price all right! But, never mind,
Suppose I got them thing I pay-im quick,
Her face it smooth. She look-im me so kind.
She worth it all. Oh, I come all-same sick
Because I poor like mouse belonga church,
And all them plenty thing that girl to buy
I no more got. But, though I close-up cry,
I tell-im him that for them I goin’ search.
So, while the people dance, I sit along
The beach one-man, and tell myself I must
Go find-im job somewhere, work plenty strong
And no more spend-im nothing, only just
Go save-im up my wages for to get
Them things to buy that girl. And all because
Some damfool feller white men make-im laws,
And all them old-time native ways upset!
VICTORIA.

The Sydney season is moulting. A few
gaily-hued feathers in the way of big charity
dances and cabaret flutters are still in its
tail, but a week or two will find them on the
scrap-heap of memory. Society punters are
already boxing any of their plumage that
wasn’t torn to shreds by the Randwick
westerlies so that Flemington may have a
chance to pluck it to pieces.
Over £5OOO will be divided among Sydney
charities as a result of the Rose Day collec-
tion. Rarely has Martin-place looked more
attractive than it did last Friday. A Avis-
taria-hung bower swayed in the morning
wind beside a trellised neighbor where roses
clambered and ran riot; delicate pinks and
brave yelknvs caught the morning sunshine
—and organdie-frocked girls cleverly juggled
threepences into their collection-boxes,
Florrie Howard, who, as assistant organis-
ing secretary, put in months of hard work,
burbled over the prize awarded to her stall
by judge Diana Wilson. The second prize
went to No. 18 Stall. There Avas dancing
on specially-prepared platforms, and bands
were scattered all over the landscape; and
that clever Long Tack Sam brought his
jugglers from the Tivoli to give an open-air
performance.
Flaunting the colors of the rival Great
Public Schools, 12,000 people, mostly matron
and maid, shrieked the youths to victory at
the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.
’Twas a rainbow-hued gathering, wherein old
folk forgot their years and flappers vied in
rich dressing, and chattered and chocolated
to the limit of the gallant young man’s
pockets. And when the meeting ended with
a shout of “Shore,” who had won the cham-
pionship, the rush for the long queue of gaily-
decorated motor-cars left no doubt about how
the carnival had gripped the best families.
The day, however, almost ended tragically.
When the tall, curly-haired M. Lyne won
the mile sensationally, felkw-seholars of
“Shore” rushed pell-mell to carry him in.
But in the Ava.v was Lieut.-Gov. W. P. Cul-
len. who had taken the salute a little while
earlier, and he was brushed aside as straw
before the gale. A timely hand and near-b.v
seat saved him injury. The Lieut.-Gov.
smiled broadly—probably he was this sort of
exuberant boy himself once.
There is a lack of dignity in the manner
in which the Avomen’s tribute to Dame Mar-
garet is being handled. The cant about the
list of names accompanying the cheque should
be cut out. Even on the Avettest Sunday
afternoon in England one fails to see Dame
Margaret and the children cheering the
heavy hours Avith a study of “Lizzie Brown,
Redfern, Is.” ; “Mary Green, Balmain, Is.”
.... If the comfortably-off women of N. S.
Wales Avish to, add a bit to the £5OOO the
Government has passed to Dame Margaret’s
credit, well and good ; but there are obvious
objections to the plan of supplying business-
houses Avith lists for circulation among their
employees.
Premier Fuller’s wife, with daughter
Gwen and son George, returns to Sydney
by the Makura on November 28, after seeing
something of Uncle Sam’s Land.
Red roses and fashionable frocking filled
the long oak-panelled rooms of the Feminist
Club one day last week, when the club flowed
into tea and oratory to the glory of Lady
Forbes Robertson. The Feminists are par-
ticularly interested in her because of her
efforts to help women during the suffragette
movement, and it was from this base that
Miss Preston Stanley struck the triangle of
praise; Mrs. Liddell, an Irishwoman herself,
produced the fact amid cheers that the guest
of honor with the laughing eyes was half-
Irish ; and Ruby Rich, in gong-like tones
that issued from a beautifully embroidered
three-piece, muezzined the guest’s art. Then
Lady Forbes Robertson arose in her slim-
ness, and, tilting her head back a little be-
cause of her hat’s droopy brim, spoke in a
friendly, between-ourselves manner that
netted all hearts in the big crush. After
which everybody started to move about, and
some beautiful frocking got a chance. The
Waley dame, in exquisite black, with black
pearl ear-rings, was the belle of the after-
noon ; and Mrs. Willie Anderson, Mrs. Harry
See and Mrs. Dransfield were others in purple
and fine linen. Mrs. Dan Kelly was seated
among the Chosen, and the McGregor girleen,
who played lead in Clemence Dane’s “Bill of
Divorcement,” turned a cool magnolia cheek
to the beholder. Clever acting-girl Bea Mac-
donald had flung a quaint necklet of mother-
o’-pearl around her throat, and this dangled
cooingly against black georgette frocking.
May Beatty, in a black cape that disguised
her as completely as a domino, came late;
so did singer Julia Caroli and violinist
Stahl’s wife.
It seemed as though nearly half the popu-
lation of Sydney was in the air when the
Girls’ Realm Fgte opened with a bang on
the top of Hampton Court. The big roof was
alive with people, and the lady with the
basket who came along half an hour after
the kick-off found the stalls picked bare.
The tulip-bed, with its hidden treasure, was
perhaps the greatest example of closer settle-
ment, though the tea-house ran it a near
second. Nearly £2OO is the net result of the
market on the tiles.
Ethel Turner’s (Mrs. Curlewis’s) first
little Australian, .Jean, is to be married in
the last days of this month. Jean employs
a money-making pen of her own, and has
written several books, besides running a
weekly kiddies’ column in the Telegraph.
The lad in the case is Dr. Leonard Charlton.
Another engagement of interest to Sydney
is that of Nell Tully, of Brisbane, to H.
Mort, of Franklyn Vale. Her mother was
the pretty daughter of the Harry Leviens.
The Maple Brown-Faithfull knot-tying
during the week at Goulburn stirred that ex-
clusive country town to its foundations. The
bride, Florence, is the second bud of the
squatting Lucian Faithfulls. one of the first
families to inhabit the land, and the bride-
groom was If win Maple Brown, whose
father’s lot is Gundary Plains. Oodles of
money on both sides, so the names of the
guests occupying the front pews sounded
like the jangle of a cash-register. Florence
wore a Rue de la Paix creation of gold
brocade moire swathed in classic folds, and
a Limerick-lace veil lent by Dame Knox.
Bride’s sister Valerie was chief bridesmaid,
in mauve softness, and Audrey Maple Brown
and Margaret Knox chose the same delicate
coloring. Gwyn Faithfull and Clarice An-
derson had.decided in favor of pink. A tiny
page, like a satin book-marker, solemnly car-
ried an ivory cushion that looked like a mon-
ster cream-puff. After Bishop Radford had
secured the double harness, the township’s
motor-power was requisitioned to purr the
guests to the Agricultural Hall, whose Arctic
bleakness was successfully disguised as a
Persian garden, wherein real rose-bushes 1
bloomed. Both mothers, presented de luxe
grey frocking and black millinery to the mul-
titude.
Vivid-looking IJaidee Carson slipped into
matrimony with Dr. Norman Gregg, of Bur-
wood, the other evening at St. Stephen’s.
The bride, who swept up the aisle on father’s
arm, was in soft drapings of ivory tones,
and hoisted a meringue-like head-dress of
tulle veiling and old lace. Jean MacPherson
and Doris Hardy bridesmaided in a shimmer
of silver tissue through pale pink and blue
georgette; while Jock Carson and Douglas ;
Read supported the bridegroom. Bride’s
mother and father, the Duncan Carsons (he’s
of Winch-combe, Carson), dispensed the sub- i
sequent wedding cheer at the Royal Sydney >
Golf Club.
There is no city in Australia where this ]
steady-eyed lady is not known. If you have i
forgotten her, she’s still Miss Agnes Murphy, i
owner, many think, of the greatest publicity ]
brain in this
continent.
Agnes started
her career as
a journalist on
M elbourne
Punch and
Table Talk,
but it was as
secretary to
Melba that her
special talent
came into its
own. It was
she who did
the “publicity”
for Amy
Castles’s first
season in :
London; Ada
Crossley and
the tragedian
Mollison were
others for
whom she ex-
erted her hypnotic powers with editors and
the good old public. One of her biggest jobs
was managing the Quinlan opera season
in Australia. She was the expert at the
back of the Sistine Choir triumph last year;
and at the present time her stored-up know-
ledge of things theatrical in four continents
is being used in the service of Lady Forbes-
Robertson.
Geraldine Browne, of Rose Bay, whis-
pered her “I will” to William Bentley, of
Edgecliff, one evening last week at St.
Mark’s, Darling Point. Bridegroom’s sister
Eleanor attended Geraldine, and her own
sister Kathleen warbled a solo from the
choir loft when the last rivet had been driven
home.
Passed away on October 2, at Henty, Miss
Clara Clinch, daughter of R. J. Clinch, of
Summer Hill, and grand-daughter of the late
Captain John Clinch, of Hobart. Miss Clinch,
who devoted most of her life to the Egypt
General Mission, was in Germany when war
was declared, and escaped with only the
clothes she was wearing. Resuming duty
in Egypt, she was attached to the Military
Hospital at Alexandria, and later worked at
Zeitoun, Ismailia and elsewhere. Pneumonia
caused the Mission to return her to N. S.
Wales for 12 months, but after another short
stay in Egypt the old trouble recurred, and
the medical authorities ordered another two
years’ rest. Many Diggers of all ranks will
remember with grateful feelings the little
lady who did innumerable things for their
comfort, always quietly and always tactfully.
She is buried at Wagga.
This, is Gilbert Mant, whose very first
book, “Holy Terror,” a collection of short
stories and verse, will be punlished this
month. The young man, who is known to
The Bulletin
for his articles
and “ Jacky
Ro o ” para-
graphs, claims
Hugh McCrae
as a cousin,
thereby adding
yet another
nanu to the
long list of
McCrae
writers a u d
artists. H i s
dad was the
late “Billy”
Mau t, Pro-
secuting Offi-
cer :n N. S.
Wales for
many years,
who also wrote
verse in his
spare mo-
ment-L With
the proceeds of a potato venture at Coo.na
in 1921-22 young Gilbert galloped off to
London for " a year, and stormed Fleet-
street with some success; and it was from
there The Bulletin first heard of him—-a
set of nostalgic verses he wrote was greedily
put by for the 1923 Christmas number. Next
March he will go off to the U.S.A. to widen
his vision and, of course, seek fortune an
enterprising and withal modest young man.
Romney was responsible for the likeness.
Letters from London tell of the death,
while holiday-making in the south of France,
of Mrs. Westby, the wife of that Ashley
Westby who formerly owned Pullitop station
in the Wagga district. Though for some
time she had been living in England many
friends in Sydney and Melbourne will feel a
sense of loss at her passing.
David Jones lured the wives of the Coun-
try Press and a group of city newspaper
women to the wilds of Marlborough-street
last week, and showed them the firm’s tall
factory, where everything from laundry
work to printing is done. On the floors be-
tween, tailor-mades (for both sexes), woollen
goods, bathing-suits and beach-cloaks that
would have made Joseph’s coat appear a
pallid ghost come into being, designed by
the Poiret of the Factory, and cut out in
multiple by one who runs the electric shears
through the layers of cloth as smoothly as
Delilah ran her snips through the locks of
Samson. The factory has its dispensary
and tiny infirmary, too; and, indeed, until
the world goes back to the golden age when
each man dug his own plot of land, and
each woman spun her own flax, this build-
ing, with its cool and well-lighted rooms, is
every way a model of the factories that
must be.
Lindley Evans is back in the studio at
Paling’s after his tour through England and
Scotland as Melba’s .accompanist. You may
remember that the prima donna heard him
by chance, and there and then engaged him
to go to England and play for her. He re-
ports that the Dame’s season was a trium-
phal progress; hundreds of would-be hearers
were turned away from every concert, and in
every London audience was a bunch of royal-
ties. The modest Sydney young man did
some study with Tobias Matthay ; this chance
he got through brother-pianist Frank Hut-
chens- —Matthay is so rushed that always
when Lindley was having a lesson there
would be a dozen or more boys and girls
seated in the room; musicians these whom
Matthay hadn’t time to coach, but Avho were
allowed to come and listen while he super-
vised the studies of the luckier. Before com-
ing back Lindley played to many S’African
audiences ; and he gives his first Sydney reci-
tal since his return next Wednesday evening
at the Conservatorium.
A Cabaret Tea to help with the expenses
of last week’s ball for the Hospice for the
Dying will be the stirring event at the Went-
worth next Tuesday. Walter Kirby (if he
is in Sydney) will unleash the glory of his
tenor voice in a set of old English airs,
operatic numbers and modern songs; and
there will be jazz—a completely new pro-
gramme.
Australia’s old friend Marie Narelle is
again disclosing the beauty of her soprano
notes to U.S.A. audiences, which grow lyric
over her singing in oratorio. She and the
velvety contralto Nevada Van der Veer have
been billed together in Verdi’s Requiem, and
the duet, which is the gem of the composition,
drew a quarter-column of eulogy from
N’York’s best-equipped critics.
Dorothy Helmrich continues to do well in
England. The Mosman songster’s last letter
brought news of a triumph at Douglas (Isle
of Man), where Dorothy and Peter Dawson
were the only vocalists. A-top of this
Dorothy was engaged by the English branch
of the International Society of Contemporary
Music to sing the mezzo music in the “Bliss”
Rhapsody at Saltzburg, in Austria. The
Saltzburg festival was once an annual affair
—originally promoted to enable music-lovers
to hear the latest of the world’s music.
Dorothy will be a week there; return-
ing she will have a 10 days’ rest at Munich,
where, with Florence Austral, she will take
in as much as she can of the big opera
season.
More motorists have been attracted this
year by the golden glory of the wattle in
Galston Gorge than by the wistaria at
Wentworth House. The Gorge at all times
is of surpassing beauty, and there’s a
new teahouse in the village to supply
refreshment to the weary. It is placed in
a bower of orange flowers, wattle and leafy
orchard. And in case the native of whom you
ask the right turning isn’t a poet, and doesn’t
at once recognise the description, the pretty
little place is next to the public school. The
owner is Mrs. Tom Scott, and her husband
was one of the founders and the first secre-
tary of the Automobile Club.
The Westmead Home, which had its
annual reunion last Sunday, has looked
down over Parramatta Park for 30 years.
Two hundred boys regard the Home as their
own, and the Marist Brothers encourage
them in the idea. There are some wonder-
ful .workshops, besides well-kept pig-pens and
fruit-trees, and a printing-room, in which
has just been installed a fine press, electri-
cally driven. But it’s still the pigs that are
the pride of Westmead.
Gwen Nelson, who has never been out of an
engagement since she left Sydney as a speci-
alty dancer for the Fox films, returns to Syd-
ney in five weeks time. She has been study-
ing all the while she has been across the
Pacific; her masters have included Zan Freta,
who was for years ballet-master at the Met-
ropolitan Opera House, and Ned Wayburn,
of the Ziegfeld Follies.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. gave two garden parties on the 9th and
10th, and among those who strolled amid the Gov-
ernor’s flower-beds were the Cowleys, the Lennons,
Mrs. Ted Theodore, the Morgan and Philp ladies, the
Oadell Garricks, Macgregors, Cumbrae Stewarts, Mrs.
Willie Collins (in a very charming filmy frock with
white satin shoes and a cavalier hat), the Bob C'ow-
lishaws, Mrs. M. Forrest, the A. D. Walshes, the
Trotter and Brodie dames, Marjorie Byram, Jean
Gross, Nell Tully and Grace Deshon (who is stay-
ing with his Ex.). Margaret Prior wore a cream
silk crochet frock at the party, and received felicita-
tions over her engagement to Michael Rogers before
she left with the private sec. and his ecclesiastical
relative for a stay at Torilia station.
His Ex. said nice things to the Daily Mail for
its encouragement of beauty-gardens when he pre-
sented that paper’s cottage-garden prizes, in the
Albert Hall, under the friendly bough of the Horti-
cultural Society. Clayfield got the first prize, through
Cameron Evans; and Chelmber got the second, be-
cause of the garden of one McVinish.
The Governor, taking Margaret Prior and Michael
Rogers along, went to the Southport Show; then
returned to Brisbane to speak before the Highbrows
of the Women’s Club. Grace Deshon, of Mitchell
Downs, and Capt. Hammond went with him to the
latter affair. President Highfteld gave the welcom-
ing hand, the Brydon dame and Martha Burns (who
drove a motor-ambulance during the Big War)
thanked Sir Matt, and Mrs. Gilbert Wilson, Mrs.
Mankey, Florence Micheli, golden-haired Eunice
Cochrane and Jean Barlow made music.
A picture palace was the scene of the farewell to
Father O’Flynn, of St. Patrick’s, in the Valley, who
has since gone on to Gympie. Father English handed
him a £3OO cheque and nobody quoted Bret Harte;
but the Hibernian band played. St. James’s boys
had a gold watch for Father McSweeney, who goes
up the north coast with Father O’Flynn.
Mrs. Cadell Garrick and her girls are off to China
and America by the Tango Maru. Pitcairn Jones
is being transferred to the China naval station, and
his wife (who was Marjorie Cameron, of Southport)
is coming on here for a holiday before joining up.
Minister for Agriculture Gillies arose from an in-
fluenza bed to see the last of his mother, who died
at Tweed Heads the other day. She was 84, and
came to N.S.W. from her native Scotland when she
was 17. Of eight children —six sons and two
daughters—seven survive.
Brisbane is now chatting with Sydney on the
’phone, and Sir Matt ,and Deputy-Governor Cullen
had a few remarks a day or two ago.
Blanche Jensen, in shell pink, contraltoed in the
Albert Hall on the 11th, and gathered in some
fragrant vegetables, as did the Gillies and Bell
girleens, over whom a musical house enthused.
The wife of manager McDougall, of the Bank of
N. S. Wales in Brisbane, died after a short illness
last week, leaving five small children. She was
Muriel, one of the Donald Oormack girls, of Mos-
man (Sydney).

The G.-G. Forsters have broadcasted invi-
tations for a Cup Week ball at Government
House on Oaks night (Nov. 8).
The returning Stradbroke pair have sent
word ahead that thy will shed their radi-
ance on Henley-on-Yarra on Oct. 27 —a day
or two after they land. The Henley girl
is deliriously fixing up her new sleeveless tub
frock between shivers, and calling upon- Pro-
vidence for a sudden rise in temperature.
The: day was very warm last year, and she
hopes that history will repeat itself. George
Fairbairn will moor the presidential flag-
ship at the usual anchorage. Snow
Brothers have bagged a place for their craft;
but so far none of the clubs have booked a
spot, and even the loyal Scots have not put
a houseboat on order.
Mrs. James Dyer roped in all the musical
notabilities for her evening party on Thurs-
day, when the two visiting Englishmen, Per-
cival Driver and Dr. Whittaker, enraptured
the company with a recital that was probably
the finest ever staged in a Melbourne draw-
ing-room. Driver provided the vocal side
with a baritone of artistic quality, and
the doctor, a big man with a little mous-
tache and no musical suggestion about his
appearance, supplied a musical backing to
such purpose that the assemblage found it
hard not to stand up and cheer. Dorothy
Murdoch was heard to declare she had to
grit her teeth to keep from singing to it.
Mrs. Dyer, radiant in golden draperies, pro-
vided programmes de luxe. The cover pic-
ture, designed by Thea Proctor, illustrated
a line from one Whittaker composition:
“Sweep thy faint strings, Musician, with
thy long, lean hand.” And Thea, as you
might imagine, saw to it that the longness,
and leanness were duly emphasised. In the
crowd were the Fritz Hart pair, the Albert
Miller widow (just (back from an American
trip), the W. W. Cabenas, Prof. Ewart’s
musical wife, medicoes Rudall and Riddell-
Stanley, with their wives, Beatrice Ternan,
Mrs. Thirkell and “Yarrawonga” Mcßeath,
who landed back from the Fog last week
with the news that our musical pair, Cahill
and Brooke, are a “regular riot” at the Lon-
don Palace, and have a £l5O-a-\veek Colos-
seum contract already signed.
The scream of the week is that Priminister
Bruce’s travelling circus, already numbering
about 5793 people, is to be still further
strengthened by his typiste, Miss Cadwaladr-
Thomas, daughter of the Anglican cleric of
the name. The little army had hardly landed
in the Cold Land before Bruce cabled to
Miss Thomas to pack up her machine and
make for London with it “at the toot.” And
now lying rumor says that a very large
washer-lady and a very small “Buttons” are
casting hopeful eyes on the cable office.
Clive Leonard, who takes over the presi-
dency of the Vic. Amateur Turf Club, cele-
brated with a dinner at the Bohemian Club,
when Lieut-Gov. Irvine was the star guest.
The new president is following in the turfy
footsteps of his father, William Leonard,
who has loomed large in the racing limelight
for years, both as V.R.C. steward and race-
horse-owner. Clive, who is the second of
three sons, married a N. S. Wales girl,
Dorothy Reynolds, and their two sturdy little
sons and baby daughter are the apples of
grandpa Leonard’s eyes.
The committee of the Gentlewomen’s Aid
Society, with Mrs. TremearUe as president
and Ethel Flower as hon. sec., does untold
good, but is rather given to doing it by
stealth. It lias yet to realise the necessity
for publicity. The Edward Miller dame put
her finger on this when she unveiled the
half-yearly sale last week, at the St. Ivilda
Town Hall, and suggested the press as a
medium for attracting attention to the good
work. She might also have mentioned that
a small hall in town ought to be better than
any suburban hall in the matter of catching
the crowd. The rain rather damped the
financial success of the sale, at which much
buyable stuff was on offer, but the generous
can still help by giving orders to Miss Flower
at 25 Wattle Tree-road, Malvern. Now the
committee has taken to visiting some of those
for whom the society was brought into exist-
ence. Many of them lead pathetically lonely
lives. One poor thing confided to the secre-
tary that she had thought of cheering her
dulness by getting in touch with another
lonely soul through the advertising columns
of a paper, but in the end found she was
too shy to try the idea. Out of 112 mem-
bers a large number are either invalids or
tied to invalids. Incidentally, it was notice-
able on Thursday that not one motor stood
outside the portico while the sale was on.
Hitherto no vice-regal light has been shed on
the poor gentlewomen, a fact which might
be brought home to the appropriate quarters.
The Pioneer Plays in Melbourne have
brought out a new dramatist in Vance
Palmer, the Queenslander, who has seen life
in many phases, and is now broadcasting
“copy” from semi-suburban Emerald. He
knows the outback country of his own State,
and has travelled far abroad. Some years
ago he did a three-months’ trip from the
west of Finland to Vladivostock, living on
hope and strange experiences. While in
London he wrote for most of the reviews,
from the New Age to the Nineteenth Cen-
tury; and he is one of the 25 who have had
stories accepted for the next Christmas
Bulletin.
Bucketsful of rain failed to damp the en-
thusiasm of the Children’s Hospital Auxiliary
workers, who covered nearly every available
inch of the Outpatients’ Hall for their first
annual gathering; but a light weight in social
tonnage suggested that the Rolls Royces
were storm-bound in their garages. The
hospital president, Mrs. Lauchie Mackinnon,
being absent, owing to the death of her
mother-in-law, the John Turnbull widow
(an ex-holder of the title) was in
the chair. Mrs. Guthrie, who presides
over the Auxiliary’s workers, joyously
pointed to numerous new branches, and
further gladdened her hearers by reeling off
an astounding list of little garments result-
ing from the effort. These include (to men-
tion only one line) nearly 2000 nighties.
Now a call will be made for workers to help
run a canteen in the building, where tired
parents may take a snack during the weary
hours of waiting. An increase in size of the
convalescent camp at Brighton is also under
consideration. When all this had been said,
and a little more, white-capped attendants
handed out tea and cake.
Dr. Billy Johnston, only hope of the late
Judge, lands back this months from an Eng-
lish trip, and he and his cousin Jessie Clark
will seal a boy-and-girl romance with mar-
riage. The bride-elect, who is the daughter
of Col. Walter Clark, one-time Commandant
of Tasmania, is a good-looker with grey
tresses which belie her years. Dr. Billy
wore khaki right through the war, and came
back with an M.C. ribbon on his medical
major’s tunic. His mother, who died when
her son was still in the nursery, was a sister
of the late Donald Wallace, owner of Car-
bine.
Here you have Mrs. Henry Rosenthal, as
snapped by Rembrandt’s camera. This hand-
some matron
recently netted
a big cheque
for her pet in-
stitution. t h e
Queen Victoria
Hospital, with
a crowded at-
home in her
Toorak c h a-
teau, H o m e-
d e a n, which
her husband
lately acquired
from the Nor-
ton G r i m-
wades. During
the war and
after Mrs. Ro-
senthal inter-
ested herself in
p h i lanthropic
and patriotic
endeavor, a 1-
though she
lias kept aloof from committeeing because
her little family has had first claim on her
time and attention. Now, however, that
the youngsters are all out of the nursery
stage, she is becoming more closely identified
with various good causes, the welfare of the
Queen Vic. being her main suit. The matron
was a Beech worth girl, daughter of Hugh
Walton, of mining fame.
The Assembly Hall was filled on Saturday
night, for a piano recital by Jean Christie,
the 13-year-old from a Fern-tree Gully farm,
whose pianistic genius grew and flourished
without fertilisation, until, less than a year-
back, a student in the vicinity gave her
some tips, after which Irene Fletcher (for-
merly a well-known Melbourne pianiste) took
her in hand for five months. The child cheer-
fully cleaned out the local State school every
week to pay for her lessons. No one on
Saturday night could crook the finger of
doubt at Jean’s talent, after hearing th(‘
amazing youngster go through a long and
varied classical programme, given entirely
from memory, without one blunder. Her
interpretation is remarkable, and although
the lack of technique was evident at times,
more especially in Chopin’s hackneyed “D
minor Valse,” still the firm, sensitive fingers
scampered over the notes with rhythmic
accuracy. She has the right temperament
and caressing touch, with a helpfully
strong left hand. The promoters of the
recital hope the results will float a new piano
for little Jean.
St. Mary’s (R.C.) Church at West Mel-
bourne almost rivals St. Mark’s at Venice in
the matter of pigeons, but is nut in the least
proud or glad of it. Dean Carey, P.P.,
spends much of liis spare time with a pea-
rifle pointed skywards taking flying shots.
And he is no mean marksman either, con-
sidering that he is well up towards the
seventies.
Fate played a scurvy trick on Charlotte
Hemming and the Japanese Relief Fund on
Friday by sending the recitress the wettest
night of the wet season for her benefit re-
cital, the profits from which, she had an-
nounced, would be diverted from her own
purse into the fund. Yet the place was
well filled, and those who had cheerfully sub-
mitted to be soaked for the cause got their
reward with an all-star menu. The hall was
tricked out with flowers and colored lights,
to supply the necessary atmosphere for the
big squad of helpers in kimonos and floral
ear-pads, who roved the building with bal-
loons, baskets of flowers, sweets and other
articles wherewith to raise the wind. The
band was headed by thp youthful daughter of
our Japanese ’Varsity professor, attractively
robed in her national kim. The large-
hearted Charlotte was called on again and
again for elocutionary numbers, and was
almost drowned in vegetation and applause
after her excellent Shakspearean selections.
Various items of music were provided by
Mrs. Roy Ashton, Isobel Biddle, Jo Foster,
Violet Parkinson. Mostyn Wright, Arthur
Coppin, Louis Ilattenbach, E. V. Philips
and William Burrell, who nobly risked his
precariously invalided thumb to help out the
accompaniments. Mrs. May Quinnel deserves
three cheers for the fine results of her hon.
sec. efforts, and James Martin (treasurer and
general factotum) worked like a beaver.
Dead at Newtown (Tas.). Mrs. S. F.
Jamieson, daughter of Dr. G. F. Huston and
a native of Hamilton, in the Speck. Asa
girl she went to Norfolk Island with her
father, who was civil surgeon there until the
convicts were removed in 1854. Mrs. Jamie-
son was present on the island during the
Lady Franklin mutiny, the troops concerned
being a detachment of the 99tli Regiment.
She returned to Tas. with her father, and
married in 1861. One of her daughters is
an Inky Wayfarer on the mainland.
Heiress Verna Johnson faced a running
fire of congratulations when she hopped back
from her Sydney jaunt last week committed
to a matrimonial date with Gordon Brady,
brother-in-law of Ernest Watt. The bride-
elect and her mother are helping to fill the
Cup season frivolity list with a big ball; but
as the invitation cards were ordered before
the Sydney visit, it cannot be set down as a
celebration event. Verna is the grand-
daughter of the gilt-edged widow Johnson
(afterwards Mrs. Nicholas) who squatted
for a time in Toorak House, once the guber-
natorial residence and now the home of the
Argus S powerses. That was in the early
’eighties. At one Clip meeting the widow
held up the eye traffic with a frock inlet
with gold—or was it gems?—of such costly
quality that, so the yarn went, she had to be
safeguarded by a detective. There is an-
other Johnson grand-daughter (her mother
was a Geelong Gwynne), 'who is likewise a
dollar princess.
The Charles Lloyd widow and her in-
separable pal, Millie Carter, who have been
in the Fog for several years, have suddenly
plumped for a return to their native sun-
shine ; and, unless they change their minds
after they get back to' Melbourne, they will
banish their steamer kit to the attic for the
term of their natural lives.
Mrs. M. R. Guerin, of Hawthorn, focusses
a little Australian history. Her great-great-
grandfather, Richard Tuekwell, was a
quartermaster-sergeant of the 100th. and
landed in Sydney in 1788. His ship also
brought the first Governor (Phillip) and
the first cargo of convicts. Her great-grand-
father, who was born in Sydney in 1803,
helped to lay out the village of Parramatta,
and was the builder of the first Australian-
made carriage—it was presented to Phillip
aforesaid. Grandpa continued the all-Aus-
tralian descent by coming to light in Sydney
in 1824, and her dad chose Melbourne for
his first appearance 21 years later. His
name, by the way, was Moses Stoneham, and
he was a noted cornet-player in his day.
Also he had 24 brothers and sisters, and his
wife came of . a family of 17. Mrs. Guerin
is a native of Parramatta, and her own
children arrived in either Sydney or Mel-
bourne.
The hand of sympathy goes out to General
Charlie Ryan, who received a cable last week
telling him that his wife had died with tragic
suddenness at Coblenz, where she was stay-
ing with her son Col. Rupert Ryan, who is
with the British Army of Occupation on the
Rhine. As the only Ilyan daughter is like-
wise across seas, the stricken medico is
lonely indeed. The deceased lady was a
daughter of Mrs. Sumner, of Stony Park,
widow of one of the partners in the now dis-
banded firm of Grice, Sumner. Mrs. Sumner
passed her 94th milestone just recently. The
elder Sumner daughter married the late
Richard Grice’s eldest son James. For some
years the Ryans have been sheltering in a
flat at Mayfair, South Yarra.
Ada Guildford, who will be remembered as
a gay adventuress in Bilanderson drama,
sends a coo-ee from San Francisco, where
she is happily settled with a husband by the
name of Bishop. She has no intention of
returning to the stage. Incidentally, what
has become of her handsome sistfer, E. Guild-
ford Quinn, whom one’s memory treasures as
a striking ingenue in the Australian produc-
tion of “The Morals of Marcus”?
This is Melbourne’s Mayoress-to-be, Mrs.
W. Brunton, one of the most philanthropic
matrons in
the civic set
Her work on
numerous Com-
mittees has
given her a
fine under-
standing of
public affairs.
For years she
has taken an
active interest
u the Cafltou
Refuge and
the North
Carlton
Creche, and.
further, she
presides over
the Red Cross
workings in
that district.
Another of her
activities is
the L a d i e s’
ILIC J J (l U 1 C o
Aid Association, which provides comforts for
patients and nurses at the Homoeopathic
Hospital; and she is now helping- to estab-
lish a canteen at the Melbourne Hospital.
Mrs. Brunton has a pleasing personality
which is sure to popularise her in her new
role. The photo is by Rembrandt.
Melbourne’s Anglican Archbisli. and Mrs.
Harrington Lees have broadcasted invita-
tions for an afternoon gathering on the
Bishopcourt lawns to-day (Thursday) ; but a
year’s acquaintance with opr capricious
climate has caused them to add a cautious
“weather permitting” to the “request the
pleasure.”
A line or two from Adelaide:—
Though the weather was fine for the S.A.J.O.
Derby there was a dash of winter in the dressing, and
coats and skirts were about at evens with new
Spring finery. The feminine vice-regais plumped for
marocain—her Federal Ex. in grey and Lady Bridges
in vivid stripes topped with a snug black hat. Miss
Judge sported golden brown. A last-year’s deb.
was smart and charming in cinnamon crepe-de-chine,
and of the older frockers a Melbourne matron’s black-
and-white georgette took a power of beating. On
the Wednesday the weather was so moist and bliz-
zardy that most women stayed at home.
From the races on Derby day the Forster and
Bridges ladies hurried to Unley Park, where
the Kidman house and garden had been requisitioned
for a Girl Guide fete. There was a gathering of
Guides and Boy Scouts at Government House on
Sunday afternoon, too, when Lord Forster had a word
to say and patted the Guides on the back for the
50 per cent, progress they have made in the last
12 months. So well are affairs moving in the city
and suburbs that the country is now to have a
little attention, and Miss Judge, and Mrs. Medley
have just gone northwards to establish branches at
Booleroo and thereabouts.
There has been a run of fetes—at St. Peter’s, to
clear off the £2OOO owing on the Anglican church
and rectory (the Barwell dame opened this one) ; at
Kensington Gardens, for its church, with Mrs. Harold
Hughes as sponsor, and at the Girls’ Presbyterian
College, Glen Osmond. There has also been a
bridge party to raise funds for the Mission to Sea-
men: Mrs. J. S. Proctor and Mrs. A V. Benson
were jointly responsible for it.
Dr. Marie Brown is going to have another shot
for the North Adelaide City Council. She is backed
by the Women’s Non-Party Assoc., and cites her
diploma of public health and her work for the
School for Mothers, Kindergarten Union, etc., as her
qualifications for the job.
L’Alliance Francaise has had its last soiree of the
season before closing down for the summer. There
was a biggish muster of members, and the honors of
the programme went to Mrs. Hugh Corbin for her
delightful singing of half-a-dozen French songs.
John Bishop’s friends have no intention of ior-
getting- him while he is in London,' and the Orpheus
Society combined with some of our best-known
singers to tender him another benefit the other night.
Hilda Gill, Sylvia Whittington and William Silver
(for years the boy’s teacher and his most enthusiastic
supporter) were the star performers.
Pewsey Vale, the property of the Gilberts since
’39, has changed hands. The original Gilbert was
one Joseph, who took up 4000 acres of Barossa land
with his future brother-in-law, Dr. W. J. Browne,
and since then Pewsey Vale has been one of the
most hospitable, of our station homes- —-a roomy, ram-
bling house set in delightful grounds with a deer-
park between the homestead and the sweeping pad-
docks dotted with giant red-gums; The joint pur-
chasers are A. J. and P. A. Mcßride, who already
hold an acre or two in the Lower and Middle North.
From England comes, news that Clara Serena and
her husband are back in London after holidaying on
the south coast. She is booked for concerts in Lon-
don and the provinces for the next five or six months.

SURE CATCH TACKLE
The postponement of Caulfield Guineas Day
was an embarrassment to owners still undecided about
scratching a horse for the Cup, or leaving it in
for final acceptance on the Monday. The original
date of the meeting provided hesitators with a clear
day’s interval between the gee’s test gallop and the
necessity for acting thereon. By postponing the
start of the V.A.T.C. meeting until Monday, and
putting back the final acceptance until Tuesday, the
club was bound to worry certain owners who were
waiting to see how the “form” jumped. However,
the postponement couldn’t have worried Whittier’s
owner. This horse had been established as favorite
on his merits. The mediocrity of the three-year-olds had
been demonstrated in Sydney. A surprise in the
Toorak Handicap could hardly threaten real danger
to the improved son of Woorak. He won the Caul-
field Cup last year, and has revealed himself lately
as a brilliant w.f.a. performer. Luck may beat
Whittier, or a suddenly-acquired cough, or even
something better at the weights, but the honest fellow
is a reasonable bet for the man who must have a
wager on the Caulfield Cup.
Whittier’s Caulfield Stakes gallop was by no means
a bad trial for Saturday’s big handicap. He cer-
tainly didn’t justify the price demanded by Dyna-
miteodds (6 to 4 on), but his second to Maid of
the Mist (7’s) was a good, honest performance. On
her day the All Black mare is liable to beat
anything in Australia over the Stakes distance
(nine furlongs) at the w.f.a. scale of weights, and
she was in a favorable position throughout, whereas
the favorite was rather poorly served at the start.
He had to be ridden hard to get into a good position,
and when his rider called on him again to tackle
the flying leader in the straight he was unable to
get on terms. However, he finished unfalteringly, a
length behind the mare, who is not in the Caulfield,
and lengths ahead of Easingwold, The Cypher, Back-
wood and Wynette, and he should beat that lot again
on Saturday, although the South Australian lady will
have 301 b. off her back. One of the disappointments
was David, who showed no dash at all.
Ridden in front for seven furlongs, King Carnival
cut up badly in the Craven Plate at Randwick.
Ridden behind for half-a-mile he won the Caulfield
Guineas, pulling up, in lmin. 40|sec., a record for
the race—time which showed that the track, water-
logged on Saturday, had dried thoroughly in .48
hours. The King was a 7 to 2 favorite, and the
second favorite, Rahiri, finished nearest to him, the
10-to-l shot, Frances Tressady, being a close
third. All Sunshine and The Monk, both well-
backed, were never in the hunt. King Carnival
looked brighter than at Randwick, and little Sim-
mons handled him surprisingly well. He has, of
course, come into favor again for the Y.R.C. Derby.
Holt’s stable produced the winner of the Toorak
Handicap in the Land of Song mare, Sonora. Backed
from 12’s to 4’s in a field of 21, she got away nicely,
was well-placed at the turn, and had too much toe
for Beeline and Melola over the last bit. Next to
the placed horses was The Tyrant, who had bad luck
in running, and who looks like being Whittier’s most
dangerous opponent in the Caulfield.
Other features of the first day were Versine’s
conquest of Heroic, a 6-to-4-on favorite, in the
Debutant Stakes, and Accarak’s victory in the 1010
Welter, a race won by Night watch and other horses
destined to become celebrities. Accarak is a five-
year-old brother to Whittier (Ben Chaffey owns them
both), and has been supported for the Melbourne
Cup, in which he has 6st. 71b.
“0.K.” : Backwood, the English-bred horse
in Bradfield’s stable, who ran an impressive fifth in
the Caulfield Stakes, has been perplexing the punter.
His English performances as a three-year-old fully
qualified the son of Bachelor’s Double for the Bst.
131 b. he was asked to carry, as a five-year-old, by
the handicapper for each Cup. To be sure, he ran
unplaced in the English Leger, and in four other
races during- the season, but in eight events over
courses ranging from 11 to miles Backwood was
placed first, second, or third, one of his wins being
the Ascot Derby. No English horse was ever des-
patched to Australia with better credentials as a
stayer. Apparently the Clark-Baillieu firm, successor
to Clark and Robinson, came early to the conclu-
sion that if Backwood could win anything this
season it would be the Melbourne Cup. Nevertheless,
somebody’s money helped make him an early favorite
for the Caulfield Cup, and the racing world was
always inclined to remember that King Offa and
Lucknow, imported horses from the same stable,
scored brilliant wins in the Caulfield Cup ere they
went for the Melbourne Cup and failed, that failure
being the end of their racing career in both cases.
Besides, there must have been a nm-him-if-he's-
’-eady idea at the back of the Clark-Baillieu mind,
otherwise Backwood would have been scratched for
the Caulfield Cup long ago. And how could Back-
wood be a possible good thing for the Melbourne
Cup two miles if he were not forward enough to
have a great chance for the Caulfield Cup 17 days
earlier? The necessity of writing before Caulfield
Cup acceptances close makes Backwood a difficult
subject to discuss. But his English form, rein-
forced by his fast, finish in the Caulfield Stakes,
suggests that he will trouble the best of the Aus-
tralian horses over a distance.

“Fax”: A recent reference to Trenton
recalls a genuine racing-dream story concerning the
Melbourne Cup of 1886. Trenton had run third to
bheet Anchor and Grace Darling i n 1885, when he
was unlucky to lose. Next year, with 201 b. more
to carry, the handsome ge 0 looked quite a good
thing if he would stand a proper preparation A
Maori land farmer dreamed
three nights in succession
that the son of Musket
had won the Cup. He fol-
lowed the horse to Mel-
bourne and got the
trainer’s permission to
hang around the stable
where his hopes were cen-
tered. We all knew the
story at the time, and
were acquainted by sight
with the elderly man who l ,
in a way of speaking,
“would never leave Tren-
ton.” We understood that
the old chap had realised
on his little bit of farm-
ing property, and was risk-
ing all his money—some
£3O0 —on Trenton at 10
to 1. Meanwhile the nag
had gone dotty in one of
his forelegs, and the wind-
ing-up of his preparation
was interfered with. Still,
the dream fanatic went on
believing. He was posi-
tively puffed up with pride
when Trenton, looking
somewhat too handsome
for the job, came out for
his preliminary. Despite
his superfluous flesh the
big horse fought out rhe
finish with Arsenal, who
had exactly two stone the
better of the weights, and
it was condition alone that
enabled the 20-to-l chance
to win by a long neck. Tren-
ton reeked with sweat. It
had been a wonderful effort
to bring off the dream.
“0.K.”: The passing of Shillinglee, one
of the early fancies for Melbourne Cup, was foretold
by the work-watchers. On paper, assuming him to
be capable of standing a preparation, Shillinglee
looked better handicapped even than Heir Apparent,
who beat him for places in the Sydney Cup. The
proposition in the case of the English horse was
logical. The Sydney Cup run was far and away his
best to date ; therefore he might be expected, being
slowly acclimatising, to go on improving more than
the Victorian horse. But, like so many other im-
portations, Shillinglee has gone wrong, whereas
Heir Apparent is standing a steady preparation. As
long as his party continue to fancy him as they do
now, the Heir must be counted very dangerous. But,
as previously remarked on this page, he is by no
means a bobby-dazzler. He will not be capable of
beating another King Ingoda on last year’s terms.

The mating of imported Sea Prince and
Paper Money provided the turf with three very use-
ful animals, Purser, Sea Risk and Note. All three
ran at the A.J.C. Spring meeting, and although the
geldings did nothing remarkable the mare won a
£lOOO race for W. Kelso, who owns and trains her.
On Saturday she repeated the performance in the
10-furlongs City Tattersall’s Handicap, flashing past
the judge with' a neck to spare from Master Cagou,
who was the same distance in front of the sluggishly-
ridden Brown Rajah. The winner was at s’s and
the others at 6’s; in fact, it was 5 to 1 each of
two, 6to 1 each of four. Yet no doubt McShortodds
told the horse-scribes who publish his wails and
imaginings that he “lorst on the race.” Note and
Brown Rajah have been sent to Melbourne, where
both should pay expenses, the English horse especi-
ally, as he looks capable of more improvement than
the mare. The latter is only a little thing and has
hitherto fared badly in big fields.
* * * *
“Merrigal”: Mumblebone, winner of both
steeplechases at the A.J.C. meeting, is named after
the station where he was bred—Kater Brothers’ run
in the Warren district (N.S.W.). Having raced him
locally without success, the Raters sold him for
£2O to Russell Brown, another Warren pastoralist,
who passed him on to his brother Bert, a director of
the Great Western Stores, Dubbo. In Bert Brown’s
colors the nag ran in two grass-eaters’ handicaps
at the Macquarie Picnic races, held at Dubbo in
May, but failed to get into the money. Twenty
pounds on the tote was the stable commission each
day at Randwick, but the stake-money was worrh
while.
“Quarter-sheet”: A symposium of my in-
veteiate pony-punting 1 friends who escorted their
wives to Randwick on Eight Hour Dav
yielded quaint results. The question was
Why don’t you take the missus out to
the pomes sometimes?” The answers ranged
from: “What do you take me for?” to “You must
“ink I haven’t much respect for the ole cheese!”
One was, Here! What do you take the wife for, any-
how?” I apologised, and he seemed to think the
apology was necessary.

S-A Derby was thought a good thing for
R. E. H. Hope s King of Mirth (Comedy King—Little
Joan) and he started at 2 to 1 on in a field of 10 •
but Hopwood had to ride hard to get him home
from the Cyklon colt Stormy Day, by a head. The
race was very rough, and the most-talked-of visitor,
Kupert Clarke s Spook, had a bad passage. The
MorphettvHle Plate for two-year-clds was won easilv
“y A - Tennant’s Ble Noir (Buckwheat—Goldeii
Malt) from Mrs. Richard Hawker’s Cyklon filly Mon-
tella. progeny are showing promise.
• Adelaide blunt Club Cup, an event founded
in Adam Lindsay Gordon’s time, was a farcical affair
this year. Cullulerane, a horse with a good record
over the jumps, was top weight, but broke his neck
His owner, Andrew Tennant, rode him, but had
another horse engaged, Wargamurra, which made all
the early running but then was done. At the last
tence of the four-mile journey (on the MorphettvHle
course) Wargamurra was quite 200 yards behind the
three leaders. However, they all ran off, and he
plodded along to win by about that distance from
Sir Pistol, a. hot favorite, ridden by Alan McFarlane,
j" n • Dividend £l4 6s. in a field of seven,
McFarlane made no mistake in the Bracelet Handi-
cap, which he won for the fifth year in succession.
He is admittedly the best amateur in S A., but has
had odd luck in the Hunt Cup: the. last three times
he has looked a certainty up to the final fence, but
failed to get home. Alan McFarlane, sen., won it
about 20 years back.
* * * *
“Ashmead”: W. D. Win spear’s Royal, who
won the high jump at Launceston (Tas.) Show,
must be the oldest lepper in the game. He dates
back to the Boer War, having been foaled in 1901.
BIBLE STORIES (REVISED VERSION).
“Now Moses saw the people wor shipping the Golden Horse, and
cried: These be thy odds, oh, Australia!’ ”
Linesman”: A little over 10 years ago a
Victorian tennis-player, in Maoriland to see Austral-
asia play the U.S.A. for the Davis Cup, mentioned
to the American champion, Maurice McLoughlin,
that he was training a kid in Victoria, who, in his
opinion, would one day represent the Commonwealth
in the great event. “What’s his name?” said Mc-
Loughlin, and the other answered, “Jack Hawkes.”
“Never heard of him,” declared the Yankee, “but
I’ll bet you 10 dollars that a protege of mine, Roland
Roberts, of California, will get into a Davis Cup
team before your boy.” “Right,” agreed the Aus-
tralian—and sailed home. Roberts promised to beat
Hawkes in the rush for international rank, for, m
1919, he soundly walloped the redoubtable W. M.
Johnston. Yet he faded away, and Hawkes won the
bet for his tutor and old admirer, though the Jap
earthquake prevented the latter collecting the cash.
It was Russell Keays, who was killed with Hawkes’s
father when the earth rocked under Yokohama.
Jim Willard was the hero, and Miss Lance
the heroine, of the Metropolitan tennis tournament
at Strathfield (N.S.W.). Willard beat A. L. North
(8-6, 6-4) in tha singles, and, with his brother
Aubrey, settled K. O. Anderson and R. Cummings
(6-1, 2-6, 6-3) in the doubles. He would be a
Davis Cup possibility with an improved backhand.
Miss Lance won everything she nominated for: —the
singles, the doubles (with Miss St. George) and the
mixed doubles (with Frank Peach). She is playing
in such fine form that her meeting with Miss Boyd,
in the match against Victoria next month, should
be worth travelling a long way to see.
Clem Hill and .Toe Travers, of the old
school, and Vic. Richardson, of the present, have
been chosen by S.A. to select the inter-State cricket
teams for the season. The former custom was to
entrust the work to delegates from all the clubs.
S.A. has received a cordial invitation from Queens-
land to play there in January after the Sydney match,
but has replied that the eastern, trip takes three
weeks as things are and that the players cannot travel
further afield. This is a pity; in view of the
trouble over the Sheffield Shield the Wheat State
ought to welcome a meeting with the Queenslanders
if the thing can possibly be arranged. How about a.
three-days match in Sydney immediately after the
return game between N.S.W. and S.A. ?
..--***
It. Bardsley, a brother of Warren 8., the
international, is drawing attention to himself by
his feats with the bat. In the opening round lie
scored 130 n.o. for Western Suburbs and followed
it with 114 n.o. against Waverley, last year’s pre-
miers. He bats right-hand and is more aggressive
tnan his brother. D. Mtillarkey, a St. George left-
hander, is also in the limelight; his two innings
have yielded an average of 254. In the grade com-
petition Gordon (7 pts.) lead from Waverley, Mos-
man and Marrickvilie (6 pts. each), but the season
is young yet.
“Treble”: The Vic. Cricket Association
was moved to make the residential qualification a
year, instead of three months (B. 11/10/’23), by a
report that Keating, of Collingwood, was to get
£lOO for two years’ service with Richmond. This
poaching destroyed an unwritten agreement that no
club would entice away another’s players, and made
a tightening up inevitable.
“Tren”: Touching queer occurrences in
cricket. Playing at Lords for M. 0.0. against the West
Indians, C. H. Titchmarsh was bowled by a fast
one from John. The off and leg stumps were
knocked out of the ground, but the middle
one was untouched. The theory is that the bails
were tightly jammed between the two outside sticks
and that when the ball hit the off-stump the same
force was communicated to the leg one.
The “find” of Sydney public-schools sports
was C. V. Walker (C. E. Grammar), a tall, weil-set-
up youth with rare pace. He collected a treble —
the 220yds., in 23 l-ssec. ; the 440, in 54 3-ssec. ; and
the 120yds. hurdles in 17sec —and was fifth in die
broad jump. There are possibilities in the youngster,
but he was asked to do too much in one day. So
was E. L. MacDonald (Sydney Grammar), who, after
winning a strenuous half-mile in 2min. 6sec., was
allowed to contest the mile. The overtasked youth
led most of the way, but was beaten in a rattling
finish by M. T. Lyne (C. E. Grammer) in 4mm.
47 4-ssec. It is a foolish and risky business, this
overworking of willing young colts. A. N. Finlay (Syd-
ney Grammar) annexed the 100yds. in 10 3-ssec., and
A. Cunningham established a broad-jump record of
21ft. llin. —the previous best was “Slip” Carr’s 21ft.
4lin., registered just before Carr left for the Pales-
tine campaign in 1917. The senior premiership went
to C. E. Grammar (65 points), from Sydney Grammar
(52) and King’s, last year’s winners (27) ; and
King’s (394) took the junior title from High School
(36) and Newington (184).
Fighting at five days’ notice, George Men-
ses was outpointed at Sydney Stadium by Tommy
Swift, a rising bantam from Melbourne. The little
1 ortuguese from Pyrmont bogged in from the start,
intent on scoring a quick win, but the Victorian
was elusiveness itself, and Mendies failed to land
an effective punch. In the sixth round, Swift shot
over a short right, and Mendies dropped to the
canvas, but he was back on his feet, fighting like
a wasp, before the count began. The Victorian
boxed skilfully on the retreat and piled up the
points. He well deserved the decision that went
his way, and Mendies well deserves another match.
: These eulogistic references to
Weber s prowess on the mat make me feel sad.
The last time I saw him, he was locked in the
arms of a Yankee, and the two heaved and squirmed
for two hours without a fall. It was a dreary
spectacle, but I saw it out to the bitter end. Then
I staggered to the nearest hotel and perked myself
up with a few. I needed them; I felt as if I’d
been to a burial service. If championship wrestling
again becomes the vogue in Australia, the pubs
should be allowed to retail restoratives till 11.
“F.A.”: Re footballers and Bluff (M.L.)
oysters (B. 11/10/’23). The best individual effort
1 ever saw was that of Freddie Roberts, the Welling-
ton and All Black half, who despatched 17 dozen
in one sitting, and about four dozen were fried.
There is an annual football match at the Bluff
between Pakehas and Maoris. It was after this fix-
ture in 1911 that Rangi Thomas, a Maori from Half
Moon Bay, Stewart Island, immortalised his name by
stowing away 29 dozen before tea. In my time
Wally Newman, himself a footballer, kept the bivalve
joint to which all visiting' teams resorted, and when
new figures were made Wally would solemnly write
them on the wall above the record-breaker’s seat. I
recall the challenging pride with which he would
point out the reference to Rangi’s dazzling achieve-
ment.

“Centurion”: Dr. Warren’s motion for the
re-admission to the Rugby Union of repentant League
footballers was considered at a special meeting in
Sydney last week. When it emerged from the scrum
its parent could hardly have recognised it, for it had
been changed from an amnesty to a fresh declaration
of war. The chief points of the motion as carried
are that only League players who have never received
money—an infinitesimal percentage—are to be con-
sidered, and then they must apply before December
31, 1923. After that the gates of the Union Para-
dise will be banged until January 1, 1927, and the
League Peris can weep outside and he d—-d.
Overlander Francis Birtles, who has
dashed into the interior to get some exclusive moving
pictures for the Empire Exhibition, has been feeding
his ear with a new Australian motor benzol pro-
duced from coke by the B. H. Ptv. The oil develops
less carbon than the ordinary petrol, and Birtles’s
appreciation is expressed in a sheaf of telegrams
testifying to the economy of the new fuel under
abnormal conditions in Western Queensland and
N. S. Wales. He says in one wire that he did 500
miles on 15 gallons against strong westerly gales,
and when pushing on through patches of heavy sand
and soil the record was 380 mips for 13 gallons.
Several competitors in the recent reliability trial
from Brisbane to Sydney are also using B.H.P.
benzol, which bids fair to materially lessen the de-
pendence of this country on a particularly greedy
type of foreigner.

A great performance was that of Earle
Oroysdill and Vic. Allerton in driving their small
Overland from Perth to Sydney, via Adelaide and
Melbourne, in 8 days 7 hours 21min. Great because
the conditions were all against them —sandstorms on
the Westralian route and tracks ranging from sodden
to flooded this side of the Bight. They were half-
dead when they reached Sydney, but the record is
theirs.
HIS DILEMMA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the day when Gumtree Creek were playing
Pigweed Flat,
They wanted three to win when Scroggs, their last,
came in to bat;
But Smithers at the other end was laying on the
wood,
If Scroggs could play the over out the Gumtrees’
chance was good.
No Trumper or Macartney he. His gait was some-
what queer
As forth he came, the joint result of nervousness
and beer.
'Twas obvious, to brace himself to face the dire
ordeal,
That Scroggs’s elbow had been crooked with in-
judicious zeal.
Ufcon his shoulder fell the captain’s hand, but not
in blame,
No adjuration reached his ears to try and play the
game.
The skipper had no time in such heroics to decant,
The admonition that he gave was far more relevant.
He knew his man and doubted if he’d ever get a
run;
“Just block,” he counselled, “and suppose you see
more balls than one,
Assuming that for instance three come hurtling
through the air,
Get down upon the middle one ; the others won’t be
there.”
■Scroggs intimated with a nod he’d got the warning
right,
Then zig-zagged in and took his guird and trained
his wobbly sight
Upon th’ opposing bowler’s arm. Followed a groan
of woe,
This way and that the wickets flew and Gumtree’s
cake was dough.
Yet when they blamed him for defeat and chid him
for disgrace
’Twas with a certain bitterness I heard him put his
case. «
“My eye upon the centre ball I kept,” he said, “I’ll
swear,
I took the skipper’s solemn word the others wouldn’t
be there.
But he never put me wise to this —and how was I
to tell ?
That I oughter gone and played it with the middle
bat as well.”

J. S. Rogers, who has been allotted the
£6OO-a-year job of lecturer on natural philo-
sophy at Melbourne ’Varsity, is one of that
institution’s own products—he took his M.A.
and M.Sc. there before going to Cambridge.
The Speck was his birth-place.
“Brother”: Last Sunday one of Sydney
Domain’s best-known spruikers, after con-
cluding a long harangue to a crowd of many
hundreds, invited questions. No one had any
to put. “Well, if you all agree with me,”
said the orator, showing his teeth, “why isn’t
the collection more than three bob?”
“Ole Blue”: How’s this for the middle-
man’s profit. Mick Fogarty, a Bungaree
celebrity, bought a ten-guinea suit in Balla-
rat, and by the time the receipt came home
it had cost £44. Tlyree separate times
Mick went in to pay for the apparel, and
in the end the missus had to finalise the
transaction. The middleman kept the pub
at Warrenheip.
“The Deacon” : Mention of an Australian
being first classical master of St. Stanislaus’
College at Bathurst 50 years ago recalls that
two blown-in-the-glass Australians are
at the head of it now —John Hall, the
president, and his brother Mark. Both have
qualified in sport as well as learning—Jack
played with the Western Districts against
metropolitan teams in the days of those
Rugby Union features a score of years ago.
Balmain natives, they began their studies
at Bathurst, but were “polished off” abroad.
“Ses”: What hits me hardest in every
Eight Hour procession is the folly of huge
encumbering banners that require a trolly
and horse team to carry them, foul the wires
overhead, and get torn to ribbons in the
wind. In the -latest Sydney procession sev-
eral of these banners, costing £BO or more
each, were completely destroyed. An expen-
sive luxury for one outing a year! A small
banner, that two men could carry on foot,
would answer the purpose, and result in a
big saving of funds for more useful pur-
poses.
“Sierra”: All sorts of fantastic theories
have been put forward to account for the
missing Baron Blantyre, ex-War Duck. The
Japanese earthquake, fire, explosion, pro-
peller-blade piercing the stern, icebergs—any
theory, in fact, except the simple one that
she met bad weather, crumpled up and sank.
The War Duck was one of those standard-
ised stop-gaps hastily thrown together in
1918 when vessels had to be rushed off the
stocks in the shortest time consistent with
the most perfunctory riveting. Five years
is a fair life for such a vessel, and most of
her ricketty sisters could also be put out of
existence by placing them, heavy-laden, on
the Cape-Australia run in the month of
August.
“Libris”: Isn’t it time Sydney had a
decent public library? The present reading-
room looks more like the Mechanics’ Insti-
tute at Woop Woop than the cultural centre
of the richest city of the Commonwealth.
Externally, the library building is squat and
unimpressive; inside, it is dark, depress-
ing and congested. The library staff is
obliging and attentive, but the utter lack
of accommodation for readers is distressing.
Each time the writer has looked in lately
every seat has been occupied, and many stu-
dents have been standing up. The Sydney
library claims to have more books than any
other public library in Australia ; but what’s
the use of having the books if there isn’t
half the space for readers to consult them
in comfort?
“Bill Bowyang”: Rudolf Wahlen, the
German who built a “castle” on Hermit
Island, as mentioned by “Kip” (B. 13/9/’23),
has had a romantic career. Twenty years
back he was a clerk in the employ of Ilern-
sheim and Co. at Kabaul. The firm’s inter-
ests in certain islands in the Bismarck
Archipelago had proved utterly unremunera-
tive, but Wahlen believed that he could
hustle up some trade, and purchased this
part of Hernsheim’s business for about
£lOO. His first year’s turnover from the
pearling beds alone resulted in a clear pro-
fit of £4OOO, and the natives began to rush
him with their copra. A few years later he
was the wealthiest man in those parts. Just
before the outbreak of the w r ar he purchased
a large estate in Germany, and was residing
there with his wife and family when the
Huns decided to start something.
From a gentleman with a duster: —
During the rushed debate on the Estimates in the
Reps. Frank Anstey made a valiant appeal on behalf
of the House staff, some of whom, after years of ser-
vice, are trying to keep themselves and families on
£lB2 a year. Promotions are very slow among
these men, and the lifts are sometimes Gilbertian.
One man, elevated from the cleaning staff to a uni-
formed job involving longer hours and more respon-
sibility, had £2 p.a. added to his screw. During the
session he works from 9 a.m. until whatever time
the House rises, occasionally getting an evening off,
whereas when he handled the broom and bucket he
started at 8 a.m., finishing up at 4.30 or 5, and for
any evening duties he was called upon to perform
he collected overtime. Ministers can relieve one an-
other ; the Speaker and Chairman have their deputies,
and members can doss : but the messengers get little
relief. Things might be different if the staff had a
Wages Board to appeal to.
“Karee” ushers in a 15-year-old veteran:
The Aussie Flying Station at Point Cook recently
acquired as a mechanic a French-Australian kid of
15 with a somewhat stirring history. In October,
1914, the Royal Choom Artillery picked up the
orphaned Henri Hesmeme, whose mother was killed
during a beaucoup bombarde on the Armentieres
side of Lille, and whose poilu dad died later on
the field of honor. Henri remained with the R.F.A..
for two years, when he went to hospital with a
shrapnel souvenir. He rejoined his battery in time
for a stunt which left only his small self and two
others as survivors. He thereupon transferred to
the Royal Air Force, and “deserted” from one to
another squadron thereof until he found himself
at Cologne, behind the skedaddling Fritz forces.
On Christmas Day, 1918, attracted by the aroma of
a dinner, he decided to transfer his allegiance to
the Australian Flying Corps. He was duly signed
on, christened “Digger,” and given the age of 11
from that date. When the Squadron was ordered
back to Aussie, in February, 1919, • “Digger” was
twice shanghaied in a kitbag on board transports
by Mr. T. W. Tovell, who had constituted himself
the kid’s guardian. On returning to Cooroy (Q.),
Mr. Tovell found that his little son had died during
his absence at the Front, so he adopted Henri, who
has now followed his protector’s footsteps by join-
ing the Australian Flying Corps in earnest.

Wars and humors of wars were apparent
at Melbourne Playhouse on Saturday, when
Allan Wilkie, as Henry V., led a few reck-
less supers against a French king, whose
man-power had visibly wilted owing to the
requirements of the other side. However,
the audience’s imagination filled up the
holes,, and if the actual spectacle of facing
“the breach” was wanting in bloodthirsti-
ness, Wilkie’s indomitable voice and waving
sword created a passable illusion of battle.
The somewhat matured actor is inclined to
make old Harry of the hero, but he is re-
freshingly free from the prettiuess of Waller
and the pomp of Rignold. Mrs. Wilkie
(Katharine) twirls her elocution, so to
speak, in the piquant English lesson with
the handmaid Alice, and she employs another
perfect gown to make a Herkomer picture
of the incident. Corporal Nym, by Lewis
Townsend, wants to be left alone with a
good beefsteak, and Beresford Fowler’s Bar-
dolph runs a bad second to Augustus Neville’s
Pistol, whose florid humor is never out of
keeping with the part. Lorna Forbes is a
handsome Chorus, who utters her lines im-
pressively. The others are easily forgotten.

At Melbourne Majesty’s the Royal Comics
are doing their last dash for the season in a
one-week revival of “The Merry Widow.”
The combination of Howett-Worster (an
ever-improving Danilo) with the voice and
personality of Gladys Moncrieff as the
Widow, atones in a measure for the heavy
lack of romantic distinction in Cecil Brad-
ley’s Natalie, and the striking want of sub-
stance in Clarice Hardwick’s Frou Frou.
Gladys Moncrieff is not a miracle of airy
grace as the lady who lures Danilo from old
Clo Clo and the rest, yet the part suits her,
and Worster —well, how long is it since Aus-
tralia had a tall, slim young actor, with a
cultured baritone voice of fine quality, who
could hold a candle to Worster as an artist?
He plays Captain Macheath in “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” on Saturday.

“Pretty Peggy,” at Melbourne Princess’s,

narrative of a fine fruity newsvendor who

and thwarted the machinations of the owner

of Firefly. A well-dressed revue, stitched
together with a thread of turf interest, and
trimmed with reckless suggestions of race-
course, is a topical Melbourne entertainment
just now. Times are in its favor, its foot
is on its native heath, and its name is Rye-
buck. Lorna and Toots Pounds, and Aus-
tin, the honest Cockney, and their human
surroundings are getting used to their change
of domicile, whilst the advt. stresses the
point that women in search of latest modes
in frocks and things can find them at Hugh
Ward’s nippy show.
At Melbourne King’s there are but two
more opportunities for Father Boucicault to
impress upon Delpliine, aged 17, the priceless
value of innocence in girlhood, as beautifully
delicate as the bloom on the wing of a moth
and as impossible of replacement. Having
said which, the white-haired priest puts his
hand accidentally on the head of Delphine’s
boy, who has been hiding behind the garden-
seat with a view to eloping with the guile-
less damsel’s innocence as soon as possible.
This is not the only thing worth remembering-
in “Mis’ Nell o’ New Orleans,” but it is
one of the few. On Saturday the Vanbrugh-
Boucicault co. will play “Belinda,” preceded
by a Barrie playlet, said “Belinda” being
the Milne comedy that has been more than
once staged by local Repertory players.
“Tons of Money” is threatened for an
early date at Melbourne Palace. The names
of the co. engaged to present the masses of
boodle include Dorothy Brunton, Charles
Heslop, Sylvia Shaw and some others of the
late “Bulldog. Drummond” crowd. The pro-
duction is still in the rehearsal stage.

Walter Kirby’s mellifluous tenor will be
heard in matinee song recitals at Melbourne
Town Hall on the 25th. 27th and 30th ; and
October 31 is earmarked for a farewell con-
cert to Evelyn Scotney in association with
the University Con. Symphony Orchestra.
Clara Kimball Young, who is maintaining
her youth with great success, is the moving
phantom of “The Hands of Nara,” at Hoyt’s,
Melbourne, this week. Bebe Daniels is en-
gaged to give physical point and interest to
the extravagant yarn filmed in “The Glimpses
of the Moon,” while Hoyt’s programme at
the Gaiety depicts Frank Mayo as an hour-
old bridegroom divided from his bride by a
locked boudoir-door. At the Majestic, “Her
Accidental Husband” illustrates the movie
aphorism, “Marry in hate and love at leis-
ure.” The same house harbors “The Third
Alarm,” in which a large edifice is burnt to
make a fireman’s holiday. “Shams of
Society” is warning Britannia supporters
about the risks of abandoning home life for
a cabaret existence; and the Melba has the
speed-king Tom Mix whirling from Arizona
to Hong Kong in “Stepping Fast.”
The name of Wirtlis’ Olympia in Mel-
bourne has been repainted in readiness for
Caulfield Cup night, and the circus is already
so near that the roar of the lions can be
smelt when the wind blows that way. A dis-
tinguished human feature of the incoming
circus company will be a young man of
alleged royal birth and abnormal length who
is said to ride like a wizard and possess all
the beauty of Apollo. He will be on view
next Saturday.

At Sydney Opera House “The O’Brien
Girl” is still earning the pleased glance
and the approving hand. Mamie Watson is
the chief enchantress, but June and Dorothy
Roberts are moving pictures, while May
Beatty and Mark Daly are a blithe pair in
the quip-and-jest department. The dancing
is meritorious all through.
At Sydney Cri. “Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife”
is still converting her jerky, metallic owner
into a ravished soul-mate by the bold ex-
periment of stringing on a shickered French
Count to divest himself of sections of his
apparel in her bedroom. Meanwhile Ger-
trude Elliott’s raiment, plain and bifurcated,
is chic enough for the daughter of a hundred
earls instead of a single busted French mar-
quis.

Ada Reeve, back again in Sydney, is in
the advance-guard of the Tivoli onslaught
ae-ainst gloom and the rvet-umbrella feeling.
Blending artistry with audacity, she grips
her crowd the moment the curtain goes up,
and retains her hold right through her turn,
which includes breezy ragtime songs and
comic numbers, with a sob recitation or two
thrown in. Sailing near to the wind at
times, she yet always manages to save the
blushes of the staid male escort. Other
newcomers are violinist Dot O’Farrell and
Irene M'idgley and Monte Wolfe.

Sparks are flying at Sydney Lyceum,
where “The Village Blacksmith” is hard
put to it to establish the innocence of a
comely daughter accused of absconding with
a wad of greenbacks. “The Shams of
Society” are revealed at the same house in
the old way—-the only change is in the style
of the tea-gowns and the name on the
cheques. Rodolph Valentino, “the screen’s
■perfect lover,” loses a lot of his glamor in
“All Night,” a complicated piece of domestic
foolery, filmed at the Globe. “Glimpses of
the Moon,” at the Strand, is rubbishy.
Monte Carlo is the background for the Picca-
dilly’s latest moral venture, “Foolish Wives,”
the outstanding point of which is that the men
who married the ladies were more foolish.

As “Whitehall” sees it:—
When the Australian art exhibition left for Lon-
don a brilliant Anglo-Australian painter observed:
“The real criticism will come from the leading
London artists —courtesy will prevent its being made
public.” It may be enlightening to consider the
attitude of the London men, as revealed by last
week’s cables, in the light of this judgment by one
who knows them and their conventions.
Two Australians exhibited who bore challenging
local reputations. Lindsay and Griiner have had the
invidious label “genius” affixed to them by their
fellow-countrymen. If such men as Orpen and Sims
had singled out this pair for detached appraisement
—stressing faults here, admitting some slight degree
of merit there —they would have produced the effect
of sincere painters performing a distasteful duty
in the interests of their profession. What they did
was not merely to abandon that bland and slightly
patronising British urbanity which was interestingly
evidenced in the fatuous remarks made about the
show by the Duke of Connaught, but to sail into the
idols of the Australian art-world with all the vehemence
of, ,and in much the same language as, the priests,
parsons, photographers, etc., who slang-whanged Lind-
say in the Australian press the other day. Orpen, for
example, found Lindsay “an extremely bad draughts-
man, with no sense of design and a total lack of
imagination,” one whose works were “stupid
blunders,” while Griiner’s “Valley of the Tweed”
(accepted here by many as his masterpiece) was dis-
missed as “hopelessly bad.” Now, this is not criti-
cism. It is spluttering abuse of the sort that might
be expected from the traditional old Indian army offi-
cer, filled with curry, bile and prejudices, and without
a vocabulary adequate to. express his teeming emo-
tions. Such furious disapproval becomes more re-
markable when set against the opinions of profes-
sional critics like Sir Claude Phillips and the man
who does the art column for the Pall Mall —as, for
instance, of Lindsay that “his power is wonderful.
He is a brilliant artist who, revelling in his con-
summate skill, dares and achieves what lesser men
would fear to approach.”
Uncritical criticism is unfortunately common
between artists in the same line of business. Southey
refused to his dying day to recognise* Byron as a
poet, and several times suggested that the supreme
artist who, in Taine’s phrase, was “so great and so
English that from him alone we shall learn more truths
of his country and of his age than from all the rest
together,” should be thrown into prison. Words-
worth (who, as a Bulletin writer recently noted, con-
demned the most exquisite lyric poet in the language
without having read a line he had written) referred
to Voltaire’s greatest satire as “This dull product
of a scoffer’s pen! ” What underlies such laches ?
Jealousy ? A certain amount of that enters half-
unconsciously into the thing, no doubt. Not all suc-
cessful men, nor all geniuses, for that matter, can
hear another’s praises gladly. But a more potent
factor is that fierce Puritanism which is at the base
of every true Britisher’s character, which is the key
to many of his actions, and which is capable of
bringing a London artist like Sir William Orpen
down to the cultural level of a “popular” Sydney
photographer like Mr. Mark Blow. Orpen is an
idealistic Irishman; Sims an English painter of
intensely ladylike nudes. Lindsay must be abhorrent
to both on “moral” grounds, though they would die
rather than admit it. His propaganda is as different
from theirs as Byron’s was from that of Southey,
poet-laureate and man of God. And Griiner, Lind-
say’s worshipper, attracts reprobation if only for
association’s sake.
Sydney’s brace of one-man shows:—
Alfred Coffey, vice-president of the Royal Art
Society, is hanging at Farmer’s about 70 canvases,
the result of a trip through the Dutch East Indies.
The subjects are mostly bits of old Batavia, land-
scapes in the volcanic country in Bali, and native
figure studies, with a makeweight in the shape of
an ornate funeral pyre in flames. Coffey, who paints
forthrightly, with little poetical stimulus, is most
successful with the dirty-white walls and doorways
under a glaring sun, and canal-side buildings with
varying color notes in the tiles. He has got some
really attractive results here, and the Sydney Gal-
lery has earmarked two of the best—“ The Moss-
Grown Tiles” and “Reflections in the Canal.” His
studies in the volcanic zone are stark, with an
interest mainly topographical, and his figure work
has a certain lack of elasticity which is in no way
helped out by the Oriental immobility of the sub-
jects. But it is a show well worth seeing.
Will Ashton —of the S. Aus. family—is scoring
a comforting crop of red tabs at his exhibition of
oils, drawings and etchings at Horderns’ Gallery,
which includes his “River Seine, Paris,” and “Cock-
spur-street, London” (Royal Academy and Royal
Institute of Oil Painters respectively), loaned by
their present owners, and several other fine canvases
painted abroad. The average of Ashton’s work since
his return to Australia is somewhat below his Old
World standard. He seems to have developed a
“thick” color, and is inclined to miss the penetration
of his native light. Very few of his Australian
studies have the luminous quality that marks those
turned out in Italy. He has paid a good deal of
attention to early-morning effects with considerable
success, but only in “Morning’s Silver Light” has
he shown an adequate appreciation of Jie fact that,
however distances may be misted, our morning light
is a particularly revealing thing where comparatively
near objects are concerned. One of his most attrac-
tive landscapes is “Summer Morning near Windsor,”
he has got close to what he wanted in the tumbling
waves of “Spring Tide, Austinmer,” and among the
less pretentious little things “The River Farm,
Windsor,” has been quietly touched in with a com-
mendable feeling. Ashton’s etchings are no more
nor less distinguished than those being turned out
by so many of our men from artistic or other
motives to-day: but his drawings show him a careful
and capable draughtsman—and therein he is of the
few rather than the many.
Adelaide, after its custom, rallied to “The
Beggar’s Opera” at the Royal as its run
went on, enjoying the quaint music, the
blunt humor mixed with satire on notables,
and the uniformly sound acting, in which
Eily Malyon stands away from the others
as a pure Hogarth caricature. This critic
finds unexpectedly that Gilbert got several
hints for his robbers and gaolers from Gay.
Fuller’s 11 apparently boneless wonders are
prominent in the variety programme at the
Majestic, where also Nellie Kobe uplifts a
strenuous and popular voice. The Reeve
sisters are still at the Prince of Wales, and
“MIS’ NELL O’ NEW ORLEANS," AT

the Big Four and the three Nitos round off
a good bill. “Rupert of Hentzau” is at the
York, and for once the insistent happy end-
ing is not bad art; there never seemed any
real reason why Anthony Hope should kill
his hero. At West’s, Madge Bellamy is in-
tense, and Mack Sennett foolish but funny :
and Wondergraph finds Viola Dana and
Mary M. Minter sufficient to fetch the crowd.

On a mummer who died in exile: —
Jerome Patrick, dead in America, was a native of
Dunedin (M.L.) and a dentist before he took to
the boards. Beginning with the Dunedin Operatic
Society (Harry Sherwood, in “Dorothy,” was one
of his parts), he crossed to Australia and played
minor roles with Julius Knight in “Ben Hur.”
Dissatisfied at not being offered better parts, he
refused to appear at all, announcing that he was
going to America. Said one of the Williamson
managers, “Do you know that in that country
there are 10,000 actors out of work?” Another
guyingly remarked, “Of course you will be accepted
in New York as a leading man!” Years later Jerry
told the writer that within a week of his arrival he
was engaged as a leading man—appearing in Chicago
in “The Escape,” and afterwards in the same pro-
duction at the New York Lyric. Followed engage-
with Klaw and Erlanger, Shubei't and Brady,
Morosco, the Frohmans, Flo Ziegfeld, and (in pic-
tures) Famous Players. He valued most his appear-
ances with Belasco, starring in “Marie Odile” and
“The Little Lady in Blue.” A Belasco letter he
had with him when he returned to this country con-
tained the sentence, “You may be certain that an
aeroplane will be at your window the moment 1 I
have something worthy of you”—a tribute that
might well have compensated Jerry for the appreci-
ation he failed to find in Australia.
“Norbell”: The late Jerome Patrick did a
lot of work for Julius Knight; afterwards he
was in Nellie Stewart’s “When Knighthood
Was in Flower,” “Sweet Kitty Bellairs,”
“Sweet Nell” and other pieces. A tall, fair
beauty-actor, he seemed full of promise in
those days, but American managers gave
him the opportunities which the Australians
failed to provide. The Taits brought him
back about four years ago to play the lead in
the wishy-washy “Daddies,” but he soon re-
turned to the near-free country. His widow
is a step-daughter of Clyde Meynell, of the
Firm.
“0.K.” : As far as Melbourne is concerned,
Lorna and Toots Pounds are not going to be
prophetesses in their own country. They
came back with an established London repu-
tation and a salary to match, but because
they are oddly unconventional in style they
have gone for not a third of their value. The
charm of originality which won them a posi
tion abroad has left a vast proportion of the
audience cold. The critical minority is de-
lighted with their unassertive art, individu-
ally and in duet, but you hear people who
gush over little Josie Melville remarking thaj
they are “disappointed” in the accomplished
Lorna and Toots. A pair of cut-and-dried
“serio-chronics” would have better pleased
the crowd, to whom the braininess of the
Pounds sisters makes no particular appeal.
“Mulgarri”: “Baskerville” (B. 4/10/’23)
misses when he implies that Ward had to
lay violent hands on Melb. Princess’s and
Palace because neither showed any prospect
of doing real business in the state they were
then in. Spring-cleaning or no Spring-
cleaning, the Princess’s would have drawn all
Melbourne with “The O’Brien Girl.” And it
was in the Palace that Ada Reeve estab-
lished a long-run record with “Spangles”
—and that was only last year. Hugh J.
didn’t have to eviscerate the auditorium and
convert it into the elegant thing it now is.
But he did so, and transformed the Prin-
cess’s as well, to give theatregoers an artistic
environment that other people had never
attempted to provide—that and comfortable
seating from the top shelf to the front
stalls, free cloaking, and a programme that
is not a trade-directory with a cast in the
middle.
SHOT AND SHELL.
The actor : “Yes, sir, someone aimed a base, cowardly egg at me."
THE SPENDER: “And what kind of an egg is that?”
THE ACTOR: "A base, cowardly egg, sir? A base, cowardly egg is one that hits you—
and then funs.”
“Minim”: Died in America a month or
two back, Gus Iverker, a composer of light
opera. His one claim to fame w r as that he
wrote the music for “The Belle of New’
York,” and that had had only a moderate
Broadway success when George Musgrove
bought the British rights. The Australian
entrepreneur liked Kerker’s tunes, and the
British public luckily agreed with him. Ker-
ker was a German, and although he lived in
America many years never became natural-
ised, which made things awkward for him
during the war.
“Griffith Moses” : Some fuss is being made
about the “revelation” of “Cheiro the Seer”
that the late Lord Kitchener came to him
for information about the manner of his
death. Cheiro bashfully admits that he was
right, as he invariably was, and told the
warrior that he would be drowned. Then
Kitchener, instead of settling on Australia’s
East-to-West railway, and becoming immor-
tal, and thereby settling a vexed question,
went to sea at the worst possible time, and
ions drowned. I may mention that I was
in the prophet business myself once. The late
Queen Anne w’as among my clients, though
she usually called in disguise, and she asked
me the same old question. I told her that
her end w’ould be hastened by drink, which
it was. This statement may look unreliable,
but then a great many autobiographical
statements do, and some of them are.
“Lord Quiz”: News of the Australian
actor, Harry Sweeney, now in America, is
that he has changed his stage-name to Henry
Mowbray, and as such is billed as Margaret
Anglin’s leading man. Margaret has finished
a course of Greek tragedy and returned to
modern comedy, and Mowbray, late Sweeney,
is mentioned as a likely Lord Illingworth
in a revival of Wilde’s “Woman of No Im-
portance.” One reason why Sweeney be-
came Mowbray is that the name proudly
associated in history with Todd, the Demon
Barber, has been vulgarised in a derisive
Yankee colloquialism. "Tell that to
Sweeney,” which has apparently the same
import as our “Dicken.”
“Te Babarantiko”: Captain Frank Hur-
ley deserves credit for being the first to
bring Irving scenes from the interior of
Papua before the public eye. It is a pity
that make-believe about them is so obtrusive
or, rather, that the running comment on the
screen is so misleading. The vessel invari-
ably awaits the party at “unknown” places.
A “plunge into the jungle” is conducted by
native guides along well-worn tracks ; and the
“explorers” approach a deserted native house
with caution, being “in extreme peril” of
ambush. Had the natives been really hos-
tile Hurley and his party would have been
cannibal meat any time the niggers chose.
And if the party’s “rush through a rain of
spears” hadn’t been staged for the cinema
one would be justified in concluding that the
niggers are exceptionally rotten marksmen
and incapable of making their living by the
chase, instead of being remarkably accurate
with their weapons.. I don’t want to carp,
but it is permissible to suggest that Austra-
lian films of so high a value for popular
instruction as Captain Hurley’s might be
screened without implied personal glorifica-
tion. When the world’s greatest big-game
hunter, F. C. Selous, showed his remarkable
African wild-animal films to Australians,
although they were obviously taken at per-
sonal risk the explanatory remarks were
mostly humorous. Here was an excellent
precedent for Hurley to follow’.
“J. 11.” (Lond.) : The English theatre is
going through a very thin time these August
days. More than half the principal play-
houses, including His Majesty’s, the Gaiety,
the Haymarket, Drury-lane, the Lyceum and
the Empire, have the shutters up. Butt’s
attempt to bring back old Leicester-square
days, when the Empire and its promenade
attracted all the young bloods, ended in dis-
aster. London simply wouldn’t have the
niggers brought over from Amurrika for
Butt’s revue, “The Rainbow.” Cochrane, too,
is feeling sorry about his noisy lot of black
brudders and sisters in “Dover-street to
“Dixie.” Cochrane’s other Yankee show.
Irving Berlin’s “Music Box Revue,” has like-
wise been a frost. Maggie Dickinson and
“Sid Culver” (once Sydney Yates) do a
couple of dancing turns in it, and Maggie is
about the only woman in the cast whose
enunciation is even passably distinct. But
London wearies of Yankee stuff, and is fed
up to the back teeth with coons.
More from William Maher: —
Harwood, I think, was the most versatile actor
Melbourne ever knew. I saw him as clown and
then lead in pantos, like “Jack Horner” and ‘ Robin-
son Crusoe”; as Michael Feeney to Barry Sullivan s
Shaun in “Arrah-na-Pogue”; as Chateau Renaud to
Robert Heir’s de Franchi in “Corsican Brothers ,
and as second to Walter Montgomery in “Macbeth
and “Richard III.” He was likewise the Ghost in
“Hamlet.” Then, going to comic opera, he made a
big suec<-s as the Duke in “Olivette” and also *n
“Tambour” ; while nothing could be better than his
work as the comic lead in “La Mascotte. And I
had almost forgotten his great turn as Cassandra in
that burlesque of the Siege of Troy. 1 saw h* s
massive tombstone last week in the General Cemetery.
It is in a spot where numbers of mummers are laid
to rest, among them John Dunn, Charles Vincent,
Tom Nunn, Hattie Sheppard, Marie St. Denis, Mrs.
Robert Heir and Ella Mortyn. Ella’s funeral is one
of my early recollections. She died in June, 1859,
and I note that the name of The Bulletin’s Oldest
Inhabitant is on the memorial stone as secretary to
the club which raised it. How I loved to see Mrs.
Heir in my kiddie days! I remember her best as
Romeo, with Barry Sullivan as Merciitio, Rosa Dunn
as Juliet, Robert Heir (the Friar), Alick Fitzgerald
(Tybalt), Lambert (the Apothecary), Mrs. Alfred
Phillips (the Nurse) and Charley Young (Peter) —
there’s a cast to think over. Rosa Dunn, at latest
advices, was living in Paris; the others are long dead.
“Lud”: Somerset Maugham’s comedy
“Our Betters” (B. 4/10/’23) will, if I’m
any judge, cause the critical fraternity to
sit up and take notice. It contains an episode
more daring than anything ever attempted
in the days of the old Palais Royal farces.
It is hardly surprising to hear by latest
exchanges that there is a rush to book seats.
Maugham’s newest play—he writds one about
every six months—is titled “The Camel’s
Back.” Wowsers in Cockaigne are likely to
describe “Our Betters” as “The Last Straw.”
“Mancam”: “liamfat” tells of Larry
Foley doing Charles the Wrestler for George
Rignold, but I never heard of Itignold pro-
ducing “As You Like It.” Larry really
appeared in Alfred Dampier’s version of the
comedy. He played the part in mutton-chop
whiskers.
William Devine winds it up :
“J. 8.” and “Namoi” (B. 4/10/’23) are not sure
whether Nellie Stewart appeared in “Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star” at Melb. Royal in 1873. I
can dispel their doubts—she did. She played the
part of Radianta. M I also recall that she and
her sister Maggie did a song-and-dance turn, a
novelty in those days. And it was not Nellie’s
debut, either; in March or April, 1872, I saw her
play Mercury in Offenbach’s “Orphee aux Epfers,”
and the Page in the same composer’s “Barbe Bleu,”
with Lyster’s Comic Opera Co., at the old Princess’s.
The co. was'first rate —-Alice May, Georgia Hodson,
Mrs. J. H. Fox, Jeannie Winston, Armes Beaumont,
T. H. Rainford, Charles Lascelles, and, as principal
comedian, Riehard Stewart, Nell’s • father. In
those days the Stewarts lived in Carlton. So did
1, and 1 used to see one or more of them every
day.
“Rolls Royce”: My admiration for “Mis'
Nell o’ New Orleans,” at Melbourne King’s,
is qualified by inability to accept C. M. llal-
lard and Martin Walker as members of an
inflammable Creole family. There is no
trace of the Creole in either impersonation.
Each man is what he is in private life —a
reasonably intelligent Englishman, with his
nationality conspicuous in the cut of his
clothes and in his address. Hallard is just
that type of man who carries absolute con-
viction as the stodgy country gentleman in
“Mr. Pirn Passes By.” He hasn’t a sugges-
tion of the warm South about him. Nor
has young Walker, who is plainly an English
public-schoolboy in everything he undertakes.
Walker’s idea of suitable attire at Mardi
Gras time is a costume that would admit him
to Melbourne’s Henley without a ticket. He
would pass unquestioned if he said “Clerk
of the course.”
From London Bridge, or thereabouts: —
Rosa Alba, the latest songstress from Australia,
lias made a successful debut at the Queen’s Hall
Proms.—a successful debut as far as the Voice
is concerned. That was praised by all the critics,
but some complain of the indifferent quality of
Rosa’s ditties. She started with a “Song of the
Water Nymphs,” by Arensky, which had been pro-
fusely puffed. It turned out a dud.
Malcolm MeEaehern, who has also been warbling'
at the Proms., struck the same trouble as Rosa.
The Times critic curtly remarks that “Mr.
MeEaehern will be heard at later concerts in better
songs.”
Other Australians well in the limelight are
Edward Cahill, the Queensland pianist, and George
Brooke, a tenor. They are appearing at the
Victoria Palace, and have made such a hit that
the audience wouldn’t let them go one night
without a speech.
Also, the Repertory Players are to produce Frank
Russell’s Australian comedy, “Harwood Blood.” It
was the winner among 300 plays submitted to the
R.P.’s, who hurl themselves at the public on
Sunday evenings.
William Archer’s “Green Goddess” is shortly to
break loose at St. James’s. Old members of the
Australian colony in London can recollect Archer
when he arrived from Queensland with a play
founded on the achievements of Ned Kelly. It was
produced at an East-end theatre, the Grecian, but the
profits hardly paid his passage money from Aus-
tralia. “The Green Goddess,” on the other hand,
has earned him barrels of money—all American thu«
far.
FACES ON THE SCREEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Edwin Geach, who has just returned to
Maoriland from America, warns Australasian girls
not to go to Los Angeles with the idea of securing
a footing in the movie world unless they have
something more than good looks to recommend them.
A beautiful face alone is insufficient; j’ou must have
a photographic one.”
Though you wouldn't swap your features with those
captivating creatures
Whom Tennyson in deathless verse addressed,
Helen whom—to Ilium’s chaos- —Paris pinched from
Menelaus,
Cleopatra, Jephthah’s daughter, and the rest;
Though with charms you may be laden richly as
the pauper maiden
Whom Cophetua selected for his queen,
Careless of her rags and tatters- —’tisn't that alone
that matters,
You must also own a dial that will screen.
A face may be sufficiently seraphic
To launch a thousand ships, or block the traffic
In Broadway or the Strand,
But please to understand
Where photo-plays are canned
The directors will demand
That the article is also photographic.
All the warm, alluring glories Swinburne weaves
around Dolores,
All the vampsomeness that throbbing rhyme can
paint
For a wowser’s sore displeasure may be yours in
fullest measure
(Though I’ll register a passing hope they ain’t).
Yet, albeit your lure coerces ’most as cogently as
Circe’s,
Or you look as sweetly fetching as Faustine,
What you first of all must prove is, ere they snap
you for the movies,
That you wear a smile that’s guaranteed to screen.
When the camera so capricious is in motion,
There might even be shortcomings, I’ve a notion,
That no optics could disclose
If a lady had to pose
In the loveliness that glows
Without a stitch of clothes
As Aphrodite rising from the ocean.
Though in some Australian city you are certified as
pretty
As a picture and as pleasing as a peach,
Though among your, acquisitions wins in beauty
competitions
You may number, lend a shell-like ear to Geach.
Admiration willy-nilly, like the whilom Jersey Lily,
You may note whene’er you float into the scene;
.Yob may tread on hearts like Sally (of the
bal’let, not the Alley)
And yet fail to cut the mustard on the screen.
Though your loveliness be Cyprian or Sapphic
Enough to make a Wesleyan picnic maffick,
Though they all acclaim you belle
In the circle where you dwell,
Better weigh the warning well
For ’twould be .a cruel sell
If your face should prove non-cinematographic.

the most convenient for cleaning and stropping.

A.R.M.: Sorry too late for consideration
—the Christmas Bulletin is already in type. (And
not a bad Christinas Bulletin either.)... .W.J.T.:
Perfectly good and correct verse, but without a
pulse and poor as Lazarus in ideas... .John S.: Neither
of them up P. (or some other initial) A.K.: The
verse is heavy and weak... . Aaroi: Can’t find the
mirth this time.... W.M.8.L.: Not quite enough in
tnem, nor quite enough skill John W.: Not for
us Yeileeu: Little hope for verse entitled
“The Student’’ that begins “To he who pensive sits.”
Even creaky commonplaces ought to be grammatical.
.... Old Papua: The verse is too crude to carry it.
. ...Alastor: Very bad.... Anon: “Milton” is like
a first attempt to say in a sonnet what everybody
has been saying for a century or so. “Quest” is
p00r.... King K.: As long as you’re satisfied to use
the first word that occurs to eke out a line you
haven’t much chance... .Margot M.: The main point
is true enough, but it doesn’t make a yarn.. . .
W.E.8.: The story doesn't touch reality... .Theophi-
lus P.: The milk hasn't improved during its long
rest.... A.R.I-I.; Fails.... Mombak: Here’s the most
thrilling part of it :
When he should’ve kept cool
Cop lost his wool,
He got an arm twist
With delight he did list
To the cracking of bone;
Wriggling out
Dick gave a clout,
One arm limply hanging
Furiously was banging
With a big stoue.
A.M.M.: Crude attempts to say what has often
been said better. .. .V.M.H.: Not for this market... .
F.J.F.: Far too obscure, and with too many cheap
tags. .. .M.W.8.: The “Boat Race” starts with bad
rhymes and then squelches off into no rhymes at
all; anu the absence of all form doesn’t help the
ideas. .. . G.E.A.: Terrible stuff....A.P.T.: A bald
catalogue of some of the facts about Spring is not
thrilling. .. .A. W.D.: They don’t strike us....Mar-
grett: Shocking. .. .R.A.F.: It doesn’t seen to mean
anything. . . .Cora F.: Weak and thin J.J.S.: Dull
and commonplace R.L.J.: The story of “Bill” is
quite artificial, with the end obvious from the be-
ginning. .. .W.W.A.: Those Indian gentlemen who go
about with cobras under their arms in Melbourne
suburbs to rescue distressed females are a disease,
not fiction... .C.R.C.: A refrain like “Ripple, ripple,
ripple, ripple” is not so enthralling as to he able
to stand without another live word H.J.E.: Yes,
we’ve heard that storms sometimes take place, but
a mere catalogue of things that happen when they
get busy doesn’t . move us E.W.C.: Not enough
in any of them. .. . A.G.8.: The verse doesn’t carry
the point—whatever it may be.. . .Senojo: They
fail because there is nothing in them to grip you.
....George C.: Horrible prose written in a manner
to cheat us into thinking it might be verse R.H.
(Bondi): No good. .. . G.W.W.: Too slight for its
heavy tread. .. .W.H.H.: Pretty well the limit of
futility... .M.C.M.: Why do the enthusiasts about
“Wisdom” always hymn it with weary common-
places in bad verse?. .. .Pax: “Ben Blogg” hobbles
along in crippled lines to nowhere in particular. . . .
H.J.J.: A mild variation of a thing- to be found in
half the autograph-albums in the world... .A.P.T.:
Keep on at the eisteddfods if they will give you
prizes for verse like that... .Billy B.: Sorry, but
there isn’t one we can take....Bellerive: “A Mid-
summer Fly’s Dream” is full of tender feeling:—
She’d gorged herself with table sweets,
And developed a drowsy feeling,
Slowly climbed the kitchen wall
For a nap upon the ceiling ;
Fevered was her lofty sleep,
She dreamt a big black spider
Darted from he’s netted lair
And grimly crouched beside her.
“Buzz,” said he, “thy reign is o’er,
I’ll add thee to my number.”
Clasped her in he’s deadly claws
In the vision of her slumber.
He drew her to he’s fatal web.
When, bewildered and nerve-shaken,
From the horror of her awful dream
The poor fly did awaken.
.. . . L.M.C.: The twins don’t persuade us that they’re
real howling, clawing flesh and b100d.... Caesar: The
same old “Dad” in rather worse verse than usual.
. ...B.B.: Conventional... .J.K.R.: Commonplaces
without inspiration.... Steele G.: It’s a long, long
way from scoring... .S.D.C.: Old hard-worked gags
tacked to an uninteresting person called 80b....
H.H. (Kirribilli) : Not enough there... .D.P.J.: Your
“Old Crone” isn’t a very interesting female
Louis S.: No, we don’t pronounce ma “maw,” but
neither do we pronounce it “mar”... . 5.1. C.: It
can’t be done much worse than that. The very best
recitations are not much more futile.. . .T.I-I.B.: Sorry,
no g00d....L.M. (Gisborne): The tender ditty about
your “Australian” home wails vainly.... .Evowen:
The yarn is no better than the title, which is not
Maori.... Helen B. (W.A.): Hasn’t even a resem-
blance to verse.... Augustus W.: Ah, this is most
comforting:—
Sooner a Camel through the eye of a needle will go,
Than a Rich man’s Soul to heaven will flow,
The Pope is the richest man in the World—
Just like Mil'ionaires, who won the gold.
Priest and Parsons, praying to the poor,
Travel first class—they know by lore.
Be poor ,and starve, you never come to hell;
Only the Rich ones, who are living so well.
Rich treasure and pleasure are evil;
Any Rich Man will be taken by the devil.
So poor people work and slave.
Then your Souls all will be saved.
Let the Rich people live in pleasure;
In heaven you will get your treasure.
B.L. (Whangarei): Too slight 1.8. W.: The
last time we heard a noise like your verse makes was
when we tried to do a bit of carpentry with a blunt
saw.... Dorcas: You’ve got the materials. Now see
if you can’t marshal them into an orderly yarn....
Sernaj: Try something else Tar Pot: The Bulle-
tin pays for everything it prints F.R.G.: Already
paragraphed... .G.G.R.: On the border-line; but
hardly enough new observation in it Justus: There
is no real feeling ; it is too obviously a faked emo-
tion.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H. 8.: A long-legged person named Sabine got off
that jo-ke while walking into Adelaide one morning
30 years ago... . A.K.: An appalling effort. .. .M.J.:
Aot up to the mark yet.... J.A.C.: No way at all.
. ...M.8.C.: Fascinating feet your people have....
E.lv: The mother who threatened to pass baby’s
booze on to the gentleman has long had a bed in
the Home for the Aged K.M.: Drawing still very
wobbly.... M.R.: You and the accountant are hardly
likely to meet yet awhile A.G.M.: Been done
before J.C.S.: Not quite up L.E.T.: Poor kid
seems terribly deformed. .. .R.8.L.: Once again, why
not try something Australian?

“5.E.0.” : The bush is not the best place
to go for good fence-posts nowadays. The
demolishing of slums and near-slums about
Sydney yields a harvest of 4 x 2 and 6x3
joists that have been seasoning for anything
from 30 to 70 years. White-ants can do no-
thing with them. Unfortunately, the nails
can only be broken off; they will not draw
from these blue-gum and ironbark sticks. But
in any case a man would have too much re-
spect for his cutting tools to use them upon
most of these lumps of vegetable steel.
“E.A.’s” belief (B. 27/9/’23) that
the B.A.T.C. desires nothing more than to
foster the growth of tobacco in Australia
is touching, but hardly supported by the facts.
Granted that the company has been prodigal
of offers to buy suitable Australian-grown to-
bacco, and, further, to supply cocky with free
expert advice re growing and curing, the price
it is actually prepared to pay has seldom been
reasonable, from the grower’s viewpoint.
Two years ago, at the suggestion of the
8.A.T.C., a soldier-settler neighbor of
mine planted several acres of tobacco. The
co.’s expert visited him several times, and
just prior to harvest announced the crop
was excellent and well worth top prices—
say, 3s. to 3s. 6d. per lb. The tobacco was
flue-cured by an experienced man, and turned
out well. Then the buyer arrived, and re-
marked that the stuff was scarcely worth
buying, but to encourage him to plant next
year he would give Is. 6d. per lb. There
were no other buyers. So the offer was per-
force accepted, but the cocky swears he will
see Australia smokeless before he plants an-
other acre. “E.A.” further suggests that
Australian-grown tobacco is mixed with im-
ported, because the former is inferior. The
fact is simply that Australian smokers are
used to the flavor of Virginian tobacco, and
demand it. It isn’t better, but it is different,
because the climate and the soil in which it
is grown are different. The only remedy is
to impose such a thumping duty that the
tobacco cos. will be forced to manufacture
and Australians to smoke the home-grown
leaf, which is no whit inferior in aromatic
or burning properties to imported leaf.
“Chanticleer” defends the hen : •
I have sampled a good many industries in Australia
from North Queensland to South Aus., and since the
year the war started have tried poultry-farming,
and I assert that it is the least precarious one-man
industry of them all. The N.S.W. Government expert
lately said a man could make a living from 600
hens. I last year paid income-tax 0 n £162
with only 260 fowls.. I have a neighbor
who served 21 years in the Imperial Army
-India, S’Africa and elsewhere. He came to Aus-
tralia with the few pounds he had saved and a pen-
sion—-not an A.I.F. pension. He carried his swag out
on to his time-payment block, put up his tent and
bogged in. He scrubbed, grubbed, fenced, etc., going
tq work outside at times to raise funds. To-day he
has a place worth £4ooo—'in an expert’s hands; a
fool could write it down 76 p.e. in 12 months. That
he was 21 years without a stripe proves he is no
genius.
I had no special training at all. The ex-imperial
man not know a leghorn from a wyandotte, and
was “boxed” by poultry sharks for a start. Another
neighbor, an ex-pressman, badly wounded in the
recent box-on and still suffering, had exactly the
same training at Grantham a s the rest of the Diggers
who went poultry-farming at Milperra. He would be
insulted at an offer of £l5OO for his five-acre
poultry-farm. The Milperra settlement is surrounded
by poultry-farms, several of the most successful in
the State among them. There was also a resident
instructor trained at Grantham. How many of the
men took occasion to visit and have confabs with the
successful neighbors? Or heeded- the instructor’s
teachings? It is no good blaming the hens. They
were not consulted.
As a matter of fact it is the roosters that are
to blame —the departmental and profiteering roosters.
The land on which Milperra stands was unsaleable.
At pre-war rates the improvements on any of the
farms would have cost £4OO at the outside. What
an orgy it was! Wire-netting jumped from 13s. to
525., galvanised-iron from 7d. to about Is. 2d. a
foot, timber from about 14s. to 38s. and everv
other line accordingly. Labor was put on to stack
and burn bush timber. Fences and poultry-houses
built of similar timber put in before the war are
still standing in the district to day. And because
fowls don’t lay to pay for it all, they are a “pre-
carious venture.” Even if they were all Hawkes-
bury-eompetition winners they could not make any-
thing of it under such handicaps.
THE UNCHANGING CABBY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Hand a Sydney taxi-driver his legal fare for tak-
ing you to Randwiek on Derby Day and you will
hear a new estimate of yourself.’— Daily Telegraph.
If you have a hankering after new sensations, if
you’re anxious to find
How unflattering a portrait of yourself you can
screen on a fellow creature’s mind,
It isn’t necessary to emulate Horatio Bottomley’s
transactions scaly
With a view to hearing a I'esumS of your unengag-
ing qualities at the Old Bailey.
You needn’t even write poems like Montgomery’s or
biographies such as Uroker could do,
And despatch copies to some modern Macaulay with
a request for the favor of a review.
Aou needn’t rush into a sectarian controversy as a
naked and unashamed bigot;
You needn’t perjure yourself as whole-heartedly as
a Titus Oates, a Barsad, a Cly or a Pigott.
A less heroic but quite as efficacious a plan is to
take a taxi to Randwiek, and having been
deposited there
Present 'the driver with his statutory fare.
If you want to see how much scorn and contempt
the human eye can convey,
Transcending that accorded to Pontius Pilate and J.
Iscariot at an Ober-Ammergau passion play ;
If you fain would watch a strong man’s frame with
utter loathing and repulsion shake
Like that which agitates a delicate woman when she
treads on a cockroach or a snake;
If you wish to hear some remarks directed to show-
ing that for meanness you make an also-ran of
Shylock the Jew,
And that “a collier’s whelp nosing for scraps in the
galley” is a noble animal compared with you ;
If, in fine, you would learn how unfavorable an im-
pression you may make on another human being
inside of a minute,
Try the recipe. I’ll lay six to four there’s something
in it.

-your new Piano-Player marks the beginning of a new era, es-
pecially as regards the playing of accompaniments to songs.”
Celebrated English Baritone sings to Accompaniment aP
THE NEW BEALE PLAYER-PIANO
A Player-Piano
for <£l9B
See the new Beale "Five -
77;ree”Player-Piano. This
is the instrument that has
created new standards in
player-piano values. Endor-
sed by eminent authorities
as an instrument of superb,
artistic merit. Has genuine
ivory keyboard, silver-steel
strings, genuine Mahogany
casework (or English Quar-
tered Oak for £193), finest
spruce sound-board, etc. A
quality production through-
out. Sold on very easy terms,
TF one thing, more than another, can demonstrate the wonder-
■*- fully human-like capacity of the New Beale Player-Piano, it is
surely the great flexibility and instantaneous response that it
possesses —the characteristics that make the truly gifted accom-
panist a man apart.
Mr. Haigh Jackson, the celebrated English baritone, was particu-
larly impressed with this quality when he recently sang to an
accompaniment on the New Beale, and few singers are more quali-
fied than he to pass an authoritative opinion. Mr. Jackson is an
Associate (with Honours) of the Royal Academy of Music,
London. He has studied under Jean de Reske and has appeared
professionally at Covent Garden, London, in Paris, New York,
Chicago, Munich and Berlin. He has sung with Melba, Caruso,
Tetrazzini, Chaliapin, Van Rooy, and his Grand Opera Reper-
toire embraces forty-nine different roles. He accompanied Dame
Melba on her Australian tour and was personally requested by
the great Diva to take charge of the Vocal Department of her
Conservatorium.
Both the New Beale Player-Piano and Piano have the highest
commendation from many eminent musical authorities. As
instruments of artistic merit they leave nothing that the cultivated
musician desires. Encased in walnut, mahogany and rosewood ;
other rare cabinet woods to order. Used pianos and player-pianos
accepted in partial exchange for New Model Beale instruments.
Extended payment plan over any period up to three years.

J. N. M. Lawrence, of the Anglican Sea-
men’s Mission at Port Adelaide, makes a
long jump to a similar billet at Callao in
Peru. He has put in over 10 years in S.A.,
and has made only one condition as to the
S. American appointment —that he shall be
free to return to Australia after three years
exile,
“Chids” : The bones of the luckless Gov-
ernor Eardley Wilmot (B. 27/9/’23) do
not remain in Australia. Although he was
buried at Hobart his body lay in old St.
David’s cemetery for only three years. It
was then exhumed and sent to its final rest-
ing-place in England. The coffin was found
ui perfect order, except for a little rust on
the handles. Even the red drawings were
intact. The original Gothic cenotaph still
stands.
“Pat Bushie”: A telegraph messenger
from a suburban p.o. took his bike to the
repair depot at the G.P.0., Newcastle. ‘B ix
it straight away,” lie said: “I hate two
urgent wires to deliver.” "You’ll have to
wal> with them,”* he was told; “the bike
won’t be fixed until to-morrow.” Well.
I’ll deliver ’em then." said the nipper casu-
ally as he walked out.
“Loco” : I don’t suppose it. has any bear-
ing on the Bellbird disaster, but it may be
worth mentioning that I have occasionally
found ‘‘live” explosives amongst the coal
on my railway engine. I _ saw a gelignite
cartridge, with portion of fuse attached,
picked out of the coal only recently. What
precautions are taken to prevent this? The
things that would happen if an unexploded
charge got into a firebox aren’t pleasant for
an engine-team to think about.
Still living in Sydney is the daughter of
the founder* of the township of W'auchope—
Captain W'aucli, of the 48th Regiment. When
he arrived in Australia to take up the grant
available, to retired army officers, his daugh-
ter, who became first Mrs. Salwey and then
Mrs. W’ethenll. was six years of age. She is
now 93. AVauch threw away what would
have been a fortune by abandoning his grant
when the Government withdrew the 16
assigned convict servants who had been
allotted to him.
“T. 0.1.”: Pope Cooper was a grandson
of Robert Cooper, of Juniper Hall, Padding-
ton (Sydney)—a house built about a cen-
tury ago and still sound. The grandad
was an auctioneer and distiller, and an ad-
vertisement of 1830 reads: "The Brisbane
Distillery (Mr. R. Cooper) is an extensive
pile of buildings, where the business is now
carried on, and an excellent spirit produced
very similar to London gin.” The Black-
friars School buildings, in George-street
West, now cover the site of the distillery.
“Cartot” : The German corpse-factory yarn
(B. 27/9/’23) is more likely to have had
its origin in Fritz’s method of dealing with
dead horses. It began when the Germans
were terribly short of fats, on account of
the naval blockade, and as lubricants for
machinery were a vital necessity in the field,
a factory was established to extract the fat
from equine carcases. When the place was
captured during a British advance, some-
body with a fertile imagination started the
human glycerine yarn.
“Pooh Bah”: “Loco” needn’t worry be-
cause a tower viewed from a railway engine
has shifted a point or two (B. 13/9/’23).
The phenomenon is due, not to any distor-
tion of this planet’s surface, but to his pro-
motion to the left side of the footplate. An
engineman cannot see immediately ahead be-
tween the metals unless he is in front of
the smoke-box, and what appears to be dead
ahead of the fireman (over the right-hand
rail) is actually a little to the left of the
track, and appears to be more so from the
driver’s point of view. Let “Loco” test this
by sketching a ground plan, and lie can con-
vince himself that the permanent-way gang
has not been moving the line.
“The Wanderer” : John Notley, a pioneer
of the Belmore River (North Coast,
N.S.W.), who died recently, was, in the
days when our beards grew long and tangled,
foreman of & jury at the Kempsey Quarter
.Sessions, when a prominent J.P. of the.time
was on trial charged with stealing a bottle
of whisky. The jury debated long as to
whether a verdict of guilty should be re-
turned, “with a strong recommendation to
mercy,” or one of just plain “Not guilty.”
When they returned into court John nearly
paralysed Judge Fitzhardinge by announc-
ing the verdict as “Not guilty, with a strong
recommendation to mercy.” “What’s that?”
snapped Fitz. “Well,” replied Notley, “I’m
not used to the ways of the Court—it’s ‘Not
guilty.’ ” Notley came from Worcestershire,
and when he took a trip to the Cold Country
years ago, a friend who saw him off on the
return jaunt gave him a bag of apples to
comfort him on the voyage. Eating the last
one as the vessel entered Sydney Harbor,
Notley decided to save the pips and plant
them on his farm at Belmore River. One
grew, and in due course bore some of the
finest apples ever grown in the Maclcay
district.
“Xox” on the joys of landlord i ng:—-
Robert McGregor, who represents Ballarat East in
the Vic. Parliament, regaled the House with his
experience as a benevolent landlord. He had taken
pity on a. family that had been evicted, offering
them a newly-renovated home for, 6s. a week. To
help his new tenants, he found Dad a job. When
three months went by without any appearance of
cash, he ventured to ask for a trifle, and was told
by tlie wife that the burden was too great, but
the debt would be liquidated if he reduced the rent
to ss. McGregor agreed, whereon another three
months’ payments accumulated. Then the rent-
col lector reappeared a little diffidently, to be assured
that the coin would be forthcoming if the daughter
of the house could be found 'a place in one of the
local woollen mills. McGregor’s generosity was
equal to that demand ; but he is still waiting for
his money. He can count himself lucky, for all
that. A similar kind of landlord who was put off
from month to month discovered when he called
down in person to collect a bit of the rent that
his tenants, who had been previously apprised of
his intention, were piling up their goods on the
footpath and acquainting the vicinity that they had
been shot out by a brutal landlord. The neighbors’
looks informed him that he needn’t tarry in quest
of settlement. In fact, a forward movement by
the scowling populace decided him to turn round
and go for his ’life.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

laj silvered purple leaves the blossom moon
Sways to the tremulous music of the
night. ,
Fl . os t whispers stir the grass and on the
height
The lustrous forests in a long, low croon
Murmur of Spring, the loiterer, that soon
mnll dress the western slopes m bridal white
\iul with pink, scented stars and yellow light
Fill all the laughing hollows of the noon.
Oh sap-song of the high undaunted trees !
Oh little world half-frozen for an hour!
Oh’ little dream of summer in the cold !
Thp unresting quiet of great mysteries
!ul t he soft pollened night in fullest flower
Have left the worm too silent and too old.
11.
Farth is too young for all its heavy clay.
Too full of mirth for this great weight of stone
• That weighs the mountains down to yield
no tone
When smitten with the bell-tongues of the
day. _ , . . n
To-night small laughters round the circle play
Or race the dreaming airs from zone to zone;
And I, who also dream, am not alone,
Bat girt with blithe companions on the way.
I have but seen one moon in fifty years;
Yet in her rounded magic faith is fire
To burn with opulent flame all trustless noons
That turned to iron system earth’s soft tears.
Ilow shall it be when, matching my desire,
God swings at night His fifty thousand
moons?
111.
Chained to eternal thought, the anguished sun
Barns up the days with his resistless might;
And Death and Law forever in his light
Break the clear circle ere the thought is
w0n....
Take out the steeds; the chariot race is
run —
Life is a singing of the air, a flight
As of a random arrow in the night
That breaks the latest thread the spider
spun.
Laugh, full round moon, to hear the ancient
lie!
The mountain is not stone: there is no grave
Of old life hidden in the sandstone cliff.
Oh, call me up the ladders of the sky !
The splendid night with frosty air is brave,
And all Law fails against the dream-word
-if.
IV.
If there be choice of gypsies and of kings,
I leave the Court and take the open way.
The caravan with mist is silver-grey,
A bell upon the broken harness rings,
And every wheel-spoke very softly sings
The roadside song that conquered yesterday.
Come, seeker of old knowledge gone astray,
Thought is but dust when it forgets its wings.
Beyond the gypsy road there is a cell
Full of grey crucibles and golden dreams,
And keys of fated magic red with rust.
Did God forget to make us men ? Ah, well,
Catch at the moon! We have a thousand
gleams
To weld to purpose in the moonlit dust.
V.
Sun, moon and Law, and mockery and cold
fear.
Shall these make man where graves were dug
so long?
A shovelful of clay has quenched a song,
A breath of frost has stayed the singing year
Through all the changing days that men
held dear.
Ah, the Spring came again and wrought
strange wrong
To thp brown leaves —-a cold, unquiet throng
That danced in death when the warm winds
drew near.
V hat purpose were in this, that some full
brain
Should feed a corn-root for the growth of
bread
Ilith cannibal earth-lust to harvest death?
Auer the worms shall there be joy of rain?
Shall happy laughter move the dust long

About the garden gates. Now in the heights,
trom her great purple stairway’s cloudy

The moon is but a dream of the great sun,
A cold reflection of his hurtling fire,
An echo of the terrible far truth....

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Tonic for Uncle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SPRING had come again, and with
Micky the boy as engineer, and
Denny Deneen, as owner in command,
the travelling store was drawn on its weekly-
voyage by a hairy-footed black horse —a horse
that had, as Denny said, “only two paces—
a shmall gallop or a shtandshtill”—through
Quart-pot Creek at the township, and
through the granite sand thereof, and up the
granite rise on the other side, and then over
the hills and far away.
Denny condescended to travel with his
cart only on compulsion; this day he had
been forced to the journey because Putti-
foot, his man, had at last prevailed on Denny
to give him a 14-days’ vacation. So much
are men the slaves of habit that Mr. Putti-
foot’s holiday still made him visit the
butcher’s shop every day as one of the curi-
ous public and a lounging critic who gave
lofty directions to his understudy, the youth
promoted for two weeks to the work of
breaking down beef and mutton. This criti-
cism made Puttifoot very happy, although he
used two hours a day for it; the others of
his waking hours were given to the courting
of Mrs. Choquindie, already yielding indi-
cations of softening, and the consequent dis-
covery that the planet of love was over the
horizon and beginning to climb on high.
So Denny, the owner, was also captain
on this day and for the 10 days to come;
and while Micky sat on the front rail ot
the cart and “fussed” the black horse to keep
him in a pace that was not a standstill,
Denny studied the list of his debtors on the
day’s round of Apple Valley, and criticised
them as usual—well, or in highly disrespect-
ful terms.
“Cleghorn, the dam’ loafer. P»e gob, he's
down for 10 pound, an’ he never worrked
in his life. An’ that tine lad Jimmy and
his sister Milly and them poor little childer
worldn’ for that loafer that ates meat by
the bullock and eggs by the clutch. An’ is
that other dam’ loafer, ‘the Bishop,’ slitill
there, Micky?”
“Yes,” squeaked Micky, “he’s been there
32 munce, an’ never done a hand’s turn.
Him an’ ole ‘Poor cow me’ sits on the ver-
andah and tells Jimmy what to do.”
“Great verandah farmers they are, plan-
tin’ millions uv orchards in their moinds.
Dirty dogs! Leavin’ Jimmy shweat there
with catch-crops till the new threes grow;
fellin' .Timmy how Uncle used to grow t’ings
on his farrrm in London ; guzzlin’ the tea an’
sugar Jimmy buys for them with cabbages,
an’ ’atin’ the childer’s bread.”
“Jimmy’s got another bloke workin’ with
him—Bill Bringalily.”
“Is that young Bill Inglis, then?”
“Yairs, he’s a pretty ole bloke, though;
20, anyways.”
“He owes me seven pound, and he was
always to his toime! What’s gone wrong
wit’ him?”
“He works for Cleghorn, an’ don’t get no
wages.”
“What’s he do it for, then? Hasn’t he
’is own place, then —wit’ ’is young orchard,
then? Why doesn’t he grow his catch-crops,
then?”
“He does a bit, but he works for Cleg-
horn for nothin’ because he’s gorn on Milly.”
“Milly Cleghorn, a child! Why, she’s but
14 or so —Jimmy’s on’y 16.”
“She looks grown up. She’s a nice piece,
too.”
“ ’Tend t’ your horrse, y’ impudent t’ing—
■tend to your horse. A ‘nice piece,’ says you.
I’ll give you a nice piece of me fut in your
coat-tails —tw r ice in concussion.”
Thus crushed. Micky returned to “fussing”
the hairy-footed horse, and Denny, breath-
ing heavily his indignation of this careless
deseription of a girl as “a piece,” returned
to his study of the debtors. They drove in
silence for a mile, past orchards vocal with
peach and almond bloom against the grey ot
the granite, the Noah’s Ark green of the
pines and the black blur of the forest; hold-
ings attended by the travelling store earlier
in the week. The orchards of the good men
showed the new lush green of catch-crops
between the serried ranks of fruit-trees and
grape-vines—cabbage, pea, tomato, potato and
bean ; oats and barley and very infrequently
maize; all this effort bettered by the con-
trast of the orchards of weary men—young
trees discounted by undergrowth and
strangled by tall grass.
Conversation being interdicted, and the
prospect of a long life without speech weigh-
ing heavily on Micky, that energetic child
took from the box in the front of the cart
a mask of a very white face and goggle eyes
and a tip-tilted red nose and profuse white
whiskers, purchased by him on his last visit
to Warwick —an excursion of blessed mem-
ory. This mask Micky fastened by its elas-
tic band to his head and immediately became
an old white-whiskered, red-nosed, pale-faced,
goggle-eyed man, with the long, thin body
of a very tall, immature boy. He looked
through the mask at the hairy-footed horse,
and aided by the mask at once mentally
became a bushranger—the Very Bad Old
Man of Bushrangers. In his mind also
Micky did some astounding things—robbed
banks and rescued Milly Cleghorn from Cleg-
horn’s uncle, “the Bishop.” and then admin-
istered 50 lashes each to the Bishop and Cleg-
horn. While doing all these things in his
mind he forgot to “fuss” the hairy-footed
horse, and the animal slowed to his other
pace—which was merely standing still.
Denny Deneen looked up from his studies
and said impatiently “Micky,” and then
as the driver turned to him Denny saw the
preposterous face, and almost fell out of
the cart. Micky tore off his mask, and
Denny’s fright became rage.
“Curse o’ Crummle on ye! Frightenin’ a
man out o’ his seven sentences! Where’d
you get that blasphemious t’ing?”
“I —I —bought it in Warwick. I’m doin’
no harm !”
“Doin’ no harrrm! Shtick to your job or
it will lave you. ‘Fush’ your horse—he’s
houldin’ up his wan leg for keeps ag’in.”
Micky restored the mask to its place in
the front of the cart, and sulkily “fussed”
the horse into a shambling trot again. Sud-

Stop That Nagging Backache.
”Ev<tiy Picture
ta tells a Story'
TS
wA
Is a dull, nagging backache making you miserable? Do
sharp, knife-like pains go through you at every sudden
move? Do you feel weak, tired, all worn-out —as if
you just can’t keep going? It’s time, then, you found
out the cause of the trouble and made some effort to
correct it. Quite likely it’s your kidneys. A cold,
strain or overwork has probably weakened the kidneys,
and that is why you suffer that dull, depressing back-
ache and those sudden, stabbing pains. You may have
daily headaches, too, with spells of dizziness and some
annoying kidney irregularity. Don’t wait until serious
or chronic kidney disease sets in. Get back your health
while you can. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Doan’s have helped scores of Sydney folks. They
should help you. Ask your neighbor.
INTERESTING SYDNEY EVIDENCE.
A WOMAN’S CASE. f: : 1
• -fy V;
Mrs. E. Mayhew, 48 Alexander Street, Alexandria, Sydney, says':—“l suffered
from backache and rheumatic pains, all over my body, and was sometimes so bad
that I was almost crippled. I could not stoop without enduring torture; in fact,
every movement meant increased suffering, and I often used to feel quite knocked
up. To make matters worse, my rest at night was disturbed and I was also
subject to dizzy attacks. - ” One (lay a friend heard Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
very well spoken of, so she advised me to try them. I bought a bottle without
delay, and after taking them for a few days my health began to improve, so I
persevered, and by the time I had used three bottles I was cured. The backache
and rheumatism have gone completely, and I feel splendid in every way.”
Four years later Mrs. Mayhew says :-‘-“Since giving my testimony for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills I have haid a slight return of kidney trouble, but I again
used this fine remedy and it soon fixed me up. I strongly recommend Doan’s Pills
to all who suffer with their kidneys.”
A MAN’S CASE,
Mr. Jas. Wilson, 17 Little Buckingham Street, Sydney, says:—“For a long
time I suffered torture from backache and kidney trouble. The pains in my back
were very severe, and I have been so bad that I could not attend to my work, as
every movement caused positive torture. The kidney secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy and containing a red sediment. I was also subject to
dizz> feelings and could not sleen properly at night. Nothing I took gave me
any permanent relief, but one day, when I was feeling very bad, I heard good
reports of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so I sent for some, and after taking
seven bottles I was cured. This remedy not only banished the backache, but
strengthened and toned up my kidneys and improved my general health.”
Mr. Wilson confirms the above eight years later, and says:—“l am still a
great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and always- have a bottle in the
house. By taking them every now and again my kidneys keep in a healthy state,
and I am never troubled with backache.”

denly the track opened out to a clearing,
and there was 10 acres of beauty praising
the effort of man—bloom and leaf, growth
and loveliness, pink of fruit-bud and green
of the catch-crops. Irritation and sulkiness
were forgotten.
“By cripes, it’s bonzer !” said Micky.
“Thrushes singin’ in the heart of a man,”
said Denny.
Cleghorn’s orchard, as yet new from a
bush-fire but all replanted and well tended,
showed the healthy green of the new leaves-
on the little trees of peach and apple, and
the brown sticks that were two acres of new
vines, sore with their first buds. A new
house lifted its new galvanised-iron roof as
silver to the sunlight; one of the old peach-
trees had survived the fire, and its pink buds
spotted the air. Jimmy Cleghorn. now a man
nearly 16 years old, filled his 10th bag of
cabbages, and, hot on the achievement, called
to his mate, Bill of Bringalily, who worked
a dozen rows a day.
“I’ve done 10 bags. Bill.”
“Nine for me—l’m startin’ the 10th now.”?
Mrs. Cleghorn, at the-washtub in the lee-
of the house, heard them, and smiled encour-
agement to them, although they were too far
off to see the smile; Milly, the girl of 14 or
more, suspended for a moment the sweeping
of the verandah to look at her brother and
then at Bringalily Bill. She was shooting up
with the grace of a young palm, although
her shoulders were slightly bent; for to her,
as to her mother and to Jimmy and the
smaller children, work was endless, and life
all effort. Yet she was growing finely, the
ugly duckling unconsciously and almost in-
visibly coming to the grace of the swan.
Yet there was not all effort here. Papa
Cleghorn, seated on the verandah-steps read-
ing a paper and sucking at his pipe, un-
lighted because lie was too weary to go into
the house for a match ; and Uncle —the uncle
of Mrs. Cleghorn—stroking his little white
whiskers, cocking his pious eye at his foot,
alleged to bp still poisoned, although his
alleged accident was a year old. and resting
himself on an old colonial sofa under the
western wing of the verandah —these toiled
not neither did they spin, not even yarns.
“A mad bloke’s got away from a pleece-
man at Dalveen,” said Cleghorn, retailing
all the attractive news.of the week-old news-
paper.
“Them pleece oughter be ’shamed o’ their-
selves,” commented Uncle. “All Irish loaf-
ers, that’s what!” - - *
“The bloke what killed the other bloke
got hesself hanged !”
“That’s nice,” said Uncle; “read us about
that.” /
“Nothin’ about it,” repeated Cleghorn, too
weary to read even such charming litera-
ture as the report of ah: execution. “Jia&’
’anged. ilhu’s Ml.”
He suddenly'awoke fo the fact that Milly
had again suspended - sweeping to look at
Bill, who knew she looked, and, therefore,
worked as two men, his good-looking face
Hushed with the work, his long body work-
ing tirelessly and as without effort. For
this he partially neglected his own land and
worked with Jimmy for nothing—for Milly,
but also for Jimmy, his mate. It was a
better Jacob working for a finer Rachei,
and keeping in idleness a most contemptible
Laban; but here the parallel would end, for
the Jacob of Bringalily was no cattle-duffer,
and Cleghorn had but one cow. From Milly
the loafer’s eye wandered to Bill, now giving
her look for look; and all a father’s righteous
indignation expressed itself in the snarling
order to Milly: “Go inside Sand mend y’r
stoekuns.” “
As she disappeared, her face aflush with
shame where there was none, Uncle spoke
the thought of Cleghorn, who had also lec-
tured Bringalily Bill.
“He’s pretty good atiworkin’.”
“Oh, yes: y’r can’t" afford to stop ’em
workin’.”
Cleghorn stood up and attempted to walk,
trod on his own bootlace, and almost fell
down.
“He’s a scientific loafer, is your old man,”
said Bringalily, now working close to
Jimmy, and speaking with all the frankness
j; of mateship. “He nearly come a sugardoodle
Sjuandin’ on his own feet.”
Ay "lie’s got me beat,” replied Jimmy. “I’m
tired askin’, him to do anything. I’d clear
out only for mother an’ the kids.”
“I wouldn’t stand a bar of him—only
for”
“Milly?”
“And you, Jim. That old cow, Uncle, with
the white lace curtains on his face—when-
ever I see his whiskers I want to tie a
blue ribbon on ’em and send him up to the
agricultural show and poke a stick in his
ribs until he says ‘Baa.’ ”
“Old waster he .is, Bill. 1 says to him
yestiddy, ‘Why don’t y’ do somethin’ in the
house?’ An’ he says he brought a picture
for it.”
“A picture? He brought one o’ them darn’
texts- to hang upon the wall —‘The Lord Will
Provide,’ Somebody’d have to provide or
the old cow’d starve. Gimme a lift of the
bag, and we’ll get the cabbages .out to the
road.”
Taking two bags, one upon the other, and
each grasping two corners of the lower bag,
they began transport to the track, to await
the arrival of Denny Deneen.
“I don’t want to see him,” said Bringa-
lily; “I owe. him a few quid.”
They proceeded with the carrying of 105(i
large cabbages in bags, to be 'transported
to the railhead by Denny Deneen, and con-
signed by-him to Brisbane for sale against
the store account, and were bringing the last
bag when a small Cleghorn, aged six, ran
from the winding bush-road to the sliprails
and cried, “The cart’s cornin'.”
Milly dropped the broom. Mrs. Cleghorn
left the washtub. The small girl came from
the. house carrying the most recent baby.
Cleghorn sighed, and addressed himself to
the terrific strain of walking to the gate;
and Uncle, forgetting his poisoned foot for
a moment, and then hurriedly securing his
crutch and walking-stick, made his way to
the road as Micky drove up and pulled his
horse to the sudden stop that was his habit.
They gathered round the back of the cart,
and Mrs. Cleghorn and the small nurse and
the small boy who had been Denny’s advance
agent proceeded to the solemn work of “tast-
ing.”
Denny, in the front of the cart, saw
Bringalily hurrying to shelter, and called to
him: “Come here, Bill,” and Bill returned
as if it were the road to execution.”
“What were you hidin’ for, then?”
“I just—just —come helpin’ with the cab-
bages. I owe you a few quid.”
“When did I shpeak uv it? When did I
shnarl at honest workin’-men, then ? ’Tis
foine cabbages, an’ you want boots, Bringa-
lily Bill. Ye have the naked shole of y’r
fut to the blessed worrld —that left foot.”
Bill grinned, all optimism, and held up
the foot for inspection.
“The sole’s off that foot dead right,” he
said. “But I got a tear in me pants the
other side, and that balances it.”
Then did sixpence a dozen go on to the
price of the cabbages in the mind of Denny
Deneen.
“Get your boots,” said he. “Micky will
’tend ye; an’ you, too, Jimmy, me man.
My, but you’re gettin’ big an’ fine, an’ ’tis
a good showin’ y’ have of the catch-crops.
An’ when you’ve bought your wants, up with
the cabbages. Plenty room’s in the cart, bein’
near sould out. Here, ye two! While
they’re shoppin’ ye kin lift up two bags
here.”
Cleghorn almost wailed; Uncle refused.
“Me with me poisoned foot?” said Uncle.
“Ah, sorrer to y’ur poisoned fut! If you
was poisoned all over ’twouldn’t be much
gnashin’ o’ teeth to anybody. Lave it, then,
lave it for the real men, whin they’re fin-
ished buyin’ av Micky. Mrs. Cleghorn an’
Milly an’ the childer will want something,
Micky. Serve them quick, the day is goin’.
Dear! Dear! ’Tis grreat farrmin’ here,
and a pretty sight them lads have made iu
the wildherness.”
“We heard tiler’s a lunatic escaped. It’s
in the paper,” said Cleghorn, changing the
subject.
“ ’Tain’t like farmin’ in Inglan’,” said
that sturdy beggar, Uncle, unwilling that his
dignity should bow to Denny’s blow.
It was in that moment that Micky, having
supplied his customers, cleared up the cart
to receive 1000 cabbages in bags, and called
Bill from Bringalily to deliver. Bill and
Jimmy carried the bags, and Micky kept
pace stowing them. Then Denny was struck
by an idea that amused him greatly, so that
he put his black beard into bi.s mouth and
laughed.
“Come you here, Bill,” he said. Not
Jimmy—-Bill. See you here, Bill. Whisht
a bit, here be the horse. The poisoned-fut
Uncle have heard of a lunatic escapin’.
Micky have a mask of a madman here. Put
it on you, and slmeak on them blind mice,
and see how they run.”
Introduced to the plot, Micky gave the
mask to Bill of Bringalily, pledged him to
be careful of it, and helped Jimmy to load
the last of the cabbage consignment.
A shabby, bush-stained Australian, with
the sole of one boot gone and a rent in his
trousers on the other side to balance it,
disappeared around the western corner of
the house and reappeared at its eastern side
as a bent old man with goggle eyes, a white
face, red nose and long- grey beard, and
dressed from the waist downwards in a
woman’s skirt and above it in a tat-
tered shirt and a bright red comforter.
He was too good an. actor to he precipitate.
He walked quietly to the end of the veran-
dah, and stood there and waited for dis-
covery.
Uncle made the discovery, and shrieked.
Then discarding crutch and stick, he leaped
from the end of the Verandah and ran west-
wards to the bush, Cleghorn, looking up at
that shriek, saw the frightful face, and fol-
lowed Uncle; and Bringalily Bill uttered a
wild shriek and pursued them. They fled
into the horse-paddock, and the startled horse
and cow raced round the enclosure, as Uncle
fell through the further rails and disappeared
in the . bush. Cleghorn would not even save
his life at the cost of movement. He stopped
in the horse-paddock, and almost died of fear
as Bringalily Bill passed him on the track
of Uncle and disappeared also.
“ ’Twas a great joke, Micky,” said Denny
as the hairy-footed horse ran down the hills
and up the hills homeward and westward.
“I hope Bill has chased him so far he can’t
get back to ate the' childer’s bread. Oh,
Mike, did you see him t’row away hi? crutch
an’ forget his poisoned fut and shake his
legs goin’ t’ro’ the horse-paddock, did ye?
Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! An’ ’twould take a
thrain to catch him ; an’ his little white whis-
kers flyin’ behind him like feu-hers out of a
Leghorn chook fusshed by a dog. An’' him
goin’ like that to save his wort’less life.
Mercy on us, Micky, what’s that?”
The black horse had stopped dead, and
now trembled at the approach of a dis-
hevelled figure that staggered to the cart
gasping : “Murder ! Police !”
“It’s the poisoned-fut bloke, Mister
Deneen.”
“So it is,” said Denny pleasantly. “Did
you have a nice walk, ‘Bishop’?”
“I near killed meself.” stuttered Uncle.
“My Gord, that’s terrible, havin’ loonatics
cornin’ into a peaceful ’ome.”
“Ye’d better go back, or the sun will be
down. ’Tis near t’ree mile, an’ ’tis no plea-
sure meetin’ a blagyard of a crazy man in
the dark.”
Uncle shuddered. “I won’t go back there,”
he said. “A man might get hesself mur-
dered an’ nobody the wiser except hesself.”
“And where will you go, then?”
“Gimme a lift, Mister Deneen. I’ll go to
the township.”
“Your mouth is full of ‘gimme,’ isn’t it,
then? What’ll you do there?”
“I’ll go to the ’orspittle.”
“They’re full, then. You’ll have to go to
work.”
“I’ll try the ’orspittle first. Gimme a
lift. Mister Deneem —a man could get he’s
throat cut here without knowin’ it.”
“Climb you up, then—climb you up.
There’s no more childer’s bread for you,
‘Bishop’—’tis work you’ll be doin’, then.”
The liairy-footed horse got his pace again
as Uncle groaned at the prospect of work
ahead, barely discounting the prospect of
murder behind.
