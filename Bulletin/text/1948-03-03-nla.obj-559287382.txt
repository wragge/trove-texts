ON ITS TRAVELS BRITAIN'S CORONATION STOME RESTED AT DUNSTAFFNAGE CASTLE
npHE grey walls of Dunstaffnage Castle were standing when
Bruce removed the Macdougalls, because it is known that he
gave this stronghold to the loyal Campbells. And so, its thirteenth-
century origin established, Dunstaffnage Castle remains one of
Scotland’s best preserved buildings of that period. The castle stands
upon a promontory at the mouth of Loch Etive, overlooking the
Firth of Lorn, the Island of Mull, Loch Linnhe, Lismore and Loch
Nell. Nine feet thick and sixty-eight feet high, the walls of Dun-
staffnage enclose a number of buildings, some new, some very old,
and a court of some eighty feet square. Upon the battlements there
,were, until recent times, three brass cannon recovered from the
wreck of a galleon, one of the ill-fated Armada, sunk in nearby
Tobermory Bay. According to an old tradition, the original Scots
were descendants of the Egyptian princess Scota, and it is related
that they brought with them, on their centuries of migration, the
stone upon which Jacob slept at Bethel. This stone came via
Ireland and the Island of lona to Dunstaffnage Castle, where it
remained for many royal ceremonials until it made its way to
Scone Abbey. Later Edward I took it to Westminster Abbey,
where it was finally fitted into that oaken chair upon which all but
one of England’s and Britain’s sovereigns have received their
coronation.

"THE HARP IN THE SOUTH."
When Ruth Park’s The Harp in the
South (Angus and Robertson), having
won £2OOO in “S. M. Herald’s” novel
competition, was published in that news-
paper as a serial it shocked and startled
many readers, who wrote irate letters to
the editor. Some of these people, no
doubt, were merely indignant at the idea
of an author’s receiving £2000; others,
presumably unacquainted with Rabelais,
were outraged because the novel men-
tioned spme of what are known as “the
facts of life.”
Since the novel was thus attacked, it
would be pleasant to defend it: which,
as far as the moral question goes, may
be done without hesitation. By compari-
son with, say, Shakspeare—Eric Part-
ridge’s Shakspeare’s Bawdy, recently re-
viewed on this page, should be studied
on this point—Ruth Park’s excursions
into what the dust-jacket optimistically
calls “uncompromising realism” are so
mild that they hardly call for comment.
They are mild by comparison with
current standards in England and
America.
Perhaps the book’s most “shocking”
chapter is the description of the heroine’s
visit to an abortionist. This, certainly, is
an unpleasant subject, but surely a legiti-
mate theme for discussion. One does
not eliminate a social evil by shutting
one’s eyes to its existence, and, from a
social point of view, the author is rather
to be congratulated than condemned for
her courage. Her outlook is socially im-
peccable ; so much so, indeed, that the
resultant sentimentality and propaganda
considerably reduce the literary value of
that chapter and of subsequent references
to it.
To accuse the author of pornography
here would be fantastic. Nor can it be
said that, taken as a whole, the novel
“dwells” on the sordid. In fact, it basks
in a glow of Dickensian sentiment—fre-
quently degenerating into an equally
Dickensian sentimentality, but without
anything approaching Dickens’s power
and exuberance of characterisation —and
its final effect is of artlessness and inno-
cence. Except for a few isolated attempts
to handle the extremes of human experi-
ence —one memorable picture of bed-
bugs, a seduction, one scene of sadism
and one of flagellation, the abortion chap-
ter and the strained and mechanical in-
cident where the heroine is kicked by
Dutch sailors (why Dutch?) — The Harp
in the South is the simple story of a girl’s
love and marriage, essentially the same
as a thousand romances that are pub-
lished in women’s magazines.
The notion that it is a “shocking”
novel probably arose from the fact that
Ruth Park puts, so to speak, all her cards
on the table in the first chapter. Here
we have this sort of landscape;
Downstairs there was a dark bedroom
without window or skylight, a kitchen with
a broken floor, and a scullery with one
window overlooking the little flagged yard,
where a drunken garbage-can stood with
its lid over one ear.
And hard by the drunken garbage-can
we have characters also with their lids
also over one ear; the story of the child
Thady (a pointless sub-plot in the novel)
who has been kidnapped from the
Darcy home in Sydney’s Surry Hills and
probably murdered ; the drunken father
of the family, Hughie; the occupants of
the Darcys’ furnished rooms, an in-
temperate Orangeman who had been
christened Patrick by “a gin-bemused
neighbor,” and the spinster Miss Sheily,
who is seen flogging her* half-witted ille-
gitimate son with a length of knotted
electric flex. And here we have the cele-
brated bedbugs, “haunting the tormented
sleep of the poor”:
As the darkness grew deeper the bugs
came out of their cracks in the walls,
from under the paper, and out of the
cavities in the old iron bedsteads, where
uiey hung by day in grape-like clusters.
Iney were thin and flat and starved, but
before dawn they would return to their
foul hiding places round and glistening and
bloated. Captain Phillip brought them in
the rotten timbers of his First Fleet, and
ever since they have remained in the oid
tenement houses of Sydney, ferocious, in-
eradicable, the haunters of the tormented
sleep of the poor.
But those who fainted at this first chap-
ter failed to realise that, for the most part
of the book, Ruth Park plays quite a
different set of cards. We learn that
Hughie is not always drunk and that on
the whole his family life is happy—“l
was thinking, of how lucky we are,”
whispers Mumma at the end of the novel.
We learn that Miss Sheily is sought in
love and matrimony by an amiable, if
demented, Swedish gentleman. We learn
that even the bedbugs can be checked, if
not defeated, by treatment with kerosene.
And we suspect, though the point is not
mentioned, that the garbage-can some-
times has its lid firmly over both ears.
Tragedy gives place to light comedy, a
novel that begins in the manner of Zola
or Dostoievsky weighs, in the final
analysis, only a little heavier than the
“Bindle” books of Herbert Jenkins.
Surely, then, from the moral or socio-
logical viewpoint, it should be possible
to read The Harp in the South without
turning cartwheels. It is an extremely,
indeed excessively, moral book, and it has
a happy ending.
From the literary viewpoint, however,
a» defence of the novel is not so easy to
undertake. It is a confused, disjointed,
sentimental work, altogether lacking in
the dynamic force of plot and character-
isation necessary to hold the reader’s in-
terest. Its central theme, insofar as a
theme can be detected, is the love-life of
the heroine Rowena—a stock pattern for
the novel in which, nine times out of
ten, it is very difficult to take more than
the mildest interest. It never really seems
to matter, even in Scott or Dickens,
whether the tepid young lady marries the
personable young man or not. And she
invariably does. Rowena, as a central
figure, is not more than normally unin-
teresting, but for a great part of the novel
shells incapacitated by sickness: a cir-
cumstance conceivably pathetic but ob-
viously lacking in the possibilities of
dramatic movement.
One is left, then, as again is often the
case with Scott and Dickens, to look to
the minor characters for life and interest.
Here, up to a point. The Harp in the
South succeeds: particularly in the figure
of a grandmother who smokes a clay
pipe and likes a sup of brandy. But
even with this attractive old harridan the
sentimentality underlying the whole novel
destroys the quality of conviction.
Grandma and Hughie fighting to see
which of them will make the Christmas
pudding are mildly amusing—and not
quite credible.
“Uncompromising realism” is neither
the fault nor the merit of The Harp in
the South: realism is its merit, a com-
promise with realism its fault. There is
no scene , and no character in which this
compromise does not, to a degree, under-
mine the plausibility essential to a work
of art that is not frankly set down as
fantasy. Consider, for instance, the bed-
bugs. The author tells us for a start that
they are “ineradicable” ; then, later, she
shpws how they may be, at least tempor-
arily, eradicated.
Consider that remark “the tormented
sleep of the poor.” Surely, remembering
income-tax and financial worries, ill-
health, family trouble, hot weather and
mosquitoes, one might equally well write
of “the tormented sleep of the rich.”
Consider, again, the complaint made
on behalf of Rowena, “Like all the poor
she had nowhere} to be private except in
the lavatory, and even that had no lock
on the door, so she could not be sure of
being uninterrupted.” Locks, after all,
are not very expensive.
Consider, once more, the case of Miss
Sheily. In the opening chapter she is
shown beating her half-witted son with
the electric flex —the boy with hisi hands
bound, the whole scene a picture of
sadistic fury. Then, later, after the boy
has been run over and killed in the street,
Miss Sheily is shown lashing herself with
some kind of implement of torture. One
would need to be an expert in morbid
psychology to declare with certainty that
it would be impossible for Miss Sheily
so radically to alter the nature of her
perversion, but the development does not
seem probable, nor is the explanation of
“remorse,” given and apparently credited
by the author, acceptable. Miss Sheily
is certainly the victim of some kind of
sexual maladjustment, and, whatever may
be believed about the course of her
disease, it is quite impossible to credit
her marriage to the devoted Swede at
the end. The author herself is clearly
uneasy at this concession to the pleasures
of a happy ending, and, in too facile an
apology, declares that the lover is a
“masochist”: a very superficial use of
Freudian terminology.
Consider, lastly, the fact that, when
tempted into buying some finery at the
Markets, Rowena is shown, in what is
presumably a scene of pathos, spending
five shillings needed to buy vegetables
for the family; and yet, a little later on,
she is stated to have thirty shillings “in
the old, powder-box where she kept her
savings” ; and a few chapters further on,
when she urgently needs money, she is
able in a very short space of time to earn
£lO in overtime at the factory where she
works. With two lodgers paying rent, and
two members of the family working, the
Darcys’ extreme poverty would take a
deal of proving.
Instances of these inconsistencies could
be multiplied, for they occur everywhere,
but the examples given should be enough
to indicate that the novel is unstable,
both as a drama of character and as a
sociological document on Surry Hills, In-
experience in the craft of the novel—a
measured development towards drama
was hardly possible after the high pitch
of intensity reached in the opening
chapter—aqd the tendency to look
sympathetically at “the poor” as a class
instead of regarding them detachedly as
individuals are the basic • causes of the
novel’s weakness. Rowena’s marriage to
a young man with aboriginal blood in
him is an obvious piece of sentimental
propaganda.
Something, of course, remains after the
faults have been recognised: touches of
comedy, moments of drama, glimpses of
characterisation, a general impression
that this is, though superficially, some-
thing like the life of a Sydney slum ; and,
chiefly, a certain emotional warmth. The
Harp in the South is, after all, a first
novel, and any first novel with these
qualities may be regarded as promising.
But some of Ruth Park’s short stories
which have found publication have been
more than promising: in a minor way,
and usually with an inclination towards
morbid themes, genuine pieces of artistry.
It would almost sesm that The Harp in
the South began as one of these studies
in morbidity, natural to a young writer,
and that, somewhere during the course
of it, there was a change of purpose.
Miss Sheily, properly understood and
fully developed, might have been ex-
tremely shocking to readers of newspaper
serials, but she would have been much
more interesting than Rowena, Hughie
or Mumma.
VARIOUS VERSE.
Summer Night.
The people of the house are all awake
This hot, still night. You can hear the floor-
boards creak
Where a shadow crosses the moonlight—one
goes to slake
Parched lips with cold, clear water; and some-
where a bed
Groans, where another turns, restless, vainly
desiring
Some patch of pillow less fevered than his cheek
And is still again, blood pounding in his head.
They murmur, “Are awake?”.. .“Not a
breath of air”...
“The moon’s too bright”.. .“Why hasn’t the
southerly come?”
And in the end, despairing of sleep, they seek
The' flagged verandah, dark-patterned with vine-
leaves, and there
Sit or lean about, clinking glasses, talking
together,
Remembering—and before they know, they will
say
Too much: how the night lures them out, the
foolish words
That know better than to stir from their holes
by day!
And over the rise, where the stones of the old
graveyard
Founder in milky grass-waves, lurching or lying,
They’ll be out of their beds, too, talking the
night away
(Baked earth is a stifling blanket, and none too
light),
Tracing rain-blackened names by the moonlight,
and times of dying.
And men who knew all the good stories in their
day.
Propped against broken column or rusting rail,
Will be telling them, generation to generation —
Drought, robbery under arms, flood, storm, and
fight —
And lovers walk, whispering like the stir of air
In dry paddocks (O blowing grasses, long and
pale,
White road and silver fences, O cloud-dark
hair I
O beauty, beauty, brief as the summer night I).
And women sit resting their backs on the leaning
stones,
Speaking softly, each with her baby on her knee
Asleep, or with dark, unwinking eyes on the
moon
Dr his mother’s face, bent in tranquillity.
[Not in the heart’s seasons can they return,
The cruel summers that took the little ones,
Nor those calm fields their fires of anguish
burn
Where death’s sweet frosts lie white eternally.)
And the later the hour, the deeper will memory
flow
Till they bob to the surface at last, those
grinning secrets
Sunk six feet deep for Doomsday so long ago.
In the faint chill before the dawn they will sleep,
People of the graves and people of the house,
but the first
Are luckier, for they need not awake to the
glare
Of the long hot day's beginning, with all their
thirst
For rest unquenched, nor under gritty eyelids
Watch each other with rancor and shame, for
sores laid bare
Only Jordan’s stream should have touched, for
secrets told
That should have been kept till the mouth was
stopped with mould.

Creek Boy and Girl with Rifles.
Against the vivid drop of sky
See where this sullen couple stand,
The tiger lashed within his eye,
The orchard crushed within her hand.
Here on this dusty road in Greece
The snipers’ summer-lightning gleams
And each man greets his brother’s face
Each time he slides the bolt and aims
Or wounds the one for whom he burns,
The darling of his mind and lust;
And voices plead within the loins
And cry a warning from the dust.
O you who stand above the plain
And wear a clouded human face
Are counters in a dead man’s brain
Or guardians of a foreign peace;
But stand as you have ever stood,
Aggressor and victim of all wars;
And evening glistens with your blood
And streams are turbulent with your tears.

Fall of Satan.
How real I was of old
In the dark and the twilight ages
What awesome tales were told
Of me, the hero, by the crones and rustic sages !
Is there a cleft in the downs?
A grisly hollow in the field ?
A sinister crag that frowns
Above the green level?
A heap of unrelated stones?
A valley deep, mysteriously sealed.
Where no stream visibly flows?
“Why, then,’’ say the sages and the crones,
“The Devil did it.”
Does one find an ancient hoard
In tumulus stored?
I, the Devil, hid it.
When a rampart was to build,
A chasm to be filled,
In my rage I champed,
Foiled in my resolve, I stamped.
Split the earth asunder,
In the hills made the gap,
Spilt the stones from my lap
With a crash like thunder...
How great has been my fall I
I have had my day,
For now they say
“It’s the devil and all,”
“What the devil do you mean?”
“Where the devil can it be?”
“Where the devil have you been?”
“What the devil is that squeaking?”
So now, you see,
I’m just a manner of speaking.

ARNOLD WALL.
A Herd of Bunyips.
It is a regrettable fact that, while
bunyips continue to be seen and heard
by the most reputable hatters of the out-
back, nobody has ever been bitten by one.
A certain flavor of conviction in some
of the notes collected by Charles Barrett
in The Bunyip (Reed and Harris) is, con-
sequently, welcome. One lucky man, it
appears, saw a whole herd of bunyips
cavorting in the Murrumbidgee River.
The place, of course, was Gundagai.
This remarkable sight was observed in
1850. The observer was E. J. Dunn, later
a Director of the Geological Survey of
Victoria and a world authority on pebbles
and gold—surely a reliable witness. And
this, as Charles Barrett quotes him, is
what Mr. Dunn saw:
While camped we heard a strange “moo-
ing” sound, something like the lowing of
a calf, in the river, made by many in-
dividuals. We were all astonished, and went
hurriedly to the river brink to see what
made the noise. To our surprise there
was a herd of animals swimming in the
middle of the stream, and making good
progress upstream against a swift current.
One of the party had a shotgun, which he
loaded and discharged at them two or three
times before they had all passed.
We boys ran and got lines and fish-hooks,
which we baited with meat and cast towards
the strange animals in the vain hope of
catching one. Although making good
headway against the stream the herd took
some little time to pass, as there were many
of them. My recollection of these animals
is that they had round heads, with no
visible ears, but eyes that could be seen,
dark-colored fur, length of animals about
five feet; while swimming the head and top
of the back were exposed above the water.
Mr. Dunn’s theory was that the
bunyips were seals. They had come,
he believed, some 2000 miles up the
Murray and the Murrumbidgee from the
sea ; steamboats and increased settlement,
frightening the seals from their old
haunts, provide the reasons why the
bunyip, with all due respect to the recent
specimen, is no longer seen at Gundagai.
In confirmation of this theory, with
which ha appears to concur, Mr. Barrett
gives an instance of a “leopard seal,”
10ft. in length, being taken in the Shoal-
haven River in 1870 —“and its stomach
contained a full-grown platypus, proving
that this ocean-going mammal had
travelled some distance upstream into
fresh water.”
The seal theory also seems to fit a
number of Tasmanian bunyips, and. would
also perhaps account for the “bunyip’s
skull” found by natives on the banks of
the Murrumbidgee in 1846, an object
which one authority declared, with learn-
ing and scorn, to be the skull of a foal,
and which another authority declared,
with equal learning and ferocity, to b £
the skull of a calf.
Interesting for such information, Tne
Bunyip is nevertheless by no means Bar-
rett at his best. It gives the impression
of raw material hastily and careless!}
assembled and much of it—the digressions
concerning rock-carvings and the Rain-
bow Serpent —is repeated from tne
author’s previous works. It would have
been much better if the book had been
expanded in the way suggested _by the
chapter on the alleged Great Barrier Reel
Sea-serpent.

This curious-looking contrivance helps to pro-

It stretches, twists and strains strips of sidewall
rubber and gives them the same constant flexing
and produces the same fatigue they would get in
a tyre on your car. The machine is even located
on the roof, wide open to the elements, for weather,
too, is tough on sidewalls.
By tests of strips of Goodyear and other tyres,
this machine continuously demonstrates that Good-

From what are the surnames of
the Royal family derived? Specifi-
cally, why is present Royalty
“Windsor” ? Will the Ro'yal surname
be affected by Princess Elizabeth’s
marriage to Philip on her accession
to the throne?
The surname of the House of
Hanover —George I to Victoria —was
Guelph. Edward VII took the sur-
name of his father Prince Albert,
which was Wettin, and styled his
dynasty the House of Saxe-Coburg.
During World War I George V changed
the Wettin to Windsor, adopting that
also as the name of the House. As
to lire future, there is only one
precedent, that of Victoria, since no
other Queen Regnant left issue. If
.hat is followed Princess Elizabeth’s
children would take the surname
Mountbatten.

What is the derivation of the abbre-
viation “Cantab”2
Both Webster’s and the New
Oxford Dictionaries give “Cantab”
as a colloquial abbreviation of
Cantabrigian, which derives from
Cantabrigia, the Latin form of Cam-
bridge. Collins’s Authors’ and Printers’
Dictionary, however, makes a finer
distinction, giving Cantabrigian as
meaning “of Cambridge,” and Can-
tabrigiensis as “of Cambridge Uni-
versity.” “Cantab.,” it states, is an
abbreviation of the latter.

Are aluminium cooking utensils
injurious to health ?
A leading authority, Dr. J. H.
Shelton, M.D. (Lond.), says: “On
an average human diet the intake of
aluminium is somewhere about 12mg.
per days, of which about one-half at
least comes from food and not from
cooking utensils. We have no know-
ledge of whether it is an essential
element for the tissues or whether it
is merely taken up passively. In any
case, ih the amounts absorbed from
an ordinary diet it appears that it
does no harm, and there need be no
fear of toxic effects from utensils.”

What boxer holds record of quick-

who holds record for world’s Quickest
knockout?
Quickest knockout in Australia is
thought to be when A 1 Walker (Syd-
ney) knocked out Jackie Burns (New-
castle) with first punch at Sydney
Stadium on July 22, 1940. No time
check was made of the Walker-Burns
knockout, but it was probably as
quick as, or quicker than, A 1 Fore-
man’s knockout of Ruby Levine at
Montreal on April 25, 1928. Fore-
man finished Levine in 11£ seconds
(including count), and this still stands
on record as the world’s quickest

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
FRUITS OF AN “ACHIEVEMENT.”
So far Dr, Evatt has ex-
pressed no second thoughts re-
garding the Palestine partition
“achievement,” as he called it
op his return from U.N.O. The
plain truth is that the “achieve-
ment” is a confused mess; in-
stead of any contribution to
peace, it has made Palestine cme
of the worst of the danger spots
which threaten peace.
The whole fault is U.N.O.’s,
both by commission and omis-
sion ; the tragic outcome of
hasty bungling by amateur dip-
lomats and limelighters. As
grim milestones of their bungle,
one killing every 90 minutes
ever since, the rate increased by
such wholesale killings as hap-
pened in last week’s dynamite
outrage in Jerusalem —over 50
dead and 60-odd in hospital—
and its aftermath of hysterical
revenge - killings of innocent
British soldiers and civilians.
And all this now admitted by
everybody to be merely a fore-
taste of what must be expected
when Britain has succeeded in
pulling out, leaving the thank-
less job and its future death-roll
to those who have asked for
them.
How the U.N.O. novices acted
in the face of warnings and ad-
vice from Britain —by far the
shrewdest and most experienced
member of the outfit, in foreign
dealings generally and the
Palestine problem in particular
—has been well stated by Lon-
don “Times”:
All through the discussions in the
Palestine Committee and the General
Assembly British representatives re-
peatedly pointed to the risk of taking
a decision in favor of partition with-
out at the same time providing the
means to make it effective. These warn-
ings were ignored, partly because of
the hope that the British Government,
in spite of their repeated declarations,
could be persuaded to use the admini-
strative and military machinery of the
mandatory Government to impose
partition by force, and partly because
the representatives of the Jewish
Agency dismissed the danger of Arab
resistance as a figment of the British
imagination, stoutly maintaining that
Hagana could cope with any emer-
gency. Now it has become clear that
the structure of public security in
Palestine is breaking down even more
quickly than Britain had expected, the
Jewish Agency is profoundly per-
turbed.
Not only the Jewish Agency
is perturbed. The U.N.O. parti-
tion commission, the United
States, non-Zionist Jews and
various others are most per-
turbed. In all these quarters
fears are being expressed at wide
variance with the “achieve-
ment” of Dr. Evatt’s diagnosis.
The commission of “five
little nations,” appointed to en-
force the partition, took one
look at the thing and came up
howling for the enforcement
troops the Assembly did not
provide. The commission • told
the Security Council that “it
could not maintain law and
order and implement partition
without adequate military
forces.” They, and others with
them, realise at last what the
amateur “achievement” involves.
“By this time,” one speaker
declared at a recent meeting of
the American Council of Juda-
ism, “it seems to me that even
the most optimistic Zionist
should begin to suspect that the
sort of division drawn in the
United Nations report will never
be carried through; that the
Zionist State, with its Arab
population of more than 40 per
cent., will never be established
without a long, bloody, ruthless
civil war. And if American boys
are shot down as they try to
guard those lonely roads or
storm Arab sniper nests, if that
happens then I foresee the most
rapid spread of anti-Jewish feel-
ing across this country that the
United States has ever known.”
Another speaker at the same
meeting warned that “if the
fight to create a Jewish State in
Palestine should eventually cost
the democratic Powers the
Middle East oil, then Jews in
the United States and in other
countries will pay dearly, along
with their fellow-citizens.”
This is a far cry from the
vicious hate-Britain propaganda
which preceded the U.N.O. par-
tition vote. And just as that
propaganda appeared to be re-
flected ip the official U.S. spon-
sorship of partition, so the
second-thought fears are now re-
flected in the same quarter. The
authoritative “U.S. News-World
Report” (the former two publi-
cations being now merged) de-
clares that “U.S. support for
dividing Palestine is regarded in
British circles, and increasingly
among American officials, as a
major error in U.S. foreign
policy.” It further comments
that “the mess in Palestine
worries Americans most of all”
— i.e., more than the trouble in
Greece or any of the other
involvements thereabouts. “It
could cost the U.S. its whole
stake, present and future, in the
Middle East”:
Arab hostility to Americans now
will take years to change. Middle
East oil, meanwhile, is in jeopardy.
So is Moslem friendship everywhere,
including India.
Proposed solution enforcing
Palestine partition by international
police force—makes Arabs madder,
is full of trouble for the U.S. at best.
Thought of U.S. troops policing
Bagdad, for instance, is hard to take.
So is the notion of a joint Soviet-
American force. Even more alarm-
ing, to some, is the possibility that
Russia might let U.S. do the policing,
and reap the harvest.
The same publication has
aired a view which, while it
must seem rank heresy to
trumpeters of the partition
“achievement,” has lately been
heard with ominous frequency.
It flatly states that “the solution
favored by more ‘and more
American officials, though not
publicly admitted, is to give up
the whole idea of partitioning
Palestine,”
Also reviewing the dilemma
Uncle Sam has got himself into
on this issue, “Christian Science
Monitor” correspondent Joseph
C. Harsch reports his inquiries
as discovering “that there is very
great perplexity in higher Wash-
ington military quarters about
what United States action is in
order in the Palestine troubles”:
The idea of a United Nations
police force for Palestine to be re-
cruited from the Great Powers
rouses considerable uneasiness here
[Washington] since it would be dif-
ficult, if not impossible, to exclude
Russia from a share in that police
force. And if Russia were once per-
mitted a military toehold in Pales-
tine, it would presumably involve the
granting to Russia of “line-of-com-
munication” rights similar to those
Russia now enjoys in Hungary and
Rumania as support for her occu-
pation troops in Austria. Washing-
ton wants no Russian line of com-
munication established across the
Middle East to Palestine, paralleling,
perhaps, the oil supply-lines of that
area.
“U.S. News-World Report”
states that already “Arab resist-
ance has stopped work on one
pipeline in the Middle East,” a
pipeline being constructed by
American oil companies. Quite
evidently this and the more
violent Arab resistance are a
severe shock to U.S. and U.N.O.
optimism. The actual Arab
moves, a N.Y. “Times” corre-
spondent has reported from
Damascus, “refute the specula-
tion current at the time of par-
tition that the Arabs would con-/
tent themselves with speeches
and resolutions and would not
fi g h t.” The correspondent
added; —
Most observers here think that if
troops representing the United Nations
or any of its members should be sent
into Palestine to enforce partition,
or if the Security Council should
condemn any of the Arab States for
endangering the peace, the effect
would be to incite and unite the
Arabs to more fanatical efforts. In
either case the United States, which
is already the bete noire of partition,
would be held responsible.
Last month the Arab Higher
Committee of Palestine sent to
U.N.O. what a N.Y, “Times”
correspondent at Lake Success
described as “a formal declara-
tion of war.” The committee
declared in its letter to the
U.N.O. secretary-general that
the Arabs would fight “to the
last man” against “any force
going to Palestine to partition
the country.”
Britain’s tough enough job in
Palestine is not merely changing
hands: the job itself has been
changed. Controlling the man-
date was one thing; enforcing
partition against a violently
hostile Arab opposition is some-
thing entirely different.
De Gaulle Aims.
On the theme of what kind
of leader of France General de
Gaulle would be, Scripps-
Howard foreign editor William
Philip Simms quotes an inter-
view with a leader of De
Gaulle’s Rally movement, Gil-
bert Remy, insisting that the
General, far from being a totali-
tarian with dictator ambitions,
holds that there must always be
more than one party; that the
party in power must have oppo-
sition.
Nothing could be further from
De Gaulle’s mind, Remy de-
clared, than staging a coup
d’etat and seizing power by
force, De Gaulle, in fact,
“would not accept power unless
he knew he had a majority of
the country behind him.” De
Gaulle supporters expect that
majority will appear overwhelm-
ingly in the coming elections.
Given such majority support,
Remy admits that De Gaulle
would be “a hard taskmaster”
who would make “British aus-
terity look almost like extrava-
gance.” He “would demand the
utmost sacrifice from every
citizen. From all workers
everywhere he would ask for an
extra stint, something more than
the ordinary day’s work.”
A condition not exactly pecu-
liar to France is that “one out
of every five Frenchmen is on
the Government payroll, and it
would seem that the job of the
one is to keep the other four
from working.” Under De
Gaulle there would be a lot of
sackings in that quarter.
“The General,” Remy said,
“believes in the free-enterprise
system, which he would gradu-
ally restore to France. Some of
the enterprises which have been
nationalised would be returned
to private ownership.”
As for the Communist party,
“The General would dissolve it
as being a State within a State,
and as such inconsistent and in-
tolerable in a free country.”
Franco in Favor.
Some 18 months back there
was a typical U.N.O. action on
Spain—typical U.N.O. action
being the passing of resolutions
which members either ignore or
sabotage.
The “action” on Spain called
on members to withdraw the
heads of their diplomatic mis-
sions in that country. Britain
complied; the old Lion has be-
come wonderfully accommodat-
ing in recent years. Other coun-
tries either ignored the U.N.O.
direction or pretended their
diplomatic missions didn’t have
heads. One of those South
American countries read the
direction upside down. It
promptly appointed a diplomatic
head in Spain!
At the General Assembly
session towards the end of last
year Spain again came up for
“action.” This time the direc-
tion on the withdrawal of diplo-
matic heads failed to get the re-
quired two-thirds vote and was
deleted.
Meanwhile, a measure of
“achievement” of sorts attached
to the U.N.O. “action.” It
greatly strengthened Franco’s
own position in Spain.
Now, as reported by “U.S.
News-World Report,” the big
Powers are “warming up to
Franco.” He is “getting along
better with the United States and
the Governments of Western
Europe,” the U.S. Government
“clearing the way for the
Generalissimo to get more U.S.
dollars” and the French (among
others), after two years of try-
ing to root him out, now “seek-
ing to do business with him.”
Franco, in fact, “is being treated
as a friend by Governments that
sought his overthrow.” There
is a possibility for the future
that “Franco Spain will be wel-
comed into the Marshall Plan
for the reconstruction of
Europe” ; the 16 countries co-
operating in the Plan “agreed to
keep Spain out at the start, but
since that time things have
changed.”
Apart from the factor of
economics, which has a way of
overriding ideology wherever
they clash, Spain “is of growing
strategic importance” to both
sides in the “cold war.” The
strategic importance to the U.S.
as a main combatant in any
shooting war is obvious. Spain
is looked on as a possible base
for land or air power, and, the
U.S. having practically taken
over the Mediterranean as a
centre of sea power, “military
strategists in Washington are
urging that the U.S. be more
friendly with Franco” in order
“to protect the U.S, stake in the
inland sea.”
Regarding air power, “U.S.
News-World Report” gives a re-
markable piece of information,
tending to make the U.N.O.
futilities all the more ludicrous.
“It is not generally known,” it
states, “that the U.S. still has a
stake in Spain’s airfields.” That
certainly has not been generally
known. It appears that, under
an agreement with Franco, “if
U.S troops had to be rushed to
Europe tomorrow they could
land on Spanish airfields,” which
airfields, it is also specially in-
teresting to learn, have been
“developed and equipped by
Americans for American
planes”!
That came about when, at the
end of the World War, Franco
gave the US. the right to fly
troops over Spain and land them
in Spain on the way to and from
the occupation areas; U.S. in
turn developing and equipping
the airfields.
The same source is authority
for the information that Ameri-
can diplomats in Madrid have
been negotiating an agreement
that will allow Franco to secure
U.S. dollars with some of Spain’s
gold holdings and thereby be
able to buy raw materials and
machinery from the U.S.
Pacifist Americans.
Soviet anti-American propa-
ganda—which, with the ever-
ready Com. fifth-column planted
in all countries, wakes an in-
stant chorus all over the world
—harps persistently on the theme
of a bellicose and imperialist
United States.
In a London “Fortnightly”
article Sir Harold Butler insists
that nothing could be further
from the truth. It is only very
recently that Americans kept
themselves aloof from the world
in pacifist isolation, and “nations
do not change like that” over-
night :
Anyone who wanders about in the
drug-stores and motor-camps of
America will find the people just as
pacifist at heart as they were in the
’twenties or ’thirties. But they have
seen and learnt much in the interval.
Millions of them have fought all
over the globe. They have demon-
strated American power not only to
the world at large, but most of all
to themselves. Now they know that
they cannot avoid being the greatest
Power and that as such they cannot
avoid the consequent responsibilities.
That has been a chastening reflection.
Instead of an outburst of jingo pride
in the “American century,” the im-
mense achievements of the United
States’ forces provoked heart-search-
ing and misgiving. The last thing
the ordinary man and woman wanted
was to give their money and their
sons to preserving a Pax Americana
in the world. To suppose that they
were bamboozled into imperialism by
the “capitalist” press or that the vast
majority of American businessmen
were'interested in anything but mak-
ing and selling things in their vast
home market are notions which can
only thrive as long as the outside
world remains as ignorant of the
American way of life as it generally
is.
Yet these same inherently
pacifist Americans “are solidly
behind Mr. Truman and Mr.
Marshall” in their moves to
block Soviet expansion. Why?
Well, for one thing, the writer
explains, Americans hoped for
a real peace based on a thorough
understanding with Britain and
the U.S.S.R. and fortified by a
strong and effective United
Nations. Knowing that that has
fallen by the way, and why,
Americans ruefully accept the
enforced role of assisting in
European recovery. And,
further: —-
The Atlantic Charter was the ex-
pression of the principles for which
Americans had fought and on which
alone they believed that peace could
be securely founded. When those
principles were openly flouted and
derided by the Russian leaders, not
merely on the Moscow radio, but
actually from the United Nations
platform in New York, when instead
of free elections and the spread of
personal liberty Americans saw
minority parties seizing power by
force and maintaining it by judicial
murder and police inquisition through-
out Eastern Europe, the old American
hatred of tyranny stiffened their reso-
lution to oppose the expansion of
Russian power.
Dragnet Digest.
Siberia for Zionists. —For reasons
of its own, which should have been
at once plain to the most nitwitted of
wishful thinkers, Russia supported the
Zionists in their Palestine-partition
aims. The real Soviet feeling for
Zionists has been pointed out by
Rabbi Meyer Berlin, of Jerusalem,
world president of the religious wing
of the Zionist Organisation. Inter-
viewed by a N. Y. “World-Telegram”
man, Rabbi Berlin stated that “thou-
sands of Jews have been sent to
Siberia for Zionist activities in the
Soviet Union.” In fact, the Rabbi
added, “Russia and her satellites are
the only nations in the world today
that ban Zionism.”

The Com. Fifth Column. —“There
have been a good many American
radicals and rebels from the time of
the Revolution to the twentieth cen-
tury,” comments William Henry
Chamberlin in “Wall-street Journal."
“America has given them more or
less attention and has taken them
pretty well in its stride. But it has
never been the mark of an American
radical in the past to be slavishly sub-
servient to a foreign Power. That
is the disturbing something new that
that has been added in our nation-
wide assortment of Communist and
Communist-front organisations.” It
holds true for the fifth column every-
where.

The Gold Hoards. —A report of the
U.S. National Advisory Council on
International Monetary and Financial
Problems (a name to match the sort
of figures it deals in) shows Russia
as ranking next to the U.S. in gold
holdings. The Soviet holdings amount
to $2,500,000,000, out of a grand
total of $14,000,000,000 held by all
countries other than the U.S., whose
figure is $22,789,000,000, roughly one-
third more than the rest of the world
combined. Next after Russia are
Britain ($2,360,000,000), then in order
Switzerland, South Africa, France,
Argentina.

Korean Border Clashes. —Seeing in
Korea “the beginnings of possible
civil war and invasion,” a N. Y.
“Journal-American” correspondent
states, on U.S. intelligence-service
information, that “Korean border
clashes are averaging six dead and
50 wounded weekly.” The clashes
occur between North and South
Koreans over land and rice and
water, and between South Korean
police and Russian soldiers who cross
the parallel illegally to “propagandise,
bulldoze and loot.” The correspon-
dent added: “Not only has Russia
bribed and coerced a Korean puppet
army of 200,000 into being, but she
has created a Communist constabu-
lary with most of its members posted
along the parallel to fight with their
fellow-countrymen in the south.” In
all the clashes, regardless of how the
trouble started, the Russians auto-
matically demand indemnities and the
American authorities just as automati-
cally ignore the demands.

British Skill in Demand. —“It is a
tribute to British skill,” as London
“Times’s” aeronautical correspondent
rightly assesses it, “that from all parts
of the world requests are being made
for technical advice and assistance in
establishing and developing national
airlines.” Iraq, Persia, East and West
Africa, Malaya and China are a few
of the places named as profiting by
the policy of making British expert
air knowledge and experience “avail-
able to all who wish to build up a
national airline” and advising on
“choice of aircraft, operating tech-
nique, ground organisation and so on
during the formative period,” after
which, “when they have acquired the
necessary experience, the countries can
employ their own nationals.”

West Trade Flows East. —ln 2
special article on the economic pro-
gress of the U.S.-British combined
zones in Germany, a London “Times
correspondent quotes Allied experts
as believing that, “given the neces-
sary incentives,” German industry i»
capable of meeting the provisions ot
the three-year plan calling for sen-
sufficiency and exports to the value
of s9oom. by 1950. It is noteworthy,
the correspondent adds, that exports
from the West have been delivered
not only to the Soviet Union but
also to Yugoslavia, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, wfip can find no
ready substitute for many products
of the Ruhr. “This consideration
naturally prompts the opinion that
Russia may take no irrevocable action
likely to split East and West.”

LAWSON. KEANE. WARD.
Exactly eight years ago “Labor” was
moved to explosions of outraged virtue
by the affair of J. N. Lawson, then
Minister of Trade and Customs, by which
it profited exceedingly. That “Labor”
should choose to forget its attitude and
the high moral sentiments it professed
on that occasion was only to be ex-
pected, for the words Lowell put in the
mouth of his American character are
applicable to the make-up and practice
of this party:
A marcjful Providence fashioned us holler
O’ purpose thet we might our principles
swaller.
And whenever it is expedient awkward
precedents and recollections, as well
as principles, slide down “Labor’s”
capacious maw. What is remarkable is
that the Opposition has chosen to forget
the Lawson affair, or at least to leave
unwielded the weapon which the Lawson
and Keane and Ward affairs have placed
in its hands.
Lawson was appointed Minister of
Trade and Customs on April 26, 1940,
being 41 at the time. On December 6,
still a ’prentice hand, he steered through
the House a bill for bounty-feeding
motor-engine production which received
united “Labor” support, as it did two
days later in the Senate, where “Labor”-
leader Ceilings said ‘The Opposition re-
joices to see that the Government is mak-
ing this move and gives the bill its bless-
ing.” On December 19 it was announced
that the Government had promised
£1,500,000 in bounties and certain other
concessions to W. J, (“Knockout”)
Smith, of A.C.1., who, for his part, agreed
to manufacture and deliver 60,000
“engine units” without loitering on
the journey. On December 23 a
mare called Billie won a race at
Randwick for “Gordon Rodney.” It
transpired that “Gordon Rodney” was
Lawson, and that he had leased the
animal from Smith after negotiating the
engine contract with that worthy.
The facts of the Billie business were
doubtless communicated to Mr. Curtin
by one of the many “Labor” politicians
who go racing (it would be difficult to
find one that doesn’t), and he made
great play with them in the by-election
campaign for Corio (Vic.), which, thus
influenced, elected Mr. Dedman. Mean-
time a whisper had reached Mr. Menzies,
who said the contract with Smith would
not operate (it never did, a “ ‘Labor’ Gov-
ernment” paying compensation) until
Parliament should decide for or against it.
The Curtin exposure, made on February
12, was followed by a Parliamentary de-
bate during which Mr. Curtin harshly
denounced tfie leasing of the mare as “a
business transaction.” The unfortunate
Lawson protested that it was nothing of
the kind, nothing more than a sporting
arrangement with a “sport” who was
leasing most of his horses prior to going
to the U.S.A.; that it had brought him no
prize-money and had been cancelled
immediately his chief told him it was “a
great blunder.” Though Mr. Menzies
expressed faith in his “integrity” and
“refused to ruin his career,” ruined il
was. On February 23—eight days before
the Corio polling—Lawson perforce
returned his portfolio, and on September
2*3 he lost Macquarie to Mr. Chifley
whom he had unseated in 1931 and de-
feated again in 1934.
Meantime Mr. Ward wouldn’t let the
poor devil alone. Two months after he
had ceased to be a Minister Mr. Ward,
mentioning or imagining “some persistent
rumors that are circulating in Sydney,”
thundered for a royal commission:
A great deal of publicity was given to
the action of the ex-Minister of Trade and
Customs in leasing a racehorse named
Billie from Mr. W. J. Smith. I have been
informed, though I cannot vouch for the
accuracy of the widespread rumor, that
the Treasurer, Mr. Spender has been
retained as legal adviser at £3OOO per
annum.
In the light of these rumors honorable
members will agree that there are features
surrounding the agreement which justify
more than a discussion in this Parliament
and make the appointment of a royal com-
mission imperative. I do not know how
Mr. Curtin became acquainted with the
facts. Even a frequenter of racecourses
for years might never have known that
“Mr. Rodney,” whose name appeared in
the race-books as the lessee of the race-
horse Billie, was the ex-Minister for Trade
and Customs. Generally a man assumes
a nom-de-plume only when he has done
something which he wishes to hide.
The last bit is particularly interesting,
for in the second case against the
moralist’s former pal and “liaison officer”
Garden —now, with his son Harcourt,
Parer and Farrell, charged with con-
spiracy to defraud Hancock and Gore—
Mr. Ward was asked whether he knew
Edward James Brooks or had gone under
or kept a bank account in that name.
Denying the whole impeachment, he was
handed a piece of paper on which, at the
instance of Garden’s counsel, he wrote
“E, J. Ward” and “E. J. Brooks,” each
name thrice. Reminiscent of the test
applied to the forger Pigott in Parnell v.
the “Times.” An irrelevancy, this, of
course; but the words “There are
features which justify more than a dis-
cussion in Parliament and make the
appointment of a royal commission im-
perative” are topical and pertinent. Very
pertinent to the Keane case, and an un-
answerable argument for a Parliamentary
debate on and a royal-commission inquiry
into that case.
It is nearly 18 months since Keane’s
self-styled “very dear friend” Goldberg
confessed to the Customs that Keane had
handed him 3000 dollars from a supply
without known limits for the purchase of
American finery; that he, Goldberg, had
laid out 4000 dollars without asking for
the difference, and that the goods had
been carried across the Pacific in the
care of a Keane employee (Import Pro-
curement), Miss Kelly, for delivery to
Keane’s widow. On the face of it Keane,
unlike the luckless Lawson, was engaged
in feathering his nest and using his
Ministerial privilege to evade duty on
dutiable articles. But, though nearly 11
months have elapsed since Goldberg was
fined, there has been no Parliamentary
debate or any public investigation.
Parliamentary debate was stifled all
last year on the ground that the case was
sub judice. As it concerns Keane, this
was not a fact then, it is not a fact now,
and it can never be a fact. Only if
“Labor” is set on shielding Keane at all
costs and concealing the facts of his “busi-
ness transactions” cap a Parliamentary
debate and a royal-commission inquiry,
with Goldberg, Miss Kjelly and Mrs.
Keane among the witnesses —they were
not asked to appear at the tardy Court
proceedings, with six months between
seizure of the goods and conviction—be
refused.
A Judge with a royal commission would
assuredly want to know why Goldberg,
with the charge hanging over his head,
was privileged to make one of his many
trips abroad—he generally goes to dollar
areas—and whether Keane had other
associates in “business transactions” and
kept a bank account in another name.
Mr. Ward’s own position should be
the subject of an immediate Parlia-
mentary debate, whatever else may be
necessary in the fulness of time. He
cannot now be judged on the score
of the damaging insinuations made
against him, though in repelling these he
admitted that he had received one pal, a
Government employee, as agent for a
concessipn-hunter, had got a fat job, if
not a juicy import licence, for another
pal and Government employee and
had placed his Ministerial car at
the service of persons with no right to
the privilege, going on to allow that a
relative had profited in the compensation
line by his alteration and back-dating of
a New Guinea ordinance. But from the
moment the damaging insinuations were
made in open court he should have been
suspended from office, as he was when
his Brisbane-line charges were referred
to a Judge.
Why hasn’t the Opposition recalled this
Brisbane-line precedent and demanded
that it should be followed? Why hasn’t
it pressed for a discussion of and an in-
quiry into the Keane business? Why isn’t
it holding the crowd in office to the
standards of Ministerial behavior the
same crowd exacted in the Lawson affair,
on the principle that a Minister of the
Crown, and hence his Government, must
be above suspicion? What is detaining
the Opposition? Quixotry, inertia or
scare?
War Trials in Vain?
The downfall of popular freedom and
Parliamentary government is being
wrought in Czechoslovakia by one of its
“liberators.” The instrument is a Com-
munist minority working under the same
Muscovite direction as previously in
Rumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary
and Poland. To secure for the Com-
munists control of the elections next
May and eliminate all parties except
their own, the Communist Minis-
ter of the Interior in an all-party Czech
Cabinet used the police to - raid the
offices of Socialist and Social-Democrat
parties, arrested their leaders, and the
new “Government” is now purging Par-
liament and all services. Molotov’s
immediate deputy is in Prague to see
that it is done. Czechoslovakia is merely
the latest victim on the Soviet’s con-
demned list of free small nations.
What the world should seriously begin
to take to account of is the revelation of
Stalin’s deliberate and cynical repetition
of the crimes for which all surviving
Nazis were but yesterday arraigned
and punished at Nuremberg. Not be-
cause Czechoslovakia has offended Russia
by opposing her policies or breaking
agreements—how swiftly, for instance,
did the Czechs reverse decision when
Moscow ordered that they should not
attend the Paris Conference on the Mar-
shall Plan! —but for the purposes of
Moscow’s own campaign to oppose the
restoration of Western Europe has this
attack on Czechoslovakia been ordered.
This is a repetition of that very
“crime against humanity,’.’ in the defi-
nition of it quoted by the British prose-
cuting counsel at Sir
David Maxwell-Fyfe, against the Nazi
criminals, §nd with endorsement by Rus-
sian members of the Nuremberg Court:
A co-ordinated plan of action for de-
struction of the social foundations of the
life of national groups, with the aim of
annihilating the groups themselves. The
objective is disintegration of the political
and social institutions of culture, language,
national feelings, religion, and the economic
existence of national groups, and the de-
struction of personal security, liberty,
health, dignity, and even the lives of the
individuals belonging to such groups.
Whatever might have been said before
Germany’s defeat, the decisions of
Nuremberg are now part of the law of
nations. The Soviet leaders were parties
to establishing those decisions. They at
least have had notice that their actions
are recognised international crimes.
Neither U.N.O. nor the Powers pledged
to establish the rule of international law
dare ignore the continuing perpetration
by one of those Powers of crimes for
which it has just assisted to condemn
others to suffer the supreme penalty.
Soviet Russia by its own actions is pro-
claiming that it is not fit to be accepted
into the society of nations under the
charter of freedom drawn up at San
Francisco. That Charter also the Soviet,
having first accepted, has now defiled.
Here are the pledges, not once but thrice
given, to which Stalin put his signature
along with Churchill and Roosevelt:
At Moscow, November, 1943: [Our
Governments] jointly declare that their
united action will be (after the war) con-
tinued for the organisation and mainten-
ance of peace and security... .based on the
principle of the sovereign equality of all
peace-loving States; and that sifter the
termination of hostilities they will not em-
ploy their forces militarily within the terri-
tories of other States except after joint
consultation.
At Tehran, December, 1943: We are in
heart and mind dedicated to the elimination
of tyranny and slavery, oppression and in-
tolerance.... We look with confidence to
the day when all peoples of the world may
live free lives, untouched by tyranny, and
according to their varying desires and their
own consciences.
At Yalta, February, 1945: Our meeting
here has reaffirmed our common, determina-
tion a secure and lasting peace which
will, in the words of the Atlantic Charter,
“afford assurance that all the men in all the
lands may live out their lives in freedom
from fear and want.”
Many people have lately been debating
whether Russia is, or is not, preparing
for another world war. Teh years ago
the same question about Hitler tormented
Europe, What we know beyond doubt is
that Moscow is broadcasting daily radio
propaganda against the democracies no
less vile and false than that of the Nazis
then, and is pursuing an identical path of
brutal oppression of the peoples of weak
neighboring States.
It is something definitely the concern
of others than the immediate victims. It
is a challenge which none of the democ-
racies can avoid, and is directed par-
ticularly against the United States.
For there is an American Presidential
election this year, and Henry Wallace is
rousing “Yanks wha hae” to support,
with his candidature, the Soviet cam-
paign against the Marshall plan.
In straight but restrained language
General Eisenhower has left no doubt
about the gravity of the outlook. World
peace is at the mercy of chance:
Our traditional friends in Western Europe
are in straitened circumstances, and some
are threatened with strangulation by a
militant political party whose obvious pur-
pose is to promote chaos and insurrection
for the advantage of an alien ideology.
Were those countries to give up the good
fight for our common heritage of liberty
and become the pawns of totalitarianism,
America’s security would be in dire danger.
We would find ourselves facing across
narrowing ocean and Arctic barriers a
despotic colossus spread over and beyond
the combined Eurasian territories of the
Roman Empire, Persia of antiquity, Ger-
manic kings, and Mongol khans.
In the withstanding of this possible de-
velopment American policy in the Medi-
terranean is of major importance.
Conditions today are sufficiently tur-
bulent, however, that war might be visited
upon the world without impetus of plan-
ning or deliberate policy. One isolated
action might precipitate conflict.
The one brake upon war today, says
General Eisenhower, is firmness in the
West. “We must remain the firm cham-
pion of those who seek to lead their
own lives in peace with their neighbors.
Our stout ties of common basic purpose
with the British Commonwealth and with
the democracies of Western Europe and
Latin America weigh heavily as a stabilis-
ing influence.”
True; byt the situation created by the
Soviet in the small countries all the way
down from the Baltic to the Black Sea
is not one which the Atlantic Powers can
suffer to be stabilised. Anywhere be-
tween the Dnieper and the Danube the
revolt may begin. Until it is consum-
mated the end of World War II will
not truly be fixed. What has happened,
is that Russia changed sides in its last
phase, reverting to the cause the Kremlin
supported at its outset.
The Call to Work!
Australia will not have the living
standards or social status of a progressive
democracy .until it blasts Chifleyism and
Communism off the landscape at the
first electoral opportunity. “Labor” in
Canberra has allowed dirty dogs to in-
timidate unions in essential industries
and to slow down the national produc-
tivity to frustration-point. Mr. Chifley
should have joined issue with the in-
dustrial anarchists long ago, but instead
he took the attitude that he wasn’t go-
ing to “crucify the workers.” Egged on
by Corns, .these “workers” are in the pro-
cess of rapidly crucifying themselves.
All Australians who have the interest
of their country at heart and possess the
elements of an understanding of what
national wealth is and who creates it must
feel their stomachs turn at sight of the
obstructive extravagance, political shuff-
ling, socialistic experimentalism and in-
dustrial futility that represent this coun-
try’s “government” from Canberra.
“Labor” was given great—almost totali-
tarian —powers in order to conduct a war.
It has retained many of those powers—
to the undenied hindrance of private
enterprise—into the third year of peace,
and, with its supreme financial controls,
has prevented industrial and economic
forces from reasserting themselves, re-
storing efficient, plentiful production and
hitting back with full democratic strength
against the evil and destructive cells
within our community.
There is no real evidence that Can-
berra “Labor” is concerned about
the crippling decline in the productivity
of the nation’s manpower, even though
it must be apparent that the fall in our
output per man-hour is an embarrass-
ment to the security of the Empire and
the whole democratic world. Moscow
has been working for years with this very
objective in view among the democracies,
and just now, in its “cold war,” is using
industrial lawlessness in the Empire, the
United States and Europe to the greatest
advantage.
Without any question Australia is fail-
ing pitiably to make the use of its
manpower and natural resources in the
way that ordinary commonsense almost
shrieks out to it to do. The vested in-
terests of selfish trade-unionism, the
obvious treachery of Communist indus-
trial saboteurs, the flabby, vote-conscious
industrial “policy” of the Chifley “Gov-
ernment” and the socialistic “control”
and bleeding of the management side of
industry and finance are preventing Aus-
tralians from living as they feel in all
sanity they should be living.
The industrial blockage starts from the
coalfields and the maritime and trans-
port industries, spreads through the steel-
works, brickworks, etc., and from there
branches out into every kind of indus-
trial and housing development. The
shortage of homes, the difficulty of keep-
ing farm properties in order, of rehabili-
tating deficient railways, factories, ship-
ping and other services, all have their
roots in coalfields anarchy, and are
aggravated at various points along the line
by similar Communist and “militant”
mischief, and by socialistic obstruction at
the seat of government.
Australia needs more political repre-
sentation and consideration for its essen-
tial producers, but in the Chifley re-
distribution of Parliamentary seats the
great rural industries will proportionately
get less. Our pressing need is for more
factory production, more water-conserva-
tion, more electric-power output, accele-
rated transport facilities, more housing—
but what does Mr. Chifley offer?
Nationalised banking, socialised medi-
cine, phony “social security” and any-
thing else that can be provided by the use
of more red-tape, the issue of more regu-
lations, the creation of more jobs for
bureaucratic deadheads, the spending of
more tax-revenue, or the issue of more
paper money.
The country’s real need is for work
and more work, production and more
production. And there are hundreds of
thousands of people waiting to do a
real job of work provided it enables
them to live a kind of life that is being
denied them today by deliberate social-
ist and Communist policy. Under
Chifleyism they feel that they are beaten
before; they start.


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Fight in Queensland.
Ordered last week by the Industrial
Court to return to work on Monday,
striking railwaymen in Queensland held
a “mass meeting” at Brisbane Trades Hall
and decided not to obey—about 500 made
the decision after listening to Communist
Rowe, from Melbourne, Premier Han-
lon promptly declared a state of emer-
gency, ordered the men back to work,
and outlawed picketing or the counselling
of strike action. The Railways Com-
missioner told his men to start on
Monday or consider themselves sacked.
Apparently in the conviction that Com-
munist treachery is now little short of
war against the State, the publication or
broadcasting of Com. exhortations to go
on with the illegal strike were banned.
In a broadcast of his own, Mr. Hanlon
‘made no bones about the position. He
asked the men to go back and avoid “all
the elements of civil war”:
The Government and people of Queens-
land have been very patient women and
children are now threatened with hunger
all the processes of law have been tried
but interlopers from the south have
decreed that the law shall be violated and
that their will shall prevail [They] are
threatening violence What do they think
we are? I have yet to know that Queens-
landers have abandoned their love of free-
dom and will bend their knees before the
first mimicking Molotov who enters the
country As long as I am the leader of
the people’s Government I shall refuse to
capitulate.
The strike was never justified or legal.
Strike leaders, reinforced by what Mr.
Hanlon called “the high command” of
the Communist party, ignored and defied
the Industrial Court all along the line.
Mr. Hanlon made it clear at once that
he stood by the law, and he never devi-
ated, despite threats. Knowing that it
was started by a minority and kept go-
ing by Communists, he gave the majority
of workers a chance to settle it them-
selves. Either they lacked the will or
were disorganised by Communist tactics.
The Premier only needed the final de-
fiance to act with decision.
On Monday morning some trains re-
sumed running; the Ipswich workshops
reopened with a reduced staff ; an attempt
to bring the trammies out had flopped.
There was the usual shrieking from the
Communist “high command.” Comrade
Brown, boss of the A.R.U., called on all
railwaymen to extend the strike; Com-
rade Elliott, of the Seamen’s Union,
threatened to blockade the Queensland
coast; Queensland wharfies announced a
strike till “the emergency regulations
were lifted.” It was the yelping of curs
and vicious mischief-makers.
Canberra’s only visible help to Mr.
Hanlon was a prohibition of Common-
wealth unemployment-relief to strikers
and members of unions “sponsoring a
strike of their members in key positions.”
But there is a pattern in this Communist
strategy that aims directly at Canberra,
Twice within two months State Premiers
have had to take drastic steps to break
Communist attacks on the peace and
welfare of their people. The mere
winning or losing of a strike is by
the way to Communists. Their aim
is production loss, confusion, unem-
ployment, idle factories, distrust, sus-
picion, hatred. They had many Vic-
torians facing that position in January ; in
February the target was Queensland,
Which State is next?
If there was a real Government in Can-
berra there would be no next. There is
ample evidence to justify use of Common-
wealth power to deal with these internal
enemies—surely Dr. Evatt and Mr. Chifley
are not blind to what is happening this
very moment in Europe, China and else-
where and since both Mr. Hollway and
Mr. Hanlon have shown that a display
of backbone settles their hash, they
should not be left to fight singly and
alone. But singly and alone is to be
their portion while Commonwealth
Labor” is in. Meantime, it is clear now
that all State Governments would be wise
to set about finding a means of stopping
these Communist-led upheavals before
they begin.
Back in Circulation.
Acquitted by a majority verdict (10 to 2)
on 14 charges of bribery and corruption,
Robert Cosgrove is back as head of the
Tasmanian “Labor” Administration,
slightly altered. So swift a passage from
dock to Cabinet would have been impos-
sible had the trial been held in one of
those States which do not accept majority
verdicts, and had the minority held out;
but anything can happen in Tasmania.
Indeed, under the rotten combination
of P.R. and five-year Parliaments there
is no lawful impediment to Cosgrove and
Co, remaining in office till December,
1051, without submitting themselves to
the people, any of them, Ministers or
ptiyjfl® members, even if Caucus has tp
choose another Premier. And, with the
no-election spirit predominant, unbroken
“Labor” rule till December, 1951, is quite
a possibility.
True, it is not exactly a probability.
For, apart from the hostility expected
from the Leg. Council, fount and origin
of the proceedings against ex-Minister
and ex-High Commissioner D’Alton,
now himself an M.L.C., the Assembly
Opposition is challenging the reconsti-
tuted “Government” vigorously, and on
one censure motion “Labor” had a
solitary vote to the good. Mr. Townley,
the Independent—greatly respected in
Tasmania for his fine character and
devotion to servicemen, as was shown
when he headed the poll for Denison,
with Mr. Cosgrove a poor second—was
against the “Government.” And Dr. Turn-
bull, hitherto openly dissatisfied, has had
to be humored with promises of medical
reforms on which he has set his heart, and
of transfer of control of the “special”
party fund, handled for so long by the
Premier, to the A.L.P. executive.
Into that “special” party fund, as the
royal commissioner discovered and
Pynter Cosgrove admitted, went substan-
tial contributions from bookmakers, pub-
licans, a dogracing man and a Sydney
agent for Tattersall’s, specially privileged:
Booze, Betting, the Tin Hare and
Lotteries. And referring to the “central”
party war-chest, Mr. Brooker, Mr. Cos-
grove’s substitute as Premier, and now
his deputy, complacently revealed that
“We get funds from eminent doctors and
lawyers, big businessmen and some big
capitalists.”
What a set! And what a mes-
sage to the worker who really wants
to work and who doesn’t drink or gamble
his substance away! In its early days
“Labor” depended on that type of
worker, and undertook to “emancipate”
him and to aim at “the cultivation of
an enlightened and self-reliant com-
munity.” Now it everywhere reduces him
to a choice between two deadly brands
of materialism, “Labor” and Communist,
and he is dreadfully apt to choose the
foreign brand. _
The Trade Agreements.
Mr. Chifley intervened in the debate on
International Trade Agreements in order
to “lift it to a higher level than local and
petty interests.” This, on the face of it,
was most exemplary. He said he had
hoped members would consider rather
the distresses of the world at large and
particularly those of “the Old Country.”
It was refreshing to hear Mr. Chifley
using that expression—though some of
the “bhoys” looked down their noses. But
Mr. Chifley’s methods are such that most
of the Opposition instantly became con-
vinced that he had something to put over.
His broad account of the events and war-
time emergencies that produced the
Churchill-Roosevelt agreement was unex-
ceptionable. It is true that the United
States leaders had, and still have, to “sell”
to their people the policy of aid to Britain
and Europe, “human nature being what
it is.”
But Mr, Chifley has got to “sell” to the
Australian people what he wants them to
do as their share in the lowering of trade
barriers by including preferential trade
treatment. He has not “sold” it yet. Like
the American President, he will finally
get it over —the position of Britain will
become so grave before this year is out
that Australia will be unable, anyway, to
refuse compliance. And in order to “sell”
to this people—hitherto left very much in
the dark—what Ministers have under-
taken in their name overseas, it is the
Prime Minister’s duty to convince them
that the help his Government is trying
nobly to contribute with one hand it is
not ignobly destroying with the other.
The Australian people, and the Oppo-
sition parties, are just as anxious that
Australia should do its fair share to put
the world right—and more than its
share if necessary to help Britain —as is
Mr. Chifley himself. To them it is a cry-
ing scandal and a national disgrace that
militant unions, bossed by men who are
avowed enemies of all Britain stands for, 1
should be allowed deliberately and
maliciously to hold up precious shipping
and freights—outward and inward —not
casually and in one place, but as a policy
and in all ports, by minority-called strikes
and limitation of work in union-devised
units of performance.
Mr. Chifley discounts the whole effect
of his exhortations to Parliament by his
persistent refusal to talk just as straight
to the unions. For so long as he avoids
doing that he will expose himself to the
charge of insincerity—and will deserve
it.
Jobbery Has the Field.
In 1901, our Federation year—it was a
census year also in this country and
others —there was no great difference be-
tween the populations of Australia and
Canada, That of Australia was 3,733,800,
exclusive of aborigines (about 70,000);
that of Canada, with Red Indians (about
100,000), was 5,331,300. Last year’s
enumerations were 7,580,000 and
12,100,000 respectively, so Canada has
gone right ahead of us. If present trends
continue there will be twice as many
Canadians as Australians before many
years are out, though equality was a fair
prospect for Australia 47 years ago.
No one reason can be assigned for
Canada’s much greater progress in this
most vital of matters, but it is signifi-
cant that in Canada, as in the great con-
tiguous republic, regional development
on sound political lines, indispensable to
the proper working of a Federal system
in spacious countries, has not been stifled
as it has been in Australia.
In 1901 the U.S.A. had 45 States,
seven of which (North Dakota, South
Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho,
Utah and Washington) had been ad-
mitted within the previous 12 years. It
now has 48, and will soon have 50, though
in Alaska there are only 40,000 whites.
In Canada there were seven provinces
in 1901 and nine in 1905, Alberta and

Saskatchewan having in that year' been
formed out of the North-West Territories,
out of which other provinces may come.
Each of the nine has “full powers
to regulate its own local affairs and
dispose of its revenues, provided only
it does not interfere with the
action and policy of the central Ad-
ministration.” Australia remains with the
six original States, except that South
Australia surrendered part of its
domains to the Commonwealth, which
has grossly neglected the gift as a territory.
And the distribution of population is
appalling. More than half live in six
cities, where Communists have their head-
quarters, emerging and concentrating to
wage forms of war on whole communi-
ties, and nearly three-sevenths in one
State. There are no counterparts in
Canada or the U.S.A., fortunately for
those countries.
Increase of members in the U.S.A. and
Canada is determined by growth of popu-
lation and by healthy regional develop-
ment nourishing twin loyalties. In Aus-
tralia it is to be determined by “Labor”
jobbery and nothing else. If “Labor”
has its way Australians will have to sup-
port 682 members, for the most part paid
extravagantly by Canadian standards,
and with extravagant habits and extrava-
gant claims to life pensions, already
brought off in two cases, compared with
Canada’s 841, of whom 120 are Upper
House nominees, and the 604 paid mem-
bers decided upon in Britain by a Gov-
ernment, “Labor,” but, with some sense
of decency. How a small and almost
stationary community of taxpayers is
going to maintain 682 members and the
satellite army of public employees, now
fast approaching 600,000, never enters
into “Labor’s” calculations, much less its
worries.
POLITICAL POINTS
Launching a midsummer railway strike
in tropical and sub-tropical Queensland
when industrial law was at the service of
all hands was an act of Oriental bar-
barism, designed to produce conditions —
of misery, disorder and the collapse of all
authority other than Communist —under
which Oriental barbarism could make it-
self supreme. The foul plan miscarried,
because Queensland is no longer
wholly dependent on railways for
transport; because the Court, despising
Communist threats and insults, stood
steadily for industrial law; and because
the emergency produced the man. No
cringing coward like the Czech Benes,
who, during the same period, abandoned
his people to internal enemies and their
foreign masters, but a real leader in the
Old Digger Premier Hanlon. It has been
shown in Queensland, as in France and
Victoria, that a resolute man with a good
cause and lawful weapons can put Com-
munist ruffianism to rout.
P. R. T. Wills ceased to be Queens-
land’s Railway Commissioner last week;
and it was the most eventful week in
his long career as railwayman. On his
application the Industrial Court ordered
the “executive officers” of the striking
unions to instruct their members to re-
turn to work on Monday, Wills followed
with a direction to all railwaymen,
“whether on strike or standing down,” to
be at their posts at the usual time on
Monday or consider their jobs and privi-
leges gone. His successor, Maloney, tak-
ing over at the very time, announced in
his first report that trains were running.
With his running-shoes on, as always,
Chifley whined last week that the siege
of Queensland by Communists was “a
matter for the State Government and the
Industrial Court.” The extension of the
upheaval to ports and shipping by leaders
of federated unions makes it “a matter
for” a Crimes Act prosecution, followed,
on conviction, by deportation of Healys
and Elliotts, The U.S. counterparts of
these Communist immigrants are not
only denied union office under the Taft-
Hartley Act, but are being deported at a
great rate, and the country is finding then-
room preferable to their company.
Note to Hanlon: Turn up Section 119
of the Commonwealth Constitution:
The Commonwealth shall protect every
State against invasion and, on the appli-
cation of the Executive Government of the
State, against domestic violence.
Said Hanlon in his Saturday-night broad-
cast. “The High Command of the Com-
munist party has invaded Queensland.”
Again; “Interlopers from the south have
decreed that the law shall be violated.”
Further; “These opponents of constitu-
tional Government are threatening
violence to anyone who dares to obey the
order of the Court”
When Hollway brought in the emer-
gency legislation that ended the Com-
munists’ Melbourne tram and bus strike
and strangled their Victorian railway
strike in its birth, the “Age” protested
that he had gone too far. Similarly,
“S. M. Herald” discovered that Hanlon
“damaged a strong position by attempting
to impose a partial censorship on news-
papers and broadcasting services,” TMs
means, if it means anything, that in the
situation to which reduced
his State it was Hanlon’s duty to sit back
and let “newspapers and broadcasting
stations,” led by A.8.C., publish “Strike
Committee” incitements to continued law-
lesness. If a Government chooses to
defend its people against the Communist
conspiracy it must on no account depart
from the lily-fingered conventions of
nineteen-century Liberalism, Cold feet
or softening of the brain?
Word from the Molonglo:
All is as quiet as death down here. Nothing
done by the Government; nothing attempted by
the Opposition. The Opposition view appears
to be that the Garden of Eden is murmurous
for its return to power, but that the Flaming
Angel with the Flaming Sword cannot evict
the present tenants until the electorate votes.
So the Op. just sits and muses on the great
things it will do when it gets under the plum-
tree again.
Westralia is considering a scheme for
supplying Perth with gas produced at
Collie and piped 120 miles to the metro-
polis. German experts have been con-
sulted and various plans are being studied.
One, involving an outlay of a million
and a half, would use 108,000 tons of
Collie coal a year and would produce
8,000,000 cubic feet of gas a day.
Having regained control of most of
the East Indies, the Dutch planned for a
new K.P.M. service between Singapore
and Fremantle, taking in intermediate
ports; and Westralia sorely needed the
service. It has been desperately short
of shipping these latter years. But
Chifley “won’t crucify the workers” —
that is to say, he is afraid to do anything
or say anything detrimental to the Com-
munist ban on N.E.I, shipping, which
dates from September, 1945. So the
Dutch have pigeonholed their plan till
Australia gets a Government that governs.
A.B.C. —always original (or peculiar)—
announced that its “London editor” dif-
fered from the rest of the experts on
Czechoslovakia in that, in his opinion,
no Communist coup had been effected
and the new Cabinet would resemble the
old. And so it does, in the sense in which
a bad egg resembles a good egg. Spend-
ing so much as it does in its lavish
fashion on “London editors” and the
like, A.B.C. lost £66,300 in 1946-47.
The loss for the year to June 30
will be at least £266,300 if the cost of the
“A.B.C. news service” is added, though
that is unlikely.
Western Queenslanders, noting Ward’s
determination, if and when he can, to
connect them with Sydney via Bourke
and Hanlon’s anxiety to run lines into
Queensland ports from their west, have
examined estimated costs of both
schemes. They came to the conclusion
that Diesel road-trains could do the job
ait a fraction of the cost. Anyhow, Long-
reach says an experiment is to be made
with trailer-trucks and “will be watched
with interest by official circles” —pro-
vided “official circles” can stop running
round in circles long enough to watch
anything.
The press-boomed Fraser (Eden-
Monaro), who every 18 months or there-
abouts makes a show of criticising
“Labor” administration and then scurries
back to his hollow-log, uttering scared
compliments, has had the gall to write
this: —
Superannuation for Federal members,
financed from Parliamentary pay, may cost
us blokes in safe seats plenty each month.
But we won’t mind that, realising its in-
surance value to swing-seaters.
Fraser’s seat is as “safe” as a humpy
built on quicksand. And the “superan-
nuation” that is to “cost us blokes
plenty” is to be “financed” by a trifle of
30-bob a week out of the extra £5OO p.a.
“us blokes” voted themselves last year,
to the end that, on defeat or retirement,
they may draw £6 to £9 a week for life.
according to length of “service.” That
would give Fraser, when licked next
year, more than any broken serviceman
gets, and nearly twice as much as any
war widow. He has no military record,
though 37 when the war broke out.
Argentina, it transpires, will not attempt
force to press “claims” to the Falklands.
Its “navy,” declared to have been rolling
round Deception Island for “routine exer-
cises,” has now hit the breeze for home
and senoritas. No doubt in due course
the Chilean President will explain that his
Government had merely been looking for
possible penguin settlements in case it
should run out of guano. Meanwhile
there is now some concern among those
foreign correspondents lest the Guate-
malans gobble up British Honduras.
Note made in the banking case;
Dr. Evatt: The Commonwealth legisla-
tive power includes the power to prohibit
and, with a strange reason, to grant a
monopoly. A monopoly is not a prohibi-
tion, but a selection.
So “selection” of all the trading banks is
consistent with absolute freedom of
trade, commerce and intercourse (Sec-
tion 92). It is an argument that might
appeal to one of the “people’s courts”
which infest Communist countries to
which Czechoslovakia has been added by
exercise of “the power to prohibit and
grant a monopoly.”
Playford forecasts State deficits of
£9,000,000 this year and “dreads to think
what heights our public expenditure will
reach or what its ultimate effects on the
community will be” unless there is an
“alteration in our methods of admini-
stration and taxation,” The one income-
tax he sees as having “led to a large
expansion of (Federal) Government
spending and the diversion of many per-
sons into Government employment.”
“Expansion” and diversion are right; but
“Labor,” not the one income tax, is to
blame.
By a great effort the Royal Commis-
sioners who have been overhauling the
Westralian Government railways (A. J.
Gibson and D. H. C. du Plessis) restrained
themselves from pronouncing them the
worst in the world. They did say they
knew of “no other comparable railway
system in any other part of the civilised
world which has been so neglected”....
[and] is so “completely run down” as,
“with one or two minor exceptions,” to
be “unable even remotely to keep abreast
of developments in other countries.”
And the root cause of the deterioration
and decay is the shortsighted policy, pur-
sued during the past 20 years, of economis-
ing on railway expenditure regardless of
consequences.
For 17 of those 20 years—indeed from
April, 1924, to April, 1947, except for one
Parliamentary term—“ Labor” was in
office. However, “Labor” did establish
lotteries, with “Labor” worthies in con-
trol. One must be fair.
In the cliffs of Sheringham, Norfolk,
archaeologists have discovered remains
pointing to the existence of “man-like
beings” a million years ago. The
Director of the Museum of Archaeology
suggests that the Norfolk man “was prob-
ably unclothed and had no home.” So
they had their Communist and “Labor”
Governments a million years ago!
It has been a frequent complaint of
N.S.W. Commissioner Hartigan that his
railways should be protected against com-
mercial road transport because road
vehicles can pick the most profitable
haulage, whereas the railways, being “a
common carrier”-—-except, of course, dur-
ing strikes—have to accept all kinds of
freight. Now Hartigan announces that
his railways won’t haul freight for any
distance less than 50 miles, the tax-free
limit for road vehicles. He blames coal
and rolling-stock shortages. Nothing
about people preferring the faster and
safer (from pillage and demurrage) road
transport over tax-free distances.
Praising a racy account of America’s
“robber barons” and bosses (“it is difficult
not to feel a sneaking liking for some
of them”), a Melbourne “Herald” young
man closed with an innocent question:
How long will it be before it will be
possible to do a book like this about
Australia?
Well, it can’t be long now, young fellow.
In urging on his fellow-peers Deakin’s
old idea of an Imperial secretariat (now
loosely attributed to Curtin) and a
modernised Imperial Conference, with
“special” meetings of Prime Ministers
and monthly meetings of High Com-
missioners, Lord Bruce suggested an un-
fortunate title: “The Council of British
Nations.” It irritated Smuts into saying
he would have nothing to do with the
thing. He can’t forget that there are
more South Africans of Dutch than
British descent, nor can Mackenzie King,
all his 20 years as P.M. dependent on
Quebec, ignore the numerical prepon-
derance of French over Canadians of
English origin. Their feelings might
have been allayed if “Commonwealth”
had been put before “Nations.” So,
though most of the Lords graciously
allowed that the new member had made
out a good case, nothing will come of it.
Lord Rothermere to Wickham Steed
in August, 1938:
If you or anyone else believes that the
Dominions are foolish enough to light for
a Moscow-owned Prague you are laboring
under a strange delusion.
For this the newspaper baron was scolded
by Sydney’s morning papers:
Britain’s security is bound up with the
fate of the Czechoslovakian republic. Lord
Rothermere cannot or will not see this.—
“D.T.”
As for the Dominions Czechoslovakia
would be recognised today as Belgium was
in 1914 the stalking-horse for German
aims against the Empire. And that cer-
tainly includes Australia.— “S. M. Herald."
It didn’t include Australia. Chamber-
lain’s biographer has set it on record that
Lyons, Savage, Smuts and Mackenzie
King told Chamberlain that a war for
Czechoslovakia would be desperately un-
popular ; and Chamberlain was of the
same opinion respecting the U.K. In-
finitely wise were these men, three of
them now dead, compared with the
superiah persons in newspaper offices.
Queensland “Courier-Mail” has a
theory that countries with shaky curren-
cies have taken to buying wool, seeing
it as a solid form of security in a wool-
hungry world, Czechoslovakia didn’t
have to buy from the Australian and
N.Z. “Labor” Governments, its promises
to pay being deemed sufficient. Now
that it has gone Commo, the desperate
thought has come to Peter Fraser that
he should ask for a few bawbees on
account.

Top job in Britain’s Diplomatic Service
these days is undoubtedly that of Ambas-
sador in Washington. Lord Inverchapel
followed Lothian and Halifax after ser-
vice in most of the big legations and
embassies, culminating in four years in
Moscow and an assignment as Special
Envoy in Java during the ticklish early
stages of the Indonesian trouble. He re-
tires shortly and is to be succeeded by
a man from outside the service—43-year-
old Oliver Franks, Provost of Queen’s
College, Oxford. The appointment is a
recognition by the British Government
of the importance of the Marshall Plan,
as Franks is reputed to know more than
any man in Britain about the European
end of the scheme. His career has been
a strange one. Professor of Moral Philo-
sophy in Glasgow when war broke out,
he got leave to join the Ministry of Sup-
ply. By the end of the war he was Per-
manent Secretary of the Ministry, but
refused requests to stay in the Civil Ser-
vice, preferring to go back to his pro-
fessing. When the Marshall Plan was
first mooted Franks was persuaded to
take on the task of co-ordinating the pre-
paratory work of the 16-nation pro-
gramme, and later went to Washington to
explain the proposals of the European
Committee. That accomplished, he went
back to Oxford, and it’s a pretty safe bet
he’ll return there again when be feels
he has tidied things up on the other side
of the Atlantic.
Three new K.Cs. have been added to
the list in Melbourne on the recommenda-
tion of Herring, CJ. They are J. A.
Spicer, who was Liberal Senator for Vic-
toria in 1940, but was defeated at the sub-
sequent election ; T. W. Smith, Sydney-
born and a brilliant lawyer ; and D. M.
Campbell, who shared the Supreme Court
Judges’ Prize in 1923 with E. H. Cobhilf,
now Supreme Court Librarian. The trio
are all sitting amongst the 30-odd wigs
assembling daily at the High Court in the
Bank case.
During the past few years persons and
groups interested in water,- land- and
forest-conservation have come to know
Jocelyn Henderson, who bobs up in
all sorts of spots in south-east Aus-
tralia crusading for the establishment
of Community Forests. Her idea is that
every town and village should establish
its own forest wherein the citizens should
work for their mutual benefit. On both
sides of the Mfirray her scheme has been
taken up by municipal and shire councils
and she persuaded the N.S.W. Govern-
ment to include in the Local Government
Act permission for councils to spend
money on forest projects. Now she s had
the satisfaction of having her idea
adopted by the Cumberland County
Council, which proposes to plant its first
community forest near Bankstown. Three
others are to follow in the Sydney area.
Miss Henderson, who is a daughter of
poet-author Walter Henderson, lives at
Upper Wantagong, out from Albury,
when she gets a chance to go home from
her tree crusade. ,
A convention of all Australian
branches of the Royal Empire Society
the first on record —was held in Sydney
last week to coincide with the visit of
Colonel Archer Cust, Secretary-General
of the Society. Cust served with the
R.F.A. from 1915 to 1919 in France,
Germany and Egypt, after which he
joined the Palestine Civil Service. In the
Much-promised Land he was successively
A.D.C. and Private Secretary to the High
Commissioner, and somewhere in his
term of service there he sandwiched in a
couple of years as Private Secretary to
the Governor of Northern Rhodesia.
During Hitler’s war he did a good job
of work, with Military Intelligence and
the Department of Psychological War-
fare.
Colonel Albert Ernest Coates, C.8.E.,
F.R.A.C.S., of Melbourne, who, at the
request of the R.S.L., has been appointed
a member of the Far Eastern Commis-
sion to discuss Japanese peace terms, was
Chief M.O. in the p.-0.-w. hospital, Siam,
1944-45, . a title which hides sufficient
achievement to make a dozen novels.
It covers the dreadful conditions on
the Burma railway when prisoners
were dying like flies and Coates, the
only doctor, in one camp, was per-
forming operations with a butcher’s
knife, without anaesthetics, and scraping
out tropical ulcers with a sharpened tea-
spoon. One day Coates went over to the
Japanese military hospital and fold the
doctor that he would like to help him
with his patients and would give him any
supplies he could spare if the Japanese
would reciprocate. Thq Japanese doctor
burst into tears. “I can do nothing,” he
said, throwing up his hands. “My Gov-
ernment hasn’t given me anything, either,
and my men are just as badly off as yours
are.” The engineers, he added, had re-
ceived orders from higher up that the
useless railway which was believed to be
essential to the Japanese policy of
Greater Asia had to be finished in a cer-
tain time regardless of the cost in lives,
Jap or European. Coates was born at
Ballarat and learnt medicine at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne.
Auckland’s new Chief Engineer for the
Metropolitan Drainage Board will be
James Paterson Porter, now engineer of
the main drainage division of the London
County Council. An old boy of Otago
University, he went to England in 1915
and graduated as Bachelor of Science.
The Admiralty commandeered him during
Hitler’s war as civil engineer in the Tyne
and Hunter district.
Wilfred Richardson, retired after build-
ing Victoria’s railway carriages for half
a century, was one of the engineers who
helped produce the Spirit of Progress.
Born in Sussex, he came here with his
parents as a babe. Now he is returning
to see his birthplace, Test cricket in the
Old Country and Victoria’s Governor,
Sir Winston Dugan, soon to leave for
England. During a recent visit to the
Newport workshops, the Governor in-
sisted that the railway-carriage expert
visit him in England.
Betwixt wig and collar are here de-
picted the features of Reginald Roderick
St. Clair Chamberlain, Crown Prosecutor
of South Australia. Coventry, who met
him in slightly more auspicious circum-
stances than do most persons who cross
his path in working hours, found him a
cheery bloke with twinkling eyes. Those
who have watched Chamberlain during
the 20 years since he took over from Eric
Millhouse claim that no Court proceed-
ings have ever been able to shake him out
of his customary calm, and he has never

been known to show discourtesy to a
witness. Country-bred and a product of
Adelaide ’Varsity, where he has for some
years lectured in Criminal Law, Joe
was called to the Adelaide bar in 1922.
In his student days he won his rowing
blue, but at 47 he has settled down to golf.
Touched-down in Sydney on his way
to New Zealand for defence talks, Air-
Vice-Marshal Sir Hugh Lloyd, Air
C.-in-C. Far East, who was in charge of
the air defence of Malta for 14 of the
toughest months of the brave little
island’s travail. His planes beat off more
than 1000 air attacks and clawed down
hundreds of enemy machines, causing an
Italian commentator to remark “The
only way to take Malta is to sink it.
Welsh-born, Lloyd was only 18 when the
First World War broke out, but he went
right through it, first with the 8.E.F., and

then with the R.A.F., collecting a M.C.
and D.F.C. In the second war he was
with Bomber Command during the Battle
of Britain and the months when the
shadow of invasion hung over the land.
Then came the Malta chapter, after
which he went to North Africa as Chief
of Staff to Lord Tedder, and had the job
of commanding the Coastal Air Force in
protection of convoys and attacks on
Axis supply lines. Cover for the in-
vasions of Sicily and Italy followed, with,
in due course, the landings on Corsica
and in the South of France. When Ger-
many cracked Lloyd was sent to the
Pacific. He set up H.Q. of Bomber Com-
mand on Okinawa and had Lancasters
ready to strike and Lincolns on the way
out when the Jap collapse came. Since
then he has put in a term as senior in-
structor at the Imperial Defence College.
His present command extends from Cey-
lon to Hong Kong. In Sydney “Hughie
Pughie” remarked that he had a warm,
regard for all Australians who had served
with him. In Malta and elsewhere he
found our chaps among the best fighter-
pilots and “without a doubt” the best
reconnaissance men,

T. D. A. Cockerell, who filled the chair
of Zoology at the University of Colorado
for many years and described more new
species of bees than any other naturalist.
A stream of scientific papers flowed from
his pen —on fossils from the Florrisant
shales of the Rocky Mountains, snails
from Peru, wild bees from Australia and
South Africa, fish-scales from —well, all
over the world —and he found time in
between to evolve red sunflowers to
demonstrate the Mendelian Theory.
Cockerell came from a gifted -family: a
brother, Sydney, was Custodian of the
Fitzmaurice Museum at Cambridge, and
Douglass, another brother, won fame as
a binder of classic books—some were
on exhibition at the Melbourne Museum
a few weeks ago.
All the way from 22 The Precincts,
Canterbury, Archdeacon Julian Bick-
ersteth, Canon of Canterbury, M.C.,
M.A., recently told Sydney’s Millions
Club just how the precincts and the
Cathedral itself had fared during the blitz.
As treasurer of the cathedral he gently
admonished the bomb which blew out
£40,000-worth of windows in the building,
adding that the total damage to the
cathedral area was nearly £300,000. “So
a fund was started in England and two-
thirds of the money has been collected.
Canada asked to join in, too, and now I
have come to Australia because your
churches want to help. But,” he con-
eluded, twinkling, “as I promised the
chairman of the club that I wouldn t say
a word about finance in my address, 1
won’t.”
Geoffrey Bridson, the 8.8.C.’s senior
feature-producer, who complained m
Melbourne that he couldn’t find a single
Australian folk-song, should have con-
sulted the Rev. Dr. Percy Jones, Ph.D.,
Mus. Doc., Diocesan Inspector of Music
in Schools for the Archdiocese of Mel-
bourne and choirmaster at St. Patrick s
Cathedral. For a decade the cheery little
cleric has been collecting the songs bul-
lockies, sundowners and shearers sang
around their campfires. One of his
sources is J, O’Neill, of Sandringham, a
retired civil servant who picked up the
ditties back in the ’eighties when his
mother kept a hotel on the track north of
Bendigo. Differing from Professor
Heinze, who thinks that Australia will
have to wait 100 years for a genuine

Final curtain-speeches are seldom illu-

Post at the first night of the Australian
opera at the Princess, Melbourne, was
an exception, “Fifteen years ago,” said
the A.B.C. conductor, “1 conducted my
first grand opera and I was told that I
had undoubted talent and should be given
a chance. This is the second Australian
opera I have conducted.” As a comment
on opportunities for local talent it
couldn’t have been much neater. Post’s
middle name, however, indicates that his
parents must have had confidence in the
latent potentialities of their infant. Born
in Sydney in 1904, he was educated at the
C.8.C., was professor of piano and oboe
at the Sydney Conservatorium from 1925
to 1930 and enlisted in 1940, emerging
as a major. He has been guest conductor
of symphony orchestras in Adelaide and
Melbourne.

mechanics that sometimes confounded
litigants who came before him, and a
lively wit. On one occasion a fish-and-
chips man was claiming £lOOO for in-
juries to his boy. When the lad did not
appear in Court Blair remarked: “I
assume the boy is looking after the
fish while his father is looking after the
chips.” A native of Dunedin, he put in
20 years on the Bench.
Into the Silence;
At 61, at Nanango (Q.), Albert Harland,
one of the best-known public men in Yarraman
and South Burnett district. Several terms
councillor of Rosalie Shire, foundation mem-
ber of the Show Society, member of Chamber
of Agricultural Societies of Queensland, and
chairman of many charitable organisations, he
found time to run a commission-agent’s busi-
ness till retirement in 1946.
In London, at 75, Sir Lawrence Wensley
Chubb, former secretary of the National Play-
ing Fields Association, who devoted most of
his life to the preservation of the English
countryside. He was born at Lauraville
ney’s Creek), Victoria.
In Melbourne, at 53, Major Harold Edgar
Roach, M.C., veteran of two world wars. He
served on Gallipoli with the sth Battery, Ist
Divisional Artillery. He was a great-grandson
of Captain Wilbahram Liardet, who founded
Port Melbourne (Liardet Beach) in 1839.
In Melbourne, at 63, John Morrice Bridge,
the engineer who put Yallourn and its huge
brown-coal deposits on the map. Appointed
engineer of coal supplies to the Victorian
Electricity Commission when Yallourn was only

consultant to the Commission.
In Perth, at 53, Henry Sherman Thompson,
Associate-Professor of Old English at the Uni-

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INDS"
“Jasby”; There have in the past been
many complaints that the welfare of the
abo. has been neglected or left to the
caprices of people who don’t know their
business. A recent advt. issued by the
N.S.W. Chief Secretary’s Department
should bring results that will do away
with all that. Applicants for the job of
trainees of the Aborigines’ Welfare Board
must have reached Leaving Certificate or
Matriculation standard, and will be re-
quired to do a two-year Uni. course in
subjects not stated in the advertisement.
Abos who can read and who are inter-
ested inrthe future of themselves and their
fellows will no doubt be gratified to learn
that:
Those applicants whose qualifications are
deemed to merit further consideration will
be required to write an essay of not more
than 2000 words on the subject “The
Significance of Atomic Energy.”
Old men of the tribes will possibly grunt
that Daisy Bates, who did quite a lot.for
the dusky folk, wouldn’t have recognised
an atom if she’d stumbled over one in
the middle of the Nullarbor Plain ; but
then old men are notoriously conser-
vative.

“F.S.”: Before I swallow that camera
I would like to ask “Flathead” (B.
18/2/’4B) how he differentiates between
one picture and another in regard to
“composition.” If composition is de-
pendent on the shape of the canvas and
what looks excellent in an oblong can
be an eyesore in a circle, then the Rem-
brandt self-portrait in the National
Gallery in Melbourne, which is an oblong
measuring 24in. by 29in., would lose all
the qualities of good painting if it were
cut into a round shape, Tiepolo’s
“Banquet of Cleopatra,” roughly 10ft. by
9ft, is generally regarded as inferior to
the Rembrandt. Would the painting be
one whit better if the canvas were cut
down to 24in. by 29in.? The gallery con-
tains every imaginable shape and size of
canvas, from Corot’s tiny “Sketch at
Scheveningen,” llfin, by 6fin., and Van
Eyck’s 7|in. by lOfin. “Madonna” to
Puvis de Chavannes’ three enormous
cartoons depicting St. Genevieve revic-
tualling Paris, which would provide roof-
ing for two average Housing Commis-
sion dwellings. If “Flathead” can prove
any determining principle in this medley
other than convenience, accident or
mere preference bn the part of the artist,
I will duly ingurgitate any make of photo-
graphic machine he likes to mention.
“Strop”; “F.S.” (B. 11/2/’4B). claims
that in the work of an Old Master every
inch is a perfect part of a perfect whole,
but he fails to see the reason, which is
scientific as well as artistic. Every com-
mercial artist knows that the visual centre
of interest in a picture is in an area which
lies higher than, and to the left of, the
centre. He knews that the space in the
top-right and bottom-left corners is
better left blank because nobody ever
looks at it. Many of the Old Masters
knew this instinctively. Take Whistler’s
portrait of Carlyle. The head is in the
optical centre spot; the lines.of drapery
run towards the right-bottom corner;
the rest of the “space-filling” could have
been done by a house-painter. The com-
position is masterly because it concen-
trates all attention on one scientifically
correct area by covering the rest of the
space with a flat coat of grey. As for
the beauty contests, the judges favor long
legs because these raise the'hipline into
the optical centre, which is higher than the
actual centre, “Dumpiness” is simply
not aesthetic because it lowers the centre
of gravity in the balance of the figure.

“Cough”: Certain that there had been
one left in the packet, I surveyed its sad
emptiness and then went into the coffee-
house to sample a cup of my other weak-
ness. I dismally repeated my standard
greeting “Any Smokes?” to the man-
ageress, and received the headshake I
knew would come. “No. We haven’t
had any for a fortnight. Things are
very bad just now.” “Same old line,” I
thought. “But,” she added, “would you
like one of mine?” I had my matches
at the. ready. She handed me the mak-
ings.

“Hep-2-3-4”: With the air of pride
that marks the correspondent reporting
the first cuckoos, a London “Times”
reader has written that he observed
“a man of middle age and sober
dress walking down a street near Hyde
Park, apparently on his way to an office.
In fact, the only unusual feature was that
he was engaged in shaving himself with
a patent machine,” Dwelling on the pos-
“Next time remember to bring a spare tyre!”
sibilities of this timesaver, I thought of
what it would have meant to Black Harry,
a footslogger whose chin was inevitably
bristling like a nail-brush when the panic
signal sounded five minutes before a big
parade. He had to make-do with slow
equipment, and with it gave a grand show'
of courage on the morning of a Brigade
parade, when, with the Brig, only one
rank away, Harry scraped off the last
bristle, emptied his pannikin of hot-
water, and stowed the mirror and other
gear in his pouches, basic, just as the
Brig, turned. The platoon-sergeant, who
watched the whole manoeuvre from the
corner of a horrified eye, attributed to
it the mouth-twitch he had for the follow-
ing fortnight.

“Wusslean”; One of the amusing
features of commercial radio is the in-
congruity that frequently exists between
the broadcast material and the goods or
services offered to, or hurled at, the un-
seen audience by the “sponsors.” My
youngster, thanks to the sponsoring by
the manufacturers of a patent tonic food
beverage of a radio serial about pirates,
has become firmly convinced that these
bloodthirsty wretches derive their vigor
and ferocity from frequent draughts of a
concoction of milk, eggs, malt and
similar intoxicants. Can someone tell
me why potted drama is expected to
push along the sales of soap and other
toilet requirements, and why is a session
of ballet music sponsored by a firm of
funeral-directors?
“Zake”: With Parliament hogging the
national station, and the inter-State
unit almost exclusively devoted to
churning out the culture of Tin Pan
Alley, I, at times, dredge the ether of
the commercials in search of decent
music. Although over two stations it is
non-existent, for the rest the assay is just
about high enough to justify tolerating
the advts. Of these, the ones least likely
to engender in the listener hostility to
the products advertised are those referred
to by the announcer in an impersonal
tone. But when he implores you, in a
voice vibrant with synthetic sincerity and
sometimes even simulated passion, to try
the product of his sponsor, with the im-
plication that he himself never uses any-
thing else—well, who wouldn’t bless the
maker of the set for having provided a
switch-off knob? I wonder if the
sponsors of some radio sessions ever
stop to think that the “heartfelt” appeal
to buy their stuff quite often stirs in fed-
up listeners buyer-resistance of a most
dogged kind.
“Strop”; My artistic friend had caught
the craze for Chinese “culture.” Show-
ing me a piece of jade, he lectured me
long and eloquently on the satin-smooth-
ness of the polish, the exquisite grada-
tions of the monochrome shadings, the
delicate tracery of the pattern, the
opalescent beauty of the blended tones
caught aqd frozen in the stone when the
world was young; and so forth. Then I
invited him to go with me to view the
assembly hall of a new bank building.
From floor to ceiling the walls were
covered with acres of gleaming tiles that
were identical in polish, pattern and
color with the precious piece of jade he
had been raving about. “How does it
appeal to you?” I asked, “father
monotonous, don’t you think?” was his
reply. And that was the last J heard
from him about Chinese aesthetic lore.

“Melbourne Cup”: Back in 1891 Mal-
volio won the Melbourne Cup from a
field of 34. Owned and trained by J.
Redfearn, he was ridden by the owner’s
eldest son. The “Cup” became the
father’s most valued possession, and
when he died it passed on to the son,
who ultimately settled in Singapore, tak-
ing it with him. During the Japanese
occupation fte escaped to South Africa,
but died there; his wife also died as a
result of her concentration-camp experi-
ences. Their daughter, with her husband,
got away to Australia. When the war
was over the daughter returned to see
.what she could salvage from the old home
in Singapore. She found nothing left
but one item; tarnished and dull but
otherwise intact was the 1891 Melbourne
Cup.

“Chevroford”; The latest menace to
the road-hog is ex-Major Tom Cunning-
ham, first constable in Melbourne’s
mobile traffic section. An official
photographer when in the army, he made
the suggestion that a fast camera might
be a great assistance to magistrates when
dealing with traffic breaches. His idea
was approved, and the traffic eye was
set up to overlook Oliver’s Hill, one of
the worst holiday-traffic spots around
Melbourne. He landed five offenders on
the first day. The magistrate had only
to take one glance at the photo to register
a conviction.
“X.S.”: As a result of the success of
the first experimental use of cameras for
detecting traffic breaches during the
Christmas holidays,* Victorian police
patrol-cars will probably be equipped
with high-speed photographic eyes in the
future. The guilty may foot the bill.
When five offenders got convictions re-
cently in the Frankston Court the P.M.
added two and sixpence costs to pay
for the developing and printing of the
films that had helped to convict them.

“Ike Hollar”: The game of knifey,
which “Laetitia” (B. 4/2/’4B) calls peg-
knife, called for some real skill, though
few youngsters got further than the
simple throw or the “double-jack.” The
knife had to bury its point in the ground
or the player was out. After the first
simple throws from the fingers the game
went through the pitches from the bent
knee (each in turn), the bent elbows (that
from the right elbow, the left hand hav-
ing to be used, was tough for all but
molly-handers), each shoulder and the
top of the head ; the apex of perform-
ance being the cast from the top of the
head, standing, with a double-jack—the
knife to somersault twice on its. journey
before its blade dug into the ground. One
kid of my acquaintance could go through
the whole programme—and one only.
Our claim that he was “the champion of
Sydney” was probably right.
* * * *
“Brolga”: That pistol that misfired
(B. 11/2/’4B) recalls a non-military
weapon that didn’t misfire. A stock-
man who’d been celebrating his re-
turn to civilisation called for a meal in
a Camooweal (Q.) cafe. The goat and/or
galah wasn’t up to the standard he ex-
pected in that big city, and he began to
abuse the two waitresses. They called on
some of the local lads for help. Seeing
half a dozen youths approaching with the
intention of tossing him out on his ear,
the stockman produced a long-barrelled
Colt revolver and began to stir his tea
with it. The youths hung back for a
couple of minutes, then one called “Come
on. It’s not loaded.” “ ’Course it’s
loaded,” announced the stockman, and
he demonstrated the fact by squeezing
the trigger without taking the muzzle out
of the teacup. A second later he was
alone in the cafe,

“Uco”; “When a member of the
House of Commons wishes to resign his
seat,” said the radio quiz-master, “he
applies for the Stewardship of the Chil-
tern Hundreds. How does an Australian
member resign?” The contestant didn’t
know the answer, but he apparently knew
his Australian politicians. “By dying or
becoming stark, staring mad,” he re-
plied.

. “Blauber”: Touching “Clooter’s” re-
sentment (B. 18/2/’4B) at the spectacle of
a nation’s transport being thrown into
confusion because some wharflaborer
can’t get a mug of the nut-brown; that
excuse doesn’t seem tenable in Mel-
bourne. For the annual picnic of the
Waterside Workers’ Federation 40
18-gallon barrels of beer and six barmen
were transported to the Diamond Creek
Hotel. There was an unfortunate sequel
to this happy function. The same night
thieves broke into the hostelry and
cleaned out the safe, getting away with
£BOO. The thieves were not wharf-
laborers, whose behavior was exemplary,
according to the publican. So it should
have been, with that amount of liquor.
“John Dee”; Talking of beer —we
were, weren’t we? —Australians are ap-
parently the only race who like it re-
frigerated. A Kiwi once told me that he
didn’t know beer temperatures could be
regulated by refrigeration until he visited
Australia on his way to the Middle East.
And he hadn’t tasted beer as cold after
he left Australia. Nor have I. In Dur-
ban during a steaming summer a friend
and I combed the city for a pub in
which a reasonably cold drink could be
had. We discovered the Phoenix, where
a small supply of bottles was kept un-
noticed in a dilapidated ice-box. Just
as we settled down to steady drinking a
Durbanite shoved us apart and asked the
barmaid for “One warm beer, please.”
* * * *
“Ekmiv”: Things in the after-care
home were dull despite radios, cards,
chessboards, handwork, library and
facilities for sport. “Yes, we’ve done
everything we can think of for the
patients’ interest and enjoyment,” sighed
Matron as she escorted the new young
doctor around. “But there seems to be
something lacking.” “I know,” Doc.
grinned. “No s.-p. in the place.” Missing
link’s been found, Matron says now.

“Pawang”: One of the remarkable
things about that remarkable woman
Helen Keller, the deaf-and-blind author
who will shortly visit Australia, is the
vividness of her descriptions of natural
scenery. One of her admirers recently
stated that they indicated that she had
extra apprehension, a sixth sense de-
veloped by her deficiency in the others.
This seems to me a misunderstanding.
Color is the one thing of which the blind
person can have no knowledge. He may
know that blue has a certain wavelength
and red another, but there is no way in
which he can differentiate between them.
With the colors themselves he has no
acquaintance. Then how explain the
vividness of Miss Keller’s descriptions of
Nature? They can only be memories
of the descriptions of other people. This
is not surprising. Literature is full of
thousands of descriptions of tropical
sunsets, storms at sea and other things
with which the writers had no acquaint-
ance.
* * * *
“Lim-Limbu”: There have been many
disappointments in civilian life for the
ex-serviceman, but in New Guinea a
soldier’s dream has come true. A bugler
blows reveille, but we need take no notice.
Administration stations run the flag up
and down each day, and the music of
reveille and retreat is part of our daily
lives. The performers are police boys,
and they blow a clear and mellow note.
THE RUSH FOR THE SPOIL.
With seventy more legislators
To clutter the Canberra show,
To add to our nation’s curators
And pocket their whack of the dough,
Who doubts, when-the curtain arises
For next year’s election turmoil,.
The scramble there’ll be for the prizes,
The rush for the spoil!
Stout fellows, all sorts and conditions,
You’ll find upon every hand
Asserting their dearest ambitions
Are centred on serving the land,.
And calling on Heaven to witness
How far they stand out of the mob
In their patent and palpable fitness
For that sort of job.
Trade-union Pooh-Bahs one may image
As hopefully heading the rush,
But some must go down in the scrimmage,
Be tramped underfoot in the crush.
State rejects will doubtless endeavor
To put in a claim and a call
For notice. But dash it! there’ll never
Be seats for them all.
To be preached unto death by wild curates
(A notable saying) is not
A fate that with me or with you rates
As at all a desirable lot.
But, brother, there’s worse may be waiting
In the prospect next year of the steps
They’ll take, all the braying and prating
Wild Cleons will use for, debating
Who crave Senatorial rating
Or yearn to be Reps.

“Pitt Street”: Every male—and pretty
well every female —eye within range was
fixed on the expensively-clad girl who
boarded the tram. Her gilded hair was
piled high in an elaborate coiffure, her
svelte black bolero moulded shoulders
and hips, a green silk blouse and gold
necklet embellished her frontal works,
the “new-look” tartan skirt revealed no-
thing less than nylons on her shapely
legs. She had the appearance and bear-
ing of one to whom money mattered
nothing and who was merely taking a
tram ride in order to break the monotony
of being driven about in her own limou-
sine, Five men offered her a seat. She
thanked them with a gracious smile and
accepted one. The tram guard came for-
ward, obviously impressed by the honor
of serving such a one. He waited in
silence. The speaking eyes lifted to him,
the beautiful mouth opened. “Hi ya,
Jack,” she shrilled. “Why wasnya at
the dawgs lars ni’? Me an’ Perce looked
everywhere.” Even the tram groaned as
it resumed its journey.

“Hie”: Issued regularly by the Aus-
tralian Information Bureau in New York,
“News Release” could be an excellent
tourist snare for this country. Badly
baited, however, a recent issue claimed
that in 1924, “a year which offered parti-
cularly favorable opportunities for mental
inter-planetary communication,” one of
our citizens received his first coded mental
message from Mars during a “lunch-time
period of concentration”:
I saw little men flying around in cigar-
shaped machines which are propelled by
a suction principle the landscape was
artificially colored to make it more pleasing
to the eye. My most vivid impression
was that the Martians wanted to share with
us their secret for abolishing war. Be-
cause they have no wars, life for them is
a whirlwind of sheer delight—galvanic and
riotous.
I wonder what’ hardheaded American
businessmen thought of that? And how
much did it cost in dollars to bring such
piffle before the American eve?
“ Don't Worry — I'll probably be back before you!”
“K.”: Victorian shorthand-writers com-
plain that their ranks are steadily dimin-
ishing, that no new blood is coming
forward, and “we are a dying race.” The
plaint was forthcoming after representa-
tions that shorthand staffs in Common-
wealth and State departments in Victoria
are—short-handed.
“The Rotney”; Nobody is
quicker than the modern reporter
at smelling a mystery. A Sydney
one caught a suspicious odor
when an art-union was drawn in
his city the other day, the
winner of two houses and a
car being announced as a resi-
dent of North Richmond. Flav-
ing scoured the N.S.W. and
Victorian Richmonds in vain,
the paper came out with the
headline, “Won Houses But
Can’t Be Found,” alleged that
neither the person nor the street
were known, and left its readers
to assume that another lottery
scandal was about to —er —hit
the front page. Radio and the
rival daily had already located
the man, the street and the
suburb, in Adelaide. But then,
what would you? To some
Sydney reporters Adelaide is a sort of
large village in a “hillbilly” State—prob-
ably few of them even know that it has
suburbs.
♦ * * ♦
“Minbess”: I must query “Bo’s” refer-
ence (B. 18/2/’4B) to a high “F” by
Caruso. The highest note taken by
Caruso in any of his recordings is a “D”
Flat at the end of “Cujus Animam” from
Rossini’s “Stabat Mater.” This note is
undoubtedly falsetto, so surely an “F”
above top “C” would have been out of
the question for that artist. Gigli, in his
rendition of the same excerpt, omits
entirely the “D” Flat, substituting a “B”
Flat. Tauber’s repertoire does not in-
clude any of the famous top-“C” arias
which are all of the Italian or French
schools. Any note of Tauber’s above
“B” Flat is invariably taken in falsetto,
the volume of which is exaggerated by
shrewd microphone technique. I’ll admit
Jussi Bjorling does take a full-throated
“D” Flat in his rendering of “Cujus
Animam.” Stratospheric tenors of the
present-day are few, and include Joseph
Schmidt —“Wenn du Treulos Bist” —and
Nino Martini. The two famous high
“Ds” of Herbert Ernst Groh in
“Friends Take Heed to My Story”,, are
without doubt falsetto.

“C. 8.”: There is encouragement for
the consumptive in the history of a young
medical student now at Austin Hospital,
near Melbourne. Four years ago he was
about to enter his finals when he got t.b.
of the spine and wrist. After nine months
in a sanatorium, more months at
home and seven months in a public
hospital he was admitted to the
Austin and put in plaster. A year
ago it was decided to make him the first
patient to be treated with streptomycin.
After four or five days of the injections
his temperature became normal and
stayed so. After four months he was
allowed to come out of the plaster an
hour weekly. Now he is a normal cot-
case and has been up for three weeks.
He expects soon to resume his inter-
rupted med. course.

“Clooter”: A vast amount of radio
blah and literary ballyhoo is still flooding
the world about the so-called rights of
the common man and the alleged need to
protect or save or perform some other
sort of kindness for “the little people.”
Yet it is always the uncommon man or
the big people who
have to recognise
and define the rights
or provide the pro-
tection. All the ad-
vances in the march
of human progress
are initiated or im-
pelled by uncommon
people, mostly in-
dividuals themselves

par a lively few.

why history is

martyrs only after a
century or so has

mon crowd has been

ing at. It gives me the mullygrubs to

“Le Glorieux”; Reports of a fire on
board the 7000-ton Willesden in South
Australian waters set me wondering
whether this was the Willesden I used to
know. If so, she is a remarkable old
vessel. When I first met her she was
owned by the London Steamship Co., a
famous line of tramp-steamers—l was
serving my time as an apprentice with
the company when I saw her in Cardiff
in 1909. She was not then by any means
a new ship. I next saw her three years
later in a small coaling port near Hako-
date, on the north of Hokkaido, Japan.
To my amazement I discovered she was
still afloat and flying the same house flag
in 1936 or 1937 when she passed Lady
Elliott Island, off the Queensland coast,
where I was temporarily stationed. I
later heard of her in Thursday Island.

“Craiser”: So the central committee of
the Russian Communist party has con-
demned the musical works 6i Prokofieff,
Khacbaturyan, Shebalan, Popov and
Myaskovsky. It appears that their crea-
tive work “provides the most graphic ex-
amples of formalistic perversions and
anti-democratic tendencies in music ; they
renounce melody and produce neuro-
pathic combinations which transform
music into a chaotic maze of sound, and
they reek of the contemporary modern-
istic bourgeois spirit.” One can’t help
being struck by the similarity between
these Moscow outbursts and those of
some of our own Critical boys with
Leftist leanings. Especially is this so
with regard to painting. The amusing
thing about it is that what the Moscow
lads mean by “bourgeois” is precisely
what our local heroes imply by “Leftist.”
What they call “bourgeois” the Moscow
sages apparently would call democratic.
A Leftist acquaintance was telling me of
the enormous strides made in art in the
Soviet Union. Asked for examples, he
showed me a book of reproductions of a
Moscow exhibition. I expected to
see something similar to the work of our
own young men of the modernist persua-
sion, but was shown a collection of
thoroughly conventional academic pic-
tures that would have got into an R.A.
show of 50 years back. If some of our
more revolutionary young artists went to
Russia they would stand a fair chance of
being liquidated.

“V. Cluse”: Environment is a peculiar
thing. Our guest was a woman from a
western Sydney suburb. About the only
noise that disturbs our street is the roar
of a plane’s engines arising from or
alighting upon the near-by waters of the
flying-boat base, and we hear the noise-
loud enough in all conscience but never
lasting more than three or four minutes
—only when certain winds force the big
planes our way. Our guest was horribly
put out. “Oh, I couldn’t.endure that!”
she asserted. Several weeks later we re-
turned her visit. Electric-trams grind
past less than 50ft. from her front-door
all day and half the night, electric-trains
add to the din and there is a constant
stream of road vehicles.

Jim O’Keeffe: Applause for “Micker-
man” (B. 18/2/’4B) and his attack on the
verbal monstrosities officialdom perpe-
trates in its striving after effect. But
bureaucrats aren’t the only offenders;
the urge manifests itself also in grandiose
commercial blather. There is a fine ex-
ample in a book of instructions on an
expensive American “automobile.” It
gives involved and jargon-laden instruc-
tions for “dis-assembling the final rear
transmission assembly units.” The cor-
responding section of the pamphlet issued
for a similarly-priced English car gives
directions for “taking out the back axles.”
Perhaps the public-service use of the
philological gymnastics is all part of a
socialist plan for swamping everybody’s
intelligence in bureaucratic practice.
♦ * * ♦
“Ceg”: “Taswegian’s” par, re tele-
phones (B. 11/2/’4B). I called one day at
some legal chambers. Young Mr.
Jaggers, recently admitted to the Bar, was
sitting in his very new-looking office, ex-
pectantly waiting his first brief. I saw
him grab the desk phone as I entered
and, nodding to me to wait a moment,
proceeded to conduct a most impressive
conversation. There were ponderous
references, appropriate pauses, and,
generally, he put on a very good act.
Finishing, he hung up and turned to me,
“Sorry to keep you waiting, but I am
engaged on a very important case.” Per-
haps it would have been kinder had I
told him earlier that I was from the
P.M.G.’s department and had called to
connect his phone.

“Lawnstob”: The Apple Island is to
have its permanent State orchestra be-
fore Melbourne, the Tasmanian Govern-
ment having decided to bring in an Act
authorising its formation. Hobart and
Launceston will co-operate in the enter-
prise, which has received the A.B.G.’s
blessing.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
“Mac”: Possible cancer cures (B.
11 /2/’48)? A Dutch family in Kimberley,
South Africa, claims a formula, passed
from generation to generation, for a
preparation said to have effected many
cancer cures. An ointment-like substance,
it is applied to the surface of the diseased
part of the body and causes great pain
while the “cure” is in process, I knew
one man who used the ointment. Some
time after its application it brought to
the surface lumps of apparently can-
cerous tissue. To the best of my know-
ledge he is still living. The same people
have for many years used peach-mould
for treating septic wounds and sores;
surely there’s an analogy here to peni-
cillin.
* ♦ * ♦
“Hamfat”: The telescopic sword or
dagger which once gave realism to such
scenes as those mentioned by “Bo” (B.
4/2/’4B) has vanished from among
theatrical props. Nowadays the victim
stands side-on to the audience ; the sword
that is supposed to split him passes under
his remote arm, and the victim, by an
agonised clutching of the supposedly
stricken part, helps out the illusion. With
the telescopic sword the actor to be spitted
stood almost full-on to the audience so
that it could be thrilled by the sight of
the weapon actually “piercing” his body ;
the apparently-solid bladfe, shutting up
inside itself under pressure, gave a most
realistic touch, especially as the sword-
wielder, immediately on withdrawing it,
wiped the blade on the blood-sponge con-
cealed in the handkerchief he carried in
his other hand. They were very realistic,
those old-time Thespians. Harry Douglas
used to tell me with gusto of the cudgel
with which, as Bill Sykes, he laid out
Nancy in “Oliver Twist,” as produced by
Rignold. At the head of the club was
a split rubber ballinside the ball was
a blood (cochineal) sponge. As Nancy
was bashed about the head the pressure
left great gouts of the “blood.” “My
boy every night women were carried,
fainting, from the theatre, Douglas
assured me. I never doubted him.
THE DAWN OF MAN.
“British archaeologists have discovered evidence of
the existence of man-like beings, about four feet
in height, who made flint tools and hunted on
Norfolk cliffs a million years ago, and seem to have
been developed from a chimpanzee-type of animal.”
They lived upon cliffs by the shores,
They hunted on headlands and capes,
Our long-ago progenitors
Who slowly evolved from the apes.
They flitted, quaint pygmy-like shapes,
Pint-sized prehistorical imps,
Who showed by their jinks and their japes
An intimate kinship with chimps.
They were there, so to speak, on the spot,
A million summers agone.
What havoc it plays, does it not,
With the tales teachers nourished us on
Ere Darwin loosed science upon
Those brittle old Biblical gimps?
They were there and —a sine qua non —
Whom else could they stem from but chimps?
It may be there’s little that hints
Of men in those primitive souls
Who fashioned their weapons from flints
And hunted the badgers and voles.
Yet they filled all unknowingly roles
At which it’s intriguing to glimpse:
They were links, those diminutive drolls
Between you and me and the chimps.
In minds mediocre mayhap,
In stature suggestive of shrimps,
Of culture they hadn’t a scrap;
Yet they’ve claims to a place on the map
As agents through whom Homo sap.
Emerged, as it were, from the chimps.

Largest thing of its kind in the Southern
Hemisphere, this big holding co. and its
five main operating subsidiaries enjoy a
commanding position in the Australian
tobacco trade. The £11,082,521 of capital
is widely held, mostly in Australia and
to a lesser extent in Maoriland, Britain
and elsewhere, and the scrip is one of
the leaders in the industrial section on
’Change. There are now 6231 names
on the payroll, which totals over
£2,000,000 p.a.; and the group is a
handsome contributor to the public
Treasury. Over £24,750,000, or more than
60 p.c. of gross proceeds from sales of
tobacco and cigarettes, was handed to
the Government last term in import and
excise duties.
Since import duty is paid when leaf is
delivered to the factory and excise be-
fore goods leave the warehouses, a large
amount of capital is tied up in these
prepayments. The Government walks
off with 6yd. of the 10£d. the public pays
for a popular brand of cigarettes and Is.
9yd. of the 2s. at which a popular
brand of tobacco sells, leaving the co.
with 4d. for 10 cigarettes and Is. 2d.
for 2oz of tobacco to cover the cost of
raw materials, manufacture, distribution,
taxation and other overhead as well as
manufacturer’s and retailer’s profits—
the co.’s profits are raided again as divi-
dends in the hands of shareholders.
The downward trend of combined net
earnings of the group since 1940 has
been brought about by rises in taxation,
wages, price of American leaf and costs
generally outstripping the gains from ex-
panding consumption. The following
table, compiled from figures published by
the Commonwealth statistician, helps to
show what has happened:
Consumption. Value Production*

* Value added during manufacture.
The drop in value of output per person
(i.e., value added during manufacture,
excluding cost of raw materials) and the
increasing proportion of that value
gobbled by expanding payroll totals and
other outgo have robbed net earnings of
the buoyancy that normally goes with
bigger turnover.
Output expanded last term, thanks
largely to the half-dozen subsidiary units
set up in country centres in N.S.W. and
Vic. during the previous year to help
overcome the labor problem. Indeed,
production reached a point where aboli-
tion of tobacco rationing was in sight,
when the dollar problem altered the out-
look. But the gap between wage and
other costs and the value of production
continued to widen. So, despite a drop
in the price of American leaf and aboli-
tion of War-time (Co.) Tax, net earn-
ings of the group (after deducting out-
side interests) were £8755 lighter at
£951,403. And that disregards an un-
explained reduction of £6083 in reserves.
The £951,403 covered the pref. div. and
8.9 p.c. on the £9,371,933 of ord. capital,
compared with 9, 8.9, 9, 7.5, 9.3, 9.2 and
10.3 p.c.’ back to 1940. The div, was
kept at 9 p.c., reserves being drawn upon
for £3259 for the purpose.
The immediate outlook suggests a
further recession in earnings. The Gov-
ernment intends to cut imports of
American leaf in 1948-49 by about 50
p.c., while the 40-hour week, additions
to the basic wage and rise in transport,
power and other costs have further in-
creased outgoings. Locally retail quotas
have been already reduced by 10 p.c.,
with further cuts in prospect. Leaf from
the sterling area, notably Southern
Rhodesia, won’t fill the gap caused by
the cut in American supplies, and the cur-
rent crop of Australian leaf is expected
to be smaller than the one on whose heels
it treads. Much will depend upon what
happens in connection with the price of
American leaf, and upon what savings
the management is able to make by
internal adjustments. The chairman gives
no hint that the 9 p.c. div. is likely to
-be interfered with, which suggests the
possibility of substantial savings from in-
ternal adjustments.
Here are consolidated balance-sheet
figures of the group:— '

The year’s reduction of £921,881 in
stocks and contraction of £1,184,517 in
the amount coming to trade creditors,
etc., largely reflect reduced purchases of
American leaf at lower prices. Debtors’
balances were down £237,964 and
£141,979 more was spent on plant than
was written off. Drop in the more or less
liquid surplus (£8,147,260) was £144,224.
The market prices the ords,.at 50s. 3d.
as against 545. 3d. a month or so ago.
At the lo.wer figure the return is 3.6 p.c,
on a 9 p.c. div. basis. The 6\ p.c. prefs.
at 345. 9d. yield 3.7 p.c. Net tangible
cover is £7 6s. lid. prefs., 245. 6d. ords.,
and 4s. 6d. B shares, which rank equally
with the ords. for divs., and, in a wind-
up, in any remaining assets, after re-pay-
ment of oref. and ord. capital.

The business of this well-handled 40-
year-old fire, marine and accident office
is confined to the Commonwealth, and
the co.’s accounts present a sound and
attractive financial picture to both share-
holders and policyholders. The £70,000
of capital is in £1 shares paid to 7s. each,
and it has the support and assistance of
£164,436 of reserves. That means that
the two combined need turn in only a
shade under 3 p.c. to show 10 p.c. on
capital alone, at which rate the div. has
been steady for the last 11 years. Last
term the net return from investments
(£7922, after deducting taxation) covered
the div. with £922 to spare. So, after
sending £lOOO to the staff fund, practically
the whole of the increased underwriting
surplus was available to swell investments
and, of course, the returns therefrom.
Moreover, premium income, which
showed no marked fluctuation during the
war years, has become expansive again.
Gross premiums (£203,650) shot up
£48,114 last term, but an extra £16,843
was re-insured (£58,962), leaving the gain
in net premiums at £31,279:

In the fire section —backbone of under-
writing activities —more business was
gathered at less cost. Marine risks
showed less profit, because of pilfering
during the voyage and on the wharves —
unhealthy evidence of the continued ex-
istence of the blackmarket. Workers’-
compensation results were unsatisfactory,
and motor-vehicle insurance was more so,
despite a lift in premium rates (which
are still well below pre-war levels) on
private cars. Claims for hail damage to
crops were exceptionally heavy, especially
in N. S. Wales. However, the overall loss
rate was £4 14s. p.c. lighter, and a tight
hold was kept upon exes., the larger
business being written at £3 2s. p.c. less
cost. The gain in the underwriting surplus
(£23,309, which includes £lO,OOO added
to the reserve for unexpired risks) was
£13,878, making the net return from all
sources £13,990 stronger at £31,231. That
was 44.6 p.c. on capital, or 30.7 p.c. after
deducting the addition to reserve for un-
expired risks, now £75,000, which is well
in excess of the 40 p.c. usually considered
adequate. *
Assets are a sound lot, worth more than
their book-value, and for the most part
readily realisable:

added since 1939.
Anticipating its benefits, the market
prices the scrip at 245, 6d., at which

For the squatter in western N. S. Wales
and over the border in Queensland,
where this co. has been a runowner for
the last 65 years, the big gamble is with
seasons and prices, and seldom is there
a favorable combination of the two.
When such a happy state of affairs does
occur, as in 1936 and 1937 and again
last year, attractive returns are won. For
the investor, however, scrip in this class
of business is a question of average
rather than immediate return.
Drought and an anaemic wool market
brought losses totalling £137,250 for the
two years to end 1930, and the board
went to its bankers and others for
£151,000-odd in order to save the breed-
ing ewes, rams and young wethers and
help restock the properties. At the same
time a capital deficiency of £112,692
showed up." Shareholders, however, got
back into the picture in 1935, and have
remained there since, except in 1938, when
seasons and prices were both unkind.
Over the last 13 years divs. have averaged
a shade over 7 p.c., and when the books
last closed the whole of the capital and
£35,557 besides were represented by
things that could be touched with a stick,
and there was £136,862 in the bank and
in Commonwealth stock.
Last year good rains fell on all the
co.’s properties from February onwards,
as the following table giving the average

(near Gulargambone, N.S.W.) 18.81
inches over 25 years.
High prices were received for wool
and livestock. For the six months to
end December last, Australian greasy
averaged £45 19s. 6d. a bale, compared
with an average of £3O 19s. 6d. for the
preceding 12 months and £2O 3s. 9d. for
the year before that. So, although the
co. put fewer sheep over the board, the
wool cheque was bigger:

Sale of fewer livestock (14,219 sheep,
down 7437 sheep) turned in more, too
(£31,567, up £16,020). After allowing
for taxation (£32,248, up £8639) and
depreciation (£4080) the net result was
£31,900 stronger at £56,812, second-best
showing since the beginning of this cen-
tury. It was 23.3 p.c. on capital as
against 10.2, 3.9, 6, 10.4, 10.1, 6.9, 9.8
and 1.2 p.c, back 'to 1939. AlO p.c.
bonus was added to the 6.6 p.c. div.,
making 16.6 p.c. for the year.
As for the current term, the immedi-
ate outlook is for another good season,
the co.’s properties are well stocked,
thanks to satisfactory lambing, and prices
for both wool and livestock remain at
high levels. Last year 3202 acres free-
hold from Tondeburine were sold to
returned servicemen, arid the Govern-
merit intends to resume the balance of
this property (about 25,000 acres) dur-
ing 1948. The co. is endeavoring to buy
another property, details of which have
not yet been announced.

The strong holding of cash, etc, (up

not likely to be asked to assist in pur-
chase and stocking of the new property.
The more or less liquid surplus (£148,739)
was £50,229 stronger than at the previous
balance.
Last recorded sale of the f.-p. 30s.
shares was at 375. early this year. At
375, the return would be 5.3 p.c. on an
average 6.6 p.c. distribution.

Bulolo Gold Dredging (New
Guinea) continues to make
steady progress with rehabilita-
tion of plant and equipment.
Of the original eight dredges on
the property, four operated
throughout January last, and a
fifth set in on January 10. Dur-
ing the month the lot handled
764,000 c.y. for 70570 z. fine gold,
an average of o.lBsdwt. per yard.
For the seven months to end
January 4,937,000 c.y. were
turned over for 51,8580 z. fine
gold, an average of o.2lodwt.
per yard. Operating profit from
two dredges from Feb. 20, 1947,
when digging was resumed, to
end May, 1947, was 363,273
Canadian dollars. Abrogation
of the Australian Gold Tax as
from September 20, 1947, will
benefit the co.’s earnings to the
extent of 17s. (Aus.) per fine
ounce. Dividends are expected
to flow again during the last half
of 1948, but until more is known
about operating costs it is diffi-
cult'to say what the rate will
be ; it is unlikely that it will
equal the pre-war rate of three
dollars per five-dollar share.
Gravel reserves are estimated at
128,000,000 c.y. for dredging
and 21,000,000 c.y. for hydrauhc-
ing. Two new areas were re-
cently acquired, but scout-drilling
of one has been unsatisfactory.

of the English 25 p.c. tax on dis-
tributed profits, it is unlikely
that the final div. can be kept
at last year’s figure of 50 p.c.

ling of the workings had given

turn of 6s. 3d. a ton. Since
then 3900 tons have been treated
for a yield of 1550 z., equal to
Bs. 7d. a ton. A recent official
report said that the throughput
was averaging 20 tons per
operating hour. It is now stated
to be “substantially greater.”
The market still has doubts
about the success of the venture.

Burbidge Gold reports that
last year’s mine operations at

Blackett recently reported that
there were large deposits of pay-
able laterite on the co.’s blocks,
but for economical treatment the
throughput must be raised to
6000 tons a month. On this
basis a profit of about £l5OO a
month could be expected.

THE AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT COMPANY
Chairman’s Address at Annual General Meeting of Proprietors.
At the annual meeting of proprietors of The Australian Gas Light Company held on
February 26, 1948, in Sydney, the Chairman of Directors, 0. G. Yiekery, Esq., said:
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Since the last annual meeting there
have been several changes in the personnel
of the Board. You will remember that
last year reference was made to the re-
tirement of Sir Samuel Cohen from the
position of Chairman of Directors, and
to the invaluable services he had rendered
to the Company during his occupancy pf
that position. It was with much regret,
on account of his health, that Sir Samuel
resigned from the Board in the early part
of the year. Your Directors subsequently
invited Mr. Allen T. Anderson, who is with
us today, to fill the vacancy thus created.
Later in the year, Mr. F. B. Spencer,
Chairman of Directors, also found it neces-
sary to resign from the Board as from
December 31, 1947, on account of the de-
mands on his time by other organisations
of an international character with which
he is associated and because each year it
will be necessary for him to spend con-
siderable time abroad. Mr. Spencer joined
the Board in October, 1939, and was
Deputy Chairman from October, 1941, to
January, 1947, when he assumed the posi-
tion of Chairman. The benefit of his wide
business experience will be greatly missed
by his colleagues, and I wish to take this
opportunity of placing on record appreci-
ation of the untiring manner in which he
devoted himself to the service of the Com-
pany and the community whilst a member
of the Board.
Mr. G. Gordon Russell was invited to
fill the vacancy so created, and he also
is with us today.
During the past year increases in costs
have occurred on an unprecedented scale,
and I do not think that many of us en-
visaged twelve months ago that costs
would rise to the extent which they have,
particularly during the latter half of the
year. The level of wages at the end of
the year was approximately 20 p.c. above
that at the beginning of the year, due in
the main to increases in the basic wage
and variations of awards; also during the
twelve months the cost of coal, which is our
basic raw material, increased by an average
of 7/- per ton or approximately 25 p.c.
These are but two examples of increases
in costs which have to be met. There are
many others, and in total they have
reached a magnitude which is beyond the
absorptive capacity of our increasing sales
of gas and by-products. During the year
the changing relationship between costs
and sales was kept constantly under ob-
servation, always with the hope that in-
creases in selling prices could be avoided,
but when the rate at which costs were
ascending took on an added acceleration
bpwards the end of the year 1947, it be-
came apparent to your directors that some
increases in selling prices were inevitable
if the financial stability of the Company
were to be preserved. Had the impact
of post-war adjustments in costs been
less severe and- more closely related to ex-
panding demand for the Company s pro-
ducts, then less disturbance of selling
prices would have been necessary.
Immediately after advice of heavy in-
creases ■in the cost of coal had been re-
ceived in November last, it was decided to
apply for permission to increase selling
prices of gas. Having been officially ad-
vised that control in this matter had re-
verted to the State authorities from the
Prices Branch, application was made for
a Board of Enquiry as provided for by
the Gas and Electricity Act. In December,
however, the Company was advised that
control of prices for gas had not reverted
o the State authorities and that our appli-
cation should be directed to the Prices
Branch. Immediate application was then
made to the Prices Branch, and, as you
are aware, new prices were approved and
brought into operation on 19th February,
1948. I would like to say here, that our
application was dealt with efficiently and
expeditiously considering what was in-
volved in the way of extensive checks and
examinations of our submissions.
The new prices for gas involve a maxi-
mum increase of one-twentieth of a penny
per gas unit, which is equal to approxi-
mately eleven and one-half per cent, on
the previously existing maximum price.
The promotional features of our rate struc-
ture are, however, unaltered. In this con-
nection I would like to make it clear that
the increases which have been granted
are no more than necessary to meet in-
creases in costs which have already
occurred, or which are in sight, after
taking into account anticipated expansion
of sales. Thus, if additional increases in
costs of any magnitude occur, further
applications for adjustments of prices will
be necessary. I would like to mention
here that the last increase in selling prices
of gas was made in 1987, that is apart
from the special increase made in 5.942
for the purpose of meeting costs in-
curred in taking measures to ensure the
control of gas supply in the event of
enemy action affecting Sydney. This in-
crease was removed in 1944 when the costs
of such work had been met.
In respect of selling prices for by-pro-
ducts separate applications were made to
the Prices Branch during September and
November, and two increases were ap-
proved.
Last year reference was made to the
construction of a new Carburetted Water
Gas Unit which was then proceeding. I
am pleased to say that this unit will be
ready for service before the forthcoming
winter. In order to meet further antici-
pated demands for gas it has been de-
cided to instal another unit, making seven
In all, and to make substantial additions
to No. 6 Retort House. It is hoped that
these two units of plant will commence
production by the end of 1950 or early in
1951. Consideration is also being given
to other additional plant which will be
required arising out of these extensions of
gasmaking plant, such as for handling
coal and treating by-products. During
the year our inability to complete the re-
pairs to our gasmaking plant, owing to
shortage of labour, caused us some anxiety
in maintaining full supplies of gas. In
this regard the outlook for the current
year is not as bright as could be desired;
this is due to the continued labour short-
age, to which has been added delays in
the deliveries of materials necessary to
complete our repair work.
During the year extensions to the Com-
pany’s distribution system exceeded those
made in any year since 1928. Approxi-
mately 68 miles of new mains were laid,
together with 28 miles of service pipes.
Extensions arising from the activities of
the Housing Commission were a factor
contributing to the establishment of this
record. Supplies of main and service pipe
were better than during 1946, but still
fall short of requirements. Additional
earthmoving equipment has been obtained,
and this will enable mainlaying projects
to be executed with greater rapidity and
efficiency. In order to keep pace with
extensions in the reticulation system and
the growth in demand for gas, additional
boosters are on Order for Alexandria and
Gordon gasholder stations. In addition,
the initial contract has been let for the
erection of a gasholder in the vicinity of
Granville Railway Station, and land has
been acquired at Bass Hill, in the Banks-
town area, for the erection of a further
gasholder. It has been a source of pleasure
to the Board that, despite the difficulties
which have been encountered, the Com-
pany has been, able to play its part well
in the post-war development of the Sydney
metropolitan area. .
After reviewing estimated requirements
of funds to finance extensions of plant
and sales of appliances, and acting under
authority conferred by a resolution of the
Proprietors made on February 18, l"* s /’
your directors decided in the latter hall
of the year to apply to Capital Issues
Control for consent to issue debentures to
the value of £1,250,000 bearing interest
at the rate of 3J p.c. Consent was given,
and an arrangement was made for the
whole of the amount to be provided by a
single lender. It is part of the arrange-
ment that the Company may draw upon
the total amount, from time to time, ac-
cording to its requirements. The first
amount of £312,000 was obtained during
December, and appears in the accounts
before you. This action ensures the avaiia-
bility of finance for the very extensive
programme of works which it is necessary
for the Company to undertake during the
next two to three years, some items of
which have been referred to in this and
previous addresses. It is appropriate that,
while dealing with the subject of capital,
1 should also give you, as a matter of
interest, some little-known facts regarding
the manner in which the share capital is
Held. At December 31 last there were
7870 shareholders. Of these 7080 held
200 shares or less, and in consequence can
only receive at maximum rates of
dend £72 or less per annum on their in-
vestment in the Company. At the other
end of the scale there were only 20 share-
holders who received more than £lOOO
dividend qn their investment. These 20
were almost exclusively trustee companies
and similar organisations which make in-
vestments on behalf of numerous indi-
viduals and estates. Regarding voting
power oi shareholders at meetings, the
Gas and Electricity Act, Section 34, speci-
fically sets out the ratios which must be
observed as between shares and votes.
Such simple facts as these explode the
suggestion so frequently made by the unin-
formed, that tfi Company is owned or
controlled by a few wealthy investors.
It will also be of interest to you that
for 1947 the relationship between capital
employed and sales of gas was the same
as in 1917. Amongst other things this
demonstrates that improvements in the
efficiency of plant have offset the effect of
rises in price levels, and that investment
of funds in the Company has remained in
direct relationship with expanding sales.
The increase in customers during the
year was 5400, the total number served
being now 311,600. tVhile much of this
increase has been due to the activities of
the Housing Commission, it also reflects
the growth in the number of houses being
erected by individuals. The increase is
not as great as tae of those which were
experienced in pre-war years, but con-
sidered in conjunctionf with actual homes
completed in the Company’s territory dur-
ing the year, it is a satisfactory one and
reflects the continued popularity of gas.
I would like to mention here that our
relations with the Housing Commission,
and builders generally, are most cordial.
Sales of gas, by-products and appli-
ances have all shown considerable im-
provements over operations for 1946. _ The
quantity of gas sold was 1726 million
units, being an increase of 8.4 p.c. over
1946. Sales of coke and breeze increased
by approximately 12,000 tons, and sales of
tar and tar products increased by approxi-
mately 400,000 gallons.
The production of domestic gas appli-
ances during 1947 was much below that
forecast at the beginning of the year.
Supply difficulties have been such that
the major proportion of production of
appliances has been absorbed by new
building activities, leaving the large re-
placement market still unsatisfied. The
Company, however, was able to secure a
greater proportion of the available produc-
tion which has resulted in a corresponding
increase in its merchandising figures.
Despite the supply difficulty it is pleas-
ing to note that the turnover on the sales
of domestic appliances for the past year
is the highest ever recorded.
Gas refrigeration has maintained its
popularity with our domestic customers,
although in the case of some models un-
satisfied demands are considerable, and
further large-scale business is envisaged
during the forthcoming year. During the
year two additional gas refrigerators have
been introduced, thereby widening the se-
lection to five types.
Agents for British manufacturers of
gas ranges and fires have advised that
these appliances are now available for
Australia, and that early shipments will be
forthcoming. This coupled with evidence
of increased production by local manufac-
turers indicates that good trading results
mav be anticipated during the current year.
During December your directors were
very pleased to be able to invite the Hon.
Mr. J. J. Cahill, Minister for Public
Works and Local Government, to bpen the
canteen which has been provided for em-
ployees at Mortlake Works. The com-
pletion of this canteen marks another step
iq* the programme of improvements in
amenities for employees which it is in-
tended to carry out as the availability of
labour and materials permits, and I am
sure you will be pleased to learn that this
canteen is proving most popular with the
employees, who make full use of its
facilities.
The nett profit for the year is
£289,902/3/7, together with the amount
of £138,104/5/5 brought forward from
1946, makes available for distribution a
total sum of £428,006/9/-.
An interim dividend for the first half
of 1947 of 3 p.c. amounting to £145,800
having been paid in August last, the
sum remaining for distribution is
£282,206/9/-. A final dividend of 3 p.c.
for the second half of 1947 is now recom-
mended, and which will absorb £145,800,
leaving a balance to be carried forward
of £136,406/9/-. , it
In giving you this summary of the
year’s operations I desire, in conclusion,
to express the directors’ appreciation of
the contribution which the Management
and employees have made towards the
splendid results achieved during the year
despite all its difficulties. The year was
one of intense activity, and the senior
officers of the Company particularly de-
serve the fullest commendation for the
manner in which they have discharged
their responsibilities.
I now move;—
“That the Statement of Accounts for
the past year be received, that the Report
of the Directors be adopted, and that
this meeting do order and determine that a
dividend of 3 p.c. be paid for the half-

Gold at $ll5 an Ounce!
According to last week’s
cables, on the Paris Bourse
United States gold coins were
changing hands at the equiva-
lent of one gold dollar to 3.3
paper dollars. If this is a true
open-market rate it means that,
instead of the $35 an ounce paid
by the U.S. Treasury for fine
gold, the real price is more like
$ll5 an ounce.
It has already been reported
that Australian gold has been
selling for £3O an ounce in
Singapore, against the fixed price
of £lO 15s. 3d. in the Com-
monwealth. Converted at
$3.20 to the £ Australian, that is
the equivalent of $96 an ounce ;
but the open-market rate lor
Australian pounds in the United
States is more like $2.50, which
means about $75 an ounce. It
would clearly pay the Singapore
buyer to hand over £3O an
ounce for Australian gold and
send it to the Paris Bourse.
But he might do even better
if he sold it to the Moslem
countries. It was noted during
the war, when the American
forces invaded Morocco, that
the only money which really
helped in dealing with the
natives were golden eagles. And
golden sovereigns spoke a per-
suasive diplomatic language on
the Continent during*' the period
of the occupation.
Present high prices being paid
for gold may be partly a reflec-
tion of the scarcity of the metal
under present conditions, partly
a reflection of conditions in the
countries offering the price. The
United States holds over two-
thirds of the world’s stocks of
monetary gold, with the British
Commonwealth and Russia run-
ning next, a long behind,
there are no free gold-markets
in any country possessing
enough gold to deal in it on a
large and unrestricted scale.
But it is perfectly plain that.
even if the metal were being
more widely dealt in, it would
not sell at the rate of 35 U.S.
paper dollars to the ounce, which
is the figure at which the United
States Treasury buys it. It is
the desperate need for dollar
goods rather than paper dollars
which results! in the steady flow
of gold to New York to be sold
at a bargain price.
United States official, holdings
of gold have risen from the
equivalent of 14,511 million
paper dollars ($35 to the fine
ounce) in 1938 to $22,294 mil-
lion in October last. And the
flow continues as fast as the
metal is mined—perhaps a little
faster. The one-way traffic has
increased since the war, partly
because, in a world whose total
output of goods has fallen, the
productivity of the United States
has increased.
Shares Firmer
Last week was an “up” week
in the up-and-down sharemarket
performance seen since the break
of about a month ago. There
were good rallies in most leading
stocks, B.H.P. touching 575. in
Sydney again, after falling to
under 555., but the closing figure
for the week was 565. 6d. Tooth
changed hands at 795., and Felt
and Textiles ords. at 63s. —a
large issue of 4 p.c. prefs. is
forecast in this case. Barrier
mines were also firmer.
Trading activity in nearly all
industries is still high, there is
still a strong demand for addi-
tional capital, and investment
and spending funds in the hands
of the people are at a peak level.
After new issues are taken up
later this year the market may
steady for many stocks, and in-
vestors may temporarily discover
that they have found employ-
ment for much of their surplus
funds. But these paper-money
funds are being accumulated all
the time under present financial
and industrial policy at a
greater rate than consumer
goods and capital goods are
being created.
Production costs are rising,
but so is demand. A political
showdown on the question of
rising costs seems to be in the
offing,
Price-subsidies
The Federal Government, ac-
cording to Mr. Chifley, is going
to continue paying subsidies out
of Budget revenue (taxes) on
potatoes, tea, milk, woollen
manufactures, coastal-shipping
freights, coal and some other
items, but not necessarily on
every item now subsidised. He
expects subsidies to cost the
Government £4O million to £5O
million this year.
< In the Budget-estimates pre-
sented in September last year
the cost of “price-stabilisation
subsidies” was reckoned at £l9
million, while “assistance to
primary production”—including
superphosphate and jute-pro-
ducts subsidies—were put at £7
million. Whether the latter items
are included in the latest total
or not, it is obvious that the cost
of all subsidies has risen very
steeply this year, partly because
of higher costs following in-
creased wages and the 40-hour
week, and partly because of the
higher cost of wool increasing
the call for assistance in keeping
the price of suitings, knitted
goods, etc., down.
But even after the large
growth in subsidy costs, the Gov-
ernment is not meeting more
than a small fraction of the costs
arising from increased wages.
In other years any increases in
the basic wage were recouped
out of the payroll tax by the
employer, but this practice was
abandoned in May, 1947, and
all the rises have since gone into
prices or have been borne by
industry.
Fares and freights of nearly
all kinds have risen, and still
Government transport services
are in a bad way. Nor has the
40-hour week so far shown that
it is bringing greater trade-union
satisfaction in several very big
industries. Nothing that the
Federal Government has done,
and no Arbitration Court award,
since the war started, has as yet
brought to this country any
promise of a real rise in living
standards. It will only come,
obviously,, when the vicious ele-
ments in trade-unionism and the
organised Communist treachery
are brought into the ring and
beaten.
There. are strong vested in-
terests within trade-unionism
now dictating to the Chifley Gov-
ernment who mean no good to
the Australian democracy as a
whole. And until normal eco-
nomic forces are allowed■, to
function again within industry
and deal with synthetic anoma-
lies our economy will still be
out of balance, still at the mercy
of monetary inflation, costs in-
flation and industrial anarchy.
Industrial discipline must again
become a part-responsibility of
employers, and Canberra “con-
trols”—including price-control
must be abandoned as soon
as possible. The real extent of
our inflation and industrial re-
gression can only be temporarily
disguised by artificial controls,
and while they are disguised they
tend to grow in extent. The
United States is the only country
in the world to reach a position
where its output is greater than
before the war —and it has
abandoned price-control.
In the hands of Canberra
“Labor,” price-controls and the
like become weapons of totali-
tarianism.
Maoriland Woodpulp
Canberra’s hint to New
Zealand to get busy on news-
print-production is a warm
breeze to Maoriland and Aus-
tralian shareholders who have
millions of hard-earned savings
tied up in M.L. softwood forests
Grab this , Spike — We're in luck tonight !”
from which they haven’t
drawn a cent in divs. A news-
print industry would be a god-
send to M.L. no less than to
newspaper-owners scratching for
newsprint that grows dearer as
dollar funds dwindle. When
production gets into its stride
and weeklies “down-
under” will be able to snap their
fingers at Americans. But will
Americans care? There’s a
bigger American demand than
lumbermen and mills can cope
with. Hungry presses on both
sides of the Tasman could eat
up 400,000 tons of newsprint a
year, and N.Z. should be able
to produce a big share of that
when it gets going. A climate
that means beanstalk conditions
for pine forests, with water re-
sources and power, are M.L.’s
assets for this new venture. Its
handicaps are sky-high costs,
lack of labor, rigid price-con-
trols, crushing taxes and a
meddling Government. If M.L
can get over these hurdles it will
have something more tempting
than foodstuffs to offer Aus-
tralia, and trade might be a bit
less lopsided. Something will
have to be done about a quarter-
million acres of pines growing
at the rate of more than a ship-
load a day, and this seems one
of the best ideas yet.

LONDON AIRMAIL
From HERBERT HOLMAN
Wages
Towards the end of 1947,
when the abolition of the basic
petrol ration was known to be
certain, almost every British car-
owner felt he had a just claim
to special consideration —for
business reasons, perhaps, or he
may have had an aged relative
whom he could not readily visit
by rail, a house far from the
shops, children to be taken to
school; or he may even have
felt that his health needed a
whiff of country air at week-
ends.
Quite likely his application
was turned down ; but by then
he had learned more of the tricky
technique of form-filling and
made a second attempt, this
time with greater cunning.
Truly, when something is hard
to get you want it all the more.
It is not surprising then, that,
within a few days of the publica-
tion of the Government White
Paper dealing with costs, prices
and the pegging-down of wages,
the most noticeable reaction was
the rush to put forward claims
for more money. Delegates
from some 40 trade-unions,
representing over 3,000,000
workers, were soon pressing their
claims.
One reason given is that em-
ployers will hide behind the
Government pronouncement;
another is that “to freeze wages
while the cost of living continues
to rise would only lead to in-
dustrial disturbances” ; a third
section gives no reason at all,
baldly stating that it will “pro-
ceed with wages claims in spite
of the White Paper.” The com-
monest excuse is that negotia-
tions have been proceeding for
so long that they cannot now be
broken off.
The plain fact is that, if every
worker had an increase of a few
shillings a week, in a very short
time he would be worse off than
he was before. It is not an issue
that has been squarely faced by
the trade-union leaders, even
though they now say they are
falling in line.
The White Paper was received
by the City, the Opposition,
economists and non-political in-
dustrialists with a rather weary
satisfaction. These realists have
known for too long that the
only hope for economic sal-
vation lay in hard work and
low costs —not in illusory pros-
perity. In making statements
such as the one asking workers
“not to press for wage in-
creases” Government leaders
show only lack of realism.
We are reminded of similar
appeals 12 months ago, during
that worst-ever winter. The then
Minister of Fuel put the nation
—a mere 47,000,000 souls —on
its honor not to use gas or elec-
tricity during certain hours.
When a child came indoors,
chilled to the bone and crying
bitterly/ his mother thought of
Mr. Shinwell, but not in the
sense of keeping a promise. And
junior certainly didn’t go with-
out his hot drink and warm fire.
When the cost of living is ris-
ing it is entirely human for
people to ask for higher wages,
especially if they are being told
to work harder.
It would seem more sensible
if the Government itself gave a
lead, first by pruning its own ex-
penses, and, secondly, by a more
resolute grappling with rising
prices. It has largely contributed
to inflation by its own purchase-
tax. Although this is intended
to dissuade people from buying
luxuries that they don’t need, in
practice the tax merely gives the
spiral another twirl, A house-
hold can somehow struggle
along without a television set and
silver-plate (125 p.c. tax), but it
needs hardware and ironmon-
gery and cutlery (50 p.c. tax)
and clothing ‘and footwear
(33| p.c. tax). Moreover, the
knowledge that prices will tend
to rise is in itself an incentive
to buy.
After this the trade-union
leaders should be induced to re-
adjust their thinking, which still
clings to the anti-boss bogey of
the Industrial Revolution. No
present-day employer of any
substance could exploit his work-
people even if he tried to.
There is but one remedy for
inflation, and that is to remove
the causes of it. Some years
must elapse before such a task
could be completed. Other mea-
sures are only palliatives. But
palliatives should at least be
realistic and effective within
their limits.
Doctors
It was untimely as well as
irrelevant for Sir Stafford
Cripps to turn abruptly from
his “grave - warning” speech
at Edinburgh and pour party
scorn on the doctors. Men-
tioning a “dangerous spirit
abroad among certain groups of
people who seem to think that
their own interests and opinions
ought to overrule the decisions
of the nation,” he accused the
leaders in medicine of adopting
an attitude which struck “at the
very roots of democracy.” As
the terms of the Act allow doc-
tors to choose whether or not
they come into the scheme, his
statement does not even make
sense. A very ready answer
comes to mind at once: the
medical profession has pledged
itself not to goi on strike.
While the slanging-match be-
tween the B.M.A. and the
Minister of Health grows in in-
tensity, the citizen stands by, in-
terested but bewildered. He
knows that, deep in the battle
of words, he is himself involved,
but at present he can’t see
where. It is rather like one of
those aerial dogfights in the
Battle of Britain when there was
a great deal of activity far away
in the skies: you couldn’t make
out which was which and who
was winning, but the scene was
exciting to watch, and you
knew that the result was im-
portant to yourself.
The citizen knows that he is
intended to get the finest and
fullest medical service for the
lOd, which is earmarked from
his compulsory weekly contribu-
tion of 4s. 10d., that the Act
comes into force early in July
even if the deadlock persists,
and that the B.M.A. don’t seem
to like Mr. Bevan.
The debate of February 9 was
remarkable for its unanimity in
one respect; all —Government,
Opposition and medical men —
were agreed that the Act must
become Statute. Mr. R. A.
Butler, speaking for the Opposi-
tion, tried his hardest to find a
way of bringing about a com-
promise between Mr. Bevan’s
truculence and the B.M.A.’s de-
termination not to yield.
It seems that four points of
difference remain. They are:
Right of appeal, sale of prac-
tices, control of “over-doctored”
areas, and basic salary. The first
three points are not incapable
of being settled, but the B.M.A.
are rock-solid over the £3OO
basic salary. To them it is at
once an ultimatum and a death-
knell- In the doctors’ plebiscite
on the Act the voting—made
public on February 19—was
40,814 against the Act in its
present form and only 4735 for.
G.-p’s and others voted by
25,340 to 4084 against accepting
service under the Act as it
stands.
No solution is as yet ap-
parent. Although powerful,
solid and, maybe, autocratic, the
B.M.A. is not “raucous-voiced”
or “politically poisoned,” and
its action is not “organised sabo-
tage of an Act of Parliament”—
as Mr. Bevan has ranted. To
talk to doctors is only to realise
that the B.M.A.’s views are
fully representative.
The truth is that the doctors
are concerned less with what
has been said than with what
has been left unsaid. They feel
that the basic salary is the first
step to their becoming State-
owned. Mr. Bevan’s ideas, de-
termination and influence with
the Labor party are well known
to them.
In plain language, they trust
neither him nor anything that
he stands for.

BALLET RAMBERT.
With its third programme—
and its best to date—the Ballet
Rambert has presented 11 bal-
lets to Sydney, and from them
it becomes possible to form at
least a rough assessment of the
company’s quality. Its strengths
are many, and, so far, it has
shown oqly one obvious weak-
ness—an apparent inability to
capture the mood of romantic
ballets like “Swan Lake,” “Les
Sylphides” and “Giselle.” Ex-
cept for a shade of histrionics in
“Giselle” and a touch of
raggedness in the early part of
“Sylphides” the Rambert’s danc-
ing of these ballets has been
meticulous and generally beauti-
ful in a coldly detached fashion,
but the veil of enchantment cast
by any of the three ballets is
so finely perfect that it is lost
the moment a thread of tech-
nique or histrionics become ap-
parent in its romantic pattern.
What also becomes apparent
from the current programme is
that Walter Gore is the com-
pany’s tower of strength, John
Gilpin has spectacular physical
grace and agility, but Gore has
also maturity and acting ability
and the artistic sense to control
those qualities over a very wide
range of expression.
Sally Gilmour, the company’s
prima ballerina, is a beautiful
dancer and a fine little actress ;
she is fragile and feather-light,
with wide eyes and finely-pointed
chin. She has considerable
dramatic range, but a lack of
dramatic strength. Her dancing
and acting are always appealing
rather than compelling, and al-
though that may be a successful
psychological approach to an
audience it is not so artistically
satisfying. As a reserve behind
Miss Gilmour are two or three
other dancers who, although
they could not step into her par-
ticular shoes, appear to have the
makings of prima ballerinas.
The most interesting and most
successful ballet of the current
programme is “Simple Sym-
phony,” choreography by Wal-
ter Gore to Britten’s suite for
strings. It is interpreted by some
colorful gaiety and sentiment in
a fishing village, and if at times
it proceeds literally by too many
leaps and bounds, the overall
effect is of simple exuberance
with sufficient of the enduring
qualities of beauty and origin-
ality to soften its occasional dis-
plays of technical dexterity—in-
triguing as some of them may
be. In this ballet anyway Gore
shows the same qualities as a
choreographer that he does as a
dancer—imagination and a good
range of expression and the
ability to say what he wishes
with grace and clarity.
Less successful is “The Fugi-
tive,” choreography by Andrde
Howard to music commissioned
from Leonard Salzedo. It con-
cerns two sisters who shelter a
fugitive from justice ; he falls in
love with one of them and the
other, in a fit of jealousy, betrays
them both. Melodrama is a fair
subject for ballet only if the in-
terpretation is sufficiently artis-
tic or decorative. In this case,
despite some dramatic dancing
from Walter Gore and Brenda
Hamlyn and some pretty pathos
from Sally Gilmour, the melo-
drama remains supreme, and
the total effect is of a shotgun
wedding between music and
dancing.
“Les Sylphides” attained the
necessary perfection only in the
final waltz, and suffered to some
extent from the muscular real-
ism of Miro Zloch. “Bar aux
Folies Bergere” ends its relation
to the Manet painting with its
name and setting. From there
on it is essentially a light
comedy, delightfully laced with
Gallic wit and delightfully
danced in that vein by Sally Gil-
mour, Walter Gore, Belinda
Wright and Joyce Graeme.
"Faust."
“Faust,” the second item in
the Australian opera season at
Melbourne Princess, had an en-
tirely different flavor from its
predecessor, “Aida.” Egyptian
pomp and savagery were re-
placed by medieval soul-search-
ing, and the spectacular aspect,
though well done, wasn’t so im-
portant.
Faust, in the robust person of
John Tillbrook, took a mortgage
on perpetual felicity with Satan
in a somewhat subdued fashion,
and there was a touch of the
adolescent in his transmogrifica-
tion into a youth prepared to
pay the price of eternal torment
for the pleasure of Marguerite’s
kisses. His singing, however,
was sensitive and full of tonal
richness, and blended perfectly
with that of Kathleen Goodall,
whose voice has an engaging
variety and accent and whose
acting betokened a natural sym-
pathy with the trials and tribu-
lations of a seminary young
lady suddenly flung into a con-
test with the powers of evil. As
the symbol for that Morris Wil-
liams wore the traditional red
costume and raised clouds of
sulphurous flame, but could
have been more sardonic.
Histrionically and vocally
Robert Simmons put on one of
the best shows as Valentine, and
his disgust and horror at his
sister’s disgrace were as striking
as his singing of the Cavatina.
Denise Walls was an appealing
Siebel and Etta Barnard made a
pert duenna.
The production was admirably
upholstered, and at least two of
the scenes—the church where
Marguerite is haunted by Mephi-
stopheles and the prison where,
her reason shattered, she is held
for the killing of her baby—
were of a much higher order
than most grand-opera settings.
All the traditional devices of
making Marguerite appear in a
vision and Mephistopheles in-
habit a pillar were effectively
presented, but the angels in the
heavenly apparition in the last
act had the) unfortunate appear-
ance of being twice as sub-
stantial as the human beings.
Wirths.
Wirths’ Circus is in Sydney
again, at its caravanserai near
Central Station, with elephants,
clowns, lions, horses, acrobats
and all. The Continental clowns
give a polished performance,
with more spontaneous gaiety
than is common in contempo-
rary clowning, snarling lions are
mastered by a slim young lady
with a whip, while other young
ladies do daring and graceful
things with ropes and trapezes.
There are performing dogs, per-
forming horses and a beautiful
cloud of performing birds.
The horses—grey Arabs —
cavort gracefully and intelli-
gently, one showing his spirits
by an occasional pigroot, but
they are always under perfect
control and at the word “ana-
bee” —or something very like it
—come off their wooden pedes-
tals as a team and flash round
the ring till the next word of
command. Their trainer, be-
sides having a whip, has a pre-
sence, looking, in fact, rather
like a firm-minded diplomat.
The elephants, of course, are
a show in themselves, highlights
of their act being the dangerous
suspension of several tons of
elephants over a fair-haired boy,
lying on his back in the saw-
dust with the belly of the nearest
crouching pachyderm a fraction
of an inch away ; and a “tight-
rope” act by one elephant on a
raised board. With ponderous
delicacy each great hoof is
swung in front of the other till
the board is crossed. Then the
elephant comes back in reverse,
then forward again, and finally,
in the centre of the board, turns
right round —something like a
ship wheeling in an alleyway.
Boys from the audience are
given their annual ride on a
cantering grey horse with
safety-belt and pulley —and
yanked and swung in a highly-
diverting manner, bumping
clowns like ninepins and
screaming with delight. One lad
successfully stole a clown’s
headgear and made a fine run
for it, round and round the ring,
losing the pack among the seats
and going to earth in a baffling
manner under the wooden
framework.
Artbursts.
Graham Tharley and G. S.
Crossley, two young ex-service-
men, have opened the autumn
art season at Melbourne
Athenaeum. Perth - born and
-trained, Mr. Crossley served
four and a half years in the
R.A.A.F., and has since concen-
trated on watercolor painting in
Melbourne. He belongs to the
traditional school and has an
eye for the picturesque and
pleasing. Mr. Thorley, a por-
trait-painter, is 26. He gets a
whimsical touch into his portrait
of George Dickenson, who looks
as if he had seen the ghost of
Mr. Chifley. His studies of three
girls are notable for an insistent
highlight either in the left or
the right eye, but his “Frank
Menzies” is a capable piece of
painting.
Sumner Locke-Elliott’s “In-
visible Circus” was given an
airing by Brisbane Amateur
Theatre. The production was
smooth, the sets good and some
of the scenes did convey the
brittle backbiting world that
this satire presents as com-
mercial radio. The cast was an
even mixture of indifferent and
good. Berenice Murray as the
receptionist played effectively,
while Alan Denby as the manag-
ing director. Rose Bonser and
Gloria Birdwood-Smith in two
small character sketches and
Cliff Pleak as the production
manager were outstanding.


Women's Letters
From Melbourne
The very different silhouettes that will
delight women this season were all seen
in the smart and interesting fashion-
show arranged to help swell the funds
of the Y.W.C.A. Venue was the Dor-
chester, and Douglas Cox supplied the
many and interesting models. The lovely
mannequins included Mesdames John
Masters, Richard Falkiner and Geoff
Wilson. High-sounding names have been
chosen for the new colors; among them
are Frappe lime, Florida rose, Fiona
green, Rivoli red and Renmark gold.
Ballet skirts, sun-ray pleated, are topped
by loose, raglan-shouldered bodices, tiny
waists or the new rounded shoulders. The
padded hipline has evidently come to
stay, and one beautiful example was a
burnt-amber velvet jacket, hip-length and
worn over a full skirt of off-white cr£pe.
The serrated edge of the jacket fitted
snugly over the padded hips. Military
frogs, glazed wooden buttons, gold but-
tons, high rounded lapels and revers are
points of interest in all the showings.
Hoods are worn on warm coats with
dolman sleeves; half-belts and box
pleats render smart the new daytime
coats. Shawl collars are also in the news,
and neat little basqued jackets over im-
mensely full skirts are favored for cock-
tail and evening wear. The dark jacket
contrasts with the light topes of the
skirt, and dull material is allied with
gleaming material to make chic en-
sembles. There are fitted bodices, high
necklines and broad belts, gilt or plain,
with gilt studs.
Many Y.W.C.A. officials were among
the noted. Mrs. Karl Kumm was ac-
companied by her daughter-in-law. With
Mrs. Wesley Ince, just returned from
America, were her daughters, Mesdames
Baragawanath and J. Shelton. With Mrs.
G, L Stevenson, smart in a black suit
and a small natural-straw hat trimmed
with black velvet ribbon, was her
daughter Mrs. Vere Hunt, whose royal-
blue frock featured the new full skirt;
her small white hat was trimmed with
royal-blue ribbon. Mrs. Jim Fitzgerald,
who helped organise the show, was in a
sage-green jacket-suit. Mrs. Dan Red-
dan, who acted as one of the ushers,
wore a primrose-yellow floral jacket-suit
and white accessories. Among the many
who enjoyed the fashions were the
Blarney lady and Mesdames James
Buchanan and Alec Cato.
Summer dresses and wide-brimmed
hats were the order of the day for the
Newmarket meeting at Flemington on the
last Saturday before autumn. The pleated
dress and the skirt allied to the short-
waistcd-fitting jacket were noticed, and
many of the dressmaker suits featured
peplums. Hats had many feather or stiff
quill trimmings. Navy and black nylons
and ankle-strap shoes made joyous com-
bination. Lady Dugan’s smart linden-
green ensemble, with its hiplength jacket
featuring collar andl cuffs of white shark-
skin, was worn with a deep nigger-brown-
draped beret, tilted sideways. With Rear-
Admiral J. A. Collins was Mrs. Collins,
her simple frock of mignonetfce-green
crepe contrasting with a small upturned
pinky-beige straw hat, draped at the side
with a deep-brown taffeta bow. Queens-
land visitor Mrs. Brandish, who was with
Mrs. G. R. Nicholas, wore a brown wool
suit with the new nipped-in waistline ;
her oyster felt hat had green feathers
down one side.
One of the debs of Race Week, Athol
Adams, of Nagambie, chose a sandy-pink
silk frock patterned in White and a small
white straw hat. Wendy Faulkiner, from
Mt. Cottrell, wore powder-blue crepe, the
skirt featuring unpressed pleats; her
matching straw hat was trimmed with
flowers and veiling. Mrs. Norman Tapp
was in white crepe, corded ribbon bows
turning back the brim of her large white
hat. Mrs. Charles Armitage wore a beige
crepe frock, her large beige hat being
banded in brown velvet. Mrs. Neville
Palmer’s black jacket-suit was worn with
a large upturned white straw hat. Mrs.
Geoffrey Grimwade’s green-and-black
crepe frock and small white straw hat
with veiling made neat alliance. Mrs.
Gordon Macarthur, in navy-and-white-
striped frock and navy straw hat with
white ribbon, was the personification of
coolness. Mrs. Lionel Newton wore one
of autumn’s newest hats; of white felt,
it had the brim trimmed with long feather
quills across the front. Mrs. Eric Avery’s
azure-blue pleated frock was worn with
a small white grosgrain ribbon hat with
white lilac trimming. Mrs. Harold Her-
bert wore a delphinium-blue corded silk
beret with the new wide crown as con-
trast to her black ensemble.
Gounod’s ever-popular “Faust,” with
its beautiful Garden Scene and its
pathetic story of Marguerite’s fall and
redemption, followed “Aida” at the Prin-
cess. Among the first-nighters were Lady
Knox, whose simply-cut floral evening
gown was worn under a brown satin coat
cut on the new peg-top lines. The Fraser
lady wore a black formal gown and a
small cap trimmed with ospreys. Mrs.
Garnet Carroll’s frock of old-gold crepe
was liberally trimmed with gold em-
broideries ; her cape was of blue fox.
Mrs. Dermot Connelly’s black-and-white
crepe tunic was worn with a black even-
ing skirt. Pat Christie’s lovely grey satin
gown featured a ruffled off-the-shoulder
bodice, and the hem of the full skirt was
ruffled.
Lady Clapp covered her black gown
with a geranium-red crepe coat. Her
daughter, Mrs. Geoffrey Smith, chose a
green-and-black floral chiffon gown, worn
under a brown ermine coat. 'Mrs, Frank
O’Collins added a black lace mantilla to
her short floral crepe dinner frock.
Madame Florence Austral, wearing a
black gown under her full-length brown
fur coat, sat in a box with Gertrude
Johnson, Director of the National
Theatre. Kathleen Goodall sang Mar-
guerite dressed in a frock almost modern
in its lines. Of powder-blue crepe, the
skirt fell in narrow pleats from a hip-
yoke and the bodice with white collar,
and cuffs adorning long tight sleeves. Two
long fair plaits fell below the waist from
a dainty cap of blue-and-white.
John M. Duncan’s camera has here
captured the alertness that is part of the
make-up of Mrs. Theo Lewis. The live-
wire president of a small committee
which raised £5OOO for the Miss Aus-
tralia candidate it sponsored in the Free
Kindergarten drive, Mrs. Lewis, who is
petite, has fair coloring and very blue
eyes, has been using her organising
ability recently on behalf of the Yering
Boys’ Home, which is a charge of the
Melbourne Diocese of the C. of E.
Because of the Lenten season the Mt.
Eliza Church of England was unadorned
for the wedding of Anne, daughter of
Mrs. J. Dunstan, of Mt. Eliza, and
Robert, elder son of Mrs. Isobel Green,
of Melbourne. Ceremony wasperformed
by the Rev. Frank Ray. The bride’s
gown of white crepe had small circles
embroidered in gold forming a pattern
on the material. Bands of gold lame
were set over the shoulders and joined
at the waist to form a pleated panel which
went down the back of the skirt to the
hem. From a coronet of flowers a lace
veil, covered with flowing tulle, swept
to the ground. Her bouquet was of
gardenias and thberoses. The bride’s
sister, Dymatha Blackford, was matron-
of-honor; she wore a gown of japonica-
pink crepe and small matching halo. Best
man was Ron McGregor.
Reception, which was at the home of
Mrs. Dunstan, gave the Menzies clan a
chance to get together—the ’groom is a
nephew of Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Menzies.
Mrs. Dunstan wore a black lace gown
over taffeta and a small floral hat. Mrs.
Green’s ensemble of royal-blue cr€pe was
worn with a small matching halo hat
trimmed with taffeta ribbon and small
ostrich feathers. Her daughter, Mrs.
Ron McGregor, chose a bouffant gown
pf white moire taffeta with real flowers
forming the shoulder-straps. Sister of
the bride, Mrs. David Kirton, wore a
white French lace blouse with her full-
length black taffeta skirt. Mrs. R. G.
Menzies’s powder-blue crepe gown
featured a fichu shoulder-line »to the
bodice, the slim skirt being draped at the
hips. Mrs. Syd Menzies wore a lime-
green crepe gown and corsage of white
tuberoses. Mesdames Frank and Les
Menzies favored black gowns. Mesdames
John Kaufman and Constance Day wore
white Arctic-fox capes with their black
gowns. Mrs. Eric Harrison’s gown was
of powder-blue crepe. The wife of
Group-Captain F. Headlam wore a white
lace gown over rose taffeta. Joan
Edmunds’s crepes were azure-bjue.
From Sydney
The first annual meeting of the Eastern
Command Women’s Auxiliary will be
held on Tuesday, March 9, at 2.45 at the
Staff Corps Officers’ Mess, Victoria Bar-
racks. The Governor, Lt.-General
Northcott, Mrs. Northcott and daughter
Elizabeth will be present.
Sydney discovered a different Sally
Gilmour last Saturday night. Into the
bar of the Folies Bergere she blew as
gay and feckless as a bit of thistledown.
She was mischief let loose in flouncy
black and white tulle, and a small pink
feathered hat that bounced up and
down in rhythm with her movements. A
joyous interlude, too, were the legs of
the barmaid in their paley-pink stockings
with cholocate rings. Ballet highbrows
swooned to the classic beauty of Syl-
phides,” and altogether the programme
was cunningly mixed for the palates of
all.
Last Saturday night two Miss
Brennans from Melbourne (the Miss
Brennans of dancing renown) were front-
seaters in the dress-circle. Other danc-
ing well-knowns were Pat Cay, Doris
Beattie and Lorraine Morton. The Davis
Lady, from Melbourne, wore graceful
platinum chiffons. With her were Dr.
and Mrs. Hamilton Kirkland. Mrs. Kirk-
land’s chiffons were off-white scrolled in
black, and a nice touch was the shoulder
scarf of black Spanish lace. Mrs. E.
Carey also chose black lace. With her
frock of cobweb weave she wore a short
string of pearls. Brightly-patterned linen
made Mrs. Fenton’s ground-length frock.
Mrs. Ruthven Blackburn’s leaf-greens
glittered on the left shoulder with gold
sequins. Mrs. Pierre Mann s taffetas
were dark-blue-and-red checks. Ballerina
frocks in varied shades of taffeta occurred
with frequency. Crepes, deep-green and
draped, were worn by Mrs. Anthony
Hordern, Junior, .
But nothing could dim the shining
glory of Sally Gilmour, whose engage-
ment to Dr. Allan Wynne, of Toorak,
was announced by Madame Rambert at
the end of the performance. It was a
pretty sight to see Sally being showered
with flowers, from the wings—the flower-
throwers were the' other members of the
company. Sally’s father is a doctor in
Peterborough, England. Dr. Wynn, who
graduated in 1944, served with the
R.A.N. for two years.
This is how Falk studios glimpsed
Deborah Collins from England. De-
borah is now travelling throughout Aus-
tralia and Maoriland with her brother
and publisher father, William Collins.
Over 600 came with enthusiasm and
many with cheque-books to Legacy s
lunch at the Trocadero. For this
was a launching as well as a lunch-
ing Legacy was launching its “adop-
tion scheme.” For £25 a year you
can “adopt” a war orphan. You give
the money, and Legacy takes the respon-
sibility of the care, training and guidance
of the child. '
No finer way of saying “Thank you
to our dead and our invalided soldiers
could have been devised than this Legacy
movement, which looks upon the child ot
the ex-serviceman as a sacred trust. Sir
John Gellibrand, over 20 years ago, set
the torch alight, and
War 11, it burns more brightly than ever.
Lord Mayor Bartley sped the appeal
and handed in his own cheque for £25
Loud handclaps for the effort of the
Greek community’s promise ot £2->U.
Bonds of Empire were knit more
closely last week by the conference of
the Royal Empire Society s branches in
Australia. This was the first conference
of its kind, and delegates came from Vic-
toria, South Australia and Tasmania, and
the sessions were held in the society s
Bligh-street home. Important visitor to
the conference was Colonel Archer Cust,
the Empirians’ secretary-general. He was
the principal speaker at the lunch in the
Trocadero when more than 300 Fellows,
their wives, daughters and friends fore-
gathered to hear this traveller from Eng-
land tell his story.
His was a tale of remembrance. He
told that England still warmed to the
memory of her people hasting to her
aid in the war years. Indeed, letters
from English friends still say they will
never forget the sight of the first Aus-
tralian soldiers walking along the Strand,
Piccadilly and Bond-street. No longer
then did the English feel they were
an island and an isolated people. Rather
was England the rallying-place for all their
far-flung kin. Apart from the idealistic
aims of the Empire Society there are
many advantages in being a member.
The London headquarters in Northum-
berland-avenue extends warm welcome to
the traveller. It arranges jauntings to
Ascot, the Henley regatta, the many
colorful and traditional ceremonies in
which England still revels.
Colonel Spain, the picture of health,
in spite of his recent illness, presided.
Percy Spender, M.H.R., was fluent in his
speech of thanks, and G. T. Clarke, M.P.,
from South Australia, rounded off the
speechmaking. There was a dinner for
the delegates at the N.S.W. club. Colonel
Cust went off to Brisbane towards the
end of the week, but returned in time to
pay a visit to the koalas at Taronga last
Sunday.
Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh,
with 30 members of the Old Vic. Com-
pany, left Liverpool in the Shaw Savill’s
Corinthic on February 14 and are due in
Fremantle on March 16. The Corinthic
carries only 80 passengers, and the com-
pany takes up about half of the accommo-
dation. During the voyage, as the
promenade deck is of unusual length and
one end of it glassed in, there will be
plenty of space for rehearsals should
Laurence so decide. In addition to the
usual programme of films the London
office of Shaw Savill has secured, by
special arrangement, the technicolor
feature film “Henry V-” And you
haven’t forgotten who takes the leading
part in that, have you? Ten scenic and
lighting technicians of the company are
travelling to Australia in the Moreton
Bay, They are due at Fremantle on
March 6.
An interesting woman arriving in the
Corinthic with the Old Vic. Company
is Elsie Beyer, M.8.E., who is accompany-
ing Sir Laurence Olivier’s party as ma,n-
ager. On her return to England Miss
Beyer will take up a new appointment as
general manager of the Shakspeare
Memorial Theatre, Stratford-on-Avon.
It’s going to be fun at the barbecue
at the home of the Sam Lands’ next
Saturday. It starts at five and goes on to
nine o’clock. Personalities of the radio
and theatre world will be star- (no, not
three-star-) scattered on the grass, Max
Oldaker, Jack Burgess, Jimmy Bancks,
Reg. Willoughby and Mo among them.
The barbecue is to help the fund that
will send Ernie McLoughlin to America
for urgent treatment. The Henry Brad-
don lady is president of the committee,
, Dorothy Foster is the organiser. Every-
body is working in an honorary capa-
city. For ss. you can help Ernie, and
have a grand evening. No. 29 Wunulla-
road, Point Piper, is the address.
One afternoon last week many Sydney
women and men turned their thoughts
away from the previews of the new
season’s imported coats and frocks, suits
and hats, the R.A.S. show and the A.J.C.
Easter race meeting, and walked amid
the grace of Canterbury Cathedral s
cloisters and crypts. The story of this
noble building was unfolded to eager
listeners by Archdeacon Julian Bicker-
steth, Canon of Canterbury. The Canon
is on a mission to collect funds for the
restoration of the bomb-damaged
cathedral. Three hundred thousand
pounds is the essential sum, and of this
£220,000 has been donated by England
and America—Canada gave very gener-
ously. Australia and Maoriland must
now get busy and pass around the plate
for the remaining £BO,OOO.
The Canon, a tall man, has what the
Girl in the Flat Opposite calls a “Gothic”
face, and (t lights up with the fire of his
enthusiasm for his cathedral—this flower-
ing in stone of Christianity. Most in-
teresting was the picture he drew of the
vital part the cathedral still plays in the
music, the art, the drama, of to-day All
readers recognise this inspiration in T. S.
Eliot’s Murder in the Cathedral and
Dorothy Sayers’s Devil to Pay. But
even more striking is the story of the
cathedral workmen—the workers in wood
and stone. Some of these men, 75 and
80 years old, came to the cathedral as
apprentices. They have come to glory
in their craft, and some of them have a
symbol with which they stamp their work,
like the artisans of the Middle Ages.
As age creeps on the older generations the
work is carried on by their sons and
grandsons in a proud tradition of service.

THE SERVICE MAN.
Compulsory Service.
“Ek Dum”: It was made
public on February 27 that in
August last 13 retired Austra-
lian generals of two wars had
sent a memorandum to the
Minister for the Army advocat-
ing compulsory military train-
ing—in other words, the restora-
tion of Australian Labor policy
in place of the Communist
policy which now rules in mili-
tary matters, as in Pacific affairs,
in Caucus and which aims at
weakening all forces calculated
to interfere with Russian imperi-
alism or with the chances of
totalitarianism.
The “Australian Communist
Party Training Manual” says:
The working class must break up
and shatter the State bureaucratic and
military machinery as a preliminary
condition of the workers’ revolution.
This is the policy of the leaders
of some of Australia’s biggest
unions.
Mr. Chambers reply appa-
rently was not given in full to
the retired generals—Sir Leslie
Morshcad of Alamein, Sir T.
W. Glasgow, G. C. Johnston, J.
W. Grimwade, J. H. Cannan,
C. H. Brand, F. P. Derham, H.
W. Lloyd, A. C. Fewtrell, C. H.
Simpson, A. H. Ramsay, K. W,
Eather and C. S. Steele, repre-
senting virtually all branches of
the Army. He merely told them
that the Government had estab-
lished its policy and could not
depart from it.
To the A.8.C., however, he
allegedly said that if the people
did not want compulsory train-
ing it could not be enforced.
This, coming from a Minister
of a party which at its last Tri-
ennial Conference ordered the
Prime Minister to introduce
compulsory nationalisation of
the banks —to which a majority
of the people obviously object—
compulsory price-fixing by the
Commonwealth and compulsory
unionism, i§ a ridiculous state-
ment.
The Government finds no
difficulty in compelling citizens,
and especially those likely to be
opposed to it politically, to pay
crushing taxes. And union bosses
which are not necessarily the
Government, find no difficulty in
bludgeoning their followers into
illegal strikes and the public into
putting up with endless incon-
veniences. The only things
which the Government finds
difficulty in compelling people to
do are those things which might
cost it extremist votes.
There would be no difficulty
about inducing the majority of
young men to enter heartily into
a policy of compulsory training
for the defence of their nation
if they were taught patriot-
ism and love of their country.
But since the present Labor
Governments have been in
power the conception has been
allowed to arise in the minds of
youth that the State is a sordid,
grab-all organisation reeking of
laziness and shabby-dealing, and
the idea of the class-war has re-
placed the idea of patriotism.
There are trade-union leaders,
with whose support the present
Government exists, who would
sooner, turn on some Australian
neighbors than repel any Rus-
sian invader. They are savagely
opposed to all military forms
of defence which cannot be
turned to the purposes of the
world revolution. If compul-
sory training were proposed in
order to send a legion to fight
for the Chinese Communists or
the “Indernesian Comrades” they
would be found ip full force and
voice on recruiting platforms.
Compulsory training is not
merely a need, but an urgent
and essential need, especially
for civil defence, which cannot
be put on a modern basis with-
out it. The stern, considered
opinion of many European
authorities is that Europe could
be plunged in war within the
next six months.
Malayan Dispatches.
during which he held command,
and there was nothing new in
his dispatch—indeed, consider-
ably more is generally known
about the refusal of militia
troops for use outside the Aus-
tralian coastline and about the
refusal to allow the Seventh
Division, A.1.F., a day’s steam
from Rangoon, to be put in to
hold that city than is said in the
published summaries of his dis-
patch. The Canberra Govern-
ment must be thankful for this
mercy.
The most important report of
all is General Percival’s. On the
summaries it seems a sound and
fair report that does full justice
to the courage and fighting
capacity of the Australians at
Gemas and Muar —Lieutenant-
General Gordon Bennett de-
scribed the General’s remarks as
“the most favorable special
praise bestowed on any units in
the report.”
Generally speaking, on the'
summaries, it justifies General
“Ek Dum”: Three reports on
the early phases of the Pacific
War were issued in the London
“Gazette” during the week:
(1) Field-Marshal Wavell’s on the
overall-A.B.D.A. command period.
(2) Air-Marshal Sir Paul Maltby,
assistant R.A.F. Commander in
Malaya, and late A.O.C. Java.
(3) Lieutenant-General Percival,
G.O.C. Malaya when Singapore fell
to the Japanese.
All these reports, though lengthy,
are naturally incomplete. To
get at the whole truth a public
inquiry would be needed, and
certain interests would veto
that
No commander is fully in the
confidence of his Government
or of the heads qf his own ser-
vice, for that matter; and he
cannot deal, in any case, even it
he knows them, with facts which
do not come within his respon-
sibility. Thus there were many
things between the British and
American Governments and the
Curtin Government which were
not the personal business of
commanders, but which very
vitally affected the whole
Malayan situation.
Air-Marshal Maltby, for in-
stance, blames American sus-
ceptibilities for having produced
the order that the Japanese must
not be attacked at sea until it
was absolutely certain that they
were going to attack Malaya.
The Australian Government was
very strongly a party to that
viewpoint. And, in any case, in
the light of Air-Marshal Brooke-
Popham’s report, it seems logical
to ask what the R.A.F. intended
to attack the Japanese With. A
few Hudsons, worn out with
overwork (limit range, 300 miles),
without any reserves, some Vilde-
beestes, three Cats—the only
machines with a range of over
300 miles —and some Buffaloes?
The 150-odd aircraft avail-
able would have had less chance
at sea than over land close to
its aerodromes, and that was
not much. Yet Air-Marshal
Maltby speaks of “hitting the
enemy convoys at sea as far
away and as often as possible.”
His report may, of course, be
badly summarised.
Again in his comment on the
surrender - broadcast of the
Dutch C.-in-C. of the Allies,
General Ter Poorten, discon-
certing as it was and open to
criticism in that the General’s
intention apparently was not
notified to his British and Ameri-
can colleagues—Marshal Maltby
and General Stilwell —Marshal
Maltby is evidently unaware of
the various circumstances lead-
ing to the Dutch attitude. One
was again the stand of the
Australian Government which,
a week or so after Singapore,
was shrieking that, whoever
stayed behind to fight or as
civilians, steps should be taken
to ensure that Australian troops
were evacuated to Australia —
a preference to which the com-
bined chiefs of staff did not
agree.
Following this, on Feb.
27, the British evacuated their
command, though Field-Marshal
Wavell was instructed to leave
behind sufficient resources to en-
able the Dutch C.-in-C. to effec-
tively exercise command. It was
intimated that if the Common-
wealth Government wished to
retrieve its control of North Aus-
tralia, which had been under
the A.B.D.A. Command, it
could do so provided Dutch air-
craft were allowed to operate
from the Australian coast
if necessary. The Austra-
lian Command came back
to Australia on or about March
3. And it was really the Can-
berra attitude which caused the
Dutch collapse. That story will
come out in time.
General Wavell, too, was not
in a position to deal with certain
political aspects of the period
“I ell me — are We on the right course for the Falklands ?”
Bennett’s conversion to the
viewpoint that:
This dispatch shows that General
Percival was a brilliant staff officer.
Failure cannot be laid on him per-
sonally. He, with many others, paid
the price for the Empire’s un-
preparedness for war.
The dispatch will be reviewed
at length in next week’s issue.
Light on Indonesia.
It has remained for a British
major of the 10th Gurkha Rifles
to tell the real truth firsthand
about what happened in Java
in 1945-46. His article is pub-
lished in the January issue of
the British Army Quarterly, the
most responsible of the Empire’s
military journals, and it is cal-
culated to bring a blush of
shame to the cheek of the Aus-
tralian “Government” and to
that of any Australian seaman
or wharflaborer capable of feel-
ing shame.
Major Houston says that the
quick collapse of the Dutch de-
fence undoubtedly caused their
prestige to suffer in the eyes of
Indonesians, and the situation
immediately began to be capi-
talised by the Japanese. They
hastened to recruit all the
toughest and most bloodthirsty
youngsters in the country, “giv-
ing them brutal training for
brutal deeds.” They put Indo-
nesian guards on internment
camps and forced Dutch inter-
nees and captives to bow and
scrape to them as if they were
Japanese.
They inducted Indonesians
into the kempeitai and allowed
them to take a hand in the
punishment of the Dutch. One
Dutch girl, caught listening to
the wireless, for a fortnight was
compelled to sit every day from
6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on a sharp
bamboo plant holding a chair
over her head. Each time she
lowered it an Indonesian guard
beat her over the head or
shoulders.
Armed by the Japs
Soekarno and Sharir having
previously fallen foul of the
Dutch, Soekarno in particular
seized his opportunity to negoti-
ate the Indonesian “freedom
movement” with the Jap con-
querors. And the unavoidable
hiatus between the armistice and
the arrival of the 23rd Indian
Division in Java and the 26th in
Sumatra had disastrous effects.
General Nakamura, Jap
C.-in-C., during this interval
ordered his troops to hand over
all arms and ammunition to the
“Indonesian Republic.” Though
these orders were not always
obeyed, the Indonesians under
Soekarno soon had vast stores
of every variety of arms and of
ammunition. Immediately an
incredible number of organisa-
tions, all armed to the teeth,
sprang up, each a law to itself.
At Samarang, by a mistake,
they took over a Japanese in-
ternment camp and massacred
50 Jap p.-0.-w., after which the
infuriated Japs, many unarmed,
counter-attacked and recaptured
their own arms and ammunition
with which the Indonesian dirty
work had been done!
The 10th Gurkhas arriving on
the scene found themselves at
war across a canal with the
Japanese until the Japs dis-
covered that they were not
Indonesians. The Nipponese
very apologised. The
Gurkhas had an unpleasant
time in the next few days, since
the countryside was full of (a)
still-infuriated Japs kidnapping
Indonesian “comrades” and
finishing them off; (6) Indo-
nesians preying on the Eura-
sians ; (c) about 13,000 terrified
refugees, who were anybody’s
meat.
Meanwhile the Indonesians
began to withdraw.
Incitement to Murder
While the Gurkhas were en-
deavoring to succor another lot
of refugees at Ambarawa—-
there were islands of both Dutch
and Eurasian refugees all over
Java—the Indian Brigade (49th)
which had landed at Sourabaya
split into companies, platoons
and sections which were seeded
through the town. While nego-
tiation was going on, on Oct. 27
proclamations were dropped
over the town declaring that any
unauthorised person carrying
arms would be committing a
.crime. That night shrieking,
hysterical voices over the Indo-
nesian radio incited the people
for hours together to rise, sweep
out the British, murder the
Dutch women and children at
and show no quarter
to any prisoners taken. This
was followed by well-organised
attacks on all the isolated sec-
tions of the division. Supported
by tanks and armored-cars, some
20,000 Japanese-trained Indo-
nesians, backed by an uncon-
trollable mob of 120,000 armed
with shotguns, bamboo spears,
swords and daggers, closed in
on the Indian detachments.
Officers going about the town
were dragged out and murdered
in cold blood—all except one.
A convoy of lorries bringing
women and children from the
suburbs was ambushed and a
murderous fire poured into the
defenceless occupants. Some
lorries were set on fire while
women and children were still on
them. From the almost hysteri-
cal remnants of the Indian
escort, which escaped after a
gallant attempt at defence,
came stories of Indians dis-
membered piecemeal while still
alive, of the burning of women
and children and murder under
the most revolting conditions of
those which fell into the hands
of the mob.
Wounded in ambulances were
pulled out arfd torn to bits by
shrieking crowds. Small Gurkha
posts, their inmates ordered not
to fire unless in danger of being
overrun, even in the face of
m.-g.- and tank-fire, were
blotted out in a fiendish surge.
The Indonesians demanded the
surrender of the Indians and the
handing over of their arms, but
when a truce was called fresh
fighting began, during which
Brigadier Mallaby, in command,
was murdered by an Indonesian
who walked up to his car and
shot him. Indonesians were
only driven out of Sourabaya
after heavy artillery and naval
bombardment and 21 days of
severe fighting.
At Magelang the protective
two companies of the 3/10th
Gurkhas were attacked as the
result of a treacherous decision
by the Indonesian local con-
ference to wipe them out. The
gallant Gurkhas killed 300 in
two days’ fighting and forced a
truce. Dr. Soekarno attended
the peace conference in Mage-
lang, arriving like European dic-
tators, preceded by screaming
motor-cycles and guarded by a
band of tommygunners.
A Comrade’s Jail
Renewed and ferocious
attacks on Magelang and Am-
berawa forced the withdrawal
of the gallant little handful of
British-Indian troops from Mage-
lang, leaving 2000 Eurasians to
their fate. These “just dis-
appeared.” Before Amberawa
was relieved the Indonesians
broke into one camp, killing
eight women and wounding 16
with grenades.
Other incidents included the
following:
A Dakota made a forced-landing
at Bekassi —a village with a bad
reputation before the war. The pas-
sengers and crew were paraded naked
down the street and then massacred.
A train, escorted by 12 Gurkhas,
backed into a siding. Overwhelming
numbers of Indonesians, dressed in
green uniforms with Japanese rank-
badges, pounced on it, killed the
guard and captured and tortured the
passengers.
Major Houston says that
“there can be no freedom for
the people of Java until the
monstrous criminals who now
roam the land have been run
to earth.”
Any civilised Australian must
shudder to know that these
murderous and bloodstained
ruffians are the friends and allies
of leaders of powerful Australian
key unions, which have para-
lysed trade with the Nether-
lands in their interests and
forced the supine and miserable
body in Canberra which calls
itself a “Government” to tolerate
their policy.

The British Labour Minister, in intro-
ducing the “1946 Assurance Companies
Act,” stated that “The 1946 Act”:—
“Acknowledges the inherently in-
ternational and comprehensive char-
acter of insurance.”
The Labour President of the Board of
Trade in the House of Commons also
stated that it would be proper to inform
the House of the attitude of the Labour
Government toward the future of British
Insurance business. The Government, he
stated, had no intention of interfering
with the transaction of Insurance business
by private enterprise. It is, he stated,
the desire of the Government that Insur-
ance should be, in the future, as in the
past, dealt with on an international basis
and as business of an international
character.

Industry
Roger Bacon
showed the world, for the first time, the
importance of scientific observation and
experiment. This remarkable man was born at Ilchester in
Somerset in 1214. After studying at the University of Oxford
and in Paris and Italy, he eventually returned to Oxford, and
became a Franciscan monk in 1251. In an age when science
was largely synonymous with the alchemists’ search for the
philosopher's stone and attempts to transmute base metals into
gold. Bacon displayed a scientific vision far in advance of his
era. He foresaw the possibility of mechanical flight, the use
of explosives, the improvement of sight by lenses and the
propulsion of ships by engines.
In all his teaching he insisted on the importance of experiment
rather than discussion, and on the necessity for first-hand
practical experience, particularly of such chemical operations
as distillation and calcination. He saw clearly that, without
this practical foundation, natural science was little more than
a collection of words. One result of his insistence on experi-
ment was to enable him to show that air is necessary to sustain
combustion. He has also been credited, but without adequate
evidence, with the discovery of gunpowder Some explosive
mixture was undoubtedly known in Western Europe in his time
for Bacon complained of the annoyance caused by boys letting
off fireworks outside his study.. He died on
the 11th June. 1292. leaving as his contri-
bution to science a way of thought which
still persists all over the world. Roger
Bacon, Englishman, may justly be described
as the first modern scientist.

"YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
It was a great day for the Dhotis
at Flemington; wins in three of the
six flat races; the Newmarket to
the most brilliant of the breed so far,
Royal Gem, defeating St. Razzle and
Fine Fettle and the rest of the mostly
well-performed big field with a ster-
ling run along the outside fence of
the “straight six”; Lungi downing
odds-on Fresh Roy in the St. Leger;
and Delhi too good for El Faloos,
Chosen and the huge field of other
two-year-olds.
Color, evidently, means nothing in
the Dhoti stock: Royal Gem (from
French Gem) is a brown horse (now
a five-year-old); Lungi (from
Chapani) is a three-year-old chestnut
colt; Delhi (from Waltzing Lily) is
a bay colt.
Royal Gem joins Bernborough and
Ajax in bringing off the Futurity-
Newmarket double, quite a rare
achievement. Ajax (1938) carried 9.6
in the Futurity, 9st. in the New-
market; Bernborough, 10.2 and 9.13;
Royal Gem, 10.2 and 9.9.
Always well up, Royal Gem
asserted his quality as they got near
the line, winning by a neck. As in
the Futurity, he was most capably
ridden by South Australian jockey
H. Patching. Nearest to the place-
getters was last year’s winner, Gay
Queen, then High Play, Chanak, Star
Port and old Tahmoor. A mix-up
at the barrier, apparently caused by
Flemish jumping into the tapes,
wrecked the chances of Flemish and
the heavily-backed Money Moon and
several others. But, whatever effect
that may have had, nobody had any
doubt that the best horse in the field
won. Royal Gem started favorite at
5 to 1, and ran the severe six fur-
longs in 1.11-J-; good time for the
race, Ajax and Waltzing Lily sharing
its record of 1.11.
Without detracting at all from
Royal Gem's record, which most
clearly speaks for itself, there’s an
odd fickleness shown by press scribes,
who cannot refer to him without the
addition of “the greatest horse in
Australia.” It’s only a few weeks
since the scribes just as invariably
applied the same phrase to Columnist.
One bad run—in the Futurity, when
he was palpably above himself in
condition —has relegated Columnist
to obscurity. He has only to be
saddled up fit and the fickleness may
take another sudden twist.
The defeat of Fresh Boy in the
St. Leger was a matter of poundage
being too much for inches. Xhe
Revelation colt is only a pony, and
the standard 8.10 beat him. . As
game as they make them, he’d be
a different proposition reasonably
weighted in any big handicap.
While the Dhotis took most of
the limelight, the Law Maker breed
also had its turn: the black colt
Ungar (out of Viennese) downing the
Powerscourt colt from South Aus-
tralia, Comic Court, the Hellespont
filly Blessing, and others in the Sires
Produce Stakes. Valcurl (how un-
lucky he was not to have strung up
three successive Moonee Valley
Cups!) beat Amelia and Robert Bruce
(only starters) in the King’s Plate,
Sanctus was too good for Royal
Pageant, Prince Chatham and others
in the Flemington Handicap, and
Faunus beat Cheery Boy and Sir
Nolle in the Hurdle.
Sanctus is a natural favorite for the
Australian Cup, but Oatcake should
worry him.
* * * *
Randwick on Saturday was almost
as great a day for the grey Nizamis
as Flemington was for the Dhotis:
Grey Nurse (K. Barratt) making a.
mocking exhibition of a big field of
two-year-old fillies, and Hiraji (E.
Swinton) winning the Denham Court
Handicap in a fashion that made him,
with his very inviting weight, look
even more than ever the goods for
the Sydney Cup. How inviting that
weight is can be shown by one com-
parison : Hiraji was weighted at 9.0
(second topweight) in the Australian
Cup, to Fresh Boy’s 7.13; in the
Sydney Cup Hiraji, 8.9, is eleventh
from the top, and Fresh Boy has 8.0.
As noted here before, color would
seem to be of most decided impor-
tance among the Nizamis. Three
greys of the breed turned out on
Saturday, for the two winners men-
tioned. The other, Nizam’s Ring,
seems to be suffering a complete loss
of her earlier form, but her past
record makes its own comment on
herself and the color. On the other
hand, the one bay and two chestnut
Nizamis who had a run were all
unplaced. However, the bay, Deep
Sea, is a very taking, if slightly leggy,
colt. He led till his cojjdition gave
out in Hiraji’s race.
The Diver —second to Hiraji—ran
a really good race, and there was
plenty of promise in Silent’s third.
This page’s selection for the Denham,
Valiant Crown, nearly came down;
Mulley was bumped forward on to
his mount’s neck and dazed.
Grey Nurse carried 9.2 (with full
apprentice allowance) and won so
easily that it did not say much for
the other fillies, though Whistling
Wind, a rather too lightly-built Ajax
filly, should soon win. Heliofly (W.
Cook) beat Bold Duke well, but had
a weight advantage which made Bold
Duke’s run look very sound.
Penmore (R. Kerrigan) in the
Three-year-old ; Heroic Sovereign (J.
Thompson) and Omit (A. Ward) in
divisions of the Endensor Handicap,
and Monsoon (W. Briscoe) in the
Warwick Handicap were the day’s
other winners. Thompson had to
ride the best race of the day to win
on Heroic Sovereign, getting there by
half a head from Lord Luck; but
Heroic Sovereign carried top weight
and showed real gameness. The
favorite, Brilen, and Royal Imperial
fell in Omit’s race. A new colt to
take the eye was Septet, third to
Heliofly. Septet is an attractive bay
by Genetout from that former flyer
Hesione.

Shannon finished last in the Santa
Anita Handicap. Quite evidently’he
was unfit, for he certainly isn’t as
bad as all that, though he was over-
boomed on the strength of perform-
ances restricted to Sydney tracks,
never having the testing of being
pitted against the best in other States.

Latest prize increases make the
AJ.C. Derby the richest race in
Australia (i.e., for the time being;
it’s only in the nature of things that
hitherto richer events will now be
bumped higher, in particular the Mel-
bourne Cup). The AJ.C. Derby
certainly has been boosted, on a reg-
ular Wallingford scale: a rise in
added money from £5OOO to £lO,OOO.
Additions of £lOOO each raise the
Epsom to £4OOO and Metrop. to
£6OOO, the 1949 St. Leger to £3OOO
and Sires Produce Stakes to £5OOO.
The Derby rise is a most admirable
emphasis on a classic, sure to have
valuable effects on breeding, and in
a good year sure to produce a great
race.

Age, apparently, doesn’t wither
them in England, nor ’chasing stale
their stamina. Schubert, who won
the Bognor Steeplechase at Fontwell
Park a week or two back, is now
14; the distance was 3£ miles. “The
old warrior,” London “Times” racing
scribe enthusiastically commented,
“still has the appearance of a good
horse, and I could imagine no more
popular victory in the Grand
National.” The National, incidentally,
is this year, for “austerity” reasons,
being run on a Saturday, March 20.

Westralia wound up an excellent
season with a fine win against India,
at Perth, by six runs. Needing 190
runs in their second innings India
fell for 184, chiefly through the
bowling of Charlie Puckett, who took
6 for 78 (11 for 134 in the match);
it made Puckett’s bag of wickets for
the season 35, av. 21,14. Thus Wes-
tralia in its first year of first-class
cricket defeated South Australia, Vic-
toria, Queensland and India, and, of
course, bagged the Sheffield Shield.
The Indians played 20 matches on
their Australian tour; five won
(three v. Country teams, one v. Tas-
mania and one against an Australian
XI at Sydney), seven lost (four of
them Tests), and eight drawn. Hazare
headed the batting with 1495, av.
62.29; next, Amarnath, 1170, av. 55.71.
Hazare and Amarnath each scored
five centuries. Mankad topped the
bowling with 81 wickets, av. 21.34;
Amarnath took 31, av. 27.77, Phadkar
31, av. 21.35, and Sarwate 27, av.
33.33.
Listing as an essential of a sport-
ing tour that “it should be enjoyed
by visitors and homesters alike,” the
“Times” Rugby Union scribe rated
the Wallabies’ tour “a notable suc-
cess.” He added: “They played fast,
enterprising and attractive Rugby. It
was hard, as all Rugby should be,
but only in rare instances —when the
local David set out to bring down
Goliath at all costs —was there a
really rough match. In the matter
of tactical skill in midfield and at
forward they were repeatedly de-
scribed as slightly disappointing, but
perhaps too much was expected of
a side who, after all, like ourselves,
had six years of global war close
behind them. Much of their kick-
ing, too, was not up to the highest
Dominion standards, but, then, this
Australian team gloried in the kind
of open Rugby in which kicking
plays only a minor part. Most
British teams kick far too much,
and frequently no better than the
Australians, so it hardly behoves us
to wax superior on that count.”
When they left England to head
home via America the Wallabies had
a record good enough for any tourers.
The matches in France included, they
had played 35 games for 29 wins
and six losses, scoring 500 points to
243.

Scrappers at the Olympic Games
at Wembley will fight their battles in
a most unusual setting—in an island
ring in the middle of a swimming-
pool holding 750,000 gallons of
water. Reason is that there’d be only
one spare day, a Sunday, for empty-
ing and covering the pool, and it
couldn’t be done in the time. Two
bridges will connect the island ring
to the “mainland.” Even so, the lily-
whites aren’t likely to be assailed with
the ancient cry of “Fish-oh!”

“E.F.C.”: No, Rusty Cook was
not beaten at the British Empire
Games (B. 17/12/’47). In London,
in 1934, Cook beat the champion
of England, Moyes, and the cham-
pion of Wales, Taylor, in the one
night at Wembley, and won the
British Empire lightweight champion-
ship. In 1936 at Berlin Olympiad
Cook beat the Polish champion in
his first fight and later was beaten
by Suvio, of Finland, the winner of
the welter division.
In the view of Jack Dempsey, Joe
Louis has come to the stage the
former champion reached near the
end. “I found,” says Dempsey, “my
reflexes were first to go. I’d see an
opening but it would close up before
I could punch. When I was younger
I seemed to punch at the same split
second I saw the opening. In my
later fighting days I’d see a punch
coming in plenty of time, but I still
couldn’t duck in time.” While not
committing himself on the next Louis-
Walcott scrap, Dempsey believes some
hustling young fellow who could
punch would be a sure thing against
Louis today.

Ray Coleman (8.11) and Jackie
Wilson (9.4) are getting quite on
fighting terms with each other. For
the fifth time they met last week at
Leichhardt intent on mayhem, the
other four similar affairs having re-
sulted in two draws and a win each.
This time Coleman’s stronger finish
put him one ahead.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Zake”; The little slab hut almost
hidden by the blackberries was at least
10 miles from the nearest township and
three miles from any habitation. Nailed
f to one of the slabs was a roughly-lettered
notice in green paint long faded:
“Clocks and watches repaired.” The
ancient sitting on the step outside the
door was scratching his dog’s ear and
lolling back enjoying the last of the day’s
sun. I pointed to the notice as he looked
up at the sound of my footsteps. “Have
much trouble getting spare parts for
Swiss movements?” I asked. For a
second or two he looked puzzled, then
he laughed. “Oh, I haven’t done any o’
that since they give up minin’ in the
township fifteen years ago,” he said.
“Anyway, the perfession was gettin’ too
crowded. Since then I’ve taken on mend-
in’ violins an’ harps. I’ll git around
to alter the notice one o’ these days
when I got a bit o’ time to spare.”

“Mat’s Mate”: We got into the pub at
Bogan Gate late one night, had a couple
of drinks and got a room. We were tired
and glad to note that pretty well every-
body had gone to roost. Just as we
doused the light and settled down a
woman’s voice called “Jim, Jim! The
dog isn’t chained up!” A door opened
and heavy feet went along the passage.
Presently they came back. Silence fol-
lowed. I was just slipping off when the
voice called again, “Jim. Oh, Jim! I
forgot to put the butter in the ice-chest,”
The passage and return of feet was re-
peated. Time passed. Came the voice:
“Jim, Are you awake, Jim? The bal-
cony-door is open.” Jim’s feet pattered
back and forth. Nervously we awaited
the next call. It came: “Jim. You
awake, Jim? The bar-parlor light wasn’t
put out.” A moment’s silence, then a
male voice roared in triumph “Ah,
tricked y’ that time. I put it out when I
chained up the dog.” Silence. Mat arose,
partly opened our room door and
shouted “Jim! Hey, Jim!” A startled
voice replied “Eh? .Yairs, who’s that?
What is it?” “Nothin’,” cooed Mat; “just
wanted t’ be sure y’ was ready for the
next call.” He shut the door and jumped
back into bed and we smothered our
gurgles in the blankets as Jim stalked
wildly up and down the passage threaten-
ing blue murder “on the bloke givin’ me
cheek in the middle of the night.”

“G.A.8.”: Near Boggabri (N.S.W.) a
veteran pair of wrens, nesting as they’ve
done for years in a particular thorn-bush,
were this year made the victims of a
cuckoo invasion. They tolerated the baby
cuckoo until it had successfully ousted
the last of the junior wrens, then, not
content with merely deserting the in-
truder, they deliberately tore the nest from
under him and set up a new home in a
bush on the far side of the house. It
looks' like a revolution among the
suckers.

“Flip”: “I spent a year fighting Bom-
bina Council to get the light and water
put on to my house,” said Harry. “I’ve
put in the last six months crawling to old
Bindle so he’d let me have an electric
stove. Then, when everything was teed-
up I advertised the cottage for holidayers
in a city paper, and a family of them
moved in yesterday. I goes up to see how
they were getting on this morning and
found them sitting around a fire in the
backyard cooking snags for breakfast.
When I asked the bloke if the power had
failed he says ‘Oh, no, Mr. Jubb —we
came here to get away from all that; we
“The flirl!"
want the real bush atmosphere.’ He tells
me he’s also using the tank water —-‘not
that piped stuff’—and that he’d even
brought hurricane-lamps for the house.
Reckons they’re having the time of their
lives. About here,” said Harry, “I start
thinking they’re bats. And when the
bloke’s wife says ‘My husband shot a
goanna this morning, Mr. Jubb —how
long do you usually grill them?’ I’m
flamin’ sure of it.”

“Bilbie”: It was rather a coincidence
that we should read “Palms’s” par. (B.
28 /1 / ’4B) the day after I brought home
two coconuts which I found growing on
the open beach near here, about 60 miles
south of Mackay (Q.). They were well-
rooted in the sand below high-water
mark, and each bore healthy shoots about
2ft. long. I have planted them on my
own creek, and shall be interested to
see if they transplant successfully.

“Gem”: “Wimmin!” growled Joe
disgustedly. “They’re the limit all right.
Why, only yesterday me wife goes down
to feed the fowls when I hears her yell
out, ‘Joe! Joe, quick, bring yer gun,
there’s a goanna in the fowlhouse!’ So
I grabs up me shotgun and races down,
yellin’ as I climbs in to hold the door to
so’s he won’t get out. But when I gets
in I finds it weren’t no flamin’ goanna
but an enormous carpet-snake, so swelled
up from scoffin’ orf two o’ me prize fowls
that he couldn’t get out again through
the nettin’. He’s got another in his mouth,
an’ when he sees me he starts careerin’
around scatterin’ fowls everywhere, then
makes straight fer me. I makes a dive
for the door, only to find the missus had
slammed and locked it in her panic and
is tearin’ up the yard yellin’ to me for
help. Y’ can still see me shape where
I went straight through the nettin’!”
* * * *
“Old-timer”: A score or so of years
ago we were drifting drought-stricken
sheep from Moonlight into the river
country around Prill when the cook
pulled out. Pocket-knife left for the
station to get a supply of tucker, and
Punch decided to make a damper. Late
that night \ve eyed him hungrily as he
took the thing from the ashes and leaned
it on its side against a stump. Next
morning we tried to cut it, then we tried
to break it: if we’d had any explosive
we’d have tried blasting it. Little Curl’s
saddlehorse stood on it and sprained
both fore fetlocks, young Bob drove the
wagonette over it and broke a spring.
We rolled it into the scrub and sadly
awaited the' station tucker, which arrived
by car that night. The boss went off
into the scrub, collided with Punch’s
damper and had to be taken straight
home suffering from a broken toe and
mild concussion. When we left camp we
stuck a notice over the thing warning
strangers against it. I never thought to
meet its equal in this life. But I have —
I have. Last Monday morning I watched
my sister in a Sydney suburb trying to
cut a McGirr Day-baking Act 40-hour-
week loaf which had been delivered on
the previous Friday moreing, and I wept
for - the injustice done to Punch in the
long ago.

“Dusty Mile”; “Yow” (B. 21/1 /’4B)
can add to his facts about the taipan
that there js no record of victim of
its bite recovering. Dr. C. Mf Kellaway,
of the Walter and Eliza Hall Trust,
places it among the three worst snakes
on earth. A large specimen injects 4{-
grains of venom, against the death-adder’s
modest lj grains. Its habitat is the N.Q.
coast from Rockhampton to the Penin-
sula. But, to most N. Queenslanders the
taipan is just another brown snake. This
explains why so little is heard of it, and
incidentally why some bushmen aver the
brown snake is “bad,” while others claim
it to be mild and comparatively harmless.
It is easily recognised apart from the
color. The body tends to the triangular
rather than the cylindrical; the head is
long and spear-shaped. It shares with
the death-adder the distinction of being
one of the two snakes in the Common-
wealth with curved fangs.

“The Rabbiter”: Old Jim, a tomato-
grower on the Murray above Mildura,
has his own philosophy about working in
his garden alone. “Don’t come near me
when I’m busy,” he told me. “If any-
thing disappears I’ll be thinking either
you’ve pinched it or I’ve lost it. If I’m
on me own I know I’ve lost it—and who
to call a blasted so-and-so.”

“E. 2”: Kemp, who kept the store at
Scrubpatch, was strict with his tobacco-
ration. There was a lot of muttering
about his niggardly dispensing of it, but
he maintained stoutly that he never let
any go to anyone he didn’t know. Then
one day a tourist pulled up in front and
bustled in. “Tobacco come in yet,
George?” he asked, breezily. “Well, I
want a packet of flake.” Charlie, who
saw him come out clutching the weed,
confronted Kemp. “Now, y’ can’t tell us
y’ knew that cove,” he said. “He jist
blew in from the road, an’ I bet y’ ain’t
seep him before in y’r life.” “Well, I
dunno,” replied Kemp, coming out of a
daze. “He got it before I woke up. But
if I don’t know him how d’ y’ reckon
he knew me name was George?”
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: The guests at Bon-Holi-
day were epicurean eaters, but they paid
well for their fads, and quail was one
of them. Every morning old Dainty
turned up at the back door with a dozen
of the game-birds, received his payment
from the proprietress, and departed. And
every morning the sporting guests set out,
with their prizewinning gundogs and
elaborately-chased guns, only to return
with bags as flat as their spirits. The
flats for miles around were worked, but
not a bird was flushed. Somebody tried
following the old pensioner; he spent
the day in the pub. But early next day
he was on the doorstep with his dozen
cleaned and plucked as usual. In a
moment of inspiration one of the sports-
men offered the old bloke a quid for a
day’s service as guide. Dainty took the
cash, led the party over miles of rough
country, but failed to show them a quail.
Bright and early the following morning
he arrived with his customary dozen. The
sportsmen were incensed, said so, and
were promptly told where they could go.
“All right,” said one, “I’ll fix you.” A
few hours later the local copper slipped
out of the saddle at the door of the old*
’un’s shack and began rather regretfully:
“You ought to have better sense, you
know. Nobody would mind you potting
off a quail out of season if you kept it
under your hat.” Old Dainty waved a
grubby hand towards the fowl-run,
“There’s no closed season for young
bantams, is there?” he grinned. The Law
gave a solemn wink and swung back on
its horse.
* * * *
“Horseless Horseman”: Throughout
inland Australia the most numerous large
bird must surely be the galah. Droving
in pre-war days down the Darling near
Tintinology a sight I will always re-
member was a flight of hundreds of
thousands of these extraordinary birds.
First the sunlit heavens became a
giant cloud of gleaming lavender-grey,
then it flashed into a blaze of pink as the
myriad of birds, as one, wheeled and
showed their roseate-tinted under-sur-
faces. Incidentally, out west these grey
cockatoos are betjter guides to water than
are quail, bronzewings or black duck.
You never find galahs feeding more than
10 miles from water, and they always go
in to drink morning as well as evening.
To locate water one has only to watch
the direction the squawkers fly an
hour or so after sunrise and before sunset.
On reaching lagoon or swamp they fly
right into the water and then, screaming
and screeching—reminiscent of an old-
time Friday-morning bargain-sale—they
walk out over each other before settling
down along the bank to imbibe.
* * * *
“Chevroford”; According to Profes-
sor G. L. Wood, of Melbourne, com-
mercial fishing in Victoria is of a “very
sissy pattern.” Possibly the professor
hasn’t been out in a shark-boat in Bass
Strait in a 60-m.p.h. gale or sheltering be-
hind a lone rock for days in a cray-
fishing ketch with its well crawling with
the crustaceans. There is practically no
shelter on the Victorian coast from Port
Fairy to Queenscliff, and while there are
good ports on the south-east coast they
can’t be re-entered when a sou’-westerly
is blowing. No doubt the sissy fishing the
professor referred to was for “couta,”
which are plentiful around Melbourne.
Twenty or 30 boats go out and the
“couta” almost jump into them. In a few
hours they fill up their quota of 15 boxes
ordained by the middlemen’s ring in the
city and return to port. Two days of
this is sufficient to provide a profitable
living, so there is no inducement for a
fisherman to go out battling with a hos-
tile element to gratify the romantic
dreams of a professor.
* * * *
“Nor’-west”; That stingray lance (B.
28/1/’4B) was only a tiny one, being a
mere 2|in. Around the Kimberley coast
lances of Sin. are not uncommon. A
ray carrying a probe that size would
easily weigh scwt.; while the tail would
measure Bft. or 9ft. Some rays have two
stings, though the twins will be shorter
than a single sting. The sting springs
from the tail about a foot down from the
butt, and is evidently intended by Nature
as a defence against the shark. The
natives often make good hunting spear-
ing these monsters in quite shallow water,
the ray having a liking for feeding
close inshore. One odd thing: with such
a ready-made spearpoint at easy com-
mand, it is, however, seldom used by
the abos. Possibly, being such a ghastly
weapon, it has been ruled out by the
Kimberley Abos.’ League of Nations as
being over the odds in the friendly pas-
time of tribal warfare.

“Bo”: As Lonegum’s only street
drowsed in the midday heat there came
a shout from the end of the town where
the road meandered down to the creek
crossing. Presently a panting figure hove
in sight. It was Tubby Dennett, fran-
tically propelling his 15st. of blubber
up the final bit of incline. To the pub
verandah he made, and his vocal urgency
at last stirred the lone occupier, who sat
idly pulling the long stems of paspalum
shooting up by the edge and chewing
them. “It’s old Mick Carstairs,” puffed
Tubby. “He was fillin’ his forty-gallon
drum in the crick an’ stepped into a. deep
hole. I just see him go down —y’ better
hurry or he’ll be drowned. You’re the
on’y one in the town who can swim,
Smacker.” Slowly Smacker came to the
perpendicular and delivered himself ot
a prodigious yawn. Then he looked
round. “Wait till I get me hat,” he said.
“Never mind y’r hat —he’ll be gone
if y’ wait any longer,” protested Tubby.
Smacker yawned again. “Y’ reckon y
on’y saw him go down once, didn’t y ?
demanded the tired one. “Well there s
two more to go before he goes down for
good—what’s the hurry?/’
THE ROAD TO ADELAIDE.
The Coorong lay beside us as placid as a pond;
The horses ran before us, and who so gay as
we, •
With mallee to the right of us, a desert waste
beyond,
And sandhills to the left of us, and after that
the sea?
A hundred head and over, and half of them
unbroken,
They filled the open country and they kept
us wide awake;
For they were wild and nervy and by the self-
same token
There were many rogues among them who
were ready for a break.
On the trodden sand beneath us one could hear
the bare hoofs drumming,
The everpresent challenge that the big mob
made ;
Half a league ahead of us you might have
heard us coming
As we swung along the Coorong on the road
to Adelaide.
Soon we met the lanes again, and through a
town we battled;
I was riding Parasite and steadying the lead;
A youngster kicked an empty tin; among their
feet it rattled;
And off they went, a hundred head, in terri-
fied stampede.
No threat of whip could stop them and, mad-
dened in their fright,
The whole mob swept upon me in a narrow
crowded lane,
I galloped on before them with the spurs in
Parasite
And did a mile at racing pace before I
breathed again.
The chestnut was a blood one, and if somewhat
past his prime
Was full of pluck and stamina and more
than passing fleet;
He could throw behind the furlongs pretty fast
at any time
And now he went the faster for the thunder
of their feet.
From fence to fence they shouldered; no room
to stand aside;
Wild-eyed, with streaming forelocks, they kept
their level line;
There was one only answer: to ply the spurs
and ride
And leave the rest to fortune and that gallant
horse of mine.
We won to open country with a length or so
to spare;
The outlaws spread and steadied and returned
to sober sense.
’Twas an easy job to wheel them with the other
riders there
And calm fhe beating hearts of them and
hold them on a fence.
I’ve backed a good few buckers and preserved
a cheerful smile;
I’ve ridden over fences and have never been
afraid;
But I wasn’t quite so happy when I rode that
flying mile
The day our mob went crazy on the road
to Adelaide.

“Salmon Gums”: There’s nothing acci-
dental in the incidence of the kookaburra
in W.A. (B. 4/2/’4B). The bird was
brought over to inspect the place, liked
it, and decided to settle. It finds much
to laugh at in the big State, but we know
our faults and can take a little construc-
tive criticism in the right spirit. But tell
me: Can kookaburras still raise a grin
in the Ma State?

“Goldie”: Charlie’s aged tourer hav-
ing shed its body, he fixed it up with
boards to carry a load of provisions and
gear out to his gold show at Skeleton
Creek once a week. At 20 m.p.h. on the
badly-corrugated road the contraption
was as hard to stick on as a flank-roped
steer, and Charlie wasn’t often seen with
a passenger. But Fraser, wanting a ride
out to his farm one day, took the chance.
He was given a box to sit on. “Handy
s-sort of a b-box, that,” he yelled over
the motor, taking the bumps vocally as
well. “list like what the m-missus’s bin
wantin’. Where’d y’ g-git it?” “Aw, I
g-git me gelignite in them fifty-pound
boxes,” Charlie bellowed. “Well, I-I
wouldn’t mind if y’ c’d git m-me one,”
Fraser yelled. “Looks nice clean p-pine
in it, too.” “Aw, y’-y’ c’n have this one
when I’ve used th-the —b-blast the bumps
—geli in it.” The terror was slightly ex-
ceeding its usual speed limit of 20 m.p.h.,
but Fraser was off the back and 50 yards
into the scrub before Charlie could ease
the throttle.

“B. A. Ker”: * I’m not doubting
“Horty C.’s” word, but I would like to
know how that seed bloke was able to
keep the presence of blood-and-bone an
under-the-counter secret (B. 11/2/’4B).
My route home from work used to in-
clude an agonising quarter of a mile past
an Italian’s market-garden. I breathed at
the beginning of the ozone and again at
the end; and my nightly dash through
that odoriferous stretch would have
made Opperman look like a kid on a
wobbly-wheeled scooter. I never did find
out who was the fellow-sufferer that
qfialked a big A in front of the name
swinging proudly over the white, five-
barred gate of Roma Farm.

“Wippegong”: Only time ghost-stories
ever brought joy to our place was one
night when the forces of Nature con-
trived to rout the person who was ad-
dicted to this insidious form of anecdote.
A big-framed, big-voiced, fiery-headed
“A good job We saved the cargo, bos’n!”
wench this, and whenever she descended
upon us the household was usually
thrown into chaos to conform to her
current notion of entertainment. This
night the ghost-virus was at work. A
nuggety gum-stump was on the open fire,
and from its roots blue-tipped spurts
of flame were flicking at the brickwork
and at us ; so Ginger blew put our lamp
and settled down to give us the shivers.
Dad was soon nodding, Mum, who gives
everybody a hearing, appeared to be in-
terested, and we nippers had reached
various stages of fear, wonder, doubt or
hostility when —bang! —something crashed
against the iron overhead, hurtled round
the room, hitting every wall at least twice
and scurried with a rattle under the sofa.
Blue let out an unrehearsed shriek and
collapsed, and Dad leapt to life and lit
the lamp, not so much to attend to the
recent raconteur as to identify the
horrible warm, sticky drops that were
plopping into the fender. A moment’s
tense inspection, then he put the lamp
back on the table and resettled himself
with a triumphant grin as he contemplated
the babbling wreck who had undertaken
to scare us. The trouble? Oh, the fire
had warmed the mantelshelf a bit more
than usual and the cork had blown out
of Mum’s yeast.

“Flathead”: For a week the/ sea “out-
side” was green mountains, whipped by
a howling southerly. On Saturday, when
things had quietened down a little, a small
trawler limped up the channel and into
the peace of the inlet. Its crew stumped
towards us on the jetty, and after they’d
acquired the makings and knowledge of
their latitude, they told us in good, hot-
toasted sea words what had happened to
them: “Deck-winch was playin’-up at
Eden, so we headed out for Sydney to
get it fixed. Kept about two miles off
the coast till we were twenty miles south
of this place, where we struck the dirty
stuff. Then last night the motor conked.
Old Snapper’s right enough when she’s
going, but, dead, she’s like a duck with
lead feet. By the time we had the motor
to bits we were half a mile off-shore, and
by the time we’d got it dried, clean, and
back together again she was already
smackin’ her rump on a rock. We got
her goin’ after a bit and headed in here
to give her a proper cleanin’.” Consider-
ing the harshness of the local coastline,
old Snapper and her crew performed
a major miracle in ever reaching the in-
let, and someone declared that they must
be very thankful. The fishermen looked
glum. “Thapkful for what?” snorted the
skipper. “ ’Struth, we were down to our
gun’ls in gummy-shark and had to dump
the flamin’ lot!”
“Strop”: “Ex-C.G.” (B. 11/2/’4B) is
in error in supposing that Steinbeck “must
have seen that picture of a nursing-mother
using a simple stratagem to feed her
father through prison-bars.” The in-
cident belongs to the folklore of various
districts in Europe. Fifty years ago, while
visiting Tillietudlem Castle in Scotland, I
was shown a barred window in the ground
level of the ancient ruin, and was told
the local version of the legend, complete
with the names of the principal characters.
* * * *
“Waddlin’ Willie”: Victoria’s coast
cray-fishermen have a new theory to sub-
stantiate their diminishing hauls. When
the State’s Fishing Inspector, A. D.
Butcher, visited the ports recently, they
bashed his ears, blaming octopuses for
eating their fish. They went further, and
accused the shark-fishermen of taking all
the shark which ate the octopuses. Now it’s
up to the C.S.I.R. to examine the theory.
* * * *
“Colonial Cove”: When all sorts of
fantastic tales, such as indiscriminate
shooting-down, poisoning of flour and
of waterholes, breaking-up of tribal life
by white domination, have been sorted
out, the main reason for the decline of
the Australian aborigine is that which H.
G. Wells ingeniously evoked for the
destruction of his Martian invaders in
his War of the Worlds —the insidious
microbe. Before the white arrived the
black was comparatively disease-free,
His dry isolated continent harbored no
measles, pneumonia, diphtheria or typhoid,
nor have I been able to learn that he
suffered even from cancer. Measles
alone to a body with blood destitute or
antibodies against it is as deadly as
bubonic, Linked with measles were pneu-
monia and pleurisy. Lack of resistance
was further increased by the black’s ten-
dency to garb himself in the white’s cast-
off clothing. Apart from the diseases that
such garments harbored there was the
abo. practice of wearing such clothing by
day and casting it off at night in the bush
camp. For every black that perished by
“Stop annoying your dad, Wally, and let him enjoy his holiday!"
violence there were a thousand killed by
kindness.

“0.W.W.” (M.L.): Owing to repeated
brawls, an Auckland hotel has published
a statement that Maoris will not be served
with liquor in any of its bars. Some
Maori welfare-workers have supported
the ban. Since the war ended there has
been an influx of young Maoris to the
cities. Flashly dressed, they can be seen
in noisy groups any week-end, especially
around Wellington and Auckland hotels.
Shearing-shed and other farm labor is
hard to get here, but Henare prefers the
40-hour week and the pint-pots in the
city. Before the 40-hour week was intro-
duced young natives were a rare sight in
city jobs.

“Western Toiler”: For the benefit of
“Aperist” (B. 14/1/’48): I work in the
dry hot north-west of Queensland, mostly
fencing. When working, 1 wear boots,
hat and shorts. Although I seldom visibly
perspire, normally by 10 a.m. the salt
can be scratched off my skin almost any-
where, and from then on throughout the
day I am pestered by native bees. I once
thought they were after the moisture be-
fore the hot winds dried it, but it seems
it’s the salt they appreciate. They are
almost as annoying as the ever-persistent
“grass” flies.* I am thankful they are
only the small native stingless bees and
not the Italians.

“Martin Gale”: The young ex-sailor
applied for and got a position as junior
partner in a mid-western Queensland
commission-agency. After a few months
the senior partner-cnm-auctioneer decided
that the time had aome for the youngster
to make his professional debut. Briefing
young Bill for his first sale, he suggested
that he find his voice in private before
taking on the job proper. Bill drove a
few miles out of town to an old disused
bridge for a rehearsal, and in five minutes
knocked down a dozen or so “beasts” in
brisk style. Then he thought it might be
as well to practise what to do should
the bidding be slow. After haranguing
the reluctant “bidders” for a while, he
shrugged disgustedly, turned to the
imaginary owner beside him, and asked
“Well, sir, what am I to do with him,
knock him down or pass him in?” Came
the deep voice of a bluey-humper taking
his ease unseen in the shadow of the
bridge, “Knock the b down and give
a bloke some sleep!”
* * * *
“Hanko”: Clucking fussily, the black-
birds creep through my climbing vine on
the hunt for caterpillars of the vine-moth,
an attention the sombre little rogues will
take tribute for later in ripened grapes.
Then, too, will come the silver-eyes to
puncture the choicest berries and sip their
juices, a misdeed that spoils whole grape-
clusters by setting up a devouring mould
in them. ’Tis then I force myself to re-
member the rosebushes the birds have
cleared of aphis. Withal, silver-eyes are
charming midgets; their querulous call-
ings are pleasant to the ear, and per-
chance those blue-moulded grapes harbor
a modicum of penicillin.

“Gravelsnatcher”: He came out from
England towards the close of the last
century and established himself on the
pearling-grounds at a time when each
new arrival was accepted as a fugitive
from justice in some part of the world.
He was reputedly the black-sheep of an
English noble family, and because of his
obvious breeding and education, and to
distinguish him from other similarly-
named characters, he was colloquially
designated Gentleman James. Once he
found a beautiful pearl and took it to a
buyer to whom he was indebted to the
tune of £3OO. The buyer took the pearl
as payment of the debt, refused Jimmy’s
demand for a further £3OO and announced
the transaction closed. Jimmy departed,
vowing vengeance and giving the dealer
until noon to change his mind. Then he
sought his kanaka crew. He had a good
crew who obeyed him implicitly, and
there was in his step a jauntiness that
should have warned the dealer when
he returned at noon. “The deal has been
closed, Mr. James,” the buyer stated.
“Good afternoon.” The ex-nobleman
walked to the verandah and whistled
shrilly. Immediately the building shook
to the blows of axes as the kanakas,
stationed at each corner, attacked the
uprights. One corner was collapsing
when the dealer rushed out with a more
acceptable offer. “Thank you,” Jimmy
beamed as he pocketed the notes.
“Would you care to join me on
my lugger in a celebration of what
we must both regard as a satisfactory
deal? My table appointments are not
of the best, but” The buyer declined.
* * * *
“Seearjay”: There’s little doubt that
those Balts who are starting in the big
timber in W.A. (B. 11/2/’4B) will make
a good job of their work, but the climate
will slow them down after a while. Six
of their compatriots who settled in the
Nambucca district (N.S.W.) after World
War I, having learnt the art of squaring
sleepers, put the local workers to shame,
both for quantity and quality of output,
but most of them couldn’t stand the pace
and drifted off to other occupations.
One who stayed later evolved a method
of sawing sleepers, so eliminating the
waste of the broadaxe method. This
system, after being inspected by both
railway and forestry inspectors, was
adopted, adapted and put into use by the
Forestry Commission. The originator,
having failed to patent, profits nothing
from the use of his invention, but, with
the help of his big Australian son, goes
on working his own little outfit.
* * * *
“Betcha”: Even sheep sometimes
develop individual oddities, a sensible one
being the old ewe that always presented
herself voluntarily at the shed for treat-
ment when she was afflicted with fly-
strike. Then there is the woolly that,
when yarded, never fails to follow as I
work through the mob. No matter how
long the job, or how often I wade
through the bunch in search of strays,
she is always just out of reach behind.
As she has never been a poddy, the con-
clusion is that she has solved the problem
of jamming in the yard by sticking to
the one safe place. Again, there’s the
jummie that beats the mustering dogs to
the foot of the spur and leads a string
of followers into a rough, ferny gorge.
Though she is always dogged out again
with considerable trouble, she never
misses an attempt to get away with the
ruse. Turned a bunch of old ewes into
the house-paddock the other night just
as a kid came to feed the fowls. Im-
mediately one old ewe trotted o t ut pur-
posefully, scattered hens m every direc-
tion, and began nibbling up the wheat.
Then, catching sight of the empty dish in
the feeder’s hand, she investigated it
thoroughly, gave a snort of disgust
quietly rejoined the mob. She hasn
been hand-fed since I bought her five
years ago. Evidence that sheep can also
remember.
THE THISTLE,
I flourish when the wide winds Wow,
And white my sails float by;
In fields anew I thrive and grow,
And raise my head on high.
Aye, be it road or paddock bare,
Be it green fields, or town ;
I steer my ship adown the air,
I sail my thistledown.
Where once the struggling farmhouse stood,
Where man would till and sow,
There do I take my livelihood
And, oh, so richly grow.
Beside the fallen fence I lie,
Where long the old posts sleep;
Among the wild weeds so live I,
And by the ruins keep.
A wanderer I, I pitch my camp
Beside the sleeping stones;
By rotting earth that holds the damp;
Where lie the bricks and bones.
By mossy palings in the grass
I grow both straight and strong;
To me the weedy path and pass
For ever shall belong.
I am the wanderer of the wind;
Wide are the fields I fly;
Across the earth my bed I find
Beneath the stretching sky.
VICTORIA.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Bad Worm Season.
“Bungaree”; The worm giv-
ing the most trouble just now in
north-west N.S.W. and southern
Queensland (B. 25/2/’4B) is the
“barber’s pole,” or large stomach
worm. It is about an inch long
and the female has diagonal red
stripes around its body, hence
the name. Bloodsuckers, they
may be controlled in varying
degrees with phenothiazine, car-
bon - tetrachloride (double
strength), bluestone and nico-
tine, bluestone-arsenic or blue-
stone straight, in that order of
effectiveness. Phenothiazine is
scarce; double-strength carb.-
tet. is effective and should be
used as far a§ possible, costing
only about |d. per head per dose
and easy to administer. Drenches
containing bluestone are only
partly effective, because in many
sheep the bluestone fails in its
mission of closing the groove at
the bottom of the gullet and
switching the drench to the
fourth stomach, where the
worms are.
Nodule-worm is also flourish-
ing, and the only drench for it
is phenothiazine. But the
greatest menace, particularly to
young sheep, is black-scour
worms, so small that only a
practised eye can detect them,
though the sheep may be dying
from them. Bluestone and nico-
tine, once the standard drench-
mixture for this worm, are in
short supply and only half as
effective as phenothiazine. In
view of shortages of drenching
materials it is best to use carb.-
tet. on all grown sheep and
phenothiazine on young sheep.
Sheep - owners in western
areas, usually not subject to
worm-infestation, should watch
their sheep closely. If in doubt
they should obtain fresh drop-
pings from suspected sheep and
send them for expert examina-
tion. The egg-count can be ob-
tained within about 24 hours,
but to find out which worms are
laying it is necessary to hatch
out the eggs. This takes at least
a week.
Beware of the travelling sales-
man armed with a microscope
who claims he can examine the
droppings on the spot and tell
what worms are present. All
experienced parasitologists ad-
mit that it is impossible to
identify the species of worms
from their eggs.
A Blowfly-dressing.
“Atlanta”: Promising results
Have been obtained at Trangie
(N.S.W.) experiment farm from
benzine - hexachloride (8.H.C.).
G. J. Shanahan, B.Sc.Agr., and
F. Morley, B.V.Sc., report that
since the “compatibilities of
B.H.C. with certain materials are
not fully known,” some delay
may occur before B.H.C. blow-
fly dressings are available com-
mercially.
An important feature of the
tests during the severe fly wave
last spring, when about 200
strikes were treated with various
B.H.C. preparations, was the
comparative absence of restrikes.
One flock of rams treated for
moderate head strikes with 1 p.c.
emulsion of B.H.C. did not show
a single restrike. It seems that
this emulsion will free the strike
of maggots and prevent restrike,
but it must be emphasised that
the emulsion would not in itself
be a good blowfly dressing, as it
does not give a satisfactory kill
of old maggots, which escape
from a strike following treat-
ment.
Fluoride Waters.
“Agric”Queensland Health
Department is experimenting
with ways and means of treating
bore-water containing an excess
of fluoride, and a Sydney firm is
interested in the commercial
aspect. It’s easy enough to label
“fluorided” water and warn
humans not to drink it, but what
of the sheepman who has
thousands of animals to water?
Where it is possible to water
young lambs during their teeth-
formative period at earth dams
very little trouble should be ex-
perienced, but it isn’t always
possible, particularly in a dry
time, and graziers in the affected
belt will welcome an economic
method of treating affected bore
water.
It is not known outside Gov-
ernment circles how serious the
position is in Queensland, as
any information obtained from
analyses of bore-water is kept
a close secret, but a special com-
mittee set up by the Govern-
ment appears to be doing every-
thing possible to collect all
available data and expose all
ways and means of solving the
problem.
Wimmera Wheat.
“Ben C.”: Pinnacle, a selec-
tion from Pindar made by G. S.
Gordon, has turned up trumps.
It was let out to growers in 1946
With these claims: midseason
maturer resembling Ghurka but
with slightly taller straw, like
Ghurka and Quadrat very re-
sistant to flag smut and likely to
strip well. Its flour quality is
even better than that of Pindar,
which is superior to that of
Ghurka.
Now the “Vic. Agricultural
Journal” shys that it “marks a
distinct advance in the objective
of improving not only the pro-
lificacy, but also the grain and
flour quality of Victorian
wheat.” Anyhow, in tests at
Longerenong it beat Quadrat,
Ghurka and Magnet over five
years by from 1.4 to 4.1 bushels
an acre.
All the same, it has a fair way
to go to outdo Quadrat, the lead-
ing Wimmera wheat, for popu-
larity. In seven years Quadrat
jumped from nil to 56.4 per cent,
of the Wimmera wheat area, its
nearest rival being Magnet,
which is grown on about 16jr
p.c. of the Wimmera’s million-
odd acres. Ghurka is next with
12j p.c., then come Pinnacle
and Pindar with roughly 3 p.c.
each.
Quadrat? It comes from a
Ghurka-C.M.G. cross and has
been a consistently heavy yielder,
especially on Wimmera black
land. It’s a free stripper, with
brown chaff and strong straw
and was first bred at Werribee
research farm.
On Longerenong records the
Wimmera rainfall averages
about 16in. a year. For its black
soils Pinnacle, Quadrat and •
Magnet are recommended, with
Diadem as worth trying; for
its red soils and the fringe be-
tween black and red, Quadrat,
Magnet and the old reliable,
Bencubbin, with Pinnacle, Dia-
dem and Insignia worth a trial.
Cutting Corrugated-iron.
“Radian”: Of methods put
forward I vouch for the old
handsaw (B. 11/2/’4B). If many
"Go and break up that mothers' meeting, Bluey!”
sheets are to be cut make a top
and bottom former, to fit the
corrugations of the iron, from
clean Sin, by 2in. hardwood, long
enough to take a bolt each side
of the sheet. If wing-nuts are
fitted to the bolts it is a simple
matter to slide the gadget to the
required position, clamp on the
iron and cut along the edge of
the former as though it was a
straight edge. Corrugations are
thfis protected and cutting is
much easier.
Once, when cutting several
hundred sheets a circular saw
was reversed on the spindle and
used in conjunction with the'
formers. This proved satisfac-
tory beyond expectations; but
anyone who tries it out should
rig an efficient guard over the
saw —just in case.
Saddling a Colt.
“ Wirrameju ”: Normal
saddlery for a station hack
should consist of a plain or
headstall bridle, saddle, crupper,
blanket or thick felt saddle-
cloth and, perhaps, a breastplate.
The saddle should be fitted with
a strong girth and surcingle,
good leathers and plain stock-
type irons. All the gear should
be the best and strongest avail-
able and should be inspected and
oiled at least once a month.
This tackle, and long driving-
reins, is all that is necessary for
colt-breaking on a small scale.
The physical peculiarities of
the colt will determine their use,
e.g., if he is low in the wither,
the greater need for a crupper,
if he is well-sprung and fat, the
breastplate will aid in prevent-
ing the saddle slipping sideways
and so on.
Catch the colt and tie him to
the post in the centre of the
yard. Hold the bridle in front
of his face. If he hasn’t learned
to open up for the bit,’place the
forefinger of the left hand on
the bar of the lower jaw, behind
the tushes, and force it down. As
soon as he opens up, draw in the
bit and slip the headstrap behind
the ears in one easy, unhurried
movement. Avoid handling his
head and fumbling round his
ears as much as possible at this
stage, and never try to get the
bridle on in a hurry. If you
draw it up too far, in order to
get the headstrap clear of the
ears, you’ll jag his mouth, he’ll
toss his head and take fright at
the headgear. Adjust the
throat-leash just so that it is
not possible to rub off the head-
strap. It should fit snugly in
the hollow of his throat. Should
he be touchy round the head,
gently rubbing his eyes, under
his jaw and the butts of his ears
will help. He’ll look for it after
a while.
Let the colt sniff the saddle-
cloth and adjust it on his back.
Take the saddle on your left
forearm, cross the leathers over
the seat so that the irons hang
on opposite sides, then draw
girth and surcingle over in same
way. Let the colt sniff the
saddle and then place it on his
back. No jerky throwing move-
ments, and no dabbing it on and
sliding it into position. Grasp
the pommel with your left hand,
the cantle with your right, lift
it above his back and lower it
on gently. Hold it there for a
minute with your right hand and
soothe him with your left until
he is quiet.
Allow girth and surcingle to
slip down the off side. Stand
close to his shoulder, facing aft,
and reach for the girth. Watch
the hind legs. A cow-kick is
always in the offing, here, and
can easily mean a broken wrist
or arm. I always use a long
wire hook for this, but it is
often more of a nuisance than
a help and is not essential.
Buckle your girth and surcingle
firmly, but not tightly, then the
crupper.
Move to his hindquarters and
stand with your left leg close
in to his near leg, your hip
against his stifle to feel the least
movement. Lay the crupper
along the croup with your left
hand, lift the tail with your right.
A little massage of the bare
patch under his tail helps here.
As soon as he releases The ten-
sion on his tail, draw the
crupper round and buckle it. If
the buckling can be accom-
plished one hand, so much the
better, but be careful. He’ll
play Old Harry if he jams that
buckle under his tail. The
crupper should fit loosely enough
for three fingers to fit under it
at the croup. Let him wear
the gear for a while and then
remove it. Repeat this process
Often, each time doing it a little
quicker, and gradually tighten-
ing the girth and surcingle.
Watch the bare skin of his
tail. Colts are prone to chafe
with a badly-fitted crupper. In
one* 20min. lesson you should
have complete confidence in
youi colt to stand quietly while
being saddled. A good school-
ing here will save a lot of broken
harness later on.
Sorghum-planting.
“W. Court”: The sorghum-
planting season is at hand, and
this crop in Queensland is find-
ing hundreds more admirers
each year. It is a cheap crop
to plant and adapts itself better
to dry soils than corn. The
sweet varieties ensile as well as
corn and their food value is
about the same. The only real
factor that puts the sweet sor-
ghums behind corn as an emer-
gency fodder for stock is their
prussic-acid content until after
flowering.
However, the sweet sorghums
seem likely to be forgotten in
the rush to grow the new dwarf
varieties. New growers will
come a thud with Milo, Hegari,
Kalo and the others. They are
not fodder sorghums like sacca-
line and Imphee. Their value
lies in their yield of grain for
.stock feed; their stems are apt
to be coarse and unpalatable to
stock.
’Ware Sprogs.
“Urana”; Worried by spar-
rows in your poultry-yards? The
amount of feed they consume is
negligible, but sparrows flying
from one run to another carry
disease germs and weed seeds on
their feet and drop them off on

clean ground. Considerable
trouble can be caused this way,
especially in times of epidemic.
You may wonder why your
fowls begin dying-off when you
have taken all precautions and
have let no other poultry on to
the place. The germs cling to
the sparrows’ feet or are passed
out in their droppings and will
quickly spread. To a lesser ex-
tent wild birds are also disease-
carriers, so it is to the poultry-
farmer’s advantage to keep all
outsiders away from his hens—
if he can.
Feeding Tame Birds.
“Kurilla”: Aviculturists can
obtain benefit from discriminate
use of meal-worms" (common
grain borer) as a source of vita-
min A and animal protein by
feeding a few once or twice a
day to insectivorous and honey-
eating birds. Once the birds be-
come used to it they will readily
take them from the hand in a
quick flash by, or out of the air,
after being cast there, or from a
receptacle placed on the ground
from which quail, pheasants,
etc., may obtain a supply.
Robins, wrens and their ilk can
successfully be kept in a large
flight containing plenty of
shrubs and ground cover if their
diet of patent food is supple-
mented by a few worms, but be
sure that they really get them.
Unlimited worms must not be
fed, as the birds will not want
to eat anything else. To obtain
a constant supply of worms ob-
tain a box about the size of a
tea-chest, with a reasonably
tight-fitting lid, so that the
worms cannot escape. Cut a
small hole in the lid and tack a
doubled piece of fly-wire over
the hole. Place some old sack-
ing, newspaper, a few handfuls
of bran, a couple of carrots, any
banana-peels, a few potato-
peels, a few damaged apples and
any leftover bread to the depth
of an inch or two in the box :
the object being to supply semi-
darkness, a slight degree of
moisture, ventilation and food.
Next seek under any old sack-
ing, around boxes where fowl-
feed, etc., has been kept, under
almost any debris which is often
found about the average shed,
for either worms or beetles.
Place either worms or beetles in
the box and leave alone until a
supply has been bred, usually
about six months. Once a
supply has been founded other
boxes may be started. Some big
aviculturists run to a meal
wofcm-house, where countless
thousands are bred annually.
Hints for the Farm.
“Bat”: Should one or more
quarters of an udder become
tough to milk and produce little
it is a sign of mastitis. The
remedy is to milk the defective
quarter several times a day, and
if improvement does not result
a chronic condition may be
taken for granted. Cows suffer-
ing from the disease should fce
got rid of.
“Big Billy”; Best horse for
general farmwork is one with
sound, wide, strong feet, hard,
sharp bones and without a thick
mantle of hair which gets matted
and caked with mud. Coarse
bones and coarse hair usually go
together; both are undesirable.
Too tall a horse is not ideal;
medium-sized types are usually
the hardiest. A thick, low-set
horse often pulls his big leggy
companion to skin and bone.
“Radian”; Litharge mixed to
a paste with glycerine stands up
to heat and resists both oil and
water. It is ideal for jointing
oil or petrol pipes where a per-
fect seal is required. Old-style
honeycomb radiators, prone to
core leaks in places not readily
reached with a soldering-iron,
may be repaired by filling the
leaking cell with a stiff paste of
litharge. Before applying the
paste make sure the surfaces
are free from oil or moi§ture.
In a radiator pack the paste in
with a matchstick. Litharge is
stocked by practically all
chemists, and one teaspoonful
goes a long way.
“Sarina”: Wilt is usually
blamed for the sudden demise
of tomato plants approaching or
in production, but my experience
is that tomato-mite is more often
to blame. This tiny parasite
attacks the stems, and the plants
wilt off in a few hours. Spraying
from time to time with com-
mercial lime-sulphur is a sure
preventive; even dying plants
will sometimes rally after treat-
ment.
“Oiler”: For slipping belts the
best stickfast is a mixture of oil
and resin. Sump-oil is satisfac-
tory. Heat oil and resin together,
taking care that it doesn’t burst
into flame. The mixture should
be of thick treacly constituency
when prepared ; if too thin, heat
again with more resin. It works
wonders with dry belts, giving
plenty of grip on shiny pulleys.
“W. Court”: For prussic- or
hydrocyanic-acid poisoning in
stock, which have eaten im-
mature sorghum, rank cowpeas,
01 various weeds, the best anti-
dote is thiosulphate of soda
(hypo), obtainable from any
chemist. Give a horse from
half to one ounce of hypo in
a pint of water; one to three
ounces of hypo in a pint of
water for a cow. Failing the
proper antidote, give the animal
molasses or molasses and water
in large amounts.
“Billjim”: Fumigation is a most
effective method of rabbit destruc-
tion. Danger of erosion caused
by digging in flat country liable
to flooding can be minimised by
it. It should be done system-
atically, one area being carefully
worked through and each day’s
operations checked on. Dogs
are necessary to put rabbits
underground. Be sure to seal
the openings.
“Ben Acre”: Some stockmen
swear by charcoal alone as treat-
ment for strychnine-poisoned
dogs. I have known it to be
used with success. Before giving
it to dogs, it must be ground
and moistened with water or
spittle.
“Johnn o”: An effective
method of picking out unpro-
ductive hens is to place a piece
of woollen cloth, saturated with
glycerine and colored with a
dye, above the entrance of each
nest so that hens will strike
against it when entering. The
result is that laying hens will
bear marks on their heads, backs
or tails, while non-productive
hens remain unmarked. After
two or three tests the loafers can
be segregated.
“Lub”: To grow large, well-
formed carrots it’s best to trench
the soil, a foot for short varieties
and 18 to 24 inches for the long
ones and parsnips. Friable soil
that doesn’t set too hard after
watering is preferable. Remove
the soil in sections and stack at
the side, so that it can be re-
turned the way it came out.
Work compost, fowl manure,
wood ashes and super, into the
bottom, fill in and sow the seeds
in drills. The roots will pene-
trate to the rich layer and fill
out evenly to that depth. Don’t
allow the beds to get too dry,
for subsequent watering causes
splitting.

“Come in, Barcelona . . .
Well, at the end of the day’s
play the scoreboard reads
‘Argentina all out for two
hundred and fifty-six, no
sundries. Spain one for eighty-
four, one sundry.’ Highlights
of the play included three no-
bulls which were bowled from
the southern, or Gibraltar end,
and which, treated with appro-
priate derision, were caught just
inside the fence. Again today
bodyline was in strong evidence,
and after one vicious bumper
sizzled past him the Spanish
captain was seen to pat a rough
spot on the pitch with his bata-
dor. But the sensation of the
day was Spain’s one sundry.
What did you think about it,
Arthur?”
“Well, Vic, in all the years
I’ve been watching bullfights
I’ve wanted to see something
like that, and I think it appro-
priate that I should finally wit-
ness it on the ground where, in
1905, I played my own first
Test.” (Here the radio faded for
half an hour, but luckily he was
still talking when it picked up
again.) “This came when a
black cocker-spaniel fastened
himself on to the bull’s leg, dis-
tracting him to the extent that
he missed what would have been
a certain hat-trick. His delivery
went hopelessly wide and the
umpire signalled ‘One leg-bite,’
and, really, ladies and gentle-
men, I’ve only witnessed one in-
cident approaching it. That was
back in 1904 in a county match
at Seville...”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND

Labor on the Land
Under the 40-hour week the factory
whistles and hooters of Australia signal
knock-off at somewhere about four in
the afternoon. The echo of that signal
is penetrating deeply into the country,
and Jack the farmhand and Bill the
stationhand are being disturbed by it.
Jack has also had a letter from his
brother in the city. “You’re a mug,” it
says, “to be sweating out there in the
heat and dust all hours for six quid a
week. There are plenty of jobs down
here carrying seven or eight quid for
five eight-hour days, and no need to bust
yourself, either. It’s a gentleman’s life
—big dining-room to eat in, showers to
clean-up under before you go home, a
sports and social club, and a superannua-
tion scheme to look after you in your
f old age”
Maybe Jack is not tempted. He likes
the slower tempo of farm life, the sun
on his back and the wind and rain in his
face. He likes the mateship between
master and man which still persists in
the bush, and Le can’t stand the city, any-
way. But what about young Jack, who
will soon be looking for his first job?
Can he be blamed if he turns to the city,
where there is more money for less work,
and life is less tough?
Australia is still mainly a farming
country, but, with increasing penetration
of the country by industry, we’ll have to
devise some way of keeping the labor
force on stations and farms. Otherwise
only the no-hopers will percolate there
like a sediment. The factories will take
all the good men. The present genera-
tion bom and bred on the land will not
desert it in any numbers, but what attrac-
tion has it for the youngster with no
capital but his own hands?
The answer? Wages and conditions
of employment more in line with those
in industry; more agricultural education
so that a young man goes on the land
with the status of a tradesman, not of
a laborer; better housing in the bush,
more water, electricity, better roads, rail
and mail services, air transport; and
finally a perpetual system of land sub-
division and low-interest financing to
make land of his own attainable for every
youngster. At present' there is little
future on the land unless you have capi-
tal—Kell (N.S.W.).
The Big Wens
The N. S. Wales shire population
figures for 1947 should disturb every
thoughtful Australian. In 1940 the N. S.
Wales Government Statistician gave the
residents of the shires as 842,710. His
figures for 1947 (816,793) reveal a fall
of 26,017, though in that period the
whole State showed a gain of 200,000.
Some of those formerly domiciled in
the shires have no doubt shifted to
country municipalities, but the great
majority have been attracted either to
Sydney or Newcastle. Since 1911 the
proportion of the population living out-
side the Sydney and Newcastle area has
fallen from 55 to 43 per cent.
That is a thoroughly unhealthy develop-
ment, bad for economic, political, social
and defence reasons.
Our most vital task is to arrest this
growth of the capitals at the expense of
country districts. No society can flourish
when the majority of its people are con-
centrated in a few huge cities while rural
areas are gradually depopulated.
The creation of several new States, the
extension of further powers to local-
government bodies and measures to de-
centralise secondary industries by giving
taxation concessions and other advantages
to factories in country districts would
all help to solve the problem.— Sam
(N.S.W.).
The Wheat Bungle
At the end of January most wheat silos
in N. S. Wales were full, there were no
rail-trucks operating, no bags available
and there were still millions of bushels
to be taken off. Knowing they would
have to hand over to Mr. Chifley most of
the proceeds of any additional stripping
farmers threatened to down tools. One
to my knowledge, without silo space or
bags, left 250 acres unstripped to enjoy
a holiday by the sea.
At the World Cereals Conference in
Paris on July 10, 1947, Mr. Dedman pre-
dicted that Australia would harvest a
record this season of 210 million bushels.
With that prospect, Mr. Pollard in mid-.
October rebuked as Jeremiahs those who
foresaw a harvest bungle, but events have
proved that the cockles were right. On
October 2 Mr. Graham, N. S. Wales
Minister for Agriculture, doled out
assurances —but no bags—that everything
could be safely left to him and that bulk-
heads were not suitable for this State.
That advice was nonsense. Bulkheads
are unsuited for shot wheat carrying too
much moisture because 'it cannot be
turned periodically. Had Mf. Graham
built the bulkheads in August-September,
when he was asked to do so by Country-
party farmer members, f.a.q. wheat not
shifted by trucks to the seaboard could
have been tipped into them. The lower-
grade wheat could then have been put
into the silos, which have machinery for
turning it to prevent it going mouldy.
But “Labor” had the good wheat put
into the silos, then refused to permit
farmers to put their shot wheat into the
bulkheads. At some centres “Labor”
stopped construction of the bulkheads.
After another somersault “Labor” de-
cided to allow lower-grade wheat into the
bulkheads, and wanted to know why they
were not completed. More bags are now
beipg distributed—too late where millions
of bushels have become food for mice.
—F. D. (N.S.W.).
Disposals Sales
At a recent New Guinea disposals sale
a crowd of buyers went on strike because
the items were being knocked down by
the auctioneer at prices that prevented
them being resold at a profit.
From their inception, C.D.C. auction
“What, again! Didn't I kiss you a while ago?”
sales have been a good example of the
country’s interest in returned men. How
many know that jeeps in good order were
bought by the score in N ew Guinea at
£lO each, some for even less? Trucks
and utilities of all types were disposed
of in hundreds at £25 and £3O each.
Freight to the mainland averaged £4O
per vehicle.
But these bargains were not to be .had
by ex-servicemen. True; a few who hap-
pened to be on the spot in New Guinea
at the right time got a vehicle for their
own use. But the great majority were
bought by private buyers from Australia
—for whom permits to enter the Territory
and seats on planes were readily avail-
able —or by big companies operating in
New Guinea,
The same vehicles cannot now be
bought in New Guinea for less than £250.
Most of those dispatched to Australia
for • resale went on the blackmarket
immediately.
Apart from the belated balloting for
a number of decrepit buggies some
with pawpaw-trees sprouting from a
rusted interior —returned men, as such,
have not been considered in the sales
of disposals vehicles. Many of these
men needed no more than just such a
vehicle to set themselves up in inde-
pendence. —B. R. (N.G.).
Japanese Police
“’Arry Garto” (B. 14/1/’4B) is a bit
harsh on the Japanese police. I’ve fol-
lowed the Occupation through from the
time the Australians landed from Morotai
and I’ve watched the Jap. police do a
good job.
Consider the social upheaval involved
in a foreign occupation of a country and
with millions of their own nationals,
defeated men, returning home for dis-
charge. There has been little crime
through this period and the Japanese
have shown themselves a law-abiding and
disciplined people. They have adapted
themselves to the circumstances of the
occupation in a creditable way. In their
defeat, and in the lack of nearly every
essential commodity, the people have been
patient. They have not turned sour ot
sullen. There are everywhere signs of
steady hope and optimism. They are
willing to work and to start again and
rebuild. It is the spirit we have been
taught to admire.
The Japanese police have obviously
made no serious attempt to prevent black-
marketing in the sense of their people
buying from troops. Why should they?
As far as Australian troops are concerned
any sale of cigarettes or sweets to Japan-
ese for yen, which are usually spent in
Japanese shops for souvenirs, is only a
form of barter, though the soldier who
does so is disobeying R.Os.
But there is Uttle disgrace in these
transactions to Japanese who have no
other means of obtaining such goods as
tobacco, sweets and oils. —M. L. (Japan).
Bricklaying
What is it about bricklaying, that
causes every ill-informed critic to rush
into print with derogatory comparisons
between the bricklayer of yesteryear and
today (B. 28/1/’48)? In Victoria, this
takes the form of reiterating the old
parrot-cry —dating from the 1945 building
trade “go-slow strike” —that bricklayers
are nowadays only allowed by their union
to lay 300 bricks a day. That is as untrue
now as it was in 1945.
As for the number of bricks laid pre-
war and now, does it ever occur to critics
that types of building construction have
changed? The records of earlier brick-
layers were put up on thick walls where,
once the two sides were built up, bricks
could be thrown in with both hands.
Those walls are now put up in concrete.
With brick-veneer in favor (I speak
for Victoria) and no rough brick-
work to speak of, it is obvious that such
pre-war records cannot be equalled.
Further, a bricklayer building fireplaces
or putting in window-sills obviously can-
not average as many bricks per day as
one building straight walls
To criticise bricklayers for laying only
so many bricks a day nowadays, while
omitting to say what they are building,
is an absurd generalisation,—R; I. P.
(Vic.).
Stock Transport
Stock need not be damaged by fast-
running railways (B. 17/12/’47). Curves
can be flattened or realigned and similar
things done to prevent such damage,
while increasing speed. Simply by a
change to roller-bearings, one U.S. rail-
road proposes to cut a 60-hour stock
schedule to 32 hours. These things can
be done, and the only reason they aren t
done in Australia is that it wouldn’t pay
the Railway Department. That policy,
carried to its logical conclusion, would
permit any of our rural industries to
decay unless their operation enriched one
Government department.
An example of this absurdity is the
non-existent link between Charleville and
Blackall (Q.). That saves the department
an annual loss of £14,000, but it costs
the nation about a million a year in
drought losses.
Something must be done to stop the
rot in the stock business. Lord Vestey
has had his say about the N.T., where
development is a strategic and an
economic necessity, and a Bulletin
writer recently discussed the fattening ot
stock on the Cooper. Both stressed the
need for rail communication, but this
won’t be provided by tacking extra mile-
age on to the existing stems. No Com-
missioner would be prepared to accept
responsibility for the interest charges on
the capital involved.
The right approach to these problems
is to forget that we’re running a trans-
port system and remember that we’re
trying to develop a continent. Other-
wise we might just as well scrap the beef
industry while there is still something
left to scrap—Transporticus (Singa-
pore).
Private Enterprise
“Tidapa” (B. 11/2/’4B) apparently
has never read the history of Australia’s
progress under p.e., or studied the
balance-sheets of “public works” under
Government control. He solemnly asks
who finds the money that is sunk in State
ventures. Obviously he is not a taxpayer.
In theory it might be possible for a
Parliament of well-educated, high-minded
patriots to “take over” and “control” a
large number of complicated businesses
better than the experts who built them.
In practice it is impossible for a group
of inexperienced place-seekers, bossed by
a junta of self-elected citizens, to manage
huge industries of which they have no
technical knowledge.
Even horse-racing would wither away
if controlled through decrees by
Ministers whose chief aim was to eli-
minate competition and the profit motive.
If the present chaotic conditions don’t
convince “T.” of his error nothing will.
—Airways (S.A.).
Root of the Matter
“K.A.S.” (B. 18/2/’4B) should know
that love of the soil is not a characteristic
of Eurasians. That applies generally to
other mixed races in the East and the
Pacific. As mechanics, railway employees,
minor Government officials, routine
clerical workers, shop assistants, and so
forth, Eurasians are satisfactory—under
supervision and within the limits of their
education. But they are not farmers ; they
have little initiative or pioneering spirit.
They will continue to find a “niche” in the
new India as in the old, and very few
will leave the country. If our NT, is
ever to be settled, it will not be by half-
castes of any breed. Such people, as a
class, have no record of achievement in
any part of the world. —K. L. M.
(N.S.W.).
“Plain Australian” (B. 4/2/’4B) calls
the War Nurses’ Memorial Appeal
“an unnecessary burden” on a public
already “harassed” by “constant appeals.”
It isn’t. It’s a practical way of making a
real profession of a calling which, with
staff shortages in hospitals, is often just
housework'with a spot of nursing thrown
in. The centre will help nurses to be-
come better nurses, and give them a
status comparable to that which the Col-
lege of Surgeons helps to give to Aus-
tralian surgeons. As for hospitals, the
public will never be rid of appeals for
them until we get new hospitals built by
better architects, equipped with every
labor-saving device, run on the most
modern lines and admitting only patients
for medical or surgical treatment and
not sick people who want a place in
which to die. — Gah (Vic.).
Nothing better illustrates the failure of
official controls than the stocks seen in
Melbourne shops. There are hundreds of
new houses round the city which are
held up by the lack of essentials, from
cement and nails to sinks, electrical fit-
tings and hinges, and there is no hope
of the leeway being made up for at least
five years. But the interior of any hard-
ware shop or emporium looks like Mr.
Chifley’s Golden Age. There is every
variety of unessential gadget, from plas-
tic bathmats to 150 different types of
coal-scuttle. One hardware shop I visited
had only one size of nails in stock, but
its counters were heaped with a glittering
array of fancy doorknobs of all shapes
and sizes.—L. L. (Vic.).
Victorian Ms.P. are clamoring for a
pay-rise, and, if the pay of other State
politicians is any guide, there is some
justification for it. Salaries were last in-
creased in 1944, Assembly members get-
ting an increase from £5OO to £650 and
Council members a rise from £2OO to
£350. That left them with only half the
payroll of their N. S. Wales brothers.—
M. G. S-. (Vic.).
Recently - knighted Charles Lowe,
chancellor of Melbourne’s University,
told an A.N.A. smoke-social that the
Australian Government should study the
early pioneering “socialistic” programme
before it gets in too deep. If the Gov-
ernment did look back at the records it
would see that although the Crown
“owned the lot” in Phillip s day the
people did work.— Waddlin’ Willie
(Vic.).
“Mac’s” experience with corrugated-
iron (B. 11/2/’4B) parallels one I have
just had with wire-netting. A neighbor-
ing poultry-farmer had some birds to
dispose of, and I had all the necessary
equipment except for a few rolls of wire-
netting. I made the usual round of the
departments, filled in the usual form and
put it in at a leading hardware mer-
chant’s. The assistant was turning over
his records when a name caught his eye.
“You already have an application in,” he
said. He was right, but, not unnaturally,
I had forgotten it—it was two years old.
