THE RED PAGE
Shakespeare upon the Birth-Rate Problem.
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
Now is the time that face should form another ;
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the wbrld, unbless some mother.
For where is she so fair whose unear’d womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
Of his self-love,, to stop posterity ?
Thou art thy mother’s glass, and she in thee
Calls back the lovely. April of "Mr prime :
So thou through windows of thine, age shall see
Despite of wrinkles this thy. golden time.
But if thou live, remember’d not to be.
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Then let not winter’s ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill’d :
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
With beauty’s treasure, ere it be self-kill’d.
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
That’s for thyself to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one ;
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refiuured thee :
Then what could death do, if thou should’st depart,
Leaving thee living in posterity ?
Be not self-will’d, for thou art much too fair ,
To be death’s conquest, and make worms thine
heir.
' As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
And that fresh blood which youngly thou be-
stowest
Thou may’st call thine when thou from youth
convertest.
Herein lies wisdom, beauty and increase;
Withput this, folly, age and cold decay:
If all were minded so, the times should cease
And threescore years would make the world away.
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
Harsh, featureless and rude, barrenly perish :
Look, whom she best endow’d she gave the more ;
Which bounteous gift thou should'st in bounty
cherish :
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
Thou should’st print more, nor let thy copy die.
0 that you were yourself ! but, love, you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live :
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give.
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination ; then you were
Yourself again after yourself’s decease,
When, your sweet issue your sweet form should
bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honor might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter’s day
And barren ragfe of death’s eternal cold ?
O, none but unthrifts ! Dear my love, you know
You had a father : let your son say so.
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme ?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens yet unset
With virtuous wish would hear your living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
So should the lines of life that life repair,
Which this, Time’s pencil, or my pupil pen,
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
And you must live, drawn/ by your own sweet
skill.
[From The Sonnets .]
HOW “HAMLET” WAS WRITTEN
SYDNEY LEE, to whom there is no
other god but Shakespeare, contrives
in another volume of essays, Shake-
speare and the Modern Stage (Constable 95.),
tp go over the tailings of Shakespearian legend
with a still finer rake, and disinter yet a few
unrecorded irrelevant specks of gold. We
have the few broad facts of his life to work
on, and we have his plays. Surely this is
enough for English literature. Yet we may
spare a little sympathy for so diligent and so
devout an historian as Sydney Lee : it must
he a thankless and not too remunerative job,
this looking for nuggets among the tailings
of a long-worked-out literary mine. We
would like him to transfer his diligence and
his enthusiasm to more profitable ground.
Ibsen, Shaw, and Hillhouse Taylor are not
yet finally explored.
However, Lee makes one aspect of
Shakespeare clearer—his assured popularity
during his life-time, and for a generation
afterwards ; though we may, be permitted to
doubt whether that public esteem was due
to the / finer and more enduring qualities of
his plays, or to that immediate appeal to the
groundlings which this consummate dra-
matist knew so well how to make. Lee
portrays Shakespeare as a restrained, busi-
ness-like craftsman—the conventional suc-
cessful Englishman of his day, pleasing alike
his audience at the Globe and his Sovereign,
getting frequent “command” performances
from Elizabeth and James, and getting well
paid for them, and retiring at last to his
native town, there to become a person of
importance and wealth, with a new house,
as befitted the successful son of a worthy
tradesman, who had been also an alderman
and a high-bailiff of Stratford. Yet, while
sanely picturing for us the man that Shake- ,
speare probably was, Lee persists in an atti-
tude of humble idolatry to his god that is
rather irritating. Hamlet is a great play ; but
Shakespeare designed it to fill his theatre —
just as he designed his other plays as com-
mercial enterprises ; and in Hamlet, as in
his other plays, he “ got” his public. (By the
way, that prince’s real name was A inlet, yet
when a person happens to mention him
without the aspirate superior persons scoff.)
Somewhat unaccountably, in his meticu-
lous working over of the historical tailings,
Lee has overlooked a Shakespearian “find”
of the first importance. It is our pleasing
duty to bring to his notice a newly-dis-
covered authoritative account of the genesis
of Hamlet, written apparently by an eye-
witness behind the scenes at the Globe—
probably Bacon. We shall have much plea-
sure in forwarding the manuscript to Sydney
Lee for examination. Somehow, we suspect
there is a cryptogram in it. Except in the
modernisation of the spelling, we present it
exactly as it was written :—•
J*
One afternoon in 1602 Will Shakespeare was
standing in the wings making up for his part as
the mob in Julius C'ics'nr —Will was excellent as a
mob—when Burbage, the actor-manager, who had
“created” most of Will’s great 'characters,-came
round from the box-office and, without remark,
handed him 2s. lid. This was Will’s share for
the afternoon’s performance. It was a thin house
a good deal of it desperately “ papered,” and
Will was not surprised. Still, he could not help
reflecting upon the interest he had to pay for that
loan from the Stratford Corporation, and the
expenses of upkeep of his new house, and the
difficulties Mrs. Shakespeare seemed to find in
keeping down the butcher’s bill. If Julius didn’t
draw better—evidently the public were getting
tired of the assassination ; it was hard to know,
these days, really what they did want —it was
quite possible that Annie would carry out her
threat to run up to London and take him by the
ear. She always declared* that he spent all his
wages at “The Mermaid.”
“ The fact is,” said the actor-manager sourly,
“ the public are tired of history. Why can’t you
give us something like The Merry Wives ov The
Two Gents again—something with plenty of
knock-about fun and a few fights in it'? Fun and
fights—that’s what the public wants, my boy.
You literary chaps are apt to forget that. Look
at the houses we had to see Falstaff put into a
dirty-clotlies basket! There’s a scene that will
live , my boy. I’ve a good mind to bring The
Shrew up to date, myself.”
Will pretended to look hurt.
“ That’s all you did with it yourself, my boy,”
Burbage tolerantly went on. “You took an old
play and put in a few good speeches, and
changed the title from ‘The Taming of a
Shrew ’ to ‘ The Taming of the Shrew ’ ; and
I put it to you. my boy, that it doesn’t
take a great dramatist to think out a thing
like that. Now, haven’t you got some old thing
in The Two Gents style about you that we could
put on next week ? Something bright and lively,
and spectacular, and not too historical; and some-
thing with fewer scenes in it. You’ve not for-
gotten, I hope, that you cost me 13s. Id. for
painting signboards in Henry Five / You might
consider the expenses of management, my boy.”
Will pondered. “The fact is,” he said, defer-
entially wriggling under the weight of Burbage's
fat hand on his shoulder, “ I’m at work on a play
now.”
“Original?” queried Burbage sharply.
“Well ... practically,” assented Will.
The actor-manager turned sadly away. “ Won’t
do, my boy. You know the public won’t stand
anything new.”
“It isn’t exactly new in plot,” admitted Will
eagerly. “It’s the treatment that I call my
own.”
“Ha! that’s better. What’s it called ? ”
“ Hamlet. Silly title, I know,” he hurriedly
added.
“ Hamlet ?” said Burbage suspiciously.
“Haven’t I heard of him before? Wasn’t there
a play of that name . . . ? ”
“ Produced fourteen years ago. It had a great
run ; but most people have forgotten about it by
now. I thought of reviving it and bringing it
up-to-date a little.”
“ Thought you said it was original.”
“Only in treatment.”
• “Oh, that’s all right. -The public can stand
original treatment, only you mustn’t give ’em
anything original in plots. I've often admired
the way you do rehash things, Will. There was
Richard Three,-, you stole him from Holinshed’s
Chronicle. And As You Like A—judging from
the box-office receipts, the public didn’t like it:
you got that from Lodge. And Aomeo : you took
him from Arthur Brooke. And now this Ham-
let:
“I didn’t get him from the play, except the
arrangement of the scenes and a few speeches,”
protested Will. “I got it from a book called The
Hysteric oj Hamlet.”
“Sometimes I think you’re working Holinshed
and that crowd a bit too hard, my boy ; still it’s
safer than being original. After all, it isn’t the
treatment of it that the public cares too ales about;
it’s the play. The play’s the thing ! ”
“Excuse me, Mr. Burbage,” exclaimed Will,
excitedly grabbing the prompt script, “that’s a
good line, ‘ The play’s the thing ! 5 I think, if you
don’t iniud, I’ll stick it in ? ”
Burbage beamed. “Certainly, my boy, always
glad to collaborate. Stick it in—and you might
give that line to Me.”
Will smiled serenely. He was always smiling
serenely, except when he was cast for a mob, and
then he sulked.
“Got a fat part for me?” .asked the actor-
manager. “ I Want something that’s not killed
off so early as Julius. I’d like to have a good long
soliloquy. ”
“ Hamlet does nothing else.”
“Ha ! That’s right. You’re waking up, my
boy. Haven’t I always told you that you must
write round your actors? The public pays to see
Me, and its troubles whether I am Romeo or
Henry Five ! But, look here, how old is
Hamlet ? ”
“I’ve not quite settled that. Suppose I put
him down as twenty-five ?”
“Couldn’t do it, my boy. I’ve been —er —
maturing a bit lately. It didn’t matter much as
Julius ; bur. a thin youth of ”
“I could make him—er—plump.”
“Not stout, of course; but plump and well-
rounded. That’s right. The public don’t care
about skinny heroes.”
Will noted down his instructions with a careless
smile.
“ Now about the heroine ? ” pursued Burbage.
‘■‘•There isn’t much heroine.”
Burbage beamed. “That’s a good fellow!
You’ve been spreading yourself lately on heroines,
and the. public won’t stand it. It isn’t fair to the
profession. I can’t depend on that lad, Heminge,
after his bad break: as Juliet. He’s too fond of
ale, and you remember at the first performance of
Romeo , he insisted to the prompter that there
were two balconies. And he had no right to hurl
the Nurse from the balcony on top of me. But I
would have forgiven him even that if he had only
been sober enough to shave before he came on.
It don’t matter for the Nurse, but bow can I
apostrophise a Juliet • who’s got a three days’
beard? We 11 have to go slow on heroines, my
boy.”
“I could make her mad,” suggested Will,
serenely.
“ Yes, and if he’s drunk the audience won’t
know the difference. Will, I’ve always said
you’re a genius ! Now as to plot. Any mur-
ders ?”
“ Two or three.”
“ Not enough, my boy.”
“ Oli, I could easily kill off a few more—in the
last act. ”
“Well, do your best.”
Will took a note, then hesitated. “There’s a
ghost,” he said,
“H’m. I don’t think much of your ghosts.
We’ve rather tired the public with ghosts lately.”
“ But this ghost is quite different.”
‘‘ Your newest ghost always is,” affably assented
Burbage. “ Got the. script on you ? ”
He had. He left the actor-manager with it as
he rushed on the stage to be a mob. When he
had shouted himself hoarse, he found Kemp, the
principal comedian, waiting for him in the wings.’
“I hear you’ve got a new play. Will?” he
beamed. “Good part for me, 1 hope?”
“As a matter of fact there isn’t much for you to
do. There’s a grave-digging scene, t thought,
perhaps, you might like that.”
“Grave-digging ! Tragic, Ha !” The comedian
gurgled with joy. “That’s gentlemanly of you,
Will. What I really can do da tragedy-: but,
Burbage won’t admit it, Jealousy—professional
jealousy 1 So he keeps me clowning—and clown-
ing is beneath a man who believes in his art.”
Will looked anxious. “I’m -Sorry, but this
grave-digger is comic—comic relief. You see ”
“.Gomic ! ” gasped the comedian. “ And how
often am I on ? ”
“There's one scene—but we might make.it
two. But you’ll fetch the house ! ”
Kemp groaned. “I, a grave-digger ! I who
starred as Falstaff ! ”
They were joined by Burbage, with the script
in bis hand.
“ I say, my boy,” he paternally said, “ there’s
a lot of dreary long speeches for the Ghost.
Never met such a talkative ghost in my life.
You’ll have to cut it, my boy.”
Shakespeare blushed.' “1... I was thinking
of playing Ghost myself.”
‘‘Well, as you’re the author, I suppose we’ll
have to give you a bit of ‘fat’—or you’ll be want-
ing to cut down Hamlet. Now, how long will it
take you to fix this up?”
“ You can have the thing to-morrow. IT get
Marlowe to give me a hand with it to-night at
‘ The Mermaid.’”
“If you go to ‘The Mermaid ’ to-night, my
boy,” said Burbage severely, “you won’t have
it finished for a fortnight. By the way, what was
that thing you recited there the other night ? It
sounded all right—something about a bare bod-
kin. ...”
“ ‘To be, or not to be ?’” suggested Will.
“ Oh, that —— ! I wrote that for an idea I have
fora psychological tragedy I mean to write—none
of these stage-plays that are after a
month’s run ; but something great; something I
could leave for posterity.”
“Don’t want it, my boy. You stick to the sort
of stuff you’re doing—this sort of stuff. That’s
good enough for the Globe. And, on the whole,
you’ve had very good runs. What more can a
fellow want? Posterity! Well, stick in that
bodkin speech, my boy. It’s too good to be left
to posterity. Give it to Hamlet.”
“But it has nothing to do with Hamlet,” pro-
tested -Will.
“ That don’t matter. Stick it in.”
Will groaned ; then, remembering himself,
smiled serenely.
.“ Mob, please ! ” called the call-boy, and Shake-
speare sulkily sidled on to the stage.
o
Frank Hamilton, in his essay on the Australian
of the Future (writes “Ignis Via”), gives him-
her 74 attributes. I hereby implore permission
to make the number 75 by adding “originality.”
He certainly permits the Australian of the two
thousandth year to be practical, but practicability
and originality are not full brothers. I refuse to
see how 93 years can destroy the Australian’s
power of originating things, other than Sin. In
the circumstances kindly add “original” to the
original copy.
“ These are poor echoes, doggerel rhymes,” re-
marks the authoress —if he isn’t an authoress he
ought to be—of Gum Reaves, Old and New (Wm.
Brooks, Sydney). They are.
The only thing worth noting about The Light of
Life, by .1 as. A. Rqss (Wm. Brooks, Sydney), is
that the poet lives in Katoomba.
HI LL !
The hint thrown out that perhaps a. writer might
complete the story beginning with “-Hell !” has
been taken by lmlf-a-dozen contributors, though
none of them followed the advice given to put
their Hell to simmer for a month in the
bottom of a drawer. We quote the best effort
submitted, though it will be seen that it cannot
be commended, as a model for the short story :
“ Hell! ” said the Duchess, who had previously
taken no part in the conversation.
“Rats !” cried the Prince.
Each glared angrily at the other, and there
was a silence that could have been 'cut with a
meat-axe. - . ~ , ..
“His Royal Highness avails .In m.self of his
extensive vocabulary,” observe^' v ~ e Duchess, with
a strained sweetness. “ Possible*” she continued,
“ His Royal Highness was annoy SI at my reference
to his future home.”
At this scathing-remark the Prince sneezed
contemptuously in the face of the Duchess, and,
turning on his heel to hasten away, tripped over
the gramophone, to the accompaniment of trium-
phant peals of laughter from the Duchess.
But her triumph was short-lived. At that
moment the door burst open and there dashed in
Mr. Judkins and Ada Ward. “ Sinful wretch,”
squeaked the former, “ at last have I
(To be continued in our next.)
+
T. D. Mutch makes a few addenda to our sug-
gestions re the writing of the short story. He
advises that when the writer has put his story
away in the bottom drawer for a month, he should
lock that drawer. Somebody might be looking
for curl-papers. “And when it doesn’t come
back ? Don’t flatter yburself that it has been
accepted. Perhaps the editor has mislaid it.
Perhaps he hasn’t had time to read it. Perhaps
the office boy, to whom it was handed for return,
put it into his lunch-bag to read going home
in the tram, and the tram jibbed or some-
thirig, with the result that the' MS. came-- in
handy for wrapping pieces of office-boy in. Per-
haps," but perhaps not. It has come back!
What’s that big red inked D, scribbled across the
title, mean? It means Declined. What’s that
big blue-pencilled R through the opening line?
It stands for Refused or Rejected, and means that
you will have to re-write that first sheet, and
perhaps the whole lot. Very well, then, re-write
it, cheerfully. Get some more stamps and send
them off again. Now-, get a pipe, a knife, some
matches, and a plug of tobacco, and look for some
new ideas in the smoke. It would he as well to
get a half-dozen plugs of tobacco. When you have
finished the tobacco, get an axe and go to work.”
Stewart Edward White, the author of those
vivid and interesting stories of Hudson’s Bay,
Conjurer's House., The Blazed Trail, and The Silent
Places, has forsaken the Far North that he knows
so well, and, with a collaborator, Samuel Hopkins
Adams, has deliberately gone in for the Treasure
Island business. Treasure-islanding is popular
just now. Quiller Coucli'has his Poison Island on
the market, and White-Adams make an equally
vigorous bid for public support with The Mystery
(Hodder and Stoughton, per Sydney Book Club).
All that need be said of The Mystery is that it has
all the ingredients of the mystery novel combined
with a little of the new scientific discoveries
It is not so psychologically interesting as another
sea-story, Jack London’s The Sea Wolf; but
even the inveterate novel-reader will be compelled
to take the story in one gulp. The critic need
not further dally ; but if only White would drop
his partner in excitement, and go back the blazed
trail into the silent places that he has made us
know so well. . . ! E 3.
Apropos of the recent competitive essays con-
cerning the Australian of the Future (“J.A.”
remarks), it is interesting. to find what a wide
mental and physical range is given its inhabitants
of the past by navigators and romancists of pre-
settlement days. It was in our midst that Bacon,
in his New Atlantis, located his ideal nation,
with its advanced learning and model government.
Dampier, on the other hand, more truthfully de-
scribed the natives he saw on the north-west coast
as belonging to the lowest type of humanity.
Swift, in Gulliver’s Travels, places the famous
Lilliputians somewhere in the vicinity of Spencer’s
Gulf (“to the north-west of Van Diemen’s
Land”); while, in striking contrast to the
puppets of the dean’s imagination is Tasman’s
statement that the aborigines of Van Dieman's
Land were a veritable race of dusky giants. From
which it would appear that the misrepresentation
of Australia and its people in Europe is a pretty
hoary institution. '
The Athenceum (London), in a critical notice of
the R.A., speaking of George W. Lambert’s
work, which by other papers has been claimed as
one of the pictures of the year, remarks upon the
simplicity and massiveness of his work : “No one
exhibiting at the Academy has more delight in
the luxurious handling of a full body of paint. In
pursuit of grateful simple sheets of color to spread
over his canvas, he is tending more and more to
place his groups all in one plane. He is thus
driven to pad out the meagre structural basis of
his pictures by odd devices for furnishing them
with a semblance of variety of form. In his
Portrait Group he loops up a baby’s dress to
show its legs ; he dresses his bigger boy in an im-
probable combination of overcoat and under-
clothing ; and when all is done the thing
has a certain fundamental monotony, a
want of depth of form. We are sorry to
see a somewhat narrow pictorial ideal cramping
the development of so able a man, for in other
fields Mr. Lambert shows that his powers of
design are by no means so narrow, so studio-
bound, as they appear in his exhibition pictures.
Mr. Lambert seems to spend some of his leisure
in supplying sensational illustrations for popular
magazines. These are necessarily of varying
quality, but the best are extr>V>rdinarly good. A
drawing in The Pall Mall Magazine, a month or so
back, representing a couple of workmen fallen
among some scaffolding, appeared to us to reach
perfection within the limits of work of the kind.”

OLD MAN!!
DO YOU FEEL
UNWELL ?
TAKE COURAGE!
£1 Os. is sufficient to send for a cure in most cases.
DO NOT ABANDON HOPE. All is not yet lost. Our system of cure (which is sent
to you in sealed package safe from observation) has lifted many from the brink of
despair. It will save you. Write to us freely and frankly telling your symptoms,
and we will, in return, forward on payment of £1 6s. a full treatment. “ The
Bulletin” Endorses our Cure.
Do you suffer from a feeling 1 of something dreadful about to happen to the Ma
State, a sense of loss, sites before the eyes, unnecessary irritation, nervous inability to see
straight, loss of reasoning power, bashfulness in the presence of honest men, a feeling
of fullness after reading the morning papers, shortness of sense ? Are you disinclined
for exertion ? Do you see wrongs to the Ma State in your sleep ?
All these symptoms point to the one conclusion. You are suffering from State Frights.
But courage. We can cure you. We have cured many worse cases.
READ THESE TESTIMONIALS FROM SYDNEY CITIZENS!
A State Premier writes
“ Two years ago 1 began to feel unwell. My tongue was forked. My statements were irregular.
I had Braddon blots before my eyes. I suffered from frightful dreams of the Ma State being
burned at the stake. Now, before taking your mixture lam just the same as ever. 1 refuse
to take your mixture.”
This shows how bad a sufferer can remain who does not take our mixture.
A Cured Young Man writes
“ Formerly I used to read only the morning papers. I was fast becoming worn to a shadow from
State Frights. I could retain no wholesome food. I saw everything yellow. I was becoming
a burden to all who came into contact with me. I was a real Mrs. Gummidge. Since taking
your treatment I am a cured man.”

The
Evidence
from 23, Lamb Street, Lilyfield,
Leichhardt, N.S.W., June 15 th,
1906 : —“My son Albert Leslie
suffered at various times
from diarrhoea, asthma,
pneumonia and bronchitis,
of which he had three
attacks in six weeks; in fact,
he was so weak that I did not
think he would recover. But
I gave him Scott’s Emulsion
and now he is restored to com-
plete good health, his flesh is
firm and solid and he has cut
two teeth without the least
trouble ; before taking Scott’s
Emulsion he suffered very
much while teething.”
(Mrs.) K. HART.
The Reason Why
He Recovered
Zi was the splendid nourishing
power of the pure Norwegian
(Lofoten) cod liver oil always
used in Scott’s Emulsion
which saved Albert Hart and
will do the same for }mur own
little one. This beautiful oil is
made so perfectly digestible by
the Scott process of manufac-
ture that the most delicate babe
can take it without a bit of
stomach trouble. Moreover,
the little ones soon
get to like Scott’s.
N.B. In buying
Scott’s look for
“the fishman

Bitter-Sweet.
The sacred fires are cold,
O Love ! 0 Heart of Gold !
Beyond the sobbing of the sundering sea
A spectre sits and waits
By memory’s bolted gates—
And calls, and calls across the years to me.
Nor wreath of rose, or rue
Fate wove for me or you.
The sands run out, the blackening brands expire
Where Passion sits and moans
With eyes as dry as stones,
Beside the ashes of her lost desire.
Nor spark shall warm the clay,
Nor gold shall gild the grey.
The harvest ripes for other hands to win ;
No more for Love’s dear sake
Shall the old sweet music wake
Where the “ glory sky ” leaned low on Cora Lynn.
The sacred fires are cold,
O Love ! O Heart of Gold !
Life’s red wine dyes the desert at our feet;
But aye from years behind
A restless, homeless wind
Comes laden with the scent of Bitter-sweet.

Deep-Sea Ships.
Where ’mid ragged coastal jumble
Sea-mews scream and spindrifts fly,
Curses of sea-vampires rumble
As deep-sea ships hurry by ;
Far a-down dark wave-washed tangles
Mermen dive for treasure-trove,
And a riot of breakers wrangles
Whitely round the shrinking cove.
Daring ships ! ’Mid wave-commotion
Some drift wildly, lured by spells ;
Save our women, spare them, Ocean,
From the deep-sea infidels !
Lest the scurvy scullions ravage,
Lest the vampire win his spoils,
Spare them from vast billows savage.
Save them from sea-daemons’ toils !
Bearded scavengers of sea-wrack
’Mid wild orgies dice for gold—
Plunder of still-quivering wreckage—
On the wine-corks in the hold ;
Gathered round them, clad in vestures,
Gauzy-tinselled amorous trulls
Proffer wine with luring gestures,
Blood-red wine in human skulls.
But good sea-folk bear earth’s daughters
To a labyrinthine lair.
And, deep down ’mid still, green waters,
Make new sea-weeds of their hair.
And while mermaids offer floral
Sacrifices to their charms,
Skilled sea-artists sculp new coral
Of red lips and snowy arms.
And when night-winds call their spirits
Wraiths far-guide them o’er the sea—
’Mid the wave-wash sailors hear its
Supplicating threnody ;
Love-lorn maid and reckless rover.
Sea-folk tend your chartless graves,
And, when deep-sea ships pass over,
Trick the vampires, lull the waves !

Absence.
In those dear days when you were common to my
eyes
And woven round my heart,
The glow in which we walked I did not recognise ;
But, now we dwell apart,
I am with a new wonder very wise.
When I could see you daily— how the memories
throng !
How close we drifted !—when
Your beauty through me flooded keenly like a
song
Newly remembered, then
I thought I loved you, sweetheart; I was wrong !
I did not guess the riches I so richly spent,
I counted no caress ;
Unseeing, blinded by the glory, I but went,
Patient of happiness,
From gladness to new gladness all content.
When every street held always the vague hope of
you—
Drawn like a helpless thing,
Somewhere unseen within the throng your heart,
I knew,
Was toward me eddying !
And the swift heart-leap when the hope came true!
When every day was opulent with you, to be
In the same world sufficed.
How every hour brought you, and how impatiently
Tryst hurried after tryst !
Now memories keep their laggard tryst with me.
Now that I only weave from those old memories
New themes, but not so fair
As those forgotten songs, those fading melodies
That in the old days were,
You with a keener sight my spirit sees.
Freed from your loveliness and unchained from
the bliss
That is upon your breast,
Out from the greying memories comes only this—
I love you ! Leave the rest!
And 10... upon my lips again your kiss !

TO ALFRED DEAKIN : WELCOME.
It is, for once, The Bulletin’s turn to be affable,
and to say to Alfred Deakin, Prime Minister of
the Commonwealth, “ Well done.” And in saying
that, The Bulletin can speak for all that is
worth while in Australia.
* * » *
It is not an ordinary thing to be called upon
to welcome an Australian statesman back from
London, bearing still his shield and armor.
The path to the world’s capital is strewn
with the bones of dead political reputa-
tions. Australians have left these shores for
London, full of faith in Australia and of an Aus-
tralian patriotism so fervent as to be infected
with narrowness ; and have returned looking
upon their native land as a mere satrapy of an
empire, instead of a nation in a great Confederation
of nations. There was Parkes, the ex-Chartist,
who, after seeing London, was, in his later days,
more concerned about the difference between his
G.C.M.G. and the mere K.C.M.G. of less be-
knighted persons than about all the life of Aus-
tralia. There was Graham Berry, “the red, raw
Radical,” who saw London and ended his days
with a title and the sentiments appropriate to that
title. There was Dibbs, who had talked from a
Domain cart-tail on Republicanism. Dibbs went to
London; was the rage there for a fashionable
season (in lack of a monkey who smoked, or a
Zulu king with 150 wives); and came back “ Sir
George Dibbs,” with the explanation that he had
to take the title to “oblige the lady.” These,
and many other instances of more recent date
which will be readily recalled, have taught Austra-
lians to dread the visits of .their political, leaders
to London, for always it seemed the occasion .was
taken for the exchange of a near Australian
interest for a title, or some other shoddy personal
gratification. Alfred Deakin comes back an
honorable exception, still without a title, with
the sacrificial stain of no Australian principle on
his hands, but with a record of gpcd work done,
and better work attempted and set in train for
future achievement.
* * * •
To have resisted the siren fascination of London
is no small glory. The great, grey city, peopled
with the innumerable ghosts of the mighty dead,
vested with the dignity of a population which
stretches to the numbers of a nation, garbed
in Imperial luxury, intoxicates, stupefies. There
have congregated the intellect, the art, the
music, the money of the earth. Does any nation
produce a great scholar, a sweet singer, a fine
painter, a giant capitalist ? London attracts him
by sheer force of gravity, and adds his greatness to
its splendors. In London, the past and the pre-
sent alike appeal. The vast weight of its
traditions bends the knee to instinctive rever-
ence. The great clamor of its millions deadens
the brain and seems to compel acquiescence with
their voice.
* * * *
It is easy to understand how, to the weak in
spirit, it would seem, under the spell of the mar-
vellous city, that to no higher destiny could a
colony aspire than to humbly serve this enthroned
magnificence; that the clamor of the London
populace is the voice of a god declaring immu-
table laws. Yet to yield to that spell is to go
the way of destruction. London is not the
Empire, is not even Britain, nor England.
To bow in idolatry to its voice is to be re-
creant to the true national spirit. No one
city can speak for all the cities of a great
Confederation, and perhaps least of all that city
which, from its very wonderfulness, has giyen so
many of its citizens the idea that it is the universe,
and has therefore become parochial; and which has
attracted the plutocrats of every nation to its plea-
sures, and has become therefore more cosmopolitan
than patriotic. But there is nothing astonishing
that so many Australians have capitulated to
London ; there is much that is grateful in the
fact that one Australian leader has conspicuously
upheld the standard of his country, and come un-
scathed from the sirens.
* * * *
The Commonwealth will now hope to see the
sturdiness which its Prime Minister displayed in
London continued in Australia ; to find that the
voyage to England has been a moral tonic to Mr.
Deakin to arouse him to make his leadership of
the new nation for the future more strenuous and
resolute. On no subject that was broached in
London did Mr. Deaicin speak irresolutely. He
seemed to shed all his affable desire to avoid causes
of antagonism. He fought for what he believed
in, not only with ability, but with determination.
Indeed, some of the newspapers thought him rude
in his resoluteness. We want a taste of that rude
Deakin in Australia, where the Commonwealth
has lately invited the attacks of the “stickit”
secessionists by its affability under insult; where
the progress of the nation has been delayed by
the tendency of the Government to wait until it
can do things without giving grave offence, for-
getting that to do anything in advancement of
Australia will fill with savage resentment some
anti-Australians. The Commonwealth has a warm
welcome for Alfred Deakin, who wasn’t affable in
London when it was necessary to be aggressive. It
will have a warmer welcome still, next elections,
for Alfred Deakin, if it is found that he has
not exhausted his aggressiveness in England, but
has some of it left for the local land monopolists, the
foreign-traders, and the pitiful Little Australians
who whine that this nation can never be self-
respecting, self-defending, but must for ever loaf
in degrading dependence on its ageing mother.
* • * *
Many points on which Alfred Deakin spoke
in London with admirable clearness need to be
impressed here too. For example, on May 16, on
the Defence question :
I believe with little delay you will see universal service
compulsory throughout Australia. (Cheers.) If it serves
only to direct the attention of our people upon the
questions involved in national defence, upon a study of
our obligations abroad to other communities, to the obli-
gations of the Empire, to the civilised world in which it
moves _if it only served to do this the time of compulsory
training spent by every man would be well spent.
(Cheers.) If you want a community sober, if you want a
community placable and reasonable, if you want a com-
munity which realises what war is, and what war means,
you must go to the community in which every man and
every household shares the risk of war. (Cheers.) While you
only pay for your defence you can afford to be interested
in reading about the spectacles that it presents. When
you share the responsibility, you will read that story
with quite other eyes and other sympathies. And surely
this is the nation we desire to see, slow to anger, and not
subject to passion, not played upon by individuals or
individual interests, but moving calmly, solidly and
unitedly when it is called upon to move at all. (Cheers.)
Such a nation commands the respect of the would-be
agoressor, because he realises what the action of such a
people means when they are unduly provoked, when the
conscience of the nation is awakened, and the judgment
of the nation responds, and the resort is to be the dread
arbitrament of war—the nation from which the aggressor
will shrink is the nation which has prepared itself in
peace, and faces, unmoved, all the sacrifices and risks of
war. (Loud cheers.)
There is no answering of these arguments. Like-
wise there is no honorable reason why the man
using them in London should not repeat them in
Sydney or Melbourne ; or why, having the power,
he should not translate words into deeds, and give
Australia a system of compulsory universal ser-
vice. Parliament would sanction ; the people
would approve. The only obstacle that can be
alleged is of cost. But since the cost is easily
bearable, it cannot be alleged in excuse of neglect
of duty. Australia must pay for its national
insurance like other nations.
* * * *
On many other points, which it would be tedious
to recapitulate, Mr.. Deakin may wisely bring his
London resoluteness to Australia. Its display
there has vested his name on this continent with
a new respect. Its further display here will win
him an even wider regard.
WANTED, A LEADER.
If N.S. Wales were a distinct choate personality
with a shilling to spare for the purpose in its
pocket, it would probably be to-day advertising—
TTTANTED, a political leader. No member of the
»’ present Parliament need apply.
N.S. Wales, as represented by its State Parlia-
ment, is a country which is quite careless of its
political honor, and which was not at all concerned
at the fact, that the Cabinet which insisted on
staying in office to muddle the Lands Scandals
through to a vague and unsatisfactory conclusion
was made up, as to a full quorum of its members,
of men whose names were “mentioned” a good
deal in connection with those very scandals. Yet,
as represented by the same Parliament, it is
exceedingly concerned about little matters of
State Frights and dignities, and is prepared to
secesh and revolush at any fancied slight or
grievance; and, moreover, is anti-Australian to
the core, anxious to harass the Australian union
at every juncture. And withal it is so reckless a
housekeeper, that it is not at all concerned that
debts are vastly increasing these three years,
whilst the revenue has been far greater
than before, and the legitimate outgoings
have been less. There is certainly a voice
crying out in its wilderness that he is a good
Federalist. The owner of the voice is O’Sullivan,
but he would be quite aptly called Lot, for all
the support he gets.
* * * *
Such is N.S. Wales, as represented by the
Macquarie-street Parliament. The N.S. Wales
of other tests is quite a different place.
At the last Federal elections all the
Deakin candidates who offered themselves (and
the platform was robust Australianism) were
triumphantly returned; three of them, Lyne,
Chapman, and Ewinq, being members of the
Ministry which is alleged to be bitterly oppressing
N.S. Wales. The N.S. W. wing of the Federal
Labor party under Watson not only returned all
its old members on a platform of militant
Federalism and financial honesty, but won several
new seats. The only party that was routed at
the polls was the very anti-Australian crowd
which yet commands the allegiance of the bulk
of the State Parliament.
* * * *
It is quite clear that the people of New South
Wales are antipathetic to the steady effort made
to keep the State in the position of a stumbling
block in the path of the Australian nation. It
follows, therefore, with absolute logical necessity,
that the State Parliament does not represent the
people. Reduce the thing to figures, which are
fair witnesses of the truth, seeing that N.S.W.
State Premier Carruthers now openly admits
that his organisation represents Reidism in Federal
politics. Before the last Federal elections the
state Of parties in the N.S-W. section of the
Federal Parliament (26 members) was : Reidites,
15; anti-Reidites, 11. That would be represented
in the State Parliament by : Carruthersites, 52;
anti-Carruthersites, 38. But, since the Federal
elections, the state of parties in the N.S.W. section
of the Australian Parliament (27 members) is :
Reidites, 11; anti-Reidites, 16. That would be
represented in the State Parliament by: Car-
ruthersites, 37; anti-Carruthersites, 53.
9 * »
On the figures, Carruthers has no right to a
majority. On the existing facts he is practically
sure of one, seeing that he is asked to answer no
serious challenge. According to the rules of the
game he has to meet McGowen in the fight for
power, and McGowen makes the fight a “sehlin-
ter” by refusing to join issue on any really im-
portant matter. On all the main points in
which Carruthers conflicts with N.S.W. public
opinion, McGowen agrees with Carruthers.
The situation clamors for a leader, who could
serve his own ambition by giving to N.S. Wales
the sort of politics the majority of its people
really want; who could serve his own State by
restoring it to its proper dignity and consequence
in the union ; and, finally, who could supremely
serve Australia by bringing into harmonious
partnership, for the Australian good, the Com-
monwealth and the most powerful of the indi-
vidual States. To such a leader, provided
he had the courage of his views and some skill to
represent them, there is a certain victory. N.S.
Wales does not want to be the sulky brat in a
corner of the Federation ; but the existing political
leaders are agreed that it will not be happy in any
other way. N.S. Wales would welcome the idea
of taking advantage of the present prosperous
seasons to stop the drift towards a hopeless
national debt; but all existing political parties are
agreed not to offer such a policy for approval.
« * * *
It is a mournful thing to think of, that such a
gorgeous opportunity awaits a claimant in vain.
There are so many silly and futile causes engaging
the attention of enthusiasts the world over-
enthusiasts who clamor over trifles like Veg
tarianism, and Penny Postage, and Juvenile
Smoking, and Marriage with a Deceased Wife’s
Sister, and Preservation of Native Beetles,
and the Lost Ten Tribes, and about getting
the Two Found Tribes back to Zion so that
they may not be lost, and Homes for Aged
Cabhorses, and the Width of Tyres, and the
Inspection of Scaffolding, and Rainmaking with
Guns. These and a thousand other things have
their earnest enthusiasts, who write, and talk,
and organise, and get into Parliament, and form
committees, and get up public meetings, and fuss
around like an overturned beehive, or a scalded
ant-heap, or a hen with a clutch of ducklings.
But, with all this enthusiasm going to waste,
there seems to be not one man with a gift of
plain speech and a habit of sticking to the point,
who is willing to become N.S.W. Premier by
advocating the politics of the majority of the
N.S.W. people. Isn’t the Ma State of as much
consequence as a Home for Aged Cabhorses ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Profits that are Not Profits.
If it means what it apparently does mean—and
what, at any rate, other companies accept it to
mean—the decision of the S. Australian Full
Court in a recent income-tax case against the
Wallaroo and Moonta Mining and Smelting Co.
is very deplorable. It may be good law ; but it
will not make for honest and sound finance. The
trouble was raised over the 1903 profits. In that
year the co. paid away £BOOO in dividends, and
made its income-tax return accordingly. But, as
it sent its published balance-sheet along with its
return, the Commissioner saw that, besides the
£BOOO of dividend, the co. had appropriated
£22,469 of “profits” for its depreciation reserve,
and had also spent £13,712 on its plant,
this sum being likewise provided out of so-
called profits. The Full Court decided that
income-tax was payable on all these amounts.
The Court went further, and declared that,
though no order could be made on these proceed-
ings for tax which should have been paid for the
years prior to 1903, yet “it would_ be a low
standard of ethics, which he (the Chief Justice)
would be sorry to attribute to the gentlemen of
high reputation having the management of the
company’s affairs, that could justify the with-
holding of payment of income-tax which had
escaped through the Taxation Department having
relied on the accuracy of the company’s re-
turns.” What the appeal to ethics may bring
into the Treasury is very uncertain ; but it
is estimated that the result of the appeal to
law will be a revenue windfall of over £40,000.
Now, what will the effect of this and subsequent
similar payments be? In the first place, what
are these moneys that are now declared taxable ?
The Court inferentially says they are profits.
With much respect, they are nothing of the sort.
They are no more profits than wages are. A man
buys a machine to do certain work, and in doing
that work it wears out until in, say, 10 years it is
valueless. It seems too clear to need arguing
that, in estimating the cost of production, the man
must allow for wear and tear of the machine. If it
cost £lOOO and lasts 10 years, then (disregarding
interest earnings on the reserve) an annual £lOO
for wear and tear of the machine is as much part
of the cost of production as wages paid are. If a
man puts aside the £lOO, he doesn’t add that to
his capital. His machinery is worth £lOO less;
so that, instead of having his capital repre-
sented by machinery, he has it partly repre-
sented by a depreciation reserve, which is
being accumulated to replace the machinery when
it becomes utterly valueless. To tax the legiti-
mate additions made to that reserve is to
discourage the provision of a reserve ; and sound
and honest finance calls loudly, not for the dis-
couragement of depreciation reserves, but for
their encouragement. Every month men whose
business it is to follow the movements of joint-stock
companies find cases in which excessive dividends
have been paid simply through neglecting to pro-
vide out of revenue for the renewal of machinery
and appliances ; with the result that, in the end,
shareholders find that they have been eating up
their capital, and that to carry on they must pro-
vide capital to replace that which has been con-
sumed. That means that, while the fictitious
profits are being declared, prices of stock are in-
flated ; then comes awakening, collapse, and in
many cases ruin. The S. Australian Full Court
could not have intended to encourage that sort of
thing; yet that must be the inevitable effect of
its decision, unless Parliament comes to the
rescue.
The New Protection.
There are constantly being ventilated hardships
arising from the fact that, while the question of
Customs Protection is in the hands of the Federal
Government, which can thus deal with Australia
as a whole, factory legislation is in the hands of the
States. The State which tries to give adequate
protection to the worker is therefore subjected
to the unfair competition of the State where the
employer pays just what he pleases. The other
day a Melbourne firm shifted its cigar-making
factory to Adelaide, to escape the Wages Board ;
and another shifted its jam-making business to
Tasmania, for the same purpose. But, although
the Federal Parliament cannot, unfortunately,
pass a Factories Act, it can get to the
same place by another road. It is doing
this at the present time, in connection with
the Agricultural Implements industry. When
the Act raising the duties on those articles was
before the House, an Excise duty equal to the New
Protection was imposed, with the proviso that the
Excise was not to be enforced against those manu-
facturers who paid fair wages. The result, of
course, has been a rush of implement-makers,
from all the States, for certificates of exemption ;
and the upshot of the whole business will be the
establishment, in all the States , of fair wages in
the agricultural implement trade. What can be
done in one direction can be done in another. A
similar provision in any other protected industry
would put things on a fair and level footing at
once. And, until each State passes a decent
Factories Act, this condition should be attached
to practically all protected industries. No doubt
Carkothers will rave against the proposal, but
as he raves against everything Federal that
oughtn’t to make any difference.
+
The Ma City of the Ma State.
“ A.P.” writes, with much truth in his writing
The “discontent with Federation” is not aN.S. Wales,
but a Sydney, matter. And it is just an attempt to
repeat, at the cost of Australia, the tactics by which the
“Ma City ’’ of N.S. Wales has impoverished and ham-
pered the rural districts for its own selfish advantage.
Here, are some facts. The freights from Newcastle to
Sydney are reduced to a minimum, to prevent goods
leaving the train at Newcastle to travel by sea to Sydney.
It does not pay the railways to reduce rates by half, and
shipment by sea does not hurt Sydney, as the goods ulti-
mately come there ; but it hurts Newcastle, and that is
something gained. Again, for the past 15 years, the rail-
way authorities have fought against the Wellington-
Werris Creek connection, and every other proposed
branch from the northern line which would bring trade
to Newcastle; yet they readily assented to the Dubbo-
Coonamble and'Mudgee-Dunedoo lines, which bring trade
to Sydney. Compare the map of any civilised State with
that of N.S.W. ! For instance, glance at the map of
Queensland, with feeding lines running! inland from the
chief ports, and then examine N.S.W.’s railway system
showing an utter absence of such lines.
The neglect of Twofold Bay by the N.S.W. Government
is notorious. This harbor is among the finest in the
world, and 50 miles inland is the Monaro, a well-watered
and extensive tract unrivalled in Australia for fertility.
It does not pay to cultivate there, as the freights to Syd-
ney run to over £5 per ton, and those rates will not be
much lessened by the proposed Bojnbala line. By running
a line to Twofold Bay from Monaro, Sydney could be
reached at £1 10s. per ton. This line would undoubtedly
pay, and the Monaro would become a veritable granary,
instead of being a sheep-walk, as at present. (Meanwhile
Gobbagombalin, and other places near the lid of Hades,
are being “ closely settled.”) Parties, the statesman,
placed the cost of constructing this Twofold Bay line on
the Estimates 15 .years ago, just before he went out of
power. At present the Bay is practically destitute of
shipping. The loneliness of that capacious stretch of
water, which is still the playground of the whale and
grampus, whilst the eastward horizon is black with the
trailing funnel fumes of passing vessels, shows the policy
of the Ma city.

Horror —will yet result in the “killing of the

the Bright Thought was cabled out here by the
solemn ass at the London end of the wire. But
what is there in the fact that a stout Jewish
person, sitting behind an inordinate quantity
of money, jewellery and plated goods, has made
the same mouldy old generalisation re Sosh that
every other stout person with much money is
wont to make at short intervals nowadays ? It is
the special reference to the foolishness of Roose-
velt’s interfering with such cheerful examples of
practically unrestricted private enterprise as are
afforded by the swindling rebating U.S. A. railway
cos. and their bosses, that arouses comment.
Harriman, the Railroad King (one of the select
body of U.S. A. millionaires, who has been pub-
licly denounced as a liar by the President),
either owns or controls (absolutely or in part)
one-third of all the railways in Uncle Sam’s
country, and is a fair type of his class. His rail-
ways siay more people in any given year than the
Socialistic railways of Australia do in 15 years.
Often, when it is a good year in Harriman’s
butchering department, his lines kill more people
than all the Socialistic Australian railways do in
30 years. It has been grimly suggested to Harri-
man that if he would tin his slaughtered passenger
there would be money in the business. The
management, in other regards, from a business
point of view, is appalling. Trade has been suffered
to outrun the equipment on most of the
lines, and those in control have not been
able for months past to meet the demand on their
roads. The revelations in the recent Standard Oil
trials, of the conspiracies and criminal practices in
restraint of trade, which are a regular feature
of Yankee railway business, have impelled Roose-
velt to urge the Inter-State Commission to watch
the railway cos., and other monopolies of the
kind, and see that they swindle and black-
mail’the public as little as possible. This is
annoying to the railway and other cos., as it puts
them to the additional expense of employing
costly lawyers—to watch the Inter-State Com-
mission. And so, scattering in its wake a trail
of dead and dying, pursued by the curses of those
who can’t afford to pay it bribe money, and with
a sheaf of indictments ever hovering in the imme-
diate offing, the criminal U.S.A. railway system
forges onwards. Rothschild and other people
of that sort, who have lent money to the railway
bosses, may fulminate against the “ Socialism ”
that seeks to limit such Private Enterprise
criminality. But that won’t hurt Socialism.


Naval Defence.
Apart from the impertinent chatter of the
Sydney pro\ incialists who are opposed to an Aus-
tralian navy for the same reason as they are
opposed to everything else that is Australian,
there is a body of serious argument against the
necessity for the creation of such a fleet which has
to be met and refuted. The task is not hard.
The British “ Blue-Water School,” its mind
nourished mainly on the books of a Yankee
alleged expert, Mahan, who has the Yankee
weakness for a cure-all specific, argues
It is necessary for Britain to hold supreme command of
the sea. The sea-borne trade is vital to the life of the
Empire. The free entry of food ships is vital to the
existence of Britain. . .
To hold supreme command of the sea it is necessary
not merely to defend one’s own Coasts, but to be able to
search out and destroy the enemy’s fleet wherever it
may be. Britain must have a navy equal to any possible
combination that it might be called upon to meet. That
navy must be stationed so as to be quickly mobilised at
the point where the enemy is likely to be—at present in
European waters.
That’s the “Blue-Water School” faith in a few
sentences. According to it, Great Britain doesn’t
really need an effective army for home defence ;
for, if the navy is defeated, all is lost. For the
same reason Australia needs no coastal-defence
fleet or effective army. When the cable comes
through—if cables can come through—tha.t the
British fleet has won off Heligoland or Yoko-
hama, Australia will be safe. If the cable runs
the other way, that the British fleet has lost, the
Australians must prepare to be Germans, or Japs,
or Chinese. It’s rather a dismal sort of national
faith, and against its articles The Bulletin puts
forward these: —
It isn’t necessary for Britain to “ give up ” if the com-
mand of the sea is lost. Provided there is a reliable army
defending British territory, and the British nations over
the seas can do something to defend themselves, “ the
Empire ” will still have a good chance, and can prepare
for another struggle for sea mastery.
Trade isn’t vital to the life of “ the Empire.” Trade is
a very desirable thing, of course, and Britain would lose
a lot of money if its coasts were blockaded ; but a nation
worthy of the name should be able to do without trade
for a year or so at a pinch. Anyhow, if it can’t, it won’t
live.
There is no reason why the food ship should be essential
to Britain. With a sane fiscal policy, Britain should be
able to provide for itself, at a pinch, all the main necessi-
ties of life. Until that condition is established, the
British national position must be precarious, even if
Britain has a navy twice the present size.
The ideal of keeping up a navy which can surely whip
any possible combination is, financially, a hopeless one.
From present indications, a two-Power standard navy
will shortly be impossible, and three or even four Powers
may combine to loot the British Empire.
Australia, anyhow, doesn’t want to pin its national
existence to any Yankee cure-all notion. It can live,
and thrive, so long as its own territory is kept free of
enemies, alid isn’t inclined to allow its fate to be decided
by a naval battle in the North bra or the Atlantic. It is
a darned poor nation that gives up after one defeat-
even one huge defeat.
; As a collection of axioms, these look at least a
I little better than those of the “Blue-Water
School.” There is more fact in them, more
optimism and more real patriotism. The “ Blue-
Water” confession of national faith won’t hold
water of any sort on examination. Were it to
happen that, say, Germany and Japan formed a
combination against Britain, and, before a move
i was made by Germany, Japan moved its fleets
against Australia, would Britain strip its home
waters to “search out and destroy” the Japanese
fleet? Such a folly is not in the least likely. The
I “ Blue-Water ” scheme of defence—supposing a
great war to involve Britain—would resolve itself
into a hurried mobilising of the whole British
navy to defend the shores of Britain and the
| Atlantic food route, in an effort to defend the
; centre of the Empire—an effort made desperate
by the fact that Britain had no food supply and
no effective army.
The Anti-Birth-Rate Party.
It is a year or two since Secretary Walpole, of
the Victorian Employers’ Federation, remarked
| that marriage was a luxury for the working-man.
• A , week or two back, one of the employers’
j myrmidons in Westralia told a press interviewer,
| in relation to the ability of a timber worker tO‘
keep his wife and children on the combine’s wage,
that “ we don’t employ the wives and children.”
Still more recently a married woman, petitioning
in the Sydney Divorce Court, testified that hqr
husband, a clerk in the A.J.S. Bank, had
been dismissed by that institution because he
married, there being a rule that no employee
should marry until he had attained the dizzy
financial eminence of £2OO a year. All these
facts go to show that Secretary Walpole’s asser-
tion, which he has since tried hard to explain,
away, simply embodied a recognised principle in
the Tory mind that the man who does its work
and makes its profits for it, should be paid just,
sufficient to keep him fit for those purposes, and
that he has no right to expect a remuneration,
sufficient to maintain other persons. Capital, in.
effect, regards the worker just as man has been
accustomed to regard the beast of burden.
The modern capitalist, typified by the Vic. Em-
ployers’ Federation, the Westralian Timber
Combine, and the A.J.S. Bank, can be compared
with nothing but the potentate who has charge of
the eunuchs of Constantinople. Therefore, the
Tory gentlemen who are for ever canting about
the decline of the birth-rate should pause in their
frenzy to ascertain what the rate might have been
had their own financial institution refrained from
augmenting their dividends and profits at the
birth-rate’s expense*. In the case of the bank a
side-issue arises. It is questionable whether the .
: A.J.S., or any other institution which dismisses a
man simply because he has taken a wife, is not
guilty of an act for which the man may recover
damages at law. Regulations and contracts to.
the contrary notwithstanding, every citizen
possesses the common-law right of marriage, and,
if he be over 21 years of age, neither the in-
stitution which pays him wages, nor anybody
else, is privileged to interfere with him, nor
punish him in this respect. So, one of these days,
the A.J.S. Bank may bring its anti-marriage law
into operation regarding a clerk who has a legal:
friend, or some legal knowledge of his own, and
may find itself at the top of King Street, defend-
ing an action for a whole peck of damages. Then
the rule willsuddenly be abolished, and the clerk
With £199 annually, who leads his best girl to the.
altar, will find that his services are dispensed
with merely because he has an intelligible signa-
ture, or his hair is red, or his kow-tow to the-
directors is not sufficiently servile, and that the
bank wouldn’t dream of interfering with his right
to commit matrimony, where, when, or liow he.
feels inclined. The bank would sooner die than,
do anything so illegal.
The Selling of “Spiffs”: Political and.
Otherwise.
Modern Carruthersism is—to borrow one ex-
quisitely draperese term —a “ spiff” line. Joseph
and his mud-bespattered political stock are viewed,
askance throughout the N.S.W. country districts;:
tWo ™* ooen. and mourned.
over from time to time in the metropolis by the
Deform press. The Sydney press, unfortunately,
cannot burn the Carruthers stock, as it might
any other brand of “spiffs.” The dilapidated
goods simply must be passed off on the public.
Their destruction would mean a holocaust of the
entire Deform warehouse, and Deform bank-
ruptcy all round. Wherefore the Ma State is
being offered some truly edifying examples at the
present time of what the typical resourceful
Calico Jim is capable of when he goes in for
polities, and finds himself driven by stress of
circumstances to apply the ethics of the local
import trade to the science of government. For
instance, Carruthers— desperately determined to
vend the mildewing “spiffs”—hints darkly that
he will secede from the Federation. If the
N.S.W. State blighters will only forget his past
for a moment and roll up in their thousands and
patronise him, and overlook the mildew on his
political stock, he will, by way of bonus, so to
speak, do something to bust up the Common-
wealth. If only broken promises, administrative
extravagances, muddled gaming laws. Lands
scandals, and about 97 other items of the kind be
disregarded, he will really do something nasty in
a large way to Australia. And the Sydney
press prepares to support him. After all, wha,t
does a little decay matter in the soft-goods politi-
cal trade?
The Anarchist in the Pot Hat.
One day last week a deputation waited on
N.S.W. Premier Carrutiiers to complain about
Victoria’s recent action in subsidising a line of
steamships to develop a trade with “the East.”
And Carruthers —who hopes to run an election
and get back to office by screaming “State
Rights ” —was appalled at the wickedness of Vic-
toria. “If Victoria wants fight,” he said, “it
shall have it ” ; and this alleged Freetrader, who
is supposed to be against bonuses, subsidies, and
all sorts of “artificial” aids to industry, under-
took that the N.S. Wales merchant should not be
at a disadvantage in the pursuit of the order for
five tons of flour for Java. The Bulletin has a
certain amount of sympathy for the N.S. Wales
merchant in this matter. It is obvious that
if the Victorian State Government subsidises
a shipping line, the Victorian exporter must
be in a better position to get the foreign order
than the N.S. Wales merchant, who has to pay all
the freight himself; and this idea of State bat-
tling against State is repulsive. Yet it isn’t for
Carruthers and his crowd to complain. They
want State Rights. They want more State
Rights. They 1 want less “Federal thraldom.”
And therein they have made the usual small-
minded man’s mistake. They thought that State
Rights meant the right of the State to be cantank-
erous towards, and to belittle, the Commonwealth.
They find, instead, that State Rights mean the
right of each State to fight for its own hand. The
man who doesn’t relish being told to move on by
the policeman may think he is doing a fine
thing for his own dignity and importance by
abolishing the policeman. Presently, however,
he finds that, the policefnah Abolished and
authority cast into the gutter, it is every man
for himself. It is anarchy. And “ State
Rights ” spells anarchy—as Carruthers practi-
cally admits when he says, “If Victoria wants
fight it shall have it.” It is a good thing, then,
that the real meaning of “State Rights” has
come to the surface so soon, and that Hie Aus-
tralian people can see whither the insane cry is
taking them. Now that they can see, they may
also treat as an enemy, alike of Australia and of
good, orderly government, the self-seeking poli-
tician who attempts to extend the influence and
power of the State at the expehse of the Common-
wealth.

Good Times for Rags.
The man who swears by the imported tweed and
“won’t have any of your colonial rubbish,” ought
to get considerable dissatisfaction out of recent
proceedings at Dewsbury—the * place where they
hold the principal English rag sales. “Old lin-
sey blacks,” which used to be knocked down at
2s. 6d. per cwt., now, it seems, command Bs.; and
ancient white flannel—what service it has seen ask
not!—jumped from 355. to 51s. per cwt. in one
week. Old socks and stockings, which are quite
a Dewsbury dainty, have gone from 225. to 375.
fid., and are still moving. Of course this is
mainly due to the rise in wool. Even the manu-
facturer of shoddy must put something into
his abominable stuff ; and, now that he is
less inclined than ever to put in the honest,
new harvest of the sheep, the supplier of
the worn-out dishcloth and the discarded socks
sees his chance and puts up his price. The results
are two or three. In the first place, the shoddy
manufacturer puts up his price also, and the Aus-
tralian importer passes on the extra to his cus-
tomer who “won’t have your colonial rubbish.”
The importer mentions the high price of wool—
“ and a great thing for the country, too,” he adds.
He doesn’t allude to the Dewsbury market for
dirty rags. And for another result the shoddy
manufacturer, disinclined to pay any more for his
rag-rubbish than he used to, accepts a class of rag
at which even he would not look a while ago. As
one Dewsbury market report put it —“Not only
were they paying more money, but the niaterials
were nothing like so good in quality.” So the
.superfine person who tells his Melbourne or
Sydney tailor that he “ won’t have any colonial
rubbish ” can do The Block filled with the proud
thought that He is probably wearing rags that,
two years ago, were beneath even the rag-picker s

sock is a prince, and the superannuated underpants
are an earl at the very least.

London Times puts the case for an Australian
navy from the Imperial standpoint
An oceanic empire cannot be permanently maintained
bv a sea power residing in only one portion of it. Sea power,
with its attributes—knowledge of the sea, power of build-
ing, repairing, and handling ships and their accessories—
must be innate in every portion of it. Australia and
Maori land are islands no less than the United Kingdom.
Canada, South Africa, India—each have vast coastlines,
and "-reat oversea trade. Each and all of them are
capable of becoming the homes of great naval industries.
Even from the narrow' point of view of immediate naval
■strategy there are great advantages in the multiplication
of coaling stations and repairing docks, which are not
merely floated out from England, and involve the mainte-
nance of costly garrisons, but are backed by great in-
dustries, and by a well-armed people. Here again, our
political principle demands that each part of the Empire
should, as far as its economic circumstances allow it,
;share in the industrial advantages incidental to naval
activity. • • • The younger States should be encouraged
to build for themselves the destroyers, scouts, and sub-
marines, and even small cruisers which are to be under
their direct administrative control; and to manufacture
torpedoes, guns, and ammunition, and the Admiralty
should be prepared to purchase these freely if the terms
are reasonable.
Are you attending, Messrs. Kelly, Pilcher, and
other Little Australians ?
«
'The fate of the Land Bill introduced into the
Maoriland Parliament last session hangs at pre-
sent in the balance : _Minigter of Lands Robert
McNab, the author of the measure, has shown
himself a better Democrat than most people ex-
pected. His proposals for limitation of area of
land are an advance upon the system of purchase,
which, indeed, they are largely intended to super-
sede, and it was not to be expected that the big
land-holders would remain idle while the Govern-
ment thus boldly attacked the Sacred Ark of Large
Estates. The Bill cuts two ways. First, it removes
the present need for land purchase on a large
scale by the Government, and thus removes one
large purchaser from the market; and, secondly,
it compels every person having an estate worth
over £50,000 to sell enough land to reduce the
value of his holding to that sum. The tendency
in both cases is to reduce the price of land, and
in this way to afford great relief to the small
settler. The land-owners have spent their spare
time during the last six months in denouncing
McNab as one who wishes to repeal the decalogue
and destroy good old British institutions generally.
McNab, on his side, has not been idle. He has
stumped the country, explaining to the cockies the
advantages of the Bill, and he has met with some
success. As an evidence thereof, two anti-Sosh
gentlemen, who were appointed by the so-called
Farmers’Union to conduct a campaign in favor
of big estates, received a very bad reception from
the cockies of Rangiora, near Christchurch. In
fact, after hearing the two anti-Sosh gentlemen
against the Bill, the meeting voted by a more
than three to one majority that it was a very
good Bill indeed.

A giRL writes this ;
There has been a good deal lately in the paper with the
pink cover anent the slant-eyed Mongolian, but the pity
of it is that it should fall on so many unheeding ears.
How many people care a tinker’s cuss about the destiny
of the Australian race? Hardly one in a thousand. The
man is too busy selling his soul for gold to buy that for
which it lusteth. And the woman —when she thinks of
it—has a queer dependence upon the Providence which
will see to the good of her descendants. To her mind
the other fellow’s Providence is an unknown quantity.
Perhaps in the old days the Jebusites, the Hittites, and
the other “ ites” labored under the same delusion.
Referring to the visit of the little brown man to Mel-
bourne, a friend of mine was enthusing over them one
day. I remarked. “ They have only come to spy out
the land.” “ You’re a real alarmist,” she said. “ And if
you don’t mind my saying so, people will be calling you
a bore.” I persisted, regardless of the danger of that awful
stigma. “ VVhat would you say if they annexed our con-
tinent? If you and your sons became Japanese sub-
jects?” “Well, why not?” she said. “I am sure we
should get on very well with them. They are so polite,
and make such excellent servants.” She hadn’t the
beginning of a comprehension that they might not make
very good masters, and that she might make a very un-
satisfactory servant to a brown employer.
She reminded me, with her utter inability to compre-
hend a possible new order of things, of the case of a
bronzed traveller who had made a wonderful journey
in the African Sahara, and of a society woman to whom
he related some of his experiences. He told her of
howling wastes, of sand-storms, camels, and tents, of
thirst and emptiness, and she listened with a dazed ex-
pression in her eye. “ What I can’t understand,” she ex-
plained afterwards to a friend, “is who keep the hotels
there.” Starting with the assumption that there must
be hotels everywhere, ihe whole story had fallen on stony
ground ; she imagined vaguely that the traveller put up
at the Australia or Menzies every evening, and had vainly
tried to make the camels and the wildernesses fit in.
And my friend, starting with the assumption that the
white man will always be boss even if he is conquered,
and that the Jap will be content to be servile and polite
ip the kitchen, even if he is a conqueror, couldn’t get the
hang of things either. The idea that her fortune and
her relatives might disappear in the war, and her house
be obliterated, arid that she might, when the trouble
was over, be kitchen-wench to a Jap master—that was
quite beyond her range of thought. “ There has always
been a king in France,” said the French aristocrat as he
pooh-poohed the coming Revolution. And my friend
thinks in the same way that there will always be a Jap in
the kitchen and a white woman in the drawing room.
Foil want of a graduated land tax to break up
great empty estates in the fertile and accessible
parts of N.S. W., the Lands Department is driven
to shove the settler into strange remote regions,
where he finds curious company. Just now an
effort is being made to trade off the “Mungle
Scrub,” a patch of waste land 153,000 acres in ex-
tent, 50 miles from Warialda and about 500 from
Sydney. The official report of a Board which
has just inspected Mungle Scrub is not cheerful.
The land is the home of wild dogs, which are the
scourge of the district; is infested with rabbits,
and covered by a thick and useless scrub, with
hardly enough timber to make a decent fence.
Also, some 10,000 acres are an impenetrable thicket
of prickly pear, and the prickly thing is spreading
at an appalling rate throughout the scrub. The
Board offers the land cheap. So the prospect
may be worth something to a hefty youth
who can live on air, and can clear the scrub more
quickly than the prickly pear can spread ; but
even then his neighbors must be equally hefty,
or the dingoes and rabbits, to say nothing
of the pear, won’t be kept at bay. On the
whole, the chances are against success. If the ad-
jacent big estates, where there is good land, were
broken up and closely settled, then Mungle could
be assailed from all round its circumference, like
a besieged city. A dense adjacent population
would make land valuable, and the scrub would
be shot and the pear trapped, and the rabbit ring-
barked, and the dingo cut down and burnt in
furious haste to get at that value. But to battle
with these horrors for a dozen years merely to
have, in the end, a bit of a farm in an unpeopled
wilderness, far from any market, isn’t a cheering
prospect. The shortest way to attack a quarter
million acres of scrub and rabbit is to settle popu-
lation close at hand and create a big town along-
side. There was never a scrub or rabbit or dingo
or cactus invented that could resist that form of
attack.

“F.”: When the Commonwealth finally gets
possession of the Northern Territory, it will have
a problem in the grazing leases. It is easy to say
there is plenty of room in the N.T. for sill who
may come, but the trouble is that these lessees
have naturally picked out the eyes of the country
—not for ever, but for a long while to come. The
area of the N.T. is 523,620 square miles, and of
this over a third is leased, most of it since Feder-
ation. Nine lessees hold 60,000 square miles of
the finest pastoral and arable land, which they
rent at less than one shilling per square mile per
annum ! W. FoiUtEST holds 5300 square miles;
J. Collins, 3943 square miles; the East African
Cold Storage Co., 19,250 square miles; the Roper
R. syndicate, 5000 square miles; Forrest,
Emanuel, and Kidman, 8000 square miles;
Joseph Bradshaw, 6800 square miles; Buchanan,
3000 square miles; Connor, Doherty, and
Durack, 3000 square miles; J. C. White, 5000
square miles. All these leases start between
1901 and 1904, and run for 42 years, at Is. per
square mile per annum. Heaven knows what the
East African Cold Storage Co. does in that galley,
but it holds a slab of country four-fifths the size
of Tasmania, which contains several navigable
rivers, and has harbors and an enormous stretch of
sea frontage. The conditions of lease seem to have
been drawn up by the lessees themselves. The
land cannot be resurjied for closer pastoral settle-
ment within 10 years, except with the consent of
the lessees, and even then two years’ notice must
be given, and compensation paid for loss or depre.
°iation in value of the lease, as well as for im-
provements. If the land be wanted for the
production of “tropical products,” three months’
notice suffices instead of two years’, but compen-
sation must be paid before possession. As to
what that compensation might amount to—
Forrest, Emanuel and Kidman had last year
60,000 horned cattle on their 8000 square miles;
they have since exported 21,000, and still have
75,000. They pay £4OO a year rent—tlie rent of a
Collins-street office. What sort of a figure would
they ask for the loss of an enterprise as profitable
as that? And a third of the Territory—that
nearest the coast and the big rivers—is leased till
1942 !

Sydney Telegraph the other day, aimed a brick
which it thought would hit both the State Labor
party and the Australian Government. Holman,
of the Labor party, had complained that the
Cariiuthers State Government, while it did not
“propose” to take any of the burdens off the
working class, nevertheless was going to take
some off the other class that paid income-tax.
Thereupon the Telegraph
The State Government has no power to take off the
taxes which impose burdens on the workers and the
whole of the community. Those are the Federal taxes,
levied by the party which Mr. Holman’s confreres in the
Federal Parliament keep in power. All the State Govern-
ment can do is to remit its own taxes, and that is what
Mr. Carruthers proposes.
From which it is to be concluded that there is no
State taxation nowadays except the income-tax,
since that is the only tax (apart from a trifle in
the way of the small stamp-tax on receipts) with
which Carruthers proposes to interfere. Vet
the total revenue of the N.S.W. Government last
year was £12,291,367, of which the Federal refunds
amounted to £2,742,770, leaving £9,548,597 raised
by the State Government, partly through taxa-
tion, partly through services rendered ; and, of
that £9,548,597, all that the income-tax was
responsible for was £266,233. Apart from the
income-tax and what the Carruthers Govern-
ment receives from the Commonwealth, the State
thus collects over millions sterling a year from
the people in one way and another ; and if the
great heart of the Telegraph and the great heart
of Carruthers bleed for an over-taxed people,
there is, apart from the income-tax, 9£ millions
sterling of room for them to show their grief and
sympathy in a practical way.

While Thomas the Unwieldy is cavorting about
London, quite a peck of trouble is being saved up
for him in Victoria. Before he went away, his
Ministry decided to raise the valuation of a large
portion of State land still available for selection.
This caused a furious commotion in the country
party; but Thomas, no doubt, thought it would
be all over by the time he got back. Present
appearances, however, indicate that the storm
will not reach its height until Parliament meets.
The Age, which loves a Parliamentary disturb-
ance, is fanning the flames, and declares that
“ when Parliament meets, a corner party will still
be there, more critical and dangerous than its pre-
decessor. ” For months past the Age has been work-
ing up an agitation against the Government’s land
policy, and has been distributing curses with a
free hand. It is becoming apparent that Bent’s
absorption of the Mackinnon-Peacock Opposi-
tion may not turn out half so clever a
move as it appeared to be. Prkndergast and
his party threw their chance away by their atti-
tude towards the Gambling and Licensing Acts.
But there is room for an effective movement from
the Government corner party, assisted, of course,
by the direct Opposition. Bent’s safety will lie
in the fact that most members of the corner
would sooner make a league with the devil than
with Prendergast. Still, they will hold the fear
of such a coalition over Bent’s head, and will use
their position to vote as they please on Govern-‘
ment measures. Altogether, it seems certain
that next session will be a wrangling one, and
probably a stormy one ; while there is a reason-
able possibility of it being a disastrous one for
the Government. So the home-coming of the
Bulky One will not be as cheerful an event as once
seemed likely.
A sidelight on the Asiatic menace and some
other things :
The toe of Asia is beginning to hit against people who
never expected to be kicked like that. The Monkey’s
triumph over the Bear wasn’t anything like it was
represented to be ; but the blind Jingo Britisher didn’t
stop to consider consequences, and he set himself to
magnify the doings of the discolored Asiatic at the
expense of the white European. India, especially the
half-educated, strutting baboo, heard the whoop for the
“superior” Asiatic, and strutted more than ever. So
there began again the Hindoo trouble, and there rose,
more articulately than ever before perhaps, the cry of
“ India for the Indians.” Now, to many Hindoos, India
means Indian commerce ; for they only think in terms of
trade. To control commerce they know they ought to
control the means of communication. The railways—
blocked there ! The European (the poor inferior being
whom the Hindoos’ fellow-Asiatic had just got under his
heel) had control of them. So there remained only the
shipping ; wherefore the Hindoo has been reaching out
after that. But he has done it so characteristically,
getting hold of the meanest, cheapest, dirtiest old
tubs, and running them in the meanest, cheapest,
dirtiest way. Yet, of course, he can offer ridicu-
lously low freights. India’s white representative at the
Shipping Conference was angry with Oom Bill Lyne for
saying that the Lascar worked for 4Jd. per day, and de-
clared that the wage was 9d. ; but on these old tubs 4Jd.
is probably 25 per cent, over the mark. Therefore,
wretched as the competition is, the great 8.1.5. N. Co.
soon began to suffer ; and especially where native trade
had to be catered for, it has had to cut rates down to the
bone. Without backing, the Hindoo opposition soon
broke down : the 8.1.5. N. Co., at any rate, did the white
the good service of correcting the growing native notion
that the European is now the Asiatic’s meat any time
the Asiatic pleases. But the Hindoo is not finished with
yet. He has bought more ships—rather better ships this
time: old P. and O. boats and such like ; and soon the
8.1.5. N. Co. is to be challenged again. How it will end
is just as uncertain as how everything will end in India ;
but by this time more than one English shipowner is
wondering whether it wouldn’t have paid him better if
he hadn’t manned his boats with Lascars all these years,
and thus turned their thoughts towards sea-trade.

The stock condemnations at Glebe Island (Syd-
ney) abattoirs show a percentage serious enough
to cause alarm. Granted that inspection there
blocks all tuberculous animals from going into
consumption as meat, what about the danger to
the public through the disease being spread by
way of the milk-can? If so substantial a pro-
portion of stock offered for slaughtering is
tainted, the chances are that a substantial pro-
portion of milking cows is tainted too. In that
case, what inspection is there to protect the pub-
lic ? The municipal authorities are supposed to
control this matter, but nine-tenths of them
regard it as of no consequence whatever. They
don’t know anything about cows, and they don’t
want to. The awful incapacity of the average
municipal person to take any interest worth
mentioning in anything except the footpath in
front of Blogg’s, the grocer’s, is one of the dis-
eases of the day. In bis small way he sees that
the state of the footpath has a direct bearing on
the value of Propputy, and that explains every-
thing. And it is doubtful whether any real im-
provement will happen until Propputy has ho
say in the election of the municipal person.

This season of grand opera in Sydney has
had to fight against most dismal weather condi-
tions and a somewhat erratic lot of singers,
causing frequent changes of the announced
programme. “The Flying Dutchman,” for
example, has justified his spooky reputation on
the Sydney boards by vanishing unaccountably
at the last moment. On three separate occasions
he has been announced, and the stage hands have
prepared the thunder and the lightning ; and the
swish of the wild sea waves has been laid on ; and
Nature has come to the aid of Art with torrential
fugues of rain on the theatre roof ; and each time
no Dutchman ; and in each case it was the failure
of the lady cast for Senta. Finally, in despair,
another lady was put into training—a more re-
liable runner—and on last Tuesday night, just
when The Bulletin was going to press, com-
pelled thereto by the exigencies of the too-vast orb
of its circulation, the Dutchman was definitely
announced to materialise.

Saturday night last, when the mariner of
the curse inflicted one of his disappointments, the
audience was compensated with by far the best
production of “Lohengrin”yetachievedinSydney.
Studemund was in excellent voice, and sang in
places like an angel—a grossly over-fed angel.
Miss Mia Barckow, with hardly enough strength
in her voice for the part of Elsa, yet sang and
acted with such charm and sweetness as to win
favor all round. Miss Johanna Heinze was an
effective dramatic Ortrude, and Mohwinkel, Rupp
and Riinger were all at their best. It was a fine
artistic performance all round, even to the chorus
of Kings and Electors and the like, who formed the
mob in the streets. In those German days the
mob was almost exclusively made up of Kings,
Grand Electors, Palatines and such.

For the current week “ The Flying Dutch-
man” will alternate with “Faust.” “ The Val-
kyrie ” is set down for Tuesday , July 2nd.

If “The Spring Chicken” were a duck-
ling it would suit the weather better, and the
change would probably be an improvement—
honestly, it could hardly be anything else. Still,
Sydney must have its Lauri and its comic-opera
fooling at this time of the year ; so the Chicken
can’t complain of want of attention, for even in
its fourth week Her Majesty’s is, most nights,
not too big for the crowd.

No copyright performance of any comic
opera was ever tried on a bigger dog than was
Dr. MacCarthy’s “ Lady Nora.” Her Majesty’s
was packed at the matinee experimental on
Saturday. Two guineas was the admission fee !
Yet the audience was all invited —to a guest.
The doctor’s music is fine, but there is enough of
it for two operas, and a cantata, too. Where the
whole thing fails is in the libretto. The plot is
melodramatic. There is a mortgage (ha-ha !), a
scheming money-lender (ha-ha-ha 1), stolen bank-
notes (ha-ha-ha-ha), and other melodramatic pro-
perties (ha). There is a quantity of weak remarks
about the hollowness of society— most of which
have been made before. The music is dainty,
and tuneful, and the composer has done his work
well—rather too well for present-day comic opera.
Mrs. Truman, Josie Miles, Emily Marks, Ada
Harpham, W. Burns-Walker, Sidney Price,
Arthur Noble, and others did justice to the items.
The readers, headed by Edmund Duggan, and
seated in a half-circle, simply spoke the libretto,
without action. J. S. Gresty’s orchestration and
his conducting of the opera were fine.

Why one melodrama should “go” like a
corps of victorious cavalry pursuing a vanquished
enemy, and why the other melodrama should fall
as flat as the vanquished foe under the hoofs of
the cavalry, is as inscrutable as the ways of Provi-
dence or Solomon’s ship upon the sea. No doubt
the Charles Holloway Co. is wondering yet why
“The Coal King” didn’t take Sydney by the
ears, eyes, and pockets. If ever this writer
saw what ought to have been a theatre-
packing drama, it was “The Coal King.”
It was thrill from start to near the
finish, when there was peace with a pro-
mise of retribution. But “The Coal King”
faded away after a week, and managers
don’t take off a play for love of change. Then
“ The Colleen Bawn ” fell off the Irish rock. So
last Saturday “Two Little Vagabonds” gam-
bolled and “corfed” upon the Palace boards.
Quite early “ the house full ” notice was hoisted.
The piece has been played so often by the C. H.
Co. that all Sydney knows the story. Also it knows
how well Miss Holloway and Miss Mabel Russell
play the pair of pathetic vagabond children, Dick
and Wally. Mr. P. O’Neil was the humorous,
bad man, The Gaffer; but, as Mr. Bruce Smith
might say, “differentiation would be injurious.”
All the co. plays well. Its season closes next
Saturday night.

Granville has brought his grease-paints
over from Melbourne to Sydney Tivoli, and,
having put them on in view of the audience, pro-
ceeds to be Svengali, Nero, and other unpopular
characters ; and the best that can be said of the
“ turn ” is that the Tivoli audience wants more
and more of it—which shows how bad a judge of
melodrama a house that is a pretty good judge of
ordinary music-hall stuff can be. At present the
“ first-part ” setting is in process of transmogri-
fication; next week “The Bathers” will break
upon the view of a shivering city. Curiously, by
the way, the more it rains, and the muckier it be-
comes underfoot, the tighter people squeeze into
the Tivoli. Weather that empties another house
fills the one where Rickards reigns. The reason
why is an esoteric mystery, and is hereby handed
over to the young men’s debating societies, as one
more subject to worry during these long winter
evenings.

“ The Squatter’s Daughter ” continues to
hold the boards at Sydney Criterion. Ben Hall,
that sturdy old-time individualist, rages nightly
with his colleagues what time the State’s wool-
clip is augumented, N.S.W. timber is hewn, and
locally-made powder freely burnt.

At the Lyceum, the enterprising West has
got films of the Thaw trial, the biggest criminal
tussleof the century. To be sure, the century is still
in long clothes, so to speak. The great-brained
counsel, Jerome and Delmas, look a lovely pair of
“toughs.” They, with the baby-faced Mrs.
Thaw, and the defunct gentleman who made pies
of uncooked girl, and the rest of the dramatic
persons over whom the trail of the serpent is
well defined, may be seen nightly at Lyceum
Flicker.

“ Tryphena ” writes from London :
I talked with Carrie Moore between tuneful acts of
“Tom Jones” at the Apollo t’other night. Carrie isn’t
thinner, or fatter, or slower, or faster. She’s Carrie as we
knew her of yore, plus a summer or two. If there’s any
difference at all in the London Carrie, it shows in the top
register, which is softer, rounder, smoother. But all the
talk of her Mayfair airs, and her frill, and her coroneted
followers, is fictional. Carrie’s pure Australia, with the
same lively spirits, cheeky air, exuberant devil-may-care
stage manner. True, when she has to play the abashed
mouse, she manages it with all the devil shut clean off,
and an angel droop of the eyelid. But that is part of
her talent.
Carrie says the stage of the Big Smoke is a cruel and
harsh master—exacting, restless, rigorous ; the competi-
tion is awful. One never ceases to he striving for an
effect, a trick, a blandishment, a coquetry, a something
that the rival stars haven’t practised. Or another cat
has exploited a fresh brand of wink, or a new twirl of her
little toe, or a novel flourish of a hanky, say, and others
must copy it or improve upon it without an evening’s
loss of time. It’s continual effort, constant striving, end-
less toil. No star achieves her high fee or earns her |duke
without herculean effort. All the same, the Courtneidge
star has a suite at the Russell, where it costs half-a-
crown to sneeze. Also Carrie had her Mammy home for
a trip last year.
Two of the most tricky shows in all the Big Smoke are
staged by George Edwardes. At the Gaiety, the belted
earl prospecting on the boards for a beauty to show off
the family diamonds, gathers in force. He’s ogling from
the stalls, he’s braying from every box —and the Gaiety
girl plays up to him, coyly, daintily, with mouse-tread,
and drooping eye, and an unceasing pearl-smile. For
the Gaiety girl has the most perfect teeth in all
the land. Her smile is a dental ad. —or like unto
one. The Gaiety teeth lure Lord Algy on to matri-
mony. If the Gaiety girl sings a risky song (and
she does frequently), the wickedness is subtle, sly,
wrapped up in a demure smile. You see Lord Algy haw-
hawing, and you guess the mouse on the boards has been
saying or singing something naughty. Gertie Millar, for
whom barons have shot themselves and a regiment of
peers quarrelled, is a slim blonde with a small face, of
which all the features seem whimsically crushed together.
She has small trim limbs, and can twirl a toe with prac-
tised grace. After that, nothing but tricks. Her voice
has small range and not much quality, but it’s sugary, and
London likes sugar. At the finish of a lilt, Gertie Millar
curls her note prettily. It’s a mere trick, but it tickles
the ear and pleases Lord Algy, who crows or biays rap-
turously.
In the “Aladdin” chorus I noticed Gladys Saqui,
(sister of the lamented Maie, whose death from lung
trouble was a blow to a big cheery set over here). Gladys
is now plump and charmingly fetching.

At the second Edwardes show, “ The Lady Dandies,”
you see Mayfair’s swaggah femininity and rather less of
the ducal he. The orchestra is the noblest part of the
gay and frolicsome show. But one star shines with great
effect—Evie Green. She, like Carrie Moore at the Court-
neidge show, has exuberance in strong contrast to the
swarm of frilly mice that softly tread the boards on all
sides. Evie Green’s exuberance has lasted (thanks to her
Celtic blood) through many footlight seasons, for the star
is not in her salad days. Her physique is something
finer and grander than Florrie Young’s. She has a
cavalier’s carriage (like Florrie), but with a commanding
mien and a talent for acting that are rare even at the best
of these theatres.
There is starring here in a less degree artistically, but
bigger ducally, Gabrielle Ray—a tiny scrap of a dasher—
the size of a postage-stamp She has mincing baby ways,
a soft bleat, a frightened, silly* air, and extreme porcelain
prettiness. You could box her silly ears and pet her like
a toy poodle. Gabrielle is the sort of girl the belted earl
is looking for. And one of him will wed her sure, in a
season or two. If he doesn’t, some bloated Honorable
will. Gabrielle’s type caters for the lords of creation, and
the Hoggenheimers come nowhere.

“ Star ” : The Melbourne papers have all
praised the interior of the revised Bijou, most of
them with enthusiasm ; but I submit that the
auditorium of the little house is now almost
everything that a theatre auditorium ought not
to be. The first aim of designer and decorator in
handling a theatre interior should be to sub-
ordinate scheme, color, and material to the
requirements of the stage. There should be
nothing in the decoration of the theatre itself that
will tend to kill stage effects. This is a wise rule,
and an artistic propriety that seems to have been
overlooked in preparing an effective inside scheme
for the Bijou. Had the decorators set themselves
to work with the idea of completely out-dazzling
the stage, they could hardly have done better,
short of converting the auditorium into a moving
kaleidoscope. The bright color of the textile
materials employed, the whole plan of the paint-
ing, and the mad idea of lining the sweep of the
circle with mirrors, have produced a result
absolutely destructive to stage illusions. The
interior is very small, and in the half lights
often necessary, it blazes with greater glory
than the stage itself, on top of which it
seems to be piled. At any rate, this is how
the work impresses patrons of the dress-circle.
Possibly the mirrors are mainly responsible
for the defect. Mirrors should be used very
sparingly either on the stage or in the audi-
torium, and in the latter color must be judici-
ously suppressed, the decorator relying mainly
on subdued tones, impressive in the full glow of
the illumination, but lost when lights are down
and the stage demands all attention.

The success of “The Blue Moon,” intro-
ducing the new Williamson Musical Comedy Go. at
Melb. Princess’s last Saturday, is wholly due to the
teachings of the past. Nowise original, “The
Blue Moon ” shows critical acumen in its imitations
of previous comedies that dealt with the egregious
Englishman and the gorgeous East of theatrical
fancy. The white linen-suited officahs appear
again for the severalth time; likewise the
visiting Erelish ladies who tilt their chins
and twirl their parasols in effective contrast
with the natives of the country—lndia or
thereabouts. Also the same old references to dear
old England in general, and London in particu-
lar, are freely repeated. They are indeed re-
peated ad nauseam. Ideas for the narrative and
spectacular arrangements have been borrowed
from “The Cingalee,” “Bose of Persia,” “The
Geisha,” and any other ornate modern extrava-
ganza of British lazy life amidst a gaily-colored
people. The low comedian is a designing mounte-
bank, whilst the nominal heroine has a long-
lost identity, as in “Florodora.” Nothing
is quite fresh, nor irritatingly stale. The
manufacturers of “The Blue Moon”—librettists,
composers, and extra song-writers amount to
five in all—seem to have gathered bits of
material from the beaten track of musical
comedy as they worked along ; but having com-
pleted a first act of reminiscences, the plot-makers
conceived something of a surprise for the public.
Instead of branching off into the way of music-
hall varieties, they carried the story right along
to a comparatively neat conclusion. Experience
had proved the world to be aweary of the comedy
that falls to pieces after 9.30 p.m., so this one was
held together in its second act. The audience on
Saturday was rather disappointed at the outset,
and considerably pleased towards the finish—a
reversal of the usual order of things.
* * * ft
. An air of novelty is given to * ■ The Blue
Moon” by the appearance of new people. A good
many of the players are said to be new to Australia,
and as immigrants they come under the heading of
“desirable.” Myles Clifton, the Majah of the
piece, is a disciple of G. P. Huntley, and a clever
mimic of his master. Reginald Kenneth, the bari-
tone lover, has a voice like unto that of Brownlow
up to a certain point, and his acting is quietly
effective. His ballad of Burmah, supported by a
picturesque girl chorus, is a first-prize item.
Victor Gour.et plays a mobk-Indian juggler, the
most important part in the proceedings. His
personality is small and dry—he wants unctuous-
ness—but he is alert, and remarkably nimble.
Miss Daisie Wallace, the soubrette, who frivols
and talks her songs in a Bose Musgrove manner,
is remarkably clever on her feet; also, the dancing
strength of the co. has another brilliant illustra-
tion in an incidental pas de deux by the Evans
Sisters. The less active principals are our re-
turned brother Pat Bathurst (an admirable Indian
Prince); Miss Ghiloni, as an ornate auntie of noble
British birth; Miss Maud Thorne, who sings
occasionally; and Miss Amy Murphy in the name
part. Miss Murphy is a cultivated singer, with a
pretty rather than enchanting soprano voice. As
an actress she does no better than an ordinary
amateur. Apart from the principals, there is a
lot of good stuff in the show. The chorus is strong
in its leading girls, and the stage management
shows some bright variations of the old musical
comedy business. No production of the kind has
been more handsomely or artistically staged. The
spectacle is always beautiful, the music melodious,
and the work of the orchestra on Saturday was
quite praiseworthy except when Conductor
Moulton dragged the performance by supplying
unnecessary encores.

Three melodramas are breathing their last
in Melbourne, and three others are making ready
to replace them. At Her Majesty’s the last week
of “The Squaw Man” co, will be devoted to
“The Christian,” which should be glad tidings
for those good citizens who found comfort in
“ Parsifal,” and are anxious to be shocked once
more at the kiss-me-John allurements of Glory
Quayle. In Parsifal they saw the sort of
young man that John Storm tries to be—
but isn’t. And in “ The Christian ” they
are taught that the wages of kissing is death, as
regards any earnest pietist. It brings no evil con-
sequences to Glory, the Eternal Woman, but it
has fatal consequences for poor John. That is to
say, John gets hit on the head with a brick ere he
has ceased to blush for his amorous indiscretion,
and the next time Glory kisses him he gives up
the ghost. "The Christian” will be followed by
“Tom Moore,” with Andrew Mack and his
reconstructed co.

The clean and festive looking Bijou has
been so poorly attended since the re-opening that
some of its plush-covered seats are still waiting to
receive a first impression. Nobody has dropped
in upon them thus far. Therefore a change of
bill is appointed for Saturday next (29th), and the
title of this forlorn hope is “ The Little Mother.”
If the city wants any more blood-and-infant drama
of “The Fatal Wedding ” order, business at the
Bijou will improve rapidly; but, judging from
recent indications, the winter is not the season
for that class of goods.

Bland Holt is about to revive “ The
Breaking of the Drought” at the Boyal. A
somewhat long time has elapsed since the
Drought had a breakage in Melbourne, and
just now the glare of a relentless sun on a parched
land will be a welcome stage illusion. Bland
promises A Great Bush Fire as a special attrac-
tion. The manager who can waft an odor of burn-
ing wood across the footlights during the coldest
weeks in the year is a person to be encouraged.

A pair of eccentric jugglers, also a boy
soprano, are the latest arrivals at the Opera
House, and the boy serves as an antidote to the
coon songstress, whose voice is louder than a
dynamite explosion. Otherwise the programme
remains as before; but the Rickards advertise-
ment directs attention to the fact that the
Svengalis will be leaving shortly.
The one purely musical item for next
week is a pianoforte recital by Miss Jessie
Masson, at Glen’s Concert Hall, on Monday, July
Ist. The winsome pianiste is a pupil of that fully
Australianised Teuton, Mr. Edward Scharf, who
will assist the lady in a Schumann concerto by
playing the orchestral accompaniment on a second
piano.
THE METHODIST FACE.
Miss Tifctell Brune has given “absolutely
the last matinee in Australia,” and farewelled
herself away from Adelaide with the sentimental
and ever-popular ‘‘ Sunday.” The whole season
has been one long boom, and now “Mother
Goose ” is an even bigger. Adelaide has to wait
till midwinter for its pantomime, but makes up for
lost time on getting it. Florence Young and Olive
Morrell are not in it—Mabelle Morgan is principal
boy—but Phydora and Shine are on hand, and
the amazing animals, and the wonderful ballets,
and the unexpected swing; and all is joy.
Some hairy agricultural persons of Way-
Back possess Chinese confidence in the purchase-
ableness of high officials. A District Court Judge
lately found a ton of potatoes delivered at his
city residence, and a week later a ham, and had
not ceased marvelling at the substantial recogni-
tion of his great abilities, as the donor phrased it,
when he encountered the donor as plaintiff in a
case before the Court. The Judge had sent the
gifts to a Home. The verdict in the case was in
favor of the agriculturist, and with a knowing
wink that son of the soil now intimates that he
knows his way about the law maze better than
most. For a bigger case he will likely add butter,
eggs and cheeses to weight the “ recognition.”
Thus a writer in a recent number of
Pearson’s Magazine
The caricaturing of one’s Sovereign seems to be quite
an accepted thing abroad, but it is not so in England, at
least it has not been for two generations of reigning
monarchs. ... As Prince of Wales his Majesty was now
and again pictured a bit humorously, but so splendidly
kingly in every sense of the word has been his rule since
the first day of his ascending the throne that the most
iconoclastic of British caricaturists would not dream of
picturing their Sovereign other than as a dignified English
gentleman.
That is a prize chunk of blither. Even if the
average caricaturist wished to exaggerate the
features of Ned VII. he would not be allowed to
do so, for the simple reason that so many editors
and proprietors of British journals are persistent
smoogers for titles. The English caricaturist is
given a free hand with regard to other monarchs
(in this very Pearson’s article specimens are
reprinted in which Alfonso of Spain and others
strongly resemble Lombroso’s champion degene-
rates) ; but if the features of Britain’s “fountain
of honor ” are not flattered into Ohristmas-card
prettiness, editor Smijthkyn-Johnes begins to
tremble for his anticipated knighthood, and
proprietor Sir Albert Froth wildly wants to
know what the black-and-whitist means by doing
him out of his chance of becoming Baron Squash.
That's the sort of regard they have for Edward’s
“ kingly ” qualities.

A CUEE FOE ASTHMA.
A Noted Physician will Prove this to all
Sufferers.
It is but natural that the majority of sufferers
from Asthma, after trying doctors and numberless
remedies without avail, have come to the con-
clusion that there is no cure for this most dis-
tressing disease. These same persons may still
have doubt when they learn through the columns
of the press that Dr. Rudolph Schiffmann, the
recognised authority who has treated more cases
of asthma than any living doctor, has at last
achieved success. He has perfected a remedy
which not only gives immediate relief in the worst
cases, but has positively cured thousands of
sufferers who were considered incurable. These
persons had previously been just as sceptical as
some of our readers now are. Dr Schiffmann’s
remedy doubtless possesses the merit which is
claimed for it, or he would not extend an invita-
tion to every sufferer to make a free personal test
of it. He authorises this paper to announce that
he is not only willing to give free to any
person suffering from asthma or bronchitis in
Australasia one free, liberal “trial package” of
his cure, but urgently requests all sufferers to
send him their names, to whom a sample will be
posted absolutely free of charge. He fears that in
making the claim he does for his Cure, a strong
doubt may arise in the minds of many, and knows
that a personal test, as he offers to all, will be more
convincing and prove its merits, than thousands of
testimonials which he could publish from persons
who have been permanently cured by the use of
his remedy. “Dr. Schiffmann’s Asthma Cure, ’’
as it is called, has been sold by most chemists for
several years, although many persons may never
have heard of it, and it is with a view to reaching
these that he makes this offer. This is certainly
a most generous and fair offer, and all who are
suffering from any of the above complaints should
send to Dr. R. Schiffmann’s Depot, Nos. 5 and 7
Barrack-street, Sydney, He requests that you
send him simply your name and address plainly
on a post-card, nothing else.*


AT POVERTY POINT.
“ N.L.”: The indispensable colored love-maker in the
latest imported musical comedy, “The Blue Moon,” is a
Burmese. Up to date the white musical-comedy girl has
been the stage beloved of persons of about 45 distinct
shades of skin-tint. I understand that the Australian
consuls for the Terra del Fuegans are plaintively asking
when their savage constituents are to get a show. Also
the Hairy Ainu is growing restive.
Santley has lived 52 years since he was assured that he
was in a galloping consumption. That attack is about
the champion slow sprinter on record.
Pollard, with his new Lilliputian Opera Company, has
landed in the breezy South of Maoriland. His “ leading
lady ” is 12-year-old Oily Moore, Carrie’s jolly and minia-
ture sister. It shows wise forethought that she is thus
early “ only twelve.”
THE CRIME-PANIC IN MELBOURNE .
Business transactions up-to-date under Melbourne
conditions.
Oarew, the young actor who married Ellen Terry, who
owned to 59 years before the registrar, told the New
York Times this : “Miss Terry, with her wonderful soul
and artistic temperament, will never grow old. She is
my senior by a good many years, but there are no years
to a woman like Miss Terry, who has all the beauties and
graces of a girl.” May be good enough in theory, but the
man who substitutes wonderful soul and artistic tempera-
ment for the curves of youth is liable to get weary in time.
“ Arsemo ” : “ The Sketch ” of 30/l/’O7 gives two whole
pages to photographs of an actress learning ju-jitsu from a
Japanese “professor ”of that art. In two of the pictures
the grips or holds consist of the Jap putting his arms
round her neck and waist respectively; in another, he
holds her round the neck, and both his feet are off the
ground, the weight of his body being supported by her.
Another depicts a leg-lock. Yet another picture
shows the dear, harmless little fellow with his
squat, deformed-looking body twined right round
the waist of this beautiful white woman. Thought
I’d get the opinions of some Australian girls on the sub-
ject. Much to my surprise and disgust, many of them
said in effect, “ Oh, there’s nothing wrong in that—with
a Jap.” I confess I can’t follow the line of thought which
leads our girls to look upon the Jap as a kind of harmless
small boy. Can it be his size ?
Mabelle Morgan’s comparative success (as a panto, boy,
not a bankrupt witness) is another argument in favor of
the Australian girl. She has had only a short, vocal
training, from clever Mrs. Carew, of Richmond, but she
makes a very tolerable showing on it, and puts uo a very
fair performance to her teacher’s credit and her own. It’s
interesting to recall the fewness of the Australian girls
who have got their “ chance ’’—that indispensable test of
talent so often refused them—and note the unanimity of
their success. Hilda Spong, the Loel sisters, Alice
Orawford, Carrie Moore, the Castles, Celia Ghiloni, Aggie
Thorn and May Beatty, are a minimum list of the women’s
names that occur to one. We want educating up to an
appreciation of our home-grown students and teachers.
This is how a Gippsland editor puts it : “Our readers
will be delighted to hear that B ’s dramatic company
will appear at the Mechanics’ Hall for one night only.”
Writes a Soulful Musical Person : —“ They were seated
right in front of me—he and she—his arm stretched along
the ledge of her seat until his hand succeeded in clutching
her neck, which was hidden by a wrap, on account of the
arctic temperature prevailing in Melbourne Town Hall.
They were both busy with a box of sweets, audibly and
visibly masticating its contents, and finally they listened
to Marie’s Hall’s playing, thus exercising the senses of
touch, taste, hearing and sight simultaneously. Both
were hard at work applauding the conclusion of each item,
and, besides, they occasionally tried to express their
approval in places which in their opinion should have been
the end of an opus. During a pianoforte encore I heard
the following: ‘How pretty! What is it, dear?’ ‘I
don’t know, darling; it is probably a polonaise, or a
mayonnaise, or something.’ ‘ Yes, dear, I thought it was
that.’_ This reminded me of an episode at one of the
Carreno recitals. That wonderful artiste had given
Chopin’s ‘ Butterfly ’ etude as an encore, and, in response
to a boisterous and selfish demand for more, she graciously
returned and repeated the study, playing it, if possible,
still more exquisitely. Never will I forget the tone of
disgust and disappointment in the voice of < ne of my
she-neighbors, who remarked to her companion : ‘ Why,
she is doin’it all over again.’ All! and it doesn’t take
two minutes to play.”
About the most elastic term in the language of the
rural Anti-Socialist of Victoria is “ Mechanics Institute.”
In the elasticity line it even beats “ insulting behavior,”
and “ the sanctity of the ’ome.” Whenever the Vic. Anti-
Socialists want to bleed Tommy Bent (Anti-Sosh) for yet
more State aid they clamor for a subsidy for a “ Mechanics
Institute,” the institution that is used for nigger-
eninstrel shows, and small and early hops, or which is the
rendezvous for the local aristocracy, and pretty well all
the other useless things conceivable. The mechanic
hardly knows the misnamed place by sight.
The east end of Bourke-street, Melbourne, is rendered
hideous these days by the wheeze of the tin voice. All
the phonograph and graphophone and gramophone and
other talking machine in the city seem to have migrated
to that top block. At intervals of about 10 minutes all
day and all night they let their menageries loose, and the
street gets so full of stray metallic voices, shrieking
■comic songs, scraps of grand opera, and marches by
Sousa that it is all one can do to elbow his way through
them. They float about everywhere, and the worst of it
*ll is that you can’t locate the point of origin. They
seem to start from nowhere, and all get tangled up into
one wheeze of mad will-o’-the-wispish voice somewhere
over the tramline. In front of each shop (it is impossible
to count how many shbps there are) stands a little
awe-stricken crowd, varying from 50 on a week day or
night to 200 or 300 on Saturday evenings. These gape
open-mouthed at the shop windows and drink in the
riot of scratchy music. They spend the night roving
frorii -one emporium of shriek to the other, listening in-
tently to see if they can pick out the words of the comic
song or the funny story. It is a poor, miserable craze,
less manly even than the porter-gaff disease.
“ Sr.” : They practise for the Victorian A.N.A. competi-
tions in a place next to the office wherein I slave. The
other afternoon the winner of three first prizes was
giving slops to “The Lost Child.” “Do not take her
from me again ! Do not take her 1 Oh ! you would
not break a mother’s heart?” —this, and a lot
more, in a falsetto shriek. “He doeo i not heed
me ” —in a dismal howl. “ Oh, God ! will no man aid
me? Oh, God! will no one hear me? Oh, God! why
this punishment?” I can’t remember what comes after
that, but at the end of the second last verse it goes:
“ Then she cried from her heart, Help ! Help ! Oh !
Yelp ! ” A few minutes later the young chap who has just
moved into Bahn’s old office came in, looking pale and
worried. He said, “ You’ll 'scuse me, but is that an
elocution class, next door?” I said it was. The young
man in Bahn’s old office looked still more flurried. “ I’ve
made a fool of myself,” he said. “ I heard a most
awful yell in that office, and thinking it was something
crook, I rushed in. A nice-looking girl was standing in
front of an ugly-looking old man, and calling for help.
I jobbed the old man in my excitement, and then they said
they were only rehearsing for some dashed A.N.A. foolish-
ness, and the girl that was calling for help has gone out
to get steak for the old fellow’s eye. You’re sure it’s
only an elocution class?” And again I said it was. But
I told the young man to bear up, for he had done a
noble deed.
“ Num ” : Why doesn’t some wise legislature make it
mandatory for vocalists to repeat 40 words
• of English to a Customs officer before being-
permitted to push noises through their
mouths at the public? During the past
week the writer has listened to over a
dozen public singers in Sydney halls and
theatres, and not one, man or woman, was
able to correctly pronounce ten consecutive
words. Each had some individual idiosyn-
crasy in respect to different vowels. Every
one broke down on “ love,” which he either
called “ loaf,” or pronounced so as to rhyme
with “ rove.” The little conjunction “ and ”
was another word that tangled them up ; in
every instance it was given forth as “ahnd.”
Is there any particular reason why singers
should adopt a dialect different from that of
everybody else, and different from that which
they use themselves inordinary conversation?
The parson who talks with a steeple in his
voice has the same complaint, and has it even
worse than the singer.
Artistic item from London Era : “ Mr. Billy
Williams’s amusing song, his own composition,
entitled, ‘John, Go and Put Your Trousers On!’ has
been added to Messrs. Francis and Day’s ‘Sixpenny
Pops.’”
Florence Ballara, n6e Towl, whose contralto was made
in Germany, hasfareweiled in her native city of Ballarat,
where Towl paterfamilias is an old-established chemist.
The lady leaves shortly for England to begin again the
weary struggle for recognition, which isn’t worth so very
much when you get it.
“Squaw Man ” Waldron can’t understand why Austra-
lians encourage nerves with excessive tea-drinking. His
weakness is coffee, and before his marriage he carried his
coffee-pot with him, and the beans, and a little mill to
grind them with. The hotel was permitted to supply the
cream and loaf-sugar, but Mr. Waldron made his own
breakfast coffee, and shared it pleasantly with any of the
press boys who dropped in to ask why American drama
was always so infernally sudden and scrappy. And the
man who gives up tea for coffee for his nerves’ sake is
like the drunkard who “ reforms” from whisky to gin.
Dr. Sylvester’s son, to whom the old “ Fakir of Oolu ”
passed on his bag of tricks, died in the Adelaide Hospital
the other day. “ Young ” Sylvester was never the show-
man that his father was, and he drifted out of the pro-
fessional trickster’s life some years ago.
“Hamer”: The pathetic lack of originality that is a
feature of a great part of “ the profession ” displays
itself in the rush of small shows pegging out claims
in Sydney. And Sydney isn’t a goldfield for the
Thespian, by any means. Some time ago somebody saw
an opening in Sydney for a small show, and filled it. Any
part of the opening that he didn’t fill was soon filled by
others, and now, when there isn’t any opening left, a
host of “ Poverty-Pointers ” are seeing the vacancy that
disappeared in the dim long ago. Pitt-street is now an
arcade of cheap entertainments.
When, during the London music-hall rumpus, the
managers gave particulars of the salaries paid to some of
the “ stars ” on strike, the English Inland Kevenue De-
partment quietly noted the figures, and when the strike
was ended, applied to the strikers for payment of in-
come-tax. One fairy, who had never paid the tax, was
invited to forward £7OO, while a male comedian, who had
greatly understated his salary, had.to part with £2lO.
As compared with the once-popular comedies and
comedy-dramas of H. J. Byron and his contemporaries,
later comedy works are admirable indeed. But the best
of them seem to have been influenced by the growing
popularity of society journalism—the petty chronicles of
“ smart ” life, which, in their early stage of develop-
ment, were bitingly satirised by Thackeray in his sketchy
writings what time he was using similar material as
padding for his long novels. Talented dramatists have
turned out play after play in always the same setting—
the Smart setting. Comedies of polished-flippant
manners, and pleasure-seeking, leisured-class morality.
In these you get the true atmosphere of the story, if it be
capably acted, but it is an atmosphere of the moment
only, which vanishes with the generation of actors who
produce it. Moreover it is foreign to the majority of
hard-working men and their womenkind. The mind's of
the million cannot breathe freely in it. Such plays have
no chance to please all people when first produced. After
a few years, when the manners and cynicisms of them
have passed out of vogue, they interest nobody. They
hold the mirror up to the Nature that society journalism
treats of, the Nature which has no enduring surface, and,
as they lack the decorative effect of old-time costume
plays, they are doomed to an early death. They are fine
works of dramatic art, some of them, yet they cannot
possibly become classics. They are too deeply tinged
with the sentiment of the ephemeral society nevvspaper.
The noise made by the gramophone is not considered
music by the Law in Queensland. An Ayr publican was
prosecuted for allowing a gramophone to grind out tunes
on his premises without a permit; but the Bench decided
that the “talking machine” wasn’t a musical instru-
ment within the meaning of the Act, and dismissed the
case. Probably the Bench had read “The Jungle,”and
concluded that American tinned goods weren’t often
what they claimed to be.
“ G.E.” (Chicago) : At the theatres here one might
imagine oneself at His Majesty’s or the Princess, unless
the play be “Arizona ” or “ The Virginian,” for the stag's
language is strictly Saxon-English “ as she is Spoke ” in
London. The stage also has its Australian tjuota. At the
Colonial Theatre Beautiful, in Rawdolph-street, in April,
Miss Jennie Opie, of Adelaide, played the important part
of Lady Chaldicott, the mother of the “Belle” in the
comic opera, “ Belle of Ma3'fair,” music by Leslie Stuart.
It is a tuneful play, and Miss Opie shone. Her deep
tones were a pleasing contrast to the high, staccato,
slightly nasal New York voices, and she looked her im-
posing voice. The name of another on the cast, Madge
Melbourne, looks as if the owner might be Australian
also. At the Grand Opera House the preceding week, in
“ The Belle of London Town,” a musical comedy with a
strong resemblance to “School for Scandal,” George
Majeroni made much of one of the principal parts, as a
chivalrous Captain of Dragoons. Australian players in
America well bold their own with the natives, and are
valued muchly on account of their good, easy delivery of
the English language, and sound acting.
The High Court last week dismissed the claim of Miss
Elizabeth Pinn in the awful matter of “The Fatal Wed-
ding.” Miss Pinn sought to restrain Meynell and Gunn
from further staging the melodrama aforesaid, on the
ground that it is a piracy of a story which she wrote eight
years ago, and which was submitted in manuscript to
two firms of London publishers. The sweet womanly
casualness of Miss Pinn’s charge of dishonesty against
some person or persons at one or other of the publishing
offices was not more obvious than her innocence of the
history of the melodrama. “The Fatal Wedding” is a
notoriously old American horror, and, according to Mey-
nell’s affidavit, it was actually produced in Brisbane
sixteen years ago. Let it be remembered, to the honor
of a former generation, that “The Fatal Wedding” was
not an enormous success sixteen years ago.
Touching the mysteries of “ thought-reading ” per-
formances, a young woman witness in a Melbourne
criminal court case stated, the other day, that she was
one of three magicians who astonished the suburban
public. Her little sister sits blindfolded in the ring
whilst she (the w T ‘ ness) and her father go around among
the crowd and ton' h things. And when they say “ What
is this?” or words to that effect, the wonderful Little
Sister with the hanky over her eyes gives the correct
answer—“by something of a pre-arrangement.” The
correctness of the answer is achieved by a carefully-
ordered procedure in touching things. Firstly an
umbrella, then a feathered hat or a bald head, and so on.
Little Sister having got a long list of “touches ” by rote,
gives the right answer every time. Marvellous ! Every
member of the audience is presumably touched for a
silver coin before going in.
A forthcoming Melbourne landmark will be Wirths’
Circus-building, erected on the site of the galvanised iron
structure set up by the Fitzgeralds in their palmy days.
The land thereabouts was a sordid wilderness when the
Fitz. Bros, cleared away the rubbish heaps and built a
permanent place of shelter for their visiting shows. It
was not a beautiful place, but Melbourne accepted it
gratefully as an improvement on the state of desolation
which had previously existed sou’-west of Princes Bridge.
The building was recently sold for the worth of its
material, and the land whereon it stood was granted
under a new lease to Fitgeralds’ old rivals in business—
the Wirth Bros. George Wirth has now arranged for new
buildings, to be completed, if possible, in September. In
the first place the ground level is being raised. An
entrance hall to the circus and menagerie will have a
circular tower and a balcony 80ft. high, where the band
will scatter brazen music to the four winds of Melbourne,
Behind the entrance hall will be a menagerie building
furnished with shrubs and tropical vegetation by way of
persuading the Australian-born tiger that he is dwelling
in the jungle of his ancestors ; also stables for the accom-
modation of 50 geegees, who will no longer suffer the
indignity of being housed with beasts of prey. The circus,
or amphitheatre, will be 180 ft. x 130 ft., with a seating
capacity for 4000 admirers of the great national animal.
There will be room for a raised platform, or theatre stage,
in addition to a circus ring and a chariot racing course.
The scale of magnificence contemplated in the New
Hippodrome brings tears to the eyes of George Wirth
when he speaks about it.
The Empire Pictures 00., on Monday next, opens at
Sydney Palace with some fine scenery pictures.
“ THE LONE HAND” SALE.

“Blister”: Bland Holt, who knows his public, suc-
ceeded at the Theatre Royal, Melbourne, from the over-
ture, but one of his predecessors, Parker Hall, is alleged to
have dropped £2OOO there in two years while educating
the public taste up to tearful melodrama. Parker Hall is
now touring the Victorian provinces with a pathetic com-
pany, whose visible backbone is Mabel Hardinge, a
capable actress —her Oamille is not so much of a failure
as Tittell Brune’s Juliet.
“E.” : I have been much struck by the
fact that bush life does not create friendships
to anything like the same extent as town life-
speaking comparatively, of course. It seems
reasonable to expect that the people of the bush
would be friendly towards each other—that their
semi-isolation would draw into kindly relation-
ship those few families in a position to exchange
neighborly courtesies.
But my experience
teaches me that the
contrary effect is veiy
often produced, and
bush neighbors are
more frequently at
bitter enmity than
neighbors in town.
In fact, if families in
the crowded suburbs
hated each other as
enthusiastically as
neighbors in the bush
do, and fought to-
gether on such small
provocation, town life
would be a pande-
monium. I am fa-
miliar with half-a-
dozen bush districts
where the settlers
give a casual visitor
the impression of
hating each other like
poison, and despite
the enthusiasm of
bush bards, and the
high appreciation of
Bill and Jim in back-
block literature, I
have found more envy, malice, uncharitable-
ness, back-biting and petty meanness in scat-
tered scrub communities than is discoverable
in the city. Given two families of settlers,
separated by half-a-mile of bush, and it is two to
one they are either open foes who batter each
other on sight, or they cherish a smouldering
antipathy that leads them into moody recitals of
each other’s vices, meannesses, and crime records,
to the illimitable weariness of the stranger within
their gates.
BALLADE OF THE MIME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
'Throughout these later days of prose
The stage has held the world in thrall,
The Critic’s breeze unheeded blows ;
Each Sock and Buskin carnival
Evokes laudation liberal
For every clown in every clime ;
And good or bad, or great or small,
Behold a monarch in the Mime.
When on the Block, at sundry shows,
Heads lower at his beck and call;
No beams like wrinkled Borneo’s,
And round his laurelled pedestal
Luxuriously ladies crawl
To hail his Godhead all sublime.
He is Creation’s principal,—
Behold a monarch in the Mime.
Though stranded, old, he never knows
His glory is unvirginal,
For he retains his limelit pose
(Though hash-housekeepers barge and squall)
When at his foot lay Fashion’s ball —
Those splendors of his golden prime ;
No mummer lacketh Memory’s haul, —
Behold a monarch in the Mime.
ENVOI.
Dull clods are they, Dames of the stall,
Who build or paint, orate or rhyme,
Unlike this ornate animal, —
Behold a monarch in the Mime.

Baby.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BABY ! Your baby ! The bijou edition
of yourselves but not the sixpenny
edition. It will cost a lot more than
sixpence before you have done with it—and be
well worth it. It would be reasonably cheap at
eighteenpence to you, with your wonderful
parental love —most wonderful of loves —the love
for a muling, puking baby.
Now that you have caught the little brute, and
your first curiosity is over, don’t destroy it. If it
be well-fed and groomed, it Will grow and alter,
and, therefore, improve. It can’t get worse.
Optimism is always justified in new parents.
It will develop sense and detect differences
between you and other people—and prefer you.
This will please and flatter you. It cannot
speak. If it could, it would say, “Better the
devil I know than the one I don’t know.”
Now is the time to try weird experiments in its
management. If you lose it now there will be
the loss of less invested capital than would be the
case later on. With anything like dog’s treat-
ment, however, you won’t lose it. It wants to
stay. It has no better billet offered it, and it
reckons it is doing the cute thing by sponging on
you. It saves seven bob a week while it lives at
your expense. And these are days of severe com-
petition.
Make it earn its keep.
Waken it out of its sleep to smile for your
visitors.
Whether you neglect it some, or lavish every
care upon it, it will soon begin to walk. Don’t
be frightened. This proceeding is not miracu-
lous. It is just a way they have, in common with
other animals. Most other animals have the
advantage of a tail to balance with, but, apart
from that, they are about equal. In teaching
it to walk in the straight and narrow way,
slippers are a valuable aid. If it shows any
pendency to walk in the slippery way of
sinners, a stick will help it to remain upright.
If you are lucky you have acquired a silent
baby, but the chances are all against it. It is
almost certain to begin to talk. Don’t destroy it
on this account. It will be little worse than a
parrot. It will begin with easy words of one
syllable, that mean anything. As it grows older,
its words will be more exclusive. It will talk
rapidly, but a stenographer is not necessary. Let
its sayings run to waste. It is only practising on
you. “ Playing its damn scales,” as it would say.
When it talks and walks, baby has gone, and you
have a boy or girl. Baby has become a memory
or a dream.

It is typical of Melbourne Argus to
employ as “expert” doubt-raiser regarding the
Australian Navy an ancient who retired from the
British naval service 38 years ago. John C. R.

trailing initials into daring statements like this:—
My own fear is that time will show that the results of

Dear Bulletin, —Father wants you to let the
public know that he has persuaded the boss to put a
Spray on the market that is within the reach of every
householder. These small machines, holding' about one
gallon, will he sold at twenty-one shillings each. With
one the suburban resident can keep the pests off the
flowers and fruit trees, whitewash the fowl-yards, kalso*
mine the rooms, disinfect the premises, kill all the cock-
roaches or white ants, or any other vermin that may be
strolling round. Father reckons that everyone will have
one of these machines. It is better than putting money
into a Life Insurance Co. The man who keeps down the
deadly microbe keeps his household in health ; by keep-
ing his fowl-yard free from vermin he provides plenty of
eggs for the table ; by keeping the trees clean the kids
are enabled to get some fruit. The new machines will
be ready the first week in July, either at the Head Office 1
314 George-street, Sydney, or at the Agencies— Block
Place, Melbourne; 26 Adelaide-street, Brisbane ; and
Waymouth-street, Adelaide. Yours faithfully, Bill
Williams.*

Some parsons’ capacity for settling matters
with their consciences amounts to genius. Lately
one of them had business at a shipping office; a
party was going back to “the work” in the
South Seas. There was a child among them..
The shipping clerk turned up the regulations, and
found that only infants under six could travel
free. “ You’d better say she’s under six,” the book-
ing-clerk suggested. “ I can’t say anything that’s
not correct,” said a reproachful voice from within
the collar. “Then you’d better not say any-
thing.” So he didn’t say anything, and he went
off apparently happy and satisfied. You see, he
had kept his mouth from lying and his tongue
from evil-speaking. Also he had kept his money
in his pocket. As Parkes said, when Dr. Angel
Money’s name was mentioned, that was making
the best of both worlds.
Now is the time to buy Chamberlain’s
Cough Remedy. It is the best medicine for
croup.*
“ Kati-Kati ” : Be closer settlement. Land
will be closely settled : the only question is by
what and by whom ? By white men with their
wives and families? By Asiatics? By rabbits,
brambles, burr, or what ? Land cannot be held
idle. It will either grow grass and crops or
weeds, cactus, and bunnies. Satan will always
find some mischief still for idle lands to do.

A Sydney Christian dame, of the advertis-
ing charitable type, sent, the other day, to (say)
Mrs. Hopeless a parcel containing a few cast-off
garments—which her “slushy” had enthusias-
tically rejected as being unfit to work in. The
precious bundle was erroneously delivered to
another unfortunate of the same name in the
same street, who was also in the habit of catching
crumbs dropped by the mighty. Learning later
of the mistake, the meek and lowly almsgiver
called personally on Mrs. H. No. 2, and roundly
denounced her as a woman of no piety and less
character. “I always thought she was no good,”
she said later, smugly, to Mrs. H. No.l, “and I am
satisfied now that she is in the habit of receiving
presents from a doubtful source.” And the
clothes were such as Sin wouldn’t wipe its boots on.

The scramble of the clerical crows over the

Sale to proclaim that it was he who turned on the

plish anything but for the work of himself. With
bated breath he whispered that he “went round
Melbourne with his life in his hands.” This fierce
desire to get in a peck at' the Wren tote is
unseemly. The eyes are gone, the kidney fat has
gone, the flesh has mostly gone. A decent crow

The question as to whether the gas sup-
plied to Sydney by the Australian Gas Co. is of a
cheap and especially dangerous sort has not been
satisfactorily settled as yet. But the coroner’s
inquiry into the point has elicited two facts, of
which the general public was unaware —(1) that
the only really poisonous constituent of coal gas
is carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas, and
that the danger of coal-gas poisoning grows with
the proportion of carbon monoxide that it contains;
(2) that in other countries there is special legislation
prohibiting the supply of coal gas containing over
a certain percentage of carbon monoxide, as a gas
co. is often tempted to adopt cheap methods of
manufacture which involve an increase in the
proportion of that poisonous constituent, NeW
South Wales in Certain matters of domestic
legislation is not fat 1 ahead Of Turkey, It has so
got into the habit of discussing at great length

didn’t pay to catch more. These baskets contain
18 barracouta each, and average a return to the
fisherman of Is. per basket. Yet one cannot get
a fair-sized ’couta in Melbourne under 6d., while
the price mostly runs to 9d. or Is. The same con-
ditions rule in Sydney. Fish is dear to the
public, but cheap from the sweated fisherman,
who constantly has to throw away fish in order to
keep up some sort of a price. The middleman
between robs both producer and consumer shame-
lessly.

“ Oxy ” ; In many of the large country
centres in Australia, and in the cities also, are
“maternity ” and “refuge” homes controlled and
ostensibly maintained by the Salvation Army, in
the noble cause of “ the best-natured and best-com-
plexioned thing in the world ” —charity. In these
homes are herded unfortunate women who have
been deceived by men or were injudicious in
their love affairs, and others who have been
“rescued” from the courts or “cap-
tured ” as they emerge from the gates of
the gaol. In every possible instance,
the male responsible, or alleged to
be responsible, for the girl’s mis-
fortune is hunted and badgered for
maintenance and pursued by angry,
avaricious Army officers into the
Children’s Courts. Here, with the
tenacity of a herd of bull-dogs,
these self-sacrificing servants of
the Loard fight hard for “ pre-
liminary expenses,” perman-
ent maintenance, and Costs—
the Costs incurred by these
batteners on imbecility and
credulity in attending at the
court in the interests of the
Army Bank. The mother
is then fed on charity, and
is “permitted” to remain
at the home ; the child is
clothed and fed on the
maintenance money, and
cared for by its anxious
mother when she is not
slaving at the wash-tub in
the interests of Booth. In
the case of the rescued and
captured, the girls are housed
and worked with an eye to
business, but if they prove
intractable and unprofitable,
they are recommended to re-
gistry offices as “ honest, trust-
worthy, clean, tidy, capable
and energetic.” I know two
instances in which a female
cripple, who runs a registry,
found situations for, and advanced
money for fares, etc., to “captures” on the
word of an Army matron. Needless to say,
the incorrigibles misappropriated the advances
and didn’t turn up at the jobs. But what does
the Army care? It hasn’t lost anything, except
something it was glad to get rid of.

A little spiritualistic coterie in Sydney
has been rudely broken up. The leading medium
used to be controlled by a spook of a literary turn
of mind. The spook furnished the medium with
a deal of advance (though never more than three
weeks in advance) magazine information, and the
medium would reel off selections from magazine
articles before the magazines themselves were
available in N.S.W. The circle was spell-
bound, and one clergyman who haunted the
spooky circle (and who later proved the accuracy
of the medium’s quotations by comparing them
with the English monthlies when they came
to hand) referred to the matter as a “ won-
derful and accurate occult demonstration,”
and gave the ghost-raiser a sort of certificate of
spiritual solvency. He now wishes he hadn’t, for
it was just as simple a fraud as the spiritual appa-
rition which consists of a white nightgown hang-
ing in a dim light from a broom-handle. The
spookist had the magazines sent to him by letter
post, consequently they came to hand long before
the bulk parcels that crawled round by sea as
freight. A simple-minded people are those who
sit in dim parlors listening to the assurance of
little Jimmy’s spirit that he is quite happy and
doesn’t mind being dead.

The female who sees an amorous ruffian in
every man carried her fears to extremes in Mel-
bourne lately. She got into a second-class car-
riage of the Northcote train, leaving the door
open. The porter was too busy to shut it, and,
as the train ran through to the city without stop-
ping, a man in the next compartment, fearing
someone might be swept off an intervening plat-
form, leant over the partition and asked the
woman to close the door. As she didn’t take his
advice, he offered to step over and shut it himself,
whereupon the dame—a married woman of serious
age—stepped from the carriage on to the track.
At the first stopping place—Prince’s Bridge—the
man duly reported the occurrence ; and it was
well for him he did so, for the dame was dis-
covered where she had sat down, in a had state of
gravel rash, with a broken rib or two, and a story
of a villain who had threatened to climb over the
partition and dishonor her, whereupon she had pre-
ferred to chance death, and had stepped out. A
detective, who investigated the matter, found
that others had noticed the open door when
leaving the station, but nobody had heard any
screams or uproar ; so after seeing the woman safe
in hospital, lie dropped the matter. Probably
the woman’s fears were genuine enough but woe-
fully mistaken. On some points the average
woman can’t help deceiving herself.
* * * *
The Bulletin’s original advice was :
“Don’t ride in the same compartment with a
lone female.” Its amended advice is: “Don’t
ride in the next compartment to that of a lone
woman.” Later developments will probably show
the inadvisability of riding in the same train with
a lone woman. In fact, all experience teaches us
that the lone woman is the one person who should
never be allowed abroad without a parent or
guardian.

Mr. Michael Mahoney, who has been
Acting-Chief Commissioner of Police in Victoria
while Thomas O’Callaghan recovers from the
effects of his sudden fall from a tram, the other
day issued a decree that henceforth reporters
should be treated as mere human beings—not
allowed to enter police offices, to use police tele
phones, nor to have private yarns with the police.
Painters were called in, and on all the doors of
the police rooms frequented or visited by reporters
were painted flaming notices —“No admittance.
Strictly private. Police only.” That was in the
morning at nine o’clock. At three o’clock on the
afternoon of the same day, Alex. Peacock, Chief
Secretary, the man with the iron laugh, sent
down an urgent message that Mr. Michael
Mahoney should at once remove the embargo on
the press. Whereat Michael, having no iron
laugh to hide his discomfiture, and not being able
to paint out the big notices, assumed the air of a
well-slapped naughty boy, and came to the con-
clusion that three daily papers were of more im-
portance to a politician with an iron laugh than
all the police forces on the face of the earth.
* * * *
Understood that Chief Commissioner
O’Callaghan has received the broadest of invita-
tions to retire from the Vic. Police Force on a
pension. At present he is recovering from the
effects of a fall from the dummy of a tram car..
The accident, by his own official showing, was the
result of a “fit.” In a state of unconsciousness
or faintness, the elderly O’Callaghan fell off.
When a boss policeman, who has passed the re-
tiring age, begins to fall off a tram car, it is time
to lift him carefully out of his office chair.

Mr. F. S. Grim wade writes to the Argus,
suggesting a thorough inquiry into the Victorian
Police Force; “the present state of things is
unendurable and a scandal.” Some folk are only
awaking to that fact now that they feel their own
skulls in jeopardy. As a matter of fact, from its
earliest date the Melbourne Force has been chief-
officered by amateurs. The first Chief, W. H. F.
Mitchell, was the son of a parson, and had been
squatting when Governor Latrobe appointed
him Chief of Police; his assistant was
Charles McMahon, formerly captain in the
10th Hussars. When Mitchell resigned, in
1856, McMahon succeeded him in the chief
office, and was a ghastly failure. Then
followed another retired military officer, who
had tried digging for gold and failed. He held
on until 1880, when the fearful mess of the Kelly
gang extermination obliged him to retire.
And the men who followed him, if they have had
more experience, do not seem to have had much
better skill.

Maoriland police are taking a long time to
moisten their palms before seizing the Maori
tohunga for whose tombstone a grateful public
would willingly pay. At Atiamu there flourishes
an especially evil sample of the breed. He was
discovered a short time since curing a Maori child
of evil spirits. First, he put the child in a creek
that flowed past his whare for the longer half of a
night. It seems the creek didn’t wash the sin
away, so the old man took her into the whare and
beat her all over with sticks. Every whack was
supposed to knock a devil out. The European
who arrived in time to hit the tohunga a nasty
whack under his sacred ear, found him choking
the child to prevent the devils he had knocked
out of her from re-entering. His treatment was
so successful that the child died next day. There
was neither an inquest on the patient nor on the
tohunga. *
There are many queer ideas of Heaven in
the minds of the holy. A sample, from patriarch
John Watsford’s book of “Glorious Gospel
Triumphs,” describing a visit to Ono, Fiji, when
it was thoroughly converted :
On the Sabbath not a fire was lighted on the island, all
food having been cooked the day before. What a
glorious change from the dark days of heathenism ! It
was like a foretaste of the heavenly Sabbath.
We now know at least this much about Heaven—
that it’s a place where they have cold corned beef
on Sundays, without even a “nice hot cup of
tea ” to help it down.

“Adelaide”: Don’t spurn the rest of a
good story. It is perfectly true, as stated in
B. 13/6/’O7, that “A Young Man Grateful”
wrote to Adelaide Register that, after seeing
“Parsifal,” he cancelled a previous engagement,
of which he now saw the wickedness. But why
omit the fact that another young man immediately
wrote to the same paper to express his gratitude ?
He too had seen ‘ ‘ Parsifal, ” and was *‘ now fonder
of the ladies than ever ! ”

The Board appointed to deal with the can-
cellation of the Willis shilling-an-acre leases has,
in every case so far, reserved its decision after
hearing evidence. The position in many of the
cases is difficult. In one particular case, wherein
the Board was bombarded with proof that people
were clamoring for the land to be thrown open for
settlement, it was shown that the lessee had spent
£lOOO in making the country suitable for occupa-
tion, and another case was heard in which the
mortgagees had spent £5500 in improvements. If
the State is to compensate in such instances, it is
obvious that there will be a huge bill to foot.

Sydney Telegraph last week :
Mr. Justice G. B. Simpson, the Divorce Court Judge,
has on many occasions spoken of his dislike of the law in
regard to the restriction of conjugal rights.
Of course it was only a printer’s blunder for
“restitution” —occurring in a newspaper which
somehow or other manages to be the worst
“read” of any big daily on earth —but report
says it made Mr. Simpson a very wild Justice
indeed.

The “British New Guinea” stamp is now
surcharged “Papua”—thefirst outward and visible
sign that Australia has taken over the Posses-
sion. The change of name is a sensible one.
“ Papua ” is short, significant, appropriate.
“ British New Guinea,” suggesting that the place
was British (which it was in no real sense), new
(which it wasn’t), and Guinea (which is a place in
Africa), was altogether silly.

BATTISTA THE WAITER: “ Hi, belowa there, Antonio! Cursa you—malediciones—send up a

N.S.W.’s revised railway fares will jump
firmly with both feet on the ticket “scalping”
industry. Under the present system of single
fare and a half for the return journey, the margin
for successful “ scalping” operations is large, and
widely availed of. Commissioner Oliver, some
years back, reckoned the annual loss therefrom as
£20,000. A single second-class to Bourke,
f’rinstance, is 565. 6d. ; return, 84s. 9d.—2Bs. 3d.
below cost of two single fares, and a difference
which allows both seller and buyer 10s. off their
single fares, and gives their intermediary, the
“ scalper,” a profit of nearly a like amount. The
new reductions are on more scientific lines (single
second-class to Bourke, 405.; return, 725.), and,
while substantially reducing both single and
return fares, make the cost of the single and
double journey more equitable, and leave an un-
workable margin for the “ scalper.”
Reference was made in a recent Bul-
letin to the love of the Asiatic for decom-
posed food. Unfortunately, too, he has a way
of imparting his smellful practices to Euro-
peans who live alongside him. Throughout
India, it is the custom among white and
black alike to serve a fish, which died
somewhere in the stone age, to every-
body who has curry. This aged em-
blem, known as a “ Bombay duck,” is,
at its best, the westerly breeze from
Glebe Island and the whole atmos-
phere of industrial Footscray com-
pressed into a few inches. But the
old Anglo-Indian devours his pto-
maines like a ravening tiger, and
calls for a second helping. Thus it
has grown to be quite the thing in
naice circles to worry decayed fish,
and even in Australian swell re-
staurants to-day it is difficult to get
curry without the waiter bringing in a
stick of bacteria that makes the welkin
ring. The Chinese practice of eating stale
eggs also catches on with the degenerate
European who has lived any time in Chow-
land. One of Sydney’s best-known theatrical
press-agents always makes his boarding-house
keeper provide him with eggs that have been
ripened for some months in the cellar, and even
these he complains about as being too fresh.
It is his proudest boast that in Shanghai
he once took part in a dinner, the prin-
cipal item of which was uncooked
pigeon’s eggs, 120 years old. When
a son and heir is born to the aris-
tocratic Chow, he lays down a few
dozen eggs to be distributed among
the infant’s great-grandchildren a
couple of centuries hence.
Even the brine-hardened fisherman has a
sentimental side to his nature. On the beach
near Frankston (Vic.) is a small grave. This
the local toilers of the deep regard as their special
property, and they take pride in keeping it in
order. When the oldest inhabitant was quite a
youth, the body of a young boy, with long, fair
hair, was washed ashore there one day. It was
never claimed or identified, so the fishermen
buried the dead child on the beach, and erected a
rough, granite headstone to his memory. Ever
since, their descendants have kept the place
green and trim. It all smacks more of some
Heine idyll than of the stark, mullet-stained men
who go down to the Bay in lfi-footers from Frank-
ston Beach.
A cablegram:—
The Commission of Health for New York State reports
that of 154 samples of Chicago canned meats sold under
the national pure food law, 13 contained a boron pre-
servative, and many contained bristles, hair, and pieces
of skin.
It is hard to teach an old dog to keep out of the

Ada Ward has attained to the dignity of
being quoted in S.A. Criminal Court by defen-
dant’s counsel in an “obscene libel” case. Her
suggestions as to the life of girls on the stage, he
said, did far more to deprave young men and
excite their passions than his client’s writings !

A recent writer on India (I. Malcolm)
discussed with a “ veteran statesman ” of a native
State the proposal to send out a Royal Dook as
Viceroy. “No good,” said the man of experi-
ence. “ Our high respect to a King is not to his
person, but to his power.” Whence it appears,
remembering its excitement over theYorklet, and
our yearnings for the Connaught, that Australian
officialdom can give the fawning Asiatic a start of
71 kowtows in the Great Grovel competition, and
flop home an easy winner.

No wonder the sweater thrives ! A Col-
lingwood employer, who is a local councillor and
a member of the Wages Board in his trade, was
lately charged with paying three of his hands
less than the minimum wage. Not only had he
thus robbed his workmen ; he showed also his
opinion of anti-sweating legislation by sacking all
three as soon as be was found out. But he was a
representative citizen and a councillor, and the
Mayor and a brother Bumble were on the Bench ;
so the fines were 2s. 6d. in each case. Until
there is a means of prosecuting magistrates in
such cases for contempt of justice, social legisla-
tion is not of much use.
* * * •
Adelaide Register tells approvingly the
tale of Ah Looey, “lowly market gardener” of
Nhill, just over the Victorian border. All the
savings of this Australian citizen “have been
sent to China to help educate his son, who is now
a professor in a Chinese university.” Now he has
“ entertained the townspeople at a banquet,” and
as he is going home to the wife he has managed to
do without for 20 years, “ 250 ladies assembled at
the Mechanics’ Hall to make a presentation of a
gold locket and chain, and bid him farewell.”
“ Looey then shook hands with the ladies, and
called them ‘ lallikins.’ ” Faugh !
It sounds like a preposterous realisation of
an old vaudeville joke to hear that the Welling-
ton Judge has bound over the man who bit off his
sweetheart’s nose, to keep the peace for six
months. The girl is going to marry the man
She’ll wed the snapping man, we vow.
The Lord knows why.
What conies of that old proverb now :
“ Once bit, twice shy ”?

The moving-on process between the States
is in full force. Last week, one Price was charged,
at the Adelaide Police Court, with being “a
person found guilty of felony, and imprisoned
for a period of one year and upwards, in W.A.,
which sentence had not expired for a greater
period than three years.” Accused very naturally
said he was not aware such a law existed. The
police in Perth had given him “ a chance to clear
out,” and he had taken it. He would really like
to get back to his native N.S.W. He was
remanded for four days, and given a strong hint
to clear out again meanwhile, so by this time he
is probably back in Sydney.

Adelaide Advertiser publishes from “ a
distinguished Adelaide University man,” now
resident in ’Frisco, some facts as to the Jap in
America:—
Suppose I meet here a “ little brown man ” on the street
or on a narrow pathway, does he ever under any circum-
stances step aside ? No, I have to stand by and let him
pass always, and not only have t to do so, but! have, time
and time again, seen a woman have to step off a narrow
board footway into the mud to let'a Japanese pass, with
his well-satisfied smirk on his face. Then,‘on the trams,
it is a common trick for a Japanese to get on a tram and
ride as far as he can till the conductor comes round, and
then pretend he doesn’t know any English and doesn’t
understand what is wanted, and then, if the bluff suc-
ceeds and the conductor turns away, he settles back in
his seat with a well-satisfied air and a smile that makes
one writhe to see.
The Japanese “ children ” attending the schools in San
Francisco (for whose education California pays) are young
men of 18 to 20 years of ag&> They are usually inferior
scholars, and are in low grades among children of 7 to
12 years old. Cases of violation of girls of this age by
Japanese “ children ” are of almost daily occurrence in
San Francisco. %
There are fewer than 20,000 Japanese in California, yet
I have it from medical inspectors that of the 4000 odd
prostitutes in San Francisco before the fire, over one-
fourth were Japanese.
The Chinese is in some ways preferable to the Japanese,
but he breaks every municipal law with wonderful con-
sistency. He depends upon the weakness or the cor-
ruption (in ’Frisco it was the latter) of the municipality
to enable him to continue such profitable businesses as
opium selling and opium dens, gambling houses, and the
selling of kidnapped white girls (previously drugged with
opium, then ruined and kept till sufficiently demoralised
to be resigned).

The Dr. Arthur idea that Anglo-Indians
with bad or doubtful livers, and a bank account
or pension, might easily be induced to settle down
in Australia is no novelty. Archbishop Murphy,
the nonagenarian of Hobart, was attracted here half
a century ago from India ; Edward Braddon
heard the call of the Tasmanian climate ;
the Chaffevs recruited in India for their Mil-
dura and Renmark irrigation settlements ; and
quite a score of prominent Australian families
owe their origin to men who packed up the bit of
sound liver India left them and settled on Aus-
tralian plains.

THE PRINTER’S ERROR FINES.
NOTE.— The Lone Hand for July had gone to
press before the May Printer’s Errors letters could
be fully examined. The result accordingly is now
announced here.
The first fine for the most complete list of errors
(£10) goes to
Eric Faris, Bella Vista, Auckland, N.Z.
In addition, fines of £1 each are payable for the
discovery of errors not in the first list to
F. V. Ramsden, Alexandra-street, Balaclava,
Victoria.
H. D. Hill, Ada-street, Waratah, N.S.W.
Arthur H. Farmer, Lower Bago, Batlow,
N.S.W.
John Moves, Wellington-road, North Norwood,
Adelaide, S.A.
Further, one contestant who claimed for 122
errors (most of the claims were absurd) would be
entitled to £1 for finding a new error if he had
enclosed his coupon. But he did not do so, and
we cannot tell even his name and address. On
this occasion a point will ’ be stretched, and £1
paid, if this competitor will send name and
address and some means of identifying his list.
It begins “ page 1, col. 2, line 1, ‘-To’ is omitted,”
and ends “ page 99, col. 1, line 7.” ‘But, in future,
the rule that the coupon, with full name and
address, must accompany the list of errors, will
be strictly enforced.

“ Boronia” : I have just read (B. 18/4/’O7)
the wail of a family of S.A. farmers (re the land
in W.A.). It wailed to this effect
There is only the poorest land now to be obtained in
W.A. There’ are good patches, but they have been
swallowed up long ago. It would take 20 acres in some
parts to keep a sheep. You would have to go 40 miles
from a market for land of anything like quality.
Now, if that is the best reason that family of
farmers has for complaining of W.A., it is a very
poor one. The first two ' statements are quite
correct, but then it is about the same all over.
Hasn’t all the good land near a market or railway
in the other States been, swajlowed up long ago ?
Did these farmers expect ,the land up against a,
mirket to wait for them to happen along ? And
what arrant fools the old hands would have been
had they removed themselves : to the “land of
anything like quality,” 40 miles away, and left the
handy dust for the late-comers. They bewail the
fact that in some parts, ft would take 20 acres' to
carry a sheep. What about it? There are
hundreds of acres in South Aus. that wouldn't
keep half a sheep, let alone one jumbuok.

in a back number of The Bulletin in which a
correspondent devotes a few lines to the eating of
lizards by his cat, which, he says, grew very thin
as a result. Have known cats to partake of grass-
hoppers and cockroaches, and there is undoubtedly
a property in both these insects that is destructive
to adipose tissue. When that last plague of
grasshoppers was on, my cats dined sumptuously
on them, and became as poor as Job’s turkey.
Chinamen dry cockroaches and grind them to
powder, and use same as antifat. What quality
' there is in them I do not know, but would like to;
also, the reason why cats eat them and the
’hoppers ?
“ Edyson ” : The trouble in the bar arose
out of an amiable conversation. Maginnis having
made reference to Bill Squires, Hogan remem-
bered what a fine, strapping lad he was himself
at 28. Then Maginnis recollected that at that
age there wasn’t a man in the whole countryside
who was his equal at efforts of endurance and
feats of strength. “I mind the time,” said
Hogan, “whin I cud carry two bags iv shpuds,
’n’ niver turn a hair o’me.” “’Twas at Halli-
gan’s far-rm on th’ Crowbar,” said Maginnis re-
flectively, as if taxing his memory, “ I carried
three bags iv shpuds up a hill fer
a bet iv five pounds.” Hogan
gasped. “Be gor, thim was shmall
spuds,” he said. “ They was
nothin’ iv th’ sort,” retorted
Maginnis; “they was thut size,
iv’ry wan iv them.” “ ’Tis a
lie!” said Hogan. “’N’ who’re
you callin’ a liar?” asked Magin-
nis bitterly. “A mane bit iv a
waster iv a man what cudn’t carry
a gallon iv beer widout shpillin’
it, talkin’ iv liftin’ two bags iv
shpuds?” “ I’ll lift’em this min-
ute, ’n’ you on top,” said Hogan,
hotly. “You’ll not, Hogan. Yer
a liar, me man.” “Liar yerself !
Th’ man what’s got beat wid his
wife re’glar iv’ry Sathurday iv his
life, moight at laste kape a civil
tongue in his head.” “I’ll hit
yeh, Hogan—mind now, I will
that.” Maginnis shook his fist very
close to Hogan’s nose. Hogan
did not flinch. “You was niver
th’ man, Spike Maginnis,” he said,
valiantly, “ niver in your bor-rn
days.” “ I’ll land you such a
polthog, Dan. Don't dar’ me.”
“I do dar’ ye, Maginnis. Do ut.
Hit me. You ain’t the man.” “I
will then.” “ ’N’ for whoi don’t
yer do ut? Do it, man, do ut.”
Hogan put his hands under his
coat-tail, and thrust his face de-
fiantly into that of Maginnis. “If
I do, Dan—if I hit you on’y wanst,
ye’ll niver forget ut.” “Be me sowl, if you
raised a hand t’ me, Maginnis, I’d make yer
wife a widdv. You hit me! Be Hivin, I’d give
yell a shillin’ t’ do ut. Batin’ you, Spike, would
be on’y fun t’ me. I’d like it better’ll drinkin’
beer.” “Don’t yeh defy me, Hogan. I’ll hit
yeh, I will.” “Then hit me —hit me—hit me ! ”
Hogan followed Maginnis up, a step at a time,
thrusting his head forward like an emu. Maginnis
drew off and hit him fair between the eyes,
knocking him sprawling on the sloppy sawdust,
where he remained for a moment. Then he arose
and steadied himself, holding to the bar counter.
“There,” said Hogan, “ I knew yeh wasn’t game
t’ hit me har-rd !”

“ Salmo ” : Re “Mangrove’s” par. (B.
30/5/ 07) as to the use of glass for spear-heads in
the Kimberley district. The common white soda-
water bottle is the favorite material, and then
only the thicker part of the glass towards the
base of the bottle. The green glass is evidently
considered not suitable; in fact, I remember seeing
only one spear-head of that material. “Kim-
berley” Forrest, eldest son of the late Alec
Forrest, and nephew of Bigjolm, had one of the
finest collections of these spear-heads procurable.
Also the glass is not broken into shape, but is
worn down by continual friction with a particular
kind of stone, probably a hard sandstone, and
anyone who has ever tried to shape glass by this
method will have some idea of the amount of
patience required. A still greater difficulty is
the fastening of the head to the spear, and this
also shows great ingenuity and resource.

“ F.R.” : I want to put in a plea with
bushmen for the lovely wiiite goshawk. With
most bushmen all hawks, from the magnificent
weuge-taileci eagle (aquila
aitdax) generally called the
eaglehawk, down to the
tiny sparrow-hawk, are
classed as vermin, and
are shot whenever op-
portunity offers.
Most varieties of
the eagle and hawk
are numerous
enough to require
no special protec-
tion, hut the white
goshawk is an ex-
ception. It is no-
where (so far as I
am aware) numer-
ous ; and in most
places it is steadily
getting scarcer.
Yet it is a magni-
ficent bird, and
there is nothing
like it anywhere
else in the world.
Its plumage is a
dazzling snow-
white, and its legs
are a bright yel-
low. On the wing
its long, pointed
pinions enable it to
fly with great speed
and grace. I saw a pair flying in the air a
few days ago, and I never saw a finer aerial dis-
play. The goshawk does not do much damage,
and, as I have said, there are very few of him
anyway. By the way, surely it is time to drop
calling our tine eagle the eaglehawk. He is a
larger bird than the famous golden and bald
eagles of Europe. No doubt the old crazy im-
ported notion that anything “at ’Ome ’’ is better
than is to be found in “ the colonies,” is respon-
sible for the silly name.

Tweed Heads (N.S.W.) as the most variously
named place in Australia (B. 23/5/’O7), 1 enter a

situated on the Great Northern railway line. It

“ Revolo ” : “ J.G.” (B. 23/5/’O7) is wrong
when he says that no crop can be harvested
where stinkwort has spread over paddocks.
Stinkwort is a summer growth, and when ploughed
down in winter at sowing time it disappears,
and paddocks that have been literally covered
with the pest before the wheat was sown
don’t show a wort to the square mile at harvest
time. So, as far as wheat-growing is concerned, it
makes no difference. Stock will eat stinkwort,
and live on it too, where nothing else is to be
had.
RESPECTING THE CLOTH.

“Phil.”: About small dwellings (vide the
Narrabri Shearer case). I. enter a hovel in a
Riverina “township ” for the prize. This edifice
consists of one room, about 14 x 12. with a
“verandah.” enclosed on two sides, which does
duty as kitchen, laundry, harness-room, etc. The
main room is parlor, dining room, storeroom, and
general living-room, as well as bedroom for seven
people. Am strongly of opinion, however, that
the house is only the visible sign of a subterranean
dwelling, built on the principles of rabbit archi-
tecture. 1 cannot see the sleeping accommoda-
tion otherwise, and there is no loft.

“ J.Gr.” : Re length of time bullocks can
live without water (B. _6/6/’O7). I was
working on a farm during the hay hai-
vest, and we cut a big paddock of hay
with a mower and stacked it up loose.
The stack was a big one when completed,
and held about 200 tons of stuff. One
night soon after it was built, a gale came
along and the stack toppled over. As the
weather was fine, the boss didn’t bother
to have it rebuilt, but left it lying there
for a few weeks until the grain harvest
was over. Then he decided to cut the
whole stack into chaff. A steam cutter
was hauled alongside the stack, and five
or six men got to work. Mick and I were
toiling as little as we could on top of the
stack. One day Mick disappeared from
view with an unearthly yell. Then there
was a convulsion under me, and I also
toppled over and fell down about lift.,
right on top of Mick. When we pulled
ourselves together we found that we were
in the company of a big, wild-eyed and
long-horned bullock. The stack had
fallen right on top of an old fence, and
he bullock must have been lying or stand-
ing against the fence, and thus got im-
prisoned in the ruins. He had eaten out
a few tons of stuff, and was living in a
room about 12ft. square and lift, high
when we discovered him. But during
all that time he had done without water.
As soon as we had liberated him he
made a bee line fora swamp about half a
mile away, and kept in it for the rest of the day.

“B. N. Perkins”: Be “Janor”(B. 6/6/’O7)
on the alleged refusal of the jackass to tackle live
snakes. Recently I was up in Gippsland, and
saw a black snake caught and thrown alive to the
garden jackass. That bird didn't avoid the snake
as “Beelzebub avoids holy water” (perhaps
Beelzebub drinks holy water). Jack caught it by
the head, and in about 30 seconds the snake had
disappeared. Saw the same jackass offered three
live frogs, which he put away in good time.
When offered a fourth he jibbed a bit, but
eventually he got it down after a struggle. The
bird didn’t seem to be pleased with itself after
this, and having flapped its wings about, thought
it would sit down and consider. All of a sudden
out came the final frog, very much alive and
kicking; something like Jonah and the whale.
As “ Janor” seems so positive about the jackass
not tackling live snakes, perhaps the one I saw
was a freak. Or perhaps what “Janor” really
meant was that the jackass doesn’t eat boa-
constrictors.
“ Hod-Carrier ” —his tale :
Have you ever been to Cookernup? See Cookernup,
and die. “Non eontingit cuique adire ad Cookernup"
(This is Latin, interpolated to show that I am an edu-
cated “ pusson,” like those gentlemen who, in the daily
press,_sign themselves “Pro Bono Publico,” “Fiat Jus-
pitia,” and such like. Well, reoenons d nos moutons (this
is French). I have been to Cookernup, and,haven’t died
yet ; 1 have even attended the annual racemeeting, at
which the prize for the first horse in the principal race
is a bottle of whisky, whilst the owner of the second
horse has to put up with a tin of jam. All the rank and
fashion of the district were there, besides numbers of
hoi polloi (this is Greek). My object in attending was
to run a little Chicago sweep-machine, and incidentally
to rake in a few bob. Everything went all right for a
while, and, as I was satisfied with the modest commission
of a,shilling for each turn of the wheel, my patrons were
numerous.
I felt myself blossoming into a kind of embrvo Car-
negie, when Nemesis came in the shape of a big, half-
drunken blaekfellow, who opened negotiations with me
as to the possibility of floating a loan. When I explained
to him that, owing to the depreciation in silver, it would
be impossible to meet his views, lie became bellicose, and
smashed up my little bread-winner. Now, I considered
that was a bit over the odds, after having indulged in
dreams of wealth, so just as he was turning away I let
him have a swing on the ear-hole, which shook him up
considerably. However, he was plucky, and I could see
knew a bit about the game, for he got to me quick and
lively, and in about two minutes sent me to sleep with a
beauty fair on the point.
The races that day had no further interest for me, and
when I regained consciousness there were but few people
about. I also found that someone had been running the
rule over me, and had taken every bean. I was sitting up,
half-dazed, when a rough-looking customer came up and
said : “Hello, mate, how are you feeling now?” I re-
plied that I did not feel any too good, and he remarked :
“ Well, look here, matey, that black cow that laid you
out is sitting over-on that log half .asleep. Now’s your
time to sock it into him.”
I looked, and sure enough there was a blaekfellow sit-
ting down with his head on his chest and a gin bottle
alongside him. I still felt pretty sick and stupid, but I
got up and walked over to him, and, measuring my dis-
tance, I let him have one to go on with ; but, to my sur-
prise, when he fell off the log I could see he was an old
fellow of about 70. My friend, in the meantime, had
commandeered the gin bottle and gone off. I was just
deliberating what to do when another party came who
must have witnessed the occurrence, and told me that I
ought to be ashamed of myself hitting a poor old man
like that. Well, I did feel a bit ashamed, and I also felt
as if I did not want any more fight that day, but happen-
ing to look up I saw that my new acquaintance had only
one arm. So l turned to him and said, “If you ain’t
d—- —d civil I’ll serve you the same.” My oath, I’m game
as they make ’em. In fact, I’m a fair “ boshter ” (and
that’s Australian).
“ Backwash ” : Re the crocodile discussion
re-opened by “Benbee” recently. There are
apparently more varieties of ’dile than are com-
monly supposed to exist. The Johnstone River
croc, is the harmless beggar with the long snout,
which, I think, never exceeds 12ft., but the
estuarian, or man-eater, is something different
and unusual. I recently saw one trapped on the
banks of the Norman, and was told in all serious-
ness, by a nigger of the district, that this par-
ticular’dile was an emissary of the Koko-vvidee
tribe, whose haunt is on the south bank of the
Mitchell. He declared that when the said ’dile
was shot, a buck of the above tribe would die.
Being questioned further on the subject, he gave
me this for his gospel : Certain crocodiles are part
and parcel of the being of certain bucks. These
particular saurians s-iil the bounding river in
sc:uc!i of men of foreign tribes. When succes ful

in their search they carry their prey alive to their
other selves. On the journey the victim’s head is
kept above water, with the result that when
the destination is reached the poor beggar has
been robbed of his wool by birds. However, he
is dumped on the bank of the river, and the ’dile’s
mate is signalled that supper time is at hand. On
the arrival of the human half of the combine, the
crocogator draws off into the river, and the victim
is marched by the human half up to the tribal
headquarters. Here, after a great corroboree,
the newcomer is presented by the chief with a
dull thud on the back of the neck. My informant
would not say that the other niggers ate then-
black brother, but he entered into details of the
difference between the allodile which is half a
blackfellow, and the crocogator which is not. Of
the latter, he declared, he and his friends had no
fear. From what I could gather, the difference
lay in the large front teeth, and the bloated
portion in the neck.
GOIN’ ON SHIFT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Just the twinkle of a lantern gleamin’ on the track,
With slantin’ rays a-shinin’ on the mud,
Then yer see a billy swingin’ ever fro and back,
An’ hear a blucher’s swish an’ heavy thud ;
A Agger loomin’ darkly ; a good old pipe aglow ;
A scent o’ maybe “ Derby ” swiftly whiffed ;
Then yer pass the feller greetin’—’is name ? How do
I know ?
’E’s just agood old miner “ goin’ on shift.”
’E’s makin’ for the poppet-’eads—makin’ for the shaft.
’ls crib is in ’is pocket, tucked in square ;
An’ ’e’s got ’is work afore ’irn, a night o’ sweat an’ graft,
Ere ’e sees the mornin’ sun a-risin’ fair ;
An’ whether ’e’s on contract, or on eight bob a day,
At the rock-drill, on the cross-cut, stope or drift,
'E’ll have worked ! is best an’ honest afore ’e draws ’is pay,
Will that self-same good old miner “goin’ on shift.”
Yer can see the mine-lights shinin’ just across the dip,
An’ the braceman standin’ ready at ’is post.
Kind o’ startlin’ from the engine-house above yon mullock
tip,
Conies the siren’s warnin’ —“ No time to be lost.”
Can yer hear the knocker ringin’, and that other janglin’
sound?
It’s the stoppin’ at the surface of the lift—
It has brought a batch of miners up from underground,
An’ is waitin’ for the night ones “ goin’ on shift.”
An’ it ain’t all joy, yer thinkin’ ? Well, I reckon you are
right,
When freezin’ squalls an’ sleet sweep o’er the plain,
To cross ’is shanty threshold, and step into the night
To meet the cuttin’ blast and sting-in’ rain ;
An’ p’raps ’e’s tired an’ out o’ sorts—a trifle lonely—when
A friendly star gleams brightly through a rift,
An’ it lights ’is track to duty quite pleasantly, and then
’E’s cheery, is that miner “ goin’ on shift.”

“Dishtwister ” : Went through a perish
-coming off a bender ; found myself 50 miles from
-civilisation, and knocked up. Water nowhere,
food unavailable. Threw away some cun cart-
ridges, being useless lumber. Went to sleep under
a mulga, and dreamt my chance of throwing a
seven was sweet. Suddenly aroused by a bang,
•and discovered that a wild turkey (species bustard)
had committed suicide through pecking the cap of
one of the cartridges. That was food, and now I
can send this along. [This incident ought to be
in a Blandolt melodrama and save the hero’s life
at a critical moment, instead of just happening to
a plain Bill Dishtwister. .Our correspondent is
plainly truthful. He even gives the species of
the turkey.]
A FUTILE EXPERIMENT.
“ Why, what's up, Bill ?"
“ Ordered a quart off his Nibs, and then sug-
gested payment on the hire system."
“ F.H.R.” : In North Gippsland you
don t always get a miner for a mate under-
ground. One of my mates was a carpenter, and
was kept to do odd jobs at that profession in be-
tween turning drills and shovelling mullock. I
worked six months with him, and had to beat in
all the holes, as he was no hammerman. My last
mate, Scotty, was a sailor. He owed his position
to his ability to splice wire ropes, which were used
on the tramway. Still a good sailor is not neces-
sarily a success as a miner. I let him fire a hole
in a rise once. I sent him an extra long fuse and
told him to see that it “spit,” i.e.— lighted—and
also to place the headboards on carefully before
coming down. He saw it spit, he told me after-
wards, but saw nothing on the way down the
90ft. of pass. Still, his time down was a record
The pass was wet and slimy, and Scotty lost his
head when the fuse lit, and dropped his candle. It
was a good go between him and the candle, for lie
never touched a rung of the ladder with his feet.
In fact, if he had had another 50ft. to go he
reckoned he would have overtaken the stick of
grease. He fell with a thud. But his fear was
worse than his injury, and he dashed past me like
a bolting truck as I stood back in a niche. Then
the top of the drive stooped down and hit him
heavily on the head, and outed him. After
what seemed two years to him, he opened his
eyes and just then the shot banged. When I
went up, one board was off altogether and a piece
of slate about 501 b. weight was hanging gingerly,
no doubt waiting for Scotty to start up before it
fell.
“ Parapluie ” : Was fishing on a northern
river once with four other fellows. It was night,
and getting late, fish not biting, everybody drowsy.
The fellow next to me, propped up against a post,
fell asleep with his line in the stream. I felt a
craving for excitement, so got a tin plate from the
tent, put a small hole in the centre of it, pulled in
the sleeper’s line, attached the tin plate by the
hole in the centre, and gently lowered the line
into the water again. The tide was running out.
and carried the plate with it. Reaching the end
of the line, it gave a jerk, and gyrated across the
stream, jerked again, and started up stream till
the tide caught it broadside. Then it jerked some
•more. The sleeper was awake by this time, and
shouted that he had a bite. Then began some
high-class fish play. That plate went up stream,
across and back, down to the bottom, on to the
surface—in fact, it went through more gyrations
per minute than any old fiathead ever dreamt of.
It took the fisherman ten minutes to land the dish,
and as many more to say what he thought of us.
Then he started back for the tent, fell over his line,
struck the wharf hard, threw the line furiously in
the water, again stated what he thought of us,
and went to bed. Try fishing for plates. It’s
great fun.

“Mouse”: It was at the bush darnce.
Cocky Brown was M.C., and did the swearing
and “rousing” to perfection. After a bit, he
called out: “ Now then, lads, saddle yer fillies fer
the larnoers,” and met with such a response that
presently there was only one couple wanted to
complete things. Brown glared about, and finally
pounced on young Smith, who was grinning round
the door. “ ’Ere you, Bill Smith,” yelled Brown,
“’ook in ’ere and fill up this panel.” Smith
looked round helplessly at the rows of grinning
“ heifers ’’ and their blokes, and finally muttered :
“Can’t git a skirt, boss. Tber weaners is all
gone.” Brown thought hard a moment, and
suddenly thought of Mrs. Brown, sitting dis-
consolately in a corner. “Say, Bill,” he roared,
“ wot about my ole lump er greenhide over ’ere ?”
Bill looked bard a moment at the article in
question. Then he sidled over to her. “Yairs,”
he slid. “S’pose she’ll do.” And with that the
concertina struck up.

“ F.H.R.” : Yes, the bike has come into
the bush to stay, but it is essentially the sober
man’s hack. It’s a drunken sort of vehicle at any
time, is a bike, and I have yet to find the man who
could ride one home after pub-time when carrying
a cargo of alcohol. I remember in the early
dairying days, when the boys all owned horses,
that we made a habit of riding into town every
Saturday night to get drunk. We were very
quiet in the town. We just went from one pub
to another while the horses enjoyed a good
feed, and with rude, homely jokes, “filled
em up again.” A\ hen 11 o’clock came we
each got a lemonade bottle full of rum—
it was always rum. for whisky and brandy
were then looked upon as “toffs’”
drinks, and something aristocratic. Then
the horses we rode in so carefully were
brought out—and how they knew their
business ! They hardly gave us time to
lurch into the saddles before they went
for home full gallop, amid rousing
“Who’oops” and “Ho’hays” from the
merry riders. The horses generally
stopped on their own account half-way
up some steep hill, and there the strag-
glers would be waited for, and the roll
called, between drinks from somebody’s
bottle. Then the hot, reeking horses
were at it again. At the next stop-
somebody’s sliprails—young Mat would
be missing, and a rider would gallop back
and find Mat lying on the ground, still
holding the bridle, while the horse was
still as death for fear of treading on
him. Or perhaps the horse’s head
would be turned to the fence, and both
the horse and the rider be found fast
asleep. Oh, those rollicking, drunken
gallops ! How many escapes we had !
And the horses ? All the grooming they
got on being let go, reeking with sweat,
white with lather from neck to tail—all
the grooming they got was a belt on the
rump with the bridle as they started
straight for the cool, limpid water of the
creek. They were none the worse for it
n<'x:t day, nor were we. We would be out
at 3 a.m. next morning (Sunday), and would
send a dog round in the dark for enough
cows to put us through till daylight. Never a
thought of a “head,” but “How long have
Simpsons been at it ? ” and “Who’ll be first in at
the factory ?’’ was all that troubled us. And that
afternoon those boys on those same horses could
be seen riding decorously beside their best girls
to church.

“Janor”: In many of the Gippsland
forests, this winter, ' the growth of fungi is
phenomenal; and very beautiful in form and
brilliant in coloring are some of the humble
vegetables. The mushroom pattern is the most
common; others resemble bunches of coral;
others, again, look like miniature clumps of
dwarfed trees, delicately modelled in wax. Colors
are all shades of red, yellow, pink, and brown.
1 measured a huge scarlet toadstool the other
day. It was lOin. in diameter, and would have
made a showy parasol. Have failed to find any
growth of the Maoriland edible fungus (edible for
Chows). Seeing that M.L. exports large quan-
tities of the leathery substance, its introduction
into Australian forests would add to our great
natural resources. Local growths have no
economic use. -Now and again an odd bushman
fashions for himself a razor-strop from fungus.
He selects the big white spongy fellow, which
mostly grows well up the trunk of a big tree,
and resembles a blob of snow. When harvested,
it is soft and easily cut to the desired shape, and
when hardened by exposure to the air, it makes a
bosh ter strop—in fact, nothing boshterer can be
imagined.
“Jeff”: “ Janor’s ” yarn (B. 6/6/’O7)
that the laughing Jack avoids a lire snake is
rot. On more than one occasion have seen
“ Jack ” swoop down, seize a snake and carry it
wriggling about 100 ft. into the air. and then drop
it. Immediately the amazed reptile hit the earth,
J. was on to it again, the original assault being
repeated till the victim showed signs of faintness.
As a final remedy the bird always took his prey
to a handy limb, and thereon bashed it to death.
Once and for all. Jack is not a carrion eater,
but, like the aborigine, kills his own food—let it
be grub, worm, snake, or bird.

Guard the health of your family by keeping

ANO Til ER ROYAL CON VERSION.
King William, of Currabubula , has gone over to the Salvation Army.
What sort of a snort was
there when a recent daily published the informa-
tion that the white men of the Territory are
nearly always accompanied on their travels by
lubras ! Of course this good crowd immediately
jumped to the conclusion that the lubra was
carried for immoral purposes. Now, any man
that has had much travelling in nigger country
knows that for a safe and reliable pilot the lubra
can’t be beaten. She is worth a paddock-full of
bucks. Besides, treat her well, and she is a guar-
dian angel. Ask any of the old hands how many
times their lives have been saved through a
timely warning from the lubra. One instance:
I was travelling from Katherine to Victoria Biver,
and had just got into bad country. Had with
me a black trooper (lent to me by the police,
and, by the way, he was no good to me, though he
devoured a lot of tucker) and a lubra. We had
arrived at an ideal camping spot, and decided to
spend the next day there. Nancy, however, was
very anxious, and repeatedly warned me that
“ plenty nigger walk about and no gottem lubra.”
(A had sign that last.) I simply decided to keep
good watch, being- rather conceited about my
bushcraft. I was dozing when I smelt a strong
odor of nigger. Just turning my eyes, I saw a
form crouching near my bunk, and was going to
shoot, when Nancy’s voice reassured me: “No
shoot ’em, boss—sh-h-h-h —plenty nigger sit down
longa grass; birneby throw ein spear.” Yet my
dog lay undisturbed. Rather dubious, I was
about to get up ; but Nancy clutched me
quickly, saying : “ No walk about, boss, gib
it gun.” Handing my rifle to her, she
cautioned me to keep quiet; then getting her
thumb on the lever controlling the breech, she
threw it open with a loud snap. The effect was
electrical ; about thirty bucks, armed, jumped
from their lairs, and fled. When I asked Nancy
how she detected their presence, she told me
that she had seen them following us all day, and
then she saw them surround the camp. I had
ridden around the camp two or three times before
sundown, and had seen no signs. But Nancy
soon enlightened me : “ One feller come sit down
longa grass. Crawl like snake. No see him head.
No see him tail. Bimehy plenty fly come. Nancy
see him fly. Nancy know him fly sit down longa
buck.” There is not the slightest doubt that
Nancy saved my life that night. As far as the
protection the trooper and the dog afforded me, I
might just as well have had Judkins with me.

“Mangrove”: “Flinderino” (B. 2/5/’O7)
should be fined the maximum penalty for either
cruelty or sheer cussedness—it matters not which.
To swim a horse is simplicity itself. Put a halter
on him, pull him up close to the gunwale, and
grip him by the ear. He then makes no attempt
to swim or back-paddle—just allows himself to be
pulled along. In this way, two men (one at the oars)
can swim a horse any distance. There is no need
either to drown him, or to strangle him, or to
turn him loose on the ocean where, being unable
to see the land over the tops of the waves, he is
as likely to head for the South Pole as for the
shore.
“Agricola”: Two of the station bulls
found occasion for argument the other day, and,
after a display of bush-smashing and dirt-rooting,
agreed to arbitrate the matter in the usual
manner of bulls. There was also a small matter
of a side wager—the white bull backing himself to
the extent of a dozen cows, while the red bull
staked his harem of ten. As they closed and
temporarily disappeared in a cloud of dust, the
side wager formed a ring to see fair play, and
s « em « d to he more interested in the details of the
%ht than in the ultimate issue. The- omhat was
herce for a while, but after the third round the
weight of the red hull began to tell, and in the
fifth round the white hull turned and fled for his
life and the scrub. The victor solemnly, but
carefully, rounded up the stakes, and with them
proceeded in the opposite direction. The stakes
changed oyer without any visible reluctance, with
the exception of a black poley bet, who broke away,
anc l returned to her former lord. Since then the
defeated one has not been able to increase his
harem beyond that one, and ir really seems, from
the way the other cows regard her, as though she
has degraded; herself in like manner to a married
woman who has bolted with the bloke she likes
better than her own.
“ Papuan ” writes :
The Papuan Commission report is already producing
good results. Quite a number of the incapables in the
service are getting out, recognising that otherwise they
will be passed out. One of them, a very young magis-
trate, put in power by the Chief Johnny who formerly
ran this show, gave as his reason for resigning that lib
“can no longer with honor continue to serve the present
Government.” As a dignified retreat, this is about the
record. Judge Murray is shaking things up for the good
of this country.

A STAKE IN THE COUNTRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ties is a song of splendid sloth, of lazy seasons spent
With pleasant folk amid the smoke of excellent cigars,
Where gladness shines in amber wines—gay followin'-- my
bent °
In rosy days and rosier nights at gilded city bars ;
Or, out of Melbourne, ranging down my hundred square-
mile plot,
An ambling course upon my horse, calm, dignified, and
slow ;
.Sure this, for me, is gloriously a well-deservfed lot—
To lounge in town, or watch, up here, my golden fleeces
grow.
Out in the sun my toilers sweat, sheer-stripped to breech
and sark-
Well-tried, well-broke, to bear the yoke of service on their
necks—
A-making hay, this summer’s day, from fragrant dawn to
dark ;
While I, in this cool room, I also labor—signing cheques.
Out in the green my sweaters strive, or in the yards afar,
As I, with pen thrown down again, seek out a place 1
know
Where I can taste, with decent haste, joy from the
whisky-jar,
And go out, glad, and hearken to my golden fleeces grow.
This is my duty plain—to make my vassals earn their
board,
'To hold firm hands upon my lands, to swell my chest
and keep
A certain place among my race, as fatted overlord,
And teach the lean and landless herd to reverence my
sheep.
By these, my swarming servants, do I find financial bliss ;
From them (dirt cheap, fifteen and keep) my thumping
profits flow ;
My silver-lure is ever sure—and well am I in this
Repaid, as now I listen to my golden fleeces grow.

"POLICE! POLICE!!”
The whole system of our police and detective work comes under serious review at a time like the present when the natural order of
things is reversed. The force is quite at a loss; criminals seem to be chasing the police.— Argus, Melbourne.


PERSONAL
ITEMS
A domestic event of the week is the birth
of a daughter to Mr. and Mrs. John Norton, of
Sydney.
Tuesday, June 18th, Archbishop (R.C.)
Murphy, of Hobart, will enter his 93rd year. He
has been 70 years a priest, and has worn the
mitre for 61 years. He is the oldest mitred man of
any creed in the world.
Major Legge, one of the smartest and
most industrious officers the Commonwealth owns,
has been transferred from Sydney to Melbourne,
to the Intelligence Staff. It’s a staff which can
do with some more intelligence.
The Maorilander, John Langford Crumpe
(over 70 years of age), who shot the widow of
barrister Moriarty Crumpe, of Launceston, in
England, over a family matter, has been adjudged
insane and confined to a lunatic asylum.
It is officially announced that Samuel Cook
has retired from active service as the general
manager of Sydney Morning Herald and Syd-
ney Mail. Fifty-three years ago he took up a
position as comp, on the Herald, and has worked
up all grades since.
Following from Gilmore’s “Personal Re-
collections of Lincoln,” which was addressed by
Lincoln to Davis, might interest J. Carruthers :
I have heaid of your doctrine of “State Rights,”
which, translated into plain English, is that a part is
greater than the whole, and we Americans are not a
people, but a political partnership.
Seal Rocks (N.S.W.), close to which the
Catterthun was wrecked, loses lighthouse-keeper
Williams, who retires with a pension after over a
quarter of a century of stormy nightwork on this
brow of the Pacific. Williams brought up a family
in his wild nest, and managed to marry no less
than eight children from the social outpost he
held.
Donald Campbell, of Ballarat, a “ringer”
who gave evidence in the Federal Arbitration
Court last week in the suit to fix the shearers’
pay, was model for the wool-shed picture, now
in Sydney Art Gallery. Campbell is a tough
warrior. He has been “ringing” his sheds—
never getting lower than third on the tally—for
12 years.
Ex-Justice M. H. Stephen, of N.S.W.
Bench, passes his evening of pensioned life as
patron or committeeman of churches, charities
and school assemblies. In a few months he will
face his white-headed 80th birthday. He is a
dear, kindly fellow—“ the most perfect gentleman
on the Bench,” the Bar used to say—with the
suave modesty and manner of a high-class Angli-
can curate.
Charles A. Murphy, the man who gave
Adelaide what, for a time, was its brightest
satirical weekly, the Lantern, died the other
day. Murphy, who came from N’York, was a
rolling stone until a wife and a family of a dozen
or thereabouts cemented him down, and he be-
came a sharebroker, and an American vice-consul,
and an otherwise “right-thinking person,” for
whom the Adelaide Town Hall bells tolled on his
death.
John Forrest has just scored, though not
directly in his own political line, through the
opening of the Westralian Government Agency
in Collins Street, Melbourne. His fine, large,
Roman hand can be traced in that. The agent in
charge is Mr. Ranford, who until lately had charge
of the Perth Information Bureau —a good man for
the post. Ranford was a surveyor with John
Forrest, and laid out Wyndham (W.A.).
THE TENANT FARMER'S NIGHTMARE.
The 17-year-old daughter of one Aus-
tralian Cabinet Minister lost most of the bone of
the lower jaw, as the result of a painful ailment,
and the loss has been made good with an appara-
tus of celluloid. The operation is a perfect suc-
cess, and there is no outward indication that the
young lady is not normally constructed, The old
man’s enemies say that he is responsible for the
trouble—that he has, in fact, worn out all the jaw
the family is likely to have for four generations.
A big Australian newspaper man, ban-
tered by a number of cronies at table on his in-
ability to see a joke, replied gravely : “I can see
a joke as quick as ony man, but I dinna always
recognise it.” The same humorist once pointed
to a paragraph in an article by a privileged
member of his staff, and said: “What on earth
is this?” “Oh, that’s a little paragraph, meant to
be funny, you know,” replied the proud author.
“ Oh, meant to be funny, is it?” said the great
man. “Then we’d better have it out—it might
be.”
Tom Laby, a bright Sydney youth who
was recently awarded a lucrative scholarship,
founded in 1851 at the great London Exhibition,
and who proceeded to Cambridge University for
study, has just been awarded his B. A. degree.
Laby, whose hobby is science, attracted notice by
some original work in radio-activity at Sydney
’Varsity laboratory.
R. B. Richards, who had charge of the
second cutter (containing the women and children)
in the Birkenhead wreck
in 1852, celebrated his
golden wedding (15/6/’O7)
at MeOrea-street, Dan-
dendong(Vic.). The old
man is still well and
strong, though he is 70
years of age.
HE HAD
DONE
THINGS.
UNCLE: “ You
know you’re a
man’s age no w,
and it’s time
you did some-
thing to show
you are a man.”
NEPHEW: “ Er ! I
pefwer not to
overdo it at first. I’ve
had two bweaches of
promise, and been co-
respondent once, and I owe
four figures, and I’ve got hob-
nailed liver. I think that’s very
well for a beginning. Plenty of time to bwanch
out into big things by and bye.”
Died on June 7th, at Casino (N.S. W.), aged
62, A. A. Devlin, stock inspector—an excellent
judge of cattle, who had studied at the Pasteur
Institute, Paris. Although short of stature, he
took somewhere in the vicinity of 20st. of flesh
and bone and other things with him wherever he
went. It was his brother who, upon joining the
firm of Harrison and Jones (now Harrison, Jones
and Devlin), gave rise to the horrible conundrum,
“ Why are Harrison and Jones the wisest men in
Sydney?” The reply to this was—“ Because
they took the devil in.”
Mrs. Balcombe, who died at East Mel-
bourne recently, aged 85, came of a family which
knew Napoleon I. well. Her father was Dr.
Reid, the naval surgeon of the ship that took the
great one to St. Helena. Her father-in-law,
William Balcombe, was employed at St. Helena,
and made the acquaintance of Napoleon there.
Reid came to N.S. Wales, and settled at Inverary,
near Goulburn. In 1824 William Balcombe
followed, with the appointment of Colonial
Treasurer, the first of the office. Before Napoleon
went to Longwood he stayed at “The Briars”
with the Balcombes.
The Rev. R. C. Fillingham writes at
length to the Westminster Gazette (London) in
defence of the genuineness of the late ’Lijah
Dowie, of the purple wings and the odoriferous
eloquence. Gist of the Fillingham discourse
“ My deliberate conviction is that he hypnotised
himself and convinced himself —absurd as it seems
to us—that he was Elijah the Restorer.” This
suggests a Criminal Court argument for the mis-
understood confidence man : “No, I ain’t got no
rich uncle in Fiji, but I ’ypnotised meself and
’im (indicating victim) into a belief that I ’ad—
’specially ’im !”
L. J. Maxse, editor of the London
National Review, to the Morning Post on
Deakin :
During the last fortnight we have lost the intellectual
treat of reading some of the most inspiring utterances
ever delivered in this country—inspiring because spoken
from the heart of a great orator, a great statesman, and
a great patriot—to the nation at large. Whether Mr.
Deakin’s speeches can be recovered I do not know, but it
has been heart-breaking to his enthusiastic hearers on
many occasions, on opening their newspapers next morn-
ing, to find that, whereas less interesting observations of
less interesting speakers may he reported with some ful-
ness, his speeches are either unreported or compressed
beyond recognition.
What ails the only King O’Malley ? Ten
years ago he carried a six-shooter at his hip, and
kept himself fit with boxing practice in the back
office of an insurance firm in Adelaide. To-day
he goes meekly into a Melbourne court, and asks
them to send a policeman to eject one of his non-
paying tenants. The O’Malley is clearly not so
flamboyant as in the days when he burst upon the
Goolwa (S.A.) district as candidate for Encounter
Bay against the late Henry Downer. Then a
hundred girls in white marched to his hotel to
greet him, and he marched proudly at their head
to Brewery Hall, where an address of welcome
was read.
Charles M. Alexander, the Yankee Gospel
agent, whose late mission fell so flat, is said to
have made a promising speculation in securing
the exclusive publication rights of a number of
hymns and poems written by a Bendigo poet—
Mr Fred P. Morris. Mr. Morris holds a position
in the sub-Treasury at Bendigo. The composi-
tions are to be set to music by Mr. Robert Hark-
ness, an Australian pianist, who toured the world
with the Torrey-Alexander troupe. The poet
intends to devote the proceeds of his compositions
towards the development of Christian work. Up
to the present Charles M. Alex, has not hinted
what he will do with any dollars which may come
his way.
The death is announced of Henry Hicks
Hocking, who was Attorney-General of Westralia
from 1872 to 1879, and was Acting Chief Justice,
1873-74. He was called to the Bar at the Inner
Temple in 1865. On leaving Australia, he was ap-
pointed Acting Chief Justice at Gibraltar (1879-80)
and after that became Attorney-General of
Jamaica, with a seat on the Executive Council.
An ex-Australian squatter died recently
at Greenwich (Eng.). John Taylor was born in
Ireland in 1834, and came to Sydney in 1857. He
got his land-legs by doing some building and con-
tracting ; then “the land” called him, and he
responded cheerfully by taking on a job at
Cornish’s station, on the Lower Macquarie.
He stayed there j ust long enough to see how
things were done, and then started out to
show how the wool could be made to fly
when a really energetic person got to work.
He bought Hunthawang station, of 375.000
acres, on the Lachlan River,
and three months later added
to it the adjoining Mer-
rowie (160,000 acres).
After three years he
sold out, and
bought, and
stocked with
sheep, Care-
well and Mo-
bella stations,
in the Coon-
amble district.
He again
sold out, and
bought Wir-
rah, on the
Bar won; stock-
ed it up, and
sold out some
more. Next he
bought Kid-
gar, on the
Castlereagh ;
Dobikin (near Nar-
rabri); Glenalvon (Mur-
rurundi) and Toeralle (Gun-
nedab). And then he wearied
of buying, and stocking-up, and
selling out, so he handed the
“ bit o’ land ” over to the manage,
ment of his sons, and went off
to see what the world is like
where the jumbucks cease from
troubling, and the retired
squatter may live on the best.
The diamond merchant,
Julius Bauer, who was assas-
sinated in his Collins Street
(Melb.) office recently, com-
menced business as watch
and jewellery importer at
Minerva Chambers, 126 Pitt
Street, Sydney, in 1887. He
was one of the jewellery merchants attracted by
the Centenary celebrations of 1888.

Frank Gardner, of the “Sitting Bull”
countenance, is feeding on trouble these days.
Lately Carrie Swain renewed her action for half
the fortune her late partner doesn’t seem to have ;
then one of his old Westralian cos. reckoned up
what its late chairman had borrowed, and
alleged that the amount still owing was
something over £60,000 ; and now a
foreign lady—variously described
as Swedish and Spanish—has got
judgment against him in England
ifor £827,000. The foreign lady
says she furnished the ex-Aus-
tralian theatrical plunger with
vast sums for investment.
Frank has not had much luck
since he took King Ned for a
brief motor ride, and pulled
up at one point, where a
photographer just happened
to be stationed, and incurred
the wrath of Royalty when
the picture was subsequently
printed. “ Sitting Bull ” pro-
bably thought that to be
photographed in the act of
entertaining the Throne would
be a sort of pass for life over
all lines for any Wild Cats he took under his wing.
By the way, the fascinating actress who en-
gineered the King’s consent to ride in a motor
with Gardner hasn’t had much luck since, either.
There is likely to be a change in the leader-
ship of the S.A. Labor party through Yard on
being declared null and void as a Senator. The
Parliamentary Laborites are inclined to give
Archibald a lift to the Federal House, and if they
do it won’t be difficult to find a more tactful
leader in his place. Roberts, Senior, and the
McSmeaton —who is general of the gaudy High-
land fragment of a regiment—are mentioned.
Roberts is ambitious, clever, and about the best
fighting debater of the House, but his bitter
tongue detracts from his personal popularity.
Senior is able, popular on both sides of the
Assembly, and has an excellent chance of election
if Archibald goes. The only man who gives
Smeaton a chance yet awhile is Smeaton.

Melbourne’s most swagger restaurant. Recalls

“ Say, Champion, which dost roost affect—
Labor’s austere, or Capital’s fat sect ? ”
“ Friend, ’tis my aim throughout this earthly hobble,
. With these to gabble, and with those to gobble.”
Withal, why shouldn’t the Socialist have the best
dinner the occasion warrants and the cash will
run to ?

A Miss Loane has published her experi-
ences as a London district nurse, in a book
entitled “ The Next Street But One.” She speaks
strongly of the amateur philanthropists who
undertake to distribute help to the poor, and
who, going into the homes of women quite as
good, if not as well-to-do, as themselves, display,
without meaning to be offensive, a senseless
impertinence and tactlessness which merit kick-
lng. Of course, the poor are a perverse lot who
should be severely dealt with. Miss Loane gives
an instance:—
A lady was telling me of a large school-treat in which
she had personally assisted. The children had been taken
about 20 miles out of London, and when they returned at
9.00, and were met by a great crowd of parents, it was
discovered that three little girls were missing, and the
mothers were quite disagreeable about it. Quite dis-
agreeable because —at the very best—their children were
crying themselves to sleep at a police-station, while the
worst could scarcely be spoken of.
There ! Could anything be more inconsiderate or
ungrateful? “Quite disagreeable” to the good,
kind lady who had helped to lose their children.
Really, the arrogance of the lower orders is dis-
tressing 1
The British Navy is at last beginning to
get some modern ideas of personal cleanliness,
the Dreadnought, which the colonial Premiers
recently inspected at Portsmouth, is actually
provided with bathrooms for the ordinary seamen.
On other warships a tiny “bath ’’-tub, which
hardly admits of the insertion of a pair of police-
size feet, has, usually to serve some twelve or
fourteen men without change of water, which is
not too pleasant even if all of them are heal y
in the skin.
Last week there died at Parramatta Gaol,
in the lunacy wing, a pianoforte-tuner. Tims
after time he had been convicted of disgusting
sexual “crimes.” The law was in the habit of
capturing him, punishing him, and then releasing
him to find another child victim. For his last
offence he was ordered a flogging. He was ill
and could only stand a certain number of strokes
with the cat. He collapsed, and the officials for-
bore to administer the rest of the lashing. From
that incomplete flogging the wretch drifted to the
hospital, then to the “observation ” ward, and he
died a madman. In all human probability he was
a madman, not only when he was flogged, but
when he was convicted, and also when he offended.
Once again : the abnormal sex offender is usually
a lunatic. Society should shut him up for good.
To flog him is barbarous. To flog and release
him, barbarous and foolish.
A good postal performance. A letter was
posted at Adelaide, addressed “ , Goose-
neck, Murray River.” The official who handled
it recognised that something unusual was de-
manded of him. He decided to work on a system.
A goose-neck may be taken to mean any bend in
the stream that likens itself to the swallowing
part of the bird. The bird can adjust its neck to
any curve. Hence a goose-neck means any old
curve in the river at all. Recent calculations
state that there are thousands of goose-necks in
the course of the Murray, the majority being in
the upper part of the river. The letter was
despatched to the source, to be worked down.
After months of futile search it transpired at
Albury, weary, and so overladen with date-stamp
ink that it was overweight. It got its second
wind, and was again sent in pursuit of the
addressee. It zigzagged backwards and forwards
in coach, punt, and ferry, and called unsuccess-
fully at every post-office on both sides of the
Murray till it sat down to rest at Wentworth. It
had to call at every post-office, for every post-
office was near two or three goose-necks. At
Wentworth it was claimed. The journey occu-
pied 375 days, and for dogged perseverance it
deserves a mention.

“0.K.” : Naturalists are disposed to pro-
test against the “Gorilla and Woman” sculpture
(lately presented to Melbourne National Gallery),
on the ground that it is a nasty-minded piece of
nonsense. Professing to be a Zolaesque work of
realism it is essentially fraudulent, and in its
sensational aspect appeals only to the un-
informed. The gorilla of fiction was introduced
to America and Europe by Du Chaillu when he
returned from Africa in 1861, bringing with him
several stuffed specimens of the gorilla of fact.
Winwood Reade followed the tracks of Du
Chaillu in 1862, and in his “ African Sketch
Book ” (1873), which includes a brief recapitula-
tion of his previously-published travels, he deals
with the man-monkey question in a calm, casual
manner. In this “African Sketch Book” of
Winwood Reade we get no encouragement to
acceptFremiet’sfigures of “Gorilla and Woman”
as a presentment of anything possible in nature.
The ape, standing on its hind legs with a negress
held to its breast by one arm, is a work of ima-
gination, suggested by the fictitious tales of Du
Chaillu.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
In six weeks since the official opening of Sand-
ford’s Lithgow ironworks (N.S.W.) 3635 tons of pigiron
have been produced ; and several hundred tons had been
turned out before that. It is good iron, and most of the
N.S. Wales market is safe enough ; but, under present
conditions, it is very doubtful if the co. can get the inter-
state trade, because foreign iron is brought out to Mel-
bourne and other ports for next to nothing as ballast,
and the inter-State shipping will not, of course, carry
Sandford’s iron on those terms. Partly as the result of
that, partly because N.S. Wales merchants have foreign
stocks accumulated and on the water, and partly
because the iron market has been falling and
merchants don’t buy largely on a falling market, there
is already an accumulation of 3000 tons of iron at the
works: and, since the costs have been a good deal higher
than had been figured on, it is not possible to profitably
get rid of the stock by reducing the price. The business is,
therefore, understood to be in some danger, the more so
as, in spite of the heavy costs, the workmen don’t regard
the present pay as satisfactory. The remedy is either to
increase the tariff protection or to do something by way
of a Federal bonus : one of the anomalies of the present
tariff is that black sheets for galvanising are admitted
absolutely duty free. Meantime, also, the co. finds that,
in order to carry out contemplated works, more capital
will have to be got in, and a proposal will shortly be made
to increase it from £150,000 to £250,000, by offering
100,000 new shares to the public.

Things have changed. Twelve months ago it was esti-
mated that the Assets Board, over to whom the most
hopeless-looking of the business had been turned, had
made such progress in the matter of realising assets
(aided, of course, by the transfer of very large amounts of
current bank profits) that it would show a surplus. In
terms, therefore, of the bank’s Act, application was
made for a valuation ; aqd that valuation having shown
that a surplus did exist, the Assets Board expired. The
remaining assets were taken over by the bank, which
then became free to do what it pleased With its profits.
In accordance with the last arrangement made between
the State and the bank, the heavy interest of the former in
the concern was divided up into £1,000,000 of 4 per cent.
Guaranteed Stock, and £500,000 of preference capital.
These preference shares carry first 5 per cent. ; after that
they take 1 per cent, for every 2 per cent, paid on ordi-
nary shares, but the pref. div. stops at 10 per cent.
Therefore, for the past year, while the pref. capital gets
7J per cent., ordinaries get 10 per cent.' ; and when pref.
shares get 10 per cent., ordinaries will be entitled to 15
per cent, at least. The Guaranteed Stock is repayable in
1914 ; and evidently partly with the intention of getting
rid of this liability, a start has been made to rapidly build
up a reserve fund under the present highly favorable con-
ditions.
On the 150,000 ordinary shares £3 6s. Bd. is paid,
and another £3 6s. Bd. (£500,000) may be called up. A
point of interest to ordinary shareholders is whether it
would be better to pay up further capital, or let the
capital stay where it is, and increase the rate of dividend.
The “ draw ” of each at various rates works out like this :
Preference. Ordinary.
£ £ £ £
7$ p.c. on 500,000 = 37,500 10 p.c. on 500,000= 50,000

7£ „ „ „ „ 37,500 10 „ „ 1,000,000 „ 100,000
Ordinaries, of course, want to get the most they can out
of the business at the smallest cost in the shape of
preference dividend; and it is plain that, without in-
creasing the preference dividend at all, they can get a
very handsome 10 per cent, on another £500,000, or, in
all, £lOO,OOO ; on the other hand, to get that much with-
out increasing capital they must make their dividends
20 per cent., and, in that case, preference shareholders
will have to get £50,000, or £12,500 more than at present.
Twenty per cent, banking dividends are, however, inad-
visable in these days. They practically can’t be paid
unless the bank has the use of far too much of the public’s
money in proportion to capital. The prudent course will
be to increase the paid capital of this bank. That will
have the same effect as an increase of ordinary dividend,
and it will also give the bank’s creditor customers more
security. At present, apart from the bank’s Guaranteed
Stock, the bank’s capital and reserves represent less
than 13 per cent, of the non-liquid assets. In the Bank of
N.S. Wales capital and reserves were at the last balance
equal to over 17 per cent, of non-liquid assets ; and even
that was not thought enough, wherefore the capital has
now been increased. For the Bank of New Zealand share-
holders’ funds to reach 17£ per cent, of the non-liquid
assets, they must be increased from £1,281,675 to
£1,750,000, either by raising fresh capital or by the
increase of reserves ; and, of course, as reserves increase,
the advances, etc., have a way of increasing too. The
bank’s safest course is, therefore, to take time well
by the forelock and get in more capital.
Meantime, it is an amazingly prosperous busi-
ness. Even reckoning the £1,000,000 of Guaranteed Stock
as capital, the profit in the past year was at the rate of
£l6 10s. sd. per cent, of capital and reserves. (And from
the profit, as shown in the table, £7OOO, in addition to
the ordinary grant, has been taken, and added to the
Provident Fund.) No other Australasian bank can show
such figures. As to the progress of the business in some

Assets Board debentures, which the bank had bought up,
have for some years been a good source of revenue ; for-
tunately the money has found other outlets. The
premises account has been written down hard; in 1895
it stood at £420,000. Yet many additions have been made
in the meantime. Altogether, the position looks very
sound, and the recovery sheds glory on Maoriland’s policy
of the last 12 years. The one doubt that lingers springs
out of the State’s incomprehensible mania for borrowing.
That policy must end some day ; when it does, there is a
danger of a bad slump in property values ; for, while bor-
rowed money flows in, values must be inflated.

The Melbourne Trust, Ltd., formed in 1903
to take over the affairs of three assets cos., which had
been formed six years before to take over the affairs of
three boom “banks”:—

1905 .. 4610 Nil 6393
1906 .. 9925 4J per cent. =£11,958 4360
The three assets cos. alluded to above were the Melbourne
Assets Co. (which was the undertaker to the Oity of Mel-
bourne Bank), the Federal Assets 00. (the Federal Bank
of Australia), and the English and Australian Assets Co.
(the English and Australian Mortgage Bank). The
creditors of these three “banks” were much the same
people, and after the smash they worked in sorrow
together until the assets cos. were formed in 1897 ; and
then, after talking about it for four years, they
fixed up a complete amalgamation of interests in 1903
under the title of the Melbourne Trust, Ltd. The new
concern had a nominal capital of £320,000 in 4s. shares ;
and this capital (or as much of it as was issued) was cut
up as follows (the amount is shown per share of the assets
co.): —
4 per cent.

The debentures issued totalled £392,485 ; of the shares
1,366,666 were issued (£273,333); and £20,704 was paid in
cash. One of the conditions was that profits made out of
the sale of properties or from the repurchase of debentures
should not be distributed as dividends until all the
debentures had been paid off. In other words, the
debentures were to have an equivalent to a first mort-
gage over all the assets. A start was at once made to
get rid of the debentures, and this is what has hap-
pened :

1906 .. 189,579 72,804 648 31,274
Totals.. .. £202,906 £3613 £70,266
It has not been possible for the Melbourne Trust to
do much in the way of purchasing debentures at
a discount, because the lowest point in the market
reached by the stock in 1904 was 93 ; while in 1905
the London quotation shifted between 95J and 96J,
and in 1906 between 95 and 98. This, of course,
was natural in view of the co.’s success in property
sales. When the co. was formed in 1903, the interests
were apportioned on the basis of a valuation made in
1899 ; and for the £686,522 in debentures, shares, and
cash paid over, assets valued on the 1899 basis at £718,548
were acquired by the co. This showed a surplus of
£32,024. It was not clearly explained at the outset, but
apparently this surplus included £24,171, the amount of
the net profit on business and sales from the time when
the agreement to form the new co. -was made, to the time
when the new co. actually started. The events of the
three years and three months that have happened since
then have prompted the management to look at matters
from another point of view, and the result is an
announcement that “ the Australian assets, which
now figure in the balance-sheet as of the value
of £417,586, may reasonably be expected to pro-
duce a sum more nearly approximating £581,667,
assuming that the present policy of realisation be con-
tinued and sales effected at prices commensurate with
those obtained during the year under review.” This is
£164,081 ahead of the balance-sheet figure ; but that in-
cludes the £24,171 previously mentioned. In other
words, if the rest of the assets can be got off like those
that were got off last year, the shareholders will in the
end get something like this :
Surplus Estimated on Future Saks .. £164,081
Surplus from Past Sales, etc. .. .. 73,879
Profit and Loss Balance .. .. 4,360
Total .. £242,320
That is in addition to the par value of the shares, repre-
sented originally (and still) by assets. The total just
mentioned works out at 3s. 6d. per share. If, there-
fore, the remaining assets pan out like those that were
got rid of last year, the shares ought to be worth 7s. 6d.
in the end. In 1904 they moved between 2s. 3d. and
2s. 9d. ; in 1906, when something of w'hat was happening
leaked out, they got up to 7s. 6d. Just at present they
can be got for 6s. 6d. Everything depends upon the
valuation, and there is no way of testing that. Moreover,
many of the transactions are being carried through on
terms ; purchasers’ balances on December 31st amounted
to £111,045, and there is risk in that as well as in the
matter of the properties coming up to their new valua-
tion. And, though they may be sold at a profit, they
certainly don’t yield much by way of interest; the gross
return from the assets last year was only a shade over 5
per cent., and the net profit (apart from sales) showed
only £3 13s. per cent, on capital. That is a poor return on
shares at par (45.), and a good deal poorer on shares at a
premium (6s. 6d.); and that has to be taken into account,
as well as the probabilities of the assets panning out up
to the new expectations.

The more the affairs of Donaghy’s Rope and
Twine Co. (Maoriland) are stirred the worse they smell.
It was reported (B. 13/6/’O7) that, on an almost complete
change of directors, the assets had been written down by
£40,712 ; and the Board, in its annual report, recom-
mended that, after writing off reserves, the deficit—
£27,l28 —should be carried to profit and loss suspense
account. As remarked then, this was a weak way of
dodging the trouble. Later on, however, the Board
found that, through misunderstanding a wire, the posi-
tion was £2500 worse than had been supposed. That was
the last straw. The directors thereupon decided to face
the situation, and they will recommend an extraordinary
meeting to write shares down from £lO to £5. This will
provide £23,500 ; so there will still be £6128 of a profit
and loss debit.
It is a bad business, whose history is well
worth the attention of investors interested in “ in-
dustrials.” Originally there were three ropeworks,
Donaghy’s (Dunedin), the Auckland Co.’s, and the South-
land Co.’s (Invercargill). The last two were in the hands
of the Bank of New Zealand Assets Board. Donaghy’s,
owned by a private co. of which Lee Smith, M.L.C., was
managing director, was a very profitable concern ; but
the Bank Assets Board got the owners to believe that it
would be more profitable still if the three were amalga-
mated. A new co. was therefore formed, and the stock
was divided up. The promoters—who seem to have
been chiefly the Assets Board —saw that it wouldn’t
do to load the concern with a goodwill item.
The Board, whose business it was not to run ropeworks,
but to realise assets, knew that the public doesn’t like
paper assets in a balance-sheet, and that shares in a much-
papered concern are not easy to get rid of. So, instead
of putting anything down for goodwill, the promoters
adopted the remarkable course of valuing the machinery,
etc., on the basis of its earnings. On that basis, if a man
sitting in a chair were making £lOOO a year profit for the
co., the ehairwent down in the assets as worth £lOOO.
According to one director, “ the works were put down at
a certain price, and then the Assets Board and other pro-
prietors put on 50 per cent., and so they arrived at the
value that appeared in the books.” And after the assets
had thus been outrageously misrepresented, nothing
whatever appears to have been written off them for 12
years. If the shareholders had known that a huge
goodwill item was lurking in the balance-sheet, they
would, no doubt, have taken steps to write it down out
of profits. As it was, profits were divided up to the
hilt; and, on account of the fictitious appearance of great
prosperity thus presented, shares went up to £l3.
Then, or thereabouts, the Assets Board began
to unload. But a remarkable agreement had been made
between the Assets Board and the original Donaghy
people, who appear to have been mainly Lee Smith,
M.L.C., and his friends : when the Board sold shares, it
was stipulated that it should also sell shares for the other
crowd. Of three shares sold by the Board, one was
to come out of the other crowd’s bundle. The
result (if not the object) was plain. Nobody
took any notice when the Assets Board sold ; it was
its business to sell. But if it had been known that the
managing director and the rest of them were selling,
there would have been inquiries. So thorough was the
clearing-out that the books show that of the original
4700 shares belonging to the Assets Board and Lee Smith
and co. only 58 are now in their names. And as soon as
the clearing-out is practically complete, it is ascertained
that the original balance-sheet was ridiculously inflated
(to use a mild term), that goodwill was introduced and
made to masquerade as plant, etc., that nothing has been
written-off out of profits to cover depreciation through-
out all this period when the snares have been going
gradually on the market, and that now, on a revaluation,
all the reserves have to be written off, the shares (which
have been got rid of up to £l3) written down to £5, and
a large deficit is set by to be provided for out of future
profits.
• •
One other item in this most discreditable busi-
ness remains to be noted. Soon after the amalgamation
of the three works it was apparent that those at Inver-
cargill were valueless as a going concern, and those at
Auckland were not much better. Some directors, it
appears, wanted to write down the Auckland works, but
they were repeatedly told that “ an Australian company
had offered more than it was valued at to the present
co.” The present chairman (one of the old directors)
says that the former chairman told him so many times.
Even now Lee Smith says that there was “ an offer from
an Australian firm for the Auckland works at a much
higher price than ours.” Apparently it never occurred
to anybody to make any inquiries into this alleged offer,
which was allowed to grow up as an office myth ; and
when it did occur to one of the present directors to in-
quire, he promptly got this reply from the Australian
firm—“ Did not make offer.” Possibly in the long career
of misrepresentation a small item like that isn’t of much
consequence; but it is at least one more thing for the
responsible parties to explain.

This doesn’t look too cheerful ; and for the fall in profits
no explanation is officially offered. A comparison of the
profit and loss account figures simply shows that,
whereas the balance from working’ account in 1905
was £10,740, last year it was only £9029 ; but whether
that was due to heavier costs of production or keener
competition and lou'er prices doesn’t transpire. The
directors do, however, say that “in export markets there
has been a renewal of keen competition, producing a
marked depression in selling prices,” and that “ wages
have increased locally ” ; but then they add that “ neither
of these circumstances has yet existed long enough to
materially diminish the co.’s profit-earning powers.”
Apparently, therefore, these things are to cut still further
into the diminished earnings. The amount shown as
written off is directed to the plant item : apparently,
nothing is charged for wear and tear apart from that.
This item of plant is included in a lump with others—
“ Freeholds, leaseholds,, plant, goodwill, live and rolling
stock, £59,495”; and on the lump the amount written
off doesn’t amount to 1J per cent. Certainly it is
a great deal more reckoned on the basis of plant alone ;
but leaseholds and goodwill ought to be written down
too, and freeholds, whose value depends on their uncertain
salt supplies, might very fairly be treated the same way. -
It is pretty evident that, if the co. is earning its modest
dividend, it is doing no more—in which respect it is in
much the same state as the vast majority of poorly-pro-
tected Australian industrial enterprises.

This looks pretty sick ; and, so far as can be seen, Maori-
land’s shocking habit of living on credit is mostly
responsible for it. At first business was going to be all
cash, so that shareholders might get the benefit of rock-
bottom prices. But in a community where almost every
tradesman a month’s credit, the society soon found
that, though it had shareholders, it couldn’t get the
expected customers ; and therefore little by little the
cash basis has been cut away, commencing with the
tailoring branch and practically extending now all
through the business. This means bad debts, for one
thing, so the society’s net profits can’t be what they
ought to be. Still, though the start is disappointing,
success is not yet impossible ; for, if they choose, the
co-operators can still save for their own pockets the
profits which otherwise would go into somebody else’s.
At March 31st the paid capital was £4OlO.

Mr. W. Sandison writes: Re Goldsbrough, Mort

Last year, the Lake View Consols, Kalgoorlie,
treated 140,000 tons for an average profit of a little over
2s. per ton. So far, the results for this year work out at
about the same ; and, if wages are increased by the
Arbitration Court, it is declared that the orders of Govett
and Co. are to shut down. In that case, 400 men now on
its pay sheet would have to look elsewhere for employ-
ment. Other Kalgoorlie mines tipped to have their
mills hung up and their shafts battened down are the
Boulder Main Reef, Hannan’s Star, and South Kaigurli.

Last year the Hainault distributed three Is. divi-
dends and paid a fourth in January last. Since then it has
had a very lean time, and the prospect of dividends being
paid out of current profits for some months to come is
not bright. From January Ist to April 30th a surplus of
£4371 was shown from ore treatment, but the loss of
£914 made on last month’s operations reduced this to
£3457, which is less than half the sum required to pay a
Is. dividend. Of the £28,500 raised bj' the issue of 20,000
new shares at 28s. 6d., at the end of last year, to provide
for additional plant, a shade over £22,000 has been spent
to date. Since the beginning of the year the extrac-
tion value of ore has dropped from 30s. Id. to 265. 6d. per
ton.

Fortune seems to have at last favored Boulder
No. 1 in regard to the option held over St. George leases,
Magnet (W. A.). A lot of gold was won from this pro-
perty some years back, when it was known as the New
Chum. It was then acquired by an English co. for
£50,000. This concern pottered around for a time ; but
when the lode faulted, and a heavy flow of water was
struck at depth, it packed its tall hat and left. Subse-
quently a party of working prospectors came along and
discovered a big body of low-grade ore, now known as
the St. George lode ; and work done by the option-holders
on this formation is giving first-rate results.

The latest excuse given for the unsatisfactory
clean-up from the Ivanhoe Junction’s new mill is that a
heavy influx of water prevented stoping, and that most
of the stuff treated came from a surface dump of poor
ore. This is the third excuse offered, but it is no better
than the other two. Mine officials whimper that it is
unfair to condemn the mine until it has been given a fur-
ther trial. The answer to that is that its worthlessness
as a gold mine was proved before the decrepit mill
machinery was dumped on the ground. Meantime there
is another call of threepence to go on with. Poor share-

A recent attempt made in Kalgoorlie to form a
Citizens’ Development Syndicate, with a capital of £5OOO,
to prove the north end of the field, was a dismal failure. A
door-to-door canvass of Hannan’s Street business people
showed that some were not in, others had just gone out,
and the rest would think it over.

“Frenzied financing ” has raised sufficient capi-
tal to complete the Great Ophir’s new mill and bring this
Davvhurst (W.A.) mine to the producing stage. Though
in the opinion of some the Ophir is one of the best things
outside Kalgoorlie, investors had better leave the stock
alone until a statement of the co.’s position is placed in
black and white before shareholders, and until, also, the
manager’s calculations are borne out. At present there
is something about the concern which does not inspire
confidence.

Westralia Mount Morgans is again in trouble.
The £22,000 raised by the issue of preference shares fifteen
months ago has all gone, and the co. has now an over-
draft of £14,000, and owes a big amount for stores
besides. A proposal for raising - £lO,OOO to carry out
certain development work recommended by Feldtman
was submitted by the chairman, but did not meet with
much support at the shareholders’ meeting in London.
A committee, however, was appointed to go into the
m tter, and meantime Bewick, Moreing and Go. are
checking Feldtman’s work. To make matters worse, the
directors are at loggerheads with the late managing
director, A. E. Morgans, with regard to some alleged
financial obligations. In - any case, if the overdraft is to
be wiped off, other debts paid, and the mine properly
exploited at depth, much more than £lO,OOO will be
required, otherwise the co. will soon be on the rocks
again.

Westralian Minister for Mines Gregory has
returned from his Nor’-West jaunt, “ much impressed,”
as the Perth papers put it, “ with the potentialities of
the mining fields.” Surprise is expressed by the Minister
that the discovery from time to time of so many rich
surface shows in the locality visited has not led to deep
sinking. Perhaps the report of the State Mining En-
gineer, who accompanied him on the tour, will explain
this. It may be that the shoots cut out in shallow
ground.

Fraser’s, Southern Cross (W.A.), has been
sampled and found wanting by Bewick, Moreing and Co.
There is a big body of stone in this mine which it is
alleged would crush better than it assays. At any rate, it
would have to do that to give a profit on the big outlay
necessary to equip and work the property. It is
nevertheless said that before leaving for London G. P.
Doolette offered to spend money in testing Fraser’s to a
depth of 1000 ft. to 1500 ft. if the Government would sub.
sidise the boring.

“ A.M.” : That “ old correspondent ” (B.
16/5/’O7), who wrote about gold stealing at Barrambie
(W.A.), must have grown up on “ Aboriginalities.” The
only gold-stealing case that ever originated in Barrambie
was a fiasco. The accused was discharged, and the
magistrate said he was sorry he could not allow the
accused costs. Neither have the police chased anyone
out of the district, as the “old correspondent” states.
The gold in the Barrambie Ranges is certainly in dabs,
but these dabs are in shoots, and these shoots are being
worked for all they are worth. So strenuously are these
shoots pursued that the co. has even put in a level 16ft.
from the surface, where there was a good run of gold.

Berry Extended, Creswick (Vic.), having
proved that its northern ground is disturbed and affected
by the old hydro-thermal that has worried Spring Hill
Leads for so long, wants to get away south. Here there
is a block of ground standing between the old Berry No.
1 mine workings and the faces of the Extended drives.
Miners in the district have a very lively recollection of
the frightful Australasian disaster, where the old workings
of the adjoining mine were struck, and a number of men
were drowned like rats in a hole. Hence their disinclina-
tion to take risks south in the direction of the Berry No. 1
ground. Surveyors have said that 1200 ft. separates tl e
faces of the two sets of workings, and that there can be
no danger until the Extended gets to Within 400 ft. of the
Berry No. 1 mine. But the miners know how easy it is
to go just a few feet too far. The whole point is that
there is uncertaintj' about the old surveys. Had the
Mines Department been up-to-date and compelled every
mining co. not only to keep plans, but to have them
verified by the mining inspectors of the district, the risk
would be as little as it is at the Long Tunnel, where the
water is being drawn off from the north-west ground into
the Extended mine without difficulty.

The New JNormanby, at Ballarat East, close by
the North Woah Hawp, is a claim where the royalty evil
is as pronounced as it is at the Star of the East, on the
Plateau ; but the Star’s case has been much more talked
about, simply because that harassed co. had a chance of
getting rid of its trouble. At the New Normanby the
curse is double-barrelled. First the royalty-squeezer
squeezes the co. ; then the co. squeezes the tributor.
The latter, for the most part, gets a horribly cold
time: you can tell that by the fact that last half-year
the co. had to allow its tributors “ subsist ” to the extent
of £1352, or about a quarter of the total wages paid
straight out- On the whole the sweating of the tributor
is worse than the sweating of the co. by the royalty-
grabber. That the New Normanby has paid £17,000 to
the latter is not at all according to Cocker, but it is still
worse that a co. with a big share register should carry on
under the tributing system. Yet the worst contract of
all at Ballarat is that by which cos. have bound them-
selves to crush at certain batteries. In that way the
charges have had to be met which would have covered
the cost of a new battery over and over again.

One of Victoria’s deserted goldfields is situated
between Walhalla and Woods Point, where one time the
Toombon mine kept a township humming - . The Toombon
closed down in 1897, although in its last four years it
yielded over 11,0000 z., from about 14,000 tons. The
country thereabouts was then too difficult to work at a
profit if the stuff went under an ounce ; but conditions
are now a bit more favorable, so operations on the line
may start again. The Toombon is the deepest mine in
Gippsland, except the Long Tunnel group at Walhalla.
Its bottom level is below 1000 ft. At the Woods Point
end the deepest workings are at 300 ft. ; at Walhalla they
get to about 3000 ft. Well-defined reefs run along the
country, which should repay prospecting by well-equipped
companies. Strange to say, Government Geologist Dunn,
whose skimpy reports seem to call for inquiry, says
nothing about the wealth extracted from the Toombon in
his handbook, which isn’t as valuable to prospectors as it
ought to be.

The Junction, one of the Gippsland dredging
pioneers—it works on the Ovens and Buckland rivers—
was a good while striking form ; and the first co., formed
about seven years ago, paid only one poor little “three-
penny.” But in Gippsland they found out many
things about dredging, and the present co., formed in
1903, has already paid 21s. 3d. per share in divs. As the

contributing' shares are only 18s. 9d. paid, the claim has
already more than given back the co.’s capital, and there
is still nearly three times as much ground in front as
there is at the back. Last half-year the profit ran to
£l9Ol (two dredges working) ; but, as some freehold had
to be paid for, only £lOOO (2s. per share) was divided.
Things should be better this current half-year, for there
isn’t any extraordinary expenditure in view.

The Electro-Hydraulic Co., Carngham (Vic.),
is not living up to the gaudy reports which led investors
into it. The half-yearly accounts show that £999 worth
of gold was won at a cost of £2221. Actual nozzle work
was begun on the face of wash on Feb. 12, and was inter-
mittently carried on until March 15, the cleaning-up of
the first paddock of half-an-acre resulting in a yield of
140 oz. Bdwt. On April 26, a rough clean-up yielded 103joz.
from half-an-acre, making a total of 2440 z. f '»‘i an apre
of ground, averaging 9ft. in depth. Since tka.. jcl :..n-up
no sluicing has been done, but two barges are now about
to start operations, and the next report- should tell
whether the ground is dividend-paying:
A grave which was being lijig in the Ballarat
cemetery for a mining investor disclosed some quartz
which went l|oz. to the ton; and the luck of T.'C.
Thomas, deceased, being proverbial) his live friends have
pegged out all the cemetery and a mile or two of the
country northward. The discovery 'H’lpft along" the
scheme to prospect Ballarat North, which was hanging
fire. Years ago the Cemetery Reef Co., a chain or two
away from “ the golden grave,” got rich returns, but the
water difficulty stopped it. It was T. C. Thomas,
deceased, who discovered the wonderful shoot of gold in
the Egerton mine, which paid nearly half a million in
dividends.

The yield of 170 oz. from 730 tons from the Souljff
Star, Ballarat, is not so encouraging as the fact that
lode, believed to be the Consols, has been struck at thV*
8100 ft. level. Shareholders are led to expect that a shoot
of gold—the Consols lode was rich, but patchy—will be
met in about 30ft. of driving. If so, the local supersti-
tion that an ounce of gold on the Plateau is worth two
ounces elsewhere will have a show to justify itself.

Ajax, of Daylosford (Vic.), is tottering at last
in open view, and it has no friends to prop it up. The
warning given months hack not to risk hard cash in the
mine lias been justified to the letter. (1) There is not a
mine in Victoria save the Long Tunnel Extended, which
of recent years has maintained an ounce average. (2)
Daylesford is notoriously patchy. (3) There was not
enough stone proved in the Ajax to justify share values.
To these three reasons then given a fourth is now added,
in the statement made by chairman Buchanan. Taking
the mine as it stands, it is a lOdwt. proposition. Thus, in
one little go, diva, are cut from 2s. to Is., with a prospect of
further tapering unless the rich shoot developed at 300 ft.
is met with. Sniping and pom-pom firing is going on in
an unceasing rattle at the management because no warning
was given that the ore values were on the down-grade.
The Aaous calls for sampling; the Aon for vitriol. No
one seems to ask for the share register. ’Tis said on behalf
of the directors that they have hung on to scrip all through.
Let this be established, and any attack on them will wilt
away like Jonah’s pumpkin plant did before the noontide
Bun. Since the Glenfine South fizzle from £l2 down to
nothing, there have been few such dramatic falls in gold
stocks as that of Ajax. The irony of the position is that
not long since a special meeting was called to increase
the directors’ fees. There is talk of another meeting to
reduce them, but with the Board holding its scrip this
would be impossible—unless they consented to the change.
* * * *
Three-quarters of a column of leaded stuff has
been poured out of the one-eyed Argus to advocate mine
sampling. It is very nice to talk that way from the office
chair because gold cuts out in the Ajax ; but let this par-
ticular press Tailor of Tooley-street answer the Stock Ex-
change inquiry: “ How is it that the Barrambie Range has
not panned out the 3oz. dirt that the sampling showed?”
Assays used to be given weekly, but they haven’t been
verified by the battery. So the Stock Exchange, Mel-
bourne, plants its hoof on Barrambie Ranges, believing
in the sampling sufficiently to say that it is good enough to
sell every time good assay values are sent. More rows than
occurat an Irish fair have disturbed Westralian mining over
this same sampling racket. Sutherland, B. M. and Co.,
Maokinnon and a dozen others have crossed swords, but
no one is yet satisfied that sampling will do more than
show the approximate. Even then it needs great care
and special training. So that, even if the Ajax had been
sampled, results would have depended on the man who
did it.

An end has to be recorded of the memorable
Guiding Star tribute, at Ballarat, which has gone on for
over 20 years. All the Guiding Star shares have been
garnered into the Star of the East fold, so that no fight
was needed to determine the royalty. The next move
will be the transfer of the lease to the Star of the East
and the South Star. Not a day too soon.

The flag of Erin waves languidly above the
tunnel mouth of the New Dempsey mine, Gaffney’s (Vic.);
but, in spite of the languor, there is a tread-on-me-if-you-
dare placard at the foot of the flagpole. There is no
need for this aggressive attitude, however, as jobbers
have measured up the strength of the New Dempsey
crowd, and don’t seek unnecessary risks. What has hap-
pened to the New Dempsey is just what has befallen all
Gaffney shows. Where the quartz hits the diorite dyke,
and conditions have been favorable, there exists a floor of
rich gold-bearing stone. Below, it wa- poor quartz;
above, not much better; and what is worse, there
wasn’t too much of it. A.I. had the same experience, close
by. Now the New Dempsey is having a shot at a shoot
of stone in a shaft somewhere near Gaffney’s Creek, and
with the vein tending towards the dyke. The induce-
ment to work here was some story of" good gold got by
old-time miners. A shoot has been found, but it is short
at 200 ft., and there isn’t much reason to believe that it
will lengthen at 300 ft. in the harder country to be opened
up.
Chalk’s No. 3, Maryborough (Vic.), is having
trouble with the ground at No. 1 shaft. Difficulty No. 1
is to keep the drives open until the wash can be got out.
No. 2 difficulty is to get wash of a grade that will pay.
The run of gold appears to be narrow ; but, if this ‘is
a fact, it is not officially stated. When a big field
of wash has to be opened up to strike only
a narrow streak of gold-bearing alluvial, there must be
trouble. The wise manager then decides to let the bulk
of the ground go, and pick out the choice spots. This is
what Rickards is doing, although it means really the
abandonment of a fairly big section of the gutter that
ought to have brought in fair returns. Chalk’s 3 has a
good deal of glacial conglomerate, and it always has been
a matter of doubt whether transported gold would be
carried on to it by the ancient rivers. The co. now will
have to put more dependence on No. 2 shaft. Yields
thence do not seem to promise divs., though, till more
ground is drained. However, the co. has put a feather
in its cap by paying off the last £lOOO of its debt to the
Government.

The much-reconstructed Chillagoe Co. (Q.)
finished its second year on March 31 —that is to say the
very newest co. did so. In the first year, there was a
profit of £10.498, of which £9965 was written off leaving
a balance of £633. In the past year, the profit ran to
£55,151, of which £49.051 has been written off leaving

The Chillagoe working account Tor the year
shows a balance of £84,449, which apparently may be cut
up in this way :
Balance from Railway £61,153
~ ~ Mines and Works.. .. 23,296
Total £84,449
Against this, management expenses, interest, arid depre-
ciation have to be charged. The operations can be
divided into two sections —those dealing with copper and
those dealing with silver-lead ores. Of a total of 29,868
tons of copoer ore handled, Chillagoe itself supplied
17,620 ; of the silver-lead ores, Chillagoe supplied only
564 tons of a total of 14,452 tons. But though
Chillagoe mines supplied 61 per cent, of the copper ores,
they only supplied 42 per cent, of the copper ; and the
proportion of Chillagoe lead and silver was very small.
About 27,000 tons of Mungana and other outside ore were
handled altogether, and there is no doubt that it was
from that that the bulk of the £23,296, working account
balance, came from. Yet the co.’s own “mining pro-
. parties, railway concessions, water rights, etc.” —in short,
mining properties and paper assets—are still in the books
at £315,363, or within a few thousands of the amount of
the paid capital. Practically everything depends upon
the railway and the custom works ; and they have to
carry a deadweight of over £300,000. If they can’t carry
it in addition to their own interest, then the shareholders
can get nothing.
The Chillagoe Co.’s railways are, therefore, the
main factor; and, so far as they have gone, this is their
recent history:—

An attempt was made to jig the Hampden (Q.)
market, last week, by publishing widely the fact that
the Baillieu and Tolhurst firms had completed the pur-
chase of the 85,000 reserve shares at £l. The truth, of
cpurse, was that the firms couldn’t do anything else but
carry out a bargain they made long ago. On the strength
of the reports, however, the shares, which no later than
March last were sold at 295., but then smashed down to
125., struggled up to 14s. Unfortunately at that
moment, Queensland Government Geologist Ball’s report
on the mine was published in the department’s Journal,
and it was obvious that Ball couldn’t see the vast ore-
supplies upon which the market had previously been
boomed. So quotations promptly sank back exhausted
after a very little spurt.

For the past three half-years the record of the
Stannary Dills (N.Q.)has been as follows :
Written-

Profit.
Sept., 1906 14,850 Nil 20,906
Mar., 1907 23,783 £2878
So the accounts are now square. But, as nothing has
been written off for wear and tear for a long while past,
as far as can be traced, a good deal of revenue will for
some time to come have to be turned that way—or, at
least, it ought to be turned that way.

Bewick, Moreing and Co. let things go along
at Mt. Oannindah (Q.) without interference for some time
after they had secured their big block of shares, but
they have now made a move, and things are to alter.
Young Philp, full of enthusiasm, really had a bigger and
tougher job than his little practical experience qualified
him to tackle ; and shareholders have been growing
uneasy. He got costs down, it is said, to under 10s. per
ton ; and yet, though he reported 3 per cent, ore, there
were no visible profits. Changes are therefore pending.
8., M. and Co. will put in somebody as general manager,
and Philp becomes me.allurgist. Meantime people are
turning up Dr. Jack’s report of some weeks ago, and
noting the concents; and now that they have bought their
shares (most of them at about 55.; present price, a shade
over 45.), they are wondering whether l)r. Logan Jack isn’t
an incurable optimist. Anyway, it is hard to find a trace
of a report of his in which lie couldn’t find something
cheerful to say about prospects. The least cheerful re-
port available is, perhaps, that on the South Oannindah
leases, in which the Corries, of Brisbane, have the
longest finger ; even Dr. Jack couldn’t find much good
to say about them, except the Apple Tree.

Metallurgist Alan Gibb, whose hand is in many
new Queensland copper enterprises, left for London 10
days or so ago, partly to give a much-needed lift to the
copper section in which he is interested ; and Thomas
Gibb—who retains his good name through all the vicissi-
tudes of mining—has taken up the job of managing
director of Cannindah in the younger Gibb’s absence.
For the present, however, he is up at Glassford Creek,
struggling once more with the metallurgical problem
there. Latest report is that he has solved it. In that
case Glassford only needs an ore supply to make a mine.

Queensland gold-mining dividends for May got
right away down to £9529, as against £26,CJO for May,
1906; but until recently Mount Morgan was dividing
monthly, and that made a difference of £12,600. The
gold yield, too, has misbehaved like this: —May, 1905
£211,915; 1906, £206,270 ; 1907, £176,676. But for Mount
Morgan things would show up worse even than that:
this one wonder-mine is now turning out well over one-
fourth of the whole of the State’s gold, and yet in some
lists it is made to figure now not as a gold mine but as a
copper mine.

There are two opinions at Charters Towers
about Kelly’s Queen Block, and the market reflects the
uncertainty. People who pin their faith to a big area
would never touch it, because it has only 8J acres ; yet
£196,600 has been paid in divs. A mining co. that can
pay that much and not create a reserve fund cannot
claim sympathy when hard times come. The show has
now seen its best days, but it isn’t quite done with yet.
The finding of heavy mineral stone at 1316 ft. vertical
raised people’s hopes, but the reef gets rather narrow in
places, and mineral stone is notoriously patchy. All the
same, the crushings have been good: the last lot returned
over £4 per ton ; but for a patchy mine with so small an
area the swag of shares is excessive. It has had a way,
though, of getting out of tight corners, as all patchy
mines have ; but if it keeps paying away all its profits, it
will need all its old luck.

“ Quartpot,” from Cloncurry : Developments
on the field generally are poor. Queensland Exploration
at 100 ft. has crosscut a lode, variously described as 13ft.
wide, worth 4 per cent., and 18ft. wide, worth 5 per cent,
of mixed sulphides. Neither compares favorably with
the 24 per cent, stuff smelted from surface ores by the
co. some years back. Hampden, with its rich patches
of surface ore, has about 3ft. of 4 per cent, sulphide
principally iron pyrites, at 100 ft. Duchess has three or
four shoots of rich ore extending over some 600 ft. in
length, and averaging about 3ft. thick, and is shipping
a lot of good stuff ; but in the deepest ground the body
is showing a tendency to narrow. This mine would have
been a good thing for a small co., but it cannot carry
such a load as the Hampden. Mount Hope is a purelv
speculative show. There is an enormous irregular
outcrop of quartz stained with carbonates, and
carrying small bunches of ore when sunk on, but
nothing payable so far. At a distance it looks
like the ruins of an ancient town ; and were quartz the
article required it would be a valuable mine. At Duck
Creek the VVillcocks Co. is erecting a water-jacket, but,
with all its leases, has not enough ore in sight to keep it
going ; while at the Gorge, although Allis’ reverberatory is
completed, it is idle, and ore is being carted to it some
60 miles, from the Trikolana, on the Wills. Yet Duck
Creek is only 10 miles distant. One bright spot on the
field is Mt. Elliott; yet even this is not too promising at
bottom. Still, there is a large value developed, and a
couple of years’ good work is assured for the furnace.
As for the proposed Government smelters (one at Clon-
curry and one at Townsville), on present appearances
there is no hope of keeping them employed. One small
smelter at Townsville, with the aid of Cloncurry and
other districts, might pay its way ; but when the fact is
taken into consideration that, with copper at over £lOO,
only a little over 100 tons of ore per month is leaving the
field, what sort of chance does it look like ? Seeing the
immense area over which copper is scattered, it is not to
be supposed, however, that there will not be some mines.
But the knock which the booming: of such shows as
Hampden will give the place will prevent people touching
it when the mines, are found.

“Mainshaft”: “Redoubt”remarks(B.2o/6/’07):
“ Bull had his feed of Oloncurry copper from seven to 30
years ago, and from the inception of the present metal
boom he has been feeding his calves, of which Australia
has been the most avaricious.” I don’t know what an
avaricious calf is, but “ Redoubt’s ” statements are non-
sense. As instance, the principal English-Australian
Oloncurry cos. operating are Elliott, Hampden, McGregor.
All these were vendored by Australians, and London put
the prices up. No doubt about that. Queensland Ex-
ploration Co. has sold a few thousand shares to Aus-
tralia, but seven-eighi.hs of the dealings in Oloncurry
stock have been in Elliotts, Ilanipd. ns and McGregors.
So many Elliotts have been bought on London account
that the office and direction of operations has been
removed to London (more’s the pity). If many Aus-
tralians have bought Elliotts, Hampdens aud McGregors
at high prices, they have, with the Londoners, bought
the stock from other Australians. This consolation is
presented to anybody who fell in. As to “Quartpot”
(B. 20/6/’O7), he has apparently been drinking out of
himself. His description of Argylla is utterly misleading.
The “co." never had a “late and sanguine general
manager,” and he never started to sink anything. The
co. (the Queensland Copper Freeholds, Ltd.) was only
formed last February to take over Argylla and six other
freeholds. The Just-in-Time freehold is a good show ;
but that doesn’t disprove the facts of the great size and
richness of the Argylla superficially. And there are no
developments to disprove the superficial facts either.

But for its carbonates —which are patchy and
precarious, and confined to the upper levels—the position
of Block 14, Broken Hill, would be getting desperate. Not
only are the results of prospecting below 600 ft. most dis-
appointing (to those, anyhow, who had expectations that
a profitable mine would be found there), but the sulphide
supplies in the workings above 600 ft. are poorer in both
quantity and quality. Meantime, the carbonates are
being rooted out greedily to catch the market, and the
management makes the usual complaint of scarcity of
good miners. No doubt the cos. would put on more men
if they could get them ; but on the inevitable weakening
of the lead market, the chances are that about one-half of
even those who are at present engaged will be given their
walking ticket.

The long-drawn-out fight over the control of
the Junction North, Broken Hill, is very near its end.
The London office —which was useless “ frill ” all along—
is to be shut up, and an office opened in Sydney instead ;
and the Melbourne Board is to be cut down to two
directors.

Maoriland has been getting a sample of the
Yankee method of share-pushing: a Christchurch broking
firm has bombarded it with pamphlets whose covers
screech such remarks as “ Copper is the main pillar of
this electrical age,” “ The world wants all the copper it
can get,” “ No other investment provides the safety and
profit found in copper.” The pamphlets and circulars
consist mostly of garish figures concerning the Calumet
and Hecla, Rio Tinto, and other copper-mining marvels—
the Calumet and Hecla has paid over £10,000,000
in divs., and last year the Rio Tinto paid 110 per
cent, in divs. But what has it all got to do with the
Maoriland Copper Co., Ltd., some of whose 100,000
shares the “pushers” want to get rid of at 165.?
The co. holds 2000 acres near Nelson, including the
United, Champion, Monster and other alleged mines,
about which, from time to time for very many years past,
the most remarkable yarns have been told. Alleged
estimates of ore reserves have been made, running into
tens of thousands of tons, and plans have been prepared
to support the estimates. The fact, however, is that the
ore occurs at or near the contact of the crushed serpentine
and diorite, and is in the form of irregular lenses and
boulders, entirely unconnected with one another. But
because one lens or boulder has been found at one level or
tunnel, and another lens or boulder has been found at
another level, it has been assumed, without sinking
winzes, that the ore is continuous between the tw’o, and on
that remarkable assumption these estimates appear to
have been formed. There is an old smelting furnace on
the property, but it has not been worked for years ; and
there is not on surface or exposed anything like enough
to justify anyone in starting it now. if the mines had a
copper lode, the hifalutin about the future of the nietal
would have some interest for the co. But it hasn’t. No
doubt prospecting will disclose numerous lenses ; but
whether they can be worked with any profit whatever is
another matter.

“Shareholder”: Wild Cat is misinformed
when it says it takes 6000 tons at Bischoff (Tas.) to
provide a quarterly ss. Divs. have so far been kept up
to ss. per month ; for the half-year to January, 44,893
tons were crushed and £27,000 divided (it takes £3OOO to
pay a ss. div.). The distribution then was thus at the
rate of about 5000 tons per ss. dividend ; and it has not
altered much from that. The old mine is far from worked
out; in fact, is not yet prospected. But the manage-
ment is antiquated and hopeless ; what is required is new
blood on the Directorate and new management. This we
are making a strong effort to obtain.
* * * *
Mt. Lyell (Tas.) has set its mark on the his-
tory of pyritic smelting by producing blister copper at
under £37 per ton, from ore that does not average 2 per
cent. About 53 tons of ore are smelted to produce a ton
of copper, and the profit made out of gold and silver ex-
tracted at foreign works reduces the cost of producing
electrolytic copper to £3llBs. 7d.—that is less than
per lb. Very few mines can undersell Mt. Lyell. The
Tennessee mine (U.S.A.) does mining, smelting, and con-
verting for 12s. 6d. per short ton ; the ore is low grade,
though, wherefore the cost of producing and realising on
fine copper runs up to 10'91 cents (say 5Jd.) per lb.
But Mt. Lyell has a very big share register. The produc-
tion is about 8000 tons, or 17,920,0001 b. per annum ; and
on 1,200,000 shares, that is less than 151 b. per share. With
copper at lOd. a pound (£93 6s. Bd. per ton), the profit
would be approximately 6sd. per lb. ; with copper at
£56, or 6d. a pound, it would mean a profit of 2§d. per lb.

A tale of the luck of mining was told in a North
Queensland Warden’s Court in Moffat and Alexandt r v.
Sheppard, the other day. Near the Vulcan (Ininebank)
mine is the Tornado, owned by Moffat and Alexander.
This was let on tribute to Sheppard some months ago,
but meeting with little success, he abandoned it. Then
another Sheppard, who is manager of the Vulcan, was
looking over the workings shortly after, and noticed tin
in one of the old pot-holes. He put on a man to open it
up, and a valuable body of ore was found. The tributor
remembered that his term wasn’t quite up, promptly
rushed in seventeen men, and worked the mine seven
days a week. Moffat and Alexander objected to the
number of men and the Sunday work, and took
the matter to the Warden’s Court. The Warden
decided against them re the number of men, but
ordered the stoppage of Sunday work. The tribute ex-
pires on June 22, by which time it is expected that
Sheppard will have raised £5OOO worth of ore. Mean-
time, John Moffat and his partner are wondering how
they didn’t see it themselves, since John Moffat alone is
supposed to know the Vulcan country better than any
two other men put together.

“Belele”: “Vag” (B. 6/6/’O7) says Mt.
Cleveland (Tas.) deepest level is 45ft. Wrong ! Deepest
level is 70ft. He sarcastically mentions that the lode is
reported to be 32ft. wide, but he says it rests on a cap of
rock which, unfortunately, is not tin stone. Wrong
again. The floor of the adit is soft gossan, assaying over
7 per cent, tin oxide ; from wall to wall, 34ft. It is the
same material as is showing in all the crosscuts and
trenches for over 20 chains in length. The floor of rock
he possibly struck was the manager, Hugh Dempster,
who has refused to fake the mine in the interest of several
large shareholders, who are bearing and buying the
scrip. Mt. Cleveland presents features which sug-
gest that it may turn out the richest tin discovery in
Tasmania since Bischoff. Floated into a syndicate
of 100 shares at £4 10s. in October last, the scrip
rapidly rose to £250. Provisional directors were
appointed to form a co. of 75,000 shares at £1 (10 000 re-
serve ; 15,000 contributing, paid up to 2s. cash and p.n.
for balance). All those offered were taken up by original
holders in four days, and the same people mainly hold
the shares to-day, refusing to sell at 20s.
A new improved drill maker and sharpener is
superseding the somewhat expensive method of sharpen-
ing drills by hand. The machine will be welcomed by all
mining cos. .because the men are able to sharpen up to
about 140 drills an hour without trouble, consequently
increasing the output and reducing the cost, which secures
to the miAes substantial benefit. These machines have
been supplied to leading mines everywhere by the makers,
Messrs. Word Bros., of San Francisco, who have ap-
pointed W. & J. Lempriere, of Melbourne and Sydney, the
sole Australian agents. The machine has the distinction:
of being a drill maker as well as drill sharpener .*

Motto for Carruthers : “Nothing secedes

Anti-Sosh leading articles may be sum-
marised as platitude in convulsions.
N.S.W. Labor party has, so far, put into
the field 58 candidates for the State elections.

It has been only since the headquarters of
the Meteorological Bureau were established in
Melbourne that Sydney has had such miserable
sloppy weather. Awake, New South Wails !
Premier Carruthers is still busy discover-
ing Newcastle —for which Newcastle probably has
to thank the ricketty tenure on which Carruthers’
honorary Minister and understudy, W. T. Dick,
holds his Newcastle seat.
According to William Lyne, he is the
Minister in charge of the mail contract negoti-
ations, and he won’t assent to any scheme by
which one State can get an un-Federal advantage
of the others ; and Lyne is quite right in that.
In 1907, as compared with 1906, the in-
crease of shipping at Sydney was 80 per cent, of
steamers and 37 per cent, of sailers. It’s things
like that which show how the curse of Federation
works against the unhappy Ma State.
Two grateful Queensland occurrences on

the pearling industry.
A Noumea paper records an offer made

heard of that £60,000,000.

It is time the Senate reconsidered itself as

Under closer settlement the same land supports
1500 of a farming population and 800 people in the

90,000 acres of about equally good land, but the
owners will not lease except at exorbitant rentals.
A progressive land-tax is the cure.
The Bulletin does not believe in import-

Bankruptcy Law the Commonwealth couldn’t do
much better than take the British law as a model,

It is, on the whole, more complete than any of the
existing State laws, and a similarity of commercial
law between different parts of the Empire is
desirable when possible.

In S. Australia they don’t nowadays look
to see whether a man has corns on his hands before
they choose him as a Parliamentary Labor candi-
date. Among the 10 new men just chosen there is a
solicitor, an auctioneer, a grazier, an accountant,
and a builder. A couple of laborers, a baker, and
two other tradesmen make up the list. There is
no better proof that the Labor party no longer
stands for a class. It represents opinions now.
The Federal Crown Solicitor “is consider-
ing the advisability of proceeding against four or
five Federal candidates” who have failed to for-
ward their electoral expenditure returns. Why
the “consideration ” ? That’s the law, passed to
eliminate the weight of Fat as an electoral factor,
and, if it isn’t to be a dead letter, transgressors
should be called upon like any other lawbreaker.

the Deformers adopted reduction, and Lee one
evening sat down and ate up all he had said
against it. Now Reform calls for a further re-
duction, and Solemn Lee is going to accept that
too, and eat up things again.
Extract from the foreign-trade Hobart
Mercury’s English wool-sales letter :
It was pre-eminently a Bradford sale, the wool being
hardly good enough for America.
The wool wasn’t good enough for the looms of the
Protectionist country ; so England, home of
Freetrade and Shoddy, sucked it up. They used
to hold up Freetrade as the policy of cheapness.
Now they admit that it is merely the policy of the
cheap and nasty.
In the case of N.S.W. Chief Railway
Commissioner Johnson, the glad hand of the
Sydney morning papers has been definitely ex-
changed for the cold shoulder. Johnson isn’t
half so liberal as Oliver in the matter of starving-
stock rates —he thinks 25 per cent, reduction
sufficient where Oliver gave 75 per cent. Also he
isn’t nearly so patient as Oliver —Oliver was often
too patient—with buzzing little suburban deputa-
tions. And there is no visible improvement in
the management.
S.M. Herald (13/6/’O7) finds the Aus-
tralian Labor party “ not guilty” :
Throughout the existence of the Commonwealth—
with the short interval of the Reid Administration—the
Labor party has been in power. It dictated terms to the
Barton Ministry, just as it now dictates terms to the
Deakin Ministry. But it never advocated repudiation,
and that not only because it knew that such advocacy
would alienate sympathy in every quarter, hut because
its members, without exception, were opposed to any
unfair dealing with the public creditor.
The recent conference of country members
of Bent’s Parliament was a cluster of leeches.
They were dissatisfied with the Water Act valua-
tions, and wished to revert to the old, inadequate
municipal valuations; the railway freights and
fares were too high, and inimical to country
interests ; the proposed reclassification of grazing
area leases was iniquitous ; the valuations and
rating of unused roads and water frontages were
disgracefully high, and should be brought down
to nothing or thereabouts forthwith.
A significant feature of the Queensland
electoral campaign was the cold-shouldering
which the Licensed Vic-
tuallers’ Association received
from all parties. At an
early stage this body voted
£l5O for political purposes.
The L.V.A. seems to have
taken it for granted that
the Philp party would, as
of yore, eagerly welcome
the help of “ the Trade.”
But Philp assumed the
attitude of a Pharaoh
who knew not the
bottled Joseph. For
since the last State
elections anew power,
the Woman’s Vote,
had arisen. So when
Bung, with all the
assured exuberance of an
ancient ally, rushed to
the assistance of Philp,
the Hon. Bob, instead of
-taking him to his heart,
coldly held out one finger to
be shaken. Kidston, in his turn,
was cannily non-committal when the rebuffed
Licensed Victuallers’ came sidling up to him ; and
the Bowman wing of the Labor party talked
heresy about a State monopoly of the Liquor
traffic.
Amusing to read Joey Carruthers’s lauda-
tion of Brisbane and Melbourne to the detriment
of Sydney in respect to city beautification, when
it is remembered that Joseph has steadfastly re-
fused to assist the Sydney City Council in any
way. Hefoughttooth and nail against the widening
of Lower George-street to 99ft., and is, at the
present moment, proposing to sell portions of the
Rocks area, which will be practically the key to
the new entrance to the city when the North
Shore Bridge is built.
Some men never know when to leave bad
alone. Anti-Sosh was a horrible failure as a
bogey last Federal election, yet Westralia’s Pub-
lic YVorks Minister, James Price, tells Fremantle
that he is going to make Anti-Sosh his war-cry for
next election. (Price runs a laundry, and the
washerman’s war-cry is naturally very fierce.)
But unfortunately for Price, he has made Fre-
mantle want a Government Graving Dock more
than almost anything else on earth at present.
He has barracked for it, and was returned last
year on his solemn promise to get it; and Fre-
mantle knows it can’t have both Anti-Socialism
and a Socialistic graving dock. So the chances
are that it will take the dock and turn Price into
a minus quantity so far as next Parliament is
concerned. Or Price may begin to see that his
bogey is loaded, and drop it.
EXPLOITING THE STATE AGAIN
Mr. Carruthers regards the intention of the Commonwealth to take over the State debts as another scandalous
interference with State rights on the part of the “Robber in Chief.”
CARRUTHERS: “ What , deprive my poor old cow of her ticks, and leave her quite desolate ?
Well, you are an unconscionable devil !”
One of Joe Carruthers’ reasons for shirking
the reduction of members in the State Parliament
is that some Federal members —names not fur-
nished —are crying out for the abolition of the
State Legislatures, and he will need the assistance
of quite 90 members in order to struggle against
them. When he was clutching at this straw of
excuse, it might have occurred to Joseph that the
N.S.W. electors would be more likely to stick up
for their local House if it were run on a more
economical and reasonable basis, and more especi-
ally if the Upper House were reformed out of
existence.
A N.S.W. railway terminates at Mur-
willumbah, on the Tweed River. The Queensland
Government certainly understood when it extended
its railway to the Tweed Heads, about 20 miles from
Murwillumbah, that N.S.W. would join on to the
Queensland line. But Joseph wouldn’t dream of
that, because he believes that everything in
N.S.W. should come to Sydney. Sydney is 400
miles away, necessitating a sea trip. The capital
of Queensland is only 70 miles from the Tweed by
rail. The N.S.W. Government apparently says
to the North Coast man: “If you do not come
to Sydney to do your business you needn’t do
any business.”
“ C.N.” : Ran across a man who is going
to write to the Telegraph about this
cursed Federation. I found him in the
cupboard of a slot-telephone at a suburban
post office on Sunday afternoon, when I
turned up for my own penn’orth. While
I stood on the kerb, he studied the direc-
tions for a full 10 minutes, then solemnly
drew out a penny, and, dropping it in the
slot, rang up. I heard him give a number,
then cry in anguish—“ Why, I put the
coin in already.” There was a one-sided
dialogue, in which he used a quantity of
bad language. After that he searched his
pockets, and finally emerged to ask me if
I had change of a shilling. I hadn’t.
Whereupon he said that he would have to
go into the city, and this trouble would
never have occurred in the old days.
When I pointed out that the directions
he had spent so long reading told him in
big letters not to put in the coin until he
received instructions from the operator, he
said it was all due to this blasted Federa-
tion, anyhow, and he’d show it up in the
D.T. I retorted that it was only since
Federation that people had any penny-slot
telephones at all. Then he nearly burst
with passion, and strode off, saying I must
be another of those damned Victorians.
He added that I looked like one.
It was five years on June 3rd since
Iceberg Irvine threw Peacock out of the
Victorian Premiership, and of the 87 mem-
bers who voted on his motion, only 41 are
still in the House. A few of the missing
46 are dead, a few more have gone into
Federal politics; but most have just been
dropped and forgotten. Peacock, however, is
back again at his old post of Chief Secretary—
like the Chow who takes toll from friend and foe
alike, and smiles always.
The Colonial Sugar Refining Co. seems to
be looking for trouble. Just when there were
grave doubts whether the huge profits which it
squeezes out of the growers on the one side and
the public on the other are not a menace to the
White Australia policy, it watered its capital so
as to make still harder squeezing, in order to ex-
tract still bigger profits, almost a certainty. Now,
having bought out practically the only little bit of
competition it had —the Poolman refineries in
Melbourne and Sydney—it promptly bumps up
its selling rates for sugar, in spite of a large carry-
over from last season and the certainty of a very
big harvest this season. It seems to be inviting
the Commonwealth to “come on.” And the
infant Commonwealth is getting strong on its
legs, and may come on rather suddenly.
Apropos the Sydney Telegraph’s scare
that the Northern Territory is too full of malaria
for white man’s occupation, some recent remarks
of Dr. Ham, Queensland’s public health officer,
are interesting. The country north of Rock-
hampton, much of which has a heavier tropical
rainfall than the Territory, ought to reek with
the diseases that are relied upon to scare the
Commonwealth off a White Australia policy for
the North ; yet when Dr. Ham was asked about
the proposal to establish an institute where
tropical diseases might be studied, he said that
“ the Department had found it extremely difficult
to get material from the North in connection with
the earth-eating disease, malaria, and other dis-
orders. He failed to see how this material was
to be collected. The proper place to study tropical
medicine was in the field where tropical diseases
exist.”
Australia has its fair share of those most
miserable of human beings—the chronic dyspeptic.
Angier’s Emulsion works wonders in many forms
of dyspepsia. It has cured many obscure cases
that have baffled other treatment. It is soothing,
healing, strengthening, and pleasant to take. In
hree sizes, of all chemists.*
One Blacklow, lately Clerk of Courts at
Williamstown (Vic.), has been sent to a back-
blocks post for his indiscretion in hurling
Conservative gibes at the Factories Act from
his official perch in Court. It now remains
for the Government to fall savagely on the next
lot of J’s.P. who offend in the same way, and tear
four-and-forty of them. Punishment for contempt
of Court is not nearly so much called for as
penalties for contempt of law on the part of
biassed magistrates.
Kyogle (Richmond River, N.S.W.) is
badly in need of a gaol. Drunks and other un-
lawful persons are chained to any fallen tree that
may be handy; and sometimes it rains. Premier
Carruthers visited this village on his North Coast
trip, and it was proposed to approach him on the
subject of getting a courthouse and gaol. But
the great statesman heard of the intended
request, and in his first speech he told the crowd
that “their manly, honest faces convinced him
that such a degrading structure as a gaol would
never be seen in their town.” The teat-pulling
Simple Simons were so flattered that they hadn’t
the heart to put their little request, and went
contentedly home to empty the cow. The drunk
still leads the simple open-air life.
JOHN BULL SIGNS THE (FREETRADE)
PLEDGE.
However, he could not shut his eyes to the position of
the British Government, returned with a record majority,
pledged, among other things, to a continuance of Free-
trade. —Premier Ward, of Maoriland
When the private syndicate cuts up a big
estate for settlement, the settler is beginning to
find out that he has to keep his eyes well skinned.
There was Kyogle (N.S.W.), for instance. That
syndicate made a fine haul, but it quite forgot to
make adequate provision for roads. Consequently,
after every shower, the tracks are bogs, and it
will take all the Shire Council’s means for years
to make them traffickable. It looks as though
Private Enterprise can’t even be trusted to sub-
divide a paddock.
Mr. Percy Crampton, Singleton, N.S.W.,
says:—•“ Not so long ago I was seized with a veiy
heavy cold. Having heard of the wonderful
qualities of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy I de-
cided to vice it atrial, and am glad 1 did, for
after taking two bottles I was completely cured.
I have much pleasure in testifying to the curative
qualities of Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy, and
can say from experience that it does all that the
makers claim it will do.”*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, June 25, 1907.
My Dear Arini,—
Rain in Sydney and rain in the hearts of the
shareholders of the Royal Grand Opera Co. The
co. opened here on May 24, and up to now
it has had 21 wet nights—Wagnerian rain, not
Chopinesque. Promoters of the enterprise
deserve respectful sympathy from all. And they
have it—but the popular sympathy doesn’t take
the form of coming out into the wet. Then there
have been five postponements—not that postpone-
ments are unexpected in grand opera. Twice
“The Flying Dutchman” has been on the
point of alighting on the boards of the
Royal, and twice he has tacked off (here the
metaphors mix) because the American prima
donna Anderson didn’t feel up to the fearfully
uppish part (in the matter of notes) of Senta.
Manager Musgrove came on to the stage on
Thursday night (occasion of the first postpone-
ment of the Flying Thing), and in a voice sugges-
tive of the Day of Wrath, explained that Madame
Anderson had that afternoon received news of the
death of her father, grandfather, and uncle in
America.
Wholesale tragedies like mighty rivers and
mammoth trusts —are so peculiar to America that
the audience wasn’t very surprised, but it was
very sympathetic. When the manager went on to
say that Miss Heinze would sing Elizabeth
in the substitution (“ Tannhauser ”), although she
had not sung it for four years, the audience
would have gone through a rain of lager for fair
Heinze’s sake before it would stream out
and demand back its money. As the woman
of quality, Elizabeth Heinze wore in the Hall
of Song scene a jewelled, white satin robe, with a
long moss-green velvet train, embroidered with
gold, from the shoulders, and the spiky crown
seen on statues of the Virgin. In opposition to
the part of the hussy Venus, robed in some neck-
laces and a lot of transparency, the dimpled and
beautiful as well as gladiatorial Heinze made a
splendid picture as she posed on the stairs of the
Hall, the tender green of her velvet train draping
the stairs six steps below.
Second postponement of “The Flying Dutch-
man ”on Saturday. Prima-donna Anderson still
grieving over the wholesale scything of the inno-
cents abroad. Sydney by now dubious over the
number of the death-roll. “ Lohengrin,” put on
at the last moment, gave little Miss Barckow, as
Elsa, a show. She did look a pet in her white
nighty outfit and her fair hair wide dispread over
her girlish shoulders. This Lohengrin, when he
has dismissed the Swan (in the lovely aria which
all the pounding throng in the audience knows so
well), and comes down stage, his digestive anatomy
eighteen inches in advance, looks as if he ought
to tell this Elsa that he’ll be a father, not a bride-
groom, to her. But he sings like a bridegroom
at times. When the Bridal Chorus is “ on,”
the pounding throng in the audience is
pleased, and leans forward to watch conductor
Slapoffski conduct their old friend. Also, it
wonders if there ever was a perfectly satisfactory
Lohengrin. A combination of Archangel Michael
and Julius Knight, endowed with a superb tenor
voice, would about fill the bill and break up
scores of happy homes. How the amorous,
clamorous female would pursue him, to be sure !
What a profile has Slapp! Something like
the face of an octopus. Mrs. Slapoffski is in
Sydney, and for such a musicianly person lying
very low. But she has a ten-months baby to
make concords and discords. Wonderful woman
Mrs. Slap. She can sing every leading female
operatic role, soprano, mezzo and contralto.
And sing ’em well too.
While on the subject of fat foreign operatic
singers : It was in New York, and the conductor
was giving a Gutrune (who falls fainting by the
bier of Siegfried and ought to be slim) rehearsal.
This Gutrune was a two-hundred-pound one.
Both she and the conductor lamented the second
hundred poundage. They were alone in the
opera-house, and he was suspected of being in
love with her. Suddenly he sprangat theladv. She
ducked and ran up-steps and down-steps ; through
the stalls and the dress-circle and through dress-
ing-rooms the villain still pursued her, and at the
height of the heroic flight and pursuit the mana-
ger entered. “ How dare you insult Miss
Gutrune by trying to kiss her?” thundered
the potentate. The conductor spoke the equi-
valent for “Rats,” and coolly explained that he
had no intention of kissing her. He was merely
exercising her to reduce her weight.
Miss Rawson lent a busy ear and an attentive
eye to the Grand Opera on Saturday night, but the
rain seemed to have diluted the spirits of the
audience to eighty per cent, under proof, and
there was an air of dismalness abroad. Riinger, as
Frederic, is a capital actor, and he worked like ten
Counts of Brabant to lift the gloom. Mayoress
of Sydney Hughes has floated along to several of
the grand operas, and her long pink osprey, worn
just the right distance from one optic, is greatly
admired —and imitated. Judge Heydon is so
constant an auditor that he is the first foot you
tread on going up the stairs .of the Royal. The
fine, full-blown widow Macnamara has also come
along with frequency, dressed in filmy black. The
pure blondes do show off, and are shown off, by
black wear. Her daughters, slender, swan-necked
girls, with white, sloping shoulders, and flaxen
heads, do something towards decorating the dress
circle. Miss Clara Manning, another decora-
tively blonde presence, was at the Swan drama
on Saturday night.
Miss Maggie Knight left Sydney on Friday,
to take up her part in “ The Breaking of the
Drought ” with the Bland Holt Co.
Miss Iris King, eldest daughter of Mr. Kelso
King, manager of the Mercantile Mutual Insurance
Co. is to be married to-morrow night (Wednesday)
to Mr. Harold Waring, son of the head of the
swell-furniture firm of Waring Bros, in London.
Bridegroom-elect arrived in the Mooltan. Brought
the bride a lot of diamond and emerald sparklers.
An eight o’clock p.m. wedding can be made a
more decorative function than a daylight coupling.
Evening dress and picture hatting will be the vogue
amongst the guests. Bride shows individuality
in her “I will” gown. It is of deep biscuit,
soft, thick satin. A long scarf of lace droops from
the back of the shoulders. It is cut low and has
short ball sleeves. The wreath is described as
being something extra-special in the way of
orange blossoms, and has a couple of wilted petals,
as if the sun had burnt ’em. Miss King has a
beautiful complexion, fair hair, and is short and
cuddlesomely plump. She will start out to get
used to her new name in a tailor-made of blue
cloth elaborately braided, and a tricorne white
felt hat with wings.
Bridesmaids have had irises done in enamel
given them by Him ; Iris being Her name. Her
sister is also horticulturally named. She’s an
Olive. These maids will, report says, wear some-
thing quite new in the line of head decorations
under the electrics at the Cathedral. An expert
has described it thusly : “ You take a long ostrich
plume, and strip the feathers from the spine. The
stripping is done so carefully that a film of the
cuticle, or skin of the rib (I don’t know the exact
word) adheres to the two feathery masses. These
two spineless plumes—O, don’t be silly ! Of
course the spine or rib is of no use to anybody—
are wired on to the narrowest of ribbon, and are
worn on the hair as a cascade falling at the back of
one ear. The loveliest cataract of fluff ! The ostrich
wreaths for this wedding will be tipped with
green, and fastened on to the hair with green
roses.”
A brace of the bride’s hats are said to repre-
sent the latest in artistic millinery. They are
“ Louise ” hats. One is the new-shaped Leghorn,
worn on the back of the head, and trailing down
over the back hair are three feathers, shading
from pale old rose to a dark raspberry. Second
achievement is one of the new shot-green and
navy straws turned sharply up and off the face,
with pink peaches and loops of ribbon, and going
down the drooping back of the hat are clusters of
grapes.
From an Indian paper :
An engagement is announced between Mr. Campbell
Cowley, eldest son of the Hon. Sir Alfred Cowley, of
Brisbane, and Miss Norah K. Fey, second daughter of
Capt. Fey, of Calcutta.
You needn’t call yourself a lady if you don’t
have one of the new umbrella veils. Those I saw
were quite 50 inches across. Absolutely circular.
The centre goes on to the centre of the crown of
the hat. They are mostly in white, and navy filet
net with silk frills, and they fallm flutes all around
your head and face. But thejilet net is no beauti-
fier in the sense of concealing lines or freckles.
From fifteen to twenty-five shillings does the price
of these veils range.
A new wing of the Naval House was un-
furled last Friday. His Ex. Rawson did the orna-
mental work (after he’d contributed a big cheque).
His Ex. Admiral Fawkes helped him in the
decorative scheme, and Mr. Alfred Milson
chivvied both Admirals about, and ran the
show to a successful and picturesque finale. As
hon. sec. for the N.H., Mr. Milson told “those
present ” some facts. When it was built in ’BB the
late millionaire Tyson gave £2OOO, and £9OOO was
raised by subscription. Then the hon. sec.’s chest
pouted as he announced that Mr. Hugh Dixson
had forwarded a cheque for £lOOO. Sensation !
Mr. Dangar sent along £6OO. There were other
subs., but not sensational. On a day of rain and
greyness, with interludes of drizzle, the outdoor
ceremony didn’t appeal to many of the smarter
sex. Mrs. and Miss Fairfax felt it a Duty to
come, and so did Mrs. Alfred Milson and Mrs.
Shearston. Husband of last named is a chaplain
and superintendent of the Institution.
Surgeon Adams, of the Pah’f’l, was married last
week to Miss Marjorie Knox, second daughter of
the E. W. Knoxes, of Bellevue Hill, so there
was the usual wreath hoisted on the big warship,
and the stereotyped arch of steel uplifted in the
church. Miss Rawson was present as a guest.
So unusual for her Excellencette to guest any-
where, that one has to specify. She is always
declaring things open or presiding at meetings for
the furtherance of something or other very dry
but useful.
Miss Portia Geach sends from Seville (the place
where Rossini’s famous Barber swaggered and
shaved) a postcard, showing a picture of an old
Moorish palace. Card is a guarantee of good
faith that the artist is doing the loaf beautiful in
J uanita Land.
The poor woman was getting along nicely after
the chloroform when her husband inquired of the
sister of the ward whether he might see the
patient. “ Not yet awhile,” said the sister-in-
charge. “You see, the operation was very seri-
ous, and she must be kept perfectly quiet for the
present.” The ministering angel touched him
gently on the coat sleeve, by way of telling him
to go. “I quite understand,” assented the hus-
band, cheerfully. “I knew the operation was to
be a serious one. The two doctors we had before
she came into the hospital were veYy kind, ex-
plaining things about it to me. I suppose they
felt they could, miss, me not being, so to speak,
an outsider. I’m a butcher by trade myself,”
Then he gave the sister-in-charge a brotherly
handshake, and said he would return at five
o’clock.
The city father’s life, from day to day, in the
dear old Home land (London Daily Mail,
8/5/’O7): —
With amazing sprightliness Sir William Treloar, the
Lord Mayor of London, danced merrily through the
streets of the old Cornish town of Helston yesterday for
an hour, cheered the while by the enthusiastic applause
of thousands of spectators.
It was a great day for Helston.
The Lord Mayor danced in silk hat and frock coat, and
often raised his hat during the dance to acknowledge the
cheers of the crowds.
Miss Madge Suttor, one of Francis Suttor’s
daughters, is engaged to a Mr. Hughes, a Ceylon
tea-planter. She is a good-looking girl, with very
fair hair, and a good musician.
Premier of Maoriland Ward, consort, and
ewe lamb Eileen, coruscated in Sydney for
two and a-half days. They were the guests
of Admiral Fawkes—that is, they slept at
Admiralty House, and had a State dinner
there and sundry breakfasts. Rest of the
time they were at “Avoca,” Mr. Owen Cox’s
place; butall through the coruscation the Kauriland
Premier was being pursued by the seekers of the
Press. A man came across from the N.Z. Times
for the purpose of accompanying and interviewing
him on board the Maheno. J. G. W. is fairly
thin. He was the only one of the extraneous
Premiers who took all the festive hurdles
programmed for them in the Cold Country,
And, on the authority of his private secretary, he
took ’em all on Apollinaris. The Ward lady
went about under our rain in a terrier-tweed
tailor-made and white fox furs, and the latest
waving tails of winged creatures. Dark-eyed
daughter Eileen, who has enough raven hair for
three nice girls, defied the weather in white serge.
They went out to lunch on the Cox launch on
Friday.
Sixty-nine Maorilanders sat down to the com-
plimentary lunch to J. G. W. at the Australia.
Colonel Burns and Chief Sec. Waddell spoke—at
some length. If any other man had a speech up
his larynx he wasn’t given a chance to say it, for
the guest took up the rest of the time with postal
and travel remarks. The address presented had
M.L. carvings and a view of Pinchgut and
Admiralty House. (Pinchgut after a gorgeous
feed !) Other functions faced by the trio were a
private reception by Lady Northcote—just they
three and a few of her Ex’s friends, and tea at
Federal Government House, a Ministerial tea-
party, and a reception by the Civic Chief (Mayor
Hughes) at the Town Hall.
Another of Governor Philip Gidley King’s
descendants is about to stand under a wedding
bell of flowers. Pretty Miss Olive King, of Goonoo
Goonoo, is engaged to Mr. Bruce Ryrie, of
Coolringdore station, Cooma.
The dramaturgists who conspired to compose
“ The Squatter’s Daughter ” have a right to wear
a chronic smile as wide as a bath. The wolf won’t
gnaw the knobs off their door.- Bert Bailey, one
of the pair who wrote the Cri. melodrama, nightly
entreats manager Anderson (after inspecting box-
office returns) to announce the last three years of
the piece. Edmund Duggan (“the other”) is
coming along with another drama, to be called
“The Southern Cross.”
Everybody who flies to Cairns for the North
Queensland winter trip brings back a picture post-
card of Dr. Quong Sue Duk and his numerous
family. Duk’s abundance of wives is a matter of
patriotic duty. “You see,” he explained to a
last-season visitor, “plenty of my countrymen
can’t afford to marry at all. Therefore the man
who can. afford to marry two, three, four wives,
ought to. For country’s sake, for ladies’ sake.”
So Quong Sue Duk has four —No. 1, No. 2, No. 3,
No. 4. It takes a good while to get through the
civilities when you meet the doctor, because
it is necessary to ask after the health of each
personality separately. Now the household —a
happy one, according to the local account —has
just had a wedding, the eldest Dukling, a girl of 15,
to a Chinese, who came down from Atherton, where
the big cedars grow, to claim her. Of course, since
the bride came out of the house of the greatest
stickler for Chinese national customs and observ-
ances in Australia, everything was just as it might
have been in Pekin. The first part of the cere-
mony took place in the home of the parents, where
the heavily-veiled bride brought tea to her pa, and
fell on her knees before him, and repeated the
performance before each of the four mas. Then
she was driven off to another house, but that part
of the ceremony wasn’t for the eyes of the
“ foreign devil.” Apparently Joss had nothing at
all to do with the business.
Nance O’Neil is in luck. She has been given
Belasco’s new play “ Cleo,” originally written for
Mrs. Leslie Carter. But Mrs. Carter, who has
recently married someone, has still more recently
quarrelled with someone with whom the disposal
of the play rests.
Miss Estelle Mabel Ward, our best (Sydney)
contralto, will give a concert at the Y.M.C.A.
Hall on July 3rd. Mrs. Grace Miller Ward (wife
of Hugh Ward) will give warble help in her sweet
soprano. Miss Nellie Marks and M. Henri
Staell will play their respective pet instruments—
piano and violin—and Mr. Reg. Gooud will make
his last appearance in Australia. He leaves for
England in the Macedonia. Signor Lardelli will
be the accompanist.
Miss Marie Hall has had paying houses all
through her season in Sydney. On Saturday
night—a night of rain above and mud below —the
Town Hall was more than half full, which makes
for a splendid audience. Violin students by the
score toddled along to every recital the pathetic-
ally slender young party has given. She is, to
them, a high-class lesson at a cheap rate, and the
Tait boys deserve all the glory reflected from their
star for their courage in bringing the marvellous
little fiddler to this hemisphere. Miss Hall has a
concert to-night, and on Friday a matinee will be
her farewelL to Australia. She leaves for Welling-
ton (M.L.) next day.
The cables, which tell us so much of trash,
forgot to mention the death in Parislast month of J.
K. Huysmans, one of the remarkable writers of the
century. (I suspect those London cable people of
a ghastly amount of ignorance as to personalities.)
Huysmans was a genius of sensual observation,
who later developed into a mystic of genius.
His “Marthe,” “Soeurs Vatard,” and “Des
Esseintes ” were probably little known among the
general public, but his “en route” gave him a much
wider vogue; for therein his sensualism turns to
religion, and all the world is interested in soul
gropings (an English instance—the success of
“Robert Elsmere).” Huysmans died a Trappist
monk. He found the extreme enjoyment-point
of mystic sensualism in the monastery of La
Trappe and its hideously ascetic discipline.
From Brisbane: —
Brisbane failed to appreciate Carreno. The handsome
artist wasted her music on ill-filled benches. It may have
been the distance that the Exhibition is away from any-
where else, or the six-shillings toll; but hardly a musical
student, even, was to be seen at the show. Albani, who
arrived on Friday, was far better treated ; but then
Albani is such a friend of the dear Queen.
The Yacht Ball was the event of the season, and, having
an excellent supply of young men, maidens, and music, it
went extremely well. The stage was realistic flagship
bridge, and the supper tables a blaze of'wattle and yellow
true-lo vers’knots. , 1
The manning of the second ’Private Assembly on
Tuesday last was more satisfactory than of yore, proba-
bly owing to an influx of thqcommittee’s friends. There
are some comic tales going the rounds, by the way, of
how the exclusive line is drawn at mere man on these
occasions. It’s not that ft’s drawn tight, but “wavy”
like, if you understand what I mean.
The expected engagement between Lieut. Owen
Griffith (on the eve of sailing for Canada, for military
training) and Miss E. (Weenie) Newton, the youngest
daughter of Richard Newton, is being quietly announced
this week.
Artist Lilian Chauvel’s show of oil and water sketches
this week was opened by Chief Justice Pope Cooper. The
added breadth in this earnest little artist’s work is as
interesting as it is gratifying, and is one result of her
Paris study.
Another of the Morehead girls was quietly married this
week to Mr. Watson. This is the third chick of the late
B.D.M. to take a move.
“Rosna” writes from Adelaide :
The R.B.N.A. ball, at the Town Hall, on Thursday
(20th), was a hilarious spree, joined in by all the
medicos within coo-ee, everything available in the mili-
tary line, flocks of uniformed nurses, and a good sprinkling
of general public. Decorations were a mixture of red Mal-
tese crosses, red and white roses, and the sheltering palm.
The Exes, were there—Lady Le Hunte in gorgeous w'hite
and silver raiment. Mrs. Chief Justice Way wore yellow
chiffon ; pretty Mrs. John Downer and Mrs. (Command-
ant) Lee also adorned the buttercup shade, the former
with fetching touches of blue about it. A lovely frock
W'as worn by Mrs. Alick Buchanan —violet silk with
Maltese lace trimming. Miss Clowes, the young Viee-
Regal relative, wore green with quaint little tags flapping
from the shoulders.
At last Adelaide has caught “ Mother Goose” on the
wing, and built her a coop at the Theatre Royal, where she
is to be firmly secured till further notice. As ours is a good,
tame little State, that ahvays follows the lead of its big
Eastern brothers, its welcome of the bird was hearty.
Professor Henderson, of the ’Varsity, has been giving a
series of lectures on “ Hamlet,” and all the intellect and
some of the fashion fought for tickets —fought so much,
in fact, that the final lecture had to be moved from the
’Varsity to the Town Hall. His Ex. and Lady Le Hunte,
’Varsity Chancellor and Mrs. Way, Mrs. Herbert Rymill,
Mrs. Arthur Rymill and her young sister decorated the
first lecture, among a crowd of learned persons, wearing
spectacles and learned raiment.
That nice, sane fiddling Adelaide boy, Eugene Aider-
man, is studying at Brussels, nowadays, and his long-
haired maestro rejoices in the name of Caesar Thomson.
The occult Caesar is an Italian, andone of the first fiddling
masters in Europe. But why, why is he just plain Thom-
son? In the interests of his English and Australian
pupils, he ought at least to cultivate an alias with “ ski ”
at the end of it.
Yet another Adelaide boy is laurel-gathering at Cam-
bridge—-Ernest Chappie, who took his B.Sc. at Adelaide
’Varsity in 1903, and has since been studying electrical
engineering. He has only been at Cambridge since
October last, but he is already taking his second year’s
course. Also he passed his inter-collegiate examination
for Part I. of the Mechanical Science Tripos, and gained
an exhibition to boot. Ernest is a son of Frederic
Chappie, chief of Prince Alfred College', and a brother of
Dr. F. J. Chappie, B.Sc., M. 8., Ch.B. ; Alfred Chappie,
B.Sc., M.A. ; Marion Chappie, 8.A.; Dr. Phoebe Chappie,
8.A., M. 8., Ch.B. ; Harold Chappie, B.Sc., B.A. In fact,
the Chappie family wears exactly 28 letters after its
learned name. One brother is a tutor at Cambridge.
Miss Ethel Cooper, an Adelaide damsel, lately returned
from piano study in Germany, gave a sample of her skill
in the Town Hall banqueting room last week. Miss
Cooper was formerly a pupil of Bryceson Trehearne, of
the musical school at our own ’Varsity, but went off some
years ago without a complimentary concert or other
encumbrance ; also, while she was away no one sent us
the usual frantic messages that all Germany was at her
feet. But Tuesday’s concert proved that there would
have been more foundation than usual for such reports ;
for her technique is particularly remarkable. She gave
one solo and several ensemble numbers, assisted by charm-
ing Nora Kyffin Thomas, Elsie Cowell and Clarice
Gmeiner on fiddles, and Herr Kugelburg’celling ; and the
populace encored her with unusual persistence. These
days it is a relief to have a damsel burst upon the public in
this way, without yards of self-advertisement beforehand.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
Why shouldn’t beautiful women be always
beautiful? She has the desire—that is certain, and just
as certain is it that she has the means. You’re not so
sure of that ? Well, then, you haven’t used Yalaze. Yes, yes,
Yalaze only makes the Complexion beautiful—but what
more does Beauty require ? A soft, clear skin, smooth to
the touch, and fresh to look upon —and wherefore sigh,
O Ladies? Nature gave you this in youth and early girl-
hood—Valaze preserves it longinto the years. Therefore,
Vive Valaze I —use Valaze, and your complexion will be
like unto the lily, fair, bright, and beautiful. Those
nasty, creeping wrinkles, those insinuating crowsfeet
that gather at the eye corners—they fly before Valaze.
Just get a jar yourself and try—you’ll know then how it
is so many elderly women of your acquaintance seem to
simply defy Time. Valaze —that’s all. Valaze is sold by
chemists everywhere at 3s. 6d. and 6s. jar, or posted 6d.

The abolition of electors’ rights in N.S.W.
State elections will, it is considered, unfavorably
affect the prospects of some of N.S.W.’s subtlest
parliamentarians. Electors’ rights were as good
as bank notes in certain quarters about election
time. Impersonation and the practice of voting
“dead ’uns ” will continue to flourish, however.
The agent of one prominent Federal politician
claims that he votes the dead, strayed and gaoled
of the constituency by the score, every three
years, and at a very reasonable price too.
Having bestowed upon British politics that
intellectual stimulation which is the best spur to
Erogress, our Alfred returns like a conquering
ero, with the radiance of his victories beaming
from his brow. And this is understood to be
mainly the result of his having been induced to
choose D.C.L. for his whisky when he needed just
one nip of inspiration. Let us call it the Whisky

Sydney Telegraph has printed the plain-
tive wail of a contributor, who told how he had
seen Tommy Tanna’s graveyard up North, and
his empty church ; and he deplored the return of
the Islanders with “ the scar on their souls of the
White Australia which has ostracised them as a
reward for years of patient toil and of good life.”
If cant will get this man through the Gate, he will
be there for sure. Any other sort of man who saw
a country littered with graves after a very short
occupation would have dropped to the truth—
that the cruelty was, not in sending the survivors
back to their own country, but in bringing them
to a strange country and to strange work, wherein
they died in appalling numbers. Of white people,
the Queensland death rate for five years (1899-
1903) from tubercular diseases was ‘042 per
1000; of Kanakas, it was 13'24 per 1000. That is
to say, for every white who died 315 Kanakas
died. No wonder the Telegraph’s contributor
saw Kanaka graveyards !

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, June 24, 1907.
My Dear Yarrie.—
Talk about the flutterings and palpitations of
the bride-to-be. They seem as nothing in com-
parison with the ague and fever indulged in by a
prospective bridegroom. A Melbourne bachelor
has just been best-manning a chum at a country-
city wedding. “I guarded him all night,” he
said. “ Such an experience ! He was all nerves
and tenter-hooks, as white as a sheet and
appallingly restless. After a forced and early
breakfast we took a drive —such a funereal- affair.
The pools and gutters were glassy with ice—the
air was gloriously fresh —and here was this poor
wretch, with chattering teeth and nerve-racking
air, acting as if he were doomed to be hanged at
that long approaching hour—three o’clock.” It is
getting to be an awful thing for a girl to take a
trembling man away from his happy home.
Joseph Ward, with his wife, daughter and son
Cyril, had a wild whirl round Melbourne what
time the Mooltan stayed in port. Dame Forrest
arranged a jolly and impromptu gathering of
about half-a-dozen womenkind to entertain Mrs.
and Miss Ward at the Grand, while a batch of
men-folk banqueted and speeched at Menzies’.
“Shine out, little head sunning over with
curls,” wrote Tennyson. The coiffure of to-day
might have been built hinder the personal super-
vision of the late Laureate. Every time I see
either Mrs. Raleigh or Mrs. George Chirnside I
wonder whether they have a sporting wager as to
who can wear the most curls at one time. Both
dames have hair growing thick and long on their
little heads, but fashion says “curls, pinned on,”
so curls pinned on it is, for them and a big
following.
With an endless list of burglaries, a hideous
murder, and some minor sensations lingering in
one’s memory, Age advertisements like this are
calculated to give one cold shivers: —
TJRANK SHELMERDINE ! If you do not kill the
Snake which Bit your Brother, It will Return
and kill you. *
Cryptic, but nasty !
A Union clubman tells of some tribulations
suffered by the ball committee of that superiah
association. An invitation to their annual spree
was sent to a gilded brewer of cheap beer. It
elicited a reply to the effect that he regretted,
etc., but would be proud to contribute four
barrels of his best for nix to help on the evening’s
merriment. Last year the sore point was an ex-
waiter and billiard-marker of the club, who had
been unsuspectingly bidden in his latest capacity
as a pretty heiress’s husband.
A plaintive male creature, full of years and ex-
perience, launches a complaint against the con-
temporary girl. “Girls, nowadays, are ex-
hausting. From the time a man commences to
bother with them, they pretend to be extra-
ordinary. They’re laboriously subtle, and they
want one to believe that they're unutterably
complex. They seldom are—they’re only incon-
sistent. And inconsistency is the most irritating
and deplorable of feminine faults. Girls who are
young and pretty quote Saltus to me—l’ve
never read him, but I fancy he’s vicious—or
else fling slabs of Suetonius, or Baudelaire,
or Nietzsche at me. I don’t want’em to do that. I
want them to talk about themselves, or me, or
their friends. But no ! the little fools don’t realise
the charm that up-to-date gossip and smart per-
sonalities have for a man. Instead, they plunge
into a morass of quotations and inept comments,
and flounder in it as long as they have an audi-
ence. Or else they have some other ‘ subtle ’ pose.
Pretty girls—very pretty ones—do the silent
Madonna business. Sickening! Or they affect a
diablerie, which they lack the courage to carry to
its logical conclusion, and anyhow deprecate bit-
terly in other women. Bah! the girl of this
decade is full sister to the aesthetic youth of the
early ’nineties. And the kindest thing to be
hoped is that she’ll follow his example, and con-
sign her dislocated ideals and her papier-mache
idols to the dust-box.”
The lord of creation responsible for this splurge
forgot—as most of his brethren do that the
simple child of Nature usually “gets left” in a
competition for his favor. She hasn’t sufficient
art of simulation to pretend that she’s her own
antithesis, and she never takes him round a sharp
corner. Neither does she conceal her thorough
comprehension of him—which is usually discon-
certing to Master Man !
Plump Celia Ghiloni, of the topaz eyes and the
golden mane, has been immortalised by an explor-
ing admirer. The E. A. is roaming around in the
Never-Never; and lately he came upon a smiling
river and a fertile mount. Now, maps of the
interior will discover them to students, as Mount
Celia and Ghiloni River. The lady considers the
compliment more delightful than a diamond
parure. In her dreams she hears the gentle
murmur of the river that bears her name. It is a
pretty story; but one may have doubts about the
hitherto undiscovered river in the Never-Never.
Sweet Nell Stewart dashed through our village
last week on her way to the Old World. She was
too hurried to be very coherent; but she announced
a subsequent return to dear Australia, and a
budget of schemes to adorn her reputation with
fresh laurels. Some new garments of surprising
shape made a fugitive appearance with their
designer. One, of blue blanketing, with greenstone
buttons and vivid suede details, worn with a hat
like a random handful drawn from a glory-box, left
an unforgetable impression on the feminine minds
which aren’t brave enough to wear fancy-dress for
the sake of making a sensation.
Commander Richardson, who has been hiding
his light in a subordinate position in a Federal
department for some time, retrieves his old glory,
and migrates to Queensland to fulfil some gold-
braided office there. His dame relinquishes her
share of the profits and responsibility of a swagger
guest-house, and accompanies him. The couple
have been out of evidence considerably since the
period when they shone in the reflected glory of
the Ducal Yorks.
Despite (or, perhaps, because of) the activity of
’igh Sassiety on behalf of St. Vincent’s Ball,
the cash results are contemptible. The pro-
fits are much less than in former years.
People whose social menu’s star item is a subscrip-
tion ball, want to show themselves and their
frocks, rather than gaze from afar upon the
gorgeously-gowned elect. So the well-advertised
intentions of certain dames reduced the ticket-
sales, and converted the charity function into
something resembling a private kick-up and a
financial frost. However, the set organisers and
their chums had an amusing evening. They feel
quite happy.
The little Best-girl—who is Lieutenant
Broad’s very best—is upholding, hef newly-wed
dignity with a series of At-Honies. The small
and youthful pair shunt housekeeping, and frivol
_as paving guests in the smallest and quietest of
three co-operative guest-houses; but the shy-look-
ing little hostess shakes the paw of the critical
caller in the big drawing-room of the most swag-
ger house—which makes a finer point of objective
for the long tail of carriages and motors that
flash along the main road of the sea-suburb. The
bride is so little and young and shy that she seems
to need someone bigger and more protective to
look after her than her quiet boy-husband.
On Friday afternoon his Waxellency ceremon-
ised the opening of new buildings for the Deaf
and Dumb Asylum in St. Kilda-road. The annexe
consists of two large wings : class rooms, dormi-
tories, and hospital. The extra room was sorely
needed. Now the furnishing has to come. Much
energy has been expended in raising the charity
wind. A big garden fete added about £7OO
recently. Perhaps the smartest effort was made
by some schoolgirls, who worked a small bazaar
by themselves, holding committee meetings in
most businesslike way, without any aid from
“grown-ups.” The girls eventually handed
over a solid sum to the asylum funds. The
Waxellency spoke a pretty speech, in quite his
old form, and then presented a life-governorship
certificate to four members of the official crowd.
It has become so much the thing to chat over
tea and scone to the accompaniment of a Menzies’
lounge concert at Friday’s tea-time, that crowds
of frillv-frocked would-be gossipers are crowded
out of the palm-bowered lounge. So a fashionable
tea-room keeper is taking the competitive incen-
tive, and announces that music and song will be
laid on every Tuesday from next week onward.
The Winter Garden is freshly decorated, and the
maidens of the scone-tea have been busy over some
thousands of fresh wisteria and cherry blossoms
for the decking of their underground halls.
Talking of official greatness —truly, the mayoral
ball at Prahran touched the very toppest notch
of Gilbertian impressiveness. Poor would-be
dancers have become inured to the custom of
initial “sets,” and are beginning to rush the
front rows of the balcony at the outset, in order to
get some fun out of their forced wait. Even the
absorbing programme-filling is being shoved along
to “after sets.”
At the P ran, the viewers had their time’s
worth. Mayor Flintoft, the genial potentate of
the shoppy district, was backed up by a bunch
(should this be “galaxy”?) of other fur-robed
figureheads from surrounding suburbs, with the
shining star of Gaud Mayor Weedon in the lead.
Not a jot of their importance was lost. Plain
ordinary guests arrived to find soft lights under
rose covers, whilst the band played soft music to
match the prevailing mystery. At a fashionable
hour some umpire-like person in the throng blew
a whistle ; there was a sudden blaze of electrics,
and four stewards, waving be-ribboned poles,
cleared an avenue down the length of the hall.
“ Who’s coming?” was the awesome, wide-eyed
inquiry of the crowd. A wondrous procession
hove in view. Mayors by the dozen—fur robes,
gold harness, and bald heads, with mayoral wives
all glitter and bouquet—solemnly-paced dais-
ward. One looked for the Pied Piper to come
dancing in after. Then the official and debutante
sets were formed, and the balcony breathed more
easily. It might have missed that procession !
There were many Debs of various types and
divers ages. Some of the buds looked as if they’d
been kept on ice for their belated blossoming.
No matter, it was quite a gorgeously-dressed
dance, with a good sprinkling of youthfui officials,
who dearly love their uniform.
Little Miss Knipe, the nine-year-old heiress,
whose whereabouts has been engaging the costly
attention of the Courts, is a large-limbed, splendid
type of child. When her grandfather, the late
James Service, endowed the kiddie with ample
funds, he unwittingly broke up her home.
Dad rescued his offspring from the Cold
Country, t’other day, and carried her off
somewhere outside the jurisdiction of the
Commonwealth, refusing to hand her over till
Mum comes to terms re the girl’s residence.
The maternal parent’s grievance is the plight of
the little heiress, permitted to wander round the
wilds of Australasia with no better protector than
her own father—and an unwealthy father at that.
The alleged unfitness of Knipe pere seems to be a
purely financial question. Parents of a moneyed
minor invariably quarrel. Each is so desperately
anxious to get a lien on the little one’s love and
obedience, with an eye to its future prosperity.
Think of how barrister Purves hustled for the
control of an infant heiress many years ago. The
story has become historic.
A wedding which was got through very unob-
trusively a little while back was that of Mdlle.
Bijiron, sister of Mons. Bibron, “ professor ” of
dancing and deportment. The bride, a charming
and gracious Frenchwoman, has helped her brother
to put a drawing-room finish on the paces of most
"Melbourne prancers who have escaped the infec-
tion of stage dancing. The bridegroom is a lawyer
of the Chosen Race.
Chief Justice Madden has discovered a loop-
hole in the will of the late S. T. Staughton
through which his widow may temporarily creep
from Australia. Said Chief Justice credits the
departed capitalist with patriotic sentiments in
requiring his widow to spend four years of every
five in this country. Opinions differ. It’s rash
of the widow to leave that Wimmen’s League of
hers, for there are a lot of people in it who may
learn to think for themselves in her absence, and
that would very seriously effect the Stout Female
crowd. By the way, a testimonial from the
League is sure to be included in the dame’s fare-
well tributes ; and, meanwhile, there’s a rumor
circulating that a feminine or two intend present-
ing Chief Justice John with a little recognition for
services rendered in enabling the Staughton dame
to quit Australia for a period of one year eight
months and sixteen days without sacrificing her
allowance.
A vastly entertaining report is giving Mel-
bourne folk something to talk about. A smart
penwoman who set sail recently for London en-
countered at Colombo a certain lord. Whether
he is wicked, after the lords of fiction, or just
human, like the lords of fact, has not yet tran-
spired. He and the pen-woman foregathered. In
the course of shipboard reminiscences they re-
called the fact that he had been a guest at Govern-
ment House, Melbourne, during the Brassey
regime, and the scribe had carefully in-
cluded him among her many lists of those
present. Much may happen between Colombo
and Plymouth. Quite evidently much did.
Already there’s a sound of "wedding bells
and a whiff of orange blossoms in the air. Said
lord goes by the name of Donahue. The title lias
a smack of old Ireland about it, but his paying
property being mostly in the North of England,
there’s probably a reasonable banking account
somewhere. Color is lent to the report
by the fact that already some of the jour-
nalist’s Sunday-best detractors are referring to
her as their “ own dear Araminta,” and are busy
inventing a lot of affection that her probable future
ladyship never suspected while she was doing the
nrHina.rv graft - , in IVfpilhnnmQ
The Sargoods have a feeling after hospitality.
The late Frederick liked nothing better than
treating all sorts of society to mammoth enter-
tainments. His wife had a genius for helping
laine dogs in the shape of struggling artists.
Between the two, quite a lot of nice, useful coin
of the realm was kept in circulation. Herbert
Sargood, head of the Melbourne firm, is a juvenile
father to the big firm. Last Saturday he collected
all the juveniles belonging to his employees, and
gave them the day of their life in the Prahran
Town Hall. At the end, a glorified Father
Christmas took the floor, and dispensed benefits
from a gigantic Christmas tree. All sorts and
conditions of youngsters were present, and each
one got a brown paper parcel, containing some-
thing sufficiently substantial to send it home
rejoicing.
At last we have one ! —a lady who rides astride !
Some of the other States have seen one before;
but she comes to this dull town only now. And
she is as welcome as the Goddess of Mirth (if
there is one!). Our lady weighs 14 stone at
least, and boasts a ravishing figure, and a head of
burnished hair. She takes her riding lessons
along the Block. She puts her amiable and
decrepit prad to a semblance of a canter, and gets
him to gallantly clear all obstacles in the shape of
tramlines and such trifles, with all the nonchal-
ance of a circus-queen. The gilded youth and
the blase office-boy (“office cat,” I believe, is the
recognised term at the scene of this youth’s labors)
assemble on the kerb to watch her pass.
Why I know not, but small and prim and
rosebud is to be the correct thing in mouths once
again. Our grandmothers held that a pleasing
shape could be given to the mouth by repeating
rapidly, “ Papa, potatoes, poultry, prunes and
prism.” Australian girls go one better, and mur-
mur “ Boomanoomanah.”
Saw at the Glaciarium a very small maiden on
a new kind of skate most desirable for a beginner.
Each skate had two blades that made a balance
for the dainty little wearer when she was merely
walking or standing—a great improvement on the
frantic scramble and cut-up of a lorn beginner
stranded on one blade.
Military men battled in a boat race last
Saturday ; the pick of the Scotch Regiment
against the Field Artillery. The contest
was so close that a football team stopped
kicking, and climbed its fence in a body
to rush along the bank and cheer. Many officers
and an occasional much-befurred girl paraded the
breezy bank and admired the fast-growing im-
provements in flower and shrub decoration, while
they waited for the all-important “turn at the
Bend,” and the incidental rushing crowd. No
explanation was forthcoming as to the reason why
the warrior crews had selected the chilly month
of June for their rowing match, instead of reserv-
ing it for Henley on the Yarra.
The off-stage attractions of the maidens who
are to gyrate ’neath the beams of “ The Blue
Moon ” haven’t galvanised this city into wild
enthusiasm. The Murphy Sisters are nice; but
(despite J.C.W.’s encomiums) not sensational.
And the little ladies imported to give “tone” to the
co. and be good examples to the abounding Aus-
tralian soubrette, are unofficially just usual young
people with the inevitable repertoire of humor-
ously intended anecdotes and unexceptionable
wardrobes. Miss Maude Thorn, wide-eyed ingenue,
is the belle of the shipment. The imported males
are more arresting. One is an Oxford man, and
some are experienced actors. The one who says
“ Haw ! ” with the unimpeachable accent, already
has a tea and crumpet following. Our own Pat
Bathurst also has opportunities, mostly on the
strength of his Cold Country exile, apparently.
Mr. Ralph Laver, who, besides being himself,
is brother to cricketer Frank and musicianer W.
A. Laver, will shortly marry Miss Emmie Saun-
ders, of Brighton.
The mayoral Alexander family, and some other
philanthropists interested in the Richmond stall
at the forthcoming Deaf Mutes’ Bazaar, last
week gave a funds-gaining concert. It was
notable for the appearance of a damozel with a
voice, some art, and a pretty presence—Miss
Mollie Carew.
Quite a number of our rich are disappearing
over the Victorian horizon, or just taking another
cage for a “ furnished house ” term, and the sake
of a little variety. Mrs. Staughton goes off on a
pleasant itinerary, and lets “St. Neots”to the
Wm. Smiths of “ Ravenswood.” The latter
capitalists, in turn, have hired their St. Kilda-
road establishment to another restless family.
The Norman Menzies move to Alma-road. And
Mrs. Ross-Soden installs herself under a new
roof-tree of her very own. There are also others
who are on the move; but with them, alas !
landlords and bank overdrafts are the impelling
force.
Women caterers have got a move on at present.
Four of them have amalgamated, temporarily, for
the benefit of the Women’s Exhibition. Each one
guarantees to provide 500 teas —afternoon and
other variety—daily. They are going to make
the cafe department a dream—an epicure’s
dream. The solid mid-day meal is to be
provided daily by the embryo cooks devel-
oped in big quantities under our State school cook-
ing centres. Noone who has patronised one of these
centres fails to fare sumptuously, and there isn’t
a doubt but what the youngsters will give a first-
rate account of themselves. If you want mid-day
dinner at a State school dining-room, you’ve got
to make up your mind to go early and avoid the
rush. You’re safe to get glared at by the man
whose place you’ve taken; but once you’ve got
used to that you will not find much fault with
your dinner. The girls are taught marketing,
waiting, and the setting of tables, as well as cook-
ing and serving. They marry young, do these
girls, and their husbands live happily ever after.
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
The Yictonan fraud of a land-tax dates
back to 1877, and it hasn’t been altered since.
In 1877 the dairying business was practically
unborn, and land which has a special value for
dairy-farming purposes, and can command big
rents from the cow-raiser, is still assessed at the
same old rate. The one basis of valuation is
sheep-carrying capacity—if one landlord owned a
square mile in Melbourne, Collingwood, or Rich-
mond, the land would still be valued according to
the number of sheep it would carry. (No estate
of under 640 acres is taxable at all.) If it wouldn’t
carry more than one sheep to the acre, it would
be valued at £2 per acre. And Collins-street, on
account of the road metal, the wood blocks, and
the paving stones, is mighty poor sheep-country.

able for less than a couple of
guineas; in fact, such an eye-piece
alone usually costs more than the
price charged for this complete
Telescope. The lenses are well
ground and adjusted, and the five
sections are perfectly fitted. There
is a metallic cap to protect the
object glass from injury and to
exclude dust. The section with the
eye-piece can be withdrawn and
used separately as a powerful mag-
nifier or microscope. The Tele-
scope when fully extended is over
3 feet 6 inches in length, and when
closed it measures about a foot. A
very useful book of instructions
and hints on the employment of
the Telescope for systematic Solar,
Lunar and Astronomical Observa-
tions and for ordinary purposes is
given with each instrument.
Tourists, residents at the seaside
and others able to enjoy wide and
extended views should have this
excellent and wonderfully cheap
Telescope.
Price, complete with book
of instructions, only 8/6,

Cable : Your suggested drink-reform, whereby
the interior of all pub bars and parlors shall be made
visible from the street by plate-glass windows, is imprac-
ticable. It would make things too awkward for the anti-
drink politicians. ..W.A.C. : “ You have been a supporter
of The Bulletin for many years ” ? Well, send a subscrip-
tion for the next 10,000 years, prepaid, and we’ll consider
publication of the howling libel you send along...
; Patriot : In short, there is not enough range accommoda-
tion for rifle practice. We know that, but welcome the
chance you give to rub the fact in... A.S.D. (Switzer-
land) : Thanks; glad to hear of an exile who remains a
patriotic Australian.... Burchie: Was inclined to accept
your view, as a miner and a man, that truckers purvey a
superior brand of profanity to bullockies—but you give
away the truckers’case at the finish. “The lads,” you
say, “are proud of their gift, but use it only when
they are in trouble.” Now it is just here the bullocky
scores: he always uses his gift, whether in trouble or
not. Practice is everything in the art of blasphemy
J.F. : Foolish anecdote re fox which didn’t eat your
parrot cost this office 4d. in deficient stampage....
Nearly Dead with Anxiety: Have no theories as to
whether it is best to be buried with the head north or
west, or any other way. Our advice is to select a dry
spot and lie with the feet downhill The Waster: You
seem to overlook the fact that The Bulletin has bar-
racked for Rodier’s system of rabbit destruction, when
you claim that it wants to preserve the bunny. To bring
new diseases into a country is too big a risk. You say
that the Broughton Island experiment wasn’t conclusive,
and a trial is required in the interior. Well, if it proved
that the disease attacked sheep, cattle, and human
beings, how would you shift the germ out of the interior
again ? We have imported rabbits, foxes, thistles, prickly
pear, burr, sparrows, Kanakas, and Heaven knows how
many other things, and been sorry almost every time....
Medi-Cuss : That cleric may have talked a bit wildly—it
is a way clerics have—but in regard to the evil of child
sweating at the cow bails, The Bulletin is with him. It
is hard to be over-wild on that subject. The fact that
the rag-importers sweat their employees doesn’t in the
least justify the farmer sweating his—still less does
it justify the latter sweating his own kids
J.D.M. : Squashed nigger yarn too horrible, and the
other has been told concerning 2467 J people 0.0. D.
(Northam) : Meanderings of Narracoorte nigger’s corpse
are at an end so far as these columns are concerned. The
body is due for reinterment Ratoon : None worth
print Dion: New and feeble version of “How happy
could I be with either” Oob : Strained and far-fetched.
E. Hill: Nothing in it but the dialect, and that’s
conventional Opal: Some of it is fine, but it’s only
“potch.”....,Ginger: Still don’t care for the poultry
yarn Roy: Obvious concoction Pedlar: Too much
tangled up.. Rabbiter : We’ve no use for mere humorless
mendacity Nemo: A remarkable flow of rhyme, but
that doesn’t necessarily make poetry Bluey : “Dark
Problem ” gets darker the longer it is considered
Spinner: Beneath derision Gawl: Well, here’s one
verse anyhow:—
Oh, Premier Price is a prince from Wales ;
He represents the Labor cause ;
And Tom has tried to lift the scales
That still prevent enlightened laws.
Mark Wallis : Poem about M'Dougall doesn’t quite
rise to the level of Shakspeare A. Jenkin: Presume
it is meant as a parody on the boy who stood on the com-
busted ship Young Lor Blime : Considering your
suggestion F.E.: We have received by this time so
many different stories about the “ discovery ” of Wanda
Radford that we reckon there must be about eight
of her....K.K. : Alas, that tram-car episode has
happened all over the world Fred Calistan:
Nothing really unusual about your drunk.....
J.P. : On your own evidence, it wasn’t lockjaw that
the horse suffered from St. Jimmy: Don’t care
for either Jean S. : All true, but all obvious
Carette : Seriously akin to silliness G.M.8.: Returned
accordingly W.H. : You are a funny fellow, and we
are sorry your screed is too unequal to succeed. ..
C.H.T.: Your best verse :
Ah, I long to hear the gurgling beer,
When drawn from the depths below ;
By the golden Miss, whom I used to kiss,
’Cos she said she loved me so ;
And to hear the yell at the final bell,
When we’re six goals four to nil;
And the joyous shout when Mike goes out
In the first, from our only Bill.
..Key Piece: Bottle-cutting discussion closed...
H.G.B. (W.A.) : Boiled down, your answer to “C.R.” is
that few but aborigines can tell the direction a snake has
taken by its track —and even aborigines can only do it
under favorable conditions, which appears to be a true
bill Falk : Article on cadet’s foolish uniform too
long for interest A.H.G.N. : Probably stamps were
not noticed, and yarn drifted to the W.P.B
Tortoise: Didn’t manage to crawl in F.J.H. : Good
of its kind, but we don’t care for allegories Hobson J. :
Same remark applies to you Fermit: Pretty good
verse, though too ornate, and too long in any case
Whiskers : The end is capital, but the lead-up is very
weak A.K.C.: Rather dry, and stiff of treatment
Jonah: Thrown overboard, accordingly Show; No
exception to our experience that screed deliberately
labelled “ poem ” never Is a poem C.C.A. : Yes; it’s
a good phrase ; but one phrase doesn’t make a poem
....Observer: Capital; but, alas, unprintable J.G.:
“ Biter ” should have been bitten-off a lot shorter
E. : Respectable verse. No reason why you shouldn’t
do better D.B. (W.A.): All three are spoilt by sundry
incongruously weak lines P.Q.F. : Simply' unintel-
ligible L.V.A.: It is pleasantly Gaelic in style ; other-
wise there’s not much in it Bandicoot: “Insects”
were promptly squashed Lew Natio : Appropriately
incoherent Wanderer: Wandered into the basket
G.R.K. : Creditable sentiments in discreditable verse
M. V.R.: Both jokes appeared in The Bulletin in bygone
years Mull: “Ninety-three” rather rugged Brad:
If he came out at all he would come out exactly as he
would from any other shaft at that or any other part of
the world—head first C.W.C.: A fine flow of language,
but no discoverable central idea Arthur H. : Too
trivial an incident for such extended narration
Bowlas (or something like that) : Practically undecipher-
able.. ..R.0.8. :No point or significance.... Weary W.:
Has some good thoughts, but the style is too sloppy
Helen K. : Too much dialect, and the dialect isn’t well
done. Who ever heard an Irishman say “ yourn ” and
“ his’n ”?.. ..A.O’D.: Might have been worse—but not
much! Lucie: Has a good lilt, but the theme
is very old and weary Reg B. : Absurdly far-
fetched and inappropriate Don: Very trim and
prim, but absolutely barren of interest Henry
F. : Wholly out of The Bulletin’s line... Viola: A
weak little warble about nothing in particular....
Swift: Lemonade is sometimes made from sulphuric acid;
few small makers of aerated waters make their own gas
when it can be bought in drums T.C. : (I) No. (2)
Gordon and Gotch.... Whiteman : No, it’s an impudent
lie. It was about that time the Australian Parliament
decided to continue the white sugar bonus Olla
Podrida : Your dog-shooter on Yanko was a bad shot or
something. There is no dog on earth that won’t suc-
cumb to a bullet in the right spot....lngleside: Sorry
they are not up to standard Kelpie : You have a good
metre-ear, and nothing more Arthur A.: Re-
turned accordingly The Batcher: Absolutely no-
thing in it S.G.G. : Has little to recommend
it Oglamite: You don’t make your meaning
clear enough....G.S.K. : Hardly well enough done....
Ruby P. : Entirely out of our line F.J.S. :
You’ve no idea of either prose or verse W.H.8.:
You don’t get any life or spirit into it
J. Love : Poetic of idea, but faulty of expression Ku-
Klux : “Australia ” is reasonably humorous, but. has too
many defects of detail F.J.L. : Thoroughly conven-
tional in tone... .Learner : More promise than perform-
ance as yet... .W.K. : Too hard to read Gully : Still
below the mark Alan D. M.: Not absolutely devoid of
merit Alf. K.: Very indifferent quality.. ..Demo : Not
far short of the mark... .Ugly D.: There’s a good deal of
undisciplined force in it... .Jack E.: “ Scrap o’ Cheese ”
isn’t worth the bit of bread that would be wanted to go
with it,...Leon: Quite out of our line... .W.A.T. :
You whoop vigorously, but ungrammatically....
Yaller Box: Were you suffering from “The Curse of
Drink ” yourself when you wrote it? Groper : Nearly
groped your way in F.G.O’L.: A more skilful hand
might have made something of it Maureen M.: Grace-
ful, but conventional; and the pietistic finish would
spoil it in any case.... W. J.W. : Pretty good of the sort,
but much too long A.K.C. : Begins well, but becomes
too prolix towards end Jas. S. : Versification very
imperfect Chuca: It very nearly hooked on Po-Hui:
Material good, but treatment not terse or vigorous enough.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
A.S.O. (Auckland) : As studies of girls’ heads they are
all right, and would make good subjects for a drawing
class to tackle, but we don’t publish studies of girl’s
heads. Don’t know any paper that does J.H.H. :
Picture of two old men in one bath firmly declined
M.H. : Confine yourself to the produce trade, etc. Black
and white work is not your game.... Harier (or some
such term): Picture of a man urging the execution of
Marie Hall declined without a moment’s hesitation
A.E.G. : Neither got a hope.... J.M. : Photo, of horrible-
looking freak animal received with thanks... .G.E.K. :
The legs of the good young man can’t bear inspection.

Re handing over the administration of the Land Act
to the Shire Councils (I!. 8/6/’O7). It strikes me forcibly
that the Councils have at present the administration of
more than they can cope with. Know one Shire where
Bathurst burrs are allowed to grow on the footpath right
opposite the Council rooms, whilst the town boundary
consists of a hedge composed of burrs and star thistles—
a new pest which promises to become a greater trouble to
the landholder than either rabbits or land agents.
From London Daily Mail (3/5/’O7) :
Numerous English houses, notably one famous firm of
glovemakers, have their own factories in Germany.
Exactly. The “curse of Protection” again.
Germany is rapidly being flooded with these
pesky British manufacturing concerns. Why
don’t the foolish German working men learn a
little Ereetrade sense, and hurl down their tariff
walls, and stop such pernicious practices ? True,
a number of them would lose lucrative jobs, but
what is a mere Job alongside a Principle?

“MICHELIN ” TYRES.
In the Eace for the Kaiser’s Cup, held at
Hamburg- on June 15, the First Five
Cars Home were fitted with MICHELIN
TYRES. The successful competitors had to travel
300 miles over a course that was most trying because
of its extreme roughness and hilliness. The winner,
Nazzaro, averaged 54 miles an hour, which gives some
idea of the terrific speed conditions of the race, and the
fact that the First Five Oars in such a severe contest
were fitted with MICHELINS is another most con-
vincing proof of the reliable qualities of these World-
famous Tyres. Sole Australian Agents—

The Bulletin Newspaper Co. has to say to the Australian public “ Thank you.”
Never before in Australian newspaper history—probably never before in any other country —has the call to help a
new enterprise met with a more generous response.
As soon as The Lone Hand was announced, subscriptions began to trickle in. As the date of publication neared, the
trickle became a stream. Before a copy was put on the market the orders in hand ensured success. When, at last, the public
had The Lone Hand available for reading, the rush of purchasers quickly passed the wide bounds which the most optimistic
forecast had set for the circulation. The sale of the first number we took as a sign of the confidence Australia had that any
Bulletin enterprise would be a “square” thing. The even more satisfactory sale of the second number (more satisfactory because
The Bulletin devoted 500 of the first number as special “ complimentaries ” to old Bulletin subscribers in the backblocks, lest
they should miss it, and that gift was not repeated), showed that the public considered that that confidence had been justified.
Bor the future our aim will be to further warrant that confidence with a record of steady improvement. The prompt
acceptance of The Lone Hand has enabled the proprietors to cut from the expenses much which would otherwise have been
devoted to sales organisation and advertisements. The money thus saved will be put into the magazine. It will mean better
matter, better illustrations, better printing. A complete color-printing plant is being now installed, and, with the Sprint, will be
adding bright pictures of Australia’s sunlight to The Lone Hand.
But that is for September. For July, the dull mid-Winter month, a special effort has been directed to making The Lone
Hand breezy, humorous, and strong in story and pictures. There are no less than eleven stories, covering the whole range of
Australian life—from a romance of the early days of the foundation of Australia, by Howard Ashton, to a sympathetic bush study
by Henry Lawson. Humor is richly represented by “ Two of a Trade,” by the late Victor Haley, with pictures by “ Hop”; “An
Election Speech”: a set of koala pictures by Norman Lindsay; “Two Battlers and a Bear,” by Edward Hyson; and many a
smileful sketch, such as “ Tarboy’s ” “ Happy Jack.”
In more serious vein is a denunciation as a sweater of one of Australia’s great industrial, political and religious magnates,
and a fine prose poem of the bush by Frank Myers.
A big, bright budget of Australian life, full of cheery optimism and gay laughter, and, through all, a serious purpose. That’s
The Lone Hand for July.
You should do your duty by yourself and buy the July number. You should then do your duty by Australia, and, after
reading, post it abroad as an answer to stinking fish cries. Make sure of getting successive numbers by subscribing either direct
to the office or to the nearest newsagent.

Incessant rain and resultant quagmire condi-
tion of the course caused Canterbury Park (Sydney)
Racing Club to put off its meeting, in the list for last
Saturday week, till it couldn’t, according to Chief Secre-
tary Hogue, be delayed longer. His reading of the Act
is that a postponed racing event must take place within
a week of date originally fixed, or not at all ; but some
Sydney legal people differ, and there are probably fat
fees ahead for certain “ gents one ” before the point is
settled.
* * * *
Up to Friday last erstwhile speedy Mary of
Argyle hadn’t won once in three years, but she acted like
a well bottled-up good thing in gathering Canterbury
Park Stewards’ Mile, and, next day (Saturday), despite a
101 b. penalty, easily closed on Rosehill June Stakes, and
later in the same afternoon, though penalised again and
to the extent of 141 b., went under by a length only to
War Bee in the Winter Stakes after showing the way
alone for some time. Weight told during the last few
strides.
* * * *
Top-notch all-round M.L. rider, A. Julian, did
something decidedly uncommon at Auckland R. C.’s
recent meeting. Competent to figure in 18 events, he
had 16 mounts—half over jumps, the rest on the flat.
Getting through his several tasks Julian covered 27f miles
of race track, and was carried over 119 obstacles. Jockeys
with such stamina and so thoroughly attuned physically
are rare birds indeed these times.
■* * * *
The luck of the game. Little more than a week
ago racehorses Lantier and Stuart King were up for sale.
There wasn’t a bid for Lantier, and a reserve of £lOO
blocked the transfer of Stuart King, yet each has since
got away with a race. Lantier won Handicap Steeple, and
Stuart King the Welter, at Port Adelaide meeting during
same afternoon.
* * * *
Happenings at Canterbury Park and Rosehill
race meetings, Friday and Satin-day of last week, demon-
strated that presence of whitewashed ponies among the
horses will seriously complicate matters for punters
generally till the relative merits of the new and the old
are demonstrated. Half the Park Stakes field at Can-
terbury was made up of pony recruits, and they had the
finish to themselves almost. Hot favorite Lady Rose was
coming home alone in Rosehill Flying Welter, when pony
Morok (about whom 20 to 1 might easily have been
secured) worked up a strong, late run, and just landed
the coin. Same day observant people saw that with ordi-
nary luck pony Lamora (third) would surely have beaten
the two in front of her in Granville Stakes, and ponies
Metallist and Konig shaped well enough in Winter Stakes
to suggest they’ll go mighty close to success when money
from the right quarter is on.

Wind, rain and mud were the setting of 4he
much-looked-forward-to meeting of the South Sydney
and University teams in Sydney Metropolitan Rugby
competition. On paper University should, in decent
weather, have won with comparative ease, but the South
barrackers were painfully confident, the sandplugging
team being much the stronger from a muscular stand-
point. In spite of the cold, raw weather, 10,000 people
rolled into Sydney Cricket Ground, and shivered and
cheered in turns. Viking Rawson was there, so was Pro-
fessor Starr Jordan, who was anxious to see what sort of
an animal Australian Rugby is. South, with the wind
against them, attacked furiously, and the blue and gold
’Varsity defended as grimly. South proved to be faster
in the mud than the collegians, and penned the latter up
in their own 25, while they strove vigorously to break
through the blue and gold defence. When the
Southern attack weakened, University let go, and
got the leather into Southern territory, where a de-
fender, trying to centre, kicked into the hands of a
Uni. three-quarter. It |was the collegians’ first chance,
and the board showed them leading by five to nil. In
the second half, with the wind against them, University
men were on the defensive the whole time. Fortunately
for them, the Southern men got excited, and, dropping
combination, went in for the private enterprise game.
The score was equalised early in the half, and after that
South threw victory away, and the University, which
ought to have been dog-walloped, went home highly
elated to have played a drawn game and maintained the
club’s position in the front rank of the competition.
None of the other matches drew more than
2000 people. The disaster of the day was the defeat of
Balmain by Newtown, the figures being 14 to three. North
Sydney bore Balmain company in its misfortune, being
donkey-licked by Sydney—l 4 to five. The surprise of
the afternoon was the stand made by Manly against
Eastern Suburbs, the Village being beaten by five to nil
only. Manly has improved marvellously, and if the pre-
sent rate continues, by next season should have a really
good team. St. George was quite unable to stand against
Western Suburbs, which ran over it to the tune of nine
to three.
* * * *
The University, South Sydney, and Eastern
Suburbs are now together in the front rank of the com-
petition, with 11 poihts each. Glebe, in spite of its recent
run of ill-luck, is in the second row with 10 points.
Newtown and Western Suburbs are nine each, Sydney
eight, North Sydney six, St. George, Balmain, and Manly
four, three, and two respectively.

Sydney Soccer crowd had a most hilarious time
on Saturday. Once a man started to run in the mud he
ever knew where he would arrive ; it was humorous
enough from the standpoint of the spectator, but hard
on the players. It was an important day, too, Glebe and
Pyrmont meeting to decide who should step down from
the front rank of the competition. Pyrmont won by
three goals to one. Curiously enough, it was the sound
defence of Pyrmont that gave it the victory by prevent-
ing Glebe’s return charges from scoring. Glebe’s defence
was weak, and the result was disaster. Rozelle had the
bye. Ultimo just managed to defeat Petersham by one
goal to nil in a magnificent exhibition of mudlark-
ing, and Balmain beat the Navy by four to nil. The
Navy men have not found their land legs yet.
The Balmain-Navy contest degenerated into some-
thing between a scrap and a slangwhanging match.
By defeating Glebe, Pyrmont mounted to the top of the
competition list with 12 points. Glebe, Balmain and
Ultimo are in the second line with 10 each, and Rozelle,
Petersham and the Navy have seven, five and two
respectively.
In the League competition (Australian Rules),
Sydney has now got the substantial lead of four
points, the next clubs on the list (Redfern, Newtown,
Y.M.C.A.) having eight each. Then East Sydney with
six, and Balmain and North Shore with two each, and
Paddington with none.

F. P. O’Donnell, foreman of Kilmore (Vic.)
Advertiser printing office, the other Saturday, playing
football against Romsey, was in the act of taking a
“ mark ” when he was capsized and stunned, but he
automatically rose and booted the ball through the
posts. Then he collapsed, and didn’t recover conscious-
ness till the following Monday, when he first heard the
glad tidings of his goal.

Rugby as it looks to an Adelaide heretic, who
grew up on football under Australian rules :—“When I
was in Sydney, the other day, I got acquainted with
Rugbj'. Having for years read Bulletin accounts of ex-
citing contests, I approached the ground in the expectant
spirit of a man about to be admitted to a first-class heavy-
weight fight. At the end of a quarter of an hour I was
most grateful to two gentlemen near me for providing an
entertaining mill, stopped too soon by an officious police.
Rugby may be an excellent entertainment for the players,
but as a spectacle ! The ball was kicked off, returned,
and the referee blew bis whistle. Then most of the
players put their heads together, with arms clasped
round waists, and kicked each other’s shins until the ball
was thrown in amongst the seething bootleather. Sud-
denly the ball emerged, was seized by a man in red, who
was grabbed by the throat by a man in blue. After a
brief combat the ball was forced out of bounds, and the
referee blew his whistle. A player was partially slain,
and the referee blew more whistle. More scrum, more
whistle. The kicking of the ball —not of opponents, that
was effective—was wretched. The only decent spectacu-
lar features were the combined passing runs, which were
occasional bright spots. The Australian game started
with a Rugby foundation, and the faults were gradually
eliminated until a continuous, fast, and scientific sport
was manufactured out of the clumsy British aborigines’
rough-and-tumble. I suggest that, if the dreary pastime
is not abolished altogether, the referee be provided with
an instrument that will play tunes. That would be some-
thing to go on with.”

By loaded cab and waggon and overloaded train
some 25,000 persons betook themselves to St. Kilda (Vic.)
ground on Saturday, to see if Carlton could turn the
tables in its return match with Saints. The first match
of the season had given the ex-premiers the surprise of
their lives, when the Saints walloped them by 56 points
to 30, and they were eager to avenge the defeat. They
accomplished this, certainly ; but with no great credit ;
the board at the finish showing Carlton, 8 goals 14
behinds; St. Kilda, 3 goals 15 behinds. A brand new
umpire had been laid on for the occasion, and he justified
his selection ; but the game was only so-so. Fast,
unscientific, and rough, but not with the roughness
of the previous Saturday, when deliberate punches
and dirty elbow-jabs were the order of the day.
In the first quarter Saints sustained a heavy loss through
Renfrey getting an already weak ankle trodden on, and
though he had it bandaged and came out again he was of
little use to his side. In the last quarter Brain (Saints)
pushed his face against someone’s elbow and had to retire,
and at times other, players were limping about looking
the worse for wear. Nevertheless, there were a few
brilliant flashes of concerted play, mostly by Carlton ;
but as that team led by two to one from the first quarter
there was little interest and less excitement. The ’Roy
v. ’Wood disturbance gave far better football. At quarter
time the Maroons had notched seven clean goals to
’Wood’s one goal three behinds. From thence to the middle
of the last quarter they scored not a single point, while
the Magpies raised their tally to 10 goals 12 behinds. Then
Roy realised that something had to be done—that 7 goals
n one quarter, and nothing afterwards, was unaccount-
able—and by strenuous, systematic play, they put on 4
goals and 3 behinds. But’Wood interposed with another
goal, and departed winners by 9 points. After the im-
proving “ Sowth’s” victory over Saints, they should have
made mincemeat of Melbourne, but that “ surprising re-
versal of form ” that usually arrives about this time of the
year duly transpired, and after a rough game, in the last
quarter of which they used their weight to the full,
“Skinner’s Hirelings” had to lower their colors to Mel-
bourne by 2 goals—4o points to 52. The Geelong-Essendon
argument was courteously but strenuously conducted,
before a good “ audience ”; but as these clubs promise to
adorn the tail end of the list, there is not so much in-
terest in their proceedings. The sea-siders had the
best of the game throughout, winning by 53
points to 28. In the Association the unbeaten
Williamstown team, after leading throughout, was out-
stayed by Essendon in the last half-hour, and lost its
pretty record by 3 points—4o to 37. Ex-premiers West
sustained their second defeat, this time by Footseray ;
the result being apparently due to strabismus on the part
of the forwards, who kicked 2 goals 19 behinds to ’Scray’s
7 goals 6 behinds. North Melbourne sustained its seventh
consecutive defeat, and as one of its best players was
seduced away to Essendon (League) last week, it looks as
if the consecutiveness of the noughts is likely to continue.
During the week the Association committee called its
captains before it and spoke to them firmly on the
necessity of each keeping his men well in hand, “ lest the
Association get itself spoken of as scornfully as the
League ” ; and the Metropolitan Association disqualified
one player for the season and another till July 6th, for
undue vigor on the field.
* * • *
Since the League match, South v. Saints, on
June 15th, Melbourne papers have teemed with letters on
the roughness of the football. Few of the correspondents,
in suggesting various remedies, hint at the cause of this
“ savage play,” as the Argus called it. The worst
offenders are undoubtedly the heaviest teams—South,
Saints and Carlton —and it is not so much wilful brutality
as the roughness of the big, lusty athlete unconsciously
using his strength where the lighter man relies—because
he has to—on skill. The trouble is to distinguish
between wilful roughness and ordinary casual bump-
ing. Bendigo District Football Association has made
an attempt to grapple with the evil by appointing
two stewards—other than ordinary club officials—
to watch proceedings and report; but how or why their
report is to be any more effective than that of the umpire,
goodness knows. A lot of this rough play would suddenly
cease if the League gave the umpires power to order an
offender off the field) as a referee may do in the Rugby
game ; or if they would only back up their umpires when
they do report ill-regulated play. Last year an umpire
reported a League player for striking another. The
delegates enquired. The man who had been struck —
the blow had been seen by everybody—said he had
no recollection thereof, and the punch, if there was
one, must have been accidental. Charge dismissed. That
umpire reported no more players, and no wonder. As a
committeeman afterwards said, “ Well, we had to square
. We weren’t going to have our best forward dis-
qualified for the finals, after finding him a billet and
paying exes all the season. Ten to one he’d go to
another club next year.” That is where the trouble lies.
Billets and exes ! The man who gets these has to earn
them, or he won’t be wanted next year. One way is by
showing superior skill. Another is by “ outing ” a possi-
ble rival. He has to win matches somehow, or his name
is Mud. And when he sees men such as G an**
C , who are notorious for rough play, and wh°
are hooted almost every time they appear, picked
regularly ; when he sees brawls passed over un-
punished Saturday after Saturday ; well, he goes and
does likewise. District football would do away with most,
if not all, of this semi-professionalism ; it would increase
the popularity of the game by giving the barrackers a
genuine interest in the team representing their suburb ;
and it would probably give the League delegates some
much-needed backbone, for there would be less necessity
for friendly back-scratching in the interests of semi-paid
players. Probaby both League and Association will see
this when, in the course of a year or two, they have
got professional football on thie reef which wrecked
pedestrianism.

The amateur boxing and wrestling champion-
ships were concluded in Sydney on Saturday night. The
man who likes to sit in quiet comfort and see skin and
hair shifted had a week’s thorough enjoyment at these
competitions. There was mighty little science, but un-
limited quantities of enthusiasm and punishment. Men
came up again and again to take punishment which no
professional would dream of standing. The pro. would
have considered it absolutely brutal. Writer doesn’t
know what the men who took the punishment get, but
the place was crowded every night, and someone has
made a pot of money out of the business.

The U.S. A. has apparently gone raving mad to

forced the price up to $40,000, and are now inquiring if
there is any advance on $40,000.

Charlie Griffen and Frank Thorn, former a
Maorilander, latter a Westralian, boxed the most strenu-
ous battle of featherweights seen in Melbourne for lOyears,
at Melbourne Pavilion, the other Monday night. Thorn,
who is champion, fixed a 9st. 51b. limit for Griffen, and
the Maorilander, for fear of forfeiting, took a pound or
two too much off, and came into the ring scaling 9.1,
while Thorn, the red-gum black, ran to 9’4. This on top
of Thorn’s greater cleverness, gave Charlie a hard row to
hoe, but he hoed it like a hero. He fought
Thorn clean through 20 rounds, and had so much to
the good that the small Westerner was hugging him like
a brother for about one-third of the last five rounds, and
in one the champion had been glad to take the limit on the
boards. Frank is certainly the better boxer, and he
notched a lot of points, but Charles never left him, and
pasted in much telling stuff at close quarters. Referee
Cosson did not feel justified in parting them after the
20th, and ordered two more. The additional two were a
repetition of the previous five. Thorn rocked in three
good punches, but in the 22nd he was almost dead, and
resumed his hang-on tactics. The verdict for Thorn may
be regarded as an inducement to that bright boy to rope
himself round his enemy’s neck for two minutes out of
every three when they meet again. Griffen went
home, and was ill as the result of body punishment.
The papers represented his disorder as serious, and
Judkins got his banner out for a new crusade, but next
day Charles was at Wren’s front door supplicating for
another go at Thorn at the earliest possible moment.
All the same, it is folly to fix up no-draw regu-
lations, and bind a referee to a decision no matter how
tough the mill has been. These lads had fought as much
as it was safe for any lads to battle in one night, and a
draw would have been a fair thing to both. The no-draw
stipulation is one the police should drop a large official
foot upon, before real mischief happens as a result of a
game pug taking more than is good for him.

The Melbourne Wednesday League matches,
which are supposed to be for the edification of, if not
actually played by, the courteous shop assistant and the
lady-like counter’jumper, provide quite as willing argu-
ments as the Saturday games. Last Wednesday the only
two unbeaten clubs of that league—’Wood and Saints—
met on Saints’ ground and had a really great afternoon
out. There were two scraps in the second quarter, the
umpire having to stop the game while he sorted things out.
Then there was a really chic little mill among the
barrackers. This had hardly ceased ere two more players
got “into holts,” and again the game was stopped.
The third quarter saw a fierce fistic argument between
two grand-stand patrons, whose respective friends
enthusiastically joined in the uproar. Next a pitched
battle happened in the middle of the ground, the luckless
umpire getting the usual reward of a man who interferes
in a fight. As the watches were stopped during these
disturbances, the fourth quarter was played in semi-
darkness, and there may have been a dozen more fights ;
if so, they were lost. Nobody seemed to know where the
ball was half the time, but that scarcely mattered. There
was always a kickable player visible. The discussion
ended with St. Kilda 34 points, Collingwood 28. No
records were taken of injuries. But really football
scores ought to read : Saints, 4 goals 9 behinds 3 black
eyes ; Ports, 2 goals 8 behinds 2 broken limbs.

Under the headings, “ British Horse Supreme,

(16/6/’O7) that “ Mr. Glencross, with all four Australian-
bred horses, won the first prize of £lOO and the champion-
ship for high jump at 6ft. 9in.” If Granny knew any-
thing of Australian sporting affairs, she ought to have
known that Glencross won the high jump, 6ft. 9in., and
the special, 7ft. 4in., with the famous Australian-bred
horse “ All Fours,” which had a record of 6ft. llin. before
he went to England.

To attract the fastest cars in the world and
hold the speed records, a magnificent track, specially
banked for high speeds, has been laid down at Brook-
lands (Eng.), at a cost of £lOO,OOO. The first racing is to
take place there on July 6. The track is pear-shaped,
with a circuit of 3J miles. Its concrete surface, 90ft.
wide, is banked at the turns so that a man may swing
round the corners at over 100 miles an hour. If it is the
success looked for, Ormond-Daytona beach will be knocked
right out. The grand stands, etc., will be in the centre,
and the spectator can sit there in comfort and watch a
race of a thousand miles. Already £15,000 has been
subscribed for a prize fund, and it is hoped that it will be
possible to arrange for a meeting at Brooklands of the
winners of the Grand Prix, Tourist Trophy, Kaiser’s Cup,
Targa Florio, Ardennes Circuit, and Vanderbilt Cup races.
One of the first exhibitions will be an attempt by S. F.
Edge, the English motorist, to maintain a speed of 60
miles an hour for 24 hours, and establish a record of 1440
miles for a day’s travelling. He will use a Dunlop shod 40
h.p. 6-cylinder Napier car. The great motor races involved
an enormous expenditure to get the roads in order, and
immediately the event is decided the money, as far as
motorists are concerned, is lost. Speed-tracks will be
permanent income earners, and reduce the danger not
only to the automobilists, but to the general people.

“Chow” writes: What land game can the
British naval mariner play? Lately a British baby
ironclad put in at an obscure Chinese port, and
when a lonely British resident came on board the
officers suggested that the national game of cricket would
be a fair thing with which to pass away the time and
smash the dreadful monotony. The British person,
whose monotony was even worse than that of the officers,
said enthusiastically that he would find a team some-
where. He couldn’t discover another Briton, but he raked
up two Australians (neither very young), two agile
Frenchmen who had never seen the game in their lives
but who said “ Oui ” when asked to play, two stout,
spectacled German agents who didn’t know cricket from
sausage, but who said “Yah,” and two Swedish sailors,
and then in despair he filled the gap with a pair of
Chinamen. And the British sailor team was beaten by
three runs.

The threat to reconsider the question of bring-
ing out the English XI. scared the Sydney Cricket Ground
Trustees badly. A hasty meeting was held, and, although
the result was kept a close secret, it soon leaked out
that the Trustees proposed to offer the Association
a rebate of 5 per cent, off the 20 per cent, collected, if the
N.S. W. Association should be called upon to make good
any deficit. Understood that the Association will advise
the Board to take to vegetarian diet and stick out for 15
per cent, or nothing. *
The boom in motor-cars is reported to have
reached a sudden end. For months past the factories have
been refusing or lers in France, England and Germany,
and the rules were one-third of price to be deposited
with order, the balance upon delivery. But a change has
come over the spirit of the dream, and various makers
are now offering to the younger sons of the kings of
finance the best of cars on easy time-payment terms.
Writer has been making inquiries among a number of
men who keep motor-cars in Sydney, and the general
reply is that it costs from £5 to £7 per week to support that
kind of vehicle in the Labor-oppressed city. And it is
wonderful what a number of people can afford, in a place
that is ruined by Socialistic legislation, to spend from £5
to £7 per week on a machine carriage.

“J.R.”: It is a curious idea to drive three
motor cars the whole length of Asia and Europe, across
the most impracticable tract of desert on the face of the
globe. The Pekin-Paris race actually means traversing
nearly 3000 miles of country in which there is, from the
sparseness of the population, scarcely any possibility of
getting help in case of emergency. It is, too, a country
that is gradually, but surely, drying up, and the want of
water may be a very serious obstacle. On the whole, the
race ought to be of peculiar interest to people who are
fond of motoring, since it will supply a unique test of the
endurance of the cars engaged. Nowhere else on earth
would it be possible to find a course of such length with-
out high mountains, and it would be equally impossible
to find another 3000-miles course with such long stretches
of sand, and with so little chance of getting a mechanic
to effect repairs. The machines that get through should
be able to go anywhere.

“Polstan”: The fact that the motorist be-
comes sflort-tempered isn’t always to be blamed on the
machine. Let something happen to the cussed motor,
and the silliest crowd on God’s earth happens along and
helps to make matters worse. I had the misfortune to
run out of petrol while going through a township re-
cently (all motorists know that a machine never stops
unless it’s for want of petrol), and while I was fixing the
want up with a spanner and cold chisel from underneath,
the usual crowd collected. “ Gone bung again, Mister'? ”
said a Goth. “ What’s up ; dropped a shoe?” enquired
another Yahoo. This quite upset the crowd, and a blob
of hot oil streaked from the gear-case into my mouth.
Then came the inevitable remark —I was waiting for it :
“ Must get a of a lot o’ vibration on them things ! ”
I threw the spanner at that Hun, and he looked injured
—which, indeed, he was. I crawled out, and while I was
endeavoring to get kerosene into the cylinder, with more
or less success, I venomously eyed a chap who I knew
was about to remark something about “ always goin’
wrong, them machines,” and as soon as he said it I was
going to kill him. The heavy eyes twinkled. “ Here it
comes !” I thought, and I got ready to spring. “If yer
don’t mind, mister, yer’ll be putting in nearly as much as
yer wastin’.” Thunder! Something original. In my
surprise I spilt the rest of the kerosene over my pants,
and the machine flew into such a good humor that it
went off without a buck.

Australian newspapers of June 17 published
cable news of the result of the race for the Kaiser’s Oup,
held at Hamburg on June 15. A most remarkable
feature of this race is that the first five cars were fitted
with Michelin tyres. The Kaiserpreis course measures
about 73| miles round, and is practically the same road
as that used in the Gordon-Bennett Oup race. The
successful competitors had to travel 300 miles, and as the
winner, Nazzaro, on a Fiat car, averaged 54 miles an hour,
some idea can be formed of the terrific speed conditions
of the race.

“ Silas Snell ” : Several Bulletin paragraphers
are satisfied that Bill Squires is an untried pug, and
have endeavored to convince other people that he is
likely to prove very umpty in front of the American
pluggers and skin-shifters. I admit having read their
items with jingoistic ferocity. If Squires is an untried
pugilist, what makes a tried fighter ? He has met every-
body available, and has beaten them all —not merely
beaten them, but eaten them up like biscuits. To con-
tend that the victor over Felix, Starlight, Ruenalf,
Fennessey, Kernick, Williams, Murphy, Smith, and
Mike Williams is an untried man is to cast an as-
persion on the quality of Australian athletes that
must spring from pure gall. Our heavies and middles
are not first-rate men, but several of the men Squires
wiped out so easily are fighters at whom only top-
notchers from anywhere on the landlord’s earth can
afford to cast the supercilious gibe. Bill has been tried
sufficiently to demonstrate that he is a phenomenal fighter
in Australia, and phenomenal Australian fighters have
always hit the other side a solid thump. The expressed
opinion that Willie’s fights under Wren were readied,
starts a wan smile on the faces of his opponents, who
were literally punched out of countenance, and pounded
off their feet by the champion. Men who go into readied
fights don’t bargain for the father and mother of a hiding.
Squires may be a sonk, but if so, his realistic imitation of
an iion fighter is truly marvellous, and has deceived
some of the best judges. My opinion is that he will prove
to be the sonk that moved the world.

“ Waipuki ” : I once struck a Domain
dosser with a sense of humor that was devilish
Walking round Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, I came
on a number of disreputable urchins who were
throwing stones at a battered old slumbering
derelict under a tree. They were very bad
shootists, but at last a healthy mass of road-metal
hit the target, and it rose with a cataract of
vituperation, and gave chase. It was a long
chase, but at last an imp of about seven fell into
the hands of the pursuer. I stood by to effect a
rescue, if necessary, for the ruin had butchery in
his eye. But instead of serving out stoush
the old chap patted the kid on the head, and
spoke kindly. Then he dived one hand into a
pocket, fished out something carefully wrapped
up in paper, pressed it into the child’s hand,
and, with a final pat on the head, walked off
chuckling benignantly. I was surprised at the
ancient’s benevolence, and almost ran after him to
offer him a beer, but before I could commit the
rash wet-brown act the piercing yells of the kid
made me hurry to his aid. Then the mystery was
explained. The aged and horizontal sleeper had
got square. He had given the kid a piece of
tobacco as strong as an elephant, with the assur-
ance that it was a new kind of liquorice, and the
wretched offspring had chewed it real hard.
Another historical Australian spot has
been more or less put out of the reach of the
vandals—462 acres at the top of Mount Du-
maresq (Q.), the peak from which explorer Allan
Cunningham got his first glimpse of the Darling
Downs. Warwick (Q.) Chamber of Commerce is
responsible for the patriotic reservation.
Carruthers to Mayor Hughes’ dinner-
guests :
As Premier of N. S. Wales, and on behalf of the people
of the Mother State, I say the Naval Agreement has
never been unpopular in that State. We can go to sleep
at night knowing that in the morning there will not be
the slightest danger to Australia or Australians.
But can we ? If war were to break out to-morrow,
Australia would, quite likely, find the ships it
relied on—or as many of them as were serviceable
—ordered off (in accordance with the agreement
that makes J. Carruthers feel so safe just now)
to Hong Kong, Bombay, or Singapore, or some
other place where Imperial interests might be
more or less reasonably supposed to be in danger.
The sole judge of that will be someone in London,
who enjoys the confidence of the Admiralty,
That someone may be right in his guess about the
intentions of the real, or supposed enemy, or he
may be wrong, and the attack he has taken our
squadron to guard against may be only a feint,
while the real object is Australia. Why should
we trust an unknown official at Whitehall ? All
African, Australian and Canadian history goes to
show that the Whitehall official in dealing with
oversea affairs is wrong, almost invariably.

When on
your single gear
you toil up that long
ascent—just stop and con-
template the difference had
you a low gear in reserve.
Then “toil ” would be unknown
—you would just “ sail up,” and
what is more, be able to have a
higher gear for the level and the
down hill spin.
THE EADIE
COASTER HUB
gives you these two gears—“lt
makes hill climbing easy”—
further, it makes “Coasting a

shell both variable gear and
back-pedalling brake of absolute
efficiency under all conditions.

Beale Australian Piano
in E/enaissance style, built by us throughout in our own Factories at Annandale, to our own original
designs. We make every detail, including the candelabra, handles, and castors, and thus obtain complete
control of the quality, materials, and workmanship. With Beale-Vader Patent Steel Tuning System,
patented cross-plied woodwork, patent hexagonal bass-strings. Guaranteed to stand all climates.
IN tone, in touch, in tune, in design, in woodwork, metalwork, frame, tuning system, carvings, action, felt, glue, castors, sconces, strings, polish—in every
detail of material, of workmanship, and of system of manufacture, in every attribute, the Beale Australian Pianos are of unsurpassable quality. They are
built throughout on the most up-to-date scientific principles, by thoroughly competent workmen, guided by experienced management. They contain
features which cannot be obtained in any other pianos—patented steel tuning-system, patented cross-plied woodwork, patented hexagonal bass-strings,
patented cast-in hitch pins. The system of manufacture in many respects is far ahead of the practice of the piano makers of Great Britain, Europe, and
America, and in every other respect it is equal. The quality of the materials is the best that money can buy. Then how can there be any better pianos 1
The demonstrable fact is that there are no pianos—German, English, French, American, or any other—even equal to the Beale Australian Pianos. We do not
claim that there are no other high-grade pianos, but we do most emphatically assert that the Beale Pianos, by reason of our patented inventions and our
improved systems of manufacture, are superior to all others, good as some of those others undoubtedly are. Come and see them for yourself. Write for
Catalogue and Circulars. Compare them with all the other pianos you know, see which is superior—and you will decide to buy a Beale.

Underwear of Aertex Cellular in
Wool, Merino, or Heavyweight Cotton, is the safest
and most comfortable form of clothing. We recom-
mend, as most economical, the heavyweight Cotton,

stock the Wool and Merino ; but whichever is used,
the hygienic principle is the same, and the same
beneficial result follows its use.

Mr. C. E. Borchgrevink, the celebrated explorer,
who is about to make another attempt to reach the
South Pole, writes “ Your Aertex Cellular Under-

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.’'

“ Daphne Wandered into the Y.M.C. A.
rooms last Friday, what time the sympathisers
of Mr. W. Winn (who had a slight disagreement
with Mrs. Christina Clark), were circulating the hat
on his behalf. The atmosphere was religious, and
the parson abounded. All hands looked as ruffled
and unhappy and pettish as wet hens. Several
persons testified to the charity, integrity, and
kindliness of William. He did much good by
stealth (it was unfortunate that his remarks
re Mrs. Clark were not by stealth also).
Several gave evidence as to the mulcted
brother’s charitable disposition. Then an-
other arose to tell how their hero could have
made a large sum of money in a business
deal, if he had been willing to break the Sabbath.
But no; he refused to discuss worldly affairs on
the Sabbath (William doesn’t even libel anyone
on the Lord’s Day), and so be lost a large sum of
money. Then a lady gave William £5 on behalf
of the W.C.T. Union. She also expressed great
sorrow for him and for Mrs. Winn. Bruntnell,
M.L.A., donated £2s—his Parliamentary allow-
ance for a month ; after which a gentleman said
one of Winn’s girl employees had offered to give
a week’s salary to assist her good master to pay
the damages. This was told as a proof of the
affection Winn’s employees have for him. Then
the money rolled in till it totalled £426. I’m
satisfied with that blue-ribbon push. I’m going
to join them next time I feel like libelling anyone.
“M.” writes :
Jens Lyng is the author of a worthy book just issued on
the Scandinavians in Australasia. He shows how Green-
land and , America were discovered by Norwegians who
had settled in Iceland. Twenty-five per cent, of the
Scandinavians, including Swedes, Norwegians and Danes,
are in America, which holds 3,000,000 of them. In 1871
there were between 4000 and 5000 in Australasia. By 1881
they had footed up to 14,454, and in 1891 to 21,288. Since
then the immigration of these splendid colonists has
pretty well ceased. The census of 1901 showed a decline
of 190. However, it must be remembered that the Swedes
from Finland are set down as Russians, and the
Danes from Slesvig as Germans. Taking all these
in, with the children born in Australasia of purely
Scandinavian parentage, the total will not be far
short of 50,000. Three Danes, Monrad, Von Mueller
and Knox, have been conspicuous in Australasia.
Monrad, a bishop, was the Danish Premier in 1864, and
refused to surrender without a fight to Prussia and
Austria, in vain reliance on the English blow of Palmer-
ston and Russell (quenched and quashed by Queen
Victoria, according to the recently-published Granville
Memiors), and on the Anglo-French guarantee of the
integrity of Denmark, Denmark became too hot to hold
Monrad, and after the war he emigrated with his family
to Maoriland, haying letters of introduction from Russeil
to Govei;nor Hori Grey. The Monrads settled on the
ManaWatu River. The bishop’s two sons, as military
settlers, took part in the fight against the Maoris. After
three years the bishop returned to Denmark, and re-
covered his bishopric, being also elected a member
of Parliament. His sons stayed in Maoriland, and their
farm of Karere is still held by the family. Von
Mueller, the Melbourne botanist, was of German birth,
but was reared in Denmark, and called himself a Dane.
However, the scene of his childhood became part of
Prussia. After suitably weeping over this, he accepted
the title of Baron from the King of Wurtemburg, and
bloomed into “fool” German, as he would say. E. Knox,
the knight associated with the Colonial Sugar Refining
Co., was born in Hamlet’s Elsinore, educated at the
“ renowned Academy of Soro ” (says Lyng) and commer-
cially trained in Denmark, Germany and England. The
economical writers of America are unanimous that their
North-western States are largely indebted to Scandina-
vians for the marvellous development. They succeed
where Americans With a better start fail. And look at
the all-but unrivalled work of the Scandinavians, as
pioneer settlers in Maoriland, with their settlements of
Norsewood, Halconlbe, Dannevirke, Mauriceville, Maka-
retu, &c. In particular Hawke’s Bay, where all others
shrank from the forest, is a trophy of Scandinavian pluck
and endurance.
It was bound to come —the Sacred Cow..
At the Terang (Vic.) court, last week, Meth
Singh had an action against Buttan of the same
tribe, to recover money alleged to be due to him
(Meth). - The defendant is the ex-champion
wrestler. Discussion arose as to the nature of the
oath to be sworn, counsel for the complainant
contending that the only really binding swear was
that swear which is cussed upon a cow. In the
end, witnesses were given the option of swearing
by the “moo” or by a glass of water, which is
said to be the usual Hindu custom. One witness
preferred the cow :
The cow was brought to the door in full view of the
Bench, and the oath administered. The person to be
sworn grasped the tail of the cow with the left hand, and
held a glass of water in the right. He repeated the form
of oath after the interpreter, and then poured water over
the cow’s tail. The oath interpreted is as follows : —“ I
swear by the head of this sacred animal, the cow, that if
I tell a lie and do not tell the truth, may I become a
leper, and may nothing be left of all belonging to me.”
And then the cow-tail oath having been taken,
the witness, presumably, became as wildly accu-
rate as usual.
There is no danger of croup resulting
seriously if Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is
given.*

over the tongue, and there is never a gap, never a hint of foreign
substance. Purity is, of course, essential to this smoothness and unity of
flavor. The flavor of “ 0.T.” is full and generous, evaporates slowly, and
caresses the whole palate.
Try it with Soda, Lemonade, Water, Wines or Spirits.

Headache, Indigestion and
Constipation.
AN IMPORTANT DISCOVERY.
It will interest sufferers to know
that a valuable medicine, called Froo-
toids, lias been discovered, whicb is
now completely curing each of the
above-named complaints. Frootoids
are elegant in appearance, and plea-
sant to take, and, what is of the ut-
most importance, are thoroughly reli-
able in affording quick relief. You
do hot require to go on taking them
for a prolonged period, as is necessary
with some medicines, Which even then
are mostly disappointing; you simply
take a dose of Frootoids when ill and
repeat the dose if necessary, but gene-
rally one dose is quite effective.
? Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so
far that they not only act as an ape-
rient, but do remove from the blood,
tissues, and internal organs all the
waste poisonous matter that is clog-
ging them and choking the channels
that lead to and from them. The bene-
ficial effects of Frootoids are evident
at once by the disappearance of head-
ache, the head becoming clear, and a
bright, cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly,
and by the food being properly di-
gested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when
Congestion of the Brain or Apoplexy
Is present or threatening. They have
been tested, and have been proved to
afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any
good at all. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that this should be borne ia
mind, for in such cases to take an or-
dinary aperient is to waste time and
permit of a serious illness becoming
fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
antibilious pills make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill
by antibilious pills that could have
been cured at once by Frootoids.
People should not allow themselves to
be duped into contracting a medicine-
taking habit by being persuaded to
take daily doses with each meal of so-
called indigestion cures that do NOT
cure. Frootoids have been subjected
to extensive tests, and have in every
case proved successful in completely
curing the complaints named.
A constipated habit of body will be
completely cured if the patient will on
each occasion, when suffering, take a
dose of Frootoids, instead of an or-
dinary aperient; by so doing, the pa-
tient will require doses only at longer
intervals, and will so become quite
independent of the necessity of taking
any aperient medicine.
Frootoids are only now being placed
on the Australian market, consequently
you may at present have a difficulty
in getting them from your local che-
mist or storekeeper; but ask for them,
and if you cannot get them at once,
send stamps or postal note for price,
1/6, to W. G. Hearne, Chemist, Gee-
long, and a bottle of them will be im-
mediately forwarded to you post free.
Chemists, _ storekeepers, and whole-
salers can now obtain wholesale sup-
plies from W. G. Hearne, Chemist,
Geelong, Victoria.
“ Red Tape Junior ” writes :
N.S.W. public servants, especially those lower down,
are looking askance at the general trend of events, and at
the particular trend of Joe Carruthers. Promotion in the
service above £3OO is a very slow job (not that below that
altitude is any Carrington Handicap), but to all who are
in the habit of receiving the wall-eye of astonishment
when they make an appeal for increase of salary, and the
stone-deaf ear of the Board to hints for transfer to better
billets, 1 there has been the one crumb of comfort —that
those higher up in their own departments must peg out
one daj r or another, and that the man of 43 must get to
65 some time. But the way Carruthers is going on means
closihg this visionary avenue of advancement. First the
Savings Bank people went under a Commissioner named
Macintosh, and promptly a number of the sacked from
that department are drumming their heels on the P.S.B.
mat, waiting for fresh billets. Next, the Lands Depart-
ment is to go the same way, and the Land Tax and the
Income Tax and the Stamp Duties Departments. The
men from these offices are to be chucked on the ample
(I don’t think) bosom of the Board. Also Local Govern-
ment means the annihilation of the Roads and Bridges
Department, and a general clean up among the Works
crowd. Further, some more Departments are going over
to the Commonwealth, which means that a few human
odds and ends will prefer to remain with Ma State and
clamor for other jobs under her. All of which signifies
that there will be a dashed mixed lot of fellows lefl high
and dry, who will have to be provided with billets—
our billets, the dead men’s hoofgear which we are longing
and waiting for. So the Service is not putting in a rather
gay winter, thank you all the same.
“ G. A.L.” from Geelong (Vic.) :
Can you explain this to me ’
About every two months or so our vegetable John
brings around with him a new chum in the shape of an
oily-faced, slit-eyed Chow. Him the aforesaid John
describes as “my olusin. Him just out from China, No
spealcee Englis. Him welly big man in China.”
Now within the past 12 months John has brought
round several of the aforesaid Chinese scum, and what
troubles me is how they get into the country seeing they
cannot speak a word of English, and therefore cannot
pass the education test. “
It is not my fault that any saffron Celestial shouts his
morning cry of “ any wegetable to-day " at our back gate.
Being only a junior in the family I raise my scathing pro-
test in vain.
Constipation
is caused by your bowels becom-
ing weak. This may be due to
general debility or to dosing your-
self with powerful cathartics. The
cure of constipation is not in
dynamiting out the contents of
the bowels, but in strengthening
the walls of the intestines so that
they are able to do the work which
nature intended them to. There
is only one way of building up
the bowels. That way is Reuter’s
Little Pills. They are a bowel
tonic which induces the digestive
juices to flow freely thus enabling
the hundreds of little cells inside
your bowels to absorb the nutri-
tious part of your food and to
eject the waste matter.
Reuter's Soap cures eczema.

BALSAM OF ANISEED
This wonderful Remedy has stood the test for 80 years as the one Safe and Reliable Remedy for
COUGHS, COLDS, ASTHMA, BRONCHITIS,
and all THROAT AND LUNG TROUBLES.
It affords immediate relief and a speedy cure* Read the following proof of its efficacy—
The Revd. Wm. Lush writes from Stixwold Vicarage, Horncastle: —“For the past twelve years I have
been in the habit of using myself, giving away, and recommending your Balsam. I should not be
exaggerating if I said I had never known it to fail. Whenever I have a cough I use it in preference to
aDytning else, and again and again it has cured me.”
Powell’s Balsam of Aniseed has proved itself to be the most effectual remedy for Coughs. Colds,
Bronchitis, etc., etc. A cold nipped in the bud has often saved a life, and there is no surer or safer
preventive from the serious consequences of a neglected cold than a few doses of this excellent prepara*
tion. It should be one of the first aids kept in the house.”— The Gentleman's Journal.

Address: PROF. HENRI DE ASTRO, 360 Bourke Street, Melbourne


Thus Dr. Morris, Chief of Vic. Board of
Public Health :
, There is no doubt, in regard to rabbits, that more con-
sideration is given to the markets abroad than to our
home markets.... Very few first-class rabbits are offered
for sale in the city, and the sooner the public knows it
the better.
That is one of the penalties we pay for being a
debtor nation; but a remedy can be applied in
the shape of adequately protective duties, which
will speedily produce a large local demand, on the
part of highly-paid artisans, for the best the coun-
try can produce. We must, of course, pay our
interest, and, ultimately, the loans themselves,
but a bale of wool manufactured into cloth will
pay off about three times as much as the same
bale in its raw state ; and besides paying off more
indebtedness out of the same quantity of raw
material, it will supply good work and good wages
in the process of manufacture.
Perth is getting a sample of the superior
advantages of Private Enterprise. It handed
over its street tramway rights to the usual foreign
syndicate. Now the syndicate, by refusing con-
cessions to the public, makes 18 per cent, profit
on its capital; and it is using some of the profits
to extend the lines. In other words, Perth is
providing the capital for the extensions, but the
foreign syndicate will own them, and the public
will have to buy them back later on.

E. H. NORTON, Esq., Eucrasy Company, Sydney.
Dear Sir,—As a lifelong Abstainer, a Son of Temperance, and Good Templar, I, for years past, recognised
Drunkenness as a disease, not a crime. When you, in 1896, introduced your Eucrasy Treatment, I became
keenly interested, and recommended it so that I could more closely watch its results. My experience with what
I may term my patients has been such that I can, without any hesitation, testify to its' curative effects, and,
without any soliciting on your part, I give this testimonial, believing sincerely that by so doing I am carrying
out my temperance pledges, “ To do all in my power to advance the Cause.”
I wish you success, for every patient cured adds to the influence the Temperance Party require to enact
Prohibitory laws. You are at liberty to use this testimonial as you deem fit.—Yours sincerely,
W. F. STANTON, J.P.
MISS WELLAND, who cured her father after years
of misery, wretchedness, and almost unbearable
suffering, says : “ I shall be so glad if you publish my
experience, for it will reach many others, and let
them know about the wonderful EUCRASY. I will
do all I can to help any suffering sister who will
write me.”
This Cure for Drunkenness has shed a radiance
into thousands of hitherto desolate firesides. It does
its work so silently and surely that, while the devoted
wife, sister or daughter looks on, the drunkard is re-
claimed without his knowledge.
Mr. JOSEPH KLOSTERMAN, Oobar, N.S.W., savs:
Ifc is eight years ago since I sent for EUCRASY,
and after a lapse of eight years I think a person
should be able to pass his opinion. I am pleased to
say that your medicine has done wonders for me.
I am frequently in the company of smokers and
drinkers, but have no desire myself for either liquor
or tobacco.
If this statement should be of any benefit you
are at liberty to use same for publication, and
remain, Yours thankfully,
(Sgd.) JOSEPH KLOSTERMAN.

CHILD'S AWFUL
SIfMOUH
Screamed with Pain Suffering
Nearly Broke Parent’s Heart —
Twelve Years of Misery —Doctor
Called Case Incurable Helped
from First, and
SPEEDILY CURED BY
CUTICURA REMEDIES
“I wish to inform you that your
wonderful Cuticura has put a stop to
twelve years of misery I passed with
V
my son. As an in-
fant I noticed on
his body a red spot
and treated same
with different rem-
edies for aboutfive
years, but when
the spot began to
get larger 1 put
him under the care
of doctors. Under
their treatment the disease spread to
four different parts of his body. The
longer the doctors treated him the worse
it grew. During the day it would get
rough and form like scales. At night it
would be cracked, inflamed, and badly
swollen, with terrible burning and itch-
ing. When I think of his suffering, it
nearly breaks my heart. His screams
could be heard down stairs. The suf-
fering of my son made me full of misery.
I had no ambition to work, to eat, nor
could I sleep. One doctor told me
that my son’s eczema was incurable
and gave it up for a bad job. One
evening I saw an article in the paper
about the wonderful Cuticura and
decided to give it a trial.
“ I tell you that Cuticura Ointment
is worth its weight in gold; and when I
had used the first box of Ointment there
was a great improvement, and by the
time I had used the second set of Cuti-
cura Soap,Ointment, and Resolvent my
child was cured. He is now twelve
years old, and his skin is as fine and
smooth as silk. Michael Steinman,
Brooklyn, N. Y., April 16, 1905.”

Oatine
r is the great face cream
that is making so
many English com-
plexions clear and
beautiful.
A year ago Oatine was unknown in Eng-
and, now it is used by every woman who
values a good complexion.
Merit alone has built up its enormous popu-
larity. Oatine is a pure face cream, cooling
and refreshing, free from animal fat and
dangerous minerals. It removes the dust
and dirt that soap and water crnnot reach
from the pores, and keeps the skin soft,
delicate and clear. It does not grow hair.
Being made from fresh pure oats, heat does
not cause it to go bad.
It is the ideal face cream for Australians,
and will enable any woman to keep a fresh
clear complexion in the dry Australian
climate. Men use it after shaving.
In jars 1/9, or large size, four times the
amount, 3/6.
To be obtained at all chemists,
stores, etc., throughout Australia.

The Inky Way.
Something specially foolish in English cartoons was
published in Mrs. Clement Scott’s paper, The Free
Lance, the other week. A shockingly bad drawing, en-
titled “ The Dog in the Manger,” represents a dog with a
spiked collar round its neck, standing in a basin (or
manger) marked “Disarmament." The animal’s collar
Proclaims it to be Germany, so the picture means, in
effect, though not in purpose, that Germany has gone in
for “ Disarmament,” and will not allow any other dog to
share the luxury. Seemingly the significance of a
Cockney chatter-paper cartoon lies in the misunder-
standing of it.
* * » *
According to a paragraph that is going the rounds in
England, the Servian Inky Way must be a strenuous
path. The story goes that the publication of
a Belgrade daily was suspended by law ; but, its
term of compulsory non-publication being over, it
started afresh. During the first ten days of its new
career four issues of the paper were confiscated, the editor
was sentenced to a month in gaol, the printers were all
arrested, and the oliice-boy was exiled. The alleged exile
of the office-boy rather overstrains an otherwise promis-
ing and fairly-plausible lie.
* * • *
“ Vag ”: You couldn’t go far through the “ Inky Way”
in Westralia without hearing something about Mclntyre,
proprietor and (sometimes) editor of the Southern Cross
Times,, “Mac” first started prospecting about 13 years
ago, then turned-to as an off-sider at the Cool-
gardie _ Government Hospital, and eventually blos-
somed into a chemist, hanging out his shingle at the
Cross. As a recreation, he started the Times in an aban-
doned undertaker’s shop, where Theophilus Snook had
made his money out of the corpse-planting industry.
During a dull period recently that same Snook, resenting
a funeral joke which appeared in the Times, pulled his
ad. out, and the disgusted Mclntyre expressed his
opinions in a notable article entitled “ Snivelling Snook.”
Many editors have come and gone, some violently, some
amicably, since the inception of the Times. One was dis-
charged through the post-office, which was the medium
of communication between proprietor and editor for over
a month, owing to strained relations. At last the con-
tumacious ink-slinger made disrespectful allusion to the
boss’s pill-factory over the way, and that settled it.
“ Mac ” wrote the next leader himself. ,

The girleen who hasn’t so far been able to find a market
for her little wattle poems, moves shyly up to the door of
the Austral Literary Association, which has started to
advertise that it will place literature of merit upon the
market. Then, first of all, the association puts its cir-
cular into the girleen’s hand, and she sees that if she pays
10s. Cd. she may bombard the association with as many
wattle poems as she likes for three months ; but any
precise information about the association’s market is as
hard to get as the half-guinea. True, the association,
having men of great experience at its head, will polish
up the wattle poem and the article “On the Efficacy
of Doors as a Means of Escape.” According to the
circular in the girleen’s hand: —
“ Subscribers to this agency, therefore, will have the
twofold advantage of having any technical errors of
composition, due to inexperience, rectified (if desired)
before being submitted, and have their work placed to
the best possible advantage.”
And the director and the secretary sign the circular as
a guarantee, no doubt, that that' is the sort of polish
they will put (for 10s. 6d. a quarter) upon the surface
of unrecognised genius.
* * * *
Sydney Telegraph, of June 4, complained resentfully
that the English Educational Conference had implied
that Australian daily papers might, with advantage, be
better informed on European politics. “We are very
well informed,” it said, and threw a chest. But a few
days before, while trying to give the French for
“ sardines in oil,” it inflicted on its readers “ sardines Ala
de huile,” and on June 10 it showed-a gross ignorance of
not European but Australian politics and facts. In a
leader on the income-tax cases and the High Court, it
said, inter alia :
“ Mr. Justice Isaacs held that no constitutional point
had been raised by the appeal to the Privy Council.”
(Justice Isaacs held no such thing. What he did hold
was that the first decision of the High Court was at fault,
but since it was a Constitutional issue the High Court
decision had to stand.) Further
“ It is apparent that if this latest interpretation of the
Commonwealth powers stands good, the consequences to
the States may hereafter be very great. If at any time
the Commonwealth should take over any further func-
tions now administered by the States, all the officials
would rise superior to State taxation, and the question
arises whether, if the State ceases to have the power to tax
them, it does not at the same time lose the power to con-
trol them in any way ? The Commonwealth seeks
to take over the State debts to the amount of 41240,000,000,
and in that case all incomes derived therefrom would at
once be freed from State taxation.”
That is sheer absurdity. How could a bondholder be
counted as a servant? The Telegraph should re-con-
sider the position. Does it not need education ?
* * • «
The shadow of the hearse and the tall hat with a black
band lies heavy on the soul of the country newspaper
editor. John Staggs, alive (and a subscriber), might not be
much, but Staggs dead is a very serious defunct person,
and a journalistic perplexity. Departeds like Staggs have a
habit of being “ survived ” by a number of sons and
married daughters (some of whom are subscribers) and
brothers and sisters (also subscribers). The task of sort-
ing out the “ relatives of deceased ” and ticketing
them without error is, therefore, one not lightly to be
entered upon. The undertaker is cheerfully informative,
and the oldest inhabitant can be depended on for a
grain of information amid much unbagged chaff of re-
miniscence, as to deceased’s career on this planet. The
interviewing of “ bereaveds,” especially females, is likely'
to result in a damp shirt-front and a disarranged tic,
rather than in any coherent story. Having placed the
relatives for 16 miles around with mathematical accuracy
(for the quick are of more importance than the dead), the
defunct himself, who has probably died as the result of a
prolonged “jag,” is next dealt with. In such cases very
careful and tactful treatment is required, and adjectives,
such as “ mournful,” “ sad,” and “melancholy,” are
liberally dropped into the copy, which finally concludes
with a' reference to the profound gloom that hangs
over the whole staff, and the township, and the sur-
rounding cow-farms. Sometimes, in a moment of
enthusiasm, the paper tries to state that we ne’er shall
look upon his like (the comp, makes it “bike”) again.
The reporter must be watched to see that he marries the
deceased Staggs to the first Mrs. Staggs in the right year ;
otherwise confusion, riot and dismay gather round the
birth certificate of the elderly Misses Staggs. And, despite
all possible care, there is always the chance that The
Battler will give Staggs a “ stick ” more than The Yell,
and desolate.itself more completely, and be buried in
deeper gloom. And the total recompense of the prudent
and circumspect editor is probably the sale of a dozen
extra copies, and the withdrawal by Boggs of his two-
inch advt. because the wreath that Boggs sent to Staggs’
grave was overlooked.
A never-failing grievance with the country pressman is
caused by rhe unblushing cheek of that awful sweater,
the Country Newspaper Proprietor, in possessing himself
of theatre tickets and expecting the reporter to bustle in
on the nod. If the Proprietor happens to have a remnant
of decent feeling about usurping the press privileges, his
missus and the kids haven’t, and the 305.-a-week reporter,
who wants to take his girl to the show, has either to pay
or cringe to the chief bounder at the ticket office.

Oh, the saints may' scoff at the beery bards, and the min-
strels who sing of booze ;
We travel the road we have to go, and that’s not the road
we’d choose;
The jargon of ’Change and the hucksters’ cries are Greek
to the ears of us ;
Time is for slaves, and we have been free since the day we
lost the ’bus.
Let them blindly rush o’er the precipice in their lust for
an empire wide,
But we’ll recline on the soft brown sands that stretch
where we missed the tide.
And we’ll watch the struggling Men Who Do, nor grieve
that of them we are rid,
P or that porcine crew is the Men Who Do, and we are the
Men They Did.

the organs acted upon. It is so* agreeable in

“Mallet” from not very far back in
Westralia :
I want to back Westralia against any of the other States
for insect pests. First, in the fly line, we have more
varieties than are found elsewhere. They come at differ-
ent times, so that one will not feel lonely while the
other breeds are away. In summer we have the ordinary
housefly. In spring, March flies and kangaroo flies (a
particularly vicious breed, smaller than house flies, and
which draw blood every time they get a fair bite). In
winter there are sand flies, mosquitos and blow flies ; in
autumn, March flies again. These are regulars, and there
are some besides which come only occasionally, such as
the soldier fly, dragon fly, &c. In the ant line we have
all the known species, and a few others. On taking
down the sugar tin to-day, 1 found no fewer than five
different varieties therein. The flying ants which come out
before and after rain are a particular curse. We have all
sizes and varieties of centipedes, scorpions, &c., and some
of the latter are particularly poisonous. Our special curses,
however, are known as “ cocktails”—little black insects
with terra-cotta heads, somewhat like an ant. These are
to be found at the foot of most trees having rough bark,
and when squeezed emit a thick, creamy matter, which
is very virulent. A person, on being “ inoculated,”
generally proceeds at once to wash the poisoned spot,
which is the worst thing he can do, as it. only spreads the
poison. The appearance of the affected part is that of a
burn or scald. Deaths have been even recorded from
cocktail-bite. What with spiders and other families of
pests too numerous to mention, I have come to the
conclusion that a man in Westralia cannot work in the
bush and be a Christian.
Sydney tram revenue has increased from
£438,668 in 1901 to £730,500 in 1906. It’s one of
the consequences of Federation. The dejected
and outraged people spend much of their time
aimlessly seeking to get out of the Union per tram.

WHY DRUGS FAIL
AND ELECTRICITY CORES!
3*
DRUGS cure acute diseases because the latter are of poisonous origin,
and the poison in drugs counteracts or neutralizes the poison
in the body. They fail to cure ehronie diseases
OP make Strength, as you who have tried them know. Chronic
ailments are caused by depletion of the nerve tissues, lack of recreation,
of fresh air and of exercise, the non-assimilation of food, and often by
excesses in eating, drinking and numerous other excesses and violations
of the laws of Nature which result in weakness of the various organs.
It goes without saying that the taking of poison into the body will not, cannot
cure these conditions, for poisons do not give nourishment.
What must be the means of cure ? It certainly must be something which
replaces and reinstates the lost or wasted vitality. It must be a natural element of
the body, not an unnatural one. No one will claim that poisons are natural elements
of the human body, for it revolts every time they are taken. An experience of
more than twenty years with drugs and Electricity has convinced us that
Electricity alone, without any other material aid, will replace and renew lost energy
and vitality. Thousands of grateful letters from cured people tell us that drugs
failed to cure, and that Electricity, as given by the new improved
dr. McLaughlin s electric belt
is the only successful means of cure. These people will tell you they have been cured by OUP Belt of Weak-
ne s, Baekaehe, Rheuma'isra, Sciatica, Stomach Troubles, and Liver and Kidney
Ailments after spending large sums ot money fruitlessly in drugs and other treatments. Electricity cured them by
exercising the relaxed nerves, muscles and organs and putting back into them the element which was lost, and which
is the foundation of strength. . . . Ours are the original and standard Electric Belts of Australasia, and our
price is as low t S £1 in many cases.

Business, Robbery, etc.
Who says the Australian isn’t business-like ? A

N.S.W. cow expert O’Callaghan, at a recent
conference of butter factory managers at Kiama (N.S. W.),
made a few references to the results of the Commerce
Act which were, in themselves, a complete answer to the
carping criticisms that still appear in the commercial
press. O’Callaghan informed the managers that in
future they must not put “ finest creamery ” on the
butter boxes, and any old butter inside, as used to be the
frequent practice. Nor must they mark 561 b. on the out-
side of the box, and put less than 551 b. inside, as was
done with a recent consignment of 100 cases. It was a
surprise to him, said the State cow expert, to find
on examination that a considerable number of the scales
in the local factories weighed short. In fact, O’Callag-
han’s reminders of what the factory managers must stop
doing would indicate that the state of the butter ex-
port trade alone demanded the passage of the Com-
merce Act.

“Janor”: The cocky has had a good many
turns recently, and deservedly so, for the length of his
working day and the shortness of the pay therefor. Now
it is up to the country storekeeper, who is just as big a
sweater as the cocky, to come into the limelight. There
are plenty of storekeepers in Vic. who live a life of ease,
and flash about in buggies, etc., on the labor of a few
youths, who do men’s work for boys’ pay, and toil from 12
to 16 hours per day. One case of many I know of : Young
man, 20 years of age, first-rate butcher and slaughterman,
good counter-hand, expert packer, groom and driver,
works from daylight fg,r into the night at these Jobs, drives
a delivery cart, and "every now and then does a bit of
droving, bringing in a mob of cattle. Wage for the lot is
10s. per week and tucker. Badly indeed is the Factories
Act needed to shake up the country storekeeper and
compel him to pay a fair wage.
* * * *
Absolutely the worst-paid work in the N.S.W.
factories where much female is employed, is dressmak-
ing ; for girls under 18 the average pay got down to 3s.
7d. a week in 1903, and it is only a few pence better now.
Even for the young women of 18 and over the average
pay in the year of the 1905 boom harvest was only 19s.
lid. Tailoresses do better; they average PI ss. 8d. —the
best average for any large number of adult female opera-
tives. Florists pan out at £1 Bs. ; but there are not
man}' of them. Next to the tailoresses come the slop-
clothing employees with £1 os. lOd. per week (this is for
adults), though bedding-makers earn a trifle more.
Tobacco operatives average £1 os. 6d., which is eighteen-
pence ahead of boot operatives. Down right at the
bottom of the list—if there was a list, which there isn’t
—is the Lizzie in the pickle factory ; 9s. 6d. a week is the
18-year-and-over average, and apparently it has never
been more than 10S. 9d. That is worse even than the
white-work slave, who makes Society’s elaborate under-
frillies for 12s. lOd. a week when she’s grown up, and
6s. 4d. a week when she still has her hair a-hanging down
her back.

The astounding robbery of £l7OO from the Mel-
bourne Mint is another commentary on the farce of
auditing. Senior-constables, or other officers, came round
at all sorts of hours in the night, and looked at the out-
side of the safe, whereupon its contents were pronounced
all right. Exactly the same as the auditing of certain
institutions —for instance, that auditing under which
treasurer Dickson robbed Melbourne University of
£26,000. The auditors —two retired and heavily-pen-
sioned potentates of .the civil service, appointed because
they kindly agreed to oblige by doing it on the cheap—
came regularly, looked at the outsides of documents, and
said “ All Right.” The case is the same as where a stage
banker hands over £lO,OOO in notes, which the other man
immediately pockets, without counting them. And he
also says “ All Right."

Seventy years- ago one Henry Howey, who had
a small vegetable garden near Sydney, went to town to
sell his “ turmuts.” Having finished his business, he
called on a land-agent and learnt that there was shortly to
be a sale of land in the new town of Melbourne. Howey
asked his agent to bid for allotments 17 and 18 in Collins-
street, and No. 19 on the corner of Swanston-street. No.
17, with a frontage to Collins-street of 66ft., running
right through to Little Oollins-street, cost £2O. No. 18,
of the same dimensions, cost £29. For the corner block,
No. 19, having 132 ft. frontage to Collins-street, and ex-
tending exactly halfway down Swanston-street towards
Little Collins-street, Howey’s agent paid £45. So the
three blocks, covering an acre and a half, were bought
for £94. Within three years of buying the land Henry
Howey and his family were drowned at sea, and his
brother John took over the turnip farm and the deeds for
the three Melbourne allotments. John went energetically
into the production of turnips, but was disturbed one
day by a letter from Melbourne asking what he wanted
for the land, or for a building lease of it. Several letters
then arrived from different people who wanted a lease of
the land. Old John Howey made them all tender for a
building lease of 21 years, and let it to the highest bidders,
who had to put up and maintain buildings of a certain
value. As the years rolled by the shops became Howey’s,
and he quadrupled the rents, which amount, it is said, to
£40,000 a year. John Howey went to England, lived in a
baronial hall, and died in 1871, leaving his property to
John Howey, junior, a major of something or other. In
1888 the Howey estate in Collins-street was valued at
£890,000. In 50 years a £94 investment increased to
nearly a million sterling, by unearned increment and
through the care of the Government of Victoria and the
City Council of Melbourne. The Howeys have for very
long been absentees from Australia, and public policy
seems to demand that their estate should be specially
taxed through a special Act of Parliament, as representing
a case that is worse than the average.
Summarising Protected America s commanding
position in steel manufacture to-day, Munsey’s Magazine
for April gives a few illuminating particulars : —“ We can
sell steel billets, delivered in Great Britain, for sixteen
dollars and a half a ton —two dollars fifty-nine cents (Us.
2|d.) cheaper than the present British price. The labor-
cost of iron per ton in Pittsburg is 41 cents (Is. 81-d.), as
against 72 cents (35.) in England, although Pittsburg
wages are double those of Sheffield (Eng.). Yet it is only
a century since not a pound of iron was made in Ohio—
since Pittsburg was a frontier village, without a rolling-
mill or a bank—since Jefferson wrote to his friend, John
Adams : ‘We cannot make iron in competition with
Sweden or any other foreign country.’ ”

“Agricola”: Re “Mel” (B. 9/5/’O7) and his
complaint of the difficulty of procuring locally-made
hoof-gear in Sydney shops. I cannot speak of the Syd-
ney emporiums, but I gladly bear witness that in the
bush general stores the opposite is the case. Here, 300
miles from Sydney, our local universal provider
stocks scarcely anything but Australian boots, and,
moreover, he wears them himself to provide a clinching
argument in their favor. We buy them, because we
find ic pays best. Last year I bought a pair of Sydney-
made hoof-cases at 10s. 6d., while my mate (who was
mashing a girl) indulged in a pair of radiant Americans
at 18s. 6d. Since then I have worn out three pairs of
half-soles on my r investment, and he is just entering on
the second pair of half-soles on his Australian
boots. The gorgeous Americans went to their quarter-
earned rest in the old quarry months ago. The sewing
came undone, and the false kid cracked. We bush-
whackers wear Parramatta tweeds through the week,
and Marrickville on Sunday', and boast of the time they
last us. Moreover the shopkeeper who made the remarks
which “ Mel ” complains of about Australian goods would
get smitten on the nose up here.

Recognising that the business-man is probably
the most ignorant person in the community, Sydney
University has set about educating him. The establish-
ment of a department of Economics and Commerce is a
popular move in the direction of broadening those steps
to the University about which Jordan has been speaking
through his nose. The lectures have been “ rushed.”
In It. F. Irvine’s class upon economics there is an atten-
dance of 80 students, comprising young men from banks,
insurance offices, mercantile firms, and the Civil Service,
as well as a large sprinkling of men who have already
reached the top of their professions—insurance managers,
and accountants in big practices. Jordan says that in
some towns in America no man can get a billet in an
office unless he is a university graduate; and statistics
show that men from the colleges reach higher posi-
tions than those who are put upon a stool imme-
diately after leaving school. It would be a desirable
change if the business man of Sydney knew something
about his business. Mostly all he knows is how to add
up figures and play Bridge.

“Itan”: The day when Australia will regret
its ruthless slaughter of timber is already within sight.
Although Queensland has 40,000,000 acres of timber lands,
and the only considerable supply of hoop pine, it is now
calculated that the hoop pine will give out in 15 years.
The butter export to London absorbs no less than
100,000 ft. every fortnightly shipment from Brisbane
alone. As it takes 80 years for this timber to mature,
and the Australian demand is growing every year, the
butter people will have to look round for some other
butter box. The cedar supply is now almost a
thing of the past; the scrub lands of North
Queensland are the only remaining source. And the
destruction up there in the past has been shock-
ing. Many giant trees were felled which could not be
removed. You can see pictures of some of these wantonly
slaughtered mammoths in the N.Q. hotels. Twenty years
ago, as an instance of this vandalism, some millers
endeavored to get out a large quantity of cedar at the
back of Oairns, so as to economise in the shipping. To
escape the long haulage, they were to shoot it down the
range’s precipitous face—2oooft. at least. Once at the
foot, they could easily get the logs dragged to the Mul-
grave River, on which they could be rafted to the sea.
Many were the logs that were hauled to the crest of a spur,
but it was then found that the timber was shattered and
splintered in the descent. So tens of thousands’ worth
of red cedar was left to rot. Some of it remains there
yet, although it is all more or less on the journey back to
earth. A recent fire has hastened the funeral.

“ Hassan ” : A storm in an egg-cup. I accom-
panied, for my sins, a damsel into a draper’s shop, the
other day. The quest was velvet, and the velvet expert
showed piles of different-colored varieties to his
customer. His eagle eye caught sight of a scrap that an
unskilful assistant had cut in a heterodox manner. He
called another expert, and the two became very bitter
and sarcastic at the expense of the unknown cutter.
After a couple of minutes, they called up the shop-
walker, and the ears of the man who had committed the
crime must have tingled. “ They drag a fellow from the
plough,” said the first expert, “ and set him at the velvet
counter.” I suggested that perhaps the murderer might
have been an artist or a poet, or some other such lowly kind
of tradesman, and the shop-walker seemed quite struck
with the idea. After five more minutes of wasted time,
the damsel asked the price of the piece. “ I don’t like to
sell it,” replied the expert. “ I think I’ll keep it as a
curiosity.” But pressed, he admitted that 10|d. would
secure the horror. “ There’s at least ljd. wasted,” he
said, gloomily, and the shopwalker and the other expert
frowned heavily. “ Shall I wrap it up for you, miss?”
I have a high opinion of the courage of women. This one
explained quite calmly that she didn’t want the mutilated
corpse ; she had only asked the price from curiosity,
whereupon we left the three velveteers ,o their grief.
Three large men almost in tears over ljd. ! The drapery
trade is truly a broadening and inspiring profession.

A circular in the alleged British language, from
a piano firm in Naples, in the country that artist Datillo-
Rubbo comes from : —“ We have the honour of making you
known, to have transferred our secular work-shop N. 32
&33 S. Ohiara-street, enlarging it and arranging it in a
way, as to answer with the greatest quickness to the con-
tinual demands, which, owing to the universal esteem,
come to us from all parts of the world. We have re-
marked, however, to the greatest, regret of our Sowl,
that a great number of insatiable speculators, in all the
spots of the globe, offer as products of the House
Vinaccia, instruments with etiquette and our false signa-
ture, deceiving in such a way the public, to which they
let it know as made in our work-shop, honoured by the
increasing esteem feverishly attested over two Centuries.
For this reason, whilst we are doing our utmost to strike
unmercifully such thieves, we take the liberty to fix your
attention, requesting you to publish this as much as you
can. We are certain of your cooperation, and we thank
you for your kind benevolence in this business. We re-
main, yours respectfully,—Flli. Vinaccia fu Basque. &

“L.E.” : Examined a Sydney shop that declared
in loud signs that it’s food was Fresh. Fresh !! There
grinned English partridge, English g-rouse, Canadian,
Cheddar, Dutch, Dago, High (very High) German, and
other breeds of cheese ; Boston beans and pork ; German
saveloys and Frankfurts ; Scotch haddocks and salmon ;
Devonshire cream, Russian caviare, English turbot, Nor-
wegian “Kramsfiigel,” York ham, Trieste olives, and a
dozen other culinary delicacies made “fresh” by a six
weeks’ ocean blow for the benefit of their health. The
habitat of these wild fish and cheese and fowl was boldly
displayed ; and nothing seemed particularly ashamed,
except one retiring section of modest Lieberwurst. This
Imported Seram Emporium needed only to import its
salt from the Dead Sea to set up an “All Foreign ” din-
ner worthy of the august bingy of the most anti-Austra-
lian merchant in New South Wales.

“Yes,” said the retail lolly man, “the sweets
that are manufactured in Australia have, with Freetrade
customers, to be ‘ pushed.’ But there are different
methods of ‘pushing.’ For instance, I get a box of
English-made ’jubes. When they are sold, I place the
locally-made ’jube in the empty English box. They bring
double prices, and the Freetraders pay twice the money
for the article which they formerly despised. A friend of
mine, having a dead line of chocolate sticks, placed them
in the sun, and when they softened slightly, stamped on
them, with lead type, an English maker’s name. Result,
quick sale. I have held with Protection ever since I
bought an imported line of ‘ Finest Almond Toffee,
Guaranteed Pure.’ In breaking a portion for sale, I
placed one of the almonds in my mouth, and, not recog-
nising the taste, I broke more toffee and examined the
fruit. I could have smitten four importers dead at a
blow when I discovered that the * Finest Almonds ’ were
pumpkin seeds ! ”
FROM AN EASTERN BALCONY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a weird, familiar fragrance floating down the
western breeze,
Like the scent of drifted seaweed on the marge of beaches
white,
Like the sad, strong smell of sheep-works when the jum-
bucks fail to freeze,
Or the carcase-odor calling from the creek-bed to the
kite.
I have breathed a thousand attars from a thousand
blooming trees,
That call me to the forest, to the life I love the best,
But the scent most strange and wondrous ranges down
our balconies,
When the wind blows up from Footscray—out o’ Foots-
cray in the west.
I have smelt the warm, wild smell of dogfish, stranded
high and dry,
Above the shining reaches where the restless breakers
beat;
And the dry tanks in the drought-time, where the flocks
came down to die ;
The stench of briny greenhide, stacked and steaming in
the heat;
I have met the deathless odors of the store at Monday’s
Flat,
And of blood-manures out drying—but the fiercest smell
I know,
Transcending- all the perfumes of the grim reducing-vat,
Comes rolling in from Footscray, when the western
breezes blow.
The red gums in the gardens sigh and murmur in the
night;
They wake dim memories of creeks that babbled in the
shade,
Of gullies green, of dustless days, and nights of pure
delight,
And all those lovely tracks where once we wandered with
a maid.
But when the night slips onward, and the wayward
breezes change,
The scented breath of summer in the gardens is sup-
pressed ;
A swift and simple dreadfulness, an incense, strong and
strange,
Rides down the wind from Footscray—out o’ Footscray,
in the west.

REMARKABLE
INVENTION
FOR THE
CULTURE
OF HAIR
CHE EVANS VACUUM CAP is a practical invention constructed on scientific and
hygienic principles, by the simple means of which a free and normal circulation
is restored throughout the scalp. The minute blood vessels are gently stimulated
to activity, thus allowing the food supply, which can only be derived from the blood,
to be carried to the hair roots, the effects of which are quickly seen in a healthy, vigorous
growth of hair. There is no rubbing, and as no drugs or chemicals of whatsoever kind
are employed, there is nothing to cause irritation. It is only necessary to wear the Cap
three or four minutes daily.
60 DAYS’ FREE TRIAL!
The Company's Guarantee*
An EVANS VACUUM CAP will be sent you for sixty days’ free
trial. If you do not see a gradual development of a new growth of hair,
and are not convinced that the Cap will completely restore your hair, you
are at liberty to return the Cap with no expense whatever to yourself. It
is requested, as an evidence of good faith, that the price of the Cap be
deposited with the Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Company of London, the
largest financial and business institution of the kind in the world, who will
issue a receipt guaranteeing that the money will be returned in full, on
demand, without questions or comment, at any time during the trial period.
The eminent Dr. I. N. LOVE, in his address to the Medical Board on the subject of Alopaecia (lAs of
hair) stated that if a means could be devised to bring- nutrition to the hair follicles (hair roots), without
resorting to any irritating process, the problem of hair growth would be solved. Late* An, when
the EVANS VACUUM CAP was submitted to him for inspection, he remarked that the cap would
fulfil and confirm in practice the observations he had previously made before the Medical Board.
Dr. W. MOORE, referring to the invention, says that the principle upon which the Evans Vacuum
Cap i 3 founded is absolutely correct and indisputable.
An illustrated and descriptive book of the Evans Vacuum Cap will be sent , post free, on application

The Kidnapping of Brody.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sun had set, and the curlews were
making weird melody on the thickly-
timbered ridges across the Logan, when
Brody drove up to Gater’s. He had left town in
the morning half sprung ; he had departed from
Dulla station late that afternoon, three-quarters
sprung; and when he resumed his homeward
journey from Gater’s pub that night he had to be
assisted into his buggy. He was still a straight-
laced, dignified gentleman ; the only ludicrous
thing about him in his lapses was his studied
effort to appear sober. They all knew him along
the road, and the women at every house watched
interestedly from door and window as he rattled
past. They judged his condition according to his
pace. If he was driving steadily, he was pretty
sober; if he was driving hard, he was pretty full;
and if he was driving furiously and singing, he
was as drunk as a lord. Nor was this his limit.
He got blind drunk at times, when he tore down
gates, barked trees, and got bumped out over logs.
These lapses occurred only when John Brody
paid his periodical visits to town, where he some-
times sat on the Bench, and reproved the common
herd for being drunk and disorderly, and fined
them five bob—decorated with the option.
While he talked with Gater in the bar, Tarkal-
son, Scully, Murty Brown, and Jim, who was
nicknamed Webster, were talking of him in the
next room.
“ He’s mean enough, that man, to skin a flea
for its hide,” said Tarkalson. “If he ken get out
of payin’ his men’s wages on a technicality, or
any blamed shuffle at all, he’ll do it—an’ him
worth thousands. He did me an’ Scully in for
our beans because we ’adn’t a leg sound enough to
stand on in court. He’s studied law for that
special, I think.”
“In law parlance,” said Jim, “ the case was ex
parte, and you had no locus standi.”
“ What’s that ? ”
“ Briefly,” said Jim, “the claim was for skins
and scalps delivered for you by blacks, who had
previously been hunting for themselves. They
represented the goods as their own, and received
the emoluments. When you transpired subse-
quently, your claim was rejected with contumely
and other natural products ; and you had no re-
dress against the dusky fraternity because you
had no license to employ them.”
“ Eggs-ackly,” said Scully.
“But I’ve found out since that he didn’t pay
th’ blacks more’n a fiver altogether,” said Tarkal-
son. “Nobody knows th’ justice of our claim
better ’an Brody, an’ he’ll admit in his own heart,
when we bring him to book, that he deserved
what he got. What’s sauce for the goose is sauce
for th’gander.”
“ Precisely,” said Jim, “though the application
of the sauce is not exactly similar.”
“That isn’t necessary,” Tarkalson declared.
“We can’t afford to mince matters an’ be mealy-
mouthed in dealin’ with a man that’s on th’ crook.
We’ve tried all fair means, an’ it’s been no go.
So we must put th’ screw on him. An’ we’ll know
nothing after, just as he pretends to know nothing,
you understand ? ”
“ I comprehend,” Jim responded.
“Th’ principal thing is to work together, so as
not to give him a pull on us.”
“Succinctly,” said Jim, “you want me and
Mr. Brown to kidnap the gentleman, so that you
and Mr. Scully can claim a ransom without in-
criminating yourselves ? ”
“Something like that,” Tarkalson admitted.
“If you do as I say, there’ll be no hitch.”
“I don’t hold with them proceeding,” Murty
objected. “They’re unlawful.”
“ Y’r needn’t be afraid, Murty,” Scully assured
him. “ He’ll be too drunk to ’urt y’r.”
“’Tain’t that; it’s wot ’ill ’appen if we’re
bowled out,” Murty explained. “ Kidnappin’th’
owner of Crowlong will make a mighty big stir in
this country, let me tell yer.”
“Might do the country good,” said Tarkalson.
“It wants stirrin’ up.”
“A J.P., too ! ” Murty went on.
“The bigger the game the greater the thrill,”
Jim put in.
“Damn th’ thrill!” snapped Murty. “I like
a quiet life meself.”
“Shugh!” said Scully, “ I only wish I could
go.”
“I only wish yer could,” Murty returned.
“’S a pity to do yer out of a little enjoyment like
that.”
Scully winked at Tarkalson, and left the. room.
Jim rang the bell for Mrs. Gater. When she had
brought in the drinks, she said, indicating the
bar : “ Doin’ in a cheque with the flies.”
“Must be purty tight now,” said Tarkalson,
carelessly. “Shouldn’t wonder if something
’appens him goin’ home.”
“He’s got a good quiet team,” Mrs. Gater
answered, “though that isn’t much to depend on
when whisky’s driving.”
“ I s’pose he’s purty helpless when he’s drunk ?”
Murty enquired.
“Don’t you believe it,” Mrs. Gater replied,
airily. “He can get around now, an’ he’s got a
good idea what he’s doing, though he may be as
full as a tick.”
Murty chewed that over very seriously, and he
didn’t like the taste of it.
When she had left them, Scully returned,
carrying several straps, a bag, and four pieces of
sheepskin. He threw two of the latter to Jim,
and himself tied the other two round Murty’s feet.
“Keep on th’ grass,” Tarkalson enjoined, as
they set out, “ an’ don’t drag yer feet.”
* *
A mile and a-half from Gater’s there was a
double gate, and two miles off the road from this
spot, and across a scrubby hill, there was an
empty hut in a small paddock. It was never
visited by travellers, and had, therefore, been
considered the safest and most efficient repository
for the person of John Brody, Esq., J.P.
At this double gate, behind a bush, waited the
kidnappers.
Brody drove up full tilt, and stopped with a
jerk that staggered him in his seat. He talked
to himself gutturally for awhile, then got down,
and led his horses through. As he closed
the gates again, and was fumbling with the catch,
he was suddenly enveloped in the cavernous
mouth of a three-bushel bag. His involuntary
roar, and the bump he gave the gate in his first
leap for liberty, startled the horses. As these
had to be retained to ensure success, Jim ran
after them, leaving Murty to hold the bag on.
Murty fought the battle of his life with that
bag ; but Brody was a strong man, and he threw
him off repeatedly, and seriously damaged the
gate with him. Murty closed with him again,
and in the tussle that ensued he lost his moccasins,
and got his feet badly trampled. Then the bag
came off, and the big man’s fists got full play.
They played on Murty’s jaw, they whizzed
against his ear, banged into his neck, and rattled
against his ribs. Murty, gasping and groaning,
and bleeding at both ends, was sparring despe-
rately for wind when Jim returned and tripped up
the human cyclone. Murt.y would have liked to
express his opinion on kidnapping at this stage,
but he was under a pledge of silence until the job
was completed.
Having secured their prize with straps, and
drawn the_ bag over his head again, and Murty
having recovered his hat and his moccasins, and
drawn a bush several times over the scene of the
fight, they lifted John Brody into the buggy and
drove off to the hut. On the way, Murt.y, who
had acquired a thirst and a lot of dust in his
throat, explored the vehicle, and, finding a bottle,
applied a liberal portion of its contents to his
wounded feelings.
By the time they reached the hut, Brody was
asleep. Getting him out in that condition was
awkward and laborious. Consequently they
dropped him in the process. Brody woke, swore
voluminously, and, after giving them ten years
each for assault and battery, evinced a desire to
go to sleep again. They sat him comfortably in a
canvas chair, which he had brought from town,
lashed him securely to it, and locked him in the
hut. The horses were turned loose in the pad-
dock, and the buggy run in among some bushes
behind the hut. Then they started back across
the bush to the pub.
As soon as they had got out of earshot of the
prisoner, Murty exploded.
“By cripes, Jim, you’re th’ two ends an’ th’
middle of a double-barrelled idiot ! No mistake
about it.”
“What’s your speciality in disturbances now?”
asked Jim.
“Look at me!” Murty cried, pathetically.
“ I’m marked enough to be identified.”
“ That’s not a delectable condition, I’ll allow,”
said Jim. “But the minor protuberances and
contusions and abrasions will disappear even-
tually, if not sooner.”
“ A nice mate you are ! ” Murty went on, in an
injured tone. “ T’run away an’leave me alone
with a darned velocipede like that. Dunno how
I escaped alive.”
“ You didn’t mobilise with sufficient celerity in
the first place,” said Jim. “ And, as you were so
dilatory in despatching yourself in pursuit of the
horses, it was absolutely necessary for me to leave
you in sole charge of the attacking force. Had
you kept the gentleman’s head in the bag”
“Kept the devil in a bag!” Murty sneered.
“Ho you think I wanted it out to see what color
its hair was ? If he ken recognise us when he sees
us agin, ’fill be your fault. But I s’pose I’ll ’ave
to suffer, as usual.”
“Don’t alarm yourself, Murty,” said Jim. “ We
can prove an alibi. Just keep your mental
pabulum, and remember we are playing cards at
Gater’s.”
After breakfast on Sunday morning Jim and
Tarkalson, carrying a gun each, went down the
river looking for ducks. Murty wasn’t feeling
very well, so kept to his bed. Scully remained at
the hotel to keep Gater company. The shooters
had no eye for game until they came near the hut.
At a small waterhole close by they shot three
ducks, and the reports of their guns were immedi-
ately answered by faint coo-ees from the hut.
Tarkalson coo-eed back, and continued to call at
intervals as they approached, as though the voice
was hard to locate. When they pushed the door
open, and saw the big man lashed to a canvas
chair, their astonishment was a masterpiece in
facial expression.
“ Good Lor’! it’s Mr. Brody,” Tarkalson
exclaimed.
“A contortionist, I presume?” said Jim, sur-
veying him from the doorway.
JBrody heaved at the chair, and shuffled his feet.
“ Undo these straps, Tarkalson, for God’ssake !”
“ How did you get like that ? ” Tarkalson asked,
interestedly.
“ A couple of d —d brigands waylaid me and
brought me here. I was a bit fuddled, to tell you
the truth, and have only a faint recollection of
what really happened. ... I know I had a fight
at the gate.”
“ An’ have you been here all night ?”
“I have.”
“Must feel purty uncomfortable by this time,”
Tarkalson remarked, sitting down on the door-
step. Jim sat down beside him, and commenced
to fan himself leisurely with his hat. Anger, fear
and suspicion were blended in Brody’s eyes.
“Are you going to release me, Tarkalson?” he
asked, sharply.
“By th’ way, Mr. Brody,” said Tarkalson, “I
hear you’ve sold Crowlong, an’ that you’re leavin’
these parts in a week or two.”
“What the Ts that to do with it —or with
you ? ” Brody demanded.
“Why,” said Tarkalson, “there’s a little matter
of fifty quid owin’ to me an’ Scully, an’ it just
struck me that you mightn’t get another chance
like this to square up with us.”
“If you have any claim on me, Tarkalson, we
can discuss that at the station.”
“We discussed it there before,” said Tarkalson.
“ It was your innings then ; it’s mine now.”
“Look here, my man,” said Brody, angrily,
“let me warn you that you are making things
very ugly for yourself. It’s extortion ; and though
you may be innocent of any complicity in this
outrage on me, you render yourself liable as an
accessory after the fact by leaving me like this.”
“ But we don’t know you’re here!” said Tarkal-
son, quietly.
Brody, who had been straining forward, dropped
back limply in his bonds.
“ What’s more,” Tarkalson continued, “ you’re
likely to be purty stiff afore anybody else knows
yer here, seem’ as you’ve got into the habit o’
sometimes stoppin’ away a week without notice.
It’s a bad habit, Mr. Brody.”
Brody remained silent, staring at the ground.
“I suggest, Mr. Tarkalson,” said Jim, getting
up, “ that we leave our mutual friend to his re-
flections till the day after to-morrow, by which
time, I predict, he will be more amenable to
reason.”
“I think so,” Tarkalson agreed, following him
out. Brody woke up from his reverie as the door
closed, and called him back.
‘ * Come here, damn you ! ”
Tarkalson thrust his head in.
“ There’s a cheque book and a fountain pen in
the inside pocket of my coat. Get them out.
Then free my right hand.”
“Now, you’re cornin’ to your senses,” said
Tarkalson, complying with the requests. “Date
it for yesterday, please, Mr. Brody. This is
Sunday.”
When he had thus purchased his release, they
harnessed up the horses for him, helped him in
with much courtesy, and he drove away without
a word. Before leaving themselves they carefully
swept out all tracks inside and outside the hut,
even to the marks of the chair-legs.
Brody drove straight to Dulla, the nearest
station, and returned after dinner with Toby
Carson, the manager, and two blackfellows. They
spent several hours about the gate and the hut,
and along the road ; and when they could find no
tracks in support of Brody’s sensational story,
Carson began to question him jocularly as to the
number of glasses and the sort of grog he had had
at Gater’s on Saturday night. >
Brody came back to Gater’s in a sullen mood.
Tarkalson and Co. were lolling on the verandah—
except Murty Brown, whose eye was filling a hole
in the window curtain.
“Tarkalson,” he said, “ I want you to describe
to Mr. Carson how you found me this morning.”
“ How / found you?” Tarkalson repeated, sur-
prised.
“Yes.”
“ This mornivU ! ”
“Yes, yes ! You know—in the hut.”
“What hut?”
“ Why, the Three-mile hut ! ” Brody was
getting- exasperated.
“You must be makin’ some mistake, Mr.
Brody,” said Tarkalson. “1 liaven’t been nea(
the Three-mile hut.”
“Damn it all !” Brody cried, “didn’t you and
that man beside you find me bound to a chair ? ”
“ Me !” said Jim, elevating his brows.
“You, yes!” Brody answered, nodding em-
phatically, and getting red in the face. “You
had three ducks with you. Do you deny that ? ”
“Are you sure they had three ?” asked Gatei*,
“lam.”
“ Well, they only brought one home.”

Dear Sirs,—l had suffered for eighteen months with
bleeding of the lungs, and was given up by my

tirely cured. My lungs are as strong as anyone’s, and
I have never had any bleeding since; in fact, I feel
like a new person.

my children various times, and I have never had
anything frci>> either doctors or chemists which has
done me and mine the same good. I can recommend
Dr. Sheldcn’s New Discovery to all those suffering
from colds or consumption, as in my case.
Very gratefully yours,

Letters about
Liver Complaint
x
From Mr. J. Edwards, Davey-street, East Geelong, Vic., 31st August 1905.
“ For about twelve months I had been ailing from aggravated liver complaint, producing indi-
gestion, biliousness, a heavy feeling in the chest and frequent pains in the shoulder blades. I tried
the usual purgative remedies, which had the effect of only temporarily improving my condition. I
could get no permanent relief until I took Warner’s Safe Cure. lam pleased to say that the good
effect of that medicine became apparent almost immediately I commenced to take it, and in a short
time I was thoroughly cured. I have recommended Warner’s Safe Cure to many of my friends, who
all speak well of it.”
From Mrs. K. Chapman, 150 Paddington-street, Sydney, N.S.W., Bth February, 1906.
“ For a considerable time I was a sufferer from liver complaint accompanied by severe pains in the
back, depression of spirits and loss of appetite. I tried anything I thought would do me good, but
obtained no relief whatever. I happened to read one of your books giving accounts of wonderful
cures Warner’s Safe Cure has effected, and therefore decided to try its effect on myself. The result
was marvellous, as in a short space of time I was completely restored to good health, and, I am glad
to say, I have not been troubled with pains of any description since.”
From Mr. Gladstone Mayne, 22 Parade, Norwood, S.A., 14tli December, 1905.
“For several years past I suffered much pain from symptoms of liver complaint, such as bilious-
ness, indications denoting congestion, heavy pain in the right side, and a dull persistent pain under
the right shoulder blade. I was also affected with dizziness, headaches and loss of sleep. I resorted
for relief to a number of medicines, but did not obtain any good result until I began to take Warner’s
Safe Cure. I took only a few bottles of that medicine when all painful symptoms subsided. During
the last twelve months I have not felt anything of the old complaint. Being fully convinced that I
am permanently cured, I am truly grateful.”
From Miss Annie Leleman, Zabina-street, off Thomas-street, North Broken Hill, N.S.W., 28th
November, 1905.
“ I have much pleasure in testifying as to the efficacy of Warner’s Safe Cure, having taken that
medicine when suffering from functional derangement of the liver. I was troubled with severe pains
in the back, sides and head, with constant dizziness. Indigestion troubled me a good deal and caused
me many sleepless nights, whilst exercise of any kind brought on fatigue. Warner’s Safe Cure was
brought under my notice. I procured two bottles of the medicine, and after taking the second bottle
I found a great improvement had taken place in my health. All aches and pains had gradually
ceased to trouble me. T could eat without distress, and get refreshing sleep.”
From Mr. A. McEwan, 6 Princes Place, Darlinghurst, N.S.W., 15'th September, 1905.
“ I suffered for months from liver complaint, which caused dizziness in my head and a languid
tired feeling. I also had severe pains in iny side and back. I tried many medicines to obtain relief,
but without effect. I was advised to try Warner’s Safe Cure by a friend of mine, and it is a good
thing that I took his advice, as, after taking about four bottles of Warner’s Safe Cure, I was
thoroughly cured.”
From Mr. William Tanner, Hawks’ Lane, West Geelong, Vie., 31st August, 1905.
“ It affords me great pleasure to write to you as to the efficacy of Warner’s Safe Cure in my case.
For years I had been suffering from loss of appetite and indigestion, accompanied by violent pains in
my stomach and disagreeable symptoms after every meal. I also noticed a loss of nervous power.
When in this condition I began to take Warner’s Safe Cure. The relief I obtained was speedy, and
after I had taken a few bottles the symptoms I have described ceased to exist, and now I feel like a
3 ew man.”

That staggered Brody. Tarkalson, in fact, had
planted the other two birds to take to Dulla.
“He’s got ’em badly this time,” remarked
Carson in an undertone to Scully.
“Did I not give you a cheque this morning?”
Brody demanded.
“ You gave me a cheque,” said Tarkalson, “but
not this morning.”
“When?”
“Last night in the bar. Don’t you remember
when Gater went out to see what was disturbin’
his fowls? ”
“ I don’t! ” snapped Brody. “ I gave you that
cheque this morning.”
“You couldn’t ’ave done that,” Gater inter-
posed. “ It’s dated yesterday.”
“He asked me to ante-date it because to-day
was Sunday. ”
“And I cashed it for him last night!” con-
cluded Gater, who was taking no chances of
having a bad document left on his hands.
The roar of laughter that followed drowned
Brody’s remarks, and it rang in accompaniment
to the furious rattle of his wheels as he drove
away.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
Maggie’s Husband.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT soon got about that a woman in the
steerage had a Kanaka husband. ...at she
had married him in Queensland, and that he
was up in the galley helping the cook.
She seemed a bit ashamed of it. She never
spoke to her Kanaka mate, or of him, and she was
pretty lonely. None of the other women would
touch her with a pitchfork, and down below at
night-time, in the stuffy berths, when they had
talked every other subject to death, they would
settle down to the topic of the little woman and
her black husband, and make remarks across each
other’s bunks for her benefit, such as :
“If I marry a man, Liz, I’ll take care he’s not
a cook ! ”
“Why?”
“’Cos, if I run away, he’ll get a billet on the
ship, and come after me.”
And then they would laugh.
Tanna himself seemed happy enough. He
never interfered with his wife, but he looked after
her at times with a large, amused smile.
Up on deck the little woman spent her time by
herself dolefully gazing over the sea, and wonder-
ing what her people in Melbourne, such as they
were, would say to it. Although she had once
written home saying she was going to be married,
she had not had the courage to tell them the
bridegroom was a Kanaka. She had only called
him Charley.
And (as the cats guessed down below) she really
had made a dash for freedom. She had scraped
together a pound or two, and taken passage for
Melbourne ; but the little devil had been too
smart for her.
She wasn’t a bad-looking little thing either, and
some of the women crowd would, no doubt, soon
have made friends with her, out of pity, and
chummed-up if only to spite the rest. But an-
other development forestalled them. A big,
lumpy, quiet fellow, who had never said a word
to anybody, suddenly took to talking to her, and
was always seen about the decks with her, and
the cats below waved their tails and discussed the
matter at great length.
Something was said about Tanna having kicked
up a fuss, and it was also said he had been
browbeaten by the new Lothario. There was
something in the look of the quiet man to suggest
that this was very probable, but no disturbance
came to the surface.
Tanna certainly Qid not seem to take the matter
to heart. He went about grinning, and plunged
into his dish-scouring and all that more absorb-
ingly than ever.
Of course the converse across the bunks at night
became hotter now, but the little woman didn’t
seem to care a straw. She picked up wonderfully,
lost her doleful look, stood qp straight again, and
seemed to fill her things out better. She put on
all sorts of little airs, did her hair up nicely, and
gave quite a natty cock to her hat. One or two
of the steerage cats were getting so wild over her
improved appearance that murder might have
been committed down below some night if the
voyage had lasted much longer.
The last evening of the trip there were voices
on deck. *
“ What are you going to do ?
“ What am I going to do-?”
The vessel was going up the bay. It was after
10 o’clock. The two men spoke in the middle of
a narrow passage that ran across the ship between
the galley and the engine-room. Th,e big-shoul-
dered man had picked the spot, arid ' waylaid
Tanna as he went to the galley. - ' .
“What are you going to do ?” . It was Tanna’s
voice. The tone implied a business of
a’sort. Tanna talked apologetiS^iy—“sorry-to-
bother-a-gent,” so to speak—but with a distinct
suggestion of a grievance and a desire for some
satisfaction, if he could get it.
“Well! I’ll tell you what I’m going to do.
See ! I’m going to give you five pounds.”
“Five pounds !”
“Yes. Don’t talk—hold out your l’ll
give ’em you one by one, and then strike a match
and you’ll see they’re right.”
He never asked the other’s consent to the
bargain. Tanna didn’t seem to expect it —just
took the sovereigns. “Now,” went on the other,
“I’ll tell you what you do.”
“ I go on to Perth.”
“Oh, you meant to all along, did you?” He
could hear the Kanaka chuckling in the dark.
“Oh, don’t think you’ve done me; I’m glad of
it. Here’s another five pounds to stop there.”
They didn’t trouble to count the money this
time. He clapped the coins into Tanna’s palm
in the lump.
“Now gimme that ring. It’s her grandmother’s
ring, and I’m her husband after this. I’m Charley
—see! ”
Tanna screwed the ring off his finger, and handed
it to the big-shouldered man, and the interview
was over. Without another word one went out
at one end of the passage and one the other.
* * * *
“It’s number thirty-one!” she said as the cab
slackened to a walking pace past a row of one-
eyed wooden cottages in one of the lanes of
Carlton. They soon came to it, and “Charley”
lifted out the box and things and paid cabby,
while she knocked at the door. It was one of
those doors that do not open into a passage, but
straight off the street into the “front room.” It
swung back, and, without going inside, she could
see sitting round the table her old dad, her
brother, a younger sister, and —Tanna. _
G. BRON.
The Poet's Triumph.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was on the stroke of midnight, as I sat in
darkness musing
On the years that I had wasted and the money
I had lent,
When I heard the shrill landlady most un-
pleasantly refusing
To give candles to a poet who had never paid his
rent.
Then it was that I entreated her to tarry for a
t-ifie.
While I hunted for a shilling I had hidden in a
drawer.
And I heard her say “Disgraceful !” at the words
I could not stifle
When I suddenly remembered I had spent it long
before.
Then she straight away proceeded to remind me
that I owed her
More than five-and-forty shillings—and I knew it
was the truth.
But to change the painful subject I invited her,
and showed her
Sundry verses I had written in my very early
youth.
But they did not interest her, and she showed an
inclination
To indulge in some hysterics—which would not
have done at all,
As the lady was a widow and I wasn’t a relation,
And I heard degraded boarders laughing gaily in
the hall.
In that moment of confusion, from my dark and
dreary attic
’T would have been almost inhuman to request the
fair to fly—
She was something over forty, and inclined to be
rheumatic —
So I said I’d get some money—never told her how
or why ;
Simply said I'd go and get it, or I’d perish nobly
trying.
(I’d a notion I could borrow from an actor that I
knew.)
But the lady begged me not to—then she started
gently crying,
And her weight upon my palpitating bosom
wildly threw.
“I am yours i” she sniffled damply, “Yours for
ever and for ever !
And I always knew you’d pay me (tho’ you haven’t
done it yet !)
I’m ashamed I ever doubted, and I’ll never leave
you— never ! ”
And I knew she was in earnest, for her life had
been “ To Let ”
In a floating mist of lodgers that obscured the
mental vision
As the fog that comes in winter and envelops all
the earth.
But I heard the raging boarders howling at us in
derision,
And I panted curses at them as I listened to their
mirth.
“ Oh, how beautiful! ” she murmured in the midst
of her convulsions.
“This is what I’ve always dreamed of when I’ve
thought of married life ;
A fiercehusband and some infants—soothingsyrups
and emulsions,
And a strong right arm to shield me from the
never-ending strife.
Twenty years of keeping boarders ! Twenty years
and never mated !
(And I used to think of marriage when I started
boarders first!) ”
And quite careless of my shirt-front —limp and
blue and saturated
From the tears she’d shed upon it —into sobs again
she burst !
Then I muttered hoarsely : “ Woman, you are
woefully mistaken !
I will pay you in the morning ! ” Tho’ my hopes
were sinking fast —
After which I told her softly she was ill and
badly shaken ;
But she only clung the tighter, and related all
her past
Which I’d often heard recited—’twas a narrative
appalling,
Told in fragments, hissed in corners, and I knew
it ev’ry word,
From the time the late—extremely late—lamented
started calling
Until he untimely perished, and his end was long
deferred.
But while she unwound the legend, I was thinking,
thinking, thinking;
I was balancing the ledger ; I was totting up the
score.
And I gazed about me blindly like a man who has
been drinking,
When I told her my decision : “I will leave you
nevermore !
We will cultivate the boarder with an appetite
for sorrow,
We will catch and feed and tame him in our little
snug abode;
But I beg that you’ll postpone this little matter
till to-morrow,
As the night is almost finished and I want to
write an ode ! ”
Now, behold I am the master of the gaudy situa-
tion,
For the boarders work like demons just to keep
me in cigars,
And the slightest thing I scribble doth excite
their admiration,
So I write of fauns and satyrs, pagan goddesses
and stars,
And respectfully they gather when their daily
toil is finished,
Just to hear me read a canto or a passage from a
play.
For I keep on writing, writing with a fury un-
diminished,
And they've got to listen to it when their bills they
fail to pay l

CONSTIPATION.
WORK IMPOSSIBLE.
A GREAT SUFFERER
TELLS of RECO VERED
HEALTH.
Indigestion is one of the most prevalent,
as well as one of the most painful and disease-
producing complaints which afflict mankind
to-day. The symptoms are very numerous,
the most noticeable being a feeling of heaviness in the
chest, disagreeable taste in the mouth, dull pain in the head,
loss of appetite, and a pale and sallow complexion. No medicine
that acts upon the stomach only, never has, and never will, cure
R Indigestion. Stomach medicines may relieve it for a time, to return later
with increased vigor ; but to effect a permanent cure of Indigestion, the
root of the evil—the Liver —must be reached and regulated. For this
purpose Bile Beans are the only rational remedy. They stimulate the
glands which secrete the gastric juice to healthy effort; regulate the flow of
bile; purify the blood; promote the liver to healthy working order, and
incidentally tone up the stomach.
Mr. J. A. Marsden, a dentist, of High-street, West Maitland, N.S.W., writes “About
two and a half years ago I first felt the symptoms of Indigestion. I also suffered with head-
aches, constipation, and wind on the stomach. My ill-health interfered with my business to
no small extent, and it was not an unusual thing for me to stay away from the office for two
or three days together. Many were the reputed cures recommended by different friends,
which I tried, but without any benefit. Some three months ago Bile Beans were recommended
and tried. The first few doses proved to my satisfaction that I had at last secured the. remedy,
and, continuing with them for a month, I noticed a marvellous change in my condition. My
appetite was improved, my rest undisturbed, and in every way I felt a new man.”
Safeguard your health this winter by keeping a box of Bile Beans in the house, and
using them. Remember prevention is better than cure, and a Bile Bean, taken every other
night on retiring, will keep your system in a healthy condition. Bile Beans positively cure
Constipation, Piles, Biliousness, Indigestion, Headache, Liver Troubles, Stomach Disorders

Boils, Pimples, Rashes—ail eruptions of the

“I suffered for years from indigestion,
and a sort of teat lumps over my body.
The medicines recommended to me did no
good and I only wasted my money on them.
Being strongly advised to try
AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
I did so, and was agreeably surprised, as it
did for me all that is claimed for it. After
taking several bottles I was cured entirely
of my complaints. This is some years ago,
but I Bave continued to take two or three bottles every year, as Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla builds me up and enables me to. carry on my duties.”
J. Sinkiktson, Unley, S. A,
Keep your blood in good condition, keep your digestion
strong, and keep your nervous system vigorous. Then
you will not suffer from the weakening effects of hot
weather. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla was made for just these
purposes. It cools the blood, tones up the digestive appa-
ratus, puts force into the nervous system. And it fortifies
against hot weather, cold weather, or changeable weather.
It gives strength to ward off disease.
Don’t be deceived by trying some other Sarsapa-
rilla. Don’t experiment with imitations. Hold fast
to the tried and tested Sarsaparilla AYER’S. A
tonic for ail seasons of the year.
Prepared by DU. J. C. AVER & CO., Lowell, Mass., TJ. S. A.
Ayer’s Fills are a purely vegetable laxative for the whole family.
