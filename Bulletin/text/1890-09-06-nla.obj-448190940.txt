EVERY HOUSEHOLD— especially where
there are young cnildren— should be provided
with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use of
which has saved innumerable lives. Its effect
Is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the Irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough-Cure
in the world, ,it has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup , and the sudden
pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable.. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
in the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an un%
foreseen and sudden emergency.

ANY
WHO IS
WEAK
Nervous k Debilitated
VYho in his youth has trifled away his vigour of bod)-,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINE WAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who' is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.,
Professor STINEWAY’S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts rst. That every case.tfeated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used arc
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded .
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEWAY, who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION :-Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent -
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting ; fullness of blood in the head ; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains ? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
andrenergy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion,
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour?
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £\, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or write—I will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay I My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of Australasia.

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.— Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils, lie thinks
i he important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

(REGISTERED BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF NEW SOUTH WALES),
Late House Surgeon to the Great Northern Hospital, Caledonian Road, London,
SPECIALIST in the Treatment of Diseases of the
Reproductive Organs and Nervous .
Dr. PERRY was induced to publicly advertise himself as a
Specialist in this branch of the profession in consequence of the number
of persons suffering’ from diseases of this nature remaining uncured ; and
this is not surprising, when it is remembered, in consequence of the
general dislike of the profession to undertake these cases, the public
health has suffered, because .the majority of persons advertising to treat
these diseases, and calling themselves Doctors, Professors, etc.,
Are Neither the One nor the Other,
and exist chiefly because DULY QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRAC-
TITIONERS have not occupied the field.
Patients can, therefore, readily see the advantage of being treated
by a practitioner who has gone through a thorough Medical, Surgical and
Anatomical Training in the best hospitals ; and the Doctor argues that,
although it may be considered contrary to antiquated medical etiquette
to so advertise, yet he is promoting the usefulness and thk dignity of
the profession more by searching out and relieving this class of disease,
than by leaving them severely alone to the care of men who, however good
their intentions, have neither the opportunities or advantages of a regular
gedical training to become acquainted with the best methods of treating
these complex forms of disease.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER G, 1890.
Strikes.
The very prevalence of strikes during the
century—which has seen their inauguration
as a recourse of discontented Labour—indi-
cates the existence of a peculiar condition,
politically and socially. Labour on strike is
Labour in the sulks. The notable fact is that
Labour dares to sulk, and is permitted to
sulk with impunity—so far as governmental
interference is concerned. 11 is little more
than half a century since Labour was per-
mitted to show temper. Prior to 1825, any
tantrum of this kind ivas visited with per-
emptory and severe punishment. If a single
workman refused his services, nobody cared.
The man simply hurt no one but himself ;
and, as to himself, ho perished. But com-
binations of workmen, by refusing to sell
their services at the rate the capitalist found
it convenient to dole out to them, hurt the
capitalist as well as the labourer. The
earlier ruling authorities of England, being
either feudal lords, priests, or landlords,
looked down with supercilious contempt on
;dl industrials, distinguishing little, in the
hugeness of their arrogance, between master
mid man —base, mechanical persons all. But
/the masters w'ere nearest, the lords and the
I squires and the lords spiritual, and had a
trifle better access to their ear. Hence,
from the very inception of legislation
dealing with employment, its whole trend
and force has been in favour of master
against man. The Statute-book has been
burdened with a load of enactments
strengthening the hands of the former and
hearing down the resistance of the latter.
Combination in especial was assailed by a
series of cruel and drastic law's. In the
reign of Edward YI. a repeated, breach of
Acts aimed against combinations of workmen
involved the offender in a crushing fine,
with the alternative of the loss of an ear and
practical outlawry. Elizabeth repealed this
particular law, but the drift of legislation
continued in the same direction. During
the evil days of the Georges, trade after
trade w 7 as brought under the lash of laws
raised against combinations, and when the
third, and stupidest, George was on the
throne the hands of masters were braced
more strongly than ever by a hypocritical
law which ostensibly held an even balance
iby prohibiting Combinations aihong masters
as well as among workers, and making pro-
vision for arbitration in cases of dispute.
The former provision was, of course,
nugatory. As Adam Smith, wdio wrote his
great work a quarter of a century earlier,
therein remarks : —-“Masters are always and
everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant
»nd uniform, combination not to raise the
wages of labour above their actual rate . .
Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular
combinations to sink the wages of labour
even below this rate. These are always
conducted with the utmost silence and
secrecy. ... We seldom, indeed, hear
of this combination” (alluding to the former),
“because it is the usual and, as one may
say, the natural state of things which nobody
ever hears of.”
# * *
It must, therefore, have been evident to
the framers of the combination laws of
George 111. that, although ostensibly double-
edged, so as to cut combiners either among
capitalists or workmen, only one edge was
sharp. The entire system, however, broke
down. In 1824, a committee of the House
of Commons had to be appointed to review
the whole situation. This Committee re-
ported that these professedly equal laws
were “instruments of oppression in the
hands of employers, who had the means of
putting them in force against their men,
while no case pros known to the (Jiruim Ittce of
an employer belay punished water them , even
in the most flagrant cases of conspiracy
against the interests of artizans.” Our
quotation is from Harriet Martineau’s
“ History of The Peace. ” The consequence
was fresh legislation, which abolished the
anti-combination laws- between thirty or
forty having to be repealed. But in the
very next year that relieving law 7 was itself
repealed, and replaced by fresh legislation,
which rendered penal, “combinations for con-
trolling employers by moral violence”—what-
ever that may mean. Such associations are
now subject to common law —a convenient
way of placing Labour under the lash of the
courts, without defining the line which
separates their liberty of resistance from
criminal interference with the “ Rights of
Property.”
* 1 * *
Hence the situation of workmen in relation
to combined efforts to improve their condi-
tion remains tq-day very insecure. The
repeal of 80 or 40 penal enactments has by
no means exhausted the resources of the
capitalist class, so long as the common law is
at its disposal, and the Bench is recruited
from its ranks and sympathises with its senti-
ments. But, apart from those advantages,
laws remaining in the Statute-book and not
designed to bear upon strikers or unionists
can he made to serve. After the second
attempt at legislation just referred to,
Capital was desperately scared and rendered
furious by the first attempt ever made by
the mere clodhoppers—the agricultural
labourers—to follow 7 the example of the
artizan class and form unions. This was
about 1834. Sharp lawyers were set to work
to root among decayed and obsolete statutes,
and, in fact, to scrutinise the whole code in
order to discover whether there might not
exist some shred of unrepealed tyranny re-
lating to labour, or some scrap of law 7 bear-
ing on other matters which could be twisted
into a whip for the audacious Hodge. Such
a scrap was found, and complaisant judges
being, of course, on hand for the dirty job,
six agricultural unionists w 7 ere duly indicted
under an obsolete statute, really framed to
deal with cases of mutiny in the navy, and
were sentenced to seven years’ transpor-
tation.
* * ■*'
There is reason to believe that a somew hat
similar process is being resorted to at the
present moment by the Government of New 7
South Wales with reference to the existing
strike. It lias been stated in an evidently
official paragraph in the daily papers, that
the Crown law 7 officers are engaged in in-
vestigating .whether the leaders of the pre-
sent strike cannot be reached by the law.
This has much the air of a groping amidst
the back-alloys of the law's in search.of some
obscene crick by which the known enact-
ments and generally understood common
law may be supplemented by s me worm-
eaten statute or obsolete precedent. The
mere text of the codes is really of less conse-
quence than the spirit of their administra-
tors. If a Government and a bench of
judges write sympathising with one class of
disputants and denouncing the other class,
there will usually he discovered a method of
giving penal effect to their joint inclinations.
But Ministerial and judicial Partingtons
are equally impotent to stem a tide in the
world’s progress. Especially is this true of
the Ministers and judges of a petty province.
The conflict between Capital and Labour will
not be decided by events in New' South
Wales. This is a truth just as significant for
one sideas for the other. 1 f Labour becrushed
and conquered in Great Britain, the greatest
success which could conceivably be accom-
plished by an effort of Union Labour in New 7
South Wales—nay, by federated labour in
Australia —could not avert eventual defeat.
The fugitives from the field of battle in
Great Britain would break in upon the vic-
torious Australian labour and throw them
into miserable disorder. Immigration would
attain such proportions as would overcrow'd
the labour-market and render the employer
master of the situation. Similarly Capital
in New South Wales will have achieved but
a barren triumph should it successfully
emerge from the present crisis, if the masses
get the upper hand in Great Britain.
* # *
There are numerous indications that the
masses will, before long, get the upper hand
there. The present juncture and the social
history of the century point to a peculiar
condition. The continual occurrence of
strikes indicates a period of balance. Labour
is stronger than it was, and is bold enough
and pow erful enough to take up and main-
tain an attitude of nearly passive—although
menacing—resistance. Capital is yet strong
enough to sustain itself, but has almost lost
the supremacy which, till the present half-
century, enabled it to bring the whole force
of the State to bear against its antagonist.
For years the opposing classes have thus
confronted one another, neither being
weighty enough to turn the beam against its
antagonist. Even that attitude marked a
previous gain achieved by Labour. And an
equipoise of this character is never in-
definitely prolonged. One side or other
acquires weight. Now, every recent event
seems to indicate that the masses are about
to gain the advantage. If so, their attitude
of mere resistance will, in the very nature of
things, be changed for one of aggression.
As yet the worker can do no more than refuse
to work, while thereby forfeiting his means
of livelihood. Presently lie may find himself
in a position not only-to refuse to work for a
master, but able to resort to the alternative
most advantageous to himself and most
destructive to his antagonist—of working,
in combination, and with the countenance
and active assistance of the State, for his own
benefit and in direct competition with the
employer class.
# # #
To effect this momentous alteration of con-
ditions, no very extraordinary acceleration
of the present rate of democratic progress
will be required. The first essential is that
a larger proportion of the wage-earning class
shall recognise what their true interest is.
Every disturbance which arrests and con-
centrates attention such as a strike
operates in this direction. It sets men think-
ing who have not before troubled to think.
It sets in agitation a flood of discussion on
the very topics and principles which the
intelligent workmen desire to see debated.
And in reality this is about all that strikes
as at present conducted do achieve for the
worker. They are costly and painful methods,
but in this regard they are effectual ones.
Once a sufficient majority of the working
class is thus educated to the pitch of com-
prehending the essentials of the social pro-
blem, the rest must follow by an easy pro-
gression. The multitude will storm the
legislature, unless it be in a position to take
possession of it by quiet exertion of existing
rights, not previously properly understood
and turned to account. Once in possession
of the Legislature, there is nothing to stop a
complete organisation on co-operative prin-
ciples. The whole machinery and power of
Government will he the servant of Labour,
instead of its master and oppressor. Legis-
lative authority resembles the lamp of
Aladdin. Whoever possesses it is master of
a mighty genius, able and willing to perform
the must difficult undertakings, and prompt
to quell resistance from whatever quarter it
may proceed. Capital at this moment is the
African wizard who has obtained, by fraud,
possession of the lamp. If the Labor-
Aladdin but once regain the lamp, the
wizard’s day of power is ended.

Every day, indications that the period of
balance and suspense is nearly over, accumu-
late. Strikes multiply, and occur among
bodies of people who hitherto have been the
blind tools used by the classes for suppressing
the masses, whenever the latter thought too
much, and appeared likely to make an effort
to throw off their servitude. In Great
Britain, postmen strike, policemen strike,
and- -most significant of all —soldiers strike !
There is something of almost grotesque
significance in the names of the bodies of
soldiery who have recently “gone out on
strike.” The first to strike were the English
Guards. These have been followed by the
“Queen’s Own ” Hussars, after an interlude
filled by the “Royal” Inniskillens and the
“ Royal ” Artillery. It is worthy of remark
that the earliest phase of the first French
revolution was the defection of the monarch’s
“French Guards.” That the inferences
deducible from these conditions are not mere
vain imaginings of our own, may be learned
by reference to the folio wing bit of moralising
by the London correspondent of the S.M.
Herald in his latest letter ;
The men have been influenced by the general levelling
agitation that is going on throughout the land among
artisans, postmen, and police ; and the fact of this agita-
tion has to be looked in the eye and met. The lowering
of the constitutional fences, the extension of the fran-
chise, and the general “democratising” of our institu-
tions are now bearing fruit. Those who live longest will
see the most; but it looks as if the men of broadcloth are
going to have a rough time of it in England. Mr. Burns,
and such like persevering men, unchecked by law or
order, are sowing dissatisfaction right and left. There is
no knowing how broadcloth may not have to stand up for
its rights.

Property and Privilege are staggering and
floundering under the series of blows they
are subjected to. They have hitherto
counted on the military and police to crush
the people when desired. But now they
have to grapple with the problem how to
quell the police and the military. A most
inconvenient amount of sympathetic unison
has been exhibited between the people and
the offending soldiery. Attend again to the
correspondent of the S.M. Herald :
The departure of the Guards for Bermuda was a touch-
ing sight. They looked healthy and capable. They
marched as no troops in the world march—firm of foot,
with a superb carriage.
This last bit is, of course, bunkum. The
correspondent has not been able to shake
off his habit of writing Rule-Britannia
blather. It is part of his nature to froth
at the mouth enthusiastic twaddle about
Her Majesty’s Guards, and to lead fools to
fancy that the German Guard regiments, and
the French Guards, and the Russian Guards
are mere goose-step recruits compared with
“our splendid household troops.” He had
forgotten for the moment that these were
mutineers sentenced to transportation, and
that his cue should have been
like this : “ Showing in their shame-faced
aspect and slovenly bearing the evil
effects of resistance to lawful discipline.”
However, let him continue in his own way
Here are some more unconsidered testimonies
from his pen I* ‘ There was a tremendous
crowd to cheer them on their way.” Next
another slice of forgetful slobber: —“ They all
went forth as if inspired by a most perfect
sense of duty !” And listen to another naive
confession : —“Not since the same regiment
marched to sail for the Soudan has so much
sympathetic enthusiasm been evoked.” “The
Coldstream guardsmen turned out in force
to do honour to their comrades”—their com-
rades, the banished mutineers, who had just
previously been told by the Duke of Cam-
bridge, Commander-m-Chief, and'Uncle to
the Queen, that they had disgraced the name
of soldier !
“The “Local Producer.”
In the course of a sorrowful lament upon the
present industrial crisis Sydney Daily Tele,
graph strikes a new and brilliant argument in
favour of foreign-trade. The policy of the
importers who live by the destruction of local
industry is fast wiping-out the resources of
New South Wales, and leaving the country
more and more dependent on foreign supplies •
and consequently prices rise to famine rates
whenever a partial stoppage of communication
leaves the community to rely in a great measure
on its own unaided efforts. The daily bread of
New South Wales is supplied by the protected
colonies which languish in the darkness of
political error, and when these morally and
mentally degraded races are no longer able to
come to her relief serious results immediately
ensue. Like England, but in a less degree, New
South Wales can be pretty well reduced to
starvation and submission by any enemy who
can cut-off her communications with the outer
world; but the Telegraph, in a moment of
frenzied inspiration, propounds the theory that
her difficulties arise, not because her industries
have been squashed, but because they haven’t
been squashed enough ; and now that a limited
measure of Freetrade has left her helplessly
dependent on her protectionist neighbours, it
urges that more Freetrade is the thing that is
wanted to raise her to her proper position.
And not content with putting the cart before
the horse in the customary manner of Free-
trade logicians, it proceeds to pile that vehicle
on top of the unhappy animal in the-following
manner:—
So much for the present aspect of this lamentable crisis.
The effects of it are already becoming manifest, and, as
usual, the heaviest weight of the consequences fall not
upon the particular capitalists whom the unions are fight-
ing, but upon the masses out of whom trades-unionism
draws its membership, and upon the community generally.
The first of its results has been to upset the equilibrium
of the produce and breadstuff market in a manner which
will enrich a few persons while inevitably bringing hard-
ship and hunger to thousands. All the results of a highly
protective tariff can now he temporarily seen in fairly'
good working order in our midst. Outside supplies have
been almost entirely cut off in several lines, and the local
producers are thus enabled to levy high charges upon
consumers for certain of the ordinary necessaries of life.
This is bad enough, hut it is not the worst. At the very
inception of the strike keen-sighted speculators bought up
practically the whole supply of some of the articles and
are still holding for the higher prices which must ulti
mately prevail. It is quite within the scope of probability
that some of the shipowners have “hedged” in this
manner, and that whatever they might lose through the
laying up of their vessels will be recouped in part or ia
full from the consumer’ pockets.
* * *
In the first place, it will be noted that-
according to the Telegraph —it is only the
fiendish “local producer” who has raised the
prices of the necessaries of life, and the Free-
trade party having neglected to hang or other-
wise utterly abolish that degraded individual in
the days of plenty and prosperity, he is now
rising to affluence at the nation’s expense. From
this it may be gathered that the importer who
deals in foreign grain and vegetables has not
raised his prices at all, or otherwise taken a
mean advantage of the country’s extremity. It is
one of the striking characteristics of the Foreign-
trade party that it always curses the local pro-
ducer, and pines for his obliteration. It hates
the manufacturer because he interferes, no
matter in how small a degree, with the sale of
foreign shoddy, and it loathes the farmer
because, even in his decayed and ruined state,
he is still an obstruction to the trade in produce
imported from America, Victoria, South Aus-
tralia, and other countries which, under a
Protectionist regime, are able not only to fill
their own requirements, but to sell their sur-
plus food supply to the unhappy Freetrade
community in Eastern Australia. The dream
of the Freetrade monopolist is to abolish all
this internal rivalry, and leave one-half the
population to live on the production of sheep
and wool in the grassy plains of the interior,
while the other half unloads foreign produce
from nigger-manned ships at Circular Quay.
But so far this golden vision has been only par-
tially realised, and consequently the last rem-
nant of the local producer has raised the price
of the food supply of Sydney. If Freetrade
had been carried to its logical conclusion ten
years ago this catastrophe would have been
averted, for there would have been no local food
supply to raise, and the local producer couldn’t
raise it, because he would have gone to join the
dead C.ksars and other equally extinct public
institutions.
* # #
Still, if the much-cursed local producer were
allowed to raise sufficient to supply the require-
ments of the nation, it is obvious that the
present difficulty would have been avoided. It
is only because N. S. Wales is forced by the
Freetrade system to buy what she would other-
wise produce for herself, that the stoppage of
outside assistance becomes a matter of any im-
portance. The ports of America, of New Zea-
land, or of Victoria might be blockaded till the
day of resurrection, and the only result would
be to cheapen the principal necessaries of life
by forcibly retaining the surplus in the country.
In a low, mean, underhand, protectionist manner
these countries manage to grow their own food-
supply, despite the fact that none of them has
anything like the agricultural resources in pro-
portion to population which are possessed by


New South Wales, and wasted in supporting
fj tr p je of M‘Millan and the other descen-
Unts of the importing horse-leech. The insane
I o wl that Protection is synonymous with scar-
■itv i s merely the repetition of the old cry of
private Murphy that all the rest of the regi-
icnt is out of step. If Protection meant scar-
H, tv and Freetrade were another name for abun-
dance, then Britain and New South Wales
would not be reduced by a Freetrade system to
depend on their Protectionist neighbours for
their daily bread and cabbage. It is entirely
oW i n g to the enlightened policy of the adjacent
provinces that the shortness of supplies now
Prevailing in the markets of Sydney has not
already given place to hunger and absolute
famine. If all Australia were run on the politi-
cal doctrine of Parkks and Gobden and Sydney
Gaily Telegraph, then all Australia would be
equally dependent on imported produce, and
already the worn-out cab-horse would be com-
'pounded into pies, and the cat in the back-yard
would develope into soup, and the old family
do" would be roasted for dinner and served up
j 1 and those citizens who were unable to
afford such luxuries would lie flying from their
homes to lead a precarious existence on rabbit
in the far interior.
# * #
It is the favourite contention of that brand of
imported dry-goods politician, who is the stand-
ing curse of New South Wales, that Freetrade
carries with it the inestimable blessing of a
cheap loaf, and though there is a painful lack
of coherence about this statement, in view of
the conditions now prevailing, and considering
the fact that the cheap loaf, when it is to be
had, comes from a protected country, the point
is of comparatively little importance. Britain,
the shining example and illustration which is
dished up with weary iteration by every
Freetrade orator, has at least obtained a
loaf of some kind despite her suicidal policy,
and she eats it sitting on the verge of a
volcano. So long as Britain commands
the sea her existence as a nation is secure,
hut should the long run of good fortune
which has attended her for centuries at last
<dve out, as such good fortune will and must do,
sooner or later, the full significance of Cobden’s
"real scheme will begin to be appreciated. For
by the logical operation of that same scheme
Britain is the only nation in existence to which
a three-months’ blockade means irredeemable
ruin. Even Mexico or Belgium would not be
half so helpless as the mother country if another
De Ruyter or De Witt should succeed in
closing her seaports for a few short weeks, and
her fleet once destroyed any fifth-rate maritime
Power on earth could starve her into the sur-
render of half her empire, and could reduce
Britain to the meanest rank among European
nations. Freetrade has successfully placed a
nation of 37,000,000 souls in such a situation
that one great disaster may wipe out eight cen-
turies of progress and leave a fallen people to
die like a rat in a hole, or else surrender at
discretion. No doubt such a danger seems
almost incalculably remote, yet the reality may
come at any moment, and the fact that Britain
has held the seas for two long centuries since
the day when the victorious Dutchman block-
aded London and dictated peace in the Thames,
is merely a proof that the catastrophe is two
centuries nearer. New South Wales, by her
servile imitation of Britain’s policy, has suc-
cessfully placed herself, so far as her geographi-
cal position will allow, in the same precarious
situation, and the howl of the Telegraph
against the “local producer” eloquently ex-
presses the indignation of the dominant party
at those circumstances which have left the great
experiment incomplete.
*. # *
The average Australian Freetrader is merely
the pawnbroker and the bill-discounter in dis-
guise. The shoddy has eaten into his soul, and
lie is prepared to sell his country in order that
imported pants may go up, and candles of
foreign manufacture realise an extra halfpenny
per pound. To him the nation is merely a
mouldy trader in a dingy office, and national
progress means an extra 23,- per cent., and
ambition is only another name for a hungry
desire to trade off a crate of German merchan-
dise at a high figure, and collect the proceeds
promptly subject to the usual discount. The
hopes and brains and intelligence of the nation
may demand some surer material resources than
a precarious trade in foreign calico, but then
Providence built the nation that it might buy
foreign calico, and a nation which doesn’t buy
calico isn’t worth possessing. Even the Creator
himself, according to the Freetrade apostle, is
down on protective tariffs, and His mission is
to be a mysterious Power shoving the import
business along with an unseen yet omnipotent
hand. And yet even under this beneficent dis-
pensation there has arisen here and there a
malevolent spectre known as the “ local pro-
ducer,” who has attempted to grow corn and
potatoes contrary to the dictates of the Gospel,
and has opposed himself to that great moral
axiom which says that M‘Millan and his tribe
shall import all that the country requires, and
sell it at a large profit. And the sorrow of the
Freetrade newspaper is that this sinful indi-
vidual has taken advantage of his enemy’s diffi-
culties and raised his prices. It is consoling to
reflect that if the present fiscal policy lasts out
another decade in New South Wales, he will
not be alive to repeat the experiment.
The Reward of Labour.
Under the competitive method of production
the value of all products, according to Karl
Marx, is diverted into three channels. The
first receives the quantity necessary for the
sustenance of the producer, the second the sum
necessary for the replacement of the capital ex-
hausted in reproductive effort, and the third the
surplus value—which may again be subdivided
into rent, interest and profits. Labour is the
first necessity of production, and labour-power
cannot exist without sustenance; therefore,
Labour’s claims must be fully satisfied ere
further apportionment takes place. If Capital,
as exemplified in the instruments of toil, be not
continually replaced, then industry must cease
to be fully remunerative ; therefore, the second
share is fitly devoted to working expenses, while
the balance, if any, is apportioned as has been
already shown. The failure of any industrial
enterprise, as a rule, may be put down either to
bad management or to the fact that the profits
withdrawn by monopoly have been so great as
to encroach on the amount necessary for the re-
placement of used-up capital. The amount of
use-values absolutely necessary for the susten-
ance of the worker must, whether industries be
profitable or not, be equally sustained, and any
attempt to reduce the amount withdrawn for
that purpose must prove disastrous to produc-
tion, by reducing the force and intensity,
physical and intellectual, of labour-power.
* # *
Viewed from a national standpoint, all exer-
tions of labour-power which result in a return
of products sufficient for the support of the
producer and the replacement of capital, are
profitable. Viewed from the capitalistic stand-
point, only those exertions which, in addition,
provide surplus value, can be thus classified.
Now, surplus value can only be realised when
labour produces more than is required for its
support; this it does only when the articles
produced bear a use-value for a lengthier time
than that expended in their production. There-
fore, the average exchange-value of any article,
perishable or imperishable, is mainly determined
by the amount of labour-power expended on its
production. The value of that labour-power is
chiefly determined, not, as is commonly sup-
posed, by supply or demand, but by the quan-
tity and quality of the necessaries of life used
by the average producer. Here it is that we
discover the source of strikes in the difference
of opinion existing between employer and em-
ploye as to the amount of value created by the
latter which he may retain for the mainten-
ance of his comfort and his physical, mental,
and moral well-being.
# # *
What sum is sufficient to support the
“manual-labourer”—the wharf-labourer, for
instance, in comfort ? At present he is paid
Is. per hour during a day of eight hours, and
at a slightly higher rate for overtime. It
must not, however, be imagined that his
average weekly earnings are therefore £2 Bs. or
over, for during the year his periods of en-
forced idleness are many, and it is calculated
by those who ought to know that in every
year the wharf-worker is only employed, on
an average, during nine months. Requiring to
be continually awaiting at the receipt of custom
opportunities of labour, he is thus precluded
from filling up these idle intervals by wage-
earning in other industrial avenues, and, there-
fore, it may be unhesitatingly asserted that—
even if by unremitting toil he is enabled to earn
£5 or £6 in some weeks—his total earnings for
the year do not exceed, even if they always attain
to, a sum of £2 ss. weekly. This sum, according to
the S.M. Herald’s hydrocephalous bantling,
the Echo, is amply sufficient for the mainten-
ance of “ those who have not and will not learn
of the better things of life,” though the writer
might be pleased to consider that if we all
“ had ” and “ learned of these better things ”
among which, we suppose, the writing of the
Echo’s leaderettes is numbered—that there
would be no one left to provide the necessaries
of life. No doubt the capitalist also looks at
the matter through similarly distorting green
goggles ; but as neither former nor latter con-
sider the matter logically and unbiasedly, we
prefer to examine it more closely before accept-
ing their dicta.
# # #
What is the cost of the articles abso-
lutely indispensable to the existence of
the ordinary wharf-worker and his family?
Doubtless even the Echo will admit that a
wharf-labourer is justified in entering into the
married state, if only for the purpose of raising
up aspirants for the vacancy on the wharves
that will eventually be created by his decease.
House-rent is, of course, the most important
item; now cottages, such as they are, may be
rented in the suburbs at Bs. or 10s. weekly, but
it is essential that the wharf-worker shall dwell
near the wharves, and there houses are not to
be obtained except at a higher rental. Even
setting down rent at 10s., this large deduction
from 40s. leaves in hand, say, 355., more or less, to
provide bread, meat, vegetables, milk, groceries,
firing and light, for, perhaps, several growing
and grown persons, to say nothing of clothing
for several backs. Presuming that it is
found equal to these demands, how much may he
expected to remain for schooling, the purchase
of literature (presumably the Echo’s guide to
“better things”), for the medical attendance
sometimes necessary, for rational amusement,
for the replacement of worn-out ‘ ‘ household
gods,” aye, and for the purchase of little odds
and ends of womanly finery, or grog and tobacco
for the wage-earner ? How much ? Well, not
much. But, presuming for the sake of further
enquiry that this miserable sum is equal to all
these demands, with such an income and so
many outlets of expenditure, can it be possible
to lay by anything for the inevitable rainy day,
the hour of sickness, casualty, or calamity, or
to make provision for the time that comes to
every man, who lives long enough, when he no
longer can work ? No, no, a thousand times no.
Would it were possible to condemn for a time
those who prate about the prosperity of the
worker to be ground through the mill of hard
work and home hardships that he is doomed to
endure while life lasts. The survivors of this
ordeal would have found good reason to alter
their opinions.
* * *
It has long been the aim of the employer in
the older countries to reduce tire earnings of
the legitimate bread-winner, and thus depre-
ciate the proletarian standard of living, by the
employment of women and children —in many
cases mere infants—during long hours at starva-
tion wages. This traffic in flesh and blood
having been largely curbed by the passing of the
Factory Acts, it is now his habit to play off the
large masses of the literally-starving, the
uttcrly-helpless and hopeless unemployed
against those whom monopoly is grinding out of
existence more gradually. In new countries
where the man, unjustly treated by an
employer, has some measure of access to
natural opportunities, these methods are to
some extent inapplicable, and monopoly is
forced to have recourse to the utilisation
as labour-forces of the native races, or
the importation of black and yellow skins,
whose notions of comfort are limited, and who
are content to occupy a much lower grade than
that demanded by men of his own colour.
Warned by experience, and the example of
America, where such importations have caused
grave social difficulties, Australian public
opinion has demanded that further introduction
of low-living peoples shall cease, and employers
are now driven to attempt to starve the discon-
tented strikers into submission by employing,
temporarily, inefficient labour (driven into the
cities by the locking-up and misuse of land) at
higher rates than those prevailing prior to the
strike. On the present occasion they may be
successful, nevertheless, at some subsequent
period they will be compelled to accede to the
demands of a labour-union whose ramifications
know ho boundaries.
* * *
The utilisation of any fresh mechanical inven-
tion, no matter how largely it increases produc-
tion, only temporarily, and then in individual
cases, increases surplus values ; for when such
a machine enters into general use—exchange-
value being determined by the amount of labour-
power embodied in an article—a given value is
simply spread over a greater number of products,
and the exchange-value of each article that is
or might be thus produced is greatly reduced.
Monopoly, then, failing to combat an improve-
ment in the workers’ standard of living, which
keeps pace with that increase in productiveness
caused by improvement of appliances, will year
by year be more closely hemmed in between
consumer and producer, until at length
they meet on a plane where the consumer
of one use-value must have already been the
producer of some other use-value ere its acquire-
ment became possible. The entire social economy
of the busy working hive will then contain no
standing-room for drones, and they will be com-
pelled to enlist in the great industrial army
either as producers, administrators, instructors,
or distributors. To-day, the capitalistic method
of production and accumulation almost anni-
hilates all self-earned private property. Then,
the industrial method of production and utilisa-
tion will annihilate that expropriation of use-
values which has given birth to poverty and all
the crimes and miseries that follow in its track,
and has filled earth’s highways with those who
fain would, and those who need not, work. The
onward inarch of mankind towards the Co-
operative Commonwealth which is to be is slow,
but undeniably sure.

A Parson on the Fence.
The “ strike” address delivered at Sydney on
the strike by Rev. Dr. Sevan, of Melbourne,
who preaches the gospel for £30 a week, may
be simply and contemptuously described as a
Jefferisian utterance. In the first place, the
lecturer’s assumption that “the public” form a
third party to the conflict, is an utter fallacy,
for no matter how ignorant or indifferent to the
true interests of their own class a large number of
people may be, the fact remains that every man
in the community is either a capitalist or a
wage-earner. Some people, including a large
percentage of the clergy, are both, and their
leanings are almost universally towards capital.
As to Dr. Sevan’s cheerful story that the masses
“ have all the power in their hands, every man
having a vote,” we need but inform him that,
there being in New South Wales no system of
vote-registration, thousands of men are totally
deprived of the franchise, inasmuch as necessity
forces them to be absent at election-time fi om
the district to which they electorally belong.
Further, even if every man has in theory one
vote, there are hundreds and hundreds of capi-
talists who have, by reason of their landed
property, three or four, or ten votes each, and
regularly poll them, thus effectually antagonising
the votes of as many franchised workmen. Thus,
for instance, Mayor Burdekin has a vote in every
Sydney constituency, and we know that Mr.
George Thornton, of the City Bank, has at
least twelve parliamentary votes in and around
Sydney; also that Mr. F. A. Wright, M.P.,
has 25 votes in New South Wales. Every dude
whose name is on the roll as a member of a club
which owns its own premises, has a vote, in
addition to the one he polls for the district in
which he lives, and to those he enjoys by
virtue of his property ; but where is the
manual - labour elector who possesses more
than one vote? Why should clergymen
travel 600 miles to sit on a fence and talk
slobber? As to Dr. Sevan’s text, “ Take heed
and beware of covetousness, for a man’s life
consisteth not in the abundance of the things
that he possesseth,” it is all nonsense. A man’s
life does consist in abundance, as the personal
appearance of the clergy in general elocpiently
testifies ; also, this extract from Scripture is a
sentence which, as the masses are beginning to
understand, has been used for a thousand years
to establish the privileged classes in secure
possession of the result of generation after
generation of shameless robbery, and to make
the poor “content with the lot to which,” so it
is blasphemously asserted, “ it has pleased God
to call them.”
A Cheeky Minority,
The Sabbatarian party in Victoria lias resolved
to demand a plebiscite to decide whether public
libraries and art galleries are to lie accessible on
the Day of Rest. This is an ingenious device
and worthy of the guileless Children of Light
who invented it. At the polls the Sabbatarians
would have all the advantage. Their opponents
have no organisation to work with, while every
parson and Sunday-school teacher would go out
to bang the gong of war, and the Y.M.C.A.
would rise in all its might and dignity, and the
teetotal fanatic, and the Social Purity howler,
and the fellow who screeches discordant hymns
on the wharves, and the offensive bigot who
sends tracts full of blazing hell to the patients
in the hospital, and the Salvation Army choir,
would all go on the warpath together, and even
the Chinaman would be routed out of the House
of Joss and the stray Mahommedan would be
wakened and shaken up, and if by all these
devices a majority of only one was obtained the
question would be announced as set at rest for
ever. The Sabbatarian party has for years de-
nounced the idea of taking a vote on such a
subject as a vile pandering to Baal and other
unclean gods, but now that a popular vote
seems to be their only hope this old objection
lias been sunk out of sight. Apparently, how-
ever, they forget that the question is
not one to be settled in such a fashion.
A mere majority has no more right to
close a public institution on Sunday than
it has to close a church on the same day.
If a library is to be shut because a trifle more
than half the population has no use for it, then
every religious denomination in Australia should
be closed up at once, because they are all
minorities —every one. And even if the atten-
dants at all the churches are counted in as
belonging to one creed, still they represent less
than a quarter of the population, and, conse-
quently, on the doctrine of majorities, they
want to be wiped out bodily and for ever.
Moreover, the theory of the plebiscite is defec-
tive on another point. If the Sabbatarians win
—no matter how or by what devices —they will
denounce all further agitation on the subject as
infamous treachery; if they lose, they will go
right on and fight the battle to the last gasp
just the same. They always do. The Sunday
bigot with numbers at his back is offensive and
insufferable ; the same bigot when deserted and
alone compares himself to the one righteous
man who was found in Sodom, or to the solitary
prophet who went forth and whooped in Nine-
veh, The habit is fixed and incurable. It is
no earthly use to toss up with a Church that
speculates with a double-headed coin, and is
ready to prove that it has won whichever side
comes uppermost.
“ For Myself and a Woman, for Ever and
Ever, Amen.”
William Ellery, the Sydney letteivsorter,
sentenced last week to 18 months’ hard labour
for having stolen letters containing cheques ami
postage-stamps, represented in extenuation of
his crime that his wife had been long sick and
that as his poor salary had been drawn on in
advance and he could raise no more money, he
turned thief to get funds to send her for change
of air—the only expedient which promised to
keep' her alive. The Law did not admit that
Ellery’s plea extenuated his offence in any
way, and herein the Law was more right
than it generally is. If Ellery had reasoned
he might have realised that letters are of all
forms of property the most sacred. He who
cribs a letter from a mail-bag runs the risk of
stealing, in addition to postage-stamps, tin-
peace and hope not alone of a life, but of lives.
Under the caption of “ Letters that never
Came ” histories of tears might be written and
tales of death be told; and the man who,
while gold chains emblazon the white
waistcoats of usurers and other vampires
steals a letter entrusted to him, is ignorant
of the first principles of morality. But now
comes another aspect of the question. What
Ellery did, ignorantly or otherwise, he did to
keep his wife alive. It was a case of Ellery
and his wdfe against the world, against the
universe. For the sake of Society, for sake ol
Society’s opinions and its laws, should a man
see his wife die ? Assume that the case comes
to this—that on one side a man sees social order
maintained and his wife dying by its mainten-
ance, and, on the other, social order disrupted
and his wife restored to health, what is the
healthy, the brave man’s first impulse ? Does
he not act, if forced into a crime, even as Nora
Helmer acted to save her husband’s life ?Is
it not that he and his wife will fight the world
together, will fight the universe together, and
that law, neither human nor alleged to be
divine, shall be allowed to break the bond?
The lion fights for the lioness, the tiger
for the tigress ; even the sparrow fights for his
wife and her little nest, not against one or two
or a dozen, but against everything and every-
body whose influence tends to disruption. The
man who is not prepared to do that—even
against Society—is only worthy of a society
woman. Rudyard Kipling, the possessor of a
very fresh and clear mind, in a set of verses
recently published, puts it: —■
But till we are built like angels, with hammer and chisel
and pen
We will work for ourself and a woman, forever and ever,
amen.
That idea is the first one of a true social system.
The farther Society departs from it, the less
Society merits regard, the less the laws are res-
pected. Society should not be accepted as any
man’s tyrant. Kipling ’s notion was to show that
the individual man should, or would, break away
from compacts with his brother men for the sake
of his wife, but, as he treated the subject, be
ignored the difference between compacts better
able to help a mail to keep his wife than
existing ones. Marry a woman, keep a woman,
die for a woman—that is Humanity’s shibbo-
leth ; and whatever Law says, whatever Society
says, whatever Religion says, all these are
secondary, if they allow the man and the woman
to choose between death and social dishonour.
The Age of Flabbiness.
Vanity Fair looks with a dark and bilious
eye on the weakness of the Tory Government
in England, inasmuch as that broken-backed
aggregation has neglected to ‘ ‘ put a head ” on
everybody who doesn’t seem quite contented :
The prevailing weakness of the present age is flabbiness.
Flabbiness of thought. Flabbiness of policy. Flabbiness
of action. It is a bad quality and encourages mischief.
Wo said much the same thing when the dockers’ strike
was in the air last year. We say it again now when the
country’s servants are affecting to strike. And if any
honest man who cares for the honour and well-being of
his country will compare in their results all
of any considerable proportions, he will what
we say is right.
We rise to second these observations. *No
Roman centurion ever attempted to go on
strike, so far as history relates, so long as the
empire could raise nails enough to crucify him
with. Neither did the primitive Christian ever
demand higher wages while the tiger iu the
Coliseum was kept fresh and in good working-
order. There was no fooling after an eight-
hours’ movement among the Protestants in the
cells of the Inquisition, cither—at least, if there
was, we never heard of it, and they didn’t form


a Trades Union, and demand that they shouldn’t
be burnt after two o’clock on Saturday, or object
to put in overtime at the stake. But, then,
there was no flabbiness about Governments in
these days. They had a certain unobtrusive
vigour about them instead, which has since died
out, and when a man wasn’t satisfied with his
pay they concluded that he was trying to under-
mine the Throne, and they hung him up by the
oar till he felt that his income was really larger
than he wanted. It is rough on the Tory editor
when lie looks back on these good old days, and
then thinks sadly about the flabbiness of the
present age, and the way people rise up, con-
trary to the dictates of Providence, and object
to live all their lives on dry bread, and then die
at last in the workhouse.
All Toy.
Ah Toy, the common heathen from the Hoang-
ho, who has successfully demonstrated in all
the Victorian courts that no Chinaman who is
a British subject can be .poll-taxed under
British law, is about to demonstrate the same
fact over again before the Privy Council in
November next; and considering all the proba-
bilities in his favour it is time for Australia to
consider what is to be done after that. What
Ah Toy has proved so far is that, owing to the
patched and murky imbecility of the Constitu-
tion of these “ colonies,” no law to exclude the
yellow leper will ever hold water, and until
the Constitution is mended the heathen may
come in thousands and millions at his pleasure.
Also the Constitution can’t be mended until the
British Government lends a hand, and the
British Government can’t lend a hand until the
British Constitution is altered and re-fixed to
meet the case, and how to re-fix it no one
exactly knows. Therefore, if Ah Toy comes out
uppermost, every Chinaman who ever paid a
poll-tax in this country will have an action for
damages, and among them they hold out a fair
prospect of national insolvency; and every
Chinaman in the Flowery Land may come in
without any tax or other obstruction. Or else
the British Constitution must go, on the ground
that it is too slow and unwieldy to be of any
use at such a crisis, and Australia must inti-
mate that even though tbp Privy Council should
break into eternal smash and the silken ‘ ‘ bonds ”
should be consigned to the dust-heap, the
Mongol has got to stay out. If the British legal
system has tied itself up into such a hard knot
that it can find no adequate remedy for the
difficulty—and it is one of the peculiarities of
the British code that it seldom can find a
remedy except after a hundred years of hard
consideration—then it is too old and exhausted
and rheumatic to be of any use in Australia.
When Ah Toy’s case is settled, the probabilities
are that some legal remedy for the Chinese
agony will be wanted in a great hurry, and
there will be no time to wait while the Imperial
Government sits down to contemplate the situa-
tion. It would be an ignominious fate for the
Empire to be wrecked on one common one-horse
pagan from Asia, but should that saffron-hued
alien win his case it will be necessary to put
some unexpected velocity into practice, or else a
political breakage may be looked for at an early
day. The British Constitution has been bragged
about, and advertised, and wept over at
banquets and loyal gatherings, and sung and
gxoaned and snuffled about for ages, but if it
isn’t large enough to keep out one Chinaman then
all the poetry that has been spent upon it was
wasted energy which might have been better
employed in carrying bricks.
Sydney Daily Telegraph, the organ com-
mercially figure-headed by Mr. J. R. Carey
—also president of the syndicate which
lias organised the acquirement by a private
company of the public tramways of Syd-
ney—prints an eloquent apology for black-
legging, and plaintively speaks of the manual-
labour and other traitors to the workman’s
cause as “ Men who have done no wrong in the
eyes of the law.” True, O Carey & Cos. ! ad-
mirable are thy reservations. The present laws
of Australia, of the world, simply constitute
a gigantic conspiracy against Labour. Mr.
Carey aforesaid is a director of the Port
Jackson Steamship Company. The ordinary
deck-hands of that corporation’s passenger-
vessels, we are told, work all day on every day
of every week, and each man’s average week’s
work means—ye gods !— one hundred hours.
One hundred hours at 6d. per hour, the London
docker’s wage, would be 505., but the Port
Jackson Co.’s deck-hands (who, in addition to
their other duties, embark and discharge cargo)
don’t, so far as we can hear, get 50s. for
100 hours’ work. They only get £9 a month,
or say £2 Is. 6d. a week. They are allowed no
holidays—when a man takes a day off he has to
pay a substitute, which usually costs him 4s.
over his own pay, as no casually-employed sea-
man can be got to accept less than 10s. for, say,
14 hours’ work (some days’ work means 18
hours—from 6 a.m. to 12 p.m.) Now, the
question is this : Will Mr. Carey, when
the syndicate over which he presides gets
the control of the public trams, do his
best to arrange that they are not worked
on the £9-a-month-100-hour-a-week principle?
There can be little joy in the life of a steamboat-
hand who gets £2 Is. 6d. a week, has to snatch
his meals as best he can, and has to stay away
from his poor home two or three nights a week.
People were afraid the other day that the
steamboat-hands would strike. If these are
really the conditions under which they work —
and so far as we can ascertain the men’s case is
not overstated—who is there that would not
sympathise with them? The Bulletin looks
forward with pleasurable anticipation to an
announcement that Mr. Carey has, as the
initial step of a big reform, induced his fellow-
directors of the P.J.S.S. Cos. to grant the com-
pany's deck-hands one holiday out of every seven
days, thus letting their weekly “graft” stand
at the respectable total of 84 hours or there-
abouts, which will be the ordinary trades-
unionist’s weekly 48 hours upside-down.
It is interesting to learn, apropos of the “spon-
taneous ” offer made by seven or eight hundred
Sydney warehousemcn’s-clerks to work on the
wharves in order to defeat the union manual-
labour, that in one warehouse where a dork of
independent mind was asked to “spon-
taneously ” sign the paper, he declined ; where-
upon he was given to understand that he might
leave the office. Therefore, he ultimately said
“I have a wife and family, sol may as well
sign,” which he did. What is the value, as a
declaration of opinion, of a document signed by
miserables who figuratively live in a copying-
press while the fat boss stands by with both
hands on the screw ? Competition is Jo keen for
employment in soft-goods houses (many of the
biggest of which are run by a few men and four
times their number of small boys) that three-
fourths of the warehousemen’s assistants are
morally in the condition of Brough Smyth’s
now historical clerks, who, when their stern
taskmaster rang his bell, jumped from their
seats in terror and thought of God’s dread
summons on the Day of General Judgment.
*
A Sydney morning paper having in a leader
recommended the “upholding of the law at
all hazards,” that is, without consideration as
to whether it be just or unjust, the little organ
of the strikers thereupon remarked :
Bad laws were made to be broken, and the community
which respects unequal inequitable laws is not fit to
enjoy—never can enjoy—the privileges of free men.
Whereupon the organ of capitalism enquires
solemnly;—
VVhat is this but the wild insensate gibbering of anarchy,
which demands that every man shall be a law unto him-
self? Bad laws were not made to be broken by anyone
who chooses to consider them had, and a people At to
enjoy the privileges of free men will deal with them in an
altogether different fashion. Good or bad, the laws of
this country are the free expression of the will of a free
people, and as such they must be respected until the same
power which enacted them repeals them.
The labour sheet has since foolishly withdrawn
the word “ broken,” and asserted that it should
have said “'bad laws were made to be revoked.”
That is sheer balderdash. Bad laws, our bad
laws, are not ‘ ‘ the free expression of the will of
a free people ” by several billies-full; they are
in many cases but an expression of the tyranni-
cal will of certain long-decayed debauchees and
autocrats, whose names live now only as themes
for execration, or were made in the interest of
the enfranchised few for the oppression of the
many. Such laws will never be revoked until
they are first systematically broken and trampled
under foot. It is not enough that they he allowed
to lapse into desuetude, for so long as they remain
on the statute-book any fanatic may imperil the
liberty of any reformer for the purposes of sec-
tarian or class-oppression. For instance, what
has the “ free expression of the free will of the
free people” of this country got to do with its
present Sunday laws ? Would it be possible
nowadays to pass such repressive enactments
through any of our legislatures ? We repeat:
Bad laws were made to be broken in order that
they may be revoked.

Social economics are divisable under three
heads : —Wealth, Capital, and Labour. The
first represents the staples of life, such as wool,
grain, metals, timber, live-stock, land, &c. The
second comprises artificially-developed organisa-
tions of wealth which, scientifically used, in-
crease the wealth, comfort, or conveniences of
humanity at a saving of proportionately in-
creased labour, such as tools, plant, railways,
ships, or instruments. The third defines the
means by which all wealth or capital is made
valuable. To be possessed of capital without a
reserve of wealth or labour in the case of a
strike means ruin to the capitalist when all bis
operations are suspended. A wealthy man can
live on his reserves ; a labourer can produce for
himself; but the capitalist lies between the
Devil and the deep sea, as he has no assets
enabling him to maintain life, neither has he
the knowledge or power requisite to obtain
them himself. His wealth consists of capital
which ceases to be wealth the moment that its
productive properties are stopped. More and
more risky are becoming the chances of the
individual non-co-operative capitalist ventures,
and before long private investment and specu-
lation must come to a standstill. It will
then be time for the community to take
over the business of the capitalist and
work the same on collective principles. The
railways are already treated on this plan, and
the shipping and other transport agencies for
passenger and goods distribution must follow
suit. Then Wealth and Labour—the present
intermediary having been removed—will con-
front each other for the final struggle. It will
not take long in deciding, however. The
wealthy once left to live on their amassed means
will speedily consume them and find themselves
on the verge of positive starvation. The labour-
ing class in the meantime, having the control of
capital and an organised system of production,
will have earned more wealth than the wealthy
owned at the time of their entering upon the
contest for supremacy. The moral is obvious.
Somewhere or other among the laws of New
South Wales is, we believe, an enactment
against * ‘ truck, ” specially providing that no man
shall he paid any part of his wages in liquor or
in a public-house ; and yet, we are told that the
truck system has long been in force at a certain
Sydney hotel run in the interests of a large em-
ployer of labour, who, it is claimed, has paid
his hands with cheques which they found great
difficulty in changing, except at this special
public-house—the natural result being that the
workmen usually went home to their families
with more grog than money. In this alleged
fact may be found a key to the solution of “a
disgraceful episode ” which recently caused
much tribulation among the champions of the
divide et impera trick/
What is the matter with the Sydney daily
press that it practically failed to report the
proceedings of the meeting of provincial news-
paper proprietors the other day ? Can it be
that the Sydney newspapers have a special in-
terest in seeing the country press of the mother
colony continue in its present abject position ?
However that may be one thing is certain—that
unless the journals of the provinces form a
strong combination in defence of their own in-
terests, which are, in many cases, quite opposed
to those of the metropolitan newspapers, they
will continue to have advertisements offered
them at a halfpenny an inch, they will be de-
barred from a fairly - apportioned share of
Government advertisements, and will remain as
poor as church-mice. All country pressmen
should read the Inland Printer (Chicago),
which shows the position occupied by the
American provincial press as set fortli at its
periodical reunions, the solidity of its organisa-
tion, and the independence (resulting purely
from combination) of the men who run inland
American newspapers. The present isolated
position of the New South Wales country-
pressman too often means misery and drudgery
and hopeless dependence to the end of the
chapter.

A will-case with 12 barristers and 12 solicitors
all hard at work eating up the estate on behalf
of 34 defendants, is in progress in Victoria. In
any community which had brains enough to
know a horse from an egg it might have been
settled by sending the disputed document to the
judge in a large envelope, and asking him to
read it and state his opinion, but Australia is
not built that way. Yet if commerce and law
were run on the same plan it would be necessary
to send 12 men and a four-horse dray to carry
home a pound of meat, and every man would
have to receive his instructions in writing and
spend two days in reading up the case and con-
sidering the question of food in all its bearings
before he started, and then it would be neces-
sary to appeal to a judge to decide whether the
meat hadn’t got so bad in the interval as not to
be worth delivering.

It is cabled that the London Daily News, a
journal which, while professing to be “Liberal,”
is an organ of the fat bourgeoisie and the idle
official classes, and therefore a more formidable
and insidious foe to Labor than, the hopelessly
stupid Tory section of the British press, in
effect tells Australian workmen to be careful
lest their places be taken by imported coolies
and cheap white European labor. With the
latter we shall deal by adopting the United
States law against labour-agreements made
beyond the seas ; but were any serious attempt
made to import blacks wholesale, the manhood
of this country would, if necessary, take up
arms. But the contingency last mentioned is
too remote to be seriously discussed. The only
effect of such a cable message is to expose the
woeful ignorance of the British press concerning
the temper and power of the Australian worker.

Another long-felt want has been filled by the
publication of the Agricultural Gazette oe
New South Wales, the highly-advertised
organ of the new N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture. This work is a perfect treasure of
useless knowledge, and the plain, unvarnished
tales which it unfolds should secure for it what
John Haynes calls “a nick” in the “hood-
war ” of every cockatoo-farmer. Farmer
Chumpkins, for instance, will be delighted
with the chapters on “ Tylenchus Arenarins,”
while all doubts which have worried the
troubled brain of Farmer Gubbins will be set
at rest when he reads that the common, or
garden, variety of the potato-bug is readily
recognisable by the fact that these industrious
pests possess “ transverse strise, hardly hetero-
cephalus, head concave-truncate, ellipsoidal
median bulb or median sesophageal bulb ellip-
soidal ; cardiac column broad, porus excretorius,
bursa small, tail conoid, vulva prominent or
otherwise,” Portions of the articles on “ Mac-
rophallus ” and “ Askanasji ” will be regarded
as obscene language by the Unscientific selector.
Since 1870 New Zealand lias had no less than
30 millions in loans, which have been expended
on public works, many of them unproductive
and some useless. Wildcat railways were built,
harbours constructed which there was no ship-
ping to fill, “ boom ” towns laid out only that
people might gamble in corner lots. In 1874
the imports of the country amounted to
£8,373,111, against exports reaching only
£5,433,000. This condition of things has, how-
ever, been gradually changing for the better ;
for last year the imports did not exceed
£5,998,224, and for the present they will not
exceed £6,270,000. The change, further, is
still more striking when we remember that in
1873 the population of the islands did not ex-
ceed 295,966 inhabitants, while now it is more
than double that number. The exports, again,
of New Zealand are a still more significant
evidence of her growing prosperity. Last year
they were some three and a-half millions in
excess of her imports. Her last Budget shows
a surplus of £115,974, which ought to go a long
way in relieving taxation. A country which,
with a population of only 600,000, has exported,
as New Zealand has done, to the amount of
£10,000,000 in one year, may fairly he considered
as having sown her wild oats and started on the
high-road to prosperity.

Marian Burton played the name-part on the first
two nights, when her rendering was embued with
more dash than could have been expected from a
lady of her proportions and temperament
Though Von Suppe’s bright little trifle has been
produced on three or four prior occasions in
Sydney when Kate Chard, Emelie Melville, and
Annette Ivanova donned the garb of the giddy
Florentine student, this is the first time he has
walked the Royal’s boards. For the time the
company has been much strengthened by the en-
gagement of _ the Misses Ivanova, Royal and
Salinger, Knight Aston and Edward lire; yet
though Tilly’s “ Tis the Prince ” was, per-
haps, the vocal gem of the first night, on
the whole the performance does not compare
to advantage with that of the Dunning company.
On opening night, in two of the principal duets
the singers failed to chord throughout and seemed
to be carrying on a triangular duel, in which the
conductor represented the apex. The comedv
business of Johnny Gourlay’s Lotteringhi is excel-
but Signor Snazelle’s Lambertuccio is spas-
modic and blossoms chiefly in the moment of gag.
The opera is, of course, well staged, and Gordon’s
opening scene is very beautiful, the second is
merely passable, and the third —a night-scene in
the Palace gardens, over which the dailies have
gushed—is to us a weird and incomprehensible
mystery.

William Rignold received a magnificent
reception on his return to the Sydney stage in
“ Now-a-Days,” at Her Majesty’s. The play is
in the hands of the original cast, but scarcely
seems to go with the dash and completeness of
the first production. As previously intimated,
“ Macbeth ” will be produced on a scale of great
gorgeousness on Saturday evening at this house.

There is a slight decline in the attendance
at the School of Arts, but the change of billon

After a long delay, caused by the refusal
of the instrumentalists to accept from 10s. to 20s.
as remuneration for attendance at each concert
and the two rehearsals which necessarily precede
it, the first of a series of ten orchestral concerts,
under the leadership of Signor Hazon, took place
in Sydney Centennial Hall on Saturday last, in
presence of an audience that looked scant in
that big building. The first violinist’s seat,
vacated by Mr. Allpress, is now occupied by
George Hall, the conductor of the bright little
Criterion Orchestra. The acoustic properties
of the Centennial Hall are far from good,
for reverberations always mar any note that closely
follows another, nevertheless the concert was
highly successful. Wagner’s “ Entr’ Acte to
Lohengrin,” a shimmer of weird notes culminat-
ing in a magnificent crash of melody, was enthu-
siastically encored, and had to be repeated, and a
similar compliment was paid to Handel’s minuetto,
“Berenice,” a grave, yet sweetly tender melody
arranged for modern orchestration by Mr. W. T.
Best. Pass-out checks being unobtainable at half-
time, it was impossible for ushers to distinguish
re-entering auditors from those attempting to get
in “on the nod.”

On the last night of “Paul Jones.” at
Sydney Royal, towards the close of the second
act, just when the “mariners bold ” expected to
receive another gigantic wreath, they were hit
hard by a large consignment of greengrocery
directed to their care by the occupants of the
gallery. The late premier baritone of the Carl
Rosa Opera Company quickly fled the stage in a
great state of indignation, which has since been
mollified by the statement that in Australia the
heaving of carrots and cauliflower is deemed a
compliment. The Insect followed more slowly,
and, eyeing a very fine cabbage, was understood
to mutter that the strike had made vegetables
scarce at his boarding-house.

At Sydney Centennial Hall, on Monday
evening, 5000 people were dispersed, after waiting

The production _of “lolanthe,” at the
Adelaide Royal, by W. and G.’s Comic Opera
Company, was not generally regarded as an artistic
triumph. The new features of the entertainment
were the appearance of Elsa Sherwin as Queen of
the Fairies, Helen Kinnaird as lolanthe, and
Stannis Leslie as Private Willis. The two latter
acquitted themselves creditably. The dying effort
of the season was the trump-card, “ Mikado.” J
L. Toole opened in “Chawles” and “Ici on Parle
Francais,” and society folks turned up in great
force, because it was considered the proper thing,

It is said that “A Fool’s Paradise,” now

Wniou (Mrs. Brough). This companion is dis-
vered to be the half-sister of the arseniced

vfuses to dispossess him, however, and he pre-
rt res to erase the name of his wife from his will in
i’f'der to substitute her’s; though how he can
h;ci ueath what he never legally owned is a point
that wants clearing up. The Lucrezia Borgia, of
Ids bosom then determines to finish him off before
this alteration can be made, and therefore distills
double dose of arsenic ; but, detected in the act
t the family physician (Robert Brough), swal-
lows it herself, bids everyone “Good-night,”
d steps outside to die on the mat. This
f ea t she accomplishes inside five seconds,
toxologieal record, surely, and the curtain
falb/ after a little more gentle _ babble, on
u uninteresting scene and an apathetic audience.
The author has introduced two colomless young
idiots (Lilian Seccombe and Owen Harris) for
comedy purposes, and the whole play contains
only one real flesh-and-blood character, Sir Peter
Lund, well played by Robert Brough. Even the
part of the lady-poisoner is a mere shadow, and
the whole thing is as hollow as a drum. Spun out
by long intervals, it only plays two hours ; there-
fore after Wednesday night it will be preceded by
“Barbara,” a charming trifle by Jerome, produced
here some months ago. Should that not bolster it
up, it will be withdrawn, probably in favour of
“She Stoops to Conquer.”

The illness of Marian Burton, on the third
last night of “Paul Jones,” afforded her under-
study, Sydney Deane, an opportunity to make a big
hit. In fact he sang and acted so well that he was
calied before the curtainat the end of thesecoudact,
and his upholding of the part during the remaining
nights as a novelty would have pulled things
together, but the lady, hearing of his success, was
on hand promptly during the rest of the season.
The change confirmed us in our opinion that love-
making between two women is an unsatisfactory
business; Paul’s scenes with Yvonne went twice
as well with a man in the namepart.

George Darrell is still allowed to roam at
large round the stage of Melbourne Royal, and on
Saturday that unnatural phenomenon commenced
a second series of gyrations in his own dramatic
perversion of “Potter of Texas.” The ghastly
absurdity of George’s latest concoction beggars
description. There is, perhaps, no other man in
Australia who could dream such a drama, not if
he devoured a sack of cold potatoes with a
hundred-weight of underdone pork and then
dropped asleep on a tombstone. The authorities
will be wanting in a proper sense of duty unless
they order the Mounted Rifles to fire off their 40
rounds of ball-cartridge at one pop, and blow the
inane riot into everlasting space. The diphtheria
outbreak, and the typhoid epidemic at Toorak,
are blessings in disguise compared with “Potter
of Texas.” It is beyond a joke. The fact of live
men and women drawing salaries from such a
show when they might be stokers at another kind
of gasworks is the strangest feature of the present
struggle between labour and capital. At this
stage of the notice a burst of demoniacal
laughter conies in. “Potter of Texas,' like
that previous atrocity, “The Lucky Lot,”
consists almost entirely of George and Mrs.
Darrell, who absorb the limelight and large
capitals, and generally behave as though all sense
of the ridiculous was lost to the family. George
is an ever-present calamity under the name of
Charles Errol (the Australian), while Mrs. D. is
generally there in the capacity of Lady Annerley,
a tragic female possessed of an iron will and a
drivelling secret wrapped-up in a paper. In the
first act she gives George this miserable penny
surprise-packet and tells him to keep it in his
pocket until they are both buried or something, after
which he falls under the influence of an Alexandria
cigar, and the lady has to sit on his carcase and
thump him back to consciousness, whereupon he
kills 320 Arabs by shooting them in the big toe,
and the British troops roll-up just in time to bury
the heaps of slain. For hard shooting this act
takes the cake; and when—as happened on Satur-
day—George’s revolver occasionally gets tired
of the massacre and refuses to go off,
the Arabs fall down dead just the same.
Later on it transpires that George has
forgotten all about his heroism and the prize
packet, and the rest of the drama is devoted to a
paper chase of no interest whatever. At the finish
nothing appears to be settled for certain, not even
George’s marriage, and if anything were settled it
ought to be accomplished by the aid of a brick.
As an actor of heroes George grows more hopeless
every week. His calmness in the midst of perils
is irritating to the last degree, and his self-conscious
walk reminds one of the old gentleman who “wants
to sit down. ” His chief characteristics are a strange
ability to walk in a sitting posture, and an extra-
ordinary capacity for wearing top-bots and no
waistcoat. Mrs. Christine Darrell outrages possi-
bility with much force and some indications of
dramatic talent misapplied, and the rest make
minor objects of themselves, Edith Blande, in
the part of Ida Potter, being the best of an
afflicted gathering. The Trades Hall Council are
earnestly requested to call “Potter of Texas” out
on strike.

“ Alone in London,” which filled the
Alexandra on Saturday, is always certain of a
respectful hearing when its lucidly - constructed
story is well told. The Bland Holt company,
being rather stronger than usual this journey, .are
carrying matters through with impressive effect,
and the great scene in the old Sluice-House —one
of the most legitimate sensations ever created in
melodrama—grows in awesomeness. Mrs. Bland
Holt’s performance of Nan has acquired strength
these last two years, Maggie Knight is above the
average Gipsy Tom, and Bland Holt’s picture of
Jenkinson developes fresh bits of humour as time
goes on. The others seem to be first-class, or good
enough.

Although the first night’s promise of
crowded houses for “ Hero and Leander ” has not
been realised, yet business at Prin-
cess’s is sufficiently creditable to public intelli-
gence. A lack of length, rather than strength, is
the only drawback to the complete financial suc-
cess of as pretty a stage poem as ever exerted a
refining influence upon a degenerate age of stove-
pipe hats and dull respectability. Words are
wanted. The present meagre allowance of blank
verse improves on acquaintance, and the scenery
and situations would carry far more talk than the
nameless author had the temerity to write down.
He has neglected a splendid opportunity in not mak-
ing the virtuous High Priest come a-wooing Mrs.
Potter when Bellewis swimming, after the manner
of Brian do Bois-Gilbert with Rebecca. A stormy
scene between Mrs. P. and the inflamed ecclesi-
astic would add interest to the play, and fill in
that allowance of gas without which modern audi-
ences think they are being sent empty away. At
present, “Hero and Leander ” may be compared
to a graceful, slender form that appears weak to
people who judge female proportions by dress-
makers’ padding. In truth, it is a delightful pro-
duction, and, but for the now general disbelief in
Mrs. Potter, would have become the rage of Mel-
bourne.

There is a painful sameness about modern
melodrama, and the dire necessity of doing some-
thing to lighten-up the gloom and impart variety
to the proceedings leads us to offer Mr. Bland
Holt a friendly suggestion. We have no desire to
hinder the tragic end of the heavy villain, for vye
recognise the necessity of killing that person off in
the last act, somehow or other, and as he has
already died by every recognised means, except
spontaneous combustion and being eaten by wild
beasts, we don’t wish to interfere with the disease
that carries him off. But we have noticed that
during his career it has become a fixed habit of
that gentleman to embezzle • a gigantic sum
in gold, and hide it somewhere, and it is
also imperative that it should be missing
when he comes to dig it up again, and then
it, is required that he should tear his hair, and
go on in a dreadful manner. Also, now and then
there appears to be a difficulty in making the
plunder vanish in a feasible way. Therefore we
would suggest that a good effect might be arrived
at if the depraved monster could be induced to
bury the coin in a district that is subject to earth,
quakes, and then, just as heis coming to look fo r
it, a volcano might open on the spot and blow the
whole pile at the moon. After which the scene
might close with the prize ruffian groping round in
the dust, and finding only 3s. 6d. left as the re-
ward of a long life of crime and bloodshed, and he
might be heard asking himself if it was worth his
while to swim in gore during 45 years for a half-
crown and two sixpences, and a bushel of dirt and
grit and bricks.

The outbreak of lire about once a week,

At the Royal General Theatrical Fund

had the cool stupidity to say that he didn’t appeal

its wealthy hangers-on, who seem to insinuate
that a theatre should be run on the financial lines
of a church, where, after paying for your seat,
you are expected to give a trifle extra for the

On the first night of “ Hero and Leander, ”
at Melbourne Princess’, the disclosure of Heil-
nings’ gorgeous scenic temple of Aphrodite
evoked a loud and long-continued call for the
artist. That modest individual stood quietly in
the wings, however, and was easily -dissuaded
from facing the footlights by the lithe Leander
who whispered hurriedly: “My dear f’lah;
doncherkhow, present costume (looking at a well-
worn slightly-stained suit of dittoes) quite in-
congruous; in fact, anachronism would disturb
dramatic unities, s’xnother time,” and so forth.
John didn’t go on, but at the close of the
last act he saw something that made his
old eyes wink. Leander, drowned in swim-
ming the Hellespont, had been thrown up
by the cruel billows at Hero’s feet on the pebbly
beach of Sestos, attired apparently in naught but
a pocket-handkerchief or a lady’s veil. There were
loud calls for “ B’lew that worthy couldn’t very
well go on clothed only in a loin-cloth, so donning
a “ cold snap,” blue cloth, Inverness cape, ho took
the call. As he stood bowing before the curtain,
with his B.C. legs sticking-out beneath his
twentieth-century toga, he looked like a clown
on a cold day outside a booth at a fair. But, no
matter, the play was over and the unities were
past outrage. Hennings ought to be on hand
now every night during the rest of the run, attired
in mosquito-netting—in case he gets another big
call.

The Shipping Gazette, a London class

they do considerably less work.” That’s partly
what unionism sprang into existence to achieve.

The procession of strikers, bound for the
Exhibition Building, marching at the quick-step,
took nearly half-an-hour to pass this office last
Saturday, and it was estimated that at least
10,000 men thus showed the strength of combina-
tion. Headed by the stalwart Delegate Mooney,
of the Shearers’ Union, on horseback, they looked
an intelligent, well-nurtured, cleanly body of men,
and, watching them closely, we only saw one of
their number the worse for liquor. By the
way, that they look fairly well-fed and art;
decently clad, seems to convince the ordinary
hide-bound worshipper of Mammon that they
have no just cause of complaint. “ Look at ’em,
he says, triumphantly, “What have they got to
strike about?” But moleskins and a skin-full are
not the chief end, nor yet the sole object, of the
man who wants to get as much happiness here
below as other people will let him have.
Moreover, the unionist who waited till he had tc
hobble on crutches and hide his nakedness with
an evening newspaper, ere demanding alterations,
would then discover as little willingness on the
part of the dominant classes to concede them, as
now. The sight was a cheering and ennobling
one, a proof that community of interest can recon-
cile differences of opinion, and that after all the
proper study of mankind is man. A pathetic note
was touched by the disorderly marching of a
number of boys, led by a poor canvas banner-
unionists in embryo—at the tail of the pro-
cession. They were, we imagine, the lads
employed in tapping off the rust with little ham-
mers from the inside of boilers, and their presence
is a convincing proof, if further proof be necessary,
that the ramifications of unionism are wide-spread-
ing and that the Socialism which is feared by tin
uninstructed of this generation will be familiar as
household words in the_ mouths of the next. A
still larger procession will march next Saturday,
when the Domain will be the People’s Forum.
Rev. Andrew Gardiner, whose wife re-
cently got a rule nisi in divorce against him, has
returned to Sydney, and says he wishes the utmost
publicity given to the proceedings of the eccle-
siastical court about to try his case. From this it
may be inferred that Mr. Gardiner claims that,
though the decree nisi of the legal court has been
made against him, there are still two sides to his
case. Who knows? As an instance of how
innocence may co-exist with the most suspici-
ous appearances, we may point out that in the
witness-box the other day Lady Dunlo (who,
lung before her marriage to Lord Dunlo, had had
an illegitimate child to one Weston) deposed that
immediately after her marriage—Lord Dunlo
having decamped to Australia —one Wertheimer
(with whom she had previously travelled alone to
Paris platonically) came and rode out with her
He never visited her after the theatre, and they never
had supper together. She told him not to come to the
house, as she was being watched. She had never
kissed Wertheimer in the presence of any person.
Wertheimer kissed her once when he went to America,
saying that he might not return. He had never kissed
her since her marriage. It was not true that he ever pul
his arm round her waist. Since her marriage he had
always treated her with respect, and expressed strong
affection for her, which she never returned. There was
never any familiarity whatever between them. Being
cross-examined, she said that she had never kissed
Wertheimer at all He had often asked her for a kiss, but
had never kissed her except on the occasion mentioned.
He was very kind to her. She saw him every day and had
lunched, dined, and supped with him. He used to
buy everything she required. Her parents were
unaware that she was with him in Paris or Trouville.
Wertheimer took a house solely for her, and made her a
present of it. Housed to keep his evening dress there,
and slept there about twice a week. She had nothing to
do with him, and lived by herself. She had four horses,
a well-furnished house, and a private carriage, and ser-
vants to wait on her, all at Wertheimer’s cost. She re-
ceived cheques of considerable sums from him to support
the house. Lord Dunlo often called at the house, and
used to bring her home from the theatre and concert-
hall, and stav late. Wertheimer gave evidence denying
that Lady Dunlo had ever been his mistress. From the
first time he knew her he had a great admiration for her,
and on many occasions asked her to marry him. He
suggested that she should go to Avenue-road
because Weston forced an entrance to her rooms
and attacked her. He gave her the house before
her marriage, and had never given her money since mar-
riage. He never went to the house without a third person
was present. The statement that he had been in her bed-
room was absolutely false. At the hotels on the Con-
tinent he gave his name as Wertheimer, andhers as Miss
Bilton. The furniture for the house cost £500; He also
gave her horses. He had kissed her twice, and had put
his arm around her, much to her annoyance. He admitted
that his conduct was a mistake ; but he wanted to marry
her.
And yet, despite all this, the jury returned a ver-
dict in favour of Lady Dunlo, the case against
whom, as here stated, appears a thousand per cent,
more ugly than that made out in court against
Parson Gardiner—who, we are told, means to
appeal.

The Governor of Barataria.
AN HISTORICAL SKETCH.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Tt is not, I hope, necessary, in these
enlightened times when the book-canvasser is
abroad, to give a geographical account of the
great colony of Barataria. If, however, there
should be any person in ignorance of its where-
abouts I have much pleasure in referring them to
the standard work on the subject by the accom-
plished historian, Don Miguel Cervantes di
Saavedra.
# * *
Never, since the golden age of Barataria,
when it was ruled by the illustrious Sancho Panza,
did Governor ascend the vice-regal throne of that
famous dependency with better intentions than
Don Adriano de Speranza—as the rest of his titles
would take up too much valuable advertising-
space, I regretfully suppress them. He came of a
noble family famous for knightly deeds and de-
sperate razzias by the misty light of the moon, ere
cattle-branding became degraded to the level of
an exact science, and when every man was his own
policeman and Justice of the Peace. He was
allied by marriage to the haughty old Firbolg
house of De Muffins, whose chivalrous motto was
“Pride before Potatoes.” Was ever high career
started under happier auspices? Alas for earthly
vanity ! Alas for Hope ! The very intensity of
his well-meaning became the cause of Don Adri-
ano’s downfall, and the perfervidness of his devo-
tion to duty a fatal pit in his proconsular path to
Slory. # # #
The Baratarians were a generous people in
their relations with their Governor. They gave
him a princely income to live upon, and an exten-
sive though somewhat lugubrious palace to live in,
and asked little beyond affability and condescension
in return. But they were particular in insisting
that ho should be a grandee. No ordinary hidalgo
would satisfy them. The Baratarians were not
different from other democrats in this respect.
Don Adriano was a grandee of a very fine type—
too tine some people said who believed in nobility
of the l.arge barbaric sort, with huge thews and
sinews and a tremendous raptorial beak. Cer-
t duly Don Adriano was small—an aristocratic
epigram instead of an epic. But, though small, he
was good. The stowage space that in patricians,
built on a more prodigal scale, is chiefly occupied
by a varied assortment of hereditary vices, was in
Don Adriano crammed with conscientiousness.
He recognised the fact that in the utilitarian age
in which his lot was cast it was not sufficient to
have come of a family whose members have done
no work for centuries—not sufficient, that is, for
one who aspired to Fame and a high place among
those who are called Great by their contem-
poraries. Therefore he determined to do all that
was asked of him, and more, and do it with all his
might. He became affable and condescending to
an extent that sometimes seriously alarmed his
medical advisers-, but he still kept on smiling like
the Spartan boy, for he saw his reward in the dis-
tance. To smile, and smile, and smile, and be an
honest man is a hard task, but Don Adriano suc-
ceeded tolerably in it. If he had any natural in-
born contempt for the Baratarians as a semi
barbarous folk who hung by their eyebrows to the
Cimmerian Edge of the great Empire lie repre-
sented, he was painfully careful i n concealing the
fact.
# # =*
Not so his Lady, the Donna Pomposa de
Speranza. She exulted in showing her scorn for
the poor Baratarians, and never lost an oppor-
tunity of slighting their wives. This became such
a mania with her at last that she was avoided by
all the native nobility, and had none to pay her
court but a few fawners and grovellers upon whose
prostrate forms she wiped her feet in intervals of
yawning. It was poor sport, but she had been
accustomed to it, and could not do without it.
Many people endeavoured to discover a reason for
her supernatural hauteur, but were unsuccessful in
their search. The Donna Pomposa was neither a
great Beauty nor a Queen of Fashion, and her
ancestral House, old and proud, could never boast
of having had kings of its name, as was the case
with many fine old Firbolg families, whose
descendants are at present reigning over small
public-houses, or carrying bricks up the giddy
ladder. It is said that it was in reference to an
ancestress of Donna Pomposa that the ancient
Firbolg sarcasm, “ Aisy, O woman of three cows!”
arose. However that may be, it soon became
evident that the indefatigable affability of Don
Adriano was almost neutralised by the arrogance
of his Lady. An eminent Baratarian colonist
from Hibernia said “it was a “neck-and-neck
race between them—only they were running in
opposite directions.”
# # #
Don Adriano —who pathetically admitted
that he “ was not a brilliant man”—slowly became
aware of this, and redoubled his efforts to gain
popularity. Although he came of a race who
“joked with difficulty,” he set himself seriously
to learn the construction of the freaks of language
called jokes, and took several specimens to pieces
in order to study their inner works. When he
thought he knew enough about them, he ventured
to make a few on his own account, in order to
amuse the Baratarians, but they received them in
such a cold and clammy manner that he became
discouraged, and relapsed into his natural condi-
tion of amiable melancholy. Shortly after his
arrival in his pro-consulate, he was called upon to
take the leading part in certain high functions
wherein the former Governor —a grandee with an
imposing beard and large presence—had greatly
distinguished himself. One of these was the
opening of the Baratarian Parliament. The
former Governor, in carrying out this ceremony,
looked like a civilised Moses in gorgeous uniform
reading from the tables of the law ; Don Adriano,
with his small, beardless face, looked like a dis-
guised girl whose head had been shaven, and who
was ashamed of the fact, and wanted to hide
herself under an enormous gold-laced cooked-hat.
He was a disappointment as a national spectacle.
There was no pomp about him and he knew it’
It was the same when he got on horseback to re-
view the army. People said he reminded them of
a Baratarian shrimp —a species of Crustacean
which, curiously enough, was only to bo obtained
in Barataria in a tinned state. But Don Adriano
was ambitious, and did not lose heart because of
these failures. He endeavoured to make up for
his want of size by his ubiquity, and rushed to and
fro in his province, opening everything that came
in his way, from a church to a watch-house and
smiling epileptically. He listened heroically to
the_ speeches of fat Alcades with suet-pudding
brains who first patronised him on account of his
youth and then grovelled at his feet in their own
slaver because of his rank. But the stress of all
this was telling upon him. His fairy soul was
visibly fretting its way through its little tenement
of clay at too fast a rate. He was growing to look
like the ghost of an obituary poet.
# * #
Don Adriano returned to his palace one
evening after a day laborious of affability and
found two eminent doctors, who had been sent for
by Donna Pomposa, waiting for him in the hall.
“We must keep those people in their places,” said
the haughty Eirbolg heiress.
“Come out of the draught, gentlemen,” whis-
pered Don Adriano apologetically, and led them
into a side-room. “We shall not be observed
here,” he added, closing the door. “Now, may I
enquire what your business may be ?”
“ Will your Excellency,” said one of them, “ be
good enough to open ”
“With pleasure,” interrupted Don Adriano,
smiling wearily, “ It is my business. I have done
nothing but open things since I arrived here.
What do you wish me to open ? ”
“Your mouth, my Lord,” replied the leading
doctor, sternly.
“Certainly, gentlemen,” said Don Adriano,
MELANCHOLY RESULT OF THE MELBOURNE GAS STRIKE.
“ but, as I am tired, I hope you will excuse me
from opening it with a speech.”
He opened it —and the doctors gazed, awe-
struck, at the ruin within.
“Your Excellency will either have to give up
trying to become popular or give up your Go-
vernorship,” solemnly observed both of the medical
men, after they had somewhat recovered from the
shock.
“ Neither,” exclaimed the Governor, firmly. “ I
will die at my post, smiling to the last—so.”
He slowly uncovered his teeth in his “No. 7

shuddered, and fled.

Don Adriano grew worse. One day the
postman brought a dirty envelope to the palace,
which contained the following letter :—
Mud Puddle.
To His Rile Hiness the Guvner.
Dear Lord, —Ime goin’ to start as a pubblikin in this
risin’ township to-morrer, and want you to cum andhopen
the ’otel.—Yours trooly, Bob Peters.
P.S.—Don’t fale, and bring your kilts. There will be
dansin’.
Don Adriano went, and returned with a large
cold that settled upon his small chest and caused
him almost to cough his little head off. But he
stuck manfully to what he considered to be his
duty, and, when he crawled out of his vice-regal
bed next morning, went into his reception-room
to attend to the usual levee of persons who came
there every day to ask him if he would open some-
thing or other. He sent them all away with an
amiable reply in the affirmative till only two were
left.
The first of these —a fat man, in broad-cloth—
advanced, and said : “ Your Hexcellency, I repre-
sent the firm of Hitch and Sons, the great Insecti-
cide Importers. We have received a large con-
signment of a noo brand, and would feel deeply
obliged if your Hexcellency would come round to
our establishment to-morrow and hopen a tin. A
silver tin-hopener will be specially provided for
the occasion.”
Don Adriano murmured that nothing would
give him greater delight than to _ assist, in his
humble way, the noble crusade carried on by In-
secticide-importers, more especially as he came
from a country where a great nobleman had
become immortalised among the people for his
hostility to insects, in the famous phrase, “ God
pleas the Duke of Argyle !”
The fat man went away beaming, and told the
head-clerk of Hitch and Sons, when he got back to
the establishment, that “those who said His
Hexcellency was not a born horator were basses !”
The second was a young man with a sodden
complexion, furtive features, and a general air of
gaudy decay. He came forward, and, stretching
out an unwashed claw in which was a small box,
remarked, “Beg yer Lordship’s pardon, but I’m
uny a pore orphan just arrived in this collarny,
an’ bearin' that you do all the hopenin’ business
’ere I thort I wud cum and arst you to hopen this
’ere match-box. I’ll bet you five quid you don’t,
and if you win I’ll shout for the bloomin’ aidey-
congs. There, now—that’s a sportin’ offer from
one gentleman to another !”
“This is the last straw,’’ gasped Don Adriano,
and fell down in a dead faint.
* * *
Don Adriano did not die, after all. He is
still Governor of Barataria, and still pitter-patters
around in his amiable little way, but all who know
him say that he will never be the same carefully-
mended ruin he was before receiving this shock.
He is growing more spectral every day, and will
probably fade away till there is nothing left of
him but a hollow cough before his time of office is
up. Adios, Don Adriano de Speranza !
CREEVE ROE.
The mistress of a French rustic landowner,
having proved unfaithful to him, he called
up his servant, informed him that it was his inten-
tion to kill himself, and requested, after his
death, that he would make a candle of his fat, and
carry it, lighted, to his mistress. Then he shot
himself, and the faithless rascal of a servant
refused to boil him down.
Dr. Hodgkinsou, of the N. Z. Parliament,
is not a celebrated man, but he seems likely to
become so at an early date. His latest exploit
was to enter his indignant protest against all
legislation for the protection of woman, on the
ground that she was and always had been suffi-
ciently protected by “the innate chivalry of man.”
Our opinion of the chivalry of man or any other
animal never was very high, and Hodgkinson has
not done much to elevate it. We have read about
a period not long past when females were hanged
for stealing a loaf, and when that branch of chi-
valry died out, man developed a capacity for
making woman sew shirts in an attic for seven-
teen hours a day, and paid her at the rate of Bs. a
week for her exertions, and if she didn’t keep on
sewing shirts till she died it was because she had
the good fortune to marry some honourable citizen
who probably pounded her almost to death with a
poker. No—the chivalry of man never amounted
to very much, nor did the chivalry of woman
either, for that matter. To see a respectable
Christian female, with a feeling heart, wallop a
tired horse along uphill, where the roads are stony
and rough, is a sight to make gods and angels
weep, and when she has banged the last hair off
the unhappy animal she will go and shed tears
over an idiotic maiden in a book, and only wake
up to realities in time to find that the second
youngest child is on fire, and the baby is sitting
down in a plate of hot hash.

“Please, God, Untie My Bonnet-Strings.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One day in pensive mood I walked
A-musing over many things,
When on my ears there fell a voice—
“Please, God, untie my bonnet-strings !”
A little maid, with puckered face
And troubled air (for trouble wings
Its way, alas ! to little hearts) —
“Please, God, untie my bonnet-strings!”
Down by the dusty road she knelt,
Outwearied by her wanderings ;
Small hands were clasped, a small voice said,
“Please, God, untie my bonnet-strings !” ’
She turned her head to hear my step;
The trace of childish sufferings
Was in her eyes : she spoke once more—
“Please, God, untie my bonnet-strings !’
My stronger fingers soon had loosed
The knot which caused her ;
And off the maiden gaily ran,
While I mused over many things.
Surely, I thought, her childish faith
A more than childish lesson brings;
Can older heads learn nothing from
That little maid’s imaginings ?
Were it not well sometimes to say,
When tired of life’s meandering,s,
“Father, wo cannot find the clue—
Please, God, untie our bonnet-strings”?

Gym pic, Q,
Albuminuria.
or Bright’s Disease, is one of the most deadly
complaints that attack debilitated constitutions.
Owing to over exertion and over consumption
of nerve force, the system becomes gradually-
weakened and relaxation sets in. The thin mem-
branes of the kidneys are the first to go, and
medical authorities state that 50 per cent, of the
deaths, nowadays, occur indirectly from Bright’s
Disease though the patients and their medical
advisers never even suspected the presence of such
a deadly foe. The function of the kidney is to
separate the waste fluids from the blood, to purify
it, and this process is carried on by what is termed
by physiologists, “osmosis.” In weakened systems
the membranes become relaxed, and the albumen
of the blood finds its way with the waste fluids
through the kidney walls, and passes from the
body with the urine; the patient’s health and
strength thus gradually failing. Beyond the
presence of albumen in the water, Albuminuria
has not any positive symptoms; but general weak-
ness, which always leads to these serious disorders,
always signifies its presence by special signs, you
may get headache, spasmodic toothache, torturing
neuralgia, pain in small of the back, disinclination
to work, heavy, aching limbs on waking in the
morning, bloodshot eyes, poor appetite, or con-
stipation. These warning symptoms must not be
neglected, or as sure as a rat hole will sink a ship,
so sure will the patient’s life bo sacrificed The
remedy indicated is Clements Tonic, this will
restore all organs to a proper, healthy state,
and ensure correct performance of the processes of
digestion, assimilation, perspiration, secretion,
and elimination. Clements Tonic has a record of
cures effected such as no other medicine ever
secured, and we arc willing to prove our rep-
resentations by outside evidence.
Mr. Thomas Garrett, M.P., in speaking of our
remedy says; “I have taken Clements Tonic
with very great advantage.”
W. H. East, Esq., “Stanthorpe,”Dulwich Hill,
says: “I took three bottles of Clements Tonic
and am wonderfully improved, and have had no
return of the excruciating headaches since.
Mr. W. D. Braham, the crack tailor of King-
street, Sydney, speaks of it in the highest terms
of praise.
Sydney Cunningham, Esq., 71, Watkin-street,
Newtown, says : “I and my family have used
Clements Tonic with great success, and strongly
recommend it.”
Mrs. George Hilliard, King-street, Newtown,
writes that she has given it a fair trial, and can
testify to its great value.
We shall be glad to furnish sufferers with the
names and addresses of scores of our patrons who
have derived great benefit from our wonderful
remedy on application, to F. M. Clements, New-
town.
Full particulars and endorsements on appli-
cation to F. M. Clements, Newtown, N.S.W.;
at Melbourne, George and George; at Adelaide,
S. A. Mutual Stores 98 Waymouth-street; at
Wellington (N.Z.), Sharland & Co., and Laun-
ceston, J. D. Johnstone; and all dealers every-
where.
The Bulletin has a complaint to make
against Illustrated Bits (London). In the first
place, it objects to be credited by Bits with hog-
wash which has never appeared in The Bulletin
columns, while its good, original matter is either
quoted unacknowledged or credited to other papers.
That Kyneton (Vic.) hospital patient who
had two ounces of his brain removed is getting on
favourably. Possibly if the rest of his brain had
also been removed, the result would have been
much the same. It is an open question whether
brains are a necessity after all. There is a goblin
tale of a Spanish physician who chloroformed a
criminal, kindly lent to him by the Government,
and scooped out the whole of his thinking organ,
leaving his skull a mere dry shell like a hollow
Salvation drum. The patient never bothered him-
self about anything after that. He never thought
or listened or saw or tasted or smelt —he simply
lay on a sofa and breathed for twenty years, and
his proprietor blew his victuals into him through
a blow-pipe, and used to open the silver lid which
formed the top of his head and allow his scientific
friends to inspect the empty void within, and
sometimes he would heave a pound of dry peas
into the cavity to hear them rattle. Finally, how-
ever, the doctor died and left the ruined auto-
maton on the sofa to his successor; and that
gentleman grew tired of it, and rolled the pro-
perty downhill one dark night, and it was never
heard of again. Possibly it is lying at the bottom
of that hill and breathing right ahead to this day.

A certain Australian minor Judge declares
that if a man is lucky enough to possess money he

And yet rumour says the same learned Judge is

Rev, Mr. Marsden, says a contemporary,
filled the incumbency of St. John’s, Parramatta,
from 1789 to 1838; Rev. Mr. Booart from 1838 to
1854, Rev. Canon King from 1855 to 1867, and
Venerable Archdeacon Giinther from that date to
the present. Thus the parish has only had four
incumbents in the course of a century,

The Princess of Wales attended service

nounced the benediction.
The late Judge Williams, of the Victorian
Supreme Court, father of his present Honor of
that name, was one of the laziest and most im-
patient men who ever sat upon a Bench., Once he
had before him in a long argument H. 0. Chap-
man (afterwards a S.C. judge in N.Z.) “You

Rip Van Winkle Frencharn, who has beeil

Just upon 40 years ago did Frencharn benefit the

Frencharn, and kept dark, as they tried to do on
Suitor’s ranche, in California.
When Queen Victoria was about to marry
she was anxious to have the rank and title of King
Consort conferred by Act of Parliament on Prince
Albert. Lord Melbourne thought the proposal an
unwise one, and tried to pass it off. The Queen,
however, persisted, and at last Lord Melbourne
said : “ Let us hear no more of it, Madam. If
you once get the English people into the way of
making kings, you will get them into the way of
unmaking them.”

he is physically fitted to stand the wear and tear
of even a stonewalling session, and has some
few brains. His friends call him “Honest Tom,”
but his honesty isn’t any more conspicuous than
that of the average man. Probably he earned
the title because his bluntness and coarse force of
character indicate that if roguery be present in
his character it is of the less cunning sort.
Frawncis Habigle is now on his return
journey to Horsetrailyer- Says a Dublin paper :
An Orange soiree was given in the Round Room of the
Rotunda on Monday to celebrate the “bi-centenary of the
Battle of the Boyne.” The Grand Master of the City of
Dublin Lodge presided. The majority of those present
were ladies. The room was decorated with orange lilies
and representations of skulls and crossbones, &e. A
selection of brethren forming parallel lines crossed hands
and a silly-looking procession, headed by the chairman,
carrying a closed Bible and a lily, marched between the
lines. Speeches followed from Colonel Waring, M.P., the
Rev. R. R. Kane, and a tourist named Abigail from New
South Wales. The last-named speaker described himself
as a member of Parliament from a self-governing colony,
condemned ’Ome Rule for Ireland, eulogised “lor and
border,” and moved a vote of thanks to Lord ’Artington.
That speaker was evidently Frawncis.

The gas-stokers’ strike went very near to

quarrel is now forgotten, and henceforth the gifted
Winter will be careful not to tread on the corns

“The working man’s paradise and the

One of two things must soon be faced by

Yates writes that a certain gentleman is

Sir Benjamin Benjamin, as a candidate

The alleged ladies range against the women,
and the alleged gentlemen against the men. One

now it has come to pass. Adelaide papers please
copy.
“Divorce” Shields is looked upon as the
Attorney-General of any coming Victorian Go-
vernment that may supplant the cunning barnacle,
Gillies.
Melbourne democratic prejudice against
the Employers’ Union was aggravated by the
news that the sharks of the Law Institute wished
to join in a body and protect the sacred rights of
capital.
There is a big scandal in the Victorian
Lands Department. Civil servants are taking up
laud, and refuse to take action against non-com-
plying lessees, fearing their own little plots may
be endangered.
The N.S.W. Government has resolved to
barricade Circular Quay, Sydney, in order to
facilitate work by non-unionists. From a French
point of view it is very bad to set the example of
erecting barricades.
The Playford Ministry is certainly not
wanting in variety. It contains two lawyers, a
market gardener, farmer, brewer and the usual
journalist. No Ministry can live without a
journalist for ballast.
The N.S.W. Trades and Labour Council’s
offer of a thousand special constables has con-
siderably incensed those who hoped that the
leaders of the trades-unions would incite their
men to break the peace.
Murray Smith says : “There was a time
when the cause of Labour was righteous.” This
to the Melbourne Employers’ Union. Now when
was the cause of Labour righteous ? During the
centuries and ages that it was ground under the
! i oel of Capital ?
Judging from what fell from the lips of the
delegates at the Railway Conference dinner, Vic-
toria and South Australia are satisfied with the
rule of their Commissioners, while N.S. Wales
and Queensland are not.
Preparations for the social revolution are
quietly proceeding in England. One of the great
objects to be attained by the short hours’ cam-
paign is the finding of time to enable workmen to
be drilled in the volunteer and militia forces.
Dillon, M.P., upholds the boycott and
defies the Pope. Healy, M.P., says that Irish
tenants who pay their rents and allow their fami-
lies to starve, are assassins; also that Australia is
at present really only helping to fill the landlords’
pockets.
At the forthcoming elections in Western
Australia, the widening of the new Constitution
will be prominently brought before the electors.
Already a number of candidates are advocating
the introduction of manhood suffrage and the
abolition of the property qualifications for candi-
dates.
Lieutenant-Governor Sir Alfred Stephen’s
Bill, punishing with fine or imprisonment the act
of “endeavouring to induce men not to work,”
constitutes a piece of impudent, but impotent,
tyranny, which would have adorned a lag-time
proclamation by Governor Darling. It simply
smells of Port Arthur.
Recent statistics show that the greatest
number of women, in proportion to population,
employed in industrial occupations in European
countries is found in the United Kingdom, the
number so employed being 4,500,000, per cent age

and France shows 9 'B9.
The latest mutiny in the British army has
broken out among the Hussars stationed at Canter-
bury, where Thomas a’Beckett lies buried and
Henniker Heaton enjoys their votes and interest.
We expect to hear that Henniker has been sent
down to the old Cathedral city “ to infuse a spirit
of loyalty ” into the troops.
The Employers’ Union has asked the press
to discontinue calling blackleg labour by its pre-
sent name, and demands that in future it bo
termed “ free labour,” Any paper which calls
blackleg labour “ free ” is lying by inference, in-
asmuch as it is lending itself to the insinuation
that to be a trades-unionist is to be a slave.
In a congratulatory letter to Mr. C. Teece,
on his election for Goulburn, that fine, old fisher
of men,” Premier Parkes, says : “ I earnestly hope
that your service in Parliament may be a long
service of honour and usefulness.” In other
words, Parkes hopes that Teece will form another
joint in his tail. An old dog for a hard road.
The Australian Intercolonial Railway Con-
ference among delegates from the various railway
associations have declared that “48 hours per week
should be the maximum hours of labour for all
positions of continuous work, and that every hour
worked over and above that number should be paid
for at overtime rates, such rate not to be less than
time-and-a-half. ”
Little Lord Hopetoun, playing the role of
bucolic magnate at the Melbourne Agricultural
Show luncheon, twanged forth: “My pursuits,
my pleasures, my business, my means of supply,
have all come from the country.” Hopetoun’s
business is something we now hear of for the first
time, but there can be no question as to his means
of supply coming from the country ;
O lordship, it can’t be denied
(Except with a lie)
The country is doomed to provide
Your means of supply.
’Tis plain, as you languidly ride
In a chariot by,
You never were built to provide
Your means of supply.
Your game it is putting on “side”
And snubbing small fry
Whose duty it is to provide
The means of supply.
A democrat’s temper is tried,
He asks with a sigh
“ How long are poor folks to provide
Those means of supply ?”
From morning until eventide
One cannot tell why—
Men labour, Lord H., to provide
Your means of supply.
Two halves of this universe wide
Are joined by a tie,
For each has to help to provide
Your means of supply.
Yourself and your nice-looking bride,
With the bright, merry eye,
Can laugh while the others provide
Your means of supply.
In plenty and peace ye abide,
Though things go awry
With them who have got to provide
Your means of supply.
A landlord or Gov. may be “ guyed ”
For his stupidity,
Yet still do the scoffers provide
His means of supply.
The cause of old-family pride.
Your Excellen-cy,
Is the fact that it doesn’t provide
The means of supply.
A son, when your spirit is skied,
(That is, if you die)
You’ll leave, for our sons to provide
With means of supply.
Unless busy bees shall decide,
In the sweet bye-and-bye,
No longer the drones to provide
With means of supply.

There was lately in the N.S.W. force an
enthusiastic constable who holds the record for
the arrest of drunks, of whom in one day he
unassistedly “ ran-in ” 27. His mode of procedure
was invariably to “give ’em a heavy fall and
knock the wind out of ’em.” After a most
hilarious career he resigned. This industrious
constable, by the way, used to carry a revolver !

A statement appears on page 4 of Lloyd’s
Weekly Newspaper, dated 13th July, 1890, on
the authority of the British Consul at Brussels,
that no M.D. diploma has been issued from the
University of that city for 29 years. Surely this
cannot be true, as quite a number of medical men
are practising in Australia upon, among other
qualifications, diplomas purporting to have
emanated from Brussels University within the
last ten years.

Melbourne Exhibition turns out a frost
and a fraud, with £241,000 deficit. Cowen’s
orchestra concerts cost £30,000, and realised
£9,000. Deakin declared in Parliament, before-
hand, that the Exhibition could not cost more
than £20,000 ! The official reason for the failure
is “deadheadism.” But then it would take
4,820,000 shillings to represent £241,000 deficiency.

Out of five recent Sydney defaulters, three

Is H.R.H. Tummy once more in the thrall
of the shent-per-shenters ? London “ Sassiety ”
is shocked at the fact that Albert Edward honours,
above all others of his set, Baron Hirsoh, a vulgar
foreign financier. Which reminds us of an old-
time Melbourne reporter, who used to shine at
social festivities, such as the Mayor’s ball, or the
Masonic annual, as representative of the Age.
The day before any such function he would wait
upon a celebrated Hebrew usurer, who had
social ambitions for his daughter, and plead,
“ My dear Mr. Fahcksrnore, have I your permis-
sion to take Miss Fahcksrnore to the ball to-
morrow evening ? I have tickets for two, and can
introduce her to all the people present worth
knowing.” The financier would “ Gott-bless-you-
my-poy,” and cordially assent. Then the scribe
would put in a good time, behave most affec-
tionately towards the young lady, and in a day or
two wait on the smiling father to discount his bill.
And, what’s more, he pulled it off every time.
When, one fine afternoon, Mr. Fahcksrnore heard
that his gallant young literary acquaintance had
skedaddled to Queensland, leaving many lament-
ing creditors, he burst into tears and said, “My
poor monish ! Tam tose reporter coves, dey vhas
all schwindlefrauds, und ven der hat vhas on der
roof vhas covered. ” The gallant rep. has since
developed a middle-aged embonpoint, but the Mel-
bourne hawks have never seen him since. Queens-
land is still his home.

Here is a little gratis hint for any one who
happens to want to make £5O without earning it.
In an issue of a week or two back, a Sydney
daily inadvertently published a “lost and
found ” advertisement about an overcoat, stating
that if the thing was returned “no questions
would be asked,” or something of the sort, and
thereby became liable for a £5O penalty, to anyone
who likes to sue for it. Now, here is a chance for
the Sunday-informer class to organise a little
syndicate.

A fast young squatter was not long ago
settled by an indulgent mother on a neat little
Riverina station-property. Finding himself hard-
up some months before shearing he negotiated with
a well-known wool-broking firm to sell the clip on
the sheep’s back. An agent was sent-up to inspect
with power to close, a price was agreed upon,
whisky and cards were introduced, and ere the
daylight next morning the young squatter found
himself minus the wool and the £4850 he had
obtained for it!

There is something in a name after all.
The brother of a clerical gentleman who recently
figured in an Australian divorce-suit announces,
per the press, that ho has changed his surname.
The giddy cleric —now that he is free to do so—
should follow this up by going one better —chang-
ing not only his own surname, but that of the lady
whose name he has managed to compromise.
Col. Templeton’s idea of charging 100
guineas for “strain” and “overtime” is by no
means original. We remember seeing a bill
rendered by a country carpenter to a Municipal
Council, which ran thus :

The Victorian railway officials dragged up
a mechanic, a few days ago, on a charge of owing
them three-halfpence for a railway-ticket, and
when the bench inquired why they hadn’t also
brought up the 150 merchants, clergymen, and
capitalists who were found defrauding the revenue
in the same way some three months back, the
prosecuting lawyer suggested that most likely that
gang had all given wrong names and addresses
and so couldn’t be found. Any one who can fancy
Parkes sitting conspicuously on the Treasury
bench, and no one able to find him because he had
given a wrong name and address, will understand
to the full magnificence of this explanation.

Miss Gresley, the daughter of a banker, and in
her virginal days was an attractively exuberant
young lady. According to the tale told to the
public ear, the impressionable medico proposed
and then “ hung fire ” for over a year, which the
yearning widow couldn’t stand. The annoying
part of it is that the lawyers, after bringing the
case before Judge Webb, and empannelling an
expectant jury, quietly patched up the quarrel and
announced that the affair had been settled, with-
out letting any of the terms of settlement leak
out. What “sassiety” is morbidly curious to
know now is—will he marry her? If not, how
much chinky consolation does she put in that un-
disco verable pocket of hers ?

One of the things which want to be put
down is that person who signs her name in the

proceeds to enter her husband and her father and
mother, and all the family, and the baby, and the
dog, and her married sister-in-law, and all their
joint and several ancestors back to the Deluge.
Asa rule, she thinks nothing of keeping eighteen
people waiting while she writes up all these par-
ticulars, and all these people use strong language
about her, and wonder if the book will prove large
enough to hold the details, and the flunkey in the
background glares at her with derision. And then,
when she has finished her labours, and gone off
with a firm conviction that she will receive twenty
cards of invitation to the next ball, an official steps
for ard with a hoarse chuckle and draws his pen
through the entire list. Many a stout, combustible
female named Stubbs or Thompson would save
herself a lot of tears and mortification in the
future by casting her inflamed eye over this para-
graph.

The efforts of the employers to have their

been already anticipated by the other side. Down
on the Oastlereagh occurred the following dialogue.
A Sydney man fresh from the town asked a
bronzed old shearer : “ Are there many non-union
shearers in this district?” “There ain’t any,”
was the reply. “No non-union shearers !” said
the other; “I thought there were plenty of them
hereabouts.” “ Look here, sonny,” said the
ancient impressively, “ there’s only two sorts _ of
shearers —Union and Scab. If a man ain’t Union
he’s Scab. There’s no such thing as a non-union
shearer.” i

Time out of mind a tradition has existed
among educated people to the effect that professors
scarcely ever wash themselves all over. When
this arose it would be hard to say—perhaps in the
days of the Scotists and Thomists when professors
were too much interested in arguing whether
names were things, or merely names, to spare time
for personal ablutions. No doubt there was some
foundation for it. The great Person is a case in
point, not to mention the greater Immanuel Kant,
who saw no reason for washing himself, as he
never perspired. Professor M‘Coy, of the Mel-
bourne University, is, however, a living contra-
diction to the truth of this tradition. He lives at
Brighton, and takes a bath in the sea every morn-
ing in the year. As Professor M‘Coy has never
been suspected of fanaticism on any point, other
reasons have been assigned for this extraordinary
conduct. Some people say that he is carrying it
on for a wager; others that he performs it as a
penance for some unconfessed crime, such as killing
a rival naturalist, who had discovered anew kind
of beetle, and appropriating the discovery to him-
self ; and a yet larger division hint that ho is
financially interested in Brighton as a bathing
resort, and bathes every morning as an advertise-
ment.

I tried to heat my hands
At the great fire of life, so warm to touch,
And closer crouched before the blazing brands,
Nor felt| their genial radiance over-much.
But, bending nearer to the beckoning brands.
Upleapt they treacherous and seared my hands.
I bared my heart to life’s cool, tempting breeze
To fan upon the passions it had known,
The tears, the terrors, and the secresies,
With all the sear of sorrows, borne alone.
But the cool breeze turned icy in its part
And froze the life-blood in my bare, hot heart.
I shut my heart to it and clasped my hands ;
No breeze should harm me now, nor cruel brands.
But loud laughed life in fiendish mockery
And echoed —echoed —all it knew of me.
What wot it that I hide my burning palms ?
What wot it that love’s debt is never paid ?
Beneath the mask life knows the storms and
calms,
And ridicules the cynic she has made.

Governor Hopetoun has opened up a great
deposit of solemn thought by the statement he
likes Australia, and has “no desire to go home.”
We expect he has not. At home he is only a
peer, and not a very large one either; in Aus-
tralia he is a deputy-monarch, and feels as if h e
weighed a ton. Also, he is the Fount of Mercy,
which probably agrees with him, and he has a
palace .and a salary, and the provincial mayors
entertain him, and take him round the bone-
crushing establishments, and show him 50 tons of
old scrap fat and bad eggs that are waiting to be
boiled down, and read him addresses, and he has
a good time generally. Governor Bowen, how-
ever, struck a brighter inspiration still; at every
town he visited he used to state that the one thing
that he longed for above all other earthly con-
siderations was to be buried there, and sleep in
the picturesque local cemetery till the day of
resurrection. And the tears come into our eyes
when we think that this humble ambition missed
fire. He hasn’t been buried yet.
Some ridiculous person advertises in a
Northern paper that he has “A Good Home for a
Christian Youth who has been to sea and can make
himself useful about the house ; C.E. and English
preferred.” Likewise, small appetite will be
regarded with favour, we presume ; furthermore,
a contempt for filthy lucre in the form of wages
will be hailed as an outward evidence of inward
Kerristianity. Christianity, also Religious Fer-
vour, is a good excuse for meanness, and a never-
failing substitute for ready cash. Amen !
Bookstall Smith, first Lord of the Ad-
miralty, is to be elevated to the peerage. The
British peerage is pretty nearly all Smith now,
except that part of it which is thinly-disguised
Jones. Some of it made his pile out of pills, and
some of it deait in coal and old bones, and another
section was in the slop-clothing industry, and the
rest got into the aristocracy on account of its
Grandmother's immorality. But the legend still
liolds out that it was descended from some pic-
turesque baron who came out strong in ancient
times, and the British sycophant, who worships
old descent, holds it in reverence on account of
the pedigree which it hasn’t got, and bows down
oefore the peer of ancient lineage whose mother
was named Jemimar Harm, and manufactured
pies. And so when Smith attains to the peerage
it will presently be rumoured that he is lineally
descended from Johannes Smithianus, who was
short in his cash in the days of Julius Caesar and
had to clear out in consequence, or else it will
transpire that he is directly descended from
Balaam’s Ass, and he will be respected accordingly.
Dear Bulletin.—l have seen your “ par.”
that Millar Bros, have tired of Chinese miners’
labour and have replaced them with Euro-
peans. That is hardly correct. The Euro-
pean miners lately introduced to the Northern
Territory only relieved the former workmen,
who are now down your way along with their
manager. Millar still hangs to the yellow man,
and must have 50 to 00 of them doing various jobs
on his ground. The claims are looking tip-top so
far, and I fancy the idea of the Millars is to split
them up into sections and float in England. I
may be wrong in this, but circumstances point to
that belief. It will probably suit the owners, but
for the country I, for one, will regret such a course.
We have had numerous companies working ground
here, but none have held out, and the last has just
gone bung. Too much money goes to London for
“officers;” the management is done from Lon-
don ; cables cost money; and the whole system
has been proved by us to be rotten as Royalty
itself. Millars have a remarkably good thing, and
no doubt they will ask big figures when they part
with it. You must understand that up to now
their expenditure cannot have been less than
£20,000, and they show good work for it.—Yours
faithfully, G.M. Fort Darwin, N.T.

A Rambling Complaint.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
You can talk as you may,
And think as you like,
I mean what I say—
I’m sick of the strike ;
Which side is the wrong,
Or which side is right,
I’d care not as long
As they left me a light.
I work with my hand—
At the end of a pen :
I belong to the band
Of the labouring men ;
I don’t use a spade,
Or perform with the pick,
And I am not afraid
To admit that I’m sick.
It isn’t my lot
To go stoking up coal,
Yet I graft till I’ve got,
Ah ! a pain in the soul;
My ballad to-night
To comrades who stoke
Is give me a light—
I’ll give you a joke.
I’ll stand, as I’ve stood,
By the side of each mate
Who works for the good
Of himself and the State;
But I likewise remark
To each Billy and Dick—
To be left in the dark
Makes a journalist sick.
Trades-Union hands
Don’t monopolise toil,
The mainstay of lands
Are the tillers of soil;
If those hai’dy sons
Of Labour, says I,
Didn’t stick to their guns
We should jolly well die.
If all struck at once
At a Trades leader’s shout,
It is plain to a dunce
We must soon peter-out;
I am tyranny’s fo3,
Be it little or great
’Tis a duty I owe
To the good of the State.
You can talk as you may,
And think as you like,
I mean what I say—
I am sick of the strike
(Though probably right
At the time it began)
If it puts out the light
Of a labouring man.

Turkey wants England to lix a date for the
carrying-out of the frequently-sworn promise to
evacuate Egypt. Salisbury coolly replies; “It
would be premature for England to evacuate
Egypt at the present time.” The British bond-

J. Bull to do justice towards the weak.
A speaker at the N.S.W. Railway Con-
ference the other evening cracked the old chestnut
that “Parliaments are what the people make
them.” As a matter of fact, while plural-voting
exists Parliaments can only be what the allotment-
voters of the community make them. The speaker,
perhaps, dimly apprehended this when he said
later on that he hoped the day was coming when
Labour would be more fully represented.
What is the matter with the Northumber-

That 10,000 of the most sturdy men under Heaven

which either sit on the fence or are avowedly their
deadly enemies passes all comprehension. New-
castle and district is quite big enough to hand-
somely maintain a small, but live, Radical evening

The Land of the Crocodile.
Two native blacks recently walked osten-
tatiously into a public-house in Roma. Both had
on clean shirts and new pants. They marched up
to the bar and ordered “ two fella rum,” with the
easy grace and professional confidence of the
highest type of civilised shearer. The landlord
thought they were two troopers out of uniform, or
a couple of regular station-boys come to town with
a little surplus cash. They drank three rums in
succession, and then slowly sauntered to' the door.
The landlord called out, “ Hi! come back ! Baal
you been pay me ! ” And the elder darkie
replied, “ 'Bright, old man! pay be damn ! We
trust you!” Then the jovial myalls marched
gaily off, serenely happy in the knowledge of the
Act which imposes a heavy penalty on publicans
supplying liquor to aboriginals. And yet the
Presbyterian Church of Australia cherishes a mis-
guided belief that the Queensland blacks are
deficient in the first principles of modern
Christianity.

The first Queensland fossils of extinct

The first caucus meeting of the Liberal
party, after Griffith selected his Ministry, was one
of the liveliest on record. The union of the two
knights, and the happy burying of the old steel-
rail war hatchet, was a rude shock to the partisan
bigots among Griffith’s followers. He was at-
tacked by the bigots from motives of bigotry, and
by others who were mad because their transcen-
dental qualifications for office had been overlooked.
Groom was one of the most relentless critics of the
Coalition. Only national disaster could follow the
omission of his name as Minister for Lands.
Griffith surveyed him with unspeakable thoughts,
and an et tu Groome expression. And at the close
of the caucus, Griffith, in atone remarkable for its
intense sincerity, consigned the Toowoomba schis-
matic to a region where molten platina is usually
mistaken for ice-cream.

The Whip of the Coalition Ministry is
“Jack” Annear, one of the members for Mary-
borough. Jack would likely have been Minister
for Railways but that his sympathetic good nature
was not deemed proof against the unscrupulous
assaults of deputations, and melancholy men, and
lovely women in distress. He is quite satisfied
with the position of whip, as it entails no neglect
of his own business. His political income is re-
presented by £3OO as member and £350 as whip—
nearly three-fourths the salary of a Minister.
Jack‘Hamilton, member for Cooktown, will still
act as whip for the party now gone into opposi-
tion. Jack is one of the best boxers and best
swordsmen in Australia. He was the “ best man”
among ten thousand at the Palmer rush. Both
“ whips ” are honourable men, not in the least
likely to take any mean advantage, and each is
the best man his party could possibly select.

Not vei’y long ago a love-sick officer in the
North Queensland native police sent a specimen
of what he believed to be a new plant to Bailey,
the Colonial Botanist, with a request that it be
named after a beautiful Northern girl to whom he
was engaged to be married. He had a romantic
desire to pass his darling on to immortality as
Achyranthes Louisa, or BulbophyUurn Annie, or
some other simple poetic autograph that his
posterity would fall over in the dark and would
make them believe their grandmother was a
Greek princess or an ex-Queen of Madagascar,
sister of Ranovalomanjaka. While Bailey
was critically examining the new specimen
to ascertain the jaw-cracking order to which
it belonged, the girl, with the cold and
heartless fickleness characteristic of so many
daughters of Eve, forgot the absent lover, who was
away avenging the murder of a Oftinarnan among
the Northern myalls, and basely married a man
from Cooktown ! On the day this disastrous in-
telligence reached the police officer, and just as he
was about to rush off to wire to Bailey to call the
plant after his horse or his dog, or one of his black-
boys, a letter arrived from the Colonial Botanist
to say that the “ new specimen belongs to the
order Eygophyllcce, trihulus cistoides, a well-
known perennial procumbent plant, said to be
fatal to stock when eaten on an empty stomach.'
This second blow was fatal! The unhappy lover;
in the sudden frenzy of despair, called his faithful
troopers around him and plunged into the depths
of the forest, breathing slaughter against all forms
of life on this planet. No blacks have been seen
in the district since that eventful day, nor have
even the balance of the Chinamen been restored
to the bosom of their cabbage-beds.

Queensland is not a colony where the
Chinese leper enjoys a long life. His existence
here is not leased on any fixity of tenure. If he is
discovered in the interior of the colony, he rarely
ever reaches the coast. He starts for civilisation
in charge of a policeman who generally loses him
on the way down. When camped in some lonely
spot, the leper escapes in the night, rambles away
into the scrub and can never be found again. The
manner in which a clumsy, long-heeled China-
man, whose toes have unanimously dropped off,
manages to conceal his tracks and defy the eyes
of the keenest trackers, is a mystery not yet lucidly
explained. I can remember two lepers who
vanished in this remarkable manner. They were
in charge, on each occasion, of a powerful police-
man and two black troopers. Yet both escaped
in the scrub country, and successfully baffled their
pursuers ! Probably they fell down a stump-hole
or were carried off by a cassowary. While some
poet composes a little poem to the memory of
those poor lost Chinamen, I may record my
earnest appreciation of the many valuable services

By the amalgamation of the “ Man about

the “Shifter,”and the “ Tale-Pitcher,” and all the
other dull-witted drunkards with whose gin-
scented breath and pimply eruptions the “Pink

London cab-drivers and noblemen of the Kim-

Book - hawkers in Kansas have been
earning an honest penny of late by travelling
round armed with a double-fountain pen and two
kinds of ink which are used thus : An agreement
is made out with a writing-fluid that fades, and
signed by the victim with ink that does not fade.
Then in the sacred seclusion of his own home the
book fiend substitutes an entirely different agree-
ment altogether, and the dupe finds himself
confronted with a promise to pay for articles he
never heard mentioned before.
A deputation of faded women of uncertain
age—past mistresses of the Social Gimlet-hole
Purity Society, and the Women’s Christian Tem-
perance Union, &c. —brought the severe batteries
of their prim charms to bear on Duncan Gillies,
the Victorian Premier, the other day, and asked
him to abolish all railway refreshment-rooms in
Victoria. Duncan blushed more redly than his
own hair, and sucked his thumb with cherubic,
infantile innocence. But the “ dears” didn’t got
there all the same, though Gillies is an inex-
perienced bachelor. Duncan, as a man who can
appreciate nectar on occasions, declared that there
were many people who believed they needed
“ better refreshment than water” on a journey, and
he wasn’t going to stop their travelling tipple.
“ Better refreshment ?” shrieked a staid young miss
of 69, “what can be better than God’s pure
water ?” And the sisterhood clung to each other
in mutual support, and told Duncan he was a
“ker-uel man” —“a nard-’earted ’edge’og” -“a
tempting fiend, ” Sic. Pearly tears, like dead fishes’
eyes, trembled in Gillies’s orbs a second, and then
fell with a rattle on his luncheon-tray. He could
only sob —“Boo-hoo, f’givc me, ladies ; I’m a lone
bachelor; boo-hoo, put your demands in writing.”
Then he fled from the room and rushed to the
Chief Secretary’s quarters, saying—“Alf., you’ll
have to receive those dogmad tabbies next time.”
Deakin peaked his goatee and said he didn’t mind.
Dear Bulletin, —ou tsaturuay, .me .Loth
August, Thargornindah (Q.) laughed until the
tears came. Sub-inspector Stuart arrived from
Charleville on the previous evening, and early on
this day rumour floated about that we might
expect to see some complicated military evolutions
in the police-enclosure; for Mr. Stuart’s wide
reputation for accomplishments in strategy and
tactics —a continuation of his renown as a com-
mander of blackfellows some years ago—had
preceded him here. Accordingly we were all on the
qui vive for a gaudy display, when about ten
o’clock we observed the saynyer-constable and
another policeman drawn up on the very cramped
verandah of the police-quarters. The inspector,
assisted by a sub-inspector, “sized” these two
men, then formed them into line, and opened the
ranks for inspection. He put them through small-
arms drill and, having marched the- pair down
from their perch on the verandah, through com-
pany and battalion drill also. One blackfellow
and half-a-dozen surveyors’ boring-rods were called
into requisition at this stage. The most ludicrous
episode was when the two police, with the black-
fellow and five boring-rods, formed as half
battalions in columns of double companies, with
the sub-inspector as right-marker to dress by.
One word of command we made note of was,
“ Column on the march, half-left-turn ” (this vyas
to steer clear of a certain small wooden erection
which was in the way). Another command was,
“From open intervals close upon the right of No.
1 Company.” Remember, through all this the
parade strength was five souls —the inspector and
his aide two policemen and a black-tracker, whose
pants were most rudimentary. Inspector Stuart
promises to visit us every three months unless the
exigencies of the State cab him to another sphere
of action. We look forward with expectancy to his
great November review.— Charleville.

Mind you get Wolfe’s Schnapps.
In the year 1880, one out of every 419

and all the abuse had to be printed at the Argus
office.

There was a remarkable tracing of typhoid

A London journal says : —“ Frederick
Beer, the Australian sculptor, now in Paris,
has discovered a process for making marble fluid

process is comparatively inexpensive.” This seems
to be playing low down on the Caleula “Marble
Man,” who was first in the field with the new dis-
covery.

A number of rabid Australian patriots are now
Attempting to attribute the Seventh Eleven failure to the
unfairness of English umpires, while a few of them go so
far a» 66 say that previous teams have been cheated out
of victories now and again. The Bulletin— which has
had reason to feel satisfied with its arguments and predic-
tions concerning Anglo-Australian cricket for some years
past—-is disgusted, rather than astonished, at the folly of
newspapers which encourage young simpletons to “put
it down to the umpire ” and print their balderdash under
the impression that the public at large desire such a
poisonous decoction of “ blow” to soothe their wounded
feelings. English umpires may, in some cases, show a
leaning towards their own people, but they are probably
as honest, take them altogether, as folks on this side of
i'uo water. At any rate, they don’t deserve such
asinine insinuations as we find published in the
Argus- A man writes to that solemn periodical:—
“ Another curious thing I noticed was the £25 given by a
sporting paper for the best batting and bowling average
to professionals, and where it was stated that five of the
fiowlers had formed a syndicate. It seemed to me that it
would also be an easy thing for the umpires to form a
syndicate in connection with the bowlers, and as the Aus-
tralians are a common enemy this may account for the
many bad decisions given, and in the majority of
oases where these leading howlers are in the syndicate.”
This is the merest schoolboy hogwash. The five bowlers
formed a syndicate because, playing on different parts of
the country, one might be working on a wet wicket while
the others were at a big disadvantage on dry ones. Seeing,
then, that either one of the five might be good e nough to
win the “pony,” with the assistance of a little bit of
luck, what they did was to agree to divide the luck and
the money with it. The idea of five bowlers, and Lord
knows how many umpires, forming a syndicate to “ cut
up” £25 is too ridiculous. There should he no occasion
for The Bulletin to point out once again that the alleged
Australian supremacy in cricket never did exist except in
heated young imaginations. The earlier of Murdoch’s
teams had “soft” things on as a rule, and seldom or
never met really representative English elevens. They
woke up cricket in the old country, however.
The professionals, long regarded as lazy fieldsmen
and mechanical bowlers, pulled themselves together,
and have kept together ever since. It is useless
to attack English umpires for the altered complexion put
upon Australian cricket. Two or three years ago we had
a couple of English elevens out here together, and each of
those teams played the Sixth Eleven on their native heath
and beat them decisively. Four or five years ago
Shrewsbury’s crowd came out here at the same time as the
returned Fifth Australian Eleven, and heat them, on the
Melbourne and Sydney grounds, in three successive
matches. Within seven years the writer has watched four
English teams play Victoria and “ Australia” on the Mel-
bourne C.O. ground, and has never yet had the satis-
faction of seeing the Britisher beaten, or nearly beaten.
Evidently Australian umpires must have favoured the
visitors. Let us put it down to the umpire.

Even the victory of Lord Hopetouu couldn’t

The Worship of Backers —the Melbourne Cup.

It was last week stated, on respectable Chow
authority, that the Chinese lottery hanks in Victoria
scoop an average daily profit of £225 amongst them.
£70,000 a year absorbed by these leprous syndicates, while
Sunday-school children are contributing their unwilling
pennies towards the conversion of pore heathen !

Lord Londesborough’s team, who start a match
(weather permitting) against the Australians to-day
(Sept. 4th), might better be described as “All England.”
With Shrewsbury in the place of Woods, the eleven would
seem the strongest that could have been chosen.

During a match with Denstone College, on the
Stafford County Cricket ground, a Mr. Ward hit the ball

compounded for 40 runs.

Nickalls, the winner in three successive years of
the Wingfield Sculls-the English amateur championship
rowed from Putney to Mortlake—was beaten easily this
year, his right arm having given way, by Gardner, the
man whom he defeated for the Diamond Sculls at Henley.

’Frisco for some years has had the boxing boom
all to itself, but it looks as if the venue is to be changed to
Sydney. The Sydney Club have been treating their
members to some first-class contests for months past.
Vankee Matthews brings off a genuine contest every
Saturday night at his hall; and now the N.S. Wales
Olympic Club has started in the old Darlinghuvst Skating
Rink, with Larry Foley and Jack Molloy as boxing in-
structors. The latter club offer a purse of 200 sovs. for the
light-weights, Mace, Dawson and Burge—or any trio of
men—to battle for.

An English writer says that had he been em-
ployed to select the All England Eleven that encountered
Australia at Lord’s, not one of the amateurs included
would have been chosen. Grace, he says, is now paste,
Walter Read is no longer at his best, and M'Gregor, the
most useful cricketer that Cambridge University owns, a
clever wicket-keep, against Woods or Blackham is little
more than a child.
* , # *
Pettengell, the New Zealand boxer, made a poor
show with Jack Molloy, of Sydney, at Sam Matthew’s
Hall on Saturday night. When Pettengell met the chain-
pion amateur, George Seale, he was merely a chopping-
block for the clever amateur. On Saturday night Molloy
fought for “ the point ” and artistically knocked b'“ man
out early in the second round.

It is said that Dreadnought is going to England
after the Melbourne Cup meeting. His full brother,
Wentworth, went there with the last batch of youngsters 1
and it will be interesting to learn definitely how his and
his companions’ nominations stand in the face of the death
of their nominator.

The first two to finish for the Sir Joseph Banks’
25th Handicap were James Tasker (33’> yards) and Thomas
Elliott (36J yards). It is said that Britisher Elliott has
only been on Australian soil since the beginning of the
year, and that the clever people at his back put him on a
baker’s cart at Wollongong ere bringing him out in several
“ Novice ” handicaps. However, the “ plant ” just missed
coming off, and the typical Queenslander, lean and long,
finished ahead of Elliott, a typical Britisher, round and
rosy.

Though the Harvard crew won the eight-oar
with Yale this year, they were by no means the champion
college crew, seeing that they, like Yale, persistently re-
fuse to meet Cornell University, “a farmer-crew from
the backwoods,” who won the inter-collegiate rowing
championship in ’75. Since then these Ithaca men have
only been defeated three times, their eight going under
once at Lake George, then to Philadelphia University at
Saratoga, and their four having been beaten on the
Thames. Cornell without doubt holds the eight and
four-oared amateur championships of America, although
Yale and Harvard think it politic to ignore them in their
annual contest.

The new English amateur walker, H. Curtis,
said to be the finest and fairest walker since the days of
Baby, and likely some day to do his eight miles inside the
hour, has beaten the Eiurlish amateur records at 5,6, and
7 miles at Aston, Birmingham.

__ The final match of the Australians with All
England, to have been played at Manchester, had to be
abandoned on account of rain. Our men have since de-
feated Staffordshire by an innings and 28 runs. The score
is now—Lost, 13 games ; won, 11; drawn, 8.

Psotta, the American amateur sculler, did a
manly thing in his heat for the Diamond Sculls at Henley.
The swivel of Kennedy’s right-hand scull opened and he
fell out of his boat, but Psotta, who had about £4OO on the
race, refused to row over the course, and waited until his
opponent was ready to start again. Kennedy beat him,
but the American received a document bearing tribute to
his manliness with the signatures of all the vowing digni-
taries, which, he said, made more than amends for the
beaten defeat.

Says London Entr’acte :
The Surrey professionals are, as a class, entirely superior
to the paid men who some years ago worked for the county
and the public-house at the same time. Men like Lohmann
and Maurice Read are better gentlemen than very many
of our present-day amateurs.

The N.Z. steeplechaser Sir Maurice, of whom
we spoke last week as once a member of Bland Holt’s
company, used to come on in the sale act of “New
Babylon.” He was named after Sir Maurice O’Rorke,
Speaker of the N.Z. Assembly, was owned by a cabman,
and valued, as a discarded racehorse, at £2O. Now that
he has forsaken the stage and rehabilitated his racing
reputation, his present owner, the boss of a hash-foundry,
wouldn’t take, it is said, £5OO for him.
The most awful picture we have ever seen
is in Paris L’lli.cstration, by last mail, repre-
senting an actual scene of only a month or two ago,
when the police broke into a wretched Parisian
attic, and found a whole family (eight persons)
dead; they had suffocated themselves with char-
coal fumes under pressure of starvation. It tran-
spired afterwards that they put it to the vote, and
were unanimous for death.
In a case of overcrowding in a village near
Bridgewater, England, it was given in evidence
that the defendant, an old labourer, with his wife,
two daughters, and eleven illegitimate children
belonging to the daughters, were herded in a hovel,
containing one room 14ft. by 9ft., and 6ft. 6in.
high, another 12ft. by 9ft., and a garret above,
reached by a ladder. There was no ceiling to one
of the rooms, and no casements to any of the win-
dows ; and the only water supply was from a
neighbouring ditch, into which the sewage of the
premises ran. Such is life in some of our country
villages, “where health and plenty cheer the
labouring swain.” —London Truth.
Sir Geo. Bowen writes that the captain of
the Kearsage told him that Capt. Semmes, of
the Alabama, could easily have been captured, as
he floated away on a spar; but the Kearsage’s
captain did not want to take Semmes to the
States, to be hanged. This leads a correspondent
of the London Spectator to publish the record
of a long conversation he had with Mr. Lancaster,
of the yacht Deerhound, which saved Semmes,
and 40 others. It was a little nine-year-old girl of
Mr. Lancaster’s who caused the Deerhound to go
out of Cherbourg. Lancaster had all his family
on board ; but Mrs. Lancaster, and the minority,
didn’t want to go because it was Sunday, and the
numbers were equal, till the little giiT plumped
for the fight. When they got there Mrs. Lan-
caster became so excited that she exclaimed, “Go
in a little closer!”

The successful forgery of a £SOOO-cheque
on a Melbourne bank recalls how neatly an astute
Maitland manager was ‘ ‘ had ” a few years ago.
A sleepy-looking bushman entered the bank with
a £9OO cheque. “ How will ye ’ave it?” “ Short!”
And short it was. Three days afterwards it was
discovered that the cheque had been altered from
nine to nine hundred. The quiet-looking bush-
man, who had meanwhile been painting the town
red, was arrested, and on him was found £6OO of
the money. He had been “lambed” to the tune
of £3OO.
Messrs. G. H. Smith and Son, of 302
George-street, the well-known hatters of this city,
have been made sole agents for Henry Heath, the
celebrated London hatter. The following is taken
from The Lady, an English fashion paper :
Mr. Henry Heath manufactures all his own silk felt hats,
together with those of many other hatters, and in addition
to inspecting his show-rooms, I made a tour through the
manufacturing and store department. The number of
hats in the latter department strikes any ordinary observer
with astonishment. The whole of the basement, in addi-
tion to several other large rooms, were all crowded with
shelves, filled with hats from floor to ceiling. The ship-
ping department is kept distinct from the rest of the
house, and, judging by the samples of the linings, Mr.
Heath’s foreign trade must be an enormous one.
The Victoria Market, Melbourne, is partly
built over the old cemetery. In sinking a post-
hole, lately, they found a skeleton in a red shirt,
with a rope round its neck; but whether suicided,
lynched, or hanged legally, nobody knew. Under
the market pavement-flags are about a thousand
bodies awaiting the Resurrection, while over them
goes on the chaffering over cabbages, turn-ups,
tomatoes, spring inyuns, butter, and strawberries.
The caretaker's ducks play over a lot of old flat
tombstones, inscribed in Hebrew, for everlasting
remembrance. This cemetery is rapidly becoming
a mere bare field, and in a few years there will be
scarce a remnant to show that there the rude fore-
fathers of the hamlet sleep.
COWBOY’S TOOTHACHE
Facing a Dentist Foolishly. How Suffering
Could Have Been Avoided.
Col. Metcalf, of Denver, Colo., U.S.A., was
once a cowboy, and tells a good story. ‘ ‘ Tin
winter of 1831,” he says, “ was a hard one, and I
never saw anything like the rain that spring.
When June came we were truly a drowned-out
set. I never was so worn out. I made up my
mind to go to Denver. I hit upon the toothache
for an excuse. My employer was at the home
ranch far away, as I thought; and so having
pressed my excuse on the boys I started. 1 got
to Denver in the morning. After breakfast I
lighted a cigar and stood on the steps of the hotel)
and standing there came face to face with my em-
ployer. I whipped out my handkerchief, and
whipped it up to my cheek, ‘Toothache—terrible,’
I muttered. ‘ Toothache, eh !’ ho said, looking at
me keenly, ‘come with me and have it out.’ I
hadn’t the courage to say a word, and followed
him meekly round to the office of the dentist. I
sat down in the chair in a state of utter collapse,
pointed out a back tooth, and groaned ‘Pull it.’
The dentist had hard work to get that tooth out,
for it was one of the best teeth a man ever had. I
had to pay two dollars for the operation too, and
when the tooth was out, and the dentist had
soothed my wounded jaw, my employer took me
down to the station and saw me off on the next
train for Kit Carson, bound for the camp. I
never dared to tell any of the boys how I got
beaten at ray game.”
To lose a good, sound. molar in that sort of
fashion was simply stupid cowardice. Any sort
of quick-witted man would have spoken of St.
Jacobs Oil, which everybody knows to be an
absolute cure for the toothache, and for all kinds
or any kind of ache or pain. How easy then, if
he must fib, to say that he had come to town to
get the great remedy, and he would have been
believed. Thousands testify to its efficacy, but
one or two instances will suffice to prove it. The
Hon. Billa Flint, Life Senator, Parliament,
Dominion of Canada, says: “It acted like a
charm in the cure of face neuralgia arising from a
defective tooth.” Mr. Edward Walters, 87
Bourke-street West, Melbourne, writes, “That
members of his family have used it most effectually
for toothache.” Mr. H. H. Hoermance, Lawrence-
burgh, Ind., U.S.A., August 17, 1888, states that
he suffered with toothache for two days. “1
tried,” he says, “ St. Jacobs Oil, and it cured me
immediately, and there has been no return of
pain.” A most remarkable cure was that of Mr.
Samuel B. Shiplor, Paragon, Ind., July 30, 1888.
“I suffered,’ he says, “with pain in my head
from sunstroke for twenty-two years, and was
cured by St. Jacobs Oil; no return of pain in four
years. ”
A PRACTICAL OPINION.
THE AGENT OF THE WATERBURY
WATCH COMPANY.
Sir, —As I have carried a Waterbury Watch for
several years, and it has proven a most reliable
timepiece, I trust it will not be out of place for
me to express my opinion concerning the well-
known watches. I am a teacher, and could not
satisfactorily use a watch which could not be de-
pended upon for correct time and durability. 1
have used at different times several other watches
of different manufacture ; but have frequently re-
turned them for the best of reasons—they would
not run. Finally, my father (A. O.
jeweller, of Chateaugay, N.Y.) obtained for me a
Waterbury, “series J” (short wind), saying he
knew from experience that would give satisfaction
in every way, and it has. The watch has not had
the best of care, I confess; yet it is, without ex-
ception, the best timepiece I have seen. I have
no desire to exchange it for any other. * * *
Very sincerely,
Metta E. Prescott,
Chernbusco, Clinton Co., N.Y.
April 29, 1880.
AT A TRIFLING COST
you can obtain a Waterbury watch, which rarely
gets out of order, and never constitutes itself a
permanent tax on the owner. In the event of
injury befalling it, by taking or sending it to the
Company’s Repair Depot, 50 Margaret-street, it
can be efficiently repaired at a nominal cost, rang-
ing, according to the extent of damage, from 6d.
to 2s. Cd., but never exceeding the latter amount
except by mutual consent. The genuine Water-
bury may be obtained from any respectable store-
keeper or dealer. Price, series “ E ” (the old
favourite) 13s. 6d.; series “J” or “L” (the new
marvels), enamelled dials, 22s. Gd. each.

Dear Sir,—l write to inform you that your-
“ Allcock’s Porous Plasters ” are excellent—a real
blessing. Whatever I may say, I feel 1 cannot
praise them sufficiently. I have given away
hundreds amongst the poor and suffering, and I
cannot recall a single instance where they failed
to give relief. They have been used by me for
complaints in the chest, liver, kidneys, and spine,
with marked results, in fact, I know of three
special oases out of many (one of chest, one of
liver, one of kidneys) where the sufferers had been
to the infirmary, tried many doctors, without any
benefit, and were told that nothing more could be
done. I gave them your plasters, and after a fair
trial of them the result was really wonderful.
The sufferer in the chest no longer complains of
weakness, has lost all distressing cough, and is
quite strong. The sufferer from liver complaint
no longer complains of indigestion and pains in
the side and between the shoulders, but is quite a
different person. The sufferer from kidney com-
plaint no longer lies in bed nine months in the
year in agonies, but is able to get out of doors
every day, and is free from pain. I shall recom-
mend these plasters wherever I go.—With all
good wishes for the New Year, yours very grate-

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888,
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq. .
Dear Sir,---This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took tt great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. _ At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever. KEENAN
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, m the

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
Th® Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literarj
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
TH® Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces—
Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress: it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege—the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the peari-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
Dther paper, because its vast mass of original and
apecially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

A writer in a West Australian newspaper
says:—“Whatever be the cause, it is a fact teat
in years gone by the officers of the Crown in this
colony secured a larger proportion of convictions
to trials than is obtained in these times.” T his
recalls a story of the early days of West Australia
which, taken in the ab uno disce omnes sense, will
tend to explain the cause of the large pro-
portion of convictions referred to. In one of
the country districts of the Swan River Settle-
ment, late in the fifties, the scales of justice
were held by an old thick-brogued gentleman,
with a keen eye to business. For performing the
duties of magistrate he received a fixed salary,
but he had an excellent private income from a
timber-mill, which he owned, as well. He used to
hold court once a fortnight. Sometimes a shep-
herd’s hut would serve as the Temple of J ustice;
at other times the majesty of the law would be
vindicated under the shade of a wattle-tree ; and
not unfrequently, in the winter time, could be seen
the impressive spectacle of the prisoners on one
side of a river, and the magistrate on the other,
passing sentence on them. The following is an
illustration of the dialogues which generally took
place between the Beak and the accused :—
Magistrate: “Robert Johnson, what are yeh
afther doin'? ” Johnson : “I ’ad only a drop too
much of tanglefoot, yer Wuship. I got it from
yer own men.” Magistrate: “Soilence in the
coort, Johnson, or OiTl put yeh where the
pigs won’t root in the dooer on yeh. Shu re
it’s meself that knows yeh, Johnson, and the likes
o’ yeh, yeh thavin’ villian ; ye’r too lazy to work,
and it’s meself that offered yeh tin shillin’s a
month and yer boord only a week ago, yeh good-
for-nothin’ scoundrel. Ye’r brought here by a
galoot of a peeler charged wid bein’ drunk, when
it’s thavin’ yeh ought to be charged wid ; for Oi
saw yeh wid me own two oise prowlin’ about shep-
herd’s huts for the last fortnit: and Oi now give
yeh six months’ hard labour on suspicion of com-
mittin’ a robbery. And go and do it at my timber-
mill, yeh limb o’ Satan.” No wonder the W. A.
officers of the Crown used to secure a larger pro-
portion of convictions than is now obtained.

Somebody told Sir William Robinson lately
a story about a N.S.W. Western celebrity who
took a couple of newspaper-men to see a splendid
monument he had erected to the memory of his
second wife, and the foundation-stone of which,
he calmly explained, had been laid by his third
and still living spouse. On hearing this tough but
true yarn, Sir William observed that “ the only
thing needed to finish-off that story was a five-
pound note and a letter of condolence from Lord
Carington. ”

846 Maoquarle-street North, Sydney, September 3, 1890.
My Dear Moorabinda,—
A lady at the recent Women’s Fund hall had rather an
unpleasant “ find ” in one of the galleries during the even-
ing. She was being led to dance, when her satin-shod foot
kicked against an obstacle which, when rescued, proved
to be an artificial shoulder-blade ! It was eventually
restored to the owner, who was dissolved in tears in the
dressing-room, hut who really courted the mishap. Why
a lady thus renovated should wear a Y-shaped corsage
and so give her anatomy the chance to escape isn’t
apparent. But it always would slip right off, since there
is nobody living brave enough to step up to a woman with
the remark, “ I beg your pardon, madam, but your
shoulder-blade is coming unpinned.” Now, is there ?
And, speaking of stepping up to people that is
generally what the incorrigible small brother calls “ a
mug’s game.” A woman told another woman at the
theatre one evening that her shoulder-strap was slipping,
and met with the angry response: “ And what is that to
you, pray?” The retorts lady No. 1 could have made but
didn’t almost tempt me to make one for her.
The benefit concert in aid of Sydney City Mission,
engineered by Miss Naylor, assisted by Miss Colborne
Baber, Kowalski, Lemmone, Allpress, Gehde, and other
musical lights, was held in Centenary Hall, on 29th ult.,
and was a distinct success. There was a large and well-
dressed house, and several handsfull of garden-produce
were hurled at the ladies. Colhorne-Baber (appearing
again in Sydney after a silence of a year) sang well in the
dainty “Bel Raggio,” and for encore gave “Way down
upon the Swan-ee-ee,” &c. —fortunately not in the
vernacular. Lemmone, of the dark and liquid eye, tootled
seraphioally, and Kowalski alone actively responded to the
second encore, accorded the duet “ Bohemienne,” played
with much brilliancy by Miss Naylor and the enthusiastic
Frenchman.
It would appear as if Bach’s music did not agree with
“the Biggest Organ in the World.” Recently the great
instrument gave a long, wheezing, hellowy sound, and
subsided in the middle of a Bach passage, and the other
afternoon, also during Bach, it became apparent that the
organ had a stitch in its vox hmnana, for presently, with
a windy snort, it “ struck” in the middle of the movement,
and sulked for an hour by Shrewsbury clock. All things
considered, a taste for organ-music isn’t easy of cultiva-
tion in Sydney, and it is rarely that Mayor Burdekin (who
must surely attend the Town Hall for the purpose) hasn’t to
advance and tell the crowd that our pet’s lungs have
gone wrong. Mr. Best doesn’t enjoy unfailing health,
and what with the capriciousness of the organ, and the
Sims-Reeves-like uncertainty of the talented musician,
the person who buys a ticket for an organ orgy must be
prepared for the worst.
Sydney crSohe or day-nursery, at 21 Maoquarie-street
South, was to be opened without any gubernatorial gush
on Ist inst. The reasons for the vice-regal withdrawal
are well understood. Whether because of its fall from
“ society ” grace or because the proposed fee really was
exorbitant, the creche has reduced its charge from 6d. to
4d. per diem.
Quite a posse of spectators, on rows of chairs placed in
the open air, assembled at Sydney Prince Alfred Hospital
on 27th ult. to assist at the laying of the foundation-stone
of the new Home for the nurses, by Lady Carington,
attended by Lord Carington, Lady Hamilton and Captain
Trench. But the chief item of the programme was the
unveiling of a bust (by Sir John Steele) of that nurse of
nurses, Miss Nightingale, which Lady Carington scientifi-
cally denuded of its bagging after a few biographical re-
marks from Sir Alfred Roberts. A procession of nurses in
grey and lilac gowns, each placing a posie of tributory
violets at the base of the bust was sentimental and pretty,
and the warbling of “Home! Sweet Home” by St-
Cecilia’s Choir would have given an almost tearful turn to
the proceedings if it had not appeared that the choristers
had left their breaths in their luncheon-baskets. For the
arduous task of gazing fixedly at the foundation-stone
while a son of toil heaved it into place, Lady Carington
(who carried a charming committee-bouquet) was pre-
sented with a handsome paper-knife and paper-weight in
the form of a silver mallet and trowel, the handle of the
former being the figure of a nurse in solid silver.
At the laying of the Sydney Nurses’ Home foundation,
stone. Governor Carington amiably remarked that “ The
young gentlemen of the colonies would not allow the
nurses to grow old in their avocations, but took them
away.” It is currently reported that another foundation-
stone will have to be ordered, owing to the number of
ladies now desirous of enrolling as hospital nurses.
It is Sir Alfred Roberts’ opinion that “ there are nurses
in N.S.W. equal to any in Europe, and that many amongst
them would meet any emergency with efficiency.” There
is one emergency to which all the ministering angels,
without exception, are equal. That is when the bachelor
medico with the waxed moustache squeezes her hand
across the operating table, or surreptitiously hugs her in
t he dead-house.
A novel feature at the second series of orchestral con-
certs, commenced at the Centennial Hall on 30th nit.,
was that the daughters of one of the secretaries acted as
usheresses and were indefatigable in showing people
where they belonged, both upstairs and downstairs,
thereby making things very easy for that portion of the
audience which had booked its resting-place beforehand.
There was a large attendance; headed by Mayor and
Mrs. Burdekin, in a sage-green gown, the toque hat
relieved with touches of red, but there was no dress,
ing worth comment—the same absence of style which
characterised the Otton series being very noticeable.
One gets so accustomed to sidling through a dense mass
of humanity at Sydney Royal, during comic opera seasons-
that repeating the experiment, on 30th ult., at the
redivivus of “ Boccaccio ” didn’t excite yours ever to even
the smallest extent. There were lots of society people
dotted about the house, though owing to the Mayoress’s
post-organ recital supper-party, a few “regulars” were
missing. Wigs and legs are vanity; but quail-on-toast is
an enduring thing.
Sydney Bicycle Club sports at the Association Ground
on 30th ult. were well patronised everywhere but in the
ladies’ reserve. The concourse there mostly consisted of
the suburban girl in her Sunday frock, and among the
garments one looked twice at were a heliotrope cashmere
mingled with a mauve chow-oheok and pansy toque, a
cream delaine figured in mauve, hat in violets, mignonette
and wax roses, a flecked putty-coloured tweed topped by
t four-little-hlackbirds-haked-in-a-pie sort of hat; and a
dawn-grey combined in a Brown-Potterish manner with
black velvet, black felt hat and feathers. The races were
of absorbing interest, and the movements of a man in a
tall, black, glossy hat, who rode recklessly about on top
of a spidery hike, were breathlessly followed.
Wail of a lonely soul per a Sydney newspaper :
I\/rATRIMONIAL. —Lady, 40, first-class Villa,
LVL grounds, all appointments requisite, freehold,
income £3OO, desires introduction gent., good social
position, income not less £5OO year; references ex-
changed. Genuine, P. 0., Park-st.
“All appointments requisite ” is a neat way of alluding to
the chairs and tables and things without which matrimony
is a hollow snare, and connuhiality a vain thing. Which
reminds me that, despite its air of comfort, not to say
luxury, this advt. has appeared three times, while the
two-line remark of a young lady who wanted to “ view
matrimony ” at the age of 23 appears hut a fitful onoe>
having apparently evoked an offer. ’Twas ever thus.
The woman of 40, with “all requisite appointments,’
hasn’t a chance beside a blue-eyed juvenile with one frock
to her hack.
The Women’s Fund ball, on 26th ult.—the first festivity
of the kind held in the completed Centennial Hall-
attracted a large and varied assemblage; over one
thousand people were present, and every society person
who could attend was there. Lord and Lady Carington,
who brought with them Lady Hamilton and Miss Walenn,
stayed to a late hour and took much interest in the ball,
for the success of which Lady Carington had worked like
a Trojan, as president of the fund benefited. Music,
supper, and floor (it was rather humpy-up, owing to the
prevalence of midshipmen, %ho apparently regard their
partners as marlin-spikes) were good, and a programme
of twenty dances was formally opened by a quadrille in
which Lord Carington danced with Lady Hamilton and
Lady Carington’s partner was Sir Frederick Darley.
The dressing was remarkably good. Lady Carington
was fairy-like in a herthe bodice of white satin striped
brocade, with skirt of white gauze striped with silver, a
garland of blush roses coming from the left shoulder
on to the skirt and ending in a plaque of roses
on the right side, with white aigrette on the
left shoulder, necklace, bracelets, and tiara of dia-
monds, white shoes and Suede gloves, the bouquet
“presented,” &c., &c., of pink cream and white with
ferns and streamers. Lady Hamilton was rather plainly
attired in a trained gown of crushed strawberry and
ivory brocaded silk over a jupe and bodice-front of white
chiffon, and wore no jewels at all, while the dressing of
the vice-regal looks suggested a strike on the part of the
vice-regal maid ; Miss Walenn wore pale-grey brocade and
Valenciennes lace ; Mdlle. Roderiguez appeared in yellow,
and Mrs. Burdekin in pale grey-blue and sunset-pink
silk with wide stripes florally designed, draperies of
pleated sunset-pink crepe, diamond necklace ; the Misses
Cox wore black with silk-headed bodices and skirts o*
black Russian net relieved in the one instance with
yellow and in the other with cardinal, hair d la chignon ;
Miss Nellie Hill, eau-de-nil and salmon pink crepe and
silk ; Lilian Seccombe, black lace and silk relieved with
yellow roses ; Marian Burton, white satin and clusters of
pink roses, the plain skirt front designed in gold and
pink tinsel thread ; Frances Saville, white corded silk and
chiffon ; Miss Burdett-Smith, pale-blue tulle with diamond
star and necklet—and so on ad infinitum ,*Homo of the
floral dresses coming out splendidly indeed. A white tulle
with the water-fall pelted with white daisies was
deliciously fresh and pretty, and Miss Halliday’s pale-pink
crepe, front studded with tiny pink and green flowerets,
was a most admirable costume.
The wisdom of economy in connection with charity balls
is too obvious for comment, and if gingerbeer and buna
were the refreshments provided, I’m sure nobody would
audibly cavil. But a bad light in the dressing-room is a
thing no woman, however charitably disposed, can for-
give, and the lighting in the “repairing-room” at the
Women’s Fund ball made many a butterfly regret that she
didn’t carry matches. A twilight dressing-room is really
a very treacherous institution. The effect of the shadowy
looking-glass was cruelly apparent in the glare of tlu
ball-room, one lady having wiped the rose-de-beauth off of
one cheek while the other resembled a “ mulberry
sprinkled with meal,” and a long, disconsolate-looking
lock of false tress bristling with hairpins which lay perdu
on the floor of the ball-room (and which, oddly enough,
nobody ever claimed) doubtless owed its easy detachment
to the subdued half-light.
And another mistake in connection with the ladies’-
room at the Fund ball was that it was yards up a corridor
down which a stream of peeled people in all their glory
met an incoming tide of spectres arriving in ulsters and
clouds and every other abomination that women bundle-
up in after sunset. Wrapping-up suits a woman in pro-
portion to the glories of her outer-covering, but to he met
in an ulster of last year’s check, with her gown pinned
up round her knees, making her five feet in diameter, and
carrying her floral adornments in a paper-bag, doesn’t
put a woman in a good temper with herself exactly
Then the arrangement was that ladies met their escorts
“ in the ball-room,” and as the ordinary she doesn’t fancy
beating her way through a festive crowd without the
moral support of a dress-suit in her vicinity, lots of
muddle resulted—men waiting patiently in the ball-room
and decolette females with anguish on their brows
dodging flatteringly about the corridors.
What rational parents mean by allowing young girls to
cavort at Bands of Hope and things of the sort, standing
on platforms before crowded houses, and screeching,
thumping and declaiming with the aplomb of profes-
sionals, is a mystery. A local mamma, addicted to making
a public character of her daughter, with a view to induc-
ing hopeless drunkards to take the pledge for the
seventeenth time, or else buy socks for the heathen or
something, was brought up with a short, sharp shock
recently. There was a sacred spree of some sort on in the
tabernacle, at which Jane was going to sing, and as
mamma came softly in to superintend the toilet, Jane
observed laying on the carmine like a coryphee. The
true explanation, “I really want it, stuck up on the plat-
form, ma,” didn’t suffice, and now the Hope of the
Heathen has to bury her talents at afternoon Sunday-
schools.

All preliminaries for establishing the Sydney Gover-
ness’ Home are now arranged. The fee for board and
lodging at the Home will be from 18s to £1 per week—
double-rooms, 14s each occupant—which includes free
registration and, in fact, everything hut washing.
Associates may join the Home for 5s per annum, for which
low figure they may treat it as a club where they may
write letters, rest, wait, &e., &c. There will be a matron
at £3O per annum, a housekeeper and a charwoman, and
with a very strong committee and the prevailing
Governor’s wife as president, the “Institoot” will have
quite a “ society ” interest. Subscriptions are only
required to set the ball a-rolling in the matter of furni-
ture, and the Home will not he ventured upon ere the
committee have a year’s rent in hand.
Sydney “Women’s Literary Society” is, in sporting

They don’t think much of Cavmencita at the American
watering-place, Narragansett. Says the local critic: —
“ Carmencita is in no sense a surprise or a stimulant to
the inhabitant of this locality, whose regular life is filled
with visions of woman in her choicest guise, and whose
senses are never free from the champagne of her most
passionate moods. While the New Yorker, who has never
visited this neighbourhood, is vulnerable to the soft fleshy
snap of Carmencita’s slender body, the wise habitues of
this salt-blown paradise can be fanned into ardour only by
such magnificent artistry of the feminine shape as our
own ladies reveal so fairly. The Spanish dancer’s red and
rather insinuating mouth, her drowsy, languishing eyes,
her rollicking swing of arms and hips were at first re-
CARMENCITA
(The World-famous Danseuse).
garded with much favour, hut considerable adverse
criticism was heard concerning the length of the
dancer’s yellow satin dress, which reached quite to
the top of her slippers. This concealment of her limbs
was a grave mistake on the part of Carmencita. We are
a colony with strictly original ideas about beauty and its
uses, and when a lady is too prudish to warm the gaze of
man upon her knee-pan she is too good for our section of
the world ; however, as she began to move on the wings
of the music she lifted her feet, allowing the really valu-
able part of her to come curving out of the cloud of lace — •
and then the audience became calmer. But with all the
swift glimpses of this reasonably graoeful section of her-
self, and with her entire series of cerebral twists, Carmen-
cita did not approach, in point of maddening freedom of
body, any of our regular prize beauties, who have only to
tumble over a wave of medium size to show the perfect
plan of all that is feminine. By the side of them this
Spanish woman is no better than an iron hydrant. Vale,
Carmencita! Come again, when you have not so much
on ! ”
Playing Othello once, Barry Sullivan, while vainly
clamouring for the handkerchief made sacred by Des-

Wybert Reeve, now resident manager of Adelaide

Wybert can tell some interesting stories of the old days.
His great subject is Irving, to whom Wybert appears to

A Swede, in Paris, emulated the flea-trainers with a lot-
of rats, which went through a hanging ceremony and
burial service, hut one day all was broken up through a
spectator throwing them a piece of bun. Hunger was the
only incentive. It reminds one of Parliament.
The original production, in Melbourne, of “Hero and
Leander,” suggests a review of the pieces which have first
seen the light in Australia. The works of Akhurst,
Marcus Clarke, Cooper, Darrell, Walch, and Whitworth
will be chiefly recalled. Bellew doesn’t disclose whether
“ Hero and Leander” is English, American, or Australian.
Perhaps the most creditable original play brought out in
Australia was “The Gladiator,” an ambitious classic
affair, by Jaffray, a Melbourne journalist of yore.
Toole’s theatre is the smallest in London ; it holds only
£l6O.
A Melbourne amateur planned a great hit with his
miser, hugging his “ G-o-old, ha, ha !” tied-up in a hand-
kerchief ; but it burst, and the broken china was scattered
all over the stage. Well, there was a real life moral in
that also.
Arthur Lloyd, eomique, being interviewed lately, said
Lord Carington first introduced the Prince of Wales to

The great American actress, Ada Rehan, has electrified
London audiences as Rosalind in “As You Like It,” now
being played by the Daly Company, at the Lyceum. One
critic says; “She is the great Rosalind of our time, and I

famous Rosalinds, from Peg Woffington to Mrs. Jordan,
and from Mrs. Jordan downwards.”
Lilian Tree, who is a pupil of Sir Charles Hall 6, intends

Another member of the lately-dissolved Braoy company
—little Flora Graupner—has been attacked by diphtheria
in Melbourne. Is there anything in the vocally exercised
throat that renders it peculiarly susceptible to this
insidious disease, or do the theatre dressing-rooms of mal-

Johnny Solomon Is now in business as an auctioneer in
George-street, Sydney. Selling, the other day, after

Marian Burton leaves for colder climes, we hear, on the
expiration of her six months’ term with the Nellie Stewart
company.
Emma Chambers is still running a company in South
Africa. So is Emelie Melville, assisted by Verdi.
Toole has enjoyed a pleasant Bendigo experience, very
different to that of his old friend, Charles Matthews, there.
Matthews raised prices, wherefore the curtain was rung up
to half-a-dozen people in the house, and the gay' Charles
refused to shake a leg. The worst sell known in that line
was Arthur Sketohley’s (Mrs. Brown) at the Melbourne
Athenaeum, when he came up, with much side on, to
lecture, but hardly a soul attended. Poor Arthur de-
parted with his plumes sadly draggled.

A little pleasant variety has been supplied to *\e popu-
lation of Kimberley (South Africa) by the circumstance
, that a travelling menagerie has broken loose, and the
town has been rushed by four lions, two lionesses, two
tigers, three bears, two wolves, one hyena, two cheetahs,
four jackasses, one elephant, three camels, and sixteen
baboons. Most of the inhabitants are camped on roofs,
or on the tops of clothes-props and telegraph-poles, and
. generally a refreshing oasis has appeared in the great
desert of everyday life. The residents are gradually getting
used to the new arrangements.
Boucioault is said to have taken the incidents for

Recent revelations make it evident that the professional

One of the finest collection of acting plays in Australia,
perhaps the finest, is owned by a journalist who, in his
own person, unites Church and Stage by dragging out a
miserable existence on the staff of a religious paper, while
solacing his soul by collecting and hoarding dramas. He
purchased the bulk of Harwood’s stock from Cole, and
has on his shelves Dick’s, Lacy’s, Duncomhe’s, French’s,
and Oxherry’s publications, besides copies of many
modern plays.
Miln leaves Melbourne tor London in a few weeks, with
the good wishes of all. His Richard 111. will give more

THE DOLL HOUSE-WIFE.
Among his books he sits all day
To think and read and write ;
He does not smell the new-mown hay
The roses red and white.
I walk among them all alone,
His silly, stupid wife ;
The world seems tasteless, dead and done
An empty thing is life.
At night his window casts a square
Of light upon the lawn ;
I sometimes walk and watch it there
Until the chill of dawn.
I have no brain to understand
The books he loves to read ;
I only have a heart and hand
He docs not seem to need.
He calls me “Child”—lays on my hair
Thin fingers, cold and mild ;
Oh ! God of Cove, who answers prayer,
I wish I were a child !
And no one sees and no one knows
(He least would know or see)
That ere love gathers next year’s rose
Heath will have gathered me.
And on my grave will bindweed pink
And round-faced daisies grow ;
He still will read and write and think.
And never, never know !

Froude, the historian, was within an ace

took alarm.

Now that Cardinal Newman is dead we

When Labouchere first stood for North-
Hampton his Radical reputation was sufficient to
semre him the support of the embryo Republi-
pans, who are pretty numerous in that city of St.
Crispin; but to place him in the desired position
at the poll it was essential to obtain as well the
“ vote and interest ” of the Dissenting fraternity,
How to arrange this was, in the face of his widely-
known atheistical tendencies, rather a poser,
Temporising with them proved of no avail, and he
was at last forced to consent to meet a deputation
of Chadbands, upon satisfying whom depended
his fate. A public meeting had been called for
eight o’clock on a certain evening, and it was ar-
™nged that he should receive the deputation man
adjoining room half an hour earlier. The evening
arrived and with it the gentlemen m black. Labby
had never been in such “ good’’company, or at
he decently could, but however profuse his
cordiality it could hardly be made to extend over
the whole of the two mauvaises quarts dheure.
Let Labby himself take up the running: An
idea struck me. I surveyed my would-be tor-
mentors, and selecting the one whom I took
to be the best stayer, said : ‘Gentlemen
this being an occasion fraught with the most
momentous issues, I think we cannot do better
Rian commence with prayer, and I call upon
Brother to offer up a petition.’ This met
with unanimous approval, and I saw made an im-
pressiom We all knelt and my Ohadband pro-
oeeded in a, to me, delightfully slow and measured
®tmm, I, throughout, emitting the appropriate
groans, in which I had to take my cue from my
companions my whole attention being centred on
the clock. Ten, fifteen, twenty minutes went, oh,
so slowly! but still he held on; another ten
minutes and I should be safe. The crowd m the
adjacent hall we could hear was getting more noisy
and impatient every minute. (I had taken care
teat they should be admitted very early). But,
alas, when it still wanted five minutes to the hour
my man failed me and arose, and with him the
rest. Having come so near victory it would have
been hard indeed if it had then eluded me. I
played my trump-card. I remained on my knees
wrestling in private prayer! When eight o’clock
struck I rose and made for the hall, followed by
the now thoroughly satisfied black-coated gentry,
whose presence on the platform carried the meet-
ing with me and gained me the seat.”
TJ® " ow , f amous . y°«?g. Franco-Russian
arfcl f and autobiographer, Mane Bashkirtseff, we
read > Y as remarkably shrewd in spots, and had
fnewise notion, which is strongly recommended
to the young women whose tears are watering the
land because they cannot get some ring or some
bangle. She never wore jewellery! She said that
diamonds and such thmgs were made for old
people; the young girl who wore a diamond was a
fool. N°thing about a young girl should be so
bri S ht and sparkling as that young girl s eye. Iso
y°«ng girl s eye of course, could hope to compete
Wl . fc l tke s P arkle °J a diamond. Therefore, she
Baid > sbe was no .t such an idiot as to put a
d ' amond where it could putsparkle her eye.
Her own words on the subject were: “That
the point lumineux (luminous point) about a
§ irl should be the pupil of her eye
Diamonds and such things were good for old
f(dks who wanted some sparkle about them, and
whose eyes could no longer supply it.” She
had a P™ 1 - °Pm'on of Worth, the dressmaker
as an artis -at east, so far as the making of
young girls clothes w 7 as concerned. She used to
say that he could make things fit only for broidery
down the back. She never wore bonnets, of
course; for unmarried women under thirty in
Paris never wear them. The bonnet is as much a
sign of marriage in France as having your two
middle upper front teeth knocked out is among
certain savage tribes. Toward the end, Marie
began to regret that she had not married; not
that she thought that she was dying, but because
with her fading beauty, admiration was less plen-
tiful. For some reason she got it into her head
that young men did not come trooping for her
hand because they did not believe her wealthy.
She ought to have taken the high ground of
scorning to attract anybody by her dowry.
But she did not, because, as a matter of fact,
the other thing is all right in France.
She said one day to her Aunt Romanoff : “ They
think that vve haven’t really got money, because
our property is away off in Russia and not right
here in France; but I will show them. ” And,
unbelievable as it may seem, she packed her Aunt
Romanoff off to her lawyers with instructions that
she faithfully carried out. She sold for cash a part
of her estate in Poltava and brought the money
back to the bouse in numerous bags of gold. Marie
lay enthroned in state in bed, and the gold was
poured out around her in a yellow stream, out-
lining her form on the white counterpane. She
played with it for awhile with her fingers, then
thin and weak, for it was only a short time before
she died, and her whim being satisfied, Aunt
Romanoff picked it up and probably carted it off
to the bank. Perhaps Marie was pleased at the
thought that she was like Danas, whom
she must have seen illustrated in the Salon,
visited by Jupiter in a golden shower. The
Duke of Hamilton, alluded to with such fre-
quency, pathos, and silliness by Marie in her love-
sick early days, is still alive, and is thus de-
scribed :~He is fat and yellow, with a red face,
but withal a very good type of an English duke.
His name alone is quite an imposing affair, and
no doubt Marie knew it by heart and repeated it
over and over with great satisfaction. Here it is ;
—Duke of Hamilton, Sir William-Alexander-
Louis-Stephen-Douglas-Hamilton, K. T., Mar-
quess of Douglas and Clydesdale, Earl of Angus,
Arran, Lanark, and Selkirk, Lord Hamilton,
Avon, Polmont, Maehanshire, Innerdale, Aber-
nethy, Jedburgh Forest, Dare, and Shortcleugh,
Duke of Brandon and Baron of Dutton, Premier
Peer of Scotland. He also claims to be Duke of
Ohatelherault under an imperial decree of Napo-
leon 111. The young woman who did marry this
very desirable duke, and whom Marie so violently
hated in consequence, without having any idea of
whom she was, was Lady Marie Montagu, the
oldest daughter of the Duke of Manchester,
and the sister of the former disreputable
Lord Mandeville, now duke. The paid
of a much-worshipped young man, which
he was made to play in Mane’s journal, has
caused the yellow Duke of Hamilton a great deal
of annoyance and unlimited chaffing. Marie, it
is true, speaks of him only as the Duke of H ,
but this is no protection for poor Hamilton, as he
is the only duke in the English peerage whose
name begins with an H. His friends are very
fond of chaffing him, and particularly of quoting
that passionate exclamation of the little Russian
at the age of 12 : “ Oh, my God ! give to me the
Duke of H . I will make him happy !’’ It is
possible, also, that the Lady Marie M ontagu may
have had some observations to make to his grace
about Marie’s journal. It will be remembered
that this ingenuous young Russian speaks very
frankly and jealously of the Duke of H ’s
mistress, and of the latter’s habit of eating cakes
publicly in the windows of that immoral lady’s
house. The fact that the Duke of Hamilton, as
he has frequently and tearfully put it, “ never saw
the little brat,” meaning our dignified friend Marie,
and therefore, of course, never knew what a
beautiful being he had stirred to admiration,
makes it all the harder for him to stand so much
chaffing now.

Tales of “The System.”
No. VIII.: Miss Latchford’s Overseer.
[OR THE BULLETIN.]
Sergeant Derby stood, in the sunlight of a
November afternoon, at the garden-gate of the
Turnut Police-station. He was watching a tired,
drooping figure, clothed in a shabby black-cloth
Suit, coming up the dusty Jugiong-road.
“ Labour on pass,” he said to himself.
The figure drew nearer and nearer till it stopped
before him ; and proved the accuracy of his con-
jecture by saluting, and then holding out to him a
bit of paper, partly printed and partly scrawled
over with many “fists” in various stages of
legibility.
“ Sydney? ” ejaculated the Sergeant as ho took
the “pass” and examined it. The convict (a
young man of 23) replied that he had come from
the city.
“Ah, you’ll be pretty well knocked up after
that. Here, sit down on that verandah-seat while I
check your pass.”
The pass-holder hesitated.
“Aren’t you tired?” said Derby. “Well, if
you are not, you must be a well-plucked ’un after
that tramp—and (glancing again at the pass) just
off a four-months’ voyage, too !”
“Yes, sir, I am tired, ” the convict replied, “but
the Regulation”
“What Regulation?” sharply interrupted the
officer.
“No. 18, sir”—and the convict repeated the
sub-section “ordering all prisoners to stand when
under interrogation.” He recited it mechanically
as though it were burnt into his brain. As,
indeed, and not to mince matters, it was. The
System took plenty of care that its subjects should
have their memories exercised, however it might
treat their stomachs and their souls. It gave them
the Regulations with their morning meal of brown-
bread, and the noonday soup, and the evening
hominy. Sometimes, in order to spiritualise the
souls by afflicting the stomachs, the System
stopped the meals, or reduced their quantity.
But, never by any chance, did it omit the Regula-
tions. If a prisoner had nothing to digest, he had
always the Regulations; and on Sundays a double
dose with the clean shirts.
»“ Bother the Regulations !” quoth the Sergeant.
“Here, I order you to sit down while I get you
something to eat. Got grub with jrou, I s’pose ?”
He turned over the pass and, looking at the last
of the endorsements, resumed: “You were last
rationed, I see, at the Pigeon Hole—and I know
what that means—a quarter short and sour bread.
Wonder what the Government means allowing
poor devils to be robbed !”
From these observations the acute reader will
infer that the Sergeant was not the most ardent
admirer of the System, and the acute reader will
not be far wrong. You see the Sergeant had been
trained in the school of Captain Charles Sturt;
and though his teacher s conduct in the Sudds and
Thompson’s episode is apparently indefensible
(according to our modern notions), yet Sturt was,
as a rule, as humane in his treatment of “Gov.-
men ” as he was with respect to the aborigines.
Here and there, the System developed the noblest
qualities in its administrators ; but the Franklins,
the Wilsons, the Maconochies, the Sturts, the
Naylors and theCri uohes —the men who interposed
an elevated humanity between the System and its
victims—are to be reckoned by units only, and not
tens. Because they were so few, the greater share
of honour theirs, and the larger portion of shame
others’. In the day that Australia counts her
heroes she will do these few men justice.
It was because Derby was one of Sturt’s men
that he treated John Denham, newly-arrived
transport per Ocean, No. 38,328, with an unob-
trusive kindliness that damped Denham’s burning
eyeballs with a tender dew that had been foreign
to them since the hour when his mother—and
another woman—bade him farewell in the corridor
of Gdtspur-street, Compter.
Denham was “labour on pass ” to the employer
to whom j 1 ® had been assigned. In twenty-mile
stages from Sydney, reporting himself at every
police-station he had passed, and getting a ration
of bread (as often as not short-weighted) at each
place, he had tramped his way under a November
sun to Tumut—the nearest station to his destina-
tion. Fifteen “ reports ’’had he made en route; as
many times had his pass been examined, the des-
cription therein compared with his person, and
endorsed with the particulars demanded by the
Regulation in that case made and provided. These
were ; The authorisation to proceed, the number
and class of rations issued, the date of inspection,
the sobriety or non-sobriety of the holder, and the
signature of the inspecting officer. Fifteen times
had this form been gone through, and on no occa-
sion had the inspecting officer had aught but a
stern or harsh word for the pass-holder. He had
been given his ration, sometimes with a curse by
way of a sweetener to the soured or mouldy loaf,
and sometimes with a look that lacerated his feel-
ings more than the curse. The Establishment did
not pay for kind words or pleasant smiles; rather,
on the contrary, was it inclined to reward their
opposites. Not at all astonishing was it, therefore,
that, when Sergeant Derby, a quarter-of-an-honr
later, called Denham into his neat office and bade
him, with a rugged sympathy in his voice, sit
down to the meal that lay spread on a snowy nap-
kin on a table in the corner, not at all surprising
was it, we say, that “No. thirty-eight, three, two,
eight ” gave one glance at the food, another at the
Sergeant (who “ made-believe ’’not to see it), and
then placed his arm against the door-post, bent his
head on it —and wept like a child.
“ Tut, tut, man !” exclaimed the Sergeant. “ Be
a man !” He got up from his desk and pulled-to
the door that led from the office to the sitting-
room of his quarters. He had caught the sound
of a sob from behind the door, and guessed that
his little wife was glancing through the interstice
at No. 38,328, and was weeping out of the pity of
her heart for the poor chap, who was affected into
tears by a little kindness. At least, that is the
reason that he gave his spouse when at tea-time
she asked why he had shut the door. As she
boxed his ears she told him he was fibbing, that he
closed it because he did not wish the pass-holder
to see that he was within a barleycorn’s length of
crying as well. From which faint glimpse of
domesticity the acute reader will please draw
another inference to the effect that Mrs, Derby
did not admire the System any more than did her
husband. We shall see, one time or another, a
good deal of little Mrs. Derby, and we shall only
bid her farewell at the side of the grave in which
she has just laid her dear, dead Sergeant, slaugh-
tered by Bushraneer Tallboy. But that hour is
not yet.
#
We should bo fibbing like the Sergeant
if we said that Convict Denham made a hearty
meal. He didn’t; he just crumbled a morsel of
the sweet, white loaf and touched it with an atom
of the golden butter, and, trying to wash it down
with a drink of the new milk, failed miserably;
but he felt as refreshed as though it were a
draught of strong wine that coursed through his
veins, and not merely a dron of the elixir of a
brother-man’s sympathy. And while he pre-
tended to enjoy the evidences of Mrs. D.’s house-
wifery, the Sergeant—gazing all the time out of
the doorway and not at No. 38,328—discoursed to
him mildly :
“Look here, Denham,” he said, “I’m going to
give you a word of advice. I think you’ll take it
properly, otherwise I wouldn’t offer it, but I see
you are—well, not far gone in crime. Yet,
and .”
Denham broke in, with emotion, stiffing his
utterance :
“No, indeed, sir, I broke the law once —and
I’ve been punished for it, and I won’t go any
deeper—if I can help it.”
“ Ah, that's it—if you can help it. But this
damned System won’t let many a man help it. It
throws the youngsters hi sin into the company of
the oldsters. And that’s what I want particularly
to say to you. Keep yourself to yourself, the old
hands will make your life a burden to yon at first
if you do. They will try and trap you, and then
put you away, but never mind that. Don’t put
on any airs with them, but keep them at a dis-
tance. Do that and keep out of mischief, and
while I'm here I’ll stand your friend. That’s be-
tween you and me, you see. Don’t say that to
others. But lam Assistant Muster-Master of this
district, and one way and another have got a deal
of power. As for Miss Latchford (that’s your
Mistress, you know) you’ll find her difficult to get
on with at first. She is terribly proud—why,
you’ll find out from herself, perhaps—but she lias
a rare head for management, and, on the whole, a
just head. Her chief fault is that she has no
heart - .
The Sergeant stopped here—and glanced around.
Something like a muttered remonstrance came
from behind the parlour door. If the tiny wife
and the big man had any subject of chronic
marital and fference, it was this question of Miss
Latch ford’s heartlessntjss.
The Sergeant went on—-
“At least, I say so, but my wife says she has.
Anyhow, she has a just and'a strong head, and
I’m sure that when she s e you are different from
other Gov’ment men about here, she will make
your lot easier than it would be with others.”.
There was no doubt about it this time. Both
the Sergeant and No. 38,328 heard it distinctly !
The voice behind the door exclaimed, in a tone
that was meant to be very, very ironical, “And
yet he says she ha no heart !”
The Sergeant laughed, and continued—
“ She, M'ss Latchford, I mean, has told me to
look oat for you, and what she wants you to do if
you are competent. You will be storekeeper and
bookkeeper. I expect she’ll let you have quarters in
the store-room, if you are steady and don’t give
trouble—but I don’t think you will. Do your
duty and both she and I will help you, I am sure
to get your ‘ticket’ when it’s due, am) it’s only
a matter of time then for yon to make money for
yourself. I shall see you at monthly musters, and
perhaps, once or twice in the month besides, and
you can let me know how you are getting on. Of
course, I’ll hear of you too, from Miss Latchford—
she don’t go much among he squatters, and my
wife and I are pretty well the only fr ends she has,
for all her money—and talk of the devil, here she
is!”
As he concluded, the Sergeant moved forward
to open the gate. Denham followed, and as the
officer returned, escorting a lady who held up j le ,(
serge riding-skirt with a hand that, though i arr , 1
and guileless of gloves, was shapely, took off
cap, and stood at attention —as per Regulation
# # #
Miss Latch ford, of Hereford Station— tlm
young woman who looked him up and down with
a steady gaze—was in the first bloom of a brilliant
and beautiful womanhood. Her beauty was of
that type that might coarsen with advancing
years, but would not wither. The tinge of vivid
colour implanted by _ a brisk gallop harmonised
effectively enough with the slight bronze which
was her cheeks’ natural hue, and to which the
southern sun, and the mountain breezes had been
so lenient as not to deepen, notwithstanding
that their owner spent most of her time out n't;
doors. An exquisitely-shaped upper-lip, and an
under-one that expressed decision no less em-
phatically than beauty, when they parted their
carminecl curves displayed regular teeth ( ,f
ivory pallor; her nose was, perhaps, a trifle
too large, but the delicate roundings of the
nostrils supplied a compensation; and superb
eyes, with iris of a true purple, looked out reso-
lutely—too resolutely, indeed—from between
long lashes and from beneath a forehead almost
masculine in its sweeping height and breadth of
outline. Blue-black hair was coiled massively
under the hat of dark-felt; and a foot peepcd-out
from under the looped skirt that no one—not even
a fashionable bootmaker —would have termed
small, but to which no one would deny the attri-
bute of a fine instep. Tall, with a iitheness of
movement, that gave an additional grace to bodily
lines which fell little short of an ideal perfection
and with a stately poise of the head which
betokened a strong, self-centred individuality that
had, notwithstanding, nothing in common with
selfish or vain dispositions. Such was Kate
Latchford. Where she got her good looks no one
could guess, though the topic was a constant
theme of district speculation. Her father had
had no characteristics of manly beauty; } le ,.
mother none of feminine. Perhaps in Kate some
century-gone strain of physical excellence revived
under the stimulating conditions of a glorious
climate, ample leisure, and ampler wealth.
Whether that was so or no, Denham, as he looked
at her, and whenever he looked at her afterwards,
compared her with the high-bred women whom
he had seen crossing West-End pavements and
sauntering in the Park. Something also ho
thought now of the haughty gaze of the aristo-
cratic dames and damsels was visible in those
stern yet beautiful eyes, which examined him
much as they might do a yearling colt. He
thought, too, that the Sergeant must be
right. She must lack heart. There was a
hardness in her glance that seemed to indicate a
character unsusceptible to the finer emotions.
Nature had keyed her, perhaps, to intense chords
from which a mighty pa-sion might smite a
thunderous and sombre music, but the subtler
filaments that breathe a note of sweetness when
touched by the velvety fingers of homely and
friendly affection—these, assuredly, were missing.
She addressed the convict in a dry, business-like
tone.
“You are John Denham, assigned to mo—Miss
Latchford, of Hereford Station?”
“Yes, madam,” replied No. 38,328.

at Sydney, selected you at Carter’s Barracks, be*
cause you said you were a clerk. That is so? ”
“That is so, madam.”
“ You are competent to keep station-books, give
out st res, and so forth ?”
“ I think so.”
“You must be sure before I put you on. If I
put you to the work, and you can’t do it, I shall
bring you before the magistrates for punishment.
I speak plainly. The last man they sent me as a
clerk was a swell mobsman, lagged for twisting a
sparkler.* I gave him two-dozenf and sent him
back. If you can’t do the work, say so. You had
better go back at once without punishment, than
return with your back tickled.”
Upon Denham’s spirits, which had felt more
buoyant after the Sergeant’s speech than they had
ever done since the Law touched him on his
shoulder in distant London, fell a deep gloom.
What manner of woman was this who talked to
him with an unimpassioned, almost cynically,
brutal tone? Who used gaol-slang, spoke of flog-
gings which cut marks on the skin as indelibly as
the iron of the French executioner brands “F”
tm the ToulonForcat, as mere “ticklings?” Good
God ! was she a woman ? And this was to be his
mistress ! For a moment he wavered. Would it
not be better to say that he could not perform the
duties required of him and to tramp back to
Sydney, than put himself under the rule of this
she-wolf? Very likely he would have done so
but the remembrance of Carter’s Barracks with
their attendant horrors rose vividly to his mind,
and with it the thought—“ Better than these,
Anything 1” So he said simply :
“ I can do most things in clerical work.”
“For what were you lagged ?”
Under the fine dust with which the last stage of
his tramp had covered Denham’s face, Miss Latch-
ford perceived a sudden flush and then as sudden
a pallor. But she was relentless. Before he could
answer she pressed another question upon him :
“ And for how long?”
“ Seven years, and for embezzlement.”
“You are innocent, of course ?”
Again the sudden flushing and paling. Denham
had looked his interrogatrix in the face up to this
moment. Now he let his eye fall to the matting.
“No !” he said ; “I was guilty.”
For the first time the features of the lady ex-
pressed an interest in the man. The face of Ser-
geant Derby, too, put on an aspect of surprise. It
was quite anew thing in the experience of both
to come across a transport who, according to his
or her own account, had not been wrongly con-
victed ; and the implied recognition by Denham
of the nominal justice of his sentence conveyed to
them an instantaneous belief in his substantial
truthfulness and trustworthiness which neither,
possibly, would have admitted.

By way of completing her scrutiny, the
Mistress of Hereford Station lifted the pass, which
was lying on Derby’s desk, and audibly ran over
the recapitulation of Convict Denham’s personal
prison characteristics ;
Name, Denham, John; Ship, Ocean ; Register, IVO
oS, 8%8; Age, ‘23; Occupation, Clerk; Education, C;
Religion, C. of E. ; Height, sft.llm. ; Features, Oval ;
Eyes, Hazel ; Forehead, Broad; Hair, Black; Nose, Long;
Teeth, Regular, complete. Marks, Mole on nape of neck ;
General description, Gentlemanly Appearance ami speech,
might y e taken for a swell-mobber, but isn’t. (O sapient
observer 1) Beard and whiskers allowed, by grace of
Burgeon-Superintendent, for good conduct, anil helpful-
ness on voyage.
She checked each particular with her eyes, and
then said: “ I think you will do; but you must
shave. I allow no privileges till they are merited.
You can earn them in three months, if you like.
Can you ride ? ”
As an occasional Sunday trot on a livery-stable
hack was all the equestrian exercise in which
Denham had indulged when a free man; he
thought it best to reply in the negative.
“ Well, we’ll even teach you. The sooner you
begin the better. I will give you a note to the
Woolpack people to tell ’em to saddle you up the
young mare. ’ She sat down, and was scribbling off
the note when the Sergeant, who, knowing the
girl’s ways, had listened" in silence while she had
put her new assigned man on the rack, bent down
and whispered ; “If he can’t ride, Miss Kate,
that skittish thing’ll break his neck. She's nearly
all blood, you know, and not more than half
broken-in.”
Miss Latchford made her rejoinder in her usual,
tones, so that Convict Denham, if he would, need
not have failed to hear her or to understand her.
“ What’s the odds, if he does ? Perhaps it will
save the Government from buying a half-inch rope
for him.”
Denham passed through the pretty garden to
the Woolpack Inn, and resolved as he went that if
the young mare took it into Vat graceful head of
hers (that spoke so plainly of the Diomed straip in
her blood) to break his neck, he would not cross
her purpose.
# * #
While he was about his errand, the Ser-
geant said a few words to Miss Latchford.
“Kate, you are too hard. Mark you, that
young fellow is not one of the ordinary hands. I
know a man of sensitive nature when I see him,
and this chap is one. Treat him kindly; don’t
let him feel he’s a mere brute, to be ordered here
and flogged there, and he’ll do good work for you
and for the world yet, ”
“Have you done your sermon, Sergeant?”
asked Miss Latchford, coolly; “ because, if so, I
want to see Mrs. Derby. ”
“No, I haven’t. I spoke before as a friend.
Now I speak as an officer. I shall make it my
especial business to watch how you treat Denham,
and report to Sydney.”
“Bah! if you have Sturt behind your back, I
have Slyde. Besides, I know Act 5, George IV.,
as well as you do. I know how far I can go with-
out risking the withdrawal of my assigned labour
—if I wanted to drive a man to the devil I can do
so, and still keep within the four corners of the
Acts and the Regulations.”
‘ ‘ Miss Latchford, I believe you’re a Mudie in
petticoats !”
“Derby, how can you!” exclaimed a voice in the
parlour.
“Oh, you’re there, are you, Jeannie?”—and
Miss Latchford turned and held out her hand to
to the Sergeant’s wife. “ The Sergeant says I’m a
feminine Mudie. But you know I’m not, don’t
you, dear? You know I’m simply a woman with
a grievance against Society for making me an old
lag’s daughter. Besides, Mudie is a mere bungler
—he went beyond the four corners ; I keep within
them.”
“I don’t know which is the worse,” growled the
Sergeant.
“ Sergeant,” said the girl in reply to this doubt-
ful compliment, “don’t let’s quarrel. You’ve
been too good a friend to me—you and the little
woman here—for that. Perhaps I’m wr ng--per-
haps, as you say, lam hard-hearted. But I strive
to be just, all the same. I’ll be just to this new
man, but favour him I will not—not even to please
you, for there would be no holding in the other
hands then. You must know that 1 have a hard
task in the management of the Station as it is,”
“I don’t want you to favour him,” said the
Sergeant, partially mollified ; “I want you to be
just. And if you are you’ll treat him kindly.”
‘‘-the little woman” came forward and joined
their hands.
“ There, you big people,” she cried, “ shake !
And if I find you quarrelling again I’ll take it out
of both of you !”
I his awful threat terrified the disputants so
much that they instantly sealed amity with a
laugh.
» # #
Not to go too much into detail, we may say
that the young Diomed mare did not break the
neck of John Denham, No. 38,328, per Ocean,
either on the first time ho bestrode her, or on the
many subsequent occasions. He proved his com-
petency to do the work Miss Latchford required
at his hands, and more. First as clerk and store-
keeper, then as manager and confidential man, ho
served her, as faithfully as (perhaps more faithfully
than) any free man would have done.
The station was one of the largest in the South,
and included both mountain country and a rich
champaign, so that both cattle and sheep were
grazed successfully. Old Latchford, Kate’s
father, had been one of Gov. Macquarie’s “ eman-
cipist _ petsand by thrift, hard work, and an
adaptiveness of faculty and fertility of resource,
rare even among British colonists, had delved and
bred a small fortune out of his 500-acre grant on
the Hawkesbury. With that small fortune at his
command, he had been one of the first to follow in
Hume and Morell’s footsteps as they trended to
the luxuriant South. He had taken up a big run
before the country became a “surveyed district,”
between _ the Tumut and the Bogongs, and had
stocked it with what capital remained after he had
made the few hundred acres immediately sur-
rounding his homestead-site a freehold, “A second-
fleeter ” himself, he had married, as soon as he
was “ freed,” the daughter of a fellow-” lag.” His
child, Kate, was born at the Hawkesbury Farm.
Educated in Sydney, she had not been brought to
the Station till after her mother’s death. She had
then been sent-for by her father, “to keep him
company,” as he said; he was so lonely ; and she
obeyed. A few months passed, and he, too, died ;
and she was left alone—owner of a great and un-
encumbered property, with, in addition to her
run, three maize-farms on the alluvial flats of
Tumut, and £SOOO at 15 per cent, interest—
mortgages in the “ Thirties” were worth holding—
with 30 assigned and 10 free servants at her beck
and call; with youth, and health, and exceptional
beauty—-and an unhappy spirit. Upon the golden
fruit which Fortune gave her, there was one fatal
speck which eat into its heart and robbed it—to
Kate Latchford’s palate—of all sweetness. She
was one “lag’s” daughter, and the grand-daughter
of another. Proud and sensitive naturally, her
disposition grew prouder and more hardened year
by year, as new vistas of life opened before her
gaze, only to be blocked by that one stain.
Brooding constantly on her darkened ancestry,
she exaggerated its effect on her own career.
Suitors came to her, of no purer descent, and her
reply was : “ What? Bring children into the world
to have the finger of scorn pointed at them—
never.” And to others, sons of families whose
ancestral skeletons had never worn the broad
arrow, her answer was the same. She was too
brave, too proud, to desert the field and seek
retirement in another land from scenes that daily
recalled to her mind thraldom (for so she regarded
it); so she trod her path alone, generally misun-
derstood, and, save for little Mrs, Derby, and
using the word in the exact sense, friendless.
One woman out of ten thousand so far as mental
capacity for managing a great and various pro-
perty went; this peculiar notion of hers, mono-
maniac almost in its intensity, made her daily
round one of acute torture. To have to do with
brutalised and devilised convicts inflicted upon
her an unremitting pang, for her morbid con-
sciousness would remind her that between them
and her there was one link, one mutual tie : they
were alike Children of the System. She hated the
necessity for employing assigned labour; hated
the free labour because she could not get enough
of it; hated the convicts for her kinship with
them; hated herself for hating them.
* * *
Denham’s trustworthiness and his ap-
titude for control which had rapidly mani-
fested itself ' was therefore a godsend to her.
Gradually, in token of his usefulness, she ex-
tended to him every privilege allowed under the
Regulations, and several that were not. She gave
him wages and permitted him to speculate in a
purchase of maize, and contemplated (though this
he knew not) advancing to him the money to stock
a 640-acre farm as soon as he was due for his
“ticket.” She would take his opinion, also, on
other matters besides those connected with the
the management of her business affairs. With
some of his first wages he had sent to Tegg,
the Sydney bookseller, and had ordered a few
books. These, of had come addressed to
her care and she had opened the parcel. Taking a
volume mechanically in her hand, she glanced at
a few pages. The book was an edition of Words-
worth. Fairly well-taught in the subjects included
in the course of a fashionable Sydney board ng-
school of the late Twenties, she knew nothing
of literature. Denham, for his age, was well-
read ; and the occasional talks between them
about books which arose did both of them
good. They helped to satisfy a craving of Den-
ham’s nature, while they stimulated a wholesome
desire for culture in hers, to which she had hitherto
been a stranger. But talks about business, about
the land (which was beginning to.be the problem
it still is), about politics generally and about
books, made up their intercourse. He was the
confidential man, and. of course, knew her position
thoroughly, but she never invited his confidence.
She franked the letters he addressed to his mother
in England, but never asked a word about his
relations or his antecedents, nor put a single in-
quiry as to the circumstances under which he was
transported. She never asked him to share a
meal with her; never asked him, indeed, to sit
down in her presence ; never called him by his
Christian name, but always “Denham.” She was
ever the Mistress, and he ever the assigned man.
She enforced the utmost respect of word and
gesture, even to the morning salute; and he granted
it, as became a Government man who had for-
feited his individuality when he became a criminal.
The maintenance of this disciplinary relationship
kept alive his sense of inferiority and forbade him
to forget that ho was, socially— not a cipher, cer-
tainly, but a number—No. 38,328. But for it, he
would have been as happy as was possible under
any conditions of penal servitude. He was
esteemed by his mistress and by Derby, in whom
he found a staunch friend and sound adviser ;
and with respect to the station-hands and to
the outsiders with whom Miss Latchford’s busi-
ness brought him into contact, ho was obeyed by
the one, and viewed by the other class with at
least the form of respect. With the assigned
servants he had many a tussle in his capacity of
manager, and been subjected to many a brutal in-
sult, but in time he boro down all opposition. His
success was the more notable as the neighbouring
station-overseers ruled their assigned labour
chiefly with the lash. Denham, when the reins of
management were in his hand, never reported a
man to the Tumut Bench for a floggable offence,
except once, and then only for cruelty to a horse.
But, suddenly, just as was born the New Year,
before whose close he would be practically a free-
man by virtue of a ticket-of-leave, there came the
end—or what seemed to be the end—to all his
peacefulness and hopefulness of mind. Like the
effect of a storm which, precipitating itself from a
smiling sky into the heart of an inland lake, beats
with a tropic fury the placid water into tempestu-
ous rage, so were the smoothly-rippling relations
between Denham and Miss Latchford fearfully
interrupted.
She had him flogged.
* * *
One of Miss Latchford’s assigned servants,
a mere lad, nicknamed “The Cockney Kinchin,”
was kept about the house to perform some non-
descript duties. Part page, part stable-boy, part
gardener’s-assistant, he had access to the whole
establishment, and being a born thief, preserved
his larcenous faculties in undiminished lustre by
constant practice. He could no more help stealing
than he could help breathing; all was fish that
came to his net, from the silver thimble of the
mistress to the groom’s stirrup-leathers. He rarely
escaped detection; he knew if it was his fate to
steal, it was equally his fate to be found out; and
he stole all the same. Society had punished him
when it should have studied him. Afflicted with
the criminal neurosis, he was less a law-breaker
than a problem in morals. Miss Latchford, how-
ever, looked upon him as simply a boy who, being
thievish, required punishment, and, milder reme-
dies failing to effect reform, had threatened him
on the discovery of his next offence with the lash.
The disciplining of the farm and station-hands
she loft to Denham ; that of the house-servants
she reserved to herself.
On an early January Sunday, the “Cockney
Kinchin ” stole a silver pencil-case, which Miss
Latchford had thoughtlessly laid down for a
minute in her sitting-room. The trinket was
found on him, and he was ordered to be ready at
seven o’clock the next morning, to be taken into
Tumut for report to,the magistrates—the Monday
happening to be the fortnightly court-day.
The lad begged Overseer Denham’s intercession.
He promised it, and was crossing from his office
to his mistress’ apartments when, by an evil,
chance, she came out on the back verandah.
Things might have been different had he met
her alone;
Saluting her and doffing his “cabbage-tree,” he
begged her to resign her resolve; and tried to
show her that, wliile kindness and education
might reform the “Kinchin,” punishment was
powerless to that end.
Now, Miss Latchford was one of those fatally-
conscientious persons who “stick to their word ”
at whatever prejudice to their better judgment,
and at whatever cost to her interests.
“Never,” she said, sharply. “I have said he
shall bo flogged, and he shall be !” Then some
demon prompted her to add: “And you forget
yourself—if you cross my will, I’ll have you flogged
as well. ”
She spoke loudly and the numerous hands about
enjoying their Sabbath rest, heard—and were in-
terested, yon may be sure !
“Oh, no,” rejoined Denham, with a smile,
“you would not do that!” He had meant the
answer as a respectful sort of joke. She read it as
conveying defiance and a subtle presumption, as
though he knew he was too valuable to her to be
treated as another assigned servant would be in
the case of disobedience.
Was she to be sneered at, flouted, disobeyed, by
her assigned man and in the presence of other
convict labour?
“Won’t I?” she said; “I’ll show you who’s
mistress, my flash chap.” (She lapsed into slangy
phrases in her passion.) “I’ll show you that if
I’m a lag’s daughter I’m also a lag’s boss. I'll
take you in myself to the beaks to-morrow and get
you fifty. ”
The Sabbath peace that penetrated even into
the kitchens and the men’s huts at Latchford’s
that evening was unusually peaceful and Sabbatic.
There was something so consoling in the fact that
the Overseer was “booked for the beak.” After
all, there must have been a good deal of “ human
nature ” in the assigned hands : they felt so very
virtuous over Denham’s downfall.
“He’ll get a lessen,” quoth She-Oak Jim, in
the stockman’s hut—Jim was an amiably-disposed
gentleman with 23 convictions—“ not to be so
and— —and uppish when he’s ’ed a taste o’ th’ cat.”
* s *
Faithful to her determination, Miss Latch-
ford took Denham and the “Kinchin” into the
Tumut Court next day.
Mr. Slyde, of Sydney, P.M. and Commission-
agent, mindful 6f possible exigencies on a station-
run by assigned labour, had furnished his fair
client with half-a-dozen sets of “darbies.”
At seven o’clock on the Monday morning she
stood on her verandah-step, and as Denham and
the “ Kinchin ” brought round the dog-cart in
which all three were to travel to Tumut, she flung
a pair of the shiny, steel things at the former’s
feet. Looking straight at the Overseer, she
ordered him to fix the one bracelet to tbe “ Kin-
chin's” left wrist. One mute look of protest he
gave her, and then obeyed.
She descended the step—and with her own
hands snapped the other on to Denham’s right
wrist. She motioned them to get into the veh.Vi
I hey scrambled up somehow, and she follow^
* * *
She timed, their arrival at the court-hous
just as the knot of customary loungers was at '•?’
thickest, immediately before the openin'* of h
sittings. Apparently she had made up her mi, ?
to spare Denham no single drop of humiliatin' 1
The chat and jokes of the loaf its merged hit
startled silence as they saw that the “ g o „° a
Beauty ” meant to flog her overseer. That tin?
was her determination was as plainly to be read **
her face as though it were printed in bold type ° U
■She called to the Sergeant to take the charge •
he was passing from his office into the court-romf
with the Police-Magistrate. Wonderingly j U
came forward, and touched his shako to her. 116
“ What is it, Miss Latchford ?” he asked.'
“ 1 charge the boy with larceny ; the man with
insubordination. ” 1
The Sergeant repeated, hesitatingly, “Insubor
dination ? You know that means flogging, Miss
“ I do ! ” she said ; and Derby knew her too well
to attempt to alter her mind when she spoke h
that tone. He said no more, and directed a con-
stable to remove the prisoners. With Denham"
he found a chance to speak and was informed ~e
the facts of the case. ' ‘
# # %
At this period, the bare and unsupported
testimony of an employer all but invariably
sufficed to prove any save a capital change against
an assigned servant. The only hope the accused
had was to break down the employer’s testimony
by cross-examination. The police never interfered
between master and man ; that is, on the man’s
side; but all that Sergeant Derby could do'for
Denham he resolved to attempt.
Miss Latchford’s evidence against her overseer
was. couched in general terras ; the substantial fact
she unconsciously exaggerated, and distorted in
her passion—but it served. He had interfered
to prevent the punishment of the boy, Harris (alias
the Cockney “Kmchen’.) charged with larceny, and
was thus insubordinate. Now, “insubordination”
was the most heinous offence within summary
jurisdiction; and Convict Denham, declining to
cross-examine the prosecutrix, was forthwith sen-
tenced to fifty lashes.
As Miss Latchford was leaving the box, Ser-
geant Derby addressed the Bench.
“If you please, your Worship, as Assistant
Muster-Master, I apply for the cancellation of the
assignment of the prisoner to Miss Latchford.”
The Mistress of Hereford Station had not
bargained for matters taking this turn. She had
never given a thought to the contingency that she
might bo deprived of Denham’s services. But
Derby was within his powers in making the
application. Though, as Sergeant, he might not
intervene between her and her assigned man as
Assistant Muster-Master, he was entitled, just
grounds Being forthcoming, to make such an
application as that he had. now preferred to the
court.
“What are your reasons, Sergeant?” questioned
the P.M. _ “Is the application made at the desire
of the assignee ? ”
“No!” said Miss Latchford ; “H, is against
my wish.”
The Court looked surprised.
Cor the Sergeant to have declared his real
reason would have been to have the Court against
him. But he was resolved that Miss Latchford
should not regain Denham’s services, so he
diplomatised.
“ The prisoner, your Worship, was Miss Latch-
ford’s overseer. Now, if he goes back after
punishment to her employ, and is re-instated, his
authority over the other Government men would
be gone. If ho is not re-instated, they will—l
know these men, your Worship—they will revenge
themselves upon him in his daily association with
them for having exercised a former authority over
them. They will act in such a way that His
Majesty’s peace would be endangered.”
Now, if there was one thing that the P.M. had
at heart more than another, or one phrase oftener
than others on his lips, it was “ His Majesty’s
peace.” Derby’s plausible argument told, and the
order was made, the Court courteously inclining
its learned head to Miss Latchford, as iie said, in
suave tones ;■ —
“I think it is best —er—-Miss Latchford, tu
relieve you—er —of Convict No. 38,328’s presence.
It would be very unpleasant—er—for you were
there any disturbance—er—on your estate.”
The mistress of Hereford scarcely heard the
words. She no sooner grasped the fact that she
had lost Denham’s services than the scales fell
from her eyes, and she saw (to do her justice) not
alone his money value to her, but those things
which no money could purchase—his fidelity,
intelligence, and zeal. Stirred by an irresistible
impulse, she moved towards where, a minute
before, he was standing, with some vague, ill-
defined intention of begging his pardon. But he
bad gone ; or rather had been removed, and was
at that moment stripping in the court-yard. The
spotlessness of Justice in N.S.W. tempux Will.
IV. was only equalled by the promptitude with
which her fiats were carried out.
# # #
Subdued, with strange emotions struggling
in her heart, and with a most unwonted desire for
that feminine panacea, “ a good cry,” Miss Latch-
ford thought she would pay Mrs. Derby a visit,
while waiting till the wretched Kinchin had
recovered from his whipping sufficiently to go
for her dog-cart to the Woolpack Inn.
She was making her way to the front of the
premises immediately occupied by the “little
woman,” when the Sergeant confronted her.
“You want my wife, Miss Latchford?” he
asked, with a stern gravity.
She could not trust herself to speak. She
nodded.
“ Mrs. Derby is not in—to you,” he said.

DE. JENKINS
Treats sucessfully all forms of Nervous,
Chronic, and Private Diseases, no matter of
how long standing or however complicated.
TO THE UNFORTUNATE
Who through ignorance and folly have trifled away
their strength, become axnbitionless in life, en-
feebled in power, and to whom existence is scarcely
bearable, Dr. Jenkins says
COME AND BE HEALED
As the terms upon which patients are treated, viz.,
NO CUBE NO FEE, enables all sufferers to avail
themselves of this remarkable opportunity of
obtaining a speedy and effectual cure. Dr. Jenkins
wishes it to be distinctly understood that he does
not rely upon the issue of books, more often never
written by the persons whose names they bear, and
are mere traps for the unwary, but honestly and
straightforwardly treats his patients according to
the dictates of a sound medical training.
