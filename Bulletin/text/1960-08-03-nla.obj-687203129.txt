WOMEN IN THE JUNGLE
Three interesting “documentary”
books, all of considerable importance
to Australia, are Jungle Nurse, by
Pamela Gouldsbury (Jarrolds). Doctor’s
Wife in New Guinea, by Margaret
Spencer (Angus and Robertson), and
Speak You So Gently, by Kylie
Tennant (Gollancz).
Mrs. Gouldsbury is the wife of an
Englishman who for 10 years was a
police - superintendent in Malaya.
Chance ministrations to a family of
Malayan negritos brought such an inva-
sion of other negrito families for medi-
cal treatment that she persuaded the
administration into setting her up an
amateur hospital for them, secured
army patrols to be her bodyguards
against Communist terrorists when she
visited them in their villages, argued
with Field-Marshal Templer against
gathering the negritos together in
segregated communities and. when he
later admitted that she had been right
and he wrong, visited by helicopter the
string of forts from which native affairs
were administered and whose establish-
ment she had advocated in the first
place.
Mrs. Spencer is a doctor’s wife who
spent a year with him in the Wahgi
Valley of New Guinea, and kept a diary
in which with casual ease she gradu-
ally builds-up a picture of the people:
their marriage-customs; the way the
young girls make their toilet before
going out to startle the men. smearing
themselves with pig-grease, painting
themselves with sing-sing paint from
rows of little bottles, and. “with the
air of one who puts on her hat.” push-
ing a crescent of pearlshell through
the hole in their hoses; the mass-
slaughter of pigs (they ate meat at only
certain times of the year) by men in
pig-killing wigs. She liked to gossip
with the native wives:—
It is like having an enormous
family., all the members with the
child’s touching faith in the adult's
ability to straighten out any diffi-
culty. Are they being robbed at the
trade stores? Will I please mend
this? Can they buy one of my
fowls? Will I order goods for a
party they want to give? Have 1
seen the keys they have lost? What
can they do about sick pigs? Will
we give them a picture-show? Will
1 write an address and stamp a
letter? Will I sew the edges of all
the medical orderlies' new lap-laps?
A kanaka wants to sell a stone-axe
because he wants to buy a bush-
knife. and so on all day. Or I will
have a gossip in pidgin with some-
body.; or a woman will come with
an aggrieved face to tell me her
husband has beaten her ; or a man
will want advice on what size
trousers' he needs, or a ukelele
ordered from Madang for him. One
of the station natives approached me
to sew-up his trousers, which had
split along a seam. I did so, and then
he wanted to give me a shilling, so
that in future 1 would sew-up all
his clothes for him at a shilling a
time . . .
Kylie Tennant did not. like Mrs,
Gouldsbury and Mrs. Spencer, have a
husband in the district to lure her
away from civilisation; her first sent-
ence explains that, as the Eskimos lent
their wives to friends going long sled-
journeys. so she herself was lent by her
husband to the Rev. Alfred Clint to
be his secretary at the Lockhart River
Mission on top of Cape York Peninsula.
Her book records two visits to the
Mission and its co-operative store for
the aborigines, one with her young son,
the other with her daughter; in which
-we see the Mary Lockhart, “that dreary,
greasy, little maid-of-all-work with her
disgracefully weedy bottom and her
sail stained with diesel smoke.” which
sank and had to be dragged along the
sea-bottom to be beached and drained;
and kindergarten classes in which Kylie
Tennant taught new nursery-rhymes:—
Clap hands for Daddy comes home,
Daddy comes home in the boat.
Bring me a trochus, bring me a pearl,
Daddy comes home in the boat.
There is a red-haired woman-
missionary with huge vegetable- am
pineapple-gardens; a visit to Moa an
a moving account of the death of
native at Kuban; an investigation of
painted rocks; a parting-present 0
woven grass-mats; a picture of fo
author as a counter-jumper worried!
filling the orders of crowds of blaci
customers at the co-op. store; and
around and over everything a set of
brisk pen-portraits of everyone within -
the sphere of influence of the bool
from Sydney’s Christchurch St
Lawrence and its political and religious
environs to the breezy church-
dignitaries of the north, the officials off
the Department for Native Affak
and the embarrassed geologists and
engineers, minions of the menace ol

active minerals looked like turning th:

far-sighted planning. In fact, Queensland’s pros-
pects for continued progress are so bright, so
assured, that a £190,000,000 plan for electrical
development must be put into effect during the next
decade. And with Queensland’s growing influence
on the nation’s affairs, this is a task which must
interest every Australian. It is a task, too, in which
you, as an Australian, are asked to join—by your

AFRICA AND THE WORLD
HTHE fiftieth-anniversary year of the
A foundation of the Union of South
Africa seems likely to be more remem-
bered as the year in which Africa
reverted to the Africans.
This was inevitable, in time, in all
the British colonies of the north and
centre, with perhaps the exception of
Kenya, where there has been substantial
British settlement; but it was certainly
not intended that so-called “freedom”
should come until the countries con-
cerned were able to govern themselves
and stand on their own feet.
In the mind of the Briton, even in
the short period of jingoistic Empire-
building, of which Disraeli was the
father, there was always an underlying
repugnance to the idea of world
dominion; an uneasiness generated by
the suspicion that there was something
foreign about the idea, strongly salted
with the knowledge that the ruling of
far places was a costly business.
Of course the American and Euro-
pean press, not to mention the poli-
ticians, were more openly opposed to
it on the false premise that British
colonies brought big revenues into the
City of London and were the source of
Britain’s wealth; that even the Indian
was ground under the heel of the British
exploiter till the juice ran out of him.
In plain fact, one of the most diffi-
cult tasks of British rule in India was
to keep a little juice in the unfortun-
ate native who, through all the ages,
had been in the wringer of that enter-
prising usurer the village bunnia.
In most other colonies in which the
British have been involved the rulers
have been faced with curing some other
problem connected with the discom-
forts of the native inhabitants —expen-
sively to the British taxpayer.
To the British habit of colonisation
Asia owes its Western education and
standards of health and efficient admini-
stration. To the world it brought abo-
lition, over a great part , of it, of the
slave-trade and such boons as the
gradual wiping-out of malaria and
other fevers.
However, the do-gooders of America,
with their allies (on this issue) in the
Soviet Union, having forced the British
and Continental countries by the weight
of world opinion (including that of the
propagandised British themselves) to
“disgorge” their “conquests” to the
local indigenes, can scarcely be happy
about their predicament.
A BOUT the only people who have
temporarily are the negro
leaders themselves missionary - edu-
cated or products of American univer-
sities, or members of one of the English
Inns of Court, who speak English words
without always understanding them.
These leaders are mostly at a stage of
evolution in which democracy is only a
word to them, and they impose on their
peoples, perforce, a despotic rule like
that in Ghana, which sends the Opposi-
tion to detention-camps, gets two votes
cast where one exists, and has a press
whose tone seems to be taken from the
jungle.
Neither they nor any of their fellows
are trained for administration, yet they
are saddled with responsibilities for
which there is no properly organised
economy which they can control to pay
for the work.
Their greatest anxiety is that the
U.K., the country they have cursed in
chorus with the Soviet Union and the
New York journals as an imperialistic
tyranny, shall not desert them in their
hour of need.
Some of the nations which have
been “freed” have found a decade
quite enough to rid them of a lot of
delusions. India, the pioneer of the
“liberated,” which thought even a
million deaths achieved in a religious
pogrom a small price for independence,
has lost a great deal of its original
sense of gratitude to the Soviet Union
and others for pressing its cause.
Nehru has ceased to apologise for
Russian tyrannies and slaughters since
last year’s events in Tibet. And ceased,
too, to vaunt his belief that Moscow
believes that Asia is for the Asians,
since he has learned in a highly practi-
cal way that his menacing neighbors
interpret this to mean Asia for the
Communist Revolution, Moscow and
Peking.
Others have learned the same lesson
the hard way, and all who have had
time to sort out the realities from the
dreams are now showing a tendency
to rebind their associations with the
British Commonwealth.
Looking at the position in Africa,
nobody, even in the most rabid anti-
British quarters in the United States, .
can feel easy about the part of that
country in encouraging resistance to
“colonial” rule of backward peoples
The Russians, of course, are in a differ,
ent position, since their opposition to
“imperialism” is merely a device to for-
ward the world-revolution, after which
there will be only one “imperialist” and
“colonialist” Power ruling the whole
world from Moscow.
The Congo will stand as the worst
example of what the anti-imperialists
have achieved. The Belgians, in con-
sonance with the world trend of
opinion, designed to hand self-govern-
ment to the vast, unhealthy and savage
colony when it had become fit to govern
itself. But charged with repression and
brutality by its own Socialists, faced
with foreign-fomented rebellion of the
almost-naked tribesmen of the Western
part of the territory, they were forced
to hand-over government to mission-
educated natives, though they agreed to
leave a regiment of Belgian administra-
tors to run the machinery of govern-
ment until natives could be trained to
the task. They also provided officers
for a force of military police to keep
the tribes from slaughtering each other.
Whipped to a fury by the heady
oratory of Lumumba at the inaugura-
tion ceremonies of the new republic on
June 30, however, those who had been
itching for the good old days set about
at once oversetting this prudent arrange-
ment amid the cheers and encourage-
ment of Moscow.
The price in murder, rape, rapine
and discouragement to colonising
countries to grant independence to
primitive native peoples has been
immense and terrible.
True, the United Nations Secretariat
continues to treat the Congo leaders as
civilised and reasonable beings, but the
fact is that the fate of the Congolese
under their rule is apt to be much more
horrible than under that of the Belgians
at their long-past worst.
/'"'ONGO, in its present state, is on the
way back to the jungle, or into the
slave-camp of Communist rule.
The most unpleasant aspect, how-
ever, is that the propaganda of
Lumumba and his political witch-
doctors has communicated itself to
Kenya and the Rhodesias, and once
more has endangered the lives and
property of thousands of white settler 8
and natives and the industries on which
all the regions in Africa under British
rule prosper.
The disturbances also have made h
almost certain that independence m
those regions will come by pressure
rather than by an orderly process based
on mutual consent and organisation a
in the Sudan, Ghana and other tern*
tories. These have obtained sen'
government, in some cases republic 3

THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN


PLAIN ENGLISH
Rule by Hardihood
Mr. Nixon became the Republican
Presidential candidate at a razzle-dazzle
in Chicago Stockyards which was called
a “convention” and which seems to
have been even more incredible in
its flamboyancy and noise than that
which chose his rival, Mr. Kennedy,
as the Democratic nominee. The con-
testants are now set for the three-months-
long race for election as a President of
the United States.
The more sober-thinking part of the
world will wait with anxiety on
the result, not so much because of any
partisanship on one side or the other,
but because there is good cause to
wonder about the condition in which the
winner will approach the gigantic task
of being President.
The President of the United States
certainly has the biggest job in the world.
His Cabinet is without responsibility to
the Legislature in the sense in which
Ministers are responsible in Australia,
Canada and the United Kingdom. They
are basically only assistants to the Presi-
dent.
Under the provisions of the U.S.
Constitution “the executive power” of a
nation of nearly 180 millions is vested
in the President. He is “commander-in-
chief of army and navy and head of
executive departments.”
With the “advice and consent” of the
Senate he makes all treaties, appoints
Ambassadors and nearly all senior
officers of the Administration, and he
virtually supervises world affairs in these
days.
The intrusion of the formerly isolated
Republic into the international field with
all its obligations of travel and consulta-
tion with foreign heads of State and
Prime Ministers' has added enormously
to his responsibilities.
The 1960 contest is one between two
young men, the one 42 and the other 47,
each backed by vast business interests
with huge stakes in the election, and
concerned rather to secure the elec-
tion of somebody who will be pliable
than somebody who will be great and
independent.
The battle will be long, unceasing,
hysterical and fought with no holds
barred. It will be the fiercer because of
the youth and aggressiveness of both the
candidates and because of the elaboration
of glare and noisiness as modern aids
to campaigning—TV, radio, neon-lights
and tape-recorders.
For the 40 years antecedent to the
current poll, it has generally been an
anxious question whether a President
could sustain himself in unimpaired
mental vigor through his period or
periods of office.
Wilson was a mental and physical in-
valid at the end of his term, Harding died
ignominiously in office, Roosevelt was
unfit for his duties when he represented
the country at the world’s most important
conference in a century—at Yalta —and
General Eisenhower is obviously an ail-
ing man, depleted in drive and mental
vigor after his long service in war and
peace.
The question has now become whether
the matter has 'not gone a stage further ;
whether, in fact, any candidate, even
young bulls of the ring full of vim and
bellow like the two contestants now en-
tering the arena, can survive the trials
of the Presidential campaign sufficiently
undebilitated to be capable of carrying
out the duties of the Presidency with the
needful calm judgment, vigor and clarity
and firmness of mind.
By the time of the 1964 preliminaries
it might even be a question whether any
candidate can survive the party conven-
tion without dropping dead or going
deaf and color-blind.
Untapped "Immigration 11
A. R. Downer, Minister for Immigra-
tion, in the Roy Milne lecture said that
one of the major effects of the European
content of immigration would inevitably
be a lessening of ties with Britain.
Lessening of ties with Britain is per-
haps inevitable in any case, though had
immigration remained entirely British,
racial origin would certainly have kept
a strong link in existence.
Now Mr. Downer doubts it possible
to secure a greater intake of the British
than the present 65,000, including
homing Australians. And the United
Kingdom Government, although it favors
immigration as a policy, does very little
about it.
The fact is, of course, that the British
population is not growing very much,
and the U.K. is short of labor.
Australia wants population, and
quickly, but history has taught that
numbers are not everything and that
large populations of mixed and un-
assimilable strains have been the begin-
ning of the downfall of every great
nation.
Rome fell when it ceased to be Roman
and became a polyglot agglomeration of
races.
It became great as a homogenous small
city State.
Britain attained its greatness as one
of the smallest of the nations of the
earth both territorially and in popula-
tion. But it has proved itself, through
all vicissitudes and all triumphs, whether
expanding or contracting, one of the
two or three toughest and most enduring
nations of all history.
The principal ingredients in national
greatness seem to have been proved by
history to be racial unity.
Quality counts more than quantity.
One only has to contrast the solidity of
the British people and the disintegrating
influences which are turning the United
States into a sort of social and political
bedlam.
It is questionable whether the present
Australian immigration policy, based on
a theory that numbers are the prime
factor and that any European will do,
is the right one for this country.
The old theory that unless this country
carries many millions, even polyglot,
acquired at breathless haste, the Asiati
hordes will descend on it, is outmoded
in a world in which the small State
especially one strategically vital, has come
into its own and —temporarily at least—
has global protection.
A lot of the mixed immigrants now
coming here are not assimilating.
The Americans in Korea, with their
draftees, learnt to their cost the price of
being polyglot.
It would be better to go slowly than
to dilute the fibre of the British races
which were hardening into a solid core
of Australian nationalism before World
War 11. /
There is a source of “immigration”
that is not being exploited because of
failure to provide housing and other
incentives for the ' British-Australian
population—that is, increase in the birth-
rate.
National Aid for City Housing
Acting on two independent reports on
Melbourne inner areas by the Housing
Commission’s senior architect and slum-
research officer, Minister for Housing
Horace Petty has come up with a national
scheme for the redevelopment of run-
down areas in Australian cities.
He recommends a slum-abolition pro-
ject in which Federal and State Govern-
ments should acquire run-down (and not
necessarily just slum) areas and that the
land should be sold at economic prices
to private builders for the construction
of modern units.
The investigators, who have also re-
cently been looking at overseas slums,
find that there are 1000 acres of run-
down and depressed houses in inner Mel-
bourne. In the early ’fifties, the cost
of clearing the sites and preparing them
for redevelopment was about £20,000 an
acre. It is now between £40,000 and
£50,000, and the areas are probably in-
creasing faster than the rate of the
Housing Commission’s activities, since
these are limited by the State Treasury,
It would take £5O million to buy the
Melbourne depressed areas, clear them
and make them available for building,
but they could be used to build about
40 walk-up flats to the acre; and it
£4OO was allowed as a land cost for each,
the sale of the land for rebuilding would
return £l6 million.
Petty proposes that the loss should
be shared by the Federal and State
Governments in each State. It would not
be possible for local municipal o (
government instrumentalities to contri-
bute towards this loss, Tut as they would
benefit considerably from addition 31
rates, they could agree to pay the in-
creased rates to the redevelopin'
authority for about a decade. ,
It is obvious the plan would n ee
chiefly funds from Federal Government
but since slum-reclamation is dealt y 1
overseas on a national basis, the Mi®
ter’s proposal is not
especially as Victoria is taking such
substantial part in the migrant p°P ula
tion-growth. . J
A similar project on a comparator
small scale of 2\ acres, which was
cently described in The Bulletin,


been successful in North Melbourne,
here the Housing Commission bought
depressed properties for about £40,000
an acre and master-builders organised a
company which bought the site at £5OO
for each flat built on it.
Almost all of them have been sold at
modest prices on an own-your-own basis,
and the company is buying more sites
for further development; but the rate
of redevelopment, from limited sources,
is slower than the growth of depressed
areas.
Unpaid and Honorary
From E. H. McGrath, branch presi-
dent, Administrative and Clerical
Officers’ Association, Commonwealth
Public Service, Sydney:
In an article on page 7 of B. 27/7/’6O
you described me as a “poor professional
trade-union watch-dog” and a “sad toiler in
the wage-rise industry.”
Being aware of The Bulletin’s record for
accuracy I know you will be only too willing
to advise your readers that, in fact, I am
the unpaid and honorary president of the
N.S.W. Branch of the Administrative and
Clerical Officers’ Association, Commonwealth
Public Service, and that I perform my associa-
tion duties in my own time —lunch-hours
and after work —without recompense and at
a great deal of personal inconvenience.
During normal hours of duty I am just another
public servant doing my best to serve the
public in a large Federal department.
I would not like your readers to think
that when I speak on behalf of the thousands
of public servants who elect me to office at
annual secret ballots that I do so because
lam a “professional.” I only speak on
their behalf because I believe in the justice
of their claims for better conditions of
employment and because I happen to be their
president at this point in time.
Incidentally, the association is non-political,
it is not affiliated with any Trades Hall groups
or political parties, and our claims for the
28 p.c. marginal increases, as well as our
complaints at the rejection of those claims,
are directed against the principles of wage
inequity and not against Governments as such.
h your feature-writers in future desire
clarification on important points of this
nature before putting pen to paper I will be
happy to explain to them the facts of the
situation.
With your right to criticise our claims for
oetter working conditions I, of course, have
no quarrel.
You— and most other newspapers—have
imost always opposed public service wage
ises and at the same time criticised the public
ervice for its alleged inefficiency. In this
mocracy w e recognise your right to take
n a stand even though we disagree with
your views.

Barents Sea after being last heard from
200 miles off the nearest point on the
Russian coast, and then shot-down over
territorial waters when it was found im-
possible to shepherd it inside Soviet
waters.
He denounced the Russian version as
a “complete fabrication,” and a “poor
attempt to cloak wanton attack on a
plane over international waters” in-
volving a “flagrant disregard of the
standards of international conduct.”
On July 26 Cabot Lodge said:
I have explained that the United States
possesses scientific devices which followed
the RB-47 throughout its flight. I am
sure that Soviet military authorities would
like to know all about these devices, but
I can assure you that the United States
is not going to give them that satisfaction
—it is not going to divulge our military
secrets.
The surprising thing is that Mr.
Kuznetsov sees no need to present evidence
for his assertion. He makes the charge
and then I make an answer, and he expects
me to prove my answer, but he does not
prove his charge. What kind of backward
thinking is that? For Mr. Kuznetsov
it is enough that someone in Moscow in
authority has made-up this story and for
that reason it becomes holy writ. But we
are not in Moscow; we are in the United
Nations. It makes a great difference....
The Soviet Union is now a great Power.
That fact is universally acknowledged.
Mr. Kuznetsov in his statement here last
Friday spoke again, as his colleagues often
do, of the “growing might and prestige
of the Soviet Union.” But if the Soviet
Union is a great Power with growing might
and prestige, as it is, then it ought to
act like one. It ought not to hide things
as if it were in mortal fear of being caught
doing something wrong. It ought to let
its actions be seen by all of us in clear
daylight. Surely if its system is so strong
it will not be injured by an impartial
investigation into the facts.
What we want is a world in which there
are no Soviet facts or American facts —
there are just facts, universally accepted
by reasonable people all over the world.
That is why I say that if the Soviet Union
in this instance would be willing to have
an investigation, it would certainly be a
very welcome thing and would make an
excellent impression throughout the world.
It would help the Soviet Union, among
other things.
Russia could only muster the servile
vote of its satellite Poland against
the proposal for inquiry by the Inter-
national Court and the second proposal
by the Italians that the Red Cross should
be allowed to see the captured airmen.
It used the veto to defeat both pro-
posals for which the Argentine, the U.K.,
Ceylon, Equador, France, Italy, Tunisia
and the United States voted.
It also had to face a devastating display
of photographic evidence of the
U.S.S.R.’s own spying activities along
the coast of the United States, with no
defence except abuse, and a humiliating
revelation of the fact that none of the
Russian operations had been the secret
the Kremlin believed them to be.

“Spenton”: In my young days of
apprenticeship, circa 1920, morning-tea
for the apprentices was absolutely for-
bidden. Nevertheless, when the morn-
ings were chilly a hot cup of tea was
often smuggled to us by an adoring
office-girl. Two of us were enjoying such
a cup behind the big lathe when we
spotted “Old Memory,” the workshop
boss, coming our way. We hurried
the just-tasted cups onto a ledge which
we thought might be beneath the gaze
of this approaching martinet. In those
days the penalty for the misdemeanors of
an apprentice was to be stood-down for
a day, a week or more, according to the
gravity of the offence. We should have
known that the steaming wisps from the
hot tea would give us away—and sure
enough, “Whose tea is that?” came the
question, while a great grimy forefinger
was directed at the crockery. My mate,
Stan, rose to the occasion: “Bushell’s,
sir.”

The first night she had given them stewed
rhubarb and they had liked it, so she
kept giving them stewed rhubarb. On the
fifth night they all refused it. “Just tell

“Wulworra”: A statement by Henri
Garcia, French writer on Rugby League,
that “a lot of the credit” for the French-
men’s win in the last Test should go to
children at La Perouse, surely merited
a better fate than burial in sporting-
columns. Rugby League, as I saw it in
that Test, is a primitive and rough-house
game, but there is uplifting reflection in
the fact that the youngsters of
Perouse, through their singing of If
Marseillaise in French on Frances
national day, assisted France to defeat
Australia. The performance was gi veD ’
not in the school, as Henri Garcia® 1 '
plied, but at the La Perouse memorial:

men who were at Botany Bay in I7Bjs

covered at Vanikoro, strike me as be®?
rather more internationally - memora®
than the result of the football-match.

“Mick Simmons (Holdings), Ltd., is raising
£139,088 to finance owning and operating
cigarette-vending machines in Sydney metro-
politan area.”
Not long ago the cigarette
Was modest, shy and fancy-free,
It played extremely hard-to-get
Unchaperoned by pounds of tea;
Under the counter it lay hidden
And would not come when it was
bidden.
Now, in the present Age of Gold,
As part of the impersonal
Machine, the cigarette grows bold
For all who have the wherewithal,
Prepared to kiss and burn for you
Or anyone, no matter who.
Alas, how sordid and how mean!
It might be harder to condone
The cruelty of the machine
If many of us had not known
Dispensers made of harder parts,
With brazen faces, iron hearts.

“Bo”: It was during the brief re-educa-

when police were gently chiding the
erring ones, with the get-tough phase to
follow. The cop on the footpath a bit
up-town from the Wynyard crossing
waited for the jay-walking old duck to
hit the pavement. Then he stepped up
to her and said politely: “Sorry to
detain you a moment, Madam, but didn’t
you realise -you were jay-walking then?
You must walk straight across the road.’’
“But I did walk straight across —1
wouldn’t think of dawdling, or I may
get hit by a car,” she replied. “When
I said ‘straight across,’ 1 meant at right-
angles,” he went on. “Well,” Mum came
back, “I do wish you wouldn’t confuse
me with angles and things. I was never

“Imperial 55”: The men in our office
are very normal types, and when new
staff has to be engaged they take a
deep interest in the talent drifting in
for interviews. The interviewer, unless
he takes a firm stand and shuts the door
of his office, has a procession passing
the doorway to look-over the nervous
chicky in the chair. First and foremost
come vital statistics, a bit evasive in
winter, when so many lasses hide their
vitality under shapeless coats, but the
canny interviewer can always offer to
let her take-off the coat while she is in
an air-conditioned office. From bumps-
in-the-right-places, the interviewer goes
on to consider bumps-of-knowledge and
-intelligence. Then voice and speech are
considered. During a crisis when the
men were all busy the senior-typist was


told-off to interview applicants. The boys
protested at once, and gave strict instruc-
tions about the type they wanted. The
office-boy said he would come past and
give the nod or shake after every inter-
view. Choice having been made, the
senior boys doubtfully demanded,
“What’s she like?” The senior-typist had
to admit that she had forgotten the color
of the girl’s eyes, but she did have nice
legs. The boys shook their heads sadly,
and their eyes strayed to the wall, where
a calendar from one of the heavy in-
dustries shows a delicious dish in a filmy
negligee, so delicious a dish that pil-
grimage is made to see her every morn-
ing by that section of the staff neither
too young nor too old to appreciate her
charms. “Nice
legs!” they snorted.

“Tap”: Most worth - while part of a
church group’s performance of a three-

by May Hollinworth at the end of the
show. “Usually,” she said, “I find
myself in the position of having to com-
pliment the audience for being such a
good co-operative crowd to play to, and
reserve my severe strictures for the cast.
Tonight the positions are reversed, for
you were not a good audience. And
this is almost always true of audiences
that comprise friends and relatives of
the actors.” A good point! Familiar
audiences, giggling at the love scenes and
chiacking the heavier dramatic moments,
create an almost impossible atmosphere
for the players. So why doesn’t the Arts

entered in their competitions be per-
formed in the more anonymous city

themselves in close companionship, and
in a moment had the table covered with

tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, etc. Using
the brown-paper bags as plates, and a
penknife as a communal utensil, they
sliced and shelled and mashed their
edibles, and sat munching with all the
aplomb in the world. When a diffident
waitress hovered, they ordered a tomato-
juice apiece, at Is. a glass. Two of the
girls, having consumed their rolls, dis-
covered themselves still hungry, so one
was deputed to run down to the nearby
delicatessen and buy two cream-cakes.

“Swanee”: A token of the Golden

(N.S.W.), still leaves me with mixed
feelings. A quietly-spoken chap, who
said he was the cashier of a big Sydney
firm, arrived for a fortnight’s holiday
with a tennis - racket strapped to his
suitcase. It was the off-season, and
the cashier was more than pleased at
my offer to give him a few sets daily
during my free afternoon hours. I was
away from the office when he paid his
bill and caught his train, but I was sur-
prised to find that he had left me a
pay-envelope with a golden quid in it
and a brief thank-you note. Was sad-
dened to read a few weeks later that
his body had been found in the bush
at Manly and that a check of his
accounts disclosed a serious shortage.
He had chosen suicide rather than
prison. Should I have turned over the

RIGHT SARTORIAL TOUCH
“One of the prized possessions of natives
in some parts of the former Belgian Congo
is a white man’s collar, unadorned. It can
be a symbol either of the wearer’s laziness,
superiority or his bachelor state.”
If you happened to have struck
Some soporific buck
In your perambulations through the
Congo
Vegetating ’neath a tree,
Don’t assume that he must be
An indolent and idle-living drongo.
He’s just fiercely trying to learn
The best way not to earn .
A living; and the symbol you would
know, for
His neck would be encased,
If not exactly graced—
His aim ? To be a good white-collar
loafer.
You may deem it rather odd
When you sight another bod
Who in his tribe’s regarded as a wallah
Simply because he’ll wear
With his G-string an affair
That used to be a three-inch batswing-
collar.
Though in misery he’ll be,
Fettered thus, with the degree
Of temperature nigh one hundred and
forty,
As a stoic he won’t mind
That his throttle’s so confined,
For it makes him feel magnificently
haughty !
But the ones that you would see
Collar-clad would mostly be
Young bloods caught-up in adora-
tion's rapture,
Sable gallants who, inspired
By Eros, have been fired
Some beauteous jungle-damosel 1°
capture.
And what better way than deck
Out an otherwise bare neck
To let the object of his admiration
Know that he is fancy-free,
That he has no ties; you see,
That must convey that he’s in cirr ll
lation.

Tmmigration Minister Downer in a
speech in Sydney deplored the “fashion-

He said that in racial origins, religion
and ideas Australia’s population was
European and that towards Asia “our
role will be that of a rather novel inter-
preter of Anglo-European ideas, institu-
tions and a manner of life, and likewise
in reverse, between Asia and Europe.”
This role might be hampered rather than
helped by a decision to admit Asian
migrants :-t
Instead of relieving misunderstandings
it would provoke tensions. It would
create internal social problems which
fortunately we have hitherto escaped . . .
Instead of enabling us -to fulfil our
mission it could prevent us from carrying
it out.
Advocates of a quota-system always
assume that such a plan would build up
friendship and goodwill between Aus-
tralia and Asia. As Downer points out,
there is no basis for assuming this, and
experience in countries where racial
admixtures have occurred doesn’t encour-
age the belief.

Seamen’s Union went on strike to protest
against his rejection of an application

shipping industry without giving the
award a trial. The usual Communist

the Government to apply for the per-

fails to obey the court and which seeks
to nullify the effects of awards by
planned disruptive tactics.

Lieut.-General Sir Frank Berryman
pays tribute to a great Australian:--
I first really got to know Sam Hordern in
New Guinea, when he took his squadron of
the Ist Armored Regiment to the top of
Sattelberg, outside Finschhafen —a herculean
feat with “I” tanks up that 2500 ft. slope with
the Japs in their bunkers giving all the
opposition they could. I knew him then
as a very tall and very cheerful officer, with
a keenly developed sense of humor, liked by
his men and an inspiration to his squadron.
Later I left the Army and joined the R.A.S.
of N.S.W. as director about the same time
that Sam became president, so we started ott
more-or-less together. I found him with just
the same attributes as in New Guinea. He
knew a lot about animals and did pioneering
work in the development of the Santa
Gertrudis breed. His dynamic energy improved
the all-round activities of the R.A.S. tremen-
dously. He was a great imperialist, believing
that the ties which bind together members
of the British Commonwealth should be
strengthened by every possible means, and it
was largely through him that the R.A.S. of
the Commonwealth was formed. The Eques-
trian Federation of Australia, of which he
was Federal president, also had much to thank
him for.
Loved by everyone who met him, Sam was
one of the biggest-thinking men I’ve ever
met —he was incapable of taking personal
olfence whatever people might do to him.
He always set-out to help people, too. It
was, in a light sort of way, actually very
typical of him that at one time, when he
was in hospital during the war, he organised
his fellow-patients to help with washing-up
and drying, to ease things a bit for the staff.
The only snag was that, being so tall, he
hung the tea-towels up so high to dry that the
nurses had to stand on chairs to get them down.

ABORIGINALITIES
Visiting Moa Island in the Torres
Strait—the one usually known as St.
Paul’s because of the Mission of St. Paul,
a theological college for natives —was a
strange experience. Having been told
that food was not easily come by, and
dear at the only store,! took along stocks
of tinned goods, fresh bread, fresh fruit
and vegetables. It was all very gratefully
received, especially the tinned tomatoes,
which were eaten cold with tinned meat.
The seeds were carefully saved for
planting, and I thought my leg was being
pulled until my hosts showed me tomato-
plants grown from the seed of tinned
tomatoes. Packet-seed, although specially
packed in tinfoil with a preparation to
guard against dampness, was often
mildewed and useless, and the tinned
seed was more viable. Apparently the
tomatoes were processed at a heat low
enough not to kill the germ.
It was Easter-time, and on the Sunday
they had a festival of the Blessing of the
First Fruits. Preceded by altar-boys and
priests clad in scarlet robes, and to the
beat of New Guinea drums, the whole
population of the island marched around
the church, then inside for a short ser-
vice, after which they came outside for
a lecture from the chairman of the
Island Council.
The fruits and flowers they had carried
in their procession had been heaped
before the altar and blessed ; they wore
flowers and foliage in their hair and
around their necks. I was astonished
when the chairman dressed them down,
berating them as lazy and telling them
they must do better in their gardens next
year; but they told me that this is
traditional, and nobody takes any notice
of the tirade.
"I'm sorry , lady—I only saw your tail."
After the service, preparations were
begun to cook the feast. Pigs, saved for
the occasion, were cooked in various
ways, cut into little pieces and roasted,
or made into a stew. We were invited
to the feast, which was about three hours
late postponement seemed to be to
allow everyone to work up a good
appetite for it.
There was an insipid concoction of
pumpkin and yams cooked in coconut-
milk that might have been tasty if salted
and eaten hot —the natives like their
food barely warm —but it was unsalted,l
all served on the best English china and
eaten with good cutlery. Table-linen, too,
was of high quality, as were the towels
I saw the children using. Mail-order cata-
logues are much used in the North, and
nothing is too good or too expensive!
We were served soft-drinks (which the
Islanders love) and a cup of tea after the
feast. When everybody had finished
they all stood and chanted in unison:
“Essau!” which means “Thank you!
Usually a dance follows the feast, and
we were promised this ; but after wait-
ing a long time we found that everyone
had gone home, having decided that it
might rain. They just hadn’t thought tel
inform their guests!

Worst loss lately was of the new Tongan

She was on her first cruise after delivery
from Japan, and insurance had not been
finalised when she went missing with all
hands, including the Japanese master and
her specially-trained Tongan fishing-crew.
There were no distress-signals, and it
has been assumed she passed close to

were made when it was realised she was
missing or in trouble, but all that was

“Bass”: An avicultural society is try-

parrots and finches —on Rottnest Island,
the holiday-resort 10 miles or so off
Fremantle, with the idea of making it
a sanctuary. From a naturalist’s vie
point I don’t like the idea. There's "
obvious reason for it the island”
already the natural habitat or stagin!
ground for about 70 species of bird'
and in any case it’s too close to the
land. The island can’t feed seed- or nut
eaters ; if it could they’d already ha\ e
established themselves there; and jj
some of the released birds accepted hand
feeding and stayed on the island they’d
probably attract predators W hic|
mightn’t distinguish between them am
the original inhabitants. But the nta
probable outcome would be an invasion
of the mainland and the establishing o
new species that would almost certain!
become pests. Ten miles of ocean isn|
any sort of a barrier to a bird.

“B’long Badu”: The presentation by
a white man of an old crock of a horse
—the only one to come to the island—
to a humble villager wasn’t at all popular
with old Nomoa, who was then head-
man, chief, judge and general Pooh-Bah
on Badu Is., in Torres Strait. He sought
to restore his prestige by buying the
moke, but the owner was willing to meet
him only to the extent of selling a half-
interest. Nomoa clinched on that, but
bided his time till his partner came
before him as a defendant under tribal
legal procedure, under which all fines
awarded became the property of the
judge. Nomoa’s verdict was swift:
“Fined half-a-horse! ”

must have been undecided whether he
was having them on or, arboreally, had
led a very sheltered existence. A premium
of £5 a hundred for red-gum posts is
paid over red-stringy. His final pontifi-
cadon that “gum-tree timber rots quickly
in comparison with other timbers”
ignores that between Croajingalong in
the east and Carnarvon in W.A. grow
a score of “gum” species with ground-
durability exceeding that of jarrah. From
the lemon-scented gums of Ravenhoe to
the blue-gums of Tasmania’s Huon, from
the slaty-gums of the N.S.W. Liverpool
Plains to the yate of Nyumup are got
fence-posts long proved to have an in-
ground serviceability of 70 years. Of all
pale-colored eucalypts the subterranean-
ourability crown goes to Euc. goniocalyx

“Yeno Ham”: After being away from
country districts for some years, I formed
the impression that many of the old
bush sayings were dying out. Then I
engaged an apprentice in my printing
business. The lad had spent a little
more than a year in the N.S.W. back-
country. When we were nearing the
end of a protracted and difficult press-
run, he’d yell, “Won’t be long now.
We’re on the long blow,” But he sur-
prised everyone the day he stepped up
to the old hand - fed Wharfedale and
shouted, “Wool away and jump back,
I hate the smell of a rouseabout.” Those
and other terms may have been strange
in a printing-factory, but they indicated
that the old sayings must still be alive.
THE CHINESE MINERS
A jest bandied around the Victorian
goldfields in the ’eighties and ’nine-
ties was that “a Chinaman could make a
living where a goat would starve.” This
alluded mostly to his ability to win gold
from what the white miner had thrown
aside.
As an example, Chinese would rent
the concession from mining companies
to treat the tailings from their batteries
—tailings which had already passed
through every process of extraction that
the white man’s metallurgy had at that
time, prior to the use of cyanide, devised.
One of my first teenage jobs was to
help a Chinaman who gave a final treat-
ment to the tailings from the New
Koh-i-noor Mine, Ballarat, before such
tailings, having passed over quicksilver-
wells and plates, over strakes and
blankets, finally flowed away into the
Yarrowee Creek. My employer used
orthodox methods, such as woolly
blankets nailed to frames, which trapped
almost the last particle of free-gold and
pyrites.
Clean-up each night included scrub-
bing these blanket-frames into a big
trough. Then, as a finish, my Chinese
boss would pour into the slurry of sand,
gold, pyrites and water a kero.-tin of
thick soapsuds, which it was my job to
boil. A good stirring brought a thick
scum to the top, which he would skim
off. He would then treat what remained
in the trough with quicksilver.
The purpose of the soapsuds I couldn’t
fathom —until years later, when on Kal-
goorlie’s Golden Mile I became
acquainted with a new “flotation pro-
cess,” discovered in Colorado, where a
washlady, operating on the mine-soiled
garments of miners, noticed how fine
particles of gold mingled with her suds.
Thus came into being the oil-flotation
process, which gave a fresh lease of life
to many seemingly worked-out mines
throughout the .world a process the
Chinese seemingly had known of at least
50 years earlier.

BROKEN HILL TODAY
[From “The Fabulous Hilp’ an official story of the Broken Hill
mines and associated enterprises.]
'T'oday Broken Hill (N.S.W.)
A is the centre of a thriving
industry that extends over three
States with plants a thousand
miles apart. Its lead and zinc
concentrates are railed to Port
Pirie (S.A.), where the mining
companies have built the
world’s greatest lead-smelting
plant. From Port Pirie, re-
fined market lead is sold on
world markets.
Some of the zinc concentrates
go by ship to Risdon in Tas-
mania, to another offspring of
Broken Hill industry which is
now the world’s third-largest
producer of -electrolytic zinc.
The rest of the zinc concen-
trates are shipped to Avon-
mouth, England, where a great
smelting-works established with
the help of Broken Hill capital
and Broken Hill technical skill
supplies the English market.
From 1961 some of the Broken
Hill production will find a
third major outlet at Cockle
Creek, 700 miles to the east,
near Newcastle on the N.S.W.
coast. There a new zinc-
smelter is being built for the
production of both zinc and
lead by a revolutionary new
process developed at Avon-
mouth.
Four great companies operate
the Broken Hill mines today.
The leases to the north of the
old original outcrop area are
being worked by “The North
Mine” (North Broken Hill,
Ltd.), which is almost as old
as Broken Hill itself. The leases
adjoining the original workings
on the south are mined by “The
South Mine” (Broken Hill
South, Ltd.),
Further down the line of
lode to the south is “The Zinc,”
operated by The Zinc Corpora-
tion, Ltd. Adjoining it, and
under the same management, is
New Broken Hill Consolidated,
Ltd.), at the extreme southern
end. Both are members of the
Consolidated Zinc group of
companies.
The original Broken Hill
Proprietary Company is no
longer associated with the field
either financially or operation-
ally. It has turned its attention
to steel, shipbuilding and a
hundred other projects of
national importance.
Formed by the first syndicate,
B.H.P. was amazingly
successful and extracted from
its three leases in the centre
of the field 1,456,000 tons
of lead, 624,000 tons of
zinc, 190,082,0000 z. of silver,
102,8570 z. of gold and other
minerals valued at £160,000,000.
Its last link with Broken Hill
was severed when the big mine
closed in 1939 and the Broken
Hill Proprietary Co., colossus
of Australian steel, now has no
direct connection with Broken
Hill except the name it has
taken with it to Newcastle,
Port Kembla, Why alia, Yampi
Sound, Kwinana and else-
where.
The four present mining
companies of Broken Hill,
however, also have played a
decisive role in the establish-
ment of new industries in Aus-
tralia. The experience and re-
sources gained in more than 50
years of successful enterprise
at Broken Hill have enabled
them, individually or collec-
tively, to contribute their know-
ledge and capital to new pro-
jects necessitated by Australia’s
development.
Just before the outbreak of
World War II the establishment
of an Australian domestic air-
craft industry was vital to our
survival and it was the Broken
Hill mining companies which
supplied much of the capital
for the formation of Common-
wealth Aircraft Corporation at
Fishermen’s Bend, Victoria.
Similarly, the mines con.
tributed substantially to th
formation of Associated p u i!
and Paper Mills, Ltd., J
has built the great paper-mills
at Burnie, Tasmania. The same
mining companies have been
large original shareholders jg
such enterprises as Metal
Manufactures, Ltd., Austral
Bronze Co. Pty., Ltd, aD j
Commonwealth Steel Co, Ltd
This wider creative role
however, goes back to the
period of the first World War
and the years following. Apart
from developing the Port Pi r j e
lead-smelting works follow®
acquisition in 1915—and tie
setting up of the Risdon electro-
lytic-zinc plant in that same
period—the Broken Hill mining
companies had a major hand
in establishing copper-refining
facilities at Port Kembla (Elec
trolytic Refining and Smelting
Co. of Australia) as well as
important non-ferrous fabricat-
ing facilities nearby. Later they
were associated with the incep-
tion in Sydney of a very large
lead, paint and varnish factory
Ttself originally sponsored!))
A companies operating at
Broken Hill, Electrolytic Zinc
Company of Australasia, Ltd,
like North Broken Hill, Ltd,
and Broken Hill South, Ltd,
has helped to form and provide
finance for other well-known
Australian companies, notably
Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills, Ltd., Australian Fertili-
zers, Ltd., Commonwealth Air-
craft Corporation Pty., Com;
monwealth Steel Co., and Metal
Manufactures, Ltd.
North Broken Hill and
Broken Hill South have con-
tinued to maintain significant
financial interests in many of
these Australian industrial
which, together with the ZW
Corporation, they did so mud
to create.
On the other hand the Zim
Corporation and its offshoot
New Broken Hill Consolidated
have become linked with other
wider activities through then
association with the far-fluJ!
Consolidated Zinc group
companies, not only in An*
tralia but in the U.K. aDii
Canada.
Apart from its joint associ*
tion with North Broken H'
and Broken Hill South in P® l

B ro ken Hill Consolidated at
Broken Hill for zinc-concen-
U The present Consolidated
Zinc parent company came into
being ten years ago as a final
integration between mining
operations in Broken Hill and
smelting facilities in the United
Kingdom. Since then these
activities have been increasingly
diversified. In the United King-
dom this has led to new fields
of metallurgy (including beryl-
lium) as well as pigments and
a growing interest in chemicals.
In Australia, the group has
extended beyond the Broken
Hill area.
On Stradbroke Island in
Queensland, for instance, it
is one of the major Australian
producers of rutile and zircon
from coastal beach sands. In
the Northern Territory, the
Rum lungle uranium-mining
project is managed on behalf
of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment. On Cape York, in the
far north of Queensland, Con-
solidated Zinc, in association
with British Aluminium, is
developing at Weipa what is
certainly one of the world’s
major deposits of bauxite.
Combined with such pos-
sible sources of power as Blair
Athol coal in Central Queens-
land, the untapped river-
systems of Papua or even the
hydroelectric potential of New
Zealand’s South Island, there
are fine prospects for a new
integrated aluminum industry.
And the new Cockle Creek
(N.S.W.) zinc-smelter is yet
another extension of Consoli-
dated Zinc’s activities in Aus-
tralia. Using the new Imperial
Smelting process developed at
Avonmouth, this smelter will
raw on lh e Zinc Corporation
and New Broken Hill Consoli-
dated mines at Broken Hill for
its concentrate materials. At
e same time the sulphur con-
in • °, f „ the minerals will be
utilised for sulphuric acid and
tertiliser production.
Jj r t h a P ? Broken Hill’s
fii a St - ac ( lleve ment is to be

co-onJ’ the assistance of
sponsorplfk housing-societies
Panies d by the mmmg com-
’ a Ver y large number of
mine employees now own their
own modern, comfortable
homes. Labor turnover is low.
Though the work-force is
strongly unionised, collective
bargaining at round- table
conferences between employers
and employees has solved in-
dustrial problems without a
serious stoppage of work since
1920. Industrial agreements
covering conditions in the in-
dustry are negotiated in this
way and run for three years.
HThe Barrier Industrial Coun-
cil represents the unions and
the Mining Managers’ Associa-
tion represents the companies
in these negotiations. It is a
matter of great pride that
both the spirit and the letter
of these agreements is scrupu-
lously observed by all parties.
To Australians, one of the
unique features of life in
Broken Hill is a “prosperity
bonus” based on the price of
lead which every adult in the
industry receives in addition to
his basic remuneration. When
the price of lead has been high,
the bonus alone has exceeded
the basic wage in other parts of
Australia and it is generally
acknowledged that the Broken
Hill workers are among the
best-paid in the Common-
wealth.
So the great line of lode con
tinues to pour out its wealth for
the benefit of mankind. After
seventy-five years, it shows no
sign of being exhausted and
neither the northern nor
southern limits of its riches
have been reached. Estimated
reserves are enough to keep the
mines busy for half-a-century
at the present rate of extraction.
By then, with scientific pros-
pecting proceeding constantly,
who knows what new deposits
will have been discovered in
“The Fabulous Hill”?
Prospects for Shares
A lower price for wool at a
time when costs are up
decisively is ceasing to be an
abstract problem for Austra-
lians. A pinch is evident in
various parts of the economy.
Now further rises in wages
have taken place, and there is
still pressure for more margins
and for more holidays. In some
industries five weeks’ holidays
are now the rule.

on overseas exports, and now
freights are to go up p.c.
on imports.
The pressure on costs is the
most severe for several years.
But there is now much more
competition in most export in-
dustries (with a notable excep-
tion here and there, more par-
ticularly beef) and ihcreasing
output by domestic industries.
In some cases higher produc-
tion has allowed increased costs
to be absorbed, but hopes of
greater profit-earning from the
increased capital-outlay have
been frustrated.
The sharemarket has recently
tended to take more note of
these adverse factors than
hitherto. It was high time it
did. There has been an ex-
uberance in the market for
more than a year that had
assumed the nature of gambling
rather than investment.
In their published accounts
for 1959-60 we shall soon see
how various manufacturing-
companies have been able to
absorb increasing costs and at
the same time face greater
competition from overseas im-
ports. Figures for the past
year, shortly- becoming avail-
able, will not show a true
average picture, however, as the
first half of the financial year
was barely affected by either
increased wages or greater over-
seas competition. The biggest
difficulties are arising now.
Against these current manu-
facturing and trading prob-
lems there is the long-term out-
look to be considered. This is
bright indeed provided we do
not jeopardise it by damaging
our competitive ability and our
productivity by unbearable in-
dustrial awards. A good deal
of damage has been done over
the past year, We can’t take
too much more of it without
. seriously affecting our pros-
pects.
Purely from the sharemarket
point of view there are likely
to be some fillips to investment
interest by the presentation of
more and more consolidated
accounts as a result of new
company legislation or the
prospect of it.
Some companies have al-
ready promised consolidated
accounts next year regardless
of whether new company legis-
lation is passed or not. In
most cases this should please
shareholders. But there could
be some disappointments.

NEW AUSTRALIAN FILM: "THE PRIZE"
tn this, the first fiction-feature
A of real quality produced in
Australia for years, a boy
learns that the prizes in life
most worth having must be
earned the hard way. In order
to win them one must be
prepared to endure hardship, a
certain amount of risk and
suffering; outside assistance
invariably proves of little real
use and is generally unsatisfy;
ing.
The point, which is never
labored but emerges naturally
and persuasively as “The
Prize” draws to its end, has a
certain relevance to its creation
by a group of ambitious young
Melbourne men whose every-
day occupations include just
about everything—except film-
making.
These men —director-script-
writer Tim Burstall, producer
Patrick Ryan, cameraman
Gerard Vandenberg, composer
Dorian Le Gallienne, technical-
editor Alan Harkness and about
a dozen others —had to start
from almost less than scratch.
Among other normally
essential prerequisites for film-
making they lacked were ex-
perience, the certainty of a
ready market when the film
was finished (“The Prize” will
do the rounds of the European
film festivals before it is avail-
able for commercial release
locally), any but the most primi-
tive equipment, and a local
film-industry to provide assist-
ance and encouragement.
Above all, they lacked
money. Burstall was forced to
mortgage his house to prevent

are times, for in-
stance, when one element—in
particular Dorian Le Galli-
enne’s otherwise appropriate
and lovely musical score —tends
to overwhelm another, thus up-
setting the film’s never-very-
certain balance.
One could probably riddle
“The Prize” with such critic-
isms, but none ot the shafts
would touch its soul. For it
is palpably real and alive.
In places it is astonishingly
beautiful: the more delicate
and romantic aspects of the
Australian scene can hardly 7
have been so finely captured on
film.
The key characters are all
played by relations or friends
of the director. His son, Tom,
has the leading-role of the boy
who wins a goat at a country-
show hoopla-stall. The goat
is stolen by two other boys
(Dan Burstall and Marcus
Skipper), and the film tells of
Tom’s ultimately successful
attempts to regain it.
There are memorable images
and sequences: Tom’s reaction
when he wins the goat; the
close-up of an expression of
fierce reproof from a goose
following a spirited brawl be-
tween the rival boys ; the track-
ing shot of Lisa Jacka —Tom’s
beautiful girl-companion—run-
ning through long, yellow
grass ; Tom’s rollicking horse-
and-buggy ride with the rab-
biter (Matcham Skipper) who
helps him, without much suc-
cess, in his search for the
stolen goat ; the unforced
(seemingly unrehearsed) gesture
of disapproval by the rabbiter
when Tom hands him his gun
in too brusque a manner ; the
frightening, perhaps a little
overdramatised, rapids sequence
which culminates in Tom being
tipped out of his barrel and
inching his way to safety along
a snag while the swirling water
foams about him . . .
The making of “The Prize”
represents a significant step
forward in the long-awaited
emergence of an indigenous
and serious Australian film-
industry.

“A Man’s Destiny”
Irony deeply colors this
Russian film about a soldier on
the Eastern front during Hit-
ler’s invasion ; and its theme
is the unquenchable human
spirit.
With all but one of his
family bombed to death, the
soldier is captured by the
Germans; privations and ex-
cessive work wreck his health ;
then near war’s end he loses his
last remaining son. When
peace comes he adopts a tiny
waif, one of the human flotsam
left by war s receding tide and,
as it were, walks off into the
sunset, his courage and hope
still undimmed.
Free from any propaganda,
the film is a straightforward—
and admirable account of
war. Sergei Bondarchuk, a
fine actor who is the indestruc-
tible type to the life, carries it
almost singlehanded. The
photography has the muted
shades which Russian film-
makers seem to have made
their own.

“A Sunday Romance”
This one, from Hungaiy,
tells ingenuously the lightweight
story, set in a Hungarian
village in pre-1914 days, of a
journalist who gets into uni-
form every Sunday and cuts
quite a dash with the girls
until he meets the maidservant
of a family whose daughter he
takes out occasionally. Only
the brightness and charm of
the principals, Ivan Darvas and
Margit Bara, stop it from
coming apart at the seams.

Stage and Music
“The Magic Flute”
It is customary for books on
opera to regard “The Magic
Flute” as- beyond criticism —
chiefly, no doubt, because the
music is Mozart at his best.
To one who regards opera as
an intensification of theatre—
as distinct from oratorio and
masque, both of which the
“Flute” resembles—there are
certain grounds for doubting
its superiority. The central
characters, Tamino and
Pamina, rarely come to life in
the way that the comic Papa-
geno - Papagena pair do, and
even the three ladies attendant
on the Queen of the Night have
more flesh and blood to them
than the alleged hero and
heroine, or even their mistress.
Nor has Sarastro, for all his
music “fit to come from the
mouth of God,” much chance
of establishing himself in the
way that, say, Verdi’s great
bass characters do. In fact,
the whole sublimity of the
Temple scenes is seriously chal-
lenged by the fatuous utter-
ances given to its Speakers.
Despite this, there is no doubt
that Stefan Haag’s old produc-
tion for the Trust, currently
revived in Brisbane, remains
one of the best things yet
achieved in opera in this coun-
try. Haag at his best has
genius as a producer, and as
Richard Strauss once said of
Lotte Lehmann, “even the
faults of this artist are more
interesting than the correctness
of others.”
After the monotonous,
central - set - anchored “Rigo-
ietto” of the present season
this dazzling kaleidoscope of
fancies was most welcome.
Haag has obviously studied the
current techniques of Vienna
and Bayreuth (the latter’s “Par-
sifal” peeped through this
“Flute” at times) and has
adapted them to the smaller
stages of this country. Only
such virtuoso production— plus,
of course, glorious singing—
can bridge the absurdities and
pomposities of the “Flute’s”
plot.
In singing there has been a
falling-off since the original
production of a few years back.
Valda Bagnall makes an appeal-
ing Pamina, even if the lighter
Mozart characters are more to

“Look Who’s Here”
The Union Theatre Reper-
tory Company satisfies to the
full the declared aim of its
opening production at the new
Russell Street (Melbourne)
Theatre—to celebrate the occa-
sion with a gay and fresh
ni g h t’s entertainment. To
achieve this the company has
imported from London a hit-
revue written by Ted Hicks,
with additional items contri-
buted by several other writers.
It is easily the slickest and
sharpest revue seen in this city
since the Phillip Street company
left the Comedy earlier this
year, and it provides some
grounds for comparison with
the Sydney show.
In neither do we find the
topicality and torpedoing of
institutions and public figures
that used to be considered the
staple of this kind of'-theatre.
The subject-matter 'of both is
safe, off-beat in a sophisticated
way and, above all, well tried
and tested: skits on opera and
ballet in one, on marriage and
boredom in the other.
None of the U.T.R.C.’s
player s —Dorothy Bradley,
Mary Hardy and Robert Hor-
nery are responsible for the
best work in the show —has
anywhere near the ease and
polish of the Phillip Street
people. But the present revue
profits considerably from the
greater sense of intimacy lent
to it by the smaller theatre and
from revue material that is
generally fresher and more in-
telligent. And George Ogilvie’s
NEW YORK HOLLYWOOD
direction, with its breathless
precision of timing (hardly a
dull moment), suffers little by
comparison with that of his
more-experienced Phillip Street
counterpart, William Orr.
Wendy Pomroy, the show’s
musical director, has provided
the company with some excep-
tionally vital and often drama-
tically effective sounds from the
orchestral pit ; and Anne
Fraser’s sets, etc., play their
usual role with style and imag-
ination.
*l* ❖ ❖
“What Every Woman
Knows”
The sheer simplicity of this
surprisingly fresh 1906 comedy,
which Melb o u r n e’s Little
Theatre has revived for J. M.
Barrie’s centenary year, lies at
the heart of its success.
Barrie apparently saw life
in uncomplicated, black-and-
white terms ; and, while some
of his observations are often
remarkably penetrating, he
always makes sure that virtue
triumphs. Thus his heroine
here comes out on top because
she places simply being good
at the head of her list of neces-
sities. The other characters
are all assessed by the same
scale of values, and each comes
to grief or happiness accord-
ingly.
The heroine, Maggie the
unsophisticated girl whose
brothers marry her off to a
poor, egotistical little Scot
with fierce political ambitions,
and who unobtrusively rescues
his career from the hands of
an empty-headed woman with
a title—is one of Barrie’s most
delightful creations. And if
the play belongs to her, then
this production, by Irene Mit-
chell, belonged to Dawn Kling-
berg, whose performance in the
part was one of infectious
charm and fine intelligence.
William Stevenson, as
Maggie’s husband, also seemed
to this reviewer just right: a
not-too-attractive character, but
one with a supreme conviction
—until the revealing last scene
of reunion—in his own powers.
Perhaps the only blemish in
the production was the some-
what sickly-sweet atmosphere
of this last scene, due in part
to John Truscoft’s unnecessarily
pretty-pretty set, some wildly
overstated acting and, prob-
ably most of all, to Barrie’s
overwriting of it.
Anouilh in Canberra
The great temptation f or 1
playwright specialising i n c
situations is not so much
pass them off as a joke as”
use the jokes as a cover f
cynicism and despair.
In “The Waltz of the Tores
dors,” Anouilh, brill*-
balancing wit and buffoonen
strips away all the hyp ocrV; 0 crV ;
the illusions, the deceits t
which men and women hr
tried down the ages to make
appear that social convent#
moral codes, even religion'
teaching, have the natural*
in harness. What Anouilh#;
clearly is that in doing so |
torment themselves and tk
torment each other.
The question is: What®
tude should one adopt to it
Here Anouilh runs for cot
Laugh at it, he says, enjoy its
a huge joke, but don’t k
carried away by any hopes ck
( doing anything about it. 1
filth, degradation, -humiliati
and torment are here to stajl
So we end not with the eye t:
pity but with a shrug of tel
shoulder, or a cynical giggle,
Canberra Repertory’s actor
however, excelled themseh
with the wit, the slapstick site
tions and character ■ studies
Anouilh provides. Underl
excellent direction of Ak
Harvey, and with the suggests
set- and costume-designs #
Andre Rannard, the whole
—and especially Douglas Skin
ner, Joan Buckie, Denis Cato
James Hutchins and Jo;
Warren —helped to create tfj
illusion that art is larger tilt
her voice and temperament.
Originally, the late Marjorie
Conley created this role with
breath-taking beauty of voice
and appearance. (The Trust,
and Australian audiences in
general, owe a great debt to
that lovely'singer!) As Tamino,
Ken Neate cut an impressive
figure and was, on opening
night, in better voice than else-
where in the season.
The original Papageno of this
production, Geoff Chard, used
to give a performance of great
charm, with a certain touch of
the “shy bush-boy” about it,
almost as if the birds he
was on the look-out for were
mopokes and cockatoos. (A
good thing, too, this healthy
grafting of traditions.) His
successor in the role, Ronal
Jackson, brings to it all the
polish and comedy of the
authoritative German stage,
and like the world’s greatest
exponent of the part, Erich
Kunz, does not permit his
clowning to extend to the
musical values of the role.
Rosalind Keene’s Papagena
was so pretty of voice and
figure that one felt happy for
Papageno that his desperate
prayers for “a maiden or a
wife” had been answered so to
the full.
Glenda Raymond’s “Queen
of the Night” had enough
coloratura dash for the role,
lacking only the other in-,
gredient, vitriol; but her
failure there puts her in a
world-wide company of inter-
preters of this undetermined
character.

“The Party”
The pivotal character of this
latest Sydney Genesians pro-
duction is a “weak” father ; a
man whose gay and affectionate
nature is distorted by sudden
and humiliating losses of his
hold on reality. Capable of
helping and sustaining others
if he feels they need him, but
capable also of stultifying seif-
pity and destructiveness if he
feels they do not, he desperately
needs the sort of love only his
adolescent daughter can give.
He has shamed the daughter
so often, however, that now
she can only build walls be-
tween him and her own fierce
idealism. And his wife, who
has propped him up for years,
seems at last to be isolated
between love of husband and
love of daughter.
Playwright Jane Arden has
skilfully arranged these and
other conflicting inadequacies
into a set of deeply moving,
sometimes almost wounding,
scenes. Her calculations with
conveniently delayed entries
and exits, overheard conversa-
tions, etc., might be a shade
too obvious at times ; her end-
ing might be thought too tidy
to convince ; but she must be
applauded for handling such a
theme in thoroughly human
terms and without recourse to
the sensational or the coldly
clinical.
The acting in Evelyn Wood’s
well-pointed production com-
pels response—particularly that
of Marlene Horsell, as the
daughter ; Gaynor Mitchell, as
the mother; and Kathteen
Scott, as the effusive, clanger-
dropping spinster from across
the street (an unfaltering per-
formance, this). Though lack-
ing a temperamental range
equal to the complex role of
the father, James O’Hanlon
managed a study of it with
heart and conviction.
Anouilh in Brisbane
With the Brisbane Twelfth
Ni gh t Theatre production of
‘•The Lark” the usual outcry
bout Anouilh’s plagiarism
from Shaw’s “Saint Joan” was
raised by critics and public
alike. And, as usual, .the charge
W3S misdirected.
Both Shaw and Anouilh went
t 0 the same contemporary
material for their Joans, and
found that some of the recorded
utterances of the warrior-girl
were sheer theatre in their own
right (particularly her retort
about the ability of God to see
His angels were properly clad).
Contrary to most opinion,
present onlooker found
Anouilh’s piece more interest-
ing as theatre than Shaw’s
though Shaw’s is the better
vehicle for an actress.
Shaw, believing that Joan’s
canonisation, not her burning,
was the big event in the story,
brings in a 20th-century scene
to make this point. Anouilh,
telling the story more-or-less
from the point of view of Joan’s
life and mission in its medieval
setting (though not without the
usual French cross-references
to contemporary thought and
politics), has decided that the
coronation of Charles at
Rheims was the significant
event in her life—her fulfil-
ment of the voices—so that his
play ends, like Shaw’s, on a
triumphant note ; the stake dis-
mantled and the coronation
enacted in all its pageantry.

FOUR POEMS
LAST NIGHT
Last night my tough heart cracked his
cage and tumbled
Proud at my feet. “You fiery boy, come
here l
Back behind bars!” Heart pulsed and
grinned, “No fear !”
I slipped on my own fallen blood and
stumbled,
Fell, fainting. Ribs in heartless luxury
grumbled
“Are we that villain’s keeper?” Close
to my ear
Heart rolled and shouted, “Hearts are
trumps, that’s clear!
All’s freedom! Muscle wins. Your
kingdom’s crumbled.”
For dear life’s sake i clutched his pulsing
spite. _
“You’ll never hold me. I’m the bouncing
boy.”
Ar stranger, in the rubble of my pride,
Stooped, fossicking to salvage what she
might.
Heart leapt into her hand. “I’ll keep
this toy.”
I woke. You smiled, your hand upon
my side.
TRISTE, TRISTE
In the space between love and sleep
When heart mourns in its prison
Eyes against shoulder keep
Their blood-black curtains tight.
Body rolls back like a stone, and risen
Spirit walks to Easter light;
Away from its tomb of bone,
Away from the guardian tents
Of eyesight, walking alone
To unbearable light with angelic
Gestures. The fallen instruments
Of its passion lie in the relic
Darkness of sleep and love.
And heart from its prison cries
To the spirit walking above :
“I was with you in agony.
Remember your promise of Paradise,”
And hammers and hammers “Remember
me.”
So the loved other is held
For mortal comfort, and taken,
And the spirit’s light dispelled
As the spirit falls from its dream to the
deep
To harrow heart’s prison so heart may
waken
To peace in the paradise of sleep.
IN THE HALL OF FOSSILS
Three hundred million years:
Out of its temporal home
In five-rayed fin, five-fingered limb,
The hand of man has come.
Under scale or horny skin
Across time’s frontiers went
This bone fan, touching, tapering towards
Man’s perfect instrument,
Taking warm blood for cold,
Feeling the interplay
Of its own fingers with the world
Until man stood to say
“I” with a finger laid
Against his restless heart,
“I’ll shape the kingdom of dumb clay
To order, rightness, art.”
Hands beckoned godhead down,
Cradled and crucified.
Drew heaven and hell in man s own shape
And quick with patience pried
History from shrouding rock.
My young son leans to touch
A clumsy fist of bone across
The notice : DO NOT TOUCH.
MEMORIAL FIGURE
All sculpture’s cut from air.
It is stone haunts the mind.
Nuances of despair
Are cleft and chiselled plain.
Others shall learn my pain
As they walk in the fresh wind.
Air is not infinite,
But is more than enough.
See what the serpent’s wit
Taught us: our tragic joy.
We penetrate, employ
Hollows in stony stuff
To bring horizons home.
Blue flows through frightening rock.
The mind’s a honeycomb
Of “is” and “is not.” Come.
Take stone between your thumb
And finger, feel the shock.
Walk upright, loosen, leaven
Your pain with air’s wild mood
Of freedom. The wide heaven
Is the weight you must bear
When fallen at last you wear
Stone’s calm beatitude.

MISS STRAWBERRY’S HORSE
[From a sequence for children]
Miss Strawberry’s horse bucked out of
his pelt
Then galloped away and lost himself.
There in her yard his lonely skin
Stands and looks uncomfortably thin
Without a horse to fit within.
Miles away the silly horse
Stands and looks uncomfortably worse ;
And who would like to saddle and ride
Upon a horse’s horse inside,
In fear that he may not keep together
But blow away in- windy weather
Making as ugly and worrying sight
As kapok spilled in a pillow-fight ?

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., Ltd.
the 1959-60 wool-selling season ended
I statistically on June 30. Sales recom-
menced immediately in July, the incep-
tion of the new all - round - the - year
auction system sending most prices to
their lowest level in fifteen months. U.K.
and Continental mills, still geared to the
previous auction system, are traditionally
quiet during July and early August—
but the downward drift has derived
added impetus from the recent lifting of
the U.K. bank-rate and from the credit-
squeeze throughout Europe. Fortunately,
Japanese orders are well sustained.
Japan finished up Australia’s No. 1 wool-
customer last season.
The average price of wool, greasy and
mured, in 1959-60, was up 19 p.c. at
51.92 pence.' Sales (up 138,945 bales at
a record 4,929,227 bales) from Australia’s
greatest clip ever (up 190,705 bales at
(925,606 bales), brought in a much im-
proved £359,429,490 (up 21.6 p.c.); still
however, a long way short of the

aligned to profits, to provision for taxa-
tion. The directors claim that “because
depreciation on wool-stores and most
other buildings was not being allowed
for taxation purposes, we are taxed on
more than our true profit.” A little-
changed £376,126 (up £5887) was pro-
vided for depreciation:

The co. has never revalued its con-
servatively stated assets. Net tangible
asset-backing is a solid 40s. 3d. for each
20s. ord. Freeholds (down £72,135 at
£3,538,871) and plant (up £36,259 at
£1,038,780) are in at cost, less deprecia-
tion, suggesting hidden strengths which
could, feasibly, be reharnessed, at least in
part, by extension of co. activities to fields
beyond the present range of business.
Theoretical working capital bulks huge
at £6,388,959 (down £25,819).
Goldsbrough’s C. Y. Syme told share-
holders at the annual meeting in June
that “the results for the year ended
March 31 last have been very good, but
on present conditions it is most unlikely
that they will be equalled in the current
year. In particular,” he went on, “they
will be adversely affected by the lower
carry-forward of wool.” The number of
bales carried over at the end of the year
was 69,608 (against 97,651).
There are few indications as to the
possible course of wool-values at the
commencement of the main selling-
season on August 22, but the close of
the July t selling-period has given some
ground for the belief that the weakness
in the market will be overcome. Mean-
time, G.M.’s fortunes remain cyclical and
altogether dependent on rural products,
the prices and quantities of which are
subject to the vagaries of world markets
and seasonal conditions. The 20s. scrip
seems, taking everything into account,
to be underpriced on ’Change. Shares
changed hands at 325. 6d. last week. In-
vestors who count on an early recovery
in wool prices might consider purchase
at this price. Immediate yield from a
10 p.c. div. is 6.2 p.c.
Edwards Dunlop and Co., Ltd.
/Conservative accounts show further
improvement in earnings and growth
in reserves. The co. continues to expand
at an increasing pace.
Established in 1869 and listed since
1915, Edwards Dunlop and Co., Ltd.,
is a major paper and printing-machinery
merchant and wholesaler of stationery.
Headquarters are in Sydney, with
branches in Melbourne, Brisbane,
Adelaide, Perth and Newcastle (N.S.W.).
Last term’s highlights were the pur-
chase of a majority interest in W. H.
Wassal and Son Pty. (an old-established
paper-merchant operating mainly in
Sydney), the take-over of Parsons and
Hayes Pty. (Sydney printers’ engineers),
and the acquisition of the whole of the
issued capital of Super Transport
(N.S.W.) Pty. (a bulk-storage and
deliveries-transport firm).
The first two transactions involved the
issue of 30,777 20s. ords. and lifted paid
capital to £1,185,000 in 20s. ords. at
balance-date.
Consideration for Super Transport was
37,000 20s. ords. issued after the close

Last June, after ruling-off the books,
Edwards Dunlop bought the N.S.W.
wrapping-paper distributing section of
P. J. Firth, Ltd., for an undisclosed cash
consideration. In addition, the co. made
an agreement to obtain a minority hold-
ing in Paper Products (Holdings) Pty.,
“subject to the present shareholders of
that co. accepting an offer now being
made to them by Reed (Australia) Pty.,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albert E.
Reed and Co., Ltd.” (one of the largest
paper and paper-packaging products
manufacturers in U.K.). “This interest
could prove of considerable importance
if the co. develops as expected.”
Increased demand for paper continued
on world markets. Many mills in
England and Scandinavia report full
order-books for many months ahead.
Prices of some grades of pulp are firm-
ing. Imports into Australia are now
virtually unrestricted.
Despite keen competition from im-
ported papers and boards, demand for
Australian-made products remains firm.
The co. increased its sales of domestic
paper.
Higher turnover in all commodities
handled was achieved last year. Costs
continued to rise. The recent wage-
increases operated only in one quarter
of last term, and their impact is expected
to be greater in the current year.
Gross profit was not disclosed. Parent
net profit for the year ended April 30,
1960, was £14,188 higher at £135,436 after
“all charges and expenses,” including
£31,771 provided for depreciation (up
£3139) and £100,560 for taxation (hither-
to undisclosed):

1960.. 135,436 10 „ „ 117,117 18,319 989,368
This was equivalent to an earning-rate
of almost 11.6 p.c. on the slightly higher
average capital, compared with 10.5 p.c.
in the preceding term, 10.3 p.c. in 1958
and 10.2 p.c. in 1957.
Dividend-rate was steady at 10 p.c.,
absorbing £117,117. Reserves received
£18,319 and were disclosed at £989,368.
The tax-provision indicates somewhat
higher earnings than those disclosed in
the accounts. Edwards Dunlop’s con-
servative treatment of its figures gives
rise to pleasant conjectures of inner
reserves.
Last term, need arose for additional
funds to finance sales of machinery on
terms (one of the co.’s profitable lines
of business). “The opportunity was taken
to co-ordinate all the co.’s borrowings
under the one head.” Accordingly, notes
and debentures were replaced by
£707,146 of debentures. Bank accom-
modation was slightly lower:

Book-values of fixed assets increased.
Stocks were £131,748 higher at £1,110,952
on conservative valuation. Takeovers
lifted investment in subsidiaries by
£50,303 to £194,874. Debtors rose by
£212,069.
The co. is in a good position. A much
better indication of its financial strength
and earning-capacity will be provided by
consolidated accounts promised for this
year. Fluctuations on the world paper-
market, resulting in variations in prices
of pulp and paper, remain one of
Edwards Dunlop’s main headaches.
Another problem is presented by cost-
increases, particularly by wage-hikes.
The co.’s scrip is appreciatively re-
garded on the sharemarket, even if not
very emotionally. It has not been lavish
in its benefits to shareholders, but many
consider this merely to be hope deferred.

Kinnears Ropes (Aust.)> Ltd.
Tn common with the whole of Austra-
lian industry, the co. is experiencing
the dampening effects on profits of ever-
rising labor-costs.
The effect is twofold. Rising wages
depress profit - margins, making steady
growth in turnover essential to survival.
It is imperative to halt increases in labor-
costs, expand output and stimulate addi-
tional demand.
This, in turn, requires a brisk pace of
technological progress. Continuous ex-
pansion and modernisation of plant and
improvements in sales-techniques call for
large capital-outlays and create the need
for additional share-capital and loan-
funds.
. Kinnears' Ropes is currently
going an intensive programme of n i
modernisation. E. H. Kinnear, the”'
chairman, says that “there is ci ear) C 0
place for plant and equipment th,r
not absolutely the latest both j n j
of quality and cost per unit 0 f

. The co - appears to be in a good
tion to finance improvements and ext
sions to its plant. Since Kinnears sha?
were first listed in Melbourne i n 195!
about 50 p.c. of net earnings has L
ploughed-back steadily into business
The 9 p.e. div.-rate paid on the one-ck
capital since 1955 has been comfortably
covered, proving no strain on the co
financial structure.

Last term the value of total sales rose

“In direct contrast with the precedin:

On the other hand, turnover of indot

This was equivalent to an
earning-rate of 17.3 p.c. on the
higher average capital, com-
pared with 21.2 p.c. in the
previous year (or 17.6 p.c. on
present capital), and 15.3 p.c.,
20.7 p.c., 18.5 p.c. and 18.2 p.c.
back to 1955.
The div.-rate was steady at 9
p.c., absorbing £97,523. Re-
serves received £89,604 and
also benefited by £ll6 tax over-
provision.
Early last term Kinnears
Ropes delighted shareholders
by capitalising £180,593 re-
serves and handing-out bonus-
scrip on a one-for-five basis.
This increased the one-class
pa id capital to £1,083,593 in
2,167,187 10s. ords. and left
(he reserves at £432,466, free of

The co.’s ability to maintain
comfortably a steady 9 p.c.
div.-rate on the bonus-enlarged
capital is encouraging.
The balance-sheet leaves a
pleasant impression. Liquidity-
seemed satisfactory. Theoretical

Two new developments could
improve the co.’s earning-
capacity in the long-run. Some
overseas carpet-producing in-
terests have established produc-
tion-units in Australia, con-
centrating on Victoria. Kin-
nears Ropes claims “a very
good share” of the new busi-
ness.
In addition, the subsidiary
Geo. Kinnear and Sons Pty.
recently joined James Miller
and Co. Pty. to buy a flax-mill
at Myrtleford (Vic.).
At present flax-prices are
depressed, mainly through
Soviet dumping policies, but
the co. is interested in building-
up a productive unit ready to
commence output should the
need arise.
Subject, as it is, to the
vagaries of seasonal conditions,
Kinnears Ropes seems to be a
strong co. with good organisa-
tional framework, adequate
reserves and a solid earning-
capacity. It appears capable
of maintaining the present div.-
rate, and capital benefits may
accrue from time to time.
At the last sale in Melbourne
the 10s. ords. changed hands at
245. a unit, for an immediate
yield of 3.8 p.c. on the basis
of the 9 p.c. dividend.

London airmail
From Herbert Holman
-vjo often in the post-war
1 years exhortation by Mint-
ers has indicated the con-
uence of Governmental
L to measure up to events
producing resentment instead
of stimulus. .
Hr Macmillan, it is only
fair to say, is essentially a prac-
lica) man who is not given to
this kind of persuasion. People
are therefore asking what is
behind his appeal to a group
of manufacturers for more and
wider - based exports. His
speech was not just a pep-talk,
since he drew attention to the
Board of Trade services avail-
able and gave his assurance of
Government backing.
The controversial point is
bis argument that there are
many small and medium-sized
firms that could —and should —
profitably extend their business
into overseas markets. Always
ready with a nifty phrase, he
littered one “export-joy”
which is far from the happiest
of bis images. There are many
emotions experienced by the
i dynamic industrialist in the
i coarse of developing his busi-
ness, but joy, especially in
; connection with new and un-
certain markets, is not the most
common.
It is doubtful whether the
smallish manufacturer, how-
ever able, could do much on
Ms own to break into export
markets. Many, of course, are
contributing substantially but
mdirectly by sub-contracting to
™bigconcerns. But one only
needs to glance at some of the
outstanding successes to realise
wfew, if any, of them have
Provided their own resources,
1 j than drive, expertise and
P°f management. Private
J nkers have backed them in
cearly years; larger concerns
e taken them over, though
en leaving them with full

and market-research

Towards Europe?
His exhortation also high-
lights another problem—one
that will be with us for a long
time. Can Britain come to
terms with the Six and find a
way of associating herself more
closely with the Common
Market? For the facts are in-
disputable. There is greater
potential for expansion in
Europe than anywhere else in
the world. If Britain is to
match the economic drive of
Germany, France and Italy, it

association with them.

Market. Others don’t, because
of the inevitable further reduc-
tion in tariffs. The Govern-
ment has its traditional and
valuable associations with the
Commonwealth to safeguard.
Nevertheless, it is hard to
see how, in the long term,
Britain can “stay out” of
Europe and retain her indus-
trial and economic position.
The first Continental share
(Germany’s August Thyssen-
Huette steelworks) to have a
full quotation in London since
the war is reciprocated by the
introduction of 1.C.1. to the
Paris Bourse, where a million
shares were bought and where
it is anticipated that other
British market-leaders will
follow.
The forces are strong, for
British investors want a stake
in the expansion of Europe,
and European investors are
conscious of the comparative
cheapness of U.K. shares.
Crash
“French Without Tears”
was one of the best comedies
of the past 30 years. Gay and
infectious, it ran for over 1000
performances, brought wealth
and confidence to young
Terence Rattigan and helped to
establish such well - known
players as Kay Hammond and
Rex Harrison. With appar-
ently every potential for adap-
tation into a musical comedy,
it was not surprising that a
management as shrewd as
H. M. Tennent, Ltd., sank
£30,000 into the venture, re-
titled “Joie de Vivre.”
After four weeks’ rehearsal
and air encouraging ten weeks’
tryout in the provinces the
affair was taken off, peremp-
torily and ignominiously, after
only four London perform-
ances.
It only remains to record,
with sadness and considerable
sympathy for a cast that obvi-
ously believed in the show,
that, following a succession of
flops, this was the most disas-
trous of them all.
Comparisons are unavoid-
able. Why should “Oliver”
prove an immediate success
and “Joie de Vivre” an im-
mediate failure?, Lionel Bart,
who has adapted “Oliver
Twist,” is a young man who
can neither read nor write a
note of music but has already
earned vast sums of money
through melodies thumped out
with one finger at the piano
in the key of C major.
“Joie de Vivre” was written
by Rattigan (an accomplished
playwright as well as the
original author), had lyrics by
Paul Dehn and music by Robert
Stolz, of “White Horse Inn”
fame. The cast of “Oliver”
contains no big names (the boy
actors are relative amateurs)
while the cast of the other in-
cluded a film-star, a classical
actor and a prominent revue
comedienne.
The answer undoubtedly lies
in the formula; individual
talent, plus freshness. Review
of “Oliver” must be held over
until next “Airmail” but “Joie
de Vivre” was misconceived,
stale and rough. Its mood was
not old enough to be period
and the topical illusions, inter-
polated to bring it up-to-date,
only made it seem the mustier.
The comic Frenchman,
amusing enough in the ’thirties,
was painfully unfunny ; Diana,
the vamp-tease, exerted no
allure in the freer-and-easier
’sixties ; Brian's preoccupation
with wild oats and doubles
entendres became embarrassing
and infuriating; the music,
though pleasant, was tired and
characterless ; and the wise-
cracks seemed laborious. There
were moments, it is true. A
new character, Chi-Chi (left to
the imagination in the original)
stepped right out of the Folies
Bergere to sing two numbers
which stopped the show. But
they didn't belong to it, any-
how.
It would be kindest to say
that “Joie de Vivre’s” failing
was proliferation of effort and
energy. A single original mind,
with a gift of occasion and the
capacity to unify and impart
style, was not evident.
Clash
The American husband-and-
wife team of Jerome Kilty and
Cavada Humphrey have just
finished a short season at the
Criterion and will soon be
leaving for Africa and Aus-
tralia to present “Dear Liar,”
described as “A Comedy of
Letters.” ‘
These are dramatised ex-
cerpts of letters exchanged
over forty years between Ber-
nard Shaw and Mrs. Pat
Campbell. The evening is
thoroughly entertaining and
well-spent. Mr. Kilty has most
skilfully arranged his selection
to achieve dramatic progression
and to bring out the two differ-
ing characters.
The first half is the man’s,
with Mrs. Pat somewhat distant
and overawed, but the second
is the woman’s. And it is the
man, not the woman, who
never stops acting. Shaw is so
busy playing “G. 8.5.” that he
is quite blind to human feelings
and human tragedy. Mrs. Pat,
unlettered, tempestuous and
absurdly proud, is the more
percipient and altogether the
more likeable.
An indication of the univer-
sality of these readings is
evidenced by their popularity
in the United States (Katherine
Cornell and Brian Aherne) and
in Austria, Switzerland and
Germany (Elizabeth Bergner).
They are " also due for a
premiere in Paris next October.

What were the circumstances of
the quarrel between Governor
Denison and Sir John Pedder, first
Chief Justice of Tasmania ? Can
you give a brief biography of
Pedder ?
Sir John Pedder was born in
England in 1784. He was called
to the Bar in 1820, graduated
LL.B. at Cambridge in 1822. He
was appointed Chief Justice ot
Tasmania in 1823, and took-up
office the following year. After a
paralytic seizure in 1854 he retired
and returned to England, where he
died five years later.
Pedder was quick to display
a regard for niceties of Constitu-
tional interpretation, and he refused
to follow Francis Forbes, then
Chief Justice of N.S.W., in grant-
ing trials by civilian juries because
he regarded this as unconstitutional.
In 1825 he was appointed to the
Executive Council and the Legis-
lative Council of the colony when
Tasmania ceased to be an apanage
of N.S.W., and the incompati-
bility of such positions with the
Chief Justiceship annoyed Denison,
especially as in other respects
Pedder was a stickler for con-
formity. In 1848 the Legislative
Council passed an Act under which
dogs were to be taxed. Pedder
ruled it unconstitutional. He
argued that the Council had no
power to impose taxes for other
than local purposes, and the deci-
sion thus invalidated Acts imposing
Customs duties. Denison then con-
tended that Pedder had neglected
his duty because he had not certi-
fied the illegality of the measures
within the normal time of a fort-
night, and tried to suspend him.
The Executive Council refused to
do this, so Denison asked him
to take leave-of-absence until the
dispute was resolved. Pedder
refused, and in the end was upheld
by the Colonial Office.

How to grow Norfolk Island
pines from seed (cones) ?
The cones should be collected
before they break and fall. If a
hothouse is available the seed
should be sown at once, otherwise
cold-stored (dry) at 0° F. till
spring. Spread out so that no
seeds cover each other, cover with
not more than their own thickness
of soil and keep moist. When
fully germinated tube, pot or tin
the seedlings as desired.

In the whole range of opera
no work is better suited to full
recording than this one of
Verdi’s. Composed in his most
refulgent period, and in Italian
opera exceeded in dramatic
and musical inspiration only
by his “Otello,” with which he
astonished the world when he
was 73, it remains one of the
composer’s most melodious, a

though it is nowhere a match
for that of the German, it is
a well-organised work of mod-

orchestra’s purity of intona-

composer when, also under
Bernstein, it played the sym-

The Marxardo
Groucho Marx’s humor is
so essentially his own that it’s
downright staggering to meet
him in a Gilbert and Sullivan
setting, billed as Ko-Ko in
Coronet’s microgroove record-
ing of The Mikado (KLL 1621).
But it’s Groucho all right,
striving valiantly to be Savoy-
ard at the same time. That he
brings this off is a tribute to
Martyn Green, a G. and S.
veteran who has played K,o-Ko
hundreds of times, and who
produced this 50-minute ver-
sion of “The Mikado” for an
American TV-network, cutting
the play down to half-size
while still retaining most of
the songs, the wittiest gags and
enough of the dialogue to tell
the story. Stanley Holloway,
who is always popping up in

Another fine RCA Red Seal

died three years ago, and upon
whose shoulders, on Caruso’s
death, fell his mantle of the
King of Song, is represented
here in arias and in duets (with
de Luca and Pinza), and all
recorded in the period when he
was in his lushest voice —-
between 1926 and 1930, during
his tenure as principal tenor
at the Metropolitan. The selec-
tion is most attractive: duets
from “Boheme,” “Force of
Destiny,” “The Pearl Fishers,”
“La Giaconda,” “Lucia di
Lammermoor,” and “L’Afri-
caine,” the big aria from
“Martha,” serenades by Toselli
and Drigo, and five Neapoli-
tan folksongs.

SYDNEY
The burst of fine spring weather which
came to Sydney during the week as a gift
from Heaven was not really received with
appropriate gratitude. “Uncomfortably
hoi!” said the grouchers. “Most unsea-
sonable.” It certainly was odd to see so
many boys in shirtsleeves and girls in
cotton frocks in July and to hear that
the beaches were crowded. But there was
a high percentage of gloomy types who
warned “next week it’ll be freezing” and
refused to be pleased. How we hate
anything freakish, no matter how
pleasant.

The Camellia Show at Farmer’s Blax-
land Gallery was a thing of beauty and
a joy for three days last week. As Pro-
fessor Waterhouse said at the opening,
it was a show simply for beauty’s sake,
with no prizes, no entrance-fee and no
heart-burnings. Lady Dunrossil opened
the show, and the many present who
were hearing her speak for the first time
were most impressed with the precision
of knowledge that went into her re-
marks. (Lady Dunrossil, when she first
arrived in Australia, told reporters that
she never “potters” in the garden, but
gardens seriously. It is clear that she
doesn’t trifle about speech-making either).
The decor of the Camellia Show,
designed by Paul Jones, was delightful.
A Regency summer-house, its white
columns garlanded with green leaves
and white camellias, was topped with
a pink roof and housed a playing
fountain and a white dove. This
dominated the display, which included
some be a u*t if u 1 arrangements of
camellias. Among those who contri-
buted the most striking arrangements
were Mrs. Philip Simpson, Mrs. Gregory
Blaxland, Mrs. P. Ellis, Mrs. E. G.
Waterhouse, Mrs. D. Coleman and Mrs.
S. C. Du Val. Chairman of the com-
mittee which organised this beautiful
show was Mr. Thomas Parramore.

Shortly Sydney will have to say good-
bye to Mr. and Mrs. F. Henning Hergel,
who have been so popular here for the
past 13 years. Mr. Henning Hergel,
Consul-General for Denmark and Dean
of the consular corps, will return to Den-
mark in September with Mrs. Henning
Hergel, and to entertain and thank
friends in Sydney a Danish evening was
arranged by them at the Great Hall of
the University on Thursday night, when
500 guests heard Danish music, saw folk-
dances and a film showing the daily life
of King Frederik of Denmark, and at
the Union Refectory later sampled
Danish foods at supper. Dr. H. S. Wynd-
ham, Director-General of Education,
thanked Mr. and Mrs. Henning Hergel
for the contribution they had made to
the social and cultural life of Sydney
during their term of office, and expressed
the regret of the guests that it must come
to an end.
Lesley Rowlands, whose book “Why
Can’t the English," has had such a
marked success, was guest-speaker at the
Society of Women Writers during the
week, her subject “Finland.” Her un-
usually interesting information on the
subject had just that personal touch
which brings a travel-talk to life and
stimulates further inquiry on the subject.
Which should be quite satisfactory to
Miss Rowlands, as she is at present
writing a book about Finland which
should be in the hands of the publishers
soon. Her knowledge of the subject
comes from two-years’ experience she
had in that country teaching English to
the employees of a paper-company, and
a further six-months accompanying a
party of 59 Finnish migrants to New
Zealand. The daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
R. G. Rowlands, of Molongulli, Man-
durama (N.S.W. ), she is an honors-
graduate in Arts of Sydney University,
and a member of the staff of the Com-
monwealth Office of Education, where
she deals mainly with Colombo Plan
students.
There was a great gathering of the
Schwinghammers at the Double Bay

Dr. and Mrs. Jim Shannon (who have
been abroad for 12 months while Dr.
Shannon was doing research into coal
for the C.5.1.R.0.) and to farewell Mr.
and Mrs. A. W. Stephens, who will fly
shortly to England and the U.S., where
Mr. Stephens, Director of Secondary
Education in N.S.W., will examine the
educational picture overseas. Mrs. Shan-
non’s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eric
Schwinghammer, and her brother U,
came down from Grafton for the oc
sion, and her sister Zola, Bari
Cribb, was also present. There w -

A mural 210 ft. long depicting street-

tion of superb fabrics from famous
french manufacturers, valued at £20,000.
This is being shown in co-operation with

SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Walter Lindrum
He was not only the greatest
billiards player in the world in
his day ; he was the greatest the
game itself has ever known.
As well as adding incredible-
looking scores to the record-
book, he was at one stage
reckoned to have broken every
record already in it.
These days the game itself is
almost extinct. Over the past
dozen or so years its addresses
have been disappearing one
after another, till now in Syd-
ney, where only a little time
back every other street had its
billiard-saloon, it’s hard to find
a place where you can take
down a cue.
Maybe, in a way, Walter
Lindrum might be said to have
had something to do with that
decline. In him the game
reached its h'ghest possible
peak: he set a standard in it
that could never be matched
again ; there was nowhere fur-
ther for the game to go, or for
anyone to go in it, and nothing
left for it but to fold-up and
quietly go out, leaving only a
few enthusiasts and a few green
tables here and there by way
of historical reminders.
He had for more than half
of his 61 years been called The
Wizard of the Cue, and any-
one who ever saw him play
would agree that Wizard was
more than merely a title.
Watching him in play, he
seemed to have something of
actual wizardry about him.
Maybe for- ordinary run-of-the-
mill players the size of the table
has often seemed about half-an-
acre: good players make it
look about the size of a billiard-
table : Walter Lindrum some-
how made it all so incredibly
easy that while he was running-
up his breaks in thousands it
looked about the size 6f a ping-
pong board.
In the record-books you will
find that he was billiards cham-
pion of the world for 26 years,
as his brother Fred had been
for a decade before him. As a
Melbourne “Herald” writer,-
summed-up in a good obituary
notice of him: “He chalked-up
more than 800 breaks of 1000
or better, including the record
of 4137.”
Walter Lindrum was, in fact,
so supremely good that the
rules of the game itself were
repeatedly altered by its
“authorities,” with the vain
notion of giving champions
some sort of a chance against
him —a notion sprung from the
error of thinking he had merely
perfected a certain few shots
and couldn’t rise above them.
The trouble with those
moves was not only that the
others had to play to the same
rules but that under any rules
Walter Lindrum could have
beaten the best of them, as,
in fact, he did continue to
beat them—so easily that he
had first to give away such
fantastic starts as 8000 and
more to get a game at all
against the world’s next-best,
and finally had to give
away competitive play alto-
gether, because, even under
such seemingly impossible
terms, he could not get a game.
From then on, for about 10
years, he gave his genius—
that’s what it really was —as
a gift to charities of one brand
and another, lifting them in
total into the £ s. d. millionaire
class —not figuratively, but
actually! And for anyone
who missed the fascinating
experience of seeing him play,
perhaps a brief recollection of
one of those same charity
appearances might be enough
to convey some idea of how
extraordinary a wizard he
really was.
The appearance recalled was
staged, in a temporary room
at a Sydney R.A.S. Show. A
smallish, steeply tiered amphi-
theatre, with what he, who
was on the smallish side him-
self, made to look like a very
small green oblong of table
down below in front.
His manager for that charity
performance told the crowded
tiers that “Mr. Lindrum will
now make a break of one-
hundred.” The manager then
rolled the three balls hap-
hazard from his hand onto the
table. They stopped rolling:
Walter Lindrum —small, neat,
in dinner-dress shirt-sleeves —
just stepped to the table and
The cue champion who could
make a 1000 break any time
he wanted to —sketched for
The Bulletin early in his
career by David Low.
literally in a matter of seconds
scored 100 —exactly!
It was so easy that it has
brought another recollection
from a long way back. A two-
table “saloon,” adjunct of a
pub on a Tweed River
(N.S.W.) sugarcane plateau;
home-made * tables of teak,
one of them specially built,
with good wide grooves run-
ning nicely under the cloth
to the pockets, for the
Islands “boys” working about
the plantation—every one of
them, on that table, a happy
Walter Lindrum of Cudgen.
Indeed, from a fair stretch
of lifetime’s interested watch-
ing of just about every pos-
sible kind of sport three
individual performances
remain out on their own: Don

Brian Courtney, second to
Fred Hoysted on the trainers’
list, has his share of worrtes
with the good two-year-old
Golden Acres. This chestnut
has won three races, including
the mile Cooee Handicap at
the Valley on Saturday, but his
record would be a lot better if
Courtney could cure his habit
of hanging badly. He lost at
least two lengths on the turn
into the Valley straight, and
veered so far off-course that he
seemed in danger of striking
the running-rail ; Geoff Lane
had to keep touching him along
the neck with his whip to keep
him on the track. This writer
took a couple of American
friends to the Valley, and one
commented, “That horse just
likes people.”
In winning the first of the
three heats of the Derrimut
Welter (six furlongs less 20
yards) the four-year-old Count

Wool Lad ended a frustrating
run of four consecutive
seconds. A long way back
early, he responded so well to
Purtell’s hard riding this time
that he coasted home lengths
clear —good enough to suggest
he could win at up to at least
a mile. He’s owned by J. P.

A couple of seasons ago Top
Fred was one of the best
sprinters in Melbourne, but
he’d been out of the winning-
list for 12 months before he
won the Sunset Handicap, the
last race of the 1959-60 season.
He found his best form on
Saturday to carry 9.2 to an
impressive win in the heavy
going. It added merit to the
run that Top Fred defeated
Malarno, one of Melbourne’s
best wet-weather gallopers.

With a 21-10 win over Western
Suburbs at Sydney Cricket Ground
last Saturday, and with one more
round to go before the finals, St.
George Rugby Leaguers clinched
the 1960 minor premiership. To
lose the premiership itself St.
George would now have to be
beaten twice in the finals. Canter-

the picture for the final four by
beating Manly, 11; Souths, 13,
just managed to hold out against
Newtown, 12; and Norths, 43, beat

Ampol Sponsorings
Not only the swimmers are
to have the solid working try-
out necessitated by this beins
an out-of-season period for
them. For the same reason
the athletes, too, are to be
given opportunity to get
themselves into something like
fairly representative form
before heading off by charter
flight to Rome.
Original plans—probably more
than could be financed—-were to
have the athletes in Europe tors
month’s training, to put them on
a more equal footing with seasoned
rivals: now they will leave here
on August 18, only the bare week
before the . official opening day
(August 25),
Meanwhile, though, in response |
to a plea by athletics authorities.
Ampol is sponsoring just the right
sort of testing to at least get the
unseasoned team into a bit of*
actual competitive trim—billed as 1
the Ampol Pre-Olympics and due
to be held at Lysaght's Oval, J

All the 17 men and 11 women
Olympic athletes will be competing
against one another and against
unselected leading athletes in the* k

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
THE RB-47
. selection of editorial
A comment on the RB-47
York Times”: “The
Soviet Government’s deliber-
ately provocative action in
shooting-down an American
plane is as dangerous a move
f n t he cold war as its call for
an emergency meeting of the
Security Council is a propa-
gandists one.
“It is not hard to discern
Premier Khrushchev’s motives
in thus again practising the
risky art of brinkmanship. As
he has repeatedy demon-
strated, he is now seizing every
opportunity —and manufactur-
ing some —to undermine
American political prestige in
general and to weaken the
American military position in
particular. His immediate
target is the string of Ameri-
can overseas bases; and his
truculent remarks addressed to
Britain and Norway in con-
nection with the destruction
of the RB-47 are obviously
Mended as a renewal of the
threats to our allies that he
voiced at the time of the U-2
affair.”
The same: “There is no
connection between the U-2
and the RB-47 incidents except
in terms of Communist propa-
ganda. The former involved
a reconnaissance flight through
the heart of Russia, while the
RB-47 was making ‘one of a

London “Spectator”: “The
most reasonable explanation
of this affair is that the RB-47
was shot-down on or just out-
side the 12-mile limit, and
that the Russian pilots had
been briefed that an oppor-
tunity of this kind need not
be missed. The opportunity
would have been easy to take.
Pilots of aircraft on recon-
naissance missions in peace-
time do not normally worry
greatly whether they are 12
or 15 miles offshore. It is
quite possible that the RB-47
was following a routine run —
or at least a routine route —
for aircraft when it was shot-
down. The Russians, after
all, have some explaining of
their own to do. If they shot
it down, why did they go
through the grisly farce of
pretending to help in the
search?”
* * I *
London “Economist”: “As
it happens, the RB-47 seems
to have been engaged on a
mission that has been con-
sidered perfectly legal. If,
indeed, it was concerned to
test Soviet radar and other
activities and dispositions
from outside the 12-mile limit,
this is a practice that Soviet
aircraft, submarines and
trawlers have been frequently
employed on along the British
and American coasts.
“It may be that, had there
been Anglo-American consul-
tation at the highest level, the
flight might still have been
approved on good grounds.
Talks do not solve everything.
But there has been no real
assurance yet that satisfactory
consultations have taken place
over past flights from British
bases, or that the British voice
will be effectively heard in the
future. It is in this situation
that blunders tend to be pro-

vocative, not so much in dis-
rupting the peace—for the
Russians will decide cold-
bloodedly what are provoca-
tions and what are not —but
in damaging the alliance.
“The purpose behind Mr.
Macmillan’s present represen-
tations in Washington is cer-
tainly not to satisfy Mr.
Khrushchev but simply to
ensure that there is no basic
fault in Anglo-American rela-
tions that can be attacked in
this way again. After certain
of the misconstructions put on
Mr. Macmillan’s behavior at
the Summit, it is perhaps
necessary to make this abund-
antly clear now.
“There can be no illusions
about Mr. Khrushchev’s
tactics. He has attempted to
adhere, in the RB-47 incident,
to his dextrous handling of
the U-2, without so far being
able to produce evidence that
the RB-47 in fact transgressed
into Soviet air-space either
deliberately or accidentally.
His appeal to the overloaded
Security Council deserves short
shrift.
“It may be that the affair
has been pressed into service
to bolster the trial of the U-2
pilot, from whom new revela-
tions may be hard to come by.
It may even have been timed
to influence the Democratic-
party convention and, possibly,
[the] House of Commons dis-
cussion on spy-planes
generally. The current Soviet
policy, as Mr. Khrushchev
told the Austrians, is to dis-
credit the United States and
reduce its alliances to ruin.
The British interest in pre-
venting this is entirely self-
evident.”

Manchester “G u ar d i a n”:
“Anglo-American friendship
and American participation in
the defence of Western Europe
are the cornerstones of the
defence policy of the British
Government —and, so far, of
the Labor party also. Long
may it be so. While it is, the
American bases are here to
stay, and the British Govern-
ment and the British people
will rightly ignore Mr. Khrush-
chev’s threats to retaliate with
rockets against bases from
which American aircraft start
on what he may declare to be
espionage flights. If we
[Britain] give ground now,
many other countries in which
the United States maintains
bases, not necessarily for
reconnaissance purposes, will
be tempted to run for cover.

Mildura's Bear
'T'hat Mildura (Vic.) has at
least one claim to world
fame is shown by the follow-
ing letter from the Paris edition
of the New York “Herald
Tribune.” Written by F. G.
Hawkins, it comes all the way
from Casablanca:
“I have just read Stewart Hol-
brook’s article, ‘The Longest
Bar in the World’ (July 4).
“As he rightly points out, the
claim to a longest bar is no
trifling thing, and I fear he may
have blood on his hands.
“While in Australia, I had
occasion to go to Mildura,
in the State of Victoria: there
is there a People’s Club, whose
bar, in the shape of a T, is
claimed to be the longest in
the world.
“I cannot, unfortunately,
remember the exact measure-
ments, but I do remember that
my ‘schooner’ looked mighty
small in comparison.
“Perhaps the Australian Em-
bassy in Paris could give the
size of this symbol of Mildura’s
greatness.”
Africa in the U.N.
Tn a “New York Times”
article Thomas J. Hamilton
sounds a warning on an im-
portant probable consequence
of the emergence of many
newly independent African
States:
“Despite their poverty, the
sheer number of the new
African States will produce
fundamental changes in the
United Nations, where the
Asian-African group already
totals 29 in a membership of
82.
“In the General Assembly
last year it proved impossible,
except on certain special occa-
sions, for the West to obtain
a two-thirds majority for mean-
ingful resolutions on cold-war
issues. On the other hand, a
split developed within the
Asian - African group on
colonial questions, with most
Asians taking a more moderate
line than the Africans, and the
group met several surprising
defeats.
“Largely as a result of the
French decision to grant inde-
pendence to all the African
members of the French Com-
munity, a minimum of 14 new
African States will be admitted
to the United Nations this year
instead of the four originally
expected. This will bring the
African total to 22—more than
either the Latin-American bloc
or the Asian section of the
Asian-African bloc.
“Africa’s representation in
the United Nations will con-
tinue to increase, while the rest
of the world has less than a
handful of potential members,
notably Cyprus and the British
West Indies Federation. By
1965 at the latest Africa, with
30 or more seats out of a
membership that will have risen
to about 105, will need only a
few extra votes to block a reso-
lution by itself.
“It will not be necessary to
wait beyond the autumn session
of the General Assembly to see
Africa’s new voting - strength
in action. Regardless of what
the Asian members think, the
African States are determined
to make a full-dress assault on
Portugal and South Africa, two
remaining representatives of
white rule in Africa.
“There is reason to believe
that, for the most part, the new
States, bearing in mi nd ,
this will be their first apnea
ance th? i„, [
scene, will follow a no „
committal policy on coldJ'
issues.
“The Western Powers are
pinning their hopes on Niger,,
which, with 35,000,000 pe o n| e '
will have the largest
tion of any African State when
it becomes independent
October 1. If Nigeria lives-u
to their hopes, and f 0
what might be called a
neutralist policy, this will
counterbalance the rather anti-
Western neutralism of ofc
newcomers and of two slightly
older and smaller States, Ghana
and Guinea.
The newly independent
members of the French Com-
munity, it is to be expected,
will stand by the West at least
during their early months it
the United Nations. However,
the recent conversion of Liberia
and Ethiopia, once reliable
supporters of the West, it
neutralism and strong ami-
colonialism makes it difficult to
predict the course of Nigeria or
any other prospective African
members.”

Ruih in fflic
Fuiwe
Australia is one of the most favoured countries
on earth. We are reminded of that again when
we look at the catastrophe that came to Chile
this year.
In the mercies of Providence, our country has
been spared the suffering and destruction that is
caused by volcanic activity and earthquakes.
Whatever may have happened in ages past, the
kind fact is that Australia is outside the zone in
which these violent convulsions of Nature occur.
The escape from it has been narrow. Shocks
and eruptions occur in countries close around us.
Our external territory in New Guinea is one of
them. And only a straight separates that from
the mainland.
Indonesia, the Solomons, Fiji, New Zealand,
are near neighbours to whom the latent menace is
known. The Philippines and Japan are subject also
to typhoons and tidal waves that make Australia’s
trppical cyclones, destructive though they sometimes
are, seem small and weak in their fury.
This freedom from the bursting of terrific
natural forces is something for which we can be
very thankful. For an earthquake’s toll in life can
be high, as it was in Chile; and it reduces the work
of years, sometimes of centuries, to ruins in a few
tremulous seconds.
The rebuilding is begun, always in the shadow
of a fear that what has happened before may
happen again.
You see how fortunate we are here in Australia,
how strong the obligation is upon us to earn and
justify our possession of this extraordinarily
favoured continent.
The natural problems that face us are real.
They are chiefly problems of climate and distance.
And there is not one of them that defies a straight
and permanent solution, provided we have the faith
and courage and sense of purpose to press on with
the solving.
A gift of surpassing value has been placed in
our hands. And it is little enough to ask, in tribute,
that our lives shall be dedicated in ardent effort to
proving ourselves worthy of it all.

Britain’s Minister of Defence,
Harold Watkinson : “Our pur-
pose is to provide well-trained,

deterrent to war rests on the
vigor and efficiency of the
totality of our armed forces
and that, in this, the so-called
‘conventional’ forces are as
important to keeping the' peace
as the nuclear deterrent and
its means of delivery. The
way to keep the peace until
disarmament can be secured
is by being prepared to meet
aggression in every way and
through every alliance to which
we are committed.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
“Plevna” Ryan
I found Alec H. Chisholm’s
article on the Ryans, Cottons
and Caseys most interesting,
for, as a gunner in the 53rd
Battery, A.1.F., I had some
slight dealings with “Plevna”
Ryan, or the “Butcher,” as
some of the troops called him
(mostly, I believe, because of
his really uncanny knack of
picking leadswingers).
What is not generally known
is that before entering medical
practice in Australia Sir Charles
Ryan spent two years as a
surgeon in the Turkish Army,
during the Russo-Turkish war
which began in 1877.
Feeling in Britain in those
years was very anti-Russian.
It was only 20 years since the
Crimean War, and hkre was
Russia pushing the Turks
round again, with obvious
designs on Constantinople. So
when young Dr. Ryan, fresh
from Edinburgh Medical
School, read an appeal in the
papers for graduates to serve
in the Turkish Army he saw
two opportunities: to improve
his surgical experience, and
strike a blow at the hated
Russians.
The first blow he himself
suffered —the loss of his side-
whiskers, of which he was in-
tensely proud. The Turks in-
sisted, so off they came.
His next blow was to get
mixed -up with an English
volunteer medico named Black,
always full of assorted liquor,
who invariably emphasised his
opinions by drawing his revol-
ver and shooting holes through
walls, ceilings, or anything else
handy. Fortunately, he was
such a rotten shot that he only
killed one man in the course of
his service with the Turks,
though that wasn’t his fault;
he tried hard enough.
The Turks didn’t know quite
what to do with Black. Un-
willing to risk antagonising
English public opinion by
shipping him home, they
couldn’t afford to keep him
with them, either. So they
enlisted the support of Dr.
Charles Ryan. Backed by a
pocketful of Turkish cash,
Ryan persuaded Black to leave
for Belgrade, whence no more
was heard of him. Ryan then
got on with his work, doing
such a good job for the two
years of war that the Turkish
Government awarded him one
of its highest decorations.
I only met him once, at
Westham (England) camp in
1918. A mob of us were up
for boarding—“Plevna” Ryan
and Colonel Maudsley compris-
ing the said board. When my
turn came “Plevna” shot at me
in that machine-gun voice of
his: “Well, lad, what’s your
complaint?” I replied: “Noth-
ing, so far as I know, sir.”
“Well, what do you want to
do?” “Get back to my cobbers
“And another thing—wipe that silly smirk
off your face!"
in the battery just as soon as I
can.”
That flattened him, but only
for a moment: “Why, nobody
ever wants to go back to
France, do they, Maudsley?”
was his next question. “Now,
lad, be quite honest, and tell
us why?”
“Well, sir,” I said, “one
brother was killed last year, the
other’s been knocked four times
and is finished for good. I’ve
got a bit to square-up with
Fritz!”
That ended the argument.
“C 3 and first boat to Austra-
lia. Do you agree, Maudsley?”
“Yes,” replied Maudsley. “I’ve
boarded his brother three times
myself, and I know the other
lad was killed. I was with his
unit. That family has done
enough.” Exit.
My successor in the .board-
room was a hard-boiled Digger
who had his symptoms and
medical history off pat. We
knew before he went in what
he was going to say. The door
being open, we heard the whole
discussion. “Plevna” opened
with his usual gambit: “What’s
wrong with you, lad?” and was
treated to a lengthy medical
treatise. After a minute or so
he broke in: “We’ve heard
enough, lad. A fortnight in a
nice con. camp, and you’ll be
as fit as a fiddle.” When the
Digger tried to expostulate,
Ryan cut him very short with
“One more word, and you go
back tomorrow, and not in a
fortnight.” That was the
first time I heard him called
the “Butcher.”
I hope that when Lord Casey
writes that book A Hundred
Australian Years he digs-up
some of the colorful incidents
in his father-in-law’s career.
There are plenty of them. I
shall be one of the first to buy
a copy— Sandpatch (N.S.W.).
Lords and Ladies
In accepting “Hattie Hop’s”
mild rebuke for my use of the
Christian-names of Lord and
Lady Casey (B. 20/7/’6O) I
may say that I was not unaware
of how etiquette runs in such
matters, but was feeling a trifle
skittish at the time of writing
Moreover, it isn’t precisely ea f
for any Australian (or possibly
for any Englishman) to discard
a name with which he has W
been familiar. I anticipate
therefore, that every old friend
of Lord Casey—and he has
quite a few, in various coun-
tries —will continue to address
him as “Dick.”
As regards Lady Casey, r m
reminded of the trifling dispute
that once developed around the
title of Lady Franklin, wife of
Tasmania’s Governor during
1837-43. That forthr ght per-
sonality, while quite content to
be the consort of Sir John
liked also to stand on her own
feet, and so she was often
referred to as Lady Jane Frank-
lin. Good old etiquette, how-
ever, demanded a twisting of
this title, and so she was
officially known as Jane, Lady
Franklin. Th a t’s why she
appears in the Australian En-
cyclopaedia under the heading,
“Franklin, Jane, Lady.”—Alec
Chisholm (N.S.W.).
Cooktown
Can't agree with Clem Lack
(B. 20/7/’6O) that the popula-
tion-figure of 40,000 given in
Triumph in the Tropics was
obviously meant to include the
district. On page 385 it is said
quite definitely: “In its golden
age, Cooktown was an opulent
city with a population ofj
40,000.” And on page 202: i
“Cooktown, port and starting-
point for the fabulous Palmer
goldfield, boasted 30,01 r
people; today there are 308 1
inhabitants.”
I did read pages 202 to 201,
and note there that in three j
weeks a city of canvas tents
and slab hufs had sprung up,
housing 5000 people.
When in Cooktown in 19321
stayed with Mrs. Wallace, who
had lived there for over 8
years. I asked her opinion °t

The records did not indicate

Sixty-four licences is fair
enough, even for the whole
district.
I don’t dispute that, for a
short period, the population
may have gone up to 5000 or
even the 8000 quoted by Bal-
Ite. But many moved on,
and the stable population, as
opposed to transients, did not,
I’m convinced, exceed 3500.
Plenty of gold and a com-
prehensive thirst seem insepar-
able, if the experience of other
mining-towns is any criterion.
Besides, in the 1870’s hotels
were cheap to build and easily
run. There were no licensing-
inspectors to demand stated
accommodation for travellers,
and a comparatively small
turnover would ensure an
adequate living.
In fact, all that was really
necessary was a counter, glasses
or mugs, and an adequate
supply of thirst-quencher. In
bulk, both beer and spirits were
very cheap. Licence-fees were
negligible, so it is no wonder
that hotels mushroomed. —•

Aust. Swim Methods
Criticism of the Australian
Olympic swimmers’ training-
?amP at Townsville (Q.) by the
International Organising Com-
mittee and rival countries can
, summarised in one word —
jealousy.
Since Australia reached the
°P of the swimming-world
Dac k in the early ’fifties our
coaches, officials and swimmers
ave been subjected to much
nticism for the methods they
J ay e used to establish world
cords and to win the major

in their own countries. Remark-
ably, the swimmers in these
countries don’t seem able to
maintain the strenuous train-
ing-methods used by our “water
babies.” Where our “kids”
thrive on hard work their rivals
seem to go stale or lose in-
terest.
Swimming in Australia is a
very serious business; the
recent sacking of Olympians
Gergaynia Beckett and Alva
Colquhoun by coach Harry
Gallagher because of a petty
offence is ample proof. It is
because of this stern rule and
the extended Townsville train-
ing-camp that the 1.0. C. con-
siders our approach to the
sport not in keeping with the
ideals of Olympic competition.
This is a poor outlook. It
should be remembered that the
top American and Russian
track- and field-athletes com-
pete and train the whole year
round at home and abroad.
The 1.0. C. should also be
reminded that our swimmers
and athletes finished their com-
petitive season last March
and would be at a serious dis-
advantage if special training-
camps were not used.
Our competitors, although
physically fit, will arrive in
Rome without any real serious
competition for nearly six
months, whereas our main
rivals will be' arriving soon
after completing their seasons.
—Alan Schwab (N.S.W.).

Stonemasons
Fair go, “8.A.K.” (B.
20/7/’6O). I didn’t say that
“there are no stonemasons left
in Australia who are com-
petent to carry-out the work”
necessary to the re-erection of
Sydney’s G.P.O. clock-tower.
Actually, I said it would be diffi-
cult to muster them ; and your
own subsequent remarks sup-
port this statement.
As a matter of fact, I know
two stonemasons at Bronte
(Sydney) who could, if they
would, do such work. But,
like Sydney City Council’s
stonemasons, they are in good
berths of long standing and
would be unlikely to leave
them for temporary work.
Also, with the passing of
these comparatively few trades-
men in stone, I repeat that
stonemasonry real stone-
masonry—will be virtually ex-
tinct in Australia. — Postscript
(N.S.W.).
Cabramurra Postmark
I’ve just received from a tour-
ing party to the Snowy River
Scheme a colored postcard of
the Guthega powerhouse,
posted at Cabramurra. I was
surprised to see that the post-
mark simply bore the name
“Cabramurra” and the date,
with a circular mark similar
to that used by all small post-
offices.
Surely a township with the
highest post-office in the coun-
try, to which thousands of
tourists go each year—and,
incidentally, from which they,
almost to a man, send at least
one postcard—should have an
unusual postmark: something
to give the township the dis-
tinction it deserves.
The Snowy Mountains
Authority is most helpful when
it comes to answering any
inquiry whatever about the
Scheme. Perhaps, in conjunc-
tion with the Tourist Bureau,
it could suggest to the Post-
master-General that he give
some thought to the matter of
a distinctive Cabramurra post-
mark. Since he goes to some
expense to have slogans of all
kinds inserted in post-office
stamping-machines from time
to time, the request would not
be so much out of order as
some may at first think. —
Dune (N.S.W.).
The Health Scheme
I agree with “Im-patient”
(B. 13/7/’6O) that the Federal
Health Department should do
something quickly to dispel the
uncertainty and suspicion
which frequently surround the
dispensing of prescriptions
under the Pharmaceutical
Benefits scheme.
Chemists are now often un-
fairly blamed for cutting-down
the quantities of drugs pre-
scribed by a doctor and refus-
ing to supply repeats which he
has ordered ; but chemists are
bound by the book of instruc-
tions issued by the department,
and they are compelled to study
it closely for their own protec-
tion.
Doctors, often having neither


the time nor the inclination to
familiarise themselves with
these instructions, leave it to
the chemist to correct errors
they might make in quantities
or repeats. Patients sometimes
refuse to accept the chemists
explanation, and he then has
no option but to show them the
list of instructions and explain
that if he dispenses more of
any drug than is set down he
will not be paid for the extra
quantity and could thus incur
a substantial loss.
At first glance the depart-
ment may appear to be saving
money in this way, but in the
long run I’m not so sure. It
has to pay doctor for every
extra visit made by pensioners
holding medical-cards and find-
ing it necessary to keep a
supply of a particular drug
always on hand. The only ones
who benefit from reduction in
the quantities of drugs supplied
and elimination of some repeats
are the doctors, whose incomes
must be substantially increased
by the additional visits patients
are compelled to make.
father than appoint a public-
relations officer, as “Im-
patient” suggests, I think the
department ought to ask an
accountant or actuary or even
an ordinary businessman to
look into its methods. I’m sure
the department would save his
fee many times over. — Peter
Simple (N.S.W.).
When the Commonwealth
Health Benefits Scheme was
“What clown put the ex-jockey on the pneumatic-drill ?”
introduced no one could have
foreseen that by 1960 a married
couple with one child —or with
no child, for that matter —
would be forced to pay 10s. a
week as insurance against ill-
ness. Yet any cover less than
this is inadequate, and it’s
about the amount most
friendly-societies suggest.
Also, it doesn't help the
bloke who’s paying it to know
that the unnecessary visits he’s
paying to doctors are helping
to lift the charge st il further.
He can’t do anything about it;
the system forces him to make
unnecessary demands on it.
He’s not ill, but he knows he
needs glasses, without paying
an optometrist to tell him. So
he has two alternatives. He
can consult an optometrist and
pay his fees ; or he can visit
an eye-specialist and take his
prescription to a spectacle-
maker. He can’t get a rebate
from the optometrist’s account,
so whatever he’s charged is the
amount it costs him ; almost
certainly he won’t pay any
more by having specialist
advice ; and he may feel more
satisfied that way.
But he can’t claim for the
specialist’s charges, either —un-
less he’s been sent to the
specialist by a G.P. So he
goes to a G.P. and complains
of whatever has made him
realise he needs the sn e « ■«.

By ROLLO GILLESPIE
Arranged by the Royal
National Agricultural
and Industrial Associa-
tion and sponsored by
the Shell Co. of Australia and
Shell Chemical, the 1960 jour-
nalists’ tour was the first held
in Queensland. Its aim, like
tours in other States, was to
give representatives of the
press, TV and radio an oppor-
tunity of seeing preparations
for the 1960 Brisbane Exhibi-
tion —this year is the 84th —•
which is being held from
August 11-20,
Tour-managers were Archie
Archer, of Gracemere (hon.
treasurer of the R.N.A. and
councillor in charge of the
sheep-and-wool section) and
Keith Murdoch, Shell’s p.-r.-o.
in Queensland. lan Black, of
Shell Chemical, was assistant-
manager, and Percy Skinner,
R.N.A. councillor in charge
of the horse section and a
member of the arena-com-
mittee, also accompanied the
tour.
The tourists—four ladies
and 21 journalists, cameramen
and announcers from Queens-
land and inter-State newspapers
and networks —assembled in
Brisbane on July 11. We
travelled in an Ansett Pioneer
coach, ably and colorfully
captained by Roy Haines,
whose driving was a matter
of constant admiration and
whose dry humor over the
loudspeaker enlivened the
longest of our stages between
visits. F. J. Kennedy, R.N.A.
secretary, spent the first day
with us.
Saanen Goats
We went first to Marcliff,
Mount Gravatt, seven miles
south of Brisbane, where Cliff
Thorogood and his wife run
a herd of 40 Saanen
bred dairy-goats.
This breed, pure white and
with short hair, originated in
Switzerland, but is now found
throughout Australia.
Marcliff stud, started by the
Thorogoods seven years ago
with one goat, now sells an
average of 60 goats each year
all over the Commonwealth
and in New Guinea. At
present there are 18 milkers
in the herd —it is kept entirely
as a stud or for milk-produc-
tion, since sale of goats’ flesh
is prohibited in Queensland —
and they supply about six
pints each a day for a mini-
mum lactation of 300 days.
Goats’ milk is particularly
good for those suffering from
asthma or stomach-ulcers.

and New Guinea. In addition
he has 350 honey-producing
hives which he moves around
Queensland’s south coast and
the Brisbane hills and which
give more than seven tons of
honey a year.
It was raining when we
arrived at the property, but
Rice had laid-out on the
homestead veranda several
frames, each containing a
queen, and various other
exhibits—miniature nuclei for
mating; an acid-mat for
clearing bees from honey-
combs in sunny weather;
wooden cell-cups; and a
specimen of the giant toad, the
beekeeper’s greatest enemy in
Queensland. Imported to
combat the cane-beetle, this
creature took a liking to bees,

good conversion of food to
flesh and dressing-out well,
this broiler is an extremely
popular meat-type.
At the Wynnum Hatchery
we saw the electric-airflow
incubators and watched two
experts —Miss D. McCullough
and Don Fraser —sexing day-
old chicks. These trained
specialists handle 600 chicks
a day with a maximum error
of one per cent. Then we moved
to the Gislers’ poultry-farm
at Cleveland, where the
capacity of 30,000 birds is
being rapidly expanded. We
had an excellent chicken-lunch
at Cleveland and then walked
about the various poultry-
houses and installations.
Avocados
By now the rain was coming
down hard, and when we
reached H. W. L. White’s
place, Mount Carmel, at Red-
land Bay, we began to under-
stand how the locality got its
name. The property, estab-
lished over 30 years ago by
the late Francis White, father
of H. W. L., on land originally
covered by canefields, is
situated on red, volcanic soil

Dunwich, on North Strad-
broke Island in this chain,
there’s the world’s largest
deposit of rutile. The bay, now
a sanctuary for black swans,
was a wartime seaplane-base.
H. W. L. White has
followed -up his fat h e r’s
original plantings of the
Fuerte strain of avocado-pear,
which is of excellent flavor
and suitable for growth in
Queensland. Most of his trees
are of this strain, though he
has some additional plantings
of the Nabal —rounder in
shape and a later variety.
Rich in digestible oil yet con-
taining neither starch nor
sugar, this delectable fruit
suits diabetics and invalids as
well as those with a normal
digestion. Its pure and very
fine vegetable oil is also a
source for cosmetic oil.
Apart from avocados, White
grows custard-apples, a winter
strain of Meyer lemon, and
tomatoes. By selecting these
profitable varieties and by
means of rotation he has
reduced labor-problems to a
minimum and only employs
three permanent hands.
His new techniques of
tomato - culture consistently
produce 3000 cases to the
acre in each crop. To solve
his water-problems he has con-
structed a retaining-dam on
reclaimed shore-land at the
lowest point on his property
so that water will drain into
it from all sides, ready for

Kalbar and Kengoon
Returning that evening to
Brisbane, we set-out next
morning on the New England
Highway, passing through
Ipswich towards Cunning-
ham's Gap in the Great
Dividing Range.
First stop that day was on
the Showground at Kalbar, in
the rich Fassifern Valley, 52
miles s.-w. of Brisbane. Here
we saw a display of agricul-
tural produce, cookery, sew-
ing and handicrafts prepared
by the Kalbar Junior Farmers’
Club. This club, with 26 young
men and girls as active mem-
bers, has" won many prizes in
district-exhibits at Ipswich
Show—they hold a record of
three wins in succession there
—and have also taken a
“first” and a “third” at
Brisbane Royal.
The scale of points allotted
in judging these district-
exhibits is interesting. Apart
from the merits of the produce
on show, 100 points are given
for general effectiveness of
the design and 50 for captions
and tickets prepared by junior
farmers.
The design we saw included
a centrepiece of the Ipswich
coat -of - arms, made from
colored chaff and surrounded
by produce. This centrepiece
is mainly due to Graham
Rayner, 20-year-old club-
secretary, and took 75 hours
to make.
Members of the club spoke
highly of their organiser,
Neville Dieckmann, and
Robert Yarrow, 19-year-old
club-leader, paid tribute to the
teamwork which has developed
throughout the club and par-
ticularly to the contribution
of the 10 girl-members.
From here we moved to
Kengoon, W. H. King’s 648-
acre cattle-fattening property,
a few miles out of the town.
This property, bought by
the Kings in 1945, has a lovely
homestead overlooking the
wide valley towards Cunning-
ham’s Gap. It takes its name
from a billabong, three miles
long and up to 40ft. deep in
places, which runs through
the property and was called
“Kent’s Lagoon,” after the
original owner. Later this
name was contracted to its
present form.
One of Australia’s foremost
breeders of Hereford and Poll
Hereford herd-bulls, W. H.
King has his principal stud-
property at Torsdale (36,000
acres), near Biloela. Here his
top-sire is Woodlands Saxon,
recently bought from G. W. N.
Bassingthwaite for the Bris-
bane record price of 6000gns.
Having decided that in future
he will auction some of his
cattle at Kengoon, King told
us over morning-tea on the
homestead veranda that he
had lately built a private sale-
ring which would seat 300
people.
Walking round the property,
we had a chance of inspect-
ing the labor-saving Rainline
irrigation-plant, which will

(“answer to a stockman’9

to phis type of horse also
comes from America, where it
was bred from the blood-
horse crossed with the stock-
horse. The breed gets its name
from the fact that it is the
fastest and handiest in the
world over a quarter-mile.
• Hick in the quarters, with a
short, broad back and plenty
of bone, the quarter-horse is
made for weight-carrying and
can stand any amount of hard
work without turning a hair.
Showing us what a quarter-
horse can do, Dick Scotney
put First Quarter through his
paces. First Quarter is, in fact,
a “half-bred quarter-horse,”
being sired by a quarter-horse
from an Australian mare. We
also inspected Vaquero, one
of four pure-bred quarter-
horse stallions imported into
Australia.
Lyndhurst Stud
Three miles from Warwick
on the Condamine River,
E. N. and P. J. Kruger have
their well-known thorough-
bred stud, once the home of
the outstanding Australian
sire The Buzzard, and now
that of Smokey Eyes and
Tudor Monarch. This pro-
perty was our next visit —the
last of the second day.
After looking at these two
important sires—with One
Up and others they are entered
in the stud classes at Brisbane
Royal—and inspecting a pro-
mising lot of foals, we made
our way towards the Kruger
brothers’ imaginative flood-
irrigation project. For this
they use the filtered effluent,
previously wasted, from War-
wick Sewerage Works, which
is gravity-piped under the
river at the rate of three-
million gallons a week to
storage-dams at higher levels.
From these it. can be
released along contour-
channels to irrigate specially
graded paddocks of lucerne
and clover. There are at
present 100 acres under pas-
ture and, by extending the
scheme, the Krugers hope to
run stud Herefords as well as
their thoroughbreds.
The party moved out to
inspect this pasture-develop-
ment scheme seated on a hay-
wagon, but the black-soil
mud lived up to its tradition,
and the tractor pulling the
trailer gave-up the uneven
struggle halfway along the
embankment. So journalists,
cameramen and announcers
(including one lady in high-
heeled shoes) had to plod back
to the coach on foot, with a
load of Darling Downs black
soil on their feet this time.
Warwick
Capital of the southern
Darling Downs, the city of
Warwick lies on the banks of
the Condamine River 100
miles s.-w. of Brisbane. It
was founded as a trading-
centre 110 years ago by
Patrick Leslie, who then
owned Canning Downs.
Lying at the southern entrance
to the rich black-soil plain
which stretches along the
Condamine to Dalby and runs
as far east as the Great
Divide, Warwick is the hub
of a very wealthy district
which produces grain, dairy-
cattle and beef; south of the
city, too, is grown Queens-
land’s best Merino wool.
Besides being a commercial
centre, Warwick has a high
reputation for its educational
establishments —seven second-
ary-schools and six primary-
schools to serve the surround-
ing districts. The city’s
gas-supply is made from
locally-mined coal, and there
is a good water-supply from
the Connolly Dam, which
feeds into four city reservoirs.
An interesting event at
Warwick is the annual rodeo,
introduced in pre-war years by
the present Mayor, Alderman
E. J. Portley.
At Warwick we were enter-
tained to a civic dinner by
Mayor Portley and his coun-
cil and afterwards we were
accorded a civic welcome.
Next morning the coach
took the party on a short tour
of Warwick, during which
they saw the fine Olympic
swimming-pool named after
Mayor Portley, and visited
Canning Downs, the property
of C. E. Barnes, M.H.R., who
had attended the previous
evening’s reception. At Can-
ning Downs the party saw the
famous Dalray, 1952 Mel-
bourne Cup winner and now
at stud here.
The Hermitage Experiment
Station
First call outside Warwick
was made at The Hermitage,
one of Queensland’s five
regional experiment stations.
This station is under the
control of chief experimen-
talist R. B. Bygott and covers
a range of soil-types varying
from the black soil of the
open downs to lighter soils
found among the hills to the
east.
Of the total 432 acres at the
station over 200 are under
crop and 75 are improved-
pasture. Crops tested include
wheat, sorghum, oats, barley,
maize, cotton, linseed, sun-
flower safflower and soy-
beans. There’s a plant-nursery
with more than 200 species of
grasses and legumes, and tests
in feeding and management
of pigs are carried out in the
Canadian Berkshire stud-
piggery. Soil-conservation and
irrigation ; varieties; and the
problem of monoculture as
opposed to rotation —all these
are under constant survey
from R. B. Bygott and his six
sectional specialists, who form
a group of enthusiastic and
alert young scientists.
A.I.S. Stud
At St. Andrews, in the rich
black soil of the Glengallan
Valley, eight miles from War-
wick, M. C. Lester runs an
Australian Illawarra Short-
horn stud and has won 30
prizes in the last few years,
including champion butterfat-
cow of Queensland (his Gem
66) and reserve-champion last
year. This year he has entered
one bull (Tabbagong Beauty’s
Echo) and 11 females, which
we inspected.
Over morning-tea in the
homestead Mark Lester (who’s
a councillor of the A.I.S.
Society) told us that he started
as a member of the R.N.A.
in 1914 and took-up his own
land at Laidley in 1924. He
won his first butterfat prize
in 1931 and moved to St.
Andrews in 1944. The pro-
perty is self-supporting in all
cattle-feeds and is equipped
with modern machinery for

that he'd struck water at 75ft.
from every bore put-down.
In addition he has a spray-
irrigation system drawing
from the creek and supple-
menting his bores with this in
periods of low rainfall. With
black soil 75ft. deep, this fend
is very fertile and, as a result
of careful breeding, it’s not
surprising that Mark Lester
has achieved such good results
and won such a high reputa-
tion for his stud-cattle.
Woodlands
On the way from St.
Andrews we passed, near
Nobby, the property which
“Steele Rudd” (A. H. Davies)
immortalised in On Our
Selection and other stories.
The intersection there is now
called Steele Rudd’s Corner.
Our next stop was at
Woodlands, Greenmount,
where we were the guests of
G. W. N. Bassingthwaite and
his wife for lunch.
Woodlands —3200 acres of
black soil 20- miles from Too-
woomba—was a rundown
sheep property when bought
in 1939 by the late E. E. D.
White, who was recognised
throughout the world as cattle-
breeder and expert in land-
management.
His realistic methods of
improvement were continued
by his son-in-law, George
Bassingthwaite, who took-over
in 1945 on return from J
service. Today this pro| J
is a show-place of the Dal
Downs.
Woodlands can carry ]«

noted particularly what aft

particularly interesting to *
because the Archers, of Grace-
mere, forbears of our ton-
leader, established a Hereford
stud in 1870, which is prof
ably the oldest existing
of any beef-breed in Quest-
land.

Thoroughbreds at Prestbury
We went on to Prestbury,
14 miles from Cambooya,
where C. M. Counsell and his
wife own a thoroughbred stud
and run stud Poll Shorthorn
beef-cattle.
Prestbury is ideal for stud
purposes, having a permanent
spring-fed water-supply and
800 acres of rich river-flats.
The remainder of the total
2400 acres is hilly grazing-
country.
In the thoroughbred stud
are two imported stallions —
Casir, from France, and lungle
King, from England—with 40
brood mares. This stud has
been successful for several
years, with an average of 16
yearlings prepared for sale in
Brisbane each March.
The Poll Shorthorn stud has
been equally successful, and
bulls and cows from the 200
in t.e herd have been con-
sistent winners at Royal
National Shows. This year
the Prestbury team will
consist of 22 beasts.
Once again the moral was
evident scientific feeding
pays. Fodder - conservation,
both for supplementary diet
and as a drought-reserve, is
always practised at Prestbury,
where the present stock of
lucerne-hay is about 20,000
bales.

The buildings, covering 32
acres of the 600-acre property,
include offices and dwelling-
houses, garages, yards and
loading-docks, as well as the
slaughter-houses and packing-
factory.
Fred Keong, who o\vned a
hatchery in Oakey, foresaw
the potential value of increased
meat-exports and has built-up
this business in the last five
years. The original killing-
shed, adequate for his own
butchery, grew slowly until
in 1955 he was employing 20
men. Now he has 180 em-
ployees who handle an annual
purchase, valued at £l| million
“on-the-hoof,” much of which
is sold overseas in the U.K.

After a barbecue-lunch at
Norwin —steaks were provided
by the Oakey abattor —we
were told by A. F. McWilliam,
Laurie Rutledge, Arthur
Watson and Reg Freshney a
great deal about farming in
this area. We also met Steve
Stephens, manager Bob Jack-
son (last year, said Mr.
McWilliam, Bob harvested
1700, acres in eight days, doing
12 acres an hour) and several
Keith Murdoch and Archie Archer —the “Front Men."
other farmers from the neigh-
boring properties.
At harvest-time no fewer
than four headers (two auto-
and two p.-t.-o.) are operated
and they transfer grain to
seven-ton bulk-vehicles, which
discharged it into a pit for
dispersal among four 6000-bag
bulk-sheds by means of an
elevator. Here grain is stored
until the whole crop can be
transferred in bulk to Wheat
Board storage at Norwin rail-
siding, where it awaits consign-
ment to mills or overseas
markets. Bulk-handling cuts-
out costly bags and saves
labor-costs in wages, accom-
modation and cooking. Tho
maximum labor-force em-
ployed at Norwin is 11 (last
year’s harvest averaged 8 or 9),
compared with 20-25 men
who would be needed for
bagging the grain.
From his home-property
near Leyburn, A. F. McWil-
liam sends about 1500 shorn
Merinos to fatten at Norwin
on 150 acres of oats-and 100
acres of turnips. This year
he has 1300 wethers and
poddy-lambs there, as well as
47 head of Herefords.
Landrace Pigs
We moved from Norwin
back towards Toowoomba,
tuming-olf the road s.-e. of
Oakey to visit Glenroy Stud
Piggery.
Owned by Messrs. W. F.
Kajewski and Son, and
managed by Cliff Kajewski
(who is president of the
Queensland Landrace Pig-
breeders’ Association), this
stud was founded in 1932 and
was originally a Tamworth
stud, winning many Show
honors —8 trophies, 11 cham-
pionships, 11 reserve-
championships and 48 “firsts”
—before being sold last year.
It has now been replaced with
a Landrace stud, which was
begun with six pure-bred sows
and a boar of imported blood.
Principal features of the
Landrace breed are big hams
and increased length of body.
Quick growth and economy
of feed make the breed
popular. (Cliff Kajewski told
us that there were only 14
entries in the Landrace-pig
class at Brisbane Royal last
year, while there are 248 this
year.) At Glenroy, fast-
growing weaners have weighed
451 b. to 551 b. at eight weeks

wheatmeal, lime, salt and
minerals, which is machine-
mixed on the property. The
Kajewskis also run a herd of
100 pure-bred A.I.S. cattle.
At afternoon-tea in the
homestead we learned that Mr.
Kajewski, sen., who is a coun-
cillor of the R.N.A., was cele-
brating his 70th birthday, and
were able to offer him our
birthday-wishes with acclama-
tion.
We returned to
where we were the guests of
the mayor, Alderman J.
McCafferty, and council at a
civic-dinner in Lennons Hotel.
It was a very bright, evening.
Gatton: C.5.1.R.0. and
College
Next morning we set-off
from Toowoomba on the last
day of the tour, which started
at Gatton, where we were
joined by Douglas Wadley,
vice-president of the R.N.A.
and chairman of various com-
mittees, and other men from
the R.N.A. and the Shell Co.
W. P. Kemp, of Airwork
Company Pty., Ltd., Archer-
field, met us and gave us a
short talk about the use of
aircraft in agriculture. With
13 years’ experience in this
branch of agriculture, he is
now recognised as a world-
authority and believes that
every agricultural college in
Australia should have its own
airstrip and plane for research
and development of agricul-
tural aviation.
At present operating two
liquid-applicator and two
solid - applicator
Moth aircraft, W. P.
Kemp has under-
taken a wide series
of projects through-
ou t Queensland:
control of diseases
and pests in the Red-
land Bay area;
tobacco-spraying at
Burdekin, Mareeba
and Dimbulah ; cot-
ton-spraying around
the Callide Valley ;
vegetable - spraying
in the Lockyer Val-
ley ; control of
nagoora - burr at
Quilpie and spraying
of the rice at
Humpty Doo.
Unfortunately
weather conditions
did not permit Mr.
Kemp to demon-
strate, but his short
talk opened-up a
number of new ideas
in our minds.
At the C.5.1.R.0.
establishment at Gat-
ton Dr. E. M. Hut-
ton met us and gave
us a short account of
the research which
is at present going on
there.
This establishment, which
works on an area of land
handed - over to it by the
Queensland Government with-
in the grounds of Gatton Agri-
cultural College, maintains a
well-equipped laboratory and
is carrying-out a 30-acre pas-
ture-experiment to determine
the carrying-capacity and beef-
production to the acre given by
Sorghum Almum. Intensive
study is also being made of the
development of soya - beans,
cowpeas and mung-beans.

Friesian Dairy Cattle
The last visit of the tour
was to Freshfields, the Friesian
dairy stud of S. E. G. Mac-
Donald and his wife at Mar-
burg. Spencer MacDonald was
a Sydney real-estate agent six
years ago and his wife was a
journalist on a Sydney metro-
politan daily. Now the Mac-
Donalds are Queensland’s
leading Friesian stud-breeders.
Selecting 240 acres of first-
class brgalow-scrub land on
the outskirts of Marburg in
1954, MacDonald applied scien-
tific farming methods and took
advice from the State Agricul-
tural Department. He bought
top-quality Friesian catfle from
NSW. and has since estab-
lished a record of success.
The stud holds two Austra-
lian all-breeds milk-production
Wrds, including the achieve-
ment of lljgals. for a twice-
% milking, and seven
Queensland production-records.
; . D addition, for three successive
■ ears McDonald has won the
R.N.A. award for Brisbane
Royal’s leading Friesian ex-
hibitor. He also took first
prize last year in the R.N.A.
pasture-competition and came
second in agricultural crops.
The rainfall round Marburg
is variable, but by taking ad-
vantage of the lie of the land
MacDonald has been able to
build a series of dams holding
15-million gallons for year-
round irrigation of 30 acres of
improved grazing-pasture.
Special hayracks in the waiting-
yard are kept stocked with
lucerne-hay and a high milk-
yield is obtained by feeding
additional concentrates in bail-
troughs. Sufficient feed for the
whole year is assured by con-
serving the 50-acre sorghum-
crop in scattered hillside silo-
pits and suppfementing it by
winter-oats.
After inspecting the property
we were welcomed to after-
noon-tea in the homestead.
Then, after a spirited inter-
lude of speechmaking and
thanks which wound-up this
fascinating and memorable
tour, we climbed into the bus
for our return to Brisbane.
The Challenge of Survival
This tour, organised by the
R.N.A. and sponsored by the
Shell Company and Shell
Chemical, achieved its aim.
Of this there is no doubt,
because already our team has
given the people of Queensland
a description of what they each
saw in the medium and manner
most suitable to their public.
In doing so, as well, we made
a lot of new friends and owe
to all of them farmers,
graziers, civic authorities and
[?] pony Atarff, and Silwan, a dapple-grey, at
Gatton College.
Intense interest in a pig—a Landrace at Glenroy.
others—as well as to the R.N.A.
and the Shell people, thanks
for a wonderful tour, in which
team - spirit and competition
for news-stories vied most en-
tertainingly.
Those are important facts
and need stressing to all
Australia, because the Royal
National Association and the
Royal Societies of other States,
with the help of the Shell
organisation, which picks-up
the check, are doing a national
service in organising and con-
ducting these tours. From the
land, in the last issue, we draw
all our wealth, and on the way
we husband the land will our
success as a nation finally be
judged. We shall forget that
plain truth at our peril.
But the significance of. such
tours goes deeper, and it might
be as well to look below the
surface at what this glimpse of
a small part of one State in
our vast Commonwealth—we
covered just on 450 miles —has
to teach.
The mayor of Warwick,
Alderman E. J. Portley, made
an observation which rings
true. “The challenge of de-
centralisation,” he said, “is not
only that of development,
economic stability and profit.
It is one of survival —the pre-
servation of all we have built,
all we own, our freedom, our
democratic way of life.”
On this tour we were privi-
leged to see what our country-
men have built in a land which
once held no promise to any-
one. We learned how succeed-
ing generations have improved
the heritage left them by their
forbears and we enjoyed the
abundance of our country's
produce.
“Within a day’s flight of our
northern coasts,” continued
Mayor Portley, “lies Asia,
where more than a quarter of
the world’s population lives
without even the basic neces-
sities of life. Asia is now
ambitious and on the march.
“There’s the challenge. It’s
the rapid full-scale develop-
ment of Australia we need
. now, so that we are ready to
meet that challenge and play
our part in the great construc-
tive revolution which Asia
needs and to which Australia
must contribute. The small
towns, virgin land, marginal
country —all must be developed.
So anyone with agricultural,
industrial or commercial skill
and knowledge must seek to
meet this challenge.”
We, having seen what Aus-
tralians have done in the past
and are doing at present, know
that, once the need is recog-
nised, this will not be impos
sible.


White Australia Under Fire
Recent articles in The
Bulletin stressing the
importance of main-
taining the White Aus-
tralia policy—and not merely
taking it for granted—have
brought in a considerable
amount of correspondence.
Some of the letters commend
the articles; some condemn
them. Those which approve
are usually brief —this sort of
thing: “Congratulations and
many thanks for your article,
‘No Asian Quota.’ All I have
shown it to have said it was
splendid.” Or this: “Similar
articles in The Bulletin have
given great satisfaction to me
and no doubt to many others,
it is reassuring to find there
is still a spark of sound, plain
commonsense ' finding its way
into print.”
Correspondents on both
sides of the case are prepared
to quote scripture, and »one
writer, after saying that he
thoroughly endorsed the view
expressed in “Plain English”
(13/7/ ’6O), “the only thing
wrong being that it did not
say half enough,” continued,
Some of these religious people
twist the Gospel around to suit
their own ends. The Lord said,
“Love thy neighbor as thyself,”
but He did not necessarily mean
that ,we should make a camp-mate
out of him . . . The Bible does
not hand-out bouquets to any
person who despises his own birth-
right, and there seems to be a
vast multitude of people in Aus-
tralia who would sell theirs very
cheaply ... I don’t know what
the average Asian himself thinks
about our White Australia policy,
or whether he has designs on the
place or not, but a lot of these
missionary-minded and other types
of people seem to think the average
Australian is nothing but a pack-
horse created for no other purpose
than to carry the troubles of the
outside world on his back. If the
Asians are hungry, let us feed
them, but ... Australia at the
moment seems to be suffering from
a two-way pull. One section is
working day and night identifying
us with the Yanks, and the other
identifying us with South-east
Asia and all the colored races.
Personally, I think it is about time
we identified ourselves a little more
with our own country and our own
people.
The man who wrote that did
not advance any strong argu-
ments in favor of White Aus-
tralia, but he obviously be-
lieves in the right of this
country to determine its own
policy without dictation from
abroad which is precisely
what every new nation in Asia
and Africa is demanding for
itself.
Despite the activities of
U.N. and of the multiplicity
of organisations for interna-
tional co-operation the most
striking political phenomenon
of the past two decades has
been the recrudescence of
strident nationalism. This is
a fact which cannot be denied
or ignored and it is dangerous
folly to think that it can be
countered by gestures of
brotherly love and interna-
tionalism on our part.
Tn between the “fors” and
“againsts” on the White
Australia issue is the halfway
“More toast, DEAR?”
man who isn’t quite sure what
he wants:
I am not altogether in favor of
the so-called White Australia
policy, but I think it should have
been enforced until our own
aborigines were treated like human
beings . . . Your heading “Aus-
tralia for the White Man” is now
completely out of date. The
slogan, or whatever you care to
call it, of White Australia, has
become a misnomer and a farce.
Most opponents of the White
Australia policy will heartily
agree with the sentiments ex-
pressed in this correspondent’s
second sentence, even if they
find it difficult to follow the
logic of his first. But it is
doubtful whether they will
agree with his reason for hold-
ing that view—
because we must now have hun-
dreds of thousands of Southern
Europeans here, many of whom
are anything but white. These
people have different habits and
ideals to ours. If you care to
look-up the records of American
gangsters, you will find that the
majority of them had Latin names.
This would seem to indicate that
many of these people have criminal
tendencies. We have far too many
native Australian criminals, and
there is no need to import foreign
ones.
A rather intemperate view,
but one that is fairly widely
held and which cannot be dis-
posed of by pretending that it
doesn’t exist.
One critic of the policy
agrees with The Bulletin’s
objections to some of the argu-
ments advanced by the Immi-
gration Reform Group in
Control or Colour Bar?, but
asks “Has any 6ne race or type
of people the right to hog a
country for itself?”
The policy may have been
needed 50 years ago and earlier
to control Chinese immigration,
but Asian immigration today would
not present the same problems as
it did then. There is no chance
of a lowering of the living-standard
as some people assert. The only
conceivable danger would be
assimilation, but we have the
example of the Colombo Plan
students living in Australia, ming-
ling freely with the white popu-
lation. I have not yet seen a
good reason why Australia should
be “white.” X admit that the
policy does little harm, as The
Bulletin seems to think, but does
that justify its existence? Are we
to spend our lives content with
something second-rate, knowing
all the while there is something
better around the bend?
This correspondent suggests
that the only problem would
lie in assimilation, and dis-
misses this on the grounds
that Colombo Plan students
mix freely with the white
population. The fact that both
the students and everyone,;,'
whom they mingle are aw!
that their stay here is a 3
porary one makes it absolu j
useless as a basis for asj
hons on the likely succ?
permanent Asian i mmigratlo

What they resent is the implica-
tion that Australia consists of

nate, for the friendship of Asia
will be tremendously important to
tite next generation in Australia.
I challenge The Bulletin to
publish a critical review of Control
m Colour Bar ?
I suggest to the real soft-heads,
those conservatives who oppose a
change, that their lurking color-
prejudice—or is it plain fear? —
is an unworthy emotion, and one
which is not shared by at least
55 per cent, of their compatriots.
There is no reason why a
1 controversy which is based
on conflict over color of skin
sWd degenerate into a com-
petition as to relative softness
of skulls— or even hotness of
heads— but Mr. Cook’s letter
cals for some comment. To
Nn with, The Bulletin
article made no inference as
to the cause of the “Congolese
atrocities”— indeed, they were
« mentioned— so Mr. Cook
'a routing a charge that was
jwer made. What was said
as that there is friction be-
ween blacks and whites—and
tllat is irrefutable.

be fools indeed if we insist on
learning from our own bitter
experience instead of profiting
from the mistakes of others.
Against the “successful
example of Hawaiian assimila-
tion” which he takes as an
appropriate yardstick can be
set a measuring- rod much
nearer home—Fiji, where two
non-white races, almost equal
in numbers, and neither of
them representing conquerors
or ex-conquerors, make no
attempt to conceal their racial
animosities.
Mr. Cook says that “clearly”
the article in B. 13/7/’6O was
directed at Melbourne Univer-
sity s Immigration Reform
Group and goes on to protest
that the group, in its pamphlet
Control or Colour Bar?, did not
advocate “anything like the
existence of a five per cent.
minority, as inferred by your
editorial.” The article was
not directed against the Immi-
gration Reform Group any
more than against any of the
other groups and organisations
and individuals who have in
recent months demanded
abandonment or watering-
down of the White Australia
policy. The reference to a five
per cent, minority had no con-
nection with any specific sug-
gestion made by the group or
anyone else. .
Tn parenthesis Mr. Cook
A asserts his willingness—
and that of many of his friends
—“to marry an Indian or
Chinese wife.” What this has
to do with the general proposi-
tion it is hard to say. Dr.
Franklin, a visiting negro
Professor of History, when
asked on TV for his views on
intermarriage between white
and colored races, replied that
he regarded marriage as a per-
sonal matter between two
people, and that is essentially
true. Does Mr. Cook regard
it as a means of cementing
international relations—some-
thing similar to the mediaeval
attitude towards dynastic
marriages?
The statement is no doubt
intended as evidence of his
broadmindedness on the racial
question. But to an Indian or
a Chinese might it not smack
a little of condescension?
There are doubtless millions of
Indian or Chinese girls who
would view with alarm the
suggestion of marriage to Mr.
Cook, his friends or any white
man. Does Mr. Cook limit
his field of prospective partners
to girls of Chinese or Indian
race? Is he equally willing to
marry a negress or an aborigi-
nal girl?
His attitude on inter-racial
marriage is much more corn-
mendable than that of another
critic of the White Australia
policy. This is Mr. K.
Toombes, chairman of the
Queensland Liberal party’s
policy-committee, who advo-
cates an Asian quota of 10,000
a year and wants Australia to
be part of Asia. “We must not
only be Asians geographically,
but also racially... .We must
breed a race of Eurasians.”
After Mr. Toombes had ex-
“I said , shall I order a rum-and-cloves for you, too ?”
pressed this opinion he was
asked whether he would like
to see his daughter married to
an Asian and he gave this ex-
traordinary answer: “Frankly
and to be perfectly honest I
would not, because I haven’t
the guts to force my daughter
to do that, or to force her to
face the prejudice of any one
of us.”
What Australian father nowa-
days would dream of forcing
his daughter into any marriage?
Mr. Cook issues a challenge
(his italics) to The Bulletin
to publish a critical review of
Control or Colour Bar? It
would be mere repetition to
accept this challenge, as a full-
page review of the pamphlet
was published in B. 6/7/’6O.
In the course of that review
this was said in regard to
friendship between Australia
and its Asian neighbors:
The real test should not be
whether the White Australia policy
is offensive to non-whites, but
whether white Australians are
offensive to non-whites. We should
be judged by how we treat Asians
already living here; by how we
treat non-Europeans who come
here as students or visitors; by
how we behave to non-Europeans
when we meet them abroad.
White Australia is still the
policy of the three major
political parties, and its oppo-
nents will have to produce far
better arguments than have so
far been advanced if they want
to change it.
As a sequel to the review of
Control or Colour Bar ? two
letters relative to subscriptions
came to this office —both from
Victoria. One read, in part :
Since I consider that this policy
is more than misguided, in fact,
evil, I must make nay protest
against it in whatever way I can —
however slight and weak that way
may be. Therefore, I am, as ot
this date, cancelling my subscription
to your publication . . .
The defection of this reader
is regretted. Financially the
blow was softened by the
second note:

THE SINGING MAN
By MENA ABDULLAH AND RAY MATHEW
We were following the
sound of bells when
we heard the sound
of singing. There
was Rashida, and there was
me.
“Who’s that?” I asked.
But she said nothing, just
walked on as if she knew, the
way she always did. And I
followed her, the way I always
did, the youngest, the silliest,
the question-asker. I followed
her until we found the words
. . . O, the days 'o/ the Kerry
dancing, O, the clack of the
wooden shoon.
I followed her until we
found the singe’r, until
he found us, the stranger, the
new face, the shabby man who
was sitting on our hill. He
wanted to know what we
were doing there.
“This is our place,” said
Rashida.
“We live here,” I said. “We
are looking for Yasmin.”
“Would she be another of
you?”
He looked like an Austra-
lian, his face was red, like all
the Australians, but his voice
was different.
“She’s one of our goats.”
I loved telling things; Rashida
stood silent. “She runs away,
and then she gets lost. She’s
only little and she gets fright-
ened. We have to find her
before dark comes. That’s
why we have the bells.”
“Have you seen her?” said
Rashida.
“Well, now.” The man
looked at her. “Could you be
describing her?”
I was ready. “She’s a dear
little goat”
“She’s white.” Rashida was
sensible. “She wears a red
collar.”
“With silver bells and”
“No-o.” The man was
doubtful. “No, I haven’t been
seeing her.”
He must have seen, though,
that I would cry. “I wouldn’t
be worrying,” he said. “Dark’s
nothing at all. And you know
about goats when the night
comes down. Don’t you?”
We were shaking our heads.
“Don’t you ?” He was
amazed at our ignorance.
“They change into birds.
Why all the world knows it!
And they’re off and flying up
in the trees. And they fluff
out their feathers, safe from
harm, warm as a parlor all
night long. And when morn-
ing comes, they’re all of them
turning themselves back into
goata. again, into goats with
bells on.”
He laughed then —at us, or
at the goats with bells on,
while I thought about the
marvellous world of night-
time when all the house was
asleep. But Rashida was
thinking about life.
“How do you know ? Have
you ever seen y them?”
“I’ve read about it! In my
books!” The stranger was
indignant. “Plain as plain!
Look!” He took a book from
a big bag he had been leaning
on and held out a page —
printed!—for us to see.
“But we can’t”
Rashida grabbed my arm,
to stop me talking, and she
nodded her head as though
she could read.
“We have to go home now.”
That was all she said.
We were at the bottom of
the hill, still with the sound
of singing—but with a different
song and with talk from our-
selves—when we heard the
tinkle of bells.
Co it was Yasmin, Rashida
and I who went home
together to tell Father about
the man on our hill who could
sing and could read, and could
tell him all about goats.
“But I know him,” explained
Father. “He is coming to do
our books.”
Uncle Seyed was against
it. “This man,” he said.
“This man! Mr. Johnson was
a good man.”
Mr. Johnson is away’ 1
“I don't care,” said „
Seyed. ‘You always tj
nonsense. I am against?
This man, this man who know;

“I do know his name,” g
Father. He put his chuppt
down on the table, to leave i
hands free. “He is Paddy#

“Paddy-the-Drunk! ”
Uncle Seyed was furious;

him, but be explained veil

“What’s a genie, Mr.
Paddy?” asked Lai.
“Ah, my boy, I hope you
never know,” said Paddy. “It’s
a fearsome - looking black
thing it is. And it keeps
appearing to me and at me, at
my window. Frightening, it
is. And it keeps appearing
at my window, looking in. I
was sitting at my bench, work-
ing away, innocent as a boy,
at your father’s papers and
all, and I looked up and there
it was, black as all hell, com-
plete with turban.”
“What did you do, Mr.
Paddy?’’
“Why, I closed the window.
But, would you believe it,
quicker than whisky it was
round at the other side, peer-
ing and purring at the other
window! ”
“What did you do then?”
asked Rashida.
“I looked it square in the
eyes.” Paddy looked the way
he did when he told us about
Tyrone and the English
Bastards.
“Square in the eyes I looked
it. He looked at us. And
we looked at him. “Square in
the eyes I looked it! And it
disappeared like —magic! ”
‘“Cvil! Vile! White-man’s
stuff! I told you!”
Uncle Seyed was enjoying
dinner. “Do you know what
he is keeping up in the hills,
in second hill, your Paddy-
the-Drunk? Bottles! Bottles
of brandy!”
Ama and Father burst out
laughing.
“It is all very well to
laugh,” said Uncle Seyed. “It
is a serious matter. Muslims
do not have alcohol in their
homes, on their properties.”
“But he is never drunk
here,” Ama said. “He drinks
in the hills because he respects
our beliefs.”
“How,” said Father, “did
you find out that he drinks in
the hills?”
Uncle Seyed looked inno-
cent. “I was just passing by
and I saw him there. He was
sitting on a rock and reading
from some English book,
drinking from a brown-colored
bottle. There were other
bottles there among the
rocks.”
“But there’s no reason why
you should ever go to that
hill.”
“Oh, I just happened to pass
there.” Uncle Seyed looked
more innocent. They laughed
then, Father and Ama. “In
any case,” said Uncle Seyed,
“there are only empty bottles
there now. On my way back
tonight I emptied all the
bottles.”
We told Paddy what Uncle
Seyed had done. “Uncle
Seyed thinks you are up to
no good.”
“Does he, indeed?” said
Paddy. He said nothing else,
but he looked thoughtful.
When we were going, he told
us that he would not be going
up to the hill today. He
thought he had better rest.
He was not feeling well. But
if we wanted to, we could
play near the hut, though we
must not make much noise.
“Are you very sick?” asked
Lai.
“I don’t know,” said Paddy
in a whisper, “that you could
call it sick. It’s only my heart.
The doctor told me, but I
called him a fool, that I had
to take brandy for to make it
well. But there’s no brandy
now, not none in the
world . .
He shrugged his shoulders
and went into the hut.
He may have spoken more
loudly than he meant to
because, just then, Uncle
Seyed was passing.
Actually we saw a lot of
Uncle Seyed that afternoon.
He seemed always to be
coming back to the house,
always to be passing the win-
dow when Paddy’s moanings
and groanings were at their
loudest. At last Uncle Seyed
walked up to the door of the
hut, opened it and demanded
to be told the truth.
“Are you sick?” he said.
Paddy cried out with pain,
worse than before, horribly
enough to make Lai cry.
“I will get the doctor,” said
Uncle Seyed.
“It’s a kindness you're
meaning,” groaned Paddy,
“and thank you for it. But
you'd be doing no help at
all getting me the doctor. It’d
be better surely to be getting
the priest. What could a
doctor be giving me except
brandy and its little warmth.”
And he began to moan again.
Uncle Seyed went straight
to his horse, got on it and rode
away.
“He’s riding to town.”
“Is he, now?” Paddy
sounded stronger, more like
laughing. “I wouldn’t be sur-
prised now if that wicked
genie wouldn’t be buying a
river of brandy to fill all the
bottles that he emptied, and
the man who was owning
them, too.
TS7e were still at the door of
the hut talking to Paddy
who was singing and laughing
on his bed of pain “though it
hurts me, my darlings, but
I’ve got the gay heart.”
He was telling us about
heaven and how its real name
was Ireland and nursing Lai
and calling him Seamus when
Rashida called from the door-
way that someone was coming.
Paddy moaned and fell back
on the bed. Lai began to fan
him as he had been told to
do. Rashida and I rushed to
tuck him in. The four of us,
conspirators, innocent and
guilty together, listened to the
footsteps as they came to the
door.
“There are two people,”
said Rashida.
Paddy groaned.
“To carry the brandy, Mr.
Paddy?” said Lai.
“The doctor?” I said.
Paddy groaned louder than
before.
They came through the
doorway, Uncle Seyed and the
priest. Paddy put his head
under the blanket and gave a
hollow, echoing, terrifying
moan.
“Paddy McCarthy! Just
what do you think you’re
doing! ”
Quick as a sparrow, Paddy
sprang upright in the bed.
“There's nothing wrong
with your reflexes, Paddy
McCarthy.”
“No, it’s the rest of me,”
said Paddy. “I’m dying, I
am, and that black thing
beside you, he could be telling
you the reason why.”
“I know the reason why.
And it's a great shame you
are to all men and the Irish
to be moaning and groaning
loud as ten healthy men like
a great little baby and worry-
ing people, lying like Sheba
with a boy to fan you and
handmaidens to wait on you,
and Mr. Seyed here to ride
on his great wild horse and
bring you more comfort than
Solomon gave Sheba. Mean-
ing me.”
“It wasn’t you I was
wanting.”
“But I'm the one who can
tell you what you’ll be
getting.” Father Harrigan
stopped smiling and began
now to speak in a voice like
thunder of God and the devil,
and of fires so terrible that
all of us Muslims, even Uncle
Seyed, felt at home.
But not Paddy. He kept
trying to interrupt, talking
about jokes, hard work, his
mother, anything that came
into his head. It was no use.
Father Harrigan went on to
the end, made Paddy a devil
and Uncle Seyed a saint.
“And now,” he said, smiling
at us children, “your lady-
mother has been promising me
a curry of chicken. So we’ll

CALL-BOY
By
J. P. CARROLL
Mike, the loco.-shed call-
boy, rode past old
driver Corrigan’s house
for a second time. He
reckoned everything was all
clear, so on the third run he
dismounted and almost tip-toed
to the front door.
Regulations say that if no
one answers the door, the call-
note is to be left on the front-
door step, he recalled.
He only brushed his knuckles
on the door panel: that settled
for the door-knock. Mike was
working to a plan.
Conscience thus satisfied, he
placed the call-note on the
threshold and smartly made for
the gate. But when he was
barely feet away from the
safety of his bike, he froze to
a stand.
“Gawd! She’s beat me
again,” Mike wailed.
And so she had. The Corri-
gan’s front-door was flung open
and, despite Mrs. Corrigan’s
breadth, she had Mike by the
arm and led him back again.
“Fred! Fred! Do look who’s
here,” she shrieked down the
passageway. “It’s that dear
boy, Michael.”
“Bring him in, Maisie. Bring
him in,” replied the benevolent
tones of Ben Corrigan.
Mike was sat down at the
kitchen table.
“The poor boy must be so
tired, Ben.”
“Make him a cuppa tea,
Maisie.”
“Look, I got a lot a calls to
do,” protested Mike grinding
his teeth. “Just had dinner,
too.”
It was no use.
“Have some of these iced
buns, boy,” Ben insisted.
Mike made to get it over and
get out. He grabbed a bun and
wolfed it down. But it only
made them think he was
hungry. They plied him, then,
with buttered scones. And when
his stomach reneged at another
crumb, they fussed over him
and declared he needed some
opening-medicine. Mike got
out of this by a whisker, but
not before Maisie had popped
a chest-lozenge into his mouth
for “the dear boy’s frightful
cough” which Mike knew was
the protestations of his tummy
burdened with the fight of buns
and scones in a mix-up with his
own adequate dinner.
They stood at the front door,
a childless couple, and beamed
at the boy on the bike.
“I’m sure the poor dear was
starving,” sighed Maisie.
“If he was our boy, we’d
feed him,” said Ben.
“Gawd!” swore Mike, and
pedalled like hell.
TTis next call was not marked
by reconnaissance. He
kicked open the gate of driver
Murphy’s. Then he gave full
force to the regulation door-
knock. No answer. He
pounded the door again.
A bedroom window clattered
sharply and the stubbly face
of Joe Murphy exploded:
“Leave the thing under the
door and tell me what it says.”
It was clear that Joe Murphy
was trying to sleep-off a bender.
“Ain’t my place to tell you.
It’s written here, and it’s my
job to deliver it at the door.”
Mike was just as clearly not in
sympathy with Murphy.
“You cheeky young beggar.
I’ll dob you in to the boss.”
“Yair, you bloody old pimp.
Dobbed me last week cause I
called you only in an hour when
your train was running late.
Everyone else don’t want to be
waked up till daylight. But not
you, you old nark, you wanted
the regulation three - hours’
notice.”
“You’ll do as the regula-
tions say,” yelled Joe.
“Orright.” Mike threw the
call-note on the door-step.
“There’s your call; come and
get it. That’s regulations.”
“By cripes! If I get out there,
I’ll thicken yer ear.”
“Just try it, you old fool.”
The window slammed shut
and there was an obvious
rumble from within the
Murphy house.
Mike headed for the gate and
mounted his bike. When he
saw the front-door open he
thumbed his nose and pushed
down hard on the pedals, but
only in time to dodge the boots
of Joe Murphy, who saw that
they might connect better as
missiles now that the idea of
applying them by foot to
Mike’s backside was out of the
question.
A T driver Rogan’s Mike
knocked sedately, then
quickly pressed his ear to the
keyhole. He heard footsteps
and the sound of muffled voices
and the opening of a door.
Then, as he anticipated, Mrs.
Rogan opened the front-door.
“Oh! The call-boy,” She said
it nicely.
Mike grinned in acknow-
ledgement.
“Well, I’m afraid Mr.
Rogan’s not Jiome.” She was
very apologetic.
“Must have just come in.
Darn sure I heard him.” Mike
grinned again. Then, with
cavalier courtesy: “Don’t you
mind, Mrs. Rogan. To save
you the trouble, I’ll nick round
the back and see if he’s about.”
Mike saw the pursing of Mrs.
Rogan’s lips. Undaunted,

“I don’t know,” said Paddy.

Mike blew smoke-rings on
the office window. Then,
through the glass pane, he
caught sight of Joe Murphy
stamping towards the office;
by the look in Murphy’s blazing
eyes, here was to be the
threatened “dob-in.”
Mike backed quietly but
swiftly out of the office.
From his refuge on top of
the tender of a locomotive, he
could see the office. He saw
Joe Murphy gyrating and roar-
ing and waving the call-note in
front of the boss. He saw the
boss tug the shed bell-cord
three times; the code-bell to
summon the call-boy.
But Mike lit another cigar-
ette and watched the office
with an air of innocence. He
saw them waiting for him to
answer the bell. But he was
more patient than they. It was
just a matter of waiting them
out.
He turned over the bright
packet of cigarettes. He knew
that good call-boys were hard
to get.

36 - year - old Merino
ewe, which is still pro-
ducing valuable lambs
and fleece.
At the Orange Free
State Show in 1925
“Nellie,” as the ewe
is known, won second
prize for the best-bred
ewe in the strong-wool
class. Although she
had not lambed for a
few years, at 35 she
had a strong ram lamb,
sired by a German
Merino ram.
Mr. Faure has every
reason to be proud of
“Nellie,” just as
graziers everywhere are
fortunate to have
Elastrator on hand.

will be in the regions where
there is water-power —moun-
tainous regions of high rainfall
—to serve industrial magni-
tude.”
In Tasmania today the latter
part of Darwin’s prophecy is
being fulfilled. The industrial
mission from Tasmania at
present touring Europe has
announced that within the next
six months the island will be
“invaded and assessed by the
representatives of 20 manufac-
turing companies” who may
establish factories or assembly-
plants, using the electric-power
generated by the high-altitude
lakes.
The immediate benefits of
increasing industry will be a
great demand for workers,
attracting a large population to
the State, and more money will
be coming into it. But what
will be the long-term effect?
Here is one example. In
February this year it was an-
nounced that Associated Pulp
and Paper Mills, Ltd., had
bought 150 acres near Wesley
Vale, on the north-west coast
of Tasmania, on which to build
another factory costing more
than £2O million. This is to
produce 25,000 tons of paper
and wood-fibre materials each
year. The co. plans to double
that figure in 20 years.
A Minister of the Tasmanian
Government described this as
the biggest single development
of a secondary industry in Tas-
mania for many years: “It will
transform Latrobe and Devon-
port into thriving industrial
centres based on sound local
economy.”
Words can convince listeners
without their full implication
being understood. What will
be the total effect of this in-
dustry, decentralised in a rich
farming district, and using for
raw material the forests of the
island?
First, there’s the question of
raw material for the
factory. Fairfield Os-
borne states that less
than 2 per cent, of
Australia is forest,
and that 40 per cent,
of its timber-require-
ments are imported
annually. In Tas-
mania we have over
2,000,000 acres of
State-forest reserves.
Of this area only
1,200,000 acres is
commercially pro-
ductive ; the remain-
der is worthless
scrub. And out of
this area three
powerful papermak-
ing companies have
been granted conces-
sions by the Govern-
ment, amounting to
273,000 1 acres. This
leaves only 927,000
acres of forest for
the usual timber-
requirements of the
State.
At the same time as this
announcement of the projected
mill at Wesley Vale came news
that the A.A.P.M. Mills at
Burnie had been developed to
the limit of the timber-resources
of the country behind it. This
is the reason the new mill has
been planned over 30

Slildines, but also the streets

ale land. A modern motor-
way uses about 14 acres a mile ;
road one chain wide uses
eight acres a mile. All this
dds-up. And the land adjoin-
ing the factory-site is rich red
basalt, one of the highest-
producing agricultural soils m
the world.
World- population is to
double itself in the next 70
years, say the experts ; if the
Tasmanian population, boosted
by growing industrialisation,
has a proportional increase
every acre of farmland will be
needed to grow food. After
all, food is the end-product of
farming, but the paper-mills’
end-product is merely smoke
and ash.
Then comes the announce-
ment that land nearby at Port
Sorell has been bought as the
site of homes for the factory-
workers—l3oo houses are to
be built. These will not be on
first-class agricultural land, but
another aspect comes into the
picture—that of scenic beauty.
The valuable Tasmanian
tourist-industry is based on
natural beauty. The land pur-
chased at Port Sorell adjoins
one of the loveliest beaches of
north-western Tasmania —curv-
ing sandy bays sheltered by
booballas and she-oaks growing
to the highwater-mark, with
scarlet lichen - covered rocks
standing out in the turquoise

mneys, and the roofs of a
Rowing town.
The Country Planning Act,
1944, empowering local-
authorities to refuse consent to
the erection of buildings which
may interfere with local ameni-
ties, and the Scenery Preserva-
tion Act, 1915, which takes
care of historical sites, parks
and outdoor advertising, do
not seem able to prevent the
gradual obliteration of natural
beauty by “the march of
progress.”
Again, there is the social

aspect of a large industry, de-
centralised in a farming dis-
trict: its effect on the supply
of farm-labor, the industrial
award-rates, the factory hours
of work and the overtime-pay
of factory-workers, with all of
which farmers will have to
compete.
Finally, there’s the effect of
the factory on wildlife in the
vicinity. Has the smell and
effluvia been studied in relation
to insects and birds? And what
of the waste-products pumped
into the sea and their effects on
marine organisms, and, particu-
larly, on fish?
As far as the A.P.P.M. fae?
tory is concerned, there is a
strong easterly set of current
along the north-west coast, past
Wesley Vale. There is also a
rare colony of fairy-penguins
on Larooma Point, only a few
miles east of the factory-site.
Each year the penguins hatch
their young there. If the fish
move out from the shore, will
the penguins follow their
food - supply forsaking their
breeding - ground of perhaps
thousands of years past, or
will they remain with their
young and starve? This may
seem unimportant, but it is
significant.
Developing the Desert
“Emel”: This year an im-
portant part of the A.M.P.
Society’s huge project will be
completed and will bring into
agricultural use the scrubland
known as the Ninety Mile
Desert in the south-east of
South Australia and across the
Victorian border.
Already, an area totalling a
quarter-million acres in the
Keith-Bordertown (S.A.) dis-
trict has been cleared, ploughed,
seeded, spread with superphos-
phate and trace-elements, and
sold to selected farmers.
Two years ago, after the
South Australian Mines
Department had sunk a hun-
dred bores in an exhaustive
water-test of the region, the
A.M.P. started opening-up the
100,000 acres they held west
of Tintinara (S.A.). A survey
was made to provide roads, and
since then blocks averaging
1500 acres have been ring-
fenced and, in some cases,
logged and ploughed. Already
30 of these blocks have been
sold to district farmers keen to
set-up their sons on the land.
By the end of this year, even
though buyers must complete
the reclamation of the desert
by seeding their land and
spreading superphosphate with
the necessary trace-elements,
the Tintinara development
should be completed.
On the Victorian side, where
the A.M.P. holds a quarter-
million acres north of Lillimur,
a long-range plan has been
initiated by developing 50,000
acres as a preliminary to bring-
ing the whole area under cul-
tivation.

Topsoil in the
Mulga Country
“Gravelsnatcher”: Two pic-
tures from the Kimberleys pub-
lished in a Perth daily provide
the final answer to those who
hold that the loss of a few
inches of topsoil isn’t such a
serious matter.
One picture, -taken at an agri-
cultural-research station, shows
a flourishing stand of cotton ;
the other shows barren earth,
bereft of every sign of vegeta-
tion except a dead mulga with
exposed roots. In those parts
there’s a stretch of barren
country which a few years
ago was well covered, and
it’s only one of many simi-
lar barren stretches in the
mulga country. The Agri-
culture Department is using
contour-ploughing and other
methods of conservation to re-
claim this land, and eventually
they may win ; but the road
back will be long and rugged.
These localised deserts are
the direct result of overstock-
ing. In its natural state mulga
country carries three stories of
vegetation a top - story of
mulga, a middle-story of shrubs
and a ground-story of grasses,
Associations of this nature
exist throughout the plant-
kingdom, and in them each
individual species provides a
service and has a need filled,
Together they constitute a
balance, and it’s together that
they withstand the pressures of
the natural forces characteristic
of the locality.
In the mulga association the
enemy is drought; and each
species, in combating it, assists
and gains help from each of
the others. The mulga provides
shade for the annuals, which
have to start from germination
each season, and to some extent
also for the perennials. The
shrubs shade the ground where
some of the mulga-roots are
not far below the surface, and
the grasses help to bind the soil
beneath and around the trees
and shrubs. Together the mem-
bers of this association have
kept clothed vast areas which
otherwise would be desert, and
have made them capable of
supporting a limited amount of
native stock.
These areas can also carry
a few sheep. The trouble is
that in good years they can
carry a great deal more —and
often they’re asked to. The
sheep have preferences, and
before long the more palatable
grasses and shrubs have been
eaten-out. The association has
been disrupted, some necessary
members have been removed,
and the rest decline. Then it’s
shown that the association
also included animals —native
animals able to move over the
ground without cutting it.
Sheep don’t belong j n
association; their hooves
the ground, which no L
has the root-system to J
it; the dust rises, and the®
takes over.
You might be able to»
that the region is, fundame

ground still holds the neces
nutrients in the same qilat
as before, and it’s still
the same rainfall. All |
missing is that top f ew

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(21/7/’6O)
Queensland is likely to have patchy rain during August,
but with better falls along the coast, on the central high-
lands and the Darling Downs, and about the Maranoa and
Warrego. Light to moderate patchy rains will probably
continue during September and October, with good rains in
a large part of the State during November.
In N.S.W. there should be good rains during August in
the coastal districts and north-western areas, and on the
tablelands, with light to moderate patchy falls elsewhere.
Rainfall is likely to be light in September, and light to
moderate in October.
Victoria will probably have moderate rains, mainly
below normal, during August, with better falls in the east-
central and upper-north-eastern districts and along the west
coast. General rains are likely during September, with light
to moderate falls during October and November.
Rainfall in the agricultural areas of South Australia is
likely to be below average during August, with light rain in
the Murray Valley and poor falls in the interior. There
should be good rains in the agricultural areas and along the
west coast during September.
From light to moderate rainfall can be expected in the
agricultural areas of Western Australia during August. Else-
where falls may be light and patchy, though it is likely to be
mainly dry in the north.

also short at arge areas are
nitrogen. Leav-
ing shortage of trace-elements
out of account and trying
simply to increase phosphate
and nitrogen, as most pasture
in those parts has some clover
in it, first increase that clover
by topdressing or oversowing
clover-seed in with the super,
for at least two seasons. Then
get out a tractor and disk-
harrow or plough and, while
the grass is green before it
seeds, work the land up —
once-over is enough, and just
do 30 or 40 acres each season.
This will have the effect of
burying in the soil much of
the green grass needed to form
humus. This green grass will
form a better-quality humus
than will dried-out (so-called)
grass which waves in the wind.
A good - quality humus
increases the bacteria-count in
the soil and makes available
the plant-foods needed for all
growth and for producing the
proteins necessary for milk,
wool, beef or even the life of
man.
Once phosphate is supplied,
the clovers will increase the
nitrogen-content of the soil —
a much cheaper method than
sowing sulphate-of-ammonia.
Cultivate these pastures every
third year.
In S.A. we have proved the
value of humus in fruit-
growing. With the use of a
tractor and tandem disk-
cultivator, and by turning-in
the cover-crop and keeping the
soil friable, we have encour-
aged bacteria and had an
increased annual return in the
autumn crop of better fruit.
To get resu 11 s from
pasture-land you must put
something in—not just by hit-
or-miss methods, but by
thoughtful planning.
"Heavy Horses"
“Kaex”: “M.F.D.” (B.
6/ 7 / ’6O) could be confused in
his surprise at hearing an
Adelaide A.B.C. speaker refer
to the “heavy horse,” since
technically this means the
Shire.
The term “draught-horse,”
correctly applied, means a type
used for haulage, and there are
(or were, for it is a vanishing
race) three distinct types
of draught - horse: heavy,
medium and light. On British
standards and Australia’s
draught-horses are descended
mainly from stock imported
from the British Isles—the
Shire is the heavy horse, the
Clydesdale the medium-
draught, and the Suffolk
Punch the light-draught.
Again, this group has often
been referred to generally as
“heavy-harness” types, dis-
tinct from “light-harness”
horses like the English
coachers, Cleveland Bays, etc.
The Shire—said to be
descended from the old war-
horse, which carried heavy
protective armor-js an
o l ? m tSc ha P l o ry wt Bged ßur!, m fs
cumbersome and unwieldy,
and in Australia (or at least
in the eastern States) was
used mainly for heavy-haulage
work around the cities and
larger towns—big pulls over
relatively short journeys. I
can remember having, as a
child, seen glorious Shires
pulling brewery-wagons in
Sydney.
The sturdy, lighter-bodied
and cleaner-legged Clydesdale
was the choice of graziers,
farmers and teamsters and
became almost the universal
“draught” in this country,
though the nippier chestnut
Suffolk Punch had many
adherents. Since “M.F.D.” is
a native of the N.S.W. North
Coast, as I also am, he may
remember the progeny of the
great Clydesdale stallions
Clansman and King of the
Oaks which were prized in
that area more than 40 years
back.
j don . t know how much the

Adelaide speaker meant only
ar § er draught-horses he
was wed ou t °f his depth and
should, as M.F.D.” suggests,
h ave referred to “the draught-
horse, nearly all kinds of
which are heavy. What is
usuall Y a crossbred animal
should be termed a half- or
quarter-draught.
Just as there is only one
type of “thoroughbred horse”
•—the English-evolved blood-
horse—so is there only one
“heavy horse”—the Shire—so
far as horses of British origin
are concerned.

Ernest Bevin
Son of a Somerset village widow and
an unknown father, Ernest Bevin, hero
of The Life and Times of Ernest Bevin,
Vol. I, 1881-1940, by Alan Bullock
(Heinemann), began as a farm-laborer,
became a Bristol Socialist and secretary
of the Right-to-Work committee and
in 1909 was defeated in the town-
council elections. He drove a horse and
cart for a living and, dissatisfied with
the unions which might have repre-
sented him, led in the formation of a
carmen’s branch of the Dockers’ Union
at Bristol, of which he became first
chairman.
He advanced to organiser for the
Dockers’ Union; and then, in 1920, to
General Secretary of the Transport and
General Workers’ Union, a huge show
which finally represented about a tenth
of British unionists, mainly because of
Bevin’s ability as an organiser, and
which gave such scope to his talents
that when Churchill was forming his
War Cabinet in 1940 the first name in
the list of four he gave Attlee was
Bevin’s, for the Ministry of Labor.
Bevin’s common complaint about
reporters was that they wrote-up strikes
and ignored successful negotiations, but
patiently and interestingly though his
biographer has followed his brilliant
course as negotiator and organiser, the
more readable parts of this 650-page
half of Bevin’s life are the parts where
he hit the news, first as “The Dockers’
K.C.,” in 1920, when Bevin, who hardly
ever read a book, went into court
against the best counsel money could
buy, put his first-hand knowledge of
dockers’ conditions, without senti-
mentality, against all the evidence the
employers could assemble, and con-
fronted a Cambridge professor with
“the exact amount of bacon, fish and
bread” he considered sufficient break-
fast for a docker.
Next comes the abortive strike of
the “Triple Alliance” (Miners, Rail-
waymen and Transport Workers) of
1921; and the General Strike of 1926,
for which the Government, warned by
the 1921 strike, had prepared itself with
emergency powers. Bullock gi ve ,

not quite liked (he found Detn

down Ramsay MacDonald’s offer of

about Bevin was his reorganisation
1929-30, of the Labor paper “h
Daily Herald.” Odhams held £5ll

Union Council held £49,000. Tie
were four union directors and f

19th-20th JULY
The cold comes sharp on sunset in July
And on the clear glow westward, thinly
brown,
Hearth-smoke rises, as peace to the mind
at evening,
And lies in white drifts through the
darkening valley
And far across the plain. In farm and
town
With scent of she-oak, mallee, cypress-
pine,
Bark flares and flies in air so keen and
dry,
The kindling blazes up, the pure flames
leap;
Children run out to watch their chimney
roll
A fre-flecked cloud along the blue of
twilight
And men bring in more logs, lest the
season’s bite
Find out the marks where other teeth
sank deep.
And in July my father would recall
Summer in France, the harvest of
Fromelles,
Five thousand of our countrymen, mown
down
In one night.
Let it still be night fa
The sun be dark that brought top'
light
The dim shapes of that dawn. I »
see,
I will not glean in those old fields off
My generation has its scars as wd
That break and bleed. (No end, *
no end.
The sin of Cain.)

world, to reach a circulation of two-
’’’ggv'in occasionally wrote for “The
Herald”; he was one °f its best
circulation-boosters. A man of little
education, he got his ideas from other
people in talk and meditation over what
was said. As a member of the Com-
mittee on Finance and Industry he
aFUe d the point with economists like
Keynes and asked questions of the
redoubtable Governor of the Bank of
England. He was distrustful of all
“intellectuals” who got into the Labor
party without having labored, from
Ramsay MacDonald to economists like
Cole and theorists like Cripps. The
respect the Conservatives had for
Bevin’s toughness as a negotiator and
for his breadth as a political thinker
was considerably fortified by the fact
that he had never even remotely looked
like going Communist, and that the
view he took of large matters was the
view of an Englishman.
In this faith they were strengthened
by the last great occasion of this first
volume, the meeting in October, 1935.
when the aged leader of the Labor
party. George Lansbury, offered to
resign rather than back-up the proposal
to apply sanctions to Mussolini: —
“If some people do not allow us
to do so, I am ready to stand as the
early Christians did and say, ‘This is
our faith, this is where we stand and,
if necessary, this is where we will
die.’ ”
The effect of this, in times still heavy
with pacifist emotion, must have been
considerable—“To follow such a speech
was difficult enough: to fly in the face
of the sentiment to which Lansbury
had made so strong an appeal needed
a determination which few men com-
mand.” But Bevin turned the difficulty
into an opportunity, and added another
to the list of unforgettable English
remarks:—
“It is placing the Executive and
the Movement in an absolutely
wrong position to be taking your
conscience round from body to body
to be told what vou ought to do with
it”
A footnote says that this is the
Official report; others had “trailing” or
hawking” instead of “taking.” But
however it went, it was the most
knurchillian remark in the hush that
ed up to World War 11. a phrase for
hurchill himself to compete with, and
might well have been enough to make
jvin number-one on Churchill’s list
requirements from his Labor allies
m 1940.
Manners
Just how one should acknowledge
Judith Countess of Listowel’s Manual
of Modern Manners (Odhams) the
reviewer, who always has to send out
for such a guide when answering invita-
tions. does not know. One never
manages to keep one handy, because
it’s so long between invitations; besides,
it is frightening to have alongside you
a book whose every page reminds you
that you can never open your mouth
or sign your name in refined circles
without putting your foot in it. Now,
take Deans. If you are writing to one
you don’t know you have to say:—
Very Rev. Sir.
I have the honor to remain. Very
Rev. Sir.
Yours sincerely.
If you have met him you can relax,
but only a little: —-
Dear Dean,
Believe me, dear Mr. Dean (or
Dear Dean),
Yours sincerely.
Maybe if you know him intimately
you could say:—
Dean, dear ;
but on this the Countess is silent.
Either you can give the game away
completely or learn by experience and
take your snubs and sniggers like a
man; and if you decide on this second
course you could surely have no better
guide than this up-to-date compendium,
introducing which the Countess says
firmly and sensibly;—
Etiquette is a code of
behavior, which most people know
vaguely, but few people know
exactly.
There are chapters on home and
friends, guests; conduct and communi-
cations concerned with christenings,
engagements, announcements of broken
engagements, weddings, receptions and
funerals; parties, party announcements
in the press, invitation-cards, applica-
tions for tickets to the Royal Enclosure
at Ascot; dances, hunt-balls; letters of
introduction —the whole works —with
even a chapter on business-conduct at
the office party and at the board meet-
ing. another on tipping: caddies. 4s. a
round; bedroom steward on an Atlantic
boat. £2; bath attendant. 10s.: table-
waiter. £2. Launching a De-Luxe
Debutante, by the way. costs £8125;
while a Shoestring Debutante costs
only £713.
There is a full list of precedence in
England and in Scotland, from Esquires
and Gentlemen to her Majesty the
Queen; a list of French and Latin tags
and phrases; and another of abbrevia-
tions. in which 13 pages very properly
separate A.A.D.C.s (Air Aides-de-
Camp) from the Y.W.C.A.

A Commodity of Dreams: Howard
Nemerov (Seeker and Warburg). A
collection of short-stories by the New

Most of the plots, stripped of their
trappings of extremely careful prose,
owe their tone to the currently popu-

from Pfeiffer and the rest, and
undoubtedly the whole cult has its
origin in and reflects one facet of our
