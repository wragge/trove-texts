The Red Page
Shakspeare Identified?
Two of the contributors to the Red Page
that . they , ure convinced that
lUr -V looney has identified “Shakspeare”
with Edward De Vere, Earl of Oxford I
disagree with them.
mi J w;;) assume, though I by no means ad-
taat. there 1S some difficulty in believing
)"} a y. tbeil ' reputed author wrote the plays
°t Shakspeare, and follow Mr. Looney in his
search for a substitute. His first step is to
endeavor to form an estimate of the charac-
ter ot the writer from his work, and I note
three points worthy of attention. (1)
Shakspeare’s support of aristocracy and
sympathy with the Lancastrians. There is
some ground for alleging both of these, but
to jump from them to the supposition that he
was lnmselt a nobleman ana - connected with
tne. Lancastrians is unwarrantable. (2)
Looseness in money matters. Looney’s argu-
a° n . this point > based Shakspeare’s
attitude towards Bassanio and Shylock, is
ludicrous. (3) Wide knowledge of the clas-
sics. lhis has, in my opinion, been shown
to be a myth. J. M. Robertson has com-
pletely answered the anti-Stratfordians on
this point.
• rJ tl lr T n , ex *v ste P in tbe search was the find-
ing ot De Vere’s verses on “Woman.” These
verses are in the metre of “Venus and
Adonis. Looney regards them as Shaks-
pearean in style and sentiment. As to this
opinions may differ, and, so far as the mat-
ter is one of taste, I think Looney is wrong
Moreover, as a matter of fact, there is one
notable difference. .In De Vere’s verses
every line is “stopped”; in “Venus and
doms, as in the rest of Shakspeare’s work
lines 6 4116 a large proportioll of “ rui i on’’
ihen Looney submits for comparison a
prose letter of De Vere. In this case Tt is
still more evident that the style is not
tonakspeare s, and again as a matter of fact
?^° pmi a n ’ 11 is notie eable that at least
four words occur in the letter which are
l ‘f d b y Shakspeare. The word
-ormfyeth, when Shakspeare always uses
“ornament,” is particularly striking
chapter is devoted to an identification
Sf„2 e I) r'^ lai character of the two authors.
Most of the characteristics would apnlv
equaHy weH to any dramatist of the period,
while those which fit Oxford specially are
pi ecisely those which I have objected to in
1 money s analysis of Shakspeare s character
as Hnf'w ry f U '„ ,)a “ se 7 d 011 insufficient grounds.
» t let us follow Looney in his comparison
°r lof ~ 'e st ' ere ’ s known work with that
of .Shakspeare. There is a chapter containing
a series of parallel passages which displays
a literary ineptitude surpassing even the
Bacomans’. Quo sample .should suffice!
i aiairelisui is shown bv references t,,
woman’s complexion as white and red and
torrim T X Jily and rose as siSs re
fen mg to the contrast. What poet, in the
Hmsf be - 11 °v ““a other period > Ila s not used
view “rtf'* Fr^ m tbe literary point of
slum’ ■ thdt we have is a comparison of
styles in prose and verse, which, in mv
opinion, tells against Looney’s theory
We go on now to an examination of the facts
of De Vere’s life. Bertram in “All’s Well”
is, Looney says, modelled on Oxford. Both
were royal wards, both wished to go to the
wars,_ and were hindered by their guardians
to s T? remarkable in these similar!'
tns. But listen! It .is said, in Wright’s
thatoOvfnrd E H SeX ’ ’ tbat Burleigh" contrived
i f d » tllen estranged from his wife
(RfiHeigh s daughter), should .sleep with her
believing her to be another woman. “Thus
even in the most extraordinary feature of the
pla i’V- the records of Oxford are at one
with the representation of Bertram.” Surely
Mr. Looney knows that Boccaccio, not Shaks-
to. , mycuted . th( - extraordinary incident,
I f. the coincidence, even if the story
™ !re . trHe > would prove nothing
ftoto-ri t llB T th i! t - lt: , Js highly improbable
Oxfoid wrote this play, because he would
hardly have chosen this story to dramatise.
ton to S ” lg °?.. to the arguments drawn from
the literary life of De Vere, we find that he
was born in 1550. In 1584 he was the
patron ot the “Oxford Boys,” and of Lyly
and I eele, and himself known as the author
ot lyric verse and of comedy. None of his
comedies have survived, nor is there, I think
any record of their publication. We are
aBbed , tp Relieve that, having written, but
toc4i o >l hl led - a inuA bel ' of plays for his o w n
\vmu ™ \ n 1090 ’ assu med the mask of
' ,un Shakspeare, an obscure actor in
another theatre, and began a new literarv
work r ‘nf- iY’f ° f US h i lve th °UBht that the
woik of Shakspeare showed a progressive
development from the ’prentice stage of the.
early comedies to the master’s work in the
later comedies and the great tragedies Mr
Looney, however, regards “Love’s Labor
wnrt a ij- qi in te Cq, - a] , t 0 much of the later
work llis theory is that the early comedies
are the work of a mature dramatist, aged
40, and that the author then enters on a
new career, which culminates, at the age of
54, with the production of “Hamlet.” Such
paralleled Career 18 certainly not to be
mask? Note that the dis-
guise is assumed for both plays and poems.
Baconians suggest that their hero was
ashamed to put his name to stage plays,
xnat could have no application to Oxford

m .comedy-” Nor, of course,
’P?H d X l pply to - Poems, and particu-
latcd in S °T etS ’ which were circu-
lated in MSS. only. It would have been
preposterous says Looney, for the Stratford
man, aged 2b. a newcomer to London, to ad-
diess to Southampton an admonition to
marry, but he thinks it probable that Oxford
thonl 1 ! 0t 40 ’ desired that Southampton
should marry his daughter, should do so It
does not sound wildly proßable to me ‘but
if it were, why should Oxford get Shakspeare
to name to them? By the way it is
noticeable that Looney makes no attempt to
solve the problem, Who was the rival poet’
Obviously it does not suit him to emphasise
i • r lat *he writer of the sonnets com-
plained of a rival for the patronage of the
addressee. De Vere, E-ftrl of Oxford, Lord
Lieat Chamberlain, could hardly be a suitor
for the patronage of the youthful Henry
f But, of course, it was all part
ot the disguise!
Looney never gives any reason for the
assumption of the mask. He never shows
uny connection between He Vere and
bhakspeare. He apparently does not realise
tnat his theory raises, difficulties beside
which those of the Stratfordians pale their
ineffectual fires. Once mounted on his hobby-
horse, the highest hurdle does not daunt him.
He admits that “The Tempest” was published
long after the death of De Vere, Very well.
It is not Shakspeare’s. For a specimen of
weird reasoning and want of literary taste
and feeling, commend me to the chapter in
which this theory is “proved.”
There is one statement in his preface
which the author proves uo to the hilt. He
is “not a literary expert.” .But he is bitten
by the “discovery” microbe. How intelligent
people, not so infected, can be convinced by
him is to me a mystery. I wish half the
attention that has been given to this ignorant
mystery-monger had been devoted to the
painstaking and scholarly work of Dr. Wal-
lace on “Elizabethan Drama,” in which
Oxford is truly depicted as occupying a very
honorable and important position'in that de-
velopment of the Elizabethan stage which
made the work of Shakspeare possible.
M. M. P.
Sappho and Sapphics
Mr. McKee Wright (R.P. 10/11/’2l) is
fascinated as a poet by the beauty of our
idea of Sappho; I, who also long for the
unattainable, think we know very little
about her, and what we do believe we know
is more discreditable to mankind than to
Sappho. Each of us has formed his own idea
of her through his own subconscious mind;
is that merely up-to-date jargon for saying,
that beauty lies in the eyes of the be-
holder ? Possibly the existence of a school
for poetry with Sappho at its head—a school
which turned out some most competent
pupils—may have led to the beginning of a
Sapphic legend, something after the style of
‘ lhe Ring and the Book,” of which we have
been hearing lately.
I should like to add a little to my remarks
on the Sapphic metre, which may have seemed
to refer to its modern version rather than to
Sapphos. During the Middle Ages some
hymn-writers made the Sapphic both easier
and .less dignified than her own ; and the re-
sult is the degraded “Sapnbic” as represented
m the Needy Knife-grinder” of Canning,
and the translation by Quiller-Couch that
I quoted :
Needy knife-grinder, whither are yon going?
Rough is the r6ad—your wheel is out of order,
meak blows the blast, your hat has got a hole in’t,
bo have your breeches!
L nee xTr ri ? t say that this is worlds apart from
Mr. Vi right s beautiful little poem, which,
though not in Sapphics, yet somehow conveys
a sense of her gracious dignity and haunting
ci ef; so ' ave the medievalists de-
graded Sappho’s metre that it seems more
suited for Canning’s jeering satire than fo
love-poetry, and I wonder that some irreveren ;
youngster lias not tried it in The Bulle
tin’s political verse.
But in Swinburne’s hands the' real thin
became gorgeous :—•
All the night sleep lay not upon my eyelids,
bhed not dew, nor shook nor unclosed* a feather
ye t with lips close shut and with eyes of iron
Stood and beheld me.
I will not spoil the pleasure of, R.P. reader
by quoting more; they should read the ex
quisite thing in full in the first section o’
•Poems and Ballads,” which has only re
cently come to hand after the Sydney book
sellers had been sold out for weeks.
Swinburne here caught the real Sapphic
majesty of rhythm, and I fancy Mr. Wrigh
will agree with me that her poetry was so
exquisitely singable—sq emphatically song
poetry that a legend grew up about her
memory that she was a composer herself and
that she invented the plectrum and a new
mode.” Possibly the vague and obsolete
music to which she sang could not be writ-
ten in modern notation: who can say how
it would sound to us? Was it a chant, like
the mediaeval monks’? Or a kind of inton-
ing, such as you hear in the Church of Eng-
land ? Or even a howl, like an Arab’s love-
song- which can move men to such a frenzy
of desire? If a woman were to sing to-day
exactly as she sang, in a modern drawing-
room to a pack of half-naked females, would
they like it? Anyhow, I firmly believe that
some of the reputation of Sappho is due to
her wonderful metre, just as some at least of
the reputation of Homer is due to his thun-
dering hexameters.
Anyone daring the true Sapphic strophe
must lay his account for two things—firstly,
it is enormously difficult in English:
secondly, Swinburne, who did it so beauti-
fully, was a poet to whom metrical difficul-
ties did not seem to exist. None the less, I
believe it to have been still the most graci-
ously beautiful series of rhythmical sounds
ever devised; and, though Swinburne suc-
ceeded in mimicking her rhythm, yet still his
poetry was “not in the least like hers, and
would have shocked her unutterably, not as
woman, but as artist.”
C. McL.
Is Fiction Literature?
I According to Herbert A. Giles (“The
Civilisation of China”), though litera-
ture is placed by the Chinese far above
all the arts, the novel is not regarded by
them as a literary production. No Chinese
writer of first-class rank has put his name
to a long work of fiction; and although
novels,old and new exist in countless thou-
sands they are not written in the book lan-
guage of literary China.
The Chinese, with their long history and
old civilisation, have tried and discarded
much that Europeans are still experimenting
with. They had movable types for printing
in 1043, but they kept to their old method
of making books, which is, after all. not so
unlike the one we have ourselves evolved after

Life Made Worth Living by
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
A badly-working liver is not only responsible for an immense amount of suffering,
but causes the possessor to take a very pessimistic view of life. All the world appears
wrong, and your friends seem to be enemies. This was about the condition in which Mrs.
Bantine found herself before taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills. The remarkable
change that followed is best described in her letter, which reads: —
97 Abercrombie Street, Chippendale, N.S.W.
Dear Sirs,
During the past eight years, thanks to the remedial efficacy
of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, I have been enabled to enjoy a
healthy existence, and life has been made worth living. Previous
to this I suffered from an almost chronic state of biliousness and
sick headache, and was consequently always in a weak, depressed,
anaemic condition. The first dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
was the turning-point in my sickness. From this moment I never
once looked back, for as my old ailments were gradually thrown
off renewed health and strength began to take their place, and
within four months’ time I was rejoicing in complete restoration to
health, which, I am thankful to say, has endured to the present
time.
(Signed) Mrs. A. Bantine.
(From a Photo.)
Nine out of every ten persons suffer more or less from Liver Complaint. That
feeling of “No energy” and “Not too well” are but symptoms of a weak and disordered
system. Weak, because the whole vitality is absorbed by a sluggish liver, inactive
kidneys and constipated bowels, for not only is the liver the largest and one of the
most important organs in the human body, but when deranged it becomes the source
of endless suffering. When the liver is clogged by the inactivity of the kidneys and
bowels it becomes torpid, and fails to filter the bile from the blood, thus producing bilious-
ness and a general impairment of the digestive system. There is little use of treating the
liver separately, as it can never be set right until the kidneys and bowels are made active
in removing the waste matter from the body. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
searching, cleansing remedy. They put a move in your bowels, life into the liver,
and tone the stomach, thus bracing up the system generally.

Comstock’s “Dead Shot”
Worm Pellets.
A SAFE, SURE AND RELIABLE
REMEDY FOR THE ERADICATION
OF WORMS IN CHILDREN AND
ADULTS.
Worms, by their movements and the in-
terruption they offer to the contents of the
bowels, generally occasion pain and uneasi-
ness in the abdomen, sometimes spasmodic,
sometimes gnawing or biting, and not infre-
quently of a vague, indescribable character,
and yet very distressing. Sympathetic with
this is a sensation of itching at the anus
and at the nostrils, producing a disposition
to scratch the fundament and pick the nose,
which is characteristic of this affection. The
bowels are often discolored, sometimes con-
stipated or stopped, and somet'mes relaxed,
with occasional bioody discharges, as in
dysentery. The discharge is sometimes in
shreds or flakes, which are not infreouently
mistaken for fragments of partially digested
food. It is not uncommon for portions of
undigested food to pass with the discharges.
The appetite is exceedingly variable, in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving or
d 'praved; one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The abdomen is
often hard, swollen and tympanetic, the
breath heavy or foetid, and tongue furred,
with disagreeable taste, and a copious flow
of saliva; swelling of the upper lip, bleeding
of the nostrils and disposition to grind the
teeth during sleep, are other character-
istic symptoms. The effects, however, often
extend beyond the alimentary canal, and
various derangements of health are experi-
enced in consequence either of the direct
Tritation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among the
most common of these are nervous affections,
such as fretfulness, irritation of temper,
wakefulness or disposition to excessive sleep,
disturb' d sleep, sudden starting out of sleep
as if from fright, dizziness, spasmodic move-
ments of the eyelids, dilated pupils, perverted
vision, temporary blindness and deafness.
General convulsions are not infrequent in
■hildren, and symptoms strongly resembling
•‘Water on the Brain” have been ascribed to
worms and have ceased on their expulsion.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to re-
cognise the fact that their little ones are
suffering intense pain and distress, and are
practically irresponsible for the outbursts
of temper, restlessness and peevishness, and
until some more serious symptoms appear
nothing is done to alleviate the distress.
The symptoms of this disease are somewhat
variable, but generally they are so char-
acteristic that no mother need have any
doubts. The best proof of worms is worms,
and if the general conduct of the child is
such as to give the slightest suspicion, ah
examination of the stools (evacuation from
the bowels) will afford ample proof.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It becomes
peevish and irritable in its temper, and com-
plains of itching of the nose, whilst the
same symptoms may be very prominent in-
deed in the lower part of the bowel. An-
other point to which the attention of
mothers should be specially directed is that
the child is apt to start in its sleep, its re-
pose being in this way of a disturbed nature.
Note also that many children who are in the
t>abit of wetting their beds do so by reason
of the irritation wh : ch these Worms pro-
duce in the body, the irritation extending
to the bladder and causing it involuntarily

In every heap of decaying matter there is
always to be found a nest of worms. They
breed and multiply in impure matter. And
so it is in the human system. The accumu-
lation of partially-digested food in the intes-
tines, which becomes putrid when the bowels
are constipated, induces the presence of
worms. A few doses of Comstock’s “Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets, followed by a dose or
two of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, will
disturb them in their nest, and drive them
out of the system.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation,
compounded on a scientific principle for the
eradication of worms which infest the intes-
tines. They contain specific properties
which destroy the worms, but cause no
injury to the stomach or bowels, and do not
weaken the system. The pellets are pre-
pared in the form of a confection or lolly,
have no disagreeable taste or smell, but, on
the contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.

PINKETTES
FOR SICK HEADACHE
Most people suffer at regular
intervals from sick-lieadache. The
trouble is caused by accumulation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coated ovals that act
so gently that they are the ideal
laxative' to use in correcting a
tendency to sick headache. They
have no unpleasant effect to make
them objectionable to the extra-
sensitive sick-headache patient.
Old-fashioned harsh purgatives
will not do at all in such cases.

Clouds.
Across the blue suffused with gold the clouds
far-flung sail high,
Like argosies of Fairyland with cargoes tor
the sky.
They splash the waters rippling green with
shadows moving slow,
Where panting fussily along the busy femes
go.
They skip past headlands clad with trees
in various robes of green,
And flick by red-roofed cottages that nestle
in between.
They sigh past Granny as she sits, they flirt
past Tot and Beth:
Filmy they thin away until they vanish in
a breath.
But still the waters ripple on while shtlflows
soft and slow , ~
Lie on the path where fussily the panting
ferries go.
And still the doubts upon my mind are
vagrom, faint and few, .. .
Nor can they block at all the path that
leads my thoughts to you.

The Long Grey Water.
As I crossed over the long grey water
To the little grey town by the sea.
The silver gulls in the early dawning
Called clear to me:
Oh, wide is the world for knowing,
And far runs the following foam,
With a free wind carelessly blowing,
And narrow the bars of home.
As I looked over the long grey water
From the little grey town by the sea.
The speckled thrush in the hawthorn bush
Whistled to me:
Oh, wide is the ivorld for roaming,
And far dips the sparkling sky,
With a long wave crisping and foaming,
And a white cloud scurrying by.
So I am gone on the long grey water,
For how could it other be,
When there’s ever a bird with a vagrant song
Will carol to me:
Oh, wide is the world of wonder,
And far flows the billowing sea;
There's a blue sky over and under,
And the bough of a growing tree.
If I come not again on the long grey water
To the home-town set by the sea,
You will know that the birds in the far, dim
lands
Have whispered to me:
Oh, wide is the world for roaming,
And great are the gifts bestowed,
Sunsets and dawn and gloaming,
And the never-ending road.

Evening.
I shall learn of my love
And my love shall learn of me
When there are stars above
And the moon hangs in the tree,
When the dusk comes down the grass,
Walking on velvet feet,
And the low winds pass
Sighing and home-sweet.
All in the yellow of day
There shall be running and crying
After time on its way
And the hawk-moments flying;
But twilight shall glimmer to-night
Saying this only:
“The home lamps are alight;
I am no more lonely.”
There are twelve worlds to cross
Between dawning and noon,
And twelve countings of loss
Ere the blink of the moon;
Far and far shall our feet
Walk on a separate way,
But all roads shall meet
At the homing of day.
For God made the morning
Of splendor and fire,
For striving and scorning
Of peace and desire,
For the sailing of ships
Blowing white on the foam;
But the evening has lips
To cry wanderers home.
So at the falling of day.
When the lamps are lighted,
Far and far away
Shall all lands be sighted,
As from a masthead above
The lift of a auiet sea:
And I shall learn of my love.
And my love shall learn of me.

A NEW WAY OF BUYING VOTES.
A year ago Lang, the N. S.- Wales Trea-
surer. with the solemn pride of a man
wrestling with his first Budget, announced
that more taxatioji was necessary, his pre-
decessor having left him a deficit of a mil-
lion and a half. Actually a million of this
was non-recurrent expenditure—£3B3,ooo
was for railway passes to relatives of re-
turning soldiers, £330,000 for the expenses
of, and claims arising out of, the influenza
epidemic, and £227,000 for the carriage of
fodder to starving stock, to quote only three
items —but Lang forgot to mention it.
Eager to get more money to play with, he
raised railway freights and fares 16f per
cent., levied new stamp and probate duties,
bumped up the betting imposts and the har-
bor and tonnage rates, and doubled the super-
tax on incomes and the ordinary tax on
companies, the lowest increase on all classes
of income-taxpayers being 4d. in the £ and
the highest Is. 3d. By these devices, and
by hitting things up. in the loan department,
he got £144,000 more revenue than he bar-
gained for, and liis calculations were lavish.
The State enterprises yielded £007,000 less
than the estimate, but the revenue from taxa-
tion and Crown lands exceeded it by
£1,051,000. Income-tax alone returned
£006.000 more than was anticipated, and
£2,091,000 more than in 1919-20. And bor-
rowed money was disbursed with such regal
magnificence that £7 7s. per head was added
to the public debt. Compared with the last
Pre-war year the revenue went up
£10,830,000 (£7 10s. sd. per head), and even
Holman had a credit balance of £596.700
111 , _ Yet Lang had to confess last
weelc that, instead of wiping out the deficit
with the additional £2,760.000 he extorted
through the Taxation Department, he had
spent £445,000 more than had come in, and
that he would be a further two millions
behind this year unless he looted the tax-
payers of a corresponding amount. And
then he hasn’t provided for the million or
so overpaid to the owners of 1915-16. 1916-
1/ and 1920-21 wheat, for the half-a-million
guaranteed to those whose grain, after being
taken out of their hands, was ruined by
mice and weevils, or for the £1,35,000 per
month promised by the egregious McGirk
to mothers with votes.
* * * *
To realise the full gorgeousness of Lang’s
achievement it is_ necessary to read the dull
records of Victorian finance. On a revenue
from all sources 0 f £18,522,534 (£l2 2s. per
head). McPherson, the Victorian Treasurer,
not only paid his way in Lang’s annus
miraoilis, but had £156,936 to appropriate
in a burplus Revenue Bill. It was his
fourth successive surplus (total, £899,000),
and w r as arrived at without bleeding the
taxpayer at every turn. In point of fact,
apart from the betting duties imposed before
the Melbourne Cup, there hasn’t been any
new direct taxation for five years. The
Victorian income-tax is the lowest in the
Commonwealth: this is how it compared
with the Ma State iniquity during the
p'7r3. V no^. ollt l , in which McPherson was
£106,936 to the good and Lang £445.000 to
the bad:—

M hieli shows, among other things, that
Lang increased the tax on companies and
private incomes beyond £9700 by more than
the rates which have stood unaltered im
Victoria since 1917, and then he couldn’t
make ends meet. He now pleads that it
will take another lot of forced levies, not to
wipe out the accumulated deficit of two mil-
lions and a quarter blit to produce a wretched
credit balance on the current year’s trans-
actions of £17,000, whereas McPherson has
budgeted for a surplus of £22,000 without
raising the income-tax a cent. The Vic-
torian Treasurer has even allowed for a re-
duction of £291,000 from this source, recog-
nising that it is a time of slump. By his
prudent handling of the finances, his care-
ful abstention from the madness of over-taxa-
tion and his steadfast refusal to find money
for such demented expedients as the idle
Saturday, he has strengthened the ability of
his people to meet the slump and keep the
wheels of industry moving at a time when
many N. S. Wales enterprises, Sore-oppressed
by penal taxes, the basic wage, the 44-hour
week, low prices and foreign competition,
have closed or are closing down. And it
hasn’t been all plain sailing in the Victorian
Treasury. The Government railways, like
those of every other State, have been a contin-
ual worry ; last year they showed a loss of
£obu,oo9, which was relatively larger than
Ma State’s £577,032. All things considered,
McPherson’s difficulties at the outset of
the year were quite as formidable as Lang’s.
But the Victorian Government didn’t behave
as if the public purse was as bottomless as
the pit. It didn’t appoint 13 Ministers to
do the work of eight, or give every member of
the Assembly a £375 p.a. rise, or fool away
about £lOO,OOO in useless boards and royal
commissions. It didn’t find room in depart-
ments that were already overmanned for
fresh hordes of civil servants. Neither did
it spend £2500 a week in keeping an army
of its supporters—a whole townful —idle
and distributing doles so lavish that it paid
men better to loaf than to work. These
idiosyncrasies, and a score of others equally
characteristic, were reserved for the gang
that holds office, with the permission of D.
Levy, in N. S. Wales.
* *■ * *
In the tumult of emotions excited by the
worst Budget ever foisted on an Australian
electorate Lang, has been lauded for his
“candor” —as if a ruinous spendthrift who
points a gun at the public and demands two
millions is worthy of admiration because he
mentions the precise amount. It is the
gentleman’s lack of candor that is more
remarkable. Nowhere does he refer to the
open and notorious fact that the country
is carrying too great a deadweight of Gov-
ernment employees, many of whom, as even
McGirr hinted when introducing the
Motherhood Endowment Bill, haven’t enough
to do to keep themselves warm. Of economy
in this direction there isn’t so much as a
promise, though even the Labor Government
in Queensland has been “deflating” its Rail-
way Department and cutting out the tem-
porary-clerk swindle by compelling the per-
manent penjostlers to put in another 21
hours per week. It is spend ! spend ! spend !
all the time with Lang. He demands that
the harassed taxpayer shall find another
£510,000 for the civil servants and an addi-
tional £343,000 for the railway employees,
“due to the Board of Trade determination
of 1920.” If he were honest he would admit
that these enormous burdens on industry
(the bulk of them, at any rate)
have been rendered unnecessary by a later
Board of Trade determination, ’ but his
alleged candor doesn’t go to that length.
In the same disingenuous spirit he asserts
that “the necessity for new taxation has
been brought about principally to cover the
loss on the railways,” albeit it is plain on
his own showing that if the Commis-
sioners were allowed to save a quarter
of a million or thereabouts by honor-
ing the latest Board of Trade determination
and £75(3,000 more by doing away with the
mad 44-hour week the railway accounts could
be balanced. To tax a community up to
the limit—a community whose industries are
in a sick and sorry condition —in order that
State servants may be presented with
£750,000 to which the recognised tribunal
says they are not entitled, and that porters,
ticket-takers, carriage-cleaners, dining-car
stewards and lavatory attendants may have
four hours knocked off the working week, is
not only a financial blunder but a crime
of the first magnitude. Every citizen on
a fixed salary is to be plundered, every
struggling producer, farmer as well as manu-
facturer, is to have a new load placed oh
his shoulders, that a cynically unprincipled
Government may purchase the railway and
civil service vote.
POWER WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY
There are two chief methods by which
autocracy expresses itself in government.
The one more favored by the born tyrant is
control by means of ukases, rescripts or pro-
clamations, the system under which this
country lived throughout the war. The
other does not offer the executive the same
opportunities for the direct exercise of
power, but it is even more objectionable in-
asmuch as it produces much the same effects
without giving the community a reasonable
chance to fix the blame when wrong is done.
The springing up since the Armistice of
immense departments exercising delegated
powers is a manifestation of the second
method of getting to the windward of the
people’s authority as represented by
Parliament. These bodies may be used
to save money or to waste it; but one
feature characterises all of them —they are
there to do the bidding of the Government to
which they owe their existence. The Repa-
triation Commission is an example of an
organisation created for the purpose of cut-
ting down expenses. It was appointed at
a time when the war-fever was dying, and
its policy was framed in anticipation of the
inevitable period when public interest in dis-
abled soldiers should be quite dead. The
Commission works nominally under an Act
of Parliament. But since it interprets the
Act itself, and since from its readings there
is no appeal, it is virtually as irresponsible
in its own sphere as W. M. Hughes was in
his before his War Precautions measures
lapsed. Parliament does not want incapaci-
tated ex-Diggers deprived of their pensions
on fine legal points if the speeches made
in both Houses count for anything. The
better sort of elector is also opposed to this
dishonorable brand of economy. But the
Commission, though nominally a soldiers’
Commission, in practice does the Govern-
ment’s dirty work. And an ex-soldier is
used by the Dooley Government in N. S.
Wales to further the repeal of the Soldiers’
Preference Act, and a General is found to
condone the dismissals of returned men at
Lithgow. Comradeship is dead so far as the
politicians are concerned; it is only the
machine that counts.
The War Service Homes Department is in
a different category. It is the fruit of pro-
mises too material and specific to be evaded
by trickery. After a certain point the Gov-
ernment had to go ahead, whether it thought
there was political capital in the venture or
not, and provide given classes of ex-Diggers
with homes. There was no charity involved.
The men were ready and willing to pay ; and
official figures show that, despite the disas-
trous quality of many of the buildings sup-
plied, the occupants—barring a negligible
few —are paying for them in a most loyal
and businesslike fashion. So far as the
public was concerned it had the right, seeing
that about £50,000,000 of its money is
destined to be spent, (1) to a Commission
carefully chosen to provide the most- econo-
mical results consistent with efficiency
and (2) to some means of redress in the
event of the appointees proving'dishonest or
incompetent. Colonel Walker was chosen
as Commissioner on the strength, chiefly, of
references as to his capacity supplied by
three persons whose names he gave to the
Minister for Repatriation. Or, rather, two
persons. It has been stated in Parliament
that one, Mr. Cupples, said Colonel Walker
was not qualified, and it has been further
stated that three public officials are willing
to swear that the Minister saw Cupples’s
opinion before the appointment was made.
Walker does not seem to have been given
mu'ch of a chance. The Commonwealth
Bank was allowed to share in his work, with
the natural result that the new department
found itself in competition with the estab-
lished one. That is the only apparent justi-
fication for certain astonishing purchases
made by the Commission, resulting in the
loss of hundreds of thousands of pounds
sterling to the taxpayers, and for the fevered
efforts to right such errors by smart work
in other directions. The Caldwell case,
which was dealt with by The Bulletin
some months ago, is an example of the
efforts made by the Department to right
itself. Caldwell had in his pocket a recom-
mendation from the High Commissioner for
the Pacific for a lease of two British Solo-
mon Islands containing timber areas. He
began negotiations with the Commission.
The Commission, on discovering that his
lease was not signed, sealed and delivered,
in a manner of speaking, cabled to the High
Commissioner to drop Caldwell and let it
have his lease, the confessed object being to
swindle the finder of the area out of his
commission-money. This kind of practice,
like the Repatriation Commission’s readings
of the Pensions Act, would be understand-
able in a usurer or a shady attorney, but it
is a stain on the honor of the country when
employed by a great department; and it is
a stain by reason of the evident fact
that it has the Federal Government’s
approval.
The considerable section of the public
which holds that the Commonwealth’s obli-
gations to the soldiers who sacrificed them-
selves are as great now as when the Empire
was in danger has no redress whatever
against the Repatriation Commission. These
gentlemen are confiscating pensions in the
interests of the Treasury within the four
corners of the law. They are as immune, so
long as the Government stands by them, as
Shylocic was in respect, of a somewhat simi-
lar financial operation: It was Colonel
Walker’s misfortune that he had to spend
money instead of saving it; find in due course
his downfall came. Not the downfall of the
Ministry which appointed him, and consti-
tutionally as Well aS morally is to blame fdr
his mistakes; but only his downfall! Fof
close On a year the Joint Committee of Pub-
lic Accounts has been inquiring into the
alleged scandals, financial and otherwise, Of
the Walker regime, but for all the reslilfs
that have accrued the duty might as well
have been undertaken by W. M. Hughes or
One of his Ministers. Many of its findings
in the matter of timber and other purchases
have been dead against the weight of
evidence; and in the Caldwell case the
Committee took up an attitude which is ex-
plicable only on the grounds that a majority
of the members place constituted authority
first and ordinary British justice a bad
second. Caldwell had either been done out
of his rights by the Department or he was
a liar with no rights of which he could be
robbed. The joint committee refused to
allow him to be represented by a lawyer;
refused him the right of cross-examining any
witnessand found, eventually, that, while
under ordinary conditions, the treatment
meted out to him by the War Service Homes
authorities would amount to what it called
“sharp practice of a most reprehensible
character,” yet in this case dishonesty was
excusable, and the Department had to be
absolved. It is difficult in view of such hap-
penings to believe that a departmeiit ru*
commission will ever be blamed officially,
however careless its members may be about
outraging the feelings of the people Who have
to pay for their misdeeds. The HuGhES
Government has, in short, mitigated the
horrors of peace to the best of its ability by
transferring as many of. its war powers as
possible to more or less irresponsible bodies;
while seeing to it that they are the Govern-
ment’s pliant instruments ih return for their
salaries and immunity from punishment
when their mistakes become flagrantly evi-
dent. And Parliament, mindful of its £lOOO
a year, looks on in acquiescent silence I
TIME TO GIVE UP RAILWAYS.
The supreme ambition of Australia’s two
Labor Governments is to make every public
enterprise support as many of their sup-
porters as can be crowded on to it. Where-
fore private enterprise, in addition to carry-
ing its own burdens, is heavily taxed, ahd
taxed on a constantly increasing scale, to
support public enterprise and keep it alive.
In other words, public enterprise,, originally
established for the nation’s profit, has become
its royal family, its peerage, its established
ehuren, ana the rest of tae orthodox loads
and burdens and dead horses of the Dark
Ages, ail in one. Aot through any demerit
in the principle itself, but through the corrup-
tion which puts the best things to the worst
uses, it lias became a vested interest—a bigger
Circumlocution Office maintained for the good
of arrogant party Barnacles, and a stand-
ing fund for the reward of persons of the
“right color.” The JN. S. Wales railway
system, with a capital of £83,000,000 and
over £14,000,000 of annual revenue to play
with, is the biggest single affair of its sort
in Australia, and to-day it presents a more
exciting spectacle than ever before. It may
almost be said that it presents a more excit-
ing spectacle than anything in Australia ever
did before. For the year to June, 1020, the
Ma State, in addition to paying 53 per cent,
higher fares and 40 per cent, higher freights
than in 1914, was taxed £129,125 for the
privilege of having railways. For the year
to June, 1921, in addition to paying 66 per
cent, higher fares - and 51 per cent, higher
freights, Ma had to pay in taxes £577,032
for the joy of having railways. Even blind
people who couldn’t see them, and bedridden
people who couldn’t use them, and remote
people 200 miles beyond railhead who
couldn’t benefit by them, had to part up to
feed the great king octopus. The current
year is expected to be a great and indefinite
amount worse than anything yet heard of,
for there has been another general increase
of wages (the second or third) and (what
is far less justifiable) a big reduction of
working time below the 48-hours per week
standard, thus necessitating more expensive
hands and more expensive overtime. It
was thought in some quarters that with
another big increase in charges the railway
accounts might be squared. But the increase
of rates under the Dooley regime has
already been twice that of Victoria and
three times that of the other States; and it
has reached a point where more charge only
produces less revenue because the patient
dies on the ignorant practitioner’s hands.
N. S. Wales had, at June last, 23 separate
railways or sections, as against 18- a year
earlier, which refused to pay even working
expenses. They include almost everything
built in recent times, as well as a few grey-
haired paupers from far back in last cen-
tury :

Apart from any traffic they may bring to
the main lines, it wouldn't pay yet to close
these and the other 25 and sell them for
old junk, for they cover working expenses
and pay a trifle towards interest; but it
probably would pay to close most of them
a year hence if the 44 hours per week and
the basic wage and the multiplication of
appointments continue. Every year some
section of the N.S.W. system drops out of
Class I, w*hich pays full expenses and in-
terest, and into Class II, which pays expenses
and part interest. The next step is to
Class III, which pays neither. Class I (sol-
vent so far) includes 2071 miles of railway,
Class II (moderately insolvent! is, as
already mentioned, 2227 miles. Class HI
(broke) covers 744 miles. #
Theoretically the railways of the Ma
folate, like tliose of the other States, pay
in development if not in money. (There is
hd harder-worked word in to-day’s vocabu-
lary than “development"—Unless, perhaps, it
is “slogan.") They are supposed to bring
population and taxpayers to the Outback and
make the Wilderness blither like the rose.
As a-matter of fact they carry away coun-
try population to the One Great City. The
Increase or otherwise of settlement can be
estimated very well by the quantity of goods
that the railways carry for the settlers, and
this is the evidence

They were great and wdndetftil days for
building new loan railways, Were these war
years; but if half as much time had been
devoted to the plain honest -job of growing
things for the old railways to carry it Would
have profited the country more.
The Ma State, in fact, has spent enough
expensive loan money on new “development”
lines till it finds out the exact size and
nature of the worm at the root of the tree.
In the year which ended June, 1921, there
was certainly an increase in the quantity of
goods carried, but it was more than accounted
for by an increase in mineral traffic. That
is a low-priced, short-distance line of busi-
ness, and not the sort of thing which the
settler, put on the land with £1250 of mort-
gage to keep him company, is expected to
produce. By the building of long, curly rail-
ways that drag their weary miles like lame
boa-constrictors past all manner of good
ports on their way to Octopus Town, the
distance that the, settler has to send his pro-
duce has been quite wonderfully lengthened.
Thus the average haul of every ton of grain
on the N.S.W. railways is now 284 miles,
whereas 30 years ago it was 111 miles. It
might still be 111 miles or perhaps half
that but for the One Big City policy.
With two land taxes, two income taxes (one
of which is to be doubled), various stamp
duties, new customs and excise revenue
duties, 173 miles of extra railway haulage,
the necessity for paying far too much sea
freights, and the H.C.L. all added to the
farmer’s cares during the last 30 years, with
the prospect of the basic wage to boot, it is no
wonder that 1000 miles of new railway
should fail to develop extra settlers. And
new lines have no more luck in developing
passenger traffic than freight traffic. Pas-
sengers don’t increase except in Octopus
Town and its suburbs. The train mileage
in the country is being reduced to keep pace
with the atrophying of many country dis-
tricts. Until those districts set up separate
new States (North, South and Central) and
take their cow and and wheat affairs out of
the hands of city lawyers and trades-union
secretaries, real settlement is likely to re-
main “off.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Returned Soldiers and Political
Offensives.
Some months ago the N. S. Wales branch
of the R. S. League had the misfortune to be
identified with one or two political Generals.
The body duly became involved in anti-Labor
propaganda. Scott Fell (a flamboyant
Hughesite who has never fought for the flag
in person, but who periodically wraps him-
self'in it, metaphorically speaking, and chal-
lengingly proclaims his attachment to an in-
stitution which no sane Australian wants de-
stroyed) helped to engineer the demonstration
in the Svdney Domain that did so much to
divide the Diggers. The Returned Soldiers’
League got mixed up in the affair; and as an
instrument for the assistance of those Diggers
who need help, which is its only real justifi-
cation for existence, it seemed doomed. How-
ever, the peril was presently recognised and
the political members were requested to efface
themselves. The League immediately bora
to recover its punch: so that last week
General Brand was able to say:—
He had been advised often to steer clear of the
league, as it was a political body. He was not a
politician, and now that he was assured that the
league was non-political and non-sectarian he would
give it all the support he gave to the t ictorian
league.
The soldiers have already been pretty effec-
tively split up, at the instance of interested
parties proceeding on the “divide et impera
principle, into Returned Laborites’ Leagues,
Returned Cgtholics’ Leagues and other super-
fluous organisations. Last week the inevit-
able Mr. Scott Fell appeared at Sydney
Town Hall in association with yet another
League—the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Welfare
and Employment Association. “They were
meeting together,” he said naively—‘‘well, it
was not his function to say exactly what
for.” In the circumstances The Bulletin
is disposed to reveal it for him
When General:) Rosenthal and Herring were
strong in the councils of the R. S. League, it
appeared safe for Hughesism. the idea in Melbourne
was that any member who criticised the Govern-
ment in connection with its War Service Homes or
Pensions administration could immediately be
silenced by an accusation of disloyalty a loyalist
being, not a man who, having offered his own life
for the Empire, is now anxious to help ex-soldiers
whose lot is less fortunate than his own, but one
like Mr. Scott Fell, who talks like a soldier of
bellowdrama and acts like a politician.
Shortly after the passing of the Generals as
active forces it became evident that the League was
getting out of hand from the standpoint of the
Nationalist machine. The acid was put on it in
connection with the last visit of Mr. Hughes to
Sydney, and the executive failed to re-act in the
manner desired. The people who approached the
then President were told in effect that the soldiers
would put the official seal of their approval on
Hughes when he abandoned talking about his regal and
for the Diggers, and started doing something for
them.
And hence the “Welfare” Association.
It is natural that the politicians, Labor and
Nationalist, should be terrified of the soldiers
vote. It stands for about a million of the
best men and women in the Commonwealth.
Properly organised, and directed to serve the
legitimate interests of the Diggers, it ought
to go close to killing the party system on
which our professional politicians rely for :
livelihood. But it can only be so employed by
the coming together of the sold.ers, not as
Nationalists or Laborites, It.C.’s or Angli-
cans, but purely and simply as soldiers and
patriots. When they find a body which is
equally agreeable to bop into a Hughesite
candidate over a pensions scandal or a
Dooleyite nominee over an act .of injustice
done to a returned man at the instance of
one of those sections which hate the soldiers
—an organisation which declines with equal
vigor to be associated with Empire jingoes 01
Sinn Fein jingoes—then they will have
something that every party politician will
want to see dead, and every friend of the
A I.F. will want to see flourishing. The
R. S. League of N. S. Wales promises to de-
velop into something of the sort under its
new president, Colonel Vernon, as it, was
beginning to do under Mr. McDonald. No
better proof is needed than the growing dis-
like and distrust of it which are beconvng
evident amongst the wire-pullers of all par-
ties.
The Position in Ireland.
To follow the S. M. Herald’s expositions of
the Irish row is to conclude that it regards
most of its readers as wanting m the guts
of memory and reason. It summed up the
situation the other morning in this way .
The appeal bv the British Press to Ulster is to
resist the temptation, to play the game, to reject
the challenge to civil war. . .
As regards Sinn Fein’s “challenge to civil
war,” tw T o points will be in the minds of
most. One is that no street fighting has
been reported, since the London negotiations
began, outside Belfast district (that is to
sav, outside the region where armed Grange-
men predominate by 4 to 1) : the other that
in proportion as the Sinn E ein delegation
has disclosed its readiness to talk reason, the
Belfast shootings and bombings have in-
creased. And nearly all the disturbances
have borne a close resemblance to one whicn
was thus described in a Sun cable the day
after the appearance of the Herald s leader
complaining that “a campaign of murder and
anarchy w<is being carried into the ulster
capital” : . ' ~
Soldiers with an armored car were posted outside
the Clonard Monastery (Belfast) during vespers, with
orders to prevent an attack on the worshippers from
armed civilians who were observed lurking in the
vidnity. The worshippers left unscathed, but a
bomb was thrown in the Catholic quarter, wounding
two. A splinter from the bomb struck a Mis. Mac
namara in the throat. She is the mother of eigh
children The throwers emptied their revolvers into
the crowd, and Mrs. Macnamara was again wounded
in the leg and the back, and died in a few minutes.
Some facts which have been pretty conclu-
sively established by the comments even ot
such “die-hard” sheets as London Daily
Telegraph and Morning Post are.
(11 De Valera and his colleagues are eager to
remain in the Empire with a much smaller measure
of autonomy than one Australians or the Boeis
A vast majority of the British people are
an (S U Th o e'iuln o cnaU?s Of Ulster will be satisfied
with nothing but partition.
The main argument in support of partition
is based on the assumption that the Protes-
tants would be murdered under a union.
The obvious answer is that they have rarely
been so much as discriminated against in
the South and West, where the Catholics
are in 90 to 95 per cent, majorities. In the
words of Lecky, who. disliked a Catholic
Irishman as much as most English Piotes-
tants: —• .
No feature in the social history of Ireland is more
remarkable than the almost absolute security which
the Protestant clergy, scattered thinly over wild
Catholic districts, have usually enjoyed during the
Worst periods of organised crime Among the
Catholics, at least, religious intolerance has neyei
been a prevailing vice, and those who have studied
closely the history and the character of ,the Irish
people can hardly fail to be struek with the deep
respect for sincere religion in every form which thej
have commonly evinced.
It is clear that the Irish trouble could be
settled now on equitable terms, to the
strengthening of the Empire and the deep cha-
grin of Britain’s enemies in America and else-
where, if the Ulster maximalists would only
show a little sense and goodwill. In the cir-
cumstances it is difficult to see what high
Imperial purpose the Herald thinks it is
serving by encouraging the recalcitrants in
a course which menaces the prestige and
even safety of the Empire.
The “Loyalty” Smoke-screen.
“To my mind the real issue of this election is be-
tween two sets of principles—Empire unity and
loyalty as against the disintegrating forces in our
midst.”
H. E. Pratten. the Hughesite candidate for
Jce Cook’s seat at Parramatta, had better
drop that line. It is true enough that men
who care very little about the Empire, and
some who are even disruptionists, have gained
far too much influence among the Labor poli-
tical and other bodies. But in this matter the
National party doesn’t come into court with
clean hands either. Indeed, the most effec-
tive disintegration that is in progress is the
work of Nationalists. When the Empire
was threatened, seven years ago, the present
leader of the National party was one of
the most fluent promisers in the Common-
wealth in regard to the splendid things that
would be done for the heroes who fought to
save the world for freedom. He did not
tell them then that if they got wound and, or
if their health failed, they might be allowed
when they had served the purpose of his
Government (that of providing an impres-
sive Australian ouota for overseas service)
to starve in company with their families.
I-Ie did not mention that, as soon as the
danger appealed to be over, he would shelve
the responsibility for safeguarding their wel-
fare which he had assumed so readily when
there was polit cal capital in it; and still
less did he mention that this sacred duty
would be delegated to a commission which
would draw generous salaries for saving the
Treasury money at the expense of the
wounded and the ill. If the gassed, the
shell-shocked, the consumptive and the
maimed were having their miserable allow-
ances cut down here and docked altogether
there as part of a drastic national policy of
economy, the thing would at least be excus-
able: t'hev might perish with more resigna-
tion if they knew that patriotism was again
calling. But simultaneously with the
starting of the campaign against their pen-
sions Mr. Hughes had the effrontery to
put through the Parliamentary salary grab;
and he and his Ministers treat with and rision
any suggestion that they should forego a
farthing of this money. Could anything be
more ruinous to Empire unity now, or more
dangerous when the time again comes
for the Empire to be threatened? If Mr.
PrATTEN is really anxious to solid tv Em-
pire feeling in Australia he will table two
policies at Parramatta and stick to them:
(1) Strict economy, includhig retrenchment
amongst those who have no moral or other
claim on the State’s generosity; (21 the
honoring to the last farthing of the pledges
made to those who w°nt to the war fit and

Aloysius ami tne Apprentice.
N. S. Wales Attorney-General McTiernan,
who is a sort of lawyer himself, did the
celebrated act of Satan encouraging irriga-
tion the other day at Petersham High
School. He told the pupils of "the danger
of the professions becoming overcrowded as
a result of young men preferring professions
to commercial or trade careers. He re-
gretted,” etc., etc. Also "he emphasised,
likewise "he pointed out” —as wise young
politicians always do. But, after all, it is
a question whether Australia, Jun., has
quite the craving that is charged up aga-nst
him to be a solicitor, barrister, dfictor or den-
tist—especially a dentist, looking all day
into strange mouths and down unknown and
unattractive throats. It may be that he is
often driven to it by the silly, tyrannical
policy of the party that Aloysius McTier-
nan belongs to. It puts rigid restrictions
on the number of apprentices, and fences the
learning of a trade with so many obstacles
that trades would die out but for the impor-
tation of grown-up, ready-made artisans. To
any one over 21 who wants to learn a call-
ing, either because his old industry has
failed him or because he never had one, the
basic wage in some cases and specific awards
in others block the way absolutely, as no
one can afford expert’s pay for a raw be-
ginner’s services. The unions of lawyers
and doctors are open to every comer who
cares to acquire and demonstrate the, neces-
sary skill and whose character isn’t out-
rageous, a.nd with many youths who would
fain be manufacturers it is a choice of some-
thing in that line, or a laborer’s job, or, the
life of a nondescript. If every trade was
equally open there would be fewer medicoes,
tooth-draggers and limbs of the law; fewer
unemployed and unemployable ; less need
loans to perpetrate useless. jobs; less need
for imported goods of dubious origin that,
the country can’t afford to pay for. McTier-
nan presumably showed himself to a school-
boy audience as a. dreadful example and a
warning. But what is the use of McTier-
nan’s warning if McTiernan’s party won t
let the rising generation profit bv the de-
pressing spectacle of McTiernan?
Woe to the Sick!
“Owing to the lack of accommodation 53 serious
cases were turned away from Melbourne Hospital in
the last week in November. More than one-third of
the sufferers are likely to die.”
If 53 malefactors had to be turned
away from a gaol there would be a public
outcry sufficient to wreck the Government.
But since the rejects are merely law-abiding
citizens, many of whom are condemned to
death as a result of them exclusion, the
newspapers consider the episode worth only
a brief paragraph. The general attitude
towards our hospitals is very like that which
is common in reference to V.D.: both are
problems which menace the happiness, health
and even life of the community, but both
are too big to tackle. The Melbourne Hos-
pital is a good deal in the public eye just
now, chiefly because John Dwyer, an in-
jured lorry-driver, had to be tyrned away
a few days ago through lack of accommoda-
tion, and later died. But many of the public
hospitals in the other States are in a posi-
tion which is as bad, or worse. Some of
the arguments in support of the. old
system are clearly disingenuous, as, for
example, the one that the public should not
be deprived of the opportunity to perform
an act of holy charity by subscribing to the
upkeep of such places. As the public never
rises to the financial occasion in an adequate
manner (in the Melbourne institution the
excess of expenditure over revenue ran to
£12.000 last year), the voluntary donation
business may be said to be played out, apart
from the fact that it always has to be stimu-
lated in undesirable ways—as by a lottery
in Queensland and organised hogging cam-
paigns in the other States. It is a rare
thing for the question of public bospTals
tq be discussed amongst laymen .without an
almost universal agreement being arrived at
that the arrangement is unbusiness-like, illo-
gical and ineffective as regards the saving
of life. Its friends are the doctors. That
may seem odd at a glance, seeing they give
their services free of charge. But the thing
is by no means all altruism. The public
hospital where payments are negligible or
nil makes possible the private concern where
each patient pays on a lavish scale, and
where the doctor’s fees are proportionately
big. The public hospital is both a school
and a practice area for the profession: it
confers prestige, and to that extent it is use-
ful for the purpose of enforcing punishments
imposed by the B.M.A. The citizen s view-
point has been excellently put by Havelock
Ellis in “The Nationalisation of Health
It is enough to say here that a system which is
based on the tinkering with disease and which re-
gards as an impertinence the far more vital ques-
tion of prevention, stands a very poor chance of
being accepted as the system of the future.
The system of the future will see to it that
the public hospitals are so much bigger than
is necessary for normal conditions that they
will not be overtaxed when faced with abnor-
mal conditions, as most of them were dur-
ing the last influenza outbreak. It will
make the devising of methods to check dis-
ease a first charge on their energies. For
example, by the institution of ablution rooms
which were very efficacious in checking V.I).
in all the armies in the closing years of the
war, and which are being advocated for civi-
lian use by some of Britain’s most eminent
medical men to-day. The taxpayers will find
the money for such necessities in the same
way, and on thp same principle, as they are
already required to do in respect of then-
common drains and their naval and military
defence. And, of course, the honorary doc-
tor will go. There is no more excuse for
him in sense or ethics than there is for an
honorary rock-chonper or rat-catcher: and
like so'much else that is apparently cheap',
he is, when it comes to fundamentals, ex-
tremely expensive.
The Craze for Punishment.
Some people in this variegated world have
the craze for punishment so badly, and be-
lieve in it so thoroughly as a remedy for
every possible ill, that they would gladly
treat cancer by fining the patient to the
limit. Lands Minister Lougiilin, of N. b.
Wales, is a horrible example of the effiss.
His new Lands Confiscation Bill differs
from the old one (the one that had to be
smothered in its cradle else no more money
could have been raised in John Bull’s
country! in one or two notable particulars,
but the same old passionate resolve to break
things is there. It is no longer proposed
that a court of Ministerial creatures shall
fix the price of resumed properties without
anneal, and that nayment i hall be mm!
after indefinite years of waiting, am.. 1
onlv in depreciated low-priced pa. r <i
for redemntion about Judgment Da,
still provided that the old owner
tain only £20,000 worth of land, or,
as few acres as would be worth that *
if improved to the dizzy or impossibl ■> •->
but payment is to be made in cash sooner
or later. As the cash may be difficult to
procure, however, a most ingenious idea has
been evolved bv which it seems that the
man whose land is taken may be made to
provide the money himself in fines,
really to nay for being turned out. Once
notice of resumption is given the pro-
perty will fall into a state of suspended
animation, so t" speak, during which it will
not be worth while to do anything large or
permanent or expensive with it. It will
remain suspended till the Government has
the means and inclination to take it oyer
and complete the transaction. Yet during
this period the owner (who is really owner
no longer, but only a tired person waiting
and hoping for money) may be required to
do extraordinary things under extraordi-
nary penalties. In the first year of sus-
pense one-fourth of the area must be put
under cultivation or the fine will be one-
fourth of the annual value. If half of the
area is not put under crop in the second year
the fine or tax is to be half the annual value.
If three-fourths is not under the plough
after that the yearly penalty is to be three-
fourths of the value. It is a truly brilliant
batch of ideas. There is not enough labor
available to look after the vast area which
would become liable to cultivation under the
scheme. There is not enough money to pay
the labor, especially to pay it the proposed
basic wage. There would be a serious diffi-
culty even in finding enough implements,
also' half enough customers. The situation
might be relieved by enforcing the law only
against political opponents or against men
who failed to approach the Minister in a
proper spirit, but that sort of compromise
is wholly unsatisfactory. Most of the land
which would come under the fine or confisca-
tion clause because of its arable possibilities
is too remote from a market to pay in an
pn-ricultural sense even if it w T as as rich as
Paradise. Even now, w-ithout pushing things
any further out, the average railway haul, of
N. S. Wales wheat to the only permissible
outlet is 284 miles, and the cost is disas-
trous. It is a fashion -mth the newest school
of Bolshevik highbrow's to speak as if sheen
and bullocks were a crime to be hunted off
every scran of land that can by any pre-
tence be classed as arable, and to be finallj
chased down a steep place into perdition.
The two animals are .supnosed to represent
capitalism incarnate, also tyranny sitting en-
throned .in, the seats of the mighty. But
there are men of ouite moderate means mow
in the crazing business —the sheen business

The Cry for Help for Russia.
“Henky Horsecollar” has doubts about it:
For many months the Communists, Bolsheviks and
other human superfluities of Australia assured the
public that there was really no famine, or no famine
worth speaking of, in Russia, and that the tales
of horror which poured in from that LENiN-bedevilled
land were merely evidences of a gigantic conspiracy.
It was even urged that the Bolshevik Government
must be superlatively good when bad people took
so much trouble to discredit its management of
affairs. Things stood on this basis for a long time
in Australia’s best revolutionary and anti-Australian
circles. The unutterable scoff "'as thrown at those
who dreamed that anything could be really amiss
. under the best of all possible Soviet Governments,
and the unutterable sniff was used to express con-
tempt for the poverty of the “capitalistic” intelli-
gence which heeded, or expected others to heed, such
thin inventions. A sort of climax was reached when
Peter Simonoff, Bolshevik “consul” and apostle, in
the course of a send-off discoursed about the Lexin-
Trotsky paradise. Speaking at Perth, “he informed
the audience that high-class clubs and restaurants
in Russia were now comfortable clubs for common
people, and that there ,was nothing to pay. Free
admission to theatres was obtainable by simply
applying for tickets to the trades-union secretary,
and on Moscow trams people could ride for miles
gratis. The Soviet had established tens of thousands
of schools, hundreds of thousands of libraries, hun-
dreds of colleges and universities; pupils at schools
and colleges were clothed, fed and taught for no-
thing. They were all well dressed, happy and
healthy.”
But now Labor leaders of that color have sud-
denly charged their ground, and, without abating
a whit of their admiration for the splendid genius
with which the Soviet Government is said to have
managed things, and without taking down its friend
Peter Simonoff’s picture of Elysium from the wall,
have hoisted a new picture—one of unutterable misery
—and demand that 5,000,000 Australians shall hand
out their scarce sovereigns to save 20,000,000 Bol-
shevikised Russians from hunger-death of the most
horrible description. This is from their appeal:—
Nearly 20,000,000 of people are subject to famine
and its concomitant disease, cholera. There is no
milk, no food for millions of children. Mothers
and fathers, think of the sufferings of the little
children! Millions of men and women are driven
to eat food composed of clay, bark, leaves, flour
and grass. No hupian mind can encompass or com-
prehend the totality of human suffering of these
famine-strifcken peasants.
Now, there are several reasons why Australia
should think long and hard before it lashes out
with the bit of hard money which war and Labor
and Loan Governments have left to it. Some of
them ifiay be enumerated as follows:—
(1) There is a lack of explanation why certain
persons not held in very high esteem should change
their tune at a moment’s notice. The calamity
hasn’t come in a moment'. Why was the old lie
told ? Why isn’t it told now ?
(2) There is a lack of information about the
people who propose to handle the money at this
end. If they are in any way related to the sort
of people who buy coal-mines and road-metal quarries
for the City of Sydney, and sell bonds (payable
nowhere and bearing no interest) to City Council
employees, and apply the proceeds to cover their
own election expenses, they seem a rackety lot to
trust with big affairs.
(3) There is a lack of news about the people
who are to be trusted with the money at the other
end, supposing it gets that far. If they are the
old gang of Red Militarists and Debt Repudiation-
ists at Moscow there is a dark suspicion that it
isn’t worth while to subscribe anything for all the
chance the starving people by the Volga have of
benefiting.
(4) There is a certain suspicion attaching to an
appeal that is based on brazen and insolent lies—
the appeal not of the plain unmounted beggar but
of the patronising and accusing mendicant on horse-
back. r
Russia should be rich, for it is the only white or
brown or yellow man’s country in the world with
no war debt and no peace debt either, having repu-
diated the lot. It is a reasonably fertile land not
over populated and supposed to be at peace. Its
crop shortage (said to affect one-fifth of the popu-
lation) is not nearly as bad as that of Australia
has been again and again. But an ordinary everyday
local shortage may become hideous famine and wide-
spread death if the Government is bad enough.
And unless the country gets back its lost apparatus
of civilisation the prospect is that one famine will
follow another till the nation becomes small enough
to be famine-proof, as a wandering tribe is famine-
proof because it can go to food if food doesn't
come to it. A nation which allows itself to be
dragged that road by a handful of adventurers is
not really getting help from other nations which,
by offering palliatives, disguise the nature of the
road.
The Lament of a Little Australian.
The importers’ side of the case:—
The remarks of Burciiell, M.H.R., as to the grow-
ing of bananas in Westralia (B. 27/10/’21) ( , are not
true in certain respects. He is reported to have
said:—•
Three weeks ago the people whose names have
been mentioned approached me in connection with
their scheme for growing bananas near Carnarvon,
where the State Government has granted them from
5000 to 10,000 acres. They realise that the imposi-
tion of an increased duty on bananas compels them
to focus their attention on locally-grown fruit.
They are getting their plants from Queensland, and
Westralia will have a banana industry in two years
if the Commonwealth Government helps.
Presumably this refers to McCorkill, Ltd., and
Simper, Ltd. Neither of these companies approached
Mr. Burchell at any time in this matter. The
State Government has not granted 5000 to 10,000
acres (or for the matter of that a single acre) to
either company or to any individual member of
either company. No arrangements have been made
to purchase a single banana-plant in Queensland.
The facta are that a syndicate has been formed
to investigate the possibilities of growing tropical
fruit in the Nor’-West. It includes only four share-
holders of McCorkill, Ltd., and none of the share-
holders of Simper, Ltd. These four, in their private
capacity, with other members of the syndicate' each
applied for 100 acres near Carnarvon, and the syn-
dicate approached the State Ministry for a subsidy
to establish a tropical culture plantation. This
application was refused. No reply has been received
as to the proposed land purchase. The syndicate
then applied to the Commonwealth Ministry for
assistance to blaze the track. This also was re-
fused, and that is where the matter stands to-day.
In regard to the imposition of a duty of Id. per
lb. on bananas, under the most favorable condi-
tions this represents between 3d. and 4d. per
dozen on the fruit sold to the public. The
north-west coast cannot be supplied with bananas
grown in Queensland —indeed, almost the only fruit
DEUTSCHLAND UBER SHIMINEYS.
“Made in Germany-Cheap Toys in London.—London, November 25.—German toys are being re-
tailed at below pre-war prices. Meanwhile thousands of British toy-makers, including ex-service men
who learnt the trade after the war, are unemployed. Retailers are buying pre-war half-guinea jointed
dolls that open and shut their eyes for 10d., as compared with 5s. in 1913.”
FITZ VON CLAUS (late of the Zeppelin fly-by-nights) : " Dese pig vide shimineys are
jusdt der ting for Farder Crismus! Vot you tink? Hein?"
available at a reasonable cost comes from Java. To
the settlers battling to open this vast empty space
the new duty is a real hardship. The Queensland
banana, as supplied in Westralia, is a very inferior
article at the best of times; a large percentage of
the fruit is rotten down the centre, although it ap-
pears to be perfectly good until broken open. To-
day bananas are still being imported from Java,
but the poorer members of the community are not
able to purchase this valuable and delicious fruit.
The imposition of this excessive duty is another
instance of the callous indifference of politicians
of Eastern Australia to the needs of the sparsely-
populated West. The passing of such legislation in
the interests of one part of Australia to the detri-
ment of another is not in the best interests of the
community. If either the Federal or State or both
Governments assist there appears to be no reason
why W.A. should not have bananas growing commer-
cially within its boundary in about two to three
years. In the meantime the people of this State
must depend on the Java product, and no increase
in the duty should be imposed on Westralia until a
proper supply is obtainable.
Leaving Bubchell to attend to the charge
of misrepresentation, which is his business
entirely, The Bulletin merely remarks that
the angry importing gentleman has made
out an excellent case for high Protection.
On his own showing Westralia can, in a
few years, become independent of both Java
bananas and the maligned but superior
Queensland article, and acquire a valuable
industry in the process, with the assistance
of the Commonwealth Government. And
what better assistance could there be than
the penny duty ? Without such assistance
how could the industry get born or be
nourished in its struggling infancy?
The Possibilities of Politics.
The greatness and the comparative insig-
nificance of the Russian famine both stand
■out in the official reports. The latest state-
ment from the Scene of Horror says that
£8,000,000 a month is required to feed the
skeletons till next harvest. That is to say,
the 70 or 80 miliion people who are not in
the affected area need to find in cash or
credit half-a-crown per head per month for
the next few months. A country which has
saved three or four times the amount by
stopping interest on the public debt, and has
eliminated the royal family, the landlord
and the capitalist, should do a little thing
like that “on its head.” Australia pays
nearly £l2 per human per annum in taxes,
and an addition of £1 each to its burdens
is now called for almost every year. It
finds the money, too, notwithstanding that
it is still waiting for the blessings of Soviet
government. Only a year or two ago 85
per cent, of the N. S. Wales wheat crop
was a failure. The harvest left 60 per
cent, of the State’s population breadless—
-not a mere 20 per cent, as in Russia. Yet
no one thought of famine and doing a perish
in the streets. There were reserves from
the previous year. There was money and
credit and a Government with some sem-
blance of capacity. So in a big State which
wanted 12,000,000 bushels to fill its stomach
and had a little over 4,000,000 to fill with,
there wasn’t even a noticeable rise in prices.
There have even been famines that spread
all over Australia, but people were too busy
to make a tragedy of them. It is a custom
to speak slightingly of politics as a useless
game, but a good Government can make para-
dise out of poor materials —can even fish up
a rich country from the bottom of the sea
as the Dutch did. A rotten one can make
hell out of anything, as the Turks did in
Mesopotamia and as the Sovieteers have
done and are doing in what used to be the
granary of Europe.
From an old Papuan official: —
The recent assertion of W. M. Hughes that the
flogging of natives. in eXrGermaq New Guinea was
due to their interference with white women falls
cold on the ears of anyone who knows anything of
the Western Pacific native. It has always been an
axiom among white men in New Guinea, the Solo-
mons, etc., that white women are entirely safe
from improper overtures on the part of the native
population. This not because of any excessive
tendency to virtue in the native, but because from
the day of puberty promiscuous association with
the unmarried of the . other sex is one of his
customs. I say unmarried advisedly, for once a
lady becomes a purchased wife she is supposed to
give up promiscuity. As regards the single young
ladies, I am sure that everyone who has studied
Island customs in this respect will bear me out. I
could fill columns 'of The Bulletin with an account
of the sex-practices of one Papuan tribe alone, and
though these vary in infinite detail among the many
mixtures which make up the population, the rule I
have stated holds good for all; there is little or
no restriction before marriage. And that makes for
the immunity of the white sinabada.
Among those native peoples who. enjoin absti-
nence on the part of the youth of both sexes, for
military or other reasons, matters stand on a
different footing. Among the great African races,
the Zulus, Basutos, Swazis and the lesser Kaffirs,
perfect continence was enforced by the most fearful
penalties. T’Chaka, the Zulu, made infraction a-penal
offence until the man had done a certain period of
active military service, and this custom was imitated
by others. Though the military service of the old days
has passed away, the rigid old laws still prevail
in the native territories, despite that missionary teach-
ing is having its effects. That is why every white
woman in territory bordering the big native pro-
tectorates of South Africa knows how to use fire-
arms. It can be truly said that the removal of the
Boer woriian from the veldt to the concentration
camps saved those women and children far more
horrors than they ever experienced in those camps.
I know, because in 1901 I was with an M.I. regi-
ment which escorted a huge ox convoy along the
Swazi border tp remove the women and children
from the farms. I have a lively remembrance of
their gratitude, and the average Boer vrow or
meisje had little love for the “khakis” otherwise.
It is improbable that the occupation of German New
Guinea by my countrymen has so utterly changed
the generations-old attitude of the Western Pacific
native to this question. I prefer to believe that
Hughes either doesn’t know what he is talking
about, or that he knows something he isn’t choos-
ing to talk about.
“0.K.” calls for “intermediary” hospitals:
A member of the Vic. Assembly lately reminded
the Government that “there should be an intermediary
institution between the public and the private hospi-
tals.” Not one but several of such institutions, and
large ones at that, are required for the moderately
poor in Melbourne alone —reasonable private hospi-
tals, endowed by the Government, if necessary, where
patients would be spared the publicity of the gratis
institution and the plundering of the other sort. As
things go at present, public hospitals, based on charity
and intended only for the needy sick, provide beds
for many patients who would gladly pay, or could be
compelled to pay, two or three guineas a week for
their board, lodging and attendance elsewhere. The
Salvation Army, with its “Bethesdas,” set the model
years ago, but the State Governments thus far have
done nothing towards meeting the demand. The
medical custom of ordering, patients into a private
hospital has become of late years an awful infliction
on the finances of numberless families where poor
income is saddled with poor health. Every private
hospital is, in the first instance, backed by a doctor,
or several of them, whose business interests require
a handsome provision of patients. Therefore the
surgeon jumps at any decent excuse for packing a
surgical case off to his favorite home of invalidism,
and the physician finds reason why his case should
also be retired. So the number of private institu-
tions grows apace, and the cost of being sick becomes
more than ever burdensome upon unwealthy Victims.
One great objection to the further growth of the
private-hospital system is its tendency to keep
patients in bed when they would be better out of it.
For the majority of the boarders in these cold, de-
pressing places of rest there is far too much of the
good thing. Boarders are kept in bed because it
makes them think they receive more for their money
than if they were getting up and bathing themselves
and taking their meals in a dining-room. It suits
the establishment to impress its supporters by dis-
couraging their natural desire for exercise. The
amount of bluff, stuff and nonsense incidental to the
treatment is known only to those who have suffered
much of it. And the charges exacted are exorbitant,
as a rule.
In the ease of the more-spacious and best-appointed
homes of humbug the expensiveness is subsidised, so
to speak, by a select clientele of overfed plutocrats,
who treat the place as a rest-home for shattered
nerves, and a sanatorium for the unsober. Such hos-
pitals will always have their noses in the air, but
others will reduce their tariff when intermediary in-
stitutions are established for the benefit of the sick
“middle-class.” The need for them is urgent. The
strain on public-hospital resources is excessive
because people of small means claim the accommoda-
tion due only to persons of no means to speak of.
And the results of existing private-hospital treatment
are mostly unsatisfactory because there is a sad lack
of intermediary competition.

POLITICAL
POINTS.
THE LADY WHO WAS RUN DOWN.
“Mr. Lang, Treasurer of N. S. Wales, announces
that to meet a certain deficit the income-tax will be
increased to produce another £2,000,000.”
“Well, now that you've run me head over
heels in debt with your extravagances
and nearly killed yourself, I hope you'll
mend your ways.”
“Dear, don't scold me. Just bring me some
champagne—and I think I could pick
a chicken-bone.”
From the Federal Gallery:—
Now there is a rift in the Federal Country party.
There have been some warm caucus meetings, and
though the proceedings haven’t reached the stage
of splints and sticking-plaster, results are visible in
the divided votes and the resignation of Gregory as
deputy-leader. The trouble has arisen mainly over
some members’ readiness to help the Government into
recess, but there is also criticism of the affable
leader, who, whilst demanding reductions in the
Defence Estimates, allowed £200,000 to be allotted
for Canberra without a murmur. Page was severely
heckled by a returned-soldier deputation on this
matter the other day, and he will find it hard to
justify his position to two or three of his colleagues.
He is not an inspiring leader. Actually he has the
confidence of only the other novices in the party, to
whom his political innocence is more acceptable
than the sophistication of the experienced McWil-
liams and Gregory. These two abide in the Corner
because it is only from there they can indulge in
free criticisin of the Government, while still flinging
bricks at the Opposition; and they judge that that
is how their constituents feel about the main parties.
The trouble for which the Sydney Labor
aldermen had been stormily looking fell on
them last week. There were 13 of them
when it started, but only nine were collected
after the rout. Doyle, M.L.A. for Balmain,
was among the missing; the municipal am-
bitions of Buckley, M.L.A., were blighted
once more, and Lambert, Lord Mayor and
M.H.R., scraped in by five votes. To some
extent the Dooley Government was on trial
as well, and the result will stiffen its deter-
mination to hang on to its princely salaries
as long as the law and Levy will allow.
By way of gratifying the ambition of
every Labor Treasurer to leave his country
deeper in debt to the capitalist than he
found it, Lang, of the Ma State, raised loans
amounting to £12,556,230 last year and got
through £15,485,000, the “vigorous public
works policy” costing £8',000,000. As a re-
sult of this Jubilee'Plunger finance his in-
terest bill has soared £703,000 in a twelve-
month. In 1920-21 it was £7,169,000, or,
roughly, £3 7s. 6d. per head. That of Vic-
toria, which has been reasonably provident,
was £3,875,350, or £2 10s. 7d. per head. On
June 30 Victoria (population at census
1,531,529) owed £94.738,000, of which Lon-
don creditors hold only 41 per cent.; whereas
a succession of financial profligates had
raised the Ma State debt (population
2,099,763) to £168,777,000. Encyclopaedias
couldn’t say more about the madness of the
policy which The Bulletin has denounced
all its days.
A short Act has been run through S. Aus.
Parliament, almost without comment, to give
Cabinet Ministers better pay. Barwell
claimed that the present wage is the lowest
“not only in Australia but probably in the
world.” Five payments of £lOOO are allowed.
Long ago it was found convenient to take in
a sixth honorary colleague, and in course of
time, as he did as much work as the rest,
it became the custom for them to divide with
him; so latterly they have had only £833
each. The Premier gets just the same —
again the only place in the world, Barwell
thought. In future he will receive fISOP.
the others £1250 each. Incidentally, it was
mentioned that as much as half-a-century
ago the Attorney-General used to be paid
£l4OO.
There are Napoleons whose passing from
the stage alters the course
of history, and N.S.W.
Speaker Dan Levy is in the
category. By lending him-
self to the party he w r as
elected to oppose, and thus
taking a vote from the
party he was elected to sup-
port, he makes all the
waste, violence and corrup-
tion of the present regime
possible. It is calculated
that he has already cost the
State £10,006,000 in money
and a great deal more in
disgrace. It is also calcu-
lated that if any inscrutable
Providence caused him to
be struck by lightning out-
side the synagogue any
Saturday morning it might
easily prevent the loss of
another £10,000.000. A
nervous man might in such
circumstances feel as if
there was a price on his
head, but there is none of
the hunted look of a lion in
a den about Daniel, and the
hand he extends once a month for the 30
pieces of silver doesn’t shake.
The latest favorite for the vacancy in the
Hughes Cabinet is Richard Foster, M.H.R.
for Wakefield (S.A.), the idea being that
his appointment would placate the Liberal
wing of the S. Aus. Nationalists, which is
threatening to break away and start in oppo-
sition to the National Labor crowd repre-
sented .by Poynton.
From the N.S.W. Gallery:—
Though the Labor caucus could keep Greg. McGirr
out of the Premiership, it can’t keep him out of the
limelight. Wherefore a distracted caucus is sitting
with a wet towel round its head pondering over a.
Bill to Propel G. McGirr into the Background. But
no progress has been made with the measure, and
McGirr goes on his way wearing a broad grin.
Between Premier Dooley and the McGirr faction a
fierce struggle is in progress. Dooley, though he
has a majority in the party of ten or a dozen, sees
no humor in the proceedings, for McGirr sets his
traps with almost devilish cunning. One is con-
cealed in the Basic Wage Bill. By this measure
McGirr proposes to make £4 ss. per week the
statutory wage for all adult male workers and A. 2 3s.
the wage for females, thus circumventing the Board of
Trade and Arbitration Courts. He knows the bill
will be thrown out by the Council. He knows, too,
that a majority of the caucus doesn’t like it. But
he knows that this majority is too scared to kill
the bill in caucus, and that he can force every
member of the party to at least make a show of
supporting it in the Assembly. Threatened by the
caucus majority the other day McGirr replied:
“Very well. You kill this and I will kill every one
of you by handing to the A.L.P. Executive a list
of names of those who will not support me in getting
£4 ss. a week for the workers of this State.” And
with this hanging over them they bowed their head
to the bluff, while Greg, scampered off to the
Assembly and turned "more limelight on himself.
His object? Well, apart from the illumination of
G. McGirr, mainly vote-catching. He reckons upon
showing the party outside that while he has tasty
joints to offer the proletariat—6s. a week for the
kids and £4 ss. for dad —Dooley has an empty
cupboard. And, to give him his due, he is showing
it to some purpose.
Most of the streets of Sydney city are
none too wide, and some are so crooked that
a tramcar breaks in two if it goes round
a corner suddenly, and they can’t stand any
extra or artificial unloveliness. Yet, thanks
to the Tammany Council’s 44-hours-per-week
system, city thoroughfares remain un-
cleansed all Saturday and Sunday, and (as
the scavenging staff lias such big
arrears of germs and debris to over-
take when it resumes work) many
of them are unswept on Monday
also. All the advocates of a clear
day’s drinking and pony-racing on
Saturday profess that knocking off
one-twelfth of the working time
doesn’t reduce the output, which
statement is an insult to the human
understanding. It reduces Syd-
ney’s output of cleanliness by a
sixth and in places by a third—and
the plague is in the offing. Yet
the partial cleaning of dirty Syd-
ney under the new system costs
about £40,000 a year more than the
whole cleaning of a less-dirty Syd-
ney did a short time ago.
Treasurer Lang’s new income-
tax scheme for the extraction of
another two millions from the
N.S.W. taxpayer suggests that
there is something specially rotten
about the dual taxation system. As
things stand there are two taxing
authorities each with power to take
from the taxpayer all he has got,
even though the other fellow may
have taken it already. They can
take it by the same methods —not
that it signifies much to the taxee
what the methods are. Each pro-
fesses not to know that the other
fellow exists, so remonstrance is
wasted. The Australian people tied
themselves in this knot, and no one
can untie them except themselves.
The Civic Reform party having won a
victory in the Sydney Municipal Council
elections, it can’t make a better start than
by locking up the grog cupboard at the
Town Hall and putting away the cigars.
It isn’t the Labor Lord Mayor Lambert’s
fault that the place has become full of
whisky-blossoms. The practice of making a
free-and-easy loafing club of it had been
growing for years. Reform will come a lot
easier in an atmosphere with more business
and less booze in it.
The State’s outlook having improved, the
South Aus. Parliament, in its closing hours,
doubled its own salary. But there is no
suggestion of Grab about the matter, the
electors having endorsed the idea at the last
general election, when it was a plank in the
platform of each party; in fact, the Labor
party talked of £5OO instead of the £4OO
now adopted. The figure has stood at an
absurd £2OO, for both Houses, since first
introduced away back in ISB7, wages out-
side having very nearly trebled meantime.
The main features of the brief debate were
that Hussey, a new member of the Assem-
bly and greatly onnosed to the increase, was
compelled to withdraw the remark that
“members of this House are anxious to get
all the cash they can,” though only a hypo-
crite would snvc'est that ; t isn’t true of a
great number of them; that Tossell made
an unpopular but nevertheless wise sugges-
tion to balance the increase in pay bv cutting
down the number of seats: and that Tassie
in the Leg. Council had a shot at abolishing
payment altogether instead of increasing it.
The consuming desire of the N. S. Wales
Labor party to drag George, Georgeson be-
fore the Pring Commission to explain his
transactions in war wheat was grnt’fied last
week. But the result was disappointing, for
Georgeson couldn’t (or wouldn’t) rememb°r
anything about wheat. Almost the only
point on which his memory wasn’t a blank
was that lie had paid the election expenses
of Cann, present N.S.W. Minister of Mines,
when that gentleman stood for the Reps, in
1910. Prom Cann immediately came a hot
denial and an offer to give evidence on oath.
Holders of certificates in the 1915-16 pool
want the inquiry continued for other rea-
sons. They refuse to be put off with the
official explanation that they have been over-
paid : they point out that they are to receive
Id. per bushel less than the amount realised
in Victoria. At the beginning of November
their scrip was saleable at 4d. or thereabout
per busli d, and the collapse occurred a week
or so before the overpayments were an-
nounced, and they want to know why. So it
looks as if the Wheat Commission will be
as endless as Edmunds’s study of the 1917
railway strike —and as useless, maybe.
In N. S. Wales the Government is so con-
cerned about mothers that it proposes to pay
them for having babies and rearing them;
but so far it hasn’t shown any interest in
the fact that an untrained and bibulous old
Sairey Gamp may attend —and even tout for
attendance —in midwifery cases. The num-
ber of deaths from puerperal sepsis is very-
high in the State;' and almost always the
slovenly attendant is responsible. There are
some votes in paying women for 1 their babies ;
there are none in saving mothers’ lives by
ruling out the untrained and ignorant mid-
wife.
Elphinstone, the slim M.L.A. who has left
the Queensland Nationals, is in the mud. In
response to a challenge of the daily press
that wanted to know why he didn’t resign
and put the matter to the electors, Elphin-

stone alleged that he really did desire to
consult his masters, but on appealing to
the Minister he had been informed that,
owing to the confusion of boundaries due
to recent redistribution and rearrangement,
the thing was practically impossible. Then
Premier Theodore stepped forward and told
the public that the eloquent M.L.A. could
have a by-election if he wanted one: in
fact, such a thing was specially provided
for. As the Nationalist organisation was
preparing to run a candidate in case it got
the opportunity, Theodore saw the chance of
slipping a man in and so raising his majo-
rity from one to two. If the Country-
National Ivilkenny-cat fight goes on it may
yet save Theodore’s bacon.
The report on the Government meatworks
at Wyndham (W.A.) shows that butchering
bullocks to make a slaughtermen’s holiday
comes expensive. In 19l9—and the slump
in dead cow hadn’t arrived then —9281 cattle
were killed at a loss of £48,973, or £o ss. 6d.
per head. Next year 18.495 beasts were
assassinated at a loss of £136,454 —£7 7s. 6d.
per head. This year the works have been
closed down, and it is anticipated that the
non-working expenses will amount to
£140,077, or about 9s. per, head —of popula-
tion this time. If business is resumed in
1922, the deficit, it is reckoned, will work out
at £139.750, or £4 13s. 2d. per head. But
inasmuch as “the general manager candidly
admitted to the select committee that he
could not see daylight in making the under-
taking a pavable proposition for many years
to come,” there is a fair prospect that the
lizard and the crocodile will keep the works
where Scaddan gloried and drank deep—
albeit Scaddan’s tipple was never harder
than ginger-ale.
THE HOPELESS QUEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Premier and Deficiency were walking hand in
hand ;
The Premier sadly wept to see such quantities of
sand.
“If this were only pelf,” he said, “oh my, it would
be grand!”
Then quoth Deficiency: “My lord, why gaze upon
me so?
’Twas that old scoundrel Policy that brought me
down so low.”
“Tut, tut,” the Premier quickly said, and dropped
a tear of woe. *
They met old Ways and Means. Said he: “What ails
you, friends, this day ?”
Your eyes arc sunken and your hair is very, very-
grey. ”
Said both: “We seek young Surplus; have you seen
him round this way?”
The Premier and Deficiency, with Ways and Means
as well,
Went searching in the forest, in the valley and the
dell.
But oh, it was a hopeless quest, and darkness
round them fell.
And as the yellow moon arose, and as the stars
shone out,
T'hey saw a dame who measured very many yards
about;
And she was old Extravagance and she was wond-
rous stout.
“We seek young Surplus, madam,” said the Premier
to the dame.
Extravagance shrieked loud with glee; said she, “A
sorry game! ,
The dust of Surplus lies within a grave without a
name.”
Deficiency was joyful, and he danced upon the beach.
Poor Ways and Means felt ill at ease and went
away to bleach ;
The Premier toddled home to make another little
speech.

Fi‘oin whatever angle the latest figures are
regarded they are remarkable: in both
branches a record growth of income, a very
favorable mortality rate and record addi-
tions to funds. Costly though the war was
to the life offices while it lasted, it has
proved their greatest agent: it impressed
upon uninsured the value of a life, policy,
and the abnormal conditions which it created
have, in addition, facilitated policy-getting.
Probably never before has business been writ-
ten with such ease, and even the youngsters at
the game have made surprising collections.
The T. and G. in its latest report puts
its experience in this way: ‘‘The society has
completely doubled itself in the past five
years,” But the greatest improvement is
ndt where it should be: Ordinary income is
£lB6 where it was £lOO in .1916, while
Industrial revenue is £236 where it was
£lOO five years ago. The greater number
of new policy-holders have gone into the de-
partment in which they get the poorer deal;
and that doesn’t apply only to this office.
In the T. and G, almost 355. gdes ■in
expenses in the Industrial branch for every
£1 spent by the Ordinary. It is unbeliev-
able that ’in a nation of savings-bank
accounts a society, like this should have in
force 343,914 Industrial policies and only
78,‘112 Ordinaries. The Bulletin can only
conclude that the advantages to be gained
by taking a policy in a department in which
premiums are payable at an office quarterly,
instead of to a collector every few weeks,
are not made clear to the insuring public.
It looks like bad salesmanship, the. public
being prevailed upon to take an inferior
article in the interests of the salesman.
Of course, the Industrial policy is not
such a poor proposition as? it used to be.
Sixteen years ago more thaii half of the
Industrial income of this mutual office went
in exes. This shows how the cost rate in
the two departments has moved over many
years:—

The Ordinary expense rate was unusually
high last year, not so much because, as in
other businesses, operations have become
more costly—and, incidentally, insurance-
prices have not been increased during the
abnormal period—but chiefly for the reason
that an unusually large volume of new busi-
ness. which is always expensive to get, lias
been put on the books. It :.is not possible to
tell with any accuracy how much the new
business is costing, but as a basis of com-
parison The Bulletin’s custom is to allow
7 p.C. as the 'cost of renewals and charge
the balance of exes, against first premiums.
On this figuring the year’s £111,459 of new
premiums cost £79,600. or 71 n.c„ which was
the same as for 1920 but several points
higher than a couple of years ago. The T.
and G.’s new-business cost is much lighter
than that of many other offices.
Ordinary claims are back to pre-war level;
in the Industrial branch there has been a
further decline in the proportion of pay-
ments to premium income : —•

The flood of new business has, of course,
been partly responsible for the smaller per-
centages, and that applies in particular to
the Industrial department. A feature of the
new business —and one which, incidentally,
tends to keep costs down —is the increased
cover sought nowadays. Last year’s 15,365
new Ordinary policies assured millions-
odd, an average of £193 per policy. That
was £lB more than for the previous year,
and £73 better than the pre-war average.
Last year there was a further improve-
ment in the rate of interest earned: —
Interest Earnings p.c. of Average Funds.
1910 .. £4 10 6 p.c. | 1918 .. £4 19 9 p.c.

1917 .. 417 6 „ [ 1921 . . 5 6 7 „
Compared with pre-war times every £lOO
of funds is earning 14s. Id. p.a. more, and
on last year’s average funds that meant
about £30,000. Interest earnings are a big
item; premiums last year were £1,194.078:
interest and net rents contributed £228,443.
The extra harvest from investments as the
result of abnormal conditions is going a
long way towards making good the losses
which tlie life offices sustained in the war.
In fact, the prospects of continued dear
money give every indication that ultimately,
instead of the life offices being out of pocket
by the war, they will actually have profited
in cash besides having had their connections
widened. Twelve months ago actuary Jack-
son’s investigations permitted the T. and G.
to pay bonuses on the pre-war scale, and
this year the dose is repeated. In the Ordi-
nary’branch £79.196 is being applied to the
purchase of reversionary bonuses (£6090
for 1920 and £35,998 for 1919) and £36,339
is split up in the Industrial branch (£28.794
for 1920 and £23,157 for- 1919). These dis-
tributions provide further evidence of the
advantages of the Ordinary over the Indus-
trial policy : the latest Ordinary bonuses
were 18 p.c. on premium income; the Indus-
trial 4.8 p.c.. ....
Funds now total £4.643,746; assets, how-
ever, are half a million more. The Society
has plunged heavily into Commonwealth
loans, and has made itself a debtor to the
extent of about to get the gilt-
edged stuff. Altogether Government and
municipal securities now total £3,702,283.

Though the jam industry has had a very
rough passage, Henry Jones’s co. pays its
usual 12§ p.c. But—“the directors wish
to make "it quite clear that a considerable
portion of the current year’s income has
been drawn from the accumulated reserves
set aside in previous years by the subsidiary
cos.’’ That confirms the suspicion The
Bulletin had that the parent co. was not
disclosing anything like the full extent of
the profits earned by the string of factories
it controlled. ' Henry Jones Co-op. is a hold-
ing co. only and stews no fruit on its own
account: it owns shares and “interests” in
various factories and timber-mills through-
out the Commonwealth and in S’Africa,
California and England, and its income is
made up wholly of divs. from those cos. and.
interest from its own surplus funds which
were invested in War Loans. That the
earnings of the subsidiaries were larger than
the profits passed on to this co. was made
fairly obvious by some of the parent’s
balance-sheet movements. In 1919 Henry
Jones Co-op. had advanced its family
£37,008; a year later, apparently so that
the parent could extend its interests, the
subsidiaries had lent it £172,202. The
entry has since grown to £216,249. In
addition the directors now admit that the
subsidiaries have also passed along cash- —
not wholly profit earned during the past year
—to enable the parent co. to pay the usual
12J p.c. Considering the bad knocks which
preservers throughout the world experienced
during the period—old-established English
cos. as well as several of the younger local
ones went to the wall—the Henry Jones
family has apoarently come through very
well. Except that the cash which has been
passed on indicates that the family,is well
nourished, the Henry Jones co.’s accounts
are no guide whatever to the actual health
of the widely-spread business. All that can
be ascertained is that the group is not quite
so strong as it w..s 12 months , ago owing , to
the tafining of reserves to feed the parent.
And the future is not at all certain.
Production in the Commonwealth hav-
ing far exceeded local demands the co.
has had to nurse overseas markets, and
sales have been restricted by high 'pro-
duction costs, partly due to dear sugar, though
these jam cos. have been getting their supplies
for much less than the general public. Paid
capital is £732,756 and reserves £169,021.
At October 31 only £3BB was owing apart
from the advances made by the subsidiaries.
Assets consisted of £1,107,778. of shares and
interests in one pile, £65,500 of War Loan
and £94 of book debts.

A feature of the Colonial Mutual Fire nowa-
days is the way in which shareholders fasten
to profits. Not a penny of new money has
been introduced into this office for many
years, but, £200,000 of reserves having been
capitalised, the 121 p.c. div. is 371 p.c. oh
the capital of a dozen years ago. There is
only one other Australasian office of any
importance in which proprietors get their,
teeth so deeply into disclosed surpluses. The
apparent profit for the past year before
dropping £2OOO into a staff superannuation
fund was £48,497, and 77.3 p.c. of it has
gone to shareholders. The proportion of
profits distributed by Australasian offices at
their last balances, was as follows: —

The only office justified in making such
fat distributions as those of the Colonial
Mutual would be one possessing reserves
considerably in excess of those _ generally
deemed necessary, and whose business was
steady and select. Twelve months ago this
one had funds equal to 161 p.c. of the pre-
mium income of the financial year ended
September, 1920. But during the past year
there was a record increase of business:
nearly £75,000 more premiums were har-
vested than in 1920. The ratio of funds to
net premiums has consequently dropped to
below 140 p.c., 10 points less than the gen-
erally-accepted standard proportion. If
business continues to expand the Colonial
Mutual will find itself in the same position
as did the Mercantile Mutual, which, in-
stead of having more than ample funds pro-
vided by accumulated profits, had to get in
■new capital from shareholders.
The latest entfy in this comparison helps
to throw additional light on the relationship
of profits to earnings:—

A heavy loss-rate, due chiefly to marine
operations, was experienced last year; so
the very much larger business (gross pre-
miums were £532,812 compared with
£370,633 for 1920), though handled at
smaller cost, proved slightly less, profitable.
The underwriting surplus was £24,56')
(£25,906 in 3920), and £23.937 was earned
by investments. After paying divs. and put-
ting £2OOO aside for the staff, not quite
£9OOO was available for reserves. A4O p.c.
provision for unexpired risks on the £75,000
of additional business alone necessitated that
reserve containing £30,000 more than was
necessary 12 months before. At Sep-
tember, 1920, the so-called re-insur-
ance fund —the reserve which, theoreti-
cally, is the amount required to lay-
off all risks at a balancing-date should
an office suddenly decide to go out of busi-
ness—-represented 16 p.c. of net premiums;
the £lO,OOO recently dropped in (the £8996
margin between profits and dividends was
helped by about £lOOO from the P. and L.
balance from the previous year) made the
.reserve 15.4 p.c. of net premiums. And
that means that shareholders cannot con-
sider the £IOO,OOO of general reserves as
wholly their property. On the basis of 40
p.c. of net premiums being required for unex-
pired risks they could lay claim to only
£23,000 or so, the precise amount depending
on the class of risks handled, some business
not requiring a 40 p.c. provision. But the
past year’s additions to all reserves was far
short of the ■ extra backing required for the
additional business, and under those circum-
stances the year’s underwriting did not war-
rant the fat dividend. Still, funds equal to
140 p.c. of risks (as measured by premium
income) is not much below .the standard
proportion. The eo.’s position from the
viewpoint of policy-holders can be put an-
other way; funds total £451,700-odd.
slightly more than 24 times last year’s losses.
The 300,000 £1 shares are fully paid, so
there is no uncalled capital to fall back
upon—-not That the ‘‘Wild Cat” places much
faith in uncalled • capital for protecting
policy-holders.

Though not an ounce of copper was
smelted during the past six months —the
works shut down in December last year—
£l7,os2 fell into the working account: appa-
rently surpluses got from the realisation of
stocks at prices in excess of values at
which they had been included in the February
accounts. Though all the scattered mines
were in the hands of caretakers or pumping
staffs during the period, a little ore was d"n
out of the Duchess, which is now practically
exhausted. Operating exes, during the half
took £18,951, leaving the working loss of
£1899. Rents and interest gave £1713, and the
Federal Taxation Commissioner refunded
£7932, so, the Board having curtailed its fees
by half and made economies elsewhere, a profit
of £1283 resulted. However, depreciation
and an abandoned option demanded £11,878,
and the directors had to dig into the equalisa-
tion reserve for £10,595 to square off the
accounts. These changes have taken place
in the liquid position since the August, 1920,

down to market level. The stock entries of
six months ago evidently proved all thev
should have been: £200,000-odd of that
accumulation has disappeared, realisations
having given the small profit referred to.
Hampden-Cloncurry is still waiting for
substantial reductions in wages, freights and
geneial supplies’ to make a resumption
economically possible.” The directors ap-
parently cannot yet see daylight. Until cop-
per prices go up or costs go down, a re-
commencement is evidently not on the pro-
gramme. To make the most of existing con-
ditions Erie Huntley proposes to lift up to
100 tons per day from the Trekelano and
Answer mines. An accumulation of 25 000
tons of high-grade ore at grass, he says
would materially assist the position and
assure a regular supply of 200 tons per
day for the smelters immediately they are
bred. The estimate of ore reserves is as
follows: 62,000 tons containing 4920 tons
copper available for direct smelting (35 000
tons in the Trekelano and 20,000 in‘the
Hampden), and 7300 tons silicious ore con-
taining 3190 tons copper. There are 350,000
fully-paid £1 shares, and about 9s. per share
is in surplus liquid assets, which, now that
the big copper stocks have been successfully
unloaded, are a healthier-looking lot than
those of six months ago.

It all looks like a slide to ruin, unless more
cash shows up.; As it . is, capital has been
increased from £344,280 to £364,947 over
the period as the result of call-making.
Apart from the old' debenture liability of
£55,000, debts compare with those of a year
ago as follows :

Both deferred creditors and the bank are
secured by prior lien debentures, £lO,OOO
and £25,000 respectively, and as these take
precedence of the old issue of bonds they
look like having a firm grip on the show.
The shrinkage of debts, bv the way, has not
been due to calls paid by shareholders. The
bank had a hold on the copper stocks hung
up for treatment at Port Kembla. The
valuation stood at £142,657 in 1920, and at
at th e latest balance. But the job
»f wiping off debts with inethl lias been all
the harder because electrolytic is now £7B,
against £lll a year ago. That £33 a ton
difference has brought woe to the Cuthbert
household. More calls might be made to get
accounts square, for with 193.500 tons ore
proved containing 13,245' tons' copper, the
claims are too good to. let fall into the
lap of the Hampden, Mt. Elliott or anyone
else. Recoristraction would be the "best
move, but that would mean getting the hold-
ers of £55,000 of debentures to agree to a
pref. allotment and also raising cash to pay
off the bank and the prior lien debt.

Chairman Joe Palmer told the B. H.
Junction North meeting the other day that
at the metal prices ruling mining on that
show would not be possible with present
labor conditions, the price of coal and stores
and the high cost of smelting. So the co.
has secured exemption from labor conditions
at the Pinnacles and Junction North, and
the staff is down to a handful. Meantime a
proposal to shift part of the Junction North
mill to the Pinnacles, which it is reckoned
can be run at a profit on its own, is being
looked into. The Junction North crowd has
also come to the conclusion that an attempt
is being made to freeze it out at Broken
Hill. The Zinc Producers’ Association is
the chief target at which Junction North is
firing at present. At the meeting Palmer
read a letter from, the Z.P.A. to the effect
that estimates of zinc-concentrate produc-
tion from the various cos. to June 30 next
were in excess of the requirements of the
Board of. Trade contract, and consequently
there was little hope of disposing of any
the .Junction North might produce. The co.
had the same experience in 1918, when it
could not get an allotment of, sales for its
slime concentrates, though after conferences
with the Government representative the
Z.P.A. gave Junction North a preferential
allotment for a period. One of these days
there may be some straight talk about the
inner workings of some of the Broken Hill
associations. It would certainly be interest-
ing to get the affairs of the Associated Smel-
ters into public view.
Mt. Lyell’s output is showing signs of

The crude ore now won is roughly 16,000
tons per month, of which the mine
supplies 40 p.c. grading -4 p.c. copper; the
oaiance coming from the North JLyell and
averaging 6 p.c. On the crude output for
November this represents a copper content
• ur 0 tQnSj wllic K applied to the reported
yield of 534 tons, gives an extraction effi-
ciency of only about SO p.c., while it raises
the average smelter feed-grade to 5.74 p.c.
copper, which is a high average to maintain
on an ore feed 40 p.c. of whose bulk goes
P ni y i P-c. The incidence of the ore sort-
ing, crushing, flotation and nodulising plants
has made such a high feed-grade possible.
Compared with March, 1920, recoveries, cop-
per has improved 2.02 p.c. per ton smelted,
and silver .310 z., while gold shows a de-
crease of .0230 z., indicating a benefit of
treatment for the first two metals, and the
unsuitability of the new process for the
gold, the extraction percentage of which in
November was only about 50 p.c. At pre-
sent metal prices and labor costs the changed
process may not be as economically sound
as the old one.

Thefirst half of the plant of the Electro-
lytic Zinc. (Tas.) was put in operation re-
cently, and is absorbing 15,000 h.-p. from
the fepeek Hydro-Electric Department. The
plant is running satisfactorily, and with
spelter at £26 per ton the co. should about
square the ledger. The future is wrapped
up in theyprice of zinc; heavy overhead and
capital-redemption charges and a too-gener-
ous labor policy in the past will give the
co. plenty to worry over unless the market
keeps well above the £2O mark.

WiUiam Jamieson’s Blythe River iron-
show (las.) has bobbed up again. On the
last occasion John Higgins took it to the
Commonwealth Government for £lOO,OOO. Up
to that J time Speck Geologist Twelvetrees had
given 11,000,000 tons as the irreducible inini-
miim of ore in signt, but the Commonwealth’s
experts boiled the total down by millions.
That report, hard times and general antipathy
to the Commonwealth going into the busi-
ness put the damper on the sale. Now the
B. H. 1 rop. is giving £lOOO for an option with
easy rights of renewal. Even if it fails to
close, it is thus able to keep other people out
of possession. Jamieson and Wliitsitt with
some Tassies held the claims for long years
Keats and Tolhurst as co-optors.
iaonel Robinson and Clark were persuaded to
join, and there was a yarn that the Japs
and the Hhns secured interests. Whether
« Ji >e t, ue or not > K* s rather strange to
nnd the Prop, wad-ing in at a time when its
future is imperilled by competition from the
Belgian and Hun. The big Newcastle con-
cern, if it decides to take on the Blythe
River proposition, is to pay £50,000 in cash
or shares, the latter to lie valued on the
average market price during the three
months preceding the clinching of the deal.
If the Prop, takes over within two years all
option payments will contribute to 'the pur-
chase price. There are a half-million fully-
?, aid ,£i,-. sbares in the. B, ythe River co., so
the £50,000 would give 2s. per share.

to take over 5000 acres and hand 37,500 £1
shares, but no cash, to the vendor syndicate.
The public is offered 50,000 shares. A

posed. .

Scone (N.S.W.) is after oil. A local
syndicate has spent £3OOO, and, having at
640 ft. got. samples which it believes show
traces of oil, the Warden has been approached
for permission to enter private lands to con-
tinue the hunt. A co. with a nominal capi-
tal of not less than £lOO,OOO will be the next
move.

Another Westralian “oil concession” has
been placed on the market.' This' time the
public is invited to take shares in a co.
formed to acquire 50,000 sq. miles of mostly
sand and spinifex country “immediately
south of Erene.v, Oakes and Strevens areas.”
In this area, difficult of access, and stretch-
ing away to the S. Aus. border, oil has hot
so far been reported. The venture is purely
a “position” one, and the price asked for it
is in these circumstances ridiculous.
Vendors of the Okes-Durack Kimberley
oil concession have chipped a bit off their
terms. The cash consideration has been re-
duced from £17,500 to £15.000, of which
£7500 is payable on flotation and the balance
12 months later. In the prospectus 85.000
£1 shares were ottered to the public, and the
same number of paids were earmarked for
the vendors; but as only 50,000 shares were
applied for the vendors’ cut has for the time
being_been reduced to 50,000 shares. When
the 35,000 shares not applied for are taken
up by tiie public vendors are to come in on
a share-for-share basis.

W estralian Chamber of Mines has sub-
mitted a new log to the mining unions. The
present award, which gave the men more
than they expected and a fortnight’s annual
tottday to boot, expires on December 31, and
tlie Ghaniber now wants to reduce wages by
from 3s. to 4s. a day. The log provides for
& I—s. minimum and 17s. 6d. maximum
for skilled worke s. There is no mention
Of a fortnight's holiday. Thirty days are
given for a satisfactory settlement, failmg
Which the log will be referred to the Arbi-
tration Court. Meanwhile the Chamber
solemnly assures the workers that unless
wages are lowered to the standard fixed by it
the mining industry cannot last

The first operating report from Nawng
1 et, the Siamese tin show which A. J. King,
late of Kampong Kamunting, introduced,
is veiy cheering. The mine has been opened
out, and as tin unexpectedly showed up in
the overburden . the plant has been stopped
to eiect the tin-saving tables. So “fair t.n
returns are expected immediately.” The
centre of interest at present, however, is the
behavior of Powell’s pneumatic tailrace, a
iUaonland invention with which the area is
being worked.. This method combines the
forces of t* e jet as in ordinary sluicing and
of the vacuum it creates. The first run
has exceeded all expectations. Handling
gold dirt in Maoriland Powell’s costs aver-
aged id. per yd., but when the plant had
been enlarged and improved costs were got
down to -,d. In tin-land, howevu - , such low
costs were not expected, owing to the
extra labor necessary for the boxes, for
diessing and to handle the bulkier product,
tfut in the preliminary work Nawng Pet
xeckons it has beaten all previous tin per-
tormunces. A. J. King cables the “Wild
Cat :
Consider Nawng p e t elevating 49,000vd5. 82ft.

good things when tin-winning commences.
Incidentally, the Nawng Pot experience ex-
plains the optimistic-looking returns which
King anticipated (B. 24/11/’2l) from Huey
. °Jj another Siamese proposition which he
is floating.

Cap’n Miles is steering Deebook into

to a hold-up of 47 days to put in a new

renewals. All these items have carried the
weight of an adverse exchange rate. The
Deebook, holds 15,000 shares in the Ronpibon
extended, which it values at £24,450. There
is not going to be any half measures as to
what will happen at that show if costs don’t

Charters Towers some months ago was con-
sidered satisfactory, and the management
thereupon decided to go ahead with its own

Lord Mount Stephen, dead in Canada fit
.12, deprived the Dominion Government of a
heap of probate by handing over large por-
tions of his fortune to relations and friends
some years ago. A kind and genial old
party, he had some interest in Australia
through marrying a sister of the Rev. Plow
Kane, tvho was for a long time Chairman
of Directors? of the Colonial Mutual Life in
Melbourne. Plow Kane, a picturesque and
portly Anglican parsbn, was very proud of
having a peerage in the family. In fact,
next to his Colonial Mutual billet and his
hope of a Hereafter, the Mount Stephen
connection was his most absorbing topic.
He died some years ago in a rambling old
house at Brighton (VicA that was choked
to the roof with valuable curios and art
objects.

and got his commission before the S’African

the evacuation was given a camp command-

turned to Sydney later and was appointed
G.U. at George’s Heights, the quasi-hospital
camp from which invalid soldiers were either
discharged as unfit or drafted back to the
reinforcement camps. He was a disciplina-
rian and a keen soldier, but, unlike mest
regulars who have risen from the ranks, lie
was extremely courteous and sympathetic to
the warrior in embrvo, and every Digger
who crossed his path had a good word to
say of him.

\ ic. Premier Lawson is being forced into
the position of playing second fiddle to Pre-
mier Barwell (S.A,), the man with the
Irvinesque pose. Bar well led in the wheat
decontrol business, and Lawson followed.
Barwell stirred up things over arbitration,
and Lawson fell in behind. Then came the
Premiers’ Conference and its arbitration re-
solutions, which were supposed to be unani-
mous when Hughes gave them out. Barwell
woke up when he got a draft bill embodying
the resolutions and rejected it. Lawson had
an opinion- all ready from four counsel that
the States might be giving away something
for nothing, but \vhile he was nursing it Bar-
well spoke. And once more Vic.’s Premier
tailed after him. Barwell admirers are talk-,
ing of him as a future Prime Minister, and
Lawson has Federal ambitions, too.

Thomas Mulhall King, one of the founders
of the Queensland civil -service, is dead at
79. He began working for the Government
as a customs clerk in 1863, and when he
retired, in 1911, he had been nearly every-
thing. that was going—Collector of Customs.
Chief Inspector of .Distilleries, Auditor-
General, Under-Secretary of the Treasury
and Railway Commissioner. One of his

E. M. Brissenden, the djdrd-faced, shaven-
headed, monoeled Sydney K.C., who went to
the Great War as a private in 1910, is to
be a Lieut.-Colonel (with the new style of
Deputy Judge-Advocate General) in the
Army Legal Corps. Dr. Brissenden did not
waste much time in the 34th Battalion but
went presently on a Divisional Staff as eo’urts-
martial officer, in which capacity he did
valuable work. He accepted a District Court
Judgeship shortly after he was demobilised,
but threw it up to return to the Bar.
A trip to the United States as Australia’s

in quick succession—are these a prelude to
G. F. Pearce’s retirement from the Federal
Cabinet - .' 1 Some political gossips think so.
If the Cabinet applecart withstands all at-
tempts to upset it before the recess, Hughes
may display a willingness to bow out at least
two. colleagues. Then, with three Minister-
ships to give away, he might acquire new
merit.
The Clements will-case having wiped out

January, 1918, was granted the other day.
Under this the sister of the tonic man is to
receive approximately a quarter of the in-
come from the investment of the whole
estate, which is sworn at £112,243. The
estate is to be realised—Clements sold the
tonic business years ago—invested by the
Public Trustee in England, and, roughly, the
annual jncome is to be divided into 100
parts, 25 of which go to Miss Clements, 50
to other relations and friends, and 25-to the
Barnardo Homes, the Bluecoat School and
the Greycoat School (England 1. When the
life interests fall in the revenues are to
go to 20 charities in perpetuity, practically

. The new president of the X. S. Wales
Branch of the R. S. League, Lieut.-Col. Ver-
non, is as unlike his predecessor in most
respectfe as a man could be. He is an archi-
tect and a typical cavalryman, who served
with the Ist Light Horse in the Peninsula,
xoung, cheery and energetic, he w’as greatly
liked in the A.F.A. (4th" Divvy), to which
he transferred in Egypt,' and with which he
served in France. McDonald, his predeces-
sor, enlisted as a private in the days when
things were looking very Lad,- and served in
that capacity in Flanders, getting his com-
mission just as the war was ending. He is
elderly and grey-: serious, cautious, and very
sound, like the conscientious barrister he is.
He was a shrewd selection on the part of the
returned men, and as a yesult of two years’
hard work and wish guidance be has been
able to hand the League over to Vernon in a
more united condition than it ever was
before.
Though William Gibson, of the Foy and'

A'. JR . Troup, one of the best-known of
Australian accountants, senior partner of
Troup, Harwood & Co.i and for years a
director of the Queensland Insurance Co.,
died at Katoorhba a few days back. ' He had
for some time practically retired from his
profession.
Phil Sullivan, the Sydney solicitor who
died unexpectedly -this week, had political
aspirations once, and was in the NiS:\V.
Assembly as a Labor member for a term or
two. But it wasn’t what he expected it to
be, and he retired to settle down with "his
brother in a comfortable practice, largely in
the industrial courts: and there was hardly
a maritime matter in which he didn’t appear
on one side or the other.
A Sydney newspaper has been trying to
get records of all its employees who went on
active service. It was told that Captain
St. Croix (let us say), D.S.O. and bar and
the rest, had been selling papers on the
streets not so long before the war. But
none of the newsboys of his generation could
place him till a chance reference reminded
one of, them. “Ob, yes,” this one said, “I
remember him —but we always called him
Mudguts.”
An inquiry was made , lately through The
Bulletin for Herbert Palmer, one of the
oldest and ablest of Vi&. journalists, a small
pension from the Cominomvc.-i.lth Literary
Fund having been granted to him. It came-
too late. Palmer died at Brunswick (Vic.)
on November 27. For many, years he ran
the Imperial. Review, and" wrote practically
the whole of it : and it was good, thoughtful
stuff. A man of vast reading, he was, until
his health failed him a few years ago, a
valued contributor to Tile Bulletin—-
mostly on literary subjects and foreign
affairs.
The attempt to link South and North
Wesfraha by an aerial mail service began
tragically. Three machines started out
from Perth, and the first stage was completed
without incident. "But about 100 miles
north of Geraldton one of the mail-carriers
developed -engine trouble and had to land;
another nose-dived while circling above the
place of descent, and crashed. So two fine
young Australians—Fawcett, the pilot, and
his mechanic, Broad —lie in a mulga grave.
They were so keen on carrying out the
£30,000 contract, for which Norman Brear-
iey, their, leader, had Worked unweariedly

through a special course of training and
pledged themselves to abstain from smoking
and intoxicants. But a moment of tragedy
ruined everything.

THE KIDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With years of toil my hands are hard as horn;
My legs move slow as age puts on the skids ;
My head is bald where Time’s keen blade has shorn ;
But still I like the comp’ny of the kids.
Their tiny feet, just startin’ on the track,
Run round an’ keep me trottin’ here an’ there,
But first their little hands lift from my back
The burden of the swag of worldy care.
I join their magpie chatter, an’ my tongue
Forgets its rasp, an’ learns to lisp old rhymes ;
I play the games I played when I was young.
An’ hear again the sound of fairy chimes.
I make-believe the farm’s a Noah's Ark,
Filled up with play-toy horses, pigs an’ cows,
An’ cover with, a smile the crow’s-foot mark
That trouble brands on grown-up minds an’ brows.
If old folks lived -for ever an’ a day,
An’ kids ne’er came to laugh an’ dance an’ sing,
Old age would be a stubble-paddock grey
Where God ne’er dropped the slips to let in Spring.
The saucer eyes that stare in wonder-wide,
The ears that take the oldest yarns for new,
Were ours before we grew the tough old hide
That makes the simple joys of life so few.
We’re like old battered billies, black with rust;
We’ve travelled far an’ wide, an’ lost our lids ;
But once we shone, with love, an’ hope, an’ , trust,
Reflectin’ nature’s sunshine, like the kids,
There’s just one place where wisdom bows to truth,
Where strength an’ pride obey as frailty bids.
Where wrinkled age can snatch an' hour of youth,
An’ that is in the comp’ny of the kids.

“S.C.”: In 1918 when all England was
keen upon making tlie “Peace Christmas”
something to be remembered, I got an invi-
tation a country house near Ashford, in
Kent. The old people were giving a cele-
bration to their grandchildren who had
fought in the war; and the event curiously
illustrated the cousinship of the English-
speaking countries. The children of the old
folk had numbered 11, and only two had
remained in England. Of the grandsons
present three were members of the A.1.F.,
two were Maonlanders, two South Africans,
four Canadians, three Doughboys, one an
officer in charge of Jamaican troops, and
three were Tommies, while two others owned
a .home in the Argentine but had joined up
with English forces. All but the three in
the U.S.A. forces had lost brothers on the
fighting front; and it was an impressive
moment when the whole company, which in-
cluded everything from a colonel to a pri-
vate, stood to attention in memorv of the
dead.

“Bi” : The Digger again. Prior to the
card system of paying njilitary allotments the
Defence Dept, issued money orders payable at
post offices, and to guard against impersona-
tion the paying officer had to inquire the
name of the soldier on whose behalf the
money was remitted. During a rush of
these orders at one Melbourne office a lady
presented a maternity-allowance order for
fo and quite seriously the teller inquired:
Name of soldier, please?” He noticed his
error and just managed to splutter out an
apology before the storm broke.

. ; Even in pre-war days I had a
high regard for Australian characteristics as
typified in Aussies I met in M.L. while
cutting flax and falling bush. This feeling
was intensified in France, and among the
tilings I admired was Billjim’s wonderful cool-
ness. In 1916 we Maorilanders were lying in
Armentieres, the town being then in a fair-
ish state of repair. Just beyond Half-past
Eleven Square was a long, narrow estaminet
?n the ground floor of a three-storey build-
in £- P ac l ie d with khaki one noonday
when E ritz fluked a burst on the roof.
Nothing came down as far as we were
but a hellish noise and the plaster from the
ceiling. There was a general rush for the
door, in which the staff of the show ran
well. Seated at the same table as myself
was an Aussie sergeant, who, as soon as
the crash came, clapped his hand over the
top of his glass, waited until the dust had
partially subsided, and then drank his beer.
"Beer-ak”: Just after he had got to Lon-
don, and when he was a free-lance journal-
ist of no importance", J. M.
Barrie wrote a tiny book
which he called “Better
Ddud.” lie formed a Society
for Doing Without Some
People, and its members
gravely discussed the merits
(and otherwise) of various
public men, and decided
whether they should be got
rid of and (if so) how. A
man in our north-of-Vic.
township formed himself
lately into a S.D.W.S.P. on
his own account, and drew
up a list of the local people
he considered would be bet-
ter off the earth. Opposite
each name he noted the
reason for its inclusion.
Having made his little com-
pilation he started on the
practical side of the job by
blowing off the first victim’s
head in a very thorough
manner with the gentle-
own gun. He was
.making a bee-line across
country to the residence of
the second on the list when
Authority placed restrain-
ing hands upon him. The
local butcher was on the
index for supplying tough steak.
“Fraoch” : Recently on the Northern
Rivers (N.S.W.) I witnessed the cremation
of a Hindu —a most weird business. The
coffin was carried to a spot outside the town
by several of the departed’s countrymen, who
were followed uy many of the local white
inhabitants. The body was taken from the
box, placed on the ground and the skull split
open with an axe, presumably to ensure
death. Then large quantities of butter were
smeared over the corpse, and it was placed
on a wood piie, which was ignited. The
Hindu priest recited a burial service, and
after the corpse had been reduced to ashes
he sw r ept them un and placed them in a bag
for shipment to the Ganges. After that he
turned to the audience and in true Austra-
lianese remarked : “All over ; pinch off!”
* * * *
“Centurion”: A few days ago the last
British troops were withdrawm from South
Africa, the C.O. formally handing over the
keys of the Castle at the Cape, which was
the headquarters of the British garrison.
This ends a military occupation which has
not been broken, even if it has been con-
tested, since it was confirmed by the Treaty
of Paris in 1815. Since that day British
troops in South Africa pretty well earned
their oats in dozens of little wars against
blacks and whites; and now r the rooibaatje
the red-jacket hated by the Boers for over
a century, has gone, perhaps for good. To
many Australians the mention of the Castle
will recall memories. It was the official
NOW WE BOTH KNOW.
"After all, you’ll find the did friends the
dearest.”
"yes, perhaps; but you must expect the
young ones to he the most expensive!”
clink, and during the last Boer War the
special ambition of every Tommy town picket
was to capture an isolated Australian and
divide the spoils at the Castle: Just oppo-
site the venerable old bandbox was a pub
much affected by Aussies and Canadians,
and sometimes, when the overseas men
seemed few, the Tommies would try a cut-
ting-out expedition. A battle between a
strong picket of the 14th Hussars —the
‘ Ihrees About”—and a mixed mob of over-
seas men lingers pleasantly in the memory.
Australians carried a good deal of cash in
Capetown, for regular payment on the veldt
was unknown. Quite a lot of it must have
vanished in the Castle clink.
• • • .
“Velho”: Juries in Cue (W.A.) in the old
days seldom found anyone guilty, although I
remember - a fairly narrow shave one chap
had who was supposed to have burnt his
house down. The jury, failing to agree,
were locked up by Warden Dowley for the
night, and immediately started playing
poker. Towards morning one of them, Daw-
son/wliose luck was out, put in his last £1
with the remark: “If I lose this we’ll hanc
the blank!” B
* # * *
“Flaneur” : Every Australian who travels
is amazed at the.size of the marble baths
in the Hotel Sham-
rock at Bendigo
(Vie.). The only
place one has seen
baths like them is in
the Kursaal at Baden
Baden in Germany.
The story is that the
late bookmaker
Joseph, a big fat man,
while bathing in a tin
bath at the old Sham-
rock, then owned by
Heffernan and Crow-
ley. got stuck in it,
and the fire brigade
came along with block
and tackle and hauled
him out. By way of
revenge Joseph bought
the hotel, pulled it
down and re-built it
round the present gor-
geous marble baths, in
which even fat men
may wash in comfort.
“Machete”: The babble about Princess
Mary’s engagement to a mere peer having
broken “the archaic rule” that those of royal
blood must not marry outside the royal circle
is like so much other babble. Half-a-dozen
English sovereigns wedded outside the royal
caste. Henry IV. married Mary Bohun, who,
though she was the daughter of a great
TV USe ’ bl°°d of royal hue. Edward
. wedded Elizabeth Woodville, widow of
a slm Ple Lancashire gentleman of coat armor.

ine Parr, of whom only Jane could boast

“Moab” : “T.W.” (B. 24/11/’2l) is hardly
tair to the tvvo Jewish battalions in Palestine
I came across them in the Jordan Valley
and during.the advance east of the river
to 13s Salt and Amman in Sep-
tember, 18. They were re-
cruited about the middle of that
year, one having Lieut.-Col.
Margolin in command and the
other Lieut.-Col. Patterson, an
Irishman who years ago wrote
the , “Maneaters of Tsavo.”
ihe wags dubbed them “The
Jordan Highlanders,” and
added as a motto, “No advance
without security.” As a matter

ot Jewish soldiers who were
transferred from British regi-
ments in France and had been
through the real thing. In one
SL the batts - there were nearly
800 Yankee Jews who had
joined up for sentimental rea-
sons. Possibly “T.W.”
came across these,
hence his conclusion
that they “had no
English Jbeyond the
usual sentry calls.”
As to the taking of
Jerusalem, that smell-
ful city was captured
by the Tommies in
December, 1917. (It
was an infantry job, for the place is
2700 ft. above sea level, in the Judaean
hills.) As the Jewish battalions weren’t
even in existence then they can’t be very
seriously blamed for not having had a hand
in it.
“Sierra” : At our lodgings a new guest of
immense tonnage entered the lift, sat down
on the seat and folded his hands across his
stokehold. He remained in that attitude
after we had reached the ground floor. The
liftman looked at him reflectively for a
moment. “Say, mister,” he said, scratching
his head, “if you’re going to get out, you’ll
have to walk out. This isn’t a tip-dray.”
* * * *
“Big Aek”: I can see half-a-dozen aero-
planes displacing an army of officials at the
next census. On the morning Birtles re-
turned from his aerial tour of Centralia a
bystander asked him the population of Alice
Springs. “Can’t sav offhand,” he said, “but
if you count up the names on the fuselage
of the old ’bus you’ve got it. You’ll also
find that of Oodnadatta on the tail plane,
and Hergott Springs on the rudder.”
QUITE THE OPPOSITE, IN FACT.
MRS. BROWN : “Sorry to hear your friend
Simpson is leading such a loose life.”
BROWN : “Not at all —saw him last night
and he teas as fight as an oyster.”

Of all the minor woes that boast
The family name of nark—
Say leaking roofs, or burnt-up toast,
Or bull-ants in the dark,
Stubbed toes, soft corns, capsizing boat
Burst boots or toothache-pain—-
The narkiest nark of all I vote
Week-ending in the rain.
The drenching “burst” the landscape blots.
The keen “Antarctic” blows ;
You seek the rocks for shelter-spots
Well-soaked from head to toes;
Through dripping ledge the downpour creeps
And drives you forth again;
You turn a pessimist for keeps,
Week-ending in the rain.
Drenched cake turns tasteless to the bite ;
Your pals seem poor, dull blokes ;
In vain you struggle hard to light
Your hopeless, soggy smokes ;
Your best tart’s dampened hair uncurls,
She looks a real old jane;
And who fcould bother round with girls.
Week-ending in the rain?
The talk dies down ; from rain-wrecked hats
Each dully glares at each ;
A dismal stream of half-drowned rats,
We pour along the beach.
THE PUNISHMENT.
“Did your husband ever catch you flirting?”
“Only once.”
“What did he do?”
“ Varried me.”
We reach the hilt, mope round, look blue,
Stare out the streaming pane-—-
Oh, what in h —ll can people do

No sign df blue! With steady note
Pours on the hateful wet;

And leave without regret.

Anaf : Each year seems to see the medi-
al 11 practitioner getting further away from
the old vegetable drugs on which reliance
lias been placed for three or four hundred
years, and putting his faith more and more
in new preparations' administered by direct
injection. It is probable that in the‘next 50
years or so many of the old familiar com-
pounds will disappear entirely, leaving in their
places the hypodermic tablets which repre-
sent their active principles. Furthermore,
compounds p r e-
Par e d from the
animal body are
coming in t o in-
creasing use. There
are close on a
hundred of these
in the various
pharm a c o-
poeias, whereas it
is doubtful if there
was one 50 years
ago. In this con-
nection medical
science is getting
back rapidly to its
starting-point of a
couple of thousand
years ago, the first-
known therapeuti-
cal bodies being
prepared from dif-
ferent organs and
parts of animals,
the vegetable infu-
sions not coming
until much later
on. A noteworthy
thing about the
matter is that out
of the thousands
of new prepara-
tions of the
past ten years, not a solitary one has origin-
ated in the Commonwealth-—a feature to the
discredit of all of ns in any wav responsible
for the development of our chemistry.
Ida Dawson, the Monaro (N.S.W.) girl
whose Nature notes were often printed in the
“Abo.” columns, went off to Patagonia two
years ago, and now tells what life'is like in
that frozen land :
There are not many birds. Rhea (ostrich), con-
dor, wild geese, several duck, the all-pervading spar-
row, curlew and a bird like a kingfisher (with dull
plumage) are the only ones I have seen. The wild
geese are the most interesting; they are in flocks
of 300 or so, and feed together. At nesting-time they
keep house in pairs. The animals are guanacos, red
and grey foxes, chinchillas (a new species was found
here last year), skunks, various cats, one of them
with a beautiful spotted fur. The skunk is a prettv
little animal, and the lightest creature on its feet
I have ever seen. In the beginning of the winter
we had a plague of them—they even came into the
house o’ nights; one had a favorite corner in my
bedroom, and I used to sit up with lighted candle to
watch him, not daring to pelt him, for when
attacked they reply with an odor that clings for
days to everything within reach.
So far the winter has been mild, and we get out in
most weathers—of course in leather coats and caps
and high boots. The lowest reading of the glass to
date was 18deg. below zero centigrade—the most
wonderful frost I have ever seen. On Sunday we
have riding parties, so I see a good deal of this
extraordinary country. It seems a series of ancient
river and lake beds and extinct volcanoes, with the
most weird outcrops rising for hundreds of feet all
round, except .on one side, where there is a
gradual slope to the lower level; caves, ravines-
lakes on top of rocks; all sorts of queer things!
Last week there was word of a puma, so a party
of us rode out. It was delightful galloping over the
crisp snow; and we kept on climbing hills till we
came to a ravine with towering cliffs, in one place
widening out to the usual semi-circle. (These semi-
circles are a feature: they are usually sandstone
with bands of gaily-colored rock running through
them jet black, red, yellow and opalescent.) We
rode up the narrow way, so steep that I held to the
pommel, and coming down the horses slid, all feet
together—they are like cats. At the top we left
our horses, and clambered through drifts of frozen
snow, and over frozen pools, till we reached a huge
cave. I lie puma was not at home, but the waterfall
near by was frozen solid and great icicles hung
over the mouth of the cave. Below, each blade of
grass was a spear of ice; the whole effect was per-
fectly beautiful,
Uloola ; Twice I've heard the same sort
of thing. First it was from a Digger just
returned. He had seen it all. from the Land-
ing to \ illers-Bret.. and been knocked more
than once, but got through without serious
damage. "Yes,”; he ,said, after a half-hour’s
renyniscing, -it was a great joke, take it all
through—-1 d be off again to-morrow if if was
wanted. And the other day my lad {he
joined up before he was 16 and saw three-
years of it), after regaling an old
schoolmate for an hour or so with tales of
the lights and shades of it, wound up with :

gers who hurled themselves at the enemy

“Percy Pawnticket”: Sydney police have
had another of their spasms of activity re-
garding those girls whose life some long-ago
satirist christened “gay”; and Flossie con-
sitters that the methods employed are un-
fair. The new-suited young man wlm looks
like a prosperous countryman on holiday
and who hands her into a car which ho hails’
is apt to turn out to be a plain-clothes police-
man, and the car a police conveyance whirl-
ing her to over-cold night-quarters—and this
comes as a shock to the lady who has learnt
to dodge the orthodox tactics of John Hop.
The method is also distressing to some emi-
nently respectable members of the commu-
nity. One stout lady panted into a citv
police station with the news that she had
seen a poor girl forcibly abducted in a motor-
car by men whom she suspected to be “white-
slavers.” The police do not always score,
however. A fashionable dame, driving by in
her car, was hailed bv an agitated young
woman, who pointed to two men converging
slowly towards her, and implored a lift to
escape their unpleasant attentions. Readily
believing the worst of brutish men, the lady
let the girl take a seat beside her, and the
car shot past one of the men, who tried to

interfere. It was only a couple of days
later, when the girl had gone front the home
m which she had been given sanctuary and
some valuables had gone also, that the car-
owner found she had aided the escape of
a woman whom the police had decided to
arrest,as a public danger.

Gone are the roses that but yesterday
Filing their sweet fragrance on my homeward way*
And restlessly sigh fields of ripened wheat,
For Summer’s love is passionate and fleet.
Moon shadows fall upon the pallid grass.
As though to hide it from the winds that pass,
And whisper as they loiter on the way
Of thirsting buds and stricken grasses grey.
The quail are calling, and their plaintive notes,
Like music from a hundred silver throats
That sing of pain exquisite and of tears,
Send my thoughts speeding through the backward
years A
To that December night of long ago
When first you came to me, with eyes aglow,
Kebellious tawny hair, a careless maid,
Laughing, perverse and free and unafraid
And should I meet you, little love, grown wise,
lau £hing star-gleams dimmed within your eyes,
Mould r pass by, forgetting it was you,
The blithesome maid whom long ago I knew?
My heart would know you though my eyes were blind
Mith sorrow for the years that lay behind
Jor love, enduring, has the years defied,
Oh, dear and gracious woman by my side!

“Ded ’ee keep feet nice and dry cornin’ ’long
wet level?”
"'C oorse I ded. I taaked off me boots and
stocks.”
“Myristic”: Tell “Jimsey” (B. 3/11/’2l)
to give his flea-worried nipper 10 grains of flowers
of sulphur every other night and morning. The odds
are fleas will not trouble him as long as he takes it;
even if they do, the after-effects will not be so
pronounced. As a powerful auxiliary, iodoform may
be employed as a dusting powder. It is sure. But
it may serve to keep more than the fleas away, so
here is an alternative. Fill a small muslin bag with
anise seed and get the youngster to wear it con-
tinually. If he can’t gain the upper hand with
these weapons, he ought to throw in the towel. Sul-
phur, by the way, is most conveniently administered
in milk.
“Mag Sulph”: “Jimsey” wants to know
how to save his kids from the attentions of fleas.
Here goes to qualify for the Royal Humane Society’s
medal. In Asia, where the insects (the fleas, I mean)
form the major portion of the floating population,
regular baths of Epsom salts are given. They say
that once a flea dips his beak into a mag.-sulphated
hide, his old game of “putting the nips in” ceases
to hold any satisfaction.
“Jimsey”: “D.F.” (B. 10/11/’2l) says
that red ink can be made from the Phytolacca
decandra. Certainly; but let “D.F.” write his next
“Abo.” par with it, and he will find the screed
illegible a few hours later.
* * * *
“Gecko”: I can confirm the statement of
“Itsa Fac” (B. 3/11/’2l) that the black snake is a
fish-eater. I shot three in the early spring of 1919
basking on the granite rocks-fringing the Macdonald
River, New England (N.S.W.). The stomachs of
two specimens examined were stuffed with the usual
frog and lizard diet, but that of the third was
queued with three fresh-water black fish (Oodopois
marmaratus). Incidentally, snakes are a menace to
our greatest asset (bush children), and any induce-
ment (per bonus) to exterminate them (snakes, not
kids) would be both money and venom well spent.
It may be argued that snakes are dispatched with-
out any consideration of regard. Quite so; but why
isn’t the same argument allowed to have weight in
connection with the slaughtering of cormorants '!
* * * *
* “Murranji”: I don’t know much about
black brother’s arithmetic, but his knowledge of
volume is very limited. In the Territory, if a boy
is sent to see how a waterhoie is standing, his report
is made in one of three expressions: “Little bit
water,” “Mob water,” “Big mob water.” The first
might be liquid mud or a well, the second anything
to last from a week to six months, the third from a
large shallow pool to the Pacific Ocean.
“A.E.8.”: On a farm on which I lived
for 17 years we had a tortoise measuring about nine
inches across. We also had a kitten. At pretty
well any hour of the day -yort might see the kitten
seated on the back of the tortoise, while that reptile,
seemingly ignorant of the kitten’s presence, strolled
about the garden eating grass. As soon as the tor-
toise stopped eating and withdrew its head and legs
into the shell the kitten would dismount, and wait
till its steed resumed its journey.
“Ando”: I saw “Ortimo Beale’s” alleged
remedy of antbed ointment for a sting (B. 27/10/’2l)
tried by a man at Thargomindah (Q.) a few
years back. The result was a bad fester and a
subsequent lancing. In the case of insect stings,
Binghi’s remedy in S.-W. Queensland is a poultice
of chcwed-up young eucalyptus leaves. This appa-
rently draws all the poison out.
* * * *
“Veronal”: Birds which nest fairly high
up in trees and yet bring their young to the ground
before they can fly—such as
the mountain duck (chestnut
breasted sheldrake) and the
wood duck (maned goose)
—carry them down on their
backs, I think. The hooded
robin also, unwisely, often
brings its two chicks to the
ground before they have
qualified for the flying corps,
probably in the same manner.
Hence they must often be-
come the prey of goannas
and foxes. Jhis habit may
account for the scarcity (com-
pared with scarlet and flame-
breasted robins) of the pie-
bald chap. As regards the
jungle fowl (Megapodius
tumulus), which builds an
enormous cone-shaped mound
Of earth, sand and small
pebbles, to serve as an incu-
bator, it is still more prob-
able, as the abos. allege, that
the parent-birds bring the
chicks out of the hole left in
the centre of the mound on
their backs. The mound may
be from 4ft. to sft. in
height and 10ft. across the
base. The central hole, there-
fore, which the female enters
when laying her numerous
eggs, would also have
a depth of from 4ft. to sft.,
and the young megapodes
could scarcely, unassisted, scramble up the steep
sides of this, smoothed by the constant passage
down and up of mother njegapode when engaged
in her egg-laying contract. Binghi is correct in his
woodcraft, as a rule.
“ » * *
“Lilly Pilly”: About this time last year I
saw a mysterious light floating about. A few nights
ago I saw the same thing skimming slowly over
the top of the fowl-house. I thought it must be
the shining eye of a cat till it drifted away into
the open. Calling all hands and the cook, a wild
rush was made for it. It was easily caught, and
proved to be a little dark-brown beetle, about .a
quarter of an inch long, and narrow. Underneath
was a phosphorescent spot which glowed and pul-
sated as the insect breathed. It wasn’t much when
the insect was captured, but showed up many times
larger when it was flying. Is it a Jack o’ Lantern
or a firefly or both?
H r.n f a , resourcefulness of

which he successfully negotiated. The oxen-conduc-
tor jumped on his horse and followed, but, unfor-
tunately, the nag made a bad jump at the fence, and
came down, breaking the rider’s leg. His mate, realis-
ing the necessity of first aid, procured a brace and bit
from the tool box, bored a hole right through the
leg, put a 4in. nail through the hole, and clenched
it on the axe; then with a length of wire he bound
up the leg, Switching it tight with the good old
Queensland twitch, and started him off again after
the erring brindle, whom he brought back, yoked
up with the rest of the 18, and drove in front of
a 10-ton load of wool into Euston, a distance of
80-odd miles, where he got the leg satisfactorily
fixed up. The man was as well known in Western
Riverina as Billy Hughes is in Bendigo, and died
some years after in the Swan Hill Hospital, with
the leg as sound as ever. P.S. —Will it spoil the
story to mention that the leg was a wooden one?
“Snell”: In Tasmania a mate of mine,
Withers, coming from his work one evening, saw a
tree struck by lightning. He described it as a blind-
ing flash in which every leaf of the tree stood forth
in silhouette, and for seven or eight days thereafter
he could see nothing but that black tree, each limb,
branch and leaf in perfect detail in a blaze of
golden light. Then gradually the picture faded, but
it was many months before normal sight was restored.
* * * *
“Tringle” : Re “Jim Carew’s” par. about the
fights that started on the diggings when a man was
called “Joe” (B. 17/11/’2l). On some 2J.S.W.
diggings “Joe” shouted from claim to claim was a
substitute for our present 12 o’clock whistle, and
was a call to tucker, not to war. It may have been
a slang expression for cook or slushy. Incidentally,
it doesn’t pay to use slang in a strange land. I
nearly got shot at dawn for telling a Yankee nurse
in Rouen hospital that she looked “knocked up.”
This is plain Aussie for tired, but Yankee for quite
another condition. I’m still shell-shocked from the
row I landed into.
* * * •
“Ishmael”: “McNorth’s” hatter (B.
3/11/’2l) wasn’t the only one of his tribe in the
Territory. There used to be another on the Daly
River, and his humpy was the only building in that
district with glass windows. On inquiring one day
why he never cleaned them I was told indignantly
that he did. He cleaned them on the inside so
that he could see out, but left them dirty oh the
outside so that the flamin’ niggers couldn’t see in.
“Te Whare”: Those who have tried roast
black snake say it is as tender as chicken, and the
flesh white, like that of an eel. Brother Binghi doted
on roast snake, but where the reptile was venomous
he wouldn’t eat it unless he was quite sure that the
squirmer had not bitten itself while being killed,
as it sometimes does. Considered as food, venomous
snakes are no more repulsive than green eels, also
considered venomous, but in fact rot so, and whole-
some as to flesh. The abos. of Northern Territory
are said to wax fat on water snakes, of which there
are at least three northern species, including the
Australian bockadam, Richardson’s water-snake and
the white-bellied water-snake—all venomous.
* * * *
“Mack”: The Torres Strait or nutmeg
pigeon comes south from New Guinea in the early
spring to breed on the islands along the North
Queensland coast. The nest is roughly built of
small twigs and grass in the low trees. The hen
lays one egg, which she hatches out. As soon as
the chicken arrives, ma lays another egg, and leaves
HIS LITTLE BREACH OF ETIQUETTE.
“ Madam, your little boy called me ‘old
Monkey face!”
“’Orace, where’s your manners? Call the
gentleman Mister Monkeyface at once!”
baby to hatch it while she attends to the larder. As
soon as No. 2 is hatched ma lays another egg, and
the performance goes on for as many as five times in
one season.

PLYING KATE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It makes us old hands sick and tired to hear
Them talk of their champions to-day;
Eurythmics and Davids —yes, I’ll have a beer —
Are only fair hacks in their way.
“Now this happened out west before records were
took,
And it’s not to be found in the Guide,
But it’s honest Gorstruth, and I can’t be mistook,
For it happens that I had the ride.
’Twas the Hummers’ Creek Cup, and our mare Flying
Kate
Was allotted eleven stun two;
The race was two miles; you’ll agree with me, mate,
It was asking her something to do.
“She was heavy in foal, but the owner and me
Decided to give her a spin—■
We were right on the rocks; ’twas the end of a spreej
So we needed a bit of a win.
“I saddled her up and went down with the rest.
Her movements were bulgy and slow;
The starter to get us in line did his best,
Then swishing his flag he said ‘Go!’
“The field jumped away, but the mare seemed asleep,
And I thought to myself, ‘We’ve been sold’;
Then I heard something queer, and I felt I could
weep,
For strike me if Kate hadn’t foaled!
“The field by this time had gone half a mile,
But I knew what the old mare could do,
So I gave her a cut with the whip—you can smile,
But the game little beast simply flew.
Twas then that she showed ’em her wonderful
speed,
For we mowed down the field one by one;
With a furlong to go we were out in the lead,
And prepared for a last final run.
“Then something came at us, right on the outside,
And we only just scratched past the pole;
When I had a good look I thought I’d have died,
For I’m blowed if it wasn’t the foal!”

‘‘H.V.E.”: At what time after their
chicken-hood, do black shags (Phalacrocorax cor bo )
put on their clerical raiment? I saw one the other
day dressed in dark
greyish-brown, with a
reddish tinge on the
breast, which was
much paler in color
than the back and
wing plumage. For a
(usually) most alert
shag he was very
tame and easy -of ap-
proach and evidently
a this season’s bird.
Shags are early
breeders. They usually
arrive at the lagoons

tortoises come out of
the mud, frogs are

young mullet are
beginning to sparkle
on the surface. The
satin bower-bird is
said not to assume his
glossy violet - black
raimept until about
the seventh moult.
Previously he wears a
yellowish-green coat,
like the ladies of his
harem. The male blue
wren (superb warb-
ler), too, is at first
only distinguishable
from the pale brown
females by some dark-
blue tail-feathers. His gorgeous liven- comes after
several moults.
* * * *
“Bung”: “Med’s” history (B. 10/11/’2l)
of the Georgian negress who gave birth to a black
and a brindle four months apart emboldens me to
mention it. In Westralia in 1912 a brood mare
suspected of being unproductive to a blood horse
was, for experiment, placed with a donkey. In due
time she dropped a foal to the horse, and some
months later brought along the mule also. She was
not permitted to rear the second offspring; but dur-
ing the time she had it with her she showed no
favoritism.
“McNorth” : Aeonitin, the active principle
of aconite, recently mentioned as- having been used
on the spurs 0 f fluting cocks, may be a rapid

removed and the points dried over a slow and smokv

weapons will set up a most malignant form of blood-
poisoning attended with fatal results in an hour or
so. The best remedy is to keep the patient walking
so as to’ induce free circulation and prevent coagula-
.lon. If is said that in the region of the Fly and
Strickland rivers (Papua) arrows are similarly
treated, but this is very doubtful, as no positive
case of the use of envenomed weapons has ever been
recorded in Papua.

“Echap”: “Delhi’s” largest ’roo (B.

Trekelano (Q.) in 1918 that, evoked grunts from
three of us' when we hove him aboard the buggy to
take him home for dogs’ meat. All hands at the
camp pronounced him the King Gee and assessed
his weight at well over 12st. Curiously enough no

J.H.L. : The early explorers and navi-
gators couldn’t be fussy about their food. Dampier
fed on sharks and kangaroos when he sailed about
the westralian coast, and Cook mentions that kan-
garoo flesh was fine eating. Stewed greenhide satis-
fied Leichhardt on one part of his journey, while
at another place his party found flying-foxes sn
palatable that they ate them for breakfast, dinner
and supper, Kennedy and his faithful Jacky de
voured their dogs. A meal of yarns and roasted
snake made Burke very ill, though after this, alono-
with Wills and King, he relished roasted rat and
cakes made from nardoo. When the Forrest
brothers were exploring- in Wgstralia, they used to
have such delicacies as emu eggs, kangaroo-tail
soup and roast haunch of kangaroo, with cockatoo
stew for Sunday’s dinner. Eyre and Wylie killed
their horse that was knocked up and feasted and
what was left was cut into strips, dried in the
sun and taken on the track with them. And we

THE LITTLE TRACKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The straight road, the high road,
Betwixt its scanty flowers,
Is your road and my road
If we but make it ours ;
But the wild, sweet flowers delight us,
And the wild, sweet flowers it lacks,'
And the little tracks invite us,
And we take the little tracks.
The free track, the long track,
It has a magic spell—
The love track, the long track,
The track of ne’er-do-well;
And we tread them little caring
In the noontide’s golden glow*
For the grave folk, grimly faring
On the road they’d have us go.
The high road's a sore road
Uncarpeted by ease,
’Tis my road and your road
To follow if we please ;
But the tracks are fair to travel
W ith their lights and shadows sweet,
And their lack of dust and gravel,
And their grasses for the feet
The free track, the long track,
It has a magic spell;
The love-track, the song-track,
The track of ne’er-do-well;
For a man may quit them, ’longing
For the high road, grim and grave,
But when heavy hours eorne thronging
Tis the little tracks he’ll eraVe.
The straight road, the high road
Where feet go firm and fast,
Though your road or my road,
It has an end at last;
And it happens oft and often,
When the world fades like a ghost
At ]d the shades of twilight soften,
That the little tracks count most.
The free track, the long track,
The tracks that climb and wend,
The love-track, the song-track,
They too must have an end ;
For the ways that we may follow,
Though they endless seem at whiles—
Winding on through hill and hollow—
Are but certain numbered miles.

gives 75 per cent, better service, a closer sbave and more shaves from every
blade. Think what it means to have a razor 75 per cent, better than the world’s
best —to use the same fine Gillette Blades as you have known for years,
but now to experience the maximum benefit of their perfect edge.
You can identify the new Improved Gillette by its Fulcrum Shoulder,
Automatic Adjustment, Overhanging Cap, Channelled Guard, Diamond
Knurled Handle, Diamond on Guard.
The function of the Fulcrum Shoulder and the Overhanging Cap is to hold
the blade more rigidly throughout its entire length of shaving edge than
was ever possible with the original Gillette. Their combined ad on on
the blade permits of an extremely close and comfortable shave.
The Channelled Guard, located under the cutting edge, prevents any clogging
or jamming with hair or lather, and permits the Blade to operate along its
entire length without in any way impairing the fador of safty. The teeth
of the New Guard hold the skin more smoothly in front of the cutting edge.
You’ll appreciate the merits of the New Improved Gillette as soon as you
see it. It is available to-day, in various styles, throughout Australia.
The increased life of the
Gillette Blades greatly
compensates you for
your purchase of the
New Improved Gillette.

passing through the movable-type stage, lhe
taxicab was iu use at a very early date; but
even the general work of the horse is to-day
performed by coolies. Among the earliest
remaining examples of Chinese literature are
topical verses opposing military conscription.
Women legislators and administrators have
been tried at various times —once consider-
ably b.c. —but men are still mishandling the
old political job. Out of all the ages of ex-
periment it may be argued from a European
point of view that Cliina has not made a
success of her selection of ways; but
cannot apply to literature and art. Even
in translation the writings of Chinese philoso-
phers and poets have a quality winch no
racial misunderstanding can disguise; and
the art of China challenges the best that
ever came from the Creek mind. When,
therefore, we find that China relegates fic-
tion to a field outside literature and art, her
judgment on the matter must have a lot of
weight. This is the more notable because
during the time of her conquest by those glit-
tering Mogul emperors among whom Ivubla
stands out as a person of immense artistic
desires, the long novel was the popular form
of reading with the conquerors. If the novel
had possessed real literary value it would
have made good under such lofty patronage ;
but it remained in the Chinese mind a thing
of no more permanent importance than a
trade deal or a political harangue.
Is there not some ground for believing that
our own novel is going the same way? A
few writers of fiction who lived between the
middle of the eighteenth century and the
middle of the nineteenth are allowed a certain
sort of immortality; but the serious literary
critic would probably hesitate before giving
even to Fielding and Thackeray a place on
the roll of fame beside such modern poets
as Swinburne and Francis Thompson. Of
the great mass of novelists who enjoyed large
sales during their writing years hardly even
a memory remains when the dust of half a
century is upon their works The good
storytellers of to-day are to be counted m
thousands. Their works are devoured by a
large public which is willing often to pay
for two days’ absorption in the details of a
well-constructed plot a price that very few of
its members offer more than three or four
times in a lifetime for any other kind of
book. It is surely plain enough that the
general interest in fiction has no connection
whatever with literature. Characterisation,
word pictures, the grace of easy and lucid
writing, the creation of atmosphere and some-
thing of life philosophy are supposed to be
the things that make novels worth while. The
critic may appear to demand all these; but
the readers and buyers care nothing about
them. It is not even true that modern
fiction is an easy introduction to literature;
for with its steady increase there has been
an equally steady decline in the demand for
new books of more permanent value. Poetry,
for instance, had once a real buying public
people paid a good round sum for each im-
portant volume as it appeared, and discussed
it in clubs and drawing-rooms. Now there
is hardly a publisher in the world who would
take a new volume of poems unless he thought
it had some appeal beyond its purely poetic
' a The fact is that the pseudo-literature of
the modern novel is exalted to a place it
does not deserve. Books of fiction of an
almost illiterate kind and dealing with
phases of life that are of no interest beyond
their utility for the author’s plot hre re-
viewed at great length and purchased by
libraries which are intended to have an
educational purpose. The Chinese are
honest about all this; we are not. Through
cheaper and cheaper fiction and the praises
bestowed upon it, we are continually lower-
ing the standard of national expression. In-
stead * seeking to find our true voice, and
calling all the people who read to listen for
its tones, we are bein'g drowned in mere
babble. ,
A moral revolution in letters is the thing
needed. Let it be fairly recognised that
fiction-writing is a branch of commerce
rather than a branch of art, and all will be
well. Fiction is good in its place; it relieves
the tedium of days for those whose imagina-
tion is so weak that it requires a cheap
stimulant. Many good modern novels rise
to heights of entertainment quite equal to
musical comedy or melodrama. Our sin
lies in claiming more than this for them,
making a pretence that the novelist is or
the same class and kind as the poet, the
philosopher or the imaginative historian.
Much that passes for philosophy and history
is not literature ; much that passes for poetry
is merely prose-thought in verse; but even
at their worst writings of this kind are
aiming higher than fiction. If we were_ per-
fectly honest about the regard in which we
hold the novel, we should admit that we
like to be amused without being compelled
to feel or think deeply; and that, as the
novel supplies what we want, it is nice to
pretend that it has become the first mode ot
human expression.
P.O.M.
Joe Gordon His Book
Twenty-one years ago Colonel J- M.
Gordon, a special-service officer from South
Australia, met a verminous and starving
corporal of a N.S.W. unit, with whom he
had had some previous acquaintance, in the
Market Square of Bloemfontein and
promptly invited him to lunch. lo the
great embarrassment of the unshaven and
ragged n.c.0., the Colonel took him into the
Bloemfontein Hotel, which, in March, 1.100,
was sacred to generals and staff-officers, and
almost out of bounds to anyone below held
rank. There were no subalterns, at any rate.
And here, by some strange miracle of the
Colonel’s personality, the disreputable cor
poral was made, against his convictions as to
the fitness of things, to feel perfectly at
home. All these years afterwards this little
inciaent seems to account to some extent tor
the sort oi charm of manner there is aoout
Brigadier-General J. M. Gordon’s personal
reminiscences, The Chronicles of a. Gay Gor-
don (Cassell).
General Gordon writes so well and has so
much to write about that his life story fills a
thick volume, and if it were thicker still it
would be even more welcome. It is full of
good things, and, apart from its charm on
that account, it has a value in its historical
aspects. The years between the withdrawal
from Australia of the Imperial troops that
had sparsely garrisoned the continent for 80
years—from Aithur Phillip’s landing until
1870 —and the foundation of the army of the
Commonwealth had much to do with the ulti-
mate shaping of the latter. It was not
until long after the six colonies had assumed
their present geographical bounds that the
English regiments went home, and the land
defences of Australia were left in the hands
of the Australians. In his story of the de-
velopment of the defences of South Australia,
with which he had much to do, Gordon draws
a vivid picture of the pioneering work that
made it possible for the Commonwealth to
equip an army of over 400,000 men for ser-
vice in the Big War. It is a story of many
difficulties, mistakes, and hardly-won achieve-
ments in the task —not yet comnleted —of
teaching this young nation the noble art of
self-defence. The little army that went to
South Africa was the outcome of this
pioneering—and it is perhaps not too much
to say that it also had its influence in the
organisation of the A.I.F. To Richardson,
Downes, Ricardo, Hutton, Price, George
French, J. M. Gordon and other commandants
and staff-officers of pre-Federation days,
Australia owes much for teaching her sons
the elements of soldiering, and this book is
a useful reminder of the fact.
And it is also the very interesting story of
a very likeable and humorous chap, readable
and clever, and with very much less of the
“I” about it than might have been inferred
from some recently cabled remarks of Sir
Edward Ilutton. Throughout Australian
military circles it has been customary to
refer to General Gordon, flippantly and
affectionately, as “Joe.” But that is not
his proper name. It is nothing less
than Jos£ Maria .Tacobo Rafael Francisco
Gabriel Del Corazon De Jesus Gordon y
Prendergast—but it is easier to say here
that Joe Gordon’s book is well worth read-
ing than to refer to him under all his exten-
sive nomenclature.

Child Literature
“Country Fed.” (R.P. 3/11/’2l) is pretty
right when he' suggests that the child-lust
for tragedy is the female’s fault and goes
back to our savage, ancestors. The mother
of to-day, endeavoring to inspire her children
with a love for beauty and truth, is all the
time up against the mothers and fathers and
children of the savage ages—and especially
the mothers who did not even have a news-
paper in which to read casualties, so in-
vented horrors for themselves. Almost all
our nursery rhymes and fairy tales are the
original products of the female mind, and
they have been handed down to us red with
the gore of centuries, unmolested and very
little altered. “The Forty Thieves,” one
of the oldest of fairy tales, the best tale of
its sort that Asia has given us, hangs to-
gether by a series of indescribable crimes.
Coming nearer home what shall be said of
the ghastly giant in “Jack and the Bean-
stalk,” whose cry is known by children all
over the world?—
Fee, fi, to, fum,
I smell the blood of an Englishman.
Be he alive or be he dead
I'll grind his bones to make my bread.
No atrocity dreamed could equal that of the
giant grinding up a corpse to make bread.
But, somewhere, long, long ago, there lived
a woman who told a child that, and the child
passed it on. The fact that Jack was a dis-
obedient boy is forgotten in the magic of the
bean-stalk and the bad boy’s success. How
many mothers of to-day would have Jack’s
mother or the mother of the fairy-tale to
tea, anyway? Very few. Yet the sensitive,
impressional, imaginative child makes their
acquaintance and begins to know them as
well as his own mother long before he is five.
A better example of the mother who
needed a little erfeche and kindergarten train-
ing is to be found in the favorite nursery-
tale, “Little Red Riding Hood.” That tale
has long been the picked one in the majority
of schools and homes. Books have been
written on the reason for this. The story
has been known for centuries and its kin is
to be found in the tales of many lands. But,
as far as I know, no one has ever pointed
out the very evident fact that a little girl
in a city school once pointed out to me. I
said to her, “Mary, what would you do if
your mother sent you out into the wood
alone and told you to go straight to
Granny’s?” The answer came as promptly
as commonsense: “I don’t think my mother
would send me out into the bush alone.”
Quite obvious. Little Red Riding Hood’s
mother has for generations been sending her
out into a wood in which wolves wander, and
no one has called at the mother’s hut to tell
her she should be ashamed of herself. The
perfectly gruesome finish of the story has
never been surpassed anywhere. Yet if you
were to hold a competition to discover the
six most popular mothers of the world Red
Riding Hood’s would have to go on the
list. That she does more yearly damage
to the child-mind than all the “pictures”
goes for nothing. She gets in her work early
—when the child is about three —and there
she remains.
The child’s helplessness is agonising in
these matters. His first song is nearly
always:—
Rockabve, baby, on the tree-top,
When the wind blows the cradle,will rock;
When the bough bends the cradle will fall,
Down will come baby, cradle and all.
A smashing lyric that! Calculated to calm
the noisiest -savage!
All these things seem to point to the fact
that the female mind does not thmk —or did
not in the nursery-rhyme and fairy-tale age.
The male mind has not done much better
for the child. Peter Pan is a delightful
enough being to the adult, but let him loose
in an imaginative boy’s brain, and the next
thing that boy is doing is helping his baby
sister or brother to fly out of a high window.
You cannot play pretence with the child-
mind. There is a time, taken before the
flood of life spoils him, when the child
believes that every story he hears is a
true story. That is where the deadly work
begins; for the young child is the true
believer into whose receptive brain the old
tales wash with all their blood and terror
perpetually. The child takes you at your
word, so that “The Water Babies” is about
the worst example in the world to set land
babies, and Kipling’s young Mowgli, skin-
ning a tiger in the jungle, is not for the child-
mind at all. All these tales, ancient as well
as modern, seem to have been written to
stimulate the imagination of the child with-
out regard for the very apparent fact that a
child is born with a perfectly balanced
brain, and has, as a rule, more imagination
than the adult.
How can we wonder at tlie barbarity or
the child when for generations he has been
taught that Little Jack Horner was a good
boy for eating with his fingers? And what shall
be said of the mother-influence of “Rock-a-
bve, Baby”? It may go back to a time when
we lived in trees and the original Jack Hor-
ner may have said he was a bad boy when he
put his horrid little thumb into his pie in-
stead of a spoon. But it excuses nothing.
The immoral influence of such things is there
all the time.

Gentle Annie Makes Good, by Caroline Loekhait
(Fisher Unwin). Stung by the scorn of the only
girl in the world a U.S. johnnie takes up a
selection in Wyoming and proves himself a man.
A well-worn theme, but Caroline Lockhart handles
it brilliantly. Her book is full of healthy tun
and vigorous pen-portraiture. Ajid with a little
allowance for differences of geography and custom,
the life and people she describes so vividly would
pass for Australian; again and again one is re-
minded of the Bush. A .rattling good novel that
every Australian reader will relish.
Record of a Journey Round the World in 1920,
by Becheley Crundall This Englishman’s facts
are often wrong; his conclusions, come to on insuffi-
cient evidence/are as often faulty; and he has no
graces to atone for his infirmities. Even if he is
right in saying that Australia is a great country
to emigrate to it isn’t because he knows Australia,
It phi ns this page to think it can offer no better
verdict upon the literary effort of a man who was
so impressed by Australian newspapers that when
he get back home those of London sickened him.
Barbara Justice, by Diana Patrick (Hutchinson).
Barbara is a beautiful nymph, who joins a troupe
of vaudeville mermaids and discovers a noble-hearted
invalid who marries her for the pleasure of leaving
her all his money wherewith to restore the fortunes
of the lad who captured her heart in the second
chapter. Not a bad effort at popular fiction, but
the authoress is too considerate in killing off only
four of lier numerous characters.
Maki, by R. J. Minney (.John Lane). A high-caste
Hindoo girl, whose mother is dead, is brought up
to know nothing at all of the world outside her
part of the home. Left unmarried until rather late
in the day—about 17-—she doesn’t settle down
with her deformed husband as she might have
done had she been transplanted earlier. She runs
away, and, fearing to return home, sees nothing
wrong in surrendering herself to one temporary
husband after another. This is Maki. Is it true to
nature? Would a girl do it? Later, having learned
more, she, in order to preserve herself from the
attentions of men, disfigures herself ; and that seems
hardly less true. But there is fine color in this
story of Calcutta.
The Escaping Club, by A. J. Evans (John Lane).
There are no pretensions to fine writing about this
book by one who is better known to most Australians
as a Test cricketer than as an ex-Major in the
R.A.P. If anything he overdoes the terse, soldierly
style. But nothing could make the story tedious.
In fact, his escape from' the German Strafe Camp
into Switzerland has something of the breathless
quality of Casanova’s immortal clamber over the
Venetian roofs, though Evans had a brave and
resourceful soldier for a'companion instead of a
coward. But more amazing than any of his escapes
or attempted escapes is the series of pictures he pre-
sents of German forbearance, German chivalry, and,
above all, German incapacity to impose discipline.;
The Mirrors of Washington (Putnam’s). Some-
body having written “The Mirrors of Downing
Street,” somebody else, who remains anonymous, .does
the same service for Uncle Sam’s political G.H.D.
Fourteen heads are put on the table and
dissected; and the work is done unsparingly. The
result is absorbingly interesting. Warren Gamaliel
Harding is handled first —with more toleration than
some of the others. A small-town man, the outsider
wonders how ever he came to be President of a great
Republic. But “an American President is selected
by the newspapers, which know little about him; by
the politicians, who do not want a master but a
slave; by the delegates to a Convention, tired, with
hotel bills mounting, ready to name anybody in
order to go home.” But Harding knows his limita-
tions, and “out of his modesty, his desire to rein-
force himself, has proceeded the strongest _ Cabinet
that Washington has seen for a generation.” The
analysis of Woodrow Wilson is less sparing. “It
was my fortune,” this anonymous writer says, “to
see him at the apex of his career.... His League
Covenant had just been agreed to He told
stories of his at the Peace table, especially
of one who never read the memoranda his secre-
taries prepared, who was so deaf that he could not
hear a word spoken in conference, and who spoke so
loudlv that no one could interrupt him. ‘What could
one do,’ Mr. Wilson asked, ‘to penetrate a mind like
that ?’ ” The reader who has the good fortune to
meet these studies of Harding and Wilson will not put
down the book till he has gone through the whole
list—Root, probably the ablest man in the public
life of the U.S.A., who “would make a splendid
President but would be a hopeless candidate ,
Hoover (“had he a personality with his instinct,for
publicity he would be another Roosevelt ) ; House,
Wilson’s greatest friend; .liidge Hughes, kojlge,
Knox, Hiram .Johnson, Lansing, Borah (who says
franklv “I dislike the British and despisc the hi -
erite Balfour”)—-this is a g.allerv which, bes des
being fujl of interest, is of solid value to the student
not onlv' of U.P’.A. politics, but of the Disarmament
Conference’s proceedings as well.

“Mr. Oeky”: It shouldn’t take the War

accumulated stocks of material. I know a
place in Vic. where the timber was lying
out for weeks. It was for only a small
house, but you could have , built a stadium
and still have had enough wood over for a
.'.stable or two. After a while some workmen
feverishly dug portion of the heaps out of the
■ mud and ■ built the house—without any
spoutsi No amount of coaxing or swearing
cou{d induce the Department to provide
spouts. It seems to be up against the diffi-
culty of having a surfeit of boards and a
shortage of . spouts. As one noted for busi-

its timber-mills for a spout factory.

“Ewa”: There is a man in Sydney Who
studies the bereavement notices and jots
. down the Christian and surname of some
male deceased, together with data as to his
lodge, age, etc. Then after waiting, for a
week or so he knocks at the door where the
deceased lived,: and asks for Tom. Dick or
Harry, as the name might be. When the
widow tells him that li6r husband is dead
his grief (from long practice) would melt
the heart of a pawnbroker. He relates
brokenly how much he liked Tom, and later
casually mentions that Tom had asked him
to come out some day to get gn old suit
that he could make use of. It usually comes
off, as the widow has no immediate use for
men’s clothing, and she parts with a suit—
and, incidentally, helps to build up a second-

“Crabtree” : Wagga (N.S.W.) now has a
tent-town, with a population of 38 adults and
37 children. Shortage of houses gave birth
to the ; but a lot of the inhabi-
tants, having experienced the careless, rent-
free life, are not inclined to return to ordi-
nary dwellings if they are provided. In the
hard times after the bank smashes of the
’nineties Sydney itself had its camp com-
munities, the biggest of them on Red Hill.
Paddington, oyerlooking the Agricultural
Ground. The places were built of ’odds and
ends; and some of them had flower-gardens.
When Authority decided that the excuse of
hard times had disappeared, they found it a
tough job to get the campers to revert to
ordinary rent-paying citizenship, although
there were hundreds of cheap houses howling
for tenants.
* ■» * *
“A.A.E.”: That the conscience of the
apparently respectable citizen can be a gilt-
edged asset to the plausible swindler was
proved by two cases in Melbourne recently.
In the first, a city business man was
approached by a stranger -’•ho produced a
red leather tablet on which was stamped
“A. McSanders, Detective.” After a few
preliminaries he suggested that £SO would
about compensate him for a sudden loss of
memory regarding certain matters which had
come under his notice. The £SO was handed
over, and the amateur detective vanished.
In case No. 2 the plausible gent introduced
himself as an official of the Taxation De-
partment ; but he allowed himself to be
beaten down to a mere £2 for a similar
lapse of memory. These two instances were
brought under the notice of the police. How
many others are there in which the swindled
parties keep a discreet silence?
* * * *
“Silas”: The other evening a Melbourne ■
town traveller, drifting along St. Ivilda-road
in his tin Lizzie, ran into a casual man at
the intersection with Dandenong-road, and
walked over him with two wheels. When
approached the victim was found to have no
more wind in him that a burst balloon. Mea-
sures were taken to restore ; the apparently
breathless ; but as he was still incapable of
action he was loaded into the car and driven
to hospital. By the way he developed a
turn for business and started negotiations.
The motorist was entirely to blame, he de-
clared. and as he was bread-winner for a
large family restitution would have to be on
the grand scale. Recognising his culpabibty.
the motorist suggested a lump sum. The
other shook his head. “No,” he said, “I
won’t do that. What I’ve got before was
50 sbillin’s a rib, and I won’t take a penny
less.” He received 50 shillings ner rib for
three broken ribs, and seemed to think he’d
done a good day’s work.
THE LIGHTS OF PROGRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The yellow lights of George-street
Are shining through the mist—
Gold beneath the horses’ feet
In lanes of amethyst.
Tlie shadows come, the shadows go,
The high-stooped buii&pgs shine;
Behind the car there seems to flow
A thin red streak of wine.
They had such lights in Babylon,
Such shadows moved in Rome;
When all the clamorous day had gone
Back to its suburb home,
This same old hooded mystery
Between the glare and glow
Played hide-and-seek in Nineveh
And Tyre an age ago.
It was the same—yet not the same
(Here let the flutes blow shrill).
For all the lights of ancient fame,
Our way is forward still.
Out leaps the large and flaming word
That moves and stirs and thrills;
Upsoaring like a happy bird
Our thought ascends to —pills I

DO you want your friends to avoid you? They
certainly will if your breath is bad. There is
no excuse for anyone having a bad breath. It is
caused by disorders of the stomach, and any stomach
trouble can be corrected by taking Chamberlain’s
Tablets. Many, after years of suffering, have been
permanently relieved of stomach trouble and its result-
ant bad breath by the use of Chamberlain’s Tablets.

A Fair Principle And A Fair Price
Dodge Brothers have never failed to im-
prove their car continually.
Yet the price of this car today compared
with its cost is lower in proportion than it
was at the very beginning.
As production increased, the saving has
been faithfully invested and reinvested in
the betterment of the car.
But the margin of profit has never been
permitted to exceed a fixed and definite
figure.
The price has always been kept closely
within the bounds of fairness.
Dodge Brothers will continue to build their
car so well that the purchase price will be
as nearly as possible the last expenditure.

“Neen”: A touching epitaph in Waaia
cemetery (Vic.), concerning a man who seems
to have overdone it
Here Willie our dearly loved one lies,
The Lord has called him to the skies;
He filled his belly till he bust,
And now we’ve laid him in the dust.
The year-end brings the usual batch of
Collins’s Australasian diaries, ranging from
a fine, fat desk volume to the nattiest of vest-
pocket affairs —an ingenious collection calcu-
lated to drive a livery business man mad,
because he can’t say there’s not one to suit
him.
J. B. Patterson, who was knighted when
he w r as Vic. Premier and member for Castle-
maine, is being remembered in his native vil-
lage 26 years after his death.. The other
day Walter Buneiman, ex-Cabinet Minister,
unveiled a tablet in Link Hall Cottage on
his estate in Northumberland as a memento
to the Radical-Coalitionist-Conservative poli-
tician who, with all his faults, was a big
man in many ways.
The new suite of rooms on the north side
of Federal Parliament House has already
justified the prophecies of officials by de-
veloping a temperature in the warm weather.
A patent boiler to provide the elect with
warm water for afternoon tea and minor
ablutions has helped the sun to grill the
occupants, so now the order has gone forth
for a drove of electric fans to be erected in
the apartments. Money doesn’t matter to
W. M. Hughes, whose freakish plan to
obtain privacy for his colleagues outside the
main building, which is kept cool by its
thick stone walls, will command their regrets
as the summer warms up.
“Tauwarra”: The civilised nigs, about
Moresby (Papua) are keen movie enthusi-
asts. “Sali Saplin” and “Pati Bogabada”
(Fatty Arbuckle) are first in popular
esteem, but Brown Brother, like his white
boss, gets very restive when treated to an
overdose of Yankee “sob stuff.” We were
yawning through the usual pictured mush
about the drunken husband, the crippled
cheeild and the virtuous wife. During one
of the scenes, the lady dropped to her knees,
folded her hands and exposed the whites of
her eyes. As the tears coursed down her
cheeks, a big Kiwai buck sitting at the
back grunted his approval. “Tha’s right,
Sinabada,” he said —“you talk ’longa Jesus.”
“Capitaine” : This is not a Dickens satire
on circumlocution, but the London agents’
sober report to their Australian principals
re negotiations for the purchase of an ex-
requisitioned steam vessel from the British
Government: —
We were too optimistic in writing you a fortnight
ago. Our application was made to the Secretary of
the Admiralty, who referred it to the Director of
Dockyards, who approved and sent it back to the
Secretary of the Admiralty, who passed it on to the
Director of Contracts, who recommended it for ap-
proval to the Board of Admiralty, who gave their
approval and returned it to the Director of Contracts,
who a week ago told us that it had been sent on to
the Disposals Board. The Disposals Board have not
yet received it, and it may be that we shall eventu-
ally negotiate with a private firm.
It’s simply another instance, of course, of
the sort of thing, that has ruled out State
socialism as a' practical working system.
Irma Caron, who went to London some
months ago, has her photo and an interview
in the Stab. Only a passing reference is
made to her as “a famous Australian singer,”
but her ideas about domestic arrangements
in English towns are reported at length.
She was amazed to see her landlady go
down on hands and knees to nolish floor-
cloths which could have been as adequately
brightened with a polishing mop. The
matutinal whitening of front-door steps
offended her aesthetic sense, whilst exciting
her sympathy for the girl who was acquir-
ing “housemaid’s knee” in doing it. A con-
servative British housewife told her that
whitening doorsteps was a religious rite
which would endure until Judgment Day,
please God ! As fm* the Cockney bathroom,
with its 'ancient bath-heater and lack of
shower spray. Irma could only apologise for
her criticism by promising that some other
time she would speak of “things I find quite
perfect in England.”
Ever since the Northern Rivers district of
N. S. Wales began to ask for decentralisa-
tion, relations between it and the “decen-
tralising” Government at Sydney have
shown signs of strain. In fact, the decen-
tralising Government at Sydney has got into
the habit of telling the North that unless it
bends its neck to the yoke it may expect
two things—beans and Sheol. Apropos of
which this news item: —
In reply to Mr. R. S. Perdriau, M.L.A., the Rail-
way Commissioners state that the increase of 10 per
cent, in rates and fares on certain sections of the
North Coast Railway compared with other lines in
the State is due to'the working expenses exceeding
the revenue.
Other lines that don’t even pay working ex-
penses include those from Clyde to Carli'ng-
ford, Lidcombe to Regent’s Park, Iviama to
Nowra (born 1893), Galong to Boorowa,
Demondrille to Blayney, Koorawatha to
Grenfell, Blacktown to Richmond (just out-
side Sydney and dating from 1864), Tulla-
more to Tottenham, and a dozen others.
But there is no talk of increasing charges
on those lines. They are in non-criminal
districts that don’t talk about separation.
“Fax”: Somebody protests against stage
aspersions on the morals of artists, such as
are cast in “Scandal.” Artists in melo-
drama, it seems, are rarely married and
never respectable, one exception which
proves the rule being the three gallant com-
rades in “Trilby,” whose bohemian life in
Paris would hardly have brought a blush
to the petals of a rose. A studio m
the general way is a spider’s web, or a
rendezvous for flagrant indiscretions. It
holds no guilty secrets, because the audi-
ence is always led to know the worst of it,
and the ordinary velvet jacket of a painter
is regarded by all good theatre-goers as the
livery of sin. Somebody who has Art m
the family complains of what she calls a
“Jib'd on the profession.” Painters are not
all like that. The ones she knows are shin-
ing examples to butchers and bakers, especi-
ally butchers, judging from what you read
in the divorce reports. What makes _ hex
so emphatic on the subject was the giddj
remark of a silly girl whom she proposer
to take with her to afternoon tea at tht
studio of cousin Jack. “Oh, lead me not
into temptation, my dear,” said the flippant
one. Since when they hoye not been wear
ing one another’s hats. J

“Tas.”: Hobart Mercury- (19/11/’21)
announced that the Marquis of- Townshend
had died from ‘-angora pectoris,” and in a
personal note remarked that once "the men-
tal capacity of the Marquis was called in
question.” The thing that finished him cer-
tainly does sound like a goat disease.
I a.al P.”: Kingsley Fairbridge. who
runs the Farm School of that name in
Westralia (B. 10/11/121), was the first
white child born in Rhodesia after it was
taken over by the Chartered Co. Unless mv
memofy deceives me Rhodes was his god-
father. He comes from Umtali. - '
Motoi luggage-trucks, iTsed largely in Canada
and the States, are an innovation on the
Spencer-street (Melb.) railway platforms. The
new vehicles strike terror into Mum, Dad and
the family, aid-inky, little bell being the only
warning when one of the juggernauts ap-
proaches with its unwieldy mountain of lug-
gage, surmounted by a porter, the whole car-
ried on wheels about -the size of a shilling.
“G.B.”; I found the good Australian word
“mate” on a gravestone in Port Moresby
eemetery. A marble slab has bem placed
there by his friends to the memory of the
bite William Little, so well known in the
history of Papua, and on it I read
Brave Pioneer.
True Mate.
Universally Loved.
The usual “text” which follows looks super-
fluous after that.
”Ivohe”: When 1 sold my store at Walron-
goinata I confided to Henare that his friend
Ropata. over at > Ruatangata, owed me
£10, and made him a sporting offer of £8 if
he could collect the debt for me. It was 11
months before I saw Henare again. "You
didn t manage to collect that £10 from Ro-
pata, I remarked. “Oh, res,” said Henare,
1 make Ropata pay orright.” "Well,
where s my half?” I demanded. "Oh, .1 Cut
get your half,” said Henare, genially, “I on’y
make Ropata pay te half for me.”
W hile the present miscalled Labor (govern-
ment in Queensland has so contrived it
that its supporters are revelling, despite bad
times and financial depression, in largely-
increased salaries, it is recalled that
ivobeit I hiip, in a time not nearly so
calamitous as the present, cut down
the salaries of himself and liis Minis-
teis so that a retrenched Public Service
might at least, see that the Government’s
desire for economy was honest. Morgan and
Kidston continued this custom of reduced
Ministerial salaries by way of following a
good example. The present crowd explains
the action by saying that Philp and Morgan
re 1 , , If Labor weren’t so seif-
blinded it wouldn't be so eager to associate
lory ism and the virtue of economy. In
r>i m 1 "’ better d »ys Labor’s idea was that
I blip was a Tory because he didn’t econo-
mise hai'd enough.
“Bilhav”: Like “T.W.” (B. 21/11/’21 i I
!; 111 across the Yiddish Battalions (38th
and odtli Roval lusiliers). It was at the
lommy i_ patriation camp, Morn Hill, 'Win-
chester, in 1919. The camp contained men
trom the four corners of the earth waiting to
be sent borne, and there were some' pretty
haid cases among them. One lot in particu-
lar was a batch of British West Indians, big.
hefty niggers, and when a few South Africans
blew m they were put alongside the nigs., in
the mess-room. The S’Africans objected to
messing with colored gents, and that started
the trouble. TheYids egged the S’Africans
on, and the first bowl of hot coffee hurled by
a darkle caught one of them on the jaw
I andemonium broke loose, arid that mess-
room soon looked as if a fleet of tanks had
strolled through it. The Yids bolted, barring
their casualties, and left the to
right it out alone. My mob wasn’t in it —as 1
one big nig put it, "We. got no quar’l wid
you, Stralia.” The Yids arid S’Africans were
besieged in their huts for the rest of the dav
as no one cared to tackle the job of removing
the besiegers. The following morning the
darkies were drafted to another camp., There
were a couple of dozen casualties all told,
six of them serious.
‘•The Oldest Inhabitant”: A portrait of
William John Wills, the companion of ex-
plorer Burke, has been presented to the
Mitchell Library. The donor is Nahum
Barnett, architect, who received it from the
original owner, Richard Birnie, M.A., to
whom W ills gave it on leaving with the expe-
dition. Wills did not start from Melbourne
as second in command; that post was held
by G. J. Landells, who had brought the
camels fiom India. At Menindie, however,
a difference arose between Burke and Lan-
dells and the latter returned to Melbourne,
the leader appointing Wills as second in
command. Wills’s original job was that of
astronomer. Richard Birnie was a man a
century behind his time. He was son of
Richard Birnie, the Bow-street magistrate
and a Cambridge M.A. Called at Inner
Temple in ’33 he practised at Old Bailey
as a criminal lawyer, and in ’54 was given
the job of Advocate-General in Westralia.
He acted as Judge for a year, then came to
Vic. in 1859 and occasionally acted as Crown
Prosecutor. He made no mark at the Bar
but was mainly known by his essays, nub-
lished in the Australasian. Occasionally
he lectured, but never could attract large
audiences. He had a sort of connection with
Botany Bay as his father, who was ori<n-
rially a saddler, succeeded in detecting and
hunting down the Cato-,street conspirators
three of whom came to N. S. Wales as
“guests.”

V
i>A
If you are fond of drawing you can
easily be taught how to make money in
your own home. There is such a constant
demand for new sketches that persons of
very moderate ability earn good fees.
But to get the best results you should
learn direct from a successful artist.
Under Mr. J. C. Bancks, the well-known
cartoonist and caricaturist, and by his easy
system of lessons by post, many persons
of both sexes are now being trained to
do money-earning sketches.
Mr. Bancks himself supervises every
student’s work and personally corrects
and advises them by letter on each lesson.
Why Don’t
YOU Learn?
The Bancks School gives the finest prac-
tical instruction to be had in Australia,
and the terms are very easy.
Send your name and address (with 3d.
in stamps for postage), and the booklet
“Art that Pays” will be posted to you.. It
tells you all about the School. If you can
already draw a little and you like to send
a specimen of your work (either original
or a copy) Mr. Bancks will be very pleased
to write you his opinion of it— free.
But write for the book now, and judge
for yourself.

Shell Lubricating Oils assure you get-

of your car.
Shell Motor Spirit
is the only spirit with a twenty (20)
years’ continuous record of successes
for' mileage, purity, pace and power.
These four factors are essential
adjuncts to enjoyable motoring. The
user of Shell Motor Spirit never
worries; he knows that wherever and
whenever purchased, he gets the same
pure, sweet spirit, the spirit adopted
as the World’s Standard.
Shell is as pure to-day as it was
twenty years ago; just as powerful;
just as dependable; just as superior.
“The OH that

OYTINUOUS, unfailing good

greater pleasure, less expense; these
naturally follow the use of Shell
Lubricating Oils.
Shell Motor Oils
are the highest expression of scientific
lubrication. Do the mere letters of
the alphabet denote to you in any way
whatever the consistency of Lubricat-
ing Oils? We think not. Your car
requires an oil of either light, medium
or Heavy body, and to simplify identifi-
cation ShMi Lubricating Oils are
graded accordingly. Ask for Shell

Another helping of "Maytime” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney, strengthens the impres-
sion that if the writer of the book and lyrics
isn’t grateful to Arnold Bennett she ought
to be. It may be overstating the case to say
that “Maytime” is just “Milestones” Ameri-
canised and set to music, but in essentials
it is more like “Milestones” than “The
Chocolate Soldier” resembles “Arms and the
Map.” However, the sincere flatterer of
Bennett has turned her borrowed materials
to good account. Her play is sentimental,
but the sentiment is mostly agreeable, and
it doesn’t lack for either charm or humor.
The music is pleasant, the dress-parades are
quaint, and the company at Her Majesty’s
does the thing excellently, Leslie Holland
particularly so. Holland’s impersonation of.
Matthew Van Zandt, the beau who believes
in marrying early and often, is his finest
to date. He is good in the youthful phase,
better ill middle-age, best of all as an un-
conquerable nonagenarian making swift love
to a brisk young actress, well played by
Mione Stewart. On the other hand, Gladys
Moherieff is admirable as the maiden Ottiile
and not so admirable as Ottiile grown old—
she makes the character much too austere.
Reginald Roberts, reappearing after a long
absence from Sydney, is a vigorous and con-
vincing Richard Wayne. Others in the pic-
ture are Georgia Harvey, Mira Kenham, Ger-
trude Boswell, Nell Payne, Roy Redgrave,
Percy Claridge, John Forde,. Phil Smith and
a clever youngster, Blossom Edrnends. And
Jessie Sherwood, with her attendant bal-
lerinas, scores a palpable hit.

_ “Going Up” is a favorite of Sydney’s, and
since it was revived at the Royal on Satur-
day night-a large section of the population
has been humming the familiar music and
repeating the well-remembered jokes. Alf
Frith and Field Fisher appear in their old
parts of the fraudulent birdman and his
accomplice, the mechanician. Maude Fane
is the 'alleged aviators sweetheart, and a
very bright and lively one. Cecil Kellaway
is tlie incorrigible punter, Madge Elliot the
telephone girl who dances as few Hello ladies
can, and Cecil Bradley, Cyril Ritehards,
Raul Plunkett, Rita Nugent and Jack
Hooker aid and abet them in their task of
counteracting the dismal impressions pro-
duced by the Lang income-tax. “Going Up”
will go on for another week.
An absent-minded wheat-dabbler and a
price-fixing inquiry are the chucklesome tit-
bits in “Courtland,” the newest topical bur-
lesque wedged into “The Frolics of 1921”
at Sydney Tivoli. The vaudeville section
carries the hallmark of approval—Ada
Cerito’s Cockney turns and Claude Dam-
per’s tomfoolery see to that. Taking them
all round, this house now boards as good a
collection of comedians, singers and dancers
as it has had for months and months.

all that is left to him is a stray bullpup
and the cold street. But is he down-hearted ?
No! Fate hands him over to the leader of
the Civic Reformers,, and that’s where he
makes as many disclosures as a jazz-party.
At the Strand Marguerite Clarke throws off
the yoke and becomes the chief ingredient
in “Scrambled Wives,” and William Des-
mond puts up a dashing heart-winning ex-
ploit as “The Broadway Cowboy.” Hoyt’s,
Haymarket, and Piccadilly assure the world
“You can’t Kill Love.” Captain Frank
Hurley’s “Pearls and Savages” - is luring the
romance-hunter and the adventure-lover to
the Globe this week. Hurley’s photography
needs no recommendation, and the heathen
in his blindness is portrayed from his haunts
in Thursday Island to the roof of Papua.
Frank Harvey is again inhabiting the yel-
low dressing-gown of Frank Devereux in
“The Sign on the Door” "t Melbourne Royal.
Harvey’s reappearance now gives “Lafe”
Regan (William Kelly) more justification
for his virtuous outburst, and also res cm .
the ginger to nlaces from which it was
banished by the previous Lothario. Ray-
mond Lawrence has returned to the old busi-
ness of elegantly chaperoning a tennis racquet
-—a job he pursues with a face in mourning
and a plaintive note in his elocution.
At Melbourne King’s “Mr. Pirn Passes
By” continues to make a special appeal to
people who have no ear for American drama
or musical shows. Nowadays it is a treat
to inspect a plot without a revolver or a
telephone in it; and it is such things that
count for virtues in the restful comedy of
“Mr. Pim.” Meantime there is growing
public interest in the curtain-raiser, “The
Dumb and the Blind.” It is generally felt
that Joe and Liz solve a domestic problerrt
that is not unknown in higher walks of life.
* * :::
“Merrie England,” at Melbourne Majes-
ty’s, continues to trifle with history and
make unfounded accusation against the
sanity of Raleigh and good Queen Bess.
Raleigh is a particularly foolish person who
employs the disguise of a shave in trying to
dodge the Queen’s wrath, while the monarch
is maae ridiculous before her subjects by the
introduction of an alleged spook in Windsor
r orest. The idea of inventing a phantom to
tnghten Bess into clemency is one of the
worst liberties taken with the lady’s reputa-
tion. She might consent to shudder at
ghosts in private, but showing funk in public
was never a royal failing, and in presenting
her thus librettist Basil Hood has robbed
her of a lot of personality.

, Tivoli programme,® which is
still headlined by Elba Shields, was further
improved on Saturday by the addition of
Edward Cahill and George Brooke, Cabin
spanking the piano in a masterful solo and
later providing unimpeachable accompani-
ments for Brooke’s tasteful “Roses in
l icardy” and other sweet songs; Both
artists scored a success which might have
been greater if the restless Tivoli orchestra
had not furnished some superfluous musical
support for Brooke’s first number. Of
other recent arrivals Maurice Sterndale re-
quires most reproof for jazzing on the violin
and calling into action cowbell and other
depressing effects.

Two ladies on exhibition :
The retrospective exhibition, which Hans Heysen
threatens to make fashionable, has found an admirer
in Violet Teague, who spreads her canvases at Mel-
bourne Athenaeum. But the works have not been
carefully selected. For one thing, Miss. Teague
hangs too many student efforts, in which the
young brush in, obviously groping for expression;
and in the examples of a somewhat later period—
female virtuosos curving over pianos, insipid Sas-
siety ladies in dowdy raiment, and a towering
dowager with the tail of a bygone skirt posed in
foreground—the work is often marred by faults of
color and drawing. The performance is greater in
portraits of Hal Teague, Captain D. G. M. Teague,
I{. 0. Blackwood and Professor Laurie, the handling
being vigorous in comparison with her early style.
Her “Welcome News from the Front,” which,
according to its date, refers to the Boer disturbance,
is florid genre- painting in her second-best manner.
But criticism remains dumb before her altar piece,
The Adoration of the Shepherds.” It was evi-
dently inspired by some tragedy of the late war,
and its sentiment therefore protects it. Half a wall
is devoted to seascapes, but Miss Teague hasn’t any
aptitude for this form of art.
Miss Cumbrae Stewart’s show at the Queen’s Hall,
Melbourne, includes a number of pastel nudes which
have not lost the habit of turning their backs on
the critic. But even among the divinities drawn
from more interesting angles there is li-ttle in the
performance but the romantic exaggeration of flesh
tones and the production of graceful contours to
catch the eye. No doubt they are all very pretty
and the drawing is convincing, but idealised damsels,
posed in attitudes that have grown classic with
repetition, make one almost long for cruder domestic
types with large red hands and charwomen’s knees.
These at least would have some reality about them.
It is a pity Miss Stewart devotes so much time to
the polite art of pastels wher. she is capable of
greater work in oils. There ..re some cool land-
scapes—;“Mt. Wellington from Bellerive,” for in-
stance —that provide some relief from the confection-
ery aforesaid. Likewise “Dors d’u'ne Fille’’ is worth
an honorable mention. The lady’s back is’flesh and
blood, while the modelling of the shoulder is unim-
peachable. And “The Mauve Frock,” hung in a
special position, is handled with masculine strength.
* ».! SI! *
Melbourne Majestic is engaged this week
in filming "The Foolish Matrons,” which
depicts the effect of marriage on three young
females of widely different views and tem-
peraments. The other subject on the pro-
gramme is_ the detective drama, “The Wake-
field Case,” the solution whereof is worthy
of Sherlock Holmes. The leading subject
at Hoyt’s is “Remorseless Love,” which re-
ports another Kentucky feud, with lovely
Elaifie Hammerstein in the thick of it.
Lower down in popular estimation is
“Wolves of the North,” an Arctic exposure
of crude villainy wherein an avalanche plays
a wicked nart. The hatchet face of Bill
Hart is glowing with virtuous purpose in
“The Whistle” at the Melba; and Herbert
Eawlinson is the benevolent hero in the
screen version of “Passers By” at the
Britannia.

Stfi l show has blossomed out on
St. Kilda Esplanade (Melb.). Pierrot
Punch opened a few nights ago at
tne Lyric with a party. The Lyric
is a huge barn of a place that has
been remodelled into dress-circle and stalls
and a stage with two black velvet curtains;
and the Pierrot Punchers, with Rawdon
Blandford in the lead, make a sandwich of
higli-brow music and popular jazz tunes and
vaudeville song - . It’s a delightfully mixed
affair that goes with a thumping briskness
from overture to Gorsave.

The Diggers are back at St. Kilda with a
fine menu of Aussie humor and talent.
Their sketches and ouips come mainly from
“Orchid,” which is the i.om-d : e-plume of two
brothers whose bent in this direction has
only found expression since the war. They
were Diggers themselves, arad with sure
hands they pin down Billjim’s incomparable
humor. It is the real thing The Diggers
supply at the big tent of Wyckliffe House,
and there is often the little quick catch of
pathos in it.

From an Adelaide critic:—
The official war photographs now on view at the
Jubilee Exhibition make a wonderful show. En-
larged anywhere up to, in some cases, almost life
size, they give, pictorially, the truest idea we have
yet had of life in the trenches. The mud is un-
speakable; curiously enough a portrait of war-
correspondent Bean (back view) in a narrow trench
bears the simple title “Mud.” Wounded are seen
in dressing-stations, “resting” men busy playing
two-up are snapped just as they lived, and an elabo-
rate system of indexing enables any relative to find
any picture in which Billjim appears, and to buy a
copy of it enlarged to any size desired. More care-
fully artistic are the Palestine pictures, showing
landscapes of Bethlehem or the Sea of Galilee, or
Damascus, with the Light Horse at work. Realistic
or artistic, they are a thrilling sight. Sydney is to
see them next.
From London Max Pirani sends news of
recitals given with considerable success in
Switzerland and Vienna.' Lady Northcliffe
lias been feteing him, and at her week-end
parties he has played to many blue-blooded
enthusiasts who predict a rosy future for
the young Melbourne pianist-composer.

From a man in Elizabeth-street, Brisbane:
I bought a pound of chops at the State butchery
this evening, and when I got home I found that, in
addition to the regulation white paper, they were
encased in two pages of The Bulletin for June 2,
1894. On one side was a series of “Hop’s” cartoon-
lets depicting the latest development of Billy Lane's
New Australia, and on the other side there was a
notice and photo, of sculptor E. Bertram Mackennal,
then a very young chiseller. The last sentence of
the notice road: “For a genius who- thus gets into
‘the swim’ there should be a brilliant time coming,
and The Bulletin has secret misgivings that the
subject of this notice may one day lack the strength
of mind necessary to repudiate a knighthood.” I’d
like to have this recorded among the prophecies
that have reached complete fulfilment.
The love of music for music’s sake is
threatened with extinction by the opposing
schools of musical thought. It is only the
Philistine who is capable of judging a Dlayer
or vocalist without bias. In Melbourne, dis-
ciples of each school have nothing but scorn
for those who worship at rival musical
shrines. This was loudly evidenced at the
Verbrugghen concerts. Each little section
fiercely applauds any performance which con-
forms to the tenets of its own particular
musical creed, and sits coldly disdainful
while their rivals applaud their stars. The
performer who belongs to no local sect has
to depend on the merely musical gallery for
appreciation. If Galli Curci were to come
here under an assumed name she would have
her voice and vocal culture torn to pieces
by the really musical, although the merely
musical might howl out with delight.' Yes,
indeed, the Gollites. the Verbrugghenites
the East Melbourne Conites and all the other
ites would kill music, surely but slowly,
if there were no Philistine commonsense to
make them, in a great measure, harmless.

regarded as exclusive to high-priced machines. In
introducing the
n
Hornless and
Horn Models
We can emphatically state that never
has such value been offered for the
moderate prices quoted. Each model
has a perfect tone and full volume.
The motor (which is the “heart of
any instrument) is a specially chosen
one, and the cabinets are symmetrical
in appearance and made of well-
seasoned quarter-cut golden oak.
Such quality as this has been practi-
cally impossible up to the present at
anything like these prices, but by
“quantity buying and making” we are
able to bring down the price so that
it will be possible to have
“A Reg'al in Every Home.”
iz
This Model No. 1 has an astonishingly clear
and full tone and good appearance. It is
the most compact instrument and the largest
sized one at or near the price. It is large
enough to grace the sitting-room of the
bungalow home, yet is light enough to trans-
port to the week-end camp or a friend's
•'social evening.” It has single spring motor,
30in. Turntable, back-fitting Tone-arm, Eng-
lish-made Regal Sound Box, set in a Cabinet
of Golden Oak, size 16$ by 14$ by 7 inches.
A real “Multum in parvo” much-m-little in-
strument that will give universal satisfac-
tion and years of enjoyment.
PRICE £4 at your music-dealer’s.
&
&
Model 2 is the lowest-priced instrument
equipped with a 12in. Turntable. Its tone
is'clear and full of volume, permitting every
pianissimo tone and every full expression as
captured by the record- to be expressed as
naturally as the singer sings, or the instru-
mentalist performs. It has a reliable
Double-Spring Worm-gear Motor, 12in.
Turntable, Nickel Tone-arm and Back
Bracket, English-made Ilegal Sound-box,
Cabinet of Oak (wax finish), fitted with
louvres and double doors; size Ini by Inf
by Si inches.
’ PRICE £7/10/- at your dealer's.

Model No. 3 is made for those who value the swelling tones
provided by the Horn-type of instrument. It has a well-
balanced appearance and a wonderful volume. The Model is
fitted with single-spring motor. 10-inch Turntable ENGLISH-
MADE REGAL SOUNDBOX and Fancy Horn, 20-inch.
PRICE £5/10/ - at your dealer’s.

Ivan Caryll, most prolific of musical-
comedy composers, died in New York a few
days ago. In his younger years he was con-
nected with the London Gaiety, but he
crossed the Atlantic 10 years ago and stayed
there —cosmopolitan N’York saved him the
trouble of wandering from city to city, as he
had been in the habit of doing in Europe.
“The Earl and the Girl’’ was one of his
earlier efforts; later ones known to Aus-
tralia included “Our Miss Gibbs,’’ “Kissing
Time,” “The Orchid” and “The Girl from
Kay’s.” There must have been at least a
score in his tally.
“Wodgil”: Verbrugghen scandalised Syd-
ney musical critics of the precious school by
inviting the Newcastle Steel Works Band to
play at a Saturday-night concert. The little
“The Sign on the
Door,” at Melbourne
King's.
William J. Kelly as
“Lafe”, Regan.
Belgian heard the
steelworkers at Bal-
larat, where he
judged the South-
street competitions,
and was honestly
amazed at the
beauty of their
work and that of
the Malvern (Yic.)
band, but to the
critics aforesaid
the idea of mere
Australian bapds-
men playing
Beethoven and
Tschaikqwsky is a
deuced insult to the
old Mastahs. And
their opinion was
evidently shared by
a large section of
the alleged music-
loving public, for
the Town Hall, to
which crowds of
hysterical mugs
flocked a few
months ago to have
their legs pulled b.v
alleged Russian
geniuses, was half-
empty. Anyhow,
the Newcastle men
played brilliantly,
and Bert Baile,
their conductor,
handled them like
an artist. But
what a lot of hum-
bug and flim-flam there is in Sydney’s atti-
tude to music.
“Chev”: Lismore (N.S.W.) is bent on
following Melbourne’s “music-week” idea.
The North Coast is curiously musical, and
Lismore leads easily. As a matter of fact,
it won’t be long before the supremacy of
Ballarat in musical festivals is challenged
by the Cow Capital, which made such a
big success of its last festival that it is
increasing the prize money for 1922 to £6OO.
Already Verbrugghen has been asked to do
the judging.
“The Star Understudy”: When the Wil-
liamson stage-managers, most of whom have
graduated from the ranks of minor mum-
mers, take a turn at acting, they never fail
to score honors. Thus whenever Victor
Tatnall, of the Joseph Coyne co., leaves the
prompt corner to mingle amongst fun-
makers before the footlights, he holds his
own with the best of them, as was evidenced
afresh recently in “Hit-the-Trail Holliday.”
Reg Carey, too, has proved himself over and
over again an excellent actor, as his father
was before him. Thomas Foster, now with
O’Hara, has likewise given some excellent
characterisations when called upon. And
Alfred Andrew, s.-m. of the Royal Comics,
has frequently “gone on” at short notice
for the principal comedy part in a musical
show in place of the high-priced button-
buster from overseas, and people in front
haven’t known the difference.
Freddie Shipman has got on to a new line.
Encouraged bv the success of the invasion of
concert-performers during the past couple of
years, he and his friends have formed a co.
to import them in larger quantities. Harry
Musgrove and that good amateur enter-
tainer Alfred Edward, lately superintendent
of police, are Shipman’s co.-directors, and
they will see him off by an early English
mailboat with hope in his eye and alluring
draft contracts in his pocket.
“Whitebait”: Owing to the generosity of
conductor Slapoffski in the matter of encores
you get too much “Merrie England” at
Melbourne Majesty’s. It may be right
enough to let Strella Wilson sing a favored
item over again, but when every warbler
gives a double helping, the ear is surfeited
and the attention flags. The other night I
heard almost the whole show twice, and if the
repetitions continue orchestra and chorus, if
not principals, will have to claim overtime in
self-defence. They are being paid for eight
performances a week, and are giving over a
dozen. ,
“First Old Man”: Godfrey Tearle, the
leading man engaged by Hugh J. Ward to
star here next year in his original part in
“The Garden of Allah,” etc., will be the
third mummer of the same surname to visit
Australia under the Williamson segis. Con-
way was the first “Ben Hur” in this coun-
try, and Malcolm played lead in “Joseph
and His Brethren” (the Louis Parker ver-
sion). Godfrey is as effective in Shakspeare
as in modern rOles. Australia has been
waiting a good while for an actor of his
calibre.
“E.T.”: H. F. Maltby, the author of “The
Laughter of Fools,” now in the bill at Syd-
ney Palace, is not exactly a stranger to
Australian boards. Less than a year and a
half ago, at Melbourne Princess’s, Allan
Wilkie staged an earlier comedy of his,
“The Rotters,” which, now that the first-
named has been so favorably received, would
doubtless be welcomed in Sydney. Maltby*
is an actor-dramatist who had a long struggle
for recognition in England, but constant
pegging away has brought its reward in
the shape of so many commissions that he
has little time for mumming now.
“L.L.W.”; Referring to Mrs. Dale’s re-
pertory play, “Secondary Considerations”
(B. 1/12/’2l), Gregan McMahon did not
choose it out of 200-odd Australian works
sent in to him. Not 100 were sent. He
chose four plays—two by L. L. Woolacott
(of .Aussie) , one by Louis Stone and one
by Mrs. Dale. Louis Stone’s was ruled out
for first production by reason of the difficul-
ties of staging and casting it; Woolacott’s
longer play was temporarily put in the
background because the producer could not
get a cast for it so near Christmas; and
McMahon Tell back on “Secondary Consider-
ations.”
“Cornstalk”: Recent references to G. and
S. cranks remind me of a young northern
suburbs (Syd.) musician who trained two
boy-scout troops (about 80 all told) in ex-
cerpts from the G. and S. series, including
“lolanthe,” “Gondoliers,” “Pirates” and
“Pinafore,” as well as several other old
operas. His idea was to encourage the boys
to whistle these tunes in lieu of rag-mush.
It worked, too, for if you find these boys
afloat or in the bush you’ll hear them full-
steam ahead on one or other of the old melo-
dies.
“E.”: Cromwell follows Abraham Lin-
coln and Mary Stuart as the central figure
of a John Drinkwater biographical play.
The man who closed the theatres seems a
queer hero for a literary drama. Yet a
Cromwell play was produced in London in
1872, with George Rignold in the star part.
Handsome George as the Arch-Puritan pro-
vided good sport behind the scenes, at any
rate.
“Wart”: A cable the other day 'mentioned
that the management and actors responsible
for “Reigen” (“The Circle”), by Arthur
Sehnitzler, had been acquitted in Berlin after
a fortnight’s trial. The prosecution claimed
that the play was immoral, and that the
music between the acts was also dangerous
o public health. “Reigen” was written over
“0 y ea y s ago, but Schnitzler refused to allow
it to be staged. The curtain rises on a
street prostitute bargaining with a soldier:
the second scene is between the soldier and
a housemaid ; the third between the house-
maid and the son of her employer—and so
on until the tenth scene, completing the
Circle is an incident between a high official
and the original prostitute. The men treat
the incidents as trivial, the women, of course,
as things of overwhelming importance.
Mid : You seem to do it differently in
Aussie, if ‘Morob’s” tale of the hanging actor
(R. 0/11/ 21) is correct. Elsewhere the
lightest mummer can hang by the neck and
retain the capacity for living. The victim,
hero or villain wears a brace-like contrap-
tion of strong webbing (usually an old pair
of braces reconstructed) under his outer gar-
ment. Attached to this is a spring hook,
and at the top end of the noose is another.
As the gloating executioner slips the cord
around the jugular he simply clips the hooks
and the business proceeds. The victim is in
no danger unless he and the avenger are
sweet on the same girl.
“Stargazer”: My experience is that the
good film is never mentioned. The American
tripe is boosted, but the excellent thing one
hits on now and again appears to be wholly
an inadvertence. I have had the luck lately
to strike “The Scarab,” an Italian film, and
a foolishly-named Scandinavian picture,
“The Bonds that Chafe,” neither of them
big-lettered. Yet “The Scarab” makes
American photography look cheap, and the
leading lady makes one hopeful that screen-
acting will yet be a respected art, instead of
a mere concoction of tricks; while the Swe-
dish play is both a miracle of good photog-
raphy and a triumph of superb acting.
The trombone-player’s story :
Our artist was singing in a small hall, in a N. S.
Wales bucolic centre, and presently complained that
an open window near the platform was letting in a
blast of cold air that threatened to freeze her upper
register into a solid block. The manager put the
window down, but the catch was broken, and pre-
sently the sash was up again. Once more he put the
“THE LAUGHTER OF FOOLS” AT
SYDNEY PALACE.
J. B. Atholwood as Mr. Nuttall, of
Nuttall and Noakes.
window down, but within a few minutes Madame was
raging’ about the wintry blast. This time the man-
ager borrowed the hall-keeper’s bull-terrier, nearly
as big as a calf, and chained him up under the
window, confident ' that he would eat the rascals whc
were partaking of Madame’s performance surrepti-
tiously. Madame was at it again, when up went the
window once more. Madame paused. “Will you
please kill that fellow?” she appealed with bitter-
ness, pointing a tragic finger at the window. But
the window went up and up, and 50 people screamed
when a terrible countenance appeared in the gap. A
bull-terrier fought his way through the opening and
fell into the room, where he-hung, gurgling, on the
end of his chain. The dog was the sole offender.
The hall had long been his sleeping place, and he
was accustomed to enter by the broken window
which he opened for himself with his nose.
“Ya-rra B.”: Charming Pollock, whose
“Sign on the Door” is at Melbourne Royal,
is one of the oldest critics and playwrights
in New York. A month or two ago he went
across to London to produce “The Sign”
for Gladys Cooper at the Playhouse, and
had a great first-night reception. The
drama, by the way, when originally staged
in America, was called “A Room at the
Ritz.” It is evidently destined for the
movies.
“Middle B.”; Nellie Ferguson, who used
to be Nellie Ogden, made her “first appear-
ance” at three. She played Dickens’s Joe
at five or thereabouts. But that’s nothing.
The company never needed a prompter when
Nellie was in the corner. She knew every-
one’s part as well as her own.
“Ganesha”: Can any new thrill be ob-
tained in melodrama by the old poker stunt.
In Conan Doyle’s “The Speckled Band” the
audience is still held spellbound when the
villain bends the poker to show his strength
—the poker that subsequently reveals itself
as india-rubber. This modern use of the old
“Maytime” at Sydney
Majesty's.

Richard Wayne.
trick seems feeble
compared with the
more robustious
effort I saw in a
low-brow music-
hall. There was a
stage-fight with
re al pokers, the
artists frequently
banging the table
to let the audi-
ence know that
they were real. At
the climax the
hero substituted a
property poker,
to which was
attached a blad-
der fi 11 e d with
“rose pink.” In
the thick of the
fight he banged it
over the villain’s
head with such
force that it bent
—screams from the
ladies —a nd, the
bladder bursting,
the villain was
covered with
streams of gore, a
daringly artistic
effort that startled
the imagination of
the most callous
bottle-o. But we
seldom see these great dramatic effects nowa-
days, there is too much talk.
“Dollar Mark”: I wonder how these
“fabulous salaries” paid by Australian man-
agements to Amurkan mummers (B.
3/11/’2l) leak out? The bosses, I am sure,
do their best to keep the matter dark. I
think the actors must tell one another.
“Sixenate”: Garrick Smithers, playing
lead with the Beerheemians, was pardon-
ably proud one night of the applause that
came from a seat in the stalls during his
scene with Wallington Bosco, the villain.
Next day the middle-aged woman who had
provided the enthusiasm called on him. “It
was grand to see the way you handled tha/.
wretch,” she said, warmly. “He takes some
handling, too. Do you think you could
make him pay me what he owes for board?”
“Stargazer”: Two slim Italians in one
of our latest grand opera cos. were reputed
to be deadly enemies. They gritted their
teeth whenever they came within yards of
each other, and their flashing orbs had at-
tracted the attention of the press. One day
they came together in the corridor of a Mel-
bourne hotel and opened an attack. Each
was armed with a small cane, and they used
these as rapiers might be used in a stage
duel. It was most impressive to see
the two circling * like fighting cocks, cut-
ting, stabbing and parrying. Then Signor
Polonio sustained a thrust in the nose, and
dropping his cane with a howl buried his
bleeding proboscis in his handkerchief, while
Signor Bandana withdrew triumphantly to
his apartihent. Ten minutes later Poionio
was knocking furiouslv at his enemy’s door,
and on being admitted systematically assailed
Bandana. He kicked the lyric tenor five
times, and when done ejaculated from the
door: “We agree to be enemies. Yes, good.
It ees for the advertisement. But a poke
in the nose, eet iss not agree. No!” And
the vindicated warbler went down to lunch.
BUSH REVERIE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are folks whose constant clamor is that bush
life holds a glamor,
Compensating for all drawbacks. Well, I’ll sell
mine if they’ll buy;
For, although it may sound silly, I’m in love with
Piccadilly
With the orchestra a-tuning in the East Room at
the Cri.
I’ll admit that there was no man dressed a salad
like the Roman ;
That the joints wheeled round at Simpson’s still
are far from tough or dry;
But for saintly man or sinner you can’t beat the
little dinner
That they serve on Sunday evenings in the East
Room at the Cri.,
With the candles’ golden glowing on the shapely
shoulders showing,
While the popping of champagne-corks makes the
watchful waiters fly,
As you gaze across the napery at the sheen of skin
and drapery
Which is found in rich abundance in the East
Room at the Cri.
But the billy must be boiling—one grows thirsty
after toiling—
And in moody meditation you may watch the
flapjacks fry,
While the mutton, greasy, fatty, makes you murmur
“Shades of Gatti!”
Drop me somewhere east of “Jimmy’s” and ad-
jacent to the Cri.

THEIR APPRECIATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Flam’s thoughts were centred on the stage;
Strange dreams were in his stage-struck heart:
He saw his talents’ heritage
When Strander handed him a part.
He visioned how the audience-pack
Rose in emotion strong, the cause
His acting in the part of Jack —
The whole house rocked with loud applause.
Alas, alack! they opened in
A town of most Woop-Woopish mien,
Whose dwellings seem the most part tin,
With pebbled roadways strewn between;
And when he saw the playhouse there—
A rambling shanty full of flaws—
Flam thought (it filled him with despair)
The house might well rock with applause.
Wherever stones on roadsides grew,
Or lie round loose for hand to move,
Man’s great ability to throw
He ever practises to prove.
Flam’s acting was not very good,
And, shortly, striking without pause,
Stones fell about him where he stood ;
The whole house rocked—with wild applause.

Jerry Sullivan, who has never allowed a
referee to catch him on the floor for 10 seconds
was again saved by the towel on Saturday night’
while gamely trying to weather -the 12th round
against Louis Garcia at Sydney Stadium. In Louis
the hidalgo, with his easy-going doctrine of vianana,
has been swamped in the strenuous Argonaut of Cali-
fornia.; Direct action and plenty- of it is the motto
of this rock-faced Mexican scion of Old Spain.
Attacking Sullivan from the jump' without the slight-
est respect for his reputation as a heftv- ljitter and
one of the cleverest ring' artists in the Obinmoii-'
wealth, he soon -had the local -lad in trouble. By
the ninth round- both Sullivan’s eyes were, more or
less 1 out of action; and* this" was nothing to what
he was getting about the ribs .arid stomach. All

heavily, times well and is fast, and he has something:
of the persistence which was one of Les Darcy's chief
assets. Even Jamito, of the concrete jaw, would find
him dangerous to the closing seconds of the 20th
round.

A -right to the mark floored Demsky, the
Queensland fedder, in the first round of his fight
with the American Goozeman, on Saturday night,
and the crowd in the Melbourne Stadium looked un-
happy. Down he went again in the second spasm,
through the agency of a right to the throat, and
a gentleman with a broken nose called upon Jehovah
to blind him if so brief a massacre was worth
“twenny-one-an’-eight.” But the Northerner gath-
ered up his scattered wits and fought back, reso-
lutely and well. He won the points of the third,
fifth and sixth rounds, and in the seventh landed so
vigorous a wallop on a tough jaw that Goozeman
was momentarily “out on his feet.” But Demsky
moved in too slowly and the golden moment passed.
And it never came again. In the eighth round the
Yank presented Mr. Demsky with a specific for
insomnia, and thereby ended a most exciting con-
troversy.

Burton, captain of Wellington
(M.L.) XI, playing against Institute the other dav,
piled up 128 not out (out of 327), and took "2
wickets for .3. In three innings this season he has
scored 35, 203 not out and 128 not out—an average,
of 366. Button is adjudged the finest batsman seen
m the Dominion since J. N. Crawford made Such a
noise there. - 4
A waterlogged wicket made scoring diffi-
the Bananaland-N.S.W. match that started
at Brisbane on Saturday. Sid Redgrave (a Shore
contemporary of the Duffs), who controls a medium
bieak both ways, had the N. S. Welshmen guessing,
and got the three wickets that fell on the day for
16 runs. On the Monday, however, he met with no
success. Page, whose batting was brightest for the
Northerners, stopped a threatened rot, and the subse-
quent batsmen helped themselves to Russell and
Forssberg. After the departure of Achurch (37) and
Boyce (50), Hornibrook (3 for 38) and the slow
•bowler Ayres (4 for. 50) tumbled the visitors out
neck and crop andjeft them 37 runs behind, in the
Northerners’ second knock Redgrave again failed,
but the wicket becoming easy, all the batsmen
played with confidence, and at the drawing of stumps
Bananaland was 187 runs ahead and six wickets
to the good, with Sheppard, their crack bat, 54 n.o.
The mixed weather-samples that-have'been
afflicting Sydney grade-crieketers practically since
the beginning of the season have' not" handicapped
the more experienced players as they have the
younger and more orthodox school. Witness the
success, Saturday after Saturday, of Dr. Poidevin.
Playing for Waverley against Sydney last Saturday
he was never at loss for a stroke and was not out
61. Rupe Minnett, another old timer, in getting 70
for Mosman against Paddington, played as well as
when he was Norths’ star bat. And Gee, for Manly,
came back with 37 out of his side’s 7 for 103
against Gordon. KeUeway, at present the big boy
in little cricket, worked havoc among ‘ the Bal-
niainiaes, seven of whom fell to him for 49. . Thomas
(A 9) was the only one who attempted to play, him.
Glebe, however, with Bogle away. are a poor batting
side. Sydney thudded for 61 against Comber (4
for 27) and Ives (6 for 34), of Waverley, who
bowled unchanged. The Boneyarders then scooped
lip 239 for 7. Caswell hit all round the wicket for 81.
Mosman, with 193 for 5, may decide to take-a-sporting
chance and declare against Paddington next Saturday.
Petersham soon got 'St. George out, A. Emerv (37)
and' Freeman (21) alone being able to negotiate
Campbell (4 for 42) and Crane (3 for 13). The
former is at present in great form. Manly stfick
in against Gordon and may give Diamond’s men a
ran for their money. The wicket at Marrickville
suited express-bowler Scott, and he made things hufn
against ’Varsity, The fieldsmen were, however, in
a relenting mood. Rock (39 n. 0.) remained in until
play stopped. Uni. are 3 for 65. In an hour C.
Cumberland lost 3 for 73—a1l to Parnell. Gar
Waddy batted like a house and is 25 n.o. Norths
played long enough to lose two wickets to Rand-
wick. Punch fell cheaply to' Marchant, hut Myers
could not go wrong.
* * * *
The N.S.W. team to meet S. Australia
and Victoria is practically the slime as the side
which is meeting Bananaland, except that Scanes,
Gostelovv, Trenerry arid Bogle are replaced by Punch,
Wells, Morgan and Love —the last-named because
he combines ’keeping with his hatting. The addi-
tion of Wells, on club form, is an acquisition to the
bowling, and Punch, Morgan and Love will put back-
bone into the batting. Dr. Trenerry would have
strengthened the bowling, and ’keeper Ratcliffe
might easily have replaced his club mate.
The wire announcing that the N.S.W.
members of the touring Australian XI will be avail-
able fbr the inter-State matches caused an audible
sigh of relief in the neighborhood of the S.C.C.
Although there are about 5000 young or middle-
aged men now engaged in reported matches every
week-end there is hardly a hat amongst them.
Week after week the main standbys of the clubs
continue to be former champions such as Austin
Diamond, of Gordon, or veterans who were never top-
notchers at their best. W. W. Chapman, of Mosman,
for instance, though consistently the main scorer for
his side, was not class enough in his day for a place
in an inter-State team.
O’Keeffe, late of N.S.W., showed his quality
as a batsman on Saturday by making 100 not out
for Carlton against Essendon. He batted in great
style without giving a chance, and promises to
capture a place in the State eleven., , With the help
of Stan Hastings (56), his brother Sydney (26 n. 0.)
and Seitz (21) Carlton now stand 2 for 209* Mainly be-
cause of Hartkopf (7 for 56), University amassed
only 129 against N’cote, the top scorer being Bailey
(31). ’Cote replied with 175 for 8, and then closed,
as the match is to finish early next Saturday to
enable the scholars to get away to Adelaide. in
their second try Uni. made 17 without the loss of
a wicket. 'There were four ducks in ’Roy’s 139
against Melbourne, who finished the afternoon with
the meagre response of 5 for 66., Bayliss and Free-
man (43 each) and Richardson (38) were the prin-
cipal contributors to Richmond’s 177. South, the
opposition, are 1 for 4. P’ran scored 174 (Willis
f>3 and Lanipard 44) against Hawthorn East, who
have already lost four good wickets for 45. Mason,
a former junior, made a bright debut for ’Wood by
getting six North wickets for 52, North aggregating
162. ’Wood so far have lost 2 for 33.
All the Popinjays seem able to gallop
early. The three placed horses in a nursery event
at a Sydney suburban meeting a week or two ago
were members of the family, and on Saturday at
Canterbury Park the first and second in a similar
event were Popinjay youngsters. But though the
family has plenty of speed its stamina lias not been
worth talking about. The few adults who have so
far survived gallop confidently up to nearly six
furlongs and then lapse into pessimism. A family
like this might do better if given a chance to
mature.
* * * *
Little Jimmy Munro, who headed the win-
ning jockeys’ list in N. S. Wales last season, is
again in the lead, though still an apprentice. If
James can stand his oats he should .go a long way
in his profession, for nearly every week he gives a
demonstration of the difference between horseman-
ship and mere riding.-At Warwick Farm he captured
a distance race on a sprinter by the old Tod Sloan
device of going 20 lengths ta the front and practising
conservation of energy over the rest of the journey.
It calls for great knowledge of pace. At Canterbury
a few days later his artistry ■in swinging a ■hot-
favorite out of a pocket and capturing the bacon
in the last stride struck the books as a revelation
of juvenile infamy.
The one-time brilliant Biplane was a
runner in the Flying at Canterbury Park on Satur-
day. He looked big and bright, and if able to
stand another gallop or two may win again.
The five-furlong flutters at w.f.a. were
gifts to Gloaming on the two days of the Feilding
(M.L.) Jockey Club’s Spring Meeting. The first, the
Sixteenth- Feilding Stakes, was a canter in front
of Rational (Absurd-Cowl), with the Bezonian geld-
ing Rouen third. In the second, the Oroua Stakes,
he was followed home by the three-year-old Absurd
gelding Tommy Rot', and the two-year-old filly Hula
Girl (Demosthenes-Rangiao), owned by W. F. Desha,
who raced Duo, etc., at Randwick this Spring.
Kemball won the Manchester Handicap with his Tres-
sady gelding Trespass. Gloaming’s recent influenza
has left him thick in the wind, * but it does not
appear to have affected his sprinting abilities. The
times, lmin. 2 l-ssec. and lmin. 1 3-ssee. for the
two races, although they' were won easily, look slow
compared with Machine Gun’s 58sec: on the windy
Riccarton (M.L.) track in 1904, carrying list. 51b.
G-. D. Greenwood, of M.L., is after an
Australasian record in turf-stake winnings. Pluto
recently pushed his aggregate over the £BO,OOO
mark, with a very powerful team working for
him and some big prizes ahead, the stable' expects to
touch £lOO,OOO by Christmas.
* * * *
Remarkable how little attention punters
pay to breeding when sorting winners. On Saturday
at Victoria Park (N.S.W.) .pony meeting. Precious
Dust humped lOst. 41b. and won the Fourteen-two
Handicap. Odds were freely laid on her in a big
field, the scramble being five furlongs. Later in
the day Goldstreak was produced for the big race
(one mile). He won, odds of 25 to I.going begging.
Both mokes are by imported Cesarion from Flying
Gold Dust.
Two starts, two wins is the record of the
Eaton Lad-Bahioo three-vear-old Easingwold since
he returned to Perth. Either the Westralian form
is all to pieces this year or the handsome chestnut
has improved greatly since his failures, in the Spring.
Probably the Second explanation is the true one,
for Bobaris, whom Easingwold beat in the December
Stakes on Saturday with a stone advantage in the
weights, is undoubtedly a good horse —he was equal
favorite with Eurythmic in the latter’s last w.f.a.
race in the West, and put up an excellent fight. At
all events, the meeting of Easingwold and Lionel
Attwill in the W.A. Derby will be interesting.
The chief week-end event in N. S. Wales
golf was the open championship foursomes at Manly.
Oswald-Sealy and Oscar O’Brien, who tied last year
with F. B. Howard and E. J. Pope, were non-
starters on this occasion, Oswald-Sealy being badly
out of practice. However, the Howard-Pope com-
bination tied again, -this time with F. Christie and
L. jR. Dimant, the cards being 79. In the play-off
on Sunday afternoon Howard and Pope did 79
again, their opponents 85. A. Leone and E. B.
Hall also returned a 79; but not having • entered
for the scratch event, had to be content to take the
handicap with a net 74.
Last week the Kangaroos, who were
minus Horder and Caples from the rearguard, Schultz
and-Mick Prentice, the two star supports of Pearce,
and Watkins (replaced by Burge as lock rucker),
walloped a combined Lancastrian XIII by 29 points
(7 tries 4 goals) to 6 points (2 tries). D. Hurcombe,
of Wigan, a member of Wagstaffe’s 1920 Wood-
bines, scored a fine try for the losers. On Saturday
the Aussies went to Barrow, on the west coast (their
longest trip this tour), and licked the Dockers by
24, points (6 tries 3 goals) to 15 points (3 tries
3 goals). The Furness men are a hard side to
down, as may be judged from the fact that they
recently beat Warrington by 24 to 10, after War-
rington had licked the ’Roos by 8 to 5. Joe Dovle,
the centre-threequarter of Wagstaffe’s 1920 touring
side, is the best of their rearguard. Financially the
success of the tour is now assured, and if the gates
of the remaining fixtures maintain the present
average a profit of perhaps £4OOO is in sight.
The finals of the principal singles and
doubles championships in the Melbourne tennis
tournament were too uneven to provide the thrills
that the crowd expected. Patterson and Hawkes,
whose play in the previous rounds suggested that
they would have a stiff fight against Brookes and
O’Hara Wood, decisively beat the formidable pair
in three sets (6 —3. 7 —5, ‘6 —1). • Two thipgs were
responsible—the accuracy of Patterson in his service
ahd ground strokes, and the almost complete collapse
of Brookes at a vital stage. Probably in all his
career the veteran had never played worse tennis.
His volleys seemed to lack their usual sting, and
many of his placements were mere lollies for the
hard-hitting opposition. Wood, who brought off
some beautiful shots in the doubles, was not wily
enough for Patterson in the singles. After a o—20 —2
lead in the first set he dropped the next three, the
second without winning a game. Many of his stylish
strokes had Patterson thinking, but the big fellow
was able to pile up points with-a series of brilliant
service aces. As anticipated, Wood and Mrs. Lister
lifted the mixed doubles with a score of 3 —6, 6— 2,
o—3 against Ilawkes and Miss Addison. The latter
won the ladies’ singles after a hard-fought tussle
with Miss Boyd, who made some good recoveries,
employing a side-line drive with great effect. The
ladies’ doubles went to Misses Boyd and Rendall,
who accounted for Misses Mountain and Bury in
three sets (6 —8, C—3, 6- —3). Of the minor events
the most conspicuous was B. Dunlop’s second succes-
sive triumph in the schoolboys’ championship. He
was superior to M. Lilburne in the final, in which
lie captured two straight sets (G —2, 6—4) without
being seriously bothered.

The Parramatta was dead calm on Satur-
day when the five crews lined up under Ryde bridge

ship. Mosman early took the lead and at half-

Seven Sydney deep-keelers contested the
ninth race for the Rawson Gup last Saturday. Magic
got away well, and had a good lead Before sheets were
inboard at the Manly mark. Oenone and Scotia
had trouble with their gear and retired.' F.B. Lang-
ley’s Ark still led'at Pinchgut, blit on the second turn
down the harbor the larger craft prevailed, and
Albert’s big green flier, with Arthur Marks in
charge, eventually Won with 3mip. 6sec. to spare

Inez . (E. S. Doran) lifted the first race on Port
Jackson for. the ijew 7 d.esign. :21ft.' .restricted class

Gumleaf (R. H. O. Down), E.O.J. (J. L. Milson),
Boomerang (Lex Albert) and Corella (the G.-G.’s
barge) piloted by Don Taylor. Gumleaf was first
away, and chewed the southerly on the leg to Shark
Island, where she eased away with 35sec. to spare
from Corella, and she kept the lead round the Manh
buoy. Inez was a minute away third after the first
leg to windward, when the G.-G.’s rep. carried awav
her headsail. Then the breeze fell, and in the drift-
ing match which ensued Doran’s charge proved too
good by over a minute.
Ex-sculling champion Peter Kemp died at
Summer Hill (N.S.W.) last week, aged 68. He
-succeeded Bill Beach in the title in 1888. and in
less than a year defeated Hanlan, Tom Clifford and
Hanlan again, before losing to Harry Searle. The
latter died just after his defeat of W. O’Connor on
the Thames, and Kemp again became champion. In
April, 1890, he defeated N. Matterson, and in May-
Jack McLean, but he lost to McLean in the following
December, and retired. Right to the end Peter’s
famous shed at Abbotsford was - the rendezvous of
scullers in search of advice.
* * . *. .
On the first day of N.S.W. A. A. A.
Club championships Dug Munro, the S. G. School
all-rounder, was the outstanding figure. In a great
finish in the 120 ; yds. hurdles ' he defeated F. W.
Edwards (holder) in the last few strides in 15 4-ssec.,
which clipped 2-ssec. off the Shield record, and he
won the 161b.shot putt with 37ft. 4fin. from E. A.
Nothlirg (holder). Munro, who has a clean, ease-
style, did 37ft. 4jin., 34ft. 9in. and 34ft. BJin. in
the final putts against Nothling’s 35ft. 9in., 35ft.
2in. and 36ft. 3iin. Uni. is in the lead so
far from East Sydney and Souths.
At Manly on Saturday Charlton, who
is only. 14, cut out 150yds. in lmin. 46 3-ssec.,
which is only 12 3-ssec. outside Cecil Healy’s State
figures for the distance, and is surely a world’s
record for a swimmer of his years. Another 14-
yearwld, Ettie Robertson, did the 50 in 31sec.—or
a bare 4sec. worse than Ethelda Bleibtrey’s world’s
best. Among the seniors Frank Beaurepaire, swim-
ming his first race as a member of East Sydney Club,
did 220yds. in 2min. 30 l-ssep. It was the fastest
furlong record in a Sydney club event for over
eight years.

J°e Cook was farewelled by a throng of
100 m the Queen’s Hall of Federal Parlia-
ment House. The proceedings were formal
a « i e but when the large dinner was
safely stowed away dignity was banished
and the crowd roared choruses like kids at
a school treat. D. S. Jackson, from Tas-
mania, began the community singing by re-
questing vocal support for yards of doggerel
picturing the virtues of the blushing guest
and, when he got the choir active, ex-M.H.R.
Orchard kept it working on a string of
hurdy-gurdy airs. One of the items of the
evening “Pretty Redwing,” whistled
by Defence Minister Hyrie, and the beautiful
tone of his solo was put down to heavy
practice lately in whistling for more funds.
Joe Cook, who received the finest tribute
from a brother miner, Matthew Charlton'
looked like a jeweller’s window when he had
collected all his gifts. A gold, cigarette-case
gold match-box and chain glittered beside a
silver candelabra arrangement nresented to
his wife. By the way, they are taking onlv
half-a-dozen small Cooks to London. The
rest of the virile tribe will be left in Aus-
tralia.
When Governor Weigall, who can’t stand
the financial strain any longer, retires in
April, Premier Barwell will lose one of his
greatest admirers. According to political
gossip in Melbourne Weigall has figured out
for his chief adviser a soaring career which is
to include the Prime Ministership and decora-
tions fore and aft.
Melba confesses to having been touched to
a great tenderness by the compliment paid
her by The People over her series of ss. con-
certs.; The box-plan was billed to open at
Allans at 7.30 in the morning. Applicants
for tickets began to arrive at davbreak, and
long before the advertised hour they had made
themselves into what the descriptive reporter
calls a surging crowd. A man came out to
distribute coupons, but he was mobbed and
nearly had his life crushed out against the
doofs of a bank on the opposite side of Col-
lins-street. He lost his coat in the struggle
and when he was at his last gasp he despair-
ingly flung all his remaining coupons into the
thick of the riot. That saved him, but
nearly killed dozens of others. Eighteen
women, after waiting patiently for hours,
fainted at the crucial moment of surge, and
so lost their chance. Popularity could go no
farther than this crowd expressed it. And
the crowd wasn’t made up of only city folk ;
scores of country people as well as suburban-
ites caught first trains to town to battle for
tickets.
For the second concert the box-oflice opened
at the mystic hour of midnight, and Allan’s
windows had been boarded up against eventu-
alities. By 7 a.m. every seat was bought
and paid for; the fagged night-duty staff
broke for bed, and the remains of the crowd
went home to fry their breakfast eggs in the
fat of disappointment. Some of them are now
wondering if it wouldn’t have been simpler
to have opened the box-office at 6 p.m. and
let the rush happen on the right side of
midnight instead of in the dreary and tram-
less wee sma’ ’ours.
A cate chantant at the Oriental brought
in a mighty cheque for the Homoeopathic
Hospital. Lady Stradbroke sat at the tea-
table of honor and watched the show from
under a big black hat. There was a fine
programme, and, after she had done her turn,
Ella Shields, in her trim boyish turnout as
Burlington Bertie, was led along to be pre-
sented to the Countess. The lounges, dining-
room and winter garden were swamped by
the Best Dressed. Sassiety shows its tem-
per at these crushes and one discovers the
real who give most and don’t
mind a back seat, in contrast to the aggres-
sive dames who pay ss. for tea and toast and
a chair and demand their money’s worth in
forcible tones. The waiters and maids —who
do much of the work for sweet charity—have
a lively time under the tongue-lashing, and
why they don’t all end up as Bolsheviks is
one of the eternal mysteries.
Teddy Cahill and George Brooke, who
have a mighty social following, were given
their complimentary concert in the Assem-
bly Hall on December 2. All the seats —
even unto the gallery—were reserved at top
price by the Naicest. The Countess sat close
to the platform and at encore-time bent over
to ask Brooke to sing “Mary of Argyle.” She
was a graceful presence in a soft black gown
with pearls around her neck. Lady Helena
Rous, with her, wore vivid pink under an
ermine coat. Mrs. Noel Boothby, who had
helped to engineer the show, was in the
padded seats of the mighty, along with Mrs.
Han Taylor and Miss Bagot. Somebody
gave the Countess a bunch ot lavender and
the A. E. V. Richardson baby passed her a
handful of pansies. Mrs. Richardson gave
an informal supper party after the show in
a grove of decorative palms. The Countess,
while waiting to be called for by his Ex. at
the finish, held up the exit of the Most Polite.
She filled i n time with the artists whom she
has taken very snugly under her wing.
Last Saturday Stonington spread its green
lawns, its vice-regal verandahs and terraces
and even its back paddocks with cretowne
paper flowers and all the gimcfhcks belong-
ing to fgtes. The Nobility and Quality of
loorak and a huge field of triers-for-a-place
swarmed about the sacred grounds, and
bought and sold the usual bazaar goods in
the name of the city newsboy and his patron
saint, Miss Onions. Heralded by committee-
man R. W. Knox, Stonington s own wil-
lowy Countess did the opening rites from
the edge of the front terrace with a body-
guard of committee people, around her. She
was in delicious loose drapings of putty charm-
euse, extending from shoe-ties to ears, and
finishing off there and at the wrists in fur
edgings. Above the classic creation—which
m cut -and lines is a summer replica of a
graceful velour that encased her at several
famous “openings” in the winter—drooped
a picture-hat of tobacco-brown carrying its
load of gold and brown feathering. Buried
among masses of blooms, Mrs. R. S. Whit-
ing (in gold-and-green cretonne and silken
jumper) and * Miss Henty (in flowery cre-
tonne) ran a busy flower-stall, and the Best
dame and Camberwell’s Mayoress (Mrs. Bel-
maine) had a desperate time of it serving
a clamoring mob with their home-made
cakes. The most novel stall was the
hat shop, with a separate tent for trying-on,
with Mrs. Jas. Dyer (in dove grey georgett-
mgs), and Mrs. Norman Brookes as milli-
ners-in-chief. The drawing-room was a
concert-hall, and a real Chinese band dressed
m every-colored silk let itself go in the open
an-. And among and around, beneath and
Within everything, was the Girl with the
Raffle-book, impossible to dodge, impossible
to satisfy, ravenous for bobs and half-crowns.
Our Earl is luring State members over
to lunch in batches. He takes care to
have a sprinkling of each party every -time,
and the guests manage to get back to town
inside two hours from the time they start
by State motor or tram (it’s a free ride
either way). All are agreed that as host
and hostess their Exes, are quite up to the
standard they read about in novels which
tell of the charming hospitality of the “real
nobility.”
Mary Mack, the handsome young Austra-
lian photoed here by Yandyck, has a con-
tralto which some judges declare is likely to
prove one of the best
that Victoria has put
forward. She has
studied under Sobell
at the ’Varsity Con.,
and has won honors
at her triumphal
exams. Mary is the
youngest of the brood
of squatter Joseph
Mack, of Berrybank,
in the Western Dis-
trict. She and
Rieke Parker re-
cently gave a recital
in Melbourne, and
showed their paces
with great success.
The young songstress
will probably fly
abroad later for more
study. At ' present she is lapping up the
tuition available in Melbourne, which, of
course, is'considerable.
fetter a while ago mentioned that there
are 800 limbless soldiers. That is Victoria’s
tally. In the Commonwealth there are 3000
Diggers who have lost an arm or a leg or
inore than one. The Limbless Soldiers’ Asso-
ciation of Vic., : with Henry Clucas as sec-
retary, is tackling the job of looking after
the special interests of these maimed Bill-
jims. It is trying, among other things, to
secure them employment in congenial indus-
tries, to encourage ambition, self-confidence
and self-help, to alleviate distress from acci-
dent, sickness, etc., and to provide for all
men who have lost two limbs a house, rent-
free for life. The Association is backed up
by a welfare committee which includes Mal-
colm Brodie, Cornish (Australian Club),
Cornie (Australian Paper Mills), Mrs. Mac-
Pherson, Mrs. Rattigan, Mrs. Stein and Miss
Pennefather. it is an active organisation,
independent and careful of its pennies, and
is worth helping if only because of its desire
to help itself. It has 460 men on its books
and HO or 60 of them are still unemployed,
so there is room for a little practical assist-
ance if you care to give it.

Mrs. (Ivy Deakin) Brookes is taking a
vivid interest in the Chautauqua. She en-
tertained the leading members of the party
at her house in South Yarra, and the neigh-
bors came in to hear all about it. Private
teat, a Canadian soldier who has written
war-books and lectured much, gave a talk
about Chautauqua. He began by explaining
tnat all the entertainers were not like him
—he was the smallest and leanest. A won-
dering audience, got the idea that Chautauqua
must be a cannibal feast. Another Canadian
who spoke gave a touching picture of “little
Henry of the Never Never” who was shut
out from all learning and was left to “black-
tel lows corroborees and the shrieking of
b P.6 cockatoos.” The audience politely
stifled its grins. But it was an effort,
lhmk of poor, wistful “Little Henry” sit-
ting. on a fence amid the. dust raised by
jazzing Bmghis waiting to be saved by
Chautauqua !
The endurance, patience and sporting
courage of Kathleen Braithwaite, the only
girl-competitor on the Thousand-mile Motor
Trial, astonished all the big, brave men.
fehe even kept on looking amiable when, with
a good chance of getting placed among the
hrst three, and. after coming through the
roughest mountain bits with scarcely a loose
nut, her car suffered four hours’ worth of dam-
age on the smooth road near Lilydale. She
kept on smiling right up to the dizzy old
end; but a snapping-point came. It was
when the Test was finished and done with
and the cars were lining up. An official
came along just when she was comfy and
told her to move on a few yards. Kathleen
moved, but as she did so from her rosy lips
slipped her first good, round, satisfying
Blow!” —or some golf equivalent.
Of £52,C00 promised to the Uni., as the
result of last year's appeal, £48,000 has been
paid. Premier uawson made it a condition
that there should be an appeal to the pubi .
for help when he undertook to find £200,000
(loan money) for additional buildings. The
arts school is now well on its way, and a
big contract has been let for the school of
anatomy. The "shop” will be something'to
be less ashamed of in a year or two after the
Reform Bill is passed and the State subsidy
has been enlarged.
Mrs. Vogrich, who coaches the musical
talent of the Catholic Ladies’ College girls,
gave a concert in the Playhouse a few nights
ago, to show off the paces of her charges.
And they did it with admirable effect.
The Western District is echoing with jazz.
The Pattersons, of Warrock station, at
Casterton, gave a big ball the other night.
The district motored in full force, and found
the garden hung with Chinese lanterns, the
ballroom glowing with delphinium-blue and
gold and Mrs. Crow’s local band crashing
out the most jazziferous sounds. The Arthur
Corneys from Tulse Hill, the Shaws from
Rifle Downs, the Youngs from Retreat, and
the Custs from the Gables were among the
party-frocked crowd. Mrs. Hidgcock, from
N.S.W., went along with her newly-wed
daughter, and the Hugh Pattersons trekked
in from Capaul. The dance went on till
daylight, and supper was an all-night lure
in the conservatories.
Isidore Ivozminsky is back from America,
deeply impressed by the evidence of dollars-
to-burn which he found among Yanks of
the jewel-buying order. Australian opals
are going to fetch good prices out yonder,
says Isidore, and tourmalines, peridots and
aquamarines will not go begging. With the
country crazy about jewels the expert from
Melbourne saw reason to expect a good sale
for his book on ‘'The Magic and Science of
Jewels and Stones,” which will be published
by Putnams in January, For 12 years he
has been at work on this book, and now he
seems to have struck the right time for get-
ting it on the market.
Gordon Carter, who is that rare bird a
Parliamentary agent, by grace of a special
certificate from the State Government, dis-
covered further evidence of his popularity in
a dinner given to him by several of Premier
Lawson’s followers at Parliament House the
other night. The food was soread in a room
made available by President Manifold, and
the embarrassed guest heard nearly two
hours’ talk about his nublic and private vir-
tues. O. R. Snowball, A. A. Farthing and
Greenwood were particularly warm on his
past services as sec. of the Public Service
Federation, which, since his resignation, has
broken up into a number of weak and con-
tentious fragments.
C. J. - Barrow has thrown up his job as
Grand Sec. of the State’s Freemasons, and his
assistant, Will Stewart, succeeds him. There
will be a new Grand Master as well as a new
sec. soon. Earl Stradbroke will be formally
elected this month, and installed in March in
succession to F. T. Ilickford, whose last lituc
bit of limelight will thereupon peter out.
Mrs. Sarah Macgregor, who lingered many
years after her husband —he was Assembly
member for South Melbourne in the late
’7o’s and early ’Bo’s —went into the valley a
few days ago. She spent her last days at
Geelong West, and was heading for 87 when
the summons came.
Adelaide drops a line:-
The other night a gentleman in the front row of
the dress-circle at the Theatre Royal, who had re-
moved his collar and tie prior to entering, further
cooled himself by shedding his coat and vest. As
he still looked uncomfortable the ushers became ner-
vous, and one of them told him to re-dress. He is
now regarded ,as a sort of Christian martyr by a
section of the public, who are flooding the dailies
with letters asking why men can’t sit in a theatre
in their shirt-sleeves if women are allowed to show
their—well, you know what they show.
Cecil F. O’Halloran AVright passed out a few days
ago as a result of a large block of stone falling on
his head and fracturing his skull. His life had been
marked by an extraordinary series of narrow escapes
from death, and most of his bones had been frac-
tured at one time and another. As a young man
he was in the Bank of N. S. Wales, but prior to
enlisting in the Fritz-hunt he resided in S’Africa.
Lady Weigall opened the playground given by
J. M. Reid and his wife to the citizens of Hind-
marsh. Originally a neglected piece of ground on the
Port-road reserve, it is now a most up-to-date kid-
dies’ recreation park. It was her Ex.’s idea that the
youngsters should have it, and she roughed out the
design, which was perfected by young architect Klay
Kaines. The adjoining block, laid out as a garden
with a fine bandstand, was also “opened.”
The Adelaide Hunt Club this year struck out on
a new line and held two race meetings in
the one season. The weather was wintry
enough for fur coats —one woman’s hat was blown
clean over the stand—but the attendance was good.
Cheltenham was the chosen course, and the com-
mittee officially lunched the vice-regals and repre-
sentatives of other clubs.
The other afternoon the retiring Mayoress enter-
tained about 1000 women at the Town Hall. For
the most part they represented those whose names
on the Mayoral visitors’ book had been pathetic
offerings to Hope during the past two years. But
they got their chance in the final event, and they
made the most of it. Members of the Humphrey
Bishop Comedy Co. made satisfying music; but a
more material satisfaction was the objective of the
majority. They made a beeline for the banqueting-
room, and the congested mass 0 f women that fell
upon the waitresses when the doors were opened
suggested a Russian famine.
Charles J. Mellor, who was connected with the
Rank of Adelaide for over 50 years, passed out
at St. Peter’s the other day, 14 months after his
retirement. He was once a prominent cricketer, and
for a long time held the record for high-jumping. A
widower for the past four years, he has a son in
W.A. and a married daughter, Mrs. Guy Stanton, in
England.
The League of Loyal Women is making a big
appeal to the city people to give toys for the
kiddies on the Murray River settlements, whose
parents, living under primitive conditions, haven't
much chance of doing anything for them in that line.
Frank Hayward has placed a shop in Hayward
Buildings at the disposal of the League for a week
as a receiving dep&t.
A very influential committee, including most of
the Ministers, has adopted a former suggestion to
annex the back garden of Government House as a
site for a war memorial. This space, at the top of
a steep bank running down to the Parade Ground
and the river, should make a splendid site. The
City Council and Government are driving a bargain
at the same time for widening the already broad
King AVilliam-road that runs alongside.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Holeporof
Hostery
The late W. B. Dailey used to swear to
this. When he and Parkes toured the
United Kingdom together explaining what
an excellent place N. S. Wales was, they
usually called themselves “agents”—“immi-
gration agents.” They arrived in Galway
when the Marquis of Clanricarde (whose
family seat, Portumna Castle, now belongs
to Princess Mary’s future husband) was at
the height of his unpopularity. A couple of
attempts had been made on his life by evicted
tenants, though he rarely gave the peasantry
a chance to see him. He lived in London
except when it was necessary for him to
cross the Irish Channel on business. Parkes
and Dailey arrived at Portumna simultane-
ously with a rumor that the hated rack-
renter was in the district. It was evening,
and they were being rowed across a lonely
lake. In the middle of the vast expanse of
inky water the boatman was seen to remove
the plug' jn the bow of the craft and make
preparations for going overboard. “Good
God, man,” cried Dailey, “what are you
doing that for?” “Let agents drown!” re-
plied the man darkly. “But it’s not you
we’re after, ye little blagyard, but him”—
pointing to Parkes, who was dozing, worn
out with the day’s exertions. “What’s he
done?” asked Dailey. “To Hell wid Clan-
ricarde ! And to Hell wid his bloody-minded
agents!” “You think he’s the Marquis?”
The man nodded. “Henry, wake up, for
God’s sake,” said Dailey. “You’re being
mistaken for the Marquis of Clanricarde.”
“Hi ham not ha Marquis,” said Parkes. “Oi
belave you,” said the boatman, who had not
previously heard him speak, and immediately
replaced the plug. “It was the one and
only time in my career as a defender,” Dai-
ley used to say, “that I have known two
useful lives to be saved by a handful of
aspirates.”
Returned to Sydney last week, J. D. and
Mrs. Fitzgerald. The ex-Minister for
Health is slowly recovering from the illness
which had him in its grip all during his visit
to London. On the voyage back to Sydney
he regained some of his lost flesh, and is
now hurrying to wrap a few more pounds
about the form which was never over-bur-
dened with gross matter. Mrs. Fitzgerald,
who left Sydney 10 years ago with singing
daughter Ara, has alternated between Paris
and Milan, the whole of the time being
pressed into the making of a prima donna.
Daughter Ara is that now, in addition to
being Mrs. John Clarke and the mother of
the future opera-star of the world. Singing-
masters Bouhey, Borghi, old Sydney friend
Belle Sorel and the inimitable Colli have
left their hallmark on the beautiful lyric
voice, .which expects to breathe o’er Aus-
tralia next year.
The way of the singing student is not
strewn with truffles and rose-petals. For
all the 10 years Ara’s luncheon was invari-
ably a small piece of underdone steak and a
milk-pudding consumed four hours before the
lesson. No fruit or vegetables must be eaten
before this great rite. After the lesson, a
rest; then the evening meal; and 10 o’clock
brought the bedroom candles.
The Fitzgeralds report Chryssa Crichton-
Imrie to be doing well as the St. John of
the Australian tinned-fruit trade. She
perches on the fourth floor of “The Crich-
ton,” in view of the Tube, around the
corner from Piccadilly Circus and in the
heart of London clubland. The basement of
this bit of Australia is a ballroom, the next
floor is a restaurant, the next two floors are
clubrooms, where all the Australian and
Maoriland papers can be found—and often
an Australian or Maoriland poet or proser
as well.
The end-of-season reduction in the Butt-
Ruinford concert-prices resulted in a Town
Hall so tightly packed that by comparison
sardines in a tin enjoy spacious quarters.
The front row of chairs was so close to the
stage that the tall ones could have rested
their chins on it, and the shins of all were
barked on the seats in front —it was a bad
night for the six-footers. Flowers had been
twisted and twined into all manner of shapes
to draw the short gasp of wonder from the
song-bird—a lantern, which she carried off
over her shoulder; a stole of flowers, which
she drew gaily about her; an aeroplane, which
they led gently but firmly into the aero-
drome, Clara at the nose, Kennerley at the
tail. Another admirer handed up a poppy-
wreathed hat. It was a great night on
which the Keys of Heaven finally rattled.
The female head of the Lucas-Tooths is,
with a daughter, re-visiting Sydney. The
lady is the widow of her cousin, the first
baronet; her three sons fell in the war.
Marjorie Mackay, of Boree, Walcha, made
the time-honored promises to Lieut.-Com-
mander Denis Q. Pildes at St. James’s the
other afternoon in the presence of Padre
Micklem. A pretty cream walking-dress
with embroidered and beiringed panels, a
black lace hat, and the old-fashioned ivory-
backed Prayer-book completed the bridal
outfit; while sister Enid carried out the
bridesmaid’s functions in a dress that looked
like a bit of the noonday sky over Middle
Harbor. Bridegroom s father is Sir Duke
Fildes, 11. A., of London, the artist who
painted the State portraits of the last two
Kings and of Queen Alexandra—and can
you realise that she was 77 one day last
week V
Holy Trinity Church, Orange, staged a
pretty wedding last week when lva Bromley
became Mrs. George Bruce, of Loombah,
Cumnock. The wedded ones come from two
of Orange’s oldest and most hospitable
families, so there was an overflow audience
in the church, which, incidentally, was
almost literally blanketed in white roses.
White jet and tulle over shell-pink satin
clothed the small blonde bride; the three
bridesmaids were white and gold. The wed-
ding feast' was spread in the Oddfellows’
Hall, transformed by red japonica and blue
drapings into a stagelike Oriental scene.
Another cheque was reaped at the Went-
worth for St. Luke’s last week. This time
the gleaners were the Cremorne Branch of
St. Luke’s Committee—Mrs. Bryant, secre-
tary, and Mrs. Pratt, treasurer, both cloaking
their nefarious designs in black satin. Frank
Lamb, who secretaries St. Luke’ft, shed light
on the party; his wife wore jade*"bindings on
an otherwise sombre outfit; graceful Modi.
Willoughby danced ail through th>' night:
and Dorothy Sweet and Mr. Glennib Spun
round like the tail of ah aeroplane, ahd
worked an intricate crochet design with their
feet and legs which made even the Wentworth
spotlight swoon with amakemeht. tip in
the gallery, after her concert, Clara Butt
consumed oysters in a contemplative fashion,
supported by violinist MelSa and hbr hus-
band.
The Tivoli Follies of 1921 —they’re nearly
a year older now—fluttered into the Winter
Garden one afternoon last week between
matinee and night turn, and bloomed around
a long table hostessed by good-looking Nellie
Vaughan, whose nose is as straight' hs the
Papal succession. Nellie, who k very soft-
voiced, had crooned a plume ol- two from
an ostrich friend, and after twisting them
into a head covering had a length over to
coquette with her left shoulder. A cloak of
soft cream lace covered a dress as faintly
pink as a maiden’s cheek when she can
afford the very expensive variety of blush.
Little Mrs. Hector St. Clair was assistant
hostess, and the newly-returned Mrs. Hugh
D. Mclntosh one of the guests.
Soldiers’ friend Mrs. Sargent held a
bazaar of her very own at the firm’s George-
street rooms last week in aid of her pet
Warriors’ Day Fund. The stalls were
stocked by Mrs. Sargent, and manned by
pretty girls and small children, among
whom the three diminutive Sargents made
a valiant attempt to follow in generous Mrs,
George’s energetic footsteps. It was a
cheery little function, and some ex-Dig-
gers’ wives are going to be the happier for it.
Clara Butt says this is the contralto of
the world, and after you have heard the
’cello-like speaking voice of Clarice Coles (to
be known to her audiences as Coleson) you
feel that the Dame
has picked a winner.
Clarice is a tall, slim
girl, whose hair holds
red-gold tones, and
she has the clear
complexion that ac-
companies such a top-
knot. Her only
teacher has been A.
R. Richards, o f
Randwick, who was
a pupil of the elder
Garcia, and in his
day leading tenor of
St. George’s Chapel,
London, and a mem-
ber of Queen Vic-
toria’s choir at Buck-
ingham Palace. Dame
Clara and Kennerley
Rumford think she should go to Europe
almost immediately, and have pledged them-
selves to do all they can for her. The
Dame has opened a subscription list, a strong
committee is being formed to make plans
for the contralto’s future, and Hugh Deni-
son has put his name down for a round
figure. Clarice’s father has been connected
with the Sun and its predecessor, the Star,
for 34 years.

Thosd clevbr ttainbrs of kiddies, Monica
and I rahbes Sehily, produced a charming
entertainiheht at the Palace last week in aid
of the Crown-strebt Women’s Hospital. A
Yule-tide reVu'e was the name given to the
nutter, which rested entirely on the clever
feet Of (dainty Sweets and pro-
grahiines wer'e sold by human Christmas
bells.
Newcastle put on its best bib and tucker
and boated to Walsh Island, where Mrs. A. E.
Cutler, the lady whom Lord Jellicoe described
as "the most important resident of the coal
city,” was holding out both hands for linen
gifts with which to furnish the Newcastle
Girls’ Hostel. Dame Margaret was the
guest of honor, and she gave a sparkling little
address on the uses of girls’ hostels. The
fine result of the afternoon in linen and cash
is assessed at £125. Trays of sustenance
were handed round by amateur waitresses,
and it seemed a pity that so much fresh young
beauty was wasted on about 300 mere females.
Bertha Swallow was the star in a charming
musical programme. She shortly follows the
other Newcastle girl, Bryl Walldey, now of
a J.C.W. co., to the Conservatorium. Bertha
is a born applause-getter, for she is as de-
lightful to listen to as she is to look at.
To-day (Thursday), from three of the
afternoon, to ten-thirty at night, the cafb-
chantant in aid of Europe’s starving children
will continue in the new Mockbell rooms,
next to the Theatre Royal.
In typical Australian sunshine the Bar-
nardo boys were given their first glimpse
of country life, when, at the invitation of
Mr. F. H. Stoddard, they visited his Palm-
ville estate at Ourimbah. The orange
orchard with its bountiful golden crop
proved the greatest attraction to the youth-
ful immigrants, and they went back to
Scarborough at the end of a pleasant day
with more than full hearts.
Little poetess Ivy Gibbs is spending a holi-
day in a farmhouse on the Nepean. She
describes it as sprawling over the brow of
a hill sentinelled by great, kindly trees: and
perfumed by the old-fashioned garden in
which Ivy sees many a fairy born every sun-
set. The head of the grown-up family was
brought to this pleasant hdme as a bride and
has never spent a night away from her own
roof since.
There was enough talent to float a State
Orchestra and a Grand Opera Company in one
corner of the Australia last Saturday morn-
ing when Mrs. Freddie Shipman dispensed
cool drinks and warm hospitality to a sec-
tion of young Australia which either
possessed a voice or music-raising qualities of
sky-scraper altitude. Freddie pretended he
liked being the man of the hour, and dressed
the part of toast-passer and drink-mixer in'
neat pepper-and-salt tailorings. Adelina
Leon, Melbourne’s ’cellist, and soprano Jean
Drummond looked as cool and inviting as
pink-and-white ice-creams; and a Kirk-
patrick girl enhanced natural good looks with
well-assembled dress parts, and seemed to
bring with liter , the call oil the sprf. to tool
the somtewhat tdrria Wihtter Garden.
Mis. Jdhn Batlcw, fts president of the
Cathollte Wcimteh’s Association, is strtetching
a wing over the poor of Darlinghurst, and
makes on their behalf an appeal for gro-

substituted for the usual Christmas dinner.
Pretfy Helen Barlow, by the way, is put"
ting the knowledge of massage she gained
during the war to practical purpose, and
is assistant to ex-War Sister Kellahar, whose
beauty rooms in the renovated Australia
boast two framed addresses, one signed by
the President of France, the other by the
French Minister of War, both in recogni-
tion of services on the Western Front.

.Besides playing one afternoon to a mob-
ster gathering of Queen Victoria Club-
Wbmen, MaUd Fitz-Stubbs’s fingers waltzed
gaily over the piano at a Paling recital.
Listening to the composer of the old-time
“Heather” ahd “Orlando,” there were some
middle-aged men and women who remem-
bered hearts that broke to the three-quarter
time of De Groen’s band when the best girl
or boy billowed and swirled too often with
another. The hearts are now none the worse
for it; which is why the memories that
Maud Fitz-Stubbs’s playing recalls are
laughter-edged.
Dr. George Heydon, who as a Major in the
Army Medical Corps won an M.C., leaves
this week for Rabaul to establish a labora-
tory for the Commonwealth Government, and
to direct a hookworm campaign. Dr. George
is a son of the lately-retired Judge of the
Arbitration Court.
A Sydney widow has a silken shawl of
value and antiquity for which she claims
mystic love power. It was given to her
mother as a girl by her future husband,
who had just returned from India, on the night
when he proposed. The present owner wore
it over her snoulders the night in the garden
When her own husband proposed; and she
passed it to her daughters, with entire success,
oh occasions when she decided that it was time
that certain philandering young gentlemen
should declare their intentions. Some time
ago she lent it to a friend whose daughter
was showing an inclination to linger on the
shelf; and that girl is now engaged. It wfts
that dear friend who told the story of the
magic shawl. She added that its owner’s
husband has been dead nearly a year, and
she notices that the widdy is wearing it
herself now.
One carriageful of North Shore liners
grinned behind its newspaper the other
morning. A Digger with a flower farm
and a very English up-stage accent boarded
a first-class as the train was moving out.
He thrust his dress baskets of blooms under
a seat, languidly removed the sweat from
his brow, and at the invitation of a neighbor
dropped into a seat for a smoke and a yarn.
Sitting opposite the petal-pedlar was the
Nabob of. the village somewhat obtrusively
absorbed in a book of French poems. “Ah,”
said he, catching the Digger’s eye fixed on
the title, “you seem interested. Would you
care to read a page or two?” He smiled
broadly as Bilijim reached out a hand; but
instead of the quick return the carriage
looked for, the Digger was absorbed in the
pages till the train was running into Mil-
son’s Point. Then he handed the book back
to its ovyner with a languid: “Always fas-
cinating, Gautier; but that is really a poor
selection. I will show you some much finer
examples of his work if you care to drop
into my camp some night.” It was the
Man of Culture’s turn to mop his brow.
Cecil Bostock, a favorite of the London
Salon, has just closed an interesting and
away'-up-amid-the-Arts exhibition of photo-'
graphy in Sydney. It is impossible to de-
scribe the delicate treatment of light and
shade, the texture, and the movement in
these camera-paintings. Perhaps the best
examples of all the combined qualities on the
walls of the Kodak salon were “Still Life”
and “La Lune.”

complete for Nawng Pet Tin, Ltd., I am
prepared for a limited period to report as to
the suitability of other properties in Siam
and F.M.S. for treatment by my method.
Following the success (which I take for
granted) of the Nawng Pet proposition, im-
possible undertakings will probably be on
the market. The investor being assured,
apart from values, that the several factors
—water-power, dump for tailings, suitability
of ground. for treatment, etc., are all pre-
sent, will avoid expense, to say the least, by
proceeding under the advice of the inventor
who knows the requirements under any given

Harry F.: But no school would give you
the ideas ; and they’re the goods that are in demand.
....D. Domum: No new thought in it... .L.R.F.:
One is very good; the others so-50... .Edwin W.:
Tame little yarn.... Alice A.: “The Bushman’s Fatal
Dream” is an adaptation to timber-getting of a well-
known ballad, but handled in a very rough way....
Sadie U.: Not for us... .A.H.L.; Avery small
thought in verse that needs sandpapering Sierra:
Doesn’t make a sketch; but Decency might report
Piety for some of its uncleanliness... .E.L.S.: Too
slight R.F.G.: All miss John A.: The verse
is thin and feeble... .L.A. (Kilmore) : They couldn’t
be much worse C.B. (Moonbi) : Such stuff as
dreams are made of B.P. J.: Terrible D.D.D.:
Try for more humor Berenice: Not nearly
F. :No use to us M.R.8.: Even a skit should
bear some resemblance to the real thing Louise
TANARUS.: The verse is so rough we had to read it with
a stump-jump plough C.P.Q.C.: Some good lines,
but also some very lumpy ones Franagher: Hardly
enough in the doll Ploda Long: “Ashes” has good
stuff in it. Put some more elbow-grease into it and
get rid of a lot of the commonplaces... .John W.:
Far too rough Sylvia W.: They all have ideas
and they all fall down. Why try to make a verb
like “disturb” into a noun? W.M.8.: An old
'theme handled in the old way.... Os. TANARUS.: Well
written, but the yarn is far too small and thin for
all those words... .H.J.M.: No; you’re not “a ray
of light,” but there is a glimmer in your stuff....
8.C.P.: Run the plane over it L.H.R.R.: Don’t
like it... .A.M.H.: “Giving Up” doesn’t strike us...
S.J.L.: None of them get near K.G. (Kimbolton) :
Verse too bumpy J.G. (New' Farm): They all
miss E.M.F.: “Friendship” uses the old com-
monplaces; “Billy” is a theme w'orked to death....
Also Ran: “The Islands” got pretty close. .Marr R.:
Nice color in the verse, but so little else Rose A.:
Promising Lynden R.: You employ a whole sea to
drive home a lesson that one pot of beer w T ould have
taught better J.K.M.: “Whirligig” drags
W.C.K.: The “Night” sonnet doesn’t really say
anything; and we don’t like your “Paradise”
H.R.M.: The capture of the burglar is too mechani-
cal. .. .F.S.G.: Yarn doesn’t convince C.H.S.:
They don t strike us. . .En Zed: Not enough in them.
. ...C.P.H.: The splendid closing stanza deserves
glory:—
Now' what, Damned Bell, hast thou
, Of right, or Powers That Be,
To shoo me from the shining bar,
And treat to sodas She?
N.A.E.: Punctuation is part of the writing. Its
absence is proof of a lazy desire to put your work
on other people’s shoulders.... Macnoon: Goes
brightly, but doesn’t say much.... Ethel W.: The
first line tells the whole tale. . . .C.C. (Auckland):
Sorry, no use. .. .Dindi: Nothing in “Shocky”....
W.G.C.: That sort of thing has been done to death.
... .Marjorie C.: Get a story to write. We believe you
could make a pretty good shot at writing it....
A.G.F.: “The Job” goes wobbling on, but doesn’t
get to any real story G.P.M.: Not ours Alex.
G. : No use Henry I.: Not up M.R.8.: Can’t
get the yarn... .T.8.D.: Yes, there’s inspiration
about the address to your w'ife: —
Dear, you may be dreadfully shocked,
But I must write of others frocked
Down here ; it’s low-necks and short skirts ;
I’m afraid they are little flirts.
There’s one sweet thing quite full of tricks,
And she’s just about twenty-six ;
Some day we’re going for a dip
In the waves letting other things rip.
Oh, now’, 3'ou musn’t get jealous,
Or think me unduly zealous,
We just w'on’t dress in the same sheds,
And sleep in quite different beds.
She’s an artist. Ia poet,
And to the world we will sho\y it;
We’ll take walks on the shelly beach,
And arm in arm each other teach.
The moon will be so very bright,
And all the stars give out their light;
’Twill he lovely to gaze on Mars,
And think of all the wohdrous pars.
.... Sherry: More like methylated spirits
J.W.M.: Don’t like them.... Horton B.: The “Crea-
tures” do not make a yarn Q.E.D.M.: Very lame.
. ...E.W.L.: Not up to requirements... .M.J.8.:
“The Altruist” not for this market... .D.R.C.: Far
too long for its interest. .. .R.S.Y.S.: One held for
another reading T.0.P.: Send it to the girl. If
she can stand it, no smaller evil is ever likely to dis-
turb your domestic bliss J. 11.5.: The “Hut” is
not improved sufficiently... .J.J.H.: Judging by this
sample your most “prominent faults” are (1) lack
of a story to tell, and (2) lack of ability to tell it.
....Walter J.: Can you put the kava yarn into a
par ‘t.... Robert F.: Thanks’; but no use to u 5....
Beryl: Too rugged.... Dotte D.: A wearisome lot of
words about nothing much E.W.L.: Not well
enough worked out Tarwoona: You don’t make
the yarn of it that the idea is capable 0f... .E.R.D.:
Very bad verse... .8.P.W.: As futile as a curate’s
simper.... Kat: “Why?” deserves a place:—
Truth in its whiteness, why
Do they shun like lepers?
Why is pure truth carted aside,
While ignorance stalks among the sleepers ?
Who keeps truth chained from wandering wide?
Skilful engineers do it. Why ?
Because engineers can manipulate ignorance
For their benefit; for that ’tis worth while
To lead seekers for truth a dance
And away from light. With hearts vile
And tongues all coated with lie,
They’ll do it, for all they’re worth, till they die.
... .8.A.W.: The reply ought to go to the paper that
printed the taradiddles... .W.O.Ci: All old ground.
....Pheasant: Nothing in it to keep a sleepy man
awake; and this is heavy weather.... V. 5.8.: Sym-
pathise with you. It must have hurt.... W.H.S.: Not
up to standard.... Nero: Been said before....
A.D.M.: Too long for its interest... .Lismore: Least
said about his banking experience the better. He
had only just enough to show him that there wasn’t
much money in keeping other men’s accounts....
H. J.T.: Both miss.—S.W.G.H.: Dog yarn 01d....
Pituri: That would side-track the original discus-
sion. .. .K.0.1v.: Splodgy effort in blunt red pencil
too much for us... .Hannibal: Matter already dis-
cussed in Abo. column... .Bilmac: Both old.
TO AUTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.B.: In the infants’ class K.V.F.: Your draw-
ing doesn’t improve Cog: Shocking drawing;
silly joke Jas. W. S'.: Confused little effort....
John W. S. and G.II.: Will do as suggestions
J.M.C.: Ineffective scratching^.... Jo: An emphatic
No A.E.: Feeble A.S.P.: Joke not worth the
drawing, and the drawing’s not worth much....
H.S.K.: All miss.

Christmas fun
with an Amberola
Nothing can add so much enjoyment to
Christmas season as an Edison Amberola —
especially if you have a Recording Outfit.
This inexpensive device enables you and your friends to record
their voices and reproduce them at will at any subsequent
time—the moment after, a year later or twenty years after-
wards.
The making of these
records always creates
amusement sometimes
their reproduction, does
too, whilst they have a
very considerable value
as a souvenir as well.
A handy model to choose is the
Edison Amberola No. 30 v (in
Golden Oak Cabinet). It is
compact and portable/ enabl : ng
you to take your music with
you. if you go afield for your
holiday to a week-end camp or
summer cottage.
Yon should obtain details of the
Amberola Recording Outfit at the
nearest Edison dealer’s, or from
Thomas A. Edison, Ltd., 364-372 Kent
Street, Sydney.

All Rexona Girls are beauti-

charming is Miss Cecil Bradley,
who is now appearing in “Going
Up” at the Theatre Royal, Syd-
ney. This charming Australian
artist writes us as follows: —
“I want you to add me to
your list of Rexona girls, for
I truly am one, and I want
to add my praise to Rexona
and Rexona Soap. What a
healer Rexona is! I always
keep one of your dainty
little triangular pots of
Rexona on my dressing-
table, and have one of the
little sample tins that I fill
from the larger pot, and
carry it in my purse where-
ever I go. I always use it
after surfing or being out in
the sun, and once when I
jambed my finger I found it
most soothing and healing.
In emergencies Rexona is
something that can always
be depended upon.
“As for Rexona Soap, I think it is truly delightful—it is so refreshing,
and I find it keeps my complexion in the pink of condition. I used to
use shampoo powders for my hair; now I never use anything but Rexona
Soap It makes a most beautiful shampoo for the hair, and leaves the
hair so soft and lovely. No wonder you see it everywhere, for lam sure
Rexona Soap is a luxury that all girls must appreciate.

The Heart of Finance.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HALF-WAY to the Sydney Post Office
from the Street of Magic is that great
State Lank building that houses
also at times a Governor-General on tour, a
Prime Minister away from home, a sub-
treasurer or national auditors, various
Federal Parliamentarians on the wing, and
a restaurant atop. There is also a nest ot
three elevators and one train-despatcher for
them, and a hundred or two lady financiers
in the making—sleek, golden-haired, brown-
haired, black-haired girls, of blue or black
or grey or green eyes; svelte and thin and
plump and willowy ; short and tall: blondes
and brunes, Junos and Psyches, Suffolk-
punch girls and pony girls 13 hands high ;
physical and spiritual; girls dreamy, neat,
and virgins tutto sungue e busto.
So day by day these angels flutter between
earth and heaven, per one of the three elec-
tric elevators, flying from dull earth which is
the banking chamber to the cool correspond-
ence rooms on the second and third fioorSj and
once or twice a day winging to heaven on
the ninth floor to drink nectar ; at fourpence
a cup and eat angels’ food, with their feet
on a carpet of asphodel made in Axminstei.
Their eyes are a level with the bell sec-
tion of the Post Office tower, and the chimes
of afternoon that tell the customer that the
time of reckoning is at hand say to them
only that liberty is nigh, when young bank-
eress as luscious as a peach shall unex-
pectedly meet youthful banker in Maitin-
place and walk homewards with him, think-
ing only of the debits and credits love enters
in life’s pass-book.
Alice Bardene, one of the offsiders of the
sub-accountant’s department, did not meet
any man-clerk of the bank when 5 o clock
struck to down pens. She had met a client
of the bank, one Ben Richards, a b lat
expert” about to boom into a real-estate
aS The man whom time and inclination led
to the Pitt-street front of the G.P.O. every
afternoon at. 5 o’clock from Monday to l 1 ri-
day inclusive and every Saturday at one
was more ambitious than most of his kind.
As young painters dream of bettering the
work of'Tintoretto, Da Vinci, Angelo, Velas-
quez and Rembrandt all in their one person,
and young writers determine to write a finer
tragedy than “Macbeth” and a better novel
than “The Cloister and the Plearth” and
greater verse than the “Ode to a Nightin-
gale,” so Ben Richards dreamed of being a
Caesar of Real Estate, with a Ben Richards
building a dozen storeys high and the estate-
buying and land-selling populace blocking
Ben Richards’s office with commissions m
marked cheques and cash. Since meeting
Alice he had added a study in still life to
the big canvas of his imagination—Alice
Richards in a limousine waiting for Ben to
close down on the receipt of moneys and
drive home with her to the J>icbards
Palazzo, there to meet a small blue-eyed
girl of two who should be a small edition of
Alice, bound in silk and suitable for a birth-
day present. For Ben was clean as keen;
with the dream of making life a poem
hiding somewhere behind the small rogueries
that stick to commission as wet paint sticks
to a new suit.
Alice was big , and blonde and golden-
haired, and Ben was dapper and slight and
dark and tireless —a human dynamo. Also
he had an idea that anything he could lift
for a second he could carrv forever. When
there were no commissions coming to his
little office and asking to be taken in and
eaten, he didn’t stay there waiting for a
change in the wind to blow profits to him,
but walked the city looking for a bad old
building in a rood street, searching for
squalor that he might turn into magnificence.
And so he brought buildings that had been
forgotten back to the light of day; finding
the seller mostly grown old and careless,
and then searching for a buyer keen for
profits. By the time he had changed the
ownership of two or three he. had something
over a thousand to his credit at the bank
that employed Alice Bardene, and a little
later they met and talked, and one afternoon
ran against each other by purposeful acci-
dent, and next morning appointed the even-
ing of it for each other. And the morning
and the evening were their First Day.
A week or so later they were Othello and
Desdemona before the event —he talking of
all he hadn’t done yet, and she loving him
for the dangers he proposed to face for her.
It was better that way because anticipation
is greater than realisation, and she and Ben
realised that to keep danger for To-morrow
that is never reached was much safer for
Ben. She had none of Ben’s flights of fancy
towards the height of an overdraft that
would not shame Rockefeller. When Ben
said taxi she said tramcar; and when
Ben said ten-and-tenpence for orchestra
stalls she said five shillings for back
stalls; and when Ben urged tribute to profi-
teers in a big restaurant she voted sandwiches
and a round trip to Manly, not leaving the
ferry-boat. But an evening’s entertainment at
the cost of five shillings did not dull the
imagination of Ali Baba Richards, who pro-
posed to despoil the Forty Thieves who own
Sydney’s skyline as seen from the fairway.
As their ferry-boat came back to Sydney
Cove under a sky jewelled with stars to
the electric glare of the City, Ben Richards,
pointing to any place where a break in
the lighting told of an old small building the
rising Babylon had outgrown, said he would
have that, and that, and that To-morrow;
which is the only convenient date for man to
walk to the foot of the rainbow.
And Alice, her cool hand in his sinewy
virile hand, snuggled closer, and said “ies,
dear,” and “That will be grand, won’t it?”
without knowing she .said anything, being,
after the fashion of young woman in love,
concentrated upon the man and careless of
his possessions except that they pleased him;
or of his dreams, except dreams of herself.
But one night he made her interested de-
spite herself.
He had seen the blackness of a little old
house in Pitt-street, and they walked to it
and observed it at all available angles, and
next day he told her he had located the
owner and taken an option; and he left her,
his eyes shining with the light of a fanatic
following the gleam. After a day of search-
ing for a buyer Ben found him, and a few
days later there was another five hundred to
credit; and then in the finding of new com-
missions he was a tiger w T ho had tasted
blood.
A few weeks later Alice suddenly awoke to
the fact that this Ben Richards was a new
one— L kindly as ever, but agreeing too quickly
to her mandates of economy; a little too
ready to cut out restaurants; a little too
satisfied with ferryboat and sandwiches. He
was almost as taciturn as he had been expan-
sive—did not reply immediately when she
questioned, as in the days when he had ap-
peared to have the answer ready before she
asked. And he said he wasn’t ill, and he said he
hadn’t changed; but she disbelieved him,
sought an explanation from herself, and
answered it in the way of woman, who in
her happiness always fears. There must
be new dangers in the streets for the new
bridegroom because she loves him: trams
and horses and automobiles conspire to his
murder because he is very dear, and when
they cease so to conspire use hath made in
her a property of easiness, or love hath
cooled. So she began to think of all the
other girls he knew, and stopped the thought
half-way because she didn’t know all his
acquaintance of her own sex. And so she
thought in a circle—a very unhappy squir-
rel in a cage.
Then Ben didn’t meet her one evening,
■but there was a letter of apology next
morning to square that; and then every
evening for a week he was waiting for her
and seemed to be afraid to let her go from
him. Sundays had been reserved for the
beach, but now he appropriated one for the
city.
“Can’t you drop it even on Sundays, Ben?
It’s not fair.”
“Only to-day. I can’t leave the scene of
the crime, I suppose.”
“Crime? What are you talking about?”
“It’s a crime, a building in George-street.
We’re going to see it.”
It was ugly enough to be called a crime,
and she said so—a faded freestone building
of three storeys with sky-scrapers ascend-
ing by it; a forlorn building once held by
a bank and now vacant but for an auc-
tioneer’s poster in one window advertising
a. clearing sale of furniture, “the property
of a gentleman going abroad—absolutely
unreserved.”
“Look at it all,” he said. “I’ve got an
option on’ that morgue.”
“Well, if you can’t sell it, it won’t kill
you, will it?”
“No —o —o ! But I don’t like being
beaten. And it makes me so mad I feel like
breaking the windows.”
“You’d, be arrested.”
“That might square things, too.”
“Don’t be foolish, Ben. We’ve seen
enough of the morgue, and there’s time for
the beach, after all.”
So they went to the ocean beach, and
Alice ate chocolates and Ben watched green
breakers of the Pacific taking options on
the sands and exercising them every minute.
But he didn’t find his old self any better,
and Alice went home unhappy and Ben
went away gloomily and feared Monday as
a man might fear an enemy at the gate.
Coming from the correspondence, floor in
an elevator filled with girls who should
have been dealing with babies receivable
rather than bills payable, Alice met Ben
Richards as the lift emptied and he emerged
from the bank of femininity that had hidden
him. She saw that he was troubled. Always
a punctilious man, he had not removed his
hat in the elevator —a new convention which
the elevator certainly did not succeed to
as heir to the traffic of the stairs; a con-
vention which makes an elevator rank as
a church, probably because the' elevator
traffics between heaven and earth.
“Oh, Ben,” she said, “did come to
see me?”
“No,” said a very depressed Ben. “I
came to see the sub-manager—l bank here.”
“But there’s nothing wrong, Ben, is
there?”
Ben laughed. “Well, I haven’t robbed
the bank or put the gun to the sub-manager’s

NEVER NEGLECT
a WOUND or SORE.
v»
Zam-Buk is un-
surpassed for the
treatment of poi-
soned wound s,
sores, eczema, boils,
piles, cuts, burns,
scalds and injuries
and diseases of the
skin generally.

Get Zam-Buk, the World’s Most
Wonderful Antiseptic Healer.
NEGLECT of even the tiniest break in the
skin leaves the way open for germs to set up blood-
poisoning and disease.
The safest plan is to keep a box of Zam-Buk always handy,
and immediately dress every Cut, Scratch, Rash, Pimple
or other Skin Trouble with this unique herbal balm. By this
means complications are prevented and healthy healing assured.
Zam-Buk has a power for destroying and repelling skin disease which no
ordinary ointment can possibly have. In addition to special soothing and pain-
killing qualities, Zam-Buk has very powerful antiseptic germicidal properties
which are a bulwark against Blood-poison, Eczema and Ulceration. Zam-Buk,
after thoroughly purifying a Wound or Sore, heals the place by growing
healthy skin.
When any skin trouble is being treated with Zam-Buk Balm, the use of
Zam-Buk Soap (in place of ordinary soaps) will aid the Balm wonderfully in
effecting a speedy cure.
POISONED LIMB SWELLED TO GREAT SIZE.
Wonderful Zam-Buk Healing'.
Froof of Zam-Buk’g wonderful wound-cleansing, flesh-healing
powers is found in the ease of Mr. A. Duff, of “Rio,” 50 Lord
Street, North Sydney. Speaking on his behalf Mrs. Duff says:
“My husband injured his right knee, and some foreign matter
got into the wound and set up inflammation. His knee swelled
to a great size and the pain was dreadful.
“We finally decided to try Zam-Buk, and the first two or
three -applications gave him wonderful ease. With every
application of Zam-Buk great improvement was noticed, and
after only two weeks’ treatment with the Balm, he resumed
work, the wound having healed splendidly.”
“Through a knock on the leg,”
writes Mr. R. J. Hill, of Terrace
Street, Milton, Brisbane, “an
ulcerated sore developed and
caused great pain. For months
it defied treatment, until a
friend’s advice got me to try
Zam-Buk. This wonderful balm
quickly reduced the inflamma-
tion, and healed the leg per-
fectly.”
“Dye got into a simple scratch
on my hand and poisoned it,”
writes Mrs. F. Walters, 214
Bathurst Street, Hobart, Tas-
mania. “The poison spread: my
arm turned black and swelled
right up to the armpit. A
friend recommended me to use
Zam-Buk. From the very first
application it brought wonderful
ease. All swelling and inflam-
mation were overcome. It was
entirely due to Zam-Buk that the
terrible poisoned sore was splen-
didly healed.”

ear, but I seem to have done everything else
that’s wrong.”
‘‘Can I help?”
“How can you? I must clear out now.
See you at five.”
And he was gone northwards where the
horty Thieves live—one of the harried city
men who pray for Blucher or night; for
Blucher, preferably, if he can find money
within banking hours.
In the banking chamber she was told the
reason of her summons from the second
floor: they had made her play theoretical
understudy to a ledger-keeper, and now they
told her to play ledger-keeper for this
matinge oniy. She was introduced to a
perch before a high desk and to the ledgers,
and found herself in charge of accounts “Me
to R.”
It was a light hour of the day, and she
marked a fevv cheques and entered them to
their respective ledger-accounts; and she
made up a passbook in a hurry for a little
man who waited impatiently as if he ex-
pected book-keeping by wireless in a code
more condensed than Morse. Then, with
half-a-minute to think in, the thoughts
homed to her man—and naturally the ledger-
leaves turned of themselves to the attraction
of her curiosity. And there was the account
of “Ben Richards, estate agent, Pitt-street,
city.”
The of the account shocked her.
The £l5OO of profits he had talked of were
not there; the account: was £250 in debit,
and if she were to judge by Ben’s anxiety
after the interview with the sub-manager,
the Medes and Persians could teach the sub-
manager nothing in fixing an unalterable
limit.
What had been done with the £l5OO
which he had told her was ear-marked to
begin the buying of their home? If he
were speculating there must surely be some-
thing in the bank to show for it, although
the little overdraft seemed to be quite un-
secured and advanced on personal honor.
Had there been any security the sub-man-
ager would be unlikely to send away Ben
despairing as he seemingly had done that
day.
Thought in the absence of a datum be-
came circular again; the business of other
customers took her away from it, the rush
of trade greater than usual, because Good
Friday was to-morrow, and the bank after
o o clock that day would be closed till Tues-
day.
The strokes of 3 o’clock reverberated from
the _ Post Office tower; the returned-soldier
janitors closed the doors as if in a hurry
to suspend payment; the last open cheques
were entered and marked, and the last ex-
change before Easter came in—later than
usual because it was to be the last clear-
ance for four days.
In the sheaf handed to ledger “Me to R”
there were 40-odd cheques, and—she seemed
to kriow before reaching it—the last was
her lover’s, an order to pay Edward Prince
£5OO, -signed “Ben J. Richards” with the
Avell-known: and greatly-admired curl to the
J —a porky tendril such as grows on the
southern elevation of little pigs.
Alice would have scorned the comparison,
probably because it was true, and also be-
cause she was so sentimental at this proof
of the unfortunate Ben J.’s difficulty* that
she felt like kissing the cheque and then
crying over it. But being a girl of good
sen.se she knew that the sight of a ledger-
keeper—even an understudy given the part
for one matinee only—kissing a cheque, and
crying over it, might cause a financial crisis ;
and so she went on with the work and
thought of Ben and loved him more than
ever.
She had returned his cheque to the under-
level of the sheaf, and wished and wished
that that debit of £250 might be changed
to a credit of £5OOO, and knew it could not
be, and ached the more for all the pains
ot Ben.
The great clock in the tower opposite
chimed the half-hour—clearance was almost
completed. She reached for her lover’s
cheque, and told herself she could not send
it back. And then, escaping thought of
consequence with speed, she entered the
cheque, making Ben Richards’s overdraft
£750, and answered the cheque as good.
Then she hurried through the work as if
she feared immediate discovery, and as soon
as she could fled from the bank and home
to hide herself, not daring to meet Ben or
stay in the city; thanking God that dis-
covery must wait over Easter, and that she
need not plead for mercy for five days yeti
Ben waited for her at the great door until
the last elevator had discharged its last
virginal financier, and that night he sought
her at her house, but saw her only for
a few moments because she escaped to bed,
afraid to,tell him of what she had done, and
wondering now whether she had not done
him an injury. For why should not that
sub-manager of the hard heart and the ever-
to-be-accursed memory believe that the
granting of that unauthorised overdraft had
been a matter of arrangement, a lovers’ con-
spiracy for sordid and dishonest ends? If
this were so to be, then she had done her
lover an injury he could never forgive—
ruined him for the city; might even have
opened for him the doors of Long Bay pri-
son. She was too afraid to cry, and lay all
night quaking in apprehension.
But sunlight came to his duty, which is
to tell everybody that night thoughts are
blacker than they should be, and that, no
matter how bad things are, they might be
worse. And Ben came along early, and
having been taught by her that the best'
things are the cheapest and all the best
gifts of the world —love, water, sunlight—
are ours for nothing, he proposed, not a
taxi-drive, but the cheap amusement of
Taronga Park —by cheap ferry to the Zoo.
Alice wondered a little if the debit balance
she knew of had any bearing on this cheer-
ful acceptance of pleasure with economy,
but she didn’t think of it long. Indeed, she
ran aw r ay from the consideration of it. They
talked of anything to hide their real
anxieties. Ben did not talk options nor look
for obsolete buildings on the skyline, and
Alice tried to forget the existence of banking
which protective love had in a moment
changed to a fine art.
So they fed the seals, and laughed at the
chimpanzee and his friend the fox-terrier,
and so floated back to the city in the cool
night that was fortunately almost chill and
made them sit close together publicly.
But never a word ot dithcutty or finance
for all Easter, until at parting on Easter
Monday night, when she pressed him to tell
her of his troubles. Then he said, “it will be
all right, I think. I was bothered about a
cheque which was to go in yesterday, but
I find it was paid in at a branch otfice and
couldn’t get there till Tuesday morning.”
Oppressed with the greater knowledge
Alice rushed the opportunity of telling him
a little of the truth. Carefully watching the
effect she said: “There was a special late,
exchange from all city branches because of
the four days’ holiday.”
The man became all gloom again, and then
despair reacted into new courage.
“If it must be it must be,” he said. “I’ll
get to it to-night and early to-morrow and
find the worst. It’S this way, Al, I bought
that morgue in George-street.”
“Bought it? Not an option?”
“No. Straight-out purchase. I paid fifteen
hundred down a month ago and gave a
cheque for five hundred to extend the con-
tract a fortnight. I wanted it. And they
wouldn’t give an option.”
“And how much is it altogether?”
“Twenty-five thousand !”
“Oh, you must have been mad!”
“I’m not. I’ve given an option over it
for thirty thousand, and I ought to know
to-morrow. I’ll have to get the five hundred
somehow. If I don’t get that I lose the lot.”
“And if you do get it and don’t complete
you’ll only be losing five hundred more.”
“That’s right. But I’ve got a day for the
five hundred and a fortnight for the balance
of the twenty-five thousand. I won’t give
in till I’m beaten, anyhow.”
“Oh, the fool I was!” said the repentant
she-banker after Richards had gone. “If he
can’t sell before the bank finds out I’ve
ruined poor Ben —and he may be arrested,
too. I’m a fool, a fool! And I meant it for
the best.”
Next dgy she did a masterly thing to con-
quer her fear. She didn’t go near it; she
stayed at home.
Then the bank sent a messenger and Alice
replied that she was very ill and would
attend to-morrow, hoping all the time that
she would be too ill to leave her room.
But Ben came out that night—a new Ben,
bright-eyed, walking like a conqueror.
“I cleaned it up,” said Ben—“got five
thousand deposit, and round I went to the
sub-manager. ‘There y’are,’ I says, ‘what
did I tell you? You wouldn’t provide for
that five-hundred cheque last Thursday and
I had to risk it coming in. But it couldn’t
have come in; because the neople I bought
the property of were as sweet as a nut to
me just now. They may be asking a special
answer for it, though ; so will you just see
she’s all right?’ Well, away he goes, Al,
and in ten minutes back he comes, and says
‘That cheque was paid on Thursday!’ ‘How
could it be?’ I asked him, and ‘Who paid in
to meet it?’ ‘Nobody,’ he says, ‘but it was
paid, and you know it.’ ‘You’re mad,’ I says.
‘How could I know you’d pay after refusing
me?’ He’s a little shuffy old chap, and when
he’s surprised his eyes go round and so does
his mould like three capital O’s.
Alice nodded. “I know.”
“ ‘You must know the ledger-keeper,’ he
says. ‘That cheque was paid without refer-
ence to me, and then entered up in the ledger
—all in regular order. And very irregular
it is. You're seven Hundred and fifty over-
drawn,’ he says, ‘and the bank thought it was
only two-fifty.’ ‘l’m not overdrawn at all,’
I says. ‘Here’s a bank cheque for five thou-
sand, and I’m my own man again. And
don’t you blame anybody for doing anything
for me. I don’t know your ledger-keeper
, from a bar of soap.’ ”
‘‘Are you sure of that, Ben?”
“Of course. Who is he?”
“It isn’t who is he, but who was she?”
“She —why, what do you mean?”
“She —an emergency ledger-keeper. Ben,
I was put into that desk for the afternoon.”
“And you saved the cheque?”
“Yes, and when I thought of it I was
afraid to tell.”
“Well, you little—there! Take that!
And then take that! You’re the best in the
world.”
“Let me breathe, Ben. And the sub-
manager suspects. He might prosecute, just
to make an example. He’s the kind of man
to do that. And it was really criminal to
do it.”
“Go and see him to-morrow. He’s hurt.
But I’ve given him the best ointment and
that’s money.”
“But he mightn’t forgive .me for his
fright. I’ll see him ; I’m not afraid. And
if he bullies me I’ll—l’ll resign.”
Ben laughed uproariously. “Resign and
put him in the wrong, eh ? You women!
You women! You’ll resign, anyhow, A 1;
you can keep our own books —the books for
my office.”
The sub-manager had had liis fright, and
didn’t forgive the author of it.
“It was an indefensible thing to do. It
looked like a conspiracy between you. You
see, I’d seen you with Mr. Richards after-
noon after afternoon, and I thought that
at once. I’m very pleased to know that he
was ignorant of it —glad to think it was
only a girl’s foolish impulse.”
“It was impulse, but it wasn’t foolish.”
“Of course, we couldn’t overlook it.”
“I am resigning to-day—l am going to
be married.”
“Congratulations!” said Old Formula
stiffly, but just as if he were a human being
—“I also congratulate the bank.”
“So do I,” said Alice, all smiles again.
“I wouldn’t trust. anybody like myself
among all this money.”
“It’s not an occupation for women,” said
Formula —-“and it’s unhealthy for us, too.
Woman has a high vocation, and I hope a
safer one. The hand that rules the cradle
rooks the bank —if it helps the baby’s
father.”
So Alice Richards was appointed ledger-
keeper for the two accounts A. and 8.J.,
with household disbursements on the debit
side; and already there is a large baby to
credit.

Words to the Wise
Most of us ettfofmg good
health and spirits are
careless of our diet.
and oftener than we should, foods which
sooner or later upset the stomach. Then trouble sets in,
faking the form of biliousness, indigestion, sleeplessness,
dizziness and languor. We feel ill, cross and stupid; we
become bores to our friends and to ourselves; life
becomes a thing of horror not worth living. Yet, all
this is absolutely unnecessary. Stop, think a moment!
