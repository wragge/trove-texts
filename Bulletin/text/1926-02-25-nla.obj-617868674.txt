Literary Judgments
in a recently published book called “Later
Days,” W. H. Davies, “the tramp poet or
England,” describes a visit he paid to Joseph
Conrad. Conrad gave him a copy of "Vic-
tory,” and he took it away and read it. Hut
lie could not see in it anything more than
pure melodrama. Then he tried to read
“I xml Jim,” but could manage only the
first 40 pages. Davies, though a much
older man, was a friend of Rupert Brooke,
whom lie seemed to love for his brilliant
“boyousiless” more than anything else. But
he will not have it for a moment that Rupert
Brooke was a great poet. “Rupert Brooke, .
he writes, “was not only not a great poet, ins
work shows not the least sign that lie evei
would ha>ve become one.” But when Davies,
on Conrad’s advice, reads “Green Mansions,
by W. H. Hudson, he is thrilled and cannot
find words praiseful enough. The charm in
Davies’s work that holds one is made up ot
two things—his utter lack of pretence and
his very evident truthfulness and sincerity.
His quite extraordinary literary judgments,
then open up the whole question of what
really does constitute a measuring standard
of literary work, . . , ,
There is for a man only one such standard
‘—that man’s personal life-experience, lucre
is another standard he too often employs,
that too often warps and confuses Ins judg-
ment and robs him of the pure enjoyment lie
might get from the work did he only bring
his life-experience to the measuring of it.
That is his scholarship. When a man judges
the work of a book by comparing it with
other books lie has read he is really
being very futile. Sir Joshua Reynolds once
wrote of certain people: “They debar them-
selves from receiving any pleasure from the
polite arts at the same time as they profess
to love and admire them; for, instead of
'giving the reins of their imagination into the
author’s hands,, their turgid minds are em-
ployed in examining whether the perform-
ance be according to the rules of Art. ’ This
is very true. To really enjoy a book we must
project ourselves —our real selves or our
dream selves —into it, and find mirrored
in it one or both of those selves. If we do
not find ourselves in the book, then it can
mean little or nothing to us, it is alien to our
life-experience, and, whatever its reputation,
we should not: pretend that it is anything to
US, Though it be a great book for all the
rest of the world, it is not a great book for
us. The trouble is that few of us are honest
enough to give our true opinions. W e use
our words to impress rather than to reveal.
We consider too much the reputation we
have, or hope some day to get.
That is why it is so refreshing to come
across the work of a man like Davies. Me
all have different life-experiences behind us;
we all have different imaginative selves.
Therefore all art works must have different
values for all of us. Davies is a nature
poet, and it is quite evident that he lias
never been a “woman’s man.” He has
tramped the open road, and men who sleep
under hedges and congregate over mugs of
ale ill inn parlors mean much to him. bo
do birds and trees and meadows and streams.
But it is evident that in his younger impres-
sionable days he had little to do with women.
Flirtations and love-affairs were foreign to
his nature. Therefore, Rupert Brooke s
poems “Kindliness,” “Menelaus and
Helen,” “Dead Men’s Love” and others like
them—-to many men the most grimly Truth-
ful things ever written about the subjects—
must be meaningless and without appeal.
In much the same way because of his life-
experience, which is the way his tempera-
ment has made him feel and see things, he
finds more of the men and women he has met
and the life he has led in Dickens than in
Conrad. The tremendous fatefulness that
makes Conrad for so many people most
powerfully dramatic writer since _ Sliaks-
peare is foreign to Davies’s imagination, bo
his mind rejects it, and only the melodrama
that he quite enjoys in “Victory” remains.
It is vastly different with “Green Man-
sions.” Here the self that lie knows so well
and seeks —as we all do in all works of art
rushes forth, as it were, to meet him. Here
is the man who loves what he loves, thinks
the thoughts he thinks, and describes those
very things and experiences he would de-
scribe, as lie would describe them, if lie
could. He enjoys this book to the full and
his enjoyment is unalloyed by -any , won-
dering as to whether the book is a great
one or not. or how his reputation will be
affected if he says it is ii great one or not.
He does not rush his mind off to compare
the book with, say, “White’s Natural History
of Selborne” or sortie ancient classic. Nor
does he quote what other people have said
about it. Montaigne called his book of essays
“a book of good faith.” It is this “good faith
that gives those essays their great charm.
Alike “good > faith” pervades “Later Days”
and gives it charm too.
Davies is 55, and can still enjoy, and is
wise enough to seek his enjoyment where
there is a possibility of his finding it. Too
much learning has not brought weariness
of the flesh to him nor made him prema-
turely old. Because of this and his simple
honesty and sincerity, his prose work, with
its very naive sense of humor and its quaint,
healthy egotism, is very to read.
ALAN D. MICKLE.
Stress, Accent and Quantity
The question of the scansion of English
verse which Bartlett Adamson raises is not
quite as easily answered as he would have us
believe; and we arc not likely to be helped
much towards a solution by consulting a
work on prosody. Mr. Adamson introduces
a little light and tender insanity into his
discussion of the problem by including under
the term “blank verse" all that bulk of Eng-
lish production which rhymes most fiercely
of all. The least blank of all our verse is
the so-called “heroic measure’ which walks
on five even feet and not only has endings
of the orthodox soft, but hatnmers (hose end-
ings home with an emphatic bang. The
movement of blank verse differs greatly from
anything possessing rhyme —though its actual
scansion when written down may seem very
much the same —for the definite reason that
it must produce its effect without the aids
which help the rhyming verse out.
But the heart and centre of Mr. Adam-
son’s argument is a confusion between the
idea of an accented syllable and a stress in
reading. No stress can destroy the regular
procession of accented and unaccented syl-
lables which ripple on their way both m
prose and verse; and stress is often variable.
Thus in reading the first line of “Paradise
Lost"—
Of mail's first disobedience and the fruit
you can make four stresses or two, as you
please, but you cannot get away from the
effect of 10 syllables. Half a syllable or so
is slurred over in the fourth word : but that
is not worth taking account of in the present
discussion. What is worth taking notice ot
is that if the last word were altered to
‘‘apricot” the stresses would remain exactly
the same but the. metre would not. .
Where all works on prosody are apt to
lead ns astray is in their confusion of Greek
and Latin methods with our own. lfie
classic languages of the ancient world appear
to have been spoken much more slowly and
emphatically than we speak ours, with a fuller
value.given to all open vowel sounds. Luc
scansion in these languages was by quantity,
not by accent. Feet were made by the recur-
rence of long and short syllables, not by the
patter of accented and unaccented syllables;
and it is therefore somewhat ridiculous to
base our verse-making on the names and
forms of the past. Clearly, long vowels and
short vowels being the basis, classic
must walk very straight and pick their steps
most accurately; while on a basis of accent
there is a lot of room for dainty tripping and
sliding about without the los| of the metrical
movemeiit. A hint of scansion by quantity
is sometimes present in English verse,. and
no doubt accent did a good deal for Greek
metres, but on the whole it is better to
recognise that the metrical methods are
different, and so ease our minds of problems
which need be no problems at all. Instead
of going left, right, left, right all the time,
many of the finest lines in English go off
right, left, left, right ; but as long as the
ear is not worried why make a riot over it ?
Scansion by stress is a real thing also,
and by no means to be lightly brushed aside,
though it is pretty evident that in English
it must always play a secondary part to
accent. It came to us from Irish Gaelic. A
certain Mary MacLeod invented it as late as
the end of the sixteenth century in the island
of Skye; it was at once accepted on the
popular voice as an improvement, and in a
century or so it had captured all Ireland.
The oidcr bards, with their orthodox verse
following its 2000-odd rules, complained
bitterly of the new' and looser form; but
it gradually conquered them and then
attempted a similar conquest in English,
where the genius of the language was entirely
different. In certain verse —notably English-
Irish vei-se which follows a mode of speech
carrying a certain rather glow intonation —
the positions of the stresses, are certain and.
the irregular look of the lines does not pre-
vent their accurate scansion;. but as stress-
scanned verse is used by many English
writers of to-day the position’ of the stresses
varies in the mouth of almost every reader,
and it is difficult to find any sort of scansion
at all.
Over and above all these there is, of course,
free verse —the real free verse in which the
words follow a prose sequence and an elusive
rhythm, but in which the rhymes are true
and clear. Verse of this sort cannot stand
by any rule, but is dependent for its charm
and strength upon a certain inevitable move-
ment. Without the rhymes that inevitable
movement has never yet proved itself. The
American horrors of recent perpetration are
no more than bad and tortured prose; rhyme
is absolutely necessary to give such work
balance and coutrol.
The whole matter of scansion may be
wisely left to thd trained ear. Just as very
few people learn ordinary English grammar
by any method except accurate reading of
good work, so prosody, which is itself a
branch of that grammar, can only be fully
acquired by reading good verse. The text-
books —like the rhyming dictionaries, which
are crammed with false rhymes—mislead a
great deal more than they edify. I cannot
tell Mr. Adamson why so many lines in blank
verse will take four stresses if you squeeze
them to it, nor does the fact greatly worry
me. I know that a lot of lines which are
not blank verse, wall take four stresses also.
I cannot tell why “Hyperion” and the second
book of “Paradise Lost” begin on what
should be the wrong beat, but I am glad they
do it. As in the legal processes of Equity,
everything depends on established precedent
except the new rulings of thoughtful Judges,
so in verse the mighty mass of precedent is
our only sure guide, but anybody is per-
mitted to give a new ruling which his ear
and emotions justify. The purity of his ear
and the strength of his emotions may in the
end give his departure the force of law.

Frank Harris is Annoyed
A man does not write all the way from
Nice to Sydney a letter of abusive inco-
herence mixed with cries of a childish vanity
and without any pretence at intellectual analy-
sis unless lie feels that he has been badly hit.
I therefore gratefully accept the very unex-
pected tribute of Frank Harris’s paragraph
(R.P. 4/2/'2(i) on me and my article.
To the taunt of being an “unknown son”
1 might ask bow Harris knows my genealo-
gical table if I am so blacked out with
obscurity, and how he would have appreci-
ated the taunt himself at tin' age _of 25.
However, I will not try to disturb this snob-
bery of wisdom, this conviction of haying
something youth clearly has not (namely,
years), which probably helps the old to a
complacent death. But I fiwl that in the
haste of his rage Harris has not read my
article fairly. While making no effort to

Always Bcttcr-Now Improved
Sturdier and more efficient, better looking,
these new Republics are the outstanding
achievement in truck engineering of a decade.
The engines are most economical for their
power. The frames are much deeper, and
most scientifically cross-braced. The radiators
are of new design. The tyres are larger. The
springs are heavier. The axles are oil-bathed
to the very ends. The braking is exclusive.
Shifting is easier. Steering is lighter. There
is extreme accessibility. There is an air-cleaner.
There is not an unimproved spot on these
greater new yellow chassis Republics.
They are bettering even the traditional Republic
economy and endurance records, which have
always outstripped other trucks. They are
trucks of more miles and less gallons; with
more use on the road and less days in the shop.

DAVID JONES’
combat or discuss its thesis, lie might at
Loot have read my remarks in the relation
n which they were made. Thus, he asserts
Saf i called y Ids “Contemporary Portraits”
“poor” What I really did was to refer to
their muddle of “truth, invention and the
hodge-podge of a generation’s gossip com-
mandeered as experiences ot ins own.
But they might be all that and yet be the
finest character-sketches on earth not that
I consider them quite so unique, though 1
certainly agree that some of them are admir-
able and clever summings-up of character.
But I did not think that the most fervent
Harrisite, or even Harris himself, would
have claimed them to be faultlessly truthful
as to the part Harris plays in them. Harris,
I thought, used the perfectly legitimate
method of grouping incidents round himselt
or of relating them to himself personally, in
order to obtain verisimilitude, when the
stories or remarks were more or less general
property. Harris’s method becomes threadbare
in some of the sketches, and this procedure is
unmistakably shown : the “\\ agner, for in-
stance, which demonstrates the curious fact
that Wagner used to go about quoting from
Harris’s autobiography; or the “Dunsany,”
where he hides from us that he knows nothing
whatever personally about the man in ques-
tion by means of a letter with the opening
(obviously the exposing “Dear Mr. Harris,”
or something like it) carefully removed.
Still, some of the sketches, particularly
the earlier ones, are striking enough; and
the Wilde biography, if not all its admirers
have claimed it to be, ranking it with Bos-
well, etc., is, in contrast with the usual type,
a very live work. Moreover, some of Harris’s
short stories seem to be interesting produc-
tions, though “Montes tlie Matador,” which
he is always republishing with Meredith’s
comment starred and generally with Mer-
rimSe’s “Carmen” attached with a depreci-
atory comparison, is not so impressive.
“The Bomb” owes its success among the
proletariat and the earnest modernist of the
outer ring to qualities almost all outside
literature. In my opinion perhaps the best
work Harris has done has been in his Shaks-
pearean commentaries. Although I could
bicker with him endlessly on minor points of
exegesis, I admit heartily that he invented
an altogether new relationship to Shaks-
peare, a new instrument of vital scholarship.
He was the first man to realise clearly the
extreme sensuality of Sliakspeare, to see the
real meaning of the curious passionate ellipse
of Shakspeare’s mind through his work. He
was the first to try seriously to see Shaks-
peare, not as a mythical abstraction, a nexus
of intellectual dramatic effects, but as a
human being meeting the action of life with a
desperate and shattering recoil of desire. I
could never sufficiently thank him for en-
throning “Antony and Cleopatra” as the
central work of Shakspeare’s, the key to the
whole construction of his mind, body and
emotions. It was Harris who gave it once
and for all this position, and no one now-
adays disputes its right except university
professors, and even they will have surren-
dered in about 50 years’ time.
But Harris, despite the fact that all his
life ihe lias been involved one way or another
with literature, is not a literary character.
All who have known him have stressed the
fervid and restless animation of his mind;
lie lives in a series of nervous explosions.
Writers as far apart as Mencken and Max
Beerbohm have united in praising him as a
conversationalist. He is primarily a man
of action, rushing from one scheme to an-
other, too violent ever to carry any of them
to completion or even plan them comprehen-
sively. His reaction to Sliakspeare shows
a genuine understanding of the creative im-
age, and yet the appeal of pity never cried
in vain to his insatiable Inst for a noble
attitude. To this day he is torii between
Apollo and Jesus, refusing to recognise the
incompatibility of their godheads, intellectu-
ally upholding one. emotionally at the mercy
of the other, seeking for a strong aesthetic
of life and yet continuously submerged by
weak impulses, trying to save the world and
to create Harris simultaneously. His style is
mirror of the man ; it is all ragged edges,
jumpy ; even where smooth on the surface
there is the hot, bristly feeling of Harris’s
personality beneath.
I sincerely believe that Harris began his
“Life and Loves” with a keen intention to
write a frank lyric song to the happy sensu-
alities of life; but his lack of style ran away
with him, and as the corruption of the best
is always the worst, his lilies turned out
festering weeds. To write of sex is either
the hardest or the easiest thing in the world,
according as one chooses one’s method.
With Harris it was the easiest.
I am sorry in one way to have had this
quarrel with a man much of whose work,
incomplete as it is, I like very much, even
admire. But the book under discussion is
a hopeless thing, definitely depressing all
poetic imagery of desire, all the lyrical
laughters of the flesh, by its microscopic
and tawdrily-written details.
JACK LINDSAY.
Nature and Art
“Everything in Nature,” “W.M.W.” re-
cently wrote, “takes its place with wonder-
ful rhythm.” This is also the belief of the
Eskimo, but any artist who has sat down
with an empty canvas before him, and then
stared in anguish and despair at a landscape
comprising a pink landslide, an impossibly
hard green sky above an absurdly soft blue
range, the whole flung out of balance by
an untidy group of Scotch thistles in the
foreground, will enthusiastically disagree
with him. Otherwise we must suppose that
floods, subterranean fires and earthquakes
are arranging the world according to the
principles of textbook Aesthetics. Nature,
in fact, however beautiful in detail, is in-
corrigibly slovenly in general. She has no
more notion of composition than a roads-
board engineer. If “W.M.W.” does not be-
lieve this, let him hie to the open fields and
liohl up an empty frame in any direction he
cares to. If the four sides of the thing en-
close a perfect composition—or, to use his
term, a rhythm—-it will be due to an acci-
dent and no design of nature, who has no
more ability to arrange her several parts into
a painter’s composition than a woodheap
has of converting itself into a suite of fur-
niture.
Painters, as a fact, behave in precisely the
same way as the New Movement artists
when preparing nature for human consump-
tion. They rearrange, suppress, enhance,
distort and otherwise take pardonable liber-
ties with the panorama, and their most real-
istic effort is only at the best an approxi-
mation. If “W.M.W.” does not believe this,
let him borrow any of the pictures he has
singled out for praise—the Streeton, for
instance —and, taking it to the actual scene
of the artist’s inspiration, compare the painted
version with the actual scene as presented
by nature and note the discrepancies.
He will make some interesting discoveries,
including the fact that the artist conveys his
meaning to his audience by a number of
extremely arbitrary conventions which have
no resemblance to visual appearances. They
may even have a definite national signifi-
cance. I once entrusted the hanging of my
small collection of Lindsays, Julian Ashtons,
Starks, etc., to a Javanese boy when I lived
in his country. He hung them all upside
down except the Lindsays, which had some
faint suggestion in them of his own fantastic
art of the shadow-show.
Here let me state that I hold no brief
for the New Movement as such. Much of
it deserves all the diatribes levelled by
“W.M.W.” plus the bad language of the
astonished Indian colonel who wandered into
the New English Art show in London to
buy a birthday present for his wealthy
maiden aunt. But I don’t include the pic-
tures by Bunny. Bunny, to my mind, lias
felt the vibrating atmosphere and the vivid
colors of France and Italy right to the mar-
row of his bones, and has transferred his
sensations successfully to canvas.
M.G.S.
School Songs
The comments of A. C. Welsh (R.P.
31/12/’25) on the teaching of singing in
Victorian schools are equally and sadly true
with regard to Queensland schools. At one
country school in the northern State the
crowning effort at a breaking-up was the
fatuous “There You Are, Then,” sung in
chorus by the children ; at another a willing
but misguided youngster was led on to the
stage, wearing a black mask, to sing that
imbecile travesty of song, “Sing-Along-
Sambo,” which he did in a monotonous
voice and a self-satisfied manner, doubtless
reflecting the capacity and taste of his
teacher.
May I supplement Mr. Welsh’s list with
the following, which are a few of the songs
taught in my schooldays? Obviously no
attempt is made to set them in their order
of merit:—
Forty Years Oil.
The Bluebells of Scotland.
Oft in the Stilly Night.
The Snider and the Fly.
The Massacre of McPherson.
Ye Gentlemen of England and The Aretliusa.
The Minstrel Boy.
Sweet and Low.
Where the Bee Sucks.
I Know a Bank Whereon the Wild Thyme Grows.
Browning’s Epilogue and Heroes.
To the list of school song-books given by
Mr. Welsh teachers might profitably add
Farmer’s “Gaudeamus.”
Incidentally, a certain speech-day is
memorable to the writer on account of an
experiment in singing the National Anthem
rather quickly. We had not rehearsed; we
had merely been cautioned. The result was
not particularly brilliant; but a precedent
was set which has been followed. I think
successfully, by that school ever since. The
funereal tempo associated with the National
Anthem is surely an unnecessary convention,
the destruction of which might well be the
first step in any programme of reform insti-
tuted by those responsible for the elementary
musical instruction of Young Australia.
M. RICHARDSON JONES.
A Satchel of Books
The Woodcraft Trail, by Marcus Woodward
(Geoffrey Bles). A little nature book intended for'
the use of Girl Guides and other similar organisations,
and admirable for its purpose.
Letters of Samuel Johnson (Oxford Press). One
of the neatly-got-up pocket volumes in “The World’s
Classics” series. To the general reader the “Letters”
do not make the appeal of Boswell’s “Life”; they
lack vivacity.
Moore’s Almnnal!)2C> (Philip and Son). Per-
haps like no man no book is indispensable, but in
the N. S. Wales office and the business house this
red-jacketed old friend comes very near it.’ The
present is the seventy-fifth year of publication.
The Lord’s Prayer and the Sacraments, by Percy
Dearmer, D.D. (Heffer). This completes the series
of “Lessons on the Way” compiled for the use
of inquirers and teachers. Written in what the
author thinks is the vernacular, and none the better
for it.
Gas-Drive In. by E. J. Rath (G. H. Watt, New
York). A brightly-written yarn about adult Ameri-
cans who have nothing to do but make love, drive
around in high-powered automobiles and spend
money. The principal ingredients of the plot are
a stolen car and a missing letter.
For Love and Honor, by Ethel B. Taylor (A. H.
Stockwell). An Australian novel dedicated by its author
to “the land of my adoption—my beloved North
Queensland.” This indicates the setting of the story.
Although showing many of the shortcomings of an
unskilled hand, the little tale is not without merit,
and will appeal to those who appreciate old-fashioned
romance.
Contrasts, by Marjorie Weatherly (Robertson and
Mullens). Prose and metrical compositions by an
Australian writer, Mrs. M. Carter, who has used her
maiden name for pen purposes. Though the work is
without distinctive originality or exceptional strength,
the writer shows refinement and delicacy of thought,
with a genuine love of nature. The daintily-got-up
booklet is illustrated by photographs, and is more
for circulation among friends than for a wide public.
Palestine and Pamela, by Edith Buckmaster
(Heffer and Sons). The modest claim that this
little volume is merely “a chat with the unlearned
on the Holy Land” disarms criticism. A journey
through the Holy Land is seized as a fitting oppor-
tunity for chastening the pessimistic spirit of the
author’s niece, Pamela, who is asked to “forgive a
caricature drawn with no unkindly feeling.” Ah,
we’ve heard that before and tasted the same slipper!
The Diary of a Young Lady of Fashion, edited by
A. B. Kerr (Thornton Butterworth). Miss Cleone
Elizabeth Knox, the merry and amazingly candid young
Irishwoman who wrote this journal in 1764-65,
gives modern readers a highly diverting and interest-
ing glimpse at the fashionable life of that period.
Worth reading if only for the reflection that the
woman of the seventeenth and her sister of the twen-
tieth century are much the same under their rouge.
Motor Trade Directory of Australia (third edition).
This helps one to understand how Sydney can stage
the biggest motor show in the Southern Hemisphere
with 60 of the biggest agencies in the city standing
out. It takes 762 pages to accommodate a list of
all the Australian businesses that are clustered round
the petrol-driven vehicle. The arrangement of the
directory, always intelligent and helpful, has been
improved, and it can answer any question that can
reasonably be put to it (and a few that you wouldn't
expect it to) in a second or so.
The Children’s Punch, edited by M. Theresa Bryan
(Country Life, Ltd.). Few would regard the pages
of London Punch as a happy hunting-ground for
children’s verse. The editor has, nevertheless, suc-
ceeded in making a collection which, while it has its
appeal to young readers, is not without interest to
the adult. Many of the illustrations are taken from
far-back years; others are modern. So also with
Ihe contributors. Among the moderns are Kipling and
A. P. Herbert, our recent guest at the Press con-
ference.
The New Booh of Country Contentments, by
Marcus Woodward (Geoffrey Bles). “Early in May
the voice of the turtle-dove is due to be heard again
in the land’’—the quotation furnishes a key to the
contents of this volume of papers contributed to the
English periodical press. But it is quite too shock-
ing to think what the Australian cocky - would say
if shown the impressionistic picture of an alleged
sheep and lamb portrayed by the illustrator, or made
to listen to the “contentments” about starlings, St.
John’s wort and the rabbit and the fox.
This Charming Green Hat-fair, by Barry Pain
(Werner Laurie). Readers of Michael Arlen’s “The
Green Hat,” a brilliant but wholly unconvincing
piece of work, will at once see the salient features
in it which lend themselves to parody. Mr. Pain’s
heroine sums up the matter when at a dinner party
she lets her hand fall like a rose petal on the sleeve
of a bishop and confides to him that she has “a
pagan body but a Chislehurst mind.” To enjoy
this clever bit of work, which is without trace of
malice, involves the perusal of Arlen’s novel-—and
that's its handicap.
Builders of the Empire, by Jas. A. Williamson
(Oxford Press). In tracing the building of the vast
edifice of the British Empire, the author has
grouped the workmen into pioneers of the old
colonial Empire lost to us by the War of Indepen-
dence, leaders in the conquests and annexations of
the eighteenth century, and statesmen in the modern
expansion of our past gains. Without having any-
thing new to say, the author or compiler has put
into a reasonable compass a succinct and graphic
outline of the Empire’s development.
The Testament of Dominic Burleigh, edited by
Godfrey Elton (Allen and U.nwin). Not to every
man comes the opportunity, or misfortune, of reading
his own obituary notices. By a series of strange
happenings that is what befell Dominic Burleigh,
Fellow of St. Peter’s College, Oxford, D. 5.0., war-
poet. His testament is a self-revelation set against
the flattering presentment of his biographers. Tear-
ing his life to pieces, he finds beneath the reputation
of high learning and great physical daring a “mean,
pretentious, little, writhing thing.” Out of the
presumptive death of an old life he constitutes a new
which will have at its basis unflinching truth:
“Truth in politics, in literature. Truth in society.
Truth which means distinction .jo all three of them ;
for truth is the great, the only, revolutionary.”
Bitter, caustic and sometimes cynical, yet doing the
vital work of the surgeon with his knife.
John 11. Patterson, by Samuel Crowther (Geoffrey
Pies). What Ford is in the motor world Patter-
son was in the domain of the National Cash Register.
It was not till he had reached 40 that he saw a
clear line before him. Within that period he had
dabbled in many things and learned that he could
not co-operate; so that when in 1884 he took over
the register business —a small affair then —he deter-
mined that he and he alone would control it. From
that day on till his death he was dictator. His
methods were cruel. He “fired” his men for any,
and sometimes for no apparent, reason. “The firing
of a man because he was too valuable was part of
Mr. Patterson’s plan, gradually worked out through
the years, of trying to make an institution rather
than a collection of individuals,” It seems to have
been his scheme for whipping-up the whole staff to a
high degree of efficiency and not letting the best of
the feast go to an indispensable few'. None dare
think himself secure where so many were his equals,
“The whole policy was to keep men on their toes.”
On the sales side he cut out the direct salesman
on salary. He sold on commission. But before
the agents, inoculated -with the Patterson
enthusiasm and the prospect of a flood of dollars,
Sot to work, their putative victims were bom-
barded with advertising matter. “He borrowed from
the patent-medicine people the wrinkle of attaching
testimonials of satisfied users.” Later he thought
he might further stimulate his bagmen by a little
fillip from the home. So he attacked the wives,
They were advised as to the value of nourishing food
for their husbands, good hours, and avoiding too
much social diversion. Classes were held to teach
salesmanship to them, and right tips were drawn up
for their guidance. Thus, with freak advertising,
persistent pressure and the clamor of the countless
ann . v of demonstrating salesmen, the cash register
pressed its way into every U.S.A. store, and then
the foreign trade was taken in hand. And what
did Patterson get out of it? A fortune? Yes, an
immense one. As to the rest: “He really did not
know what pleasure was. He did not know the
meaning of the word ‘recreation.’ He thought of
pleasure and recreation not as things of themselves,
b } lt; a ® aids to efficiency. He would urge a man to
', ay te FV S J ° r ndln S. not for the sport of the
money-making .health.” And he

Lar Harbors, by Hubbard Hutchinson (Putnam;
Robertson and Mullens). One member in every ten
°? . the American massed tour which recently
visited these shores threatened to write a book about
uswhen he got home. The volume under eonsidera-
1, “ J h « ** ult of a s, ™ lar round-the-world

the threatened works are as good as this one they

YOUR FORD
CAN HAVE THE SAME
FUEL FEED SYSTEM
AS OTHER CARS —and
should have it.
About 8 out of every 1 0 cars you see on the road are
equipped with the Stewart vacuum fuel feed system.
The majority of the world s car-builders have long
since adopted the system as standard equipment, and
to-day this patented method of supplying petrol to the
carburettor is to be found on most of the lower-priced as
well as on the more expensive cars.
The reasons for the universal adoption by car-builders of the vacuum
feed system are its efficiency, its reliability, its economy and its safety.
The vacuum feed is not standard equipment on the Ford, but it is beyond
all doubt that “Lizzie” is a better car when fitted with it. On the steepest
grades and over the roughest roads this simple and wonderfully reliable feed
system maintains an even flow of petrol to the carburettor, for the fuel is
automatically delivered to the latter by the action of the motor’s pistons.
It is a simple matter to install the vacuum feed system
on the Ford—the job can be done at any garage. Once
installed you can be sure of freedom from feed troubles,
and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that your
hord lias the best feed system—the one adopted by over
90 per cent, of car-builders throughout the world.

Macquarie Place.
White moonlight filters through the trees
And sprays the under-dark
That spreads its shadows here and there
About this little park.
Save now and then, when some high clock
The hour, dull booming, tells,
On gleaming lawn and shining path
A haunted silence dwells.
Here lit, there shadowed, ’neatli high walls,
The pavements stretch unpaced,
Where hours ago a human tide
Moved to and fro in haste.
A human tide. ~ . ! Another tide,
With waters sweet and clear
Awash on shining rocks and sands,
Long, long ago flowed here.
Here leapt the mullet in the sun,
And here, a-quest for food,
Stone-still, with fishing spear a-poise,
The primal black man stood.
Here, mirrored iri deep pools, tall trees
Stood brooding, leaf and limb,
In sunset hours long with the past,
Or noons by time made dim.
And here, anon, came folk who dared
Sea-travail and sea-risk —
Their story yonder Anchor tells,
And yonder Obelisk.
To him who seeks this little park
At silent, moonlit whiles,
They tell of red coats glimpsed of old
In sunlit forest aisles.
To him who cares to sit and muse
At night, beneath their spell,
Of rugged men and toiling men.
And tireless men they tell.
They tell of vanished sunset tints
That colored timbered heights,
When bugles lowered masthead flags,
And raised white riding lights.
To him who hither comes to dream
They speak, when silence reigns,
Of Captains and of Governors,
And convicts clanking chains.
Beside still streets that silent lie—
Streets bright by day, and brisk—
Yon Anchor in the moonlight shines,
And yonder Obelisk.
High clocks above the city send
Their message far and wide;
Gone is the sea-tide that flowed here....
And gone another tide!

RODERIC QUINN.
If I Could Always Be.
Son of my heart, I wonder what you see
Whose wide eyes, though your arm caresses
me,
Arc fixed beyond, on long futurity.
See you bright streets and hurrying throngs
pass by,
White, flying ships limned clear against the
sky,
Warm waves of life that flow so far, so high?
Music and song you hear; and then again
A discord or a sigh—a sound of pain—
As after sunshine comes the wind and rain.
Oh, could I always be, that you might find,
Whate’er the future holds, my love to bind
Your wounds and cast your sins and griefs
behind
The shelter of my heart! If anywhere
You cried for help and only found despair,
The home that is my arms would seek you
there!
Ah then, ah then I’d love you without fear
Of the dim future —when I’m dead, my dear!
QUEEN STAND.
BLACK BONNET.
Storm.
From the black turmoil of sullen cloud
Keener and keener strikes the rain.
The little river laments aloud,
Shrill with unutterable pain;
Sliding and springing in white distress,
It rushes in headlong helplessness.
Leaves torn alive from the beaten trees
Spin and writhe and are whirled away.
The raindrops sting like angry bees ;
Sharp night worries the dying day;
A cruel wind is blowing,
The stream cries out till its blind despair
Shrieks in words on the shuddering air:
“Help me, help me! I cannot stay!
And where am I going?”
The boughs are battered with stony hail;
A bird drops limp to the sodden ground.
From the grim heaven, though all earth wail,
Is never a moment of mercy found.
The stream leaps wilder with sobbing breath,
A free thing fettered and lashed to death.
I come to the house no longer home,
To faces grouped where the hearth is bright.
They smile and chatter; my thoughts must
roam
To a grave far out in the bitter night
And the cruel wind blowing.
New nights, new days; but she is gone.
The nights, the days, the years drive on ;
My heart is frozen and fierce with fright—
Where am 1 going?
VICTORIA.

THE TOREADOR.
“There is every indication that the annual conference of the Australian Labor party will be stormy. The opposing four distinct groups are strenuously organising.
The position of the Premier (Mr. Lang), as far as the conference is concerned, depends largely upon the progress which he makes in regard to the abolition of the Upper House.”
THE TOREADOR (Mussolangi): “Grateful for all the entertainments I have given them, I don’t think! If I fail they will stone me from the ring."

BLACK SUNDAY.
January, 1851, was a hot, dry mouth in
Victoria. The whole State was parched and
brown. The grass of the plains, the thick
undergrowth of the bush which in those days
reached right into Melbourne, even the ever-
green of the gums, was desiccated into
tinder. February brought no relief, and the
morning of the 6tli dawned extraordinarily
still and oppressive. Then in the north a
furnace door opened and a wind blew across
the country until it had the strength of a
hurricane and the touch of a flame. Almost
in an instant the air seemed to be on fire.
An enormous wall of flame, preceded by
rolling clouds of smoke, bore down on the
coast. Incandescent globes of fire were seen
to roll before it, setting alight everything
they touched. Station homesteads, villages,
stock and settlers were swallowed up, and
the roads and tracks, where they were not
blocked by fallen trees, were thronged with
fugitives, human and animal. Showers of
cinders littered the streets of Melbourne, and
even fell on the decks of ships at sea, and
those frightened souls who believed the last
trump had sounded had justification for
their faith. So enprmous was the conflagra-
tion that it wrought its own destruction,
for the heat created a vacuum in the air,
and by next morning a southerly wind was
blowing in; so the flames, having nothing to
feed on in their retreat, starved and died.
The day went into history as Black Thurs-
day, and the people who lived through it
believed it was printed for ever on their
memories.
.** * *
Last week, three-quarters of a century
afterwards, Victoria staged another drama
of the same kind which was only prevented
from being of the same degree by meteoro-
logical accident. The same dry weather
culminated in a fierce northerly gale that rose
to nearly 50 miles an hour. Fires which
had probably been burning more or less
innocuously for days leaped up in scores of
centres and swept across the country along
frontages of from 10 to 30 miles. Whole
townships were wiped out, mills destroyed,
and more than 30 people burned to death.
Hundreds of volunteers fought the flames,
and some of them perished in them. A whole
camp of timber-millers, their wives and
families, were immolated, and a father and
mother had to watch from a shallow water-
race, where they were sheltering with some
of their children, one of their babies burned
to death before their eyes.
* # « •
The principal causes of these fires, which
regularly break out when conditions are
auspicious in so many places, are well known
and talked about wherever country people
congregate. At least 90 per cent, of the
fires, those who are in a position to know
assert, are lit deliberately. One object of
the casual incendiary is to improve the
herbage for his stock, and another is to
drive out of the bush grazing cattle which it
would otherwise be difficult to find. Most
of these acts, which should be classed by
the State as criminal, occur on Crown lands
and forest reservations from which the Lands
Department gets a trumpery revenue from
lessees. The rent obtained probably covers
a thousandth part of the annual loss in.
destruction of State timber. Towards the
close of 1925 the tired Parliament of the
State discussed this very problem. Although
in the city of Melbourne an elaborate organ-
isation exists for suppressing outbreaks in
the back-premises of Dago restaurants, it
was confessed that no system worthy of the
name was ready to deal with conflagrations
in the country. The State in that respect is
as helpless as a baby left in its cradle by
parents who have gone off to the pictures.
The State has a Forestry Department which
controls vast areas of bushland and is asking
for powers to acquire more; yet the Minister
in charge of it made a panic-stricken con-
fession, after the event, that the staff at his
command was nowhere near sufficient to
police the existing area, to burn fire-breaks
or man the fire-fighting machinery it hasn’t
got. It also needed look-out towers to scan
the wide horizon, and telephones to spread the
alarm. In fact, it was mainly occupied in
planting at great expense fresh inflammable
material for future fires to burn down. The
debate on the subject was talked to a lame
conclusion in last year’s Parliament because
the Government was in a hurry to save its
bacon for another six months by getting
into recess, and it was only after public
agitation that it was recently induced to
appoint to the Forest Commission a man
skilled in the business. When these weary
legislators reassemble after their holiday.
Black Sunday should be remembered against
them.
POLITICIANS AND PUBLIC
SERVANTS.
The Commonwealth Public Service Commis-
sioners are out of favor with the young lions
of Federal Labor. They offended these
stalwarts in the first instance by remarking
on the excessive amount of sickness among
Federal public servants, especially in Vic-
toria, where the percentage of absences in
1922-23 was 76.5, although it was only 51.8
in Westralia. Following on the Commis-
sioners’ comments the number of Common-
wealth officers who took cumulative sick
leave, which does not include single-day
absences to the number of three p.a., shrank
from 16,029 out of 25,375 employed (63.1
p.e.) to 9549 out of 26,132 (36.5 p.c.), and
the total absences in days from 218.317, for
which the absentees were paid £132,307, to
143,036, which cost the country £100,593.
As regards ladies in the Postmaster-General’s
Department, sick-leave cases dwindled from
2091 out of 2583 employed (81 p.c.) to 1346
out of 2832 (47 p.c.). But instead of being-
grateful to the Commissionei-s for the curative
effect of their remarks, which have had re-
sults that could not have been compassed
by medicine, the Labor politicians aforesaid
remain morosely hostile, and never miss an
opportunity of showing it. In their second
annual report (they have produced only two)
the Commissioners referred with “regret and
apprehension” to “the partisan attitude
adopted by the leaders of a number of
public-service organisations in connection
with the recent Commonwealth general elec-
tion.” They point out that “departments
were canvassed for contributions towards a
political fund, in addition to general propa-
ganda work.” Further, “the majority of the
organisations joined in demands for conces-
sions which could only be construed into a
price for political support, notwithstanding
the letter and spirit of regulations which
discountenance the exercise of political in-
fluence for the purpose of material advan-
tage.” These paragraphs have produced an-
other explosion of wrath in “advanced”
Labor circles, and it will go hard with the
authors if “advanced” Labor ever attains
office, especially as two of them • Brude-
nell White and McGlinn —served with
distinction in the A.I.F.
• * • •
The only logical objection to the Com-
missioners’ protest against the Common-
wealth departments being debauched by party
politicians is that its terms are too mild.
In the overwhelming triumph of the Bruce-
Page Government the sordid manoeuvres
which had for their object the sale of the
Commonwealth service vote to the Labor
party were in danger of being forgotten, but
forgotten they should not be. It is nothing
new for a party to bargain with Government
employees for their votes, but on this occa-
sion the bargainers showed an effrontery
which is usually masked. Labor politicians
actually conferred with representatives of
Commonwealth service unions to fix
the price that the people should pay for
the goods, and arrange for delivery. And
no secret was made of a letter in which
certain N.S.W. employees in the Post and
Telegraph Department were commanded by
their union secretary to go among their
fellow-workers and “collect as much money
as possible in support of the Labor party.'"
the assurance being given that “whatever self-
denial is practised in the way of sub-
stantial donations will be amply repaid.”
The union secretary did not mention
what would happen to members who
refused to practise “self-denial,” but as the
Lang Government was then waging war on
Government railwaymen who did not take
part in the 1917 strike or belong to a Red
union, the gentleman couldn’t have thought
it necessary. N.S.W. public servants were
also asked to help the Federal Labor party,
as they had helped the State Labor party six
months before, and hundreds came forward,
particularly Government school-teachers.
There are so many Labor politicians among
the N.S.W. Government school-teachers that-
it grows doubtful, in some districts at least,
whether they are paid for being school-
teachers or Labor politicians. In one notori-
ous instance Government school-teachers
were among the loudest champions of a hard-
pressed Federal Labor member in whose in-
terest irreconcilable (or unreconciled) Ger-
mans whipped up the considerable German
vote, an incident. which has left very bitter
feelings behind, particularly among parents
whose children receive instruction from the
aforesaid teachers. That particular member
scraped back, but many of his companions
fell by the wayside. Whether because the
Government-employee vote is not so import-
ant at Federal as at State elections, or
because the unsympathetic attitude of some
Federal and State organisations prevented
the goods being delivered, the Federal Labor
party was ignominiously defeated, whereas
the State Labor party had the great good
luck to win one more than half the Assem-
bly seats with 17,000 less than half the effec-
tive votes.
* * * #
During the N.S.W. State election cam-
paign a Labor newspaper boasted that its
party had the civil servants in the bag,
although it didn’t use those precise words.
The boast was recalled last week when the
N.S.W. Public Service Association held its
annual conference and the president, after
reminding delegates (jocularly perhaps) that
the association’s motto was “To Serve the
State,” and asserting that it had “never en-
gaged in political action unless there were
reforms to be won or wrongs to be righted,”
went on in this strain :
That the Civil Service can sink its internal differ-
ences and become a weighty factor in the political
life of the country are facts which cannot now be
disputed. To those whose shortsightedness com-
pelled concerted and vigorous action some 12 months
ago, I simply say “Behold your handiwork.”
Lang’s Attorney-General, McTiernan, was
present as a witness to the fruits or first-fruits
of the “concerted and vigorous action.” Accord-
ing to his account, the civil servants had been
given or were getting preference to unionists,
industrial arbitration on the required plan,
basic-wage increases in cases where “mem-
bers of the service had been prevented from
receiving them through their not having
passed the grade test,” and princely subven-
tions for the Superannuation Fund, the
Government having weighed in last year with
£600,000. (During the same period 18,222
employees contributed £256.028.) But the
Government was peremptorily informed that
it would have to go further. The abolition of
Saturday work was demanded, among other
things. A country delegate vainly pointed
out that Saturday was the farmer’s day for
transacting business in town, and that the
closing of the Government offices would not
be tolerated. Another delegate, also from the
country, bluntly declared that the Public
Service worked only oot hours a week (ex-
cluding, of course, public holidays, sick
leave, annual leave and lqng leave), and owed
its employers some consideration. “We
should be careful,” he said, “lest we lose the
support of the moderate element of the com-
munity which, after all, rules the country.”
It is a very pertinent warning, for “the
moderate element of the community” is by
no means defenceless against profligate agree-
ments between socialist parties and bodies
of Government employees, and their costly
and demoralising consequences. If the
necessity arises it can protect itself by
separating Government employees from the
general body of electors and giving them
members of their own, instead of continuing
a system under which their power is out of
all nroportion to their numbers. Were this
expedient adopted the Government em-
ployees would have six members in N. S.
Wales and five or six in Queensland, and
with elective Ministries there would be no
danger of such members selling their support
to the highest bidder. Again, the segrega-
tion of the Government-employee vote would
put an end to the ancient swindle of send-
ing bands of Government laborers into doubt-
ful electorates, and to the modern savagery
of compelling public servants to pay tribute
to organisations affiliated with the Labor
party or, it may be, the Third Internation-
ale. In this and other ways direct represen-
tation and honest advocacy of their interests
would do a lot more for capable and industri-
ous members of the service than will be
done for them in the long run by putrid pre-
election arrangements with politicians whom
they must despise.
“DAMNED NIGGERS.”
“Are you going to be one who believes in the
‘danmed nigger’ doctrine, or one who will stand
unselfishly for the brotherhood of mankind? One
result of the war is that white prestige has gone
down with a slump. There is no longer an assumption
that the whites must inevitably lead. The blacks
are increasing more rapidly than any others. The
whites are lowest in point of increase. We have,
therefore, an increasing problem of races.”— The
Bishop of Peterborough (England).
Dear Bulletin, —Bishops are not up
against nigger competition to any appreci-
able extent—in Great Britain, anyhow—so
they can afford to be selfish in these matters.
And in the course of their selfishness they
strike a lofty moral and spirtual pose, which
they probably expect to have put to their
credit in the Book which is alleged to lie on
the Desk Above. In other words, they gain
credit in Heaven by encouraging inferior races
to undersell their fellow men on earth. Read-
ing the term “nigger” in its widest sense, it
includes peoples like the Turk who are
bleached outside but remain black within, so
it takes in Asia in general as well as other
places—reyen western Asia, which, thanks to
the invasion of a Tartar horde, is less white
and less European than it was some millen-
niums ago. The creed of the British bishop
came originally from those parts, in theory
at least, and the creed is his bread and
butter, likewise his dignity, his gaiters and
his palace and his pastoral crook; so he finds
it difficult to be as white and as European
as he might possibly like to be. And nigger-
dom even more definitely takes in Africa,
concerning which place, or the southern end
of it, “Dek Jong,” most likely a bishop in
disguise, wrote a mournful piece in The
Bulletin (11/2/’26). The third Prime
Minister of the Union, who is also the third
Boer Prime Minister of the Union, and liis
party, and the Laborites who support him
on a number of points, propose to shut out
the colored races from skilled trades and
from professions, the imported Hindu being
classed in this matter with the local Kaffir.
This is a development of the policy which
confines Parliamentary membership to per-
sons of European descent. The Australian,
being almost as little troubled with “nigger"
competition as an English bishop, can afford
to take a lofty view of the Boer proposition,
and “Dee Jong” does so. He reckons that
if the bill becomes law there is in front “that
most terrible of all social upheavals, a slave
rebellion,” and a possible end to “the civilisa-
tion of half a continent.” The local people
probably realise that the present civilisation
will go in any case unless a stop is put to
the manufacture of inferior colored artisans
and professionals to oust the better quality
white man by sheer cheapness, and that
white civilisation had best put up a fight at
its own time.
* * # *
A programme for the systematic and
philanthropic uplift of an average colored
race will probably work out like this. A
certain proportion of said colored race
will be trained and educated to the same level
as a certain proportion of an intelligent
white people. Being up, it will remain up so
long as the white philanthropist holds it up.
If by cheapness and a patient shoving duality
it pushes out the white man, as it threatens
to do in India, its civilisation may stay for
a while where the white man left it; but, the
average “nigger” not being inventive, the
whitewashed specimen of the breed won’t
advance, and won’t add to the sum of human
knowledge. Then he will proceed to revert,
or slide downward. The almost indecent
haste of the Egyptian to revert, especially
in a political sense, when his country attained
to what it took for independence was a case
in point. The oft-told tale the phenomenal
inherent capacity of the “nigger” (black Out-
side like the Soudanese or only black inside
like the Turk) for increase is to a great
extent blather; and even if it wasn’t blather,
increase is not necessarily a virtue. In a
number of cases there certainly has been a
phenomenal and embarrassing multiplication
of inhabitants since the white man, or
Christian ass, began to make a sanitary fuss
over his inferior relative; but that is an
artificial business. India and Javav are
familiar instances. On the other hand, no-
body expects a Turkish city to be any larger
than when the Turk first stole it centuries
ago, though it may be dirtier and smaller,
and much the same stagnation or retrogres-
sion appears to have been the lot of Arabia,
of Egypt and of Africa generally when left
to themselves.
* * * *
Much is said about the sin of. steal-
ing the “nigger’s” country from him by
white aggression, but the race -which
was found there had generally stolen
the country from previous “niggers.
The white conquest very often left the in-
jured heathen his farm, and often gave him
increased security of tenure, and it almost
always gave him as much self-government
as he had before —which was none. If he
is shut out of Parliament and the learned
professions, according to the South African
idea, it is due to the white man that there
is any Parliament or any learned professions
bar wizardry. The exclusion policy may lead,
according to “Deb Jong,” to a slave rebel-
lion, though as nobody apparently proposes
to enslave anybody a slave war seems un-
likely. It is simple hysteria.
* * * *
There exists a theory that the white man
has a divine mission to nurse, and recon-
struct the heathen, “half devil and half
child,” though such material seems better
buried to make room for something more
promising. He is told to lift up the white
man’s burden, and to keep it up, when it
would be much wiser policy to drop it on
the black man’s toe, where it might do
some good and teach a lesson. He is
supposed to improve on the work of Peovi-
dence. To which it may be demurred that
the New Testament doesn’t inculcate anything
beyond preaching the gospel to the heathen,
and the Old Testament doesn’t even do that.
It rather instructs that the heathen should
be killed off, presumably that he may not be
the father and mother of more heathen. In
other words, a feeble new sect was instruc-
ted to make converts, if possible, so that it
might gain power, but a strong old sect
received no instructions to meddle plnian-
thropically with anybody. Judging by some
results a suspicion is justified that stronger
measures should be taken with the heathen
some of him, anyhow. The Unspeakable Turk,
for example, has done more for some cen-
turies to put back the clock of progress
than any other single race, and the rehgioi
which he represents is an aggressive, .back-
ward, intolerant nuisance. The Turk, is still
at it. Nobody expects that Abdul will ever
be, at heart, anything better than the swim
he is, though he may try to be worse, a
nobody expects that he will even put on a
surface pretence of improvement
response to rigorous and permanent unkind
ness. A healthy method might he for
Christian or Holy Alliance to drop 50 tons


of explosives, without notice, on Angora city
when the Ottoman Parliament is sitting, the
same as they were dropped on Sodom and
Gomorrah. If there was a shindy it would
at least take place while the Christian had
still a superiority in weapons, but probably
there would be no shindy—only a stunned
and respectful silence. It would be the sort
of firm treatment that the “damned nigger”
understands, and to which he generally re-
sponds. Brotherliood-of-man theories are
beyond the really damned nigger.—Yours

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Federal Money and State Grabs.
Sydney Telegraph (which has a new edi-
tor, by the way) appears to have adopted
the cause of the clique which is angling for
a Federal railway to serve purely State
interests in western N.S.W. and western
Queensland. The attitude taken up is that,
the Commonwealth being pledged for value
received to build a wholly different line,
through S.A. and its own property in the
Northern Territory, the presentation of a
sort of gratuitous transcontinental line to
eastern Australia would be better excused
and even justified if middle Australia was
simultaneously robbed of one. The view is,
in fact, that the meanness of the means jus-
f'fies the _ badness of the end. Lately the
D.T. published some vigorous headlines, such
as. ‘North-South Railway: Alice Springs
Line: Some Plain Truth,” and bemoaned the
partially-constructed central line in this
wise:—
The actuality may be judged by the experience of
the railway on which the extension will be tacked.
It runs from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta—477 miles.
191 l’ aS taken over by the Federal Government in
(A good deal of language here about the
barrenness of the S. Australian land.)
• Ihe capital cost of the line to the Commonwealth,
I “ c o ’Rm'o _ rolling stock, was approximately
£2,500,000.... Its percentage of working expenses
on revenue is always at least 150 per cent., and in
some years it has ranged as high as 190 per cent.
Its working expenses per average mile worked are
£373, the highest rate south of the Tropic of
Capricorn. Even the transcontinental East-West
railway'^confesses only to expenses on a similar basis
of £238.... Its goods and live-stock traffic has
declined steadily for the last four years.
The Bulletin doesn’t much mind what con-
clusions the D.T. comes to ; but this perver-
sion of facts, by which the public may be
drawn to wrong conclusions, is intolerable.
To begin with, the proportion of working ex-
penses to revenue on the unfinished southern
fragment of the South-to-North line isn’t
“always at least 150 per cent, and in some
years as high as 190 per cent.” During 12
years of Federal control (1913-24) the
expenses were five times below 150 per cent,
and only once did they reach 190 per cent.
The “goods and live-stock traffic” between
Port Augusta didn’t “decline steadily for the
last four years.” Goods and live stock repre-
sented £61,401 in 1920 and £54,27S in 1924,
On the East-West (Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie)
line, which is over twice the length and is a
completed affair which has worked out its
destiny, the goods and live-stock traffic sank
in value during the same period from £82,490
to a miserable £34,486, which was something
to discourse about. As to the assurance that
the working expenses of the S.A. bit of the
unfinished South-to-North railway are £378
“per average mile worked,” and that this
proves it to be a hopeless proposition, the
latest official figures are :
Morkino Expenses per Mile of Line Worked
N. S. Wales ~£1999 Westralia .. .. £640
Victoria . . •. 1995 Port Augusta-
S. Australia .. 1201 Oodnadatta .. 370
Queensland .. 837 East-West Railway 252
Tasmania .. 824 Australian average 1275
Federal Capital .. 662
As regards the barrenness of S. Australia a
good deal may be admitted. But even so the
State in proportion to area has seven
times more under crop than Queensland'
has; its percentage is almost twice the
Australian average, while Queensland’s is
below one-fourth of the average. Further,
the number of S. Australian acres under
crop for eacli 1000 inhabitants is the biggest
among the six States, while the number of
Queensland acres is the smallest. It is
notable that, some 30 years ago, Sydney
Telegraph, in conjunction with George
Reid, ran another clumsy, lying expedition
with little luck and less judgment. The re-
sult was that Sydney lost its chance of being
the Federal capital (the metropolis would
have come there by gravitation if the matter
had been loft alone). Now the aim is to sacri-
fice the development of the N. Territory, in
which N.S.W. has a large share, and the
method in view is to build a sort of desert
railway through a different desert to the one
specified in the agreement, and which will
also he an extension of a losing concern, but
not the concern agreed upon. The profit is
dubious, and thieving for the mere sake of
thieving is poor business.
♦
Proposed Absconding of a Big Debtor.
In his high-stepping but not very rapidly-
advancing progress, the N.S.W. Premier
announces new objectives at a great rate.
He spurns the dust in clouds, and though
he is less movable in a straight line than a
more practical animal might be, that may
be due to mere temporary obstacles. Also
he is great at striking lofty attitudes and
repudiating persons and things with scorn.
He has oceans of scorn. A recent outbreak
was a whole essay on the bounding attitude
which begging or borrowing persons are
liable to assume:—-
So far as the present Government was concerned,
it did not recognise the right of the Dominions
Department, or any other outside institution, to
interfere in the domestic affairs of this self-governing
State.... The Premier stated that he favored the
abolition of all State Parliaments, and extension of
the powers of local-governing bodies. The Government’s
decision to introduce the local-government adult
franchise, he said, was a step in that direction.
The position would have been stronger if
Lang had been in a position to repudiate
outside interference with “this self-govern-
ing State." N. S. Wales is certainly an
important item in a practically self-governing
Commonwealth, but the aloofness of a
hermit kingdom doesn’t quite comport with
such frequent and appealing appearances on
that sordid outside concern, the London
money market. Lang announces that the
proposed abolition of the whole State Par-
liament is not a mere perfunctory aspiration
or figure of speech, like the restoration of
Zion or the recall of the Stuarts to the
British throne. He says that his local-
government adult franchise is active prepar-
ation for a time when N.S.W. will be run
by a Federal Parliament (of one House, if
possible) afar off. and a swarm of little
Tammany councils close at hand. In other
words, he explains his purpose that the Gov-
ernment and Parliament, which own
£150,000,000 to people in Great Britain and
are constantly trying to owe much more,
should vanish, or disappear, or abscond, or
pack its bag and quit. The windy Premier
is thus the temporary head of a deeply in-
debted corporation, and when he proposes
to abolish it, or to dissolve it, into a flock
of little wild cats, without suggesting any
particular provision for its debts, he is
always liable to be interfered with. Credi-
tors think they have a right to interfere at
times, especially when the debtor never at-
tempts to pay.
The Queensland Parti-Colored Party.
The Queensland Labor party comes out of
the triennial convention bright red on one
side and pale pink on the other. In spite of
careful packing and the exclusion of .declared
Reds, the Government supporters at the
convention were at the mercy of chance
majorities. The expulsion of the Railway
Union delegates for refusing to sign the anti-
Communist pledge was carried by only four
votes (44 to 40). Had the seven excluded
delegates swallowed the pledge and remained,
the Left wing would have had a permanent
majority. As it was, a floating majority
swung sometimes to the right and at other
times to the left. The organised forces of
the Government carried the committees and
secured the appointment of a Parliamen-
tarian (George Pollock, Chairman of Com-
mittees) as president, but they were defeated
(46 to 42) in an attempt to whitewash the
Red objective. Then Premier McCormack
tried different tactics. He had himself and
two other Ministers (they formed the
majority) appointed to a committee to re-
vise the “methods” of the party. They re-
vised to such purpose that the “Supreme Eco-
nomic Council” and the rest of the Bol-
shevik dope disappeared, and nothing re-
mained but a string of mild, innocuous
“methods” which would be equally suitable
for the Nationalist Association or a Y.M.C.A.
debating society. The “objective” remains
a flaming red, but the “methods” have been
toned down to a delicate pink. The expelled
industrialists, having been declared black,
add further variety to the Labor color
scheme. This parti-colored scheme ought to
please everybody. In staunch Labor elec-
torates the Rod objective can be flaunted
amidst the singing of “The Red Flag” and
cheers for the Russian revolution; in doubt-
ful electorates the objective will bo discreetly
concealed, and the pale-pink “methods” will be
produced for public inspection and approba-
tion. Once elected, however, the Reds and
the Pinks will join in sharing the spoils of
victory. The parti-colored cloak —red on
one side and pink on the other —is merely
an election garment.
Crucifying the Small Capitalist
The Fair Rents (Amendment) Act of 1926,
one of the first assaults by the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment upon the provident “middle class,”
is now on the Statute Book. Government
stock, mortgages and a bit of house property
have been for almost as long as men and
women have taken thought of the morrow of
old age the staple investments into which their
bits of savings have gone. Now, so far as
their ventures in house uroperty and mort-
gages are concerned, they see a very dubious
prospect before them. As long as such legis-
lation aimed at profiteering by rapacious
landlords, it was right and proper; but the
legislation has gone far beyond this and cuts
at the just as well as the unjust, and with
a callous indifference for the well being of
thousands of provident folk neither profiteers
nor desirous of securing more than a fair
return on their savings. Whatever it may
be aimed at the law certainly hits hardest —
in fact, almost exclusively—the small capi-
talists. the working men and women whose
savings do not amount to any considerable
sum. The big men are left untouched. The
capitalist who can build houses to let at
three guineas a week or shops that will
command a weekly rental of over six pounds
are free from all its trammels. A sum of
money invested in two houses which bring
in a revenue of 50s. each is within this law:
an equal sum in one house returning a rent
of £5 a week is outside it. The one-house
man can put up bis rent or eject his tenant
as he thinks fit; the other dare not do so
without the consent of a Fair Rents Court
from whose judgment there is no appeal.
This position presents the extraordinary
paradox of a Labor Government which hits
at the small capitalist and lets the “fat man”
go. The answer proffered is that people who can
afford to pay high rents need no protection ;
but as this legislation stands it is equally
true that to give the desired protection to
the small tenant the interests of the small
capitalist have been ruthlessly sacrificed.
The control of his property has been taken
completely out of his hands. A correspon-
dent puts his typical ease. He recently, with
a small body of capital at his command,
purchased a pair of cottages “in a fearful
condition.” He expended nearly £4OO in
extensive renovations and modernisation. “I
live,” he says, “in my own cottage, which,
with the addition of this property, consti-
tutes all I possess in the wide world. I
am nearly 70, and figured that with the
income accruing from the property I should
just be able to exist in my declining years.
I am besieged with applicants desiring to
rent the property at a good rental, but under
the circumstances I dare not entertain
them.” Before he bought the cottages they
were let at 225. 6d„ and he is probably up
against the provision in the Act which makes
the fair rent that which it was, if these
cottages were then in existence, on January
I, 1915, unless circumstances render an
increase equitable; and of these circum-
stances and their equitability the Fair Rents
Court is to be the sole arbiter. No wonder
the old man is shaking in his shoes! The
economic results of this legislation appear
to be inevitable. What person with capital,
small or large, would under such precarious
circumstances, with so little control over his
own property, think of building cottages to
let at rentals of £3 and under per week?
Yet they are the class of houses that Labor’s
own supporters need as homes for their
families.
The Unlovely Old Age of Foreign-trade.
The lamp of Freetrade burns low in Great
Britain, and also gives off a bad smell. The
Liberal remnant in the Commons (38 or 39)
has the importing gospel still on its pro-
gramme and Lloyd George remains faithful,
or shouts that he does, possibly because he
would have very little programme left other-
wise, but some of his followers grow doubt-
ful. Little Wales, which provides seats for
two fallen Premiers. Lloyd George and
Ramsay’ Macdonald, returned 11 Freetrade
Liberals to the Commons till the other day,
when Alfred Mond went over to the Pro-
tectionists, so that for the moment it supplies
only 10. Ramsay Macdonald also swears
persistently by his habitual superstition, but
a number of Laborites admit that they are
full up of imported goods and closed fac-
tories. A majority of the Government party
is certainly, and a majority of both Houses
is almost certainly, inclined for straight-out
and whole-hog Protection, but the unlucky
promise which Prime Minister Baldwin
gave at the election of 1924, that he would
not do any fiscal whole-hogging without a
fresh appeal to the nation, is in the way.
So another election is prophesied for some
time this year. For a little while there was
report concerning signs of industrial im-
provement, but later news implies that the
report was a false alarm. The silk industry
is looking up because the Government
strained a point and taxed imported silk
heavily, partly on the ground that it was a
luxury and partly for the reason that more
revenue was badly needed, but other indus-
tries persistently look down, and the Gov-
ernment, as already mentioned, is shy about
straining points. Enough patchwork things
have been done in Great Britain, and enough
bonuses, aids, subsidies, credits and job-
providing devices have been resorted toi to
make the governmental method look like a
socialistic jumble. These devices include
especially the great original “dole,” and the
coal subsidy, which taxes the local citizen
in order to make exported coal cheap for the
benefit of his foreign competitor. It is
reckoned that £20,000,000 will be spent this
year in order to revive, if possible, the coal-
export business and provide cheap fuel for
foreign competitors. But nothing will do
permanent good while so much merchandise
is coming in that the British market has
little use for British merchandise, and so
long as Yankees and others can't be incited
to take any adequate quantity of goods in
return because the Cold Country has no
robust tariff to retaliate or negotiate with.
Internal wealth may be shifted about by
nationalisation and socialisation and confis-
cation, but if the internal -wealth is steadily
leaving, the end is the same. It is the case
of a farmer sitting at home and taking
medicine inwardly because, there are large
holes in his fence and strange dogs come
through and make away with his sheep.
Books of reference show small discrepancies
in their figures, but “Whitaker's Almanac,”
which is as reliable as any, estimates results
as follows for three peace years, during
which ,T. Bull and Brethren made heroic
efforts to reduce their war debt and found
the sources drying up. and the cable supplies
the final item :—-
The Balance.

1924- . . . . Surplus ' 3,659,000
1925- (9 months) Deficit 124,000,000
The deficit will probably be less when the
accounts close on March 31, but a deuce of
a shortage is looked for all the same, and
there is no reason to suppose that the dis-
astrous tendency of things will cease unless
the causes do. One obvious cause is that,
too much surplus of foreign merchandise is
coming in under a foolish fiscal system, that
too many factories are shut because foreigners
have got their trade, and that too many
people are living on their savings or on the
taxpayer instead of paying taxes. This is
how the harassed Old Man has been going
to leeward of late :
Surplus op Imports over Exports.

The position is that Patrick Taffy Mcßull
has to do without more, and more work and
wages, and pay other people wages for doing
more and more -work. Cranky or axe-grinding
theorists tell him that if he searches deeply
and earnestly he must be able to find a
remedy without, sacrificing the blessings of
Freetrade. lie tends more and more to re-
spond that he is tired of search which leads
to nothing, and is rapidly focussing on a
resolve to admit far less foreign goods, to
collect much more in duties on much less
goods, and to collect wages for making a lot
more goods himself.
Coroners’ “Courts.”
“Clement R. o’Uppe” : The system whereby
a coroner is empowered to commit, an
accused person for trial upon evidence adduced
at an inquest may save the time and expense
of a preliminary magisterial hearing, but
it is decidedly prejudicial to the accused.
Anyone with experience of coroners’ in-
quiries knows that they fairly bristle with
hearsay evidence and with statements,
assertions and accusations which have no pos-
sible chance of being admitted when the
ease comes before a Judge. One would
imagine that the Coroner’s sole function was
to arrive at the cause of death, to give his
verdict on that point only, and to make his
declaration without comment of any kind
regarding the prisoner in custody. Yet we
find him delivering a verdict such as this:
“I find that Mary Jane, deceased, was feloni-
ously and maliciously slain by Bob Hatchet
on or about so-and-so, and 1 order Bob
Hatchet to stand his trial for wilful murder
at the next Criminal Sessions.” That “verdict'
is oftentimes based on a mass of testimony
that is not evidence. So off goes poor old
Bob Hatchet to face a jury, after having
been virtually declared a murderer before
he has said a word in his defence. But that
is not the worst aspect of it. A certain
class of newspaper, which depends upon
sensationalism for its circulation, makes a
practice of giving full reports of inquests.
It is privileged to reproduce the whole of the
testimony, to take text from context if it
so desires, and to serve up, under suggestive
captions of its own designing, statements and
extracts from documents which, in all proba-
bility, will not be admitted as evidence when
the accused is put on his trial, and which, just
as probably, are only biased imaginings of
partisan origin. It is manifest that great
wrongs may thus be done to innocent per-
sons. These choice extracts from hearsay
evidence go forth unchallenged and uncon-
tradicted. They are read by the jurymen,
who at that juncture do not know that they
are to. be the accused’s judges. From them
an opinion, very often a totally erroneous
opinion, is formed as to the guilt or inno-
cence of the accused. He is, in a measure,
condemned without a trial. Some weeks
later the accused comes to trial before a
jury that already has him condemned. The
jurymen cannot possibly approach the case
with open minds, and, as they listen to the
evidence, shorn on this occasion of its for-
mer inadmissibilities, the impressions formed
a few weeks before must unconsciously sway
them to biased judgment. Two remedies
for the pernicious practice may be applied.
The Coroner’s powers may be limited to pro-
nouncing only the actual cause of death, the
preliminary hearing of the charge to be
taken in the usual manner before a magis-
trate ; or, in the alternative, the inquest
may. still take the form of a preliminary
magisterial hearing in strict accordance with
the Law of Evidence, the verdict to be only
in the nature of a declaration of a cause of
death and a simple committal for trial.

A Few Words to a Doctor.
“Old Bulletin Man” : Dr. Maloney,
M. for Melbourne, deserves a few re-
marks in addition to those made ii The
Bulletin of 18/2/’26. Discoursing on the
initiative, referendum and recall he said:—
At one time The Bulletin was a firm supporter of
these principles. Whether or not it has been influenced
bv the large advertisements which now appear in its
columns I cannot say, but it is no longer as staunch
a believer in the referendum, initiative and recall as
it w&s. The last Constitution evolved by the genius
of the British race, thanks to the sympathy of the
late King Edward and the support of the House of
Commons, namely the Constitution of Ireland, includes
the initiative and referendum. A bill providing for
the referendum and initiative has been passed by
the Tas. Leg. Assembly, and I hope that the Leg.
Council will have the good sense to adopt it. If if
does not, I hope that the Government of that State
will follow the example of Labor Governments in
Queensland and N. S. Wales, and abolish the House
of Fossils.
Perhaps I will make my case clearer if I
put my objections in catalogue form, the
same as is done with the exhibits at a cow
and bull show :
The Bulletin has persistently demanded refer-
endum on the selection of a Federal capital, on
the creation of new States, and on the abolition of
Upper Houses, and has urged its insertion in constitu-
tions generally. It specially urged that it should be
established, along with the initiative and recall, as a
substitute for the N.S.W. Second Chamber if the latter
is abolished. The party to which Dr. Maloney
belongs has never been helpful. I won’t suggest any
sordid motive for his adhesion to such a party.
The Commonwealth has had six Labor Governments
and has had a long run of Dr. Maloney, jet the
establishment of the Federal referendum, initiative
and recall, as working parts of the Constitution,
doesn’t come visibly nearer, and The Bulletin
remains almost a voice in the wilderness.
Large advertisements do not encourage opposition
to the initiative, referendum and recall. The whole
of the anti-referendum Labor caucuses of Queensland
and N.S.W. don’t supply one valuable advertisement
among the crowd.
There is no such thing as “the Constitution of Ire-
land,” though that of the Irish Free State is prob-
ably meant. It may have had the sympathy of
King Edward, but he had been 12 years in his
grave when the Constitution was drafted. I decline
to propound any ulterior motive for this flattery of
a deceased monarch. The Irish claim that they
drafted their Constitution themselves, in the Con-
stituent Assembly which met in September. 1922,
and that “the genius of the British race” had nothing
to do with the matter. Finally, the Irish Free State
Constitution isn't “the last.” That of Southern
Rhodesia came later. But the little doctor is in-
accurate by nature. It is not, therefore, necessary
to suggest that he was bribed to go wrong.
Dr. Maloney, M.H.R., expresses a. pious hope that
if the Tasmanian Second Chamber refuses to pass the
Referendum Bill, the Government “will follow the
example of Labor Governments in Queensland and
N. S. Whales and abolish the House of Fossils.”
If he further hopes that Tasmania’s Government will
follow the example of Queensland and N.S.W. Labor,
and drop the referendum principle down the sink, a=
as obstacle to absolutism, 1 don’t share his er>
thusiasm. If he also hopes that it will follow the
N.S.W. Labor example, and put nominees in the
nominally elective Chamber, my sympathies are nor
wide enough to follow him. Anyhow, it was absuro
for the doctor to speak of the N.S.W. Government
having abolished its “House of Fossils” (consisting
mostly of Labor appointees), for the concern was
still alive when he spoke, and making more noise
than ever in its life before. Also the Tasmanian Second
Chamber is an elective bodj 1 of sorts, which can’t be
knocked about without argument.
I make those few remarks because I hold
that if any gentleman of disordered hair
proposes to criticise my old paper he should
only do so when he has a basis to go upon.
Incidentally, I have an idea that the reason
why Dr. Maloney never held a portfolio,
despite his undoubted talents (including a
talent for mixed thought and statement), may
have been that he was liable to buzz round
about referendums and things of which his
time-serving Parliamentary mates have long
been tired.
Trying to Catch the ’Bus.
Vigor rather than diplomacy characterises
the present Government at Sydney, and it
might get on better if it combined the two.
The rush of the Premier at the ’bus and tram
question was a case in point. Comparing
1925 with 1.924, the gross earnings of the
N.S.W. tramways decreased from £.'>.683.916
to £3,619,272 —a decline of £14.644, or about
Bs. per cent. The net earnings, after paying
working expenses, fell from £542,385 to
£444,410—a drop of £97,975, or over £lB
per cent. There was only an extra mile of
line to work, but working costs and interest

rose in a remarkable fashion. Of course it
might cost Lang hi s job if he said that;
so he set down the trouble wholly to
the competition of motor-’buses, no re-
gard being even paid to the fact that
the multiplication of private motor-cars is
also to be taken into account. Lang's lirst
idea was to “resume” the motor-’bus services,
just as he proposed, in a previous political
incarnation, to resume all the big estates,
and pay for them in cheap long-term bonds.
Then he requested the 'bus proprietors to
furnish a report of the profits on each route,
but they refused on the plea that the idea
might be to take over the profitable services,
and leave the bad ones to the original owners.
Being thus foiled, like the villain in the melo-
drama, Premier Lang intimated that private
’bus licenses might be cancelled, and that the
Railway Commissioners might run a new
service. In his haste ho said that the 'bus
owners competed with the Government ser-
vices. and wore out the people’s roads, and
contributed not one penny towards the up-
keep of the same. In reply they said they
contributed a whole lot in licenses, rates, in-
come tax . and sundries. To get down to
details, this is the record for N.S.W., so far
as license fees are concerned :
Number of Revenue Increase
Motor Vehicles, from Licenses, of Revenue.
1922- . . 60,035 £258,010 —■
1923- . 81,693 352,037 £94,027
1924- . . 107,939 604,474 252,437
What the ’bus men say is that the increased
competition is largely that of private
vehicles (“tin-Lizzies” and the like), and
that it is absurd for Lang's Treasury to
gather in all that extra revenue and not
expect to lose a trifle somewhere as a
counterbalance. They add that if the ’bus
services were made a Government concern
and exempted from taxes, as Government
concerns always are, they might show returns
which would improve the tramway accounts,
and yet, from loss of these taxes, the revenue
might be worse off. If the N.S.W. tramways
are. losing money because of motor com-
petition. (though the Treasury appears to
be gaining, on the whole), a lot of people
are losing their lives, or being damaged,
through the Treasury selling licenses to in-
competent and dangerous fools in order that
they may compete with the tramways. This
is a feature which should be mentioned in
the official report; but it doesn’t appear.
Australia’s finances lately received a testi-
monial in London which was hardly so good
as it looked. The Daily Standard had been
saying things, and “underwriters of Dominion
loans,” so the cable put it, proceeded to give
this country a heartfelt boost in retort: —-
Australians should disregard the Standard's criti-
cism. New countries like Australia require a con-
stant stream of capital to finance developments.
As long as loans are translated into assets like
railways, docks and other necessary public works,
Australian credit will remain sound in the British
market.
“Underwriters of Dominion loans” are
simply middlemen who make a living by
procuring other people’s money for loan-
hungry communities. It isn’t such a bad
living, either. In one recent year (to June.
1922) N.S.W. paid £155,000 for “underwrit-
ing and brokerage” on a pair of loans. One
prominent member of the Dominion money-
supplying fraternity. Nivison, became a
he reditary nobleman in that same year. If the
Dominions had left off borrowing 25 years
ago he might (though, of course, he might
not) have become a small hereditary grocer
instead. Whether a man is agent for beer
or bonds, it is a rule to speak highly of his
commodity. No fortunes are made by hang-
ing out the sign, “Bad liquor sold here.”

All these items are detailed in the annual

ever perpetrate anything like it? My rela-
tion is not a Labor man ; his convictions are
all the other way: yet in order to keep his
job he has to acquiesce in this barefaced
extoi’tion. He still has the ballot as a means
of avenging himself, but the Labor panjan-
drums of Queensland are abolishing contin-
gent voting, and I suppose we shall have open
voting next.
“Light Horse” : Many members of the
Light Horse who served in Sinai and Pales-
tine would like to hear news of the much-
discussed memorial statue which was to be
erected in their honor on the banks of the
Suez Canal, at Port Said or El Kantara.
The A.L.11. themselves were in favor of the
second site, for it was there that the Second
Brigade crossed the canal on the road to
Romani, and began a trek that finished at
Damascus. A very large sum must have
been collected from the Light Horsemen
themselves, for the idea was mooted early
in 1917, yet nothing seems to have been
done in the way of reporting progress. Dr.
Granville Waddy, lately returned through
the Suez Canal, told the Sydney Millions
Club the other day that he had seen a fine
memorial to the Indian troops on its banks.
Since the Indian cavalry played no effective
part in the Sinai-Palestine campaign till
well towards its completion, the Australians
of the Light Horse and Camel Corps who
bore the brunt of clearing out the Turk from
the Sinai Peninsula, and were afterwards
the chief factor in his overthrow, may well
ask when the memorial of their services and
the sacrifice of their dead comrades is to be
consummated.
Unionist” : A point in trade-union law
was brought up for decision upon the appeal
of a member of the N. S. Wales Railway and
Tramway Officers’ Association for relief from
the payment of fees from July, 1921, when
he had sent in his resignation. At that
time the organisation had a case down for
hearing in the Industrial Court, and the
union contended that a resignation submitted
in such circumstances could not be considered,
according to its rules. Appellant maintained
that the particular rule in question was un-
reasonable, but the Court held that a provi-
THE FREE TRADE LAMB.
“King George was informed by the sole British typewriter exhibitor that the typewriters in Govern-
ment offices were of American make. Sir Philip Canliffe-Lister (President of the Board of Trade)
said he would have the matter investigated. The King pressed the point and exclaimed: It is scan-
dalous. I shall see that it is looked into immediately."
THE SHOWMAN : “That’s oar Freetrade pet, your Majesty. Isn’t it a beautiful lamb?”
HIS MAJESTY : “Lamb! Lamb! Why, man, are we all blind that you can pass that
thing off for a lamb?”
sion designed to maintain the funds of an
organisation when it was bearing the strain
of litigation was quite reasonable, and dis-
missed the appeal. Nearly every registered
union has a similar rule, and the Registrar
of Trades Unions, to whom all union rules
must be submitted, has never raised any
objection, as far as I know. The original
idea was not only to protect union funds, but
to save members from intimidation by em-
ployers who might demand their resignation
from a body taking a case to court. Nowa-
days the rule, interpreted harshly, might pre-
vent a member from ever having the oppor-
tunity to resign.
Hawthorn Bridge (Melb.) is to be closed.
This is the first decisive act in a long
record of muddle concerning a public utility
for which two councils were unfortunately
responsible. One collection of Bumbles said
the bridge was unsafe, and decided to close
its end. The other council said it could be
propped up or something, and left its end
open. The spectacle of a bridge which was
only half a bridge when looked at from
one side and no bridge at all when looked
at from the other struck even the coun-
cillors as humorous and they made a pilgrim-
age to the State Government. The Gov-
ernment, being urgently absent in Maori-
land or shooting ducks, suggested waiting.
Both legs of the thing are sinking visibly,
it will take at least two years to build a
substitute, if and when it is sanctioned, and
the heavy traffic will have to be diverted
on to already badly congested routes in the
meantime. The whole muddled business
supplies a fresh argument for the suppres-
sion of divided bumbledons in thickly popu-
lated areas.
“Country Ped.” : If the N.S.W. Education
Department is anxious to secure teachers
from other States it will have to discard
some of the red tape with which the transfer
process is festooned. I once thought I would
like to change over, and wrote for particu-
lars; when I found that I would have to be
examined by the Yic. Government medical
officer as agent for the N.S.W. department,
and would further have to put in six months
on probation and must start at the minimum
salary—well, I stayed in Victoria. Since
Victorian teachers must pass a stringent
medical test before being permanently
appointed, and (until this year) secure a
life-assurance policy, the N.S.W. order for
another examination seems farcical. The
probationary period is a sensible precaution,
but teachers of standing are not anxious to
start again at the minimum salary, even for
six months. Furthermore, qualification cer-
tificates of one State don’t seem to carry
over the border; if there were reciprocal
arrangements in regard to teachers’ qualifica-
tions transfers would be more common. Even
were they only temporary much good should
result. In Victoria w T e have exchange
teachers from England, Canada and M.L. in
our schools, while Vic. teachers are away fill-
ing their places. Occasionally a teacher
from Westralia secures an exchange; and
there seems to be no valid reason why this
system should not be operating through all
the States. If it is good for a teacher to
travel to Canada or England to secure other
experience, it is equally desirable for teachers
in the six States’ education departments to
exchange duties.

“Tiki Taptt” : The agitation for the tyre
tax in Maoriland (B. 7/1/26) came from the
rural communities, not the motoring organi-
sations. The deterioration of metal roads
through motor traction was becoming mani-
fest 10 years ago. Yet even in 1914 our
small county maintained its roads in
passable order for £9OOO per annum. In
1923 we had to allocate £15,666 —a steady
rise of £lOOO a year, due to the high-speed
automobiles and the heavyweight motor-
lorries. We were told there was no known
means of preventing the cost of the roads
falling on the farming community as county
ratepayers. Many counties let their roads
go the way of the wind, and the controversy
grew keener because most of the farmers
were motorists themselves and could appreci-
ate the benefit of a good surface under a
motor vehicle. The 1921 slump brought
matters to a head; our demands for less tax-
ation were too insistent to be disregarded,
and Government imposts eased off. But the
county taxes still increased; we couldn't
get rid of the incubus of road maintenance
for the benefit of tourists and stock-agents.
Coates, then Public Works Minister,
drafted a Motor Vehicle Bill, which included
a petrol tax. But Prime Minister Massey
visited the area of .Toe Ward, and the fisher-
men of Invercargill, where the motor-boats
consume a ease of petrol every few minutes
when a whale is sighted, got him to pro-
mise that there would be no petrol tax.
Coates, having made exhaustive inquiries
abroad on the respective merits of petrol
and tyre taxation, became incensed, and
threw up his road-surfacing schemes; Bol-
lard, a junior Minister, took charge and
imposed a tyre tax. Two years’ experience
has convinced even the farmers that a petrol
tax is sounder, and next session will prob-
ably see the change. The principle here as
elsewhere should be “Make the User Pay.”
Justice limps terribly in Queensland, and
even trivial cases are often spun out for
months. It was recently suggested to
Attorney-General Mull an that once a magis-
trate had started to hear a case he should
be reqilired to stick at it day after day until
the end. But the Minister replied that the
idea of daily sittings was “totally unwork
able.” Queensland hds cleared the J.P. off
the bench in all the big towns, and has
greatly enlarged the jurisdiction of the
magistrates’ courts, but for some reason or
other the Government will not appoint
enough police magistrates to handle the in-
creased volume of business.

Brisbane is fairly in the grip of dengue-
fever again, the present being the worst
visitation since the first recognised one in
1902. Medical experts are blaming our old
friend the “tiger” mosquito, whose second
name is “Fascista.” She (the boss* is inno-
cent) is the carrier of the yellow-fever
microbe, and in these days, when Central
America is within easy steaming, distance
of this country and hundreds of ships bound
to our ports use the Panama Canal, the Com-
monwealth Health Department carries a
heavy responsibility.

“Dr. Nil” : A while ago an anonymous
reformer elsewhere made the suggestion that
juvenile offenders should not be punished by
imprisonment, nor their parents fined, but
that the latter should be bound over to pre-
vent the delinquents from attending certain
(or any) public amusements for such periods
as the court might decide upon. Inspectors
of the same class as the women police could
be employed to see that this order was car-
ried out, and failure on the part of the
parents would render them subject to penalty
by fine or imprisonment. It would take
some of the “romance” (in the American
sense of the word) out of infantile crimin-
ality and be good for the children’s morals
and the parents' pockets. There are obvious
difficulties in the scheme, but there are ob-
vious possibilities, too.

“Gregqr” : One of the things which have
contributed to the prevalence of assaults by
natives on white women in the New Guinea
territories (B. 4/2/’26) is the ridiculous
regulation which debars native women from
being employed in domestic work in the
bungalows of Europeans. In consequence,
it is necessary to have “boys” instead, some
of whom have been raw bush-kanakas only
a few months before being recruited and
brought in to be given work at which they
cannot avoid coming into more or less close
and intimate contact w T ith white women. The
regulation in question was instituted at the
instance of the missions, whose object it is
difficult to discern.

“Stellsby” : Melbourne’s quaint cable-trams
doubtless had to go, but they w T ere at least
clean and comfortable conveyances which
crossed and recrossed Princes Bridge for
nearly 40 years without awakening appre-
hensions about the bridge’s safety. But
when the great 18-ton electric bogey cars
which now cross Princes Bridge in dozens
swell tenfold with the final linking up of the
major portion of the northern and southern
tramway systems with the St. Kilda-i’oad,
the question of what strain the bridge is
capable of standing will become a live one.
Waterloo Bridge, London, which never carried
a street railway, and probably shouldered
less traffic at one hit than Princes Bridge
does nowadays, has been condemned after
a century of service. Yet the Melbourne
structure, though nothing like as solid, is
expected to survive the assaults of phenom-
enal traffic until Kingdom Come. This is
madness. The vague Spencer-street bridge,
and, for that matter, the William-street
bridge, should both take definite shape with-
out delay.

POLITICAL
POINT
The Labor nominees in N.S.W. Upper
House were bound to see the point in time.
They were promised, if they abolished them-
selves, a free pass each for life, the title of
“hon.” and access to the library and refresh-
ment room—assuming that another Govern-
ment didn’t profit by their helplessness to
annul the whole wretched bargain, as it
almost certainly would. But they can get
all these benefits, and also retain their social
status as legislators, and reap any casual
advantages which attach to the legislative
job, by not abolishing themselves, and the
benefits will be practically assured, because
the beneficiaries won’t be helpless. So why
should they go as shams to the slaughter and
lay down their arms gratis, with infuriated
enemies about, and earn a reputation as
bribe-takers in the process?
The S. Aug. Parliament, in a special ses-
sion, has approved of the Bruce-Gunn
arrangement for the construction of the
Oodnadatta-Alice Springs railway, and also
of the Port Augusta-Redliill affair. In intro-
ducing the ratifying legislation, Attorney-
General Denny 1 paid a just tribute to Alfred
Deakin, but said he “did not concur” in the
suggestion that the Transcontinental should
be a standard-gauge line. “S. Aus. is for-
tunate in being able to have the line con-
structed on any gauge,” he added. Yet West-
ralia got 1051 miles of standard-gauge rail-
way without having any signed and sealed
agreement with the Commonwealth such as
S. Aus. was given when it handed over the
Northern Territory. If S. Aus. politicians
had been half as aggressive as the West-
ralians, instead of being excessively humble,
they might have got a 4ft. SMn. railway to
Darwin years ago, instead of having to wait
16 years for the commencement of a Bft. Gin.
section.
A good deal of stunted intelligence was dis-
played during the debate on the Crimes Bill.
There were the inevitable mock-heroics
about the sin of “penalising men because of
their opinions.” Bolsheviks still do that sort
of thing, and some unpleasant characters in
N.S.W. propose to put on the unemployable
list for life men w T ho are said to have dis-
approved of the 1917 strike. The attitude
of the Law is that a person may have strong
opinions in favor of drink, drugs, murder
and even unnatural sins, but if he isn’t found
practising these habits or teaching them
(especially teaching them to the young) his
views are sacred. It isn’t because a man
believes in cannibalism that he i? punished ;
it is when he begins to point publicly at
sdme young woman and smack his lips and
invite other people to get ready to try her
as a roast that the Law begins to think
something ought to be done.
The deportation clauses of the Crimes Bill
caused much bitterness among the Red Ob-
jectives in the House of Reps. Their pose
is that to send a non-Australian revolutionist
away at the public expense to see the world
is equal to disembowelment or worse. Charl-
ton demanded that no British subjects should
be liable to deportation for conspiracy to
destroy the national liberties, which would
mean that less than 1 per cent, of the
population would be amenable to the law,
and these mainly Asiatics. He also implored
that an outside person, convicted and liable
to imprisonment and deportation, should not
be sent away until he had been tried all
over again before a Judge and jury. Yet
when it is proposed to deport an Australian
out of his trades-union into the strange outer
world of blacklegism, contumely and beggary,
the fierce bigots of Charlton’s following
would scorn the idea of letting the poor
devil have an appeal even to the Small
Debts Court. Yet his offence may only be
that he allowed his employer to give him a
little extra money for extra-good work.
Opposition-leader Charlton, who made a
wretched showing over the Crimes Bill, tried
hard to make it prohibit, not planning or
attempting “the overthrow of the Constitu-
tion of the Commonwealth by revolution,”
but only “by violent revolution.” Then, of
course, the programme of every Red society
would attest that it aimed only at pacific
upheaval and harmless, kindly murder, and
this might safeguard it till the hour for
bloodshed struck. The House had no time
for Charlton. It declined to see how a
movement which took the power out of the
hands of the people’s Parliament and Gov-
ernment could be anything but violent.
SAFETY FIRST.
“Strenuous efforts are being made to induce the Vic. Allan-Peacock Government to come out of
its seven months’ recess and repair its sins of omission in a special session of Parliament."
THE TRAFFIC COPS: “Why take risks? Were quite comfortable ’ are , thank you.”
“Galleryman”: Previous N.R.W. Labor
Ministries contributed 20 p.c. of their salaries
over a cei’tain amount to party funds and
for the payment of honorary Ministers. The
Lang crowd, although it raised its salaries
sky-high early in the piece, is different. It
has only one honorary, Joe Coates, M.L.C.,
but doesn't hand him a bean, albeit he gave
up his billet to join the Ministry and saves
the salaried men much time and guineas in
attending openings, receptions and the like.
If a boss was sixpence short in Bill's dirt
money you could hear the same mob roaring
as far as Queensland, but in its treatment
of its own employee (as Coates is, in effect)
it shows its hand. This dog-meanness has
had not a little to do with the growth of a
mutinous spirit among Labor Leg. Coun-
cillors.
The Queensland Labor Government found
the Southport convention unhelpful as re-
gards the devising of new election baits.
Delegates had nothing fresh to suggest ex-
cept a silly scheme for starting Abrams
clinics all over the country. Premier McCor-
mack caught hopefully at another nebulous
proposal for child-endowment. He declared
himself strongly in favor of it. A few months
ago, when Gillies (then Premier) brought
A. B. Piddington up to Brisbane to draft
a scheme, McCormack was strongly opposed
to it. But the general election was not so
near then.
There has been another heated controversy
between Queensland Premier McCormack and
his Railwaymen’s LTnion opponents, Rymer
and Moroney, and one passage, at least, is
interesting. Rymer asserts that McCormack
confided to him and Moroney that he did not
expect to win the State election. In his dis-
tress McCormack has turned to his former
chief. Theodore, who has been offered £lOOO
p.a. and expenses to organise the campaign
for the Continuous crowd. The job will suit
Theodore if nothing better comes along from
the Commonwealth Government or the TJ.S.A.
It has been pretty well decided that be-
fore Vic. Parliament reassembles the Liberals
will force Peacock, Argyle, Eggleston,
Richardson, McGregor and McDonald to
either become the dominant partners in the
Cabinet (which would mean the Premiership
for Peacock) or resign so as to make way
for a new non-Labor Ministry. The Libs,
would not mind a Cocky Premier if he were
any sort of a leader, but Allan does not lead.
They will pointedly suggest to him when he
returns from Maoriland that, if the Com-
posite team is to continue, he should be
content with second place, just as Page
is in the Bruce Government. Lawson, who
has been out of office for nearly two years,
is regarded as the man in reserve. He is
keeping in training as president of the
National Federation.
During the final half of 1925 the Import-
ing disease got the Commonwealth down
again, just as it did in four out of the five
previous years. Exports should have been
about £16,000,000 more than imports to
cover the foreign interest bill. As they w T ere
£4.000.000 less the community added
£20,000,000 (or at the rate of £40,000,000
per year) to its own and Posterity's burdens.
Its own share of the trouble may be said to
serve the community right, but it is rough
on Posterity.
The N.S.W. Lang Government has been
assured by Harry Holland, leader of the
Maoriland Labor party, that its 44-hour-
week law is “a wonderful step in the march
of progress,” and that “it is much more import-
ant to reduce hours than to increase wages.”
He said this at a Sydney TOWII Hall meet-
ing, and no one tried to moderate his trans-
ports by mentioning that the good, kind
Government had, in effect, reduced wages.
Many workers are getting the same money
for 44 hours as for 48, but are finding that
it will buy less and less. Many others,
members of federated unions, are drawing
Ss. or 30s. less for 44 hours than they got
for 48. And whether a 44-hour State law
can over-ride a 48-hour-week Federal award
has still to be proved, with costs.
Some of the bright possibilities of munici-
pal employment in Sydney were hinted at
in a question asked of the Labor Lud Mayor.
An Opposition alderman wanted to know if
a newly-appointed Labor Leg. Councillor
who was—nominally, at any rate —an em-
ployee of the City Council, was being paid
out of the rates during his continued absence
from his civic job. The questioner alleged
that, while enjoying sick leave on full pay,
the invalid had been daily in attendance at
the Upper House which Lang hopes to
scuttle. The charge is to be “inquired into.”
Funds are being collected in the N.S.W.
Railway Department to entertain Labor-Pre-
mier Lang at a dinner and present him with
a gold watch in appreciation of his Govern-
ment’s policy of disrating Digger railway-
men and non-strikers in the interests of 1917
strikers. The watch will no doubt be em-
bellished with a miniature engraving of a
Hun submarine sinking a food-ship.
W est, M.H.R. for East Sydney, assumed
a vertical position last week and asked Bruce
if the Government would appoint him
(West, M.11.R.) a commission to proceed to
Lord Howe Island with a shorthand-writer
to inquire into the necessity or otherwise of
establishing wireless communication with the
mainland. Members greatly enjoyed the re-
quest for a free holiday at this salubrious
resort; but, after all, the proposal was no
more precipitous than the project of send-
ing a large party of members careering
about the Northern Territory in motor-cars
at Easter to study its “problems.”
The Federal Government proposes to sell
its nest of N. Territory hotels (four of
them) and go out of the business. A pub
with the owner over 2000 miles away is apt
to be untidy and unsatisfactory, the only
good point being that, being absent, the boss
can’t make a hog of himself with his own
liquor.
In the matter of expedition, the beam wire-
less project recalls a Labor Government un-
employed-relief work on the day-labor
principle. The Victorian station is expected
to be ready by the end of May, but a heavy
haze hangs over the English end. The British
post-office authorities, having refused the Aus-
tralian company permission to erect its own
station, are going so leisurely ahead witli
the one they propose to erect for themselves
that it is doubtful whether the thing will
be ready this year. John Bull has all
along shown a lack of affection for the new
method of communication. There is a stack
of English money invested in submarine
cables, which explains a lot. And Australia’s
lai •ge interest in the Pacific cable may explain
why the Commonwealth Government is not
displaying any vulgar indignation at John’s
tardiness.
The House of Lords lately showed us a
point. Probably it had noticed what a botch
local Courts make of such cases when matters
are left to their discretion; anyway, their
Lordships amended a bill to provide that
where the driver of a motor-car is convic-
ted of drunkenness whilst in control of a
vehicle his license as driver is automatically
shut off for 12 months. He may get it
revived after three months, but only upon
showing cause.
A London correspondent writes: —
.Tocook, beginning to rein-in after his five years on
the box-seat in the Strand, has an idea that Bruce
could profit by re-admitting him as an active stable
mate. He reckons the fogs of London haven’t, clouded
his mental horizon, and feels “Australia needs you”
surging through his bosom. All of which means that
a partly rejuvenated and wholly confident Cook is
preparing for a political resurrection in Australia
about the end of the year.
In N.S.W. Assembly Mr. Levy demanded
protection against “the nauseating eructations
of the obnoxious member Mr. Murphy,” and
compared him to a chimpanzee and a rhino-
ceros. Thereupon Mr. Arkins rose to pro-
test against these animals being mentioned
along with Mr. Murphy. Life is seldom
dull in the Ma State Parliament.
GEORGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At a banquet in America, novelist Rupert
Hughey said that United States school-books were all
astray in their hero-worship of George Washington,
who was a gambler and a champion curser, besides
being the leading bootlegger of his day. About this
time the banquet broke up, and everybody went
home.’’
Since first my elders tried to forge
A zeal for truth in me, and jawed
Of him, I somehow saw in George
A fraud.
He was too good to (in my view)
Be true.
Now, though the U.S.A. may boil
At traitors who the saint assail,
I welcome as the dinkum oil
This tale:
George was no Sandford ; what is more,
He swore!
My old resentment for the tosh x
My mentors forced on me is gone;
I greet with friendship gambler Wash-
ington,
Who revelled in his foaming pot,
The sot!
The smugness from his mem’ry cleared,
The greatness of his deeds remains.
What if he punted, swore and beered?
The chains
Of tyranny, the oppressors’ yoke,
He broke.
He left his country free and strong.
In these more drab, less spacious days,
’Twere well to those to sing a song
Of praise.
No wowser votes could strangle, then,
Great men.

The fire in the southern section of the Cen-
tral mine seems to have been drowned.
Although not much ore had been won from
the northern section during the period of these
accounts, the quantity broken has steadily
increased, and 1000 tons weekly is now being
mined. Operations at the Junction continued
uninterruptedly, 37,685 tons of greatly im-
proved grade being raised. That helped, of
course. But with skilled miners available
(high wages and splendid conditions have
made Broken Hill the Mecca of Australia’s
best miners) and a wonderfully profitable
metal market, the management is thinking
overtime on the problem of the sealed-off
area, where there is, say, 1J million tons of
ore.
The fire left an evil legacy. In its first
year (it started on July 10, 1923) it cost
the co. £187,123 in direct expenditure plus
the loss of excellent metal markets over most
of the term. Last financial year another
£125,403 was poured into the pit, and
throughout this period, too, lead and spelter
were at high prices. With the fire conquered
—“present conditions are now almost nor-
mal,” says g.-m. Courtney—the co. is
still unable to reap full advantage of a mar-
ket which is giving the other cos. along the
line enormous profits. Chiefly to keep the
Central plant and staff together the Junction
was bought, just after the fire broke out,
for £75,000. Then-manager Hebbard thought
it would be possible to win the rich ore in
the area affected by the old “creen’' and he
had in mind also the zinc tailings—con-
sidered valueless at the time —which had
been used for filling. Last year’s operations
prove that the purchase was well worth
while. Ore and zinc tails in the Junction
were estimated at half a million tons, but
the high-grade patch amounts to only
100,000 tons. The Junction ore. with 21,102
tons of slimes, was treated at the eo.’s mill,
21,729 tons of slimes and a small quantity
of crudes being sent to the B. H. Prop. mill.
At the present time the co. is treating all
the slimes itself. By June 30 last the stock
of slimes had dwindled to 67,683 tons. That
will see the current term out, and by the time
the last truckload is shifted the co. should
be on its feet again.
Production is increasing, but these figures
suggest the price that has been paid for tin*
lack of an effective fire-fighting service in
1923

The progress of the industrial side of the
company continued. Its fine ambition is
to build up a manufacturing business against
the time when the mine at Broken Hill is
exhausted. This is the year's record: —
At the Cockle Creek plant, production showed
material increase:—
Snip. Acid Superphosphates
(tons). (tons).
1920 .. 13,222 17,398
1921 . . 21,737 26,991
1922 . . 22,060 29,173
1923 .. 11,968 17,186
1924 .. 13,560 19,192
1925 .. 15,822 29,074
About half of the acid was sold, the rest used in
making superphosphates. Additional acid plant is
being installed. During the term a small plant
for making hydrochloric acid was completed, a
ready market being found for the output—77 tons.
Super, sales amounted to 30,000 tons. Demand is
increasing, and when capacity production (40,000
tons) is reached costs should fall.
The first unit of the cement plant is now at work,
and so good is the inquiry for the product that orders
have been given for the second unit. The Attunga
limestone quarry, besides supplying the cement-works,
is sending quantities to the Newcastle Steelworks.
Up to 1923 the co. did its own smelting and re-
fining at Cockle Creek. From that year, under an
arrangement with Associated Smelters, the lead con-
centrates went to Pirie. The co.’s experts are now
investigating the possibility of extracting the zinc
from the six to seven hundred thousand tons of slag
at the Creek, which average about 12 p.c. of zinc.
Nothing definite has resulted yet, but that dump will
be as good as a mine if the problem of low-treatment
costs and high recovery can be solved.
Zinc-distilling and sulphuric acid-making at Sea-
ton Carew (F.ng.) broke all records.
“Sundry creditors and credit balances,” in
at £513,590, hide reserves, unspecified, but
“ very substantial. ” Capital assets of
£1.161,987 include: Central and Junction
mines, £547,068; Cockle Creek works and
Attunga quarry, £353,801; Seaton works,
£261,118. Any over-valuation there is off-
set by the £448,086 of accumulated
profit which with the carry forward of
£6097 makes the nominal reserves of the
introductory table. The liquid position has
suffered because of the fire, but the im-
provement in earnings and the end of the
expensive fire-fighting free the way for the
co. to build up again. These figures illus-
trate the statement:—
1922. 1923. 1924. 1925.

Surplus .. £717,731 £835,648 £485,427 £392,797
When the report was presented in London,
six months of the present term had passed
and shareholders were informed that, given
freedom from interruptions, there was no
reason why working account for the year
should not show a profit “quite as large as
that of 1923.”
Capital is £1,050.000 in 600,000 fully
paid £1 profs., 10 p.c. non-cum. and partici-
pating with ordinaries in any higher rate:
and 600,000 ordinaries of 15s. each fully
paid. Prospects are bright. Cement output
for the current year has all been booked;
super, sales are increasing; 1000 tons a
w y eek is being raised from the section of the
mine now being worked; and metal prices
are holding at highly profitable levels. The
drought and failure of the B. H. water
supply will close the mines at the end of
this month, unless heavy rains fall mean-
time ; but that won’t interfere with the job
of reconditioning the Central mine, nor will
it affect the super, and cement works.

Though competition in ice and milk was
still keen, the co. did bigger business in both
lines. But the meat-export trade showed no
sign of re-animation, which means that the
co. is carrying a heavy dead-weight in the
cold-storage department, for a lot of capital
is tied up in refrigerating works. Other
departments, however, helped to bring in
enough to justify a small lift in the previous
slack year’s dividend. But even 7 p.c. isn’t
very impressive in these days of low money
values and high taxation. Reserves of
£64.000 were helping capital of £281,901
(some calls were got in early in the year) ;
net income amounted to 5.6 p.c. on the
total —Which shows that the Fresh Food
is no money-spinner until it can put much
of its plant to better use. Nor is there
any prospect of early improvement in the
frozen meat trade, and competition in ice
and milk is more likely to sharpen than
otherwise. The co. is meeting the problem
by installing new milk-handling plant and
machinery. These works, now nearing com-
pletion. are expected to cut costs. The
capital lately called up was absorbed in
the additions:—

And £14,000 of “Commonwealth stock, etc.,”
disappeared, partly in the same direction.
Trade debts increased, but the bank over-
draft was clipped by £7OOO-odd; and the
co. was carrying at the balancing date £4562
more of book debts and £3322 more in stocks
than at the end of the previous term. Still,
the position was quite comfortable, liquids
being well in excess of all outside liabilities.
The 44-hour law will hit the Fresh Food
in common with others in N. S. Wales, and
although the accounts give no details (net
profit, after unspecified amounts have been
written off for depreciation, etc., alone is
shown), margins are obviously narrow. Un-
til such time as the frozen-meat export trade
revives, the co. appears to have but little
chance of anything but moderate profits.
Which means that shareholders have but
little chance of anything but moderate divs.

The leanest 12 months for quite a while, but
still fat. enough to yield shareholders 15 p.c.
and leave a bit over. The 15 p.e. is good,
but there are features which are better.
Capital is only £60,000, wherefore it takes
only another £3OOO to add 5 p.c. to the div.
rate. And much even of the £60,000 is, in
a manner of speaking, home-made. Original
capital was £30,000, but a total of £60,000
of reserves was capitalised, and in 1924
£30,000 of capital was returned. That is the
past. In the present the co. holds £27,897
in cash and Government securities and in-
vestments, and a further £13,931 in other
assets more or less liquid. Allowing for the
£1738 of debts and the final div. (£4500),
shareholders could see on December 31
almost two-thirds of their capital lying
handy. Here is a comparison :
Dec., Dec., Dec., Dec.,
1913. 1923. 1924. 1925.
Liquid assets .. £23,424 £75,085 £40,804 £41,828
Liabilities . . . . 1,108 2,570 1,166 1,738
Surplus . . £22,316 £72,515 £39,638 £40,090
As fixed assets are in at only £37,040, de-
preciation appears to have been given ample
consideration. That, of course, is the vital
thing. There must be an end, some day,
to the coal available for extraction, though
in this case, as in some others, the end has
been pushed farther into the distance by the
purchase of new coal lands. The brickworks
are a secondary consideration. They cer-
tainly showed a return last year of 54 p.c.
(less, maybe, a portion of overhead) on the
heavily-written-down figure at which they
appeared in the books; but the real depen-
dance has to be upon coal sales. Expendi-
ture was kept in hand over the period. Pro-
viding the assumption as to the adequacy of
depreciation is well-based, prospects for a
continuance of the good divs. are as bright
as anything can be which is associated with
coal. The N.S.W. Railway Commissioners’
pit. the biggest on the field, has definitely
limited the market for Western mineral;
and quality is a second handicap in the
fight for markets. Still, the Lithgow Coal
Association is an efficient organisation ; re-
turns from other than coal are increasing;
and (after the final div.) each fully-paid
13s. 4d. share was represented by 7s. lid.
of more or less liquid assets. Those factors
impress the market, which has bought re-
cently at 245. 3d. It means that buyers are
looking at something more than the book-
value of the material assets visible on De-
cember 31, for these amounted to no more
than 16s. Id. per share.

The calorific standard permitted under
schedule 3 of the Gas Act was adopted
last year by this eo.. and the change enabled
it to reduce the price by 4d. per thousand
c. ft. as from March 15. Legislation is
proposed by the N.S.W. Government to
abolish the illuminating-power standard and
retain the calorific standard, allowing for a
reduction, however, to 450 B.T.U. gross com-
pared with the 500. B.T.U. net (KuSB
8.1. U. gross) provided in the present Act.
Hie change of standard suits the times. Gas
nowadays is used more for heating and
power than for illuminating; and even
where it is used for the latter purpose the
general adoption of the incandescent burner
has rendered a high illuminating power less
necessary than it used to be. It is the heat-
ing standard which therefore calls most
loudly now for regulation; and to that there
can be no valid objection. If the bill be-
comes law, Sydney cos. will be able to use
coal from near mines instead of being forced
to go far afield, as they now have to There
is a further aspect that needs attention As
matters stand, there is little inducement to
develop the by-product side of the business
particularly since, as the A.G.L. has found',
it is sometimes necessary to educate the
public to purchase a by-product. Manly has
actually gone back in the matter of residuals,
as is shown here:—

£49,367 £48,001 £47,909
The position is really less favorable than
it seems to be on the surface, for total pro-
duction of gas has increased over the period,
and so, of course, should that of residuals.
Nothing much will be done until the law
allows gas cos. to pay a bonus out of tne
extra profits won by the development of this
section —a development to be greatly desired
because of its assistance to other labor-
employing industries.
During the year the co. extended its mains
to Bro.okvale, Deewhy and Collaroy dis-
tricts, and service will shortly be available.
This marks the limit allowed the co. under
its private Act; but the Board is seeking
power to extend to Narrabeen. Extensions
chiefly mopped up the new capital obtained
in September. As the co.’s mains have
travelled, capital has had to be increased.

Despite keen competition and some
dumping from overseas, this co/s fine pro-
ducts held their trade last half-year. Chair-
man Charles Ludowici had a sharp word to
say, though, about the N.S.W. Government's
practice of giving preference to overseas
goods. Now that the N.S.W. Labor Govern-
ment has brought in the 44-hour week he
holds that at least an equivalent local Pro-
tection should be granted in the case of
Government contracts; and that opens up a
large question with which the Federal
authority will have to deal sooner or later.
Although business recovered in the second

The consistent maintenance of its full capacity is
one of the many recommendations that influence the
use of Pioneer Wood Pipe. When first installed it
will carry from 15 to 20 per cent, more fluid than
any metal pipe, and this flow will increase instead of
decrease as the years go by. The reason for this is
that the interior bore becomes smoother with the
friction of the constant flow. This smoothness pre-
vents the accumulation of organic growths or similar
obstructions, and rust is, of course, unknown. The

The Bulletin wonders how much longer
the forfeited-share swindle is to be allowed
to continue. Blocks of shares in down-and-
out mining cos. forfeited for non-payment of
calls are auctioned on ’iChange and passed
in without a bid. The directors and friends
wait their chance and secure an option on
a venture which is being boomed, or a block
on the same line as one which is being boosted.
Glowing reports of prospects, etc., somehow
get into print, and the public, fooled by
whisperers, rushes to buy. Then the afore-
said directors and friends take a hand. An
option at a nominal figure is obtained on
all forfeited scrip in the office safe; the
public, thanks to the whisperers and news-
paper puffs, are supplied at a handsome
profit and the option on the scrip is exer-
cised. By and bye the show is abandoned,
and preparations are made for engineering
a similar swindle somewhere else. A deputa-
tion proposes to have a word wi th the West-
ralian Minister for Mines on the subject.

Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) has been an-
nouncing values up to 60s. per ton over
widths of six feet. Last year Horseshoe
spread similar reports, after each of which
it approached the Government for a cash
advance just to carry it on until the rich
development could be opened up. These
advances now total about £40,000, and it
looks as though the State is expected to find
more.

Telfer North, an Adelaide-controlled pro-
position, has taken an option on a show in
the Macdonnell Ranges. Its first venture was
in the West, but that proving a dud it lias
since been waiting for something to turn up.
Mining of any sort in the heart of the con-
tinent would be costly, but expense is the last
thing thought of b,y cos. like Telfer North,
which have scarcely a feather to fly with.
* * * *
Local papers regretfully describe the
latest gold find in the West as practically
worthless. One states that what was be-
lieved to be the real thing was only mundic.
As a result the wild-catters who were early
on the scene and asked big considerations
for pegged bush are moving on.
* * * *
Empire Extended (W.A.) put some money
into its almost empty till by the sale of for-
feited shares —this time to Sydney. The
latter bought on the strength of favorable
reports concerning an option recently taken
by the co. on some far out-back mica
claims. Prospects are alleged to be good,
but so far nothing has been found to justify
the belief that prize packets have been
secured. As usual, cheerful reports will pro-
bably be followed by calls.
... * * * *
Freney Oil Co. (W.A.), which recently
acquired Okes-Duracli’s assets, has just
broadcasted another cheerful report. This
time indications at Poole Range are declared
to be “more definite” than elsewhere on the
eo.’s holdings, and, assisted by the subsidy
provisionally promised by the Federal Gov-
ernment, boring is expected to start there
some day. Something is also said about a
field survey of part of Okes-Durack area, as
“present exact, knowledge concerning it is
entirely too limited.” The half-yearly meet-
ing will be held shortly, and all won’t be
smooth sailing there.

H. I. Jensen has reported on the Ivoor-
boora and Gurrumbali properties of the
Queensland Tin Co., Herberton (N.Q.).
Already 10 head of stamps are crushing Ivoor-
boora ore, which seems almost a time-record
from flotation to production. Jensen says
that the Koorboora lodes are, in general,
large lenticular replacement bodies in
chloritic rock, but in the harder strata they
are smaller and richer. He sees a great re-
semblance between the Two Jacks and the
old Vulcan at Irvinebank, the richest tin-
mine ever worked in Australia. Still, he
admits that the pig-rooting of other years
makes prospecting costly now. A new shaft
should be sunk to the 200 ft. level, and this,
with dam and 10-head battery, will cost
£6OOO. At the Gurrumbali group at least
£BOOO will be needed to place production on
a right basis. In return for such expendi-
ture the next three years should crush
45,000 tons at 20s. a ton profit from the Two
Jacks and 50,000 tons yielding £30,000 at
Gurrumbah. The yields from the Tennyson
and Shakespeare leases should be “equally
large and profitable.” Estimates are all
based on present tin prices; but if, as Jensen
points out, the average grade ore is rein-
forced from time to time with bonanzas,
profits may be much above ordinary esti-
mates. A concurrent telegram from manager
F. G. Browni indicates that a “pocket” is
already in hand off the winze below the
250 ft. level in the Two Jacks.
Some of the old IXL crowd such as Henry
Jones and Alf Ashbolt, with Tom Lyons,
also of Hobart, are naying the expenses of
Willoughby C. Smith to try ground in
Nigeria (Africa) for them. Smith previ-
ously was with the Keffi Consolidated, which
is a good tin-getter, and he ought to know
the country. As the result of five months’
prospecting he has taken up eight square
miles of country—an area almost as big as
the Tongkah Harbor block. It is not a big
area as Nigerian concessions go, for some Lon-
don concerns have acquired blocks running up
to 50 square miles. Smith has found tin in
two small rivers and to get all the ground
worth prospecting into his hands he has
pegged out the likely-looking country near
bv. He writes of “a beautiful flat,” not of
course of the usual mining type, but with
possibilities which may furnish “something
big.” If he gets within coo-ee of the Tong-
kah Harbor he will have done well. If the
ground is not as good as he thinks, then he
has his eye upon another large block, but wall
not go for it until the drill has eaten into
the patch about which he is spread-eagling.
Another possibility is a little block of 50
acres at Zelau, where mining is going on in
31b. ground ; that, in Malaya, would spell a
boom.

George Dickenson’s Morning Star (Vic.)
is glimmering, and Alec Peacock is to be
asked to put up a bit of cash to help the
show along. What has galvanised things
has been the cutting of a make of quartz in
the east winze at No. 7 level where nine
inches of good stone is showing. As gold in
a diorite dyke is always worth following to
see if it widens out, there is an excuse tor
helping the co. Apart from that, diamond
drilling below 920 ft. has cut ore running up
to 20dwt. The ouartz was on the line of
the shaft; and as it will not cost a ton of
money to carry that -working down, the mine
is to be given another chance to justify all
that Dickenson had to say about it before
he went on his pilgrimage.
* * * *
Daylesford (Vic.) is amused at the price
to which Ajax shares have been run because
of a development met with a bit ago. rihares
would have the bears at ’em, but the last try
was fairly disastrous to those who attempted
to earn a crust by going short on scrip. The
co. put up a small credit last half-year,
which is a lot better than having to shell out
calls, as all the rest of the Daylesford group
have to do, without getting a flat make or a
run of formation on which to have a market
boost. With the tributors doing fairly well
at Ajax No. 5 level, inducement exists for
a prospecting programme at No. 4. It is
this work and the reputation of the mine
as a good div.-payer in the past, phis the
recommendation of geologist Baragwanath
to go on with prospecting, that keeps the
market pot boiling so well.
* * * •*
Of the old Bendigo brigade Hercules alone
goes aloug as a div. payer. Ore runs a shade
under 9dwt. and on that average, despite the
small quantity of 8500 tons treated, share-
holders get Is. 6d. for the six months’ work.
Driving north at 1620 ft. a good shoot of gold
was met; but it was short, and so the order
is to still go ahead to see if something more
promising can be got. A rise to the level
above kept in poor stuff almost all the way,
but stoping north and south off it has given
fair-grade stone for the battery. North at
1520 ft. the country has not provided any-
thing, the shoot opened up off the 715 ft.
north winze turning out a duffer. South at
1380 ft. results were equally poor, the best
stopes operated upon of late being at the
1440 ft. level. The mine has not much to
come and go upon at the moment.

North Blocks Co., the Broken Hill show
with headquarters at Adelaide, 12 months ago
issued 250 of its £1 shares for £5 each, appli-
cants being given an option over four shares
at the same price for each one taken up.
Half of the options had to be exercised in
August and half this month. The co. re-
ports that all shares were called for. The
latest sum follows the rest —in development
work.
* * * *
Mt. Patterson (N.S.W.) holders have
decided to increase the co.’s capital to
100,000 shares of ss. each by creating an-
other 20,000 contribs. When these have
been called up, actual subscribed capital will
be £21,125. The old 20-head battery from
Mt. Dudley which formerly came from Mt.
David has not yet reared its head on its
third mountain-top. although the effort has
covered two years. There is also a threatened
water shortage, despite the dams and wells
which over-ran the reports of P. S. Graham
when he was managing director. “So soon
as it can be managed” a trial crushing will
be put through with five head. This is some-
what different from the outbreak in the pros-
pectus of 24/11/’23, wherein 200 oz. a week
meant a revenue of £BOO and a net profit of
£520. Graham’s annual report of 10/10/’25
declared that “it would require 100 head to
make a decent impression on this hill.”
* * *
Having at long last reached the registra-
tion stage, Manna Hill, Stuart Town
(N.S.W.), should lose no time in putting a
hole into the rich dab which has remained
undisturbed during the 12 months flotation
period. If the dab proves a continuing shoot
it will not take lotig for the 40,000 paids
and the 40,000 contribs. to earn their ss.
Otherwise, of course, they will be holders in
a chance for which only pence will be on
offer.

Sutherland Lode, Kiandra (N.S.W.), is
suffering from water. Both pumps refused
duty about the same time, and the shaft
filled from 115 ft. to the surface. The Italian
miners were paid off, and the co.’s affairs
remain in a state of suspended animation.
It looks as though the small co. wrestling
with the property is not strong enough.
“Oil Slialer”: At a conference of scientists
and engineers interested in oil-shale held in
California, it was reported that three retort-
ing processes were profitably distilling oil
from shale. A list of 31 known processes
was tabled, but 28 of them seemed to be in
the laboratory stage. Since then the list
has been increased. At the Wembley Exhibi-
tion a low-temperature carbonisation retort
was in operation on Australian oil-shales
under the supervision of the inventor and
patentee, It. 11. Crozier, an Australian by
birth. A 10-ton working unit of the retort
was erected behind the Burma pavilion, pro-
bably because the Burma Oil Corporation had
then ordered a Crozier plant to treat 500
tons of oil-shale a day of continuous work-
ing, That plant should ere this be operating
in Burma. In most of the retorts so far
invented to treat our rich Australian shales
sufficient heat was not regularly conducted
to the centre of the mass of material under
treatment, and much of the stuff remained
cold or partly heated and clogged the retort.
This trouble has been overcome in the
Crozier retort by the introduction of inter-
nal flues, which conduct the heat from the
surrounding external flues direct to the
centre of the shale or coal under treatment.
Its chief advantages are low capital cost, low
working costs, simplicity of design and free-
dom from mechanical troubles.

Mandated Development Co. got flooded out
of No. 4 bore at 137 ft. and promptly flitted
to another site. No. 5 had reached a depth
of 32ft. when the last radio came along. The
tenor of the news from Matapau is boring—
particularly to the market.
* * * *
Rawang (F.M.S.) scrip was bucked to
325. on the January yield of 40 tons oxide
from 120,000 yards treated by the bucket
dredge and 10 tons saved by the electric
plant. Since the original float in 1920 this
56 tons is easily the best.
# * * *
Ratrut (F.M.S.) continues dredging in
poor ground. January saw 73,000 yards
treated for 94 tons, against 05,000 yards
for 10-1 tons in December and 76,000
yards for 14f tons in November. The Board
was never fully convinced about the values
in the new area, and in the end took it on
in preference to a sudden winding-up. The
quarterly div. of 6d., however, seems certain
to absent itself if this is the best of the
ground.
Burma Malay, a holding concern in 50,000
20s. shares, of which 25.000 are paid up,
remains the mystery stock in the vestibule
of Sydney Stock Exchange. The directors
are G. W. Osborne, late Alluvial Tin; E. N.
Mulligan, late of Austral Malay; and Russell
H. Crane. General deductions stamp the
show as a shingle off the roof of the house
of Pratteu. One broking firm has bulled
scrip to 60s. in a few weeks, evidently
secure in the knowledge that holders are
prepared to stand pat up to a certain figure.
Apparently vestibule dealing is content to
proceed on information meagre to the high-
est degree. If the stock were officially listed
the Stock Exchange committee would require
quite a lot of details.
* * * *
An advance circular by Austral Malay to
shareholders summarises the position of the
associated cos. at December 31, and fore-
casts 3s. a share for 1926 —not a princely
distribution for those who recently purchased
the 20s. shares at 565. In this respect the
balance-sheet will, presumably, reveal many
things the circular doesn’t. Kampong Co.
will treat ground above the average, and
should return Bs. to holders, in addition to
paying for transference of No. 1 dredge to
the new area at Karangan in Kedah
(F.M.S.). Asam Kumbang will also operate
in ground above the average, and should also
return Bs. Ulu Yam retired the balance of
its loan liabilities during the year, but there
sticks out an item of £5450 to be met in
replacement of the existing bucket band of
the dredge. “Temporary financial accommo-
dation will be necessary.” Low-grade, clayey
ground will be operated for the first quarter,
with better returns during the second half
of the year. Holders, how r ever, need not expect
more than 3s. in divs., as other heavy plant-
renewal items have to be faced. Thabawleik
has had so many setbacks in plant construc-
tion that “about the end of August” is now
scheduled as the starting-point of produc-
tion. usual under-estimates of engi-
neering difficulties are mirrored in the cir-
cular at this point. It means, too, that the
co. will start off heavily in debt, but the
directors have made financial arrangements.
Options have been taken over further areas,
on one of which a boring campaign has been
commenced, and hopes are entertained that
a payable area or areas will be found during
the year.

to follow. Their little township around
Wortley’s Hill, Powelltown, was an oasis in
heavy bush, its only bridge to the outside
world a narrow-gauge truck-line. Ten min-
utes after the first show of fire, the settle-
ment was surrounded and the whole popula-
tion started off along the railway. Beaten
back by the flames, one small party rushed
down a slope and buried itself in a tiny nool
five feet across and a few inches deep. Here
the father of a family saved his brood by
pouring water on them from his hat. All
except one, a baby which in the confusion
had been handed by the mother to a fire-
fighter. That morsel of humanity was never
seen again. Two more of the Tasmanians
found sanctuary in a creek and lived to tell
their tale in Melbourne Hospital. The re-
maining 13 were found in a charred circle
near the ruins of the mill.

“Gipps”: Add to the list of wonderful
escapes when the bush-fires roared through
Gippsland the 200 citizens of Gilderoy. They
found sanctuary in a concrete tunnel w r hich
had been recently driven through a hill to
avoid hauling over the mountain top. The
smoke blew through this tunnel as if it
were a factory chimney, but the whole crowd
came out alive. In the same district an old
man who had just arrived on a visit left
good shelter under a bridge and crawled into
an old boiler. He was roasted to death.
* * * *
“C.Q.”: One of the saddest discoveries of
the rescue parties that penetrated the bush-
fire area in Vic. was made near Warburton.
A father and mother had tried to save their
children by clasping two of them in their
arms, while a third had been sheltered under
a log. All were dead. .
* * * *
“Wick”: When the fires passed over
Noojee (Vic.) only two buildings were left
standing. One is the church, which was seen
burning three times and yet was not de-
stroyed. The other is the pub. Nature is a
wonderful old lady when it comes to balanc-
ing things.
“T.P.”: The Commonwealth officers were
treated to good and sufficient reasons by
some of the persons called upon to show
cause why they didn’t vote at the recent
elections. One widow explained that she
had eight young children. The tvyo eldest
were out earning a crust. On their return
she prepared tea, and then, taking her two
youngest in a pram, started out for the
booth six miles distant. On arriving at the
town she was blocked at the railway-cross-
ing by a stationary goods train and arrived
at the booth five minutes too late. The
letter concluded with “I done my best.”
Another woman, whose husband was droving
on the Monaro Plains, “had to cross a river
in a cage,” taking with her two small child-
ren. She couldn’t work it, so “got frightened
and went home.” In each case the Depart-
ment expressed itself as entirely satisfied
with the efforts made to comply with the
law.

“Akran”: A pensioner near Wardell
(N.S.W.) had a fine crop of passion-fruit,
but as he seldom
left home the young-
fry thereabout had
little chance of
purloining it. One
of the lads kept
watch, and one even-
ing told his chums
he was sure that
the old man must
have gone away.
“I ’aven’t seen him
for two days and
’is door ’asn’t been
open.” They then
raided the vines,
but before their
pockets were half
filled, a hollow voice
sounded from some-
where and there
was a hurried re-
treat. As the old
chap did not ap-
pear all that day,
another raid was
organised, but again
the uncanny voice
sent the boys fly-
ing. Eventually the
butcher discovered
the reason of the
eerie noise. The
pensioner had
dropped into a
thousand - gallon
tank to clean it
and couldn’t get
out. He’d been in-
side it for four
days and nights.
“Black Tracker”: For presence of mind
and resourcefulness when faced with unex-
pected dangers the Australian bushwoman
has no equal in the wide world. A young
wife of a settler at White Hills (Vic.) was
alone in her little bush home with her four-
montlis-old child. Having caught a mouse in
a trap she called the cat and went to the front
verandah in search of the animal. While there
she glanced at the home-made cradle in which
her infant was sleeping. To her horror a
black snake lay coiled up with its head ex-
tended to within a few inches of the baby
hands; The imprisoned mouse, probably
catching sight of the snake, started to squeak.
The snake raised its head and became ex-
cited. The woman quickly placed the trap
on the floor close to the snake, which was
soon keen on the capture of the mouse.
While it was struggling with the trap the
woman used the back of a hair-broom to
some purpose. It was equally characteristic
of this fine type of woman that she made no
mention of the incident on her husband's re-
turn, in order to spare him useless worry.

“Sturt”: The Electric Supply Co.. in
Adelaide has had trouble from a cause unique
in local experience. Nearly four months
without rain brought a heavy dust-coating
on all the insulators; then a light shower
after midnight turned the dust into a paste,
without (in some eases) being heavy enough
to w-ash it off. Insulation ceased, and in
the small hours of the morning nearly 20
poles were on fire in various suburbs.

“Oilskin”: The casual Australian again.
The other Monday some fearsome headlines
in the Argus —“ Four Men Missing: Blown
Out to Sea; Signals of Distress; Search by
Tug Fails” —preceded an account of how- on
the previous morning four amateur fishermen
in a rowing-boat had been caught in the track
of a northerly gale and vanished into the
silence of Port Phillip. All the Sabbath a
tug had cruised over a vast expanse of w-ater
(in the wrong direction, it subsequently
turned lout), and parties of police and
civilians had searched the southci’n foreshores
vainly for four bodies and a staved-in boat.
Meanwhile the four mariners, who had had
the savvy to keep the nose of their boat to
the wind, were blow-n ashore safely at a lonely
spot near Frankston, and a good Samaritan
of a motorist had returned them to their sub-
urban homes, where they had a change of
clothing qnd a feed, dismissed the incident
from their minds and started graft as usual
just when Argus readers were learning of
the disaster in which they had been engulfed.
It was one of the “drowned” men who, after
reading the newspaper, decided that it was
up to him to ’phone the police that there
wasn’t a corpse in the party.

“G.R.” Re the financial possibilities of

“ Sucre”: Queens-

than its fair share
of queer wills and
testaments. I re-
call two. At Rock-
hampton a will was
admitted written on
a blank page of a
race-book. Near
Longreach in 18S9
a swaggie’s body
was found on a
bush track; in his
swag were Q. N.

body was a billy-
can on which had
been scratched with a penknife the words:
“I leave everything to my old cobber Billy
Sims.” Probate was duly granted.

"Simon”: An enterprise showing nerve
and originality was that of the Sydney man
who used to sham drunkenness and get him-
self lumbered regularly to the lock-up in the
patrol waggon. While the van was proceed-
ing to its goal he was proceeding through
the passengers. Suspicions were gradually
aroused by the fact that he had always
plenty of monev in his pockets when h,e w r as
searched prior to being shot into a cell, while
nobody who had travelled Vith him ever
had as much as a rusty nail. One night a

MARCH.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Some months we know as flappers gay,
And some as matrons stately;
The former skip like lambs at play,
The latter walk sedately.
A provocative smile some wear.
Some seem stuck-up and “horty”;
But March is still a lady fair
Who’s very nearly forty.
She knows not whether to be cold
Or give us burning kisses—-
She hates to show she's growing- old,
Or pride herself as Mrs.
She’ll sometimes whisk our hats in air
And ape a hoyden sporty ;
Yes, March is like a lady fair
Who's getting on for forty.
At times, with eyes of sunny blue,
She’ll smile on us serenely,
And then, as other charmers do,
She shows her temper meanly.
She alternates composure rare
With madcap freaks and rortv,
For March is still a lady fair
Who’s on the edge of forty.
You cannot call her Autumn yet,
Lest Summer make a sortie.
So March remains a lady fair
Who’s pretty nearly forty.

“Nick Bottom”: Mention of the queer
names bestowed upon their offspring by

me to remark that one needn’t travel so tar
from home to find youngsters suffering from
their parents’ kinks. Within a radius of a
few miles 1 am able to point to one girl who
has been labelled Chlorine, than which there
are few gases more obnoxious. Another maid
answers to Clilorodyne. But the most tragic
case of all is that of a fine lad who bears
Uric as his one and only Christian name.

“Passenger”: The other day at Windsor
(near Brisbane) a locomotive cut into a
motor-’bus at a level-crossing; the bus was
reduced to matchwood and 30 out of its 34
occupants injured. One young woman de-
scribed her experiences thus: “I saw an
engine, and then there was an awful bump.
Something like wood fell all over my legs,
and the seat collapsed. I pulled myself up
by catching hold of an iron bar. Then x
followed another girl and found that I had
stepped into the cab of the engine between
the driver and the fireman.” Fiction has
to struggle hard to keep up with fact now-
adays.

“Teller”: Long experience makes it pos-
sible for a bank-teller to diagnose fairly
accurately the requirements of a client
as soon as the latter enters the door-
way. He is able to judge, as a
rule, whether the customer wishes to
pay in, cash a cheque, leave a pass-book or
do one of a dozen other things. But I
remember once being baffled by a sun-tanned
customer at Sale (Vic.) —-I found out after-
wards he was a drover-—who entered the
banking chamber and seated himself on a
chair. Presently he proceeded in silence to
unlace and take off a boot while the staff
watched him bewilderedly. Next he took off
a sock, extracted a £5O-note therefrom,
hobbled over to the counter and asked me
to “break it down” for him. The paper,
after it had occasioned some spirited com-
ment, was consigned to the Melbourne office
as “mutilated”—the general term for any
currency unfit for circulation.

“Iford”: Some of the age-old regulations
of the House of Commons —more often than
not slavishly imitated by overseas legislatures
—are quite the last word in blithering im-
becility. The hoary (and uncouth) usage
which forbids a bareheaded member to get
into conversational grips with the Speaker
after a division has been called for has been
responsible for a whole lot of damfoolisliuess
at St. Stephen’s. I can remember an incident,
some 40 years ago, in which Gladstone figured :
the G.0.M., who had mislaid his No. 8 hat,
borrowed a neighbor’s 64 tile to enable him
to do his duty by his country. On another
occasion a member who had left his lid

outside sought to comply with the law of
centuries by bashing a blotting-pad into
something remotely resembling a cocked hat,
and, I believe, passed muster. But the limit
was surely reached a week or two ago—and
the incident was thought worth cabling to
the ends of Empire—when a red-headed
Labor M.P. from the Clyde had to bespeak
the temporary loan of a lady Laborite’s
“small, green-trimmed toque” to surmount
his beetling brows and make himself visible
to the chap behind the mace. The House,
it is added, relapsed into “uproarious mirth”
• —as well it may have, not so much at the
sight of a man in a woman's hat as at the
contemplation of its own fatuousness in toler-
ating such a rule. But I suppose the farce will
go on until someone who has made hatless-

“Psycho”: An interesting bit of criminal
psychology has cropped up in Melbourne. A
seaman, only 25, and therefore presumably
not yet tired of the drama of life, received
a sentence for housebreaking and stealing.
A few days later he was up on a second and
similar charge. Being asked if he had any-
thing to say why sentence should not be
passed, he replied: “It does not matter to
me what you do. I will cut my throat in
the end, and then I will have the laugh on
all of you.” In his little life the criminal
bulks so large—he thinks the whole world
is watching him like a hungry cat stalking
the last mouse in the world.

“Ginger”: Touching the crowded condition
of Wavcrley Cemetery (B. 4/2/’26). A
year or two ago an aunt of mine instructed
her son to see if he could acquire a grave
there for her future use and that of her
family. He found there was hardly a block
available; but finally a tomb-
stone maker directed my cousin’s
attention to an advt. in the
S. M. Herald. He interviewed
the advertiser (a lady), who
was asking £lOO for the pro-
perty she had to dispose of, and
was on the point of accepting
the terms when it occurred to
him to ask “Of com*se, there is
no body in the grave?” The
seller hesitated. “Well, yes,
there is one,” she finally ad-
mitted, “but I can have it re-
moved.” He called the deal off.

“Pimlico”: One wonders occasionally if
the England of the haut noblesse is to its
old self true. The Earl of Craven, who
only escaped deportation from the United
States by streaking over the Canadian border,
was accused of some moral lapses with the
Countess Catlicart. The lady herself, who
has been twice divorced, was detained at
Ellis Island for “moral turpitude.” The
row the Countess kicked up drew attention
to Craven, a one-time partner in her sins,
and he, confronted with American reporters,
“admitted adultery” with the detenue. This
is a shocking departure from the accepted
rule among the caste of Vere de Vere that
no admission of any sort implicating a woman
can possibly be made by anyone with pre-
tensions to good breeding. Royal princes
have committed flagrant perjury in this
cause, and by doing so have more than ever
endeared themselves to peer and proletariat
alike. Somehow I doubt if the Earl, what-
ever services he may presently render to the
British nation, will ever be able to live
down this lapse into truth.
* * * *
“Ben Zine”: A railway s.m. in the Wai-
tara (M.L.) district was recently given a
curious problem to grapple with. A Maori
resident died while away from home, and the
sorrowing relatives had the corpse forwarded
per rail to the home-town. A huge tangi
was arranged, and from near and far came
Horis, Henares and Ilinemoas to pay the
last tributes to the dead. Two relatives went
to the station to take delivery of the remains,
but were met with a peremptory demand for
£5 Bs. for freight. They offered £3, all they
had, but the s.m. refused to take anything
less than the full amount. The envoys re-
turned to the pali and sent round the hat,
but all thqy could raise was a cheque on the
new Ratana Bank for 15s. With this they
sought to reopen negotiations, but the s.m.
proved adamant. “Well, if you not take te
plurry three-fifteen, you keep him,” was
the bereaved mourners’ ultimatum. But the
weather was warm, and the s.m. found it
impossible to go to that length in his regard
for the regulations. Next morning a pro-
cession (with no Maori mourners) started
for the cemetery, and in the lead was llie
coffin on which the M.L. Railway Depart-
ment is still owed £5 Bs. But Hori and
Henare didn’t allow the shortage of a corpse
to interfere with the tangi.

“Gouger”: “Cranky Joe” came from a
N.S.W. North Coast home where Dad had
nailed a horseshoe over the cow-bails for
luck and Mum had nailed one in blue plush
over the kitchen door. Joe himself had
always solemnly alighted when he espied a
cast-off shoe, and, spitting on (he iron, had
faithfully thrown it over his shoulder for
luck. Consequently, when as a solitary
scout he drew a shrapnel-burst on himself
and the bullet-hail did no damage except
to neatly chip off the near-side shoe of
his old charger, he hopped off quick and
lively and collected it before galloping for
cover. For weeks after, unknown to his
cobbers, he wore that shoe upon his flannel,
just over the heart. Two days before the
attack on Beerslieba he developed a sudden
cold sweat. It struck him that the shoe only
framed his heart, and did not shield it at all.
It was, in fact, an invitation for a bull’s-eye,
and Joe felt certain he was going out. The
night before the stunt he sought the farrier-
sergeant and explained his trouble. The
farrier was old iu service and understand-
ing, and almost within echo of the Beersheba
redoubts hammered the shoe into a not un-
shapely shield. Padding it withflannel.it neatly
covered what Cranky Joe considered was his
heart. lie slept soundly that night. Next
afternoon he was one of the first men in
the galloping charge to sway and roll from
his saddle. He came-to a couple of hour-
later with a doctor examining his chest
curiously. Over the heart in ugly blue was;
the shape of the shield, and on the shield
itself the remnants of a flattened bullet.
Joe put in a fortnight in hospital recovering
from shock, but to-day he is serenely milk-
ing cows next the old home with the blue
plush horseshoe over its kitchen door. Over
his own mantelpiece is a little roughly-made
shield splattered with Turkish lead.

“Sixenate”: A cheerful insolvent has been
ushered into the Sydney Bankruptcy Court,
a man who, according to his own statement,
made quantities of money fly without ever
having any of his own worth speaking about,
lie was a jackeroo getting £1 per week and
keep when he married the daughter of a
squatter who died worth £100,600. With
his gilded marriage he became nominally
even less financial, being installed as honorary
manager of the station his wife owned. The
absence of salary, however, was offset by the
lady’s complacency in leaving the drawing
of all cheques to hubby, and never troubling
to check his accounts at the bank. The
spendthrift unfolded a long tale of money
lost at the races and gambling, including
£4OO on one horse; he seemed to regard it
as an extenuating circumstance that the
animal lost by only half a head and the
jockey was censured for careless riding. The
upshot was a bankruptcy in which one
liability amounted to £7500, and there were
no assets but the bankrupt’s continued cheer-
fulness. Apparently the insolvent will re-
main as well off as ever he was as long as;
he does nothing to forfeit his wife’s regard.-

“Verri”: Government red tape (B.
18/2/’26) ? After a severe winter the King
Country Maoris were reported short of cloth-
ing, and benevolent city folk collected much
raiment for them. The Railway Department,
approached for free carriage, said it would
refer the matter to Wellington ; Wellington
referred it to the Native Department, which
in turn passed it on to somewhere else. These
references occupied about 10 weeks, during
which time it might be presumed that the
Maoris either got used to doing without
clothes or died of pneumonia. Finally, when
an exalted secretary wrote to the chief
charity worker a belated offer to truck free
a limited quantity of clothing, that exas-
perated woman reached for her fountain-
pen and replied: “My good man, all that
stuff was run through to the King Country
free, nine weeks ago. The matter is now
closed.” The secretary who reserved to
himself the privilege of closing such matters
was a very wrathful man for a few days.

He was born on February 29.

A generous man, and a “good boss,” the
head of the old-established Lassetter firm
in Sydney, who died last week, was inclined
to carry his military pride into commerce;
the ad. man or traveller who approached with

“General,” was half-way to a good contract;
the employee who forgot the rank was half-
way towards the sack.
Walter Kingsmill, although only three
years a Federal Senator, is a possible succes-
sor to the Presidential chair that Tom Givens
is about to relinquish. Kingsmill has had a
Parliamentary experience of close on 30
years; he arrived in the W.A. Assembly in
’97 and became a Minister four years later.
Then he was shifted to the Council because
it suited Walter James; but after James fell
out of politics no portfolio ever came
“King.v’s” way again and he settled down
into the less strenuous and much steadier
job of being an officer of Groperland’s Upper
House. First he was Chairman of Commit-
tees, then President. He would have had a
life lien on that prized job, but the loss of
his seat in ’22 set him looking round for a
new possie, which he found a few months
later when he, headed the Senate poll for W.A.
Kingsmill is something of a scholar and a
good deal of an out-door sportsman, besides
being a practised speaker and Parliamen-
tarian.

Lord Stradbroke will wind up his term
as Governor of Victoria on April 7, and will
then leave for the Cold Country via Sydney
and North America. Some people thought
he would finish up on February 24, the fifth
anniversary of his swearing-in ; but, as he is
not bound exactly to five years, to settle
doubts Acting-Premier Peacock found it
necessary to ask him when he was going.
In relating his exploits to his neighbors
around Henharn Hall he will be able to tell
them how, all on one fine day, he attended a
meeting of the Executive Council in Mel-
bourne at 11 o’clock and declared mushrooms
to be farm produce, and, after flying to
Eehuca, inspected a soldier settlement and
had dinner with the Mayor. Next morning,
using the same means of transport, he
“dropped in” upon Mildura.
A kinsman of Robert Louis Stevenson has
answered the last roll-call in Maoriland. L.
H. B. Wilson’s mother and the mother of
R.L.S. were sisters. Wilson was born in
Dublin 77 years ago, his father being a
colonel of the Royal Artillery. He arrived
in M.L. in 1867 and joined up with the civil
service, which he forsook after 27 years to
become a land and estate agent. A fine
collection of Stevenson relics went up in
smoke a few years ago when his house was
burned.

Canon Arthur Coombes, a former master
of The King’s School, Parramatta (N.S.W.),
has died at Chichester (Eng.) on the 04th
birthday of Australia’s oldest school. Coombes
joined T.K.S. in 1889 as maths, teacher
and cricket coach, and 10 years later was
defeated by A. H. Champion by one vote for
the headmastership. His finest work at the
school was the inauguration of the museum
which bears his name. He returned to Eng-
land in 1900, and headmastercd till last year
at Hurstpierpoint, Sussex.
“Bishop” Leadbeater is back in Sydney
from his meeting with the Theosophists’ new
“Messiah,” the Hindu youth Krishnamurti.
With him came “Bishop” Arundale, principal
of the National University at Madras, and
his full-blooded Indian wife. These two
propose to lecture in Australasia. With
these three out of the seven Apostles said to
have been selected by the new Messiah (there
will be 12 in the full team) Australia
seems to be carrying an overweight of the
Theosopliical elect just at present. And it is
all the more remarkable seeing that the
breach between the local Theosophists still
continues.
Laurie Chapman, of the Yic. Chief Sec.’s
Department, and F. 11. Wickham, of the
Premier’s office, two of the younger genera-
tion of officials, proved the other day that
the shackles of red tape can be burst in
such an emergency as that of the recent
bush-fires. Chapman was told to assemble
tents, blankets, mattresses, cooking utensils
and other supplies and get them off at once
by special train to Warragul and Moe. He
did. To a man every Government official
co-operated. It was only when he came to
private carrying establishments that he had
to do some wliip-cracking. Wickham was
ordered to leave at once by car, find out how
things were, and suggest what should be
done. A few hours later his report was in
hand. Then Acting-Premier Peacock said:
“Now go along to the Railway Department,
Country Roads Board and Forestry Depart-
ment, and see that they do what you recom-
mend.” And it was so. If tradition is to
be upset in this way Government depart-
ments will cease to be what they are.
When Jack Smith, president of the Mel-
bourne Eight Hours Day committee, came
to Sydney last week on various labor affairs
and his own pleasure there was no hot
train journey for him and no heavy travel-
ling expenses for any organisation. He
came over in his own motor-car. Though
his stipend as secretary of the Australian
Clerks’ Association probably is not beyond
the dreams of avarice, Smith has never
suffered from financial stringency. lie _ is

keeps him very comfortably whilst he in-

root of the matter —he is prominent in

The manager of the South Axis, cricketers
on their visit to the Eastern States in Janu-
ary, H. J. McKay, was a sick man at that
time, though he pluckily kept going, and he
survived only about three weeks. He was
himself a prominent player before the war,
and his slow bowling helped S.A. to win the
Sheffield Shield about.l9l3. He was a great
worker, in either business or play, and was
for some time the State president of the
A.N.A.
“11.C.K.” (London) : Joe Cook, after re-
turning from one of the frequent conferences
in Europe for the well-being of Australia,
lost the dispatch-box containing all his
papers. The legions of Australia House
scoured the continent for a week before the
box was found in the company of an honest
but stupid French porter. This loss recalled
that when Joe returned with Billy Hughes
from the tour in which they helped to win
the war his decorations were stolen. All the
King’s policemen failed to restore them; the
only smart thing the sleuths did was to
keep it out of the papers. For nearly six
months the potentate was without a decora-
tion ; then his cheque for renewals was
honored in London, and a bright new set of
medals and ribbons sent to Australia.
Percy Galbraith, ex-police inspector and
good sport, took the last, long trail at
Townsville (N.Q.) lately after a stirring life.
After a cadetship in the British Navy he
smelt powder in the Maori War. Then he
joined the Queensland Mounted Police; and
the aboriginal tribes of the northern ranges
saw to it that he did not lack excitement.
He was an authority on aboriginal lore and
one of the pioneer Rugby football players of
Bananaland.
Dr. Oliver Leitch, of Port Pirie (S.A.),
died with tragic suddenness while being fare-
welled at a large gathering on the eve of his
removal to Adelaide. Born in 1875, he was
a student during the historic “hospital
trouble” of Adelaide in the ’nineties, and so
took his medical degree in Melbourne. All
this century he has been practising at Port
Pirie, where he had a great reputation for
skill in cases of lead-poisoning and such
matters. He intended to start in Adelaide
as a specialist in heart-complaints.
Bill Slater, Labor member for Dundas
(Vic.), who will be elected chief president
of the Australian Natives’ Association at the
annual corroboree at Sorrento on March 23,
will be the first M.P. to get the job since
1912. In that year Lemmon, M.L.A., also
a Laborite, completed a term. Slater, like
Lemmon, will secure the job as a reward for
solid A.N.A. work and not because Labor
has captured the conference —which it hasn’t.
How reasonable Labor men can be when not
dominated by the party machine Lemmon
and Slater have convincingly demonstrated.
The new president of the Headmasters’
Association of the State schools of S. A. is

the Gordon Club —all these call him father.
Vic. Minister of Forests Richardson, who
h.as had to apologise for the remissness of
the State Parliament in dealing with the
danger of busli-fires, had the demon on his
own doorstep, so to speak. A co. of which
lie is managing director owns a huge ramb-
ling boardinghouse at Lome, where the big
bush comes right down and dips its feet in
Bass Strait. Firefighters just saved the
outfit from one onslaught of the terror, and
then all communication with Lome was cut
off, so that for several days it was not known
whether the town was alive or dead.
The R.C. controversial mantle in N. S.
Wales, which had been worn for many years
by the militant Vincentian chief, Maurice
O’Reilly, has fallen on A. G. Clarke, who
resides in Lang’s electorate but doesn’t vote
for him. Clarke, who is a graduate of
Cambridge, was an Anglican parson for years
in the Cold Country, and after ’verting,
about 15 yeai’s ago, went to Maoriland. He
specialises in chaplaincies, which gives him
unlimited leisure for study. Being well
ribbed up with this world’s wealth he lately
presented Archbishop Kelly with £3OOO, with
a promise of more at his finish. He is just
on 60.
Bananaland claims to have within its
borders the two tallest cattle-raisers in the
Commonwealth. George Creed, of the Lang-
horn district, Central Queensland, bosses his
holding from a height of 6ft. 61in. in his
socks, and he lias ballast and grit enough to
make him formidable in a mix-up. With his
“all over 6ft.” relatives he trekked 80 miles
during the recent shipping hold-up at Glad-
stone (Q.) to throw in his weight on the
side of his fellow beef-breeders. • The other
long 'un is Alf Tailor, of Colosseum Creek,
North Coast line. The crown of his head
hits the air Oft. 74in. from the ground with
his boots off, and he is no weed, either. He
is as good-natured as he is long and as active
as a mountain kangaroo.
W. L. PARSONS (Nat.), who defeated
Moses Gobi (L.) for the Anyas (S.A.)
seat. He is the smallest member in, the
Federal Lower House.
“A. de B.” : Recently there arrived in the
semi-civilisation of Derby (W.A.) A. E.
Smitheram, prospector with the Michael
Terry “Pommy” Exploring Party that
motored along the stock-routes. “Sugar-
bag” Smitheram is a well-known gold-seeker
in the Territory; his sobriquet comes from
his working attire—a sugar-bag with the
corners cut out to admit the legs, and the
upper end tied by strings across his chest.
Long years among the abandoned workings
of the N.T. have tanned Smitheram to a rich
chocolate hue, and it requires his mate’s
solemn assurance or partial disrobing to
prove him a white man. It was at the 88-mile
camp, on the railway, I once ran against
“Sugar-bag” and his partner Reade, and lis-
tened to an earnest discourse on gold poten-
tialities of the N.T. and a solemn assurance
that southerners did not know a good thing
when they saw it, or they would never let
shows like the Union and Lady Grace lie
idle.
H. C. McConnan, of St. Andrew’s Church,
Benalla (Vic.), has completed his 42nd year
on the job. He will now figure in the year-
book of the kirk in Australia as the long-
distance record-breaker.
George Vawdrey, formerly of Stawell
(Vic.) and recently of Ballarat, has gone
over the hill. He came from Cornwall, where
they breed miners for export, about 65 years
ago, and was long-time manager of the North
Cross Reef Co. at Stawell, which paid nearly
£2,000,000 in divs.
The last post has sounded for yet another
Crimean veteran—Richard Heath, for whom
the tolling bell had to strike 96 times. He
was in the Army Works Corps during the
war with Russia, and saw Sebastopol; when
it was all over he came to Australia. Dr.
Lang married him in his own Church Hill
residence, for many years past a boarding-
house ; the veteran had been a widower for
nearly 40 years.
Captain Walter H. Smith, master of the
Union Co.’s tanker Orowaite, has become a
pilot in the Anglican interest, and is to take
over the navigation at Tolago Bay (M.L.).
Smith, who served on British mine-sweepers
during the Big Smash, was fourth officer on
the Perthshire when that packet broke her
tail shaft about 24 years ago and drifted in
the Pacific for 45 days before she was
sighted.
*Tlie children of recently-dead Michael
Murray, resident of Maitland (N.S.W.) for
74 years, took to the religious life almost
an masse. Two of his four sons became
priests, and all his three daughters nuns ; one of
them was that Reverend Mother Regis Murray
who founded many convents of the Sisters
of Mercy in Maoriland. Michael was 13
when he reached Maitland from Ireland ; very
soon after he started a butchery business,
which is still conducted by one of the sons
who kept outside monastic walls.
Canon James Studds, who has answered
a call to the parish of Heaven, preached his
first sermon at the age of 15 and started his
shepherding as a missionary in English slum
areas and fishing-villages. He arrived in
Australia over 60 years ago, and settled
down after a while as rector of Junee in
1883, remaining in charge there for 33 years
until his retirement.
AN IMPERTINENCE.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
I am the centre of the universe;
My fate is writ in stars. The laden days
Of light and shade have labored to my praise
And my delight. For better and for worse,
The splendor and the tumult of the strife
Shape me; and, for my learning, every hour
Reveals new color centred in a flower,
Or hides iii song the wisdom that is life.
When I am glad the whole world laughs with me;
When I am sad a' shadow like a curse
Of idle words drifts past the mirror-face
Of nature. I am loved and I am free.
I am the centre of the universe;
But every man’s my rival for the place !

ABORIGINALITIES

BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Bad Australian” : My memories of the
bad old days on the selection run along the same
lines as those of “Ess” (B. 28/l/’26) ; although
we were located nearly 1000 miles apart, the rules
governing the exchange of labor seem to have been
identical, even to the detail of one boy equals half a
man. But there was one denizen of our secluded
“pocket” who rejected that equation. When the old man
sent two of my younger brothers to work off a dead
horse for Paddy Devine, that conservative Greenlander
treated the proposition with derision. “Oho, that's
id, is id?” he said. “G’wan now, an’ tell yeer ould
man that id’s a man’s wurruk for a man’s wurruk
wid Paddy Devine, an’ moreover that whin a man
have the misforchune to have wan b’y at wurruk he
have but ha’f a b’y, an’ whin he have two b’ys divil
the b’y he have ad all.” When one of the rude
forefathers of the hamlet killed a beast he kept a
part for his own use and divided the rest among
(lie neighbors, who returned the compliment when
their harness casks were being replenished from their
own stock This custom panned out all right until
old Jock McSandy, who rarely killed a beast of his
own and had been living on other folks' beef for
surnrise l^ 1 , a g * Ve D ° swood p «*«t a pleasant
sui prise by sending each householder about 401 b of
hue fat fresh pork. When dinner was in course of
1 epaiatron on the following day an odor like that
of a glue factory ,n full blast arising from every
in t. e U S r'f eS r ed n that fhefe Was s °mething putrid
in the State of Dogwood. And there was. The
Mcbaudys old boar, the father of all the swine
the Pocket, had died of a surfeit of kail and
sour milk, and the frugal old hatter from the Hebrides
had seized the opportunity of squaring up his out
standing liabilities. After a select committee had
reasoned with McSandy on the subject, he swore of
beef, and reverted to his old diet of haggis and
hominy.
“Dingo”: “N.K.C.” (B* 28/l/’26*) may
make his mind easy as far as the spread of cancer
by dairy cows is concerned. Putting aside a recent
claim, which so far has not been accepted by either
medical men or veterinarians generally, no sound
argument has been advanced to show that
cancer is infectious. On the other hand good
„ can be adduced that it isn’t. Again,
• S . ’ . statcu,ellt that cancer is more prevalent
in the dairying districts is not borne out by statistics
finally true cancer is not nearly as common in
cattle ot any description as is supposed, most of the
reported cases being found on expert examination to
be glandular tuberculosis, actinomycesis, benign
tumors or abscesses.
“Koolamarra”: The fox lias made his way
to the north coast of Queensland, and has already
been responsible for much damage to poultry. He
has a lot to learn about poison, though; a sardine
or a piece of fowl’s liver nicely salted without being
handled will tempt him every time, and in this
respect he can learn much from the dingo. In the
open he is a poor goer, and is easily run down by
a good rider mounted on any sort of a hack I
have never had to run a fox further than a mile
whereas I have often chased a dingo six miles and
then have sometimes lost him. An English neighbor
informs me that in this country the fox has a
thicker and longer coat than' he has in the old land.

Coolabah : Many bush homes have wild
honey as clear as the garden product. At other
homes it is discolored, or has been boiled to im-
prove its appearance
and add to its purity.
People who otherwise
are particular about
the food they eat are
often easily pleased in
regard to honey. To
watch a bushman or
his wife preparing the
stuff is a revelation.
After chopping up the
combs containing not
only honey but young
bees, bees’-bread and
rubbish, the consoli-
dated mass is made
warm and placed in a
chaff-bag suspended
over a dish or tub.
There it is often left
for days, dripping and
collecting dust, ants
and flies Chickens not
uncommonly become
bogged in the mess,
and their little toes
must be scraped before
they are set free. One
could not expect the
honey-getter to waste
even this portion, bees’-nesting being a strenuous job
which lequires pluck. I have seen honey prepared
tor use in this way at a dozen different places.
* * * *
"Bris” : Brisbane’s rat king, Edward Vin-
cent, whom many people thought overpaid at £OOO
a year, earned half his annual salary in his first
month’s work for the City Council by catching
6000 rats. At Is. a head (the old capitation fee)
the Council would have had to pay out £3OO.
Mayor Jolly is believed to have been reading Kip-
Jing s remarks about the deadliness of the female
of the species, for he has induced the Council to
vary the capitation rates by offering Is. fid. a head
for adult female rats and only fid. for adult males.
Ihis change is viewed with disapproval by private'
entei prise rat-catchers, as it is usually the adventurous
males—the bread-winners of the rat family—which
find their way into the traps.
* * * •
X2X : Vhy tlie body of a shark from
which the heart has been taken out is able to swim
madly about in the water is not easy to explain;
but it has been long known that the brain and its
associated mechanism is capable of functioning in
some cases independently of the heart’s action and
even after the latter lias ceased. Some years ago
an eminent French scientist put this forward as the
result of his researches, and said that when a
criminal had been decapitated by the guillotine he
letained a sort of consciousness, being fully aware
of what was going on round him, for a period which
could be measured in minutes. He startled his
audience with the statement that he had attended
one execution and that from the tests which he had
carried out he was positive that the severed head
had understood when he spoke to it.
“Ex-Dig.”; Even if the frog treats the
poisonous properties of clilorine gas with cold in-
difference (B. 3/12/’25), there is something much
more remarkable in the survival of cats in gas-
drenched war-areas. Every night for a fortnight in
the area around the canal and the Bluff, near Ypres,
gas-masks had to be worn for a few hours while
the shells exploded on all sides with that curious
“popping” sound which characterised them, and
even in spite of the masks there were casualties—
six men, who had evidently removed their masks
MR. NEWCHUM PUTS “ ENGLAND'S PRIDE " THROUGH
HER PACES.
while the gas still lingered in their dug-out, were
found dead together. Yet sleek and contented cats
could be seen every day sunning themselves upon
the top of such places as the Victoria dug-outs, which
were a series of comfortable “homes” dug into what
had been a dyke of the canal, as if a little gas
more or less during the night was a matter of
supreme indifference. A Digger with whom I
discussed the phenomenon alleged that the cats,
sensing in some way the danger of the gas when
it began to spread, made a sort of gas-mask of
theii" ftir by licking it until it was damp, and then
burying their noses in it. It seems a possible ex-
planation, especially as the official advice to soldiers
or civilians caught by gas without their gas-masks
was to moisten a sock by a not very inviting
method, and use it as an emergency mask.
* * * *
“Titun”: I can tell “Te W.” (B.
28/l/’26) of one part of Australia where English
skylarks are quite at home. On the Bellarine
peninsula, near Geelong (Vic.), they may be heard
in numbers on any fine day. Also near Portarlington
(Vic.) I’ve heard fully a dozen in full song at
once. Still my money goes on our own magpie or
butcher-bird for sheer beauty of melody.
* * * *
“Pseudo”: A young gin—comely as gins go
—was admitted to Kalgoorlie Hospital suffering a
slight nephritis. Her tribe was camped near by,
and occasionally she was allowed to see visitors.
Mary, however, showed little interest when she saw
them, for the only one she desired to see never came.
After the lapse of some days, her yearnings for
the absent lover were voiced in long drawn cries of
despair. The worried staff held counsel and decided
to force the attendance of the indifferent one. Order-
lies were despatched to the camp, and an angry
Billy brought to the bedside. The doctor gave him
a short lecture on honor, to which the abo. listened.
This over, Billy bent an undecided gaze upon the
patient, who lay devouring his well-built form with
love-lit eyes. With a shrug he turned to the doctor
and the nurses, and, speaking with as much passion
as an abo. can work up, said, “Sick gin no good t’
me. Me trackit now longa Mabel. Mabel plurry
fat!” There was nothing for it but to let him go.
Mary reverted to her wails of woe. Her complaint
was not serious, but she died four days later.
“Jim Carew”: Is there anything a cow
won’t eat? Fishing near Wiseman’s Ferry (3SF.S.W.)
a couple of weeks back I struck a school of medium-
sized bream. As I caught them I tossed the take
into an open half-case behind me. When I had
landed about a dozen, I wound the line up and
turned round to pick up the fish. The case was
empty, but near by stood an old Jersey cow with a
bit of the last fish sticking out of her mouth.
* * * *
“N.K.C.”: The dingo sometimes gets ven-
turesome in winter. Four years ago I was living on
the Baw Baw Plateau (Vic.). It was bitterly cold.
I used to walk about half a mile with my husband
in the morning on his way to work. On three or
four mornings I felt that there was something dogging
me in the scrub near our track, but the fog being
very heavy I detected nothing. Then one morning,
while I was stooping to gather an armful of wood,
something leapt at me from the scrub. It was a
huge, thin, snarling yellow dog. I wheeled round
and struck at him with a sodden branch. Fortu-
nately I was near a big gum, and getting my back
against it I fought the animal off. Finally it
turned tail and slunk back to the scrub. Next day
the men rode out and shot a large yellow dingo in
the scrub near our house.
Diarmid : “AtleL.” asks (B. 7/l/‘2t>)
for the identification of a northern parrot and a wren.
I think the latter is the orange-backed wren, which
is black with orange-scarlet on the back. The
parrot suggests the red-sided parrot, except that
AdeL. s specimen is small. It might possibly be a
young male bird.
* * * *
“Bullwhanger”: For some weeks Port
Jackson has had the appearance of an inlet in
the (.reek Archipelago. The prawn season is in full
swing, and dozens of
gentlemen in the fishing
line of business from
that part of the world
are busy night and day
net-hauling. The north
shores of jhe harbor
are their favorite
grounds, and some good
catches are being
made, as this is a
record season. 1
watched a couple of
Greeks at work in
Mostnan Bay the other
day and saw the “fisher-
man’s luck” myth get
a nasty knock. They
had shot the net near
the Musgrave-street
wharf, and were haul-
ing it in when the
ferry-steamer arrived.
Leaving the wharf, she
fouled the net. The
boat was jerked after
the ferry as the net
took the strain, and
two amazed and gesticu-
lating Dagoes let the
net-rope go. They
then went across the
bay, borrowed a n
anchor and line, and
dropped it where they reckoned the net was, and
luckily got it first time. Not only was it intact, but
it contained a good haul of the whiskered crusta-
ceans.
* * * *
“Aud” : How far can the unaided human
voice be heard? Evidence adduced recently in
London includes the leading ease of the town-crier
at Burnham-on-Trent, one J. Cox, who can emit a
shout that is heard seven miles away. There is a
hotel porter in Spain whose bawling has been heard
four kilometres away. In Sicily a f.a.q. scream can
be heard three miles off, and the shepherd lads of
Corsica have a call that can carry about the same
distance across mountain valleys. The folk of
Gornera, in the Canary Islands, practise long-distance
whistling. They take their time about launching
this signal, but when it is fairly going it reaches
a pitch near the upper end of the audible gamut, and
can be heard five miles away. It seems time some
gifted Abo.-liar jumped into the symposium with an
account of 'the great Australian coo-ee, which I have
known to carry ‘l2 miles, though that was on a
boomerang course.
* * * *
“Fitz”: In the early days Bobin, on the
N.S.W. North Coast, was noted for the size and
ferocity of its fleas. Dick the Digger, whenever he
came from the old Cells diggings to Wingham, used
WOULD BE A PITY TO WASTE IT.
“ ’Are per gotta lirred bit us meat, Missus,
or puddin ', or such like? The kind lady
next door gave me some medicine to take
after meals.”
to camp at Bobin, and where other visitors would
buy insecticides, Dick relied for protection on his
big curly retriever. Prior to turning in for the
night he would catch one-eyed Rover, and put him
into bed, covering him up. The dog rather liked the
attention. One-eyed Rover remained there for at
least a quarter of an hour, and was then lifted out
and hunted into the cold night. Dick the Digger
next hopped into bed, and slept the sleep of the
just.

THE ROAD TO WELSHMAN’S.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The road to Welshman’s Lead, where 30,000 men
are said to have gone in the gold rush of the forties,
is now? almost unused and is overgrown with grass.”
Who trod the road to Welshman's
In crowded days of old,
When all the land was tilled and thrilled
With wondrous tales of gold ;
When story after story
Fired hope and kindled greed
For gleaming wealth to make and take
Along the Welshman’s Lead?
Along the road to Welshman’s
There surged a human tide,
The weak grown brave, the strong gone wrong
Trudged onward side by side;
With haste their footsteps quickened
To reach the golden gleam,
Its treasures rare to snatch and match
The splendors of their dream!
Adown the road to Welshman’s
They came from far away,
And broken men of game and shame
With laughing hope were gay ;
Young innocence went jostling
Old guilt as nearest mate,
While sounded clear to all the call
To urge a prize from fate.
Who trod the road from Welshman’s
When lure and gleam were dead,
When radiant hope was chilled and stilled
And golden dreams had fled ?
Sad-eyed for luck that missed them,
There ebbed the human tide,
■ The duped and tricked of fate or mate
To whom false hope had lied.
“ HULLO, WEARY—LOST YOUR WAY?”
Yet on that road from Welshman’s
Were strength and courage born;
The men whom fortune spurned had learned
All weakling ways to scorn.
Clear-eyed and uncomplaining
From tracks where hope was banned,
They turned anew hope-fllied to build
The glory of the land.
And now the road to Welshman’s
With grass is soft and green;
Along the slopes all bright with light
No tides of life are seen.
The old ways are untrodden,
Dong past the old distress;
And Welshman's, lost to name and fame,
Is tombed in quietness!
VICTORIA.

Ivriz : “Coot” (B. 24/12/’25) wants to
know the origin of the term “cockeye-bob,” applied
in the Nor’-West to baby willy-willies, or bursts of
wind which commence without the slightest warning,
blow fiercely for a short time and as quickly fizzle
out. A wind is named from the direction froni which
it blows; the cockeye-bob blows from all points of
the compass. It seems to have come from the
nati\ e word “kikobor.’ What the native word means
I do not know, but “cockeye-bob” seems to be the
nearest the white man can get to the pronunciation'
of the native name, just as the “wurly-wurly” of
the native has become the “willy-willy” of the white.

“Coppertop”: I can help “Jim Carew” (B.
14/l/’26), who has had the misfortune to be cursed
with a camphor laurel. Let him bore holes about
12in. deep with a lin. auger into the centre of the
trunk and fill them with arsenic, then plug the
holes and leave the trees for about three months,
by which time he will find its roots as dead as door-
nails. The best time to do the job is when the sap
is on the down grade.
A CLERICAL ERROR.
“Didn't I tell you never to bother me again?”
“I crave your pardon, Madam, but it is the fault of my secretary;
he has neglected to remove your name from my visiting-list.”
“A.M.”: The dormouse opossum is not as
rare as correspondents seem to Believe. While in
Parilla (S.A.) stump-picking, or “emu-bobbing” as
the old hands termed it, I came across several of the
little chaps. There was not much difficulty in catch-
ing them, as they would hop about four feet away
and sit on their haunches with a “catch me if you
can” expression on their quaint faces. I found to
my discomfort that they had very sharp teeth and,
though friendly little chaps, would not hesitate to
nip if they were hurt. The teeth are small and
pointed like a bat’s, so I concluded that they are
'usect eaters and would probably die in captivity.
“Trapper”: There are still a few capable
beer drinkers at large. During Foundation Day
week-end a van loaded with a rabbiting party halted
at a northern Vic. pub, and after some financial
negotiations with Bung all hands busied themselves
rolling sundry nine-gallon casks of ale to their
conveyance. A few minutes later the van returned.
Journeying along the road, one of the party, running
an eye over the liquid cargo, had made the dis-
quieting discovery that, though the party numbered
eight, there were only seven nine-gai loners aboard.
Tiie rabbiters had immediately decided that eight
into seven wouldn’t go, and after another tarpaulin
muster had returned to the pub to set the matter
right.
HE KNEW IT WAX SOMETHING.
TOM: “Eh, Bill! Whose teed din’ was it?”
BILL: “Wedding? It was a funeral, wasn’t it?”
“FY7”: Splendid rains in s.-w. Queensland,
with hot weather following, have brought the usual
intolerable burden of a sandfly plague upon some of
the districts, notably in the Western Downs. No one
who has not experienced a sandfly visitation can
realise the undiluted hell of it. In addition to
“sandfly fever”—-which is particularly bad in the
present outbreak—it is impossible to move - out of
doors unless gloved and veiled. Indoor relief can
only be got by wire screening and smoke-buckets, and
.the agonies endured by animals, wild and domesti-
cated, are heartbreaking. After the big floods of
1893 in the Balonne district the sandflies killed
thousands of native beasts and birds, as well as caus-
ing considerable mortality among horses and cattle.
M herever possible, smoky fires were maintained, and
it was curious to see horses and cattle strung out
in the trail of smoke from each fire, and keeping in
it as the wind shifted it about.

“Gouger”: My mate and I were travelling
through grassy lowlands of Cape York Peninsula.
The day had been a scorcher, but an afternoon storm
had brought with it
10 minutes’ rain.
Shortly afterwards the
sun smiled. Then the
grass was apparently
born to life. In half
an hour all the billions
of blades were literally
moving for miles
around. It was the
energy of hosts of in-
sects beyond count
emerging from below
that caused the carpet
to tremble. Bodies
about 3in. long, with
broad wings, rose from
the shivering grass,
and in a cloud hum-
med just above our
horses’ heads. The
cloud stretched as far
as we could see; and
I doubt if the mathe-
maticians of the world
could have calculated
its numbers. In a
matter of seconds the
packhorses halted,
then in fright began
circling, rubbing heads
and lashing tails. We
ourselves were blinded
and choking. We
groped together a fire
of brushwood. The
horses rushed the srnoke
and the first blaze was
trodden out. In a cloud of smoke made dense by wet
grass we put in three miserable hours until sun-
down, when the insect host disappeared as un-
accountably as it had come.

Molokihi ’: Human relics are commonly
worn by the natives of the main Papuan range.
A small boy will wear a single phalange from the
hand of his deceased father, the bone being sus-
pended from his neck by a cord of native fibre.
Many adults wear the bones of the entire hand,
strung necklace-fashion, from the neck. In front
of one house I observed a diminutive old woman,
her shoulders encumbered with the complete skeleton
of her lamented husband with the exception of his
headpiece; presumably the slayer had kept that as
a souvenir. The most gruesome decoration I ever
saw was worn by a native of the Samberigi Valley,
the collection of what appeared to be leather washers
proving on closer inspection to be the excised male
nipples of 24 deceased members of an enemy tribe.
“Roma”: It was in the bar of the hotel
at Muekadilla (Q.), where the mud baths are. An
old chap had the floor and was impressing on the
local lads to follow his example and go out into the
world. “Look at me, now,” he said. “I got me
rheumatism in Alaska. I lost this finger in China.
I got me nose broke in London. I’ve been all over
South America. There isn’t much I haven’t seen.”
“I say, Mister,” interrupted a hard-faced shearer,
“have yer ever had the d.t.’s?” “No,” answered
the old man a little stiffly. “Then/’ cut in the other,
“yer ain’t never really seen nothin’,” and he retired
contemptuously into his beer.
* * * #
“Parama”: Here’s another illustration of
the New Guinea native’s belief that no one dies
naturally except from old age, and that death other-
wise is due to the “bad medicine” of a living or
departed enemy. A young man, while up after
cocoanuts, lost his hold and fell some 40 feet. He
was pretty well smashed up, but before he passed
out managed to inform the members of the village
that he had been pushed from the tree by the spirit
of a certain woman, naming her. I learned after-
wards that the fallen buck had been responsible for
that woman’s untimely end at the hands of her
husband, who had discovered things on his return
from 12 months’ work on a distant plantation.
* * * *
“Atherton”: The China camp tin minera
thought they’d solved the tucker problem when they
saw the Bloomfield River niggers eating the clay
of the antbeds, which are scattered in millions over
that district. But only certain clay is eaten, and
to the white man it is very unpalatable. The blacks
scoff it plentifully and without preparation, when
short of other tucker. Around Cooktown and the
Bloomfield streaks of what seem to be white kaolin
are found in the creek banks. The clay—if it is
clay—is dug out, powdered, and sifted free of grit.
It is then kneaded with water into a stiff paste,
formed into cakes and allowed to sun-dry for a
week. These cakes are afterwards wrapped in leaves
and roasted. They are eaten when cool and are
considered a luxury.
* * » *
“F. Act”: You’ve heard of the nigger who
got well because his boss promised him a hiding if
he died. Well, our black boy, Jimmy, very sick
with double pneumonia, decided that he had been
“sent for,” and told the sister so. The sister “went
off” at him. “You must not talk like that. The
doctor did not say you were going to die. Anyway,
the doctor is away, and you simply can’t think of
dying till he comes back.” He got well, and made
no secret of the fact that the sister bluffed him into
a recovery.
* * * *
“Kenric”: Have certain trees an attrac-
tion for lightning? Some water-diviners claim that
it strikes only trees which grow above the crossing-
place of two underground streams. I tested this
theory in two cases. In the first the shattered tree
had been burned down and the land ploughed up,
so that only members of the family knew the spot,
yet the divining-rod indicated two streams crossing
right beneath it. In the second ease the charge had
torn a limb from a large ti’ee which overhung a
smaller one, had then jumped across to the head
of the smaller tree and torn a strip of bark off it,
down to the ground. Two streams, on being traced,
were found to cross immediately beneath this tree.
Another theory is that mistletoe-bearing trees are
an indication of underground water. I do not know
if this applies to isolated trees, but I am con-
vinced that mistletoe lines (i.e., lines of mistletoe-
bearing trees which can sometimes be traced for
miles) are a pretty sure indication. 1 have tested
this theory with several diviners who were not in
the know, asking them to. try the rod over areas
which I had selected on account of these lines. In
each instance the rod turned earthwards as ' thev
crossed the line. They \yere sceptical when I ex-
plained the theory to them, and tested several lines
for themselves with the same results. I know of
a large number of trees on these lines which have
been struck by lightning, but the only bores I
have seen put down on them have yielded salt water.
* * * *
“Alastor”: Meteor Downs station
(C.-W.Q.) sends hundreds of wild pigs yearly to the
public markets, where an average price of over £2
per head is realised. This station has a yearly
wild-pig muster and all hands join in the chase.
V\ hen the pigs are run down by the' horsemen, they
ate tied with straps, and motor-lorries pick them up
and carry them to the station paddocks, where thev
are fed for a month before being sent to market.
Not a rifle is used in the mustering, and no one
for years past has been injured when seizing and
strapping down the porkers. A white pig has for
12 years escaped being rounded up in the annual
muster. It is seen r ound about the station homestead
during the year, but as the annual muster approaches
it disappears.
* * *
“Melos” : Even the imported starling, pro-
bably the most cursed of our bush fowl, justifies
its existence sometimes. On the N.S.W. North Coast a
cocky farmer was horrified one morning to find myriads
of caterpillars laying waste his best grass paddock.
Striding home, he invited his missus to assist him
in demolishing the pest; returning to the scene their
eyes encountered a shining black mass of starlings
cleaning up the enemy in magnificent style. When
the feathered allies rose as one bird and soared into
the adjoining paddock, Mrs. Cocky and hubby were
delighted to find a perfectly' pest-free pasture. The
value of salvage Coc-ky estimates as well over £5O.
* * * *
“Jacky Roo”: How far can a bush-fire
jump? Some years ago, when Lake George, in the
Bungendore district (N.S.W*.), had a fair amount of
water in it, the grass on one side got alight. The
fire, fanned by a strong wind, spread into the light
timber and jumped the lake to set fire to the other
side. Lake George at that point is a good two miles
across. Record ?
* * * *
“Eau-de”: Many people assume that the
carvings on aboriginal “letter-sticks” are legible
to the natives. During the past two years I have
collected many such “letters” on the Cape York
Peninsula, but in every instance the boys holding
them have explained that they conveyed no definite
meaning. For instance, a native a few hundred miles
down the peninsula, wishing to inform one of his
tribe in Thursday Island of some event, carves a
stick and passes it to a friend making in that
direction and gives him the message. The “letter”
may thus pass through many hands before it arrives
at its destination, but always the same message is
passed along with it. The “stick” is merely a
reminder, much like the string tied around White
Brother’s finger.
* * * *
“Dingo” : The most remarkable use of the
Great Australian noun that- I ever struck was at
Cairns (Q.), where I heard a wharfie begin “Ons
time, me an’ another blankard” ; I may add
that the tale was worthy' of the beginning.
STOCK EXCHANGE REPORT.
“Copper advanced briskly at the opening
“Fettler” : Thundering along in the dark,
a mixed train on the Bananaland North Coast recently
ran into a mob of jamtin-rribblers trespassing: on
the track. When the puffer pulled up for a drink
some 20 miles further on, one of the crew saw an
immense william-goat blinking and nodding at him
from the cowcatcher. It was the father of the
flock scattered about an hour before. Although the
old boy had the wind up properly, he didn’t appear
to be much hurt, and lost no time in getting a move
on when given the hint to go.
DARK IN THE SCRUB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The shoulders of the hills are stark.
Black shadows the deep gorges mark ,
The clouds are low, the sci'ub is dark.
The death-bird is abroad ; his cries
Rise like a murdered woman’s scream,
As though red life-blood was astream,
Gurgles and ebbs and slowly dies.
And all night long a ghostly sound—
The tapping of a coffin-bird—
Hammer on nails and wood, is heard
And ghostly echoes steal around.
The frightened saplings move and creep
Closer and fold their trembling leaves
As flying-foxes—loathsome thieves—
About the buds and blossoms sweep.
Their doglike teetli will rend and tear,
Their parchment wings will strike and’ break,
Spreading, with all they spoil and take,
A desolation everywhere.
A cockatoo shrieks eerily
A poignant note of awful dread,
Then flaps a moment and is dead—■
A carpet-snake is in the tree.
A warning gleams on sepia boles
And fiery scrolls creep on the earth ;
In rotting logs white flames have birth
And sparks glow red in roots and holes.
The long lianas twist and turn
Like serpents in a drunkard’s dream,
Wild whispers run, wild faces seem
In goblin lights to pale and burn.
Whiter than flame he comes to me
Down deathly aisles of fear and pain ;
He holds my shrinking soul again
Bidding me lift my eyes and see.,,,
The shoulders of the hills are grey,
The shadows move and melt away.
Beyond the night behold the day!

ESSEX TOURING
The main issue with Essex has
always been to give greatest value
for the money* Its fulfilment of
that aim was never so clear and its
sales supremacy so completely
acknowledged as to-day* With Hud-
son, it outsells every other line of
6-eylinder cars.
Economies possible only to the
largest production of 6-cylinder cars,
and exclusive patents no other
maker can share have resulted in
the best cars and lowest prices in
Essex history. Essex is built on the
Super-Six principle by Hudson work-
men in Hudson shops. No other
maker shares its advantage. In
quality Hudson and Essex are alike.
Both are easy riding and easy steer-
ing. Their unfailing reliability and
economy are known everywhere.
And their conspicuous and increas-
ing success reflects the rapidity and
completeness with which the real
facts regarding automobile values
have penetrated the entire market.

February’s sultry glow may keep even a
normal flapper away from a picture matinee,
but it won’t keep the frailest feminine
flower away from the display of advance
fashions. The ensemble suit is again the
most outstanding thing. This time it is
really a frock and a great coat, in the finest
of fine cloth, cut on strictly tailored lines,
with a flare and a swish about the abbrevi-
ated skirt, and a finish of fur. Such fur! It
makes one think that the whole Arctic king-
dom lias been going in for beauty culture.
The color in which Paris returns even our
“Plain Jane” little bunny is enough to make
the squatter’s pest quite uppish. Colors most
favored are greens, rust —all manner of
light henna tones —violets, and vermilion red,
so it looks as if we are going to have a color-
ful winter. Those-who can afford the mere
20, 30 or 45 guineas asked for the bit of
tailoring and beauty-cultured bunny will
brighten up the landscape for those who ean
afford merely the durable blue serge and
brown gabardine.
Historic Church Hill claimed one of the
most picturesque of the week’s many wed-
dings when Canon Bellingham and Rev. Leo
Charlton linked up Titian-haired Leila Moses
and Wallace Sawyer, the younger son of the
Matt Sawyers of Buloma station, Bethungra.
The bride is the elder daughter of Fred
Moses, who won fame as part-owner of
Poitrel, the Melbourne Cup winner. She
was a demure little figure in her ankle-length
old-world frock of point d’Alencon lace on
ivory georgette. The light corsage was
clasped to the full jupe with ivy leaves of
rhinestones. A tulle train edged with
d’Alencon was arranged from the shoulders
like our great-grandmammas arranged their
shawls, and the same diaphanous material
was folded tightly to her head and flowed
out into another cloudy train. There was
an orchid and stephanotis shower for sister
Ella to hold when the locksmiths gave the
signal. Ella had the assistance of the
’groom’s sister Nell and Sheila Brodie, in
peach-blossom taffetas. The wedding meats
were spread at the Wentworth, bride’s mother
bidding the guests welcome in a wonderful
creation of the new sable georgette and
silver lace. When the Wallace Sawyer
couple return from their honeymoon the
bride’s parents and sister Ella will set out
on a world-tour.
Apostles in blue and red looked down from
the high stained-glass windows in old St.
Andrew’s Cathedral on Shrove Tuesday as
a fair-haired young bride walked up the
centre aisle clasping father’s arm. Father is
Archbishop Wright and the pretty girl in
a foam of ivory gossamer and lace was
Norah. his second daughter, now Mrs.
Greville W. Warren. The tall hero of the
occasion, who hails from Hawkes Bay, in
Maoriland, is the eldest son of Major
Warren, of that pastoral area. Brides-
maidens Isobel Wright and Mary Warren
looked like twin stalks of deep blue del-
phiniums, with millinery to match and soft
garnishing of fuchsia velvet. The bride’s
veil, of lloniton lace, which had been worn
by a great-grandmother on her wedding day
was decked around the girlish head in the
form of a transparent cap, with a long cloud
of lace floating over a white tulle train.
After choristers had piped their sweetest and
Bishop Long had tied the knot, with a help-
ing hand from Canon Langley, the gathering
adjourned to Bishopscourt.
The Great Synagogue was thronged to
witness pretty little Marjorie Bloom, of
Bellevue Hill, made Mrs. Bernard Freeman,
of Melbourne, by Rabbi Cohen. The bride
being the elder daughter of the late Julius
Bloom, brother Harold handed over the
vision in white georgette, silver lame and
clouds of faint-pink tulle. Sister Billie.
Marjorie Freeman and Enid Abrahams
made a glowing vision in flame ninon sub-
dued by overdresses of apricot georgette.
Ruth Lyne, of Manly, and John Norton,
of Neutral Bay, kept hundreds of suburban
flappers late for dinner by having an early-
evening wedding at St. James’s. Traditional
white satin, with silver lace, was the happy
choice for Ruth’s bridal gown. Dorothy Web-
ster, Bonnie Broughton, and Nell Norton
attended her in frocks of watermelon-pink
georgette with borders of French blue and
velvet sashes of the same color. Bruce Berc-
kelman, Bert Grieve and Noel Smith escorted
them to Burdekiu House afterwards.
A double wedding at St. Mary’s Cathedral
held up the traffic, there were so many spec-
tators. Two pretty Inverell sisters, Ella
and Mary Murray, were linked to two Morce
’grooms. Ella became Mrs. William Murray
and Mary Mrs. Gerald Moore; and Dean
O’Neill journeyed from the North-West to
do the riveting. They were dressed alike in
classically-draped satin frocks, and wore
Limerick-lace veils. Sister Mona and Nell
Moore, in hydrangea and cyclamen georgette
frocks, were in attendance on both.
Of the week-end weddings one had a sport-
ing and one an inky interest. Pat McHugh,
the well-known sporting promoter of the
Western Suburbs, m’arried Sylvia Cousins
at St. Mary’s Cathedral. And Jack Goodge,
of the Sun, married Doris Smith, daughter
of J. J. Smith, of North Sydney, at St.
Stephen’s. The tall bride wore a frock of
honey-tinted georgette, and her pretty dark
head was crowned with a rose-tinted geor-
gette hat. Her sister Florence attended her.
There was a golden bride at St. John’s,
Darlinghurst, in the same silver twilight—
Molly, daughter fof the late W. Angus
Stewart, of Randwick. Clive Lupton, of
Waverley, claimed the vision in gold lame,
with a giolden tulle veil bound to her pretty
head by a golden bandeau, and a sheaf
of golden lilies in the crook of her arm.
But the city did not have all the wedding
fever. Marjorie, daughter of M. E. Hunt,
M.L.C., was married at the Mosman Metho-
dist Church to Bernard Howard by the
’groom’s father. The bride was in a silver
lame frock veiled in diamente and silver-
sequined georgette. A coronet of silver leaves
clasped her tulle veil, and she carried her
wedding flowers in a silver basket. Her
little nieces, Gwendoline and Lucy Firth,
kept her silver train out of the dust, and
Marjorie Creer and Beatrice Bruce were
fuchsia-clad bridesmaids. Nearly 200 guests
drank healths at the Anzac Memorial Hall.
The free concerts that drew so many musi-
cal lovers to Adyar Hall during lunch-hour
on Wednesdays last, year are, thanks to C.
V. Boult and a band of enthusiasts, to be
continued this year. The promoters have
planned a series of concerts with a purpose.
One programme will be given over to the
works of a composer, another to those of a
nation or a period; the production of scores
by Australian composers will be another
feature of the scheme. A Mozart programme
will set the ball rolling on March 3, and
Schubert, Mendelssohn, Beethoven and
Tschaikowsky concerts are promised, with
national and period programmes to follow.
From the door-collections it is hoped a per-
manent annual musical scholarship will be
made possible. Already one youth, ,T. Post,
is studying the ’cello at the Sydney Con. as
a result of last year’s takings.
Here’s pretty Mary Elliott, of Burwcod,
who uses a graceful and an active racquet
at the White
City courts.
She has played

state match is,
and has repre-

The committee will have to mother all the
blame if the Otranto Ball on March 1 does
not yield a robust cheque to the Hospital
Saturday funds. The Orient Co. is not only
lending the 20,000-ton floating hotel, but is
giving supper for 1000 people and throwing
in an orchestra of 25 performers.
Our own Sweet Nell of Old Drury is
going to revive the historic play for one
afternoon in April for the Radium Fund
of the Sydney Hospital; probably it will be
at the Royal, the scene of Miss Stewart’s
long triumphant season. Mrs. Osbourne Eng-
land presided at the meeting at the Australia
when a committee was formed to make the
forthcoming matinee a great financial success.
Gorgeous regalias paraded in Castlereagh-
street on Saturday for the laying of the
foundation-stone of the new r Sydney Masonic
Club, which, like most central Sydney
buildings nowadays, is to shoot 150 ft. into
the air. It is only 33 years ago that the
first Masonic Club in Sydney—and, inciden-
tally, so it is said, in the world—was estab-
fished in a humble way in Paddington, and
it was considered a great step when the Club
moved into the city a little oyer 15 years
ago; but the new building will make the
Pitt-street home look like a primitive cabin.
It will cost £lOO,OOO and contain bedroom
accommodation for members in its 1-
lofty storeys. The site is where, in years
before the horse was superseded, Ingfis s
Horse Bazaar flourished; citizens who now
park their cars elsewhere used to-stable there
the hacks they rode into town. The property
ran through from Pitt to Castlereagh, but
the Masons have sold the Pitt-street front-
age to Greg McGirr, ex-M.L.A., one of
Labor’s financial friends whose prosperity
seems to get fatter every year.
If Matron Pocock, of this May Moore pic-
ture, isn’t a war veteran, there is none. For
the intrepid nurse has been right through two
campaigns. She was a young sister with the
first contingent to go to the S’African W ar;
and October, 1914, found her a sister in
charge of a troopship making for Egypt.
She was on duty in January of 1915 in the
first war hospital at Ismalia, and after that
Alexandria, hospital-ship duty and the
Western Front claimed her till she was
made matron of Hartford, where so many
Diggers were put on the track to health.
Later on Lady Darnley’s Home for Austra-
lian Soldiers
—Cobham Hall
—was in her
charge. Matron
is the proud
possessor of a
whole cliestful
of medals, one
of which is
the Royal Red
Cross, and she
has been twice
mentioned in
d i s p a tc hes,
once by the
hard-to-
impress Kit-
chener himself.
Two fine
S’African
medals struck
in solid silver
have a warm
place in her
affections.
They remind her of those days—and some
of them lean to starvation —when the world
waited breathless to hear the fate of Bloem-
fontein, East London, Jo’burg, Ladysmith!
Riding through these memories are Lord
Roberts, Kitchener, Allenby and Botha. The
last she describes as a fine-looking man—
“impressive even beside Kitchener,” Matron
adds. She saw them as they were, parting
one morning after they had been discussing
terms of peace—negotiations that came to
nothing. It was months later that one
morning, after some heavy fighting, Matron,
walking through one of the wards, saw two
of the beds pushed close together and the occu-
pants holding hands as tenderly as the babes
in the wood. The one was a young Canadian
whose eyes had been shot away; the. other
was an enormous young Boer. The prisoner,
risking his shattered arm, had, during the
deepest hell of the Canadian’s night, pushed
his bed close enough to reach across the hand
of comradeship.
His Majesty Albert of Belgium has a train-
ing-ship in Australian waters, the L’Avenir.
She is now at Melbourne, and as it is not
yet decided whether she will visit Sydney,
Consul-General Segaert’s son Georges, who
is a cadet, came overland to visit papa,
mamma and the girls. The amiable Consul
Segaert went off on Sunday night to pay
his respects to his country’s naval represen-
tatives, so he may persuade them to come
and confirm the rumor of the beauty of Syd-
ney’s harbor. The Consul-General, by the
way, is again in the throes of another French
play. This time he will produce it for the
Alliance Francaise. It is to be a comedy,
“La Belle Aventure.” Henriette will act
with father, and Barbara Littlejohn, just
returned from abroad, is also rehearsing for
the exciting event, which is booked for the
Conservatorium on March 12.
There were plenty of cheers at the Domain
Baths on Saturday when Maoriland’s cham-
pion, Ena Stockley, wrested the 100 yards
championship oft Australasia from Continental
contestants, with another islander, Piri Page,
a good second. Vera Pawley, the N.S.W.
champion, led for 60 yards, and then fagged;
the smiling M.L. mermaids finished almost
fresh. Ettie Robinson, from whom so much
was expected, earned her triumph in the
diving championships. The sun-kissed Syd-
ney swimmer dived as gracefully as a sea-
gull. The visitors had a civic welcome just
after their arrival, and the S.L.A.S.C. gave
them a couple of parties, in moderation.
May Dexter, who relinquished control of
J. C. Williamson’s publicity department at
the year’s end to meander round Java, the
Malay States, China and Japan before visit-
ing brother Bob in America, was given tea
on the eve of leaving by the Tasman. The
metropolitan presswomen were hostesses.
May’s colleagues wished her God-speed
in the blue room of the Wentworth Cafe,
accompanying the wishes with a posy of red
roses and an enamel scentspray for her hand-
bag, as dainty as herself.
Real old-time Sydneyites will get an up-
rush of reminiscence at mention of Charley
Lett —“Handsome Charlie.” His daughter,
Mrs. Kell, was a passenger booked for Syd-
ney on a just-arrived liner; but she missed
it at Colombo.
Miss Emily Cox aud her sister, daughters
of the late Archie Cox, left by the Euripides
on Saturday for a long stay in Europe. Miss
Cox had been president of the Prisoners’ Aid
Association ever since Mrs. Arthur Lassetter
resigned the post in war-time; and her fellow
committeewomen gave her a travelling clock
as a gage of remembrance. The presenta-
tion was made at a charming afternoon-tea
at Culcairn, Mrs. W. A. Parker’s house at
Edgecliff.
Professor E. R. Holme, who will leave
by the Cathay to represent Sydney Uni. at
a conference to be held in Paris about the
middle of the year, was given a farewell lun-
cheon by members of the French community
at Paris House on Friday. Consul-General
Nettement was host, with Paul Bonnet,
president of the Alliance Frangaise. Unit
versity Registrar Walter Selle was also a
guest.
From an Australian in London:—
Melba’s friend Lady Susan Birch had an exhibition
of her shell flowers lately. All the specimens were
sold and many replicas ordered, the prices ranging
from 30 guineas to a few shillings. The chief exhibit
was an oak-tree made of mother-of-pearl and seed
pearls, and other specimens represented blossoming
trees and flowers of all kinds, the natural color of
the shell being variously tinted to complete the
illusion. Her brother, Claude York, a successful
miniature painter, has learnt the shell-flower making
from Lady Susan, and the little family coterie appears
to have hit on a very profitable idea.
Papua’s Governor Murray has just
brought forth another volume, “Papua To-
day.” The tall chief of the Fuzzy Kingdom
arrives in this port shortly on a few weeks’
furlough. His little lady, by the way, lately
won the D.T.’s camera prize for a scene from
her loved Terrigal rocks.
Miss Brisbane’s budget:-
Freda Bage, head of the Women’s College, who
spent her holiday in Melbourne, brings Ethel Bage
and Dorothy Denniss back in her car with her. This
trio of brains has been relaxing in Gippsland and the
city by the Yarra.
News comes from China of the serious illness of ex-
Govemor Matthew Nathan, who has been staying with
his brother and sister-in-law in the land of the
wild white rose. Latest reports were favorable.
St. Paul’s, East Brisbane, saw the tying of the
knot when Robert, younger son of Colonel and Mrs.
Wallace Brown, of Mosman, married Nita, younger
daughter of the T. McWilliams, Mowbray-terrace,
She wore ivory crepe Romaine, a court train finished
with Debe roses, and a double veil of silk net,
and she carried white roses. Jessie McWilliam and
Freda Stewart, in apricot, ’maided, with bouquets of
apricot and gold roses. Amidst pink carnations and
zinnias the McWilliams had a reception at Lennon’s,
Mrs. McWilliam wearing beige lace over amber; her
bouquet was of crimson roses.
A hot day brought out all the filmy frocks for
Ascot February meeting. On the committee-room
verandah Mrs. Isaac Moore poured tea in a navy
frock with touches of nasturtium-red on her hat;
Mrs. Dinsdale was in autumn-tinted knitted silk
with black picture-hat; Mrs. Whittingham in ivory
with maize and jade-green hat, and Mollie Brenan
in blue. Eva Lennon wore rose and ivory; Mrs. S.
F. McDonald, black and white.
Parties are being given for Mrs. Harry Mills,
who was pretty Hilma Ohman, and for her pal
Mollie Brenan, who accompanies her to the Cold
Country. Mrs. R. J. McNab gave one, with mah
jongg added, at her home at Wilton, Albion. Others
to go to the Land of Fogs shortly are Mrs. J. D.
Henry (who was Myee Feez), Miss BrentnaU and
Sara Wilson. For Miss Wilson, the W.C.T U. and
Y.W.C.A. have been spreading the traycloth.
Brass bowls of lilies and many guests welcomed
Rene Maxwell at Lennon’s when the Tivoli-Lanes
hostessed a party for the soprano. Mrs. Lane was in
brown with cream Viennese lace, and Rene wore ivory
mariette with touches of rose and blue, and a big
blue hat.
A big bell just placed in the temporary tower
of St. John’s Anglican Cathedral was brought from
England 50 years ago, and was first hung in a
wooden tower near what is now the C.I. branch
of the police. Seven smaller bells pealed with it.
The inscription on the big bell is “Gloria in excelsis
Deo. This peal of bells was procured by public
subscription in 1876.” A list of names includes those
of Charles Holmes A Court, who died recently in
England at an advanced age, and of Hamilton Scott,
familiar to early Queensland history. They were
on the parochial council.
Mrs. McDonald, the pride of Goondiwindi, sur-
vived her 108th birthday by only nine days; and
the town is in mourning. A great-grandchild was
the companion of Mrs. McDonald’s last years; and a
host of other great-children are scattered over
Queensland. On both his visits to Goondiwindi the
late Governor Nathan paid a visit to the centenarian.
It was such little acts that made Sir Matthew so
popular.

Phones central 1532, 1533.
Lots of people who journeyed to Caulfield
to peruse the second chapter of the
V.A.T.C.’s autumn serial wished they hadn’t;
for it was oppressively hot and favorites
showed no desire to justify themselves. Races
seem to have become purely a business pro-
position for women, and though the sex in
Melbourne is, like infants, lunatics and
proved spielers, legally forbidden to bet, it
gets there just the same, and has a bit on
anything it fancies. Clothes, though worn,
seem gradually to be receding into the back-
ground. The vice-regal households were
represented by the G.-G., Lady Stonehaven,
and retainers —her Ex. wearing mole geor-
gette ensemble with fitch collar, topped with
a bois-de-rose hat banded with velvet —Gov-
ernor Stradbroke, the Countess in black
filmy covering and crinoline millinery, and
son John Anthony. There was not the usual
great gulf fixed between the respective vice-
regal pens, the occupants of which frater-
nised quite happily. Either Society was
afraid of wilting, or reserving itself for the
V.R.C. meeting, for it was not represented
in much strength. Mrs. Frank Clarke, in
her favorite lilac hues, brought her daugh-
ter, whose frock of white-pleated ninon had
a linking of stripes in petunia and black,
and a cosmos pink felt hat. Mrs. Ward had
cobalt-blue flowers scattered upon her black
satin gown. A pair' of pals, Mrs. Weston
Pett and Mrs. Rogers Thomson, were well
groomed in black. Navy-blue georgette,
knife pleated, and an attuned straw head-
piece were Mrs. Fred Scarlett’s fancy. A
bonnie bunch of lassies included knight-
surgeon Syme’s daughters, Hope, just back
from Europe, displaying cool covering of
white, spotted with green and lace attach-
ment of the same shade. Gwen Tait was in
blue voile with a rustic hat embellished with
pink roses. Viola Ramsay had picture mil-
linery shading a frock of white lace over
black, and Sylvia Hennessy was wearing a
rose hat with a lingerie frock embroidered
in a hue to match.
This year’s polo tournament is a struggle
between South Australia and Victoria only,
other States putting forward no claimants
to the Australasian Gold Cup and the Strad-
broke Cup. Two Victorian teams carried off
the honors of the first day’s play at Moonee
Valley racecourse on Monday. The G.-G.
and Lady Stonehaven leavened a solid stra-
tum of Victorian pastoralists—the Jim Fair-
bairns, Gordon Chirnsides, Ronald Cum-
mings and so forth. Charming maidens were
there in scores, all in jumper suits with small
felt hats. Though the weather was gorgeous
and the play good the spectators were only
politely enthusiastic.
From the hills and the sea society comes
trooping back to town, and it looks as
though w T e were in for quite a cheerful Lent,
with numerous balls, a couple of garden-
parties, and theatrical fare of an extra-
special vintage.
The Majestic hardly knew itself for the
evening dress it wore when Elsa Stralia sang
between the flickers on Saturday night. Old
friends mustered in force to welcome the
singer and gave her a greeting “said with
flowers” that made quite an impressive show
on the stage. A giant horseshoe spanned
with a star, bearing “Stralia” picked out in
contrasting blossoms, was one of the most
striking of the exhibits. Over a hundred
admirers took part in an impromptu recep-
tion at the theatre, and then adjourned to
a supper, with trilling and tripping, at the
home of Elsa’s in-laws, the Neil Lawrances,
at Caulfield. Like the Junoesque Clara, the
soprano has been going in for weight-reduc-
tion, the treatment in her case being plenty
of walking, including some mountaineering.
The Moonee Valley Racing Club’s mid-
week meeting was one of those shows whose
social magnitude can best be expressed by
the late Mr. Euclid’s definition of a point.
It was the sort of occasion on which Mrs.
Member cheerfully lends her treasured bit
of pasteboard to Mrs. Over-tlie-way, who
finds the maid and the cook likewise spend-
ing the day in trying to pick winners. Mrs.
Ben Chaffey wore a small sapphire-blue
velvet hat above a frock checked in blue and
black, beneath a black crepe-de-Chine coat.
Mrs. J. 11. Hewison, just back from Colom-
bo, displayed crepe Romaine in floral effect
of grey and black, beneath a black wrap,
topped by a navy hat with touches of
gold and petunia velvet blossoms. With
her was the Swanson lady, with crystal
necklace sparking up black draperies
and crinoline headpiece. Mrs. Wally Mit-
chell sported the smartest of coats of navy
georgette, with fitch bordering its flare. Con-
stance Evans, who is not tripping in “The
Honeymoon Girl,” sought winners in a cape
ensemble suit of grey, with a dash of almond
green, her head-covering being a cross be-
tween a turban and a batliing-eap.
Was ever dedication made under such dra-
matic circumstances? On February 14, 1841,
Angus McMillan finalised his exploration of
whqt w 7 e now call Gippsland and succeeded in
reaching Port Albert. It was from the top
of a mount known as Tom’s Cap he caught
his first glimpse of the sea. Only those who
knew the Gippsland of 50 years ago can
appreciate the full size of the stalwart Scot’s
performance. On Sunday, Feb. 14 of this
year, about 300 residents in the district
met to- make a pilgrimage co Tom’s Cap.
coming from Yarram, Traralgon and other
settlements. As they pushed their way up
along the bush track they could see the omi-
nous glow of distant bush fires. The Cap
reached, there were brief speeches and a
motion that the spot be dedicated “to the
memory and in the name of the great ex-
plorer Angus McMillan,” and it was resolved
that a worthy memorial be erected thereon.
Then the return trip was made. The distant
fires had galloped apace and all the surround-
ing hills were now beacons to light the scene
of the simple ceremony. The cars were
rushed down in haste through dense smoke
that obscured the light. The little town of
Yarram was held in a belt of' fire, and soon
the glory that was Gippsland lay in ashes
and desolation.
Collection-boxes to aid sufferers through
the bush-fires are rattling on every street-
corner in Melbourne, and the magnitude of
the disasters as well as the dauntless heroism
displayed by some of the folk in the burnt-out
area has made a strong appeal to the heart
of the public. Black Thursday of 75 years
ago had 15 human victims. Our Blacker
Monday had 32.
The only adornment for the felt hat and
velvet hat of the moment is a brilliant orna-
ment or brooch imaging not one but several
animals or birds. The Ark is being ran-
sacked for the adornment of upturned brims.
A flight of swallows, a trio of ducks, two or
three elephants, cats, and even snakes wan-
der across the facade of the new millinery,
something after the style of a dado round a
nursery wall.
Melbourne glimpsed its first pair of Rus-
sian boots “on the hoof,” so to speak, last
week. Though the rest of her sex found
ninon none too light, the wearer tripped gaily
across Collins-street in a winter suit of dark-
green cloth, with a felt headpiece to match,
and long boots of grey, the tops of which
her skirt-hem caressed.
John D. Brownlee, whose portrait by La-
fayette here shown was taken in Australia
before the
Opera Com-
ique of Paris
claimed him as
its own, is a
citizen of Gee-
-1 o n g. He
studied in Mel-
bourne f o r
four and a half
years with
Ivor Bonstead,
and then went
to the Big
Smoke to get
a f urther
brushing up at
the hands of
Din li Gilly.
Shortly after
his arrival lie
entered into a
seven months’
contract with
the Op 6 r a
Comique, where he has appeared in several
operas with much success. Cables the other
day announced that he had a fortnight’s
release to support Dame Nellie Melba at
her farewell concerts in Scotland, and is
due to sing at Covent Garden in May. Be-
fore going abroad he walked off with the
grand championship and innumerable other
prizes at the South-street Eisteddfod. He
was the youngest competitor to achieve such
distinction. To commemorate his pupil’s
triumphs in Europe, Ivor Bonstead has?
founded the Brownlee Scholarship, which
gives two years’ tuition to the most pro-
mising candidate.
The frocks staged in “Daddy Longlegs”
at the King’s on Saturday, with Renee Kelly
as Judy, caused a flutter in every flapper’s
frame. Those featured by the trio of college
girls were of the high-waist, tight-bodice,
full-skirt order. Judy, when she sheds the
gingham of the John Grier home, sports
pink taffeta with net frills and pleated
niching; next there’s a poem in organdie
in shades of hyacinth and a flowered
shady hat in harmony; lastly, a modish
confection, flame-colored and flower-em-
broidered, with black satin connections, a
dinky little headpiece and a mammoth fur
muff. Dorothy Fane as Julia lias striking
apparel of emerald velvet, brown fur and
biscuit-colored hat, as well as some attrac-
tive primrose silk raiment. Phyllis Best
revolves in a frock of apple-green taffeta.
Another of pale blue has an apron effect of
black striped ninon. Then there is Beatrice
Day, wearing a matronly ensemble of ivory
cloth wfitli lines of black, and Margaret
Damer looking so charming as Miss Prit-
chard that in real life Jervis would never
have looked at Judy. A fawn georgette with
a dangling huge tassel, a jade necklace and
some fur lingers longest in the memory.
Melbourne’s art critics and patrons are
becoming interested in the work of Ernest
Buckmaster, who has been a student under
Bernard Hall at the National Gallery. Art
being long and
life short, the
y oung man
iias been get-
ting a living out
of sign-writing
while climbing
up the hill of
fame. He man-
aged to gain
most prizes of
his term at the
Gallery, an d
completed his
course six
months under
the specified
four years. His
c o m p e t ition
picture ror the
travelling scho-
larship to be
decided at the
end of this
year is already
painted. Though his work lias previously
been seen at the Victorian Artists’ exhibi-
tions, his first individual show is only now
being held at the Athenaeum Hall, and it pro-
mises to be a splendid financial success. The
trustees of the National Gallery have given
it a good send-off by purchasing a capital
study of an old kitchen for 35 guineas. The
picture of the artist here reproduced is a
self portrait: for Buckmaster’s ambitions in-
clude both portraiture and landscape.
A simple, fussless wedding was celebrated
at Scots’ Church when Florence, a daughter
of Dr. and Mrs. T. Shanasy, of, Camberwell,
stood up with Hector McPhie, a son of Alec
MePhie, of Toowoomba. The bride’s pretty
frock of biscuit-hued georgette, with em-
broidery in darker tones, was worn with
harmonising millinery. Only relatives par-
took of the following luncheon.
Dr. Victor Con rick and his wife, who
motored from Sydney for the marriage of
Myra, olive-branch of the R. F. Con ricks of
St. Kilda, to J. L. Hogan of Beulah, held a
tea-drinking in honor of the bride-elect at
the Wattle tea-rooms. The hostess topped
a black gown with crinoline millinery, and
Myra wore a frock of dull gold with a har-
monising hat. At church the leading lady
wore pink and silver, showing under a pink
tulle veil, and the two ’maids provided a
rainbow setting, in frocks of primrose hue
and golden-tinted hats embellished with
mauve flowers.
When Enid, elder daughter of the Clive
Kings, of Balaclava, promised to share the
joys of John Lloyd Roberts she held a
sheaf of pink and white lilies against a frock
of white georgette and Limerick lace, the
whole enveloped in the usual cascade of white
tulle. Sister Peggy and Rose Clapperton
’maided in mauve crepe de Chine with violet
millinery. The reception- and ball-rooms at
No. 9 Darling-street later glowed with pink
and mauve blooms.
The wife of the Harrison Moore knight
and the life-partner of Attorney-General J.
G. Latham joined forces to speed the de-
parture for Europe of Mrs. F. W. Eggleston.
The chattering (with coffee) was attended
by many of Melbourne’s handled dames,
some politically related, with a very small
sprinkling of the merely cultured. The
Lyceum Club opened all its folding doors to
accommodate the fashionable invasion and
disclosed decorations of pink-shaded gladioli
and lilies. By happy chance this roseate
background blended with the feted guest’s
frock of rose chiffon and crystal gleamiugs.
The State Governor’s lady, in a blue
ensemble suit and millinery of a Nattier
shade, opened the new obstetrical theatre
at the Women’s Hospital. Mrs. A. V. Ilis-
kens, who presides over the committee, gave
welcome to the vice-regal visitor, handing
her a bouquet of cactus-dahlias and roses;
and Doctors Marshall Allen and Allen
Robertson claimed the theatre to be one of
the world’s largest and best-equipped. Sing-
ing by Mrs. Ivroeff, Mrs. Fleming Dunstan
and tenor Walter Kirby enlivened the gather-
ing. And of course there was tea.
The Governor-General’s lady being patron-
ess of the Friendly Union of Sailors’ Wives
and Mothers, the annual council meeting was
held at Government House. Mrs. Hall-
Thompson, who presides over the union,
gave her Ex. a resiling of the doings of the
body. The Creswell lady, who has been on
the council, ivas raised by special alteration
of the constitution to the dignity of life-
president ; and Mrs. N. G. Musther, who has
watched over the finances since the union’s
infancy, received an outpouring of deserved
praise. Wives of two lately-arrived naval
officers, Mrs. Baillie Grohman and Mrs.
Graham Brown, were gathered into the fold,
and the proceedings ended in a grateful
clatter.
Sydney’s “Bishop” Leadbeater paused long
enough in this city to introduce the Arun-
aale couple at a social gathering arranged
in their honor at the Queen’s Hall, which
was filled to overflowing. Twenty years of
life and work in India have left their mark
on Arundale, but he is a man of parts, with
a gift of humor. His wife, born in Madras
of a liigli-caste Brahmin family, combines a
dazzling smile with a smart clothes-sense.
She has escaped the shingle and the abbre-
viated skirt craze, but her gown of gold tissue
had a French air and the size and brilliance of
her diamonds made Melbourne sit up and gasp.
Miniatures by Stella Lewis Marks were at
the New Gallery last week. The National
Gallery trustees made eyes at a striking por-
trait of a well-known ’Murkan, but it was
not for sale. Their choice may light upon
the now quite early-Victorian looking woman
with greying hair who, as Maud Allan in a
Salome dance, shocked her generation by
leaving off some clothing usually left on in
those days.
Captain Keppel Palmer, who is still on
the Government House staff, takes his lately-
acquired bride to England next month.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer presided over the tea-
pot at the Lyceum Club the other after-
noon, when the committee of the Alliance
Franqaise said au revoir to the wife of Leon
Jona, who is off to Europe with her family.
The auxiliary of the Alfred Hospital also
had a mustering of workers at which fare-
wells to Mrs. Jona were shared by Mrs. W.
J. Fookes, vice-president, and Sara Levi,
who also have their passports in order for
travel. The president, Mrs. Kupert Wilkes,
handed over some flowers that expressed the
good wishes of fellow-workers for the Alfred.
Mrs. Arthur Morton and Mrs. Fleming Dun-
stan raised their voices in song above a
subdued tinkling of teaspoons on china.
June Elvidge, when she gives up being
Aladdin’s best girl at His Majesty’s, will
return to the land of her birth, whose fillums
gave the lady her introduction to this con-
tinent.
Sister Adelaide tells of warm times: —
The bush-fires in South Aus., although among the
worst the State has known, were happily without loss
of life. Interest centred mostly on the village
of Mount Pleasant, 30 miles from Adelaide, where
the flames came in and destroyed the rectory.
Wealthy men with stud sheep suffered heavily,
notably Robert Melrose and Murray Dawson. There
was another bad fire in the Glare district, where
Duncan Hughes, of the Federal Reps., only just
saved the old family home. Another outbreak behind
Willunga worked in close to the Kuitpo pine-forest,
but patrols and fire-breaks saved it.
The nucleus of a fire-relief fund existed in (he
shape of a balance from the Bush Fires Relief Fund
of 1912. A Government cheque has been added and
private subscriptions are dribbling in.
From England comes news of the engagement
of Margaret Judge, for a time at Government House
on the Bridges’ staff, and then managing a dress
and millinery venture. She returned to England
in the Nestor, and the ship’s doctor —Marsh by name
—is the hero of the romance.
We’ve had a wedding too —-she Geraldine, daughter
of the J. A. Hymans of Karoona, and he a son of
Alfred von Doussa, who for innumerable years ran
the Onkaparinga Racing Club. There were four
rainbow-clad bridesmaids and a small train-bearer
for the white and silver bride.
The Gallery Fine Arts Committee has eaten a slice
of humble pie and asked Van Raalte for a report
on the deterioration of some of its pictures and the
best method of preserving them. A permanently
open entrance, too much sun on certain walls and
a damp crypt lie cites as the chief faults; and as he
was three years at the Gallery he may be presumed
to know what he is talking about. He adds a rider
urging care in the choice of a restorer.
Died at Glen Osmond, after a long illness, Mrs.
Ernest Whitington, wife of the chief-of-staff of the
Register. After the death of her first husband,
H. V. Pridmore, she carried on the Woodley vine-
yards and cellars, and to business abilities added
a sympathy and generosity that made her one of
the most beloved women in the district.
Clara Serena and Clifford Lathlean write enthusi-
astically from London of kindnesses shown to Austra-
lians. Serena and her husband (Roy Hellish) have
decided to stay on for at least another year, and
Clifford Lathlean will make his home altogether on
the other side. Ada Crossley has been specially kind
to him.
Miss MacDonald, who takes the Presbyterian College
for Girls under her wing, has a good word to say for
the modern young feminine person. “Bigger minded
than her predecessor, and anxious to make her life
count. A little hard, perhaps, on moral obliquity,
and a little lacking in the graces of life.” The
Methodist Ladies’ College is building itself a new
wing, with chapel, assembly hall, class rooms, and
laboratories and what-not. The cost is set down at
£30,000.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Time was when Australian-bred stayers
and middle-distance horses could hold their own with
the cream of the English thoroughbreds of their day
—witness Merman, Newhaven, The Grafter, Georgic
and Australian Star —but after Top Gallant’s per-
formance, with lOst. 21b. atop, in the V.A.T.C.
Futurity Stakes it is clear that our Heroics and
Manfreds would be only second-raters in England.
A Maoriland jockey wrote from the Cold Country
that Gloaming wasn’t within 2st. of the best Eng-
lish form ; his assertion was ridiculed, but evidently
he wasn’t far out. Pantheon and Tarquin having
been withdrawn on the course, there were 15 runners
for the Futurity Stakes, and Top Gallant was favorite
at 3 to 1 (he was backed from tens), with Heroic
and Manfred at 9 to 2, Fuji San and Wordsworth at
tens, Mercian King, Laveuse and Wai-Lu at twenties,
and the others from 33 to 100 to 1. Heroic and
Manfred were, as always, nasty at the post, and when
the machine lifted they were the last to leave. But
if they had got a flying start they could not have
beaten Top Gallant, who, notwithstanding his No. 15
marble, dashed to the front, and at the six furlongs
was well clear, Amontillado, Bairn, Fuji San and
Wordsworth being nearest of his pursuers. The im-
ported horse was four lengths to the good along the
side, where the race was over. Galloping beautifully,
he passed the post four lengths in front of Fuji San
‘—Bracken, who rode him, could have made it. a
dozen—with Manfred a length behind Fuji San and
Mercian King fourth, just ahead of Heroic. Top
Gallant made the cracks behind him look like down-
the-liners. A powerful-looking six-year-old chestnut
stallion by Swynford—Galante, he is owned by A,
P. Wade, and trained in Victoria by Lou Robertson,
who has been very successful with English horses.
The time, Imin. 26jsec., was a record for the race.
For the Woodeliff Handicap, 11 furlongs, Suomi
was favorite at 7 to 2, with Aecarak at fours, Beau
Fils at sixes, Belgamba at eights, Lemina and Valbee
at tens and Woolpack at twenty-fives. The last-
named was in front most of the way, but Beau
Ids, judiciously ridden by Duncan, caught him in
the straight and won brilliantly by a length and a
half from the jumpers’ flat horse, with Valbee, who
finished well, a head away and Spearage fourth.
The winner, an imported horse by Son-in-Law—Vivid,
had run a good race in the Bond Cup the previous
Saturday. He is owned by Norman Falkiner and
trained by Jack Holt, and has 7st. 91b. in the
Australian Cup—he carried Bst. 21b. in the Wood-
eliff. The time, 2min. 191 see., was another course
record.
E. M. Pearce’s colt Valaisian was all the rage
for the Alma Stakes for two-year-olds, starting at
sto 2 against; but although he came with a great
run after getting a bad passage, he failed by a
length to catch the Woorak —Mettlesome colt Crom-
well (eights), who led most of the way. Sarpedon
(tens) was a close third. The winner is owned by
C. Meyers and trained by L. J. McCann. Honest
Waranton (3 to 1) ran a sterling race under his
9st. nib. in the Hawksburn Handicap and scored by
half a length from Prince Tressady (sevens), who
finished fast, with Ambassador (twenties) a close
third and Valiard (sevens), who will be improved by
the run, fourth. Waranton, who galloped the six fur-
longs in lmin. 14sec., has 9st. 4lb. in the Newmarket.
Like others of the St. Antons, he has improved with
age.
All going well with Top Gallant, he ought to take
out next Saturday’s V.R.C. Newmarket Handicap,
seeing that the weight will be the same as he
made light of in the Futurity. If he is destined
to go under, Versine (Bst. 21b.), a good two-year-old
who has trained on, or Lady Thrill (6st. 121 b.) mny
reward their backers. Lady Thrill’s second in the
Oakleigh Plate was a capital performance, as
Waranton has since shown.
For the Australian Cup Pilliewinkie (9st. 61b.),
Aecarak (Bst. 121 b.), Beau Fils (7st. 91b.), Belgamba
(7st. 131 b.) and Highlander (7st.) read best. Bel-
gamba, a fair three-year-old with recent form to
recommend him, is nicely treated, and the race may
go to him or Highlander, who has been galloping
encouragingly at Randwick.
* * * *
Declining a belated invitation to go to Mel-
bourne and ride The Hawk in the Futurity Stakes,
Jimmy Pike had three mounts at Warwick Farm
(N.S.W.) on Saturday, and his score was two
winners and a third. He had an easy time on Sea-
plane (threes), a very promising son of Biplane—
Graftolene, in the Ingleburn Nursery, but to get
home on Cajole (threes) in the Minto Handicap he
had to exert all his powers. With a f.a.q. horseman
on top, Kelso’s Ally would have been no match for
St. Eaton (threes), but having the services of a
really great jockey, she beat the Eaton Lad gelding
by a neck. In the intervening 10-furlong handicap
Pike piloted Greendale (sixes), who was a good third
to Duet (eights) and Samoan (5 to 2) ; Duet’s
superior cleverness at the turns enabled her to defeat
Samoan, but there was very little in it. Inasmuch
as four of the seven winners were favorites and
the others were eight-to-one shots, punters fared
pretty well; in fact, the Farm is living down its
reputation of being a pencillers’ paradise.

“Bris”: The Queensland Turf Club has
followed the example of the A.J.C. in forbidding
bookmakers to pick and choose the races they bet
on; they must not stand down for any race without
the permission of the stewards. The new rule was
badly needed in Brisbane, where McShortodds does
as much punting as bookmaking. The smaller fry
not only pick their races; they also pick their horses,
making a book for the favorite or second favorite and
refusing to lay anything else which appears to have
a chance. If they inadvertently take a bet about a
horse which turns out to be a trier they immediately
lay it off.' The Brisbane ring is a poor old thing,
and althoua'h the sporting scribes write up thrilling
stories of horses being backed for thousands at
ordinary meetings it simply can’t be done.
* * " * *
“Machete” : The distinguished visitor, being
buzzed through the country as fast as his well-
rhea ning guides can take him, misses a lot of im-
portant points. Witness Lord Burnham, of the
recent Press embassy, who has been trying to refute
the charge that Australians are gambling addicts.
He says that, whereas gambling in England is con-
ducted secretly at street corners and in public houses,
“most of the betting in Australia is conducted on
racecourses”; also that “betting loses much of its
evil when carried out so attractively and unashamedly
as in Australia.” One could almost wish Burnham
had given one of our million or so s.p. agents a
chance to sting him. He would probably have cut
the “attractively” out of his appreciation, even if
he left the “unashamedly” in.

The suspicion that Harry Collins (lOst.
11-Jib.) was only a champion among third-raters was
confirmed at the Sydney Stadium on Saturday night,
when Collins was well beaten by Len Johnson (list.
3jib.), the Manchester negro. Certainly the Aus-
tralian was sin. shorter as well as sflb. lighter, but a
real champion would have done a lot better. The
black sent over a right to the temple in the first
round, and the white had a lot of trouble to bluff the
round out. After that' he took a lot of punishment,
especially from the Johnsonian left. He had heard
that the black was weak in the midship section, but,
like the late Peter Jackson, Len must have trained
especially to strengthen those parts, for Collins’s
blows on the ribs and mark had no perceptible
effect on him. Realising that he was a long way
behind on points, Harry sailed in for a knockout
as they started the 20th, but was very nearly knocked
out himself. Johnson whipped a right across that
caught him on the chin. A less game man would
have gone down, and maybe stayed down, under
what Collins endured for two whole minutes there-
after ; but, by clinging, guarding and occasional
spurts of hiting, he saw the round out. The black
got the decision. A skilful boxer, with a lightning
right and a wicked, snappy hook —almost an uppercut
—with the left, he is undoubtedly the best man Eng-
land has sent us for many a year. All the same,
he backs and claims too much, while he has a bad
habit of violently shoving his man off. On one
occasion he fairly hurled Collins th’;s from ring-

centre to ropes. The contest was alleged to be for
“the middleweight championship of the Empire,”
and the takings amounted to £2468, of which each
man’s share was a fourth.
“Block and Counter”: I read that another member
of the Johnson family is coming to Australia with
a guarantee of five contests in Stadium rings. Within
the last few months this remarkable country has
been called upon to support the American negroes
“Tiger” Payne, “Sunny Jim” Williams, “Eagle”
Thomas, “Panama” McGale and “Shenandoah Shuffle”
Joe Hall. Likewise the Filipinos Jamito, Adriano,
Deleon, Fernandez, Flores and the Lord knows how
many more. Apart from Johnson and Fernandez,
and perhaps Deleon, these colored bruisers are not
in the same street as Australian pugs of the same
poundage, yet they get the pick of the Stadium dates
and send no inconsiderable amount of money out of
a country which needs every penny it can scrape
together. “Looking across this ring,” said a Stadium
ringsider the other night, “is like peering down a
tunnel,” and the gibe was warranted. The mass of
colored labor is imported (mostly because it is cheap)
by a syndicate at the head of which is the Labor
party’s wealthiest patron; and a quorum of Labor
Parliamentarians could be collected at the Stadium
any Saturday night. And, so far from the “workers”
objecting to the business (although there would be
howls of rage if a contractor proposed to import a
few colored bricklayers or carpenters under contract),
the working-class section of the Stadium crowd in-
variably barracks for the black man in a magpie-
match. Yes, this is a remarkable country.
SYDNEY SMITH, jun., manager of the
1926 Australian XI—or XVI.
Brilliant boxing characterised the return
match between Billy Grime (Bst. 12§1b.) and Ignacio
Fernandez (Bst. 7ill).) at Melbourne Stadium. In
spite of his disadvantage in weight, the little Filipino
carried the fight to his opponent, but a lot of his
punches landed outside the scoring area, and still
more were cleverly evaded. The tenth round was
notable for Grime’s effective countering, some heavy
rights shaking the brown man. From this stage
Grime was the master, his clean punching and
cleverness in evasion giving him a long lead on
points. In the 19th round, Fernandez was hard
pressed, but after emerging from a clash with a
badly-cut eye, he was lightly dealt with by Grime
until the finish, when the Australian champion was
crowned. Grime deserved his success, especially as
he was the victim of a bad decision in the'first
bout.

Australia hasn’t had a first-class girl-
swimmer since Fanny Durac-k retired, and the race
for the 100 yards championship at Sydney Domain
Baths made it abundantly clear that Maoriland form
is superior to ours. There was a brisk feminine
argument before the start, the management having
provided only six lanes for seven swimmers ; but, when
that was over, Vera Pawley (N.S.W.) shot away
with the lead and kept it until Ena Stoekley
(MX.) put in a winning spurt at 75 yards. Ena’s
fellow - Maorilander Pin Page was a fast-finishing
second and Vera a fair third. Rough water and tide
had an effect upon the speed, the time being lmin.
9sec., which is considerably short of the lmin.
5 4-5 sec. put up by Mariechen Wehselau, and of
Fanny Durack’s lmin. 6 1-5 sec., the record for an
Australian. Ettie Robertson, who was a very in-
different fourth in the 100 yards, won the diving
championship handsomely.

“Harold Hardupp”: Most of the skippers
of the Port Jackson six-footers, which held a “cham-
pionship” on Saturday, are youngsters, but there
are a few hardy old sailors who like sitting upon
what to the unsophisticated resemble small tubs
bearing a mast and a comparatively enormous .stretch
of canvas. They reckon it the only real sport in
sailing—which, in any case, is the best of all sports.
One of them, capsized, had got his midget craft
inshore when a 14-footer passed him with a hail:
“Never mind. Dad! We’ve got room for one on
board, here. What about coming?” Dad gave their
craft a withering glance. “None of your ocean-going
liners for me!”-he snorted.

S.A. rowing clubs all along the Murray
have been greatly stimulated by the prowess of
Murray Bridge. The State’s champion race, even
though held on the salt water of the Port Adelaide
river, went to Renmark, comfortably. Murrav
bridge, which did not seem its old self, finished
third, Torrens separating the two Big River boats.
Beni, another Murray club, was also represented,
and Mannum sent a four for other events.

‘‘S. Gumm”: In a great tennis week for
France, Suzanne Lenglen defeated Helen Wills
(6—3, B—6)8 —6) at Cannes, and Borotra licked Tilden
(13—11, 6- —3) in the U.S. indoor championship
at New York, while Brugnon vanquished Hunter
a former titleholder (6—4, 6—4), and Lacoste, the
ultimate winner, overwhelmed Richards (6 —4,
6—2). The customary excuses were made —by
Suzanne for her “awful” play (the ladv had previ-
ously distinguished herself by bursting into tears
when a linesman gave a decision against her) and
by Tilden’s tribe of apologists, who attributed his
failure to the harmful effects of picture-acting, or
something of the sort. However, Helen Wills said
nothing in extenuation of her defeat, her only
comment being that “Miss Lenglen proved just as-
good as I thought she was.” Helen is a strangely
modest devotee of a pastime which has an un-
fortunate tendency to inflate the head. Apropos,
the A.L.T.A. Council has decided not to send a
Davis Cup team abroad this year, the main reason
being a shortage of funds. There would be funds
enough if one particular band of tourists had not
done itself so proud in the matter of expenses as to
convert what was expected to be a substantial
surplus into a deficit. During a general discussion
on Davis Cup pilgrimages and the encouragement
ol young racquet-wielders, it was stated, with only
too much truth, that senior players were too high

Dunedin (M.D.) on Saturday, J. V.
Scholz, the U.S. sprinter, won a 22(Dyard race in
-1 2-5 sec., which is an Australasian record. The
previous best time on a ring track was Queenslander
Norman Grehan s 21 3-5 sec., made in Brisbane three
years ago; in a straight run at Adelaide “Slip” Carr
rfjj , e distance in 211 sec. Scholz shares with
Paddock the world’s record of 20 4-5 sec., established
at New York in 1925. His partner, Hahn, won the
mile at Dunedin in 4min. 37 4-5 sec. At Masterton
, e same day Maorilander Randolph Rose was
clocked to run a mile in 4min. 18 1-5 sec., and an
Australasian record is to be claimed on his behalf,
in the. Yic. championship at Melbourne, George
jD’de, in whom the Victorians think they have a
future Olympian, won by 60 yards in 4min. 22 l-ssec.
Nurmi’s, best time is 4min. 10 2-5 sec.
“North Island”: Maoriland will not easily forget
Hahn s second meeting with Rose at Athletic Park,
\\ ellington. The occasion was a mile handicap race,
in which Rose and the American were on scratch.
There was a boisterous wind. Hahn started to
sprint 400 yards from home, having sheltered behind
Rose’s large frame during the first three-quarters of
a mile. Rose was quickly in pursuit, and the pair
went through a mob of handicap men like sand
through a sieve. At the finish they had to run
straight into the eye of the wind, and the Maori-
landcr’s great strength and stamina pulled him
through. He not only beat Hahn by a good eight
yards, but won the race, pipping the speediest of the
handicap men right on the post. The crowd went
mad and a deliriousi mob nearlv killed Rose out of
sheer affection! and joy. The time, 4min. 26 2-ssee.,
reads slow, but the wind was a hummer. There is
tremendous interest in the deciding race, which,
barring accidents will take place on Feb. 27.

“Leg-bye”: The fact that 16 cricketers
and a manager are now considered necessary for a
tour of England reminds me that Billy Murdoch’s
1884 band had only 12 players and a manager.
All 13 lent a hand during the tour; the manager,
George Alexander, was second (to Blackham!) in
the bowling averages with 2 for 24. That was the
team which made the then unprecedented score of
551 v. England at Kennington. Oval. England
tried 11 bowlers: when the regular trundlers had
been knocked all over the place, Alfred Lyttleton
doffed the wicketkeeper’s pads, and took four for 19.
Murdoch’s 211 is still the record individual innings
by an Australian in Test cricket.
* * * *
“G. 0.8.” : Ago cannot dull the keenness
and skill of A. Kenny. For a score of years Kenny
has been the most versatile cricketer in his district,
and now, almost 50, he is still Stoush Melbourne’s
best all-rounder. Sixteen years ago he joined the
select band of five who have made two centuries in
one match for Victoria by hitting up 164 and 100
n.o. against Queensland. On Saturday he showed he
had not lost the century habit by scoring 132 n.o.
against Carlton. For a forlorn hope there is no
better pennant bowler. When all other tricks have
failed, he sometimes dismisses the set batsman with
a ball suddenly delivered five or ten yards behind
the crease, or with a donkey-drop tossed to an unusual
height. Decades ago he and a twin brother both
played for the venerable Stoush Melbourne Footballers
XI. In a stern game against Brunswick he brought
victory in sight wdth a century, a.nd then made the
game certain by ringing himself in as his twin
and banging up another 10'0.

“Past Grammar”: The Cricket
Association has again resolved to baek Queensland’s
application for admission to the Sheffield Shield
contests, Victoria is also willing, and there are
hopes that. S. Aus. objections, which are on the score
of the time occupied by away-from-home matches, the
capital quality of Queensland cricket being freely
conceded, will be overcome. It is suggested that the
two widely separated States should play only one
match against each other annually, visiting Brisbane
and Adelaide in alternate years. The original Sheffield
Shield ring has full power to make necessary altera-
tions in the constitution, so a points scoring system
to meet the changed conditions could be arranged.

A. C. Wallace, the N. S. Wales Rhodes
scholar, whose performances as a Rugby Union
three-quarter in Britain have brought him more pub-
licity than his good work in the schools, returned
to Australia last week. Hee was called to the Bar
in England, and is to practise in Sydney. A finished
three-quarter back before he left Australia, Wallace
did great things in the Rugby game for Oxford and
Scotland, which country of great three-quarter backs
he represented consistently during his stay over the
water. He will play for one of the Sydney clubs
during the winter, and should be a tower of strength
for N.S.W. against the All Blacks.

Shell gives regular employment
to considerably more than 2.000
employees in Australia.
Shell employs more British
capital, more British workers,
and more British ships in pro

ducts than any other oil company.
The system of distributing motor spirit in bulk
INITIATED BY SHELL first in the capital
cities and then in all the main country centres-is
now saving motorists over £500,000 per annum. With
the completion of additional facilities for bulk distribu-
tion and kerbside pumps particularly in the country the
direct saving to motorists will considerably increase.
Shell has applied its resources to reducing in every
possible way the cost of motoring in Australia, while,
at the same time, setting and maintaining a standard
of quality unequalled in the world

The Drawing Takes Place in the Sydney Town Hall on May 13, 192&
THE INKY WAY.
Died recently in London, Reginald Hodder,
one of Maoriland’s few native-born novel-
ists. He went to England, where some of
his books were published. “A Daughter of
the Dawn,” with a Maoriland setting, was
the most popular.
“Baiala”: Of the numerous free sheets
that have sprung into existence in Sydney’s
suburbs during the past three years only
a fraction survive. The registration list
shows that less than 20 of the 150 registered
are now in existence. . But there is still
more than a tidy living in, a few of them,
The death of H. B. Lassetter recalls a
period when so much verve w r as put into the
advertising columns of the daily papers that
suburban Sydney each morning turned first
to those sections which, set forth the price
of frills. It was the just-dead Lassetter, com-
ing to the command of the firm, who ordered
the offensive, the enemy being the Anthony
Hordern house, which in the adjacent column
returned a hot tire to a barrage of sarcasm.
It was a great time for the journalist free-
lances, who found that for once in a way
irony had a ready and profitable sale. The
casus belli was the Hordern claim to be the
“Only Universal Providers.” The war died
out when the head of Lassetter’s, who started
life as an officer in the British Army, went
off to the South African War in command of
the N.S.W. Mounted Rifles. Incidentally,
he got the C.B. and a medal with five clasps
out of that affray.
“Morehead”: Ernest Osborne, one of the
most prolific of N.S.W. Bookstall novelists,
has crowded plenty of adventure into his
50 years. Born in the West Indies, he went
to sea at 14, sailing for many years under
several flags and on more oceans. He has
varied trading in the South Sea Islands
with plantation management, and the ship-
ping of phosphate and copra, and his range
of experiences in tropical Australia is a
wide one. Since 1922 he has been connected
with the Sydney section of the Trade Press
Proprietary, Ltd., which runs a chain of trade
journals on subjects from furniture to
chemistry. Osborne helps to give Tiie Bul-
letin’s “Aboriginalities” its unique place in
“nature” literature, and Fijian and American
newspapers are among others to which he
contributes. His side-lines include the study
of economic entomology and schemes for the
more efficient loading of ships. At present
lie is condensing his experiences and obser-
vations into six volumes.
“H.W.S.”: An “Inky” paragraph (B.
4/2/’26) debits novelist 11. G. Wells with ‘ a
short and sharp, not to say rude and offen-
sive, way of choking off correspondents,
and instances a snub received by Ex-
Chief Justice Stout (M.L.) for trying to
correct what he considered an error of
zoology in the “Outline of History.” That is
not my experience of Wells. A remark in
the “Outline” to the effect that alcoholic
drinks were probably not invented until
man reached the agricultural stage of civil-
isation impelled me to bring to the author s
attention the case of the Tasmanian blacks,
who brewed a drink with a double-barrelled
kick in it from the sap of the cider-gum. 1
received a courteous letter in reply. Later
I put my ideas of how alcohol first came
to be discovered into a story which The
Bulletin published under the title of
Nectar of the Gods.” A copy sent to \velis
was answered by another letter and a copy
of one of his books inscribed “H.W.S. and
11. G. Wells, two waders iff a sea of ink.
“Hamer”: There is more than one way of
boosting a new book in Australia. My col-
lection of short stories, “The Search for the
Bonser Tart,” published in a paper-covered
Is. 6d. issue, sold right out in quick time,
and it wasn’t till I approached the publisher
on the subject of a second edition that 1
learned the bitter truth. I owed my vogue
entirely to an expert street salesman. IM
book contained merely straightforward,
honest stories; but the title lent itself to
manipulation. The salesman would sidle up
to his mark, furtively produce the book, and,
whispering “Hot stuff!” effect a quick sale
more often than not, the purchasers hastily
hiding the book in their pockets. M hen no
more copies were available, the salesman
went round the retail bookshops aiul bough
up all lie could secure at the full price. Then
he pasted a 2s. Cxi. tag over the Is. 6d. .and
renewed his blandishments. I met him later,
when he was grumbling at the absence ot
supplies; and he suggested, with something
like enthusiasm, that if I was getting ou
another book a good title would be “Lottie s
Lingerie.”

‘‘European newspapers are recording every move-
ment of Mile. Lenglen and Miss Helen Wills, the
American tennis queen. One paper declares that
Suzanne is very fond of chicken, while Miss Wills
is said to devour buckwheat cakes.” — Brisbane Daily
Mail.
Now make the busy presses Imm,
And cable wide the wonder;
What recks it, Lord, if wrath should come
Of Mussolini’s thunder?
High Heaven itself this message shakes
(So let the war-clouds thicken) —
How Helen pines for buckwheat cakes,
While Suzanne runs to chicken.
What though the sterner prophets prate
Of woe the world to smother?
What though a dull class-conscious hate
From brother sunders brother?
Oh, small the noise that such news makes,
But pulses leap and quicken
To hear of Helen’s buckwheat cakes
And eke of Suzanne’s chicken!
At times I dream in sore dismay
Of heavy type, black-bordered,
And special editions on the day
When, to a world disordered,
Co’ cs word ’fore which the bravest quake 3,
Dread news the ladies sicken —
Sweet Helen sick of buckwheat cakes,
And Suzanne stuffed with chicken.
Too plainly journalistic duds,
Compared with such sensations,
Arc wars and strikes and fi.res and floods,
The small affairs of nations;
But, Lord, this form my longing takes—
To see, ere I be stricken,
Dear Helen.... swamped in buckwheat cakes,
And Suzanne... .fried... .like chicken!

Leon Gordon’s “White Cargo,” produced
at the Sydney Royal on Saturday, is
built upon “Hell’s Playground,” a novel
written by Ida Vera Simonton, who, being
a lady, was able to put hysterical exaggera-
tion into the remittance-man’s pessimistic
view of life in the tropics. The play is tinged
with melodrama, but, granted its extrava-
gances, provides a well-constructed plot witli
opportunities for intense acting. On Satur-
day, the hot night assisted the players to
give a vivid idea of the West AMcan
stewpot, where the “damp-rot” eats into
everything, including the mind. Into this
hotbed of fever, where the few lonely whites
are tortured by the conditions until they hate
one another, steps a new man, Langford,
fresh and clean-suited, with a determination
to resist the deteriorating influences. His
idealism rasps the frayed nerves of the em-
bittered Witzel, who has endured seven foetid
years in a grim determination to last the
full ten which will return him to England
and affluence; and his cynical assertion that
Langford will drift on the same course as
others makes a two-sided hatred that creates
no improvement in conditions. Langford’s
hatred of Witzel increases as he feels that he is
drifting; and although he allows his clothes
to become as filthy as those of the others and
forgets his intention of keeping himself vigor-
ous by hunting, he yet tries to prove Witzel
wrong by remembering to shave (when he
is likely to meet the cynic) and resisting the
advances of the French half-caste Tondeleyo
—the only woman in the play—who, having
lived with practically every white man on
the coast, claims the newcomer as her own.
When the pull of sex as a relaxation from

Will Whilburn explains that married men do
not live longer than single men —it only

as of old.
the torturing monotony becomes too strong,
it is the remembrance of the sneers of
Witzel, who says that morals are a matter
of “longitude and lassitude,” that makes
Langford determine to marry the girl; and
marry her he does, though even the mission-
ary, Roberts, advises that the simple “marry
palaver” would be better. When Tondeleyo,
bored to death by life with a man who never
beats her, but scared by what a derelict
medico has told her about the inviolability
of the marriage bond, makes a bid for free-
dom by substituting poison for quinine, it
is Witzel who saves the man with whom he
lias been at war. He forces the “medicine”
down the throat of Tondeleyo, and per-
emptorily orders the captain of a steamer
to hurry Langford away to hospital at Lagos
—his white cargo—without waiting to put
any rubber in his holds. The curtain falls
upon Witzel’s bitter reception of another
white-suited novice who taljks glibly, as
Langford did, of hunting, clean-living and
becoming “acclimatised.”
* * * *
It is a few years now since a prim world
was shocked by hearing the great Australian
adjective in a play. Shaw’s venture seems
absurdly coy beside the language used in
this drama, in which the familiar adjective is
a commonplace; yet it loses a good deal of
its offensiveness because it seems to come
natural to the characters and the circum-
stances. The ultimate revelation of some
good—except in the half-caste negress, who
is purely animal—in the fever-distorted char-
acters is atonement also for an unpleasant
theme; and the acting (although there was
an early tendency to over-act) was on a high
plane. Wallis-Clark, as the sympathetic
medical derelict who still pursues the whisky
which has made him an outcast, and Leon
Gordon, as Witzel, have the chief opportuni-
ties. Gordon makes rather more than should
be made of them when he thumps the chest
of Langford (Austin Coghlan) to emphasise
his melodramatically-delivered arguments
against the marriage; that repeated thump-
ing, one fancies, should have caused reprisals,
seeing the feeling existing between the men.
Almost as bare as a Sydney surf siren, Helen
Stransky gave Tondeleyo realism; and a
couple of colored performers assisted the
atmosphere.

Loure, a new Sydney Tivoli arrival,
handles a violin for which he has selected
from the classics lightly flamboyant melo-
dies to match his harlequin dress. It is a
concert act agreeably made to fit vaudeville
conditions. Dainty Katrina and Joan give
a series of dances in which the lady who is
Joan gathers most applause for the “Danse
Russe.” Rupert Hazel!, with his partner,
Elsie Day, is another returnee who has not
troubled to vary his act; entertaining enough
for one hearing, it won’t stand repetition.

Hoyt’s Sydney theatre is giving its patrons
this week a sort of tour through the most
hectic districts of New York; and it throws
in some freak pictures of strangled build-
ings and frenzied traffic. The views in
“Night Life of New York” are padded out
with the story of a young man whose father,
to sicken him of the giddy whirl, sends him
to the big American antheap, after making
arrangements with others to get him into as
much trouble as possible. Another film,
“The Ancient Mariner,” has some good pic-
tures following the story of the poem; hut
the attempt to build upon it is not alto-
gether successful. The Lyceum has gone
into its usual annual recess when the
Methodists take control for their annual
conference; the two pictures it presented on
Saturday and Monday last, “Pampered
Youth” and “The Price She Paid,” have the
usual illogical happy endings dragged in by
melodramatic methods, but some good points.
The first film transferred to the Empress
and the second to the Lyric. The Prince
Edward is making a gala night of the open-
ing screening of “The Iron Horse” to-
morrow (Friday) night.

In a country fond of being made miser-
ably happy, it is a strange thing that the
lachrymatory has not been resurrected. The
slender glass vessels in which the ancients
collected their salt drops for deposition in
the tombs of friends and relatives would
then be in the vanity-bags and hip-pockets of
all playgoers. The family mantelpiece would
bo the shrine on which to keep some of these
touching reminders of the weep we all en-
joyed at “Sad Susan” and the glad floods
released by little Eva’s ascent to Heaven;
a covered van would be required to convey
the Monday-morning mail of the popular
Marcuses on whose account flappers now
pour their libations unregarded in the gal-
lery ; and the ushers would collect statistics
of the liquid pints Pauline Frederick had
caused to flow to enable the management to
confound the critics of “The Lady.” These
profound reflections were brought to birth
by Renee Kelly’s revival of “Daddy Long-
legs” at Melbourne King’s on Saturday

evening. That piece is one which millions
have hallowed with their unrecorded tears.
The artfully artless story of the remarkable
girl whom a trustee, concealing his identity,
rescues from an orphan asylum and sends to
an exclusive college, visiting her later in his
own person, and finally revealing himself
simultaneously as her benefactor and her
lover, makes an assault upon the punctum
lachrymale that only a blind, deaf and dumb
assembly could resist. Whoever dramatised
the novel did his job exceeding well. He
made no effort to keep his intentions un-
transparent, but let the great heart of his
hearers into the secret early. Thus from
8.15 to 10.30 all are able to sorrow com-
fortably over the profound tragedy of Judy’s
position, knowing full well that all will be
adjusted in time for the cast to scrape off its
greasepaint and sit down with light hearts
to supper by 11.
* * * *
Renee Kelly, as Judy, showed no signs of
having rubbed the pristine bloom off that
fragile creation in the process of playing
the role more’n a million times. The neces-
sity of being a sweet 16 and anon a vivacious
20 put no strains upon her. With the assist-
ance of Hylton Alien, who by sober acting
rescued Daddy Longlegs from the bath of
molasses in which a generation of emotional
male beauties have immersed him, she made
of the second act a very choice and sustained
bit of funning. The house also rocked each
time Antony Holies (James Mcßride),
whom art or Nature has equipped with a
foolish manner and appearance, agitated his
Oxford bags or made passes with his mit-
tens. George Blunt was George Blunt, as
well as being Cyrus Wykoff, a comic member
of the board of trustees ; and Nellie Mortyne
was a suitably tyrannous and sycophantic,
though sometimes barely audible, matron of
the John Grier home. Dorothy Fane and
Phyllis Best were a trifle too palpably girl-
like as college freshmen ; but Beatrice Day,
as an aristocratic dowager, contrived to be
as much of a marplot as the simple designs
of the playwright would let her. Amongst
the orphans Jim Setches, as an incorrigible
small boy who refuses to be suppressed
merely because his father and mother are
unknown to the police, offered an example
in enunciation to the adult cast, who, especi-
ally in the first act. seemed to harbor the
belief that the auditorium stopped abruptly
at the first row of the stalls. The piece was
notable for thoughtful staging,

Although the pictures are well up to
standard, the major attraction at Melbourne
Majestic this week is not the silent drama
but the harmonious noises made by Elsa
Stralia. The audience which collected on
Saturday appeared to be equally divided
between movie “fans” who were inclined to
regard a live performer as an interloper and
music-lovers who were prepared patiently to
submit to six reels of Harold Bell Wright in
order to have the privilege of hearing an
Australian songstress whose fame abroad is
so considerable. The musical interlude only
comprised the singing of three excerpts from
light opera and a weightier item from “II
Trovatore,” charmingly rendered by the
artist, whose enunciation, however, would
stand improvement. After one encore a fierce
battle was waged by the Harold Bell
Wright faction against the Elsa Stralia
supporters, which the former won. The
mingling of pictures with really high-class
artists is rare in Australia, although it is
a commonplace abroad. The enterprise of
Union Theatres should be successful if its
clientele is not placed on the new mixed diet
too abruptly,

“Kangaroo Flat,” the Australian comedy
by Tal Ordell, draws to a close at the
Athenaeum after a successful Melbourne trot
that commenced before Christmas. In his
spare time, if he has any, Ordell might be
worse employed than in strengthening the
dramatic side of his offspring to make it
worthy of the comedy. It is rumored that
the piece is to be presented in London after
its Sydney showing.

Melbourne Tivoli patrons are acknowledg-
ing that true art is cosmopolitan by taking
to their bosoms with equal fervor English
comedienne Lily Morris, American cowboy
humorist Bob Albright, and a whole crowd
of lesser practitioners who look like a cross-

exhausted. Ralph Holbein, continental
comedian, who draws while he jaws, is by
far the best of them.

At Melbourne Bijou, Gayle Wyer is still

At Hoyt’s Bourke-street (Melb.) em-
porium this week, A. E. W. Mason is emerging
from his book covers in “The Winding
Btair,” in which Edmund Lowe, as a rather
incredible young Englishman, enlists in the
French Foreign Legion and resuscitates the
family honor by performing picturesque
heroisms amidst the savage scenery of
Northern Africa. Florence Vidor says
“Marry Me?” in a seductive manner to a
variety of male persons in the supporting film.

A show of little pictures:—
Miniature-painters, lineal descendants of the monks
who engrafted the Bible on the bottoms of beer-
mugs, once were legion. The camera put them out
of business. Nowadays the art is chiefly patronised
by the unbridled rich, and New York naturally
becomes the Mecca of the cult. Stella Lewis Marks,
a talented Australian, has been producing tabloid
likenesses of the great ones of that metropolis for
many years. Her portraits, especially the children,
are charming, although some betray a desire to
idealise at all costs. Dancer Maud Allan, pianist
Jan Cherniavsky and Mrs. T. Akaboshi, of Tokio,
are painted with the surest hand and the frankest
eye. Cherniavsky would enlarge into a full-sized
picture without loss of spirit, a test the average
miniature would fail to survive. The show is at
the New Gallery, Melbourne.

Point
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Melba has already
begun the extension of her farewell tour and
the spring appearances have been carried on
to the autumn, the whole series being under
the direction of Ibbs and Tillett, owing to
a burst-up with Lionel Powell and Holt, who
had even done the preliminary advertise-
ments for the entire season. Like many other
patriots, Melba has decided to spend a good
deal of the years of her luxurious ease in
“foreign parts,” and not wholly in her be-
loved Australia or her adored England.
Paris is the city chosen for what she herself
describes as a jolly good time, and so the
British income-tax collector will lose an-
other handsome toll. In France the foreign
population has risen to three millions —about
10 times that of Britain.
“Hamfat” : Billy Russell, the leading lady’s
husband and manager, burst into Sydney
ahead of the Nellie Bramley co., which was
finishing a good season at Adelaide; and the
upshot is that Russell holds a lease of
Sydney Opera House for ten years. Nellie
Bramley takes possession on Easter Satur-
day ; in the meantime she is going to have
a holiday. Russell, who did well every-
where else, looks with a fiery eye on Mel-
bourne. He broke a highly successful sea-
son in Sydney to go there; and any town
that helps a new-fledged metropolitan man-
ager to lose money he has made elsewhere
is liable to be disliked.
“Goldilocks”: Eve Grey, who didn’t appeal
to our Great Managers—at least she never
got much of a chance in Australia —has been
constantly in a “shop.” with a good place
in the cast, ever since she reached London.
When the Christmas shuffle came she was
immediately in a fresh part—in “9.45,” an
American detective play shown at tin l
Comedy. She is mentioned as “doing very
well in the love-passages.”
“T.P.”: The revival of nigger-minstrelsy
has started a discussion as to who was the
best burnt-cork artist Australia has known.
My vote goes to Horace Bent, and 1 think
Will Whitburn will agree. I remember
George Lupton, tjic elocutionist, who was the
chorus in “Antieone” when Genevieve Ward
produced it at Melbourne, telling a class that
Horace Bent “put more study into one of
his farces than Mr. Roscius (naming the
most noted Shakspearean actor of the day)
put into his Hamlet.” Australia never
had a better larrikin-impersonator than
Whitburn, but as a corner-man Bent was in
a class of his own.
“Hamfat” : Will Whitburn, in the Tivoli’s
minstrel show, has revived some memories of
Horace Bent; but he didn’t tell this one.
In the days when Horace imagined that he
suffered from every complaint mentioned in
the medical book which frequently went to
sleep with him. a doctor was called in to
save his life. The quack merely took away
the bottle of Scotch and said: “Turn over
and go to sleep, and, when you wake up,
think you’re well.” After much waiting,
and waste of postage, he stopped Bent in the
street one day to demand his guinea. “Go
home and go to sleep, and when you wake up
imagine you’ve been paid,” said Bent
promptly.
“Curtain-raiser” : The Russian invasion is
to arrive in Port Phillip on March 10, and
will have only three days to rehearse its
steps before the opening performance. There
will be 42 people, 380 pieces of luggage and
tons of scenery, and Pavlova is even bring-
ing her own lighting effects. A tugboat is to
meet the vessel and convey the whole land-
ing party ashore to a waiting phalanx ot
motor-cars and -lorries. Lucien Wurmser,
Pav.’s musical director, will be whisked to
Her Majesty’s, and will find J.C.W.’s corps
of harmonists awaiting him. Pavlova’s en-
tourage comprises two secretaries, several
maids-of-all-work and her own chef, and she
will go straight into a private house which
will be rented for her. It seems a mort of
preparation to surround the dainty lady, who
is now a fairly elderly dancing sprite, though
when I saw 7 her in London in 1920 she dis-
played all the grace and lightness of 22.
“Curtain-raiser”: Australia is shortly to
see “The Sport of Kings,” lan Hay’s contri-
bution to the drama of the turf. It has
dramatic quality, and Londoners said they
liked it. The show opens on March 6 at
Melbourne Athenaeum, and leading lady
Zillali Bateman has already unpacked her.
bandboxes. She was one of the innumer-
able band who were studying music in Ger-
many when war broke out. After singing
in opera in Italy for a wdiile, she took to
revue in London.
“C.Q.”: Melbourne Repertorians promise
to spread a sufficiently highbrow repast for
the coming season. St. John Ervine’s
“Anthony and Anna,” Galsworthy’s “Old
English,” Richard Hughes’s “Comedy of
Good and Evil” and “He Who Gets Slapped,”
by the Russian Andreyev, are some of the
dishes that are to be served up, provided the
rights can be obtained.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : The find of December
was a new tenor, Ileddle Nash, who scored
a sensational success as the Duke in the
Old Vic. production of “Rigoletto.” The
voice is of pure lyric quality, and is greatly
enhanced by a suave legato, grace of diction
and exceptional breath-control. Very youth-
ful in appearance, and bearing himself with
ease, the young singer roused the Surrey-
side audience to a greafpitch of enthusiasm,
and already is spoken of as a sure winner
of the highest international fame. Lately
he had a term of study in Italy under Bor-
ghatti and he has come home with all the
poise which the Italian school usually gives.
“E.G.”: “Reno” (B. 18/2/’26) is entirely
wrong when he states that Sally Booth and
Ada Lee were members of the Charles Arnold
co. when they died of bubonic plague at
Sydney in 1902. As a matter of fact, Charles
Arnold left these shores weeks previously.
The unfortunate, artists were under engage-
ment to Willoughby and Geach, and were
putting the finishing touches on the farce
comedy “Wrong Mr. Right.” The company,
owing to the plague, migrated to Melbourne,
there to encounter the Vic. railway strike,
which was eventually crushed by “Iceberg”
Irvine.
A STUDY IN EXPRESSIONS.
MR. EDGEBAY: “Did you notice how pleased
Mrs. Doublecliff was when I told her she
and. her daughter looked like sisters?”
MRS. E.: “No; it was Miss Doublecliff I
teas looking at.”
“Nero”: Jimmy Hughes, who left this
country some seven years ago a dramatic
actor, and now returns to plav the baritone
lead in the musical comedy “Rose Marie,”
says all Australian actors in America are
doing well, notably Harry Plimmer, Reynolds
Denniston, Leonard Willey, Conway Wing-
field, Rupert Julian, Boyd Irwin and Harry
Sweeney. Sweeney, of course, has changed
his name. Soon after his arrival in America
he was interviewing a manager with the idea
of obtaining an engagement and was giving
an account of his many successes in his
homeland. “Say, just what did you say was
your name?” asked the manager. “Sweeney,
Harry Sweeney.” “Ah, Waal, I guess you’d
better change that. You see, over here when
anybody spins a yarn that don’t sound
exactly true we say ‘Oh, tell that to
Sweeney.’ ” So Harry Sweeney became
Henry Mowbray.
“Y.Y.”: The night I went to “The Peli-
can,” at Sydney Palace, the programme
(price 3d.) stated that John Fernside was
to double the parts of Cheriton and the
valet, and Kay Souper was to do Lauzun.
The first feat I knew —having seen the play
in London —to be impossible. When Cheri-
ton appeared he turned out to be old friend
Kenneth Brampton. Lauzun was taken by
an actor unknown to ine, but certainly not
Kay Souper. In other parts of the world,
if changes are made in the programmed cast,
the audience is informed of them per in-
serted slip. The appearance of understudies
is also announced in this way. Such con-
sideration is felt to.be due to both audience
and actors. There, but not here. .
“Abracadabra”: “Tabragalba’s” champion-
ship of his picture-showman (B. 28/l/’26)
reveals astonishing gullibility and ignorance
of the film situation. With
the existing opposition among
exchanges-—there are eight
well-known companies and
several smaller organisations
—any showman who arranges
to take all his supplies from
one concern is either incapable
of controlling his own business
or has found by experience
that the company gives him a
fair spin. I don’t know of one
showman who has been forced
to screen any picture on a per-
centage basis. Many prefer
this arrangement, but, in any
case, refusal is a showman’s
prerogrative, which he fre-
quently exercises to the extent
of boycotting a particular pic-
ture or a film house whose
policy does not please him.
Every “cahmp’ny” operating
in Australia lias a good Aus-
tralian at the helm, and but for these
“cahmp’nies” several hundred Australians
would be looking for jobs.
“Wood’s Green” (Lond.) : At Madame
Lily Payling’s concert in the Albert Hall,
London, the new singer of the occasion was
Elsie Hurst, a soprano who two years ago
was a skirt-hand at the Bon Marche, Brix-
ton. At some of the employees’ social gather-
ings the young seamstress poured forth her
soul in song. A friend who heard her
brought the girl under the notice of Madame
Payling, who has trained her and given her
much encouragement. Miss Hurst, who has
been filling small engagements during the
past 18 months at cinemas and suburban
concerts, got a valued opportunity from her
Australian friend on this Albert Hall pro-
gramme.
“Sturt” : The Repertory Theatre of Adel-
aide pointed with pride at its annual meeting
to a long record of good plays produced. (It
was the first body of its kind in Australia,
having at first the probably better name of
the Literary Theatre.) It has had only four
chairmen, Bryceson Treliearne (its founder),
Ronald F'inlayson, Talbot Smith and Prof.
Archibald Strong. The last named was away
in Europe most of last year, and Wilfred
Neill deputised for him. Thomas Nave has
had to give lip “producing” ; but Frank John-
ston and Olive Carey, of the Oonservatorium.
come in to assist Ray Walsh and Mr. and
Mrs. Neill.
“Mayne Stay” : I don’t agree with “Caesar’s
Ghost” (B. 28/l/'26) that costume drama
is more popular with his sex than the other,
but I saw a lot more blokes than janes on
my two visits to “The Farmer’s Wife” at
Sydney Palace. There were men alone, and
men in groups of three and four, with never
a skirt among them—most unusual in my
experience of the theatre. I found the play
refreshing, apd the suggestion of the West
Country in the speech of most of the charac-
ters —the real dialect would have been unin-
telligible to an Australian audience —was
cleverly managed. But there was no Ameri-
can slang, humor or ragtime in the thing, so
Gertie and Bella went elsewhere.
“Cosmo”: The man in advance of a co.
which visited Goulburn (N.S.W.) for one
night only made the subjoined appeal to the
public's throbbing heart: —
Grand Production of Mrs. Henrv Wood’s Great Work
“EAST LYNNE.”
Mothers, bring your Children to see Little Willie
taken to Heaven by the Angels!
And didn’t they bring ’em ! Still the effort
wasn’t as good as one of 20 years ago. That
time mothers were urged >to come and see
Willie ascend with colored lights.
“Canar”: Talking of indistinguishable
twins (B. 11/2/’26), two chorus girls of a
pantomime company which played in Sydney
a dozen years ago might have baffled their
own mother. During rehearsals the producer
made one wear a colored ribbon on her arm,
for identification purposes. So extraordinary
was the resemblance between the two that
for a time they shared one boy between
them ; the youth had been taking them both
to supper and for joy rides in Centennial
Park for some weeks before he discovered
that he had two girls instead of one. Just
before the war they went to the United
States, where they made a hit with a quick
change act, the secret of the remarkable
rapidity with which they appeared in dif-
ferent costumes never being guessed. During
the influenza epidemic some years later
one of them died in London and that fin-
ished the act; the other married shortly
afterwards.
“Centurion”: Nigel Playfair, who made
such a success of the revivals of “The Beg-
gar’s Opera” and “Polly,” has struck good
gold in another long-abandoned eighteenth-
century claim, “Lionel and Clarissa.” Like
its predecessors, it is a comedy-opera; Isaac
Bickerstaff wrote it, and the songs were set
to music by Charles Dibdin, of “Black-eyed
Susan” and “Tom Bowling” celebrity. Play-
fair himself plays the Old Philanderer, an
ancient rip with regrettable designs on other
people’s daughters but Puritan views on the
upbringing of his own. The plot turns on
the success of his youthful pal, the hero, in
inducing the old boy to arrange details of an
“MEASURE FOR MEASURE.”
“I don’t think there was much in his sermon,
do you?”
“No. But there was far less in the plate.”
elopement, in which, though he doesn’t know
it, his own daughter plays the leading role.
Evergreen Haydn Coffin, Lottie Venne and
Herbert Waring are others in the cast, and
the show is pulling ’em in at Hammersmith
in battalions.
“Mako”: The revival of “Are You a
Mason?” emphasises the scarcity of really
good farces. After a quarter of a century
“Charley’s Aunt,” “Are You a Mason?” and
“The Private Secretary” are still sure of an
audience, and nothing more modern seems
likely to jolt them from their pedestals.
There is a great opportunity for some Aus-
tralian humorist to provide a fourth.
“Stella Dallas” is a “mighty epic of Ameri-
can life” by Mrs. Olive Higgins Prouty.
Two million people read the story in an
American magazine, and a million more
dog’s-eared the novel. In fact, it has had
almost as much reverence poured out upon
it as the Bible and the list of Melbourne
Cup winners. Consequently when the Gold-
wyn picture was privately screened in Mel-
bourne, Sunday evening was selected as the
most appropriate time, and the Capitol
(which has the appearance of a heathen
fane where fowls are disembowelled to fore-
cast the weather) as the place. The famous
Wurlitzer, under the sympathetic control of
organist Weber, provided the ecclesiastical
accompaniment to an 11-reel masterpiece, in
which no character falls below the level of
moral greatness typified by Abraham Lincoln
and Barbara Fritchie. Stella Dallas is a
low-born creature with an urge to rise above
herself. In a moment of deaf passion a
young aristo. of Fifth-avenue and the Cen-
tury Club marries her, only to discover when
his ears are opened that she metaphorically
drops her aitehes. He remains true to her,
however, until he comes to the convenient
but wrong conclusion that she has been un-
faithful. In order that her daughter will
turn from her in loathing and join her father
amidst the pomps, vanities and advantages
of the fashionable world, Stella allows them
to think the worst of her; and the pathetic
story closes with the self-sacrificing mother
watching through a window her daughter
being wedded to a limb of the N York
nobility. The picture, which is admirably
photographed, will make a wide appeal.
WASTED SYMPATHY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘The worst horrors are perpetrated with music,’
says Dame Nellie in an article in an English paper.
‘Recently I heard a piece begin with a flute playing
G natural and an oboe C sharp. I ground my teeth
in sheer indignation that the great masters,
lying in their graves, should be so insulted.’ ”
Did every great composer
Feel gratitude beneath
The sod, to think that Melba
For him had ground her teeth y
Do Mozart and Beethoven,
Desire mad noises curbed.
They who composed so often,
Are they themselves disturbed?
With mental eve I burrowed,
In every grave 1 nosed,
And found that each old master
Was really decomposed.
Yet was no tonal discord
That they esteemed a crime
To blame; the fault that mattered
With them was one of time.
N.S.W.

THE
ALL-BRITISH
PLANT.
By the Engine’s Reputation
you may Judge
'hrer-lm
T»flg HsunxG
YOU know the Lister Engine—everyone does —the one
engine about which you never hear anything but praise.
Reliable, simple, economical in upkeep, everlasting—all these
terms in the superlative degree have long ago been exhausted
by Lister Engine users. We do not know of a Lister Engine
being scrapped or replaced.
Round the Lister Engine is built the Lister-Lite plants. Obviously we cannot
afford to lower, in any part of the plant, the Rolls-Royce standard set by the
engine. Generator, Battery and Switchboard are, therefore, selected with infinite
care, and our installations are carried out only by experts.
The Generator is, like the engine, a Lister; the Battery is an English-built
Tudor, of a special heavy-duty type. The Switchboard control is as simple
as we can make it while retaining maximum reliability. The plant is
economical to use, as it requires the engine to be run only once a week. Practi-
cally speaking, therefore, with a Lister-Lite the first cost is the last. And the
initial outlay is not very great, considering the benefits you get in return. Let us
quote you for a plant suitable for the number of lights you wish to use.

WAYNE PUMP 49*'F
Its Beauty and Utility will
Attract Business ■
In proportion, balance, and grace of line the Wayne
492-F is undoubtedly the finest-looking visible petrol
pump the world has ever seen. The very appearance of
this splendid pump attracts business.
But the striking appearance of this handsome Wayne
pump is but one of its many superior features.
Accurate to a hair, the customer sees in its big, visible
five-gallon container, every ounce of petrol that he pur-
chases. There are two sets of quantity markers on two
sides of the bowl, all accurately set and tested before the
pump leaves the factory.
Quick and positive in operation, the easy, smooth, uniform
action of its twin cylinder piston pump enables the operator
of a Wayne model 492-F to deliver petrol from the storage
tank to the motor vehicle very rapidly. It only takes
20 seconds to lift and discharge five gallons of petrol.
Passed and approved by the Department
of Weights and Measures of
Hew South Wales and all other States.

Wayne equipment for the storage, measuring
and pumping of Oil and Petrol) write to :

when overworked.
The modern round of life
makes overstrain difficult
to avoid. Overstrain comes
to men via business worries,
overwork, hurried meals,
etc.; to women through
domestic worry, excitement,
late hours, etc.
The effects of overstrain are
first apparent in exhausted nerves
and impaired digestion. Benger’s
is the one Food which rests the
digestive system and fully nourishes
the body.

CHASSIS OF GOULDING SPECIAL
THE NEW MEDIUM WEIGHT SIDECAR
Sidecarring is No Longer an Uncomfortable Sport
With a Chassis like this
BU ILT on sound engineering prin-
ciples and embodying the well-
known, tried and proved Goulding
floating axle, the chassis of the Goulding
Special represents the last word in com-
fortable sidecarring. The full elliptic
body springs of the big Goulding are re-
placed by a long flexible transverse semi-elliptic
spring which gives lower body position, lighter
weight and a beautifully easy ride.
In most cases a Qoulding costs less than an ordinary Sidecar

F.S.H.: You haven’t told it well enough.
But there’s a yarn there. Try again... .M.J.McC.:
Much obliged; but of course it’s too late now. And,
anyway, it was answered much more effectively....
Tasdigger: May be true; but is it likely to help
you at the moment?... .Vicnix: Thank you; afraid
the idea is too complicated. The cartoon that has
to be studied to get its meaning is no chop....
Friar J.: Well done; but rather off our beat....
C.V.H.: Not quite... .1.K.W.: Don’t think so. Your
ear seems hopeless.... Surveyor: Off our beat....
H.C.L.: Yes, we’ve been urging that system or one
like it for Second Chamber elections. For the other
it doesn’t seem workable... .B.Z. (Auckland): As
thin and slight as every flapper seems to want to
be.... John O.: It misses by some distance... .C.D.
(Ivirribilli): It’s a long time working to a very
small point. .. .A.S.L.: Not for us... .Padraie:
It isn’t convincing.... Maud S.: Wants more skill
to make it credible; then it might be a good yarn.
....H.8.L.: There isn’t enough in either of than.
....Claudia: There’s not much wrong with it except
that there’s too little right with it. A yarn must
have more in it than that 1.C.M.: The not very-
musical substance of a thin drawing-room ditty... .
Roger E.: The verse is poor, but you seem to have
a remarkable knowledge of the tastes of the Deity.
Bunthorne: Not enough skill Richard C.:
Falls far short.... Grace R.: The verse is too frail.
E.W. (Longreach) : Some very nigged lines with
bad and awkward rhymes K.W.C.: Can’t guess
what the wild thing means L.W. (Otahuhu) : Not
in our line... .M. 5.8.: The tragedy is too cheap and
unlikely... .H.J.8.; We don’t find it very thrilling.
. ...L.H.P.: Not nearly enough plums in your
pudding C.M. (Byron Bay): “Spotty” fails in
the telling. Take your coat "off to it W.H.8.:
Too wild and murderous Firefly: The absent-
minded tales are of an old pattern... .J.E.M.: Very
ciude... .Moonbria: Weak flutter on heavy wings....
W.H.D.: Doesn’t make its point sharp enough....
G.0.A.: They touch about the limit of futility....
G.T. (Elsternwick): Not very robust imitations of
a sort of thing that has been done too often....
0.J.C.: They fail for two main reasons. One is that
you have nothing to say, the other that you try to
make up the deficiency with affected writing. ...
T.A.H.: One cheerful but bewildering fragment:—-
But though the years do go by and days into weeks
do turn
My heart does ever well beat true, my heart for
Mollie yearn.
I, yearning, weep and grieve and speak and dream
unto home sweet home.
And when I do go back from home I’ll no more
roam.
For the Mother that I will love true is Bonny Jean
to me,
And Molly dear is my sweetheart, They're home
sweet home to me.
. ...M.H.S.: The things said are too
L.J.M.: A good idea, but it wants to be made to
hang together a bit better. The last sheet seems
to be without meaning.... R.W.T.; The verse as it
stands is not in good enough shape.... E.M. (or some
other initials) : Can’t raise a snigger from “Smiles.”
. ...F.A.W.: The Ode is not up to the mark....
J. : Get something real to write about and then
see that you handle the subject freshly. Your lines
scan and rhyme, but they are all tagged out with
old phrases.... Elbe S.: The yarn is not very con-
vincingly told. The intimate parts of it could hardly
be published. . - .H.A.G.: The matter is far too slight;
and that constant change of tense is irritating....
D.McK.: Very bad.... Eleanor M.: You can’t rhyme
“fringed” with “ringed” C.W.P.: You haven’t
taken enough care to say what you mean.. . . J.R.L.:
The conclusion has a gentle virulence: —-
The pubs are closed at six o'clock,
At eight tobacco’s under lock,
No matches then are bought or sold—-
Enough to make one’s blood run cold.
They’ll resurrect the curfew next
On pettifogging poor pretext,
All glims be doused at eight o’clock,
To all young bloods a fearful knock.
So let us say: “To Hell with wowsers
And one-eyed women who wear trousers,
And duck them in the nearest trough
To stop their antics and their froth.”
. . ..E.8.G.: Shocking... .C.G.H.: The “fine young
fellow” and all the rest will have to sing a lot better
before they get a hearing in this paper... .S.J.J.:
The verse falls far short... .The Foolosopher: Doesn’t
get to anything Alfred S.: The verse canters awk-
wardly with one hind-leg in a sling.... Gem G.c The
lines are very rugged and contain, no real description
of anything... .Jim M.: The “clouds” are too com-
monplace and the verse is too p00r... .E.D. (Perth) :
“Heredity” is not up H.8.R. : You have wild
notions of rhythm and rhyme T.H.8.: Very
crude.... T.H.E.: The verse about the motor-car is
too, too sad... .D.0.D.; Wild and untamed stuff,
deficient in interest. N.E.R.; Doesn’t say what it
wants to 8.A.C.: The sonnet is pretty bad....
O.F. (Newcastle); The thanksgiving is woodener
than the woodenest ham Uncle Sam ever made....
Medicus: No use saying it in that tormented way....
B.C, (Carnegie) : It is not strong enough to fly.. . .
J. J.D.; Drop those affectations—especially the habit
of writing three meaningless words, following them
with three dots and then trying to say something
wild... .C.G.A.; Too much melodrama... .Rhode W.:
The verse has some quality, but the theme is too
slight to carry all those words... .R.W.T.: Has
too many bad spots W.D.F.: All must go back.
P.O.P.: They are a long way off... .P.H.C.:
A welcome variation of an old idea; now see if
you can’t improve the verse.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.A.H.: Not anxious to inspect further samples.
... .A.F.A.W.: Labored little studies... .E.C.: Futur-
istic-looking automobile consigned to the junk heap.
R.K.: You are an incorrigible offender. .. .H.T.:
The male bather’s lower limbs want remodelling....
5.8.; “The Family Bar of Soap” slipped into oblivion.
. ...M.K.: Your penitent wombat can’t burrow into
our pages... . J.R.U.: Evidently the gentleman’s
crumpled attitude is due to a fall from an aeroplane.
.... J.M.F: As mystifying as an Einstein problem
S.S.: The knack of foreshortening is foreign to you.
... .J.E.S.: During the past year that joke has
been used by 41 comic papers, four circus clowns,
two panto, comedians and an unknown number of
vaudeville artists.
“Eureka”: The names on a row of week-
end cottages at Yarra Bay (N.S.W.) would
make a prohibitionist groan iu bitterness
of spirit. They run: “Oomeanavadrirsk,”
“Avanotherone,” “Dryazell,” “Drunkazell”

Gives leadership to the Unit-Built
Studebaker
Studebaker Big Six, powerful and rugged, is
the fastest selling high-powered car in the
world. It is noted particularly for its engine,
the crankshaft of which is machined on
all surfaces, insuring smooth, vibrationless
operation.
Its high quality and low price
are possible because Studebaker
makes all its own engines,
bodies, steering gears, clutches,
gear boxes, differentials, springs,
axles, grey iron castings and
drop forgings in its own great
factories. Extra profits, which
others pay to outside parts and
body makers, are thus eliminated
and these savings are returned to the product
in better materials and finer workmanship.
For instance, Studebaker pays a premium for
steels of extra toughness; it uses only the
strongest and best woods in its body frames.
There are only seven
American made cars hav-
ing as much or more pow-
er than Studebaker Big
Six , according to the
Royal Automobile Club
and the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers , but
they sell for two to four
times its price.
Upholstering is the best quality in every
instance.
The hundreds of parts used in a Studebaker
are designed, engineered and manufactured
under one supervision and therefore function
as a perfectly co-ordinated unit.
This results in longer life, greater
riding comfort and a higher re-
sale value.
As a natural outgrowth of One-
Profit, Unit-Built construction,
a third great advantage to the
buyer is attained —“No-Yearly-
Models.” Because all phases of
manufacture are directly under
Studebaker control, Studebaker
cars are constantly kept up-to-date. Improve-
ments are continually added, not saved up for
spectacular annual announcements which
make cars artificially obsolete. Resale values
are thus stabilized.

“My heart with pleasure thrills
And dances with the daffodils* ’
When penning these lines Wordsworth must have felt in a rather
exultant mood. A heart that wants to go jazzing with the daffo-
dils is unusually rare, and what a merry old world this would
be if we could all have those feelings. But, modern conditions
of living intervene. The constant race againSt time means
hurried and irregular meals, which in time claim their pitiless
toll in the form of Acute Indigestion
And it's when the digestive organs become clogged with poisonous
secretions that those dull, nagging pains in the stomach arise.
Headaches, constipation and despondency follow —life doesn’t
seem to be worth living
In this state you require a true service medicine, such as that reliable old family jriend

FOR OUR ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE No. 20.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Ararnac”: Recently two railway trucks
loaded with five oak logs running to 19,000
odd super feet were delivered at a Tolga
(N.Q.) mill. The five logs were all cut
from the one tree, and the average girths
ran to 20ft. and lengths to 13ft. The value
of the tree in logs at the mill went close
to £250. This must be nearly a record?
“Bris” : Something in the line of a “Get-
Together” Club has been started by the
Queensland Preference League, which draws
its membership in about equal proportions
from the Chamber of Manufactures and the
Trades Hall. Leading manufacturers, com-
mercial men and trade-union officials meet
at a weekly luncheon at a city cafe to dis-
cuss ways and means of boosting Queens-
land industries. The league has adopted
the pineapple as its emblem; as the fruit
would be rather awkward to wear as a
boutonniere, a gilt medallion takes its place.
* * * *•
“Bill Ding”: The most imposing of the
many Masonic “temples” which have sprung
up in Australia of late is on North-terrace,
Adelaide, opposite the Exhibition Building;
but to the disgrace of the craft the only
Australian wood used in it is for the floors.
Even if the Pacific maple comes in in the
log, that doesn’t condone the preference.
The Victorian craftsmen have long pinned
their faith to blackwood for room-panelling,
Queensland resorts to its maple, Westralia
swears by jarrah, and New South sees that
its local woods are not neglected. South
Aus. had a great choice a"d failed utterly.
* * * *
“Senojo”: Some of Melbourne’s artistic
souls are protesting against Commissioner
Clapp’s hideous hoardings and suggesting the
cancellation of his poet’s license. Rhymes
about raisin duff and Mount Buff. are stig-
matised as offensive to eye and ear alike.
The offender has replied with a few more
slogans about peaches and beaches; he has
further intimated that lie doesn’t care a
fruit stone for the artists and the {esthetes,
but is determined to appeal to John Citizen in
poetry and prose suitable to that person’s
station and understandings. So it looks as
if the artists will have to rush past railway
buildings with a palette screening their
agonised eyes.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: Anyone who has bought
ostrich feathers from a Cape Town dealer
will be astonished to hear that the feather
trade is now at such a low ebb that the birds
are being killed for mere fat and skin.
Over-production and changes of fashion have
made feathers a drag on the market, and the
ostrich is as expensive to keep as a stud
sheep. Someone has discovered that the
skin makes a handsome “fancy” leather,
and Cape flocks are now being heavily
culled for killing. It is reckoned that
20,000 birds were slain last year for skins
alone, and “plumes” once worth £OO a pound
are now merely a side-line.
» * * *
“Jacky Roo”: N. S. Wales sheepowners
are wearing dismal faces at present. This
time last year prime wethers were fetching
30s. and over at Homebusli, and the store
market was excellent. This year a man is
counted fortunate if his wethers top the £.
As for the store market, it is doubtful, tak-
ing the conditions into consideration, whether
it has ever looked so depressing. For medi-
ocre sheep there is no demand whatever; for
good merinos the prices would bring tears to
the eyes of a dealer. The cause of the slump
is difficult to discover. Some blame Lang;
others the menace of sniafil; others the bush-
fires, which have destroyed hundreds of
thousands of acres of winter grass.
* * * *
“Burglar’s Laborer”: An assault case has
thrown light on a surprisingly remunerative
occupation. Nowadays nearly every town
block has its night watchman, besides the
official who is a regular employee of big busi-
ness houses and buildings, and the system
has extended into the suburbs. The block
watchman, often a retired but still hefty
police officer, operates on private-enterprise
lines, collecting a small weekly payment from
each of the people whose premises he keeps
an eye on, and his right in his beat is be-
coming a sort of vested interest. One man
recently claimed that his territory was worth
£6OO a year to him. The assault case pro-
ceeded from a difference of opinion between
two North Sydney watchmen as to where
one’s “witch” ended and the other’s began.
* * * #
“FY7”: The Tariff Board was as Red the
other day to sample an unusual brand of
liquor, and to do it in an unusual way. The
stuff was distilled from pineapples, and the
distiller, who wanted the excise duty on
it brought into line with that on grape
brandies, asked the board to test its “velvety
quality” by touch. In the long ago the
West Indies made a rum from pineapples
which was highly popular in England—
readers of “Pickwick” will remember it was
the pet vanity of Mr. Stiggins. In the days
before Federation a German distiller in Bris-
bane used to make a very palatable liqueur of
pineapples, as well as vinegar and other by-
products. The distiller can use the small
pines and other rejects of the canners.
* * * *
“Koolamarra”: Bunchy-top, so long a
curse to the banana-growers in northern
N.S.W., has now made an appearance in
Queensland, having been located at Dayboro,
a banana-growing centre between Brisbane
and Caboolture, on the North Coast. The
disease is broadcasted by an aphid, which
is said to be carried from one plantation
to another by the wind. If this is correct
Queensland banana-cockies are in for a bad
time. About two years ago a deputation of
North Coast growers waited on the Banana-
land Minister for Agriculture, and suggested
the advisability of declaring a buffer area
20 miles wide along the Queensland border,
the idea being to prohibit the growing of
bananas in such area. The plan, had it been
put in operation, would have been costly,
but might have saved the rest of the
State. Now the growers are blaming the
Government for laxity, and are suggesting
another buffer area north of Caboolture.

The Saving

Alone,
although only a small part of
the saving effected by the in-
stallation of
Self-Aligning

is sufficient to more than justify the
adoption of SKF Transmission Equip-
ment.
SKF Transmission Equipment also
gives the greater advantages of power
saving, and reduction of maintenance
costs.

“Eau-de”: The 20,G00-ton Cunard liner
Carinthia created a new record the other
day. She stopped at Thursday Island to
pick up a pilot, and successfully navigated
Torres Strait. The largest ship that had
previously passed through was in the 12,000-
ton class.
“The Oldest Inhabitant”: Where did Gov-
ernor Phillip land? A recent writer states
that Macquarie kept the exact spot in mem-
ory by erecting the Obelisk in Macquarie-
place whence the distances to the interior
are measured. Is there anything on record
to fix that so?
“Bris”: Relics of old times in Brisbane
are the hitching-posts in the main thorough-
fares. Queen-street alone has a dozen of
them. Many of the posts are of moulded
iron, surmounted with horses’ heads. One
never sees a horse tied up in Queen-street
nowadays, but the hitching-posts have their
use as props for tired citizens discussing the
gee-gees.
“Black Tracker”: The steamer Nordic
arrived at the Wallaroo (S.A.) anchorage
from Newcastle to load wheat, and having
dropped her anchor waited instructions.
When a berth had been allotted she started
to up anchor. It was noticed that the winch
was laboring heavily; a second anchor,
rusty and thick with barnacles, had been
hooked. It was brought to the surface and
proved to be the one lost by the four-masted
barque Bermuda in 1911, during a heavy
storm.
“Hartog” : In the old church of Bishop's
Stortford, Hertfordshire, there is (or lately
was) the following inscription:—
To the memory of Sir George Jackson, Bart.,
afterwards Sir George Duckett, Bart., Judge Advocate
of the Fleet, who died on 15th December, 1922, aged
97 years. He was for many years secretary to the
Admiralty and member of Parliament for Weymouth
and Melcombe Regis, and Colchester. Captain Cook,
of whom he was a zealous friend and an early
patron, named after him Point Jackson, in Row
Zealand, and Port Jackson in Xew,South \Vaios.
So Sydney had a close shave, it seems, of
living on ‘Port Duckett. The harbor seems
to have been christened just before its god-
father changed his name.
“Coppertop” : I was among the first batch
of Australians to set foot in New York en
route to France. Our arrival coincided with
the floating of one of America’s numerous
Liberty Loans, and in return for giving us
a good time ashore the loan committee util-
ised us to assist in selling bonds. One
Digger auctioned hat for the good cause;
it realised a thousand dollars —that is to
say, he sold a bond for 1000 dollars and
threw in his hat as a bonus. In Broadway
I auctioned my money-belt, which fetched
3000 dollars in the same way. The buyer
was satisfied to return the belt if I gave
him an Australian shilling. He got it, but
I don’t think he realised he had taken half
a day’s pay off me.
“Hamer” : The tendency towards gregari-
ousness in certain trades is developing
rapidly in Sydney. The premises of the
two big mercery and men’s clothing firms,
Palmer’s and Murdoch’s, have met in Park-
street, forcing out the small shops devoted
to other business. Further down, in both
Pitt and George streets, the other big men’s
clothing firms, Lowe’s and Gowing s, are, bit
by bit, absorbing the shops around them.
Motor business concentrates in Castlereagh-
street between Market and Park streets, and,
in fact, has seized upon the whole block
on the cast, round into Elizabeth-street. In
the reconstruction of the Park-George-
Bathurst-Pitt-street block, Bebarfald’s big
furniture warehouse will occupy the Park-
Gcorge-street corner, with Morley Johnson’s
as a neighbor; there are other big furniture
places handy. Jewellers show an in-
creasing tendency to concentrate on the King-
street portion of what used to be known as
“The Block,” although there is another
group in Hunter-street. Time was when it
was considered unwise to open a shop for
the sale of any variety of goods where com-
petition existed; to-day it is recognised as
being to the advantage of both buyer and
seller that certain localities should specialise
in certain goods.
“J.E.” : Two theories have been advanced
to explain the wet habits which the earth
has developed in so many widely separated
regions, including Holland and Mexico.
One is that the clouds are being torn up and
knocked about by aircraft, which would
naturally upset their internal arrangements.
So far as I know the bird which is made
of meat and feathers avoids the clouds, but
the internal combustion fowl goes through
them. The other proposition is more seri-
ous. It was published some time ago that
the nitrogen which forms 80 per cent, of the
atmosphere would be a profitable and amaz-
ing reservoir of fertiliser if it could only be
condensed and bagged, and that condensation
was quite possible. If some United States
syndicate, helped out by depraved chemists
of German extraction, is bagging our gas-
eous envelope and trading it off as guano,
there may not be sufficient envelope left to
hold up the customary cistern of water.
In that case the worst may be expected
unless the syndicate is identified and slain,
These views have no connection with Noah’s
deluge, for in his day there were, it is
assumed, neither chemists nor aircraft,
though angels flew about a good deal. The
upheaval of Noah was caused by some fair-
sized heavenly body passing too close to the
earth in its million-year orbit. It may even
have scraped some of the high places, and
there are lofty spots in the Himalayas which
certainly wear a scraped appearance. The
attraction of this visitant naturally drew
the seas out of their beds, and they raced
three times round the world before they
settled down again. Hence the Scriptural
statement that “all the fountains of the
great deep were broken up”—up, not down.
Of course the shifting of the polar ice caps,
which washed around in the tropics till they
melted, narrowly missing the Ark on various
occasions, added to the flood and the dis-
turbance, and the tearing up of the atmo-
sphere made it rain a good deal, though not
worse than it does in the west of Scotland.
The new ice-cap at the South Pole is esti-
mated to be 10,000 ft. thick. If the vast and
disorganising meteor comes again, which I
expect it will do next year, and this mass
breaks loose, its dissolution will lift the sea
level so that Goat Island (Sydney) will
disappear.

Psyche in Hell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PALE Psyche crying at the mouth of
HeU! . . ,
Pale Psyche weeping on her love-
lorn way!
Dark is the downward path where foul things
dwell; . . „
And steeped in slime the leprous liell-
flowers sway!
“What do you hold within your little hands?
What gifts to bribe the warders of the
dead ?
Accursed and desolate the unnamed lands
That lie along the plain
Your feet must tread!
And he who thither goes comes not again !
Strange, monstrous shapes will flap about
you there,
And skinny harpies snatch your streaming
hair,
The furies scorch you with their ravening
breath,
And the lost shades, unquieted by death.
Rake you with eyeballs pitiless and cold!
What do you hold, Psyche, what do you
hold?”
“A casket in one trembling hand I hold.
Brought from the coast where Aphrodite
played; ,
A loaf of barley-bread to bribe the beast —
All honey-sweet with earth’s fecundity—
And, in my mouth, two coins of glinting gold
No whining shade
Debarred from burial feast
Shall pluck from me.
I shall be deaf to every anguished plea,
Who go thrice-girded down the way of death
To win immortal beauty and the breath
Of love eternal from Persephone!”
“Deep is the nine-coiled Styx, O Psyche, dark
The loathsome caverns shuttered from the
light!
Pallid and stark
The hands importunate that float
And cleave the stream
Blacker than night;
Sullen the ferryman who rows the boat.
What path is there your little feet shall
take
On from the country of the mourning dead ?
Go you toward Tartarus or will you tread
The sweet Elysian fields where flowers wake
And ripened fruits in sunny orchards break?”
“Down the green pathway of the gods I go,
With love a lamp to guide me; for I know
That I shall soon return from dark-caved
death.
Beneath my casket-lid the incense-breath
Of pure Persephone I take above-
immortal Beauty and immortal Love!”
Pale Psycho singing at the mouth of Hell!
Pale Psyche back to the green earth again,
Joyous with her reward! Oh, Psyche, tell,
Was the quest worth the anguish and the
pain?
VICTORIA.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN Bena Rosen called at the
Surplus Stores of Jacob Abelson
(“buyer of job goods of every de-
scription”), she was told Abelson had just
gone out, but the Missus would be in the
living-room above. Bena stumbled up the
stairs.wearily, for she was stricken in corns
if not in years.
“Why, Bena,” said Anna Abelson, “I
thought you’d forgotten your way here; you
ain’t been wearing my doorstep down lately.”
“Veil, Anna, to tell you the truth, since
you got so high up I don’t care so much about
coming.” Bena was not alluding to the
Abelsons’ social position ; she was speaking
literally. Jacob’s need of floor space had
sent the living-room up to the second storey.
“Sit down now you are here,” and Anna
pushed an easy chair forward.
“Don’t make me too comfortable; I am in
a hurry,” protested Bena. “No, no, you
shall not trouble to make tea. Veil, if I
must, the least leetle drop of kummel, and
I’ll tell you what brought me to-day.”
“I can guess,” said Anna.
“You’ve got a mistake,” and Bena lowered
her voice. “Did you know about that sher-
mozzel we had with the fire insurance?”
Anna politely and untruthfully disclaimed
any knowledge. “Did you come out of it
all right?”
“All right you may say, but vot it cost us
may Jacob earn it every day, and I’m not
cursing you none. Ve had that creat gonov,
Sir Arthur Elvy, K.C., so the money being
more as diamonds to us just now, I’ve taken
my earrinks to Ellis, the auctioneer.”
“Not the ones your husband gave you for
your silver wedding?”
“The same. I remembered you envied ’em,
so I came to tell you.”
Anna considered a moment. “Any re-
serve on them?”
“Von hondred pounds.”
“A hundred pounds? Not giving them
away, are you, Bena?”
“Now, now, Anna, ven I told you Gershon
gave a hondred and thirty for them you said
they vos dirt sheap.”
“Maybe I did, but they was not for sale
when I said it.”
Bena could not combat Anna’s logic, so
changed the subject. “I hear Jacob bought
a lot of suitcases sheap.”
“Cheap’s dear if they don’t sell, and those
suitcases look like being a stuck line.”
“Veil, Anna, I’ll be going. I only came
in to tell you about our leetle Hobble. I
thought, being friends, you’d be glad to
know.”
Jacob came home late, and Anna pouredi
out tea and the news together.
“Bena Rosen was here this morning.”
“So?”
“She’s put her diamond earrings into
auction.”
“Supposen,” said Jacob uneasily. “Lot of
people put their diamond earrings in auc-
tion.”
“I fancy those earrings.”
“I fancy those herrings. Are there any
more, Anna?”
“Plenty. They looked so good in their
case.”
“They eat good.”
“I’m meaning the earrings looked good in
their case.”
“Did they? Let them stop there then.
That was a funny story I heard in the City
to-day.”
Anna was not amused. Did Jacob think
to stall her off with a funny story like she
was some simple shicksa bringing back a
leaky umbrella? Her face took on a certain
expression, familiar to her husband and very
often dear.
Jacob temporised. “What does Bena want
for the earrings?”
“A hundred pounds.”
Abelson whistled. “That’s quite a lot of
money, Anna.”
“Jacob Abelson, once on a time, when I
was maybe younger, if you only had ;> five
shillings half of it was mine for asking.
"Easy that was; it only cost two and six.
But a hundred pounds is different again.
“Nothing should be too much for your
wife. If”
“Well, don't make a song of it, said Jacob
irritably.
“I’m finished,” declared Anna.
In the evenings when the children were
in bed Mr. and Mrs. Abelson had time for
a quiet chat. Jacob would bring the day’s
news, and they would discuss their own and
their friends’ affairs as couples will. But
this night Anna had a grievance, and though
she forbore to “make a song of it,” it was
nevertheless a recurring theme, marring the
harmony of their hour together.
“Barney Levine is paying two and tup-
pence in the pound,” began Jacob.
“Is that so? Well, I’m very sorry.”
“What’s your sorrow?”
“Such a good husband. Bought his wife
three motor-ears in two years, and a real
ermine-lined evening-cloak.”
“So, no wonder Barney went broke!”
A pause. Then: “I heard this morning
Sam Kaddes is dead.”
Anna shrugged. “Well, a better man than
him once died.”
“What have you got against him?”
“He kept all his money, never let his wife
have no life at all. And now, I suppose,
she’ll marry again and have a fine old time
on Sam’s gilt. Well, that ought to teach
some people not to stinge!”
Her husband’s skin was thick, but in the
quiet hours of the night Jacob Abelson, the
Surplus King, knew himself for the worm
he was. Remorse, or the pickled herrings
he had eaten rather late, made him wakeful.
Anna’s words came back at him, and wor-
rie<’ 1 him worse than a stuck line. True,
when they were first married, she had but
to ask, and everything he had was hers.
And little she had wanted. Not for Anna
the solo games her friends played; and as
for throwing away good money on horse-
racing—-not thrippence. Many a time Jacob
was tempted to use the stock money and buy
some finei’y to set off her comeliness, but
Anna had said, “Not now, Jacob. Bye and
bye, when we get on a bit.” And wouhl they
have got on without Anna’s shrewdness, in-
dustry and caution? Never in this world!
Jacob knew it. Truly a good wife was “far
above rubies” —or diamonds, for that matter.
And he had begrudged her the earrings she
wanted —Anna, his queen, the mother of his
six fine children.
By the morning Jacob had capitulated.
“Anna,” he said, “if so be you are set on
those earrings I will make a bid for
them.”
Anna smiled again. “Don’t I know you
would? But what made you so funny about
it last night? Isn’t business so good?”
“Yes, not too bad ; but it’s this way. The
new shop in Pitt-street is only beginning to
pay, and I had to put down spot cash for
that big bankrupt stock I bought last week,
and what with the overhead”
“Overhead? I said you paid too much
for those roof repairs.”
“So with one thing and _ another, the
accountant, him that comes in to do the
books, says they don’t tot up so well as
they did last month, and what that goy don’t
know about figures ain’t worth counting. So
you see, Anna, even if business is good, fer-
nanslially I’m to the bad.”
“If it’s like as you say, Jacob, I can do
without any more jewellery; and per-
haps”—
“Maybe I get you the diamond earrings.”
“Listen, Jacob. I have a ruby and filigree
necklet your grandmother gave me for a
wedding present. It ain’t seen daylight
since I had it. What’s the use of it laying
by any longer? You might put it into auc-
tion, and what we get for it can go towards
the earrings.”
“What’ll it fetch?”
“Lord knows. These things were out of
fashion before I was born.”
“Well, give it to me and I will drop it at
Ellis’s to-day.”
On the following Friday Jacob asked Anna
to give an eye to the store, as he would be
out best part of the day. “Franks, from
Melbourne, is calling for me in his car, and
we’re going to the auction-rooms.”
“I don’t think it looks well for a respect-
able married man to be going about with
that Franks.”
“What’s the matter with him? Ain’t he
a respectable married man, too? Why should
I believe bad things of a man so obliging
with his car?”
On the way Franks asked Jacob if there
was anything he was specially interested in
at Ellis’s.
“He’s offering some jewellery I might bid
for.”
“If there’s anything in that line given
away I might have a shot at it, too,” laughed
Franks.
“For your wife?”
“One of ’em.”
This was Franks’s stock joke; but how
was Abelson to know? For a man to assume
a vice though he had it not w r as a reversal
of Jacob’s simple code of morals. Anna was
right, then; Franks W’as a bad ’un and
deserved nothing good of nobody. »

mentioning “The Bulletin’* of February 25.
“Seen the stuff?” asked Franks.
“Some of it.”
“Any good?”
“There’s a ruby and filigree necklet that's
supposed to be something extra. It’s handed
down.”
“An antique?”
“That’s it.”
“How do you know it’s genuine?”
“Durant told me, and lie’s the best judge
of antiques in Sydney.”
“Yes; I know Durant.”
That was surprising, for Jacob had just
created him.
“Will you bid for this necklet?”
“Me? No; jewellery ain’t in my line —
except when I buy a bit on commission—
like to-day.”
When Mr. Abelsou and his friend reached
the auction rooms a picture-sale was in pro-
gress and Ellis was in the rostrum. He
was a tall, thin man, quick-tempered and sar-
castic, yet the most popular man in his line
in Sydney. Ilis slogan, “Ellis can sell it,”
was justified. In spite of an overbearing
manner and a habit of addressing person-
alities to his audience, his rooms were well
attended and the sales brisk.
“Lot 52,” he was saying. “Here is a fine
copy in oils of a famous picture, ‘September
Morn.’ Ah-h !” ecstatically, “what a lovely
creature ! Plucky, too ! She has ventured
out to bathe on this chilly morning when
e'veryoue else is in bed. Can’t you fancy
you see her at Bondi or Manly?”
A voice: “No; she’d get pinched.”
“Pizness, Mr. Ellis,” called a short, fat
man impatiently. “Vot about that shewellery
you was to put up at twelf? It’s alreaty
a quarter past.”
“What’s your hurry, Vanleer?” asked Ellis.
“The Derby doesn’t run till 2.40 to-morrow.”
“My troubles apout der Derby. I come
here for to do pizness, not to listen to your
yokes. Yen I vant to see a funny man I
buy myself a seat at the Tivoli.”
“When I want to see a funny man I look
at you and it costs me nothing.”
But Mr. Vanleer’s .protest evidently had
some effect. Ellis proceeded with less per-
siflage, only indulging in such humor as
was necessary in the interests of business.
“Where’s that necklet you were telling
me about?” asked Franks.
“In the case over there. One of the men
’ll show it to you.”
Franks went across the room.
“Who’s your flash friend?” inquired a
young man, a new chum in the sale rooms.
“He isn't a friend; only a man I met in
business.”
“What’s he after?”
“Search me, Ansell, he ain’t said any-
thing to me, but I see he’s looking at that
necklet that’s to be offered to-day.”
“What necklet?”
“Didn’t you know? Supposed to be some-
thing unique. If it is. Franks will be after
it. He’s a shrewdv, all right.”
“Looks more a sucker to me; but you
never can tell. I'll go and take a squint at
it.”
Ansell went to look at the necklet and
Franks came back.
“See him.” said Jacob, pointing to An-
sell. “He's the most cleverest buyer I know.”
“Is that so? And what does he deal in?”
“Antiques and curios. And I tell you
he don't let anything good get by him.”
“He's examining that necklet pretty
closely.” said Franks.
Jacob seemed impressed. “Closely, is
he? Must be something out of the way—he
wouldn't look twice at ordinary stuff.”
“How much do you think it will sell for?”
“Not less than a coupler hundred.”
Franks did not want the necklet, but to
be in a saleroom without bidding seems as
flat as going to the races and not betting.
“Anyhow,” he said, “if that chap you say is
so smart bids for it, give me the tip. I
don’t want him to know I’m following
him.”
“All right, I’ll give you the wink if you
stand this side of me. What’s the number?”
“86.”
“Lots of time yet.” Franks went round
the room examining odd pieces of furniture.
“I don’t know if that filigree necklet is
anything extra,” said Ansell to Jacob.
“You ain’t got to know. You go by them
that does know. Didn’t Sammons only the
other day make a hundred quid out of an
old man’s portrait he didn’t know from a
bar of soap?”
“Well, see here. Jacob. If that man bids,
give me the office.”
The necklet was put up for sale and the
bidding started. So did the nudges and
winks of Jacob. Sometimes Ansell got the
wink and Franks the nudge; but the result
was the same. Their eagerness was infec-
tious, and brought other offers, a few genu-
ine, but mostly from those whose business it
is to egg on flagging buyers. Rumors
flew round the room. The necklet had been
stolen from the Czarina. It was a rare ex-
ample of Byzantine work. It was found in
Tut’s tomb.
When the offering went above a hundred
pounds Ansell dropped out. “Let him have
it,” he whispered to Jacob. “He’s got a
market for it. I got to find mine.”
Franks was a vain man, and enjoyed the
interest he aroused by his persistent bidding,
but he had no intention of paying for his
pleasure. He intended to stop well before
Abelson’s estimate was reached. Therefore
he was a surprised man when Ellis called
out: “A hundred and twenty. No further
offers?” then, looking at him: “Sold to you,
sir.”
“You told me it would fetch two hundred
pounds.” muttered Franks to Jacob.
“Well, you’re eighty to the good.”
“And a hundred and twenty to the bad.”
That was the most important sale of the
day. The next was a pair of diamond ear-
rings (in velvet case), sold to Jacob Abelson
for a hundred pounds—the reserved price—
which he duly presented to a delighted wife.
That night Abelson was again restless.
“What’s wrong, Jacob?” asked Anna ten-
derly. “Maybe the gerfilter fish don’t agree
with you so well nowadays?”
“It’s not that so much, Anna, but I’m
thinking my grandmother would turn in her
grave if she could see her necklet on Franks’s
shicksa.”
“Don’t worry, Jacob. Buba loved a bar-
gain. If she saw the fine diamonds we got
in place of it she’d turn back again.”
Trust Anna to set things right.
“Far above rubies,” murmured Jacob
sleepily.
“Miles!” agreed Anna.
MARCO.
One Night Stands.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EAST of the Warrego is the prickly-
pear; let the cactus cross the War-
rego decisively, and the Far West
is in great danger. I know of no long motor
journey more depressing than the journeys
in South Central Queensland through the
pear, its fiat fingers ever reaching out after
more good land; this vegetable, that loves
shaded park-like country as the octopus loves
the sea caves, making a new colony at the
bole of every belar and gidgee until the
islands of growth are concrescent. Through
that mass of pear the road snakes red against
the green, fleshy pear -invading the track of
the car-wheels, and by them crushed yellow.
The great plains of the Far West and of
Central Australia, sun-drenched and appa-
rently interminable, are majestic; mental de-
pression is the effect in pear country. This
undeportable immigrant, covering the good
land with its aggressive uselessness, makes
the outlook almost hopeless even to the man
riding rapidly through it in a good car. To
move through it slowly by the old method
of riding-horse and pack-horse in its present
spread would almost make suicide feasible
to a quick-thinking man.
It was the night of my first meeting in the
pear country, where the fat black soil was being
covered and eaten by the fatter green; yet
a country so prosperous that one could
imagine its productiveness were the cactus
finished with. The thick violet night aided
the illusion of the pest closing in on us as
an invading army; in the dawn it seemed
as if it had crept a little nearer as in an-
cient wars the tortoise and its hidden soldiers
used the darkness to creep closer to the wall
of the city besieged.
Yet all men settled there told a prosper-
ous story—the story of Australia, The Un-
beatable. Well for it that it is, seeing that
it has had to run against the handicap of
all the pests that stupidity could import.
The pommyising of the Australian daily press
has had no more direct expression than the
publication of a long cable from London on
a. disputation as to the identity of the first
fool who introduced rabbits to Australia.
One Collison claimed the dubious “credit,”
and one Thatcher claims that his papa was
responsible. And of all the Australian
papers that printed if not one mentioned the
fact that when the claim is settled the
winner, if alive, should be entitled to be
hanged with all Australia’s bill for rabbit-
netting tied to his feet.
Through the pear again to the north ; and,
as guest, a man who had been looking on the
rum when it was black, and was now a fit
companion to dragons and a brother to owls.
He told his one story infinitely often, and
ran a dead heat with the prickly-pear in
the Monotony Stakes. This, with a thousand
variations so slight that the monotony was
not once relieved.
“He ses ter me, ‘Call y’self a Labor man,’
he ses; ‘go an’ get whitewashed.’ ‘Tell me
what for.’ I ses. ‘Because y\ shore a-Sun-
day.’ ‘Me not a Labor man? Me go an’
get whitewashed? Because I shore a-Sun-
day. Why did I shear a-Sunday? Tell y’
why—because me mate got a sprained wrist
an’ I shore ten nannies fer ’im—jus’ fer love.
An’ he ses, ‘Go an’ get whitewashed!’ Just
because I shore ten nannies because me mate
had a sprained wrist.”
And so on for 50 miles. Well might Well-
ington wish for Blucher or night.
* *• * *
Down the Balonne and into the pear coun-
try again; and then south by night to the
N.S.W. border; and, after the meeting,
through the pear north again to the railway,
reached when Monday was but two hours
old. Meetings on railway stations during
train stops; afternoon runs off the railroad;
meetings in coach towns and back to the
railway by midnight; Sunday morning meet-
ings in picture theatres; a jump to Too-
woomba, and a vacation on a freight train
to Brisbane ; then an all-day journey to the
Granite; there to thank God for heavy rain
that helped the primary producer and pre-
vented the meeting.
At the end of one of these week-long and
week-end excursions, I, being weary of the
sound of the human voice, and particularly
of my own, bought at a country store all
the literature offering—Maurice Hewlett,
which was good; Rider Haggard, w r hich was
endurable; and Ethel M. Dell, which was
merely better than talking.
But my campaign-mate w-ould not be
denied, and, accepting the inevitable, I tried
to read while he talked. Suddenly out of
the gossip came a story, told with an appear-
ance of earnest humorlessness which was in
itself funhy, and in a small voice that con-
tradicted the physique of the talker.
“Y’ know the township of Claypan?” he
asked.
“Of course.”
“Well, I knew it before ever you knew
the Warrego, or the Warrego knew you.”
“I thought you weren’t to talk at meet-
ings ?”——
“You’re not a meeting.... not even a
quorum. Well, out there there were riots.
Oh. donkey’s years ago. There was a man
named Sandy Taft, a beautiful-looking man.
He had a lovely moustache and a splendid
beard—all virgin ; never had a razor on his
face.”
“A Nazarene.”
“Yes. What they call Beardies, or Chris-
tian Israelites. But he wasn’t a Christian
Israelite. He was a bonzer Australian and
a very pretty shearer. Well, these riots.
They were real riots, and the leaders got six
months each. Sandy Taft among them.
Sandy was terrible anxious about his whis-
kers, and he offered the offsider at the gaol
a hundred quid to keep the razor quiet. It
was a terrible thing, but they shaved him.
Poor Sandy died about two years after his
sentence ended.”
“A new Samson?”
“No. I don’t think shaving him wad alto-
gether the cause of his death. Y’ see, during
the riot, Tim Delahunty—a blacksmith and
a big lump of a man about seven-feet-nine,
and nearly as thick —hit poor Sandy over the
kidneys with a dray-axle. That might have
had something to do with his death.”
So then I put my books away.

THE
“ATCO”
ALL-BRITISH PETROL MOTOR-MOWER.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of ah acre or more, members ot
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.
Sold in two sizes—l6-inch cutters, £7l; 22-inch cutters, £lO5 complete.
