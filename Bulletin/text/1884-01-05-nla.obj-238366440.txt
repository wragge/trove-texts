To Lord Rosebery.
Tub visit of the Earl of Rosebery to New
South Wales has been made an event of, and
considerable stress has been, in various
quarters, both public and private, laid upon
the importance of the impressions which
that nobleman shall carry back to the
mother country. We have till now pre-
served an attitude of observation, as it is
not our humour to jump at the conclusion
that because a man has a title and a fortune
his opinion must necessarily be worth
troubling about. There is just about the
same proportion of confounded fools among
peers as among plebeians, and it might have
happened that Lord Rosebery was one of
the fools. Even the fact that he had for a
short time held a minor office in Mr.
Gladstone’s administration was not con-
clusive to the contrary. Men are chosen
for office for one of two reasons—because
they have inherited influence by the acci-
dent of birth, or because they have
acquired it by their talents. Lord Rose-
bery—an Earl—might be a Minister, and
yet a man of small personal ability. Of Mr.
Rosebery, plebeian and minister, distin-
guished talent might be expected. But
observation of the deportment and utter-
ances of Lord Rosebery since he has been
amongst us has established a conviction
that he possesses abilities equal to his recent
political position. He has sustained the
somewhat trying ordeal of sycophantic
glorification with a bland composure and
dexterous aplomb which prove him capable
of dealing with men ; and his speeches have
been characterised by a discretion and saga-
city that justify the importance which has
been, more from a servile instinct than from
knowledge of his actual qualities, attached
to his visit and to his impressions. A gushing
politician assured us, the other day, that
Lord Rosebery had a great deal to do with
the recent success of our three million loan.
We are not disposed to coincide with this
enthusiastic attribution of providential po-
tency to the Earl. Had we lived in the time
of the Napoleonic scare, we think we should
not have been among those who attributed
to “Bony” every evil which afflicted the
age, from the rising of four-pound loaves
and Lcnnites, to the irruption of large
blue flies into butchers’ shops. And, at the
present time, we are not disposed to attri-
bute to the talents and presence of Lord
Rosebery the floating of the loan, the pink-
ness of the sunset skies, or the increased
production of wool. But we do, now that
we have got the measure of the man, agree
that the opinions which he, as one born to
rank and affluence, and elevated to some
political influence, may form here, and
express on his return to England, may have
considerable influence, for good or evil, upon
our affairs, political and financial.
• # «
Consequently, we regard it as worth while
to make a few remarks for his Lordship’s
special information, and as a corrective to a
good deal of flummery which has been
poured into his ears. The Earl will
readily understand that he has come into
close contact chiefly with two sorts of colo-
nists; gentlemen who have been able to
maintain here the rank and condition to
which they were born in the old country—a
very small band—and persons who have
attained a local status, due to official posi-
tion, or success in public life, or in money-
making. In addition, a small, but not in
this case altogether insignificant, class may
be noticed—the men who make it the business *
of their lives to dangle after persons of pro-
minence, local or imported; men who are
nothing themselves, yet who go everywhere;
are at every Ministerial picnic, at every
banquet, on every complimentary commit-
tee, and who figure magnificently at land-
sale luncheons.
t i •
It is scarcely possible that Lord Rosebery
can have learned to distinguish and classify
the different sorts of men who have been
hovering round him. And if the impressions
he "will carry away are to he these which he
has framed from reflection upon the opinions
pressed upon him. these impressions are
likely to be as remarkable for their variety
as for their unsoundness. It has been re-
marked of the aborigines of this continent
that they have an extraordinary aptitude
for adjusting the information they give so
as to suit what they conceive will be agree-
able to their questioner. Something of the
same sort attaches to the nature of our
tuft-hunters and toadies. They are greatly
given to embody in their remarks, when
sunning themselves in the gratifying pre-
sence of a distinguished visitor, and glowing
with a derived glory, a preternatural gen-
tility, and an extraordinary fervour of at-
tachment to the old country and to—well>
to anything else likely to be approved by
His Lordship. And, unluckily, this trait is
not entirely confined to the tribe of lick-
spittles and parvenu gentilities. It affects
in a modified degree much superior men.
The proportion of persons likely to have
direct dealings with a nobleman on a visit,
who have from their earliest years, as a
matter of right and of course, been accus-
tomed to rub shoulders with English gentle-
men on terms of easy equality, is not very
large; and of those who have been hail-
fellow-well-met with Peers, the number is
infinitesimally small. There is consequently
a wide-spread, natural, and distinctly proper
desire, even on the part of men of inde-
pendent temper and self-respecting dignity,
to make things pleasant and conversation
smooth for a visitor of high rank. Hence
we think that Lord Rosebery is in some
danger of carrying away somewhat lop-sided
ideas about colonial affairs and colonists
dispositions.
* • *
We judge it unlikely, for example, that
anyone has informed him that in the esti-
mation of a considerable proportion of the
colonists, Her Majesty the Queen has been
grossly ill-advised as to the distribution of
the distinctions which it has been the Im-
perial policy to distribute among prominent
public men. “ A considerable proportion of
the colonists” is a vague term. Its vague-
ness insures its correctness. Whether the
proportion constitutes a majority or not, it
is impossible to say with certainty. But the
fact is unchallengeable. It is the view of a
multitude of person* that, in the first place,
the institution of a special Order of St.
Michael and St. George for the behoof of
colonists is regarded less as an instance of
Royal consideration and favour than as an
affront, signifying that pre-existing Orders
would be disgraced or depreciated by ad-
mitting to them persons so vulgar and in-
considerable as mere colonials. It is not
probable that Lord Rosebery has been
informed that the dispositions of colonists,
with respect to this question of distinctions,
are various but definable; that there are
people who are attached to aristocratic
institutions, as to orthodoxy in other matters,
by the force of training and habit, indura-
ted into a sentimental affection; that
there are among these some who dis-
criminate sufficiently to resent the ex-
press reservation from colonial worthies,
of all the historical orders and distinc-
tions, and the special provision of
a new, shabby, and gimcrack order into
which any sort of man may be pitchforked,
that there are others so docile that even a
buffet from a royal hand would delight
them, and who would rather be used
as a royal spittoon than not regally noticed
at all; that, on the other hand, there are
among the colonists people who have
learned to appreciate the civil and social
equality'.which was so long permitted to
prevail here; and who view with repug-
nance any design to transplant hither class
distinctions, and with pleasure the ludicrous
miscarriage which has attended such at-
tempts thus far.
♦ ♦ ♦
Itfis scarcely likely that anyone has so
violated the supposed convenances as to
apprise the ex-member of Her Majesty’s
Government of the particulars in which the
allotment of honours has nullified the
intention of the distribution. No one,
perhaps, has told him that the most distin-
guished Order of St. Michael and St.
George is, in New South Wales at least, a
thing for men to gibe at* in consequence of
some astounding blunders and many in-
stances of supercilious carelessness in the
distribution of its grades. It may
almost be said that the mischief—or
benefit—thus wrought is irreparable,
and that in future no colonist who
respects himself or values the regard of his
fellow-colonists will consent to be saddled
with the indignity of affiliation .with a dis-
graced and depreciated Order. Had Her
Majesty been advised to select for marks of
distinction our noblest men, democratic
sentiments in these colonies would have re-
ceived a rude shock. Had her Ministers
submitted to her even the names of men
who—whatever their merits and character-
had been elevated to frequent distinction
by the colonists themselves, there would
have been little opportunity for scoffing.
The colonists would then have felt that the
responsibility was their own. But when,
by incomprehensible means, individuals
held not only in light regard, but in abso-
lute contempt and derision, were singled
out for distinction, the honour failed to
elevate the individual, while the individual
abased the entire Order, and—by a natural
connection —all Orders.
• • •
We don’t suppose anybody has whispered
this to Lord Rosebery, but it is useful in-
formation for him. And it will be advan-
tageous for him, also, to convey to his late
colleagues, in addition to the advice that
things have been so bungled in this respect
that no one now is bidding for Companion-
ships and Knighthoods except persons who
are devoid of self-respect,—and therefore
the very men to still further depre-
ciate the unlucky Order—the know-
ledge that it will not be wise to con-
tinue to evince, with respect to the selec-
tion of Governors for these colonies, the
, same contemptuous indifference which has

occasionally been evinced during the past
few years. Australian colonists are pretty
strongly tinctured with democratic senti-
ments—even outside Victoria, that commu-
nity of downright radicals; and when they
see, in two important instances, evidence
that an idea is acted upon by Her Majesty’s
advisers that anything is good enough for
Australians, resentment will take root in
many minds, and find an outlet at some
critical moment when a generally favour-
able disposition is requisite and desirable to
soften some sharp conflict of interests be-
tween the colonies and the mother country.
It will be useful, therefore, that Lord Rose-
bery should carry back the information
that there exists considerable discontent
respecting the quality of some of the men
who have been sent out to represent Her
Majesty, as Governors of Australian colonies.
The colonists are neither fools nor children-
They are perfectly competent to take the
measure of any man sent out to them as
Governor —have a keen appreciation of
an able man, and an equally lively per-
ception of a feeble one. The latter
feeling is not usually so definitely and
freely expressed as the former. Panegyric
of an able Governor is a form of expression
which may be advantageously and unre-
servedly vented,'while criticism of a feeble
or unsuitable man must always be tempered
by a variety of causes and considerations.
Adulation of any sort of man occupying a
position which gives him command of social
prestitjc, and influence in a variety of ways,
will always flow readily from a multitude of
mean mouths, whether the man be worthy
or not of praise. And a reluctance to hurt
the feelings of a possibly harmless and ami-
able individual will operate to restrain all
but very independent, very determined, or
very conscientious persons who feel that
they [have a duty in the matter. In New
South Wales the impress made within recent
times by one very able man upon public
affairs, and the impulse imparted by him to
necessary progression when neglected by a
wrangling local Government, is too strongly
borne in mind by the colonists, and too
keenly appreciated, for weaker rule to pass
without criticism and reprobation. There
is work in Australia for the best and most
energetic men the mother country can spare;
an# nothing could more surely tend to lessen
the present appreciation of the value of the
Imperial connection than persistence in the
practice of making the position of Governor
in these colonies a provision for the needy
dependents of Her Majesty’s Ministers, or of
treating these posts as asylums for the ex-
hausted energies, and recruiting-grounds for
the empty purses, of used-up diplomats or
needy cadets of noble houses.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Clontarfists Supreme.
The impunity which followed the ravishers and
murderers of Elizabeth Phillips has borne its
natural fruit with startling rapidity, and the
savages of Waterloo now contest the eminence of
brutalism with the savages of Woolloomooloo
Wo are no advocates for capital punishments’
which, as enforced, in many Instances extinguish
lives that have unexhausted value in them. But
there are certainly some wretches that seem to be
—with all reverence for the creative Omniscience
be it said-unfit to live. There are, however, two
ways of looking at the case. Detection and punish-
ment being anything but certain, it is doubtful
whether casual examples, caught by hazard, would
really act as deterrent to future offences. Eliza-
beth Phillips lost her life in consequence of
rambling about the purlieus of the city after
nightfall, In an Intoxicated condition. But other
women had similarly wandered, and no ill had
happened to them: and therefore the fale Of
Phillips did not prevent Owen from courting a
like destruction. The bestial classes are, like
many others, outgrowing existing arrangements.
They commence to get ahead of the conventional
procedures of the police organization, and have
learned the truth that evidence respecting certain
obscene offences is impossible of procurement,
provided all concerned unite in keeping their
mouths shut. In the case of Elizabeth Phil-
lips, the conspiracy to suppress all evidence has
thus far proved too fine for the police; and the
time-words, dodges, and devices of detectives—a
body of men who move just as much by rote as
any other—have been played out. Should a simi-
lar result follow the more recent case at AVaterloo
the situation will be grave, indeed. The
evil of it would be well out-compensated if the
escape of offenders acted as a restraint upon
women as to abuse of stimulants and heedlessness
of wanderings. But, unluckily, it seems almost
inevitable that triumphant barbarism, elated by
its repeated Immunity, would try still more awful
exploits, and crown its iniquities by treating as
jt has treated outcasts some pure and respectable
girl, belated by the necessities of business or the
operation of chance. As regards the possibility of
obtaining evidence to convict, there would be no
difference. Dead girls tell no talcs, any more than
dead hags. If over there was an incident which
demanded the most strenuous exertions of the
authorities, and an entire disregard of means or
expense, the present supplies one. Unless the
career of ruffianism bo absolutely quelled by an
example which will strike (error into the hearts of
all ruffians, and blast their present idea of pro-
bable immunity, by evidence that there is no bond
of scoundrelism so strong that the arm of the law
cannot shiver it, and no secrecy so strict that it
cannot be probed and laid bare, there will be but
two alternatives. Decent women, and presently
decent men, will hayg t<? Seep indoors after dark
or only move in parties; or vigilance committees
and lynch-law will have to take the regulation of
public order out of the Impotent hands of regular
authority.
A Twopenny Hurricane.
It is inspiriting to observe that only proper occa-
sion is necessary to prove that the grand old
British spirit is not defunct. Itesidents of suburbs
along the railway line are up in arms with a manly
and vigorous insurrection against the plundering
proposals of a tyrannical Government. The noble
impatience of wrong, the keen appreciation of
constitutional rights, the self-sacriflcing devotion
to an abstract principle which stirred our sires to
a determined resistance of ship-money in the time
of Charles I., the resentment at extraordinary
imposts which armed the hand and steeled the
heart of Wat Tyler, are repeated by the stout
burgesses of Burwood and the heroic cltize n s of
Ashfleld and Petersham. Led and inspired by such
doughty and desperate heroes as Jimmy Inqlis,
these worthy scions of a patriotic ancestry rise in
their might, and evince their grand determination
to do and dare to the bitter end in a momentous
question—of tuppence-ha'penny! They threaten
the Government of the country with their direst
displeasure, concert plans for overwhelming the
Minister with persistent deputations, and gene-
rally work themselves into a condition of magnifi-
cent indignation, which would be appalling to
tyrants, were the whole business not so very
like a panic created by tho popping of
a glngerbeer bottle. It is a notable fact that more
fuss has neon made by suburban residents about
the additional charge of a fraction of one penny
sterling per day for their conveyance, than there
was when, a short time ago, the pretensions of the
Judges threatened to extinguish the right Cf
journalists to expose impostures and to warn the
public against rogues. The plain fact of this
season-ticket matter is that the charges have been
as compared with tho cost of necessaries of life in
this country, absurdly low and inadequate. When
the Eastern suburbs were in course of growth,
much of the land was c wned by speculators and
proprietors who worked tho oracle so that low
fares should be scheduled, and thus high values
obtained for lots of land. The rates should never
have been so low. They were unfair to the rest of
the community—outside suburban residents. The
Minister and the Commissioner have done
what was right, tardily enough, and may stick to
their decision, assured that although there may
ensue a storm in a loyal Indian teapot, and in
other utensils, the people of the country generally
will hail the approach to fair charges, where
ridiculous partiality and actual jobbery has here-
tofore prevailed.
Two Reputations.
If Sir John Robertson knows, or fancies he
knows, anything against Captain Armstrong,
lately Resident Magistrate on Lord Howe’s
Island, he had best out with it like a man. He need
not be frightened to speak out the meaning of his
taunts. The privilege he enjoys as a legislator
protects him in the one case as thoroughly as in the
other. Even that privilege, however, is impotent
to protect from contempt a man who persists in
stabbing the reputation of another with taunts
and innuendoes. As a legislative character-
assassin Mr. M'Elhone is much to be preferred to
Sir John Robertson. The former, at any rate,
although he like the latter skulks behind bales of
privilege, deals downright blows and shows his
weapon, and where he means his hits to fall.
Sir John, on the contrary, deals out sly
digs which he gives his victim no chance of parry-
ing. As regards Captain Armstrong’s conduct
when Resident Magistrate at Lord Howe’s Island,
there has been full and public inquiry, with the
effect that the Captain stands distinctly acquitted
of aught save such minor indiscretions in distri-
buting stimulants as the best intentioned and
most upright man in the world might have fallen
into. Considering, in fact, how imperfect is the
performance of appointed duties by every man
the clean record which the quite malignant
investigation into Captain Armstrong’s tenure
of practically irresponsible power on the i land
brought to light is quite remarkable. Foiled,
apparently, by this result, Sir John Robert-
son hints that Captain Armstrong was a
good riddance to the Navy. The Captain
replies by publishing credentials of which
any man might be proud, apparently cover-
ing every day of his career in the
service. AVhat has Sir John now to say?
He has done his best to mortally wound Cap-
tain Armstrong’s character. It is incumbent
upon him now to show that Captain Armstrong’s
testimonials do not avail. Failing this, Sir John
himself stands liable to bo challenged as having
struck a foul blow as well as a cowardly one. Let
him clear himself. Captain Armstrong is very
little to the people of New South AVales generally,
albeit the character of an apparently gallant
officer and straightforward man is a precious
thing anywhere. But Sir John’s own reputation
is of much concern to our people. As matters
stand, he has so managed his attacks upon the
Captain that, rightly or wrongly, it is his own
reputation as that of an honourable and manly
individual, which is at present in the worst plight.

Colonel Siedicken, of the St. Petersburg

last. “No doubt is entertained,” says the Rusky

This extremely piquant production professes to
describe the inside story of the betrothal, mar-
riage and matrimonial experiences of one Paulette,
who is a wonderfully innocent girl. On the stage,
the interesting Paulette is shown in her wedding
dress, in the nuptial chamber, and fitting her form
to her robes in the sanctum of the fashionable
modiste. Hosts of the many delicate little mat-
ters, feminine and matrimonial, are revealed which
have always been hitherto considered irrevealable.
The actress who plays the ingenuous part of Paul-
ette drosses and undresses on the stage several
times, to the huge delight of the bald-headed old
sinners in the stalls and balcony. In another act,

nearly nude as possible. The ladies throughout
the play wear real diamonds, real stockings, cor-
sets, dress-improvers, pads, and—show them.
Edinburgh is heir presumptive to the
Duchy of Coburg. Every year he and his wife
pass some time there, where they established
friendly relations with the reigning Duke. But
the whole of the fat is at present in the fire, and
this is how it happened. It was Edinburgh’s missus’
birthday, and the wives of two court officials were
signi'icantly omitted from the invitation to the
customary “hop”—one because she had been an
actress, and the other because she had been di-
vorced from her form er husband. So the husbands,
as in duty bound, took up the cause of their slighted
ladies, and appealed to the reigning Duke of
Coburg. He pleaded their cause, but Her B. High-
ness of Edinburgh is so dreadfully strict in these
matters (it runs in the family) that he might just
as well whistle jigs to a milestone. Chagrined with
the failure of his efforts, he gaVe orders that none
of the court officials of Coburg should attend the
“blow out.” He was obeyed, and the Czar’s
daughter’s “swairy” fell as flat as the front line
of Yankees at Bull’s Run. AVe regrer, of course,
that H.R.H. should be disappointed, but ourregret
is tempered with admiration at her firm resolution
to keep in their proper places low, forward people,
who at one time had actually to earn their own
living. Once let it get wind that actors, actresses,
and such rubbish can be shot at people’s doors,
and find their way to the drawing-room, and we
shall shortly hear of journalists—even in N.S.AY.—
presuming to mix with their betters. The line
must bo drawn somewhere.
A cable message to the daily papers tells
us that Sir John Bayley Darvall is dead. The
other day the 8. M. Herald reprinted a letter,
recently written to the London Times, by “J.B.D.,”
from the tone of which it was quite evident that
the intellect of Sir John Bayley Darvall was in a
moribund condition; and such beingthecase.it
could hardly be expected that his physical decease
could long bo postponed. Sir J. B. Darvall has,
for years and years, been one of the antiquated
fossils on the top shelves of that most respectable
and ponderous body, the “Royal Colonial Insti-
tute, 5 ’ where his utterances appear to have
been considered oracular, if we are to judge
by the readiness with which the Times, a
journal that evidently knows as much about

But Sir John Bayley Darvall was once young, and
when he was younger he lived in Sydney, where
he formed one of the first Ministry under Re-
sponsible Government. He was a dandy of the
first water, the best-dressed man in Sydney, a
clever advocate, more cynical than solid. He was
too much of a man of pleasure to do anything
likely to leave its impress on the land of his
adoption. He seems chiefly to be remembered by
one anecdote we have often heard as to the man-
ner in which he, while opposing Mr. Henry Parkes
at Maitland, launched out at that virtuous poli-
tician. Daintily tucking up his immaculate short
cuffs, he said that he was about to approach a very
dirty subject, which was his reason for pulling up
his sleeves after the manner of surgeons on the
point of dissecting bodies which were not fresh.
The dirty subject in question, he need hardly tell
them, was the political character of Mr. Parkes.
Sir Henry, according to the cablegram, attended
Sir J. B, Darvall’s funeral—rather, we presume,
as a mark ot respect to a political opponent than
as a token of regard to an old friend.
Mr. David Syme.
Mu, David Syme is the chief proprietor of the
Age. We have no materials at hand from which
to extract an account of his birth, parentage,
country, religious persuasion, or physical peculi-
arities, so that we are obliged to pass silently over
his earlier years, and leave unrecorded the many
trenchant remarks he no doubt made when
the Trinitarian doctrine was first brought under
ms notice at Sunday-school, or the economical
theories of Bastiat an Mill attracted his attention.
It is with the David Syme of the Age we have to
deal. There is no denying that under him that
journal has attained a unique position. This is the
more to be surprised at from the fact that it
champions economical views, which, forty years
ago, were supposed to be torn into tatters by a
system of reasoning as inexorable as that of
Euclid s .demonstrations. It has been whispered
that David s economical beliefs are diametrically
opposed to those his paper advocates, and it has
been more than whispered that the exceptionally
powerful protectionist articles in his journal were
written by men who think the citadel of freetrado
Impregnable. We cannot say. What we can say
is 1 hat, while covering with ridicule the blind, un-
disciplined efforts of Irish peasants to escape from
an agrarian thraldom which has disappeared from
most European countries, the Age supported,
through good report and evil, the efforts of Mr.
Berry to prevent the passing of the public estate
into a few bands. While admiring* the enterpris-
ing spirit that has secured for bis journal the
premier position in Australia, we cannot ignore
the fact that he has placed his columns at the dis-
posal of those who. if they had the power, would
acclimatise in this young country the political
and religious animosities which have so disfigured
the old.
“Atlas, of the World, is mad with
Parkes for having', when Premier of N.S.W

capable of executing a statue.”
“Professor” Holloway gone where pills are
not taken and where ointment does not work
through and heal. R.I.P. He knew how to ad-
vertise. His pibs are considered by hosts of
people about the bestgeneral purgative ever com-
pounded, while his ointment has never been sur-
passed as a simple application for a variety of in-
flammations, and so forth. Holloway succeeded
because, he made more show than men with much
superior opportunities, and also because the
science of medicine was in his earlier days in so
inchoate a condition that mild drugs which might
cure, and couldn’t kill, had a tremendous advan-
tage over the murderous compounds with which
until very recently, it was the habit of regular
practitioners to drench patients.
The largest crowd that ever gathered
on the Association Ground was there on New
Year’s Day. The whole area was a black mass of
beings come to see the Highland Sports. And they
were treated to plenty. Fifty events! It was a
family crowd, of people who came rather to sec
than be seen; and we won’t particularise the
toilets. There were too many to try it; indivi-
duality was sunk in the immense total. They
enjoyed it, or they wouldn’t have stopped, as most
did, to the last. Renfrew, from Newcastle, is a
“terror.” A man who can struggle all day at
nearly everything named sport and continually
“take the pie” must be phenomenal. He is.
Wrestling on the turf was an innovation on pre-
vious years, and caused great interest. In addition
to the prize dancing, a number of exquisitely
trained little dancers (by Mrs. Warskitt) performed
flings, jigs, &c., with beautiful accuracy and grace
of motion. Merry-go-rounds and all sorts of
diversions carried on a trade, and the entire pro-
gramme was well managed. By the vast atten-
dance, the Highland Society must have netted a.
great deal, and possibly each individual kilted
member will now find himself rich enough to buy
a pair of what’s wanted between his skirts and his
stockings.

exceptions, and braved the elements with
shoulders bare and their feet encased in satin
slippers. Veryjfow carried umbrellas. There was
not a dry eye in the streets.” Later on, the writer
recounts how the princess, determined to share
the shower-bath of her most loyal subjects,
lowered her own umbrella, and bared her royal
bang to the elements. “ It is notsurprising, there-
fore, that the multitude, for the twentieth time,
burst Into a flood of tears.” . . . Tho Queen's

The last Court society scandal in Vienna
Is of a supremely delicate nature. Tho court phy-

who has just undergone her first ordeal of mater-
nity, will most likely never entirely recover from
her efforts on that oecasion, owing to a permanent
ailment she has contracted. This ailment, the
medical men aver, after close examination, can
have been caught in no other way that through
the inexcusable omission of certain duties by
Countess Nostiz, mistress of the chamber, when
making her personal preparations for the Royal
accouchement. And it is felt, by those who know
most of the circumstances, that the disastrous
neglect of duty was not accidental, but purposed.
For tho beautiful Stephanie once seriously af-
fronted the Countess, who has in this way sought
a terrible revenge. Countess Nostiz has been
banished from tho Court.
Probate ivas granted last week to the will

have no desire to cite against him. It may be
that tho outside world, where so many must nave
gone to tho wall to enable Mr. Officer to pile up
such a sum, deserved a better remembrance than
tho £7750 he distributed over tho field of " Benevo-
lence.” For no man makes much money without
having made many men very poor. But Mr.
Officer was not wholly unmindful of the outside
world, wherein he loft this £7750. What wo think,
however, is that ho distributed it on altogether
erronneous linos. To charities, in the wav of
schools, orphanages, and hospitals, he bequeathed
£3350; while, to Bible societies, churches, and
theological halls, he devoted£5500. Evidently Mr.
Officer was a theorist with regard to human suffer-
ing. We don't like going after the dead man, but
wo think that with his later practical experience
the £5500 would have gone where the £3350 went.

That astute and active young Irish-Aus-
tralian, Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, evidently knows
how many beans make five. He has only been
about 15 months out of his shell in our political
world: but during that period he has contrived
to get and keep a front place in the ranks ot de-
mocracy. and to play upon every popular chord
which vibrates in New South Wales-the rights of
labour, native industries, eight hour's principle,
restriciiou of coloured labour, land reform, pay-
ment of members, and a federal republic for the
Anglo-Saxon race. His last (ul captandum address
■was in opposition to assisted immigration, in which
he laid down the doctrine that, when a community
is prosperous, every class in it should share in that
prosperity. Did it ever strike this aspiring dema-
gogue that the prosperity of a country is increased
uy immigration, and, therefore, that he is only
endeavouring to obstruct the prosperity, of the
class he represents when he goes upon “ the stump”
to denounce the system referred to ? E. W.
O’S. talks of forming an Australasian party, based
upon democratic lines, the banner of which he
will unfurl at the next election in Sydney or its
suburbs: but when he does, it is to be hoped that
he will lay down its principles with more logic
and less fervid oratory than ho uses when de-
nouncing “ our iniquitous system of assisted im-
migration, which is a violation of our free-trade
policy and the laws of supply and demand,” etc.,
etc. This young man requires watching, or ho
may set the Parramatta on fire, and otherwise
play Gehenna with the great resources of N.S.W.
The Age omits no opportunity of endeav-
ouring to undermine Australian loyalty by
ridiculing the House of Lords. Even our gracious
Sovereign does not escape the sneers of this
Revolutionary journal. Hear it:-" The tem-
porary cast of the John Brown statue, which the
Queen lias erected on the lawn at Balmoral in
front of the royal apartments, is tho subject of
general dismission in artistic circles. Boehm, the
sculptor, admits that it is far better looking than
John Brown ever was, but says Her Majesty came
to the studio weekly to superintend the model-
ling, and insisted on one change or another, until
he thought ho was doing the Apollo Belvidere in
kilts.” Thus, because our Sovereign Lady idealised
this humble, haggis-worrying, red-headed fol-
lower, mentally planed down his high cheek bones,
flattened out a corrugation hero and took iu a
reef there, the organ of Australian Nihilism makes
a feeble attempt to be funny, callously disregard-
ing the pain it is inflicting on the loyal Antipo-
dean baronets, C.M.G.’s, and prominent citizens,
who, in defence of the Throne, would willingly
sacrifice all their poor relations left behind in the
old country. It is not delicate, it is not well-bred,
it is not even decent! Perish such stuff 1
As most people run after anything in
human shape that boars a title, we may as well say
that there are 90) baronets in the United Kingdom.
The or-!er hasn’t even a respectable origin, and
was created under base circumstances. In 1611
James I., wanting money and not knowing how to
get It, offered to confer tho new dignity on 300
gentlemen, on condition they contributed about
£1100 each to his exchequer. Eight years later,
baronets wore started in Ireland on the same
terms; and subsequently in Scotland on payment
of the required oawbees. And the Australian
baronetcy-grabbers are paying in hard cash for
their baubles. So there’s nothing heroic in
baronetcies. For the benefit of leading Sydney
tuft-hunters we may observe that a baronet is not
a peer or nobleman, and has no business to bo
called a “ lord.” He possesses the lowest possible
grade of hereditary title, and in precedence at
Court ho walks in about the one hundred and fifth
rank. A baronetage hy no means ensures the
opening of society s doors to its afflicted owner.
Even after he has boiled enough soap, sold enough
cheese, or accumulated enough sheep to walk
right into the order, a man can generally reckon
on about ten generations being necessary for his
heirs to rub off tho “shop,” and mix with the
blue blood of England, Though many baronets
are wealthy, others are pitiable specimens of
pauperism. The gentleman who bears the high-
sounding cognomen of Sir John Buckworth-
Hcrne has no residence, no income, “ no nothing,”
and his sin and heir is a day-labourer on a Canada
farm. Sir Henry" Dick is accountant in a country
bank. The baronetcies of Steele and Congreve
are awaiting claimants, the sons of each having
gone “Tichborning” years ago and not been
heard of since. The woman married by Sir Cape!
Fitzgerald was a love-chiid. and he never knew
her real name. It is improbable that this little
bar-sinister across the lady’s character would
cause much anxiety to the “noble” baronet, as
Sir Capel himself was not long ago trotted before
a London magistrate for annexing the jewelry of
a fair but frail Anonyma, whoso exclusive society
he had been enjoying during a whole week of
uninterrupted giddiness. Men of almost every
profession and branch of trade have been made
baronets, but seldom unless wealthy, A few men
are great, notwithstanding that they have been
made baronets.
Mr. J. W. Hamilton, one of earliest
pioneers of N. Z , and one of the proprietors of the
Lyttelton Times, died suddenly last month, at
his residence in Christchurch, in tho 58th year of
his ago. Mr. Hamilton arrived in N.Z. as long ago
as 1843, and with the exception of one short visit
to the mother country, he has lived in the colony"
ever since. Ho was Private Secretary for several
years to the first two Governors (Captain Fitzroy
and Sir George Grey), and in that capacity took an
active part in many of the stirring scenes and
official interviews with the old cannibal Maori
chiefs of that early period. He was the first white
man who travelled overland from the Bluff to
Dunedin, and from Dunedin to Port Lyttelton.
He crossed the great rivers, the Clutha, Mataura,
Waitangi, and others in the old Maori fashion on
bundles of calladdys, the light dry stalks of the
flax plant tied together, and forming rafts which
could not sink, but were extremely difficult to
nav igate in the dangerous currents of those swift-
liowing rivers. Mr. Hamilton occupied for several
years the post of R.M. at Wanganui, in the North
Island. He was afterwards Collector of Customs
at the Port of Lyttelton. For several years before
his death ho lived in Christchurch, having retired
from official life on a well-earned pension. He was
a good man, a true friend, open-handed and
generous, and a clover musician. His funeral
was attended by a largo concourse of citizens,
including the whole of the staff of the Lyttelton
Times Co,, and the members of the Christchurch
Cat hcdral choir,
A day or two ago, the dailies had a cable-
gram about the celebrated Belt v. Lawes libel
case, decided a year or two ago, which now bids
fair to bo re-opened, the defendant's application
for a new trial having been granted, provisionally
on Belt not being content to accept £500 damages;
and, seeing that the original verdict in his favour
was fur £500), the energetic sculptor has surprised
everyone hy accepting the compromise instead of
uphuldi g his case for the second time. The ran-
cour displayed towards Belt by the “high art”
party (of whom Lawes, in his letter to Vanity
Fair, was merely the mouthpiece) is pretty easily
accounted for. Knowing him to be their inferior
in education, and, for the matter of that, in art
training, they envy him the fame which a bold
natural talent has won for many of his efforts;
but, above all, they envy the business ability
which has enabled Belt to amass a fortune, and
placed him in the position ot patron to many of
his “cultured” rivals. Sir Frederick Leighton is
regarded as leader ot the clique that found the
sinews of war for the campaign carried on against
“ that common fellow, Belt,” and, certainly,
neither money nor influence was spared in their
efforts to kill the professional reputation of this
thorn in their artistic sides. Lawes, who figured
as defendant in the libel case, is the sou of Sir
John Bennett Lawes, th« well-known scientific
farmer, and was, in bis day, more celebrated as an
athlete than be ever will be as a sculptor. Twenty
years ago, J. B. Lawes was stroke oar of the Cam-
nriiigo “ eight,” winner of the Diamond and
Wingfield sculls, and the champion runner, either
at short or long distances, of the Universities.

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
From the tone of the American press, it
would appear Hanlan has decided upon a visit to
Australia. Young Teemer, who recently stated
he had no intention of tackling the Canadian, at
latest had changed his mind, and issued a decided
challenge to the champion. Hanlan expressed
much surprise, and said it was unfair to send forth
such a defiance In view ot the arrangements lately
made by Hanlan, which would prevent him
engaging in a match-race with any American
sculler for some months to come. He said, how-
ever, that he would make a match for £1000 a side,
to be rowed after he returned from Australia.
The Clipper stated that Hanlan would leave tor
’Frisco on November 14 or 15, accompanied by Lee,
remain in California (where he was to row Steven-
son) about three weeks, and start for Sydney
about December 10. He Intends making a tour of
the colonies, giving exhibitions on rowing
machines in theatres, halls, &c , and while in Aus-
tralia wifi be open to row any man for £10CO a side.
After his engagement la over, he will return home
vid England, arriving in America about August.
♦ * •
Hanlan has had a new boat built by Rud-
duck specially for his colonial trip. She Is called
“Old Friends,” and is fitted with the Campbell
slide, the socll of which is of metal, and, Instead of
babbit being used in the grooves, a metal or com-
bination of metals is introduced, which does away
ilargely with friction. Another new feature in the
irig of the boat is the moving of the rowlock-pin
■.ten inches, bringing it on a line with the sculler’s
iheel s, and allowing greater power at the finish of
the stroke. This will necessitate the use of longer
iscalls, and the champion thinks he will be able to
row faster than ever with the change of rig.
Rather cheering news to the sculler who may
have the happiness of meeting him here; for it
would be hard to gauge the amount of “ climatic
influence” necessary to bring the Canadian down
to the level of any of our oarsmen. Lee, who has
been pulling double sculls with the champion,
accompanies him to ’Frisco, but no mention is
made of his visiting the Antipodes. Should he do
so, a double scull race would be a big draw, for in
our opinion double sculling is the most showy
style of rowing done. Challenges, and rumours of
challenges, are the order of the day amongst the
second flight of Yankee oarsmen, and Wallace
Ross is matched against Conley for £200 aside, over
a three mile course. Rowing in England is stag-
nant, the only event amongst the professionals
being asculling handicap—by time—over a course
from Hermitage Wharf to New Crane, Shadwell.
W. Truman and G. Perkins started in the final
heat, which was won by the former. The finish
was so close that the judge declined to place them,
but Perkins said he did not think he had won, so
the prize was awarded to Truman. Perkins rather
put the amateurs to the blush by voluntarily
resigning the prize. Perish the thought that the
pair privately agreed to divide the plunder to save
further trouble!
♦ * ♦
Here’s a par. specially for the “ Army of
the Blue Ribbon.” Sullivan, the American
masher, has signed the pledge, and by so doing
hopes “ to preserve unimpaired for years to come
the wonderful physical powers of the greatest
man of his ‘ profession ’ that the century has pro-
duced.” The Sullivan combination must bo
raking in the dollars at a merry rate. About 4000
people of all classes attended a show at Alleghany
fPa ), on October 19, when Sullivan and Slade made
a splendid exhibition. The Maori set-to in an
entirely different style to when he was under bis
eheap engagement to Mace. The Gipsy must
■“ whip the eat ” at being out of such a big draw.
For real brutality, the old-time British prize fight
eould not hold a candle to some of the so-called
“ glove contests ” now so common in the States,
and about which some of the better class of
American journals are beginning to call out. In
a recent hard glove tight m ’Frisco, between two
roughs named Downie and Barry, the first and
second rounds were so tamo that the crowd became
Indignant, yelling, “Sham ! fixed ! humbug 1” and
a host of other noises. Tho third round showed
hard, quick blows, and close fighting, Barry’s
long reach making up for Downie’s finer condition
and better skill. The fight in this round became
desperate, indeed brutal. All attempt at line
defence or straight hitting was thrown aside ; the
men locked their loft arms and punched each
other with the right ; tho order of the referee to
“ break ” was unheeded, and finally Downie went
down, and Barry hit him before he recovered his
feet. “Foul” was claimed by his seconds and
howled by the mob, but unheeded by the referee.
For the next three rounds both men had to be
held up, pushed and nursed into each other’s arms,
where they vainly tried to hit each other. In the
sixth round both wore exhausted, and fell, strug-
gling like two bulldogs on the floor, and the referee
gave a loul against Downie. For wh.t, no one
could tell. Then pandemonium broke loose, and
free fights were as thick as blackberries, con-
tinuing until the lights were put out. What a
farce for tho police to stop a scientific set-to, such
as the recent Sullivan-Mitchell affair, and allow a
human dog-tight such as tho above to be carried
out to the bitter end.
• • •
And talking of glove fights, Melbourne
had rather a lively set-to the other evening,
between Mick Nathan and Allbrook. Tho affair
came out of a row on the racecourse on Cup Day,
but the pair managed to bottle their wrath till the
22nd December, when they settled their little
difference and made a few dollars at one and the
same time, at Newton and Nathan’s Hall, Bourke-
street, which, by the way, the talented pair
have disposed of to “a party of the name ot
Parkes,” lately hailing from Temora, the town of
lies and nuggets. Allbrook stands 5ft. 8in., and
weighted to Nathan’s 9st. 61b. Small gloves
were used, and the police interfered after eight
punishing rounds had been gone through in
29mln. Nathan was very confident he could put
tho big 'un through, but he found ont to his cost,
as many a good man has done before him, that it
takes a lot of fighting to bring a two-stone heavier
man down to his weight.

There is trouble up Rockhampton way
over some of the prizes given at tho recent
Gymnasium sports. One swain, a successful
pedestrian, has just declined with thanks a prize
watch, valued at £6, but which he thinks isn’t
worth half the money. We have heard something
very much like this before, but it happened very
much nearer home than Rockhampton. And this
item ot Bananaland sport reminds us that a
thousand pounds sweep was successfully floated
at Winton, a town uot thought of four years ago;
although a similar effort fell through in Rock-
hampton. Winton is a hotbed for sport, from the
genial Major downwards.
The Yankee sawdust-worriers are again i
trying to work up the agony. C. A. Harriman.
who some months since walked 100 miles without
leaving the track, at Truck ee, California, has now
walked 122 miles in North Bloomfield, Cal., under
the same conditions, covering the distance in 25
hours 58 minutes. Of course we shall get a letter
from Williams, stating that he has done better
than this in Australia. But don’t, old man! we
will take the will for the deed. George Hazel has
returned to New York, and Charles Rowell is also
there by this time ; so Alderman Patrick Fitz-
gerald has issuf d the customary challenge, and our
American friends are therefore likely to be af-
flicted with another six days' “cruelty show.”
Whether it will be a profitable venture or not it is
impossible to state; but the game is played out in
England, and, it is to be hoped, in Australia.
Edwards is still on the war path in New Zealand,
and articles have been signed at Christchurch for
a six days’ walking match, in which he is to walk
against Henry Huestep, Arthur Hendry, and
.Tames Hendry. The match is for £100 a side at
New Year. Our own Daniel O’Leary is beginning
to be looked upon in the States as rather a leary
one, judging from a par. in a Yankee exchange.
It says:—“ Daniel O’Leary, the inveterate walker,
is again amongst us, and stirring things up gene-
rally. Next Monday morning, at the Mechanics’
Pavilion, the first of O’Leary’s ventures will
begin. The report is that he will match himself
and somo one else to walk and run some one else
and another, heel-and-toe and go-as-you-please
against gc-as-you-please and heel-and-toe. We
don’t like this quartette contest, and have no love
for matches made against ‘ unknowns.’ The
whole thing savours of sham, and an attempt to
work up interest by fictions published in easily
gulled papers.”

Both American and English peds. have
been breaking records. In America, Myers has
succeeded in upsetting a very old record, which
probably owes its existence to the fact of no first-
class pedestrian having attempted the feat of
beating it. This celebrated amateur athlete, at a
meeting held at the Polo Grounds, for the benefit
ot Jack Goulding. of the American A.C., and 41f
badger, of the Manhattan A.C., in October, ran
four separate quarter miles in 3rain. 51 4-5sec.,
thus beating the record achieved by C. Westhall
thirty years ago, The first quarter was run in
51 2-3sec.; thirteen minutes after he ran the second
quarter in55sec.; fourteen minutes later he ran
the third quarter in 52 3-5 sec.; and. after another
rest of fourteen minutes, he finished the fourth
and last quarter in 52 4-5 sec. Westhall’s time was
3rain. 52sec. On May, 17,1853, Westhall ran the
distance, and jumped eight hurdles, at Garratt-
lanc. Wandsworth, for a bet of £10, in 3min. 57sec.
In England, W. G. George recently r n ten miles
in 52min. 53sec.. which supersedes all amateur
records for that distance. He is credited with
doing the distance in less than 51min. in a private
trial, which beats “ Deerfoot’s ” record of 51min.
26seo. “ Doerfoot’a” record may be all right; but
as Martin, his manager, held the watch, it is not
li kely he got th« worst, of It. George runs with
an enormous stride, and covers something like
9 feet every step. On fvov. 1. over 3000 spectators
witness!dthe wrestling match, at’Frisco, between
Muldoon and Whistler. Muldoon is much tho
bigger man of tho two, and loosed a giant along-
side his adversary. Muldoon gained first fall,
Whistler tho second; and when ton minutes had
elapsed of the third bout, Muldoon threw his
opponent souse on his shoulder with sufficient
force to dislocate his shoulder. Muldoon claimed
the match, and as Whistler was unable to “how at
the call of time, we think ho fairly earned it; but
the referee could not see it in that light, and pro-
claimed a draw. On November 10, at Lynn, tT.- 1 .,
Charles O. Brood (one of the right breed evidently)
fairly put up from the shoulder to arm’s length
above bis head a fifty pound dumb-bell sixty times
in succession with tho right hand alone—a square
push-up each time, without any jumping. G. M.
Robinson, of ’Frisco, had the previous best to hij
credit—58 times in succession. Robinson is tho
amateur who is credited with getting all the b»st
ot a set-to with Slade, the Maori. Donald Dinnle,
the renowned athlete, arrived at Auckland by the
’Frisco mail boat, and at latest was at Dunedin.
Donald, before leaving the States, had a little
court trouble with a theatrical manager. At
Mott Haven, U.S., W. M, Ford, an amateur, covered
10ft. 5><j in. in a standing jump, and made a record
beating J. J, Tickle's previous best of 10ft. 5in.,
made at Manchester (England) on September 2,
1871.
♦ ♦ ♦
Melbourne held its annual regatta on the
22nd December, and taking Into consideration the
entries in the various eight-oar races, it is not to
be wondered at that Sydney cannot raise a crew
to compete with the Cabbage Gardeners, who are
likely to rake in all the intercolonial races for
somo time to come. No less than seven crews
started for the maiden eights, three for senior
eights, and eight for the maiden fours; while in
Sydney we cannot raise an eight-oar race
throughout tho year without the two crews start
from the same shed, and such a thing as raising a
third eight is out of the question. Shortly alter
tho last intercolonial we suggested tho Rowing
Association shonld pick a heavy crow and lick
them into shape, but they appear to have gone to
sleep, and we suppose will wake up, as per usual,
a few weeks before the race and pick eight men,
or rather, a couple of men and a half-dozen nine-
stoners to row for us, and be beaten as a matter
of course. Tho Melbourne crew, H. S. Franklin,
E. Lethbridge, W. Burnip, D. A liken (stroke),
won the Junior Fours. The Grand Challenge Cup
fell to T. W. Thompson, W. Kelly, T. Graham,
W. W. Senior (stroke), tho Victorian crew; A. W.
Pities won tpe Challenge Sculls from Beale, the
present holder, and Wood; J. Mitchell won the
Junior Sculls; and the Melbourne eight, A, R.
Tunbridge, H. P. Douglas, W. Burnip, W. J.
Leverett, F. AnkerfiOh, F. G. Hughes, W. H. f

On October 11, George M. Hendee bicycled
a mile in 3min. GOsec., and made an American
record. Hendee also holds the States record for
the following distances : Three miles, Strain.
sec; four miles, 12rain. 30scc.: five miles, 15min.
26%sec. John 8. Prince has also been doing some
good wheel work in the States. On November 3
he won the 72 hours’ professional race, at Chicago,
with a score of 889 miles. The English professional
bicyclists recently gave tho amateurs a pretty
rough shot. The London National Cyclists Uulon
proposed to take the affairs of the professionals
In hand, with the view of amongst other things
putting a stop to unfair riding, but the pros,
declined with thanks, as they considered the
amateurs stood far more in need of such supe--
vision themselves ! The swimming world is all
agog in England. Willie Beckwith and James
Finney were matched to swim three races of one,
two, and five miles respectively, on December 17,
for £100 a side each contest, or £600 in all—by far
tho largest amount ever competed for in a swim-
ming race. The much-talked-of match between
Misses Sargcman wnd Johnson, over a mile course,
for £200 and the “ Ladies’ Championship.” resulted
in a win for Miss Johnson, who isonly 15U years of
ago, by 52 yards In 35min. 344sec. Both kept to
the side stroke throughout. A match is on the
lapis between tho winner and Agnes Beckwith.
Cairns, who held the amateur swimming cham-
pionship, at 220 yards, is a Liverpool bath attend-
ant, and was smuggled into London as an amateur,
but the swindle oozed out, and Cairns was dis-
qualified. As a consequence, Mr. Blew-Jones
becomes amateur champion at 220 yards, and to
him will also belong the credit of the best re-
corded time at the distance, viz., 3min.
£400 have been subscribed in England for the
widow of Captain Webb, and the committee have
sensibly decided that “ it is better to give bread to
the living than stone to the de«d.” So no portion
ot it will go lor a monument. Professor Tyndall
assigns Webb’s failure to failing health, and is of
opinion that the swimming of the Niagara rapids
is not an Impossibility.

Some of the English papers are gushing
over young Martin, tho lad of 15 who rode
Don Juan to victory in the Cesarewiteh. Ac-
cording to one paper, Marlin is a guileless young-
ster, who still goes to school, and thought more of
a penknife given to him by his uncle than the
thousand pounds given by Mr. Lambert, the
owner of the horse. Considering Martin would
handle the whole ot the penknife, and very little
of the thou., this seems only natural. He ought
now to hamstring a tew horses with bis little pen-
knife, and confess to the freak; and some of the
weeklies would make him out a veritable George
W ashington. When James Smith won the Cesare-
witeh, in 1876, with Rosemary. Mr. Smith’s total
winnings alone approached £70,000; but it is stated
the Don Juan party won more hard cash than has
been “trousered" over one race for the last 15
years. The Liverpool (Eng.) Autumn Cup resulted
in a win for Boswell, the unlucky Tonans second,
and Springbok third. Boswell’s win created more
chagrin than Is usually the case when an outsider
wins. Ho started tirst favourite, but it was with a
hop, skip, and jump that he gained that position.
Twenty-four hours before the race he was practi-
cally an outsider, a horse that everyone was afraid
to touch until those more immediately connected
With him gave them a lead. With regard to Tonans,
and Mr. Long’s alleged big purchase at the Middle
Park sale, the World says that, “after suddenly
removing his horses in training: f rom Tom Brown’s
stable, at Newmarket, and placing them In charge
of Lord Ellesmere's trainer, Mr. Long disposed of
his interest in tho lease of Tonans, to a bookmaker
cannected with Brown’s stable. It is now whis-
pered that. Instead of purchasing so extensively
of mares and foals at the late Middle Park sale,
for exportation to N.S.W., Mr- Long performed
tho part of nmims curicc, by buying In the greater
portion of those that were knocked down to him I
Suspicion thereof arose at the time, which was
strengthened, if not confirmed, when it transpired
that the solitary bid of five hundred guineas for
Scottish Chief was on behalf of Mr. W. Blcnkiron.
At any rate, it is now hinted that Mr. Lena's re-
puted purchases are not unlikely to be bi ought to
the hammer again shortly,

Cnp, on the strength of a trial at South Creek,
when ho beat Eva and others; and started at 3 to
1, tho same price Morpeth, and Sloth
was much fancied alter his Campbelltown win. A
grand race ensued between Sloth and Corlolanus
up the straight, and many thought the latter had
won, until Mr. Waliord gave his decision in f avour
of Sloth. Sardonyx ran a good horse, and would
without doubt have made a better bid for first
place had not the buckle come off his girth when
some thirty yards from home. Tho Glencoe
people showed their judgment in saving Glei.coo
for the A.J.C. Handicap, which he won by half a
length from Ascot.

Tho S.A.J.C. have issued a programme
for May 10.15, and 17. Tho AdelaidoCup isa stake
of £25<i0, of which £2000 goes to tho first horse, £3l0
to the second, r.nd £200 to the third. The entrance
foe will be 5 sovs.; acceptances 10 sovs., final pay-
ment. All these amounts to go to theclub; hut if
there should be any surplus over the £2500, it will
be divided between the second and third horses.
Tho distance is altered to 1 >6 mile and a furlong.
And now for a lot of miscellaneous items.
£8929 were run through the totalisator at the
Dunedin (N.Z.) Spring meeting. In England, the
big hi Uard tournament at the Aquarium resulted
in a win for W. J. Peall, T. Taylor runner up.
After Peall’s victory Mitchell offered to concede
him 750 In 5000, but the offer was declined. In
America, the ocean yacht race for £200, between
the Grade and Fanny, was won by the latter. She
is 72 feet overall. 66 feet on water-line, 23 feet 9
inches beam, 0 feet 9 inches depth of hold, and
draws 5 feet of water. Ike has gone to Maitland.
Klttleman, the American sprinter, is credited with
running 100 yards at Oregon, U.S, in 9% seconds.
Every sprinter does this at soae period or other
of his life. The owner of an open boat has
written us that it was not on account of the prize
not being a money one that the boats refused to
start at Manly regatta, but because the com-
mittee had refused to start the race from Farm
Cove on a general requisition from the boat
owners. The founder of the Thames Haro and
Hounds has Mt upon the idea of handicapping by
weight. M. Wilson is top weight with 301b., which
ought to prove a steadier over a long run. Says
“ Pendragon”—“ Now if Trickcttand Laycock had
offered to row double sculls against Hanlan there
would be something injit. Rough this. London
Bell’s Life says Laycock has taken Deebie’s
Hotel, Shark Island, Sydney! Bros. Dywer the
American turfmen, owners of tho crack three-
year-old Miss Woodford, won, during 188
£20,000, and their eight years’ turf experience haB
brought them in some £80,000. The New Zealano
papers recently stated that two Musket fillies were
purchased lor export to England, but it takes
some of the gilt off the gingerbread when wo now
hear they are intended for carriage horses. In
England, Goggles is being schooled for hurdle
racing. In America, the trotter H. B. Winshlp
and running mate, Hiram Brace, covered a mile in
2.10%, and beat the record of 2.11 made by Yellow
Dock and mate.

The simple-minded portionof the sporting
public, who are never at a loss to impute a motive
or find a reason when things go slightly against
their gx-ain, have now discovered that several of
the members of the projected Australian Eleven,
engaged on the N.S. Wales side in tho Intercolonial
match, threw away their wickets In the second
innings, so as not to interfere with the match to
commence on New Year’s Day. And while on the
cricket racket, we would ask what has become of
the bowling and fielding powers for which Aus-
tralian elevens have been so celebrated ? Judged
by recent performances, the fourth team will be
sadly deficient in these important departments of
tho game. The Demon Bowler will not accom*
pany the English eleven on the war-path. It is
understood that he Is at present engaged in the
exhilarating pastime of overianding jumbucks.

OUR PAPER-WEIGHTS,
Whenever we go out to take a drinK,
Which we do pretty frequently, we think,
We load our papers down, and make them fast
To stand against the fury of the blast
Which thro’ the window blows. By papers most
Wo mean the things that come to us by post—
Poems, and stories: though, sirs, wc may state,
The stones often stay by their own weight.
But should the poems thro’ the window fly,
Some man might pick them up, and read, and die.
The kind of poems these the Alfred prints,
And we do not. We merely state as hints
The paper-weights we use for these —an axe;
A ten-inch bowie-knife, that sticks like wax;
A little tomahawk; a club with spikes—
Each interviewer can have which he likes:
A shot-gun, and a specimen of quartz,
And other rocks of various weights and sorts.
And so we wait, thus armoured and equipped,
Each bard to call round for his manuscript.
We rcav remark, just here, the printer prints
These little facts but in the way of hints.
The next important matter requiring a
a scientifically accurate description Is ‘‘God’s
grace.” In this ago wo are no sooner over one
difficulty than we are on to another, and the
hands of science are always kept full, showing us
exactly what each thing is. The Kev. Fr.
M'Kenna, of Fitzroy (Vic.), went a week or so ago
among a mixed company of prize-givers, and
announced that he could always tell children who
had been educated denominationally from those
brought up In the secular system merely by
looking at their faces. In the faces of the former
he at ouce sees “ God's grace,” while in the faces
of the latter there isn't a drop of it. We say
‘ a drop" of it. but are not sure whether it Is
liquid or solid, whether It sticks on to a particular
feature, dribbles down any p«rtleuiar channel, or
blends Itself with the whole configuration. That’s
where we require scientific accuracy. That it la
beautifying should he. In the meantime, a
natural enough assumption. But even out of this
general statement a scandalous difficulty arises.
Surely If denomlnatlonallsm beautifies the
featurfsof children, the denominational lenders,
who have been all their lives at it, must have
sweet, sweet countenances. Now, it is a plain
matter of faet that the denominational leaders in
Victoria possess, as a body, countenances that the
average leading families would decline indignantly
to accept as sitting parts. How does “ God’sgrace ’
act on the lace ?

“Dear Sir,—Of the sample of George Goulet’s

terms too highly. Its qualities are certainly of a
very high oi dcr. It possesses a charming bouquet,
fruity and pronounced. It is essentially a dry

It is full, crisp, end clean on the palate ; and
whilst it exhtlirates, It unquestionably aids diges-

SUNDRY SHOWS.
Theatbe Royal—“Christmas Pantomime .. P.8.
Opkba House—“The Sunny South’ Id-
Academy of Music-"Zulu War” lb -
There are, perhaps, few things more
picturesque than the dress-circle of a crowded
theatre on pantomime night—a circle replefe
with dimples, and full of the sounds of old
men’s chuckles and of children’s laughter.
And such a forest of little arms; such
a storm of little voices, now crying at the giant,
now crowing at the clown. To us there is more
treasure in seeing these sash-hedight urchins, and
hearing their honest little criticisms than in a world
of Muntz nmtal, a myriad of spangles, or a ton ot
tinsel. We took a lady that night, to whom we
were not married. We say it boldly. She was
just turned of six, and
“ Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax.
Her cheeks like the dawn of day ;
and one of the principal charms about her was her
fearless outspokenness. We—as doubtless our
readers will have noticed—crawl and grovel occa-
sionally to the profession. We, therefore, whis-
pered her in the circle to be discreet in her
remarks—but she wouldn’t. We even bribed her
with one of Defries’s ices—Hamlet now provides
ices, and beauties, too, in the vestibule of the
Royal—to be silent; but she wouldn’t. She said
dreadful things about the new clown. Will Simp-
son ; and detecting Mussy conducting the per-
formance on the O.P. side, crowed at him fran-
tically under the impression that he was the
harlequin. She likewise (to our confusion) called
Mr. George Reid “dada,” and an hon. Minister
as “ unkel;” conplcting our confusion by address-
ing the Ambitious Albert(a courtly gentleman.who
sells things gracefully by auction) as “ Gurroo”
—the name, it seems, she has given to a person
whom her parents have subsidised to wheel her
about in a time-payment perambulator. Although
we found our criticism upon—we quote the
classic George—“The grand comic Christmas
pantomime. Jack and the Beanstalk, and See-saw
Margery Daw, or Harlequin Man in the Moon, the
Love Birds of Fairyland and the Giant of Tel-el
Kebir ” the remarks of the little fairy we have
mentioned, we wish it to be distinctly understood
that, though we are conscientious so far as it goes,
our attention was somewhat distracted from the
performance at times ty the frantic efforts a pair
of dimpled knees continually made to clamber
over the dress circle tier, and fall crashing into
the stalls. We say “stalls” advisedly, because
George has abolished the pit. As Clive Newcome
had “a soul above buttons,” so Mr. Musgrove has,
it seems, a spirit superior to the pit. You can’t
pass in now under “two bob.” On the strength
ot this, the pit habitude are pensive; and it is
rumoured that when Mr. Musgrove travels home,
after the show, to the Oxford, he wears a
block-tin jersey, for the buckling on of which the
Merry Moss receives an extra stipend.
• * •
And now for the acting. The noble book
(from the title-page of which George modestly
withholds his name!) is elsewhere spoken of; an 1
we don’t think, so far as we can remember, that
we have ever-since we noticed Carlyle’s History
ot the French Revolution”—lavished more marma-
lade upon any modern production. Of the acting,
well, to tell the truth, there is not very much
acting; but there are plenty of legs, and a very
vast quantity, indeed, of feet. We have seen more
feet on a stage at one time; but we have never
seen so much. It is hardly any figure of speech to
state that when three ladies stood together in the
“first position” there was no room for anybody
else on either side nearer than the scene-dock.
The Giant—who had a big candlestick, and every-
thing else of a Brobdignagian character—was a
perfect Cinderella to some of the ladies of the
ballet. Represented by Mr. Webbe, the Giant was
but a feeble monster. He hardly inspired any
terror, and his voice, when roaring for a sheep
or two, was decidedly more suggestive of a weak
chest than of a descendant of, say, Blunderbore.
♦ * *
Miss Nellie Stewart was very lively as
Jack, and worked—if we may be allowed the ex-
pression—like a little demon. We like Miss Nellie
in pantomime very much; that is probably partly
because we like to hear her sing within her range,
and partly because you see more of her in panto-
mime than you do in opera bouffe. And you
cannot—we take our cue from the mashers for
this-see too much at any time of Miss Nellie
Stewart. We wish, however, that Miss Nellie had
not introduced the lime-light song her sister used
to sing in “ Sindbad.” Miss Liddiard looked pretty
as Margery, and, like Miss Stewart (we mean Miss
Nellie Stewart!), had a plethora of dresses. But
Miss Liddiard has a great deal to learn; and she
hs»s especially to learn that it does not simply
suffice to look lovely, and to be gorgeous in satin
and stage bullion, in order to score a success in a
burlesque opening. What Miss Liddiard chiefly
lacks, we consider, is a conception ot her part.
We have known many ladies in a similar predica-
ment, and we cannot—though we are even now
straining ourselves—recall to our recollection a
single one of these artistes who has been
more than a furious success under the same
trifling disabilities. Mr. Harry Taylor was
dr'dl as Jack’s Mother ; and Mr. Simpson
was comparatively droll as Livliboi in the opening
and later on as the Clown in the Pantomime. Both
these gentlemen are clever to some extent, and we
are glad they have travelled some 16,000 miles to
sec us. It would have required some hesitation
on our parts before we would have travelled that
distance to enjoy even their histrionic abilities.
But, then, we don’t like travelling. It disturbs
the children who sleep in the hair trunk. The
prettiest of all the pretty pictures was, perhaps,
Minnie Hope. She enacted the part of the “ Man
in the Moon,” but she didn’t loos a bit like a man;
and (let us whisper this) we don’t think she wanted
to. Nothing in pearl silk tights and a twelve-inch
tunic could look like a man. And how was the
crowd collared—we mean, how was the stand up
collared crowd collared ? It drivelled from start
to finish. Binoculars were blurred, black ties
disordered, and upon a diamond-bedecked shirt-
front stood many a salted tear.
• •
There were a lot more in it, sans doute
(a new brand of tobacco, Alfred): and there was
some superior scenery by Mr. Hennings. And
there was a good deal of singing, also, of a some-
what feeble description, andsome marching which
bordered on the mournful.

Anyhow, let us say this, and it will draw

We don’t mind letting you into a gentle
secret. We (that reminds us) are always doing
something rash; and once more we repeat—which
is verse—the dating feat. Well, we like hors«
opera. That naturally means the circus. St.
Leon’s. It is named after the proprietor, who is
an exceedingly dapper little gentleman, with bril-
liant studs of the purest water; and tho’—this is
droll, if you consider it well—he has only the ordi-
nary number of eyes, he has an eye on everything
Th re are also Mr. Jones, the ring-master; acamel;
Qus St. Leon; a colt with a donkey’s head, the
whole about the size of a Civil servant’s lunch;
Mr. Taylor, a juggler who does everything that
can be done with a plate, except either sit down
on it or eat off it: a boa constrictor (too full of
beef to be entertaining (though, it is whispered, in
its softer moments it is musical): Mr. ;Maudesley,
the fascinating advance-agent; 19 horses; Mr. W.
St. Leon: a dromedary; “ thecourt'e^Mas treasurer,
Mr. Morgan”: Mr. West; Signor Velotti; a lot
more; Joe O’Brien; a dromedary: a brass band,
ot an eccentric, and, consequently, interesting
nature; and a camel.
• • •
We were really very much interested in
the camel, esp -cially about his lower Up, which
hung down very low, indeed—evidently having
been depressed by a long course of very long I
beers. On entering the tent, we were fortunate
enough to meet the proprietor of the show, and
he told us a lot about camels that surprised us.
“ How many camels do you possess at the present
time, Mr. St. Leon?” we said. “ Only two now, ’
he replied, weeping bitterly. “ Did they die ?” we
enquired, greatly moved. “ No,” said he with a
sob, “ they deserted me.” “ But couldn't you
recapture them ?” we enquired, with much feeling.
“No,” murmured Mr. St. L. in great anguish ;
“itis now impossible. Why (pockethandkerchief),
whenever I, in my travels, come across one of
those camels, I always have to take off my hat,
and” (in a lower tone) “dare not, be bad friends
with any of them.” “Are they, then, so fierce?”
we enquired. “ Oh no,” said he in a hoarse (no
joke intended) whisper, dragging us in his emotion
rather uncomfortably near to the cage of the
tiger, who, thank heaven, was wrapped in
slumber, “ they are quite domesticated.” “ Well,
then, don’t you take me?” he asked, wonderingfy.
“No.” “Then,” he muttered in great anguish,
“ listen. Fifteen camels and two dromedaries have
left me, basely and wilfully in this colony. They
had the best of board; their dinner-beer, and as
much as twenty-four rainbow posters each per
diem, not to mention sawdust and” (he dropped a
tear at this juncture) ‘‘spangles d discretion. In
addition to this, they were taken by persons of
strict moral principles to all rational and instruc-
tive amusements, and three-and-six a week
for their washing was ” (in deep anguish) never
grudged by me. And as for tracts, the WAR CRY,
dates (when in season) the Evening News alter
the company had read it .” At this point the
esteemed proprietor of the circus broke down
completely.
• t •
The programme was a short one; but
there can be no doubt whatever that the St. Leon
boys are at the top of the tree in their profession.
To quote Mr. Sleary (who will live lor ever in
‘■Hard Times” —and all times, for the matter of
that!), they never ‘‘miss the tip,” and are acro-
bats, ring-bosses, and clowns, by turns. Gus. tells
us that he was offered £35 a week to go to America
with Cooper and Bailey—the exact sum that
Guglielmo gets for singing. We believe this, too ;
for Gus.. a tiger, and a horse would be a circus all
by themselves.
♦ ♦ ♦
You know where the show is, of course.
Then walk up while there is yet time. And if
this be considered an extra inducement, allow us
to tell you that there is a hotel right opposite, and
ice-cream (with a horn) in the immediate vicinity.

If anyoneisgoing to get a show this week,
it is Zulu Thompson. We have a certain sym-
pathy with Zulu, because we once lectured our-
selves. We remember the audience well. It
consisted of our aunt and a policeman. After the
lecture our aunt left; but we stayed. So did the
policeman, until we went away together. There
is a moral in this. [Hard to see ! —Bn. B.]
* * *
Mr. Thompson’s pictures are very fine; a
glimpse of those by Gordon being—let us bo
original or nothing—alone worth the price of
admission. But what is more gorgeous than either
the gifts or the pictures is the lecturer. He is a
study in black and gold—an effect in white and
diamonds. And bis periods ! How were they
balanced I You have seen the man at the
circus who balances the basin. Well, that
man is pretty clover on the balance with
a ewer; but nothing to what Bill is on the suspen-
sion racket with his sentences. He was always an
orator, but now ho is a flowing orator. His voice
rises and falls like the bosom of some Lalla Rookh-
ish houri. There is rhythm in his every syllable-
music in every inflexion of his sonorous voice.
When he dwells upon the fearful losses of the
British at Isandula, he keeps his hearers in a
silence born of a spell; when he dilates upon the
victories achieved by the Queen’s troops, storms
of cheering ring through the auditorium. We
wanted to say all this of the Rev. Charles Clark
and of Archibald Forbes once, but wo couldn’t
manage it. This was either because we could not
then write as glibly as we do now, or because the
fact dawned upon us during the discourses of these
gentlemen that our little butter-cooler wasn’t
visible to the naked—no, wo mean, the spectacled
gaze. However, ....
• •
The giving away of the presents was of
natural interest to us—though we could hardly
help colouring slightly when our number conjured
towards us a music-stool, a meat safe, two cruets,
a butter-trap, a wine cooler, and a cat-kennel; but
when these articles were supplemented by a Jew’s
harp, a biscuit-box, two opera-glasses, and a flute,
we don’t mind telling you that we felt just the
least bit embarrassed. In a whisper, we may
tell you that the only tinny we didn’t win was the
suite of furniture. An old lady of several cen-
turies got this, and somewhat delayed the pro-
ceedings through having to be helped down from
the gallery, in commas, by the whole of her
family—some nine in number. The ancient dame
was much applauded—and the more especially
when it transpired that she was arguing with the
talented lecturer about the payment of the van,
stating that she had paid her shilling, and did not
belong to a daily paper. There was a capital
house, and everything was lovely, including Mrs.
Zulu T., who was gracefully standing at the stalls
door—on the watch, we suppose, for the special
correspondent of the Cooma paper.
* * « *
We were glad to see it—glad, because we
love good music: are soft on the subject of Verdi;
and have always b«en (metaphorically) fft the feet
of Mr. and Mrs. Turner—a splendid house. The
wealth and aristocracy of Sydney were gathered
there-and we don’t mind telling you that the
former was represented by a collection of
“ponums” which could hardly be imagined out of
the Pentateuch. At times it is—though a brilliant
sight, possessing, as it does, a peculiar Oriental
colouring—somewhat embarrassing tor the critic
(however popular) to face even bejewelled
members of the Seven Tribes. It strikes us, now
we think of it, the more bejewelled they are the
more embarrassing it is to face them. We once—
before we built all round our block—had occasion
to go to the theatre at the command of an editor
whose confidence in us was such that he would
drive after us in a chaise-cart, and watch us inside.
This was, wo think, in Tamatave. By the way—
a chance —
We could not tell you, as we live,
If it’s Tamatane or Tamative.
(We could not say our soul to save
Whether Tamative or Tamatave) ;
The question now arises, if
It is not re«lly Tamatif—
Alt ho’—a happy thought, by Jove !—
It might be— qui salt— Tamatore.
Indeed—by Jove !—as we're alive—
Out there they may say Tamative—
But this, as everybody knows,
Has naught to do with “ Sundry Shows.”
• • •
It is “Maritana” that concerns us at the
present juncture. “ Maritana”—we believe we
give this to the world for the first time—” Mari-
tana” was composed by Mr. Vincent Wallace—(no
relation to Sandy “of that ilk;” fancy Sandy com-
posing an opera I),—a talented musician who, if we
are to believe the London papers, left his
affairs matrimonial in a complicated con-
dition. The libretto of “ Maritana ” was
written by a gentleman who alwajs made a point
of wearing a collar—we have all our little eccen-
tricities,—and it (we mean the book, not
the collar) was possibly suggested by a
play composed by Victor Hugo, Esq., who
is said to be a Frenchman. Of the interpreters
(with an exception or two) of this opera at the
Gaiety, we can speak in no other terms than those
of unqualified praise. After the surfeit of bogus
singing to which we have been treated, it is as
refreshing as sherbet (what is sherbet?) cooled
with snow, to listen to Annls Montague,
who is a perfect artist. (About the squarest
period wo have written since we sang
melodiously about a patent medicine.) And
Charley ! His voice, the night we saw him,
was a dream—a substantial one. But his Don
Ctesar is a by-word—we might almost say a pro-
verb: and there’s a musical pun to be drawn out
of this: and we’d draw it out if it were not New
Year’s Day, and our drag were not waiting outside
to take us to the races.
“ * * *
The Don Jose of Verdi was, as may be
imagined, something to be talked about, and he
was in such splendid voice that the people over
the way were seated upon the housetops and the
gahles, drinking in the melody, and —probably
beer as w<dl. Gordon—who is gorgeous as to
costume now, and extravagant in hair-oil—looked
pretty as the King of Spain, and sang with much
effect; but, perhaps (as we are in a hurry) the
less said about his acting the better. Miss E.
Sherwin was not, in our opinion, Sherwin
to advantage as liazarlllo, being apparently a
complete novice at acting. But a pleasing
novelty was invested in her i epresentation
of the “boy,” from the fact that her voice is a
pure soprano. (Our little satire.) All the other
people were all right, though we could have
wished that the soldiers in the prison-soene had
presented an appearance of a little more proba-
bility. Leon Caron conducted with consummate
art, and D’Arcy Read staged the piece capitally,
and was always to the fore with the props.
* ♦ *
Next opera, “Lucia,” which Verdi has
been studying for a fortnight with a wrinkled
brow.
* * * *
You shall have it now. A fall of snow-
shoes —we mean, of snow-shows —we hardly know
what we mean; but it is Christmas time, or New
Year’s time, or the time when people drink colonial
wine and eat almonds and raisins. Wo have
drunk colonial wine, and we have also eaten
almonds and raisins And, we do not feel
well. We are husky with the almonds and
bilious with the raisins, and the vintage of the
country has made salad of our inside. And this is
not pleasant. No vintage can be considered
pleasant which makes salad of one’s inside. Salad
in its proper sphere is a very pleasant thing; but
the moment you associate on second thoughts,
though, the topic, though essentially Christmassy,
is unpleasant. To change it, then, you shall hear
about Scantlebury in Brisbane; and you will be
sorry when you do hear that he did not, with his
opera bouffes, break up Chiariani’s circus. And
this, notwithstanding that Prank Towers played
Deadeye in“Pinafore,” having—poor old Prank!
—nothing to boast of in Rockhampton. Jack,
if we are to believe what wo hear (which
we don’t—of course, we never do !) put up
“Maritana,” with a complete chorus of three
hundred—or something; and the “Pirates,” with
the same number of auxiliaries. But as each
young lady spread herself out as muoh as possible,
the thing went oil remarkably well —one of the
ladies’ feetjeomman'ding, in each Instance, an im-
perative encore. Lambert is the big favourite up
there; and now all of them —Leaf, Harding, and
Templeton—are playing in Pantomime. And what
next? A good deal. A delicious little bit of satire
by “ Carados,” first. Here it is:—“ During a chat
with Conquest, I asked, ‘ Have you road any of
Gaboriau’s novels?’ He answered, ‘Yes, all of
em.’ * Ah, I thought so,’ I remarked, as I left him
to return to my seat.” The only explanation of
this, that we know, is that Conquest is, like an illus-
trious manager wo know, a dramatic author, And,
perhaps, you will be surprised to hear that “ Ours,’
in which Mr. Superintendent James was so great
ns “the Sarglnt,” has been revived at Toole’s
Theatre; and in reference to the reception of “ The
Sailor and His Lass,” at “ Old Drury,” by the press-
men of London, Robert Buchanan says he knows a
critic who “ holds a hat in one hand and a bludgeon
in the other.” What, it seems, has troubled the
author of “The White Rose and Red” most,
is the bludgeon. You shall be told, too, if you
are very very good (an idea dawns upon us that
we have used this expression before), that Mr.
Charles Sugden is playing, with great success, a
part in G. W. Godfrey’s adaptation of Edmund
y ates’s “ Broken to Harness” (“ The Millionaire”)
at the London Court. Charles, it will be remem-
bered, was the gay youth, who, when acting at the
Prince of Wales’s Theatre, had the misfortune to
“ mash” the Countess of Desart—since divorced by
the “ noble Earl,” who has married Miss Bischoffs-
heim, daughter of a Vienna banker worth
millions. Lady D. used to go and see Charles
every night, and after a bit Lord D. began to
entertain suspicions. It was thought in London,
at the time, that the reason he entertained sus-
picions was because the Countess entertained Mr.
Sugden. But they are as feeble in London, some-
times, as we are out hero. Eh ? You must posi-
tively learn also—as wo have learned—that Mr.
Sheridan and Louise Davenport have travelled to
Boston to see Irving and Ellen Terry, and have
announced themselves through the columns of
the S. F. Music and Drama as having been
“perfectly satisfied." Now it you dare to laugh we
will kill you. And our lively friend, “ the beau-
tiful Miss Lingard,” has appeared in yet another
matinie—v live-act play, “ Agnes of Bavaria,” this
time, by “ Mr. W. Hawley,” whose identity we
suspect to be identical—tautological this—with
that of Captain Hawley Smart, autho r of “ Breczie
Laugton,” a pleasant though rather flippant novel.
It is not, however, put on record how many times
since last mail Luscombe has thrashed an infuri-
ated hub. And what else interests us ?
•»
We looked in to see the Clark and
Ryraan’s play “Fun in a Palace Car,” at the
Masonic Hall, the other night. What struck us
principally about “ Fun in a Palace Car” was that
there was very little “ Palace Car” about it, though
there was some fun. Wo are going to notice
“ Muldoon’s Picnic" next week, when we shall
probably come out in a green cover.
• • * *
And, fancy! we were just forgetting
George Darrell! Although we could hardly do
that—even on a holiday. Well, “The Sunny
South ” has still a “ sunny shine ” (Quoted from
the Shroud.), and whenever George appears there
is joy in the pit, enthusiasm in the stalls, and
ecstacy in the circle. Wo wanted to say a lot
about the 4th act; but we don’t like to keep our
friends waiting, as we are going to Coogee in a
van.
HEALTH HINTS.
THE ART DISPLAY AT SANDS’S.
There can bo no doubt that the public of Sydney
are beginning to appreciate the enterprise of Mr.
John Sands in continuing his series of art exhibi-
tions for the seasons. The result, of course, is a
mutual benefit. Mr. Sands’ enterprise, after
much discouragement, is being well recognized,
while, on his part, the display made in his galleries
is tending day by day to encourage a taste for the
fine arts which must be productive of good to the
community. In this colony, of course, the great
mass of the population is absorbed in active
business, with but little time to make a selection
of art subjects for home embellishment. At the
galleries, however, which Mr. John Sands has
opened at his establishment in George-street, next
the Post Office, the works of all the best artists in
the world are brought together—works in oils,
water colours, or the finer highly-prized steel-
plate engravings; and from these a splendid selec-
tion can at all times be made. And for the
first time in these colonies these magnificent
art productions of the English and Continental
schools are procurable by the public at exactly
the London and Continental publishers’ prices.
The character and variety, the unrivalled excel-
lence, and the numerous collection as well, of the
productions shown in Mr. Sands’s galleries, point
to the fact of a very heavy Investment of capital
in this newline of business; and it Is to be pre-
sumed that this is the explanation of the very easy
terms on which the public are now met. And here
one word may be said of the gentlemen who make
the selection in the home publishing galleries, for
Australian tastes and requirements. Few men
could have exhibited better judgment. Without
hardly any exception, the selections have been in
complete harmony tvith the happiness and sun-
shine of life in Australia; and the best furnished
private galleries in any of the colonies could find
here very valuable additions, indeed. Every faci-
lity is offered tor inspection; in fact, Mr. Sands’s
galleries have, for months past, been a fashionable
rendezvous ot an afternoon, an inspection of the
collection being a thorough treat. And, as an
indication of present results, it may be mentioned
that over two-thirds of the whole of the artist’s
E roofs of the celebrated picture, *’ The Widower,”
ave been taken for Australia (particularly
N S W.), through Mr. Sands’s gallery. With
the close of the year, the Spring Exhibition
of art subjects terminated ; and on the 2nd
of January commenced what Mr. Sands has
long been desirous of carrying out. There has
been a well-founded complaint among colonial
artists that there have been no really practical
means of disposing of their productions to the
general public. There hare been Innumerable
exhibitions and art-unions, but the results have
at all times been unsatisfactory, and by no means
certain. Mr. Sands has now arranged to accom-
modate all colonial artists at his new galleries.
The productions in oils and water-colours of the
best colonial artists will form the Summer Exhi-
bition at Mr. Sands’s galleries; and as the visitors’
list for the three months is likely to run up to
near upon 150,000 people, some gratifying results
may be looked for. The collection of colonial
artists’ works is likely to be the best yet yet shown
to the public. Over 100 subjects in water colours
and oils have been named for a place in the gal-
lery, and we will not be surprised if the public are
found promptly liberal in their investments. The
galleries will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. each
day during the Summer months, so that ample
facility is offered the public to . ake an inspection
or a purchase by way of encouragement to colonial
art.
We see that a complimentary banquet
is to be given by the Oddfellows to “ M. Kidston,
Esq., Grand Sire of Australia.” Surely Mr. Kidston
has good grounds tor action against those who
thus advertise him. However, we hope to see
several grand sires of Australasia on the show*
ground next year.

Despite the fact that the Prince of Wales
to some degree patronised Henry Irving the
tragedian has not the entree to first society.
Neither Irving nor any other actor is ever seen m
a crack club of the West End, or at a State ball or
levee. It is true, as Irving himself said at the
banquet, ‘‘The time has gone by when there is
any need to apologise for the actor’s calling.” Hut
better men than he have found how impenetrable
are the barriers with which the British aristocracy
hedge themselves around. Many people, notwith-
standing his fame, don’t see any greatness ip
Irving. The fact is that, commencing an actor 8
life at 19, he was for nearly twenty years unheard
of. It was only a few years ago when he took the
notice of Baroness Burdett-Coutts—an estimable,
aged lady, no doubt, but hardly to be supposed a
better judge of acting than any other old
lady—that Irving’s genius was unearthed.
Probably, it was such a passing lancy as any of
the sex are liable tj ajt any moment: bufas tpe
Baroness was rich. In Irving’s case tpp result was
he was a made man. With her patronage, her
Lyceum Theatre, and her cheque-book at his back,
he began those elaborate Shakespearian represen-
tations, with splendid scenery and countless of
cost, which, by the aid of the press, made tpe
theatre a gigantic draw, and Irving a “great tra-
gedian.” He is a shrewd man. Bebind the scenes,
there is a small room where is spread every'night
a rcchrrchi supper, for which the critics have a
standing invitation. It is not difficult to write
pleasant things after partaking of it. From the
tune Jrv'ing has been backed by the cheque-book
of the Baroness, the papers have spoken well of
him. Before that, he was not spoken of at all-

The Minister of Justice has declined to

who yearn for the boon of seeing horsehair, silk

reason the boon’s denied them is because those
places are off the railway line, and the Judges
don’t like travelling unless in an easy carriage.
Foolish Westerners! Wo wish we lived off the

about contempt of court, privilege, libel, and

Colonel Browne, erst of the Connaught
Rangers, and a bona fide “Crimean hero,” has
been victimising Ballarat with his valueless

Legion of Honour who has developed into « che-
valier d’industrie, and possibly won’t be the last.
For the Ballarat snobs, who thought they had
hooked a distinguished swell in the one-armed
Ranger, we haven’t the least sympathy. It may
please them, however, to know th«t they've been
done Browne in company with the snobs of close
upon every large town in this continent—and that
by a fellow whose military title is as straight as
that of Wolseley or our own Abednego.
Lord Rosebery has spoken “admiringly”
(thank goodness!) of the way in which many Vic-
torian towns are laid out, and the Melbourne
Herald, in commenting upon his condescension,
remarks that "such approbation on the part of
our distinguished visitor is gratifying.” So it is,
very gratifying; furthermore, it is reassuring, for,
if the “distinguished visitor” had expressed a
contrary opinion, it would have been necessary to
build those towns over again. His Lordship
approves of trees in the public thoroughfares,
and so the Melbourne City Council have decided
to plant some at once in their busiest streets. If
the noble stranger makes anymore little sug-
gestions. they will, doubtless, be adopted. Evi-
dently, Melbourne dearly loves a Lord.
In South Australia, as in other places
further east, there are various official modes of
dealing with official irregularity. One defaulter’s
I.O.U. was x-ecently taken for his deficit. Another
was allowed to retire, the missing money to be
reckoned as retiring allowance! Another (who is
not particularly well-connected) is to be prose-
cuted criminally. In N.S.W., there are several
officials still holding high position whose treat-
ment of Government moneys in their custody has
been every bit as crooked as that alleged against
Duff, yet in whose cases prosecution was never so
much as hinted at. One offender, it is said, con-
sidered himself hardly used that he wasn’t pro-
moted to an Under-Secretaryship only a year or
two after his little game had been condoned.
Some good hard swearing was got through
in connection with an application for renewal of
license for one of the Melbourne hotels. A former
barman and a senior constable testified to the
drunken habits of the landlady, while a restaurant
keeper stated distinctly that she was frequently—
three times a week-intoxicated, and that she
"Jumped on her sister.” On tho other hand
certain witnesses, including an ex-M.L.A.,
declared her to bo of most sober habits, even
refusing 1 “to take a glass of wine when invited.
The Bench, evidently considering that a lady who
“ refused a glass of wine,” and was championed by
an ex-M.b.A., must be a model of propriety,
granted the license unanimously, and In very
complimentary terms. So much for the sanctity
of an oath.
Henry William Ward feels that the days
of persecution are not yet over. A few days ago
he appeared before the Fltzroy (Vic.) court with a
fraud summons in his hand, and his face betokened
that the iron of tyranny had entered his soul. He
admitted that he owed the £5 3s. for board and
lodging, but averred that ho couldn’t think of
making any reasonable arrangements for paying
It off, as between himself and his wile he only
earned £14 a week. “I am a professional,” he
said ; “ 1 make £4, and my wife makes £10, weekly,
but I don’t see my way to conveniently meet this
little account.” “You must meet it, Henry,’
whispered the Bench, “or go inside for fourteen
days.” Henry, while feeling about for the money,
Intimated that he thought't a barefaced mockery
for Fitzroy to call itself part of a free country.
There is a mechanical and industrial ex-
hibition going on in Melbourne at the present
time, and our old friend, Dr. L. L. Smith, as presi-
dent of the Engineers’ Association, is indulging in
those subtle expressions for which he has an
Australasian fame. For instance, after proclaim-
ing the exhibition open, he went on, in reply to
Mr. Munro, to say that “if the trustees had not
done much so far, they had tried to avoid acting
so as to obtain censure.” This sentence admits of
a lot of readings. It implies that “ acting so as to
obtain censure” was not alone a possibility to
those trustees, but that they had to tonic them-
selves to resist the temptation to so act. Tonic
themselves? No, we won’t tell the tipple.
Medicines “sealedfrom observation," of course.
And it also implies that they didn’t do much else
than tonic themselves all the time. And it also
implies that the trustees were acting for a com-
pany of querulous, carping critics. Take it
altogether, it is one of those sentences that if you
look into your heart and write about will make
you call yourself a fool for the pains.
Dr. Singleton, of Melbourne, is a compas-
( sionatoman. His bump of benevolence is nearly
the size of the Exhibition dome, and the stream of
kindliness that works through his system is nearly
ns loner as the Yarra. Ho went to the Melbourne
Gaol the other day; and, as he wandered around
, the 20J cells of that dismal retreat, he saw in the
faces of the haggard inmates that one thing was
wanting to make them happy—they had no copies
ot the Bible. The bump throbbed, the stream
rippled, and he at once put down his name to
supply 200 Bibles or Testaments annually. But
Governor Magee wouldn’t have them. “ Have
lots of them things,” said the old man, “ and don’t |
want no more.” Dr. Singleton now appeals to the
Ministry—and, in particular, to Graham Berry—to j
to obtain admission for those agencies of reform.
We hope he will succeed. Jt will add to the plea-
sure of colonial life to be able to know that the
embezzling stone-breakers and burglarious white-
washers are each thumbing a Bible presented to
them by command of Graham Berry. It will add
to the pleasure of colonial life, we say, for it will
give Victorians a further excuse for swearing.
A cheer went up at the S®uth Melbourne
Court-house when the Bench told one Nathan
that twelve months’ hard labour would about
meet his cose. Notice of appeal was given at
once, so that it is quite on the cards that Samuel
may escape the year’s stone-fracturing. He was
the owner of a furniture warehouse conducted on
the time-payment system. Brothels of every de-
gree of “respectability ” were furnished by him,
and he thrived amazingly, living on the proceeds
of prostitution, just tho same as the women using
his goods, and, no doubt, attending Synagogu e and
attracting tho attention of Jehovah by the ardour
of his responses. But we need not travel from
honu to discover people who let their houses,
knowing them to bo intended for Immoral pur-
poses, nnd, by doing so, become shareholders in
the traffic of debauchery. There they are—guests
at Government House, orators in Assembly and
City Council, elders of churches, prominent
citizens of respectability as faultless as their shirt-
fronts—all (why mince matters ?) drawing a living
from that prostitution they denounce so fiercely
in public. If we could only get a few of them in
the dock like Sam Nathan, and send a packing-
needle through the bladder of their “respect-
ability!” We Jive jn hope.
On the 17th instant, in the Supreme Court, j
Sydney, the Chief Justice remarked (Windeyerand
Innes, Justices, concurring—by the bye, the word
“concur” is a good term in such a connection)
that the present rules for the admission of attor-
neys, solicitors, and proctors had been framed to
take the place of others which had been relaxed
to such an extent that persons were admitted who
never ought to have been, and some of these had
been struck off the rolls because they were calculated
to bring tho administration of justice into dis-
credit. We should like to know bow many attor-
neys there are still on the rolls who in Sir James
Martin’s opinion ought to be off—the balance, in
fact, between the “ some who have been struck off
the rolls because they were calculated to bring the
administration of justice into discredit” and those
“ who never ought to have been admitted.” Had
we made a remark so grossly aspersive of a large
section of Supreme Court officials, and professional
gentlemen (by Act of Parliament), we suppose
we’d have been run in for contempt. Attorney-
dom wouldn’t have been comforted until the
calumniator had been mulct in many shekels, or
immured in dungeon fast. But now that Lawyer-
dora has been aspersed by its own boss Pundit, it
mustn’t feel surprised if the community exagger-
ate his dictum, and put down some 75 per cent, of
tho attorneys, solicitors, and proctors as follows
extremely fortunate in not having been struck off
the rolls, though fully deserving of that considera-
tion.
It is just nine years since the “Victorian
Humane Society” was founded. It has now de-
veloped into—here wo cough gently—the “Royal
Humane Society of Australasia;’’ and this with-
out troubling the other colonies regarding their
views on the matter. The Melbourne men worked
the oracle in so neat a manner, that they really
deserve to be complimented on their adroitness.
They applied in an otT-hand, friendly, informal
style to the Governor of N.S.W. for his patronage.
His Excellency, who bears in certain circles—what
circles, we are unable exactly to say—a reputation
as a diplomat of the first water, appears to have
given his assent in a manner which was childlike
and bland, and to have eaten his thistles with
a delightful composure very similar to that
displayed by the eminent Mr. Bob Smith
when munching the bunch of carrots so
temptingly helu out by Earl Rosebery at the
Honorable Toby Barton's dinner. Several other
Australian Governors also gave their patronage.
Whereupon the Victorians, having got their little
venture endorsed with the all-round vice-regal
blessing, found themselves easily able to arrange
with the British Humane Society that the latter
should only send its medals and other awards
through them, and that it, in a word, should wipe
out all the other Australian Humane Societies,
and recognise the Melbourne one, to use a sheep-
stealing phrase, as the only “real M‘Coy.”
When these facts came out, many N S.W. officials
were considerably exercised in mind as to the
manner in which Sydney had been befooled. But
now Mr. "John Wilks,” the President of the
“ Royal Humane Society of Australasia”—humph I
—came forward to hold out a bogus olive branch
in the columns of the S. M. Herald. Johnny
Wilks has the cheek to state that he’s about to ask
the Mayor of Sydney to assist his crowd by calling
a meeting- for the inauguration of a branch in
Sydney. Ye gods! "Sir,” writes Johnny to
Granny, “ may 1 presume to hope that the hearty
co-operation of New South Waies in this matter
will go far towards spreading and strength-
ening the present general desire for a
federation of the colonies?’ (Booh!) "The
federated colonies of Australasia; head office in
Melbourne; branches in Sydney and other small
towns ” is evidently the programme of the Johnny
Wilks’ party. Here is a splendid bit of bunkum.
Wilks, to the Herald editor:—" I will not further
trespass on your valuable space—(jam!)—save to
ask your powerful ass stance—(marmalade)—and
the hearty co-opcration of all of your citizens who
desiie to aldin rewarding the brave -(here Johnny
Wilks scoops in all the inhabitants of New South
with a muck-rake)—and who, whatever differences
of opinion they might have on other intercolonial
matters—” And so on. No, Johnny; the en-
lightened inhabitants of the great and glorious
colony of New South Wales haven’t all 11-inch
ears They don’t all bray, and eat thistles.
They can reward their own braves, and kiss their
own girls. They don’t want your medals, Johnny.
There won’t be any meeting of the Sydney
citizens. The Sydney citizens are big fools enough.
They hand over the control of their beautiful city
to the keepers of whisky-mills, and to persons
whose sense of aestheticism is the result of a life-
long familiarity with the dying words of stuck
pigs, the bellowing of moribund bullocks, and the
lovely sights through which the slaughterman
wades at the Glebe Island abattoirs. But all these
patchouli scented people are under the eye of the
Sydney public. And, Johnny, you are in Mel-
bourne, far away. Don’t thrown your baits into
Sydney, Johnny, or they’ll break your little
tishlng-rod.
Swiss Commissioner’s Speech.
Extract from a speech delivered at the Amphi-
theatre of the Primary College of La Chaux-de-
Fonds, Tuesday, tho 14th day of November, 1876,
by M. Edouard Favre-Perrel, Swiss Commissioner
and juror to the Philadelphia Exhibition:—
On the Waltham “Riverside” Watch.
. • . . “The Waltham Company make the
entire watch—from tho first screw to the case and
dial. It would even be difficult for them to use
our products, so great is the regularity, so minute
the precision, with which their machines work.
They arrive at the regulation of tho watch—so to
say—without having seen it. When the watch is
given to the adjuster, the foreman delivers to him
the corresponding hair-spring and the watch is
regulated. (Sensation among the audience.) Here
is what I have seen, gentlemen I I asked from the
director of the Waltham Company, a watch of the
fifth grade. A large safe was opened before me;
at random I took a watch out of it and fastened it
to my chain. The director, having asked me to
let him have the watch for two or three days, so
as to observe the motion. I answered, ‘ On the con-
trary, I persist in weariag it just as it is. to obtain
an exact idea of your manufacture.’ At Paris, I set
my watch by a regulator on the Boulevard, and on
the sixth day I observed that it had varied 33
seconds. And this watch is of the fifth American
grade; it cost 75 francs (movement without case).
At my arrival at Lode, 1 showed the wafeh to onp
of our first adjusters, who asked permission fo
‘taka it down’—in other words, to take it to
pieces. I, however, wished first to observe it; and
here is the result, which I noted: Hanging, dally
variation, seconds; variation in different posi-
tions, from 4 to 8 seconds; in the ‘heated room,’
the variation was but very slight. Having thus ob-
served it, I handed the watch to the adjuster, who
took it down. After tho lapse of a few days, ho
came to mo and said, word for word: ‘I am com-
pletely overwhelmed: the result is incredible; one
would not find one such watch among 50,000 of our
manufacture.’
“ This watch, gentlemen, 1 repeat to you, I took
at hazard—out of a heap, as we say. You under-
stand, from this example, that the Waltham watch
may be preferred to the Swiss. I have finished,
fentlomen, and I have told you of things such as
have seen them. It remains for us to profit
from this sad experience, and to Improve our
manufacture. Competent men are not wanting
among us; they must go to work at once.”

A Happy New Year.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that “Eighty-three” is waning,
All its days so nearly gone,
I have found my heart complaining
Of my past year’s goings-on;
For, although things can t be mended.
Yet I feel a sense of shame
When I think the year now ended
Brings no credit to my name.
All Its chances have been wasted,
Thrown with idle hand away,
While of wicked joys I’ve tasted
In a reckless, idle wav.
’Stead of walking righteous courses.
And prescribing for my soul,
I’ve been putting “ quids" on horses
(And preferred it, on the whole).
Far too often I’ve been tempted
To the subtle game of Pool,
Till my pockets have been emptied
(They are empty, as a rule).
But I'm sick of playing “ fifty ”
Which the other follow wins.
So I’ll alter, and be thrifty
When the glad New Year begins.
Quite regardless of the Joking
Of my careless brother bards,
I intend to give up smoking
And to “ cut ” those awful cards:
No more I’ll go “ deep-sinking ”
In that bad colonial beer—
’Twill bo just as well, I’m thinking,
For it always makes me queer.
I’ll attend at church each Sunday
(Which I haven’t done of late).
And my breakfast, after Monday,
Shall be polished off at eight.
I have loved my bed too dearly,
’Mongst my many little sins,
But I mean to get up early
When the glad New Year begins.
Thus I’ll break off all connection
With the life I’ve lived of yore,
And will strive to be “ perfection ”
When we come to Eighty-four;
While, that nothing may debar me
Of success in this my plan,
I intend to join the “ Harmy,”
As a “ Captain”—if I can.
Once secure in that position,
It is needless, quite, to say
That my former sad condition
Will be changed in every way:
(I have made this statement solely
On the well established fact
That a “ Captain ” must bo holy—
In thought and word, and act.)
Deo. 30.
Our “Waterloo” Heroes.
”The Gods are dead.”
’Neath the brow where Our Lady of Carmel looks
over the city
A foul deed was done;
But her Lmiyuhip's eyes dm not see, more’s the
pity!
Help rendered she none!
Perchance she was journeying, or sleeping—
Perchance she was sick:
Howe’er 'twas, one Jong wail of agonised weeping
Touched her not to tho quick.
To the Mother of Him whom wo’re taught is
So mighty to save.
The shriek ot tho outcast as naught is—
On this side the gravel
Ye fools, who still go, as priest-bidden.
Who the battle with sin
Leave to priestcraft, deaf, dumb, and bedridden
Without and within,
Wake up to the Truth, that's so near you—
Trust nor Mother nor Father
In a fa'-away Heaven, but just clear you
By Human means, rather;
And “got at” tho works of tho slums, fetid, hell-
ish, accurs’d.
By cleansing things here.
And leave to tho Future its priest-defined worst—
And the Present will brighten, no fear I

J.S.
Hide and Seek.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tla the afternoon of a Summer day; all nature
bedecked with verdure gay;
The purple bee, from each blossom so rare, her
sweet ambrosia gleans with care,
And feathered songsters, brightsome and free, trill
forth their notes right merrily;
Two children, ripe tor frolic and freak, are playing
a game of “ Hide and Seek.”
A happy girl with a glowing face, a laughing boy
in an eager cause:
She breathless lies 'neath the hedges green, and
watches him thence, herself unseen.
Now slipping behind a stout old tree, notes every
move with a Joyous glee;
But the boy’s pursuit tie keen and fast, and the
laughing girl is caught at last.
A maiden sits in a leafy bower, scatt’ring the bloom
of a broken flower;
Here eyes are filled with a tender light—ah I
maiden, wherefore that smile so bright ?
A gallant youth is beside her now, and the colour
mounts to her maiden brow.
The blush of love is on her cheek; they are play-
ing a game of “Hide and Seek.”
The sun is sinking away to rest, her lovely head
droops on his breast;
A young man’s voice says, soft and low, “ My
darling love, I love you so,
My heart is throbbing for you alone, my queen,
my empress, my joy, my own!”
The vow is spoken—ne’er more to part—the youth
has captured the maiden’s heart.
The game is over, the play is done, the maid is
conquered, the youth has won.
True love is holy, its joy is pure; it never faileth,
and can endure.
Thus simply Nature runs her course —no bar
opposes her gentle force;
The hearts of the youthful hear her speak as they
play their games of “ Hide and Seek.”
G.W.R.
Manager (with emotion): “Look here now, Murphy, there’s nothing doing. We
want a sensation. We’ve either got to get up a marriage between you and Maggie, or
close the show—take your choice!”


Political Points
It used to be said of Lord Palmerston
that though at the Home Office he was all abroad,
no man couH be more at home at the Foreign
Office. Somewhat similarly might not one say of
Sandy Stuart, that his militant Scotch mug suits
the N.S.W, Ministry of War all to peaces ?
London Society, with ultra-Tory pre-
dilections in favour of the good old times of
North, and Loughborough, and Castlereagh,
shrieks out: “ What a farce, liberty, equ«lity, and
fraternity, is in the hands of a godless, illiterate,
and selfish Government,” Just as if piety, culture,
and self-sacrifice wore the peculiar attributes of a
“ Divine-right” supported oligarchy.
Sir Henry Parkes, in the Nineteenth
Century, recommends (1) that there should be an
Australasian Federal Council, and (2) that the locus
of the said Council should be London. Parkes
should be impeached for treason to all his best and
most Liberal convictions. The Federal Council of
Australasia in session in London would simply
mean the rigime of the absentee and the shoddy
importer.
Next to being a clerk in the Lands Depart-
ment, give us the billet of an Afghan, Egyptian,
or Zulu prince at loggerheads with our subjects,
and supported by dear old obstinate John Bull.
The Khedive is now threatening to resign unless
“Johnny” puts down El Mohdy for him, while
Johnny sulks and swears a little at the mess he is
in through volunteering to become debt-collector
for a flock of Hebraic cormorants.
It is undoubtedly a serious reflection on
the genius, the talent, the patriotism of the soi-
disant independent members of the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment, that of late days the only earnest, consistent
efforts made with an honest view to expose cor-
ruption, jobbery, and nepotism, should have been
the efforts of a comparative youngster. It may
be fashionable—indeed, it is so with the Civil Ser-
vice lah-de-dah and his congeners—to sneer at the
“Giraffe,” yet ’tis impossible to deny that that
long-necked-and long-headed—fellow is poking
his head into no end of holes in which Tite
Barnacleism has too too long enjoyed a boundless
o Hum sine any dignitate.
Service still says he is not responsible for
Speaker Barton’s name having been mentioned in
connection with the Argus report of bis blowful
speech on the Convention proceedings. This may
be quite true in a strictly quibbling sense: but,
inasmuch as “the eminent Parliamentary autho-
rity ” he referred to was Mr. Speaker Barton, Mr.
Service has merely succeeded by his disingenuous
diplomacy in superimposing upon his character
for commercial canniness the deserved reputation
of being considered a past-master in the art of
evasion. [When the N.S.W. libel law has been
fixed up a bit, we shall be able to make sentences
[ike the foregoing a little shorter.]
England refers Tewflk to the Sublime
Pprtp, in his Ijttle trouble with the “False”
Prophet, who came upon him so soudanly. This
move would seem to indicate that the British
Jiolder of Egyptian bonds feels he ought to draw
he ljne somewhere, and that that “somewhere ”
•egiiis at about the latitude whence Hicks made
ps' exit. If England—the Nation, not the jobbers
who pose as sich—wpuld only honestly go in for
righteous bottle-holding ’twixt Turkey and the
Mqhdy (whosp port is at present a precious sight
sublimer th«n the Sultan’s) we should rejoice—
more particularly should we rave with delight
were the Mohdy to make a dean sweep of Abdool,
Tewflk and Co.
“It is said— and likely enough there is
truth in the report—that a section of the Egyptian
society yearns for the return of Ismail to the
supreme rule in El Mizr. No doubt the bummers
and the drum ers, the exploiteurs and the epicene
harlotry of Cairo, would prefer the jovial-corrupt
sensual-bestial Ismail to the timid-corrupt, prig-
gish-Anglomaniac Tewflk; but as for the people of
Egypt, wo know what they would prefer—Arab!
restored (guaranteed by the Powers and at peace,
as a Mahommedan potentate should bo with El
Mohdy), the bondholder referred for payment to
those who got his money—in a word, Egypt for
the Egyptians. And so far as Britain’s real interest
and true honour are concerned, it wouldn’t be a
bad programme.
The S. M. Herald so very rarely speaks
out straight—so frequently essays to do the trick
by running with the hare and hunting with the
hounds—that we confess we weren’t in the least
degree surprised when we read its words in com-
pliant excuse of those British “ bear ”-ing brokers
who tried to dish the successful floating of the
N.S.W. three million loan. Says the Herald:—
“The brokers render us a service when they take
a loan off our hands, and it would be unreasonable
to expect them to render that service for no-
thing.” Considering that thejbroker, like any other
middleman, la at best but a necessary evil (to put it
the way most favorable to him), there is something
positively indecent in the leading metropolitan
daily patting the foreign “ boar” on the back, and
maintaining that its only right he should have his
little “loot,”
“ He sows, but he shall not reap.” If there
be kudos of any kind distilling itself from this
annexation rumpus, a big bottle of it should be
given to Sir Thomas MTlwraith. In fact, if people
were just, it ought to be all put in a jar
and left at his lodgings. Sir Thomas has been
staying in a private hotel in Melbourne. The town
is sitting up talking about New Guinea, and point-
ing at the shadows of Service and half a dozen
others astride of a moon-beam sailing to the realm
of glory. Even “ boots,” groping along the lobby,
and Bridget In the scullery think .the delegates
immortalized. But Sir Thomas is not even a
delegate. He dragged the subject from obscurity,
rolled it in a ball, threw in on the political lawn,
and stripped to kick itto goal. But, presto I Other
heels and toes are at work, Sir Thomas is out of
the game, and the kudos is divided among others!
We protest that the only thing in the whole ques-
tion that struck our fancy was Sir Thomas sending
up the police-magistrate to annex New Guinea
with a walking-stick and a box of crackers, and
we are grieved to find that he is now displaced by
a lot of spouters who will strut all over the annexa-
tion page of Australian history, and shut the
valorous man up in a little private spot with his
“indiscretion” on his knee.
Had the lurid Piddingstonsky been per-
mitted his own way, Dibbs would now be in gaol
again on a charge of conspiring against the dignity
ot the “Lords”—an Australian Guido Fawkes,
indicted by the Usher of the Black Rod for insi-
diously seeking to inoculate the serene atmo-
sphere of the N.S.W. Legislative Council with
miasmatic germs from the seventy-live erysipelas
and small-pox beds he had surreptitiously insinu-
ated (for the accommodation of the Government
supporters during the stonewalling of the Land
Bill) into the Hail sacred to the twin geniuses of
Dull Platitude and Impotent Pomposity. Some
people cannot see that there was any breach of
parliamentary privilege in Dibbs’ action; and it is
just this which makes Pid. so mad. He thinks that
such an Indecent infringement of the privileges of
the Upper ’Ouse could only have emanated from
some larrikin who had been accustomed to the
society of Darlinghurst Gaol—a place, Iby the
bye, where sometimes the society is particularly
good—eh, Dibbs? yet, as Hay put it, the matter
has its serious side. A lot of “disorganised”
Lower House fellows to be snoring on the tioor of
a Chamber whose walls are wont to echo to the
strains of Piddingtonskian and Jacobian oratory-
why the very thought suggests, to a small mind li ke
Jacobs, the idea of l«se—excessively lazy—majesty.
The hardened Dibbs the prime offender, Stuart
his abandoned accomplice, and the volatile
Dailey who sought to turn the thing into a jest,
must be impeached. Our Pids, our Jacobs, our A.
Campbells must not be contaminated, nor, if it
can be avoided, laughed at. Fancy the ribald
impertinence of that fellow Dailey saying that he
was sometimes tempted to wish In his own and in
the public’s Interest that Pid. would himself use
the Upper Chamber more frequently as a place of
perfect quiet and repose I As for Sir John Hay,
he’s old enough to nave learned the wisdom of
turning a blind side to a certain class of occur-
rences. His notes to Stuart about the Invasion of
his territory were in bad form, as might have
been expected. What Hay (or the hon.
gentlemen of Her Majesty’s Opposition) should
have done, when he or they twigged the not over
nice-looking mattresses in the sacred hall, was to
have said nothing nothing about it, but to have
quietly and cannily cayenne-peppere 1 or cow-
itched the bedding, and awaited the result—MP.’s
fleeing, howling, from a Chamber of Horrors.

In view of existing Ministerial arrange-
ments, it wouldn’t be amiss to revive an old Par-
liamentary expression, and, instead of calling,the
Government underground-engineer the “ whip,”
to call himthe “undertaker.” Parson Jefferis
maintains that the recent Convention has proved
very conclusively that Federation is demanded by
the people of Australasia. He evidently imagines
that he, his brother black-coats, and some score
or so of K.C M.G.-ship-hunting gushers are the
people of Australasia. ‘Tis, in fact, the tailors of

BRIEF MENTION.
The M.L.C.’s of N.S.W. object to beds
being- placed in the Council Chamber. They don’t
like anyone to sleep there but themselves.
The D.T.’s Melbourne sjribe, in his
detailed report of the Intercolonial cricket match,
deposes that Lewis was “ bowled by Garrett with
a snorter.” Until we read that, we’d no idea that
Windeyer, J„ was in any way in it.
THE GOOD OLD WAY.
The way to “a merry Christmas,”
And to “a happy New Year,”
Seems to make oneself an isthmus
Between two seas of beer;
Or, more to improve the style yet,
In rum to stand a hot islet.
Thus the Christian honours the day of “Re-
mission
Of Sins” by a souse In liquid perdition.
Here is a slab of the Echo’s notice of
Sydney Liedertafel concert: —“The thin-finger of
dark discontent rose volcano-like as a warning of
the eruption to come. . . Her rays lighted up
the Schiller-like face and animated the soul of the
new conductor. . . As though a band of lovers
simultaneously poured out their wealth of love in
harmony,” &c., &c. Mart dc noire vie! The
Melbourne fellow who criticised Ketten never
crawled up as high as the “ thin linger of dark
discontent.” It reminds us of the Yankee who
commenced an ode to the ocean with “ profound
dampness.”
The editor of the West Coast Times,
(N.Z.), can fix up a very neat editorial footnote.
En void:— “Arahura Maori School.—To the
Editor.—Sir, In noticing the departure of Mr.
Curtis, late teacher of the Arahura Maori School,
in your issue of Monday last you say:—‘Mr.
Curtis, during his five years’ residence here,
earned the esteem of the residents, and the Maoris
particularly regret the departure of Mrs. Curtis,
who endeared herself to them by many acts of
kindness.’ Now, Mr. Editor, we can assure you
the Maoris have no cause to regret the departure
of Mr. and Mrs. Curtis, but on the contrary, are
very pleaded that such an event has taken place.—

Curtis were very particular in Inculcating the

The advantages of a Victorian State School
education are becoming more apparent every day.
The late Inspector-General and several of the
reigning teachers have done their best to intro-
duce a high moral tone among the fortunate Vic-
torian youngsters, and now certain members of
a School Board have been indulging in “rough
and tumble,” with the idea, doubtless, of develop-
ing healthy athletic tendencies among their little
charges. On the occasion of the presentation of
prizes to the successful pupils attending the
Brunswick (Melb.) School, a Mr. Fleming—member
of the Board, and J.P.—was desirous of giving
four extra prizes on his own account; but this
arrangement not meeting with the approval of
“ the powers that be,” Mr. Stranger—Chairman of
the Board, and J P.— attempted to curb Mr. Flem-
ing’s unauthorised generosity, and the two gen-
tlemen struggled together on the platform for the
possession of the books. It was a drawn battle,
and the whole matter is to be laid before the
Minister of Education ; but the children have
benefited, inasmuch as they have anew game now
—playing at J.P.’s.
Mrs. Dugdale, of Camberwell, has been
telling the Victorians what a good man is, and
what a good woman is. We had been under the
Impression that a good man in Victoria was a suc-
cessful politician, no matter how he came to be
successful; or a money-lender, who was also a
churchwarden; or an insolvent, who agitated
strenuously to have the Bible read in State schools.
But it seems we were wrong, Mrs, Dugdale says
that he is a man of large moral courage, “ who
not only thinks honestly, but acts in like manner,”
About the good woman in Victoria we were also
astray. Wo had thought her a woman who spe-
cially affected church bazaars, who ran her hus-
band into debt to fittingly adorn herself for a
stand of faldals, and who exerted her motherly
influence to make her daughter of 16 marry the
octogenarian paralytic—“ as, my dear, his position
is so good.” Mrs. Dugdale thinks her noble and
true, “400 times more so than man,” and not at
all given to the ways of pious exhibition. Wo are
glad to have erroneous impressions removed; but,
then, what are we to do with the hosts of men and
women in Victoria we have been calling good sc
long? We fear that, out of very custom, we’ll
stick to our old standards.
The Tenterfield Star tells a story of
how a lady and a gentleman were driving in a
buggy along one of the roads up there, and the
lady saw a horseshoe lying in the middle of the
way. She got the gentleman to stop the buggy,
and then she alighted and picked the horseshoe
up. This was because it is not lucky to pass a
horseshoe. And, says the Star, emphatically,
“ Mark what followed. The stoppage caused a
delay of two minutes. Just as they started again,
a large limb fell with a terrific crash, right across
the track in front of them. The gentleman looked
at his watch, drove to the spot, again took the
time, and found it exactly two minutes. If they
had not stopped to pick up that horseshoe, they
would have been postponed sine die.” We knew
two incidents just like this. One occurred when
we were young, but we recollect it as if it were
yesterday. A man was driving through a cutting
in a trap. He stopped to pick up a horseshoe
lying in the road. Just then a tremendous rock
fell from the top of the cutting right in front of
the trap. But the man was not hurt by it. He
broke his neck in falling off the trap when he tried
to pick up the horseshoe. There is great virtue in
horseshoes. Then we remember a man who was
driving into a market-town, when a weasel ran
across the road. He considered this an unlucky-
omen, and turned back. That very same hour,
the bridge over the river broke down, and
drowned several people who were passing over it
just at the time when he would have been cross-
ing it if ho had gone on. So the weasel saved him,
and he lived. Yes, he lived—to be hanged.
“ Listener ” contributes to the Quean-
beyan Gale a paper, on the dangers attendant
upon promiscuous cursing, from which wo gladly
make the following quotation in the earnest hope
it may tend to chock the too frequent use of tlie
big big T) :—“I fear that if many do not refrain
from such conduct (the use of the big big D.),
some dreadful Providential judgment will over-
take them, oven in this world. It would be well
for such to rellect upon what happened to three
young men at Amsterdam (we wonder “Listener ’
didn’t spell this word “Amstei'd—”) when Mr.
Fleming was preaching on the Sabbath. He re-
proved thorn three times before the congregation,
but they persisted; and then, with an awful pause,
he told them that ho was impressed with a divine
message, which was that not one of the three of
them would live the week out. On the Tuesday,
one was going for a voyage, but through a storm
the ship was driven on to the coast, and he was
plunged into eternity; on the Wednesday, an-
other had a quarrel and fought with swords, and
he was killed; and the other, on Thursday, was
taken seriously ill. Ho sent for a minister to pray
for his life, which ho said ho had no power to do,
but he prayed for his soul, and soon after the
minister left him ho died in agony of despair.”
Joking apart, when tnis is the sort of blasphemous
rubbish—blasphemous to Humanity—that “Lis-
teners ” write, we cease to wonder that, they
(listeners) never hear any good of themselves.
We don’t cotton to the use of the D. When un-
necessarily used, it’s bad form; but occasionally
one can’t do without it,— ex. gr. “ damned ass ” is
the sole expression that suds “ Listener ” down to
the ground.
Instead of being lowered down the shaft,
a cage containing tour men was the other day
drawn up to the poppet-heads of a Victorian mine.
The rest of the story is soon told. It is the old sad
one of the sacrifice of strong men and the widow-
hood of helpless women through scandalous neg-
ligence. The safety appliances failed when failuie
meant destruction, and the ill-fated miners reached
the bottom only to And deal h instead of their mat< s
awall ing them. But there is one aspect ol the case
—by far the most important, in our opinion—Thar,
has scarcely been touched upon by the daily pm a
The engine-driver who was directly responsible L r
the affair was a religious enthusiast—one who saw
visions and dreamed dreams: who belonged to the
Salvation Army, and taw in that organization the
means of redemption and grace. Fanatics have lei t
their mark on some of the mostimportantpagesin
the world’s history: they shaped the fortunes of
nations. Under them, the inhospitable wastia
of Spam and Northern Africa became gardens, and
Sweden a puissant power. Cromwell’s psalm-
singing Ironsides taught European captains that
a penchant tor Scriptural proper names was a help
rather than a hindrance to military prowess. Hut
it is different with engine-driving. If the scene of
our daily work lay 500 feet below the ground, and
not in a sumptm us building on the surface, and
if the choice were given us of being lowered by
a visionary or by an atheist, wo would choose the
sceptic. He would be less likely to haul us to the
Poppet-heads—more apt to understand the signals
of distress, as we hung helplessly over the yawning
pit below. To our mind, the habit of placing the
lives of men in the hands of one who sees, in the
crowd of slatternly women and malodorous hob-
bledehoys usually composing a Salvationist’s choir,
a resemblance to the fair-haired maidens and
epicene neutrals who warble on the slopes of Zion,
should be at once discontinued.
NEW YEAR’S RESOLVES.
“II—U is paved with good intentions.”
All those New Year’s resolutions,
Would bring forth, without a doubt,
Grand and mighty revolutions
Were they only carried out.
If ’tis true that “ good intention ”
Paves a certain sultry way,
Then, there’s little need to mention,
’Twas well paved on New Year’s Day.
RETROSPECT.
Eighty-three has had its innings—
Drought it’s losses and its winnings—
Bad results from good beginnings—
Line all other years.
Brought its varied joys and passions,
Latest styles and Paris fashions.
Gorgeous feasts and scanty rations—
Laughter, song, and tears.
Brought its scandals and disgraces,
Walks to church and rides to races,
Seen the light of friendly faces
Vanish from the earth;
Seen the maiden wed her lover,
And the wife become a mother—
One year’s very like another—
Marriage, death, and birth.
Eighty-three has had its innings—
Brought its losses and its winnings—
Few good acts, but countless sinnings—
Like all other years;
Brought its usual business troubles,
Vain regrets for backing “doubles,”
Household cares and social bubbles—
Laughter, song, and tears.
NEW VERSION OF AN OLD HYMN.
Rosebery’s haunted by a —myth
With ambrosial hair ;

—myth, too, must be there.
Rosebery wendeth to the shops,
Still the —myth will come:
{At last ) Rosebery, maddened, gives him slops.
“ Off you I” Hum 1
In the far, far frozen regions of tfre North,
there dwelt a Party who was grievously
persecuted by a fiend who was eternally
asking, “Is this cold enough for you ?”
Sore, sipk, sated, irritated, tho-
roughly disgusted witji hearing the
of t-repeated pleasantry, the Party dis-
guised himself in everyday clothes
and fled to other scenes. “ In Aqs?
tralia,” he soliloquised, “theynever
ask one ‘is it cold enough for you.’ ”
Arrived at Sydney, he was met on the
Circular Quay by a mysterious person,
who inquired, with a humorous twinkle
in his eye, “ Well, is this hot enough for
you?”
It was the fiend in disguise, who had
arrived there first.
There was, it would appear, no
escape from the exasperating form
of the question, and so as
above.
The fiend still lives, and is at large.


CHEAP LAND INVESTMENTS.
It is a pretty generally recognised fact that no
purchase of land can now he made in or about
the suburbs of Sydney at the advantageous terms
of two or three years ago, when the great con-
tinuous land Investments lirst commenced. The
result is that as rapid and frequent railway com-
munication bridges the distance of tho estates
beyond tho suburbs, the attention of large and
small Investors is attracted in that direction, and
with regard to these lands advantages correspond-
ing to those of the earliest investments in city
and suburban lots are now offering, and are being
rapidly availed of. For the last month, Messrs.
Pinhey and C of 81 King-street West, have been
announcing sales of land in suitable allotments, at
the Jellore Estate, Shelltop Railway Siding, on the
Great Southern Railway. This is about the most
elevated land on the Southern line, and may be
regarded as the sanltorium of New South Wales.
The change in the air from the dusty metropolis,
and the keen, damp atmosphere of the sea coast,
is; at once apparent to any traveller by train; so
that an investment in an acreage, large or small,
at Jellore, is not only a sound financial step, but
also a provident act in respect of health. There
are no mosquitos to trouble residents, but delight-
fully cool nights. Splendid timber for every use
is procurable on the ground. Tho climate and
soil are favourable to the cultivation of all English
fruits. A practical English gardener, who re-
cently visited the spot, reports that both soil and
climate are all that can be desired. The estate has
been placed in Messrs. Pinhey and Co.’s hands
u nder such advantageous arrangements that they
are enabled to dispose of the land on terms which
give everybody a chance. The land is sold in £3
lots, 5s. deposit, and balance os. per month, with-
out interest. The title is Torrens’, and the trans-
fer is free. Messrs. Pinhey and Co. have similar
advantages to offer in respect of Ascotral Estate,
at Mount Druitt Railway Station, on the Western
lino. The land is at a good elevation, without
rock, scrub, or swamp, and has been laid out on a
capital plan. Ulocks can be purchased at 60s.
each, 10s. down, the balance at 3*. per month.
Messrs. Pinhey and Co. will give every infor-
mation on application.
INTERVIEW WITH LORD ROSEBERY.
A reporter had an interview last week with
the Earl of Rosebery, and some interesting facts
with regard to that distinguished nobleman are
now for publication. The reporter, who was
admitted to Government House under the assump-
tion that he was a poulterer looking tor Christmas
supplies, found the noble Earl sitting on a fence,
smoking a M'Elhonian clay.
“The noble Earl, I presume ?” said the reporter.
“Slightly,” ejaculated his Lordship, instantly
diving for his tobacco-pouch; “ Editor of the
Herald, I suppose ?”— at the same time scanning
his boots.
R.: No, my noble Lord—the Howl; that’s what
I represent. I’ve come to learn the real object of
your visit to Australia.
Earl: Well, fact is I’ve come about this federa-
tion business, and to get a glance at Zulu Thomp-
son's War Scenes, if I can.
R.: Oh, Zulu’s In it. We’d know nothing about
these Avars but for Thompson.
Earl: Ah! Thompson’s a brave felloAv. Many a
night we’ve spent on the tented field. He’s been
in the thick of it, too, and never been shot.
U.j Strange!
Karl: Well, fact is he’s been busy on his Diorama
all the time. In the hottest fire at Rorke’s Drift
he caught a scene, and actually went out and
asked the Zulus just to keep their position tor one
minute, and the thing was done. I saw his sketch
the night after, but have not yet seen it completed
on canvas.
R.: Oh. it’s simply fetching. In the foreground
you see Zulu Thompson shaking an Armstrong
gun at Cctewayo, who is calling on his legions to
skeddadle, as Thompson is to the fore. Is there
any truth that Zulu is a great swordsman ?
Earl: Thompson is one of the greatest killers I
know of off the stage. By tho way, Gladstone
asks whether Zulu has done anything with the
Egyptian War.
R.: Well, rather. He has all the scenes from
artists on the spot.
Earl: I thought he wasn’t at Tel-el-Kebir for
nothing. He was mighty thick with Tewflk
Pasha, and there was no man Arab! more esteemed
than Zulu. I believe he would have been nomi-
nated Khedive - only that he was booked to op?n in
Sydney and show his diorama all this month. There
was great coolness in England when it vvas known
Zulu vvas going to show in Sydney first.
R.: Nonsense; but I do not think Mr. Thompson
meant any slight to Great Britain. He has, I
believe, been forced to decline invitations from
both the Russian and German Emperors.
Earl: You’re right. Perhaps the people here
didn’t knoAv that Zulu and the two Emperors are
very distant now. Decided foolness, in fact,
between tlmm, I'm glad, however, that his
intimate relationship with the King of the
Kannible Islands saves our country from being
involved in war Avith tho Malicolo natives. Does
Zulu carry on the gift business as of yore ?
R,: Of course. A coat mine, last night, given to
apoorwidoAv; and a smoothing-iron and a cross-
cut saw to an eA ening reporter.
Earl: How ever does he do it? The diamond
studs Gladstone wears were the result of a pit
ticket; and this coat—on my oa r h—I got in the
gallery Avhen Zulu was exhibiting before the
Queen.
R.: Now, priv-ately, what does her Majesty think
of Zulu’s Avar scenes.
Earl: You didn’t hear that ho refused a C.M.G.-
ship from the Queen? Fact, though; and it has
since been offered to M’Elhone. W hat night does
Zulu give away nis next suite of furniture ?
R.: Every night. Just before you came, His
Excellency, Lord Augustus, Avas only tvvo behind
the winner of a 33-guinea suite; however, he Avon
a gridiron.
Earl: Ye«, he showed it me. But, joking apart,
Zulu Thompson’s art and prize distribution is a
genuine thing, and fetched the people in every
town in England and the Cape. So now you know
Avhy l’\*e come on to Sydney.
R.: The federation business
Earl: Oh! hang the federation question! I’ve
come hero to oee Zulu Tuompson's diorama of the
two wars, and I shan’t leave till I do see it.
R.: Thanks,
’ Earl: Au revoir. Shall be at Zulu Thompson's
any night this iveek.
Desperate case of mutiny (spiced with
murder, violence, and sudden death) reported
from Brisbane. Swedish schooner " Natal”
(Bustrom, skipper) arrived in Moreton Bay last
week. His report is thus:—November 26, skipper
awakened by a blow from a broad axe; the local
“ chips” posing as catechist. At same time, chief
mate attacked, on the side of his nose, by a rebel-
lious A.B. wkipper and mate, armed with shot-gun
and revolver respectively, attacked by a crew of
five, armed with band and marlin spikes. Skipper’s
son, the second mate, cut down by mutineers and
thrown overooard by a sailor named “ Bill.”
Unarmed mutineers, in order to avoid the captain
ard mate, retire to the hold for four days.
Induced to come out on terms of an amnesty,
“Bill” and “Chips” shot dead by the captain,
whoso ex parte story we have given. “The cap-
tain,” sajs the Brisbane correspondent of the
S. M. Herald, “seems to have exercised great
coolness in putting to death the two who were
Implicated in killing the second mate, and who had
actually tried to murder the captain and mate.”
Perhaps so, but we should like to hear the other
side of the story. When years ago, at a public
meeting at Exeter, or some other clerical hall, the
chairman announced that the Right Rev. Charles
James, of London, couldn't attend owing to a dog
having bitten i Ira in the calf of his gaitered leg, a
sarcastic canon of Paul’s (which his name it was
Smith) remarked that he would like to hear the
dog's version of the story. So with us; wo yearn
to hear what the “remnant” of the Natal’s crew
have to say about all this shooting, axelng, and
“ chucking overboard.”
BIG LAND SALE AT NEWTOWN.
Last Saturday afterday afternoon, and through-
out Monday, a crowd of people visited Bray’
Paddock, at NowtoWn, which is to be submitted
to auction on Saturday week (Jan. 12) by Messrs.
Batt, Rodd and Purves. This is the grandest area
of building sites, either for homes or bu iness,
which is to be found in the suburbs, and it has
been Judiciously kept out of the market till the
site of the first railway station on the lllawarra
lino was decided on- Bray’s Paddock almost abuts
on the new line of railway, and the station is now
being erected within a few feet of the land, im-
parting to it a value that only the opening of
traffic will ultimately be able to fix. The land is
the property of Mr. G. C. Bray, who has resolved
that this last great subdivision of land at Newtown
shall be on a scale that will make a purchase worth
having, whether for business or for residence.
Fancy, 193ft. depths, at Newtown, and at this
time of day—yet such is the fact. The land has
been very carefully laid out in appropriate
allotments by that most competent surveyor,
Mr. C. B. Dawson, and comprises IS building
blocks, with frontages to King-street, better
known as the main Newtown road, and good
streets, not one of which is less than 60 feet
wide. We are much mistaken if this liberal
arrangement doesn’t meet with the most sub-
stantial recognition from investors, of whom
there must be hundreds at Newtown alone. The
land in Bray’s paddoct can never be encroached
upon by clusters of small houses, as all available
ground is taken, and the railway line bars ap-
proach from any other direction. The land is the
highest part of Newtown, and commands mag-
nificent views of Rand wick, Botary, and Cook’s
River, &c, The property is under Torrens title,
so that the transfer is not costly. The auctioneers
have been able to arrange very easy terms for
purchasers, the conditions of sale being 10 per
cent, down, 15 per cent, in three months, without
interest, and the balance in three equal payments
of one, two, and three year. 1 ?, with only 6 per cent,
interest. Every resident in or about Newtown
must be aware that this is the last estate for sub-
division in that populous suburb, and the oppor-
tunity of making a valuable purchase on the
coming 12th January ought certainly not be lost.
A BIG FURNITURE AND BEDDING FACTORY.
The attention of the thou-ands who arrive by the
train at the Sydney terminus is at once arrested
by the sight of Mr. H. J. Lyons’ groat furniture
and bedding factory, situated in Regent-street,
nearly opposite the Mortuary Station. The firm
has been established near upon twenty-five years.
with head centra! offlees and factory in Bridge-
street; but those premises being entirely inade-
quate to the requirements of the past few years*
Mr. Lyons fixed on those splendidly situated and
commodious premises above referred to. The
Regent-street premises comprise the factories,
and at the same time possess magnificent show-
rooms, where an extensive and growing business
is done with the whole South Sydney population
and the great Railway-travelling pu’ lie. The
frontage to Regent-street is about 100 feet, and
a similar advantage is secured with regard to
Kensington-stroet in the rear, the through depth
being not less than 200 feet. Considering that all
this ground space is occnpied by lofty workshops,
stores, and show-rooms, it can be seen that the
accommodation is unusually large; and there is
no doubt the very best use has been made of that
large area. The furniture show-room is about
63 ft. by 40 ft., and in this amply stocked de-
partment every description of furniture is shown
—English, American. Continental, and Colonial—
and for variety- to suit either the citizen, selector,
or capitalist-no better display is to be found any-
where in the city. Adjoiningthis department is the
bedstead and bedding show-rooms; and here some
of the best articles in the line, imported or locally
produced, are on view. Some splendid specimens
of upholstery—done on the premiscs-in.bedding,
couches, settees, etc., are here to be seen: the
material used being the best procurable. Over-
head are several manufacturing departments, the
sewing machine work, in particular, requiring a
large number of expert workers. The steam
machinery branch is of the space of 96 fecLJjy
38 feet, w here a splendid 10 h p. engine driver a
host of the modern appliances for tearing, card-
ing elc At the opposite side of the yard, to which
there is a wide dray-way entrance, are situated
the palliasse factory and storerooms. The factory
has a number of presses on a new principle, which
cannot but greatly facilitate and improve the
work. The area is 40 by 120 feet. The store,
which has several sub-departments, is stocked
with great supplies of iron bedsteads of the newest
patterns, many of the packages being of only
recent arrival. There is a special house for the
storage of feathers, and where the very best deserip
tions are to be found. For some years past Mr.
Lyons’ establishment has been one of the principal
sources of supply of bedding material and
upholstery generally to the large houses of Sydney,
and some of the most important demands in the
upholstery line made by the mail boats and other
steamers have been fulfilled here. Tbp Regent-
street factories, which are under thedirection of a
capable and energetic manager (Mr. Hayes 1 , give
additional facility for work, so that the largest
orders can.here bepromptly executed. The works
at the Bridge-street office were among the first
houses in the city to be connected by teleph one.
Mr. Lyons invites inspection of bis works by the
warehousemen and the furnishing public of
Sydney.
A NEW LAND AGENCY AND STOCK AND
STATION BUSINESS IN SYDNEY.
An announcement has been made in the Sydney
Press, during the last month, of the reconstruction
of a well-known city firm, and the inauguration
by them of a new branch of business. The an-
nouncement has attracted considerable attention,
owing to the well-known energy, experience, and
capability of the individual members of the firm,
Messrs. H. H. Brown and Co., of the Exchange,
Sydney, who have been conducting for some years
a large land agency business, have taken in two
partners, with the view to developments of busi-
ness, the gentlemen being Mr. Nugent Wade
Brown and Mr. C Bruce Lowe. For a considerable
Eeriod, a large stock and station agency business
as been forced on the firm, and now steps have
been taken to give it tee attention which its grow-
ing importance demands. A branch has been
opened in the splendid buildings of Wright,
Heaton, and Co., Pitt-street. The stock and sta-
tion business will have the valuable attention of
Mr. N. W. Brown and Mr. Bruce Lowe, whose ex-
perience in stock matters specially fits them for
the post. The great rising sugar industry of
Queensland and the North coast will be em-
braced in the new arrangments, and this
will have the supervision of Mr. N. W.
Brown, whose twenty years’ experience in
pas; oral and agricultural business in the Nor-
thern colony will render his assistance of the
greatest value to the new fix m. All branches of
the stock and agency business, wool and produce
generally, will be carried on, while the old land
agency business will be conducted at the Ex-
change, as before, by Mr. Holmes and Mr. Ollivier.
With regal'd to the new branches of the business,
auction sales of fat stock will be held twice a
week at Homebush, while sales of dairy cattle,
fat calves, lambs. &c., will be hold at Ellis and Co. s
yards, George-street Bailway Station, and sales of
horses and well-bred dairy cattle at Wooller's
yards, opposite Tattersall’s. Sales of horses will
be regularly held at the Campei'down yai'ds. The
firm has had a well-earned reputation for the
greatest promptitude and fair dealing in con-
nection with the land agency business, Messrs.
Holmes and Ollivier being about the two most
experienced men in he business in Sydney. The
two new partners, Mr. N. W. Brown and Mr. C.
Bruce Lowe, will bring fresh energy into the firm,
and will actively prosecute the business which
each has taken In hand. Mr. H. H. Brown, the
senior member of the firm, will supervise the
whole arrangements, and will personally conduct
the auction sales, whether ot stock or stations, or
of general produce or property. The title of the
newly-constituted firm is Messrs. Brown Brothers
and Co. The old constituents of the firm may
rely on a continuance ot the promptitude of the
past, while new patrons may confidently look tor
the best and fairest representation of their
interests to this one ot the most going business
firms in Sydney.
When Jemmy Service arrived at the Syd-
ney Railway Terminus, to attend the Conference,
he was asked, of course, into a carriage direct for
Government House. He hesitated. Then Sandy
Stuart proposed a cab. He still refused. There-
upon Graham Berry whispered him, “If wo walk
down, we can call in at Mick Simmons’.” Service
gratefully shook Berry by the hand, and said, “ By
the bye, Mick asked me to call; and if I do take a
whiff at his place, I can’t B beat.” At that
moment a tram came up and ran over Graham
Berry, completely destroying its front wheels.
It was two days before Graham could take a
somersault in his bath and cut up a fig of “ Can’t
B Beat ” at the same time in 2J4secs.*
Last month, on the Agricultural Show
Ground Patutahi (N.Z.), “Sir Julius Vogel” be-
coming terribly excited kicked Farmer Jones
behind his right ear, with such force and precision
that he (Jones) deceased 15 minutes afterwards.
[Mem. Sir Julius—no offence—is an entire.] This
reminds us that there was once in N.S.Wales—he
still lives and flourishes—a public official who had
Burke and Debrett at his finger ends. Talk to
him of an earl! He could run his genealogy off
from the time his ancestor came over as drummer
in 1 he army of William the Corn-curer. Venture
a timid remark about a viscount, and he would
quietly put you down with an account of a Ute-a-
tete he had with a royal duke at a meeting of the
Blunderbore hounds in Hertfordshire. If you re-
marked that you once spoke to Prince George of
Cambridge (on the occasion of H.R.H.’s asking
you to pull a rail out of the fence to let his horse
through), B — (that was his name', was ready
with an account of how ’twas to him that Napo-
leon ill. first confided his intention of raising
Eugenie to the throne. Why he came to N.S.W. isn’t
known to this day. When the subject was mooted
he smiled bitterly, but preserved a studied silence.
It was whispered that his advent among us was
due to a reciprocated attachment for one of the
Royal Family—an attachment rendered undesir-
able for grave State reasons. Well, one day a
friend said to B , “ I hear the Marquis of Lans-
downe is coming to N. S. Wales.” “ Egad I
you don’t say so,” was the reply. * Dear, dear
mel Ah! what might have been; what might
have been I Why. he and my father served in the
same regiment. They were sworn comrades. And
his daughter—poor Lady Gwendoline! Ah me!
the evenings I sp<mt under her window with the
tromb that is to say, the light guitar I But why
resurrect the dead past? Better to have loved
and lost than never to have loved at all.” "But
surely the Marquis is no relation of yours ?” “ No
reflation of mine ?” said B sonowfully; “well,
considering that my father and be were cousins;
that they married sisters; and that my maternal
grandmother was first cousin once removed to the
Marquis’ stepfather by a Scotch marriage, but ”
Here nls companion was called away, and B
applied for three weeks’ sick leave when he dis-
covered that the Marquis of Lansdowne was a
prize bull.
REGENT HOUSE.
PAPERHANGINGS, PAINTS, OILS, BRUSHWARE, &c.
It is as well that the trade of the city and the
great mass of the householders resident in the
suburbs, should know that the business of Regent
House in paints, oils, and glaziers’ materials
generally is being as vigorously pushed as in the
palmiest days of its history. When purchased
from the assignees in Mr. George Murphy’s estate
the new proprietors, Messrs. Kean and Co.,
resolved by liberal expenditure of capital to
retain the great popularity of the house, and
even extend its connection. The stock
now embraces the most extensive probably
to be found In any one house in the colony, and
certainly lower figures do not rule anywhere.
The stock comprises an immense quantity of
choice gold, satin, and other paperhangings,
paints of every description in bulk and in small
packages, great quantities of raw and boiled oils,
a small warehouse of plate and other glass, and a
shipment of paperhangings which, for variety
and value, cannot be excelled anywhere. For the
thousands of people who live on the railway line
Regent House has long been a boon, as here are
obtainable, in handy tins, paints of all descrip-
tions ready for use—each packet being accom-
panied by a book of directions of the simplest and
most practical character. These paints, ready for
use, enable a householder to keep his place in
first-class order all the year round on the expendi-
ture of a few shillings. Another article which
has made Recent House famous, not only with the
trade, but with householders and contractors, is
the wood-preserving oil—one of the best inven-
tions, certainly, of the time. This oil has tremen-
dous permeating force, and is certainly a great
preventive of the operations of the white ant,
which has proved so destructive in some of the
best houses in the suburbs. Regent House is
within 200 yards of the Sydney railway terminus,
and both ’bus and tram stop opposite the door; so
that the public have every facility for reaching
what is universally recognised as the best house
in the colonies in the line indicated.
SALE OF THIRTEEN ACRES OF CITY LANDS.
One of the most important sales of land in the
metropolis that has yet been announced, is that
of the Redfern Estate, which is fixed for Monday
next, 7th January, at Messrs. Richardson and
Wrench's Rooms, Pltt-street. The Redfern Estate,
is virtually situated in the city, being only divided
by Elizabeth-street, and comprises 13 acres of
splendid building land. The estate is bounded by
four wide main streets, Castlereagh-street (along
which the trams run), Cleveland-street, Redfern-
street, and Elizabeth-street, Twelve acres of the
land adjoining, being portion of the Mount Lachlan
estate, has been purchased by the Government for
a public park; and this being capital soil, well
watered, a magnificent park, probably the best
in the city, will soon take the place of a grazing-
field. The Redfern Estate for sale has been cut

A correspondent of the Pall. Mall
Gazette, who has been quoted by nearly all the
English and Australian papers, gives the following
recipe for getting thin :—“ Breakfast—A cup of
black tea, white bread (or. better, brown-bread
toast) with abundance of butter, an egg if
required, or a little fat meat, ham. bacon, or fish.
Lunch—A little fat meat, boiled or roasted. After-
noon—A cup of black tea. Dinner-Soup, fish,
fat meat, ham or bacon (no meat without fat),
cabbage, baked fruit (without sugar if desired),
salad, fresh fruit, cheese, and bread and butter. A
half-glass of whisky and water will, at dinner, do
no harm ; a f ew glasses of claret or light wine.
After dinner—Cup of black tea.” “This diet, one
would think ” (says the Australasian) “ought to
fatten.” Barring the suggestion that no meat
should bo without fat, the above recipe tallies
pretty close with Banting’s (or rather Dr. W. Har-
vey’s, Banting’s medical adviser). Fact is, all
‘•geiting-thin” receipts are too thin unless they
deal straight with the “physical idiosyncracy ” (if
such a term is permissible) of the stout individual
to be treated. The only broad lines to go on, in
the way of checking obesity, are these : Avoid
malt liquor, rise early, refrain from suppers,
eschew vegetables in which saccharine constitu-
ents prevail, and nurse a melancholic fad—take,
for Instance, to reading Sladen’s poems, or the
Holt Howl leaders.

ICYCLING EXPERIENCE.
John Rolfes Esq., Champion Bicyclist of England
and Australia, who at present is open to run
a long distance race with any bicyclist for the
championship of the world, gives his Personal
Experience of the Valuable Properties of St.
Jacobs Oil, as used by him in his Recent Contest
with John Watson, for the Championship of
Australia.
268 Elizabeth-street north,
Melbourne, Victoria,
23rd November, 1883.
To the Editor of The Bulletin.
Dear Sir,—I desire to add my cheerful endorse-
ment to the good effects I have at all times
received from the use of St. Jacobs Oil when in
active training and racing. During my recent six
days’ contest, held in the Melbourne Exhibition
Building, for £500 and the championship of the
Australian and adjacent colonies, it was my boon
companion. I continually used it before and
after each day’s performance, and the results
simply astonished me. After riding for eight
consecutive hours each day—viz,, from half-past
2 until half-past 10, my limbs would become sore
and stiff from over-exertion, but after being well
rubbed with the Oil, all muscular pa;n immediately
vanished, and I felt as fresh as ever. As proof
positive, alter the contest was over I rode 100
miles against time before a public audience, and
accomplished it in six hours 11 minutes 45J4
seconds. Another application of St. Jacobs Oil
was made, and it removed all feeling of fatigue,
and I felt perfectly fit for another race. Am
positive it aided me to win the match, and I shall
never enter a similar contest without a bicycle
and St. Jacobs Oil.
I strongly advise all “wheelmen” and other
athletes to give it a trial, and feel fully convinced
their experiences will compare favourably with
my own.
I remain, dear sir, yours truly,
JOHN ROLFE.
WONDERFUL RELIEF.
October 30th, 1883,9 Hunter-street, city.
To the Editor of The Bulletin — Dear sir.—
This is to testify that, having used ST. JACOBS
OlL for a painful affection of the chest. I soon
experienced grateful and permanent relief. Two
applications entirely removed the pain, and I
heartily recommend to any person similarly
afflicted the great German remedy, in the fullest
confidence that it will be equally efficacious.—I
remain, dear sir, yours respectfully. H. Roberts.

Amy Eno, the “ Fruit Salt” man’s daugh-
ter, was married in October to Harold Surthin-
bank, an adjutant in the Hussars. Eno’s gigantic
success is only another proof of the advantages
of advertising when you’ve a good or even decent
article to sell. His so-called fruit-salt is not in any
sense the product of fruit. It consists m< rely of
an alkali or two and an acid or two, and diff ers very
slightly from seidlitz powders and hundreds or
other such preparations.
The S. M. Herald tells us that the word
“obey” has been pretty well blotted out of the
marriage service in America, and that one clever
Murkan parson has tried to get over the trouble
by getting the bride to promise in each case that
she will “ obey in love." Now, in all games “ love ’
means “nix”; erg o, when a woman, a bride (ala
latest American Protestantism), promises in the
marriage service to “obey in love,” all that she
really means is “ I will obey in nothing.” \ es.
Under the new law, in England, a Judge
lately stated that if a husband “sloped” with an
ura breila the bond fide property of his wife, he was
liable to be sent up. Should he take her last new
bonnet, we presume nothing short of the scaffold
would meet the case. For—
If they imprison married fellahs
For annexing umberellahs,
You may take our word upon it
Death will hang to the new bonnet.
A New York lady says of Mrs. Langtry :—
«* Whatever her merits may bo otherwise, she is a
marvel of style and good taste. Her hair Is a
revelation to American women, who have so long
sought beauty by false fronts and dirty, fuzzy- i
looking frizzes. Mrs. Langtry’s hair is a dark,
glossy brown, worn in a neatly-braided coil, shinv
as satin. It is the cleanest and handsomest head
of hair I ever saw, and she never spoils it with an
ornament. 1 f she has set the American women to
baying English brushes and using them, she has
done a good work, and we can afford to forgive
her for Freddie.” This is a jar for the small-footed
fair ones who wear two-dollar bangs in the land of
the free.
The latest Paris fashion among ladies of
advanced ideas is to wear socks, as being more
cool than the stockings affected by Mrs. Grundy.
Should this craze gain ground, the price of elastic
goods will materially diminish: but muddy cross-
ings will require to be carefully avoided by the
fair sex. The bare idea of a lady raising her dress
a little above the boots will be too dreadful tor
contemplation : —
THE LATEST.
This modern style of wearing socks
Must needs demand much lengthened frocks,
For should the balmv breezes blow
(As now and then they do, you know),
’Twould be indeed, just quite too shocking
To see a leg uncased in stocking.
[Certainly.— Ed. B]
Colonel Mapleson, who engaged Patti for
America, arranged a magnificent reception, which,
however, had a comic ending. Determined to do
the big thing, he hired a fine steamer, with a brass
band, and crowded it with big people. He further
engaged no less than thirteen smaller steamers,
all decked with bunting, which were to steam out
in procession, and toot their little whistles as Patti
came up the bay They all waited. Hour after
hour went tediously by, as the Colonel, the brass
band, the friends, and the thirteen steamers, waited
for Patti to come. Everybody got sleepy aud
cross: the reception committee glared fiercely:
the friends were fatigued, and the brass band
drunk in a beer saloon. At last the Colonel, in a
white heat, took a cab, and driving at breakneck
speed to the office on Broadway, learned that the
Hallie had gone to another pier, and that Patti,
finding her way to a hotel, had been calmly sleeping
for more than six hours, in total oblivion of him-
self and reception, the friends, the brass band,
and the thirteen steamers.
One of Mary Anderson’s first stage lessons
was from the veteran actor, Vandcnhof. She was
very poor then, but entirely determined towards
the stage, and at first he tried to dissuade her by
demanding £10 for ten lessons, paid in advance.
But, a week or two afterwards she came to him,
and said simply : “ With many sacrifices I have
raised the money, and now please I want to
begin.” So she recited a piece; and he gruffiy
advised her to go back home and try some other
way of earning a living. “I thought you said
your terms were £10 in advance for teaching,” she
said. And he taught her, for her pluck. Miss
Anderson has always been rather what is called
“ cheeky.” On the stage she was easily a queen ;
off, she was nothing but a wild girl, who rolled
her handkerchief over her finger, and shifted
restlessly from o"o chair to another till she had
circumnavigated the whole room. She was frank,
though—honest—no snob—perfectly at her ease
with any one. One evening, wjen Longfellow
was complimenting her acting, she suddenly broke
jn with tneodd remark : “ But won’t you give me
a copy of your poems, wmh your name written
jn ?” And while her mother, who was in the box,
frowned at such a forward request, Longfellow
replied > “ Of course I will,” and did.

“ Clara Belle,” who contributes the
“Social Column” to that chronicler of small
beer and big pumpkins, the Maitland Mercury,
endorses the remark made by a girl amateur
performer in some local school theatricals that
“ new laid eggs and plenty of confidence will work
wonders.” Clara possibly knows all about it, but
we deprecate her endeavours to lower the tone of
an ultra-moral journal Into that of a Holywell-
street “scrofulosity.” — It seems that Luther's
wife was a handsome woman, and that the saint
“cut another fellow out” in her affections.
Writing to his rival, a young doctor, ho naively
«ays, “ If you are anxious to have your Kitha,
pome hpre at once, or she will become the property
of another. You have a prior title to her.”. ..
The latest and raciest new rdav bears the sugges-
tive title, “Land Me Your Wile.'’ A penniless and

rows his friend’s wife to show as a substitute.

DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
The Rev. A. Hardie, who used to moderate
at the Assembly for a while, was sent over
to declare the pulpit of the Scots’ Church
vacant. Everyone Knew it was vacant, but that
was no matter. The formal announcement bad
to be made, and the congregation invited to “ call”
a substitute for their old darling heretic. The
exhorter reminded them of the fact that Christ
was the head of their system; and lest they might
not appreciate the impalpable presence at its full
value, he showed how essential Government was
in the political affairs of the country. It must be
gratifying to the Soots’ Cnurch people to know
that Christ’s relation to their system is analagous
to Berry’s when a stock-tax is laid upon the
country.
The Liberal Club at Plymouth (England)
js managed on principles which are far too
goody-goody to meet the requirements of two
High Church clergymen of the town, so these
gentlemen, as members of the Club, have given
notice of motion to rescind a rule which prohibits
cards and billiards on Sunday, as being contrary to
the spirit of liberalism. As we are also told of
another clerical magnate at Plymouth who sanc-
tions Sunday card-playing at the Working Men's
Institute in connection with his church, we cer-
tainly recommend the prompt despatch of the
Melbourne Presbytery to this English, seaport
town. There they could bo supplied with the
little Sunday dissipations which such severely
religious individuals are always so capable of
enjoying.
Tbe Melbourne War Cry, though always
possessing literary merit of a very high class, has
not hitherto been remarkable for a strict atten-
tion to veracity. The thrilling “dispatches ” of
certain officers have, as a matter of fact, been
rather highly coloured, but the following extract
from a recent one displays a conscientiousness
greatly to be commended: “ Last Honday we had
the joy of pointing six dear souls to heaven, and
they professed to accept salvation.” Now, as
those “six dear souls” were knocking about
in Little Bourke-street, Melbourne, it was just as
well to introduce the word “professed” as a
“saving” clause, for the denizens ot that un-
savoury quarter have been known to break their
word before now. They are Chinamen mostly,
and Chinamen require a lot of “ pointing.”
In considering some claims put forward
on behalf of having the Chinese entered up as
believers in God, the Argus implies that it would
be better worth the Celestial’s while to aim at
truth and faithfulness in his dealings than at
getting himself returned on the census-paper as a
Heist. We think so. But what about getting on
the census-paper as of a C.E. or K.C. denomina-
tion? Is it only the Chinaman who must graduate
to Deism through the severe ethics of truth and
faithfulness in daily pursuits? Or is it that the
cabalism of C.E. or R..C. means still less thau the
point of John’s vague ambition ? If truth and
faithfulness in daily pursuits be insisted upon in
this country before a man can enter himself up
as a member of a great religious party, the
Government statist will have to indicate the re-
ligious progress of the people by a blank sheet.
As everyone knows, the Rev. Charles
Strong’s application for a certificate, through the
somewhat unholy medium of his solicitors (Messrs.
Malloson, England, and Stewart), was discussed at
a private meeting of the Presbytery, *ind the
result of their deliberations was the announce-
ment that they “never entertained an application
for a certificate, except upon the direct request of
the person interested.” Solicitors’ requests are
under many circumstances regarded as being
quite too painlully direct, but in ttiis case perhaps
the Presbytery may lose nothing by their quibble.
The “modern Luther” is evidently up to a thing
or two. Poor Martin wasn’t able to employ
solicitors, was he? The statement that the Pres-
bytery intends to forward a beautifully engrossed
certificate to the “ dear departed,” as a New Year’s
gift, is pretty in conception, but unsubstantial in
fact; magnanimity ig not one of the Presbytery’s
failings.
*♦ Let brotherly love continue ”
Is a precept you ministers quote j
Yot it doesn’t appear to be in you.
As soon as ’tis put to the vote,
The hatchet of discard to bury
And to grant brother Strong his certlf.
So your brotherly lore seemeth very
Much like being purely a myth.
Everyone knows that Mr. James Smith is
a bit of a theologian. His principal pulpit is that
great success, the Victorian Review. Month
after month, James harangues the half-dozen
people who read that “ credit to Australian litera-
ture,” and sometimes he gets into queer corners
of spiritual excitement. In a recent exploration,
he found that some people have souls and some
haven’t, just as some people have warts on the
nose and some haven’t. Of all people in the
world, an amateur theologian is the funniest
when be tries to be serious. But the fun is added
to when a parson proceeds to demolish the ama-
teur. That was attempted the other Sunday in St.
Paul's Pro-Cathedral. The Rev. Peter Campbell
and Thomas Walker have their counterparts in
the Rev. Mr. Byng and James Smith. Everybody
laughs, and no one believes a word they say on the
great themes.
Moody, the Evangelist, is attracting large
audiences to his Temple at the North of London—
as many as 9000 in one day. Moody s present rng-
lish tour will be of six months’ duration: «rd M?
committee estimate the total expenses at £14 COO,
which amount they will find little difficulty in rais-
ing—for the sum asked is moderate in comparison
with that expended over the first “mission,” when
four months only of “ hot-zospelling ” swallowed
up nearly £30,000; making it appear as though the
promoters of the 1875 venture were certainly
nothing out of pocket by their good work. It may
be that Moody's campaign will deal a death-blow
at the Salvation Army in London. General Booth,
at any rate, is finding business rather slack since
the advent of his American rival, and a falling off
In home funds is very likelv to hasten the “ Gene-
ral’s ” projected visit to Australia. Moody’e ser-
vices are devoid of most of the claptrap features
of the “ Harmy’s,” the strongest point, of resem-
blance between them being “the standing up of
such as are saved.” But though the “Commercial
Traveller for the Kingdom of Heaven ” (as Moody
has been called) takes a very largo number of
orders, we fear that, in too many cases, his cus-
tomers refuse the goods when they are delivered.

Chairman of the Bench by whom Rev. Mr. Ullman
was fined under the borough by-laws for obstruct-
ing the streets by collecting and addressing a
crowd of 100 persons, said, in announcing the de-
cision of the Court: “I have a most unpleasant
duty to perform. We have no option, under the
Borough by-laws. I have no doubt of the zeal of
the defendant, though I don't agree with the
manner he has adopted of showing it. The Bench
will inflict the mitigated penalty of 10s. tine and

it myself, to show that I sympathise with the
spirit I believe Mr. Ullmnn to be actuated by.”.. .

In America they combine the church and

Those who live by the law break it occa-
sionally. Down South, two solicitors were seconds
for a merchant and a boss-drover, who, instead of
wasting money in fees, went back to the primitive
way of settling a little difficulty—” on the green.”
There was a Jady in the case. Strange it things

With the dread, distant din of the sorrowful seas,

For I think as I list to the ocean
How each drop is a dole of that one mighty whole,
And the whole makes me sick with its motion.
The very latest humorous sheet to ha - d
comes from Melbourne. It is entitled “The
Luther Celebration,” and in it all Roman Catholics
are implored to regard the 10th of November as a
great day of Intercession and expiation “for our
erring brethren, the Protestants, as their religions
condition deserves sincere compassion.” This is
rough on the editor of the Howl and Pastor Allen,
who surely don’t want compassion from the Avomau
who sits on the scarlet beast at Rome.
The Mayor of Dover (Eng.) has declined (o
pay for the luncheon ordered by the officers of tho
Town Council upon election day, and for which
previous mayors have, according to rule, bee-i
responsible. So the caterer has come down on the
unfortunate councillor who selected the menu.
Upon expostulating with the Mayor on his nig-
gardliness, that most worshipful gentleman stated:
“ When I took office I said I would carry out the
duties of the office only ” The Mayor’s reply has
put quite a new complexion upon municipal life.
Hitherto we have thought that a Mayor’s Arst and
foremost duty was to provide feeds for his plump
brethren.
A few days ago a huugry-looking woman
was hauled up before Stipendiary Dillon, and her
mtrepid arrester having kissed old Deuteronomy
as lovingly as if it was his own Jemima Ann just
seating him down to supper, deposed that “ Frum
irfurmashin resaived I surrounded th’ rrish’nur,
and caught hir in th’ act av perambylatin’ fra in
house t’ house surlistin’ Chrishrais barxes.” Then
Dillon, looking down as lovingly as an old crow on
a dead horse, observed: “Woman—go lbyway.
You have done no more than the Sydney postmen
do.” Then the sinner Aled out, slowly elghlng,
and said : “ Musha now, luk at that—an r th’ purty

“Parliament,” says E. L. Zox, of Mel-
bourne, “is never more respected than when it Is
in recess.” We admit that this saying is good. But
we believe it is a lie. We have often wished Par-
liament to sit in endless session, so as to use up all
the blather of members who, il they haven’t the
ear of the House, go junketDg round the coun-
try. and responding for Parliament at every
gathering from a cockfight to the opening of a
Free Library. Parliament on the commands
a far more pronounced contempt, from thought-
ful citizens, than Parliament in session. Thought-
ful citizens can keep away from Parliament in
session, but nothing »hort of a blunderbuss can
save them from Parliament on the loose.
A shocking case of arrested development
in salvation has occurred at Prahran (Melb.).
John Ryan (whoso sp;ritual cognomen, by the bye,
is “Tipperary Jack”) was a “ full corporal” in the
Prahran Harmy ; but in the very moment of
marching a detachment into barracks, John’s
military career was cut short by a warrant. Nine-
teen previous convictions were proved against
John, which, for a man of his strong religious
opinions, certainly appears a good many. When
the “corporal” was asked if he had anything to
say, he smiled a beatific smile upon the magis-
trate, and " placed trust in the Lord.” And when
ho was sentenced to one little month, he expressed
his intention of doing that bit on his head “ for
’s sake.”
We’re afraid the American capital must
be a rather naughty place, when a lady writes
thus about its top societyI con (ess I was un-
prepared to see so much in Washington drawing-
rooms. Frequently, at hops and receptions, 1 saw
handsome girls at the age w hen they are assumed
to be most modest appearing in almost a nude
condition above the waist. 1 wondered whether
these girls had mothers, and whether the mothers
were aware of the condition in which their daugh-
ters were exposi ng their charms. At tho Jast imp
a young naval officer, who was introduced to and
waltzed with one of the semi-nude young ladies,
was asked by a friend how he enjoyed the waltz.
His replv was: ‘Well, the fact is, Miss Plantu-
genet’s dress was cut so infernally low, that I didn’t
iftink of the waltz at all.’ ”
Up Mary boroijgh (Q.) way there is a Chi-
nese named Thomas Ashney. It is 23 years since
he took the oath of naturalisation, and married an
English wife. Since then he has got rich, speaks
English as well as Quong Tart, is held in good re-
pute, and was once Mayor of Gayndah. A few
weeks ago he took his nephew, whose mother was
an Englishwoman, to Sydney on a visit, and, on
h ! s return, the Brisbane authorities telegraphed
that tho poll-tax of £10 should bo dt manded both
for him and his young relative, who was born in
Gayndah. He paid for himself, and squeezed his
nephew through at half-price on account of being
a half-caste. So all the prate about enlightenment
civilisation, Christianity, d hoc genus, etc , simply
amounts to this—that, if the Chinese had a couple
of millions of disciplined cut-throats to fall back
upon, and were able to exclude Europeans, and
command their own seas, Thomas Ashney would
not have to pay a poll-tax. In fact, civilisation
has come to mean the art of manufacturing ex-
plosive bullets, and using them.
“Maid, Wif«, and Mother” is the title of
a pamphlet of 64 papes, lately published In Sydney,
and containing quite a number of sensible sug-
gestions and directions for the guidance of women
under various circumstances. Those directions
are conveyed in a plain, chatty style, free from
the technicalities which render professional works
on the subject of little value to non-professional
readers.

WHAT CAN ONE GET THAT’S WORTH
GIVING AS A CHRISTMAS GIF I',
WITHOUT EXTRAVAGANT OUTLAY?
The above is a question which a million people
will be asking themselvex this season. One wants
to show affection and good-wiil by a handsome
and appropriate gift, which will be tasteful and
useful. It is the most puzzling and tiresome job
10 find anything wnlch answers these require-
ments, and is yet obtainable at a reasonable price.
The Oriental Gold Company
(Only Australian place of business, 474 George-
strect, opposite the Central Entrance to the
Markets),
has solved this problem of the season, and pro-
vides EXQUISITE GIFTS from 5s. to JE5:
Articles of dainty design and enduring beauty,
which will give delight at the first glance, and
will last a lifetime
ORIENTAL GOLD is the very latest discovery
of the alchemitfs laboratory. Tnero have been
good ana useful imitations of sterling gold before
it; but all have been thrown into the shade by
this triumph of modern science. Articles of
i 'rien*al Gold cannot, after years of wear, be dis-
tinguished irom the costliest wares of the gold-
smith. So noble is this metal, that no tawdry
goods of old and inferior designs are manufac-
tured of it. The discoverers have not condescended
to apply it to base uses.
THE VERY LATEST DESIGNS IN JEWELLERY
AND BIJOUTERIE
are regularly worked up in Oriental Gold simul-
taneously with their production in sterling metal,
and, placed side by side, the one article cannot be
told from tho other.
THE PRICE OP ARTICLES OF ORIENTAL
GOLD IS BUT A TRIFLE
when compared with Identical models of sterling
metal.
Some of the goods are mounted with the NEW
DIAMONDS, another masterpiecd of the chemists
of the nineteenth century—artificial stones which
equal the noblest brilliants in fire and glitter, and
rival them in hardness.
The Arrist-designers of Paris have, with eager
appreciation, adopted Oriental Gold as worthy to
receive their happiest conceptions. The most
graceful Parisian models are impressed upon a
portion of our stock, which is replenished with
novelties by every mail.
CALL AND INSPECT-EXACTLY OPPOSITE

friend to do so. Visitors are always made welcome,
and not pestered to buy, because we know that no
one has ever yet viewed our goods without being

SOCIAL.
Lovely weather enticed a large crowd to
Randwick on Boxing Day, including the Earl, the
Mayor, some of the Ministry, and any number of
prominent men and women. The toilet show was
merely fair, nothing more. The majority of gay
dressers congregated in the members’ half of the
stand. Among those who promenaded, there
were few specialities visible. White would have
been first favourite in the colours, only for the
fact that it isn't a colour. Even among the horses,
too, Waite’s were decidedly popular. For ageneral
aspect of summer/ grace, the ">08t noticeable
lady, we think, was the fair and slender wearer of
a white lawn dress, so airy and light that over a
coloured foundation which glinted through, it had
the delicate hue of medusa-green, A brightgreen
waist-sash was worn, and a sunflower at the belt.
Seasonable was a nicely-made China silk, lace and
gloves to match, and gold jewellery. A dainty
figure wa s garbed in a well-fltted crushed straw-
berry corded silk, and broehe front skirt hung
with pompons. An elderly lady wore a lovely
heliotrope b r oche; and rich was a heavy ottoman
cord, with pattern in green and brown; the skirt
was of shot colours, brown hiving the best of It,
pompon trimmings. Stylish was a black ottoman
with raised velvet flowers on it, still enough to
nearly stand alone; and the black parasol had a
heavy edging of black ostrich feathers. Just as
stylish, too, was a black gros-grain, vandyked
bodice edged with black bead fringe, pompons on
top of shoulders, black knotted cor 'sand pompons
at,the back. A silk was of bluish tint and yellow
shot together and trimmed with blue diced velvet.
The silk was draped across the right side, and
the skirt was the diced velvet alternating with
long, narrow pleats of the silk. A cream India
muslin, with three tucked flounces, worn by a
nice brunette, was livened with a ruby zone and
nock-bow; and a grey check with a hint of purple,
the skirt circled with black velvet linos, was worn
by a Western young lady who must have been in
the front rank when Nature was dealing beauty
out. Cate-au-lait was tha colour of a brown cash-
mere, hung with beads to match, broehe front. A
pearl grey satin and broehe was worthy of admira-
tion; and a watered moire of bright chaudron
sure to catch the eye when it moved, There were
many of the crook-handled parasols, and one lady’s
had an immense rose on the handle. A piquant
blonde was pleasing in satin body of royal blue,
and bows of same on the skirt, which was of light
striped blue in large box pleats niched at the
bottom; hat turned up with blue, Under a ficelle
lace parasol, gleamed a sumptuous and stately
costume—redingote of dark green satin, the ski t
of blush pink all fronted with gigantic purple
pansies. From the same part of town came a
young Hebrew lady, musical, in white lawn with
broad embroidered flounces, and cardinal sash. A
pair of charming dresses were of silky texture-
one of mashed strawberry, the other of corn-
flower blue, both trimmed with smoky lace in the
same stylo. And a vision of white was a very
bouffant lawn, made in five tucked flounces, with
tucked shoulder capo, leather-coloured gloves and
belt, all under a perfectly plain white satin sun-
shade. Most ladies wore silk ulsters on the road,
j i case of dust.
» * ♦
On 31st Dec., the annual ball given by
Messrs. P. H. Neels and Sons took place at Nitha-
tlalc. In the decorations, only green leafage was
used, which left the monopoly of colour to the
dresses of the ladies, who took full advantage of
t neir privilege—they always do. Among the cha-
racters, a liandwick blonde as Daughter of the
Itegimeutv in cardinal and black, divided notice
with a Night costume, of black grenadine and
silvcr'stHrs, as most conspicuous. Two young
Tyrolese Feasants were in correct and picturesque
garb, bady Campbell, in blue satin, black velvet,
and white wig, was as pretty as usual. One novel
fancy idea was a navy blue dress, covered with
beetles. These beetles attracted a great deal of
attention, a oelicious evening dress was worn by
a Waverley Hoad lady, of delicate pink satin, hung
with grass and water-lilies. The fair daughter of
a Fitt-stroet auctioneer wore pink tulle skirt and
black bodice, and hair all in a File on top. A pink
satin, very full and long at the back, with rows of
black lace across the skirt, was peculiarly stylish.
A pure white dress of flowered silk was one of the
prettiest; and black satin with pink lace, on a
William-street brunette with midnight eyes, was in
perfect taste. Bunthorne was capital; two York-
street sisters, blondes, in cream, almost irresistible.
A Wagga lady was charming in white satin, and
strings of pearl in the hair. Three favourite
sisters from Bourke-street had their programmes
soon requested ; one wore blue satin, and two
white, with trimmings respectively of blue and
crushed strawoorry. A pair of white veiling
dresses, worn by sister brunettes, deserved lots of
admiration for their pretty coloured crewelling.
A white linen dress with tucked flounces and
maroon sash was worn by a tall and handsome
girl who wore bands of ivy leaves flat upon the
head. From Woollahra, a fair blonde and beauti-
ful dancer came all in blue ; and it is hardly
needful to say that the daughter of the house
danced in a stylo that is pretty well peerless.
Those who did not care for exertion adjourned to
cards and clouds in the smoke-room upstairs, or to
uuiet nooks where there wore no stares, or fre-
quented the supper-room, where they showed a
good deal of taste. During the night, Mr. E.
Needs danced a hornpipe, and Mr. W. Needs, an
Irish jig, in full costume. The ball ended soon
after 3 o’clock, and was quite as agreeable as the
thermometer permitted.
f *
Madame Charbonnet-Kellernaanu’s invita-
tions to the musical matinie given by herself and
miDils resulted in a fud Protestant Hall on Satur-
day afternoon. 31st December. Most of the
audience wore ladies, and the building seemed all
a flutter with rustling fans. Pupils, in white or
cream, occupied a sacred square in front. Many
musicians were present, the majority ot listeners
being critical. When the numbers were concluded,
urizes were presented by Sir Patrick Jennings, who
made a pithy little speech on the advantages of
popularising the best music, and raising tha stan-
dnrdof taste, as Madame Kellermann had done.
The chief honours in class fell to (the wearer of
last year’s silver medal) Miss Edith Brown, of
Clytha, who won the gold medal for piano, and
silver one for theory; and as Sir Patrick pinned
them on, with a few complimentary words, the
young lady was heartily applauded. The silver
medal for piano (also second prize for theory) went
to Miss Bose Samper: and the bronze one to Miss
Minnie Graves. The next prizes fell to Misses
Nellie Mooney, Mabel leely, Adelia Curran
Private pupils: 1st prize, Mdllo. Marie Gouet; 2nd
prize. Miss Ethel Shepherd Smith, Junior prize.
Mi-s BDnch Montagu, who played very well. A
number of certificates were given, that for reading
at sight being gained by Miss Bella Levey. The
last act was the presentation to Mdme. Kellermann
on behalf of her pupils of a valuable bronze and
ormolu clock of handsome design.

There was an interesting marriage at
Hawaii recently. It was that of a popular and
wealthy Mani belle, Miss Ruth Aea, to
Mr. Thomas Auchterlonio, a staff writer on the
Saturday Press. The bridesmaids were native
girls. The ceremony was performed by one of the
bride’s brothers, Mr. B. Aea, and breakfast given
to a party at the house of another brother. The
bridegroom is eldest son of Mrs. D. Auohterlonie,
of Field of Mars, near Parramatta, and was for
several years a compositor in the Mercury office.

They are a little primitive still in the Far
North. A band of Palmerston bachelors, who
laboured under so many social obligations as to be
unable to rub them off any other way, hired the
Town Hall, and gave a ball. Of course, the North-
ern belles didn’t require asking twice, and, what’s
more, they willingly provided music, As the wind
blew out many of the lights, it is easy to believe
the night was reasonably cool; and notwithstand-
ing that, outside promenading was rendered risky
by scraps of old iron hoops, broken bottles, and
decayed boots, the ball was a boom. And the fact
that it was deemed unnecessary to make the usual
intimation—“ wheelbarrows may be ordered for
3 a.m.”—shows that the tone of Palmerston society
is improving.
• • •
A reunion of a very pleasant character
took place at Bethany House, Bondi, on Boxing
Bay. The occasion was the anniversary of the
arrival, 50 years ago, in N.S.W., of Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Dickson, sen., both of whmn are over 84
years of age, and who, with their numerous off-
spring, have been residents of Bondi for over a
quarter of a century. There wee over 70 guests,
of whom 41 were descendants—consisting of chil-
dren, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.
The time was passed in various forms-such as
croquet, cricket, &c.,—and a very pleasant feature
of the day’s pleasure consisted in the photograph-
ing of the whole party in a group by Mr. D. Scott,
of Stanmore. About 3 o’clock the comi-any sat
down to a first-class spread, which the fresh sea
air enabled them to do justice to. After tea,
served A la Ruwe, and some music and part sing-
ing by a few of the members of the Metropolitan
Liedertafel who were present, one of the most
pleasant of garden parties came to an end, as do
all things mundane.

On Boxing Day, a large number of ladies
and gentlemen enjoyed a trip round the harbour,
in the new steamer, Warrego, of the Queensland
Steamship Co. Guests were received at the gang-
way, and they included many politicians, judges,
lawyers, doctors, journalists, and public men, the
mercantile marine being especially represented.
At Watson’s Bay, a fine Compagnoni luncheon was
attacked, and subsequently speeches were made in
the cabin. Mr. J. M. Macrossan, M.L.A., as a
Queenslander, was called on to propose the toast
of the Queensland Steamship Co., coupled with
the names of Messrs. Burns and M’llwraith, and
Capt. Phillips, who each responded. Toasts of the
Ladies and the Press followed. The Carraciolo
baud provided music during the afternoon, and all
lauded at the Circular Quay soon after five
o’clock.
• • •
On Friday, 31st Dec., a very successful
dinner was given at Fernleigh, Hose Bay, by Mr.
Chris. Bonnet, to wish bon voyayc to Mr. J. Hen-
niker Heaton, who departs for Europe
within the next day or two. Amongst the
company wore Sir John Robertson, Sir Patrick
Jennings, the Rev. T. Kemmis, M.A., the Hon. the
Postmaster-General, Mr. C. E. Cracknell; the
Sheriff, Mr. C. Cowper; and Mr. Alfred Bennett.
• • •
A few days ago, a number of guests met
by invitation of Mr. and Mrs. Barber, of Coora-
digbee Station, near Bookham, to celebrate by a
party their eldest daughter’s 31st birthday. As
such opportunities do not occur every day. the
young people of the district “wired in.” Many
pretty dresses were seen; the hostess wearing blaca
silk and cardinal. A brown-tressed girl was charm-
ing in cream and blue with a wreath of forget-me-
nots; and her younger sisters were in pink and
cream. A young and vivacious widow was pretty
in blue and cream; a brunette from a neighbour-
station sweet in white and pink. Cream with loops
of crushed strawberry made a Bowning maid win-
some, and a governess sparkled in pink and white
lace. All the guests were highly pleased, and
danced till the stars were relieved from their sen-
tinel watch in the sky.
• ■ •
Somehow the audience was cold at the
sixth social evening of the Sydney Liedertafel,
and tt was not through lack of merit in the music,
either. There was, however, a little disappoint-
ment at no lady vocalist appearing. In part songs,
Genre’s “Musical Jest” was perhaps best. The
vocal quartet, “ Rest, dearest,” was a gem, the low
bass having a splendid voice. Mr. Knight Aston
sang three solos, ani was disappointing in each.
Herr Vogrieh, as the new conductor, was suc-
cessful, and deservedly so. Mr. Charles Huener-
bein was accompanist, and there is no better.
Nearly everybody dresses well at the Liedertafel
socials, but it is impossible mention a fourth of
those who deserve description, A pretty plump
girl, with white skin and short black hair, wore a
black grenadine, cut low, and with very short
sleeves, with charming effect. Another black
dress was of silk and rich broehe, cut square, and
filled in with white tulle, elbow sleeves, edged with
tulle and tiny bunches of wild flowers. A bright
amber satin, trimmed with black was, at any rate,
striking, A pale blue nun’s veiling and silver
flowers: a crimson satin and cream trimmings; a
cream skirt, with beautiful pale blue plush redin-
gote, pearl ornaments, were all pretty; and two
sisters in soft white dresses, gold belts, and gloves
to match, were exceedingly so. A sweet, fair
blonde looked like a princess in a dress composed
entirely of lace, skirt flounced right up to the
waist, sleeves of same. No colour was worn with
this, and the effect was excellent, and quite out of
the common. A young lady with a wealth of
beautiful auburn hair showed taste in her choice
of colour-the very palest sea-green, in what
appeared to be fine cashmere, flounced to the
waist, with loose half sleeves, set off with soft
white lace. White dresses were numerous.

As a sequel to the breaking up of the
Modern High School, its Athletic Club gave a
nice concert and hall. Tattersall’s hall was deco-
rated, and nearly full. Of the 16 musical pieces,
th« overture, Auber’s “Domino Noir,” was capital,
as were also “ Te L’Rammenta,” a duet by Miss
Ponder and Mrs. Lewis, “ Vashi,” by the latter,
and “ The Wreath” trio by the two ladies and Mr.
Levison. Mdme. Garuhaf sang “ Dream Faces”
swt etly; there was a quartette by English concer-
tina players; Messrs. M’Mahon with cornet and
Summer at the piano were excellent, and Mr.
Harvey played a waltz on six instruments simul-
taneously—the piano, cornet, beds, triangle, cym-
bals, and drum. About 10 o’clock dancing began
on an original plan, every dance alterna ing with
a song or recitation, which was arranged with a
view to coolness. Supper was provided in the
large off-room, and the whole affair was supervised
by r Mr. Weiss, who spared no trouble to make
guests comfortable. A few fancy dresses were
worn, and some pretty evening toilets. Miss
Burvett was charmingly airy in white. A Rand-
wick favourite was 'hiinty in pink veiling; a Red-
fern young lady had the richest dress, of brilliant
ruby plush top and rich cream skirt; a lady from
Paddington combined a black skirt with rich bur-
gundy’ velvet bodice, and her daughter wore white
and gold. From Wynyard-square was a pretty
blonde in pink and scarlet flowers. As the floor
and music were both good, the ball was an ex-
ceedingly agreeable one.
* ♦ »
About a fortnight ago, the first grand
public ball was held in Noumea, in the new hall,
It had a canvas roof, and one side entirely open to
the garden, which, with a cloudless, stirless night
and full golden moon and fountain playing, made
a delightful scene. The attendance was large, in-
cluding the Governor and English vice-consul,
and many really beautiful dresses were displayed.
There was a splendid bund for the music, which
was perfect for dancing. The ball took place on
Saturday night, and the last guests went home
under the blazing sun of a summer Sunday morn-
ing, at 6 o clock.
• • •
New Year’s Day saw even a larger crowd
at liandwick than the week before—more ladies,
and more show. Many wore military collars, and
almost all came garbed in ulsters of all sorts. Just
as well, lor the dust, when homing, was bad. The
Tattersall’s Club Cup, shown on the stand, was as
handsome as cups are made. We may call it gold
trimmed with silver, on a marble base; the handles
were horses’ heads on each side, the top displaying
the Southern Cross, with silver stais on a gold
sheld, surmounted by crossed whips and jockey
cap, and supported by two silv er saddles. White
and cream toilets bore the sway. Miss Young
wore a white, with real flowers, and a scarlet belt
embroidered in gold beads; Mrs. Roberts, a rich
light violet satin in broad pleats, and pompadour
bodice to match. A dark green silk, with large
white lace collarette, had fern pattern broch<5 skirt.
A fine figure was very noticeable all in white,
the body brocWd, skirt flounced with lace edges,
and white parasol with colourless sunflowers
worked on it. A married lady wore very rich
heliotrope corded silk, with bows thereon of
darkest violet, of which colour satin the bodice
was—the hues blending tastefully. A pearl satin
with a flowered pattern was admirable. An all
white lawn had gold belt, golden straw hat loaded
with golden buttercups. A dark grass green satin
was edged with thick chenille fringe, bunched
behind and ridged on the shoulders, with bright
verdant oak-leaves round the bonnet. A charming
girl sported heliotrope silk, and over it a tailed
bodice of flowered pattern to match, trimming of
pure white lace, and fascinating poke hat. With
Mr. Darrell came a lady in a greeny-blue tartan
zephyr, under a blue flowered parasol; and Miss
Pender wore a long black cashmere tunic trimmed
with beads, over a skirt of fawn veiling with
narrow black lines. Mrs. Michael Kidston, of Mel-
bourne, graced a handsome costume of lilac bro-
cade and lace, bonnet of pearl net and lilac fea-
thers, cream satin parasol. From Elizabeth-etreet
was a pretty blonde, in the neatest of black
velvet jackets, and underneath a skirt of
cream veiling. Mrs. Ackman wore a delicious
cream ; and a companion Hebrew lady one of the
most elegant drosses on the ground, a lovely doye-
coloured cashraore, corded at back, and lined with
plush pink, Henry II. hat, exactly matching In
hue. Lots of whites were faultless ; and lots of
silver insects were visible —beetles for brooches,
spiders impaled with pins, shining crabs, and
jewel-winged butterflies. Miss Kurtz wore a con-
spicuous dress of dark red satin, chemisette front,
brilliantly crowelled, and strawberry-speckled
Henry II. hat to correspond. Mrs. Coleman, from
Wagga, displayed a very rich dark brown satin,
and pompadour top, which looked well: and her
auburn sister tried pale blue. Mrs. Hart wore a
handsome light cornflower-blue silk body and
back draping, while tue skirt was of a faint blue,
flowered, and richly trimmed with rows of white
lace. The daintiest little fairy was a maid of
sweet twelve, in sailor costume of pure white
flannel, apparently without underskirts, dark
blue collarette and stockings, and sailor hat.
un a very young lady, the style was
exceedingly tasteful. A lichen green satin
and ottoman broehe, decked with chenille
to match, was attractive on a blonde lady.
Several black satins, black ottoman broches,
corded silks, etc., were rich and handsome, though
not requiring description. A simple, tastelul
toilet was light blue zephyr skirt, and black redin-
gote corded behind, of faultless shape, and chemi-
sette front. A blue satin and broehe, under a
golden poke bonnet and white lace parasol, was
also very noticeable. But many thought the
sweetest construction on the lawn was a silk and
broehe, hung with fringe and pompons, of a
peculiar pink, nearly indescribable, which was
worn also on Boxing Day, and was the acme of
neatness.

There is no more popular band in Sydney
than the Young Australian. On Christmas Day,
the band, under Mr. J. R. Hardy, gave a free and
most enjoyable concert in the Botanic Gardens.
Programmes, on prettily-printed Christmas cards
with gold lettering, contained a fine selection of
sacred and secular music... Lovely woman’s last
outbreak is to have “bangs” on the back of
her neck On the 20th December Mrs.
Hughes, of Lotaville School, Darlinghurst,
gave her annual party. In the afternoon, presen-
tation of prizes took place, and dancing followed
in the evening till the fairies’ mystic hour.... Miss
Holmes’s breaking-up fete, at Charlton House,
Paddington, was opened by the German Band,
who, later on, played for the dancers. The con-
cert was good, and pupils’ proficiency was also
exhibited in French and English recitations, fancy
work, &c Short hair is prevalent. To some, it
is becoming. When bunched on top of the head,
it is correct to use a large golden hairpin. Some
use steel, pearl, or silver buckles, but this hair-
pin is the very latest..,.A pleasant plain and
fancy ball took place at the residence of Mr.
Bayley, Queen-street, Woollahra, on Boxing
©veiling*, «nd was kept up till 3 a.m. With capital
music and catering, and good dancers, all went
smoothly as a top. Two sisters were in deep
cream, and in black and cardinal, one carrying
the palm of the evening. A trio of the same
name wore blue silk and pearls ; deep pink silk
and cardinal streamers ; and a combination ot
blue and old gold silk—and looked dainty The
pretty Zoo Gardens are looking their best now ;
patronage and improvement seem to stimulate
one another. Many country visitors as well as
the urban regulars have been strolling through
during the holidays, and the music of a band
makes the Zoo a fine lounge of an afternoon....
On Saturday night, the staff, mental and mechani-
cal, of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, had a
festive dinner at Gunsler’s. Though there was a
good deal of toasting, the proceedings were not
dry, and success was drunk to the new issue. On
Monday morning tbo paper came out in a new
guise—it was written grammatically....Dr. Ellis
was presented with £137 on Monday night, at the
Protestant Hall. Large meeting of his admirers,
and Mr. T. B. Decent, as chairman, did the eulogy
part. The Dr. afterwards preached the New
Year in, at St. Matthias’s, Paddington.
The Hon. J. G. Ramsay, Minister of Works in South
Australia, was recently married at Sandhurst, to
Miss Bertha, daughter of Mr. Joel Horwood. For
nonevmoon, Melbourne and a coloniaL tour....
Dr. P. H, Metcalfe, the surgeon of Norfolk Island,
was married, in November, to Miss Janet, dau^rliter
of Mr F. Nobbs, of Longridge, where the breakfast
was held. The day was generally observed as a
holiday on the island... .Thomas King, M.P.ipf the
S. A. Advertiser), Mayor of Glenelg, gave a large
ball to Commodore Erskine and the officers of the
Nelson, last month. The Nelson is now at Hobart,
consequently the millinery trade at once becomes
brisk.


Mrv. Cuthbert Lysaght, 21, representing
In Sydney the Iron works firm of John Lysaght
(Limited) of London, Bristol, Wolverhampton, and
Sydney, went for a swim at iron Cove, Parramatta
River. A hoy on the bank saw him disappear, and
noticed simultaneously the water become stained
as with blood. A little while afterwards the
horribly mangled corpse of the unfortunate
gentleman was recovered by the searchers. A
shark—possibly the huge brute which some time
since killed a man in the same locality—had seized
and drawn him under. It is a wonder that sharks
do not kill more swimmers, considering that they
are extremely numerous in Australian waters, and
that, whenever they do attack a man, it is impos-
sible to make them relinquish their hold. At St.

Rooney, while bathing in the breakers, was seized
by a ten-foot shark. One Pritchard went to the
rescue on horseback, and succeeded in beating off
the brute, which, however, letting Rooney go,
completely bit through his thigh, and caused
him to bleed to death in a very few minutes- And
now a big shark has attacked a horse and rider at
Manly Beach.

We have an especial pleasure in noticing
the book of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” the cur-
ont pantomime of the Sydney Theatre Royal, for
reasons to which we would blush to give promi-
nence, but which are principally due, we consider,
to our having unearthed one of the smileless part-
authors. One of these distinguished literati is
“ Frautc W. Green, Esq.,” and the other —bat the
tortures of Tantalus would not induce us to reveal
oven a gm, (very nearly “germ,” isn't it) of his
initials. On the whole, however, we must sincerely
congratulate the local literatus (why not?) upon
the literary triumph of his labours; irrespective,
altogether, of a few pages of undiluted marmalade,
which appear-asthe Herald is so fond of stating
—“in another place in this journal.” As we feel
inclined to associate the localiser of "Jack and
the Beanstalk” with such celebrated writers as
we have, in our intervals of sobriety, blundered
across, we cannot forget that, in bis preface to
“The Revolt of Islam,” Shelley apologises to his
readers for “ the occasional use of an Alexandrine,
where (it being the Spenserian stanza) an Alexan-
drine is not (except in the terminating line of the
suuiza) imperatively required. Shelley was, how-
ever, presumably modest; mtus say—as he is dead-
more modest than moral. The part-author of the
panto, at the Royal is both or several; but. he
doesn’t—so far as we can see—apologise—even for
this monstre :—
“ Where’s Margery ? I’ll warrant she'll answer
you all. . „
Ah! there she is on the see-saw as usual.
But let us not be hard. Where the adapter of
“ Prank Green, Esq.,” may be said to fail compara-
tively in English, his success in French closely
borders on the phenomenal. Witness:—
“ In vain I try to leave this king of gluttons,
He drags me back, it’s revenous (sic) a nos (sic)
buttons.”
But where we think The Laughless One more
particularly excels is in the patriotic. There is
about these two couplets, now, something which
makes the heart beat faster, and which fires the
blood. Peruse:—
“The Redmonds , too, are gone; they found, I
ween. „
Australia loyal to old England s Queen!
I hope rid more they’ll kindle to a llamo,
Burning questions, burning only in the name.”
But after all, where we consider the localiser most
excels is when he tackles something social and
fatherly. The following has been equalled by few
librettists—excelled by none who have survived
the drop:—
“ Give them [The children. Let’s be fair."] roast
beef, then fill their little hearts
With technical lore at the School of Arts."
It must not be forgotten, however, that though
to the hypercritical the coupl. t we are about to
quote may be said to be picking in novelty, few
could question (with justice) its superior rhythm;—
“ H«re take a tract, called : Have you seen the
Shah? .
The voices of the mountain lambkins bah !
And here now is one that has also struck us ;—
“ With the Bookmakers I’ll never bet, my mater !
But put my money on the Totalisator ;"
et puis—
“ Back! baffled cowards, you’re acting like
fantees,
Bring out the battering ram there, if you please.”
Etencore —
“ Thanks I farewell friends ! and if again we meet
Don’t notice me, excepting in
After these quotations nothing will be wanting,
we take it, to convince the most sceptical as to the
literary splendour of this dazzling production.
But we always were convinced that G. . . .
(wo conceal his name for obvious
reasons) could do it. And he has done it.
The New Year and other cards at
Wallace’s constitute an Exhibition of the most
{esthetic character. No one who has ever invested
thereat, can number himself with those wha’ hae
wi’ Wallace bled, since the prices are so abnor-
mally moderate as to suggest the inference that
’tis Wallace alone who bleeds*
The Diamond Dyes are the best dyes made.
Have you tried them ? If not, then you should do
so. They are the best, and, at the same time, the
cheapest dyes in this market. Wby? Because
they are true to colour every time, and can always
be depended on to produce the desired effect. One
package will dye from three to four times more
than any other dyes sold. All dealers sell them, or
will get them for you. Insist on having them, and
take no others. All sold at one price; 6d. only.

WORLDLY WISDOM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AVhon that I wap fresh and hairless,
In the days of youth,
I was happy, gay, and careless,
Always speaking truth.
What a gladsome, sweet, comparelcss
Time that was, forsooth!
When I was a little older,
Alt my freshness went:
I grew more reserved and colder,
When my youth was spent—
Ma remarked I seldom told her
All I really meant.
When in middle age I landed,
And amassed a pile,
I grew mean and underhanded,
Full of worldly guile—
Telling lies, if biz. demanded.
With a winning smile.
Thus I waxed in wealth exceeding,
As the years progressed—
Making statements most misleading,
II they suited best;
Rich m>-n bleeding - never heeding
Such as were distressed.
I’ve attained a grand position.
Now that I am old,
Haring made my errthly mission
One of getting gold;
Still, at times, I fed contrition
For the lies I've told.

proving his partnership with Morgan, the bush-
ranger. “ What did we do oui'selves ? ” Why, we
expanded or enlarged our telegrams, by a system
of judicious interpolation, till they tilled a whole
column, and were just as trustworthy—especially
on Irish and other matters—as those of the Herald.
For instance, our Melbourne correspondent (3s. on.
a column) would wire:—“On dlt, Governor's daugli-

next morning as :—
“ FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
“APPROACHING NUPTIALS IN HIGH LIFE.
“ (From our Special Correspondent.)
“ Among tho upper social circles of the Southern
Metropolis quite a flutter of pleasing anticipation
has been caused by tho announcement that tno
popular Lady Clotilda, only daughter of Viscount
Carterberry, K.G., is about to approach the ixx-
meneal altar in company with our wealthy ana
distinguished townsman, Cyril Murphy, Esq.,
eldest son of Sir Lawrence Murphy, K.C.M.G., ot
Hughenden Lodge, Toorak. It is a happy omen
to Victoria’s future when h»r sans mingle among
the untarnished daughters of the old aristocracy,
and bear away brides to shed refinement and
culture round their Australian homes. The dis-
tinguished couple have our warmest congratula-
tions.” Wo thought this “ good ” for expansion,
but a late London libel action against Judy and
the Sportsman shows that we were mei e amateurs
in tho line. Tho "Central News Company ac-
cused the two papers of saying that its telegrams
were bogus ones, and the evidence disclose some
racy particulars of the manner in which Intelli-
cronoe is cooked to suit tho palate of tho British
public. A telegram of 16 words became one or 330
when published: one of 12 reached 710! A skele-
ton” of 30 words was worked up into two columns
ot telegraphic “ Irom Montreal
the wire su'd i 44 Plot explode Circassian Bcmouski
thwarted. Landsdowne’s movements circuitpus.
Halifax dynamiter sent trial.” " Special Cabinet
meeting. Quebec dynamite plot. .Lausdowno
discovered arrests probable. Intense excite-
ment. Princess indisposed inflamed eye. Under
the skilful hands of the “News Co.” the first ot
these became 314 words, and the second 629 ! Both
“expansions” detailed the movements of the In-
vincibles : the fact that "arrests will be made,’
that there was "anxious excitement among tho
populace,” and that “Lord and Lady Lansdowne
will become intensely popular.” In cross-exam-
ination it turned out that the statement; regarding
the "Invincibles” was "gag,” suggested by the
fact that Lord Lansdowne was an Irish landlord ;
“arrests will be made” was worked in because there
were so many detectives at large that thev were
bound to “scruff” somebody, it only to show
they earned their "tucker”; 1 anxious excite-
ment ” was tacked on because (as the witness said)
"it followed naturally,” and “Lord and Lady
Lansdowne will become intensely popular
(this was some time before they landed, mind you)
because —again the witness explains—* it would
be quite iu accordance with the public mind I
All the minut* telegraphic details inthe expan-

deduction from the words “ Plot explode Circas-
sian Remouski” contained in the skeleton tele-
gram. Alter, this one scarcely wonders that the
counsel for the defence (Mr. Crump) said that the
"expanded” article was not bona fide, but bogus,
and that the artist who “expanded” it was a
" liar.” And now we are prepared to sign a round
“ robin” to some Australian journals to give us in
future tho "skeletons” they get from home, and
let us put flesh on them ourselves or keep them iu
our cupboards as wo think fit.
Mountain Homes.
In a few months more it will be as difficult to
obtain allotments of land on the mountains as it is
now in and about the suburbs of Sydney. Every
person with a little nous or foresight is securing on
the mountains building sites of some description
or another, where he can find in his own
home a change from tho care and worry of
business, and, what is of more importance, a
change from tho atmosphere of tho sea coast. All
the auction sales on the mountains have invariably
run the prices up to a very high figure, but a new
arrangement has now been made by an enter-
prising firm in this city, which bids fair to meet
with far more public patronage than the old
costly plan of a big auction. Messrs. Boyd and
King, 322, George-street, have an estate at Black-
heath, on the mountains, placed in their hands,
and having made a’judlcious subdivision, they are
now placing tho blocks privately to any pur-
chaser at prices which arc bound to attract
buyers, no matter how tight the money mai’ket.
The figures are 75s. and 95s. in full, 10s. deposit,
and the balance at 5s. monthly without in-
terest, enabling an average householder to
secure on a small outlay a very accceptable
home in this the most delightful spot in all Aus-
tralia. The land is about the levelest on the
mountains, no gullies or ridges, and commands an
enchanting view of Kanimbla Valley and tho
surrounding picturesque country. Cards to view,
and full particulars, may be obtained on applica-
tion to Messrs. Boyd and King, 322 George-street.
In conclusion, it may bo mentioned that the x-eturn
fare to Blackheath is 6s., extending from Saturday
to Monday.*
John Graves, a Daylesford (V.) cricketer,
recently slogged a bail 160 yards, from hit to pitch.
Neither Bon. nor Murdoch have ever equalled
that lot. A team of English amateurs, including
Lord Harris and A. N. Hornby, intends visiting
Canada next season. Both Lord Harris and Mr.
Hornby were members of the team which visited
Canada in 1868.
The Earl of Rosebery is a man by the acci-
dent of birth. He happens also to be a lord; and
a good thing it is for the House of Lords that he
happens to swim in their boat. He and a few of
his sort are calculated to save the Peers from con-
tempt—and from mischievous sentiments worse
than contempt. He has culture, and can turn it
to the advantage of the common weal. He has
wealth, and does employ it beneficently. He has
high-toned (we had nearly said high-bred) in-
stincts, and he can deal with men as a man. He is
no Earl of Belmore, preaching a strait economy
because economy happens temporarily to suit the
fortunes of the House of Belmore. He is no
“ strawberry-leaved ” Manchester, platforming
around in the hope of working syndicates and
garnering in Queensland or other Australian
sugar for the behoof of a semi-beggared
ducal house Lord Rosebery, as it seems
to us, is an Individual capable of holding
his own as a man against snob and bummer,
and this is why we scout the idea of the Corpora-
tion of Sydney offering him an address of wel-
come on the occasion of his going away. He was
known to us as a Liberal politician before he set
his foot here; and if an address of welcome to
him was needed, the proposing of it should not
have been left to the hour of h>s departure. The
aldermanic mind must be taught to know that
between paying for foundations first and examin-
ing them afterwards, (and delightfully accepting
the deliverance of a statesman of proved worth
first and welcoming him afterwards) there is just
about the same amount of difference that there la
between an injury which may be forgiven and an
insult which cannot be pardoned. We regret that
the local experiences of a British visitor to Aus-
tralia of the Rosebery stamp should have been so
crossed by the ignorant lickspittle obsequiousness
of the actual and would-be C.M.G.’s of Sydney’s
social jar of tame vipers.
Lord Lome, a young man who at present
holds the pleasant little Government billet of
husband to the Princess Louise, suggests that
instead of the convening of a Federal Council or
Parliament out here, a CounciAof Envoys should
assemble in London as a preliminary step towards
the Federation of the Empire. In our opinion, as
regards this scheme, ’tis six of one and half-a-
dozen of the other. Both are so bad that’t would
he difficult to tell which was less en rapport with
those principles of republican independence which
are bound to dominate the Australian future. An
embassy almost invariably means a job; hence, a
Council of Envoys would inevitably mean some-
thing pretty well equivalent to a Syndicate of
Jobbers, each one more intent on getting his per-
sonal G C.M.G.-ship or Order of the Footbath than
on furthering the interests of his cabbage garden.
By the way, they don’t seem to think much of Mr.
Lome in Murker, for a leading journal irreve-
rently says:—“ In sending a garter to the auburn-
haired dude who figures as the husband of the
Princess Louise, the Queen has made a mistake.
It should have gone to Mrs. Louise, who is de-
cidedly the ‘grey mare,’ and who is said to very
greatly surpass her Scotch spouse in the matter of
calf.”
Perhaps one of the most extraordinary
cases ever tried anywhere, and for anything, has
just come off in the Court of Queen’s Bench,
London; and as wo know a good deal of the
parties personally, wo will just do something airy
anent the matter—something in our own modest
little style, with a possible crack at the end of the
par. Well, then, you must know that the swellest
barber in London is “Truefltt’s,” in Bond-street;
and “ subscription” being the rule there, that
shop is the resort of most of the metropolitan
mashers; and more particularly the x’esort of
those who—a little colonial phraseology—“ hold it
to a large extent.” In this Truefltt’s, you must
know, was a Miss Dredge, and to this Miss Dredge
one Clinton Wlnans proposed marriage. Winans
and his brother, we may remark, were of a
family of American millionaires, and they owned—
and own now, we suppose—two of the most
remax-kablo craft that have ever been constructed:
the big and the little cigar ships. These wonderful
steamers—shaped positively like a cigar, sharp at
both ends—could steam from 18 to 20 miles an
hour; but after a while they tired of these marine
toys (which muit have cost some £40,000) and they
wore left to rust in the West India Dock, and their
luxurious fittings and upholstery to grow rusty
and moth-eaten. After Miss Dredge’s mar-
riage had been arranged, however. Mr. Clin-
ton Winans represented to his fiancee that
should he marry her, his father would most
positively disinherit him; and upon these
representations, Miss Dx'edge consented (it is
admitted) after much pressure, to live with him;
which she did for five years, at tho expiration of
which period ho—but you can, of coux-se, guess-
married another woman. On this —we are speak-
ing of twelve years ago, mind —Miss Dredge
brought! an action for breach ot'Ipromise, and re-
covered £1500 damages, in addition to causing Mr.
Winans’ letters to bo read in Court. These
epistles—not two consecutive words of which
wore spelled correctly—set London in a roar, and
there was generally great glee over the whole
affair. After the case. Miss Dredge disappears:
but subsequently turns up at Bournemouth, where
she is doing a thriving trad® in the hair-dressing
and fancy business line. Her premises, it seemed,
were owned by a Mr. Joy, who, so far as palaces
go, is to Bournemouth, it seems,
(or Dibbs) is to North Shore. Anyhow, he in-
habited a lovely place called Seymour Hall, and
though 65 years of age, appeared, it seemed, quite
capable of “ doing a kill ” with ithe fair sex in
several directions. Mr. Joy. then, gets con-
siderably "gone” on Miss Dredge (sue called
herself “ Mrs. Miller” in Bournemouth), and
accordingly proposed, subsequently purchasing
for her jewellery and a trousseau. Later,
however, Mr. J. appeared to exhibit propen-
sities of a rather giddy nature. But hear a
bit of Miss Dredge’s evidence“ On Sunday, June
25, he called; and, as I was in bed, he asked if he
could come up and speak to me from the landing
at my bed-room door. He sat there with my
daughter at the window. The servant went to
church, and he sat smoking his cigar at the land-
ing window. He sent my daughter down stairs,
and then he deliberately walked into my bed-
room. He behaved in a very disgraceful manner,
and I ordered him out of my room. He refused,
and I rang the bell for my daughter; on which he
left. He had previously sent me in some letters
that some ladies had written to him. Amongst
these was one without a signature, in which a lady
threatened him, in the event of his marrying any-
one else. This is the lady he has since married.”
This Miss Dredge deposed in an action for breach
she instituted against Mr. Joy, and recovered
£2350 damages. Mr. J.—though, doubtless, Provi-
dence had, in an anatomical sense, awarded him
the usual number - had not, legally, a leg to stand
upon. He ( ays the paper) “denied the promls**,
and further alleged that when the promise (if any)
was made, he believed the plaintiff to be a chaste
woman, and a widow: whereas she was a single
woman, with an illegitimate child.” When the
case had proceeded a bit. however, Mr, Joy got
completely broken up. It seems, when arranging
the preliminaries of the marriage, Mr. Joy went
with Miss Dredge to dinner with one of her rela-
tions, a Mr. Miller; and after dinner Mr. M., at
the request of the plaintiff, told the ancient
Lothario what they termed Miss Dredge’s secret.
But nothing can be funnier than this slice from
the report“ After dinner he [Miller] and Mr.
Joy walked, and he told the latter Mrs. Miller had
never been married. He said, ‘I am under a
freat obligation to yon for your communication
am rather pleased than otherwise. (Laughter.)
For in previous marriages the results are un-
pleasant, and beget jarring notes.’ He also told
Mr. Joy that Mrs. Miller had, ever since he had
known her, acted as a lady ; that she was of a very
religious turn of mind. (Laughter.)” This, itseems,
was reaiy the case; for after the giddy conduct
of the old gentleman (recorded above) Miss Dredge
wrote him a letter, of which the following is a
portion Within one month of marriage is not
the time to indulge in nursery rhymes or scurril-
ous libels. If so you had better get a nurse. . .
It is not usual for a Christian man who is about
making a woman his wife to get her in an inter-
esting condition beforehand. Oh, Henry Joy, I
am ashamed of you !” And they gave her £2350.
We may conclude, therefore, that there is gloom
mingled with Joy at Bournemouth,
The best periodical for ladies to take
monthly, and from which they will receive the
greatest benefit, is Hop Bitters. Bead.
A great crowd of theatrical men, journal -
Ists, and others of akin, went down New York
Bay to meet Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. As in
the case of Mrs. Langtry, the English steamer
arrived at an unearthly hour of the morning; but
though everything was raw and cheerless. Irving,
says Flaneur, proved himself an agreeable man
of the world, of most charming and cordial
manners. He is remarkable for his poses of body,
and for his over-varying facial expressions. One
moment he cuddles his foot on his knee, then
drops it, and stretching at full length clasps both
hands behind his head; and next minute doubles
up in the awfully unconventional attitude of
embracing both knees with both arms. The
peculiarities are due to a nervousness of tempera-
ment. Miss Terry is also excitable, and never
still. When the steamer came up, she bounded
across the deck like a child, and, drawing herself
up by the halyards, got on her hnees on the taffrail.
She apparently had no skirts under her dress.
This is an extraordinary detail to state of a lady in
walkingicostume, but we wish to draw attention to
tho factjthat her activity was quite entrancing to
the men who watched her as she hung on the rail,
waving her handkerchief.
All agree that handsome hair is one of
beauty’s indispensable elements. Ayer’s Haibj
Vigor maintains it in freshness, brightness, and
luxuriance.
Cosmopolitan Courtship.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I admit I’m a fellow with rather a turn
For indulging in fleeting flirtations;
And live charming girls, whom I’ve courted in turn,
Have all been of different nations.
To hear each make love in her own mother-tongue
Was novel and piquantly pleasing—
Though all were alike, in so far they wore young,
And took very kindly to squeezing.
A smart little girl, of the Emerald Isle.
Was my first, young, romantic selection.
She favoured my suit, and, for some little while.
Most undoubtedly thought mo perfection;
So directly I begged her to be my fair bride,
And partake of my sunshine and sorrow.
She plumped herself down in a chair at my side.
And said, “Shure, I will, thin, begorral ”
A braw bonnie lassie, of Scotland’s cold clime,
With cheeks like a rose freshly blooming,
Had made me her captive in quite a short time-
tier manners were so unassuming.
I told her my love in a low, fervent tone,
One eve on the bank of the river,
How all through my life I’d adore her, alone—
She murmured, "Just speak to my mither.”
A French demoiselle was my next dainly “ mash,”
And we soon waxed uncommonly tender:
While often my arm took the place of her sash—
Her waist was so waspishly slender.
She vanquished my heart with her stylish French
So thus it fell out that ere long
I asked her to wed me—I couldn’t do less—
And her answer was, “ Out, certainement! ”
A fair, freckled frauletn then came in my way—
A damsel most plump and attractive;
I ventured a kiss, and she said me not nay
(Though her lips were exceedingly active).
Emboldened by silence, far warmer I grew,
And poured forth my eloquent soul:
I asked did she love me, and was that love true ?
She immediately whispered, “ Ja wohl.”
When this passion waned (like the others before),
A fresh girl I fairly got “ lost on:”
’Twas o’er the blue sea, on a far western shore
(i made her acquaintance in Boston).
A “ daisy” she was, with a sweet, winning grace
Which, surely, I ne’er shall forget:
I said “ Are you mine ? ” Then she laid her dear
face
On my shoulder, replying, “ You bet.”
But, spite of such frequent and certain success
In different lands, with their daughters,
Yet still, for all that, I am forced to confess
That I now live in bachelor’s quarters;
And if people ask “ In this sad single state
Do you really intend to remain long ? ”
I feel that I’m fairly content with my fate,
And say, “ Ja, begorra, certainement.
“Well, Billy, I haven’t seen you at Sunday-school lately.”
“No, Mr. Jones, Parson needs me to ruh down bis boss after church.”

conducted by Mr. G. G. Green, of Woodbury, New
Jersey. D.S.A. He is the proprietor of the well-
known Boschee’s German Syrup, which is un-
equalled as a remedy for Pulmonary and Bronchial
affections. He manufacturers also Green’s August
Flower for Dyspepsia and all disorders of the
Liver. These preparations are used throughout
the civilized world, and thousands testify to their I
valuable curative properties. Both these prepara-

VARIOUS VERSES.
Our Troubles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tho world is selfish. Even we,
Whose reckless generosity
A household word is: even we.
For, when we hoar of the fell breath
Of plague th it far lands visiteth—
Of battle, murder, sudden death;
Of broken bubbles
That break men’s hearts—or that tho gay
Wife of our best friend, but to-day
Has with a coachman run away—
Wo shrug our shoulders, smile, and say,
“ Our troubles!"
AVe're not alone in this. It pays.
So is a very common phase
Of human nature. When belays
His odds and doubles,
Think you tho bold bookmaker grieves
For the poor wretched clerks turned thieves
That go to gaol to pay him ? Heaves
He sigh ? Ho smiles In both his sleeves,
“Mu troubles!”
The parson is both fair and fat;
A poor man, with a broken hat
And unshorn cheeks with hunger flat
And sharp with stubbles,
Comes to him, “Sir, my wife is nigh
To death—for food my children cry;
Help us, sir ?” Says he, “ Look on high ;
God will provide ” If not, they die.
His troubles ?
The last of all a gallant band,
Bent to explore an unknown land,
Lies down to die on desert sand
Or dreary scrub-hills;
His widow’s and his orphans’ claims,
Who heeds ? You’d think, at least, for shame’s
Sake Gov’ment would, or its own fame's:
The members call each other names.
Their troubles.
A poet with a pen of speed,
Who writes (and blushes) this same screed,
And plays upon a mellow reed
As soft as Jubal’s
(Yes-tbis pronunciation’s rare:
JKbal is dead, so he won’t care).
Though he makes music in his hair,
When to achieve a meal that’s square
He’ll to the editor repair,
He will by him be slaughtered there:

Rev. Father Wilds’
EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of tho
Massachusetts Supreme Court, tvrltes
as follows:
“ 78 E. 54th St., New York, May 16,1882,
Messrs. J. C. Ayer & Co.. Gentlemen:
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that I could scarcely bear any clothing
over them, I was also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; my
appetite was poor, and m.y system a good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time tho fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. My catarrh and cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. 1 feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of tho Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best blood medicine ever devised. I took
it in small doses three thugs a day, and
used, in all, less than two bottles, I place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
Yours respectfully, Z. P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla to the cure of all diseases arising
from Impure or impoverished blood, and a
weakened vitality.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
cleanses, enriches, and strengthens the blood,
stimulates the action of tho stomach and
bowels, and thereby enables the system to
resist and overcome the attacks of all Scrofu-
lous Diseases, Eruptions of the Skin, Rheu-
matism, Catarrh, General Debility, and all
disorders resulting from poor or corrupted
blood and a low state of the system,

No Danger can Attend its Use.
Nervous Depression from Overwork.
Sluggish Circulation and Growing Chil-
dren.
Sandusky, 0., May 21, 1880,
I have used your Acid Phosphate and can pro-
nounce it a very valuable addition. I find it use-
ful and beneficial in nervous dyspepsia, nervous
depression following'overwork and anxiety, as well
as the gastric derangements. Whore there is
venous stagnation and sluggish circulation, a dull,
heavy head, it is of undoubted value. Fast grow-
ing children require this valuable addition.
W. R. PAGE, M.D.
Liver and Kidney Derangements.
Boston, Mass., May 18,1880.
In regard to the Hereford's Acid Phosphate, I
have used it very extensively, aud with the most
remarkable success.
1 give it in dyspepsia and in all cases where there
is derangement ot the liver and kidneys. With
my patients it has agreed wonderfully.
O. G. GILLEY, M.D.
Nerve Tonic.
A, S. Carpenter, M,D., Keene, N.H., says :
“ Hereford's Acid Phosphate is a valuable medi-
cine. I have taken it myself, and for several
years prescribed it for my patients, when suffering
from indigestion or innervation of the digestive
organs, and always with satisfactory results. It is
a good nerve tonic, and in some cases of morbid
urine, * it acts like a charm,’ producing the desired
result. It is pleasant to the taste, acceptable to the
stomach, and is, in my opinion, an excellent and
valuable compound.”
Can be borne by the most Sensitive
Stomachs.
Fair Haven, N.Y., March, 1880.
Hereford's Acid Phosphate, in elegance of com-
position, stands unrivalled. It is pleasant to the
taste, and can be borne by the most sensitive
stomach. Have prescribed it with marked benefit
in indigestion and urinary troubles. It forms an
excellent substitute for l,emon juice, and as such
will furnish a refreshing‘drink for the sick.

For many years the War Office people
stoutly opposed the popular view that a tailor Is
only the ninth part of a man. The tailors who
enlisted had. like other recruits, to be up to the
full standard in height and chest measurement.
The result was that some of the smartest men in
Her Majesty’s land forces were sartorial artists.
Indeed, we remember one regiment —indifferently
known as the “ dirty 50th,” or the “ blind half
hundred ” — where discipline was seriously
endangered when Jock M’Farantosh got an extra
nobbier of rum. Jock was the handiest tailor in
the corps. Of course it was ridiculous to see a
needle in the hands of a man that could have
humped a plough or up-ended a tramcar: but ho
was proud of his profession, and the man that
Insulted a tailor in his presence was never fit tor
much beyond a corner bed in an incurable asylum
for the reraaind jr of his life. By the number and
character of the cases which went to the regimen-
tal hospital in the morning, the amount of grog
Jock had had the night before could always bo
roughly estimated. When only ten or a dozen
men weie seen limping across the square, with
their noses in slings, and their uniform scarcely
sufficient for conventional requirements, Jock
had only had a pint or so of alcohol and only used
his hands. But when the whole of No. 5 company
was observed trailing in Indian file toward the
infirmary, with a couple of ambulance waggons
behind to pick up the ‘‘lame duens,” you could
tell that Jock had been drinking, that he had used
his goose, and that ho was at present tied with a
hawser to a lleld-gun outside the guard-room.
And this brings u« back to the War Office authori-
ties. By a late circular it has been decided that
tailors two inches below the regulation height and
two inches short of the standard chest measure-
ment, may bo enlisted. Were Jock M'Farintosh
alive no v, instead of being coiled cosily under the
daisies ten feet below the earthworks at liangariri
with the dozen Maoris he had brained to keep him
company, this reflection on the profession he loved
would have broken his proud heart.
Before this par. is in type, the Rev. W, H.
Ulmann. M.A., and Mrs. U. will have left for Fng-
land. Why they are going at this juncture does
not appear quite clear, since it is only very lately,
Indeed, that they have got the Gospel Array into
working order; and, by departing now, they will
contrive to cross Mr. Booth—tho Apostle of the
Blue Ribbon Army, who is even now on his way
out, and at whose “send off” at Kxeter Hall Mr.
Spurgeon presided. The Vanqtiaud, Mr, UJ-
mann’s is now before us, and, though the
sheet in question is a ludicrous journalistic effort,
Mr. U. and his good lady appear to be very much
In earnest. According to their representations,
they have subscribed everything to the cause
they have adopted; and we sec no reason to doubt
this, though wo could wish that every item in
their little paper was not such a howl lor money.
Here’s a sample par.“ £64 raised, thank the
Lord I . . £160 is wanted to purchase return
tickets.” Then, “ promised subscriptions towards
the new hall, Parramatta: Hen. Blake (the Halle-
lujah saddler), 5s.” Believing, however, in the
sincerity ot' Mr. Ulmann, we are inclined to prefer
his piety to his poetry, a chunk of which is as
follows l—
“ Our foes arc in the field, pressing hard on every
side,
Envy, anger, hatred, with self and pride &c.
Well, we wish the Gospel Army General and Mrs.
S. J. (presumably Sarah J«ne) Ulmann a pleasant
trip home in the Liguria ; and we trust under the
captaincy ot Miss Lizzie Thompson the shadow
of the Army will not grow less during their
absence. We sympathise with Mr. U. very much;
but we are inclined to wish what old Ohivery did
with regard to young John —‘‘that he wouldn t
lay out so much money on it.” This wish is sug-
gested by the following intimation in the Van-
ouaud. “Our soul-saving in Parramatta has
cost £30 more than the receipts.” Parramatta,
we always thought, w°uld take a thundering lot
Of converting, by the way, Mr. Ullmann has just
been fined 10s. at barramaita for obstructing the
thoroughfare with his "Army.” That’s aivvays
the way. When j on stop a man who is on t io road
to Gehenna and drive him back and try to round
him up into the stockyard of glory, yon are given
many stripes.
The Rev. Robert Topham, M.A., is Vicar
of Etruria (Eng.) Wandering in the Henley
Borough Cemetery, he observed some choice
flowers, and Satan (ever at hand when anything
dirty has to be suggested) whispered him that the
parish children’s fete, took place next day, and that
the church was badly in want of pretty flowers for
the occasion. “Or what use,” remarked Robert,
thoughtfully, “are these sweet things in a bone-
yard 7 They are for the quick, not for the dead.”
He was quick, and soon had concealed about his
person enough blossoms to fill a furniture-van.
From his hit, hoots, and pockets roses and wood-
bine struggled, daffo ils and mignonette lined his
sleeves, while his breadth of beam was suggestively
increased by the violets and pansies with which
he stuffed his nether garment. But the world is
cold and unsympathetic, and Topnam, M.A., had
to appear before his brother “beaks” for leaving
the Henley Borough Cemetery as innocent of
flowers as a Salvation Army Tambour-Major of
h’s. A summons was issued. At first he
could not appear, owing to a bad cold. Then
an officer was sent; but he failed to “draw”
tne Key. Robert. An Irish servant answered
the bell, and, after some highly personal allusions
to the official’s ensemble,' told him that her master
Avasn’t at home—he avbs working in the garden.
When this message was brought back to the
assembled magistrates, they saw the “constitu-
tion ” was at siake : so they resolved to fetch him
if they had to send a troop of yeomanry. A cab
was prepared, tilled with energetic policemen, and
a third cull was made on the obdurate clergyman.
He was in bed this time. At last a warrant was
Issued; and to get over the necessity for “ running
him in” for the night, a special afternoon meet-
ing of magistrates was convened. Then he ap-
peared, when the chairman told him that tne
original offence was slight In comparison w ith the
mountain of lies behind which ho had endeavoured
to hide. Had he been a labouring man who’d killed
a rabbit, now he would have been “scruflsd”
along I There would have been no afternoon
meeting, and he would have been “ chucked ”
into a cell like a sack of potatoes. He was repri-
manded and discharged. On the same day a poor
woman was brought before another Bench 'or
walking off—by mistake-with a small carpet bag
from the railwav statioh. It belonged to one Ben.
Allen, a medical student, and when the lady
opened it, a couple of toothless skulls and half a
dozen lumbar vertebras rolled out o i the floor.
She has been raving ever since, and was “ sent up ”
by a Bench partly composed of the very men who
jet the parson off for stealing flowers. Give us
English law administered by county magistrates.
The cemeteries in New Zealand, where
hundreds of British soldiers are buried who fell in
action against the Maorh-s during the troubles
from ’00 to ’65, are overgrown with weeds, over-
run with pigs, and scandalously neglected in every
way. For the repair of some of them in the
Waikato, a largo sum was voted by Parliament,
but the shrewckpersons to whom it was entrusted
deliberately diverted it—according to a local paper
—to the repair of roads through property in which
some of them had an interest. " What do we care
tor dead soldiers’ bonesV” they said; “one live
settler is worth twenty dead imm.” England has
been singularly unfortunate in obtaining the
giatitude of colonists she preserved from anni-
hilation. They tirst whine for protection, then
grow rich over a lavish commissariat expenditure,
and wind up, when the danger is'oyer and their
pockets stuffed with English gold, by abusing the
men who saved their throats from being cut. In.
thatcharming story, “The Virginians,”
tells us how the colonists who Induced the British
Government to send the unfortunate Braddock
and his ill-fated expedition to save them from the
French believed that their sole duty consisted in
saving their skins and robbing the expeditionary
force by means of o>orbitant prices fofthe neces-
saries of life. The French officers who, twenty
vears after, helped the Americans Jo gain their
independence, returned to Francefuflof contempt
for the grasping sordidness of v ehe .people they
had assisted in their hour of need. The British
Government poured 10,000 regulartroops into New
Zealand, spent blood and money prodigally, broke
the back-bone of the Maori power, and gave over
to the colonists thousmds of square miles of
fruitful country. Their men were rewarded by
being called cowards and assassins by the people
they had foolishly saved. The graves of the dead
are given over to pigs and weeds. There are still in
the colonies many of those who saved Taranaki, and
subsequently fought in Waikato and at Taurauga.
There is but one hope among them, and that is
that a Maori raid is still possible down the Waikato
Valley, How those fat and prosperous settlers
would alter their tune if they saw native rifle-pits
being thrown up within musket-range ! Again,
at the Cape, the same dreary lesson was rehearsed.
What would have become of the Natal settlers if
Cetshwayo and his Zulus had got among them?
Yet, in a few years we shall be told that the bones
of the men who fell at Isandula, Rorke’s Drift,
and Ulundi are not worth one half-caste Kaffir.
Colonies are like a good many daughters. The
more tenderly you treat them the more likely they
are when grown up, to take a fancy to somebody
else, and even say hard things of those who protec-
ted them when they were helpless.
That venerable philanthropist, Sir Moses
Montcflorc, has just attained his hundredth year.
So runs an item of news from Europe. Sir Moses
is a very remarkable man. It was he to whom
her present Majesty Queen Victoria owes her
position as Queen. When the Duchess of Kent
was in an interesting condition, at Brussels, nobody
thought or cared much about it. The Duke of
Kent was one of the youngest of George III.’s sons.
The Duke of Clarence was heir-apparent, and ho
and Adelaide were still a comparatively young
couple. But the old Hebrew had “ monish” in the
business. The Duke of Kent was considerably in
his books for accommodation. And the wary Jew
had thought all round his chances and his security.
It was he who pointed out to the Duke of Kent —
who, with all respect be it said, was nearly as great
an ass as his brothers, G eorge III.'s other sons —
how near to the throne the unbern child might yet
be. George having practically divorced his wife,
and W.lli un being childless, Sir Moses urge 1 upon
the Duke the imperative necessity of the expected
prince being born on British soil, in order to bo
qua'ifled to ascend the throne. And the Duke,
more because he owed old Moses a lot of
money, and couldn’t afford to neglect his
order—we mean advice—than because he quite
caught the hang of the thing, actually
brought his wife over to England, where
little Vic. was born, and Moses’ “securltish"
looked up considerably. He always was a good-
natured sort, and at different times has given away
very large sums for charitable purposes. His
great fad was the Restoration of the Hebrew Race
| to Palestine, and he bled freely for anything con-
nected with the Jews in Jerusalem. Thus he is
fairly entitled to bo called a philanthropist, as the
phrase goes now-a-days. This is, of course, very
different from being a real philanthropist. Sir
Moses is worth a mint of money, and has been
knighted, and is a hundred years old. No
man could truly be a philanthropist and
j fulfil these conditions. We will endeavour to
illustrate our meaning by a fable. One day
Jupiter, being in a good humour, took it into his
head that morta's were rather interesting insects
after all, and declared that he would supply the
world with enough of subsistence to make every
one comfortable. So he rained down a quantity of
nectar and ambrosia sufficient to give a square
meal and a long-sleevor to every person then
living. But as lie happened to have sent his sieve
away for repairs, and lent his watering-pot to old
Aquai’ius, who, of course, hadn’t returned it, in-
stead of sifting d own the ambrosia in particles and
drizzling the nectar in a tine rain, he threw down
the first in chunk», and the latter he poured down
in basketsful. Thus it happened that some men
secured whole heaps of ambrosia, and scooped up
hogsheads of nectar, while others failed to secure
a particle of the one or a irop of the other. Now,
some of the lucky ones were hard customers; and
when they perceived that they were “ in it,” they
made up their minds to look out entirely for
number one. So, when the poor wretches who
had got nothing raised cries thxt they were hungry
and thirsty, these lucky ones got very indignant,
and denounced such complaints as wicked. And,
as they feared that the hungry crowd might be
Impelled by want and necessity to take a share by
force, they called in the augurs, and soothsayers,
and high-priests, who had a lot of influence over
the people generally, and contracted to allow them
a decent whack; provided they would declare that
Jupiter had deliberately intended to favour some
and starve others. Tnis the soothsayers and
others readily agreed t» do. So they and the
lucky ones got up a cry in reply to the yells
of th? famishing, and declared very solemnly
that such complaints wore the blackest impiety,
and a blasphemous Hying in the face of Pro-
vidence. There were others among the lucky
ones who ran pretty nearly the same ticket, but
being good-hearted fellows in tbeir way, made out
that Jupiter had me nt them to be his stewards.
These, when th-y started off with their big
plunder, met a lot of very hungry people—famish-
ing men, haggard women, and perishing children.
And when the good-natured luoky ones met the
first of these, they gave each a bite and a sup.
But, by and bye, they saw their store dwindled to
half, and still a regular crowd surrounded them.
“Hang it all 1” they said; “ this will never do. If
we give a bite and a sup to each, we shall only
have a bite and a sup left for ourselves! And we
want a regular blow-out.” So they agreed among
themselves that Jupiter must be infinitely pleased
with their generosity in giving away so many bites
and sups, and argued that although there were
infanta perishing, and women wailing, and L>.en
breaking down and going mad and bad, for lack of
a decent share, then had done their duty, and
could shut their ears and have a blow- out with an
easy conscience. And the soothsayers, who were
a class much guided by their sensitive noses,
scented, intuitively that there was nothing to be got
by joining in with the” have-nots,” and they sniffed
considerable pdour of victuals in the quarters of
the generous •‘have-alls.” 8o they praised the
“have-alls” very highly for their generosity to
half the starving neople, and made no unpleasant
remarks about the other half, and thus frequently
got bites of amorosia and draughts of nectar
themselves. And i.ho soothsayers and the “ have-
alls” praised Juniter very much for his sagacity in
Sicking out such good men to be “ have-alls,” and
umbly prayed him to forgive toe “have-nots”
for their wicked discontent. And when the “ have-
nots” pretended that it was truly blasphemy to
ascribe such unjust division to Jupiter, and a
mere trick to conceal the fact that the “ have-alls”
had grabbed more than their share, the sooth-
sayers and the “ have-alls” united in shrieking
that the impiety and scoundrelism of the “have-
nots” were perfectly unbearable, and required to
be put down with the strong hand. And both
parties prayed to Jupiter. But he simply smiled,
and remarked that he had implanted an instinct of
self-preservation in every mortal’s breast; and as
the " have-nots” immensely out-numbered the
“have-alls,” they didn't need any supernatural
interference. If they let themselves bo fooled by
the tricks of the “ have-alls” and the humbug of
the soothsayers, that was their own look out.
They should know that Jupiter could not possibly
do anything unfair or cruel, .lust so; Sir Moses
Montettore is a good-natured old man. But he is
not a groat philanthropist. Had he been that, he
would not now he a knight, worth a cool £500 UOO,
and one hundred years of age. He would have
divided his last sixpence with a cripple eighty
years ago, and have been executed wiih ignominy
as a Communist. All great philanthropists have
been poor, ragged, obse me while they lived, and
either poisoned, hung, shot, or crucified.
