BY A BUSH BOOKSELLER.
What do bush readers buy ? Well, here’s a bush
reader coming into the shop now. Look at him !
Red hair, all over his face; dirty clothes; and a
Atrone smell of old pipes about him. Now, listen !
“ D’ye sell books, misther ?”
“Yes.”
“ ’Av’ yer got Willv Ro-o-i-illy ?”
“No.”
“ ’Av’ yer got ‘ The Red Hand of Ulsther ?•”
“No.”
“Well, ’av’ yer got ‘ Spaches from the Dock’ ? ”
“No.”
“ Shure, yerz got no books at all.”
There, you see, he leaves after making a spittoon
of the floor ; and smell the tobacco-juice ! Here’s
Another.
“ Have you got ‘ Maria Monk ’ ?”
“No, I don’t keep such trash.”
“You’re a mug, then ; you’d sell whips of
them. Anyhow, what d’ye want for ‘Ned
Kelly?’ ”
, “Two shillings.”
“ Two shillings ! All right, I’ll take it.”
He’s off —and my matches, too, from the
counter. Watch this fellow with the gaiters !
“ I want a decent book.”
“There you are, have a look round.”
“ Right, go on with your biz ; I’ll just run over
them. ”
Hear his profane remarks ! He’s “ read them
of course.
“ What fools buy these ? ”
(Wait
“ Hav.- y. m jrot ‘ Robbery Under Arms ? ’ ”
“ I sold the last yesterday.”
“Why, strike me dead! there’s one in the
window.”
“ Oh, I beg your pardon, I forgot that one.”
Now I’ll stack the books up again. . . Look
At this woman with the large family !
“ I want something to read—you know, mister,
something interesting and lively.” (Makes one
wonder how she can find time to read with all
those youngsters.) “ I’ll leave it to you to recom-
mend, sir.”
“Well, here’s some of Miss Braddon’s.”
“Oh, I’ve read them.”
“ Well, here’s a work, ma’am, that every woman
should read. It was suppressed some time ago;
it’s by Mrs. Besant.”
“ What, the lady that was lecturing in Sydney
the other day ? ”
“ Yes.”
“ How much?”
Sold ! It’s wonderful how quick a “suppressed”
work will sell. Then another class of people won’t
lead a book unless it’s brought under their notice
in some peculiar manner. Here’s an instance.
We have a racehorse here called Jack Sheppard,
who won the big race last meeting. I happened
to have a lot of Ainsworth’s “ Jack Sheppard ” on
hand which I couldn’t sell before, but after the
races I sold them in a fortnight. The buyers
must have thought it a sporting yarn.
A mild-spoken man came in one day and said,
“ I see you’ve got a grand assortment of books.”
“ Middling,” said I.
He bent over the counter and whispered, “ Have
you got anything blue ?”
“ Blue ! No? I haven’t got any Blue-Books;
they’re all yellow-backs.”
With a look of contempt he left the shop. I
was green then, and wondered what he meant;
but I’ve had plenty customers of the same sort
since.
The “Young Lad i es’ Journal, ” * ‘Family Herald, ”
And “Bow Bells” kind of literature is most in
demand with female readers—which, no doubt.
Accounts for the aristocratic names of the little
girls who attend our State schools. It’s sur-
prising what a number of Cissys, Mauds, Ethels,
Gwendolines, Ediths, and Gladys there are, com-
e,red with the Marys, Marthas, Janes, and
ates. (No one ever christens a daughter Brid-
get nowadays).
Dream books? Yes, and books of fate, mar-
riage guides, fortune-telling books, and so on.
Tbe girls simply doat on them.
No use recommending any of the standard
authors—Dickens, Thackeray, Lytton. Don’t
seem to suit most bush-readers. In fact, I’ve
found it’s not good policy to recommend a book at
all. I just say : “No, I don’t like it myself; I’ve
read it, but too much blood about it for me.” Off
it goes at once !
Woman authors are bad stock, no matter how
flaring the picture on the cover. Poetry is a dead
letter, though a few years ago I sold a “ Byron ”
to a giddy youth. I started a lending-library
onee, but soon got full of it. I mean I got empty
of it—books as well.
The only boom in my book trade was when
Deeming was being tried. Everybody wanted to
know when his life was to be published, with full
details. Of course I booked a lot of orders. Since
then it’s all detective tales, bushranging yarns,
and heroes of the prize-ring. I asked one of my
customers if he’d read “Sherlock Holmes.”
“ Who the is he ?” he growled. I counter-
manded the order to the wholesale house at once,
as I didn’t care about waiting so long for the book
to get popular amongst my far-off patrons. I
ordered two dozen “ Newgate Calendars ” instead.
That’s always popular—the standard work of tbe
bush.
We have a few enquiries for “ Mysteries of the
Court of London.” I shall order some. I try to
supply all my customers’ literary wants, and I
think I have fairly succeeded ; but when they
want “ Maria Monk,” “The Escaped Nun,” and
“ blue books,” I’m not on. No ; I refer them to
the School of Arts.

THE “KEEPER" PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
tor this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing as they do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
llS e but now arrangements have been completed to make

country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will he sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to

however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER" LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim tor this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH FILL.

•work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TEV
•THIS’ PILL. It Is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size

•trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement

“The mutiny of the Bounty was not

Encyclopedia Bkitannica.
Dear Bulletin, —An interesting subject
for you ; How used N.S.W. aborigines bury their
dead ? The blacks of the South Coast, at
Moruya, Bateman’s Bay, and Nelligen, used to
carry their dead about with them for several
weeks, stretched full-length in a sheet of bark,
which, as the corpse shrivelled up, they tightened
and lashed with stringy-bark or vines. They
never buried their dead near the place where
he or she died; and when they did dispose
of the corpse they sought a hollow tree, in
whose barrel they dropped it—immediately
clearing out to watch the spot for several
weeks from the highest location they could reach.
Many years before I was born, the Nelligen
(N. S. W.) blacks “ buried ” one of their dead in
this manner at one of the late Mr. Nolan’s cattle-
stations. My late father was in charge, and as
the stench from the corpse was unbearable to him
and his hut-keeper, they cut a hole one evening in
the butt of the tree and set fire to it. The blacks
saw the fire, and, as this was their method of
signalling to each other, they rushed down in war-
paint to the number of about 400, but, not in time
to save their friend, who was effectually cremated.
Only about 16 years ago the skeleton of an
aborigine was found in a tree at Bodalla, and I
have heard of others being found east of Braid-
woo 1.

A BIG BIZ!
jur Trade is Big! Our Store is Big I
Our Ideas are Bigi
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us! All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure erf affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough, chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.*

THE GARRET.
O, it was here that love his gifts bestowed
Dn youth’s wild age !
Gladly once more I seek my youth’s abode
In pilgrimage:
Here my young mistress with her poet dared
Reckless to dwell.
She was sixteen, I twenty, and we shared
This attio cell.
Yes, twas a garret! be it known to all
Here was love’s shrine.
1 here read in charcoal, traced along the wall,
1 he unfinished line ;
Here was the board where kindred hearts would
blend ;
The Jew can tell
How oft I pawned my watch to feast a friend
In attic cell.
O’ my Lisette’s fair form could I recall
With fairy wand !
There she would blind the window with her shawl,
Bashful, yet fond.
What tho from whom she got her dress I’ve since
Learned but too well,
Still in those days I envied not a prince
In attic cell.
Here the glad tidings on our banquet burst
Mid the bright bowls :
Yes it vas here Marengo’s triumph first
Kindled our souls!
Bronze cannon roared, France with redoubled
might
Felt her heart swell!
Proudly we drank our Consul’s health that night
In attic cell.
Dream of my youthful days, I’d freely give.
Ere my life’s close,
All the dull days I’m destined yet to live
For one of those.
Where shall I now find raptures that were felt
Joys that befell
And hopes that dawned at twenty when I dwelt—
In attic cell.
Biranger—Englished by Father Mahoney.
A correspondent writes to Otago Wit-
ness (M.L.) on the vastness and resource of the
.Scotch language as compared with the scantiness
of the English :—
You can say in English “ a large dog,” or “ a small
dog,” but there you’re done. In Scotch you can sav—
A doag.
A wee doag.
A wee bit doag.
A wee bit bitty doag.
A we bit doagity doag.
A sma’ doag.
A inuckle doag.
A language with so many different shades of dog
in it deserves to be treated with respect.
Dear Bulletin,— From J. M. Barrie’s
memorial poem on the late Robert L. Stevenson :
We made the doakens walk the plank
That free I like to gar you loup.
One of these days a competent ITinglish satirist,
of the W. S. Gilbert type, will expose the humbug
of modern Scotcli lingo verse. He may even have
the temerity to suggest that a good deal of Robbie
Burns is drivel in disguise. Anyway, it is clear
that a Scawtch versifier has an unfair pull over his
brother born South of the Tweed, because he can
rhyme “round” with “ground” one minute and
“roun”’ with “town” the next. Take Bobbie
B.’s “The Cotter’s Saturday Night ” :
Belyve the elder bairns come drapping in,
At sen ice out, amang the farrmrs roun’ ;
Some ca’ the pleugh, some herd, some tentie rin
A cannie errand to a neebor town.
A little further on it suits the immortal Robert to
talk the language of Shakespeare :
O happy love ! where love like this is found!
O heartfelt raptures ! bliss beyond compare 1
I’ve paced much this weary mortal round,
And sage Experience bids me this declare.
Take the same overrated Scotchman’s last verse of
“ A Vision ” :
He sang vvi’ joy the former day,
He weeping wail’d his latter times
But what he said it was nae play
I winna venture’t in my rhj mes.
Isn’t that a drivelling conclusion '! What would
one say to a bard who wrote :
His song erstwhile in gladness woke
The day ; he wail’d his latter times;
But what he said it was no joke,
I dare not put it in my rhymes.
Yours, Cockney.

The project to establish a new daily morn-

and machinery have been secured, and a start
will be made as soon as the time is judged pro-
pitious. Architect Gailey, who isn’t over well
pleased with the treatment he got from the
Courier people, is a leading supporter of the ven-
ture, which is said to be backed by several sub-
rosa politicians who can’t trust the existing press
—all butterers of Boodlewraith. The new journal
is to be “independent ” (of course); and its career
will depend chiefly upon the amount of brains at
the back of it.

SATURDAY, MARCH 9, 1895.
"The Bulletin’s” Motion of Censure.
LaSt week the N.S. Wales Opposition,turned
up with the usual motion to the effect that
the country was “dissatisfied” with the
present Government. The motion was dis-
tinctly illogical, for to ask Parliament to
decide whether the country was or was not
dissatisfied with the Government implied
that the matter was open to doubt, and that
the country might be really satisfied after
all. As the country always is dissatisfied
with the Government, this aspect of the case
is supremely ridiculous. The question to be
settled in every want-of-confidence debate is
whether the country objects more strongly
to the existing Ministry than it thinks
it would to any other Ministry which it
is likely to get —in other words, whether it
is more aggravated at the Cabinet than
usual; and, as no one can really tell how
aggravated the country usually is, even this
is a matter which is difficult of decision. The
fact that the nation always objects to the
Government is sufficiently demonstrated by
the fact that almost every Government holds
office until the very first opportunity which
the country can find of ejecting it, and no
longer. And the fact that the country
always objects to the Opposition is similarly
evidenced by the fact that, when it becomes
a Government, it is also ejected just as soon
)is the nation can find a chance to get rid of
it. Therefore, the life of every Cabinet is
divided into three stages : first, the stage in
which the nation objects to the Opposition
rather more than it does to the Ministry ;
second, that in which the country objects to
them both equally ; third, that in which it
objects to the Ministry rather more than it
does to the Opposition.
« * •
The troubles and incoherencies of Party
Government are many, and when a sad,
ejected politician rises to state that the
country isn’t satisfied with the Ministry —as
if any country was ever satisfied with any
Ministry—they are intensified rather than
alleviated. The Ministry, as a rule, doesn’t
know what the country wants. Neither
does the Opposition. The country, in many
cases, doesn’t know with any degree of cer-
tainty what it wants itself, and when it does
know it has no means of informing its Parlia-
mentary representatives. All it can do is
to .elect them, and leave them to find out
to which of their opinions their election
was owing. They never do find out,
however, for the necessary machinery
for making the discovery doesn’t exist.
Parliament, in its turn, has no definite
means of letting the Government know what
it wants, save by ejecting it. When the
Ministry learns by an adverse vote the real
opinion of the House on some important
question, it has straightway to leave office
and go where it can’t make any use of its
newly-acquired information. Often, how-
ever, a Ministry is ejected on a general vote
of “ dissatisfaction,” and then it leaves office
without knowing why it is turned out, and
the other party comes in without knowing
why it has come in. The House simply
states that it thinks that the country thinks
that the Cabinet has done something it
shouldn’t have done, and the new Govern-
ment comes in on the ground that the House
believes the country is of opinion it should
do something which its predecessor didn’t
do, or not do something which its prede-
cessor did. A general motion of dissatis-
faction conveys less valuable information
than anything else in the domain of Party
Government.
* • »
In these years of financial leanness all
Ministries come into office with a general
instruction to retrench and make the finances
square, or at least to make them look square.
This is the one thing that is definitely under-
stood where everything else is vague and
shadowy. Also, most Ministries go out of
office on the ground—among others —that
they didn’t retrench ; the rest go out on the
ground—among others —that they did re-
trench. A retrenching Ministry, like every
other, holds its precarious situation from
hour to hour, by the votes of its individual
supporters, and these supporters have to be
individually placated by not retrenching their
friends or relatives or constituents, and by
finding billets for their friends and relatives
and constituents, and by <Constructing public
works in their electorates, and other expen-
sive devices. The average Cabinet keeps in
office by doing these things, and when the
inevitable deficiency arrives it is ejected for
doing them by the same people who would
otherwise have ejected it for not doing them.
A Ministry is a particularly wretched species
of public servant which is always liable to be
dismissed at a moment’s notice for not carry-
iug out instructions, which, as a rule, it
didn’t receive, and it fails to get these in-
structions from a body of men who are also
acting on instructions which they didn’t
receive. Also, its degradation is emphasised
by the constant accusation that it hangs on
to office for the sake of the salary attached.
Which accusation, by the way, is almost
invariably true ; everybody—even raonarchs
and bishops and scavengers—hangs on
to office for the sake of the attached salary,
and even the scavenger’s billet would be a
precarious one if the other scavenger, who
wanted it, could get it by moving that the
present holder of the job didn’t possess the
confidence of the country.
The average Ministry is weak, because it
doesn’t know what the country wants it to
do, or what the Pailiament wants it to do,
and because it isn’t appointed by anyone in
particular, but comes into existence by a
process of secret negotiation, which is known
as “forming the Cabinet.'’ Parliament has
a right to express its disapproval of the
Cabinet after it is formed by the simple pro-
cess of knocking it on the head on the ground
that it doesn’t possess “the confidence of
the House,” but it has no open or effective
method of indicating what kind of Cabinet
will possess the confidence of the House.
One of the most common reasons why the
Government loses the confidence of the
House is because it doesn’t make satis-
factory progress with public business,
but all the forms of Parliament appear to
be specially devised to make any serious
progress absolutely impossible. The avowed
reason for the existence of the Opposition is
to block legislation in every possible way,
and its facilities for so doing are unlimited.
In particular, it may come forward any num-
ber of times in this session with a motion
that the House is dissatisfied because the
Government doesn’t get along faster, and
may, with reasonably clever generalship,
occupy a week or a fortnight with a desultory
conversation about the delay of public busi-
ness. When the motion is disposed of, and
business shows some signs of getting started,
there is nothing to prevent it immediately
starting another long discussion about the
unprogressiveness of public business. One
of the chief reasons why no Government ever
makes reasonable progress with anything is
the time wasted in calling attention to the
fact that it doesn’t make progress. The rest
of the time is largely occupied with motions
for adjournment, and with doing all over
again business which was done in the previous
session, and then lost through being left
unfinished when the prorogation came along
and released the exhausted senators from
their labours.

A Ministry which was appointed by Par-
liament for a fixed period—which could re-
ceive definite instructions from Parliament
without being ejected and which was
directed by a Parliament which had itself
received definite instructions from the people
through the Referendum, or some similar
device which would allow the nation to give
a definite opinion, might be reasonably
expected to do something. The present
kind of Ministry can only do anything when
circumstances are unusually favorable, and
even then it does it painfully and slowly,
and to move that the country is not satisfied
with it is mere supererogation, for no country
in its senses can ■ be satisfied with any
Ministry of the present pattern. An elec-
tive Government could afford to retrench
where needed, for its acts could only be
reversed by a specific action of the House.
The member who had been turned into an
enemy because a railway hadn’t been built in
his electorate, and the one whose nephew
had been retrenched out of the public ser-
vice, and the one who hadn’t contrived to
sell a piece of land to the State 'at an
exorbitant price, could no longer pool
their grievances and get rid of the
Government under a general vote of
dissatisfaction, for the Government would be
immoveable until the expiration of its term
of office. Their only mode of redress would
be by asking the House to instruct the
Government by a specific vote to build the
railway, and buy the piece of land at an ex-
cessive value, and to find billets for the
relatives in question. And no Parliament,
with the fear of a general election before its
eyes, dare do such a thing ; also, no poli-
tician, with the prospect of a hereafter when
he next met his constituents, dare ask it to
do so. Also, there would be no more want
of confidence motions, for a Government
with a fixed billet could get along without
Parliamentary confidence. The reasons why
Australia should adopt the Referendum
and the system of elective Cabinets are
many, but the most effective reason of all
is that it would put Parliament, for the first
time, on a business like basis. It would enable
the nation to give plain instructions to its
representatives, and it would enable Parlia-
ment to carry out these instructions with
reasonable promptness, instead of being per-
petually switched off on irrelevant side-issues
and political free-fights of no public interest.
Meanwhile, at time of writing, the New
South Wales Parliament is still endeavouring
to decide whether the country is or is not
dissatisfied with the present Ministry, which
fact might as well be taken for granted and
much time and eloquence saved thereby.
The country is dissatisfied with the present
Ministry and with every other Ministry, and
with the present Parliament and every other
Parliament, and with itself, and its political
system, and with the universe and things in
general.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Squatter and Shearer—Again !
The Pastoralists’ Union “ sentence,” like
Belial’s, “is for open war.” Let Australia
mark it. Last season’s shearing was completed
at great loss to employers and employes, owing
to the strikes and lock-outs caused by the pas-
toralists’ arbitrary repudiation—without refer-
ence to the other party in the agreement—of
the platform which both parties at the ’9l Con-
ference bound themselves to observe. Outrages
and alleged outrages, assaults and reprisals,
were attributed to each side freely. In the
encounter the peace of the community was
often broken, and its prosperity interrupted.
Large additional expense was incurred by
Governments, and paid by the people. In-
tent to avoid similar hostilities next season,
if it be possible, the Workers’ Union
Conference, which sat last week at Albury,
approached the New South Wales Pas-
toralists’ Union, endeavouring to reach a
modus vivendi. The Pastoralists’ reply was to
the effect that no change of plan was" contem-
plated, no discussion of matters in dispute
could take place. The P.U. thus with a light
heart takes the responsibility of a fresh struggle
this year. It disdains compromise ; it rejects
the opportunity of reconciliation. Good. The
P.U. has the right to do all these things—the
technical right, the legal right. A man may
conduct his own business as he pleases, says the
P.U. He may, and he shall—as long as his
pleasure does not interfere with the pleasure of
the society of which he is a member. If it does,
then that man must go under. The members
of the P.U. as individuals are entitled to the
utmost license, while they proceed on lines
approved as beneficial to the whole community.
The moment they go outside those lines, their
liberty is a dead letter. This is both sound
morality and common sense. “This is a free
country,” says the P.U. It is ; and it is also
not a free country. No man is free to enslave
another, to rob another, to kill another. On a
petty scale, conduct calculated to provoke a breach
of the peace is an offence recognised at law.
The conduct of the P.U. is emphatically calcu-
lated to provoke a breach of the peace on a
grand scale. Considering all the circumstances
the organisation of the opposing parties ; the
history of the dispute; the contingencies
involved— The Bulletin believes that, in
obstinately standing on their rights as indivi-
duals, and in callously refusing to recognise
responsibilities to the community which pro-
tects those rights, the associated pastoralists—
or the coterie by which they are bossed
—are acting as enemies of the public
safety. Let them be treated accordingly.
The pastoralists claim their rights : give
them their rights. Let them have their
pound of flesh—and call them to heavy account
for every drop of blood shed. If this year also
industry is paralysed, “outrages” are reported,
the country is thrown into turmoil, then make
the pastoralists foot the bill. Man by man—
wretched ledger items that they often are !
the squatters would probably avoid the strife
if they could. It is with the force of the banka
and finance companies—the tyranny of capital,
the brutality of concentrated Eat—that Aus-
tralia has to reckon, and most of those banks
are the reconstructed legacies of ’93, kept open
only by the backing of the people’s credit, now
using the people’s credit to crush the people !
If Parliament once makes it clear that, so long
as the present attitude is persisted in, the State
is ranged on the side of Labor, and will
pitilessly exact its dues from, and utterly deny
its favors to, the opponents of Labor, the situa-
tion will change speedily and permanently for
the belter.

The Fro-trade Freetectionist.
The following letter, published in the Age, by
Alex. Caughey, a Victorian wine-grower, who
declared himself before the Tariff' Commission
a thorough-going Freetrader, but demanded
Protection for his own industry, is interesting,
as showing the average Freetrader’s attitude :
I was pleased to read in one of your leading articles in
to-day s paper your remarks on the evidence given by me
before the Tariff Commission, as it gives me the oppor-
tunity of explaining why I, as a Freetrader, can consist-
ently urge on that commission the maintenance of the
present rate of duty on foreign wines, and I will even go
further and say that if they are studying the in-
terest of the colony at large they should at the
same time abandon the duty charged on all the
appliances used in the trade, such as bottles, corks,
capsules, wine presses, wine pumps, &c. Every Govern-
ment of late years, and all the press of the colony are
unanimous in the opinion that what we want is to make
our soil so productive as to yield not only plenty of labor,
but such a surplus for remunerative export as will bring
wealth to the country—and there is no industry as yet
started amongst us which is more likely to carry out this
result. The lately-published statistics show the result
that there are at present under vines in the colony
30,275 acres, 20,118 in full bearing, and 10,157 coming for-
ward. In round numbers, an average of one man to each
10 acres is required for the tillage and gathering <>f the crop;
therefore, even in the small progress made, 3000 men are
employed in addition to the large amount of labor outside
the vineyard. The distribution of wages must, therefore,
amount to upwards of £200,000. I find that the duty col-
lected on foreign wines in the year 1893 was £10,528105. Id.
at the present duly, and in 1891, at the 6s. duty, it was
£25,846 19s. 3d., making a difference in favor of the lower
duty of £15,218 9s. 2d., and as Mr, Jackson in his evidence
pointed out this lower duty was gradually decreasing, the
question therefore arises whether it is of more importance
to the country to extend and encourage the growth of
vines and establish a permanent source of wealth and treat
foreign wines as a luxury, which even Freetraders admit
should be taxed ; or to secure fqr a few years the extra
duty which would result from the reduction, and
which itself is problematical. The vinegrowers have
no hope that the 12s. duty will increase the price of
their produce ; but, as I stated in evidence, as late presi-
dent of the Australian Wine Association and present
chairman of the Board of Viticulture, from my intimacy
for the last 25 years with the wine-growers and trade
generally, I am in a position to say that the increase in
duty has led to an increased consumption of Australian
wim s, and a general hope is expressed that a few years
will overcome all prejudice amongst local consumers.
Mr. Caughey, as a Freetrader, wants his own
industry protected because Protection—applied
to his own industry—increases production,
supplies work and wages to a vast number of
inhabitants, “ establishes a permanent source
of wealth,” and doesn’t increase the price to
the consumer. The Bulletin, as a Protec-
tionist paper, wants Caughey’s industry pro-
tected for exactly the same reasons. Only
Caughey, as a Freetrader, w r ants everybody
else’s industry to be allowed to go to perdition
in its own way on these sound Freetrade prin-
ciples, which apply to every business save his
own ; while The Bulletin, as a Protectionist,
wants to foster Caughey’s industry and every-
body else’s as well. And that is just where the
difference between Freetrade and Protection
comes in.
The Tory Wag Once More.
The audacious humor of the wag who writes
leaders for Tory dailies shows no evidence of
decline. Hoax is piled upon hoax. How far
the humor can be carried is not certain, but it
has lately prompted the Argus to the doctrine
that the minimum wage must be followed by
the State guarantee of an adequate salary to
every man in any trade or profession he chooses.
Then would the State have to find work for 40 musicians
and one cook; fora hundred poets and three laborers.
Thousands of young fellows would be watchmakers,
engravers, architects, and so on. None would be coal-
heavers, or seamen, or farm hands.
This certainly is an exquisite conception—a
community producing nothing to eat, drink or
wear, promulgating a law to supply itself out
of vacancy with the necessaries of life. The
minimum wage leads to this as surely as the
agitation against “sweating” has ultimate
regard to the wasting of jockeys. In the king-
dom of the blind the one-eyed man can wink his
other eye, and among Tories no hoax is too
childish to be believed. The minimum wage is
a temporary expedient whereby the worker is
secured a certain percentage of the fruits of his
labor. It is a temporary expedient in an age
of expediency, and will probably be scorned in
future days as a half-measure. At present
labor fetches the market-price when it should
fetch the market-value. The minimum wage is
a compromise between the two. But the agita-
tion for the compromise with injustice in the
interest of justice will not be altogether barren
if it continue to suggest further mad hoaxes on
the Tories.
The Lawyer and the Bootmaker.
William Morris, bootmaker, is a sorrowful
illustration of what may happen to a small
Democrat who opposes a large Liberal at a
Victorian Parliamentary election. The Liberal
in this case was Alfred Deakin, a friend of
the Age, and the Age variously described the
intruder as “a pledged Tory decoy duck,” a
“ Tory fox,” a “ tool of the Conservatives ” and
“a traitor,” although he was merely an ill-
advised working man who didn’t believe in
Bearin', and thought himself a more desirable
candidate than the lawyer in question. Morris
sued the mistaken newspaper for defamation of
public character. He came through his case in
a creditable manner. It was clearly shown that
he had worked 4 4 on his own,” wi th a little financial
assistance from a hotel-keeper who encouraged
struggling candidates because committee meet-
ings and election excitement are good business
for his pub. Morris was neither the decoy
duck of Tory M 4 Cracken, nor a traitor to
Deakin’s Liberal cause. However, the Age
accused the harmless man of so much per-
fidy that he called upon Mr. David Syme


“ The .Fiscal Superstition,” by Max Hirsch. Published
by E. W. Cole, of Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide.
itho day before the election offering to
retire in Deakin’s favor, and leave the question
of expenses to Deakin’s committee. There-
upon the Age proprietor telegraphed to his
friend Deakin, who wired back a refusal to
] ave any dealings with Morris. By thib time,
of course, Deakin reckoned that the small
democratic candidate had been smashed by Age
thunderbolts. David Syme thought Deakin
was unwise and would have only himself to
blame if he lost the election, yet next morning’s
Age repeated the story that Morris was run-
ning in the Tory interest. Which, coming
after the man’s hona-fide offer to merge himself
into Deakin, was surely not fair comment. A
jury of four gave Morris a verdict for one
farthing damages, instead of awarding him a
modest sum sufficient to carry costs. He has
to pay his own costs or owe them. The jury
estimated the value of Morris’s political repu-
tation by the small number of votes he obtained.
They evidently forgot to consider the damage
done to his prospects by the Age newspaper,
and they saw something ridiculous in his oppo-
sition to a fashionable Liberal of Deakin’s
calibre. It was the bootmaker’s misfortune to
be measured with Deakin and set down as a
candidate of no account. Counsel had worked
upon the jury’s weakness in this respect by
praising Deakin to the skies. Morris was the
presumptuous creature who dreamed of cutting-
out a godlike lawyer. The magnitude of his
failure dwarfed his grievance against the
journal that libelled him. The libel was con-
siderable, but the bootmaker seemed small, so
he got a farthing.
The imprisoned bank-directors are getting out
of gaol one by one. The two latest to be
released are Low and Hadfield, of the
Northumberland Banking Co., one of the ugliest
and most shameless concerns of its kind, and an
affair which about reached the climax in the
matter of cooked balance-sheets, and vanished
assets, and general disaster. The two bankers
were sentenced to seven years in gaol, and are
discharged after serving rather more than two.
The reason of their release isn’t announced, but
possibly the fact that one of them is related to
an eminently respectable bishop has something
to do with the matter. At all events, the
man not related to a bishop who is
sentenced to seven years for stealing one
broken-down horse, almost invariably puts in
his full term, and when the small criminal is
kept in so vigorously and the the large one gets
out so regularly, it suggests a very natural
inference. For the 40th time—no prisoner’s
sentence should be commuted without the fact
being announced in the Government Gazette,
together with the reasons for the commutation.
Also, the commutation of sentences
solely with a Court of Appeal, instead of
being left in the hands of politicians whose
billets depend on their pleasing Parliamentary
supporters, and constituents, and so on,
and who can be privately interviewed, and
wept over by relatives, and approached in
all manner of ways. The result of the present
system is simply that the man who has no rela-
tives, or no influential relatives, remains in
gaol for his full term, and the other man who
has important connections, or who has somebody
to weep gracefully for him in the right quarter,
doesn’t. The release of Low and Hadfield
(who is related to a bishop) may be perfectly
just; The Bulletin, not knowing the recent
history of the case, doesn’t pretend to say
that it isn’t. But, if it is, the continued incar-
ceration of many other men is an outrage.
A deputation of parsons, headed by Bishop
Thornton, waited upon Ballarat City Council
the other day to protest against the running of
Sunday excursion trains to Queenscliff, where-
upon uprose the irreverent councillor Elliott
and chided Bishop “Samuel, Ballarat,” for
breaking the Sabbath by employing his groom
and coachman on Sunday, and keeping his cook
and servants at work throughout that blessed
day. The Bishop gasped and squirmed, and
the chokered deputation goggled its eyes and
said, “ Well, it never !” and the meek and
lowly members of the Council appeared on the
verge of having fits, but the Mucked Elliott
stuck to his guns and asked again with some
heat what the gaitered and shovel-hatted gentle-
man meant by it, anyhow. At this stage the
Mayor broke in, pale and distressed, and humbly
apologised to the Bishop for “the indignity ” that
had been heaped upon him ; whereupon Dr.
Thornton blew his nose with a loud report,
looked resigned, as became a man of God, and
said, “ he at least would take no further notice
of what had taken place.” Which goes to show
that an eel isn’t in it with an unctuous parson
when it comes to M’riggling out of a tight place,
the man, bishop or otherwise, who is driven
round by a liveried minion on the day of rest,
and whose portly cook has to stew for hours
before great fires pulley - hauling the saint’s
victuals on that same day, has no manner of
right to snort at the secular individual who
rides in a train on the blessed Sabbath. It is
merely a question of the manner of breaking
the commandments, and The Bulletin contends
that in a free country every man should have
the privilege of breaking his commandments
according to his own taste and inclination, pro-
viding he is within the law. The parsons
dictate our virtue to us ; shall they dictate
our sins ?
Vic. Spectator (Wesleyan Church organ) :
A vigorous application of the lash as a punishment for
hrutal offences against the person has a most salutary
effect. Offenders of this class are almost always cowardly
mutes, who are most effectually reached through their
S , "u vvas refreshing to read in the daily papers, last
week, how the flogging of one of them in Sydney moved
nm to howls, and tears, and fervent prayers. Our own
J unkins would be all the better for a similar experience.
Hus is the Church’s rendering of “Ye have
heard that it was said, an eye for an eye, and a
tooth for a tooth; but I say unto you, resist
Rot him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth
thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
also.” Perhaps herein lies the solution of the
problem, “ Why don’t men go to church V”
Make absence a floggable offence. If the
lash will move one sinner to “ fervent
prayer ” it ought to be equally effective
. found. It is notable that your Methody
pietist does not advocate the lash for the snealj-
thief offences peculiar to his own order. When
we hear some sleek saint barracking for the cat
as above, we always think of the humorist who
sent the other fellow a libel-writ for having
called him a professional Hardshell—“ meaning
thereby a smug person who uses religion as a
cloak for robbery, and who for base purposes
inveigles trustful girls to Sunday-school pic-
nics.” Why shouldn’t the lash be applied to
the religious confidence-tricksters ? To be
tied up and partially skinned alive is even
terrible to the pugilist specially trained
to bear punishment ; but how the fear of
a flaying would oppress the alleged souls of
the broadclothed and belltoppered vessels of
grace, whose tying balance-sheets and fraudful
bank-dodgery have choked the asylums with
madmen and the rivers with suicides, and in-
creased by a thousand per cent, the hopeless,
ragged wretches who mumble to themselves as
they wander in the streets ! No; the lash is for
the man in moleskins and for the man in mole-
skins only.
Dr. Moore, R.O. Bishop of Ballarat:
We find the greatest talents and most expensive attain-
ments assooiafed in the same individual with the most
deplorable crimes. What sad examples of this class do
we see in Victoria, where religion is divorced from secular
knowledge.
Surety this is not a dig at poor, dear Matthias
Larkin, the man who embezzled South Mel-
bourne, and who was a profitable and devout
son of mother Church ! It is noteworthy, too,
that most of the boom brigands were good and
holy men, with a copious command of Scripture
and a fine pulpit style, and every superlative
rascal who makes his appearance in the dock
has a score of “respectable” witnesses —
usually including a parson or two—to attest
to his pious upbringing, and point out that he
was a regular attendant at church, and that,
consequently, his crime must have been a visita-
tion of the devil. The Victorian State school
is willing to compare criminals with the Sunday-
school, and chance it.

“ The absolute and imperative duty of the
politician was not to make laws but to find put
what laws existed and to get his individual life
and the Government of the country in which he
lived in line with those laws.” Frank Cotton’s
late “Law and Order” lecture dropped this
and other perils to the world’s common sense.
Let Judge Forbes speak, as recently at Albury :
“ That is the law, but a monstrously bad law,
and I’ll not follow it. I dismiss the appeal
with costs and you can go to the higher court if
you like, but you’ll not get me to follow such a
law.” Judge Forbes is not an extraordinarily
wise moralist, but he is quite good enough to
hit Frank Cotton with. By the way, was not
Cotton, when he delivered that lecture, under
expectation of being nominated to New South
Wales Upper House ?
The Reid Government’s manipulation of the
dissolution-bogey proves what almost all New
South Wales Governments have also proved,
that the negotiations between a Governor and
his Premier should, as regards this right to a
dissolution, be related officially to the House
before the session begins. A Premier either
has or has not the right to claim a dissolution
as part of the compact between himself and the
Governor. If he has obtained the right it
should, as a portion of the government of the
people by the people, and not by star-chamber or
backstairs courtesans, be formally made known
to Parliament as soon as members assemble.
Many good objects would be attained thereby.
If, on the other hand, a Premier has not ob-
tained the right there would be no room for
the indecent bluff with which important votes
in the House are accompanied. As it is, a
Premier’s myrmidon sets afloat a rumor to the
effect that the Governor lias granted a right to
dissolve, and Parliament has no means of ascer-
taining whether the rumor is fouudationless or
not; the Premier, as befits a situation so
stupidly undemocratic, winks or breathes hard
when asked, or by some other oracular ex-
pedient shaves the wind of mendacity. An
official declaration of the compact with the
Governor is then democratically necessary, and
especially necessary where poker-politicians are
so much in evidence.
The New South Wales Parliamentary oppo-
nents of O’Sullivan’s attempt to legally pro-
tect newspapers in the publication of accurate
reports of public meetings w r ere singularly
obtuse in the application they made of their
“ man of straw ” argument. It is conceivable
that a vicious paper might load up a “ Garden
Honey” or an “ Old Dad” with defamatory
matter and afterwards report the utterances
under shelter of O’Sullivan’s bill; but if it did
so its offence would be, not the publishing of a
libel, but conspiring to defame, or instigating a
breach of the law—a much more serious offence
than ordinary libel. A man last week, in a
Sydney court, received 10 years’ hard labor for
inciting to murder ; he was not auctioned out
or imprisoned as a debtor, but was tried and
sentenced as a criminal. Inciting to defame is
in the same category, and is no more met by
seizing the type and printing-press of the
newspaper than would inciting to murder have
been met by a fine.
The circumstances attendant on the conviction
of the lad Bonner for complicity in the burn-
ing of the steamer Rodney during the recent
New South Wales Western shearing-troubles
are simply shocking. Bonner was tried at
Wilcannia, but, the jury disagreeing, he was
brought to Sydney for a second trial. A con-
stable swore that during his incarceration at
Wilcannia —after the first trial—he obtained a
confession from accused which lie, the con-
stable, afterwards reduced to writing, but
which alleged confession prisoner did not sign,
nor was it even read over to him. Accused,
when forced into the box at the second trial,
swore that he never made the alleged confes-
sion, but had said that he wished “ the affair
settled one way or the other.” On cross-
examination he admitted that he had served a
sentence of six months for housebreaking. It
would be hard indeed to find words capable of
expressing the bad logic and cruelty of a
system under which a man, legally stockwhipped
into the box through fear of an adverse infer-
ence being drawn from his silence, is cross-
examined before conviction as to a legally-
expiated offence. Despite accused’s denial the
alleged confession had weight with the jury,
who found a verd'ct of guilty, which verdict
was accentuated by Mr. Justice Simpson, who,
notwithstanding a recommendation to mercy,
sent Bonner into penal servitude for seven
years. Bonner may be guilty, but the method
of his conviction is degrading to the popular
conception of justice.
The Reid Government (N.S. W.) complains
bitterly about being obstructed by Dibbs’s latest
motion of censure. The Reid party fired about
a dozen motions of censure at Dibbs during his
two troubled years of office, but this fact doesn’t
make it feel any better. The motion of censure,
as at present conducted, is a supremely idiotic
business anyhow. As a rule, it involves a stop-
page of all work for anywhere from three to
fourteen days, a long, desultory conversation
about everything that the present Ministry and
all previous Ministries have done or said, or left
undone or unsaid, or which they should have
said or left unsaid, or done or omitted to do,
also about people and things in general, and
about all the social and political theories under
the sun. Then both sides seek to buy up
waverers by promises of all sorts, and the
party which loses asserts, with perfect truth,
that the other party won by corrupt means,
and the party which wins says, also with
perfect truth, that the other party tried to
win by corrupt means. Also, if the Govern-
ment comes out on top, its excuse there-
after for everything it fails to do is the loss
of time caused by the other party’s merce-
nary grabbing after office. So long as Party
Government endures, motions of censure seem
unavoidable, but at all events they should be
fixed on a new basis. When notice of such a
motion is given, Parliamentary business should
go on as usual. When the motion comes on,
all debate should be prohibited. Every member
who hasn’t got leave of absence from the House,
or who isn’t represented by a doctor’s certificate
of illness, or who isn’t away being tried before a
court of law, should be required to turn up under
penalty of ,£2O fine, and at the hour fixed a
division should take place. Then after five
minutes has been allowed, so that the winning
party may hooray over its victory, business
should go straight ahead, and no more motions
of censure be allowed for at least a month.
Some stirring events are expected in Q. politics
this year. The heads of the Labor-party are
said to have at last perceived that they can
achieve nothing as long as they keep in ex-
tremes, and are casting about for a modus
vivendi with the Opposition. The defection of
the ready and plausible Kingsbury from the
Ministerial side is promised by the quid-nuncs ;
and combined L.P., Opposition, and renegades
are to present a broad Democratic programme
to the Country, which is confidently expected
to overset Nelson. Likely enough, but the
L.P. must take care it isn’t made a catspaw for
Kingsbury’s chestnuts. That lengthy schemer
is emphatically a politician to distrust, and he
would do almost anything to get into office—for
which his career and character prove him demo-
cratically unfit.
Max Hirsch’s Superstition.
“The Fiscal Superstition,” by Max Hirsch, the
travelling boomer of the Vic. importing interest,
is a small but remarkable book, devoted to prop-
ping up Max’s favorite superstition—Free-
trade. In a general way it is the Voice of Max
calling out garbled statistics in the wilderness, no
one heeding him. A circular which accompanies
the volume says that Mr. Hirsch is “ recognised as
one of the leading political economists of the
colonies,” a statement which fairly expresses the
opinion the writer appears to hold of himself ; and
in the preface, Mr. Hirsch states that his facts
“ have been carefully collected and examined and
are reliable,” and are mainly based upon
Hayter’s and Coghlan’s statistics. This is the
most interesting statement of the lot, for a
more outrageously and foolishly-garbled set of
alleged facts and figures has never come under
The Bulletin’s notice. The two things most
visible in Mr. Hirsch’s volume are its in-
accuracy and its unutterable gall. The writer’s
object is to institute a comparison between New
South Wales and Victoria. He starts apparently
on the assumption that the past good fortune of
the latter province was owing solely to borrowed
money and the boom, and its present ill-fortune is
wholly owing to Protection—the breaking of the
boom having nothing whatever to do with it.
Likewise the good fortune of New South Wales
—such as it was—is wholly owing to Freetrade ;
and borrowed money and Protection—despite the
fact that N.S.W. has borrowed even more than
Victoiia, and is now a protected province—have
no connection with the matter whatever. Then
Mr. Hirsch plunges into a mass of evidence which
is interesting, though not in the way the writer
evidently intended.
# * #
It is “absolutely ludicrous,” says Mr. Hirsch
(p. 17) to maintain that manufacturers compete with
importers. Evidently the Vie. manufacturer must
compete with somebody, for everybody competes
with somebody, but whom he competes with the
writer doesn’t profess to say. He merely dumps
down his own impossible assertion and passes on.
He quotes a number of witnesses before the Vic.
Tariff Commission who said that the prices of
goods in their lines iiad been increased by Protec-
tion, and carefully suppresses all the witnesses,
and these were not few, who attested the con-
trary. On the cement question (p, 29) he declares
that the price of cement is much higher than it
was before the duty was imposed, and on the next
page he shows that the present price, with a
heavy duty, is 11s. 6d. per cask, and that in the
old Freetrade days it ranged as high as 16s. On
page 32 he points out that the Vic. price of reaper
and binder twine, which pays duty, hasfallen 47per
cent, in five years, while (page 36) seaming twine,
which pays no duty, has fallen only 33 per cent,
in 28 years, and then he calmly calls attention to
this” as an example of the special cheapness of
Freetrade. Apparently, this is done on the off-
chance that his readers won’t check the calcula-
tion. Also, his figures inadvertently show that the
dutiable reaper and binder twine is now much
cheaper than it was before the duty was imposed,
and he states that “during the season 1893-94 the
price of best Manilla twine was 6d. in Tasmania
(where there is no duty) as against Bd. in Victoria.”
Seeing that on the same page the 1894 price in
Victoria is quoted at 5Jd. instead of Bd., this
requires considerable assurance.
• * *
There are in Victoria, says Hirsfch (page 14),
only one ammunition and cartridge factory (six
according to Hay ter of 1893, pp. 276-279),
one paper mill (Hayter says there are two),
one dynamite factory (six according to Hay-
ter), one salt works (Hayter finds four), one
varnish factory (Hayter reports two), and one
candle works (Hayter alleges that there are 33).
I rotection, Hirsch alleges (page 39), has raised
wheat freights to London from 21s. Bd. in 1890 to
255. 7jd. in 1894. As V ictoria was protected for
20 years before 1890 it is quite as fair to assume
that it was Protection which reduced freights to
the unprecedented 21s. Bd. in the first place, but
Max suppresses this view of the case. He also fails
to mention that freights have also risen in the
other provinces—in fact, he flatly denies this. Pro-
tection, he says (page 39), has increased Vie. rail-
way freights also, which statement requires a con-
siderable amount of nerve, in the face of the re-
ductions made at various times for a good many
years past. “Itis a well-know n fact,” says Max,
“that two engines and two trucks now cost the
Department as much as three engines and three
trucks would cost under Freetrade conditions.”
Considering that all Government imports are free
of duty, and that Hirsch asserts that Protection
has reduced wages, the Vic. Government does work
under 1 reetrade conditions, but Max, seemingly,
isn t aware of his own discrepancy. Also, he
gives no figures or evidence whatever—merely bald
assertion. He further asserts (page 40): “that
railway freights are lower in N.S.W. than
Victoria is a notorious fact.” According to
Hayter (page 157), Victorian freights are lower
than those of N.S.W., and Hirsch’s statement has
been so often disproved that it badly wants
some reliable figures to support it. Protec-
tion, says the same gifted writer (page 41),
has killed the Victorian meat-preserving and
fellmongering industries. Hayter (page 270)
reports the fellmongering business as being
in full blast, but this doesn’t matter much.
On page 47, Hirsch announces that Freetrade
N.S.W., which had 9000 less factory operatives
than Victoria in 1888 and 10,000 less in 1890, had,
in 1893, actually 1100 more, and he points to this
as a proof that it is Freetrade, not Protection,
which builds up manufactures. The astonishing
Max actually professes not to know that N.S.W.
was a protected country when she thus got ahead
of her old-time enemy. Also, he points out (page
49) that Victoria includes as a factory any place,
regardless of the number of employes, where opera-
tions are carried on by steam or mechanical
power, and thereby swells her returns, but he
entirely suppresses the fact (Hayter, page 281) that
on this swelled basis Victoria employed 88,000
persons in factories, against N.S.W.’s 75,000.
That is to say, he seemingly reckons in his table
only the number of persons employed in factories
as the term is defined by law, while professing to
reckon all persons employed in factories, using the
word in the largest and widest sense. Further,
Hirsch’s Victorian figures for 1892 are seemingly
Hayter’s figures for 1893, and for 1888 he seems to
have tacked nearly 6000 non-existent operatives
on to Hayter’s figures, apparently through ignor-
ance, or else from a desire to make the subsequent
fall seem all the more violent. Also, his 1891 figures
appear to be Hayter’s figures for ’92, and he com-
pares the 1891 figures for N.S.W. with the 1892
figures for Victoria, and produces strange and
dreadful results thereby.
* * *
On page 45 the talented Hirsch gives a state-
ment of the exports and imports of Victorian and
N.S.W. native produce for a series of years,
showing that the Freetrade province is enor-
mously ahead of its Protectionist rival. The
export figures for N.S.W. have been taken with
tolerable accuracy from an ancient Customs return
a more recent one by Coghlan, which reduces some
of them considerably, has been carefully avoided.
Ihe Victorian figures, however, when compand
with Hayter’s figures (Hayter for ’93, page 69).
look as if Mr. Hirsch had deducted .£1,500,0(0
to £3,000,000 each year—at all events, about
-£25,000,000 has been knocked off the Vic. ex pot t;
in ten years, and a beautiful case for Freetrade
has thus been constructed. Whether the imports
are equally inaccurate The Bulletin doesn’t
know, not having the official figures available at
the moment. The Vic. soil, says the “Fiscal
Superstition ” man (page 51), is “richer and more
fertile than that of N.S. W. Coghlan’s agii-
cultural statistics (“Seven Colonies” for 1894,
pp. 191-217) show the exact contrary, but
Max Hirsch probably knows a lot more than
Coghlan.
• • •
( On page 50 Hirsch announces that, in 1893, New
South Wales “employed 44,757 more laborers”
than Victoria. Coghlan (page 248 of the “Seven
Colonies”) reports that Victoria, with a smaller
population, finds work for 7000 more males and
18,000 more females, but Hirsch, apparently,
makes his own statistics as already mentioned.
On page 56 he says that the protective period in
Victoria was from ’73 to ’93, and on page 58, when
it is convenient to fix things differently to support
a new batch of statements, he puts down
the beginning of “ effective ” Protection at
the year 1880. He understates (page 58) the
cultivated area of New South Wales in 1880
by 4000 acres and overstates it in 1890 by 250,000
acres (Coghlan’s Statistical Register, 1892), and
thereby swells the alleged increase in N.S.W.
under Freetrade by 254,000 acres. This is
managed by including fallow land in 1890,
and carefully leaving it out in 1880. Then
he goes on to point out that Freetrade booms
agriculture in a truly remarkable fashion. In a
comparative list of wages he takes the N.S.W.
rates from the Government statistics, but instead
of taking the Victorian rates from the same
reliable authority—which would utterly blast his
argument that Protection pays lower wages than
Freetrade—he gets the latter set of figures from
“careful personal enquiry.” Any kind of figures
can be got by careful personal enquiry, provided
the enquirer is sufficiently careful to enquire of the
person who will give him the figures he wants. He
omits all figures showing the enormous (protected)
agricultural production of Victoria. He persists, on
every occasion, in ignoring the fact that N.S.W.
is a protected country, and insists on regarding
it as purely Freetrade. He produces a cloud of
garbled numerals to show that Vic. manufactures
are steadily declining, while those of N.S.W. are
increasing and are far ahead of her neighbour’s,
and he peacefully drops the fact that the value
of Vic. manufactures is =£22,000,000, for the
latest year where returns are available, against
a total of .£16,000,000 for N.S.W. Wherever The
Bulletin has taken the trouble to check Mr.
Hirsch’s figures it has found him hopelessly wrong
—whether purposely wrong, or wrong through
mere ignorance, bigotry, and arithmetical in-
capacity, it doesn’t pretend to know. But, as a
“leading political economist,” Max should now
take a back seat for the rest of his life.

A careful study of “ The Fatal Card,” at
Sydney Royal, leaves various impressions on the
miml, the first of these being that Haddon
Chambers and partner wrote their drama on a
sticky wicket, so to speak, and that the bowling
was shamefully uneven. Taking one considera-
tion with another, the good points of the piece
outnumber the bad ones, but still there are several
bad ones, and they stick out conspicuously. The
first and most glaring anachronism is the pivot on
which the whole play turns. In the first act, the
honorable Colorado villain, when he parts with
the hero—who has just saved his life—tears up a
card and gives him half of it so that they may re-
cognise each other when they meet again. They
are perfectly well acquainted, but the whole story
would be spoiled if they agreed to recognise each
other by sight in the ordinary way. So when the
same>orowd is thrown together again in England,
though the other people know each other readily
enough, the hero and the honorable villain—this
is to distinguish him from the crawlsome villain—
who have hardly changed in the least, meet over
and over again without a gleam of recognition.
• * #
Out of six people who led a wild, sinful
life in Colorado, two recognise a third one without
difficulty, and three know two of the crowd at
first sight, and one spots another as soon as he
sees her, but the people with the torn card about
them are blankly oblivions. Then, when Cosgrove
goes stealthily into an office to chloroform an old
man, he carries his luggage in a bag instead of
having it ready, and has to unfasten the bag and
get out the handkerchief, and uncork the chloro-
form, and pour it over the rag while he stands
behind his victim. Only the most patient kind of
victim would wait to be chloroformed in this
fashion. Also, the most interesting character in
lie drama walks out of it in act 4, and isn’t again
heard of.
• • »
Still, there is a good deal of novelty, much
fine scenery, and a lot of thrill in the “Fatal
Card.” It includes a lynching scene in Colorado,
a grateful and gentlemanly villain and a muddy
kind of ruffian named Jim, who acts under his
orders, a brutal and picturesque murder, an
explosion which blows a cottage to atoms
and buries Albert Norman among the ruins,
and a scene in which a demented poetess
takes away Bland Holt’s clothes and leaves
him naked behind a tree, in which situation he
declares his love to a lady through a knot-hole
and is accepted. The dialogue is very clever in
places, especially in those places where the leading
villain holds forth to Jim, and frankly states his
opinion of that pasty-looking character, and the
plot is ingenious, barring the discrepancies already
mentioned.
* * •
The new drama is staged in a fashion which
is even more lavish than usual, and the oast doesn’t
contain one character of any importance who calls
for just execration. Bland Holt and Baker are
both excellent. Albert Norman as the picturesque
villain, and Cosgrove as the pasty ruffian of
hog-like instincts, are commendable, and Scot
Inglis—who has little to do save wear an Irish
accent and worship the ground on which Miss
Hilda Spong treads with her adorable little feet—
does both satisfactorily. Also, he makes a bril-
liant retreat just before the explosion, and retreats
right out of the story. Miss Hilda Spong makes
Albert Norman’s saintly daughter a thine
of light and loveliness generally ; and
the bad woman, by Miss Vivienne, is
a powerful and picturesque character. To save
space, apparently, the bad woman goes into the
next room to take off her hat in Act 4 and never
returns, and her absence in the explosion scene—
where she ought to weep over Norman’s dead
body—is a thing to be regretted. Mrs. Bland
Holt, who doesn’t properly belong to the drama,
fills the part of a pretty little woman with much
success, and the demented poetess, and a few
subsidiary persons, can pass muster. The point
on which the “ Fatal Card ” gets ahead of the
ordinary melodrama is the dialogue, which is dis-
tinctly above the average. Also, the curtain
always falls on an effective climax. The ordinary
melodramatist’s idea of an effective climax is
generally a dead body, and in this respect Cham-
bers and Co. are a pleasing exception to the usual
rule.

The revival of the “Second Mrs. Tan-
queray” at Sydney Lyceum only differed from
the original production of a year ago ip two par-
ticulars. Cecil Ward took the part of Capt.
Ardale, in place of the exited Renouf ; and Dor-
rington filled the character of George Orreyed—
who mjght be called Horrid for fhort—formerly
occupied by the gifted Cecil. The first change
was decidedly for the better, for Mr. Ward does
excellent work in his one brief appearance. The
second is, at all events, not a change for the worse.
The drill ky baronet has little to do save stack
himself in a ridiculous attitude on the sofa, and
Dorrington’s great wilderness of limbs lends itself
naturally to the attitude. Also, he has to stumble
out of the room in a bad state of intoxication, and
Dorrington-s fuddled rush for the door is a brief
and hurried work of art. Mrs. Brough’s Paula
lanqueray has, possibly, gained a little in in-
tensity since her first appearance in the character;
at all events her rendering of the fated
courtesan, who dies of her first and last
attempt to go straight and of the misery which
results thereby, was a tragedy which could hardly
be improved upon in the smallest particular.
Especially it reached high-water mark in the
last scene of all, where Paula looks into thefuture
and sees herself old and wrinkled and painted and
false-haired and decked with shop-teeth, having
abandoned the attempt to live down her old reputa-
tion, and with nothing to do save moulder and
think of the festive, sinful past. When she and
litheradge sat together on their two chairs and
wailed over this unspeakable future, even the d.c.
-—yes, even the Sydney Lyceum d.c. !!!! —stopped
all conversation and listened in dead and awful
silence. Titheradge was as good as ever, and the
same strikingly original remark applies likewise
to Dot Boucicault and Misses Temple and Noble,
• * •
On Friday (March 8) Mrs. Brough takes a
benefit, and the ever-popular “Niobe” will be
staged for the occasion. Then the beneficiaire
leaves for England on a holiday of uncertain
duration, and under these circumstances Friday
nights performance at the Lyceum should be a
stupendous function, and if there is one vacant
seat, or one vacant patch of standing-room, it will
be a reflection upon the character of Australia.
Mrs. Brough has played continuously in this
country for 10 years ; she has tilled an immense
number of characters in comedy, tragedy, drama,
opera, and other things as well, and has filled all
of them well, and most of them still better; and
she has probably given the community a larger
amount of refined pleasure and unalloyed satisfac-
tion than any other lady on the Australian stage,
t herefore The Bulletin bespeaks for her an en-
thusiastic farewell, and asks the d.c. to make as
little noise as possible with its feet and large
mouth when it comes in late as usual.

Jones’ “-Masqueraders ” will be staged at

M'elb. Bijou was somewhat crowded on
Saturday, when “Esther Sand raz ” came up for
consideration. So the star of the Dacres would
seem to befin the ascendant. “ Either Sandraz ”
is Sydney Grundy’s warning to men who marry
lawful youqg wives for money, after having lost
their hearts to unlawful loves. Here the badly-
treated mistress is a Spanish lady, with a deep
regard for her protector until she gets left. Then
she registers a vengeful oath. By means of old
letters, Esther forces herself into the new home of
their author, and insists upon acting as companion
to his wife. In many ways, and under particu-
larly stagey circumstances, the vindictive Spaniard
causes trouble. She is the sin that finds the gentle-
man out, the blight which settles upon his respect-
able life, the black chicken that comes home to
roost. Having made her ex-lover sorry for him-
self, suspicious of his virtuous wife, and sick of
everything, the intruder is suddenly brought to
see the error of her vengeance. A good young
man lectures Esther into a penitent state, and she
would probably enter a nunnery if the worried
husband didn’t shoot her in mistake for the good
young man. After which regrettable error the
husband rushes into the next room, and is heard
slaughtering himself with firearms as the curtain
drops.
* • •
“Esther Sandraz” is a good acting plav,
and a difficult play to suit with a company.
Thoroughly well acted in all parts, it might prove
a big Success, but neither this nor any other Dacre
production will flourish much under the present
system of treatment. Frank Cates is out of his
depth again, and one of the imported ladies seems
much too weak to give him any assistance.
Arthur Pacre is excellent in curt remarks and
minor details. Sometimes his mouthing of
passionate speeches, or his London Journal
legs, cannot be commended. As soon as Mr
D. strives hard for effect he becomes highly
artificial and ineffective. Fortunately the
story finds a cheerful little place for William
Elton, and that valuable comedian fills it happiiy .
also Miss Kate Bishop, in a grey wig and a minor
capacity, is a welcome addition to the company.
The performance of Miss Amy Roselle is the
work of a really great artist who has found a
strong subject. Esther Sandraz, a melodramatic
creation, seems a natural, unaffected woman on
the Bijou stage. The audience allowed itself
to te considerably carried away by Esther’s
feelings on S iturday night, and on one occasion a
bookmaker was detected in the act of stealing his
h’apron to his h’eye.

An American musical farce was announced
for VVednesday night and Horace Wheatley’s
benefit at the Princess’s, the manner of the adver-
tisement being quiet and reseived. “MTntyre’s
Flirtation ’’ is no doubt running for three conse-
cutive nights if it doesn’t fall flat at its first
attempt. The Bulletin has learned to put no
blind trust in American comedies, with or without
music, and although there are but two extra dates
to fill with MTntyre aforesaid, it isn’t safe to
reckon on MTntyre appearing more than once.
On the other hand, this bold experiment may
answer remarkably well. A definite change of
bill happens on Saturday. “The New Boy ”
(from Sydney) is to usher in a new series of Living
Pictures, and Melbourne looks forward to the
occasion with a sparkling eye.

Re the Dancing Gearl’s charity entertain-
ments, at Melbourne Bijou, it is asserted that the
“ expenses ” were abnormally heavy. The local
Herald says most emphatically that from the
business aspect of the affair the arrange-
ments were entirely unsatisfactory.” The
same ridiculous journal shrieks, “inasmuch
as the entertainments were advertised as in aid of
charities, and the public had been attracted by
such advts., the financial result was surely a
matter of public importance.” The truth about
those three awful performances at the Bijou is as
follows : An earl who, on his own statement, had a
mad desire to act, and couldn’t presume to act on
his own merits, was easily persuaded to act on the
merits of charity.
• # *
The manager who made arrangements
with the verdant nobleman had the theatre’s in-
terests at heart—“charity” was only the catch-
word, as far as he was concerned. The earl had
his own gratification at heart— “ charity ” was his
excuse. The public (snobs for the most part)
paid their money to gaze at the performing
earl, and the word “charity” didn’t draw
sixpence to the house. Consequently the receipts
are of no public importance at all! Entertain-
ments, said to be in aid of charities, did actually
aid those charities to the extent of .£BO or .£lOO
apiece. If they aided anything else over and
above the charities, it is no business of the public
that went to see the Gear], expecting to witness
a bad amateur performance, and yet had not the
pluck to laugh at his lordship.

few years since, he made a speech in one of the public halls

The married actress or entertainer who sticks to her

A little Melb. weekly essayed to treat the Dancing
Gearl’s complaint with criticism and grease mixed, but
they wouldn’t mix. “As an actor, the Earl of Yarmouth
shows no skill, even for an amateur. That he has talent
is easily discernible from the earnestness with which he
throws himself into his work, and endeavors to forget his
own individuality in that of the character.” Histrionic
talent, in an earl, is expressed by his earnest manner of
accomplishing an awful failure.

London Sketch says of Gov. Robinson’s opera, “ Preda-

make a splash because a Governor wrote it, but certainly
not on its own merits.
Marie Luella and Lucy Fraser, who boast by far the
shapeliest figures on Melb. Princess’s stage, wage a rivalry

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
It has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback—the tendency to
heat tahe blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection ; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who makes
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.
Plimmer’e dramatic _oo., touring N.S.W. back-blocks
gome time ago, didn't bring back much coin ; but they
brought back a new bush epithet, which is better. Two
of the ladies turned into bed in their canvas-partitioned
room one nlght,and overheard the following conversation
b tween two bushmen next door : “Been to the play?”
“Yes.” “ What dii you think of the girls?” “ Oh, not
too stink." “ Well, good night." “G'-night.” In the
morning the ladies, much impressed, made enquiries, and
learned that they were classed as not too bad, decent
enough, pretty tolerable.
Bush strollers are all “at Poverty Point’’—all struggling
to make an honest living out of the public—all bound in
links of brotherhood. An “advance” recentlv struck a
N.S.W. bush-town three days before the races. A man
eyed him curiously as he came out on the verandah
after tea, then walked up and spoke. “Here for the
races?" “Yes.” “ What’s your line?" “I’m repre-
senting So-and-So.’s Grand Comedy and Dramatic Co.”
“Oh, ay. I’m three-card myself. Come and have a

Herr Von der Mehden, first of Ohiarini’s, then of the
Faust Family, now of Fitzgerald Bros., is the “ power-
fullest” cornet player in Australia and withal the sweetest.
His range is from a pianissimo as fine as the squeak of a
mouse to a fortissimo as loud as a tornado or an outdoor
political speech. Born in Hamburg, he started as a
drummer-boy in a military academy and learned to play
the drum and speak the truth, lie plays all band instru-
ments, violin and piano. He married one of the charming
Faust girls. He has been a big attraction with his baud
during Fitzgerald’s Maoriland tour.
Old Billy Jones, of Fitzgerald's circus—he was a veteran
even in the days of Burton—was apprenticed to St. Leon
and made his first appearance at Sofala. The circus-tent
consisted of side vvalls only, and the lights were made of
fish-tins filled with mud and some fat and rags in the
centre. These were stuck around outside the ring. The
show was carried round on packhorses. Billy Jones’ first
appearance was when he was “ carried ” round by a rider
standing up on a horse. The rider had tights, but Billy
was dressed in a trousers and shirt and was barefooted. A
large sum of money was thrown into the ring as a reward
for his pluck by the diggers of the Turon. Later on, in
Melbourne, £lOOO was offered to St. Leon for the hoy and
polity by a speculator. St. Leon replied: “No, we
haven’t got to slavery out here yet.” Billy Jones is now
53, and can still carry a very large corporation over in a
neat back somersault. He married at 52. He is the
Parkes of Australian circus-life.

plays. No one took the trouble to read them, but they
were condemned as immoral because they were published

Tennyson Cole is now married—his first wife having

At an up-country hotel, harpist Barker and flautist Lem-

For the first time since the hideous and strictly
indecent crinoline went out of fashion, an actress has
appeared in a London sassiety play wearing hoops. She
represented a country dame of the 1780 period, but not
for long, because the play, “Guy Domville,” was such a
black frost that it helped to put ice on the Thames. It
seems that when leading man George Alexander said, “ I
am the last of the Domvilles,” a disgusted first-nighter
cried, “Thank Gawd for thatl" from the gallery. An-
other proof that dramatists are born, not made; for
Henry James’ novels are full of delicate high comedy,
which seems only to need concentration for the stage. | |

Dear Bulletin, That sraall-keg-of-

cessfully in Melbourne, but with this difference —
you could tap it in any part and the nectar would

the neck kept outside the bung-hole whilst it was
Ailed with water, tied and dropped; the same

Some spirit was then poured in, and buyers

phenomenal.— Expert.
The more modern luxuries and necessities
of civilised life are taking permanent root in Mel-

all blemishes and defects. The rooms of the

Britain’s trade methods, says Wilson of the
Investors’ Review, consist mostly in selling goods to
foreign countries and lending the purchasers the money
to pay for them. Britain’s trade booms most in the
years when she lends most money abroad, and the biggest
boom is always with the countries which did the biggest
borrow.
The Sydney Permanent Freehold Land and
Building Co., reconstructed in 1891, pro pus s 1,0 recon-
struct some more. The half-year's deposit interest, fall-
insj due on 24th March, is to lie paid in six half-yearly
instalments, the first instalmnt falling due on 24th
Sept., 95, and the last in March, ’9B. Any person
who has £lOO on deposit,' at 5 per cent., will
thus receive Bs. 4d. each half-year for the next
three years. Depositors are also to be asked to
forego all of the next two years’ interest, and afterwards
to accept 2| instead of 5 per cent, in full of all claims.
At some date in the dim future, when all the co.’s mort-
gages have been paid off, it proposes to start liquidating
its deposits by instalments, parable at no defined
intervals, of Is. in the £. The hoard acknowledges regret-
fully that all its reserve and contingency funds have
been swallowed up, that the income shows a dimiirntion
of £4579 ns compared with last year, and that there is a
heavy debit balance (some £9000) with which to start the
new year. The co. owes £154,000 to depositors, so the
two years’ interest it proposes to omit paying is just
£15,400, and the reduction to 2j per cent, will mean a
saving of £3850 annually.

In Great Britain every joint-stock co. has to file
an annual statement—accessible to any one on payment
of Is.—showing thepaid-up capital, the number of shares
held by each shareholder, and the calls paid or in arrear
by each individual holder. Some such law is badly wanted
in Australasia. When a director makes a “rallying
speech” to the shareholders of a shaky affair they waiitto
be able to find out whether he is selling his shares, and is
simply trying to hold the concern together long enough
to prevent him being put on a “ B ’’ list of contribmo ies.
They also want to know whether the directors pay up their
own calls, whether they hold the requisite number of
shares to qualify them to sit on the hoard—which they
often forget to do, and to be able to gauge the solidity of
the concern by the unanimity with which the board is
trying to get out. Only when the English law is applied
in Australia it must be enacted that payment of c dls fry
uncollected cheque, or by pro. note, or by overdraft, or
by the co. discounting a hill for the shareholder, do sn’t
count. Unless it is specially stated that the influential
director has paid his calls in cash, that personage will still
find a way of getting out.

Moreton Frewen, the apostle of bi-metallism, is
not logical. In Melbourne, before the Vic. Banking Com-
mission, he advocated a State issue of notes payable in
silver, but objected to a State Bank, because “ a State
issue of notes, unsecured, inflated prices, increased im-
ports, and drove gold abroad.” The notes issued by a
State Bank would do that if they had a forced circulation,
but as it is not proposed to give them a forced circulation
they wouldn’t. Also, if a note which is secured by the
State’s promise to pay gold for it worth 20s. to the sove-
reign is going to, depreciate in this dreadful manner,
what is going to prevent the depreciation of a note which
is secured by the State’s equally reliable, or equally un-
reliable, promise to pay it in silver worth only 4d. or sd.
in the shilling?

Dear Bulletin, —Hundreds of Bulletin
readers in Victoria will sniff the musty odor of the
“Early Days” Trade Protection Society men in your
correspondent, “J.8.C.” Methinks I see that dear old
“J.8.C.” munching his stump of a penholder whilst
ladling out to subscribers his threadbare formulas, “fair
risk,” “no good,” “use caution,” &c. That sort of
thing, aided by the owl-like and sapient look he assumed,
used to go down, seven or eight years ago, and he, poor
soul, imagines that Melbourne business-men of to-day are
to be humbugged in the same way. In his time, one
clerk, at £1 a week, used to potter arou d town
with one or two enquiries, and return, after seeing, per-
haps, two or three men, with a report “fair risk” for so
and so—which with “ J.8.C.” used to hold for ever. Nowa-
days, the live enquiry offices have half-a-dozen bright men
apiec l w fl o daily visit every merchant, get the amount of
trader’s indebtedness all round, and with the knowledge as
to what the trader’s capital is and the credits he hasopened,
regulate further credits accordingly. On “J.8.0.’5” old
system (as he well knows) many rocky men did establish
£6OO credit on an original £5O recommendation, hut it
can't be done now! So far as go the “lists J.8.C.”
refers to, nearly every big firm does not read them, but
relies on the information received from the society con-
taining all the details such lists profess to afford. Had
“J.8.C.” riot been buried alive for the last few years he
would find that the scanty details he used to give sub-
scribers, and on which he made money, would at the pre-
sent day be ridiculed. He would be paralysed to see the
able and deep reports which the mo lern information-
office supplies for about half the money he used to get for
comparative guess-work.— Vosnibara.

Tiger Inglis, M.P., of Sydney, must be doing
pretty well in England. Not, only has he practically
floated the Sydney Harbor (Cremorne) Colliery Co. for
£500,000, of which £325,000 was underwritten last week,
but he seems to have had his finger in several rather pro-
fitable Westralian pies. Tiger is taking a big contract—
that of raising coal from the bottom of a half-mile
straight sh ift—and it’s to be hoped he will succeed in
making it pay. By the way, when Sydney is able to tip
coal from the pit’s mouth into the ship’s bunkers New-
castle will be a “back number.”

Small lots of jewellery and other valuable goods
sent from Sydney to North Queensland don’t pay duty, as

The dealer often carries them inhis personal luggage, and

Just now, when openings for the “profitable

A Sydney money-lender who advanced .£lOO to
a well-connected visitor from Northern Europe, now

Mein country would put you in gaol for such charges. I
vont forward ze papers unless you strike dat out. Mein
Government vould say Australia was not suitable for a
civilised consul if it saw dese figures. Strike dem out,

which, from an Australian money-lender’s point of view, is
exceedingly moderate.

The Sydney branch of a big foreign bank has
brought its clerks back to work more than once on recent
Sundays. The Sunday before last nine clerks were at
work in the morning, and five or six in the afternoon.
Yet the general manager is a great stickler for Sabbath
observance, and, although several of the clerks who have
been working on Sundays “graft” on week-nights until
10 o’clock, that manager would probably hold up
his hands in horror if he heard of them having a Sunday
picnic down the harbour by w.ay of a freshener. For, ye
ken, Sawbath jaunts are avoidable affairs, but Sawbath
work is sometimes an imperative necessity.

deposits to hear 5 per cent, interest. Only three short
years ago the Sydney and Suburban was an imposing con-
cern with £lOO,OOO paid-up capital and reserves. Now a
few more such years as ’94 may possibly make it a matter
of some difficulty to pay even the 5 per cent, on the

Editor Bulletin,—Under date of Feb. 23rd
you publish a leader in which you stigmatise Belgian
spirit as “a vile compound.” As the representatives of
one of the two disHllers who alone export spirit from
Belgium (namely, Mr. Louis Meeus, whose brand, the
“ Key and Wheat Sheaf,” is well-known, while the other,
the “Bell Brand” of Van den Berg, is also highly
esteemed), we must ask you to correct your statement.
The Geneva mentioned above is the only Belgian spirit
exported to N.S. Wales, and, although the original cost of
distilling does not exceed Is. per gallon, the same as the
Dutch Geneva, sold all over the world, yet the spirit is
distilled from good wheat, barley', and rye, and is
absolutely pure and vvho'esome. The case.of 4 gal. proof is
sold actually in bond, at Sydney, for9s. 6d., yet no one can
say that it is either impure spirit or in any way injurious
to public health. We must ask you, in all fairness, to
publish this letter to disabuse the public on this matter.—

Certain English and German firms now supply
in quantities blank invoice forms for all the leading ex-
port firms of the world, and any invoice forms not kept in
stock are made to order. They are exact duplicates of
the real article, and are very cheap. Thus, when the im-
porter gets his genuine invoice he can himself make out
the bogus one at reduced rates for the Customs. This
saves a lot of trouble. Some exporting firms don’t care
to supply bogus invoices. Sometimes the bogus invoice
goes astray, and even if it doesn’t there are too many
people in the secret. Also, the man who makes out a
bogus invoice in England dm sn’t know how to make it
suit the situation. Sometimes a whole invoice which is
judiciously “faked” to save £3OO in duty is useless
because it contains one small line of goods at an absurdly
low rate, and another firm has been bowled out the week
before passing sham invoices for the same class of goods,
and the Customs authorities are on the look-out accord-
ingly. Always make out your own bogus invoice.

A salesman of a wholesale firm, whose resigna-
tion was suggested and accepted, armed himself with gilt-
edged lettens of introduction and recommendations from
bankers and merchants, and took a trip ’Ome in search of
agencies. By these means he secured the sole agencies of
some twelve firms at a salary of £5O each per annum and
commission on sales —the agreement being, in nearly all
eases, for five years. As his office expenses are under
£lOO a year, and biz. is at zero, he is able to take his ease

To-day its annual rent is £3OO. But the rent of a certain

The first raid ever made by the Vic. railway
authorities upon passengers travelling on “Croak "tickets

Only two, however, were prosecuted. As to yearly rail

once, inasmuch as the tickets are made of the same metal
every year and the inscription on them is very small.

The Garangula (N.S.W.) goldfield offers some
more beautiful results of private ownership in mineral
land. The owners now d -maud from the men 10s. per

for gold is successful or not their profit is secure. In
addition, they are demanding hack-rent alleged to be due,
and threaten if it is not paid to treat the miners as
trespassers. Apparently the recently-passed Mining on
Private Property Act cannot help the men, who have no
option but to pay—or go. Why on earth the minerals

merely pays the Crow for its surface-value is a question
that Australian legislatures might set themselves to

N.S.W. Mines Minister Smith is now consider-

in the Bathurst region, and appears to be a very valuable
property containing several rich reefs. The tangle arises
out of complications connected with the Mining on Pri-
vate Property Act, and much curiosity is expressed in a
wide circle concerning the Minister's decision.

Most annoying. The people who thought that confidence

Drill and Rackarock Co., Sydney. Dear Sirs, —
Since 1889 I have used a very large quantity of
Rackarock in this mine, and find it to be the
safest and most economical explosive I have yet
used. One great feature in the use of Rackarock
is the absence of noxious fumes, which adds con-
siderably to the health and comfort of those

feet, blemishes and the other outward and visible
signs of change and decay vanish before the touch

that this is science—not quackery. Mr. Guest
has already established a considerable reputation
for his many artistic specialties of the toilet.

The trouble always terminates in smoke ;
We have surely had enough
Of this hanky blanky bluff.
For we view the whole proceeding as a joke.

follow the use of the thousands of “ All-failing ”
remedies so freely advertised. The reputation,
and wide spread use of Clements Tonic andl
Fletcher’s Pills are the greatest proofs of their
appreciation by the public. If they were not as:
represented they would have passed out of memory

disputed supremacy. Listen to no argument from
interested parties ; demand the genuine articles

APPEARANCES ARE DECEITFUL.
When the Duchess of M —th saw for the first
time the celebrated author of “ Vanity Fair,” who
was a very stout man, she exclaimed, “ How
deceitful appearances are; I would have thought
Mr. Thackeray thin, whose satires are so sharp.”
This remark on the inconsistency of his looks
with his writings being reported to W.M.T., he
shrugged his shoulders and said, with a smile,
“ Her ladyship ought to know, however, that my
weight is no joke when I sit on anybody. ” Appear-
ances are deceitful, arid to judge from them alone
is sometimes a mistake. Frossard’s Cavour Cigars
are the best illustration of the old saying. Rough,
in appearance and shape, they are a mild and most
delicate aromatic smoke. Packets of eight soldi

It is delightful to watch Vic. Chief Justice
Madden on the Bench. He divides his attentions
equally between his moustache and the case before

distressing tendency to hang down. The great
Chief Justice is therefore obliged to devote half
his judicial energies to keeping his hair in curl.
The death of Mrs. Booth, widow of the
long-deceased Rev. Caleb Booth, in Melb., may be
a reminder of an extraordinary occurrence. A
Melb. morning paper devoted a leading article to
enlarging on an account of how, during the ser-
vice at Northcote Church one Sunday, he came
down in his surplice from the pulpit, took up an
offending dog, and snapped its leg. The affair
proved to be much exaggerated, and only served
to bring out the well-known character of Mr,
Booth for gentleness and courtesy,
Maoriland parodies the facts connected
with the late King Lear’s ante-mortem property
distribution. In this case the victim is a very old
resident, .who made over his property to his wife.
He is now over 70, and has lived at a hotel for 14
years, having been evicted from his palatial man-
sion. He is hale and hearty, eats porridge three
times a day, enjoys circuses, and never “ took on”
about his discomfiture like the lamented Lear did.
He gets an annual allowance of £4OO out of his
estate, which is said to be worth £6OOO a year.
John Stuart Blackie, dead at 85 and a bit,
was no goose, though far from the swan that he
swam out to be. He had a vast, heterogeneous
intellect, akin to some Maoriland hot-springs—
always seething and bubbling, and belching forth
now and again a geyser of Greek or Gaelic not
unmixed with mud. He wrote a great deal, and
nothing memorable ; but he was always a subject
of profound Scotch admiration, which never
heeded the critical laughter that, outside his own
borders, greeted his riotous rhodomontade.
Ex-Justice Manning, Chancellor of Sydney
University, is dead at the age of 84. He was an
Englishman, called to the Bar in 1827, and had
lived in Australia 57 years. He was for five
years a member of the old N.S.W. Legislative
Assembly, and was Attorney-General of the first
Responsible Ministry in 1856. Half-a-century
ago he was offered and declined the resident
Judgeship in Port Phillip, and he could have
been a N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge many
years before he finally accepted the position-
in whioh, not being a lawyer of the first flight,
he was only a moderate success. His lack of
aggressiveness, to say nothing of his absolute
clean-mindedness and scorn of trickery, prevented
him from achieving what is called distinction
in local politics; but, as a kindly and honor-
able gentleman, he was revered by all who
ever knew him. His fine sense of honor caused
him to voluntarily sacrifice himself for years in
the discharge of a pecuniary obligation incurred
by another, and for which he was in no sense
legally liable ; and other grievous burdens not of
his own making he bore uncomplainingly. He
was one of the rare men who grow more liberal
with age; and last year, when all the strength of
Tory capitalism in N.S.W. Legislative Council
was arrayed against the Mining on Private Pro-
perty Bill, his short, ironic speeches on the selfish'
and unwisdom of the wealthy lower orders
did much for the cause of Liberalism and the
working miner.
Wicked North Queenslanders used to say
that Florence O’Driscoll wasn’t born to be drowned
anyway—and he evidently isn’t. Of four others—
Darlot, the N.W. squatter; Duffield, of Bewick
and Moreing, London engineers ; Hardinge, a
mining expert; and Fox, an English syndicate-
agent—concerned in the recent deplorable yacht-
accident at Perth Water, W.A., though all could
swim, not one reached the shore. O’Driscoll
safely got over the distance, and Dr. Fitzgerald,
of Queensland, clung to a plank and was picked
up. At least three of the deaths must be added
to the long tally of Coolgardie.
Mrs. Mott, S. A.’s “oldest woman,”
a colonist of 55 years, really had passed
the century, as the English register proves
her to have been 101 years and two
months old. The ancient dame married twice,
but the second time “incompatibility of temper ”
led to separation, and she resumed her first mate’s
cognomen. She was the mother of 14 children
(eight of whom still live); and as most of them
were as prolific, over 500 descendants, comprised
in five generations, are scattered about Australia.
She retained excellent eyesight to the end, and
for this was indebted to the otherwise trifling cir-
cumstance that she could neither read nor write.
Rev. A. R. Blacket, late of Sydney, and
still more recently of Prahran, Melb., is abandon-
ing a good clerical post to go to Persia as a mis-
sionary. He explains that whereas in Victoria
there is one minister to every thousand inhabi-
tants, there are in Persia tens of thousands
entirely without religious ministrations. He has
also discovered that married men who are not
young are specially wanted for disseminating the
Gospel in Persia—a most mysterious pronounce-
ment. Mr. Blacket was one of a crowd who
visited Carbine’s Melb. Cup meeting to hold a
prayer-symposium on the Flat.
Jack Gardiner, the footballers’ member for
Carlton, was a flourishing institution during the
Gillies period of Vic. politics. He drew an extra
£3OO as whip for the “party”—which included
the whole House, and didn’t want whipping to
vote for new railway lines—and he had as good a
time as any of them. But the young football-
barrackers grew older and wiser, and one sad
election-day Jack Gardiner found himself much
rejected. Now he seems to be in a state of
“extreme necessity,” which is the Minister of
Railways’ excuse for having taken “ poor Jack ”
on as a casual hand, whilst old employes are being
discharged.
M‘KIBBSIN, the N.S. W. bowler.
The January Bookman sheds some light
on the mystery of how the much-boomed Guy
Boothby came to annex the bumptious title of
“the Australian Kipling.” “It was, we believe,
in Melb. that he met Mr. Rudyard Kipling, who
read much of his MS., and thought so highly of
it that he advised him to devote himself to litera-
ture. Mr. Kipling also gave him much good
advice as to the management of his literary wares,
and we have heard Mr. Boothby say that the last
thing Mr. Kipling shouted to him from the deck
of the liner on which he was leaving Australia
was—‘Stick to it and put your trust in Watt,’
The ‘Watt’ is, of course, the well-known literary
agent.”
Rev. Shirley VYaldemar Baker has still
business connections with King George Tubou 11.
and the Tongan Government. The other day a
“white” Government official received a letter
from him, asking why the Tongan Government
were not continuing to send all orders for goods
through him as formerly, at the same time re-
minding said official that he owed his billet to S.B.
The Tongan Government imported goods to the
amount of <£osoo last year, so the commission—
-5 per cent, and pickings—is worth looking after.
Some little friction, it seems, had taken place over
50 cases of Norwegian beer (sent for M.’sP. during
the session), which the rev. gentleman picked up
at auction. The Tongan Parliament’s grog-bill
for its session of three months was ,£4OO.
N.S.W. District Court Judge Forbes, now
75 years of age, has got a year’s leave. Mr. Frank
Rogers, Q. 0., is mentioned as his successor, tem-
porarily and permanently. Mr. Rogers, it will be
remembered, was president of the N.S.W. Land
Court, and resigned because Government declined
to give him Supreme Court judicial status ; he
argued that, though he had no guarantee of the
continued existence of the Land Court, he was
compelled, while its president, to become a mere
land-law specialist and fall out of touch with
ordinary practice. Mr. Rogers, who has the
advantage of never having been a politician, is so
good a lawyer and so universally esteemed a man
that his acceptance of a District Court judgeship
will by no’ means bar his way to the Supreme
Court bench.
George Ash, Premier Kingston’s legal
partner, is making a great name in 4he S.A.

arms, and followed by a strong youth carrying 23
more. Then he intimated that he had 32 technical

objections to raise to the information, and on each
point he was supported by several volumes of pre-
cedents. Then the bench asked him if he intended
to take long over the case. “ Well,’’ said G. Ash,
“ I’ve studied your Worship’s convenience, and
I’ve arranged my objections in order of strength.”
“Ah,” said Gordon, P.M., “that’s a good idea.”
“But I meant to say,” continued Ash, “ that I’ve
got the weakest first!” When Ash had reached,
his eleventh objection and was just warming up,,
the Bench unanimously agreed with him and!
dismissed the case.
Last season, Charlton, one of the best-.
Australian judges of cricket, just before resigning:
from the selection committee cf N.S.W. Cricket-.
Association, went up to Mudgee with a Sydney
team, and stood umpire in a match against th.<->
Western Districts. He wanted to find a bowler,,
and he found one in M'Kibbin. The colt only
did moderately, getting four wickets in the firs*
innings and three in the second, but there was
something in his style, and in the way his ball flew
up from the pitch, which caused Charlton to
become his ardent champion. True, he didn't
altogether promise to become an interprovincial,
much less an international, bowler, but he was yet
a better man than the Sydney Club bowlers pre-
sent—W. Richardson, Hume, Sweetnam, and
Pierce. M'Kibbin played early this season with
the combined country team against a Sydney
eleven. The match was a big picnic for Donnan
and Gregory, who fairly hammered the colt’s
bowling, “ quilting ” him for four every time he
pitched the ball up. It was good for the specta-
tors ; it was good for Donnan and Gregory, who
retired each with 201 to his name. But it was
very bad for M‘Kibbin; his chance looked blue.
Still Charlton, Portus and Moses, watching him
in practice, insisted that he would yet do. And,
blessed with their hopes, he has represented
N.S.W. in every big match this season. He didn’t
come off against the English in Sydney, but his,
ill-health at the time was all-sufficient excuse. He,
got five wickets for 98 against them in Brisbane,,
and had five chances missed off his bowling.
M’Kibbin’s record-feat -was his eight for 00’.
against S.A. in the second innings. There is,
nothing succeeds like success, and many peop’e.
fancy that M'Kibbin’s success this season argues,
that he will ri val Turner at his best. But Charlton,,
who knows better, is far less sanguine. “He.
cannot do as much with the ball as Turner at his,
best, and will he learn to place his field as well!
and become as great a tactician?” M‘Kibbir«
bowls his bad ball when he tries to get too much
break on. He bowls mostly off-breaks, but sends
along a real good one at times in a slow leg-break.
And'’ he shoots in a fast, straight ball, which is
very deceptive in the flight. But M‘Kibbin was
“ properly pasted ” by the English in the last
test-match. How sardonically the discarded
Turner must have grinned at Giffen and Blackham,
the godfathers of the new man !

Melbourne Age, on a certain M.L.G. and
ex-Minister: “For a Victorian to go over to

wrecker and a political cad.”
Sir Henry Loch’s “ friendly recall ” from
South Africa is the more significant now that bis

immediate predecessor, Sir Hercules Robinson.
It seems to be a case of removing Boch home in
order to restore Robinson to the billet.

Much meat-eating seems to conduce to th©
growth of Democratic sentiments. Anyhow, the
butchers of Melbourne are Democrats almost to a
man. At their picnic last week the only M.’sP.

members—Maloney, Prendergast, Winter, Han-
cock, Beazley, Wilkins and Trenwith of Victoria,
and Reid of Queensland.
Our system of passing
acts, and at later sessions bring-
ing in amending acts, is admir-
ably calculated to confine the
knowledge of law to lawyers,
and fog laymen. When an act
requires amendment it should
be repealed and the parts
required embodied in a new
bill, together with the proposed
amendments, so that the bill
would be complete in itself.
The Vic. Railway Com-
mission is alleged to have been
very badly swindled in the
course of some of its investiga-
tions. When it commenced to
explore a new district to find out
if there was enough settlement
to support a line, all the male
population which could raise a
Fiorse to carry it would assemble
at the first stopping-place, to
greet the Commissioners and re-
present the large and influential
local population. Then, while
the officials were driven to the
next township, the influential
population would tear across
country and get ahead of it, and
be there to meet it a second
time. When the same influential
assemblage had met the Com-
missioners six or eight times,
these persons were firmly con-
vinced that such a thickly-
inhabited district ought to have
aline immediately. Sometimes,
it is alleged, not only did all the
able-bodied inhabitants turn up
over and over again, but people
were borrowed from remote
regions for the occasion. A good
many of the unprofitable lines
of Victoria are said to have been
Started by impressing some ob-
tuse official in this fashion.
The other day the shareholders of the
Weekly Herald, S. A. Labor paper, held a
meeting to consider Editor White’s resignation.
The meeting was extremely cordial. Three
minutes from the start Committeeman Proud had
been called a “ liar” several times, and
another committeeman had been described as “ a
sneak,” and as (one word) of uncertain parent-
age. The labor-leagues are hard bosses.
The Sydney Telegraph’s alleged “corres-
pondent ” writes in the Foreign-trade interest :
The return of the Secretary of the Treasury, U.S.A., for
1886 shows: —Population of the United States in gainful
occupation not subject to competition, 16,564,014; popula-
tion of the United States in gainful occupation subject to
competition, 827,184 ; or, in other words, about 96 per
cent, of the population are taxed to benefit or enrich the
other 4 per cent.
Moral : People are only taxed by import duties
when there are imports. In 96 per cent, of
American industries there are no imports. There-
fore there are no Cintom taxes paid. Therefore
the people are taxed because they don’t pay taxes.
The death of Wm. levers, M.L.A. (Vic.),
provides an opening for a pronounced democrat at
South Carlton. levers was a most popular man
personally, and leaves hosts of friends, but he had
no pretensions to political ability. He struggled
and canvassed for years before he won a seat, and
then kept his position through having only weak
men to fight. His opinions were neither numerous
nor clear. During the Turner regime, however,
he gave consistent support to the liberal proposals
of the Government, and was, in consequence, more
popular at the time of his death than at any pre-
vious period. He was one of the most liberal
members of Melbourne City Council.
Dr. Corbett, R.C. Bishop of Sale, Vic., on
that ungodly Education Act :
As long as the new generation of children will be
brought up systematically by the State without the
knowledge of God, as long as the teaching in Christless
schools will be built on materialism, anarchism will
flourish.
Anarchy is the outcome largely of repressive
religion, and wherever the priest or the parson has
his finger deepest in politics there anarchy and
nihilism are most threatening. Victoria, with its
system of secular education, cannot support a
single professing anarchist. How about Spain
and Italy? But there, “’tis if it isn’t if the
praste sez it is.”
Ex-Justice Foster, appointed to N.S.W.
Supreme Court bench, 14th Feb., 1888, at £2600
per annum, had 15 months’ leave on full pay
during his less than seven years’ service, and now
retires at the statutory pension of £lB2B per
annum. The Bulletin does not object to Judges
having largo pensions subject to certain stringent
conditions. On the contrary, it believes in all
Judges and all stipendiary magistrates being well
pensioned ; but, as will be seen above, it is an ex-
pensive business appointing to the S.C. bench
anyone whose ability to serve the regulation 15
years may reasonably be doubted. The country
is now giving ex-Judge Foster £36 a week for the
rest of his life simply because he sat on the bench
for less than six years.
With Hercules Robinson as Governor at
the Gape, there should be no bar to Cecil Rhodes’
schemes, as there are no bounds to his ambition.
It is openly said that Robinson is Rhodes’
nominee, chosen because his age and temperament
make him a suitable alfy for development of the
Great Africa policy—which seems to consist in
looting, for the benefit of English sharks, African
resources all the way from Cape Agulhas to the
Congo, and the establishment of an English
satrapy with Rhodes as satrap, and indiscriminate
millions of “niggers” toiling, after the fashion of
“ the poor Indians,” to pay £10,000,000 per
annum tribute to the Great White Queen. As
Hercules has latterly degenerated into an African
guinea-pig, in companies not unconnected with
Rhodesian manoeuvres, the allies of type and
temperament are still more firmly linked in the
enduring bonds of cash.
“THE BULLETIN’S" AMATEUR ART GALLERY.
“ GOIN’ FOR A DARNSE."
One Fenwick, of Melb. City Council,
objects to the proposed minimum wage on the
ground—as reported by the Age—that “ tlie
workingmen never give Is. or half-a-crown to
charitable purposes; they are regular grab-alls.”
Now, unless Eat Man Fenwick knows all the
workingmen in the world—which he doesn’t—he
can’t truthfully say they never give anything to
charity, therefore it would seem that he says it
without caring whether it is true or not. And,
unless Fenwick is the Almighty—which he isn’t—
he couldn’t tell whether the workingmen, even if
he knew them all, gave or didn’t give to charity.
Therefore, The Bulletin draws Fenwick’s atten-
tion to himself as a foolish and not very scrupulous
bigot, whose statements are calculated to call his
veracity into disrepute. Also, his existence shows
how very little brains are necessary for a city
councillor, so long as he has a large mutton-fist
with which to dab down statements whose crude-
ness and want ol artistic finish would make
Ananias feel ashamed.
Coghlan estimates that Australasian popu-
lation (now 4,153,768) increased 210 per cent, in
'94—the lowest increase (except ’93) since ’7B.

tion excess (13,731) nearly as much as she gained
by births excess (18,829). N.S.W. shows the

greatest increase (bar Westralia); but even Maori-
land can show, in addition to a births excess of
11,010, an immigration excess of 2,2s3—which
knocks the bottom out of the Fat theory that the
land-tax is driving people out of the country.
The sort of ooze which current political
leaders employ to solve high State problems :
Dibbs : “You junketted in Hobart at the public
expense.” Reid : “You junketted in England to
the tune of £1000.” Dibbs: “ You let Want
away on full salary for two months and a half.”
Reid: “You let Barton away to Vancouver on
full salary for three months.” Parkes : “All
these practices are illegal, unconstitutional, and
deserve the severest censure.” Dibbs and Reid,
facing about together: “ But you were guilty of
the whole of them yourself.”
In the recent Melb. libel-case, Morris v.
Age, little Ur. Maloney, M.L.A., deposed that in
his opinion David Syme is “the mqst powerful
man in the English-speaking world. V The Argus
did not report this—evidently because it was
making too much of David ; the Age also
omitted it —clearly because it made Syme look too
ridiculous. Syme is fidgetty about being dis-
cussed in his own paper. He dislikes personal
publicity, and many a reporter has endured his
frowning displeasure on account of haying men-
tioned his name in a report. But he is right. The
strongest journal would be one coming from no
one knew where—which rose with the sun daily or
was vomited forth by an earthquake at a given
hour every morning. And, if a paper must have
a proprietor, the ideal proprietor would be a man
with no interest, in this world or the next, but his
newspaper—who belonged to no church, club or
society, and who made it his business to know
everybody and yet be known by no one.
There is a possibility of the early retire-
ment of Mr. Justice Manning from N.S.W.
Supreme Court Bench. He is a more recent
appointee than ex-Judge Foster, and has been in
the Bankruptcy Court just about five years. He
is young as Judges go—being little over 40 —but is
in very indifferent health. During the hearing of
the will-case, Perpetual Trustee Co. v. Clarke, in
connection with the man who drew Glenloth in
Tattersall’s sweep a few years .ago, his Honor
took ill, and after the case had been held over for
about a week, it was transferred to Mr. Justice
Owen, and all the previous evidence had to be
either sworn to or reheard, causing much expense
to the litigants. As a barrister, “Charley”
Manning was most at home in Equity Court.
He has made so excellent a Judge that his enforced
retirement—apart from its heavy cost to the
country —would cause great regret.

While I defile the dinner-plate.

operative,; not socialistic-
communistic.
R. 0, Bishop Corbett,
of Gippsland, exhumes cer-
tain words once used by
Wilberforce Stephen, who
fathered the Vic. Education
Bill: “This measure intro-
duces the thin end of the
wedge into the Catholic
body. It will be driven
home, and rend the Catholics
asunder.” Here was a con-
solation for the Anglicans,
who said that Stephen, the
chancellor of their diocese,
was introducing a godless
measure. The sects had
capsized Higinbotham’s Bill,
which made the schoolmaster
a moral teacher.
“ Long ago, as a boy, I was taught to
speak the truth and shame the devil. Nowadays,
you speak the truth and shame the respectable;
which, however, is much the same thing.”—

How U.S.A. suffers by Protection. Otto
Von Der Busch, wool expert, of Dalgety’s, ex-
amined by Vic. Tariff Board, answers a question :
“The better class of wools are exported, are they
not?” “It all depends on the demand. The
better classes go to America in consequence of the
higher duty levied in that country.”
Let some N.S. Wales M.P. look up the
circumstances under which an individual who
lately got/two years for embezzling .£lOOO or so,
was released from gaol after serving only 10
months of his time. The sentence appears to
have been thoroughly well-deserved, and the
release has been kept remarkably quiet.
Dear Bulletin, —I worked last harvest
for one of Victoria’s hungry cookies—a God-fear-
ing man. First day we filed in to dinner I noticed
the only things on the table were several bottoms
of ale-bottles, upside-down, filled with salt. The
old man put his hands over his eyes and asked a
blessing on what we were about to receive, and
every soul of ns grunted “Amen.” Then Biddy
lifted up the big pot and threw on the table about
101 b. of boiled potatoes. “Now,” said she,
“ there’s plenty of salt; help yourself, me bhoys.
It’s a foine feed, barrin’the mate.” We struck.

Dear Bulletin, —I had a man laid up at
my place a few weeks ago ; he told me he wanted
“a course of medicine.” I replied that I had pills
and offered him some. He smiled- sadly and asked
me how many I had in stock. “Two boxes.”
“ Ah,” said he, “two years ago I took 80 pills
within 24 hours.” Eighty pills! He declined
my paltry contribution of two boxes as rob-
bing me without helping him. He left for
the nearest town where he could revel in pills!
All that was the matter with him was indigestion,
caused by over-smoking and drinking too much
stewed tea. He smoked nearly all night and
drank stewed tea-leaves all day. He wanted pills,
and by, this-time I hope he has had enough.—

Duke and Duchess of Madden are pre-
paring for another little burst of royal state in
Melbourne. The Hopetouns leave Government
House for ever at the end of this month, and
Brassey doesn’t steam up his yacht for the voyage
to Victoria until July. There will be more than
five months of Madden sovereignty. For 22
glorious weeks the Chief Justice’s lady will
“lead ” sassiety, and for 154 days her Astrakhan-
collared husband will meet his waxed moustache
on level terms, so to speak ! The illustrious pair
ought to feel happy, and they do.
Lady Hopetoun, for her part, hugs the thought
of getting away from Melbourne. The burden of
dear Lady Loch’s mantle has been almost more
than the diffident Irish colleen could bear. She
started in utter ignorance of what she was
expected to do, and the conviction that her smile
was unsatisfactory and her conversational powers
limited, settled on her mind and impaired her
digestion. At first Hopetoun used to catch his
Countess’s frightened eye, and make faces to the
effect that Hingland expected every Governor’s
wife todoher duty, but this marital pantomime only
embarrassed her the more. Lady H., trying to seem
vivacious, whilst a hundred women had their eyes
on her, was such a sad spectacle that everybody
felt much better wiien she relinquished the
struggle. Nature never intended Lady Hopetoun
to play the hostess. Perhaps Mullins, the
founder of her noble family, was a bashful person
—although retiring pork butchers don’t, as a rule,
achieve much greatness. Anyway, this particular
Governor’s wife, who makes herself very affable to
dumb animals (they can’t talk back), and enjoys
life up-country, is so frightened of “ company ”
that she has often wept, she says, before going
forth to face a dinner-party at. her home by the
smelly Yarra. Wherefore, The Bulletin expects
to hear of the ill-fated countess making her final
escape from Melbourne in the dead of night,
leaving her husband to disperse the mobs of lady
admirers who will come prepared to kiss her by
main force. The Hopetouns have arranged to sail
from Australia at Adelaide, in order to avoid the
ordeal of a long “ demonstration ” on Port Mel-
bourne pier.

“Rational” dress, The Bulletin is
credibly informed, has got hold of "the women by
night as well as by day, and they are taking to
pyjamas quite easily. Apropos, burglars lately
entered the house of a well-known Melb. musician,
and, while thfe female portion of the family were
huddled pyjama-clad, paterfamilias chased the
midnight marauder in a flowing garment.

It is said that English

An old man has for years
lived on the dead of a certain
sweet-smelling Australian river.
His trade, as stated by him-
self, is “dragging for stiffs.”
It is related of his predecessor
in the business that the wife of
a wealthy man gave him .£1 a
day to drag for poor hubby.
One week went, and a second ;
then the pay stopped and a
substantial reward was offered.
Next morning the old ’un,
looking quite happy, came
down-stream with a corpse in
tow, landed it and got the
money. The papers said the
corpse “ was much decom-
posed.” No wonder —the an-
cient had (somewhat after the
manner of horse-planters) had
it anchored at the stern of his
punt for a fortnight.

A court-martial is being held in Sydney
upon a giddy hoy in a glaring uniform. He is
charged with “ conduct unbecoming an officer and
a gentleman ” towards a young female, and the
court which is wrestling with the case consists
of the following unexampled mass of gorgeous-
ness :
President: Lieutenant-Colonel Janies Edward Doidge
Taunton, general staff, Assistant Qnarterraaster-General.
Members: Major and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel Henry
Park Airey, D. 5.0., New South Wales Artillery Regiment,
commanding brigade division, Field Artillery ; Major
Pembroke Lathrop Murray, New South Wales Artillery
Regiment, first garrison division; Major John Henry
Alexander Lee, Corps of Engineers, commanding No. 3
(Submarine Miners) Company ; Captain Haviland Le
Mesurier, New South Wales Artillery Regiment, first
garrison division. Officiating judge advocate : Victor Le
Gay Brereton, a solicitor of the Supreme Court of New
South Wales. Prosecutor: Major Arthur Henry Patrick
Savage, New South Wales Artillery Regiment, Acting
Assistant Adjutant-General. Major Montagu William
Bayly, adjutant 2nd Infantry Regiment, commandant
infantry school of instruction, and Lieutenant Maurice
Alfred Hilliard, adjutant 3rd Infantry Regiment, also
attended for instruction.
The nine members of the court-martial have 31
names among them, and a yard and three-quarters
of title. And all this overwhelming mass of
nomenclature and lace and cocked hat is being
wasted on a case which could be settled
much better by a plain P.M. Every regi-
ment ought to have at least one officer
called B, Smith and nothing more, who
would be kept specially for court-martial pur-
poses. To use Pembroke Lathrop Murray and
Haviland Le Mesurier and James Edward D oidga
Taunton for such a purpose—saying nothing of
Montagu William Bayly or Victor Le Gay Breve-
ton—is awful waste.

There doesn’t seem to be much in the
contention that the regular courts, and not a
court-martial, should have taken cognisance of
the Sydney military scandal. Had the captain
been charged with a criminal offence, no doubt
he should have been tried in the ordinary way i
as his conduct apparently involves only a military
offence, or a ease for civil damages, it is imma-
terial how he is first dealt with. The lady may
please herself. She has still her rights at civil
law, whatever the issue of the court-martial.

Through the courtesy of a correspondent,
The Bulletin is enabled to print in this issue the
portrait of Mr. Munro Ferguson, M.P. for Leith,
Governor-Designate of South Australia. Mr.
Ferguson is now a Liberal of the advanced order.
In 1886, however, he contested Ross-shire against
the land-league candidate, Hr. Mae.donald, and
got beaten by four to one. He was then a mere
boy, but his cleverness attracted attention and he
was shortly afterwards appointed secretary to
Lord Rosebery, the present British Premier. He
is said to be a rich man, of a bright and emotional
disposition, who would probably make a popular
Governor even in slow-going South Australia.

CLERICAL OLD GENTLEMAN (seeing hoy praying and murmur-

will descend, from Heaven to freshen and make

seems to have chosen the eminently Scotch city of
Dunedin as her chief hunting-ground. When It
prances along with an attempt to be degage and
shows off inadequate tan-stockinged legs, ill-cut,
baggy breeches, and a vilely-fitting coat, with a
j a „ n ty sailor-hat perched on an elderly head, and
a f ri ii e( j umbrella to complete the costume, the
Dunedinites fancy they have strayed into a panto-
mime, Some wearers, instead of a coat, sport a
kind of tunic suggestive of a bathing costume or
gymnasium-suit; but even this will not conceal
the fact that the better figure a woman possesses
from the standpoint of feminine beauty the worse
she is when she arrays herself in men’s garments.
The “ Rational ” Woman deserves notoriety, and
she has got it.
One of the leaders of the movement, on her way
back to M.L. per mailboat, concealed her knicker
suit beneath a cloak while on deck, but in her own
cabin threw off the cloak and, like a free woman,
rang for supper. The attendant steward, how-
ever, being a modest man, did not wait for orders,
but, seeing the thin stockinged and knickered legs,
fled incontinently. Another ring, and another

steward, who, mumbling a hasty apology, likewise
withdrew grinning. Then came a furious peal,
which the chief-steward answered in person—only
to find the Rational Woman pacing the cabin,
scarlet with fury. “How is it, please, that when
I ring the stewards open the door and go away
again without waiting a moment ! It is disgrace-
ful ! I want some supper 1” The chief-steward
stroked his moustache to conceal a smile.
“ Madam, I suppose the young fellows—not being
used to your style of costume, thought that you—
excuse me—were undressing.”

“ I saw a dress-reform woman yesterday
in Princes-street, Dunedin” (M.L.), writes a
Bulletin man. “She had a forbidding coun-

feet like a policeman’s, and her stride like a sailor
just ashore from a long voyage. All the men
stared at her, the old women glared, and the
young ones giggled. She is either very brave, or
very fond of notoriety. As to the new dress being
a ‘ reform,’ it depends, I should think, upon what
* pre-form ’ was.”

Bisbop Beggar, of Kanakaland, tells this
story of his clerical enemy, the Rev. (say) Smith.
Mr. Smith, one day in a Brisbane suburb, absent-
mindedly sat down on a green-ants’ nest, and only
found it out when he had got into the train.
Being alone in the compartment, he took his
trousers off, shook them out of the window, and
—dropped them !
In despair, he retired to a corner of the com-
partment to count his bites. While still thus
engaged the train stopped at a station, and (of
course) a lady got in and advanced cordially to
the rev. gentleman, who had hastily thrown his
mackintosh over his bare legs and sat cowering.
“How do you do, Mr. Smith?” said the lady,
who knew him well. The agonised parson was
just about to remark that he did “nicely, thank
you,” when he found that the ants had got under
the mackintosh, and, instead of the polite greet-
ing he had intended to utter, he emitted a pro-
longed howl.
“Is anything the matter with you, Mr. Smith?”
enquired the alarmed ewe-lamb. The distressed
sky-pilot, busy catching ants under the mackin-
tosh, could only moan feebly in reply. “I believe
you’ve been drinking, Mr. Smith,” said the lady,
severely, “ and —oh !oh ! guard 1” The exclama-
tion was caused by the sudden appearance of a
writhing leg which protruded beyond the shelter
of the mackintosh.
When the train reached another station, the
Rev. Smith gathered the mackintosh round him,
and dashed into the station-master’s room, whence,
as the shades of evening fell, a very subdued
shepherd, attired in the regulation blue-and-gold
of the railway service, emerged and hurried home-
wards.
They say that a fortunate New Woman now
rehearses nightly in the gentle Shepherd’s lost
cords.

The most notable feature about the case
of Mr. Carey, the unfortunate young English bar-
rister who shot himself in his office in Castle-
reagh-street, Sydney, is that, if he had missed
himself, the bullet—in the opinion of the Austra-
lian Star— would probably have gone through
the ceiling and wounded another lawyer in the
office overhead. The Bulletin once, knew of a
man who missed himself with a pistol-shot and
badly injured a compositor, and there is comfort
in the fact that the only person endangered in the
present case was an attorney.
Melbournian : “On the
Sydney side I read another case
of sacrilege, which renews my
objection to such being made a
crime. I am not sure that
Pentridge does not still contain
a wretched and wronged victim
of the outrageous value set by
a Judge on some cheap utensils
of his own sect.”

A Melbourne man had
half-a-dozen cottages at South
Melbourne. The right-of-way
to the shanties was 12ft. wide
by 100 ft. long. The tenants
were “ fairly decent pays,” and
the landlord, thinking to im-
prove the property and to make
things more comfortable, re-
cently had the right -of - way
paved with octagonal wooden
blocks. By that act he ruined
the reputations of his tenants
and lost his faith in mankind,
for in less than a week every
block had been dug up and
used for firewood. He remon-
strated, but was silenced with
the remark that “ the d d
fences would go if he didn’t shut
up.”

At the Sydney mortuary
station, Regent- ;t., Redfern, on j

An Australian Bishop with a decided
(though unreciprocated) weakness for the fair sex,
had a warm time in a suburban railway carriage,
the other day. Seated next an exceptionally fair
member of his flock, he was worrying her with his
clumsy attentions when the train entered a
tunnel. Sounds of a slight scuffle and an exclama-
tion in a female voice were heard above the rattle
of the train, and the other occupants were
amused, when they emerged into daylight, to find
that his lordship’s fair companion had bolted to
the far end of the oar, while the clerical Lothario
himself—very confused, and with one side of his
face much redder than the oth *r —was busily
arranging his gaiters. A forgotten poet has re-
marked : “If girls won’t kiss you when they see,
don’t try it in the dark.”

clerk at .£3 per week he would get 50 applicants.
Some few months ago I advertised for a clerk and

several from solicitors, including one from a
stylish attorney apparently in good practice, and
one from a law-clerk who, to my knowledge, some
years previously was apologised to by a Melbourne
firm because they could not see their way clear to
pay him more than =£lo per week. Of all the 187
only one asked as much as .£3 per week, and ho
was not a bona-fide law-clerk. —Yours, Q., Sydney

Another Sydney shark - tragedy—a boy
named James Donald having been so mutilated by
a 14 footer, at Leichhardt, Sydney, while bathing
in 6ft, of water, that he died of shock shortly
afterwards. The recklessness of bathers is some-
thing astounding. The present writer —who

The New Woman isn't any

fizzled out had she not betaken herself
to a quasi-prurient exploitation of
sexual relations, a N.S.W, oratoress,
after standing logic on its head and
cutting all the common-place capers of
the cult, was fain to fall back upon the
good old marriage-question. “Why

Christchurch (M.L.) has a smaller propor-

But the fruit-trade of Wellington is monopolised
by the Ch.ow, who ripens bananas and polishes
apples in his own sweet way. An attempt was
lately made by a syndicate of Wellington Chinese
to obtain a footing in Christchurch. A shop was
quietly fitted up and burst into activity one
Saturday morning, but the European fruiterers
at once decided to boycott any auctioneer selling
to the Chows, and the neighboring tenants threa-
tened to move in a body. In the end the landlord
was glad to get rid of his yellow tenant. Thus
the Tartar invasion was repelled. But many of
the fruiterers (who also vend vegetables) surrepti-
tiously buy supplies from the Chinese gardeners.

It vyas not generally known that the Duke
of Edinburgh, when first he visited Melbourne,
went ashore in company tvitb Elliot Yorke the
night before he made his public landing, and
visited an old friend of his, the French actress
Madame Celeste, at a Carlton boarding-house,
where the party drank wine and smoked. The
fact is by no means important, but the proof of it
is certainly most amusing—consisting, as it does,
in the circumstance that a few days ago a Vic-
torian lady, who lately succeeded to a very large
sum of money, bought for 30 guineas a gorgeous
glass case, containing three glasses stained with
wine, a bottle still containing a little wine, two
cigar-stumps and a box of matches. On a silver
shield attached to the case is engraved—“ These
glasses, etc., were used by the Duke, etc.’’ The
original owner of this splendid hunk of glory
lately died.

Melbournian: “At a late funeral of an
important personage, the service was beautifully
intoned by the clergyman. How different from
the style in which I have heard him gabble the
service over a pauper !”
Dear B deletin', —The reason why
woman prefer the “Chinese market
gardener” to the “European vendor,”
is simply because they perceive more
manliness and candour—more of the
gentleman and infinitely less of the
hog-in the former than in the latter.
“ The cabbagee Chinaman,” as you
term him, is never unkind to a woman;
the “European vendor” sometimes is
—at least, I fancy so. Also, I think
you may be inclined to admit that just
occasionally he really is. The China-
man never turns up his nose at his
former mistress in the street, nor des-
pises her even when every hair in her
head is white and every tooth in her
head lias gone for ever. He is still kind
and gentle to the poor human outcast
and wreck, and has even, to my own
personal knowledge, assisted with
money, store goods, and vegetables
women of precisely this character. Do
the noble “European vendors” act
likewise? It is quite true—only too
true for the unfortunate Chinaman—
that “ women prefer a Chinaman’s
‘ twiddle twaddle ’ to making their pur-
chases in a business-like way with
European vendors” (italics mine).
Women well know that this identical
“ business-like way ” of dealing with
“European vendors ” leads straight up
to the bailiff and the Debtors’Prison.
A bit of harmless chaff and a woman’s
smile, with “ Here’s four shilling and
sixpenny, John! You come next
Saturday, me pay you plenty more,
John,” will send away in a smiling trot
a Chinaman to whom, say, .£6 ss. 4d.
is justly owing; but, by heaven, the
“European vendors” or the District
Court bailiffs are not to be bluffed
in this manner, and women know it. If
you only knew how much money is owing
to the “ Cabbagee Chinaman ” in Sydney and
every town in N.S.W. you would curse me, go
mad, and wear a pigtail. The amount would
astound you, and a fiftieth part of it will never be
paid. Europeans in N.S. VV. are actually living on
Chinamen in the vegetable line. Yours, &c., Ah
Kow, Mudgee, Feb. 17.

Mrs. Edith Johns, Nelson, New Zealand, who
writes I am glad to be able to add my testi-
mony and thanks to you for the great benefit I
have received from your Tonic. About two years
ago I got very thin and pale, and had a fearful
pain in my chest, which increased so that I could
not stand upright. I saw a doctor, who said my
lungs were weak; he gave me some medicine and
said 1 must not go out in the night air, but instead
<> getting better I gradually got worse, and I was
triad enough not to have to go out at all, but lie
down all day. This went on for months, and
people called it indigestion ; and one day a friend
recommended Clements Tonic, which I com-
menced taking at once, and before the first bottle
was finished I felt better, and after the second
was as well as ever; I could walk any distance
people that know me say I am a different girl, and
a good advertisement for Clements Tonic. To-day
1 would not be without it, and I only hope this
wdl induce others to try your valuable medicine.
—Believe me, yours very gratefuby, Edith Johns,

My Dear Moorabinda —
A prominent N.S.W. society family would
seem to be going in for matrimony wholesale—
mamma (relict of a legal man) and her brace of
daughters all being “engaged girls” together. I
think the burning question in that household
ought to be “ Who’s gooseberry ?” Do the
daughters have to cough loudly and turn off the
gas when mamma’s young man shows symptoms of
wanting to occupy the drawing-room until the
witching hour ? And are they heard using mut-
tered language inside the house when their
amorous progenitress makes her good-bye-at-the-
gate longer than usual ? And if all the suitors
ever arrived together who looks after the senti-
mental sextette in the interests of Mrs. Grundy ?
One of the strongest points in favor of what
Shelley called “life’s great cheat’’ (he meant
marriage) is that the connubial bereaved of both
sexes are always so red-hot to go it twice, as the
gamblers say. A wicked Melbournian advertised
in one of the dailies the other day to the effect
that “Rich widower requires faithful wife, looks
no object, but must have great soul”—the advt.
being inserted for whatever fun there might be in
it. He got 76 applications, and 40 came from
widows. Seventy-six great-souled women in
Melbourne? But some of the orthography was
heroic : “ i wish to eorispond with you,” wrote
one*great soul “ i am of English nationality and
a prodistant, i arn a widow this last three years.”
But even these advantages didn’t turn the adver-
tiser’s jest to earnest.
A flighty damsel told me, the other day, as
significant of the mocking state of the marriage-
market just now, that she inserted a similar advt.
in a Sydney paper just for the humor of it, only
her hook was out for a young man, of course. But
slrn didn’t get much for her money. There wasn’t
a bite ! If the market is so shy as all that no
wonder the agony columns in the dailies are full of
hungry parsons’ advts. People who don’t want a
wedding but only howl for a ceremony can get
very tightly tied together for half-a-crown in
Sydney nowadays.
Which reminds me that a youth and maiden
turned up to be welded together, the other day,
by one of these enterprising workers in the Vine-
yard (the grape-juice gets into their noses some-
times !) whose unblushing advts., egging thought-
less people on to matrimony, are on every break-
fast-table. But a hitch occurred in the very be-
ginning. “What is the lady’s name?” unctuously
queried the holy man, and the happy bridegroom
looked bewildered. “ Blessed if I know,” he said
at last—“you see, it’s this way, boss : I only met
her for the first time last night in the dark.”
Now, I wonder if that marriage was made in
Heaven ?
I have discovered a revival in feminine nomen-
clature—there is a modern tendency to resurrect
double-barrelled names. We are only a step off
Maryann, Jemimajane, and those other weird
cognomens which old - time parents rolled
under their tongues like a sweet morsel and were
proud of—just as if a comet’s tail of names sug-
gested affluence to the bearer. The new baptismal
double-bangers are intended to be more elegant
than the old. For example, “Clairellen” is the
newest name out of Smelbourne. It may be
more euphonious than Maryjane—but that is about
all the difference. Both are equally vulgar.
I went to the Haunted Swing, in Pitt-st. (under
the sway of Macmahon), twice last week, and
consider it the completest illusion on tap. There
is really nothing to be nervous about, and it is far
more decorous than the common or garden swing,
where the girls tie handkerchiefs round their
ankles to keep their skirts down. Nobody’s skirt
deviates an inoh from the path of propriety,
though the wearer does feel as if standing on her
head which must rather handicap the show from
a man’s point of view, I should think. It is quite
fashionable to “do” the Haunted Swing. Society
theatre-parties, after having a pleasant chat at the
play, sometimes finish up with a wild whirl right
over, when belledom clutches frantically at its
silken petticoats—though that is not at all neces-
sary.
A bulging audience in a fearful state of war-
paint turned up to sample “The Fatal Card”
(the latest London success), just put on at Sydney
Royal by the up to-date Bland Holt. That
perennial popularity looked about two-and twenty
at the most in a twilight-grey suit with a pink
dickey (surely to the willowy mummer all things
histrionic are possible), although one of the most
absorbing situations in the play occurred when
Mr. Holt, clad simply in a winning smile—was
taking a bath in the stage stream. Methinks rather
too much stress is put upon the horrors of being
found out ablutionising by your best girl—for an
Australian audience at least. Australia is a place
where every headland looks alive with boiled
lobsters on their hind-legs, which prove to be he-
bathera on nearer view. The average Australian
damsdl within oooee of a pond of water is quite
used to her Gussie plain on the half-shell, as it
were.
In this aforesaid bathing-scene (it certainly does
go a bit close to the k-nuekle) pretty Mrs. Holt, in
Australian blue and white, played a rather
“wide” situation very daintily. Hilda Spong
was Margaret Marrable. The bewohus Hilda,
one of the prettiest home-grown (not ’Ome-grown)
actresses in Australia, was distinctly too boister-
ous for a young lady whose papa had such a rush
of furniture to his front verandah. Well-regu-
lated young women are not simooms—neither do
they steer themselves with their elbows. Nothing
is more aggressive than an actress who appears to
consider a fairly roomy stage too small for her to
properly show her action on. Hilda is also
developing fleshily. While the stalwart W. O.
Baker remains in the heroic lead this doesn’t
matter much, but I don’t think a weedier leading
man would look so secure in the same perilous
position.
The dressing in the sympathetically-staged
drama is neat and occasionally gaudy—Virgin
Vivienne, in devilish scarlet and black, looked as
if she got her fashions from Shed, but they suited
the, part. By the way, I was great y re-assured
by Flora Anstead’s treatment of the trousers
which fell upon her out of a clear sky in the third
act. “ Remove those abominations,” she shrieked
—“take away the horrid things!” It is a plea-
sant seivsatien nowadays to hear a woman throw-
ing language like that at the divided garment.
A certain city is pleasantly amused o’ Sundays
just now, I hear, by a “ praste ” who encourages
the attendance at his church of a burlesque co.
performing in the town, although his priestly rival
over the way looks sideways on the painted band
—possibly because the other padre’s tender was
accepted first. But the wider-minded “ father,”
with Tottie and Co. gracefully exhibited near the
organ warbling to full houses every Sabbath day
and the coin tinkling in the colleetion-p'ate, feels
that his is the better part. If every cleric had a
variety co. at his disposal there would, I am sure,
be no need to go about asking why don’t men go
to church.
It has just transpired that the Pope won’t allow
his Fathers O’Flynn (speaking in a generic sense)
to ride a bicycle built for one like the other deno-
minations do, with streaming coat-tails and show-
ing six inches of sock. You see the Pope knows a
thing or two. His church is generally regarded
as a supreme embodiment of worldly wisdom—
or of priestcraft, according to what theological
position you may happen to view the matter from
-rand this Papal ukase ought to set women a-
tlwnking, it seems to me.
For, if it isn’t considered dignified for a priest
to work his legs over the spindle in public, it
certainly cannot be dignified for a woman to go
practising for the tread-mill in public streets —
even if it doesn’t hurt the woman herself it checks
the possible innocence of hobbledehoys here and
there who might think that women tapered off
into mermaids’ tails if they did not seek to
violently prove the contrary. If the New Woman
could only be got to see it, one of the Old Woman’s
very strongest points was that she (in the Queen
of Spain sense) had no legs. Let the New Woman
consult His Eminence Patrick Francis Card.
Moran ere she finally decides to let the world
know that she is supported on forks—l mean
before she definitely adopts the trousers.
But I am wrong to talk of trousers —I don’t
mean because they used to be regarded as a more
or less delicate subject, those benighted days are
past—but because those long leg-bags are not the
goal of my emancipated sisters’ ambition.
Knickerbockers are the things they’re grabbing at,
and have already grabbed in many instances.
There’s not a single instance of a woman yearning
for trousers, simply because they hide their legs as
thoroughly as skirts do, and that’s not the con-
summation the women devoutly wish—for the
New Woman is more badly mashed on man than
evier the Old Woman was. She knows that man is
always keen to criticise the female leg, and as she
is quite as keen that he should have every decent
opportunity of doing so, knickerbockers are the
only wear to achieve the result and yet keep on
the blind side of Mrs. Grundy, Everything is to
be traced to woman’s vanity. I’ll bet you that
Mrs. Brown-Potter won’t be in a hurry for the
Bloomer baglets !
I was sorry to miss the Sydney Fencing Club’s
assault evening (held, however, at 4 p.m., to the
accompaniment of afternoon tea) last Tuesday,
because I am one of the club’s staunchest admirers.
I beHeve in fencing for wotnen. Some day I will
learn to parry and thrust with my parasol and
make deadly feints with my fan, so that the hour
of peril will not find me unprepared. The only
real drawback to fencing is the get-up. Diving
head-gear and pads are both hot and unbecoming,
to my mind. Still, fencing is one of the greatest
figure-improvers among the sports and pastimes
when it’s all over, and is sard to encourage quite a
Junoesque frontal development.
In re the rather boring military scandal, which
drags its slow length along, some of the officers
of the N.S.W. Permanent Artillery are of opinion
that the present malodorous enquiry will about
“kill” the service, so far as Parliament and the
Democratic vote is concerned —though I don’t sup-
pose for a moment that such a trifle will make
society fall away from its epaulette-worship.
Society’s digestion is not weak, from a moral
point of view. One or two glum soldiers, how-
ever, say that pharisaioal skirts have been so hastily
whisked out of their way lately, that it really
seems that the officers’ barracks might as well be
removed to the lazarette.
After all, one can’t expect too much “officer
and gentlemanly ” behaviour from the Australian
service—l think service is a good name for an
organisation chiefly governed by drapers. Nearly
all the Australian War-Ministers and other
legislative militaires are garter-merchants. They
are all horribly bloodthirsty, too—a darksome
state of mind, brought on, 1 suppose, by reach-
ing down the latest designs in blankets from
the top shelf for the old lady who finally goes
out with a reel of cotton, after four hours’ talk.
That sort of thing is enough to make a man
howl for gore, and that’s why so many soft
handed and mild little drapers, all with the
soapy polish of a shop-walker, rear up on their
hind logs on public platforms and breathe blood-
and-thunder.
I have received a copy of the “ Message of the
Wires,” written by Bernard Espinasse, to the
music of George Pack. It is dedicated to Maggie
Moore, who seems to have made a great success
with it in “ Aladdin,” at Melb. Royal. The
“ Message of the Wires” is a very good song of
its class, and one that would score anywhere
where the dot-and-dash science was understood.
The reference to the wife and child dying of cold
and hunger is quite English, you know: and ought
to recommend it to any music-hall artiste on the
look-out for novelties at ’Gone.
From publisher H. J. Samuells (who is alleged
to have spent a couple of thousand in one calendar
year on fostering more or leas Australian musical
genius) comes Ldon Caron’s extremely graceful
song “My Wedding Day.” This is an altogether
attractive burst of melody, and warbled by a
songstress (in bridal robes for choice, if she is a
professional) would “go” in any hemisphere
where they don’t capture their brides with a nullah-
nullah. Tasma Sherwin has sung it with great
success in Sydney, although she didn’t dress the
part.
Prince Josef of Battenberg has departed from
our midst after having done Sydney the honor of
spending all his Australian time in Sunny N.S.W.
Prince Josef and his train of two did the lions
with the assiduity of a Cook’s tourist—he heard
the organ and characterised Wiegand’s perfor-
mance as perfect. He breathed his second-class
royal approval over the veteran ex-Pretnier Parkes
and shook him reverently by the hand with the ex-
pression, “ Now we will die happy.” He also ven-
tured undismayed into Parliament House, and
was doubtless aghast that only one member walked
out backwards—lie was a Government supporter.
The Sydney beauties had reverent worship paid
to them on the Block in Melbourne last week.
Falk’s have just opened a studio there and have
boomed the enterprise by filling the windows with
photographs of pretty women in all sorts of poses,
representing all manner of types of feminine love-
liness. Crowds of admiring youth have, I hear,
been round the window every day, so that it has
been impossible to get near without waiting one’s
turn in patience.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
There has been trouble over the combined team’s
match against the Englishmen at Brisbane, and Iredale,
Gregory, and M'Kibbin are mentioned as having com-
plained of their treatment by J. V. Francis, the promoter.
Francis tells the Brisbane papers that he paid Iredale,
£l5, Gregory £l2 10s., and M'Kibbin £5 Is., besides exes.,
for their services. These three players are, of course,
amateurs ; and the incident sets one wondering anew as
to where amateurism will end. Of course, it is only fair
that they should be reimbursed for their loss of time; but
as soon as payment is made at all the nice distinction
between “loss of lime” and services cannot be main-
tained with any degree of satisfaction.
Theoretically, the line of division is clear
enough. An amateur should not be a penny out of
pocket nor a penny in pocket. The moment he takes a
penny more tnan he would have earned otherwise than at
sport, that moment he becomes a professional. Accord-
ingly, an amateur should charge his losses as a profes-
sional charges his profits - beforehand. Then, as Mr.
Francis says, a promoter (hateful necessity 1) could make
his calculations accordingly.
♦ » » ♦
The luck of the toss has been dead against the
Englishmen in the test-matches. Three times there was
a hard wicket to start upon, and the Australians got the
best of the start. Once it W'as .very wet, and then also
Stoddart guessed head instead of tail, and was ordered
“ in ” by the relentless Giff. Upon the solitary occasion
when Stoddart won the toss he lost all chance of victory
by trying to take advantage of bis good fortune.
On the opening day of the final struggle the
fielding of the Britishers was not more praiseworthy than
the Australians’safe baiting. The ball didn’t go high in
the air from a really rash stroke once during the five
hours’ play.
There was a Black Friday expression on the
face of the multitude at the M.C.C. ground when four
Australian wickets had fallen for less than 150 runs.
When Gregory and Darling started to beat the bounds
with the ball the sea of faces broadened, and Young
Australia was itself again.
Lockwood had to leave the field awhile in the
rubber match, and young Trott again acted in his stead.
Stoddart’s team will always lie remembered for the fact
that they didn’t once meet All Australia without requir-
ing the services of a substitute for somebody at some
period of the game.
• * * *
A most noticeable piece of snobbery at the big
Melb. test-match was disclosed by the operation of the
rule compelling the English professionals to retire to the
pavilion by a different gate to that used by the “gentle-
men.” Why does not some real gentleman player in the
team join the profs, and go in by the same gate by way
of protest ? The team came out to play cricket, not
Sovereign and Subject, or Bank versus File.
* • * •
M‘Kibbin has uncommon flexibility of wrist.
Placing his arm upon a table, with the hand palm-down,
he can, keeping the forearm rigid, twist his hand round
from the wrist until the palm faces upward. This supple-
ness gets many a batsman out; he cannot tell whether
M’Kibbin is going to bowl an off or a leg-break, and
M'Kibbin’s breaks would be bad enough if labelled, for he
often comes back or in a whole foot on a batsman’s wicket.
♦ » * ♦
M'Kibbin got five wickets for 98 against the
English in Brisbane, and had five chances missed off him.
Iredale, who was standing behind the wicket, says that
one leg-break of M'Kiobin’s, completely beating Brown,
touched the leg-bail, making it wobble to and fro ; a hair-
breadth more power and it would have rocked off. As it
was, it went back to its rest in the stump-grooves.
* * * *
About that “throw”(?) of M'Kibbin’s. Phillip-
son, the English umpire, would never no-ball the N.S.W.
bowler. “ It does not look so fair a delivery as Palmer’s,
nor as Peel’s, but it is fair enough in a 1 conscience.” The
Adelaide umpire concurs in this judgment. Many a good
judge thinks that Englishman Richardson’s “throw ”(?)
is more definite y a throw than M'Kibbin’s “throw” (?) is.
* * » •
The best of his fellow-provincial players think
that M'Kibbin is the best bowler on al W'ickets that
N.S.W. possesses, and they most zealous y advocated his
inc.usion in the test-team. M'Kibbin has one strong
opponent—a wonder, whose star, rising suddenly years
ago to meridian height, and staying there longer than
other great ones, is yet s'ow y but surely declining. The
greatest athlete has his day, but Turner dies hard and may
■yet have to be resurrected.
* * * *
E. T. Smith, the S.A. king of cricket, will be
much cut up at having to hand over the Sheffield Shield,
which has been snugly ensconced at his residence at Kent
Town (S.A.) for some months.
* » * *
Adelaide cricketers say that it is not surprising
the S.A, eleven was defeated in Melb. and Sydney. Instead
of encouraging young cricketers, the selection-committee
pick out old stagers like Noel, and ignore consistent
juniors to pick that consistent failure in big matches,
Walter Giffen.
* • * *
The most trying development of these mad
times is the special cricket gossiper who attends test-
matches on behalf of a “great weekly,” and pours a
stream of drivel uudefiled into the next two numbers.
Horse-reporting is poetry compared with cricket gossip,
or “stray notes,” or whatever it may he called, when the
old special persoq gets turned on to do something light
and chatty. He usually starts with the bald announce-
ment that “ It was hot,” after which comes a list of
venerable persons who could, or who thought they could,
remember warmer weather on previous historic occasions.
After a bit the genius gets himself fairly wound up, and
the fountain of small talk plays somewhat as follows ;
“‘l’ve seen worse strokes than that,’ said Dan Grum-
miok, a famous wicket-keeper in the Western district
when the century was younger. Dan was feasting on the
ripe stolid innings of G. GiflVn and exchanging confidences
With tough John Jorrer, whom I remember as a respect-
able cover-point in the early days at Castlemains.
Michael Hump (many’s the time I’ve seen Michael wipe
the perspiration from his kindly lace after a long day’*
leather-hunting on a certain little ground, long since built
over, alas! at Ballarat) had tapped him on the shoulder
as he passed by only ten minutes before the words were
spoken. ‘ Yes, I’ve seen worse strokes than that,' reiter-
ated Dan. Tom Soaker, who hadn’t stirred on his perch
since the resumption of play, looked around with his old-
fashioned''Parramatta smile and cordially endorsed the
terse remark. Tom likewise had seen worse strokes than
that clean, daisy-clipping drive to the boundary, near to
where Peter Maunder, of Adelaide, was leaning over the
rails. 1 What say you? ’ he asked of the‘captain.’ The
captain scratched his head (it still bears the hump he got
from a long drive-one of the best leg drives he ever saw
in his life, the victim is fond of saying) and slowly came
to the conclusion that ‘he didn’t know whit to say.’ ”
Truly test-matches have a lot to answer for.

Curio : “ I read that Giffen only gets .£lBO a
year as a civil-servant—and what a shame it is he is not
promoted ! One imagines his P.O. superior saying to
him : ‘ Really, Mr. Giffen, you are such a valuable man—
indeed, indispensable—that I hardly see how we can spare
you for this trip to Melbourne ’ —or Sydney, or England,
as the case may be. What does he do? Sort letters?
When does he put in his service ? A goodly sum might
be realised at a shilling a head for seeing him at work."
**• * *
The yarn which reached Sydney about Coning-
ham apologising to Stoddart during the match in Bris-
bane turns out to he cock-and-bull. Bannerman no-balled
Coningham for a throw, and in order to show the in-
fallible Charles the difference between a bowl and a throw
Coningham threw the next ball instead of bowling it.
Then the cricket-liar arose and had his innings.
Hosts of people missed Turner in the Interpro-
vincial match.
How that ’9O team was picked for England is
one of the vexed questions of cricket history. Gregory
says he was picked five weeks before the team left, but
soon after he was put out for Walters or R. M'Leod, and
then at the last, as R. M'Leod couldn’t go, he was finally
given a place. Another historic curiosity of this notorious
“picking” was the selecting of Burns, the Tasmanian, for
wicket-keeping. And Burns, says Gregory, had perhaps
never kept wickets in his life.
Gregory was rather more of a batsman than the
public generally think before he went the first time to
England. The second time he played with the Orientals
he managed to run up 75 runs.
» * » *
A writer in the Clarion (Eng.) had something
rational to say re the results of the first two test-matches.
“The Australian papers are fairly unanimous in the
opinion that Stoddart’s team is the best that has been out
i i Australia. The tall scoring and extraordinary result
of the first test-match have doubtless led the colonials a
bit astray, and made them form conclusions which would
hardly hear analysis. The tour is only half completed,
and for myself I prefer waiting until it is over before in-
dulging too much in comparisons. Our men are doing
7i. ore than the most enthusiastic patriot ever expected
them to do, and doing it in the department which was
considered their weakest. So far, the batting averages me
considerably higher than those of any previous teams,
hut though the Englishmen have come on in the batting,
they’ve sadly deteriorated in the howling line.” The
writ r foresaw that Stoddart and co. would get b aten as
soon as they ceased to score heavily, inasmuch as they
had proved themselves unable to get rid of iheir oppon-
ents cheaply. And he says: “I question whether Aus-
tralian cricket was ever held in as much respect as at the
present time,” which is rather different to the “blow”
cabled out to us as Hinglish expert opinion at the time.
• » ♦ »
England seems just as mad on cricket as Aus-
tralia. To meet the demand for news of Stoddart’s
Eleven, London E. News and the Sun kept on cribbing
the P.M. Gazette's special cables until millionaire Aster
got an injunction against them.
* * • »
Sydney Telegraph has a column and a half
of neat hexameters which claim to deal with lhe last test
cricket-match, and never get within three months of it.
As showing what a sporting bard can do when he tries,
take these:
Stoddart (the captain), and Ward, and Brown, and
Phillipson, Brockwell,
Richardson, Peel, Ford, Briggs, Maclaren, Gay, Lock-
wood, and Humphreys.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Outside criticism on M'Kibbin: “He looks
such a funny little chap that you would never think he
could bowl so w ell.”
* * * *
“ I don’t wish to say anything against
M'Kibbin,” said Turner, “but I have my r putation.”
Are matches won by reputations? The Bulletin sym-
pathises with the great bowler ; hut he should recognise
that to every man there comes a time to lake in sail.
That time, for Turner, may not be yet ; but hi tier meet
it half-way than lag superfluous on the stage. Look at
Bill Beach 1
* • * *
Five horses started for the V.R.C. St. Leger,
three of them being “ swell ” performers The Harvester,
winner of the V.R.C. Derby ; Bonnie Scotland, winner of
the A.J.C. Derby ; and Oobbitty, winner of the Caulfield
Guineas. This trio finished third, fourth, and fifth behind
that respectable, but hitherto second-class animal, Preston,
and the very third-rate Maroon. Such is classic racing in
Australia.
Opinions differed very much as to The Har-
vester’s inglorious failure in the Leger. Some people
thought he ran like a stale horse, others made him out to
be “ soft” in appearance and style of finishing. Probably
the training tactics adopted with Mr. Sam Cook's obtrusive
favorite, who was prepared for a sale that didn’t come
off, took the heart out of him. One thing is clear, if the
touts were not conspiring to crack up The Harvester they
are absurdly incapable critics. They all agreed in the
yarn that he was looking splendid and galloping bril-
liantly.
The Bulletin made one defensible comment
on the Newmarket Handicap chances—Esau was tipped
as a likely winner if he could “ last out the six furlongs
at top speed—a doubtful point.” Esau didn’t last much
longer than five furlongs. He was leading the field even
after passing the distance-post, but had no say in the
actual finish. Barbarian (who must have won, &c., &c.)

By the way, Laundress had pretensions to win
the Newmarket on her “form ” of the previous Saturday.
The writer would have picked her in, say, eleven tries.
Which doesn’t excuse the folly of offering any advice re
the Newmarket, save advice to leave it alone. Book-
makers are not rash men, but the average price at which
the three placed horses started was 85 to 1. Vanitas at
6 to 1, split a couple of 50 to 1 chances.

in most cases. On paper the mare, always a public fancy
since she got placed for the Melb. Cup, had the better
chance. Poor public! They provide the added money
which owners race for, yet the necessary object of every
“ stable” is to keep its business as dark as possible. How-
ever, the public are withdrawing their patronage from
the game, and the added money at Flemington is ac-
cordingly growing less every year.

An affecting Carbine poem appears in the
Arous. The noble 'orse is supposed to be singing a fare-
well song to the readers of that Freetrade journal, and
the two last verses run thus:
“ And now, good-bye. To each and all a last and fond
farewell.
Yes, pat me, Hickenbctham, trusty trainer, truest
friend,
And unbuckle this old headstall, while I turn my head
to tell
The people of Australia that I’ll love them to the end.
“ Throw open all the windows, and throw wide the stable
doors,
And let me see my public in this hour of parting dire.
Perhaps some day a eolt may come from England to
these shores,
And in my son they’ll recognise the image of his
sire.”
Poor old Carbine ! He won 36 races in his time, yet there
are bards capable of putting this nauseous stuff into his
mouth.

Mr. W. R. Wilson, it will be seen by an advt.
on page 20, is disposing of St. Alban’s estate and all his
racehorses per medium of a £125,000 lottery, which, it
may be predicted, will soon fill, as prizes of the sort
offered have an irresistible attraction for the average
Australian citizen.

While the tendency in N.S.W. and Victoria is
towards the reduction of horse-racing stakes, in Maori-
land, where the totalisator holds sway, the prizes are ever
on the increase. The N.Z. Cup, which is, after all, but a
mere provincial affair—Auckland, Dunedin and Wellington
all having their cups of nearly equal importance—has
just been raised to £2OOO. Why, with the totalisator at
Randwick, we could have a £BO,OOO Sydney Cup, with
£5OOO divided amongst the runners-up, and a couple of
thousand spielers compelled to work for their living. The
Bulletin holds its hand right up and votes for the
totalisator.

The Albion Hotel, the old-time Melb. coaching
and sporting hostelry, has been swept
away. Long ere Victoria had been honeycombed with
non-paying railway lines a former landlady (Mrs. Yewers)

ran the Albion at the time of his Wollomai Cup-win, and
went out of it with a fortune. could do
well anywhere ; when a boy of 15 he ran away to sea, and
turned up ten years later with two ships of his own. The
remainder of his career has been correspondingly lucky.

R. H. Stahl, of Des Moines, la., IT. S. A.,
says: “My little (laughter was, for seve-
ral years, afflicted with salt-rheum, none of
the many remedies prescribed by the physi-
cians doing her any good. When we had
about given up all hope of curing her, my
wife suggested the use of Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla. We tried it. and before one bottle had
been taken, a great change for the het'.cr
was noticeable. We continued the treat-
ment, and a thorough cure was the result.”

BLAKE PUMPS.
In addition to the original SINGLE BLAKE PUMP, we also
make two different styles of Duplex Pumps—the “ STANDARD ” or
“REGULAR” and the “SPECIAL.” The “Standard” or “Regular”
Duplex Pumps are constructed with Composition Piston Rods, Stuffing
Boxes, Valve Seats, Valve Bolts and Pump Cylinder Linings. The Water
Pistons are also made of Composition, and are suitably packed with
Adjustable Fibrous Packing, adapted for Hot or Cold Liquids.
The “ Special,” although not of so high a class as our “ Standard ”
Pattern, are nevertheless well and faithfully made. They are through-
out heavier and stronger than other
makers’ pumps of same class and
selling for same price, and we
guarantee them to give thorough
satisfaction. For contractors’ work,
and where a more expensive pump
might not be justifiable, they are
specially suitable.
All parts are interchangeable,
and can therefore be readily dupli-
cated in case of accidental break-
age. Blake's “Standard Pattern” Duplex Pump,

When buying The Bulletin at any wharf
or railway • station, make sure, before paying,
that you get the current issue, as a number of
people have been making money by trading off
ancient copies, on the unsuspecting.
A Sydney Domain orator contends that the
State should open a bureau with a staff of barbers
to shave impecunious unemployed.
A Queensland policeman, when arresting a
man, was “ bashed ” on the jaw with a bar of iron
that knocked out 17 teeth, tore away part of the
gum, and injured the jaw ; yet that constable held
his grip on the man and produced the bar in
court.
Grazing farms are being thrown open in
Bananaland for the encouragement of poor set-
tlers. A grazing farm in a rabbit-infected district
requires to be fenced with wire-netting. This,
with survey-fees for farm of 20,000 acres, will only
cost about .£1000!
“Hallo, Dumpy!” says the honorary
magistrate, “so you’ve been stabbing a man, have
you? I’ll give you six months, Dumpy,” “But,
your Worship,” interposes the C.P.S., “you
can’t—it’s against the statutes.” “Oh, hang the
statutes !” says his Worship • “ let’s have justice.”
Down South, the Government subsidises a
gun and a man to fire it at one o’clock. Some-
times he does so. Recently, this wreck’s liver
told him to go to sleep in the daytime, and he did.
At half-past two or thereabouts he awoke, and
found that the gun hadn’t said anything at the
proper time. He ran for the powder, rammed it
in, and pulled the lanyard, leaving the rammer in
the gun. Then an astonished populace heard the
one o’clock gun explode 90min. after its time, and
the rammer flew out of the bore and demolished
two panels of fencing. The people don’t mind the
90min. delay, and they pass over the damage to
the fencing, but they are now easting about for a
man who will have sense enough not to waste a
rammer without hitting a K.C.M.G.
A Melbourne civil servant, with two or
three different capacities, recently got his capa-
cities badly mixed. He was head of a depart-
ment and also trustee of a public park, the man-
agement of which was vested in his department.
He resigned his trusteeship, and the local inhabi-
tants petitioned the Minister to persuade him to
withdraw his resignation. The Minister sent the
petition to him in his departmental capacity ask-
ing him to interview himself in his ether capacity,
and persuade himself to continue in office, if pos-
sible. Then the residents got up a deputation to
the Minister, and the official was included in his
departmental capacity, his business being to ask
the Minister to use his influence to induce him to
stay on against his own wish. Then the Minister,
despairing, suggested that if he would go and
argue the matter out with himself he might
possibly arrive at some definite decision, and the
deputation withdrew to untie itself.
Nervous sufferers will tiud it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page
19 of this issue.
A Victorian town is in the throes of an
amusing scandal. A while back several of the
leading local lights subscribed towards a locket-
and-chain presentation for the local mounted
policeman, who was about to be transferred to an
even calmer “beat.” When the constable’s bit of
jewellery came to be carefully weighed and con-
sidered, the subscribers, as a body, were dissatisfied
with their purchase, and several excited meetings
took place. The town couldn’t see sufficient
locket and chain for its money, whilst the parties
who laid out the cash refused to submit a state-
ment of accounts. Result, summonses against the
collectors and the jeweller who supplied the goods
for conspiring to defraud the beneticiare of “ £5,
or more.” For the defence it is said that a con-
siderable amount of subscription money was
“blewed” in the process of canvassing hotel-
keepers, and a receipt for a larger sum than the
jewellery cost was given in order to provide funds
for the expense account. Moral—never make
presentations to policemen.
In the window of a religious bookseller in
Pitt-street, Sydney, is a map of Australia show-
ing in blood-red the various 0. of E. missions to

100 and Wexford-street, Sydney, are unmarked ;
likewise Durand’s-alley and the Rocks.

doubt as to the figures submitted, or the descriptions given of the various prizes.

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘ Bengers Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never be able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Benger's
Food.’ From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of
Its value no other would be
used."
Which ?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Is your mother at home ?” inquired the old
parson, as he took his long-accustomed seat in his
best parishioner’s drawing-room.
“ Oh, no, she went to Queensland, last week, to
stay with Effie—l thought you knew.” The old
man leant forward : he was very deaf.
A discreet lady-caller here interjected a remark
about the weather, but it was no use, for he
answered, beamingly—
‘‘Dear Effie—well, well, I am glad—boy or
girl ?”
The discreet lady glanced in despair at her com-
panions. The gentleman visitor gazed fixedly
into space—the young daughter of the house
seemed flurried.
“ Well, really—you see, we don’t quite—l mean
it’s neither.”
“Eh ?”
“ Neither !”
“Neither? Really? You don’t mean—well,
that’s very ex ”
There was a violent ring at the door-bell, and
the girl fled : a moment later she returned.
“It’s BO'IH!” she said, holding out the tele-
grain.

The Maoriland old - age pension scheme
turns up again in a new shape. A New York
paper calmly announces that,(iovernmentis “con-
sidering a scheme for poisoning all residents after
they have attained their seventieth year.”
Apparently it sees nothing remarkable about such
an idea, and regards it as just the sort of thing
that might be reasonably expected in Maoriland.
Any horrible thing may happen quite naturally,
provided it happens a long way off, wherefore
many Australians still believe in the S.M.
Herald’s great fiction of a year or two back
about the execution of 130 priests, in one gory
batch, in the city of Mexico.
An American has lately been travelling
Victoria giving the following diplomas, which
undertakers are exhibiting in their windows :—•
The Australian School of Embalming.—This is to
certify that Mr. Blank, of , has attended a course
of instruction and practical demonstration, and has
qualified himself for embalming and preserving the dead.
In witness whereof this certificate is issued,
Melb., Dec., ’94. Lecturer and Demonstrator.
The chief practical benefit sought is that the
decomposition of Victorian corpses may be
delayed pending the arrival of friends for the
funeral; or during transit by rail. Wanted next
some ’cute Yank to arrest the decomposition of
certain Melbourne financial live bodies.

Loekyer’s Sulphur Hair Restorer, quickest,

Conneetieut, U.S., has got a patent hang-
ing machine which strings up the subject auto-
matically when he steps on the trap; but local
parsons object to the labor-saving appliance, be-
cause it flies in the face of Providence, inasmuch
as it “ compels the criminal to be guilty of his own
death.” Society compels scores of innocent people
to be guilty of their own death weekly, and yet
the parsons are with society all the time. If the
Connecticut criminal didn’t walk on to the patent
trap,, he would probably be prodded on, and so is
no more guilty of his own death than the Aus-
tralian crank who walks calmly up to the gallows
instead of lying down and compelling officialdom
to drag him up by the heels. Straight-out legal
murder secures the blessing of the “cludgy,” but
a suggestion of suicide gives them moral horrors.
The man who takes the Scriptures literally ceases
to be a reasoning creature. The Connecticut auto-
matic-hanging system simply means that the
hangee is “ told to resign.”


N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice
Company, Limited .
Purity is the watchword of the N.S.W. Fresh
Food and Ice Company. Its life is a system :
steam its spirit; 35 engines for ever driving ! night
and day the whirr and roar of the big machinery!
It has the largest refrigerating plant in Austral-
asia, and while its outer buildings consume in the
blaze of the summer’s noon, the roofs and walls of
its inner chambers are heaped with tons of ice and
snpw. High and low, through handsome engine-
rohm and spacious food-store, through cosy office
and ice-bound vault, shine the brilliant eyes of the
electric-light.
The late T. S. Mort founded the Company in
’•6l, investing in it, altogether, <£250,000. But not
until ’74 was the Company
(formally incorporated under
'its present title. Two sons
•of the founder—Mr, Laid-
Hey Mort and Mr. William
Mort—are among the present
directors*
The front b u ildings at
head-quarters face Harbour-
street, and the ice-chambers,
store-rooms, work-shops, en-
gine-rooms, stables, yards,
and the rest stretch back
over Several acres to the
wharves and railway-station
of Darling Harbour. The
land, in fact, was long ago
reclaimed from the waters
of the sea. Captain Broom-
field, one of the directors,
who came to Sydney in ’42,
remembers how the salt
water flowed right over
where the buildings are now,
•and even up to Harbour-
street itself.
In the matter of railway
c image and water carriage,
bills Company is singularly
I Ijst. Tire line runs straight
ii t) the yard, and the trucks
with their loads of milk, or
b jef, or mutton, wheel to
the very doorways. This,
says Captain Broomfield,
means a saving per 1 annum
of many thousands of
pounds.
At the wharves the yards
of the ships’ masts almost
touch the_roof of one build-
i"g, so that > oft cold and hungry days the
sailor; climbing to the mast - head can look
down into the most tempting of bakeries
and get eye- surfeiting visions of substantial
pies and seductive pasiry; or, when the sum-
mers sun is splitting his head, he can watch
the frosted turncocks and 16ng to lay his brow
against thbm and to chew icy items. Refrigera-
tion is not always refrigeration; it is the heaven
of the ultra-convivialist.

Among the customers of the N.S.W. .Railway
Dept., the Company ranks as one of the largest.
It is, therefore,: no surprise thslt thefseeretmy, Mr.
Fotheringham, speaks with glowing appreciation
of Mr. Eddy. • “ Prior to his management, our
trucks Whuld, be tied in a knot at Redfern ; our
troubles with the railways were frequent and dis
heartening. But late years have brought about
happy changes, and, when Mr. Eddy accepted a

recognition. But I expect he’ll understand that
we congratulated ourselves the most.”
Every day trains from Ri verstone rush in with
tons upon tons of mutton and beef ; while from
the pleasant district of Illawarra, and the fresh
country of Picton and Camden, come thousands of
gallons of milk and cream. The milk-trucks, with
the exception of wheels ami springs, were built by
the company’s workmen in the yard ; they are
fitted with Westinghouse brakes, to run on
passenger trains; the company owns them and
keeps them in repair. Their construction ensures
perfect .ventilation, for in the milk business this is
a most arbitrary provision ; the empty milk-cans
are always returned with their lids off. Each
truck is divided into a top and bottom compart-
ment, and thus carries two tiers of milk-cans.
After delivering its load of milk, a truck is
cleansed throughout with water and steam.
The meat trucks are not sectioned; otherwise
they are built like the milk trucks. Being exclu-
sively devoted to the company’s business, they
are kept scrupulously clean, but they belong to
their builders, the Government Railways Depart-
ment. So do the ice waggons—massive air-tight
packing oases, holding inside their 4-inch thick
walls six solid frozen tons. Over all the sun-
scorched lines of the N.S. W. railways go the ice-
waggons with their cooling loads.
The milk and butter expert supervises hf»
department with vigilant circumspection. He and
his efficient staff of inspectors selected the farms
on which the Company relies for its milk supply,
and at frequent, though wisely irregular, intervals
they thoroughly examine farm and cattle and
farmers. These healthy farms are situated in the
Picton, Camden and Illawarra districts ; granted
good seasons to each district, they produce about
the same quality milk.
Healthy farms, healthy cows, healthy farmers
should, in laymen’s logic, ensure healthy milk;
but the milk expert is on the alert for natural
deteriorating influences, which are both subtle and
unexpected. “ Weeds grow apace.” On the best
of farms they' will spring up in the night, and the
best of cows, eating them, will give milk unfit for
food. But Nature has a worse freak, for the
changed herbage that a cow gets by being turned
from one good paddock into another will some-
times generate in her stomach a gas which, taint-
ing the milk, brings the expert’s condemnation
upon it. The watchfulness of the inexorable
expert does not cease with the conviction that
milk is free from deleterious elements; he requires
it, on being tested, to reach the Company’s, not
the Govt., standard.
Here is the contrast

The expert objects to the 88| per cent, of water in
the Govt, standard ; a praiseworthy objection !
The art of eliminating chance is exemplified in
the stringent conditions imposed by the Company

upon its farmers. It accepts only such milk as
satisfies the expert’s test; it pays only for milk
so accepted ; it can reject milk without incurring
obligation with the farmer. Further wise arrange-
ments, systematically speaking, complete this
elaborate and perfect supervision.
Of course, such scientific care brings a splendid
reward ; for, though milk affections are numerous
and insidious; though Government inspectors
have, over and over again, investigated all the
workings and methods of the business, and, with-
out hint or wink, suddenly analysed the milk at
farm, railway-station, head-quarters, and cart
delivery ; though never a week passes in Sydney
without some dairyman being fined at the Police
Court for selling adulterated, impure, or inferior
milk, the N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Company,
in all its long and useful history, has never once
appeared as a delinquent.
A SECTION OF A MEAT-CHILLING ROOM.
Ou the farms, the milk is first reduced in tem-
perature by the “Lawrence Cooler” to 50° in
winter and to 65° in summer. Then it is run into
the transit cans, and conveyed to the local railway
stations, where the Company’s employes receive
it, place it in the trucks, and guard it upon the
train. Arriving in Sydney, it first undergoes the
severe testing process, and having gained the
expert’s approval, it is poured into the great tanks
of the cooling-chamber, and, in one hour, brought
down to 32°, the freezing point of water, 4° more
than the freezing point of milk. It is then ready
for delivery.
To pass from the rush and traffic of an Aus-
tralian city and the dusty furnace of an Australian
summer into the chamber where the milk is chil-
ling, soothes the senses and charms the soul. The
pure rich milk is within a few inches of the tops of
the great tanks, and fills the chamber with its
delicious sweetness. The refreshing cold gives
sun-scorched, jaded Nature fresh lease of hope and
life; above, below, on every side the air is freezing
and the electric-light is flashing over snow-covered
ceilings and pipes and pillars of whitened cold.
At the chamber’s end, where the ice and snow are
never disturbed, they have formed for themselves
a fantastic grotto, glistening with pendents and
delicate wreaths.
The cooling-tanks are of steel, tin-plated ; the
“agitators ” in them keep the cream equally dis-
tributed ; after each lot of milk has been cooled
and run off, the tanks are cleansed with water and
steam. (9team alone would harden the milk left
about them).
The milk for the service of the ocean-liners and
other steamers, is frozen solid in 3gal. tins. It is
first subjected to a “sterilising process,” which is
nothing more or less than scalding, and prevents
the milk, when being frozen into solid blocks,
from separating into two elements—one the water,
the other the fats and solids.
The milk for suburban morning delivery is
carried from head-quarters to the suburban depots
by waggons which leave each morning at 3 o’clock;
while for the city delivery over 60 milk-carts are
constantly employed. These milk-carts, whose
clean appearance inside and out tells the tale of two
daily washings with water and steam and thorough
ventilation afterwards, have been built upon the
premises. They take two-thirds of their milk
round in the early morning, and the remaining
third in the afternoon. Should a cart bring back
any of its milk, that milk is never sent out again.
In everything connected with the carts, their
horses, and drivers—details so minute as to be too
tedious in narration —there is seen the same
unceasing system, the perfection and precision of
one section of a great elaborate machine. No
wonder that the Company’s milk reputation
spreads far and wide ! No wonder that it sends
milk daily a whole summer through from Sydney
to Bourke 1 No wonder its milk is consumed on
the sumptuous tables of palatial steamers in every
ocean and sea of the globe !
# • •
The butter-making department is ruled over
by the expert with all the rigor and discretion of
his practical wisdom. The cream comes from the
Company’s own creameries; the expert tests it for
purity and quality ; he pays the farmer for it on
its butter value.
The cream is never touched by even a finger’s
tip; it is churned by “ Evenden’s lightning
churn,” and the latest butter-making machines
complete the process. Weights and scales are
dispensed with ; a machine cuts the butter in-
tended for N.S.W. use into pounds and half-
pounds, and stamps upon it the Golden Star and
the Company’s name. This butter is wrapped in
the “ Golden Star ” paper—a vegetable parch-
ment, tasteless, odorless and grease-proof—and
placed in a chilling chamber where the temperature
is 38°. Tons are made daily, and daily a consign-
ment is sent to Wollongong.
The butter for export is packed by the solid
half-hundredweight in square boxes lined with
the vegetable parchment, and is frozen hard as a
stone. These boxes, which are received 50,000 at
a time, are made of New Zealand white pine, and
the wood, having been seasoned, kiln-dried and
machine-dressed, gives off neither taste nor odour,
and is not susceptible to mildew.
The Company’s butter-milk and “ skim-milk ”
are given to many charities.
* # •
The company’s beef, mutton, and pork undergo
the crucial examination of the meat expert; one
diseased or faulty carcase would not only ruin a
whole frozen flock, but would put an ugly blotch
upon the company’s unblemished reputation.
The dressed sheep, on arriving by train, are
passed, 24 at a time, suspended on bars, straight
from the meat-truck to the ingenious weighing-
machine ; they average from 50 to 551 b. each;
now and then one will weigh 1001 b. They are
never handled by the employes; after being
weighed they travel suspended to overhead wheels
right into the chilling-room, where the freezing
process begins. The temperature of this room
when empty is 25°; and, as dressed sheep average
70°, and as 1500 are put in during the short space
of 3a hours, the room’s temperature rises to 45°.
By the end of 24 hours, however, the room is
down to 29°, and the sheep to 33°. The latter
temperature is taken by running a knife into the
thickest part of the leg, and inserting in the orifice
a special form of thermometer. The knife comes
out of a frozen sheep quite dry. At 33° of tem-
perature the carcases are transferred to the
freezing rooms, where they gradually freeze down
to 15°. Then they go into the store-room, where
the biting air registers s°, and where they are
literally buried in a frozen vault. Here they are
bagged and stacked in the same fashion as in the
refrigerating chambers of the ocean liners, and
they are so hard that a knife point will not pene-
trate them. Although sheep can be frozen in 12
hours, the slow and thorough process adopted
takes from two to three days.
Beef to be frozen is cut into quarters, but the
trade in beef is nothing like so brisk as that in
mutton, and while the frozen sheep are numbered
in tens and tens of thousands, the quarters of beef
can be reckoned by the hundreds. Hence one
cold-chamber suffices for all the needs of beef-
freezing, which, with an ordinary quarter, takes a
week.
5° Fahrenheit is an ominous number, but it must
be felt to be realised. Notwithstanding the in-
tensity of the cold, the Company’s Australian-born
workmen stand it remarkably well. Like the other
workmen, they wear chaff-baps around their boots
to protect their feet; and, so fortified, they stick to
their work as Laplanders might, and stack frozen
sheep and blocks of ice for hours and hours a day,
year in and year out.
• * #
The horses which draw the milk-carts and
waggons so briskly are broken by employes. A
horse which is broken in the country needs extra
breaking in town to get used to trains, so the Com-
pany buys the green colt, puts him into double
harness and introduces him at once to the Sydney
street railways. All the harness that the horses
wear is of the Company’s make. A walk round
the yards shows the well-groomed horses in their
long line of stables, the splendid white buggy
horse which is driven by the manager, Mr. Pate-
son, the blacksmith’s shop, the hay store, the
granaries, the harness room, the cart factory, and
the harness-making establishment. In another
part are piles of new-washed cans with their lids
off for ventilation ; and rows of clean carts ready
to go out for the afternoon delivery.

The bakery supplies the Company’s restaurants
at 92 King-street and 23 Royal Arcade. There
the honest toiler may regale himself with sausages,
bread and tea for 6d., while admiring the hand-
some furniture and decorations, which, in the
King-street shop, cost .£6OOO.
The Bakery has ovens of the most approved
type, each lift, by 13ft., and lighted with elec-
tricity in mica-faced lamps. Science, always
turned to practical account, has produced inven-
tions for shelling almonds, cleaning raisins, &c.
All the pastry is machine-made.
Thus human hands do not taint the goods—not
even the dexterous ones of the chief cook, who,
at the time of visit, was delicately ornamenting
the icing of a wedding-cake. Said he, by way of
explanation, “ No one who buys our wedding-
cake or other edibles ever gets divorced ! Do you
know why? Well, after a man and his wife are
made one, if they use our goods their food digests,
and each feels self is that one; but if they eat
things that won’t digest, one or other discovers
that they are 2, and fancies that he or she is that
2. What trouble comes ! and how simple is the
whole secret!”
This cook should sit at the right hand of Divorce
Justice Windeyer; for his side-light thrown upon
divorce, revealing it in all the frightful horror of a
phase of indigestion, is worthy of scientific inves-
tigation, A Judge or a crocodile might shed
tears over it, but the tears would be tears of joy.
The Company’s fish and game shop, in King-
street, is one of the finest shops in the whole
street, but scarcely one person in a thousand who
sees it is aware that the shop-window, with its
unique display, is really a cold chamber, consum-
ing per day hundreds of pounds of ice.
* * #
New South Wales is dotted with the Company’s
agents ; they are in every suburb of Sydney, and
in every country town; and the Company has
often been asked to open business in Melbourne
and Adelaide. It monopolises the .English,
American, and Maoriland fresh fish and game
trade; the Orient steamship Ophir is specially
fitted for its service; so are the Union Company’s
steamers running to and from Maoriland ports,
while the Arawa brings the Company American
fish from ’Frisco. It supplies nearly all the poul-
try, fish, milk, butter, and ice used by the steam-
ship companies. It freezes for anyone, and intends
to revolutionise the ice-trade. A strange pecu-
liarity of Sydney and N.S.W. people is their
inability to realise the value of ice as a preserver
of fish, meat, milk, and butter.
The Company goes strongly along the high road
of success; between the sth Jan. and sth Feb. it
sent 78,000 frozen sheep to London, whence the
manager, Mr. Pateson, has just returned after an
eight months’ business trip. It is continually
adding to its buildings; a butter store-room with
a capacity of 100 tons has just been completed,
and a new milk-refrigerating plant of 8 tanks, to
carry 22,000 gallons, has been in work but a day
or two.
Many visitors inspect the works, but consider-
ing how interesting inspection proves, how the
Company grants every facility on mere application
at the office, and how Sydney’s population is fast
approaching the half-million, the many visitors
are comparatively few.
• # •
The engines are all new ; the oldest claims but
nine years’ service. The effect at night in the
best ice-engine room is almost dazzling when the
electric-light plays upon the three splendid engines
with their handsome finish and sparkling polish.
Two of them bear the stamp of De La Vergne,
and each will make daily 40 tons of ice or freeze
2000 sheep. The third is the latest addition ; a
beautiful 30-ton model designed by Mr. Auldjo,
and built at the works of the Mort’s Dock
Engineering Company. The ice-engines are five
altogether; they can make 70,000 tons of ice a
year.
The Company has been sending hares and
rabbits for the past three seasons to London, and
at the time of visit these could be seen in one cold
chamber by frozen tens of thousands. It is on
the premises here that the famed Maoriland blue
cod is smoked—with sawdust only.
Local fish, game and poultry, meant for speedy
consumption in the home market, are not placed
in a very cold chamber, but it is cold enough for a
Polar bear in the chamber where the stiff Van-
couver salmon is set off with white, and where the
boxes of Maoriland white bait are encrusted with
snow. Here, side by side, are seen English hali-
but, turbot, kippers, herrings and bloaters;
Maoriland flounders, soles and blue cod ; Ameri-
can salmon from Vancouver and Sacramento.
In another cold chamber are Maoriland venison,
pheasants and quail, while Australian black-duck,
teal and pigeon fill the poor human soul with in-
finite longing and overwhelm the temperance of
the ordinary mind with the wild mad joy of the
epicure.
# # *
The ice store-room contains some hundreds of
tons of ice—just a goodly slab of the North Pole
lit up by the electric-light, instead of by a six
months’ sun or the Aurora Borealis. An old man,
thin and dried (for he has worked here eight hours
a day for 20 years, and refrigeration is to some
extent dessication), is stacking ice with bare hands.
His boots are thickly wrapped around with chaff-
bags to protect his feet from the intense cold;
close beside him peeps the handle of a shovel from
its bed of snow.
He is well and vigorous and cheery; he has only
been ill once in the 20 years—that was when he
worked in the sun one day and caught the very
devil of a strange illness. He loves the ice-room,
he says ; and while he is speaking the visitor bolts
suddenly for the door. Those who wish to know
more may go and find out, go and yarn with
the lively Esquimaux preserved in his ice-cave, go
and yarn and stack ice, and get fingers and nose
and feet frost-bitten, as one foolhardy investi-
gator did heretofore.

average of about 2oz. When he gets an air-shaft put

start crushing and make a big fortune, if he doesn’t fall

soon show if there was more “ watah there, don’tcher-
know.” Their last scheme was a “1000-head battery on
the Swan ” and a few railways. Their present is a Cool-
gardie Chamber of Mines and Commerce to be run on the
same lines as that of Johannesburg.

Registrar Gill, who acted as warden at Cool-
gardie in Mr. Fianerty’s absence, is drafting mining
regulations for Westralia. Heaven knows they are badly
wanted. But some Jumpers and their friends'had not to
wait for Gill. They got an Act passed making a bad
regulation good;, as far as they were concerned, and
quashing all actions at law; but this piece of busi-
ness is not over or forgotten. It is now receiving the
attention of the English press. It is hard to make some
people feel that the good' old sandal-wood day's have gone,
and that w'ith the new era men w'ho have some knowledge
■of right and wrong;have come 1 into the country.

A Talk with an Optician.
An optician who has fitted spectacles upon vice-
regal noses; whose lenses give normal sight to the
60 year-old eyes of Gov. Norman; who has
ensured accurate vision to the weather-eye of
prophet Wragge; who has rectified the unusual
combination of ■ presbyopia; astigmatism, and
myopia that troubles Chief Justice Samuel
Griffith, ought to be a scientist in his profession.
And the dignitaries quoted regard Mr. Greenfield
as an unmixed blessing : they send their friends to
him and give him glowing testimonials to be used
at his discretion. There is scarcely a prominent
public man in Queensland —from, the Governor,
Griffith, M‘llwraith, Lilley, andi Ministers of
I'm Crown to justices, doctors, I lawyers, and
M.’sP.—who does not wear a ; pair of this
optician’s glasses. So, while his partner, Mr.
Barraclougb, manages the Brisbane branch of the
business, Mr, Greenfield ought to reap success at
the establishment he has started in Sj r dney.
The glasses which Chief Justice Griffith wears
when’on the Bench have probably no fellow of
Australian make; they do the work of three
different pairs of glasses. The upper part of each
lens corrects the astigmatism and myopia of
vision, and enables the Chief Justice to survey the
whole court; the lower portion rectifies the pres-
byopia and astigmatism, rendering the writing
and reading of notes a normally easy task. The
Chief Justice’s fine testimonial certifies that Mr.
Greenfield is a competent optician, in whom the
public may place confidence, and no decision ever
given by a Chief Justice could have graver portent
than this has for one special section of suffering
humanity.
The eye, whose miraculous construction and
beauty of adjustment fills the inquiring mind with
fear and wonder, is treated by public ignorance
and unprincipled speculation with a clumsy
callousness nothing short of criminal. The man
who in the mad rage of personal combat strikes
his opponent blind, is summarily dealt with by
law. But the cold-blooded pretender, who calls
himself an optician, may prescribe spectacles and
glasses to a helpless community, may pocket his
fees, and laugh with impunity at the misery he
causes. f
The offences of such unqualified practitioners
have become so loud a scandal in England that
the profession’sheading representatives are form-
ing themselves into a society to fix a standard of
examination, which shall "be submitted for the
approval of Parliament, with the intention of
getting a bill passed for exterminating the charla-
tan from the opticians’ ranks.
Mr. Greenfield has this movement most dearly
at heart, and keeping himself in touch with the
leading Englishmen of his profession, he intends,
tlie moment that the needed law is enacted in
England, to use it as a precedent and try for a
similar enactment in Australia.
Some of the saddest phases of human ignorance
and folly are brought under the notice of the pro-
fessional optician. Mr. Greenfieild has chanced
upon 13 or 14 men and women, who, staring with
the naked eye at the sun during the last transit of
Venus, produced atrophy of the optic nerve, end-
ing in total blindness. He could: show thejintem-
perate lover of drink and tobacco more than one
blind beggar whose dismal plight is directly due
to atrophy of the optic nerve, primarily induced
by excessive drinking and smoking.
He grinds all his lenses, manufactures all his
spectacles, fitting them to individual sight and
form of face, thus securing all possible comfort for
the wearer. He has spent nearly 20 years in
sight-testing, and he was the first to introduce
his scientific method to Australia. His system is
so complete that, granted the eyes are free from
disease, a person’s exact age can be ascertained
by it.
Mr. Greenfield holds forth very warmly upon
‘‘ rule of thumb ” tests and the farcical examina-
tion conducted by pretended experts, and he de-
nounces the nonsensical toy employed by some
operators to delude the public—“ petty tricks and
artifices which would be ridiculous but for the
seriousness of the evils that they cause.”
“ You can understand how much simplicity and
trust are at the mercy of the charlatan when I tell
you that scores and scores of people come to me
convinced that their eyes are diseased or defective,
and who, after due inspection without charge, go
away rejoiced to know that their eyes are normal,
and that their only want is a short holiday in the
country, or at sea, to rejuvenate a jaded system.
Charlatans’ victims wearing concave lenses realised
with a start the danger they were running when I
changed these lenses for convex ones.
“There are people whose sight will be perfect for
another 20 years, coming to be examined every six
months. One man with remarkably good sight
was under the delusion he was going blind.
People working in a bad light get eye affections
which disappear when proper lighting is allowed
them.
“More men than women wear spectacles in Aus-
tralia, but, of the two, women are perhaps the
more credulous. Nothing - could exceed the inno-
cence of a young lady I attended the other day ;
she attributed her myopia (short-sight) to an in-
growing toe-nail 1 Not a few simple loving
mothers associate their child’s squint with asuper-
stition, or think it is wholly the effect of measles
or whooping-cough, or of looking at a bow upon a
bonnet; and they are very grateful if I explain the
common cause of squint, which is hypermetropia,
or over-sight.
“ Some folks, who would look upon a person wear-
ing a tight boot as a great fool, put colored glasses
upon their own noses and permanently injure their
eye-sight. They have a craze for self-experiment
upon the most delicate and precious of the organs;
they use deep-black shades, when they need only
the faintest tinge of color, and even that only
under irritating conditions such as the midday
glare and dust. With proper colored glasses the
eyes, when possible, grow stronger until they are
restored to their normal power, and then the
glasses are discarded altogether.
“Human eyes have strange freaks. One Sydney
clergyman has odd eyes ; he looks at the con-
gregation with his right eye, while he reads the
Bible or prayer-book with the left. Sir Arthur
Palmer, of Brisbane, has eyes similar to these.
One whimsical optical defect is double vision—
unfortunately mated in the lay mind with splen-
did conviviality. But it is a sad thing when the
soberest of men always sees two lamp-posts in-
stead of one, or mistakes one sovereign for two
pounds sterling. I have overcome the embarras-
sing failing in four people during the last few
weeks.”
Mr. Greenfield speaks with deep commiseration
of the North-West Queenslanders, about Blackall
and Aramac, where the sand-fly pest rages summer
after summer, and sandy-blight brings wretched-
ness upon man and beast. Another Queensland
feature that struck him was the number of men
whose eyes had been injured in blasting accidents.
He made a pair of spectacles for one lucky unfor-
tunate, whose vision escaped, while the whites of
his eyes were blackened with burnt - powder
grains. “ I never saw or heard of such a case.
How his sight was preserved can only be explained
as a miracle. ”
. “The obviously natural cause of defective vision
is the stealing on of age. People who follow
country avocations, and those engaged in manual
labor, develope premature defects of vision only
as rare exceptions to a rule. Sailors and farmers
have exceptionally good long-range vision.
“Some people tinker with their eyes as if they
had two or three dozen pairs to fall back upon
should they destroy the ones in use. We never
charge for testing a person’s sight, yet youths of
23 or 24 will go and select so-called pebble spec-
tacles from amongst a job stock, wear them, and
cripple their power of vision for ever. One 23-
year-old youth I found wearing spectacles which
would suit his eyes when he reaches the age of
eighty. The common, so-called pebble spectacle
is wicked trash that injures the eye more than
ordinary ‘ window-pane ’ glasses do.”
Myopia, or short-sight, is a defect whose symp-
toms are conveyed in the popular name. Hyper-
metropia, or oversight, may escape its victim’s
consciousness for a considerable time; then the
great strain of the eye-muscles brings on headache,
eye-ache, inflammation of the eyes, trouble when
reading, double vision, and .other distresses.
Astigmatism is chat odd affliction (which makes
the upright line of a black cross look blacker than
the horizontal line, or vice versa. It will cause a
picture of uniform brightness to appear brighter
in places than in others.
Asthenopia, weakness of the converging mus-
cles, or muscles which balance the eye, may allow
vision to seem perfect in a room or in the open air,
but reading continuously for five minutes or more
causes dimness of sight, the running and blurring
of words together, attended with irritation or pain.
Photophobia is a weakness of the retina, which
betrays itself in fear of bright light, and the mani-
festation of a desire to shield the eye from the
slightest glare.
Such are a few of the chief defects, as briefly
outlined by Mr. Greenfield in colloquial terms.
It is in the cities where the students are, where
the clerks and printers work with artificial light,
and where the doctors, barristers and pressmen
often seem to live for mere close application,
that we get the defects known as hypermetropia)
myopia, astigmatism, asthenopia, photophobia’
and the 52 diseases of the eve.
“‘Malformation can be easily induced in the eyes
of children of tender age, by keeping them poring
over books and lessons when they should be out
in the open, giving their eyes the healthy stimulus
of exercise at different foci. I have made glasses
for many such little sufferers.
“ Cle.nent myopia is only slight, but I
saw an extreme case the other day in a lady who
could not tell her daughter by sight 18in. away.
I prescribed her a pair of spectacles, and she now
recognises people quite clearly upon the other side
of a wide street.'
The manufacture and adjustment of artificial
eyes forms a big feature of Mr. Greenfield’s prac-
tice, and, granted a socket in good order, he says
he can put in an artificial eye with such natural
effect that it will defy the discrimination of a
quick detective.
Mr. Greenfield intends very soon to go on a
part-professional tour through the
.. - \
principal towns along the Southern line of the
N.S.W. railways.

so that any patron breaking or losing spectacles

IMPRISONED ON A SHIP.
The steamship Normannia, from Hamburg,
arrived in the port of New York orlSaturday,
Sept. 3rd, 1892, with eases of cholera on board.
Many of the ship’s company.bad died; on ..the. pas-
sage. At Hamburg and elsewhere in Europe the
disease was raging. The authorities in America
were alarmed lest the scourge should he introduced (
into that country, Hence they quarantined the,
Normannia, with every soul of her passengers and i
crew. The writer was a passenger, nlt was an,
awful time. Death was among us and on aUi
sides of us. Nobody knew who next would fall.
We were imprisoned. Liberty never seemed so.
fair, nor so far. We could neither fight nor fly,.
There we were—hundreds of us— perfectly well,
and yet bound together as with chains, that the,
health officer of the port might see whether the,
plague would not yet break out in bur midst..
When at last —after weeks of this—we were set on,
shore, men lifted their hats and reverently said]
“ Thank God! ’’
This was being shut up under conditions Ip.
make it horrible and fearful. Yet, any form of,
incarceration is bad enough. Here is a womans
for example, who says, “ 1 never moved a yard},
jrom my own doorstep for twenty weeks /” I ten ow.im
house was a prison to her. " Who had'sentenced/
her? A judge? No; a power greater and) more
pitiless than any judge.
Her tale runs thus : In April. 1882,'whilst living
at Lasher’s Farm, Old Sampford, Essex, a tin-
broke out, and the family were burned out of
house and home. We have no call to remark on
such a calamity. The very thought of it is fit to
make one shiver with dread. For most of us it is
like the world coming to an end to experience such
a disaster.
Well, what happened after that the lady shall
tell in her own fashion—the best of all fashions,
because it is plain and straight to the point. She
says: “Owing to our bedding being damp from
exposure, I took a bad cold, which brought on
rheumatic fever. For fourteen days I was eon-
fined to my bed, and for twenty weeks I nevet
moved a yard from my own doorstep. Aft. r a
time the fever abated, leaving me weak, languid j
and low. At first I had i sickening taste in the .
mouth, and a poor apt etite. No matter how.-
simple and light the food was, I was afraid tb eat,
for it waasure Jto give.me pain at the chest -andi
sides ; so I often had to loosen my corset and un-
dress myself during the day. I could not bear the.-
weight of my clothing.
“I was constantly spitting up a sour, frothy
fluid, and had a gnawing pain at the pit of the,
stomach—like hunger, and yet different. It waw
with difficulty I voided the kidney secretion, aiuS
my bowels, ankles and legs began to swell. I goit
worse; I was in agony night and day, and eorfd
not put ray foot on the ground, Soon afterwards,
a husky CQugh took me, and my throat filled with
a thick phlegm. I could not sleep, and wag never
easy. Later on, I had often to sit up in bed, for I
felt as if I should choke. i■
“ Year after year L continued t.& suffer in Jthis
way, growing worse and wbrse, utilil I despaired
of ever being well;again. But who can tell when
trouble will come, or when relief? A wonderful
Providence is over aIL . :
“ One day in June, a hook came by post de-
scribing Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup and what
it had done for many poor sufferers. I got a
bottle from Mr. Suckling, medicine dealer, and
after taking it for a short time all pain left me,
and I gradually gained strength. By taking aii
occasional dose I have since kept in good heijtli
and can eat and digest any kind of food. (Signed)
Mrs. Lydia Queen, Moor End, Great Sampford,
via Braintree, Essex, Aug. 24th, 1892.” i 1
Now, in order that Mrs. Green’s clear andl
truthful statement may be of use to others -(as
she desires it to be), We must add a word or two,
The bad cold she caught at the fire no doubt
“brought on” the rheumatic fever (as she •
relates), but there was something back of the
cold, for a cold never causes rheumatism. The ■
rheumatic seeds, or poison, must already lie in ,
the blood ; and that poison is always created by
■pre-existing indigestion and dyspepsia, whether •
the sufferer knows it or not. This is proved by
the fact that Mrs. Green’s chief ailment for ten.
years after the fire was not rheumatism, but
indigestion and dyspepsia and dropsy, which is,
•one of its results and symptoms. When fim-
digestion was finally'righted by the remedy she.
alludes to, all her apparent maladies ceased)
together. Why? Because she had but one, as we.
have said.
Ah, yes. Disease is a stern gaoler. And how
sweet (and cheap) is liberty, obtained by Mother
Saigel’s help.

“ HOMOCEA ” CURES EVERYTHING.
LORD CARRICK says Homocea cured him of
bleeding piles, when all else failed ; that he gave
some to a labourer who was lamed by a stone
falling upon him, whom it cured. A woman had
a pain is the elbow and could not bend it for a
year, and it cured her, and another used it for
scurvy on her leg, and it was doing her good—one
letter closes from him with the words, “ It is the
most wonderful stuff that I ever came across.”
LADY VINCENT, 8, Ebury Street, London,
says : “ Homocea is such an incomparable appli-
cation for Rheumatic Neuralgia, that she wishes
to have two more tins sent.”
LORD COMBERMERE says Homocea did
him more good than any embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.

;l Dear Sir, Your
ointment, called
Homocea, was found
to be the most soothing
and efficacious unguent
that 1 could possibly
have for my fractured
limb, as it seems to
yetain longer than any
other, that oleaginous-
ness so requisite for
perfect and efficient
massage. The fault of
embrocations generally
is that they harden and
require warmth, whereas
yours, besides being particularly aromatic, is as
soft as oil, and almost instantly mollifying in the
case of severe inflammation.
“ Yours faithfully, Henry M. Stanley.”

[FOR THE BULLTIN.]
I paddled up the river.
I was tired of civilisation and its products, so I
turned my back upon the city and bore up against
the tide. The river set its current against me and
bore down for civilisation and the city.
• • •
The river was an Australian river, and its
winding reaches were framed in gnarled stems
and twisted branches of quaint device, in
creep rs and drooping, lance-shaped leaves, in'
rough boulders and grim caves where the black
man had crouched beside his boomerang and
devoured his feast of shell-fish.
But the caves now bear the legend of Smith,
Brown and Jones; the boulders ad vertise patent
soaps; among clearings in tortuous gum-bush
gleam the white turrets of the modern villa ; on
the slopes the creepers have been cut away for the
straight, trim beds of artificial garden.
The legends and the soaps, the villas and the
gardens, are all products of civilisation.
I paddled up the river.
# • •
Suddenly I came upon a Relic of Romance.
A dismantled chimney, a ruined wall over which
trailed fresh green leaves, an old horse browsing
where a cottage room had been, some soft-eyed
cattle gazing at me, all the elements of a domestic
idyll. I stepped ashore to shed a few tears over
the idyll and analyse the elements ; some of them
resolved themselves into disused boilers pervaded
by a peculiar odour.
Then I remembered. I stood on the site of a
boiling-down establishment which had once pol-
luted the air.
The boiling-down process was a product, and it
had moved down the river.
I paddled up.
* # •
At a bend of the stream rose a tall build-
ing, with straight lines, jutting outhouses and
gabled roof. Some terraced cottages stood near,
also straight-lined and gable-roofed. Opposite,
twining greenery and rich underscrub and starry
flannel-flower nestled in the curve under the
shadow of the cool cliff. Here, utilitarian energy
bristled in the glare.
I went inside the building. It was a factory,
with whirring wheels and ponderous grindstones
and huge vats, all used in the production of a
fancy food for digestions spoiled by civilisation.
Strong men were busy among the machines, slight
women were busy in the packing-rooms. I spoke
to one of the girls ; she was young and not un-
comely ; her head was bent and her nimble fingers
folded squares of cardboard into box-form and
pasted on the paper covers.
“ How many can you make in a day ?” I asked.
“ About three hundred,” she answered in a
monotone, her fingers still folding.
Outside, the mullet were leaping, the loose-
leaved branches were idly waving to other
branches in the water, the laugh of the kukuburra
pealed in the distance.
Inside, the sun streamed hotly on pale faces and
tired fingers.
I looked at the girl, her face was dainty and
wistful. _
“Don’t you sometimes hate it?’ I said.
The girl looked at me, and answered :
“Yes.”
She was a product of civilisation and was drift-
ing down the river. I paddled up.
« « •
At last I lighted on my camping-ground.
It was roomy and retired, protected by a shore of
black ooze and a cliff undisfigured by names ; a
waterhole was near at hand. I contentedly lighted
ray camp-fire, and sat down to meditate on pro-
ducts.
Suddenly a boatful of them arrived and took
possession. They were undeniable : male product
in speckless flannels, straw hats and city respect-
ability; female products in gay draperies and city
smirk.
I fled to my waterhole. There the water
dripped with a musical patter down the ruddy
cliffs ; the yellow “ s'peckle-eye ” flitted about the
branch3S with cheerful chirp; the sunbeams
quivered through the interweaving leaves; the
locusts played their bagpipes with a subdued
drone. I was listening to it when the product in
flannels swooped down on me, armed with
curiosity and conversation.
“Nice place,” he said, annexing my waterhole ;
“ nice soap,” appropriating mine ; “ nice weather,
nice camping-ground, nice to get away from the
city now and then.”
When I went back the products were gathered
round my fire, crooning “Daisy Bell” prepara-
tory to going down the river. I paddled up.
• * *
On the oozy bank I spied, afar off, a flam-
ingo stalking in the mud. On nearing, my
flamingo resolved itself into an elderly gentleman
in a red shirt, paddling for bait.
This looked like close intimacy with Nature. I
made advances to the flamingo, which presently
took a bath, resumed human attire and conducted
me over a thriving orchard.
I admired a fruitful vine on a barren rock. I
marvelled at a peach-bearing tree which had
sprung into existence in a crevice. I stood
beneath a forty-year-old apple-tree which formed
a natural bower, and dreamed of the children Who
had frolicked under its boughs.
The flamingo’s voice broke in :
“ I don’t get half I used to for them apples,” it
said ; “if I couldn’t do my own cartage by road
I’d give the land up; it don’t pay these days.”
The flamingo was also a product.
I paddled up the river.
• * *
I swerved aside to enter a sinuous creek,
just wide enough for my boat. On one marshy
side tall rushes grew, on the other old trees
caressed my head with their drooping boughs. The
water rippled under the keel, and a dog’s baying
echoed far away.
I drifted up to a thickly-set orchard, with a
soft carpet of green weed beneath the peach-and-
nectarine-dropping trees. In the foreground a
group of men were busy sorting fruit and packing
it in market cases.
The master stood up, a tall, well-built young
fellow, and as I stepped on shore he came forward
with grave courtesy—
“ You are a stranger,” he said, “and”—his
glance wandered uneasily from my unkempt
beard, doubtful garments, and bare feet, to the
boat. She was trim and shipshape. His glance
returned, satisfied—“ And an artist?” he con-
tinued, “a good many come our way. You are
welcome. The orchard is more interesting further
on and you will find some fruit to your liking.”
• • •
So I had lighted on Paradise at last and
civilisation was in the rear. As I lay under the
enclosing boughs of a pear-tree that had seen
three generations, catching glimpses, between the
clustering fruit, of tree-ferns guarding scarlet
tomato and ripening water-melon, with the murmur
of the creek, the buzz of the bee, and the hum of
the fly in my ear, I felt I had nothing to reproach
Adam and Eve with. Their little interview with
the serpent had not robbed me of Nature’s spoils.
# • •
But another sound disturbed ray reverie.
A sibilant sound recall'ing city products. Creep-
ing forward stealthily, I peered through the
branches, and there, in the gathering shadows, I
spied a pair—of the species known as larrikin.
They were hard at work, too, and the bags beside
them suggested weight.
A hand fell on my shoulder.
“ Will you help me?’’said the quiet voice of
the sturdy young farmer. “We are evenly
matched, and if we surprise them it will be a sure
thing.”
It was a sure thing. Within half-an-hour the
invaders were on their way towards the hospitable
police-station. Apparently they were waste pro-
ducts. I had come painfully near civilisation
again.
« • •
“lam much indebted to you,” said the
farmer. “They would have escaped had I lost
time going to look for my men, and really this
sort of thing is not to be stood. The rights of
property are sacred ; I see you are with me there ?”
I was not with him there, because I have no
property. My boat was a hired one. But I
understood.
Still, I was sorry. It struck me that my farmer
was a product, too, in his own simple fashion, and
I had not yet wandered far enough.
I wished to paddle up the river.
* * •
“Wait,” said the farmer; “you must
come up to the house; we both need a drink after
that little affair.”
“ This stuff won’t harm anyone,” he added pre-
sently, holding up the aromatic golden liquor to
the light. “You don’t find this brand in every
house, and where you do it’s not always genuine.”
I glanced at the brand, it was “ Bertrandt and
Co.” Bertrandt was the rich godfather whom I
looked to for a legacy.
“Do they dare to tamper with it?” I asked
righteously.
Tampering with Bertrandt’s brandy might
affect my legacy.
“Not with this,” laughed the farmer ; “ I have
special opportunities for securing the real thing,”
and he whispered a word in my ear. “We all
like our little comforts, and we like them good,”

“Yes,” I answered absently, “we like them
good.”
Was it really five years since I had written to

PISTAHIO.
Queen Victoria, they say, intends creating
an order of merit for British literary men, in three
grades:—
A vulgar grin the mocking face
Of every honest scribe suffuses—
They see, by faith, our gracious Queen
Ba-decorating all the muses.
The Ambitious One,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ A man rises by pluck and ability.”— Cook, M.L.A.
“ My father,” said the youth, “I am ambitious ;
Of place and power and glory is my dream ;
Fain would I taste for once the»dear, delicious,
Intoxicating draught of Honour’s stream.”
“My son,” replied the sage, “there hath come
o’er thee
A fever not confined to just a few ;
The path to Fame and Honour lies before thee—
The means to gain it nobly are but two.
“Be wise, O son. Full many a man hath risen
Because with counsel keen and weighty word
He made the thoughtless throng around him
listen
And moved the souls of mortals as they heard.
“Be brave, O son. We hold the names immortal
Of all the noble souls who knew no dread,
Who faced the King of Terrors in his portal,
They stir—they move us yet —they live, though
dead.”
“My father,” said the son, “the means thou
showest
I find too full of peril and of pain;
Perchance a gentler, easier way thou knowest
For softer souls the prize of power to gain ?”
“ Another way,” replied the prophet hoary,
There is for those who fain would rise and rule;
Full oft the path that leads to power and glory
Is held by fools—away and be a fool!”
Q.
P.LUFTIG.
“Husband and wife don’t go tandem,
now.”—Mrs. Chant.
“ Rich men are indolent, rich nations in-
dustrious. ” —W HATELY.
A “ society ” pair have had their four-
year-old daughter photographed nude in Mel-
bourne, nearly life-size, and exhibited in a case
downstairs.
It is complained that a man drawing a
paltry pittance from the Melb, Decayed Wes-
leyan Ministers’ Fund, is making a large income
in business.
Padded stockings are now advertised in
London as a corollary of “dress reform.” The
knickerbocker is advocated as essential to health,
but doctors and actors can testify that the padding
of legs will be almost as uncomfortable and injuri-
ous as the superseded skirts. The women with fat
and unshapely limbs will,' presumably, try to com-
press them into delusive proportion. As legs will
have so much more to do with lovely women’s matri-
monial prospects than is now the case, these false
pretences may yet be made punishable by law.
What with removable hair, five-guinea teeth,
washinsr complexions and (now) padded legs, small
wonder at the frequency of divorce.
Many gentlemen residents in the country
often require a first-class suit at a reasonable
price. Messrs. Hordern Brothers, Pitt-st. (only),
Sydney, are making to order for 455. extra quality
serge and sergerette suits, perfect fit and satis-
faction guaranteed. Write at once for patterns

The Greatest and Most Successful Practitioner in the World.
His mode of treatment is unfolded in his last work (nearly 100 PAGES)
PRlCE—Posted, Sealed-£l, including ONE MONTHS MEDICINE, for
any Disease.
But few of noted specialists have sprung into
emi ice and an immense practice as Surgeon Langs'
a rc ident and practitioner at 121 Coliins-street, Mi
bourne. His name has become almost literally a house-
hold word ; almost every other man you meet has a
wonderful story to relate of some almost miraculous cure
he has pet ormed in am acute or chronic case of long
standing, where other physicians have failed. He ad-
dresses himself in particular to cases that have baffled the
skill and science of other doctors. His name is a suffi-
cient guarantee of a perfect cure of every case he under-
takes. Consult him this day. It may save you much
mental and physical suffering, and add golden years to
your life.
YOUNG MEN.
You will find this distinguished doctor your best
friend and benefactor. If you are troubled with weaken-
ing dreams, unrefreshing sleep, a tired gloomy feeling, and
loss of energy, ambition and self-confidence, which im-
pair both your body and brain, and absolutely unfit you
for study, business, or the proper enjoyment of married or
single life; if you are suffering from these or similar symp-
toms you know the cause. Do not allow false pride and
sham modesty to deter you in seeking relief. Before it is
everlastingly too late, consult this reliable old specialist,
who thoroughly understands your trouble, and can treat
it with unfailing success.
MIDDLE AGED MEN.
There are many of you afflicted with weak, aching
back and kidneys, loss of mental and physical power ana
vigour, wasting weakness, and not unfrequently accom-
panied by an impairment of the general health. In justice
to this celebrated specialist it can be truthfully stated that
in all such cases of middle aged men, as well as of young
men, his success has been almost invariable.
PRIVATE
troubles of every kind, name and nature,
treated far m advance of any institution in Australia ; fe-
male complaints, liver, lung, chest, throat, stomach, blad-
der, kidney and heart disease; rupture - oiles, fistula,
hydrocele and kindred troubles.
