" Homer was the greater genius : Virgil the
better artist.” The phrase is of eternal applica-
tion. This man appeals to the intellect—that to
the emotions : rare indeed is he who feels deeply,
yet not more deeply than he thinks, and at the
height of his Art is able to communicate the
living touch that warms it into an ideal Nature.
* * * * *
In Alex. Montgomery’s stories the appeal is
almost wholly intellectual. He rarely excites
passion ; always interest and admiration of his
skill. He builds his tales as he might build a
chess problem, and the pleasure they bring is very
much akin to the pleasure attending a chess pro-
blem’s solution. He is the scieneed story-teller—
making infallible point after point, and clinching
all in a dexterous climax—as opposed to a
natural story-teller, like Becke, with his
transcripts of South Sea Island life in
which Nature is everything, and the narra-
tor’s art is confined to the recital of his vivid
emotional impressions. Montgomery knows
more : Becke has felt more. With Montgomery
it is the telling that most excites admiration :
with Becke it is the tale. Both men are good ; and
each is the better in his own way. Becke has no
style; his vocabulary is purely colloquial; he is
lost among irrelevancies and verbal excrescences ;
his ore continually needs purging from the dross.
Montgomery’s styleiscleanand finished ; of itskind
it is all but perfect; to cut a word, a line, would
be to lose an effect; he edits himself too severely,
perhaps, for there is a certain hardness in his
work, a want of atmosphere, of shade and contrast.
And the supremacy of his intellect has dulled his
emotions. Becke makes three-fourths of his capi-
tal from the simplicities and complexities of sex-
passion : the Woman is surprisingly wanting in
Montgomery. His humor, too, is rare and satur-
nine : Becke bubbles over when he has a good
thing. Nor is Montgomery ever carried away by
his story, as Becke is. Becke’s best yarns tell
themselves—the points are made by instinct—so
keenly responsive is the teller to comedy or
pathos. But Montgomery is less nervous and
more Northern, less natural and more cynical,
and remains always master of himself and his
subject—too much master, which is not good.
The essence of good fiction, as of good poetry, is
“ emotion remembered in tranquillity ’’—but even
in the tranquillity there should be 75 per cent, of
emotion. And Becke gets nearer this ratio than
Montgomery.
* * * *
“Five-Skull Island and Other Stories’’—which
is the title of Montgomery’s little book (posted
from this office, Is. 9d.) —gives hardly more than
a taste of his quality; and though his level is
always good,, it is not here always at his
highest. Nevertheless these fifteen lightning-
flashes on the men and manners of the Malay
Archipelago are well worth treasuring. Mont-
gomery does not, indeed, get the broadest
foundation for his work. His stories are still too
sketchy, too detached and objective, to be classed
with the best examples of the conte. No matter how
brilliantly scenes and phases are pictured, if they
be isolated the picture lacks permanence. To be
enduring, literary work must be brought into con-
tact with some primal fact of humanity : there
must be a universal “ moral ” in it. Not the
“moral” of the Sunday-school tract, dragged in
brutally in violation of perspective and pro-
bability, but the natural moral which, abstractly
considered, every incident of life has-for all things
living. Australian writers run too much to the
easy, detached, realistic sketch—not too much if
it be considered that they are young and learn-
ing, but too much if they are judged with-
out reference to local considerations, as artists
merely. Looking back over Bulletin contri-
butors, Mannington Caffyn is perhaps the
one who rose highest as an artistic story-teller.
There are others who have gained as great, or
greater results, but their work will not bear re-
reading so often. Of current writers, the clever
“ Alba Durion ” is one who approaches somewhat
to the ideal. He has something of the under-
current of meaning, the all-human reference, that
our dogma demands.
* * * *
And a consideration of the work of the best
short story-writers brings justification of the
dogma. The French Maupassant is justly con-
sidered a master —perhaps the master-of the
conte; and all his best tales have the asked-for
“moral.” There are scattered throughout his
dozen volumes detached sketches of excep-
tional brilliance— sketches which make, perhaps,
a greater momentary impression ; but it is not
these that one returns to again and again. It is in
the human stories—the stories in which you, the
reader, might be actor, and not the individual
stories, which depend on some peculiarity of
person or circumstances, which you, the reader,
do not possess or do not know —that Maupas-
sant’s power is greatest. Take an example from
scores which present themselves—“ Regret.”
* * * * -
It is an old man, and a wet day—a cold, dull, depress-
ing day in autumn. The old man gets up, presses his
nose to the window, ana shivers. The rain is drip, drip,
dripping down continually. Such a gloomy day 1 And
there are only gloomy days for the old fellow now—he is
sixty-two, and an old bachelor, and the joy has gone out
of his life.
The joy 1 But he has never had any joy. If he could
cherish the memory of something he had done ; if he had
had adventures, great pleasures, success, any sort of
satisfaction I But no ! there was something lacking in his
nature—a certain constitutional timidity had held him
back when his fellows went forward —he had never had to
struggle, but had eaten, and slept, and risen, and eaten,
and slept, and risen—day after day spent in the stagna-
tion of mediocrity ! And now—very soon—he wag going
to die —to die ! —and his life so empty of everything worth
living for 1
He had not even been loved. No woman had
slept on his breast in complete abandonment. He
knew nothing of the delicious anguish of expectation,
the divine thrill when the hapds touch, of
triumphant passion. Outside the rain dripped monoton-
ously : inside he sat by the fire in his dressing-gown—old
and cold. . . . Yea: his life had been a failure—an
utter failure.
Yet ... he had loved! -Secretly, sadly—as was his
nature —but how he had loved! It was his old friend
Mme. Sandres, the wife of his old comrade: she lived
opposite to him. Now —she was , . . yes, she must be fifty-
eight, at least. How pretty she used to be —so tempt-
ing, rosy, smiling, sweet 1 And old Sandres was never
the man for her. “ If she had loved m» long ago—if she
had loved me ! ”
He remembered the walks they used to take, the three
of them, along the Seine—close by. There was one day, one
afternoon . . . they had gone for a picnic . . . and old
Sandres had gone to sleep after lunoh . . . and Mme.
Sandres had taken his arm for a little stroll . . . how
he remembered it! There was something curious
about her that day —she leant on his arm, chattered,
said she was just drunk with the Spring—“just
drunk.” And he looked at her, and longed, and
courage failed him. He could not even speak 1 And
she—she made a garland \yith grass and water-
lilies, and put it on her head, and asked him, “Do
you like me like this?” And he did not answer—he
found nothing to say. And how curiously she had looked
at him when he suggested it was time to go back ! She
was so silent going back : she did not lean on his arm.
Why?
Could it be ... ? The old fellow tortured himself
till he could not rest.
He would go over—yes, he would go over now, and ask
her.
So he dressed himself, and went over the road in the
rain, and asked for Mme. Sandres. She came—disturbed.
Was he ill ?
No, he was not ill; but he wished to ask her some-
thing—he could not rest till he had asked her. Did she
remember that spring-day on the Seine, when Sandres
went to sleep after lunch ?
Oh, yes ; she remembered it well.
“Well . . . that day . . . if I had been . . .
if I had been . . . enterprising . . . what would
you have done?”
Mme. Sandres answered frankly: “ I should have
yielded, moil ami.”
Then the old man, with his head down, went out into
the street, through the pouring rain, and walked, and
walked, and walked. At last he found himself on the
spot where they had been the day of the picnic—the spot
he remembered.
He sat down under the bare, shivering trees and bunt
into tears.

Tiiis mutilates Maupassant shockingly ; but that
is not the point. The point is that in every man’s
life there are missed joys- regrets—and conse-
quently this story has a direct, personal, intimate
appeal to every man who reads it. The motive
recurs continually—it recurred in analogous cir-
cumstances in last Bulletin Xmas Number,
where Arthur Watts, in the course of his story
“A Case of Affinity,” remarked that “a lost
opportunity is an awful thing to have on one’s
conscience.” It is just this crude, familiar sum-
mation which Maupassant has expanded into
artistic and permanent form. So in a hundred
other cases he takes a trait common to humanity
and around that twines his story.
* * * *
Take “ Le Bapteme” for another example.
The scene is in a country village, among rough
peasant-farmers. There is a christening, with its
attendant consecration and simple feast in which
the friends of the parents take part. As the
story opens, the men are gathered at the father’s
farm waiting for the women, that they may go in
procession to the church. “Women are never
ready in time.” The nurse comes out, bearing
the two-months child, bedecked with ribbons;
then the mother; and the procession Of rela-
tions and friends is formed, proceeding slowly
to the church, where the child is baptised.
The young priest is its uncle, the brother of
its father.
When the ceremony is over, the proces-
sion returns —all walking faster as they think
of the dinner. The nurse, a little tired, asks
the priest to take his little nephew for a
moment: and he takes the babe awkwardly, not
knowing how to hold it. Familiar peasants ask
jestingly : Isn’t he sorry he can never have one
like that? He does not answer, walking fast,
feeling a strange wish to hug his tiny burden.
When they are seated at dinner, there is a
continual fire of agricultural pleasantries about
marriage and offspring. The priest, used to the
rough manners of his parishioners, takes no
notice. He is seated next to the nurse and child,
and he considers the little human larva with a
reflective attention, feels' a sudden lively tender-
ness, a little sad, for this fragile being, the son of
his brother. The nurse is troubled by the
child, and the young priest again takes it
from her. There seems to him to be in the
helpless infant a mystery of which he has never
thought : he is astonished, profoundly moved
before this incarnation of a new soul, this great
wonder of a life beginning, of love awakening, of
the race of man continued eternally.
The dinner goes on ; and the diners get warm
and noisy. The child commences to cry. A rude
voice tells the priest to give it the breast, and the
witticism is greeted with a storm of peasants
laughter. But the mother comes and takes the
child to an inner room, soothes it to sleep, and
returns.
At last the feast is finished. The priest has
disappeared, but no one remarked his absence.
The young mother rises to see if her little one
still sleeps, going into the room on tip-toe; and
returns alarmed, declaring she has heard some one
moving there. All the men get up, drunk and
-threatening ; and the father takes a lamp and
hurries into the room.
He finds his brother, the priest, op his knees.near
the cradle, sobbing, with his head on the pillow
where rests the tiny head of the baby,
* * » *
And again the moral comes. The scene is no-
thing ; the persons are nothing; they are merely
the vehicles of a forcible appeal to the universal
sentiment of fatherhood.
* * * *
Of course, it needs Maupassant’s genius to get
Maupassant’s effects. Without his art there is
nothing. The subjects lie ail around us—it is the
workmen that are wanting. In the Brady-Phil-
lips murder, for example, there is material than
which Maupassant would demand nothing better.
To imagine the reason for the crime, the circum-
stances surrounding it, and then to make that
reason, those circumstances, so obvious that the
result would seem inevitable; to portray Phillips’
character, the workings of his mind, his actions,
his emotions before and after the crime; and
then ter show the embryo Phillips lurking in all of
us—dormant, dwarfed, or active—but necessarily
present in right of his and our humanity—this
would be a fascinating, an absorbing task for a
great artist. Well : we may grow one yet.

The eelebration of “ Sarah Bernhardt’s Day ”
in Paris on Dec. 8 was memorable indeed.
The great actress was first banqueted in the
largest hall in Paris, which yet proved in-
sufficient to hold the company. Sardou toasted
her as “ not merely the great but also the good
Sarah ” ; and she sobbed her thanks. Then came
a representation at the Renaissance theatre, which
she manages, Sarah taking two rbles to perfec-
tion; and at the close a scene which has fired
the pen of Lond. Times correspondent—
“the unequalled scene which seemed the con-
ception of a poet’s brain —I should perhaps say
some madman’s, if an entire city, one of the most
enlightened in the world, had not been joining
in it.”
Mme. Sarah Bernhardt is seated on a throne of flowers.
She wears a white dress, a light \ eil covering her head
From THE SNETON.
and at mo ents concealing her eyes, wet with tears. The
stage is a mass of flowers. Around her a throng of
Academicians, poets, authors vf oolii sexes, actors and
actresses join their acclamations to those of the public-
Then more flowers are brought. The Society of Student*,
by the mouth of its president, M. Tissier, is the first tc
greet her. The delegations of the schools of law and
medicine, of St. Cyr, of the Polytechnic and the Ecolt
Centrale occupy boxes, and by their acclamations cm
phasise the tribute of M. Tissier. Then come the poeti
Frangois Coppde, Oatuile Mendds, Edmond Haraucourt
Andrd Theuriet, and Edmond Rostand, who, one by one,
stepping forth from the groups, advance towards'Mine
Sarah Bernhardt to read each of them a sonnet in hei
honor. I cannot help quoting ten lines from the sonne 1
of M. Edmond Rostand, the young author of La Pnn
cesse Lointaine, not merely noticeable for their finely-
chiselled form, but interesting to English readers as
indicating the esteem in whioh is held the name of
Shakespeare : _
En ce temps sans beautc, seule encore tu nous restes,
Sachant descendre, pfi-le, un grand escalier clair,
Ceindre un bandeau, porter un lys, brandir un fer,
Reine de l’attitude et princesse des gestes. . . .
Avide de souffrir, tu t’ajoutas des coeurs ;
Nous avous vu couler—car ils ooulent —tes pleura,
Toutes les larmes de nos ames sur tes joues.
Mais aussi tu sais bien, Sarah, que quelquefois
Tu sens furtivement se poser, quand tu joues,
Les lfevres de Shakespeare aux bagues de tes doigts.
And—they know how to honor artists in France

Reading “A Humble Enterprise,” one com-
prehends easily “Ada Cambridge’s” fixed femi-
nine vogue. It is a pleasant, unpretentious story
which tells nothing in particular, and tells it very
well. A Melb. millionaire’s clerk dies, leaving
his family ill-provided-for. The family sets up a
refreshment-room, where the attractive daughter
serves tea and scones. The millionaire’s family
patronises the tea-shop, and the millionaire’s son
marries the attractive daughter who serves the
scones. This is all the plot; the rest is clever
embroidery, done naturally, in good English, with
some skill of characterisation. It is not usual, of
course, for Melb. millionaires’ sons to marry tea-
and-soones girls; but the feminine mind still
clings to Romance, and probably this touch of
Romance pleases the author almost as much as it
pleases her readers. As fine Art, as strong Litera-
ture, one cannot praise the book; but in its
humble way, with boarding-school limitations
duly allowed for, “A Humble Enterprise” could
hardly be better.

Little items :
Mallee Cookie: “Re Kipling’s ‘gray Gothav’n speok-
shioner ’ (they pronounce it ‘ speckshoneer ’ in Dundee),
a‘speckshioner ’ is, or was, the name given to the first
harpooner of an Arctic whaler. One of his duties was to
superintend the ‘flinching’ (i.e., getting the blubber
from a captured whale), and the Dutch word for fat or
blubber is speck— hence, probably, the name.” Speck is
still a well-used German word for “fat”—is, in fact,
common Teutonic property. But its English use (good
dies, still give it as a current English word) is now almost
wholly restricted to nautical vernacular, where so
many antiquated words linger longest. “Speck,” says
Webster, is the blubber of whales or other marine
mammals ; also, the fat of the hippopotamus. Thus a
“speckshioner” is a blubberer—a “gray Gothav'n blub-
ber-cutter.” (‘‘Speck falls-” is nautical for the falls or
ropes used in hoisting the blubber, &c., aboard). . . .
R. R. Holmps, librarian at Windsor Castle, is compiling
a sumptuous life of Queen Victoria, to which the good
lady herself will contribute notes and reminiscences.
The volume will include illustrations of the most memor-
able incidents in her 60 years' reign—the frontispiece
b ing a representation of the late John Brown’s un-
paralleled legs. . . . “ A.C.” : To offer a prize for transla-
tion would simply be to invite inundation by stiff, stilted
incompeteuoies—like yours. Good translators can trans-
late for the pleasure and profit of a good translation. . . .
Percy drawings for the Jan. number of Pall Mall
Magazine are in point of draftsmanship no better than
some that, he has previously done, but the composition,
and especially the effort at idealistic treatment, give his
admirers a novel pleasure and his work a keener promise.
It is a pity the accompanying vers s are so flat and stale.
. . . S.M. Herald has lately sparkled with “ Watuba’s ”
conversational transcripts in the manner of W. Pett Ridge.
“ Waniba” is the pen-naine of H. I. Low (“ A.8.C.” of the
Herald s “ Fugitive Notes ”• column), and his work is fre-
quently bright and clever. .. . Capt. Mahan—the “In-
fluence of Sea-Power” man —is writing what he
will try and make the “final” life of Nelson,
whom he has already tackled in articles. . . . J.G.H.:
“Melb. Argus missed the point Id Gay’s “A Se*
Maiden ” as completely as it could. Even if the
poet had compared the maiden’s breath with a gale
‘ Only a very boisterous breath indeed should be brought
into comparison with a gale would not he a reasonable
objection for reason already pointed out. As it is, it is a
blunder.
Her breath in sweets doth more abound
Than fragrant equatorial gales
is plain enough. The idea of fragrance is not only
‘ paramount ’: it is in sole possession.”

origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of

speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

Perhaps you are one who only thinks of the
UTILITIES, one who eschews everything but
what is strictly necessary. You’ve a penchant
for FLANNELS, hut have a DERRY on SILKS,
and when there’s HOMESPUN about you can’t
see the occasion for bothering about PLUSH and
VELVET. Simple and good is your motto ;
you’re almost a Quaker, though not quite, and
you’d rather see your money in the bank than on
vour back, and dividends are better, say you, than
Ribbons and Laces. Well, have your own way.
We provide for all sorts and sizes.
Or perhaps you are of another class. A world-
ling, if you will, floating down the stream of life,
with “youth at the prow and pleasure at the
helm,” you want to dress well and to look well.
The eyes of the fair are upon you, and you would
win their smiles. You want Clothes and Hats
and Boots, Gloves you must have, and a thousand
other things you crave for. Rings, Lockets,
Gems, exquisite Neckties, Shirts galore, good
CIGARS,- and TOBACCO of the best. You’d
like them all, wouldn’t you ? You can have them,
sir, at our store for what is, when compared to
what other stores are asking, a mere song.

The Brumby’s Death .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas only last night I was leading them west-
ward
O’er hills bathed in moonlight, thro’ forests of
gloom,
Past reed-beds that sang by the deep water-
courses,
Thro’ thickets of starry-white jasmine in bloom :
My beautiful troop ! with their wind-toss’d manes
flying,
Their hoofs flashing fire as they wheeled on the
plain—
Ah ! never thro’ desert or bird-haunted forest
Shall I lead them in moonlight or shadow again.
It was only last night that we came to the clearing:
The blaze of the camp-fire —our halt in surprise,
And the whirr and the sting of the death-dealing
bullet,
The last maddened gallop, the fast-dimming
eyes.
Then I sank on the reed-beds, they fled in the
darkness
Still westward—their hoof-beats seemed ringing
my knell;
Was there one, do you think, gave a thought of
the leader
Who, stricken and helpless, lay still where he
fell?
I had led them of yore to the hills of grey granite,
I knew where the creepers hung thick o’er the
pass
That led to the vale in the heart of the mountains,
The clear, crystal river—the green slopes of
grass.
Ah, me ! those were days when we met in the
morning
And galloped in glee while the sweet breezes
sang,
And the echoes came up from the hollow, red
ridges
As over the gravel our hoofs lightly rang.
I can follow in fancy their flight thro’ the dark*
ness
Bereft of their leader, still hurried by fear ;
Will they wander till lights of some lonely out-
station
Shine out, or a horse-bell sounds far off, yet
clear ?
Will they turn then and, seeking the swampland
behind them,
Forget their wild panic in longing for me,
And hasten to guard me ?—for bright eyes are
gleaming
And swift shadows hasten past thicket and tree.
How weirdly the dingoes are howling around me!
The wings of a night-hawk brushed lightly my
mane;
The eagles will shriek for their feast on the
morrow,
But my troop will be with me nor leave me
again
Till these dim eyes grow bright, and far to the
westward
I lead them, forgetting this night and its fear.
They are slow—they are late—ah ! I would that
they hasten—
The stealthy night prowlers draw silently near.
Far away in the hills that have guarded so firmly
The granite-ringed pastures the wild horses
know,
They are feeding knee-deep in the grass and the
clover
While red grows the east from the dawn’s tender
glow.
And another as leader looks proudly around him,
Sleek-skinned and fleet-footed, well fit to be
head,
Whilst far in the reed-beds the eagles have
gathered . . .
One might have remembered as westward they
fled !
Queensland.
ETHEL MILLS.
One Australian University assistant in the
bacteriological department has been seized with
pronounced tuberculosis. There was no family
history of consumption, and, as all conditions
pointed to his having picked up the microbes in the
laboratory, he was advised to leave, and a post
found for him elsewhere so that he should suffer
no income loss by leaving. Only the healthiest
should take part in such work, for the microbes
coming there are very fine and large, and only too
anxious for business whenever even a common
cold makes a nice soft nest.
The individual who purveys the “ Literary
Gossip” for S.M. Herald occasionally betrays a
too-intimate knowledge of his native literature,
In his chronicle of the past year’s publications he
observes :
There was a fair amount of work published by Aus-
tralian writers during 1896. Among others we may men-
tion Lawson’s “ While the Billy Boils,” and “ In the Days
when the World was Round.” . . . Lillie Turner’s
“Lights of Sydney,” Louise Hack’s “When the World
was Round.”
The world is round for a good many people just
after the strangled-fowl season.
Australian slang, writes “ T. D.” to The
Bulletin, seems subject to frequent modification.
Four or five years ago the youth of the “ push ”
went down to Chowder and proceeded to “ shot ”
rocks. Now he merely “ slings ” them. Anything
which commended itself to him was “good iron”
—more than one good-natured policeman wore the
sobriquet. The correct term at present is “ all
right.” To “poke borak” is undoubtedly a de-
velopment of “ barrack,” for which some uncon-
vincing Bulletinist has found a far-fetched deri-
vation in a French dictionary.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1897.
A Great Function.
A few months hence Queen Victoria com-
pletes the sixtieth year of her reign. She
will then have decisively broken the record
of the two imbecile kings who, until lately,
were first and second on the British list in
the matter of longevity, and dreary con-
tinuousness, and protracted remaining in one
situation. They were a solemn pair, those
two old-time monarchs — George 111., the
blind lunatic from Germany, and Henry
111., the weak-minded son of a father who
died from over-eating, combined with over-
drinking and rage and beggary and unmiti-
gated disaster. Victoria, unlike them, pro-
mises to put up her record in peace and
quietness, and great rejoicings are to prevail,
if: they can be arranged, over that empire on
which the sun never sets and the night never
ceases, and from which the drought and the
plague never wholly lift. The greatest pagan
and Mohammedan state on this earth is to
illuminate, if circumstances admit, in honor
of the sovereign whose greatness rests partly
on the Bible, and largely on the Koran, and
partly on other things too numerous to
desci'ibe. The occasion may not amount to
much, and the cause of rejoicing may seem
somewhat inadequate, but these things can
pass. The mere fact that something is
longer than anything else is not so wholly
remarkable as to call for universal joy ; un-
usual length is a circumstance which Vic-
toria’s reign shares equally with the Amazon,
and the principal boa-constrictor, and the
1886 drought, and Speaker Abbott when he
is lying down, and Jawbone Neild’s great
speech, and Judge Windeyer’s ten-hour
charge to the Mount Rennie jury. Also, it
is a characteristic of the S.A. railway to Ood-
nadatta, and of the equator, and the long
threepenny beer and the time it takes to find
the body of the man who went a-missing with
Butler, and many other things.
* * * *
Nevertheless, the “record anniversary”
of Victoria’s accession is to be a great occa-
sion. The cable reports that all the Premiers
of all the British colonies have been invited
to London “ as the guests of the British
nation,” and other celebrations are in course
of arrangement. There is something gro-
tesque about this garish assemblage disturb-
ing any respectable lady in her declining
years, and interfering with her due allowance
of sleep, and reminding her indirectly of her
extreme old age by allusions to the 60 years
which lie between her and her youth.
There is something unpleasant in the idea of
all these varied politicians gathering together
to rejoice because a person who never did
them any harm has lived so long as to have
little chance of living much longer. Even
the clumsiest politician can hardly tell a lady
that he is glad she is so old, nor can he
decently say he is sorry she didn’t die
younger, so the situation is distinctly awk-
ward. Apart from the gathering of Premiers
there will probably be only a cheap and
second-rate rejoicing—in Australia, at all
events. Loyalty is at a comparatively low
ebb just now. It comes in with the loan-
moneys, and the land-boom, and the price of
wool, and the rise in wheat, and the rains.
And it goes out with the burst, and the
drought, and the depression, and the ticks,
and the bottom falling out of the frozen-
meat market. Loyalty is one of the luxuries
of prosperity, like champagne and mid-
night banquets ; the devotion of the com-
munity to its Queen can be measured
by its devotion to burgundy and Flossies
and cigars; and the dribbling of the rich
Rhine wine over its beard and its diamond
shirt-stud is a fair measure of its devotion to
the Throne and Person ; and the difficulty
it has in getting home to its marble hall
with the milk in the morning is in direct
ratio to its theoretical readiness to die for its
beloved sovereign. Australia is very, very
poor just now, therefore it isn’t loyal to any
extent worth mentioning. The tide went
out long ago, and Fink’s arrangement, and
Reid’s deficit, and the downfall of James
Muniio, and the dead-and-gone banks, and
the Men that are Dead are so many ripples
on the sand to mark its subsidence. The
last great evidence of loyalty in Australia
was the disappearance of the Victorian Par-
liamentary mace, the time some festive legis-
lators humped it to a house of ill-fame, and
left it there in a moment of drunk and dis-
organisation. Loyalty is partly indigestion
—partly gin and apoplexy—-mostly stomach,
and consequently pimples. It is a thing
which people get when they have much com-
fortable leisure, and don’t know what else to
do with it, and may as well spend it in being
loyal as in anything else. The community
which suddenly falls from affluence and has
to hustle hard for an existence isil’t loyal.
* * * *
If the seven Premiers of Australasia all
accept the royal invitation one result is cer-
tain—the politics of ’9B will be vastly different
from those of ’97. Individual Premiers have
gone ’Ome before, and fallen from grace, and
accepted titles and distinctions, and damned
Chicago —but never yet in this country’s his-
tory have seven Premiers fallen all together.
It will be a fearsome sight—the downfall of
seven Premiers all in a row—and yet it
is a perfectly possible event. No Australian
Minister that The Bulletin remembers
has gone to England, and been officially
welcomed, and has associated with the British
peerage, without falling from democracy.
There are many reasons for this, especially
in the case of the purely local politician to
whom Britain is a new world. The vast
population —40,000,000 people compressed
into two little islands—is tremendously im-
pressive after the emptiness of this great,
lonesome continent. The old age of the
country, its traditions, its wealth—the visit-
ing politician of any note never sees Spital-
fields and Hoxton and all the other slums of
all the dismal cities, and to those who only
haunt the wealthy regions of England its
wealth looks overwhelming—all these are
startling compared to the gaunt, bare, new-
ness of this country with its squalid tradi-
tions of the convict-days and of King Billy
and his gin. The masterfulness of J. Bull
strikes the stranger with 40 million Bull-
power. This result arises mainly from force
of numbers-—the masterfulness of 40,000,000
Germans would strike him in like manner if
he went under the same circumstances to
Berlin and Hamburg ; it is merely the result
of numbers, and the rush of countless feet,
and the uncountableness of the innumerable
top-hat, and the unspeakable abundance of
the living and of the tombstones of the dead.
Also, Britain is very fresh and green and
novel, after the dust-clouds that rise out of
the camel-tracks away at the back of Bourke,
and by comparison with the droughty plains,
and the deserts, and the miles and miles of
wire fence, and the evening-paper horror
about the prospector who died of thirst, and
the crow that ate his eyes, and the dingo
that gnawed his bones. These are some of
the more respectable things which bring the
wandering politician back with a deep rever-
ence for British institutions. As his rever-
ence makes Australia no less arid and unin-
viting and empty, and doesn’t alleviate the
crow or the dust-storm, it is a very foolish
sentiment, but it is one that has to be
reckoned with none the less.
* * * *
Further, the Australian politician, in the
main, has the same grovelling regard for
titles as any other man or politician, and an
insight into the place where titles are manu-
factured and distributed is to him an impres-
sive spectacle. In many cases the receipt of
the title per medium of a dry official letter is
sufficient in itself to bring about his down-
fall ; to gain personal access to the divinity
Which turns the handle of the mill that grinds
out noblemen, large and small ,
sized, is still more demoralising to his shaky
Democratic instincts. On this occasion, it .
almost certain, the “honors will be more
than usually large and lavish ; and the po -
tician who might hesitate to fa >} , I , nlls ■
is likely to have less scruples about falling in
company, especially with the glory of being
the guest of the British nation and having Ins
liquor-bill defrayed by the British treasury
to make him even more drunk and irrespon-
sible than he otherwise might be. It the
scheme works reasonably well, Australasia
will want seven new Premiers about this
time next year, and want them worse than it
ever did before. And what will happen m
the interim it is difficult to guess. There are
very few things which Britain could ask that
seven Premiers —all the guests of the Britis 1
nation —with their brand-new titles upon
them, and fresh from shaking hands with the
Royal family and from drinking with the
peerage, would not promise on the spot.
If the corpse of Imperial Federation was just
a shade less dead than it is, even that would
be capable of resuscitation at such a moment.
As it is, it should be a grand time for tighten-
ing those silken bonds which have, of late,
showed such lamentable signs of neglect,
and making serious arrangements about atiord-
ing special tariff concessions to the British
exporter, and giving another boost to the
naval subsidy, and laying plans for making
Greater Britain contribute to the land
defence of the empire, and for rendering the
Australian Federation as distinctly “ Feder-
ation under the Crown ’ as possible. And
in the wake of the seven Premiers—if they
all go—there will go a weird procession of
awful poets and majors and mayors and
Fitz Gibbons and small politicians, who will
make speeches and odes and other things,
and horribly advertise this hapless country,
unless it rises to repudiate them and all their
works.
* * * *
It will be something to be an Australasian
Premier in 1897. Therefore, the men who
just missed the billets — Stout, who reckons
that he lost Seddon’s place by a, hair’s-
breadth ; Frank Stuart, who was in train-
ing for the Yic. Premiership when the
unknown Turner sat down hard and im-
movably in the vacant seat; Byrnes and
Tozer, who saw the colorless, commonplace
Nelson put over their heads after they had
borne the heat and burden of the Boodle-
wraith ; M‘Millan, who let Reid have the
New South Wales Premiership more in irony
than earnest and has cursed him in vain ever
since—all of them will gnash their teeth with
a great gnash. And even if any of these
Premiers are gone before the event comes off
some other people will gnash their teeth over
the new ones just the same. It is a unique
opportunity —one which cannot come again
till about 1959 at the earliest, and by that time
the politicians of to-day will all be dead, or in
their dotage, or in the benevolent asylum, or
toothless and out of politics and remem-
brance, so to all intents and purposes it
might as ivell never come again at all. And
when the seven, or whatever other number
it may be, come back ! ! There are
great possibilities about that coming back.
Some may find their Governments vanished
into thin air—wrecked by an incompetent
or unlucky locum tenens in their absence.
Some will probably find their seats in pro-
cess of being jumped by their understudies.
Some will probably find their businesses or
their investments or their female belongings
“gone wrong” in their absence. All will
probably return burdened with promises
which looked very small when they were
given, and which look very large and awk-
ward when they have to be redeemed and
explained away and clumsily apologised for be-
fore a jeering country. And, worst of all, they
may never go at all. Even the most ardent
loyalist must admit that the life on which
the celebration depends is very old and
frail, and may flicker out at any moment.
On the very eve of the great proceeding
the whole jubilee may fall through, and the
seven men who never went be a subject of
mirth for ever afterwards. And the spectacle
of the Premier who didn’t start, sadly hump-
ing back his portmanteau from the mail-boat
where the dreadful cablegram, stating that
he wasn’t to come, overtook him, would be a
whole essay on the futility of earthly hopes
and expectations.
A Study from the Nude.
Undress the Australian race. Are the men
big-boned, broad-chested, firm-muscled, with
legs like twin towers, and a back that would bear
a bullock ? Are the women shapely, substantial
and exuberant with vitality ? . . . The Bulle-
tin stands at its mind’s window, and watches a
procession of three million individuals without
any clothes on, defiling down George-street
Sydney, to the Circular Quay.
* * * *
A mixed lot—is generalisation possible ? Such
an area so many heights—so many tempera-
tures—such varying humidity: the coast-dweller
and the man of the interior eastern plateau, the
sun-dried Queenslander and the ruddy Tas-
manian, the mother in 15 degrees south latitude
and the mother in 35 degrees— what deductions
can be drawn from conditions and denizens so
dissimilar? None, to cover all Australia and
the future; but there are some which rest
fairly established for the bulk of Australians in
the present.
' • * .
The procession passes interminably. . What
a weedy lot we are breeding in the great cities of
Melbourne and Sydney— pithless, sallow, with
pipestem limbs and narrow shoulders, alternat-
ing between fever and lassitude, ripened pre-
maturely. The coastal climate of S.E. Aus-
tralia is decidedly not an invigorating climate
for most of those who live in it. It strikes at
the root of strength by discouraging abdominal
respiration : the Sydney youth just flutters the
top of his lungs and keeps his chest-cavity con-
tracted. His blood is never sufficiently aerated :
his muscles grow rapidly flaccid, for the
enervating moist warmth indisposes him to
physical exercise. He rarely walks when he
can afford twopence for a seat on a ’bus-top :
wonderfully few of him play cricket in propor-
tion to the thousands who look on. Grown
older, the Sydney man dislikes hard labor,
prefers finger-work to arm-work. He drives
a parcel-van ; but the heavy drays, with
heavy lifts, are driven by imported Britons
and Irish. He is rarely big enough to be a
policeman. A great deal of shipping comes
into his port, but he finds a sailor’s life too full
of hardship. Sometimes he goes w harf-lumping,
but it is to carry nice light tea-chests for Gibbs,
Bright and Co., not heavy sacks of Maoriland
potatoes for John See. Work is very severe
in the gas-works : there are no Australians
there ; but you will find plenty in the printing-
offices and tobacco-factories. And it is much
the same in Melbourne.
* * * *
And the city girls and women ? Look at
them : plump at 15; “ going off” at 20; at 30
yellow and cadaverous in maidenhood, or cada-
verous and yellow in marriage; at 40 dowdy
and draggletailed, with an eternal tale of their
diseases. There are many exceptions, but that
is the prevailing impression one gathers from
the crowd of naked femininity passing before
The Bulletin’s mental window.
* * * »
And in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney,
exposed to the urban influences alvrays disas-
trous to physique, reside 24 per cent, of the
whole Australian population. The Govern-
ments of Victoria and N.S. Wales do their
best to keep them there by centralising the
civil service far more than is necessary; by bor-
rowing large sums of money of which the
metropolis gets a disproportionate share ; by
failing to encourage interior settlement, and
succeeding in encouraging people to loaf and
be fed on the coast; and by helping to make a
country life as dreary and uninviting as a city
life is pleasant and easy. Like many of their
people, the S.E. Governments want bracing up.
* • »
The procession passes with its clothes under
its arm. . . . Decidedly the countrymen and
country women are better-looking: their food
often wants variety, but they generally get
plenty of fresh air and exercise. The men
and women from the western selections
and squattages of N.S. Wales and Queens-
land are generically lean, lank, and tough:
in the South they are often as lank and
tough, hardly so lean. Many good specimens
of manly and womanly beauty lurk in favored
districts. The small lot of Westralians pre-
sents no identifiable characteristics. From the
w'hole survey one main fact seems established:
physiological reasons elsewhere urged against
the aggregation of population in cities have
more force, instead of less, in Australia. And
the economic reasons hold good too.
* * * *
A convention is soon to meet for the purpose
of making an Australian nation. But an Aus-
tralian nation is not to be made by any draft of
laws or set of principles. It can only be made
by strong fathers, sound mothers, healthy en-
vironment. “ Jinyus ! jinyus ! ” says Charles
Reade, “ take care o’ your carkus!” Australia
has plenty of genius, but its carcase leaves
much to be desired. That will never reach the
ideal, cr anywhere near it, until the city popu-
lation is driven forth to draw, like Antaeus,
new life from contact with the vital earth.
* * * *
The Bulletin will never be easy in its mind
until convinced that, man for man, the Austra-
lian race is physically as good as the best race
bred from human loins. This country is
rich and very thinly populated, and there are
several warlike nations who may cast a covetous
eye upon it when circumstances draw their
attention this way. The chances are that some
day Australia will have to choose whether it
will become the dependency of a foreign despot
or will fight that despot’s armies as long as it
owns a man to carry a rifle. Presuming that it
will fight, The Bulletin wants to know how it
will fight? Australians have plenty of pluck,
but pluck is not the only requisite in a soldier.
He wants good leers to walk fast and far; a
good stomach to digest hoofs, hides, and what-
ever may come unhandy when the commissariat
breaks down ; wind, and endurance, and the
power to match hand-to-hand any man that
may come against him. The Bulletin would
like to think the average Australian, especially
the average city Australian, has these requisites
of a good fighter, but, looking at the naked pro-
cession passing its mind’s window, it has con-
siderable doubts in the matter.
* * * *
So, putting two and two together, The Bul-
letin suggests that one of the first duties of
the Australian Federal Government will be
to compulsorily enrol every able-bodied male
to serve in a citizen army,- giving him a rifle
and ammunition, but no pay, and making him
drill at least three hours a w'eek for three years,
and intermittently after that so as to keep up
his training. The effect on the physique of the
race would be good and prodigious ; think what
regular drill would do for Premier Reid, from
whom this paper had to turn its head away as
he went past just now with his clothes in a
bundle. And the capacity of Australia to de-
fend herself from foreign invasion would
increase enormously. . . . The procession is dis-
missed : the Australian race can put its clothes
on.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Railway Myth.
R. E. O’Connor, M.L.C. (N.S.W.), whose legal
training and reputedly vast intellect should
qualify him for better things, throws in his lot,
in a mild sort of way, with the provincialists,
and announces himself as a Federal candidate
with the same limitations as most of the rest.
About three-fourths of the N,S.W. Federal


candidates stop short at the point where
O’Connor’s federalism breaks down ; they are
willing to federate almost everything except the
railways, but they draw the line there because
the N.S. W. railways pay better at the present
moment than those of any other province
except Westralia, and they assume that this
has always been the case—which it hasn’t ; and
that it is always going to be the case—which is
quite unlikely ; and that it is the natural order
of things—about which there is no evidence.
R. E. O’Connor, on this point, raises the same
stereotj’ped argument as all the rest:
The New South Wales railway system at present was a
paying concern, and It was in a very complete state. The
loss, if any, only amounted to a very small fraction. The
loss on the Victorian railways was 1.13 per cent., whilst
in Queensland the railways showed a loss of 1.23 per cent.
That on the South Australian railways was something like
3 per cent. Our railways were not only the best-paying
and best-managed railways in Australia, but, having got
through all this dead-way, as it were, must rapidly begin
to pay better in the future. The people of the colony
were now asked to pool their railways—to throw in their
paying concern —with others that were run at a loss.
The New South Wales lines are not, by a very
long way, a paying concern—they have only a
smaller deficit than those of some other pro-
vinces ; also, they are not “ the best-paying
railways in Australia ” by a big margin ; and
the South Australian deficit isn’t “ something
like 3 per cent.” but a good deal less than l
per cent. ; and the country expected something
better than this awful ignorance from a man of
R. E. O’Connor’s standing. Still, these are
mere details. The matter really at issue
is the stupid unfairness of New South
Wales politicians generally in their con-
stant harping on the railway question to the
exclusion of all others. R. E. O’Connor is
quite willing to amalgamate the Postal de-
partments and say nothing about it, though the
N.S. W. Post Office shows a deficit on working
expenses alone of <£70,000, while Victoria has a
profit of over £4OOO and S.A. of nearly
£50,000. Also there is a general willingness,
even among many people who take up R. E.
O’Connor’s attitude on railway matters, to
throw the public debts into a common heap,
and to say nothing about the fact that N.S. W.
has nine millions of debt which is represented
by no revenue-producing assets, against \ ic-
toria’s 2§ millions or rather less. The tele-
graphs are likewise, by unanimous consent, to
go into the common stock, and no reference is
ever made to the fact that the telegraphs in
N.S. W. have, in addition to the loss on work-
ing expenses, to pay interest on £866,000 of
borrowed money, while those of Victoria have
no such burden, and it is proposed to lump them
all together regardless of the mother province’s
£30,000 annual deficit for interest alone. The
great O’Connor idea, in fact, is that N.S.W.
should throw into the common interest all its
losing speculations, and keep its one reasonably
. profitable investment, the railways, under pro-
vincial management. And it is this sort of
policy which makes N.S.W. the aggressive J.
Bull of this continent and the chief obstacle
to Federation.
Jolly and Fat.
Tub first complete year of the great Foreign-
trade “ Jollv and Fat ” policy in N.S.W. ended
on 31st Dec., and the returns are beginning to
come in. Almost the first one is the melan-
choly wail of Sydney Benevolent Asylum
authorities who announce that 1896 was the
worst year in their experience, and the very
first line in the statement is a story of how
N.S.W. isn’t jolly and shows no signs of fat
whatever :
The report of the society’s operations for the year 1896
is of greater importance than that of any previous annual
record. The work in the interests of the distressed poor
has been of larger extent and of more varied character
than that accomplished during the history of the institu-
tion—now extending over 76 years
As the experience of the institution dates back
beyond the lifetime of most people now living
it probably speaks with authority on this
matter. Parson Boyce, who seconded the
adoption of the report, lent additional weight
to it by stating that “ he had never known a
year so bad as 1896.” The figures and facts
given certainly bear out these assertions. In
the outdoor relief department the average of
cases where assistance was given started in
January with 820 per week. Then it steadily
climbed upwards till in December the weekly
average was 1256. These were not per-
sons, but families ; the number of individual
destitutes receiving relief on January 1 was
2856, while on the 31st December they num-
bered 4337. This work represented the regular
business of the institution, but, in addition, it
ran for ten months a special unemployed relief
department, which began with 102 cases per
week in February and ended with 575 per
week in November. Then this department was
taken over by the State Labor Bureau, and its
doings are now judiciously buried out of sight,
but the record while it lasted was sufficiently
disastrous. These depressing figures deal with
outdoor-relief only ; they take no account of
destitutes received into the society’s institu-
tions. Also, they take no account of the fact that
the Benevolent Asylum is only one of 27 organ-
ised charitable institutions in Sydney alone.
The figures show, not only that 1896 was the
poorest, hungriest, and most miserable year
known in Sydney for a generation or two,
but that it went from bad to worse, and
ended in a much more lamentable state
than it began. And the society’s results
were arrived at despite the great efforts
of the Government to meet the increasing
distress by relief-works, mostly paid for
with borrowed money, and despite a
large exodus of population. In 1896,
for the first time in all the years covered by the
State statistics, the departures from N.S.W.
exceeded the arrivals, the loss being 842 against
a gain of 2559 in 1895, and 4299 in ’94. There-
fore it seems that, whereas up to the beginning
of the first year of Reid’s great Foreign-trade
policy N.S.W. was so much less distressful
than its troubled neighbors that population
continued to come in from adjacent lands, in
1896 it grew to be so much worse than its
neighbors that it became a remarkably good
place to get away from. The loss was not on
the oversea trade, but through a steady exodus
to the three adjacent protected provinces—Vic-
toria, S.A., and Queensland. These, however,
are only scraps of information ; the bulk of the
1896 records won’t be available till the State
statistics are issued, a good many months
hence. But, so far as they go, they show
that nothing very good has happened to N.S. W.
under its new Foreign-trade regime, and that
the alleged inrush of population from the adja-
cent provinces to get into the Promised Land
of Shoddy and away from the curse of Protec-
tion is a blatant lie ; and that the policy which
was to abolish the unemployed has rather in-
creased them ; and that the good time which
was coming hasn’t come, and that G. Reid is
only dust and ashes and imposture.
“ Lex ” to The Bulletin :
The late railway accident at Sydney station is an exam-
ple of only some of the risks run by railway passengers
under the present regime. Fortunately, no one was
seriously injured, and the latest swindle worked on the
N.S.W. travelling public lies hidden in the statute-book.
How many people in the province are aware that, under
no circumstances, can damages greater than the paltry
sum of £2OOO be recovered from the Railway Commis-
sioners for any injury sustained on the railway ? Yet such
is the fact. In Oct. last year the Commissioners, aided
by the indifference of Parliament, obtained the most
scandalous Act ever passed in the province. Sec. 2 of 60
Vic., No. 21, enacts that “ No larger sum than two thou-
sand pounds shall be recoverable in any action, either under
the Act 11th, Victoria No. 32 (this is Campbell’s Act,
which provides for compensating the families of persons
killed by accident), or otherwise, against the Railway
Commissioners of N.S. Wales, as carriers of passengers,
in respect of injuries sustained after the passing of this
Act, by any person while being carried upon any railway
or tramway vested in the Commissioners, or while being
in, upon, or about any station, yard, land or premises
vested in or used by the Commissioners.” The Commis-
sioners may now kill or maim anybody at a cost of £2OOO
—a sum insufficient to provide for the family of any
worker in the community. Two thousand pounds at 4
per cent, (which interest cannot now be realised on abso-
lutely safe security) will only return 180, and this is what
N.S.W. Parliament in its wisdom and with its high ideals
of justice considers sufficient compensation for a family
robbed of its bread-winner. A reference to Hansard will
show that the Bill, as presented to Parliament, contained a
provision making it compulsory on the Commissioners to
insure passengers at a small rale ; but some wiseacre ob-
jected to it, and it was sacrificed. A noticeable feature
about this Act is the silence concerning it and its pro-
visions which was maintained by the “free” press of
Sydney. As far as the writer can remember not one word
was said or written against it. The Act has come to stay,
and will be law for many a year ; for the most difficult
thing to get any Parliament to do is to repeal an unjust
Act which finds favor amongst “ persons with influence.”
[lt would probably surprise “Lex” to learn
that there are some very good reasons why the
sufferers by a State railway accident which
happens in defiance of reasonable precautions
should not be compensated at all ; there are
many why a limit should be set to the eccen-
tricities of jurymen dealing with the public
funds. The Commissioners have nothing to do
with the payment ; it is the community that
pays. The railway traveller can insure his
life just as a steamboat traveller has to do.
When the community explicitly announces that
it will be responsible for £2OOO and no more,
the conditions of the contract between itself
and its individuals are perfectly fair and above-
board ; and if any individual doesn’t like the
conditions he need not travel on the railways.

Cardinal Moran announces himself definitely
as a Federal Convention candidate for N.S.W.,
and the yellow pup of sectarianism may be ex-
pected to howl shortly, and the Holy Roman
and the bitter Orangeman to reach for each
other’s hair in the sacred cause of unity. Mr.
Moran’s interference will probably add all the
cussedness of religious prejudice to a question
which was sufficiently tangled up without any
such addition; and, judging by his published
sentiments, he promises to be a weak and miser-
ably incapable Federationst as well as a cause
of strife. The Cardinal suggests —not forcibly,
as one having authority, but feebly like a
bruised reed leaning up against the wall—that
the railway systems may possibly be kept
separate for 12 or 18 years, and that each pro-
vince may perhaps run its own separate fiscal
system for the same period or thereabouts—in
other words, that the border tariffs and the
five or six or seven separate fiscal pro-
blems should rage along just as usual,
and the differential railway rates should do
likewise, and the break of gauge become a
bigger question every day, and there should be
unity without anything being united. Cardinal
Moran may be fairly set down as almost the
most hopeless candidate on the job up to date.
A man who vaguely believes in a Federal
railway system, yet suggests postponing unifi-
cation for 18 years, and who proposes an alleged
Federation with half-a-dozen different fiscal
policies raging furiously in its midst, is a unique
combination of how to do it as badly as possible
and how not to do it at all Also, his Emi-
nence doesn’t suggest how the Federal re-
venue is to be raised if the Federal Govern-
ment is to have no control over Customs re-
venue ; he seems to have no opinion at all
about the Federal Constitution or the public
debt —in fact, his whole policy, so far as it is
announced, consists of the proposal that Sydney
shall be the capital and the suggestion that the
most urgent matters shall be postponed for 18
years or so, and the rest is dead silence and
platitudes. Cardinal Moran is unique as being
the one candidate up to date, barring Joseeii
Abbott, who offers nothing at all —except his
blessing and the inevitable sectarian row that
comes behind him, and who is all negation and
apostolic gorgeousness. And between Abbott,
who relies for public support on the fact that he
is long, and Moran, who does the same because
he is bright-red, the Federal business is getting
into pretty deep water. The Moran Federal
policy is—“ Ah, it’ll all come right, plaze God.”
The old Federal Council, which has just held
its seventh meeting in the eleventh year of its
precarious existence, looks even less real than
usual this time. In its early stages the F.C.
professed to have some belief in itself. It met
once a year, and talked about things with a
certain amount of energy. Now it meets every
two years—-it would probably do it at much
longer intervals only a clause in its constitution
sets forth that if it lets two years pass without
being officially heard of it shall be presumed to
be dead and shall meet no more. So in the
last days of the last year of grace the Federal
Council crawls together to inspect itself and
see that it is still living, and holds a meeting or
two about nothing in particular, and thereby
provides for keeping itself nominally alive
for another two years, in case it should
want itself —which is possible, but not likely.
The fact that the Federal Council now only
gets together at the very last moment to save
itself from extinction is a sufficient evidence
that all public interest has gone out of the
business. The recent suggestions of Queens-
land Attorney-General Byrnes for putting fresh
life in the dry bones hardly attracted the
notice of anybody. Nobody could revivify
these bones, and nobody wants to, and hardly
anybody is even aware now that there are any
bones, or that there ever were any, and nobody
cares much whether there are any bones or not.
“ Died through being a dry thing talking itself
to death about nothing in the wilderness ”
would be a respectable epitaph for the late
Federal Council.
Writes “ Marie Blaas ” :
“ Let the city consume its own smoke ! ” This par-
ticularly applies to the social wreckage produced by the
economic system of society, which creates and then
punishes its victims for being what they are. For a
number of years now N.S.W. authorities have found it
convenient to play battledore and shuttlecock with the
unemployed. They first deny the existence of this body,
and then give themselves the lie direct by establishing
and carrying on a Labor Bureau to provide them
with laborious work at sweaters’ wages, and call it
charity. Some thousands of the workless have been
given free passes and then shunted into the
bush—to beg, thieve, starve, or die under a gum-tree.
The bush towns have been burdened for years to support
a floating population mostly from the city. Butchers,
bakers, and storekeepers are all bummed to death to
supply great numbers of men with the necessaries of life.
The undesirable element —gaol-birds, deadbeats, and
sneak-thieves —is pretty numerous. No camp or tent is
safe from their depredations. To return from a long and
hard day’s work to And tucker and clothes missing is a
common experience. This can be fully appreciated when
the nearest township is often 20 to 40 miles distant. For
the State to shirk its duties and responsibilities and to shift
its own load on to the shoulders of the bush towns is the
essence of injustice. Most of the squatters have ceased to
give rations, knowing that they can get men from Sydney
without going to the expense of keeping travellers.
Three-fourths of the men employed in sheds are cockies’
sons, who take up land with the ostensible object of
making a living out of it, but, instead of cultivating it,
compete in the labor-market with the nomadic worker.
In fact, the swagman has outlived his usefulness and is
no longer required, being an eyesore who is despised and
looked down upon with contempt. “ Let the city con-
sume its own smoke.”
The action of the N.S.W. Labor politicians in
putting forth a party ticket and nominating ten
party candidates for the Convention looks like a
ghastly mistake. Assuming that the ten get in
—and it is presumable that the party wants to
get them in or it wouldn’t have nominated them
—they are responsible to each other and to
their party for each item of their programme.
There seems to be no room for modification or
concession ; it is their whole programme or
nothing, and the party which demands all or
nothing generally gets nothing—also, it often
prevents other people getting anything. The
Labor ticket demands that there shall be an
ideal Democratic Commonwealth from the very
beginning, or else no Commonwealth at all.
Australia must either get the perfect article
all at once or never get anything. If this
country could construct a Central Government
which was just a little better than the
average of the Provincial Governments,
and which had reasonable possibilities
of improvement, then it would have gained
sometliing, but the Labor-party isn’t taking
that view. It demands that the people who
can’t make a perfect local Constitution should
make a perfect Federal one, or go without.
If there was any promise of ever getting a per-
fect Provincial Government, then there would
be some reason in rejecting the Federal
Government for not being perfect, but there is
no such prospect. F'urther, there is no pro-
spect that the rejection just now of a partially
imperfect Federal system will bring a perfect
one any nearer. As matters stand, the
spectacle of a party going to discuss a great
national question, and announcing in ad-
vance that there is no room for discussion —
that its programme is cut and dried, and
must be accepted whole, or it will, as
far as possible, shut down on the entire
business, also creates antagonism. If every
individual member of the Labor-party had come
forward as a candidate on his own principles
and his own responsibility, it would have mat-
tered nothing. But the party programme and
the 10 party nominees looks like woefully bad
generalship. The Labor-party puts forward a
remarkably good and clear and liberal policy,
but when it announces that it will surrender
nothing—that it “ insists ” on everything, even
the name to be given to the new combination—
its principles are a great deal better than its
generalship.
The American struggle to popularise religion
and keep the fat parson’s table well supplied
with buckwheat cakes and m’lasses is yearly
growing harder. The most orthodox of wor-
shippers now take their lectures on current
topics mixed with arias by operatic stars. And
the less orthodox well, how their five-cent
bits are gathered in is told by Rev. W. B.
Hale in Dec. Forum. The American church is
rapidly being turned into a circus. To raise
cash last year, for example
St. John’s Methodist Episcopal Church, Toledo, gave a
stimulating entertainment by the Peak Sisters, intro-
ducing that touching- ballad, “ Do You Know the Mouth
of Man ?” in which the gentle art of kissing is referred to
90 times.
At Fredonia, New York, the Sacred Female Minstrels
only corked and wore bloomers ; but at Woodside, Long
Island, one of the holy band kicked a tambourine held
above her head -all for the love of (lon, and dollars.
In the Trilby Social given by the Suffren Methodist
Episcopal Epworth League and the New Brunswick Pro-
testant Episcopal Olive Branch Society, the young ladies
of the church displayed their legs behind a curtain lifted
to a height described as “ tantalising.”
Few cities or towns have this year been without a
Bicycle Service. Floral wheels make appropriate decora-
tions, and if the organ has a Swiss Bell stop it may be
appropriately played. A favorite text is Psalm lxxxiii.,
13, “ O my God, make them like a wheel.” (Hebrew
galjjal, a whirling thing).
The pastor of the Methodist Church of St. Louis,
Michigan, having entertained firemen, veterans, and
blacksmiths, outdid himself in a Barbers’ Sunday Even-
ing. Scissors, hair-dye, cups, soaps, brushes and combs,
mirrors and washes, tastefully arranged on the walls and
platform, with festoons of towels and rosettes of brillian-
tine and bay-rum bottles, gave a homelike appearance to
the church ; sitting in a barber’s chair the pastor gathered
inspiration for his lecture, and then, rising, he pressed
home in the choicest terms of the tonsorial profession the
lesson of the razor and the strop.
At Otsego, Michigan, the pastor gave Bdols. every night
for a week to decipherers of his text, printed on the bill
like this : —“ Text for Friday evening : Eodht anrfo ehfte
litbso enout awsol belet eosfo dgons hdlse duhct hsupd
wteha rhaet vloen mawlh.”
And so on ad infinitum. A few remarks are
obviously needed just here, and The Bulletin
cordially invites the spirit of John Knox to
step forward.
♦
Coercion Byrnes’ Federal Council proposal
that the Council be made elective was only
upset by the casting vote of the President
given in accordance with the Standing Orders.
It was a cunning device calculated to take the
wind out of the Federation sails, and was so
skilfully handled that it would have been
carried by a big majority but for the fact that
most of the Federal Councillors expect to be
Convention delegates, and were afraid of mini-
mising their chances of election by supporting
the proposal. Queensland evidently desires to
wreck the ship it refuses to sail in because it
doesn’t carry a black crew.

A difficulty in surgical operations aided

show how deeply an intruding object is embedded.
W. D. Filmer, an electrical engineer in N.S.W.

angles and combining them in a stereoscope, which
brings out the perspective admirably.

pictorial study by Falk —in which an eye blurred
against the background is a flaw. A. J. Relph,
of Melb., has found a fine old bullock-driving sub-
ject, but a mistake was made in keeping the
bullocks so close that they are merged in the main
figure. The literary matter is of fair interest.
The Electric Photo.-Eng. Co. and Batson and Co.

Frank Thornton and the “Strange Adven-
tures of Miss Brown ” filled Sydney Gri. to over-
flowing on Saturday. “ Brown ” —the full title is
too long for ordinary, everyday use—is in three
acts, of which the first is rather slow and introduc-
tory, while the other two are fast and furious and
complicated. The plot can be written on the
back of a postage stamp, if the stamp is large
enough. A giddy captain abducts a girl-ward in
chancery from Cicero House Academy, and the
natural consequence is that, half-an-hour after
their marriage, the police recapture the bride and
take her back to school, and the bridegroom flies,
disguised in woman’s clothes, from the fury of the
Lord Chancellor who is after him with a warrant.
Then, in his lone despair, he decides to recover
his wife or burst his corset in the attempt, and
his accomplice, the Major, leaves him at the
academy as an orphaned female of deficient
education, and promises to send a cheque for her
first quarter’s schooling. The cheque never comes,
neither do Miss Brown’s other clothes, but that
is a mere item. The second act leads up to the
elopement; the third shows a sullen, dishevelled,
fighting Brown back in handcuffs at the ladies’
academy, with her skirt torn and her hair any-
how, and sulking muddily in a corner under the
severe disapprobation of everybody. The bride
got off in the carriage that was in waiting, but her
Brown stayed behind to fight out a chance encoun-
ter with a policeman and a German music-master
and to cover the retreat. In the conflict the long-
haired German is bashed out of all semblance of
respectability, and the policeman and Miss Brown
have about eleven tooth-and-claw fights in as
many separate ditches, and run several miles
across country. But two more policemen arrive
and overwhelm the orphan girl; and but for the
sudden death of a rich relative which raises her to
the peerage, and mollifies the Chancellor, there is
no knowing what might happen to her.
Some things in “ Brown ” are not quite so
new as they might be. The story of the captain’s
great joke in India is lifted bodily from Kipling,
and the brown schoolgirl from Demarara is collared
bodily from Thackeray. Also, there is a suspicion
that a good deal more fun might be made out of
Miss Brown’s embarrassment while she is still
trying to be a modest girl-captain at Cicero House.
Still, “Brown ” is a hilarious joke, and should do
well. Thornton’s girl is a luridly amusing
character, and her struggles with her skirt and
her umbrella, and the impossibility of finding
her pocket, and her tendency to take off her
hair and wave it in salutation, and her weak
yielding to the cuddlesome tendencies of the
sentimental brown girl from Demarara are
well worked out. The brown girl, played by
Miss Bessie Rignold, is a lady who calls for
much commendation. When The Bulletin last
saw her, Bessie Rignold was nothing in particu-
lar ; now she is a very clever actress of great
promise. Miss Meta Pelham, Fred Shepherd as
the designing Major, and Miss Honey Seabrooke,
are all good, though the latter isn’t an overwhelm-
ing success all the time, and Herbert Terry’s
German is a fine, soulful, eccentric Herr of the
deepest dye. Guyton Heath’s detective is the
weakest feature of the co. ; he isn’t much of a
detective to begin with, and when he has finished
his eighteenth round in the ditch with Miss
Brown he looks a torn agricultural person with an
everyday air of turnips. Still the detective is
only a circumstance, and as the schoolmistress
may be fairly balanced against him, things are
about even, and no one can complain much.
Besides, the outbreak of Cicero House in its snowy
night-dress, and with its hair hanging down its
back, is sufficient to compensate for many dozen
policemen.
** * *
That good old hunk of woe, the “Lights
of London,” helps to fill in the latter end of the
Rignold season at the Sydney Royal, and does it
with as much success as could be reasonably ex-
pected. This paper doesn’t pretend to any
great affection for the “ Lights ” or any other
drama of its kind, but in its own bulky way that
piece fills a place which probably wanted filling.
It is distinctively the pig’s-trotter drama—the
play of the costermonger, and the pie man, and
the baked-potato can-man, and the hokey-pokey
man, and of the person with the consumptive
cough under the bridge. The story is given to
long stoppages, in the course of which a London
street scene is turned on, with a struggling mass of
’Arry and his donah, and the ha’penny ice-cream
man barracks irreverently at the hot-spud man,
and the bloater man pokes borak at the saveloy
man, and ’Liza, coming out of the gin-shop with
threepenn’orth in a bottle, foregathers with Sal,
and Bill gives back-talk to the policeman, and
there are many blokes and ooves, and finally some-
one hooks a wipe amid great confusion. Also, Jim
is frequently seen buying some sandwiches for his
gal, and an old woman lifts up a cracked voice
from underneath a poke bonnet and wants some
dog’s-nose on tick. These things have no direct
bearing on the story, but the bloater and the bloke
and all the rest are supposed to lend it local color
and human interest. The “Lights of London”
has got the bloater and the bloke and the pig’s-
feet very badly indeed.
* * * *
George Rignold does his old character of
the slim young hero in very much his old way,
and there is nothing especially good to be said
about that person, except where he makes his
great dive into the tank. Plimmer, Sweeney,
Miss Emily Hughes, and Miss Ada Guildford
also do good work, and manager Marcus lifts
up a very tuneful voice in song. But nobody
gets much of a show in Sims’s huge drama, partly
because of the forty or fifty other people who get
into their road, and partly because they are much
interrupted by the pig’s-feet and the baked-’tater
man, and partly because they are overwhelmed
and snowed under by the tank. The tank-scene,
which is a very beautiful and elaborate affair, is
still the crowning glory of the show, and when
George Rignold casts his 2cwt. of solid hero into
it head first, the gallery feels that it hasn’t lived in
vain. The Rignold season ends at the close of next
week, when the management gathers the tank
under its arm and departs for an extended tour in
other parts.
* * * *
The “ Silver King,” concerning which this
paper said some kind things last week out of the
depths of a full heart, is still living up to the
character then bestowed upon it, and Her
Majesty’s is prospering greatly. Judging by
present prospects, Scot Inglis will return loaded
with wealth from far Nevada and Roberts will
struggle to wrest a shilling from Bodger every
night for a long time to come. The present
writer’s private opinion is that the average audi-
ence doesn’t sufficiently appreciate the importance
of Bodger, and that that invisible and grumpy
baker-man has never received his full meed of
praise. The Denver family is at the very lowest
ebb of its fortunes on the day when the lost
father returns, and but for the shilling contributed
by Bodger to tide over the last few hours death
might overtake them before the Silver King turns
up, and then the story would be wrecked utterly.
The horny and probably unclean hand of Bodger,
coming with a shilling in it out of the infinite, as
it were, stays the calamity. If the hand of Bodger
didn’t drop that solitary bob into the story there
might, to all intents and purposes, be no story at
all. Therefore The Bulletin gives three cheers,
in the spirit, for Bodger, whose importance has
just occurred to it, and trusts that he will be better
appreciated in the future.

The twenty-third instalment of Harry
Rickards' new imported artists is now due. Part
of the instalment, in the shape of Alice Conway
and Edward Clarke, is to open at Sydney Tivoii
on Saturday, and some more instalment, whose
name is Miss Jessie de Gray, appears on Monday
at the Palace. Some remarks about both these
instalments will be made in next issue. Mean-
while both the Tivoli and the Palace are prosper-
ing exceedingly, though there is such a hurried
shifting of characters from one house to the other
that it is difficult to remember where anybody
are, so to speak. To-day (Thursday) Henry Lee
has a matinee of his own at the Palace, when a
large number of artists from all the Sydney
theatres conspire to give him a benefit.
* * * *
The usual large quantity of Cinemato-
graphe was still filling a great public want when
this paper went to press, and new pictures are
being constantly added. Jimmy MacMahon’s
latest triumph is a picture of the lakelet at Wind-
sor Castle, with the swans swimming on the
placid surface and an interfering person chasing a
crowd of long-legged birds on the shore. There is
no collusion about this picture ; the birds aren’t
stiffened in any way, and it is a very pretty piece
of nature. The Lumiere “ Cin.” has a new
speciality in the shape of a high-diving exhibition.
And neither of the two has a picture of the arrest
of Butler, which is a lamentable omission and one
to be deeply regretted.
* * * *
“ A Woman of No Importance ” got a pro-
mising start at Melb. Bijou, insofar that a mixed
audience listening with close attention to Oscar
Wilde’s dialogue forgot to notice that it had very
little bearing on the plot. But that matters little.
Wilde’s play reminds one of a “ Roman candle ”
firework, which discharges a steady shower of
sparks and an occasional colored ball, the ascent
of each ball being heralded by a gentle pop. There
are three mild explosions in this story. A wicked
lord discovers himself to be the illegitimate father
of his private secretary ; the secretary’s mother
informs her son of his relationship to the wicked
lord ; thirdly, that unhappy lady flicks a glove in
her son’s father’s face, as a hint for him to quit
the premises. The rest of the entertainment is
decorative talk—bright, ingenious, obviously
forced, and quite impossible in any sassiety circle,
but fascinating, nevertheless. Also, it is spoken
under real human conditions.
» • * *
The gilt-edged people who give vent to
O. Wilde’s false philosophies, contorted truths, or
sincere epigrams are required to be reposeful the
while, after the manner of their kind. In the
most natural, so called, of comedy dialogue scenes
the characters interchange places every tvvo or
three minutes, like a fielding cricket-team. It is
an absurd rule, yet it is indispensable to the suc-
cess of ordinary dramatic work. Here the talkers
stick to their seats; therefore, considering that
the conversation is extraneous to the plot, its
literary smartness is emphasised by the author s
audacity in putting it to the severest test. A
Woman of No Importance ” contains many sav-
ings that sound very clever (although they don t
bear examination when printed), and a few bril-
liantly unpopular truths. ‘'Children begin by
loving their parents ; then they judge them ; they
seldom or never forgive them,” is a case in point.
Surely, if the virtue of a new moral reflection is
visited upon the father, O. Wilde may hope to be
forgiven a good many sins when settling day
arrives.
* * * *
The three right-thinking characters in
this bizarre play—the wronged mother, her duti-
ful son, and his American sweetheart—are the
least satisfactory as works of art. The mother
expresses foolish melodramatic sentiments concern-
ing her “ shame,” the son has false notions about
bonds of matrimony, and the girl is a pious libel
on American heiresses in general. They combine
with the wicked lord in running the thin plot of
Oscar’s play, and the noble reprobate is the only
convincing item in the trouble. Titheradge, ele-
gantly made up for the occasion, gives a fine per-
formance of his lordship, whilst Mrs. Brough, as
the mother in black, appeals for more sympathy
than she can get out of her exaggerated suffer-
ings. Miss Emma Temple is not at home in the
unthankful position of a priggish ingenue,
and first Melb. impressions of Mr. Edward Ferris,
who has a very difficult part to fill, suggest that
he is a rather heavy young imitator of Forbes
Robertson. The four ladies who carry on the
bulk of the irrelevant conversation are a well-
distributed success. Miss Florence Seymour (the
ope who likens her husband to a promissory note,
because she finds it an awful effort to meet him)
is a much-improved actress since the days of
“ Jim the Penman ”at the old Bijou. Then she
used to worry the present writer by shaking her
head, but now she could carry a cup of tea upon
her handsome box of intellect without spilling a
drop.

“ Matsa ” is dying hard at Melbourne
Princess’s. The gaudy run of that expensive
panto-ganza terminates on Friday, and the last
chances to sniff the peculiar odor of Leoni Clarke’s
animal kingdom will be eagerly snapped up. The
Lucifers are the latest additions to “ Matsa.”
■* * * ♦
On Saturday (13th) “ The Prisoner of
Zenda ” will introduce the Firm’s new eo., to-
gether with a fine collection of new dresses, to
Melbourne notice. The Bulletin has already
mentioned that the “Zenda” production is to be
graced by a choice assortment of local beauty in
the background, and a full report of this unusual
proceeding will appear next week. Meanwhile,
George Gordon is putting the final touches to some
massive scenery. Also, everybody concerned is
in active rehearsal.
** * *
Bland Holt intends to get even with the
opposition by bringing forth “ The Derby
Winner ”on Saturday. Bland’s current show
has been an enormous success, mainly on account
of its horse spectacle, consequently he reckons
that a second edition of horse, issued under an
attractive turfy title, will suit Melbourne better
than any other drama on his list. And, judging
from “ The Derby Winner’s ” triumphant career
in Sydney last winter, the Royal management
will bring off another coup with that sensational
quadruped.

Harry Rickards was to make his farewell
appearance at Melb. Opera House last night
(Wednesday) prior to sailing for Europe and
America in quest of Unique Novelties. The only
Henry leaves a strong programme behind him, and
the business promises to sustain its usual flourish
during its absence. All the same, The Bulletin
hopes he will keep his absence within reasonable
limits and return like a giant refreshed.
At Poverty Point.
Southern sassiety has been suddenly seized with an un-
controllable desire to display its legs in tights—probably
to prove to incredulous mankind that it possesses as
tangible an article as the coryphee who makes the game a
profession. Anyhow, the most photographed of all'Melb.’s
alleged beauties, who cannot be as thin as she looks, pur-
poses airing her lower limbs in the chorus of a certain
opera co., when it re-opens.
Journalist: “What a miserable phase of our business
is sitrnalised by this concurrent rush of the telegram-
mongers into the assumption that Mrs. Charnngton must
be Miss Achurch ! A little knowledge is a fiangerous
thing, etc. Here are the promoted reporters making a
dig at their old line of ‘Another Actress in Trouble
when the woman who sweeps the stage comes before the
police court for boozing. What would be the value of a
journalist if he didn’t know that Mrs. Charnngton must
be Miss Achurch ?”
A man in London, who called at the bloated Hotel Cecil
to see Jimmy MacMahon (the Mighty Atom), had much
trouble in finding him—there were so many colonels, am-
bassadors, and such staying there, named MacMahon. At
last, the caller was leaving in despair when a small page-
boy nudged a be-buttoned comrade—“ You know him,
’Arry ;Vs the gent as Maggie says is a puffeck gentleman
—a little cove, clean-shaved, with a high-glass 1m that s
always in a ’ell of a ’urry and never gets nothin done.
Ernest Fitts, the Melbourne baritone-dentist, who
lately accepted an engagement with the Firm, isa solemn
warning to stage-struck amateurs. In " Matsa he was
required to shave off his moustache and warble drearily
from amidst an awfully unbecoming robe, and his former
lady patients have ceased to talk about him. I itts mo.
was all-in-all to his appearance—as necessary as a black
bell-topper to a city-man’s respectability. And now, to
complete his discomfiture, the unlucky aspirant is down
with typhoid fever.
Young Terrv protests against a Bulletin assertion that
he plays the ‘German music-master, in “ Adventures of
Miss Brown,” with a variable accent, and, by way of
proving that his accent must be consistent, he mentions
that he speaks German fluently. All the same, Terr} s
accent under notice is Franco-German-Savoyardian. At
times he talks exactly like our late friend, Gecko.
Ethel liaydon gets mild reproof from some of the
London theatrical napers for not playing her part in
“ The Circus Girl ” with more dash and abandon. But
Ethel’s ingenue style doesn’t run to abandon.
Minnie Palmer persists in being as young as ever, if not
younger. At present she is playing name-part in “ The
School Girl” with her flossy hair a-hanging down her
back. Among other giddy-girlish extravagances she sings
a “ bubble ” song, whilst the other alleged school girls sit
around and blow a soap-bubbles chorus.
It is time that somebody warned the ladies of Bland
Holt’s company against adopting a certain clever actor’s
chronic laugh. The habit has been growing upon him
these last three years. He breaks into smiles, and
chuckles at the most inappropriate moments, and the
ladies seem to find it infectious. Miss Hilda Spongcaught
the irritating mannerism (for a love-making scene in
which both parties laugh irreverently is rather irritating),
and now Miss Elizabeth Watson threatens to fall a victim.
Among the many musical virtues of George Howard*
the Melb. ’cellist, was an elegant style of handling his
bow, which he impressed upon his pupils. The lady
members of the Melb. Amateur Orchestral Society 7 and
Howard Conservatorium were dainty fiddlers without ex-
ception. People who didn’t know Howard’s real character
used sometimes to sneer at him for putting on jam, but
the “jam” of that amiable, painstaking artist was de-
cidedly' preferable to the affected soulfulness of the long-
haired musicians who didn’t wash themselves.
When Knowles was added to the Firm’s Melbourne
panto, a local newspaper observed : “If there was one
thing needed to improve ‘ Matsa,’ it was the introduction
of a thoroughly good comedian with an undoubted sense
of humor.” Rather rough on George Lauri, who plays
the chief funny part.
Wilde’s name, in big red letters, being on the Melb.
Bijou streamers, the clergy are warning their Eves against
the forbidden fruit.
A Melb. Herald correspondent protests against the
Brough co. playing a comedy by that “ very monster in
human form,” whose “ filthy, slimy' name stinks in the
nostrils of all decent men and women ” —Oscar Wilde, to
wit. Unthinking rant. On this basis, the solitary ex-
ample of Turner’s painting that hangs in Melbourne
National Gallery ought to be barred, because Turner was-
notoriously', an evil-living man.
Porson : “ If Wilde’s plays are to be burnt, so must the
works of half the classic authors taught to schoolboys.”
Miss Ada Ferrar, the Firm’s leading lady for “ Prisoner
of Zenda,” was released from her contract with Otho
Stuart in order that she might accept George Musgrove’s
engagement. Stuart and Co. presented the fair
voyageuse with a dressing-bag on her departure for Aus-
tralia.
Music-halls, variety-entertainments and concerts were
lately' prohibited in Sweden, by' Act of Parliament, at the
instigation of the public-school teachers, who are seem-
ingly controlled by Ibsen.
Wilson Barrett’s eldest son is gathering “colonial ex-
perience ” on a Maoriland farm.
When the Bancrofts produced “ School for Scandal,” a
lady of the nobility' asked who was the very distinguished
elderly lady so remarkable amid the guests in the play.
Mrs. Bancroft pointed her out as the charwoman of the
theatre.
“ Queen of the Long Ago ” (published by Glen and Co.),
having graceful words by Howard Coghlan and an ortho-
dox catchy' melody by' R. A. Horne, is a new song that
could be made a good deal of by any artistic tenor.
Thus a London correspondent:—“ Imogen, Miss Julia
Arthur ; lachimo, Mr. 11. Cooper Cliffe,” was the an
nouncement during the Xmas holiday s at London Lyceum.
And this because Irving had sprained his foot when play’ing
“ Richard III,” and Londoners were mad to see him and
Ellen Terry again in “ Cymbeline ” —she as Imogen,
Irving as lachimo. It shows that neither of them fears to
give other people a show in their own theatre. Certain
Australian managers please note.
Brisbane (Q.) Musical Union is in Queer-street. It has
been under a “ new constitution ” for two years. It paid
its conductor his first quarter's salary, and hasn’t paid
him a cent since ; now, he asks for a guarantee of at least
£5O a year ! The Union has got a bank overdraft of £2OO,
for which guarantors are responsible ; it is now scratching
its head whether it will let the guarantors sell off its
library (worth £500), or whether it is game to float a co.
to take up the running, in £1 shares.
The Howard Conservatoire of Music, Melb., is, Tiib
Bulletin hears, to be continued under Madame Houyet
Howard’s direction with the same capable staff of teachers
as heretofore. Mme. Howard, a very accomplished
pianiste, was a pupil of Stephen Heller and the celebrated
Henri Herz. Judging from the amount of kindly feeling
in Melbourne towards Mme. Howard, it is anticipated that
the conservatoire will flourish under her direction.
A distinguished Australian lady'-vocalist pensioned her
spouse, in England, till she found him a bigamist.
Among the prisoners to be tried at Adelaide Criminal
Sessions this month for murder is a woman once well-
known on the Australian stage. An illegal operation
went wrong.
Miss “ Belle ” Russell (the Eva of the original produc-
tion of “ Uncle Tom’s Cabin ” in Australia) was married
on Wednesday last to cyclist Parsons. “ Thus that which
was foretold cometh to pass.” When the engagement
was here announced last year it was vigorously denied.
The appearance of The Lucifers for the last week of
“ Matsa ” is advertised as “ owing to the timely closing of
the Sy'dney Pantomime.” “Timely” is good.
The coronation scene in “ Prisoner of Zenda ” will be
the biggest costume-show that W. and M. have staged up
to date. Which is saying a great deal.
“ The Sign of the Cross ” is certain to be played by the
Firm’s new dramatic company. “ Under the Red Robe ”
and “ A Royal Divorce ’ are probabilities.

N.S.W. Govt., m the first seven months of the
present financial year, frittered away £832,700 of loan
moneys, so that the debt keeps increasing at the rate of
£1,400.000 a year. There are no big reproductive works
in progress, but statues and repairs and small patches
and alterations and sand-shifting and scrub-cutting and
similar odd jobs account for the drift. Almost every one
of these is a current expenditure item, but then the
acknowledged current expenditure for the year is already
£318,000 ahead of revenue, and the accounts must he
faked somehow. And even now, despite the wiping off
of all arrears by charging them to the public debt, and
the setting up of the cash basis, Treasurer Reid is still
charging items of expenditure back to previous years,
and thus making things look better than they are. Appa-
rently that cash basis is never going to get quite started.
* * * *
The Victorian Government has to raise a little
over £2,000,000 this year to redeem 4 percent, debentures
falling due, and the question at issue is whether this
amount can be borrowed locally at 3 per cent. If it can’t
the Vic. Government should certainly try a local loan at
3| ; considering the saving in stamp-duty, management
expenses, cost of remitting interest, &c., 3J4 percent,
locally would be cheaper in the long run than 3 per cent,
in London, though it might not look quite so big an advt.
to whoop about in the meantime. And even at 3i the
interest saving would be £15,000 a year.

The Vic. State Land Bank, in January alone,
received applications for loans amounting to over £61,000.
And to meet this demand it is raising cash at the rate of
£25,000 in three months. If the Vic. Land Bank means
business, and doesn’t intend to kill a great idea by
excessive slowness, it needs to dump about £150,000
worth of bonds on the market and go to work in real
earnest.
* * * *
N.S.W. Government now demands income-tax
upon “ interest on mortgages due but not received.” One
man that The Bulletin' knows of has an £BOOO mortgage
of long standing on a property which might now possibly
sell for £6OOO. His interest is sometimes received and as
often not received, and he wants to know where the joy
comes in of .paying tax on £4BO that he often hasn’t got
by way of satisfaction for the ±2OOO which he never
expects to see again. Many others are in very much the
same situation, and if the “due but not received ” clause
is worked for all it is worth, still another streak of blas-
phemy will fill the cornstalk atmosphere.

Melbourne Board of Works is floating in Melb.
at 3£ per cent, a £250,000 loan for more water and sewer-
age works, and a £500,000 loan to redeem an old 5 per
cent, liability for the same amount now falling due. The
Board is off the London market since that dreadful
episode when the wild-eyed poet Fitz Gibbon floated a
£1,000,000 loan in England at 4 per cent., and only got
£9O 17s. for each £lOO debenture, after which the money
was deposited in three banks, one of which burst while the
other two reconstructed.

The Ballarat Banking Co. has a half-year’s pro-
fit of £2937, which, compared with the £3250, £3463,
£3449, and £3710 of the previous four half - years,
shows a pretty steady and continuous decline. The
usual 5£ per cent, dividend accounts for c'2337 ; £5OO is
carried to reserve, making it £52,500, and the remaining
£lOO, added to previous balance, makes £2421 carried
forward. Ballarat is none too prosperous just now, which
probably accounts for the fall in profits, and it looks
about time the local bank was knocking the odd, un-
gainly J per cent, off its dividend to meet the times. The
Ballarat Bank has, as usual, a very large reserve in cash
and State securities — £86,225, equal to 41 per cent, of the
total liabilities to the public ; and it looks, as heretofore,
a thoroughly sound and well-managed institution.

With regard to a remark, in the issue of Jan.
30th, that the entire investments of the Trustees, Execu-
tors and Agency Co. (Melb.), “ only return a shade over
2 per cent.,” and were, consequent!}', to be viewed with
some suspicion, it is now explained that the interest
received (£650) only refers to £27,337 of the investments,
the receipts from the other £35,000 being kept in a sepa-
rate account. This makes the interest nearly 5 per cent,
instead of 2, and entirely removes the suspicion which
apparently lay upon the mortgage business. The Bul-
letin regrets that such a misconception should have
arisen ; at the same time, it thinks the accounts might be
a little more lucid. The chief remaining causes of com-
plaint, therefore, are the £lB,OOO of deposits in the Aus-
tralian Deposit and Mortgage Bank, which are put in at
face value, when their selling price is somewhere between
£12,000 and £13,500 ; and the £14,000 (nominal) of prefer-
ence shares in the same institution, whose present market-
value is much more like £2lOO. These are points which
appear to still require explanation.

Under the provisions of the new Vic. Companies
Act the Royal Bank (Melbourne) proposes to write off
£lso,ooo—half its paid-up capital ; the Commercial of
Australia is writing off £1,200,000; and the Colonial,
which has also some serious writing-off to do, is yet to be
heard from. In the case of the Royal the writing-off
means that one-third of the advances have been lost, and
even when the capital is written down to one-half, the
profits, at recent rates, won’t quite run to a 3 per cent,
dividend. The Royal has a large capital in proportion to
the size of its operations and can stand the shock ; if the
Colonial had to write off one-third of its advances it would
wipe out all its capital in a single act and practically
write off the whole bank.
* * * *
North Queensland Insurance Co. (fire and
marine) has a loss of t'776 to show as the result of a year’s
work, and dividend-paying is suspended. In 1895 the
profit was £3113, and in 1894 it was £3399. Last year the
interest on the co.’s own invested funds more than
covered the loss on the insurance business ; this year the
loss on insurance swallows theinterest. Something appears
to be badly wrong with the management of the North
Queensland, as working expenses for three consecutive
years are £11,585, £13,068, and £16,204, while the business
has actually grown smaller. The sinful enlargement of
the expense-account is the sole cause of the loss ; this
year’s increase alone, for which there is no extra business
to show, has more than swallowed up a 5 percent, dividend
—and in the increase as compared with two years ago a
good 8 per cent, dividend has gone bung. Now that the
N.Q. has to put in £5OO aggregate loss as one of its assets,
it is time for shareholders to kick about the growing ex-
penses.
* * * *
N.S.W. Shale and Oil Co. has a half-year’s profit
of £lOB7 compared with £2507, £6075, and £4998 for
thretfprevious half-years. Dividend is cut down to £3
6s. Bd. per cent. (3d. per share), and even that absorbs
£1250, or £163 more than the earnings. This big co. has
a reserve of £271 and its shares are at 50 per cent, dis-
count and its business, apparently, fading very badly.
Yet it was one of the concerns quoted by Premier Reid
as an instance of how industries prospered under Free-
trade—Reid’s other great example being Hudson Bros.,
now burst and in liquidation.
* * * *
The great Westralian Thirst. Swan Brewery
Co., Perth (W. A.), made £7564 last half-year, and after
paying 341 per cent, dividend (£5508) had £2056 left.
Capital £32,134; reserve, £lO,OOO ; balance to credit of
profit and loss, £14,000 odd. And the Swan Co., with a
profound faith in the continuance of the boom and the
thirst, pays dividends like this with £9967 overdraft un-
pairt and a big- mortgage still on its hotel. They have all
got the same boom complaint in the West.
* * » *
Mont de made £4284 profit for
e last half of 1896. The reliable old pawnshop pavs its
accustomed 10 percent, dividend (£3668); adds i 300 to
contingency fund, making it £6140; carries £3OO to
eserve, making £13,300, and has a trifle over. Even the
f. nt de J’lete, however, seems to feel the pressure of bad
tunes a little, the profits being £4OO less than for two
previous half-years.

, s l °, r *' s pf care was taken to prevent lists of
shareholders in the B.H. South entitled to divs. becoming
public property. The banks where the divs. were payable
were instructed to allow no inspection of the lists—this
pparently to cripple the Adelaide people who were work-
ing up the ructions at the general meeting. It is signifi-
cant that although Broken Hill miners and towns-
“°*d shares to only a very small extent, divs. on
zu,uuu were paid there—a greater number than the
V 1- fcg'sters of any other three companies together
f now - ~ ,'? ether the transference of the balance of power
r s’ n b Melh. to Adelaide would be good or bad, and
w ether the late movement was designed (as has been
uggested) in the interests of Block 14 or not, this at
least is certain : that the management hitherto is de-
nounced heartily locally. A little more up-to-dateness
about the mine would also not be amiss.
Broken Hill's butcher’s bill: 1894, 9 men ; 1895,
18,1896, 13. These were corpses. No account is kept of
limbs lost or spines injured or slag-burns that had cost
months idleness and misery or constitutions ruined by
lead A bad start has been made this year, too. Neither
the Junction nor Block 14 had a fatal accident last year.

The prospectus of the Rockwell Boulder was
lately issued. The mine, it is said, used to be known
as the Dora ; and the Dora, by the way, is not remem-
bered for either good or ill on the Barrier. “The lode
formation,” says expert Phillips, “ is from 15ft. to 18ft.
kHu ' I, ’ but the outcro P shows in places from 40ft. to
DUtt. wide . . The ironstone taken from the outcrop
resembles that found at the B.H. Proprietary, and the ore
discovered at the surface is far richer than that of the
Proprietary when first discovered.” The writer remem-
bers that precisely the same thing was written of about
300 now-deserted “shows” on the West Coast of Tas-
mania ; and then looks in vain for any estimate of the
proportion of ore to lode formation. The Rockwell
Boulder is a speculation pure and simple. It is a prospect-
ing venture, upon which not £5 worth of real
mining has been done, and in those circumstances, and as
the area is only 40 acres (though millions of acres
are available all round), it is not easj - to see why the pro-
moters and vendors should collar about £2OOO clear,
besides 10,000 fully paid-up and 40,000 partly paid-up
shares. Anyway, though, the Rockwell is a very good
district to let the other fellow prove.

Broken Hill’s officially-stated output for ’96 :
Gold, 43890 z., value, £17,117 ; roasted sulphides, £99,811;
matte, 1652 tons, value, £32,503 ; bullion, 18,987 tons,
£870,522 ; ore and concentrates, 372,148 tons, £1,961,521.
The Tarrawingee flux quarries yielded 88,924 tons lime-
stone, valued at £54,621. At the end of the year 5711
men were employed on the B.H. mines, independent of
those on the reducing works outside.
The 600 ft. late developments in the B.H. South
are good ; but so far the body at the deepest level, 800 ft.,
is very disappointing. The 700 ft. bodies are serviceable.
A Broken Hill correspondent:—You Sydney
people seem to know a great deal—or, at any rate, to talk
a great deal—about the B.H. Ore-recovery Co. Tell us,
do, where its claims are. I don’t know. I have just been
on a quest, and have asked at least a score of mining men,
and not one of them knows either. Let us join in the
fun, please.
The Yuba gets an encouraging report from E.
W. Hawker, of Adelaide. Still, it’s in a most unreliable
district, in which more money has been sunk than in any
other section of the Barrier.

Chairman Clarke, at the B.H. North meeting,
owned up to the co.’s financial difficulties, but was san-
guine that a call could be dodged. In a month, when the
new mill is at work, profits, he predicted, will commence.
But they will be very small, and unless t-he Junction and
Junction North lode develops well in the western ground
of the North, divs. are still in the far distance. Still, the
prospects of the North getting the Junction body are
decidedly improving—in other words, The Bulletin’s
theory that the Junction development is an elbow of the
main lode (a theory admittedly shaken severely once or
twice) promises well to come out right, after all. But it
is not to be forgotten (the Junction North people, who
are lending the North folks their workings, haven’t for-
gotten it, anyway) that the underlie out of the North and
into the Junction North is rapid. Obviously, too, Junc-
tion North shares ought to fall as Norths advance-
assuming the North’s advance to be justified ; because if
the North has the ore then it is only at the expense of the
Junction North.

R. E. Kemp, ex-chairman of the Great Cobar
Copper Co., has issued and advertised a circular in which
he gives long and numerous reasons why he was opposed
to the advice given by the board to shareholders, not to
part with their shares. He remarks that since the tribute
was let considerably over 40,000 shares have changed
hands, and it is well-known that these shares, or more
than half the eo., are now held by the trihutors. If Mr.
Kemp would discover and publish “ the reasons” why the
mine was dunderheadedly worked for so many years
without the shareholders being aware of the presence of
gold in the ore or getting any return for it, he would be
telling something that people really want to know. He
says the interests of the trihutors are directly opposed to
those of the other shareholders, therefore he cannot say
that “the shares are now a good permanent investment.”
Be that as it may, the trihutors went into this mine when
the shares (now £2) were down to 3s. 6d. They have paid
the co. many thousands in royalty, and give employment
to upwards of 1000 hands ; they have resurrected Cobar
and proved that every ton of copper averages 4oz. in gold ;
also, they have done many other unobjectionable things
while keeping their weather eye open to their own in-
terests.

Girilambone copper-mine, N.S.W., reports the

The powerful United Exploration Co., of
London, has taken over the Baker's Creek Extended and
the Golden Gate mines, Hillgrove, N.S.VV. If the
parent co. has any sense, it will now admit its defeat
in trying to starve the Extended out, and come to terms,
to enable these mines to be operated on through its
worked-out levels.

Adclong, N.S.W. “Mr. Eissler has declared
the output from the Gibraltar mine for Jan. as l.iOOoz.
from 500 tons. This amount does not include the gold
from tailings, which are rich and will be cyanided.” The
latter is probably intended by the newspaper man as a
compliment. This yield is quite good enough, and the
stone at grass is still very considerable. The point is—
can the 30-head battery he kept going on this grade of
rock? If so, the mine is a much bigger one than was
generally thought, and Eissler is a very able and very
lucky mining man to foresee it. The country rock con-
sists of the hardest granite, the vein is small and frosted
on to the country. Everything that money can provide
to ease things has been done—rock-drills, battery, and
other plant, driven by water power, at a cost of some
£50,000. It only remains for the ore chutes to have much
longer life than others worked to a standstill in the same
camp. The writer sincerely hopes so, but has his “ doots.”

Nundle (N.S.W.) —“ Gazley’s quartz-mine has

bish ?

The Vic. Government wants to establish an
office in London where information about Vic. mines may
be supplied, and to fool away the public money cabling
mining statistics to England, printing boom pamphlets,
and sending round a lurid person to promote the invest-
ment of British capital in the industry. Melbourne Aob
advises also that special encouragement should be given
to the Bull person who conies to take away Victorian gold
by “ granting large areas ” and making the labor condi-
tions easy. This yearning to smooth the path of the
stranger who comes to annex the country’s best asset is
very touching.
* * * *
The story of the Queen’s Birthday United Gold
Mines (Dunolly, Vic.) is a solemn warning to the people
who yearn to develop Victorian mines by the aid of British
capital. Somebody agreed to buy the property for £12,800
oash and £55,000 in paid up shares. Then a British co.
was to be formed to buy it off him for £40,000 cash and
£65,000 in shares. The co. proceeded to issue shares in
order to raise the purchase-money, and the expenses, and
the cash for the first robbers, and so on, but the public
only applied for about 9500 altogether. Then cer-
tain people interested in the promotion of the co.
applied for 40,000 shares, some of them in the name of
“ Thomas Brown ” and other imaginary people, apparently
to make a boom and create a demand. In most cases the
allotment money and the calls remained owing. Then
the 00., on the strength, presumably, of the alleged rush
for shares, started issuing debentures with such bad
success that it owes £26,000 to the debenture-holders,
yet apparently only received £ll,OOO. Finally the co.
burst up. There was no real mining done; its whole
existence was a struggle in a London office to sell shares
and debentures. No capital, apparently, ever came to
Victoria ; no labor worth speaking of was employed, and
the “resources of the province” weren’t “developed”
worth twopence. And of such is the encouragement of
the Australian mining industry by British capital.

Star of the East, Ballarat, slowly thinking over

At last Rutherglen’s boom is within seeing
distance. Three months hence the Great Southern No. 1
and North Prentice should be in big-yield form, and the
Great Southern well on with the cutting of its wash. All

crippled finances will let them.

Rokewood is the failure of Vic.’s alluvial fields.
Year ago it was in the thick of a boom, and to-day the
blind-headed public has a hardly-breathing infant to coo
over. Carr’s Freehold knocks out small divs. for its
working owners, but none of the other shows are feeling
pert. Hanlon’s, going to ladle divs. six months ago,
dangles between 40 and 56 oz. yields, just sufficient to
scrape along without calls, and the prospects no better.
Months back the Rokewood Consols promised fair yrields,
and it is still promising and likely to. Pending a hope-
less wait for calls to come in to put down another bore,
Stanley Proprietary will wind up, and the salted Lord
Salisbury is a buried deed. The black shadow gradually

Hitherto-despised Woods Point looks well this

well are the M’Caul’s Reward, Leviathan, Victor’s Quartz,

M‘Caul’s for all it is worth. “ Will stamp 2oz. t030z.,” the

Long Tunnel, Extended, Walhalla, last week
fulfilled The Bulletin’s early warning by cutting 3ft. of

stock jumped £2, and is likely to go better. Gratifying

tended ground better than the bears appreciate, all
their talk about it making fast into the Long Tunnel
being “ knocked” by the early intersection at the deep

In 1896 the return was down to 69,1350 z., or not much

another year of such luck it will be time for Coolgardie

The Black Flag Proprietary has reconstructed.
When first unfurled it had 600,000 shares, of which
vendors got £525,000. The pound shares once touched
425. 6d., say, £1,200,000 for a show with £75,000 working
capital. Mr. Samuel Gifford, an expert who visited the
property, said the lode was 30ft. wide for 3000 ft. —but at
the 70ft. level it had skedaddled. What a rude thing for
it to do ! The meeting put up another £25,000 and went
home.

The Golden Horseshoe, W.A. (next Ivanhoe),

directors’ fees, £1349 ; law costs, £lO2 ; secretary, £278 ;
consulting-engineer, £275 ; cables, £132, &c., &c. The
four directors seem to be wearing golden horseshoes.
How heavily the London director does sit on Westralian
mining! Just imagine the South German paying £1349
in directors’ fees as compared with £5626 wages as paid
by the Horseshoe ! The co. should change its name to the
Golden Slipper.

Lissner, one of the Queensland Menzies direc-
tors, is more than pleased with the mine after inspection.
He thinks it will take the lead as the hoss mine of the
Menzies camp, with which he is also pleased. “So far
there is nothing to prove that the reefs will not carry
their gold down to great depths.” He says the field
suffers for want of a big central crushing plant. Does it
not suffer for want of timber?

The coming big producers from Hannan’s should
be the Associated Mines, of which W. A. Irwin, formerly
of the Wentworth, N.S.W., is now'superintending manager.
The Australia is the boss lease, and high-grade ore has
been found in several other of the co’s leases. It has sunk
a heap of money in plant and development, but is said to
be on the eve of a big regular output—foreshadowed by
the rising tendency of the shares in a dull, almost dead,
London market.

Stated that Brown Hill mine, W.A., has con-
tracted to ship 2000 tons ore to Dry Creek smelting works,
S.A. The W.A. Govt, has reduced the railway freight, on
ore to jd. per ton per mile, providing the trucks are back-
loaded. Seeing that nine-tenths of the freight is going to
the fields, this should be an easy matter. The concession
means the landing of ore at Dry Creek for less than 30s. a
ton, and will make high-grade mines more independent
of water.

Norseman (W.A.)—“ The manager of Mawson’s
Reward to-day brought in two pieces of very rich quartz
broken out of the drive at the 45ft. level.” It Vas floated
nearly three years ago, has been several times in a money
mud-hole, and was helped out by the promoters—the
W.A. Goldfields Co. Also, it has long bad a battery, but
never crushes. Now it has two lumps of rich rock. What
sort of a boom will it have if the boss finds tw'o more ?

Reported from Adelaide that a man has turned
up with some telluride ore assaying up to 98oz. to the ton

something was struck.

Westralian gold-output for Jan. : 40,3860 z., a

“Five tons of blanketings from the last crush-
ing of the Boulder Main Reef averaged 230 z. to the ton.”
And yet it was wired that the tellurides were lost. Is it
not about time W.A. wires contained some sense, and
that they were better sub-edited at the eastern end?
Five times in six, anything from this mine is put down,
“ Boulder main reef,” whereby the public run away with
the idea that it alludes to the principal reef of the Great

Croydon has won the third position among Q.
gold-fields from Gympie, although drought seriously
affects the output. Total for ’96, 85,9610 z., of which
19,5530 z. were got per cyanide. Total output in ’95,
69,7420 z, the year ’96 showing a substantial increase and
also the largest yield ever made by Croydon. Divs. for the
year exceeded £58,000. Prospects for the ensuing year
are good.
Gympie now takes fourth place with 73,1880 z.
from 63,000 tons of quartz. Yield for ’95, 78,0260 z. Divs.
for last year, £118,832—a decrease on ’95.
Then comes the Etheridge with 26,4330 z
slight increase on ’95. This includes 8000 oz. alluvial and
3000 oz. got by cyanidation of tailings. Next come
Ravenswood with 14,6480 z. ; Clermont with 12,2670 z.;
Gladstone with 58570 z. By the way, what has happened
the gorgeous Mt. Caminadah, that was half gold ; the
magnificent Burrum beaches that were all gold, and half-
a-dozen other El Dorados of the last two years ?

Tasmania, Beaoonsfield, has a .£60,000 share
issue on to cover the new shaft sinking and necessary
machinery equipment. It creates 12,500 £5 shares, paid
up to £2 125., scrippers’ purchase-payments to spread
over tw'o and a-half years. A proposal that will obviate
div.-suspension, but doesn’t it expose the short-sighted
management of this big concern when, after years of div.-
paying, it has to appeal for fresh capital to negotiate un-
avoidable dead work ? The necessity of a new shaft has
stared directors in the face for many a day.

12in. ore-streak that once in a blue moon sprung a 2000 oz.
assay became so monotonous that Southerners had
damned the show’ as a booked funeral, and the aforesaid
strike happened nicely at a time w’hen the scrip was
quivering for a nasty tumble. Metallurgist Schlapp
swears by the C.D.P., but Tas. silver-grubbers wink their
other eye at the show, hence the “ Island ” shareholdings
are very trifling. To test the smelting characteristics ol
the ore 500 cons are breaking.

Rumored again that the Oonah, Zeehan (Tas.)

Despite the warning of returning prospectors,
to which that of Gov. M‘Gregor has been added, men are
flocking to New Guinea at this the worst season of the
year. So far nothing but alluvial has been found, and
not much of that. The prospect is only good enough for
well-equipped parties with money to lose, and at the
right time of the year—commencing about three months
hence. What will happen when some Westralian
boomsters and a newspaper get out there can be easily
imagined, and this will happen very soon after the finding
of gold in reefs is announced.

COOLALTA
S.A. State Children’s Department has
been prosecuting a Chinaman for neglecting to
support some wonderful grandchildren. John
Ahang, Chinee, married Topsy, a black lubra.
Harry Ahang was the resulting skewbald. Harry
Ahang, in his turn, married the daughter of a
Malay husband and Irish wife. The grand-
children, therefore, were quadroons, of the Irish-
Malay-China-Australian blend of spotted black-
fellow.

glovy faces, furored the Slowbart women.”

local butchering firm employs three, and there
are 18 Japs doing three months in Stewart’s

At an inquest on the body of a Smell-
bourne Chow consort, the other day, the bereaved
heathen stated that his “missee ” had been in the
habit of smoking from 10 to 15 shillingsworth of
opium per week. Coroner Youl, remarking that
the lady was a heavy smoker, was corrected by
the interpreter, who said that many Chinese get
through 40 shillingsworth of the drug every week.
As an antidote to Celestial thrift opium is clearly
an excellent thing.

The Chinaman has a strange, uncanny
taste in funerals. A Chinese burial took place re-
cently at Waikomiti (M.L.). Twenty-five cab-
loads of tearful Chow followed the hearse ; pieces
of tissue-paper, each pierced with six holes pre-
sumably so that the air might get through—were
showered from the cab-windows all the way ;
cakes and confectionery were dropped into the
grave, and fusees and crackers were burned around
it. Then the late lamented Mongol was buried,
and gin poured over his resting-place from a
watering-can. Truly this is an upside-down world
where the Aryan goes about with his tongue hang-
ing out for want of a drink, while good gin is
poured over a dead Chow.

Re the forthcoming grand loyal Imperial
shivoo in honor of Her Gracious, hear the Argus :
But the slow-beating and somewhat heavy-footed
British imagination does not lend itself readily to glitter-
ing ceremonial. The average Briton always marches in a
procession with an air of half-ashamed protest, and
arrays himself in a many'-colored official costume with an
inarticulate sense that he is making himself ridiculous.
Garn ! What about the average Britisher’s lodges,
societies, orders, associations, &c., &c., the chief
reason for the existence of which appears to be in
the opportunity they afford the average Briton of
arraying himself in ridiculous clothes, and glaring
sashes, and parading the street, with his glittering
chest thrown out a yard, and his eye in fine frenzy
rolling ?
Melb. Herald : “The object (of the grand
Imperial corrobboree to be held in June next) is to
honor the greatest Sovereign that has ever occupied
the Throne of the Empire to which we are proud
to belong.” This is the kind of dreadful drivel
that will appear in the press for the next four
months. It seems almost incredible that any par-
tially sane or sober journalist should identify the
discoveries and achievements of science and in-
dustry, and the progress in art and literature, that
have taken place during the reign of Queen Vic-
toria with that very ordinary little person herself.
Yet readers of Roman history still profess to think
that the world must have been mad when some of
the Caesars were worshipped as gods ! One step
further and the British loyalists of to-day will be
as mad as the.old Romans were. That step will
probably be taken in June, and we shall become —
for a time, until the reaction arrives—a nation of
besotted isolators.

At a Melb. police-court, the other

One of the intruders had five convic-

transpired, didn’t possess an apple-tree,
but the Bench let the apple-seekers off
with a £r> fine. The Bulletin men-

On one of the W.A. fields lives
a doctor who is a perfect misogynist.
His brow becomes corrugated, and his
eye stormy, when an obstetrical case
looms ahead. On no account will he
go into a female’s apartment unless
there is a third person present, and
barmaids are his especial aversion. Once
he was called upon to attend one of
these vestals, a regular “spanker.”
The landlord, a bachelor, in obedience
to his mandate, shuffled in diffidently
after him, but the moment the lady
proceeded to unbosom herself for the
stethoscope he rose and muttered that
he had better withdraw. “ Stay where
you are,” said the local Abernethy, “ or
I will go too ! And how much spirits
have you been in the habit of drinking
each day ? ” he pursued, casting a pecu-
liar side-long glance of dislike ac his
pearl-powdered patient. “Oh, doctor!
it’s a thing I never touch,” she modestly
ejaculated; “ whatever are you treat-
ing me for ? What are you going to
do?” “I have not yet made up my
mind,” replied Medicus, “ but for the
present we will call it congestion of
the liver. And as to what lam going
to do, I intend to do what I think right
and proper.” The exhibition largely
comprised bromide.

The inane exaggeration by a Sydney even-

the capture of Butler may lead to complications.
Under the cable agreement between the big Aus-
tralian dailies, any paper which obtains a message
from an outside source is liable for a heavy sum.
It is scarcely to the interests of the journal in
question, which apparently got its information
from a very outside source indeed, to break up a

Sydney Evening News got home neatly
on its reptile contemporary :
In America, in San Francisco particularly, headlines are
a high branch of art. “ Mutiny on the Swanhilda.”—
“ Fights on the Deck.” —“ Officers and Crew in Conflict.”
—“A Floating Hell,” &c., would, for instance, convey to
the reader unused to the guileful ways of San Francisco
that definite news had been received of some fearful
trairedy.
In San Francisco—ahem ! This is much prettier
and more biting than the memorable “Ananias”
squabble.

The arrest of Butler was a disappointment
in almost every way. Nothing happened as it
should have done, or was expected to do. Captain
Frazer didn’t put Butler in irons after receiving

a “floating hell” —in fact, all the voyage he was a

jump ovei’board and swim for Ins life outside the
Holden Gate, nor did he show fight and wade in
the gore of the slaughtered American policeman.
He didn t even curse picturesquely when he was
captured, or attempt suicide on landing. The
only remarkable incident so far is that a Califor-
nian lady has claimed him as her long-lost hus-
band, and even that di >esn’t necessarily amount to
anything. If a lady has a long-lost husband of
the same name, and she wants to prove his death
and get married again, it is a stroke of policy to
fix his identity on Butler. That enterprising
person has so good a chance of hanging by all pre-
sent appearances that he is probably the most
convenient man going just now for the purposes
of a lady who wants to prove that somebody
named Butler is defunct.

The stringent conditions laid down in
international treaties that a man on extradition
can only be tried for the offence for which he is
extradited are very necessary. Apropos, a present
well-known Sydney resident once living in Maori-
land was “wanted” in N.S. Wales. There was
no way of getting at him unless by warrant, so a
bogus charge of indecent assault upon a little girl
was formulated, and upon this the Sydney S.M.
granted a warrant. The accused was arrested in
M.L. and brought to Sydney, whereupon the
charge was withdrawn and another substituted
upon which defendant was convicted. The con-
viction was upheld on appeal to the Full Court,
but on further appeal the Privy Council derided
the whole proceedings and ordered accused’s dis-
charge—after 18 months’ imprisonment.

Thief got all the money in two cases. Even about

Dr. Lloyd, J.P. : “ Do you admit that Daphne, Myrtle,
Olive, Rose and Joseph are your children ! ”
Defendant (scratching his head): “I admit the first
four, but I am not sure about Joseph.”
Case adjourned for 28 days to allow defendant
time to make sure about Joseph. Joseph was
always an unlucky name.
Mrs. Carew, it was cabled the other day,
was after all convicted at Yokohama of poisoning
her husband ; the alleged confession by the gover-
ness, therefore, seems to have been a herring
drawn across the trail of justice. Apropos, the
name of Mrs. Maybrick appears in the papers
again, surrounded by much cheap sentiment or
righteous indignation. Most people think she is
innocent, or rather she ought not to have been
convicted. Mrs. Maybrick is (or was when
last seen) a young, handsome, and interesting
womm, and therefore every man under 70, and a
considerable number above that venerable age,
swear she is innocent. To immure a beautiful
woman or a clever man is simply an outrageous
waste of rare and p recious material,

The Rosebrook (Vic.) horror throws an-

horror-stricken by the story of the Lyfield family
life at Rosebrook. Equally bestial dealings are
reported (and not always in whispers) from every
thinly-populated country district in Australia.

be the breeding - place of some of the vilest
humanity on God s earth.

Sydney girls now ride atop
of ’buses in such numbers that man,
the smoker, will soon have to ride
inside. Until a couple of months
back, they would only climb up
top on particularly festive occa-
sions. When is Sydney to have
’buses, constructed on the sensible
London plan, with stairs, to ob-
viate accidents or immoderate dis-
plays of petticoat ? The- present
vehicles were built to break necks
and give bystanding johnnies pal-
pitation of the heart.
Alongside the two suicided skeletons (male
and female) recently discovered in the bush at
Plimmerton (M.L.) was an unsigned letter in a
bottle. It read as follows : “ Never mind who we
are. We are tired of life. We have left £7 for
burial expenses.” The £7 were also in the bottle,
so a police department with any poetry in its soul
might about as well have respected their incog-
nito, and planted them as “Unknown.” But
instead of doing this, it set to work and labori-
ously dug out the fact that the man was a person
of no importance from Gisborne, and that the
woman was his Second Mrs. Tanqueray, and that
they were both a bad lot from a strictly Social
Gimlet aspect. So having successfully blasted the
moral character of their bones, the law dropped
them into a grave, in a convenient place where
people of uneasy virtue can come rbund on Sun-
day and draw a horrible inference comfortably
after lunch.

A domestic servants’ union has been formed
in Melb., and the great unanimous Bridget rolled
up in a score, with a keen eye to the cash. Ap-
parently Bridget was very willing to be united,
and very unwilling to pay for it. The Argus
report goes:—
Mr. Barker then proposed that the entrance-fee should
be Is., and the subscription 3d. per week.
A Lady : That’s a shilling a month.
Mr. Barker: Yes.
The Lady : And when a member is out of work they
don’t have to pay.
Mr. Barker : Quite so.
The Lady : But there’ll be something to draw.
Mr. Barker : I don’t think any young lady here, or old
lady for the matter of that, wouid bother about a shilling.
Another lady proposed that no entrance fee should be
charged for the first month. The motion was carried
unanimously.
Mr. Barker : Well, no entrance fee for the first month.
What about the 3d. ?
The First Lady : I think it’s too low.
Another lady said that she had consulted with various
other ladies, who thought 3d. per week too high.
The salary of the secretary was fixed at 10s. per quarter,
and of the treasurer at ss. per quarter.
The Bulletin doesn’t exactly envy the male mis-
sionaries who are schooling Bridget to awake and
arise. But probably there will be kitchen pickings
and privileges.

The Domestic Servants’ Union has got a
fine field to work on in Melbourne (writes a Bulle-
tin correspondent). At one public palace this
writer wots of, bossed by an eminently re-
spectable and pre-eminently pious directorate,
the willing girls are worked to death or close up
in a few months; the other sort leave after the
first week, and their wages are confiscated to the
glory of the holy shareholders. The hours, ac-
cording to the girls, are from six o’clock in the
morning “ till we cannot possibly keep awake any
longer.” It is not an unusual thing for the diners
to see one or more of the waitresses plump down
in their midst in a dead faint, the result of long
hours and exhaustion, and the general appearance
of the servants would lead a stranger to imagine
lie had struck a convalescent-home. The male
hands stay a fortnight on an average, and then
generally leave after attempting an aggravated
assault on the manager. The patrons of this es-
tablishment are all of “the better class,”and their
callous indifference under the circumstances is a
sickening thing to see.
Down South a little passing interest has
been aroused by the case of a young lady who
retired to the seclusion of a stable, and there poured
kerosene over herself and set herself on fire. From
a suicidal point of view the scheme was a failure ;
the patient was much blackened, but she emerged
from the stable alive and active, though minus
most of her clothes and hair. Then she told a
thrilling story about how her lover had taken off
her boots and held her feet in the fire and set her
alight in a number of places ; but after a while,
the lover being able to prove an alibi, she with-
drew this narrative and refused to give any further
account of herself. A Victorian young lady,
aged 16, has also created a sensation by causing
the arrest of her brother, aged 18, on a charge of
criminal assault and being the father of her
illegitimate child. When the trial came on, how-
ever, she climbed into the witness-box and said, in
an off-hand way, that it was all a lie, and she
didn’t know why she had said it. Later on she
said she had done it to shield another man whose
name she didn’t know. Further on she said that
she knew the other man’s name but wasn’t going
to tell it. Also, she didn’t know where he lived
anyhow, he had gone away—likewise she declined
to give his address. The usual remarks about God-
less education, and the crying need for more
accurate information about the ancient Jebusites
to keep the rising generation straight, come in
here nicely.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Feb. 9, 1897.
Mr Dear Myee—
“ The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown "
opened at the Criterion on Saturday evening with
a rustling of fashionable frills and much society
chatter. The old familiar faces of the first-
nighters adorned the d.c. Even the alcoves were
occupied by dressy patrons of the play, and one
stage-box was principally taken up by a returned
artist with coppery locks, an ample smile, and a
made-in-London frock. Another box was graced
by a party including the society dame who parts
her hair a l’Americaine and is devoted to the
drama. Frank Thornton, disguised as the girl,
gives his sex away by his masculine stride and
also his boots, which, with man-like uppers, end
abruptly at the ankles, whereas girls’ toe-crushers
always gracefully extend some inches up the leg.
Noney Seabrooke, the newcomer, wears pretty,
girly gowns ; Bessie Rignold shows the touch of
the tar-brush in the girl from Demerara by in-
serting herself into gaudy garments and being ready
to love any eligible at a moment’s notice.
The glimpse of a whole boarding-school in night-
apparel brings Miss Brown up to date. No
modern farce is complete without a nightgown.
Even ballets —there was one in the panto—must
now be danced in white longeloth. Nightgown-
humor is adapted from the French farce, which
will be seen here soon under its English name, “A
Night Out ”; the boom began by taking scenes
from it piecemeal, until some clever adaptor dis-
covered a new sort of whitewash warranted not to
crack, and translated the whole play. But if the
English version is one night out, the original is a
whole week in the country with champagne gratis
and all exes. paid.
This month is fashion’s ebb-tide. The woman
who haunts Summer sales and buys weird and
wonderful bargains has but a few weeks in which
to wear them ere Autumn glories shine in the
shop-windows. It is a cheering sight on a muggy
February or March day to see a big drapery show-
window decked out with velvet and chinchilla, re-
produced in the shop next door as velveteen and
dyed rabbit. Velvet is going to be popular ; it is
a becoming fabric, except for a fat woman ; but
fashion ignores the fat woman, or mercilessly com-
pels her to enswathe a hardly-indicated waist with
folded bands of silk, and to accentuate her plump
curves by making them overflow all round a tight
little “ bolero ” jacket. All sorts of spangly, jetty,
beaded trimming is going to successfully augment
the bills for our next season’s gowns. What with
velvet and spangles and beading, a woman dressed
t 6 date will only want a topical song and a trans-
formation-scene to be a whole pantomime.
“Useful blouse lengths at slaughtering prices ”
are a great sale attraction, and just now they
dominate the whole costume of woman. The
blouse-and-skirt has had its death-knell rung many
times, but always resuscitates itself the next
season as cheerfully as ever. For between-tiines
it is the most useful wear. The possessor of a
much-enduring black skirt and some assorted
blouses can ring the changes on her upper gar-
ments, and come up smiling at every festive
gathering with a satisfied expression, implying—
“ I’ve got another blouse.”
The most prominent incidents about the revival
of the “Lights o’ London,” on Saturday at the
Royal, were Mr. Marcus’ song, introduced in the
overture like the prologue to “ Pagliacci,” and the
flaming pink head-dress of a girl in the d.c.
Some audience went out between the acts to
federate at the political meeting over the road
and forgot to come back, but the tearful classic
attracted a fair house. Hetty Preene (Ada Guild-
ford) exhibited gilded infamy in rather a sad-
colored gown, while the woeful Bess Marks was
draped in tea-leaf-hued clothes, and, of course,
wore no hat, but took her misery bareheaded.
Saturday’s tug-of-war and cycle sports on the
Agricultural Ground at Moore Park attracted a
middling-sized crowd. The “gate,” which goes
towards the building up of the impending Aus-
tralian Fair at Easter, was increased by girls with
baskets who made purchasers interpret the sport-
ing idea by handing out large coins for little
flowers and indifferent tobacco. The cycling
child maniac is evidently going to be the very last
development of this tired century. As the racers
hummed by with a crackling rush, some infantile
girls in the front seats shouted enthusiastically as
they barracked for their favorites. One rider,
bound in bright blue satin and gold like a prayer-
book, was much encouraged from the reserve.
Men had the glory of the gowning. The Cardinal
flashed his red robes all over the place like a
danger-signal; and beside the red - and - blue
jacketted tug-of-warsmen the women looked
sartorially faded.
At a singing-pupils’ concert given privately last
week, one of the girls, who comes from Central
Q., warbled in a florid Italian way so remarkably
as to show herself another, and the very nicest,
possessor of the now world-renowned Australian
voice. The young singer is merely a student as
yet. Beginning, like Melba, as a contralto, she is
now capable of bringing out clear trills anywhere
above the stave. Most girls gifted with any tones
deeper than a shrill canary-like warble fall into
the contralto error early in life, and are taught to
growl out deep chest-notes like a hurricane whist-
ling through a keyhole. Melba’s example has
now proved that many of these rich, full-throated
tones belong to the dramatic soprano, a most valu-
able voice commercially.
Victoria Club members turned up at the Mon-
day evening meeting to listen to various musical
performers and to a lecturess with a large collec-
tion of chestnuts culled from the records of Her
Gracious, who was held up to admiration because
she pays her debts—which isn’t hard to do on
£lOOO a day—and has always kept herself
thoroughly respectable, also an easy matter on
the same terms. Her devotion to “ Albert the
Good ” was also descanted upon, the lecturess
pointing out how thankful all H.M’s loving sub-
jects should be to have a monogamous monarch
reigning over them. The little paper was further
remarkable for not once containing the words
“record reign,” and ignoring John Brown and
all his kilts. The club-house has now a cosy
look, and if men-members could be lured in from
the balcony by being allowed to smoke somewhere
indoors, all might yet be well.
A N.S.W. athlete visiting Maoriland writes
enthusiastically to his friends of the fascinations
of the women in the cities of both islands. “Most
of them are pretty, though they crop their hair
short and dress in tweed bags. They don’t expect
you to wait on them, and they take their turn in
shouting their male friends long beers.” This
seems to be the most advanced stage which the
“new” female has yet attained, and among
women so emancipated it is a surprise to find the
petty, old-fashioned female traits still existing.
A school committee in the Hawera region, inves-
tigating charges brought against a head master of
kissing some of the female teachers, found that
in consequence “ considerable friction now exists
among the teachers.” The woman who could
tolerate “the nasty fast cat ” sharing kisses with
her has not yet been discovered even among the
up-to-date M.L. sisterhood.
The wife of a Sydney professional man can take
a pencil in hand and, sitting in a dreamy, trance-
like state, produce strange curly-wurlies and
marvellous faces with fearsome frowns, and
orchidaceous flowers and other marvels. The lady
has never been taught drawing, and these produc-
tions are set down to the “spirits” who vaguely
wander about, and, for purposes best known to
themselves, inculcate art by proxy. Another
dreamy-eyed lady of uncertain age, in a non-com-
mittal bonnet, joins in these inspirations, and,
seizing a note-book, writes therein hurried sen-
tences, explaining the pictures. The remarks,
like the drawings, might mean anything* and
half-an-hour of the seance makes the outsider very
tired. , , „ -
A confirmation service at a suburban church
was glorified by a historical lace veil worn by one
of the girls presented for treatment. The yellow
heirloom was made by a female convict of skill
60 years ago at Parramatta, and has been used in
similar ceremonies many times since. Two
generations of laving-on of sacerdotal hands must
have given the relic the odor of sanctity.
“Ripening Sunbeams” was recently lent to
Hobart Art Gallery ; consequently local sassiety
suddenly took an intense interest in the place and
the Nicest women sat for hours in front of the
picture and talked, while the common herd craned
their necks in the background. A cable was sent
requesting the loan of “ Ripening Sunbeams ” for
another week. The consenting cable came from
Lord B. about an hour after the steamer left with
the picture on board. Then ensued a whole day
of gushful regret.
“The wedding that did not come off,’ is a stale
newspaper sensation, but such a wedding really
didn’t happen some time ago in Prahran (Vic.).
When the bride, cake, guests, &c., were ready and
waiting for the bridegroom, he sent a wire instead
saying he was ill and had gone to the country for
a change. Strict search by an irate mother-in-
law-elect discovered the man so unwilling to face
the music lurking in his office. Result—a breach-
of-promise case, «£75 damages awarded the bride
by Jtidge Hood, and a long lecture for the dis-
sembler on his perfidy. His Honor remarking that
the girl ought to be willing to pay any money to
get rid of such a man. This is one of the very
few actions for breach with sense in them. The
plaintiff had suffered both in business —she is a
dressmaker—and in her neighbors’ esteem by such
an abrupt defection on her young man’s part, and
the law-suit cleared her. And, after all, neigh-
bors’ gossip is a great factor in life.
One of the smartest dog-carts in the city adver-
tises its proprietor—a theatrical manager—as
effectively as a four-foot poster. It is a gorgeously
glitteringiy-harnessed cart, and the icy hauteur
of the menial on the back seat stamps the turn-
out genuine. A private carriage should always
own a coldly-correct flunkey. The hired “ landau”
is generally given away by the free-and-easy air
of a coachman with no more style than a ’bus
driver. Two ladies, who one day hired a vehicle
of decayed splendor to visit some opulent acquaint-
ance in a far-distant suburb, on emerging from
the house disgustedly observed the equipage
drawn up in the shade with the spirited steeds
dejectedly drooping their heads, the coachman
lying under the tree sound asleep, and a general
air of “ four-bob robbo ” about the whole turn-
out, quite visible to the hostess watching the
departure between the slats of her drawing-room
blind.
After a “ toney ” ball at one of the Mountain
resorts, an ambitious damsel, who had broken
through the rigidity of the district caste laws and
been chaperoned by a lofty visiting magnate, was
escorted home by an impressionable partner. She
didn’t want him to see that pa’s house was
weatherboard, with four rooms and a lean-to, and
so passed the front gate innocently, and didn’t
pause until they came to a two-storeyed gabled
mansion, standing in aristocratic seclusion behind
a tree avenue. “As it’s so very late, I shan’t ask
you in,” she said, sweetly, at the gate. But, “ Oh,
I’m going in myself,” the young man from town
replied, “ my family are renting this place for the
summer.” So the poor thing had to own up, and
was hurled for evermore from among the seats of
the local mighty.
In the backblocks, where there are no benches
in the parks, the necessary support to the local
love-making is given by logs. There is a way-
back township where—as in many others—the
chief evening’s amusement for a girl is to be taken
into an adjacent paddock and hugged. A new-
chum was taken round the place by a prominent
townsman and shown the places of interest—
among others the noted courting-spots, each log
the property of a particular couple. “That’s
Jessie Brown and Jack Smith’s log; that one’s
Susie Blank’s log.” “But which is yours?”
asked the stranger. “Oh,” said the leading
citizen importantly, “/have the goods-shed up
at the railway-station.”
Writes my Melb. correspondent :
“One of Victoria’s richest squatting crowds
starved out the local shepherd a little while back
because a lady of the clan took to herself his re-
marks on that Biblical liigh-kicker, Herodias’
daughter. The present incumbent promptly
poured oil and honey into the wounds dealt by his
predecessor. But, for all his crying ‘Peace,
Peace ! ’ there is no peace in the kirk at present’
owing to a fierce family feud between two factions
of his principal patrons—the great people aforesaid.
The trouble began on a recent Sunday when the
head of the house, arriving late for church with a
party of vice-regal visitors, found the ancestral
curtained pew monopolised by a younger brother
and his comparatively insignificant following. So
far from vacating the hallowed ground, the
usurper calmly ignored the newcomers, to the fury
of the rightful owner, who skipped down the aisle
snorting audibly, and vainly ordered the local con-
stable, whom he met outside, to rush into the
sanctuary there and then and eject his bad little
brother.
“ Daylesford has been all agog lately over the
enforced return of its prayerful prodigal lawyer
Geake and the emptiness of the husks left for his
creditors. The other day, when he was hourly
expected back from Monte Video, an outsider
suggested to the wanderer’s advance guardian that
it would be hard work keeping the defrauded
widows and spinsters of the district from scratch-
ing out the absconder’s eyes. ‘No fear ! ’ replied
the official, who knew his Daylesford, ‘ every in-
solvent she in the place, if she had the show, would
gladly hang round his neck, and, as of old, take
her little bill to the Lord in prayer on his recom-
mendation.’
“ Whether due to the effect of mineral water on
the system or to the influence of empty shafts and
deserted batteries on the nerves, Geake’s fellow
townsmen impress the newcomer as an emotional
and confiding community. Theosophists, palmists,
and spiritualists are all more or less in evidence,
and a sententious ancient, who professes to cure
erysipelas by reciting a sentence or two from the
German grammar, is an honored guest at fashion-
able afternoon teas. Her popularity is quite dis-
interested too, for, unlike green-apple colic, ery-
sipelas is by no means prevalent in Daylesford.
“ Melb. shopkeepers complain that while they
are blamed for working their employes until mid-
night, the customers themselves are the culprits.
Women habitually delay their shopping till the
eleventh hour and then linger lovingly at the
counters. On Xmas Eve the hands at the biggest
sell-all firm in Melb. almost despaired of tasting
the morrow’s goose. Customers arrived in crowds,
and the later it grew the thicker they came. At
last the head of the house himself was summoned
to close the doors, but it was one o’clock before he
succeeded, and then there was all the tidying up to
do. While this was going on, a belated customer
battered outside and shrieked that she hadn’t a
morsel of butter or cheese for Xmas day, until, for
the sake of peace, she was let in by a side door.
“In the same way, boarding-house keepers and
proprietors of seaside resorts wash their hands of
the hysterics, varicose veins, housemaids’ knees,
and similar fatigue complaints prevalent amongst
holiday parlor-maids and waitresses. Intending
tourists wait until all the houses are full, then they
badger the various hosts with imploring telegrams
and offers to share beds and dine on tinned fish.
Whether these overtures are declined or not, the
laggards arrive just the same at all hours of the
night and day, carrying crying children and trust-
ing to Providence for bed and board. At this
stage the domestic staff loses its head, and pru-
dent lodgers, who came in time, have to suffer for
the sins of others, for no one ever gets his second
brew of tea in his own cup or uses a towel not
borrowed from someone else’s room.
“ Talking of the sea-side, Lome, where Pre-
mier Reid went these holidays, was deservedly
popular for many years as a place frequented by
eligible bachelors. Now that most of the Victorian
men have gone to W.A., the girls they left behind
them feel shockingly lone and lorn. On every
side, boys still at mammy’s apron-strings con-
descend loftily to their fiancees, the belles of their
respective suburbs. The plisrht of plainer damsels
is even more pitiable. This year at Lome,
attracted, no doubt, by the old reputation of the
spot, the proportion of girls to men was roughly
computed as 60 to 10.
“ The level-headed mother of the two leading
Melb. lady-doctors has plenty of maternal
admiration for her girls, but precious little
respect for the patients who supply them with
practice. The old lady doesn’t believe in sickness,
medical attendance, and physic. There was never
any serious sickness in her family, she says, and if
there had been she would have cured it all herself
without sending for a doctor, male or female.
Evidently the enthusiastic daughters didn’t in-
herit their taste for the profession from dear
mamma.
“ Mrs. Maesmore Morris, the Melbourne
beauty, who has hitherto been on show privately,
is now to ‘go on ’ in the ‘ Prisoner of Zenda’ at
the Princess’s for Williamson and Musgrove, and
exhibit herself to all and sundry. She is worth
looking at, being as near to the ideal beauty of
the lid of a chocolate-cream box as one has ever
seen. She has a delicate pink and white skin,
which stage-paint is not likely to improve, and an
expression that brings to mind Tennyson’s line
‘ insipid as the queen upon a card.’
Yours affectionately,

SPORTING NOTIONS .
The Martin-Lewis match was a dreary fiasco
perpetrated in the midst of blinding sleet and mud. The
one-mile event looked square. Martin rode as usual,
hanging behind his man until half-a-lap from home, when
he rushed out. Lewis made his dash same moment, but
when there was 100yds. to go Martin was up to his elbow.
Then the Australian caught sight of the Yank’s rush, and,
making another effort, ran in a winner by half a length.
In deference to the public, who howl unless a race is run
at top speed from start to finish, the mile was paced, but
badly.
The ten-miles looked very fishy. As early as
three miles Lewis looked thoroughly done up, while the
iron man was plugging away joyfully half-a-lap in front.
But suddenly the Yank failed to follow his pace, and in
two more rounds the competitors were together. Then
Lewis took a turn in front, and Bill’s shoe started coming
off his foot, or his foot started coming out of his shoe—
the officials say ; to the outsider the appearance of both
acts is much the same—and he didn’t get a move on him
until half-a-lap from home. Then came Martin’s charac-
teristic run just a length too late. Bill’s boot must have
damaged his judgment as well as his riding.
The Five-Mile race, run off for =£2s—added by
the League in the event of one man winning the first two
races—was a walk-over for the Yank., who went out from
the first and lapped his opponent at three miles.
Then a meeting was held without Bill, who had
left the ground, and it was decided that the absent guest
had been working too hard of late, and that he should
rest for two years. Lewis, whose riding appeared to out-
siders fair and square throughout, was suspended until
Tuesday, when his case was to be heard.
Betting on the three events of the match : One
mile, 3tol on Lewis; ten miles, 5 to 4 on Lewis; five
miles, stol on Martin. They know something at St.
Kilda, as J. G. Knowles would say.
Bilmartin, while alleging that he did his best
throughout, blames the Red Bird man for his defeat by
not providing pace for him; with even pacing, he says,
he could beat Lewis any time over 10 miles—which ali
spectators of Saturday endorse.
Martin’s pacing arrangements were execrable,
and none of the riders appeared to have any knowledge
of their places or to know who was steering the machines.
Three men, obviously novices on multicycles, got on one
of the triplets, and they hadn’t gone 50yds. before they
fell. Another trial was productive of another fall, and
the men were then led away. On the other hand, Martin
numbered among his pacers a triplet steered by Hourigan,
the same man who acted as helmsman in the best team
at the Yank’s disposal in his match with Parsons.
Bilmartin is dead as far as Australia is con-
cerned. for, though he may appeal to the Racing Board,
there is not even Butler’s chance of the stewards’ decision
being reversed. If Bill was guilty, his punishment was
richly deserved, and no lover of sport could do otherwise
but endorse it, yet all who have been used to seeing the
pluck, stamina, and extraordinary determination of the
junky little roan when his adamantine jaw hung over the
handlebars can help dropping a passing tear at the thought
that Australian tracks will know the red and white hoops
no more.
Martin threatens to ride at unregistered meet-
ings if rubbed out finally, and savs that perhaps he’ll
make more money there than under the League. Perhaps.
But whom will they get to ride against him ?
The 10-mile championship of Victoria was won
by Kuhle, the lanky man from South Melb., who has been
making some marvellous sprints this season, while yet
scoring not a single big win. Kuhle is one of the best, if
not the best, finisher Australia possesses. Porta, who
ran second, protested against Kuhle for crossing him
within the length-limit, and had his five shillings for-
feited for frivolity.
“ I ain’t an angel. I’m a man tryin’ to make
all the money I can, but I wan ter make the money
honestly and honorably.” Bilmartin in his protestation
of innocence.
Martin claims that he was disqualified but once
before reaching Australia, and then unfairly, and at no
time was he ever accused of non-trying. By the w*ay
Martin never rode in America under the L. A.W.; his
performances in the States were all at unregistered
meetings.
• • • •
After bursting Bilmartin’s records on Tuesday
at St., Kilda track, Lesna was simply “dead to the
world.” Yet all he did was to out down the Yank’s flying
start five miles by 11 3-ssec. and his 10 miles by 39 4-sseo.
from a stand. Lesna had everything favorable. There
was not a breath of air, and he waited three-quarters of
an hour for the track to dry before he mounted his
machine. Also, he had as good, or better, pacing than
Martin, and every incentive to travel.
Lesna’s stable aver that Martin was only a
third-class man on good Continental tracks ; but the pro-
babilities are that this same third-classer will knock the
bottom out of the Gaul’s times when he next tries.
Lesna’s two “managers,”Raymond Pognon and
Prosper Ulmo, are the most striking figures on Melb.
tracks at present, and their coats are things of loveliness
which drive thrills of envy through the soul of local
? i'i nl ™T'L Pognon affects a loose flapping - tailed
clobber which gyrates like the draperies of a skirt-dancer
as he gesticulates; Ulmo, who is the elder and of the
more serious type of Frenchman, is enveloped in a huge
brown ulster all pleats and pearl buttons, which merely
permits his hat to peep over the collar and allows his feet
to stray beneath its skirt. To see Pognon, Ulmo and
Lesna conferring is one of the sights of the day.

Kendall.
Chas. Hallo’s recently-published memoirs
refer to that remarkable Sydney Chinaman,
“ Geeong Tarr.” Which is indeed a cruel blow to
local Presbyterianism.
Queen Vic.’s invitation to the Australian
Premiers to visit London for her 60-years’ celebra-
tion is evidently based on false hopes. All the
Australian Premiers are married.

W. Redmond, M.P. for Home Rule Land,
Btands Australian heat well. He has added a
stone to his avoirdupois since arrival, and has

Louis Becke’s marine “jungle stories,
which were begun in Pall Mall Gazette during
Cust’s editorship, and ceased when Oust and Astor
quarrelled and the former left, are now being con-
tinued in the Daily News and Daily Chronicle.
Oust has gone to South Africa.
Obit.: T. J. West, son of James West,
one of the first settlers at Macquarie Plains when
Bathurst was a penal settlement. “ Tom ” was
born on the Plains, and at one time represented
Carcoar in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly—a circum-
stance which was simply his ruin. At that time
he owned the beautiful homestead of Cudgelo,
was a leading sportsman, and the best handicapper
of his day.
Miss Anne Jane Duncan, who becomes
first female inspector of N.S.W. factories (at .£lBO
a year) won the appointment from a large number
of highly-educated and socially-influential women.
In fact, her appointment proves how necessary
independent commissioners are, for had a Minister
of the Crown been patron he would have found it
as much as his office was worth to have resisted
the influence behind many of the candidates.
If Premier Reid should decide, despite
his present refusal, to visit England to cele-
brate Queen Victoria’s record reign, he will
command the silence of many of his political
opponents who countenanced G. Republican
Dibbs in carrying the Premiership abroad on
a no more useful mission. When Dibbs went
Barton became Acting-Premier. When Stuart
went to Maoriland, Dailey acted for him. And
when Reid goes (if he goes), Carruthers will be
his deputy. Old Parkes always liked to take the
Premiership about with him when he went abroad.
C. G. Wade, N.S.W. acting
District Court Judge, is spoken
of as a certainty for the first per-
manency on that bench. He
is an old King’s-school boy,

X. Z. : “ The other day I
met a curious case of incipient
mania. The trouble was that the
patient’s particular form of mad-
ness was the idea that he was
going mad. The fact that he was
becom i n g ord inar ily un m anageable
was plain; at the same time his
knowledge of the same fact would
have to be taken as proof of his
sanity. The problem is left for
others to solve.” The law is—it
may be an expedient but it is a
most unphilosophical law —that
the man would be fully responsible
for his actions. The law does not
recognise the co-existence of an
irresistible impulse to do wrong
and a knowledge of the difference
between right and wrong.
Minister Peacock, of the
wondrous chortle, was leaning up
against Melb. Exhibition Building
sunning himself, after doing good
service for his country on A.N.A.
when a small, sticky
Australian, with a grimy face,
leading a smaller, stickier, and
more grimy brother by the hand,
interviewed him. “You’re Mr.
Peacock, ain’t yer?” asked the
diminutive native. The great
Minister nodded. “ Look here,”
continued the small boy, “I’ll
give you this apple if you’ll laff
fer my little brother, he wants t’
’ear yah.” Aleck laughed until
the dome shook, and when he re-
covered the ytgng Australians had
disappeared, and he held an apple
in his hand.
E. Y. Lowry, who went to prison as a
Socialist martyr once, on being re-elected as a
Townsville (N.Q.) alderman, last week, declined
to thank those who had voted for him, declaring
that it was their duty to thank him for having
devoted his time to their interests.
Sargood will not yet retire from the
directorship of the Commercial Bank of Australia.
He had intended to go to Japan with his family,
but will now delay his trip till next year, owing
to the Federal Convention, to which he expects to
be elected. The Commercial management blesses
the occasion, therefore, because Sargood’s retire-
ment would have been bound to be interpreted
with many embellishments of Rumor.
The candidature of W. D. Flinn, the
socialistic Yarra. Bank orator, for the Federal
Convention, is ridiculed by both the Melb. dailies,
who have poked borak at the man until the public
has got to regard him as a cross between Billy
Maloney and the rnoSt blatant idiots of the Yarra
Bend Asylum. A.s a matter of fact, Flinn, despite
his association with the windbags of the city, is
a sensible, level-headed man, with a better general
education and a keener grasp of political subjects
than three-fourths of Vic. Assembly, and four-
fourths of the Council. He is a republican, an
Australian nationalist, a state socialist, but is
neither a teetotal nor W.C.T.U. crank. The
great objection to Flinn, as far as The Bulletin
can see, is that while he used to appear before the
public as William D. Flinn, he is now announced
as a Federal candidate as W. Dudley Flinn. At
this rate Dudley-Flinn, with a hyphen, is only a
matter of time.
Can Theosophy provide any explanation,
Karmic or otherwise, of the evil influence which
apparently attaches to the name Butler? Also,
why is it selected, criminally, in disproportion to
other names ? Some 30 years ago, in London, an
unholy vampire, who made a practice of waylaying
servant-girls after dark and murdering them on
the Burke and Hare principle, christened himself
Butler without baptismal warrant. Dr. Palmer,
of poisonous memory, once signed himself “ But-
ler ”in a hotel register. A notable American mur-
derer of a few years back was run to earth through
representing himself to be a certain J. Butler,
who, unknown to him, happened to be “ wanted ”
at the very time for embezzlement. The Bow-st.
police-cases for December last include no fewer
than four Butlers, two of them aliases, and one
with 38 previous convictions recorded against him !
Taking into consideration our own housebreaking
and corpse-prospecting Butlers, it is perhaps pre-
ferable to be known as Jones these times.
Kipling backs down several times in his
“ Seven Seas,” the nasty remarks in the verses as
originally published being carefully eliminated
from the collection. The most striking instance
is in the “Song of the English,” in the version of
which recited at the Himperial Hinstitoot
Quebec says:—
From my grey scarp I watch with scornful eyes
Ignobie broil of Freedom most unfree.
Fear nothing, mother, where the carcase lies
The Unclean Bird must be.
This most insulting reference to Yankeeland is
knocked out entirely in the book, and there is
substituted a verse marked “ Quebec and Mont-
real,” viz. :
Peace is our portion. Yet a whisper rose
Foolish and causeless, half in jest, half hate.
For wake we and remember mighty blows,
And, fearing no man, wait 1
Which means nothing in particular. Kipling is
like a lot of men who talk fight largely. When
the trouble starts they are wanting.

Apropos Q. Premier “ Nevermind” Nelson.
When Morrah was permanent head of Vic. Lands
and Works, all awkward deputations used to be
fixed for days when the Cabinet head would be
absent, and Morrah faced the music with a stereo-
typed “ I will see, gentlemen, that the matter re-
ceives the full consideration that is undoubtedly
due to it.” It became so aggravating that at last
a deputatic nist said : “ Your name’s Morrah, I
believe ; yo I’d better change it to To-Morrah ! ”

HORSE-HUNTER: “ Did you notice a grey horse about here, John?”

Myenberg, of Mt. Morgan fame, has just
died at Rockhampton (Q.). He was the first man
to take out a miner’s right in Q., and the first to
erect a battery. The old man always considered
he was entitled to a share in the original Mt.
Morgan claim, and fought it out at law to his
ultimate ruin. The decision meant millions to the
syndicate, and the result ruined four Queensland
men of note. Outsiders always considered that
Myenberg had a just claim to a fortune, but he
died in poverty.
It is related that some years ago John
Hay, driving on a N.S.W. country road, was
blocked by a teamster—“ You don’t know who I
am, my good man,” said John, “ I am Sir
John Hay, Knight.’' The teamster kept on. “ I
don’t give a damn who you are—l’m Flash Jack
of Bathurst to-night, to-morrow night, and the
night after.”
Queensland’s hangman is a burly, grey-
mutton-chop-whiskered old Englishman of the
class that clings fondly to the woollen-wrapper in
winter. His good, broad back is stooped a trifle,
but he carries the weight of 60 years with un-
common spryness—as, somehow or other, hang-
men mostly do. Not long since the gaol officials,
having some “cat” work on hand, sized him up
and, noticing that his arms through lack of play
began to wear a flabby look, decided that a
younger man ought to be sent for. The wily
slayer, however, got wind of the conspiracy, went
at once into retirement with an assortment of
clubs and dumb-bells, and afterwards gave a
couple of garotters such “a father of a cutting”
that his fame was established in the prison for all
time. He receives a retainer of <£l2s a year
with a capitation allowance of a guinea for
hangings, and still is not happy. No fewer
than seven subjects marked by the Judges for
slaughter have been reprieved lately by the Gover-
nor in Council, and thus, besides forfeiting the
moral solace which must accompany the exercise
of his art, the old gentleman has been a financial
loser to the extent of seven guineas.
Writes a Bulletin correspondent :
An adventurous and earnest Pole named Kosciuski
lately arrived in N.S.W. with a scheme for a flying-
machine, and has unobtrusively set about making it on
the shore of Lake Macquarie, where he is camped for the
purpose. By profession he is a master-mariner, and he
came out as mate in the ship King Arthur. For years he
has, like other sailors, watched with scientific apprecia-
tion the seemingly effortless perfection of the albatross’s
sailing-gear, which he believes he can produce in a con-
cern built of bamboo rods and silk, worked with pulleys,
guys and stays in nautical fashion that will compel pro-
pulsion in any required direction provided there is a
breeze on hand. A centra! frame or body—as of a bird—
has been made, 10ft. long and sft. wide. Sprouting out
of this are two wings, each 20ft. long, tapering to a point
from a width of 4ft. A forked tail set latitudinally,
platypus fashion, is cunningly devised as a rudder.
Each fork of the tail can be moved up or down or
otherwise according to varying conditions. Kosciuski
will occupy a saddle like that of a bike, his head only
appearing above the frame. By depressing his feet the
wings will be raised ; they will fall without manipulation.
Some three weeks have been occupied in making the
machine, and it is just about ready for trial. When ready
the inventor will take a header with it from a neighboring
cliff. As showing the self-containedness of the man he
declined solid financial aid in America, and crept into
his hidden location to work out the scheme alone, almost
without financial means. Beyond a saw and a jack-knife
he is not known to have had any tool-.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The chronic insolvency of Australian poli-
ticians—M. P. ouniosity.
“ Federation is to block out the Republic
with cast-iron precautions.”— Dudley Flinn.
The voting at the Federal Council showed
that there is a tacitly-understood defensive alli-
ance between Kanakaland and Westralia.
Hoolan, M.L.A. : “In 1893 the Labor-
party were accused of trying to break the Q.N.
Bank, and now that institution looks as if it
would break the Labor-party.” The split over the
bills certainly emphasised the possibility.
Cook, M.L.A., Victorian president of the
Natives’ Association, frankly tells his constituents
he has “lived to see the folly of having pledged
himself to support a reduction in the number and
the payment of members of the Leg. Assembly.”
Instead of sneering at ‘ ‘ democrats, with a
big D ” on every possible occasion, Sydney Daily
Telegraph should concentrate its intellect on
pointing out the difference between the Reid
variety of Freetrade and the common or garden
sort of Protection.
There are now two N.S.W. Federal Con-
vention candidates named Abbott—big Joe Abbott
and his brother, W. E. Abbott, the strike-and-
letter-writing bore. “There are two pests in
N.S.W.—the rabbit-pest and the Abbott-pest,”
said Abigail on an immortal occasion.
Cardinal Moran’s Federation candidature
is not the first move of the kind in these parts.
Some years back, Bishop Moran, of Dunedin,
fighting the everlasting education-question battle,
put up for a seat in Maoriland Parliament, but
apparently had no show of getting in, and with-
drew
Australia’s love of England is entirely
selfish. It is all what is to be done for us. The
sheltering fegis of the shadow of the wing of
England. Let there be a bit of a pinch—England
calling for help, the time come for us to put our
hands in our pockets and furnish ironclads and
troops for service abroad. Then —no fear.
Unreported question asked at R. E. O’Con-
nor’s Federal meeting at Narrabri : “ Would you
be in favor of the iaw officers of the Federal
Executive accepting briefs from persons sueing
the Government in courts of law ? ” Candidate :
“ I consider this question a personal insult aimed
at myself, and I therefore decline to answer it.”
Naturally, the Tory Brisbane papers, that
whooped for the Nelson Govt, in everything that
it did to “save the Q.N. Bank,” are hounding
down that same Govt, because it proposes to spend
JGISOO to bring back to Queensland 10 destitute
men, .With their 10 wives and 40 children, from
Paraguay —about the only decently generous
action which the Nelson Govt, has performed.
Vic. Govt, employs Chows on its experi-
mental farm in the King River district, and when
howled at replies that it doesn’t employ them
much. The servant-girl’s excuse, “only a little
one.” The Government that poll-taxes Chows to
save the whites from their ruinous competition,
and then gives them work to the exclusion of
Europeans, is both ends and the barrel of an ass.
That quaint politician, Arthur Renwick,
of N.S.W., is of opinion that “as the railways
are such a valuable asset and had cost the colony
so much expense to build they should be reserved
for local management.” Apparently Arthur
Renwick actually thinks that “ the colony ” has
paid for its railways. So far they haven’t cost
N.S.W. anything to build (though the deficit in
the earnings has cost it something), and they have
cost the other provinces remarkably little.
Card. Moran announced himself a candi-
date for the Federal Convention last Friday, with
a platform of religion for a basis, Sydney for a
capital, no railway or fiscal federation at present,
and no injustice to be done to “ my own colony ”
—altogether as ass-like and parochial a platform
as anybody’s. Syd. Daily Telegraph was ready
next morning with a leader denouncing the eccle-
siastical candidature ; but S.M. Herald waited—
to make sure how the public cat would jump.
Q. Premier Nelson has roused the rage of
his political friends and of the Brisbane Tory
press by preaching (in effect) at the Federal
Council that the New Hebrides might go toSheol,
or to France. This attitude is dead against his
traditions, no matter how artfully he and his
colleagues may attempt to modify it, by asserting
that it was hypothetically hung upon an “ if ” — if
Great Britain wouldn’t take over the islands.
For Nelson is not only a creature of the
MTlwraith who tried to capture the whole of New
Guinea by a coup d’dtat, but he is a Scotch Pres-
byterian, and the Scotch Presbyterians have by
cocoa-nut ventures got “ the sword of the spirit ”
very deep into the carcase of the New Hebrides.
Rather than forfeit their half-million of
interprovincial tariff import revenue and replace
this by a property or land-tax, Westralia’s repre-
sentatives stand out of Federation.
The com-
bination of
the general
election and
the local op-
tion poll in
Maoriland led
to confusion
in some direc-
tions. The
war-cry of the
Prohibition-
is t s was
“ Strike out

This referred

reading that
“ the number

to that effect.

and sung;the
battle-cry of

peared on pos-
ters, pamph-
lets, tracts,

one fixed idea,
that it was to

promiscuously and on both ballot-papers, and if
the teetotal candidate happened to be on the top
line his prospect didn’t amount to a row of pins.
Gov. Buxton has returned to S.A. for a
week or two. His next trip will probably be to
England and America for two years. As a
travelling Governor, H.E. easily beats Kin tore,
who held the previous Australian record.
Trentham (Vic.) contains 340 people. At
a meeting of a portion of said population it was
decided to invite all the 32 Vic. Federal Conven-
tion candidates to visit Trentham and personally
place their views before the inhabitants of this
possible federal capital. It is understood that
candidates from other provinces will also be wel-
come.
A WOMAN'S USES .
HE (teased about sweethearts): “Em never going to get married . What's the good of a
wife?”
HIS THOUGHTFUL SISTER : “ But, then, if a burglar comes, who’ll hold him down while you
beat him?”
John Haynes, M.L.A., says that he is a
Federationist, but is against Federation as at
present proposed, because “N.S.W. will have
three votes to one against her in the Federal
Parliament.” (Each of the other provinces will
also have three votes to one against her, but that
fact doesn’t enter into John’s simple philosophy.)
Obviously, as John wants Federation, but doesn’t
want N.S.W. to have three votes to one against
her, his idea is that N.S.W. should have four
votes, and the other three provinces one each, or
something like that, and then the matter will be
settled quite simply.
Ex-Chief Justice Lilley (Q.) longs for the
flesh-pots of Egypt. Stated that he will take a
hand in a gathering of labor leaders at Longreach
in March.
Maoriland has got all that the chartists
fought for.
L. F. Heydon, Sydney’s vociferous lawyer,
writes denouncing N.S.W. Federationists in
general as traitors who are prepared to sell their
country for a prospective billet in the Federal
Parliament. Heydon also compares them hysteri-
cally to Bazaine arid Dreyfus, and generally asks
his country to beware of the men who want to
sell it for lucre. This naturally sets people
wondering if Heydon gets anything, present or
prospective, for running his little provincial
racket, and what he wants to sell his country to
the Sydney importers for, and how things stand
generally. The Bulletin wouldn’t have suspected
Heydon of being anything save a very dull and
narrow and ordinary person, but for his eagerness
to suspect everybody except Heydon.
Six Parliamentary candidates were chosen
by the Hobart Licensed Victuallers and their
names posted in the pubs, as candidates “ favor-
ing legislation in the interest of the trade.” A week
later the Council of Churches publicly announced
that the Godly should vote straight for three of the
same aspirants. Asked to explain the paradox a
prominent Church Council dignitary hinted that
the publicans had been “ had.” Bamboozled by
Chadband ? Rats ! Another parson, a virulent
cold-tea and anti-Tattersall apostle, admitted that
as many of his congregation held shares in the
Cascade brewery monopoly he had to temper the
heat of his discourses to the requirements of the
fat and woolly lambs. Which accounts for many
things.
The three ages of Australian Federation—
-1856, 1876, 1897. In the first, engineered by
Deas-Thomson, the general principle was laid
down, and N.S.W., Victoria, S. Australia, and
Tasmania named as the contracting parties.
These, so far as names go, are, after 40 years,
again the parties to the desired contract. In the
second age, Gov. Hercules Robinson oraturically
created a Federation ideal. His speech was prob-
ably the most widely effective of gubernatorial
utterances in Australia. He introduced Queens-
land and Westralia into the union, and for the
time being patriots saw a new national birth. But
politicians seized, fought over it, and strangled
the infant. Now, in ’97, the purpose has once
more sprung to vital existence, and—but there are
a lot of lawyers about the cradle.
A Bulletin correspondent who “ ought to
know ”:—
“Toby” Barton is wrong in asserting that N.S.W.
Premier Reid, when in Brisbane on his “ Federation mis-
sion,” was not told that anybody there was averse to it
until after he had quitted Q. territory. Reid knew all
f/om the start. What happened was this : The same train
that took Reid from Sydney carried also a press reporter
(two, but this par. concerns one only). Reid stayed at
Toowoomba on a Sunday en route ; the reporter went on
to Brisbane. On Monday, the rep. went round to pro-
minent Brisbane citizens merchants, manufacturers,
clubmen, politicians, etc. —and “sounded” them.
Whether he did this for Reid or his paper matters not.
On Monday evening Reid came on from Toowoomba
(where he had been Premier Nelson’s guest), and the rep.
made a confidential report to him, as thus: “No use
calling on A., 8., C., D., etc.); they’re dead against you;
try L., M., N., 0., etc. ; they are in favor of federation."
The “ mission ” was all readied up. Mr. Barton ought to
know that all such political missions are readied up. Reid
simply didn’t call on those who would have told him that
his “ mission” wasn’t palatable.
The great Q. political question is now,
Are you a Byrnesite or a Tozerite? Brisbane
Courier is coming out as a frank Tozerite.
Byrnes’s insufferable arrogance is one reason —
people won’t stand it; while Tozer is the most in-
gratiating person in politics. Call him a liar (a
political liar, of course); prove to him that he is a
liar ; and he will merely brush the accusation
aside as irrelevant and flood you with his ideas on
the question you have nearest your heart. Then
politician Byrnes is entirely under the priestly
thumb, and is believed to be pledged to re-establish
denominational ed,ucation if he gets half a chance
—and the Courier knows the’ majorityßeeling too
well to risk that. So it jeers at the Federal Coun-
cil which Byrnes upholds—calls it a picnic, and
points out that Byrnes’s and Nelson’s bombast
that “ Queensland thought ” the council all that is
required at present, was bombast merely; since
Queensland’s opinion has never been asked,
and Nelson and Byrnes have carefully shirked
asking it. “If the Federal Council is to sit in
Melb,” says the Courier, “let it be associated
with the Cup Carnival. And meanwhile, when
we want specific federal action, something with
‘ business ’ in it, let us ask Mr. TOZER to person-
ally conduct the necessary negotiations.”
The Election of Federal Convention dele-
gates is fixed for March 4, and The Bulletin pro-
poses before then to issue a Federal ticket for
N.S.W., Victoria, and S.A., and possibly for Tas-
mania also, if the sleepy candidates of that isle
only sort themselves out in time, and grow a little
more definite in their utterances. For each pro-
vince this paper will endeavor to suggest ten men
who are democratic, with clean records, patriotic
in the Australian, not merely the provincial, sense,
with sufficient brains to fix up a workable consti-
tution and sufficient business knowledge not to get
wrecked among the intricate financial matters which
have to be settled. So far as it has got with the
lists, it has had to strike out the names of some
good men—good in a general sense—because the
frantic absurdity of their demands on behalf of
their own particular province would have made
things hopeless from the start; and some more
because they showed such profound ignorance of
facts and figures that to entrust them with intri-
cate questions of finance looks about as absurd as
entrusting a bear with a theodolite. The Bulle-
tin’s Federal ticket will at least be as perfect as
this paper knows how to make it, and it respect-
fully requests all its readers to vote that ticket—
or as much of it as their consciences will allow.
It also suggests to all those people who
haven’t the time or the energy to read up the
innumerable speeches of the candidates, and
add up their sentiments and opinions, and draw
up a list for themselves, that they might as well
vote The Bulletin ticket as any other. And it
asks all electors to vote, whether they vote The
Bulletin ticket or not, if only for the sake of
showing that Federation is a live question and not
a mere remains. The Bulletin ticket isn’t a
party one in particular it is absolutely independ-
ent of the “ fiscal issue also, it isn’t a list of the
men whom this paper thinks will get in but of
those who, in its opinion, ought to get in—which
is quite a different matter.


Notwithstanding the general
during the past year, the inevitable aceompani'
ment of a Presidential election, the Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the United States has
completed a, remarkable year’s business. The
result is the increase of the: society’s assets by the
very large sum of £3,284,283, making a total of
<£45,161,239, equivalent to 125 per cent, of the
total liabilities of the society ; an increase of over
half a million sterling in the amount of assurances
in force, which now reach the enormous aggregate
of <£190,646,265 ; and the surplus, which for many
years has been larger than that of any other life
officeJn the world, has been still further increased
by -£552,774, and now stands at nearly nine mil-
lions sterling. This surplus may be regarded as
not only a guarantee of future bonuses but also
relied upon by policy-holders as a safeguard
against the remote and unknown contingencies of
the future.*
A thing which is always worth noting is a
good brand of tobacco, therefore “ Two Seas ” is
especially worthy of note because it is excellent.
The smoker who has not tried this brand is behind
the times in his own profession ; he is missing real
enjoyment and trying to content himself with a
substitute. “Two Seas’’has taken many hand-
some gold medals —the last big Exhibition at
Chicago added one more to the list. The fact of
these gold medals is not offered as the encourage-
ment to the public, because the public cannot
smoke gold medals. The real “ all gold ” is the
tobacco itself—aromatic, light or dark. Nobody
ever remembered “ Two Seas ” for the purpose of
ever afterwards avoiding it, nor does any fond
father give it to his boy in order to break the boy
of smoking. But it comes as a boon to all—-to
those who always get it, and to those who resolve
on reading this paragraph to give it an honest
trial.*

“ The Last of Six.”
Victoria, which has been rather short of a
decent horror of late, has now got one which com-
pletely “lays over” Butler, and can give points
even to Deeming. A few weeks ago one Lyfield was
arrested on a charge of having butchered his wife
then left her body for a few days in an outhouse
(where his daughter and granddaughter looked in
casually at intervals and noted, in a mild, unin-
terested way, the presence of “ mother ” on top of
a heap of sacks), and finally sunk her in the river.
The most interesting feature of the case was the
dull, stolid, agricultural indifference with which
the two women acknowledged, after Lyfield’s
arrest, that they heard “mother ” being killed in
the next room, and that for days afterwards they
kept dropping on the body of “mother” in unex-
pected places, and finally one night they heard
“mother” being hauled away for burial, and
after that didn’t come across her body in
outhouses any more. Since then the two women
have made further revelations, and in their own
slow way they have built up a squalid, shuddery
horror which has few equals in Australia. The
daughter, aged 43, says that she was seduced by
her father as far back as she can remember, and
that there had been “ relations ” between them for
over 30 years. Two children were born, ac-
cording to this dank and mouldy chronicle, and
the man who was their combined father and
grandfather killed them and buried them on
the farm. The third one—a daughter—was
allowed to grow up. Then the mother and
her infant were both passed on to one
Snell, who married the former, partly because
he also had “ relations ” with her, and
partly, it would seem, because the old man pro-
mised him a part of the farm. After six years
Snell somehow dropped out of the hideous narra-
tive, and his wife and her daughter went back to
their old quarters. Then the agricultural house-
father renewed his “relations” with his daughter,
and also started immoral relations with his grand-
daughter-then aged six. Old Lyfield was mar-
ried again by this time, and so he and two women
and a girl led their soulful existence together in
one house for seven years. At the end of that
time the complaints and objections of “ mother ”
led—so the daughter and grand-daughter allege
to her butchery in the next room. There-
fore old Lyfield, aged 70, is in gaol await-
ing trial. His daughter, aged 43, and de-
scribed as a little, hard, lean, wrinkled
expressionless being of no intelligence worth men-
tioning, and the grand-daughter, wooden and aged
13, are waiting around to explain about the body
of “mother” and other matters when the case
comes on. And “ mother ” herself is well clear of
the trouble, and seems more to be congratulated
than anybody else in the story, except, possibly,
Snell, who dropped out so judiciously seven years
ago. The only redeeming feature in the case is
that Lyfield and his daughter both date back to
the days of religious education and were brought
up under the Bible-in-schools policy, and, if their
morals aren’t so beautifully clean as they might
be, the “ godless system of education ” can’t be
saddled with the blame this time.
The strongest piece of circumstantial evi-
dence in the Glenbrook case comes from Captain
Frazer, of the Swanhilda, who states that Butler
was the most pious sailor he had on board. Didn’t
The Bulletin say a week or two ago that he
would probably turn out to be an ex-Sunday-school
superintendent ?
The Q. International Exhibition is born.
It will be a big thing and a little thing. It will
be a success and a non-success. The Brisbane
apathy about it is marvellous. Brisbanites are
the most narcotised business men of Australia.
Time is of no value in the city, whose inhabitants
have for years been hypnotised by a bank, pap-fed
by Govt. The Exhibition may be a success as an
international show ; as a local show, it must be a
dead-sea of dreariness. Brisbane people only
believe in it in the same dreamy fashion that they
believe in Gabriel’s resurrection trumpet.
The old story of the tramp who considered
liquor poor stuff indeed if the drops that fell from
his beard upon his shirt did not burn holes in it,
was recalled in Brisbane City Court the other day.
It appears that while Gabriel (of Mount Morgan
gold-stealing detection and other fame), who has
been sleuth-hounding among the sly-groggeries,
was “ wrestling with a barman to get a flask of
broken-down brandy ” a portion of the liquor spilt
on his coat-sleeve and slurt-cuffs. Next morning
he found holes in said coat-sleeves and shirt-cuffs
wherever the liquor had touched. (Shirt and
coat produced and tendered ; received and marked
as evidence.)


Mr, Thomas Jarvis 9 Step-brother
Interviewed.
HIS VIEWS OF HIS BROTHER’S SUP-
POSED HOPELESS CASE (PARTICU-
LARS OE WHICH APPEARED A
WEEK OR SO AOO IN THIS PAPER.)
WHAT MR. DONOHUE SAYS.
In order to obtain further confirmation of the
Cure wrought by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People (in the ease of Mr. Thos. Jarvis, of 45
Crown-lane, Ultimo, Sydney, who had been told
by the doctors he was incurable), our representa-
tive interviewed Mr. James Donohue, a step-
brother of the patient. Mr. Donohue was dis-
covered hard at work in the boiler of a locomotive
at the Eveleigh Railway workshops. Few men are
better known in trade-union circles than “ Jim ”
Donohue. He is a member of the Iron Trades
Council and is the representative of the Boiler-
makers’ Society. He is the secretary of the rep-
resentative committee of the Eveleigh Railway
workshops. He has always taken the deepest
interest in trades matters, and was secretary for
several years of the Boilermakers’ Society of
N.S.W. He has held responsible positions in Vic-
toria, having been the representative of the Bal-
larat Boilermakers’ Society at the Trades Union
Congress held in Melbourne in April, 1884. He
was also representative of the Melbourne Boiler-
makers’ Society on several occasions in matters
between the Society and employers. He occupied
most intelligently similar positions in Newcastle
and Sydney. Twenty years ago he was a pro-
minent member of the Boilermakers’ Society of
California, and was Chairman of that Society at
San Francisco. The testimony of such a well-
known and representative trade unionist will
speak for itself.
“ Yes,” he said, “ I am a step-brother of Thomas
Jarvis, who is now 35. He is a boilermaker and
was employed at various workshops, and was for
some time with the Colonial Sugar Company at
Fiji. He met with an accident five years ago at
the swimming baths in Pitt street, Sydney. He
was severely scalded about the legs through falling
over an exposed steam pipe. He was bad for
months, but seemed to get alright, but this com-
plaint, which is a conundrum—l fancy it is a form
of paralysis—developed. After the accident he
worked for a considerable time at Glebe Island
abattoirs, and gradually grew worse, ultimately
losing the use of his legs. That occurred two
months ago. The doctors who attended him con-
sidered the
CASE HOPELESS
and reckoned all they could do for him would be
to relieve the torture he was enduring. He was
thus treated with no idea of effecting any cure.
More as an experiment than otherwise, Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People were tried. He
took a box a week and the effect has been marvel-
lous He became better rapidly, and is now using
the fifth box.
I NEVER SAW SUCH A CHANGE
in a man. I didn’t believe in patent medicines as
rule, but have so altered my opinion that I am
recommending Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to all
sufferers of my acquaintance. I may mention
that my daughter, Mrs. Thomas O’Toole, of
Darling-street, Balmain, who has been suffering
from debility, is using these Pills and deriving
great benefit. She was induced to take them
owing to their wonderful efficacy in Tom’s case.
Tom Jarvis expects to be able to
GO TO WORK
in a short time, and he does not want to have
much the matter with him physically to follow
the occupation of a boilermaker. Very naturally,
Tom’s cure has caused quite a sensation among the
boilermakers, and they can hardly credit the
news.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured more than
five thousand cases, besides Mr. Jarvis, of loco-
motor ataxia, nervous exhaustion, rheumatism,
sciatica, muscular weakness, depression, loss of
appetite, palpitation of the heart, headache, early
decay, paralysis, and locomotor ataxy; also all
diseases arising from impoverished and vitiated
blood, such as scrofula, .rickets, St. Vitus dance,
and chronic erysipelas, pale and sallow complexion,
anaemia, wasting diseases like consumption, and
the ailments of ladies. These pills are not a pur-
gative medicine. They contain nothing that will
injure the most delicate system. They are sold by
chemists, or sent (post paid) by Dr. Williams’
Medicine Company, Sydney, on receipt of price in
stamps or post order, 2s. 9d. per box, or 14s. 9d.
per one half-dozen.*
Election Notices.
TO THE ELECTORS OF NEW SOUTH
WALES.
Gentlemen, —In view of the Federal Election
I beg leave to offer myself as a candidate. I
want neither pay nor honors, my hope being that
I may serve my native country at a time when
assistance may be needed. Guided by addresses
and speeches so far, it is not easy to know what is
meant; the scheme promises well for our neigh-
bors. But what advantages are we to derive?
We have the finest country in the world (no empty
boast), and with better government we ought to
do well enough as we are ; still, Federation is de-
sirable, and Queensland, no doubt, would join if
any show of reason presented itself ; but let us
take care we are not to be placed at any dis-
advantage. All sorts of wild schemes and wild
talk will go on, to the confusion of our electors,
and it would be well if many of our politicians
especially could be eliminated for a time, so that
some fair play might be attempted. I appeal to
the thousands of our producers who now deal with
my firm, and to our workers, with whom I have
always sympathised; I can refer to all who have
worked for me. I have worked hard enough my :
self, and my experiences of New South Wales
extend from farming pursuits to the successful
management of one of the largest mercantile busi-
nesses in Australia.
I can also boast of some knowledge of Federa-
tion, both ancient and modern, and promise our
electors that if favored with their choice to devote
my best abilities to their welfare.
Yours sincerely,
JOHN BRIDGE.

—THE—
Most Useful Ointment in the World!
Bar 3NT one.
PREMIER OINTMENT in the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an article as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
theproduetionof thecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you’
Read this letter and Try eor Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.
1 remain, yours, etc.,
L. P. SOLOMONS, Herald Office.
BAD LEGS, OLD SORES of long standing
have been cured by using this Ointment.
SORE EYES, or Sandy Blight.—There is
nothing known to man eoual to JOSEPHSONS
AUSTRALIAN OINTMENT.
Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any otner medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelaide, October 30, 1886.
Baron Berzilius’— —
=——Buchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
These Bitters I recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. :—The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D. —It is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows:
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to al
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
I eetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Sydney Truth has reduced N.S.W. libel-
law to its lowest terms —which are pretty low.
You can sue Truth civilly for libel, as Seymour
Allen did, and get a verdict for £ 1000 damages,
but you can’t get the cash ; and in bailiff-fees, and
revilings, and general unpleasantness, the verdict
costs you far more than the cash is worth. Or
you can sue Truth’s editor criminally, and then
John Norton gets his chance to orate before a jury
—and he orates well—on that popular topic, the
Freedom of the Press. He has only to convince
one man that no matter what an editor writes, it is
bad, on general principles, to gaol him—a pretty
easy matter —and he leaves the Court two inches
taller. Or he can appeal to the jury’s prejudices
—to their Orangeism if the prosecutor is a Holy
Roman, to their Holy Romanism if the prosecutor
is an Orangeman ; he can appeal to their nation-
ality, to their politics, and—if there’s anything at
all of a proof that he was actuated by public
motives, or even if there isn’t —free he goes. Be-
sides, the double-barrelled libel-law defeats itself.
Prosecuted civilly, John Norton can say : “ Bah !
he doesn’t want to clear his character—he wants
cash.” Prosecuted criminally, it is : “ See !he is
actuated by personal animosity ; he wants ven-
geance ; he doesn’t want to clear his character, or
he would have sued civilly.” Pedestal Truth
and John Nortonas theN.S.W. libel-law reformers,
for they undoubtedly are ! Last Sunday’s issue of
Truth contained two soul-stirring articles, one
about Dibbs and one about somebody else, and
such blasphemy arose that a fog hung over Sydney
all day Monday, but John Norton’s cheerful
countenance glowed through the haze unabashed,
triumphantly. Has he not reformed the N.S.W.
libel-law ?
He Don’t Deny It.
It is not always that people, either socially, com-
mercially, or politically prominent, will boldly
proclaim the author of their happiness, but W. H.
Steadman, Esq., J.P., of Balmain, Sydney,
N.S.W., says, writing on the 26th Nov., 1896 :
“ Warner,s Safe Cure Co. Gentlemen : You will
please pardon me for the liberty I take in thus
communicating with you, never having seen any
member of your firm, but I so much desire to record
my high approbation of the wonderfully meritorious
and curative qualities of your marvellous prepara-
tion— ‘ Warner’s Safe Cure’—and to contribute
my heartfelt testimony to the efficacy of its use, and
to add my humble voice to the grand paean of praise
continually chanted in its favour. I was severely
afflicted with liver and kidney troubles for some
years, but on the advice of several friends in
different parts of the colony, I was induced, after
having been treated by two or three eminently clever
medical men, to try this glorious remedy, with the
most satisfactory results ; and, to-day, I would
earnestly recommend its adoption to all persons
who may be suffering from any form of liver or
kidney affection, with the sure and certain hope of
speedy and permanent recovery. I do not know
that this is of any service to you, but in the in-
terests of suffering humanity, I should be pleased
if you would make this public. I am, sir, yours
faithfully, W. H. Steadman, J.P.”*

M. A. Noble, the N.S.W. colt, began interpro-
vincial cricket two years ago by failing in both innings.
To-day he is batting far above what would seem to be his
true form; scoring 71 and 153 not out against Vic., and
last Saturday week 166f0r Paddington against Glebe. His
club average last season was 25 ; this season it was 50
before his 166 score ; his interprovincial average is almost
70. He is 24 years old, and near 6ft. high ; one of a family
of cricketers, he knew the use of bat and ball almost as
soon as he learnt the use of his legs. The man who has
given him most coaching is the prince of soporific bats-
men, Alec Bannerrnan, the small, stern, sad, sleepful
stonewaller. Noble mostly accepted Bannerman’s advice
to disobey it; when told to stonewall he hit and became
a brilliant batsman instead of a baleful blocker. Aus-
tralia wants batsmen who can give the crowd a good go
for its money ; and Noble’s go in both innings was the
best treat the Sydney crowd had in the recent interesting
match. The few times that Noble showed any hesitancy
was when slow, high-tossed ones leaving the hand of
Trott lost themselves momentarily through being in line
with the dark-green foliage of a large fig-tree that grows
outside the fence.
* * * *
Adelaide cricket writers attribute the wretched
fielding of the S.A. eleven to net-practice, and advocate
its abolition. There is some truth in the argument that
it takes constant practice to accept chances in the slips off
a fast bowler like Jones. At the start of the English tour
accomplished fieldsmen like Trumble and Giffen dropped
Jonah wholesale ; in fact, the deposition of George Giffen
from the slips caused some trouble on one occasion.

Scene : Sydney cable-tram. Passengers include
youth, straw-hatted, with incipient moustache and bright
yellow shoes, reading sporting paper. Beside him two
Frenchmen jabber in undertone to one another, then—
First Frenchman (turns to youth): “ Tell me, my frien’
—vat ees it, thees Noble now—how mooch he make ? ”
Youth (looks up from paper and surveys Frenchman
critically) : “ A hundred fifty-tree.”
Second Frenchman enthusiastically (throws up his
hands): “ Mon Dieu! He throw one ’ondred fifty-
tree bowls ? Eh ? (turns to his friend.)
First Frenchman (in explanatory tone) : “ No, mussier,
he got one ’ondred and fifty-three legs befor’ wicket.
(Goes into ecstacies.) Magnifique ! Superbe ! One
’ondred and fifty-tree legs befo’ week-ed ! ” (Turns to
friend and explains situation to him confidentially.)
Tram stops. Youth gets out, glances back at French-
men and grins. Tram starts again—first Frenchman still
explaining to companion.
Left explaining.

There is much jealousy in Adelaide over the
fact that the Exhibition Oval, recently laid out by Govt.,
is used for the cycling meetings, much to the financial
loss of the S.A. Cricketing Association, which formerly
had a monopoly with Adelaide Oval. The jubilee cycling
track is supposed to be the fastest in Australia.

The prospects of the Australasian ’chasers in
England are probably much brighter than the market
odds would lead uninitiated punters to suppose. Norton,
the big Maorilander, has been let into the Liverpool Grand
National at a luxurious weight, whilst Ebor, on his recent
improved form over big jumps, is handicapped within a
few pounds of Daimio, whose Australian reputation is
represented by 12T0. If Ebor be reasonably treated on
his English running, Daimio, according to Australian
reckoning, has a splendid chance of winning the big
event. In any case, the Gibson Bros.’ champion, fit and
well at Liverpool, will test the relative merits of Austra-
lian and English jumpers. Here he would rank as a
“ good thing” for Flemington G.N. Steeplechase at any-
thing less than 13st., therefore his owners can’t grumble
at the Liverpool handicapping without withdrawing their
former opinion that Daimio was equal to the best cross-
country racers at ’Ome.

The art students of Victoria complain bitterly of
neglect at the late A.N.A. fSte, when £625 were given as
prizes in bicycle races, whereas under £4O was awarded
in the 13 art sections, embodying 300 exhibits. They
seem to think that art ought to have as good a show as
athletics, and don’t feel comforted when reminded that
no prizes were awarded in the department of the noble
science of self-defence —one of the greatest refining and
civilising influences known to human nature.

The Australian Fair sports, held on Sydney
Agricultural Ground last Saturday, represented the latest
attempt of Sydney’s R C. residents to raise funds for the
building of St. Mary’s Cathedral. All the Bhoys were
there —including the Cardinal, Bishop Higgins—and that
Scotch haythen, Quong Tart. Everybody called everyone
else Dhanny or Micky, and altogether the affair was a
birthday for Ould Oireland.
The sports, as a whole, were flat and wearisome.
Exceptions were Roseingrave’s brilliant hurdle-racing and
the finish of the ten-mile League Cycling test-race. Here
M‘Coombe beat Meadham by a most gamely-sustained
spurt home. M'Coombe, therefore, will represent the
N.S.W. League in Adelaide, and a pluckier or more
honest performer couldn’t be picked.
The event of the day was the tug-of-war—lre-
land v. English men-of-warsmen. “Ireland” consisted
of massive men heaven-born policemen. Compared
with the English they were a team of selected draught
stallions ; the English were a scratch lot with two or
three ponies. The fun began the moment the referee
called “Go!” The contestants lay back, grafted like
devils, and screwed their faces into curiosities of ugliness.
The strain on the rope was terrific, but it was nothing to
the strain on the supporters of the Ould Dart. Some of
these flew up and down and around their team ; the
policemen’s feet tore the grass away in strips and threw
up clouds of dust. The yells were ear-splitting: “Howld
iviry blankv inch uv it! Bury thim blanky feet!
Maloney, dig in thim blanky heels ! Maloney, tak off yer
boots and spit on yer feet! Shut yer blanky rat-trap !
Howld on to it, Dinny ! To hell wid ye ! Tak that point
for protest! Get a blank.v foot-holt! I can’t shtand it! ”
Encouraged by these yells, Ireland pulled enough to pull
the ould sod out of purgatory, and the poor, miserable,
busted English collapsed from sheer exhaustion.

If Newhaven goes ’Ome, which is now an un-
likely thing to happen, Walter Hickenbotham will not
accompany the horse.
Some of the tales re non-payment of jockey-fees
are almost pathetic. The other day, in a train returning
to Melb. from a suburban mee'ing, a wan and weary light-
weight was heard to ask a pigmy companion whether he
intended to have tea in town. “ I can’t slake," said the
youngster ruefully, whereupon the first boy remarked :
“ And yet you had three rides ! ” Here was a case of a
jockey in a seemingly prosperous way of business who
had had three mounts during the afternoon, not being
able to put down a “ bob ” for his tea in town.

Totalisator divs. at the Hobart meeting proved
to be poor as a rule. The machine was run “ blind,” but
the owners, who expected to benefit by the public’s
ignorance as to how the big money was being invested,
will probably prefer to have the blind up for the future.
When punters punt in the dark the money is not likely to
be well-distributed. Not being able to see an inducement
to back one or other of the unfancied ones for the sake of
long odds, they put their money on the popular fancy,
with the hope that it may not be carrying an excessive
burden of tickets. If a very rank-outsider gets home the
two or three lucky investors are pretty certain to be
friends or agents of the tote management, who get private
information concerning the state of the betting ballot
just before the tote closes. Under the “blind” system
the men who work the machines ought to die rich.
They are the only people on the course who possess the
knowledge which should be common property, and which
is common property elsewhere than at tricky little Tassy.

Editor Bulletin, — Sir : Let me express my sur-
prise and indignation at the contents of a paragraph
which recently appeared in your sporting columns. I
consider that your contributor’s remarks on the un-
sportsmanlike acts of the members of the N.S.W.
Gun Club, and the insinuations as to their living on the
game are unwarrantable in any paper ; and, in justice to
those members, I cannot allow them to remain unnoticed.
It is generally thought in sporting circles (and' some of
my friends are not slow in affirming) that the paragraph
alluded to was either written by me or inserted at my
instigation. It is for the purpose of contradicting these
reports and removing this erroneous impression, and last,
but by no means least of all, of removing the slur that has
been unwarrantably cast upon the members of the N.S.W.
Gun Club, that I ask you to publish this letter. —Yours,
A. W. Eales. Sydney, January 15th, 1897.
[The paragraph of which Mr. Eales complains
was not written or instigated by him ; the only state-
ment in it regarding Mr. Eales is that he is a mere
amateur who does not live cm the game. The paragraph
is fact ; it makes’no alluSbn whatever to the members of
the N.S.W. Gun Club as a body ; the writer was well aware
that the members in general are too bad shots to live on
the game. Every sport has its few foxes and many
geese. A full, true and particular history of the unhappy
geese who have been plucked on the Sydney Gun Club
grounds would make sensational reading.— Ed. B.]

Rumor hath it that Mr. Cooper wishes to sell
Newhaven. This is not at all unlikely, as besides the
risks connected with the horse’s transport to England,
he would be hard to trade off when there owing to the
doubts about his pedigree.

The Sydney punter still patronises the five-bob

N.S.W. will be well represented at Melb. during

In the Oakleigh Plate, to-day, Metford (Carbine
—Marchesa) should prevail. He will probably have most
to fear from his compatriots, Akarini and San Marco. In
the Oakleigh Purse, Danube should make a big show.

That rogue, Duhallow, who started a warm
favorite for Caulfield Cup, has been relegated to hurdle-
racing, and won his first race over sticks at Melbourne on
Saturday. This new departure may give him courage;
if so, he will yet show his undoubted pace on the flat.

Pharamond found the distance too far for him
in Hobart Cup; he, however, afterwards won the Lord

With the bestof Australian jockeys eitner having
left the country or “ standing down,” the butcher-boy
type is having a high old time. ’Tis a pitiable sight to
see these manikins lamm their wretched mounts at the
finish of a race—chance or no chance ; but what can be
expected when the leading clubs in Australia command
that all horses must be ridden out in a race ?
• * * *
When the cricket-match between members of
N.S.W. and Vic. Parliaments was played in Melbourne
recently, a spectator said to a prominent cricketer who
was also watching the game : “ Don’t you think any
average cricketer would make as good a member of Par-
liament as any of those fellows?” “My oath!” re-
marked the P.C. “ Well, how is it that they play such
poor cricket?” enquired the other. “That’s a different
thing,” replied the P.O, gravel}'; “ to play cricket pro-
perly a man must have brains, and judgment, and train-
ing.”
• * * *
Only a few years ago, a certain clever crowd, at
Caulfield, took £20,000 out of the ring over a Newmarket,
and yet their horse started at 40 to 1. Now, if a horse
were backed to win as many pence, he would be imme-
diately installed a hot first favorite ; such is the state of
the much-vaunted ’Stralian betting-ring.
* * * *
It is rather a forlorn hope to “ ring in ” a trotter
in any of the Australias now, but there is one horse
running about Sydney that the “ talent ” cannot place.
His educated style of going shows him to be no beginner
at the game.
• * * •
The greatest trotting take-down Australia ever
saw was undoubtedly old Commodore. No Yankee cari-
cature could outdo the horse in his latter days. A bag of
bones, bowed at the knees, teeth inches long, and with a
chronic hacking cough, old Com. was rung-iri at Brisbane
some years ago as Jack, and driven onto the course in an
old, broken-down sulky, with string-tied harness. “ Here,
old man,” said one of the gang in the swim, “I’ll lend you
a sulky for the race,” and another offered a set of harness.
But the good thing did not meet with the success it
deserved. George Donaldson happened to be in Brisbane
with Garryowen at the time, and, at once recognising
Commodore, gave the show away, and the old horse and
the clever crowd were warned off for good. They got the
totalisator money, but the stakes went to second horse.
What indomitable pluck the horse had ! He would shuffle
along until the reins were gathered up and a hold taken,
when age and infirmity were forgotten, and he would “do
or diz.”

“About ten years ago, while en-

between the rails, and my leg was
fractured below the knee. It healed
in time, but I have been troubled
ever since with swollen veins, and
have been obliged, at times, to wear
a bandage. About a year ago it be-
came much worse, and I feared I
should be obliged to give up my
work. A friend advised me to try
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I did so, and
after taking four bottles the swell-

At Hobart. Johnny Bounder, just ar-
rived, to sullen-looking native holding up a tele-
graph-post : “ Aw —I say—you dawn’t knaw
where Dr. Bones lives ? ” The native wasn’t
having any. “Don’t I?” he said carelessly.
“But—aw —do you know?” continued the dis-
gusted “Nicest.” “That’s my business,” said
the native. “But I want to knaw—yer knaw.”
“ Well, that’s your business.” Then the eye-
glassed one stood on his outraged dignity: “You
are vewy wude. I will—aw—have to awsk some
one else.” “ All right ; that’s some one else’s
business.”
The alteration in the running of the Bris-
bane mail, whereby the train reaches Sydney at
11 a.m. instead of 11 p.m., is doubtless a conveni-
ence to Northern travellers, but Sydney people
affected by the change do not like it. To begin
with, two of the city postal deliveries have been
altered, the 11 a.m. and 1.30 p.m. being the cause
of much cursing amongst postmen, as they have
no opportunity to get lunch until close on 3 p.m.
Also, instead of finishing on Saturday after their
11.30 run as formerly they have to deliver the
Brisbane mail at 1.30, and that at a time when
almost all the business houses are closed, conse-
quently the letters are nearly all brought back to
the office. Clerks and others in city houses have
also to hustle, as letters delivered at 1.30 have to
be answered almost immediately to catch the re-
turning mail. Goods likewise have to be des-
patched at high pressure and short notice.
Writes “6x8”: I knew her 20 minutes
when she confidentially asked the loan of my ear.
She was a native, and “my man” an Irish ex-
policeman who kept the Bullock-Team Inn. ‘ ‘ He’s
an awful beast,” she whispered, “ when he’s drink-
ing. He burst out before Xmas and you’d hardly
believe how hard I tried, for the sake of the chil-
dren, to get him off it before our holiday supply of
grog arrived. First I put three bottles of brandy
and four sticks of tobacco into the beer-cask.
That didn’t stop him. He drank it all and started
on the spirits. So I puts all the schnapps and
bitters and a handful of mustard and cayenne-
pepper into the keg of overproof rum ; while Maud
put a mixture of vinegar, turpentine, and baking-
soda into the gin-jar. We thought that ’d pull
him up. But it had no effect—he drank ev’ry
drop ! There was only whisky left then, so we
puts three packets of Epsom salts and a strong
dose of jalap into each bottle. That made him
feel a bit queer, but he drank it all the same and
went across the road to the other pub. But he
soon came back. Their grog beat him. He’s
sober now. God knows for how long. It’s awful
the way he robs me and the children.”

A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W. A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common?” Ihe
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. r l here is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

Mr. Button writes later:—"The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies."
A Lady’s Testimonial.

Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmtjssen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medioines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,

It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to

The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble

him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-

lian Press: —
Sydney Bulletin. —“Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has

colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-

mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.”
Chemist and Brnggist Journal, Melbourne.—
“Herr Rassmussen has opened a branch depdt at 150

Evening Jonrnal, Adelaide. —“Herr Rassmussen

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RABIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

Item from the report of Wells, leader of a
party which went out in search of the two lost
members of the Calvert expedition :
VVe travelled two days S.S.W. for 22 miles. We had a
native secured on a chain, and, although very thirsty, he
could show us no more water. He evidently did not know
the country further. Having-; only two gallons of water,
we attempted, on the following day, to return to the last
well, travelling during the night.
There are various ways of finding water in dry
Australia, and a nigger on a chain is probably the
best of them. The chain naturally becomes hot,
and if the nigger is made to run ahead in the sun
and dust, and isn’t allowed anything to drink, it
is a fair assumption that he will show the way to
water, if he knows of any. If he has been running,
say, two days at the end of the hot chain with his
tongue hanging out, and yet doesn’t point out any
water, it js a fair assumption that he doesn’t know
of any. Then the best thing is to drop him and
get another nigger. Sometimes, of course, the
aboriginal is obstinate, and holds out a long time,
but if salt is blown into him through a tube and
he is kept running on the chain, even the worst
nigger generally caves in and tells everything he
knows.
Dear Bulletin, —Just here (Narre warren,
Vic.) we are in the thick of a grasshopper plague.
On an inside calculation, they run 2cwt. to the
acre — i.e., 64 tons of solid grasshopper to the
sq. mile ! Everyone of them is a cast-iron,
armour-plated warrior with a back-kick like a
gun-spring. They start by clearing off all the
succulent vegetation, and then get to work on the
stalks and stubble. They come into the house,
too —get mashed to a paste in the door-jambs,
climb on to the ceiling, and jump into the soup.
Boiled grasshopper in the cabbage at dinner is a
common circumstance. A sft. jump is a fair
average; but the point-to-point steeplechase is
not their only method of locomotion. The local
grasshopper is also a solid grafter on the heel-and-
toe principle, and in his explorations shows small
respect for the proprieties. It is a frequent
occurrence for one of the women, hitherto placidly
reading, to let out a shriek that splits the
roof, and. make a streak for her private
boudoir with a pallid expression on her face and a
death-clutch on some portion of her apparel. Un-
fortunately, these pests have no natural enemies
worth considering. Our speckled Hamburg
rooster, an old bird with a damaged comb and
three tail-feathers, is the only one to tackle them
so far. He is always getting bunked from the
harem by the other gentlemen poultry when just
on the verge of matrimony, and he finds solace
for his disappointment in the hunting of the
grasshopper. His system is to lower his head
down alongside his prey and then make a sudden
peck sideways. Nines time in ten he strikes the
object, and down it goes to bump itself against the
pebbles and beer-bottle chips inside the old bird’s
gizzard. Watching this procedure is the only re-
lief for a mind jaded with too much grasshopper.
Had Pharaoh’s locusts been of the Vic. variety,
one can imagine that potentate requesting Moses
“ to remove these insects, and resume operations
on the first born.”—W.B.

Business, Bobbery, etc.
Melbourne business men are wondering how the
recent death of a certain wealthy lady will affect a large
mercantile Arm and the bank which is supporting it on
the lady’s guarantee. , , ,
Australian business is slowly but surely follow-
ing the American lead, and is run by rings. Melbourne
has two timber-rings (boxes and Kauri pine), a candle
ring, a hardware ditto, a huge wool ring, two coal, a
paper, a fish, and a wool ring.
There may be “nothing in it,” but Melbourne
is being almost flooded with brand-new Jubilee half-
crowns, florins, and shillings.

Until a few months ago, stamp vendors licensed
by N.S.W. Govt, got a commission of 2J percent, on sales.
P.M.G. Cook thought they were doing too much business
—they kept long hours, and went out of their way to be
obliging—so he reduced the commission to 11 per cent.
Even at this reduction some vendors persisted in selling
too many stamps, and making themselves too convenient
to the public, to the prejudice of regular G.P.O. sales, so
P.M.G. Joe Cook has cancelled some of the most useful
vendors’ licenses altogether. Somebody used to sell
stamps on Circular Quay, and somebody else in Lower Pitt-
st., and the people nearest to them naturally patronised
them instead of going up to the Exchange P.O. or round
to George-st. P.M.G. Joe Cook has shut off those vendors’
supplies, and the public have to tramp up to the Exchange
P.O. or round to George-st. whether they like it or no.
What does the State P.O. exist for—for the public con-
venience, or—as Herbert Spencer would have us believe —
for the benefit of a woodenheaded official despotism?
The latter, says P.M.G. Joe Cook.

Again the Bank of Barataria. Years ago they
tell now that gorgeous institution bought up a little
church adjoining its principal premises at a cost of
£17,000, and turned the grounds into a stable for the
gilded manager. Also, that little church received in
addition a handsome overdraft, and proceeded to build a
stately temple overlooking the city. But this was a very
long time ago, and—of course—in Barataria.

British shindykit, who failed to pot the Lon-

petered. Wherefore the Maritana has £3OOO in hand to
further toss down its shaft.

It is singular that three out of every four minor
mining-experts in W.A. have been either Wesleyan
ministers or local preachers, who have given up their con-
tract for bruising the head of the serpent to pronounce
authoritative opinions upon a subject of which they are
equally ignorant. It was one of these whom Pluto so
peremptorily discharged from Hades a few months ago,

Shocking example of Bendigo “liberality.”

The careful, cautious, “ eaten-up-with-pessi-

mines in W.A. ; to wit, Dick Hamilton, of the Great
Boulder, whose name has not been connected with any
cat; Callahan, of Lake View, who knocked the bottom
out of many a duffer in the country ; Hewitson, selected
for the Ivanhoe because of his reliability. As soon as
some really good mines were found the men whose hands
remained clean were put in command of them.

“Mary S.” writes to The Bulletin for a few
particulars concerning any inexpensive stook (under six-
pence, if possible) in which she could buy some fully
paid-up shares. She wants the stock at a “sprat.” per
share, to “ take a rise soon,” because she doesn’t wish to
hold. Also, the lady is anxious for “an idea of what
the rise” might be, as a guide for selling, and she will be
greatly obliged by an early reply to her enquiries in this
journal. Can somebody oblige Mary with a parcel of
fully paid-up sixpennies which are addicted to early
rising ?

N.S. Wales has this harvest for the first
time in history a bigger aggregate wheat-yield than Vic-

cheese in Melbourne. Extension of scientific cultivation
in the Riverina accounts for both facts.

The Australian Mail, which barracks for the
W.A. boom, regards the acceptance of a £lOOO a year
billet by Daly, the Argus special, as a counterbalance to
the vituperation coming from Westralia’s eastern neigh-
bors. It also refers to the amount of money sent over
each month by miners to their families. Like the miners,
Daly went out because he could make more money there,
and others will continue to go as long as Bull is willing to
spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in working mines
without gold.

The price of copper seems to have established

The accountant of a big Australian firm had his
books overhauled lately, with the result that a four-figure
deficiency was discovered. He was called before the
bosses and asked what he intended to do. “Oh, noth-
ing,” airily replied the embezzler, “it is for you to do some-
thing—prosecute, I think, is the best thing.” “ Very well,
we will,” said the bosses. “ And, of course, if you do,”
added the embezzler, “ I will take care to disclose those
little ways of doing business, such as and ; you
know exactly what I mean.” The bosses decided not to
blast the young man’s life by sending him to gaol, and he
has gone away on a long holiday—at the firm’s expense.

“Pa” Wilson, of Melb. Bijou fame, holds
nearly an eighth of the 48,000 scrip in Ballarat’s div.-
paying South Star.
The South Star is adopting bromo-cyanide for
treating tailings. Tests show a recovery of 91 per cent,
at a cost of 2s. a ton, and the loss in the tailings is 3dwt.
4gr. Plant to treat 4000 tons a month is going up ; an-
other 3dwt. to the ton is expected to be added to the
yield, and much satisfaction is expressed. Not a word is
said in explanation of defective milling. To lose over
3dwt. in Joz. Ballarat quartz is surely something to be
ashamed of.
The Spirit Vendetta .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Your sister Alaiavahas come to the next
village, and she lies there sick,” they said to Siati.
“ Kalofal” he answered; “may she recover
soon.”
“ She longs with a sick longing for soaas and
sucking-pig.”
“ Kalofa ! Soa’as have I none, and my pigs are
old for sucklings; moreover, flesh is bad for the
sick. May she eat vaisalo and cooked esi and
recover.”
And he went not to see her.
“ It is bad,” said the others. “ Brothers should
go to their sisters when illness comes.”
And Alaiava recovered not, but died; and they
made her a fine funeral with baked meats.
To the funeral came Siati, bringing a pig, and
empty papalangi beer-bottles to border the grave,
and a papalangi bowl to place on it; and round
the grave they planted the ti-ula, the red-leaved
dracaena with white flower spikes.
But they said: “ It is not well for brothers to
bring bottles and bowls after death, when they
deny food in life.” .
And the swallows swooped low around Alaiava s
grave, and she rested not in it.
* * * *
After that there was much commotion
among the spirits of the dead in the village of
Valevao, in the Island of Savaii, where was
Alaiava’s home in her life-time ; and the spirits
held a fono round the mausoleum of the greatest
traditionary chief in the village. Then all those
belonging to Alaiava’s family drew apart and
travelled away together.
That night a wise woman of Siati’s village, who
had been holding converse with the owls and the
butterflies, spoke to the villagers and said : “ There
are too many spirits around our village to-night.
The anganga (soul) of Alaiava has brought them.
Evil will come of it.”
And the next day Siati sickened, and three days
after he was dead.
They made a great funeral for him, and forbade
the Siva and the song all through the district, and
kept the high-road and the waterway sacred from
the passing of strangers; for he was a chief and
deserved such honors. But they sighed, with
anxious faces, for they said:
“Behold, it is not well for a brother to neglect
his sick sister ; evil must come of it, and who
knows where the evil shall end ? ”
And the face of Siati’s next brother waxed pale,
and his bones ached with cold, and he trembled
with fear.
Then the wise woman, who was also the village
doctor, spake to him, saying :
“ Send to the wise man at Valevao to know the
truth of this matter, lest thou also perish ; for my
medicines cannot help thee.”
And the brother went himself to consult the
wise man.
“ It is even so,” said the wise man, when he had
thought deeply ; “ I have known it for some days.
The anganga of Alaiava was wrath with Siati for
that he had not visited her when she was sick.
And her soul came to the tombs of her ancestors
and told the spirits of her uncles and aunts and
Grandparents, and they also were wroth with
iati. So they all went to pay him a visit, and
of that visit he died.”
“ And is it ended ? ” asked the trembling
brother. . . .
“ Nay, not so ; for even now the spirit of Siati
is angered and he would punish one of his sister’s
family in Valevao, which is not the right way to
makepeace. For the wrath of Alaiava s spirits'
continues therefore, and they seek another victim
Thou art the next in line.”
“ And what shall be done to make peace ?
“ Bring mats,” said the wise man.
• • * •
So the brother went home and told his
village. Whereat they held a fono and decided to
spare all the mats they could, for fear of further
mischief. They brought together mats in abund-
ance, each household one or more, and those
households that had no mats to offer brought rolls
of siapo. The mats and the siapo were all placed
on the large village-boat and the chiefs and their
. sons started off in it, each man taking an oar. But
there was but one flag flying and that a black one,
and there was neither drum nor bugle heard ; and
the chiefs wore no ti girdles, and no wreaths save
a white strip of pandanus fibre ; and as they
rowed they neither chanted nor laughed to the
stroke of their oars.
Thus they arrived at Valevao in Savaii ; but
when the people there saw the mats that they had
brought they welcomed them gladly, and killed
pigs, and lighted the ovens, and made tafolo, and
there was much feasting and rejoicing.
Thus were the spirits of the uncles and aunts
and grandparents Of Alaiava appeased, and the
anganga of Alaiava came back to its tomb and
rested there ; and the spirit of Siati forgot to be
angry, for it saw that it was in the wrong. So
the brethren of Siati came home and worked
in their taro-fields and planted their yams and cut
down their nuts for copra in peace.
And the swallows flew high, and nobody
sickened in the village, for the mats had brought
pardon.
* * « •
And this happened in the Islands of Savaii
in this present year 1896, within a month of the
writing thereof. And if any doubt —there lie the
mats.

H. Mitchell, pilot steamer, Brisbane,
writes :
Bulletin of 9th Jan. says George Clarke was the dis-
coverer of Mambare goldfield. This is incorrect, for
Clarke never completed the distance you have to travel
by boat before reaching the field : he was killed in his
boat whilst ascending one of the five or six falls you have
to ascend before arriving at the head of the river. I was
in charge of the steam launch which towed Gov.
Macgregor up thp Mambare —the first time a white man
was up. We went up as far as possible with the launch,
and then I took the whaleboat under Capt. Hennessey’s
supervision, and Gov. Macgregor his gig, and we went
right up as far as a boat would float, and then went pros-
pecting. It was our reports that brought G. Clarke and
party there afterwards, so he would doubtfully have been
entitled to the credit of discovery even if he had reached
the head of the river. As far as actual prospecting goes,
his party deserve the credit, because after Clarke was
killed they went further even than we did. I cannot re-
member all their names, but Alick Clunes took the
leadership, and Simpson, M'Laughlin, and Alick Elliott
(all of Sudest) and two or three of Clarke’s party from
Cairns, were the first lot that went inland.

BRIGHT EYES, ROSY CN€€KS, ANP HAPPINESS.
PALE AND SALLOW FACES.
DIZZINESS, SHORTNESS OE
BREATH.
HEART PALPITATION, &c.
This world is full of suffering and unhappiness. In every walk
of life may be seen young girls, pale, sallow, and nerveless, the
victims of troubles peculiar to their sex, from which they suffer
in silence, and with the mistaken notion that there is no help for
them. Their lives are made miserable by headaches, dizziness,
palpitation of the heart, shortness of breath on the slightest ex-
ertion ; an indisposition for either work or pleasure, and frequently
a feeling that life is but a dreary burden scarcely worth preserving.
To all such we say take hope ; there is a cure for your trouble, and
it is within your power to be bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked, and happy.
Dr. Williams’ PINK PILLS for PALE PEOPLE will restore
your lost color, correct irregularities, and bring back health and
happiness. In proof of this assertion, read the following testi-
mony from those who have suffered and found renewed health
through this marvellous medicine.
Miss Catherine Elood, daughter of Patrick Flood, Esq., who
lives a few miles from Mallorytown, Ont., says :—“A little more
than a year ago I began to decline in health. I felt constantly
tired, my appetite failed, and my color was deathly. My father
saw a doctor and described my case, and he said the trouble was
anaemia, and sent me a bottle of medicine. I found that the medi-
cine did not agree with me and discontinued it. I was constantly
growing worse, and was subject to weak spells, and was fast
becoming little more than a living skeleton. One Sunday after I
had been to church a friend who returned with me strongly urged
me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I decided to give them a
trial, and my father purchased a supply. The first change I
noticed was that the dizziness was leaving me, then my appetite
improved and my color began to return, and soon I was enjoying
as good health as I had ever done. It is now about a year since I
discontinued the use of the pills, and I have not felt one symptom
of the old trouble. I believe that Pink Pills saved me from the
grave, and I strongly urge other girls who may be in a condition
similar to mine to try them. ”
Mr. William Stoughton is a well-known and much esteemed
farmer living in the vicinity of Barryvale, Renfrew, Ont. He is
one of many who have reason to bless the day that Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills were brought into his home, for they saved the life of
his daughter. Mr. Stoughton says“ In 1893, my daughter

then a picture of health
and strength, went to
Ardock, N orth Dakota.
In April of that year
she caug ht a severe
cold, which brought
her to the verge of the
grave. The cold was
followed by headache,
dizziness and palpita-
tion of the heart, and
she became so pale and
emaciated that her
doctor there said she
was going into con-
sumption, and advised
her return home. She
had been under the
doctor’s care for some
months' before this
advice was given, and
in February, 1894, she
returned home. She
was so weak as to be
almost helpless, and
we decided that the
uBst thing’ to be done
Kingston Hospital, where she could have trcfto/nuh^ 6
was possible m our country home. She remained for two months
in the hospital, gradually growing weaker instead of stronger and
as it seemed to us that there was no hope of recovery we
brought her home. At this time she was so weak as k!
scarcely able to walk across a room and was Lli
almost constantly to her bed. She wks pale and terribly
emaciated, had constant pain in her back and li " had

In the Half-Light .
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Still in the half-light halting we have heard one
more patrol,
And the sound of a challenge fallen out of the
waking West ;
There is a voice in the mountains, and from sentinel
soul to soul
A whisper of day spring passes, and the murmur
of pent unrest.
Linger not, twilight of tutelage! for we fain would
see her throned
In her morrow of majesty peerless—Australia,
our gracious Queen !
From her toil in the leaf-lands glowing, with the
might of her youth enzoned,
Breathing a scent of hillsides mown ; in her eyes
dominion serene.
Throned with the sovereign sisters! what if no lurid
plain,
No homeward roll of the victor wheels set her
defiant there ?
Are there no primal foes laid low under the
ripened grain—
No conquered demons of Loneliness, and
Desert, and fierce Despair ?
In the stern hill-holds, in the silent lands by the
channels of mocking thirst,
They sleep, the leaders who fought and fell, who
labored and dumbly died ;
There are who may win our battles yet, but these
shall not be first,
While the west winds tell of the unknown great
whose graves the blown sands hide.
By the flicker of bivouac fires there is a space for
thought—
Not that we huddle round dying lights or vainly
the issue doubt ;
But nation has sprung from nation, and empire
from empire wrought
Has writ upon Time its story, and the moral
glares starkly out.
Will the mock-stars be ours, my brothers ? Shall
we take for our eidolon theirs ?
Empurpled with power, but forgetting the rags
of the stifled poor ;
Our peace but a standing-at-ease for ever in hollow
squares,
While the flesh of toil is galled with steel of
panoplied war ?
Nay, not as theirs be our Statehood, girt with a
Nessus-robe,
Division of soul and heartfelt wrong under all
armour proud ;
In vain for this had our vestal fires ringed the
dark under-globe;
In vain for this were the wild hills tamed and
the leagues of desert ploughed.
Away with the dragon banners and the motto
dead words unseal!
Have we not living hearts to spell into deeds of
our own dear fame ?
One deathless meaning to make of Nation and
Commonweal,
One path as wide as the waves that eastward
dance with dawn aflame ?
Is there a hue of strife in the dawn-sky or battle
rude?
So be it; shield-borne we shall raise her, front-
ing the alien hordes:
Australia will know no flinching, last born of a
lion brood,
She will call to her sons and they shall fringe
the shore with a surf of swords.
From Tasman’s Isle unto Torres, from Moreton
Bay to the Swan,
From the still-hushed heart of the inmost west
to the sea-vexed river-bars,
From the sands that are still nnconquered to the
plains that our fathers won,
They will fall into square and column under the
white Cross-stars !
Under our own starred blue ; for the old blood-
deepened red
With its emblem of sordid triumph would vex
the untainted skies :
Afar is it sought of the vultures thrice-gorged
with the Nations dead,
And the ravens haunt its shadow with their
evil-boding cries.
To the better Britain that yet may be—brother-
hood long and dear !
While we too share of the glory that shame
cannot all unsay ;
But here, in our capitol stately, knowing nor
pause nor fear,
We shall crown our sovereign Future, and the past
shall not bar the way.
Dec. 26, 1896.
C. KENDALL.
The death of diver Madsen from spinal
compression when down a few fathoms in Sydney
Harbor raises the question of regular medical in-
spection of all divers. Manv persons—instance
sufferers from heart trouble—are totally unfit to
brave the deep, and should be prohibited from
doing so.
Innot Springs, on Nettle Creek, some 25
or 30 miles from Herberton (N.Q.), which have
been famous locally for years, are coming into
favor with whites suffering from rheumatism,
sciatica, &c. The springs are used both for
bathing purposes and internally as mineral waters.
They vary in temperature from 165 to 185 deg.
and a few yards from the hottest is to be found
ice-cold water. A co. is being formed in N.Q. to
acquire and conserve the springs.
“Half the world doesn’t know how the
other half lives.” Does half the world know how
the other half dies ? Printed in small type and
hidden in obscure corners, one meets every day in
the N.S.W. press these pitiful pars (actual clip-
pings on dates given) :
An old swagmin named Peterson was found dead by his
mate on the road two miles from Yass, N.S.W.—3O/12/’96.
A verdict of heat-apoplexy was returned in the ease of
a bushman who was found dead in the scrub near Trundle
N.S.W.— 31/12/’96. ’
An elderly swagman, a stranger in the district, was
seen to stagger and fall last Sunday near Dapto, N.S W
He was carried under the shade of a verandah, where life
was found to be extinct.—l/l/’97.
The body of an unknown swagman was found in a
shearer’s hut at Combaning station, near Temora, N.S.W.
A match-box found on him contained a threepenny-bit
and a Union ticket issued to James Connelly by Wasr-a
Branch A.W.U.— 2/1/97. J i ®
An inquest was held on the body of a swagman found
near Lagawarra, N.S.W. No clue to identity.—3 l/’97.
The body of a man named Dunlop was found near a
gate five miles from Pooncarie, Darling River, NSW
He was a victim of thirst.—4/l/’97.
The body of an unknown swagman was found on Glen-
lyon station, near Broken Hill. A Union ticket issued to
Arthur Hasley found on him was the only clue to his
identity.—s/l/’97.
And that’s how the swagmen die !
Mich Mulleeran’s Humility.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Michael Mulleeran was neither a squatter
nor a cocky; but something between the two.
“ We kem out wid money an’ we’ve made money,”
said Mick. “Leastways the wife has,” he always
carefully added.
Mrs. Frances Mulleeran was a lady and beauti-
ful. Patrician in every movement, and as gentle
as Mick was rough. She handed her cup to her
husband with infinite grace, and smiled with sweet
condescension as Mick grabbed the crockery and
rushed to the sideboard with it. “For ’tis meself
knows how much crarne me darlint loikes,” he
averred.
“ The devil a finger he’d lave her sile, at all, at
all,” declared the gossips of Irishtown.
“ It isn’t for wurruk I married ye, Frances,
darlint,” said Mick.
» * * «
Donations in money or in kind to the
church were always made in the name of Mrs.
Frances Mulleeran, and Mick glorified her name
on every possible occasion.
One Candlemas Day Father M’Cooey read from
the altar a list of contributors: “ John Daniel
O’Ryan, 41b. _ of wax candles ; Mistress Regan,
widow, 21b. imported sperm candles; Jeremiah
Regan, son of above, lib. of sperm candles ; Katie
Regan, daughter of above 21b. best tallow candles
for general use ; Mistress Frances Mulleeran, 31b.
of wax candles ; Mistress Mac ”
“Hould an, yer Riverance,” interrupted Mick
in a loud voice, “Misthress Frances Mulleeran,
foive pound o’ wax candles, iv ye plaze. ”
Upon which correction the priest amended the
item, the congregation looked approval, and Mick
sat up with a self-conscious air of having dared to
do his duty.
The family pew was rented in the name of Mrs.
Frances Mulleeran ; the receipt for the plot of
ground in the cemetery bore the same name, as
also did the title-deeds of the homestead. And
all the stock were branded F.M.
* * * *
The children, two girls, as rough in nature
and appearance as their burly father, regarded
their mother with a mixture of reverence and con-
tempt. At times she shyly strove to teach them
some of her gentle arts, but Mick would brusquely
interfere, with—“ Don’t be throublin’ yerself wid
such ignorant haythens, Frances, darlint ! Lave
’em to Father M'Cooey and the school-inasther.”
So the girls continued to roam the paddocks.
They fought with the school-master and the neigh-
bours’ boys whenever opportunity offered, and
dodged their father’s stockwhip as best they could.
They were big, untidy girls, who jarred on Mrs.
Frances Mulleeran’s susceptibilities ; but it was no
use protesting. Mick always insisted that their
habits were “ good enough for the loikes av thim;”
and forbade reform.
* * * *
Occasionally Mick would paint the town-
ship in varied tints. While the drinking fit was
on him any neighbors who might endeavor to coax
him towards home generally had to fight a drunken
madman or run. So they got into the way of
sending word to Mrs. Frances Mulleeran that
Mick was “ oncontrollable down beyant at the
pub. ”
The gentlewoman would then be driven down to
the township, and would politely ask the publican
if her Mulleeran was within. Sometimes he was
within, sometimes he was without—in the back-
yard, fighting; but, within or without, directly
he heard his wife’s voice he climbed unsteadily, yet
silently, into the buggy, and drove off home. On
one or two occasions Mick’s fellow J’sP. at Irish-
town were regretfully compelled to fine him a
nominal sum for drunkenness and resisting
the police. The fine was paid by a cheque
drawn by Mrs. Frances Mulleeran, and Mick
interviewed the editor of the local paper
with a threat of summary vengeance of a personal
nature and a stoppage of subscription if the words
“by Mrs. Frances Mulleeran ” were not attached
to the usual notification that “ the fine was paid.’'
The words duly appeared.
“ ’Tis herself is the grand manager,” was Mick’s
constant comment on his wife. But the only
managing the lady did was to manage Mick him-
self when drunk. Sober, he was a despot—in
nothing so despotic as in his worship of his angelic
wife.
Where Mick found such a wife nobody could
imagine. “ They kem out together” was all the
gossips could be sure of.
* * • *
Mick’s visits to the township grew more
frequent, and the horse was kept constantly in
the homestead stable ready for Mrs. Frances
Mulleeran to drive down to fetch home her drink-
sodden husband.
But she never complained. On the contrary,
she seemed more contented as Mick sunk lower
and lower. She was 35 and still fascinatingly
beautiful.
Mick’s business “beyant” eventually assumed
such proportions that he engaged an overseer to
look after things on the homestead. The overseer
was handsome, cultured, and compelling. He
found his affinity. After a week’s uninterrupted
spree, Mick crawled home and found his wife had
gone. The overseer had also gone.
Father M‘Gooey sent the children away to a
convent-school, and Mick drank harder than ever.
In less than three months he received legal
notice to quit the homestead of Frances Mulleeran.
Father O’Dale doubted the legality of the pro-
cedure, and suggested that Mick should come with
him to the city to consult a lawyer.
“Look here, yer riverence, isn’t this her own
name on the dokkymint—Mishtress Frances
Mulleeran ? ”
“ Yes ; but, my poor dear man ” began the
priest.
“Then, be jabers!” said Mick, “there’ll be no
damned lawyers interfarin’ wid her intintions, if
Mick Mulleeran knows it.”
And there were not. A week later they found
Mick floating face-down wards among the rushes
by the edge of the wash-pool.
