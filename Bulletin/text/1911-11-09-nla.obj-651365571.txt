Dynamiting the Marriage Tie
For years past—in fact, ever Since the
time was ripe—this Socialistic continent has
been shown the dread vision of the gibbous
white waistcoat of Capital scooting for the
breakers of the Pacific, the smashing up of
the kitchen table and the gas stove of the
humble home, and the rending into many
pieces of the' marriage tie. But, so far, this
triple Socialistic cyclone has missed us. The
only person who unloosens the marriage
cravat is the Divorce Court Judge—and his
is a reliable and old-established business.
It is not in Australia, but in Sweden that
the marriage lines are being torn from the
virtuous wife’s bosom, and scattered in frag-
ments on the heads of hubby and the kid-
dies. And the villain in the play is, presum-
ably, a spinster, and her job for 20 years
has been that of Professor of the History of
Civilisation in the Popular University of
Stockholm. Her name is Ellen Key. She
is the foremost woman of Sweden, and fam-
ous in Germany as the leader of the
woman’s movement. Having these high
qualifications as spinster and professor, she
is quite the proper person to write upon
Love and Marriage (Putnam, New York),
Ellen Key has come to the conclusion that
it is not enough for her sex to claim
woman’s place as a human being, but it has
also become necessary to claim women’s
place in the world as a woman. The
women’s rights movement has brought the
sex into a keen, competitive struggle with
man, and yet allowed women to bring no
contribution of their own to the solution of
common problems. She grants the claim of
women to be like men—that is, in respect to
social and civil rights; but her supreme
claim is to be unlike men, and to enforce
that unlikeness upon men.
Unlike the suffragettes, Ellen Ivey does
not want to see a world where the women
would be but copies of the men, for the ob-
vious reason that in such a world- nobody
would fall in love. But she proclaims that
the modern development of individuality
would prevent such a grey consummation.
“Already men and women respectively differ
among themselves as much as the two sexes
from each other.” And men, she states, for
reasons carefully argued, “will always re-
main more polygamous than women....
Woman seldom finds herself occupying his
thoughts and feelings so completely as he
occupies hers.” Besides his love, a woman
may have a calling in life. But the pro-
found distinction between woman and man
is just this: that he more often gives of his
best as a creator than as a lover, w’hile with
her the reverse is nearly always the case.
Man apprises himself and others according
to his work. Woman values herself —and
wishes to be valued—according to her love.
Woman is, in this modern competitive
world, the universal blackleg. Ellen Key
sees this fact clearly. She exhorts women
workers to organise to obtain higher wages
and shorter hours, and asks girls who live
with their parents not to take work at
other rates of pay than those that the
wholly self-supporting can live on—-the min-
imum wage. Women, she says, should cease
to think themselves meritorious merely be-
cause they work —without troubling about
the harm their underpaid labor may do to
the whole community.
jt
Ellen Key, like another Nietzsche,
preaches a new morality. She wants free
divorce and a new marriage law.
Strictly defined, she says:
Monogamy has never yet been a reality
even among the Christian nations, except
for a minority of individuals; and all the
progress that is ascribed to Christian civil-
isation has taken place while monogamy was
indeed the law, but polygamy the custom.
Love is the only sanction of marriage; with-
out love there is no marriage, and with love,
a mere ceremony, civil or religious, is un-
necessary.
The prejudice, originally fostered by
Christianity that sexual purity is in itself
so great an asset in life that it outweighs
the sacrifice of all others —this prejudice
must be overcome. A person is estimable
for sexual purity only to the extent to which
it fits him to fulfil the purpose of life for
himself and for the race: that of leading an
ever higher life.
The present laws of marriage are to her
only a survival of past conditions, unfitted
for this modern world. Religious, civic .and
social emancipations have been granted to,
or won by, humanity; but marriage has re-
mained unaltered.
The marriage law now in force is a geo-
logical formation, with stratifications be-
longing to various phases of culture now
concluded. Our own phase alone has left
few and unimportant traces in it.... Our
time has given to the unmarried woman the
opportunity of making her own living, a le-
gal status and civil rights. But the marriage
law dates from a time when women had none
of these things. The married woman, thus,
under this law, now occupies a position in
sharp contrast to the independence of the
unmarried, which has been acquired since
that time....
The existing institution of marriage forces
upon human beings, who are seldom ideal, a
unity which only an ideal happiness renders
them capable of supporting. It fulfils one
of its missions—that of protecting the
woman—in a way that is now humiliating
to her human dignity. It performs its second
function —that of protecting the children —in
an extremely imperfect fashion. Its third—
that of setting up an ideal of the morality of
sexual relations —it performs in such a way
that this ideal is now a hindrance to the
further development of morality....
The unmarried woman who has given her
love “freely”—that is, without legal compen-
sation in the form of a right of maintenance
—retains full authority over her children, as
well as personal liberty, responsibility and
civil rights. In other words, she retains all
that gives her a dignified position as a human
being in society—but loses the respect of
society and economic security. The married
woman, on the other hand, loses all that is
important to a member of society of full age,
but retains the respect of society, her right
of inheritance and her support....
No relation shows better than marriage
how morals and emotions may be centuries
in advance of the laws within whose limits
they have been developed.
In short, this feminine Swedish professor
sees marriage in R. L. Stevenson’s phrase,
f“a kind of friendship sanctioned by the
police.”
The suitor, who —dressed for the occasion
—went first to the father to declare his feel-
ings for the daughter is already such an old-
fashioned type that it is past ridicule. The
brilliant wedding festival will soon coriie to
be regarded as ridiculous, then unbecoming,
and, finally, immoral....
Public opinion as regards a dissolved mar-
riage will take the broader view that it has
already acquired in the question of a broken
engagement, whicn at one time was thought
just as humiliating as a divorce is now.
Jt
Free divorce, depending solely on the will of
both parties, or of .one, maintained for a
certain time, is one of the main planks of
Ellen Key’s platform. But what of the
children? She argues that it is more im-
portant, not that the parents, who wish to
separate, should remain together, for the
sake of the children, but how the parents
remain- together, and what they become by
remaining together. When the cause of di-
vorce is differences of temperament and
opinion between the parents, she suggests
that the children are better off by the
divorce of these opposing wills.
A child has often: —in moments of great
crisis—blocked the way that led from the
door of the home. But the home within that
door did not, for that reason,.become brighter
or warmer for the child.
That so many more unnappy marriages
continue than are dissolved may be due less
to a sense of duty than td the fact that only
a few are capable of great emotions.
As to marriage itself, Ellen Key contends
that every wife should be paid for her do-
mestic work, either the wages she was
getting before she married or the same
amount as a stranger in corresponding cir-
cumstances would receive in salary and cost
of keep. In other words, when a man of
the future marries, he won’t get a house-
keeper without wages. «
And, in addition, society should pay every
wife an allowance for her maintenance dur-
ing the time she is bearing aiid rearing her
children. This suggestion is already par-
tially in force in certain of the European
States. ■ - " ■
Only by society undertaking the support
of those women who, by well fulfilling, the
duties of motherhood, have produced the
highest social asset, can the question of
married women’s bread-winning be solved.
And only if women put their personal cre-
ative desire into their mission as mothers
during their children’s first years, will the
problem be solved of woman's self-assertion
and of her simultaneous devotion to the mis-
sion of the race.
But the modern woman yearns “to live her
own life,” and that means a childless home.
In however high a degree a woman may be
bodily and mentally competent, this can
never prevent the time her outdoor work
occupies being a deduction from the time
she can bestow in her home, since she can-
not simultaneously be in two places, she can-'
not have her thoughts and feelings simultan-
eously centred upon and absorbed by her
work and her home. Many women, who see
the necessity of deciding for one or the other,
choose the former, and thus avoid, or limit,
their motherhood, since tlieyf. believe them-
selves to have another, richer contribution
to make to civilisation. But would not the
race have gained more by the talents of
which these gifted women might have been
the mothers?
£
But behind all these reforms lies the neces-
sity for improvement in social conditions.
The problem of marriage depends on the
people being able to marry.
It is not against immoral literature, but
against the Treasury, the Budget Committee,
and against private employers of labor that
moral reformers should draw up their reso-
lutions. So long as a business man is able
to make two or three millions a year net pro-
fit. while of those employed in his office
scarcely two or three are so paid that' they
can think of marriage before the age of 30...
so long will the marriage question remain
unsolved. All preaching of morality to youth
which does not at the same time condemn the
state of society that favors -immorality, but
makes the realisation of youthful love an
impossibility, is more than stupidity, it is a
crime.. . .It all comes down to tips: that no
doctrine of morality is of any value which
does not involve the need of providing the
means of marriage for healthy persons be-
tween the ages of 20 and 30.
And she sees no help for it but Socialism—
the sort of Socialism that this continent is
satisfied to possess. Women desire to abol-
ish prohibition. But the first condition is a
raising of 50 per cent, of the present wages
of working women and shop assistants.
“This increase can take place only by means
of trades unions, and then strikes will be
necessary.” So, also, women desire to abol-
ish war —but they beat their children.
“Women continue to lighten their work in
the nursery by employing fear. In other-
words, they themselves practise—and train
their children in—acts of violence, such as
correspond in the life of nations to the wars
these very women Wish to abolish.”
This is a point that Bernard Shaw must
be supremely annoyed at having missed.
Finally, women, this idealist spinster in-
sists, must be won back to the home.
It may be —according to a very moderate
estimate—that there are annually produced
by the women of the world a hundred thou-
sand novels and works of art, which might
better have been boys and girls!
And, perhaps, Ellen Key would agree that
better than this big book on Love and Mar-
riage would have been one small windy
baby.
Boleslas Biegas -sculptor
At once decadent and primitive, by turns
repulsive and beautiful, the work of Biegas
is, in a sense, unique. It will found no
school, it will have little real influence, but
must always -retain its interest and fascina-
tion, as the full, untrammelled expression of
a sensitive soul that has lived close to the
ffeart of things, and, as fully as Leopardi,
has seen the pity and terror and the agonies
of life. >
Thirty-four years ago Boleslas Biegas was
born at Block, in Poland. Ilis father w’as

stances, and, in his earliest years, the boy
was brought face to face with sterner

realities of life —cold,
hunger and sickness.
It w#s impossible for
his father to support
the whole family,
and, when little
more than a child,
Biegas was sent to
work as a shepherd.
This accident of oc-
cupation was of the
greatest importance.
In his solitary life
he brooded over Life
as it had appeared
to him, and there
began to form the
ideas which,
after, were<, to
take plastic shape
as •'L’Humauito,”
“Dieu,” and other
works.

cited first ad-

knew him. Soon strange stories were
circulated. He. was aided by the Devil.
He threw balls of clay into the air, and they
fell back changed into statues by the evil
spirits. At length the village priest was
approached. He must exorcise the demon.
More sceptical than his flock, he had the
boy apprenticed to a stone-cutter. Before
long his work w-as noticed, and, finally,
through the kindness of a patron, he was
enabled to attend “L’Acaddmie au Beaux-
Arts” at Cracow.
Ther-e he worked unceasingly for long
without recognition. Practically uninflu-
enced, he has developed his own style, se-
curing the ntost powerful effects by the
simnlest means.
His work is pervaded by the one idea —
Crepuscule.
weltsclimertz. A son of the people, un-
touched by any alien influence, he shows
even more fully than Tschaikovsky the in-
nate Slavonic melancholy. The hopelessness
of life, the shrinking from death, the un-
speakable horror of corruption, are revwfipl
m “L’Hnmanitf” “La Fin du Monde," or
J Mort.” Ever present is a
sense of the unimportance and littleness of
human affairs. Sometimes his symbolism
is entirely his own, as in “Le Crepuscule” •
more often it is drawn from the old Slavonic
mythology. Thus, in “L’Univers,” the old
god Swiatowid, his four faces marking the
four quarters of -the globe are shown upon
the egg-symbol of creation—while in his
hands he holds the first man and first
woman, their faces already saddened and an
prehensive. .Of all his work, the “Chopin”
is perhaps the strangest and the most sug-
gestive. It is the Chopin who fled to Paris

Playing upon a keyboard of human fingers
he sees before him the souls of those who
died in the hopeless cause. There is a
strange tenseness about the work; it is as
though the musician vainly tried to find in
art a moment’s respite from the ills of life.
Maybe it is rather the sculptor who reveals
himself.
Biegas ' weird impression of Chopin.
In “L’Esprit Puissant,” if anywhere,
Biegas preaches his message—courage with-
out hope. There, worn with disease, tor ;
tured with suffering, man awaits death and
its after-horrors with unflinching courage;
but in this—his work with greatest
ethical interest—die fails. He can excite
pity, but he never inspires. He has no
splendor, no passion,, no religious depth.
He lacks the calm serenity of the truly
great. ' ",
But he is sincere throughout. Untram-
melled by all conventions, he shows his view
of life and, incidentally, of art; and, despite
the gloom thereof, the world is the richer
for it.

The Bush Boy's Book , by Donald Macdonald
(S. J. Endacott, Melb., Is. 6d.) . The chap-
ters. upon “D'oing a Perish,” “Bush Sur-
gery,” “How ter Find the Way,” and “The
Snake Trouble” indicate the valuable nature
of the contents. And the fact that it is
written by Donald Macdonald is sufficient
indication of the manner of the writing.
Joseph McCabe, the Scientific jtuthor and
lecturer, recently in Australia, has turned
from his monist'god to do the made-to-order
book so much desired by the publisher. The
Empresses of Rome (Methuen) is a vividly-
drawn gallery of portraits of the females
(mostly Flossies) who became consorts of
the miscellaneous crowd of foreigners who
bossed the Roman Empire down to the fall
of the Western Empire. It is history made
easy—rafter Gibbon, with no mention of the
recent valuable work of Ferrero —for the
delectation of idle readers.

CLEMENTS
TONIC
GIVES HEALTH.
MANY members of the theatrical profession
have testified to the health-creating
powers of Clements Tonic. Scarcely
any profession so exactingly demands from its
members so much of brain-strength and mental
concentration in the studies of important and
nerve-trying r6les. This extends to members
of Comedy or Drama, also to those of Operatic
Choruses where singing rdles must be perfectly rendered. The letter published below in the
form of a Clements Tonic testimony was received from MISS ALICE MITC -
member of the T. C. Williamson New Comic Opera Company, who lately appeared at the
Theatre Royal, Sydney. Miss Mitchell, who keeps in the best of health by using Clements
Tonic, speaks of it as follows :
“ CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ After taking your valuable tonic for some
considerable time during an extended tour of the
Commonwealth and New Zealand, / find myself
in perfect health, and strongly recommend this
medicine to anyone run down or suffering from
over-taxation of the nerves. / also find it keeps
the singing voice dear and strong.
“ (Signed) ALICE MITCHELL.
Throughout Australia Clements Tonic is used in every profession, and its value as a health
restorer appreciated. The merits of this medicine are voiced by those who speak from practical
knowledge of its strength-creating powers.' Miss Mitchell is but one of hundreds who voice
their opinions thus, and who also recommend this medicine because they know by BENEHTS
received that in giving it to their sick friends they are giving them the medium to something
beyond price, lafting and robust health. All Chemists and Stores sell Clements Tonic.


That
Little
Hacking
Cough
Si •<£
Hard coughs are bad enough, to
be sure. But it’s often the lit-
tle, hacking, tickling, persistent
cough that means the most,
especially when there is a his-
tory of weak lungs in the family.
What should be done? Ask your
doctor. He knows. Ask him
about the formula on the label
of every bottle of Ayer’s Cherry
Pectoral. Ask him if this med-
icine has his full approval for
throat and lung troubles. Then
do as he says.

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect, flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week. Send 2d.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Tho Western Road.
There’s a Road that goes west o’ Sydney, o’er the
rugged mountain-tiers;
But the Nation is not inarching—Progress stands
by Sydney’s piers!
For Her feet are chained and shackled, and She
looks with yearning eyes
Towards the Road that stretches westward, where
Australia’s future lies!
Progress waits in ancient shackles -
They have tied Her there with tackles,
While the Western Road is calling, Progress beats
Her breast and sighs!
There’s another Road that stretches from a City by
the sea ;
But 1 hear that Nation marching—Progress there
is fair and free!
Though Iter eager feet were fettered for a hundred
galling years,
Progress gained at last Her freedom, and She
crossed the mountain-tiers !
Progress passed the Hudson River —
Now the steel-mills clang and quiver,
While that Western Road is roaring with the freight
that seeks the picis!
When that Road led west of Harlem, west o’ Broad-
way and the quays,
Lo, the thund’ring mills of Pittsburg flung their
challenge over-seas!
Progress, freed from olden bondage, towards the
future led the way ;
And the Men Who Followed After built the mighty
U.S.A.
They were Makers, Nation-Makers —-
They were strong tradition-breakers,
And the Road they built from Harlem ends at San
Francisco Bay !
There’s a Road goes west o’ Sydney, but our bygone,
shameless seers
Bade this Nation cease from marching, chaining
Progress by the piers!
So...it’s time we broke Her fetters —ancient fetters
that corrode
It is time we paid the gaolers the blood-debt we long
have owed.
For Her eyes are westward yearning—
It is time for fetich-spurning,
And the Nation’s freights should thunder on Aus-
tralia’s Western Road !

Omarism.
With pen in hand and pipe in mouth,
And claret iced to quench my drouth,
I sit upon my balcony
That overlooks the sparkling sea,
Serenely gay, and cool, and bland —-
With pipe in mouth and pen in hand.
This life I think is beautiful,
When at the jug I take a pull.
The harbor shines like azure silk ;
The claret tastes like mother’s milk ;
Then to the pipe I turn again—
And then I trifle with the pen.
The red-faced neighbors townward go ;
The air is in a fumace-glow.
I watch them scorching as they pass,
Like flies beneath a burning glass—
Each clutching at the red-hot hour
For coin ; their folly turns me sour.
The Business Man may fret and sweat
In his black coat, for etiquette,
And grow in shop and office old,
And gather wrinkles with his gold—
-1 sit in shirt-sleeves cool and bland,
With pipe in mouth and pen in hand.
The white clouds—idle they as I
Like dreaming gods, at leisure lie
Upon the hill-crests. Smoke upcurls
From chimneys lazily, and girls
Below me, with bare, brown arms fine,
Are pegging linen on a line.
The great ships, from the world outside,
Steam slowly in with stately pride,
Their giant screws now gently spin ;
’Tis good to watch them gliding in
Froni East, and West, and North, and South,
With jug in hand and pipe in mouth.
These visions fill me with content,
And I remember not the rent.
When with cool breezes comes the night
It will be time enough to write.
Then you shall see me start the band—
With pipe in mouth and pen in hand.
OREEVE ROE.
Twenty Years Ago.
Beneath this bough, a hoary sinner,
My dreams were all of beer and dinner,
When, floating through the golden weather,
I saw a hat, and knew the feather,
And all the time when roses blow,
Came back from twenty years ago.
I knew the words her lips would utter,
I felt my pulses all a-flutter,
I felt my warm blood all a-tingle,
For it was May, and May was single,
And laughing Joy with cheeks aglow
Came back from twenty years ago.
I felt old Time take back each wrinkle,
And each white hair his years could sprinkle,
I was no more the hoary sinner
Whose life’s romance was each day’s dinner,
For laughing May stooped o’er me low,
And it was twenty years ago.
With what sweet witchery beguiling,
Her blue eyes into mine were smiling,
She gave, as one who never misses,
A dozen stray and rosy kisses,
And all the time I seemed to know
’Twould be as twenty years ago.
For then, as now, I seemed a-dreaming,
With that gold hair above me gleaming,
The bending bough, the amber weather,
The shady hat, the floating feather—
And each tall curse that Time can grow,
Sprang up from twenty years ago.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and. to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be re-
fused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the
publishers. The right to reproduce or translate any

pressly reserved by the publishers.

ticable, acknott ledge in the “Correspondence” col-
umn all contributions submitted, whether in the
form of l’oliticalf Social or other Articles, Verse,

tralian subjects, and not exceeding two columns in
length, or, say, 3000 words, are specially accept-
able), Paragraphs, Betters or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications will he regarded as strictly confi-
dential.
The Bulletin will return all unsuitable US.
when the address is specified and stamps are en-
closed. But no MS. will be returned, or preserved,
unless these conditions are observed. When MS. is
forwarded without stamps for return it will be un-
derstood that the copy is to be destroyed if not ac-
ceptable. Personal applications for return of MS.
cannot receive attention. The Bulletin desires,
further, those sending MS. to distinctly understand
that it is not responsible for the preservation or
transmission of MS.
To Amateurs in Black and White.
Anyone supplying to The Bulletin original
humorous or other topical drawiiigs in line or wash,
of sufficient merit and interest and adapted for
DIRECT reproduction, or any interesting photograph
illustrative of a current event, will be paid for same
on acceptance. Any picture containing a good idea,
but unfitted for direct reproduction — i.e., any pic-
ture which has to be re-drawn —will be paid for as a
suggestion only. The conditions under which such
artistic contributions will be received are those
applying to MS.

THE ART OF BEING UTTERLY FUTILE.
Tiie tiredest man in Australian politics,
John Murray, State Premier of Vic-
toria. stood on bis almost superfluous feet
at Warrnambool, last week, and expounded
his policy. Murray goes to the country as
a loafing and unabashed public ruin. He
is so large a ruin that he ought to be called
Tadmor. He has been nearly three years in
office, and in that time his lack of achieve-
ment has been marvellous. After a perfunc-
tory. fashion he has brought in a number of
fairly meritorious measures, and in a fashion
that had no trace of perfunctoriness about it
the House of Rich Landlords threw them
out when they came its way. Certainly a
fair number of propositions were passed
during last session, and the one before —Loan
Bills, Appropriation Bills, Bills to provide
a public park at some place no one ever
heard of, and to authorise a drainage scheme
at the hamlet of no place in particular, and
to'clear up the legal tangles of sonje institu-
tion at a spot which is no good to man or
beast, and to permit an obscure Methodist
congregation to sell a bit of land that lies
at the back of the north wind. This small
dust of legislation made a certain show of
activity and success. But all the time the
matters that really counted were either re-
jpcted by the House of Landlord®, or left
unfinished by the House of Landlords, or
dropped by the Assembly because it wasn t
worth while pressing them, in view of the
known hostility of the’ House of Landlords.
And Murray, who seems incapable of real,
manly indignation, and too exhausted to
fight, and too untidy to argue, made no seri-
ous protest. Once, indeed, when the Land-
lords had been more insolent than usual, he
so far roused himself as to suggest that, when
the next batch of M’s.L.C. went to their
propertied constituents for re-election, they
would be opposed by progressive candidates.
But the promise died of old age and national
decay. Murray made no effort to dig up
even one progressive candidate. Appar-
ently, he cannot dig, but to sag he is not
ashamed.
It has become so obvious, at last, that no
really progressive measure will get
through the Victorian State Parliament
until the Upper House is amended, that a
Premier, or would-be Premier, who doesn’t
talk Council reform to the people might as
well not talk at all. He would be “Hamlet’’
with Denmark and its contents left out. So
Murray, at Warrnambool, made a grotesque
show of declaring war against the Rich
Landlords. He is going, it seems, to fight
like the very devil in this matter —like a
small, lame devil, or possibly like a dead
devil, hut, anyhow, he is going to fight. He
proposes to pass through the Assembly, and
send to the Upper House, a Bill to reduce
the property qualification for Upper House
voters, thereby considerably increasing the
number of the said voters. He also proposes
to reduce the property qualification for mem-
bers, so that others besides Rich Landlords
may be allowed to sit. And, in case the
reformed Council may still prove Tory and
obdurate, Murray propounds a method of
dealing with deadlocks —-a method which is
a marvel of reckless humility. There
are various remedies for deadlocks. In Nor-
way, when the two Houses disagree, they end
the matter by sitting together and taking a
joint vote, and, as they are elected on
exactly the same franchise, the system works
well enough. In the Australian Parlia-
ment, where also the two Houses are elected
by adult suffrage, the final remedy is a
joint vote. In Britain, where the two
Houses don’t equally represent'the people,
the simple remedy is that, when the Com-
mons passes a Bill, and the Lords reject it—
well, it passes just the same, and the
blessed old Lords don’t count any more than
if they were a herd of cattle. But the gentle
though crumpled Murray avoids these pas-
sionate devices. He proposes that, if the
Assembly passes a Bill, and the Council re-
jects it in two successive Parliaments (not
sessions, but Parliaments, so that the mat-
ter may hang fire for nearly six years), both
Houses may be dissolved. That is in itself a
notably foolish idea, for if the measure has
been rejected in two successive Parliaments
there must already have been an appeal upon
it by one House, and perhaps by both —as
definite an appeal, that is, as can be se-
cured by any,’ process except the referendum.
However, Murray proposes another appeal,
and, when it is made, the Assembly’s con-
stituency may be expected to say “Yes” as
before, possibly by a moderate majority.
And the more limited constituency of the
Council will probably say “No” as before,
possibly by an infinitesimal majority. It
may do this, not because it really wants to
say “No,” but because members of the
House of Landlords are unpaid, so that poor
men are shut out; because the electorates
are very large, and it costs a heap of money
to contest one, so that poor men are doubly
shut out; and because Premier Murray is
too tired, just as he was a year or so ago,
to help in the work of hunting up progres-
sive candidates.
* * * *
Then Victoria, assuming that it ever gets
a chance to enjoy the blessings of all this
futile “reform,” will be in this position: The
country will have endorsed the proposed
measure by its affirmative vote for the As-
sembly. The negative vote for the Council
will simply mean that the people who voted
“No” at the Assembly election had also
voted “No” at the Council election; while
a lot of the people who voted “Yes” at the
Assembly polls weren’t allowed to vote at
the Council polls. The will of the people
will be just as plain as it was before, and
the people will be disqualified, just as before.
When two parties come to a hopeless dead-
lock, something may be done by appeal to a
third party, but there is very little to be
pained by appeal to the same old parties.
Yet that is what Murray proposes.
These are the obvious conditions if, by
any hazard, the Great Victorian Futility
gets his absurd “reform” measure passed.
But, in the first place, there is a fair chance
that Murray, whose word in political mat-
ters is of no value whatever, will never in-
troduce the Bill. It is ten chances to one
that he won’t make any serious effort to get
it through the Assembly if he does intro-
duce it. Supposing it gets through the
Assembly, it is a million chances to one that
the House of Landlords will throw it back
with derision at Murray’s head. And after
that, the odds are all eternity to a tatter that
John, of Warrnambool, will just remark
that he has done his best, and that there is
no more to be said. Then he will probably
retire to a Nursing Home for recuperation.
There are three visible ways by which the
arrogant House of Landlords may be in-
duced to consent to the abolition of its privi-
leges. One is for the Government to find (if
such a thing is possible) and put up a quali-
fied Democratic candidate against every Rich
Landlord at every Council election, and
send out a swarm of good Democrats to
stump the country with a fury of effort on
his behalf. By that means some few Coun-
cil seats might be won, even on the present
franchise, and the Upper House might be
somewhat demoralised. But the result is
doubtful, and such a policy would require a
leader who is a perfect dynamo of energy.
The next alternative is for the Assembly
to stop supplies, and bring the whole machine
of Government to a stoppage until the terri-
fied Landlords cave in. That policy would
require a giant, and a man with something
of the hero in him. A third device is to
urge on the Unification movement, so that
all State Houses. Upper and Lower, may be
wiped out by a popular vote, and the Com-
monwealth entrusted with the job of recon-
structing the machinery of State Govern-
ment on a Democratic basis. A patriot with
patience, vigor and some of the elements of
a Hercules, might do a lot to achieve that
result. But if there are any other methods
(bar revolution or the wholesale buying of
Upper House votes) no one has yet pointed
them out.
* * * *
Certainly there is no known device by
which the most arrogant House of Privilege
in Australia can be induced to surrender to
an easy-going, good-natured, sleepy, political
lounger—a mere drifter in the surface of
events —an affable waif and stray —a man
whose courage and enthusiasm and sincerity
in public matters seem to have alike evap-
orated. Nobody surrenders to an utterly de-
spised enemy, and Murray is just that kind
of enemy. The Vic. Premier has some kind
of a programme in addition to his Upper
House reform scheme, but the best parts of
it depend on the success of the proposed re-
form, so it isn’t worth considering. Discus-
sion .on what may-possibly, happen after the
impossible has come about is waste of time.
The one matter which calls for popular at-
tention in A r ictoria, these days, is the need to
get rid of Murray —kindly and firmly, and
with the present of a magnificent brass bed-
stead as a token of goodwill, but still to get
rid of him. Of course his successor may
prove not much better; and, if so, the next
thing will be to get rid of him also. In fact,
a good and simple rule is to keep getting rid
of everybody, until there emerges from the
confusion somebody as unlike Murray as
possible.
THE COMMONWEALTH BANK-A
SUGGESTION.
A • Victorian banking magnate gave it as
his opinion, last week, that there was a bank
too many in his State, and that an amalga-
mation might be advantageous all round.
Probably the increase of population will
shortly make room for that allegedly super-
liuous concern, find things will right them-
selves. But the eslabnsiimehc of the new
uovernment institution wui mane one barnt
more, and if the competition is excessive now,
it will then be Worse. A great Ueai, or
course, depends on wiiat kinu ox bami tne
new banx is to be. ay it is going to have
unices in three or four cities omy, it won’t
add much to tile pressure, but, on the otner
hand, it won’t be a really national
bank,' assuming that to mean a baniv
that is owned by the nation and whicu
serves the nation. Yet, if it is to be an ail-
Austraiian affair, it will require to open
branches in a, multitude of towns that are
already so much banked that any increase of
effort must mean actual loss to somebody—
possibly to the new-comer. That is to say,
these things must happen unless the Com-
monwealth buys out one (or two) of the
numerous competitors, and takes its place
and its organisation.
Australia has one or two banks which,
though probably as sound as their rivals,
are very much smaller affairs than they were
20 years ago, and which carry a good deal
of top-hamper. Of these the Commercial of
Australia is a notable example. Just
before the downfall of 1893 it was, on its
aggregate figures, much larger than the
E. S. and A., the Bank of New Zea-
the Queensland National, the Bank
of Victoria, the London, the National of
Australasia —in fact, it ranked close up to
the four biggest institutions, and ahead of
everything else. It was a vast affair, and
spread itself out heroically. Ft became
the most widely-represented, so far as this
continent is concerned, of all the Australian
banks, save one. It still holds that rank.
But, though the bony fabric remains much
the same, the girth or waist measurement is
not what it was. Even including what
might be called dead or petrified business—
i.e., the assets of the old institution, which
are kept in a separate account, and are in
process of realisation —it only ranks seventh
among Australian banks, and, leaving out
these special assets, it might rank below
seventh. Yet the gigantic framework—the
242 offices and agencies—remains. It is a
remarkably large skeleton for the dimin-
ished flesh that is upon it, but there Vs prob-
ably nothing to be gained by limiting opera-
tions. It would obviously be much pleas-
anter if, instead , of, say, 100 offices earning
£1 each in a given time, there could be 20
offices earning £5 each in the same time, for
then there would be 80 fewer managers to
pay, and a handsome saving could be effected
in other respects. It is always more agree-
able and profitable to be a small, fat bank
than a large, thin one. Still, it would
be dead loss to reduce the 100 offices
by one-half, and have only 50 branches,
earning £1 each in a given time, in-
stead of twice that number. The posi-
tion is like that of a universal provider,
with half the business gone, but the whole
of the monster emporium still on hand. Of
course, an institution which has far more
branches to maintain for a certain amount
of business than its contemporaries can’t
expect to show anything amazing in the way
of profits until affairs improve, and the Com-
mercial doesn’t show anything amazing. In
fact, its ordinary shareholders haven’t seen
a dividend for quite a long while.
The Australian Parliament might seri-
ously consider whether an institution of
this sort isn’t just the one which it should
purchase, lock, stock and barrel, and use as the
foundation of the Commonwealth Bank. It is
almost the biggest banking frame or skeleton
in the Commonwealth. According to Stock
Exchange valuations it is a very cheap skele-
ton for its size, and its possibilities. It is
the only one which would give the Common-
wealth a ready-made business in every State
of the mainland, in Tasmania and in the
Northern Territory, without the embarrass-
ing attachment of a connection outside. The
purchase would remove a competitor out of
the way, and thus make more room in the
financial scrum for the new* Government in-
stitution. It would enable the Common-
wealth to at once do its own business, per
medium of its own bank, at every centre of
importance, and to make a profit in the pro-
cess, whereas, by the slow method of open-
ing new branches, and looking for entirely
new business, it might take a Quarter of a
century to create an equally wide organisa-
tion. Of course, the framework is at present
rather gaunt for its dimensions —that is the
reason why the Stock Exchange values it
cheaply; but the meat of Government busi-
ness would presently begin to accumulate on
its bones and make it rotund. There are
very few points about a Commonwealth
bank —a Bank of Australia —if it is t<> be
only a bank of half a dozen cities. The
aim should be to found a Bank of all-Aus-
tralia; to found it in the shortest possible
time; to build it profitably ; and to achieve
these results without making any needless
wreckage of old institutions. One of the
ways by which all this may be accomplished
is to purchase a large, promising, ready-
made scaffolding, outline, sketch, or impres-
sionist picture, as suggested above, and fill
in the details with Government money and
influence. If this one outline didn’t seem
sufficient, the Q.N. Bank, which somewhat
resembles the Commercial, iind has a great
hold in the North, where the Commercial is
weakest, might 'also die acquired. It is
likewise valued at a fairly low price, judged
by the Stock Exchange quotations.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
McGowen and his Dear Friend, the
Landlord.
On the very day when N.S.W. Premier
McGowen’s boom budget was published, the
tramway department had some sorrowful re-
marks to make about the Sydney trams.
They have, it is said, outgrown both the re-
sources of the power-house and the carrying
capacity of the streets, and yet they are be-
hind- —and steadily getting further behind —
the necessities of the people. A new and
greatly enlarged power-house is proposed,
and Sydney, it is declared, is also up against
an absolute necessity for constructing
hugely expensive tunnels through the city,
after the manner of the tubes to be found
in many European centres, and putting a
multitude of its tramcars below ground.
Seeing that, at busy times, as many as 400
cars dash across the intersection of George
and King streets in an hour, and that the
demand for more cars is incessant, it is
quite evident that the management is, as
it declares, about at the end of its tether.
Meanwhile, the attitude of the Government
is not especially understandable. It is
spending millions of money _ in duplicating
the railway lines, so as to bring more traffic
to a city where the wharves and the tram-
way service are equally unable to stand
the strain. It is spending millions on new
lines to further aggravate the trouble, and
the country people have not only to help to
pay for these lines, but, in many cases, to
pay freight over an absurd number of need-
less miles, so that their goods may be taken
to the needlessly remote city which has so
little room for them. Having thus bought
a lot more congestion at an immense price,
and, incidentally, by all this expenditure,
run up the cost of city land tb an incredible
figure, the Government will have to spend
more of its good loan money in buying a
lot of this dear land —buying it at the in-
flated price which it created with the pre-
vious loan money —in order to provide extra
wharfage and room for a city railway. Then
it will want another million or two for
underground tramway services. All this
money will have to be spent to accommodate
the congestion which was made by the spend-
ing of the other money. And when the Gov-
ernment has provided the new wharves, and
the railway across the city, and the two
proposed underground tramways —well, if
it keeps on building railways with borrowed
money, and making them all converge on
Sydney, it will just have to start again, and
borrow still more, and buy. up still more ex-
pensive land, and build still more wharves,
and dig out some more subterranean tram-
ways. There is no visible end to the process,
so long as it is the aim to bring all the trade
of 320,000 square miles of country —an area
nearly three times the size of England,
Scotland and Ireland —to one port.. The
especially wild jest of the business is that
all this cash is being spent by a party which;
professes to dislike private landlordism, id
order to improve the property of the private
landlords of Sydney. It might be going to
create or improve new and wholly State-
owned cities at Port Stephens and Twofold
Bay, so that, while relieving the congestion,
the State would secure the unearned incre-
ment arising out of its expenditure ; It
might—if the Government didn’t insist on
making a present of all these millions of
public cash to the rich landlords of Sydney
—go to establish a new revenue from the
ground rentals of new cities, which would
in time make it possible to cut down railway
charges by 25 or 50 per cent, or more.. The
Labor party has complained bitterly in the
past about the making of railways for the
improvement of the property of the country
landlord, who rears sheep, but it does ex-
actly the same with the property of the
city landlord, who rears bricks. Why it is
such a complete slave to the city landlord it
never explains. Its conduct in this respect
is so shamelessly contrary to its alleged prin-
ciples that it is hardly possible to devise any
feasible explanation. So it takes refuge in
deep silence, and borrows more money.
♦
The Amazing Strike.
All last week the now defunct Sydney
waterside strike grew steadily more disgrace-
ful as it dragged along towards its conclu-
sion. It was a shameful breach of faith,
and a revolt of unionists against their own
rules, their own leaders and their own
Government. It must be remembered that
the N.S.W. Arbitration Court has awarded
the men who unload deep-sea vessels 3d. per
hour more than the coastal men. To this
the coastal men object, and curious results
have arisen. First, the coastal men de-
manded another 3d. per hour, to put them
level with the deep-sea men, and got it.
Next, the deep-sea men demanded another
3d. per hour, and as the award said they
should be that much ahead of the coastal
men, they got it. So it came to pass,
a few days ago, that the coastal men tore
up their agreement, and demanded another
3d. per hour, to put them level with the
deep-sea men. And, if they got it. the deep-
sea push would presumably, and with some
show of justice, want a further 3d., to put
them ahead of the coastal men. The amaz-
ing part of the business was that, last week,
the deep-sea men also went back on their
agreement, and struck. They did it without
making any definite demand, or alleging any
grievance of their own. It is alleged
that a sudden meeting was called, in
a small hall, which could only hold
about one-tenth of the members of the union.

and that it was packed early by a violent
and excited section who voted the strike,
while the more sane section either couldn’t
get in for lack of space, or didn’t turn up
at all, having no suspicion that anything
serious was afoot. However that may be,
the whole miserable business is a bad adver-
tisement for unionism. In its beginnings, it
held up a section of unionists as men who
are not much more reliable than the
monopolist. It was a throwing of bricks
and scorn at the Arbitration principle.
It gave the Labor Government a chance
to pose either as a coward which didn’t
dare to attempt to enforce the law,
as an incanable which didn’t know
how to enforce it, or as a one-sided institu-
tion, which considers that the law doesn’t
apply as against its own supporters. The
Government had the choice of three reputa-
tions—one bad, one worse and one awful.
As for the alleged methods by which the
deep-sea men were induced to break faith
and join in a quarrel which was not their
quarrel, and which was even an absolute de-
nial of the alleged principle—their own al-
iee'od principle—that their work is of a
higher grade than that of the coastal men,
there are just two possibilities. If they
were not led into the strike by the hole-and-
corner methods which have been alleged,
then the majority of them are men whose
word is of little account. And if they were led
by these hole-and-corner methods, which
seems to have been the case, then the respon-
sibility rests only noon a small section, but
it is a worse responsibility, for that sec-
tion is evidently just as ready to work a
low-down game on its fellow-unionists as
on its enemy, and it has a disregard
for the principle of majority rale which
almost amounts to madness —or genius.
The N.S.W. Boom Budget.
Tiieke are good and dubious and bad features
about the just-delivered N.S.W. budget,
boom is its prevailing characteristic. The
strikingly good features are chiefly these.
(1) In future, the land sales receipts —or
at least 90 percent, of them, the other 10 per
cent, being regarded as cost of administra-
tion —are not to be treated as ordinary
revenue after the old wicked fashion, or
mostly as ordinary revenue alter tne
mock-reform Carbutheks fashion, but
are to be paid into the Public Works or
Closer Settlement Funds. (2) lhe net pro-
fits from public works (railways, etc.) are
not to go into revenue, but to go into the
Public Works Fund. These are two notable
reforms, assuming that the Closer Settle-
ment Fund, which is always a dilhcult soit
of thing, is properly administered, and the
money isn’t spent in paying first-rate prices
for fourth-rate soil. The most conspicuous
item which comes under the head of “dubious
is the proposal to establish a sinking fund
of 6s. Bd. per £lOO per annum for the re-
demption of the public debt.. The amount
is amazingly small, but that isn’t where the
very worst trouble comes in. _ A real sinking
fund is one into which certain amounts are
paid regularly for the abolition of a debt,
and these amounts are allowed to accumu-
late at compound interest until they overtake
the debt, however long the stern chase may
be. A bogus sinking fund, like the sort
which N.S.W. has hitherto possessed, is
simply an amount paid off the debt every
year, and the compound interest element is
wholly lacking. In the case of the real sink-
ing fund, if the country, paid in 3d. a year
against every £1 of new borrowings, the
debt would be extinguished in time —a
mighty long time. In the case of the bogus
one, though the country paid in 19s. 9d.
against every £1 borrowed, the debt would
never be extinguished —not even in eternity.
N.S.W. sinking funds have been absolutely
bogus in the past, and though McGowen’s
fnay be genuine, it would be pleasant to have
a cast-iron and boiler-metal assurance on
the point. The really bad feature of the
budget is its boom atmosphere. Premier
McGowen evidently fancies that the good
times will last for ever, and despite the fact
that the taking over of a number of depart-
mehts by the Commonwealth has relieved
the State of a great mass of expenditure—
old age pensions, defence, postal expenses
and others —the bill is rising to heroic pro-
portions. Last year, when the accounts
were kept in the old way, the revenue, in-
cluding all the (and sale money, was
£13,882,485, and the expenditure, including
£409,349, paid in reduction of debt, and
£386,153 paid to the public works and
closer settlement funds (total £795,502), was
£14,220,657, so there was a deficit of over
£300,000.' This year, including all land sale
revenue and £975,000 of new taxation, the
revenue is expected to reach the mighty
figure of £15,444.581, and the expenditure—
including £399,525 for sinking and renewal
and debt-reduction funds, and £1,039,065
for public works and closer settlement
funds (total £1,438,5t»0) —is reckoned at
£15,822,844. So there will be a deficit of
nearly £400,000. In other words, the cost
of running the State departments, the rail-
ways, etc., and the interest bill goes up in
one year from £13,425,185 to £14,384,254.
The McGowen Government anticipate col-
lecting £1,562,096 more revenue than last
year; on making £643,088 more provision
for works and contingencies; on spending
£959,069 more on running the public busi-
ness ; and on having £40.061 more shortage.
It also expects, despite all this extra revenue,
to spend £3.422,000 of borrowed money,
which will whoop up the public debt to the
noble total of £99.000,000. The whole out-
goings are to be close on £21.000,000. This
is the boom finance that gopth before a fall
in a country where the seasons are so sud-
den as in Australia. If it takes £3.422.000
of loan money to keep the allegedly reformed
Premier McGowen afloat in the best finan-
cial year N.S.W. ever saw, what is likely to
happen when times are bad owing to war or
drought, and revenue slumps, and loans are
hard to get. and some less reformed indi-
vidual than the financially. reformed
McGowen is at the head of affairs.
The Advisability of Doing the Straight
Thing.
*lO-2-4” on tactics and the like: —
N.S.W.’s Government seems to have gone cold on
the idea of appealing to the country as soon as the
electoral rolls shall have been amended and the con-
stituencies redistributed. Apparently, the thing is
largely a question of filthy but essential lucre. Six
pounds a week is a poor wage to save on, and some
of the private members are still working double
shifts to pay off expenses incurred at last elections.
The party organisation has little money, either in
hand or offering, for an immediate campaign. A
goodish sum was spent on the Referenda struggle, and
the Trades Hall people want all that is left for the
Labor daily. And so, one way and another, a lot of
pressure is being put on the Ministry to break the
sudden promise of a few months back.
There is a measure of justification for such a step.
For weeks before the recent by-elections, the Sydney
morning dailies, speaking, presumably, for Liberal-
ism ” assured Maitland and Liverpool Plains that the
sacred duty had devolved on them of voicing not
only their opinion, but that of the State, m regard
to the Government's land policy and its record gener-
ally. “These great country constituencies shall be
the judges,” declared “Liberalism.” The verdict was a
mighty Labor win in one constituency and a lament-
able failing-off of the customary huge anti-Labor vote
in the oilier constituency. In other words, Liverpool
Plains and Maitland declined to pass a vote of no-
confidence in the McGowen administration.
Furthermore, the position of parties in the As-
sembly has altered of late. Whereas the Ministry
originally went into business with a shifty majority
of two, it has now (owing to the Liverpool Plains
win, to Willis being in the Chair, and to the
prospect of at least occasional support from three or
four STOUEY-ites) a fairly solid-looking position.
As the large crowd of “Liberals” and “Democrats,”
who have unsafe seats and no hope of office, desire
nothing less than a dissolution, there is no doubt
that the present Administration could last out the
full term of Parliament, were it so disposed. The
tactical unwisdom of attempting to do so —to put it
on no higher grounds—lies in the facts that it would
damage Labor’s prestige and reputation for straight-
going, and present the ruined old armory of its
enemies with a brand-new weapon. (This would
matter more, however, if the said enemies were more
particular about their weapons; if they don’t get
this one they will invent some other, so it doesn’t
signify so very much whether they get this one or
not.) ’ Apart from the facts that the Ministry has
publicly promised a dissolution in the near future,
and that it is good business to keep promises, public
and otherwise, there is the further circumstance that
the moment the new constituencies and the new rolls
materialise, the present Assembly will automatically
cease to represent the people. There is a type of
Parliamentarian who doesn’t much mind whether
he is a genuine representative or not, so
long as he draws a representative’s wage.
He is for that peace which represents a steady
job, at any price. As regards the present position,
his argument is that Labor has to justify itself by
legislation; that this can only be done by sending
Labor measures to the Council ; and that, if the
Council rejects them on the ground that the As-
sembly ought to dissolve, it can always be “flooded.”
Some points he misses are: (1) The Council is
not going to captiously fling out obviously sound and
popular Labor measures ; it will wait till the inevit-
able unpopular one comes along; and (2) Lord
Chelmsford will think hard before he agrees to the
appointment of a big batch of Labor coun-
cillors, when the Assembly is about due to
go before the reformed constituencies, and
the betting is hundreds to one that, when he has
done thinking, he will turn the proposition down.
In that event, the party will not go to the country in
that dignified and graceful manner which is so much
of the battle, and at its own time, and on a flood
tide of popularity; it will be shoved there, so to
speak, and the unpleasantness will occur at “Liber-
alism’s” time and when Labor stock is low.
From every point of view it is up to the N. S.
Wales Government to square its jaw, and get the
verdict of the State as soon as may be.
How the Rich Landlords Betrayed John
Weary.
A session or two ago, Victoria’s House of
Rich Landlords proved so cantankerous and
obstreperous that Premier Weary, then n it
quite so worn out as he is to-day, threatened
to put up progressive candidates against
that half of its members that was about to
go up for re-election. He got no further
than the threat, for the spirit of laziness got
hold of him, and, on a sort of half promise to
behave better in future, the old obstructives
were mostly re-elected —only to prove more
reactionary than ever. One of their feats of
the penultimate session was to toss out the
Public Works Loan Application Bill, which
provided for the erection of two State cool
stores in fruit-growing centres, and one at
West Melbourne for the benefit 01 the meat
and butter export trade. These stores were
so badly needed that Weary and his Minis-
ters —especially “Agriculture” Graham —-
professed themselves very angry, and threat-
ened to do the work by executive act, or by
putting the item on the estimates, or some
other how. But tne Weary brand of anger
is shortlived, and in the session just closed
the tired person’s lieutenants once again
brought in the same old Bill —and the House
of Rich Landlords fired it out’ as before. The
record of that House last session is interest-
ing. Early in its days, it adjourned for three
weeks, apparently out of pure laziness, as
there was work before it; several times it
took control of business out of the Govern-
ment’s hands, adjourning prematurely, and
reporting progress unjustifiably; and twice
its members proved so careless and lazy that
it was counted out. The consequence was
that as the end of the session approached, a
rush of business happened, and the Rich
hypocritically complained that they were ex-
pected to put in overtime on important work,
and cast the Bills out rather than tackle
them. There was, of course, no need for
Weary to close the session before February,
1912, but he and his mates thought that by
holding the election in November, instead of
March, they would be studying the farmers
—who were naturally expected to study them
in return. And this is where the Landlords
spoiled his scheme. They either directly, or
indirectly threw overboard the Apprentices,
Melbourne Harbor Trust, Workmen’s Com-
pensation, Country Wages Boards and other
valuable Bills, the loss of which will cost
Weary many votes on the 23rd of . this
month; but these iniquities will have trifling-
results compared to their deliberate rejec-
tion —after their “suggestions” had been
thrice refused —of the measure providing for
the building of State-owned cool stores.
They played this scurvy trick on the primary
producers, in order to suit the books of the
Melbourne City Council and the owners of
private cool stores, many of whom earned
caustic criticism from the notorious But-
ter Commission. The Council’s cool stores in
Flinders-street are small and untidy, badly
situated and expensive; the private
stores are equally diminutive, badly
situated and costly ; and they suffer from a
leaning towards that honorable understand-
ing that is so good for the understander, and
so bad for the understood. The Government
proposed to spend £BO,OOO in building ade-
quate, up-to-date stores alongside dock and
rail at West Melbourne, where exported pro-
duce might be dealt with at minimum cost —
but the Rich Landlords said “No,” for the
second time. Little else could be expected
from the entrenched upholders of monopolies,
but it was a mean trick to play on Weary.
He had been very gentle with them, had
borne with them as with wilful children, had
brought in a proposal constructed solely in
the interests of their supporters,, the primary
producers, and advantageous chiefly to their
own landowning class. And now he has to
go and face all those primary producers, in
four short weeks, and tell them why he left
this important measure till the last moment,
whv he cut the session so needlessly short,
why he didn’t put the amounts on the esti-
mates when the Rich Landlords rejected, the
Bill previously, and, in short, why he is a
truckler, a loafer and a failure. It is a trifle
hard on poor Weary, but it is a splendid
chance for the Labor men to get into office
by promising the complete abolition of the
House of Rich Landlords,
The Arms Factory Bungle.
From “The Old Soldier” :
The business of defending Australia is being badly
muddled in several important details, tor example,
there is the arms factory, which has been rn its in-
cipient stage for more months than anyone can
readily reckon. To-begin with, the man sent to buy
the plant was a marine engineer—no doubt a very
good engineer, but with no special knowledge ot
gun-making. People who were not politicians would
have picked out a practical gunsmith for such a job
—even a working journeyman would have been better
than one devoid of experience. The engineer, know-
ing nothing about the manufacture of arms, was sent
on a tour of the world to pick up a knowledge of
the business. Finally, he advised a plant from a
Yankee firm of gunmakers, an affair capable only of
turning out a beggarly 15,000 rifles in a year ; and
this to arm a force certain to number over 100,000
men. So, even when the factory gets into
full blast, it will need seven years to make all the
rifles needed by Australia’s possible soldiers at the
very beginning of the invasion, if, and when, it
comes. , , . ~
It is plain then, that, if there is trouble m the
near future, we could not arm our men with the
products of our little arms factory ; and, assuming
we imported the necessary rifles to arm them in the
first instance, the factory would only just be able to
keep up the stock by replacing those worn out by
the ordinary peace practice. The modern army
rifle is worn out after it has fired (at most) 2000
shots, however much care is taken of it. And 200
shots yearly is the least a soldier ought to be made
to fire. That would give the rifle a life of 10 years
in time of peace; but if the scrap came, a good
many of those in the thick of it would fire away the
2000 rounds to which the life of the rifle is confined,
in a week, or even less. It might well happen that
a year’s output of the factory would be used up in a
very few days, since a large proportion of those in
use would be half, or more than half, worn out; but
the proportion of 15,000 yearly, or 1250 per calendar
month, could not be exceeded, on account of the
limitation of the plant.
And even now, after all the waste of time that has
occurred, it is still doubtful whether the plant can
be made to work. We are told that some supplemen-
tary machinery not supplied by the original con-
tractor, and made at Cockatoo Island, is not what it
ought to be. Who is to blame is not stated, but, in
any case, a shipload, more or less, of the original
Yankee plant is said to he still on the waiter ; the
building, etc., is not complete, and presumably Aus-
tralia, which may be caught unprepared at any
time, will have to wait perhaps years for its arms
factory. It is a queer story of hesitancy, incompe-
tence, false economy, and all the other things which
a nation regards leniently in time of peace, and
hangs its officials for when War arrives.
Fkom an Old Inhabitant :—
S. M. Herald is verv much shocked because Gov-
ernor Strickland, of Westralia, tqld a Perth aud-
ience, the other night, that Sydney was not Aus-
tralia’s front gate, hut that Fremantle was. He also
stated that Melbourne might get the required depth
for steamer berthing when the Panama Ganal sent
60,000-ton steamers to Australia, hut Sydney never
would. So the Herald has consulted what it calls
“Sydney shipping circles” about Governor Strick-
land's heresy, and the “circles” have comforted it
with the information that Fremantle harbor is only
the estuary of Swan River. That is certainly com-
forting for Fremantle. The Port of London is only the
estuary of the Thames, Liverpool of the Mersey,
Hamburg of the Elbe, New York of the Hudson, and
so on to infinity. Also, the Herald :
“The concensus of opinion in Sydney was that
Sydney is, and must continue to be, the premier
port south of the line, and the undoubted front gate
of Australia. It could accommodate the navies of
the world. When the American Fleet came here, the
big warships were anchored all Over the harbor.”
So they were, and a confoundedly tight fit, too.
It taxed the ingenuity of the harbor authorities to
find moorings for them ; and, after all, the little
Yankee fleet of 19 moderate-sized ships (the biggest
was only one-third the tonnage of a first-class At-
lantic liner) didn't represent more than a fraction
of the navies of the world. Britain has 34 warshms
bigger than that boss Yankee monster. But the
Herald has a better witness than “Shipping
Circles” in the Secretary of the Harbor Trust. Here
is his “explicit evidence”
“Sydney Harbor to-day could accommodate the
largest vessels afloat, and berth them right almost in
the heart of the city. The depth at the entrance to
the harbor is 90ft.,. and the shallowest part of the
eastern channel, at low water, is 35ft. This could
be deepened without the slightest difficulty.”
Perhaps the biggest ship afloat could get inside
Sydney Heads, but what about loading or discharg-
ing her? Could the Harbor Trust find a wharf to
accommodate a liner 700 ft. long and 80ft. broad?
Yet the 700 ft. liner is a minimum standard; as the
maximum it was passed 10 years ago. Last year, the
maximum was fixed by the launch of the White Star
liner Olympic, 8821 it. long and 92? ft. broad, and
that maximum has already been exceeded this year
by the Hamburg-American liner, Europa.
Now that the Secretary of the Harbor Trust has
spoken, it would be interesting if he would tell the
public a little more. The depth at the Heads and in
the eastern channel is not of .much immediate con-
sequence. The narrowness and crookedness of the
channel are very much more important when ships
are long and broad. No sooner does a ship get in-
side the Heads than it has to turn at right angles to
port, and dodge the Sow and Pigs. If that ob-
struction were blown up, and the fragments dredged
away, it would simplify the navigation of the port.
The same applies with still more force to Shark
Island, Clark Island, and all the other obstructions
to navigation. Whether the removal of the islands
would make the channel wide enough for safety is
a question that only experience can answer. In
every port there must be a channel kept open for
the passage of vessels, and independent of the space
required for moorings, access to wharves, etc, In
most harbors that “fairway channel” is reckoned at
about half the width from shore to shore. In the
Hudson, at New York, where the river is 4000 ft.
wide, the fairway is 2000 ft. In the Thames, at
Tilbury, it is 1600 ft. Will the Harbor Trust tell
the public what is the width of the fairway in
Sydney Harbor, if there is such a channel kept open ;
or will it admit, through its Secretary, that it can-
not, and has never so much as tried, to maintain a
fairway channel ?

A recent Plain English article in The
Bulletin, headed “Maoriland Fills ’Em
Up Again,” is just now being industriously
published in the M.L. newspapers, no doubt
with the best of intentions. Unfortunately,
since the article left this office, it has met.
with an accident whereby this dreary bit of
slush has been added on to it: —
The working classes of the Dominion cannot afford
to vote for No-license, because the loss of revenue,
totalling one million sterling, will have to be made
up, and it will fall on the worker every time. Be-
sides, if Prohibition is carried, thousands will be
thrown out of work, and will he competing with
each other for work, lowering wages. To save the
situation, you must strike out the bottom line in
each paper on election day.
The accident having now been drawn atten-
tion to, probably it will not be repeated.
An extremely mild and reasonable deputa-
tion, representing the Barbed Wire Workers’
Union, called on Customs Minister Tudor
the other day, and informed him that, owing
to the molehill duty of 15 per cent, against
fbreign, and 10 per cent, against British
vyire, their employers were unable to pay a
better average wage than 38/G a week.
Then they showed the Minister that the
Yankee manufacturer was such good friends
with his shipping brother that he could land
wire in Rockhampton, from New York,
cheaper than the Melbourne manufacturer;
also, that the uncomfortable stuff was being
sold in Australia at a cheaper rate than in
the U.S. Their bosses had promised them'
higher wages if they could beg some higher

Here they fumbled their hats and looked
weirdly expectant. Tudor then rose, and
told the extremely reasonable deputation
that he would see the duty was charged on
the home-consumption value of the wire, and
that the request for a higher duty would get
“its due consideration.” He probably meant
“its overdue consideration” ; but he preferred
to put it the other way. Filled up with
cold promise, the extremely mild makers of
metal thorns then respectfully withdrew, to

thing particular is done for them, they, at

The story that reached this country last
Tuesday filled the peanut vendor with
horror. It told how the Italians had been
shamefully licked by inferior numbers; how
they had (led in terror to the city of Tripoli
to find refuge under the guns of their ships;
and how they had gone raving mad, and
being unable to do much against armed
Turks and Arabs had got partly level by a
four days’ massacre of the local population.
Apparently, in their shame and anger they
would rather have bombarded a cat than
done without some semblance of victory.
The general in command has been super-
seded, either for inefficiency or because of
the report that he had a habit of hiding in
bomb-proof shelters. It is in a measure,
Custozza and Lissa and Adowa over again—-
not quite the unutterable smash of Adowa,
for at that tragedy there was practically no
place to retreat to, but just as certain a
defeat. Now, with its badly-crippled army
cooped up in a foul old town by the hot sea-
shore, and said to be suffering from
cholera, nerves and nightmare, Italy
can take one of two roads. It can
clear out in disgrace, it can bring up
a new army and do another gamble, trusting
to the fact that even victories are expensive,
and the Unspeakable Turk is cut off from his
reinforcements. But it is a dismal outlook,
and the ghost of Adowa sits heavily on the
aggregate Italian chest.
Suggested text (Luke xi., 21) for the
auti-Defence snufflebuster’s next sermon:—-
When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his
goods are in peace.
The appalling Wade, scoffing at a sinking
fund, says such a thing is “only justifiable
when the security or asset is being worked
out or depreciated.” The dull incom-
petent evidently doesn’t know the dif-
ference between a sinking fund and
a depreciation reserve. It is a depreci-
ation reserve that is called for to re-
place “an asset which is being worked out or
depreciated.” A sinking fund is a different
thing altogether; it is a fund to gradually
pay off a debt on anything. So when Wade
says a sinking fund is only justifiable when
the asset is disappearing, he really says a
man is never justified in owning anything,
and that he never ought to have anything
which isn’t pawned.
The two sweat ouesti'ms in Sydney, last
week, were: (1) Why did the s.s. Port Ste-
phens climb high up on the shore in calm
weather? and (2) who killed Henry Trevas-
cus? Trevascus hung out at the Glebe,
where he lived a lonesome life, and worked
or mysteriously traded in metals. Appar-
ently a man, professing to have portable
metals for sale, made an appointment with
him, and ho drew out some £5O or more, so
as to be ready to do business—at least there
are some hazy mental furnishments to that
effect. Apparently this man, or some other
man, slew Trevascus and took the £5O, or
whatever it ivas. Then one or both of them,
or else some third party, either by himself
or in collaboration with a fourth party, put
a roughly-printed notice on the door, to the
effect that Trevascus had gone to Goulburn
for a week, and thus got a long start before
the body was found. It was discovered at
last by the deceased’s daughter—a nurse—
when she came on a visit. And the
police would almost give their biggest pair
of feet to know who killed Ilenrv Trevascus.
The murderer of Bauer, the Melbourne dia-
mond merchant, is siwoected. But then, who
killed Bernard Bauer?
That brilliant financier, G. G. Wade, who
hardly knows enough about the subject to
tell one side of a shilling from the other,
talks about McGowen’s proposed mite of a
sinking fund :
The new-fangled idea of a sinking fund to reduce
the State debt... There is no need for this. A sink-
ing fund is only justifiable when the security or asset
is being worked out or depreciated. But who will
question the assertion that the railway assets of this
State are increasing in value greatly year by year?
So a sinking fund for the reduction of the
State debt is a new-fangled idea. Yet it was
Wade and Wade’s own crowd which, in 1904,
professed to introduce a sinking fund “for
the absolute reduction of the State debts.”
It is true that The Bulletin said that the
alleged sinking fund was a fake and a fraud,
and no sinking fund at all, as might have
been expected: and this paper is now glad
to have Wade's own admission to that effect
concerning his own handiwork.

After a couple of months of champagne,
the patrons of tier Majesty’s (Sydney) were
turned suddenly on to beer, and they didn’t
instantly appreciate it, although it was very
good beer indeed. Now that they have got
the remembrance of the Melba gold-top out
of their mouths, “The Chocolate Soldier” is
being judged on a proper basis, and the usual
crowded Houses are smacking their lips over
it, and mostly inviting themselves to have
another. The new musical comedy is full
of melody, aud there is a connected yarn in
it, which the humorists are not privileged
to break without fair provocation.
If you had engaged a sleeping compart-
ment for your wife and yourself, and at the
last moment found that you had to travel
alone, and met Miss Florence Young, who
hadn’t got a sleeping compartment, wander-
ing disconsolate in the corridor, wouldn’t
you have offered her your compartment, and
taken the corridor? And if you had a ham-
per, packed by your wife, wouldn’t you have
shared it with Miss Young? And, if you
had a row with the conductor, and, in going
out, he slammed the door with so much em-
phasis that the lock broke and shut you in
with the fair stranger for the night, wouldn’t
you be pardonably annoyed? And if your
wife, Miss Sybil Arundel, sued you for di-
vorce, and the case was tried by W. S.
Percy, and Miss Florence Young iooked as
pretty, as she did on Saturday night at the
Criterion, what chance would you have had ?
These are the painful circumstances that, in
“The Girl in the Train,” threaten to wreck
tin married life of Mr. W. Talleur Andrews,
and give rise to one of the most mirthful
divorce cases ever seen on the stage. But
the Dutch newspapers do not seem to have
the enterprise of a wet snail. Here was a
charming actress, a dainty wife, a Society
v “ung man, W. S. Percy showing what he
would do if he. was Premier, and a court
full of pretty girls; and the Dutch Vesper
Bloodstain merely sends one sleepy reporter
in bright golden trousers.

“The Girl in the Train” is a musical play
with a plot; it is also one of the brightest—-
if lightest—plays that have been seen in
Sydney for some time; —or even longer.
There is so little music in the divorce scene
that the fine singing by Mr. Talleur of Tosti’s
“Parted” is welcome. In him the combine
has chosen a leading tenor, not merely be-
cause he is beautiful. It is a pleasant
change. He. acts with spice, and sings with
fire, and any reflection that might have

appearance earlier in this report is hereby
absolutely withdrawn. Miss Sybil Arundel
has been dragged from the depths of panto-
mime to shine in musical,play. Her voice
is sweet, and her appearance - even sweeter.
And she gets her chance to show that she
can act. The public seizes the opportunity
to show its. liking for Miss Florence Young.
"When she is asked whether she is a popular
actress, and replies, “The public has been
very good to me,” the house, by its applause,
identifies her with her part. Though it does
seem an inconvenient place to wear a watch.
If a stranger asked her for the time, for
instance, what with these tight skirts worn
nowadays—however, she throws into the
nart of Gnnda Van der Poo all her well-
known powers of charm. Jack Cannot, also
dredged up from pantomime, shares with W.
S. Percy the riotous humor of the piece. He
is the conductor who has got “the partial
push, ’ but he has also been a Labor Deputy.
As the President of the Court, W. S. Percy
forces the fun in a way that the audience
likes, but there are so many good points
in the .character that it might safely be
played in a less emphatic key.

Johnson and Dean, two cullud pussons

kind lately seen at the Tivoli, have come
along to show how the coon lady and the

Religious Editor finds that one of his oldest
suspicions was well-founded. The average
corner man is nothing more than a blackened
sepulchre—and a sinful waste of burnt cork
at that. The white man’s imitation of the
econ cannot compare with the coon’s imita-
tion of himself. Sam Mayo, more monoton-
ous than quaint, drones some four songs

Sydney artists smell Christmas, and make
ready to season the goose, and find sauce for
the harmful, unnecessary pudding. The
scheme they have hatched came as a hint
from the Victorian side; and consists of a
permanent show, to be run on co-operative
lines, at which Australian artists are to have
a chance to exhibit their wares. All goods
will be *""rked in plain figures, and a fixed
commission will keep the exhibition commit-
tee’s pnt boiling. Julian Ashton and
Harley Griffiths have been established as a
managing committee for the first six months ;
rooms have been taken in Bligh-street, along-
side the place where the corpulent citizen
streams in for Ids Turkish bath; and Full

the representative works of the Australians
in Europe are safely packed and duly
labelled. And, finally, the door is to be
opened without any special bang on Monday.
"THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER,"
AT SYDNEY HER
MAJESTY'S.
Nadina (Winifred O'Connor) admires her
here Alexius (Noel Fleming).
“Alias Jimmy Valentine,” the new drama
at Sydney Royal, fairly scintillates with
new lights on criminology. The most dan-
gerous type of malefactor would seem to pur-
sue his nefarious trade partly in the spirit
of au artist, partly in that of a sportsman,
and partly for the joy of registering a joke
against the police. The question of sordid
gain hardly enters into the matter. “For-
gery for forgery’s sake” is the watchword of
the born cheque-manipulator. Valentine —-
the Hannibal or Victor Trumper of crime,
the malefactor who possesses the unique gift
of being able to open the newest and best of
safes with his bare hands —wins the sym-
pathy of the right-thinking in a wholesale
manner. As a matter of fact, barring the
drab, _ commercial virtues of honesty and
veracity, he has all the qualities that best
become a man. His constancy in love and
friendship, and his courage, are admirable,
likewise his manners; he adores children, and
is a person of high intelligence and charm
and so on. But he does not rely on these
stock assets to win the affection of the audi-
ence. The goodwill of the house is really
with him most when he deserves it least —for
example, throughout his superb effort of
long-distance lying in Act 3. Again, when
he is dealing with the safe, one experiences
that feeling of baffled awe which always
afflicts the mediocrity when he watches
a Master at Something of a hero,
something of a genius, but with a kink in
him, that is James and the uoper-class
criminal generally, according to the gospel
of Davenport. ,
Chamberlain’s Tablets produce a pleasant move-
ment of the bowels without any disagreeable effect.*
The story is distinguished by a cheering
absence of cant. Jimmy and his gaol pals
(being, m the nature of things, destitute of
vhat inawn a; a "'moral sense” !,, arc not
ririrasiated as reforming on religious
grounds or Life like, after the fashion of the
impostor who “testifies” at revival meetings.
The champion law-breaker abandons crime
because of a girlone of his pals follows
suit, in order to be near him ; another, be-
cause he is getting old—all fairly arguable
reasons. The heroine suffers from no delu-
sions about her lover’s character. The nnlice
officials are likely folk. Altogether, if one
can swallow the flagrant imnrobability on
which the plot is based (the idea of a notori-
ous bank-amashei- being made cashier of a
Lank, and allowed to flirt with the banker’s
pretty daughter), and is able to accept the
author’s view <of the hardened criminal’s
character, “Alias Jimmy Valentine” is a
natural and hum-in sort <ef play..

Cyril Mackay does sound work as the
burglar-hero. It is a part that demands little
more of an actor who knows his than
restraint and ease, and a pleasant anpear-
ance. William Desmond is in his element
as Doyle, the detective, and so is Gem-go
Bryant, as a flinty-hearted warder.. Fred
Cambourne’s character-sketch of an old
gaol-bird is excellent up to a point ;• it drops
fr«m realism to burlesque where tm- oldster
strikes prosperous times. Leslie Victor is
effective as ‘‘‘Red” Jocelyn,, and J. 8.. Athol-

of scorn. A species of domestic hellow-
drama precedes “Alif' etc.”, but in r r, " , <n , d

The Literary Theatre in Adelaide aroused
great expectations by an evening with Brieux
and Sudermann. The latter was all right.
“The Last Visit” Is an intense little drama,
built around the coffin of a young officer,
who, for the sake of an Unknown Lady, has
had a duel with a certain baron —and when
a novice fights a baron it Is plain suicide.
Everybody is grieving, down to little Daisy,
the landlady’s daughter, a mere child of 19.
The Lady comes in—a countess, a born fas-
cinator. Even while bewailing her lost
lover, she is instinctively trying her hand
on his friend, who stolidly keeps watch over
the dead. Finally, Daisy firmly turns her
out. “You speak as if you were the lady
of the house.” “I am !” says the child;
“the night before the duel ho married me.”
The two women were finely played by Stella
Earle (a new-comer 1 and Olive Proctor, and
the man-friend by Royston Marcus. The
Brieux “comedy” was disannointing. “The
School for Mothers-in-Law” is sheer farce,
and wants brisk acting all round, which it
did not get. The. third item of a notable
evening was a Masque—intelligently ren-
dered, but these things read better than they
work out (unless expensively mounted) on
the stage. The music was locally supplied,
by Miss Carlien Jurs.
Adelaide Royal changes merely from Ir-
ving to Irving. “Lady Frederick” is a bril-
liant comedy, on the best French lines,
everything for effect, rather than for the
life like. Its glittering artificialities are
carried off by fine acting on the part of the
principals. The season was all too short.
“Hamlet” has just come in. The Variety
houses have strong bills. West’s have been
showing W. S. Percy’s prize film (motor-
boat and motor-car details much enjoyed).
The delightful pocket-editions of men and
women who make up “Tiny Town” have
moved on to Broken Hill, the second step
in al2 months’ tour of Australia. And at
•the Exhibition Gardens the Dandies have
come in with the summer.

“Lady Frederick,” the merry widow with
a bit o’ a brogue, returned to the Melbourne
Royal on Saturday, for a 12 nights’ run.
She is bewitching as ever. Within the space
of about 20 minutes a quartette of male
persons announce their willingness to fake
all matrimonial chances with the vivacious
Irishwoman. After Lady F. has said “No”
to her young worshipper, elderly adorer, and
middle-age desirer, she murmurs “Yes” to the
same languid, lengthy cynic as before. After
Miss Irving and Stephen Ewart, for both
of whom this paper has a most unusual re-
spect, the strongest member of the cast is
Halliwell Hobbes, whose Captain Montgom-
ery is. caddish without being a cad. Some
of the minor parts are only fairly well
filled. Gilbert Porteous and Miss Nelson, as
an old sea dog and a philanthropic dress-
maker, are both inclined to overact; Miss
Violet Ley, as Lady Mereston, does nothing
but wear her dresses gracefully ; and J. P.
Wilson represents the lively Lady Fred's
brother as a young man weighed down by a
great sorrow. This time her Ladyship’s maid
is played very creditably by Miss Gwen Bur-
roughs. “Dolly’s Little Bills” is absent
without being missed.
Australia’s own Bert Levy lias gained ad-
mittance to the Opera House by way of the
stage door. Bert strolls casually into
his stage studio, wearing a straw hat
in a manner which suggests that he does
not care a damn, and whistling in a way
calculated to accentuate the impression. His
pictures he scratches on a blackened glass
slide, about Sin. in diameter; and, by means
of a tricky arrangement, in which a lantern
figures prominently, a much-magnified reflec-
tion is hurled upon the usual screen; so that
one may follow even- stroke the artist
makes. His work is slick and clever, and
he is humorous in a carefully casual manner.
The chief fault with his turn is that there
is not enough of it. Dave Samuels brimrs

“The Swiss Express,” staged at the Prin-
cess’s last Saturday, is one of those theatri-
cal punishments which are sometimes in-
dicted upon the unwary for their sins. Per-
haps the sin of Melbourne’s former blind
devotion to musical comedy—good, bad or
indifferent—lias brought this thing to pass,
for “The Swiss Express” is an antique ab-
surdity, of Erench origin, wherein the germ
of musical comedy may be detected. Long
ago it provided outlet for the eccentric
knock-about business of skilled pantomimists.
The Hanlon-Lees, the Lauri Family, the
Martinetti Troupe and similar organisa-
tions of a less enlightened age, dealt with
this eruptive farce after the manner of their
kind, and our rude forefathers laughed at
its rapid violence. Played by an unac-
countable company from modern Britain
(via Africa), its pantomime effects are
rather crude, its dialogue contemptible, its
musical items below par, and its pretence
of vivacity, in four acts, a most uncalled-for
insult to this country’s sense of humor.
There are 21 strange names on the bill.
None of their owners are worth mentioning
on their present “form,” save, perhaps, a
couple of presentable young men concerned
in a plot to prevent a stodgy bridegroom
from establishing nuptial relations with a
young bride whose personality is limited.
The lady seems hardly worth worrying
about. For a while, on Saturday, night, the
holiday visitors were “bluffed” into d'sre-
spectful silence. “The Swiss Expreso” had
been presented to them as an imported nov-
elty. and they badly needed a laugh to drown
their recollections of the Derby. When
they found the piece to be a farrago of puer-
ility. unrelieved bv any large gleams of
talent in its individual performers, the suffer-
ing auditors grew restive. Some went away
wondering what th°v bad struck. Towards
the finish, amidst the hum of profound disap-
proval. cries of “Bet!” smote the atmo-
sohere. In this, as in rnanv otlmr matters,
the voice of the People is the voice of Ttte
Bttixetin. The show at the Princess’s is
“rot.”
Lovers of bathos were disappointed with
last week’s production of “Butterfly,” at Her
Majesty’s (Melbourne). They had pleasur-
able recollections of how, in the last act, the
agonised F. B. Pinkerton used to rush into
Cho-Cho-San’s cottage and discover the lady
with her throat cut, and their mutual infant
blindfolded and vigorously waving a Yankee
flag. In the present version the kid is sent
away to play, Butterfly stabs herself, Pinker-
ton’s tenor sounds without, and, as the cur-
tain descends, the little Geisha is seen pain-
fully dragging herself across the stage in
the' direction of the warble. Art does not
lose by the change, any more than it does by
the fact that the opera, which contains a
fair amount of rather fatuous talk, is sung
in the Dago tongue. The music ranges from
pretty to beautiful; at times . approaching
very near to bosliter. Puccini avoids. the
barrel-organ effects which Verdi at times
introduces into “La Traviata” ; but lie is not
above cribbing an odd bar or two from
Arthur Sullivan. Korolewicz-Wayda, who
appeared in the name part, is well equipped
both vocally and histrionically. On the
first night she was a trifle slow m
getting away from the barrier, but,
once she found her stride, she used her
fine soprano to very good purpose. Pinker-
ton, who is, at the best, a cad, was made a
gloriously tuneful deceiver by McCormack:.
Scandiani’s clear-cut performauce of Sharp-
less deserved only a little more praise than
the earnest wmrk of Australian Buck-
man, back again in her old part of Suzuki.
On the second night of “Butterfly the sub-
stitution of Ciccolini for McCormack reduced
the value of the entertainment by 50 per
cent., and gave the most gushful critics an
excellent opportunity to modify their trans-
ports and get their second wind, so to speak.
Any time that Melba cares to restore
“Bohbme” to the* bill, Melbourne will
feel obliged. The performance, last In-
day, was wholly admirable. An allegation
that Puccini’s opera came “practically” new
to the city, must have been the utterance of
somebody who chose to forget the nights of
Bassieh, Dani and,Co. The earlier and more
melodramatic “BoMme” was good. Where
the recent production shines by comparison
-—apart from the top-notch singing of the
two principals —is in its refinement of the
style of story. And this is not to say that
the refinement is not false. The melodrama
has been polished, hut the _ Bohemian
brethren have gained nothing in interest by
this surface effect, whilst the death scene
undoubtedly has lost some of its old force.
Melba, all the same, is a very appealing
“Mimi.” As an actress, she suggests the
truth of the character, though Wealthy
appearance belies it, and, as a g *
is the sweetest young seamstress that eve
sang for her supper One asks for noth
finer in music than this partnership
and John McCormack—the tenoi bemg an
effective mummer when not seveieiy taxed.
Miss Buckman is a bright, dashing Musette,
as well as a genial, honest vocalist, and the
valuable assistance of Scandiam and tie
other men is unobtrusively given.
compliment needs to be slightly qualified as
regards the orchestra. Her Majesty s is a
difficult theatre for any orchestra to be not
too loud in. “Faust,” “Carmen and U a
Tosca” have been added (d.v.) to the Mel-
bourne repertoire this week. 10-night

on Saturday.
BEING TYPES OF HERO
AND HEROINE AS
SEEN IN “ THE
MIDNIGHT WED-
DING," AT MEL-
BOURNE KING'S.
“The Fools of Society” was uncurled at
West’s, Melbourne, last week. It is a story
of illicit love, and contains two or three
scenes, in which a lot of amorous snarring
ends in a long, wild, tremendous kiss. “Cattle,
Gold, and Oil” provides bearable, comedy of
a Yankee blend ; and “The Gambling Mania ’
affords a sermon on the evils of reckless
speculation. This week West is starring
comedian Percy’s “All for Gold,” and also
an “exclusive” item bearing on the recent
Etna eruption. This-film is entitled “Angry
Nature,” and shows that, when Nature flies
off her block, so to speak, and goes to mar-
ket, as one might put it—well, she tears her
shirt in dead earnest, and gets her hair off.
It might almost be said, without exaggera-
tion, that she flies off the handle.
A revival of “The Prince and the Beggar
Maid” is to happen at the King’s next Satur-
day. The advt. describes that ornate drama
as’ “Walter Howard at his Best,” which
truthful statement carries due weight, al-
though Walter at his best is hardly a literary
earthquaker. Meanwhile, for two more
nights, “The Midnight Wedding” is revealing
"Walter at liis second best.
Lieutenant Watkins has been sent back
to England, a disappointed man. The smash
up of his flying machine on its second at-
tempt, on Cheltenham racecourse (S.A.), has
put Douglas Mawson out of conceit with it,
and its motive-power is to be used only tor
sledge work in the Antarctic. Mawson holds
that” the risk of a flying man being dropped,
disabled in body or machine, a few leagues
of ice away from all help, is too big a
chance for explorer to take.
When N.S.W. Premier McGowen an-
nounced that he proposed to raise another
million a year by income tax and stamp
duties, E. H. Buchanan, president of the Em-
ployers’ Federation, raised the usual howl
that Socialistic enterprises had proved a
failure —and wasn’t this new taxation proot
of it! Somehow, the Fatman is most unlucky
in his official howlers. Only a dreadful
bungler would have barked at Socialistic
enterprises at this moment, because the new
taxation is to be put on to compensate for
the withdrawal of the profits of these fail
ures ” Last year the Socialistic disasters
made a profit of £728,649, after paying in-
terest and all other charges, and it is sunpiy
because the.profit from these ‘failures isnt
to be hereafter treated as revenue that the
extra taxation is called for. In short, the
Socialistic tiger turns out to be a prolifac
milch cow; and when she isn t bailed up and
milked, the Fatman . finds he has to make
good a big deficiency. Yet he insists on call-
ing her a tiger, all the same.
AT POVERTY POINT
“J.F.H.”: An interesting volume of reminis-
cences lias just been published here in London—
Mrs. Charles Calvert’s “Sixty-eight years on the
Stage ” The lady was born on the stage. She
plavecl with Charles Kean, C. V. Brooke, Barry
Sullivan and other celebrities who went to Aus-
tralia. Of Sullivan she says: “In his youth he was
an admirable actor, with line presence and a power-
ful voice, which he used from the lowest note to
the top of his compass. Every movement of his
body, every inflection of his voice,. was carefully
studied ” Yet, with great natural gifts and an in-
finite capacity for taking pains, Sullivan never
reached the top of the tree in London. Mrs. Cal-
vert guesses the reason: “lie played Hamlet at 4,>
exactly as he had played it at 28, with the same
stilted movements which had grown into a mere
mechanism.” Irv.ng’s career was in curious con-
trast to Sullivan’s. The latter had all the natural
advantages, the former none “Irving, she says,
“was not at first a success. He had peculiarities of
gait and speech against which the critics launched
all tlicir powers of depreciation and sarcasm. But
he was a scholar with refined thoughts and lottv
ideals, and he and his stage manager —who was
Calvert, the lady’s husband—“were soon on friendly
terms. They took long walks together, and many a
night did Irving accompany my husband home to
share our bit of hot supper, which usually con-
sisted of Irish stew.” Salaries were very small m
those days, and one nigat at parting, after in-
dulging in visions of hope and future triumphs m
London, Irving exclaimed to Calvert, Well, old fel-
low, perhaps the time w’ll come when we shall
have a little more than sixpence in our pockets.
It did —for Irving, anyway.
“DMR.”: “Vaudevillain’s” list (B. 26/10/’Il)
of Rickards’s brightest stars is painfully incom-
plete. It does not mention Rudinotf, the Cockney
with the foreign accent and the bird-like whistle, nor
the Martinettis, about the cleverest pantormmists
living, nor the Dartos. Some Australians whom
’Arry found, who have since become world famous
and who are missing from “ Vatulevillain s tally,
are the Modern Milo and Cruiclcshank, Albert
Whelan and Franeie Adler. Ada Reeve, a supreme
artist in her line, was one. ..of Rickards s importa-
tions. . .. ,
“Pallete Senior”: To mark its appreciation of
Melba, the Australian public is buying her a loving
cup of native gold, and if there is enough change
left ever, it is to be expended on a portrait ot the
songstress, to be hung in our National Gallery. Let
me nominate Florence Rodway as the artist. As a
pastel list she has no equal in Australia, and few
suiHiiors on earth. Miss Rodway is temperamentally
a delineator of women and children. bor several
years her work has commanded attention wherever
shown, and her exhibits, at present hanging in the
Women Painters’ Exhibition, mark an epoch in the
historv of Australian pastel. By sheer merit and in-
dustry she has compelled recdgnition in her native
land. Let one of her rewards be the commission to
do the Melba portrait.
“B.”: One Melbourne daily, in describing the first
“Melba Opera” season performanceof “Madameßutter-
fly,” squandered the butter in glorious style, observing
that “the moving drama of faith and deception went
with rare swing, its power and intensity carrying
all before it, and leaving the vast audience more
than ever impressed with the greatness of Puccini s
genius.” On the second appearance of Cho Cho ban,
when the cast was only altered by the substitution
of the weaker Ciccolini for John McCormack, the
great daily grew suddenly disillusioned, and _ threw
vitriol in almost every direction. The journal
lamented that the prima donna —the same p.d. as
before—failed to grip the true meaning of the part;
that the conductor made the tempo too fast; that
the orchestra drowned the singers’ voices; and that
several singers bumped about on the stage ‘ like so
many horses in a race.” After that, there was no-
thing more for the paper to do but complete its re-
markable reversal of form, by declaring that the
second performance was practically rotten. Instead
of saying “rotten,” it said “the wreck was total.
“C. Ockney” : I would not dispute “O.K.’s” state-
ment (B. 19/10/’ll) that “more than one of Pinero’s
young contemporaries in Henry Irving’s co. had to
leave it on account of their half-unconscious imita-
tions of the leading man,” but, I would beg leave to
doubt it. Nobody ever seemed to leave Irving s
Lyceum company, and all the male members had a
touch of the chief” about their acting. It was the
same with the Wilson Barrett crowd ; it is the same
with Beerbohm Tree’s. The young men learning
their business study the best actor they know the
one who employs them. Consciously, or uncon-
sciously, they flatter him by imitating not only his
mannerisms, but his clothes, and the way he cuts
(or neglects) his hair, and the .boss never seems to
object Henry Irving, as a matter of fact, was par-
ticularly gracious towards even his I burlesque imta-
tors and their name was legion. I don t think ne
protested more than once, and that was when Fred
Leslie bounded on to the Gaiety stage to take part in
a riotous quadrille, “made up” like the Lyceum boss
as to the head and face, but wearing the pink skirts
and ditto extremities of a ballet dancer.
“Avon”: Beerbohm-Tree’s sumptuous ‘Macbeth
has just been produced. Walkley, in the Times, is
delightfully sarcastic. The grand impression he
takes away is that Macbeth is a poet. Such beautiful
and leisurely poetry, produced at every turn; and the
whole play halts for it! Sweetly gentle, too, is
Violet Vanbrugh’s Lady Macbeth —almost as mild a
potion as Ellen Terry’s. Bourchier’s Macduff gives a
welcome bit of the rough. Basil Gill, familiar in
Australia with Barrett, is Malcolm. Will another
Macbeth arrive? Surely the rough-liewn Macready,
Phelps, Brooke, Sullivan, Creswick and Anderson
gave what Shakspeare meant, a forerunner of Rob
Roy. The puling or poultry-farming Macbeth started
with Charles Kean, and went on to Irving. By the
way, Mrs. Siddons, big and overpowering, wrote in
her diary that Lady Macbeth ought to be a little
blonde. A modern Italian writer thinks Lucrezia
Borgia was such. And the Brinvilliers marchioness
was in the same category.
Rujdyard Kipling is reported to be writing a
pantomime, for production in London at Christmas.
Some English papers express astonishment, consider-
ing it infra dig. in an author of his standing—they
evidently haven’t read his verse. Rudyard, years
ago, made a play out of his “Jungle Books,” but
he has not yet succeeded in getting a manager to
stage it.
“Snaffle”: Cyril Iveightley, the Australian, is the
hero of the new Drury Lane drama, “The Hope.”
Keightley has wrought up by steady work. He was
with Rignold, and, later, emerged in Benson’s
Shakspearians, the school of Asche and Matheson
Lang. “The Hope” is bound to come to Australia,
being an equal success with “The Whip,” and built
on similar lines. It finishes with the Derby, by real
nags—not running sideways, as in “The Whip” and
“The Winning Ticket,” but galloping right towards the
stalls, which recalls that in a long-ago Drury produc-
tion, “The Cataract of tile Ganges and Burning
Wood of Himalaya,” a cavalry horse jumped over
the footlights and planted his hoofs in the big
drum. “The Hope,” by the way, pushes into India,
too, witli a Delhi Durbar scene.
“Harrison O.”: What is the secret of the attrac-
tion which “Camille” appears to exert over great
artists? The soiled-dove drama is a weak, inartistic
outrage, full of shoddy emotionalism and cheap stage
effects; and the opera is a still larger blot upon the
artistic landscape, for there are absurdities in “Trav-
iata” which have no place in “Camille.” For in
stance, when Alfredo (whom Tilda Brune used to
address as Almond) finds his late odalisque under
somebody else’s protection in a house of dead-easv
virtue, lie hurls bank-notes and insulting epithets at
her; whereupon his male parent, who talks and
acts like a leading Method'st, strolls in and rebukes
his son in deep-chested tones. How the old boy comes
to be inside the gilded home of vice he does not
think it necessary to explain; but, presumably, he
mistook the gilded salon for a bethel. Even if one
overlooks anachronisms of this sort, “Trav'ata” is
still a tawdry thing. Its music gives no adequate
expression to anv sort of emotion. The opera is
made up of a series of tunes, most of which could be
ground out fairly well on a. hurdv-gurdy by a Dago
who had escaped out of Tripoli. Yet for some reason,
the consumptive Flossie has always been able to en-
-I'st the sympathies of big artists, such as Melba and
Bernhardt.
“Nym”: Re the poster advertising of “The Grip
of Alcohol” by a Melbourne picture showman, and
the subsequent appearance of, the same film at rival
“palaces.” It seems that only one other Melbourne
firm got the same film from the manufacturer, but
there were pirates who took advantage of the loud
advt., to revive any old picture bearing on the
derrink evil, and bill it as “The Grip” aforesaid.
The trick of one sort of show-trade is adapted to
the needs of another. The itinerant vendor of bel-
lowdrama has long been in the habit of staging a
faked-up play under a time-honored title; now the
low-down flickergrapher, following suit, gives them a
worn-out film as the newest thing in the market.
“J.F.H.” (from London) : A couple of new plays,
produced on succeeding nights—“ The Ogre,” by
Henrv Arthur Jones, and,“A Perplexed Husband,”
by Alfred Sutro—deal with precisely the same theme,
the subduing of a rebellious wife. Sutro’s is much
the better and wittier of the two. Jones shows a
great falling off —actually descends tc such a crude
and tactless device as nailing up a pair of trousers
over the mantelpiece, by way of emphasising the
husband’s determination to rule in his own house.
Both have a good deal of talkee-talkee about the
feminist movement and the rights of women. Ihe
young lady typist is also prominent. George Alex-
ander runs the Jones production, and Gerald du
Maurier is in charge of Sutro's.
New York has revived “Noah’s Flood,” a “moral-
ity” plav, about 200 years older than “Everyman.
It is shown as N’Yark thinks it used to be given in
an English market-place, the strolling players and
their dog-kennel of an ark occupying only a bit ot
space in the middle of the stage. Mrs. Noah is a
shrewish character, played bv a man, and belabored
by the patriarch with a stuffed club for cornic relief.
The Deity has a good part. He looks through a
cupola on top of the ark, and has a gold face and
silver whiskers !
Sergeant Jeffes, of the Sydney police,
whose death was caused last week by a tram
accident, was senior-constable at Bota,ny
when the notorious Louisa Collins poisoning
cases occurred. Collins, the husband, had a
sickness which struck Jeffes as being wonder-
fully like the malady to which Mrs. Collinses
first husband succumbed; and Mrs. Coinns s
habit of having husbands who sickened m
the same way led Jeffes to sniff around
quietly for poison. He found it, and JN. S.
Wales had another hanging.
John Lysaght, Ltd., the big. galvanising
and wire-netting co., has just
capital from £700,000 to £1.000,000, and
IT R. Lysaght, the Australian representa-
tive, explains why. “At Scunthorpe they
were erecting steelworks because it was not
considered desirable to entirely depend upon
outside sources for the steel bars, necessary
for steel manufacture.” That is Private
Enterprise’s own opinion of Private Lntei-
nrise- yet when a Labor Government pro-
poses’ to follow the lead of Private Enter-
prise, and get a coal-mine or two to supply
its railways, and a brickworks to supply
its public buildings, and a quarry to supply
some of its road ballast, the same Private
Enterprise yells “Socialism. and calls the
o-ods to witness that the Government is pos-
sessed of 40 gibbering devils.

WINES
Melbourne raised a fine crop of bigamists
last month; but only one sample was-worth
preserving. This gentleman said that,
while dwelling with his first wite, he had
been blown out to sea in a small boat.
Shortly afterwards, a body was recovered;
and this body having been duly identified as
his own, he was inquested. and declared
legally dead. As a matter of fact, the article
found wasn't him ; but that mere detail, he
argued, shouldn’t be allowed to deprive him
of the right to take a new name, and make
a fresh start in life, said start including a
new wife and family. Seeing that the Law
is a whale for upholding its previous deci-
sions, this proposition might have been argu-
able if the man had had the means to nay
for the argument. But, as he hadn’t, Mad-
den declined to see the joke, and sawed him
off a sentence of 12 months. . .
Humored that the old Oceanic service—
the Yankee steamship co., whose stewards
used to treat the mere passenger like a man
and a brother, not to say a dependent —in-
tends to reconstruct shortly. The idea is
that the Ventura and Sonoma are to be
fitted up with oil fuel, and sent forth in the
old marine trail once more. They have
both been lying idle since they took their
discharge from the Australian run in 190(>,
but it is reckoned that the installation of
the oil-burning arrangement will reduce the
cost of working by 4U per cent. This is
estimated on the saving made on a similar
fitting up of the Sierra, winch is now on
the Honolulu run. Although the steamers
were built back in 1901, the owners figure
out that the oil tanks will give them a
steaming radius of 10.000 to 11,000 miles,
and that they will be able to hit up the
pace to something like 15 knots. The co.
alleges that the ships will only take
up the old ’Frisco-Australia service if the
U.S. Government digs down in its breeches
pocket and antes up a solid subsidy; but
that may be mere coyness on the co.’s part.
One certainly is that the subsidy won’t be
forthcoming from anywhere else. While the
Yankee co. was hesitating, the Union
Steamship Co. sprang forward last week, and
announced that its steamer, the Tahita,
would start a Sydney-’Frisco service on
December 9 next. Any Australian subsidy-
money that is going will certainly be handed
to the M.L. Co.
Sydney D.T., of 3/11/Tl, humorously de-
voted two columns to a special article, which
pointed out that Australian shippers robbed
themselves of something under half a million
a year by blindly consigning everything to
Jjondon, as if that overgrown place was
the only distributing centre in England. The
representative of one of the privately-owned
British railways remarked on the same fool-
ishness a year or so back. He called the
attention of shippers to the fact that the
way they did things, frozen meat bound
for the north of England, say, had to be
unloaded at the London docks, subjected to
a lot of unnecessary handling, and railed the
last step of the long journey at considerable
expense. The puzzled stranger wanted to
know why the stuff was not sent to Hull by
steamer, and left adjacent to the butcher.
He did not know that he was up against
the One Deep Port habit of mind. The com-
mercial person in this part of the globe has
evidently come to look upon England as a
sort of larger Ma State; at any rate, he has
been trading in a dull, mechanical way on
that system, and thrown away a heap of
good money.
SO OLD-FASHIONED.
HE: “Bai Jove, that was Mrs. Bryer, lookin'
prettier than ever. It's ares since I saw
her. Wasn't there some scandal a cut her .”
SHE : “ Yes, She married for love."
THE OTHER MAN'S MERMAID.
SHE : “Do you believe in latonic affection? ”
HE: ‘ Oh, yes, it's a good thing to begin with."
Dapper Davey, Mayor of Melbourne, is
hitting up a movement to provide more .
monuments for deceased S’African contin-
genters, “as an incentive to: the rising gen-
eration, and to Victoria’s future sons, to
emulate, if occasion should arise, that
patriotism which was so prominently dis-
played by those to whom reference is now
made.”
The poor man fights the rich man’s fight,
And falls a hero, as is right.
The rich man makes the earth his own,
And gives the Warrior —a stone.

“Oyez” : The Law has been giving the poor
old Crown in iN.S.W. some more Sam
McYea. A few days ago a train reached
Homebush with a consignment of
sheep, but, owing to the class of
truck used for their carriage and
the length of time on the congested
journey, a number of the wool-
growers were dreadfully damaged
when they reached their destination
at 2 a.m. one morning. The
drover who met the train collected
the dead, the dying, the halt, the
lame, the mostly-wliole and the
remainder, and, when the Crown
saw the collection, it was horrified.
There and then it decided to take
such action as would put a stop to
the sufferings inflicted upon dumb
animals on its congested rail-
ways, so it rushed the drover
round to one of its vwagistrates
and demanded retribution. The
magistrate didn’t see the point,
so lie pushed the Grown on one
side, as if it were an old imbecile,
and went on with his work. The
Crown, however, hung on to the
bewildered drover, and ran him
into the superior court, while it
argued the obtuseness of the magis-
trate. When it had sat down
breathless, the Judge reached for
his quill pen, and wrote on his
notes : “This sort of thing gives, me
the needle. I can come to no
other conclusion than that I must
dismiss the casealso. I must
order the Crown to pay the costs.”
Anyhow, that’s about what it came
to; and, after the Crown had been
advised that it was its own duty
to look after the sheep in its own
charge, on its own railways, it
went away more on an angle than
ever. But it is an incurable old
person, and may be expected round
with another folly at an early
date.
Sydney's overloaded trams have got to the
point at which they carry well over half a
million passengers a day as an average for
every day of the year. Last year's average
was 542,000. And that doesn't include the
lines that crawl over the hills on the north
side of the Harbor, or any of the outer-
suburban lines that are not directly hitched
on to the main city system. Almost every
street that runs lengthways through the
narrow tongue of land on which the city is
built carries a . tram-line or two, and the
tramway people report that the loads are
already just as much as the lines can bear.
Yet the loads keep on growing and the cars
accommodate them by the simple but deadly
process of allowing an extra few people to
crowd on to the footboards. But the capa-
city of the footboards has a limit somewhere,
and when that has been reached —well, the
Department doesn’t seem to have anything
to suggest. An underground system is in-
evitable, but even if it were started now, it
couldn’t be completed for four or five years,
and in the past five years the Sydney tram
traffic has grown from 125,000,000 to
197,000,000. Yet, instead of pushing on
with the tube, and relieving the streets of
the millions that now pour out on to the
ant-hill at the southern end of the city, the
Government proposes to spend the money in
“completing” the “central” railway station
which, so far from being central, is merely
on the edge of things, a mile or so from the
Post Office. The present idea is to spend
about £175,000 on the bricks and mortar:
and when that much has been spent, and
another £lOO,OOO on top of it, the human
ant-heap will still be as far as ever from the
shop or office where it earns its tucker, and
the capacity of the overloaded footboards
won't be increased by so much as one cater-
pillar.

THE WOMEN’S VOTE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An important feature at these elections will be the
exercise of the women’s vote, and, on the whole, it is
likely to favor the Liberal cause.— S. M. Herald, on
Victorian elections.
The I.ib’ral candidate is armed with cakes and cups
of tea ;
llis legions fight in Paris hats, and rush amazingly
Around the streets in motor-cars that grunt like
angry hogs ;
The villas sniff their oily fumes, and hear their
grating cogs ;
They stink and shake before the doors of small
suburban fry,
And whirl them off to hear about the busted Mar-
riage Tie ;
To talk to Mrs. Petrol-Smith, and envy her fine rags,
While Bosh, the well-curled candidate, gets off the
ancient gags.
Bosh puts much oil upon his hair and more upon
his tongue;
lie treats unmarried Fifty-Three as if she were quite
young,
And talks about the same old Tie in reverential
tones,
Hinting it is the long-stalked prey of Caucus bond-
man Jones.
Jones is a Socialist, of course, who wants to burst
and break.
(His photo looks quite mild, but then he never
hands round cake,
Or smiles and purrs at “Afternoons.” He has to
work all day,
And shout at night on corner lots in Labor’s vulgar
way.)
Plain Jones, with flare-lamps round his cart, plead-
ing for people’s votes,
Looks to the passing ass like one who yearns to slit
some throats ;
He stands amidst the leaping flames, above the list’-
ning mob,
An evil, unknown silhouette —the Demon on the job !
The whispered words of well-groomed Bosh, who
works when it is light,
Weigh heavily against this Jones who only works at
night;
The speech of Jones is hashed up by the tramcars
rushing by ;
The ass decides he’s just the type to bust the Mar-
riage Tie.
Jones has no faithful daily rag to dog him night by
night,
And print and spread his speeches round before next
morning’s light;
Reporters hang on Bosh’s words, and mark in
(Cheers) (Applause) ;
A paragraph is all that goes to Jones and Jones’s
cause.
Compressed and salted in the “news,” the leaders
give him fits —
“Tear off his mask,” “Explode his fads,” and blow
him into bits;
His. mutilated statements lie like corpses in the
sheet,
And —he is left explaining at the corner of the
street!
The old maid takes the paper’s word that Jones is
full of guile ;
She secs his flamelit silhouette —she thinks of Bosh’s
smile;
She tastes again the lovely cake served round by
Bosh’s cats ;
She smells once more the motor-cars, and secs the
Paris hats ;
The purr of Mrs. Petrol-Smith she thinks of with
delight.
Then once again her mind returns to Jones —who
yells by night,
And wants to bust the Marriage Tie, and o’er its
fragments gloat!
Yes, yes, of course! Dear Mister Bosh shall have her
woman’s vote !

while back, Zillah Carr, of Dandenong
(' ic.), acted as housekeeper for an elderly
storekeeper of Darlimurla, named Oxen-
bury. Oxenbury’s son, Leslie, had a lonely
awa - v back in the ranges. Now
(r. ah was, as the Scriptures would put it,
f air l°ok upon, and son Leslie, visiting
tus lather, perceived this, and decided that
f would like her to wife. But his love was
at *'* le . Sl l ent sort, and he dallied many years.
Aleantime, Zillah had become engaged to
Liarry Reedy, of Dandenong, and was to
have married him at the end of October.
Learning this in September, the lonely
larmer, according to the detectives’ yarn,
concluded that, with Reedy out of the way,
the girl might yet be his. So he trained to
Dandenong, and took Reedy, for a drive.
Subsequently, some travellers found Reedy’s
hat, and, after that, Reedy himself—with
two bullets in him. It was not till some
time afterwards that suspicion fell on Oxen-
bury, and even when there was no alternative
but to accuse him, the evidence was so
slight, and his alibi looked so effective that
on l. v ,the result of a two hours’ application of
the ‘third degree” gave the ’tecs any justi-
fication for arresting him. They say lie
“confessed” ; on the other hand, it seems
that he pleads not guilty, so there is appar-
ently still a lot of argument ahead before
the mystery is cleared up—if it ever is
cleared up.

“David .Tones” speaks from among the
kelp :
The N.S.W. Shipwreck Relief Society,, wh'ch suns
itself under regal -patronage bv affixing tiie word
“Royal” to its title, has just now a golden oppor-
tunity to prove to the public that it really is a re-
lief society—or, I should say, it had the opportunity
when the coasters Rosedale and Macleay were
wrecked recently. By those two misfortunes, a large
number of people were left destitute, yet we have
the remarkable announcement that the society could
do little but relieve pressing cases. This, in face
of the fact that the public has been subscribing to
the relief fulid - for arid that, until lately,
wrecks involving loss of life have been,scarce. The
society has an office with a big brass plate, a paid
secretary On a good salary, and an influential com-
mittee; but : brie of the things it doesn’t appear to
have is ah audited balance-sheet for public informa-
tion. At least, this deponent has never succeeded in
seeing a detailed profit and loss account. Speaking
for myself, I would be captivated to meet face to
face' it frill statement of the society’s financial stand-
ings, showipg receipts and expenditure, especially
the yratfo of the latter to relief afforded. Until
I see This, even the affix “Royal” won’t allay what
I’ll ball lhv curiosity.
Victoria’s Minister of Labor, who loves
work as little as any man, has collided with
a Wages Board and various other parties,
and is pondering what to do and how to do
it. The Board fixed the minimum wage of
adult pastry-cooks at £2 10s. per weejf,
whether the employee be male or female;
This prodded up one particular caterer, who
has employed women only for 30 years. He
says he’ll have to sack the females and em-
ploy men unless the Board fixes a separate
and lower minimum for women cooks. The
Board has refused, on the ground that if .a
woman does a man’s work she is worth his
wages; and, anyhow, she would be better
engaged at home pastry-cooking for the old
man while he attends to the public. The
Board, of course, is right, but the caterer
is persistent, and the women don’t want to
be sacked, and Weary hates disputes and
argument, and wishes they would settle
their own squabbles and leave him in peace.
Besides, he is engaged in a much weightier
discussion with the electors.

ARDENT SUITOR: “ Look at me—six foot, 13 stone, and never an ailment. You mustn't
refuse me. It would be most unscientific. We cannot go on throwing physique

What a spick-and-span world this would
be’if everyone was as methodical as Henry
Stendon, of Melbourne, deceased 1 Henry
stepped smartly down to the South Wharf
of the Yairra, the other morning, carrying
two bricks, a bag and a piece of cord, and
sat on the edge with his legs dangling over
tfie, water, immediately opposite the police
station. Several, disengaged constables
watched him as he tied the bricks in a bag
and made a running noose on the other end
of the cord. Possibly they thought he was
about to drown a kitten, or fish for compli-
ments or something ; but when; on the sug-
gestion of one extra-bright intellect, they
ambled across to interview him, Henry
placed the noose over his head and slid into
the water. They got him out 10 minutes
later, but, by that time, he had ceased to
have any use for himself.
Port Phillip is a spacious place, where a
ship has to get over the. horizon before it
reaches the Heads. It is a vast, shelterless sea
paddock, where the periodical gale whips up
an ugly sea in record time. Every now and
then, a well-found yacht is overwhelmed by
it, and the experienced yachtsman would
just as soon be outside during a bad blow.
The big excursion steamers get slammed
about in vigorous fashion at times; but
something of a record was put up last
Wednesday, when the steamer Meeinderry
was reported missing inside the harbor, and
a tug sent out in search. However, the
Meeinderry was not wrecked. Late at
night the battered craft blew up the Yarra,
and tied its carcase wearily to its dam
berth. It had survived the perils of Vic-
toria’s one uncomfortable port.

The story of a Cup of long ago. A .citizen
of good Collins-street standing, tells of the
time when ,he taught in a Sunday-school,
aiffl took a ticket ifi one of Miller’s
sweeps. His partner in the un-
godly speculation was a dear
brother laborer in the vineyard,
and, lo! their ticket drew first
prize, worth £lBOO. The day fol-
lowing the Cup was the occasion
of the annual Sunday-school pic-
nic, and the historian tells how
happy he was when he took his
place in the van, dreaming of the
money he would collect on the
morrow. His partner, at the last
moment, backed out of the picnic,
and suggested that he had better
go at once to gather in the £lBOO.
So the ticket was entrusted to him,
with a memo, authorising him to
get the prize, and that was the
last his confiding friend ever saw of
.Tosiah. The good young man presumably
fled to foreign parts with all the £lBOO.
Moral: Put-not your trust in Sunday-school
teachers, and gamble not, lest ye be welshed.

The Religious Editor: The small silver
coin which looks, in its old age, like the
burnished roof, of a large tack, and which
only can be exchanged for three battered
pennies, or six sticky halfpennies, is causing
a lot of unnecessary confusion just now. The
wharf laborers) strike, which has been hold-
ing! up-business in Sydney, and the London
taxi drivers’ strike are both understood to be
raging over, of around the small, bright in-
habitant of'beer counters and church plates.
The thr.eepenny-bit is am, elusive, insignifi-
cant and unsociable bit of metal. It will
only buy one drink in the cheapest bar. and
its tinny tinkle?) stings the ear of the parson.
Drunks refuse' it with scorn or accept it
sneeringly; and teetotal holy men grow
purple in the face denouncing it. The most
embittered foe of the coin I ever met was a
stout, old volunteer church collector who used
to stand in the central aisle of a big church
aud bar the way .of anyone who attempted
t 6 get into the front seats for less than six-
pence. .When a new chum deposited a worn
tack roof on his collecting implement, he
used to go on as if he had been presented
with a dead rat.
Maoriland is making a creditable start
with the nationalisation of water power for
the production of electricity. Progress is
being made with the carriage of the waters
of Hake Coleridge into the Rakaia river,
south of Christchurch, where a power sta-
tion will develop up to 10,000 li.p. for distri-
bution, as well as for the electrification of
the Christchurch-Lyttelton railway. Wairua
Falls, north of Auckland-, and Lake Wai-
kare-Moana, in Ilawkes Bay, are to be put
in the traces next. Tasmania has a some-
what similar idea, but there a syndicate
gets the water power. Syndicates get every-
thing in Tasmania. That is why there is
nothing left for Tasmania.
The local opponents of what they insist on
calling “conscription” are fond of pointing
to Britain’s Territorial Army, as an example
of the best of all ways of defending a coun-
try. Apart from the fact that Earl Roberts,
and most of the other practical warriors,
frankly distrust the Territorials, and call in-
sistently for compulsory service, bricks like
the following, which is from Colonel Reping-
ton’s report on the First East Anglian
Field Artillery Brigade, as seen in camp
the other day, are continually striking the
upuolder of the voluntary system:—
A sorrier show than this brigade presented the
writer hopes never to see. There were some useful
riding horses on parade, but the gun-bearers weren’t
fit for a knacker s yard. A more miserable lot of
scarecrows could not be imagined. With much diffi-
cultv the batteries crawled out of camp after think-
ing over the matter for three days, but the teams
were quite unable to move in any order off the high
road. The men seemed to be very badly trained, and
not a single manoeuvre was passably carried out.
All that can be said about the brigade is that the
enemy will be in London before the Norfolk Field

If , a missile of that .description impinged a
brigade in one ot those countries where they
take their land defence seriously, someone in
authority would probably be shot.
There are enough live ships in Sydney
Harbor to seriously inconvenience business ;
but. last Wednesday, the tug Champion,
while dragging two windjammers past Brad-
ley’s Head, caught the slack towing line in
the remains of the collier Currajong, sunk
in a collision with the Wyreema last year.
Both tows had to anchor in a hurry, while
the Champion made unsuccessful efforts to
unleash itself. The Currajong is supposed
to be well below the keels of deep-draughted
tramps ; but some mariners think the wreck
may have shifted its position, and would like
the Harbor Trust to have a look round the
burial place to make sure. It is very awk-
ward when even the dead ships stir in then-
graves and get in the road.
One G. Ambrose, of Kogarali (N.S.W.).
has devised a new kind of railway car, with
a high-speed motor in the centre and a de-
vice for adjusting the vehicle to the break of
gauge. He claims that his new train can
scoot from Sydney to Melbourne in 12 hours,
and that the change at Albury from the 4ft.
84in. to the sft. 3in. gauge won’t delay it for
a” minute. His trouble, he says, is that he
can’t even get. the great railway panjan-
drums to look at it, though an invention with
such claims behind it, and presented by a
man who hasn’t the earmarks of a lunatic,
certainly calls for inspection. In this respect,
Ambrose is practically in the same boat with
Brennan, of the gyroscope and the mono-
rail, and with the men who want _ to build
electric railways. Apropos the habit, which
so many great railway potentates have, of
fleeing into a cave and banging the door
when invited to get out of the rut, a one-
time Australian railway commissioner, who
had just refused to so much as look at a new
device, gave this explanation : “As long as 1
stick to the old ways, I am safe; but if I
take up new things, and they happen to be a
failure, I get a reputation as an engineering
crank; and that reputation will stick to me
ail my life.” Thus the old two-rail line, and
the old steam loco, with the shovel-full of
burning coals in its stomach, have become as
stereotyped as the R.C. church used to be
and it will take an engineering Luther to
shift them.
Thus a Maoriland paper:—
The programme was an unusually strong one, com-
promising the names of some of our most talented
local artistes.
THE CURSE OF TUB LICEITY.
HE: “ Wouldn'tyou like to be famous?"
SHE: “Oh, no! I'd hate to have my birthday
a matter of history .”
The worker is never satisfied. At Not-
tingham (England) the worra-gatlierers
(people who collect worms to be drowned by
amateur fishermen) used to get.2s. per 1000
worms. And, being a base insurrectionary
crowd, they revolted, with the result that
they now receive 2s. 6d. per 1000 for inferior
or moderate worms, and 3s. for the best
worms. As for the worms, they get nothing
except a lingering death.
THE PEACEMAKERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Says a prominent member of the Baptist Union:
“The best way to prevent war is to prepare for
peace.”
Japan prepares to spend £40,000,000 on its navy.
While other countries build their ships,
And forge their thunder-making guns,
Let only peace be on our lips,
And peaceful works employ our sons.
Our powder-making task must cease.
This is the way we may increase
The Baptist’s guarantee of peace.
The cruiser perfect peace forbids,
And ours we’ll turn to trading ships,
Or use them to indulge the kids
In little, holy picnic trips.
We’ll smash our rifles by the score,
Of shells we’ll keep no horrid store,
And so avert the pangs of war.
So much is made as clear as mud,
And hereby wider truths are learnt —
That, to prevent another flood,
All brown umbrellas must be burnt;
That if you do not stand, but crawl,
You’re in no danger of a fall,
You cannot be knocked down at all.
We must not have the .arms to fight,
Nor to our wicked riches cling,
Nor in our homesteads take delight,
Nor cherish wife, nor anything
Our envious foemen could divide.
He who’d with perfect peace abide
Can’t possibly have aught beside.

LINKINO THE FORCES.
• • Rather a good suggestion,” was the
comment of the Minister of Defence
yesterday upon an idea presented to
him by a senior chaplain of the military
forces. It was that chaplains should
identify themselves with the cadet sys-
tem by attending parades in their dis-
tricts, and occasionally talking to the
boys during rest periods. Senator.
Pearce stpted that the Department
would be pleased if chaplains would
consider it their duty to do this, but
I the talks or lectures must, of course, be
V restricted to such subjects as the duty
of citizenship and the development of
I I soldierly qualities of discipline, courage
and self-respect. Religious subjects
I will not be mentioned.

“M.Y .” : Swamp reeds, nominated by an
Abo. writer for the deep-rooting prize, are not in it
with lucerne. On the Hunter River that vegetable
digs its toes down to the' drift, 40ft. or more. And
the Darling pea can do even better than that. I
myself have followed pea roots, when well-sinking in
black soil flats (Inverell, N.S.W.), to the basalt, 50ft.

Macintyre River flats), and know of 64ft. of soil
with pea roots all the way to the basalt, .for a sur-

face all the way.

MRS. FAT SIN: “ Gam! What d'yer think I

Dear Bulletin, — Excuse the brevity of
my greeting, as I’m in a helluvaurry to get my
pegs in before some other inky vulture swoops down
on the pitch. I was hustling my old shack into
condition for the quarterly inspee., and, at one
stage of the performance, the hammer I was using
crashed through the paint as if it were driving
through a withered bladder. When the atmosphere
had closed again over the hiatus blown into it by
the breath of profanity, an idea fell out of the hole
in the wall, and bumped into the grey matter of my
sensorium. What about calling the first Australian-
built destroyer the White Ant? Apart from the
eminently BuLLETin-ish flavor of the central portion
of the name, does anyone know of a more effective,
or silent, “destroyer” than the fat little termite?
If anyone does, I’ll forfeit my patent right to bap-
tise destroyers, and propose “Knotty Pine” as a
name for the first Australian-built battleship.
Knotty Pine is a product which grows, and is ex-
tensively used for fencing and building purposes,
pretty well all over the Lachlan and Riverina count-
try. If any Abo-hog, or any other hog, knows of a
case where the white ant destroyers have successfully
tackled a construction bearing the sign manual of
knotty pine, I’d like to hear him grunt. Yours, etc.,
F. De Mutt.
“F.C.”: The Weary Government has been
holding an egg-laying competition at the Burn *
(Vic.) Horticultural Gardens, for the iast five
months, and proposes to continue the unseemly pro
ceeding for another seven; also, my daily paper
regularlv informs me that so many eggs have been
laid during the past week, and that Bosh s pen
is still in the lead ; further, that the leading “pens’
are all white Leghorns. The information is further
vouchsafed that the Government has spent some £lOOO
directly on the competition, and I don’t know how
much indirectly. Now, what is the use of all this?
Pretty nearly everyone knows that the well-regulated
white Leghorn lays one egg every week day, and
rests herself on the Sabbath of the Lord; that she
eats in moderation, and spends the rest of her time
scratching up the garden or balancing herself on a
stick. She does not propagate her species to any
extent, inasmuch as she will not “sit” or cluck
some other fowl or weapon has to be engaged to
“cluck” for her. These facts being already notorious,
why does the State waste the time of several pre-
sumably valuable servants on proving the obvious?
The white Leghorn has been laying her egg a day,
and making an undue fuss about it, ever
since Noah foolishly took her and her mate
into * his floating zoo; and she ought to be
thoroughly ashamed of her lack of progress.
What this progressive country wants is a hen
or rooster that will lay eight or ten eggs per day,
without crowing over it, and will scratch for her
own tucker. Roughly, these 500 fowls that this
Department of State is looking after yield a net
profit of less than a halfpenny a day apiece, and the
_ imi t worth the cackle.
* * * *
“Warradulla”: I tumble headlong out of
my nija-mia to utter a ferocious protest against
“Pick’s” remarks (B. 21/9/’ll) regarding the emu’s
breeding habits. He says that Mrs. E., if an egg
is taken from her bedroom daily, will keep on laying
throughout the season in order to make up the regula-
tion four for hatching purposes. If “Pick” had ever
been in the bush he would know that the emu lays
no specified number of eggs, but anything from two
to 10. It is quite common to meet the lady per-
ambulating eight or nine babies. This, as I say,
is in the bush. I don’t know what the emu does in
the circus, because I’m not in the circus business.
* * * *
“Condamine” : I have known covered fires
and smouldering tree-roots to keep alight for three
months, but, for a clean burn-out in the open, I
nominate the belah-oak for the long-while cham-
pionship. A solid log of this timber—dead—will
in calm weather bum like a huge cigar, with sev-
eral inches of clean, white ash, departing at the
rate of about Bin. a day. I have known a 50ft. log
to burn for nine weeks ; and during that time three
inches of rain was recorded.
“Agricola” : The old gibe about the cocky’s
mania • for destroying the native • flora unnecessarily
will soon be undeserved.
Cocky is beginning to spare
as many as he can of the
ornamental trees, such as
pine, cherry and wattle.
With regard to the wattle,
there is much to be said in
excuse ,for. the cocky. Most
varieties of the golden glory
are short-lived, and, though
very soon after the death of
a tree, numbers of seedlings
spring up round the corpse,
the rabbits and other stock
chew them up .when the
grass runs low in the cup-
board. It is rather much
to expect the cocky t o
erect guards around hip
nursery, though I know of
one, who, , after building
himself a mansion of cement
blocks, carted opt the empty
cement casks, and fitted
them oyer a corresponding
number ,pf young wattles.-
In the near future,-. !• expect
to enjoy, ,in that paddock,
an idyll in green and gold
binding,, running- to .some
70 stanzas. Another cocky,
whose holding of some 2000.
acres is blessed with a large
number of hollow stumps,,
has glorified them b.v plant-
ing a wattle in , each ; and
those hollow stumps ta k e
some b eat i n g a s •tr e e
guards, besides providing
the finest of plant- food for
the seedlings. A 40-bushel
crop is all the harm I wish
these' two cockies next har-
vest.
“Agricola”: I want “Condamine’s” ad-
dress. He is tlie individual who advised me to evict
a community of meat ants, which occupied a desir-
able residential site on my estate. Following his
directions, I plugged up all the holes in the nest, bar
one, with mud. Procuring a funnel, I’ emptied a
pint of the evil-smelling chemical down the vacant
orifice, plugged it, and waited for the fumes to
meander through the galleries of the nest. Then I
withdrew the plug and applied a match. When the
volcano subsided I found my 25-bob pants were
practically ruined, and my ears, eyes and hair were
full of squashed ants and assorted debris. But it
evicted the colony all right. What was left of them
departed in a body for a new site, and they found it
10ft. to the left of the old one. I’m engaged at pre-
sent in filling up the hole I occasioned in my pro-
perty, and when I’ve finished I’ll be ready for “Con-
damine’s” address. The dog is loaded.
Hitherto the white ant has been under-
stood to confine his attentions to timber, and
only the softer varieties of that; but a section of
the lead-piping enclosing one of Adelaide’s under-
ground telephone cables, lately sent*for the P.M.G.’s
inspection, shows that the beastie has now taken to
dining off the metal, and had in places eaten- the pipe
—an eighth of an inch thick—right through. As
the Department is at a loss what to do, the pest will
apparently have to keep right on till it reaches the
copper wires, where a sizeable shock awaits it. Pos-
sibly, however, a charge of electricity will only urge
it on to further efforts, the white ant being a tough
proposition, and not easily discouraged.

some inquiries amongst the talent. This is the

“Locust”: I would like to accept “Jimmie
Pannikin’s” assurance that the Austral hoy has
changed since our time, but I can’t. The catapult
may have disappeared ; but the “civic sense” is not
yet developed as it has been in other
countries. The Australian city child still peels the
banana or orange, and leaves a trail of peelings
behind him on the footpath as he goes, on carelessly.
The only " way the Austral boy deals with a letter
or a paper is to tear it up and strew it in the
streets; and in the country the, orthodox way. of
disposing of a dead animal is to throw it in the.
nearest creek. Gonsequently, the Gundagai kiddies,
who wait till the grapes are ripe before they
despoil the vines, are to me sources of wonder and
admiration. In New York the slum kiddies collect
the debris thrown about in their neighborhood, and
have song drill to impress it upon them. Can “J.P.”
let us know whether civic sentiment is taught in
any of the schools under our system ? Children
ought certainly, in town or country, to be trained
to civic tidiness, and given some inkling that it is
wrong to tear up papers and strew them in the
street for someone else to pick up, or to throw a
dead dog or pig in a running stream, to poison
fellow creatures lower down.
THE WHISKY DEMOCRAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ilis everyday manner is chilly enough,
The commons who labor he looks on with scorn,
The battler in bluchers he brands as a tough,
And never a Bill need approach him with “Morn’!”
I>ut when there is whisky at midnight, and speeches,
And three cheers, and joy at the looniest jest,
The h%nd of affection to Plain Bill he reaches —-
It s love-one-another, and Bill-is-my-brother,
And Tom, Dick and Harry may lean on his chest..
'then, Bill is his brother, and “one of the best.”
Although, as a rule, as a touch-me-not chap,
He goes his exclusive, immaculate way
His dignity buckles with whisky on tap,
When whisky is plenty and everything’s gay.
By new, noble impulses then is he guided,
He feels like a man when he’s taken his fill,
And starts, in a burst of excessive, lopsided
Affection to smother, sweet William, his brother. . .
He 11 shake with both hands to show his goodwill
For William, his brother—his dear bruzzer, Bill!
Precise and particular always is he
His coarse, Labor neighbor is horrid, to him ;
But when there is whisky it helps him to see
What really good fellows are William and Jim ;
He cheerfully hohnobs with butcher and baker ;
And persons in really ignoble employ
(Staid cop or convivial candlestick-maker)
He tells of his mother ; and Bill is his brother,
And Tom, Dick and Harry he welcomes with joy—
Then, his brother, and “one of the best.”

“Sr” : It was a woman’s voice—sweetest
of all melodies, as some poetic liar or other hath it
—and it pealed forth more or less as follows:
Yes, you lazy ’ound, I went out wasliiri’ for you
two weeks after we wus married. Everywun in the
street knows I kept you an’ yer dirty crowd. Why,
yer own brother kicked you hout fer loafin’ on ’im.
Wun thing, my people are respectible, and ’aven’t
done time fer stealin’ bananas down ther wharf. An’
you come ’oine bline drunk an’ start ter bully me,
who keeps yer. Yer curl Yer nothin’ but a cur!
Yer lazy ’ound. Why don’t yer go an’ live with yer
Missus Egan. Everywun knows what she is. Where
does she get the dresses she wears? Don’t start
bullyin’ me. I won’t stand it. I won’t. Not frum
you ner yer betters.
Hereabouts, the subject of the above remarks must
have moved that the Speaker’s ruling be dissented
from—or something. The crash of hurled crockery
resounded. Screams,, oaths and sundries rent the
air. Ultimately, the local Dunn transpired, and put
the case from the law’s point of view. Silence fol-
lowed. Two days later I got into conversation with
the origin of the trouble. Heedless of a torn blouse
and a black eye, she said blandly
Well, I can truthfully say this. I’ve bin marrid
to Jim (that’s me ’usbind) 30 years, and in all that
time we never had an unkind word b’tween us. What
do you think of that?
I couldn’t think. I was so bewildered that I fell off
thp chair in a swoon.
A TIMELY FURIFICATION.
PICNICKER : “ Would you mind lending us your billy to get a drink of water? It's clean,
I suppose?”
SWAGGIE : “My oath! I just biled some clothes in it. ”
“Sacul”: “Beachcomber” in his par., “Yet
another murder in the Solomon Islands” (B.
15/6/’ll) shows his ignorance of events that
have happened in the Western Solomons since Gib-
bins was murdered 14 years ago. Gibbins, when he
passed out, was trading on his own account,
MacConville likewise. Finlayson was killed by his
own crew, while at anchor at Kokolopi, on the island
of Vella-la-vella, and not at Ohoiseul, as “Beach-
comber” says. And Burns was not killed at the
same place where Bernays met with an accident
which caused his death, but at the entrance to Njai
_ .. T ,■ n i
Passage. Marovo Lagoon was partially closed after
the death of Pankhy, who was the only white man
ever murdered in the Lagoon, and not after the death
of Oliver Burns, who was murdered two years before.
Also, the deed was done outside the Lagoon.
“B. de D.”: When “Mallarapoonie” says
that “native place-names should always be adopted,”
he makes me blush a fine brick-red. Does “ ’Poonie”
not know that most aboriginal place-names are in-
decent ? That is one reason for their wholesale aboli-
tion. Only the other day, in Victoria, a legislative
pow-pow arose over the creation of the Walpeup
shire. “Walpeup,” it was remarked by that emi-
nent linguist Edgar, meant “Stumpy-tailed lizard,”
and he thought it ought to be retained. But one or
two members who had lived in the neighborhood of
the Stumpy-tailed Lizard objected to “Walpeup,”
because it meant something which the young police-
man never mentions to the Bench except in writing.
Edgar was informed privately, so that the naughty
word should not get into Hansard, and he hurriedly
consented to call the municipality Bent—presumably
as the next-worst thing he could think of. Old
Harwood, Chairman of Committees, was so shocked
to hear what the abo. name meant, that he was re-
luctant to say the word from the chair. Some of
the names mentioned by “Mallarapoonie” are not
above suspicion. Two or three of them belong, I
believe, to the vocabulary of Potiphar’s wife, though
I hope I don’t do a perfectly strange lady an in-
justice. It is also notorious, that the more euphoni-
ous the abo. name the more wicked it is in meaning.
In Queensland the names are not so gross as in the
Ma State. Perhaps the worst offenders in this re-
spect were the blacks of Adelaide and its neighbor-
hood, before the blessing of rum came upon them.
“Rough Coal”: Wallaroo (S.A.), which
boasts the largest grain-stacks in the Commonwealth,
claims also a champion “wheat-carrier” in Tom
Coward, whose performances as a wheat-humper for
over 20 years challenge comparison. As recently as
three summers ago Coward carried over 1000 bags
into a 10-bag high stack, in eight hours, on a day
when the sun defied any glass in the town to show
less than 107° in the shade. The bags were of the
old “cockies’ delight” pattern, and averaged 2651 b.
From November to May Coward’s dkily average tally
is about 800 bags. Since the Chapman sack was in-
troduced, his supremacy has been attacked, but a few
hours spent in chasing him up the side of a stack in
a January sun have always settled the argument.
“T.V.T.” : Here’s another effective manner
of outing the fox: Shoot a rabbit .and a number of
small birds —rosella parrots for choice. Singe all
the wool off the rabbit; ' ditto with the birds
(only this time the wool will be feathers). Make a
slit in the breast of each bird and drop in your
powdered strychnine, touching them as little as
possible with your hands. Now go along, burying
the birds just under the surface, and about 100 yards
apart, dragging the carcase of the defunct bunny
above the graves. The burned wool and roasted
flesh will leave a trail that Reynard will follow to
his undoing. I am aware that there are certain
dogs that will eat birds, even when they (the birds)
are not roasted, but this is rare. If a dog
should get a dose of strychnine, a good thing is to
give him a tablespoonful of olive oil.

“Shrapnel”: Why all this waste of time
in pursuing the fox? I, like others, before I was wise,
laid in waiting for him, armed to the teeth, but
found that the little beast could lift a fowl off a
perch with the dexterity of a Cohentingenter, and
go unnoticed. Now I cut a sheep’s brains into
small baits, into each insert two or three grains of
chloral crystals; put the lot into a paper bag, and
slowly brown. This style of cooking effectively
hides all trace of human handling, and Reynard
backs up for more. Then the drug gets in its work,
and you remove his pelt and brush. On awakening
and finding his wearing apparel gone, he turns the
game up in disgust. Only a case-hardened fox will
return to the fowl-yard after losing his hide and
tail.
“Yarrum”: I hasten to pass the dough-
boy to the following descriptive sentence by a South
Coast (N.S.W.) quarryman: “He has a face yer could
knock chips off the Rock of Ages wid!”
TOO SLOW.
STEVE : “ Wot does
that friend o'
yours do f’r a
livin'?
’ENRY : “ Well, 'e’s
'r bloke wot follers
up all kinds 'r
jobs, but I've never
known ’im t'r over-
take one yet."
“Wang”: Only once have I had the an-
guish of meeting a cyclone. It was on a sheep
station up Ballan (Vic.) way, and I was engaged
rounding up sheep, when I heard, afar off, a dull
roaring, like unto 145 million Liberals objecting to
Speaker Willis. Where I was an awful stillness
reigned; but the woolly ones were very uneasy, and
my horse was restless. Presently hail began to fall
in lumps as big as petty cash, and of most aston-
ishing shapes. The bombardment only lasted a few
seconds, and ceased as suddenly as if someone had
turned it off at the spigot. Presently, about two
miles away, across a wide gully, I observed my
cyclone galloping from the far horizon. Through
the terrified forest it rushed, uprooting trees, smash-
ing branches, and twirling them in the air like
straws. A fine homestead, on the edge of the cleared
land, lay in the giant’s path. In an instant it was
in ruins, and sheets of iron, and furniture of all
descriptions soared hundreds of feet into the air, to
be whirled round like so many pieces of paper. My
horse took it into his head to bolt. We arrived at
the stable just as the Blast of Perdition struck it.
One end of the structure fell in, as if it had sud-
denly grown tired, and the roof tore itself away with
a rending crarh, and fled towards the Better Land.
Then I got religion. I fell on my knees and started
to pray ; but the wind got underneath me and began
to lift me up. I was modest; I felt I wasn’t quali-
fied to get round with the Elect just yet, so I caught
at a rafter with all my might. , On a clothes-line
near my hut I had that morning hung up a pair of
trousers to dry. From my rafter I saw my leg
coverings do a wild dance with a coalscuttle, some
500 ft. in the air. Then they left the frivolous iron-
mongery, and disappeared towards Melbourne at an
awful rate. I understood that the storm actually
only raged for a few minutes. To me, hanging on
with my teeth, the time seemed hours. I lay there,
watching building material, furniture, live stock and
other things falling out of the sky until the
air was clear, and everything looked as if it in-
tended to stay where it had landed. Then I climbed
down off the face of the earth with the fear of the
Lord strong within me, and went in search of
whisky. I would have gone to church afterwards if
there had been any church to go to; but there
wasn’t —I had seen the holy edifice scoot past in
sections at 85 miles an hour, and I didn’t think it
was worth while looking for salvation amongst the
foundations. For the time being all salvation had
been blown out of the district.
“Barrington”: Would you mind telling
that suburban Abo. man, who wrote recently that
the pain from the stinging-tree can be cured by rub-
bing the sore place with the under side of the leaf,
that he will find a stinging-tree in the Sydney
Botanical Gardens, on the left-hand side as he enters
from the Art Gallery end. He can’t miss it, because
there is a bees’ nest in it, about a foot from the
ground. Having found it, all he has to do is to
try his “cure.” The cure will do the rest.
“Wonga” : A correspondent from Dingo
Flat, writing to the alleged cocky’s organ,
the Land, argues that farmers should be
sent into Parliament to stop class legisla-
tion. The argument advanced is blithering:
la the district of Goulburn Valley (Vic.), where
I lived before coming to N.S.W., we put a farmer in
to represent us about 30 years ago, and he has re-
presented us ever since, and when he first took his
seat he was our silent member; but I think he has
done more for the country than any other member.
Why? He was ever on the watch, and as time rolled
on and changes were wanted, he knew what to do.
And what is the consequence? Land in his district,
that 40 years ago was only worth £1 per acre, has
been resumed by the Government at £l5 per acre,
and cut up for closer settlement.
What more need be said? Let us vote for
farmer candidates, and in a few years time
we too may be driven out of the district in
which we now live, and may be able to
write from Papua or some distant part
glorying in the fact that in order to get a
piece of farming land in the old place people
have to pay 15 times as much as they used
to. From which it will be concluded that
the success of a farmers’ candidate may be
gauged by his success in making it difficult
for young farmers to get a start. Then the
town property representative will follow —
the successful town property representative
who has shoved up the rent of a four-roomed
house from 10s. to £7 10s. a week. And what
a splendid success he will be!
“Boarded Out” : Carmichael, Minister for
Public Instruction in N.S.W., has been
thinking out a new scheme, or half scheme,
for the benefit of the boys, or,some of the
boys, thrown upon the care of the State
either through misfortune or misbehavior.
These wards are drafted into two divisions.
The better-behaved are apprenticed to “the
backbone of the country,” and become the
“State kid” of agricultural sweaterdom. The
more unpromising samples are sent into in-
stitutions such as the Mittagong I arm
Home. This is where Carmichael blows in
through the open door. Arguing that the
State stands in loco parentis to the young
rips at the Farm Home, he concludes its
plain duty is to set them up in life, and he
proposes to earmark areas of State lands
which the reformed youths of th° Home
will have the right to < rAc h sv as tree
gifts or on mos 'U'-h’rLxc cerms. Which is
all right as far as it goes, but what about
me and dozens of other chaps who, by no
fault of our own, find ourselves under the
guardianship of the State? We’ve got no
murky records against us —except that we
do not rise and publicly denounce a Labor
Government which, for fear of losing votes
in the country, is staving off the Royal Com-
mission of Inquiry into the cruelty of oar
conditions. And because we have clean re-
cords we are to be treated worse than those
whose records are anything but clean. It
Minister Carmichael is going to give away
blocks of land in return for a bad character,
I reckon I can bring myself into line; but
I’d sooner the recompense was for a good
character. Also, I reckon Carmichael
would find it a better proposition in the long
run.
TRUE LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The simple sailor, east ashore
Where palm trees shaded all the isle,
The nude, Pacific savage bore
To where a lady—free from guile,
But black as any parson’s tile —
Ruled all the land
With strong and yet benignant hand.
The lady smiled upon the tar,
And gave him freedom over quite
An acre and a half. That far
He roamed by day. He slept at night,
Indulged a lib’ral appetite,
And grinned (poor Tim)
To think the Queen was mashed on him.
And so she was, with passion true.
One day that plougher of the sea
In something of an Irish stew,
With paste and vegetables three,
And seasonings, she had for tea.
So was it shown
She loved him for himself alone.

The supply of Eureka Stockaders peters
out slowly. The other day, George Bentley
was burned to death in his hut at Glen Park
(Vic.), at the age of 84. The only piece
of property he left behind him was the
sword he fought with under Lalor’s silver
stars.
Hugh Hamilton Gibson, who died at
Mulwala station, near Yarrawonga (Vic.),
last week, was the old-time squatter who, in
’47, took up the Glenample estate, near Port
Campbell, in partnership with R. E. McAr-
thur. He was there at the time of the wreck
of the Loch Ard, and sheltered the only two
survivors—Miss Carmichael and her rescuer,
Tom Pearce. The lady was married some
years ago, and now lives in Ireland.

stand for Melbourne,
as a supporter of the
Weary Ministry.
After his defeat he

F. H. Bathurst, edi-

leaving a good billet
for what 10,000
friends hope will
prove a better —the
managership of a
stockbroking business.
Dick Hartley, another Australian black-
ana white artist, whose work has been get-
ting favorable attention in N’York of late,
has been appointed art editor of Satire, a
new paper which hopes to make a stir once
a week in that bloated hamlet.
There is evidently a fatal affinity between
food—especially sweet food —and our Pie
Commissioner. The first photo of G. Reid
that has been published in Australia for
many a long day, appeared in the Sydney
Mail last week. George has his arm in a
sling, a far-away look in his eye, and this
legend at his feet: —

Canny Mr. Wallace, attacking party in
the most successful Divorce Court melo-

quietly married in the vicinity of Colac the
other day. The bride is a handsome country
lass, with a whole granary full of beans.
Billy T.” : There were a good many ladies
in the gallery while Andy Fisher plodded
through his Budget speech, all trying to
look absorbed. When he had finished, the

very talkative, isn't he?”

Curtis, for many years secretary of Melbourne
Athenaeum Father Birt, 0.5.8., clears it up in his
big Benedictine book, just published in London:
Curtis, he says, was a Benedictine monk in earlv
manhood, and a member of the teaching staff at
Lyndhurst College, a Benedictine foundation in
Sydney. He suddenly cleared out of Sydney with a
lady, and settled in Melbourne, where he became a
tutor, secretary of the Early Closing Association, and
finally secretary of the Melbourne Athenaeum. Ignor-
f'C® bliss. R.C. members of the Athenaeum
might have been rather embarrassed had they known
tnat their secretary was a married monk —or ex-
monk.

“O.K.’s” memories of “high” life:
A recent Bulletin mention of how “Bob” Sievier
alias Sutton, once brought a libel action aa-iinot
Sir James Duke, and didn’t win it, is a spade for
digging up some old scandals from the grave o
Mel “°™ e s memory. James Duke had known Sutton
m Melbourne 20 years earlier. The baronet was a
whilst 7 m ° UnS B ' lobe ' troUer > putting up at Menzies’
whilst his acquaintance, Lord Deerhurst (the Earl
ot Coventry s hopeful son) was quartered at Gov-
ernment House as aide to Sir Henry Loch. Deer-
hurst owed a collection of wagers to cash
bookmaker “Bob” Sutton, and showed no sign of
wanting to settle up. The bookmaker got into a
way ot asking Ins Lordship for the money whenever
S " 18ht they met in a Bourke-street
hotel, and Mr. Sutton was so very sarcastic that Deer-
hurst called him a low fellah; whereupon the low
‘ e Y a X> wh f ° , was , the more distinguished-looking
gambler of the two, hit his Lordship on what he
smelled with. In those days a Governor’s aide-de-
kong was only a little less than an archangel. He
charged bookmaker “Bob” at Melbourne Police
Court with assault and battery, and Magistrate
Panton, treating an attack' on the Governor’s aide
as a treasonable offence, sentenced the unabashed
‘Bob” to 14 days in gaol. “Bob” lodged an ap-
P£ ai ’, °1 oL i rs s,’ and the conviction was quashed.
lhe tact that the community—racing and otherwise
had been scoffing at Panton, P.M., may have helped
to convince the Tory Judges of the period that Sir
Henry Loch’s aide-de-camp’s nose had deserved punch-
ing. So Sutton-Sievier escaped with flying colors.
This was one of the “blackguardly” incidents in his
career that Sir James Duke brought up against him
20 years later. There were others, though. After
he had left Australia, and returned to England, his
wife —a pretty South Melbourne girl—divorced him,
the learned Judge branding him as a heartless indi-
vidual, or words to that effect. Not so long after-
wards, he astonished polite society in Britain by
capturing the hand and fortune of the dissipated
Marquis of Ailesbury’s sentimental sister. She had
met “Bob” in her brother’s company, and mistaken
him badly. The political question in London
now is: Will the story of “Bob’s” exciting
past prevent him from topping the poll as a
Unionist candidate for Hoxton? Probablv not.
Hoxton is a district where “Bob’s” past will add
lustre to the brightness of “Bob’s” present. If he
addresses the Cockney electors in some of the lan-
guage he used to hurl at the punters when he was
bookmaking in Australia, he will probably start
favorite, at 6 to 4 on.
THE N.S.W. STATE
POLITICAL SLTUA-
TION.
WADE : Boo-oo-oo! McGowen won't throw
the lolly stick over the fence and let's race
for it."
At the meeting of the South British In-
surance Co., in Auckland (M.L.),the other
day, the chairman said they had just heard
from their general manager, James Kirker,
who was on his way back from Europe via
America; he had written to say he felt better
than he had for years. ■ The chairman had
hardly finished the remarks when Kirker
died on the road. He was a man of vast
energy, who saw a long distance ahead, and
he burnt himself out at 54. He was little
more than 30 when he became general mana-
ger of the concern at a time when it had
made heavy losses, and there wasn’t a divi-
dend on the horizon. Last year the co. paid
a 35 per-cent, dividend, and could have paid
another 50 per cent, if it had wanted to.
And, instead of having less than no reserves
at all, it has a pile of over £550,000, all ac-
cumulated in KirkePs time. It was the ex-
traordinary performance of a very unusual
man.
Frank Henty, whose name is familiar to
all readers of The Bulletin, is standing in
the Labor interest against Donald Mackin-
non, for Prahran (Victoria). Donald Mac-
kinnon, barrister and landowner, son of
Daniel of that ilk, has represented Prahran
since the year 1900. Previous to that, Don-
ald, son of Daniel, had one experience as the
badly-licked candidate for Prahran. At his
five successful elections he has sometimes
been miles ahead of his antagonist, and some-
times he has just crawled in. Donald is
wholly uncertain. He promised once to be a
good, reliable Democrat, but he faded con-
siderably. He is suspected of having a brain
the size of a portmanteau, but being tired,
like Premier Murray, he never got further
than being an honorary Minister without
portfolio for a year and a half. And he
served under Thomas Bent, of all people, and
was one of eight honorary Ministers in that
amazing person’s immense Cabinet. Mac-
kinnon’s opponent ought to beat him, unless
the Tory press discovers at the last moment
that Frank Henty murdered his widow, is a
habitual suicide, poisoned all his ancestors,
and made whatever money he possesses by
heavily insuring a cataract, and then setting
it on fire. Just by way of clearing his char-
acter in advance, The Bulletin hereby
attests that he did none of these things.
THE FIRST STEP.
Jack Johnson has been made a Freemason. — Cable.
C. S. Baillee, just dead in Adelaide, at 85,
was one of the contracting Baillees in Vic-
toria half a century back. They did a lot of
big things about Ballarat and in the Western
District; and in S. Aus. they built the Mor-
pliett-street bridge, the old Port light-
house and much of what is now the inter-
state railway line. In fact, the two- southern
States are splashed all over with rail and
bridge monuments to this sound worker.
Owing to the long illness and apparently
hopeless condition of Speaker Coles, the
S. Aus. Assembly has appointed Newland to
be acting-Chairman of Committees, to take
some of the load off Harry Jackson’s shoul-
ders. Newland is a comparatively new
member. Before his election, five years ago,
he was a conductor on the S. Aus. railways.
Professor Beard, conductor of St. Pat's
in Melbourne, is off to Europe on furlough-'
and it is not certain that he will return. If
he doesn't, it will be chiefly because he hasn’t
met such appreciation as his high Birming-
ham reputation called for.

FEDERAL HON. MINISTER E. A.
ROBERTS, OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
“Rad” on peers and other animals:—
It is a queer coincidence that, on the same day.
almost, that the cable mentioned the latest bank-
ruptcy trouble of Lord Yarmouth, it should have
also mentioned the latest bankruptcy trouble of
Sir Robert Peel. Their forebears —both distin-
guished men after their different fashions —were
intimate friends. Lord Yarmouth’s progenitor was,
of course, the original of Thackeray’s “Marquis of
Steyne.” (The house which Becky Sharp visited, and
where so many of his alleged wickednesses occurred,
now contains the famous Wallace Collection of pic-
tures.) There seems no doubt that, like so many of
Thackeray’s historical portraits (that of Swift, for
example), it was the crudest of libels. Thackeray
advanced on figures of this sort, handicapped by a
full measure of the sentimentality and ultra-morality
of his period. Disraeli’s “Monmouth,” who was also
the Marquis of Hertford, is a far more credible •
character. Needless to say, the brilliant young man ,
who first burst on the Regent’s Court as Lord Yar-
mouth was not a Primitive Methodist, and he be-
came no saintlier as he grew older. He was a
reckless gambler, and his relations with women
were various enough to shock a lamp post. He was;
called “Red Herrings” by his intimates, an obvious •
nickname that is likewise borne by his insolvent;
descendant. He married a lady of vast wealth. Two <
old gentlemen left her their fortunes, each believing:
that he was her father. The Marquis tired of her,,
after a while, and she, though living a superficially/
correct life, did not conceal from her friends that 1 :
she was the mistress of Marshal Junot. One traces;
many traits in the modern Yarmouth which might
have come down to him from the ancient Hertford).
Both loved the stage, and everything connected with
it; both were the dupes of fools; both were ex-
travagant ; both married heiresses; both caused the
entire English nation to elevate its hands in horror
at their unconventionality. The great Hertford
(Wellington himself called him great) died, as he
had lived, in fear of madness —a hereditary trouble
in this familv. The grandfather of the young man
who has just been gaoled was one of the mourners at
his funeral.
THE LONELY ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s a lonely road to travel by,
And folks one meets are few,
And some, one asks one’s way of, try
To lead one all askew.
A lonely road to travel, yes;
But every now and then,
One clinks a glass of happiness
With merry gentlemen;
Or some plump damsel up the hill
Will sweetly take one’s arm. . .
A lonely road to travel; still
It has a certain charm.
It’s a lonely road to travel, now
The days are getting short;
But on fine afternoons I vow
There’s mighty pleasant sport.
A lonely road to travel, ’tis,
And, ah 1 the nights are long ;
But here and there are hostelries
That still resound with tong.
Into our inn we stalk and strut,
Or roll from out the night. . . .
A lonely road to travel; but
The lights are gleaming bright.
It’s a lonely road to travel, boy ;
But give the deuce his due:
Some joys are still without alloy,
And some old friends are true.
A lonely road to travel? . . . Ay,
And scant the store we spend;
But Death’s long sleep and lullaby
Are waiting at the end.
Footsore, with aching loin and shank,
We limp. Our strength nigh gone.
A lonely road to travel. . . . Thank
The gods, we’re getting on!
MAORILAND.

The N. S. Wales revenue for October,
1911, was £8698 more than for October, 1910, anil
for the first four months of this financial year the
Government collected £151,060 more than in the
same third of the previous 12 months. But the ex-
penditure jumps twice for every bound of the revenue
—revenue increase, £151,060; expenditure ditto,
£310,059. Total expenditure has been: —
Revenue account .. ..£5,458,579
Public Works Fund . . . . 306,961
Closer Settlement Fund . . 133,498
From the pawnshop . . . . 1,423,016
Total £7,322,054
That is for a third of a year. Still, this paper isn’t
alarmed at the growth of the figures under the head-
ing of revenue account. Very nearly half that ex-
penditure is on account of the working of railways
and tramways. If Private Enterprise handled those
services, the State expenditure would be thus cut
down by about one-half; but the public would cer-
tainly be paying more. The current attempt to
dragoon the public into alarm at the growth of the
expenditure on revenue account had better, therefore,
be watched. What is alarming is the prodigious
growth of the loan expenditure. You can’t borrow
and spend and be done with it; this sort of expendi-
ture carries the sting of interest in its tail. And
that interest won’t shrivel a shilling p.c., no matter
how unprofitable the work may prove, no matter
what bad times may strike the country, no matter
how extravagant the present cost may be. As a
sample of the outrageous prices that have been paid
lately for things, the BibbenJuke estate purchase
may be cited. It was the last estate bought under
the Wade regime, and such a price was paid for it
that when it was offered the other day, land-hunters,
with a drought in some parts to remind them of
their dangers, and with a weaker wheat market to
figure on, turned down the farms at the price. There
was practically no competition, and only a third of
them were taken.
What was said just now about the wisdom of
keeping your eyes open when you are asked to be
alarmed about the growth of the States’ revenue
figures is illustrated by something that is happening
in Victoria. “Other public works” yielded last
month £53,759, or £30,179 more than in October,
1910. But that doesn’t mean more taxation; it
simply means that the Powlett State coal mine sold
that much more coal. Total Victorian revenue for
the four months has been £2,882,340, an increase
of £106,506. But in view of the increased means
of revenue-production, and in the absence of expendi-
ture figures, that information is worth little. The
time has unquestionably come when the income from
these public businesses should be kept separate—and
the expenditure too, of course.
Queensland figures are almost as useless:
, 1910. 1911-
hour months’ revenue ..£1,806,271 £2,028,169
Four months’ expenditure 1,014,886 1,208,657
Surplus .. £791,385 £819,512
That looks all right, but it isn’t what it looks. It
only means that the State has the surplus saved up
towards paying interest; and the size of the interest
bill isn’t mentioned. Also, though £819,512 is
greater than £i91,385, the position for 1911 may
be worse because there may be more than £28,127
extra to charge against the revenue. The Northern
State’s dreadful loan drunk continues. To date this
year (four months), £864,956 has been borrowed
and blewed.” Digby Denham has introduced a bill
to (among other things) save Mulga William from
being lamb-downed at the bush pub. Meantime he
himself leads the unfortunate State to the pawnshop,
where it can be lambed-down quite as effectually.
Westralia has a deficit of £50,338 for the month;
but it is quite used to such things. “The effect of
the drought on the wheat crops will probably cause
a severe shrinkage in the railway revenue for the
J?®** ,^ ve months,” is added as a semi-official note.
Yet it was only the other day that The Bulletin,
when it mentioned drought in connection with
Westralian agriculture, was asked how many more
stinking fish it had in its basket. There are some
people who want you to cry “Schnapper” for them
all the time, even if they have only got shark on
hand. South Australia is still in a clover patch;
its three months’ revenue was £993,640, and the
expenditure £899,236. Compared with last year
the revenue was £114,673 more, while the expendi-
ture was only £28,576 more.

As indicated by chairman Rater’s speech at the
half-yearly meeting, the past six months have been
nothing but disaster. (1) The strike in Queensland
meant a _ loss, which ‘‘was increased because we
thought it well to assist the canegrowers in the
disturbed districts to obtain the requisite labor.”
(2) Four wet months in Queensland “have been
succeeded by nearly six months of continuous
drought.” (3) There is a drought in Fiji, and
u? 1 ? ,P lere * sn ’t a drought there was a storm
which damaged the tramway and bridges consider-
ably. (4) Fiji has started direct taxation. (5)
the co. might have made some money out of a sud-
den rise in the price of sugar in Europe, but un-
happily it ‘ cancelled purchases of sugar in Java for
which we could now find a good market.” (6) The
eo.’s steamer Fiona was very nearly wrecked, and
that would have been a beautiful bit of misery;
but unhappily the wretched thing merely grazed it-
self. Still, it had to be repaired, and that was some
consolation. Thus naturally, between one thing
and another, the co. didn’t make any profit (any-
way, it only made £210,830 in the six months),
and there was no hope of a dividend (for a mere
£165,000 isn’t worth talking about).
This poor old Job has other afflictions, of course.
The Commission to inquire into the sugar industry
is one of them. “We shall in due course,” says the
chairman, “state our view of the situation, and it
will be necessary, in order to silence those who have
attacked us, to set forth the position of the co. ip
fuller detail than hag yet been dope. That we
should be compelled to do this for our protection is
ip itself a grave wrong > but our Parliaments now
lose _ sight altogether of the liberties of the com-
munity, so a co. which has not since its registra-
tion paid a dividend equal to 5 p.c. p.a. on the cost
of its assets has to prove that it is not a danger to
the State because of the profits it divides.” The
time has passed for the spokesmen of this co. to
humbug either themselves or the public with such
rubbish as this. By such ingenuous yarns the thou-
sands who won’t do any thinking for themselves
are led to believe that there really can’t be any
danger ahead —and presently they will be pretty
certain to find out that there is. What, for in-
stance, is the use of talking of a div. which has
never been 5 p.c. “on the cost of the assets ” ?
Take a case. A co. is formed with a capital of
£lOO,OOO, which it puts into (say) plant and
stock. In the first year it makes £lO,OOO. It pays
5 p.c., and puts £5OOO into more plant and stock.
Next year it makes £15,000. It pays 5 p.c. again,
and puts £lO,OOO into plant and stock. The third
year it makes £20,000. Still it pays 5 p.c., and
puts another £15,000 into plant and stock. Thus,
though it has only paid 5 p.c. p.a. on its capital,
and less than 5 p.c. on its assets, it has put £30,000
into stock, plant, etc. It now, therefore, waters its
capital—issues one free share for every four. Next
year it pays a 5 p.c. div.; but that 5 p.c. really
means 6| p.c., because of the “water.” Yet, though
shareholders really get 6i p.c., it is less than 5 p.c.
on the cost of the assets. Next year the co. makes
£25,000, and the same for the next five years. By
the end of that time it will be able to capitalise
another £75,000 of reserves; and thereafter, though
the dividend will be nominally 5 p.c., and though
it won’t be equal to 5 p.c. on the cost of the
assets, it will be really a 10 p.c. return on the
capital actually put into the business by share-
holders. So the thing may go on indefinitely. In
the case of the C.S.R., the fact that, though the co.
pays an 11 p.c. div., the total is not equal to 5 p.c.
on the cost of the assets simply means that more
than 60 p.c. of the assets have been provided out
of profits. That is to say, the co. has made such
huge profits that, besides paying a dividend of 10
or 11 p.c. on repeatedly watered capital, it has
accumulated assets greater in cost than those that
have been provided out of capital. The whole
question at issue is whether this is a fair charge
to levy upon one of the primary industries of the
country by the people who refine the product of
that industry. If an investor has an idea that the
majority of the people will decide that it isn’t a
fair thing, then he must take the fact into account
in estimating the probable future of the co.

1911.. 49,383 21,134 6106 19,564 17,786
So far as the past three years are concerned, you
can figure it out this way:—
1909. 1910. 1911.
Traffic receipts .. .. £129,033 £130,710 £133,356
Sale of current .. .. 7,247 8,416 9,079

Total revenue .. £136,831 £139,977 £143,839
Less working expenses 91,853 92,011 94,456
Profit as above .. £44,978 £47,966 £49,383
There are one or two things to explain, though, to
make these figures tally with those in the very
comprehensive accounts published by the Welling-
ton municipality. Those accounts show:—
Working exes., tramways .. ..£92,026
Ditto account current sold . . . . 3,939
Total £95,965
But revenue has been charged with £1844 on
account of the Accident Fund, whereas the actual
outgiongs were £335, thus leaving £1509 in the
hands of the corporation; and that amount, not
having been spent, has been deducted from the
expenses in the foregoing statement. Also, there
is an amount of £3825 about which this paper
has some doubts. In the published accounts it is
shown as revenue appropriated for various im-
provements, etc., and that plan has been followed
in the table. That is to say, it is first reckoned
as revenue and then as an amount written off,
whereas it probably would be just as well included
with the working exes. If that were done the
year’s profit would, of course, be £3825 less.
And, finally, though apart from sinking fund there
are now said to be £17,786 of reserves, there are
really no reserves at all, because £26,073 of pre-
liminary exes, still remain to be written off. The
paper asset is being gradually got rid of, and the
amounts written off are included under that head-
ing in the table. It is not, however, being got
rid of fast enough. Fictitious assets very rarely
are.
The capital account shows an outlay of
£612,551, made up this way:—
I Tramways £483,423
Loans-! Power supply .. .. 30,000
lighting .. ... 12^100
Land Co.’s contribution .. .. 10,000
Provided out of revenue .. .. 77,028
The Depreciation and Renewals Fund, into which
the bulk of the amount written off is put, now
totals £72,105. This is invested in the business,
and accounts for most of the £77,028 just men-
tioned. Presumably as renewals are made or re-
pairs paid for out of this fund, the cost will be
written off. It would, anyhow, be absurd to pile
up the figures by keeping in the accounts both
the cost of the original work paid for out of capi-
tal, and that of the substituted work paid for out
of this Renewals Fund. The Sinking Fund is verv
properly invested apart from the business—in
municipal bonds and mortgages. This fund now
totals £29,373, and with its own interest accre-
tions will soon begin to grow much more rapidly.
The Sinking Fund contribution is 1 p.c. per an-
num on the total amount borrowed. The amount
set aside for depreciation averages 2f p.c. on cost.
This certainly would not be equal to requirements
if a very liberal amount were not spent on main-
tenance and charged to ordinary working exes.
Last year’s repair and maintenance bill, paid in
this way, ran to £19,647.
A 1 p.c. sinking fund, invested at 44 p.c. (and
this sinking fund is bringing in rather more than
that), will wipe out the original debt in about
38 years; and when that happy time arrives the
Wellington municipal enterprises will be freed, not
only of the sinking fund obligation, but of the
interest bill of £21,134. The council will then
have about £26,000 a year at its disposal, which
may be used in reduction of fares and light-
ing and power charges, in paying for other public
works and institutions or (least satisfactory of all) in
relief of rates. Also, the people will own the
tramways and lighting works which now are to
all intents and purposes owned bv Cohen, the
money-lender. Meantime, the public' is getting a
service at so cheap a rate that, after paying
actual working exes, and current ordinarv re-
pairs, the surplus or profit is equal to only 9 \
p.c. on the capital actually borrowed; and that
9 « p.c. has to provide for interest (about 4J
p.c.), renewals (23 p.c.), sinking fund, and special
repairs and contingencies.
Reference has been made to the sale ,©f power
and light by the Tramway enterprise. This is,
however, only a side-line. The corporation has a
separate Electric Lighting Department, whose
operations will he put on th,e table some
other time.

Australia is a great country, all right, but it
would be a lot greater if Nature had piled up a
chain of mountains, 20,000 ft. high, in its innards
Nature, however, overlooked that necessary part
of her job, with the result that, besides having no
long rivers to speak of, the country is cursed
with a most uncertain rainfall. If the fall is
much below the average the land does so little
that it lies almost fallow j and when the rain
does fall, after perhaps two or three droughty
years, the rested land produces amazing crops—
crops which it couldn’t possibly give year after
year. Thus Australia flies to extremes. Unfor-
tunately when the naturally-fallowed land is giving
up its accumulated virtues, Australia has a habit
of assuming that things are going to be always
like that, so it borrows and adds to the boom, and
prices of land and other things go sky-rocketing
Then the absence of the 20,000 ft. mountain chain
tells again, and the rainfall misses, and the slump
is dreadful—till the procession comes round once
more, and good rains produce a few more boom
harvests from the rejuvenated land. You can read
this history in this society’s accounts. Formed in
1871, it for some time did a safe, solid, prosper-
ous business.. Then things worked up for a boom,
and this society joined in. Besides its own capital
in £lO shares, it had £330,000 of other people’s
money out on loan. Boom harvests and wool clips
resulted in wild borrowing, and, having very few
manufactures to put the money into, people
gambled in land. Then a drought or so happened,
and this co. had so many securities thrown on its
hands, and their values were so badly depre-
ciated, . that to counterbalance the shrinkage it
wrote its £lO shares down to £3. Even that
wasn’t enough, so the depositors were asked to be
kind; and to further help things on, no div. was
paid for years. After a while the country, having
had a good rest, burst out into the present suc-
cession of phenomenal crops, and up sailed values
again; so that the co. got rid of much of its old
written-down property at much bigger prices than
it had expected; and on the basis of those and
other sales the sediment in hand was re-valued.
The result was that £3 of the old written-off
capital was restored four years ago, and now it
has been decided to restore another £l. That’s
as far as things have gone.
As for the future—well? It may be; unlike the
past; but this paper hasn’t heard of a new 20,000 ft
mountain range being heaped up. Yet that is just
about the one thing that could make the past no
guide to the future. St. Joseph’s present situation
is that it owes £62,586; and this and its own
funds are represented by £130,949 of advances
and properties, and £11,230 of other “assets,
mostly liquid. It is impossible to say how much
of the former lump consists of new advances and
how much of old properties. It doesn’t seem as
though any great amount of new advance business
has been got; and that is just as well, unless the
co. has been extremely cautious, because it is
just about as certain as anything can be that
there is going to be a big slump in some values
presently. Two things have conspired to produce
an utterly fictitious value. A block or two of land
is “sold” on long terms at £5 a foot. If the
alleged buyer had to pay cash he wouldn’t go £3
for it; but he doesn’t look beyond his 5 p.c. cash
deposit. Yet it is shrieked as loud as profes-
sional shriekers know how that the land has been
sold at £5, and thus a standard is established.
Presently, when the land boom dies, you won’t
get £lO an acre for some of that goat-walk.
Also, when the present building boom eases off,
a humpy that now costs £lOOO to build won’t
run to more than £750. There are sizeable rocks
ahead, therefore, for the concern which is lending
on property—particularly suburban property; and
the one that dodges damage will have a lot to
thank its management for.

Aekated Bread Co. (Sydney), which was

That puts the best face on things; and most likely
it’s a much better face than they deserve. For in-
stance, the amount writtei) off for the past half-year
is £553. Now, that is written off leaseholds, and
an amount written off leaseholds is a poor writing-
off at best; it is much more of the nature of rent,
and therefore to be deducted from profits. Also,
part of the surplus profit shown, and used in reduc-
tion of the deficit, is a sum added to the Depreciation
Fund; and that is probably a bit put in the stock-
ing to pay for the renewal of the crockery when it
gets a few more chips knocked out of it. Mean-
time, it certainly seems that current repairs and re-
newals are being charged up to Profit and Loss;
though it has to be remembered that future re-
newals are _ very likely to be heavier than those
called for in a comparatively new business. Fur-
ther, though the present deficit —that is, the total of
paper assets in excess of reserves—is stated in the
table at £13,782, there is another £3321 repre-
sented by leasehold property ; and that is a very
doubtful asset. The cash position has improved sub-
stantially :
Sept., ’lO. Sept., ’ll.
Cash and book debts . . . . £6056 £10,109
Liabilities 2903 3,423
Surplus .. ..£3153 £6,686
Thus, after paying the divs. in October and April,
and adding a trifle, perhaps, to the stock and plant
(though the latter now stands at less in the books),
£3533 has been saved up. That is a fair showing,
though it doesn’t follow that it is all true surplus
profit—part of it may, for instance, be onlv a set-off
against actual depreciation. Still, £3533 "is a good
lay-by; it is over 10 per cent, on the capital. The
weak feature is the large proportion of the capital
represented by paper assets, from which not a penny
has been formally written off. And a further large
proportion of the capital is represented by assets
which probably haven’t much of a liquidation value
—plant and the like. While the current profits are
unquestionably good, the security might, therefore,
be very much better. A co. which has to earn divi-
dends on a heap of paper capital is always liable to
bump the awkward competition of a concern which
only wants a return on its real capital; moreover,
the co. which establishes a profitable business in
leasehold premises is always liable to have an awk-
ward argument with the landlord when the lease ex-
pires.

hard that the mining properties must now stand at
almost nothing in the books. Four years ago, when
detailed information was available, the East Greta
freehold had been written down to £10,500 and
Stanford Merthyr to £9OOO. About £lOOO a year
had been coming off each item for several years
previously, and presumably the same policy has
since been pursued. The surplus profit has been
put into plant; how much has gone that way it

been over £54,000. The amount stated here as
written off is probably well under the mark. Large
sums have also been spent on the railway and on
the mines—assuredly over £25,000. Certainly all
this has not been done out of revenue. In 1905
the liquid assets were £5889 in excess of liabili-

l £lO,OOO J
This co. had almost worked out its old mine at
Newcastle before it thought about getting a new
one, and then it hadn’t got the capital put by to
pay for the new one and develop it. Altogether it
was a shocking example of improvidence, and the
co. doesn’t deserve that things should turn out as
well as they promise to. The difficulties were all
the greater, because the co. had already an issue of
12i p.c. pref. shares—2o,ooo of them —and some of
the holders, viewing the outlook as hopeless, filed a
petition in Equity, praying for the winding-up of
the co., on the ground that the co. was formed to
work a mine which no longer existed. As it hap-
pened, shareholders had just previously approved of
the purchase of a new property, the Neath, at Cess-
nock, so the petitioners’ plea just missed the ’bus.
Conditions then began to favor the disgraceful co.
The coal trade was brisk, and trucks were in great
demand, and the co. made good money by hiring
out its stock. Also, the new mine was opened up
easily and cheaply, and the co.’s trading connec-
tion was mostly kept. It, therefore, soon began to
show profits. Then another trouble arose over the
rights of the three classes of shares—an original
70,000, the 12-1 p.c. preference lot of 20,000 and
another 20,000 new shares. The pref. people said
that their 121 P-c. was cumulative; some of the
holders of the original ordinary shares alleged that
the last two issues were illegal. The Equity Court
said the issues were quite in form; so, by way of a
taste, the prefs. now get £lO,OOO, being four years’
back dividend. As far as this paper can trace, the

To which loss add, if you iike; the adtn'.nisr.ratiph
and special exes, and charges and depreciation, in
all £15,296. As this experience merely repeated
that of the previous half-year, it wasn’t any too Soon
that the mill was looked to. George Weir, of the
North, probably the most expert mill engineer at
Broken Hill, was called in. Something ot the Sort
should have been done long ago. Eighteen months
back The Bulletin said it was time the directors
found out whether the atrociously bad recoveries
were due, as affirmed, to the extra-refractory nature
of the ore or to the extra-awfulness of the mill.
Weir blames the mill, and the directors are spending
£20,000 upon it. Last half-year the makeshift re-
covered only 37.36 p.c. of the silver and 65.45 p.c.
of the lead. Broken Hill North in its last half-year
recovered 54.8 p.c. of the silver and 76.86 of the
lead. It is only fair to say that the ores are not
of the same character, those of Block 10 being
harder and finer grained.
Including money to he received from Stored by-
products sold, Block 10 has £122,891 of liquid
assets in excess of liabilities; £77,556 of this is
actual cash in hand. A few thousands more will be
receivable by way of bonus on contracts if zinc keeps
above £2O per ton. But from that must come
£15,000, or more, to be yet spent on the mill. Be-
sides liquid and semi-liquid assets, there is the ore
in the mine. No estimate of reserves is made; the
last time one Was made, 18 months ago, it was reck-
oned that 600,000 tons could be got out if produc-
tion wasn’t rushed. Approximately, 136,000 tons
have since then been extracted; on the other hand,
fair bodies have been developed—quantity unknown \
probably 100,000 tons. But their worth has yet to
be demonstrated by the new mill. On the past half-
vear’s record, it wouldn’t pay to take most of this
ore out. There ought, however, to be a solid profit
in the ore if it is handled aright. If Block 10 can
only make one-third as much profit per ton as its
neighbors to the south, it would still bag about 6s.
per ton for the ore in the mine. Before anything
definite can be said on this point, though, the new
mill must speak. # *
Broken Hill Block 14, which has kept the
pot boiling for nearly four years, by gouging out
the overlooked carbonates in the upper levels, didn t
get much from that source last half : year. But it
made a sale of old slimes to the Junction North, and
the first £5OOO dropped in during the six months.
(There is another £7850 to come next year.) The
term shows a profit of £13,361, which was cut up
this way: Pref. dividend (10 p.c. p.a.), *- 15 00,
depreciation, £2350; balance forward, £9511. The
eo still has £86,391 of liquid assets in excess of
liabilities, pins an unknown quantity of carbonates
and (sav) 200,000 tons of sulphides. But as the
is past work, and it would cost £20,000
to nut it right, the directors are just hanging on to
the sulphide reserves in the hope that some day some
other co. will make an offer for them.

On the official figures, Ivyloe (N.S.W.) is
achieving a metallurgical triumph. For the weeks
run the plant treated 357 tons of 5 p.c. stuff, and
nroduced 41 tons 14 cwt. of ,|ig concentrates, con-
taining 9 tons 8 cwt. copper ; also 26 tons 18 cwt. of
flotation concentrates, containing 6 tops 15 cwt..of
Conner. Total concentrates, 68 tons 12 cwt. , total
copper contents, 16 tons 3 cwt. Concentrates aver-
aged about 24 p.c. copper all round, from 5 p.c. ore.
If this 5 p.c. original value is approximately correct,
the residues only contain half a unit of copper. In
a matter of this kind everything depends on the
correctness of the estimate of the copper value sent
to the mill, and practically the only means of verify-
ing this value is by carefully assaying the tailings
and residues. Presumably, general manager Dun-
stan, being a very careful man, has done this.
Cope’s Creek (N.S.W.), for six months
to September 30, made a tidy profit of £2759, from
52 tons of tin oxide. A sixpenny dividend costs
£9OO and three of this amount were paid during
the half-year. The profit pans out a trifle over £53
ner ton of tin oxide; and from that anybody can
calculate how much the record price of the metal
helped the co. * * *
At Woolwich, on the Parramatta River,
just outside Sydney, the Radium Hill Co. is put-
ting up a little plant with which it hopes to start
the production of radium some time in December.
There won’t be any need to charter steamers to
take the product away. The mine is at Olary

evolved a process of his * own * which, though
tedious, still doesn’t involve 20,000 washings or
anything like that number. He has treated over
25 tons of the ore at Bairnsdale, at a cost of under
£3O per ton, and he estimates a radium extraction
of £65 per ton. The process does not, however,
seem to have been completed so far as the buK

nevertheless, been obtained. It is . imderstood that
Prof. Pollock, of Sydney University, has now a
sample under observation. It is obviously a radio-
active substance; but since radium isn t the only
radio-active substance, and Since the different sub
stances “grow” at different speeds, it becomes
necessary as a final test to observe them for a
month. Nevertheless, as no technical difficulties
are presented between the stage at which the pro
duct stands and the radium of commerce, it can

operated on a commercial scale are not so well

at Bairnsdale and the £65 which is said to be
the value of the product. Also, there are by-pro-
ducts —uranium and rare earths ( ea P?«ally
thorium)—to which attention will no doubt be
given. (
Radcliff, the chemist who is giving the co. this
hope of success, is a S. Australian product. Pro-
fessor Bragg, formerly of Adelaide University, is

most of the experimental work on this co.’s ores
has been done. He will be in charge of the plant
at Woolwich. The magnetic separators will, ot
course, be on the mine. # *

The Mount Ida district (W.A.), of which
verv little is ever heard, has now produced something
over 60,0000 z. of gold, and maintains a good output
from ore won by prospectors. In most, cases the
mine-owners are satisfied to plod away without out-

Kalgurli (W.A.) is adapting itself + to re-
duced circumstances, and turning everything that is
likely to give a margin of profit to account. Low-
grade ore bodies, which at one time were given the
cold shoulder, are receiving attention, and a >'e being
followed “in a manner calculated to give the best
nossible results.” The best of these deposits so
far is that located in the south block, at the No. 1
level. This formation has already been proved for
120 ft or more, and is still going south. It has a
width of at least 40ft. over its entire length, but on
the level and below it the value (7dwt.) is nearly
3dwt under the present milling grade. Overhead
however, values are estimated to average lOdwt. to
a height of 50ft. Obviously a big tonnage of stuff
awaits extraction at this point. *
Hainault management (W.A.) has been
letting itself go lately on the subject of mine de-
velopments, after a long period of silence. Mill
supplies are reported to be coming almost entirely
from the eastern side of the property, at the 500 ft.,
600 ft and 750 ft. levels; the lode is said to average
between 15ft. and 20ft., and values are given as
S The manager hopes that further driving, etc.,
liU reveal better ore; but as he has been hoping
that for some time, without getting a turn-up, his
expectations don’t count for as they imgh .
Meantime the struggle to make a do of things
comes more strenuous every day. *
Bullrush Goldr,'Estates’ (W.A.) claims to
be doing better on the Murchison than it did at
Bullfinch. Gold has bCert struck parallel tfitjj j£ e
main workings in its Kyarra option at
whilfe, in the case Of its other venture, at Yuin. the
outcrop Of the reef has been traced for nearly 2 00 Oft.
The old workings, which occupy a central position,
extend for a length of 825 ft., and 600 ft. of this has
sampled 445. lOd. per ton over a width of o±ft. ine
remaining 225 ft. has not yet been opened up. A lot
Of plant is being installed, and the co. is
in a way that gives the impression that it thinks it
has. got hold Of a good mine. Development at depth
will soon settle this point,
* * * *
Commodore (W.A.) has lately got on to
some good stuff in the winze below 300 ft., but the
shoots are so short that values cannot be depended on
an inch ahead of the pick. The distressing frequency
of calls has egged on local scrip-holders to ask what
the co. intends tb do with the few hundred tons of
ore lying loose on the surface: Commodore ore, it is
pointed out, has always crushed well; and juagmg
by what the manager’s progress reports have had to

heads. Poseidon will help up alluvial yields and
Daylesford Will tonic the . quattz, but Bendigo side-
lines still hang fire, and Ballarat East seems hardly
possessed df a kick, # #
North Nuggetty Ajax, Daylesfol-d (Vic.),
starts November with a 3s. dividend, rocked out of
a yield of 14540 z, from 923 tons. To those who like
pondering mysteries, the initial battery return still
presents a conundrum. With that to discount the
test of the yields, seven months’ work has given
78370 z. from 6805 tons, out Of Which £20,000 has
trickled into the shareholders’ pockets. This is a real
persimmon for Ballarat, which how affects the vir-
tuous over the North Nuggetty, claiming that it
never Was, is, or has been an “office float. .Also,
that there was every justification for the creation of
the co. apart from the Nuggetty. This is equivalent
to saying that the British Broken Hill could PUP
the new strike, and then claim that it wasn t an
office float.” The North claim is only 500 ft. long,
and could be worked with the utmost ease as part of
the Nuggetty claim. To hide up the past and to
assure the present, one mining pen-flipper states the
width of the lease to justify a 665. market! that
the flat makes of quartz go across sometimes from
one reef to the parallel lode, may be true, but to
suggest that they float out east and west to the
boundaries is a big bit of humbug. For all this,
with stone from the flat makes averaging good
divs. ahead are certain for a time. For how much
time the Ballarat barometer will indicate the
soonest. #
The old Magdala-cum-Moonlight, Stawell
(Vic.), has been bitten by the epidemic of hustling
which appears to have drifted into Stawell alo n f?
with the modern vacuum-filter plant, now installed
at the Mag.’s slimes dump. Fresh capital has been
acquired, and a general remodelling of the old 30-
head battery is taking place. The system to be
adopted is to crush through 4-to-the-mch gratings,
concentrate the mineral out over tables, and send
the sand to grinding pans and slime the lot. ihe
slime will go to vacuum-filters if, rich enough, ihe
concentrates as of yore will be roasted and cyan-
ided. One thousand tons a week is spoken ot as
somewhere near the mark aimed at.

After hovering on the verge of a settlement
the Mount Lyell trouble has gone on the wing again,
and at the moment it looks like a long fight. Ihe
thing could have been so easily settled, and the men
were so willing to settle it (they even offered to
accept their political opponent, Premier Lewis, as
arbitrator), that it looks very much as though the
directors prefer a shut-down. The inclination to do
this, may be all the greater because (1) of the
growth in the labor unions’ numbers and strength
at Lvell and (2) the low price of copper. lo a
grea/ extent the Broken Hill Prop, and the Lyell
are in the same stable; and the Broken Hill Prop,
directors shut down their mine lately for a couple
of years for two similar reasons. For the past 1U
years copper has averaged £65 13s. 6d. Present
price is about £54. #
From the inside; —“Now that Mount Lyell
has grabbed the strike excuse and dropped the divi-
dend, the Board won’t hustle. The co. s superphos-
phate works won’t wilt merely because Mount Lyell
is idle, for the Chester and the Spanish ores give the
sulphur, and the phosphates come from Christmas
Island. Stieht doesn’t worry, either, on account of
the inevitable flooding of North Lyell ; the one thing
that is upsetting him is the knowledge that any
further drift from Lyell, when miners are short every-
where, means that he may have to concede better
wages to get men to return to the. ram and gehenna
fumes of Queenstown.” # »
David Lumsden, who takes Alfred Mellor’s
chair as secretary of Mount Lyell, is a pawky young
Scot. He swam out here behind Hoover and Loring,
B M and Co.’s leaders. He lived four years with
B ’ m! and Co., so that he is a veteran in a service
notorious for its changes. This paper doesn t be-
grudge Lumsden his appointment; still Syme, who
has a big say in Lyell, may be asked what has be
come of the Age tradition of Australia for the
Australians.” # *
North Dundas (Tas.) built its hopes high
on the flotation of the Dreadnought tin mine. There
was to be a big, energetic co., and J. Bull was to
take a hand. But something went wrong with the
works, and the option has been down.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, is stop-
ing a few tons of stone over No. 1 level, which
carries from 9in. to 15in. of stone. As risen on, this
reef will approach the Brilliant Blocks boundary.
Since the reef was struck in the crosscut in the
Deeps, the co. , has driven a total of 52ft. west and
49ft east. Prospects have been somewhat capricious,
particularly at the eastern end, which traversed a
considerable blank ; at the west end it has frequently
widened out to as much as 44ft. There are 125,000
shares (ss. each), of which 100,000 are contributing.
Brilliant-Stockholm, Charters Towers,
crushed 519 tons for £1930. Prospects in the
Stockholm’s bottom level (No. 10) appear sound At
the old Brilliant P.C. driving is being continued at
the 1435 ft. level; but, although the Day Dawn for-
mation has been followed for 251 ft nothing pay-
able has been met. There is a proved shoot of stone
below 1500 ft. vertical, so a crosscut has been started
at 1596 ft. The few tons broken in a winze which
touched this stone was of fair grade.
* * *
For the past fortnight, East Mexican,
Charters Towers, crushed 605 tons for 26800 z., whien
is hardly so good as recent, returns. The directors
appear confident about the future, for they have
declared a sixpenny bonus, along with the usual 6d.
dividend for December. It isn’t customary to de-
clare a December dividend before the November six-
pence is due; but the Mexican has had a lifetime of
calls, so it is in a hurry. Prospects of the upper
levels getting a payable reef are a trifle more hopeful,
but nothing very definite can be said yet.

“Will the undertaking pav?” The economical
handling and transport of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for
steam-pipes and boilers has been exemplified by a re-

conveyance. Tests made have established the fact
that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this
material, at a pressure of 2001b. per square inch, and
coal at 16s. per ton, will save £7 per year, and
prevent loss of pressure equal to 13.84 B. Th. U. per

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. I be
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake.' Owing, to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

(29/8/1910) : “A young Life Office has many diffi-

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, November 6, 1911.
My Dear Arini. —
The juvenile Skating Carnival, in aid of
Sydney _ Hospital centenary cash box, oc-
curred in the roller-skating premises, which
used to be known as the “Exhibition Build-
ing, in the days when whiskers were the
mode. Mrs. McDonald and Miss Willis sat
in the judgment seat (best fancy dress being
entered for the trial stakes), and handed
out first-prize remarks to the juvenile Shep-
herdess team. Dr. McDonagh’s three little
girls, and a miniature Miss Jack, driven by
small boy Rogers, snatched this prize from
i competitors. The kind of girl every
thrifty young man ought to be looking for
got a prize for. the cheapest and most effec-
tive dress, a nice-looking muslin rag, hand-
painted (by its creator), which cost 2s.
Ve Olde English Faire,” in aid of or-
phans whose religious convictions are Pro-
testant, was opened by the Admiralty lady
in the Town Hall, in the forepart of last
week. Dr. Dill Macky gave the orphans his
biessing and presence, and Sydney’s Mayor
and Mayoress took a fist in promoting the
first day s takings. Financially, this effort
P u t (fiore cash into the treasury of the
King Edward VII. Home for smali Protes-
tant try, is said to have been a success. As
any other kind of effort, it had a melancholy
look ot being heavily draped in wet blankets.
Every other post in the Town Hall had been
prospected in the name of Martin Luther,
r ighting placards, announcing this gentleman
as champion liberator of Europe,” corrected
the impression that Martin had been up aloft
or down in some other place, for centuries,
borne gentleman in some local hall proposed
to lecture on Martin Luther, hence the attack
on the detenceless orphan.
The damsels in the Country Stall ap-
peared to be the only good-looking survi-
vors who had squeezed into the Faire. Pro-
bably they got there unknown to Mr. Luther
Dreary-looking rag stalls, an alleged smithy
full ot underdone drapery, Portsmouth stall
in a blizzard of white calico front, and other
bleak gaieties contributed to the demise of
the Faire at its schedule time on Saturday
evening. J
Mi. Ralph, of Auckland (M.L.), where
the totalisator still blooms in its native
beauty, passed through this hamlet last week
?? t , rail of the §' reat Cup clatter in Vic.
Mr. Ralph is owner of the Huntley coal
mine (M.L.) in his busy moments, and in
his playtime he pursues the horse and other
sporting fixtures with enthusiasm. His
opinion as to whether the tote is as black as
its opponents paint it, or merely drab
trimmed with raven dividends, would be
worth quite one column in any religious
magazine.
The British Navy continues to fortify it-
self financially by marrying into Australian
beer, sheepfolds, wheat and other gold-pro-
ducing paddocks. This time it’s Beer with
a golden foam. An unreliable rumor floated
in some days ago, giving alleged details‘of
religious difficulties concerning the marriage
of Miss Kathleen Toohey to Lieutenant Mor-
timer, of the gunboat Encounter. Having
chopped a well-grown libel out of its middle,
I send you a small portion of the extremities.
"Tlie wedding knot was to have been
pulled into place by the chaplain of the En-
counter, but he had no Australian license be-
yond the bulwarks of his craft, then in Vic-
torian waters. The bride’s home nest—Tor-
rington, Strathfield—was the next sugges-
tion as a roof for the orange blossoming.
That fell through—not the roof, but the sug-
gestion -because the Anglican Archbishop
couldn t let any of his shepherds round up a
wedding party on tne domestic hearth when
a church steeple was less than seven miles
away from the front door-mat. Finally, St
Paul’s, Burwood, an Anglican sheep-fold was
the place. The bridegroom, speeding from
Melbourne to be present at his own wed-
ding, met the Picton railway smash, and lost
his luggage, the sole survivor being his-
sword.
The rumor of an engagement between Mr.
Justice Cohen’s elder son, Edgar, and Miss
Dita Kerr, of Darling Point, is falling over
the edge of eggshell china in that rubber-
tyred neighborhood. Dita is the only daugh-
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Kerr. This
breaking away from the Tents of Israel on
the part of Edgar, in his choice of a Gentile
damsel, hasn’t caused the loud timbrel to
sound to any great extent on Darling Point-
road, but the wedding is alleged to be “ar-
ranged” (the Royal method of mixing two
crowns) for next August.
While the Navy in these waters is rapidly
shedding its junior blue and gold sprigs— not
as alarming sacrifices on the altar rails —
Darling Point maintains a fair average in
the marriage mart. This time it’s the
pretty Eleanor, one of the daughters of Mr.
and Mrs. G. H. Gordon, of Woolly Warialda
and Darling Point-road. Miss Gordon
trotted off, a year or so ago, to see if she
liked any other country better than her
own, and met on India’s colored strand an
Italian gentleman, who’s to be the bride-
groom in the February confetti party.
The Ogilvie girls, from one of Glen Innes’s
large sheep-walks, put in a good time in this
village during the winter hops. One of the
twain, Miss Maud, a dashing rider, was
bidden to the Cup Feast by the G.-G. and
Lady Denman. But the G.-G.’s hospitality
would overflow a palace with elastic sides
and storage for several hundred bodies, so
the girl crossed the border as Lady Bartte-
lot’s guest.
One of the Innes-Noad flock, Joan, is
another young Darling Pointer, whose en-
gagement is mentioned. Mr. Phillip Schuler,
of Melbourne, is the man.
Judge and Mrs. Heydon, who departed for
Europe’s chief cities the other day, are
likely to pull up in front of every opera
house, brass band,, flute., trombone, Italian
organ or drum fight in their line of march. The
legal Heydon, whose' health has been slip-
ping downhill for months, has always taken
a front seat here in matters musical.
The small and dainty Mrs. Reginald
Quesnel, whose feeling for a Paris hat is a
mild religion, is going to tear un her Sydney
roots (the others grew in S.A.), and flit back
to the land of the grapevine and German
sausage. Mrs. Quesnel has just been named
as a person wanted for the Adelaide Conser-
vatorium, where she’s going to fill a chair —
nicely cushioned —as a Professor of Singing.
Some years ago the subiect of this obituary
notice scampered away from the Holy City
to Paris, put herself under the methods of
the old and original Marchesi, studied voice
production and other learned forms of ton-
silitis, came to Sydney (with a letter from
Melba to the late Lady Rawson), taught
Miss R. to trill, and built up a large con-
nection of Aides of the Camp-chair and other
Gov. House bric-h-brac. The unexpected
visitor to Cranbrook, in those davs, who
got into line with the doorbell when the sing-
ing lessons were in full blast, heard an
apparent massacre going on inside. The soft
voice, of Miss Rawson (the alleged victim)
was in the foreground. In the immediate
future, “E-e-ahs, o-o-ohs, a-a-a-” resounded
in plaintive bleats from Gentlemen
Helps, who were secreted in various
cellars, etc., unloading their voice pro-
duction before trolling it out to the little
lady with the 19-inch waist. Professor
Quesnel will join the other Adelaide profs.
—Winsloe Hall is a leading gentleman—
some time in February.
Vida Goldstein has been informing Cork
(Ireland) as to the ways of an Australian
woman at the ballot-box. John Walsh,
M.P., surrendered without firing a shot, and
hauled down his flag as an Anti on the
spot.
Comprehensive color-schemes are just now
the rage amongst the foreign unemployed
rich, and possibly the craze is spreading. I
saw one of our foremost fashionables de-
posited at one of our best stores the other
morning, by a blue motor with red stripes
on it. . When she emerged, she was clad en-
tirely in blue and crimson, and wore under
her arm a blue dog, trimmed with a large
red “Buster Brown” bow.
We don’t hear so much, in these times, of
Judge Docker, the “little brown jug” of
other days—the severe man in whose dis-
honor it was said that an embittered prisoner
once made this outbreak in grammar : “Posi-
tive, dock; comparative, Docker; superla-
tive, gallows.” Country court-loungers don’t,
nowadays, wait for his Draconian sentences
so much as for his elaborate quips. The
latest example comes from Penrith, or there-
abouts. A dog had bitten a person’s leg,
and the “little brown jug” was asked to say
what the refreshment was worth. Then
things ran this way:—
Counsel (to witness) : “What is your name?”
Witness : “James Lean.”
Counsel : “Occupation ?”
Witness: “I’m not working at present.”
Counsel : “What sort of a dog is this?”
Witness : “A cattle tdog.”
Judge: “Ah, that is why it bit the calf.”
Convulsions in the court, of course. Pre-
sently—
His Honor : “Oh, Mr. Lean, I trust you will soon
nna something to do, for if a man does not work
neither shall he eat. Which accounts for you beinsr
lean!”
More convulsions —severely repressed from
the Bench, I don't expect.
Some person or persons, armed with a
sharp tool, is still outside the Law, which,
being three-parts an ass, permits many dan-
gerous wild beasts to roam at large. The
tooLusing creature dug a hole in the elbow
Artemis” of the magnolia plantation
( Violet Teague’s big picture in the Society
°| Women Painters’ show), tore the feathers
or Miss Cusack’s laughing chorus, “The
Coming Morn” (kookaburra orchestra),
scratched the face of “Sweet Sixteen” (Miss
Asquith Baker’s pretty girl), and got through
other minor atrocities.
Two things hit the eye in this ugly busi-
ness. It is said to have occurred on several
successive days, and was, presumably, the
work of some one who had regular access to
the R. A. Society’s rooms where the show
was held. The most injured picture was
hung exactly opposite the main entrance to
the gallery, and in a line with the table at
which one or both secretaries sat. Its pub-
licity was against the success of any surgical
operation until after closing hours or before
the watchdogs were on the chain.
A hairpin (the suggested weapon) is too
blunt to have scratciied the cheeks of Miss
Sixteen as they are scratched. It took a
sharp tool —probably a penknife—to scoop a
hole in Artemis’s elbow-joint. Excepting the
lady poisoner and the woman baby-farmer
(old style), even a vicious woman is usually
too emotional to keep on sticking her knife
into the same place. Some imp of Satan in
breeches has run amok—that’s all. If the
Law does put its large white cotton gloves
on anything in petticoats as the cause of
these punctures, this Sherlock Holmes effort
will need decent burial.
The Girl in the Train” shows every
symptom of filling the front stalls of the Cri-
terion with the Very Best laundered shirt-
fronts for some time to come. One enthusi-
ast is prepared to back the Train Girl’s stay-
ing power against the muscle and stamina
displayed by old “Miss Gibbs,” who beat off
all_ new-comers with both ends of a wild
“Yip.” Florence Young—who grows younger
with the mad procession of the years—is the
Girl, and she sparkles all over with bright
intelligence, wears two frocks any woman
of her own height would steal with alacrity
(if the law allowed it), and twists the Di-
vorce Court Judge (W. S. Percy) round the
heel of her French shoe.
The Train Girl frolic condemns Sybil
Arundale to the dull occupation of being an
uninjured jealous wife, with as much humor
under her first-act bonnet (even the bonnet
is dull) as a wooden doll. Sybil breaks
away from her crushed blue lily pose in Act
I. by falling through, or being poured into, a
muslin skirt (Act II.). This skirt has
ratiier less circumference than a bolster
cover. An inflammatory green satin bodice
—the shade that drives Dr. Dill Macky to
drown his sorrows in strong Boyne waters
with a green bandage round her head, make
that meek Dutch tulip, Mrs. Van Buren
rather a gaudy flower.
A portion of one peacock’s tail stood on
end in the locks of a lady in the front stalls,
on the first night of the Amsterdam and
dyke comedy. The pricking of an osprey
plume tickled the ears of a mild man in
another location, who became less like a
stalled ox and more like a performing acro-
bat as he dodged the feathered ladies near
his bald pate. Mrs. Arthur Allen and a
large, fair Miss Lamb camped in their accus-
tomed first-night haunt. Mr. Frank Daven-
port s head towered over some of the smaller
gilded fry who blocked the passages at 8 p.m.
One of the prettiest heads in the stalls wore
a wreath of tiny roses : —just such a wreath
as Juliet-Melba hung over the balcony at
Her Majesty’s Theatre in Verona —and with
this wreathed beauty was the slim young
Marjory Bowker in Quaker grey wrappings.
A tat lady with a silver sheen round her
shoulders looked like an able-bodied chocolate
emerging from its silver paper. Most of the
other people who weren’t Cupping tried to
squeeze into the Train Girl’s first-night-out
in this city.
About the prettiest pair of feet skipping
across the stage in this city at present are
the property of Winifred O’Connor, who
speeds on them to save the “Chocolate Sol-
dier s” life six evenings per week. On the
evening they presumably carry
YVinifred to church. I’m not sure about
their exact size, but they’re probably two’s,
and a n inch wide across the arch. Wini-
fred s hands-—rather heavy in action—are
less satisfactory. They pat the air in the
automatic McCormack manner.
Mabel Graham, as Mascha, in the Choco-
late Warrior performance, at Her Majesty’s,
shows us a charming Bulgarian damsel in
short skirts, richly upholstered apron and
pert cap. These fittings belong to all coun-
tries which grow large whiskers, small
armies and an annual crop of Macedonian
or other atrocities. Rita Presano, the
plump and handsome Aurelia of the cast,
wears headgear in the last act that looks
like an insurrection in the fowl-yard—the
feathers tearing the air at an angle of 75
degrees above zero. Aurelia adds to this
dome a gorgeous gown, rather below her
knees—a wine-colored shimmery affair, with a
tight fit about the waistline that suggests
the presence of a French dressmaker in the
Mupka Pass. There, or thereabouts, is
Aurelias postal address in the Chocolate
plav.
Mummer H. H. Wallace, of this town,
and of the J.C.W. comic opera co., is at
present resting on a salary, as understudy
to Leslie yaze. H.H.W. took the Gaze part
as the fleeing heir to 13 Swiss hotels, in Mel-
bourne, for nine or 10 nights, with consider-
able applause, and sees no reason to weep
over his desertion of an architect’s trade
for the tootlight business. “It means walk-
ing up and down the face of the earth, and
wondering whether one’s shirts will get home
from the wash before one’s steamer gets to
the next port of call, but I wanted to see
the world, so I don’t mind it. In 1908-9
I toured in Asia with the Hugh Ward Co.,
and had an interesting look in at Burmah,
China and India. The Chows are waking
up very fast —yes, the dragon’s tail will be
a nasty thing to tread on in time to come—
and their commercial honesty makes them
solid in business, as compared with some of
their neighbors. In Shanghai we saw some
queer old superstitions walking about the
streets. For instance, if there’s an acci-
dent, everyone rushes up to see how bad it
is. If the victim looks as if he’d get better
everyone offers help. If he seems in a bad
way, no Ching touches him till the police
come, for the man who first touches a dying
Chinaman in the street will have to pav for
the funeral.”
Marie Lohr, the Sydney-born footlight
beauty, is holding her end up in the Thames
encampment. Critics foam at the nibs over
Marie’s “delightful acting” in “The Marion-
ettes, at the London Comedy Theatre. “The
Marionettes” seem to be rather stiff in their
joints, but the ancient John Hare and
girlish Marie shake them into life. Accord-
ing to the London Referee, the Sydney girl
carries the burden of the play on "her young
shoulders. Australians are snatching a
good many front places, these days, in the
Great Fog. “Why not import some of ’em
back to their native grass plot?”
Violinist F. Mowat Carter has packed up
his fiddle, violently compressed his fair and
numerous locks into a t avelling hat—he is
said to have so much hair that he has to
drive it into his hat with his feet, and then
sit on the belltopper to keep it down —and
left for foreign parts. Mowat Carter is
already a fiddler of considerable tonnage, but
he’s going abroad to add a few more bricks
to his upper storey, and will scour Europe’s
musical capitals for another load of tech-
nique.
Mrs. Charles Calvert, in her recent book,
“Sixty-eight Years of Stage Life,” records
her first meeting with a young “walking
lady,” Miss Mary Seyton, who was filled with
the glamor of the footlights, but left them
to achieve fame as a novelist, under her
real name Braddon. The early failures of
a walking gentleman named Henry Irvin''”
are also served up with stage sauce. °
An Australian girl writes from Great
Britain and Ireland:—
. High-Commissioner George still carried his injured
right in a slmg, when, with pretty girleen Thelma
he took the air at Brighton. George has lost his
sallowness, and taken on a healthy glow All the
same, his lower chest looms as formidably as ever
Ex-Governor Brassey, with the fresh paint ‘of
Earldom thick upon him, fell off his yacht Sunbeam
at Kingstown, and fell into the vice-regal lodge of
the Aberdeens in Dublin. He seems to be wearine-
well. Herself is taking the waters at Harrogate
Rheumatism has bent the proud Vere de Vere form
and, with the aid of a stick, she merely limps along’
Harrogate has also collected Lady Northcote and
Lady Talbot. They all march into their dTps-fa
lean, rakes, rheumatics, derelicts, has-beens, never-
wases, never-can-be’s —a human mass of washing and
washers. 6
The J. C. Williamsons are booked back to Wattle
Land in January. Their two girls will remain in
Paris at school. J.C.W. has taken on a fresh lease
of life, and looks great.
George Edwardes celebrated his 25 years of stage
management by giving a two-step to his little
daughter Nora. The flapper teased her school-girl
plait, and drew her fingers through Early Victorian
curls, tucked up over her ears. But none looked
sweeter than Longstaffs Marjorie, and the J C
Wiliamsons wore a glad smile. Marjorie turned up
her plait, and stepped into a frock of carnation pink
punctuated with rosebuds.
Marie Narelle, looking lovely and slim, hurled
her top C at the Eighty Club banquet, in Dublin
last week.
The Working Girls’ Club displayed its
arms and legs in a physical culture sprint for
a shield in the Sydney Uni.’s Great Hall or
stone sarcophagus, on Saturday afternoon.
Two genuine defence novelties, Captain Par-
sonage and Captain Russell Cook, just out;
from the banks and braes of bonny Bull,
and Miss Wilton (of Shirley) were the
judges. The Girls disguised their bloomers
with short pleated skirts, and the visitors
could only guess the knee measurement of
these young Dianas of the local crossways.

That the hand of our old friend, Mr. Davis, has not lost its cunning is proved
bevond doubt by “The Book of Dan,” which has just been published.
Dan, the son of Dad, has grown to man’s estate, and developed many humorous
peculiarities, which land him in particularly tight corners, out of which he generally
manages to extricate himself like a veritable Napoleon of the Bush. Dan is a
“character,” and his sense of humor is not always the same as the other fellow s, but
it will assuredly tickle the reader to tears.
Of this book there is no doubt; it is bound to become a favorite.
Over £lO,OOO Worth of “On Our Selection” and “Our New

The ,/Eolian Orchestrelle is suitable in size, appearance and
range of cost for practically any home.
It virtually gives you control over many different orchestral
instruments. It confers on you the ability of a trained organist
and an orchestra leader combined.
With the Orchestrelle you can play what music you like, sym-
phony, overture, oratorio, musical comedy, dance or song. You
can have an organ recital when you will, and enjoy the superb rich-
ness, the majesty, the mellow beauty of the pipe organ.
Or you can devote an entire evening to grand opera, and play
your favorites, using the strings, reeds, horns and brasses to give
the true orchestral coloring and charm.
The Hiolian Orchestrelle is unique. There is no other
instrument like it.
It is made in many different styles, bearing approximately the
same relation to one another as orchestras of few or many pieces.
As an example, the Style O Orchestrelle has tones suggestive
of “Muted Strings,” “Violins,” “ Flutes,” “ Piccolos,” “Trumpets”
and “ Basses.”
While the larger model, known as Style “ W,” adds to these
such Orchestral voices as the “ ASolian Harp,” the “ French Horn,”
the “Orchestral Flute,” the “Oboe,” the “Viola” and the
Trombone.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, November 6, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Derby Day, blue and windless, made
a fine weather beginning for the an-
nual Flemington spree. The galloping
day really started at 10 o’clock in
the morning, in Collins-street, when the first
flight of raceward motors buzzed into town
laden with people dressed and financed for
the sacrifice. The lawn was carpeted early
with animated dress models and tailor’s Cup
advertisements, and the vice-regal box over-
flowed. Both Denman and Fuller came along
and brought the Bosanquets, of South Aus-
tralia, and Barron, of the Flyspeck. The
usual swarm of aides circled round and
helped to congest the reserved pen. Fortun-
ately, most of them are tall and thin, so the Tr
pack closely. There is bound to' be trouble
and international complications when some
future Excellency imports a stout, bulgy
staff.
The Denman lady, who is a keen sport,
was robed in bright red. with yellow stripes.
1 only say this because her dress looked
black to me, while two other papers allege
that it was blue. So I am driven to a com-
promise. She carried the very latest thing
in field glasses, with which she followed the
races. Lady Fuller, in a gala dress of green
and pink, wore her hair spread in two wide
wings under a large hat. The pretty Bartte-
lot dame tucked a mignonette hat ribbon
under, her chin, and wore a short white silk
muslin dress. The .Bosanquet lady, gowned
in blue, waved blue or mauve plumes in her
grey hat.
The lawn turned as one woman to gaze at
the Rupert Clarke lady, in ivory lace and
gold-patterned snoes. She looked demurely
out from a Miss Muffit hat that had frills
down to the level of tb,e eyes. Phyllis Clarke-
Power scored a startling Union Jack effect,
with a red tunic, folded over a blue dress
with dabs of white. The Powers were in
high fettle, for the Derby victory of Wilari
(50 to 1) was the first win Herbert Power
had had for some time.
There were a goodly number of tea parties
under the elms. A spotted Fisken, in navy
and leopard markings, poured tannin for a .
swagger crowd. Mrs. Dr. Joyce presided
over a table in a grey and rose chiffon dress,
with an attentive husband at her elbow. Mrs.
L. Mackinnon, under a hat trimmed with
tulle, made some people glad with straw-
berries ; and Mrs. Frank Stirling, in black
with a lancer-plumed helm, partied with Mrs.
Harry Hilliard, in pale green and a hat
trimmed with nodding pink roses. Dorothy
Vane Menzies had a green baize, hat q.nd a
parasol as long as a billiard cue; and Mrs.
Keating, smartly frocked in black, promen-
aded with her Senator husband. A favorite
choice in head trimmings consisted of grasses
and feathers' standing straight up savage
fashion. One daring tea-taker wore lace and
chiffon between the outer, world and her silk-
tighted limbs. There were almost enough
feathers in her hat to make a cloak; but,
apparently, she did not desire any superflu-
ous coverings.
A pretty little Bosanquet girl, aged about
17, graced the vice-regal pen. She has blue
eyes and black curly hair, and was hatted in
a dainty, blue-lined mushroom.
The Austral Salon last week put on its
best alpaca, and welcomed the Denman lady,
as chief patroness, in a subdued voice. The
Salon does not appear to have recovered
from the shock it sustained when a learned
Judge inquired of a barrister: “But what is
the Austral Salon?”
A stiffly official piece of gorgeousness
was the Naval and Military Club dance, on
Friday night. There was no chance for the
frivolous young person out for a well-
scribbled programme and an evening’s trip-
ping, as the nimble young warriors were en-
gpp'ed three-quarters of a programme deep in
duty dances with the sisters, cousins and
aunts of their various chiefs. Still, the
youngsters couldn’t very well complain, as
they had had the time of their lives at Mrs.
Stewart Murray’s dance in that same hall a
few nights previously. G.-G. Denman and
Governor Fuller brought their respective
Governoresses and a string of aides; and the
Cup squadron in the offing emptied a few
boatloads of blue-and-gold representatives on
to the polished floor. Most of the vice-regals
departed early; but two aides stayed on and
danced till the last note died away. Mrs.
Kirkpatrick, wife of the Inspector-General,
wore one of the most taking frocks. It was a
sort of chain mail embroidered with bullets
—or some sort of ornaments closely resem-
bling bullets. The Denman lady wore dia-
monds and black, and Lady Fuller pearls
and white. ' ) j :•" ■
One frivol of the season was washed
clean off the engagement book. The
Fuller Government House planned a moon-
light garden party; for one evening last week;
but the weather broke down badly, and,
when the hour arrived, a pale-faced moon
looked down on sodden and deserted lawns.
Female Society was much upset by the dis-
aster, as it had made arrangements to appear
in low-necked dresses and large hats —a rig
which is most effective at night out of doors,
when half-lights are kind to faded com-
plexions and other handicaps. The aides'
spent hours at telephones, getting the news
of the postponement through to the invited.
On November 25, after the dust raised by
the expensive horse scramble has settled,
Lady Denman will open a garden fete, in aid
of the Women’s Home Missions, at Ottawa,
the Toorak house of the horsey Campbells.
At a meeting, held at Federal Government
House, on October 31, it was decided to
re-form (mind the hyphen!) the Melbourne
Polo Club. G.-G. Denman was elected presi-
dent, and Sub-Excellency Fuller and John
Madden vice-presidents. The small Captain
Nutting was given the job of secretary, and
Ernest Bruce was told to get a cash-box and
commence treasuring. The new club holds
out the glad, gloved hand to all members of
the old organisation. The old playing-
ground (Moonee Valley) is to be used —also
Kooyong and the green, level stretches of
Albert Park. The G.-G.’s team was to have
met Mr. “Ebo” Browne’s on November 8,
but the dislocation of our horsey ruler’s collar-
bone. (it occurred in p practise game on
Tuesday), has presumably altered all that.
The injured G.-G. will,not, swing a. pqlo, stick
for a month at least.
The Aberdeen liner Demosthenes indulged
in a marine party, on Friday evening, at
Port Melbourne. The guests were brought
to the tall ship’s gangway by special train ;
and, when they had climbed, the swaying
stairs, with the assistance of nice, brass-
bound juniors, Captain Robb shook them by
the hand. The fluffy crowd trickled like
honey into every crevice of the boat. Pairs
who knew their way about either climbed up
to see the wireless, or down to inspect the
submarine signalling apparatus. On the
upper deck, various singing people warbled
doggedly ; but the listeners remained grouped
to windward, in spite of the attempts of
anxious seamen to shift them. The result was
that much good melody blew overboard un-
heard. The wind—which wasn’t on the pro-
gramme—howled and whistled through every
crevice, and those fortunate ones who had
them snuggled thankfully into furs and
wraps. While Horace Stevens was thunder-
ing out a sea song, the shunting trucks on
the pier below kept up a clashing, Wag-
nerian accompaniment. De Gilio’s orches-
tra refused to be drowned, and broke out
into a waltz when the singing was con-
cluded. The concert then became a dance.
Supper was served amongst heaped-up roses.
The Fiskens are holding an opposition
party to Mrs. Phyllis Reggie Power’s, on
Steeplechase Sunday. As they both know
the same set of people, the guests will spend
a. good part of the afternoon on the road be-
tween South Yarra and Toorak. Once, in
the dear, dead days, pretty Mrs. Herbert
Power and the Como Armytages held rival
functions. The result was that the real
party happened on the Toorak-road. It did
not occur to anyone to select a special “At
Home”; they divided their time evenly be-
tween both, and so missed enjoying either.
The Fullers and Maddens are lending their
patronage and presence to a farewell draw-
ing-room concert to Professor Freddie Beard,
who is shortly departing to Europe for a
trip. It is to be partly a rest and partly a
skirmish for fresh ideas in the most intensely
musical haunts. A good programme is pro-
mised. The place is the Masonic Hall, and
the time Wednesday, November 22.
Miss Joan Dolores Innes-Noad, of Darling
Point, Sydney, has made the usual affirma-
tive response to Phillip Schuler, only son of
editor Schuler, of Melbourne Age. The two
make a plunge into the wedded state at an
early date.
The returned voyager continues to alight on
the wharf, with half a ton or so of luggage.
The widow McEacharn. is one of the most
recent homers. Goathlands being sold, she
is taking the sea breezes at the Esplanade
Hotel, St. Kilda.
Mrs. T. H. Kelly is showing the inmates
of the Grand some dazzling jewels. She
wears lovely pearls to breakfast, and adds
diamonds at lunch. By dinner and opera
time, a few black pearls provide some ex-
pensively restful contrast to the glittering
accumulation.
Dr. Davenport is losing his daughter and
close companion for a spell. She goes to the
Northern Territory with Professor Spencer’s
party.
A comfortably-situated young city man has
alarmed his friends on ’Change by a bad
nervous breakdown. After some weeks
spent in hospital, he is now starting on the
usual sea voyage, during which his people
hope he will get rid of the idea that he is
penniless. As the .sick man’s pretty young
wife is abroad, his brother-in-law is accom-
panying him. ,
Bessie, the golden-haired eldest girl of
Parson Crawford, of Brighton, has returned
from Broken' Hill with a sparkling ring on
the third finger of her left hand. Wilson is
the lucky fiance’s name.
Mrs. Stewart Macarthur and Mrs. Colin
McCulloch are both playing chaperone this
season to beauty daughters, who are taking
their first turns in the great social game.
Mrs. Norman Armytage helped to congest
Society’s engagement book with a dance on
Cup night. As her own house would not
hold such an extensive affair, Mrs. Frank
Brett supplied the floor.
Dollie Parker, daughter of the Chief Jus-
tice of Westralia, came to Melbourne for the
Cup revels. She is staying with the Reggie
Powers.
Mary, daughter of Solicitor Frank Brett,
is another girl who is wearing a diamond
half-hoop ring. The man is Captain Clegg,
of some Hussar regiment or other, a visitor
from the Big Soot. He is reported to be
rich. Some say he has £lO,OOO a year;
some say £5OOO is the correct figure; modest
people guess it at about £3OOO. But no-
body accuses him of not being extremely well
off.
Mrs. John Grice left last week for a trip
to Colombo with May, the Dick Grice
girleen, and a doctor son, who is returning
Londonwards after a trip to Australia.
Last Wednesday, Mary McKinley, young-
est daughter of the late editor of Punch,
had her name changed to Ritchie. A gay
gathering pumphandled the beaming bride-
groom and the pretty little bride, who
dimpled in white satin and real lace.
Reginald Jennings, a master at the Mel-
bourne Preparatory Grammar School, is
responsible for a book of schoolboy’s stories
entitled “Told in the Dormitory.” Every
“Grammar” youngster feels a pride in the
possession of the volume, as the tales it
contains were told to him before they ap-
peared between covers.
Jean Robertson, Agar Wynne’s rich and
much-travelled stepdaughter, is returning to
her native Dud shortly, but only to say
good-bye. She is booked to marry a Ceylon
tea planter named Cotter.
One of the weddings of the season was the
recent Wollaston-Michie joining. Beatrice,
daughter of the late wool-wealthy A. D.
Michie, and granddaughter of Archibald, of
the same ilk, and Spencer, son of Dr. Wol-
laston, of the Customs, were the contracting
parties. Canon Drought did the job at St.
John’s, and Society followed along to the
subsequent reception at Glenbervie, uncle
Yencken’s Toorak house. Two Yencken
cousins acted as bridesmaids, and Ellis Lock-
yer made up the attendant group to three.
Guy Madden and Jack McComas supported
the bridegroom. Toorak threw roseleaves
after the pair, who motored away l —the bride
in an amethyst silk dress and lilac-trimmed
leghorn hat. Mrs. Yencken gave a dance to
finish up the day for the bridesmaids and
guests.
Rupert Clarke and wife occupied a box at
“Lady Frederick,” on Derby night. The
boxed lady was in white, with a beautiful
osprey about 2ft. high in her hair. It was
a delicate, spray-like thing, Which waved as
she moved, and gave a very fine imitation of
a fountain playing on a day of light breezes.
Every night of the non-Melba opera, so
far, has been graced by Melba, boxed and in
sumptuous garments. She is invariably
visited by vice-royalty or a representative
aide.
One Girl’s idea of it: —
The Yarra Henley has caught on amazingly, and
we all manage to get a lot of perilous amusement
out of it. Yet, despite its popularity, it is a pain-
fully spasmodic and jerry-built imitation. It com-
mences about a week before the appointed date- with
a storm of art muslin and paper flowers, rages for one
short afternoon, and vanishes as a string of grimy,
commerce-battered lighters and punts go down-
stream. Even the rich clubs and people have not yet
acquired permanent houseboats to ask their guests to.
A number of nice houseboats would furnish the river
throughout the year and act as summer camps and
tangible reminders of the big river festival. But
nobody with money seems anxious to float any pre-
sentable edifices of the kind. Perhaps they would be
induced to do so if Premier Weary went ahead with
the suspended river improvements, and made it pos-
sible for boats to get past Dight’s Falls, and so reach
the really picturesque parts of the river, where the
willows lean down to the water,- and there is more •
poetry and less drain in the surroundings. The “Pre-
pare To Meet Thy God” notice, painted by some
fiend on a face of rock, might be obliterated in the
interests of nervous boaters; also helmeted mission-
aries might be sent out to convert the hostile small
boy savage who; pelts passing craft from bridges and
high banks. The practice of drowning the house cat
in the hard-worked stream might be discouraged, and
bathing, without a costume fiercely prohibited. (I
remember one religious picnic which had to cower
behind umbrellas while the curate landed and remon-
strated with a tribe of river pirates who were swim-
ming in the altogether.) Until a heap of improve-
ments are made in surroundings and manners, I am
afraid Henley will continue to be a fraudulent imi-
tation of the real article.
Lizzie Newbold, the soprano with the hieh
note that requires to be inspected from the
topmost rung of an electric fire ladder, has
returned to her native aviary to "give con-
certs and repay the syndicate, headed by
Mrs. S. T. Staughton and Mrs. Harper,
which sent her to Paris to study. The little
singer is a hard worker, and deserves success.
Gerald Massey, a very likeable “music,
song and story” merchant, will be showing
his wares at the Masonic "Hall on Wednes-
day, the 15th. The entertaining Gerald is
to have assistance from Claude Hall and a
lady accomplice, in an incidental playlet, and
also from Hal Gye, who will dash off two
or three character sketches, and give a note
of diversity to the programme.
Now that summer approaches with lag-
ging footsteps and frequent cold blasts, the
aldermen of the various seaside suburbs are
sitting up late framing bylaws and making-
other preparations for the mixed bathers.
Fierce electric arc lamps are to sizzle like
the commanders of Purity Brigades on the
dark stretches, and light the way of the
prowling plain-clothes policeman. , dry
promenading will be allowed; so the girl who
gets herself up like a French beachcomber
out of a fashion rag will either have to
bathe and ruin the costume, or retire to the
dressing shed and resume her pneumonia
blouse and tight hobhle skirt. The poor, dry
rpermaid who casts shy glances at nice young
men will render herself liable to prosecution
for “unseemly behavior.” If the morals of
the bathing public go to the sharks this sum-
mer, it will not be for want of fussing on the
part of Bumble and Townpump. A nice
stretch of beach, in the eyes of most coun-
cillors, is not a gift from the Creator—it is a
temptation left by Beelzebub.
The ’"«t despairing shriek of <a harassed
woman: —
Girl, generally useful, wanted for Sandring-
ham. SPLENDID HOLIDAY ; light duties; no
washing. , Victoria St., N. Melbourne.
If that doesn’t bring Marianne to the door-
knocker, then Victoria-street, N. Melbourne,
will have to turn-to itself.
Jessie Row, a “just out” daughter of the
Rows of Duhallow (and Goldsbrou°-h, Row
and Mort), is engaged to a Mr. Richards, of
the Leishman tea people, in Colombo. After
the wedding bells have ceased, and the scat-
tered confetti has blown away, the pair will
pick out a nice nesting spot on the Coral
Strand.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
The Glenelg and Victoria Drive Bowling Clubs de-
clared themselves open last Saturday, and the Adelaide
Rowing Club did likewise on the Torrens. The neonle

Dr. Marten, by the way, is deserting his home on
North Terrace. He finds it too noisy. The Lendons
and Poultons are about the only two medicoes who
still cling to the fetich of both living and doing busi-
ness on North Terrace. The rest have fled to Subur-
bia and quiet nights. Which reminds me that Won-
dergraph is building for itself a theatre on the above
thoroughfare. The job is being done on the American
quick-lunch system, and a flaring placard invites the
public to watch and see it grow. The leap skywards
is occurring just opposite the Exhibition building
where the Dandies are announced to cheer our jaded
minds as they did last summer. Claude Dampier
will conduct the show.
Clytie Hine, who studied singing at our local cou-
servitorium, has made extremely good at the Royal
Academy of Music (London). She has just secured
an engagement at the CoVent Garden Grand Opera
House. Gwen Pelly is another of our musical pro-
digies who has done well for herself in foreign parts.
In anticipation of the Irving vis't, a section of the
populace has been going Hamiet-mad, of late
The epidemic -is looked on with an enthusiastic
eye by the booksellers, who, as a result thereof, dis-
pose of a lot of ordinarily unsaleable Shakspearian
literature. A Shakspeare student, who runs a “Shaks-
peare Salon,” was commissioned by the management
t* secure supers the other day.' Sufficient stage-
struck Adelaidians rolled up, in answer to his advt.,
to fill all the needs in the super line of half a dozen
Drury Lane bellowdramas.
The Governor and Lady Bosanquet gave a reception
on Tuesday night, before their departure for the
Cup. It was mainly official, with a faint leaven of
mere Blood or Haw. A reception, talk, supper, and
more talk, followed in quick succession, and by 11
p.m. the last carriage had departed, and the vice-
regalities were murmuring the gubernatorial equiva-
lent of “Ooray! Thank ’Evings that’s over.” The
flowers were a revelation —exquisite blooms arranged
by an artist hand. Lady Bosanquet looked her hand-
some best, in a dress which gave a vague impression
of primrose and pale blue and exquisite lace. Miss
Bosanquet was in white.
The Ways had a garden party at Montefiore on
Wednesday, to give the British and Foreign Bible
Society people a chance to meet one Rev. H. Taylor.
A delightful odor of sanctity, or something, brooded
over the entertainment. On second thoughts, it
might have been the flowers for which Montefiore is
famous. Anyhow, it was there, and so were Lady
Bosanquet and a few of Society’s leading lights.
Miss Rose Macpherson’s portrait of Miss Catherine
Spence was unveiled at the Art Gallery by Ladv
Bosanquet on Tuesday afternoon. Mrs. Young, who
was for years Miss Spence’s right-hand woman, took
a prominent part in the proceedings. The balance
of the cash collected is to go towards the, establish-
ment of a scholarship, which the Government is to
subsidise.
Mr. Tennyson Smith—who would fain prohibit us
from drinking anything but water—is billed to meet
Paris Nesbit, K.C., shortly, and discuss the pros, and
cons, of the Der-rink question. There will be a mock
trial, with Drink as the criminal. The betting, so
far, is five million to one on an acquittal, Nesbit
being for the defence.
The Symons are back from England, looking well
and strong. The lady, as Presidentess of our Wattle
League, essayed to land some samples of the herb
in England. However, it didn’t take kindly to the
cold storage- chamber, and so she is devising some
other means of advertising our floral emblem
amongst the peoples overseas.
The tuneful lady, who at the other end of the
earth was known as Madame Georgina Delmar, and
at this end is the wife of Professor Winsloe Hall, of
the Adelaide ’Varsity Conservatorium, has been ap-
pointed by the ’Varsity Council to teach singing at
the place where her husband teaches various other
pleasant noises.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

SHOOTING SCIATICA
Tortured by sharp, hot pains
in Hip and Legs,
This man crippled till he had
to give up athletics.
Tells how he was cured.
In the case of Mr. Arthur J. Grice, a pro-
minent Tasmanian athlete, living at Duffield
Street, Queenstown, he was: compelled to
abandon football and sport by recurring
attacks of Sciatica. After long suffering
Mr. Grice was completely cured by Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills. As Sciatica, like Neural-
gia, is a disorder of the nerves, the direct
treatment to cure the cause aims at restor-
ing the nerves to their proper state of tone.
Hot applications cannot do this. As Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills make new blood and
tone the nerves, they have achieved great
success in curing Sciatica, and Mr. Grice’s
case is a striking instance. He said:—
“Up to the age of 23 I was always strong
and healthy and a well-known athlete. From
that time forward I was compelled to give
up all sport, such as running, football, etc.,
owing to repeated attacks of Sciatica in the
right hip, extending to the right knee. I
consulted several doctors, who prescribed for
me some medicine to take; some blistering
me and giving me lotions. The blistering
was so spvere that it took all the skin off my
hip to the knee. The pain at times was well
nigh unbearable. It was very sharp, like
needles being pushed into the flesh. I used
to be worse at night, especially if I got wet
or had been working in water. The sciatic
nerve was very tender to the touch. The
attack used to vary, sometimes lasting for a
week or more, and at other times for a
day or so. It was always a burning pain;
walking would irritate it. The muscles
wasted away. I had been in this state for
about 10 years, and whenever it came on I
used to consult the doctors, but without re-
ceiving permanent relief, and had come; to
the conclusion that it would come and go
whenever it liked. Eventually a fellow work-
man who had been cured of Sciatica after
being bedridden for three weeks, advised me
to give Dr. Williams’ Pi'jk Pills a trial, as
they had cured him. I got a box, and bene-
fited so much from their use I kept on with
them, and by the time I had taken four
boxes I felt completely cured. That is
nearly two years since, and I am happy. to
say I have never had a twinge or any sign
of the complaint since, and I can conscien-
tiously recommend Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
to anyone suffering as I did, or for any
other complaint arising from a disorder of
the blood, as I have known several who have
benefited by their use.” „

POLITICAL
POINTS
Packer, who abandoned unionism to become
a hired official of the Free Workers’ Asso-
ciation, is putting up for Williamstown
(Vic.), and the waterside suburb isn’t tak-
ing the compliment kindly. You can hear
Packer’s meetings a mile off, but you can’t
hear Packer three feet away. The papers
say the refusal of the people to listen to
Packer’s opinions is outrageous. Perhaps it
is Packer’s turn to listen to the people’s
opinions.
A few weeks ago, a Commission recom-
mended that Tasmania should receive from
the Commonwealth a special payment of
£900,000 to cover losses supposed to have
been sustained by careless accountancy in
the bookkeeping days. Now the Tas. Coun-
cil of Churches proposes that the money
should only be paid if the State Government
agrees to abolish Tattersall’s. In other
words, the money is said to be due without
any conditions, but the Tas. Council of
Churches proposes that Australia should
swindle the adjacent island unless the island
agrees to snuffle with the same snuffle that
Australia snuffles with. And, apparently, it
doesn’t see anything mean or utterly degrad-
ing about the proposed robbery. Possibly,
it is even proud of itself.
DANGER OF NEGLECTED OBESITY.
That there is great danger to health in
neglecting obesity every authority admits.
The heart is the first organ seriously
affected, but in course of time there is a
general organic disturbance; the entire 1 sys-
tem is congested, especially the digestive
machinery, and there is trouble without end.
Why risk these evils when there is so pleas-
ant, so harmless, so reliable a remedy for
over-fatness as Marmola Prescription Tab-
lets? Compounded of the principles enum-
erated in the world-known Marmola Pres-
cription (but in dry, condensed form) these
little tablets are of full strength and re-
ducing efficacy, and, taken regularly, are
capable of removing many pounds’ weight of
superabundant fat in quite a short time- —
both the internal excess of hampering fat
and the disfiguring excess under the surface.
The face is rebeautified by this elimination
of puffing-out fat, the figure is greatly im-
proved, the waist and hip measurement cor-
rected, while the limbs regain their slender
mould. The dose is one tablet after each
meal and one at bedtime. Marmola Pres-
cription Tablets are sold by chemists, price
3s. 6d., or, post free, of the,. Marmola Com-
pany, , 5 and 7 Barrack. Street, Sydney,

Concerning the purchase of land, by
Arthur Griffith, Ma State’s Minister for
Public Works, at Uhr’s Point, Port Jack-
son :
McCourt, M.L.A. (in the Assembly, 19/10/’ll) :
There is no doubt that if the Government referred
the land as a site for Government dep6t yard and
workshops to Richardson and Wrench and Raine and
Horne, not one of them would value the 97 acres at
more than £2OO per acre. They could not do it.
Richardson and Wrench, Ltd. (in the Sydney
dailies, 26/10/’ll) : We estimate the market value of
the land as a site for Government depot yard and
workshops as on August 10, 1911, at £4750 ( £5OO
odd per acre !).
Raine and Horne (same date, same place) : We
consider the Minister has made a fair purchase at
£4500 !
Two days later, Liverpool Plains, where Hen-
ley, M.L.A. and others had been laying
charges against Minister Griffith in connec-
tion with the sale and purchase of the site,
returned the Government’s candidate with
great enthusiasm.
The recent blowing-out, by independent
assessors, of T. ’Enley, M.L.A., and his
charge against the N. S. Wales Ministry, of
gross overpayment when purchasing Ulir’s
Point, Sydney, for a timber depot, was the
third hoist recorded against the same indi-
vidual within a few weeks. The first occa-
sion was when he volunteered the informa-
tion that, according to a report obtained by
the City Council of Sydney, the Kiama
metal quarry, purchased by the State, was
composed, not of blue metal, but of shale.
Minister for Works Griffith at once wrote
to the Town Clerk for verification, and
found that there was nothing in the report
that would bear out the statement. That
was No. 1. No. 2 was the announcement
that the quarry had been hawked about and
offered to the City Council for £3500 less
than the State paid for it. It proved that
the quarry had been offered for sale only on
one occasion ; that was to the City Council,
and the price asked was exactly the same as
was asked from the Government —£18,000.
In regard to reliability of information re-
ceived, Henley is rapidly qualifying for a
job in Callaghan’s police force.
THE N.S.W. DEMOCRATIC
PARTY—ALL THAI' IS LEFT.
Premier Murray’s policy speech at Warr-
nambool was the longest that any Premier
has inflicted on Victoria since the days of
William Shiels. And Murray, unfortu-
nately, can’t talk like Shiels. Sometimes
Shiels didn’t say much, but he could say no-
thing beautifully—almost as beautifully as
Deakin. Murray can also say nothing, but
he says it anyhow. Shiels sounded like a
peal of silver bells. Murray sounds more
like something falling downstairs.
THE DEATH
TUBE.
Dr. Ashburton Thompson, president of the Board of
Health, stated though no specific diseases fvere at-
tributable to the tube nursing bottles, they were' a
prolific source of sickness, and eventual death to
infants. —News item.
Ex-Nurse Wade : “ Now, my dear, nevei
mind what people say. Take a 'little more
out of this bottle.”
In spite of its long run of wonderfully
good years, Victoria still has an accumu-
lated deficiency of £314,075 to wipe out.
THE PRELIMINARY EXAM.
Parliaments are somtimes returned in which the
sense of the country finds such a blurred and imper-
fect reflection that they utterly fail to translate the
intelligent public will into law. There is nothing
else to be expected when the ballot-box is turned
into a tribunal for trying charges of administrative
misdemeanor instead of determining broad issues of
public policy.—(Sydney Telegraph.
The Bad Egg: “ Gerrout, you with yer
microscope an’ political record , indeed!
Ain’t it quite enuff for you that I’m suit-
able and fit in gen’ral form to occupy yer
blamed ole vacancy at all!”
John Bull’s dear imported Freetrade loaf,
about which he has been so much agitated of
late, is likely to be still .dearer this coming
year. Russia is the country on which Bull
now mainly relies for his sustenance, and the
Russian harvest has failed so badly that the
Government has already voted over £9,000,000
to save the cultivators from starvation.
The Age tends of late to cut itself free
from Democracy. It now appears as the
champion of Victoria’s House of Rich Land-
lords, and warmly reproaches
John Weary for his feeble pro-
posals re the reform of that mil-
dewed institution. “The grounds
of attack are obviously insuffi-
cient,” says the Age ; “the
Council has of late confined its
Toryism within comparatively
inoffensive bounds, and to at-
tack it without due cause would
be downright folly.” Not con-
tent with turning in his grave,
Syme may be expected to
resurrect himself, when he sees
his paper ensconcing itself be-
hind the ancient Tory embattle-
ments at which he bit all his
life with the assiduity of a lit-
erary white ant.
In view of the alleged skedaddle of capital
out of Australia, this item, from the Sydney
Telegraph’s London letter last week, is in-
teresting:—
The London Stock Exchange has been of especial
interest during the past few months. . .With one
single exception,, all securities have shown a heavy
loss. And that exeepti6'n"has been in the securities of
Australia. . . Only Australian securities maintained the
position they held at the beginning of the summer. . .
In fact, Australia has done somewhat better than
hold her own. In a number of instances shares have
actually improved during the recent troubled season.
Wherefore this paper remarks briefly:
“Hooray!”
The old gag about party government at
’Ome was that “it is the dooty of the Hop-
position to hoppose” ; but the most successful
leaders of Oppositions—
Parkes, for example—
knew what to oppose,
and what to let slide.
The confused politician.
Wade, on the other
hand, has a dog-like
idea that he must bark
at everything—so he
barks at every baker’s
cart that comes from
the Government side.
Which naturally is
making people very sick
of party government—
and of Wade. A dog
that doesn’t know better
than to bark at the
butcher and the baker is
a good dog to give
away, even if you have
to throw in a small bag
of bricks.
Nominations for seats on the Melb. City
Council were received the other day, and
the lethargic citizens took so little interest
in the matter that seven out of the eight
retiring councillors were returned unop-
posed. Nothing but a thorough democratisa-
tion of the franchise, or the establishment
of a Greater Melbourne Council will give
the city effective municipal government. Not
one of the representatives lives in the city;
mostly they dwell in the outermost suburbs,
though Sammy Gill ott still secludes himself
in his prison-walled mansion at the top of
Brunswick-street, just outside the city
proper.
PORTLAND BAY, VICTORIA
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Has any man beheld, by cliff or coast,
The Ships of My Desire—their pennons streaming f
Here at mine Open Gate
1 dwell alone, and ivait —
I There is Prosperity?—long dead and lost—
In vain I pray for statesmen and redeeming!”
I hear the Harbor sighing for the Ships That Never
Come—
The ships that pass her by with smoke-wreaths
trailing;
Sings the Seaport so to me,
And the protest of the sea
Thunders loudly, but none heareth —all the hearts of
men are numb.
And... Portland Bay is shipless and her yearnings
unavailing! ,
Her waters wait for Commerce in the South —
Her mile-long piers, that call 'in vain for Argos;
The people dream and die,
For sail and steam go by—
Greed, alas ! and ancient Cunning—they have stopped
the Statesman’s mouth,
And a Single Seaport swallows ships and cargoes!
ONE over-crowded City, where Too Many People
dwell—
One octopus that battens on its plunder ;
Crowded piers and water-way—
Silent, shipless Portland Bay,
O Lord, will ne’er a Statesman ring the Vampire-
City’s knell,
And wake the Nation’s soul ere All Goes Under?
The Lighthouse flashes lonely o'er the sea—
Strange rays, that gleam in vain and surely
wasted ;
The passing of the years,
And the rotting of the piers—
Lord, are men crazed, and under ban of Thee? —
What does this Sea-Lamp here —-what madman's
jest has placed it?
For the shipless Harbor slumbers, and its piers exist
in vain—
Thrice-damned is Portland Bay by “statesmen’s”
orders;
Who will avenge the crime?—
Swift comes the Voting-Time,
Pass, “statesmen” all, with scurvy gods of Gain—-
This Land, in place of ye, needs more Asylum-
Warders !
“Has any man beheld a madder host—
Are These' the Land’s Desire, their jawbones wav-
ing?
A crazed Asylum-Team,
So. . .1 slumber here, and dream —
My Ocean-Gate is Empty, and the ancient ghost
Of Vanished Trade is stalking ’midst their Rav-
ing !”
Who hears the Sea-Gate’s Question? —for the Ships
of Her Desire
Still pass far-off, with smoke-wreaths trailing;
From the howling M.L.A.
This is certain- —Portland Bay
Calls for Justice, but that brain-disordered choir
Still continues wrecking seaports—Prayers Like
Hers Are Naught Availing!

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Melbourne Cup, a handicap sweep-
stakes of 30 sovs. each, with 7000 sovs., and a
trophy, valued at 100 sovs., added, was run, as usual,
the first Tuesday in November. And the Result was
another disaster for the heavily-weighted nags. The
top weight was 9st. 91b., and the favorites, Trafalgar
and Comedy King, were not in it —not even for a
place. The prize and the glory and the splosh went
to The Parisian, carrying Bst. Jib. in the person lof
jockey Cameron. Second and third places fell to
Flavian, ridden by G. Lambert, and Didus, steered
by Smith. Both carried 7st. 51b.
* * * *
The first day of the V.R.C. meeting would
have left tens of thousands of punters dead on the
field, so to speak, but for the gallant conduct of
Prizefighter in winning the Hotham Handicap from
end to end. The “second-string” Cup horse from
Lynch’s stable started favorite, and, being favored
with the inside running, whilst several of the other
candidates were obviously not on the job, he gave
his backers no anxiety whatever. Apart from Prize-
fighter’s gallop, the way of the punters was as hard
as the heart of a self-made millionaire. In the
Maribyrnong Plate the Malster blood, full of the red
corpuscles of precocious speediness and strength, as-
serted itself for the third time in six years. Gold
Brew, by Malster-Diffidence, won fairly and squarely,
the two Traquair fillies, Ventura and Deeside, who had
seemed wonderful in their flutters of three weeks
ago, failing to stay the five furlongs. Little Ventura
had a 101 b. penalty as her excuse, but Deeside, carry-
ing only w.f.a., fizzled out like a squib after figuring
in the front line. Apparently, the Traquair breed
has no bulldog characteristics. As for Rathkeale —
backed down to 2 to 1 on the strength of his Rand-
wick attempt to beat Ventura, and because W. H.
Smith was riding—he was never in it.
Whilst the Derby was eventuating, the air was
punctuated with derisive comments on the much-
advertised “determination” of the V.R.C. stewards re
foul riding. The stewards had promised and vowed
on behalf of their clients, the public, that all boys
guilty of loose jockeyship should be severely pun-
ished. As a matter of fact, those invertebrate guar-
dians of turf morality did suspend a boy for alleged
interference with the beaten favorite in the Maiden
Plate. They suspended the offender for—the rest of
the day! But how about the Derby race! It was a
disgraceful proceeding. At the first turn out of the
straight, the crowd noted that Jacamar got an awful
bump. A quarter of a mile later, Cisco was seen to
be unmercifully dealt with. The little fellow, when
running second or third, was knocked nearly off his
legs, and thereafter he seemed, for a while, hope-
lessly beaten. Again he showed prominently, and
(suffered some more knocks. Finally, in coming down
the straight, Cisco was blocked, and jockey Black
had to pull him round one or two of them to get an
opening. And then it was too late, or the luckless
animal was too upset to do himself full justice; for,
though he overhauled Jacamar, who had worked into
the lead, he was beaten a head by Wilari, the only
unbumped one of the lot. A rotten race, run in slow
time (2min. 38£sec.), and won by a rank outsider,
whose owner had not thought it good enough to
leave her in the Melbourne Cup. Bad the Derby
been decently and truly run, Cisco, on this showing,
would have won with a bit in hand. But he was
knocked out of his fair dues—and this in a field of
12 only ! This, of course, doesn’t alter the fact that
Wilari deserves credit for finishing in front, after
having longtime figured at the extreme rear. The
filly is by Wallace, and has stamina, but it will
hardly be contended that she won on her merits only.
It was her luck to be lying last whilst the two fav-
orites were getting into trouble.
As in the Derby, so in the Melbourne Stakes.
Black, profiting by his sad experiences with Cisco,
rode a waiting race on Trafalgar, and brought the
grand old battler into position by degrees. Two fur-
longs from home, Trafalgar had only Beverage to
beat. He beat the one-eyed horse in much the same
style as Comedy King had done at Caulfield, in the
Eclipse Stakes," a fortnight earlier. On paper, this
was a good thing for Trafalgar, w’ith Comedy King
and Lady Medallist out of the way—and they were
quite out of the way when the final struggle began.
Though he was said to start at 15 to 1, a number of
small bets must have been booked at about a third of
those astonishing odds, for Trafalgar has never been
so utterly wanting in dash that he could be consid-
ered a rank outsider in a 10 furlongs w.f.a. go.
It would seem that Lady Medallist has gone off
since her Caulfield Cup victory, but the bad per-
formance of Comedy King in the Stakes was due to
anything save staleness. He looked brighter than
usual before the race, and after it, yet he ran no-
where all the way. People are saying that Comedy
has turned sour. He kicks out viciously when he is
being saddled or rubbed down. His recent attempt
to savage Malt King when they were running neck
and neck is quoted as evidence against him. The
next struggle or two will show, perhaps, whether
Comedy King is still a fairly honest workman, or
has turned rogue like Alawa, Emir and many an-
other big performer before him. McLachlan, who
rode the English horse at Randwick recently, attri-
buted his want of go to want of condition, reckoning
that he carried fat inside him. But the trainer and
chief barracker (who is owner Sol Green) seemed to
think Comedy King should have done much better at
Randwick, so it may be that his temper was the
matter with him. Anyhow, it is time the public
began to regard him as a bad animal to lay odds on.
Once in a way the Melbourne Stakes gives the pub-
lic an awful surprise, as when Peru (at 15 to 1)
beat Mooltan (7 to 2 on) three years ago. Last year
Son of the Marsh won, with odds of 12 to 1 against
him. The market price was false, seeing that Son of
the Marsh was notoriously a top-notcher over 10 fur-
longs. But pretty often the favorite wins, and al-
ways it is a good Cup test for the really honest
champions. Look at Trafalgar’s record ! In 1909 he
ran second to Alawa (the favorite) in the Stakes,
and they finished second and fourth respectively for
the Cup, with only two or three yards between them.
Last year Trafalgar came third for the Stakes, a lot
itt front of Comedy King, who (with the best of the
weights) just pipped him for the Cup. This year
Trafalgar won the Stakes, and why he was quoted at
an outside price, the god of gambling only knows.
In three years he has filled each of the places. It is
an honorable record !

“L.S.D.”: Wilari teas an outsider. At
Stawell (Vic.) six men drew a Derby sweep amongst
themselves, deciding to take two (2) horses each, but
found that six into 13 wouldn’t go evenly. So they
agreed, after some argument, to discard one hopeless
prad, and draw the remaining 12. As all resolved that
Wilari was the biggest rotter of the lot, they left her
out . Now the man who drew Cisco wants to know
whether he is first or second.
During the discussion on the Totalisator
Bill in the N.S.W. Assembly, the other evening,
Harry Levien, its sponsor, gave members the inside
running in regard to the revenue received by the
racing clubs in the Sydney metropolitan area from
Dugald Noses. He figured it that the total paid in
bookmakers’ licenses reaches £50,000 a year. Taking
into account all the other expenses connected with
the game or massacre, payments to clerks, and so on,
Harry reckoned that the “mugs” had to weigh out
£200,000 per annum before Jericho begins to make
the profits. And yet Jericho makes heaps of profits.
“Bill Rock” from London: Although the
fight advertised for Earl’s Court has been stopped,
Massa Johnson continues his training operations in
the Gay City across the Silver Streak. In an ex-
pensive villa situated in the heart of one of the most
fashionable quarters of Paris the King of Darktown
reigns supreme, enthroned by the side of his white
wife, and surrounded by a court of white satellites.
These hangers-on depend for their jobs on the skill
and subtlety with which they pander to the dusky
nabob’s love of flattery. Mistah Johnsing out-parvs
the craziest parvenu that ever stepped from the shores
of U.S.A. He is throwing his easily-won dollars to
the four winds with his strong right arm, appar-
ently counting on his dirty left to recoup the ex-
chequer. He has indulged his eccentric craze for
“buzz-carts” to the limit. Two of these expensive
toys are stabled at his Parisian villa, while three
brand-new machines await his arrival in Fogland.
Living in a glorified atmosphere of self-boost, and
buoyed by a false sense of his own importance, the
freak-fighter at first refused to train for his match
with Wells. Herein one foresees his undoing. When
the Inky One eventually loses the championship, he
will be defeated by his own lazy, crazy self. His
backers were at their wits’ end to make him work.
In desperation, they took his wife into their confi-
dence. She did what a dozen men failed to accom-
plish. With some of the Discolored One’s easy earn-
ings, she purchased a dozen French game fowls of
hefty breed, and turned them loose in a large run.
Then, with one of her sweetest smiles, she promised
to pluck and cook all that Lil’ Arthur caught. It
took his Majesty three quarters of an hour to run
down the first pullet, and the rest pro rata. By
the time he handed in the 12th “cheekun,” he had
lost several pounds of superfluous flesh.
Part of Johnson’s weight-reducing curriculum
now consists of a sprint down one of the boule-
vards in the early morning, and a motor ride in the
forenoon. But the serious side of his training—if
there be anything serious about this dusky buffoon—
is done at one of the athletic clubs in the city. And
the order of proceedings is interesting to a degree.
When the precocious pug goes to fhe club, the whole
of his staff, from the Grand Master Masseur to the
Caretaker of the Diamond Collar Stud, accompanies
him. The King of Spades seats his august being.
Valet No. 1 steps forward, removes his diamond
scarfpin and studs, gold watch and chain, loose coin
and sundry items of jewellery. Vassal No. 2 relieves
his Darkness of some other trifles. Serf No. 3 strips
him of his outer garments. And so the game is
played until the Champ. Nig. is revealed resplendent
in broad grin and pink silk underwear. A few min-
utes sparring and ball-punching, followed by massage,
complete the afternoon work; and the robing per-
formance is repeated in inverse ratio. As the mail
closes, comes the announcement that Johnson has de-
cided to retire. This is pure piffle. At the rate he
lives he cannot afford to. His present music-hall en-
gagements will not last very long, and there will be
no high-priced market for a retired pugilist. Give
him his dues, Johnson fills a unique niche in the
scheme of things. He really holds two champion-
ships. Not only is he at the top of the fistic field,
but he may also claim to be the star comic-relief in
this world’s dreary drama.
There wasn’t very much for a referee to
come and go on last Saturday at the Stadium (Syd-
ney), when Kid McCoy, of Melbourne, banged through
20 rounds with Jack Read, an ex-amateur ; but what
there was decided Snowy Baker to plump for McCoy.
Both boys weighed under 9st. 91b.; Read was the
stronger; McCoy was slightly the cleverer. The
latter, also, was more pertinacious, and gradually
wore his opponent down, until about the 12th round
Read seemed likely to be a candidate for removal at
any minute. In the 15th spell of hostilities, how-
ever, he began to recover his strength, and finished
fairly vigorous. A considerable part of the evening
was devoted to wrestling exercises, interspersed with
brief platefuls of biff, until Baker threatened to
stop the performance. McCoy was the worst offender,
and was warned four times for holding with one
hand and making progress with the other. Snowy’s
patience suggested that he had laid a fiver on Wilari
that day.
It took Hugkie Mehegan 18 very lively
rounds at the Sydney Stadium, last week, to convince
Frank Piccato that the Australian lightweight cham-
pionship was in the right stable. In fact, at times,
it looked as though Piccato’s contention that it
wasn’t would be fully borne out. If Piccato had
possessed a somewhat harder punch, and Mehegan a
somewhat softer head, history would have told an-
other tale. Mehegan’s smother only guards the lower
portion of his frank, open countenance, and leaves
the top of his head and his neck waiting tp be
bashed. And the Yankee-Italian did bash it, but not
hard enough. Early in the riot, the American Dago
suspended operations on the champion’s jaw, and
opened fire alternately at the top of his head and
the bottom of his midriff, and the latter proved to
be Mehegan’s soft spot. It shook him up, so that his
left got franctically busy in defence, and Piccato’s
nose got in the way with wearying frequency. In the
14th, Mehegan got in his telling wallop on the jaw,
and repeated it in the 17th. In the 18th,
Piccato was wondering where a solid body
punch had come from, and his jaw wandered
about, grazing in the paddock of circumstances,
and forgot where it was. But Mehegan remembered,
and the timekeeper did the rest. This is Mehegan’s
Second bout with Piccato, and he won the first, on
points, after 20 rounds. This last disturbance
should just about convince Mehegan that the time is
ripe for the abandonment of nine-tenths of his idi-
otic smother. If he doesn’t heave it overboard, he
will some day strike a man with a fist like an axe—
and he won’t get a chance to think about details.
The news from the Slapintosh Stadium is
that Langford is on the Zealandia, and should arrive
in Sydney about the first week of December. lie had
to travel from ’Frisco to Vancouver to catch the
boat, and arrived there in time to find it had started
for Victoria, British Columbia, and he had no chance
of overtaking it. So he hired a tug, and started out
to intercept the steamer somewhere on its way to
Australia. He succeeded in doing it at Cape Flat-
tery, a wild bit of American coast, and after a des-
perate struggle was hauled on board by a sling and
tackle, like a bundle of any old goods. If it is
true that Johnson has retired, which this paper does
not believe, the scrap between Langford and McVea
will be for the championship of the world; but
whether for the championship of the world or not,
it will be an attractive scrap. We have seen a lot
of white men battered by niggers of late, and it
will be a pleasant change to see two niggers knock-
ing seven devils out of one another. There are whis-
pers that the Melnstoush will extend his operations
north and south. It is known that McVea, Clabby,
and other shining lights will make a descent on Bris-
bane with a view to missionary work in that capital;
but it is merely whispered that a Stadium will be
shortly erected in Melbourne, and the Victorian
capital treated to a weekly scrap. The English XI
happens to have otte bruiser in its complement, and
the fact moved Mclntosh to make the whole XI
honorary members of the Stadium during their stay
in the Country. The benefit for the children
of the victims of the Thirroul surfing disaster
panned out somwhere between £4OO and £5OO.
Over £l2O is already in hand for the Rosedale and
Macleay fund, although the benefits at the Stadium
and the Palace Theatre have still to eventuate. In
December there will be another huge upheaval in aid
of Sydney Hospital, at which Miss Nellie Stewart’s
valuable assistance will be forthcoming, and it is
more than possible that the widely respected and
admired “Snowy” Baker will “put ’em on” with
Harold Hardwicke. Which should be very pretty to
watch.
* * * *
The fight this Saturday night at Sydney
Stadium is expected to be something right out of the
ordinary, and worth going far to see. Dave Smith
is said to be in better fettle than ever before, and to
have improved vastly as the result of the battles he
has been through. In short, he is said to have be-
come a finished fighter. Bandsman Rice recently
showed Sydney a taste of his quality when he played
with Jack Howard for 11 rounds and then demolished
him because things were growing monotonous. The
young Englishman won’t be able to play that game
with the hefty Smith.
Yankee fighter Papke announces his retire-
ment from the ring. He bumped a snag at Boston,
the home of culture, in the shape of one Moha (what
a name!), and immediately grew disgusted with
fighting. In fact, Papke is in a state of wholesale
disgust, and has taken a dislike to everything. Most
of all he has taken a sudden aversion to training,
which, he says, he now finds to be very hard wprk.
And as he has made enough money, he has decided
to chuck work and “forget all about fighting.” For
a man as unpopular as Papke has become, it is an
eminently sane decision.
Poor old Bob Fitzsimmons is in trouble
again. And, as,, usual, it is Mrs. Fitz. Whenever Bob
does anything to offend her artistic sense, that rather
erratic, though beautiful, lady leaves him for a spell,
and Bob’s heart begins to break. When the lady con-
siders that it is a fair thing, she returns, and all
goes merrily once more. This time the lady has not
exactly left her lord, he is merely suspended, and on
six months’ probation. Robert is getting on in years
now, and six months’ suspension is a rather drastic
punishment for one who has such a little while to
run —a fact which Mrs. Fitz should take into account.
The Commonwealth bantam championship
has changed hands again in the Melbourne Athletic
Club’s pen, where Ted Green succumbed to a Vic-
torian boy. The new-comer is Charley Simpson, un-
earthed and educated by Jack McGowan, who, having
ceased beating champions, is now engaged in making
them. This was practically Simpson’s first public
appearance, but he swarmed all over the champion
in the first five rounds. Seeing great trouble coming
his way if he could not arrange an early finish,
Green waded in after that; but the new boy despised
the assault, and played back a better game. He was
faster, cleaner and stronger than Green, and won all
the way, getting a decision on points.
The Queensland cricket team was no
match for the one that the Ma State hurled against
it at Sydney Cricket Ground. The N.S.W. batting
was very solid indeed. Macartney piled up 122, and
four stalwarts backed him up with scores of over 50.
Only three members of the team failed to reach
double figures, even good old Sundries making 21.
When Queensland went to the sticks it was depressed
by the sight of a mountainous score of 498. And
while it was still depressed at the sight of the heap
it had to climb over, Folkard and Emery fell on it,
and got it down, Folkard taking three wickets for
28 runs and Emery three for 48 —more than half the
team for 76. Fennelly stood up to it and swung a
clubbed bat in a desperate stand, smashing up 71.
But it was a hopeless fight, and his side vanished for
162. So the Queenslanders followed on with a deficit
of 336 on the first innings. At the end of Satur-
day’s play the North had accumulated 86 in the
second innings without losing a wicket, and was
plodding courageously. On Monday it continued to
plod. Jennings played a perfect innings for 123, and
Fennelly made another splendid stand, hitting up
78. But wickets fell around them, and the last hope
petered out when business closed for 280. N.S.W.
was on top with an innings and 56 runs to spare.
The opening of the fourth round of Syd-
ney First Grade cricket was marked; by the return to
power of the bat. The two previous Saturdays had
seen the leather on top, but on Saturday the pendu-
lum swung back, and Willow was king once more.
M. A. Noble threw together 120 in 152 min. for Pad-
dington against North Sydney. Diamohd accumu-
lated 100 in 140 min. for Burwood against Central
Cumberland. J. B. Lane carried his bat for 95,
made in 103 min., for University, against Petersham.
F. A. Iredale notched 84 in 120 min. for Gordon
against Sydney. The only successful bowler of the
day was J. Randall, of Middle Harbor, who blew out
five Balmain wickets for 49 runs. The next best were
the three for 66 by R. J. Law, of Petersham, against
University, and four for 92 by H. V. Hordern for
North Sydney against Paddington. A negative sort
of interest hung round the match between Gordon
and Sydney, for neither team had won a match
since the season began, and they could hardly be so.
bad as to both lose. It looks as though Gordon.will,
break its egg this time, for it piled up 351, in spite
of the absence of Trumper and Macartney, and chiefiy
through the good work of three colts. University did
deadly deeds on Petersham, and ran up 398 for the
afternoon. Balmain seems to be in a tight place
against Middle Harbor, as the Tattered Suburb made
only 113 at the first attempt, and Middle Harbor
promptly responded with 130 for the loss of six
wickets. Waverley achieved 300, and then got three
Redfern wickets for 88 runs. Paddington, up against
North Sydney, has, thanks to M. A. Noble, 290 rutis
for the loss of eight wickets. But the dandy score of
the day was the 388 put up by Burwood against Cen-
tral Cumberland for the loss of eight wickets. Cen-
tral Cumberland’s chances look blue.

The English cricketers arrived in Adelaide
on Saturday morning, and commenced practice that
afternoon, after having imbibed the cup of welcome.
The cup of welcome iB not a good thing to practise
on, but, apparently, they were anxious to get rid of
their sea legs, and waded in with commendable
promptitude, Warner is accompanied by his wife
and two children, so what with looking after them,
running his team, and keeping up his end as a talker,
the captain is in for a busy time. Of course, it is
quite possible that the wife and two children will
look after the old man, and soothe his troubled brow
when the bowling goes wrong and the batting starts
to rot. Things are not always what they seem.

Maoriland is importing English cricket
“coaches” once more, Hawkes Bay acquiring “Jack”
Board, and Auckland taking unto itself G. J. Thomp-
son, This business has been going on for a long
wtiile now, and yet, somehow, Maoriland’s cricket
progress is that of an overballasted snail.
Melbourne Cricket Club is a good concern
to hold a member’s ticket in, but its ground is a
horrible place to try to get gate-money at. Last
year no less than 5440 members paid £10,106 ss.
for the right to walk into everything held on the
ground, without further charge. This multiplicity of
deadheads makes the ground unpopular with people
who promote amusements.
J. Gorman’s record for the 70 miles be-
tween Ballarat and Melbourne was not allowed to
stand long. Hardly was the ink dry in the record
book when the figures were charged by E. Tyler,
mounted on a 3|-h.p. Triumph, Dunlop-Shod, aild
completely wrecked by a fine ride, which averaged
374 miles an hour for the distance. Tyler did his
break in the early morning when the roads were clear
of traffic.

The swimmers of Sydney Were out ill
force on Saturday, but did not have too good a day.
The sun was warm enough, but the wind bit like the
tooth of a Presbyterian Serpent. Most of the events
were confined to the amateur clubs, The only big
deed of the day Was the Rose Bay Hundred, Long-
worth and Alec Wickham were there, but Were over-
whelmed by the long starters, although Alep Wick-
ham did manage to dash into second place in his
heat. Sherwood, who had a good chance for the
final, anticipated the starter, and was fired out, So
the decision went to Moxon, who had been conceded
20sec. Swimming is evidently going to boom this
summer, when a club like that of Manly haß 66
starters for one event. Owing to lack of data to
work on, the handicappers were all at sea, and from
Manly to far Bondi, it was a day of joy for the long-
starters.

Human, the Canadian sculler, has been
making remarks about the possibility of meeting
Arnst, and says he is hopeful that a match may be
fixed up for Toronto Bay next summer. He says
that Arnst cabled him asking for an offer, that he
tendered twice as large a sum for expenses as he re-
ceived when he went to Australia, that the tender
was refused, and that it is now “up to” the cham-
pion to state exactly what he wants. And it is “up
to” Richard, sure enough.

The average sporting journalist is more or
less of a dreary personage, and papers and maga-
zines devoted to any particular pastime are usually
•distinguished by their stodginess. But the latest
arrival, the Anchor, is somewhat of an exception to
the rule. This is a new paper issued by the Aquatic
Press of Sydney, and aims at covering the whole of
the yachting and motor boating of Australia and
Maoriland. It is a big order, but for three numbers
the 66-page magazine has filled the order and filled
it well.

The downfall of Holway, the Yankee
runner, was very complete at Newcastle on Saturday.
“Major” Taylor, of Victoria, tackled him, and in the
76yds. overthrew him, with a half-yard to spare,
in 7 1-5 sec.; and also in the 100yds., which the
Australian is credited with having run in
9 2-ssec. If the clocking is right, it was an amazing
run, and beat the best ever done by Duffy, the
Yankee_flier whose amateur status blew up so sud-
denly. When Holway heard the time he just pushed
himself into his clothes and remarked that it was
not worth while bothering about the 125yds. Which
was a reasonable conclusion. The time is probably
right, as something like a hurricane was blowing,
and it hit the runners in the back. A side line
of the meeting was the defeat of Miss Moore by
Miss V. Meredith in the Ladies’ Sprint Championship.

Professional footracing is reviving in Syd-
ney and the parts adjacent thereto. At the Marrick-
ville 100yds. Handicap no less than 2000 people rolled
up to see 75 peds toil and sweat. It was the biggest
gathering since the palmy days of Carrington and
Botany, and the rush to the tape was close enough
to make the most stolid observer feel thrills. The
final went to W. G. Wright, with C. Grant and >.
Ward in the other -laces. The chief danger to the
sport is that it may boom, for when foot-racing
booms, it inevitably bursts.
STOMACH WORMS.
A MENACE TO CHILDREN.
Stomach Worms are undoubtedly the most
invidious kind of all. They inhabit the
stomach, and inflict great havoc upon their
victim. They deprive the victim of half the
nutriment he consumes, and when the stom-
ach is empty, gnaw the sides of the stomach,
causing such terrible sensations as to often
cause faintness. Aperient medicines have
no effect upon them, for when any purgative
is taken they fasten themselves to the walls
of the stomach by a groove running down
their side. The only method of dislodging
Stomach Worms is to starve the system and
take Comstock's “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets.
The worms are weakened by the want ot
food, and are induced to take whatever is
taken into the stomach. Comstock's "Dead
Shot” Worm Pellets contain the properties
which sicken and disable the worms, and a
dose of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills will
clear them out of the system. The wife ot
a well-known Waitara, N.Z., storekeeper,
writes: —“Last week we received the packet
of Comstock’s ‘Dead Shot' Worm Pellets,
and I am glad to say that they have proved
wonderfully effective. My little bov aged •>,
for whom we procured the pellets after one
dose expelled a stomach worm measuring
10i inches in length.”
Comstock’s “Dead Shot Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable preparation for the
eradication of worms in children and adults.

The dreadful Gold Coast of Africa did the
Commonwealth another bad turn lately, when
it killed D. W. S. McArthur, a brilliant
youngster, who knew more about tin than
anybody else of his age in Australia. The
son of an ex-railway guard in S. Aus., he
won a raft of scholarships, which floated
him through the Adelaide Uni. and the
School of Mines. Then, having specialised
in tin, he managed mines and works for
John Moffat and his cos. in N. Queensland,
and, at 27, left to take a post-graduate
course in the U.S.A. But he turned aside, to
give a hand with the Gold Coast mining
nrcblem —and that was the end, at 29.
“Bails” writes, apropos of nothing: —
Cricketers Caffyn and Lawrence are the only sur-
vivors of the first English team that visited Aus-
tralia, in 1861. Caffyn is in Iteigate (Eng.), and
Lawrence in Melbourne. Caffyn had been to Canada
with the first eleven that left England, in 1859. It
included Stephenson, captain of the team for Aus-
tralia in 1861, and Parr, captain of the one that
arrived in 1863, when E. M. Grace was a member. In
spite of these successes, there was no more English
team till W. G. Grace brought one 10 years after.
Caffyn, who was in the 1863 team as well as that of
1861, took a three years’ engagement as professional
with the Melbourne Cricket Club; but they let him
off at the end of a year, and he established a profit-
able hairdressing business in Sydney. None of his
four sons showed any taste for cricket.

THE business man finds recreation and respite
from the worries of the day in billiards. There
friends meet and together enjoy the game that
calls forth concentration, skill and judgment.
On an ALCOCK table the balls run perfectly,
the angles are accurate and the cushions play beauti-
fully, adding materially to the enjoyment of the game.
In the hotel; in the club; in the home —
wherever men largely congregate, there an Alcock
Billiard Table is usually found.
These are the same tables on which George
Gray and Fred Lindrum, jun., have become famous
for their record breaks.
The “ Bijou ” is a favorite home billiard table,
fitted with fast running cushions, superfine billiard
cloth, and faultlessly finished.

ANTI N EURASTHIN
I S the only possible means of remedying nervous
* breakdown and nerve weakness.
Drugs in the form of medicines and tonics usually
containing strychnine and iron, though sometimes
giving temporary relief, must leave the patient in a
worse condition than before.
Antineurasthin contains neither drug nor chemical,
but cures by feeding the nerve and brain cells with
their natural food element, Lecithin, in an active
organic and highly assimilable form. It is the only
means known to science of doing this.
Sufferers are cautioned against vendors who at-
tempt to substitute crude inorganic Lecithin, in the
form of pills or medicine, as a substitute for Anti-
neurasthin. These cannot be assimilated, and have
no value as a nerve food.
Antineurasthin is prepared in tablet form, pleasant
to the taste, and convenient to carry, if travelling.

Hannibal: We want interesting pars.;
but don’t send us a smother of vague words put
them through the concentrating mill before you send
them. Cut out paragraphs that appear, and send
with date and page to accountant. . .N.A.A.: Can’t
publish on an ex-patient’s say-so; still you ought to
give the local Chief Sec. a chance to look into the
matter.. .J.C.: The statement means exactly what
it says. When matter has been accepted and pub-
lished by The Bulletin, the author can republish it
elsewhere, provided it is mentioned that it originally
appeared in The Bulletin. . .K.N.: Dream stories
are mostly poor. Yours is no exception to the rule.
...Camden: Eminently hopeless.. .C.E.R.: A mas-
terpiece of incapacity. In fact, you are the Carbine
of complete dreariness, and it is hardly worth while
for the other horses to start... J.R.: The story of
Mick and Paddy and the horse contains nothing new.
Only the same old swindle, delusion, lie, fraud and
steal.. .P.J.W.: The proposition about the weariness
of Heaven has been done many times and oft. ..
F.L.8.: Young’s “Tour in Ireland, Wakefield s lhe
Statistical and Political Account of Ireland,’ Burkes
“Letters, Speeches and Tracts on Ireland are works
that you should find in Sydney Public Library.. .
Yarwon: Hardly interest enough; but put people and
incidents into brief pars., and you’ll very likely get
there...B.C.D.: No. The hysterical lady who hates
her husband because his boots squeak, and who yearns
to throw things about, and quote poetry, and have
the right man rumpling her hair in some place
where there are less than five kittens to trip over,
and no corned beef to cook —that lady has been done
to death. ...T.11.T. (Q.) : Letter arrived, but you don t
give the title of the verses or the writer s name.

THE INNKEEPER’S CURSE.
Attracted by the brilliant glare
Of a clear and welcome light
A traveller entered a roadside inn
One wild and stormy night
Upon the traveller’s bag of gold
The innkeeper’s eyes did gloat
He grimly drugged the illfated man
And slashed a knife across his throat
There was a feeble stirring of the victim s frame
The cruel tragedy was o’er
The assassin grasped the glittering gold
Alas, the rover was no more.
With the aid of his diabolical wife
The human monster hid his crime
Within the shadow of the lonely inn
They consigned the body to quicklime.

How the lawyer “rides” the non-legal hono-
arium! At Port Pirie (S.A.) a deserter
from a British ship pleaded guilty, and the
usual “shipowners’ sentence” was asked for
—l4 days or till the ship is ready to sail.
Now, S.A. has passed an Act which does not
allow imprisonment of deserters, and one
J.P. knew enough law for that. The other
took the word of the ship’s counsel, that
“where Imperial and ‘colonial’ statutes dis-
agree, the former always overrides the lat-
ter” ; also, 6s. Bd. told them what the
Supreme Court would say to them if he took
along an appeal in which they, as “mere
laymen,” had decided a point of law against
him “after having been told they were in
the wrong.” However, the first J.P. wouldn’t
budge, so a third J.P. had to be sent for, to
give a majority verdict for gaol. Possibly
the legal man was right, on the technical
ground that this ship is registered in Lon-
don, not in Australia. But, if country
magistrates have to accept any counsel’s
ruling as absolute and final, what hope is
there for a suitor who happens to be too
poor to engage Mr. Horsehair?
From Sydney Evening News :
Deceased was in comfortable circumstances, and
was a big landholder in the Freshwater district,
owning about half the land in the vicinity. He had,
however, never expressed any intention of commit-
ting suicide.
Another instance of the eccentricity of the
affluent.
It is reported, to the utter staggerment of
the Tory party, that the new Labor Ministr\
in Westralia proposes to begin its career of
economy by cutting down its own salaries.
Premier George Turner did that in the baa
days of Victoria, but it isn’t a wildly usual
sort of thing.

A German Opinion of BEALE PIANOS
“ M usical Opinion and Music t rade Review,” London, July, 1911, says:
“A Hamburg trade journalist, who has just returned from the Antipodes, states that the pianos
“manufactured by the Beale Company in Sydney greatly resemble in touch and in tone those turned
“out at the best German factories. The Beale is sold at forty-five pounds and upwards, and enjoys
“a good reputation not only in Australia but in India, Java, South Sea Islands and other colonial
“countries with hot climates. The ‘Hamburger’ fears that if these British colonials extend their piano
“manufacturing operations there will be little room left for continental makers in the musical
“instrument line.”

Made Sleep Impossible Tried Cuti-
cura Ointment and in Incredibly
Short Time Cure Was Complete,
“About twelve months ago while residing
at Newry, Gippsland, I was very much
troubled with my feet. They were highly
inflamed and on raising the foot off the
ground it seemed as though someone were
searing the soles with a red-hot iron. There
was a constant itching which was very trying,
particularly at nights as it made sleep im-
possible, I tried all the largely advertised
remedies, such as ointments, soaps, etc.,
but all these acted only as so much water
might have done.
“I was advised to try Cuticura Ointment
which I did and am pleased to say that in
an incredible short space of time the inflam-
mation had disappeared and the cure was so
complete that I afterwards engaged in foot-
ball, an idea which in my former condition
was the height of absurdity. I have also
used the Cuticura Ointment for boils and
find that it is highly satisfactory and best
of all. completely eliminates the usual dis.
figuring marks. I have also used Cuticura
Soap and would not think of washing with
the old adulterated, impure rubbish which is
wrongly called soap. I wish you would pub-
lish this letter so that other sufferers may
benefit by my experience ” (Signed) Gus
Forde Long, 282 Dorcas St. So. Melbourne,
Vic., Mar. 26, 1911.
Skin-sufferers! Do you realize that to go
through life tortured and disfigured by itch-
ing, burning, scaly and crusted eczemas, or
other skin and scalp humours is unnecessary?
For more than a generation, warm baths

of Cuticura Ointment have proved successful
in the most distressing cases, of
children and adults, when all else had failed.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold through-

If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“ half ” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

From Bathurst (N.S.W.) : “Bathurstian” erred
in one particular concerning the late James Ruther-
ford’s attitude towards the National Advocate of
late years. He did not resign his directorship nor
yet his chairmanship of that journal, by way of pro-
test against its Labor proclivities. All he did was
to withdraw his name as printer and publisher
from the foot of the Lost Sheet. Between the time
the Advocate declared for Labor and Rutherford’s
decease, he called about 2000 special meetings, with
a view to influencing the other directors to do the
Reid-Smith aet, but without any Anti-Sosh result.
By the way, as lately as eight years ago, Rutherford
was pretty well “broke” ; yet he died a millionaire.
He told the writer that when he was purchasing
land in N.S.W. he was always involved, but directly
he commenced leasing land in Queensland he started
to accumulate. Something of an advt. for Nielsen’s
policy, methinks.
Gone to press for the last time, a few days ago,
James Alexander Matthews, printer of the Otago
Daily Times. Fifty-seven years ago Matthews was
apprenticed to the Witness, which is now the weekly
edition of the Times, and remained on the paper until
’6l, when the gold rushes Were surging. Thenabouts,
he bought a partnership in the first paper established
in the Waikouaiti district; and, in 1867, purchased
the Tuapeka Press. George Fenwick, now managing
director and. ex-editor of'the O. D. Times, subse-
quently became Matthews’s partner in the Press, and
after working the paper up and selling it, the pair
founded the GromweLl Argus. Fenwick left the
goldfields and went to Dunedin, where he became in-
terested in the Times, and engaged his former
partner as head reader. A quarter of a century back
Matthews was appointed printer to the paper, and
remained at the fly-wheel until Death called round
for him. If he had lived another year he would have
been aged 80.

From an Adelaide pressman: That misprint of
the Herald (noted in B. 28/9/’ll), by which the
attention of “fiends” was invited to a burial-notice,
has caused a holy horror of the word among
Adelaide comps. You can’t get it into print now!
Twice lately I have written it, and found in the
proof the extra R inserted. The second time, the
comp, proposed to inform the public that a magician
had called up “Lucifer, Beelzebub and other friends.”
* * .* •
A ..writer in a late number of ’the Academy resur-
rects the original reporter. He was one Samuel
Peeke, who, when the English Star Chamber was
abolished, got authority to print the speeches made
in the House of'Commons. He seems to have had a
good opinion of that body, for he called his first
issue “Speeches and Passages of this Great and
Happy Parliament, from the 3rd of June to this in-
stant, June, 1641.” This Was really the first Han-
sard, issued hundreds of years before the Hansards
were born. Later, Peeke published “The Diurnal
Occurrences or Dayly Proceedings of this Great and
Happy Parlt.,” and then competitors arose. The
whole of the crowd was suppressed by Cromwell,
who wanted all the news for his bi-weekly official
rag, for Cromwell was also on the Inky Way.
When the last English mail left, the National
Union of Journalists, was conducting a reporters’
strike at York against the ruling conditions, par-
ticularly the hours of labor, which run from 15 to 16
every day of the week. The somewhat peculiar thing
is. that the union was able to get its picketing advts.
inserted in various papers, as follows:
“Newspaper reporters are requested to communi-
cate. with the Hon. Secretary of the National Union
of Journalists, Press Club, Victoria Street, Manches-
ter, before applying for situations at York.”
The National Union was established about four years
ago to combat the unlovely sweating of pressmen in
Merrie England, where it is estimated that 60 per
cent, of working journalists receive below £2 per
week, and probably, about 30 per cent, no more than
I£l 10s. a week. Instances have been reported to
the Union: where trained and efficient reporters,
married men with children, are getting anything
between £1 and I‘l 10s. a week. The case of one
reporter was specially brought into notice. He was
paid so scandalously that his wife was forced to go
out to work in order that he and the family could
keep up that “respectability which a gentleman of
the presk is .expected to maintain.’.’ The N.U.J.,
which is registered as a trades union, has done some
useful work during its short existence, and is at
present busying itself collecting all the shocking in-
formation ,it can against that section of the em-
ployers which retains the best traditions of sweating
under good old Freetrade.
H. P. G'olebatch, who ran T. H. Bath, the former
leader of the Westralian Labor party, for the Avon
seat, and finished second, was the leader of the insur-
rection that broke out some years ago against the
pig-sty conditions under which pressmen worked in
Perth Parliament House. It was a warm rebellion
while it lasted, and Colebatch was warned off the
sacred but insanitary premises. After a while he
took over a country paper, and when not instructing
the Westralian cocky in the gentle art of cultivating
paddy-melons and other herbage, has been chasing a
seat in Parliament. Like the Hockinars, who struck
oil with the Kalgoorlie journal, Colebatch worked
in the grime of the Broken Hill newspaper offices
before Bigjohn’s Cinderella winked and enticed him
West.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” : Apropos J. P. Fawkner’s
MS. Journal (B. 21/9/’ll), which was Victoria’s
first newspaper. I have a letter written by J. P.
Fawkner, addressed to myself, and dated December
7, 1861 ; and I have a litho facsimile of the MS. Jour-
nal, No. 8, Feb. 19, 1838. Allowing for the lapse of
years, unsteadiness of hand through age, and the
need in the journal to use a round, robust style of
penmanship, I have no doubt, on comparing my two
exhibits, that Fawkner himself wrote the original of
the litho.

“Vulcan”; It mav interest N. Lindsay to know
that he has inspired a sermon. At a Fiji Little
Bethel, recently, the homily was taken from Lind-
say’s picture-poem, “A Trio” (“We walk along the
gas-lit street in a dreadful row, we three; the
woman I was and the woman I am, and the woman
I’ll some day be.”) Then, Ker-is-tian-like, the
snuffler apologised for his source on the ground that
“even roses grow on a dunghill”—just as I apologise
for the source of my par. on the ground that even a
worm may turn up a speck of gold.
THE SINFUL BOOKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Melbourne Anglican Synod attacks “the enormous
output of immoral fiction,” but hesitates to publish
a black list, “partly because such a course would in-
crease the circulation of the objectionable novels.”
The great, wide-spreading Church was built,
And ministers were trained,
To wipe out sin, and punish guilt;
But long has it abstained
From naming, too precisely, sins
At which ’twould hurl its javelins,
Because that sort of holy fuss
Makes Sunday flocks so curious.
The shepherd once could deftly scare
The ewe lambs from a naughty book
With threats of Hell’s atrocious glare,
And fear of the infernal cook.
In that time ignorance was bliss—
llow very different in this!
When told of sin, we may decry it,
But find ourselves disposed to try it!
And so it haps the Church, these days,
In pain and anger must confess
To show the people wicked ways
Is to invite them to transgress.
In bitterness it soon must own
The Devil might be all unknown—
A failure in his province grim—
But for the ads. it’s given him.

IN BANANA LAND
Premier Denham’s new Liquor Bill con-
tains an apti-lambing-down clause, providing
that wayside hotelkeepers may only charge
country workers on their way to the city the
regular tariff and ss. a, day extra for liquor.
It is a desirable provision, though Heaven
only knows Avhy it should be any" less unde-
sirable for the frowsy city pub. to rook Mulga
Jim than for the bush shanty to do it.
Said a Queensland Minister, ominously,
the other day: “If the drought continues, we
mav have to slack off in loan expenditure.”
That’s it in a cocoanut-shell. When there’s
a bountiful harvest, feed the boom by lavish
borrowings. When there’s a drought, feed
the slump by sacking all hands attracted by
the loan works. And in the distance is the
shadow of the flock of curses that are coming
home to roost, drought or no drought—
-34.000,000 of them by July, 3935.
Queensland’s revenue for the four months
just ended was £222,000 greater than for the
corresponding third of the .previous year,
while expenditure was £443,020 greater. So
for every £1 increase in revenue the Denham
Government spent an extra £2. Yet, every
month, Treasurer Barnes assures Queens-
land that “a tignt hand is being kept on tne
expenditure.” Does he, by any chance, mean
a drunken hand?
How the waste of little Australians may
be prevented by judicious legislation can be
judged from the operation of the Queensland
Infant Life Protection Act. In 3907, when
this Act came into force, the percentage of
deaths was 15 •9. In 1910, after it had been
four years working, the rate was down to
7 • 8 per cent., 'and thereby “grandmotherly”
Socialistic legislation gets another fine and
large advt.
“Barcoo”: The bullock and horse team
mode of carriage is doomed in Central
Queensland, and the “motor train” is here
to stay. Qn Rupert Clarke’s Isis Downs
station, on the Barcoo, one of those trains
is being used with great success. The engine
is a six-cylinder, petrol-driven, and develops
65 horse-power. By an ingenious contriv-
ance, in the shape of a geared rod running
through the four trucks composing the train,
the power is equally developed on the driving-
wheel of each truck. The carrying capacity
of the train is 28 tons, and it is at present
pulling wool to the railway, a distance of 60
miles, in 30 hours, at a cost of about 69 per
cent, below ruling carriers' rates.
When We Was Young.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, the “good times that are cornin’,”
They can never, never be
Half as good as those old hummin’
Days of one-time usedterbe,
AVhen the Guv’nor governed reelly,
And a Toff was all a Toff,
And no Press dared curse ’em freely,
Or presoom to take ’em off.
You may talk of cornin’ glories,
When the workers rule the land,
But you’ll never beat the stories
Of our dawnin’s, young and grand ;
Then the man of crime was collared,
And was landed in the clink,
And no agitators hollered,
And the people couldn't think.
In those days remuneration
It were never very high,
For we were a lowly nation,
With a taste for humble pie;
’there was toilin’, moilin’ masses,
Who their places usedter know,
There was genooine upper classes,
As would stoop to nothin’ low.
There was no one then a-battenin’
On the public discontent;
There was just the wealthy fattenin’
On their wool and hides and rent;
Then the best of land was grazin’
Pure Merino’s sheep and hoss.
And the common folk kep’ raisin’
Of their head-gear to the boss.
There was no outrageous papers
In the days when we was young,
And for low seditious capers
You would almost sure be hung;
There was convict gangs and fetters
For the reelly low and bad :
And you bowed before your betters,
And was never thought a cad.
But to-day the mob is jeerin’
At the pillars of the State;
And the Press is alwuz sneerin’
At the Portly and the Great ;
Ev’ry lout’s a politician
Who can wag a flooent tongue—
Oh ! they'd find their right position
In the world when we was young.

PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, November .4, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
The Macgregors have returned to us from
sinful, but not unbeautiful, Rockhampton,
and the Central District, after an enjoy-
able excursion, and that faithful attention
to the opening of bazaars and oysters which
is expected from members of the Australian
Governors’ Union. They brought back sev-
eral illustrated addresses, and a good opinion
of most of the people they met. Also, they
left behind them a good impression, so it was
a fair exchange.
On Saturday afternoon, Governor Mac-
gregor and Lady Mac., attended by Captain
Foxton, who is A.D.C.-ing at present, ignored
the call of Ascot, and patronised a “Poppy”
fete, in aid of some flourishing charity. So-
ciety, however, flocked to the racecourse,
and everybody I knew lost even yWis socks,
as tile sports say. The frocking was much
smarter than usual, and, as the weather was
A NATIONAL CALAMITY.
STRANGER : “ What’s the flag at hal-mast fort Is anyone dead?”
DISGUSTED MINING BROKER: “ Yes—business.”
delightfully cool, things might have been
worse.
a . i t> u- a .
V? J^-Sen .-General R-obmsons have been
™ gllled in a f lld social , wlnrlpool. On
Tuesday, several score of dames took advan-
taS? of Premieres Denham s day to pay
thelr respects to Mrs. Agent, and the rite
was solemnised without a hitch On the
same afternoon, miss Phyllis Robinson had
arranged a children’s party, at the Pope
Cooper residence, and, as the Agent-Gen-
eral’s wife was expected there with the
young Agent-Generals, or Agent-Corporals,
| ar g e herds of fond mammas were also bid-
(jen_ Alas, for the desolation of disappoint-
mcmj;! The afore-mentioned “day” pre-
vented Mrs. General from attending the
so i r g e until the kknock-off” bell rang. How-
ever the small folk had a good time. Their
troubles !
Mr. and Mrs. Robinson harnessed themselves
in full armor—in Mrs. Robinson’s case, a
creation of oyster-grey satin and beaten sil-
ver—and dined a select few at the Gardens
Kiosk on Tuesday evening. Besides A.-Gen-
eral Robinson and his wife, the guests in-
cluded the Ross Munros, who had arrived
the day before, by Orient boat, from frost-
bitten England, where foxes, Freetrade,
starvation and other amusements are all the
go.
The National Council of Women also con-
sider it their bounden duty to extend the
welcoming mitt to the Robinsons, and have
issued invitations, for that purpose, for Sat-
day. Premier Denham has chartered the
Lucinda for Monday, with the same object
in view. In fact, just now the air is full
of Robinson.
Miss Margaret Tully, a daughter of the
; squatting Tully family, hath trodden the con-
fetti-strewn path that leadetli to matrimony,
which the Frenchman recommended as the
one indiscretion which could not be com-
mitted daily. Mr. O’Gorman, of Coorparoo.
shares the presents and his wages with the
lady. The congratulatory champagne and
bedecked tvedding cake were features of the
family gathering, and later, the O’Gormans
escaped towards Sydney and those Blue
Mountains Avhich are no bluer (ban most
other mountains.
W. J. Scott, who has, at the second time
of asking, accepted a seat on the Land Court
bench, has been dealing in red tape for
something like 40 years, for the last 10 of
them as Under-Secretary. In addition to
being the possessor of an 1.5.0., his know-
ledge of land values, and the carrying capac-
ity of land, has made him a terror to the
speculative pastoralist who overstocks. P.
W. Shannon, his assistant, steps into the
vacated Under-Secretaryship.
Although, during November and the sub-
sequent summer months, indoor festivals are
regarded with , a bored feeling of indiffer-
ence, very' few hostesses have grasped the
fact that our climate is ideal for outdoor en-
tertainment. It remained for Bowling Club
President liollingshed, and Mrs. President,
to demonstrate, on Thursday evening, how
much more pleasant it is to play at cards in
a brilliantly-lighted open space, or to roam
round the courts, to a musical accompani-
ment, than it is to lead the faded life within
four walls. Miss Nellie Nicholson and Mr.
Eadie saw to it that the music was up to the
excellent brand of cigars provided, and who-
ever provided the supper was no slouch
either.
Mrs. Eddington departs this month for
Melbourne, anti tea and bridge pursue her by
day and night. Mesdames J. K. Stewart,
R. J. McNab and Eagan have led the fare-
well attack.
Those people who had already closed on
their Tatt.’s tickets are sympathising with
the unfortunates whose guileless requests are
being handed back to them by a too-paternal
Government. There appears to be no harm
in a gamble for inferior cushions and ex-
cruciating oil-paintings, at a church bazaar,
or even in a whirl of the little cardboard
wheel; but, according to the Wowser, Tatt.’s
is the free pass to that burn from which no
traveller returns. And what the Wowser
says seems likely to go with the Federal
party, which has control over the matter.
Miss Tempe Pigott. a popular Society
girl of Brisbane, whom you, my dear, will
remember as Christine Grant in “Nobody’s
Daughter,” arrives home on Monday. Tempe
is wearing her laurels at a most becoming
angle, and we, who sent her enthusiastic
rosebuds, tied with creased hair-ribbon, in
the days of her amateur efforts, are now-
preparing to make the florist get real busy.
The majority of marriages solemnised in
the Anglican sheepfold are tied by Canon
.Tones. “You see, my dear, Canon Jones
married father and mother,” and (lint
ends the argument. “Tommy,” as he
is affectionately and irreverently called, has
been at the shepherding business for 50 odd
years, and, to mark their appreciation of
bis work, hundreds of those whom he has
christened, married or propelled along the
narrow way. gathered together this week
and handed him a purse with much sordid
gain inside. If it had been twice as much,
he would have deserved 30. times more.
Yours affectionately.
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Died, the other day, aged 82, ,T. D. Keith,
who was editor of the Wide Bay and
Burnett News for about 30 years. His
father came out in the early ’so’s, to manage
the Moreton Bay COURIER, now the Bris-
bane Courier, but died, from cholera, as the
vessel was discharging its passengers.
“Quadrille” : The kangaroo is a rare bird
even in the bush these times, but, in Barcal-
dine, the other morning, right opposite the
shire hall, I surprised two of them browsing
on an advertising hoarding. Whether they
did it to annoy the billposters, or to show
their disapproval of mcture fakes. I don’t
know; but I guess it; was drought that drove
them into the township in the first place.
“The Prodigal”: Remarkable cures of
rheumatism are being repented from the
Muckadilla bore, near Roma (Q.), where
the Government has at last agreed to erect
baths. And the reports are not exagger-
ated. They are simply guaranteed by au-
thentic cases, and the wonder is that Mucka-
dilla hasn’t now a large concourse of the
rheumatic-ridden absorbing health from its
waters. Another equally curative bore is
Barcaldine, in Central Queensland, and if
the Government would only advertise these
places as they should be, a considerable num-
ber of Bananaland’s afiiicted citizens, who
journey yearly to the Maoriland springs,
could be cured at home without inconveni-
ence and at half the expense.
When you have a bad taste in the mouth take a
dose of Chamberlain’s Tablets.*

Do not Wait for
the Travelling
Thresher Gang
Don't miss the market with your wheat.
Don't have to do your wheat carting when the roads are bad.
Don't pay away a big chunk of your year's profits in fancy prices
for threshers.
You don't have to do any of these unpleasant things.
You can get a “Sterling" Thresher and “1.H.C." Engine, and avoid
them all.
Capacity approximately 25 bushels of wheat or 50 bushels of oats
per hour.
Enables you to thresh 3,000 bushel crop of wheat in two weeks,
and at just such a time as it suits you.
You will be surprised at the low price we charge, and the easy
terms we offer.
It's a positive fact, and we will prove it to your satisfaction if
you'll let us do so, that the money you would otherwise pay to the
ihresherman will buy this outfit for you.
When it's paid for, you'll still have a good engine and a good
thresher to “show for it."
If you keep cn with the thresher gang you'll have the receipts to
show for the money you have spent. Which is best for you?
Must have your order early or you are certain to be disappointed.
Now is the best time to begin the saving.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts. *
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way yoy may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can't tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts tlmt are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the' Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
/ a *
c> „ o
»,( V /
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-)' um has
been chosen after years of experiei.. •; as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. 'When age comes
the car-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the, absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the AVilson Ear-Drums.
AYe have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. A’ou may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(.they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a, single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair y6u
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. AVe do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and (he
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

Speeding' Up!

YOUli profit is determined by your ability
to turn out work, and especially an extra
quantitjr of work in a given time.
Speeding up on a slow-action “ low effi-
ciency ” Machine Tool usually leads to friction.
It’s the Modern Machine Tool, designed with
convenient motions, and replete with modern
time-saving devices, that makes for rapid pro-
duction —without “ speeding up.”
Power, wages and capital cost have
increased, but it has been easily proved that,
pound for pound ot’ metal removed, the cost of
machining is less on the Modern Machine Tool
than on the old —and more satisfaction is given
by the workman.

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT A
* SMOKE* IS TILL YOU’VE
TRIED MY CIGARS
a*4A\>
I’M going to have my Cigars smoked over every
part of Australasia—and the most confirmed
pipe-smokers are going to be the biggest
smokers of my Cigars, too.
Talk abopt joy! Why, to sit round a camp
fire, over a billy of tea, pitching to your mates,
each of you smoking one of my Cigars, joy isn’t
in it! It's just simply bliss!
As the yarns go round, the blue smoke
curling upwards in a fragrant cloud, the
smooth cool Havana flavor lingering on your
lips—l tell you, you’ll spend some of the
happiest hours of your life.
x
gj
Letters are coming in to
me in shoals from all over
Australasia, praising up my
Cigars. Take one I've just
got as I write this, for in-
stance —it’s from a chap on a
cattle station up in Northern
Queensland. He writes:—
“Those DIADEM AS Cigars
ofyoursare just alright. I’ve
always smoked a pipe—but
no more. Not that I’ve given
up pipe-smoking altogether;
but when I want areal smoke
—something rich—l light up
one of your DIADEMAS,
and give myself up to its
pure enjoyment.”
To make you acquainted
with my Cigars, and prove
their value, I make you this
FREE OFFER of
5 or 6 CIGARS
you may select.
Send for 100 of any of
Remit the amount, and
I will deliver promptly,
postage or carriage paid,
to any address in Aus-
tralia.
Smoke 5 op 6 of them, and if they’re
not superior to most Cigars at double the
price, send the remainder back to me, and
I’ll return every penny of your money—no
charge made for the Cigars you’ve smoked.
My Cigars are made from the very finest
mild, rich mellow Tobacco, the filling or inside
heart of the cigar being all straight long
leaf. The Cigars are hand-made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before
it goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed
to burn freely and draw easily.
There sno “ catch ” about this offer—it’s just
plain and honest. To prove ity you can refer
as to my financial position and way of doing
business to the Manager of the Commercial Bank
of Australia, Collins Street, Melbourne. He’ll
vouch for me.
Send down for a box to-day—once you smoke
them you'll make it a habit, and buy regularly
from me. When ordering, say whether you
like light, medium, or dark colors.

The Salvors of the Planet
Venus.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON the Nor’-West Coast, near Gerald-
ton, are the Houtman's Abrolhos, and
nearly 20 miles north is Cape Ron-
sard.
Crayth and Wagstaff stood on one of the
Houtman Rocks looking landward to the sky
where showed the mirage of the elevated
breakers of Pelsart Island, and then seaward
again to their work.
It was emergency w T ork—the work of the
off-season in pearling, the work of men
who take risks and chances at the bidding of
anything with a romance in it. Wagstaff
had heard confirmatory reports of the trea-
sure of Pelsart’s ships, the Zeewyck and the
Batavia, wrecked on the Abrolhos in 1G29,
and coral-grown, after the mutiny of the Ba-
tavia and the hanging of mutineers on the
Australian shore. Besides, many other
Dutch ships on their way around the Cape
of Good Hope to the Dutch Indies here came
to w r reck. It was not only for the treasure
of the Batavia and the Zeewyck; Wagstaff
had found records of the Vergulde Draeck,
the liidderschap, the Van Holland, the Zuys-
dorp and others, and at least the quest gave
them a reason for working in the off season.
They had been over the three divisions of
the AbrolhosI—Pelsart 1 —Pelsart group, Wallaby group
and Rat Island group—all coral ridges
formed of dead coral and coralinfe limestone,
and but llift. above the sea, growing only
thickets of thorn and belts of mangrove.
The lagoons patched in light greeh and dark
green ; a sky cloudless; the coral a-wash ; the
breakers ori the distant reef, and raised up
as a background by mirage.
They had found guano, which they did
not value as much as they should ; they had
walked over millions of birds’-nests, through
millions of screeching, vicious, sooty terns,
gulls and petrels that darkened the sky, and
had been first deafened by, and then had
grown used to, the screaming of the, wide-
awakes as in clouds they landed at the
breeding grounds. As the niates moved
about tile island they broke yellow and
orange eggs of tern and noddy by the hun-
dred.
“I'm sick of it, Jack. Coral glare and
breakers and mirage all day and the shriek-
ing of the birds day and night.” ;
“We’ll give Pelsart’s dollars best wher-
ever are ; but we'll have another look at
the outside reef near North Wallaby first.”
“If I weren’t tricked so often by the mir-
age,” said Wagstaff, “I’d say that there dr<*
two palm trees without tops growing on that
reef.” 1 ■;
“It can't be,” said Crayth. “I see no-
thing.” And he spoke truly, for the mirage
had played another fantastic trick, and the
two black verticals were seen no more.
So they sailed south back to Rat Island
to prepare for their removal to Geraldton
prior to sailing the Margaret back to Torres
Straits, and so forgot all about the two
Mates of the Reef.
Those two black verticals like pencils set
on end on the fringing reef were really the
half-submerged masts of the steamer Planet
Venus.
In 'Geraldton three weeks later they had
Dinny O'Rourke’s letter informing them of
the wreck, and stating that he had con-
tracted with the underwriters for the Mar-
garet to recover gbld to the value of £50,000
shipped at Fremantle by Holt and Burgess
to the ofder of Holt and Burgess, Singapore.
The Planet Venus was hopelessly wrecked,
O'Rourke continued, outside the fringing
teef of North Wallaby, and was said to be in
Six-fathom water, with only a portion of her
showing.
When the Margaret sailed in from sea to
the reef north of North Wallaby, the mirage
behind the breakers deceived them no longer.
Affd there was something more strange in a
ketch anchored near the two lead pencils
stood on end.
From the side of the strange ketch hung
a ladder, a lifeline and an air-tube; on her
deck a pump slowly turned under the hands
of two Malays. A thin white man acted as
tender.
“Somebody at the job,” said Crayth.
“Hail them, Jack.”
Wagstaff called out “Ketch ahoy,” and the
reply came back very clearly in the clear air.
“Hullo?”
“You’re not diving to the ship?”
“No —shell.”
“Right-o! Keep clear of the Wreck —we’re
representing the underwriters.”
“It’s a queer place to come to for shell,”
said Crayth. “They’d get more shell north
in a week than they’d get here in a month of
Sundays. I think they’re well worth watch-
ing.”
The thought made with more certainty
when they saw the diver return to surface
bringing with him an almost empty shell net.
In the bulky dress of canvas and rubber his
figure loomed monstrous —a shambling, stoop-
ing-shouldered thing, almost obscene in its
monkey actions —and when the helmet was
lifted, Crayth and Wagstaff saw even from
that distance the hairless face which be-
longed to Burgess, the part owner of the
Planet Venus.
“Worth watching!” said Wagstaff. “Yes
—if your eyesight doesn’t get too sick to
Watch.”
Crayth made himself ready for the dive,
and dropped on to the deck of the Planet
Venus, and walked along it in three-fathom
water. He found no hatch open to admit
him to the strong-room below the main
deck, and he climbed over the rail and sank
to the sand in eight fathoms on the starboard
side, forward of the bridge.
The side of the ship showed black in the
green, and stretched away fore and aft un-
broken. He walked along over anemones
like sheaves of wheat, and anemones like
verbena, and anemones like knobby walking-
sticks. It was a garden of anemone—giant
crescents and flowers and calyces, with here
and there the beauty of sea-urchins ready
to pain and waiting to sting. From the
under-surface of a rock near by came a
slate-colored, blue-spotted devil-fish; and by
the rock a planarian, like a brilliant yellow
shrimp with red ferns growing upon it.
Fishes that had been to China for their
form, and had studied Japanese art for
their coloring; fishes like solemn footmen
dressed in arabesques and curves ot Diu
and yellow, green and red, salmon and blacK,
grey and orange, green and yellow ; fish. tj a
were all fin and tassel; aldermamcally stupi
fish with a cone of long brown pennants
waving from their heads ; mad fish with t 1 -
tilted long noses; banded, striped, specKieci,
barred, spotted and painted fish.
An ocean current setting in from tne
equatorial Indian Ocean just misses the
Westralian coast, and brings certain eccen-
tric life only to the Abrolhos. Around
Crayth swam sea-horses and dragons red
and' striped, with back and belly termina-
tions like feather dusters ; a two-footed, red-
finned greyhound, the shoulders and the rump |
ending in a long and drooping tail. xhe
seven-rayed tassel fish and the plumed tre-
valli; a hippocampus a foot long; scarlet
sea-dragons spotted white on the head and
sides, and on the neck transverse bars ot
cobalt blue, the leaf-like appendages of the
body and tail deep crimson, with a darker
hue on the outer border; another of crimson
and lilac, frilled and furbelowed and sap-
phire-eyed. And all this wondrous color
softened by the beauteous medium of the
sea.
Craytli rounded the vessel’s stern to the
port side, and, the coral ascending, lie lifted
into four-fathom water, and found in her
track a deep groove in the coral in which his
foot slipped and held. He ran the foot along
the groove to a break in the coral, and so
pulled it out again ; but finding the groove
continuing, he continued to walk astern ot
the wreck. It might have been cut by stone-
masons, so regular was it: and Crayth knew
that it had been cut by the keel as the ship
took the coral before she met the rock at
the beginning of the deep water, and sustained
the injuries which caused her to founder.
“Imagine driving her at such a speed in
such waters!” thought Crayth. “And how
did they get in here at all so far out of
their course!”
He went to the port side of the ship and
there a surprise awaited him. An irregular
opening with a square of about 10 feet
showed in the blackness of the hull, and fish
swam through it, and the sea floor was
blackened with the masses of steel that had
fallen on its destruction.
“H’m,” said Crayth. “Where’s the rock
that did that?” He clambered through the
hole, carefully guarding his air-pipe and life-
line from the broken edges of the plates, and
stumbled over a scrap-heap—torn and
twisted bars, broken stanchions, the bottom
plates rising towards the deck, even the
outer skin opened out like a cauliflower, and
yet no rock showed to account for it. But
he saw enough to know that the strong-room
was wrecked, and that great difficulties lay
before the retrieving of the specie of the
Planet Venus.
“What did it all?” he asked himself.
“What caused this destruction from below,
leaving a deck and hull intact and tearing-
internal parts to pieces?” And in that
moment he was answered. He had mounted
bn a pile of broken steel, and it brought his
helmet close to the beams of the deck.
Strange objects of faded hues floated dead
against the deck girders. He took one in his
hand- —one of scores. It was a dead parrot-
fish, and his understanding leaped immedi-
ately to the significance of the finding.
“Dynamite! Dynamite, which always
does its greatest damage downwards: dyna-
mite which had not caused the wrecking of
the ship, but had been exploded after the
wreck'—quite recently, in fact; perhaps yes-
terday, even this morning. For what rea-
son? To cover up something. By whom?
Only the alleged pearlers could be respon-
sible-pearlers at a wreck where there was
no shell, but something to be hidden, or
stolen. The gold! That diver of the great
strength and the bestial face —he had stolen
the gold and then blown up the strong room
to hide his tracks!
He walked towards the opening, carrying
the dead fish; then suddenly rounded a
corner of dense wreckage, and saw a life-
line and an air-pipe which were not his own,
waving in the motion of the sea outside the
hull. His eye traced the line and pipe to
the helmet they fed. He turned the corner
completely, and came face to face with an-
other monster —the great, shambling brute
he had seen on the deck of the strange ketch,
and through the glass he saw the bestial
face. And then the man who was Burgess
saw the dead fish in Crayth’s hand, and with
his knife he slashed at Crayth’s air-pipe.
In a second the dress collapsed. Crayth in
the moment before unconsciousness came to
him felt his neck veins puffing, the veins of
his legs strangled, his arteries thickening as
if senility had come in a moment, his lungs
blown thin as in acute pneumonia. The
great, leaden shoulder-weights fell crushingly
on spine and breast-bone; the helmet seemed
to weigh a ton.
And then, as Burgess shot before him up
to the light, Wagstaff, who had fortunately
held the iife-line that day, felt the weight on
it, and hauled Crayth to the surface with
not a second to spare.
Wagstaff tore at the helmet while another
unscrewed the glass. Then they cut the
weights away, and slashed the canvas dress
off the unconscious man, and the black
boys brought hot bottles and brandy. While
they set themselves to the work of resuscita-
tion. Burgess had been drawn up the ladder
of the strange ketch, which now lifted
anchor and stood out over the reef seaward.
None on the Margaret observed her, all
were too busy with the almost-drowned diver
to think of the cause for the accident.
After 15 minutes of foi’cing the currents
of life to return to the unconscious man,
George Crayth opened his eyes "and smiled
in feeble reassurance when he saw the al-
leged hard and cynical Wagstaff weeping in
fear for his friend.
They would not let him talk, and he lay
like a log until evening, and then insisted
on speaking, saying that he was well but for
a slight paralysis in the arm and leg
muscles. And then he told them of the
strange diver who had come round by the bows
while he had walked from the stern ; and, won-
dering, they examined the air-pipe, and
found it cut clean through as with an axe.
“They’ve stolen the gold!” said Crayth.
“Board them, and get it back again.”
He was told that the strange ketch had
disappeared, and then he said, with a return
of almost all his own energy, that they must
hurry to Geraldton and telegraph the under-
writers. And hurry they did, and the Mar-
garet anchored off Geraldton pier next day

BA B Y GIIEEN,
cured by Zam-Buk.
A MOTHER’S INTERESTING STORY.
'THE hospital doctor recommended
1 Zam=Buk to Mrs. G. Green, of
57 Thomas Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, for a terrible scald sus-
tained by her little boy, and such
professional recommendation proves
the marvellous superiority of Zam-
Buk over all ointments and salves.
Mrs. Green says :
“My little boy, John, was nearly scalded to
death through a kettle of boiling water up-
setting over him. The shock almost stopped
his heart beating. The whole of his left side
was in a terrible state, and we thought he
would succumb to his injuries. It was an
anxious time for me, I can assure you. He
was in terrible agony; his flesh was half-
cooked, the skin peeled off, and he was red
raw. Many home treatments were tried, and
although we did all we could to get rid of the
great sores which formed all down his body
as a result of the scald, they would not heal,
and the poor little I’elloW suffered for nine
long months.
“I took him to the hospital, and after at-
tending to the wounds, the Doctor recom-
mended me to use Zam-Huk for home treat-
ment. Acting under his instructions, I pur-
chased a pot of this splendid Halm, and
applied it to the sores night and morning,
until, presently, signs of improvement were
noticed. The Zam-Huk cooled the irritation
and allayed the pain, reduced the inflammation, cleansed and purified the under and
surface tissues, and commenced to heal the flesh nicely. All symptoms of dangerous
complications, which had previously threatened, were entirely expelled by Zam-Huk,
and after a patient course of treatment with the halm, John’s wounds were com-
pletely and perfectly healed with sound, new, healthy skin. Although the injuries
were so dangerous and extensive, not a scar remains, for Zam-Huk made ms nesn sou
;and clear, and without blemish. , . ~
“This being my experience with Zam-Huk, it gives me great pleasure in mention-
ing the few foregoing facts in support of its marvellous virtues, and I trust they will
be the means of doing good to others, who may chance to read this, and who may not
be aware of the benefits to be derived from this famous Halm, which we enthusiasti-
'■allv rAonmmAnrl tn all.”

and the mates hurried ashore. But the
strange ketch was seen no more anywhere
on the 11,000 miles of Australian coast.
It disappeared utterly. The gold was gone.
They telegraphed the underwriters as to
the insurance on the gold, and were an-
swered that strange rumors were abroad on
the affairs of llolt and Burgess, and that
the insurance in their particular case had
been withheld, as Holt and Burgess were
missing.
“Wire them for full powers. Jack. Even
if they’ve got the gold we can get some-
iliing back for the underwriters.”
The underwriters’ answering telegram
gave them full power to engage other divers
and salve all that was worth the trouble in
the Planet Venus.
Laboriously they cleared up the fragments
of steel, and found a steel door with the
locks fastened and projecting.
“There you are again,” said Crayth, talk-
ing to his helmet as usual. “They blew it
down from the outside, and they need only
have blown the door off. It’s another puzzle.”
And the next day the puzzle was explained.
They found and brought to surface the gold
boxes, and, wondering more distractedly
than ever, opened them, and found-—lead !
“That clears it,” said Wagstaff. “They
ring the changes on the boxes after shipment,
and then run her over the reef into the deep
lagoon thinking she'll be such a total wreck
that she’ll sink out of sight, and nobody
ever be able to examine her. And then they
hear that her masts are out of water, anil
that the. underwriters are going to dive for
the specie, and Burgess sails here before us
and blows up the strong-room so that we
can’t find out that gold changes to lead when
it gets wrecked.”
“He’s got nothing out of it, anyway,” said
Crayth. “But I’d like to wring the brute’s
nock. I’ll remember him b.v the numbness
in my arm and leg for a hit.”
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
La Tripolitana.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRIO —short for Onofrio—dwells in a
remote recess of Middle Harbor. He
is a Sicilian. At least he thinks
he is. The basis of him is certainly Greek,
but the rest is probably Spaniard spiced
with Arab. He is short and strong and
brown and hairy, and his calling is that of
the Twelve Apostles. And when I men-
tioned Tripoli to him he had a short fit of
insanity. Wildly he rushed to and fro for a
space in front of his humpy—then suddenly
halted and commenced a series of fantastic
capers that had nevertheless a rude kind
of rhythm about them. When he pulled up,
breathless, and asked me what that was, I
said I supposed it was some kind of dance.
“Dansa?” he repeated. “Yais, verra
fine dansa. Nuova dansa. I male’ ’im
myself, an’ I call ’im ‘La Tripolitana.’
Verra god nem, dat, eh?”
“les,” I said —holding out to Frio the
pouch of peace. “A good name enough, but
what has your dance to do with Tripoli?”
“Vit Tripoli? Vy, seemply dat I dansa
on la barba —da bearda —of il Turco mala-
detto- —de dam dirtee scoun’rel of a Toorrk!”
Frio himself might have defied competi-
tion in the matter of personal uncleanli-
ness, but I took the expression as a mere
flower of speech, and with apparent ingenu-
ousness mildly inquired why the imaginary
Turk was thus maltreated.
Frio stared at me incredulously. “You
no reada da pipper? You no ’ear dat
Eetalee grrab Tripoli from da dam rrotten
Toork ?”
“Oh, yes,” I said carelessly. “And a
pretty impudent piece of robbery it was!”
The explosion I had counted on was de-
layed only till Frio had made certain of my
meaning. Then he danced again; but this
time it was a war-dance. Ilis eyes glared;
his teeth glistened; his beard bristled; his
arms and legs whirled around as if they
were trying to fly off the trunk.
“Robbairee!” he spluttered. “You dam
Engleeshman talk ’bout robbairee! Vy!—
vy!” Words wouldn’t come. He plucked
his knife viciously from the sheath. It was
a fishing-knife in theory, but I wasn’t too
sure that it wasn't going to be a stabbing-
knife in practice. I prepared for a rear-
guard action. My boat was not far away,
and step by step I retreated, with my face
to the foe. He followed at an equal pace,
demonstrating unpleasantly with the kpife,
and gradually getting his objurgatory gpns
to bear.
“Da robbairs of da lan’ an ! sea —dd
blasted Engleesli—ha !”
I took three backward steps.
“Vat about da Eendia —ha?” Frio was
with me again.
Three mpre steps and a swift glance over
my shoulder. A few irmre backward paces
and I should be able to reach my boat with
a little run.
“Vat about da Nort Amayreeca—da Sout
Afreca —ha ?”
Here I suddenly wheeled, and in half a
dozen seconds was in my boat and had
pushed 10 feet away from the rotten little
jetty. From this post of vantage I calmly
addressed Frio.
‘‘Nations have no consciences, Frio mio.
Every pation grabs all it can, and holds
on for all it’s worth.”
Frio came on to the jetty. “Dam Eng-
leesh robbairs! You steala ’alf da blankee
vorld. You”
“Say, Frio, what nation tried to, grab,
Abyssinia, and got infernally well licked?”
Frio promptly threw the knife at me. It
fell ipto the boat, and Frio fell into the
water. His foot had slipped on the slimy
woodwork, and noble was the splash of
him.
I pushed hastily farther out, and presently
up bobbed Frio’s head, spitting salt water
and curses.
Not without difficulty he clambered back
on to the jetty.
“You trowa me back dat knifa!” he
screamed, as soon as he had got his hair out
of his eyes.
“You forgetta I’m dam English robbair,”
I mimicked. “I steala dat knifa.” I got
my sculls into the water and pulled off for
about 50 yards. Then I held the knife
aloft for Frio to see, and solemnly dropped
it overboard. And, as I pulled farther and
farther from the spot, there came to me
brokenly on the breeze: “Robbair! Tief!
Scoun’rel! Peeg!”
ALEX, E. MONTGOMERY.
A Missing Moses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Regarding the Referendum, we will have to make
another appeal to the country. And next time I
hope that the vote will be Yes. — Prime Minister
Fisher.
THEN—
“ AY, the time’s not ripe,” said
I \ Pharaoh, down in Egypt long ago,
1 Whilst the Hebrew deputation
bowed their heads, and bowed them low.
“Let the ’Brews continue serving, making
tiles and bricks for Me;
For the time’s not ripe for swerving towards
the Promised Land," said he.
Then quoth Moses: “I’ve a notion that
events will prove you’re wrong—
We’ll be tramping forth from Goshen
towards the Promised Land ere long!”
So ... he went and prayed with Aaron, and
when plagues • assorted thrived,
“Oh, call off your dies,” said Pharaoh, “for
the Time Has Now Arrived !
“You may pack your Hebrew bundles, and
proceed at once,” said he;
“For I’m sick of boils and locusts and
strange insects in my tea!
Take the track at once to Canaan —yea, be-
gone this very hour;
If I lind these Yids remainin’, I shall wax
extremely sour!
You’ve been treated well,” sobbed Fharaoh,
“and a most ungrateful crew
Are these Hebrews in the brickyard—what
is Egypt coming to?
Here I gave you work in plenty, but you ve
‘squared’ the Lord,” said he—
“ ’Tisn't work we want,” quoth Moses. “We
are thirsting to be Free!”
So the Chosen steered for Canaan, Moses
marching at their head,
With the bones of ancient Joseph—as that:
prophet-mail had said !
And the Hebrews camped in Etliam, where
the wilderness begins,
Whilst the heart of Pharaoh, seethin’, blazed
with many beers and gins!
“Nay, the time’s not ripe,” said Pharaoh;
"I was daft to let them go;
Who will labor in my brick-yards? I’ll get
even yet with Mo.!
I’ll be square with him for dropping curious
beetles in mv tea;
Drag those Hebrews back to Egypt, and
step lively now,” said P.!
So the Army hitched its trousers, and, with
chariots of war,
It pursued Jehovah’s Children towards
Baal-zephon by the shore.
Then the Lord spake in the thunders: “Bid
your folk depend on me.
By my ancient signs and wonders I will set
this people free!”
To these words did Judah hearken, and be-
side the Red Sea coast
They were buried impolitely —all the great
Egyptian host.
Then the Children cheered for Moses, and
when Pharaoh heard the news,
There was cursing down in Egypt re the
vile, ungrateful Jews!
—AND NOW!
“Nay, the time’s not ripe,” our Pharaoh
yelled in anger yester-year;
As he gazed upon the Fusion, he repeated:
“Yah, no fear!”
“What! The Time’s Not Ripe?” said
Fisher. “Well, I beg to disagree” ;
“Mine are ancient paths of Slowgress,”
from his throne responded P.!
Then observed our Moses Fisher: “Towards
the Promised Land ere long
We’ll be moving in our thousands, and
events will prove you’re wrong!”
Bo he went and roused the Chosen, and when
angry Labor hived,
“Here! I’m off- —you’ve won !” yelled Phar-
aoh, “since the Time Has Now Arrived!
“You may take the reins of Office, and pro-
pel this Land,” said he,
“Whilst I flagellate, the Fusion for its vast
iniquitee!
Thanks to Cook,” he groaned in sorrow,
“Aaron Hughes is now' in power;
But, maybe, I’ll win to-morrow,” and his
smile was very sour!
“You’ve been treated well,” said Pharaoh,
“and a most ungrateful crew
Are these folks who follow Fisher; what s
Australia comipg to?
Here I gave you work in plenty, now you
jump my throne,” said he
‘“Blpw ypur work,” said Moses Fisher. “We
are bursting to b.e Free!”
Sp the Children marched to Office, Moses
Fisher at their head,
With the programme-bones of Watson, as
that prophet-man had said!
Then the Chosen yelled “Hosannah! This
is Labor’s boshter hour!”
Whilst the Fusion’s trampled banner turned
the heart of Pharaoh sour!
“Nay, the time’s not ripe,” said Pharaoh,
“Aaron Hughes will have to go;
Darn that dreary Bill-preparer —I’ll get even
yet with Mo!
Like the other, older Pharaoh, he found in-
sects. in his tea.
“Go. and bust this Referendum, Wade; step
lively there!” said he.
Hence, the Army greased its jawbone, and
with shrill State Frights galore,
It pursued the Referendum, howling loudly
for its gore! • T , . .
And this Land said unto Fisher: II hither
Goest Thou?” Said he :
“I am making tracks for Britain and the
Coronation spree!
Aaron Hughes is well-provided —he wall lead
you with his jaw';
Towmrds the Tnrone my steps are guided,
and I don’t see any flaw !”
Thus, levanted Moses Fisher, and, when
Pharaoh heard tue news,
There was joy among the Stummicks, and
they mocked at Aaron Hughes!
For, when Pharaoh, down in Egypt, changed
his mind and shouted “No!”
Moses’ stove-pipe did not glisten at a Coron-
ation show !
He was there with Brother Aaron at Baal-
zephon by the shore,
And his whiskers waved triumphant, and
his hat was full of gore.
But, alas ! our weary Moses left the Chosen
in the lurch,
So the Effitman still reposes on his combina-
tion-perch !
Wherefore now our Moses Fisher hears the
Children’s mocking “Yes !
It was JGiaraoh's Coronation licked us in
the Wilderness /”
