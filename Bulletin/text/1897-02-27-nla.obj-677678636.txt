EDWARD PENFIELD.
WILL BRADLEY.
A book full of artistic suggestion is the recently-
published “Posters in Miniature,” in which
E i ward Penfield— whom Will Bradley, his clever
brother craftsman, calls “ first among designers of
po.-uyrs in America to-day,”—reproduces in black
and white many score of striking posters. In his
introduction Penfield says :
Within the past few years the w’ord Poster has been
growing in significance, until now we look upon it as
describing a decoration, thoroughly fin de sifeole, and
perhaps pleasing.
A poster should tell its story at once—a design that
needs study is not a poster, no matter how well it is
executed.
A poster has to play to the public over the variety
stage, so to speak—to come on with a personality of its
own and to remain but a few moments. We are a bit
tired of the very serious nowadays, and a little frivolity
is refreshing ; and yet frivolity to be successful must be
most thoroughly studied. I think it was one of the
Beggarstaff Brothers who said: ‘Our designs may not
look as if much time was spent upon them, but I can
assure you that it has taken ali the artistic knowledge we
possess to bring them to the simple state in which you
see them.’
Some posters, consisting of but a few lines and contain-
ing but a few broad masses of color, require a dozen
drawings before simplicity and harmony of color are ob-
tained.
A poster, to be effective, must have the same qualities
that a good painting possesses—color, simplicity, and
composition—but must be expressed in a different
manner.
Some of the designs reproduced on this page,
though so small in size, can suggest what fine effects
they would gi ve when treated in colors, and on poster
scale. France and America lead in the rivalry,
with England not far behind. Penfield himself
lives in New York, as art editor of Harper’s
Magazine; Will Bradley is close by, at Spring-
field, Mass. ; Cheret is a Parisian.
Why do not Australians who want posters en-
courage Australian artists to draw and Australian
printers to produce them? The Sydney Daily
Telegraph, for example, issued a large poster
recently, neatly printed in colours, but designed
on the easiest geometrical plan, and destitute of
artistic attraction. A much better one in point of
art and effect could have ‘ been secured at little
more cost, if the Telegraph had desired it.
Henry Lawson writes regarding the Bush and
the Ideal —
British ignorance of Australia is certainly no
greater than the coastal Australian’s ignorance of the
Australian back-country. The people of our cities look
at the bush proper through the green spectacles of bush
bards and nevr-chum press-writers, and are content—
wisely, if they knew it—to sit down all their lives on the
rim of Australia.
* * » »
No one who has not been there can realise the awful
desolation of Out-Back in ordinary seasons: few even
of those who have tramped there can realise it. One
might imagine a tropical jungle, a “glittering” ice-field,
a “rolling” prairie, a “Northern” forest, an “African”
desert; but not a mighty stretch of country which is
neither desert, nor fertile land, nor anything else you can
think of—except thousands of miles of patchy scrub. A
region which is not quite desert enough to be provided
with oases, nor tolerable enough to have permanent
rivers. A region where there are no seasons to speak of;
where the surface will bake for nine months or a year >
and then suddenly become a boundless marsh ; where the
single river, flowing between drought-baked banks and
under blazing skies, will rise from a muddy gutter to a
second Mississippi, because of the Northern rains. A
country where human life can just exist; a country that
carries sheep with difficulty in fair seasons—though at
first sight you would think it incapable of carrying goats
at its best—and their worst.
* * * *
If the back country were a desert we might love it, as
the Arabs are alleged to love their desert, for the sake of
the oases ; if it were a region of noble ranges, mighty
forests, shining rivers, broad lakes, and grassy plains, we
would love it for these things ; as it is, we don’t know
how to take it, and prefer not to take it at all—at least
not until a general earthquake or a mighty scheme of
irrigation breaks the dreadful monotony, and alters the
face of it beyond recognition.
* * » *
I have been accused of painting the bush in the darkest
colors from some equally-dark personal motives. I might
be biassed—having been there ; but it is time the general
public knew' the back country as it is, if only for the sake
of the bush outcasts who have to tramp for ever through
broiling mulga scrub and baking lignum, or across blazing
plains by endlese tracks of red dust and grey, through a.
land of living death.
* * * *
After reading bush literature in prose and verse, and
after trying the bush for myself, I feel inclined to doubt,
all scenery that is boomed. But Bill and Jim do not see
the bush as it is ; and if they w'rite verses about it—as
they frequently do in camp—they put in shining rivers
and grassy plains, and western hills, and dawn and morn
and eve and gloaming, and forest boles of gigantic size—
everything, in fact, which is not and never was in bush
scenery or language; and the more the drought bakes
them the more .inspired they seem to become. Perhaps
they unconsciously see the bush as it should be, and their
literature is the result of a craving for the ideal.
♦ * * *
I watched a mate of mine sit down in camp on the
parched Warrego—which was a dusty gutter with a streak
of w’ater like dirty milk—and write about “ the broad,
shining Darling.” The Darling, when we had lastseenit,
was a narrow' streak of mud between ashen banks, with
a barge bogged in it. Two weeks later this mate was
sitting in a dusty depression in the surface, which he
alleged was the channel of a river called the Paroo,
writing an ode to “ the rippling Warrego.”
* * * •
The average Australian bushman may exult in the bush
because he has never seen any decent country to compare
it with. Maoriland shearers clear out by the next boat
they can catch after they get their cheques. But my
Warrego bard was born in St. Petersburg, and had
travelled through France and some of the fairest countries
on earth. Ideal bush literature is an interesting subject,
anyway, and it is written and accepted as realistic by the
bushmen themselves. Its popularity is wonderful, and
most pathetic.
» * * *
The moral is the universal one: “ Let us irrigate ”
» » * *
The bush bard, in fact, is temporarily blinded
to the Real by the intensity of his vision of the
Ideal. Sun-pictures fade idly on his retina ; his
brain is stimulated by a Light from Within. It is
a case not uncommon —
The lover “ beauteous Helen ” names
Some Ethiop black as coal;
For Cupid takes, to light his flames,
The arrays of the Soul.
The mother of a horse-faced boy,
Who hugs his dirty poll
With “ Pretty child 1 ” will, sure, employ
The arrays of the Soul.
The bard who writes “fair, shining lake”
Instead of “ muddy hole,”
And “ trees ” for “ mulga scrub,” must take
The cc-rays of the Soul.
No wonder seek the Wordsworth hand
That “ light ” from pole to pole:
They never shone “ on sea or land ”
The arrays of the Soul.
Melb. Argus talks of Stead’s “transcendental
harem.” [Nobody takes Stead very seriously just
now except the Review op Reviews readers,
who have no option in the matter ; and a London
correspondent the other day added up quite an
appalling list of his pricked bubbles from “the
Maiden Tribute” to Count Mattei, and away
past Count Mattei—some dozen of reams of
detailed rhetorical exaggeration with half-a-page
of truth at bottom. By the way, Stead is ob-
viously the person to bracket with Marie Corelli
as an Idol of the Illiterate.] Stead’s combination
of sex-mania and religious-mania makes such a
thing almost indispensable. There is distinct
connection between the religious warmth of the
Mahomedans and the warm number of houris
allotted to the individual true believer; and reli-
gious ecstacy is full of questions like that which
bothered the nun Blanbekin. It would be the
most natural thing in the world for Stead
to seek in dreams the satisfactions which his
spiritual creed denies him at Mowbray House.
And a transcendental harem, well-managed, has
many advantages over anything possible in flesh
and blood and the Strand. Its members are
literally all your fancy paints them ; they never
quarrel, and can be pensioned off without trouble ;
and they are cheaply purchased with a slight
effort of the imagination. Perhaps they do wear
a little thin, but that is better than wearing thick
—and most women fatten horribly in harems
unless the. attendants are very particular about
the baths and the bottled stout. Yes, Stead is
decidedly right, as unusual.
* * * *
The average man misuses the female stimulus.
Taken transcendentally in small doses (one hopes
Stead takes it in small doses) there is no tonic
more invigorating. We once knew a man who
was obviously unhappy he moped and
fretted, had no pleasure in life, and read
the books praised in the Melbourne Abgus.
They brought him a niece to tickle, and
he tickled her. It was purely a platonic
tickling, but it did the man good. Gradu-
ally the wrinkles went out of his forehead
and the tired look from his eyes. He grew plump
and contented, and his employers raised< his
salary. Then the niece died, or was married, or
something. There was no other female relative
whom the man could get as substitute. So he
went to the bad—took to drinking, lost his situ-
ation, lied, thieved, “did” two years in gaol.
Then he was “converted ” by the Salvation Army*
and became a member of Parliament for Balmain
and invented popular questions—such as “ What
would you do to Butler if yon caught him?”—for
Is. 6d. competitions in the Sunday papers, and
that was the end of him—all because he had never
heard of Stead’s transcendental harem.
The author, E. Planta Nesbit, of Adelaide
sends for notice a little book called “Christ’
Christians, and Christianity,” published some
time ago as the first of seven treatises on Christian
evidence and doctrine. Mr. Nesbit has read ex-
tensively and eom’iu'nts judiciously, though he
shrinks from pressing home his conclusions against
the divinity of Jesus. His a posteriori argument
to prove Jesus an Essene, witli its corollaries, is
hardly necessary nowadays for any but the
doggedly faithful; since the progress of know-
ledge, astronomical and other, has made the
anthropocentric myth a priori ludicrous. But the
familiar points are well handled ; the illustrations
and quotations are interesting; and the book
should have value for people still struggling in the
mental garrote of dogmatic religion.

Andrew Lang is a bright and industrious man
of letters, who is growing dull now that he is
growing old. His merits were absurdly ex-
aggerated by the log-rolling clique of which he
was a member —he has lost caste with the
younger men —for he never said any new and
vital thing in all his days, though he has gambolled
pleasantly along time-worn paths. And George
Moore, falling foul of him in Sat. Review, sums
him up neatly—
It happened to me to spend a few days last summer in
an English village. As I drove from the railway station
to the lodging which had been hired forme, I noticed a
pleasant river, which seemed to promise excellent fishing.
I mentioned the river to my landlady.
‘ Oh yes, sir,’ she said, ‘there is very good fishing here
—many people come here for fishing.’
‘ What kind of people come here? ’ I asked distractedly,
‘ Literary gentlemen come here very often, sir ; we had
Mr. Andrew Lang staying here.’
*Oh really . . . does he fish ? Is he a good fisher-
man ? ’
‘Yes, sir; he fishes beautifully.’
‘ Really! Does he catch much ? ’
‘No, sir; he never catches anything, but he fishes
beautifully.’
Tub Bulletin’s London corres. : ‘ J. M. Barrie is sequel-
ising “Sentimental Tommy.” Allen Upward, fietionist
and dramatist, is preparing a novel novel—all in verse.
Stanley Weyman’s “Shrewsbury” and Conan Doyle’s
“Uncle Bernac” have commenced in the magazines.
Zola is engaged on “ Paris,” the last of " Les Trois Villes ”,
series. Phil May’s “Guttersnipes” are highly praised,
and the artist has been elected a member of the Royal
Institute of Painters.’
The ingenious Max Beerbohm’s parodies are among the
most interesting things in Saturday Review's shining
artistic supplement. Max isn’t 25 yet, but seems almost
as precocious as the University youth of the Middle Ages,
who took his degree—whatever it was worth—at 16,
with credit and nonchalance. The parodies are not as
exaggerated as Bret Harte’s ‘ Condensed Novels ’ ; and
Meredith and Marie Corelli, in particular, are just cari-
oattired' enough t 6 be admirable. And an end which
crowns the work is the writer’s parody of himself.
Lond. Academy has very much improved of late. It
has a new owner—J. M. Richards, father of ‘ John Oliver
Hobbes ’ and manufacturer of Carter’s Little Liver Pills.
Both his products are stimulating.
THE AIR.
The air is made of oxygen
And gas and germs and things ;
It lifts the little sparrow s when
They only flap their wings.
The air is very, very light;
I can not understand
Why, when I grasp some of it tight
I have an empty hand.
If with an axe I chop the air,
Or poke it with a pole,
I know I make a fissure there,
But who can s 'e the hole ?
If I should saw the air in chunks,
I know I’d soon lose heart;
For I could never keep the hunks
Of sawn-up air apart.
The rain and hail fall through the air,
As likewise does the snow' ;
You’d think they'd punch holes everywhere;
But they do not, you know.
I often think about the air,
Because it is so queer ;
It is around us everywhere,
All through t ie atmosphere.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*

A unique figure in the world’s liquor-trade
is T. W. Stanford, the amiable Melb. identity,
whose houseful of pictures has for years been a
Erivate show-place. Mr. Stanford is only an
onorary member of the trade. He acts as agent
for grape brandy from the famous Vina Vineyard
(Cal.) —the vineyard being part of the estate with
which his late brother, Leland Stanford, endowed
a university—-and in the most unbusinesslike
manner he regrets that the Melbourne agency
isn’t doing much for the good cause. The Vina
brandy appears to be too pure for the taste of the
average household consumer and too expensive
for ordinary hotel expenses—in fact, it is only
sold as a liqueur over a few bars. But a noble
tipple for the “educated palate.” The true in-
fluence of brandy upon the human interior —
meaning the stomach, not the head —remains un-
known to one who'has never tasted a drop of the
20-year-old Vina brand, which costs fifteen shil-
lings a bottle, or thereabouts. Australian taste
would pretty soon get educated up to that if it
could rise to the giddy altitude of the price.
The younger stuff—none of it younger than four
years—is cheaper, of course, and is the same
liquor, minus the extra mellowness.*

Item from a young girl’s evidence in Wel-
lington (M.L.) police-court : “ Father thrashed us
all regularly, but he never missed going to church.
He took us all to church with him. He swore all
the way going to church aud all the way home,
and he always thrashed us as soon as we got
home. Father never swore in church, but he
generally swore as soon as he got out.”
Melb. Argus excuses “ Yellow ” Astor for
changing his nationality :
It is plain he finds in England a more congenial society,
a pleasanter life, and a wider field of social ambition than
his native land can give him.
Fancy the Argus going out of its way to pay
America such a lavish compliment! Presently
America will be devising a new impost, a tax
on Yankee-Britishers. The sequestration of half
their American possessions would about fit the
case.
The Maoris have an alphabet which con-
tains neither £, s nor d, and the result is that
no interpreter has ever made money out
of the native race. The same reason makes a
Maori such refractory ore to crush debts out of.
On the other hand, it was ignorance of the magic
triliteral which permitted the Maoris to be so
easily robbed of their land, before they learnt the
English alphabet.
The fallibility of the police was shown at
the Newtown (Sydney) Police Court on a recent
day. An insurance collector, charged with em-
bezzlement, having been given six months, his
attorney asked that the sentence be suspended
under the First Offenders Act. The police ob-
jected : “He has been sentenced three times for
larceny.” The accused went into the box, and
swore that he had never before been convicted of
any offence, great or small. The magistrate
believed him, and dealt with him as a first
offender—and then the police admitted that they
had mistaken him for another man “intoirley.”
Specimen of ‘ ‘ English as she is wrote in
India ” —commended to Australian tailors whose
customers delay unduly the payment of their little
accounts:—
Kind Sir, I humbly most respectably beg solicit the favor
of your that I beg to inform you that yourpromised is past
to pay the amount and interest is more increased the
whole amount 300 Rs. Three hundred rupees. Will you
do so good enough highly on me if you kindly remit me
a draft on the Loodianah Treasury shall feel much oblige
your by doing so, because I have much desire for the
money in these days, therefore I have take the liberty to
trouble in your honor with these lines if you kindly
remittance, extremely oblige in these days. I have pur-
chased 4 bunglows, and now too much require the money;
if you do in such a time kind and favor for remit to
money, much oblige in this time you do on me help,
thousand obliges on me; and beside of this took place a
marriage of my brother’s, is now extremly desire for
money, extremly oblige your. I remain, Sir, your most
obdt. servt., Nihal, Tailor.
Dear Bulletin, —Be your par. anenfc per-
sonal appearance as an adjunct to success, I have
noticed that two classes of men—commonly sup-
posed to be heavily handicapped in the social race
—usually turn out best. I refer to the ugly and the
bashful individuals. Ugliness forces its possessor
to the cultivation of those sterling accomplish-
ments without which permanent prosperity is
almost impossible, and the sympathy it first
excites in women frequently kindles later a
passion inexplicable to mere beauty - men.
Bashfulness hides often a consciousness of real
power in one line of intellectual work, coupled
with a painful sense of incompetence in the
trivialities of everyday life ; and as modesty and
roguery rarely combine it follows that the “quiet”
party is also the honest and capable one. Neither
Ugliness nor bashfulness can disadvantage its
possessor in the long run, as the numerous in-
stances of modern history will prove.— Romy.
Probably the most disgusted little crowd in
Australia just now is composed of the three mid-
night marauders who burgled a store at Ascot Yale
(Melb.). They spent several hours and much
toil and blanky and perspiration cutting the back
out of the safe. When the job was about done,
they found that the safe was unlocked, and con-
tained only half-a-dozen stamps. Then something
scared them, and they fled in such haste that they
left most of their tools behind. Same night they
burgled Moonee Ponds P. 0., but a policeman
interrupted them, and they bolted in confusion,
leaving more tools behind. Then presumably
they went home in disgust and kicked the
“ missus.” After such a night, any average Bill
Sikes must kick somebody.
R. : “At Geelong (Yic.) police-court, the
other day, an intelligent lad of 13 said he had at-
tended the State school, but did not understand
the nature of an oath, whereon an asinine magis-
trate piously and piteously ejaculated : 1 That is
only the product of the present Godless system of
education.’ The boy, however, should rather have
been congratulated on keeping the excellent com-
pany of Huxley, Spencer, Tyndall, Renan, Dar-
win, Haeckel, Yirchow—surely a better battalion
than that of the petty parsonlets and formula-
gabblers who profess, in the vastness of their
ignorance, to know what lies beyond Time and
Space and what was before the beginning. Be-
sides, if a fractured oath is inevitably followed by
eternal punishment, where is the sense or need of
a perjury-law to add an infinitesimal fleabite of
time in gaol to an eternity in hell ? ”
Man isn’t the only animal that loves to sip
the barley bree. The other day a Scotch poultry-
keeper proceeded against a distillery co. for turn-
ing its refuse into the “burn ” which ran through
his yard. Before the co. did this, his hens and
ducks were good, useful, conscientious birds, lay-
ing their three eggs regularly every day and five
on Sabbath. Afterwards they all went and got
drunk in the burn all day, and wouldn’t lay worth
a cent. On Sundays the distillery stopped work-
mgs, and the hens, deprived of their daily grog,
suffered horribly in the first stages of “recovery.”
The birds would never eat their breakfast in
the morning till they had been to the burn
for a drink, and they were always more or
less under the influence of liquor. Prosecu-
tor thought a hen he had bought at Fort
William found out the burn first, and she led the
rest astray. He produced the Fort William hen,
which was not sober. It sat on the bottom of the
cage and put its long neck through the bars,
looked sideways at the ceiling, crooning to itself
in what was termed a “maudlin style” by the
prosecutor. This was always noticed, he further
stated, when it was “far gone.” At this stage
the hen woke up to address some forcible remarks
to the judge, who ordered it to be taken away.
Examination continued : Was this hen at the distillery
burn this morning ?—Anyone could see that. (Laughter.)
How are the other hens to-day?—Worse than this one.
Was this the only one you could take to court?—Yes.
Why ?—The rest were too drunk. So that on the whole
the Fort-William hen is not the worst ? —That is so. How
do you account for that ?—She can stand it better.
Cross-examined : What do the hens do when they re-
turn from the burn ?—Sleep. Anything else ? —After a
sleep they generally fight. Have you no sober hens at
all?—Yes, but the drunk ones break their eggs.
The judge reserved his decision.

AFTER CHRISTMAS.
Lay aside the sorry flowers !
Put the withered leaves away !
Darlings once of summer bowers,
They are dead as yesterday—
Dead as all the greetings vain
That we fashioned of their bloom ;
Let no faded fronds remain :
Take them from the work-day room—
Put them for a year away !
What have we to do with Peace —
Who from morn-star until eve
Know of struggle no surcease—
That we utter make-believe ?
All the “ kindness ” Christmas brings
With the year begins to fail;
Here it lies with broken wings
Pitifully poor and frail—
Put it with the flowers away !
Better far because so true
Is the cruel, grim To-day ;
Peace and Goodwill would not do
For our weapons in the fray.
Fix your good old daggers on,
And have done with compromise ;
There is business to be done
Lre we wreathe once more in lies
Flowers like these we put away.
C. KENDALL.
CHARITY.
The other day, as I sat down to sup,
A tiny beetle fell into my cup.
While yet the cruel walls of glass were foiling
Its feeble efforts, just a touch of mine
Preserved its life—and kept the brute from spoiling
The rare and dainty flavor of my wine.
I met a beggar, trying in the street
In vain to stay the coming, going feet.
I heard a sob, a tale of hopeless toiling ;
I searched my purse and gave, and fed his wife,
Just to prevent an anguished face from spoiling
The glad and even tenor of my life.
Q-
VON KOTZE.
A SEA TRAGEDY.
And he lies there,
With the sand in his mouth and the salt in his
hair ;
And I stand here,
Naked and burnt in the blazing sun :
And the Sea lies calm,
Shining and blue in the morning air,
Sweetly unconscious of what it has done.
Curse you, O Sea !
You have robbed him of life and me of a friend —
Wrecked us and tossed us here on the shore,
Just when the toil of our life was o’er.
Curse you, O Sea !
We have loved you and fought you many a year,
Laughed at your fury many a time,
Met you in peace and met you in storm ;
And now, as we gave you our last goodbye,
You act as a treacherous, cruel foe;
You have robbed me of fortune and friend at a
blow.
Naked I am on the blazing sand—
Not even a knife to dig him a grave:
Foodless, waterless here—in a land
As bare of life as that gleaming wave.
Faithful old chum !
We have lived together so many years
I do not care to part from you now.
Come ! I can lift you up in my arms,
Swim with you just a few fathoms from shore,
And sink with you into the Nevermore.

A noon, an eve, a night,
He heard them with shut ears,
And saw it with shut eyes.
Before the new delight
Fled spectral, white-faced fears,
Grim-mouthed with agonies.
A noon, an eve, a night
He lived in Paradise !
A thousand miles away
His feet had trod the land,
A barren, lonely plain,
Where heat-waves, night and day,
Rolled o’er a burning sand
That knew not any rain.
A thousand miles away—
And madness in his brain !
At last a Paradise,
A noon, an eve, a night,
Burst on him where he lay.
He saw a fountain rise,
With sprays of water bright,
And heard his children play.
At last a Paradise,
A thousand miles away.
A noon, an eve, a night,
A thousand miles away,
Within a lonely land,
He saw the waters bright,
And heard his children play
Around the marble stand.
A noon, an eve, a night—
And Death crept down the sand !

“The Bulletin’s ” Federal Ticket.
Herewith The Bulletin offers to the people
of New South Wales, Victoria, South Aus-
tralia and Tasmania its Federal Convention
ticket. And it asks the electors of the four
provinces to roll up on the 4th of March and
each make a large, unmistakeable cross
against the ten names given for his particular
province :
NEW SOUTH WALES.
G. H. Reid (Premier).
Edmund Barton.
J. T. Walker.
James Ashton.
E. D. Millen.
William Hughes.
J. 0. Watson.
Dr. W. P. Cullen.

Philip Fysh (Treasurer).
Edward Braddon (Premier).
W. Moore (Chief Secretary).
F. W. Piesse.
John Henry.
A. J. Ogilvy.
Henry Button.
* * * *
With regard to the above list, The Bulle-
tin can allege with confidence that the
sectarian issue and the fiscal issue have both
been absolutely ignored. No name has been
put on or left "off the ticket because the
bearer of it was a Freetrader, or Protec-
tionist, or Revenue Tariffist, or Single-
taxer, unless his utterances showed that
he was so deeply wedded to his fiscal
creed that he was resolved at any cost to
drag that wholly irrelevant question into the
deliberations of the Convention. The Con-
vention has nothing whatever to do with
fiscal theories, except that it must agree to
the abolition of all tariffs inside the Com-
monwealth for the sake of peace and unity ;
and it must provide a Constitution whereby
the people of Australia can decide, as easily
and effectively as may be, what sort of tariff
they will have against the world outside. If
the majority resolves that it wants a 500 per
cent, tariff on everything, or that it wants to
have absolute Freetrade in everything and
to raise the required Federal revenue from
some other source than Customs duties, that
is for the majority to decide when the
Federal machine is in working order, and
the matter concerns the Convention not at
all. Likewise, no man has been put on or
omitted from the ticket because he is a
Catholic, Jew, Presbyterian, agnostic, Sal-
vationist, or belongs to any other variety of
religious belief or unbelief. Even the Car-
dinal would have been included, despite The
Bulletin’s own protest against his ill-
advisedness in inserting his lurid sacer-
dotal robe into the contest, if he had
seemed to be even the tenth part
of a-shade wiser and better-informed and more
decided on the questions at issue than Wise
or BartoS* or Carruthers. Having made
its protest against the strife-stirring aspect
of Mr. Moran, this paper would have gladly
admitted him in his political aspect if he had
possessed one —-only his proposal that the
present discordant tariffs might be permitted
to rage inside the Commonwealth for a dozen
years or so marked him out as one of the
most hopeless and inefficient candidates in
the four provinces.
* » * *
As regards New South Wales, the chief
difficulty was to find ten candidates who
were not absolutely provincial in spirit, and
who wanted to federate at all in the real sense
of the term. The Prudent Party may be
dismissed as consisting of five distinct anti-
Federalists, who desire to keep the railways
and public debts under provincial control,
and who tell amazing fish-stories about the
prospective ruin of New South Wales, and
whose mission it is to make the Federal
Government an impotent, useless, and penni-
less affair of no purpose whatever. The
Bulletin has no very detailed ideas
about the views of any of the five ; the
mere obvious fact that they are absolutely
against Federation damns them utterly. Al-
most all the prominent Protectionists are left
out because they demand, with unaccountable
unanimity, that the railways should remain
under the same chaotic management as here-
tofore. Various other candidates are omitted
because they peremptorily insist on the
Federal capital being located at Sydney. If
any one of the existing capital cities is selected,
the chances are certainly very much in
favor of Sydney, but if, in a convention of
four provinces, one insists on its sole right
to select the Federal city all by itself, it is
going the shortest road to wreck the whole
movement. Most of the Labor members
are reluctantly struck off the list because of
their announcement that the Federal Con-
stitution must be their Constitution —the
whole of it, down to the smallest of the
published details, with no amendment what-
ever. It is, on the whole, a very good
Constitution, but if one province goes to the
Convention with a bald statement that it
must be allowed to decide everything, and that
no one else is to have a voice in deciding
anything, the prospects of Federation are
very small indeed. Therefore, two of the
most brainy and least unreasonable members
of the party are included in the list, and the
other eight are passed. Also, Speaker
Abbott is passed because that great man
gave no statement of his views at all, and
desired the community to “go it blind ” on
him, apparently because he is a Speaker, a
great boss Freemason, a potentate of the
A.M.P. society, and an old, uncertain, hack
politician over 6ft. high.
Nine of the New South Wales candidates
on The Bulletin’s list are placed there abso-
lutely on their own merits, as set forth in
their addresses to the electors. The tenth,
Premier Reid, is added partly on his merits
as a dubious Federationist, who may go
straighter than expected, and mostly because
he and his party dominate Parliament, and,
as Parliament has.power to make or mar the
scheme even after the Convention has done
with it, Premier Reid practically holds the
whole business in his own hands. To leave
out of the work of Constitution-making the
man who, above all others, so far as New
South Wales is concerned, can wreck the
Constitution, is obviously futile ; even if he
were left out, he would have more power
than all the 10 who got in, so his exclusion
would be an absurdity.
* * * *
The same, or even a worse, necessity for
offering sacrifice to Mammon causes The
Bulletin to place the astounding name of
Frederick Sargood on its list of Victorian
candidates. In Victoria no provincial party
has arisen as in New South Wales ; the
fiscal issue hasn’t come into the contest,
except where the weak, unconsidered voice
of Murray Smith has been lifted in flabby
denunciation ; and the sectarian issue hasn’t
even been heard of. The Victorian trouble
resolves itself into a struggle between the
Liberal and Progressive party, and the most
cast-irott Conservatism to be found on this
continent. The Bulletin recommends nine
reliable Democrats with respectable records
and good intelligence and no obstructive fads
worth speaking of, and it adds the most
objectionable Conservative of the lot as being,
in its opinion, a necessary and unavoidable
evil. If the Federal scheme is wrecked in
Victoria it will probably be wrecked by
the Council on the ground that Property
and Fat are not sufficiently represented in
the Federal Constitution. Sargood, the
vain and cantankerous little drapery warrior,
owns that House of 48 Rich Landlords, body
and soul and intellect, and if Sargood s
vanity is not placated by a place in the Con-
vention and a voice—even though it be a
futile one —in the making of the Constitu-
tion, the chances of the Federal scheme
coming to shipwreck are multiplied by ten.
Therefore, The Bulletin advises Victoria
to give Sargood a vote from motives of
policy, and to try to look as if it was doing
so from motives of personal admiration.
And having thus done all it can to placate
Sargood this paper urges the province to
stand by with a pick and be ready to take
strong measures with its Upper House at a
moment’s notice, in case Sargood isn’t pla-
cated after all.
* * * *
Of the ten candidates on the South Aus-
tralian list, every name is included on its
owner’s merits, and with no reservation
whatever. S.A. has evolved fewer burning
questions, and seems more unaninioutsly favor-
able than either New South Wales Or Victoria.
It has produced 12 candidates to whom The
Bulletin would gladly give a vote apiece,
but as only ten are required the above list
is offered as the best selection that seems
possible. If the names of Josiah Symon
and James llowe look somewhat strange in
company with the other eight, it can only be
urged that their utterances show them to
have a clear and liberal idea of what an Aus-
tralian Federation ought to be —so clear and
liberal that they could not reasonably be
omitted, so two others whom this paper
parted with reluctantly, but who seemed a
shade less definite in their views, went over-
board to make room for them. As for the
ten Tasmanians, the names of Ronald Smith,
James Paton, Ogilvy, and Piesse are
presented without any reservation, and,
of the others, at least five are offered in
a small, hesitating way, as a scratch crowd
who are perhaps a trifle less scratchy than
any other crowd that might be collected. In
the Land of Lots of Sleep the Federal
question seems to be accepted in a coma-
tose fashion alleviated by catalepsy. Hardly
one of the many candidates has said anything
very definite about his views on the most
important questions at issue—some of them
have said nothing at all on any point of real
importance. Also, nobody seems to care
very much about anybody’s views. Tas-
mania will have the same voting power and
might have the same influence at the Con-
vention as New South Wales or Victoria,
but it is apparently going into the movement
in a small, crushed fashion, prepared to
accept any luck that befalls it. Therefore,
the Tasmanian list is the only one which
this paper doesn’t view with complete satis-
faction. And with this explanation The
Bulletin’s Federal ticket is presented to
its readers accompanied by an urgent request
that they will all vote and all vote straight.
And having thus indicated the men whom it
hopes to see at the head of the poll, it
indulges a hope that three conspicuous
fossils, Duncan Gillies of Victoria, Hey-
don of New South Wales, and Samuel
Tomkinscn of South Australia, will be as
near the bottom as they can conveniently
arrive at.
Equal Laws for Equal Sexes.
Editor Bulletin, —The strong-minded woman,
in Australasia and elsewhere, belongs usually
to the aborted male type. Her logic usually
belongs to the aborted female type.
* » • *
The strong-minded woman wants the suffrage
in Australasia because (she says) the duties
which women perform for the community are
as important as those which men perform. The
average woman is as intelligent as the average
man, and she has a right to assist in making
the laws which she is expected to obey. Men
and women are equal : let them be equal before
the law.—Two male Parliaments admitted the
justice of these arguments, and the suffrage
was granted to women.
* * * ♦
The strong-minded woman wants “ the age
of consent ” raised throughout Australasia
because (she says) the average young woman is
not so intelligent as the average young man.
She is ignorant; he is cunning. She is inex-
perienced ; he is experienced. He knows, and
she does not, what will happen should she
“fall.” Therefore, raise the age of consent —
for young women. Young men and young
women are unequal: let them be unequal before
the law. —Male Parliaments have so far
admitted the justice of these arguments
that there is an “ age of consent ” in
every Australasian province—for girls. The
boys are unprotected. When a lustful
man seduces a girl he may be fined, or
imprisoned, or even flogged—whether a child be
born or not. When a lustful woman seduces
and depraves a handsome boy the law cannot
touch her.
* * * •
As Australasian fathers have protected their
daughters, Australasian mothers in S.A. and
Maoriland, with a direct voice in the govern-
ment, should endeavour to protect their sons.
• * * *
At Wellington, M.L., on Jan. 15 last, a
youth 18 years of age, earning ss. per week,
was ordered by a magistrate to pay 7s. 6<l.
weekly for the maintenance of his illegitimate
child. The mother was an innocent little girl
aged 26. The affecting picture of how, by
horrible arts, this child’s base betrayer cor-
rupted her virgin mind, is better left to the
strong-minded woman’s imagination.
Carefully note this instance of “ the shocking
inequality of the laws made by men in their
own interests.” The male has no vote : the
female is an elector, with full civic rights. He
is not old enough to hold property or to have
a voice in the government of the country ; but
he is old enough to “ consent to his own ruin,”
and to be fined 2s. 6d. per week more than he
earns. And this is male justice.
* • * *
Here is a letter (identificatory details omitted)
stating facts which, in one shape or another,
frequently reach newspapers :
Re the “ Age of consent for boys,” take the case of
my 15-year-old brother. About the end of 1895
a family moved into a house at the rear of one occupied
by my father and his family. With the former family wan
a servant girl (or woman) 21 years of age.
A few months ago the family and servant girl moved
away and some time after removal my father was sur-
prised to get a letter from the father of the servant girl
apprising him of the fact that said girl was about to
become a mother, and that he hoped his (my father’s) son
would do the honourable, &c., as he was the father of the
child ” (The boy has just completed his 15th year.) _
My father wrote to the girl’s father and acquainted hitl!
with the boy’s age and pointed out that the girl was cer-
tainly the seducer. The man evidently saw the justice of
this and nothing further was heard from him. But the
girl now tried her prentice (?) hand. She wrote to my
father, telling him that the child was born, and that she
could prove that his son was the father Of it; also, if he
didn’t settle the matter to her satisfaction, she would
take further pfdceedirigs. Also, that she had written td
the boy and had got no satisfaction from him. On being
questioned, the boy admitted gettirig the letter, and alsd
the fact that he had had illicit intimacy with the girl;
Further questioning elicited the fact that the girl had
made a point of retiring early very often on a plea of
sickness or headache, and used to leave her bedroom
window open on purpose for the lad to get through. The
relations started a few months after the boy had com-
pleted his 14th year, and at the girl’s invitation-she
having asked the lad into her bedroom during the family’s
temporary absence. *
Enough for my brother’s experience. 1 can remember
being enticed by girls four or five years older than myself
to go with them under an abandoned house before I was
14 years old.
And so on. Who has ever heard a strong-
minded woman shrieking about the “ruin”
of lads so led into vicious courses by a
libidinous female at the outset of manhood?
And note, had sex and age been reversed, the
young man of 21 would probably have been
flogged for his ruthless seduction of a girl of 14.
The young woman of 21 who -seduces the boy
of 14 goes free.
°** * . *
Of course, it cannot be pretended that
seduction by females is as common as seduc-
tion by males. In the encounter of sexes,
the woman is naturally passive. Convention
and constitution make it more difficult for her
to become an active wooer. But she can entice,
and she does. Her glance is often an invita-
tion, her smile a consent. She deliberately
lights the fuse, conscious or reckless of the
coming explosion ; flutters the white , flag of
surrender before the enemy has dreamt of
attacking the fortress. It is easy to believe
that the average Australian girl is quite as well
able to defend herself as the average Austra-
lian boy—if she chooses. The family safe-
guards are all for her, none for him ; ami the
social safeguards also. If, at a dangerous age,
she do not know her danger, she should be
taught. If, knowing her danger, she court
it, then her responsibility is, on the average,
as great as that of a boy at the same age.
Whenever the boy “ sins” the girl “ sins” too.
Whenever the girl “ falls ” the boy “ falls ”
too. There is no moral or practical difference
between them, and there should be no legal
difference.
* * * *
Then, should there be an “ age of consent”?
There should be an age of protection—for both
sexes. It is to the interest of the community
that its boys and girls should grow up
stalwart men and women, and the too early
intimacy of individuals is prejudicial to the
physique of the race. But the limit of the
age of protection is obviously fixed by the be-
ginning of the age of marriage. If a com-
munity licenses its members to marry in church
at 12 years old it cannot reasonably punish
them because they marry out of church at 14
years old. The marriage is the vital thing }
not the church, If a gir lof 12 is “ ruined ”by
unlicensed intimacy with a man of 30, or a boy
of 12 is “ ruined” by unlicensed intimacy with
a woman of 30, then she or he is equally
“ruined” by a similar intimacy licensed by
law. Practically, indeed, the unlicensed inti-
macy of 30 and 12 on a few stolen occasions is
less likely to produce evil results than the inti-
macy of lifelong matrimony. I do not say
that the existing Australasian marriage
ages are the right ages, but they are the
right limits of protection. The question is
purely a physical one ; and if the community
decides that boys and girls are fit for union at a
certain age it stultifies itself by saying they are
unfit for union after that age.
* * * *
There remains the point of poaching within
the area of the protected age. Obviously, it is
impossible to frame a law that will fit all
climates and individuals. But certain conclu-
sions commend themselves logically and practi-
cally. If both parties to intimacy are within
the age of protection they should be held
equally responsible. If one is within the age
and one beyond it, then culpability should attach
only to the one beyond it, independently of
sex. The measure of culpability would be con-
ditioned by age and circumstances. The ques-

reasonable age of protection. Beyond that age
it would be dealt with on similar lines. For
equal sexes let there be equal responsibility. —

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Poor Beggar Brooks.
A clever London journalist the “ Note
Book ” writer for the Referee —moralises upon
the case of one Brooks, a begging-letter-writer
lately gaoled for obtaining money under false
pretences. Brooks made a steady income of
.£l2OO a year, or so, by trading upon what the


rugged Referee sage calls “the cant of
generosity, a peculiarly paltry form of human
weakness.” The rogue, after careful study and
test of all the motives which prompt alms-
giving from people in easy circumstances, had
eel Lied down to this form of appeal : “ In medi-
tating upon the infinite goodness of God this
morning, and reading His Holy Word, it was
borne in upon me that I ought to solicit your
help,” &c. Such a letter (as the commentator
suggests) would appear transparently fraudu-
lent to any worldly-minded capitalist, male or
female. Its style reeks of imposture. No
Bulletin reader would feel inclined to
give aught save a kick to the author,
whereas one might easily be favorably
impressed by an epistle beginning thus”:
“I have a wife and six children whom I
try to maintain respectably, but I have bad
lung-disease, and my employment is pre-
carious.” Mr. Brooks’s experience, however,
taught him that reasonable charity— i.e.,
sans cant—is not very susceptible to written
appeals from unknown correspondents, no
matter how ingeniously constructed, and so he
confined his attack to the smaller class of
“ charitable ” mortals, who walk in fear of hell-
fire, and give money away to Scripture-quoting
beggars less for the pleasure of assisting a pos-
sible hard case than because they can thereby
persuade themselves that they are giving to the
Lord and purchasing salvation by instalments.
Their generosity comes not from the head or
the heart but from a cant-created conscience
which cant alone can touch. Brooks, the
hypocritical loafer, is not the worst evil
maintained by these self - seeking ser-
vants of the Lord. Brooks did very
little harm to anybody better than him-
self, seeing that the cant offerings of his
benefactors are seldom bestowed upon honest
men. Indeed, it is questionable whether
Brooks was entitled to go to prison. He sup-
plied a demand. Church religion was always
wanting to hear from Brooks, and his letters
duly arrived. His income was quite as legiti-
mate as that of the average parson, who lives
by preaching the particular kind of religion
(viz., “ the infinite goodness of God”) echoed
by Brooks in his begging letters. The Bulle-
tin begs to move that Brooks be released from
gaol and permitted to resume work in that
station of life to which it hath pleased the
Lord to call him.

The Q. Labor Split.
W. Kidston, M.L.A., writes from Rockhamp-
ton, Q. :
There is no split in the Queensland parliamentary
Labor-party. There is doubtless, as there is in every
political party, a certain amount of personal antipathy
and personal jealousy at work, which occasionally comes
to the surface in an unseemly way, and which may cause
a split some day unless our members are all the wiser.
But meanwhile the party is just as solid, for all practical
purposes, as ever it was. As to the composition of the
party also, you are somewhat at fault. You say—“ Its
strength lies, for the most part, in the Western bush-
laborers, though the miners are usually among its sup-
porters, and it has adherents—not always reliable—among
the artisans of the towns. It gets small help from the
farmers —who are either servile or conservative.” Now
the bald facts are : The bush unions return three mem-
bers ; what may be called mining constituencies return
seven ; while the “unreliable artisans of the town,” with
the help of two or three farming districts, return the
other ten members. You insinuate that in the matter of
the Q.N.B. the large majority of our members acted from
the most unworthy motives ; were lamentably weak, or
worse, that we were “wheedled in detail,”' which, I
assume, means that we were nobbled by Nelson and Co.
All which is untrue and grossly unfair to men who,
whether they decided wisely or unwisely, certainly
acted with a full knowledge of the gravity of the
situation and of their personal responsibility. The
“ wheedling in detail” theory is pure romance. The
Govt, were strong with a solid majority behind them,
which made personal wheedling of Labor-members un-
necessary. Whatever communication took place between
our party and the Govt, took place through the recog-
nised leader of our party, and was discussed in caucus.
At the first introduction of the question, we, as a party,
decided to insist upon a satisfactory committee of inquiry
by having the Auditor-General included in that com-
mittee. Later on, we agreed that we would consent to
no legislation until the report of the committee was
before us, and on those points the party acted unani-
mously. But we also further agreed that when the
report of the committee was in our hands, each
member of the party was to be at liberty in dealing with
any proposal that might be brought forward based on
that report. In accordance with that agreement, 13 of
us accepted the recommendation of the committee and
supported the Guarantee Bill, while six, preferring what
they doubtless considered the less evil of liquidation,
opposed the Bill. Each section of us, of course, thought
our own decision the wiser, but, from a party point of
view, as we had previously decided to leave each other
free-handed, neither had a right to complain of the other.
And only the unwise action of the Worker and some ill-
tempered cross-firingconsequenton it made the difference
of opinion notable, or of any party significance at all. At a
ater stage we were just as unanimous again in insisting
on an assurance of full enquiry into the past management
of the bank before agreeing to further legislation respect-
ing it. Indeed, in this matter of the Q.N.B. the Q. Labor-
party acted, it seems to me, on the only principle on
which such a party can act and remain a party—namely,
in essentials, unity ; in matters of detail, liberty.
Whether we are big-minded enough to practise the third
part of that old precept, “In all things, charity,” time
will show. But certain I am that no member of our
party who appreciates as he ought to the devotion of the
thousands of outside workers which has made the party
will allow a small-minded intolerance of a needful and
healthy diversity of opinion to produce a split, which
would at once gratify our enemies and blight the hopes
of our friends. -
Mr. Kidston, of course, as a Democrat who re-
fused (quite legitimately) to sign the Labor-
party platform, cannot claim to speak officially
for the Labor-party. Most of his letter refers
to matters of opinion, on which Mr. K. is per-
fectly entitled to his own. The Bulletin
calls the division in the party a split, and Mr.
Kidston may call it what he darn well pleases.
The feud between the TozER-haunting Glassey
section and the official Worker section may
not be as deep as a well or as wide as a church-
dbor, but it is there all right—or all wrong.
The estimate of the relative strength of classes
supporting the L.P. is perfectly correct. The
bush workers don’t return representatives in
proportion to their numbers because they are
robbed of their votes ; but their enthusiasm
and their solid cash has always been and is
now the backbone of the L.P. The miners (i.e. ,
the miners who work in towns) are not so re-
liable. Gympie, for example, the oldest of the
mining townships, returns two Boodlewraithers.
And the property vote in the towns is the bul-
wark of Boodlewraith ; while the farmers are
generally timid time-servers, who can be
bribed the week before election with a sugar-
mill or a cut-up squattage. “Wheedling” means
wheedling ; if this paper had meant nobbling it
would have said “nobbling.” And nobody
who noted the sudden change in the manners of
the surly Nelson, Tozer and Co., during the
momentous period when Q.N.B. relief was
under consideration, and watched the simple
Glassey and others basking in the unaccus-
tomed warmth of Ministerial flattery, could have
the least doubt that some of the lime stuck to
the birds.—Ed. B.
The N.S.W. Unemployed.
Joseph Greer, boss of Sydney Labor Bureau,
bas sent in a report on the doings of that harrow-
ing institution for the last six months. Mr.
Greer takes a cheerful view of things in strict
moderation, and hoorays within certain limits.
He says that, at 31st December, there was “ a
marked diminution in the number of unem-
ployed in the city and suburbs,” as compared
with the condition of things at June 30th, and,
as 762 men were sent away to the Bogan scrub-
cutting works between September and Decem-
ber, this statement seems eminently probable.
If the sudden removal of nearly ] per cent, of
the adult male population didn’t relieve the
labor-market, things would be desperate indeed.
Mr. Creer says that the unemployed are now
so few that it is difficult even to get up a
demonstration at “ the Statoo,” but he also adds
that “ dozens ” of good men are daily applying
for scrub-cutting work at the Bogan. In the
building trade men are scarce—-through so
many of the best workmen having left for W.A.
and South Africa. As another reason why the
unemployed rage less furiously than they did,
it is explained that 3069 men have had spells of
work at Shea’s Creek, 1542 at Botany relief
works, and 752 at the Rand wick chufch and
school lands. The total number assisted and
sent to work for the half-year was 7612 at the
Sydney bureau, and 386 at country branches—
-7998 in all. This would be at the rate of
15,996 per annum, if it. were not that Mr.
Greer reports the second half of the year to
have been considerably better than the first;
apparently, therefore, the year’s total is more
than that figure. The number thus assisted
in 1894 was 10,349, and in ’95 it was
16,380, so despite several years of continuous
relief, and the removal of a large number
of people to Westralia and elsewhere, things
remain very much where they were. The
number of unemployed registered at the Sydney
office was 1279 less than in the previous half-
year—which is the one distinctively cheering
feature in the report; but even then the total
number who applied for work during the year
was 8145, and the 5227 unemployed dealt with
by the Benevolent Asylum upsets the calcula-
tions a good deal. The Labor Bureau is a
quaint affair in some ways. In 1894 it found
work for 5833 people, and it chucked 4516 more
out into the country to look for gold and fos-
sick in creeks and gullies, and it puts this
down as 10,349 people supplied with em-
ployment. In 1895 it found billets for
5662 people, but it sent no less than
10,718 to fossick for gold in places from
which they wouldn’t get back to worry the
bureau for some time, and it calls this 16,380
people supplied with employment. This year
full particulars are still wanting, but so far it
seems that “finding employment” means prin-
cipally finding Government relief work, and
that employment in the ordinary sense of the
term is about as scarce as ever, despite the
diminution of the city population, and the
decrease in the number of the workless multi-
tude which ought to accompany it. Altogether
Joe Creer’s wisdom in hooraying on a strictly
moderate basis is self-evident.

An allegedly well-informed correspondent
writes :
The narrow escape from another fatal railway smash at
Redfern the other week gives occasion for the repetition
of the stereotyped newspaper phrase about the “ wonder-
ful immunity from serious accidents” attendant on the
career of the New South Wales railways. But nothing is
ever said about the lucky misses. Shortly after the
quadruplication of the suburban line, an in-going train
travelled from Petersham to Stanmore on the out-going
line. The mistake was never noticed till the train got to
Stanmore, when the passengers saw that if they got out
as usual on the left hand side of the train they would fall
on the track. Fortunately an out-going train was not
met with. At the beginning of this month the out-going
Queensland express, while standing at the Redfern plat-
form, had a very narrow shave. Some carriages were
being shunted to a road alongside, and the shunter did
not notice till they were close on the engine of the express
that there was not sufficient room for them to clear it.
He immediately signalled to the engine to stop, and,
although the empty train was travelling at a good speed,
it very fortunately managed to stop just one foot clear of
the express. So near was it that the driver and stoker of
the express jumped off their engine on to the platform.
“ The extension of the railway system to the deep w'aters
of Port Jackson is the lesson to be learned from the two
recent railway smashes at Redfern.” Such is the hack-
neyed cry’ of people generally forgetful of two important
facts—namely, that the agitation for the city railway is
backed by a large property interest, which will only coun-
tenance a scheme that will go through the lands of a cer-
tain “ring”; and that if the difficult question of the
route were decided—an amicable settlement having been
come to between land-owners and the Government, and
all existing leases and tenures having run out—the con-
struction of the line, with its bridges and tunnels and
other engineering difficulties, and the erection of terminal
buildings, platforms, sidings, and sheds, would take at
least three years to accomplish. In the meantime fresh
accidents might be occurring at Redfern every other
week. “ Human fallibility ”is a constant factor, and the
best mechanical device can never put right a badly-con-
structed terminus.
In all the great railway termini of the world there are
incoming and outgoing roads—that is to say, there are
certain platforms which are set aside for incoming trains
only', and others for outgoing trains. And these platforms
are directly communicating with what is known as in-
coming and outgoing lines, thus the possibility of trains
coming in opposite directions colliding is entirely re-
moved. In Sydney, trains arrive at and depart from the
same platforms, and oftentimes the incoming engine is
wedged in at the end of the platform until the emptied
train has been shunted, or another engine has taken the
train out again, which is bad, regarded from a technical
standpoint.
When the Sydney station was original]}’' built, there
was one main double line only, and that double line exists
to day. Then the line was quadrupled, and from the four
pair of main lines all the lines to the several platforms
branch off. And, if these platform lines branched off
each from the nearest main line, the chance of accident
would be minimised, but, unfortunately, the main and
platform lines cross and intercross in the most untoward
and bewildering manner imaginable, and the wonder to
those acquainted with the matter is that accidents are not
more frequent. At a very little distance from the station
proper, the main traffic is interrupted by the Mortuary
and Darling Harbor line on the one side, and goods shunt-
ing operations on the other—the produce-yard being on
the Prince Alfred Park side of the Sydney station.
Under these circumstances, whether a city railway is
constructed or not, it is absolutely necessary that the
conditions of the Redfern yard should be modernised as
soon as possible. The goods-traffic and goods-shunting
should be relegated to Darling Harbor, and if more plat-
form accommodation is needed let it be taken in hand at
once. It should not be possible for in and out trains to
“ slew ” on to one another, for there is plenty’ of room on
the south side of the railway premises for additional lines
to be built if necessary. Far better to spend money im-
proving' the present terminus than compensating the
friends of the deceased and injured. Even if the railway
reached to Port Jackson, Redfern would still be the
central station, and it should be as permanently and
safely constructed as it is possible for it to be.

“Nix” to The Bulletin:—
Do the parents, who are so anxious to place their
daughters in the N.S.W. public service as pupil-teachers,
know that there are hundreds of, not mere girls, but
women who have passed their majority, who have served
their term as pupil-teachers, have passed all their exami-
nations, and have been in the service from four to seven
years, and are receiving the munificent salary of E 46 per
annum without allowances? When girls enter the service
it is tacitly understood (the Dept, of Public Instruction
always makes a one-sided bargain) that, after four years
as pupil-teachers on a nominal salary, they will receive
employment which will, at least, give them a living; but
such is not the case. From one to three more years must
be served on the nominal salary ! Of course, it might be
argued that the Dept, has not. positions to give them ;
but that is the fault of the Dept, for taking more pupil-
teachers than it needs, and is no excuse forgiving such low
salaries. The girls, while waiting, are doing the work of
assistant teachers, and, therefore, in justice should re-
ceive fair salaries. As matters now stand parents support
their daughters and present their services to the Dept,
for a consideration of £46 per annum. No wonder thou-
sands of pounds can be saved under such conditions ! The
above remarks do not in the least apply to male pupil-
teachers. These are appointed at the end of four years
whether they pass their examinations or not. Thus we
have the anomaly of a young man having passed only
two out of his four examinations, and having taken four
years to do that, receiving appointment years before a
girl who has proved her efficiency. This has the effect, of
making young men trust to their sex instead of to their
merits.
The “ Prudent Federationists ” —otherwise the
N.S.W. Mangy Dog Party—are against Federa-
tion on the ground that under the facilities it
will offer the Riverina trade will go to Mel-
bourne and the far Western trade to Adelaide,
instead of Sydney. There is room for a lot of
hard thinking in this matter. If the aforesaid
trade goes to Melbourne or Adelaide it will be
because the people want to trade with these
cities instead of Sydney, and find it more pro-
fitable to do so. The Mangy Dog party, how-
ever, demands that, by keeping the railways
under provincial management and buildinglines
to communicate with Sydney only, they should
be compelled to trade with Sydney, whether
they want to or not. In other words, it is pro-
posed that the Sydney majority should compel
them to do so. The Mangy Dog party talks a
good deal about Liberty—which, apparently,
means the liberty of Sydney to deny the
Riverina people any liberty at all. Also, it be-
lieves considerably in Freetrade—that is, the
freedom of Sydney to make the Riverina people
trade where Sydney wants them to.
A travelling Australian writes from England
to The Bulletin :
Apropos the sending of Australian troops to England
for “ instruction ” —of course we all know it is in order
that a few fine fellows carefully picked may reflect glory
on the “ officahs it would he a good thing for the Aus-
tralian public if a dozen or so representatives from the
different police-forces were sent to take example from
their British brethren in blue in the smoothly-working
unofficious policy of non-interference prevalent in the
United Kingdom. The Australian “slop” is always burn-
ing to distinguish himself at the cost of extinguishing
someone else. He never attains to the dignity of calm
indifference, and his self-conscious stateliness is instan-
taneously ruffled by the ordinary street-boy whistling
“If you want to know the time.” I have seen many a
fracas provoked by officious policemen bullying two
or three “ Jacks ashore ” for happily, though in-
differently, harmonising in the streets on the way to
the wharves after “a night out.” Perhaps the Aus-
tralian “ slop ” has an acute ear for melody, or the
rollicking, swinging sea-songs do not appeal to his classi-
cally-cultured soul, but, nevertheless, if the authorities
controlling the enormous population of the largest city in
the world think it advisable to ignore such bacchanalian
revellers, the same leniency might well be extended to
the gaiety-seekers of Australian cities. The touchiness of
the “ slop ” is a bye-word, and the raw barrack-boys en-
trusted with night-duty are more sensitive to criticism
than a hobbledehoy girl with a scanty ten-inch-plait, fresh
home from boarding-school. The London “peeler” is
taught to regard himself as the “ people’s guide, philoso-
pher and friend”; he knows everything, and pours out his
information on the slightest provocation, and he will
stand as much chaff as a ’bus driver. He is secure in his
good-natured dignity and needs to make no petty
ebullition of bright-buttoned tyranny to convince hini-
self and the onlookers of the power in his
hands. His capabilities as a peacekeeper are
judged by his capacity to keep the peace on
his beat with as few deterrent “ runnings-in ” as
cannot be avoided. If you cannot leave your precious
seat at Lords during a big match, the obliging “ peeler ”
will convey a “glass of bitter” to your parched thorax
and accept the price of one for himself. Civility as dis-
tinguished from servility. I know much of the “slop’s”
churlishness and touchiness arises from a national pride,
not to be altogether condemned, hut nevertheless, as an
Australian, I would like to see our police confident of their
duties and dignity, and not on an irritable, unstable pivot,
to he agitated and influenced by the superlative remarks
of an exuberant, verbose drunk, or the harmless chaff of
a big-hatted, be-fringed “ donah,” intoxicated by the air
and freedom of a too-occasional holiday.
A considerable amount of dash and cuss and
blast, and language like that, has been going on
between Premier Reid and the Age, over the
former gentleman’s famous Melbourne oration
and the garbled statistics therein. The point
on which these two great institutions are bump-
ing so furiously against each other is Reid’s
question :
How was it that in the capital of that benighted desert
of Freetrade —New South Wales —the population of Sydney
increased by 35,000 in two years, while, taking Melbourne
and the six principal towns of Victoria together, in these
same two years they showed a decrease of 40,000 or 50,000.
The Age joined in the riot just here by pointing
out that in the last two years for which returns
were available, 1894 and ’95, the population of
Melbourne and suburbs increased by 7000, while
that of Sydney and suburbs diminished 13,000,
and it wanted to know if these were the two
years Reid was talking about. The N.S.W.
Premier replied, with considerable cuss-power,
that he was speaking of two years away back
(1891-93), and that in these years the popula-
tion of Sydney increased over 33,000. But as
Coghlan’s statistics show the increase for the two
years as less than 23,000, the eye-glassed person
seems to be romancing, as usual. He further
states that in the two years when the popula-
tion of Sydney declined N.S.W. was languish-
ing under the curse of Protection, which is a
very disingenuous way of putting it. The
population of Sydney didn’t really decline for
the two years, 1894 and ’95. It increased 2000
in ’94 —the Protective year—and diminished
15,000 in ’95, the year Reid began to fool with
the tariff. Also, in the two years when Reid
says the Sydney population increased 33,000,
and when it really increased 23,000, N.S.W.
was also living under Protection, and Reid
puts the increase forward as one of the good
results of Freetrade. Having thrown these
facts at each other the controversy between
the Age and N.S.W.’s manufacturer of
bogus statistics settles down into the same dash
and blast and cuss that it commenced with—
and makes no visible progress.

“C.A.J.T.” to The Bulletin on “Modern
Seafaring ” :
That Phyllis incident is not a “new” terror. Ths
British “limejuicer ” has for years been abyeword among
cosmopolitan English-speaking seamen. “ Starvation and
graft ” is the description commonly applied by such men
to life aboard British “ deepwater-ships” and “deepwater-
coasters,” such as interprovincial traders. Many a face-
tious Yankee skipper, after “speaking” a “limejuicer,”
gives him a parting shot by twisting the “distress”
signal half-way, while the hands on deck air their joking-
capacity by offering the other crew biscuits, &c., in dumb
pantomime. Further, there is no sense in our much-
bragged superiority to “ Dutchmen,” as their crews in-
variably receive more and better food than ours, and both
on “Dutchmen” and “Yanks” a man can always
get enough fresh water for domestic purposes,
while the “ limejuicer" keeps to the allowance of
three quarts per day, out of which has to come the
cook’s allowance. In the matter of wages these are fixed
by the port and not the nationality of the vessel taking
hands. In Newcastle, N.S.W., for instance, a “Yank”
from ’Frisco would probably pay a new hand lower money
than those men who joined in ’Frisco, while both Dutch
and British would have to pay higher wages. Again, the
Britisher’s foc’s’l is scandalously small, dark, and incon-
venient compared with those of other nationalities in the
same class of vessel. Moreover, what British foc’s’l isn’t
lumbered with spare gear? and what British foc’s’l is ever
painted and fumigated once in five years? The only
advantage possessed by the British sailor is that he re-
ceives more moral and religious patronage because he is
looked upon as a big child, and in this the mission folks are
right, because he hasn’t enough brains to know that he is a
fool. Clark Russell is popular because he draws his sailors
as the average, self-sufficient, ignorant shoreman supposes
them to be. To the intelligent cosmopolitan seaman
such writers as Russell and Hume Nisbet give the idea of
either deliberate or ignorant misrepresentation, because
they have only two types—the superstitious and the
scoundrel. Barring his extreme conservatism (Emerson
was wrong in crediting seamen with a larger quantity of
liberal ideas than men of other callings) the average sailor
is just an average thick-skulled worker whose greatest
concern is his stomach. Nor does he pick up much infor-
mation from his travels, as he seldom gets a run ashore
in other than British ports, and when he does his experi-
ence is limited to thelocal “ sailor-town,” which is the same
all over the world. The truest descriptions of the modern
seamen are in Kipling’s and Brady’s verse, and in some
few short-story-writers not usually contributors to Eng-
lish magazines. Wanted, a truthful marine novelist.
P.S. —My remarks don’t apply to the conditions existing
on flash “liners” which are the “show” vessels, nor to
the average passenger-boat. In further explanation, there
is a class of seamen who only sail under their own flag, so
I call the other kind “ cosmopolitan.” Men-of-warsmen I
leave out. They’re known as “ JoHNNY-all-taughts,” and
are only useful for fancy-work on the poop. The writer
has served on a man-o’-war —he deserted after seven
months —and has also been shipmates with ex- Johnnies
and found them useless in merchantmen where one man
has to do work which would be done by a dozen in the
navy.

Frankly and gaily is Fat Man’s control of the
Vic. Legislature commented upon by Melb.
Argus. A day or two before Xmas the pro-
putty oracle said: “Mr. Cuthbert rose—for
about the fiftieth time that week—to move that
the Council should not insist upon its amend-
ment, but the two Ministers were the only
‘ ayes,’ and the ‘ noes ’ were heard in a
mighty shout. And so the Insolvency Bill
was not among the measures which later
on received the Royal assent.” The “aye”
from the two Ministers was a harmless
concession to the etiquette of party-govern-
ment. Being included among Premier Turner’s
official supporters, they w’ere expected to
support a Ministerial Bill, but' for all
the good that a couple of such “ ayes ” can do
in the Council, they might just as well be dead
every time a measure for interfering with com-
mercial fraud and rascality is “ under consider-
ation.” Attempts at real reform are powerless
against that mighty shout of “no ’’which sets
the Argus chuckling fifty times a week.
If Graham Berry succeeds for the Conven-
tion his success for the Federal Parliament is
called sure. Then the exultant Duffy mounts his
father’s chair.
Treas. Fysh, of Tasmania, wails in the
local papers that, in the absence of direct incen-
tives in each ordinary electorate, only about
12,000 voters may be expected to vote at the Tas.
Federal elections. So that if five foremost candi-
dates of those nominated poll 1000 votes each the
average for the remaining, say, 20 or 25 will be
only some 400, any advance on ,which figure will
elect a man. Therefore Fysh calls on the press
to use its columns to induce a big poll so i hat
“candidates with new-born, fleeting and local in-
fluences will be left in their proper place.” The
press in Tasmania isn’t in it alongside the
breweries for active agitation, so, unless Fysh can
reticulate the country with XXX, the trouble he
anticipates will probably eventuate.
The Catholic Press makes a few remarks:
For its cartoon last week The Bulletin dug- deep down
into the rotten grave of the atrocious bigotry that for
years in this colony preyed and fattened on the lives and
substance of the Catholic community. The ugliest and
most loathsome portion of the decaying carcase—the
statement in which Sir Henry Parkes hissed forth all the
black-poisoned hate of his soul . . . dragged forth and
embodied in a cartoon, causing a foul stench in the
nostrils of every man in the colony who has an idea of
honor, decency, fair play and toleration. . . . The dwarf-
ish ugliness of low sectarianism. ... It did not hesitate
to appeal to the most degraded sectarian feelings . . .
simply execrable. . . . The infidel bigot is the most
blind, fierce, and unrelenting of all . . . viper . . .
odious . . . stoned as an infidel . . . gall and w-ormwood
. . . rabid parsons . . . curses on the Pope . . . infidel
war-cry . . . the Catholic that supports The Bulletin is
tying a rope round his heck.
The editoi of the Press is a gentle shepherd whose
front name is Joseph. Joseph’s snorts form a
glowing tribute to the accuracy of Boss Tweed’s
memorable observation : “ I don’t mind what they
write—it’s the pictures as kills me.”

point, the law had again to make an ass Of itself.
There were 29 applications for renewals and
transfers of bills of sale. The Act distinctly states
that the application must previously appear in the
columns of a newspaper which must be issued at
least once in every 26 days. The Bung party, for
economy’s sake, have hitherto advertised "these
notices in their local liquor journal, but, on ac-
count of Xmas holidays and court vacation, the
editor and comps, took a holiday from Dec. 15 to
Jan. 26—41 days—during which period the grog
rag remained unpublished, though it resumed
operations after the latter date. When the licens-
ing court sat, a cold-water lawyer protested against
the granting of the licenses, because, according to
the Act, the newspaper wasn’t a newspaper, it
having been asleep 15 days too long. The court
allowed the appeal, but this does not prevent the
applications being put on a legal basis by simply
advertising them in any of the daily papers. The
decision wipes out the liquor paper as a grog-advt
sheet, but all it has to do is to change its name,
and once more it will be the mighty engine of
Bung.

Westmacott’s co. shifted to Sydney Royal
on Saturday night and signalised its advent by
producing “ A Mother’s Sin,” a hoot in four acts,
by a person whose name is hereby consigned to
deserved oblivion. The “Sin,” except in so far
as it consists of Westmacott’s shapeless white hat,
is the same old sin with the usual unauthorised
infant at the end of it, and the infant, being oast
upon the waters, comes home to roost after many
days. At least, a wicked person in a top hat
comes in and says he is the infant, Plimmer back-
ing him up in the assertion, and it never becomes
quite clear that he isn’t; anyhow, no other infant
turns up to claim the position. Then Plimmer and
the infant plunge around in a mass of crude
horrors, and rob banks, and club men and heave
them overboard, and harry the lady with the
sin till her life is a misery, and wade in crime
fenerally. The sinful mother, played by Miss
'itzmaurice Gill, looks about the same age as
Miss Harrie Ireland, her daughter ; and Plimmer
looks younger than his alleged nephew, who is
supposed to be the unauthorised infant aforesaid ;
and Cecil Ward, who is a promising youth en-
gaged to Miss Ireland, kioks older than Plimmer,
though the latter and Miss Ireland’s mother had
grown up together more than twenty years ago.
The reinstated infant tries to get the combination
of the bank safe from Ward and goes away gnash-
ing his misshapen hat because he fails and he
can’t get at the safe without it; nevertheless he
drops in during the night and loots that safe quite
comfortably without any combination. The
plunder (<£50,000 in all) is laboriously humped
into the safe in large trays of coin, but when it is
found again, Plimmer has half of it concealed
quite comfortably inside his waistcoat. An old
lady with a band-box and a cat comes into this
remarkable bank to draw her balance but is thrown
out without getting it.
• * • •
Ward, who is the banker’s secretary, is
engaged to the banker’s daughter with her father’s
full consent, and jilts her, and the old man is
apparently so grateful to him for throwing her
overboard that he offers to say nothing of the mis-
sing <£50,000. And when <£25,000 is found inside
Plimmer’s waistcoat, it is decided to let Westma-
cott keep the other <£25,000 in the hope that he
will lead a better life thereafter. Also, everybody
agrees to say no more about the mother’s sin, and
the real infant, if there was one, doesn’t turn up ;
and a heavy parent who rushed into the drama
across a cornfield and said that Plimmer had
ruined his daughter is left unconsoled and unac-
counted for. An Irish girl is inserted in the story
for no visible purpose save to shake hands re-
peatedly with the hero and say she believes in his
innocence, and an oppressive Irishman comes on
and remarks, for no reason known to anybody,
that he had done two murders. Then the heavy
parent falls on him down some steps and reduces
him to a mass of shrieks and squashed brogue.
Misses Harrie Ireland and Fitzmaurice Gill are the
most interesting features of the “Sin in fact,
the latter lady, who has improved very much
within the last year or two, is probably the best
character in a tale which is about as coherent
as the bi-metallic problem struck by lightening.
Cecil Ward is apparently staggered by tne mixed
nature of the situation, and takes it in a perfunc-
tory spirit. Plimmer takes it seriously, so far
as it will let him, and Westmacott takes it any-
how. The best thing that could happen to the
“ Mother’s Sin ” would be for a cheap tree that
isn’t otherwise employed to fall upon it straight-
away. The management apparently lost con-
fidence in it the second night, and “Shall We
Forgive Her ” is announced for Saturday.
*« # *
“Miss Brown” still holds her own at
Sydney Cri., and looks capable of great feats of
further endurance. At the same time, though
business is good, it isn’t so good as the show de-
serves. After much problem play in which the
female with a Past is bathed in woe in the pre-
sence of much expensive furniture, and much
drama wherein the girl who has sinned wanders
belated along midnight roads in the rain and talks
to the dripping trees about her honor, “ Brown”
is a blessed oasis—to be taken occasionally on an
empty stomach. As a constant affair it might
grow stale, but “Brown” now and then is un-
alloyed pleasure and restfulness. There is peace
in the smile of the dusky girl from Demerara, and
the battered German music-master is repose for
the soul, and there is no exhausting mental problem
involved in the recapture of Miss Brown by the
muddy policeman, save the problem of how her
hair didn’t get lost in the combat. It is only
necessary to accept the fact that Miss Brown has
evidently been trailed along on her back for a
mile or two of heavy road, and thrown into the
select bosom of the academy once more. There is
no reason to fear that someone will come in just
here and prove to be Miss Brown’s unlawful
infant previously abandoned on a doorstep, and
the absence of any unlawful infant is a valuable
circumstance. Barring the fact that the piece in-
culcates a certain disrespect for the police —and as
no one could be otherwise than disrespectful to
such a policeman that hardly matters—there is no
moral in it at all, unless it be the moral that a
woman’s pocket is a very ridiculous orifice in the
back of her skirt; and it is a blessed thing to get
away from morals. Also, it is a blessed thing to
get away from many other things.

Harry Rickards’ two Sydney theatres
dance buoyantly on the top wave of prosperity.
Chirgwin is putting in the last fortnight of nis
Sydney season at the Palace, and, to counter-
balance him, John Coleman sheds the light of his
countenance on the Tivoli. The latter, having
also Alice Leamar and the clever Wilton ana
Stack, is perhaps rather the stronger show of the
two just now, but somebody will doubtless be
hustled round presently to restore the balance.

The great “ Matsa,” as previously an-
nounced, opens at Her Majesty’s on Saturday.
The cast includes Misses Florence Young, Juliet
Wray, Mav Pollard, Marietta Nash, Maic Saqui,
Ivy Scott and Carrie Moore, also Lauri, Knowles,
Howard Vernon, Little Gulliver, and many other
people, including a blizzard of legs. The legs
bring a most flattering testimonial from their last
situation in Melbourne, and great things are ex-
pected of them.

Sydney Lyceum, which has been closed
since the sudden downfall of the worst Irish
drama on earth, re-opens on March 6. The new
lessee is that favorite actor, Henry Bracy, and his
season begins with the “ Beggar Student.” A
strong co. will warble its best in this fine old
opera, which hasn’t been seen on the Sydney stage
since a period so remote that the memory of man
gets bogged in looking for the date amid the gloom
of antiquity.
** * *
Sydney Opera House awakens from the
dead on Saturday, when a new co. and a new
opera will be on deck. The latter is by August
W. Juncker, and is called the “ Romance of Cor-
sica,” and the co. consists, in part at least, of
Miss Anna Paterson, a prima-donna allegedly of
much beauty and talent, who is reported to have
done good work elsewhere, in some locality with
which this paper isn’t fully acquainted.

James MacMahon reports that, up to date,
120,000 people have called in at his Cinemato-
graphe, and seen the skirt-dancing girl, and gone
away refreshed in mind to hustle for a crust with
renewed vigor. The statement doesn’t seem im-
probable ; anyhow, the show is good enough to
deserve to be seen by twice that number. The
“Cin.” came to Sydney as a passing show, that
was ready to move on at any moment, but it has
now settled down into a permanent institution,
and taken root, and J. MacMahon will apparently
stay on and grow a corporation, and, in course of
time, become a solid old right-thinking person and
a K.C.M.G.
** * *
Brough’s latest purchase, “ A White Ele-
phant,” was tried at Melb. Bijou on Saturday,
and found rather wanting. The “Elephant” is a
thin, farcical comedy of errors, that spring from
impossible circumstances and terminate in a simple
all-round explanation at 1 .30. If the lapses be-
tween acts were not painfully long, the cur-
tain would fall 20 minutes earlier. Mrs. Brough,
who comes of a noble family of idiots, is married
to a tea-broker as foolish as herself ; also the tea-
broker’s relatives are deficient in intellect and
behave accordingly. Two pairs of elopers slink
away to London after dark, and Mrs. Brough
slinks likewise, attended by a male cousin, the
cousin being somehow persuaded that she is elop-
ing with a diminutive cad. The tea-broker,
attended by a broken-kneed earl, follows his wife.
Finally 10 people come, in detachments, to the
tea-broker’s London residence where a low-spirited
housekeeper bemoans their unreasonable demands
for bed and bacon at a time when all the furniture
is h’up h’on h’end. Everybody being assembled
and met together, the misunderstandings vanish,
and Mrs. Brough mentions that she is “A White
Elephant,” in order that the title of the comedy
may seem to be fairly accounted for.
« •' * •
The dialogue is bright, and some of the
character sketches amusing. Miss Watt Tanner,
as a dilapidated old housekeeper in a grey shawl,
and Harry Roberts, as the nobleman who has
gone wrong at the kneecaps, are neat bits of
humor. Mrs. Brough is light and bright, likewise
Ferris ; whereas Ralph Roberts, as the little cad,
seems much too aggressive. Brough’s tea-broker
reminds one of several previous middle-aged hus-
bands by the same oomedian—middle-aged hus-
bands, when you come to think of it, are much
afflicted with sameness - and Carey gives a
forcible delineation of gout in the big-toe. The
“ Elephant ” will gambol for six nights only.

On Saturday the clever co. appears in “ A
Woman’s Reason,” which arrives with excellent
credentials from Sydney.

“ The Derby Winner,” at the Royal, has
settled down to a triumphant career. All the
dramas produced by Bland Holt nowadays are
after the multitude’s own heart, but this orthodox
narrative of the foiled majah and the fiery steed
appears to suit the multitude better than usual.
The majah’s designs upon Walter Baker’s wife
excite much human interest, and the reconciliation
of that injured lady with the husband she ran
away from is such a popular event that The
Bulletin begins to suspect all married women
of a desire to flee the domestic circle for
the sake of some mutual forgiveness when
they return. The fair sexes are undoubtedly
whales for mutual forgiveness. They pre-
fer it to a new bonnet. Last week’s admira-
tion for 13 changes of scenery in “ The Derby
Winner ” is herewith carried forward until further
notice ; also, there is a good word due to several
performers who do nothing in particular without
o-ivinir offence The principal horse conies under

Melbourne has not yet made up its mind
concerning “ Prisoner of Zenda,” at the Princess s.
The verdict of the first-nighters was not very
favorable, judging from poor attendances on the
Monday and Tuesday, but towards the end
last week business recovered from its undue de-
pression, and Anthony Hope’s
to catch-on. Princess Flavia (Miss Ada Ferrar)
makes love to her sham-monarch in a voice that
warms the house. It is the wooing of a P lur IP-
passionate virgin, who, having unexpectedly dis-
covered her other self, would fain hug the gentle-
man, to make sure that he isn’t a dream. When
she cries “Rudolph!” music fills the air, and
marriage doesn’t seem a failure and the weary
journalist becomes conscious of his soul beating
against his ribs, as though that immortal entity
was trying to get out to find its mate.
' * * * ,
These love episodes infuse a sense ot
sincerity into the rest of the plays which ot er-
wise would be hopelessly unreal. Nobody off the
stage can take Ruritania and its ruling powers at
all seriously, except whilst Princess Jblavia is
throwing her ripe affections at His Majesty s
head, or Antoinette de Mauban (Miss I age) is
wasting her sweetness upon a saturnine Duke
Michael. The men, left to themselves, are
masqueraders. They have no dramatic life apart
from the female element as represented by the
two ladies aforesaid. As for the female sassiety ele-
ment in the coronation scene (so-called) it is nothing,
or worse than nothing, to the play. The fashion-
able supers, walking on, one at a time, like dress-
makers’ models, may be said to kill the coronation
idea. If the maid-of-honour (or whatever she may
be) with the pink-and-white skirt be a specimen of
Ruritanian court deportment, The Bulletin
votes for the immediate withdrawal of British
Ambassador Atholwood from Strelsau. Her
walk is, in a manner of speaking, an insult to the
Ambassador.

The Delevines and Sisters Winterton—
late of the busted Goatcher co. are new-
comers at Melb. Opera House. Charles Godfrey
still occupies the centre of the bill, but the Vaidis
Sisters have just gone for ever., and Crackles like-
wise is departing for ever, or not so long. This
gives an opportunity for the inevitable somebody
else to fill the aching void and get received with
extraordinary enthusiasm.

ette, matches, weighing and other machines with

Dear Bulletin,— Why buck so against the
Queensland P.O. regulations? They were merely
framed to be protective of local newspapers (bar-
ring the gambling folly—l don’t attempt to excuse
that). Now the Q. P.O. merely charges outside
papers value for services rendered —the very thing
you advocate with respect to Sydney dailies.
Formerly, papers from other provinces were
received in Q. free of postage. Local agents were
badly handicapped. For instance : A subscriber
to the Review of Reviews could get his paper
from Melbourne direct for about 9s ; whereas he
couldn’t get it from (say) Gordon and Gotch
under 10s. 6d. Result: Papers were ordered
direct, and Q. P.O. carried loads for nothing.
Many of these alleged newspapers were advts.
pure and simple, with a few colorable news-pars,
or jokes thrown in. . . . Touching gambling-
advts. The Q. Govt, has taken legal opinion as
to whether it can come down on a vendor (in shop
or street) who-sells a paper containing either gam-
bling or legally- 11 obscene ” advts., once the P.O.
has passed such paper through. Answer :“No ! ”
... Q. P.O. Act provides that a penalty of ill
for every copy issued can be inflicted on news-
papers that publish supplements containing
printed matter that has not been set up in Q., or-
is not from a stereo, the original type for which
was set up in Q. But these supplements are to be
seen broadcast in the land. The matrix or the
stereo is imported, and the Customs officials say
that they can’t stop them from being received so
long as, the duty is paid. Why don’t the
“great ” (!) dailies protest and bring about a pro-
secution ? Because the “ great ” (!) dailies use
imported stereo’s, themselves largely and daily—
though not as alleged supplements.—Ux.

Four Federal Tickets.
As the natural result of Cardinal Moran’s Federal
candidature, a congress of heated Protestant
parsons met last Monday in Sydney, and selected
a “ Protestant bunch ” to run against the great
R.C. potentate. There were about 150 infuriated
Protestants on the job, and they were a spectacle
to make any decent Federationist weep. The
chairman and boss Protestant announced that
“ the sole test of a candidate for a place on the
list of the Federal ten should be ‘ Is he a candi-
date who was likely to have been elected if the
Cardinal had not entered the Contest?’” The
object of the meeting, as thus cold-bloodedly set
forth by the boss cleric, was to pick out the ten
men apart from Mr. Moran who would
get the biggest vote anyhow, and by giving
an extra whoop to their interest to get
them a few more votes—enough to wipe
out Mr. Moran altogether. Not one wild-
eyed Stiggins of them all had one word to say
about tlie fitness of the candidates to build a
Federal Constitution, or about their Federal
opinions, or their sincerity, or their political
record. The ten who were thrown together re-
present half-a-dozen diverse ideas, and if they get
in they are eminently calculated to bring matters
to a dead-lock. The parsons, however, by their
own showing, didn’t care a straw for Federation,
or the Australian nation that may be; they were
openly and brutally selfish and unpatriotic;
their one idea was to chuck-out their alleged
fellow-Christian —the man in the long red rags
and the giddy head-gear—on his ear, even
if the Federal movement was sacrificed
to the banging of their own twopenny cymbal
and the shriek of their sectarian tin-horn.
Even if the ten selected are by no means
the worst that might be put up, the Conference
can claim no credit on that account; there still
remains the chairman’s assurance that they were
not chosen for that reason or for anything dimly
resembling it, but solely because they were the 10
most likely to bounce Patrick Francis Moran out
of the Convention. The meeting didn’t disguise
its mean little motive in the least; to all appear-
ance it was actually proud of it. And, finally,
preacher Carruthers, having helped to shove his
brother on to the list, announced that the “ Lord
of Hosts ” would be with them in their attempt
to sacrifice their country, if need be, for the sake
of “ chucking out ” the rival ecclesiastic, and it
was agreed that everybody should pray that
wisdom might be bestowed on the candidates,
and that the Lord would be pleased to shovel
brains into amiable, flabby old James Brun-
ker, and to make W. M’Millan a bright
and shining light. The idea of the Deity inserting
political brains into James Nixon Brunker is one
that only Jos. Symes in his most profane mood
could do justice to, and Jos. Symes would pro-
bably treat it, with illustrations, in a way that
would get him three months. There are now four
complete Federal tickets before the N.S.W. elec-
tors—the Labor ticket, the Orange ticket, the
Protestant ditto, and the one offered by The Bul-
letin and published in this issue. And this paper
can assert with confidence that of them all its own
is the only one which goes on no sectarian or
party lines whatever—which doesn’t sacrifice
the great national cause to tariff questions
or political factions or the private rows
of churches and sects, or to local interests
or local prejudices, and which is based solely on a
desire to make the Federation as complete and
effective as may be. It even leaves out R. E.
O’Connor, one of the ablest and most honest men
of its own fiscal faith, because he votes strongly
for keeping the railways under provincial control,
and would thus make the proposed union incom-
plete on a most vital point; and it includes
the shuffling and unstable Reid, because it be-
lieves that owing to his political position
the chances of getting Federation are a shade
better with him than without him. Of the other
three tickets two have no basis at all, save the
desire to keep Cardinal Moran from being 2 per
cent, of the deliberative power of the Convention.
And as that dismally ordinary person will almost
certainly be shunted into the background on the
instant and kept there, when he runs up against
men of the calibre of Barton, Turner, Isaacs,
Kingston and Cordon, the question whether he is
in the Convention or out of it—except in so far
that, if he is in, a better man must be left out—
doesn’t amount to two-penn’orth of coppers after
all.
Premier Turner, since his knightly dub-
bing, seems to have lost even his sense of the
ludicrous. Last Thursday the evening Herald
notified that he was to visit Gov. Brassey and talk
about Queen Vic.’s invitation to England ; and—
It is understood that his Excellency will use strong
arguments in favor of Sir George accepting, and that, as
a result, a favorable reply will be forwarded to the Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies.
Can anything be imagined sillier than Turner
sitting solemnly listening to Brassey’s he—hum—
harguments, whilst all the time he had made up
his mind that he was going to London ? It really
appears that when a man so far loses his self-
respect as to accept a title he becomes ridiculous
enough for anything. But p’r’aps it’s only the
ridiculous Herald.

The Wild-Cut Column .
Last Tuesday it was announced quite unex-
pectedly that Westralia is corning into the Federal Con-
vention, after all. This absolutely shuts down on the
scheme advocated bj’ Carruthers and endorsed by various
other candidates, by which the Commonwealth is to take
over the railways at 25 years’ purchase, so that, at pre-
sent results, they would pay 4 per cent, on the purchase
money. Under this scheme the N.S.W. lines would be
bought at about £5,000,000 below cost; those of Victoria
at £15,000,000 below cost; while S.A. would sell out at a
loss of £2,500,000, and Tasmania at a loss of about
£3,000,000. All this would be very pleasant for the Com-
monwealth Treasury, but when the same process involved
taking over the Westralian lines at three times their cost,
because the bubble boom has rushed up the earnings for
the moment to an unprecedented figure, the impracticable
character of the scheme becomes apparent. No one sup-
poses that the W.A. boom will last at its present high
pressure, yet if present earnings are to be taken as the
criterion in one case they must be in all, and the adhesion
of Westralia shows the weak point of Carruthers’ great
idea.

The City Mutual Life Assurance Society
(Sydney) presents a much improved balance-sheet. The
total premium income for ’96 was £31,858, against £29,179
for 1895, and £27,775 for 1894. Interest on investments is
£7431 against £7670 and £6243 for two previous years.
The total income is a little over £39,000, and of this over
£13,000 is added to the funds, which now stand at
£144,999. Also, what is most important of all, the very
heavy expense-rate begins to show a decline. For the
last three years the City Mutual has spent 36 and a
fraction per cent, of its premiums on working ex.’s,
whereas this year it spends barely 31 per cent. It has
still the worst expense rate of all the mutual life offices
of Australia, but it isn’t nearly so far ahead of the next
worst offender as it used to be. Among the assets “ Pro-
perties acquired by Foreclosure, £4235,” is exactly the
same as last year, and as this item always means possible
loss it is satisfactory to see that it is comparatively small
and is getting no worse. A sum of £2557 is written off
for depreciation, which looks a wise precaution, and the
“ Claim Contingent Reserve ” of £lOOO has disappeared,
which is not quite so wise. The only dubious-looking
asset is “Deferred Instalments of Annual Premiums,
£7518 an unsaleable and intangible asset which
isn’t cash or money invested or anything else, save
the society s. right to collect that amount from the policy-
holders if it can get the money. Also, one objec-
tionable feature is that the City Mutual never includes
accrued or outstanding interest among its assets, and as
it is impossible to suppose these items are quite non-
existent, it seems probable that they are lumped in with
the advances.
The City Mutual is a vigorous, hustling office
with a future before it—what kind of future this paper
wouldn’t like to say. At age 40 it will give, for £lOO, an
annuity of £7 10s. where the A.M.P. only ventures to
offer £6 4s. Its whole-life premium with profits at age 40
is £2 18s. per £lOO where the A.M.P. charges £3 4s. 5d.,
and the Colonial Mutual —an office celebrated for its low
rates—£3 os. 9d. The City, having a higher expense rate
than either of these, should, on the face of thing's, require
a higher rate to keep it going with absolute safety,
instead of a much lower one. It offers, without any extra
charge, to hold the amount of a policy in trust for a lono-
term of years after the insured’s death, and pay the bene*
ficiary 5 per cent, interest on the money in the interval.
A policy effected now under this clause may fall in 35
years hence, and the money may be left in trust for 20
years longer, and an office that commits itself, without any
extra consideration to cover the additional risk, to pay 5
per cent, half-a-century hence, at which time, for all that
is known to the contrary, interest rates may have fallen
so low that it can’t earn 3 percent., is plunging pretty
heavily. No other office that The Bulletin knows of
takes such a risk, or damns the consequences so cheer-
fully. Even now, when the City earns about £5 Bs. per
cent., it is doubtful if it can cover management expenses
and losses by depreciation, etc., and yet realise the
5 per cent, net which it pays away so gaily. Then
it issues tontine policies by which a person aged
between 20 and 30 (average age, 25) is estimated, in
return for certain payments, to have £1950 to draw at the
end of 20 years (average age, 45). For this sum it offers
him a life annuity of £l6O a year, which annuity, by its
own tables, the very cheapest tables in Australasia—is
worth £2025. Also, its annuity tables and its ordinary
tables clash considerably. At age 43, a single payment of
£lOO will buy a paid-up policy (with profits) for £2Ol.
The same £lOO will buy an annuity of £7 14s. 7d., and the
£7 14s. 7d. will pay the annual premium, under the same
life table, on a policy of £239. A man with £lOOO to in-
vest could get £3BO worth of insurance out of the City
Mutual for nothing by approaching it in this circuitous
fashion. The vigor and energy and progressive character
of the City Mutual are beyond question, but it seems to
take a good many risks in its desire to keep moving, and
some of them will come home to roost in a disastrous
fashion long after the rains have begun to patter on the
little green grave r'f.the man now in charge.

M'Cracken’s City Brewery (Melbourne), pro-
bably the saddest beer enterprise in this hemisphere,
talks of reconstructing. The balance-sheet shows a loss
for 1896 of £90,874, against a loss of £22,923 for 1895,
£9983 lost for 1894, and £4636 lost for 1893. The gross
profits for ’96 are a little over £62,000, and the working
expenses alone are nearly £76,000. Debenture interest
(£22,500) is therefore all loss, and the rest of the damage
is made up of £55,000 written off for depreciation on
hotels, &c. This great inflated brewery has £500,000
paid-up capital, and it proposes to write off £250,000 as
lost. Considering that there is already a debit balance of
£124,000 and £21,000 of preliminary expenses yet unpaid,
this only leaves £105,000 available to cover depreciation
in the paper value of the securities, and as thej’ consist
mostly of £900,000 worth of hotels and freeholds which
are still put in at their original boom cost, it is probable
that £600,000 would be none too much to write off instead
of £250,000. And even if six millions were written off it
wouldn’t make the income any nearer to the expenditure.
An appeal is being made to the debenture-holders to
reduce interest on their £500,000 worth of securities
from 4)4 per cent, to something more reasonable, but
even supposing they reduced it to 1 per cent, it wouldn’t
stop the drift in a concern where income doesn’t even cover
working expenses. M'Cracken’s Brewery Co. seems to
have pawned everything to keep itself afloat. Freehold
properties and hotels (valued in the balance-sheet at
£150,000), are mortgaged for £lOl,OOO. The uncalled
capital (£500,000) and other properties (£750,000) are
pawned to the debenture-holders, and they have also a
general lien over everything else that isn’t specifically up
the spout to other creditors. Customers’ bills-of-sale are
pledged to the National Bank as security for the over-
draft. The great tanglefoot concern seems to be hope-
lessly mortgaged, and it doesn’t look as if the assets,
supposing they were sold up, would anything like cover
liabilities. Also, it doesn’t look as if any reconstruction
could do it much good as things are at present. The only
hope is that the beer business may look up, but, though
various other things are looking up, beer seems to be im-
moveable. By the way, part of the assets consist of
“goodwill”—value not stated, it being lumped in with
the £750,000 item. “ Goodwill,” in a concern that doesn’t
pay working expenses, is a distinctly humorous item.

Premier Forrest, of Westralia, says there is no
truth in' the statement that the Government has aban-
doned the 2£ million Coolgardie water scheme ; the
present time is inopportune for raising a loan, that is ail.
Vi* cult y w hieh the W.A. Land Co. had in selling' its
*1,100,000 worth of Westralian Government stock even at
a big discount is probably what is the matter. If that
small lot was received with so little enthusiasm, the offer
of three millions or so would probably burst the market,
and, the failure would burst the W.A. boom. Yet if loans
can tbe floated the boom has got to burst. It is a very
big, top-heavy boom tottering on the sharp pinnacle of
nothing in particular, and it is liable to come down
wallop at any moment. If it is left alone, it must come
down, yet the attempt to shore it up may only knock it
over. '

. Maoriland revenue for 1896 was £4,602,000—an
increase of £351,000 on the figures for 1895. There is an
increase of £lOO,OOO in railways, £7OOO in land-tax, and
£3OOO in income-tax. Among the six provinces which
have no boom on hand and are travelling' solely on their
merits, Maoriland shows about the best results for the
year. And considering that the province is living under
a policy of State Socialism and Protection, both of which
are said to be wholly “ ruinous,” the result isn t so bad.

Adelaide has 33 fire insurance offices, and of
these only one moderate-sized affair, the South Australian
Co., is a local institution. Therefore, the local democratic
paper, Quiz, begins to agitate for a State Fire Insurance
Department and compulsory insurance, in order to save
the profits which now go out of the country to help pay
dividends to the shareholders of these other 32 offices.
When Maoriland leads the way, as usual, and proves the
feasibility of State fire insurance, the other provinces will
follow.

furniture account it is £l7O to the good. The co. has
now been nine years in existence, and has accumulated a
reserve of just £750 and has £1284 to credit of profit and
loss. A cold-blooded public doesn’t seem to take this
baby concern very seriously, and its shares, 10s. paid-up,
fetch about 7s. 6d. Still, there seems to be nothing the
matter with it, excepting its remarkable smallness.

New York Life Insurance Co. reports that it
issued, in 1896, 53,000 odd policies, insuring £24,700,000.
The insurances effected in the U.S. were £2,000,000 more
than for any previous year ; £2,000,000 was paid in death
losses, and about the same amount to living members,
whose policies matured ; and £600,000 has been lent
to members on the security of their policies, at the very
moderate rate of 5 per cent. Also, £400,000 cash has been
distributed in profits to policy-holders. The New York
Life is a gigantic concern of good repute, which is com-
paratively little known in Sydney, probably because the
local office is in a back street, up a stair. If it had a huge
stone building of its own on a prominent corner things
would doubtless be different.

The utter rottenness of the Victorian bank-
ruptcy law, under which any man of straw eould be a
trustee in insolvency if he could only get a majority of
creditors to appoint him—possibly bogus creditors put on
the schedule by his friend, the insolvent, for the express
purpose of appointing him —keeps asserting itself persis-
tently. The latest trouble concerns a trustee who was
charged with selling to friends of his own property in an
insolvent estate worth £l7ll for £l5, and property worth
£l7OO for £5, and with keeping the £2O thus received for
his own use. Also he was charged with receiving “ tips”
from the buyers, and not accounting for the assets gener-
ally, and with being drunk. As he didn’t turn up to
refute these allegations he was removed from his position,
but as he had allegedly removed himself from his posi-
tion and also removed the estate—he had, it would appear,
been removing the latter for eight years before the law
got on his tracks—the penalty doesn't amount to much.
It only means that he can’t fool with this particular
estate any longer, but the chances are that the remains
of it are not worth holding on to by this time.

S.A. State Land Bank is making advances now

too fast and reckless, and is rushing down a steep place to

Ed. Bulletin, —In N.S.W. there was created
by the Real Property Act of 1862 (Torrens’ Act) an assur-
ance fund to guarantee holders of property against loss,
should it be afterwards found out that the title to any
property brought under the Act was bad. This fund now
amounts to about £150,000, representing the contributions
of property-holders for over 30 years. Where is this
fund? Is it simply part of the general liability of the
N.S.W. Government? And is it not grossly insufficient
for its purpose? If the title to one city property of any
size were found to be bad, the compensation payable to
the evicted owner might about swamp the fund. The
contribution—Jd. in the £ of declared value when land
is brought under the Act, and on death of registered
owner—is manifestly too small for protection.—P.

There was a mad gamble under the Q. land-
balloting system for the rich Colintoun lands in Ipswich
district. Taking 10 acres, the applications (and each
batch nearly all entered and paid for by one man, gener-
ally calling himself an “ agent” 1) numbered—39, 34 , 33,
35, 34, 20, 32, 20, 23 and 27. Probably not more than 10
bona-fides in the whole lot. The euphonious term for this
sort of attempted dummying is “ dasher ” applications.
The scandal has got so noisy, the swindle is so undis-
guised (and perfectly within the letter of the law), that
the land-court has put its nose boldly to the stink, and
cheerful confessions are the order of the day.
An explanation of the recent sharp rise in B.H.
Proprietary stock, in which others have sympathetically
joined, is the reported increase in the quantity of gold.
It has to be remembered that whereas now the co. is re-
fining its dor# bullion, thus showing a higher gold output,
formerly it sent this bullion “ home,” where, of course, it
commanded a price proportionate to the quantity of gold
contents ; but the extra price got by reason of these con-
tents was not shown separately. Nevertheless there has
been an improvement, but by no means sufficient to justify
any rapid rise of several shillings a share.

who start by saying : “ As requested, we have examined

that the English-owned Taylor s Reward mine, N.S.W.,

IOOOoz. Since then a second crushing for over 1600 oz. has
been announced. These returns were supposed to be
accurate, although it was admitted that the management
kept things as quiet as possible. From London papers it is
now ascertained that the first crushing was 400 tons for
7090 z. What the second really was time will tell. Had
the published return been as much lower as it was above
the actual return probably the secrecy of the manage-
ment would not have allowed it to go uncontradicted.

failure to float on a £200,000 basis is probably a good

W.A. Development Corporation meeting in
London last month “ passed off well ” owing to the pre-
sence of Frank Nicolas, M.1.M.E., who made a fine speech
admitting some failures, but predicting great success
from some of the co.’s Westralian mines. The man who
can travel from W.A. to London without having a good
speech ready by the time he gets there is not lip to his
business. The writer trusts his predictions will be more
accurate than some of his alleged statements. He said
there was “ a tremendous difference between milling at
one’s own mill and milling at another man’s. In one case
it was the interest of the mill-owner to leave as much as
possible in the tailings, which were his own property.”
Sheer rot. Some of the biggest mines of Charters Towers
and Bendigo to-day never had mills, and have no inten-
tion of getting them. It is only when the tailings are
mixed with others they become the property of the mill-
owner. Again: “This water is salt, but that does not
make much difference to milling.” It makes a great deal
of difference in most cases. The meeting was described
as “the oasis of Westralian despondency,” and the co.
has been congratulated in the possession of such an
expert. Alas!

A well-informed Bulletin correspondent
Auckland (M.L.) mining-market has been flattened out
for the last three months. The falling due of many calls
has slackened the nerves of local syndicators. The old
chap with the long head can now pick up from the long-
eared fellow scrip which in April will be trebled in value.
Hundreds of co s with scant capital are hanging on in the
hope that Bull will pull them out. However, the bottom
has not dropped out of the boom. In March or April
paper-inining vvill probably be as lively as ever on Auck-
land Exchange which, by the way, now has two lady
brokers. J
The Coromandel Peninsula for over 100 miles
from Cape Colville to the Bay of Plenty, is being worked
by local and English eo’s. Bull has been represented by
smart experts—many of them natives of the place—who
have so well nursed his interests that he has got the best
mines cheap. Any old-time ground of repute can easily
be floated in London, but new properties must show
proofs of bonafides— large reefs being the main point.
The mines need extensive operations, and the ore, as a
rule, has to be put through expensive processes, so stronar
oo’s are a necessity. The drawback is that divs. go out of
the country. B
Two co’s, holding tens of thousands of acres of
free and leasehold purchased from the Kauri Timber Co.
have swarms of prospectors out—some opening ground in
the ordinary way ; others with pestle-and-mortar fossick-
ing for something new. A great extent of heavy bush
has been burnt, off bringing to light outcrops in abun-
dance. The powerful Exploration Co., capital £2,000,000
operates at Tairua, Puriri, and Whenukite; the Kauri
Estates Co., capita! 1500,000, at Whangapoua, Mercury
Bay, and Kauaeranga. The former co. encourages private
prospectors, and allows them cash or cash plus shares for
new finds ; the latter pays its men 9s. and 10s. per day
the 9s. men getting a small share in the ground. This
activity is occasioned by the passing of the Minim- Bill
which comes into force in Feb.—the resumption clauses
of which have given absentee landholders an ugly scare.
It looks as if for some years there will be plenty work for
miners men capable of managing being especially
wanted. Miners get Bs. a day, and camp-life has few
evils, the climate being good, and wood and water
abundant.
At Thames, Coromandel and Oapu the good
stone is blue, showing geld worth £3 per oz. or there-
abouts. The patches are jewellers’-shops, but the inter-
vals between ’em are wider than a church-door. The sur-
face of Thames is honeycombed, but a strong Bull co as-
sisted by King Seddon, is putting down a deep-sinker on
the Queen of Beauty Elat, and, if the water of the Gulf
does not burst up the show, something rare should be got.
Coromandel at present is a one-mine diggings- the
Hauraki ; close by are Bunker’s, Hauraki North, Welcome
Lind, and Kathleen—very promising, the Hauraki North
and Find being on specimens, but not enough for divs.
For the rest, muni’s the word. Adamantine country and
pa.tchiness verging on eccentricity are Tapu’s pet" hold.
Adjacent is Gentle Annie Creek—a branch of the Mata
river—the only spot on the peninsula where alluvial has
been found. Years ago about 400 oz. were taken off the
bed-rock, some of the nuggets being as large as a man’s
thumb. The creek is now being overhauled from end to
end,
Ohinemuri, Te Aroha, and Puru possess white
or grey quartz in huge reefs, in some places amounting to
precipices. Through the stone run blue-black bands
which contain the bullion. Old-style miners passed bv,
and even still pass by, with the snort of ignorance, ore of
this stamp. Ihe YVaihi, Woodstock, Waitekauri, Waihi-
Silverton, Crown, and Talisman are noble properties and
have made the Ohinemuri the foremost mining area in
M.L. The district was practically abandoned for 10 veara
“ because the gold did not show in the stone.” The ore
which, under old conditions, went at the rate of I2s. per
ton, now yields by eyaniding from 43 to £5 per ton. This
is the most stable part of the fields, and here English money
is chiefly invested. The Tc Aroha stone is associated
with lead, iron, sulphur, and sometimes cinnabar ; being
so base the stuff is hard to treat. The reefs are miles in
length—and large operations are going on.
Puru, a new place, has enormous blows of
quartz which has yielded fine assays on a large scale—the
rock is refractory and needs complicated treatment. At
Tairua, on the east of the peninsula at the base of the
tall “Pinnacles,” is the Broken Hill mine, run “ regard-
less” by Jonathan Charles Billing Pockeradge Seaver,
late of Sydney. Extensive plant going up, crowds of
men' employed, cash lashed about ad lib. If it don’t
turn up trumps ? Oh, well. A trial of 18M>cwt. yielded
at the rate of 180 per ton. As it is a Bull co. little news
leaks out. First crushing will probably prove this “ big
thing.” The portions of the peninsula which promise
permanency are those needing extensive workings, large
plants and scientific treatment.

The fleet did big “biz.” when visiting
Hobart lately. They gave a large dance and had
a hired ferry steamer without any lights to speak
of moored next the flag-ship as a sitting-out
saloon. When the different girls’ dances came on
few of them could be found. The local johnnies
were much enraged because they weren’t invited
to the “ shivoo,” and were still more furious at the
sitting-out episode—which they only heard of.

The surveying-ships of the fleet were put
on work by the Admiral down at Hobart. The
consequence was that sundry infuriated officer-

hot water. Nothing but humbly-expressed con-

Torres Straits to survey shoals. “Leaving off
work to carry bricks ” does not seem to please
them. They prefer strawberries and cream, and a
sitting-out saloon in the dark.

other man said so; (4) He knew Lee Weller but

The alleged interview which Card. Moran
gave to the Sydney D.T. reporter was certainly an
amusing affair. On the day following the L.O.L.

candidature, the latter’s house was assailed by
reporters anxious for copy, but a satellite informed
all and sundry that the gentleman from Kilkenny
-was not taking any. Late in the evening, how-
ever, a statement was supplied to the Telegraph,
and was duly published in the form of an inter-
view—the funniest part of which was the Cardi-
nal’s description of the always greasy and sneak-
fully - cautious S.M. Herald as a “violent”
paper—to which the boycott should be applied by
all friends of liberty. The action of the Cardinal
in thus making the D.T. his mouthpiece was, of
course, a great stroke of business for that paper,
and the affair so paralysed the easily-frightened
Herald that, though for some time previously it
had been publishing loads of anti-Moran, on the

direct or indirect, to Patrick Francis Card,

hospital in 1896 than in ’95, there were 38 fewer
deaths, and the supporters of the new doctors say
that this improvement is owing to the removal of
the old, clumsy crowd of sawboneses, and hint

South Brisbane (Q.) runs rings round North
Brisbane in municipal development. While the
latter couldn’t elect a Mayor in a fortnight, the
former is bringing to completion schemes of
electric trams, a municipal library, a public fish-

At a Brisbane (Q.) draper’s, and at a boot-
shop, any purchasing customer is supplied (if he
chooses) with a free cup of tea and some bread and
butter, or a sandwich. The patrons of this
arrangement are mostly women. Now, if an
enterprising tradesman would only start dis-
pensing free whisky to each buyer of a shillings-
worth, how the bold, bad men of Brisbane would,
roll up ! There’s a pile in the idea for the busi-
ness-man who knows how to provide a sufficient
margin of profit to permit the innovation.

of titles is a living and strict enactment, and
though, as in the case mentioned, courtesy counts
for something, still if the wife of a K.C.M.G.
demands the title as a right a troublesome person
may compel him to pay at least the costs of the
prosecution. Verb. sap. to the K.C.M.Gs. bound,

A few months ago, when one'
“ Professor ” Davis was tried in Mel-
bourne on a charge of ignorantly
slaughtering a woman whom he had
treated in his own peculiar fashion
for cancer, a lady witness swore for
the defence that the “ Professor ” had
marvellously cured her of the same
complaint after the medical profession
had failed to give any relief. That
witness died the other day from can-
cer —the same old cancer—which
recurred almost as soon as she was
fully recovered. Most miraculous
doings end the same way sooner or
later. One well-known case is that of
an Australian politician who left for a
brighter sphere a few years ago. He
was absolutely cured, by a certain
patent medicine, of an incurable
disease just a few days before he died,
and in his delight he gave an eloquent
testimonial to that effect. It was
advertised in large type everywhere,
and a week later the cured politician,
pegged out from the same complaint.
Then the advt. was withdrawn—in
Australia, at all events; though it
may still be doing good service in
other countries where the old man’s
death isn’t known.

The public-prayer system was

Miss Yvonne Leverrier, probably the most
talented Australian pianist of the rising genera-

Miss Leverrier first attracted attention as soloist
at Prof. Marshall Hall’s orchestral concerts, when,
her success was so marked that she was imme-
diately engaged by Melb. Liedertafel. Herr
Kretschmann introduced the brilliant young
player at Sydney Town Hall last year, but,
strangely enough, she has not yet appeared with
any of the leading societies of her own city. Fail-
ing any such opportunity, Miss Leverrier will
give a farewell recital before she sails —probably
by the German liner Barbarossa. On reaching
Vienna Miss Leverrier will study under Lesche-

A wail from Riverina :
Dear Bulletin, —I saw an “identification” in Wagga
lately. The police arrested a man for house-breaking' and
robbery. There was positively no evidence against him.
Ranged up so that the only witness could spot him, the
farce of fairness consisted in showing him up, ragged and
dirty from the cells, in company with a lawyer, a store-
keeper and two policemen, all known to the “ lydy ” pro-
secutor, sister of a stock and station agent. I ask you, is
it feasible that she did not know the limbs of the law ?
Or the lock-up-keeper, although he disguised himself in a
brown coat over his blue pants and polished boots ? Then
the grave charge of being in the same street as the rob-
bery was adduced against him. Remanded eight days.
No appearance then of the witness. Remanded again
two days. Then discharged. No compensation and no
iredress. The same day a prisoner wanted to see a lawyer
who came to him in the dock. The only evidence against
the accused was (say) Constable Ginger Mick, in charge of
the case. This official stepped forward and said he must
bear all the conversation ! And the P. M. refused to state
whether that was right or not. I was the prisoner. Any-
way, the beak has now been retired. Long live the Public
Service Board ! —S.W.

and peacefully dropped
out of sight. One night
not long since, however,
she recalled herself to
memory by arriving on her
hands and knees at a
farm-house in a northern
district, and explaining
that the man for whom
she had been keeping house
had stood her on the em-
bers of the fire in her
stocking-feet because she
wouldn't love him. As
she didn’t love him any
more after several minutes
of this treatment, and the
only change in her was
that she was considerably
charred, he then allowed
her to leave his service,
which she did with con-
siderable difficulty. That
is her interesting version
of the matter, anyhow.

some desperate individual armed with a pen-
knife or a tooth-pick hacks his way through the
fragile walls into freedom, and then there’s a
rumpus. The other day a prisoner in a Towns-
ville lock-up cut a hole through the floor, but was
yemoved ere he could make use of it. Three
drunks took his place, one of whom discovered
the aperture. Feeling thirsty, the trio vacated
the limbo and levanted down the street in search

and peacefully resumed possession of the apart-

well connected ( i.e ., chained up) at night. While groom-
ing away, a new arrival came up and looked on ; they
exchanged words, the new-chum remarking that groom-
ing was an old game of his “on the other side.” “Do
you want a job?” inquired the prisoner. The new
arrival said he did. “ Well, you can start now,” said the
prisoner, handing him the brush and comb. After he had
rubbed several horses, the police-sergeant came out and
inquired surprisedly : “What are you doing here, my
man?” “The boss has put me on grooming,” said the
new man. “Which boss?” asked the sergeant. “That
one there,” he said, pointing to a man asleep under a
mulga-tree. “ Why, he is a prisoner ! ” exclaimed the
sergeant. And the new groom left, thinking it.was the
closest shave he ever had to being in gaol.

A lot of the people who are agitating for pile-baths are
simply political-popularity hunters who, as they don’t
live in or near Double Bay, don’t care a rap what hideous-
ness they inflict on one of Sydney’s most, beautiful spots?

it will help to keep out of the State legislature any man,
whatever his other views, who in Convention opposes a
one-man-one-vote Federal franchise... J.R. : Kindly ca 11..,,

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Feb. 23, 1897.
My Dear Myee—
Some 20 intrepid female-suffragists mounted the
platform at Premier Reid’s meeting the other
evening and explained by their attitude the whole
policy of woman in demanding her rights. They
trailed expectantly up the steps to find every chair
filled by a male voter, who turned a stony face to
the wistful glances of the unenfranchised enthu-
siasts and clung to his seat with a no-surrender
glare in his eye. After a drooping period of
standing around, some mere men in the hall (you
see, it wasn’t their “ funeral ”) yelled reprovingly,
“ Why don’t yer give the lydies a seat ? ” Where-
upon the platform supporters of G.H.R. grudg-
ingly arose and the chairs were triumphantly
grabbed and sat down upon by the suffrage-
demanders—who thus proved their determination
to eat their cake and have it too. The idea of
having to give up seats to would-be fellow-voters
seemed to rankle in the dispossessed-chair-
holders’ minds ; chairs and votes are too much to
concede to any sex. It is easy to see which would
be the more valuable gift. What tired woman in
an over-heated hall is there who would not will-
ingly exchange the franchise for a chair ?
Cremation is now craved by Sydney women.
They yearn to be in the hot water of politics
during their life-time and to be thrust in
an oven afterwards. This is the treatment by
which an experienced cook can turn a tough old
hen into a tender spring-chicken—stewing it for
hours and then roasting it. One society for im-
proving the mind has caught on to the body-
baking notion with such ardor that lady-members
are all making their wills and givingdirections for
post-mortem suttee. A deceased Darlinghurst
lady who has been buried in the usual long box
—against her expressed wish to lie on a funeral
pyre—is to be exhumed and cremated as soon as
the Govt, oven has been set up.
Sydney women are now to be allowed to sit
outside (?) ’busses if they solemnly promise not to
flirt with the driver. Some adventurous girls are
already using their new freedom and cautiously
climbing the iron stair to the heights above, but
their stiffer and portlier elders still crouch inside
and break the tall trimmings of their millinery
against the low roof. That is the real cause of
the present desire to sit on the roof. A fashion-
ably-plumed hat on an average-sized woman
emerges from a ’bus interior a shattered wreck.
Cabs are also a very tight-fit for the animated
fashion - plates arrayed in all their fuss and
feathers.
The Very Nicest had an opportunity for title-
worshipping in this city last week, as it was the
gathering ground of many tufted notables on the
move. The Maoriland Govt. House contingent
was here for a few days on its way to Melb.
to catch the P. & O. for ’Ome, and two aristo-
cratic globe-trotters, Magheramorne and wife,
arrived on Friday per Auckland boat. Lady M.
is sister to Vic. A.D.C. Lord Shaftesbury. Both
Sydney and Melbourne vice-regal halls will be
deserted by their queens next winter. Her Ex. of
each province is departing pro few. An Austra-
lian Governor’s wife would make a record now by
staying out her full term from start to finish with-
out a break.
Male aristocratic wastrels are common enough
in Australia. An authentic “Hon.’’ is tram-
conducting in Melb. A few years ago there was
a high-toned, dare-devil push of Anglo-Indians in
Calcutta known as the “F.F.,” or “Famous
Five,” who for some indecorous high-jinks were
forced to disband. One member is now billiard-
marking down South, while another is rouseabout
on a N.Q. station. When “the aristocracy”
“finds its own level” it isn’t a very elevated one.
Praises of the Sydney quarantine station as a
pleasant holiday-resort have been sounded by the
S. M. Herald, who quoted a letter from a laudatory
lady inmate in the style of the patent-medicine
advt. “ A lady’s testimony : —I don’t mind being
kept here a bit. It is really very nice, we go for
long walks and pick flowers.” Who is fee? This
opinion as to quarantine joys wouldn’t be endorsed
by an irate Melb. man who strolled on board the
Nineveh one afternoon to pay a casual call and
was promptly nabbed and run into bondage at Port
Phillip heads for a week.
Arthur Patchett Martin thinks that no truly
great man can exist in Australia—which is possibly
why he is living in London himself. In an
article in an English magazine he tells of several
geniuses whose ability wasn’t recognised in
these benighted regions, and, of course, his
“Colonial Misfits” resolve themselves into the
same old three—Woolner, R.A., Chas. White-
head, and “ Orion ” Horne. The present British
Premier is quoted, but as he didn’t stay at the
diggings, and did go ’Ome and make his record,
he doesn’t count as a colonial misfit or otherwise.
“ It’s the very same dawg. ” Those three names
are continually held up to a rebellious and
stiff-necked generation of subsequent date as
shocking examples of neglected talent. And if
the above are—as they seem to be, for no other
instances are ever forthcoming—the only three in
a century, misfits in Australia are much rarer
than in other places. Every man of any origin-
ality is more or less a misfit anywhere ; if his im-
mediate surroundings never burst at the seams,
crack up the back, and give way at the buttons—
if he never becomes too big for his boots—the
chances are that he will shrink up and be alto-
gether overwhelmed by the vastness of his world-
vestment. Melba, Streeton, Salmon Wilson,
Alice Cornwell, Agnes Murphy, and the just-
departed military detachment, might all be classi-
fied ur.dir the same head as “Colonial Misfits.’’
The actual “ Colonial Misfit ” is residing at an
adjacent province’s most popular seaside resort,
where she has for many years been an inhabitant.
Her story is romantic and in the manner of story-
books. Born of a haughty British noble family,
she made a runaway match with a groom, or some
such menial, and shipped herself and husband to
Australia, where they have lived in poverty and
reared a numerous offspring in copper-toed boots
and holland pinafores. Now all the lives between
herself and the family title have failed, and she
finds herself a countess or something in her own
right, and is much embarrassed at the position,
for she rightly thinks that her old man, with mole-
skins and a short pipe, would be a decided misfit
in her ancestral, marble halls, and the children
would be ostentatiously ignorant of the use of
serviettes.
On Saturday evening the first reunion of the
season was given by Madame Juliette Henry to the
French Literary Club. The rooms were filled
with a crowd of mixed nationalities who all
chattered French with ease and listened to a pro-
gramme consisting of songs and music and a
microscopic play with a great deal of “ La gloire,”
and “La France,” and “ L’Allemagne,” and
“ Revanche” in it. The male character was played
by an intending tourist who will shortly have an
opportunity of testing his accent by parley-vooing
with the Parisians on their native heath. A boy’s
part was taken by a girl newly-arrived in Sydney,
and she fearlessly donned sailor’s duds for the
occasion, and wore them well.
Maoriland women have never taken to brightly-
tinted bonnets. I met a wandering islander who
was astounded at the loud and gaudy head-gear
displayed on every Sydney woman’s crown. Sailor-
hats are always full-dress regalia with Dunedin
belles; they also love to adorn themselves with
Mosgiel tweeds —handsome, but everlasting, so
they do not need many changes of raiment. The
frivolities of lace and muslin and evanescent
beauties of silks appeal not to their stony Scotch
common-sense.
Westmacott’s co. changed quarters on Saturday
night, and opened at the Royal in “ A Mother’s
Sin,” before an unremarkable d.c-., from which
hats are now sternly banished. The weepiness of
the play is brightened by two well got-up scenes —
one, a cornfield of the “ Ripening Sunbeam ” type,
and the other a picturesque old mill, such as are
scattered over the face of dear old England, ap-
parently as body-traps and accessories to murder.
Minna Phillips supplies some comic relief, but
spoils her appearance by dressing her tow-colored
thatch like a haystack. Miss Fitzmaurice Gill, as
the guilty mother, although erring is fashionable,
and wears a pretty pale-green gown with the
Sleeves beginning halfway down her arms, and a
large red patch like a mustard-poultice on her
chest. Harrie Ireland’s prettiest effort is in black
and white. One of the most important parts is
played by an erratic clock, marking the flight of
time by leaps and bounds. While the villain is
robbing the safe in the banking-chamber, lime-
light is thrown strongly on the hands jerking
spasmodically over the face of the tick-tock in a
perfect frenzy of making-up for lost time.
Some of the glories of the R.C. Easter Fair are
being revealed beforehand to admiring suburban
audiences. A special lustre will be lent to the
Burwood stall by a large collection of barbaric
gems and gold and gorgeous Indian embroidery,
got by one of the workers on a visit to India. The
popular notion of Eastern decorations is that it is
all cheap bamboo, peacock-feathers, and gaudy
pocket-handkerchiefs, varied with porcupine-quill
boxes and warranted-not-to-last rush baskets.
But some of this display of Benares brasswork
and gold-thread needlework recalls the days
before the wily Hindoo employed Brummagem to
glut the market for the cheap tourist.
An aspiring playwright, Mr. H. Leader, pro-
duced an original play with great favor last week
in King-street Opera House, which superannuated
home of the drama was enlivened by crowds of
friends and admirers in eveningdress who crowded
the d.c. and filled the stalls to suffocation. The
plot of “ An American Romance ” was laid in a
Californian ranche, and dealt with the machina-
tions of an amateur butler thwarted by the hero,
and retiring baffled at the end of the play. The
highly-colored menial was run by the ranche,
which must have been a paying one ; he was re-
ceived with great applause at each entry, and as
he was the host of the evening who put up the
coin for the whole affair —gilt-edged invitations
and all—he showed great humble-mindedness by
beginning at the foot of the ladder and choosing a
“ my-lord-the-carriage-waits ” part. The financial
backer, as a rule, wants the leading rdle—villain
for choice. In this one night’s run the bold, bad
man had most of the stage to himself, and
muttered “ perraps ’’ with terrible emphasis. In
the after-piece, Jessie Clitherow, in black velvet
knickers and a crimson sash, was a big but
brightly natural Little Fauntleroy.
Two songs and a piano-flourish come from W. H.
Glen and Co., the composition of Louisa Clarke,
who is not a beginner, for she composed a melo-
dious song, “ Beauty’s Lullaby,” about two dozen
months ago, and, to the technically-trained ear,
her harmonies and settings shows that she knows
her subjects. Moreover, there is an unexpected-
ness in the phrasing and a refreshing originality in
a world of hackneyed tunes that show she has just
the one thing needful in a song-writer—a kind of
artless self-expression, precious because of the un-
consciously-revealed individuality. “ Ma belle
amie est morte ” is a gem. The musician’s daring
attempt to write up to Iheophile Gautier’s words
is justified ; her music intensifies his pathos, and
there are tears in the exquisite lyric with a back-
achey little break in the rhythm of the accompani-
ment. But it should be sung in French. “My
Little Boat and I ” is good music set to musical
lines by an Adelaide girl, Ethel Mac George. “It
May be Love,” by Bert Royal and Leon Caron, is
the song in which Fiorrie Young has been fetch-
ing an admiring public with an effective top-note
in “ Matsa.” Now published by Nicholson, it is
a brilliant, flashy song, smelling of the footlights.
A romantic opera, in three acts, called “Romance
of Corsica,” by Aug. Juncker, libretto by C. Prid-
ham, stated vaguely on the programme “ of
N.5.W.,” was given a preliminary trial-trip at the
Oddfellows’ Temple on Thursday night, when the
music was run through as a rehearsal for the first
performance, which comes off next Saturday in the
Opera House. An elaborately-worded programme
gave the plot of this entirely local production deal-
ing witfo “ bravi ” and “vendettas” and other
characteristic events in the every-day life of Aus-
tralians. Why go abroad for plots ? What’s the
matter with writing “Romance of Australia,”
and founding an opera on the Dean case, with the
Judge’s summing-up motto ralentando in four flats
or whynot dramatioallychant the Glenbrook trage-
dies, giving Butler the basso profundo s part, and
introducing in a pastoral scene the picnic parties
who waited for the bodies to be dug up .
men who didn’t go prospecting with Butler could
be in the chorus, and sing presto agitato of their
narrow escape, and the Swanhilda s voyage o
in a barcarolle. The audience-an invitation one
—applauded vigorously whenever there was room
to clap hands ; the place was crowded, and the
orchestra loud and untamed ; but until the merry
peasants get into their Corsican garb and the hero
can lurk among realistic stage-mountains the pro-
duction can’t be properly judged.
Australian artists of all kinds voyage to the big
smoke to try their luck now-a-days. Ihe latest
thus to display the ambition of shining in a wider
sphere is a costume-artist, known locally as the
Australian Worth,” who has set up in business on
her own account in Hanover-street, W. London.
Family portraits will be one of the attractions
of the loan exhibition at the opening of the new
N.S.W. Art Gallery, as, by circular, owners of
pictures are invited to send in all they can, in-
cluding miniatures. It gives me that tired feeling
already to anticipate gazing at staring-eyed, stodgy
ancestors, and peering inquisitively into gaudy
little portraits of pink-cheeked, high-waisted
beauties and stern military personages, with iron-
like stocks and dead-black shadows under their
noses, while the gratified alleged descendants of
same swell with pride at being able to point to
grandfather in oils.
Chinese market-gardeners love to raise large
flocks of ducks and extensive families of chow-
puppies and kittens. A Sydney woman asked her
vegetable John for one of the fat and furry little
balls she often saw playing about his much-dilapi-
dated shanty. John said : “ Bym by ; too young
now, too wild ! ” Three weeks later he appeared
remarking smilingly : “ Too late cook him dinner ;
you cook him tea, welly ni.” Then the kitten was
produced, neatly skinned and dressed d la rabbit.
Piety and pipeclay, theology and tar, are
much intermingled in the congregation of St.
James’ (Sydney). The other night, in a chartered
steamer, a little band of them forged their way
into the middle of the British fleet off Farm Cove
and unanimously yelled that dreary wheeze, “I
love Jack,” for upwards of an hour, much to the
disgust of Jack in question, who wanted to get to
sleep and didn’t want to be loved at all —except,
you know, in his own peculiar girl-on-each-arm
fashion. When the Gulf of Martaban, with the
N.S.W. Mounted Rifles on board, cast off from
the wharf the St. Jamesites arrived again in a
cheap and wheezy steamer and sang in fervent
chorus, “ I Love a Volunteer ; ” but as for reasons
which it would be rude to set down here the
volunteers in question didn’t care whether they
loved ’em or not, it all fell very flat. For a con-
gregation roaring around with a large amount of
love on board St. James’ undeniably takes the
cake.
Title-giving is a subject of feverish interest just
now, and it would not be a bad opportunity for
the record-reign to distinguish itself by having a
universal adjustment of name-handles. Discus-
sions on the point are constantly starting and
dying out before anything is settled. The “ Mrs. ”
or “Miss’’ confusion in addressing letters to a
woman-correspondent of whom one only knows
the name and not the state, was threshed out a
few months ago by the Austral Salon, but the
muddle was not cleared up, the only satisfactory
suggestion (that the correspondent be addressed
by her front name and surname only minus tag)
being scouted as disrespectful. It would save
much time and worry if all correspondence were
so addressed without the prefix of “ Mr.,” “Mrs.”
or “Miss.” As for “ Esq.,” that utterly meaning-
less affix ought to be abolished and pass into
oblivion when the century ends. Another point
agitated in the title-wrangle is the non-official re-
cognition of bishop’s wives. It is suggested that
women, whose husbands are legally mylorded,
should be something more than plain “Mrs.,”
which is absurd, as a bishop gets his handle pro-
fessionally, and his wife has nothing to do with
that. To call a bishopess “my lady ” would be
prompted by the same hankering after distinction
as leads to the vulgarism of “Mrs. Dr.” and
“Mrs. Prof.”
An advertiser, seeking an office-assistant, asks
for a “boy or young lady (age required), short-
hand or typist,” wages ss. a week. The gentle-
man wants either a small boy or a large girl, with
phonograph and typing thrown in. This,’as an
opening for an educated girl; would pay about as
well as giving music-lessons, as advertised at 2s.
weekly, or serving in a tea-room, which some en-
thusiasts do for love, or writing a correspondence-
column for certain foreign newspapers, which some
women do for the honor and glory.
Writes my Melb. correspondent
“Mrs. Saunders, wife of a well-known Mel-
bourne jockey, is the latest acquisition to the ranks
of professional amateur singers. She has a fine
soprano voice, well-trained, and well-preserved,
and Mrs. Nicholas Fitzgerald is trying to work
the oracle among fashionable ‘ At-Homists ’ to
secure their interest for the new vocalist. The
experience of old professionals with these sassiety
hostesses has been of a nature to warn the rising
stars against any particular anxiety to assist at
private musical- functions.

“ Melbourne’s much-photographed beauty made
a tame first appearance in “Prisoner of Zenda ”
so tame that the plaudits from her organised body
of admirers in the d.c. sounded ironical to the un-
infatuated majority. The delicate features of the
pink-and-white matron are ineffective for stage
purposes, her slender neck lacks dignity, and her
carriage, if not naturally ungraceful, is at present
singular in its self-consciousness. Mrs. M.M,
outraged the canons of good taste by making her
debut (at King Rudolph’s court) minus one glove
the naked hand, unduly en evidence and dummy-
fied, being heavily stocked with diamond rings
the largest of which shone forth from the first
digit.

sible, and peering round imperceptible corners.
There are more of her pictures in the shops than

Be Federal Convention. Melb. Argus
raises the usual cry of the swamping of country
by town. On another page in same issue was re-
ported a meeting of 250 at Newstead—a fanning
village of one street —exactly the same number as
collected in Melb. Town Hall ten days later.
N. C. Lockhart, the newly-appointed
solicitor to the N.S.W. Land and Income Tax
Commissioners, was unfortunate in the recent
competitive test for the chief-clerkship of N.S.W.
Supreme Court. His papers were officially de-
clared to be the best, but as they were not done
within prescribed time he could not be given the
appointment. When time was called, Lockhart
found that there were half-a-dozen short questions
“ overleaf ” ; the slip cost hun first place. Lock-
hart is the first solicitor appointed to any particu-
lar department of N.S.W. Public Service. He
was articled in the country, but got his Sydney
experience with solicitor “ Banjo ” Paterson
At the Sydney meeting of parsons and
others to secure “the defeat—the humiliating de-
feat—of Card. Moran ” for the Federal Convention,
after Stigginsdom had raved and roared and
picked its little special bunch of candidates, Rev.
J. E. Carruthers, obviously a clerical humorist of
the purest water, said, “Let us now come down
from this heated atmosphere,” and moved an
unctuous resolution for a day of special prayer
that the Great Head of the Nations would boss the
elections satisfactorily. In other words, the par-
sons settle things the way they want ’em, and
then invite the Deity to carry out their instruc-
tions as a matter of form. If the Great Head of
the Nations doesn’t get the parsonic bunch duly
elected there will evidently be ructions in Paradise.
The Bulletin has a gloomy idea that, when
the numbers go up, all the Australasian Premiers,
every man-jack of them, will be found grovelling
in person at the feet of Queen Victoria, at the
record-reign celebration. There are some “big”
men who talk Republicanism under their breath,
but this paper only knows one Australasian poli-
tician who, from a national point of view, is solid—
he has the right kind of wife. You can tell what a
man sincerely believes from what his wife believes.
“The greatest disgrace into which my husband
could fall would be the acceptance of a title,” says
the wife of that politician, almost fiercely—and,
mind you, he could easily get a title, being just
the man whom the Pimperialists would delight in
nobbling—“ for it would mean the utter abandon-
ment of principle, the turning of his back upon
himself. He is a Republican to the core, and I
am a Republican. For him to take a title would
mean the utter defilement of our life.” And when
you look round their home, and see in the places
d honor upon the walls decorated portraits of
Mazzini, and Washington, and Andrew Jackson,
and Lincoln, you feel in your heart that there is
in Australasia one professing Democrat who will
never take a title, in that he is so fortunate as to
have a wife strong enough and intelligent enough
to despise baubles given for the purpose of poli-
tical and social corruption.

A FUTURE PROSPECT.
Attorney-General Byrnes (Q.) was the
first to formulate and carry a motion praying
Queen Victoria to promote an Australian Judge
to the Privy Council. He meant Griffith, so that
one part of his desire is unfulfilled.
N. : “ Hugh, or Hugo R. Reid, the Hon-
orable George H. ’s brother, is of Sydney interest.
Domiciled in Melb. these 30 years, hardly anyone
seemed to know he was the brother of George
till the accident of an official position lodged him
in the chair at the banquet. Hugo is a Freetrader
in the job-lots out of George’s intellectual ware-
house. His utterances are not unlike sawing
wood.”
Catherine Helen Spence, the only Aus-
tralian woman candidate for the Federal Conven-
tion, is, although about 70 years of age, one of the
most vigorous of S.A. politicians and as brainy as
most of the other candidates. Miss Spence is a
thorough democrat, and considers “one adult one
vote ” as the Federal franchise the vital question.
She has been a leader-writer on S.A. Register
for years past.
Phil May has been elected a member of
the Royal Institute of Painters in Water-
Colors. “ When an honor like this is con-
ferred on a man of talent so extremely un-
conventional both in his art and his persona-
lity as Mr. Phil May,” says S.M. Herald’s
London correspondent, “it cannot be said that
our recognised authorities are altogether unin-
fluenced by the spirit of the times.”
Neither Chaffey Baker, President of S.A.
Legislative Council, nor Symon, Q.C., attended
the bar meeting on the occasion when Chief-Jus-
tice Way was congratulated on his accession to
the Privy Council. Kingston offered compliments
as Attorney-General, and the pair named are at
daggers drawn with him. However, they will
have him for a colleague if they secure election to
the Federal Convention, which appears very doubt-
ful, as the Liberals are running a strong ticket of
ten.
No lack of wormy reverence in this
greasy cablegram :
The Premier and Lady Turner have the honour and
pleasure of accepting the invitation of her Majesty’s
Government to visit England on the occasion of the cele-
bration of the Queen’s 60 years’ reign. There is a univer-
sal feeling of gratification throughout the colony that it
has been honoured by being permitted to take part
through the head of its Government in this unique
demonstration, and in thus having the opportunity once
more of evincing the loyalty and affection of the people
of Victoria to the Throne and person of her Majesty the
Queen.
At 88 years of age, the veteran Capt.
Rogers, of Bingara diamond-mining fame, has
entered the Alfred Hospital, Sydney, to be

A Sydney publisher has under considera-
tion a brochure entitled “Was O’Farrell Mad ? ”
The pamphlet purposes to show that Charles
Lyne, in his Life of Parkes, betrays a prejudice or
an ignorance which makes his big book worthless
as history.
“ Hansardian’s ” “complete” list of Vic-
torian knights in last week’s Bulletin was not
complete. It omitted Patterson, Snowden, Sar-
good, Brownless and McCoy. One is dead and for-
gotten, and three are alive and not remembered ;
all are bebaubled nobodies.
Mayor Tucker, of Adelaide, solemnly
avers that the attacks to which he has been sub-
jected by the local mining men are all instigated
by spite against the Hospital Board, of which he
is chairman. The miserable hospital row pervades
everything South Australian nowadays.
First-class constable Peter Dunne, who
died last week, was considered the handsomest
man in the N.S.W. force, which is saying not a
little. His coffin was borne by six stalwart com-
rades, and over 100 constables attended the
funeral, which the police band preceded.
Justice Power (Q.) refused to accept bail
in a capital case (rape), the other day, and justified
himself on the ground that Justice Lutvvyche in a
similar case, 20 years ago, accepted bail on account
of one Wheeler, who incontinently bolted, letting
in his bondsmen, and has never been heard of
since.
Failing the Governments, explorer Borch-
greyink hopes to get from private sources in Aus-
tralia the funds for uis desired voyage due South,
over the South Victoria continent. Premier
Turner wouldn’t give the subject more than a
moment’s thought, not caring one straw for the
South Pole.
Arthur Streeton’s departure for Europe
Starts a momentous exodus of Vic. artists. Long-
staff, Davis, and Fox, three of the best Southern
painters, are already packing in readiness for an
early departure. Longstaff’s merits as a portrait-
painter a,re well-known in London, and his success
in that city is assured.
Ex-warder Longford, late recorder of Dar-
linghurst, who died the other day in the Alfred
Hospital, Sydney, was a man of marvellous
memory and great prison experience. He had a
keen eye for the picturesque and striking, and was
a born newspaper-reporter who died with most of
his best “ copy ” in him.
George Ash, Premier Kingston’s law-
partner, is the champion S.A. litigant. Ash,
although at present getting better of typhoid, has
two actions on hand, the latest being against
the Weekly Herald (Labor organ). His dry,
monotonous manner in the courts has earned for
him the nick-name of “Dry ’Ash.”
Editor Cooper, of the Scotsman, in a Syd-
ney interview, affects to despise the personal
journalism which touches the appearance and
manners of men, and is “ quite sure the British
public doesn’t want that class of matter.” But
Mr. Cooper’s book, “ An Editor’s Retrospect,” is
nine-tenths personal in this very sense.

At 10 o’clock at night, the other evening,
Brisbane (Q.) cathedral rang chimes for the return
from England of Canon Stone-Wigg. Who is the
hyphenated one ? Well, he’s the parson who went
away on a 12-months’ tour when his parish owed
him <£9o in back salary, and who cadged <£lsoo
out of Bull for his church funds. Well might the
bells ring.

Sydney, somewhere or other, contains the
graves of some of the most illustrious musicians of
a past generation—Nicholas Charles Bochsa, the
first president of the first Royal Academy of Music
in the days of Charles Lucas, Sterndale Bennett,
George Alexander Macfarren, and a string of the
best musicians England ever knew ; Charles S.
Packer also, of “ Crown of Thorns ” fame ; Louis
L. Lavenu, too, who wrote the opera of “Loretta.”
And how may we forget the skilful Italian pianist
Cutolo (killed by the falling of a boom on the s.s.
Alexandra) who played so beautifully ? Where
are they all buried ?
Christie Palmerston, the report of whose
death at Gulla Pilah. on the Malay Peninsula,
came to hand last week, was an old Queensland
explorer and goldfields pioneer. He was known
principally to the press by his self-advertisement
in connection with the Barron ranges, &c. Christie
Palmerston was a crack revolver-shot, and one of
those bold, adventurous frontiersmen who stick at
nothing, and whose luck it becomes to get histori-
cally mantled with all shades of legendary lore,
from the peaceful violet to the deepest red tinge.
He had been for some years in the employ of the
Straits Development Co.
“Lady” Munro cropped up at Melb.
City Police Court again, the other day, after a
long absence, and was fined the usual ss. Lady
Munro is a valuable source of revenue wherever
she is, and The Bulletin opines that in the event
of Federation she will have to be located at
the Federal capital to prevent interprovincial
jealousies.
Governor Lamington’s father was the lively
and iconoclastic Buckhurst of Beaconfield’s “ Con*
ingsby.” In his pre-peerage days, Lamington
fibre was one of the most promising of the “Young
England ” party.
Judge Blake, who ran the
Q. District Court before Judge
Paul’s day, had an unconquerable
partiality for vigorous language.
It was in Dalby, and Healy, pro-
secuting in an important case,
was haranguing the jury, when
a terrific battle sprang up between
a huge retriever and a bull-pup
under the court window. “ Ex-
cuse me, Mr. Healy,” sain Blake,
when howls and loose hair filled
the atmosphere; “gerrout of way,
sergeant.” The Judge watched
the match finish with exuberant en-
joyment, and then said : “ Damn
good dog-fight that; best (asterisk)
dog-fight I’ve seen in the colony.
Proceed, Mr Healy.” Shortly
after that the Roma print “went
for ” the Judge’s weakness in half-
a-yard of long primer, and Paul,
who was prosecuting, got the
article under Blake’s eye just to
see what he would say. “ Did I
ever say anything that might not
have been said in the presence
of the purest lady of the land,
Paul?” asked the Judge with
ominous solemnity. “ No, your
Honor.” “ Then may Belial ex-
plode the crimson eyes of the
sanctified blackguard who wrote
this ” —and other similar senti-
ments well into the night. Blake
got lost in the worst country
on a run owned by a squatter of
gay propensities. He worried
round till sundown, and then
stumbled into a blacks’ camp.
“YVhoowns this(pestiferous)run?”
“Oh, belonga Missa H ,” was
the response. “ Might have
known that, seeing so many
blanky gins about,” was his
Honor’s comment.
Lieut.-Col. H. B. Lassetter, who con-
ceived the plan for sending a detachment of
New South Wales Mounted Rifles to Eng-
land, spoke on the subject thus to a Bulletin
man: “This movement is a patriotic one; its
object is to give the men of the detachment six
months of real military training side by side with
the Imperial troops, to mould the men into com-
petent instructors. We must have young, active
instructors for the N.S.W. service instead of old,
worn-out Imperial officers. The officers, men and
horses of the detachment are all natives of
N.S. W., and the cost of the undertaking is mostly
borne by the N.S.W. Mounted Rifles Regiment;
the officers and men of which contribute ,£2s*>o ;
other contributions are, Major Onslow, <£soo;
Mrs. Onslow, <£2so; Miss Walker, ,£250; the
N.S. W. Govt., £5OO. The trip will cost each of the
officers £lOOO out of his private purse ; with regard
to the personnel of the detachment, the men are
such as any nation might be proud to own—mostly
selectors’ sons and b mndary-riders—the real iron-
bark ; you couldn’t drive nails into them. You
should see the muscles on those fellows when they
are swimming their horses. The tallest man is
Oft. sin., and the average is sft. 10in., that is,
above the minimum height of the same class of
men in the British army. The trip will be no
picnic; it will be hard soldiering all the six
months on a pound of bread, a pound of meat,
tea, sugar and Is. 9d. per day ; sleeping out in
the open. Out of the whole time there will be
only eight days in London, and those for the
Military Tournament.”
Writes “ San dak ” : —Dear Bulletin, —-
Rc the judgment of N.S.W. Full Court in the
Macleod (alleged bigamy) case. The judgment in
question was given by a majority of the Full
Court (Darley, C..T., and Innes, J.), Windeyer
dissenting. The latter’s judgment was a masterly
exposition of the law, and was confirmed on
appeal to the English Courts immediately after-
wards. Your attitude to this Judge has never
been concealed, but let even the Devil have his
due.
“A deserved compliment has been paid
to Mr. Cooper (editor of the Scotsman) in Sydney,”
says S.M. Herald. “Immediately on his arrival
he was informed that he had some time previously
been elected an honorary member of the Union Club,
and he is staying at that institution.” “ A
deserved compliment ” (to the editor of one of the
world’s best-known papers): to be allowed to asso-
ciate for a month or two with the choicest members
of the Sydney snobocracy—who are so condescend-
ing that they actually allow the fact to be an-
nounced in their own special organ ! “A deserved
compliment ” ! Ye gods !
When Premier Reid journeyed between
Melbourne and Lome the Vic. Railway Depart-
ment placed at his disposal a first-class compart-
ment, but he frequently slipped into an ordinary
second-classer to escape being stared at by loungers
at roadside stations. On one of these occasions
he had for a companion a small boy of apparently
14 years. The latter told the Premier that he had
been three times round the world. “ what sort
of trip had you last time?” said G.H.R. to the
youthful Ananias. “ Oh, just the usual milk-and-
water one,” replied the hardened little reprobate.
After that the Freetrade orator got back to his
own compartment.
Apropos Trentham (Vic.) and its 340
people who desire to be personally addressed by
all the Convention candidates, the little place was
ruled in the early Sixties by “ Orion ” Horne
poet and journalist, who was warden there for a
couple of years. It used to be complained that)
the warden never could be found on the gold-
held. Where is the warden ? ” “ Well ” the
policeman in charge would say, “the warden is
either in Kyneton, or in Melbourne, or at his
home m St. Kilda—come to-morrow an’ I’ll let
yez know.” Which grew so monotonous that
vrovt. asked Mr. Horne to take a well-earned rest,
which lie did. The old author went to England
and obtained a civil-list pension of <£so a year, on
which he lived and died.

sleep. I consulted a medical man, who told
me that my liver was badly affected, and my

POLITICAL
POINTS
The death of Mr. William Laidley reduces
the number of members in N.S.W. Leg. Council
to 64. Six members are now absent in Europe.
The certainties in the Vic. Federation
election are (according to the forecast of a candi-
date who is not included in them) Turner, Pea-
cock, Deakin, Wrixon, and Sargood, in the order
named.
A beautiful touch in Cardinal Moran’s
Sydney D.T. interview was his remark as to the
ingratitude shown by the Orange party in not in-
cluding in their Convention ticket the name of
“their friend, Mr. Haynes.”
Of the 33 S.A. Federation candidates the
democrats claim 13, the Tories 14. Apparently
the S.A. election will be contested on party lines.
One candidate lately suggested that the election
should be made a test on the local Hospital
question!
Charters Towers (N.Q.) Eagle, considering
the question of Premier Nelson’s absence in Hing-
land shortly, remembers three possibles, either of
whom might serve as acting-Premier—“ Tozer, the
discreditable; Byrnes, the perverted ; and Philp,
the incapable.”
The immortal Dan O’Connor, rising to the
apex of the great federal argument in Albury:
“ The colonies were made to be united. God has
said so.” And, what is also to the point, Dan
has said so, also William Charliss Wintworth and
Daniel Hinry Dinahee.
Bruce Smith says that if Australia were
polled on the question of a Republican Govt, not
one man in a hundred would be in favor of it.
This will, indeed, be news to the Labor party in
Parliament, who, with the big forces behind them,
are nearly all avowed Republicans.
Undoubtedly the proper caper for the pre-
sent N.S.W. political juncture is W. J. Lyne’s:
“ I am neither an Orangeman nor a Catholic, but
have friends amongst both.” Wasn’t it Beau
Brummell who said he would be equally at home in
Heaven or in hell —he had many good friends in
both places.
Eugowra (N.S.W.) now urges its claim to
be the Federal city on account of “ its beautiful
climate, situation, scenery, and historical renown ”
—the historical renown being based on the fact
that some bushrangers (probably local aldermen
with masks on) once stuck-up and robbed a gold-
escort there.
One advantage of making Liverpool
(N.S.W.) the Federal capital would be that
legislators, when they lost their seats, could hop
right into the big local poor-house. But Rook-
wood, which is nearer Sydney, would be an even
better site: it also has a big poor-house, with the
cemetery right next-door.
S.A. National Ass party has included
Kingston and other prominent Ministerialists in
its Federation ticket—an ingenious scheme de-
signed to help along hard-crusted Tories like
Baker, and Downer, who would have poor
chances in a straight-out party conflict. The
democrats, however, decline to accept the bait.
Of the 33 S.A. Federal Convention candi-
dates, Kingston, Cockburn, Gordon, Baker, and
Downer were at Sydney Convention in ’9l. The
other two S.A. delegates on that occasion were
Bray (who is dead) and Agent-General Playford.
Not one Federal candidate in Adelaide or vicinity
has managed to draw a good audience to listen to
his address.
About the least likely of the Vic. candi-
dates for the Federal Convention stakes is Robert
Reid, M.L.C., the soft-goods politician who went
’Ome, during the Patterson regime, on a bogus
mission. Reid has no admirers outside of Flin-
ders-lane, and the bulk of the admiration that he
gets from the drapery trade is for his cast-iron
political front.
Treasurer Fysh, of Tasmania, has issued
an address to the electors, instructing them to
vote for “experienced” candidates in the Federal
elections in order to keep the “local” politician
out of the Convention. Tasmania, however, isn’t
big enough for a purely local politician to success-
fully hide himself in, and the local politician, as
pourtrayed by Fysh, is very little more local than

very, very beautiful about Fysh, the very moder-
ate politician of a very small island, posing as a
vast cosmopolitan individual and calling some-

need have no fear of the
parsons seriously injur-
ing the secular education
system under present
conditions. The clergy
are allowed to attend at
the schools on certain
days in the week and
dose the children with
gospel after hours, and
occasionally little bands
of holy men have a bad
attack of pious zeal, and
go devil-baiting at the
schools with great assid-
uity for a few weeks,
but they always “peter
out” after a short and
unprofitable season, and
the school is presently
given over again to the
world, the flesh, and the
devil. “ The people may
rest easy whilst there is
no money in the game.
Not until the parsons
are allowed to take up
collections will they es-
tablish themselves at the
State schools,” said a
suburban head - master
to the writer. It is true
that the Cloth never
takes a serious and abid-
ing interest in any move-
ment that ignores the
plate, but in their small
way the saints make
themselves sufficiently
objectionable. When af-
fected with an evangeli-
cal spirit they circularise
parents to the effect that,
if specific objection is
not raised, they will take
it for granted that child-
ren are to remain to
their Scripture cram;
and so parents grin and
bear it rather than have
their youngsters branded
as turbulent and blas-
phemous infidels, which
would be the probable
result of an objection.

tions at the coming Council elections.

Premier Reid refers to Sydney as “ the
Cradle of Australian Freedom.” If so, a very
proper atonement, for it was also the cradle of
Australian Lagdom.
“ IT’S AN ILL WIND,” Ac.

A Tasmanian Federal candidate bases his
claim to election on his advocacy of the same
qualification for the Senate as obtains in the Tas.
House of Landlords. Which means that the
Senate would be representative of none but those
who owned freehold worth £l5 per annum, or
leasehold worth £5' ', or held a University degree,
or happened to be a lawyer, doctor, clergyman, or
officer, or retired officer of army, navy, or volun-
teer force 1
He thought the colonies were acting in an
arbitrary, un-Christian spirit in prohibiting the
Chinese from landing in Australia. He formerly
held different views, but having given the subject
mature consideration he found it necessary to alter
his opinions. From what he had seen of the
Chinese he thought them a model of industry and
thrift. Many of the European races might take a
lesson from them in this respect with advan-
tage. ... A great deal of the agitation was ficti-
tious, got up by loafers and others, who would not
work themselves, but put obstacles in the way of
those who were industrious. ... He knew his
views were unpopular, but it was an un-Christian
thing to say to these people : ‘We reject you, not
because you are unnecessary or useless, but because
some idle, worthless men object to you on account
of your usefulness.’ ’’—Cardinal Moran.

John Thomas Annear, M.P., the Q. Chair-
man of Committees, foamed against the Labor
members when up at Charters Towers, the other
day. Whereupon the local Eagle asks if this is
the same Annear who, as “the blasted Labor
agitator of Maryborough, started the eight-hours’
movement in that town several years ago? ”
Q. Ministry has succeeded in scabbing over
temporarily its virulent eczema. Unless it erupts
afresh, Tozer will be acting-Premier while Nelson
goes to Hingland, and Byrnes’s wrath will be
turned by finding him a quasi-political mission
that will take him also to Hingland and Yankee-
land during the same period, so that he won’t be
actually put to the purgatory of serving under
Tozer while the latter leads the Assembly.
Nelson, of course, tells everybody that he hasn’t
decided yet whether or not he is going to Hing-
land, but —“ Lady ” Nelson knows better.
Premier Reid alleges, as his reason for
desiring to retain the railways under provincial
management, that the Federal Government
couldn’t control so large a concern. Australia and
Tasmania have 11,600 miles of railway altogether.
In Prussia, the State contrives to manage about
21,000 miles of line ; in Russia, about 16,000 ; and,
in the U.S., one private co. owns and runs over
13,000 miles of railway. Presumably, what G.
Reid really means to say is that the poor, dull,
ignorant Australian hasn’t brains enough to do
what these other people accomplish ; or else that
he and the other men who run the country
haven’t brains enough.
“Tasmanian ” to The Bulletin :
There is another side to the Republican Attorney-
General Clark. Despite his Democratic professions, it is
mainly through his predilections for Fatman that some
thousands of Tasmanians are disfranchised. The rolls
are compiled every November, and, to dodge the effect of
the reduction of voters’ qualification in the Electoral
Amendment Act and the Democratic spirit of the Federal
Enabling Act, the rolls compiled 15 months ago are to
be used at the Federal elections. More than half of the
West Coast miners, and all those who were disfranchised
under the disqualifications existing prior to 1804, will be
unable to vote. Under these circumstances, if any of
the Tas. delegates to the Convention dare to claim that
they represent the Tasmanian people they should be
promptly flabbergasted and cast into outer darkness.
The majority of Tas. Federation candidates
who have yet spoken declare for allowing each pro-
vince to fix its own Federal franchise. As nothing
short of an earthquake, or, at least, 10 years’ agita-
tion, will induce Tas. House of Landlords to abate
one jot of its enormous power by removing the
property-qualification upon which it is elected,
this plan would result in the people of the Land
of Sleep remaining as electorally enslaved as at
present. And, under Federation, the trouble
would be aggravated four times.
PRECEPT AND PRACTICE.
Bull’s bards have raved of ancient Greece,
And bade the Spartan spirit glow
And spurn aside the slavish peace
That sees the Moslem root and grow
Where Grecians flourished long ago.
They’ve sung of fierce Thermopylae.
“ Awake! arise! ” has been the call,
That Greece might once again be free.
But they don’t mean it, not at all—
When Greeks arise the Consols fall !
Q. Premier Nelson fluked on to sanity oi
expression at the late Federal Council session,
when he “ turned dog ” on his Fat Party and on
Presbyterian greed with reference to the New
Hebrides. What are the New Hebrides to Aus-
tralia, anyway ? New Caledonia is nearer to
these shores, and New Caledonia is French. The
dual British-French control is well able to look
after itself, and, although there is a clause in the
treaty between the two powers that neither shall
annex the New Hebrides, what odds is it to Aus-
tralia if France did so? Nelson’s picnicky blurt-
ing out of the truth shocked all his friends, how-
ever, and these have been apologising for him in
Brisbane ever since. It is now denied that Nelson
said, in effect—“To Tartarus with the New
Hebrides,” and the alleged explanation is that he
only declared that, possibly, a French control
would be more satisfactory than the present dual
control. So that the only downright good Aus-
tralian utterance that the writer knows Nelson to
have made, is repudiated. It was a press hack,
too, who dug the way out of Nelson’s party
dilemma; then Attorney-General “Tommy 1
Byrnes endorsed the very-much-strained explana-
tion.

Cairns (N.Q.) had a convuldve fight over the christen-

Marriageable girls will be glad to hear that the report
of Horace Poussard's wedding (for which S.M. Herald is

Haresfoot : “ I object to the leading man being invari-
ably clean-shaved. Every tyro knows it is easier to act

Miss Constance Evelyn goes ’Ome in April to study, and
to try the English concert platform. She will probably

affectedly done. By the way, the S. M. Herald calls Miss
Evelyn a contralto. Which, of course, she isn’t—but
she s an excellent mezzo-soprano.

to get married for all that. He is quite'prepared to find

Miss Watson, who plays the unrelenting adventuress in
Bland Holts latest, at Melb. Royal, subscribed an unre-

enters on horseback, and the hero takes her horse by the
bridle, and argues with her about her morals, and the
necessity of her getting out and securing lodgings at a
nunnery. The haughty adventuress slashes him and
rifles off. Miss Watson got in a most effective slash on
this occasion, and then went over backwards, and, for one
delirious moment, there was a vision of an inverted
actress kicking at the ceiling. Women screamed and
children cried, but at this crisis an inspired super clutched
the fallmg staF, and deposited her safely on the stage,
right end up, and every man in the audience felt moved
to go to the ticket-windows and pay all over again.

representing one ace. The visitor can either buy a com-
plete ticket, with all coupons included, or just those por-
tions of a full-admission voucher which his leisure or
inclination renders desirable.

He says in his circular : “ After a commercial, dramatic,

weakness in regard to advertising in all these departments
is that the advertisements are not placed before the public

blocks the way.

“ Jack’s ” projected visit to Australia is in connection

Not only are the Lower Burdekin (N. 0.)
sugar-mills worked by Japanese, but one planter
there employs Jap. navvies in the construction of
a private railway. Further, he has secured two-
thirds of a public road for an extension of the
line. Ihe average Jap. wage is equal to about
Bs. a week, half of which has to be remitted to the
Jap. txovernment. All the food for these Jap
navvies is imported. The Lower Burdekin begins
to rival ihursday Island as an ant-nest of mon-
grels.
Various correspondents keep on writing at
intervals to point out that the “ Banjo’s ” well-
known verses, “The Man from Ironbark,” are
K re »tly ? nl y a paraphrase of a screed called
Ihe Man from Keek-i-Far,” which appeared in
a Scotch paper some time ago. A correspondent
of Brisbane Worker, writing on this subject,
stated that either “Banjo’’ or the Caledonian
bard, who calls himself “Ayrshire Vagabond/
must be a literary thief, and adds: “Everything
points to Banjo’ being the offender.” The
reason why everything points to “ Banjo,’’ it
seems, is that “ Ayrshire Vagabond ” is “ a well-
known writer of repute and has been before the
Scottish pubhc for over 20 years.” The Bulletin,
to settle this matter once for all, puts the whole
story in three sentences : (1) “ Banjo’s ” verses
appeared first in this paper under date 17th
. ?7 1892 (after having been in hand for at least
eight months) ; (2) The Scotch plagiarist and
literary brigand presented his poem to the public
two years later-about 1894 ; (3) As “Banjo”
couldnt steal Vagabond’s” poem before it
was written, the natural inference is that the
“ Banjo’s ” poem, and even if
the former had been before the public for' 2000
years instead of 20 it would make no difference in
the situation.


Election Notices.
JjIEDERAL CONVENTION ELECTIONS.
As professional engagements will prevent me
from leaving Sydney during the sittings of the
Court, I take this means of making my views
known to the Electors of the Colony.
1. As an Australian, I put the Union of Aus-
tralia before all other questions ; and I am pre-
pared to trust the people of Australia with the
decision of all matters (such as the tariff, provision
for defence, etc.) which affect Australia as a
whole.
2. As a native of New South Wales, I will be
no party to any proposal to diminish the legiti-
mate influence of the Mother Colony, or to lessen
the power of her citizens to deal with matters of
purely local concern.
3. I do not now approach the question of Fede-
ration for the first time, having become acquainted
with its general aspects by long and intimate asso-
ciation with Sir Henry Parkes, and having been
privileged (on the invitation of Sir Samuel Griffith)
to be air unofficial member of the drafting com-
mittee of the Constitution Bill of 1891.
4. I hold that the railways ought to be worked
as one system and under one control, because the
advantages of intercolonial Freetrade cannot
be secured if each colony be at liberty to
make up for the removal of protective duties
by imposing prohibitive railway rates upon the
produce of its neighbors. Whether this control
can be best secured by an inter-State commission,
to be established by the constitution, or by the
Commonwealth taking over the railways, is a
matter upon which I shall be greatly guided by the
opinion of railway and financial experts.
5. I think there should be one Federal Franchise,
and that the senate ought to be elected (as a
guardian of State rights) directly by the people of
each State.
6. If elected I will view all questions impar-
tially without holding myself bound to any cut-
and-dried opinions.
7. I believe that each colony must share in a
general prosperity, and that each will progress
best in the degree in which it is bound up with the
prosperity of all the others.
Yours, &c.,
Feb. 16, 1897.

In the Shadow of Death.
THE CONDITION OF MANY YOUNG
GIRLS IN CANADA.
Pale Faces and Bloodless Lips—Given Yo
Headache—Extreme Weakness, Heart
Palpitation and other Distressing Symp-
toms—The Means oe Cure Readily at
Hand.
(From the Remington Post.,)
The attention of the Post has lately been fre-
quently called to a remarkable cure in the case of
a young girl living within a few miles of this town,
whose life was despaired of, but who was com-
pletely cured in a short space of time by the most
wonderful of all remedies, Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. Since reading in almost every issue of the
Post of the cures effected by this medicine, we
felt it to be a duty we owed our readers to investi-
gate this case which has so urgently been brought
to our notice, and we are sure the interview will
be read with interest by thousands of young girls
all over Canada, as well as by the parents of such
interesting patients. The young lady in question
is not anxious for notoriety, but is willing to make
her case known in order that others who are
similarly afflicted may have an opportunity of
being equally benefitted. The symptoms in her
disease differed in no way from those affecting
thousands of young girls about her age. She was
suffering from extreme weakness, caused by an
impoverished condition of the blood, and her
chances of life seemed to grow less every day.
The best and brightest fade away as well as others,
but when we see a young girl of 16 years, who
should be in the best of health, with cheeks aglow
with the rosy flush of youth, and eyes bright and
flashing, just the opposite, with sallow cheeks,
bloodless lips, listless in every motion, despondent,
despairing of life with no expectation or hope of
regaining health, and with only one wish left,
that of complete rest physical and mental, we
think it one of the saddest of sights.
In the quiet little hamlet of Strangfield, in
Essex county, just such a case was presented to
the sorrowing eyes of loving friends, a few months
ago, in the person of Miss Ella Beacon, who fre-
quently said she did not care how soon she died,
as life had no charms for her. To our reporter she
declared that life had been a burden, but after
suffering in this way for months, and after trying
all sorts of remedies prescribed by physicians or
furnished by friends from some cherished recipe
handed down by their grandmother, but without
being benefitted in the least, she was at last per-
suaded by a neighbour to give Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills a fair trial; but she had tried so many reme-
dies without getting relief, that she still refused
for some weeks. However, after repeated urgings
by her parents and friends she began to use the
Pills. Before one box was taken she experienced
some relief, and after the use of a few more boxes
she was restored to perfect health, and there are
few young girls now who enjoy life more. She
says she owes her life and happiness to Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills, and is willing that all the world
shall know it. Her case attracted much attention
and her perfect recovery has created much com-
ment.
The facts above related are important to parents,
as there are many young girls just budding into
womanhood whose condition is, to say the least,
more critical than their parents imagine. Their
complexion is pale and waxy in appearance,
troubled with heart palpitation, headaches, short-
ness of breath on the slightest exercise, faintness, and
other distressing symptoms which invariably lead
to a premature grave unless prompt steps are taken
to bring about a natural condition of health. In
this emergency no remedy yet discovered can
supply the place of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills,
which build anew the blood, strengthen the nerves,
and restore the glow of health to pale and sallow
cheeks. They are a certain cure for all troubles
peculiar to the female system, young or old. Pink
Pills also cure such diseases as rheumatism, neu-
ralgia, partial paralysis, locomotor ataxia, St.
Vitus’ Dance, nervous headache, nervous prostra-
tion, the after effects of la grippe, influenza, and
severe colds, diseases depending on humors in the
blood, such as scrofula, chronic erysipelas, &c. In
the ease of men they effect a radical cure in all
cases arising from mental worry, overwork, or
excesses of any nature.
They are now obtainable of all chemists, and
from Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company, Queen’s-
place, Sydney, at 2s. 9d. a box, or six for 14s. 9d. ;
but are genuine only with full name, Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.*

Intestate Estates got administration orders in the

Tragic occurrence during a Western dust-
storm, the other day. A lady’s dress was blown
over her head and the hapless female was totally
unable for some time to extricate her capuc from
its envelopings. “But for timely assistance,”
writes a sympathetic scribe, “ she would have
been suffocated.” Let us hope that “God was
good and sent the dust to blow in the bad man’s
eye ! ”

It shows you that the Red Bird is a great
wheel wheti Martin’s Red Bird in Adelaide beats
the world-famous Lesna and, besides, puts up a
world’s record of 2min. 2sec. for Handicap Mile.
Martin, wonder as he is, couldn’t do these things
on any old wheel. But he does it on the Red
Bird, Bill.*
A. L. Baird, of Sydney, whose automatic
judging-machine for pedestrianism has brought
him tons of thanks, but no ha’pence, has contrived
a similarly efficient judging-machine for cycle-
racing. The invention consists of a trench 2in.
wide right across the track, said trench being
occupied by a series of metal leaves inclined at an
angle of 45deg. to the horizontal plane, the first
leaf being gin. above the track’s plane and the
last a full inch above, all painted white. By an
automatic trigger-and-spring device, the passing
of each wheel over the leaves causes the last leaf
met with to fall ; thus a cycle ran over alone with
all five leaves in position will bear five impressions
on the front wheel and four on the back one. In
close finishes the invention would be invaluable,
because the dropping of the leaf is simultaneous
with the instant of contact, and a man with four
impressions on his front wheel couldn’t claub the
race against one with five.*
A very small assault case lately heard at
Wellington (M.L.) brought out at least three dis-
tinct perjurers—possibly four. First of all,
defendant swore that plaintiff and his wife
knocked him down. Second, plaintiff swore that
he knocked defendant down single-handed.
Third, plaintiff’s wife swore that she knocked de-
fendant down without any assistance from her
husband. Fourth, a spectator swore that defend-
ant simply lay down. After all, it is hardly to be
wondered that the average beak is a good deal of
an ass. Any day in his life he is liable to run up
against problems like this at a second’s notice and
be expected to give the judgment of Solomon on
the spot, and his intellect, if he had one to start
with, gets undermined, and then he takes to
drinking gin late at night with the inspector of
police, and his career ends in demoralisation and
hiccup.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The reappearance of Newhaven (also a possi-
bility of Hova popping up) will give tone to the V.R.C.
Autumn Meeting. Newhaven, by the way, looks well and
may win everything he goes for, but he is not a Carbine
sort of horse, whose excellence can be safely taken for
granted at any moment. The Bulletin advises punters
in general to wait until the}' have seen the famous chest-
nut bloom again on Saturday as he bloomed in the Spring
before backing him to win the Champion Stakes. Indeed,
Newhaven’s run-away performances last November (when
he couldn’t have been more fit) gave one the idea that he
might get taken down by a less brilliant animal in a fast
race over three miles. Bloodshot, perhaps, will be the
autumn hero at Flemington when the curtain falls.
This year’s lot of Newmarket Handicap sprin-
ters is so poor as regards “form” up to date, and the
field, large or small, will include so very few tempting
chances, that the betting-market must be looked to for a
tip at the eleventh hour. Wait a-bit (in Alec. Taylor’s
stable) or one of VV. R. Wilson’s will probably start first
favorite, and a solid commission from either direction, or
both, should be good enough for a confiding public to
follow. Cydnus—rushed last week as the “ best of Wil-
son’s”—is said to have a big knee; but even if the fine
Trenton colt be a goner, the St. Alban's party may turn
up the ace of trumps. Anyway, the stable that has such
a reliable test as Aurum, the speedy two-year-old, cannot
go far wrong in its reckoning, so if W. R. Wilson supplies
a hot favorite, the selected one will not need more
than a fair share of luck to land it among the
first three. The writer respects Ayrshire, Valiant, Sun-
bury, Reka, Loch Fad, Coil, So-and-So, Wait-a-bit, and a
right one (doubtful) from St. Albans. For a decided
guess he takes Wait-a-bit, presuming that this dark three-
year-old carries all the hopes and coin of Ballarat on the
day. So-and-So beat Aurum (luckily), and Wait-a-bit,
according to very credible statements, is better than his
stable-companion. A double-event Newmarket and
Australian Cup—win for Wait-a-bit is not out of the
question.
The Australian Cup, on Tuesday, promises to
be boiled down to a small amount of speculation on the
day. Resolute, like Cydnus, is reported “off,” Coil
doesn’t look good for a long journey, and the only other
3-year-old worth considering is Wait-a-bit. He, or Alpine,
may win it for Alec. Taylor, but Blackwood, with only
6st. 71b. to carry, is whispered to have the best chance
among the light-weights. Moderate animals manage to
get home occasionally in the Australian Cup, and Mischief
is not too moderate for this particular journey. An im-
proving mare, built on the stout, old Commotion lines,
Mischief will be as good an investment as Fadladeen,
Bloodshot, Preston, or the others mentioned, at her price.
From Bloodshot, Fadladeen, Wait-a-bit (or Alpine), Black-
wood, and Mischief, the writer has most fancy for the
female candidate.
Mysterious Maliarda, who has been galloping
by moonlight with Ayrshire, was given a chance to dis-
tinguish herself in the Electric Stakes, at Caulfield, last
Saturday. The sister to Maluma ran despicably, and
finished last. It seems as though trainer Redfearn had
wasted a lot of good sleep by rising in the middle of the
night on Maliarda’s account.
Melbourne papers trot out the old gag, “ Heavy
Wagering,” to induce public interest in the V.R.C.
autumn handicaps.
Probable winners during the V.R.C. meeting
are Bloodshot, Preston, Reka, Manfred, Wait-a-bit, Carl-
ton, O Trigger and Mischief.

N.S.W. light-weight, H. Cook, scored two wins
at Caulfield last Saturday, one of his mounts, Twist, start-
ing at the he ilthy price of 33 to 1. This lad is one of the
few light-weights who rides with any judgment. He uses
the flail sparingly, he gofca many good mounts, and wins
his fair share of races.

Dear Bulletin,—“ Cream-colored horses rarely
exceed the age of 15 years.” Now I have had experience
of creamies, and I have rarely known them to die under
that age, accidents and starvation excepted. In this
district I know of some very aged creamies. Mr. James
Duffy, a local farmer, owns one 28 years old, with every
appearance of living another 10 years, and he has two
others over 15 years. Another, owned by one Mick
Jackson, is 22 years old, and a horse known as “ crow
creamy ”is a long way over 20 years. All the above are
in active use at present.—Jack, Koorawatha, 2 2/’97.
* * * *
Aurum (Trenton—Aura) by so decisively beating
Patriot in Electric Stakes at Caulfield may be considered
as the best two-year-old out as yet, though Fleet Admiral,
to whom he is related, should give him a good race when-
ever they meet.
* * * *
Tasmanian racing authorities are more than
satisfied with the “ Tote,” although some of the knowing
ones grumble at having to bet blind. £10,350 passed
through the machine at the recent T.R.C. meeting, and
yielded £llOO revenue to the club. This goes to a fund
to provide stakes for horse-owners, which is better than
providing fizz for Ikey Mo, anyway.

Charters Towers (N.Q.) Jockey Club is offering
3000 sovs. in prizes for its next June meeting, the events
at which will comprise 8 handicaps —1 of £6OO, 1 of £5OO,
1 of £250, 2 of £2OO, and 3 of £150; and 4 weight-for-age
races—£3oo, £2OO, £l5O, and £l3O. And a Towers paper,
the other day, had a foghorn of a growl about “ the
absolute dearth of cash on the Towers 1 ”

The Tas. handicapper made a mistake when he
dropped Mountaineer from Bst. 51b. in Hobart Cup to
7st. in Launceston Cup, as the son of Creswick easily won
the latter event, paying the good “ div.” of £l5 18s. for
10s. on the tote. Winner’s owner did not, however, profit
much by the victory, as this time there was no “ sweep ”
money on offer.

Dear Bulletin, —You probably have seeri, in a
recent issue of London Sketch, “Banjo” Paterson’s
verses entitled “RioGrande’s Last Race.” Did you notice
the accompanying pictures? Small wonder “Rio Grande”
came to bad grief. Any man who’d attempt to ride such
a moke as the Sketch artist portrays would be very
likely to break his (and the horse’s) neck before he got
round Randwick, or any other steeplechase-course ; the
average donkey is a more muscular animal than the
Sketch’s Rio Grande. The stone wall, over which the
horse smashed, is, in the picture, an obstruction such as
was never seen on either an English or Australian course.
Moreover, is it the setting sun or the rising moon that is
floating about on the horizon? Moon or sun— onp wonders
where the ambulance is. The verse is all right, being
written by a man who can ride just as veil as he can
write, but the picture is the work of a man who, presum-
ably, has seen neither Randwick nor Aintree ; whilst
Daimio was never the model from which he drew Rio
Grande.—Yours, Cuddy.
* * * *
Bruce Lowe’s breeding 1 theories are ridiculed by
“ Beacon ” Osborne, a veteran turt scribe, and owner,
ever so many years ago, of Abdel Kader, twice winner of
Liverpool Grand National, and nearly winner a third
time. Which recalls Lindsay Gordon’s lines —
“ A horse that at Warwick beat Birdlime and Yorick,
And gave Abdel Kader at Aintree nine pounds.”

Armstrong, said to be an Australian rider, upset
a hot favorite at Lirurfield, Eng., in the New Year’s Handi-
cap and scored on Lil 11., an 8 to 1 chance. Armstrong is
doing well here, writes a Bulletin correspondent.
* * * »
“ I have heard,” writes our London correspon-
dent, “ that Daimio, Ebor, and Norton have been ‘ pooled’
for their different events. There has been trouble with
the Nightingales, and the Australian horses are in Es-
cott’s charge—ari equally good trainer—and Hickey is
now the chosen pilot. At Windsor he scored twice —on
Ebor and Norton. It was the latter’s first win, though
the former has not been beaten in England over the big(?)
sticks. Daimio came in for much derision at Lingfield on
account of his ungainly appearance. The critics are
contemptuous of his ‘ first-three ’ chances in the Grand
National, but the average Englisher is always a visual
judge—good stuff under a plain exterior he understandeth
not.
* * * *
The Yankees are still nibbling in the papers
over Mr. Buckland’s challenge to trot any pacer or trotter
in the States with Fritz, but it is any odds the offer never
comes to anything, it being so improbable that the owner
of a horse of the value of a top-notcher in the States
would risk the'trip across. That Fritz would have a good
show of annexing the stakes there can be little doubt. In
1885 Maud S. trotted a mile in 2.8 J in a big-wheeled sulky
on an oval track, and many American horsemen consider
the go equal to any performance since, taking the sur-
roundings into consideration. Some of the latter-day
watch-breakers have tried under similar conditions, but
have invariably failed to put up Maud’s time. Taking
a line from this, it is an open secret that
Fritz can do better than 2.10 on our primitive
tracks, and if such be the case, what are the odds that a
Yankee, especially a daisy-cutting pacer, never used to
anything but a caretully-prepared kite-shaped track,
would put up a go over our comparatively lumpy course,
within six or seven seconds of the effort of his life, even
allowing he retained his American form this side of the
Pacific ?
Fritz holds the unique position of being appar-
ently the only horse in the world with a show against
American cracks. In Australia he stands alone America
could not find standing-room in a German 13,000-tonner
for all the horses they could send across to beat our next
best.
* * * *
Mao. and Tom, of N. Queensland, owners of the
crack racehorse Stumpy, were supposed to know a bit;
and their jockey, Jones, was supposed to know a smaller
bit. They raced Stumpy at , also at , and won
the big money at both places hands down ; but as they
didn’t get good odds, they suspected that their jockey
and his pals got on before them and made a haul. It was
decided that the best thing they could do was to get rid
of the jock. A week afterwards Stumpy was taken over
to a two days’ meeting about 35 miles off, at which place
Jones got the sack. Mac. and Tom agreed that if they
could not get big odds the first day they would stiffen the
horse and have a “go” the second day. Jones and co.,
knowing Stumpy was a “ dead cop,” put all their money
on him at long odds. When Mac. and Tom came to back
the horse only even money was offered, so they instructed
the new jock to “pull.” When Jones got wind of this
he went to the stewards and told them “ that he had
always ridden Stumpy in his former races, but that the
owners wanted him to run stiff to-day, and because he
wouldn’t they took him off and put this scoundrel on,
who was going to lose.” Some of the stewards had backed
Stumpy, so when they heard this from the honest jock,
they called the owners up before them and told them
that they knew they could win with Stumpy on per-
formances, and they must win, or the whole lot—horse,
jock, and all—would be sent up for life. The horse won
on both days. Jones and his crowd made a big rise, but
the owners, who paid all the exes., didn’t make what they
thought they would. Many of those connected with the
turf in S.Q. most likely know who this jockey is.

“The Essex hounds,” writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, “ were followed recently by a she-
cyclist who, despite a couple of falls and ragged hedges,
was in at the death and the recipient of the brush. This
was the last straw necessary to break the back of the bike-
boom in English society. The ‘ repose that stamps the
caste of Vere de Vere ’ was generally taken in a roadside
ditch after an unavoidable meeting with the village
butcher’s waggon when, for uncertain periods, stertorous
snoring replaced the hum of the wheel—though not the
extracted spokes. Otherwise proper, ‘ naice’girls found
their sacrifice of dignity for the delicious pleasures of
scorching cheaply and contemptuously valued at a ss.
fine by some prejudiced provincial ‘ beak ’ who ‘ had
never heard of “ parrh ”!! 1 ’ Now ‘Bally’ Hooley, the
new millionaire, threatens to bring the bike to a ‘ fiver,’
so next summer society intends to resume its position of
shuttlecock to an equine battledore in the Row', and ban
the bike.”

Dear Bulletin, —You are out by not quite a
foot when you say that the biggest horse ever knowm was
exhibited in London just 50 years ago, he measuring 20
hands 1 inch. In the Dime Museum in the Bow'ery, New
York, about 1878 or ’9, I saw a horse w'hich measured 22
hands, and a bullock (ox as he was there called) measuring
19 hands, and neither of them caused much commotion,
so they may not even be the largest. And, re cream-
colored horses being short-lived, what sort of a pheno-
menon is this ? Till recently there was in an Ipswich (Q.)
municipal paddock (rented annually to the highest
bidder) where beasts were kept on agistment, a horse of
the color mentioned, which had been left there some 20
years previously by a traveller, and never claimed. He
was at last sent adrift by a lessee who thought more of
the grass than the ancient crock, which, upon thus re-
ceiving the “cold shoulder,” died wdthin about 10 or 12
yards of the paddock-fence, of shock to the system.—X.

match last Saturday, and to-day it was on 4 o’clock when
the game was resumed. Even then the North skipper
was not anxious to play, as the rain had made the field

A curious bike accident happened in Flinders-
street, Melbourne, the other day. New blocks had been
laid down over half of the road approaching the viaduct,
and laborers were busy pouring warm tar over these,
when, just as opportunely as these things happen in
manufactured jokes, a popular local barmaid, bloomered
and astride a bike, trying to dodge a rush of traffic, struck
the barricade, and shot off her machine, plump upon the

A weird combination of Melb.’s Very Nicest
youths is the Savage Cycle Club, a body which none but
the upright may enter, for the handlebars of all members’
machines are fixed on the same altitude as their chins.
The Savage Club takes long runs (maximum distance, 4
miles) every Saturday afternoon, and a destination is in-
variably chosen which gives the muscular Savages the
advantage of the wind. Then, with brake windguards and
gearcase on each jigger, they form a most impressive spec-
tacle as they pedal off at a terrific bat of a mile in 15min.
On reaching their destination the rest of the day is spent
in merry-go-round rides, &c. How the Savages return to
town is unknown, for nobody has ever seen any member
riding back against the wind, but it is believed that a
van calls at 5 p.m. and collects the bikes, while the
athletic owners take the homeward tram. The organ of
the sassiety cyclist recently thus reported an outing of
the club : —“Savage Bicycle Club.—This club had a very
enjoyable run to St. Kilda on Saturday, about 15 members
participating. The uniform of the club—velvet jacket and
old-gold cummerbund—was generally admired.”

A Martin-Lesna match is projected, and, if it
comes off, should return a bigger gate than any Austra-
lian cycle-meet yet held. However, if the League be not
reconstructed in time, patronage to any more matches will
be very hard to get.
The reconstruction of the L.V.W. should do
much good in weeding that unwieldy body of the spouting
bores that infest it. At present the Council is composed
of as many elected members as club delegates. The
multiplication of clubs has caused the inflation of the
League Council until it now numbers over 60 members,
every one of whom deems it his bounden duty to orate at
every chance.
The proposal is that the Council shall consist
of 25 members, all elected, and that club delegates be
abolished. Out of this 25, seven would be appointed as a
board to hear appeals, so that at any rate a repetition of
the Martin fiasco could not take place.

The Melb. shopkeepers who tried to combine
bike agency with other incompatible business, are already
biting their fingers. Very few have any idea of running
the trade, and the outside public looks with a certain
amount of suspicion on the man who deals sausages and
jiggers out of the same window.
H. S. Allen, the unknown Adelaide boy, who
ran away with the Adelaide Wheel Race from 300yds.,
seems to be the makings of a top-notcher. Iri the third-
class handicap same day he started from 80 y .rds behind
scr., owing to his penalty, yet he won his heat brilliantly,
and ran into second place in the final. No more 300 yards
for Mr. Allen.

The undeniable Porta walloped both Bilmartin
and Lesna in the 10-mile championship, and the poor per-
formance of the Frenchman in his first real race on Aus-
tralian soil only reiterates the cycling truism that a
record-breaker is not a racer. Yet, “on the continong,”
Lesna was a tip-top competition man.

The stories, told in court, re the arrest (with
violence) of pugilist Buck bv a couple of Melbourne con-
stables, amount to a disgrace to the force. Buck’s crime,
apparently, was his outspoken contempt for the “officers,”
who at once proceeded to justify the man’s sneers by
bashing him with their handcuffs.

Dear Bulletin, —Re the L.V.W. handicapping
controversy. “McG.’s” opponent is wroth because
W. J. C. Elliott and Fisher got 20yds. better start in the
A.N.A. than in the Austral and didn’t win. But look at
the number of good men who were advanced in equal or
more degree and also didn’t win. There was Porta 20yds.
better, Parsons 30, McDonell 30, Boidi 50, A. A. Middleton
20, J. Carpenter 20, McLean 25, A. H. Clinton 20, Fitz-
Gerald 30, N. Matterson 20, Gerster 50; I redale 35, Hickox
40, Garguewich 20, &c., &c., &c., until we get Nolan and
W. C. Elliott advanced 80yds. Tebbutt was propor-
tionately advanced from 190 to 210 (that is 20), but
“McG.’s” opponent calls this 30. Why were all these
advanced? Because Kellow won the Austral with re-
markable ease off 15yds.—that is, 35yds. further back
than the mark from which he had just previously won the
M.B.C Plate. And as 20+15 = 35, and as Kellow was
brought back only to scratch, what was left for the handicap-
pers but to advance the other men 20yds. or more, so as to
give them a chance of winning from the victor of the
Austral? With regard to Prowse, Jackson, and J. E.
Clinton : Those men were penalised in the A.N.A., and
why? Because between the Austral and the A.N.A.
Prowse won the 2nd and 3rd class handicap off 35yds. at
the Martin-Parsons meeting ; because Jackson won the
i-mile and 2-miie handicaps at Talbot Sports on Boxing
Day, and up to that time had “ started 14 times and won
12 ” ; because J. E. Clinton won the IJ4-miles 2nd and 3rd
class handicap at Bendigo on Boxing Day. Shouldn’t
winners be penalised by handicappers ?—Yours, Spectator.

Interesting to naturalists. At Torrens Creek

they eat little else, and even young, unbroken horses in

GENERAL DEBILITY
and Indigestion
Made Her Life Miserable, but She is
Cured by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Bead the testimony of Mrs. E. G.
Monro, Coburg, Victoria, whose por-.
trait is also given:
.A
“Some few years ago I suffered
terribly with indigestion and gen-
eral debility. I could not sleep,
and my condition was such as to
make my life miserable. None of
the many remedies I tried did me
any good, and I despaired of ever
getting better. One of my friends
told me of the blood-purifying and
strength-giving properties of Ayer’s
Sarsaparilla, and I began taking it.
Before 1 had finished the first bottle
I felt better, and was thus encour-
aged to give the medicine a thorough
trial. In all I used four bottles,
and then was perfectly cured of the
grievous trouble which had afflicted
me. I now recommend, to anyone
suffering as I did.

Thus Baronet; Newnes’s Titbits of a recent
date:—
The common British hive-bee has so thriven in a wild
state in Australia, that colonists might now gather the
honey in tons, if it would pay to do so.
Titbits evidently is unaware that the kangaroo
has now been trained to gather all the wild honey
and stow it away in its pouch. When the pouch
is full, it returns to the head-quarters of the Kan-
garoo Wild Honey Gathering Association Limited,
where the honey is abstracted by one of the em-
ployes, and stored for export and home consump-
tion. An active and well-trained kangaroo can
bring as many as three or four pouchfuls in a
day. The profits of the association are enormous,
so much so that Parliament next session will be
asked to impose a stiff license-fee on kangaroos or
a royalty on the turnover of the K. W.H.G.A.
A son of St. Stead, sent out per Nineveh
to review Australia, has been seized and violently
vaccinated, and sent for three weeks’ sojourn in
the desolate Point Nepean (Vic.) quarantine
station. This will be “ a grand experience for a
young man,” as any particularly nasty engage-
ment is termed in a daily newspaper office. By
the way, with the same smallpox outbreak both
of the Melb. morning papers lost their shipping
reporters, who happened to have boarded the
infected vessel. The offices are understood (by
some malignant liar) to have immediately written
to the men to the effect that their annual two
weeks’ holiday would start from date, and deli-
cately suggesting that, as they would have to be
an additional week away from regular work, a
sketchy special article on “How it feels to be
Quarantined ” would not be inopportune.
One Patrick Casey wanted £l5 wages due
to him by the Queen Constance tributors (Mar-
eeba, N.Q.), and called at the liquidator’s office for
it. Liquidator refused. With a“ by this and by
that,” Pat thumped —the table I He was given in
charge, handcuffed all night, and fastened to a
ring in the floor of the lock-up. Next morning, he
was discharged with a caution. The Chow-wor-
shipping slaves of the North accept this sort of
chain-’em-up' tyranny with a meekness befitting
their grovelling kind. There will be nothing more
heard of the episode for some four months, after
which several Labor-members will breathe hard in
the Assembly for two or three hours, will fill
Hansard with pages of lurid wrath, will submit
to be snuffed out by Tozer, browbeaten by Byrnes,
and hiccoughed at by Nelson, and will afterwards
strut around the country bragging of their mighty
valor in the Kawse 1
There is a familiar wail in the leader
columns of Adelaide Chronicle for January 23.
The burden of it is that there is grievous danger
in S.A. federating without Queensland and Wes-
tralia to back it up, because otherwise it will be
manned down by the combined vote of Victoria
and N.S.W. Also, that the movement means the
practical absorption of S..A. by N.S.W. and Vic-
toria, and that these two provinces may quite
probably be combining to plunder S.A., and that
it should have guarantees for its safety before it
goes in, &c. All this is an exact repetition of the
wail of the Sydney importer about the alleged
allianceof Vic. and S.A. to plunder N.S.W. And
the Sydney provincialists likewise complain that
it isn’t safe for their province to go in without
Queensland to back it up against S.A. The value
of Queensland in the matter of backing up every-
body seems to have become very great all of a
sudden.
At Melbourne City Court, two swagmen,
charged with vagrancy, gave as their address,
“The Bush, Australia.” Which recalls the
“ Banjo’s ” drover, whose address was “Care of
Conroy’s sheep, along the Castlereagh. ”
Natives of the Mambare River, New
Guinea, bite the index finger of the right hand as
a manifestation of marvel at any wondrous sight

- - - MIRACULOUS CURES.
A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfahrie Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlhts, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not cn’y from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
worm, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Bundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “ Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ” Ihe
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.
HERR RASSMUSSEN’S

160 E!izabeth-st., Melb.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that a
" r '”rse of your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a
severe case of biliousness and nervousness. I may also
mention that several of my friends to whom I have re-
commended your remedies have derived great benefit
from them ; therefore, I consider you are deserving of
success, which I do most heartily wish you.—Yours grate-
fully, A. HARRIS, J.P.
Nervousness Cured.
The well-known and popular representative of the
Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman whose testimony carries
special weight, writes thus: To Hetr Rassmussen. —Dear
Sir,—l think it my duty to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Vitality Pills acted very beneficially on my
nervous system, and, in consequence, I have recom-
mended them to many friends, who have all been cured
by their use.—Yours, R. A. LUCKHAM.

Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear sir,—lt gives me great pleasure to inform you that
I have derived great benefit from your celebrated Alfaline
Remedies during my exploring expeditions throughout
Australia, and I consider them invaluable to all travellers
in the bush.—Yours very truly, B. HUTTON

street, Melbourne.
Mr. Button writes later:—‘‘The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a waggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”
A Lady’s Testimonial.
It gives me great pleasure to inform you that your
celebrated Alfaline Pills oured me, when all other reme-
dies and doctors failed, of a stubborn case of Debility of
18 years’ standing. Dear Sir, I shall recommend your

writing to me will have full particulars.—l am, yours

Skin and Blood Cured.
Canning Mills, Canning, Western Australia.

Pills completely cured me. Previous to taking your
Blood Pills, I was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better ; and I shall never regret
trying your Alfaline Pills, as they had a wonderful effect
on my complaint, which several of my work-mates can

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, —In the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney T had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw' a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of jour
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir, —j hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer
from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading
doctors both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for
after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies I am now
completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recom-
mend your remedies to anyone suffering as I was.
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

reagh-st., Sydney.
A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J- KILLERIDGE,
h Lucisnow, N.S.W.
A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal bind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.
—Yours truly,

REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
The Australian Press has fully recognised the noble
mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise bestowed upon
him from this important source has not only been most
whole-hearted, but also very generous. Our space will
not permit to repeat one-tenth of his best Press notices,
but the following will suffice to show the public the esti-
mation in which Herr Rassmussen is held by the Austra-
lian Press :
Sydney ltulletin. —“Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing

mussen is a clever botanist.”

colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”
Flashes (Society Paper), Brisbane, Q.— “ Herr Rass-
mussen’s labors have resulted in a manner most gratifying
to himself, inasmuch as he has received the highest re-
cognitions of the most important scientific authorities.”
Chemist and Druggist .Journal, Melbourne.—

Bourke-street, Melbourne, and his Alfaline Pills will pro-

New South Wales.”

has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanical remedies.”

known not to r quire any additional praise from Truth.
His remedies are simply wonderful.”
Sunday Times. Sydney.—“lt may not be out of
place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for over ten years.”
N.Z. Mail, Wellington.—“We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rasmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist of
Sydney.”
The Australian Workman, Sydney.—“ Having
seen and examined letters from all parts of the w’orld, we
are assured that Herr Rassmussen’s Alfaline Remedies
have saved a world of suffering, and his remedies have
cured many people of complaints which were held to be
incurable.”
The Nord Australischc Zeitung, Brisbane.—“We
speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-
amined letters from all parts of the world, we are satisfied
that he is deserving of universal thanks.”
Australian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.”
The above selected Press opinions are quite sufficient
to show the esteem Herr Rassmussen is held in by those
who have the best opportunity to watch his career.

Actual Fact!
A leading Sydney lawyer called on us and stated that after a very merry night he felt
so bad and sick the next morning it was necessary to see his doctor. The doctor advised
him to go straight to FISHER & CO’S and get a draught of their KOLA NUT TONIC.
In half-an-hour he was bright and fresh enough to conduct an important law case, which
meant £250 to him. He is quite positive it would not have been done without the Tonic.
The gentleman naturally will not have his name mentioned in the papers, but it can be
made known privately. This gentleman is most enthusiastic in his praise of KOLA NUT
TONIC, and will now have no other medicine.

PUBLIC NOTICC.
We hereby give notice that any doctor, chemist, or any
other person making false statements regarding FISHER
and CO.'s Famous “KOLA NUT TONIC” will he pro-
ceeded against according to law. This tonic is faithfully
made from pure African Kola Bean, imported by us, and
ground on our premises. It is the finest and most re-
freshing and sustaining Tonic known. We are the only
chemical firm holding a stock of African Kola Nuts ; we
have bought all obtainable in Melbourne, Adelaide, Bris-
bane, and Sydney, and besides the shipments now on the
water we have cabled to London for another half-ton.
The nuts can be seen in our window whole or ground into
powder ready for maceration, and yet there are liars who
will spread the report that we do not use Kola Nuts.
This TONIC acts with the most remarkable rapidity in
restoring a weakened Stomach, Impaired Digestion,
Torpid Liver, Debility, and in Reviving the Brain from
the effects of Overwork and Fatigue. It stimulates and
strengthens the entire Muscular System, acting like
magic and rouses into Vigor and Health the whole Phy-
sical Energy of the Human Economy'. To enable one to
enjoy a meal, a dose taken an hour or so before immensely
sharpens the appetite. With Soda Water, Before Break-
fast, is the most beneficial drink in the world. It has a
most marvellous effect in Checking the Craving for Drink,
in many cases having restored Drunkards to their Normal
Conditions of Life.
North Sydney, June 26, 1896.
Messrs. FISHER and CO.
Gentlemen,— I cannot speak too highly of your excel-
lent preparation of KOLA NUT. As a tonic I found it
far superior to anything of the kind I ever used, and
have strongly recommended it to several friends all of
whom (after taking it) are enthusiastic in th»ir praises of
it. Kola Nut Tonic has a most beneficial effect after an
attack of influenza ; on some of my acquaintances it has
produced w'onde.ful effects, particularly in strengthening
the muscles of the chest and limbs. Many of my cyclino-
friends swear by it. I notice its use has been adopted by
the Alpine Club as a STIMULANT and NUTRIENT in
mountain-climbing expeditions, etc., as it greatly ’in-
creases the power of the lungs, and keeps off muscular
fatigue, and will prove invaluable to athletes. I feel
confident Kola Nut Tonic will have a large consumption,
for those who once try it will always keep it in store.
Yours faithfully,
CHARLES WISEHEART, Willoughby.
h, A . C tF? N THE HEART.—Professor Heckel states
that Kola, by the Caffeine and Theobromine which it con-
tains, is a tonic of the heart, whose pulsation it acceb r-
ates, while it increases its power and regulates its
contractions. Professor Heckel turther points out that
the principle, called Kolaine, contained in Kola, prevents
rapid waste of the tissues during fatiguing exertions,
whiter the Caffeine stimulates the muscles.
PNEUMONIA.—Worry kills business men. Heavy
losses and hard times make them depressed in spirits.
Ihe brain and body become weak ; unknown to them they
are debilitated. It is then that the least chill strikes
them, and pneumonia carries them off. To fortify the
system and make Ihespirils buoyant, nothing can equal
Fisher and Co. s famous Kola Nut Tonic. It is the most
remarkable invigorator and sustaiiier known.
DIARRHCEA. —Dr. Durian and Dr. Cunio have both
reported cures in rebellious diarrhoea under the use of
Kola,
A recent issue of the Planter’s Monthly contains a
description of this remarkable Nut and its uses Kola
has the property of staying hunger, whilst supporting the
struggle for existence. If a supply of nuts had been in-
chined in Mr. Stanley's outfit, his men would not have
suffered so terribly for want of animal food. As might
be expected, Ihe value of Kola increases as it makes its
way into the interior of Africa, and some of the tribes
furthest removed from the sea pav for the dry powder
an equal weight of gold-dust. In a despstch from Mr.
George Alexander Stevens, Her Majesty’s Consul at
Kama, he calls attention to the great powers of endurance
in lifting heavy loads and transporting them to longdis-
tances in the tropical climate, at tributed to the free use
of Kola Bean. An old African, after biting a pieoe of
the magic bean, lifted 179 English pounds weight on to
his head and carried the same for a distance of four
miles.
. “Still another merit is named, however, which will
1^ t f r w t r t u etf ' mper ? nce P arly ’ The negroes who chew
Kola Nut have no desire to drink rum, and hence save
money and retain strength.**
Dr. LEON ERNST MONNET, Paris, reportsl gave
a strong infusion of Kola Nut to a railroad track-layer
who was suffering from ‘blue devils’ (hypochondria)
extremely, and within two hours he felt like" going to his
hard duties, and laughed and talked.”
A woman—whose name under the circumstances can-
not be given —came into our shop the other day, with
tears of gratitude in her eyes, and said; “My husband
used to come home on Saturdays DRUNK, hut he has
been taking KOLA NUT TONIC for four weeks, and now
comes home quite sober, and places the whole of his
wages in my hands. God bless you.**

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing oough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion jn the throat, and giving strength to the .voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE. —Dear Sir, —Your medicine ha»
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 montha
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. 1 tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronohitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly' and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

“ If I were asked which single medicine I should

others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”

The wife of W. J. Bryan, the unsuccessful
candidate for the U.S. Presidency, was the first
woman admitted to practice in the Nebraska
courts. She has never appeared in any case, and
only qualified herself as a lawyer to assist her
husband in his profession. Bryan’s father, Silas
L. Bryan, was for six years a Circuit Court Judge.
He used to open his court with prayer, and always
asserted that the Lord assisted him in his
decisions. More than once, when in doubt during
a trial, he was known to kneel down on the bench
and ask Divine guidance. One day, just after the
Supreme Court had overruled six of his decisions,
a lawyer, meeting him in the street, said : “ I see,
Judge, that the Supreme Court has reversed the
Lord in six cases. What have you got to say
about that ? ” Judge Bryan immediately replied :
“ The Supreme Court is wrong.” Which recalls
the story of the N.S.W. District Court Judge
who, after giving a decision, remarked : “ That’s
my opinion ; but I have no doubt it will be re-
versed if it goes on appeal to three technically-
minded Irishmen.”

Billy Little, when M.P. for Woothakata
(N.Q.), once denied the impeachment of having
engaged in a game of “ threepenny Nap ” in the
precincts of “ the House,” in these terms : “ As
a member of this House, I strive to conduct my-
self like a gentleman. On my political honor,
at the time referred to I was not playing three-
penny Nap. I was absent at a dog-fight.”
A really learned N.S.W. Judge tells a
story of himself. Shortly after his elevation to the
bench he was spending a few days in an up-
country village called Hat Hill, and, disgusted
to find that a stray pony, which could open any
gate in the village, had taken a fancy to the
shrubs in his front garden, determined to see if
something could not be done to put an end to the
animal’s depredations. Taking a stroll one morn-
ing before breakfast, he met the local police-
sergeant, and complained about the pony. ‘‘Can’t
help it, sir,” said Robert, who did not know his
Honor. “ Why ?” asked the Judge. “You can
put him in the pound.” “Got no power to, sir,”
was the answer. “Oh, yes, you have,” said the
newly-elevated one. “Down at Bunker’s Hill,
where I live, the police impound stray cattle.”
This was the sergeant’s opportunity; drawing
himself to his full height, and punctuating his re-
marks by punching the palm of his left hand with
his right fist, he replied : “ Now, if you knew the
law, which, of course, you don't, you’d know that
Bunker’s Hill is a municipality and Hat Hill is
not. And that is the difference between Bunker’s
Hill and Hat Hill.”
The only map showing glaciation on the
Tas. West Coast, compiled by T. B. Moore, was
forwarded by him recently to Prof. Baron von
Lendenfeld. It will be published in the forth-
coming work on glaciation, at which the eminent
Austrian scientist has been engaged for many
years. Moore is practically the father of the
West Coast, nearly all mountains, lakes, and
rivers having been named by him after well-known
geologists. His connection with the Coast dates
back over 20 years.

“With the End of Love—the End
of Life.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They had had a row the night before, and
this morning Sally sat on the top rail of the cattle-
yard fence, chewing between her crooked teeth a
sweet white root of grass.
George came dustily along in his shabby leg-
gings, with a deep crease knotting the flesh between
his eye-brows. He passed her without any show
of recognition, but dropped as though by accident
a dirty wisp of screwed-up paper at her feet, which,
as soon as the low, iron shoulder of the stables
hid him from sight, she turned over lazily with
the toe of her boot.
Then, with a sudden movement of her hand, she
stooped down and picked it up and thrust it hastily
into the bosom of her dress.
She spat out the grass, walked over to an empty
chaff-box, sat down, and smoothed out the dirty
slip of paper.
There was, as she expected, writing on it:
Big up-and-down letters scrawled in heavy plum-
bago and utterly devoid of capitals.
"'yawn ter creek ter drownd meself .”
Sally’s eyes twinkled, and opening her mouth
wide to the blue sky she laughed aloud.
“ Creek's all dried up,” she giggled, and pucker-
ing up her lips blew the loose chaff into the air.
* * » *
The sun crawled up a little higher and she
heard a shuffling footstep come along the ridge at
her back. She didn’t turn. She knew it was
George by the sound of his walk.
It was really “ great.” Wouldn’t she jeer him !
The noise of creaking boots came larger to her
ear and then changed close behind to the nervous
rap-tap of a whip-handle against leggings.
“ Well,” she said, “did yer enjoy yer swim?”
Silence followed, then a dry cough.
“ Well, was it wet, anyhow ? ”
An answer came.
“ George ’as cut 'is throat
She wheeled round.
It was the overseer.

Governor Musgrave was once studying
primitive life in Central Queensland, and fell into
a township west of Rockhampton, where he had
to (face the usual ball and banquet. The M.C. at
the ball was a Tipperary man who kept a local
bootshop. A “leading citizen”—the P.M. intro-
duced him to the Governor. He spat on his hand,
gave it a slap on his thigh, and said “ Putt it thar,
yir Ixcilliney ! ” A minute later he observed :
“Gan I selict a partner for your Highness?”
Musgrave modestly replied that he was too old
now for any festivities of that kind. “The divil
a bit of it ! ” said the M.C. with great animation ;
“ be the holy jabers ’Oi wouldn’t trust ye with
my ould woman at the prisint toime ! ” Then the
solemn Sir Anthony gazed far off into blue im-
mensity, walked feebly into the refreshment-room,
and absent-mindedly drank rum in mistake for
sarsaparilla. A little later in the evening, when
some of the guests were disposed to defy the
ruling of the M.C., a humorous person walked up
to him and remarked: “Your proper policy is
one of laissez faire 1 ” To which the M.C. re-
plied : ‘ Can’t yez see that’s what I’m dooin’ ?
Sure, haven’t I chucked six of the out
alriddy! ”

After Griffith introduced his Elementary
Property Law of Queensland, in 1890, a severely
sarcastic and destructive criticism was published
and issued in pamphlet form, the writer adopting
the pen-name of “Cassandra.” For some time
Griffith credited the pamphlet to a writer to whose
style it bore some resemblance, and not for long
after did he discover that the author was J. J.
Kingsbury, then M.L.A. for Brisbane. J.K.
sniffed red-headed anarchy and fire-eyed desola-
tion to capital and “propputy ”in every clause of
the Act; among the first missiles he heaved the
following bomb-shell: —
As wise as were the citizens of Troy in passing within
their walls the wooden horse filled with elements of de-
struction, just so wise would be any legislature which
might pass this innocent, wooden-looking Act, replete as
it is with covert weapons of socialism.
Now Griffith is on the Bench, and J.K. at the
Bar, and the Act of the one and the wild-eyed,
Cassandraic prophecies of the other are already as
a tale that was told by some unrecorded narrator
in a long-forgotten age.

An old blackfellow on the Annan River
favored me with his solemn belief that the ticks
were sent by the souls of departed blaeks to punish
the bad squatters who had helped to reduce the
aboriginal population. I suggested that this was
hardly fair to the good squatters, but he said he
had only seen two, and they were dead ! This
Myall philosopher further told me that white men
and women wear clothes merely because there are
very few fit to be seen without them. And it did
seem to me that a modern city population, if com-
pelled to parade for one day without any clothes,
would afford a spectacle unprecedented on this
planet! This subject offers a fine, open plain for
the imagination to canter over.

The maid is a squatter’s daughter, and the
false lover is also a custodian of many jumbucks.
He had wooed and won in the same old style, and
gave her the same old precarious assurance that
death was the only barbed-wire fence that would
ever make two paddocks in their united souls, or
a squatter lover’s words to that effect. But his
visits to Brisbane grew more and more frequent,
for a civil-servant’s daughter, an ox-eyed Juno
with a spider-waist, had enslaved his inconstant
heart, and he slighted his western maid as
“ Theseus once in Dia forgot his beautiful-haired
Ariadne.” The deserted one waited patiently to
get a correct measure of her lover’s deception.
For a time she laughed as it ate into her heart
like the fox in the bosom of the Spartan youth,
and then love gave place to a measureless contempt.
Then she went on a visit to Brisbane, chiefly to
see the one who supplanted her. She saw her in
Queen-street, and also in the Turkish bath ! The
wasp-waisted society-girl and the robust, deep-
chested daughter of the plains met in puris
naturalibus. On her return to the station, she
sent the false one a brief note :“I have seen your
favorite filly, and am afraid she is only a weed
sure to throw bad stock, especially to a worthless
sire. I use this language, as it is the only kind
you are likely to understand.” Then she felt
better.

Melbourne Age, on the self-sacrificing
character of its beautiful commercial world since
the banks reconstructed :
In many cases English investors have called in their
loans, and their demands have had to be met in order to
preserve our good name. With a courage altogether
admirable, citizens have set themselves to the task of
private retrenchment in order to spare cash to meet thes»
obligations.
Premier Turner says that, should the Con-
vention movement be a failure, he will spread him-
self on the job of resuscitating the Federal Council.
“ Resuscitate ” means to bring back to life, and all
the life the Federal Council ever had is not worth
bringing back. A completely new institution
might be built on the ruins, but that is quite a
different thing. It would be practically the
same process as that by which you can turn
an old shirt into a new suit of clothes; you
take the last remaining button off the shirt
and sew the suit on to it, and then, when
the clothes have settled down into their new
position, you cut off the button and throw it away.
The button preserves the continuity of things, but
otherwise there is no relationship.
“Breaking It Gently,”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An elderly lady sat near me in a ferry-boat one
evening lately, and seeing that I sympathetically
noticed her tear-wet face, hitched over and im-
parted her distressing confidences.
“ I was a widdy,” she said, “ wid a bit o’ money
an’ as happy as needs be. But I changed me life
las’ week. The man was a widdyer, a mature,
up-standin’ fella, fairly well off, as he told me, wid
a nice house an’ a purty garden a mile out o’
Sydney. I could understan’ he were lonely, for
although happy as I said, I were lonely now an’
again meself. Anyways, I agreed to marry ’im,
an’ after the marriage we went out in a ’bus to his
nice home.”
Here the lady rubbed her eyes and bit her
nether lip viciously.
“It were a nice home, I admit,” she went on,
“ but jus’ when I sot down to look roun’ me he
sneaked up to me with a monkey grin, an’ what
d’ye think he said ? ”
“ Something complimentary, no doubt.”
“No. What he said was : ‘Pardon me, dear
Charlotte, for not tellin’ you afore. I have a
couple o’ childer. They are next door. Can I go
for ’em ? ’ That’s what the wagabone said. I felt
as if goin’ to faint, for if there’s one thing I hate
it’s brats. Howiver, I tried to smile, an’ off he
skipped.”
“ Well ? ”
“ He come back wid tree. * I thought you said
a couple,’ I remarked, pressin’ me hear wid me
right han’. ‘Yis, yis ; so I did,’ he muttered,
dippin’ his head an’ simperin’ monkey-like, ‘ but
this,’ pointin’ to the youngest, ‘is a wery little one.’
Just imagine me state. There I wus wid the care
o’ a family thrown on me, widout the laste regard
for mefeelin’s.”
“ It was hard.”
“ Wait. I had only me hat off, when he sidled
back again from that neighbor’s house wid two
more kids.”
“ His also ? ”
“ Yis. An’ before I had me gloves off he fetched
in two more.”
“ That was seven ! ”
She laughed wrathfully.
“ Add two more to that! ” she cried. “ It’s
gospel truth, mister ; that deceitful oul’ wagabone
wus the father o’ nine childer—as ugly a swarm o’
dirty-faced crabs as eyes ever lit on.”
“ Get someone to look after them.”
“ But he lied about his money, too, an’ the
furniture’s on time payment.”
“ It seems a bad case.”
She leaned over and whispered : “ I’m goin’ for
a sepyration an’ 10s. a week alimony. ”
“ Will he give it ? ”
“ If he won’t I’ll bring me five childer from
Melbourne.”
“ Then you have five ? ”
“ Yis; but I hate childer, an’ me two married
sisters are rearin’ them. I’ll take them in be de-
grees, as he did, an’ give ’im to feel some of me
own terrible sorra. When he brought in his ninth
an’ I lay back for a bout o’ hysterics, d’ye know
what the wagabone said ? ‘ I broke it gintly to
you, Charlotte dear, didn’t I ? ‘ That's whac the
wagabone said. An’ I’ll break it gently to him,
the same way.”
She drew herself back and added : “ Thankee,
sorr, for yer kindly adwice. Something told me I
could trust to ye to put me on the right track. I’ll
folly yer directions to the letter an’ ’ll trate the
oul’ wagabone exactly as ye’ve p’inted out.”

A MERCANTHE HERO.
The city man cried —“O, Mong Doo ! ”
(His anguish into French went) —
“The blessed Court I must go through
Unless—l try retrenchment;
My little schedule I must file
Ere cash-up time commences,
Or shall I live in modest style,
And cut down home expenses ? ”
He turned the matter in his mind
Whilst smoking in the garden ;
One moment he felt half inclined
To fail, and pay a “ farden,”
Emerging from the crisis rich
And free of obligation.
(Sing hey ! the good old “ farden ” which
Was other men’s salvation.)
Next moment, though, he kissed his wife
And cried, “My dear Priscilla,
We’ll flee our present mode of life
And buy a ten-roomed villa ;
I’ll not go broke. Despite the pain
Of sneers from Mrs. Grundy ;
I’ll curb my taste for dry champagne,
Except, perhaps, on Sunday.”
They sold the buggy and the pair
Of fifty-guinea horses ;
They dined content on frugal fare—-
Three inexpensive courses.
They sent the servant-girl out late
For job-line goods to forage—
In point of fact, they met their fate
With Admirable Courage.

Pink pills
Effect cures in cases to a
WILLIAMS’
- Pale people
11 human appearance incurable.
A NEWTOWN CASE.
SHE SUEEERED EOR NINETEEN
: YEARS.
The truest of axioms remarks that there is no smoke without fire,
and whenever the public talk in warm and appreciative terms of
the benefit they have derived from the use of some specific, there
is always certain to be clear and honest evidence behind to prove
these words.
Hearing in especial of a local cure which had, amongst number-
less others, been effected by the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for. Pale People, a reporter was despatched to the residence of the
patient in question to personally investigate the case.
Mrs. Evans is the lady’s name, and her home is situated at
No. 105 Mary-street, Newtown, near St. Peter’s.
When we entered we were met by a bright and cheerful
woman, past middle age, but still wearing on her face the signs of
recent illness and departed pain.
We explained our mission.
‘Oh,” she said, “sit down by the window there. I’ll tell
you all you want to know—and more besides,” she added cheerily,
“ about the marvellous change that has taken place in my condi-
tion entirely since I began taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills.”
“You had previously been an invalid, had you not?” we
asked.
“ Yes,” she replied, “ I am a widow, and the mother of twelve
children, and for nineteen years I have suffered intensely from the
after effects of rheumatic fever.”
“ And now?”
“ Ah ! ” she said, shaking her head, and smiling, “ I am much
better now.”
“ How did you first hear of the pills, then ? ”
“ Well, a man left a pamphlet at my door, issued by the Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills Company, and I read it, and was struck by
a case in it similar to my own in which a cure had been effected.”
“ Did you get a box ? ”
“Yes, I got a box, and just took the pills about the end of
November or the beginning of December.”
“ And the improvement? ”
“ It dated gradually from that date, and as I took each box I
could feel myself perceptibly growing better, until to-day I’m a
changed woman to what I was two months ago.”
“ Were you very bad then ? ”
“Yes. Before I began taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills I
couldn’t move my shoulder, neck, arms or hands. I couldn’t think
of using the sewing machine. Now I turn the wheel quite easily
with my hand ; but before that I couldn’t lift it from my side.
Look what I’ve done with the machine, thanks to the pills.” And
she showed us a number of ladies’ articles profusely ornamented
with fancy stitching and frills of deft embroidery. Each stitch
was white and regular, and each curve cut with the nicest atten-
tion to detail.
“ You know I earn my living by this,” she said, looking up,
“and I’d be thankful for more customers. But before I took Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills I could no more think of using the machine
than I could of flying.”
“ Did you try much medicine before you bought the pills ? ”
“ Yes, continually for 19 years, and I could swim,’’she added,
reminiscently, “in all the linimepts and stuff I’ve taken. Bottle
after bottle —one thing followed another—and there seemed to be
no end to it.”
“ Didn’t you try the hospitals ? ”
“ Yes. I tried them all; but after I’d been at each place a
while they all declared me incurable. Why, I walked into the
Sydney Infirmary in Macquarie-street, but it did me no good, and
I had to be carried out.”
“ And you have had private doctors, I suppose ?”
“Yes, I have. Plenty of them—and too many,” she re-
marked, with a laugh. “ But it was no good. After they’d
treated me a bit they all told me the same : ‘lt’s no use,’ they
said. ‘ You’ll never get better. We can’t do any more for you.’
So I wasted my money year after year. One doctor recommended
me to go into the hospital, and have my sinews cut. But I
wouldn’t agree to that.”
“ Then you ascribe the improvement in your condition abso-
lutely to the use of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills ? ”
“Yes, absolutely,” she replied. “I have taken seven
boxes by now, and I’m using my eighth. And I intend to
keep on using them. They’re the only thing I’ve ever had that
have done me any good, and I can’t be too thankful to them. I
believe absolutely in theni.”
“ Why, look,” she added, quickly, as she raised her arms
and pinned her collar with the greatest ease. “ I could not raise
my hands from my waist before I took the pills, and was thorough-
ly useless. Now I can earn my own living. And the awful pains
from my neck and chest and shoulders have all gone away I
never feel them a bit now. Though in the old days,” and she
gave a little shiver at the recollection, “if I made the slightest
move sharp pains would dart all through my neck and shoulders.”
“Your case is exceedingly interesting.”
“Yes. Do you know that there are about 150 people who
have heard of me and are watching my case ? I’m a great object
of interest to the neighborhood, and as I get well others who’re
also suffering are taking the pills, and I recommend them strongly

The Honeymoon Train .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like a horse that tugs at the rein
The power in the steam-chest swings,
And its pent-up strength is pain
The while the injector sings.
Loose me ! the rod and the gear
Are ready and ripe for play ;
On the bright steel rail like a brazen spear
I shall flash to the mountains to-day.
The steam in my copper veins,
And rivet, and rod, and band,
Work to the driver’s guiding reins—
Bend to the master’s hand.
Lemans are rivet and crank to the steam,
For the steam is the loco.’s lord,
And he throws to the world but a careless gleam
As he flashes the track like a sword.
There’s a rush of a wheel and a roar
And the tang of a loosened rail,
A puff thro’ the joint of the furnace-door—
Starts the race of the Oupid mail !
Not a foot-plate jolts, though the train of love
Be run on a rocking road ;
The exhaust is white in a string above,
And light is the honeymoon load.
A swing on a curve, and a curve on a grade,
And all without using a spring,
Never break me down —there is none afraid—
Each wheel-hub works on a wing.
Though I live for love you must stoke me full;
I must eat if my love’s to last ;
Down the curve with a brake—up the grade with
a pull—
And the working world is passed.
Runs he for love, does the honeymoon train,
For the love and desire to run ;
Never was bed on which he hath lain,
Never his work is done.
Wooed by the wind that he calls as he passes ;
Taking the lauds of the swaying grasses ;
Love in his heart and power in his nerves,
Sweeping the levels and swinging the curves.
Pandar am I of the steel and the iron,
Pandar to love that is licensed, and lovers ;
Through the grey twilight my steam-pipes environ
Vague thoughts of the groom as each new charm
discovers.
I slip the false weight of my driving-wheel over,
I break the dead centre for love of a lover,
I slide down the grades, and I rush through the
sidings,
I slip in the cuttings and tell them the tidings.
I swing from a chair to the fish-plate that’s
loosing,
And rattle the lengths to a song of my choosing,
Npr slacken the rush till the great ascent’s over
And the gear of the signals is set to the lover.
And at Love’s great mountains I set down the
swain,
And the gate of his hope is the honeymoon train.

Probably the one man at Port Darwin,
when the cyclone struck it, whom nobody would
have regretted was the solitary leper at the local
lazar-house, but he escaped uninjured. His house
and everything else about him was blown away,
but the leper himself wasn’t even scratched.
Smoke-ho!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I hadn’t seen Deston for more than three years,
and when I stepped on to his verandah I naturally
expected the bloated heap in the hammock to
swing out and shake hands. He peeped at me
from under his fist, and oh, he was changed !
“ Your memory isn’t as good as it should be,”
said I.
The big, fat back of him squirmed in the net.
“ You’re Sam Byers, of the Hoogli: ’n’ what the
devil d’ye want in Queensland, Byers ? ”
The offensive way he squinted over his shoulder
made me feel mad, especially when I remembered
that it was 300 rupees of mine that helped him
from Calcutta to North Queensland. We were both
Hoogli pilot-men, although I will say that Deston
never had more than a Chinese notion of his busi-
ness—his piloting the Ganges on the Malabar
shoal proved that.
“ You’re very proud all of a sudden,” I rapped
out, ‘ ‘ of your few acres of cane, and your dirty
Kanaka shop!”
“ Byers,” said he, and the skin on his face shut
up like a concertina, “ go back to Calcutta ! ”
“ Thanks,” said I, “but this sugar racket’s good
enough for me. I’m taking up a few acres of land
to-morrow. How’s the labor-market, Jimmy ? ”
At first I thought it might be the 300 rupees that
troubled him, and said so, but he never shifted.
A big-chested islander grinned at me from the
verandah end ; I made a step forward with my
fists down until he blotted himself out in the scrub.
I didn’t like it, and, when I looked through the
ring of flies at Deston and remembered that he
had once worn clean clothes and taken in a paper,
I could have booted him round the old plantation.
“ Are you married ? ” I said.
He turned his scrubby face and blinked feebly.
“ She’s about the premises, ’n’ you needn’t go
nosing round, anyhow. Go back to Calcutta,
Byers.”
I swung out of that shop stamping the dirt off
my heels. Up and down the valley the wind was
singing in the tasselled cane, and all over the earth
there was a smell that made me feel glad. A
jungled cape at the valley-end almost shut out the
sea, but if you looked low down through the
smooth palm boles there was a bit of tide flutter-
ing up the sands like a wind-blown scarf. Passing
the rear of the house I came across another veran-
dah, and a woman’s sudden laugh brought me to
the half turn. I could see her shifting the hang-
ing creepers to get a peep.
“Mrs. Deston,” said I, loud enough to be heard,
and lifted my hat. She laughed, nodded, and
showed me a little more of herself. She was just
pretty enough to make you wink—full-lipped, big-
bosomed, and good-natured I guessed, with a
splendid pile of hair done up in neat double
hitches at the back. I was quick to see a man
skulking in the dark behind her—guess she’d be
shadowed by one wherever she went—and his long
fingers kept moving in and out of the light putting
little things down her back. She said something
that brought the beauty yawning into the open.
He was what you’d call “an Australian native
a shaky, lean-ribbed son of a gun. He smiled at
me shyly and pocketed his fists like a patron who
never puts ’em up to a friend.
“Good day,” said I.
“ Good day, boss,” said he and slouched heavily
to the nearest support. You’re leaning yourself
to death, Mr. Long, thought I, and that’s what’s
the matter. Two laughs followed me down the
track, and I knew that he was back to the veran-
dah again.
Like Deston, I selected a piece of country almost
shut in by hills, and the floor of the valley was
rich with black soil washed down by centuries of
rain. After sticking up a house and indenting
some patent ploughing-taekle from Brisbane, I
“let her go.” It took me six months to discover
that an experienced Hoogli pilot can’t farm sugar,
so I stopped suddenly and advertised for a scientific
partner; then dropped round to Deston’s place
to see if he was still above ground.
I found him cross-legged, reading a book on
cane. His face was clean and shaven, and the
white duck-suit he wore made a regular gentleman
of him again; I told him so. He stepped down
and nearly shook my arm off.
“ Glad to see you, Byers ; ’n’ you’ll have to ex-
cuse my want of civility the other day ; I was
down, clean down.”
“Hog fat, melancholia and dirt,” I explained.
“Expected to hear that you’d gone up aloft,
Jimmy, so I popped round to see Mr. Long doing
the heavy in your best clothes.”
“Who’s Mr. Long?” he shouted, swinging
round on me with two glasses and a bottle.
“Who the deuce is Mr. Long?”
“ Mr. Long lived on your back verandah,
Deston, and it struck me that he used to come
round at intervals and plug you because you were
the old man and a beastly nuisance. How’s the
missus ? ”
I never saw a man sit back and laugh like
Deston did —it split his brown face into a thousand
white cracks. He stopped short as he’d begun,
and whipped out his watch.
“ I make it 11, Byers ; how’s yours ? ”
“It’s just that,” said I, looking into his eyes.
He walked into the front room, calling me after
him. There was a long, narrow table at one end
and a single chair. On the hearth was a kerosene-
tin filled with water. He stirred up the embers,
briskly threw on some wood, and placed the tin on
top. Then he took a tiny bell from the table and
tinkled it for half a minute. I was looking out
from the window and saw the door of a shed
opposite open. A man and woman stole out, and,
by the way they covered their eyes from the sun,
I guessed it was a pretty dark place they were
leaving. Straight as a bolt they came, the woman
leading. Deston stood behind the square table, as
if he were going to sell something. He turned
half his face to me suddenly and threw out his
forefinger.
“ Look at ’em, Byers ; could you swear to ’em ?
That’s Mr. Long, as you call him; this is Lena
Deston. Isn’t she a beauty ? ”
The pair climbed up the steps gasping, as if
they had just run a mile. She stared at me,
frightened like, and put up her hands. Even then
I could see the loose flesh move over her cheek-
bone at every step. She laughed weakly, and
held to the table facing Deston. He stirred up
the fire once more.
“ Steady there, Lena. Keep your tail up,
Billy.”
Billy sat in the darkest corner. I had seen him
a month or two ago, and he was only a kid then ;
but this quaking thing in the shadow was an
elderly gent in dungaree pants, who’d evidently
been on a life-long razzle. Deston said it was Mr.
Long, and I have reasons for believing Deston.
He looked at the tin once, and it seemed to
frighten him.
The woman’s arms were pulpy and red. She
was holding to the table, watching Deston.
“You don’t want it done to-day, Jimmy;
don’t, for Christ’s sake ! Look.” She held up a
blistered arm. There was a fine grin on Deston’s
face ; he performed on the table like an auctioneer.
“ Take it or leave it, nobody’s forcing you.
Now, Billy, wake up, it’s 11 o’clock.” Billy shook
himself out of the corner and crawled to the fire-
place ; some of the steam came back on his face ;
he lifted his arm but it dropped again helplessly.
“ The dog’s frightened ! ” whispered the woman
hoarsely. “ Ugh ! ” She approached the fire
steadily, and thrust her arm into the singing
water.
“ Bravo ! ” shouted Deston, and moved slightly
from the jump-back and scream that followed.
She was holding a white ivory counter between her
finger and thumb.
“ Blank,” said Deston sympathetically. “Hard
moz, Lena ! You have a shot, Billy.”
The woman wept softly, backing to the door.
Deston turned to me confidentially :
“ She’ll come back; wait.”
They’re free agents, Mr. Deston, thinks I, or
I’d be kicking your ribs long ago. He was right ;
she came back, and the same thing happened,
only this time she whipped out a red ivory.
“ Brize,’’ said Deston cheerfully, and produced
a small tin box from a rusty safe. Billy crept
over and kissed her neck ; she never repelled him.
Jimmy handed her a pill-box which she hid in her
bosom quick as a conjuror.
“ What is it ? ” said I.
He turned and laughed.
“ Opium, and good stuff, too. Lilly ’U get his
whack although she’s fussing and hiding it. When
Billy gets it he sticks to it, I will say that about
him ; then she smells hell all day. Billy has some
good points though, he washes himself sometimes ;
Lena don’t! ”
They crawled back across the sunlit space, and
the man who six months ago looked fit to wallop
Peter Jackson pottered in her wake, holding fear-
fully to a bit of her ragged skirt. Deston watched
them from the window with a big cheroot between
his teeth.
“ Your study of revenge isn’t a very pretty one,”
I said.
He turned to me, and all the suppressed ferocity
had gone from his face, leaving it white and lean.
“No, it isn’t pretty, Byers; but they’re worth
seeing sometimes.”
