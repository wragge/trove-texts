Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumefl-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food,, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Heartburn, Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

The Red Page
Marie Pitt
Marie E. .1. Pitt has sung in many keys
and sung well. Her verse is ahvayS tuneful;
and on the ground of good craftsmanship
alone she deserves the good word of every
lover of the sweetly-fashioned lyric. But
there is a great deal more than good crafts-
manship in her work. Very few Australian
women have anything like her fooling for the
fine thing said in words that catch at the
heart; and there is often an intensity of
restrained emotion in her lines that brings
them very close to the ultimate possibility
of expression. Her Poems (Edward A.
Vidler, Melb.) have just been collected in a
rather large volume ; and many ,readers .will
be surprised at the quality of sustained
effort shown in the book. Opened at any
page there is always something which
attracts and arrests; and often the lyrical
effects arc got in original and unusual ways.
When all this is heartily said, there arc some
other things which a view of the work m
the mass make evident. The facility of the
author leads often to an extension of her
theme beyond its lyrical limits; and the
effect is rhetorical rather than poetical. Fine
as so much of the work in the volume is, it
is well within the mark to say that one-lialf
of it would have been much stronger than
the whole. On the other hand, it is not easy
to suggest with reference to any one poem or
to the whole book what should have been
omitted. It is even probable that the
thinning-out of the theme is part and parcel
of the make-up of the singer; and, after, all,
if Marie Pitt seems to fail in this respect
she fails in the very good company, not only
of Wordsworth and Shelley, but of Swin-
burne and most of the, most distinguished'
modern writers. The same apology may be
offered for a more notable defect in the
whole work—the tendency to make very good
verse on very slender provocation.
Yet when all deductions are made this is a
hook for Which Australia should be thank-
ful. The author’s outlook is always noble ;
her hand is always sure; and what-she sees
is seen honestly aud sweetly. There are no
tricks in the book, and there are many very
real graces. If her passion does not leap to
white hot flame it glows sincerely; if she
does not open the gates into new places she
sees many unnoticed things by the old way.
The book is full of memorable lines. Take
a few almost at random
A bittern booms across the eaverned dusk.
Where the lean pack-train threads the flinty roads.
In Banshee winds down sunset gullies sobbing.
(>’«• tlie blown bright edge of the star-strewn plain.
The pang that chokes the muttered word, the tear
too salt to weep.
The little season of a mother’s keeping.
With the first grey hair i’ the head o’ the year.
In "The Promised Land” the author sets to
marching music most that she feels and
dreams about Australia. It is a worthy
contribution to our already large literature
of national aspiration and the longest poem
in the hook; but I like her better in other
moods
Oil, sadly play the pipes of Death;
Oh, sadly play through falling tears 1
There is a shadow on the . years—
Elizabeth! Elizabeth.
And love shall be fairy gold
For a little heaping,
Till night, and the hands fold
For the long sleeping.
Haply shall there remain
Of all we cherished,
That which we wrought with pain
Lest our souls perished.
When the cross dips westward,
And owls fly nestward,
And the world is throbbing with magpie songs,
Comes a horseman riding
With a loose rein riding,
Comes riding over? the Dandenongs.
And this of the peace of the world:—
Ami they who spake her name of old
Come with proud pomp of heraldry,
The standard of the cloth of gold,
The Lion and the Fleur de Lis....
And, wrapt in his one garment’s fold,
Poor Christ, who died upon a tree.
Yea, through the throng, like shadows fleet,
I see them pass with burning eyes;
The jesters jostle in the street;
Wax fools in their own folly wise?
With her, green Earth were good and sweet;
In bondage still my Lady lies.
Here is a striking sonnet: —
Rail not at Mammon, helots of to-day,
Nor curse Bellona. goddess of the sword,
Nor Tyranny of Toil, meet overlord:
This is your covenant —-“You must obey!”
Under its ban your helot-mothers lay!
Your sires, slave-born to slave-born mothers, poured
The glutton’s wine, or cringed for bed and board:
Why murmur then? And whence your blank dismay?
Not with red rite of sword on Strife’s wan hill,
’Mid clash of arms and pomp of war’s estate,
Was Freedom slain, and her strong sons laid low,
But in some wild, red dawning long ago,
When Man, the savage, took his savage mate,
And beat, and bent and broke her to his will.
To attempt to speak of Marie E. .1. Pitt’s
relative place among Australian poets by
the measure of this achievement would be
waste of words. The future will justly decide
these things; and the book shows that this
graceful and forceful singer has a place in
that future.

Old Magic
John Masefield published Ms “Sailor’s Gar-
land” in 1906, so it will seem a little late
in the day to draw attention now to this
compilation. Moreover, the fact that two
fresh editions have been issued since then
dismisses any plea that the book has been
overlooked, or lost in the mass of later John
Masefield productions. But the poems them-
selves are nearly all so old that this was
surely a classic long before ever it first
appeared. I am wondering how many un-
printed editions it has gone through—mem-
orised, vocal editions passed' from mouth to
bearded, singing mouth, and so carried from
. ship to tall ship. My late-seeming notes are
excused on this very ground: thpy are made
about songs as new now as at any time:
fur they are concerned chiefly with ancient
anonymous ballads and chanties. Of writ-
, ten poems about the sea I will only say
here that the more modern • are infinitely
better than the elder, for the former have
fallen in with the mood of true sea-songs
and have caught much of their magic.
Indeed, magic is the correct term. What
else hut magic could make mere printed
words a stinging spray wind-flung on the
cheek? Originating from the rhymes of
some bold spirit probably, present at, the
event celebrated, each ballad has been altered
find adapted by a multitude of men in a
multitude of places. Each is the product
of many minds, many tongues, many voices.
Or, perhaps, of one universal mind, tongue,
voice—that of Poseidon himself. But it is
the- chanties and the shorter songs and
choruses that charm me most. These more
than any other compositions in our language
are the product of no one identity but of
the elements. The chanties are specifically
songs sung .by men at work. Sailors work-
ing together at some task requiring unison
and harmonic effort have composed rhyth-
mic, melodious timekeepers, and have found
a song to be “ten men on the rope.” Little
importance need be attached to the meaning
of any chant so long as it serves to hang
a tune to
Louis was the King of France afore the Revolution,
Away, haul away, boys, haul away O ;
But Louis got, liis head cut off, which spoiled his
constitution,
Away , haul away, boys, haul away 0.
And yet there is more than meaning in such
words; there is ancestry and there is age.
There is, in short, a very old magic. The
same lines and variations of the same have
been sung by generations of toiling sailors:
they are lost in time. Nor are such lines
mere curios to which antiquity has added
fin extrinsic interest, The emotional effect
of antiquity is intrinsic in the words them-
selves and in the ancestry of the-phraseology;
so that all seas, all sailors and all ships
are conjured up, making the ears hear and
the heart feel more than the brain under-
stands 1 .
This is no mere' fancy. A similar claim
may justly be made for folk-song of every
description, and, in fact, for all words into
which are poured the hopes of many people,
the labor of their hands, the needs of their
lives, the, sweat of their bodies. Words are sym-
bols, and symbols of other words; each has
many more meanings than the common dic-
tionary paraphrase. Meaning is reflected
from suggestion, and suggestion glitters from
meaning almost infinitely. Indeed, in uttering
any word-symbol, we are, as it were, sub-
consciously aware of all uses to which our
symbol has been put by all who have ever
spoken it. Scientists and philosophers
explain such things as “association.” I find
something deeper, however, which I prefer
to call magic. It is the tradition of words.
Language'' is qn inexhaustible memory, for
the mind, remembering and selecting from
ail shades of meaning known to it, preserves
the suggestions and associations of bygone
centuries; nor is the-ancestry of any word
ever lost. To a large extent it is the genius
for selecting and rejecting from such material
that creates great poetry; for in this manner
the frailest of emotions have been inspired
by the imagination with concrete, life, and
have danced like tangible fairies in a vivid
moonlight.
But now I find that I have overstated my
case in insisting that sea-songs, collected
and printed, retain ail the magic of strain-
ing sheets and spread sails. Songs are in-
separably united with their music,, and the
music, alas! is silent between two covers
of a book. That the perpetual memory may
be invoked it is necessary that these songs
be sung by male voices. I know that of
this collection only those songs, which I
have so heard give me deep emotional plea-
sure. But I nray that I may yet hear the
others. Albeit it was sung by amateur
sailors and aboard a pleasure craft, I shall
remember forever how the sea flowed into
me when first I heard the obscene words
and magnificent tune of “The Maid of Am-
sterdam.” One stanza is quotable—but you
must hear it sung:—
I placed my hand upon her knee,
Now mark well what I say.
I placed my hand upon her knee;
She said: “Young man, you’re rather free.”
And I’ll go no more a-ro-oaming
With you, Fair Maid.
A-roaming, a-roaming,
Since roaming’s been my ru-in,
I’ll go no more a-ro-oaming
With you, Fair Maid.

Post-mortems on Anatole France
Not very much interested. I turned the
pages of Monde Medical, a highly technical
journal, as of course it should be. There
was some illness with the entente cordiale
name of Parkinsonnisme. There was an
article on how to administer cod-liver oil
indirectly—and indeed the direct - method
has often failed. One came on cancer.
Adenoids/ The brain —what is this?
When death had closed the eyes of the master,
Anatole France, those eyes that had so greatly loved
to seek out the beauty scattered through the w0r1d....
It went on to say that after his death the
brain had been removed and examined: —•
It was the most magnificent brain conceivable, as
regards the amplitude, number and delicacy of its
convolutions. In fact the brain of Anatole France
corresponded to his genius, which it also explained.
It was fairly astonishing to find in a medical
journal such impassioned words about a
writer. It amounted to this, that long before
his death Anatole France was, in the eyes of
the public, no mere writer, but a fixed star.
He lived almost long enough to read his own
obituaries —all but the mere mention of his
death. Without fail, then, whatever was
written after his death would only repeat
the many discreet panegyrics written during
his life. . . '■ ,
The chief medium for fixing him, the final
hypo bath, so to speak, had been the “Propos
d’Anatole France,” written a few years be-
fore his death by Paul Gsell. that clever
Boswell who had presented. Rodin to the
world half a dozen years earlier. In his r6le

DAVID JONES’
hr Service-SYDNEY.
of an interested dullard, Gsell draws out the
master, not forgetting to surround his “cher
motive” with the graceful setting of his
elaborate Parisian home, which is styled “the
cottage of the sage.” Those who did not
call the sage “cher motive” might add a
touch of archness by addressing him as “Mon-
sieur Bergeret” or “Monsieur Coignard,”
those figures whose privilege it had been to
utter the cream of their creator’s philosophy.
The charming picture suggested above all a
life that Sylvestre Bonnard might have en-
joyed. Now “Sylvestre Bonnard,” for all
its mellow charm, was one of Anatole
France’s earlier books. That is, Bonnard
w r as a figure of the nineteenth century, a
Renan, for instance.
There were those critics of the present
century and of its post-war period to whom
the idyllic figure of Anatole France with his
rare cameos and his sardonic aloofness from
life was a mockery and an offence. Among
those some spoke out. The Dada-ists, whose
movement had died out, made a gesture of
corporate life on the day after Anatole
France’s death, and published a pamphlet
called “A Corpse,” in which, one after an-
other, they attacked his memory:—
Without God, without touching love, without in-
supportable despair, without magnificent anger, with-
out definite defeats, without complete victories.
Seeming to find any stick good enough for
beating the object of their common anger,
they accused him of cowardice, compromise,
traditionalism, patriotism, realism, of
betraying the French Revolution (as in “The
Gods Are Athirst”). They sneered at his
faint socialism and howled down liis “meagre
philosophy.” Not that the Dada-ists with
their consistent motto, “Dodo crache tout,” and
to be taken as representing French opinion!
Forgetting them, though, if we can, we come
on two recently published biographies of
Anatole France, and here again we find an
absence of the “ cher motive” attitude, It is
disconcerting, as if some people had been
hoarding a fearful secret, to reveal it after
the great man’s death.
What, then, are these revelations? The
first book is “Anatole France en Pantoufies,”
by J.-J. Bronsson, who acted as secretary
during the preparation of the “Vie de Jeanne
d’Arc.” That was the keystone book for
Anatole France, and tjhe dry, disillusioned tone
of it seems to have \ communicated itself to
the secretary-turned-biographer. So to M.
Bronsson all Anatole France’s tact becomes
hypocrisy, and his moodiness or variation in
tone is explained in the same rule-of-thumb
way. Bronsson cannot accept it as natural
that the author of “La Vie en Fleur,” with
its selected, idyllic passages from a remem-
bered childhood, should one day have looked
his secretary in .the face and said feverishly,
“They call me happy, but I have never in
my life been happy.” Bronsson takes this
apparent contradiction as literal and real.
This is to imagine that a man can never be
“en pantoufies”; as if whatever one admitted
were to be, as the policemen say, “taken
down against us.” . Here you had an exqui-
sitely finished book like “La Vie en Fleur”
expressing some facet of life. Reacting, then,
one day from such a surrender to naive joy,
its writer will mutter, “I have always been
the unhappiest of men!” That statement
as it stands, without literary perspective, is
a mere noise, and cannot cancel a work of
art. So it goes all through. M- Bronsson
records certain moody utterances inconsis-
tent with the higher moments of the sage.
The second biographer, M. Le Goff, is more
literal still. He gives an account of political
conversations which he takes in deadly earn-
est, deciding that Anatole France is insin-
cere, because some of his utterances cancel
out. Anatole France, as everyone knows,
was a radical, a radical-socialist, or what-
ever hyphenated name would be used for
someone who was perfectly “Left” in poli-
tics. M. Le Goff makes a pained revelation
that Anatole France was sceptical of all
parties; ergo, he was a hypocrite. Further,
in the matter of “patriotism,” M. Le Goff
once said to Anatole France something depre-
catory of his war-time articles, “Sur la Voie
Glorieuse.” Innocently confiding, the master
said to his biographer: “Yes, I’ve spoken like
my concierge. It was shameful, but neces-
sary.” Of this whimsical admission M. Le
Goff makes solemn use.
All these revelations and attacks arise, of
course, from Anatole France’s length of life,
which allowed the Grand Old Man legend to
arise and made him into a popular figure
with those who never read his books. Any-
one who sees a popular fallacy in the course
of growth enjoys pricking the bubble. But
is this bubble seriously pricked? We are
shown what we knew, that Anatole France
was not more than human. We are told
that his scepticism was a meagre philosophy,
leaving the sceptic still hungering; but that,
again, was in all his books, here between
the lines, there writ large. Sceptical of all
parties, yet loyal always to the one; scepti-
cal of all final interpretations of the cosmos,
yet enamored of reason and order; sceptical
of humanity’s culture (as in “Penguin
Island”), yet impassioned for all the lovely
forms that human hands have made. Such
was Anatole France, and no “revelations”
can destroy him.

The Highway of Bohemia
The historic associations of the Strand and
Fleet-street may be ruled out of the motives
that prompted the erection of Australia House
on its present site. Nevertheless, the reflec-
tive Australian standing on the steps of the
building may be pardoned for some lapse into
sentiment when he recalls that along this
street all the great ones have passed in pro-
cession as long as the centuries of English
history; in imagination he may hear the
“crab-shell” coaches filled with gaily-clad
ladies rumble over the rude pavement and
pass the streams of water that, to allow of
its making, had been diverted from their
course. He will reflect, too. that within call
is that nerve centre of Empire, the journal-
istic Mecca of Fleet-street. A short walk
wall bring him to the Temple, next to which
once stood Alsatia, the far-away and dis-
reputable progenitor of Bohemia. There
secure from all process of law, save the writ
of the Lord Chief Justice and the Lords of
the Privy Council, dwelt all the rascaldom
of the times, thieves, coiners, homicides,
foreign desperadoes ready for any sinister
deed. Alsatia was swept away, and up to
the end of the eighteenth century the Strand
became a smugly respectable quarter whose
buildings w r ere principally residential. The
nineteenth century changed all that, and into
it Fleet-street, and such side avenues as
Wellington and Catherine streets, poured all
the busy life of the newspaper offices, the
publishing houses and their offspring. Night
was turned into day, cookshops and public
houses filled up at midnight as in the
staid city they filled at noon or thereabout.
This region was one of the quaintest, most
eccentric and certainly most interesting in
London. The present generation can hardly
visualise what it was in the mid-Victorian
age and later days of the old Queen’s reign.
To-day, substituting hotels for residences, it
has reverted almost to the dull respectability
of its eighteenth-century period.
Harry Furniss, one of the last of the
caricaturists of the past century, a few
months before his recent death, wrote
and illustrated a volume entitled Some
Victorian Men (John Lane), in which
he recalls personal impressions and recol-
lections of outstanding figures in his day—
great politicians, orators, ecclesiastics, actors
and so on of the Victorian era. One of the
most attractive chapters in a book filled with
interesting eauserie on men and matters is
devoted to this old Bohemian centre: —
The present generation, acquainted with London only
as it is to-day, can hardly conceive what an eccentric-
looking thoroughfare the Strand presented when it
was frequented by the last generation, with its old-
fashioned theatre-frontages, its gaudy hanging-adver-
tisements, its newsvendors’ shops ; with its anything
but attractive yet conspicuous eating-houses, its news-
paper offices, “wines from the wood” stores, pickle
purveyors and temporary freak-shop attractions. As
higgledy-piggledy a place as one could find any-
where, and yet with a certain distinction of its own.
For, after all, it was the historical Strand.
Literary men and journalists were not in
those days, as a rule, members of clubs.
They foregathered sometimes at well-known
night haunts, but met more frequently at
favored public-houses, and lounged at the
bar or gathered round the small side-tables.
“When I came to London in the early seven-
ties,” he remarks, “our greatest actors and
writers were to be found at the bars. It was
in such places that editors bought novels,
actors were engaged and dramatists were
seen handing over newly-written acts be-
tween drinks. Mr. Failure found there con-
solation, and Mr. Success congratulation.
They both meant the same thing—drink.”
Furniss recalls a well-krown figure in the
literary Bohemia of liis day who was then a
writer of stories for the popular papers:
the kind of story which furnishes delight to
circles in high-life below stairs —the Duke
runs away with the pretty housemaid or the
Duchess elopes with the butler, that figure
of romance, the chauffeur, not having then
arrived. This Bohemian —for a thorough
Bohemian he was —“knowing nothing of the
Society about which he wrote so fully, had
the power of making himself (and sometimes
fresh acquaintances) believe that the fiction
of his books was a mere retailing of his real
life.” Fortified from time to time with re-
freshers of brandy and soda, or sometimes
“hot with a little sugar,” he would tickle
the ears of his circle with _ the most
astounding adventures in high life. There
are scores upon scores of Australian readers
who to-day read eagerly the novels that flow
from the pen of this once Bohemian, pro-
duced with the mechanical precision and the
rapid sequence of a string of sausages—and
they swear by him. Furniss describes their
meeting:—
Thirty or forty years elapsed, and I was intro-
duced to an author. A tall, military, voluble gentle-
man, who was producing book after book, and taking
the publishing world by storm with novels printed in
a cheap form that sold “like hot cakes”—in point of
fact, he was known as the best seller of our day. He
was very popular with everyone. A prosperous
country gentleman, of liberal and generous habits.
This was Charles Garvice, beloved of the shopgirl
and clerk readers both here and in America. He sent
me one of his books, and as I read it I believed
that I had read something of the kind before in
books published during my youth. After a
time I ventured to tell him so. “Right you are,
my boy, you have hit it. I reeled those stories off
one after the other. I was imbued with them. T
lived in them, old chap, and delighted in the work.
I could live by them and that was all. I went
over to America a few years ago, and found
they had extracted my stories from the old
papers in whch they originally appeared, and
were selling in thousands. I returned to Eng-
land and bought up the paper, which carried
copyrights from the start, and by this means I got
all my old stories in hand again. I re-write them
in parts and re-issue them,' and, what is more, sell
them as quickly as my publishers can produce them!”
That was how the amiable, clever Garvice made his
fortune. There never was a more popular writer.
I saw no trace of his early eccentricity. He looked
what he was, a country gentleman, and one who was
universally respected.
For those who lived their prime in Vic-
torian days this book, enriched with numerous
caricatures from the author’s pencil, will
furnish a feast in their leisure hours. And
many a Digger will find in it touches that
will awaken recollections not so old but
quite as alluring.

Art and the Bookmaker
Why do men bet on horses?
The cynic, of course, says that it is in
the hope of getting something for nothing.
This is the truth. But it is not the whole
truth. There is, for instance, the herd com-
plex—what your neighbors think of you.
The mob bets, and you must bet, too, though
it may not matter tuppence whether you win
or lose, or whether the horse you back is
just a fantastic name to you. Then there
is the thrill of sheer gambling. You shut
your eyes and stab at a list of names with
a pin. and bet on the name you strike. Money
enters the business, but only as a means to
an end, a necessary but subordinate factor
in the production of a thrill. Finally, there
is the mass of race-followers who do follow
races. They display an amazing amount of
intelligence and persistence in the matter.
They keep themselves absolutely up to date.
They argue logically and exhaustively over
results, and from them draw* quite sane con-
clusions.
But these not only bet on their fancies;
they actually pay out good money for the
nurnose of watching the race being'rnn. This
is the mysterious part. If they simply betted,
if they simply risked their money as specu-
lators in the hope of big returns if they
never troubled to see the race, if the horse
was to them a name and nothing more, it
would be quite understandable. A business
proposition pure and simple, albeit not as
conservative or justifiable as other financial
investments. But it isn’t. These race-
followers are really and honestly interested
in their horses. They like to look at them,
to note their condition, to be close to them,
though they may be city-dwellers and en-
tirely ignorant of the country.
The explanation that seems to account for
it is simply that in these race-followers there
are buried artists. The ordinary man’s life
does not permit his love of beauty and fine-
ness to appear. It is snowed under by the
blatancy of his daily round, and the multi-
tude of small, unlovely worries that beset
him. To show a desire for beautiful things,
to give way emotion for so immaterial a
thing as poetry, is inevitably connected with
long hair, lax morals and large neckties.
Since the ordinary man’s pet aversion is to
be laughed at, lie firmly suppresses these un-
manly sentiments. But the stifled poet with-
in him cries out at the beauty of sheer
animal perfection, at the sheen of healthy
skin, at the smooth elasticity of fine muscle,
at the noble qualities of endurance and game-
ness, that centre in the racehorse. And so—
he puts his fiver on his fancy!
PHILIP BENN.
Criticism and the Feminine
Alice Jackson is dogmatic in her insist-
ence on sexual psychological equality (R.P.
16/4/’25). In fact, she seems to suggest
that, apart from artificial dissimilarities im-
posed by external environment, differences
are insignificant. Which is absurd. The
differences between egotistical paternal pride
and the altruistic maternal instinct, the dis-
parity in sexual energy (involving itself con-
siderable emotional and intellectual inequali-
ties) and the greater gregariousness of
women ensure psychological dissimilarities
of a fundamental kind, the ignoring of which
would be dangerous for both men and women.
Because in considering the constitution of
the popular novel I had reason to emphasise
certain feminine deficiencies, Alice Jackson
declares that I am suffering from a “superi-
ority complex.” It is a pity to introduce
the futile personal note into questions of
this kind, but I can assure the lady that
I do not believe man is superior to woman.
The differences one perceives are everywhere
rather of degree than of kind ; and, moreover,
a superiority in one sphere usually involves
an inferiority elsewhere. Thus woman’s
superiorities are mostly in the realm of feel-
ing, and this involves deficiencies in the in-
tellectual sphere. I do not, as Alice Jack-
son declares, “dismiss psycho-analysis with
a contemptuous gesture” simply because 1
used the term “psycho-analysis craze.”
Psycho-analysis is a craze to-day because
its importance is vastly exaggerated; but
seen in due proportion it is a pleasant and
profitable study. There is no one theory
of life so universally true that it remains
beneficial when arbitrarily applied. Life,
like a beautiful, elusive butterfly, has ever
evaded our nets. Which, in the final issue,
is one reason why we continue to live.
T. JASPER.
A Satchel of Books
A Brief History of Civilisation, by J. S. Hoyland,
M.A. (Oxford Press). H. G. Wells attempted the
feat in 608 pages. Hoyland’s measures 282 pages of
half the size and is designed to fit into the satchels
of the pupils of the secondary schools. Whether, in
this tabloid form, it will get into their heads and
having got there provide them with any nourish-
rrunt, is doubtful.
By Order of the Five, by Herbert Adams
(Methuen). The South Pacific is still to the English
reader very remote and a safe place for the novelist
to build his kingdoms. Air. Adams has named the
island of his dreams Turnera and given it a Spanish
colony apparently self-misgoverned. His hero lands
there to grow coffee, becomes concerned in its
polities, is offered the crown, but hesitates to
accept. Olive-tinted Murietta settles the business,
and they live happy ever after.
Utter Happiness, by Frank Savile (Edward
Arnold). The author of “The High Grass Trail’’ and
other novels returns to Africa for his plot. The
hero is the English Governor of a district of which
Hadj Halil is the native Kaid, and the central
interest turns on the engineering of the latter to
bring about a marriage between the Governor and
a titled visiting English lady. The book shows a
first-hand knowledge of official life, and is interest-
ing for the sidelights it throws upon latter-day
English administration abroad. As a piece of Action
it is in a lower class.
Europe Overseas, by J. A. Williamson (Oxford
Press). One of the “World Manuals.” In tabloid
form, but lucidly told, the history of how Europe
commandeered the globe. The process began when
Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape in 1488. About
1890 the buccaneering nations squabbled over the
subdivision of China, then ripe for cutting up in
the manner of India. Their hesitation gave Japan a
breathing space and she built herself an army and
navy, altering the whole problems. This generation
has probably seen the European tide reach high-
water mark, and may even be fated to see its ebb.
And Obey, by L. C. Dunsterville (Arnold). The
writer is a Major-General, reputed to be the original
of Kipling’s “Stalky.” This is not his first appearance
in literature, but hitherto he has not attempted
fiction. He uses his military experiences as a
background. The heroine, whilst admitting love for
the man who has offered her marriage, has views
about the Anglican service. “I think it is awful,”
she declares. “I have to say ‘obey’ and that I will
never do.” The lover is inclined to treat the matter
lightly; the lady regards it quite seriously. But
in the end Beatrice, “as though in a trance,”
walked up to her soldier-lover and said “and obey.”
It is too much to hope that feminists will be satisfied
with this solution.
The Christian Outlook, by Sir William J. Ashley
(Longmans). The author in these “sermons of an
economist” endeavors to put what he regards as
the Christian attitude towards life, having special
regard to its bearing upon modern economic and
social questions. In doing this he gives a broad
definition of what he understands the word “Chris-
tianity” to convey. “Christianity,” he says, “is
essentially an attitude and a temper; an attitude of
confidence that somehow the universe has a good
meaning, a temper of determination to help our
fellow-men. Such an attitude is not inconsistent
with the large lessons of human evolution as taught
us by modern science; and it is conducive to pro-
gress as our reason conceives it.” He contrasts
the modern attitude towards religion with that of
past centuries: “We are living in the midst of a
reaction against all outward expressions of religion
that are sharply dogmatic in creed or harshly restric-
tive of conduct. Young men and women —-especially
of the student class —will accept no belief on autho-
rity ; they will refrain from no behavior which
seems to them pleasurable and innocent. It is free-
dom they desire: freedom to use the faculties of mind
and body with which they feel themselves endowed.”
The author regards this reaction as in itself a whole-
some one, and a necessary stage in the spiritual
development of the race. The reader on his nart
may ponder whether the ancient bottle of orthodoxy
will be able to contain this new wine without disas-
trous consequences to it.

Droop with the dreams of a dead romance;
Dreams of the bush, of the fresh, free air:
Dreams of the rocks on a mountain’s face;
Swishing of rains in the branches there;
Trickles that ripple and rise and race;
Giant trunks that are gleaming white
Down on the flats where the curlews cry;
Shimmering skies that the friendly night
Dots with the stars that are soft and shy;
Glittering dew: and the gentle winds
Murmuring hymns for the dawn and dusk ;
Tresses of gold that the wattle binds ;
Scents that are softer than myrrh or

Songs of the birds... .but your slender bow
Halts for the praise of the hand-clapping

They come by the east from the dawn-lands
fair,
The Sun and the Wind and the Sea.
Cold cities wake in the morning air,
Chained vessels stir at the quay;
For wondrous subtle and kind and rare
Is the touch of the Magic Three.
The skirts of the wind are fairy light
On the breast of the waters blue;
The sun is warm in the morning bright
As the kiss of a love come true.
Oh! wiud and waters and sunbeams white,
There is nothing as free as you !
For the wind roves wild through a world
enslaved —
Oh, the thrash and stamp of the gales
O’er the level tracks by their white wrath
paved
To the quiver of drumming sails!
Oh. the roaring song of the steel that braved
The terror that lipped the rails!
The sunshine glows through a million miles
To the humblest vale or sod;
On cot and kingdom and waste it smiles
Where the slaves of a world have trod ;
Its red gold gleams on the blessed-isles
As free as the gifts of God.
The sea curves over the ends of earth ;
And hard though the steamers strive
To measure their wakes on the oceans’ girth
For many a long week’s drive,
Yet out of the waves new lands have birth
On the coast of the oceans five.
They go by the west to the night realms
rare.
The wind and the sun and the sea.
The cities drowse in the evening air
And the liners dream by the quay:
For wondrous quiet and sweet and fair
Are Desk and the Magic Three.

/ A Beverage
with a
Double Purpose.
WOLFE’S SCHNAPPS differs from all
other stimulants in that it is something
more than a “drink.” It is, above all,
a beverage with a medicinal purpose. Its
diuretic effect—its corrective action on the
kidneys, assisting them to function properly
and filter from the system the impurities they
collect—is its most valuable feature.
That is why the greatest good accrues from
the moderate use of Wolfe’s. “One Wolfe’s
a Day for Your Health’s Sake” is the course
prescribed by experience and wisdom. Make
it your Golden Rule and you will become just
one more in the multitude who, through three
generations, have found Wolfe’s Schnapps a
wonderfully beneficial stimulant.
Wolfe’s Schnapps is obtain-
able in three sizes—Quarter
Bottles, Half Bottles and
Large Bottles.

IN THE MULTITUDE OF PARTIES...
Bruxner, leader of the N. S. Wales Progres-
sives, returned to Sydney last week with
the report that his party was travelling so
well in Murray, Goulburn, Cootamundra
and Wammerawa that it had “more than
good prospects” of winning seven seats in
those electorates, instead of four. As re-
gards the general outlook, he was a “very
confident” Mick Bruxneii, he said. Another
and more widely held impression is that the
Progressives will be luckv if they retain the
10 seats they owned in' the last Assembly
when Nesbitt, who was elected as a Nation-
alist, and avlio is not standing again, joined
them. Public opinion is not so indulgent
to the Cocky groups as it was a few years
ago. It has been repelled by their faction-
fights, by their selfishness in demanding High
Protection for the products in which they
are specially interested and Freetrade in
nearly everything else, and by their disposi-
tion to make settled government impossible,
except at the price of excessive representa-
tion in the Ministry or special legislation
in the interest of their particular section, or
both, where they chanced to hold the balance
of power. Admittedly Bruxner has so far
resisted the temptation to which Earle
Page and the Victorian Allan surrendered,
the former when he successfully demanded
half the portfolios in the Commonwealth
Cabinet for a party with 15 members in a
Parliament of 111, and the latter, when, at the
fifth change of Ministry in about 18 months
(all due, in a measure, to the manoeuvres of
his party of 18 or 14), he repeated Page's exac-
tion and grabbed the Premiership himself. But
the crack of the third party’s whip was heard
too often in the late N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment, notwithstanding its leader's claim that
“more bills were placed before the House as
non-party measures than ever before.” And the
public has really no guarantee that Bruxner
won’t deal with Fuller (or it may be Ley)
as Page dealt with Bruce, or that he won’t
make government as difficult in N. S. Wales
during the next three years as Allan has
made it in Victoria during the last five.
* * * *
Nor do the electors share the Progressive
chief’s enthusiasm for proportional repre-
sentation. He seems to have a notion that
without “this perfect system,” as he calls
it, his party would be crushed between Labor
and Nationalism, although if it can poll as
well as it did in 1022 or 1920 it has nothing
to fear from single electorates with prefer-
ential voting. It was under these conditions
that the Westralian Cockies became the
strongest of all the Country parties, and
much more numerous than the State Nation-
alists, until they split on some trumpery
cockychaff issue unintelligible to people in
general. The system pronounced “perfect”
by Mr. Bruxner does away with the salutary
check of by-elections and admits of elected
persons changing their parties, presenting
their seats to rejected candidates and
appointing as a successor to a deceased mem-
ber a stranger to Parliamentary elections,
all without reference to the constituencies.
In theory it enables the majority to govern
and minorities to be heard; in practice, as
has been shown in N. S. Wales and Tas-
mania, it confers such extraordinary powers
on minority representatives that Govern-
ments dance to their tune. For all practical
purposes the legislation passed in the N. S.
Wales Parliament during the last three years
has been determined by Bruxner and his
group of nine or ten members in a House of
90. During the next three years, if Labor
gains a few seats without getting a majority
; —and even a majority of votes may not give
it a majority of seats under the “perfect”
system—the legislative dictatorship may be
transferred to “Motherhood” McGirr, or
Fallon of the Catholic Federation, or
Skelton, the Protestant Labor champion, or
Garden, the Communist, who has made the
pilgrimage to Moscow. For the “perfect”
system, by rendering it exceedingly difficult
for any one party to get a majority of seats,
and by giving representation to any minority
that can dig up one-sixth of the vote plus
one in a five-member constituency (less if
none of the candidates left in the last count
can get the quota) has excited the hopes of
political filibusters and organisations of
cranks, sectaries and destructionists who
would have no chance in single electorates.
So we find 19 Protestant Labor candidates,
six Communists, three “Majority Laborites,”
five “Yaps” (McGirr’s “Young Australia
party”), Prohibitionists, Catholic Federa-
tionists and about 30 “Independents” stand-
ing for election at the end of the month,
as well as 91 Laborites, 88 Nationalists and
35 Progressives. And it is not at all unlikely
that one Yap, one Protestant Laborite, one
Catholic Federationist and one Independent
will be elected.
* * # »
If a Labor Government emerges from the
chaos of candidates, better one with its
own majority than one subservient to
McGirr, Fallon, Skelton, Garden or
Gardiner. If a Nationalist Government
survives, better one with a Nationalist majo-
rity than one dependent on Bruxner and his
friends, unless the latter accept their share
of responsibility without extorting more than
their share of the spoils. Still, no Govern-
ment formed from any one party could be
as satisfactory as an elective Ministry re-
presentative of all. An elective Ministry
could afford to laugh at the manoeuvres of
such as Skelton, Fallon, McGirr and
Garden, who would be powerless to harm
it. Its effect would be such that measures
would be debated in a more reasonable spirit
and decided according to the real opinions
of a majority of members, instead of reflect-
ing the view's of a clique in a caucus, as
happens so often now. And by exhibiting
the spectacle of politicians, once divided by
bitter animosities, co-operating in the same
Government for the common good, it would
tend to improve the relations between em-
ployer and employed, and to make it in-
creasingly difficult to stir up hateful strife
between class and class, and between sect
and sect. According to Bruxner, elective
Ministries are “the ultimate objective” of his
party. If it were the straightout policy in-
stead of the “ultimate objective,” the Pro-
gressives would get a great deal more sup-
port at the polls than now seems probable.
Australia is rather tired of hearing about
“objectives.”
THE BORROWINGS THAT DESTROY.
When the old Hebrew prophets raised their
voices against the imported gods of foreign
nations their plea was as much national as
religious. They saw with clearness of vision
the impossibility of maintaining the things
that had given stamina and force during their
early invasion of Palestine if the customs
and habits of larger peoples became estab-
fished in the land. In their propaganda of
nationalism they voiced not only the special
need of the Israelitish State but a principle
that is of world-wide application. Every
nation grows up on individual fines; and
once these are perverted, though there may
remain a semblance of nationality, the force
that gave it cohesion is gone. Greece was
warped by contact with the nearer countries
of Asia. The pull of the mighty empires
was too strong for the rather narrow Hellenic
patriotism. Pausanias, the Spartan who
commanded at Plataea and won perhaps the
most important battle in European history,
was within the year traitorously intriguing
with Xerxes. The later Greek grew more
and more Asiatic in habit, while keeping up
an immense reverence for his own past; and
finally under the banner of a new Asiatic
religion lie exerted greater actual power than
in his days of highest culture. Yet the
Christian Greek of the time of Constan-
tine had hardly a trace of resemblance to
the Spartan of the Persian War or the
Athenian of the time of Pericles, much
less to the Greek of the ages of Sappho and
of llomer. The Greek never became Asiatic,
hut there was enough infusion of Asiatic
spirit to destroy the wonderful Hellenism
that did so much for the world. Still more
clearly can the decay of Rome be traced to
the influence of Greece—an influence which
some of the best Romans deplored yet were
unable to stop. The Greek things which
the Romans borrowed were in a sense finer
than any Rome itself possessed; but
they were foreign, alien to the spirit of the
nation. And the worst corruption was closely
linked with the introduction of much that
was best when judged by other standards.
The intense faith in Roman institutions, the
stern willingness to endure discipline and
the zeal to set the ideal of the State far
above any personal gain became impossible
when Greek refinements were more regarded
than the severe Roman home. The Roman
conquests, too, give point to the theory that
no nation can survive on its borrowings.
Of all the nations brought under the Empire,
ruled by Roman law and schooled in Roman
ways, not one succeeded in maintaining a
separate life as a sovereign State after the
fall of the Empire itself; yet nations just
beyond the imperial boundaries, which were
far less advanced and far less instructed,
did maintain an independence for long years
after the ruin and chaos of the Gothic de-
scent on the capital. In at least one instance
that independence remains to the present
hour.
* * * #
The borrowings of civilisation are neces-
sarily large and numerous; and these bor-
rowings are not likely to prove ruinous
unless they are of a nature which is directly
opposed to some tradition on which an ele-
ment of national virtue is based or are made
on an extravagant scale. England gained
a great deal through being for ages.an asylum
for the oppressed of Europe. Skilled trades
were brought by foreigners who settled down
and became English; but such introductions
did not for a moment disturb the settled life
of the towns and villages or upset the tradi-
tions of the people. Tens of thousands of
English families are of Huguenot descent,
yet they hold nothing of French tradition.
The influence of France on England and of
England on France has always been of a
kind which failed to touch fundamentals
and left the nations as distinctive as before.
On the other hand smaller States of Europe
have lost much of their individuality through
their association with larger nations. It
is easy in such cases to mistake losses for
gains, and to regard as trivial the little
things that in their total sum amount to so
much. Most countries, for instance, have
borrowed British Parliamentary institutions
in some modified form• but in the modifica-
tion the national spirit has so manifested
itself that the hand of Britain is not seen
in any act of the foreign Parliament. The
borrowing of French literature by countries
that have little literature of their own has
been an entirely different matter. There the
higher grades of society have through that
borrowing taken on something of a French
tone which badly fits their different racial
make-up. A good deal of the so-called inter-
nationalism which has worked to such disas-
trous results in the political movements of
Europe has been due in the first place to
literary borrowings by people who read false
meaning into work in alien languages—lan-
guages which were easily acquired but never
understood. A Bulgarian or an Armenian
may easily acquire the English speech, but
only those of British descent can understand
the peculiar forms of British political criti-
cism, its notes of exaggeration and its sug-
gestions of infamy which no one is expected
to interpret literally. The English habit,
on the other hand, of reading the work of
all foreigners with a shade of contempt may
be a shameful exhibition of insular prejudice,
but it has not been without its national uses.
Borrowings in the realm of invention and
pure science can work no injury; it is the
borrowings that touch the fundamentals of
national thought and feeling that pervert
the nation—and that without reference to
the question whether the things borrowed
are in themselves good or bad.
* * * *
Australia started with a stock of British
traditions and feelings and undertook the
task of translating them into terms of wider
spaces and a sunnier climate. In the course
of a century or so Australians achieved
nationality—not a very distinct nationality
in that the British note continued to pre-
dominate, but a nationality built on realities
and fostered by great dreams of the future.
Though the country did not pass through an
actual backwoods period, like that of the
early American settlers, in which it was
necessary to tear from the land itself every
means of life, the people were forced to dis-
cover new ways of doing things; and so
they acquired a new outlook and new ideals.
The little flock of sheep placed in a fold for
the night gave place to the big mob driven a
thousand miles in hot sunshine by a path
hitherto unknown ; the snug fireside changed
to the camp-fire under the stars; the market
in the village street to a yearly market ten
thousand miles beyond the sea. Hunger and
cold ceased to be dangers near at hand;
poverty and riches took on new colors;
masses of new information on a thousand
fresh subjects became general property.
With all these things for a background not
only did thought change and expand but the
physical type was altered. After occupying
portions of the continent for 50 or 60 years
the British race in Australia gave promise
of a virile nationality differing greatly from
that which occupied the British Islands and
still more greatly from any other on earth.
The nation took on definite political form
with the federation of the States, and estab-
lished its distinctiveness in the eyes of the
world during the Great War. The Austra-
lian type may be said to be now established. It
differs quite as widely from that found else-
where as the Roman type in its early and
most vigorous years differed from other kinds
of men in the Italian peninsula; and its
qualities in the view of Australians them-
selves are well worth preserving. That
being so, the chief national danger we have
to immediately face is not an armed attack,
but the serious borrowings from other peoples
of the things that go to alter and pervert the
Australian tone and spirit. We are in far
less danger of being swamped by the people
of an enemy nation than of being changed by
the subtle thought-influences of people who
are superficially like ourselves but essenti-
ally different. A good deal of attention has
been given already to the importation of
political nostrums quite .unsuited to our
needs. But there are many other un-
wanted importations. Our outdoor sports
are mostly British and have been with us
from the first; and as these have had much
to do with the making of the type, it is
reasonable to suppose that they will con-
tinue to preserve it. But with our amuse-
ments —the semi-intellectual enjoyments
which almost exactly correspond to the bor-
rowings of Rome from Greece—the case is
different. Our picture-shows, plays and
novels arc almost all borrowed; and the
greater number come from the large Ameri-
can cities. Whatever the problems of those
American cities may be, and however their
people may face the great future, the fact
stands that the influences at work there are
very different from those which have made
the best type of Australians; and it is im-
possible to continue to feed millions of Aus-
tralian minds with their thoughts without
altering and weakening our national exist-
ence. Already hideous idioms of New York
speech are displacing many genuinely Aus-
tralian phrases which we were accustomed
to hear; but this is a small matter compared
with the false outlook on Australian life
which is more and more in evidence. When
it is remembered that the reading of the
priceless Greek classics was one of the chief
forces which destroyed the Roman spirit, it
becomes pretty clear that the cheap and
merely meretricious productions of the
American stage and picture-show business
are a serious danger. Roman writers pro-
duced nothing in literature and art equal to
the things that undermined their nation ; yet
Rome itself, as a genuine human force, was
far more important than Greece. Australia
may not yet be able to produce picture
films better than those made in Los Angeles;
yet the Australian spirit and outlook may
easily be worth more in world values than
anything America can ever lend us. In
the light of the historical evidence the things
that may seem small to politicians are of
huge significance. Australian leaders of
thought will be strangely unwise if they allow
friendly foreign influences to twist out of
shape the great hope that has been nearly a
century and a half in the making.
THE LIARS.
One of the piffling ingenuities attached to
Federal elections, but not as yet generally to
State ones, is a regulation providing that, for
the period between the issue and the return
of the writ, articles bearing on the subjec;
must have attached the signature of the
alleged author. The intention was that the
politician might know the man who lied
about him, or spoke too much solemn truth
about him, so that he might pursue his critic,
should he happen to be an accessible indi-
vidual, such as a civil servant, with all the
fury of his malignant disposition. The idea
might be varied, or improved on, or, at least,
extended, by making the period during which
the writ is wandering on the face of the
earth a close season in another sense. In
addition to being a time when anonymous
scribes may not lie about the candidate, it
might also be a time when the candidate
might not lie about things in general, or, at
least, a time when he might not lie with im-
punity upon concrete matters which can be
put to the proof. If the proposed Law of
Purification was enforced the applicant for
a seat could be driven to reasonable accu-
racy about the past and the present; and,
though he could still give his perverted imagi-
nation a wide range concerning the future,
that would be of less importance than it is
now. If a Lang or a Dooley had to be
even moderately accurate about the pitiful
smallness of his accomplishment when lie
was in office, there would be only a mild and
feeble delusion about his tale of gigantic and
assured performances provided he gets back
to office. And the Law of Purification would
be no dead-letter. An enormous number of
people would have a keen desire to enforce
it; and as it would operate only once in a
while the community wouldn’t have much
chance to grow tired of it.
* * * *
The proposition is that a large number of
special Courts should commence to sit at
convenient centres on nomination day. they
could be presided over by barristers of good
repute, and of a certain number of years
standing, so that they might not bring too
fresh a mind to the Bench. These acting-
judges might belong to the State, or be hired
from some other State, In either case their
appointment would furnish jobs for a deserv-
ing class of men. The Courts would, if aeces*
sary, sit long hours and procedure would be
swift, for a delayed decision would be as bad
as no decision at all. Should procedure not
be swift enough the only remedy would be
to provide more Courts. Before any one ot
these tribunals it is proposed that am
candidate, or any howler on behalf or an>
candidate, could be brought by any DecT"
interested —and all the other side would be
interested. Having arrived he could be called
upon to produce chapter and verse tor an ■
statement he had made which was sufficiently
concrete to be reduced to chapter and verse,
such as a tale about local revenue, expend!
ture, taxation, deficit, surplus, the amount ot
land settlement effected by given Ministers
in a given time, unemployment and oven tne
Keeping or otherwise of the last °!
election promises, or the rise and tall ot
wages. Most of these matters could be
decided inside an hour by the production ot
books and documents such as are for san
to all and sundry at the Government 1 rma’p'
or some corresponding institution. jae
Foreign Trade nuisance, whose stock-m-tracie
is the alleged “prohibitive” tariff, coald ,
dispelled in a quarter of an hour by cm
production of the sworn figures dealing wit j
imports and exports. A statement having
been proved a lie, it could be declam
“black,” and its further use on any platform
during the election prohibited, a’u
penalty of disqualification if the per sis ten
offender was a candidate and very consum-
able fine if he wasn’t. The publication
the details would have an enlightening e
on the community and furnish good reaiun-,.
One result to be looked for is that the cam-


paign would become cleaner and more respect-
able as it went on, through almost the
entire stock-in-trade of one or more parties
having become “black,” and that isn’t the
usual way with campaigns. On the other
hand, of course, an effort might be made by
the worst elements to be clean and respect-
able at the beginning, and throw all the garb-
age at the last hour when it was too late for
the law to act; but if the Court remained
open till the return of the writ, it might
deal with offenders retrospectively.
Electoral campaigning has always been to
some extent a matter of lying, but in some
places it has now become a matter of such
monstrous lying that the fate of Sodom and
Gomorrah seems to impend unless some-
thing drastic is done. The over-supply of
misinformation is as demoralising in its way
as alcohol. Many a man of limited reading
loses whatever stock of political fact he
ever possessed and becomes unfit, through
imbecile delusions, to exercise the rights of
citizenship, all by reason of candidates and
the noisy hangers-on of candidates. Many
a candidate of the baser or stupider sort
gets out of the habit of knowing things, it
being so much easier and more sensational
to invent things, or to rely on the party
stock of inventions. Thus he gives up think-
ing what he thinks are thoughts, and what
might really have developed into thoughts
if given a chance. The need for doing work
when in office, always a serious business for
a crowd which doesn’t know how. is greatly
reduced when it answers almost as well to lie
to a short-memoried community about im-
aginary work done, there being no official
or judicial check upon the liar. It is a
matter of getting votes by false pretences,
but “uncouth crooks” are made up of false
pretences, helped out by ballot-boxes with
sliding panels. The possibility exists that
even the politician who washes the murky
linen of the Lang party in full view wasn’t
born much worse than other men, but
immunity makes the rowdy, and opportunity
makes the Ananias. It is quite likely that
after two, or at most three, elections, with
a competent and diligent Court to audit the
political prospectuses, even N.S.W. would
get a Parliament so different from the last
half-dozen that old inhabitants would ask
in amaze if it was a Parliament at all. This
would almost certainly be the case if, as an
additional reform, an end was made of
“privilege” as between members, so that when
one hon. gentleman falsely accused another
of drunkenness, rack-renting or venereal dis-
ease, the accused could seek satisfaction from
the civdl or criminal law like any other citi-
zen. To the member who avoids blackguard-
ism there is no privilege as between him and
his colleagues—merely a plentiful lack of it.
These changes should mark a new epoch in
Parliamentary management, especially the
change providing a Court for the review of
candidates’ assertions. After all, elections
seldom come oftener than once in three years.
Even if the Court operated for two months
(say six weeks before polling day and two
weeks after that event for clearing away the
final deposit of garbage) there would remain
“4 months to lie in, and that should suffice
for any liar.
BEHIND THE RUSSIAN VEIL WITH
TROTSKY.
Internal upheaval sooner or later beacons
as a tower in the Gethsemane of historic
movements. Neither integration nor dis-
integration can be permanent, but must be
occlusive. In Russia the Communist party
is fighting for its life on the gauntlet not of
its foe, but of its friend. Trotskyism is a
galloping flame in the land of Sovietism.
What neither blockade nor invasion could do
Trotsky may do with what is considerably
his creation, and which, it is charged, he
would have entirely so. As the coming of
Sovietic Communism altered the course of
history, so may its Trotskyfication deflect the
course through blood and fire and engulf
Russia as France was engulfed from 1789
until the end of Napoleon.
Of the phenomenon at present all that is
to be seen are words and warnings; but the
wise ever read between the lines. Taking
things as they seem, it is evident that not
since the Bernstein affair in Germany, or
the Millerand affair in France —excluding
the bigger eruption of 1914 to 1917 —-has
controversy on theory so disturbed the “revo-
lutionism” of two continents as to-day does
the “revisionism” of the maker of the Red
Army. The strange silence of the Commu-
nist press in Australia is not an echo of that
press elsewhere. The silence is due, one
thinks, to an instinctive feeling that Austra-
lian Communists are in the same boat as
Trotsky— he towards the official party of
his country, they towards the Labor party
of this country.
But what is Trotskyism (it is so termed
throughout Russia) ? From a reading of
oceanic speeches and articles, suggestive of
an attempt to drown a heretic in printer’s
ink, one gathers that it is chiefly an offence
against a patriotic credo, and therefore sedi-
tion the most damnable. There is no economy
of denunciation, or even of exposition, here.
Every commissar, every leader, every writer
of note has thought it a duty to express him-
self mountainously, and most of it is trans-
lated ; though there is but little in defence
of Trotsky. But what a power in the land
he must be since still he walks abroad!
In trying to probe to the essential mean-
ing of the passionate anti-TROTSKY agita-
tion, one finds the ease against the formerly-
worshipped hero —thousands of zealots would
now gladly boil him—to be three-quarters
doctrinal and one-quarter personal. Causes
celebres in ecclesiastical jurisdiction are sug-
gested with vivid parallelism as one encoun-
ters the emphasis on this or the other particle
of theoretic point, and is submerged in the
polemics of theses, ideological principles and
other varieties of acrobatic terminology. One
paragraph of the 40 or so constituting the
official resolution which sent Trotsky into
retirement will perhaps convey an inkling
of what the commotion is all about
In the most general form Comrade Trotsky’s
actions against the party as a whole can now be
described as an attempt to convert the ideology of
the Russian Communist party into a sort of modern-
ised (by Comrade Trotsky) Bolshevism without
Leninism. This is not Bolshevism. This is a revision
of Bolshevism. This is an attempt to substitute
Leninism by Trotskyism, i.e.. an attempt to sub-
stitute for the Leninist theory and tactics of inter-
national proletarian revolution that variety of Men-
shevism which the old Trotskyism represented and
which is represented to-day by the resurrected
“modern” Trotskyism. Essentially, modern Trotsky-
ism is a counterfeit of Communism approaching the
“European” model of pseudo-Marxism, i.e., in the
last resort, to “European” Social Democracy.
The foregoing is from the finding in last
January of “the Joint Plenum of the Central
Committee of the Communist party (two
against) and the Central Control Commis-
sion (one abstained from voting).” The
Plenum declared Trotsky’s continued chair-
manship of the Revolutionary military coun-
cil “impossible,” postponed to the next party
congress the question of Trotsky’s work in
the future, resolved to “develop the work of
the party in explaining throughout all the
ranks of the party the anti-Bolshevik charac-
ter of Trotskyism” and to “explain in a
popular manner to the non-party masses of
workers and peasants the meaning of the
deviations of Trotskyism and reveal its false
paths leading to the break-up of the alliance
between the working class and the peasan-
try,” warned Trotsky of divers pains and
penalties “in the event of any fresh attempt
on his part to violate or refuse to carry
out party decisions”—and declared the dis-
cussion closed!
What has happened in Russia is that the
tactics and theories applied in its revolutions,
and particularly to the culminating one in
1917, have by success been made sacrosanct;
and, since all eventful changes sentimentally
crystallise in personality, Leninism has be-
come a faith almost divine, and unquestion-
ably an officialdom almost priestly.
For several years Trotsky’s writings have
been easily the foremost freelancing within
the Communist party. Trotsky seems to
have felt secure in his own "sacredness until
that sanctuary was violated by colleagues
unable to stand his subtle opposition any
longer. The fifth World Congress of the
Communist International and the Thirteenth
Party Conference of the Russian C.P. con-
demned such opposition. In his “1917”
Trotsky re-opened the discussion. An Eng-
glisli translation of a review from the Moscow
Pravda was furnished to the Communist
press of America with an instruction that
it was to be printed, but not “1917” or any
chapter thereof!
The heart of Trotsky’s offending, how-
ever, is his renewal of his old “Theory of
Permanent. Revolution,” described by Lenin
as “an eclectical attempt to combine petty
bourgeois Menshevist opportunism with
‘Left’ phrases and an attempt to leap over
the peasantry.” Trotsky's standpoint,
asserts Bela Kttn, “is one which has nothing
in common with Bolshevism,” because “it
involves a disavowal of the role played by the
peasantry as a revolutionary force” and “the
complete denial of the internal vitality of the
Russian Revolution” without aid from the
proletariat of Western Europe. Portion
of the charges against him at the
Plenum was that in reference to the
Brest Peace he failed to understand that the
peasantry had had enough fighting and “he
conducted a policy that nearly cost the
Revolution its head.” He was further
charged that in the period of N.E.P. (New
Economic Policy) he urged a line of action
“which might have led to the collapse of
the Revolution.” He held the view, records
Soicolnikov, “that in order to enable the
organisation of production to bear all its
fruit, it was necessary to transform the
trade unions into organs immediately orga-
nising production and controlling its econo-
mics.”
Imperfect as are analogies and compari-
sons one ventures the deduction that in broad
outline Trotsky" is an Australian Com-
munist. otherwise a catasti’ophic revolutionist.
He believes in “abrupt changes” and not in
reform, in the proletariat alone and not
in the peasantry (for the two are bound
to collide), in all power to the unions and
none for others, and in Internationalism as
sole emancipator. Here in Australia
Trotsky would logically be against the
“piecemeal” Labor party, while his Russian
foemen would now be part and parcel of
that party. Terrorism apart, Lenin was in
his practice the sponsor and applier of Labor
legislation. The conflict in Russia is of a
piece with the conflict we have in the
Australian movement as to whether step-
by-step Constitutionalism or one-swoop Dic-
tatorship is the road to power. Trotsky
is for the philosophy and plan of the Dic-
tatorship to its farthest. His judges are for
the State as supreme. Trotsky is the com-
plete Marxist, true to the thesis of the dia-
lectic. His accusers are for Private Pro-
perty for the Peasantry and for helpful Capi-
talism : they stand for Opportunism, Com-
promise and “Hold, Enough!”
Both Trotsky" and his critics might con-
test this summary; but barring that acts in
both camps oft-times put theories to the
blush, and thus mix things awkwardly, it
is. one believes, an approximately-correct
mirroring of the Russian scene in its kinema-
tographie Machiavellianism.
R.S. ROSS.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Age and Respectability.
With a State election due next year
Queensland is beginning to ask what is the
outlook and whether there is any prospect
of replacing the crowd in power in the State
Parliament by a better party or a better
class of men. The defects of the governing
party are patent to everyone. Their finance
is utterly deplorable, and apparently beyond
any hope of betterment; they openly kow-
tow 7 to the public servants, particularly to
the railwaymen and the police, until it be-
gins to look as if the public had no rights
at all where its so-called “servants” are
concerned. Yet these men survive, and may
continue so to do by reason of a certain
political nous which Fate has denied to their
opponents. In the first place, Labor is not
tied up to the “old political hack” tradi-
tion to the same extent as its opponents.
The late Toowoomba election was a strik-
ing example of this. The National-Liberal
organisations put forward James Tolmie. a
decent, elderly citizen, who served as Min-
ister a good few years back, was defeated some
three times, and yet had the hardihood to come
again. There was never a grain of inspira-
tion in ToeMie ;he was simply a plain Tory
of the old school. Yet Liberalism ran him,
presumably “on his record,” and Toowoomba
turned him down with a thump. Labor, on
the other hand, looked round, and in place
of turning to its old defeated candidates, of
whom there were several locally available,
selected Llewellyn, an energetic and popu-
lar ambulance man, known to practically
everybody in the district, who would pro-
bably have scored a win had he been run
by either side. The Opposition, which now
calls itself “the Oountx-y Progressive party"
(it changes its label about every year),
is sadly burdened with ancient hacks.
The young men of Liberalism say
openly: “They don’t want young fel-
lows in our party: they reckon a man’s
no good till lie’s long past 40.” Unless Lib-
eralism can rid itself of this the future is
far from promising. Another circumstance
that militates strongly against the Anti-
Labor crowd is the fact that some of its
leaders are “produce” middlemen. Now, not
only is the middleman anathema to political
Labor, which exploits masses and classes in
a quite different and possibly much more effec-
tive fashion, but the Queensland farmer him-
self lias a deep-rooted prejudice against the
10 per cent, commission class. The “Country
Progressive party” will never maintain its
cohesion if the Premier of the Anti-Labor
crowd is a fruit- or produce-agent middle-
man. Another of the great buttresses
of the “old political hack” supersti-
tion is the pre-selection humbug which
is potent in Anti-Labor circles. The Liberal
organisations seem to be dominated by a
desire to put in candidates who combine the
two great desiderata of Age and Respect-
ability : as these cliques are sometimes aged
and respectable themselves the natural result
follows. If Liberalism would only discard
pre-selection and leave that worn-out
swindle to sliding-panel enthusiasts, there
might be a chance of getting new blood into
the party. At present new blood is re-
garded with timid suspicion. Last, the
Nat.-Lib. United-Country Progressives lack a
leader. They have been 10 years in Opposition
through this defect; and, apparently, they
suffer from it now as badly as ever they did.
The lack of encouragement to young men
may explain the woeful want.
The Habit of Declaring Things “Black.”
Some practices—the burning of witches, for
instance —break down in time because of
their inherent unsouridness. One of the next
to go ought to be the modern trade-union
trick of declaring persons, things and places
“black.” To the average unionist “black”
and “white” mean nothing until the union
boss tells him. Then, being sheep-headed
and loyal to “the working class,” he does
as he is told. The declaring of Walsh Island
Government dockyards black by the Engine-
drivers’ Association illustrates how the
tinng works. None of the other unions was
consulted —neither the Boilermakers, Amal-
gamated Engineers, Australian Engineers,
Blacksmiths, Ship Painters and Dockers
Iron Workers’ Assistants nor Shipwrights.
They knew nothing of the engine-drivers’
claims until just before the latter knocked
off work, hurried to the Trades Hall, held
a meeting and declared the island “black” —
meaning that anyone who continued to work
was a “scab.” The procedure is right over
the odds. Without doubt the engine-drivers
could set up a strong case for more money,
and possibly the other unions would have
agreed with them had they been consulted ;
but if the merits of their case entitle them
to lock out half a dozen other unions, then
assuredly others will take a turn some day,
and will expect the same sheepish acquies-
cence under the same ' threat of scabbing.
In the Walsh Island case the allied unions,
sore at the treatment handed them by their
comrades, did not stand the strain, but went
back to work. So unionism has suffered;
and it is time organised labor took steps to
prevent sudden declarations of industrial
war which threaten the peace all round.
The miners, more especially the -wheelers,
clippers, sidlers and trappers, are addicted
to this vice, and more recently the seamen
have come into prominence by declaring
ships in turn black, wdiite and piebald, re-
gardless of the effect on the stewards, cooks,
coalies and wharf-laborers. They carried it
so far that a week or two ago the Ships’
Painters and Dockers’ officials decided that
unless the seamen agreed to lift the “black”
embargo on the Volumnia. they (the Paint-
ers and Dockers) would declare the whole
of Mort’s Dock “black.” Under pressure of
the iron-trade unions the seamen capitu-
lated ; but not until much uneasiness had
been caused and capital had put a bit more
aside to provide for contingencies. Labor
can’t realise too soon that all this unrest
has to be dearly paid for. No Australian
contractor will submit a price for a job
these days without adding a large sum to
cover contingencies; and very often the job
is then not done at all. and so men lose
employment.
A Frost and an Example.
Points of resemblance can be traced between
the development of Canada and the non-
development of Australia. Canada began
from the east, and wanted to push settlement
across to a great port in the far west, be-
cause it was a long way round by sea. Aus-
tralia began from the south and wanted to push
settlement across to a great port in the north,
because it was a long way round by sea.
Canada began the construction of a railway
from sea to sea in 1871. and finished it,
and built more railway. And the population
of its farthest-out province, British Colum-
bia, moved like this ;
1871.. 10,586 1901.. 178,657
1881.. 49,459 1911.. 392,480
1891.. 98,1731 1921.. 524,582
Our own Northern Territory didn't progress
and doesn’t; but, then, the through railway
is wanting. It was paid for with a land-
grant, like the Canadian-Pacific, and paid
for much more lavishly : but instead of the
work being entrusted to honest business men,
it was left to political shufflers who lack
vision, honor, patriotism and enterprise. The
Northern Territory hasn’t all the internal
resources of British Columbia; so. though
it has a port which is better situated than
Vancouver for commerce —a port destined to
be the site of ono of the world’s great cities,
according to the Ministers’ own imported
port-expert—it might not go forward at the
same pace as British Columbia. But as
its resources are not. diminishing there is
no reason for it going backward save the
neglect and blatant incapacity of the vote-
hunting -politicians who run the show. Given
the same means of communication as British
Columbia has, and a land-policy calculated
to attract settlers (which the leasehold appa-
rently doesn’t), some measure of progress
couldn’t be avoided, and with 40,000 or 50,000
white inhabitants the Territory could be
set up in business for itself, so that it might
be a State instead of a miserable Problem.
Queensland started full self-government with
28,000 people, Westralia with 48,000 and
Tasmania with between 30,000 and 40,000.
But there were political pioneers in those
days. Now there are Pearces instead.
Motherhood.
Two out of 20 letters on the subject raised
by “A Family Doctor” (B. 30/4/’25), the
lirst by “Clinic Doctor" :
“A Family Doctor,” on the subject ot' women
and care during pregnancy, nobly upholds the view
of the old school. Evidence is accumulating rapidly
of the beneficial effects of pre-natal care. The best
result so far published by the new school is one
death in two thousand confinements extending over
a period of four years at the Louise Margaret
Hospital, Aldershot (Eng.), amongst soldiers’ wives.
If ho is still unconvinced, let him come and see
what is actually being done in Sydney in the ante-
natal clinies at our large maternity hospitals. He
will find that, so far from objecting to the necessary-
pre-natal examinations, the expectant mother wel-
comes the idea and goes away rejoiced in the
knowledge that her case is being carefully watched.
She knows and her husband knows that if she ’s
one of the unfortunates who never should have
conceived, the greatest security lies in the fact that
the doctor knows all about it beforehand and in
time to take her into hospital for treatment that
will give her somewhere about a 2000-to-l
chance of surviving, and if it is humanly possible
will present her with a living infant into the
bargain. The methods of ante-natal examination
take a little trouble to learn, but it is up to the
“Family Doctor” to march with the times and
acquire the necessary skill to detect abnormalities
in the bud. The intelligtnce of the intermediate
class of women is no less acute than that of the
hospital class who so readily grasp the advantages
of ante-natal supervision. If from prudishness or a
desire to save the fee, the middle-class patient
refuses the security that these new methods confer,
then, if an avoidable disaster does occur, the
onus of responsibility- must be on the patient her-
self.
And “A.M..T.” puts the mother's view: —
I am convinced that the advocates of pre-natal
examination of women are suffering from one severe
handicap. If women, they have not themselves
been pregnant. If men, they- have not studied the
psychology of the pregnant woman. Any attempt
to institute a reg#lar examination of women at
pre-natal clinics would provoke intense opposition
from expectant mothers. I am glad to note “Family
Doctor’s” assurance that the death-rate of 1 in
250 which occurs among parturient women is chiefly
due to abnormalities. Before my last infant arrived
the daily papers were suffering from one of their
sporadic outbursts about maternity mortality-. So
fearsome were some of the so-called statistics quoted
that I soon found myself suffering from the worst
sort of apprehensions o’ nights. I wondered what
was in store for me, and was just about at the
farewell-letter stage when it occurred to me to visit
the matron of the hospital to which I was going
for the event. She, perhaps shrewdly suspecting that
1 was getting a bit jumpy, informed me that
during the 30 years in which she had kept a
maternity hospital she had presided at well over
1000 births, and had never lost either a mother or
a child. That pulled me together, and thenceforth
I skipped all newspaper correspondence on the
subject.

A Muffled Roar from the Past.
The Office Curate’s discourse on the Sabbath :
The protest of the Sydney Council of the Churches
against the holding of a Cabinet meeting on Sunday
sounds a little like the roaring of an extinct saurian
of the great Mud Age. Not but that the protest is
“respectful,” which by the look of his fossil teeth and
scales the saurian never was. The resemblance lies
in the fact that it is a fossil roar and not likely
to be dangerous, though the particular mud strata
to which the sound belongs are by- no means as
ancient as the tone seems to indicate. The British
Sunday—Scotchmen and some of their nonconformist
imitators call it Sabbath—was born and bred in
the seventeenth century. The first day of the week
was the special Christian holiday on which religious
meetings were held from very early times; but
there was no attempt made by the Churches of Rome
or the East to identify that holiday with the Jewish
Sabbath. In all Southern European lands it remains
a holiday. The afternoon is devoted to sports and
general’ enjoyment ; and this was once the case in
every northern land also. Luther did not insist on
any great change; and even the grim John Knox in
his fierce reformation of Scotland left the simple
Sunday amusements alone.
It was when the Westminster Assembly got down
to the job of trying to make the Christian circle
fit the square of its own sombre beliefs that a
Sabbath was evolved. To set aside one of the Ten
Commandments as obsolete seemed to the Assembly
an unwarranted act and one which would leave the
way open to the declaration that many other things
were obsolete also. The divines assembled must fix
their Sabbath about the neck of England somehow;
and the easiest thing was to transfer it to the
Sunday. The way was made the smoother by the
fact that such a Sunday was very much to their
peculiar taste. The noisy sports of their religious
opponents had always seemed to them to have a
special connection with the Devil; and they were
determined to make the Devil rest on Sunday as far
as law and gospel could accomplish the feat. Puritan-
ism had its short innings and sat back to slowly
develop into modern nonconformity; but the kind
of Sunday it had made stuck to England. It is
true that the original games and amusements came
back to some extent under the restored Stuarts ; but
the Church of England did not look kindly on the
Sunday sport. A quiet Sunday suited the general
religious idea and made the work of the churchman
simpler. While opposed in a general way to the
Puritanical theory of things, the Vicar of Mudhurst
and the Rector of Beerthorpe thought it a good
notion that there should be as few counter-attractions
as possible on the day of his weekly display. In
Scotland the Westminster Confession was accepted by
the great mass of the people as a sacred book; and
there the Sabbath-Sunday became a day of pain and
tribulation only mollified by whisky and heated
religious controversy.
In England, by the early nineteenth century, an
accepted day of mild and solemn gloom was the
general rule; but about 1860 some members of what
was known as the Broad Church party found the
courage to say that a game of cricket on the village
green need not be regarded as causing any special

knocked loudly on the gate and churchmen have
been called to defend more vital points in their
faith than the observance of Sunday. There has
been a wide emancipation from the manufactured

The death of Bill Massey, Maoriland’s
long-distance Prime Minister, recalls the
earlier lighting days when, as leader of a
little party of 10, he kept his end up against
the gathered might of the Liberalism of the
day. All the big-guns and all the votes
appeared to be on the other side; but the
press was about evenly divided throughout
the country. Unfortunately it was a press
that thought poorly of Massey as a leader,
though it consistently attacked his political
enemies. The little Conservative group
facing the Ministers had not one really effec-
tive speaker. llerries spoke haltingly and
almost stammeringly, though his matter was
good and he was a Trojan for work; Jimmy
Allen was clever at times, but tedious be-
yond belief. Yet not one Ministerial measure
went unchallenged, nor one vital clause of a
bill without keen criticism. Massey was a
host in himself. When he became too earnest
over any matter his voice got out of control,
and he sang his indignation in a strange high
falsetto. But he was never really out of
temper, and never really lost his grip. His
final success was a triumph of monumental
patience. Often wrong, but always sincere,
he stuck to his post till the Liberal party
broke by its own strength; then he began
his cpiiet rule, and Maori land woke up to an
appreciation of Massey, the man. and pre-
sently extended it to the party behind him.
which was lai'gely a reflection of his own
personality.
‘•Zeno”: It would be interesting to know
whether the Labor party has any fixed policy
with regard to the establishment of new in-
dustries in Australia, and, if so, what it
Recently the Labor Daily, the official organ
of the party in N. S. Wales, expressed de-
light at the establishment of Ford's factories
in Australia. This is as it ought to be, for
every new industry adds to the productive
wealth and labor-employing power of the
community. Yet when Arthur Griffith,
as Labor Minister for Works, took steps to
induce the Broken Hill people to establish
their steelworks at Newcastle —lie deepened
the channel, resumed portion of an aban-
doned colliery railway, and helped the co.
to obtain a lease of a block of Crown land —
he was censured by the Labor Conference on
the ground that he was “helping the rar
Man.” The fact that his action meant pro-
viding regular employment for 10,000 Aus-
iralian workmen in a key industry, and re-
taining in Australia the millions of money
we were annually paying for imports of
iron and steel, went for nothing. Not that
the opinion of the conference worried
(Iriffith very much. He got up and told
the delegates that, notwithstanding their
censure, lie knew he had done the right thing,
and that in similar circumstances he would
do it again.
“X.N.0.”: “Windsor” (B. 14/5/25)
objects to my levelling an accusation of dis-
courtesy against LT.S.A. - official circles when
they have referred openly to the Japanese
• s the possible enemy for whose warning the
present naval manoeuvres are being staged.
My critic adds that England’s avoidance of
the same kind of rudeness didn’t postpone
the war with Germany. Very probably not;
but it is not before the trouble comes that
the effect is felt, it is afterwards. For years
past Germany has been desperately seeking
to clear herself of the stigma of having de-
liberately brought about the late war; but
she cannot produce a scrap of evidence that
British Ministers regarded such a war as
inevitable. If Germany could produce an
official Admiralty pronouncement, of pre-war
years telling the R.N. that fleet exercises
were being planned to combat an “attack
such as Germany might make,” England
could not escape the charge of haying at
any rate anticipated the war. Then _ Ger-
many could well say: “Why, you practically
told us you were going to war with us.
That is what America is how telling Japan
in practically so many words. “Windsor”
may call it hypocrisy and humbug; I call it
bad manners and worse diplomacy.
The Privy Council has reminded the N. S.
Wales Valuer-General that “unimproved
land valhe” means unimproved land value,
and that the law of the State expressly says
so. In the case under notice, the Valuer-
General’s Department decided that a hotel
property was worth so much altogether; then
if subtracted the agreed-upon value of the
buildings and other premises suitable for
the licensed trade, and declared the remainder
to be the “unimproved” value of the land.
The Land and Valuation Court and the State
Supreme Court held that it was right to
thus find unimproved values by taking into
account improvements that had been made
by erecting buildings and getting them
licensed. Both Courts either overlooked or
interpreted with large liberality the behest
of the law that unimproved value should be
ascertained on the basis of what the fee-
simple might be expected to realise "assum-
ing that the improvements, if any, thereon
. . .hnd not been ; nadc .” The law lords in Eng-
land declared it "completely wrong to add
the value of the buildings "in a calculation
in which you are told to assume that no
building is there,” and ordered a revaluation
of the "bare land” without any consideration
of licensed premises thereon. The decision
will carry a long way. It will assuredly
reduce assessments which included in values
various external improvements, such as street-
and path-construction. And it will deprive
a lot of shire and municipal bodies of easy
money which they have been easily spending.
On Sydney's North Shore line the land on
which a hotel stood was valued at £l5O per
foot, though the contiguous block was not

THE FREE TRADE FETICH.
“The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, in a deputation to the Prime Minister (Mr. Baldwin),
pointed out that the union had paid £4,000,000 in benefits to members during the depression and
thousands of skilled mechanics had recently migrated to the United States. The union urged that the
Government should immediately find employment for skilled mechanics, particularly in the electri-
fication of railways, bridge building and Empire development.”— Cable.

at £lOOO. There will be no more of these
idiosyncrasies unless the Act is altered, and
it -will be a very difficult matter to get that
done.
It is always pleasing to hear of a new in-
dustry, and a cheery fuss is being made
about a proposal to make paper out of Aus-
tralian hardwoods. Of course, the people
who are at the back of the scheme ask for
adequate Protection. Australia i.s the least-
timbered in proportion to area on a list of
21 countries for which figures are available,
and it is doing very little to improve its
supply. On the other hand, the making of
woollen goods is a real Australian industry,
this country being as well off for sheep as
it i.s ill-provided with trees; yet its imports
of woollen goods amount now to four
or five times the value of its im-
ports of newsprint. Further, the wool-
len industry is doing its great perish
almost entirely for want of adequate
Protection; and the match industry,_ the en-
gineering and electro-plate industries and
others are going the same road. The Bul-
letin wishes the paper industry well; all
the same, if there is but a limited amount of
boost available for higher Protection, it hopes
the wool and the match and the engineering
industries will have first attention.

Education in the North:
\ full measure of credit must be given to h. ■
Urol'H art Administrator of the Northern Territory,
for his handling of education matters in his diocese.
He found things in a bad way. The schoo a
Darwin was staffed with two qualified teachers and
a headmaster who was his own inspector. The
scholars were such a rabble of all colors as it
would be hard to beat anywhere. Most of the
students called the headmaster by his Christian
name, and the language of the playground could
only be equalled by the Bolshevik elders df some oi
the scholars. Along the railway line to Emungalan
were families whose members had never seen a
blackboard and whose only schooling was provided
bv tired parents. In one case the eldest of a family
of five was unable to tell the time of day by the
clock The Administrator’s first recommendation
was that the N.T. should be promptly linked up
with one of the State Education Departments—pre-
ferably Queensland. The report and recommenda-
tion was tiled away with the dusty reports of previous
Administrators. Urquhart, however, was not to be
denied, and he revived the subject on every possible
occasion. At last even Pearce was compelled to
take notice, and give consent. To-day improvements
are noticeable on all sides and qualified assistants
are now the rule, not the exception. Colored
children have classes separate from the whites;
easily-obtained scholarships that will take the winner
to Queensland have been granted, and an inspector
from Queensland pays an annual visit. Most of the
higher subjects are now taught free, and an itinerary
teacher along the line has already worked wonders
in the mental outfit and physical deportment of
the population there. Herein Urquhart has done
a big thing for White Australia.

The easiest way of getting killed in Mel-
bourne seems to be to go out walking; up
to May 11 during this year no people who have
met motor-cars have given the Coroner a job.
Fines for reckless driving and for drunken-
ness whilst in charge of a car, with or with-
out suspension of licenses, do not seem to check
the orgy. Some of the trouble may be traced
to the readiness with which licenses are
granted, application being practically a for-
mality ; also, it is quite safe to say that
there are any number of unlicensed drivers
cheerfully taking the risks of discovery with
the knowledge that nothing very terrible will
happen even if they are discovered. In
Sydney the frequent curiosity of traffic cops
regarding the license of motor-men is re-
garded sometimes as a nuisance; but any
average person's accfuaintances in Melbourne
will include a score or so of motor-owners
who have never yet been asked to produce
their authority to drive. In several recent
accidents unlicensed drivers have been in-
volved, but apparently it would never have
been discovered that they were unlicensed
but for the accidents.

A British firm has at last produced a shell
which will pierce the strongest armor. Had-
eield’s, who are responsible for the dis-
covery, are the parent of lladfield’s (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., of Alexandria, Sydney. The
difference between the English firm and its
Australian offshoot is that a wise War Office
encourages the parent to instal the machinery
for providing the nation with its thews of
war when an emergency arrives, whereas
the Australian Defence Department leaves
the matter to chance. Still, Hadfiei.d’s, of Aus-
tralia, have already manufactured for indus-
trial purposes over 100 different grades of
steel, and it is some consolation to have
such a concern on the premises. Some day
it will be an important direct factor in
national defence; meantime it is an important
indirect factor because it is helping in the
establishment and development of many in-
dustries, and that means population, and
population means security.

“Sol. M.” on some possibilities:—.
The Australian Commissioner to the United State?
reports that the depression in the woollen industry
there is largely due to the fact that Uncle S. i>
struggling to meet the instalments on his time-
payment motor-car, and has to wear cheaper clothes,
and to wear them longer. He isn’t so particular
about his clothes, too. when the lower 75 per cent,
of his body and soul are hidden inside the tir
Lizzie. Then by reason of the wholesale purchase
of radio sets, largely on time-payment, he has tc
further economise on his clothes; but as he stay-
at home and has his entertainment brought to him
instead of going out in search of it, almost any
clothes will do. In fact, owing to the great im
provements in heating arrangements hardly any
clothes will do. A lurking suspicion exists that
through motoring when he is out and sitting rounr
the radio set when he isn’t out, the pedestrian art
may die out, and the usefulness of the race, regarded
as infantry, be impaired. Last year the Automobih
Chamber of Commerce (New York) published at
estimate that there were 13,464,608 passenger motor
vehicles in the U.S., and 2,383,216 in all the rest
of the world. There being a car to every sever
Yankees, with a very unpleasant but not wholly
impossible degree of compression the whole natioi
(ould get aboard at once and drive away, and nevei
come back. But these are not the only points o
interest among U.S. records. The Republic ne\c
had a complete registration system for births, deaths
marriages and divorces like other States, but loca
records cover, or did cover, nearly 90 per cent, o
Ihe ground. Hence this line in the “Statesman
Year Hook’': “Marriage rate per 10,000 (for 1916,
based on total population, 105. Divorce rate pci
10,000. based on total population, 112.” Possibly
when two are made one that is reckoned as on<
marriage, and when one is made two again that i
counted as a pair of divorces. Anyhow, it is i
dark saying, and the lack of subsequent figure 1
makes it mo lighter.

Evidence of the striking power of aireraf!
in naval warfare has been accumulating
since the Great War. Brig.-Gen. Mitchell
assistant chief of the U.S. Air n
evidence before a special committee of Con-
gress a few months ago, made sensational
disclosures. The U.S. Air Service, iindei
Mitchell, has been testing naval machines
for several years. Operations began _in
earnest in 1021. Flying-boats, dropping
ISOlb.-bombs, made short work of tlm ex-
German submarine Ull7. Every "pill
struck the target, which was split from stem
to stern. “This result,” said the assistant
air chief, “was a severe jolt for those who
still adhered to the old theories.” A day
or two later the ex-Hun destroyer GlO2 was
handed over to the naval airmen. Again
the accuracy of the attack was remarkable,
every bomb going where it was directed.
Next on the list was the cruiser Frankfurt,
upon which the bombs fell so fast that the
attack could not be stopped before mortal
injury was done to the vessel. Finally, the
ex-German battleship Ostfriesland, with the
scars of the battle of Jutland still upon her.
met her doom. Seven airplanes took part
in the attack. The first 20001 b.-bomb did its
work, and the remaining machines, flying
rapidly in single column, all registered hits,
with the result that inside of four minutes
the battleship was converted into a tangled
mass of wreckage. If Australia wishes to
keep two jumps ahead of any possible aggressor
in the near or distant future, there must be
studied development of this arm of the ser-
vice. “An aeroplane dropping a bomb from
a height of 10.000 ft.,” declares British Air
Chief Trenchard, “will be more accurate
than future gunfire at 40,000yd5.”

POLITICAL
Tackled on the score of having marched
in a Brisbane procession with Communists
flaunting Moscow mottoes, Charlton, the Fed-
eral Labor leader, pleaded that he “could
not see what was behind him." Exactly.
Labor leaders like Charlton and Lang
are never curious as to what is behind them.
It doesn’t pay.
Having undertaken to g i- ve all rural
workers the 44-lionr week, land-agent Lang is
making desperate eiiorts to persuade the
N. S. Wales farmers that it will be a mere
drop out of the bucketful of prosperity lie has
in jstore for them. At Griffith he promised
the Murrumbidgee irrigation-settlers conces-
sions amounting to three-quarters of a million
at least. And at Wagga, in typical land-agent
language, he alleged that- "no greater bene-
fits had ever been offered to primary pro-
ducers than those which would flow if the
Labor party was given power" :
A grand conference of producers and consumers
would be called. If that conference recommended
that certain subsidies were necessary in the interests
of better marketing, the Labor Government. would
pay them. If the conference said that certain legis-
lation was necessary for the protection of the
primary producers, then that legislation would lie
passed. No Government could know what was best
in the interests of consumers and farmers better
than the farmers and consumers themselves. The
only legislation Labor would ask those two classes
to accept was that which they themselves asked for.
The “consumers” will be city i trade-union
officials, as a matter of course. If the
farmers imagine that any conference, “grand"
or otherwise, with that sort of people will
bring them higher prices for their wheat,
maize, lucerne, butter, milk, cream, cheese
and so forth, they are greener than anything
they grow.
A lot of the mush offered to N. S. Wales
electors by the swarm of Labor politicians
from other States is difficult to swallow.
This, for example :
Mr. Seullin, M.P. (Vic.), in a speech at New-
town, said the ideals of Communism and Socialism
were identical. But they represented different
methods, and the Labor party would not “stand for"
Communist methods.
Nevertheless. Scullin’s crowd “stands for"
Walsh, of the Seamen’s Union, and his
methods, which methods have destroyed the
Commonwealth Government line of steamers
and resulted in a noticeable increase of
Japanese tonnage in Australian ports.
Tliough Walsh is an avowed Communist, a
wrecker of Australian industry and an enemy
of the White Australia policy, he was
admitted to the recent Vic. Labor Confer-
ence as a delegate from his “revolutionary”
union. Scullin was also a delegate, and
there is no record of his having objected
to Walsh’s presence or being ashamed of
his company.
The Country party militants in Victoria
are not submitting to the endorsement of
the Federal Pact by what they allege was a
trick. After the conference ex-Minister
Stewart held a meeting of his supporters,
who they claim are an actual majority of
farmer delegates; and a skeleton organisa-
tion, using the machinery of the Farmers’
Union, has since been showing some activity.
The present idea is that it will oppose not
only Nationalists, but all Country party
members who favor the Pact. The Pact
threatens to be a very leaky ark when the
election floods arrive.
In refusing to increase the Queensland
basic wage of £4 per week (it is 2s. per
week more in N. S. Wales) the Full Bench
of the Arbitration Court stated that "the
direct increase in the cost of the 44-hour
week to the Queensland Government, includ-
ing the railways, will be about £300,000" —
per annum, of course. On this basis, the
concession which Solomon Lang has pro-
mised the N.S.W. Government employees
would mean an additional expenditure of
£900,000 p.a. at least. Yet the blundering
house-agent insinuates that it wouldn’t in-
volve increased taxation.
After all, there will be contests for only
eight of the 17 vacancies in the Vic. Leg.
Council. D. L. McNamara, W. J. Beckett
and ,T. 11. Disney, the Labor members for
East. North and West Melbourne, go back
unopposed; so does 11. I. Cohen (Liberal)
at Melbourne. In the country three Libs,
and two Cocky members (one of the two is
MIXED DRINKS.
YOUNG NUSTRALIA : "I'm afraid these Fusion cocktails arc not agreeing with me
very well!"
Goudie, Minister for Works) have had their
tickets renewed. Labor’s only try for a
new seat is at South Melbourne; but Edgar,
sitting M.L.C. for East Yarra, is being
threatened by an Independent Lib., and the
Country party is providing extra candidates
for six country seats —even in the Northern
District, which is already held by a C.P.
man, W. 11. Day. Some of the Agrarians
have Labor leanings, and may’ alter the
balance in the aloof House.
Piddington, K.C.. of N.S.W., who isn't
accused of being a cheerful man, lately de-
livered a lecture on the white Austrafian
race considered as a perishing institution.
He based his melancholy on the declining
birth-rate. It looks bad; but on a list of 18
whole countries only S’Africa (white popu-
lation) and'Canada show better for increase
of population by the arrival and survival of
baby. Australia acquires only 2380 babies
where Japan gets 3420, Spain 3050 and Italy
3040. But Australia adds 1407 to its popu-
lation by surplus of babies over burials, while
the other three add 966, 460 and 811 re-
spectively. A huge birth-rate mostly, means
that the family recklessly buys a new baby
because the old one is dead, and sometimes
the old baby dies so fast that it is difficult
to replace it with the new r one. On mere
figures Australia would be doing exceedingly
well but for the crazed policy, unknown in
other lands, which crowds all the State capi-
tals, and the Federal capital, and nearly all
the old population and practically all the
new population (native and imported) into
a corner of the country.
In Kweichow Province, China, people
have been selling their children for a handful
of rice and eating the leaves of trees and
each other when the supply of foliage ran
out. Although rich and prosperous provinces
adjoin it, it will be compelled to starve for
the simple reason that it has not a single
line of railway. Pearce proposes to establish
a huge new State in the Far North that is to
carry a large population : but up to date lie
has made no mention of linking up his pro-
vince with the other centres by completing
the North-South railway. The notion that
this latest white elephant in its isolation will
support more than a few Commissioners and
the prevalent number of Binghis is rooted
in deception and founded on delusion.
Banners of many a strange device figured
in the Brisbane demonstration on Labor
Day. The most striking group carried in-
scriptions which shouted for revolution, ex-
pressed admiration for “Soviet Russia” and
demanded the entrails of the wagepayer,
otherwise the “capitalist. ' Walking humbly
with this literature and in this company
were a number of State Ministers and Fed-
eral Labor-leader Charlton. All the Com-
munists who don't belong to the Communist
League are eligible to enter the modern
Labor party, and the McCormacks and Langs
and Charltons have to be monstrous civil
to them.
The fixing of the dates for the Vic. Ilpnah
Chambah triennial election was delayed a
while by a horrible discovery. Retiring
members are entitled to hold their seats till
midnight oir Thursday, June 4, and to be
paid up till that date and hour at the rate of
£2OO a year. New members are also sup-
posed to be “reimbursed” as from 12.1 a.m.
on election day. Now June 4 was the date
tentatively chosen for the election: but then
somebody reflected that, if that day were
chosen, new members would be paid for a
whole day for which old members also would
have to be paid. The discovery hung every-
thing up till a couple of Ministers calcu-
lated that the extra cost would most likely
be well under a fiver; and then the machine
was allowed to go ahead.
A Commission was lately appointed in
Queensland to find out wiiat effects the mass
immigration of southern Europeans is hav-
ing. Up North the scarcity of opinions was
most noticeable, for all agreed that there
were too many immigrants already, that
the Italians are not menacing wages or
living standards, that they are good unionists
and demand everything the law entitles them
to and sometimes more, and that they live
as well as the Britisher when they are able
to. No mention was made of the dubious
whiteness and probable blackness of these
new unionists. They are unionists, and that
satisfies the A.W.U. In Ingham district
shopkeepers are forced to employ Italian-
speaking assistants. Thus and otherwise
the Britisher is becoming Italianised instead
of the Italian becoming British, and that
is the bad feature of the case.
The cable tells that London Daily Tele-
graph has been saying that war in Austra-
lian waters is impossible, that there, is
nothing here to fight about, that Britain’s
practical evacuation of the biggest ocean
wouldn’t matter, and that “the man-o’-war
has not yet been designed which can steam
the enormous distances separating Pacific
nations, and then be in a condition to fight."
Perhaps not; but something has been de-
signed. At the end of last century a first-
class U.S. battleship raced down the Pacific
coast of Mexico and South America, and
up the other side, and started to fight the
Spaniards on arrival without even going
home for a wash. Von Spec’s squadron had
been pretty well over the Pacific when it
met Cradock’s off the S. American shore, and
destroyed it. And though Rodjestvenski's
very-long-distance fleet wasn’t good enough
to beat the Japanese, it could have licked
most of the Pacific navies, and it fought like
the deuce whether it was in condition or not.
Nations find plenty to fight about in the
Pacific, and Australia should note the fact.
To fit up and equip the metropolitan
auxiliary hospital at Caulfield, acquired from
the Commonwealth Government, the Vic.
Ministry has spent just on £59,000. Mel-
bourne Hospital will manage the place, which
will be an auxiliary for all the city hospitals.
It is not exactly what Melbourne Hospital
wanted when it made the clamor about short-
age of accommodation. The aim then was
to bounce the State into giving a bigger
grant and to have 20 acres at Parkville ear-
marked for the future. The Treasury will
not wholly maintain the new institution, but.
will supply a substantial subsidy; the public
will be tapped for the balance.
Sydney daily paper item :
The general opinion in political circles is that
the Royal Commission’s findings on the proposed
creation of new States will .kill any further agitation
for the constitution of new States.
There is something amusing about the idea
that the finding of a little mostly-amateur
< 'ourt, presided over by a city-bred Judge
with a local jurisdiction up to £4OO, or only
£2OO if a land title is involved, will finish
the demand for Home Rule in the north.
Some day a plumber with a title may be
brought from England to report on the
proposed bath-tap in Canberra Government
House, and if he decides against it as pie-
mature. goodness knows what will happen.
In the great business of promising to give
the globe to every applicant, N.S.W. Labor-
leader Lang has a brilliant colleague in ex-
Premier Dooley, the man who described his
party bosses as “uncouth crooks.’’ He was
thus reported at Lithgow :
The Labor party intended to open industrial banks
so that any combination of men could acquire a busi-
ness. a factory, a coal-mine and such like, and thus
secure full results of their labors.
On the day the good news was published
half a dozen “combinations” were formed in
Sydney Domain, and some in other parks,
all prepared to call early at the Industrial
Bank, and collect the necessary capital to
go into business. Only one of them con-
templated coal-mining, but there was a rush
on “such-like.”
Thus the International Labor Bureau, a
painstaking body which collects informa-
tion about the world’s workers for the League
of Nations
Owing to the warm climate and the ease with
which food may be obtained, by hunting or fishing,
for example, strikes do not impose the same hard-
ships upon strikers fin Australia) as in other
countries.
This of course refers to the recent water-
siders’ strike in Sydney, which collapsed
when the boomerangs and womerahs in the
vicinity of the Argyle Cut had been shot out.
Judge Edwards put in a busy day at
Sydney Quarter Sessions on May 8 when
he sentenced 15 persons, of whom 12 were
“laborers” and three tradesmen. Which sug-
gests that there are too many “laborers,”
and that “laboring” makes for very poor
citizenship.
MUNICIPAL DIGNITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Sydney Labor aldermen carried a motion granting
eight months’ leave of absence on full salary and an
allowance of £l5OO to Chief-Inspector Yogwell,
who will attend the Congress of the Royal Sanitary
Institute at Edinburgh. Alderman Holdsworth pointed
out that an allowance of £4 a day was necessary to
enable the officer to stay at the best hotels in
Britain and the Continent and worthily uphold the
dignity of the Sydney City Council.”
A puzzling thing, you may agree,
Our City Council’s dignity.
A plant that wind and storm defies
Beneath its rugged native skies,
But must be screened in lands afar
Like costly hot-house orchids are.
It suffered not, you are aware—
Or not, at least, beyond repair—
When Royal Commissions poked about
And dragged unpleasant details out
Regarding “cuts” and “coins” and things
And surreptitious offerings
Discreetly tendered apropos
Of where a petrol pump should go.
No damage irretrievable,
As far as could be learned, befell
The civic scutcheon —’twas not
Accounted for a damning blot —
When one prospective Whittington
Owned that his humble crust wrts won,
Or most of it, by backing horses
For patrons on suburban courses.
And did it hurt the City’s dig.,
The frank admission? Not a fig.'
Yet if, where Scots or Britons live,
A Council representative
JI is carcase in a pub should rest
That doesn’t rank as very best,
If he should travel, an he durst,
By any class excepting first,
Or tip a porter niggardly,
Or take two looks at a bawbee,
‘Twould be a black and bitter shame,
A stigma on our City’s name!
A most imposing thing, to me,
Our City' Council’s dignity.

laden to Plimsoll mark with kliaki vigorous j

almost ready to sail when a ter nun
damsel and her aggressive mother pushed up
the gangway. Simultaneously a young sol-
dier slipped down from the bulwarks with a
curse and disappeared. He was broiight to
light shortly in the bowels o.The .ship, but
made a great fight to evade the holy bonds
of matrimony. However, his objections were

prepared to carry out all

and also submit to the reli-
gious ceremony at the earli-
est opportunity, they may
live as man and wife with-
out sin until such opportu-
nity arrives. This, does not
say that under ordinary cir-
cumstances a clergyman can
“marry himself,” and has
nothing to do with that
question. The matter is
dealt with in both aspects
by the late Charles Reade in
his novel “Foul Play.” The

fies the conditions I have set out above.

as far as Melbourne. The man was arrested

apparently lost her way in the intricacy ot
passages at the Sydney Supreme Court

I can find the Judge in adultery?”

“Oliver Twist’s” tale to make us blush
Five years ago a Sydney policeman one winter’s
night found a little boy wandering in the streets.
He was barely 13, and what a pitiful object
he was! Dirty and half-starved, he was a
mass of ghastly scars from head to foot. His dis-
torted little body had been burned. How he came
by such injuries he could not tell. Poor boy! he
was sub-normal —one of those unfortunates, who suffei
for the'sins of others. There were other marks on
his body to show that he had been brutally ill-used.
From all appearances he had been chained up for
long periods, at times by the arms and at other times
by “the legs. As I looked into his poor, haunted
little face I understood what the words “human
brutes” really mean.
He was charged (the irony of it!) with being
a neglected child, and the State adopted the poor
little waif. He was sent to the State Home at
Mittagong, where he was put with other orphans
among boys good, bad and indifferent. For it is
here that the juvenile delinquents under 14 years
from all over the State are housed.
After spending some time at Mittagong it was
decided to “board” the boy out to a. lady in
Sydney. But when his new-found guardian saw
the pitiful object that was to be her charge, her
heart misgave her, and after having him examined
by a doctor she returned him to the Child Welfare
Department, which sent him to the Farm Home,
Gosford. This is the institution where offenders
between the ages of 14 and 18 are confined. Although
he had never committed any offence, this was to be
his home until he attained the age of 18! Not
a very happy choice for one so afflicted.
In due .course he reached the age of 18, at which
the State considers its wards are sufficiently educated
and trained to go out into the world to battle for
themselves. He had no education; he could not
read or write. He had no trade or occupation,
never having been taught one. And he had not one
reputable friend or companion—the system prevented
that. All his companions were undesirable —the
environment saw to that.
But the State, in a generous moment, decided ro
do something special for its foster-son. Although
he was now over 18, and, therefore, had no claim
on its benevolence, yet it decided to “place” this
orphan once more. This time it did it most effec-
tively, “placing” him in the Liverpool Asylum—in
other words, the Poor House. What this un-
fortunate orphan’s next misfortune will be Heaven
only knows. His cup of bitterness seems full to
overflowing.

“X.N.0.”: Quaint amendments of orders,
etc., are not unknown in the Navy either
(B. 14/5/’25). Not many years ago a
battleship called at Malta on her way home
from China to England to pay off, the officers
with a generous stock of clothes awaiting laun-
dry treatment. They were strangers to
Malta, so the commander of the Glory ap-
pealed for information by signal to the Bul-
wark, then the Mediterranean flagship. The
message, as sent, read thus: “Commander
Glory to Commander Bulwark. —Can you
recommend a good woman in Malta?” After
despatch the signalman realised his mistake,
and hurriedly made a correction thus: “In
last message please insert ‘washer’ between
‘good’ and ‘woman.’ ”

“Akran”: Our batt. held the same line
of trench at Strazeele for months, and at
Hebuterne we put in a whole 20 days in the
front line. When a spell was on they’d send
us back for a few miles. One morning a
company relieved us. We knew them all.
for we had passed and re-passed each other
about a score of times. “Take care of the
beans we planted in front of the trench,

force. “Struth,” roared back another pessi-
mist, “we’ve got some blanky orange-pips
we’re goin’ to put in.”

IN BABYLON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The American expedition which is excavating at
Kish, in Mesopotamia, reports the finding of the
oldest fish-hook ever discovered, which shows that
the Babylonians used hooks and bait 5000 years
ago in the female burial-mounds, the finds in-
clude copper vanity-cases, containing manicure-sets,
also paint-dishes and -brushes for coloring the lips.
They were adepts, e’en then,
And not only the men
Where hooks that are baited are dangled;
By Tigris’s bank
They ate and they drank,
They lived and they loved and they angled.
They were just such as we
In 3000 b.c.
Or whatever the accurate date is
When the Waltons of Kish
Threw lines for the fish
That lurk in the turbid Euphrates,
And the opposite sex,
Their prey to annex
Cosmetics would artfully dabble on
The cheek and the lip,
Or powder the tip
Of the nose that made havoc in Babylon.
Was it sturgeon they played
Where the willow-rods swayed?
Did they haul up the tunny in batches ?
Did they lie —same as you
Are accustomed to do—
Concerning the weight of their catches ?
Did they groan as they spoke
Of the monster that broke
Away at the weir or the lasher ?
Devil doubt it! You’ll find
Anglers much of a kind
Though their god be Jehovah or Asshur.
And the modern-day bint,
Who her dial will tint —
A trait for shocked wowsers to gabble on—
’Tis as well she should know
Fifty centuries ago
They had vanity-cases in Babylon.
They landed their fish, •
I’ll bet you, at Kish —
All sorts —and I find myself wishing
For something to show
We really know
Any more than they did about fishing.
They had reels, one opines,
Gut bottoms, silk lines
And possibly flybooks and spinners;
And the yarns that they told,
Those fishers of old,
Of their prowess, I reckon, were winners.
Far distant the day
’Tis like, you will say,
When they’d only stone tablets to scrabble on.
All the same, you aren’t so
Progressive, you know,
You Australian anglers for bass and for beaux -
They had fish-hooks and lipsticks in Babylon.

“Harold Hardupp”: Melbourne still stops
the running of its trams on Sunday morn-
ings ; but Sunday golf and Sunday tennis
are becoming more and more popular. In
the tangle Bumbledom is naturally puzzled
about what to do with the people who want
to play tennis on the municipal courts, or
football in the parks. A quaint sort of
compromise was reached by the Essendon
Council when it decided that games may be
played on the parks as long as they are not
organised games. Football, it seems, is not
an organised game as long as football uni-
forms and goal-posts are not used. In short,
the sanctity of the Sabbath will not be violated
in Essendon as long as the winter game is
played in long pants and a couple of rusty tins
are used instead of wooden uprights. Whether
it is allowable to tuck the legs of the pants
inside the socks is a problem yet to be
threshed out.

“Old Wig”: That the damage claimed
in tort—that is, where an injury or
wrong is done to a person—must not be
too remote is a settled principle in law r .
There is a leading case where the manager
of a theatre had his play for the
night hopelessly spoiled by the enforced
absence of the leading gent. The actor was
in bed on account of a severe thrashing he
had received during the day. It was im-
possible for him to make love to the leading
WORKMEN’S COMPENSATION.
“The cheek of it! She's claiming a thousand pounds from the Railways for an in-
jured thumb.”
“Well, it’s worth it—if it’s the one she keeps her husband under with.”
lady in the evening. The Court held that
the manager couldn’t get anything out of
the assailant—the damage was too remote,
A recent English case on the point is in-
teresting. A man and his wife went shop-
ping. Under any circumstances the act
would postulate misfortune to the man, but
in this instance it came in a special way.
His wife was looking at some articles, pro-
bably hats, when the skylight over the shop
fell in and hit her husband. Naturally, this
frightened the wife, and in trying to pull
her hubby out of danger she sprained herself,
The man promptly brought an action for
damages on account of his own wounds and
the same redress was claimed on account
of the wife. The question then arose as to
whether the sprain to the better-half was
not “too remote.” The defendant claimed
that it was, though he frankly admitted
negligence. The sprain, he contended, was
no part of his misdoing. The wife, by her
own voluntary act, had done something she
ought not to have done, and there were no
damages in her. The Court held, with the
wisdom of Solomon, that, whilst there was
no legal duty on the wife to try to save her
husband, still there might well be a moral
obligation, causing her instinctively to make
an attempt to protect him against defend-
ant's negligence. The Courts grow more
human every day.

“T.P.”: The sequel to the yarn of the in-
dignant mother who bashed a Victorian head-
master (B. 9/4/’25) is worth telling, and
should be of special interest to teachers who
have not paid the membership fee of 20s.
to‘their Union Defence Fund. The assaulted
dominie was a full-blown member, so the
union promptly took up the matter. A
lawyer was engaged, and the muscular ter-
magant was brought to court. After being
dressed down by an indignant P.M., she paid
a thumping fine and costs, and sobfully pro-
mised to refrain from such drastic methods
of protest for the future. Teachers are pour-
ing their subs, in now, for, like measles, this
“wallopin’ the teacher wot smacked my Bill”
is catching. “It’s an ill wind that blows
nobody any good,” says secretary Hart.

“Schnorrer”: Australian Jewry, having
forgotten some of its ancestral lore, remained
cold last month while the Chosen in Europe
were holding a special celebration to com-
memorate the sun and moon being in the
same position as at the Creation. For ordi-
nary purposes the Jewish calendar is a lunar
one, which makes a complete circle of adjust-
ment in 19 years; but there is also a “major
cycle,” based on the calculation of a re-
markably accurate Rabbi of very ancient
times; in this cycle the complete adjustment
of the solar universe takes place every 28
years, and April 8 started the 204th cycle
of 28 years since Adam. Traditionally, the
sun and moon were placed in their present
relation to the earth on a Wednesday; and
this particular Wednesday in every 28 years,
when the sun and moon are back in their
original places, is considered by East Euro-
pean Jews worthy of special notice. A reli-
gious ceremony known as “The sanctification
of the sun” is the star item in the pro-
gramme.
* * * *
“Wonkonguru”: My experience of Hin-
doos, or, rather, Brahmins, is that they will
swear truthfully on any water that comes
from a river or the sea (B. 12/3/’25). They
claim that Gunga is the mother of waters,
and as she empties into the sea transfers
her virtue thereto. I once helped a Sikh
to burn a compatriot of his who had perished
(we cremated him in a tinned-salmon case,
by the way) ; the only thing that worried
him was my refusal to let him throw the
ashes into the bore stream from which I
got my drinking supply. As for Mohamme-
dans, they do not take the slightest notice
of an oath sworn on a Koran printed by the
infidel: it is a defiled copy, and therefore
of no virtue. I have often listened to a
mob fighting their law-battles over again
around the camp-fire and listened to their
chuckles as they have, described their
perjuries. If a genuine copy of the Koran
could have been procured in court and given
to the witness by another of his own faith
(the mere fact of its being handled by a
Christian defiles it), the evidence would have
been different. Only the other day an Afghan
moolah and I were discussing our respective
religions, and we got into an argument as
to which of his sons Abraham had offered
as a sacrifice. He called to one of his men
to bring the Koran to prove that I was
wrong. The sacred book was wrapped in
a piece of silk; this was in turn wrapped
in a soft leather bag, beautifully worked;
the leather bag was then wrapped in another
piece of silk, and the whole lot enclosed in a
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
“I’ll give you every penny I have in the world.”
“Oh, yes, I know —and then expect me to keep you.”
serviceable leather bag. The package was
beautifully clean, though it had been carried
on the packsaddle of a camel for three
months. I wanted to handle it, but the old
moolah politely but firmly refused to let me.
By the way, the Koran has it that it was
Ishmael who was offered up to the sacrifice
by Abraham.

“Albatross”: Is there anything in palmis-
try? When I was 23, and second mate of
an Australian coasting steamer, I had a dol-
lar’s worth of it in Queen Victoria Markets,
Sydney, from a lady who pronounced “You will
meet with a very serious accident between
the ages of 30 and 40. I can see a little
money coming to you about this time —not
much—and the indications are that it will
come to you through the accident.” Thir-
teen years later, while first mate of a West-
ralian Government ship, I was shot on to
the wharf by carrying away of the
anchor gear. Beside minor injuries, I col-
lected a compound fracture of the thigh and
jaw, and spelled in hospital for six months,
and it was another six before I was fit for
duty again. When I claimed compensation
I found the Employers’ Liability Act cut no
ice. because the accident had happened on
a State ship, and the King is not liable as
an employer. I managed to squeeze a paltry
£125 from the Scafidan Labor Government,
but I was out of pocket to the tune of over
£4OO in wages for the 12 months of enforced
idleness. I still find myself wondering if
there is anything in palmistry.
* * * *
“Feng-Shui” : I don’t mind confessing that
I am glad the attempt of the Victorian Gov-
ernment to interfere with the liberties of
Chinese herbalists is being strenuously re-
sisted by large numbers of people who claim
to have been benefited by their ministrations.
Since a “boy” employed by me, whom a
European doctor wanted to cut up in the
usual way for appendicitis, was completely
restored to health by the ministrations of a
Chinese doctor, I have revised my opinions
about Fat Sam, hsien sheng. There is usu-
ally a good deal of commonsense behind his
mumbo-jumbo. Although he sometimes pre-
scribes dragons’ blood obtained from the vil-
lage goat for tuberculosis, deer’s horns got
from the local abattoirs for gout, and the
urine of male infants for sore eyes, this is
only to satisfy those of his clients who prefer
mysteries, to humdrum nostrums; usually he
derives his medicines from vegetable sources,
w r hich,. since most of us suffer from protein-
poisoning, doubtless explains his numerous
cures amongst a carnivorous people like the
Australians. • One of his remedies would
save the family doctor a lot of prescription-
writing. It is called the Pharmacopoeia in
One Pill, or something of the sort. A single
dose is sufficient to make any average person
sweat his boots off in ten minutes, after
which he feels weaker but better. I know,
for I have tried it.
“E.G.”: “A.R.C.” (B. 2/4/’25) puts for-
ward interesting theories regarding infantile
paralysis; but his
suggestion that the
cause may lie in
cow’s milk contami-
nated by some in-
jurious plant is dis-
counted by the
facts surrounding
the M.L. epidemic.
The disease broke
out and reached its
utmost severity in
Wellington, a city
served almost, wholly
by a municipal milk
depbt. The milk is
treated by a germ-
destroying process
and is delivered in
scaled bottles at
the doors of rich
and poor alike.
Karori, a suburb
which gets its milk
direct from the
near-by farmer, was
scarcely affected,
while other suburbs
similarly placed
were severely at-
tacked. Ilawera, a
town right in the
middle of dairying
Taranaki, was let
off lightly, while
sheep centres like
Christchurch, Tima-
ru and Dunedin got
a full share of
cases. As for the
suggestion that the
supposititious plant
was conveyed to
the cow in hay,
the disease was at
its height in the
full flush of a good
season for green
feed. No; “A.R.C.”
hasn’t solved the
puzzzle.
“Tarago”: “Scotty,” a noted character in
a Gippsland township, has had a few
crowded weeks. He started by knock-
ing a hole in his spud-digging cheque, and
leaving the pub with a stutter at the knees.
Nobody saw him for a week; then someone
rushed to the police-station with the news*
that he was lying dead near his tent. The
body was brought in and identified, and a
magisterial inquiry found that he had died
from exposure. A few days later some of
the mourners at his funeral were recounting
his virtues over a glass when the late
lamented walked in. To those who waited
for an explanation he indignantly denied
that he was a corpse, and proceeded
to introduce such life into the proceedings
that they attracted the attention of the
policeman who had recently collected his sup-
posed remains. The John gathered him in
again, and landed him before the Beak who
had previously found him to be dead.
“Scotty” paid his resurrection fee in the
form of a fine, but refused emphatically to
add his funeral expenses. Meantime, no-
body seems to be worrying about the sub-
stitute under the sod.
* * * #
“Ragar”: Re accidental meetings (B.
23/4 /’25). A cousin of mine, one of twin
brothers, came to Australia in 1893 from
England. He settled in the country, and
gradually lost all touch with his relations
overseas. His brother settled in Canada.
Neither brother had ever written to the other,
nor knew of his whereabouts. Last year, at
Wembley, they discovered each other lunch-
ing at opposite sides of the same table,
recognition being almost simultaneous. Not
bad after 31 years, though they still re-
sembled each other in a remarkable manner.
* * * *
“Tas”: The alteration of “cooks’ ladies”
to “cooks’ ladles” (B. 14/5/’25) is only one
instance of the meticulous care and unceas-
ing _ vigilance expended by the Australian
military authorities on their army orders.
Here are two more of these solemnly gazetted
amendments taken from an official pro-
nouncement of December last:—
In scale of provisions, before the word “biscuit, ’
insert the word “army.”
Delete “1.320 z. pepper” and substitute “l/320z.
pepper.”
Think what might have happened if we had
been invaded while the army was still liable
to be handed an ounce and a third of pepper
per day instead of one-thirty second part of
an ounce. Happily the brass-hats got tne
correction gazetted in time.
MEN OF LEISURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The latest census discloses that Fitzrov, once
maligned as the gunman’s suburb, is the most leisured
part of Melbourne, being the only district where men
of independent means are above 1 per cent.”
In stately mansions of Toorak our city merchants
dwell,
While bank clerks pay their weekly rent in Kew
or Camberwell.
But men of independent means have leisure to enjoy
The more exciting prospects from the plaza of
Fitzroy.
Carlton can boast a brewery; there’s gasworks out
at North ;
From each St. Kilda bathing-box a bookie issues
forth.
But gallant gunmen take the air, and wave their
little toy—
They like to welcome strangers in the side-streets of
Fitzroy.
They saunter idly to and fro, they neither toil nor
spin,
But well they know what ponies have been meant to
lose or win ;
All gentlemen of leisure who enjoy a good cigar,
And every evening promenade the Fitzroy boulevard.
The gilded gunmen treat with scorn dark suburbs
farther back,
The newly-rich at Middle Park, the toilers of Toorak.
Foctscray has river reaches, and some charms that
never cloy.
But men of leisure much prefer the pavements of
Fitzroy.

This bank hasn’t a branch outside its own
State—-not even in London. And since
Westralia holds but a handful of people, tins
restriction is a handicap. When a bank has
its business widely distributed it can, for
instance, if its deposits are shrinking, call
in a little of its own advances here and a
little there without disturbing that delicate
thing confidence upon which every bank so
much depends. The W.A. Bank would find
such a process difficult; moreover, the very
circumstances that produced the shrinkage
of deposits would almost certainly make_ it
difficult to get in advances without inflicting
hardship and probably losing accounts. Ihus
it comes about that this bank can’t afford to
work on the public’s money to anything like
the same extent as, say, the Bank of N. b.
Wales. A year ago its total liabilities were
£3,709,447, and its own funds were
£1,261,341; in other words, it had less than
£3 of the public’s money for every £1 or its
own in the business. Yet it realised that
for expansion it must look to an increase of
share and premium capital, whereas a bank
differently situated might have thought itself
pretty severely reflected upon by the public if
it could not command at least £6 of outside
money for every £1 of its own.
To provide, then, for expansion, during
the past six months 100,000 £1 shares were
sold to London at 535., of which the bank
got 495. A further 100,000 were ap-
plied for in Australia and allotted at
a premium of 30s. The shares were
taken up on the directors’ expression
of confidence in a 16§ p.c. div., which repre-
sents a return of Qh P-c. p.a. to London
buyers and 6§ p.c. to Australian. lhe
£200,000 already received does not influence
the div. for last half-year, so the 174 P-c.
that was paid cannot be taken as a criterion
for future divs. Of course there will be
more money at work —£495,000. less the ex-
penses—but that will have to earn over 7
p.c. net and other funds will have to main-
tain their present return if the 174 P-c. is to
be continued. The 16§ p.c., however, seems
sure enough; aSJ p.c. return on total funds
will suffice to pay it.
This is an encouraging little comparison :
Exes. p.c. of
March Half, Gross Profits. Expenses. Gross Profits.
1914.. £74,901 £38,744 51.7
1920.. 77,292 46,756 60.5

1924.. 100,179 60,984 60.8
1925.. 110,852 64,585 58.2
But whether it be 16s p.c. or -0
p.c. the figure is misleading: by reason
of the premiums at which nearly all
the shares have been issued, to the
majority of holders even the frequent
20 p.c. represented little _ more than 7 p.c.
Nor have investors practically any hope of
future share-issues at par—the bank is
under an obligation not to make them. A
Federal banking law might change the posi-
tion.

Judged by ordinary standards, the position is
very strong. But, as before indicated, ordi-
nary standards don’t apply. Here is a bank
with funds of its own of over a million and
three-quarters, and with almost another hait-
million coming in during the next month
or two: and there is no reason at all to
suspect now that its funds are not intact
and solid. Yet it has advances of only
£3 396,439. Restriction to a single held is a
cruel handicap—as a couple of banks some-
what similarly placed in Tasmania found out
long ago. They escaped by selling them-
selves to a mainland bank. The W .A. Bank
might find another way.

Frankly that isn’t much of a table. Ordi-
narily, when it is said that a co. lips re-
serves of so and so, it means that it has
its capital, and that much to the good.
In this case, so far from having any reserves
at all, the co. hasn’t got quite all of its
capital of £337,802. For 13 years it has
been issuing policies, and liabilities have
been gradually piling up on them. As
at December 31, 1924, these liabilities,
according to the co.’s actuary, amounted to
£778,302. Really, therefore, the co. still
has a deficit of £l3,B67—the difference be-
tween £778,302 and £764,435. In fact, the
deficit may be a little more than that. This
shows the position better, perhaps:—
Life assurance fund .. .. .. £778,302
Special reserve .. .. ■ • • • 150,000
Reserve for unexpired accident risks.. 11,461
Unappropriated balance .. .. 19,274
£959,037
Less goodwill items .. .. .. 194,602
£764,435.
So a reserve for unexpired accident risks is
included in the funds. Excluding that, and
assuming that the actuary’s calculation of
what the co. owes under its life policies is
right, then the A.P.A. still has £25,328 of
profit to make and put by before its capi-
tal will be intact.
The goodwill items mentioned just now
are as follows: —
Purchase account .. .. .. ..£84,503
Establishment account —Life . . . . 50,000
Ditto—Fire, marine and accident . . 60,099
The A.P.A. ran into a sea of troubles three
years ago, and the founder, Selby P. Wood,
having come back to the bridge again, vari-
ous things were thrown overboard. The fire
and marine department was disposed of to
an English co. on terms which provided for
the payment of 10 p.c. p.a. for five years
on gross premiums from business transferred.
The A.P.A. was relieved immediately of all
liability, and, besides, saved the heavy cost
of the department. As a result of negotia-
tions last year £24,500 was received in full
settlement of this deal. The F., M. and A.
establishment account was thereby reduced
by £23,390; but there remains £60,099 as
a' reminder of an unfortunate adventure in
underwriting. That amount is to be wiped
out of the accounts from profits from the
personal accident department. Which means
that this paper asset is going to be an old
inhabitant before it finally quits the balance-
sheet. Further, the expensive South African
business was sold to the Southern Cross
for £3OOO cash ; and that was a good thing
to be without, too. But the co. has been
an active buyer as well as a seller; hence
the “Purchase account” above mentioned,
which represents the cash paid for the life
and personal accident business of the Co-
operative, plus the actuarial liability on that
co.’s policies and those of the Q. Probate (in
Westralia) and the Australian Probate. Be-
fore the £84,503 was written in, £3750 was
written off out of the year’s profits, equal
to £5OOO p.a. The account will be reduced
year by year from the profits on the busi-
ness taken over. These profits should be
fairly substantial, because almost all the
Co-op.’s “loading” (for exes.) will be saved.
The A.P.A. should be able to increase the
amount to £lO,OOO p.a., but it is probably
too much to expect that it will divest itseli
of all immediate profit from the deal. Ir
addition, during the year the co. acquirer
all but a few shares in the Life Insurance
Co. of Australia (this accounts for most
of the assets item. “Shares in cos.
£235,008”). The “Wild Cat” reviewed the
deals as they were made; all seemed good
enough propositions.
The progress made during the year in the
ordinary way of business —on the life side,
that is—may be summarised :
1923. 1924.
First premiums .. .. £55,769 £70,572
Sum assured 1,606,719 2,067,220
Renewals .. .. .. 206,058 216,732
Income .. .. .. 417,503 448,628
Expenses . • • • • • 205,151 200,032*
Claims.. .. .. .. 70,798 64,065
''lncluding' div. £27,148.
Expenses in 1922 amounted to over 50 p.e.
of income; in 1923, to 41 p.c.; last year
they had fallen to 35 p.c. The movement
is decidedly favorable, and the position will
be quite good when the present rate is clipped
in halves. New business in 1923, on the
assumption that it costs ten times as much
as old, ran away with 178 p.c. of first-year
premiums. Last year the rate was 147
p.c. A fall of 31 points in the new-business
cost is good, too; and here again the position
will be quite satisfactory when the shears
bisect the present figures. It is a large
thing to look forward to; yet it is the mark
that has to be striven for.
Instead of paying a bonus out of the very
fair profit shown by last year's life business
the co. very wisely, in view of the fact that
a bit of capital was still to be made good,
put the surplus into what it calls a “special
actuarial reserve” —really a bonus reserve.
That there was a surplus to add to this
fund is due to the fact that the rate of in-
terest assumed by the actuary is 4 p.c., as
against 3 and 3J p.c. assumed by the older
offices. The A.P.A.’s assumption means that
the fund doesn’t need to be as large as
it would have to be if a lower rate was
assumed; yet, in view of the present and
probable earnings of money, the 4 p.c. is
reasonable enough. On its mean funds the
co. seems last year to have actually earned
£6 7s. p.c.—that is, after deducting interest
and “property expenses.” The assets have
moved like this :
1920. 1923. 1924.
Public securities . . £716,064 £733,812 £649,199
Properties . . . . 139,345 191,489 187,685
Mortgages .. .. 16,665 106,288 300,599
Shares in cos. .. 2,253 235,008
Loans on policies, etc... 4,967 11,775 15,504
Outstanding premiums. . 44,228 36,251 45,359
Book debts, etc. . . 78,399 71,531 59,392
Cash 17,998 11,913 21,252
Other assets .. .. 9,797 16,162 16,136
On December 31 tangible assets aggregated
£1.530,135. Liabilities (excluding premiums
paid in advance and in suspense) amounted
to £399,277 (£252,362 in 1923)— maoney bor-
rowed on mortgage, £59,645; ditto on de-
posit, £245,364; overdraft, etc., £78,266. The
less trustee cos. borrow the better —and
a life office is a trustee co. on a large scale.
Still, so long as a proprietary office doesn’t
borrow in excess of its intact capital, no
great objection can be taken. That some
offices haven’t borrowed has been small re-
commendation. They haven’t borrowed be-
cause they haven’t been alive enough to
really do anything. The A.P.A. is certainly
alive.
The position, then, is that shareholders’
capital (assuming that the “special actuarial
reserve” belongs to them) is again almost
intact; and from this it follows that policy-
holders are very fully protected—they have
all the protection a purely mutual office
which assumes 4 p.c. future interest earn-
ings would offer, and over £300,000 besides.
Their prospects, so far as bonuses are con-
cerned, depend upon the ability of the man-
agement to reduce the expense rate; and
the dividend prospects for shareholders are
governed chiefly by the same factor. Both
will be helped by an accident business whose
profit it is hard to gauge at present, but
which might to give something substantial.
And, of course, future bonuses will be im-
proved by the bonus reserve which, as shown
above, has already climbed to £150,000.

All things considered, Rothwells did very
well to show that profit. During the year
the co.’s big Edward-street freehold was re-
modelled and the factory transferred to less
valuable quarters; several departments were
closed, and the stock cleared. Exes, were
cut down by almost 20 p.c.; gross profits
were £19,964 and exes. £16,656 compared
with £18,094 and £20,704 for the previous
year. In view of the disorganisation and
the fact that the greater part of the building
was not revenue-producing during most of
the term, that result is worth a cheer. Better
still, the co. did not run into debt to make
the changes:—
IQI4 IQ9Q 1 Q 94 IQ9K

Cash, etc. . . 1,868 3,379 1,427 1,067
Thus by reducing stocks and book debts the
co. remodelled the Edward-street premises
at a cost of about £lO,OOO and built on its
other city freehold (that cost between six
and seven thousand) without going more
than another £1679 into debt. But whether
the co. will have the same turnover, and
therefore the same possibilities of profit, with
the reduced stock remains to be seen. Still, it
may make far more by letting the premises
which it formerlyput to poor use. The directors
claim that the offices already let are bring-
ing in £3BOO p.a., and “as the year pro-
gresses and more of the offices are let a
better return may be anticipated.” The
Edward-street property stands in the books
at £31,030; and the £3BOO return from a
mere let-off portion makes it pretty certain
that there is a handy undisclosed reserve
here. Farther, as the total capital is only
£60,000, the co. won't have to do much in
the outfitting way to bring the return to
something decent. More than the merely
decent the shareholders have never got; and
though there was a sweetener in 1921, tin
past four years have averaged only 3| p.c.
—poor going for a 26-year-old concern quar-
tered in the best part of the city.

Rut though a portly 11-| p.c. div. was paid,
it was only made possible by the size of the
reserves. Actually the declared profits are
poor: calculated on total funds (capital and
reserves combined) they were only a shade
over 5i p.c., notwithstanding that the co.
had the use of no less than £780,080 of de-
benture capital at an average cost of 5§ p.c.
One of the reasons for the small return is
found here: —
Cash and investments .. .. £339,241
Merchandise stocks . . .. 219,742
Mortgages, foreclosures, etc. .. 948,137
Wool and produce advances .. 25,167
Sundry debtors .. .. .. 357,952
Premises, plant, etc. .. .. 67,671
Total assets .. .. £1,957,910
Thus the best part of £340.000 is in presum-
ably gilt-edged securities. But, even so, either
the remainder of funds must be earning poor
money or the co. must he stacking a good
deal away to provide for contingencies. The
chances are that it finds it has been giving
more help than it should to people who have
made contracts to buy land at ridiculously
high prices. It is an old offence of these
cos. in Maoriland. Certainly the past year
would show up a bit better but for two
things: £3198 was voted to the superannua-
tion fund (nothing visible had gone that way
for many years), and the M.L. tax-gatherer
opened his mouth much wider than in the
previous year. The great variation in taxes
largely explains the unevenness of profits.
For instance: —
1922 1923. 1924.
Gross profits .. .. £188,125 £155,416 £156.124
Exes, and English taxes 65,803 61,472 62,864

Profit . . . . £21.643 £38,356 £33,809*
Less £3198. voted to Superannuation Fund.
In the long run these M.L. country mortgage
and agency cos. generally come out all right,
chiefly because there is never any great loss
of stock as there is in Australia. But that
very circumstance emboldens them to put
men into properties on terms which would
seem utterly wild in the Commonwealth.

Formed in 1910, it has since paid £31,800
in divs., put by £25,541 and paid £4oS
preliminary exes. The success has been
largely due to the amount of business which
Elder, Smith and Co. was able to transfer
or influence. The value of estates admin-
istered has increased since 1918 by approxi-
mately a half-million each year:
tDU .. £53,502 i 1921 ..£4,078,224
1914 .. 1,463,454 I 1922 .. 4,791,0j6
1918 .. 2,779,039 I 1923 .. 5,206,610
1919 .. 3,217,709 I 1924 .. 5,741,550
1920 . . 3,553,763 | 1925 . . 0,213,625
Like most of the family, Elder s decided that
a large nominal capital would make a nice
decoration, but that a small paid capital
could do the work. Thus of the authorised
half-million only £lOO,OOO was issued to start
with, and only 4s. per share (£20,000) ot
that was called. However, profits were be-
coming uncomfortably large by 1921,_ and
that, plus the co.’s extension of activities to
Broken Hill and Wentworth, which necessi-
tated £20,000 being placed in N.S.W. securi-
ties, resulted in another 100,000 shares being
issued and 4s. called. A like issue was made
last year. All that, of course, adds to the
clients’ security; for though the new share-
holders brought in only £40,000 in cash, they
are liable for another £160,000. But a staff
trained to its business is not likely to no
anything which would require a call. Most
of the co.’s own funds are in gilt-edged secu-
rities ; £22,000 more than paid capital is
averaging 54 p.c. p.a., and interest pays the
dividend—wliich makes the thing look very
'attractive.

An Adelaide crowd in control of Bright
Hope claims to have got hold of a promising
show in new ground near Meekatharra.
What they really have is a claim which
Edna May Central tried and abandoned.
Prospectors got a few sensational crushings
from a small patch and then stood aside
while the Central looked in vain for more.
The show belongs to a class of rich pockets
occasionally met with in the West, usually
short-lived, and on which no co. should waste
money.
.* * * *
Brown’s Reward (W.A.) is urging its
more or less disheartened shareholders to
pay another 3d. call. The co. has tried sev-
eral so-called good things in the past, but
all turned out badly, and the one now being
toyed with at Field’s Find isn’t likely to
be any different. Anyway, as The Bulle-
tin emphasised some time ago, Brown’s Re-
ward is too weakly-financed to prove a mine
if it got hold of one. Like a lot of other
hand-to-mouth ventures operating in the
West, it ought to either call in sufficient
capital or give up.
The grave of the old Mainland Consols,
near Cue (W.A.). has been opened, and pre-
parations are being made to awaken the
dead. Prior to 1923 about £lOO.OOO was
won. mostly from rich pockets and patches
in shallow ground. Then returns dwindled,
and finally operations ceased. Present own-
ers are hazarding on something good being
got in deeper ground. •
“Nemesis”: Royal Commissioner Kingley
Thomas backs The Bulletin’s opinion that
the basic trouble at Kalgoorlie is inefficiency.
Speaking at Coolgardie the other day, he
declared that the Golden Mile plants be-
longed to the nineteenth century, and that to
make a profit on ore of lower grade than
that now being treated was mainly a
matter of organisation and more Up-to-date
mining and treatment methods. Thomas’s
report, which is being awaited with some
trepidation by the Westralian mining cos.,
should be illuminating, and perhaps prove
a bigger help to the gold-mining industry
than the pound-an-ounce cash bonus for
which the inefficients and their barrackers
are “clamoring.

There won’t be any need for Tom Birk-
beck to shut down Dorrie Doolette’s Kanow-
na Red Hill (W.A.). It fell rapidly trom
ounce to sdwt. stone, a collapse that pulled
Birkbeck out of snug Collins House Quarters
to Perth. Now the winze at No. 4 shaft, sunk
on the big fault plane, has dropped upon an
old-fashioned Kanowna 3oz. patch, and there
is joy among the sporty Doolette coterie.
What has to be proved is whether the old
show can stand up to the pick for any length
of time.

All that Mararoa got from its two drills
at Wiluna (W.A.) was the core of a big
greenstone lode carrying a seam of sul-
phide ore which averages 465. a ton. Small
wonder that manager Mathers isn’t happy
over the assays and that the leases are under
exemption. A better show is being made by
work at Reedy’s, alias Emu North. There
the crosscut at 185 ft.. just below water level,
averaged 40s. a ton for a width of 6ft. In
the north drive of the mine sft. of 2oz. stuff
is in the face. That is a far more solid
value than the stone earlier met in the work-
ing. South, the best assays came from bore-
holes put into the ouartz standing to the
east of the drive. Values ease off as the
face goes ahead. The co. has been going
slow underground until it could get perma-
nent water from Sorenson’s shaft. A trial
crushing from the Emu lease gave poor
stamper results, the gold flowing off in the
tailings, A sliming process will have to be
adopted. Reserves are 16,500 tons of proved
48s. ore in the North mine and 2400 tons
of probable, while the Emu estimate runs out
at 3000 tons of probable worth 30s. a ton.
In recommending a railway to Mt. Isa
as imperative, Chief Geologist Dunstan
placed figures before the Queensland Public
Works Commission that bore out Ernest
Bails’s tonnage estimates down to 100 ft. Dun-
stan stated that there were so far 4,300,000
tons of ore available to a depth of 200 ft.
on four areas alone, of a gross value of
£16,000,000. This value was arrived at on
the basis of an average value of 755. Id. per
ton; but this is qualified by the statement
that it is a very low estimate, and takes no
account of zinc values in the ore. Dunstan’s
margin of safety—presumably he has taken
one—seems amazingly large, for his estimate
for the Black Star, which supplies over 70
p.c. of the tonnage, is about 20s. per ton
lower than Bails gave out for the Star to
100 ft. This was largely in leached ore, and
the assays for second hundred have been
consistently higher. Bails’s assays work out
at 81s. for the first 100 ft. and about 100 s.
for the second 100 ft.; and the Ibus bore
gives 141 s. for the third 100 ft. However,
if Dunstan cut down the figures he went with
enthusiasm for the railway. He thought
that the mining of these deposits would last
at least a century. The estimates for the
Black Star and Ibus were £11,370,000,
Black Rock £3,000,000, Rio Grande
£1,500,000, Mt. Isa (lode) £200,000.
Incidentally, he informed the Commission
that water supply was a problem not
yet solved. That, however, is not causing
much uneasiness, for if Isa will not hold
water, good storage reservoirs can be con-
structed within five miles of the field and
the water gravitated to the mines.
* * * *
The assays from the core of the Mt. Isa
Prop.’s No. 1 bore show for the first time a
great preponderance of zinc, although the
metal is present in the deeper workings
throughout the field. This No. 1 bore lias
tested the greater portion of the Black Star
lode between the approximate vertical depths
of 200 ft and 300ft.— i.e., entirely within the
sulphide zone. Between these depths there
is a true thickness of 80ft. of ore —possibly
more, as the core above 200 ft. was lost. This
measurement cannot therefore be taken
to mean that the 100 ft. lode in the Black
Star has diminished by 20ft. in the next
200 ft. down. In addition to this there is a
lode 10ft. thick between 125 ft. and 135 ft.
(vertical depth) which averages £5 10s. per
ton in value (lead 14 p.c., silver lOoz.). As
to the main lode, the 80ft. thickness ranges
on assays values from 8 p.c. to 21 p.c. zinc,
6 p.c. to 12 p.c. lead and 2oz. to lloz. silver.
The averages are 13.44 zinc, 7.9 lead and
5.80 z. silver. Taking lead and zinc at £3O
a ton, this gives a gross average value for the
SOft. of £7 Is. per ton —figures which, it
maintained, will put Broken Hill present
values well in the shade. It seems inevitable
on these figures that the big co. will event-
ually take over the smaller; according to
rumors, this may not be long delayed. The
fact that Prop.’s paper is holding its own
above par is to be attributed to this rather
than to the good results obtained in the
bore. The Out on Her Own has come
again into the limelight, and development
work at the 200 ft. level has recently proved
a width of 16ft. of payable ore. No. 2 bore
is well on its way into the Star lode at a
greater depth than the No. 1.
* * * *
Glen Aplin, in the centre of the Stanthorpe
tinfield (Q.), was in the tin boom 40 years
ago. To-day, when the field is quiescent,
comes the announcement that there is some-
thing like a clear million sterling worth of
tin along a section of the Severn waiting to
be won. At any rate. Edgar Hall, of Silver-
spur, and Jack Sailings, of New England,
after making boring tests, are said to vouch
for that amount in the alluvials for six and
a half miles along the Severn near Glen
Aolin. It looks like being the biggest ven-
ture launched on the field for over a decade.
Electricity is the suggested motive power for
pumping and sluicing, and the co. has set
itself a stiff job to try to keep sluicing costs
down to 4d. a yard. This page doesn't
think that Stanthorpe tin is worked out, but
it is mildly surprised to learn that there is
such an area of tin-bearing alluvial along
the much-prospected Severn.
* * * *
Billy Hughes (N.Q.) cut a heavy flow of
water at 85 feet, which preludes further
shaft sinking till a steam winding-plant is
erected. The manager enthuses over the
values, and states that the mineralised ore
at 85ft. concentrates 330 z. to the ton —this
after a succession of values from 7oz. to
220 z., at shallower levels. When a level is
driven at 85ft. he anticipates “sensational
values.” Yet on Cairns Stock Exchange paid
ss. shares are on offer at 3s.
Ophir, Daylesford (Vic.), measured by H.
S. Whitelaw. of the Mines staff, responds
none too badly. In early days it turned out
soz. stuff to water level. Of course none of
that was in sight when the moderns got
into the stopes. But it was a big drop for
them to come down to 6dwt. And most of
the spurs which yielded even that result
won't take long to exhaust. Hence White-
law’s survey. The claim lies in the old
Cornish run of slates. The trick is to pick
up the carbonaceous slates of the line, where
intersected by the vertical faults of the field.
That means solid prospecting and Whitelaw’s
advice is to go ahead with sinking. He
also wants the Ophir track tested at 200 ft.,
as it is in likely looking country.
* * * *
Mt. Bischoff Extended is as carefully
tended as a liot-house plant. Calls started at
l»d., but now are 3d., and so loyal is the
crowd behind the show that only a fraction
is unpaid. Money has been needed to put
up electrical plane with the idea of reducing
costs. John Ditchburn now also controls
the Wheal block of the old Bischoff, and
drives have been run into it off the Extended’s
No. 4 level, from which two stopes are being
operated. It will be a soft job to connect
up other workings. Consequently the run of
ore to the mill should be easily added to.
As the shoots of ore are narrow, the acquisi-
tion of the Wheal block is a feather in
Ditcliburn’s cap. In the Extended the ore
at the bottom level is of good grade as work
goes on overhead. To the south the shoot in
the face is narrow and poor.

Lucknow Pups (N.S.W.) considers that
No. 4 vein is still proving its hanging-wall
junction with the serpentine. Near the face,
and behind the iron pyrites lode, two arseni-
cal pyrites samples assayed 4oz. and 2oz.
respectively.
The fire in the Sulphide Corporation’s
B. LI. Central mine is still causing trouble
and expense, but improvement is steady.
Crosscuts are being reopened and stopes re-
paired on the 400-, 500- and OGO-feet levels,
but when breaking will recommence is not
yet known. Gas is still being met. Gardi-
ner signs as Broken Hill superintendent
these days.
Borneo Oil Options Co. has had another
roll-up in Perth. Strike conditions pre-
vented the gathering being held in a pub, as
arranged, so the proceedings opened on the
footpath and were continued in chairman
Crawcour’s office across the street. Share-
holders were told (1) that, provided a
royalty was paid on every ton of oil pro-
duced, the vendors were willing to give an
extension of the option; (2) that the
co.. at the request of its own geo-
logist, intended to have the results obtained
to date checked by an independent man; (3)
that the issue in Melbourne of 5000 reserve
shares at £5 apiece was assured. Somethin"
was also said about the existence of coal
suitable for “railway, shipping and manu-
facturing requirements” on the co.’s conces-
sions and of the great value of this side-line.
Thabawleik, the Burmese tin show, mostly
run from Melbourne, has an accumulation of
“ifs” and “buts” for presentation to share-
holders at Taiping on May 23. The dredge
contractors are behind their schedule, but
“are doing everything possible” to complete
delivery of remaining parts before the rainy
season. The road and bridges connecting
the head of navigation on the Tenasserim
River with the mine are “believed to be
strong enough” to withstand the floods that
are soon due, "but cost (£19.000) has ex-
ceeded the estimate.” Of the total, “£6OOO is
expected to be contributed” by the Burmese
Government. Efforts are being made to have
the pontoon afloat before the heavy rains
commence, "but the extent to which the work
will be hampered by the first two months of
the rainy season is not known.” In January
33 bores were put down just in front of
the dredge site, and these revealed 21b. oxide
to the yard, as against 141 b. in the original
bores, with a similar average depth of about
17ft. But this good news is neutralised by
what follows. The dredge erection pit to a
depth of 12ft. has exposed much stiffer
ground than that in most of the better-known
dredging areas of the F.M.S. "This may have
the effect of reducing the digging capacity of
the dredge, but there should be a sufficient
margin of profit even with low yardages.
The aim will bo to effect good recoveries at
the expense of large' yardages, until the
special peculiarities of the ground are fully
understood.” And a final sting: “Owing
to the large sum by which the estimated cost
of road and bridges has been exceeded, and
amended estimates of dredge erection and
buildings, the cash at the co. s disposal will
be exhausted before production is reached.
No difficulty will be experienced in making
the necessary financial arrangements.”

Asam Kumbang (F.M.S.) dug 1,433.000
cubic yards for the year, recovering 6224
tons tin oxide, which averaged .971 b. to the
yard as against .74 shown on the boring
chart. The dredge struck a couple of rich
patches. A revenue of £87,260 gave net
profit of £53.977, working costs being kept
down to 3.9 d. per yard. Divs. of 10s. a
share on 100.000 shares took £oo,ooo, and
left £3294 over.
Austral Malay increased its capital from
£20,000 to £lOO,OOO during tlie financial year
by a bonus issue of 80,000 20s. shares, and
paid 12 p.c. in divs. on the inflated capital..
Its prospectors examined some alluvial gold
areas in Upper Burma, but results were in-
conclusive, accessibility being the chief bar.
The co., sticking to its last, had better luck
with a large tin-area, 11 miles from
Kuala Lumpur, and is floating a co.
named Puchong T. D., Ltd., to work 30
million yards 60ft. deep, averaging o.olb. to
the yard. During the year the co. spent.
£ll,OOO on prospecting.

Sir John Laurence Baird, who takes the
vice-regal purple in succession to Lord
Forster, has crowded much experience into
his 51 years. The heir to a Scottish baron-
etcy created 28 years ago to reward his father
for services rendered in Egypt, he was a raw
recruit to diplomacy in Vienna at 22. and after
serving in embassies and on delicate missions
in the field in Abyssinia, Egypt, British E.
Africa and Buenos Ayres, he returned to
England to enter Parliament as Conserva-
tive member for Rugby in 1910. During
the war he donned khaki as an officer in
the Intelligence Corps, and earned a mention
in despatches and a D.S.O. Returning to
politics in 1916, he filled his biggest role as
Minister of Transport, a position he held
until the interlude of Labor rule in 1924.
He married, in 1905, Lady Ethel Sydney
lOith-Falconor. elder daughter of the Earl
of Kintore. There are two sons and three
daughters to cheer them through the wilder-
ness of bazaars and mothers’ meetings that
looms in front of them.

Dead at Cranbournc (A'ie.). aged 75.
W. .1. 11. Carr Boyd, whose tall figure and
sociable personality had made him well
known in many parts of Australia; from the
’eighties until ten years back it was AA’.A.
that saw the most of him. In his younger
days and earlier manhood lie did some
useful if not notable exploring work: he
was one of the first in the Kimberley coun-
try, and in '94 he arrived at Murchison
from the other side of the continent with
all the glamor attachable to the feat in
those days. But for the last quarter of a
century lie was content to live on such laurels
as lie had acquired—which included member-
ship of tln> Savage Club (London) and let-
ters of thanks from celebrities like Glad-
stone and Joseph Chamberlain for putting
their names in not very obtrusive fashion on
the map of Australia —and most of his dashes
into the bush were made on paper. Also,
lie was able to cultivate to the full a gift
for reminiscence—and lively romance. A few
years back the old battler in the faded khaki
coat, paid a visit to the United States and
found Yankee editors quite ready to take
his most, fantastic stories seriously. A
Tasmanian by birth. Carr Boyd did a good
deal of writing for The Bulletin under the
pen-name of “Potjostler” when the world
was younger. Through all his ups and
downs he kept an invincible optimism, and
there was a warm and kindly heart under
his idiosyncrasies.
N.S.W. Governor de Chair was among
those who felt a bit queer when they read
that Tom Linn, the pioneer of civil avia-
tion in the west of N. S. Wales, had crashed
at the Orange Show and been burned to death
along with a lady passenger. Refused a
pilot’s license on account of a weak heart,
Linn still persisted in flying, and it was
with him that tin' Viking made a flight at
the Cootamundra Show.
Although officially only 45 are counted,
tin' first agricultural show on the Ilawkes-
bury River (N.S.W.) was held 90 years

north-western X. S. Wales as “The Diggers'

railway station at Narrabri to cheer the
heart of every Billjim with a “God speed"

fortable circumstances, she reduced herself
to penury by her generosity. At the laying
of the foundation-stone of the Soldiers'

ture costing nearly £20,000 —Mrs. Campbell
sent the last of her jewellery to be raffled.
She was a grand old lady, and the Diggers

years.
Dean J. L. Hegarty. one of Vic.'s oldest
priests, has gone aloft. He first came to
earth within hearing of the bells o' Shau-
don. and was fresh from ordination when he
landed in Melbourne in November. '7l.
After being broken in as a curate at St.
Francis's, from 1879 to 1887 he bad a hard
and adventurous time in Gippsland. where
he was the soggartli aroon in a far-flung
parish. The people were probably even more
deeply disappointed than he when ho was
passed over in favor of Dr. Corbett for the
bishopric of Sale on its establishment
3,8 years ago. After a period at St. Hilda,
he became Dean of Kyneton in 1895. in
succession to the late Dean Gcoghegan, and
there he met people after his own heart. He
sojourned among them for 25 years, and
then, because he was wanted as a counsellor
close to St. Pat.'s. he was given charge of
St. George's parish. Carlton.
"Moc": Touching Detzner. the German
captain who hid himself in the New
Guinea bush during the four years of
the war iB. 14/5/’25). Several efforts were
made to catch the refugee, but they were all
unsuccessful. As soon as a party had been
got ready at Morobe the native spies would
report it to the German, and the latter would
retreat into the mountains, where he might
have been safe from discovery* for years.
Wilfred Nicholson, who then did the bush-
patrols at Morobe. tried half a dozen times
to reach the village- which was giving Deta-
il or shelter and to take him unawares, but
the German always knew within an hour or
two of Nicholsort’s setting out. David
Waugh, a later D.O. at Morobe, also took a
hand, but with no better luck, although once
he missed his quarry’ by only half an hour.
The day after the Armistice Detenor came
into Morobe and surrendered, demanding and
obtaining all the privileges of an officer-
prisoner. When he was sent, to Sydney by
the Melusia in January, 1918. I shared his
cabin for part of the voyage. He
told me much about his life in the village,
which was not so rough as might be thought,
but he was uncommunicative as to the chan-
nels by which he had received food, comforts
and news. Most of his time was spent in
studying native customs, which study has
since earned him some reputation in Europe
as an ethnologist.

“Y. Tara" : Of the last four Premiers of
M.L. Farmer Massey was the third to die
in harness, and the fifth back. Harry Atkin-
son (“The Major”), was scarcely a live man
in the last few weeks of his administration.
This high mortality rate is not a text for one
of those smug dissertations on the killing
strain of Ministerial politics, for Ballance
had an internal complaint of such malig-
nance that the perilous operation under which
he died was inescapable: Seddon and Atkin-
son worked hard enough to kill much younger
men. and Massey was just on 70 years old.
As compensation for whatever risks it car-
ries. office tarries long with the present-day
Premier in M.L. If was not always so. Tu
1884 there were four Ministries—-the Atkin-
son. the Yogel. the Atkinson again and the
Stout-Yogel—in about as many weeks. And
away back there was the “Clean Shirt Min-
istry.” so called because the head thereof
was said to have complained that a ruth-
less majority “only allowed him time to put
on a clean shirt and go and announce his
appointment to his Excellency" before firing
him out of office.
Canon Frewin must have felt a bit un-
comfortable at the laying of the foundation-
stone of the new Masonic Temple in Adel-
aide. Assisting at the rite, he had to pour
wine on the stone and recite the words: “T
pour out wine on this stone as an emblem
of joy and gladness.” Now the Canon is
a great chief among the “dry" brigade in
8. Aus.. and people are asking if the Senior
Warden used the “dinkum oil" to christen
the stone or whether he got a jug of cold
tea for the occasion.
When Murray Clapham. general manager of
Ans ; Mortgage and Estates. Ltd., died of pneu-
monia in his mid-forties, the career of a
brilliant man was cut short. Clapham
arrived in Australia almost as a fugitive
from justice. An Englishman by birth, lie
had been employed superintending Chinese
labor on the Rand, where, in a squabble un-
derground. he shot a coolie in self-defence.
The coolie died, and there being at. that
time some agitation concerning the general
treatment of the Chinese, Clapham was given
the tip to vanish until the fuss subsided. He
wasted no time in getting away, and arrived
in Melbourne almost penniless. Not caring
to disclose his whereabouts by sending for
money, he took a job selling toys in a Chapel-
street emporium at 30s. a week. That was
less than 20 years ago. and since then he
had risen to one of the best-paid billets in
the Commonwealth, and he was about to
leave for a world tour when the Reaper got
him.
Cap’ll Herbert Chudleigh. who has just
gone aloft, was a Cornishman who served
before the mast in all the seven seas before
he reached Sydney in ISOS as a skipper in
sail. Eater lie joined the Department of
Navigation, and cojumanded the pilot steamer
Captain Cook. Tn and out of port in that
time he took 17.000 vessels, while in his
coastal days he estimated his passengers
at 50,000. A foundation member of the
League of Ancient Mariners, he was 78
when he hauled down his flag.
Another of the tribe, David Braliam
Lazarus, has devoted himself to the family
habit of picking up the briefs that fall from
the rich man's table; and the youngster last
week conducted his first case at Ballarat,
where he was born. The Lazarus family
supplied Victoria's first woman lawyer—she
is now Mrs. Rosanove—and Vida Lazarus,
her sister and sister to the latest, recruit,
is managing clerk for Mark Lazarus, their
father. Mark married into a legal family,
his wife's three brothers having been pur-
suers of costs, and their father and his father
before him were in the same business. Both
of these fathers were David Braliam; the
elder of them practised in London.
“Bridge Street”: That Wellington pilot
who didn’t know that Dick Seddon was dead
until the arrival of the vessel on which he
left Sydney (B. 14/5/’25) couldn't have
been ashore for a few days. The captain
turned the ship about and returned to Sydney
Harbor when the big man died; and for a
week before the body arrived in Maoriland
the Sydney-Nelson cable was blocked with
messages, mainly from Owen Cox and the
Union Co., arranging in fullest detail for
the reception of the coffin,
Huffed at being cold-shouldered by leading
National Federationists, Dr. Fetherston with-
drew from the contest for the Melbourne
South (Upper House) seat. His chief sup-
porters then induced Murray Jones. Mayor
of South Melbourne, to re-enter the field.
What probably disconcerted the doctor was
the pace Frank Clarke, President of the
House, was making in the province. He saw
too that he would probably have to go to
the limit of expen-
diture alio w e d
(£400), which is
equal to two years'
pay. and the labor
might, he in vain
because of the luke-
warmness of sup-
posed political
friends. It. Y.
Keane is the Labor
candidate, but he
will have to be
satisfied with a
'good position on
the first count only.
An l ppah Chambah
President has never
been tossed out by
the electors. That
tradition will help
Clarke, who also
li a s tremendous
family and personal
influence behind
him.
FRANK CLARKE,
President, of Vic.
Leg. Council, who

Melbourne South
Province seat.
Leonard Brereton, a native of Armidale
(N.S.W.). was the first Australian to join
the Passionist Order of H.C.’s. He won
high honor in the body, being for seven
years Superior-General at Goulburn
(N.S.W.) and finally at Glen Osmond
(S.A.), where life stopped suddenly at 59.
.Though not Frank Ilyett’s equal as secre-
tary and organiser of the Vie. Bail way Union,
Alee Taylor, summoned aloft the other day.
was a fine type of the unionist executive
officer who believes in exhausting constitu-
tional methods before rattling the sabre. Be-
fore becoming prominent in unionism Taylor
was a force in the A.N.A.. and as chief presi-
dent at the Port Fairy Conference in 1915
gave the association a lead in the matter of
the war that found approval throughout the
State. Wise, who was afterwards P.M.G.
under Hughes, and Peacock, who was Pre-
mier at the time, were among the delegates
who applauded Taylor’s attitude.
The man who revolutionised the diagnosis
of Y.D.. Professor August Yon Wasserman,
died iii Berlin recently. A Bavarian Jew who
studied under Ehrlich and Koch, he juggled
mightily with bacteria, but will be remem-
bered until Y.D. is expunged, as it can be,
from the list of human afflictions, by the
Wasserman reaction. Apart from that, he
was a big man in Jewish religious affairs—
a leader of his Synagogue, and an official of
the German Zionist movement.
After 49 years’ continuous service in Yic.
Education Department. Herbert B. William-
son. headmaster at the Dandenong State
School, has thrown in his duster in order
to devote himself to botany. He is one of
the few Australians who are Fellows of the
Linnean Society, which has a world-wide
fellowship of not more than 800. On Yic-
torian flora, of which he has the largest
known collection. Williamson is a world
authority. He was a pioneer in school gar-
dening. and encouraged children wherever he
was stationed to make use of the vernacular
instead of the ponderous Latin when identi-
fying plants.
John E. Birt. one of the sitting Laborites
for the Sydney electorate, whose seat is
being “saved" for him, although he’s too ill
to bother much about his own campaign, is
reaping a little compensation for scurvy
treatment accorded him in 1907. In that
year he opposed the late Dr. Graham for
Surry Hills. He had his man well whipped,
when the brilliant and magnetic W. P. ('rick
''deceased) came into the contest and split
the vote. After humping the deadweight of
Crick's 1500 votes Birt was only just beaten
on the post. Everybody said the seat should
be his at the next election, but before that
event transpired the Labor League had been
well packed, and the selection and election
went to an outsider.
FAMOUS WOMEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Besides becoming the wife of Jack Dempsey,
heavyweight boxing champion, Estelle Taylor, the
film actress, directed public attention by introducing
(lie heart curl.”
1 sat and 1 dreamed as the sun. slowly sinking,
Just touched the old farmhouse with fingers of
light,
And it seemed to me then that my leisurely think
ing
Had peopled the dusk of that still, summer night.
For wide-chested men I could see as they labored ;
In place of neat fields still a wilderness grew.
And lire and famine and drought closely neighbored
The ramshackle huts of that pioneer crew.
And women, firm-handed, strong-thewed and deep-
breasted,
Were there with the men they had mated and
borne
111 solit’ry stress in a land that sore tested
And dowered and blessed them, or left them forlorn.
And something l guessed of their strength and their
burden,
In knowledge of now and by dreaming of then ;
And something I felt of their pains and their guerdon,
These pioneer mothers of pioneer men.
But little was left, me of doubt, then, or wonder
That the voice of the sons of such valorous seed
Sh uld be heard o’er the din of Gallipoli thunder:
The colt must run true to its mettlesome breed.
And lowly I bowed and in spirit was humbled,
So little I knew and so little I’d thought,,
That to picture those women my memory fumbled,
And all but forgot was the fight that they fought.
Then swift, fled the shades from a lamp that was
lighted,
But still of the great-hearted mothers I dreamed,
So little renowned and so poorly requited
For bearing and rearing a nation, it seemed.
No long panegyrics for them in the papers,
But much of a great deal more famous a girl ;
Far ends of the earth are informed of her capers,
Who married a bruiser and mothered a curl.

Quiz : "8.J.D.” (B. l(J/4/’25) reminds
me that, although I have steered my equine bark
hundreds of miles through the mulga scrub of Far-
\Vest Queensland by the sun, moon and stars, by
moss on trees, direction of water-courses and cattle-
pads, slope of country, reflection of the light on
a polished knife-blade, etc., and have never
been lost, I got bushed in Brisbane and travelled
in a circle. I left a friend in Clayfield, to which
place I was a stranger, near midnight, and sat on
a seat, smoking, while the last tram went past in
the direction of Newstead, where I was staving.
J hen I sauntered along, steering by the gleam of
electric light on the tram rails, which I knew ran
past my caravanserai. I came to the dead-end of
the tramline, with a racecourse alongside, and was
astonished, because I did not know that I had
turned off at a branch in the line. Secure in the
knowledge of my training as a bushman, I struck
overland, as best I could in view of the fact
that, whereas in the bush I could travel in a straight
line, in the city I had to gc to the corners of
the streets before I could proceed. A little before
daylight, completely bushed, and not having met a
soul, I sat down under a store verandah to wait
for daylight. When it came I saw' the seat I had
started from the night before 50 yards away. When
I got back to the boarding-house and explained the
situation, the landlady smiled a wise smile

Ragar”: Rc peewits attacking and kill
mg one of their own kind while in the air (B
4/ ’ 2 - 5 , ) ; I ’ ve known oth er birds do the same thing.
Jhe wild has no time for anything but physical
perfection, and in sea, land and air the weak and
ailing are killed off by their own kind. Before the
white missionary got busy in S’Africa, the Zulu was
tlie finest physical human in the world, because no
weakling, maimed or deformed person was allowed
to live. The disgrace attached to any woman gjvin°
birth to anything but a perfect child made the Zulu
mother careful both before and after her confinement.
It the mfant were not up to standard, its mother
helil her hand over its mouth and nostrils and
prevented it from breathing. This was one of the
reasons why a Zulu woman was always shut up
alone in her hut for her accouchement.

"J.D.CV’; Can any sheepman among the
Abos. explain the following? How does the number
of wool fibres per
square inch on a lamb
succeed in covering the
square inches on the
skin of a grown sheep?
If additional fibres grow
with the increased size
of the sheep, why is the
fleece still of the same
length? It is well
known that individual
fibres do not increase
in diameter, yet the
wool on a six-tooth is
just as dense as on a
lamb. If a lamb is
“whitewashed” (that
is, merely “topped”)
at, sav, five months old,
the fleece 12 months
later will be even in
length and just as
dense, although the
actual skin surface has
increased something
like 100 per cent. The
increase in area is
gradual, so presumably
the increase in new
fibres is gradual also.
This being the case,
how is it that the fleece
is of even length at
shearing-time? Even on
a sheep which has never
been shorn, at two or
three years old the
length of staple is even,
barring the “lamb tip.”
1 have a sample at
present off a six-toota,
previously unshorn,
which is quite even—
except for the ragged-
looking “lamb tip.”
How is it done?
“Coppertop”: Re “Button’s” par. (B.
30/4/ 25) about desert-pea and waratah. Mv dad got
sorne desert-pea seed from a nurseryman in Brisbane,
who said they had been lying around the shop for
about five years. They were planted in a fresh-
water river-sand bed in a corner of the bush-house
and struck, giving a beautiful show of blooms. The
surface of the sand was never watered by hand but
a pipe driven IBin. into the bed was used’ for
watering under the surface. All sand holds a certain
amount of moisture. That was 15 years ago, but
he has had 110 luck with new seed. He • firmly
believes the older the seed the better, and has a
packet up in the rafters,” to be planted in 19->o
They will then be 12 years old. I knew a well-to-do
lady near Brisbane who spent £l5O on desert-pea
seed and gardeners, yet did not strike one bloom.
“Imbaga”: Let me side with “Booth B.”
(U. 30/4/’2o) when he declares that fish are
usually killed by the explosion of dynamite. I have
been compelled to murder fish with explosives in
many waters, and my invariable experience has been
that the vast majority of the fish are killed and go
to the bottom of the water, salt or fresh. Here
HAD SAMPLED IT.
MISSIONARY : “But, brother, do you know nothing of religion?"
BLACK BROTHER: “Umm! Plenty taste ’im longa other-fellow missionary!"
and there a half-stunned fish or one thrown up bj
the swirl of the explosion shows on top. On on<
occasion I tried to gather in some of a huge surface
shoal of mullet which, shepherded by tailer and othei
sea-jackals, was moving slowly over deep water of
the Kumusi River, in Papua. The charge was
wrapped in newspaper to keep it afloat, and was
not more than a foot under water when it exploded
White bellies flashed on the oily surface for a moment,
tut only half a dozen fish were collected. When
the water stilled again we could see the sandy
bottom below literally white with dead fish. The
accepted theory among us in those days was that
the explosion ruptured the fish’s air-bladder, destroy-
ing its buoyancy at once.

“Tim Baker” : No less an authority than
D. E. Hutchins, responsible for the great South
African eucalypt plantations, considers that mountain
ash (E. regnans) and karri (E. diversicolor) are
the tallest trees in the world. As regards actual
measurements of the latter species, there was exhibited
at the last Paris International Exhibition a section
of a karri certified by a surveyor to have attained
a height of 434 feet. This tree grew in the Karri-
dale timber concession, and some of the old hands
remember it being felled. The W.A. Lands Depart-
ment also possesses photographic records of another
famous karri. This tree measured 242 ft. to the
first branch and, estimating from the photo, Hutchins
thinks it must have been at least 342 ft. in all.
“Arilcurra”: “Oxmead's” comment on
Daisy M. Bates’s theory of the light-haired abo.
lubras (B. i6/4/’25) is more than justified. Does
Mrs. Bates know that, on the Lilia Creek, which
drains the extreme s.-w. corner of the Territory,
there is a tribe of fair-haired abos.? These abos. are
surrounded on all sides by tribes wearing the
regulation thatch, and thus, as well as by distance,
they are out of reach of Mrs. Bates’s miscegenation
theory. As a side issue, these fair-headed abos. have
the reputation of being the fiercest and most treacher-
ous niggers in Centralia.
* * * *
“Spenner”: Here’s a performance which
makes recreation of “J.D.C.’s” weight-lifting (B.
16/4/’2o). Jack McDonald and Tom Chadwick, at
Banyena (\ ic.), loaded 1000 bags of wheat (say
“8 tons) into five trucks each working-day for
several weeks at a stretch. A good many sheep would
need to be lifted 2ft. 6in. to equalise the humping
of a bag of wheat and trotting with it on an
inclined plank anything up to 50 feet. I admit,
though, that their daily cheque also put “J.D.C.’s’’
well in the shade.
* * * *
“W.S.T.”: Tagli Mahomet’s camel (B.
1-1/3/ 2o) and Larraointa’s” i-p P-j■, n > - + -- *]-],, cruelty
of Asiatic drivers (B. 9/4/’25) recall a tragic
instance of how a “bull” got even with his dusky
tormentor. Patty Khan used to boast of the load
of “tinned clog” and other delicacies his bull lifted
from the nearest W.A. railhead, till the bull
got ted up and decided to put an end to the boastful
business. He laid his plans accordingly, and for
several days he was missing. The son of Mahomet
at last spied him in a cleared patch of mulga, and
made for him with malice aforethought. A few
clays later an excited mob of Chans found the
headless body of Fatty, minus an arm, on the edge
of the clearing.
“Ento”: “Veronal” (B. 23/4/’25) errs on
two counts. That blue-black beetle in sheep car-
cases is not a scavenger; it belongs to the family
Histeridae, and its lemon-yellow grub preys on blow-
fly maggots. t'ne grub will destroy a prodigious
number of these and also fly puparia before it
pupates ; it will leave the carcase with the migrating
maggots, following them into the earth, and after
committing havoc there will construct a. hard mud
cell wherein to undergo its transformations. The
Devil’s coach-horse (Staphilinidae) , though forcepless,
looks remarkably like, but is not of, the earwig breed
(Dermaptera ) ; like the Histcrul it belongs to the
order “beetle” ( Coleoptera ). Other beetles in defunct
jumbucks include a red and black chap with no
popular name, and the household “larder beetle,”
both of the family Dermestidae ; also a large, hand
some fellow of the family Silphidae ; even the
family Scarabiidae is represented at times. Not even
a Darlinghurst residential can shelter more families
than does a dead sheep ; I am acquainted with five
beetle, four fly and two parasitic wasp families who
dwell there, and this does not constitute the whole
census, as still smaller fry also make it their home.
* * •» #
‘‘Adelaide”: Professor Wood Jones, the
anatomist at Adelaide Uni., came to Australia mainly
to study marsupials. For a year or two he has been
lecturing and writing that the bushman’s “born
on the teat” theory is absurd, but has been unable to
show any embryo actually in the uterus. The Fauna
and Ilora Board of S.A. supplies him with any dead
specimens from the Flinders Chase reserve on Kan-
garoo Island, and he has now secured two cases
about which there can be no doubt.
“Arilcurra”: “Gouger” (B. 26/3/’25)
writes rubbish about scientists not being game to
study primitive abos. in Centralia. Not only have
they been game enough to go into that country, but
they have studied the nigs, of those parts on their own
camping-grounds. And doesn’t he know that Aus-
tralian Inland Mission parsons from Melbourne and
Sydney suburbs have travelled over nearly all the
Territory and Centralia for the past 15 years? I
myself have roamed several times all over Centralia
—250,000 square miles of it, anyhow—and seen
thousands of niggers, male and female, clad in the
altogether, and hundreds that couldn't speak or
understand English. Nobody patted me on the bad:
atid told me how game 1 was, although I travelled
alone, and I didn’t ask them to. For 45 to 50 years
old stockmen like Alan Breaden, Bill Weldon and
others have roamed all over the nigger country ; and
if tney had the wind up they never mentioned it.

I .A. ; A bit of Australia hopped up in
Ingland during the last hunting season in Ilert-
t*ru..nire. The country pack met at Tring, and after
a short run with a fox the followers were surprised
to see the hounds divided into two packs. The
distraction presently took the form of a wallaby that
had started up at the noise of the chase and had
taken to heart the presence of the dogs. The field
chose to follow the marsupial, which afforded good
tun and eventually got away after a run of a couple
or miles. Subsequent inquiries showed that there
aie plenty of these Australians near Tring. Thev
had made their presence felt by the farmers, through
their marauding under cover of night. Hod°-e
calls them kangaroos, but they belong to the smaller
tribe, and their progenitors had gained freedom at
the expense of an itinerant menagerie. Herts is
, the . onlv county favored by our countrymen.
\\ bust in Devon and riding across a moor at dusk
I was startled into homesickness by a close-up view of
a leal roo that had, apparently, been grazing near by.

A CROSS-WORDS TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Watkins was a happy home-bird, and the envy of
the street.
3tows of lettuces and onions, beds of broccoli and beet,
Beans, tomatoes and such pumpkins as win prizes
at tlie show
Clever Watkins in his garden-plot successfully would
grow.
Watkin’s wifey warbled blithely as she chased the
daily dust,
While her chubby little hubby at the office earned
a crust.
then, her household tasks completed, knitting jumpers
she would wait
fill she heard his homing footsteps and the clicking
of the gate.
Then as Watkins in the bathroom sang the songs
of Araby,
And the eggs and bacon sizzled, oh, a happy spouse
was she!
Life had little more to offer in those joyous, hal-
cyon days—
Till their bliss was turned to wailing by the cross-
words puzzle craze.
Came a day of chill foreboding, when her coy, con-
nubial glance
Saw her husband gaze abstracted, eyes dilated in
a trance;
Saw him slight the steak and onions; while against
his plate he propped
The Bonfire's latest problem, and her heart-beats
nearly stopped.
“Ah, not that!” she wailed in anguish; but her
clinging arms he spurned,
And he worked his fevered pencil as the hour-hand
slowly turned.
Wanly waiting sat his wifey, while the teardrops
trickled fast,
Till he rose and shouted madly: “Ha, I’ve got it
out at last!”
GIVING THINGS AWAY.
THE PASSON : "Ah, brethren, we
Christians hare a beautiful city
of gold, with streets of pearl and gates of precious stones."
COUSIN JACK CHURCHWARDEN (coming up anxiously): "Keep it
quiet, passon, will ’cc? I can see one of them Inkem-Tax
people in the congregation.”
Day by day he bought the paper from the news-
boy at the train ;
Deeper struck the morbid horror in the grey mass
of his brain.
Through the nights with fevered tossings, while his
hopeless lady wept,
Till the milkman’s clatter woke him, he would
mutter- as he slept:
“What’s the proper word for thingumbob, four letters
left to right ?
What’s a word of seven letters to describe mosquito-
bite?
What’s a Bible name, a racehorse or a poet reading
down ?
A fish well known in Mexico? A patent pill? A
town ?”
Ihere is silence in the bathroom where poor Watkins
splashed and sang;
Docks and thistles rankly flourish where the balmy
onion sprang;
And the duster hangs neglected, and the beds are
never made.
Cobwebs gather on the box-broom; rust is on the
idle spade.
VICTORIA.

“Arilcurra”: A word on the sheep-living-
without-water argument. It is not enough, in our
part, anyway, that it should be a good season. It
is essential that it should be a season when parachelia,
munyeroo or melons (not paddymelons) are plentiful.
These all contain sufficient moisture to satisfy the
water-needs of stock, and automatically do
away with the need for ordinary supplies of water.
As these and several other moisture-laden plants
grow more abundantly after good winter rains, the
stock have moisture-laden feed at a time of the year
when they require water least. On Ediacara station
(S.A.) I have seen sheep without a drink for three
months, although they were in a paddock with a
full tank and troughs. They got sufficient moisture
from melons. Teddy Hayes, of Maryvale (C.A.), lost
some well-grown calves which were tracked into
sandy, waterless country east of the station. They
were given up as lost, but three years later turned
up during a dry spell. Teddy, who knows all that
country, reckoned they got their moisture for that
period from parachelia.
* * * *
“D. 8.0.”: Much has been written about
the havoc wrought among flocks by the dingo and
other pests, but one enemy seems to have escaped
censure. It is the seagull. On the Canterbury
plains (M.L.) I have seen this bird stand motionless
for hours waiting till the mother of the newly-
dropped lamb leaves it unprotected. When this
occurs the gull runs swiftly in and pecks out and
ravenously devours the eyes of the lambkin. It
shows a great predilection for eyes. Years ago an
Irishwoman living near Longreach managed to rear
a family of 12 healthy boys. In the laying season
their most highly relished dish was an omelet of
gulls’ eggs. One morning this good woman found
on the beach the corpse of a sailor washed in by the
tide. Both his eyes had been removed. Omelet of
seagulls’ eggs never again appeared on the family
menu.
* * * »
“Sylvester Saveabob” : Apropos of the jam-
tin label cheque given to abos. in payment for their
well-sinking contract (B. 30/4/’25). In North
Queensland a skin-buyer put a cruel one over the
niggers a while back. They brought in quantities
of skins, and he paid them in what they understood
to be £lO-notes. At any rate, they had the figures
‘10” printed all over them. Disillusionment came
when one abo. decided on a
holiday trip. Throwing down
one of his “tenners” proudly,
he asked for his ticket to
Brisbane, and waited for the
change. He got neither it
nor ticket. The skin-buyer
had passed off ten-shilling in
place of ten-pound notes upon
the illiterate blackfellows.
If ever he passes that way
again there will probably be
one crook less in the world.
“Lai”: As to moon-
stroke, I haven’t suffered it
personally, and regard the
story with a suspicious eye,
but would like to know the
origin of the superstition.
The aboriginals believe that
a spirit dwells in the moon
called Muuruup neung kuurn
tarrong gnat (which trans-
lated means “devil in the
moon”), and that its rays
are hurtful. They say that
when the moon is looked on
for too long a period this
evil power makes men spin
round and fall helplessly into
the fire. In the supersti-
tions of bushmen also the
moon plays a big part: for
instance, one should never
leave steel tools exposed to
its rays, because the temper
will be destroyed; it is
also believed that timber
felled at full moon will decay
quickly. The idea that food-
stuffs are rendered poisonous
by exposure to moonlight is
not confined to fishermen
(“Nikko,” B. 2/4/’26), but
is almost universal. When
it comes to weather forecast-
ing the moon is consulted by
the bush weather-prophet.
His forecast is made when
the moon is new; if it is
horizontal, with the horns
pointed upwards, it won’t
rain, the idea being that
water will spill out of the
perpendicular moon, but not
out of the horizontal one.
“X.N.0.” : I can beat “Forebridge’s”
record (B 3 0/ 4/ > 2 5) for high temperatures. When
about the middle of August, 1914, there seemed a
. , .. , .
possibility of action with the Austrian Fleet in
the Adriatic, the destroyer of which I was No. 1
threw overboard all but a few of her spars> her
canvas gear and most of her deck ventilators, as
well as anything else likely to cause a fire or dis-
solve into splinters if we were hit. Shortly after-
wards we went down to Suez as Canal guard, and,
having no ventilators and no awnings, the tempera-
ture in my cabin never fell below 124 degrees while
we were there. Notwithstanding we had only
one man down with heatstroke, and that a very
mild case.
“Emel”: “D.C.” (B. 23/4/’25), in his
reply to “Mag.” might have quoted an even higher
average yield of wheat for a small area of the
Wimmera plains. From 100 acres near Murtoa (Vic.)
2100 bags of wheat were harvested. That was from
land which had originally been bought for £9 per
acre, and which the present owner would sell at
the same price, as he considers it too wet.
* * * *
“Bouragi”: Since writing of the pygmies
of the Fly River watershed in Papua (B. 30/4/’25)
as described by a Papuan magistrate Leo Austin,
I have been reminded
that an old Papuan
contemporary of his
own, Dan Pryke, was
the first to locate and
describe these people
in the British section
of New Guinea. Pryke,
one of a family famous
in the annals of Papuan
prospecting, was in
charge of the exploring
expedition organised by
Rupert Clarke to trace
the sources of the Fly
River, just before the
Great War. A specially-
designed launch was
built at Balmain, and
the party was com-
posed of men experi-
enced in Papuan condi-
tions, including Archie
McAlpine, for long
A.R.M. at Samarai,
and a man with a pro-
found knowledge of
Papuan people. The
expedition worked far
up the river in canoes,
ind explored some of its
upper affluents, includ-
ing the Alice, where
they came in contact
with the pygmies. The
leader and others of
the expedition compiled
voluminous reports, and
these were handed to
the baronet as organiser
and controller of the
venture. War broke
out and obliterated all
interest in the party’s
adventures, of which
nothing was heard save
some brief press inter-
views. Presumably these
reports are still in
S’Rupet’s possession,
and, though the expedi-
tion was his own pri-
vate enterprise, their
publication would have a more than personal interest.
# f # *
“Troophorse”: No doubt, as “Yarrum”
says (B. 23/4/’25), there is safety in numbers where
sharks are concerned. All along the N.T. coast the
natives believe in that same. Say, for instance, a
mob of natives want to cross a crocodile-infested
river. The men will arm themselves with stout
w'addies, and oh entering the water will beat and
splash. Then the old men and gins with kids,
dogs, etc., follow, all chanting, while several young
bucks swim round the flanks and astern splashing
until the opposite bank is reached. I have never
heard of a ’gator attacking a mob of natives crossing
a creek or river in this fashion. But when a single
person attempts the trip he is great bait. Wild
animals also believe in the safety of numbers. I
have seen dingoes and kangaroos collect in small
mobs when crossing to better feed. They had
evidently learnt from experience.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: “Bunya” (B. 23/4/’25) is wrong
in saying that the call of the boobook-owl was
‘mopoke” to the white man. The two are quite
distinct. The boobook-owl (Ninox boobook ) was
“buk-buk” to the blacks. Its twin note is quick and
deep. The mopoke, from the Richmond River to
the Far North, is the red owl (Ninox lurida), and
was called “mobok” by the blacks. It is a sub-
species, and its note is soft and lingering, but far-
reaching. It has not the melancholy sound ascribed
to it by Dismal Dicks, but is as sweet and arresting
as that of the Australian cuckoo. In concert the
boobook calls bass and the mopoke tenor. In
southern regions the tawny frogmouth ( podargus )
is often called the mopoke. It does sometimes utter
an imitation of the mopoke note, but the boobook
never does.
* * * *
“Der Jong”: Australians will find a quaint
flavor in the cable recounting how the Prince of
Wales at Capetown took the “driver’s seat” on an
eight-span ox-waggon. The time-honored Australian
bullock-driver controls his team on foot, working on
the near side, with occasionally an assistant on
the off side. The Afrikander sits proudly on the
waggon-box and deals out punishment to his team
with his whip. This, unlike the Australian’s short
and heavily weighted flagellator, is made of a
long strip of rimpi or green-hide, with a handle as
long as a salmon rod. The actual guiding of the
team is done by the voerlooper, usually a Kaffir
youth, who walks ahead of the leading span of oxen,
holding in his hand a strip of rimpi tied to their
horns. This official is also within reach of the
whip, and in tight corners sometimes gets as much
of it as the oxen.
“Stailayce”: Whilst working on a patch
of heavy timber Gippsland way I had as neighbor,
also cutting and stacking, a youth round whom, to
judge by his build, I could make circles. He
seemed to be able to toss his logs about in a far
easier way than I could, though I’m no slug at it.
During lunch-hour I decided to float over and share
a pipe and convivial pint with him, hoping to glean
the secret of this young David. When I put my
query to him he said: “I suppose you will grin
like the others did and whistle ‘Pretty Joey,’ ” but
I assured him that my whiskers did not allow of
FREEDOM OF SPEECH.
“Before I call on the Nationalist to give his views, I'd ash yer
to give ’im a fair and himpartial ’earing as long as he don’t
say anything ag’in the Labor party.”
grinning or whistling. He thereupon got up and
pulled off his flannel. I saw to my amazement that
he was wearing next his skin a pair of ordinary
women’s front-lacing corsets, hut without any fancy
fal-lals. He then explained that they acted as a
brace to the stomach muscles when lifting, and so
assisted, whilst also lessening the chance of strain.
He was no pretty blue-eyed boy, but a real “dinkum,”
so I rule out vanity.
“Coolabak” : The fishing method described
by “Herodot” (B. 30/4/’25) is reminiscent of the
way we caught crayfish in our childhood. A piece
of meat was placed in a sugar-bag under the water,
the top being tied to a root. In a few hours there
would be a good billy of fish in the bag. They
were generally boiled holus-bolus, the red part
being eaten with a little salt. A deep pool in
the creek or a large dam was usually chosen as a
fishing-ground. Another method, and a much more
exciting way of catching crayfish, was to tie a
piece of cooked mutton to the end of a string and
throw the bait into the dam. When the “tug” was
felt the bait was slowly drawn in. As the Cray’s
feelers came into sight, a grab was made and the
fish landed by hand and helped into the inevitable
billy. But had the water not been purposely
muddied a little, the creature would see the hand
and dive at once.
* * * #
“Tarboy” : Now I can talk pedigrees with
old Derrimut up at Gin Gin. He’s Shorthorn and
I’m Hereford. He’s for ever skiting of ancient
times when there were always Shorthorns and no
Baldies. Me and the missus came down last week
for a bit of a spell, and hearing a lot of talk
about “The Ten Commandments,” we strolled in.
The first part was wonderful: the pictures in the
second part just common stuff we can see any time
at our township, and neither of us could understand
a lot of the yabber printed on the screen. ’Twasn’t
English—but that doesn’t matter. What does
matter is that when the Israelites left Egypt they
took mobs of goats, sheep and cattle with them. Lo
and behold, as sure as- death there was a small
mob of pure-bred Herefords among them. They
had pretty good sorts even in those days. A bit
leggy and too much white, but Baldies all right.
There were a few Ayrshires in the mob, and the
rest were milkers’ calves and scrubbers. But here's
the point. Not a single Shorthorn! I went back
again that night and looked for them. A sheep
cove I met at the pub told me the crossbreds
showed a strong touch of Romney. I don’t know
about that. The Baldies were there, and Derrimut
will learn on good authority that they go back to
Moses.
PIKER’S DELIVERANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A heat wave whitely shimmered on the ghostly mulga
scrub
That stretched away on every side from Piker
Doolan’s pub.
No cooling breath of breeze was felt—only the torrid
heat,
Which seemed to indicate that Hell was not yet
obsolete.
The Scarlet Girl had nought to do; for empty was
the bar;
She lounged upon a sofa, and doze-dreamed of
faces far
And other bare in cities where, in joyful days
gone by,
She used her sparkling repartee and gave the bad,
glad eye.
Old Piker mooched about the place, his temper at
its worst,
And every now and then he sighed, and diligently
cursed.
For business wus simply vile —as vile as vile could be ;
No cheque-man specked the offing for his customary
spree.
The drovers were but memories that ever fainter
grew;
He groaned at recollections of that wind-tanned
roystering crew—
The drovers who had left their sheep in charge of
sulking dogs
What time they' held high carnival, and guzzled
Piker’s grogs.
No sign of life as night came down, and in the
pallid skies
The sad stars glimmered one by one like far, half-
opened eyes.
No sound of any caravan; for Abdul Kundra Bey,
Together with his lurching beasts, was far and
far away.
The Scarlet Girl awakened, but her wakefulness was
vain,
And so she yawned a hopeless yawn and went to
sleep again.
A mangy dog went through the room, and ill was
he at ease;
He came and lay beneath the couch, and analysed
his fleas.
COMPARISONS.
BINKS : “Terrible weather we’re having. Have you ever seen
anything as bad as this Melbourne climate?”
JINKS: “Well, close up—l was a lighthouse-keeper in Spitz-
bergen once.”
“What’s that?” old Piker gave the cry. The Sleeping
Beauty stirred;
For in her hot, tormented sleep the sounds of men
she heard.
“The fencers from Delandra—the fencers flush with
cash 1”
Old Piker shrieked—“ Yes, flush with cheques they’ve
simply got to smash!”
Next morn the Scarlet Woman smiled; aye, she was
well content ;
For many pleasing little gifts to secret places went.
And Piker, too, was satisfied; he didn't curse the
heat....
The spiders that had waited long had found the
flies were sweet!

The new Governor-General’s lady knows
more of S. Australia than she does about
the rest of her husband’s charge. &he was a
Keith-Falconer, one of Lord Kintore’s daugh-
ters ; and Kintore was Governor of the
central province in the ’nineties. Ilis hobby
was driving engines and pottering about
machinery; and that and his friendship with
Moreton Frewen, the bimetallist, led him,
just as he was leaving his other job, to
become interested in the Ashcroft process
for extracting minerals. That never made
any money for anybody; but from that day
to this Lord Kintore has been chairman of
the Sulphide Corporation, which owns the
Broken Hill Central mine, and until
the other day had been a great moneymaker.
Grandpa was the Duke of Manchester; and
he was one of the not very numerous dukes
who have wandered through Australia. But
it is a good while ago now, and the principal
job they found for him to do was to
formally open the Silverton railway, from the
S.A. border to the silverfield. The Keith-
Falconers were a handsome lot, and they
surrounded themselves with goodlookers.
Capt. Anstruther-Thomson, of the Royal
Horse Guards, was one of them. He married
Clayre Tennant, and later they took the
name of Anstruther-Gray on succeeding to
one of the richest estates in Scotland.
On Saturday, at the King’s, Guy Bates
Post, missionary, revived “The Nigger,” an
unwholesome colored play which does not
flatter the morals of the white race. By
Way of apology for his limited repertoire,
G.B.P. delivered a sermon on the White
Australia policy, and hinted optimistically
that this play would make us think, and
Was one that every Australian ought to see.
A crowded house gave a hysterical re-wel-
come to the piebald thing, and Guy shared
in the usual distribution to the extent of
a horseshoe, a boomerang, a sheaf of gigantic
chrysanthemums and a box of chocolates.
Honors of the production went to Gertrude
Boswell as the semi-colored Mammy, Jinny.
Ailsa Grahame airs a three-piece suit of
apple-green, very long of coat, with floral
effect upon the pleated skirt, and a head-
piece or verdant tone and valkyrie wings.
Nellie Mortyne appears in a fascinating
magpie turnout of black-striped satin with
wrigglings of white braid and a black hat.
Revivalers in the audience included Mr. and
Mrs. Louis Nelkin (she was a Madden),
Mrs. Ramsay and daughter, Mrs. Smithers,
the Frank Doyle pair and Mrs. Carty Sal-
mon, looking slimmer and younger since her
trip abroad.
The G.-G. and her Ex. extended the glad
hand and a cup of tea (with orchestral
accompaniment) to delegates of the Church
Congress and leading local lights of the
Anglican persuasion at Federal Government
House the other afternoon. His Grace of
Melbourne also patted the human caterpillar
through fervently. Dull skies frightened the
party into the red-carpeted and palm-dressed
interior, where conversation was all of ser-
vices and sermons. Said one dame, very
much at peace with the world, to another
lady eoually so: “What a beautiful address
Lord Forster gave us —just like a clergy-
man !’’ “Oh, yes,” replied the second ; “hut
that is part of his training for the position,
you know.” No wonder the G.-G. reckons
that his is a job for a younger man.
Why does the Church put on mourning
even in its gayest moods? Wintry trappings
of drab hue were the general wear. Primin-
ister Bruce brought his lady, in black satin
and gold. Mrs. Archbishop Lees was in reseda
green, prinking up black raiment and head-
piece. Federal Minister Groom walked the
carpet with his wife, who wore smart black
millinery and fur. There was even a black
missionary, but lie wore grey; and Rev. Paul
Tso. of China, smiled a bland, impenetrable
smile.
City fathers laid down their differences
and put their feet under Mayor Brunton’s
well-laden table at the Town Hall the other
night. The affair was voted the nicest yet.
From the giant chrysanthemums rising from
gilded baskets to the Moot all was the best,
and the warming of the inner man helped
to thaw the outer crust of even the crustiest
city father. Rare thought shows in the
furnishings of the mayoral rooms, where rose
and black draperies chime with every sort of
raiment. The hostess was a harmony of
silver-beaded black allied to panellings of
silver and black brocade fore and aft, with
magpie-feather fringe. There were dainty
posies for all the women folk, and contralto
Victoria Anderson, soprano Constance Burt,
Thomas George and Colin Thomson sang
charmingly to W. G. Burrell’s accompani-
ments. Mrs. Jeffries scintillated in a black
jetted gown with tracery in colored beads;
city solicitor “Pompey” Elliott brought his
wife in jade-blue brocaded taffeta; Councillor
and Mrs. Bell made a whole carillon with
their three daughters; and there were dozens
more of citizens who would rather be thought
useful than ornamental.
Members of the Austral Salon drank tea
to music in honor of the Allan Wilkie pair;
but the leads, alas, were not there to answer
the call, and the curtain went up without
e-en understudies to fill the gap. Last-week
rehearsals of daily revivals caused the non-
arrival of the popular Shakspearean mum-
mers, who have since taken their props, to
other pastures. The Australs buried their
disappointment bravely in talk, and Marie
McGann, Dulcie Cherry, Alice Bell and
others did their best to cheer them up with
melody. Dulcie Cherry, by the way. has
thrown in her lot with the Wilkie company
and gone a-touring.
Her Ex., powder-blue coated and flounced,
spent morning-teatime on Thursday at St.
Kilda Town Hall, opening the half-yearly
sale of work of the Gentlewomen’s Aid
Society. Said association at present num-
bers 115 ladies of advanced years and re-
duced circumstances who need the help these
sales supply. Articles for purchase ran from
pickles, jams and cakes to the most exquisite
of stitcliery. Competitions for money prizes
encourage a high standard of work. The
society lias been in existence for well over a
quarter of a century. Mrs. Tremearne, widow
of a well-known medico of Creswick, at pre-
sent presides over the committee, which is
secretaried by Miss Ethel Flower. A bridge
party on Thursday afternoon produced a
cheque for the sick fund of the society.
Leafless poplars, the elms and oaks mak-
ing a brown and yellow carpet in the gar-
dens, a robin astray in the city, and baskets
of wild heath of every hue of pink proclaim
that winter is here. Yet so far the cold is
negligible—to the delight of shoppers; for
the high-priced topcoat of to-day is the
bargain of to-morrow.
The mushroom season is also with us,
and seeking the succulent fungi is just _as
popular among the romantic as gathering
shells upon the seashore or pink heath upon
the hills. The lowlands around Melbourne
produce mushrooms so prolifically that actu-
ally special trains are talked of for the
convenience of gatherers.
The visiting English pianist, Dorothea
Vincent, was introduced by the B.M.S. over
Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy Dyer’s teacups on
Saturday. Hostess added immense Oriental
ear-rings to Grecian draperies of trailing
silver foliage upon a blue ground. Alberto
Zelman and his trio of maidenly instrumen-
talists gave some Frank Bridge; Dorothea,
in lime-green crepe kasha, spoke of modern
British music; and Miss Crawsliaw Wilson
roused interest in Dalcroze eurhythmies,
which are things apart from the usual gyra-
tions associated with scanty clothing. In
the throng were Dr. and Mrs. Riddell Stan-
ley, solicitor Pirani and his wife (tlieir
pianist son. Max, is now established in
London), Mrs. Alberto Zelman, Solicitor-
General Garran and his lady, and Mr. .and
Mrs. Vanderkellen —he a son of the Belgian
Consul.
Margery Herring, here pictured by
Dickinson-Monteath, is a B.Sc. who for six
years has been Principal of the Janet Clarke
Hall. Since
Countess
Stradbroke
founded the
Girl Guides,
threeyears ago,
she has been
attached t o
the executive
as a sort of
head trainer.
Mrs. Arthur S.
Woolcott, Dis-
trict Commis-
sioner of the
Guides at St.
Kilda, handed
her an ivory
notebook at the
Quamby Club
the other day
to keep the
dates of her
approaching
European
jaunt. The traveller promised, though on
vacation bent, to have a look into Guiding
matters. All guests found themselves shar-
ing the good wishes, for wee horseshoes
flower-deck-'d with Guide colors were at-
tached to the place cards.
Though the Treasury and Fitzroy Gardens
are separated only by a street, the two are
under different management. The City
Council takes pride in making the Fitzroy
pleasaunce a thing of beauty and a joy for
all seasons, but the Government has let its
acres run to seed. Its recent offer to hand
the neglected greenery over to the city fathers
was turned down because the gift was not
well enough gilded. Indignation at this slight
has stirred the Government’s Advisory Com-
mittee to set the scythe and the spade doing
overtime in the Treasury reserve, and the
C.C. is to be shown what a real garden
is like.
This is the decorative and glowing Blamire
Young, whose show of water : colors at the
Athenaeum Hall represents his very latest
liigh-tide mark. Patrons have been many,
and purchasers
include Lady
S t r a dbroke,
whose eye was
charmed by
the “Crimson
Glory” of a
sunset. Critics
o f the old
school, wh o
acknowledge no
other method
save that of
John Sell Cot-
man, look
somewhat .as-
kance at the
revolutionary
man ipulation
of textures.
B u t fellow-
artist Stree-
ton, in a fine
burst of gen-
erous praise,
says some or tire present landscapes are the
finest water-color paintings yet done in this
land, and suggests that the National Gallery
should sign a cheque for a whole armful.
The foundation-stone of the hundredth cot-
tage of the Old Colonists’ Homes lias been
laid. The virile organisation, whose object
is to provide for the old age of deserving
pioneers, was last year placed on the list
of recognised charities for a slice of Govern-
ment assistance; but it is to its credit that
it declined the proffered assistance, sturdily
confident of its ability to finance its own
affairs. The movement was started 55 years
ago, and the hundred homes cost about
£3.8 000 to build, but are probably worth
£lOO,OOO on to-day’s values. At the latest
foundation-stone laying, whereat Governor
Stradbroke did the needful, one of those
present was a daughter of George Coppin,
who was a foundation member of the society
and gave it a start with some benefit per-
formances.
Twelve past and present students of Wes-
ley gave the dying flutter of the Head of the
Iliver frivols —to w r it, a dunce at Ormond Ilall,
when homage was paid alike to the victorious
Scotch and the defeated Wesleys. The Fair-
bairn Cup, presented for several years past
to the winners, owes its existence, by the
way, to the interest of the late Mrs. Charles
Fairbairn. It was nephew Jim who handed
over the coveted goblet to the Scotch crew
this year. The evening found Mr. and Mrs.
Jim having a family party at the Oriental,
with the Allan Spowers pair, pretty Norah
Currie and Mr. C. Forrester, brother of the
hostess, to leaven the domestic pie. The
pale blue of Geelong Grammar School prinked
up the tablecloth.
Ella (Babe) Lee, daughter of the Fred
Lees, of St. Ivilda, said “I will” to Ernest
Mieville, of Sussex (Eng.), at St. Pat.’s
Cathedral. The bride’s late grandad, Allan
McLean, was Premier of this State once
upon a time, and C. A. Lee, who lately gave
the N.S.W. Parliament best after nearly
40 years of it, is another grandpa. To ivory
georgette and a French lace veil the bride
added heirlooms of pearl necklace, brooch
and ear-rings, which good Queen Vic. gave
to great-great-grandma Mrs. MaiCullagh,
wife of a famous landscape painter of the
period. Cousin Lorn a McLean ’maided in
cerise velvet brocaded georgette, and Alan
Gavan Duffy best-manned. The after-
rejoicing. attended by relatives and a few
old friends, was at Menzies’.
Society rejoices at the return to Toorak
of Walter Bayles and his wife, who, with
Barbara, Shirley and Betty, have been sam-
pling the charms of Norway and St. Moritz.
Within the life of the present Parliament
four of the younger Federal Labor members
have married wives. The latest to speculate
in a wedding-ring is ex-schoolteaclier F. A.
McDonald, who represents Barton (N.S.W.),
and who married a widow, Mrs. I. B. Burnet,
of Hobart, a sister of Captain Ambrose
Carmichael, one-time Minister of Education
in N.S.W., and sponsor of the short-lived
Soldiers and Citizens’ party. The wedding
was a quiet little business at Scots’ Church.
Melbourne experienced its politest strike
last Saturday. Dissatisfied with certain
time conditions, the tram-men decided for
once to observe the regulations. An amazed
public found trams being held up at each
street corner whilst the name of the street
was called and a suave inquiry made as to
whether anyone wanted to get out; and per-
fectly hale people were courteously assisted
to the ground. At midday trams were run-
ning 60 minutes behind schedule, and 120
passengers was the average allowance for a
car with seats for 36. A too parsimonious
interpretation of awards by the employers
is given as the reason for the “strike”; and
the Melbourne Tramways Board is certainly
not over-generous.
Betty, only daughter of the P. W. Nunns,
had her coming-out dance in Oakleigh Hall
on Friday night. Youth tripped it in the
ballroom, which was all pink blossoms, heath
and autumn foliage. The leading girl was
prettily gilded in lamd and lace, sprinkled
with floral effects. Beads glistened upon the
orchid mauve upholstery of the hostess.
Marie Tait. who gracefully glided in pale
gold, and Joyce Challingsworth and sister
Edith, in pink and white respectively, were
of the many bonnie lasses present.
Old Collegians of the P.L.C. rallied one
evening last week at their Alma Mater, and
handed headmaster Gray a casket of Aus-
tralian wood hiding a cheque for £7OO, a
first instalment towa*ds the Jubilee Mem-
orial Fund. A pageant representing all
fashions through which the school has passed
during its 50 years was the chief entertain-
ment.
Much giving in marriage is listed for next
month. The John Winter-Irving family is
having a double event in the nuptials of
daughters Margaret and Joan on June 24;
and Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Hall-Thompson
are calling the Navy together to hear what
daughter Mary Valerie has to say to Ronald
Austin on the 9th at St. John’s, Toorak.
From Moonce Ponds hails Dr. Ann Mac-
leod, only chick of W. E. B. Macleod, who
topped the list of women doctors at Mel-
bourne Uni. this year. There isn’t a thread
of the blue stocking about Ann, who can go
round the links with a pretty fair card, can
ride and drives her own pytrol-waggon
through the city without adding to the
casualty-list.
The fancy football match between mum-
mers and the gents who call the odds, in aid
of the Rotarians’ Boy Scouts appeal, was
a crowded though damp affair. Alfred Frith,
aided by Cecil Kelleway as a plump Cupid,
led the Stage to victory. The game was a
succession of falls and posings for the
numeron: photographers. Maud Fane,
suited in red-brown tweed, made the pre-
liminary kick-off. Outside interest centred in
the leading ladies, who sold sweets and
flowers. Of these were Pauline Frederick
in cinnamon-brown and felt headpiece, and
June Elvidge, wearing cheerful plaid upon a
black costume, who duly decorated Governor
Stradbroke with her wares. Mrs. A. V.
Hiskins, Aggie Brenan and Effie Ball were
chief stall-holders.
Receptions and things in Adelaide: —
This village is chock-a-block with itinerant notables,
and there have been revels in consequence. There
was a mayoral tea-party at the Town Hall, with
roses and chrysanthemums as a background for
Irene Vanbrugh’s befringed black frock and wide-
rimmed hat and her hostess’s white and crystal-
beaded marocain. Rehearsals kept Mrs. Brough, away,
but Beatrice Day came with Ethel Wellesley and
Jai.et Eccles, and Mrs. Slaney Poole was there in
black with a grey-clad daughter. On the same
afternoon S’Langdon Bonython was host —for Presi-
dent Josiah Symon, who is away—at a Royal Colonial
Institute party in the Brookman Hall, with his
daughter, Mrs. Angas Parsons, as his chief lieuten-
ant. The affair was staged in honor of the Frederick
Duttons, who are staying with the 11. H. Duttons,
but a temporarily crippled knee made the lady
an absentee.
Bridge and dancing divided the honors at a
frivol at St. Mark’s College in aid of itself. The
old ballroom was hung with the college colors of
red, yellow and blue. The acting-viceroy Pooles
were there, the Bishop Thomases and the mayoral
Glovers, with a big sprinkling of the older set. The
Grenfell Prices did the honors, and to them and
Mr. C. J. Glover most of the affair’s success is due.
Apropos of money-raising, the Cathedral has got
£lO,OOO of the £25,000 it wants.
The drought broke on top of the Cup meetings and
drove lovely woman into sou’westers and gumboots.
Tweeds and furred coats with velour hats for giddy
color-notes were almost the only wear on Saturday,
and such finery as appeared on Cup Day was mostly
tucked under heavy top-dressings. The Pooles, keen
racegoers since he donned the administerial shoes,
were there with their daughter; so was the
visiting Indian Prince.
The week has brought a couple of engagements—•
Mollie, youngest of the Charles Todd daughters, to
Leonard Marriott; and Jean, daughter of the Hill
Smiths, of Yalumba, to Colin Matheson.
George Cowan said the opening word for Thea
Proctor’s show, and Ernest Watt breathed a second
benediction. A grey day dulled the pictures, but
couldn’t veil their charm; and there was soon a
rash of red seals on them.
The Gardiner, Clive Milne and Herbert Rymill
dames were hostesses at a dance at the Liberal Club
rooms, with Mrs. Rymill’s just-grown-up son, Henry,
and Janet Gardiner as the hero and heroine of the
frivol. The deb. was a shimmer in silver, with
forget-me-nots and pink rosebuds for her bouquet
and on her shoulder; her mother was in black, and
Mrs. Rymill in vivid blue georgette. Illness in the
family kept Mrs. Clive Milne away, the one blur on
a cheerful evening.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

SILK
STOCKINGS
The week turned on its blackest look and
its heaviest downpours to greet the opening
of the polo season. Still. Kensington drew
its hundreds of spectators —most of them, it
is true, warm and snug under the hoods of
their motors, though there was a thin line of
lookers-on without ears, and some even with-
out macs hanging over the barriers. Through
sheets of rain they saw the quicker and more
flashing N.S.W. team of Reds heat the Alaori-
landers. Some of the Ilawkcs Bay team are
heavyweights, notably their captain. Willie
Alackenzie, and there was none of them
showed anything like the form of Major
White, the crack of the Reds. Midway
through this match General Rain scored the
greatest victory, and sent every un-earred
person scuttling for shelter to the far-away
stands of the racecourse or to the tea-tents.
Through dour rain the match was played to
a finish ; but the match between Victoria
and N. S. Wales Whites had to he post-
poned till Monday, when Vie. scored a brilli-
ant win. Of course, nothing short of a Fuji-
yama upheaval would keep the flapper away
from a polo match ; so they came, many
of them in the newest thing in ochre-colored
legs, crocodile or near-crocodile shoes, batik
scarves, woolly outfits, topcoats and sticks.
One or two boasted suede coats. Aliek
Ricardo’s was in brown : with this she flew
a scarf the blue of Dutch pottery. Audrey
Alaple Brown was coated and hatted to tone
with her own name; Premier Fuller’s lady
and daughter Gwen and Mrs. Jimmie Ashton
and tall Airs. England were among the on-
lookers ; Auckland girl Betty Sharman got
out in time to pipe a last exhortation to the
losing side; and the whole Tony Hordern
family and George Lambert, in leggings and
a horsey grey cap. sped the season on its
way.
Following the example of the Drama and
the Aorangi, the new P. and 0. liner Cathay
celebrated her first visit, to Port Jackson
with a junketing. The Cathay, though
neither so large nor so ornate in her furnish-
ings as the. Drama, has an atmosphere of
more homely comfort. The smoking-room
and lounges, with their big open fireplaces
in which electric switches produce the
modern equivalent of ye olde log. were a
joyful refuge from the murk of one of the
dirtiest nights of a sloppy week. Even the
jazz band ran a poor second in the popu-
larity stakes. The upper deck, to which only
the persistent jazzers stuck, wore a yellow
rose above its ear, and otherwise was hanked
with gum-leaves bathed in golden lights. But
under the lanthorns of the raftered smoke-
room, and in the full gaze of one-time Kings
of England who looked down eonvivially from
prints upon the walls, the best drink-service
was in motion. Punctually at 8.30 Gordon
Wesche was at the head of the gangway to
do the honors, and for an hour onwards a
stream of the best cloaks in Sydney passed
under his gaze with the regularity of a
mannequin parade. The Naval Captain
Robins couple came, she in brocades and
georgettes of the shade the novelists describe
as ocean greyhound. Commander Quick
brought his lady, and the Frank Hewson
matron, wrapped in gold lace, was one of
the high lights in the night’s firmament.
Parma violet georgette and grey clipped fur
combined to clothe another enviable person.
Airs. Claude Healev brought daughter Alimi.
and the Campbell Alaefie couple were others
who helped thread the hours with good cheer.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh shimmered in white
satin and silver, and was led out in the
dance by Town-Clerk Layton. He. by the
way. is a grandfather three weeks old.
Daughter Alntlie's son and heir will in the
years to come sign “John Layton Rous” on
his income-tax return.
As usual, every woman visitor thought it
her duty to rake the boat fore and aft:
cabins, bathrooms, corridors and fittings had
the microscope turned on them. Wardrobe
doors were swung open and dressing-table
drawers pulled out —“to see if they worked
smoothly.” Discussion as to the sorts of
wood that panelled the cabins was grave and
prolonged. One young lady grew quite hot
insisting that a specially luxurious suite was
in sycamore. But surely even a P. and 0.
designer would not be such a grim humorist
as that. Incidentally, it is told that a
daughter of Lord Inchcape is the interior-
decorator for these liners—at a salary of
£3OOO a year.
The Town Hall chairs have had to he
jambed till there is not knee-room between
them to accommodate the thousands who in-
sist on going to every Kreisler . concert.
Everybody who has read Tolstoi’s novel
lapped up the “Kreutzer” with a cat-after-
the-cream air, though the pianists in the
audience complained that the top of the
piano should have been thrown wide, as the
keyboard is as important in this work as
the stringed instrument. But there —when
Gabriel sounds his trump there’ll be some-
one to complain that he is off-pitch. The
most sumptuous wrap that purred over the
“Kreutzer” enfolded Hugh D. Mclntosh’s
lady. It was of tail-less ermine, knee-
length. and seemed to have an acre or so
of pelts in its make-up. Queensland's ex-
Premior Theodore and his lady were front-
seaters last Saturday night, and the matinee
on Friday found almost every actor in
Sydney “out front.” There wore other
guests of the management that afternoon—-
rapt row after row of blinded soldiers. They
were there at the violinist’s special request.
One of the biggest parties Kreisler had
thrust upon him was a lunch hosted by
Hugh D. Mclntosh. The irrepressible and
Bis lady summoned about 100 guests to sa.v
“Glad to meet you !" to the musician and
Mrs. Kreisler; and the wonderful feast was
spread at the Ambassadors.
Bertie Kelly, who loves music and plays
the violin like a professional, has been at
Kreisler's feet since the great one's arrival.
He arranged a water party for the artist and
Mrs. Kreisler, preceded by a lunch at the
Royal Yacht Club. Incidentally, Kreisler.
who was told that the sun always shone
over Sydney, composed a nocturne last Sun-
day week inspired by the threnody of'that
day’s rain.
The party the violinist liked best of all
was at the Conservatorinni. Here, in the
little tearoom on top of the floors where
genius is trained, Arundel Orchard, the
teachers and some of the pupils spread 4
o'clock for the Master and his accompanist.
Later on Airs. Kreisler came in to take her
husband home, and immediately had affairs
in hand and told the gathering how much
more beautiful it would he right out on the
roof—the afternoon was one of the few
fine ones in the past fortnight. Poor Mrs.
Kreisler! She had been told that “sunny
weather was prevalent” in Sydney, and every
time she has stirred abroad she has been
encompassed with topcoat and umbrella.
Miss Preston Stanley was duly launched
on her election campaign last week in the
gaze of hundreds of Feminists and admirers
at the Town Hall. Knight Frederick Waley
and the “dry” Air. Hammond helped the
gallant craft of Woman’s Parliamentary aspi-
rations off the slips, and Airs. R. R. Alaekin-
non. Airs. Lnvcrty, Airs. John Fell and the,
Waley dame stood by waving bannerettes of
fair words.
This pretty girl was Love Lawler, of
Sydney, till last Alonday night ; now she is
Mrs. Vaughan
Joyn o r. of
Adelaide. One
of elocution-
teacher Harry
Thomas's most
brill i a n t
pupils. Love
put a thrill
into many con-
certs and en-
t e r tainments
with her mag-
netic speaking
voice. She has
a pretty gift
for music, too.
and her long-
suit is musi-
cal monologue.
Her classic
profi 1 e and
soft, brown
hair. neither
bobb e cl nor
shingled, are still remembered in the North-
ern Rivers towns, where she toured two
years ago under Harry Thomas’s manage-
ment.
The civic stronghold is not to be left be-
hind in giving a hand in the campaign
against consumption. Mayoress Cecilia
Walsh is organising a ball for June 29, the
funds to benefit the T.B. Soldiers and Sailors.
It was at one of the committee meetings for
this ball that Sir Dudley de Chair suggested
that no special supper should be provided
for the Vice-Regals and their party —the
viking’s very sensible suggestion towards
cutting down the caterer’s bill.
It is fitting that Gladys Owen, whose
mother was such a pillar of the Red Cross
organisation in its infancy here, should be
the originator of the society's scheme to put
ginger into the fight against T.B. The first
move in the game is the enlarging of Boiling-
lon, the Red Cross Sanatorium at Wentworth
Falls. At present there are 30 soldier-
patients, and the running expenses are £9OOO
a year. It is now proposed to take 70
civilian eases, and for the total hundred
£16.000 will foot the hi IK A market day
or maybe a week of social activities in Sep-
tember is being organised. The Government
has already promised to subsidise 30 of the
proposed 70 beds, and, of course, if any of
the patients wish to pay something towards
their board no violent opposition will be met
with.
The Armituge-Buchanan wedding was the
most stirring recent episode at Sutton
Forest. The bride was Lurline Buchanan,
the man Jim Armitage, and the rendezvous
the local All Saints’ Church, where Padre
Carver was waiting for them. Bride’s only
sister, Mrs. Boris Miller, had conic all the
way from Canada to be matron of honor ;
and Captain Cootc took a day off from Gov-
ernment House to he best man. Two brides-
maids looking like an autumn symphony fol-
lowed the bride’s pearl-crusted ivory satins;
and the toasts were drunk at Moondnmi
(which same is nbo. for “the dwelling-place
of happiness”). This wedding is a further
link in a chain of friendship that has bound
tlic two families for years—bride’s and bride-
groom’s fathers were great, chums.
Pianist Charles Philip made a stir in
musical circles the other day by going in off
the deep end and joining the married men.
lie did it at Randwiek, his principal lady
being Julia Barnett Goldstein, of Coogee.
Charles is a son of the late l)r. O. Philip, ot

Something more talked about than the
Bridge on the North Shore at the moment
is the engagement of the medical Throsbys’
daughter Peggy to Dr. Cookson, medical
superintendent of the Royal North Shore
Hospital. His father was a well-known
Balmain medico.
Scott Fell's daughter Catherine has just
given the right answer to a leading question
put by Dr. Anderson Stuart. He’s a son of
the late learned Professor and blushes under
the front names of Bouveric Primrose.
Another ring event worthy of note is the
engagement between Phyllis Tibbits, only
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. E. J. Tibbits, of
Milton, Dubbo and Mayfield, Barcaldine
(Q.), and Rex Robinson, son of the Ralph
Robinsons, of Vaucluse.
A rumor persists that Sydney will see Mrs.
Pitt Rivers again when Dion Boucicault
comes back to produce for the Firm. Irene
Vanbrugh says she is going to take a year’s
leave of absence from the footlights, and
both Dion and Irene have helped coach the
G.-G.’s handsome daughter for some of her
amateur nerformances; so if Mrs. Pitt
Rivers returns as Boucicault's leading lady
it won’t be altogether unexpected.
Gloria McFadyon was the 250th girl to
come tripping into the Maytime Ball at the
Palais the other night, and Luck dropped
a prize into her hand. But, all in all. it
was the Sydney Hospital Auxiliary that had
the luck, for hundreds of girls entered the
Sheik’s Palace after Gloria, and each girl
represented 6s. in her own right and 6s. in
her partner’s; for, of course, any girl scorns
to go a-jazzing these nights without a ‘‘John”
of her very own. The Palais never lias
been gayer: everything was very young, and
rite dancing nymphs and sylphs alternated
the already out-moded tube with the newer
georgette frocks that float either in scarf-
ends or fringe or pleated panel. The presi-
dent of the flutter was Joseph Carruthers’s
lady, and she combined dignity with gaiety
in plum-covered satin and chenille. Mrs.
Pnlfreyman and Mrs. T. Fiasclii were the
secretaries, and the I\ J. Horton and It. C.
Winn matrons looked after the treasury.
The first epistle of Bt. Paul's to the
Jazzonians: Make ye ready for the yearly
dance that will be held at the College on
Wednesday, June 17.
The wide vogue of Farmer's Broadcasting
Station was brought vividly borne to listeners-
in the other evening. After spinning a nice
tall fish yarn for the benefit of bis Aus-
traiian audience, M. Hagen, a visitor from
the islands, broke into a stream of French
that puzzled many, ft was a little greet-
ing to bis family in .Noumea, New Caledonia.
One of the brightest productions tlu*
S.U.D.S. has ever been guilty of was Ber-
nard Shaw’s “Devil’s Disciple,” which failed
to fill SI. James's Hall on three nights of
last week. The Uni. dramatics are very
modest, though—they never seem to expect
overflow houses. But if they will continue
with similar plays, and encourage such play-
ers as the astonishingly good Wilfred Blanket
and (lie promising Carl Gunther, they are
threatened with success. This Letter hates
to say it, but the girls in the play might
be quoted as just so many reasons why men
leave home.
The undergrads, of Sydney Uni. are seeth-
ing over the refusal of the Senate to allow
the continuance of the traditional capping
procession. The Senate is all for a stny-
in-your-own-back-yard celebration, and con-
siders that the students’ function might well
be held within the Uni. grounds. The stu-
dents have given their word that nothing that
could bring a blush even to a Senator's
cheek shall blemish any future procesh. but
the Senate is adamant. There have been as
many pourparlers and special couriers used
over the business as over the llulir occupa-
tion —and the matter seems settled just about
as satisfactorily.
The Millions Club is making its first
butterfly flight at the Ambassadors early
next month. The occasion is a ball sacred to
the interests of art. The club has been
doing its bit for the Australian artist by
Intying his pictures at the different exhibi-
tions, and the gate-money from this cheerio
will help to replenish the treasury before
the pictures come out in the spring shows.
June 3 and the Wentworth are the time

first Australian breach-of-promise case (Cox
r. Pavne) was tried at Sydney on that day
in 1825.

College will hold their annual dance on May

A P.S. from Brisbane: —
The Scotchbyterians have been pouring much tea
in connection with Home -Missions at St. Andrew’s
Hall. Moderator Henderson presided over a house-
ful of guid Scots names, and Mrs. Thomson super-
vised the haggis or whatever Scotchmen eat at
lunch-time.
Merna < allies opened the piano-lid for a large
audience in the Albert Hall the other night. Vera
Morcorn —in private life the wife of Georgeson of
the CouniKß. —helped her by singing delightfully in
a frock of moonlight on rippling waters; and Scott
McCalluni played upon the fiddle. The stage was
heaped with vegetable and sugary -tributes before
the evening ended.
bindley Evans, who played for Melba ; Frank
Hutchens, who has been judging the music items in
the Windsor eisteddfod; and Harrison Allen are
combining their talents at the Elite. At the
Theatre Royal Allan Wilkie opens with “School
for Scandal,” and His Majesty's is dusting itself in
readiness for Galli-Curci’s opening night.
At Goondiwindi’s race-club festivities the flocking
savored nothing of the backblocks. Mrs. Gore was
in pastel georgette and Mrs. Willie Goodrich in
magenta ; Airs. G. W. Watson chose black panne,
.lean Rae mauve satin. Mrs. Max Gibson white chiffon
satin, and Mrs. J. H. Ross red silk laee.
Warwick also indulged in a picnic-race bail in
the Exhibition Building. Among the smart dressers
were Beryl Rosser in emerald and gold, the Dent
maiden from Sydney in powder blue and rose-pink,
and Lorna Brookes in ashes of roses.
Supper at the Sketch Club’s ball consisted of
smoking saveloy's, lollysticks and sugar frogs, and
tlic fancy dresses were all juvenile. It almost seems
as if our intelligentisa were trying to copy Sydney’s
annual outbreak.
Hamilton Town Hall saw the dance given by
Captain and Mrs. Hughes. The Westmoreland’s
Hags decorated the hall, and officers and cadets assisted
the Captain to make glad the hour. The Eric Ann-
ings, the P. J. Symes, Lefanus, Buchanans, Doris
O’Mahony, Kathleen Hirschfeld, Evelyn Hutton,
Charles Dearden and officers of the Cumberland and
Wangaratta helped to crowd the floor.
At St. Morris station, Charlevillo. a knot was
tied a week ago that made Mona O’Sullivan of Mount

A proud aunt is Mrs. Drummond Macphevson, of

aunt acting as hostess.

NOTIONS
Sweep-money and £1250 • liung up by the
club made the Newcastle Cup a very attractive affair
this year, and there were 19 starters. On the
strength of his consistent running on Sydney courses
Iviga was made favorite at 7 to 2, and, galloping
smoothly on the sodden track, he showed the way
home to the desperately unlucky local mare Irish
Flower and Bailie’s meal-ticket Dialogue, both well
in the market. Three lengths was the margin
between first and second and the 11 furlongs were
run in 2min. 23sec. Owned by D. Livingston and
ridden by young Hewins, Kiga is a six-year-old
gelding by Eaton Lad, sire of Easingwold, out of
Lady Melba, dam of Dunwil.
Valamita has proved himself a good miler.
and may develop into a stayer, but "his party showed
poor judgment in matching him against a smart
little mare like Chatterbox, nicely handicapped and
very fit, in a six-furlong handicap at Moorefield, and
that in heavy going. As it happened, he couldn’t
gallop fast enough in the scamper to the turn, and
though he was putting in long ones in the straight
he was beaten into third place by Chatterbox (5 to 2)
and Budtrim, the Magpie—Galtee Princess mare
winning easily. She has been given Bst. lib. in
the Flying Handicap at Randwiclc next Saturday,
and with a 51b. allowance and young Hillier aboard,
may do it again, even though the company will be
more select. Jack Kelso, her youthful trainer,
believes in making horses earn their oats when they
are thoroughly well. Royal Howard (2’s) beat
seven others in hollow fashion in the Maiden Hurdle.
Certainly they were rather a poor lot, but he shaped
as if hurdling had cured him of his piggish habits ;
if so, he will soon add to his list of successes on
the flat, which includes the 1923 Queensland Cup.
Though three of the eight winners were favorites,
McShortodds, as usual, went home ahead of it, two
rank outsiders turning up.
* * * *
The Adelaide Cup went to one of the Vic-
torian visitors, as did so many other prizes during
the S.A.J.C. meeting. Greatly fancied were Drongo,
Stand By and Wycherley, with Jackstaff, Bold and
Bad and Gungool all backed down to 7 to 1 or less.
But they were all out of it. In the heavy going
there was a desperate finish between two Melbourne
horses, lightly weighted, and W. R. Morgan’s Stralia
(True Scot —Austra), a five-year-old carrying only
fist. 10lb., got the official verdict of half a head
from Stuart Brunton’s The Tyrant with 7st. 131 b.
Old Dependence, the winner six years ago, was a fair
third, at the head of a tailed-off field. Somebody
had a fancy for Stralia rather late in the day, and
the dividend was only £B. In the S.A.J.C.
Handicap, the big race on the concluding day, horses
from Victoria were first, second and third.
Wycherley, the Leger colt, took the lead a furlong
from home, and he had enough left in him ‘■o
withstanl a challenge from that ill-starred brute
Drongo, belated as usual. Prince Tressadv. who
won twice during the meeting, credited Victoria
with the last race, the Totalisator Handicap. He
was favorite, and three other favorites got home
during the day : another dead-heated. Backers of a
second horse—Vapor in the Highweight Handicap—
collected a peach of a dividend —£25 18s. for £l.
* * * *
As at Epsom (Vic.) the previous week,
A. G. Barlow took out the Plate at Sandown Park
on Saturday, this time with Prenosterer ; and Charle-
cote was runner-up again. Royal Thought, the Epsom
winner, also ran. but the money indicated that
Preposterer was the stable fancy, and the Absurd-
First Class colt, backed down to 5 to 2, got to the
front after the first furlong- and won just as he
liked. Expensive Murray King (5 to 2) was pre-
ferred in the 10-furlong handicap to the well-
credentialled Pukka (3’s), but both went down ulti-
mately to Maltarda (B’s), who was badly interfered
with by Pukka at the halt-distance. For that reason
rhe stewards took the race away from Pukka, who
beat Maltarda home by two lengths, and disqualified
Bevis, the Tasmanian gelding’s rider, for two months.
The sentence is more severe than it looks, for the
unfortunate young man was booked to ride Pukka
in all his mainland engagements, and the horse is
pretty sure to do well while he retains his condition.
“Hasen”: The exhilarated punter had evidently
backed the winner of the race just run at Sandown.
Right and left he gathered willing hangers-on to
celebrate his success. The second round was ending
when the bearer of bad tidings arrived. "Backed
Pukka, didyer?” he scoffed. “Well, there’s a protest.”
The celebrater laughed uproariously. “Ah, you can’t
kid. me,” he said. “Fill ’em up again, John.” The
bairman had just filled them when fresh comers con-
firmed the news. “Bah!” said the happy punter,
*’s all rot, anyway. They couldn’t take it off him.
Fill ’em up, Claude.” 1 saw him again breasting
the bar after “Protest Upheld” had been put up.
“Of course, they’ll appeal,” he was telling his nearest
companion. “Fill ’em up, Walter.” He was having
his next when they told him that “No Appeal” had
been posted. For a moment his jaw dropped. Then
he said, “Oh well, 1 only put five quid on it. I
was going to have a tenner. Fill ’em up, Clarence.”
Then 1 knew that I’d struck the Complete Philosopher.
“Timo”: McShortodds usually holds big
money on the Brisbane Thousand, and last year
Clairveaux gave him a skinner. Next Saturday’s
Thousand looks open. Calm Laddie, already the
winner of one, and Admetus, twice successful, are
fancied, and there will be good money for the
rather mean-looking Siege Lass, a daughter of
imported Bachelor’s Persse, whose stock are paying
their way. The Lass is a slow beginner, but she
lir/k a powerful run at the right end. Win or lose the
Thousand, she may give Quintus some trouble in
the Q.T.C. Stradbroke, run at Ascot a week later.
As regards the Brisbane Cup, there are favorable
reports of the three-year-old Loyal Shepherd, a good
cut of a colt by Shepherd King—Lady Buddha.
Though not yet a proved stayer, he is an effortless
galloper, and game. The St. Leger will show
whether he can get a distance, albeit his Cup chance
with Gst.. 101 b less than To Kara’s burden —
will be brighter if he escapes a penalty for winning
the red ribbon. He is saddled up by Peter Berg-
strom, who. until he found training racehorses easier,
used to coax sugar-cane from the red soil at Childers.
“Lud” : That good horse Sail Toi (Queen’s
Birthday—Merry Wife) died in England recently at
the ripe age of 28. In his racing days lie earned
a pot of money for George Edwardes, manager of. the
Gaiety and Daly’s theatres, who got him as a
yearling for less than 200 guineas. Among the
big races he won were the -Jubilee Stakes, the Ascot
Stakes and the Lewes Handicap. But his best per-
formance was when, as a three-year-old with Bst.
lib. on his back, he was only beaten by a head in the
Manchester November Handicap by Lexicon, who
was three years older and carried 161 b. less. San
Toi was as great a success at the stud as he had
been during his turf career. He sired four winners
of the Cesarewitch —Yentoi, Fiz Yama, Sanctum
and Yutoi.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: A punting neighbor of mine
was telling me last night that he always backs
horses with seven letters in their names. He
started it with Chester, lie said, and then he men-
tioned Carbine, Wakeful. Windbag. Manfred and
about 20 other great performers. “Ole Famous,” be
went on, “was a good friend to me when he was
in the business ; made a lot of money on ole Famous.”
“But there are not seven letters in that name,” I
protested. “No?” he replied pityingly. “What about
this?” Then he spelt the name carefully—
F-a-i-m-o-u-s. That settled it.
If Vic. Chief Sec. Argyle can persuade
hi : colleagues to agree with him, he will bring in
a bill next session to confer on a Board the fixing
of race-meetings, which is now part of his job. He
dislikes this sort of patronage and the wire-pulling
(especially for country “picnic” meetings) that it
involves. Wire-pullers will not be disconcerted by
the proposed change. They would just as soon try
to work a majority of a Board as the Minister on
his own, or seven out of twelve Cabineteers.
HARRY LEWIS, Adelaide racehorse-owner.
The first Australasian polo tournament
opened at Kensington (N.S.W.) racecourse on Satur-
day, when the Maorilanders were decisively beaten,
15 —3, by the N. S. Wales “A” side. Conditions
were villainous, the ground, not a bowling green
at the best of times, cutting up so badly that the
second match between Victoria and N.S.W. “B”
had to be postponed. The Maorilanders were outhit
and outridden from the start, the local ponies prov-
ing too nippy altogether for the tats from over the
Tasman. To do the visitors justice, the mud and
the cut-up ground were against them, for they
play in summer in the Dominion, and on exceptional
turf; and their No. 2, O. Nelson, the scoring man
of the side, was so shaken by a spill that he had to
go off. C. F. Mackenzie, the heavyweight back,
was the personification of steadiness, and his stick
work was in contrast to that of his mates. The
N.S.W. game was largely J. F. White, of Glen Innes.
Excellently mounted, the ex-Light Horseman rode
like a scared devil and the power and cleanness of
his hitting were worth getting wet to see. A.
McLaurin, from Harden, was a brilliant No. 1,
and gave White many opportunities. W. F. and
J. F. ltoss, also of Harden, played in capital fashion
further back, getting the ball forward to the attack
with great accuracy; and here, again, the hitting
was uncommonly good, for the ball was often half-
buried, and stick-grips greasy with mud and lain.
Conditions overhead and underfoot were much better
for Monday’s games, in the first of which Victoria,
splendidly mounted and combined, played all over
the N.S.W. “B” team, winning by 11> to 3. J. C.
Manifold, at No. 3, and W. li. Gumming, at back,
were the most conspicuous of a quartette which
worked perfectly together. The N.S.W. side was
rugged, with A. Davies, its No. 3, the most
prominent. The South Australians took their game
with Queensland by 8 to 5, but it was a ding-dong
go, both sides going at it hammer and tongs in an
exceptionally fast, hard-hitting match. Near the
close, S.A. regained combination, and proved too
solid for the Northerners, who are the Peton
(Darling Downs) club team, and have had few
games together this year. J. Dalton played a great
defensive game at back for Queensland, and later
did brilliant work at No. 3, R. Armstrong going
back, but the Queensland advance guard was not
as well served as it might have been. Law-Smith,
S.A.’s No. 2, was well fed and gave an impressive
display of goal-hitting. Victoria and the N.S.W. “A”
team will probably fight out the final of the Aus-
tralasian Cup on Saturday, and the writer likes Vic-
toria’s chance.
* * * *
“H. Hardupp”: The fallacy of the “too-
old-at-40” superstition,
even in such a young
man’s game as foot-
racing, was demon-
strated in the Kerang
(Vic.) Gift. Albert
Biggs was virtually
scratch man in the
final, and in spite of
his 42 years he proved
too fast for the young
fellows. Biggs has
been a ped. for 23
years, and has won all
sorts of prizes.
KEN AUSTIN,

to the N. S. Wales
Polo Association,
did a great deal

the Australasian
tournament.
‘‘Nitric'’: At the Brisbane Uni. athletic
meeting, J. Harrison, of St. John’s, collected the
championship cup with four firsts—the 100yds.
(10 4-ssec.), the broad jump (20ft. 9Mn.), the
880yds. (2min. lOsec.), and the 440yds.' (53see.).
St. John’s won the inter-college competition. The
inter-’Varsity meeting, which includes athletics, row-
mg and tennis, is to be held in Brisbane this year.
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide will be represented
for certain, and Perth is considering the matter.
“O. McKay M.”: Cussen of Newman brought off
a fine coup by winning the 100, 220 and 440 yards
championships of Melbourne Uni. Considering the
soft, uncertain state of the tracks, his times —
10 3-ssec., 23 2-ssec\, 54 4-ssec.—were capital.
T. B. Dodds, State field-sports champion and six
times athletics blue, as usual won the hammer-throw
(112 ft. 5Mn.) and the shot-put (36ft. Clin.).
Another stout effort was Nichterlein’s—he won the
mile and the 880. Melbourne expects to give a
good account of itself at the inter-’Varsity meeting.
* * * *
“Y4R”: Brisbane lias had a liead-of-tlie-
river race, too. It resulted in a fine win for
Brisbane High School, the lightest of the five crews,
which led nearly all the way. Like Sydney High
(B. 30/4/’25), Brisbane High had some trouble in
getting admitted to the competition because it is
a Government school. Like the Sydney institution
also, the school is lacking in sporting facilities;
it has neither football nor cricket ground, neither
boats nor shed. In this last respect the Brisbane
R.C. came to the rescue, and its members were as
pleased as Punch at the boys’ success.

De Leon, the Sydney Stadium’s Filipino
“champion,” stopped a featherweight named New-
bury in ten rounds on Saturday night. So far he
has only beaten third-raters and a back-number, but
there is no mention of a return fight with Congress
or a match with Grime. “Champions” ar e tender
plants.

An old enemy overcame Clarence Weber
(I3st. 101 b.) in the sixth round of his wrestling
bout with Limutkin (Isst.), after he had shown
that the huge Finn was no match for him. Sur-
prisingly alert and active, considering his vears,
Weber dumped the big man about like a slaughter-
man’s carter showing what he could do with massive
sides of beef, and in the third session he forced a
fall with a toehold. In the sixth, however, Limutkin
applied a body scissors which Weber might easily
have eluded, but the pressure restarted an old rib
injury which paralysed him. Weber gasped an
appeal for a cessation, and as he was unable to
continue, the hand of the referee had to fall with
the blessing of victory on the head of Limutkin.
“Gan" : The wrestling boom in Melbourne
evoked the wrath of the Presbyterian Assembly,
which “deprecated” such manoeuvres as head-locks and
toe-holds, scissors and half-nelsons. But a visiting
grappler assures me that wrestling is ciuite a nice
game. Even a Karasick head-hold is a gentle
thing. A man may turn a bit blue under it, and
his circulation may stop, but, the athlete explains,
it’s “just like going off to sleep.” It’s a grand
healthy sport (the world’s champion, Zbysko, is 56),
but a man should be trained for it. He requires a
special muscular development. One aspirant got his
neck broken at his debut, but it was his own fault
He wasn’t properly trained.
The English Soccer players won their two
games in Adelaide. South Australia was chewed up
by 10 goals to nil. but the match against “An'’
Australian XI (five South Australians, two West-
ralians and two each from Vic. and the Speck) was
not so one-sided, the visitors getting 4 goals to 1
(a penalty). The Aussies defended stoutly and
showed well in attack in the second half, but the
invaders’ fine combination and ball-control were too
much for them. Elkes is a wizard with the ball
at foot, and some of his mates are nearly his
equals, while the shooting at goal was a revela-
tion to Perth and Adelaide supporters of the round-
ball code.
“Adelaide”: The English Soccer team, though it
may not be absolutely England’s best, looks like
being good enough for the work before it. It had
the misfortune to cripple the opposing goalkeeper
in Adelaide, as in Perth, yet its methods are not
unduly strenuous. Rather does it rely on subtle
touches, giving a 15-yard pass as reliably as if from
hand to hand, instead of from foot to foot, and
often with the same ease as if no opponents were
in the neighborhood. The back division has run no
risks so far, except that of catching cold while
waiting about; but the forwards are delightful.
Also they use their heads, in both senses of the
term. Their first Adelaide match was played cn the
Oval; but the League, playing Australian rules, did
not see its way to offer the central ground to a
rival lot for Saturday, so the second tussle was
pushed out to suburban Thebarton.
* * * *
On Saturday a 40,000 crowd, too large for
the ground, collected at Essendon to see if Footscray
could repeat its last season’s feat of trouncing the
League premiers. ’Scray started well with a goal,
but before it got the second Essendon bad piled on
nine, and thereafter all interest faded out, save
when some half-baked barrackers got busy handing
out stoush to each other. ’Scray’s marking was poor
and its system inferior, whereas the ’Dons are sure
and clever, and their nippy little forwards, Irwin,
Shorten, Watt and Hardy, simply did what they
liked. ’Don won by 111 points to 63. Fitzroy
and the Richmond Tigers put up a great scuffle
till about lemon-time:—3 points was the difference
then —when a barrackers’ argument, settled in the
usual manner, spread itself over the ground and
stopped play until one party had had enough. After
that ’Roy bossed the show—ll 3 points to 59. The
great Moriarty booted nine goals. Hawthorn, bv
dint of good marking and unusual speed, held
follingwood level till three-quarter-time, but the
’Woodsmen were seasoned and better trained; they
won by 82 to 65. Melbourne trod on Carlton with
84 points to 38: Geelong outed St. Kilda by 62
to 30, and South Melbourne downed North with
82 to 61.
“G. 0.8.”; In Fitzroy’s greatest day, when such
champions as Percy Trotter, “Boxer” Milne, “Tich”
Bailes, the elder Moriarty and Jim Sharne helped it
to premierships, the captain and goal-getter was
Gerry Brosnan. He was a real all-rounder who in
summer bowled a deadly slow ball and made heaps
of runs. But above all he was a dinkum sport, and
he has just proved that he retains this quality. The
selling of the Evening Sun made no difference to
Brosnan’s position ; he was still kept on as foothill
expert cn the Sun Pictorial. But as journalism
was not his whole living, he promptly resigned in
favor of one of his less fortunate colleagues.

“Gan”: The only flaw in the Australian
game of football, which is far more brilliant and
spectacular than Rugby or Soccer, is the difficulty
of interpreting the rules. There is seldom any
doubt in Soccer wliat is a free kick or not. but in
our great game it is usually a subject of heated
debate. And in my judgment, the new out-of-bounds
rule has made little difference. The umpire has still
more difficult problems to solve than ever came
before the High Court. His decision is only right
or wrong according to the side you barrack for.
Throughout every match there are protests, abusive
language, hoots, yells and derisive cheers. “Worse
than the police! ” cries an overwrought barraeker.
“I don’t mind him making mistakes,” a quiet man
observes, “but they’re all on the one side”—the other
side, of course. “Did you see that ?” A strong
man turns white with emotion. “What’s that for?
It should have been the other way.” Then he
grasps the pickets fiercely in his wrath. “Murder!”
hp mutters, and then breaks into a loud but hollow
laugh.
* * * *
Perhaps because it was a dirty day there
was some dirty work in the South Sydney-Eastern
Suburbs match on the Sydney Cricket Ground, and
referee McMahon sent two men—one from each side
—off the field. South was much the stronger team
and won by 14 to nil, Wearing (a real discovery as
a goal-kicker) contributing four goals. St. George,
on the new ground at Arncliffe, downed Western
Suburbs, previously unbeaten, by 6 to 5. West’s
fast backs were handicapped by the slush and the
sodden ball. Balmain defeated University by 8
to 2, and Glebe had a picnic against Newtown—
-10 to nil. The attendances at all the games were
nearly equal to the crowd at an unimportant Aus-
tralian League match in Melbourne:
* * * *
In a strenuous same played in the mud
at Ipswich (Q.), Toowoomba broke even with the
local side —a try each. Canles. from N. S. Wales,
was a tower of strength to the Ipswich XIII, who did
most of the attacking and were pressing strongly at
the final whistle.
“Nitric”: Duncan Thompson (B. 30/4/’25)
clayed Union Rugby in Warwick (Q.) in 1911 and
in battalion games in France. In 1915 he played
inter-State as half-back to Hodges, the five-eighth,
who was an old Australian and Queensland Union
rep. Thompson was then in Ipswich, the home of
Queensland League, and he was only kept out of
the “half” possie hr Yunto Lewis, for years a
representative half-back. It was Ipswich that held
up Wagstaffe’s English team in 1914 until the last
few minutes ; then the Englishmen unwound those com-
bined forward and “threes” passing rushes that made
the team famous.
“Centurion”: After all, the Maoriland
selectors decided to leave members of the last All
Blacks but of the side which will leave for Sydney
on June 5, after playing a game at Wellington on
June 3. Among the selected lot are Donald,
the snowy-haired winger, who was over here in
1920 and 1922. J. Bell and L. Righton. who ulayed
for M.L. against the N.S.W. touring side in 1923.
SCIENCE TO THE RESCUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Science and horseraeing (says the Sydney Sun)
were once poles apart, but they are gradually
becoming allied. Science is likely to confer untold
benefits on the turf.”
A halcyon time is heralded —confess it —
Science and racing toddling hand in hand,
Or racing neck-to-neek might better express it,
Amid the plaudits of a crowded stand.
Before a foot is settled in the stirrup
The steeds that to unruliness incline
Will get a pint apiece of soothing syrup
That none may break the line.
There’ll be no equine cripples to be slated,
No gees gone wrong to founder or to roar,
And ancient prads, with glands rejuvenated,
Will hit the track for fifty years or more.
No trainer in the epoch coming, I’ve a
Notion, will give his charge forbidden juice,
Knowing analysis of the saliva
Would promptly cook his goose.
And when a down the st raight the leaders tussle,
No jock, will ever dare to pull his mount;
A register installed upon his muscle
Each ounce of check upon the reins will count.
No more the harassed punter’s eyes will harden
At swindles palpable and ramps that irk.
Won't everything be lovely in the garden
When Science gets to work!
Books of their odds no more will be assessors
And prey unhindered on the hapless mob;
A board of mathematical professors
Will obviously be assigned the job,
And docile Mo will holler as instructed
With all his old initiative, banned.
Ah ! won’t the turf be differently conducted
When Science takes a hand ?

"So you like my new coal?” "/ do, indeed! Jlnd it is so much more effective
because the Stockings are such a beautiful match. *
Hosier? in
Nextf Marie and Heather Hues
pASHION has set its seal on Marie and Heather colorings for this
Autumn and Winter, and the woman who obeys fashion’s dictates needs
must have Hosiery in absolute harmony with the new colorings in order
to complete a perfect tout ensemble. Naturally, she turns to Bond s Stjlkenwooi Hose, and
for two very definite reasons, finds that it completely meets her needs.
" Stf'kenwoof” Hosiery is knitted from Silk and Wool in a range of color-blends that harmonize
perfectly with practically any Marie or Heather mixture. T. he combination of Silk and W 00l
means that the attractiveness of silk is retained whilst there is added the cold weather com-
fort to be derived from the wearing of wool.
In common with all Bond’s Hosiery r 'S:jtkeniooc l” gives that snug fit that good dressing demands, due not
only to the fine texture of the stocking itself, but also to the correct lines on which Bonds Hosiery
is fashioned. €fl There’s a new pleasure awaiting you —the two-fold enjoyment of comfort and distinction.

The Commonwealth Literary Fund used to pay a
small allowance to Mrs. Kendall, the widow of the
poet. She died a few months ago, but it has been
decided to continue the allowance to a daughter.
Amongst the correspondence from a country repre-
sentative received by a Queensland sub-editor
recently was the statement that the subject of the
paragraph “was the father of approximately 12
children.”
Franklin Peterson, formerly of the Argus, and fora
while a bright writer in “The Passing Show” column,
caught the eye of Northcliffe, and so got a good start
on the Times. Now he has been appointed news editor
of the Thunderer’s Dominions an . rorugn department.
“The Deacon”; It seems likely that at the end
of his trip abroad Rev. Dr. Sheehy will not return
to his post on the Catholic Press (Sydney). Previ-
ously in important professorial (hairs in the Car-
dinal’s College at Manly, a post will probably be
found for him in All Hallows’, the great Irish factory
for missionaries, where most of Australia’s im-
ported priests are made.
“Alwyn”; Mention of 95-year-old Queanbeyan news-
paper man John Gale (B. 7/5/’25) recalls that in
his youth the veteran was addicted to poetry and
published a small volume of verse in England.
Among the debris of the Dunbar wreck washed
ashore at South Head, in August, 1857, was a
copy of this little book. The author afterwards
recovered it and possibly still has it.
A rare distinction was accorded to Henry Curwen
on leaving the Launceston Examiner reporting staff
to join the Age this month. The City Council passed
a resolution commending his work in reporting
its proceedings. Curwen won the envy of fellow
pressmen some th.ee years ago for his scoop an
nouncing the appointment of F. M. N icholl as the
first city manager in Australia. He has been on
the Inky Way for 15 years, eight of them with the
Examiner.
“C.C.”; The long-service record for an Australian
roundsman is surely held by P. J. Bennett, who
last month completed 35 years’ work in this capacity
for Melbourne Herald. He has been in close touch
with every Victorian Ministry that has held office
during that period, and is still as keen on his job
as ever. A past general president of the A.J.A.,
and a vice-president these last five years, Bennett
has been awarded the gold badge of the order for
his services.
Gone where all good printers go, Edgar Hand-
sombody, for 30-odd years overseer at McCarron, Bird
and Co.’s office, Collins-street (Melb.). “Body,” as
the hundreds of apprentices who have passed througn
his hands affectionately called him, was of the quiet,
plodding, sincere type of English-trained tradesmen,
and his death will cause a pang of regret in manv
printing offices. H. R. Pottage, 8.A., one of
“Body’s” old boys, takes the gentle, kindly old soul's
place in the office.
“Quiz”; Cecil Mann and I used to discuss verse
and versemaking by letter, when he was in the
infantry and lin the artillery in France. The letters
were, of course, censored. One day my Major sent
for me to attend on him at his dug-out, looked me
over with a caught-with-tlie-goods expression, and
invited me to confess that I was carrying on a
system of code messages with one Mann, of the
infantry. As proof he produced a letter of mine,
posted that morning to Mann, giving my ideas on
a certain piece of verse. He had underscored words
like “anacrusis,” “monometer,” “tribrach,” “spondee,”
“elegiac,” “distich,” etc., that were liberally scattered
through the pages. When I explained that they
were verse terminology, he naively assured me that
he had not for a moment suspected me of treacherv.
but even friendly coding was forbidden.
“Miss C. Laneous” meditates on a column in an
Adelaide morning paper (13/4/’25) :
I don’t know why they mix up catarrh and rub-
ber-stamp advertisements with the matrimonial. Not
that’s its very matrimonial these days; only one
gent, requires a wife, and he’s not very encouraging:
“Laborer, 24 (Britisher), tall, respectable, quiet,
only means £4 2s. per week, wants a quiet wife at
once. Apply, sending photographs, to “Ardent
Lover.”
“Ardent Lover,” indeed—on £4 2s. a week. O’
course, if a girl is looking for a “good time” and
no questions asked, she can ’ave it:—
“Gent., on holiday, wishes meet Lady Companion,
few nights this week. , this office.”
“Young Man (27), tall, dark, smart appearance,
like to meet young lady, outings. , .”
“Two Chaps from country like meet two girls
(24), same age as chaps. ,
Finally:—
“Young Man (35), own car, desires friendship of
quietly-dressed, healthy Girl or Woman; must be
good class, well educated, and not thin. Write ,
Gee, that’s me! I’ll see him!
“D.D.D.” : Douglas Brooke Wheelton Sladen, 8.A.,
LL.B., now in his 70th year, has published a new
work of fiction ir. England. Sladen’s connection with
Australian literature is an amazing memory for
those who can hark back about 30 years and remem-
"ber his “Condensed Milk” poem. He took charge
of all our poets, with a special proprietary interest
in Adam Lindsay Gordon, whom he claimed as a
Cheltenham College boy, like himself. In “Fair
Inez,” Sladen’s weird novel dealing with Australia
in a.d. 2000, the Gordons actually come to sit on
the English throne. Sladen made Kendall “the
Australian Shelley,” Ileney “the Australian Walt
Whitman,” “Arthur Patchett Martin “the Australian
R.L.5.,” Agnes Neale “the Australian A. A. Proctor,”
Gordon “the Australian Burns,” and so on. There
is hardly a branch of literature which Sladen has not
assaulted with dubious success.
’’B-N.”: The stories that various interested parties
tell don’t agree in all respects, but this looks the
most like the one the others ought to agree with.
Melbourne Sun Co. was doing quite well with the
Morning Pictorial, which was showing a profit of
a few hundreds a week. The Evening Sun was,
however, still a heavy loser, and it didn’t look as if
it could be made a payable proposition for less
than another £150,000 or £200,000 ; and by that
time the co. would have such a capital that a fat
retfirn was unlikely for many years. The Herald
was still paying handsomely; but the competition
was keeping its advertising rates down. The price
it paid to get hold of the profitable morning paper
and to get rid of the p.m. competitor is said to
have been £175,000; and it will, besides con-
tribute £13,000 a year for 10 years to the ’Sun’s
cable service. For this nice, fat wad it gets
nothing but the goodwill of the morning paper and
various contracts —no real property or plant. Most
of the plant will be shifted to Sydney and Newcastle
for sale to and use by the parent co. The latter
will have a good deal of cash to handle; what it
will do with it has not yet been settled, though
various people are hard at work thinking out schemes.
“Morehead”: Eleven of the nearly 300 candidates
seeking seats in the N.S.W. Assembly describe them-
selves as journalists. Of the sitting members seek-
ing re-election who claim to walk the Inky Way, ex-
Minister of Education Tom Mutch was once on the
staff of the Worker ; J. C. L. Fitzpatrick has edited
the Daily Argus at Goulburn; Walter Bennett was
once editor and proprietor of the Dungog Chronicle ;
and R. S. Vincent ran a sheet at Dorrigo, now in
the hands of his brother. There is nothing to show
what moved J. G. D. Arkins, M.L.A. for St.
George, who does something in the way of piano-
teaching by correspondence, to include himself under
the heading. W. T. Ely, a Laborite who represented
Parramatta during the term of the last Labor
Government, still keeps the local populace informed
of their neighbors’ doings by means of the Cumber-
land Times. Of the others, Crawford Vaughan,
ex-S’tralian Premier and Progressive candidate for
Ryde, was connected with the weekly Quiz in Adel-
aide 20 years ago, and still does some freelancing,
mostly in connection with cotton. W. H. Pinkstone,
who is . courting Holman’s old electorate as a
Nationalist publishes the Cootamundra Herald ;
J. W. Niesigh, another Fullerite who is out for
Murray, wields the blue pencil on the Wagga Express;
but the credentials of F. W. Armstrong, Protestant
Labor (Western Suburbs), and F. W. Marks, Inde-
pendent (Eastern Suburbs), are obscure.


What Labor Men Say
About Their Own Party
These statements have been selected from
the deliberate public utterances of well-known
Labor Men.
They have not been refuted and are capable
of only one meaning.
*‘The Parliamentary leaders and other parties were shouting
‘We want a clean movement,’ but when the acid test was put on
them they squibbcd the issue. They knew that very few of them
could come out of the ordeal with a clean sheet. They knew that
they had been selected by crook, corrupt methods, and to undergo
a searching investigation into the matter was beyond them.”
—Extract from, the report of the Labor Council of N.S.W. for year ended
December 31, 19'21}, and referring to the A.L.P. Conference of 1921}.
¥ y $
“What has the Labor movement descended to when it allows
itself to be permeated by gutter politics? At the present time, in
some country districts, practically illiterate people or those with little
or no influence or stake in the electorate control the branch. They
are usually the puppets of some tricky Parliamentary failure.”
—Extract from the Coonamble Independent {Labor) of April 3, 1925, whose
editor was expelled from the Labor movement for publishing matter not approved,
of by the local Labor Committee.
* H- ¥ H-
He said that his experience of thirty years of politics had
convinced him that most selection ballots were corrupt. Matters
never went straight with selection ballots, he added.
— -INewspaper report of evidence given by Mr. P. J. Minahan, M.L.A., at Mr.
Theodore’s inquiry, 'November 11, 1921}.
H- * H- *
“Hatred was a poison, because where it operated reason
became warped. Unfortunately hatred permeated the Labor move-
ment to-day. . . .The Labor movement needed higher ethical ideals,
otherwise it might prove a curse rather than a blessing.”
— Mr. A. C. Willis, President of the A.L.P.
¥ # * H- H-
“We publicly charge the A.L.P. Executive with corruptly using
its position as custodian of the A.L.P. rules in the interests of a few
self-seekers to the detriment of the whole working-class movement.”
—Resolution by Trades and Labor Council, Sydney, August, 1921}.
Mr. Gregory McGirr: “We have men in this House who pose as
Labor men who receive money to keep the worker down.”
An Hon. Member: “From whom do they receive it?”
Mr. Gregory McGirr: “From brewers, bookmakers and others.”
— Hansard, December 5, 1923.
* * ¥ * *
A select committee of the A.L.P., reporting in 1922 on an
appointment made to the Legislative Council by Mr. Dooley, then
Premier, said: “We are forced to concur in the belief that Mr.
Dooley was well aware of all the circumstances surrounding this
corrupt appointment.”
Mr. Dooley, in his reply, said: “The movement cannot
function if it is to be torn week by week by the selfish intrigues of
uncouth crooks and their hangers-on.” And: “The movement cannot
live if the gutters of the city are to be raked for creatures to fake
charges against the party’s leader, as has been done.”
The A.L.P., in deciding to expel Mr. Dooley, referred on
March 1 to “the periodical revelation of unsavory political trans-
actions.”
In a speech at Lithgow, on March 7, Mr. Dooley spoke of
“those who lived on the movement by their crooked tactics,” and
added: “They could not get into politics by their own merits—only
by scheming and trickery, by faked ballots, and so on.”
* * v- v- *
The ballot-box or pre-selection scandals are endless.
The Cootamundra pre-selection ballot had to be declared
void because the fakers had been at work.
Mr. Jock Garden, speaking in the Domain on April 27, 1924,
referred by name to two members of the P.L.L. who “engaged in
illegal practices in connection with the Newtown pre-selection
ballot.”
A committee inquiring into certain matters in the King branch
of Sydney electorate was forced to take control and stop the ballot.
Mr. Last (A.W.U.) publicly denounced a “Credentials Com-
mittee” as “the most astute manipulators and super-tricksters.”
Mr. E. C. O’Dea, giving evidence before the Theodore inquiry,
said: “I have never in my life seen so much roguery as took place
in the Sydney selection ballot of 1920.”
* * * * *
“There is just as much crooked business going on among
A.L.P. branch members in pre-selection ballots as there is among
the unions.”
— Mr. W. E. Corbin, vice-president of the Newtoicn-Erskineville branch of the
A.L.P.
* # * * *
All attempts to eradicate dishonesty in selection ballots have
failed.... In many cases honest men have become nauseated and
have refrained from offering themselves for selection. Thereupon
the great privilege has been left to the rank and file of deciding, in
the choice phrase of Stephen Leacock, which of the crooks is the
crookedest?’
— Mr. J. F. Higgins, M.L.C.

The “Kreutzer Sonata” and the Cesar
Franck “Sonata in A” were the outstanding
offerings of the Kreisler concerts in Sydney
for the week. These two works give the violin-
ist and the pianist a chance to show the per-
fect balance of their ensemble work; and
their rendering of the Cesar Franck number
held their matinee audience last Friday
tense with something very like awe. The
work is at once vital, brilliant and modern,
and all the strength and vivid tints of the
composition bowed out in waves of sound,
dizzying in their sheer beauty and remark-
able for freshness of interpretation. Never
has Kreisler's violin sounded more golden
or more dramatic, and certainly this per-
formance registered Lamson’s high-water
mark of the season at the piano. The
widely-known “Kreutzer” had to appear on
three successive programmes, so insistent
was the demand for it. The imagery, the
cobweb lightness and the warmth of Beetho-
ven’s In Memoriam to his hopeless love won
even those listeners not already predisposed
for sentimental reasons in the “Kreutzer’s”
favor. A Vivaldi concerto, luminous with
tears, and that laughing cavalier of the bow,
Lalo’s “Symphonic Espagnole,” were other
outstanding numbers in a musically memor-
able week. Old favorites such as the Dvorak-
Kreisler Negro Sniritual melody. Kreisler’s
own Viennese waltzes, and the Song of the
Volga Boatmen have been among the peren-
nial encores; and works from the pens of
Grieg, Viotti and Mozart have bowered on
some of the most enthusiastically received
programmes ever given in Sydney.

At Sydney Criterion Maurice Moscovitcli is
still endeavoring to live up, by voice and
gesture, to the press advts. that bespeak him
“the greatest actor of Shylock that the world
has seen.” It is a big claim and unlikely to
be settled until Conan Doyle or somebody
can get hold of Shakspeare on the astral
’phone.

Majesty’s for the 50th time on Monday
night. They look good for another 50 with-
out half-soling.
Gregan McMahon's Repertorians gave
an almost brilliant rendering of Somerset
Maugham’s comedy, “The Circle,” last Satur-
day night at Sydney Oonservatorium. The
play is a three-acter in the playwright’s most
analytical manner, and the company served
the dialogue in just the right souffle method.
Annie Hughes portrayed Lady Kitty, the
principal character, and her work .was more
than good-—here and there it flashed with
insight. Gregan McMahon, as the original
deserted husband, was in his best mood ; and
other outstanders were Winifred Heath
Green as Elizabeth and S. R. Irving as Lord
Porteous, the constant if not perfect lover.

The jazz band at Kydney tenners’ is a
decided improvement on all the orchestras
that have drifted into this house during the
past 12 months ; these last-comers are melody-
makers who can actually discriminate between
a crotchet and a semi-quaver. There is also on
view an ambidextrous ealigraphist, who
would make an ideal booky’s clerk during the
rush hours; and George Wallace’s revue,
“A Dancing Delirium,” is an amusing slice
of burlesque.

Will Fyffe knocked a hole in his erstwhile
good reputation at. Sydney Tivoli when lie
fell to the temptation to enter the realms
of pathos. As a sniffling juvenile who is a
wearisome case of arrested development the
otherwise entertaining comedian bored his
listeners, and if it had not been for tin*
highly diverting drunk turn that followed he
would have never regained the ground he
lost. Felovis, a juggler from Europe, is an
artist of startling dexterity and originality,
and the act where he introduces three burn-
ing torches as a novelty keeps everyone
on the alert.. Tom Clare continues to gently
tap out quiet little monologues at the piano.
Others on the present bill are generally
better than average.
“The Girl on the Stairs,” at Sydney Lyric
—not the blonde who takes your tickets, but
Patsy Ruth Miller—is cured of sleepwalking
by a psycho-analyst, and nearly spoils her
young life by having too many irons in the
fire. Blasco Ibanez is said to have written
“Argentine Love,” upon which the Empress
is resting its hopes. The story and char-
acters seem curiously subordinated to the
scenery, which, as in all pictures off the
beaten track, takes a prominent part. “Thy
Name is Woman,” at Hoyt’s, puts a feather in
the cap of producer Fred Niblo. It is taken
from the play by Karl Schoenherr, and fol-
lows accurately every detail of the original
in a manner seldom seen in the movies. The
acting and sub-titles are also an improve-
ment on the general run of “adaptations.”
“The Spoilers,” by Rex Beach, has been
done before in the silent drama, but the pre-
sent version—at the Lyceum—is a little more
elaborate and spun out. The Prince Edward
is still giving wide publicity to the decalogue
as expounded by Theodore Roberts, and Lon
Chaney is an almost respectable “Hunchback
of Notre Dame,” at the Crystal Palace.

One of the Old Guard on parade:—
Henry Fullwood’s show at the Australian Fine
Art Galleries, Sydney, is good pictorial stuff, full
of interest and variety. Few have painted the
Australian summer landscape better than he has
in No. 8, “Murrurundi Valley, N.S.W.”; and there is
character in the little roadside incident in No.
103; and his European studies are rich in poetry.
There is work here in five mediums, and perhaps
the lithographs are the strongest. Nos. 100 and
101 are studies of the Thames drawn with vigor
and imagination. The National Gallery has written
its name on half a dozen.
** * *
Sydney sees something :
A Maorilander, Sydney Thompson, has unpacked
at the Macquarie Galleries, Bligh-street, the best
one-man show the Harbor City has seen this season.
He comes from many years’ residence overseas with
the laurels of numerous salons and musees thick
upon his brow, and recently dazzled his compatriots
across the Tasman Sea so that they opened their
purses to an unprecedented degree. Slick brush-
work, clever composition and skilled handling of
figures is the recipe which he uses to convert mud-
pies into pictures, and a certain monotony of sub-
ject is relieved by a great variety of treatment.
No. 2, “Unloading Boats, Concarneau,” has been
bought by the N.S.W. National Gallery, and is an
example of his lively composition. The group of
fisherfolk in No. 12, “A September Day, Concar-
neau,” are startlingly alive, and tjje rendezvous in
No. 19 has a background of tempestuous trees con-
trasting vividly with the evening light resting on
quiet walls and the well-placed groups of squatting
talkers. The light shakes in No. 28, “Souk Ilam-
niamet,” where the artist has captured the tropical
atmosphere that eluded Will Ashton in a recent
show.

The color prejudices and hatreds of the
Southern States of Gahd’s Own Country
provide the theme for the dose of melodrama
which Guy Bates Post has induced Mel-
bourne to take in “The Nigger,” revived
after some years at the King’s. Philip
Morrow, descendant of a proud Southern
family, who is a “right-thinking” man about
niggers, makes a good sheriff, and is nomi-
nated as governor by a political machine which
"The Skin Game," at
Sydney Palace.
Muriel Starr as Chloe,
a professional co-
respondent.
is mainly concerned
in opposing pro-
nigger and anti-
liquor factions.
Having accepted
that nomination,
Morrow’s progress
in his love affair
with Georgiana
Bryd is interrupted
by a man-hunt for
a liquor-demented
buck nigger, .Toe
White, who has
criminally assaulted
a white girl—stage
effects of galloping
hoofs and the
hound-pack in full
cry on the trail of
the fugitive work
up the thrill. The
sheriff's attempt to
save the black for
the law-mill fails,
a squeal off stage
telling the tale
when the lynchers
lay hold of him;
but Morrow gets
the governorship in
spite of risking un-
popularity in de-
fending the dis-
colored man; and
the rest is a story
of the troubles
that beset him in
his rei g n, the
worst of them the discovery that he himself
is part nigger.
The silences which are a notable part o£
Guy Bates Post’s methods are over-used to
such an extent that they go perilously close
to producing boredom, in spite of the thrill
of the story. When not overworking these
silences, he is inclined to go to the other
extreme with hoarse explosiveness. It is
his least satisfactory characterisation in Mel-
bourne. As the unmoral, uncouth Clifton
Noyes, Winnington Barnes is responsible
for excellent work, and Gerald Pring is
specially good as a decrepit negro butler.
Gertrude Boswell deserves a special recall
at the end of the second act for her work
as an ancient quadroon who holds the key
of Morrow’s birth history; Nellie Mortyne
is a natural elderly lady, Mrs. Bryd, with
strong nigger antipathies, and Ailsa Grahame
can be forgiven for some shortcomings in a
not very attractive part.
“Spring Cleaning” doesn’t seem nearly
through yet at Melbourne Royal. Now
Lonsdale, the author, has written a sequel
wherein Steele, the extra man in the triangle
which includes Pauline Frederick, is married;
and audiences are asking whether there’s a
hope of seeing their new divinity in that
too.
In its life of Frith and bubble, “Primrose”
stands like stone at Melbourne Majesty’s.
On Saturday night Allan Wilkie said good-
bye to Melbourne in “The Merchant of
Venice.” During the last week of revivals
the business was more up to the company’s
deserts than usual. There have been some
new appearances, and Lorna Forbes, who
will be a fixture on the salary list when it
goes to Brisbane and Maoriland, made a very
good Maria in “Twelfth Night”—a perform-
ance improved also by the work of another
new member, Arthur Keane, as Fabian.
Dulcie Cherry, a sweet-voiced addition, with
(so far) an amateurish touch in her acting,
made a nice singing fairy in “Mid-
summer Night’s Dream”; and a performance
of “Romeo and Juliet” was notable for the
improvement in the work of Claude Saunders,
who, an ideal Romeo in appearance, infused
more fire into the part than on the previous
occasion when this Showman viewed him.
“Snap,” which Howett Worster and Kitty
Reidy will introduce to Melbourne New
Palace on Saturday, after the ghosts of
Shakspeare have been hunted out, has been
heralded by advertisement in verse. Still it
is probably the worst thing about the show.
With “Little Jessie James” still twinkling
her merry legs at the New Princess’s, in Mel-
bourne, the management finds itself married
to Fortune, and the Dot is most satisfactory.
* * *
“On Our Selection” is to bring Australian
atmosphere to Melbourne King’s on Saturday
week, when the season of Guy Bates Post
will have ended. The popularity of Bert
Bailey’s money-spinner is unending.
“Skittles” will resign on Friday night, and
on Saturday the same old J. D. O’Hara will
say “Thank U” at Melbourne Athenaeum
and keep on saying it for some weeks—Lee
White is not due until July 4. This Showman
hopes there is some mysterious significance
attached to the abbreviation of the title.
It would be horrible to think that that sort
of thing was supposed to be humorous.
The Sistine Soloists, who have met hn
unexplainable cold wind in Melbourne,
changed their programme twice last week,
and this week are trying to warm the atmo-
sphere with nightly changes. Burani is
outstanding amongst the nine performers,
and the stately use to which he put his great
voice in the King’s Lament from "Ernani"
was the chief item in the first programme
change last week. Giuseppe Paganelli and
Sarti are excellent, the latter especially so
in the Flower Song from “Carmen.” But
Facchini mislaid several notes in singing
“Salve Regina,” from “Faust,” and his exag-
geration of its sentiments was grotesque. The
programme is usually of a high standard, and
a better appreciation might be expected from
Melbourne.
** * *
Edward Goll drew music-lovers to the
Melba Ilall when lie introduced to Mel-
bourne Busoni’s “Fantasia in modo antieo”
—finely played but lacking originality.
Better was the “Tema con variazioni” of
Emil Blanchet, Avitli its piquant harmonies
and forcible rhythms and the solemn bass
thirds brought in with surprising effect.
After the pianist’s success in this, his failure
to express the full fragrance of Haydn's
“Sonata in D Major” was a disappointment.
It was tame work. There is to be another
recital by the same performer (the fifth of
a series under the direction of the Ormond
Professor of Music, W. A. Laver) on the
28th at the Assembly Hall.
The disciples of Ibsen who filled the Mel-
bourne Queen’s Tlall on Monday heard again
the tragedy of Nora, the puppet wife in “The
Doll’s House,” who, when she wakens to
life’s realities, shows a keener capacity for
realisation than her convention-ridden hus-
band. The performance showed signs of
having been well rehearsed, but large and
painful patches of amateurism betrayed
themselves. Lucy Ahon gave a very fair
presentation of the dollar wife, but quite
failed to lift the unbelievably stiff Torvald
Ilelmer, as played by Bruce Henderson, with
her in her airier flights. Beresford Fowler,
except for one amazing loss of lines, was
good as Nils Ivrogstad, and Beatrice Ternan
also succeeded as Mrs. Linde; but the Dr.
Rank of W. E. Pye would have been better
if he had shown less tendency to make the
part a jig.
** * *
Wee Gcorgie Wood, following an excellent
practice of making weekly changes, intro-
duced “Nobody Loves Me” to Melbourne
Tivoli last Saturday. The sketch ranks with
the midget’s best portrayals of the moods
of kidhood. Clement May is back with
Dickens sketches, worked for all their melo-
dramatic worth, which gives him a pull with
audiences before whom artists .with more
restraint have failed. “The Versatile Three”
fill a big space in a programme which is
otherwise normal.
THE SYDNEY REPERTORY THEATRE
SOCIETY IN “THE CIRCLE."
Teddy Luton (Geoffrey Heigh) and Clive
Champion-Cheney (Gregan McMahon)

June Mills, the plump lady who made
comedy as one of the ugly sisters in the
“Cinderella” panto., good-naturedly bills her
self as “The World’s Fattest Flapper” at the
Melbourne Bijou. Her sketch is “A Ton of
Fun,” and the lady does her best to give
the audience full weight for its money. Stiffy
and Mo have enlisted, and the army they
get into is almost as humorous as the A.I.F.
sometimes seemed.

The Oxford debating team has left the
bleeding corpse of Melbourne University
oratory on the doorstep and passed on to
Adelaide. The Melbourne men —Smith,
Pratt and Mulvaney—turned out in evening-
dress splendor, but their speaking methods
were very crude compared with the polished
style and careful voice-modulation of the
visitors, who seemed unconcerned about their
doilies. Woodruff, with a wild mop of hair
worthy of a soapbox enthusiast, is a line
academic speaker, full of wit which he deli-
vers without descending from his pedestal;
but Malcolm Macdonald, because he is the
only one of the three who allows the fire of
conviction to carry him away, gets the most
attention. Tt is significant that the, only neon•
sion when the verdict of the adjudicators (and
the audience) can he said to have gone
against the visitors was in a “mixed debate”
on (Government control of industry, in whicli
Malcolm Macdonald and two of the Mel-
burnians opposed his two colleagues and one
Melbourne speaker. And in giving a deci-
sion in his favor, Dr. Barrett, the chief
adjudicator, was certainly not swayed by a
prejudice for the point of view the ex-
Prime Minister’s son advocated.
“The (Girl on the Stairs” introduces a sleep-
walking story with a well-sustained mystery
to Melbourne Majestic, where Percy Mar
mont shines also in “The Legend of Holly-
wood”—a picture with a special appeal to
movie “fans.” Hoyt’s de Luxe again con-
trives to get Pauline Frederick’s moving
photograph next door to Pauline Frederick
herself. The play is “Salvage.” said to be
the last of her picture work; but it is not
as good a screen story as its companion,
“The Tornado.” with the consistent House
Peters in the heavy part.
Sundry art effects :
The trustees of the Felton Art Bequest (Melb.j
made a descent upon the fine exhibition of'the work
of the late E. Phillips Fox on the first day of the
auction sale; but the only work they bought was a
rich portrait study of an old-fashioned lady, with char-
acter sweetly expressed and the old-style clothes
nicely worked, entitled “My Cousin.” The price
paid was 400 guineas, and the trustees got value.
The attendance was poor, and some bargains were
got at from £2 to £75 each.
At the Arts and Crafts display in the Capitol,
a collection of Chinese embroideries and Japanese
colored prints lent by Miss Hodgson make a show
in themselves. The work is most decorative. But
the main exhibit is the output of Australian craft
workers, and it shows the great advance we arc
making in the little embellishments of home decora-
tion. Jessies Traill’s designs for friezes and dadoes
struck a particularly happy note, and the metal
work of Miss Kit Turner deserves a mention. The
most notable thing, however, is the feeling of
loneliness that the visitor is liable to get as he
wanders among the treasures.
Fine acting is the main feature in Pinero’s
old “His House in Order” at Adelaide Royal.
The brilliant tragi-comedy brings home to
cme how much Pinero owed —naturally
enough, and very profitably to himself—to
the French school in general and Sardou in
particular. Boucicault puts amazing energy
into what is, after all, a standby and
advisory part; his success is a lesson jto all
young actors. In a cast of unusual matu-
rity. Mrs. Brough and Beatrice Day and
Ilallard give finished renderings. Irene Van-
brugh lives every phase of a tremendous
part. It is worth noting that the Ridgeley
family, made almost farcical in some London
presentations of the play, are here shown
with a quietness that is almost dignity, the
odd effect being that the heroine is made to
seem utterly in the wrong half the time—
as doubtless she was. A fine picture this
week is the vivid fighting “Sea Hawk.” at
the York, with business very big. Percy
Marmont is at Wondergrapli, looking sad. as
usual; and West’s adds to a sound bill a
quaint monkey orchestra. Also Adelaide is
doing full justice to Galli-Ourci. at the
Town Hall.
From an Adelaide critic:—
Then, Proctor’s show, ut the Society of Arts,
makes one sit up and take notice at every turn.
This is probably because of the Lambert influence,
which in some instances shrieks at you. In her
search for the quaint and arguable, she sometimes
goes further; is it fanciful to detect a Goya in-
fluence? She creates difficulties for the sake of
triumphing over them. Her extreme addiction to
mid-Victorian costume, and flip pork-pic hat in
particular, seems uncalled for; faces often have a
deathly pallor; and her mules arc not merely nude,
but are all too obviously undressed. Still, there
remains much to praise. The difficulties, wherever
they come from, generally are triumphed over. The
grouping of figures, especially in the fan designs, is
striking. And some of the larger water-colors of
a single figure have a breadth and simplicity that
is really attractive.

“Peter Piper”: The recent overdose of
“Kreutzer Sonata” which has been inflicted
on the crowds who have flocked to Sydney
Town Hall to hear Kreisler is the result of
an artist entering into a field quite foreign
to him. The popularity of the “Kreutzer”
ALL JOE MILLERS.
ARTIST: “Did you see the jokes I left this morning, sir?”
EDITOR: “I did — before you were born!”
is not due to any intrinsic merit the work
may possess, but to the legend woven around
it by Tolstoi, and, in a lesser degree, to the
recent film founded on that novel. That
Tolstoi was not only quite ignorant of the
technical side of music, but had no appre-
ciation for it even as a listener, is shown
by his absurd remarks regarding Wagner’s
music in his book. “What Is Art?”, Why
he should have chosen the "Kreutzer,” a
work almost entirely devoid of passion, on
which to base his rather erotic novel will
for ever remain a mystery. However, the
novel appears to have made the name of the
sonata familiar to the world at large, and
the result is that, whenever a famous violin-
ist appears, he is inundated with requests
for its performance. The requests generally
come from people only familiar with the
title, and who are quite unaware that the
work is for the most part badly balanced
and rather dull, the only bright spot being
the really, lovely theme and variations which
form the middle movement.
“C.K.” meets some fiddlers: —
During the lust two decades of the nineteenth
century it was my privilege to meet many of the
great violinists of that period, both publicly and
privately. By “privately” I mean two or three
of us and a piano. 1 was sufficiently a pianist to
be able to play whatever was necessary, and many
delightful afternoons 1 spent with cne or other of
the Masters. Ysaye, Sarasate and Papini were of the
number. Some compositions which have since become
famous were first exploited in that atmosphere.
What struck me most, both then and afterwards, was
that while in private the violinists were normal
artistic persons, on the platform they displayed
extravagance of manner which detracted from the
beauty of their performances. On being tackled,
they each of them- —one or two of them indignantly
- denied it, but it was there ail the same. John
Dunn, a native of my home town, who rose to
eminence, (hose to cloud his genius by being posi-
tively insulting to an audience. He would arrive
at the hall in his ordinary (generally shabby)
clothes, with dirty boots and unshaven chin, arid—
if lie was allowed to appear—play divinely. But
one night in Leeds—l was singing at the same
'concert -the manager would not allow him to per-
form unless lie changed into the orthodox costume.
There was a row. Dunn demanded his fee, and it
was produced, but lie was told that the audience
and Hie Press Association would hear all about it.
So Master John capitulated, and I don’t think he
ever tried the experiment again.
“H.M.”: Allan Wilkie’s failure to draw
business with "Tito School for Scandal” re-
calls that the same piece was used to open
the original Theatre Royal, iu Bourke-streot,
Melbourne, on July t>, 1855; and it was a
failure then. Mrs. Charles Poole was Lady
Teazle, and the Sir Peter was G. H. Rogers,
the first really great actor whose stage career
started in Australia. It was the opposition
at Coppin’s new theatre in Lonsdale-street,
the Olympic (alias “The Iron Pot”), which
had opened in May, that killed the Royal’s
first venture; and the management did only
slightly better when it engaged the well-
known adventuress herself to play in “Lola
Montez in Bavaria,” a five-act drama in
which she was gifted witli all the virtues.
Audiences came at first expecting something
well spiced, but stayed away when they found
stodge instead.
“Lysander” : Pauline Frederick exploits a
little mannerism of
expression which is
as piquant as it is
surprising. It is a
momentary lifting
into a smile of the

moments, so unex-
pectedly (perhaps
unconsciously) that
it leaves the on-

if the tragic touch

“Temsee” : “Centurion’s” par. (B. 7/5/’25)
re Connie Gilchrist throws my memory with
a pleasant jerk back to the jolly ’seventies,
when I lirst saw her, then a lily-fair sylph-
like child, doing dancing turns on the London
music-hall stage. That was before Hollings-
liead secured her as an addition to his Gaiety
galaxy. Boys (I among them) and baldies
alike fell plumb to the bottom of love’s pre-
cipice at first sight of Connie’s exquisite
child-like face, and her finely moulded, slender
young form—her outstanding assets as a per-
former, for she entirely lacked theatrical
talent. She had none of the precociousness
of the ordinary stage-child, nor was she in-
elined to be “sporty” as her teens increased.
But being under totally inefficient parental
guardianship, she was naturally exposed to
temptations galore to take wrong turnings.
From this dangerous position she was rescued
by the Earl of Orkney, who took her away
from the giddy surroundings of the burlesque
stage and gave her his name. The Duke
<>l Beaufort, whom “Centurion.” mentions in
connection with Connie's startling appear
since at the Badminton hunt meeting, made
no secret of his infatuation for the lovely
little dancer. Although blessed with a stately-
beautiful wife and grown-up family, “that
autocratic old Turk,” as “Centurion” ap-
propriately dubs him, paraded this young girl
in his company on important social occasions.
It was rumored in the clubs that these pro-
ceedings came to the notice of Queen Vic-
toria, and that the old lady, always a stickler
tor the observance of the proprieties (in
public, at least), made known her displea-
sure to her frisky, elderly ducal subject iri
very severe terms.
“The Deacon”: Captain John Griffiths,
who died recently in Sydney, combined the
two arts —war and music. Born in South
Wales, he won the King’s scholarship at an
early age, at 15 conducted a performance
of 150 harps, and later sang successfully
with Madame I'atey. Forty years ago he
joined up with the guns in Sydney, and
achieved the rank of captain.
“Neebsah” : “Minim” said lately that Sulli-
van was not a humorist “till he settled down
to work with Gilbert.” What about “Cox
and Box” —libretto by Morton and Bur-
nandV is there a more delightful specimen
of antithetical musical fun than the lullaby
“Hush-a-bye, Bacon” ? And does not humor
fill Box’s recital of his mock suicide proceed-
ings? The “Buttercup” duet also should
change the features of anyone who can smile.
Could other than a humorist superinduce a
frame of mind that could build such melodic
and scholarly joking on such verbal inspira-
tion? In “Cox and Box” musical humor is
pressed down and running over. Why search
for legitimate successors to Sullivan? There
are none.
“Ancient Prompter”: Pity John Kirby (B.
7/5/’25) didn’t reach London in time to
put in a claim to play his old part in “Rain.”
Although a New York success, Somerset
Maugham’s play was neglected by English
managers till Basil Dean recently secured tin'
rights, and, West End playgoers having been
educated up or down to that type of piece,
it was produced last week. Kirby’s perform-
ance of the bibulous storekeeper in the Mel-
bourne production was one of the best
bits of genuine comedy seen on the Aus
tralian stage.
“E.T.”: I did not suggest that Joseph
Coyne, after a year’s tour of the Common-
wealth, had become an Australian, as
“Marko” (B. 7/5/’25) thinks. That should
have been , fairly obvious from the context,
since of the six names I quoted from the
English “No, No, Nanette” programme, only
one is owned by a local product—Vera
Pearce. I saw Joe on his first appearance
in London, long before “The Merry Widow”
days, in a concoction from the U.S.A. called
“The Girl from Up There”—one of the first
of Uncle Sam’s “musical comedies,” and a
very raw attempt. Joseph himself was
rather raw at that period, but decidedly
funny both in his acting and in liis eccentric
dancing. Why the dancing comedian elected
to come to this country to play “straight
Charles Hawtrey roles is one of the mys-
teries, though I admit he made a fair job
of it.
“F.N.W.”: Gene Gerrard, the comedian
“discovered" in the latest London Gaiety
success, “Katja, the Dancer,” has toured
Australia and caused many a guffaw,
although he never spoke a word. For years
he was assistant to George Mozart, and
when George impersonated a “full” band on
the stage, Gene whacked the drum. It was
in this guise that he entertained Sydney
Tivoli audiences. After returning to Eng-
land he broke away from Mozart and hatched
an act of his own. He also played lead in
the Midnight Frolics; Monty Woolf and
Marie Courtney, daughter of Marie
Lloyd, were also in the cast. Gerrard
is a clever comedian of the quiet, natural
type, and one of the few who can invest
that abomination of a stage character, the
semi-soused “swell,” with humor instead of
vulgarity.
“Hasen”: It was at Melbourne Tivoli.
The overwhelmed-looking little man seemed
just as keen to hear the show as I was, but
the large, firm woman beside him, a picture
of the masterful wife, kept remembering a
number of bones in urgent need of picking.
Though I didn’t catch many of her words
I couldn’t miss the stern note of censure in
all of them, and her complaining voice made
an unpleasant accompaniment to the artists
on the stage. Turns came and turns went,
but that voice seemed likely to go on fot
ever. The little man looked helpless and
unhappy. I had just about decided to search
for a better ’ole, when a gossiping flapper
in the seat ahead said to her companion : “You
know, dear, they don’t speak off the stage.”
She was referring to the vaudeville pair per-
forming at the moment. “Oh. yes, my dear,
it’s a fact. Seven years ago they had a most
awful row. One of them said something to
the other, and they haven’t: spoken to each
other since.” The little man leaned forwai’d.
“Excuse me, Miss,” he asked wistfully, “but
you don’t happen to know exactly what was
said, do you?”
AN AGE OF JAZZ.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were waltzes, gay mazurkas,
Lively jigs and reels for workers,
Uaneors knew the joys the tarantella has;
Now we deprecate such measures,
Giddy whirls and panting; pleasures,
Moderation marks 'the present Age of Jazz.
For our grandmammas , danced madly ;
Now we take our pleasures sadly,
Willi solemn steps and partners far apart.
We mannuivre most sedately
To the strains they've brought in lately,
The syncopated hymns of modern art.
Now the chaperon has vanished,
And the Cosy Corner’s banished ;
Temptation no more lures a girl astray
With exciting, swaying dances
And the passionate romances
Of the ballroom in our dear old grandfolks’ day.
With the One-step and the Two-Step,
And the “Pardon, After You’’ step,
Timid Tango, and the Fox-trot, sad and slow,
So discreet, these latest fashions,
(.'iris need never fear the passions
That engulfed their giddy grannies long ago.

NINETY-FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS OF
THE BANK OF AUSTRALASIA,
WITH THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR TO 13th OCTOBER, 1924,
PRESENTED TO THE PROPRIETORS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING HELD QN
THURSDAY. 2nd APRIL, 1925.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at 13th October last, with the Profit
Account for the year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and Australasian
rates and taxes, and making provision for bad and doubtful debts and other contingencies, the net
profit for the year amounted to .£029,904/8/7.
To this lias to be added £120,427/17/1, brought forward from the previous year’s account, making
a total of £750,332/5/8.. From this, £200,000 was paid as an Interim Dividend and Bonus on 3rd
October last, and the Directors have now appropriated a further sum of £200,000 to pay a final
Dividend and Bonus, making in all £520,000, equal to 13/- per Share, and representing for the year
a Dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, and Bonus of 3 per cent., both free of Income Tax. The Directors
have also transferred £75,000 to the Reserve Fund and applied £25,000 in reduction of the cost
of Bank premises; £130,332/5/8 will remain to be carried forward to the next account.
The Dividend and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on 3rd April.
The Directors, with much regret, have to record the death, in April last, of Sir Walter Jeans, who
had spent nearly 60 years in the service of the Bank, and had been a member of the Court of Directors
since January, 1919.
To fill the vacancies on the Board caused by the retirement of Viscount Chelmsford in January,
1924, and by the death of Sir Walter Jeans, the directors elected Mr. Kenneth Goschen and Mr. John
Sanderson, whose appointments will be submitted for the approval of the proprietors.
The directors retiring by rotation are: Right Hon. Lord Aldenham; Horace Peel, Esq., and
Kenneth Goschen, Esq., who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The auditors, Messrs. Deloitte, Plender, Griffiths and Co., offer themselves for re-election.
Since the date of the last report new branches have been opened at North Sydney, Ceasnock and
Hamilton, in New South Wales, and a site has been acquired at Canberra, the future Federal CapitaL
The branches at Pingclly (Western Australia) and Motu (New Zealand) have been closed.

IV e have examined the cash and securities in London and the London books, and have verified the
transfers from the several branches in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and we beg to report that,
in our opinion, the foregoing is a full and fair balance-sheet of the Bank, and that it exhibits a true

This wondrous trip cf over 3600 miles—via some
of the loveliest scenery in the world —is now
easily within the reach of most Australians, for
the fares are really most moderate.
The Canadian Pacific Railway
has a service that is unequalled. Trains that are
havens of comfort and relaxation—hotels that are
the latest in luxury—steamships that combine
speediness in transport with every modern con-
venience that you could desire. And you can book
all accommodation prior to your departure.
Remember that you can obtain through tickets in
connection with the Canadian Australasian Royal

unequalled service to and from Vancouver, B.C.

John H. : No fresh thought in it....
Nugget: Try to make it more crisp. And get it
into a quarter the space... .Leamington: Fair jingle ;
but hardly worth the area it covers... .W.H.H.:
Not much of a treasure, we’re afraid... .Souffle:
You know things, but you’ve got an untidy mind
Get to work and sort out your facts before you
write... .Glen A.: Do be earetul —there are dozens
of bores deeper than that.... A.M.J.: Look up
Hazell’s Annual for 1920 —“May 1, 1919: May
Day Riots in Paris ; processions broken up by cavalry ;
600 casualties.” Naturally you wouldn’t see any-
thing from the Madeleine; and the war censorship
was still operating. The next year there were 120
casualties among the police, and 118 civilian wounds
were attended to at military dressing-stations....
Gindigah: Thanks, but scores of others are doing
it....H.5.; “Amalgamation” is too thin... .H.W.H.:
An old Greek name for a territory usually identified
with the Malay Peninsula Twig: No sap in it
Wiremu: Maori anecdote not suitable... .J.S.D.: As
verse there has been better, but it would be a
shame to waste the invitation:—
(“A message from Doom states that the ex-Kaiscr
is seemingly content with the monotonous life of
sawing wood, of which he has enormous stacks.”)
I own a farm among the hills,
Where forest giants wave,
And there for years to clear the land
I’ve toiled just like a slave;
A little patch among the trees
Is all my years have gave.
Now should Bill e’er get hunted out
For want of timber there,
Just let him cross the seas to me,
For, I have trees to spare,
And he may chop enough fuel here
To last when he goes there.

Written to death; and the verse is very p00r....
Gordon M.: Far too many lumps in it... .8.N.5.:

.... Ripponlea: A very moving ditty:—
Comes from the kitchen a comforting cackle.
’Tis the ham and eggs that I’m going to tackle,
Floating about within tlj| skilly
Like the blooms of a beautiful water-lily.
When they’re on my plate I eat like a neddy.
Gosh! How I wish they’d get ’em ready!
I’ll eat ’em down to the very last dregs,
For I’m dead nuts on ham and eggs.
I sit and list to the sound they’re makin’,
And wond’ring whether ’tis ham or bacon.
Ma often says, she says: “Good gracious,
Can’t you have a little patience?”
Now, fish and chips are tolerably good;
And steak and onions are wholesome food.
But do you know, I seem to have hollow legs
Whenever I’m eating ham and eggs ?
.... Remee: Conventional yarn poorly t01d....
H.E.8.: Offer it to the “rather charming young
lady.” Charming young ladies can stand a good
deal these times... .E.M.D.: Has some feeling, but
is too crude. See if you can’t improve... .P.O’F.:
You are the sort of person who thinks a bad
smell is humorous V.K.L.: Has some good spots
and a lot of poor ones... .S.H.G.: Not terribly bad,

thing that has not been said so often.... Sam C.:
Nothing like enough there to make a yarn....
J.D. (Dubbo) : The verse doesn’t carry it through.

poor; the prose makes mirth in a heavy and false

“Wattlepac” is not quite bright enough; the other
is p00r... .Clover Patch: He had the worst temper
and you called him “The Vixen.” Perhaps that
accounted for his temper. Why didn’t you just
call him Susan if you must mix the sexes ?....
W.D.T.: Not well enough done... . J.M.S.D.: Not
for us K.A.F.; The “Poet” doesn’t stir u 5....
A.V.H.: Not the meat for this pie.. '.. J.A.G.: Written
in an eighteenth-century manner to describe a

to print a thousand things we can’t for lack of

sake of the living it had better be left where it is.

Y essel : The first export of Australian
to East” took place as early as
IMU. In a despatch of that year Governor
Japps stilted that the commissariat had
bought 170 tons of salt meat and shipped it
to Canton in the barque George IV. It
was intended for the use of the British
forces in the first Chinese War.
* * * .
“Parama”: Fiji has entered the list of
butter-exporting countries. The first ship-
ment to England, three tons in 1120 boxes,
went from the Rewa Factory. The
industry is in its infancy as yet, but there
are many in the islands who consider there
arc big things ahead for Fiji butter, and
cheese as well, if the business is carefully
handled.
* * # #
~ Scrub”: For “Toby C.’s” informa-
tion (B. 30/4/’25) let me state that Queens-
iPaiiP c °tt° n crop will average no more than
4001 b. per acre, and the heaviest crop will
not exceed 15001 b. As a grower, it would
cause a thrill in my young life to meet
with, the prodigy who garners 3161 b. of the
l-ri o Wol 'king day. He would surely earn
liis il~ 10s. per week. Picking rates range from
Id. per lb. in Southern Queensland to 2£d.
per lb. in the Burnett. A fast picker work-
“lS in a good crop seldom touches more than
t-01b. in eight hours. The record for this
season stands at 1371 b. As the grower col-
lects only per lb., the picker is getting
his share, even though he never attains such
Munchausen figures as 3161 b. per day.
* * * *
“Hayeworray”: The statement that an ex-
perienced sorter can tell a treasury-note from
a postal-note or from anything else by the
feel of it through the envelope (B. 30/4/’25)
is generally true ; nevertheless it reminds me
that someone slipped in his estimate of a
letter that I recently put in a mailbag while
in charge of a small office. It never reached
its destination in a Melbourne suburb, though
it was of no value to anybody outside our
family. It was an old letter written over 20
years, and had been carried in a man’s pocket
tor months, till it was permeated with the
scent of tobacco, peppermint-lollies, etc.; also,
fringed and soft at all corners, it had doubt-
less every “feel” of a bank note. Perhaps it
was an amateur who was foiled. He was
certainly fooled.
* * * *
The High Court could not agree with
Justice Harvey, the N.S.AV. Equity Judge,
that a broker has the right to make a profit
for himself out of shares he is carrying for
a client. William Tilley and Co., the de-
fendants, contended that, according to Syd-
ney Stock Exchange custom, when they
bought for a client shares which they under-
took to carry at a certain rate of interest,
they were not bound to tender the identical
shares which they bought to fill his order,
but were entitled to make any use of them
they pleased—all they were bound to do was
to produce shares of precisely the same char-
acter upon demand. The High Court held
that the custom claimed was apparently not
admitted unanimously, and that in any case
it was not a custom which the law could
endorse in the absence of specific agreement.
Sixenate”: None too soon a Melbourne
magistrate has dropped heavily on the old
plea put forward by scores of people charged
with “no visible lawful” that they have work
as bookmakers’ clerks. His Worship ruled
it out in the case that came before him as
too “indefinite” an occupation. This will be
a blow for the flashly-dressed vagrant who
has been accustomed to assure the Court,
with or without his tongue in his cheek, that
he. derives a steady income from pencilling
for Iky Mo. The notorious “Squizzy” Taylor,
pleading penitence and a desire to walk the
straight path, had been “given a chance”
again in regard to his first wife’s mainte-
nance, which is painfully in arrears, on the
plea that he is regularly employed as a
bookie’s offsider and trying to make good;
and although there may be a doubt about
the penitence of a man who buys motor-cars
while such debts are owing, his job really
does seem regular and he lias very obvious
reasons for good future behavior. But
attached to the turf in Victoria are quite a
number of speculative bookmakers—-men who
do not field as a regular thing, but pay their
fees regularly on the off-chance of finding
mates who will provide them with a “bank"
on half shares. The racing clubs are trying
to get rid of these gentry; but whilst they
exist they are a great stand-by to crooks who
want a bookmaker to come along and swear
to their employment.
* * * *
“Oxmead” : The bankruptcy law stretches
out a long arm now and again across the
world and beyond the grave. Forty years
ago a Bristol (Eng.) brewer decided that his
financial difficulties were such as to make a
change of scene desirable, and left rather
hurriedly for Australia. His estate was
realised by a duly appointed trustee for the
benefit of the creditors. The liabilities
amounted to many thousands, and the assets
paid five or six shillings in the pound. Then
the trustee obtained a release from his job
and the Official Receiver took hold of what
was left of it, which didn’t seem worth any-
body’s worrying about. But you never can
tell. The bankrupt was not long in getting
on his feet in this country, and soon began
to prosper exceedingly at his trade of brewer
and brewery manager. He established him-
self at Perth (W.A.) and became an affluent
citizen, dying at well over 80 in 1917 and
leaving a substantial wad behind him. A
cheque for a legacy was received by a rela-
tive in Bristol, and this, coming to the know-
ledge of the Official Receiver, reminded that
individual or someone in his office that the
testator in Westralia was still an uncerti-
ficated bankrupt, never having applied for
his discharge in England. The Bristol Bank-
ruptcy Court thereupon promptly claimed the
estate from the Australian trustees, and after
a legal tussle secured it and paid in full
all the brewer’s creditors of 40 years ago,
or their representatives, with interest added.
The Australian heirs and assigns merely got
what was left. The last act of the drama
took place the other day in the Bristol
County Court —the formal annulment of
the bankruptcy of a man who has been dead
eight years and whose liabilities have since
been discharged by no act of his own.

CRAIG &AITKEN,
654 George Street, Sydney.
The late George Lydiard, of Faithfull’s
Creek (Vic.), besides being a nephew of
Sturt the explorer, was a descendant of the
Captain Lydiard who was in command of
the Royal George when she turned turtle and
sank at anchor, taking down with
her Admiral Kempenfeldt and over TOO men.
“1.R.C.”: My late father, Col. J. A. Camp-
bell, who died last year, aged 81, was an older
member of the A.I.F. than Private Jack
O’Brien (B. 16/4/’25). He was 74 on
enlistment. He was an Indian Mutiny
veteran and had a bar to his medal for Luck-
now. In the late war he was on transport
duty.
There were no commission agents in the
first lot of councillors for the City of Syd-
ney, elected on November 1, 1842. The iist
included seven merchants, three butchers,
two each of solicitors, publicans, builders and
tanners, a cabinet-maker, a dentist and drug-
gist, an esquire (n.e.i), a linendraper and a
merchant tailor.
“Looker-on”: “Sucre” (B. 30/4/’25) asks
if a minister can conduct his own marriage
service. The answer is an emphatic No.
Though no Act expressly forbids it, the fact
that an oath must be administered debars
anybody from performing his own marriage
ceremony, as no instrument of the law may
administer an oath to himself or take his
own declaration.
“Wilfrido”: A decision of the M.L. Full
Court the other week will hardly encourage
K.C.’s to forsake the Bar for the Bench.
The Court decided that the £1333 allowed
annually to Worley Basset Edwards, a re-
tired Judge, is taxable as a pension, brush-
ing aside the recipient’s contention that it
was earned income and payment in consider-
ation of his services to the State.
“Centurion” : Fact has again been plagiar-
ising fiction —this time Kipling's yarn
of the cobra which guarded the king’s trea-
sure. Recently a Newcastle (N.S.W.) resi-
dent died, leaving a letter which revealed
the hiding-place of a hoard of money under
his house. When the searchers went after
the buried treasure they found a big black
snake coiled up on the spot marked X. He
had all the advantages of position, and it
took some time and trouble to shift him.
His trust panned out £lO9 in a corked
pickle-bottle.
“The Rumpus” : The recent beer strikes in
Tassy and Wostralia remind me of a similar
desert period 15 or 16 years ago on the W.A.
goldfields. When the strike was at its high-
water mark, two drinkers with their tongues
hanging out went into a pub and called for
two pints. “Do ye know that pints be a
shillin’ aich here?” asked the publican, a
rough old identity of the dry-blowing days.
“Don’t give a what they are,” answered
one man ; “give us the drinks.” Erin struck
the counter with a fist like a stamper. “Git
out av me bar-r-r,” he shouted, “ye dirtily,
low scabs, ye!”
When the late Premier Tom Bent was
taken to Mont Park by Inspector-General
Jones,' of the Lunacy Department, and
tempted to buy the State a new lunatic
asylum, he told his mentor that if he could
quote a text of Scripture suitable to the
occasion he might be influenced. At the
moment, Bent stood on the highest part,
perspiring from the climb. Jones was a quick
thinker. “And the Devil led Him into a
high mountain and showed Him” he
murmured. “Tlie.land’s yours,” said Tommy.
Mont Park was established and its suit-
ability is generally admitted. To the last
Bent loved a land deal.
“Bullwhanger” : About a year ago I came
across a Bulletin par. from some shellback
contributor who mentioned that in a long
seafaring career he had never heard of a
Jew in a ship’s company. At that time I
was shipmates with one of the Chosen, His
name was Myer Lazarus and he had been
in several ships, Australian, English and
American, and also the R.A.N. He had a
second mate’s ticket, which he got after
leaving the A.I.F. I was going to reply to
the par at the time, only the nearest post
office was about 500 miles astern and getting
further every day.
Up till a few years ago the duties of
Crown Prosecutor and Crown Solicitor in
S.A. were carried out by the same man. On
the retirement in 1914 of the late C. J.
Dashwood, K.C., the duties were divided
between Richards —at present Acting Judge
—and Shierlaw. In 1920 the latter went
into private practice and a youthful ex-
Digger, Eric Millhouse, was appointed Crown
Prosecutor. Owing to the heavy pressure of
his work —he is permitted to chase Costs as
well—Millhouse wants to resign. However,
the Government has lightened his duties by
handing out Crown briefs to barristers in
private practice; and Bill Denny has seen
that so far all of them have gone to Digger
members of the profession.
In the old days Tasmania exported to
Maoriland whalers and sealers, bluegum seed,
’possums and pirates. Maoriland has its
revenge these days by exporting professors
and teachers to the Speck. The latest batch
came via England. Allan B. Taylor, the
new Professor of English for the Tasmanian
Uni., was an Auckland boy who, having
been wounded and gassed in France, went
with a war scholarship to Merton College,
Oxford, where he took his M.A. He also
played Rugby for his ’Varsity. The .iob
of Professor of Mathematics has been handed
to B. Milne Thompson, M.A., a Maorilander
noAv at Cambridge, who has done a lot of
original work on the theory of tides. Even
the new Lecturer in Economics, Horace Bel-
shaw, comes from over the Tasman.
“Sixenate”: The expenses allowed to
policemen who are detailed to go on the jag
in order to secure convictions against the people
they jag with were mentioned in a Melbourne
case the other day. For dinners in a city
restaurant where the disguised John Hop
“clicked” with the affable ladies who took
him to the place where the liquor was, for
the taxi that carried them and the drinks
they consumed £3 15s. was allowed ; and in
a vague sort of way it was mentioned that
“general Licensing Branch expenses” made
the bill £3 more. The bill was an addition to
the fine and costs imposed upon the victims,
which seems like charging a fish for the bait
that caught it. What the “general Licensing
Branch expenses” are was not explained ; it
is presumably a charge imposed upon those
who are caught to pay for the bait wasted
on others who are not caught.

There is Nothing Like
a Smile When the Teeth
are Plaza Cleaned
Plaza-cleaned teeth aid a charm-
ing smile. There is no charm like
the smile of a lovely woman, but:
the essential of a smile is the beau-
tiful sparkle of clean, white teeth.
What a delight to know that your
teeth are white and pearly, and
that you can smile with every con-
fidence and not need to try and hide
the teeth.
I'se I’laza Tooth Paste, contain-
ing Milk of -Magnesia, night and
morning, and see the difference.
It not only means bright, clean,
attractive teeth, but protection
from decay and tender gums.
Ask your Dentist the advantage
of Milk of Magnesia in a Tooth-
Paste.
He knows, and can tell you of
the benefit you will derive.
“I consider Plaza Tooth Paste a truly
delightful dentifrice for cleansing- and
beautifying the teeth.”

The Revised Version.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NO brighter day had summer known
Since first her eager horns were
blown
Through cedar peaks and poplar towers
O’er Eden’s glades of sunlit llowers;
Ere yet the poppy knew how tall
Its shadow stood against the wall,
And the first roses of the glade
Laughed for the perfume that they made;
Ere Eve, the summer’s fairest mate,
Stood in the sunshine by the gate.
Because the day was made so fair
Remembrance stirred in all the air.
I heard the whispering of the trees —
Ten thousand tongues that murmured “Tlease
Re-write the story falsely told
Of memories too sweet to hold.”
The morning shadow lay at ten ;
I snatched a reed, i made a pen.
1 wrote in sunlight on green leaves
The tale the great green world believes
And holds against its growing heart
From every dream of time apart.
When man by labors hard and rude
An age against the world had stood
He reared one son who stood so fair.
With morning sunlight on his hair.
And morning power in both his hands,
That over hills and meadow lands
And teeming woods and sandy shore
His fame was ever more and more
Among-his heavy-footed kin.
They stooped a dull earth-prize to win ;
But he with eyes that looked afar
Claimed kindred with the morning star.
His Voice was music in their ear,
llis hunter steps outpaced tue ueer;
And none his subtle strength of wrist
In sheer man-contest could resist.
But when his thought would move on wings
He told unutterable things
That lit to flame each groping mind
Down ways that all the years kept blind.
The morning on his eager face
Made him the King of ail the race.
When God had planted Eden’s trees
And sown its glades with ecstasies
And built its walls of amethyst
To hold soft lights against the mist
That from the valleys of the world
At dawn and evening upward curled,
lie sent an angel down to wait
Upon the lilies at the gate.
An angel fair of face w r as sin*.
Winged only with the melody
That round her ever seemed to float
From the white throbbing of a throat
Most exquisitely made for song
Through summer sweetness warm and long.
Her perfect rapture seemed to drown
The lilies growing for God’s crown.
No brighter day had summer known
Since Eve stood by the gate alone
And one, kin of the morning star,
Looked on her beauty from afar,
Than this fair day when each green tongue
Told of the hours when love was young.
He stood beyond the shining gate,
Whose bars were close and hard as fate;
lie saw the arching cedar tall.
Reach its great arms across the wall
And, lithe of limb and strong of wrist,
He scaled the guarding amethyst,
Swung to the branches of the tree
And leaned o’er Eden dizzily,
Seeing from that high perch above
The first and sudden glance of love. .
Twelve score of lilies stood in state
Near to the barred and gleaming gate
When Eve beside the cedar root
First gazed upon forbidden fruit
Of lips half parted, eyes that seemed
To hold all joys her soul had dreamed.
The willing apple from that tree
Dropped down in Eden. On his knee
Man, heedless of all powers above,
Bending to beauty, told his love.
The lilies all uncared-for stood,
The great leaves sighed, for life seemed good;
And evening with long shadows kist
The wall of faithless amethyst.
No sweeter eve had summer known
Since God in Eden walked alone
And Heaven and Earth heard that still voice
That spake no doom and gave no choice;
But every leaf had tongue to tell
Of Adam when the world went well.
The gate flew wide; a lightning flame
Seared the white lilies red as shame.
From Eden, with a kingly pride,
A man took forth his angel bride;
And the low thunder rolling after
Drowned one sweet woman’s earthly laughter.
No kinder dark had summer known
Since, that great tempest overblown,
The man ana woman came apace
To a low valley whose green face
Was full of comfort in the dark.
I heard the leaves of grass remark
In low soft accents to the rose
flow humble was that evening’s close.
The circle of the camp-fire’s light
Was yellow on that bridal night.
A man had scaled the tree of life,
Robbed Heaven of an angel wife;
And all the gracious days to be
Were singing to eternity.
The tree of good and evil stood
High on the crest of every wood;
And love’s swift foot need never fail
Another Eden’s wall to scale.
It yet might chance the falling tears
Or Eve in yellow changing years
Would from the warm earth’s bosom brown
Grow whiter lilies for God’s crown.

The Roue and the Rose.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I OVERTOOK Jamieson on the top step
of the club. Jamieson is a tubby sort
of chap, rich in both simple faith
and Norman blood. The February day had
made something of a sticky mess of him, but
there was no attempt to hide the fact —
he mopped the streaming portions with
earnestness and assiduity. “A bit moist,”
I remarked in an original manner. Jamie-
son spluttered assent through a fresh wave
of moisture that threatened to engulf him,
adding the information, “Wilson’s just gone
in; ..ire’s wearin’ „ the most astonishing
Panama”. The words brought the thrill of
animation back to my wilting spine. Life
was real, life was earnest. YY ilson was
more galvanic than a dozen loves. “Lead
me to him!” I implored, and Jamieson, with
a grin, trod beside me with the springy
step of those the Great Architect has built
on the globular rather than the vertical
plan.
We found Wilson draped along two chairs
in the big window of the smoking-room in
the company of the youngest member and
Jenks, the only American in the club ; and
he’s more Spanish than American owing to
years of vice-consnlling in Spain when a
young man.
As we drew near Wilson uncoiled his
length and hounded forward, grabbing our
two right hands in his left and right. “My
dear boys, irvy old friends! What a delight
it gives me to be back again in your com-
pany—after so long, after so many perils!"
“I thought you had been in Cairns,” Jamie-
son said doubtfully, disentangling himself
from Wilson’s wistful clutch, and dropping
into a corner of the lounge, piglike collaring
three of its cushions, while I at the other
end had to be discontented with one. Wilson
paid little heed to the half-query, lie sig-
nalled the drink waiter, and when the re-
fresher each had named stood before him
Wilson shook his head in smiling sadness.
“Not Cairns,” he whispered. “Ecuador!”
lie paused on the name as though it were
soul-blistering. Nobody registering horror,
only polite curiosity, he nodded three times
i?i the manner of one who, having been
through the storms and stresses of life, broods
over innocent children at their play. "Ecua-
dor !” he muttered; and again “Ecuador!”
Then, on a rising note, “What do you know
of Ecuador save as a Trans-Andean bit of
territory wedged between the Coca and the
Napo? Magnetic Napo,” he murmured, as
though tasting something bitter-sweet to the
lips. “Rut of the romance of that marvel-
lous country ringed about with the snow
peaks of the Cordilleras and the Andes, swept
with the mirage of the fevered desert, the
seaboard steeped in the river mists that stew
in men's brain till a hell-broth is fermented
and ready to pour like boiling lava over just
and infiocent alike, you know naught.
Cold, platinum, emeralds, lovely women and
lawless men” —his voice trailed away, and
he beetled over his glass before flinging its
contents down his throat. He then lit an
amazing cigarette, while the youngest mem-
ber said, “Anyhow, it is too hot for golf.”
and fitted himself more snugly into his chair.
I managed to sneak another of Jamieson's
cushions; Jenks was as one asleep.
“When I stepped off the boat at—wo will
say for the sake of camouflage—Guayaquil,”
Wilson said reflectively, “I scarcely ex-
pected it to be the setting for the most amaz-
ing drama in which it has been my lot to
act as super. On the boat I had struck up
acquaintance with a cotton-grower named
Del Marques and his beautiful daughter,
Esmeralda. Esme, as her father preferred
to call her, had been for some years finishing
off her education in the different capitals of
Europe, and was now returning to make her
father’s homes, for he had many of them,
ring with her laughter and the sound of her
guitar. Like all daughters of the South,
Esme sang charmingly to this delicious in-
strument, and many an evening the monotony
of the eternal stars and the restless ocean
had been turned to enchantment by her
duets with a slim, dark young pas-
senger who was, like herself, an Ecuadorian.
T.ike herself, too, he was returning from
Paris, where he had been gathering experi-
ence for the management of his mother’s
modest rubber plantations. A poor young
man, but beyond reproach—the only son of
his mother, and she a widow, and also of
impeccable character, I gathered. The small
rubber holdings had been derived from the
honest savings she had been able to extract
from avaricious managers when an actress
in Buenos Aires.”
.Tenks made a sign which the waiter rightly
interpreted, and, everybody putting a name
to it. the account was carried on.
“This young man, Tonio Piehincha, was
a fine upstanding fellow, with the bearing
and manners of the thousand or so dons
of old Spain whose blood was said to irri-
gate his veins. Well, what with the stars and
the love duets, the al fresco and the dolce far
niente of the voyage, the engagement of the
two young things was a cinch before the
voyage was a week old. And. strangely
enough. Papa Marquez, in spite of his
emerald mines and his cotton holdings, had
none of your rich father’s reluctance to the
match. He liked Tonio, and admired Tonio’s
widowed mother, and such is the inflammable
nature of those regions where even love is
volcanic that the wedding was planned to
take place a few days after our arrival in
—we will say for the sake of the story—
Guayaquil.
“But Fate willed otherwise. Even as our
boat moved with majesty into the harbor, a
high-voltage motor-launch spurning the
water to such a degree that she nearlv leaped
out of it at every throb, hurled herself along-
side with a message for Tony bidding him
to hurry, as his mother was lying very sick
in her villa above the town. There was a
confusion of farewells, and the minute the
boat struck the wharf that boy was over and
rattling away out of sight in a kind of sulky
that was waiting for him. Very picturesque
these conveyances are. too. Built very high
on rubber-tyred wheels, they have a sort of
palanquin cover, generally of red, finished
off with a tasty yellow fringe. It was into
another of these that Esme and her father
leaped and soon were carried out of my
vision by a high-stepping, coal-black steed.
“Later in the day, after the siesta, the
same colorful carriage reined up between the
cool green of the palms in the courtyard
and the white glitter of the marble of the
hotel, and Senor Marquez bore, me off in it
to the equally glittering marble structure of
his club. Here introducing me to a group
of rubber-planters, mine-owners and other
magnates, all in the millionaire class as per
current rate of exchange, he endowed me
with many mysterious honors and distinc-
tions. and in the twinkling of an eye the good
fellows had given me the freedom of the club.
But even while we were celebrating the occa-
sion in the usual liouid fashion, and com-
ments were being made on the sudden illness
of Tonio’s mother, the drink-waiter stumbled
and made a sudden recovery with his tray
—an almost uncanny juggling movement of
the wrists restored the balance of his glasses

A SLIP or false move with the kettle
or pan and you are badly scalded.
Instantly you hunt round for relief
from the pain. That’s where Zam-Buk
comes in so handy—applied to a scald,
burn or cut it speedily relieves the smart-
ing and inflammation. Where the skin is
blistered and broken Zam-Buk should be
applied on a bandage or piece of clean
rag.
But Zam-Buk does more than merely
soothe the pain and annoyance of home
injuries—being highly antiseptic it pre-
vents more serious influences, like fester-
ing and blood-poisoning, because it clears
and kills all disease germs.
Zam-Buk’s healing virtues are not
hindered by the presence of animal fats
and crude mineral drugs, such as cause
many salves and ointments to turn rancid
or useless. Zam-Buk retains the same
purity and curative efficiency almost
indefinitely.
Ready for instant use —moderate in
price—stocked by your chemist or local
storekeeper—these are three good reasons
why you should buy a box of Zam-Buk
and keep it handy—ready for emergencies.
1/6 and 3/6 per box everywhere.

so that not a drop was spilled. The episode,
slight as it was, riveted my attention on
him. Somewhere amid bizarre surroundings
—somewhere amid the sudden gleam of
knives—l had seen that face!
“Where had I seen the man before? Sleep-
ing or waking, the query for ever forced it-
self to the surface of my thoughts. Even
the sinister feeling of impending calamity
which permeated the club but served to em-
phasise the necessity of placing my man.
For within my first hour as an honorary
of that palatial building, I had sensed the
fear that held these men in its grip. It
was a fear that had nothing to do with
their worldly affairs. It was an individual
fear; it slumbered behind the eyes of every
member. This was the inner shrine of the
club world of the capital. Its members were
not only magnates of its money market,
they were the last dizzy pinnacle of its social
structure. Yet those men walked in fear
—a fear shared by all, yet unnamed by any.
“My knowledge of it began with the an-
nouncement by Senor Marquez of his daugh-
ter Esme’s engagement to young Pichincha.
“Splendid !’ ‘Congratulations !’ "Bravissimo !’
sounded fervidly on every side. Then some-
one remarked on the serious state of Senora
Pinchinclia’s health, and immediately came
that unnameable feeling into the atmosphere.
It was as though one suddenly touched a live
wire. The fellow next to me, with eyes like
the Inquisition, swept the group with a look,
twirled his glass slowly and asked whether they
knew Don Eugenio Salado had come to town
a day or two ago. lie added that someone
had told him the Don had been paying par-
ticular attention to his loses! This inno-
cent information had an amazing effect on
his listeners. Marquez pushed his chair back
angrily and strode from the room; a pale,
young man in the corner burst into tears;
a bull-necked man choked and gurgled.
‘Madre di Dios,’ gasped my neighbor, ‘will
Espego never learn sense? And you, Senor’
(turning to me), ‘you must think this of
a strangeness incomparable!’ He rose with
a gesture inviting me to accompany him, and
on the way back to my hotel he narrated an
extraordinary story to me.
“This Don Eugenio was a great roue,
and even now, though in the fifties, irresis-
tible to women. It the days of his youth,
I gathered, he had ranged a wide field, pluck-
ing any man’s wife or daughter who took his
fancy. Most of his amours were kept dark
at the time, but now. in middle-age, the
desire to tell where he had kissed had grown
a mania with him. For five years now, when
any of his former mistresses died,
subtly proclaimed their dishonor to the world
by attending their funerals, and at the last
moment, before the first spadeful of earth
rattled upon the wooden shell that clothed
the poor, erring human clay, he would drop
a magnificent bunch of pure white roses on
the coffin-lid. lie had first gained the neces-
sary notoriety by carrying out his diabolic
plan at the funeral of one of the country’s
best-known courtesans —a woman whom he
had openly owned as mistress for some years.
Next followed the most wanton public woman
of the city. Then a young woman, wife of
one of the club members, had died —a
wife above reproach in everybody’s eyes—
and to her friends’ consternation Don Eugenio
had showered a perfect wealth of white roses
upon her inanimate body. The husband could
scarcely be restrained from killing him at
the graveside; but by next morning the hus-
band had blown out his own brains beside
the desk whose secret contents disclosed
his wife’s dishonor. Then old Marques—
surely I had noticed Marques’s discom-
posure? Well, the same drama had been
enacted at the grave of Marques’s pretty
sister, and the same at the grave of the weep-
ing young man’s wife. Now everybody pre-
tended not to notice when the white roses
arrived. Men who still wanted to keep the
illusion of their dead ones’ love were afraid
to investigate for fear of finding the unpalat-
able truth. To summon Don Eugenio to a
duel would bring unwanted publicity, for
the old satyr owned the largest local news-
paper. Altogether the members of the club
were in a cleft stick. But now, if the Senora
Pichincha were to die, and Don Eugenio
were to insult her memory with his white
roses ! Of a surety two things would happen
—the son who adored his so-good mother
would do murder, and the proud Marques
would forbid the young people’s marriage.
“For a week the old lady lingered, and for
a week you must picture me taking my rides
up the mule tracks that seemed as though
they wound to the roof of the world; you
roust picture me being swung across un-
fathomable chasms in the Cordilleras or the
Andes on the taravita or cable-basket, dining
with my friend Marques in his palace above
the town; spending many hours in the cool
seclusion of the club, always haunted by
that nameless familiarity in the drink-
waiter. I took to watching him from under
half-closed eyelids till I found the suspicious
brute was regarding me in the same way.
“One afternoon I rode on my mule up from
the town in a new direction, and came upon
an exquisite old house set behind a high
white wall through which a green door gave
entrance. There was a camellia-tree throw-
ing its shadows on the white wall, and, stop-
ping to ruminate, I observed the club waiter
crouching in the doorway with his ear to
the wall. His was a sinister attitude. I
hastened away before he could recognise me,
and on inquiry I found that the charming old
place was the home of Don Eugenio. The
next morning I awoke early with a feeling
of foreboding and a slight chill upon me.
For the former I took the usual antidote,
and for the latter I determined on a vanor
bath.
“Now, a vapor bath is about the last
thing onp would be expected to take in that
climate in that season. But I have my own
system in these matters, and, making my way
to the club, I mounted, unnoticed, to the
bath floor, where in a secluded spot just
around from the magnificent swimming pool
stand the vapor baths. I prepared mine
according to my own formula, and just as I
was about to emerge I heard voices of sup-
pressed emotion coming from the direction'
of the swimming pool. I recognised their
timbre at once. It was the drink-waiter and
Tonio Pichincha.
“The young man was speaking the most
extraordinary things in a voice fraught with
emotion: ‘Father, she has told me all! Now
I understand the great kindness you have
ever showered upon me!’
“ ‘Tut, tut,’ the old man replied. ‘What
I could do, it w r as so little —a dash more gin
in the cocktail, a few degrees more coldness
in the champagne, the right warmth of the
claret.’
“ ‘I can never forget,’ brokenly ejaculated
the young man. Then : ‘Do you think that
monster for whom my mother deserted you
knows yet of her death?’
“ ‘Yes,’ whiskered the other. Tie is below
and with a cargo of roses!’
“ ‘The devil!’ bitterly exclaimed the young
man. ‘But I have the dagger here —see, my
mother pressed it into my hands. If Eugenio
dishonors me, see that the dagger does its
work.’
“ ‘Tush,’ whispered the waiter, and I
could see the gentle, commiserating smile
upon his lips: ‘youth and woman must ever
be impetuous. Give me the dagger.’
“After an indistinct murmur I again heard
clearly: ‘My father! You and I must never
part!’
“The two embraced, but the waiter’s voice
was determined. ‘No, son, our ways are
apart; I will now return to Buenos Aires.’
And the two departed to the lower floors.
“Wondering, I crawled out, got into my
clothes and sought the smoking-room. The
corridors were deserted, for the hour was
still early. I met no one. Opening a side
door into the room I was greeted by the
unusual sight of a dagger spinning through
space. But, like the bullet famous in Eng-
lish history, it had its hillet. It found the
same neatly behind the shoulder-blade of an
erect, elderly gentleman sitting in the far-off
corner. In the moment that I stood frozen
with horror the club was avenged. Don
Eugenio—for my instinct told me it was he
—sagged and crumpled up, an untidy heap
across the table. Even as I started forward,
for I was the only person present, the door
from the bar swung open, and the waiter
stepped to the side of the dead man.
“ ‘Your drink, sir,’ he murmured.
“I was stunned by such cunning, and hotly
advanced.
“‘I know whose hand sped that dagger!’
I said bitingly.
"‘The dagger, sir? Which dagger?’
“As he spoke he whipped the weapon from
its nest, quickly and scrupulously wiped it
on the dead man’s garment, and, before my
eyes, opened his mouth wide and neatly and
completely swallowed the evidence of his
crime.
“As he stood there performing this simple
feat, in a flash I recognised my man. He
was the world-famed sword-eater who had
performed at my first pantomime!”

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
HM.A.S. Venus was aimlessly patrol-
. ling the high seas when the leading
telegraphist on duty joyfully picked
up an SOS from s.s. Changwai, Australian-
bound with a rich cargo from the Orient.
Her Majesty’s Australian ship altered course
with alacrity, put on all speed, and in a
few hours lay off the trader where she sat
heavily on a coral reef with her clipper bow
at an angle of 40 degrees. It was dead-low
water, and the crunched, whitish coral
showed up sharply against the black hull,
and for background the misty, grey-blue
Queensland coast lay a quarter of a mile
away. The man-o’-war sent boats to her
assistance; but after a diver had reported no
damage beyond a few unimportant dents,
there was nothing to be done except waif,
for high water and give her a chance to
refloat. Followed the long wait for the tide
and her obdurate refusal to move, so there
was no other course but to jettison cargo.
Several tons of rice went overboard, and
cases of spirit and tobacco, bales of silk and
other treasures of “the East” floated on the
still blue sea. The naval cutters picked
up as much as they discreetly could, and,
stowing the loot out of sight, returned to
the Venus, boats were hoisted, and soon
rescuer and rescued went their ways.
Knowing the nature of the cargo jetti-
soned, and having little faith in human
nature, H.M. Customs up north sent a sig-
nal requesting Sydney to search H.M.A.S.
Venus on her arrival at Garden Island. In
due course the search party came aboard,
and, escorted by the first lieutenant and the
officer of the day, started on the officers’
quarters. Chests, drawers and bunks were
overhauled with the thoroughness of long
experience; from the cabins to mess decks
and storerooms and down into the very
bowels of the ship went the party. Ham-
mocks were laid out on the mess decks by
secretly irate ratings, and contents of brown
canvas kitbags were strewn out in orderly
manner for prying eyes. But nothing duti-
able was found.
When the quarter-deck was reached the
search was declared ended and the cheery
hosts took their guests to view the torpedoes.
With all the pride of the specialist, the tor-
pedo-lieutenant launched into a stream of
technicalities. “This is the warhead,” said
he, “containing 3501 b. of gun-cotton. When
the torpedo hits the objective, the pistol
ignites the gun-cotton and causes the explo-
sion” —and so on after the manner of his
kind the world over.
The propellers were put in motion, and the
Customs officers, suitably impressed with at
least one unit of the King’s Navee, shortly
took their leave with expressions of regret
over the object of their visit. The quarter-
master stood at the gangway, the officer of
the day solemnly saw them over the side, and
furtive smiles played round odd mouths.
Later in the day, when the time was ripe,
the leading torpedo-gunner, in the presence
of a few favored conspirators, proceeded to
strip down the torpedo. He blew through
her in the orthodox manner and unshipped the
pistol. Out of the chambers of the warhead
came many dozen boxes of choice cigars and
much tobacco to make the heart of man glad,
and of silks for padding a goodly store. With
complacent grins the loot was spirited away,
and 3501 b. of gun-cotton was put back where
it rightly belonged.

An uninspiring thing—a heap of matches lying dead in
your ash-tray.
But far from meaningless.
They have played their part in the affairs of nations.
They have died—for their country—or for a foreign land.
They have contributed their mite to Australia’s or an-
other nation’s wealth.
And what a mite it seems —until you multiply it by the
many millions of matches used in Australia every year.
Then the sum becomes important and impressive. Aus-
tralia needs that monev to enrich its own citizens, to pro-
vide work and wages for its own people.
Make your matches die for their country and their
country men and women.
