The Red Page
A Peripatetic Seer
Winifred Hamilton’s recent call in The
Bulletin to her sisters to be up and doing
in the matter of national eugenics finds a
sustained echo in the latest work of J. H.
Curie, To-Day and To-Morrow (Methuen).
The author of "The Shadow Show” got the
inspiration for this new book on the shores
of Hobson’s Bay, and frequent references
to this country occur. With his inveterate
peripatetic habit he took his revelation up
the Niger, labored it to grow on Lake Nyassa
and completed it on the mountains behind
Itio de Janeiro. These and other wander-
ings convinced him that the world, which
he once regarded as such a splendid spec-
tacle, is a very bad world indeed. In 60
years, if baby continues to arrive at the
present pace, it will be super-saturated. A
frightful struggle for each other’s hunting-
grounds will then ensue between the races.
The colored tribes are breeding at a terrific
rate. The whites are breeding, too, but
they are multiplying more at the bottom than
at the top. The imbecile, the half-wit, the
physically degenerate are reproducing their
ignoble kind in heroic style ; the brains, the
enterprise, under democratic conditions, are
being steadily bred out.
This, of course, is merely a pseudo-scien-
tific restatement of the thesis advanced by
Edward M. East, the American biologist, in
“Mankind at the Crossroads”; but whereas
East buttresses his arguments with a life-
time of laboratory investigation, Curie sup-
ports his by such general statements as this;
Excepting Tasmania and Victoria, the climate of
Australia is not first-rate. Most of it is too warm;
the Australian of 10 generations hence will be a
thin-blooded individual.
And whereas East, with all the known facts
at his disposal, is content with a very modest
recommendation that the worst types of
mental degenerates should be sterilised, Curie
rushes in with this:—
The passport has come back. Let us, as it were,
amplify the passport. Let it show our physical
inheritance back to our grandparents, and our own
precise record of health and disease; let it show
our education, our occupation, our special faculties,
and our citizen value to the State; let it show
finally, as the sum of these, and in the light of
ever-increasing knowledge about heredity, our fit-
ness or our unfitness to be a father or a mother.
If the dossier shows fitness, let a permit to breed
children (subject to yearly renewal) then be at-
tached ; if it shows unfitness, whether man or
woman, prince or pauper, let its owner be debarred
from breeding any children at all.
Thus Curie, the sanguine writer of en-
gaging travel-sketches. Now let us, as far
as layman can, present the merely scientific
attitude as given in current utterances. Pre-
sumably the Lord God will be invited to fill
in the blanks in Curie’s remarkable ticket-
of'leave, for One knows no human authority
capable of doing it. The medical fraternity
is itself very reticent on the efficacy of
eugenics to improve the race, and some even
claim that to breed children as racehorses
are bred would do more harm than good.
I>r. Lange, a Danish doctor, recently investi-
gated the family history of 70 insane
patients. These 70 represented 44 families,
and going back to their grandparents the
inquirer traced 358 cases of mental or ner-
vous disease. Here surely is a case for
refusal of a passport. Unluckily for Curie,
Dr. Lange continued his researches, and was
able to trace the majority of the healthy
collaterals of the 70 degenerates. They in-
cluded 2 Cabinet Ministers, 1 ambassador,
3 bishops, 8 clergymen, 3 generals, 3
admirals, 3 Supreme Court Judges, 4 head-
masters, 8 consulting physicians, 9 univer-
sity professors, 23 doctors of science or arts
and a large number of M’s.P., town council-
lors, teachers, business men and Government
officials; and, finally, two personages so high
that the investigator was unable to name
their rank for fear of revealing their iden-
tity. There were also 72 individuals who
had won distinction as poets, sculptors, com-
posers, inventors and (let Mr. Curie take
note)■ 18 authors. Not long ago an Ameri-
can biologist took the same line with the
much canvassed Jukes family, with pre-
cisely the same result; and ‘the dreadful
thought oppresses me that we do not know
what was the heredity of William Shaks-
pcare. I
The second part of Curie’s plan is the
systematic teaching of birth-control to the
lower orders, so that they may not swamp
the upper. Here again, however, there is
amongst the experts the gravest differences
of opinion. Says Morris Pishbein, M.D.,
editor of the Journal of the American
Medical Association :
One of the difficulties of arriving at a satis-
faetory formula for killing any sort of organism
within the human body lies in the fact that anv
solution that is sufficiently strofig to kill is also
sufficiently strong to irritate and destroy the living
body cells. 6
Mrs. Sanger, Marie Stopes. Ettie Rout and
Miss Bocker, the principal protagonists of
birth-control, each advocates a method which
she claims as ideal and which differs from
the others. The biologists are so little satis-
fied with the propaganda of these ladies that
they are experimenting upon quite different
lines One direction of research derives from
the discoveries of Metchnikoff and others
that the body builds up its own immunity
when it is infected with disease. The female
organism may thus, by anti-toxic methods
be immunised against the sperm cell of the
male. The second line of inquiry is based
on the fact that human glands when exposed
to the X-rays have evinced a tendency to
temporary or partial atrophy. But these
investigations only serve to show that the
matter is in a thorough state of flux. Birth-
control is doubtless practised by many with
eminent success. That it is a popular
science course which can be safely handed
over to the officials of a Health Department
like small-pox inoculation some of those best
able to judge flatly deny.
It is still possible, however, to enjoy
Curie’s book without accepting him as a
scientific seer. The chapter on the problem
of sex is written from the viewpoint of a
man of the world with considerable personal
experience. It is refreshingly frank, and is
worth the mound of goulash which comprises
the rest of the work.
M. G. S.
Romance in Australia
Reviewing a recent Australian novel one
paper said: “The scene is laid back in the
pioneering days, probably for the reason that
there was more romance in those times than
can be found in these days.” Is such criti-
cism justified? Is it true, or nearly true,
that there was more interest to be found in
past days than there is in those in which
we live?
In my own lifetime I have seen a man
who had no profession or trade carry his
swag along the Northern railway line of
N. S. Wales and live to become one of the
wealthiest men in one of our wealthiest dis-
tricts ; a bricklayer land in . Sydney from
England with nothing but his tin trunk and
the little clothing it contained retire on his
earnings and spend his last years as a legis-
lator in ease and luxury. I have seen one
who was brought up to the game and knew
it through and through beaten off a station
property by drought, and the rain fell in
torrents within six hours of the time he
had driven away with, almost nothing, he
could call his own. I have watched that
same man make good in other lines and gain
a name that is the envy of many. Two
others I have seen, one a bullock-driver and
the other a jackeroo without money, become
amongst the wealthiest of our landowners, and
they still have years ahead of them. Three I
have lived near who bought orchard land and
had not money enough to pay for the trees
with which to plant it until they went and
earned the necessary. cash in wages; to-day
they are drawing their thousands a year and
enjoying pretty nearly all the comforts that,
life can offer. These cases can be multiplied
indefinitely. If there is romance in money-
making we have it in plenty, as the boys
of 18 and 20 who clear three and four hun-
dred pounds in a single season’s trapping
can testify. And wliat of the selector and
his two sons who, sinking postholes, found
a fortune of many thousands in an outcrop
of ironstone? And in an adjoining district
the man who owns a very nice station, with
its thousands of sheep and hundreds of cattle,
that was won for him by one good horse?
Ask the timber-men who have been known
to lake more than £6OO worth of timber
out of one tree. Consider Ballarat and
Buninyong, Lambing Flat and Araluen, Hill
lOnd and Gulgong, Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie,
Mount Morgan and Broken Hill.
If you hold that there is no romance in
riches and the gathering of money, look this
way. What do you see? A plain, a vast plain,
dry, dusty, desolate. A hole is drilled, a
pipe is pushed a thousand feet down into
the earth and the desolation becomes a
garden. Is that not romance? If this is
the outcome of mere mechanical devices, and,
therefore, matter-of-fact, What about a
brumby-run with a splendid stallion leading
his mob to liberty? On one of these a
reward of two thousand pounds stood till
the noble animal, never headed, died in his
freedom!
If you can see romance only in the past,
what of the bones that lie beside the river,
bones that once belonged to a tribe of blacks
that angered the white men who had dis-
possessed them of their hunting-ground? And
heroism? Is there none of this in the man
who, his horse having fallen with him and
broken his leg, rode 60 miles for help? Can
you see a glimmer of it in the two young
fellows, neither of whom could walk owing
to an accident, who drove 80 miles through
the darkness of a winter night, or a trooper
who rode 116 miles without a stop to bring
relief? ,
If to you romance is beauty, or beauty is
romance, come to the Upper Murray and
worship at the feet of Kosciusko, be-
side us the noble river winding its way
through the glorious valley as it faces its
thousand-mile journey to the plains, there
to continue its leisurely way to the far-
off ocean. Come along to Bulli Pass, the
Valley of the Grose, Kauimbla and Leura.
Look down on Brisbane Water from the
Boys’ Home near Gosford. Take a run out
to Terrigal, queen of all surfing beaches.
Do a day’s trip through the Myall Lakes,
beyond splendid Port Stephens. Stand on
the Nandewar ranges, the ancient Warrum-
bungles or beautiful Canoblas and watch the
sun set far out, or a thunderstorm come
sweeping up over the plains.
If you say that romance is in none of
these, that it is in the building up of things
that make for prosperity, what of our sheep?
Is there no romance. in owning a hundred
thousand woollies or in breeding a ram, one
ram, that brings five thousand pounds in
hard cash? If romance to you is to be found
only in failure, we have that too. Look
on the lives that are being lived under
assumed names on stations, in country
towns, on wheat farms and under the shelter
of orchards by those whose real names, if
heard, would be known on the seven seas.
“No,” answers the objector. “Australia
has no romance. It has never seen war.”
War? War is ,a man’s game, and lots
of Australians know it; they have proved
it. But there are other games that are
better worth a man’s while. Australia has
them. If you possess the capacity to appre-
ciate romance, look around you. It is on
all sides. It is in the past, the present and
the future; love, hate, strength, weakness,
disaster, triumph—we have them all. Aus-
tralia is big enough and wide enough, old
enough and young enough, kind enough and
cruel enough, lovable and hateful enough
to be all things to all men, and that is the
very essence of romance.
W. M. FLEMING.
Some Ladies
When George II. was strolling in Kensing-
ton Gardens lie was accosted by a five-year-
old maiden who said, “Comment vous portez-
vous, Monsieur le roi? Vous avez une grande
ei belle maison ici, n’est-ce pas?” The King
was charmed with her, and she was often
sent for to visit him in his “grande et belle
maison.” The little girl was the Lady Sarah
Lennox, to whom George III. subsequently
lost his heart. She might have been Queen

PRESIDENT SUSPENDER CO. LTD.
50 York Street, Sydney. 326 Flinders Lane, Melbourne
of England had not the Queen-Dowager and
Lord Bute objected. George chose instead
a royal, if plain, wife in Charlotte Sophia
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, who bore him 15
children. The King was constant to plain
food and this plain wife through the course
of his decent and reputable life, but was as
much a martinet in his treatment of her as
in the discipline to which he subjected his
children.
When an officer of the Household informed
George IV. of the death of Napoleon in May,
1821, in the words, “Your Majesty’s greatest
enemy is dead,” the King rejoined earnestly
“Thank God she is,” assuming that the mes-
senger conveyed tidings of the royal consort’s
decease. His wife was one of the three
people whom George IV. hated. The other
two were his father and his daughter. The
Prince had espoused Caroline of Brunswick
on the condition that Parliament should
meet his liabilities and provide him with an
adequate allowance. The King did not care
whom his son married so long as she was
royal and Protestant. The Prince himself
said, “One damned German /ran is as good
as another,” and between a niece of his
mother’s and a niece of his father’s he chose
the latter on the ground that one of his
mother’s family was enough. When Caroline
arrived at St. James’s Palace her bridegroom
came from Carlton House to welcome her.
George entered, raised her from her kneel-
ing posture, embraced her casually and said
to Lord Malmesbury who stood by, “I am
not very well —pray get me a glass of
brandy.” At their wedding the bride was
grave, decent and orderly. The bridegroom
was so drunk that it was with difficulty he
could be kept from falling. He passed
his bridal night in the grate.' For
two or three weeks George and Caroline
lived together, and then parted as husband
and wife for ever. The Princess herself
admitted that the greatest mistake she ever
made in her life was to have married the
husband of Mrs. Fitzlierbert.
Mrs. Fitzherbert came from a great
Roman Catholic family. She was twice
widowed, but still youthful and beautiful
when the Prince fell in love with her. It
is probable that in the whole course of his
erotic career George IV. was never in love
with anyone save Mary Anne Fitzlierbert,
nee Smythe. The canon law of the Roman
Catholic Church recognised the ceremony of
marriage between the Prince and Mrs. Fitz-
herbert as valid. By the Act of Settlement,
however, the bride could never be Queen of
England, and had the marriage been proved
in law the bridegroom would have forfeited
his right of succession. Mrs. Fitzlierbert
preserved her “marriage lines” carefully, but
never, even under the greatest provocation,
did she avow her marriage with George.
She was supplanted in the royal favor by
a succession of mistresses, not to mention the
temporary royal bride from Brunswick.
When she died the documents relating to
the morganatic marriage were placed under
seal in Coutts’s Bank. The seals were
broken in 1905, when King Edward had the
papers removed to the royal archives at
Windsor. Mrs. Fitzlierbert never met her
husband after he became regent, and subse-
quently king, but on his death-bed George
begged of Wellington that nothing should
be taken from his body. He was buried in
the clothes he lay in, and the Duke noticed
a black ribbon suspended from the neck,
attached to which was a locket containing a
miniature of Mrs. Fitzlierbert.
When George 111. heard about his son
Clarence and Mrs. Jordan lie was perturbed.
“What, what? You keep an actress?” said
his Majesty. “Yes, sir,” replied William.
“How much do you allow her? What,
what!” “A thousand a year.” “A thousand
a year!” cried George in astonishment.
“What, what! That’s too much. Give her
five hundred. What, what, wliat!” The
Duke suggested the reduction to Mrs. Jordan,
who replied by sending him the bottom of
a playbill bearing certain significant words
ahout the return of money. Mrs. Jordan
was an Irishwoman who rose to the first
rank in the theatrical profession when given
comedy roles and parts in which she wore
breeches. Her morals were easy, and
“calls of maternity” caused frequent retire-
ments from the footlights. Her connection
with the Duke of Clarence lasted for more
than 20 years, during which she bore him
10 children. She died in Paris in 1816 in
poverty and neglect. On his death-bed Wil-
liam IV. sent for his children, and to each
gave a message. He had ennobled them, and
found them all lucrative appointments ; but
lie bade them “abstain from all royal pre-
tensions.”
In Regency Ladies (Hutchinson: Angus
and Robertson) these women and many more
live again in an entertaining study by Lewis
Melville.
GERALD DILLON.
Are We Too Sane?
Tlie history of Australian art up to the
present moment rather resembles the career
of a bright young student whose applica-
tion and industry have led him through
a creditable series of scholarship attainments
to the pleasant pinnacle of diplomadom. It
is all very satisfactory, and everyone is
delighted about the diplomas and the honor-
lists and the general excellence of his . tech-
nical equipment. But now, “What does he
mean to do?” ask some of us who are rather
more impatient than the rest of the nice,
easy-going public. This putting of the ques-
tion is not in the nature of pessimism or even
carping criticism, any more than are the
natural speculation and interest of the admir-
ing relations of the brilliant young univer-
sity graduate. Now he is fitted, he is going
to launch out for himself, they expect, and
they look to him to make good as a matter
of course.
Heaven forbid that such a thing as indi-
viduality in art should be forced into exist-
ence in Australia, and that the world should
be spattered in consequence with atrocities
in the manner of kookaburra patternings, or
emotions expressed in yellow seas of wattle
blossom, in a great strain after a national
individualism. May Australian art remain
paralysed for a century rather than suffer
corruption by contact with the booster! But
the very excellence of a large proportion of
Australian painting is g self-revelation of its
lack of individuality. If it were very indi-
vidual, pioneering new avenues ana unique
outlooks, it would still be rough and wild
and rather had. At its present stage it is
too sane, too conventional, too calculating.
Rather too much like a small child accu-
rately quoting Latin proverbs and repeating
litanies and dogmas, but who has never won-
dered on his own account how the stars
are stuck in the sky, or what the sparrows
say to one another. It is rather a pathetic
precocity. . We have a wide range of excel-
lent artists of all the leading varieties, and
most of them paint well to standard. Other
younger ones are coming on nicely, and are
ready to follow on the lines laid down by
their elders, with naturally some personal
mannerisms of their own. Rut there are
no voices crying in the wilderness, there are
no crack-brained young egotists blurting re-
bellions nonsense or dreaming their lives
away in pursuit of the iridescence, they have
glimpsed in some distant mirage.
Of course, there have been some little
publicity-mongers making a big fuss m an
effort to appear apostolic and different,
uttering commonplace truths and hackneyed
platitudes as though they were their own in-
vention and failing to act up to their own
words. ’ But these noisy little people only
confuse the issue. The men who count in
art in Australia to-day are sincere, gifted
painters for the most part, conscientiously
expressing themselves in accordance with
the manner ol their education. But none
are wild-eyed leaders of forlorn hopes or
persistent prophets of obstinately individual
ideas. Our art is on sound, established lines,
already tested on the other side of the world,
and straightforwardly realistic. As sane and
concrete as a Government Gazette !
Now, this “carry-on” art is good and valu-
able, and, of course, if a man in any walk
of life has nothing special or vividly per-
sonal to say, it is better for him to quote
and respect the best authorities. But m
Australia’s present state of development it is
questionable if such “carry-on” sanity is
desirable. It is natural to expect that with
our lusty physical and mental development
we should shout “I say so!” and “I am
that I am” instead of lazily repeating that
America says so, England tells us so, Pans
orders, Italy insists. The man who gives a
new impetus, who discovers a new point of
view in art, who concentrates upon an en-
tirely original theory, is usually only a little
way removed from the condition of the
.gentleman kept within a walled garden be-
cause he says he is God. The artist must
think himself God for the time being if .he
is going to create. And he is the only kind
of artist who has really counted in the de-
velopment of art. The sane painters follow
and pick up the threads fantastically left
dangling by the eccentrics; but it is the
freaks who originate the threads, as the
spider spins his filaments out of his own
person. Australia is not yet old or effete
enough to amble along contentedly embroider-
ing in flaccid repetition. When there is born
an Australian artist who takes himself seri-
ously enough to look starkly with his own
eyes, with his own unshackled personality,
upon the light and shadow and color and
movement he wants to interpret, no doubt
his technical inefficiency to cope with what
he discovers will bring him to a degree of
madness. But he will leave a freak foot-
print that will be different from the monot-
onous sand-shufflings made by boots all of
similar patterns. And perhaps the queer,
futile shape of it will be developed later into
some beautiful and novel patterns that will
be immortal. Better have Australia horrified
and disturbed by the freaks than that the
shadow of smugness and banal complacency
should creep over us!
If we have no ideas of our own whatever,
and feel no special urge to express vital con-
ceptions through the medium of brush and
chisel better, far better, for us to leave art
alone’for a decade or so. It probably would
be the very best thing that could happen to
Australian art if it were snubbed and ignored
for a spell. The academic type of art would
wilt and fade away in such an atmosphere,
but eventually a few enthusiasts, whose ideas
had been pent up,past bearing, would break
through the bonds in a splendid rebellion.
And out of the maelstrom a soul of our own
should emerge, asserting itself among the
units of aesthetic expression that prevail in
the civilised world.
HATTIE KNIGHT.
Old Australian Rhymes
\ Red Page reference (29/4/'2(i) to the
old song. “Wrap Me up with My Stockwhip
and Blanket” prompts me to send two Aus-
tralian rhymes of tlie early days, dug from
my grandfather’s old album, in which the
dates are from 1843 to 1855. The “Austra-
lian Ditty” was composed by George Mark-
ham, a well-known figure of the early ’fifties,
and is embellished with three scenes of
Australian bush-life, beautifully done in deli-
cate water-color, and surrounded by the
curves of a stockwhip. The history of “The
Stockman’s Last Bed” is given as follows :
The Australian Pastoral Company had a very large
tract of country in the New England district, and
they had many' young Englishmen gaining “Colonial
Experience” on the property. C. E. Bowler [my
grandfather] and the other young bloods composed
this song, and sang it to the air of Dibdin’s “East
Whistle.”
I have heard this poem at various times, with
slight and unimportant differences, and I
wonder if anyone else has an older copy, or
any other explanation of its origin.
The Rt. Hon. George Canning has written
in this book, but there is nothing to show
whether or not he was one of the “young
bloods” on the New England property re-
ferred to.
THE STOCKMAN’S LAST BED.
Whether stockman or not, for one moment give ear,
Poor Jack he is dead, and no more shall we hear
The crack of his whip, or his horse’s sling trot,
llis clear “go-ahead,” or his jingling quart pot.
For he lies where the wattles their sweet fragrance
shed,
And tall gum-trees shadow the stockman’s last bed.
When drafting one day, down came his good horse.
“Alas!” cried poor Jack, “I have run my last course
And never again shall my saddle regain,
Or fleetly bound over the wide-spreading plain.
Oh! hay me where wattles their sweet fragrance
shed,
And tall gum-trees shadow 1 the stockman’s last bed.”
Tlis whip is now silent, his dogs they now mourn,
His horse stands awaiting his master’s return.
Unheeded, uneared for, neglected he died,
Save Australia’s dark children none knows where
he’s laid.
Then, stockmen, if ever on some future day
While following a mob you should happen to stray—
Think of the spot where poor Jack he is laid
Far, far from the home where in childhood he played,
And tread lightly where wattles their sweet fragrance
shed,
And tall gum-trees shadow, and tall gum-trees
shadow
The stockman’s last bed.
AUSTRALIAN DITTY.
(Air, “Come Dwell with Me.”)
Dwell not with me, dwell not with me,
For vour home shall be, your home shall be
A Gunyah cold, by the dark sheepfold,
Beneath the dreary Miall-tree.
Dwell not with me, dwell not with me,
A Damper hard, b.v ashes charr’d,
is all the bushman can afford.
W hile on Sunday you a Cockatoo
Or an “Old Man’s ham’’ may sometimes chew;
Or if perchance you thirsty be
Your drink is jet black milkless tea.
Dwell not with me ! Dwell not with me! !
Dwell not with me, dwell not with me,
For the only spree you’ll ever see
Is a Blackfellows’ fight by the camp firelight
Or perhaps a, chance Corrobberry.
Dwell not with me, dwell not with me!
The Blackfellows dance while the Gins keep time
With their Minnaminna and yabbering rhyme;
While if music-ward your thoughts have strayed,
The Dingo’s ‘howl shall serenade,
Assisted in his melody.
By Goblin Nightbird from a tree.
Dwell not with me ! Dwell not with me ! !
There is another verse; but that may be
taken as sung.
IDA DAWSON.
A Satchel of Books
Ailsa, by F. E. Mills Young (Geoffrey Bles).
Out of the hackneyed situation of the relations
between a second wife and her step-daughter, the
author has evolved an interesting story marked by
careful studies of character.
Sonny, by Virginia Brightman (Geoffrey Bles).
“Sonny” is an Airedale pup condemned to be the
pet of a wealthy New York woman, from whom it
escapes. Its story can be recommended to those
who find interest in gun-men, sheriffs, the American
woman and dogs.
Robin, by Mary Grant Bruce (Angus and Robert-
son). What Ethel Turner is in N. S. Wales Mary
Grant Bruce is in Victoria; and the author of
“Robin” will tighten the hold she already has bv
this brisk, healthy picture of a tomboy girl with
the grit of a man and the heart of a woman.
Payment Deferred, by 0. S. Forester (John Lane).
A sordid tale of how a worried little man meets a
financial crisis by murdering a nephew from Aus-
tralia—we are getting better known —robs him and.
speculating in francs, pulls off a fortune. Not
calculated to raise the spirits on a gloomy day.
A Soul of Sincerity, by “Juliet” (E. A. Vidler).
A story written in Australia, without a trace of
Australian atmosphere, by the author of “God’s
Good Woman,” lately described (R.P. 16/6/’26) as
“Australia’s Ethel M. Dell.” Somewhere, perhaps,
there dwell people like the characters in this un-
pretentious novel —unspoiled beings in a naughty
world.
The Detective’s Holiday by Charles Barry (Meth-
uen). The detective in real life when his holiday
time comes goes fishing. In fiction he solves a
mystery. Detective-Inspector Gilmartin makes a
vacation trip to France, where he becomes in-
volved in a search for the murderer of an English-
man, and once on the trail he carries the reader
on to midnight.
Cameragraphs (Harrington). A pictorial record
of the Australian Salon of Photography’s second
annual show, held at Farmer’s (Sydney) recently.
Sixty beautifully-balanced compositions are repro-
duced, and Harold Cazneaux, who can get poetry
even out of Mort’s Dock, contributes an appreciative
foreword.
Courts and Camps in India, by Yvonne Fitzroy
(Methuen). A record of frankly superficial im-
pressions. The author was for four years a mem-
ber of the vice-regal household in India while
Lord Reading was Viceroy, and had thus an oppor-
tunity of seeing from within the ceremonial and
picturesque aspects of British rule in the Last.
The book adds little to one’s solid knowledge of
India, but conveys some local color.
Pearson’s Guide Boole and Hoad Map of A. S.
Wales. One of the difficulties that confront those
who seek to explore the Ma State without recourse
to the railways is to sort out the roads that lead
somewhere from those that don’t. J. Pearson, who
has spent a lifetime investigating the matter has
brought up to date his very clear and understandable
charts and equally lucid letterpress. No motorist
roving further afield from Sydney than Parramatta
should spurn Pearson’s aid.
The Zoo Murder, by Francis D. Grierson (Geoff-
rey Bles). When Professor Wells accompanied a
Harley-street surgeon to the Zoo, where the latter
held a post-mortem examination of a diseased lion
and found in the noble beast’s “guts,” as the pro-
fessional gentleman put it, one of the bones of a
human spine, he started the learned Professor oil
a well-worn path. The narrative runs the usual
detective-story course, with the Professor on the
scent, and an amazing crime is disclosed.
Your Home, by T. G. Barbour (Bookstall Co- ).
This handbook gives advice to property buyers and
tells them how to protect their interests when
purchasing. A pretty wallpaper and a polished
floor may cover a multitude of sins. How to arm
oneself against the jerry-builder and the restorer of
defective shacks is the main object, and the writer
gives an architect’s views on the essentials of a
well-built, comfortable and sanitary home. There
is a summary, too, of legal points to be considered
before concluding a purchase.
Science Propress (John Murray). This quarterly
contains a paper on “The Industrial Measurement of
Color.” For commercial purposes a method of comput-
ing color is greatly needed. At present we have no
simple means of measurement; in fact, nothing but
the crude method of submitting an actual sample
is found capable of securing accuracy. There
exists no universal standard. The same name is
given to quite different shades and tints. If
science can evolve a standard of comparison for
reflected color and also for original color, simple to
use, a definite industrial advance will be made.
The writer believes it to be within the grasp of
science, and already some of the groundwork has
been done.
♦
“S.T.S.” : The work of the Queensland “society for
investigating the origins of place-names” (R.P.
17/6/’26) has been done almost entirely in South
Aus. by one man, Rodney Cockburn. Shortly before
the war he published a long series of Register
articles on the subject. The men who had allotted
the names were mostly still available, and they
responded with a flood of suggestions and amend-
ments : thus, when he came to publish in book
form, he had any quantity of material that should
be authoritative.
“C.M.” : In the course of a discussion on willow-
pattern rhymes, John o’ London’s (10/4/’26) prints
a letter from an injudicious thief named J. Arnold
Fleming, who enclosed, without acknowledging their
authorship and with several verses distorted, David
McKee Wright’s Bulletin poem on the subject
(B. 26/10/’22). Fleming adds that he has included
these stanzas, considered by potters to be the best
(they are, too), in his lately published volume on
Scottish Pottery. He might at the same time have
given John o’ London’s the correct version and
added that an Australian was responsible for the
loveliest lines on Chinese blue and white that col-
lectors know.

PACKARD SINGLE-SIX FIVE-PASSENGER PHAETON
Packard Achievement
BEHIND the Packard there is all the experience of more
than twenty-five years of motor car manufacturing - a
vivid story of pioneering and ultimate achievement. The first
Packard was built by a rich man as a hobby from which has
grown the great organisation of to-day. The best of material
was always available and was always used, and as Packard has
never known poverty, it never learned to substitute or cut cor-
ners. Packard has always protected the owner by maintaining
a standard design and by refraining from offering yearly
models. With the occupation of new premises in William
Street, Packard now offers the advantage of reduced prices.
The Packard Single-Six five-passenger Phaeton illustrated
above is sold at a price which makes it ideal for the man who
wants a fine car at a moderate outlay.

Big Propellers.
“Something I want to ask you fellers,
The old man said as he quaffed his beer—
“Talkin’ o’ steamers and new propellers
An’ turbine-engines and fancy gear,
Answer me this. When you double-whack
her,
Squirtin’ yer oil by the ton to burn,
How could you stop her quick and back her
With those egg-flip blades that the tur-
bines turn ?
“Sailorin’ since I was just a nipper,
Mate in sail and master in steam —
Emigrant ship and China clipper.
Out and home from the Ports o' Dream—
Ail I'd ask for is big propellers —
Three full fathom from tip to tip—
Something to hold when a tog-gun hellers,
When yer little blades would spin and slip.
“Blacker than thunder at one that mornin',
Swingin’ her round by Columbia Shoal,
With nothin’ at all to give us warnin'
But a landward joggle that made her roll,
Sudden the lookout yelled ‘Hard over !
The Big King blacker'n Hell ahead!’
What was it checked her all standing and
hove her
Back in her tracks and stopped her dead?
"Big propellers it was! No other
Human gear could have saved the ship.
Kicking up foam in a roarin’ smother.
We rang ‘Astern !’ and we let ’em rip.
That’s what I wanted to tell you fellers —
Talkin' about your fancy gear—
Give me a ship with big propellers.
An’ show me’ a course that I dare not
stnpi' !”

WILL LAWSON.
Tired Waves.
The waves roll on beneath the sullen rains
Line after line, implacable as fate,
Not swift like snuffing steeds with wind-
tossed manes,
Nor gay like dancing-girls with skirts of
foam,
But tired and slow, with weakness in their
gait,
Like old white-bearded men that shuffle
home!

MYRA MORRIS.
Chant of the Hyacinth Fleet.
Here’s up now and out now
And away now to be,
With a strong heart and stout now,
In the north countree,
In the fair land, the rare land,
The land that calls to me
When the purple ships are launching
For the wide,' wide sea.
Here green held and fallow,
Here Ray bank and tree
And still deep and shallow
Are crowding in to see,
By shy lands, and high lands
And all lands that be
The purple-crested islands
Go drifting out to sea,
Go sailing and trailing
To the wide, wide sea,
By the green, green willow
And the tall gum-tree.
So up now, and out now,
And away now to be,
With a strong heart and stout now,
In the north countree!
With a hoping, a groping.
A praying to be free
As the purple ships a-riding
To the wide, wide sea.

CECIL MANN.
Maroochy River.
Far away by Maroochy River,
By the scrubs and the ridges wide,
The west winds sway through the gum-
boughs grey
By the sheen of the sun-kissed tide.
This is the hope that my heart has taught
her,
Careless of when or how:
Just to go back to the broad bright water,
Back to the brown ways now.
All along by Maroochy River
The flowers of the garlands spill.
Each wilding vagrant unnamed and fragrant
By hollow and slope and hill.
The bush birds gather when shades are
falling
Over the uplands slow ;
It’s ever so long since I heard them calling,
Ever so long ago !
Shimmers the haze on Maroochy River,
Silver and gold together,
By fern and frondage in sunny bondage
Alt in the lazy weather.
There’s magic out on the marshes lonely,
The swamps and the still lagoons,
The waste lands wide where the reeds sigh
only
Under the drowsy noons.
I’ll go back to Maroochy River
Some of these long, long days.
Out of the strife to the old bush life
Back to the old bush ways.
Comes a call with a clear insistence
Drawing my dreams amain.
Over the plains and the purple distance
Back to the North again !
Shall I find by Maroochy River
Lethe and long, long rest?
Though life be sweet where the wide ways
meet
Yet the clear blue hills are best.

PROVINCIALISM SCENTS A VICTORY.
Ajx the State Premiers and most of the
editors of Great Dailies have persuaded
themselves that the public, though outwardly
calm, is in a frightful state of indignation
at the Bruce Government’s plans for the
extension ©f Commonwealth powers and the
readjustment of Federal and State finance.
With one voice they declare that when the
electors vote on the suggested Constitutional
amendments, which, it is alleged, have been
“rusted** on them—though similar proposals
were submitted in 1011, 1013 and 1010, and
discussed on divers occasions in between
Bruce will get the shock of his life. The
cry has been taken up by the stalwarts of
State A.UP. executives and Business Men’s
Leagues ; in fact, the whole motley band of
generals in the Mexican Army of Provin-
cialism are prematurely shouting, “for a
mighty victory is won.” Still, there aro a
few sceptics and strikers of discordant notes
although they .can hardly make themselves
heard m the din. W. M. Hughes, for in-
stance, That gentleman laughs in his impish
the State Governments’ “arrogance
o, all the virtues.” He recalls that in 1935
■when he was Prime Minister, the six Govern-
ments undertook to give the Commonwealth
industrial powers “sufficient for our pur-
poses,” and five shamelessly repudiated the
agreement. “I have discussed these matters
with _the State Premiers on at least four
occasions, he says, “and my experience was
distinctly unfortunate:—
I draw no distinction, in this regard, between
1 rcmiers representing Labor States and Premiers
Nationalist States. They were all tarred
with the one brush. They put forward a hundred
reasons why they should not be dethroned; why
their splendid majesty should not be tarnished;
why they should not be pushed a little from the
centre of the stage in order that we might get sortie
foothold upon it. But for the happy circumstance
that the High Court found that the Defence power of
the Commonwealth was like the widow’s cruse,
Parliament would have passed through its severest
ordeal hampered and fettered bv the dog-in-the-
manger conduct of the State authorities.”
During the war, Hughes adds, the people
didn’t care two straws for State rights, and
lie doubts whether they care any more now.
* * * ‘ *
Circumstances have made Matthew
Charlton the most interesting figure of the
referendum campaign. Braving the wrath
of the N. S. Wales A.L.P. executive, which
ordered the 11 Ma State Federal members
to oppose everything, the member for Hunter
has issued a manifesto recommending trade
unionists to vote for the amendments relating
to industrial powers, companies, and “trusts
and combinations in restraint of trade,”
unions included. The manifesto has been
additionally signed by Blakeley, M.H.Il. for
Darling, and the courage of both men is to
be admired, for the State Labor bosses have
means of sacrificing them, notwithstanding
that the Federal Labor executive has given
them a free hand. Blakeley, moreover, is
a member of the A.W.U., the N.S.W. heads
ot which are bitterly denouncing the amend-
ments, although they supported them in the
past. The authors of the manifesto affirm
that, were they “to oppose grants of power
which we have warmly advocated for 16
years merely because the proposals now ema-
nate from political opponents, we would he
unworthy of our great movement.” They
point out that the Labor platform declares
for unlimited legislative powers for the
Commonwealth Parliament and such dele-
gated powers to the States or Provinces as
the Commonwealth Parliament may deter-
mine,” and lay stress on the immense losses
that the federated unions have suffered owing
to the limitation of Commonwealth indus-
trial powers, the artificial disputes that have
had to be created in order to get cases heard
by the Federal Arbitration Court, which can-
not deal with grievances not “extending be-
yond the limits of any one State,” and the
enormous difficulties that have arisen from
the Court s inability to establish a common
rule. Regarding industrial powers, com-
panies and trusts and combines, their facts,
generally speaking, are unassailable and their
arguments sound. But on the proposal to
empower the Commonwealth to “protect the
interests of the public in case of actual or
probable interruption of any essential ser-
vice, ’ feeling the necessity of making some
concession to the bosses who threaten their
political heads, they recommend their fol-
lowers to vote No. They contend, very
weakly, that such a power might be abused.
Their words on the other issues are a suffici-
ent answer:—
The Commonwealth Parliament in the only National
meet in the British Empire that does not
possess these powers. Are we to declare that the
Australian Parliament should be denied powers already
possessed hy the Parliament of Maoiiland V
Charlton points out. and Hughes regrets,
that Bruce is not trying to secure the
unlimited trade-and-commerce powers sought
in 1931 and 1918. Bruce should certainly
have gone the whole hog, and just as cer-
tainly should Page aim at a permanent
settlement of the outstanding financial ques-
tions—such a settlement as will provide for
a complete, separation of taxation fields, the
Commonwealth retaining the income-tax and
using it solely for war charges, and the
Federalising of State debts —instead of an
arrangement which, though an improvement
on the present muddle, will have to be re-
viewed in a year or two. The Government
is over-fond of compromises and lacks the
crusading spirit. All the same, it does
stand in its fashion for Nationalism against
Provincialism—for the ideal of a great
country sustained by a strong Common-
wealth against that of a loose collection of
improvident colonies, each a law to itself in
matters which concern all.
HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN GO ON
THE LAND?
The craving of the Foreign-trader—the pro-
fessional and often hired discourager of
Australian manufactures—to put people on
the land is the same intense emotion as the
desire of the professional disturber to put
them into a union and then haul them out on
strike. In fact, the professional disturber
shows such energy in his efforts to stop this
country's factory production, and make the
way clear for imports, that it has been sug-
gested that he receives both funds and in-
structions from Foreign-trade quarters. It
is one of the features of Australian life,
this passionate clamor that all and sundry
should rush headlong on to the soil and
‘settle’—a clamor that is accompanied by
the assurance that vast areas are just aching
tor the plough, varied by the crv that farmers
are going around in droves seeking available
earth and finding none; wherefore some
malign influence must be at work.
* * * *
The amount of land in the world, apart
from deserts and frozen regions, is apt to
be over-estimated, like the size of the alleged
fortunes which are in Chancery and await-
ing claimants. England and Wales, of
course, with more than one human being to
the acre, and that acre largely occupied by
lion-agricultural objects, has no gross illn-
sions about depositing surplus folk on the
sou. Nor has Scotland, with 41 acres per
inhabitant, a- remarkable proportion of them
rock. But in Ireland, till the crest insur-
rection which had its beginning in 1916 and
its ending at an indefinite date, a very
extensive conviction existed that there was
land enough to go round—somewhere. The
Irishman, like his fellow Celts in Wales,
the Scottish Highlands, Cornwall, Brittany
and Man, never developed the manufacturing
instinct very strongly, but he alwavs had a
strong attachment to the earth, and to agri-
cultural or pastoral ways. The great reform,
which began in earnest about 1885, was
expected not only to relieve the Irish farmer
O' ais rack-renting landlord and inaugurate
an era of prosperity, but in some way to
make farms available so that an indefinite
number of people might go on the laud and
share the prosperity. By 1916. when the
pi elimmary row began, the old, big. oppres-
sive owner had nearly disappeared. Even the
man with 500 acres was approaching his

o (_,Ulo settlers, of whom nearly two-thirds
were owners, while the rest were to a con-
siderable extent the tenants of new owners,
who had already gone u-1 andlording. The
farms averaged some 28 acres each, being
about 18 acres permanent grass and 10
acres cultivation. The largest category of
occupants consisted of-men with less than
hve acres (most of this crowd, 156,707
strong had less than one acre), while the
over-500-acre men were a mere fraction.
A great reform had been nearly completed,
rnu ™ere was no agricultural millennium.
Ihe revolutionary force which devastated so
much of the island was made up of many
elements, among them being men with star-
vation farms and men with no farms at
ail and a fierce sense of injury. The posi-
tion of the latter was almost worse than
e days, for a great subdivision act
rni came and gone, and they were out of it.

ence isn t so tremendous. Taking S. Aus-
tralia as an example, that State possesses an
area with a loin, rainfall which is equal to
acres per inhabitant, including the in-
habitants who are on it already. Of that
not-wildly-riotous bit of space only 17 acres
have more than a 20in. rainfall, and these
acres arc cumbered with towns, roads and
other obstructions. A community so situated
would be ill-advised to throw itself unani-
mously on the bosom of the earth. Victoria

better situated, and so is Tasmania, yet they
are hardly the colossal affairs which dreamers
picture them. The regulation closer-settle-
ment inspiration is to chase sheep off the
suirace and put human beings on, to grow
wheat or something of the sort, because many
more humans can thus be shoved on a given
space. But Australia can't afford to kill off
its biggest and most reliable article of ex-
port even if tile result is an increase in a
smaller item with a violent wobble in it.
It can go too far in the way of discouraging
an article which is worth 2s. a pound, and
which pays the N.S.W. railways 295. per
011 freight per 100 miles (an immense
profit), m order to do a greater trade in an
article worth about Id. a pound, and with a
man whose principal goods are convoyed at 8s
od„ os 2d. and 6s. 4d. per ton per 100 miles
respectively (an immense loss), especially as
he is said to be unable to pay more. Mixed
tarming is a favorite nostrum of the day.
But it wasn’t the small mixed mail who
made the Australian jumbuck what it is ;
rather was it the individual who could buv
pedigree stock to breed from. It is very
doubtful if the high-grade sheen is the in-
dividual small man’s animal, though small
men might incorporate themselves in com-
panies and pursue him with unlimited
success. In any case, mixed farming requires
too much laud to really qualify as that
petted institution, really close settlement.
It is doubtful if there is, or. is ever likely
to be, such a thing as successful close settle-
ment except where the agricultural mid
pustoial business is largely interspersed with
manufacturing industry. In some instances,
w here the new farmer was small as well
as the farm a quarter of his weight in
borrowed gold has been invested before he
was planted, and very often he didn’t take
'■oot It is a side-issue that the more settle-
ment there is the more land there is fhai
must not be settled unless the community pro-
poses to lay up great trouble for the future,
in other words, the more people there are
the more unpeopled space is required to pro-
vide a timber supply. In 1928-24 this
country paid away almost the value of its
butter exports in the purchase of boards and
planks from foreigners, and gave them a
great deal in addition for paper. The
P oieign-trade idea of “the land” and purely
agricultural encampment thereon as a pan-
acea for human ills is far from the simple
business it is represented. Still there is
much human interest in the subject, and
as pursued during recent years, much in-
human swindle.
A RED FOOL AT GENEVA.
One George Lawson, who went from
Queensland to the International Labor Con-
ference at Geneva last year, returned home
with a high opinion of that polyglot debat-
ing society, pronouncing it “of paramount
importance to the people of the world.” He
frankly admitted ’ that the discussions
brought no direct material advantage to
the woikeis of Australia, whose represen-
tative he was, but explained (without ex-
plaining Jus explanation) that “a great deal
o* benefit must accrue indirectly as the
result of such legislation being put into
operation by the less advanced countries
which wiU mean the levelling up of all social
legislation, thereby eliminating unfair com-
petition of the international markets.” In
much dess misty language Mr. Lawson sup-
?no^ d A tho suggestion of John Curtin, the
in„4 Australian Labor delegate, that the
three or four Commonwealth men at the con-
ference should be supplied with “advisers”
and a stenographer and typist, all at the
cost ot the Australian taxpayer; and in re-
cording with indignation that Joe Cook and
J. McNeil, the employers’ delegate, were
against him on some of tlie questions raised,
the Brisbane gentleman advised the State
onernments to "direct the Commonwealth
Government to instruct the delegates to all
ruture conferences to vote and voice the
opimon, of the majority of the Australian
►states. ( onsidering that wage-payers have

minorities, Mr. Lawson is pretty

he reported, “lias a staff of 800
4%iA non”' officials, an appropriation of
xouo.uuu p.a., and a yearly conference, which
must have some work put- before it” ; but “the
use and success of the whole organisation is
problematical.” He recalled that the United
States summoned the first International
Labor Conference in 1919. but, “having evi-
dently seen enough of the game” on that
occasion, has not joined the International
naiior organisation—“perhaps the USA
was wise m its decision.” The 48-liour week!
vtri- was a § reed to with cheers at that
\\ asliington Conference, has been ignored by
many of the associated countries, together
with nearly all the high-sounding resolu-
adopt?d at Geneva. In the result,
McNeil points out, “considerable discon-
tent is being engendered.” In fact:—
in^i n^ national I -i 1 I bor . office is llot always an
influence for peace, either internal or international,
it may easily become the opposite.
Cabled accounts of the Australian Labor
delegates proceedings at the 1926 meeting
show that McNeil judged wisely. The dele-
gate m question is Jack Beasley, a typical
product of the Sydney Trades and Labor
Council, that nursery of Moscow pilgrims
and mischievous blatherskites. Trailing liis
coat fro™ the outset, Beasley “strongly
attacked the administration of the Labor
Office, which, lie said, should “aim at the
creation of social justice,” and scolded the
Other delegates for not doing more to pro-
vent war. The workers of Australia recog-
nised, lie said “that the next war would
Pe in the Pacific zone, and had convened a
conference of workers, to be held at Hono-
lulu, to see what action should be taken by
organised Labor to combat the menace.”
in reply he was drily informed that he was
confusing the Labor Office with the League
ot Nations, whose business it was to pre-
vent war—the Labor Office was concerned
only with industry. Undeterred by this
rebuke, the foolish young man, who is viru-
lently anfa-Pascist, fell foul of the Italian
c. ( legation. The Italians having tabled an
amendment. to a motion regarding the im-pec-
tmn of emigrants, the Sydney Red accused
them of putting it forward to wreck the
whole scheme, or else of being “actuated
b,\ a motive known only to the Italian Gov-
ernment lie is likewise reported to have
said that the workers’ representatives must
view the (.Italian ! pronosal with grave sus-
picion because of the forms of organisation

intervened with “a strong protest against
Mr Beasleys insinuations,” and a reminder
mat tor cine associated country to object to
another s ‘forms of organisation.” which was
purely its own business, was an impertinence,
for this he was thanked by the leader of
lie Italian delegation, who said he would
have carried the matter farther” if the

* * *
Hie Commonwealth Government should
give serious attention to the performances
o! its nominee. It can’t afford to send Red
too s to Lurope to embitter its relations with
Italy. \\ hetlier the Fascist form of govern-
ment is guod or bad, the Fascist Govern-
ments attitude to this country has been uni-
formly correct. Moreover, while Russia, the
Red fools paradise, bought £46 worth of

tomeis In 1.L4-_5 it purchased Australian
tlle val v° wf £10,014,186, which was
£860,000 more than the value exported even
to the L.S.A. Next to the United Kingdom,
Italy is our nnneipal foreign market for
wheat (it took £5,384.520 worth in 1924-
2o), and buyers of Australian wheat are not
so numerous that we are in a position to let
vain and ignorant mob-orators alienate the
second-best. Had the Italian kingdom gone
Bolsh, as our Red fools hoped it would, its
trade with Australia would have ceased as
Russia’s has ceased; neither would it have
entered upon the repayment of its debt to
Britain, thereby indirectly benefiting this
country. In short, the Australian Govern-
ment has nothing to gain and a great deal
to lose by antagonising Italy. It can’t
stop the Rod fools from throwing mud at
Mussolini in Australia, but it can stop
them from aggravating the offence at inter-
national assemblies which they attend at the
expense of the Australian taxpayer, and it
wiH he stark, staring mad if it doesn't ston
them. W bile Australia may find it expedi-
ent to belong to tlie League of Nations, it
is not bound to send delegations to the
Intoriiatioiial Lubor Coiiferopcc, from which
a dozen or more League members are always
absent (a number don t pay their contribu-
tions), and no more delegations should be
sent.
A NATION OF WOWSERS.
“The world should thank Australia for that
word ‘wowser,’” said Innis ; and he re-
peated my definition : “ ‘A wowser is a person
who stops other people enjoying themselves
in their own way, that being his way of
enjoying himself.’ Here you have the
spectacle of a whole land of wowsers,” and
he indicated with a wave of the hand the


peninsula of India, which, so to speak, lay
at our back door.
This seaport town was more than typical
of India ; it was an epitome of all the world,
for on it broke waves of faith from East
and West. It was Good Friday, and the day
happened to coincide with a native festival.
The furnaces of religion were in full blast!
We passed the churches, chapels and cathe-
drals of a dozen Christian denominations.
Ayahs were playing with their charges out-
side in the sun while the parents worshipped
within. The wealthy Tamil moneylenders
had motored down from their mansions like
museums to their own special temple like a
Stone-Age man’s cave, where, nearly naked,
they were bathing and garlanding the sacred
cow. We watched frantic devotees sweating-
toddy and trying to disentangle the car of
some god whom they were dragging from his
suburban residence to a city shrine, and who
had got his head mixed with the electric-light
wires. Innis did not know the deity’s name.
He was liberal-minded for a British Govern-
ment official, but he confessed that his know-
ledge of the 400 million personages of the
Hindu pantheon was incomplete.
We passed a Burmese wat gay with gold
paint staring with emulation across the road
at a Siamese wat, also gay with gold paint.
A temple to Kali-ma, the exceedingly un-
pleasant spouse of Siva, flashed by upon the
right. We caught a glimpse of a dark in-
terior and curling incense-smoke. Two
hundred millions worship this unusual lady
with her 12 arms, her necklace of human
skulls, her protruding tongue dripping blood
and her waist belt of severed hands which
is her sole covering. She is the Preserver,
with six arms to embrace you ; likewise the
Destroyer, with six to crush you. She is
the.sex incarnate, the symbol of spawning
tropical life and of swift dissolution, the
emblem of reckless procreation about which
the Rev. Malt nus once wrote a warning
which India will be the last to heed. Kali-
ma’s appetites are bloody, but Innis and
his confreres, who are absurdly nice about
the sacredness of human life, have fobbed
her off of late years with goats instead of
little children, although the latter are far the
cheaper. Nevertheless, there is still some-
thing sinister about her temples. In them
there is no congregational worship. The
devotees enter alone and suspicious of each
other, utter their mysterious prayers and
register their dubious vows, departing with a
crimson, a yellow or a white brand upon
their foreheads like a patent for fresh vil-
lainies.
We got down at a barred gateway set in
a lofty wall above which poked up a writh-
ing mass of arms and legs, bare breasts and
paunches, like a ’bus-load of gods and god-
desses reduced to confusion by a street
collision. It was the familiar pyramid of a
Hindu temple. From inside came sudden
shouts, a babble of voices, the rattling of
chains and inexplicable quaking silences.
Only once a year are the secrets of this
sacred arsenal disclosed. Then, provided he
is in evening-dress, the European may enter
and confront the central mystery. We were
jostled by priests, half in the buff, and by
wholly drunken worshippers. Fierce glances,
with a note of triumph in them, were cast
at us. Not all men are equal before India’s
gods. A clerk in Innis’s office, fresh from
Oxford, addressed Innis with condescension.
He was stripped to the waist, garlanded with
flowers, and smelt of cheap perfume. The
smell of incense, crushed blossoms and per-
spiring bodies choked us. The vast pillared
building was moist and hot and dark as a
ca've. We could not see. Innis’s boot
crunched on something soft that moved. He
shuddered. He had trampled on the hand
of a child sleeping on the ground. The
entire temple floor was carpeted with tangled
bodies. They lay prone in every attitude,
exhausted by drink and devotion.
At the end of a long vista of columns like
the legs of stumpy and dropsical giants we
approached the central mystery. Devotees
surged round it in an ecstasy of adoration
over the bodies of women and children fast
asleep. A man was beating his forehead.
Another was shouting at the top of his voice.
A Sikh policeman, a man of an alien faith,
stood at the side of the shrine, imperturbable
and mutely scornful amidst the holy riot. A
priest liung a garland of sweet-smelling
flowers round our necks, drenched our clothes
with scent, and a score of hands lay hold
of us and dragged us, like sacrifices, to the
foot of the' altar to confront the god. There
was nothing there. Only a small aperture
with a smoky lamp set in it, and the flame,
blown about by hundreds of breaths, rising
and falling like blood in a heart. “They
worship a Tlniversal Abstract Principle,”
explained Innis ; “but it didn’t prevent them
pulping a few Islams last year because they
showed irreverence to some consecrated
monkeys.”
We went out and climbed a hill, passing
numerous tiny Mohammedan surau, like
sentry boxes set up by the Prophet in readi-
ness for the Jihid, which is to sweep the
infidel into the sea. It was the time for even-
ing prayer. In one mosque the faithful were
standing with hands raised above their heads :
in the next they were lying with their heads
in the dust; but from all went up that fierce
chant of Islam :
When the stunning sound of the trumpet shall
be heard, on that day shall a man fly from his brother,
and his mother, and' his father, and his wife and his
children. On that day the faces of some shall' be
bright, laughing and joyful; and upon the faces of
others, on that day, shall there be dust; darkness
shall cover them. These are the unbelievers, the
wicked.
The hill was crowned by a Chinese temple.
A great golden Buddha looked gently
through half-shut eyes at the lights coming
out in the city far below. I made some
remark about the chances of the new panthe-
istic creed evolved mainly by American Theo-
sophists welding the jarring factions into
some form of Buddhism.
“Old Buddha hasn’t a hope,” commented
Innis. “There are still fighting races up
in the mountains. As soon as we English
idiots withdraw they will come down and
separate the. loving Indian from his own or
his loving brother’s throat.”
Going home we passed a disturbance up
a side street. “It’s started,” remarked
Innis. “Some earnest Moslem has spat on
the sacred cow. Thank the Lord I’m not
in the police! A: nation of wowsers!” he
added sadly.
FENG-SHOI.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Twenty-two Dead Men.
Replying to F. M. Forde, Labor member
for Caprieornia, the other day, Pratten,
who administers the Navigation Act, said of
the Dorrigo inquiry that “the information
obtained by the Court on the distribution of
weights in the vessel was presumably not
sufficiently definite to enable any useful ques-
tion as to the vessel’s stability to be put to
naval architects.'’ He was badly prompted,
as the Court thought it had sufficient evi-
dence—useful and other sorts —to find that
“the cargo was well and securely stowed
below hatches by experienced stevedores in
the ordinary way, and the deck cargo was
securely lashed.” Accepting that conclusion, if
the cargo was well and securely stowed and
lashed “in the ordinary way,” and 22 lives
were lost nevertheless, the matter is one. not
for less but for more inquiry; for it is a
confession that “the ordinary way” may be
associated with very fatal results. How-
ever, it is not the conclusions of thfe Court
that interest The Bulletin very much:
what is wanted is that a competent naval
architect should take the facts as they are
known and try to figure out how it was that
22 men were drowned. It would not be all
loss if their going indicated how further
wholesale drownings can be avoided.
Pratten said that the officers who had
charge of the stowage in Brisbane, were lost
in the ship, so their evidence perished with
them. But unstable ships have not yet man-
aged to drown the wharf staffs, so that the
stevedores at both Brisbane and Sydney
might throw a ray of light on the subject.
By starting at Sydney, and ascertaining how
the through cargo for ports beyond Bris-
bane was stowed, this would narrow the in-
vestigation down to the stowage of the cargo
from Brisbane for northern ports. It should
also be possible to ascertain how much of
the timber—-on top of which flour in bags
was stowed—was pine. If there was much
of this it would be like inverting the plans
of a skyscraper and bqildi,ng the top storey
first. Proceeded with along proper lines,
there is wonderful scope for profitable in-
vestigation ; but the matter has got to be
regarded as having some importance, and
so long as Pratten “presumes” that his
Court did its work along proper and scien-
tific lines, and based its finding upon
sound premises and known facts —not-
withstanding the points that have since been
raised—there does not seem to be much
hope of having it regarded in that light.
Other weight was taken out of the bottom,
according to the manager of the firm which
overhauled the Dorrigo in the early part of
the year—“a certain amount of cement, which
never , should have been in.” But previous
owners might have taken this method of
getting weight into the bottom and protect-
ing the insides of the ballast and water-tanks
at the sarnie time. Further, the master in
evidence stated that some tons of ashes were
dumped. If these were taken from the stoke-
hold-plates, they also shifted weight from
where it was vitally needed. Also, the coal
used from the time she left the wharf until
she submerged would also come from the
bottom of the bunkers. Until enough coal
was used to cause it to run down from the
upper bunkers, the Dorrigo would be con-
suming her own stability with every shovel-
ful of coal burned. At its best, the Dorrigo
disaster is a smudgy incident in the shipping
annals of Australia. It is only made
smudgier by the finding that the vessel was
loaded “in the ordinary way.” How is it
that vessels which pass the Navigation offi-
cers can be loaded “in the ordinary way”
and yet drown 22 men in a fair sea and mod-
erate weather? Surely that is something
worth finding out.

Is Australian Wool Deteriorating?
“Trepex” : The Australian woolgrower has
enough genuine faults: it is unnecessary to
try to fasten on him fictitious ones. Of
course, there are those who buy, breed and
feed cheap jumbucks, with the eternal hope
of selling them or their produce as good
stuff. But these are not typical; on the
whole, our pastoralists are progressive in
the matter of their main product, even if
they are going too much in one direction.
But to designate a very pronounced advance-
ment along a particular line as “deteriora-
tion” is a perversion of language. Aus-
tralian sheep-men, by application to their
business, have evolved a type of bulky,
deeply-grown, shafty wool which is of
medium and medium-to-strong quality. In
its class it is one of the very best pro-
ducts of the world; and, though some people
may consider it too much developed in one
direction, it maintains a positive path of
advancement. Until Australia began grow-
ing merino wool, the world shuffled along
in crossbred or longwool clothes, and was
well content with them. The merino wool
was reserved for special fabrics at special
prices, and the price of the raw material
was correspondingly special. No wonder
Macarthur was encouraged. In 1821 some
of his wool brought 10s. Id. per lb. But this
sort of thing did not last long. When
Australia began growing large quantities of
merino wool, the price fell away amazingly,
and during the period of the biggest produc-
tion of the really fine article it varied from
Bd. to 4d. per lb. The world began to go
casually to work then in merinos. Naturally,
when our growers found the prices so much
lower, they looked to increase the volume.
This could not and cannot be done to any
marked extent while keeping the quality fine.
So the quality had to broaden. Then, to
the amazement of all, the grower found his
price per lb. had not fallen. Times had
changed and manufacturing costs had in-
creased. so medium-quality wool, of good
length, bulk and density, which could be eco-
nomically handled and which gave a stout,
warp thread, was as valuable as the more
expensively handled finer staple which made
a not very much superior article. It is
only the foreigners, with their lower wages
and lower standard of living, who can handle
the very fine wool economically and now de-
mand it in any quantity. But they want it at
the same price as the other. True, the sale-
room sees buyers springing out for an occa-
sional line which is so regular in quality
that it can go straight on to the machines;
but the lots that require sorting leave these
hne-wool searchers comparatively cold. They
ask for an evenness of classification that
they get from no other wool-producers in the
world, and certainly not from. the
S’Africans, who are notorious for the irregu-
larity of their packing. Also, it will be noted
that they do not pay their longest prices for
the longest descriptions of wool, and, there-
fore, from the sheep which cut the most.
These fine wools can be too long; they like
’em short. In other words, they like the
wool from the sheep from which the least
quantity is shorn. What is the sense of
giving it to them under these conditions?
It does not pay us to do so, and the threat
of rivalry from other countries is really not
frightening. South Africa and South America
are not going to miss the lessons we have
had to learn. Already we kpow that the
S’Africans, who come over here to buy our
rams, take the strongest-woolled varieties they
can get. Studbreeders took to working up
special lines of such sheep for their custom.
These shrewd buyers had found that they
could not maintain weight and density and
also fine quality at the same time, and that
the best of the three to sacrifice was the
fine quality. Moreover, they had learnt, as
we had, that the finer-woolled sheep are the
weaker-constitutioned, the smaller-framed
and the most difficult to look after. If the
S’Africans are showing a little disposition
to modify their earlier demand for strong
wools, it is in order to correct a previous
extreme. Our own policy is right; only we
are carrying it too far, perhaps. A big, bold
strong staple is a good one, but a straight-
fibred one is not; and there is more than
a suspicion of straightness in some of our
standard clips to-day. But let us beware
of calling a high development of special char-
acteristics by the name of “deterioration.”
Protection and Some Queer Figures.
Earle Page’s talk about lifting Aus-
tralian manufacturing industry to the point
at which it will export half its output and,
incidentally, redeem this continent’s soul
from the pawnshop has struck no responsive
chord in the breast of A. Vickery, of the
Stockowners’ Defence Association, who has
been writing to prove that Page is a villain
of the deepest dye. Stripped of a cloying
accumulation of words, Vickery’s indict-
ment of Page boils down to the following
allegations:—
1. That the cost of collecting £37,192,781 of
Customs duties last year was “one-half of this huge
sum.”
2. That “in a normal family of five persons,
Commonwealth taxation last year amounted to no
less than £63 Bs. 4d.”
3. That if the time ever arrives when Australia
exports half its manufactured products, something
terrible will happen to civil servants and bank and
insurance clerks, “whose incomes cannot be made to
barometrically move with the caprice of our would-
be tariff farmers.”
Taking Vickery's points seriatim, he is
dead wrong about number one. The cost of
collecting the sum he mentions (which was
Customs and excise, by the way, and not
Customs duties only) was not one-half of
the duty, but less than one-seventieth, if the
Commonwealth Statistician is a witness of
truth. As to No. 2, the burden or incidence
of Commonwealth taxation, as a whole, is
irrelevant. But it wouldn’t have looked
nearly so impressive to say that the Cus-
toms and excise duties last year amounted
to an average of about £6 per head, and
wasn’t distributed as evenly as that because
of the big proportion that was levied on
such luxuries as motor-cars, expensive rai-
ment and costly wines. As to Point 3,
Vickery is a bit obscure. He doesn’t pre-
tend to show how a state of industrial pro-
ductivity in which so much would be pro-
duced, and at so cheap a rate, that an over-
seas market could be found for half of it
would injure the bank-clerk, the insurance-
clerk or the civil servant. Nor does he sug-
gest that banking, insurance and the
machinery of government would disappear
owing to the failure of these avenues of in-
dustry to yield those engaged in them a fair
return for their services. He just makes
a vague remark, and lets it go at that.
Vickery professes to laugh heartily at
Page’s idea that a national debt can be
wiped out or reduced by buying less abroad
and making more at home, but he isn’t bold
enough to suggest an alternative way of
securing the same result. Indeed, his refer-
ences to economic doctrines on the subject
would lead one to think he supposes that
every country on earth either is in debt or
has an exact balance of accounts with
foreign lands. Actual credits, such as Uncle
Samuel commands, don’t seem to him pos-
sible.
Allan Meets the Enemy.
Victorian Premier Allan’s policy speech
contained too little that is new 7 to bother
about. The Redistribution of Seats Bill re-
mains the inadequate measure it was when
the State Parliament went into recess some
months ago, though Farmer John is probably
hoping for an amendment to provide for the
old number of country seats and the provision
of three new city seats, a proposal that
w 7 ill be acceptable to all those politicians
who fear that a genuine redistribution may
leave them without a job. There is a vague
proposal to make the Metropolitan Board of
Works, like Julius C.usar, a builder of
bridges, bridges being badly needed to permit
Melbourne to perform its daily escape from
toil without being crushed in the attempt.
A better move would be in the direction of
a Greater Melbourne Council that would
have full powers to look after the bloated
city’s needs, but such a thing is beyond the
imagination of Plodding John. The expected
apprehension is expressed at the Federal
Government’s financial proposals, State
Frightfulness being the settled policy of the
present Vic. Ministry and being more than
ordinarily useful as a red herrinsr just now,
since the Allan crowd is badly in need of more
money than it has the courage to ask for.
More apprehension is exnressed over the
approaching referenda, presumably on the
ground that Australians are not to be trusted
and that it doesn’t matter to the rest if one
compartment does make a mess of things
—doesn’t matter to Victoria, for instance,
whether the N.S.W. coalfields are kept in a
state of constant unrest or not. A fleeting
glance is given also to backward children and
the censorship of films, and the usual stick
of incenee is burnt to the principle of eco-
nomy in the public services. An expert has
been appointed to inquire into the organisa-
tion of tl*e departments and to make recom
mendations, it is announced ; but there is no
rider guaranteeing that his recommendations
will get atoy more consideration than those
of the Ministerial committee of inquiry winch
has already sat heavily on the same subject.

The Root Cause of Unemployment.
A CERTAIN National Insurance Commission
is one of the vagrant and inquiring I ederal
bodies which traverse Australia to find out
things, such as how we would get on with-
out weather, and if it would be desirable to
have two Equators and one Foie instead ot
the present arrangements, Equators being
easier to discover than Foies. Recently this
rather disappointing caravan found a strictly
practical witness in Federal Statistician
Wickens, who discussed unemployment from
a detached standpoint. These were his views
condensed :
The Australian rate of unemployment in recent
years had been unusually high. The figures, drawn
from trades-union returns, showed that between 1891
and 1920 the highest unemployment rate was 108
per 1000, and the lowest 47. in most years the
rate was between 50 and 70 per 1000. In 1921 ;
however, the iu«employed were 112 per 1000, and m
subsequent years- 93, 71, 89 and 89.... When im-
ports were high there was a tendency for unemploy-
ment to be high, and when imports were relatively
low there was a tendency for the percentage of un-
employment to be low.
It is a simple proposition, though Freetrade
importers and their Red Flag allies profess
not to see it. The first crowd would rather
have unemployment than local industries
which would tend to make importing un-
necessary, and the second would rather have
unemployment than anything else, because
they reckon that they must create misery
in order to bring about revolution. The
common or garden logic of things is that a
man can’t get liis clothes from England, or
from any other outside country, and yet
give the work to the local tailor, and the
same rule applies to agricultural imple-
ments and everything else. The matter
might be stated in full after this fashion: —
Large imports (relatively to exports, of course, for
everything is relative) lead to unemployment.
They also lead, in a country like Australia which
has no rich foreign investments, to large foreign
borrowing.
The enlarged debt leads to more taxes, combined
with less ability to pay them.
The debt and the taxes lead to still further lack
of work, and further loans (for relief works and
the like), and additional taxes, and possibly to re-
pudiation or revolution or both.
The Bolshevik, who seeks to destroy local
production (and exports) by strikes and re-
duction of output, and the Freetrader, who
seeks the same end by smothering it with
imports, and the hard-borrowing crank, who
may belong to either party or be just an
independent crank, thus all work together for
bad. The effect as shown by the two periods,
a long and a short one, mentioned by the
Statistician was this:—
From 1891 to 1920 Australia exported, on an
average, £125 worth for every £IOO worth imported.
The surplus of exports wasn’t so very large, for trade
was on a smaller scale then, but though it wasn’t
large enough to meet foreign liabilities, still the
borrowings of the six States averaged only some
£8,700,000 a year. As remarked, unemployment was
on a minor scale then. Incidentally, there were few
Bolsheviks.
From 1920 to 1925 Australia exported, on an
average, only £95 worth .for every £IOO worth im-
ported. In the first (or 20 years) period imports
once reached £2O 2s. 9d. per head. In the second (or
five years) period, they once went to £3O ss. 7d.
per head. Unemployment, as the Statistician stated,
became quite remarkable. It was in the year when
imports were £3O ss. 7d. per inhabitant that 112
unionists out of every 1000 were out of work. State
borrowing was at the fate of £37,200,000 a year,
and the Federal Government’s public works policy
raised the annual loan to some £42,000,000, for
the interest bill had to be met and the mass of
exports (which created unemployment)- paid for.
State taxation increased from 14 to 21 millions per
annum, largely to pay interest on the debt, which
paid for the extra imports, which caused the extra
lack of work. Discontent, Bolshevism and threats of
revolution increased along with imports and debts.
It is a natural and tidy procession, Cause
being followed by Effect, and then more
Cause turning up in the rear to give Effect
an extra shove from behind.
Counterfeit White Cargo.
“Feng-Shui” : I dropped in to inspect
“White Cargo” in Melbourne the other night.
Over 150,000 white Australians arc said to
have seen the play in Sydney, and probably
another 100,000 will be lured thither in
Melbourne. One of the audience remarked
to me: “It’s the real thing, all right. It’s
just like the Islands.” He had never been
to “the Islands,” he confessed, so his impres-
sion was a testimonial to Leon Gordon's
astute manipulation of the accepted stereo-
types. Actually, the thing resembles “the
Islands”—meaning any tropical colony
where white men come up against black —
as much as a musical-comedy milkmaid re-
sembles a cocky’s helper in the Cow Coun-
try. Nevertheless, thousands of white Aus-
tralians, including practically all the drama-
tic critics, have been made propagandists
for the Leon Gordon point of phew, and the
White Australia policy has another burden
placed on its overloaded shoulders. I have
lived in a few outposts of the Empire.
Borneo, one of them, is generally con-
sidered a pretty rough salient. Pro-
bably a bungalow as filthy as Witzel’s
could be found there, and a group
of white men as dirty and degenerate; but
it would require diligent search, and a
similar result could be obtained much more
quickly by taking a tram-ride to Footscray
or the Glebe. Actually what one finds in the
tropics arc communities of ordinary white
mortals, who bathe twice daily and some-
times oftener, put on clean drills in the
morning and a fresh suit in the evening, live
on wide, open, breeze-swept verandahs, sleep
qn spotless sheets in a giant’s bed, and very
frequently put on the dress-suit of civilisa-
tion to dine in state at night. Whisky- and
malaria-sodden unfortunates exist there just
as beer- and morphia-soaked wasters exist:
in Australia ; hut not in large numbers. The
new recruits frequently come out slovenly

mother’s darlings with all the helplessness
of members of the herd; they leave as self-
respecting men, with a new sense of noblesse
oblige, and a habit of command. At home
they have been lookers-on at football
matches; “out there” they learn the habit
of systematic daily exercise. The undula-
tory Tondelf.yo is another fiction. Most of
the native ladies of my acquaintance walk
as gracefully as a pound of butter. They
do not vamp the white man clad in a flowered
wrapper and a string of beads. If he is so
disposed the newcomer acquires his lady by
purchase from her parents. She improves
his domestic economy out of sight, and is
satisfied with a modest pension when her
unobtrusive ministry is over. Often he goes
and returns with a white wife when he can
afford her, and his moral degeneration isn’t
noticed by his neighbors. Leon Gordon’s
thesis is that the climate of the tropics van-
quishes the white man. The triumph isn’t
obvious in about a million places. There
isn’t any record of a hot place, once occu-
pied by white men, being permanently evacu-
ated. The F.M.S. were a deathtrap in the
early stages of the rubber boom. The white
man is still in occupation, and the country
is a deathtrap no longer. He couldn’t change
the climate; but he changed the country.
He always does. Leon Gordon’s wickediy
false types never could.
Queensland Railways Again.
The Queensland Labor party having, by
hook or by crook, and especially crook, re-
tained all its seats at the general election,
it was natural that the caucus should have
re-elected the Ministers. But Mr. Larcombe,
the Railway Minister, might reasonably have
been thrown overboard, for his record is the
worst of a shockingly bad lot. (Some say
that he would have gone, but that nobody
else cared to take ever his job.) Larcombe
has been at the head of the railways since
April. 1920. His deficits in five completed
financial years read :
1920- £1,739,475
1921- 1,743,270
1922- 1,475,192
1923- . . ... . . 1,593,066
1924- 894,498
Total £7,445,501
This is an average of just on £4OBO a day.
The mild improvement in 1924-25 was ob-
viously an accident, and seems to have been
regretted by the Minister, for although com-
plete figures for 1925-26 have yet to be an-
nounced he will almost certainly put up a new
record. (In 11 months ended May 81 his
net earnings were a trifle over £900,000 to-
wards the year's interest bill of probably
£2,800,000 or thereabouts.) Comparing
Larcombe’s five years with the previous
quinquennium (when results under Ftiielly
and others were bad enough in all conscience),
there has been a mad race towards the preci-
pice of disaster and the doormat of the Bank-
ruptcy Court. Interest charged to railways
during the quinquennium was £11,134,051
out of a total interest payment on the public
debt of £17,814,126. Railways thus accounted
for 624 per cent, of Cohen’s collections.
Additional capital “invested” in railways
amounted to £9,186,193, and the losses of
£7,445,501 equalled 81.05 per cent., or 16s.
24d. in the £l. Passengers carried increased
over the previous five years by 4,624,829, or
6.56 per cent., while the tonnage of goods
carried rose by 936,718, or 4.67 per cent.
Against these paltry improvements of 1 per
cent per annum working expenses jumped
from £17,197.587 in the quinquennium ended
June, 1920, to £24,979.350 in the next five
years—a leap of £7,781,763, equal to 45.24
per cent.! The miserable increase in traffic
has been accompanied by a steady lift in
passenger fares and freight charges, a visible
decline in efficiency to the advantage of petrol-
driven vehicles, almost daily breakdowns and
time-table failures, and casualties so numer-
ous that the Minister has ceased to have
them recorded. (See the table of railway
mishaps in Australia in the “Commonwealth
Year Book,” where a gap in the Queensland
column is explained—“not available.”) With
a record like this, Comrade Larcombe is re-
appointed by the caucus ; further, it passed a
resolution which means a rise for him: a
tenth Minister is to be paid so that his
mates will no longer have to cut into their
salaries for his benefit; and according to
all the dependable signs of the times another
jump in the pay of Ministers will be included
in the general grab which is predicted for
the coming session.

Italy and Australia.
“W.P.D.”: The Mackay branch of the
A.W.U. has declared that Italian-grown cane
must not be crushed at Plane Creek mill,
and that their members shall not handle
cane grown by Italians who have purchased
farms within the last nine months. _ Unless
the resolution is vetoed by the Union’s head-
quarters it is quite likely that the Italian
Government will protest, and there may be
complications. Italian farmers and farm-
workers have done their share in the devel-
opment of the sugar industry of North
Queensland, and the majority of them are
hard-working, sober, thrify and law-abiding.
Once they are admitted and allowed to hold
land, no subsequent attempt at differenti-
ating against them can be legally sustained.
Unionists profess to fear that the Italian
will bring down wages or reduce the stan-
dard of living, but the fact remains that
he will not work except for union rates
and union hours. He likes to come to
Queensland,, is eager to get the highest
wages, and, given these, he will save for
himself, pick out and pay for his block of
land, and if anyone can make a success of
it he can. If Italians are inclined to be
clannish it is the hostile spirit of the unions
which encourages them to be so. Far better
hard-working Italians than Asiatics; and
even if wc don’t go out of our way to
attract them, it is bad policy from the White
Australia point of view to discriminate
a S ain st them after we have permitted them

miles apart instead of 50 as at present, thus
enabling stock to be watered daily, instead
of every third day. Conservation of fodder
has scarcely been attempted in Queensland,
although in every good season millions of
tons of grass which would make excellent
hay or ensilage goes to waste or furnishes
material for bush fires. The most crying
need, however, is for adequate, speedy and
economical means of transport of stock from
districts drought stricken to those where
feed is plentiful. The late William Kidston
DIDN’T CONSULT HER ABOUT IT.
THE CORONER : “Did your husband act like a man who contemplated suicide?”
THE MISSUS : "Well, I can't say he did, sir. But, then, he was a queer man—he
never took me into his confidence
saw t.he need for linking up the ends of the
lines running west from the coast many
years ago, and recommended the construction
of a railway from Barringun to Camooweal
and the extension of the South-Western,
Central and Northern lines to join it. If
that proposition had been carried out the
sums saved by the shifting of stock in dry
times would have more than paid the cost
of it. The voting power of the thickly-
settled coast was enough to secure ihe
Brisbane-Cairns line (although communica-
tion between these points was already well
provided for by steamers), but not a sleeper
of the Camooweal-Barringun line has been
laid. Estimates of lohses of sheep so far this
year vary from four to seven millions, and
probably half a million cattle have perished.
Even good seasons for the next half-dozen
years will hardly recoup the losses. The
railway service needs thorough reorganisa-
tion. Trucks, trucking facilities, pace of
stock trains, shunting and yarding all stand
in great need of improvement, and the short-
age of engines is militating seriously against
the movement of starving and other stock.
There are 100 engines undergoing repair at
the Ipswich works, and many more are
cripples, constantly breaking down. While
means for mitigating the effects of drought
are so consistently neglected in Queensland,
frightful losses of stock, are as certain as
the rise and fall of the tides.
*
Australian politics look too much like a
procession—one loan-swindle device after
another. A number of years ago Westralia
was benefited with 1051 miles of railway at
the Federal charge. A £4,000,000 duplicate
railway, connecting Sydney and Brisbane,
to be built partly at the common charge,
was commenced the other day. This being
done, Manning (N.S.W.) and Mackey
and Nott (Q.) arose in the Reps, to demand
a long curly line from Bourke through south-
west Queensland and up towards the Gulf
—at the common charge, of course. Then
Prowse and Gregory of Westralia were to
the fore with a demand for a line at the
common charge, from the empty North of
their own State to a bad harbor in North
Queensland —a line, in fact, hugging the
north coast as the one to Perth does the
south. Prowse said he wanted a circular
railway round Australia, and as almost 40
per cent, of such a line would be in his own
State, which would only be liable, on a
population basis, for 6 per cent, of the loss,
Prowse naturally would. The Age said
“there was an implied promise to South
Australia” that if its members supported
these gigantic plunderings they “would
merit reciprocal support for their South-to-
Nortli line.” But the South-to-North line is
a signed and sealed obligation, and has been
paid for with the most gigantic land-grant
on record, and it would be a fool’s game
to buy support for it all over again, even if
there was a hope that the bought would
stay bought. Apart from that, surely this
habit of struggling and scheming to make
somebody else pay for our public works
has gone far enough. The Bulletin is
quite prepared to Federalise the railways;
but wliat the struggle nowadays means is
that the States push on to the Federation
merely those schemes which from the finan-
cial point of view are quite hopeless.
«
Living up to a schedule based upon an
annual increase of slightly over 2 per cent,
of its population, Australia achieved its
sixth million about the beginning of Febru-
ary; and at the end of March its total popn
lation was 6,017,000. At the same rate of
increase the seventh million will be regis-
tered about October, 1933. Apart from the
excessive proportion of the increase in N. S.
Wales, and the position of Tasmania, which
lost 2197 in spite of a quite healthy birth-
rate, the preponderance of the home-grown
immigrant is the most significant feature of
the figures. In five years the population has
had 581,476 additions, and the local cradle
has provided 408,218 (or 70 per cent.) of
them; the five years’ excess of overseas arri-
vals over departures was 173,258, or 30 per
cent. The figures show that the stork re-
mains, and is likely to remain, the best immi-
gration agent, and that an altogether dis-
proportionate fuss is made about the “flood”
of “migrants.” And still, to our disgrace,
nearly 20 per cent, of the children born do
not reach the age of four. There is, besides,
a wastage in motherhood—a high death-rate
in child-birth which might easily be prevented
by the provision of proper treatment and
advice. The baby bonus has proved a fail-
ure, but much might be done to encourage*
potential mothers who must now shudder at
the dangers of child-birth by establishing a
proper system of maternity hostels—the term
“hospital” should not be applied to institu-
tions for the assistance of what should be
a safe and natural function—to serve dis-
tricts where they are needed. Immigration
is not to be discouraged ; but the first politi-
cian who puts in the forefront of his policy
“a vigorous and progressive policy of safe
child-birth” will deserve three cheers.
The constructors of the Sydney City rail-
way having done their worst to Hyde Park,
the mutilated ground is on the point of
being handed back to the City Council gar-
dener. The Wild Life Preservation Society
has put in a very pertinent plea that, in
the tree replanting which is to take place,
native Australian flora shall be used; its
idea goes further to the hope that bush birds
may be induced to make the park a sanctu-
ary if there are sufficient familiar trees to
banish the feeling that they have wandered
into a foreign land. The society’s plea calls
for public support. Other countries have
learned the decorative value of Australian
trees, and in America, Italy, Spain and
(now) in Palestine groves of gums which
foolish Australians in their own country
displaced by imported trees are to be seen.
The old foolish bad taste has greatly dis-
appeared of course; but, unless the people
state decidedly what they want, Sydney may
again see its main city park looking like
a patch of a foreign country, merely as a
result of unforgotten bad habits.

“Dingo” : The other day a well-dressed
young man was charged at Burwood
(N.S.W.) Police Court with behaving in a
riotous manner in a railway carriage. He
pleaded “Guilty under provocation.” Pressed
by the S.M. as to the nature of the provo-
cation, he mentioned that he was a returned
soldier and that a perfect stranger had sat
beside him and taken violent exception
to his badge—didn’t he know the war was
over, and whv did he want to wear the
thing, anyhow? Wasn’t he ashamed of him-
self, and didn’t he really feel that he was a
blankard who was trying to divide the
workers? He confessed that at that he
delivered a frontal attack from which the
enemy was only rescued by the police. The
S.M. raised his eyebrows and asked if this
was correct. The prosecutor admitted that
substantially it was, but ventured the sug-
gestion that the Digger must have been
drunk or he would not have taken offence.
The S.M. raised his eyebrows still higher
and directed the defendant to pay the costs,
but added that no record would be made
against him. I don’t know whether the
Commonwealth Parliament has the power to
pass an Act that would reverse the posi-
tions of complainant and defendant in such
a case as this, but if it hasn’t Bruce might
ask for it.

“Country Ped.” : I attribute the atrocious
handwriting so frequently met on doctors’
prescriptions (B. 24/6/’26) to the long
years spent by medical students in
filling dozens of thick notebooks with
notes of lectures. Anyone who has
been forced to take notes of lectures
without the aid of shorthand soon develops
a specious private shorthand of his own, with
the words so clipned and mutilated that they
are likely to be unintelligible to anybody but
the writer. In five years this kind of writ-
ing becomes a habit that lasts a lifetime. We
might get better-written prescriptions by any
of these innovations: (1) All medical stu-
dents to be shorthand-writers before com-
mencing their first year; (2) professors and
lecturers to speak more slowly; (3) stu-
dents to be provided with type-scripts of the
lectures; (4) all doctors to be required by
law to type their prescriptions. Still, though
bad writing is apparently a badge of the
profession, I must admit that I have never
yet found a doctor who neglected to make
clear, understandable figures in the £ s. d.
column of his bill.'

“Uloola” : To listen to the wails of “Aus-
tralian ’ film people about the devastating
effect of a tariff of tuppence-ha’penny a foot
is to be painfully reminded that the local
movie business hasn’t yet attracted the right
class of investor or promoter. I have no
brief for the Yanks, but if their pioneer
picture-makers had been poor squealers of
the sort that infests the “industry” here
there would have been no U.S. domination
of the film markets of the world. What our
industry needs is a few patriots with grit
and vision, and the determination to be
something better than imitators of Holly-
wood. Of course we need a tariff, too; but
don’t let those fellows bluff us that the tariff
we’ve got is no good. That is a little game
that has been played very successfully in
the past.

“Country Ped” : For the past two years
in co-operation with the Railway Depart-
ment and the Tramways Board, the Vic
Education Department has been conducting
a rather intensive Safety First campaign
Every school in the State has been supplied
monthly with a set of posters; every week
one is strung up in a conspicuous place,
and appropriate comments are made by
teachers. It is a fine idea; but why should
the reference almost always be to dangers
from jay-walking, trams, electric wires, rail-
way trains and crossings and motor traffic
in busy streets? Not all the preventable
accidents occur in the cities. The country
youngster needs his warning, too—against
the deadly pea-rifle, for instance, and the
danger of blindly poking hands into logs.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The abolition of the per capita payments
is not to be effected foi* 12 months; Bruce,
Latham, Gibson, Hill and Paterson found
they could not stand np against the antago-
nism of the non-Labor section in State poli-
tics. Alex. Peacock thundered away day
after day and pulled every political string
he could lay hands on. Usually the refer-
enda proposals were bracketed with the finan-
cial arrangements in the condemnation. So
to save the referenda the Vic. Cabineteers
and Federal members urged and got the
modification. A Cabinet with five Victorians
and no representatives of two other States
is apt to be ultra-sensitive to Vic. opinion.
In addition to promising a surplus of
£14,000, N.S.W. Treasurer Lang boasted in
his Budget speech on December 3 that "if
the railways and other services were sold to
private enterprise, they would realise a very
much larger sum than the whole of the
N.S.W. public debt.” The noisy calamity
iow admits a deficit of £1,274,000, and
flames it all on the “railways and other ser-
ices.” Yet his 44-hour-week tomfoolery
operated for only half the financial year,
and his workers’ compensation mess, which
will probably add £200,000 p.a. to the cost oi
running the railways and tramways, didn t
operate at all. Moreover, he had the use
of 11 million of 1924-25 income-tax money
which was carried over into 1925-26. In the
same Budget speech the mountain of conceit
mentioned that he had cot rid of Stevens,
Director of Finance under the previous Gov-
ernment, because the fellow didn t know his
job.
Having nothing fresh to announce at the
re-opening of Vic. Parliament, the Allan-
Peacock Cabinet announced it in a speech
containing 1400 words and 55 to]? cs. It is
strongly suspected that the compilation was
for the new Ex.'s own benefit, as for Vic-
torians there was a familiar ring about
every intimation, from the bright outlook to
the blessing of Providence. Speaking the
rate of 109 words a minute Baron Somers
got through in slightly under 13 minutes,
and the whole show was over in 20 minutes.
The wicked Count Hannibal, riding
through Paris after St. Bartholomew’s Day,
1572, smiled a cynical smile at the wreck an
amateur king, aged 22, had made of his
capital. It would be well if Premier Lang
took a run through the timber-getting and
share-farming regions of N.S.W., and con-
sidered the destruction that an obstinate
suburban house-agent and some skittish
young barristers and sundries have made of
N.S.W.’s “primary” industries. They were
almost as sudden as Charles IX., and they
can’t lay the blame on mother, as he could.
The, worst feature of the local case is that
an excellent principle has to suffer in popu-
larity, perhaps permanently, because the most
conceited Government for 50 years thought
debate was unnecessary and therefore killed it.
There has been too much class conscious-
ness about the reception of the N.S.W.
Workers’ Compensation Act. It was shown
in, among other things, the refusal of so
many insurance cos. to operate under the
Act. Their business in life is to accept risks,
and here were risks to be taken. If they
thought the risks great, then their obvious
course was to make the premiums corres-
pondingly great. It isn’t their business to
consider whether the law is good or bad, any
more than it is their own clerks’ business
to consider whether a policy they propose
to issue is good or bad.
Victoria had a deficit for the year ended
June 80 —the first for nine years. Of a total
shortage of about £BOO,OOO, the railways
were responsible for more than £200,000.
Nothing is said about the welter of borrow-
ing to spend on over-costly and unprofitable
works, but a poor harvest and increases to
employees drawing under £8 a week are
blamed for the rest. As the per capita ghost
has been laid for a year, it won’t be much use
Peacock going to the Upper House for more
taxes, but if Parliament settles down to busi-
ness some increases in railway freight rates
and fares will be clapped on by Order-in-
Council.
The N. S. Wales Government railways,
which had a good name for efficiency and
returned a decent annual profit before the
politicians seriously interfered, were last
year brought under political control to the
extent that the Commissioners were ordered
to promote 1917 strikers and degrade non-
strikers, and to introduce the 44-hour week
throughout the service on January 1. Labor
Premier Lang was so gratified with the out-
look that, as Treasurer, he predicted a rail-
way surplus of £743,000. Last week the
gentleman had to admit that he had over-
estimated railway receipts by £805,000, and
under-estimated expenditure by £529,000.
About the same time the coroner who in-
quired into the derailment of the Brisbane
limited at Aberdeen on June 10, as a result
of which four passengers were killed and
many injured, made a thought-provoking
HAPPY THOUGHT.
“Lord Somers, Victoria’s new Governor, opened the Parliament in a speech which touched on 54 topics, ill old stagers.”

reference to the condition of the permanent-
way. Subsequent researches may show that
its condition was the act of God; but mean-
time the finding and the deficit have drawn
pointed attention to the perils of using the
railways for vote-catching purposes.
The record now stands:—

Thus at last those engaged in the “second-
ary industries,” a feeble flock in N.S.W.’s
Foreign-trade days, have definitely become
more important, numerically, than the
“primary industry” lot. And the first crowd
seems to have possibilities of increase in
employment which the second one lacks.
McCormack’s Government in Queensland
has turned last year’s surplus of £16,967
into a deficit of £554,685, in spite of an
increase of £702,462 in revenue. This is the
largest deficit ever admitted by a Queensland
Labor Government, and is the sixth in 11
years of Labor rule, bringing the total to
£1,763,187. Railway expenditure jumped
up over a million —from £5,423,278 to
£6,457,798. The strike and the 44-hour week
are mainly responsible; the effects of the
drought will be shown, for the most part, in
the 1926-27 returns.
The connection between a ranting evan-
gelist and Premier Lang’s new Compensa-
tion Fact—so called because it is stranger
than fiction —may seem remote. Yet argu-
ment is already raging over the case of the
evangelist’s pianist. A dissenter at one
meeting flung a bucket of water at the
preacher, and, missing the ecclesiastical crow,
doused the pianist pigeon. In the case of a
cold, shell-shock, or other injury or disease
arising from the cold water, is the pianist
entitled to compensation, and, if so, from
whom, and to what extent? The case might
puzzle even Lang’s advisers, and it is good
betting they will soon be faced with lots of
others a darned sight worse.
One of London Punch’s pictures during
the war showed “A Prussian Family Doing
Its Morning Hate” —of Britain in particular.
Tiie Bulletin, is organising a Morning
Hate society for the benefit of N.S.W. ex-
Premier Fuller and his old partner Wearne.
They had abundance of warning while in office
to repeal the Casual Vacancies Act, and have
by-elections instead of nominations. If they
had done so it is quite possible that the
Lang Ministry would have stuck in the same
rut as Dooley and Co., and then N.S.M.
might have been spared the Workers’ Com-
pensation Act, the 44-hour week, the _ great
deficit, the Upper House row, the anticipated
gerrymandering of the electorates, and a vast
deal of incivility and bad manners.
American film companies send what they
call “exploitation managers” to this coun-
try, and our poor breed of politicians l'ender
it dashed easy to exploit. In 1921 the House
of Reps, made the film duty 3d. a foot, but
its courage oozed out of it when the Senate,
“requested” a reduction to lid. Ln 1926, 13
Senators demanded a dujty of 3d. a-foot, and,
the voting being equal, 2kd. was agreed to ;
but this time it was the’ House of Reps, that
objected to any increase, and the Senate that
meekly yielded. How the Yanks must laugh
at these weak-kneed twisters, and wonder
whether they belong to the same race as the
Diggers whom the Doughboys joined on tlie
Ilindenburg Line !
This year the Melbourne Tramways Board
will be compelled to dredge out of the pub-
lic’s pocket an additional £850,000. The
total deficit, if fares Remained as they are,
would be over a million. Some of this can
be blamed on the curious absurdity of making
a concern engaged in transporting citizens
pay £lOO,OOO annually to fire brigades, licens-
ing funds and hospitals f|or the treatment of
infectious diseases; but most of it is to meet
the increased wages bill due to Arbitration
Court awards. No sooner had the board put
up its fares to meet one firfping of the Court
than another was announced. And the
spectre of a 44-hour week is always round
the corner.
Over 350 American municipalities are
making trial of the “city manager” system,
and the innovation is claimed to be a success
everywhere. Systems vary slightly, but all are
agreed that the manager should have com-
plete authority, and be safeguarded alto-
gather from interference by the Council,
latter, where it still exists, can suggest a
policy, but it cannot in any way influence
the manager. Party politics may not cor-
rupt, nor alderman break through, under
this system, which reads, to a Sydney rate-
payer, remarkably like a description of the
civic government of Paradise. Had the
Fuller Government done its duty, Sydney
would have had something of the sort long
ago. That most inept crowd having done no-
thing, the city merely has Tammany.
One of the reasons why local manufactures
make such slow headway in Maoriland is
that not one manufacturer in ten brands his
stuff with his name or the place where it
was made. The manufacturers have been
told —and many of them believe —that no
Maorilander would dream of buying anything
that was labelled “Made in New Zealand.”
Now, however, the Dunedin Manufacturers
Association, with many qualms, has agreed
to suggest to the Government that all pro-
tected industries should be compelled to
brand their products with the words “New
Zealand Made.” Probably the idea will be
squelched by representations from cowardly
manufacturers, but if it gets adopted it will
be the best thing that ever happened to the
Dominion.
Among the many interesting items in the
confiscated .Communist correspondence just
published in Britain is the report that “satis-
factory relations” have been established by
the Third International with Australia, a
country that has been lumped with dis-
colored India, Egypt, Palestine and Syria.
It is an ironical comment on the political
conscience that, while one of its members
is splitting the European welkin with his
advocacy of a White Australia, the Labor
party is pandering for votes to an organisa-
tion which has for the leading plank of its
platform the unrestricted brotherhood of
humanity, black, white, brown and brindle.
Germany's agitation for the return of her
colonies, once largely a monarchist move-
ment, is now wide-
spread. One observer
notes that the plates
and mugs in the cafes
and beer-gardens are
inscribed with propa-
ganda demanding the
return of the “posses-
sions.” A political
campaign that goes
hand in hand with
beer is sure of earnest
consideration from the
most indifferent voter
—and not only in Ger-
many, either.
Dr. Ev a 11. the
M.L.A. from N.S.W.
who lias been purport-
ing to represent Aus-
tralian Labor at an
international confer-
ence, offe r e d some
further remarks rc his
objection to desirable
white Britons coming
here. The worst case
of unemployment, he
said, was Great Bri-
tain, which exports
settlers. Better than
Britain, but next
worst on the list, he
said, was Australia,
which imports popula-
tion in a small way.
Better than Australia
was Canada, which
imports population
in a much larger
way. It looks as if
the bright young man
was arguing against
his own argument,
and that the more
people you import the further away you get
from “the worst case,” which doesn’t import
people, but exports them.
The scene was a press conference in Lon-
don, and our .Tosenh Cook attended with a
usual remark in his mouth. Said the cable:
The High Commissioner for Australia protested
against hostile criticism of Australian borrowings,
which were for remunerative development, without
which progress was impossible.
Of course progress is impossible without
development, just as travel is impossible
without moving; but what hast .that got to
do with borrowing? The world can show
some pretty old civilisations that have
achieved their progress without foreign
loans. Whether it pays to borrow depends
entirely upon the use made of the borrowed
money; and so far as Australia is con-
cerned the Oldest Inhabitant begins to for-
get when a new public work built out of
loan paid the interest.
ANOTHER “PERMANENT” AND
“REPRODUCTIVE.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Yesterday the line from Bellerive to Sorell was
closed down. It was opened in 1892 and stocked
with two engines and 10 carriages from the old Tas-
manian Main Line Company. The line was 15 miles
in length, and had never paid.”
Let us weep upon the tombstone of a loan job now"
deceased,
Mourn the “permanence” departed, and the “re-
production” iied;
Though the burial was long delayed we must admit,
at least,
Now the funeral is over that the corpse is .better
dead ;
But the undertakers’ interest is left to make us
grieve
The never-paying railway from Sorell to Bell-er-ive.
Kven men who are not greybeards can remember well
the day
When the wine of joy unbottled set glib tongues
talking free,
In a rich, proud tone, of “Progress” whilst the
feasters yelled “Hooray!”
And envisioned golden fancies of prosperity to be.
Wine and words both ran a banker from morn fill
dewy eve
When they opened the new railway from Sorell to
Bell-er-ive.
Let us weep upon the tombstones of a hundred such
affairs
As we keep up our instalments on the undertakers’
bill,
Whilst our politicians puff their chests and proudly
put on airs,
Prattling punkily of “Progress” and “the wider
vision” still.
They spend their gas, they spend the loan and then
they die and leave
A never-paying railway from Sorell to Bell-er-ive.

In January the co.’s older factory building
containing machinery, plant, stock, etc., was
swept by fire. The building and contents
were fully covered by insurance, and there
was a minimum of loss through disorganisa-
tion, thanks to a transfer of operations. to
the co.’s other factory. Prompt installation
of additional plant and internal reorganisa-
tion resulted in a speedy recovery. Had it
not been for the fire, sales and profits “would
undoubtedly have been much greater.” It
seems a reasonable claim, as a gross income
of £72,216 (£58,981 for 1925) came -from
nine clear months and three following th;e fire.
As a settlement has yet to be made under
the profits policy, the figures for the current
term should benefit. Despite the bright tone
of the report to shareholders the fact stands
that competition in many of the lines handled
has grown keener in the past 12 months. In
gramophones this is particularly evident;
almost every retail firm of size seems to be
handling its own brand of machine, apart
from the increase in the number of one-man
factories. The co. faced both circumstances
in the previous year, and reorganised pro-
duction. The widening of the competition,
however, is a disquieting feature. Last
year’s trading profit of £67,848 was £9085
greater than that shown for 1925, but expen-
diture increased by £12,002, while £7272
was appropriated as provision for deprecia-
tion and bad and doubtful debts as against
£3923 in 1925. Also £2436 was added to the
goodwill items, most of it doubtless repre-
senting the consideration for the world’s
patent rights of the Salonola (the co.’s excellent
talking-machine), the straight-out purchase
eliminating future royalty payments. Good-
will. patents, trade-marks, etc., were in at
£72,415, with £2784 down for branch estab-
lishment account. These arc not accounted
assets in this Column’s calculations, and as
there was at March 31 only £lO,OOO in
general reserves and £771 undistributed
balance, the amount of capital unrepresented
by tangibles was £64,429. Other balance-
sheet figures compare thus :

The increase in book debts indicates a vigor-
ous selling campaign, largely on t.-p., and
some benefit was at last received from the
co.’s subsidiary which runs the Patlie. Baby
Films —a line for whose disappointing re-
sults hitherto it is difficult to account; else
where it is reputed to be a good money-
maker. More or less liquid assets amounted
to twice the outside liabilities.
The settlement of the insurance claim
will assist the current term, but the outlook
is still not very bright. Prefs. received half
their div., so there will have to be £12,000
available next balance before ords. get a
look in. The fact that there are 200,000
prefs. to feed means that ords. are pushed
a good way into the background. Although
there are net tangibles equal to 225. for each
pref. share, the market views the outlook
with a pessimistic eye, and sellers have
quitted at as low as 12s. 6d. It is not easy
to justify the figure.

For many years this old-established business
had its headquarters in Melbourne, and in
1885 a proprietary co. was registered there.
Later the widely-scattered business was cut
up, and trading was carried on by indepen-
dent cos. A few years ago the various in-
terests came together, and Gordon and
Gotch (Australasia), Ltd., was formed to
take them all over. This meant a vast
amount of organising, which was not made
any the easier because of the large number
of vested interests which had grown up in
the course of years. The financial results
to begin with were consequently disappoint-
ing ; but steady improvement has been shown,
and for the past year the directors have been
able to exhibit profits equal to more than
double the amount of the 8 p.c. ordinary
div. after providing for the 8 p.c. prefs. This
excellent lay-by has brought the reserves to
a total greater than the £118,074 at which
goodwill figures as an asset, so that share-
holders can now see all their capital repre-
sented by material assets in excess of out-
side liabilities. Still, all material assets are
not of the same quality; and in this case
there are some which are very difficult to
value. The position has lately varied as
follows :

Other assets . . .. 13,517 15,544 17,851

During last half-year some more money was
got in from calls on the contrihs.: at March
31, in addition to the 100,000 8 p.c. prefs.,
there were 482,005 ordinaries fully paid and
17,095 paid to 15s.
The £19,269 called helped to reduce the
bank overdraft. But, probably as the result
of re-organisation, both stock and book debts
were reduced, so that the overdraft was
brought down from £141,478 at the Septem-
ber half to £50,152 at March 31. These
movements are all to the good. The pre-
mises item was a few thousands greater, but
mortgages were reduced a trifle. A ware-
house has been purchased in Adelaide, the
old building proving inadequate. In Bris-
bane the new warehouse is still under con-
struction, and the Sydney building is to be
re-modelled to provide additional space. The
£132,520 at which premises stand in the
books is a conservative figure, since the co.’s
blocks are all near the heart of the respec-
tive capitals. The co. has put a lot of
money into premises; but the mouth of -the
city landlord has been opening wider and
wider, which has driven many trading cos.
to launch out in concrete for themselves.
Movements in the liquids and semi-liquids
afford a clearer view perhaps of the half-
year’s progress. At the September balance
the total floating debt was £298,731, while
more or less liquid assets amounted to
£736,848; at the latest balance the floating
debt was £204,214, against which there were
£682,993 of liquids and semis, an improve-
ment in the surplus of £40,662, partly
accounted for by the new capital. With a
million’s worth of assets exposed to risks,
the board has been wise to give liberal atten-
tion to reserves. The temporary sacrifice —
if 8 p.c. can be called a sacrifice —should
make the ordinaries feel much more com-
fortable than they might reasonably have
felt three or four years ago.

Big alterations and additions are being made
to the co.’s principal building, and the
£50,000 outstanding on the 100,000 contribs.
is being called up. Another £24,000 was
held in cash on March 15, so there is ample
to go on with, and if there wasn’t the co.
would have no difficulty in raising half a
million any morning. The new structure
will be of modern design, but will retain
some of the features of the old Piazza,
though that appears to involve putting enor-
mously valuable space to comparatively small
use. By building in sections disorganisation
of business will be reduced to a minimum, a
vital consideration with retailers who have a
fat goodwill to hang on to. The premises
are opposite the Museum Station of the new
underground—the line passes underneath
the building which is to carry the additions
—and as it is likely that traffic will be
opened in October or November, increased
business should be won from the stream of
passengers which will be brought to this
point by the electric trains.
The balance-sheet shows a position of
exceptional strength :

Considering the turnover, liabilities were so
light as to amount almost to a joke, prompt
payments and the utmost in discounts being
the co.’s policy. Manufacture forms an im-
portant part of the co.’s activities, but pro-
fits from all sources are covered by the one
entry: Gross profit on manufacturing and
trading, after makinsr provision for deprecia-
tion of leases, plant, furniture, etc. Last
year’s total of £394,420 was £2500-odd less
than for the previous term, while exes, called
for £5672 more, but neither movement was
important. The increased tariff will help
the producing side of the business; of course
it needs help in view of all the impositions
put upon industry, but it isn’t every business
that, gets what it needs, and to that extent
Foy’s are ahead of many.
When most of the retail rag firms were
hit by the slump a few years ago, Foy’s
handed out the usual divs. and sent a wad
to reserves. That evidence of keen manage-
ment explains in part the popularity of the
scrip on the market. The fully-paids keep
around 525. As soon as it was known that
the call was to be made on the contribs. they
iumped from 335. to 415.; the buyer who is
offering 40s. hopes to get in fully paid at
505.. at which price the 15 p.c. div. will give
him a 6 p.c. return. But there are always
possibilities about a co. with visible reserves
equal to about three-fourths of the ordinary
capital, with a large amount of inside re-
serves represented by undervalued properties
and with surplus profits averaging for the
past four years enough to pay 7 p.c. p.a. on
the ordinary canital. Prefs. are above par
despite the low rate (6 p.c.), because after
providing cover for the small outside liabili-
ties and for payment of the final divs. holders
see £1,064.605 of tangibles—-goodwill of
£lOO,OOO was written off in 1915—equal to
£3 18s. for each of the 272,902 shares.
* * * *
Commonwealth Traders Insurance
Co., Ltd., an amalgamation of the fire, acci-
dent and marine department of the Com-
monwealth General Assurance Corporation,
Ltd., and the Australian Traders’ Insurance
Co., Ltd.:—
The co. was fortunate in its underwriting
experience in its first 12 months considering
the heavy losses which hit most other offices
during tlie period. Net premium income was
£49,389, and divs., interest, etc., brought in
£2362. Claims called for £17,843, which, at
36 p.c. of net premium income, was well
below the general experience—some of the
solidest offices showed over 50 p.c. Expenses
took £23,535, and that was far too heavy,
but not unexpected in view of the duplica-
tion which existed over part of the term.
Surplus revenue amounted to £10,374, which
was appropriated: £9OOO to reserves; £992
to' write off part of £6992 standing at Estab-
lishment Account; the balance (£382) is un-
appropriated. The revenue account makes
fair reading, but balance-sheet figures are a
different matter. Paid capital is £76.806, of
which £50,999 represents fully-paid £1 shares
and £25,807 the 103,227 contribs. called to
ss. each. The prospectus showed 25,000
fuily-paids as part consideration of the fire,
accident and marine business of the Com-
monwealth General, and 15,000 fully-paids
as part payment to the Traders’ and 10,000
for its surplus assets. The accounts as at
March 30 show shares in other cos. at
£49,121; but in addition there are “Goodwill
—purchase of business account, £33,000” and
“Establishment and prelim, exes., £6992.”
The Traders’ (all of whose shares are. held
by this co.) has paid 8 p.c. p.a. since its first
year (1921), and the directors of the hold-
ing co. anticipate 10 p.c. divs. in future. The
holding of Commonwealth General scrip is
of no present discernible value; that young
Life office may win through, but the div.-
paying stage lies a long way ahead.
The financial position at March-81 was far
from solid. Debts totalled £20,161 —deposits
£ll,OOO, sundry creditors £4301 and esti-
mated liability on outstanding claims, £4860.
Assets appeared thus :
Cash .. .. £2,444
Government securities . . . . 0,087
Shares in other cos. at cost . . 49,121
Book debts .. . . . . . • ■ 8,538
Field and office equipment . . . . 1,159
Goodwill and establishment .. 39,992
Quite early in the piece shareholders were
informed that there was no immediate inten-
tion to call beyond the ss. on the contribs.
Rut with heavy liabilities and a weak liquid
position that plan might be departed from
with advantage. Allowing for the appro-
priation for reserves, almost 40 p.c. of capi-
tal was unrepresented by tangible assets.
Furthermore, the £9OOO placed to reserve,
plus the undistributed balance of £382, is
less than half the usual provision for un-
expired risks. *
The amalgamation, according to the pros-
pectus, was to enable substantial economies
to be effected, while the heavy re-insurance
which had been a necessary feature of the
operations of both cos. previously was to be
reduced. The latter has been achieved; the
former has yet to be. Nevertheless, for its
first year the co. shows decided promise.
If the management can build on that foun-
dation and clear the premises of the dead-
wood items it will have bright prospects.
Progress to a sound underwriting basis will
be possible only by insistence on economy in
expenditure and a careful scrutiny of risks.
The Commonwealth has a management which
is not likely to err in either respect.

Net premium income showed a healthy in-
crease, and as claims, although heavy, were
relatively lighter than in the previous term,
the directors handed out 5 p.c. After meet-
ing all outgoings and providing for unex-
pired risks, there was an available surplus
of £4840, and the div. took less than two-
thirds of it. There is no kick coming to the
directors for their caution. People with
policies to place are, it, is true, not very dis-
criminating, but in the long run they do
turn to the co. which keeps more on the pre-
mises than the bare provision against current
risks. Also, the high losses in fire and
marine in the past four years—particularly
heavy in the islands- —have shown the neces-
sity of treading warily :

The management is hopeful regarding the
current term. But it isn’t resting only on
hopes. For one thing exes, have been very
closely watched. The expense rate is better
than it looks, for all development costs have
been charged against revenue, and equip-
ment and stationery are absent from the
balance-sheet. Here is the co.’s experience
from the beginning :

Investments last year brought in £4410,
well in excess of the amount distributed to
shareholders.
“Surplus” of the introductory table does
not, of course, represent accumulated profit.
It is merely the surplus of earnings over
actual outgoings; but every year something
more has to be set aside to provide for the
losses that may be expected before the cur-
rent policies expire. There is, however,
£11,670 clear of the cover for these current
risks, and total funds at March 31 were
in excess of the 150 p.c. of premium income
usually looked upon as sound. Despite the
loading of expenditure with development
charges and the unfortunate loss experience,
shareholders have had 16 p.c. in the co.’s six
years of underwriting. The Pacific’s influen-
tial connections should win it increasing
business and, with a continuation of the
present management, there should be some-
thing good in it for shareholders later on.
Its field is certainly wide, and its possibili-
ties beyond assessment in figures.

About 65,000 people, it is estimated, must
take out policies under the N. S. Wales
Workmen’s Compensation Act, and are
liable to a £lOO fine if they fail to do so,
uiiless they put up guarantees with the Com-
mission and are then authorised to do their
own insuring. And probably 300,000 people
are interested in the policies. Though some
offices, mostly British, have stood out and
decline to cover the risks at any price, all
but a couple of the Australian offices are
open to do business; and in this number
unfortunately are several which are in a
poor position to take any further risks, let
alone risks whose seriousness cannot yet be
fairly judged. The Wild Cat has from time
to time overhauled the accounts of some of
these offices, and shown what a poor handful
of real money they have of their own. Mostly,
however, they have a few thousands which
they have collected from policy-holders. It
will probably all be wanted in due course
to pay claims, some of which have already
ai'isen ; but while it is in hand it can be
used to pay the few thousands required by
the Government to be lodged as a guaran-
tee fund. That a co. can lodge this amount
is, therefore, no proof whatever of the sol-
vency of the office. Nevertheless, when the
man with compensation insurance to place
asks to see the balance-sheet of such a com-
pany, he is invariably met with the i-eply:
“Oh, that is quite unnecessary. We have
satisfied the Government of our position, and
put up a cash bond —so you’d be all right.”
The fact that has to be thoroughly absorbed
is that a cash bond is no proof of the solidity
of an office. Some of these offices are
gambling on compensation chances. Nobody
knows exactly how the business is going to
work out. They say, “If it works out all
right, we’ll be in clover if we can pull in a
swag of this business; if it works out
badly, we’ll have a good excuse for
failure.” A few are, therefore, offer-
ing extraordinary inducements to pull
business their way. Insurance brokers with
large amounts of insurance to place have
been offered commission in some cases 10
times larger than the amount which the
sounder offices are allowing; and commis-
sions like that are not really commissions—
they are bribes. “Go-getters” are also out
canvassing on the same or better terms. Em-
ployers ought therefore to be very careful about
the choice of their offices. In the case of a
fire you know the risk will not run beyond 12
months. It is sufficient if you can see abso-
lute safety for a company that far ahead.
But claims under this new Act may run on
for 50 yeai’s—in cases of permanent disable-
ment. It is therefore infinitely more neces-
sary to inquire into the stability of an office
taking this insurance than an ordinary fire
policy. A case hasn’t arisen yet, of course;
but it seems pretty evident that the em-
ployer doesn’t escape liability by insuring.
If he did he could easily escape liability. So
if an insui-ance office goes broke in a year ox-
two. an employer may be left with a large
liability on liis hands.

Radcliffe and Collins, Ltd., is being
floated to take over the N. S. Wales agency
for the Jowett. an English light car. Capi-
tal is £20,000 in £1 shares; 8500 offered for
subscription, 1500 fully paids to the pro-
motors for their rights and intex-ests;
10,000 reserved. Net profit of £2Bll less
taxation is estimated on a sale of 200 cax-s
for the fix-st year, and as the Jowett is
well known on the English market and has
good selling points, the number seems
small. But everything depends on manage-
ment. All one can say is that the possibili-
ties of fat things are there.

Inspired by glittering gold reports from
New Guinea, Clive Cooper got off the mark
iu Sydney with the New Guinea Gold and
Osmii-idium Co. in 80,000 2s. 6d. shares. Of
these, 45,000 are contribs. paid to Is. and
liable to 3d. calls for the balance, with 10,000
of the same denomination held in reserve;
15,000 paids go to 11. IV. Clark, who is to
lead the px-ospecting expedition, and 10,000
ditto become the pi-operty of the promoters.
The co. has been very much over-subscribed.
Clark is said to have had 30 yeai-s’ experi-
ence, on and off, of New Guinea :
He proposes to take immediate steps to secure
for the company certain valuable gold dredging and
sluicing claims containing a total area of 1440 acres,
together with the necessary water rights. This area
is known to him to contain valuable deposits of
gold and osmiridiiun. Mr. Clark will at once proceed
to the new discovery of gold in the Mandated Territory
with the object of securing leases there.

Sydney Mint has been closed and the
Bank of N.S.W. has decided to discontinue
buying gold, so the Electrolytic R. and S.
Co. enters the field as buyer of bullion and
seller of the toughened gold which in the
past has been supplied by the Mint. A
plant is being installed, and the toughened
product should be available in lots of 2oz. or
more by the end of the month. The office
is in Martin-place.

IV. 11. Vidler, one of the most optimistic
directors of the ill-fated Crown," Mudgee
(N.S.W. 1. which made such a hash of things
in 1922-23, sticks to his illusion that “the
gold was there all right, but slipped
through the battery into the creek below.”
Billy Lees and C. H. Kerry are content to
forget the Crown fiasco; but Vidler, who
had enough scrip to paper a room and kept
the lot, mentions that the prospectors, who
also hung on to their big wad of 20,000 paids,
have taken up the leases again and got Bdwt.
in a trial crushing at a district battery. The
ti-ouble is, of course, that they got from
30dwt. to SOdwt. for fair tonnages carted to
Hill End prior to the Crown float in 1922,
and in so doing exhausted the surface patch
of fair-quality stone that caused the excite-
ment and the subsequent expenditure of
about £30,000 in a vain quest for big things.
The co. itself got Bdwt. from 400 tons
for the first run of the 10-head battery, but
the ore got hungrier, and parcels became un-
payable. Several experts were gulled by the
show, but when Cundy came along he saw
the emptiness of things immediately. That
was the end, except the bailiff.

C. R. Mackenzie, in Sydney last week,
assured expectant holders in the Flagstone,
Emmaville (N.S.W.), that he would have
tin oxide for sale by the end of July.
Concurrently, call notices, requesting pay-
ment of 10 s. a share by July 14
on the 4500 original £5 contribs. paid to
40s. were issued. Scrip-lioldei-s are assured
that this will be the last as well as the
first call, and it would need to be. Mean-
time the market is giving Flagstone a wide
berth until the battery confirms or dispels
the Mackenzie reports. No paper profit has
been garnered by the gi'oup behind the show
—on the contrai'y, it has acquired more and
more paper. Profits, if any, will accrue
from tin, and not from market manoeuvres.

Shareholders of Paringa can’t complain
on the scoi-e of variety. At the annual
meeting held in London last month, Chair-
maix Parker said that, besides its old show
adjoining the Oroya Links at Kalgoorlie,
the co. held lai-ge share interests in the
Lomah gold-mine, Rhodesia, the Anglo-
Bolivian rubber estates and a brown-coul
deposit in Victoria. Work which might
give them “a clue to what they had been
looking for for years” was in progress on
the Kalgoorlie property, while the others
mentioned wei’e tipped to do well in the
near future. But meanwhile the co.’s cash
is beir" mopped -hi.

Surprise lead-mine at Galena, Northamp-
ton (W.A.), has closed down. It had a fine
body of rich ore near the surface, but after
being worked for some time got into a shock-
ing state as regards equipment and under-
ground development. The Government, which
had loaned a big amount, eventually took
a hand in the management and considerably
reduced liabilities. A falling mai-ket and an
impoverished shoot at depth, however, forced
it to give up before the whole of the debt
was wiped off.
* * * *
Brown’s Reward (W.A.) has asked an
independent expert to inspect and report.
The co. tried several things which turned
out badly before it got hold of its present
show at Field’s Find; and, although the
latter has yielded a few good crushings, there
is a sti-ong doubt about the shoot living
down. Shoots die young in this locality.
* * * *
Word comes from London that another
co. will shortly re-open the Horseshoe. Great
Boulder, which works the adjoining pi-o-
perty, is probably the co. Anyway, as
it pi-oduces and ti-eats similar ore and has
several levels connected with the Shoe, it
should be able to handle it more cheaply
than anyone else. In fact, in the interests
of everybody concerned, both mines should
have been amalgamated years ago. Had this
been done before the rich reserves had been
so deeply cut into, hundreds of thousands of
tons of ore which are now below pay limits
could have been profitably worked.
* * * *
Mt. Morgan has almost 400 men getting
the open cut ready. A second shift is
reported for the concentration plant, and the
main shaft is to be repaired down to the
Linda ore pocket. Quotations for the scrip
have hardened, but there is no firmness
about the movement.

The Bulletin, during the last few
months, has commented on the unduly high
prices ruling for Malayan tin stocks which
had not, tip to then, produced oue ounce
of tin. In February last, punters were
bucked to such an extent that they paid
from 445. to 455. for Malim Nawar and
Malim Nawar South shares. Pitt-street’s
opinion is that Melbourne and Adelaide
speculators headed the rush to get in. For
a long time inter-State operators left Allu-
vial Tin severely alone, but the steady rise
in share values, backed up by the success
of Rawang and the success that previously
rewarded the patience of early shareholders
in other Malayan tin ventures, overcame the
pessimistic attitude of ci’itics in all States.
With the bait of steadily l-ising share values
dangled before their eyes, a wild scramble
for shares ensued. Forgetting the lesson of
Tupai. Kota, Rawang. Bundi, Nawng Pet,
Ulu Yam, Assam, Takuapa, etc., that suc-
cess in Malayan tin mining is rarely achieved
until after many months necessary for cor-
rection of faults in mine equipment, dredges,
plant, etc., the optimists again led the rush.
These were, in many instances, identical
with those who bumped the 2,000,000 dollar
shares in Rawang to a premium of 50 p.c.
six weeks after flotation, and afterwards led
the scramble to unload the same shares at
a discount of 25 p.c. below par. They have
now the humiliation of seeing Rawang estab-
lished as one of the biggest tin producers
among the Sydney controlled companies.
Histoi-y has repeated itself at Malim Nawar
and, as in the case of Rawang, plant difficul-
ties have again occurred and the market has
tobogganed by as much as 10s. per share.
The buyers at 445. 6d. have become the
sellers at 365. 6d. It is significant that the
followers of the stable did not participate
in either move. As in the case of Rawang,
it is the punters who have been stung. Once
more over-optimism has become ultra-pessi-
mism. One sorely smitten punter, on cutting
his losses, bewailed the fact that whenever
he had bought shares on margins for a rise
the market fell, and whenever he had sold
out the market rose; his one consolation
was that the market never moved sideways,
or he would be caught in that direction
also. The Bulletin, always deprecating
boom prices, does not consider that the
difficulties at Malim Nawar, which are
claimed to be of a temporary nature, as
yet justify great alarm. Nothing has yet
occurred to disprove the estimates of the
co.’s engineers. If the estimates in the
various prospectuses and the engineers’
reports are to be at all relied on, there is
a big margin between success and failure.
Shareholders cannot well do better than
wait patiently for further developments.

Captain Teddy Miles has formed another
tin co. With him are A. A. Ashbolt, A. W.
Palfreyman, Temple Miles and Khaw Joo
Tok, the Chinese millionaire of Penang.
The float is the Kopah, and the floater is
Siam Concessions, which goes fox-th in “the
East” seeking for Captain Teddy what he
may select. In this case it has sorted out 300
acres from an offering of 2000 acres. Vendors
wanted £140,000 for the lot, including 400
acres which were “said to be worth”
lib. oxide a yard. All the vendor gets is,
£25,000, half in cash and half in shares,
which won’t hurt anyone. As this block of
300 acres averages 90z., the question is what
has become of the 400 aci’es of lib. dirt?
Has the captain been content with something
less showy, but to the mind of his gang of
borei-s a bit more constant in grade? Price,
on the figures, is not only reasonable, but
the float is reasonable. Of 110,000 shares oi'
£1 each, 12,500 paids go to the vendors,
7500 10 p.c. cum. participating prefs.
are to be allotted for £7500 cash to the five
directors who guarantee the subscription of
70,000 contribs. Then 20,000 paids drift into
the lap of Siam Concessions for its option.
Each shareholder in it will have the right
to apply for 70 of the contribs. per share of
his holding. It is more or less a Miles-
Palfreyman-Khaw Joo Tok family affair; so
there isn’t need to publish reports by the
examining engineers, H. 11. Miller, F. A.
Roberg and 11. H. Reid; it sutficeth to know
the class of men the veteran relies, on for
certificates of safety in his tin mining.
* * * *
Nakon goes to an early grave. The cash-
box is empty and there isn’t an excuse to ask
for more. Already the affair is forgotten
save by those who were promised board fees
and by the foolish virgins who plunged into
the market when the prospector had barely
begun his job.
Plan Soon (F.M.S.) failed to set Pitt-
street afire when listed last month. Ven -
dors’ holdings are heavy: out of £175,000
nominal capital, vendors’ scrip runs to
£81,665, and only £58,335 of £93,335 of con-
trib. capital has been subscribed and shares
issued. The Malay-Siamese Prospecting Syn -
dicate as vendor got £116,665, inclusive of
the 81.665 20s. vendors’ shares, balance, of
£35,000 to be in shares or cash with. a mini-
mum of £11,665 as cash. In. addition, the
vendor syndicate underwrote 35,000 of the
contrib. issue, and duly deducted the .£11,665
owing in cash to itself. A. J. King, of
Nawng Pet, figures prominently; his co-
di rectors are T. J. McGregoi’, of Taiping,
and Lim Chin Guan, Penang. The co. lias
a composite block of 370 acres in Tanjong
Tobalong district, on the west side of the
Kinta Valley, and nine miles south of Ipoh.
Other concessions amounting to 1088 acres
are spoken of. Lim Guan and tribute parties
have worked the show for years, recovering
442 tons tin-oxide in the process. King’s
report gives average depth as 77ft., of which
half is tin-bearing karang, actual recoveries
being 5.91 b. to the yd. But it is below 77ft.
where we begin to get real figures. Here-
under 36ft. gives 14.41 b. to the yd., “the
deep-lead proposition being of the same
nature as Tronoh and Laliat, in the same
district.” Just here a small fly settles in
the ointment: “The majority of bores bottom
between 75ft. and 100 ft. on the limestone,
but between the limestone hummocks bottom
is not reached. One bore to 150 ft. gave
11.331 b. to the yd. for 69ft. from present
working bottom.” The problem, of course,
is one of extraction. Little information is
afforded about existing methods, but the
report recommends “electrification of some
of the costly haulage and pumping performed
by portable engines,” and that electrically-
driven excavators and conveyors of the latest
type should be installed to strip the over-
burden and work the karang at the same
time.” The present co. recovered 21 tons
in April from 20,000yd5., 38.!- tons in May
from 25,000yd5. and 23 tons in June from
27,000yd5.—21b. ground and better.
A cable last week-end said that the total
visible world’s supply of tin at the end of
June was 15,037 tons, as against 17,045 tons
at the end of May. and 19,535 tons in June last
year. Consumption during June was 10,856
tons, as against 8197 tons for May, an in-
crease of 2659 tons. Supplies received dur-
ing June totalled 8848 tons, as against 8197
for May last, and 10,073 tons for June,
1925. Deliveries for consumption in June,
1926, have been exceeded only once in the
past year—January, 1926, showed a con-
sumption of 10,944 tons. Monthly supplies
during the past 12 months average 9195 tons,
with monthly consumption averaging 9569
tons.

Manna Hill and B. H. Southern Lode
Continuation have been listed on Sydney
Exchange. Manna Hill is the Stuart Town
proposition which awaits the pick to prove
whether it is merely a rich dab or some-
thing better. Southern Lode aims to test
the ground south of the Barrier South and
beyond the Zinc Corp.’s leafees. There are small
runs of ore in a hundred places! around Broken
Hill, and some occur under the surreptitious
rubbish-tips of the plain that stretches
out towards the Pinnacles; but if anything
worth having is got, it will almost certainly
be at great depth, and the small working-
capital (the 100,000 7s. 6d. contribs. taken
up by the public have to pay £6OOO to the
vendors) would be far better used in boring.

chester carbine, one of the first in the district,
I met my old friend, this cheerful citizen.
He was greatly interested in the rifle, and
lamented that “the b’ys” didn’t have a few
of the like. Although the members of the
gang were excellent horsemen, they w T ere,
as a matter of fact, only middling rifleshots,
and despite a good deal of practice were poor
marksmen with the revolver. The only thing
that saved them so long was that their pur-
suers were mostly worse.
“Bilbo": The real hiding-place of the
Kelly gang w T as in the wildest part of the
hills, on the plateau of Mt. Cobbler, near
the source of the Rose and Dandongadale
rivers. There a log hut was built beside
the sw r amp known as “the Lakes,” near the
440 ft. waterfalls. The plateau is approach-
able only along one steep spur, and is prac-
tically impregnable. The old hut and the
tree referred to by “Wang” (B. 24/6/'2G)
were both destroyed by a bush-fire a few
years ago—to the great disgust of the Whit-
field publican.

“Hi": I wrnnder if a w r ad of re jected verse
(it was THe Bulletin that did the reject-
ing. too) ever landed another man into such
a mess as this. She was a fascinating lady
wiiom I first met in a Cairo casino. All
being fair in love, I had posed as an officer
to become better acquainted, and was soon
meeting the enchantress at her own house,
where there was a rose-garden surrounded by
towering walls. The clever questions about
military matters she asked me in such a
childlike w r ay set my brain working over-
time. but I gave her a good run for her
money, and if the heads had heard me they
wrnuld have been staggered at the military
knowdedge a humble private can fashion into
plausible lies. One starry night her pink
finger-tips strayed within my tunic and came
in contact wflth an envelope. She tried to
withdraw it, but I begged her not to and
confided that they were documents relating
to mobilisation orders that I should have
locked up. but had been in such a hurry
to meet her, etc., etc. Her persistency deep-
ened my suspicions about her and I shied
at a parting drink, but I fell when she pro-
duced an unopened box of Turkish delight—
the genuine stuff is delight indeed. I sup-
pose it was 18 hours after when a beastly
native policeman kicked my ribs in the
Ksbekiah Gardens. My head suggested to
me that I was in Hell, and my stained face
and arms and the filthy fellaheen gabardine
covering my otherwise naked body tended at
first to deepen the conviction. I have never
been able to look on Turkish delight since
without a shudder. Of course I never saw
that wad of MS. again, either.

“XI)” : Something of a record went up in
Queensland the other day, when an optimist
who professed to be selling milk was fined
£3O because the liquid contained 75 per cent,
of added water. The fine seems rather light
for the offence, but another case heard later
in the day indicated that even a pecuniary
penalty may have a deterrent effect. The
same defendant was again fined, this time
for selling watered milk on the afternoon
of the day he had been caught with the 75
per cent, goods in his cans. He had obvi-
ously taken his earlier experience to heart,
however, for the afternoon milk contained
only 13.4 p.c. of added water. „

“Scrivener" : It was when I was a typist
in a north-west (Vic.) country lawyer’s
office that an elderly lady burst into the
office and began: “You’re conveyancers,
aren’t you?” I acquiesced. “Then can 1
see the principal?” “Yes, in one moment,’
I said, “he is engaged at present.” “Oh! I
can’t wait,” she told me ; “would you mind
tellin’ him to send a cab down to Mrs.
straight away? She has to be taken to the
hospital to be operated on.”

“S.F.”: A polite stranger met my friend
from the country in Swanston-strcet and
presently lured him along to a land-agent’s
office. There the stranger, who was also
apparently a stranger to the land-agent, had
a spirited talk with that person, and finally,
being quite persuaded, handed over £2OO
as deposit on some suburban blocks. With
this encouraging example before him. my
friend the countryman was moved to invest
£3O in land in the same locality, which, on
the evidence of a map hanging on the wall,
was shortly to be served by a railway. Then
the mysterious stranger mysteriously dis-
appeared. When my friend inspected the
blocks with the agent he found things far
different from what he had been led to
expect, but was nevertheless held to his bar-
gain. Although the police admit that some
unusual methods of selling land have been
evolved in this same office, they declare them-

selves unable to take criminal proceedings.
I suppose they are right: which only makes
it more necessary than ever to regard every-
body who mentions a little land deal as a
potential thief. After a while, if that were
the general attitude, the decent ones might
do something for their own protection.

A MISLEADING FLAG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Rev. G. H. De Kay, of Hawaii, was the
guest of the N. S. Wales. Prohibition Alliance at
lunch. The slogan of the United States, he said,
is ‘A Stainless Flag and a Saloonless Nation.’ ”
The Stars are rocking drunkenly
On flags that flutter free,
Which makes it harder to forget
These are the emblems that men set
On brands of eau de vie.
The Stripes, too, zigzag to and fro
Like tracks of drunks who homeward go.
The Stars and Stripes are out of date —
Misleading symbols quite.
To hit the Demon Rum a clump
A better banner’d be a pump
Upon a ground of white.
An admirable oriflamme
For sack-forswearing Uncle Sam.
A stainless flag ! A tidless land !
Well, hands across the seas!
Some day, mayhap, by sim’lar means,
On stepping-stones of dead marines
We’ll rise to heights like these;
From Beer’s entangling webs set free,
We’ll raise a new god, £, s. d.

“Bilbav”: Apropos the average Tommy’s
awe for a uniform with pips
on the shoulders (B.
24/6/’2f>). I was one of a
crowd of ex-Diggers who
joined the North Russian
Reli t! Force. On the troop-
ship Czar, bound for Arch-
angel, we were shoved in
with details from nearly
every unit in the British
Army and Navy, and every
crowd had its own special
lots of dunnage stowed be-
low. At Archangel we were
given a day to get our stuff
ashore, and half a dozen of
the Australian detachment
were told off to unload our
gear. Going into the hold in
charge of a lance-jack, we
found a battery of field artil-
lery, guns, limbers, spare
parts—in fact, everything
except the mules—-stowed on
top of it. In the absence of
gunners to lend a hand,
there was nothing for it but
to burrow down; and we
Diggers were sweating and
cursing over the job when a
Tommy battery-sergeant-
major and some hefty gun-
ners climbed into the hold.
Our tunics were hanging on
bits of cargo round about,
and, taking the lance-jack’s
flash, tailor-made, London-
leave garment for an officer’s,
the sarn-major breasted up
lo its owner and asked if his
men could get their cargo
ashore. “Oh, all right, sarn-
major, and while you’re
about it dump ours out too,
will you? My men are
pretty tired,” drawled one-
stripe. Sitting down on con-
venient crates and bales we
lit up and watched our suc-
cessors keeping the winches
busy. When all our gear to
the last Vickers gun was on
the wharf we left. But no-
body who saw it will ever
forget the look on the face
of the sergeant-major as he
watched the lance-jack don
his tunic and suddenly real-
ised he’d been taking orders
from a “private’s batman" and an Australian
at that.
“205": I was Battalion postman on Galli-
poli and couldn’t help noticing that Bob, one
of our hardest doers, was consistently present
when the Aussie mailbags were opened up,
but always went letterless away. As I
found out . later, he never expected to
get a letter himself, but found a certain
fascination in watching the other fellows
open theirs. Bob had been the despair
of the disciplinarians in Egypt, owing to his
deep affection for hop-juice, but, once on the
Peninsula and the temptation removed, he
showed fine qualities of endurance and cheer-
fulness. One day I asked him how it was
he had no correspondent in Australia. After
some hesitation, he confided to me that he
could neither read nor write. A further
question elicited that there was one girl
who might answer a letter from him. -viter
persuasion I was allowed to do the writing,
and in due course the answer arrived, much
to Bob’s astonishment and gratification. Of
course, he brought the letter to me to read
for him, and so commenced a correspon-
dence which continued during the remaining
months at Gallipoli. After the evacuation
I became separated from my unit and did
not see Bob again until I met him just outside
Ballarat a year or so ago. After greetings
had been exchanged, I suggested that per-
haps he could keep one 1 down. “No hope!
he said. “Married now-—haven’t had one
for close on five years.” “Same girl we
used to write to. Bob?" I asked. “Same
one,” he answered; and I was left wondering
whether it was a good or a bad turn I did
him.
“Hi Makai”: The patient mentioned by
“Quack” (B. 17/6/’26) belonged to that
interesting but unfortunate class known as
haemophiliacs or congenital bleeders; and his
sister was an ex-
ample of the rule
that hereditary
bleeding is confined
to the male of the
line. Extreme
cases of haemophilia
often end fatally in
early childhood,
however trifling

tion that can be
overcome by suit-
able pre-operative
and post-operative

“J,’s Ass.": Heard an old Bulletin joke
served up in circumstances which will keep
it stamped on my mind while life lasts. We
arrived off Anzac on the Clacton at day-
break in May, ’l5, but it was too rough
to land; so, after dodging a few shells from
Anafata, we spent the day at Imbros and
returned to Anzac again in the late after-
noon. Why they lauded us in daylight I
don’t know, but going into the row for the
first time we were all a bit nervy, and when
the tow-rope on our barge broke, the com-
ment of the naval bloke in the bows “Now
they’ll be a moral to get us, and me due to
get leave to-morrow, too!” failed to elicit any
grins. When we arrived alongside the jetty
a transport officer exhorted us to “Go like
Hell, there will a shell right on the wharf
in a moment,” and we lit out for the shore
and shelter of the dump with our slowest man
breaking even time. As we went past the
end, an Aussie, safely smoking a pipe, called
to his mate “By cripes, there’s nobody run-
ning stiff to-day!” Fairly long and hectic
war experiences never dimmed the recollec-
tion of that incident —my first 10 seconds of
the real thing.

“Val”: My friend Beuno, who runs the
“super” plant next door, came in wearing
a broad grin instead of his usual careworn
expression. He had been busy, it trans-
pired, with his report on the month’s opera-
tions when a horse and dray pulled up out-
side and a visitor entered. “Is this the
manoor department? Are you the boss?
he demanded. Both questions having been
answered in the affirmative, the cocky asked
lo see the price list and some samples.
Benno turned out 14 different grades of the
fertiliser for different crops. “Cripes! ex-
claimed the potential customer, obviously be-
wildered—“do yer keep all yer horses separ-
ate?”

“Moreton” : Wireless will add to the work
of the police, who even at present have to
spend a lot of their time running about on
errands having no connection with police
duty. Recently the Russell-street (Melb.)
police-station broadcasted a message for a
woman living at Roma (Q.). The call was
picked up by a man at Dalby, who tele-
phoned to the Roma police-station, and the
woman was given the message within 10
minutes. The Brisbane press applauds this
as a novel use of wireless. What the police
will think about it when they have to rush
about delivering agonised appeals to miss-
ing wives or runaway husbands to “come
home; all is forgiven” will have to be prin-
ted on asbestos.

“Centurion”: Australian soldiers have
now another ribbon to add to the string
which has been slowly growing since the
days of the Soudan contingent. This is
attached to the British General Service
Medal for “small wars” since the Armistice
of 1918. Fifty-two, bearing a clasp “Kur-
distan,” have arrived in the Commonwealth
for the two officers and 50 other ranks of the
First Australian Wireless Squadron which
served in Mespot in 1919.

“L’Fou”: The will of a wealthy Victor-
ian grazier just contested by his widow
furnished a reminder of the tribal commu-
nism some of these patriarchs and their
families live under. Often the whole fam-
ily may work hard half a lifetime and
acquire only wealth communally. “Every-
thing is in father’s name,” and grown sons
handle nothing but pocket-money. They
may have every prospect of being well-off
when the old man dies, but there is no
certainty of it. I remember an old Gipps-
land pioneer who, with the aid of a wife
and nine sons, subdued a good slice of the
wilderness. Several of the sons married
and lived in houses erected for them on the
estate. They never handled any money.
Father’s cheques paid for everything needed
REASSURING.
“Your former, parlor-maid has come to us, dear. But don’t be
alarmed —toe don't believe half what she says about you."
—everything, at least, lie thought they needed.
Things had drifted so long they reckoned
they’d wait till the old man died to have
a settling up. But the mother died first.
The old man took a new wife and succeeded
in achieving fatherhood once more at 82.
He doted on that youngest son and wanted
to make his will solely in the new arrival’s
favor. The elder sons, he argued, were
middle-aged, and could fend for themselves
—it was time they struck out for them-
selves, anyhow, but the puir bairn couldn't.
It took the combined influence of those nine
sons, three clergymen and half the neighbors
to get justice done—and then it was a near
thing.

A life-time spent in politics failed to
feather the nest of William Oliver Archi-
bald, who died a couple of weeks after pass-
ing the 76tli milestone. Arriving in Adel-
aide in 1881 he immediately plunged into
the political movements which brought the
Labor Party into being, and was one of the
first batch of Laborites to enter the S.A.
Parliament —that was in ’93. He floated
into the Federal House of Reps, in 1910 on
the wave of Labor popularity and held
office with the Labor Ministry. The con-
scription issue, upon which he took the patri-
otic side, was his political Waterloo, and,
having saved nothing, poverty has been his
lot for the last nine years. The Salvation
Army has been his refuge during much of
that period.
Senator Paddy Lynch (W.A.), who broke
out into a characteristic tirade against. the
leaders of his own party—-Pearce especially
—because he wasn’t selected for the presi-
dency, has some valid grievances, although
it is' doubtful whether he has the tempera-
ment for a chairman’s job. Lynch arrived
in the W.A. Parliament in 1904, and climbed
into the Senate two years later. He got his
first portfolio from Daglish in 1905 —and
the job lasted barely two months. He had
his second sniff of office in 1916, but he was
a mere stopgap. After being 22 years in
politics without ever losing an election, and
having it forced oil him most of the time
how exceedingly well a commonplace next-
door neighbor like Pearce can do out of it,
Lynch’s chagrin that nothing ever comes his
way is natural enough.
“Jingles”: Girdlestone, one time head of
St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, who has just
died in England,
had his own way
of dealing with the
belligerently-minded
small boy. Pre-
fects had instruc-
tions, if a fight de-
veloped, to escort
the combatants to
the gym. and lock
them in that large,
cold building, in
splendid isolation.
With no spectators
to cheer them on,
they generally de-
cided on an armis-
tice.
THOMAS
PATERSON,
M.H.R. for Gipps-
land, the new
Federal Minister
for Immigration
and Markets.
Canon Girdlestone, who passed out in the
Cold Country the other day, was one of the
best-loved pedagogues this country ever im-
ported. The Head of St. Peter’s College,
Adelaide, for 23 years, he did much to re-
habilitate that seminary. He was continu-
ally at war with the trustees over the sys-
tem of swatting for the annual university
exams., and when he handed over the prizes at
the Christmas break-up never failed to accom-
pany them with a sub-acid reference to stew-
pots. An Oxford rowing blue, he had the
shoulders of a centaur, a large, red Fal-
staffian visage, a yellow beard, small, twink-
ling eyes, and a voice that would never have
won him a fortune. During the war he was
acting-head of Melbourne Grammar.
T. P. Mclnerney, the lawyer who was
knocked down by a four-wheeler cab in
Flinders-street the other day and had both
legs fractured, was one of the most brilliant
students Melbourne Uni. ever turned out and
his friends believed he would climb very
high. He soon got into the Leg. Assembly,
but lasted only 22 months, and made no
impression upon the House —the fruity elo-
quence with which he held court audiences
spellbound was not a political asset, and
his star was dimmed. Yet he shone as
warden of Melbourne ’Varsity, and has given
his city useful service as a member of the
managing committee of Melbourne Hospital.
Instead of being a great citizen he has been
a good one.

“Nakhoda” : Two things caused the slump
in just-dead Emil Cou6’s stock. One was the
mumbo-jumbo of his intemperate disciples,
who were prepared for a fee to make the
amputated leg of a Digger grow again if
needed; another was the irreverence of the
Americans, who, after the healer’s unfor-
tunate visit to their country, shortened his
formula, “Every day, in every way, I’m get-
ting better and better,” into “Oh Hell! I’m
well!” Nevertheless the quiet little apostle
of auto-suggestion had some remarkable
achievements to his credit. The dispelling of
Lord Curzon’s insomnia was one. His in-
dustry was amazing. Besides the queues of
sufferers, thousands of letters arrived at his
clinic in Nancy weekly. One of them came
from me. I have his answer —three closely
written, almost undecipherable, pages, but
breathing in every sentence the calm human-
ity of the man.
The seventh disaster in the Australian air
this year occurred last week when Flying-
Officer W. A. Holtliam, showing Cadet T.
S. G. Watson how to make forced landings
at Point Cook flying-school, crashed from
200 feet up. Holtliam saw most of the war
through with the machine-guns before join-
ing the air arm in 1918. He was one of
the squad which made London lift its eye-
brows by performing stunts over that city on
Anzac Day, 1919, and was reckoned one of
the best instructors in the R.A.A.F. His
pupil was a flier of a month’s experience.
Thos. Cawker, of Casterton (Vic.), one
of Cobb and Co.’s oldest drivers and now in
his 88th year, drove the last four-in-hand
coach from that town into Mt. Gambier
(S.A.) on June 30. That marks the end of
the old style of conveyance between these
two centres —the motor service began next
day. The octogenarian attributes his
splendid health to having been a passenger
on the water-waggon for 50 years as well
as a coachdriver. One of his possessions
is a gift he received from Edward P. when
he was called to Melbourne to have a chat
with England’s leading globe-trotter about
the days when King George, as a youth,
made his tour through the western district
of Victoria, and Tom handled the ribbons.
Chandler, member of Victoria’s Uppali
House, claims to be the biggest daffodil-
grower in the Empire. During the season
he sells 300,000 blooms daily in Melbourne.
Frank Clarke, ruler of the roost in Vic.
House of Landlords, who has just been
knighted, was the pet son of the late Lady
Janet. Owing to his slight lameness, he was
not able to play games, except tennis, like
other youths, and needed, perhaps, a bit
more mothering than his brothers. He man-
aged, however, to have quite a good time at
Scotch Col., Melbourne Uni. and Oxford
before marrying a banker’s daughter and
settling down as a grazier and a public man.
Luck has bitten his heels in politics during
the 13 years he has been in the Council.
He has had office for nine years, six as a
Minister under Bowser and Lawson, and
then three as President.
Priminister Bruce has chosen S. C.
Lazarus, M.A., Phil.B., as operator of the
limelight that will play on the Australian
delegation at the Imperial, Conference. The
young man saw war service, remained at
Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar for 1910 and
returned to be senior lecturer in English at
Melbouime Uni. He a bit of press
work, too —a qualification which neither a
political delegation nor a circus is ever likely
to overlook.
For once in a while in Queensland a snug
position in a politician’s gift is not to be filled
by a politician. W. L. Payne, chairman of
the Prickly-Pear Land Commission and
formerly Assistant Under-Secretary for
Lands, is to take the place of the late Harry
■Coyne on the Land Court. In ordinary cir-
cumstances the £lOOO p.a. job would have
tempted a Labor Minister, as it did poor
Coyne, but with the precedent of £2OOO p.a.
positions on the Board of Trade, and the
prospect of £l5OO a year for Ministers, it has
ceased to attract.
Richard Teece, who accepted a piece of
plate from the A.M.P. directors the other
day to mark the completion of his 60th year
in the service (he has had a place on the
board since he retired from the g.-m.’s chair),
was one of the first native-born white Maori-
landers, his first squeak being heard at Bay
of Islands in 1547. His family brought him
to Sydney five years later, and when he was
29 he married the Mayor’s daughter—Helene,
daughter of Alderman Ben Palmer, who kept
the Liverpool Arms on the corner of Pitt
and King streets years ago.
J, M. Sleeman, who has just taken his
medical degree in Melbourne, is the sixth

After 53 years spent in soul-salvaging, 44
of them at Waterloo (Sydney), where he
was as well known as the sandhills, Mon-
signor Collins has been stripped of the
purple by Death. He had the unique dis-
tinction of serving under four archbishops—
Holding, Vaughan, Moran and Kelly. The
only other clerical survivor of his times is
Father James Dunne, of Campbelltown
(N.S.W.). It was Father Collins who went
with Moran to Rome in 1883 when the pre-
late was admitted to the College of Car-
dinals.
A mere fluke made ex-Senator George
Fairbairn, just knighted, Agent-General of
Vic. A Melbourne daily in seeking for pos-
sible men placed Fairbairn at the head of
a list of three. Seeing this, Fairbairn wrote
to the Premier (Lawson) saying that he
was in no way responsible for the suggestion,
and desired that the Government should be
not at all hampered in its choice. At the
same time he offered his services in any
capacity. Somebody in Cabinet suggested
that the Government might do much worse,
and the upshot was that Lawson was
deputed to make the bargain. Fairbairn is in
his 72nd year, and is rich enough to regard
his official £liso a year as small change.
“Oxmead”: South Aus. and Tasmania gre
unrepresented in the present Federal Govern-
ment ; hence some complaints and digging
up of records to show that this sort of thing
has often happened before. But I recall only
one Prime Minister who tried to turn the
necessity of excluding a State to his own
account. When George Reid had formed his
only Commonwealth Cabinet in 1904, he was
careful to mention that it cut him to the
heart to have to leave W.A. out of it. But.
he went on to explain, as he couldn’t find
a suitable man, he had determined to make
W.A.’s interests his own special care, and
since he was the head of the Government,
and there were two or three others to take
care that N.S.W. got her dues, the State
would absolutely gain instead of losing by
having no spokesman of her very own. Old
Yes-No’s' Ministry lasted such a short time
that it is impossible to say whether there
was anything more than oily gammon in his
protestations, but the W.A. papers of the
period commented on them approvingly.
After 13 years, during which it has grown
to like him, Maoriland loses Professor
Huglue Stewart, of Canterbury College. He
was a master at Rugby when he was im-
ported. A year after his arrival the Euro-
pean rumpus broke out, and he joined the
N.Z.E.F. He went into the scrap as a
lieutenant, and came out commanding a bat-
talion and covered with medals. He was
head of the South Island Infantry Brigade
up till quite recently, and was president of
the Maoriland R.S.A. He goes to Leeds
University, where he succeeds a Maorilander
in the Latin chair—P. M. Connal, a gradu-
ate of Canterbury College.
“The Deacon”: The recent mention of
foundation professors in the Cardinal's Col-
lege at Manly (Sydney) calls to mind that
Reginald Bridge, a son of John, the wealthy
Sydney woolbroker, was at first the only
Australian on the staff, and he had been
educated at Rome. Later, Stephen Burke
was added, and after a very long interval
another Australian, Arthur Hogan. Arch-
gaiters Kelly altered all that, and the presi-
dent of the Springwood (N.S.W.) branch,
Eugene Brauer, son of a Sydney undertaker,
will be _ the next president. Monsignor
Hayden is well in the sixties and due to cal!
it a day. Bridge soon tired of the college,
of which he was dean, and went in for parish
work, but died soon after leaving his share
of the family patrimony to the Church.
“Trion”: John Gale, the Ma State’s oldest
journalist, who is now well over 90, took up
work in the Gunning (N.S.W.) Methodist
circuit in 1854, and was in the saddle six
days a week for three years. In that period
lie computes that he rode over 21,000 miles.
Gale came to Australia for “special work
in the goldfields” with six others, and the
Inky Way claimed another of the seven.
This was William Curnow, afterwards editor
of the S. M. Herald. The Rev. E. J. Rodd,
who had charge of the circuit in 1877, started
a mutual-improvement class, and when he
left the members gave him a letter of appre-
ciation. One of the signatures belongs to
Peter Board, who was afterwards N.S.W.
Director of Education.
George Swinburne, who is not so young
as he used to be, has resigned his £5OO-a-
-year job as member of Vic. Electricity Com-
mission. He proposes to take things a bit
easier, and is quite comfortable without the
tenner a week. Resignation has become a
habit with him. He threw up (1) the Min-
istry of Water Supply in the Bent Ministry,
of which he was a white-haired boy; (2)
his seat in the Assembly as member for
Hawthorn ; (3) the Inter-State Commission ;
(4) membership of the Defence Business
Advisory Board when the work was just
about finished; (5) directorship of the
Herald because he couldn’t see eye to eye
with his fellow-directors. An earnest Metho-
dist, his platform oratory is evangelistic in
style; but since he attended the wmrld’s most
expensive debating society, the League of
Nations, his manner has been flavored by
a little hauteur.
“Gregor” : The late Nelson Illingworth could
model at lightning speed. At the old Adelphi
one night, when he was behind the scenes, he
modelled in ordinary putty the head and

THE DISGUISED BLESSING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Uproar ensued. Half the members in the House
rose to their feet. Amid the uproar Mr. W. M.
Hughes was heard to remark plaintively that ‘he
could not hear what anybody was saying.’ ’’—Report
of the usual row in the Reps.

Of a tormented soul,

And ask of tears their toll.

This is a tale (in truth, ’tis ta’en
From some old, knowing book)
Of' one whom Allah smote with pain
Within his lowly nook—
A prophet, whose profoundest views
Won little honor, Mister Hughes.
With poverty and dirt he dwelt,
Yet so enriched his mind
No ill he did, nor thought, nor felt;
Yet Allah struck him blind !
The faithful few who heard the news
Were quick to pity, Mister Hughes.
Then spoke that wise man: “God He knew

The sordidness ’twas mine to view;
God knew —and glazed my eyes!”

THE INSULT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It was alleged that Mr. Baddeley had offered
work to the leader of the unempkwed (Mr. Spill-
man). In a strongly-worded resolution Mr. Badde-
ley’s action was described as a ‘miserable trick,’
and ‘an unpardonable sin for a Labor Minister to
commit.’ ” —Report of unemployed meeting.
I’ve toiled for years at being unemployed;
The right to sweat with righteous zeal proclaimed;
A host of politicians I’ve annoyed,
And made our tyrant rulers feel ashamed
With cries of protest that they could not burke—
And now this blackguard comes and offers work!
“A miserable trick”—too soft a phrase
To fit the lowness of this insult base.
I am a martyr, I, who all my days
Am quite content to haunt the market-place
And howl about the lack of work that he,
The soulless shuffler! presses upon me.
But does he think that thus he shall prevail?
No! With proud scorn the bait I now refuse,
And, with a string of scorpions for my flail,
Expose the wicked cunning of the ruse,
And castigate the rotter who would rob
Me of my work by giving me a job!

“D.D.”: I wonder if “C. Coral's” Cam-
bridge anthropologist (B. 17/6/’26) whose linguistic
leg was pulled by a Thursday Island native is the
same “authority” referred to by Dan Crawford,
the African missionary, in one of his books. Glanc-
ing at a list of new African words by an allegedly
good linguist Crawford smiled to see against Eng-
lish “axe” the long phrase “Wa laka vyepi.” Which
means “What are you saying?” There Africa
joins hands with Australia in a common howler,
for our kangaroo received its moniker in the
same way. Some early pioneers, seeing the strange
marsupial hopping away, young in pouch, waved
their arms to the natives, semaphoring the question,
“What is the animal’s name?” Game the reply
“Kang garni?” (“What are you saying?”). Hence
“kangaroo.”
“Chloe”: Mr. T. Hall, of Warwick (Q.),
now 85, is one of the few white men who have
witnessed the rites celebrated within the bora ground.
One such ground, of great importance in the last
century, was in the ranges above Killarney, about
15 miles front Warwick. Its sacred circles were
hidden by belts of thick scrub, and could be reached
only by passing through a winding passage with an
entrance made by tree trunks on which were painted
cabalistic signs. These paintings were done in clay
or raddle mixed with emu oil, and were old as far
back as 1845, the year when the ceremonial was
witnessed. The induction-to-manhood rights lasted
three days. The youths due for this rite were sub-
jected to strenuous tests, including a three days’
fast, before entering the sacred circle. This had
a diameter of about 30ft., with an outer rim Bft.
wide along which the tribal poles were set. Each
pole had its own totem that recorded by signs
the history of individuals who had won dis-
tinction. The youths took their places by their own
pole, and had to prove themselves in the use of
spear, shield and boomerang of their own making.
After having challenged each other on the first day,
they were subjected on the second to an attack by
chosen warriors from their tribe, or from a friendly
tribe related by blood. Those failing became pariahs
for a year, when a second test was given. A second
failure meant the prestige of a camp follower ; the
unfortunate youth was set to all the menial tasks,
such as making weapons, hut building and burden-
bearing for the gins when camp was shifted, and he
had not the privilege of marriage unless one of the
old widows of the camp chose him as mate —her
he dared not refuse. These measures ensured the
physical fitness of the Downs natives, which the',
preserve more or less to the present day.
* * * *
“Sylvester” : The two coekies were bitter
enemies who resorted in turn to every nasty trick
that cantankerous neighbors can think of. Stock
were impounded at every opportunity, and gates left
open. But the crisis was reached when Duncan found
Head’s fancy rooster scratching among his voung
wheat and shot it. He then sent a note over to Read
frigidly requesting him to come and remove the
corpse. Read yoked his six farm bullocks and went
into Duncan’s wheat paddock, where, after a lot
of turning and backing, he managed to get the chain
around the rooster’s neck and snigged it home.
* * * *
“Soled” : A couple of the original settlers
of the Okapua settlement, Canterbury Province
(M.L.)i made some of their first income in a queer
way. Parts of their holdings w r ere drained swamp
land, in which they discovered quantities of moa-
bones. They sent away no less than three truckloads;
every museum in the world seemed to be an eager
buyer of the extinct bird’s last will and testament!
“Gouger”: Wild abo. does not always
butcher a man and eat him solely
because it will make him brave.
Some years back the Bloomfield (N.Q.)
nigs clubbed a Daintree Boy and
enjoyed their repast in the full
understanding that the victim’s phy-
sical strength alone -would pass into
them. He was a notedly powerful
man, but a recognised coward. On
the wild west coast of Cape York
Peninsula my mates and I rode in
on three skinny old men squatting
down to a plump young gin. The
meat, wrapped in wild-banana leaf
to keep in the juices, and spiced
with wild ginger, had just beer,
lifted out of the clay oven. The old
bucks were cornered, but their lingo
told us nothing. They were furious,
too, and seemed afraid that we would
scoff their dinner. We surmised that
they had killed and eaten the girl
either out of gluttony, or else, being
skinny bags of superstition, they
hoped to transfer to themselves her
plump qualities. Later on our
’“civilised” camp boys, with appreci-
ative grins at our discernment
assured us that the latter surmise
was correct. In 1913 at Cape Mel-
ville (C.Y.P.) I lost a valuable
bey, a phenomenal tracker. L
thought he’d simply “gone bush.”
After the war I revisited the locality
and the tribesmen explained how
they’d speared and roasted Jimmy
within half a mile of our old camp,
and since then had been able to
track any living thing “quick feller.”
There always appears to be some
quality in the victim the possession
of which is desired.
“Ajax” : Has anyone ever heard a China-
man whistle? I never have during a fairly extensive
experience of the race. I have asked several if the
accomplishment was beyond them, but never got any
answer but a grin and a “no savee.” Come to that,
I have never heard a dinkum abo. whistle, either.
But one of them, questioned on the subject, was more
informative than the Chows. He threw a dreadful
reflection on his lips.
•*— * *
“James B.”: There is much speculation
locally as to what has become of the Murray cod
which for 50 years were so plentiful in Lake George
and the creeks flowing into it. To account for
there being none in the lake itself is easy, it having
been dry for over 20 years, though now it is a
fine sheet of water again. Millions of fish died as
the waters of the lake receded. Cod 50lb. to 701 b. went
first, and each week showed corpses on a gradually
decreasing scale till the last drop of dirty water
held only the very small fry. That, however, will
not account for their disappearance from the creeks,
where half a century ago it was possible to catch
a hundredweight of fish in an afternoon. Even in
a huge depression on Winderadeen, locally known
as Murray’s Waterhole, in which cod were placed
80 years ago, fish have not been taken for some time
past, though formerly they multiplied exceedingly.
“Jackeroo"': Half a million sheep from
western stations (Q.) are being pastured on the
eastern sugar belt, and others are still coming

CITY GIRL: “Haven't you got anything nice to tell me?”
DAVE: "Tons, but what’s the good? You ain’t a bit interested in

in. For the first time in the history of „ the wool
industry in Bananaland, sugar-cane chaff has been
fed to the merinos. Cane, of unmillable quality
is being used. The present ration is a ton, of chaff
a day to every 1000 sheep (2-|lb. each), and it
costs £4 a ton. This ration not only sustains but
fattens them. It lias, by the way, been found
cheaper to rail the sheep to the canefields than
rail the cane to the sheep.
“Two Seas” : “Jim Carew” (B. 10/6/’261
explains that his home-made dingo tails were passed
for payment by a manager imported' from England ;
but I still doubt if a manager imported even from
Gladesville would have passed such a clumsy
swindle. If a dingo tail was short-haired like
a fox terrier’s, a strip from the hide might deceive
a city bushman ; but it isn’t. Moreover, in skinning
the tail one is apt to
leave the typical
bushy tuft on the
carcase unless one cuts
off an inch or two of
the bone. Did the tail
factory manufacture
the bone? “J. 0.”
suggests that a yarn
with a few old-tiine
bushmen would
quickly convince me
that the swindle was
not only practicable,
but fairly extensively
worked. My own ex-
perienoe on n.-w.
stations (N.S.'VV.)
dates back to the
’eighties, and I never
heard of the home-
made-tail' industry. On
stations where a man’s
dingo . tally was “40
per month for three
years” such pains-
taking energy was
wasted. We used to
muster the dingoes on
those stations and
yard them with “a
running fire of stock-
whips and a fiery run
of hoofs,” and then
draft out as many as
we thought the boss
would pay for that
month without getting
annoyed. The balance of the mob we released.
“Eau-de” : A friend complaining the other
day of the number of his cigarettes that his wife
smoked reminded me of an economical .husband who
had a native wife on one of the South Seh Islands.
He chewed tobacco, his wife smoked. A visitor to
the house could always see a supply of well-chewed
tobacco knots on the window-sill drying for the
wife’s pipe.
“Wilga”: I have been keeping a spider
in a gauze enclosure for a considerable time with
interesting results. When I lightlj r sprinkled the
roof with water so
that moisture drip-
ped and hung on the
slender threads below,
the spinner soon re-
paired and renewed
broken portions of uer
web. If I failed to pro-
vide the moisture, no
new T web was added
and old rents were
allowed to remain. I
kept a piece of cheese
or bacon hanging in
the cage, and small
flies entered and were
trapped. Weevils, too,
helped to provide food.
Although quite alone
for about six months,
this spider spun a
cocoon of oval shape,
placed her eggs in it,
and young spiders were
hatched. They lived
in the cocoon tor a
time, but would often
collect about the body
of their mother as
though they received
some nourishment from
her, which may have
been possible and may
account for her thirst.
Anyway, she was just
as ravenous for food
and water after the
little ones appeared as
she had been before
the completion of the
cocoon. While still
able to pass in and
out of the gauze, the
little spiders left their
cage for good—not one
remained with its
mother. She herself
did not want to leave ;
that sort of easy life
was good enough for
her, gauze or no
gauze.
“Hiawatha” : Can any Councillor tell me
what makes the millions of frail threads that can
be seen of a winter’s day attached to every clod
in a ploughed paddock? After ploughing ground
I have seen them within about 10 minutes, joining
the clods. The threads, do not appear to be made by
spiders; at any rate, I have never been able to find
them.
“Homfrey Beale” : A man I know bought
a watch and wore it for four months. It was
constantly stopping, despite the fact that he wound
it regularly. During the time he had it he was
seriously ill for about five weeks, and kept the
watch on a table near the bed. It went regularly
for the whole of that period, but on the owner
recovering and again wearing it the watch at once
HIS WATCH HAD CHANGED HANDS.
BARRISTER FOR THE DEFENCE : “What time was it when you were
attached?”
THE ATTACKED : “I don't know. Ask your client —he took my
watch.”
recommenced its stop-work tactics. The owner men-
tioned the matter in a pub one day, and a bystander
bought the ticker offhand. For him it behaved
admirably. His explanation is that the original
owner is hyper-magnetic and that the watch-spring
is of particularly sympathetic steel. He says he has
known similar cases. Has he got the true explana-
tion ?

I wonder if in isles of bliss,
Where fronded palms wave to and fro,
Where silvery sands the waters kiss
And scented breezes ever blow,
The ghosts of all the cars we’ve had
Roll swift on roads of pearly shell,
And purr in their contentment glad
’Twixt rows of glorious asphodel ?
If not, where are they, tell me, pray,
Where are the cars of yesterday !
Car ages, filled with steering wheels,
Worn cylinders and piston rings,
And horns that sounded raucous peals,
And universal joints and springs
Are but the earthly resting-place
Where their old bones in peace may rust.
Elsewhere their spirits keep their pace.
They must be running still, they must
In some fair clime; oh, far away,
Still live the cars of yesterday !
For if the minds that built these cars
Live on and on in glory’s light
Out past the ever-blazing stars
Upon the everlasting height,
These children born in thoughts of men
Must with a new life be infused.
So, filled with joy, we’ll ride again
In all the cars we’ve ever used.
Along fair sands, kissed by the spray,
We’ll drive the cars of yesterday.

Cyanide) is that it kills every rabbit m the burrows, no matter
how large the burrows are. I have dug the
rabbits out of my farm (200 acres). I used
the slb. I bought from you in the largest
burrows, and after digging out the smaller
ones I decided to dig out the large ones, and
in every instance found the rabbits all dead.
I got as many as 32 in one burrow. I can

The TOP'NOTCH'ScotcM
“Eau-de”: Modern followers of jazz
appear to be able to step for hours if provided with
plenty of noise in regular time. Those aboard the
Malabar, bound from Singapore to Melbourne, lately
found things not so with the abos. at Thursday
island. A missionary offered to let his boys give
a dance aboard for the benefit of the passengers.
The boys required a tin to beat time on, so a
steward produced a biscuit “empty.” The boys, after
trying for a few minutes to keep step by it, had
lo send a special messenger ashore for a kerosene-
tin. “That other one not proper,” they declared.
* * * *
“Png”: Why is not more interest taken
in zebu blood in breeding tick-proof cattle? Any-
thing with even one quarter zebu blood is immune,
the parasite being unable to mature on them, and
their fine clean skins show up in marked contrast to
those of ordinary cattle. In the present state of the
labor market in the North, dipping is expensive and
the small cattleman feels it heavily. Zebu beef is
light in color, and in the opinion of practically all
who eat it superior to ordinary ox meat. The cattle
are tractable, though curious, and their habit of
running up to a horse and rider has earned them an
undeserved reputation as chargers. The zebu matures
and fattens quickly, and is ready for market from
I hvee to six months before other breeds. Up on the
llaintree, where the rich panicum-grass flats regularly
carry three beasts to the acre alt the year round,
Fischer Bros,, with a small herd, are using these
“BTRUTH, IF THASH CLOCK'SH RI, I'M TOO LATE
HAVE ANUZZER ONE (HIC)!"
cattle with almost ideal results —there are no
droughts, no disease and no losses. Louis Fischer,
a shrewd Australian, is now culling out everything
that is without zebu blood, and with his facts before
me I can see no flaw in the policy. His “store”
country is kangaroo-grass land in the back ranges,
and there the zebu has shown that he can stay fat
while other cattle die of drought. Surely here is
one importation that is deserving of encouragement
or at least investigation.
EASILY EXPLAINED.
WITTE PFELLER : “What wakes the day so short, Jackie?"
BLACK PEELLER: “Ah, cripe, too much win' blowem sun over 100-pfella quick."
“Murrungurry": It was a hot day. and
Bung, of a well-known pub on the Maranoa, after
looking vainly up and down tlie road for a chance
customer, took his boots off and went to sleep on
the verandah. The boots were strong bluchers he
had worn only about a week. When he woke they were
gone, and in their place was an old pair with
gaping toes, worn-down heels and broken soles.
Bung stared at them for some seconds. Then he
hurled them at the road, and rushed around: but
all he found was the track of his boots in the dust.

tide and currents made
off with six eases of
opium. Of four of these
the public heard little,
but two had an inter-
esting history. They
were picked up first by
a well-known resident
of Moss m a n, who,
assisted by a N'.Q.
nigger, promptly buried
them. The nigger re-
tailed the secret to a
Jap fisherman, who dug
them up and replanted
them. Other tongues
carried the story to the
owners, who again dis-
interred the plant, and
part of the consign-
ment found its way
home at last. In their
search the smugglers
had scoured the coast-
line from Cairns to
Cooktown, incidentally
smashing a small
launch on a reef. As
an opium port, Sydney is a piker beside Cairns. T.'p
here the risk is practically nil.

“Rainbow Trout’’: Re “Larrapinta’s” in-
quiry (B. 20/5/’’26). The ski-makers at Mt. Feather-
top and St. Bernard (Vic.) use red mountain-ash,
known as Victorian “woollybutt,” which, though easy
to work, is exceedingly tough. The mail was carried
from Harrietville to Dargo for years on a pair of
these good woollybutt skis.
“Doric" : There are still a few old-timers
of the Upper Murray; district who will remember the
screaming woman of the Ivoetong Ranges. As a
weird legend of the Australian bush it, can be placed
in the same categoyy as Fisher’s Ghost. Some
drovers, while taking stock across the mountains,
were awakened one flight by blood-curdling shrieks,
just as if a woman was being tortured. Investigation
in the morning revealed nothing, and their story was
laughed at. Presently, however, other travellers went
through the same uncanny experience. As soon as
the. tents were pitched and darkness set in the
screams would start, the horses would stampede and
the sheep scatter in all directions. A couple of
timber-cutters, after: spending several nights of
terror, fled, and could never be induced to return for
their loading, although it was of considerable value.
One theory was that the spook was a lunatic at
large, who used to hide by day and' haunt the hills
at night; another was that a strange bird was
responsible. Though the nocturnal sounds lasted for
several years, their origin was never definitely fixed.
“Galil”: Talk about mugs’ luck! Two
ncwehums went for an afternoon’s shooting in South
Aus. recently. They missed not only everything
aimed at, but also the trail home, and were lost in the
bush. Though suffering from hunger, they had come
to their final cartridge without having registered a
kill. Their ease looked bad, when the one possessing
the last of the cartridges tripped, causing his cocked
gun to explode its charge. They were amazed to see
a hare in its death throes several yards away —killed
by the unintentional shot.
* * * *
“M.L.C.”: I read with interest “Ragar’s”
testimony to the medicinal virtues of the lantana
leaf (B. 10/6/’26). Doubtless many remedies are
at hand in the bush if - only they were better
known. Cases have come within my experience where
a poultice made of sawdust from the Huon-pine has
been effective in healing festered wounds. The
timber-fellers in the Speck say that if they cut them-
selves when working any timber except Huon-pine
the wound almost invariably festers, whereas pine
injuries heal readily. An oil is distilled from this
wood, and is much in. request for syringing horses
that have been staked. The beautiful tree is, how-
ever, now confined to the little explored country
s.-w. of Macquarie Harbor.
* * * *
“Pick": In some instances the efforts of
pioneers in Australia have gone for nothing. In
the early ’fifties an offer of £5O made by Jimmy
Manning, manager for the Twofold Bay Co. (X.S.W.),
to the first teamster shipping Monaro wool from that
port, induced Joe Jeffreys, one of the plateau bul-
loekies, to reach for the shekels. After weeks of
exploring the South Coast ranges, he selected the
Tnntawangle Valley as the least difficult pass to, the
sea. Alone he spanned deep creeks with sapling
bridges, corduroyed Packer’s and Badgerv Swamps,
and cut miles of tracks through scrub and jungle.
Then with a 14-bale load of Bibbenluke wool on a
dray drawn by 12 bullocks he set out to overcome
the supposedly impassable difficulties. Often with
block and tackle he had'to lower his bales down
declivities, or haul them back when they rolled down
the slopes. His track was well marked by saplings
felled to replace broken poles and guard-rails. After
months of toil he landed his much-bedraggled load
at the bay. A zigzag road constructed and maintained
at great cost, along which Monaro and Riverina wool
subsequently was drawn, followed Jeffreys’s track.
Stores, blacksmiths’ shops, pubs, shanties and the
beginnings of a township sprang up, and lines of
teams passed along the devious way. Now, however,
the round-about Bombala railway has knocked out
the carrying industry ; the teamsters have turned to
other pursuits, and the port of Twofold Bay, one of
the best on the shores of Australia, still awaits the
city that, should adorn its foreshores.
* * * *
“Louden”: A long-whiskered cow-cocky
who bogs in for a sou’-west Groperland football
team refuses to admit that the Australian game is
only for youth. “Yairs,” drawled the hardy vet-
eran in answer to a question of mine while he was
dressing after a game, “I can go the pace orlright
and stand all the knocks. The worst part I iind
is gettin’ the mud out of me whiskers Sundee
mornin’s.”
* * * *
“Werrimee": Many drovers have been
eulogised for their small loss of stock on long
trips, but I nominate Jerry Conolly for the
cleanest record. He started from the Northern
Territory with 1224 bullocks, and after travelling
1900 miles delivered 1220 at Muswellbrook (N.S.W.)
in first-class condition. The other four were
drowned while swimming a flooded river. As a con-
trast, in the early ’nineties some town drovers
started from Bulgroo (Q.) with 600 rushers, and
after three days on the road had none.
“Neil”: Nettie Palmer, in her excellent
article on saving our place names (Red Page,
17/6/’26), concluded by saying: “The new crusaders
might lead off by settling the tangled history of
the lovely but dubious name ‘Nimitybelle.’ ” About
10 years ago the schoolmaster at Nimrnitabel, A. O.
Harvey, set an example to his calling throughout
the Commonwealth by compiling a history of the
township from the time of the first settler to the
coming of the railway. Unfortunately all the abos.
had disappeared before his time; but from the
evidence he collected, much of it contradictory, it
appeared that thq abo. word was Nimmitabel, mean-
ing the division of the waters. For years this was
changed to Ximit'y Belle, no doubt by people who
had a prejudice against native words owing to a
vague feeling that their use might lead away from
civilisation. But with the coming of the railway, the
original word was used in naming the station,
and it has since' then come into general use.
“Conger": With conditions favorable,
Binghi can smell '•'animals an extraordinary distance
away. Different beasts emit different odors, and I’ve
known abos. who could name treed animals by the
sense of smell alone. They can also differentiate
between white men, black, yellow and brown. J
remember a case in Cape York Peninsula where one
located a prospector friend of mine (dead) in a
waterhole. “Me smell him white-man fat,’’ he
declared. Most abos. can smell smoke from afar,
and recognise the different grass or timber being
burned. Strangely enough, the older men have the
acuter smell perception. I have known old gins to
unerringly smell out birds and tree animals where
there was not the slightest visible sign of them,
and I "knew one ancient gin who could distinguish
unseen wild cattle from buffalo, and even correctly
tell the sex of the animals.
GIVE THE MAN TIME.
JOKER: “Well, as you're a good rider, I'll-
put you up on Maneater, the nastiest
horse in the district. But I can't say
you're looking awfully bucked about it!"
VICTIM : “I shall be — I shall be."
“Ker” : Hayseed had left f his vehicle out-
side a Cootamundra (N.S.W.) pub, and was much
perturbed when a cop took his rfime and address for
not having his wheel chained. '“Just like ther law,”
he said —“pickin' on er strugglin' cocky! Why
don’t yer take ther names er some of them motor
'ogs ? I ain’t seen any er with their wheels
chained 1”
THE WOMAN WHO SELDOM CRIED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Short-lashed were the eyes of old Ann Bolan,
The cold pale blue that’s as hard as flint;
Lined was her face with a score of wrinkles,
Tell-tale lines of long years of stint.
Stern was her gaze and straight and steady,
The gaze of a woman who never lies;
Square was her jaw and firm and bony,
The jaw of a woman who seldom cries.
Made a widow before she was thirty—
She nursed her man and she saw him die—
Stern was her voice to the weeping children,
(trim was her face, but she did not cry.
She faced her task with a heart unflinching—
She was left with a debt, and a hungry brood—
When the bleak winds' blew the kids may have
whimpered,
But their wail was never the cry for food.
Half through the night she patched and mended,
Her days were spent by the wash-house tub
Till her muscles ached and her fingers stiffened—
They were almost raw with the endless rub.
Her children grew as the years were passing
And drifted off till she kept but one;
And for him she saved what she earned, hard toiling •
He was her hope and her only son.
Blurred are the eyes of old Ann Bolan;
Her head is bowed and her form has shrunk.
Her sleeve is wet where the tears have fallen
For a puny weakling, babbling drunk.
With a grim set face, she watched them bring him
Home to her threshold, and then depart ;
And the square jaw dropped and the thin lip quivered
And hers was the cry of a broken heart.
N.S.w.
JIM GRAHAME.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

SILK
STOCKINGS
In u blur of rain that refused to be dried
by the icy wind, the Polo season started at
Kensington last week-end. Up and down
the sodden field flashed the gallant ponies
carrying the sky-blues of Inverell, the pinks
of Cooma, the royal-blues of Muswellbrook,
the mauve and straw of Sydney. In the
swiftly wheeling tangle of color at Ken-
sington on Saturday thrilling moments were
provided when Goulburn Squares and Goul-
burn Stripes fought to a finish what was
a great victory for the Ashton clan, the
whole four who carried the red and blue
stripes in this match being sons of Jimmy,
M.LiC. Ken Austin, too, received his
meed of applause for the dash which
he brought to the defence of Sydney A. The
vice-regal stand, which on Friday, in
common with all of Sydney, was under-
water, on Saturday was inhabited by the
G.-G. and Lady Stonehaven. Later in the
afternoon the State Ex. added herself and
Elaine to the befurred throng. For, of
course, furs and leather or tweed coats and
velour hats were the only wear. Clarice
Faithfull put a warm splash into the grey
day ; with her scarlet jerkin, and coral reds
were the cheery note struck by dark Marcia
Allen. Richness exuded from Mrs. Otway
Falkiner s sealskins, and the same sleek
animal protected pretty Valerie Purves of
Melbourne. Elaine de Chair’s cheeks shone
rosy above Quaker browns, and the green
tailorings of Mrs. Din Garvan were warmed
by fox of distinguished family. Browns
and greens seemed first favorites, and one of
the smartest wearers of the first was Mrs.
Jim Litchfield of Cooma. Mrs. Colin
Stephen was another of the richly furred,
and a Paisley coat of many colors was worn
by Mrs. Bell Johnson of Moss Vale.
After Monday’s polo everybody’s car
headed for the Palais, where billies had been
boiled by 63 hostesses for 900 guests.
In splatters of sleety rain the guests kept
streaming in till after five o’clock. Sir
Dudley, Lady de Chair and Elaine were
among the later arrivals. Lady de Chair and
her daughter had green frocking covered
with chin-liigh furs, and finished off with
black velvet hats. The dressing was exactly
as it had been on the field, the heroes of the
day arriving in their polo togs. Out of the
crowds that danced or clustered about the
tea tables the Persian red silk of Penelope
Cay’s frock that found a soothing climax in
her black velvet hat, the vivid jades worn by
Mrs. Leslie Walford and the attractive
white felt hat of Betty Lamb continually
arrested the eye. Other attractions were
Mrs. Leslie Willsallen, Dorothea Mackellar
and the blonde Mrs. Alan Potter in her blue-
green tailorings.
An overpowering success w-as the Back-
hauls concert on Saturday night. The en-
thusiasm was something in the nature of an
electric charge—staid, elderly ladies shouted
“bravos,” and a member of the vice-regal
group (both Admiralty House and the Mac-
quarie-street pile were represented) burst
her thirty-two-and-sixpenny white kids at
the conclusion of the Rachmaninoff Prelude.
In the artists’ room after the concert the
autograph-hunter mobbed the gentle but tired
little pianist, who with bowed head wrote his
name feverishly till a horrified manager came
to the rescue. The girl- and boy-students from
theigallery seats who seized the golden oppor-
tunity of the unguarded door were not nearly
so blameworthy in this respect as some im-
pressive ladies from the expensive front
seats were.
.The great tone-master Backhaus was given
his first Sydney ovation by the Musical
Association last week. The unassuming
man, who in looks bears a resemblance to
Beethoven, proved a very shy speaker. His
wife, too, a clever musician in her own right
depends more on the soft smile than on the
spoken word. They are an amiable pair, and
arc already linked with Australia by kind-
nesses to Australian musicians in other parts
of the world. One of these —Dorothy Ken-
nedy, who was Dorothy Mcßride—-writes
feelingly of the great one’s helping hand.
sjMl a dog Lang and Shirley Bavin would
still love him. It was mainly to the
daughter of the leader of the Opposition that
the Animal Ball at the Palais on Friday
owed its glittering success. Vice-royalty came
to the party, and bulldogs and the pony
Smoke. The last two items arc possession’s
ol J. L. Bendrodt, the head sheik of the
Palais. The bull puppies had great fun ou
the cleared floor with a balloon that they
pretended was a football—just to amuse the
foolish humans. The Government House
party had come on from the Kambala ball,
and the frocking of the ladies was precisely
as it had been at the former address. Betty
\\ llson was the secretary of the dance, and
i enelope Cay its treasurer: and a commit-
tee ot gn-ls as pretty as pictures helped the
night's achievement.
In its sequinned and beaded mist of rain-
bow-hues, the Kambala Ball caught the
.state vice-regals, a visiting millionaire, a
real Russian prince and a princess by mar-
riage. So you can guess the . glow tliat the
Ambassadors basked in last Friday night.
Sir Dudley and Lady de Chair arrived
early bringing with them daughter Elaine
and Captain Penfold. They were met by
an impressive group of the School’s Council
headed by President of the Ball Mrs. Riddle,
who dressed her act in a tunic suit of ivory
georgettes emblazoned with a lacquer-red
design. In Lady de Chair’s jocund raiment
an opal coronet, periwinkle-blue satins and
lame with the dull burnish of pewter were
combined with results to be commanded.
Elaine was a froth of ivory georgettes and
silver, and Sir Dudley and the willowy aide
depended on their kind hearts and their
haunting smiles to carry them through.
The revellers in the ballroom above Sargent’s
in Market-street last Thursday had something
more than pie and coffee for their supper. A
beano that started with oyster patties and
finished with fruit in the skin it was born in
is still being cooed about by the committee of
the Women’s Country Club Ball. The room
itself, very graceful since its elongation, wore
wall panels of palms, aud in their shadow
sprang a rich undergrowth of green and red
and yellow paper caps and tossing balloons.
Nearly 200 club members turned up, many
of them real-merino country-women in town
for the sheep sales or polo. ’Flu kept Mrs.
Earle Page, who is the club’s chieftainess,
from putting in an appearance; secretary
Mrs. \al Osborne and Airs. Fenton Spencer
bore the heat and burden of the night with
wreathed smiles.
Tiie two great events of the Movie Ball
were stage-managed uof to clash. The ball
was its own crowded, colorful and carefree
self and started powdering its nose under
the Palais lights at eight. At nine came the
State Exes, and the National Anthem, the
skyscraping Captain Penfold in attendance.
And at 9.30, without even one war-whoop to
announce them, entered a group of real Red
Indians. These are circling the earth in
company with a film that calls them “The
Vanishing Race.” Very different indeed the
nervous little company looked from child-
hood visions of that one who was Last of the
Mohicans and of him who was known to his
world as the Deerslayer. Verv up-to-date
in one respect, however —they brought the
baby. Babies in and out of fanev costume
were quite a feature of the ball. One small
tot of about three, masquerading as a page
before a lavishly garnished Potentate of the
Orient, was almost stepped upon by a dash-
ing Duke of Richmond in shell-pink satins
and plumes. He of the swinging cloak fell
back hastily, crying: “Greetings, Sardine!”
This is Isobel Gawler, the girl who
touched the hearts of Play box audiences as
she played the
name-part in
the production
of "Prunella”
at the Rowe-
street theatre.
In the garden
of box hedges
clipped in the
Dutch fashion
designed and
painted by
Erik Langker,
she made as
fascinating a
heroine of
symbol and
fantasy as the
authors, Lau-
rence Hous-
man and Gran-
ville Barker,
could have
wished. To the
prescient sad-
ness underlying the gaiety of the Pierrot of
Duncan Macdougall, she was as flint to steel,
and the two never for a moment lost sight
of the thread of poetry on which the moon-
beam fabric hung.
The arrangements for “Shore’s” dance this
year were beyond reproach. The committee
had looked to it that there were not so many
tickets sold as to interfere with dancing
comfort, and the Ambassadors on Monday
night was. at its best. The Principal of
“Shore,” with Mrs. Robson, entertained a
great party, most of them representing other
high scats of learning. Mrs. Robson
hostessed the highbrows from a Paquin
structure of black georgettes splashed with
silver. Nell Cobcroft danced like blue thistle-
down in a high wind. Turquoise green
with a begemmed girdle was worn by Bee
Gonroy, whose brother Neville was one of the
active committee. There never has been
a jollier rally under the old school’s banner.
The stageful of bouquets which sur-
rounded Dot Brunton at the Palace on
Saturday night included some fine floral de-
signs, one of them a trellised arrangement
with “Dorothy” worked in white flowers, but
there was no offering better than the one
which Guy Bates Post, with the tears of a
proud tutor in his eyes, weaved for her. Dot
returned the compliment with an unaffected
acknowledgment of Guy Bates Post's en-
couragement and tutelage; but her most
charming act was the manner in which,
from the first flowers that came to her. she
threw a bunch into one of the boxes. Her
mother was there.
This is Helena Stewart, who will sing the
name-part at the Philharmonic production
of “Aida" at
tho Town Hall
on the 21st.
She owns an
unusually fine
dramatic so-
prano, which
has been heard
in Maoriland
as well as in
.V. -S. Wales.
Last week a
concert in
Goulburn. at
whi c h sh c
was a star
artist, was
broadcasted by
Farmer's, and
back - country
admirers art'
still sending
in congratula-
tions. Last
April Mi s s
Stewart made a big hit in the Philharmonic
performance of Berlioz’s “Faust,” in which
she was Margaret—and sang the, part with-
out even a glance at the score.
The Ward and Fullers had the press
people who are interested in theatrical work
to lunch at Paris House to meet the
“Abie’s Irish Rose” co., which paused on its
long flight to Melbourne; and a w T ell-fed
flock thumped the table enthusiastically
when Hugh Ward, towards the end, sug-
gested that such meetings ought to happen
much oftener. There was no overloading
of advertisement about the affair, although
Ben Fuller announced the firm’s intentions
regarding the upper theatre of the St. James’s
building, incidentally remarking that it was
a shame the co. should have to go to, Scot-
land to have the carpets for the new show-
house woven, The people concerned in the
proposed carpet-weaving industry in Tas-
mania should keep the Ward-Fullers in mind.
About the most successful speech of the day
was made by the thespian who plays the
Jewish father- he explained that he couldn’t
make a speech because his hands were sore
-from carrying his “grips.”
Bast (Wednesday) evening. Kathleen Fitz-
hafdinge, youngest daughter of the Moreton
Fitzhardinges of Summer Hill, gave a
retainer to barrister Wilfred Sheppard of
this city. The proceedings took place in
old St, James's Church, while cousin Dorothy
Fitzhardinge warbled a song of Thanksgiv-
ing. The bridal gown was a shimmer' of
satin romaine a-glitter with a hoar frost of
jewelled trimming. Over the Juliet cap
floated a century-old lace veil—-of romantic
history—lent by Mrs. Fred Carr of Bris-
bane. Bridesmaid Betty Braddock and her
companion, Nancy Daly moved softly in
clouds of mauve and pink chiffon.
Hobson’s choice last week at St. James’s
in King-street couldn’t have been better be-
cause he was Best. Captain Arthur are the
approaches to the surname, and he’s the
second son of Knight Robert Best of Mel-
bourne. His bride. Jessie Hobson, of Mel-
bourne, mingled silver lace and faintest lilac
in her dress, and Honiton lace and tulle in
her veil. Two young matrons of honor, Mrs.
Harry Davey and Mrs. Leo Elliott, glowed
pinkly in her wake, and the Ambassadors
spread fizz and dripping.
Arum-lilies and blonde brides mingle with
a suavity that is beyond words. So Mollie
Rutherford had the right setting at All
Saints’, in Woollahra, the other night when
she allowed tall, blue-eyed Breezy (Frederick
Richardson) Gale, of Melbourne, to endow
her with all his wordly goods and a
wedding-ring. The rich ivory sheen that is
known as crepe Stella was fashioned into the
full skirt and the tight little bodice of the
’thirties. There were also the fashionable
transparent hem of silver lace hiding vet
revealing the bridal ankles, and a cobwebby
train of tulle and silver lace weighted with
plump dewdrops which if you were mundane
you named rhinestones and silver ‘sequins.
Still another link binds MacPliillamy to
MacPhillamy. Bright-eyed Mrs. Suttor, once
Kitty MacPhillamy of Gorman’s Hill, Bath-
urst, last week charged her name hack again
by wedding Neil MacPhillamy, of Warroo,
Forbes. St. Stephen's administered first aid to
the unmarried, with soulful-organ music sup-
plied by Mr. Chandler. Powder-blue geor-
gettes, pearl inlaid, and an alluring hat in
which black crinoline and tulle were wedded
adorned the bride. Bride’s niece Tassie
MacPhillamy ’maided, Usher’s drew the
corks, and the Arthur Allens’ cottage at Port
Hacking adds still another honeymoon to its
collection. Neil MacPhillamy is one of the
best amateur riders in the State, and a fre-
quent winner at picnic races.
Following her Scott Fell cousin’s example,
Mabel Helen Fell, second daughter of David,
who himself married into the English
nobility a few years back, has engaged her-
self —to Douglas James Robertson Doyle, of
Clevedon, Gresford.
St. Mark’s, Darling Point, was prinked
ont on Monday night for the linking up of
Yere Eleanor Tewksbury to Lieut. Harold
Exton Turner, R.N. Archdeacon D’Arcy
Irvine soldered the link, and the bride’s father
gave her away—a frothy cascade of tulle
and ivory laces—to the young man from
England.
The candles round a birthday-cake make
a noticeable illumination when one is 88.
And that’s just the number that circled cake
and table when Walterus Brown, well-known
country police-magistrate, born on the Parra-
matta River, received congratulations the
other day. The birthday gathering was held
at the Golden Shower tearooms, and the
Brown clan in all its ramifications turned
up with shining eyes.
Major Berryman topped the class in the
recent competitive exam, for younger officers
who want to have a couple of years’ staff-
corps training in India. He goes to Quetta
later in the year, and does three months’
duty at Thursday Island meanwhile.
The seals entranced the small girl and boy
who were being piloted about the Zoo by a
youthful uncle who wore a cooing blue shirt
and a rich surf tan. “Uncle,” said the smail
girl, suddenly, “is that water very deep?”
“Oh yes, Binkie, it’s very deep.” “Is it as
high as over my head, Uncle?” “Yes, higher
than that.” “As high as over your head?”
"Yes.” “As high as over God’s head?” The
uncle looked embarrassed and temporised.
“Well, I don’t know, Binkie.” The small
girl decided to solve the problem herself.
With a forget-me-not eye she swept the
space between the sporting seals and the ter-
races of blue sky. “No,” she exclaimed de-
cidedly, “it’s not as high as over God's head.
God is very tall- —it’s probably just about to
Ilis ankles.”
Miss Brisbane’s merry-go-ronnd :
Brisbane was all a-blowing and a-glowing on
triday, our Wattle Day, which brought with it a
cold wind but real northern sunshine. The rain
came at just the light moment for wattle gold this
year.
Pavlova is staying at Lennon’s, and opens at. His
Majesty’s on the 12th. George Matheson and his
wife are back in Brisbane for the re-opening of
the theatre with the dancer.
The Levuka, which has “gone south’’ for good,
having been soid out of the Australian service,
made quite an affecting departure last week. A
crowd collected at the Eagle-street wharf. Hun-
dreds went on board to renew old memories of old
voyages, and Captain Newberry broadcasted a fare-
well. When the steamer moved away, one of her
stewards came on to the deck and played “Lights
Out” on his cornet, all the boats along the water-
front blew" their sirens, and “Auld Lang Syne”
followed the steamer up the river. Captain Camp-
bell Thomson, who took charge of her when she
first came to Queensland in 1910, w r as on the
wharf.
The A.T.N.A. collected bunches of wattle and
poinsettia and many palms for its shivoo in the
Albert Hall, and the association’s monogram was
done in flowers on the platform. J. E. England
lifted his fine baritone voice in song, and pretty
Grizel Gibson was amongst the elocutors. Misses
E. Chatfield and E. Barron played hostess, and
there was a big roll-up of doctors’ wives.
After its mixed foursomes, the Royal Queens-
land Golf Club danced in the Club house. The Eric
Annings, the Symeses, the A. C. Williamses
(U.S.A.), the Perrys and Mary Cameron were
amongst the jazzers.
The Grammar School old boys and girls had a
dance in royal and light blue setting in hall and
library, a mass of golden jonquils decking the
supper-room, The headmaster and Mrs. Bousfield
beamed upon old pupils.
The Yacht Club held its dance the same night—
its dance and a buffet supper.
And there have been private dances by the dozen.
Gladys Pollard, now married to Dr. Donald
Cameron, of Wickham-terrace, is spending her honey-
moon in the South. She is a dark beauty and comes
of a good-looking Warwick family. One sister is
married to another doctor, W. N T . Robertson.
Mrs. Cullen, of Warwick, Q., well over four-
score and mother of seven children, still enjoys
her bridge and croquet. She was a daughter of
the first editor of the Moreton Bay Free Press.
Her father gave up editing to settle on the land
in N. S. Wales. Miss Meston rode with her father
from Brisbane, and on the way visited Henry
N’ieol’s station, Ballandean. There she had her
romance; she met her future husband and soon
made the return journey to Brisbane on horse-
back to purchase her trousseau —rather difficult to
transport in those days, as crinolines were in, and
large poke bonnets. They were carried, neverthe-
less, and a parson who rode 200 miles tied a knot
at Ballandean homestead that never came undone.

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
Phones Cotral 1532, 1533.
Baron Somers tackled his job in earnest
when he aroused the State Parliament from
its long rest. It looked as if members might
have slept for ever but for the fortuitous
arrival of a new Gov. and the necessity for
finding something he could wear his cocked
hat at. There was the usual early-door rush
of excited females to gloat upon the pageant.
The Gov.’s uniform and the crimson tunics
of his aides gave frills and color to the
scene; and the new Lady of Stonington, in
frock and millinery of holly red, was a patch
of brightness amid the sombre-frocked group
on the floor of the House.
His Ex. having read his speech, very
quickly but very nicely, he and Lady Somers
and party were fed with tea and cakes by
the Leg. Council President and his wife,
the hostess being an attractive study in pink.
Mrs. E. 11. Davidson, who accompanied Lady
Somers, wore a purple felt hat with an
ensemble suit of black satin. Premier Allan’s
wife’s black raiment was- embellished with
skunk, the Peacock dame’s black gown also
sported fur, and ex-Attorney-General Robin-
son’s lady topped a kaslia-eloth suit with a
velvet headpiece of burgundy tone. Almost
everyone else wore a coat, and the frocking
wasn’t visible.
Already the Somers family is finding that
Stonington, the Malvern mansion, rented by
tire State at £2OOO a year, is none too roomy.
What with his Ex., his wife and the threc-
year-old chick, the private sec. and family
(four all told) and two gent-helps, space
is wanted for nine, without counting the
domestic staff. The lease has a little more
than 21 months to run. By then, or sooner,
it may be possible for Vic. to regain posses-
sion of its own vice-regal home on St. Kilda-
road, now lent to the Commonwealth rent
free. At any rate, it is assumed that after
the departure of the Federal Parliament
and Government for ’Berra the Stonehavens
will give up the big house in Melbourne.
The new Excellencies faced their first big wel-
coming one afternoon last week, when Mayor
Brunton and his popular wife collected about
300 of the sort of folk that are called “repre-
sentative” to drink tea at the Windsor with
the State's social heads. The big lounge
was transfigured with a wonderful lot of
early-flowering *’Coota wattle, which, with
gum-tips, was displayed in brassware. The
Governor’s lady, who had been handed a
posy of pansies and pink roses, wore a
kasha coat over a frock of fawn georgette
and lace, and a hat of deep rose hue with
gold banding. A powder-blue coat-frock with
beaver fur additions, and a blue feather
dangling from mole velvet, formed the
apparel of the Brunton lady. After an orgy
of hand-shaking in the lounge there was a
surge to the dining-hall, where the chief
table was almost buried in pink roses, irises
and native heath. His Ex. made a good im-
pression with some modest words and the
hotel orchestra and contralto Madame Gregor
Wood filled interludes with harmony. The
Chief Justice, the Federal Attorney-General
and Mrs. Latham, the Stan. Argyles, and
Alec Peacock and his wife were among those
round the special board, and Mrs. Napier,
wife of the new Rear-Admiral, was glimpsed.
Some regal furs were worn, many with
posies of violets and early primroses fas-
tened at the collar.
The Naldera loomed cheerfully out of the
fog at Prince’s Pier on Friday night all
dressed up for the guinea hop to help the
Children’s Hospital. Gaily-decorated stalls
were brigands’ caves at which the public
declined to buy balloons, sweets, jazz-caps
and Parisian dolls in fancy dress at the
peril of their lives. There were two decks
for dancers, a concert in the music-room and
cards elsewhere. The new Governor and
his lady came, she with a long string of
diamonds sparkling against a frock of fine
black lace and crepe de Chine; Mrs. David-
son, who accompanied her, wore a gown en-
riched with straying diamente. Betty
Shackell, Kathleen Currie and Jean Law-
rence, who secretaried, favored frocks of the
pink of early dawn. Wraps were a neces-
sity, and Spanish and Italian shawls com-
peted with cloaks of brocade whose floral
patterning gleamed with silver and gold.
The Charles Lempriere dame, who was of
the workers, had a wonderful cloak over her
gold lace and lame gown, and Marie Greene’s
wrap was brocade of scarlet and gold. Ella
Shields, who piped some ditties, garbed her
trim form iu ermine. Frocks displayed more
garters and lingerie than has been usual
this year. Ventriloquist Coram and Decima
and Eddie McLean did their bit to amuse
the guests.
Saturday’s Grand National meeting at
Flemington was a parade of furs under grey
skies. Lengthy wrap-over cloaks of squirrel
and mink (every hair worth its weight in
gold) made eyes open in amazement, almost
as great as that occasioned by the spectacle
of the favorites tailing the field in the day’s
big race. The new Governor and Lady
Somers had their first plunge into Australia’s
ruling passion. They lunched with the
V.R.C. committee at a table prettified with
pink roses, irises and heath. Her Ex. was
sportslike in coat and skirt of fawn and
brown tweed, with fox necklet and beige felt
hat. Mrs. Davidson wore a tailor-made of
navy with a white pencil-stripe, and milli-
nery of biscuit-colored felt. Nothing new
in winter modes was on parade, save per-
haps the coat-frocks with deep capes
affected by folk lately returned from abroad.
One of these. was the Stuart Murrays’
daughter, whose turnout was navy-blue gab-
ardine with pipings of black military braid
and corresponding cloth liat. Nine out of
ten of the fair sex wore the coat posy. Vio-
lets were much in favor, followed by daphne
and orchids. Once again a few daring souls
gave Russian boots an outing. Whether
affiliated with long coats, tweed, cloth, velvet
or even a marmot-fur skirt they were
fashionable failures.
The Arts and Crafts celebrated its change
of address to Bourke-street by holding an
exhibition of members’ work and inviting
Lady Somers to the kick-off. Her Ex.’s neat:
little speech was quite to the point and
showed knowledge of the subject. Her
attire was a jumper suit of fancy black
fabric with a sable necklet and pastel-toned
hat. One of Mrs. Henrietta Walker’s bark
baskets filled with wattle and heath was
a memento of her introduction to the soci-
ety. Hand-woven linen scarves and articles
in batik, with some daintily embroidered
lingerie and samples of cross-stitch, found
many admirers, and a golf coat done in
cross-stitch with a pattern in colored silk
interwoven was much coveted. A show-case
of hand-made jewellery and trifles in beaten
silver included a set of teaspoons with pearls
from Broome inset upon the handles.
. Fairies with golden hair a-hanging down
their backs waved magic wands over Satur-
day night’s audience at His Majesty’s when
“lolanthe” held the stage. The fairies shared
the honors with the peers in their Court suits
of white satin, flowing cloaks of colored vel-
vet and jewelled coronets. Winifred Wil-
liamson was a dashing Fairy Queen, in white
and gold draperies Avith a jade-blue cape,
topped by a Valkyrie-like head-dress.
lolanthe (Effie Armstrong) wore white
draperies, and Patti Russell impersonated a
Watteau shepherdess, in blue and pink, with
wee posies. Conductor Slapoffski and pro-
ducer Minnie Everett covered themselves
with glory, the lady being generously remem-
bered when the botanical rewards were
handed up.
The new Governor’s wife, pictured here
by a Spencer Shier camera, cannot be re-
garded as entirely a stranger to Australia, for
her sister Viola
was here last
year with her
husband, Lord
Apsley, whose
exploits as an
immigrant
worker in the
Mallee district
were given so
much news-
paper atten-
tion. No doubt
tli e Apsleys’
favorable re-
ports helped to
induce the
Somerses t o
leave their an-
cestral home
i n Hereford-
shire and try
life in Mel-
bourne for five
years. Lady
Somers is slim, with very blue eyes, is fresh-
complexioned, and wears her fair hair
shingled. She is the youngest chatelaine
our State Government House has ever had,
though not the youngest vice-regal lady Vic-
toria has knov 1, since Lady Hopetoun was
but 22 when her husband became first
Governor-General of the Commonwealth.
Lady Somers, whose front name is Daisy,
is keen on tennis and golf and, of course,
loves huntin’. Her husband was M.F.H. in
Herefordshire for a time.
Austral Salonites jazzed beneath boughs
of peach and cherrv blossom illuminated by
pink lanterns at their monthly meet last
week. There were no parties, and partners
were changed as often as anyone could desire.
Mrs. J. L. Stein, who danced in black taf-
feta and filmy lace; Mrs. R. Fitclier, who
was in cosmos mauve ; Alice Richardson, in
draperies of gold mingled with blue; Gwen
Watt and Mrs. F. Beavis engineered the
affair, which will be repeated on the 28th.
Soprano songbird Madame Mary Conly, in
navy-blue with petunia-hued millinery, was
hostess at the Austral Salon’s latest tea-
party, aided by Mrs. E. L. Kiernan, a study
in cinnamon that harmonised with the
yellow chrysanthemums, jonquils and gum-
lips around her. Pupils of the singer, Aug-
usta Poole, Emilie Davies, John Hobbs and
Edward Beachcroft, were heard as well as
Madame herself, and Sadie Broughton’s
accompaniments pleased audience and singers
alike.
Carrie Haase’s recital at the Playhouse
last week was a well-staged affair that made
the efforts of the traditional declamatory elo-
cutionists seem like a bad dream. She ap-
peared first in a gown of burnt orange-hue,
trailed with gold, in a setting of Chinese
blue, with black furniture and brass bowls
of mellowed oak-leaves and marigolds.
Lawrence Housman’s “Brother Sun,” from
his “Little Plays of St. Francis of Assisi,”
was spoken in flowing twelfth-century raiment
of purple fabric and black velvet; a striped
silk head-dress was banded with gold. Old-
gold brocade and tall pointed millinery of
emerald green hue, with sparkling jewels
and a dangling white coif, like the queens on
the playing cards, added flavor to Eleanor
Farjeon’s “Rhymes of London Town.” There
was a large and delighted audience.
This is Captain Arthur Herbert Tenny-
son Cocks, M.C., D. 5.0., sixth Baron Somers,
who began to
be King’s
deputy in this
State last
wee k, an d
promises to
make a very
good job of it.
He was in the
Big Scrap
from the jump,
which puts
him right with
the Diggers,
and his merry
eye will en-
dear him to
the rest of
Victoria. And
there
is a suspicion
that he has a
sense of humor
—not a bad
thing for a
Governor to have, either; what a world of
trouble it would have saved poor Beauchamp
if he’d had half a hatful of it! Spencer Shier
pictures his Ex. iu full governing regalia.
A glowing fire lit up decorations of wattle
and autumn foliage, and imparted additional
glow to golden chrysanthemums and Iceland
poppies on the supper tables, when the V.T.A.
gave its dance at the Kooyong Tennis Club-
house. There was a fine show of beautiful
shawls ’tween dances. Esna Boyd was there,
in pervenche blue and ficelle lacc ; Dr. Esme
Anderson had glimmer of silver upon deep
cyclamen georgette, and Eileen Phippard
halted the eye in pink with bead embroidery.
St. Kilda Town Hall housed the dance
given by Newman College, whose colors—
cardinal, blue and black —formed the basis
of decorations that included red-sliaded lights
and hanging baskets of foliage. Justice
Cussen’s lady, in scintillating black, and col-
lege matron Miss Egan, also in black, were
hostesses. Lots of bonnie girls in their nicest
glad rags were there. Alice Cussen’s fair
locks were set off by almond-green covering,
and Claire Brennan was in taffeta of dark
cosmos tone.
Ethel Bradley, whose whispered “I will”
at Scots’ Church last week echoed the firm
accents of Norman Bennett, was the guest of
honor at a linen-tea given at the Wattle the
previous afternoon. The hostesses were Mrs.
P. Crisp and Mrs. E. Hotchken. There was
such a fine response from the guests that
the chest in the new home should overflow.
The last June bride of the year was
Ida V. Ferris of Brighton Beach, who ex-
changed vows with Lieut.-Colonel Ulrich,
The bridal gown of white georgette char-
mante was sewn with pearls and crjstals;
a veil of Limerick lace lined with silver
tissue and edged with ostrich-feather was
held in position with a circlet of orange-
blossoms, and was worn with pearl car pen-
dants. The bride drooped bashfully over a
sheaf of lilies. Two little maids, Joan
Aitkins (Adelaide) and Doris Ferris, wore
frilled frocks of peach-blossom pink geor-
gette, with Victorian bonnets and posies.
Mrs. W. Grey, matron of honor, shimmered
in a gold-lace tablier gown over rose satin,
gold tissue hat and rose carnations. Mr.
and Mrs. Ferris welcomed a big crowd at
No. 9 that night.
Dr. Brown, headmaster of Geelong
Grammar, did the locksmithing for one of his
old boys, Douglas White, son of the A. G.
Whites of Mount Duneed, at Trinity Col-
lege chapel last week. The bride, Violet
Fullerton, did medicine at the Uni., and is
a daughter of Dr. R. J. Fullerton of South
Melbourne. She faced the altar in a gown
of white and silver and a sheen of blue, with
a veil of rare Brussels lace, having Phyllis
Rymer, of Bendigo, as bridesmaid, in a frock
of cyclamen. The Lyceum Club accom-
modated the party afterwards.
The last English mail brought news of
Mrs. William Leonard, senior, who went to
the Big Smoke shortly after the death of
her husband, a popular figure in this State's
racing and pastoral world. She is reported
to be much improved in health and able to
renew many old friendships.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Bland, who have
been living in Miss Boldrewood Browne’s
house at Toorak for almost a year, have col-
lected their family and started for their
Sumatran home. Mrs. Bland, who is a Mel-
bourne girl, hadn’t been back for 10 years;
all the holidays had been spent in England
with the husband’s folk.
Alan Ellis Wood, member of a well-known
Toorak tribe, has extracted a promise true
from Gwyneth Campbell, of Brisbane.
The committee of the Geelong and Western
District’s winter carnival is rejoicing, for
their Exes, have promised to visit the town
where the tin Lizzies are screwed together
on July 15 to see the coursing and other
happenings.
Bridge and jazz at the Wattle on the
16th will help to make Alfred Hospital
bigger. All money received will be profit,
since Mrs. A. T. Ham not only hands over
her premises for the night, but makes the
tables groan as well. The promoters aim
at £5OO.
Mrs. Lort Smith, better known as Lulu
Montgomery, and her sister Marion, who
have for many a year taken on their shoul-
ders the hard work in connection with the
S.P.C.A. annual ball, have this year enlisted
so much sympathy that the sale of the
tickets is their only care. The hop comes off
at St. Kilda Town Hall on the 30th. The
love of animals was bred in the bone of
these two sports. Their father was a pioneer
of 1841, who settled near Sale, and they
were brought up among horses, dogs and
sheep.
A well-known Melbourne globe-trotter and
his wife, fed up with the way the baggage
smashers on the railways and wharves had
treated their belongings on previous occa-
sions, hit on the device of labelling their
luggage “With Care —China.” The ruse was
moderately successful. Nothing was broken,
but the stuff turned up in Hong Kong,
whereas the owners were going to Colombo.
Travaucore, the Flemington mansion of
29 rooms which the State Government has
acquired at £ll,OOO from Henry Madden as
a home for backward kiddies, was built when
Victoria was much younger by squatter Hugh
Glass, and is one of the show homes of
the metropolitan area. Henry Madden is the
sole survivor of the Madden brothers. John
was Chief Justice and Lieut.-Gov., Frank
Speaker for 13 years, and Walter Minister
for Lands in the history-making early
’eighties.
Melbourne Hospital has come in for an
unexpected shower of gold. Mrs. Martha
Mclntosh left four shops in Bourke-street,
and portion of the income has been paid to
the hospital under the terms of her will. The
last surviving life-tenant of the estate having
died, the whole lot goes to the hospital, which
benefits to the extent of nearly £50,000.
Sister Adelaide’s chronicles :
South Australians staying- with the Weigalls :it
Petwood, iu England, include the Walter Duncans,
the Dudley Turners and the Clem Hills. The men
of the families played in the Petwood XI against
Horncastle at the opening of the latter club’s new
ground. The one-time Governor is Lincolnshire’s
High Sheriff, and under his and Lady Weigall’s
hospitable wing that county is beginning to be one
of the best known to England-touring Adelaideans.
Waiford House romped home easy winners at the
girls’ school sports, to an accompaniment of shrill
feminine cheering and a tornado of waving flags and
ribbons. Mrs. Wallace Bruce was there to hand
shield and cup over to Nancy Fletcher, the Walford
House captain, and to say a word about the lass’s
own prowess as a hurdler. Most of our leading
girls’ schools are in the sports association, but one
or two still stand aloof, not yet convinced that strenu-
ous physical exercise is good for the young shc-
person.
Conservatorium students did very well in general
at their last concert in a mixed programme; but
Jean Baldwin and Marjorie Walsh were the out-
standing performers. The Conseryatoffj urn’s own
string quartette, by the way, is off tq> Melbourne for
a concert or two, taking Maude Pijiddy and Clive
Carey.
The Somerses, she in tones of brown and stone-
color with a bunch of violets tucked into her fur,
watched Tattersall’s meeting with Lady Bridges on
the day they were here. Vic.’s new Governor backed
at least one winner, and was the first; to congratulate
the owner who’d given him the tip.
From London comes news that SVrena and her
husband have anchored themselves in Milan for a
time to learn Italian. Plans ahead [include Berlin
and Vienna and another concert season in England;
so it may be a long time before they ssee the wattle
bloom again.
The Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society reports a
total of over £5OOO from its appeal—q record since
it began its excellent work. The scope 1 of relief is
to be extended, and, in special cases, giants will be
made for the benefit of children of T.B. men.

NOTIONS
Piratic having been withdrawn owing to a
doubtful jeg, there were 19 starters for the V.R.C.
Grand National Hurdle at Plemington on Saturday;
PiMin’s condition had been the theme of all sorts of
rumors; nevertheless, the topweight finished up a
firm favorite at 5. to 1, with Itoisel and Renown
at double that price, Heke, Joulni, Gunnedah and
Deacon at 12 to 1, Gulgo, Shanti and Olbrook at
16 to 1, and the others, for whom there were few
inquiries, from 20 to 100 to 1. Renown gave trouble
at the barrier and lost his chance there, though he
pursued the field for a time. Gunnedah took charge
soon after they had left the straight, and, jumping
brilliantly, was in front till about half a mile from
home, when Sparkling Moselle and Shanti cut him
down. The little-thought-of Western District mare
came round the home turn four lengths clear of Shanti
and Olbrook, with Scourie, Roisel and Deacon most
prominent of the others. Jumping the last hurdle
cleanly, Sparkling Moselle won in very easy fashion
by four lengths from Shanti, with Deacon, who made
up a tremendous lot of ground over the last six
furlongs,, three lengths away third, Roisel fourth and
Olbrook next; Pildin, last most of the way, beat five
horses home. Thirty-three to one was offered, with
few takers, about Sparkling Moselle, who showed fair
form in the Western District, but was recently beaten
in a brush steeple at Epsom. A six-year-old bay
by Bright Steel—Yorai, she is owned by N. Robinson
and trained by T. Waghorn, and was ridden by D.
Wraight. The time, smin. 4f>ifsec., was slow, but
the going was heavy, and after jumping the last
hurdle the mare was never at her top.
A 50-to-l shot in Klang (Demosthenes —Tolea) won
the Myross Handicap tor two-vear-olds, the race
preceding the National, and there was joy in the
tiibe of MoSbortodds. However, Jupiter (4 to 1)
relieved it of some of its winnings after an exciting
finish with Namera (9 to 2) in the Kensington
Steeple; and the good work was continued by March
(4 to l) in the lramoo Welter and Three Kings (a
to 1) in the Winter Handicap. Three Kings had
been very unlucky in previous races, but he made no
mistake on this occasion, smothering Andy and Parr
with a fine run. He is. a four-year-old gelding by
Comedy King—Kuningada.
It is a novelty to find three Xvdnev horses most
prominent in the betting on the G.'N. Steeple, but at
the moment of writing, such is the case with Clan
Robert (list. 81b.), Jupiter (list. 41b.) and Pericles
(9st. 131 b.). All three have unquestionable chances,
as also have Agricolo (list. 61b.) and Blankwyn
(lOst. 21b.). Clan Robert Looks the best of the
bunch, but many Sydney people will have a wager
each way on the hardy Jupiter, who nearly always
gets into the money.

“Hasen”: It was the morning of Lord
Somers’s arrival in Melbourne. Bill was brooding’
heavily over his beer and other things. In his
eve was a far-away look. Vice-royalty, even royalty
itself, held little interest for Bill, but he could not
nelp hearing with half an ear the words of the two
who had just entered the bar. They were discussing
the reception. “No wonder,” said one, “the Governor
looked dead beat. The excitement, you know, and
the crowds. What a fuss they make over these
things!” “Yes,” said the other, “it was too much.”
And then, “What a racket the guns made!” There
was a howl —from Bill, emerging from the alcoholic
mists. “’Struth 1” he veiled. “Dead, is ’e? The
Gov’nor dead ! Talk about luck ! I ’ad that ruddy
orse doubled with nearly everything in the Steeple!”

‘‘Ascot": The Queensland Turf Club is
celebrating the most successful year in its history.
Receipts were £125,262 ; members contributed
£2893, and bookmakers, owners, caterers and the
general public put in' the rest. Tote profits were
£47,846, of which ’£19,621 went to the State
Government; the Government also collared all the
n actions, amounting to £6904. Club members kick
at the latter exaction and say the fractions should go
to charity, as they do in Adelaide. Prize money
totalled £69,893, an increase of £4536, and the
year closed with a net profit of £13,665. The club
has been converted to the view that big stakes bring
mg receipts, so there will be an all-round increase
next season.
“Ascot" : Lily veil horses are fairly plenti-
hil in Queensland, but hitherto they have not dis-
tinguished themselves, most of them figuring in
the lower divisions at Breakfast Creek or with the
Ponies at Kedron. No Step, who has won distance
Dices at Ascot, was accounted the best of the breed
s o far as Queensland was concerned, but it now
appears that Lily-veil has a worthier son in Lilylaml.
this four-year-old gelding, lately graduated from the
second division, has won two Plates in succession

Play be a possibility for one of the big races at
‘he Exhibition meetings in August.:
More ton”: “A racehorse for a bob is
becoming a familiar cry in Queensland. Polyanthus
and Golden Ringer were raffled for the benefit of a
Toowoomba institution; then an anonymous philan-
thropist bought Wee Glen and presented him to Mrs.
K. G. Theodore as first prize in a lottery tp raise funds
for hospitals. Wee Glen was best two-
year-old, and as an early three-year-old he won the
State Derby and Cup. He” fared poorly in the autumn,
possibly owing to over-racing, but he will very likely
come good again. He will be a cheap horse for a
bob, anyway.
“Hotliam” : If English racecourses are not
as well appointed as Australian, at least the sport
seems to contain greater variety for followers of the
game. A gentleman with an Italian name has been
taxed in a London Court with having made £30,000
a year as head of a gang which blackmailed book-
makers and ran the rule over punters. Ikey, it seems,
was charged a fee of from £5 to £5O a day for a
“pitch”-—this without reference to the owners of the
course or to the clubs conducting the racing. Tic
also had to pay fancy prices for race-cards published
by the gang. Failure to comply ensured the rushing
of the betting stands by his “patrons,” confiscation
of bags and books, ana a plentiful supply of the
boot. Alas, there is no such spice in the wine of
facing existence in Australia!
“Wigs”: Tullius, originally the property
of T. M. Burke, has been leased by Holt, the
Mordialloc trainer, to Leon Gordon, the leading
mummer and author of “White Cargo,” whose
ambition, as per the publicity agent, is to -win a
Melbourne Cup. Gordon proposes to reehristen his
acquisition, giving him the name- of the play which
lias made good money
for him. He has also
purchased a greyhound,
The Native, which he
has nominated for the
Vic. Waterloo Cup ; the
hound was runner-up
for the Adelaide Derby.

Vi' Tenano Pol key was last in Aus-
tralia, Havilah Uren settled him twice, in seven and
nine rounds respectively. On the strength of a
dubious defeat of Paul Demsky, who was suffering
from dengue fever, the Filipino was reimported, and
Iren was again selected as his opponent. The
inevitable consequences were a slim attendance at
the Sydney Stadium and a third victory for the
Australian. Havilah did not knock Tenario out this
trip, but did everything- else allowable under M.Q.
rules, and got a well-earned verdict at the close
of the twentieth. Pelkey used the kidnev-punch,
held with one hand and hit with the other, and other-
wise offended. On a couple of occasions he seemed
to have Uren worried by his fierce attacks; but

American .Toe Hall's argument with Bert
McCarthy at .Melbourne Stadium kept the small crowd
mildly interested throughout. Mao’s nose seemed to
be an irresistible magnet for the coon’s long- left.
He tried hard to get past the persistent member and
make it a close-quarters mill, and when he succeeded
he notched the points; but Hall entered upon the
second stage of the journey with a handy margin.
In round 13 Mac was “out on his. feet,” but the
visitor’s efforts to land a finisher were crude. How-
ever, his wallops gradually slowed Bert down to a
walk, and when the white was on the floor in the
18th, the result of a powerful right, Quiik immedi-
ately crowned the colored gemmum. Each weighed

The Germans sent a “hot” team to Britain
for the amateur championships at Stamford Bridge
—-they hadn’t been represented there for a decade —
and will obviously have to be reckoned with in the
J 928 Olympic contests at Amsterdam. Their sprinters
dominated the 100 yards, which went to one .Oorts
in even time; and Peltzer, a young doctor from
Stettin, made a great impression by beating. Lowe,
of Olympic celebrity, in the half-mile and running-
second to Rinkel, a classy Briton, in the quartet-mile.
In the former event he established the world’s .record
t ime of lmin. 51 3-ssec. ; Lowe, who was three
yards behind, also cut a fraction off the. previous
record, lmin. 52£sec. Maoriland’s-, Randolph Rose
has failed to strike form in England, aneb thoucT
he led for half the journey in the final of the mil;
(having qualified by running third in his heat), lit
was beaten out of a place, Baraton, the Frenchman,
winning in 4min. 17 4-ssec. Dr. Porritt, also of
Maonlarid, was third in the 220 yards to Butler
(Britain) and Bucher (Germany) in 21 O-'lOsec
Australia had a worthy representative in Dr. Homier
formerly of Sydney Uni., who won the -long jump
with a leap of 23ft. Bin. Britain collected most of
the points, Webster, its 10-mile champion, performing
the Nurmi-like feat of capturing a 2-mile steeple
(in lOmin. 34 l-ssec.) and a 4-mile flat race (in
Ifimin. 49 3-ssec.) on the same afternoon.
“C.Q.” : We have the American ball name,
but there are still forms of sport known to Uncle Sam
which await acclimatisation. I quote from the lead-
ing- newspaper of Des Moines, lowa:
“The champion long-range gum-spitter of Des
Moines is to be crowned here. The Junior Chamber
of Commerce will have its annual smoker and the
gum-spitting contest will be one of the principal
events. Each contestant will be given a nickel’s
worth of gum, and the one able to shoot the wad
the furthest will be crowned champion.”
The “crown,” I suppose, was a spittoon. If it
wasn’t, it, ought to have been.
If .Suzanne Lenglen hadn’t been obliged to
withdraw, the French would probably have been as
successful at Wimbledon this year as they were in
1925. As it was they captured the singles with
Borotra, who defeated the American Howard Kinsey
in straight sets, and the doubles with Cochet and
Brugnon, who decisively accounted for Kinsey and
Richards. Obviously the French are going to be
verv formidable opponents for the Yanks in the
Davis Cup matches. Mrs. Godfree (Kitty McKane
that was) went home laden with trophies ; she beat
the D’Alvarez girl, of Spain, in the final of the ladies’
sipgles, helped her husband to conquer Kinsey and
Miss Browne in the mixed doubles, and, with Miss
Colyer as a partner, lifted second prize in the ladies’
doubles—the Misses Ryan and Browne were first.
Carr closed England’s innings in the
second Test when three wickets had fallen for 475
(Hobbs 119, Sutcliffe 82, Woolley 87, Hendren 127
n. 0., Chapman 50 u. 0.). Australia started her second
venture 92 behind and had lost five wickets for 194
when the match ended in a draw. Macartney (133
"■Op "’as the good angel of the side this time;
Collins helped materially by stonewalling over three
hours for 24. But for the two great displays of
hatting by the two veterans of the team, and for
Oldfield’s admittedly superb wicketkeeping, there
was scant comfort for this country in the scores.
Only these two established and maintained a mastery
over the English bowling, whereas every Englishman
who batted-made our attack look the poorest that has
been seen in a Test for many a year. On one side
three wickets fell for 476 and on the other 15 for
oil. If the result was indefinite de jure, it was
conclusive enough de facto.
The fact that the match was left drawn, however,
lias naturally revived the clamor for the removal of
the time limit in international contests, or. failing
that, for six days’ play or even four. On this
occasion, which is perhaps also natural, it is English
critics and writers who are most convinced of the
necessity for the reform, but they don’t make out
much of a case. Aggravating as drawn games may
be to people who insist on haling results, long-
drawn-out struggles might be more aggravating still
to those who set the quality of the cricket "above
the result. Experience has shown that even in Aus-
tralia six days’ full play, of the type that is getting
all too common in Sheffield Shield matches, is not
always sufficient to finish a game. And surely if
there is one thing.that sticks out about this second
I est it is that three days might easily have been enough
to finish it —even on a wicket that gave the bowlers
no assistance—if the side that established an
advantage on the sec ond day had pressed it by■ forcing
cricket. The Englishmen, it might be said, deserved
to win on the figures and were rightly served in
that they didn’t win because of their tactics. Hobbs,
pottering about for an hour between 90 and 100,
vvasn t playing for his side—he was playing for
himself and another century in Tests, Collins,
sitting on the splice half the afternoon for 24, really
rendered much more meritorious service; he was
averting defeat, while Hobbs, at this stage of his
innings, was merely lessening the chance of victory.
Had he forced the game, or got out in the attempt
and made way for a faster scorer ofi tired bowling,
the result might easily have been different. Chap-
man, one of the quickest of run-getters normally,
never showed himself less enterprising and Carr, a
natural hitter, didn’t even bat. The fetish of
averages and statistics probably did more to save
Australia than the three days’ limit.
The tourists are having a rough spin in the matter
of sickness and injury. Collins is laid up with
neuritis, Hendry is not yet recovered, Gregory looks
liable to break down at any moment, and Ryder is
now in the doctor’s hands. But they found no difficulty
in extinguishing Northampton bv an innings and
147 runs. Australia batted first; Bardslev (112),
Ryder (84), Macartney (42), Grimmett (36 n. 0.) were
the most prolific contributors to the total of 397.
The partnership of Bardsley and Ryder put. on 155
.for the fifth wicket. The county was locked cut
for a mere 125 at each attempt, Hawtin (29 and
34) being the best performer. Mailey took 10
wickets. for 87 in the two innings, and Grimmett
7 for 68.
Notts looked a tougher nut to crack, but Mail-v
again proved invaluable. The county batted first
and that so poorly that eight wickets were down for
87. Flint (87 n. 0.) came to the rescue; the last
two men, Barratt and Richmond, stayed with him until
the total had reached 192. Mailey at one stage had
5 for 13, but his seven wickets were to cost 110.
Bardsley took Richardson with him for opening
partner, but it was Macartney (81) who helped his
C. V. MORRISSEY, Randwick centre-three-
quarter, a hope of the N.S.W. side to
meet the All Blacks.
captain to put the side on velvet. Andrews and
Woodful! were two other batsmen to return to form
the former with a stylish 91 and the latter, who began
cautiously but . gathered confidence in the later stages
with a fine 102 n.o. The total reached 468. Bardslev
went near to registering his fourth successive eenturv
but Larwood . dismissed him on Monday moraine
before he had added to his Saturdav’s score, 87. The
fast bowler took 3 wickets for *BB and th» slow
(Richmond) 3 for 132. Notts began their second
innings in a minority of 275 and were in a hopeless
position at, the close of Monday’s play, with 6
wickets .(Mo)ley got five of them) down for 94.
“Centurion” : Critics arc notoriously cantankerous
but the individuals who blither about cricket in
daily papers are in a class by themselves. When
C.hapnmn was selected to play for England in the
n ' ~ lest, one of these experts deprecated the
cftoiOe. Promising as he was, the young fellow had
a serious weakness, this being his tendency to have
a go at everything. Though warned that he would
have to steady his style if he wished to become really
great, Chappy” was told that the Australians knew
Pls failings, and were bound to get him, whatever
he did. The youth must have taken the advice, for
his contribution in the second Test was 50 n. 0.,
made in correct and,- for him, stolid fashion. Yet the
chap whose advice had been taken was the maddest
critic of them all, and his language about Chapman’s
careful and unenterprising play nearly set fire to
the cable.
“Ex-Englishman”: Really the most likely way to
win outright any three-days’ match —granted that
the wicket is good and one side not overwhelmingly
stronger than the other—is to lose the toss. Say, the
other side makes 240 and is out by tea-time, you
making 320 by tea-time next. day. On the third
day another 240 puts them only' 160 ahead; and
some time in the afternoon you go in with only
that to make, and knowing exactly how long there
I ? a^ le it ih. But take the very same figures
it you bat first. You make your 320 on the first day,
and they their 240 by tea-time on tiie second. By
lunch-time on the third you have a long lead ; vou
feel sure you won’t need it, but dare not leave
them too little to make in the time, and so go on
piling up unnecessary runs. At last you declare,
and they, with no chance of winning, play for a
draw and very likely get it. This calculation is
correct enough ; but, as someone has lately said, the
desire to make sure of not losing is stronger
nowadays than the desire to win outright, and "no
test-match captain is at all likely to send his
opponents in, on anything like a decent wicket. But
the weaker counties might always be courteously
directed by Collins to bat first; otherwise it almost
inevitably needs a follow-on to produce any definite
result.
Pipards” : Parker, the Gloucestershire bowler who
performed creditably against the Australians for the
.South of England at Bristol and may displace Root
for the third Test, lias had no superior in county
cncket as a wicket-taker during the past five years,
albeit he is now over 40. His bag has been 902
wickets at a cost of a little over 15 runs apiece.
The analysis has been bettered by Rhodes, Macaulay,
iviJner and Tate in the same period, but the tally of
wickets has only once been exceeded for a five-year
period, and that was nearly 30 years ami. Tom
Richardson took 912 wickets between ’94 and ’9B.

THE INKY WAY.
The Lithgow (N.S.W.) Mercury, which
won distinction in its day as a doughty Radi-
cal, has been bought by the Bathurst
Times —the consolidation of provincial news-
paper interests is strongly in evidence just
now. John Farrell used to be owner and
editor, and when he took his bright pen to
Sydney D.T. he passed the Mercury over
to James Ryan, the present M.L.C., who has
run it for 35 years. The company control-
ling the Bathurst Times now becomes
Western Newspapers, Ltd., and there are
whispers of other annexations.
“Rose Park”: It is open to question
whether the action of the Adelaide dailies
in posting the latest cricket scores outside
their offices in the morning (B. 10/6/’2GV
doesn’t help rather than hinder the sales of
the News, Adelaide’s only evening, paper.
The bare scores whet the reader’s appetite
for the full description of the game in the
afternoon paper. During the last series
of Tests played here, the Adelaide dailies
had miniature scoring-boards in front of
their premises, and scores were posted every
half-hour: it certainly didn’t affect their own
sales next morning.
Sydney News man O'Carroll, who is that
paper's “Man About Tewn,-’ received a
special , copy of the issm- with which the
Brisbane ( ’ourier celebrat'd its SOtli anni-
versary. O’Carroll spoor his journalistic
infancy on the paper where his father toiled
and his grandfather occupied the editorial
chair. There are not many newspapers in
Australia with which three generations of
one family have been connected—only one
probably which has run to four generations.
There is a son of newly-knighted .T. O. Fair-
fax on the S. M. Herald: and J.O. is the
original Mister John’s grandson.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: The Manly Daily,
which has become a very solid property, has
started a subsidiary music-publishing co.
which deserves a word. To put its products
on the market it has established a shop in
King-street, Sydney, the windows of which
are given over to displays of songs by Aus-
tralians. The ditties are mostly of the jazz
variety, but if we must have that sort of
music it is better that it should be Aus-
tralian than imported. Perhaps the new
venture will rise to higher things later on.
The paper itself came out of a very dry and
unpromising cocoon. A comp, named Lin-
coln, who had run various country rags, left:
his sub-editor’s job on the Broken Hill
Miner, after a very hot summer, to get back
to the surf. And to make the surf give him
bread-and-butter he persuaded Edwards.
Dunlop to help him start a tiny free daily
at the ocean-side.
“You Yangs”: Just about the time
the Melbourne Argus was moving into its
new building, strong in the consciousness of
a long life of rectitude, the library committee
of the Federal Parliament was issuing
volume 20 of the “Historical Records of
Australia.” Here may be found, amongst
other things, confidential reports from Gov-
ernors to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies on the newspapers of Sydney and
Melbourne as they existed in IS4B. This is
what Latrobe had to say about the Argus
of that day :
The Melbourne Argus dates from 1846 and is
published twice a week; its circulation may be
about 400 copies, chiefly in town, amongst the
Presbyterian and Orange parties. The violent uid
disgraceful party spirit that has sprung up in
Melbourne, though it may not have originated with
the editor of this paper, has nevertheless been
mainly kept alive by las publications; and the
general tone of the Argus under his management
is quite as discreditable as that which distinguished
the Patriot newspaper formerly, when under his
control. The Argus violently deprecates the intro-
duction of prison labor in any form.
Of the Sydney. Morning Herald Governor
Fitzroy remarks that its circulation was
about 3000. “Its leading articles,” lie writes,
“do not appear to be governed by any fixed
rules or principles.” From which two
opinions it may be guessed that there wasn't
such a thing as a knight or even an 0.8. E.
on the premises of the Herald and the Argus
in those days.
“P.X.” : It isn’t much of a compliment to
the Australian press that every Australian
newspaper man who is adorned with a title
gets it allegedly for something apart from
his paper's services to the country. Lang-
don Bonython, one of the first of them, got
his, so it was said, because of his great in-
terest in and gifts for education, and so did
Hackett, the Westralian. Sowdeii, of the
B.A. Register, was Swilliamed because of
his work for the Public Library and Art
Gallery, and “Mr. James,” of the S. M.
Herald, was accused of sufficient philan-
thropy and Y.M.C.A. work to be worth a
knighthood. Sulman, at the time chairman
of the Telegraph, had to get something to
balance the insult offered to the Herald ;
so his town-planning enthusiasm was resur-
rected. And now ,T. O. Fairfax doesn’t get
his poor and insufficient little 1v.8.E. as the
representative of a paper that Sydney can
he proud of, but because he pottered around
for some years with Red Cross work. Isn’t
it about time the silly pretence was ended?
Frank Fox, a K.B. in the new list of
birthday tags, has travelled a good way since
he was “the boy editor” of Sydney Work-
man, the forerunner of the Worker. Later
he was on the Telegraph, for which, as
Frank lienar, he, with Ambrose Pratt, wrote
one or two serial shockers. J. F. Archibald
was attracted by his forcible style and his
large capacity for making himself agreeable
at the A then mum Club, and invited him on
to the staff of The Bulletin, from which
he was transferred to the Lone Hand when
that magazine was started. But the Lone
Hand was before its time; so Fox put on
liis bat and made for London, where lie soon
found a place on the Morning Post. Ho
did various jobs in the Great War, has writ-
ten a dozen books—those on Empire pro :
blems probably Avon him his title —and re-
mains as forceful as ever, and as fluent. He
was born in Adelaide, is still only 52, and
his Avife is the daughter of Clint, the old
fjeenic artist. His one son came to Aus-
tralia two or three years ago to grow things
in Queensland.

FROM the West, the Marlborough White
Horse cut out in 1804 can be seen
on the slope of the hill to the right of
the High Road.
Like most of the other Wessex White Horses,
the White Horse of Marlborough is emblematic
of victory or of some noteworthy event. Its
care and preservation have been the proud
charge of each succeeding generation.
The cc White Horse ” tradition is shared also by
that White Horse which has symbolised Scotland’s
finest Whisky since 1746. From generation to
generation the Distillers have maintained the
excellence and great age of WHITE HORSE
Whisky, which has won for it the approval of
connoisseurs all over the world.

Long before the curtain fell on the last
act of “The Climax,” Dot Brunton had laid
to rest all doubts as to whether she could
repeat in a heavier metier the success she
had won in musical comedy. There Was
never any doubt about her ability to give full
measure in the lighter sides of a part mak-
ing a larger demand than most; it was when
the shadow of overmastering tragedy struck
suddenly into the comedy that Dot Brunton
surprised and gripped her audience. Not
once did she rant in the effort to display
the heart-break of the singingrgirl smitten
with the tragedy of a lost voice; lint with
quiet emotion she —and Guy Bates Post with
her —thrilled the audience into a strained
silence. It needs good acting to make a suc-
cess of this play by Edward J. Locke—not,
by the way, the Englishman who has writ-
ten many readable books, but an American
dramatist who wrote in days before the
movies had spread their maleficent influence.
The play is familiar to only a few Sydney-
ites who can remember the tender little
story when it was produced with Florence .
Young, J. B. Atholwood, Dion Titheradge
and Reg Roberts playing the parts. Flo
Young, with all her versatility, was only a
moderate success in it; the part better fits
Dot Brunton, though it does not follow that
she would be able to make success in a part
entirely dramatic.
* * * *
The story starts the day in orthodox
fashion with breakfast. Adelina Von Hagen
lives in the poor lodgings of Luigi Golfanti,
an impecunious singing-master who is satis-
fied that her voice means a career if' some
slight defect in the mechanism is corrected.
He is not really her uncle, but a connection,
yet she fits in easily enough in the capacity
of adopted niece and housekeeper, and she
is subjected to the calf-love pf the music-
teacher’s son Pietro and the steady pursuit
of the young doctor’, John Raymond, who is
vehemently opposed to her projected stage
career. Although assured that in only one
case in a thousand is there any danger in
the operation to which she submits —the
operation leads to quaint stage situations in
which Dot Brunton, though always in the
action, does not speak a word through half
an act —Adelina loses her voice, and despair
brings her close to suicide; but, really
caring for him, she tries to forget, and be-
comes engaged to marry Raymond. The dis-
covery that he has tricked her, practising
mental suggestion so that she will marry
him, comes with the accidental discovery
that she still possesses the voice cleared of
its old defect; but even in her dismissal of
the repentant lover, with her own sorrow
outweighed by the ecstasy of reawakened
ambition, there is a suggestion of forgive-
ness. Guy Bates Post has not been seen
in anything better than the lovable old sen-
timental Bohemian, Luigi Golfanti, whose
every grunt he made effective; Dennis Car-
dan. a newcomer, was likeable as the vol-
canic youth Pietro, who expresses bis emo-
tions on the piano; and Gerald Pring sup-
plied his share of the good acting which the
play must have.
For sheer sensuous delight the art of Wil-
liam Backhaus has not been excelled by any
pianist who has come to Sydney in this
decade, at any rate. Music under his fingers
is woven into an atmosphere of warmth and
color, ethereal yet passionate, that beats
and surges upon the emotions. The frenzy
of applause that greeted the final of
Beethoven’s Sonata Appassionata at the
Town Hall on Saturday night was as much
the relief of these surcharged feelings as the
intellectual understanding of a great com-
position. The grandeur, the majestic tone
of the last allegro of that tremendous out-
burst are beyond words. Next came a group
that started with Schumann’s “In the Even-
ing,” as delicate as wistaria under the moon.
This was followed by three short composi-
tions of the Fantasy pieces from the spon-
taneous pen of the tenderest writer of them
all. Then came an arrangement of the
scherzo from Mendelssohn’s “Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” by Australian Ernest
Hutcheson, and this was a bit of the pro-
gramme that should put a prouder hop into
the kangaroo’s tail. The Brahms variations
on a theme by Paganini were a still further
manifestation by Backhaus of his powers.
From the crash and scintillation of these
amazingly difficult variations the pianist
passed to a Chopin group that included the
beloved Polonaise in A Flat. Schumann,
Liszt and Rachmaninoff were the composers
offered as encores. There are old music-
lovers who treasure memories of Paderewski.
They will find in Backhaus one who will
revive those memories as no other player
known to this Page could.
sjs
“Quality Street” is to be introduced to the
Sydney Royal on Saturday week (17th) by
the Boucicault company ; so “The Silver
King” says farewell on the Friday—a fare-
well which will be. also Frank Harvey’s good-
bye to Australia. Except at the Grand
Opera House no changes are projected else-
where. There Fanny Benstead is making
an appearance in “Our Liz” in some inter-
polated numbers. After the break-up of the
Lee White co. in Melbourne.she was engaged
for lead in this piece, but her illness put the
part into the hands of Hilda Attenboro, who
has done too well to be disturbed. “Rose
Marie,” at, Her Majesty’®), and “No, No,
Nanette,” at the St. James, continue to prove
gold-mines to their manng'e'monts • and “The
Last of Mrs. Cheyney” at the Criterion is a
long, long last-
* *
To the Players’ Club belongs the honor of
introducing Ashley Duke’s “Man with a
Load of Mischief” to Sydney. A play of
sentiment and philosophy, it came as pleas-
ing to the mind as a freshly-gathered straw-
berry to the lips. Played in one setting and
with little action, its six characters have to
depend for their effects outside the quality
of the characters themselves on the flexibility
of their voices and the mobility of their
features. Full of “atmosphere,” the play
is woven in an exquisite pattern of language.
The full savor of this was conveyed by Eric
Howell, the gentleman’s gentleman who turns
out to he the real nobleman of the piece, and
by Kathleen Robinson, whose lady was a
creation of charming gesture and shaded in-
tonations. Geoffrey Rex was incapable of
expressing - the polished deviltry of the noble-
man, and though this was deplorable in the
character it is praiseworthy in the young-
man. Eric Howell produced the play, and
he can do such things very well,

The marriage of Decima has not caused a
divorce in the dancing partnership of the
McLeans, who were the Little Dartos when
they were infants and have travelled on their
toes all round the world. Sydney Tivoli has
captured the agile Eddie and his sister, with
results that are producing cascades of
applause at the Sydney Tivoli. Decima’s
husband, Eric Masters, provides some vocal,
and hi&trionic. background for a vigorous
“Apache” dancing scena. And Frankie Heath
goes on her amusing way.
"THE LAST OF
MRS. CHEYNEY,”
AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Renee Kelly as Mrs. Cheyney, and Hylton
Allen as Charles, the “crook” butler.
Vaudeville memories seem to last longest,
and Joe Brennan, with Ida Newton to help
him in well-arranged character sketches,
found a warm greeting on his return to
Fullers’ Theatre (Sydney). Another Ida,
whose back name is Halbein, did some
crisp work with a piano and a good-
humored voice. The idiocy of Claude Dam-
pier continues to raise loud guffaws; and Jim
Gerald, whose season has run to 23 weeks,
got the usual laughs for the usual hotchpotch.
Sydney art students have a show:—
No special precocity is noticeable amongst the work
of the prize winners among Royal Art Society students
exhibited at the Pitt-street rooms. The work of
P. J. Norton is the most outstanding; but though
he won the prize in the still-life section, it was with
a rather wooden contribution. The composition is,
however, fairly good, as it is in a portrait lacking in
proportion with which he scored also the first place in
that division. Miss I. Mackenzie and Mr. Latty share
the landscape prize. Alcasie G. Kane must have run
them close. There is some fine work in this section;
and a charcoal drawing by Lindsay Doyle also shows
promise.
“WHITE CARGO,” AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Helen Stransky as Tondeleyo, the dusky
vamp j Austin Coghlan as Langford, who
marries her; Wallis Clark as the doctor,
who absorbs whisky and exudes philo-
sophy.
If there have been deficiencies in the
present G. and S. season at Melbourne
Majesty’s, they were forgotten by the audi-
ence which inspected “lolanthe” on Satur-
day night; and if there was one display
better than another it was Charles Walenn’s
matrimonial attachment to the part of the
Lord Chancellor. If one may guess at that
whimsical comedian’s ancestry, he was con-
ceived by John Tenniel out of an after-
dinner conversation with Lewis Carroll. No
other parents could have placed the old-
ivory head of a senile Oriental idol on a
leprechaun’s nimble body—a body which its
owner cloaks in gold-encrusted robes and a
dottering gait until the moment comes which
he considers opportune for a display of
graceful and giddy youthfulness. Gilbert
must have had his eye on Walenn when he
wrote the part of the noble lord who weds
a fairy and becomes the father of a son,
immortal from head to waist, and human
from the waist down to the corns.
* * * «
Strella Wilson was absent from the choir,
but Lance Fairfax was a richly melodious
Strephon and James Hay a harmonious
Earl Tolloller. Patti Russell invested the
part of Phyllis with bodily grace, though
she could have been more often on the note;
and Effie Armstrong, obviously suffering
from 25 years’ immersion in her pond, only
pushed herself through the part of lolanthe.
The chorus of peers was rich of voice and
garb, and the fairy crowd, in high-heeled
shoes from an Australian last, clattered
cheerfully through their job. The present
exhibit may be described as a bon mot which
begins with the overture and remains up-
lifted till the final curtain, and, surveying
it. one wonders why the British people,
with this tradition behind them, ever turned
their attention to the splutterings of Ameri-
can librettists.

Helton Daniel! essayed Leonid Andreyev’s
“He Who Gets Slapped” at Melbourne
Playhouse on Saturday, and partially dis-
pelled this Page’s suspicions that the reper-
tory movement is being subsidised by the
commercial theatre-owners for the discour-
agement of highbrow drama. The rendering,
despite numerous faults, was infinitely sup-
erior to the moving-picture version which has
lately been screened in Melbourne. The
dramatic interest depends entirely for trans-
port upon exciting incidents that happen in
a circus, the effect of which are seen in the
mental reactions of the characters that
tramp in and out of the dressing-room on
their way to and from the lion’s cage or
the flaming hoop. Hence the delicate nuances
of attitude and intonation are of importance.
Some of these nuances successfully navi-
gated the footlights and some stumbled by
the wayside. The person who gets slapped
is a literary gent who leaves his wife and
the creations of his brain to another man
and seeks peace of soul as Dummy in a
circus ring. The producer took the part and
made his gestures plausible enough, but a
monotony of diction suggested physical
pain rather than psychic emotion. Ray
Whiting more or less concealed his sanguine
youth behind the dark moustache of a cyni-
cal count who raises money from the man-
agement on the pretence that the circus
queen is his daughter. Isabel Handley, as
the queen, just lacked the vital flame which
would have made justifiable homicides of
the various murders and suicides surround-
ing her doleful course. Ruby May added
another admirable picture to her large gal-
lery of emotional portraits. She was the lion-
tamer, whom all men fear and on whom
only a lion is found to bestow the kiss of
genuine affection. The rest of the army
marched and counter-marched with varying
efficiency.

As “Abie’s Irish Rose,” due to supplant
“Betty Lee” at the Princess on Saturday,
approaches on its all-American shoe-leather,
Melbourne is being daily stunned by a fresh
statistical barrage. The cast has played the
thing more’n a thousand times and 25 million
people have surveyed it. The bud, apparently,
is one not to be sniffed at. “Leave It to
Jane” is in its last eight nights at the Royal,
where “Tell Me More,” a musical play, is
impending. George Gee, Gus Bluett, Cecil
Kellaway, Leyland Hodgson and Hugh
Steyne will contend for the honor of giving
voice its best humors. “White Cargo,”
at the King’s, has survived a visit from two
of Commissioner Blarney’s most virtuous
policemen, who heard nothing they had never
heard before. “The Best People” continue
to be at home at the Athenaeum ; but Frank
Neil, at the Palace, w 7 ill be asked to make
room for Chefalo, magician, and Irving’s
Imperial Midgets, on Saturday.

Elocutionists of the late-Victorian school
will find little to interest them in Carrie
Haase’s recitals of modern verse at Mel-
bourne Playhouse. A carefully modulated
voice, a water-colorist’s attention to atmo-
sphere, and a fine appreciation of her author’s
literary intentions are the lady’s recipe for
serving up John Masefield, A. E. Ilousman,
Rupert Brooke, Sassoon and others. A
panel of W. J. Turner’s works is an inter-
esting part of her repertoire. Turner is an
Australian poet apparently better known
abroad than in liis native land.

Melbourne took far too long to discover
the charms of the talented ladies calling
themselves the Kendall String Quartet, and
attendances at the Assembly Hall weren’t
as large as the merits of the display deserved.
Perfect taste and rhythmical unity are the
hallmarks of the squad.

Among first appearancers at Melbourne
Tivoli are Baggett and Sheldon, who, con-
sidering present prices, show unforgivable
disrespect to hats; and Barclay and liis
friend are acceptable comedians. Niobe re-
tires nightly under water, which one hopes
is at a higher temperature than the morning
shower is reported to be these days; and
Van Dock, the high-speed artist, draws in
more senses than one. Gautier and his doggy
entourage have likewise returned.

A rather saddening feature of the Bijou’s
current Melbourne feast is the lady who
climbs on to a pedestal and lets the gent, who
works the magic-lantern throw gaudy pic-
tures at her. Speculation as to whether the
portrait of King George will hit the lady
in the eye or rest its head contentedly on
her diaphragm is the only thrill the turn
provides. Millie Doris provides good char-
acter sketches, and Oscar Beck has a very
pleasing tenor.
*❖ * *
Rin-tin-tin, the talented hound, is again
making his silent bow-wow to Melbourne
picture patrons at the Majestic, in “Below
the Line,” a good example of movie art, in
which the animal mummers are superior to
the human. In “Satan’s Sister,” the West
Indies provides a blackcloth to an exciting
yarn by Stacpoole. A British novelist is
also being patronised at Hoyt’s, where Con-
rad’s “Lord Jim” is dodging the conse-
quences of his solitary lapse. A story is
bound to lose when the longest monologue
in literature is cut down to half a dozen
sub-titles, but some of the magic of Malaya
and the dramatic framework of the narrative
have Survived.
* '-!= $ t-
“Quality Street,’ at Adelaide Royal,
proves to wear wonderfully well, and prob-
ably this is due to the good acting. Angela
Baddeley revels in all of the four different
characters that Phoebe practically is, and
Brian Ahearne is masterly as the domineer-
ing male. But perhaps the heart of audi-
ences goes out especially to Mary Jcrrold,
a fountain of quiet fun, as effective when
silent as when speaking. “The White
Sister” picture carries on indefinitely at
Wonder graph. It is half as long again as
it need be, and is unrelieved gloom.
West’s is intense with “Souls for Sables”
and comic with “A Regular Fellow”; the
York features Lionel Barrymore, but the
quiet Lewis 'Stone is more satisfactory.

The flajoi'
Poverty
Point
“Minim”: Tail enough to tower over
every member of an average audience, Chali-
apin has bulk to match and feet so large
that his boots must always be made speci-
ally for him. He has mastered a few Eng-
lish phrases, but sings either in Russian or
in French with a Slav accent. His Austra-
lian audiences will have to buy a “book of
words” containing a libretto of his reper-
toire, as it were, and Chaliapin will put
them on the right track by reciting his form-
ula : “Ay weel now seeng noombair sayventy-
scex,” or whatever it is. Though big and
getting on in years—he confesses to 53
he is nervous. One thing he can’t stand is
a surge of the audience towards the stage,
such as sometimes happens for the last
encore number. In such a case he’s apt to
gallop to the nearest exit.
NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT MODELS.
THE ARTIST ( proudly ): “You know, I have
one of my pictures hung in one of our
publie institutions.”
THE MODEL : “Oh, I expect that would be
the Blind Institute .”
The Arthur Shirley picture, “The Sealed
Hoorn,” is not going to help the sentiment in
favor of Australian pictures; some of the
local productions recently exhibited are as
bad as we might expect them to be if there
was a conspiracy between Australian pro-
ducers and American interests. But pic-
tures have been made locally which show
that Australians can hold their own with
the world's best; encouragement is only
needed to bring to the front the best work
and to create a local competition which will
stimulate producers to something more than
merely throwing imported melodrama into
local settings. “The Sealed Room” contains
crude excitement enough; but why republi-
can plotters against the throne of Ruvania
(a country which, incidentally, can be
reached at an amazing spewed, the trip by
aeroplane taking less than four days) should
choose Australia as a plotting-ground is
inexplicable; and why a man whose massive
wealth is frequently mentioned should in-
habit a bedroom much resembling a back
room in a second-rate Surry Hills lodging-
house is also unexplained. Arthur Shirley
is the airman, Craig, and does it woodenly:
apparently, whether he is Romeo or the dis-
coverer of a murder is all the same to him.
George Bryant is better; and the feminine
parts are well portrayed by Nellie Ferguson
and Grace Savieri. This is at the
Lyceum in Sydney. Hoyt’s shows “The
Ancient Highway,” a well-told James Oliver
Curwood adaptation, and the Pauline Fred-
erick picture, “Two Ivinds of Women.” “The
Vanishing Race” is to give a kick at the
Prince Edward on Friday.
“The Stage Cat” : A leaner time than ever
seems in store for resident actors who for
years have had to scratch for a living in the
country of their birth or adoption. Complete
company after company is being imported,
and the cry is still they come. Williamsons
have “White Cargo,” all Americans; Bouci-
cault’s Barrie eo., all English; and Renee
Kelly’s co., nearly all English, but slightly
leqvened with local performers. Hugh J.
Ward has imported a complete set of Ameri-
cans for his new comedy production, and has
expressed his intention of duplicating the
order. The Carrolls’ Melbourne theatre is
occupied by a similar organisation fro,m the
Pacific Coast. Perhaps the managements
will include stagehands and electricians in
their next consignments. The ’Uckerbvs and
’Arrops of the Theatrical Employees’ Union
are so keen on the importing busyness—as
regards pitchers, anyway—that they couldn’t
logically object.
“Ilamfat”: Sydney is to see another in-
teresting race against time in the job of
completing the upper theatre in the big St.
James’s building; Ben Fuller says it/will be
ready for the “Abie’s Irish Rose” co. on
December 26, and is willing to back his
opinion. So far only four storeys are up,
but the lower St. James’s Theatre was in
action on the due date in spite of the appa-
rent impossibility of that feat only a couple
of weeks before. Four spacious lifts, and
another for the performers, will fill and empty
the skyey playhouse as quickly as the job
can be managed in an ordinary ground-floor
theatre—the Fullers claim it will be the best
system of lifts in the world.
“Goldilocks”: Harry Green, who has de-
veloped the fancy that wise mummers have
for Australia, may stay on after the Adel-
aide season which is following his trip
through M.L. He has a Jewish play, “Twc
Blocks Away,” which has been a winner in
both the spoken and silent versions—the
latter is called “Two Kellys and a Cohen.”
“Bris” : The Queensland preference move-
ment is extending to the region of jazz
and jingle. A Queensland girl, Rita Mc-
Iver, has been inspired to write a song cele-
brating Montville, one of the high spots
of the Blackall range, as the place “where
the red-gold oranges grow.” The lyric has
been set to one-step music by J. Shanoski,
and Brisbane music-shops are making a dis-
play of it. It is a change from Yankee
jazz about the Mississippi and Tennessee,
at any rate.
“Short Circuit”: I went to see Barrie’s
“What Every Woman Knows,” at the Mel-
bourne King’s, with vivid memories _ of
George Musgrove’s production, and noticed
with pained surprise that the only member
of the Wylie family with a Scotch accent
was Maggie, whose haggis tang was admir-
able. Yet the playwright exhibits Maggie
as a scholar who taught he self French and
lays stress on her brothers’ lack of educa-
tion. John Shand, the Glasgow man, has
an accent reminiscent of a Lancashire
weaver. Truly, it’s a rare mummer who can
give even a passable imitation of a Scotch-
man, whereas there are hundreds who can
do an Irishman to the life.
“Hamfat”: Frank Harvey (B. l/7/’26)
is the 14th Wilfred Denver we have seen
in this country. George Titheradge was
Denver in the first Australian production of
“The Silver King,” in 1883; Lawrence Caut-
ley and George Rignold followed; then
Edward Sass, who had been the Smder in
Rignold’s show, stepped into the chief part
for a time. Walter Bentley, Scott Inglis
and King Hedley took a turn ; and Wilson
Barrett had two —in 1898 with Lillah Mc-
Carthy, the best of the Nellie Denvers, and
in 1901 with Maud Jeffries, who married
one of the Osbornes. Harry Plimmer, who
was the Spider with Julius Knight, had a
cut while the star was ill; and Julius played
Denver in 11)06, 1907, 1915 and 1916. Henry
Ivolker, William Desmond and Allan Wilkie
were the others, the last-named in 1919.
“Gaesar's Ghost”: Great War plays are
going well nowadays, and will go better as
time moves on. Sydney saw one very early
in the scrimmage. Archie Martin, who now
looks after J. C. Williamson’s Sydney pub-
licity, and Beaumont Smith wrote it in
three days and nights, and went on feverishly
to rope in stray actors and rehearse them in
their parts. In theory there should have
been a fortune in theatrical fare cooked
especially to feed the war-fever appetite;
but something went wrong. Only the woi-ms
fed on “The Clash of Arms” after the fifth
night.
“Caul-boy”: In the wave of sympathy for
Allan Wilk e, members of the cast, whose
losses in the Geelong fire were relatively
greater, are apt to be overlooked. Arthur
Keen, an Englishman, left for his home-
country a few days afterwards with nothing
but the clothes he
stood up in. Claude
Saunders, the Adel-
aide youth, lost all
his personal be-
longings, and
Alathea Siddons
returned to Sydney
similarly bereft. A
pathetic sight was
Bradshaw Major,
the orchestral con-
ductor, scrabbling
in the ashes for
the manuscript of
an opera on which
he had been en-
gaged for years.
Twenty of Wilkie’s
men and women
(there were 80
altogether) were
waiting on th e
J.C.W., Fuller and
Ward doorsteps
next day, but the
market is over-
crowded with im-
ported mummers.
The indomitable
Allan is busily pre-
paring fresh plans.
It is to be hoped
his helpers will get full consideration if the
phoenix rises from the ruins.
“Adam Ant” : I had a yarn with the late
Ward (“Tommy”) Lyons just before he left
Melbourne for London. “I may make a do
of it in the Big Smoke,” he said, “but it’s
always a toss-up in our game. That’s why
I'm ducking away quietly: I don’t want to
come back a failure after a big send-off. But
I’m feeling very unwell.” He had to be
taken off the boat at Fremantle, and died
in hospital at Subiaco on the very day he
was to have opened in London. His wife,
Marian Willis, hurried over to Westralia to
be near him at the end, and slipped on the
Perth platform, breaking her arm. She was
a patient in the hospital from which
“Tommy” passed on.
“Flaming Youth”: Mairc O’Neill and
Arthur Sinclair, who were here with the
financially unsuccessful Irish Players, for
whom old-timer Phil Walsh was manager,
have been married in London, where the
tyrannous Saxons have been treating their
shows rather well. The lady, when in Aus-
tralia, was the wife of G. H. Mail'; Sinclair
(real name McDonnell) was unattached.
J. M. Synge left Maire (Miss Allgood, as
she then'was, Sara Allgood’s sister) the copy-
right of his works. He died in 1909, two
years after Maire had made her first appear-,
ance at Dublin in “The Playboy of the
Western World.” “The Playboy” must have
turned her in some money in London, but
she didn’t get enough out of the Sydney pro-
duction to buy a box of face-powder.
“Machete”: Sir Barry Jackson, who has
made a failure of producing children’s plays
at Birmingham (Eng.), has been giving Ins
impressions of the modern child’s mentality.
He thinks his campaign failed because the
child-plays have not enough sex in them,
the guileless infants preferring the full-
blooded teachings of the fillums. Which
reminds me of when I was interested in a
weekly devoted to school games and competi-
tions, and was asked to make a few in-
quiries at newsagents’ as to how the pub-
lication was going. _ My first-and-only call
was at a shop opposite one of Sydney s big-
gest primary schools. It was lunch-time, and
the kids were popping in to buy a rag of
which there was a tall pile on the counter.
“That.” said the agent, “oh, that’s Sporty
Sptfflets. They’re mad on it for the
smutty yarns on the back page. Now, your
paper” But I fled.
“Machete”: Following on the plus-fours
production of “Hamlet” in London, Berlin has
staged Goethe’s “Faust” in modern dress.
Faust was garbed as a university professor
even less careful of his dress than most of
them: Mephistopheles wore the uniform of
stage iniquity—evening-dress and an opera-
hat. Critics objected to the presentation on
the ground that “Faust’' is a period play,
and does not fit the modern wise en scene.
Surely that is not true of the Devil, at least.
He is not for an age, but for all time.
“Aisle Seat” : Au Australian management
recently attempted to lure the Spanish singer
Raquel Meller from her beloved Paris, but
was told that she would as readily sail to
the Pole. London offered Raquel £4OO a
week without tempting her. After breaking
her American contracts twice, she has now
made a fresh one —for recitals. I saw the
draft copy in Paris. It called for fares for
five people and 'five dogs there and back.
The salary was 100,000 francs per week,
payable in French money.
“Uramao”: Recent references to inscrip-
tions on the tombstones of Johnny Sheridan
and Grattan Riggs remind me that, while
wandering round Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin,
UNKNOWN TERRITORY.
THE TENOR: “But, caro mio, surely you know this song — I’ve
often sung it in ‘Bohdme.’”
THE BUSH ACCOMPANIST : “No, Eve heard father talk about the
township, but I’ve never been there myself.”
in 1918, I came across the grave of Barry
Sullivan, who toured these parts many years
ago. The monument depicts the tragedian
with the skull of Yorick in his hand, and
bears the inscription: “After life’s fitful
fever he sleeps well.”
“Ann Hodge” : Marie Ney continues to do
well on the London stage. During January
ill-luck tore the leading lady from the cast
of O’Neill’s “Beyond the Horizon” 10 days
before the Sunday-night performance which
the Repertory Players were hilling. Along
came Marie, who put in some solid study,
and finished by scooping some fine notices.
Week-nights she was one of the Iluxtable
daughters in Bennett’s production of his own
“Madras House.”
“C. Ockney”: Barry Jackson, who pre-
sented “Hamlet” in plus-fours, threatens to
stage “Othello” at his Birmingham Reper-
tory Theatre in modern costume. Presum-
ably the colored hero will appear as an
up-to-date major-general and DeSdemona play
the last act in pink pyjamas. Shakspearean
idolaters are writhing under the infliction
of these freak performances. They maintain
that Jackson is doing more harm to the Bard
than ever American “picturisations” of his
work could.
“A.0.M.” (Lond.) : Oliver Bernard, who
did all the interior decoration for the British
Empire Exhibition, got high praise for a
show of architectural and stage decoration
which he has just held at the Abbey Gal-
lery. Bernard, who made a host of friends
in Australia as scenic artist of the Quinlan
Grand Opera, has become a very prominent
figure in art circles, and plies a ready pen
in the diffusion of his ideas. The Abbey
Gallery exhibition includes the original models
of the painted wooden soldiers which served
as pillars at Wembley. The little theatres
and the various miniature stage settings
make a very attractive show, and give some
fresh suggestions on the matter of perspec-
tive. When he was working on the Quinlan
scenery, one of his chief assistants was
Viscount Dangan, now Earl Cowley.
Fairyland comes to Sydney:—
It is at Farmer’s Gallery where Mrs. Ida
Rentcml Outhwaite has scattered elves and their
belongings; and what does it matter if there are
artistic deficiencies? Here is a child’s realm,
delightful to grown-ups, too, because of the love all
wholesome grown-ups have for the whimsicalities ol
children; whatever the faults, the subjects are sym-
pathetically treated, with a rare appreciation of color
delicacy here and there. The pictures vary from
“The Sea Sprite,” springing from a delightfully
green ocean, to the housewifely childish earnestness
of the figures in “Washing Day”; and there is en-
joyment in it all without thinking of things like
technique and draughtsmanship.
TREATING THE TART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Thank goodness I have more sense than to waste
money like this. I have a sweetheart with whom I
consider I am very generous. When we go to the
theatre I pay no more than Is. each for seats. We
generally take fruit in with us, or sometimes I buy
peanuts. Taken all round; it costs me about 3s. for
a night’s pleasure.”—Svu correspondent.
Let the spendthrift waste his guineas
In the gay life’s jazzy whir] ;
In a manner far more sober
I am lavish with my girl.
In those times of exultation
When the lust for spending prods—-
Why, I buy a bag of peanuts,
And we eat ’em in the gods.
Does she grumble? Not a murmur!
All my girls—there’s been a few,
And I pick ’em for their virtues—
Take, I think, the proper view:
There’s a vision of the cottage
That the happy future lends
In piling up hard savings
That a feller never spends.
I admit the girls I’m trailing
Very often disappear;
But it’s not the way I treat ’em
Makes ’em go. I often hear,
“Don’t be reckless, Herbert, will you?”
From the girl who by me plods
As we climb the old, steep stairway
With our peanuts to the gods.

8.G.R.L.: She's a grandma, t 00... .Circe
(and dozens of others) : Drowned in the flood of birth-
control matter. One thing is certain —a vast pro-
portion of the people are deeply interested in the
subject.... Loco: Yes, on further reflection we’ve
decided to regard “Really's” railway ganger as a
myth... .Ewolong: Afraid you haven’t been reading
your Bulletin very diligently... .Mary M.: Nothing
original there.... N.S.: Ditto.... W. Wagtail: Rather
too small a worm.. .. Danilo: Always a market for
personal pars.; the “regular article” is impossible.
.... F.W.T.: Much too long. I f the fish is good to
eat, does its ancestry matter ?.... Augustus W.: You
strike a mournful note that will appeal to many
hearts:—-
Once I was strong, a Youthful Lad ;
I was well, and gave as much as I had;
Opportunity I had what I would be,
but now no one has any Welcome for me.
.1 bad a Wealth of a Chance I should have took.
I gave it to a friend, and Wished him good Luck
Then bad Luck I had, no helping would he,
: for he then had no Welcome for me.
Friends in this World I have ever known;
I asked for help, they throw me a stone,
so, fellow men, this is really all true—-
if you are poor there is no Welcome for you.
N.L.D.: With a little weeding your vegetable
garden might d 0.... Mrs. R. P.: Some good fines;
many awkward lines; and why the gloom ?....
A.S.L.: “Back, back it comes, that dream of old.’
Right; it’s old, and it goes back... .W.H.L.: A
couple of them get nearer.... Echo: “Minuet is
dancing home....P. and S.: Of your dreadfully re-
iterated commands to the winds, this is selected: •
Blow winds, blow',
Yet softlv, tell the trees that thou are coming.
'Tis well, birds will nest and cease their strumming.
Then blow until the trees may shriek and groan.
Writhe, tossed hither, thither, beat her roots and
moan,
So blow.
The others are almost as weird. .. .G.A.P.; “Phantom’’
hasn’t a ghost of a chance... .Ego: You apologise for
“the work of an amateur at typewriting.” Ah, bur
it’s the tripewriting that really needs the apology.
P.P.M.: “Can These Dead Bones Live?” And we
answered and said “Lord, Thou knowest they cannot. ’
They are returning for burial... .Jimmy: We laughed
so much at your “humorous little sketches” tlrat
a visitor -wanted to know wdio had died... .D.R.E.:
You live in a picturesque part of the world where
there should be stories to;,pick up on every beach,
and send in piffling humors about parlor games !....
Mars: We can’t get up much excitement over “Joe.”
John C.: The yarn is not very convincing....
A. : Honestly, it couldn’t be much worse
B. : One original touch was “A tear stood o.i
my eye.” Any permanent injury ?... .G.R.S.: The
Bulletin declines to be the camel for “The Last
Straw”... .1.5. P.: Directly we found that your girl
was a “dove” we knew she had “gone above.” Why
not call her a “cow” and keep her “below” ?. ... 0.A.P.:
Lots of men are more interesting than your martyr.
.. . .P.L.T.: You send us five sets of verses, each with
a corpse in it. The market for dead bodies is over-
supplied. ...N.R.0.: Kissing the toes, of women surf-
bathers must be a queer amusement... .P.McM.: The
illicit romance heard by the cats under the bed
inspires no wild feelings of joy... .Klancy: “They
cast their shroud of dulness everywhere.” Not in
The Bulletin, thanks. .. .Creator: Your poetic world
is without form, and void. . . .R.H.: “Burning-Off”
rather jerky, but it should be worth while to perse-
vere. .. .J.K.8.: Do your tempests really rage “with
flashing skeletons and thund’rous ire”?....J. Sneezer:
Your “’Flu” is given a fly:—
Oh, ’Flu which will not fly,
From whom I cannot flee, s' .
’Tween cough and sneeze, I cry;
“How shall I ’scape from thee?”
Could I but flee,
No flea e’er flew
So swift. O ’Flu,
As I from you.
Accursed ’Flu,
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
. ...F.H.8.: The humor about it is that you should
think it funny... .L.L.: “Winter Day” failed to
warm us... .R. 8.8.: Your sentiments are fine; but
half a column or so to the effect that man is a
brute would weary some readers. .. .Mars: Both miss.
Barbara R.: Pretty; but you get your feet
tangled W.O. (Wellington) : You go a long way
without taking breath. „. .R.E.P.: R.I.P N.E.D. :
“This is exactly 2000 words.” Yes; that’s all it is.
R.N.S.: Those “Triolets” are reckoned amongst
the little things sent to try us. Most triolets are. .. .
J.D.: But Old Bill the Swagsman - has been saying
exactly the same thing ever since poets who never
carried a swag discovered him....C.5.: Evidently
the window-pane is a mortal spot -
’Twas here they shot the trooper down
In a way that was cowardly and low,
Though three to one the result they feared
• If they gave him an open go.
But what care they of the craven strain
Whether a deed be foul or fair ?
They shot him dead through his window-pane
As he sat in his office chair.
....Pat: Afraid the patriotic cheers the office gave
upon receiving your verse to the Prince of Wales is
the only reward you will receive... .J.H.L.: You
are a hard trier; why not write less and polish-,
more?... .P.T.C.: Unsuitable... .J.W.G.: “Borryin’”
would pay for revision. It’s too rough.... G.P.: Not
enough light in your reflections... .H.T.H.: Brightness
is the one excuse for parody. Yours fails.... J.M.: As
a rule, ladies with “a stately mien” are not allowed to
stalk through these pages, .. .G.T.S.: Not sufficient
subtlety... .Nemo: The sting doesn’t carry it; nor,
enough in the others, either... .Billie: “Twilight"
too dim... .W.J.D.: Overstrained.... A.A.L.: Not
enough, merit to justify its length.... Leo G.: Use a
saw and a plane to “Expectations” and it may do-
the point is good. .. . J.M.C.: The “romance” forced
into it is its ruin; as plain comedy it might go. .. .
A.M.8.: Your fancy rumbles ponderously in an old rut.
... .Marg McD.: You describe (20 lines) a deserted
house; then —“I wondered who had sojourned there.
Alack a-dayl Then went my way.” Is it worth
while building a house to say “Alack a-day!” in it?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
C.M.: A pair of lame ducks... .W.A.H.: There is
nothing of the Apollo Belvidere about the burly
bloke in the slop suit... .H.W.T.: Your prophecy of
the facial features of a race reared on condensed milk
terrifies us... .W.E.M.: Has been done better over
and over again... .H.L.M.: Too involved. Scrap half
the labels... .J.R.W.: Your progress towards perfec-
tion promises to be tortuous T.H.: The Sydney
taxi-cab war joke is too parochial... .A.S.H.: Wrong
diagnosis. > What the ’too needs is not an amputation
but a change of diet, viz., decentralisation.

Sales Dissection is an important figure job in any business. It answers your
questions: “Who is my best salesman?” —“Which is my most profitable line?”
—“Which is my most profitable department?”—“Do I sell more goods on credit
than for cash?”
With these and similar questions answered every day, you are able to make
comparisons with previous records, watch the trend of business, and provide suitable
safeguards against losses.
The Burroughs “Duplex” is the ideal machine for obtaining these facts. It is
actually “two adding machines in one,” for it gives the individual totals for each
salesman, department or line, and then a grand total of all sales automatically
without re-listing a single individual total.
Think of the importance of Sales Dissection for your business. Then think of
the time that the Burroughs “Duplex” will save in obtaining these essential figures.
Not only will it save time, but it will make the work so agreeable and easy that this
valuable information will be ready each day.
It will cost you nothing to ascertain how the Burroughs “Duplex” will benefit
your business. Just phone or write to our nearest office, and we shall be pleased
to arrange a free demonstration.

“011 a PodrirU i”: The old Kangaroo, after
over 40 years’ £a ithful service between Hobart
and Bellerive (' fas.), is now in the wreckers’
hands. The in terior of the ship shows the
tough qualities; of bluc-gum and kauri. The
heavy Din. by lOin. keelson is still solid,
and there is ni it a sign of rot anywhere in
the 70-year-old- hull. The old girl deserves a
niche in a mus eum, but is more likely to be
a coal hulk.
* * * *
“A.G.M.” (Home) : In the tramways here
there is an innovation which has much to I
commend it. “The lower curve of the strap- I
hanger’s noose is a rigid loop covered with
white enamel, -which is easily kept spotlessly
clean and at fl>nce shows any accumulation
of grease or cfiirt. Another feature is that
all journeys, Abort or long, on auto-bus or
tram, cost exactly the same—one penny in
English currency.
* * * *
"FY7”: The recovery of sea-salt will
soon be begun at Bowen (Q.). The, exten-
sive tidal flats, in the harbor will be the
scene of operations ; a few embankments will
confine the brine till it is strong enough,
through solar evaporation of the water, to be
pumped to the crystallising flats by the town
electrical power. Working costs are esti-
mated at 10s. per ton, and it is expected to
beat the South Aus. article in the home
markets at least. There is a big district
demand for salt in the meat-preserving trade.
* * * *
“Clericus* : Vic. Licensing Court has been
considering an application for a caravan-
serai to be erected in Spencer-street (Melb.).
Costing £210,000, it, like every other that is
built, will be “the most modern hotel in Aus-
tralia,” with five floors of bedrooms, each
with ’its own bath and ’phene and many
with beds that disappear into the wall dur-
ing the hours of daylight. The locality is
rather grubby; but it will be handy to the
long-distance trains. And, as the Hotel
Sydney has shown, that means a whole lot.
* * * *
“Te W.”: Old surgeon White, one of Gov-
ernor Phillip’s medical-men, first came across
the Australian anchovy. Not much use, so
far, has been made of this fish, which ranges
our coasts at certain seasons in immense
shoals. Yet it is almost identical with the
anchovy of commerce and could be put to
the same economic uses. A member of the
recent expedition of naturalists to the Capri-
corn group of islands, off the Queens-
land coast, records that he saw a white-
capped noddy vomit no fewer than 50
of the fishlets.
* * * *
“Crosshead”: Vic. Commissioner; Clapp’s
decision to equip locos, with headlights (B.
17/6/’2t>) is merely taking a leaf from South
Aus. Commissioner Webb’s book. Here the
locos., old and new, goods and express, are
all receiving attention, and some have been
equipped with headlights for over 12 months.
These have both dim and bright globes, the
blinding glare of full power being out of the
question in the station-yard. It is stated
that a newspaper can be read at 600 yards
in the full beam, and a greater measure of
safety is assured to both road and rail users.
* * * *
“C. Bumpkin” : The old Rotomahana, one-
time ocean greyhound, has finally entered
the knacker's yard in Melbourne. Built for
a yacht in 1877 she still has some fine fix-
ings and a firm has made an offer for the
saloon carvings in bird’s-eye maple to embellish
its city showroom. The Maori maiden who
contemplated the bow-wave for so many
years will probably go to a museum. But
the notice in the steerage instructing pas-
sengers to remove their boots before getting
into bed, which should have also been pre-
served as a bit of sociology, was pulped by
an unromantic breaker.
* * * *
“F.C.S.”: The “tiredness” of tailshafts
(B. 17/6/’26) may be accounted for by the
disturbance of normal molecular motion
caused by over-use; rest restores the mol-
ecules to' their regular orbits. A pair of
shears may lose their edge, and, after being
hung up for a period, cut perfectly again,
' and every shaver must have had a similar
experience with a favorite razor. On the
other hand, newly-smelted metal requires
careful use until the molecules “get into their
stride,” as it were. For this reason, in the
days of iron propellers, used metal, such as
old horseshoes and the like, was preferred for
casting. Cyclists, too, know that in riding
over rough country a new chain is more
Ijkely to snap than one comparatively worn.
# * * *
“Adelaide”: One of the biggest business
sites Adelaide has had to offer for years
East is now in the market, the recent com-
ined offices and power-house of the Electric
Supply Co., on East-terrace, opposite the
East End market and stretching all the way
■'from Grenfell to Pirie street. Long ago it
was the home of a leading soap factory, which
had a fire 40 years ago that old people speak
of with awe to this day. The Electric Co. has
lately run up a lofty set of offices in a more
central spot opposite the University, and
has its works away down at Osborne on the
Port River. The prublem is to make its
costly former building fit for any other pur-
pose. The machinery on the site, considered
only a few years back the last word in its
line, is being broken up with sledge hammers
for the sake of the metal in it.
* * * *
“Clerk”: Vic. railway engineers are won-
dering if the Diesel oil-electric locomotive,
which has just had its first severe working
test in America, is going to check electrifica-
tion in Clapp’s territory. The Diesel carries
its own power plant, works 24 hours a day
and operates on a low-grade fuel-oil at a
much cheaper rate than a steam or electric
engine. It costs nearly three times as much
as the average loco., but Yankee railroaders,
after standing aloof suspiciously when it
first appeared, are now scrambling to place
their orders; and several American com-
panies are delaying electrification until they
see how it turns out. Workshops manager
May, one of Clapp’s lieutenants at present
abroad, has instructions to look into the
matter, and it’s quite on the cards that Vic-
toria may be sporting a Diesel in the near
future.

The Out-of-date Methods
Shillings versus Pence
per yard
'THERE are two ways of doing
1 jobs such as trench-digging,
road-making and loading: the old
costly way of employing picks and shovels and
the economical way of using modern machinery.
In King “Tut’s” time, the primitive pick and
shovel was right enough, but the old methods
are as dead as those times are. These are days
of strenuous competition—if you would survive
you must do this class of work the new way—
the “Barber-Greene” way.
The Barber-Greene Ditcher.
The saving in trench excavation by using a
Barber-Greene Ditcher as compared with hand
labor is approximately 2/- to 3/6 per cubic
yard.
The Barber-Greene Loader
on a certain class of work has done a much
greater output than 40 men shovelling. It will
pay for itself many times over in the saving it
effects, loading Broken Stone, Sand, Gravel,
Scarified Road Materials, Coal, Clay, etc.
Portable Conveyors.
For loading or conveying loose materials from
pits, stock piles, etc., they may be fed by
hand or by bucket loaders.
We manufacture some of these
machines in our own works in
Australia under license to the
Barber-Greene Company.

The Wonderful
“LOCK-GRIP” WIRE STRAINER.
<§>
N9!6i(yi6
SIMPLE, POWERFUL, RAPID.
Time, Money and Energy Saved.
Here is a tool that absolutely eclipses anything in-
vented for the straining of fencing wires. It saves
hours on a job. Joins, tightens and repairs with the
utmost ease. Its enormous concentrated power makes
light of any fencing work —the hardest tensile wires

Auckland (MX.) is fortunate in its citi-
zens. David Goldie, an ex-M.P. who has just
died, left it 475 acres of beautiful bush, 24
miles away. Worthy institutions also benefit
to the tune of some £5OOO. David was a
conscientious Parliamentarian, a big pea in
Methody circles and a useful member ot
many public bodies. He was born in Tas-
mania in 1842 and hopped the pond in 1860.
“Centurion” : Even Army Orders have to
keep pace with the times, but the record
to date must be the recent notification to
all troops in India that they are liable, as
part of their duty, to go up in aircraft. The
British have lately been building ’planes de-
signed to carry a platoon of infantry with
all field equipment, which means that an
entire battalion, save, perhaps, the adju-
tant’s charger, can be carried for miles m
very short order. Landing will be the diffi-
culty, though the parachute may solve this.
With the prospect of hordes of parachutiers
descending suddenly from the clouds, a
new musketry course, with special instruc-
tion in the bringing down of birds on the
wing, will be imperative.
The latest proposal for solving the traffic
jamb at “the world’s busiest intersection,”
now under consideration by Melbourne’s
bumbles, is to burrow underground from
Collins-street to the Flinders-street railway
station along the Centreway. The resump-
tions will include part of the Mutual Store,
Lincoln Stuart’s, and a couple of banks*.
It would cost a lot of money; and whether
the public would patronise the long tunnel
is a moot question. London has plenty of
subways, but except during air raids it has
always been hard to get the people to duck
into them. They prefer to let the policemen
hold up the traffic while they step across the
surface. It is the one spell of power the
harassed pedestrian gets in this motor age.
According to the cable, ex-Governor Strad-
broke of Victoria has been “widely inter-
viewed” in London, and if he said the things
laid to his charge he deserved it. One of
them was that he had seen great changes in
Victoria (he was there from 1920 to 1926),
land which “a few years ago” sold at half a
crown an acre having gone up to £4OO, the
standing crop included. There is a great
cleavage, it seems, between the wage-earner
in an Australian town and the farmer
“amassing a fortune” but “living in loneli-
ness” —presumably where the howling wilder-
ness costs £4OO per acre. The statement that
there are no unemployed and no labor troub-
les in Victoria completed what read like a
nice friendly land-sale advertisement.
“Machete”: The Commonwealth coat-of-
arms, which is to go above the Speaker’s
chair at Canberra, has been carved from
Tasmanian blackwood by an Australian firm
of architectural carvers and makers of church
furniture. From the tradesman’s point of
view it is, I have no doubt, a. fine piece
of work, but, judging from published illus-
trations, the less said about it artistically
the better. The kangaroo and emu, which
“support” the shield, are rather worse images
than usual. It is curious that they have
almost invariably been grossly caricatured in
such instances. If designs had been invited
from Australian artists, our legislators would
have been spared, the constant contemplation
of a grotesquely' corpulent kangaroo and a
poultry-farm emu.
“H.K.” : Cables make frequent mention of
“Coo-ee” being heard at English sports
grounds and theatres nowadays; and, as a
rule, nothing happens but. answering coo-ees
and smiles. Yet the start of coo-eeing in
London was not a bit encouraging. When
Ballarat was in its golden prime a bush-
ranger named Harry Garrett coolly posted a
notice on the door of a bank that the place
would be closed for an hour. Then he saun-
tered in,closing the door behind him, terrorised
the officials with a revolver, and got clean
away with over £6OOO. The authorities
afterwards heard that he had been seen in
London, and a detective was sent from Mel-
bourne to lay hold of him. The officer
thought he saw his man in the Strand, and
struck the bright idea of testing his quarry
with a coo-ee. Everyone turned in astonish-
ment, except Garrett, who ran up to the
detective to ask what was wrong. His
loyalty to the old call cost him ten years.
“H. Hardupp”: The experience that fell
to the elder disciple, Shirlaw, is not to be
that of Meatheringham, the new Chidleyite
leader. Shirlaw established his now-defunct
communistic dwelling, “The Abode of Peace,’
at Berry's Bay, on the ideal of a simple life,
but found life anything but simple when he
was left to pay the rent of the big old place.
He discovered that he could get adherents
readily enough amongst the broke, but directly
they got money some of them brought beer
(in bottles or otherwise) into the premises,
and left without contributing to the rent.
Others got tired of the simplicity; one of
them told me: “I could have stood vege-
tarianism and the absence of beer, but sleep-
ing on boards beat me.” Meatheringham is
not like that at all. He made a lucky deal
in “residentials” that leaves him free to
pursue his “mission.” Something also comes
from the sale of his “Australian Anthem,”
which readily fetches sixpence a copy after
he has recited it at his meetings. The amount
ln> has already collected for his verse would
turn Rod Quinn green with envy.
National trading being somewhat of a
habit, it might be a brilliant idea if the sale
of small firearms could be made a Federal
monopoly and put under strict control. No-
body wants the handy little revolver to kill
rabbits or eagles with, and it isn’t necessary
even for dogs. People buy the thing to use
against other people, sometimes for defence,
often for crime. It might prevent Australia
becoming like the U.S. if the baby gun could
be legally supplied onlv by the Common-
wealth Bank or some such institution, and
only on very satisfactory cause being shown.
Surreptitious trading in easily-concealed
weapons, or importation or illicit distillation
thereof, could be made heavily punishable,
also the giving away of his weapon by the
legal possessor. He should have no legal
way to get rid of it save by selling it back
to the bank as a second-hand article, and
when he dies it should be sold back by his
executors. Australia might then progress
with giant strides towards a blessed time
when the handy homicide would have to
do without explosives. After that some
genius might find a way of restricting the
bottle as a weapon of offence.

]VrOT yet eleven. Perhaps it was not
1 too late. Still it was rather a vague
clue. Was it worth risking a fare?
He hesitated, missed a tram, then decided
to go, and rushed down the ramp to the
station. The train tumbled him out at a
raw outer suburb where buildings were going
up like mushrooms. Someone had told him
a contractor there wanted a man. They
hadn’t specified a carpenter or painter or
any tradesman, so perhaps it was just a man
and he could fill the bill.
He found the buildings—three long, thin
single-fronted villas, looking as though some-
one had flattened them so with a pair of
butter-patters. It was drizzling rain, and
the unmade footpaths splashed yellow mud.
The foreman paused to wipe little beads
of sweat from his lined face with the back
of his hand—the palm seemed scarcely differ-
ent in texture from the mortar-covered trowel
he held in the other.
“A job? What sort of a job d’ye want?”
he asked.
“Anything at all,” Nichols commenced
eagerly.
It was a false step. The foreman’s face
hardened. “Anything! That means no-
thing, I suppose. Can you do a plumbing
mb without getting us into a row with the
Board?”
i in not a plumber,” Nichols said sulkily.
“Well, young feller, you'd do better to
master one job instead of this ‘anything’
bag of tricks.” The foreman’s voice was a
mixture of kindness and irritation.
Nichols turned abruptly to the road again.
It stung him to be taken for an unskilled
jack-of-all-trades. He was a skilled trades-
man—a printer. But if ever there was a
surplus of any sort of tradesmen in the city
there surely was one of printers just then.
His mind harked back to the night, nearly
three months ago, when he was fired. Just
a bit of a breeze with his employer. He
always hated old Doughlass and the mawk-
ish, semi-religious publications he worked
on. Always trying to get a bit of over-
time without paying for it. He was glad
he had spoken his mind that night at the
finish. It had seemed such a simple matter
then to chuck it and get a better job. But,
Lord! What rotten luck had been his—
what months of fruitless searching for em-
ployment !
He was a good enough printer, too; not
top-notch, perhaps, but -. He wondered
why he had become a printer. He had had
a job round an office when a lad, and by
degrees it had given him a chance to pick
up the trade. Why on earth hadn’t he be-
come a plumber? People always wanted
plumbers and paid them handsomely.
Plumbers were a necessity. People must
have water laid on and drains. They coiftldn’t
import their plumbing, like their books, from
overseas.
Subconsciously his footsteps had led him
to an open park space. He sank down upon
a seat, . drawing his thin, damp overcoat
round him. It was rotten to be out of work
in winter. If only it wort' summer one
would not feel the cold so. One would not
feel so hungry. Tramping round wouldn’t
be so hard on one’s boots. Fuel, food, every-
thing was dearer in winter.
It was dinner-time. That hollow feeiing
within shouted the fact at him. Bread land
tea are not a sustaining breakfast, and day
after day so many meals had been of bread
and tea. He jingled the coins in his pocket
and deliberately decided he would go with-
out. If he could not work he would not eat.
Starvation might spur him on to something!
The men on the building opposite had
stopped work. They had made a fire in an
oil-drum, and were cooking some sort of
hot drink. One man had something—Ger-
man sausage, it looked like—on a pie«e "of
wire toasting before the flames. The savour
that came to him was torture. lie would
go over and ask for a hot drink. They were
good fellows. They might lay him on to
something.
He half-rose to his feet. One of the men
looked at him curiously. He sat down again
drawing from his pocket part of a news-
paper, as if that had been what he wanted
all the time. He scanned over the wanted
column once more. He had read it at dawn
that morning, as on so many other morn-
ings when he had chased after every likely
job within his radius.
He turned again to the country jobs. He
had been offered one —£1 a week and sleep
in a shed. What was the good of that? He
couldn’t take his family there. Nor could
he keep them in town on a pound a week.
A single man could go anywhere, live any-
how, but there were Alma and the kid and
the one that was coming. Suddenly he
thought of Alma taking in sewing and keep-
ing things going, and he winced.
In distraction he turned to the business
and partnership page. What couldn’t a man
do if he had a bit of capital? One must
have money to make money. There was
advertised a little news-agency business in
particular. It riveted liis attention. Offered
for £2OO cash, and a turnover of £5O a week.
It was just the sort of job he was fitted for.
A smart man could make something out of
that. Fancy missing a fortune perhaps for
want of £2OO.
He began to go over the ground again.
Why hadn’t he anything saved up himself?
It was strange—all these years of steady
employment and nothing to show for it but
a few bits of furniture. He blamed Alma.
Yet he knew it was just as much his own
fault. What they had spent in tawdry
amusement—it would have been a tidy sum
by now. If only they’d had the sense!
Rain was coming down with steady drip,
drip through the leaves. He got up from the
wet seat with an oath. Nothing doing to-
day. Would, it be better to tramp and wear
out one’s boots or squander a fare?
He tramped. Through sodden, rain-soaked
miles he walked, it seemed, between rows
of houses crouching back with closed doors
and curtained windows in very fear of the
rent-collector. Here and there thin spirals
of smoke spoke of mean fires, meanly fuelled.
There was a shroud-like suggestion in the
glimpses of washing flapping on the lines.
He met women hurrying home with shopping
bags. One and all he felt they had been
haggling with grocer and baker and getting
cheated. He passed some ragged children
sailing driftwood down the flooded gutters.
He idealised them as elf's imprisoned. Why
were they not set free in open, sunny spaces?
He hated the miles and miles of hard road
and wall that were the city. Road and wall,
that’s all it w r as, with wealth of merchan-
dise behind barred doors for the few. He
loathed it; as one must come to loathe an
environment in which one is a failure.
lie paused at last beside a fruit barrow.
Ah, that was the occupation he should have
chosen, fruit-growing. He might have been
liis own boss, owned his own house, worked
what hours he chose and brought up his
children in healthy surroundings.
Apples, red and yellow. He would take
some home. He had earned that much by
going dinnerless.
He mounted a tram with a bag of frag-
rant Jonathans under liis arm, and looked
around him jealously. The car was crowded
with people going home from work. He
felt an alien amongst them, and palpably
so, as if even the conductor could dis-
cern it. For he was going back from not
■working to a home that tottered on the brink
of ruin. A home had to have some sort of
financial foundation. Hove alone couldn’t
keep it going.
He looked around him savagely. He'd
like to preach to these young fools, not to
save them, but to urge them to save, save,
save. There were the three young fellows
wrapped up in to-morrow’s pony-racing
chances. There were the three girls and two
youths who had joined the tram outside the
big drapery store, and probably had most of
their salary on their backs. And another
couple he suspected of being in love and
utterly oblivious of the need of money, now
or at any other time, beyond their tram
fare. Well, let them wake up and learn.
He got off at his stop, a weary misanthro-
pist. And the worst was yet to come. Long
before he reached the gate he braced him-
self to meet it. He even raised a little
whistle as he opened the front door.
“Daddy!” The child ran to meet him.
Oh, damn! With annoying after-wisdom
he realised he should have got home in time
to take her out somewhere; even for a walk
under the shop verandahs. Alma hated
going out now, and besides she was always
busy. And the child was cooped up all day.
Why couldn’t lie think of things in time?
Was that the real reason of his failure?
Alma was where lie knew she would be,
sewing-table drawn up to catch the last
light of the short day, sewing sequins on an
evening-dress.
For a fraction of a second she raised her
eyes to his with that silent query in them.
That was what lie had dreaded. He made
a sort of bluster of the business of getting
out of his wet overcoat, as if he would
drown that silent question, and divert atten-
tion from the equally silent, dejected answer.
“Any mail?” he asked over liis shoulder.
He knew it was a ridiculous question.
There hadn’t been any for ages. But any-
thing to make talk!
Alma’s voice came evenly and faraway-
sounding to his ears. “There’s one from
Doughlass. He wants you to go back and
let bygones be bygones.”

POLICE-CONSTABLE Patrick Mac-
Ginnis was disturbed. As that par-
ticular portion of the Strong Arm of
jNT. S. Wales Law that made safe the slum-
bers of the. hundred-odd inhabitants of the
bush township of Bulliwagga, life had proved
a calm for Patrick. And now that calm
was in danger of being disturbed by a dirty,
ragged specimen of —Patrick couldn’t find
words to describe the curious bit of humanity
that stood before him in the tiny room, humor-
ously labelled with the sign “Police Station.”
The Patrick MacGinnis of Yesterday who
had called forth unwilling admiration from
the instructing-sergeant in Sydney came to
the rescue. Patrick straightened in his chair

KEEP DOAN’S IN THE HODSE!
PROMPT TREATMENT PREVENTS KIDNEY COMPLAINT
BA.CKACHE, urinary disorders, puffiness about the
eyes, swollen ankles, rheumatic twinges and dizzi-
ness are early signs of kidney trouble. Never neglect
such warnings! Rheumatism, stone, dropsy or incurable
stages of kidney disease may result. Keep a bottle of
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills always in the house.
Doan’s Pills are not only curative in their effect —they are also a preventive kidney medicine. Even
when well, you should take an occasional course of Doan’s to fortify the kidneys.
TWO COMPLETE CURES.
Mrs. S. T. Burrows, 19 Springsidc Street, Rozellc, Sydney,
says“ln common with many others I have nothing but good
to say for Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. Some few years ago
1 was suffering a lot with my kidneys, and in consequence was
troubled with pains across the small of my back and dizzy
feelings, besides having no energy for anything. One day my
attention was called to Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and in
the hope that they might benefit me I got a bottle. After taking
them for a few days my health began to improve, and by the
time 1 had used six bottles I was completely cured. I am
grateful to Doan's Pills for tin' good they have done me. and
hope many will profit by my experience and use this splendid
remedy. 1 never suffer with backache now, in fact, feel splendid
in every way.”
Six years later Mrs. Burrows says“l have had no reason
to alter my good opinion of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They
cured me some years ago, and I am still well.”
TESTIMONY
FROM
SYDNEY.
Mr. W. J. Frappell, who lias been in the employ of Messrs.
Wright, Heaton and Co., Sydney, for nearly thirty years, says :
“It gives me pleasure to testify to the curative value of Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills. I had been suffering with an aching
back for a number of years, and at times it w T as very severe.
After trying many remedies without getting any ease whatever,
I was advised to take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I did so,
and from the first few doses got relief, and after using three
bottles I was entirely free of backache. I am thoroughly cured,
and hope this statement will meet the eye of other sufferers and
be the means of them getting relief through the use of Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills.”
Twenty-two years later Mr. Frappell says:—“l am still
a great believer in Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They cured
me many years ago, and I find by taking this remedy now and
then that I am able to keep free from the torture of backache.”

and fixed the little man with a judicial eye.
“Now, what th’ hell are you trying to put
over me?” demanded the voice of Patrick
of Yesterday. Not a brilliant or subtle re-
mark, you will agree, but one that had the
desired effect upon the little man who had
awakened Patrick from his afternoon patrol.
Patrick’s visitor wilted before the stern eye
of the Law. But only for a minute. With
an effort at composure, he met the other’s
eye, and in a trembling voice repeated the
statement that had disturbed the constabu-
lary calm.
“I have murdered the fat man in the
agent’s office,” he said. “Strangled him with
these,” he added excitedly, and held out two
small, grimy fists for the other’s inspection.
MacGinnis glared in amazement. So he
had heard aright. This bald-headed, five-
foot of rags and dirt was actually claiming
to have murdered the agent. For a minute
MacGinnis chewed the statement over as a
dog sniffs at a new and doubtful delicacy.
Then he rejected it, and lying back in his
chair he laughed until the tears ran down
his rugged cheeks and the castle of N. S.
Wales authority shook to its very founda-
tions with the mirthful convulsions of the
substantial minion of the law who reigned
over it.
The effect of MacGinnis’s behavior on his
visitor was surprising. He looked hurt. His
lips quivered with nervous annoyance. He
stood in front of the constable like some
child who is being laughed at for trying to
“put over” some masterpiece of childish fib-
bing. And, like the child, MacGinnis’s visi-
tor seemed very close to tears.
“Oh, it’s always the same. You damned
Australians won’t believe I can do anything
but push a pen!” he shouted petulantly.
His voice restored MacGinnis to com-
posure. Straightening himself, he fixed the
little man with pitying amusement in his eye
and wagged an admonishing forefinger. “Now
you caii run back to your mates and tell
’em I’m not as silly as I look,” he chuckled.
“The flaw in your story is the strangling
part. Being as I was beaten by that same
agent in last year’s wrestling finals at the
sports, and being as I could break you in
two with one hand, I’m going to wait for a
better yarn before I rush out searching for
corpses.”
Having administered this rebuke Mac-
Ginnis calmly proceeded to fill his pipe while
he watched the little man with amusement.
But instead of complying with the other’s
advice the little man repeated his statement.
“I tell you it’s the truth. I strangled him
because lie drove me to it. I—oh, why don’t
you believe me?” he persisted tearfully. But
Patrick only grinned. Tugging nervously
at the ragged lapel of his coat, “If I tell you
the whole story maybe you'll believe me?” he
demanded with some show of spirit.
Patrick laughed. “Go ahead, mate,” he
invited indulgently. “I wouldn't spoil a good
joke for anything. Let her rip, my son;
it's a good day for listening, and tea won't
be ready for another hour." lie settled com-
fortably in his chair and prepared to be
amused.
The little man wasted no time in com-
mencing. "My name,” he said, “is John
Smith. You see, I was deprived even of the
stimulant of an unusual name,” he remarked
with a hopeless shrug of his thin shoulders.
“As you will have learned from my voice,
I come from London, born in Tooting forty
years ago, and destined to be cursed with
the mark of the commonplace from the day
I opened my eyes and let out a commonplace
yell into the commonplace atmosphere of
that commonplace London suburb. My father
was a clerk, and my mother had been a
typist. My relatives and friends were all
clerks; Tooting clerks. Until I reached my
thirty-sixth year I had met nobody more
romantic than the liftman where I worked
as a clerk for twenty years. He had been
a sailor for a few years, and for that he
earned the adoration of my romance-starved
soul. From my boyhood days until my great
opportunity arrived, I lived in an atmosphere
of stodgy respectability. Life was one
damned penpoint after another, and I hated
it!”
The little man’s voice rose to a shrill cre-
scendo, and meagre, clenched fists strove to
emphasise the agony he felt at the thought
of those youthful days.
“God, how I hated it all! Where it came
from I do not know, but firmly imbedded in
my commonplace little body was the soul
of an adventurer. I dreamed of the deeds
I might do if I had the chance. I saw my-
self leading forlorn hopes; I pictured myself
battling with the elements as captain of a
hell-ship; I fought lions and tigers, and
strangled them with my bare hands.” The
little man’s voice sank to a hopeless note.
“And then I would wake up from my dreams
and curse Tooting and ledgers until I cried.
“Lord, if you could only understand how
I prayed for something to happen ! If the
building I worked in would only catch fire !
But not even, a runaway horse came near
me. I was destined to be commonplace for
all time. Then came my Great Opportunity.
The office where I worked belonged to a ship-
ping company, and was situated close to the
East India Docks. In my lunch-hour I often
walked round the dock-side and watched the
sailors at work. It was vinegar to my thirst,
but at least it got me a little closer to my
desires.
“One day as I stood on the dock head
watching a big liner prepare to cast off and
envying the men working on her, I heard a
voice behind me. I turned to find a ship’s
officer standing beside me. Without giving
me time to speak he barked out. ‘Steward,
aren’t you? Well there’s a job for you if
you will come now,’ He hooked a thumb
towards the vessel I was watching.
“I don’t know what I replied, but when I
recovered from my stupor I was being sup-
plied with a white uniform and the tugs
were towing the ship past Woolwich.
“Can you imagine my joy?- I had made
my escape at last. I was a sailor.- a run-
away. a deserter. In Tooting there was a
wife I had married because it is common-
place for a poor clerk to marry before he
can afford it. There were also several child-
ren ; untidy, noisy, commonplace children,
and I left them ail without regret. Adven-
ture had come iny way at last and I steeped
in it—until the chief steward discovered I
didn’t know my job. He cursed me for a
clumsy-handed farmer and demanded to know
what I was. I told him, and they turned me
over to the purser, who gave me the job of
looking after his books.”
The little man looked up into the fat con-
stable’s face in hopeless misery.
“You see I was a commonplace clerk, and
a commonplace clerk I remained all that voy-
age to Australia. Cooped up in a stuffy cabin
poring over those books was worse than my
previous state. For here I was in the midst
of romance yet a thousand miles from it.
Only at night could I creep on deck and
feast my hungry soul on the sight of sea
and sky.
“When the ship touched Sydney I deserted.
Here in Australia I should find romance, I
thought. Here in the land of pioneers I
should take the place my heart desired;
obtain the work I craved for. But I walked
Sydney’s streets for two weeks and, finally,
was forced to a desk again. The labor
agencies would have none of me. My appear-
ance was against me. Useless for me to
swear I knew station work. They looked me
up and down, smiled, and told me to call
again.
“I stuck my clerking job for two weeks.
But oim day the sun shone too brightly to
be suffered in that stuffy office, and L threw
my pen out of the window and marched from
the office. The boss tried to stop me, but
I cursed him until he ran back with a scared
look in his eyes. The day following that
episode I was high up in the mountains with
m,v face turned to the westward. Surely
there was something waiting for .me in the
bush. 1 starved my way past Forbes and
commenced my search.
"Bur the bush judged me as the others had
judged. Station managers laughed and patted
me on the shoulder as though I were a
child. They gave me food, but when I asked
for a job they offered me a book-keeper’s
billet. Five times I was chased from home-
steads for what I told the managers when
they offered me that.
“At night I would lie sobbing by my fire,
sobbing with disappointment. I wanted to
ride ar. outlaw and they offered me a clerk’s
chair, I wanted to swing an axe and they
offered me a pen. I cursed every pen that
was ever manufactured and I felt. I could die
happy if I could drown Mr. Stephens in his
own blue-black ink.”
Exhausted with his anger the little man
sank into a chair and looked dazedly at his
listenei. Then waving his hand with that
hopeless gesture he continued : “You wouldn’t
understand the hell my life became. I seemed
to be haunted by ledgers and pens, until if
I saw one in the houses I called at I would
turn and run for my life. Quill-driven I
called tnis madness of mine.
“That was my life for four years. I wan-
dered all over this continent searching for
tlie job that would give me the action and
romance my soul craved, and all I got was
a pitying smile and advice to go back to the
cities where I fitted in. I cursed them for
their blindness and continued my search.
To-day 1 walked into this township and
applied at the agent’s office for work. When
the usual refusal came accompanied by that
pitying smile I have grown to hate, I lost ah
control, and sinking on my knees in front
of the man I cried: ‘For God’s sake give me
some sort of job.’ Feverishly I told him my
story, and as I spoke I could see the pity
in his face deepen. Finally he lifted me to
a chair, and looking down at me kindly he
said. ‘Sure, I can fix you up, son.’
“I could hardly believe my ears. A job
at last! I rose and grasped his arm.
“‘Where?’ I demanded. ‘Where is the
station?’
“He smiled, and, reaching round, brought
forth a large book, the sight of which brought
hated memories. He opened the book and
placed it in front of me. As he pushed the
pen and ink towards me, I leapt on him!”
Patrick MacGinnis stared, fascinated by
the mad glitter in the little man’s eyes. In
a wild voice the little man shouted :
“That was when I killed him ! For offer-
ing me that cursed ledger and pen 1 bent
him across the corner of his own desk and
I strangled him with these two hands!”
The little man’s fingers worked feverishly.
“Strong though he was, he hadn’t a chance.
I seemed gifted with the strength of fifty.
You’ll find his body lying there,” lie finished
simply.
The placid stream that represented the
course of Patrick MacGinnis’s duty was in
turmoil. Patrick sat with eyes seemingly
glued on the ragged heap in the chair before
him. Again the Patrick of Yesterday came
to the rescue and with an excited oath the
constable rose from his chair. In a trice he
had placed a small table in front of his
visitor. On this table lie placed a writing-
pad with a picture of a famous actress on
its cover. Collecting a cheap pen and a
bottle of ink from a cupboard, lie placed
these on the table. Then he shook that
ragged shoulder and pressed the cheap pen
into the small fingers.
“Here! You get that down on paper for
evidence. Damned if I don’t believe you !”
lie ordered.
The little man looked dazedly up into
Patrick’s face. Then his fingers felt the
pen. lie looked down at it and from it back
to the other man with a wild look in his
eyes. One leap took him from the chair;
another, and he was facing MacGinnis. With
the hated pen in his fist, he leapt at the
constable.
* * * *
Half an hour later, Police-Constable
MacGinnis, sole representative of the law
of N. S. Wales in the bush township of
Bulliwagga, leaned wearily against the wall
of the room humorously labelled “Police
Station.” In his hands he held a smoking
revolver. Blood trickled down his face from
numerous cuts and scratches. His clothes
were in shreds. The body of a little man
lay stretched on the floor in front of him.
In the tightly closed fist of the dead man
was the stump of a cheap pen.
MacGinnis looked dully at the body. “Now
what the hell made him go off like that?”
he muttered as he sank to the floor exhausted.
