The Red Page
The English Sneer still inhabits its lair in The
Athen/EUm (London), rlt is a strange beast. Give
it crude gobbets of melodramatic adventure, ragged
chunks of “wild” Australian life, and it will swallow
them eagerly. For what else is to be expected from
wild and hairy beings living on the fringe of civilisa-
tion ? So the English Sneer gratefully accepts as
genuine Australian literature the pretentious piffle
of Raphael Sebatini: it is sufficiently crude and
"wild” to deceiv? the gentle, spectacled beast that
has its lair in T/te Atjienjcum. But proffer the
animal poetry refined and pure; and it turns from
it in distaste. That is the sort of stuff it expects
from England, whereas everyone knows that these
hardy mountaineers of the desert, these beach-
comers of the bush, these bushrangers of the man-
grove-swamps write their poems on gum-leaves in
their own rich, colonial blood! This page, approv-
ing of The Athenaeum’s review of Gervais Gage’s
From Far Lands, protests when the English Sneer
snorts:—
“It is a foundling of the Australian Muse —volu-
minous, pert, self-confident, and full of jerky com-
monplace, dressed up in colloquial phrase, falsetto
sentiment and vague rhetoric.”
The poets we claim as ours do not know that Muse.
And this page is pained when, in speaking of Freda
du Faur’s The Conquest of Mount Cook, the
Athenaeum Sneer almost chokes over its astonish-
ment at finding that an Australian girl could write:
"Yet she has somehow managed to acquire an
admirable literary style, which betrays few traces,
except in exciting moments, of her Colonial extrac-
tion.”
However, in fairness to the English Sneer, which
has somehow managed to acquire an admirable liter-
ary style, may not this be one of those exciting
moments when the beast betray* traces of its English
extraction ?
The Distant Fiction-market that
Looks Blue
A dozen years ago it was the fashion for
writers, known and unknown, to make for
London on the slightest provocation. One
imagined, I think, an eager English public
waiting breathlessly to be delivered from the
contemplation of Brixton and Little Pedling-
ton. There was the Boer War; there was
the alleged curiosity of the English about the
daily life of the boys who could ride and
shoot with such paragraphed dexterity. And
kailyards were being exploited: why not
turn the Bush'into a kailyard? There
seemed plenty of provocation at the time
when Blackwood’s Magazine was printing
Lawson’s short stories, Abbott was whisper-
ing into The Spectator’s ear, and other
Australians were discovering Bond-street to
its denizens.
My own provocation was of the slightest.
A few manuscripts sent to a London literary
agent (and forgotten) came to light again
in the shape of a couple of glossy magazines
and a fat cheque. At least it seemed fat —•
a dozen years ago. That it was the first
money I had ever earned by writing fiction
didn’t make it seem any the less a direct
incentive from Heaven to go abroad and lux-
uriate. An accessory before the fact was
Arthur Hoey Davis, who suggested that
unless I meant to turn his magazine into a
propagandist pamphlet for National Art I
had better find a wider field than Brisbane.
All that was needful in London, apparently,
was a handful of mulga yarns, a breezy man-
ner, and a couple of introductions. But in
those days I didn’t think the last important
enough to bother about.
London is a city that destroys one by feed-
ing his illusions for a while. Five weeks
after I landed I was reading a proof of an
article for The Nineteenth Century, then
edited by Sir James Knowles, and reputed
to be inaccessible to everyone but peers and
retired colonels. My own article was some-
thing about the Corroboree and Folk Art. But
I am not sure whether it was The Nineteenth
Century or Answers that took work of
mine first! At any rate it was the editor of
some publications of the Answers type who
taught me what the English public really
wanted. He was an assiduous person, a
conscientious person, one of the few I have
known who really read through the stories
submitted to them. He read them through
carefully, and took out the best ideas. It
was his theory that amateurs always had
the freshest plots and professionals the
freshest style, and for some insufficient rea-
son he classed me with the professionals.'
After some struggles with an (as yet) un-
tamed conscience, I consented to write
stories roudd the plots he gave me, at a flat
rate of a guinea a thousand words.
It was a mere convenience of arrangement,
he affirmed. There could be no real larceny
of plots, for there were only 27 in the world;
and the best for popular usage was the one
about the bold, bad man (bushranger, soldier
or stockbroker) who was reformed by a little
golden-haired child.
Later on there appeared another editor,
who used to send me pictures around which
to write stories. His was a wealthy pub-
lishing firm with branches all over the map,
but he considered it sinful extravagance to
use a block only once. And generally the
story and illustration fitted better the second
time of using, for it was easier for the
writer to look at the picture than for the
artist to read through the manuscript.
There is always plenty of this sort of
hack-work in London for anyone who gets
through the inner doors of editorial offices
and has the industry and ingenuity of a
beaver or a fox. I found myself getting
taken up by one magazine after another,
with puffs and introductory paragraphs,
and (instead of cash) promises of a brilliant
future. But it wasn’t The Literary Life I
had come to London to lead. I was sitting
in a back room in Bloomsbury, working a
typewriter and never getting high enough
rates to buy leisure in any satisfying quan-
tity. And meanwhile there was a revolu-
tion going on in Russia, men sprawling on
the sand at Bondi, and cattle being drafted
on the Western stations. So I drifted Out-
back, by way of Finland and Yokohama, and
gave over the pen for a while.
At this point one meets the question of
whether success lies in keeping in personal
touch with editors or working through an
agent. Most Australians on this side have
an illusioh"that it is the personal touch that
works the oracle. Alas!.... To a certain
extent it may be true in New York, but in
London editors change a little more often
than the fashions, and are generally less
worth cultivating than their cashiers.
Charles Hands, of The Daily Mail, used to
say that when he was going away on a jour-
ney he always raised his hat to all the lift-
boys at the office, for he didn’t know which
one of them might be in the editorial chair
when he came back.
The best friend an Australian writer can
have is an agent who believes in him. And
the latter must be caught young. There
are a good many agents in London who are
merely names at the top of a large adver-
tisement, and their standing asset is a testi-
monial from some writer who flourished 30
years ago. The agent who undertakes, for
a preliminary fee, to send manuscripts out
a dozen or 20 times is to be avoided like the
plague or the advertiser of cheap jewellery.
Generally he calculates his income at the
amount of his prelim, fees, minus a small
sum for postage stamps. The best agents
want nothing but their commission on work
sold, 10 per cent, in England and 15 per cent,
abroad.
And the best agents are, with one or two
exceptions, Americans. In New York it is
not. the general custom to sit on a swivel-
chair and send things out mechanically by
post. The Yankee agent picks out the editor
he thinks would harmonise best with you
socially and asks him to meet you at a good
dinner or a quiet game of pool. Subtly,
when the atmosphere is convivial, he pumps
your best stories out of you, and by the time
the editor is interested he has casually un-
veiled the fact that you are a writer—with
something surprisingly fresh and original to
talk about. Very often he doesn’t handle
your manuscript at all. He trusts to your
honor, to return him his commission when
the pigeon has been plucked.
Personally I have lost most of the ground
gained from time to time through trying to
cut out the agent’s commission. My early
experience of the accessibility of editors had
filled me with a belief that the middleman
was not worthy of his hire. But when I
went back to London five or six years ago
I found that editors had been reshuffled and
prices had fallen even lower. Moreover, I
was probably too fresh from the realities of
“wild life” to write about them with, the
literary convincingness demanded by Brixton
and Little Pedlington. I had to begin again.
And the system had changed. One firm
that went in extensively for all-fiction maga-
zines (it is still the chief trader in that
commodity) had formed its own little group
of writers. It did not want the bother of
reading outside work, for its editors were
mostly unskilled persons, and, moreover, its
theory was that all fiction was very much
alike and that the public was an animal
with an unenthusiastic, but steady, appetite
for anything put before it. So it preferred
to contract with a few authors to supply
so many stories a month at a cheap rate.
The quality of the goods did not matter, nor
did the standing of the authors; any names
could be boomed into notoriety by repeating
them month after month in a hoarse voice,
and there was no danger of the general pub-
lic asking the reason why. From time to
time I have heard a few people speculating
on the reason w 7 hy, but they were mostly
interested, professional persons.
In New York things are different.
American editors encourage their readers
to talk about the stories they print, and they
have an expert staff to read manuscripts. If
they are interested in your w 7 ork they will
pursue you even to the doors of your hotel.
They send back chatty notes about your
stories, even when they do not print them:
they read other magazines and remember
your work. The only English editor I ever
knew who took such trouble with short
stories was Frank Harris... .But was Frank
ever an English editor? I believe he claims
now that he has been an American citizen
for the last 25 years, and somehow I never
remember hearing him speak disrespectfully
of the Jews.
With regard to prices, English and
American, there is much mystery and not a
little dissimulation. I have heard men talk
in clubs and other places, but I have never
seen their cheques or sought to borrow
money on the strength of their conversation.
My own confession is lamentably unexciting.
An orderly series of notebooks tells me that
in the last ten years I have contributed to
over a hundred papers and magazines, Eng-
lish and American; and I have never been
paid more than £2O for a story, rarely that.
Magazine short stories have averaged from
30s. to three guineas per thousand words in
England, and about double that rate in
America. Articles in reviews like The
Fortnightly, The Nineteenth Century,
The British Review and The New
Statesman have panned out at something
like two guineas a thousand.
As for serials, my first sold for £80 < to an
editor who was said never to have paid less
than £2OO for a serial before. I knew him
personally, and can derive some consolation
from the knowledge that the story, in the.
light of eternity, was worth far less than he
gave. It was about an Englishman in the
cattle-country. Pride would not let me
offer it in book-form, in spite of the tempta-
tions of the Devil:
My second and third serials were bought,
promptly enough, by Munsey’s in America,
but at a price which the agent apologised for
taking. My mistake. Instead of the orig-
inal typescript, carbon copies were sent to
the U.S.A. It is false economy to have
carbon copies at all, but if they must be used
send them to England and the originals to
the U.S.A. American editors never like to
be reminded that they are only getting part
of the rights in anything.
As for subject-matter the demand is dif-
ferent in England and America, yet curi-
ously similar. In England you must have
an Englishman for the principal character
in your story, in the United States an
American. “The chief fault with your
stuff,” more than one editor has said to me,
“is that you don’t make the nationality of
your characters sufficiently clear. We don’t
mind you writing of Australia, or the South
Seas, or any old place so long as you begin
ia England and finish up here,”
The demand is understandable, I suppose.
There is no novelty in the Australian having-
adventures. He is a remote, incredible per-
son, and wild adventures are congruous with
his daily life. The necessary incongruity,
the thing that really provides the thrill, is
the Finsbury clerk with his back to the
bamboo wall, facing a crowd of niggers from
behind an automatic Colt. And when he
comes back to the normal again, to the sub-
urban home and the tailored suit, the reader
is left with the impression that life is indeed
wonderful and full of mystery.
And in America? Well, the instinct is
to keep the Western States as a national
reserve for the writers of adventure stories
and to prevent them from sti’aying further
afield. I don’t remember having seen, either
in Arizona or New Mexico, a man wearing-
chaps and a Colt, but they do it with con-
vincing effect on all the ten-cent magazine
covers. At El Paso, on the Mexican border,
I have been at a cowboy convention where
the vista of white linen was amazing, and
a man could hear his watch tick in the main
street long before midnight. But Columbus
Avenue doesn’t like to believe that at, all.
An instance in point. Paul Reynolds, the
doyen of New York agents, told me of a
brilliant young client of his, domiciled in
Texas, whose aim was to write just a few
stories of the life about him that he could
show to his neighbors without blushing. The
magazine editors, how 7 ever, wouldn’t have
them at any price. They made him keep
right on in the straight path, and so when
his usual, romantic stories appeared he had
to continue buying up all the copies of each
issue in the town.
The strongest demand in the U.S.A. is for
humor; and even in this taste changes. A
few years ago O. Henry was thq ideal, but
his superficial mannerisms were easy to copy,
and swarms of imitators followed in his
tracks. Just now the impulse of this un-
humorous people is toward slight, sketchy
stories built round a whimsical character.
Read “Stradivarius and the Food of Love”
in the • May number of Everybody’s. A
friend of mine on the staff assures, me that
this is the kind of stuff that editors, are
breaking their necks to get, and are willing
to sign cheques for at the rate of 50 dollars
a thousand, and upward.
And where does the war come in? In
London it has had the effect of killing off
the little independent magazines and papers
or bringing them under the control of big
firms like Hulton’s, Cassell’s or the Amalga-
mated Press. It is death to the detached
writer, or the writer with something indivi-
dual about him; it is a little favorable, per-
haps, to the hack writer who supplies his
contract stories and is eager to increase his
number per month. With the daily papers
it is the same: the outsider is wanted less
and less. The inoffensive, middle-aged
people who used to inhabit the British
Museum in order to find out queer things
about Persia have vanished like ghosts at
cock-crow. And three months ago my agent
told me that out of the manuscripts he' was
selling, books, serials and short stories, nine
out of ten were designed for the solace of
bereaved old ladies.
In New York the market has reverted to
the normal, and one must not mention the
war, on pain of rejection slips. A year ago
when there seemed a possibility that the
United States might reluctantly take its dis-
used sword down from above the mantel-
piece no editor would invest five cents in
fiction. There were old stocks to be used
and a torrent of patriotic fervor to be pre-
pared for, and manuscripts were returned by
next post. For it is to the credit of Ameri-
can editors that the majority of them pay
on acceptance, and never keep a supply of
stuff in bond. The queer creature in Fleet-
street, who used to pay 10s. cash to authors
in exchange for the prospective pound they
were getting for an accepted article, has no
counterpart on Broadway. I have heard
some London editors defend the payment-on-
publication system very strenuously. In-
security keeps the most intractable writer
as tame as a brumby in fly-time, and pre-
vents him from putting up his prices. And
there was one editor, the person who runs
The Book Monthly, who kept an article
of mine on Australian Writers for four
years and then sent a guinea in payment!
So much for the trade. Most men, I
suppose, who follow it pertinaciously flatter
themselves that they do so in order to
achieve Leisure for Literature. And it is an
easier occupation than breaking stones, what-
ever the sentimentalists say. But as far as
literature is concerned, one gets no nearer to
it by going to London. The people writing
it there are mostly receiving public money,
from Conrad downwards. In the majority of
cases the papers that want real writing
haven’t got the money to pay for it. The
stories in The World of lien were nearly all
printed in journals of literary repute—and
the payment for the lot would hardly have
bought a second-hand typewriter. For the
man who writes only what he wants to
write Fleet-street is quite as thorny as
George-street. I have known most of the
men who have had literary (as distinct from
commercial) successes in the last few years
and flattered themselves that they were
Simon Pures. They were nearly all living
on borrowed money, or reviews for The
Bookman at 15s. a thousand.
The place for the man who wants to in-
terpret the life of Australia is—well, any-
where between Cape York and the Leeuwin.
The Australians are the only people inter-
ested in the intimate actualities of Aus-
tralian life, (and even their interest is some-
what doubtful). And here I have a sugges-
tion which I cheerfully present to the people
responsible for arranging literary pensions in
Australia. All round our coast there are
lighthouses which have to be maintained, and
the emoluments to the keepers average some-
thing like £3OO per annum. It is sheer tor-
ture to keep a healthy man inactive in these
places, and, moreover, it is a shameful eco-
nomic waste. But the writer! His chief
needs are' security and isolation; leisure to
carry on his work undisturbed by contact
with his critics or the importunity of his
creditors. A little rearrangement, and we
might create that literature of which we all
dream.
London and New York call, though—-to
those who have not conquered a hankering
after the fleshpots. In both places, but
especially in Now York, there is plenty of
room for the clever purveyor of fiction, and
a man who is quick to profit by the experi-
ence of others will not be in much danger of
cutting his fingers. By the time he has come
to finding Punch amusing or to appreciat-
ing the flavor of mint-julep he will probably
have forgotten enough about Australian life
to write about it with pecuniary success.
Literature, however, isn’t quite so inter-
national. Writing about one’s own country
for the public of another is “colonialism,”
and most of the men who have anything
worth writing about have grown out of that
-stage... .But that is what I began saying in
Steele Rudd’s Magazine a dozen years ago.

DIAMONDS Reduced
ENORMOUSLY^.
Four years ago we took on a Sole Agency
calling for an enormous output of Diamonds,
and with a view to making the turnover we
offered them at merely a broker’s commission
on the Antwerp cutters’ cost.
The first year it did not do well; the second
year the sales were so great it did better; and
the third year better still, and so we are
continuing the experiment further-
We only stock the best grades of Dia-
monds ; but our prices for these are THE
LOWEST.
There is no duty on Diamonds.
We are the Sole Agents for one of the
largest cutters of Antwerp and Amsterdam.

A returned Soldier told us the other day that the
Colonel’s watch and his were the only two that stood
up against the hard wear of the trenches and the
intense vibration of the guns at Gallipoli. His watch
was in a steel case, and a mass of rust, and we
offered him a new silver one for it, but he would
not part with it.
In the African War we had a number of such
experiences.
WHY ?
Well! every excellence that effort and brains and
horological science can put into a watch has been
put into our celebrated “Fx & R ” watch, resulting
in an absolutely dependable watch of profound
accuracy, and yet low in price.

Xmas Time is
Drinking Time
and therefore presents a golden opportunity for wide-awake Fountain Drinks sellers to enjoy a
busy, profitable time.
But what of the drinks you serve? Will they invite the casual passers in again or send
them along to your competitor? You must guard against this.
You’ll find the public will be more particular than ever about the quality and flavor of their
drinks this season—tastes develop, and if you don’t satisfy them someone else will.
The Nelson “Iceless Interior” Fountain
is essential to make Best Drinks. That has been publicly demonstrated over and over again.
A further proof is that so many are getting rid of their fountains of inferior makes and installing
NELSON’S. (It takes us all our time to supply the demand.) These folk are wise; they
have hit the point of “supreme importance.” You can enjoy the success they arc having by
installing right away. It’ll pay you to look into the matter —NOW!
Nelson’s Fresh Fruit Juices
are Correct for Quality. They are extracted from choice, rich, ripe fruits and retain to the
Full that luscious, pleasing flavor which has made them so popular. To serve drinks that will
make good friends of your patrons it must be— “NELSON’S Concentrated.” (let a
stock in and prove the results for yourself.
We carry an especially large stock of reliable Fountain Supplies. Go through your stock
and send along your order early—little or much, you will be sure of immediate delivery.

I' HAVE for thirty-seven years declared war on all Scalp Diseases and Hair
Troubles. I bate the sight of Baldness, and have spared no expense in
putting together preparations all-powerful in their effect to remove those
enemies to one’s good appearance. Nature never intended man to have a bald
head.
It is unnatural and unsightly, and, therefore, ought to be removed. If
my instructions were carried out Baldness would be prevented in the rising
generation, and heads which are now partially bald could be covered with
an improved growth of hair. When we see how necessary hair is to a person’s
good appearance, one is surprised that its treatment should be placed in the
hands of impostors and charlatans who derive an excellent trade by the sale of
worthless and often injurious compounds, for which they claim impossible
merits and charge extravagant prices.
Tf you have any Scalp Disease or Hair ’Trouble you can consult me with
the knowledge that every word spoken and preparation sold carries with them a
guarantee that they are the result of a life’s study of Scalp and Hair Diseases,
and what is necessary to remove them. I have been thirty-one years following
my profession in the-heart of Australia. That ought to give you confidence in
consulting me if there is anything wrong with your scalp and hair.
Gentlemen with dry, irritating scalps, who are losing their hair, .should use
Parasene at night and Cosmo in the morning, and wash the head once a week with
Shampuna. Price: Two months’ treatment —Victoria, 12/-; four months, 23/-.
Other States, 12/6 and 23/6.
Ladies for the same trouble should use Restorer and Cosmo, and wash the hair as
often as necessary with Shampuna. Price as above. d -----
NATURALINE, for Grey Hair, Beard and Moustache.
Naturaline is a splendid preparation. It acts quickly, naturally and effectively,
and is perfectly harmless. Made in all colors. Get the right strength.
No 1 for light brown hair, medium for medium brown hair, No. 2 JV>r dark brown or
light black, and extra strong for very black hair. Price, by'post: "Victoria, 6/ 3;'
Other States, 6/8.
READ THESE REMARKABLE TESTIMONIALS.
Doctor at Hawthorn says: “If there is anything in the world that will
make your hair grow, Mr. Holland’s preparations will. I have seen their
effect for many years, and know them to be of the most genuine character.”
Doctor at Inglewood says: “Please send me the usual half-dozen bottles
of Parasene. ' It suits my scalp and hair better than any other preparation
I have ever used.”
Doctor at Malvern says: “Youv treatment has done wonders for my
brother’s scalp and hair. The bald patches have all gone, and his hair is
quite thick again.”
Doctor in Collins Street, Melbourne, says: “I was surprised to find
Miss P.’s trouble (Alopecia Areata) yield to your treatment so quickly.
Some of the patches had not grown any hair for more than seven years.
The disease has been quite cured, and the hair has grown -splendidly on all
the patches.”
Doctor at St. Ivilda says: “I have had Alopecia Areata for over two
years. As it will not yield to my treatment I have come to you. We
know you have studied these diseases for many years; that is why I have
confidence in placing myself under your treatment.” His * confidehce has
been more than justified, as the disease has yielded readily to my treatment.
Mrs. G., Hawthorn, nearly the whole of one side of her head bare;
•cured in a few months. Miss S., Kew, bald patches for six years; cured in
seven months. Mrs. W., Sale, wore a wig for many years; twelve months’
treatment produced a splendid growth of hair.
Father R. says: “Please send me Parasene and Exemo. I cannot speak
too highly of your excellent hair restorer. It is the only genuine stuff on the
market. As I have tried nearly all others I think 1 am competent to pass
judgment. The Shampuna.is also a splendid wash.”
Gentleman writes from Bendigo : “My hair is growing splendidly with
your treatment. It is marvellous how your preparations cure diseases of the
scalp. I know mine was in a dreadful state, but now the trouble is nearly
gone, and the hair is growing on the bald parts.”
These testimonials could be multiplied a thousandfold, but I think they
are sufficient to convince you of the fact that if you have any scalp disease
or hair trouble you cannot do better than consult me !

WANTED—A RELIGION FOR
AUSTRALIA.
Nebuchadnezzar, Emperor of the East, set
up an image on the plains of Babylon, and,
to the accompaniments of music and fiery
furnaces, called upon men of all nations and
creeds to get down on their marrow-bones and
put in a spell of solid worship before the
brazen god. This was a policy-move of
some significance. The Babylonian plan of
taking nations away bodily from their home-
lands and planting them in the suburbs of
the overgrown city by the Euphrates had its
disadvantages. Although it guaranteed a
supply of cheap labor sufficient even for the
needs of the most ambitious of all sky-scrap-
ing architects, the fact that 50 different
peoples, speaking strange tongues and wor-
shipping strange gods, were concentrated in
an area equal to that of a lower Darling
sheep-station, did not make for public
security. At any moment two or three of the
enslaved nations might combine in a danger-
ous revolt, and to guard against this it was
necessary to keep a large army mobilised.
Nebuchadnezzar saw that in making his
god, Bel-Merodacii, an object of general wor-
ship lay the best chance of keeping the
peace of the city, and cutting down military
expenditure. To what extent the fiery
furnace succeeded in the conversion of the
multitude we have no means of knowing, but
there was nothing unstatesmanlike about the
scheme ; for one of the first requirements of
a people is a national religion—a religion
strong enough in its grip and universal
enough in its sway to make its interest para-
mount over the thousand and one conflicting
notions and local'jealousies which tend to
divide and disintegrate. Such a religion is
one of Australia's national needs. We have
our religions—-a gross of them, more or less
—and some have elements of vitality, while
others are merely noisy and grotesque; but
not one among them seems to fill the whole
bill or to give the least promise that it ever
will or can fire the heart and imagination
and purpose of Australia as a nation.*
Religion, in its first meaning, is that which
binds fast, ties strongly as with leathern
thoßgs. The ancient Roman makers of the
word knew exactly the value of the worship
of those gods of hearth and home which bound
Latin and Sabine, plebeian and patrician,
to the city of the Seven Hills. It was the
cementing force of the composite nation, the
thing that kept it together in peace and
war, the thing without which an army
became a rabble and the community a loose
agglomeration of discordant factions. What
Nebuchadnezzar tried for Rome attained
iu the early infancy of the State, and in
the strength of the idea grew up that stern
patriotism which conquered the world. By
the binding grip of a united religious en-
thusiasm Persia rose to power; held together
by a similar subtle influence Egypt was still
collecting taxes from the puddlers of the
Nile mud when all her early con-
temporaries were deader than the camel on
which the lirst Pharaoh carried his square-
ended whiskers. The Jews, in spite of
the annoyance caused by their acquisitive
habits, hung together through their zeal for
a common worship, and were hanged together
when they and it had outlived their place,
their city and their national indepexidence.
Religious unity, backed by the Inquisition,
was the motive power of Spanish aggression
iu the New World ; and so wonderful is the
“bond of a belief differing from all others
that Islamism enabled the slack-trousered,
slouching western Asiatics to become all but
masters of the world. Apart altogether
from the nature of the religions themselves,
and without considering the extent to which
their tenets have been followed or ignored
by those who professed them, the general
fact remains that the nations with the tie
of a uniform belief have nearly always been
able to wallop to a finish those who were
bound together by slighter political bonds.
Australia, as a new country, wants a
national religion which shall be peculiarly her
own. An examination goes to show that beliefs
are largely territorial and racial. Where the
beautiful, cultured, allegorical paganism of
Greece, Rome and the Celtic lands once held
sway, the Roman Catholic Church, with its
decent; and well-established claim to be the
Mother of Saints and Nurse of the Arts, per-
petuates the traditions that were linked
with thoughts of the Olympians. Where
Tiior and Odin ruled in the darker, sterner
north, Protestantism, with its blank nega-
tions and furious war of words, has but
softened the primitive Gothic beliefs to about
the extent that Celtic and Latin blood lias
been infused into the veins of the people.
Presbyterianism is another name for oatmeal
and Lowland Scottish race; Catholicism is
another term for the warm, soft imagination
of Italy and Spain. Where, as in the High-
lands of Scotland and in Wales and Corn-
wall, Protestanism overlaps into the territory
of the Celt, which is the rightful heritage of
Catholicism, it is a kind of Protestanism
which can scarcely recognise itself —full of
color and strange emotional fervor, and with
a positive note which marks it as something
utterly distinct from the uncompromising
Nonconformity of the English midlands or
the rigid Lutheranism of Prussia. In a
general way it may be said that the peoples
of the world change the names of their reli-
gions once in a while, but the essence of
their faith remains the same through all
changes. The, Vestal Virgin has become a
Sister of Mercy; Brigid. the goddess, has
become Saint Bridget of Kildare; the priest
of Jupiter is a Dominican; and Thor’s
hammer has been smelted down to make the
Nonconformist conscience; but essentially
through all there runs the same spirit as of
old. Australia, a. new territory inhabited
by a pew race, which is a fusion of many
oid rhees, needs a new religion, differing
from the old, though perhaps with rays
of all in the spectrum that makes the pure
light which is to guide her* steps.
Poking about in the rubbish-heaps of time
we come across many scraps of broken creeds
and fragments of decayed beliefs which are
interesting; and here and there is an old
religious device so perfect in spite of tarnish
and rust that we almost fancy it could be
taken out and cleaned and made to work
again. There is, for instance, the sun-wor-
ship which we associate with the Persian,
though in reality it seems to have
been very widespread, and to have once
moulded the thoughts of men in countries as
wide ..apart as India, Donegal and Peru.
Australia has good 1 reason to venerate the
sun—the clean, white sun that calls, men
and women and little children out of doors
where-the thoughts are good and the great-
ness of- the world fills them with the joy of
living. It would be easy to worship this
god if it were not for Astronomy; but the
telescope is fatal to* the mystery of the old
creed, and Zoroaster, its prophet, is very
dead. Again, there is that bright gentle-
man among the rather shady Olympians,
Phcebus Apollo, who seems worthy of
attention. Standing, as he does, for light,
beauty, speed, music and art, for all the
higher culture of mind and body, we could
easily agree to the setting-up of his shrine
where his statue now stands in the public
gardens, and some of us might even go the
length of sacrificing two geese on his altar.
But in our hea v rts we feel that Apollo is
only a bright dream, and that there could
be no kick in his restored worship. Still
more attractive than any of these is Chris-
tianity—not the Christianity of a Church or
of any of the Chufches, but the simple social-
ism based on complete self-sacrifice which
was really taught by the Man of Nazareth.
His is a creed so sweet, so sad, so. full of
infinite; possibilities .and divine despairs, that
on quipt summer evenings, when our debts
are paid and our dinner has been good, we
could take it and hug it to our hearts as the
one possible thing amid all the shreds and
wreckage of the past. But let one come
through the sunset haze and smite us on the
cheek hard and well, and, lo! at the kiss
of the blow our Christianity has gone, and
instead of turning the other cheek we are
reaching for the siniter with a full hand of
clenched paganism. Because consciences
were clear and food well digested, primitive
Christianity made many converts; but
because its insistence upon the utter ab-
negation of all human instincts and desires
put the creed itself out of court in a world of
practical struggle and effort, those converts
when associated in societies and churches
soon altered the essence of the faith and
destroyed its vitality. There is not one
important feature of Australia’s national
policy which is not up against that primitive
creed as it stands in the Sermon on the
Mount, and the same may be said of the-aims
and aspirations of every nation of men which
is loosely called Christian.
* * * *
The folly of trying to revive the outward
forms of dead religions was sufficiently shown
by the attempts of Julian the Apostate
to build again the broken altars of the elder
gods. The thing would not work. Zeus
had been counted out; Apollo had had the
decision given against him ; Athene was of
less account than the washerlady who
soaped the Emperor’s shirt. As far as Aus-
tralia is concerned the old creeds are quite
dead. They have a few thousands of real
followers here and there, and the majority
who in practice reject their tenets make
some sort of belated acknowledgment of them
on census papers; but nobody with eyes to
see could describe Australia as possessing
any religion. We have reached the position
that the old creeds are gone and if this
continent is to have a common religious bond
it must be one which springs into existence
here, and which is at once in tune with the
temper and character of the people. It
need have none of the qualities of the older
faiths, or it may gather up the spirit and
essence of them all; it may do without ritual
and set seasons and robes and emblems, or
it may work out all the artistic possibilities
of gorgeous display ; it may have its priests
and high-priests, or delegate the job of
pastoral oversight to the Defence Depart-
ment or the police. It may chant its holy
hymns, or whistle ditties no more soulful in
seeming than “Tipperary”; it may have.its
heavens and hells and saints and sacraments,
or narrow itself down to the simplest for-
mula. In short, it may do anything or
nothing, so long as it is alive and gets itself
accepted as a living fact. The most sur-
prisingly successful of all religions was that
of Mahomet, and its triumph was mainly
due to the brevity of its creed —“There is
but one God and Mahomet is llis prophet.”
With as short a watchword as that Aus-
tralia might go ahead on i,ts road of faith,
and become as intense in its religious zeal
as the most ardent dollar-worshipper in the
golden shrines of Wall-street.
* * *
But the chances are that the new Aus-
tralian religion calls for a prophet and per-
haps a martyr or two, and these people are
not yet in sight. It may be that somewhere
among our hills and valleys the living spirits
of this land of sun and promise wait only
our earnest call to show themselves in their
white beauty, fairer than the men and
women of the household of Jove. It may be
that in the stress of the days to be, when our
backs are at the wall and the foe rages like
a debt-collector on the front doormat, the
great inspiration will come to us and the
worship of an undivided white continent,
sealed with the sacrifice of our best blood,
fill our souls to the exclusion of all meaner
things. It may be that the Socialistic Tiger,
clawing down the shrines of the Fat, will
roar a new creed of brotherhood that will be
as the voice of an awakened god. It may be
that a Great One will arise among us, a
plain politician with a clean, large mind and
a clear, persuasive voice, who will draw the
nation after him as one man.into the wider
places of sane endeavor and unfaltering pur-
pose, and that, clothed with his spirit, Aus-
tralia will have all the religion she needs.
It may be that, like the old Scriptural per-
son, ive shall remain in the backwash of
time as an ass halting between the burdens
of ineptitude and desire, until we are borne
down into the dust of nothingness by the
steady commercial tramp of our own mutton.
To such a people in such 3 land anything is
possible. We need a religion, but until we
get it we must put up with what we have,
and meanwhile strive for the next best thing
—a straightforward and honest national
policy.
“Billabong”: A navigation problem quite
out of the ordinary confronted an Australian
named Drew a few weeks back. He is mana-
ger of the Gem Navigation Co., which owns
a fleet of vessels on the Murray. In July
heavy rain fell at and about Gunnedah, on
the Namoi, about 1000 miles from Went-
worth, where the Darling joins the Murray.
Along the Darling the stations had just cut
out, and large quantities of wool were await-
ing an reach market. A big
fresh was reported running from Walgett to
Wentworth via Bourke, Wilcannia and
Menindie. When the swell reached Went-
worth the Gem fleet was all ready loaded
with back freight for the stations. A par-
ticularly nice problem was how far up the
barges could go before having to turn to run
back on the wave, and so avoid being-
stranded behind it. Every mile further along
was so much more profits, yet if the safety-
line was exceeded the whole lot went up in
spray. The difficulty was' to gauge how long
the water would be travelling from Gunne-
dah to Wentworth, how deep it would be,
olid how long the rise would last; but it was
successfully tackled, and on the surplus
water from the far away rainstorm the wool
clips of a score of stations along the Dar-
ling were safely borne to the Murray. Thence
to the seaboard was easy.
“Severn” : Bushimaiwa was the last great
chief of Papua. So tremendous was he that
when he passed through a village street the
natives dumped their noses in the dust and
squirmed. There was too much man-eating
going on in Bushi’s domains, so Sir George
Le Hnnte. then Governor, went to see about
if. A mighty man was Sir George, some
inches over Oft.; and he strode impressively
towards the old man, who sat in state sur-
rounded by his staff. The representative of
British majesty bowed;- whereupon Bushi-
maiwa turned to his interpreter and spoke
in lordly condescension: “Tell the white
chief that the great chief permits him to sit
down !” Some years later cannibalism became
so rife that something had to be done, and
Bushimaiwa was invited to Samarai gaol.
He said he really didn’t mind being the
guest of the Government—provided he might
take at least six of his staff with him. A
few weeks later he escaped with his staff.
He ate them on the way home. Then we
knew why he had been so anxious to have
part of his staff with him. He was merely
providing tucker for the return journey.
Bushimaiwa had Iff) wives, and kept them all
iu order. But the job killed him in the end.
“Snell”: “Yawn” Murray, Chief Sec. ot
Vic., claims, I see, to know as much abou'
the Australian blacks as any man living. He
holds the one thing for them is work —and
they like work if well handled, says he. Per-
haps; but I could recall many proofs to the
contrary. Here’s Teddy, of Burrumbeet.
who haunted Waddy when 1 was a boy. One
day a boss drover stirred Teddy up with his
toe on the common, and said: "You mind it
sheep three day, mine gib it 15 bob.” The
sheep were spread on the common. . Teddy
raised himself on his elbow. “Tiffateen
tshilla!” he-said. “My wort!” The drover
went on, and returned in three days. Teddy
was still asleep on the common; the sheet)
were God-knows-where. Again the drover
stirred Teddy up. “Mine looseiu job,” said
the faithful black. "But, you nice, dear,
black darling” [or words to the same effect],
“why did you let the sheep go?” wailed the
drover. Teddy shook his head forlornly.
“No good mine call 'em,” lie said. “You
forgot it tell me name belonga those sheep.
"Billybunger”: The shallowest artesian
water in the world is possibly on Manfred
Downs station (N.Q.). On one portion of
the run they have an inch pipe sunk in the
ground to a depth of eight feet, and this
gives a flowing supply. Scattered over Man-
fred country are mud-springs which are
nothing more than artesian outcrops. Simi-
lar ones are common through the Gull coun-
trv. Rockwcod station, also in North Queens-
land, had a very different experience. The
contract for a bore was let, and jifter a
couple of years’ fruitless work the contractor
went broke. The station took the plffcnt over
and continued for another couple of years.
At this stage the borer was all for abandon-
ing the hole as a hopeless proposition. But
“Cocky” Stewart, part owner and manager
of Rock wood, was determined to, as he put
it, “strike fire or water.” After six years’
plugging a small flow was struck at well
over 4000 feet. The peculiar thing
about it was that whenever a match was
applied to the borehead escaping gas would
spring aflame. So Stewart got fire and water.

Apart from the natural advantages of
Jervis Bay as a site for the Australian
Naval College, there seems a peculiar fitness
in the selection of the place since it was
discovered and named by one who first sug-
gested the wisdom of
training young naval officers in seamanship on the
coast here, so that they might obtain geographical
and hydrographical knowledge of this part of the
world, which might eventually prove of much service
to the Colony.
Thus Richard Bowen wrote in 1791. The
discoverer of the bay was one of four
brothers, all distinguished iu the naval ser-
vice. This one in 1790 was a lieutenant in
the Prince, under Sir John Jervis. In 1791
he came to N. S. Wales, in charge of a
transport, and discovered and named Jervis
Bay after his patron. In ’93 he took Gov-
ernor Phillip back to England, rejoined Ad-
miral Jervis, aiid did heaps of fight-
ing. In ’94 he became post-captain of the
Terpsichore, and in that vessel had some
historical victories, and finally, as the naval
annals say, “met a glorious death” in the
attack on Santa Cruz on July -4. 1797.
him Nelson wrote in his despatches: "A
more enterprising, able and gallant officer
does not grace his Majesty’s Naval Service.
The memories gathered round the Nava.
College site will be used by some historian
t j some day adorn a longer tale than this.

“McNortli’G, In a long experience amongst
native races I have come across many dances
and many dancers. In Papua I have formed
one of the audience at the uproarious
shivoos of the natives of the Purari River,
where the naked, painted savages had only
30 square yards of dry ground to caper on,
the rest being slimy mud. I have witnessed
the swaying, sensuous, waltz-like sets of the
Hanuabadas, and the gruesome yet graceful
curvetings of the cannibals of Malaita,
usually performed on peaceful moonlit nights,
with the calm, silvery sea showing here and
there between the fronds of the waving,
rustling cocoanut palms. Even here, _ on
Cape York, as I write,' comes the impressive,
rhythmical beat of a tom-tom announcing
the preliminary of a death-wail. Binghi
dances just as dutifully over a death as he
does to celebrate the capture of a kangaroo.
But in point of strenuousness and agility
none of these corroborees is in it with a
representation of a gohanna fight I saw
danced recently by the niggers of Croker
Island (N.T.3. There was no mopn, and a
large circle of fires, tended by the non-per-
formers, only seemed to accentuate the dark-
ness. Thirty or 40 naked blacks, their
bodies smeared with colored earths, occupied
the inside of the ring. The name part was
plaved by two powerful men who had evi-
dently been selected for their agility. Then
the music—which was supplied by a hoary
old reprobate blowing .through a long bam-
boo, producing a short, drum-like note —
began, and the gohannas got to work. Each
assumed a kneeling position facing the other,
with his tongue out in, imitation of a ’go. in
a temper. Then with their hands above their
Swag and Saddle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, some may go by railway train
And some may go by car,
And they'll be there and back again
Ere I’ve gone very far.
But I will choose an easy track
And in the shade I’ll paddle,
While pistons wheeze and axles crack,
With my old swag and saddle.
They miss Life’s best who travel fast,
For Speed is no man’s friend;
lied fiends shriek in the whistle blast
As you reel round the bend ;
You get a smile —a hand-wave gay,
As hotly you skedaddle p
I find a friend for many a day
Who jog with swag and saddle.

heads, and with two fingers of each hand
sticking straight up to represent claws, they
charged at full speed. They missed one
another by a narrow margin, wheeled and
charged again and again. Sometimes one
would execute a flanking movement, but the
enemy was generally too quick. All this
was performed in a kneeling position in soft
loose sand. During these manoeuvres the
rest of the dancers were jumping around the
two principals, chanting a melody which
seemed to consist of three words and two
notes. Occasionally they would burst into
a roar like the yell of a mob of football bar-
rackers. As far as I could gather the fight
ended in a draw. It was necessary to de-
clare peace, anyway, as the ochre on the
dancers’ faces became mingled with perspira-
tion and formed a dough-like mixture which
caked over the eyes and obstructed the sight.
The performance was; a remarkable exhibi-
tion of agility, and a most realistic piece of
mimicry, performed, by the way, 160 miles
from the nearest white-man settlement.

“Kinso”: A publican in a town on the
Western slopes (N.S.W.), an inveterate
joker, got the local plumber to make him a
huge tin mug about 12in. high, with a false
botjtom about 2jin. down. It was his delight
to ask some practised old beer-sparrer in for
a drink, and hand him the enormous vessel
with the froth flowing over the top. The
ecstatic joy of the beer-bummer on receiving
it, and his dreadful wrath when the machine
prematurely ran dry, used to provide much
amusement. One, day the publican invited
an ancient derelict in and handed the
drinking fountain to a new barman to fill.
When the dissipated ruin received it, he
heaved a sigh of joy. and drank steadily for
about 10 minutes. Then he set it down, and
said : “The best long beer I ever had —now,
that’s something like a pint.” After which he
pushed himself out, and went to sleep on
the bench. Later on the publican, when
polishing the goblet, found that the false
bottom had been perforated with a knife.
The ancient derelict had surreptitiously made
his preparations earlier in the day.

“John York” : A little-known collection of
ruins which marks one of the early attempts
at the settlement of Northern Australia is
the old town of Victoria. Port Essington.
120 miles from Darwin. The settlement was
started in 1838 pn the shores of a bay in one
of the deepest and most extensive harbors in
Australia. Gently undulating country, tim-
bered with jungle and open forest, extends
along the shores, to the white beaches. Here
and there a redjand-white cliff juts into the
sapphire water. The site of the old settle-
ment is an almost-level tableland, high above
the harbor and overlooking it. The old-
timers who selected it certainly had eyes
for the beautiful. It is like being in fairy-
land to stand on the ruins of one of the gun-
emplacements and look down through the
timber at the brilliant sunlight changing the
bay to all the colors of the prism, and back
again to the exquisite blue of tropic seas.
The ruins consist mainly of the stone and
brick buildings used by the military. The
bricks were made on the spot, and are well
preserved. Rows of chimneys indicate w r hat
were once streets, and the remains of a jetty
project into the sea at the foot of the road
which leads from the relics of the fort. I
visited this old Victoria recently, and saw
that, just previously, Binghi, wanting hark
for a humpy, had stripped some trees which
were growing between the roofless walls of
what, 75 years ago, had been the dining-
room of Government House. llow nature
gets back her own! In a quiet little hollow,
a quarter of a mile from the town, lie the
bones of those high-spirited adventurers who
gave their lives in this attempt at the white
settlement of a wild and savage country,
fheir graves are overgrown with weeds and
jungle, and their deeds are forgotten. But
their names are more or less perpetuated by
the inscriptions on the tombstones. As all
were becoming undecipherable, the N.T.
Administration, a couple of years ago,
had them reinscribed. The writer doesn’t
know who is responsible for the way in
which the work was carried out. He just
quotes the following as fair samples of the

“Billy Blue” : This is how they built the
Church of England branch store on the
Sofala (N.S.W.) goldfield, in 1851. On
Saturday, November ,8, the miners, at a
meeting over which Bishop Broughton pre-
sided, determined to deliver the goods. All
hands turned to, and a frame was run up
and covered with canvas. Next day two
services were held. The plate washed up at
£lB in cash, numerous small nuggets and a
ARTLESS.
“ Please , Mister, get us our kite.”
quantity of fine gold. During the following
week the work of erecting a permanent
church went on, and on Sunday, November
10, the job was finished. The place was over-
crowded at the morning service, and at its
conclusion all went outside except the Bishop,
who in his vestments mounted a ladder,
climbed to the eastern gable, nailed a cross
to the ridgepole, dedicated the church and
delivered an address from his perch. lie
then descended, tolled the bell, and as many
as possible filed into the official opening ser-
vice. The strenuous week closed with a
subscription from the miners of £IBO.
“Kuku-Kuku”: “In all my travels through
the world,” said the famous Lady Mary Wort-
ley Montagu, “I have met with but two sorts
of people—men and- women.” There are men
and women in New Guinea. The native
beauties of Port Moresby and the neighbor-
ing country had, and have, admirers, and
they treat them in the way that women
do. The men give presents —dogs’ teeth,
betel-nut, arm-shells, tobacco, beautiful
costumes consisting of one yard and a half
of straight calico. The girls take them, and
suggest that they will show their gratitude
in good time. The men go on making pre-
sents. By-and-bye it dawns on them that
they are being “had,” so they try to get the
goods back. And the girl says she wants
them for souvenirs, and, anyhow, she never
thought they were meant as anything but
friendly little gifts, and, after all, they aren’t
worth sending back again. The men made
up a deputation to the Governor about it
some while ago. They asked him to bring
in a law preventing the girls from taking
their presents and laughing at them. They
said a wife was an expensive sort of thing to
buy, and they could not afford this monkey-
ing about, and would not the Government do
something to stop it? The Government said
in reply that it couldn’t, for the excellent
reason that its own white subjects went on
in just the same way, and nobody had ever
been able to stop them. And the girls
laughed, and went on doing it.
“ARCADY"
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Tis “Arcady” ! The name appears
Upop a fractured fanlight dim,
With spider-webs of other years
That greyly drape the dusty rim;
There is a scent within the hall
Of old, old onions stewed with tripe,
Of greasy garments on the wall,
Boiled cabbage, and a dirty pipe,
That gushes out to welcome me
To Arcady.
The nymph who answers to the bell
Is heavv-eyed and pasty-faced;
Strange angles in her figure tell
Of battered coisets half-unlaced ;
She brings a whiff of beds unaired
And dirty linen in her wake;
’Twould seem that she has never cared
A hot and soapy bath to take.
Nmyphs are not what they used to be
In Arcady !
The tattered carpet on the stairs,
Worn to a blur by heavy soles,
Is overlaid with fluff and hairs
And patterned lavishly with holes;
The doors droop, sadly at the hinge,
The dirty walls are thick with scribble,
And dish-rags clot the scummy fringe
About the tap’s incessant dribble ;
And blowflies have replaced the bee
In Arcady.
Above the sagging curtain shows
A notice writ with wobbly pen,
Arcadia’s final anguished throes —
“Rooms for respectable young men.’’
And I had dreamt of pleasures rare,
Of rustic joys in meadows fragrant,
Where never falls the shade of care
And Life may roam a happy vagrant;
And thought that Poets held the key
Of Arcady.
Alas ! alas ! all legends bow
To Time’s imperious marching orders.
Arcadia’s in the suburbs now,
Engaged in taking in stray boarders;
The prattling streams flow through the main,
The shady trees have fed the fire,
The aged lambs have all been slain,
And Condon has cabs for hire,
And Phyllis makes the hash for tea
In Arcady.

Shorty Gets the Gun.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM somewhere in the low range of
hills on our right front a gun had
been troubling a corner of our trench
for days. Our flier couldn’t spot it, and our
battery hadn’t knocked it out. At sun-up,
mid-day and sundown it fired its single
round, and so far had always got its man.
We joked about it, called it "Three-a-day”;
but we didn’t like it, and the Colonel was
hopping mad- and said it just had to be stop-
ped.
"By the Piper o’ Hell,” swore Shorty,
"I’ll never rest in my grave till I get it.”
That night Shorty and his mate, a cove
he’d been drovin’ with in Queensland, went
out unbeknown to get the gun. None of us
ever believed they had a hope.
At streak o’ day the Queenslander showed
up without Shorty. He was blood from head
to foot. His tunic was torn to ribbons, and
as he was zig-zagging along, about twenty
paces on the far side of the parapet, Three-
a-day said “Good mfornin’.”
We buried the bloke, what there was of
him, just where he fell.
During the day the Big Pots come up and
looked the place over. All the damage had
been done on a front of less than a hundred
yards. It fired a shell that burst in a cloud-
of stinking smoke which seemed to claw into
the ground rather than go off in the air. We
never got no bits of the projectile bigger
than a peanut, but what we did get one of
the coves who used to work at Lithgow said
w r as a sort of bronze. And we .always got
scraps of silver. I’ve got a bit stowed in my
pack now —half an inch wide and thicker ’n
half a dollar, and we worked it out that the
shell was about a three-incher, and bound
with silver.
High-grade ammunition. What do you
think ?
Our Battery-Commander, he’d knocked
about a bit, and he said the gun was an old-
time hoaryental weapon. He'd seen some of
them in the back country when he was build-
ing the Balkan railway, but he’d never seen
none of ’em fired, and he wouldn’t have fired
one himself for a thousand quid.
“What it is or isn’t don’t interest me
none,” snapped the Colonel. “What' I want
to get at is where it is.”
“Judging by the apparent angles of the
lines of fire,” said the Adjutant, who used
to be in the Lands Department, and had
been monkeying with a theodolite all the
morning—“judging by the apparent angles
of the lines of fire and the length of trench
contained in the danger zone, I would assume
that the gun is practically in a fixed posi-
tion.” Here he walked back ten yards and
HER EXPLANATION.
THE MAN ongrily): “ Here , it’s two o’clock,
and yon said you would he here at
twelve.”
THE GIRL: " Did I say twelve? I meant
one.”
had another squint through his jigger,
pointing to the hills as it were over there.
“I should say that the gun was”
He never said it.
Three-a-day spoke first, and we were
short of an adjutant and a theodolite just
out of the box. It was a bit over the odds.
We were still funny about it, but we were
funky—don’t you forget it. Some of us
had read “The Arabian Nights,” and most
of us had heard an’ seen queer things in
Egypt. There’d been corpses dead about
four thousand years grinning at us out of
painted boxes. We’d run races up the
Pyramids for five-piastre bets, and seen
niggers at the street corners in Cairo do
the AaronVrod act time and again, just
as you read it in the Bible. Yes, and we’d
smacked the. Sphinx on the flank as if she
was a slow milker. But you can bet your
boots a whole lot of it was kiddum. Any-
how, Tliree-a-day had got us guessing. And
the Colonel too.
“Why,” said he, “having got our range,
should they fire only one round ?”
It was a sensible question, but our Bat-
tery-Commander was waiting for him and
remarked that if it was one of them hoary-
ental weps. they’d probably have some
hanky-panky connected with it.
The Colonel was nonplushed.
‘Anyhow,” he come at him again, "is there
any truth m this report that they....they
attack only three times a day?”
This got me narked and I snapped me
wristlet watch open and held it under his
nose. The hands pointed to 12.25, and the
fatigue party was just flattening down the
last spadefuls of earth on top of our late
adjutant.
“Dammit,” he said, “something’s got to be
done.”
Of course it was up to him, which he knew
as well as we did. But what could he do?
Most of his field experience he'd picked up
iu Birthday reviews, and none of ’em’s a bit
like Gallipoli. .
The Sergeant-Major of C platoon was an
old Imperial man and had been through the
• mitral. lie give the captain the whisper,
and both of them stepped over to the old
man’s dugout. Late in the afternoon they
squinted at the lulls through their field-
glasses for the best part of an hour, and at
sundown we buried the captain’s orderly, a
chap from Gundagai named Briggs.
The Turkies’ trench was about a hundred
and fifty yards from ours, and its left rested
on the edge of a deep watercourse which
we’d found by observation come from the
hills where we reckoned they'd got the gun
posted. At dark, the Sergeant-Major, me and
a bloke named Arkins from Surry Hills slid
down a goat-track leading to the creek. We
were equipped proper. We each had two
dry rations, fifty rounds, a plug of dyna-
mite. a length of fuse and a small helio-
graphing mirror, me being in the signallers
and Arkins and the S.-M. knowing something
of the game; the idea being to run the
creek up into the hills, make for separate
observation points on the ridge, try and spot
the gun, if it took us all day, and tip off our
birdman, who was to be handy, to either
drop a bomb or direct the fire of the battery.
If we were lucky enough to get close up to
the thing we were to blow it to Hell; but
if there was nothing doing we were to pinch
back to the lines after dark.
When we got to the creek we bustled along,
as there was a hit of a moon iu a couple of
hours, and we wanted to be well past the
Turkies’ trenches before it rose. It was
heavy going. Boulders and stretches of sand
and every now and then the waterfall act
over a shelf of greasy rock. By the time
the moon was due we thought it time to
strike uphill, but the bank was as steep as
the side of a house. It w T as as black as the
Earl of ’Ell’s waistcoat down where we were,
though up top we could, see the stars aud
toward the east distinguish the trees agin the
skv. It was the moon coming up. The S.-M.
was in the lead and Arkins behind me, but
for all that I don't mind telling you it took
me all my time to crack hardy. I had the
feeling that there was more than just us
three on the job, but nothing certain. I could
have swore there was somebody marching
parallel with us,: but a bit higher up the
bank. Once I thought I spotted him, or his
shadow, duck between two trees. I stopped
dead and covered the place where I thought
he was. and Arkins bumped into me and
nearly knocked me tip-over-Charley. There
was no use getting on to Arkins; lie used
to be a dealer and the only bush lie knew was
Moore Park. But I was right. Next minute
I seen who it was. shorty! Walking along-
side the Sergeant-Major and showing him
the track.
I didn’t try to show him to Arkins, cause
he’s as blind as a bat. God knows how he
ever passed his eyesight!
I could see him right enough. Being a
man of sense I argued that Shorty had found
the gun and sent his mate the Queens-
lander back for help, them not being-
equipped proper, and the poor blighter got
blown out before he could make his chat.
Shorty had had a rough time, too. The top
part of his tunic was all over blood, and
he was gripping his pants like bis belt had
give way.
All of a suddqii we broke into a little
clearing and flopped in the thin scrub on
the edge. In front aud maybe .a chain
awav was an .putcrop of rock, and—
at about twice the; height of a man up it--a
cleft, and out of it poking the nose of a long,
slim gun all carved and modelled like the
cast-iron post of a terrace-house verandah.
Shorty and the Sergeant wriggled off to the
right, and in aboilt half an hour, though it
might have been lpss, back comes the S.-M..
grinning all over his dial, and collected, the
dynamite. He knew all about explosives,
having been a miner at Hill End when he
enlisted.
“Ain’t there no Turkies?” I asked him.
"We’ll have to chance that,” he whis-
pered. “You fill your magazines and be
ready to ho]) it when I give the office.” And
he ducked off.
In another while he was back, and we
were going L-for-leatlier down the hill,
Shorty and Arkins in front and the Ser-
geant-Major two paces in the rear.
Presently, when I was cracking my
ears to "hear the gun go up in the air.
Arkins comes a devil of a cropper, and
when we picks him up. hanged if he hadn’t
tripped over poor old Shorty!
Yes —dead as a door-nail and as stiff as a
poker: his throat cut from ear to there, his
belly ripped open and the ants crawling all
over him.
Just behind us a red flame shot a mile in
the air with a roar like thunder.
It was the gun. Shorty had got it.
So far as I know, he is resting quiet where
we planted him that night on the hillside in
Gallipoli.

The Cold Bird.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOUR breathless, steamy nights, with the
thermometer wavering like the needle
of a steam gauge in the neighborhood of
80°, had settled the Maorilander. I felt pretty
done up myself; but when I looked at him
lying back white and exhausted I was really
alarmed. There was a long iced drink on
the little round table before him, and the
electric fan overhead kept his dank hair
lifting; but with white eyelids piously mask-
ing his eyes he seemed to be merely conde-
scending to live.
The talkative, lonely man with the loud
voice threw a sudden remark at the barmaid.
It exploded like a bomb ip the hot silence.
“Hundred and eighteen at Bourke yester-
day !”
“Fan-cy!”
The lip of the recumbent Maorilander
curled. “Shut up, d —n you!” he groaned,
without, however, opening his eyes.
The stranger looked hard at the inter-
jector but did not say anything. It may have
been that the appropriate remark did not sug-
gest itself.
A COURSING MATCH IN TOPHET.
The powdered dust of a dry month floated
into the cool and shadowy bar where the
glass clinked and the tireless electric fans
droned and hummed dreamily. The hot
rattle and roar of the traffic desecrated the
calm within, and the glare of the afternoon
sun fell through the slats of the green blinds
in white spears of light.
“Yes, a hundred and eighteen at Bourke!”
And again the inane coo of the barmaid:
“Fan-cy!”
“Pretty hot that, eh?”
“I should think so!”
(Low moan from the Maorilander.)
“But I see that it was even hotter at a
place called Jerry’s Plains —a hundred and
twenty there!”
“You don’t say so!”
“Fact! Just saw it in the paper.” There
was a hot crackling of heat-brittled paper—
,a series of crashes and little explosions.
“There !”
“I’ll take your word for it.”
“ENGAGED.”
“No, but see for yourself!”
The girl rose from her chair as in duty
bound and advanced, sighing, to read the
unnecessary news.
“That’s right, isn’t hundred and
twenty!”
The Maorilander opened his eyes, looked
curiously at the talkative one, and swept the
hair back from his pallid forehead. “Where
can we go out of this? He’s got the habit
now. He can’t stop !”
We rose and went out of
the shadowy place of ice,
drinks and fans into the
white, quivering heat, and
without exchanging a word
climbed aboard the first
tram that slid up the street.
I think it occurred to me
that there would be some
relief in the draught of the
thing as it rushed along.
The Maorilander followed
my lead. We travelled
along, liatless and speech-
less, until the tram stopped
opposite the hot gates of the
gasping Zoo. Then it
occurred to me to get off, and
I did so. Again the Maori-
lander followed, apparently
because all his ideas had
fallen off him. I paid two
hot sixpences to a perspir-
ing, speechless turnstile man
who was on the verge of
sleep, and he allowed us to
clank through the iron bar-
rier he guarded. We passed
in.
All the animals were lying listlessly in
their shady enclosures, or resting hot snouts
on the doorsteps of their little houses. The
birds stared dully from their perches, or slept
with glazed eyes. The lion dozed with his
immense face turned expectantly to the south
where the “busters” come from. The Polar
bear splashed sluggishly in his cool and
massive concrete den. We stared enviously
through the bars and, perspiring a little
faster, passed on to less tantalising sights.
The exhausted Maorilander drifted along
without protest wherever I chose to go, lin-
gering when I lingered and saying no word.
He was like a man dead but not yet buried.
In this dreadful manner we made the whole
purposeless circuit of the place, staring dully
at the animals and being stared at dully in
return. The heat quivered and danced; not
a leaf stirred; time and the sun seemed to
be standing still and waiting.
We passed by the supercilious camel, in-
sanely upholstered and humped; the beauti-
ful but spindly gazelles and the spitting ani-
mal, until we came to the big bird section.
Then the something for which the whole
place seemed to be waiting happened. The
Maorilander emitted a curious sound that
was half-curse and half-sob. “Oh, the poor,
<l—d fool!” he wailed, and, falling forward,
clung with both hands to the top wires of a
fence, directly opposite the most sorrowful
and grotesque and superfluous bird the place
owns. It was indecently bald and ragged,
and its two long rickety legs knocked to-
gether at the knees and appeared to have
been recently whitewashed by an interfering
lunatic. These things might not have mat-
tered if it hadn’t shivered as it stood bald-
headed in the dreadful heat and with its
superannuated feet pmnted on the red-hot
sand of its shadeless, baking patch.
“Heavens! It's cold! The poor fool of a
thing’s cold! Didn’t you see it shiver?”
“Well, let it shiver if it wants to!” I
growled, and tried to drag him on to the
next absurdity.
He shook me off impatiently and stuck his
white face through the wires. “You poor old
cow!” he breathed, addressing the ruin. “Oh.
you poor old cow!”
The bird opened one bleared and wretched
eye, closed it and shivered again!
“There you are! It’s cold!! It’s cold,
do you hear! Cold! —on a day like this.
Why, it would be cold in Sheol!” He
breathed deeply four times through his nose,
then suddenly wheeled round on me. “Here !
why don’t they make a fire for it? Why
don’t they put the d—d thing in a hot-
house and give it blankets? If it’s cold
now what must it be in winter?” His
voice was pitched in an unnaturally high key
and there was a gleam in his eye I didn’t
like.
“Let’s get info the shade!” I urged.
“But the thing’s cold!” he screamed.
“It’s cold, d’ye hear! Cold! —on a day
like this !”
“We can’t help it. old man!”
“Yes, we can! We can help the d—d
thing by making a fire and kicking up a row
in the press until they build a hothouse or
a furnace for it and give it a supply of
blankets and hot rum—or shoot it! Why
can’t they make proper provision for it? If
they get things from Hades, why can’t
they”
“Oh, don’t be an ass! They didn’t
get”-
-—-“get things from Hades, they should
make proper provision for ’em!”
“Come away and have a cool drink!”
fumbled drunkenly in his pocket.
“What are you going to do?”
He didn't trouble to answer me. But
he thrust his head through the wires again
and addressed the blinking bird. “Buck up,
you poor old bloke! I’m going to make you
comfortable, if nobody else is.” He with-
drew his head and resumed fumbling.
“What do you want?”
“M atch e s ! Get
some wood. I’m goin’
to make fire for poor
dash bird!”
“Oh. don’t be a
fool!” I implored.
“We’ll get into trouble,
if you start . messing
about the animals.”
He shook his head
obstinately. “No, we
won’t!” Then once
more he addressed the
bird: “Cheer up, you
poor old brute. You’re
goin’ to be warm pres-
ently!” He produced
a newspaper from his
pocket, unfolded it,
and started to gather
leaves and twigs for
kindling.
I saw that his mind
was focussed on the
lire project, and that
the situation was one
for diplomacy, “Look
here, old man, sup-
pose we go along and
find the keeper first?”
He looked up from
his twig-gathering and
panted: “’Spose the
poor dam thing freezes
to death while we’re
away? Do you want
it to freeze to death?”
“It won’t freeze to
death.”
“How do you know
it won’t?”
“I’m certain it
won’t!’’
“Oh, are you ! Well,
I’m not!” He resumed
his fuel gathering. “I’m
not goin’ to leave the
poor devil to freeze.
Look at it! It’s shiv-
ering again!”
And so it was. It
looked as cold and
wretched as a naked
explorer might in an
Antarctic blizzard. It
seemed too mad to be
true; but there was
the grotesque thing do-
ing the utterly impos-
sible.
“The poor old
wretch !” mumbled the
comforter of the un-
necessary, and peered
round to see how he
could get over the
fence with least dan-
ger of spilling his
sticks.
Then I noticed one
of the keepers ambling
along, and drew the
Maorilander’s heated
attention. He waited
until the perspiring
man was abreast of
us, and then attacked
him furiously for the
inhumanity of the Zoo-
logical Society in leav-
ing the preposterous
bird without proper
comforts. “Why don’t
you keep the d —d
thing warm?” shouted
the Maorilander. “Why hasn’t it got
a hothouse and blankets. D’ye know that
that poor blighted thing is shivering even
to-day. D’ye know that?”
The keeper drew a deep breath and looked
hard at the Maorilander. “Yes, sir, I know
it’s shivering!”
“Well, why in Heaven's name don’t you
light a lire for it, or do something!”
"Because, sir, that bird shivers when it
feels hot!”
The keeper passed on triumphantly.
THE TROUBLE.
M RS. JONES: “I always think twice before I
speak."
MR. JONES : “ Exactly , Maria. But you are
such a deuced quick thinker.”
The Maorilander, with his arms full of
sticks, stared hard at his retreating back.
Then he dropped his sticks, clawed up a big
handful of sand and dashed it at the
absurdity.
The Cold Bird blinked again and shivered.
KODAK.


My Lady the Moon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sun is a gentleman brushed and fine
With his smart gold hair and his boots
a-shine.
As he walks on the arch of the circling sky
The lily maids and the rose girls sigh ;
But his pillows are piled in the shining west,
And the bats are out and the world has rest,
While up from her sea-bath sweet and soon
Rises my laughter lady, the moon.
Scents of the dusk and shine on the sea,
This is the hour when joy goes free!
Strain of melody low and far,
And a swaying bough and a peeping star!
Ruffle of lace around her throat,
And her hair as dark as the night’s own
coat —•
Oh, the small airs languish and sink and
swoon
For love of my dainty lady, the moon.
A kiss in the dusk is the price we pay
For a quickened heartbeat to make us gay,
And the pedlar moon has wares to sell,
And a tale of dimples and sighs to tell.
Oh, open your pack, bright lady, and show
Your ribbons and reels and your pins a-row !
Who’ll buy? Who’ll buy? For the night
goes soon
And she deals in haste, does my lady the
moon.
Powder of youth and sweets of dream,
And a trailing cloud and a haunted stream,
And a memory treasured and worn and old,
And a god’s white foot and an apple of gold,
And a rose to pluck, and a girl to woo,
And a fairy ring, and a jug of dew !
Come buy! Come buy ! For the night goes
soon,
And a cloud is chasing my lady the moon-
Nonsense beats at the gates of joy,
And Time himself is a bright-haired boy.
Run fast, run slow, be it praise or blame,
The white stars wink, and the goal's the
same;
But the fairies have tucked grey Truth in
bed
With a glow-worm poultice to soothe his
head,
And folly is wise to the old heart’s tune
In the train of our laughter lady, the moon.

Courtin’ Harriet.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“npALKIN’ of big floods,” said Scully,
I . “reminds me o’ the only bit o’
-*■ romance I was ever mixed up in.
Was workin’ on a contrak at the time with
Mat Conyers. Don't s’pose you know him?
Come from down Guunedali way. Only a
handful he was, but tall, an’ a reg’lar tiger
to work—when the fit took him. Could skite
a bit, too, an’ smoke cigarettes to no end.
We'd swagged it together, an’ bullocked to-
gether, off an’ on, for years. Itippin’ good
mate.
“Hadn’t neen long on this contrak, though,
fore he took to wanderin’ off by himself.
Never did that before. Said he d dropped
across an old acouaintance —farmer chap
name o’ Bill Maynaid. Don’t s’pose you
know him? Come from down Condobolin
way. struck me he was aooced fond o’ old
Maynard. Useter stop out blatherskitin’
purty near all night sometimes.
“Bv-’n’-Dye, I discovers the old chap’s got
a rather good-lookin' dauguter. Her front
name was Harriet. It’s Harriet yet, by the
way. Felt sorry for Matthew when I heard
that. He was deau shook on her—anyone
with half an eye could see —an’ that
meant dissolution for us if it come to a head.
Best-mate I ever had, too—barrin’ Murry
Brown.
“One day Maynard asked him to bring his
mate over for Sunday dinner. Didn’t like
goin’ at fust; but Mat reckoned ’twould look
unsociable if I refused. Also told me, in
confidence, that he wanted me to talk to old
Bill while he mashed Harriet. Seemed to me
a man ought to do that much for a mate.
The .old chap’s always a meddlin’ sort of a
person when you’re pokin’ round after his
daughter. Seems to want to be courted all
the time himself. • So I greased me boots, an’
put on a clean flannel, an’ dolled meself up
geue’lly, an’ we went to dinner.
"Fust sight of Harriet upset me tumble.
Never was so slowed by a gurl before. She
was purty as paint could make her, an’ as
fetch} n’ in her ways as a stump-extractor.
“Long before we got back to camp I began
to wish there was no such person as Mat-
thew Conyers in creation. We wur such
good mates, too. But gurls is gurls—an’
ev’ry man gets a feelin’ about him sometime
or ’nother that he wants one of ’em to keep.
1 wanted Harriet Maynard, dead sure.
“Well, I got into the habit o’ goin’ to see
old Bill then—just as Mat did, in a manner
o' speakin’. Mat didn’t like it, an’ ev’ry day
we discovered some bad p’ints about each
other that we’d never guessed before. We
didn’t pitch now as we useter, an’ we never
mentioned the Maynards in one another’s
bearin’.
“Mat would go off alone after tea, without
savin’ a word, an’ he'd be smokin’ a pipe
with Bill when I’d drop in. Not likin’ to
interrupt tli’ conversation, I’d jine the
missus an’ Harriet. That would nark Mat.
By-’n’-bye, he’d pretend not to be goin’ out,
an’ would lie down on his bunk till I left.
Then he’d drop in just as old Bill had got
me fixed with a long, dreary yarn ’bout
nuthin’ in purtikler.
“Fair murderin’ t’ave to sit quiet an’ look
pleasant, an’ ’pear interested, while he’d be
jabberin’ be the furlong, an’ me wantin’ to
see the gurl, an’ knowin’ Mat was makin’ up
to Her somewhere all the time.
“Didn’t get home on me more’n twice,
though. I’d stroll off, if he wouldn’t go
ahead, then drop in a bit later an’ cop
Harriet. That useter kill him dead. Still
we never mentioned the subjek. Seldom spoke
at all, an’ ’twas plain we’d go different tracks
once that contrak was over.
“By-’n’-bye he got another fellow on the
job to talk to old Bill. Dan Doiney his
name was, Don’t s’pose you knew him?
Come from down Deniliouiu way Then m*
an’ Mat would sit one on each side of
Harriet, scowlin’ at one another like two
strange dogs. Warn’t much talkin’ either.
Harriet useter get dead tired of it. an’ would
go out to hear Dan pitchin’. So Mat dropped
Dan. , .
“We useter live purty cheap, mean Mat
—goin’ about in just bare coverin’, an’
wearin’ ’em as long’s they’d hold together.
Courtin’ put a set on that ’conomy. He
started fust with white shirts an’ stand-up
collars —reg’lar ear-props—an’ neckties, an’
a brand-new suit, an’ a straw hat. Of course,
I ’ad to foller to be in the runnin’; an’
CONSOLATION.
“Never mind those fellows chaffing, Jack — you're not a bad old sort, after all.”
“Yes, Boss. Fac' is, Boss, me an' you is the only ivhite men in the distric'!”
there was a washin’ an’ ironin’ bill ev’ry
week to pay. Useter wash our own duds in
a bucket afore that. Then he gets high-
heeled boots, an’ brushes an’ blackin' to clean
’em; an’ a silk han’kerchief an’ o-d.v-ko-lone;
an’ a glass an’ comb an’ hairbrush, an’ bees-
wax for his moustache. ' I ’ad to get them
kind o’ things, too; wouldn’t even lend
me a boot-brush. Harriet was makin’ things
purty expensive, I tell you. Begun to won-
der if the contrak would pan out courtin’
expenses. But Mat warp’t done yet.
“He spekm-lates next in a toothbrush,
an’ useter scrub ’is grindps ev’ry ev’nin’ at
the waterhole; then a gingham, bless your
soul; an’ a silver-mounted pipe, an’ a
tobacco-pouch, an’ a Waterbury—an’ Heaven
knows what he didn’t get. Darn near broke
me keepin’ pace with him. An’ wearin’ the
superfl’ous things was fair crucifyin’. Them
starch shirts was something awful, an’ the
stand-up collars ringbarked me till I couldn’t
chew without hurtin’. As for them small-
sized, high-heeled boots, I got that worried
an’ sore I useter wear me big bluchers till I
wuz close to the place, an’ carry me coat an’
vest an’ courtin’ boots an’ gingham under me
arm. Why he wanted a gingham at night
I dunno; but as he took it I lugged mine
along, too, jes’ to show es I had one. But
Matthew warn’t done yet.
“He begins buyin’ presents next for Har-
riet —fruit an’ lollies an’ chocolates be the
barrerload; fancy-colored silk han’kerchiefs
(an’ they’re expensive things, you know),
bottles o’ scent, gloves, boxes o’ pins, needle-
cases, inanicore sets, an’ such like. We wur
playin’ nap for that bit o’ skirt. I’d go one
better’n him, then he’d go one better’n me
again; an’ so on. Ruther feared he’d wind
up with a ’orse an’ sulky to drive her out in,
or something o’ that sort. But the flood
come an’ put a sudden stop to it all. Warn’t
sorry. I assure you.
“We’d finished our job when the wet set
in, an’ soon’s we wur settled with, Mat goes
off on his own without so much as good-day
to me. Seen a chap next day name o’ Jack
Thompson. ' Don’t s’pose you knew him?
Come from down Gilvandra way. Tells me
Mat’s goin’ to work for Maynard soon’s the
-weather took up a bit. That hit me hard.
’S a big handicap when the other fellow’s
on the premises. Reckoned he had a long
pull on me, anyhow, an’ felt purty glum as I
strolled over on the Sunday.
“The flood was at its highest then, an’
shiftin’ camp warn’t to be thought of. Had
a notion o’ poppin’ the question that day—
’fore Mat ’ad time to get anything like a
lead on in the courtin’. Knowed he’d put my
pot on with old Bill if he got the least show.
“Well, when I gets there I sees there’s a
bit of excitement goin’ on. Harriet was
adrift m an old. flat-bottomed punt that
belonged to the place. She’d been paddlin’
about with one oar, an’ let it slip somehow.
It was floatin’ near shore, but the punt was
driftin’ out into the current. Mat was nearly
bustin’ —teariu’ up an’ down, shoutin’ to
Harriet to do this, an’ yelling to Maynard
to do that. Just then a heap o’ cedar boards,
lashed together in the form of a triangle,
floated round the point of the hill. I plunged
in an’ got aboard it, an’ was paddlin’ it with
me hand towards the oar, when in jumps
Mat an’ collars it. He climbs on to the craft,
an' starts pullin' like Bill Beach Didn’t
seem to notice me at all. I didn’t say any-
thing, but pulls out a short plank an’ gives
a hand. Was ruther risky to Harriet to be
squabblin’ just then as to who had the most
right to save her.
“The punt was a long way ahead of us, an’
we could see Harriet kneelin’ ag’in the seat,
boldin’ on to the side with one hand, an’
wavin’ the other to us, encouragin’ like. We
’ad our work cut out from the jump to steer
that blamed three-cornered craft through the
trees an’ the floatin’ timber an’ rubbish. At
last we got fairly out into the stream, but
the punt was still half a mile ahead, an’
driftin’ straight for the scrub on Susan
Island. Looked purty serious then. The
scrub was half-covered, an’ you know how
water shoots an’ curls round obstructions o’
that kind. Reckoned there'd be a disaster,
dead sure.
“We wur paddlin’ full rip when there was
a mishap on board, an’ another dose of ex-
citement. The three-cornered fakus fouled a
whirlpool, an’ she was whusk round an’ round
like greased lightnin’. Mat warn’t a good
sailor, an’ purty soon he was pitched over-
board an’ sucked under. Thought he was a
gorner for a bit; but he popped up d’rekly,
an’ I hauled him in with the plank. The
whirlpool, though, had shook up the craft so
much that the planks began to bulge an’
scatter; an’ out from between ’em comes a
swarmin’ regiment o’ crawlin’ critters. _ She
carried more ants an’ beetles an’ caterpillars
LAST OF THE MONTH.
“ 'Ere, quacks, Eve got a claim agen that f[?]od.”
“Well, put in your bill.”
an’ scorpions an’ san-ty-pees an’ lizards an’
other pesky insecks to the square inch than
Noah had ever dreamp of. Stoppin’ to brush
’em off our legs, an’ shunt them as wur extra-
objectionable overboard, took up a lot o’
time.
“Steppin’ back from one trav’lin’ pizen
fact’iy. i went overboard meself. Mat could
’ave easy reached me with the oar when I
come up, but he ’adn’t missed me, seem’ly.
Yelled out to him, but he was hard o’ hearin’
on water, somehow. Never turned his head,
an’ only stopped for a second now’n’again to
make a swipe at a bull-ant or something.
Warn’t a square go, that.
“Anyway, shaped for the trees on Susan
Island, an’ swum l:ke Dick Cavill. Mat was
rods ahead, an’ runnin’ a bit wide o’ the
island. Harriet was swallowed in the scrub
somewhere. Seen Mat clutch a bush, but it
broke, an’ he swept out o’ sight round the
island. I brightened up cons'd'rable then.
Had purty straight cuttin’ for Harriet —
barrin’ she warn’t dead. Brutal hard swim-
min’, though. ’Tany rate, I managed to hit
Susan 'bout the middle, an’ clumb along the
trees, peerin’ round. By-’n’-bye, I hears some-
thing, an’ coo-ees.
“ ‘Come quick!’ sez Harriet. ‘I can't get
out o’ the water —there’s snakes in the
boughs.’
“ ‘Stop where y’ are a minute,’ I sez to
her. ‘l’m cornin’.’
“The trees wur purty thick, an’ not too
bushy; an’ I dumb along like a flyin’-fox till
I gets nigh her. She was dingin’ to a tree
that stood away a bit by itself —her blouse
torn from her shoulder, an’ her wet hair
bangin' round her neck. Swum out to her
an’ got her on to a limb, so she could rest
awhile.
“Hadn’t been there long when I twigged
Barefooted Tom spinuiu’ by in a boat—a
long way off. Don’t s’pose you knew him?
Come from down Quirindi way. Didn’t
bother singin’ out. Hadn’t been long enough
there to make impressions yet. ’Twas sum-
mer time, an’ though ’twas pourin’ rain, an’
all the island was. covered ’cept the tree-tops,
an’ there wur snakes there an’ creepin’
things be the million, an’ nothin’ to eat, I
reckoned Harriet wouldn’t come to no harm
for a week or so; an’ it would be something
for her to remember me by. Seemed to me
I had best right to her now. ’Tany rate, I
was ready to light for it if Mr. Matthew
turned up in the scrub, an’ come clamberin’
over to us like an interferin’ gorilla.
“Near dusk we dumb down again, an’
swum along together to the opposite side of
the island. Picked a good clump o’ trees
for a camp, an’ gathered up a heap o’ dead
timber from the water to make a sort o’
platform. Then I broke off armfuls o’ soft
bushes an’ made a comfortable bed for Har-
riet. Sat by her there for hours, keepin’
the rain off her face. Hadn’t that bloomin'
umbrella with me when it would ’a’ been o’
some, use. The wind fair howled through
them trees, an’ the water roared round like
Niagara. People wur shoutin’ an’ screamin'
from housetops, cattle wur lowin’ away
south of us, an’ lights wur flashiu’ here and
there as rescue parties rowed about over
the farms. Night was that thick black, too.
you could scarce hear yourself talk through
it.
“Harriet warp’t too good in the mornin'.
Courtin’ in wet tree-tops didn't agree with
her.
“ ‘We’re in a purty tight fix, Harriet,” f
sez, eonsoliu like. ‘Wouldn’t be so bad if wo
could get down an’ ’ave a walk. ’D ruther
walk than swim.’
“ ‘lt’s awful!’ sez she. ‘However are we
goin’ to get out of it'/’
“ ‘Don’t you worry,’ sez I, easy like. ‘You
an’ me’s goin’ to be happy together, Harriet."
“ ‘We deserve to be after this.’ sez she.
“ ‘An’ after this,’ sez I, stealin’ me arm
round her neck an’ me hand under her chin,
‘shall I tell his Reverence Y’
“‘What’ll you tell himY’ sez she.
“ ‘That we’ve got a job o’ tyin-up for him
to do.’ I tells her.
“ ‘ls it a weddiu’ you mean?’ sez she.
lookin’ bashful an’ pleased same time.
“ ‘Eggs-ackly !’ sez I.
“ ‘Do you want me true?’ sez she, shy-
like.
“ ‘My oath!’ sez I.
“ ‘You can ask mother,’ she sez.
“ ‘Never mind mother,’ sez I. ‘She’s got
an old man of her own. Say the word, an’
we’ll chance all about her.’
“ ‘AH right!’ sez she; an’ I was that
durned pleased meself I forgot where I was
an’ knocked her up hard and sudden. Crash
went the platform, an’ we tumbled
through into the water. Warn’t pleasant
that, but it kinder made the happy
moment easier t’ remember. Clumb into a
big tree then, an’ soon after sunrise we sees
Jack Ford an’ a nipper cruisin’ round an'
pickin’ up things. _ Don’t s’pose you knew
him? Good singer; come from down Bre-
warrina way. Hollered fit to bust now.
Wanted to get off that island extra quick,
Gettin’ purty hungry. Stiff, too.
“Thought he warn’t goin’ to tackle it fust.
but after pullin’ a long way up, he turned
sudden an’ shot out into the current. Soon
swept down, an’ in half an hour or so we
wur aboard.
“Two hours’ hard pullin’ landed us at
Morris’s. Don’t s’pose you knew him?
Farmer chap from Balranald way. Give him
two quid for that job—last I had. Courtin’
Harriet dead-broke me, after all. Had to
pawn that gingham when I got home—an'
the Waterbury, glued shirts, toilet rek-wisits,
silk han’kerchiefs, an’ lots of other things
that warn’t no use ’cept to bustle Matthew
Conyers. Had to take more contraks, too,
an’ warn’t able to tell his Reverence for a
year or more. Guv him the vital intelli-
gence at last though.
“Matthew Conyers? Oh, yes: Matthew
turned up about a month after. .Didn’t stay
long though—an’ never sed so much as good-
day to me. Cleared out to goodness knows
where. Useter be a purty good mate, too:
but gurls is gurls, an’ there's no denyin’ a
man must ’ave one of ’em to keep. Feel much
better now. anyway.”

A Ballad of Old Days.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE whaling ships have come to port,
'Gainst yonder shore they loom ;
To roving men and roving keels
Our harbor offers room.
And barnacled and tressed with weeds,
And soaked with noisome oil,
Right glad of port they sleep at last,
Tired-out with too much toil.
Across the seas and round the seas
A-inany moons they sailed,
And now fat quarry found and killed,
And now the quarry failed.
Their anchors down, their canvas furled,
Broad beamed and black they ride —
Plain working ships of honest build,
Bluff-bowed against the tide.
The whaling men have left their decks,
Each ship in silence floats ;
The Brown Bear Inn shall hear to-night
The roar of sun-browned throats.
With fighting whales and killing whales
A toilsome task was theirs;
With setting sails and reefing sails,
They had their fill of cares.
The red, red rum is royal drink
For men new come from sea;
Make up, make up for thirsty days
With nights of revelry!
Now one has bought himself a scarf,
And struts the peer of kings ;
And one has hired a fiddling man
To fiddle while he sings.
And yon is one of thrifty make.
With whalebone sticks to sell
Good marketing be his to-day,
And may he prosper well!
A Sydney lass within his arms,
The dandy of the ships
Is giving gold for more than gold—
The coinage of red lips.
To eyes long used to shipless seas
And noons of sun and snow,
How strange, how quaint the busy life
That passes to aDd fro!
For yonder goes a scarlet squad
With even-striding feet.
Unto the roar of fife and drum
They march the sunlit street.
And here (beware ye sailor men
Of slinking rogues and thieves!)
Are some that went but yester-year
With arrows on their sleeves.
Beside his team a teamster plods,
His long-thonged whip at rest;
He takes the road, the rutted road,
The road that stretches west.
And sailormen shall sail afar,
And moons shall wax and wane;
And light-of-loves forget their lads,
Ere he trudge back again.
Enough ! Why talk of this or that —
That may, or may not, be:
The red, red rum is royal drink
To those new come from sea.
The Brown Bear Inn upon the Rocks
Shall roar with rude delight;
Make up, make up for thirsty days
With revelry to-night!
There, fo’c’s’le folk on nimble toes
In jaunty sailor rig,
With arms akimbo, heads a-sway,
Shall dance a salt-sea jig.
With heel and toe, and heel and toe,
They’ll dance the hour around ;
A fiddle-string, a fiddle-bow
Shall move them with their sound.
The red, red rum is, royal drink
To those new come from sea—
“ Now pass the jug, now fill the glass,
For thirsty men we be'!”
And round and round the glass shall go—
At every round a health—
Her name! The Ship! Fair winds to her !
“Good luck, old salt, and wealth !”
And they shall tell the tale again
Of how. beneath the moon,
r l hey slew the whale, the great bull-whale.
With" lances and harpoon.
And they shall tell of Polar Seas,
And chill, still, starry nights,
AN hen, like red breakers on a beach.
Up rushed the Southern Lights.
And they shall muse on Lotus Lands.
Ringed round with golden calm.
And brown-armed girls with lustrous eyes.
And aisles of island palm.
And they shall tell the tale again
Of how, beneath the stars.
They saw the phantom whaling ship,
AVith phantom sails and spars.
She moved, with not a wind astern,
And ne’er a breeze abeam ;
With still, set faces stood her crew—
Each face a pallid gleam.
A spectral skipper paced her deck,
• A spectral helmsman steered ;
■They bailed her, asked her name and
port—•
She paled and disappeared.
Then “Ho-heave-oh, and 110-heave-oh,”
And- “Shake the rafters down!”—
A song of jovial whaling men
Shall rise in Sydney town.
And one shall sing of black-eyed Bess,
And one of Jess or Jane ;
And all shall send their hearts a trip
To greet their loves again.
And citizens long hours a-bed
Shall turn to left and right,
And breathe a curse on whaling men
That break the peace of night.
Yet let them growl, and groan and growl,
And twist, and turn, and fret;
Would they have murmured words and
prayer
Where sailormen are met?
The bright harpoons are stored away,
The bos’n pipes no more;
The whaling ships have come to port,
The whaling men to shore.

Things I Think I Did.
THE EXPULSION,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ABOUT GOOD years ago I was walking
one day near the Euphrates. It was
as near the beginning of the world as
matters, seeing that man had bad a coherent
memory of events for only 20 years, and
nothing begins until it is recorded. Abram
was still far off waiting to be born. Noah
had yet to arrive. Cain had still to kill Abel
for talking too much.
At that point the Euphrates is a fairly
good stream. The soil is sandy loam ; but
there is little rainfall, and the hungry plain
was like a beggar, with the wealthy Eu-
phrates passing by him without word or
dole. Easterly, but still on that great plateau
which tills the distance between the Mediter-
ranean and the Indus, were places yet un-
founded but yet to be famous —Bagdad,
Persepolis, Ispahan and Shiraz. Westerly
—Babylon had still to wait 2000 years to
get itself builded.
The river ran away to uselessness; and
the sea and the soil, that would grow any-
thing if but water were given it, desiccated
to the typhoon from the north-east and the
simoon that pulverised the desert of Arabia
and covered fecund soil with sterile sand. It
was therefore the more cheering in the late
afternoon to suddenly raise a green and
gracious garden in that mordant sand; for
here a real man had harnessed a little of tin-
river volume to his needs, and the open
■sluices had made the desert open in plenty.
I could see, broken by a glossy perfumed
grove of magnolias and a rampart of rhodo-
dendron, the date-palm and the olive, and
grape-vines looping themselves from trees-of
fig and tamarind. There were the three
forms of coffee—bud, bloom and berry—on
the same bush. Poppies broke in scarlet
among the wheat. The big red-stalked leaf
or the rhubarb showed by a riffled sluice.
The damask rose and the aster and the club-
bed bosses of hydrangea rose behind it. Be-
yond, a pink stain and a purple blur, which
were the bud of apricot and peach, and a
half-mile of iris at their feet.
I saw the hump of a dromedary moving
through the trees, and then the head of the
beast lifted flat to ease the pain at his nose-
peg, and below the flat, held head I saw a
turban and the forehead of the Man. A tree
hid him for a moment, and then he came
fully into view, leading the dromedary with
all the plough trappings still around its
shoulders and over its withers and before its
hump.
He was a big, fair-bearded, yellow-haired
man. fie had a fine brow and very direct
and honest eyes. He was straight-nosed, and
ruddy of face, broad-shouldered and big of
leg and arm—-the ideal strong man, tapering
fxom shoulder to hip, a wedge of muscle. He
wore a sleeveless tunic of some vegetable
material, which a residence in the Pacific
6000 years later would have taught me was

the fibre of the cocoa nut palm. 11 is legs
below the knee were bare to the leathern
greaves that covered his shins and tended in
sandals. He had an air of sadness and dis-
illusionment which yet could not contradict
the evidence of energy which surrounded him
like a rarer and brilliant atmosphere.
He stopped and bowed courteously, and
we understood each other; for people of
rudimentary vocabularies had not yet made
differentiations of speech for the world.
“Good day,” said I. “My name is George.”
“And mine Adam —the first man.”
“The first man! But I have met thou-
sands of men, and almost all were older than
you!”
“Not.the first man horn ; but the first man
to think clearly, to remember definitely—
the first man to find out.”
“To find out? What things?”
“Come with me and you shall see.”
lie began to lead his camel along a track
to the west. Then he stopped suspiciously,
and motioned me to precedence.
“Go first, please.”
ONE BETTER.
“My wife is as unreliable as the weather .”
“Mine beats yours; she’s as unreliable as the weather prophet."
At Ihe next turn I saw the house —a ram-
bling structure on an elevation sentried by
cypresses and partly hidden in a riot of great
Persian roses and a tangle of jasmine. A
woman ran into the house as we approached.
I had only time to see that she was clothed
from ankle to elbow, that she was fair, and
that ropes of yellow hair hung to her waist-
line —when, not as if in fear of the
stranger, but for respect of the
master, she ran from signt.
Adam looked at me to anticipate
inquiry, sighed, and said : “Madam
Eve.”
As he stripped the dromedary of
his harness in the meadow I heard
her calling: “Cain ! Abel! —
Come!” Adam sighed again, and
led the way to a grove with a
runnel from a high limestone rock,
and there we washed, and went
thence to supper as the west lost
its lire and paled to amethyst be-
fore darkening to the blue and vel-
ret-soft night of the region.
Madam Eve waited on us. I
had never until then seen a woman
so dressed —not for comfort or
warmth as more primitive people,
but as if to cover shame. There
were roasted birds, fish, wine and
fruit, and her work was to serve
the table and be silent. Abel, a
bright-eyed, yellow-haired boy, sat
at the left of his father, and only
to him did Adam seem to soften,
giving him meat from his plate and
sops of wine. He rarely spoke to
Cain, the dark, meagre youth at
the side of the table—lank-haired
and alien ; and when Adam looked
at him it was with the eyes of a
doubting bulldog summing tip a
stranger. The full-dressed yellow-
haired woman moved about the
table with the soft footfalls bf a
cat. There was something furtive
even in her removal of dishes,
something feline in her final exit
at the curt nod of Adam.
lie led the way to the garden.
Abel brought the wine to a rough
bench in a half-circle of magnolias, and
Adam and I sat alone in the starlit, per-
fumed night. Out of silence and wine comes
sympathy. I touched his hand accidentally,
and he gripped mine.
“You are miserable, Adam?”
“God knows.”
‘‘Why don't you leave h r?"
“I am wretched with her. I would be more
wretched alone. I love her and hate her. 1
know her, yet I love her. I cannot bear
speech or touch of her. ahd I cannot bear
not to see her. ; Ljsten ! There is as yet no
man on earth but you who understands.”
And in that soft Persian night—in the
garden by Euphrates. 2000 years before
Babylon’s chimneys were hot—l heard the
story of Adam, called the First Man because
he was the first man who could express him-
seif.
The Groves of Paradise were on an island
of the Indian Ocean—but such an island!
Eden made itself there with the perfection of
the temperate zones and the t’ opic-s all in
one. It was a great garden with four little
rivers through it; gold in the central boss of
mountain, almost always hidden in co»l
cloud; and pearls in the deep sea. Adam
awoke to himself one day in such a setting.
He knew that the procession of its beauty
had marched before him from the beginning
of his memory ; but, whereas until this day
he had existed by instinct, he now began con-
scious life. Instinctively he had selected the
purple iris and the white rose from the rattle
of plants, and made a garden of them. Mag-
nolia and marvel of Peru filled the scented
hours. Bloom of peach and apricot, apple
and pear and quince splashed the light blue
air. He had planted them for beauty and
improved them into use.
He lay under the palm trees, whose
fronds threshed susurrantly, and saw the
gleaning sickle of the beach dip into seven
fathoms; a green turtle sinking in the green
water; a great, glossy, green-leaved tree
leaning to the sea almost at right angles to
its roots, its rimose trunk hidden by orchids.
His eye missed nothing—the raffle of yam
growth in the teeming s,oil; the screaming
flashes of crimson and emerald, which were
painted lories ; the gorgeous bird of Paradise
dancing in his tree to captivate the hen ; and
every papaya tree with its colony of shriek-
ing. starlings,. glossy and vulgar as black
satin: —and its gourd-shaped, rotten-ripe
fruit, and a starling eating it to a shell
from inside as rats eat an uncut cheese.
With the eyes of his memory he could see
the pigs and snakes and wild beasts he had
mastheaded, on the central boss of the
island, by the strength of a ring fence
wrought with labor that was sweet when
effort crowned it—for even Paradise in the
making includes all the venomous errors of
Nature and all her friends. He turned on
an elbow and saw the little porcelain-shelled
spa spiders take in their legs and roll to
safety in the sea, and the baby pearlshell. as
big as thumbnails, sink to the protection of
their self-spun cable.
The frangipanni made the air heavy with
perfume. Adam looked at a frigate bird
wheeling slowly above the jewel of his island
and saw that everything was good. Lli<
beardless face was golden in the light, his
yellow hair a golden flame; his quick mus-
cles moved under a hairless skin of silk ; his
prone figure was all beauty, grace and clean-
liness.
“The chief things of life are water, bread
and sunlight.” said Adam, who had been
alone from infancy, and knew not that soli-
tude is a weary pleasure taken alone. “Water,
bread and sunlight.” he said and slept.
Around the western horn of the sickled
bay floated a raft—chance-made of a dead
apd drifting tree, and, the necessity of the
gil l who straddled it, momently drawing up
her legs from the water in swift and fleet-
ing horror of a shark. The. raft drifted
with tin' current across the chord of the
arc as if it would follow to the other horn
of the crescent and turn again to the sea.
The girl felt the danger, and when the tree
was abreast of the sleeping Adam, she stood
upon it and spurned it seawards, and with
that initial force swam quietly towards the
beach. Standing breast deep, she watched
the tree with swifter motion enter the cur-
rent. turn from the point and so to sea
again; and shuddered. Then she waded
ashore; went almost double, so that her
yellow mane touched the ground; and
wrung the water from her hair. Then she
stood up with the salt shining on her face,


a fairly tall, dazzlingly fair girl—a honey
blonde, blue-eyed, red-lipped, golden-haired,
with such another halo of youth about her
head as Adam wore.
She moved away to the shade on her
right hand, startled a colony of starlings,
tasted a partly-eaten papaya and found it
good, saw a runnel from the spring trick-
ling to the beach, and went on all fours and
drank from it, and then admired herself in
a still pool. A rustling in the leaves, and
fear dominated her. She waited wide-eyed ;
a sigh; and silence and curiosity led her to
the left. And there lay a youth as beautiful
as herself; and except for the boarskin
sandals and for the leathern greaves from
ankle to knee, and a band of palm cloth, as
naked. She had never seen before supreme
beauty. She worshipped it with breath half
suppressed, and Adam awoke as the sun
went to its setting.
* -* * *
She could tell only by signs that she came
from the sea, and Adam immediately be-
lieved that beauty is ocean born. She could
tell him little more even when he had labori-
ously taught her a language. She was, except
for her beautiful body, trivial, indolent. Life
was vocal to her only in sensation.
“Why do you call me Eve?”
“Because you came to me in the evening.”
“But why do you call sunset ‘evening’ in-
stead of something else?”
“Because. I know that it is the only
word.”
Then she laughed and threw a mango at
him.
He garlanded her with flowers, and so
gave tongue to her vanity. He made a skirt
of palm cloth, and she threw it away when
she found it interfered with the effect of
the garland. He made cane bracelets for
her, and she forced them to the upper arm
and impeded her circulation so that she
might wear spikes of frangipanni in the
bracelets. Once in a dead pearl oyster she
found a pearl and screamed in her delight.
When Adam told her there were many such
in the bay sin* would not let him rest until
he had dived for them in 10-fathom water,
bringing up a shell at every dive, but only
I ne pearl in ten shells. So he dived often,
resting for a moment with nostrils blown
thin in search of air, and diving again with
a great stone to find gems for his beloved
cruelty.
The cave did not suit her because the
wild beasts he had mastheaded in the central
island might enter, and the blindly doting
youth shouldered another labor of Hercules
and builded for her the first house —the
building being no labor compared with the
thinking of it —until invention led him to
imitate the root chambers of a colossal ban-
yan, and tree trunks suggested mounting the
house on stilts.
She paid him a thousand-fold with the
careless admiration of a moment.
“How do you know so much, Adam, dear?”
she asked with that concluding rising inflec-
tion that sounded like the coo of a pigeon.
“I have eaten of the tree of Knowledge,”
lie said, laughing.
“Where does it grow?”
“It grows out of the tree of Life —it is
experience which can only come of living.”
While he worked she decked herself with
new garlands, as the old withered quickly.
It was enough for him to look at her occa-
sionally and see her added beauty in that
setting of Paradise without one warring note
of hue or form ; and then back to work with
all his wages paid.
So they had the new house, which was a
toy for a month and might have been her
salvation for ever had Adam, the poet-lover,
made a helpmate, a partner and subordinate
laborer of her. But he had placed her on a
pedestal, and she, having some knowledge
of the goddess he worshipped, subconsciously
despised his judgment sufficiently to make
her play any tune she pleased on his doting
madness. For, like most of her sex, she
was a child mentally—and these, given a
little, take all.
CARELESS WOMAN!
B ILLIE: "Did you order two when they brought Cis and Kittie, Mother?"
MOTHER : "Am, dear, only one.”
BILLIE: “And you took both? Dad’s right—yon are dashed careless in your housekeeping.”
It was when the toyhouse had become
common that she found the half of cocoanut
shell with a heavy brilliant black sand in it.
and a glistening yellow metallic and coarser
sand, and certain rough white and blue
stones that were almost brilliant in sunlight.
‘-‘What are they?” she asked.
“I put that black sand in the fire, and it
gives a white metal, but when I melt that
yellow sand it doesn’t change color. The
stones are pretty, but too hard to rub even.’
“I like them, de-ar.”
So another labor of Hercules; a perilous
journey into the ‘wild beasts’ cage in the
centre boss of the island, walled from flic
fertile shell-shaped plain about it by a great
rift in the earth for nigh seven-eighths of the
circle—the other eighth being closed by the
stockade made by his hands.
STONES THAT SPEAK.
“Ah, Pat. you seem to have plenty of time to ruminate on things. Yon know what they
say about ‘sermons in stones’?”
“ Begobs , Oi dunno about sermons. But it’s manny’s the toime Oi’vc found a brick a
dam good argyment.”
He did not wish to go, but lie had made
himself a slave, and he departed at sunrise
on his effort for nothing worth, closing the
pierced stockade behind him and beginning a
day of not finding, but being pursued. When
that night lie told her of his dangers, she
said “De-ar,” and told him that lie must
try again to-morrow.
He washed a little of the black and yellow
sand and the small hard stones from a creek,
but was pursued, and came back to the shore
in the dusk, weary and disheartened —rto_ be
again fed with new courage for the morning.
An odor of roasting, such as he had never
known before, struck his perfect sense of
smell, and she brought him a savory dish
of flesh.
“What is it?” he asked.
“O-o-o-h —that little animal we saw at
the stockade one day.”
“A pig—but who taught you to put it to
fire?”
“O-o-o-li! A'obody—l just thought!”
He had eaten and enjoyed, but old habit
came back and found a conscience.
“It’s wrong to take life, except to keep
your own. Fruit and cocoa nuts and oysters
and turtle eggs are all right, but”
“But they’re all alive, silly boy!”
“Well —yes! Beloved, you’re always
right.” .
“And you know those birds that dance/
“The birds of the Island —the birds of
Paradise?”
"Yes. Get one for me. I want to wear
its wings in my hair.”
“Take the life of beauty? No.”
“Oh, you must. How beautiful I’d look
then. Ifiil
But who gave jou such lughtiul
thoughts ~ ~
‘O-o-oli. I just thought, that s all.
“I can t do it.
De-ar !
And next day, with a sling-stone, Adam
killed a gorgeous raggiana as lie danced in
splendor for his hen. She made him save
the skin, and not knowing why lie did lie
dried it with wood ashes, and she donned a
wing either side of her head and hurried
him off to find the black and yellow sands,
Returning in the dusk to the crescent bay
weary but glad because successful, he stopped
at where the cliff ended and the flat sickle
of the shore began—stopped with the first
teal fear he had ever known, and waited in
a silence unbroken but by the sound of his
own thudding pulses. A face dark and
handsome in the way of a hawk —black hair
escaping from tlio scarlet cloth wound about
it—looked at him from the jungle on the
sea face. But for a moment Adam closed
his eyes as if sickened; then he ran forward
and found —nothing. The darkness swooped
on the island as a frigate bird upon a fish,
and Adam went back wondering.
He mentioned his illusion to Eve that
night. She laughed nervously, then shiv-
ered and drew closer to him.
Two days later he found an unknown
furrow in the beach, as if someone had
drawn a heavy tree from dry sand to water-
line. He mentioned that, and Eve laughed
at him, not nervously but confidently. And
next day he found a footprint on the sand
—large, and fiat from heel to toe —not Eve’s
high-arched foot, nor yet his own. He would
not tell her because she might be afraid.
He nursed his anxiety and fear all night,
and when he saw the beach swept clean next
day he forgot the tides, and was glad to
believe the experience an hallucination. He
went to his new work of washing alluvium
with a good mind; but anxiety tugged his
heartstrings homeward, and he approached
the hut an hour before sunset.
Voices ! Voices where none should be but
the chattering of Eve herself—eking ouc
want of thought with speech. lie wondered
only. No suspicion of the truth, no doubt-
ing of her entered his clean mind —sure of
itself, and therefore accepting all trustingly.
There is no slower accuser than honesty; no
more stupid discoverer of crime than the
true. The sense of hearing would prove
nothing to him. Even when he rounded the
house and saw that man whose dark, hawk-
like, handsome face had been an hallucina-
tion, standing in the Sacred Home with the
Goddess of that Sacred Home held willingly
in his arms, the sense of sight did not con-
vince Adam. It was only at Eve’s cry of
terror and the flight seawards of the dark
man that the passion of revenge was born
in a moment; and he pursued.
The dark man saw that he was cut off
from the place where Eve had made land-
fall, and where his boat was beached. He
ran northward away from the boat, as a
bird from her nest, as if to conceal ii.
Adam, with a new-born lust to kill setting
liis blood aflame, saw with joy that he could
run faster than the enemy. The man turned,
sobbing his exhaustion at where the beach
ended and tin' cliffs began, and Adam,
scarcely flushed by the pursuit, fell upon
him and joyfully strangled the dark man will)
his hands. H e looked at his kill, and laughed
like to a devil laughing at his own pain :
but the laugh ended in a sob as he saw that
the man had a bird of Paradise plume fast-
ened in the scarlet turban about his head.
It was no sudden betrayal and yielding then,
but the deliberate deception of a mature
woman going cold-bloodedly to deception. lie
tore the plume and turban from the dark
hair, and threw it on the sand; lifted the
body, and striding out to the limit of the
rocky cape, threw it into the deep water.
Phosphorescent shapes tore the blue as the
body disappeared, and Adam laughed again.
vShe had preferred the mature and crafty
man to the honesty of youth, and youth had
killed craft with strength.
He secured the turban and the plume,
and walked back along the beach where the
stranger’s dugout lifted to the making tide.
It was victualled for a voyage. He smelled
again the roasted flesh that Eve said she
had discovered. He made the boat fast by a‘
forest vine to-the tree of orchids, and smiled
bitterly at his own invention. And then he
returned to the hut and found her there
upon the earth —the withered garlands about
her neck, the bird of Paradise plume in her
hair; and she weeping the remorse which is
sorrow for detection.
“Stand up!”
She struggled to him and clasped his knees.
“Forgive!”
“What is that?”
"Don't kill me!”
"Is that what ‘forgive’ means? You
brought the word into the world with the
necessity for it.”
He tore the plumes from her hair, the
garlands from her shoulders, the flowered
bracelets from her arms, and the rough
chain of beaten gold and uncut sapphires
from her neck. Then he threw her from the
bed-place a roll of palm cloth which was
their covering, and said : —•
“Wrap it round you! Cover yourself!”
"Why? Oh, why?”
“I killed him. You shall tempt no
more—or as little as your owner permits.
These are the plumes the other thief wore.”
She shuddered at the plumes and turban,
and said again :-
"Don’t kill me!”
"I’ll think. Stay here! Don’t move from
the hut to-night!”
He left her and walked into the half-
darkness, and in a grove within earshot of
the sea he sat him down to think, and to be
accuser, defender and justice and punish-
ment in one.
A nightingale sang out of the verdurous
gloom, but beauty had gone from sound.
In his veins there seemed to beat the heavy
pulses of the sea. The dark plume shape
of a cypress rose definitely on one side of
the wood, and seemed to tell him to bear
it and forgive, while yet it looked like a
sword ready for his hand. Turtle landed
at the beach, and a new cruelty came to the
waiting man. He turned two on their
backs, laughed at their struggles, and re-
turned to the grove to his own.
“The chief things of life are water, bread
and sunlight. So I thought, and now I
know that the chief things of life are water
and bread, clothing, and a house to cover
shame. Shame which was not in my world
until two days ago. Which shall it be?
Justice and a dull unhappiness; or forgive-
ness and long agony? Which!”
Star after star looked palely in his face
and faltered down the sky, and then came
the sun, reprieving the world for another
day.
The spring pansy, the daffodil and rose
grew to the palm-tree boles, too perfect for
a dirtied world: the clover and the early
bee had lost their charm. His poisoned
thoughts leached the beauty from the'jasmine
and the wood.
He arose decided, went to the boat still
held by its restraining vine, and saw that it
was afloat upon the morning tide. Then to
the hut, where a tear-stained and dishevelled
woman, drab in the palm cloth as in widow’s
weeds, waited for the verdict.
“Collect all the food there is!” lie said
roughly.
He waited while she silently obeyed, load-
ing her shoulders with a great weight of
cocoanuts and fruit. Then he motioned her
to the boat. She obeyed, staggering down
SURE TO HAVE HEARD OE IT.
O’BRIEN: "Halloa, Murphy! Hud a spill?”
MURPHY: "My oath! Won’t t’ould man hick
up a dust!”
O’BRIEN: “Ah, he jabers, he need niver
know!”
MURPHY : “Oh, won't n’t he! He’s under the
bricks!”
the slope, looking at him appealingly to
know where all his chivalry had gone. But
he made no sign of her presence, lie took
long lines of sinnet and put them aboard the
dugout. Then lie lifted the turtles in; and
as he laughed she wondered when the old,
gentle, kindly Adam had been replaced by
this quietly fierce man who rejoiced at the
pain of innocent creatures.
lie motioned her to the boat, and then she
understood and knelt on the sand in suppli-
cation.
“Not to leave my island —-our beautiful
island, Adam?”
"Yes; it is too clean for us.”
"To leave Paradise ?”
"Yes; for pain. You brought shame to the
place I loved, and exile is our punishment.”
She looked at him and saw that nothing
could move him. She stepped into the dug-
out and crouched in the after part, asking
only one question :
"Where do we go?”
"Anywhere—to try and sow the happy past
again and fail: but glad only that I have
found the truth.”
"What is that?”
"That all things human are lies.”
"I won’t go—l won’t go !”
"Sit down ! We are afloat —1 was your
worshipper, and now you are my slave until
death finds you.”
She collapsed whimpering. Adam had*-
found the way to use the grass sail that
depended from a mast of bamboo, lie set ii
and the island went astern. Clouds came
up behind them suddenly and blackened the
sky, but from the sun poured a shaft of
light which played upon the island with the
changing of the clouds. It was the flaming
sword that warned them that none once
leaving it re-enter Paradise.
I saw her next day, a drab woman with
splendid hair —cold misery in her eyes, and
a bitter smile upon her lips. Also I saw
why Adam loved Abel and doubted Cain.
In that dark, hawk-like face the dark man
of the island lived atrnin. I saw Eve, too.
discover that look of doubt, and her own
eyes flashed menace. The injured never

THE RAKE'S PROGRESS


The Grey Gulls.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grey gulls of Wellington are quar-
relling together;
High flying, low flying, wheeling round
the quays;
Kittiwake and mollyhawk, flirt of feet and
feather,
Beating up to windward or planing on the
breeze!
Vagrants, of the harbor-way their heritage
is slipping—
Strangers to the ocean and the big sea-
rains ;
The grey gulls of Wellington are hanging
round the shipping,
And the glamor of the City is a-throbbing
in their veins!
The white wings from farther out are liover-
iitg with caution,
Flinging down a challenge from the strong
green tide!
The grey gulls of Wellington have parted
with their portion
For a galley-mess of pottage the cooks put
overside.
0 white gulls, strong gulls, that hunt off
Terawhiti !
Skimming to the combers how the brave
wing spreads!
But the grey gulls of Wellington are tethered
to the City ;
And the grey gulls of Wellington are loaf-
ing round the sheds.
And the rustle of their pinions, and the
music of their flying
Are blended with the tramping and the
Shuffling of feet;
And the grey gulls of Wellington they mingle
their crying
With the rumbling of waggons and the
voices of the street.
High flying, low flying, clamorous and
speedy;
Quarrelling together, how the sharp tones
rise!
The grey gulls of Wellington are merciless
and greedy—
The cunning of the City is the cunning in
their eyes!

The Seven Fat Women Who Sat
on Seven Hot Slabs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PRAY do not be misled by the title: this
isn’t Maeterlinck. Likewise it lias no
connection with the Seven Deadly Sins :
it; deals solely with the One Deadliest Sin
the Curse of Eve.
WELL! WHY NOT?
The seven fat women sat heavily on their
seven hot slabs, sadly contemplating their
seven perspiring stomachs. They weren’t in
Hades, but. very near it.. They were in the
hottest chamber of the Turkish Baths, suffer-
ing torments for the one modern deady sin—
the sin of being fat.
They were not all so fat. Some were
slightly less so. One was even still less so;
she could pass, wedged within her new cor-
sets, as merely excessively plump. And they
all took up a considerable acreage of their
hot marble slabs; and the perspiration drip-
ping from their superficies sounded like a
tropical thunderstorm.
As all they wore were little singlets and a
worried look it was impossible to tell, ex-
cept from their conversation, whether they
had come’ from Potts Point or Petersham—
whether they were ladies or merely women.
The draper’s lady and Julia O’Grady are
sisters in their skin. Released from all their
strappings and lacings and tapes and whale-
bone and elastic they had happily sagged
down to mere mountainous lumps of human
plasticine. They looked like large masses of
vermilion squeezed out by an artist on a
gigantic palette.
And in that steamy room they stolidily sat
and perspired and contemplated their stom-
achs and conversed. They talked of Fat.
Sadly, wistfully, pathetically, proudly, miser-
ably, hopefully, apologetically they talked of
Fat. And their perspiration dripped and
dripped, like the tap of a shower left running
in the stilly night.
“Oh, no,” murmured the second fattest to
the fourth fattest. “I’m sure you’re not so
stout as that woman in the corner. Terri-
ble, I call it.”
“You really think so?” the fourth fattest
cooed.
“Why, she’d weigh half a stone more than
you. I’m sure, too, that I’m not so big as
that lady next her, am I?”
The second fattest was Hebrew in features,
looking less aggressively Semitic in that
naked assemblage of prehistoric beings than
when dressed as the latest streak of fashion.
And as she asked her eager question, there
was the naive hopefulness of a child in her
business-like, bargain-pricing eyes.
The fourth fattest had a difficult task, but
she was used to it. “Well,” she said, after
judicially summing-up the points —or lack of
points—in the smudge stewing in her own
juice opposite, "I suppose you’d weigh as
much, but then, you see, your stoutness is
muscular, and hers is simply fat.”
The second fattest woman was satisfied.
She had long ago learnt that she had to be.
“That’s what I always say,” she replied.
“I’ve always been well developed; and when
I see some of those scrags about, I’m thank-
ful I’m well covered. Not that I come here,
like those other ladies, for my stoutness.”
“Indeed?” the fourth fattest murmured
with polite interest.
“No, it’s my appetite.”
“Oh, well, you ought to diet.”
“Diet ?” the second fattest protested. “I
come here once a week to improve my appe-
tite. At home I often sit right tlnough a
dinner and hardly touch more than five
courses; and at breakfast I just toy with a
grilled steak.” She indicated in gesture how
she toyed with steak. “My husband was
getting quite concerned w.tli me. Now I
find that after a Turkish bath I’m just fam-
ished ; and I assure you I really enjoy the
steak and oysters they give you here. I
always have a second helping.”
She relapsed into anticipations of steak
and oysters.
“It’s terrible, ain’t it?” the third fattest
ventured to her neighbor, the fattest, as they
steamed together on the other side of the
room.
“The heat?” the «ther politely asked.
“No ; Fat.”
“I don’t worry,” the champion massively
replied. “I like a bit of plumpness—sets a
woman off. I think. I was always what men
call a fine figure of a woman. And well-
made women like us—of course, I don’t in-
clude that mountain over there”—she indi-
cated the second fattest —-“she’s disgustingly
fat, isn’t she? Well, as I was saying, a well-
made woman like you and me is the sort that
men admire. I’ve seen them look at me in
the street. I believe in a figure. Every
woman ought to have a figure—something
a husbflnd can feel comfortable with.”
“That’s all right,” sighed the third fattest,
“but I ain’t got a husband. What worries
me, though, is how I put on flesh. I’m a
cook, you see, and with me standing about in
a hot kitchen all day the fat seems to have
settled in mo hips.”
The fattest, who had evidently come in a
motor from Bellevue Hill, put up her lorg-
netj-e before she remembered that she had left
it with her jewellery and her clothes in the
disrobing cel!. Talking, like one lady with
another, with a cook ! It was dreadful, this
J a f of clothes. Without them you couldn’t
tell a lady l rom a servant. And persons like
CO oks should not be allowed inside Turkish
baths. She had a heavy thought of waddling
across the room to another seat, as far as
possible from the slab desecrated by cooks.
I* ll *- S ‘ J bot Eabby, and her non-
derosity held her so comfortably to her slab.
tfi a t s |, e mere ]y heaved a little sideways and
slowly sagged back again. But she indicated,
in-a manner long practised and unmistakable,
that the conversation with cooks was closed,
She flowed massively in the direction of her
neighbor on the other side,
“It’s all due to my drinking water,” she
explained to the least fattest. “All my doc-
tors tell me that. Now, I used to drink a
glass of. water every night before I went to
bed. Of course, on cold nights—or 0 n hot
nights—l put something into it. I did it for
years, and nobody told me till it was too
late. And Turkish baths don’t do me any
permanent good. I get three pounds off me,
sometimes three and a half, every time; but
it always comes off in the wrong place.”
There was no need for her to specify the
place. She was short; her tight legs that
merged without effort into her squat feet
dangled off the floor; and she sat pyramidi-
cal on a broad base.
“Exercise is the only thing that does me

good,” said the seventh fattest. “But then
I’m too lazy to take exercise.”
“I’ve tried it,” the fattest answered sor-
rowfully. “I take motor exercise every
afternoon ; but it’s no use.” She sluggishly
sighed. “But all women get stout, don’t
they? It’s marriage that does it. That is,
if you’re happily married. Now you” (she
disparagingly scanned the contours of the
seventh fattest), “I should say that your mar-
riage hasn’t been too happy. It’s worry that
keeps us thin —and, thank God, I’ve got no
worries.”
“Oh,” said the seventh fattest, carelessly
(it was so hot and it was so hard to think
of what one was saying), “I’m not married —
not really, you know. I don’t come here to
reduce myself, but to keep clean. I like
feeling clean.”
The champion fat woman snorted —at
least, she would have snorted if she had not
been so incredibly fat. All that she man-
aged to emit was a kind of clogged, oozy
grunt. Really, you had to be so careful
when you spoke to people who weren’t label-
led by their clothes. The fattest woman
perspired in sodden gloom, and wondered
heavily when her turn would come to be
massaged. She had been here longer than all
the rest, and already two other women had
been called out to the massaging slab.
The sixth fattest, who had
been observing the fifth fattest
with interest, turned to her. “Do
you know.” she diffidently be-
gan. “you’ve got a certain re-
semblance to Aureole Darling.
I’ve often seen her on the stage.
I suppose people have told you
about your resemblance to her?
Of course, she’s much slighter.”
The fifth fattest, having men-
tally decided that the sixth fat-
test was half a stone heavier
than herself —a mistake any
plump woman is liable to make
all through her life, merely re-
marked, “As it happens, I am
Aureole Darling.”
“Oh, I’m so sorry !” her neigh-
bor muttered. “At least. I’m
glad to meet you like this —so
unconventional and bohemian,
isn’t it? I’ve often' admited
your figure on the stage; but I
hadn’t any idea.... I suppose
it’s those corsets you wear. Do
tell me where you get them.”
The actress mentioned the
locality and also the perfectly
hopeless price. The sixth fat-
test suddenly felt the heat. That
heaven was not for her. “Fancy,”
she sighed. “Well, they’re worth
it —if they make all that differ-
ence in you. It’s dreadful, isn’t
it, the way we women have to
pull in? And the more you haul
in at one place the more you
bulge a t another. I never worried
about being plump before, but
now I’m in love; and though
my boy doesn’t say anything I
can see he is getting tired of squeezing the
bones of my corsets. It is beginning to tell
on him. And the other day I introduced
him to my mother; and I noticed he began
to think hard. The trouble is that I take
after my mother.”
“Then the best thing is to give up Turkish
baths, and send your mother,” suggested the
actress. ‘‘But if I don’t manage to get my
weight down I’ll lose my job. Isn’t it a
dreadful thing that the more pounds an
actress puts on the more pounds they take
off her salary?”
She got up to go to be massaged,
and the sixth fattest turned to the fourth
fattest. “How horribly bulky Aureole Dar-
ling is!” she said. “That’s her just gone
out. And on the stage you’d never guess,
would you? I’m going to chuck Turkish
baths and get corsets like hers —if it ruins
me.
“I’ve tried ’em,” sighed the fourth fattest.
“My dear, you feel like a rock—or a blown-
up tyre. Only the trouble is, you can’t be
deflated. It’s all right for Aureole Darling
to wear ’em —she’s paid for it, and it’s only
for a few hours every night; but I’m not
going to torture myself for so slight a thing
as plumpness. It’s the plump ones that
marry, anyhow ; and then if you do begin to
get—well, fat, it doesn’t matter so very
much. You’re married, all right; and your
husband can’t divorce you for stoutness. Be-
sides, they like it. Look how they laugh at
those skeletons you see in the surf —no, I
don’t go in bathing. I think it unwomanly,
don’t you, in those costumes? No straight
front corsets for me—-nor straight back ones,
either. It’s lovely, isn’t it, dear, just to let
yourself flop?”
She let herself flop.
So they waited and discussed the most
momentous thing in their women’s universe,
the deadly sin of Fat. And one by one they
were summoned from the steam room to take
their places on the tables, wobbling, heaving,
quivering masses of putty, over which, as
over a swampy morass, the masseuses gin-
gerly worked, pommelling soft flesh, and
beating up the batter of these human
puddings into a sort of temporary solidity.
And at last there was left in the hot

sitting in Buddhist contemplation, Solemnly
gazing at her stomach. The two hefty mas-
seuses, who had selected their victims with
the swift expertness of shearers choosing
their sheep, were deliberately dawdling over
the second and third fattest respectively.
Each of them was dodging the massaging of
the fattest—last, but not least—of the seven
fat women who had been sitting on their
seven hot slabs.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.


On Goat Hill.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY window commands a view of Goat
Hill. Nature in an idle moment has
designed a slope as a background.
Here you see the animal at its immoral best,
standing on its hind legs nibbling the top
from a hedge, or kneeling adroitly with the
chewing end of its face between the pickets
getting at the root of the matter.
I know every one of these outlaws person-
ally, from the rollicking kids back to the
hoary great-grandparents. They are an in-
teresting and a lovable band, so long as they
patronise, as restaurants, the gardens of
one’s neighbors. I see in them more than
mere goat. The wisdom and benevolence ex-
pressed in the faces of many of the herd has
won me to a belief in the reincarnation of
souls. I recognise many an old identity who
lived long in the municipality and died re-
spected, but now reborn in goat form, is brows-
ing on the hill, backing up to fences id
windy weather, turning up his coat collar, so
to speak, and meditating on the rotten way
local matters have been run since his time.
These reincarnated ones lead a simple, agri-
cultural life on the whole, the dullness of
which is leavened by the firing of unexpected
brickbats over fences, or the joyous stam-
pede from strollers’ dogs on Sundays, or an
occasional gallop to the deserted quarry holes
up beyond. The last-mentioned dissipation
happens on moonlight nights, when paid
assassins, armed with lassos, come in a cor-
poration cart and steal Upon the sleeping
goats, intent on hauling them to the local
pound. Then takes place the wild, tumultu-
ous rush. Faster than the wind go the herd,
patriarchs and kids, matronly “nannies,”
young “billys” in wooden collars —they
nearly all gain the sanctuary of the quarries
and poise on perilous ledges, where the
hlnclier of the corporation laborer can gain
no foothold. The rush is for life, for not
even a patriarch may expect redemption out
of the pound at the cost of a crown piece.
The very goat housed (or arlied) by
Noah herds there. He has never died, and
never will. Grey-bearded, indestructible,
immune from shot or noxious weed, he
chews his immortal way through woodheaps
and rubbish-tips, even as he doubtless chewed
the olive branch when the dove had done
with it. Not only Noah’s goat, but Noah
himself is there in goat form. There is no
mistaking the prophet. Mark his air of
piety, his snowy beard, and knees calloused
as if by much -prayer. He wears a halo, too.
Not the frail thing of vapor worn by the
saints, but a practical thing of rope by which
the sinners who own him to-day tether him
to a stake. To them, not being cursed with
the inner vision, Noah is but a goat. Little
do they know what exalted personage it is
they stable behind the fowlhouse. Noah,
owing to the “I told you so” air he has
adopted since forecasting the Flood, occa-
sionally clashes with King Billy, one of his
own descendants, a black, slant-eyed young
devil with a bass “ba-a-a” and a sprout of
whisker. King Billy is a powerful, self-
opinionated despot, given to painting the
hill red —one who, headed skilfully into your
enemy’s tomato plot, would make history
there. Before him, Noah, veteran and seer,
must perforce ba-a-a diminuendo; other vet-
erans must do the same. One there is, bene-
ficent of aspect, and only needing lawn-
sleeves to convert him into an excellent
bishop. Given a background of crimson vel-
vet and a dim religious light a drowsy
congregation would never know the difference
’twixt him and the high-salaried reality. As
it is, his High Church manner is going to
waste on Goat Hill, with naught but a fol-
lowing off devoted “nannies” and no one to
take round the plate.
Knowing these goats, horn and hoof, it
was with surprise that I noticed among them
a newcomer —a frivolous young feminine
WHERE AUDTEECES WERE SCARCE.
THE CLERIC: “I have no patience with play-
acting. My mission is to save the mis-
guided souls who patronise your shore."
THE ACTOR: “Then, ’fore God, sir, you
haven’t many souls to save in this
town.”
with a white-faced kid sprinting beside her.
She was attached by twenty feet of rope,
which had entwined itself round every pro-
jection on the slope, and, having torn these
from their moorings, was now decorated with
them —pieces of hoop iron, roots of gorse,
somebody’s tea-towel. These the frisky new-
comer trailed after her in and out of the
bishop’s congregation, around the calloused
legs of Mr. Noah. Clearly she was an
escapee, had broken loose somewhere from
constituted authority. Presently Jones came
into view. He lives in the pretentious red
house whose hurricane fence runs clieek-by-
jowl with my own. Debonair, confident, fully
dressed for the city save for his coat, he came
forth to capture and enslave. The escapee
was his. He intended taking that goat by
the horns and milking her. At Jones’s
approach the browsing goats became restless
and herded together. The whisper had been
passed, and the clans, both foreign and
friendly, allied in sheltering the escapee from
the hand of man. Affable .Tones addressed
bis property. “Nan, Nan!” he called. ‘‘Good
old girl!” Nan laid back her ears and eyed
him narrowly. Then, realising what a poor
specimen of a man Jones really was. she
scratched some hair from her back with her
horn and laughed outright. King Billy also
cachinnated contemptuously. The kids giggled,
and even matrons pretended to see the joke.
Noah, who is surly, and the Bishop, who
always recognises Authority before Wit, had
to have the jokes pointed out to them with
King Billy’s horn. Then they laughed enough
for a whole Ark-load of animals. But the
despised Jones, suddenly catching the rope,
succeeded in dragging Nan to his own boun-
daries.
“Fetch the can, dear!” the captor called
to his wife, who promptly appeared with the
desired tin. Jones stood carelessly upon his
goat's rope. “We don't want bailing up, do
we. Nan?” he remarked genially. “We’ll just
milk here. So-oh!” He stroked her ten-
derly. From an adjacent shed came the
bleat of the goat’s first-born, tied up
and robbed of its constitutional rights.
At the pathetic sound the maternal
instinct awoke in Nan. “Ma-ama-aa!”
she called.
“Steady! So-o! Poor old girl!”
Jones was on his burglarious knees
now, stealthily approaching the kid’s
birthright; but ere he could lay hands
on it Nan had left his part of the
country. Quicker than thought and a
lot quicker than Jones, she bounded
away to the very crest of the bill,
with the kid racing beside her. The
rope on which Jones had crouched
had scarified his knees. liis confi-
dence was shaken, and, to my sur-
prise, he swore. Hitherto his vocabu-
lary had contained nothing stronger
than “Bai George!” “Oh. tosh!” and
the like.
Some boy volunteers lured Nan back
with carrots, and a passing expert
suggested a stake at head and heel for
the rebel. This was done. Fastened
fore and aft by leather belts, her side
hitched to a peg, an epicurean meal
set before her, milking looked dead
easy. Again Jones crept, silent as
an Indian, towards his goat’s flank.
Then he made a quick grab. He drew
milk, a thin stream which through his
own bungling took the wrong turning
and splashed on his shirt, front.
The indignant goat baa-ed madly
and lunged and strained at the leather
hands. Her head was fast, but with
a dexterous movement she freed her
hoof and commenced to swing her body
round in half-circles.
Jones rose stiffly from where Nan had
trodden him and let loose a stream of invec-
tive. He had a cold, poisonous look in his
eye, which boded ill for the rebellious animal.
While he cursed he brushed gravel and goat
hair from his garments.
The goat, beset on all sides by would-be cap-
tors, butted and baa-ed. Someone tried to
lasso her hind feet, but it was an impossible
job. Her nimbleness and strength amazed
all the experts present. But at last one
grasped her horns and two others got her
heels, and allowed Jones another chance. lie
advanced, fighting the kid all the way for
first place/ Gingerly he made a start. There
was a faint trickling—Nan’s-first contribu-
tion to the domestic commissariat. It fell
thinly, sometimes into the can, sometimes
into Jones’s eyes, sometimes into the air : for
she kept rocking and swaying, and the loyal
assistants had to surge with her. These
splendid souls, stooping and squatting in
insecure positions, were occasionally thrown
right off their feet bv an extra-violent jump.
Jones won about an egg-cup of milk;
then he unwisely sought to capture a released
hoof and, in order to do so, loosed his hold
on the billy for a second; Nan smartly
placed her hoof in it, drew it out again and
kicked the contents all over the outside of
Jones. Almost at the same moment, Mrs.
Jones got a black eye through leaning down
to coo consolation to the maddened animal.
Her kid gloves —she was dressed to accom-
pany Jones to the station, for they are but
newly wed —she split from top to bottom
while thumping the goat for being so head-
strong. Nan, loose save for her neck-strap,
burst from the group and ran round and
round like an eccentric clown at a circus,
the strap trailing behind till it cut into her
windpipe. Uttering distressing cries, she
plunged right and left, while the neighbors
collected in knots. Distant residents, hear-
ing the heart-rending sounds, surveyed Jones
through field-glasses and talked about the
Animals’ Life Protection Act.
But brute strength must ever succumb to
the science of man. Willing hands impro-
vised for the recalcitrant milker a small bail.
There is some old fencing round Jones’s
back door, and, by removing one of the pickets
and adding a length or two of hardwood, the
milking-place was soon complete. Once her
head was through the fence and the loose
picket shot home, she would be pinned there
and must surely capitulate.
There was a stay of proceedings while the
luscious lure was arranged within the bail.
False endearments were then showered upon
the stubborn and suspicious brute. Her
crown was scratched by fingers itching to
throttle her.
Jones, unhinged and with bloodshot eyes,
leant against the fence. He had a singing
in his ear where the milkcan had hit him.
Absently he picked more goat’s hair from his
vest and nerved himself to resume the battle.
The dirty boy-volunteers from the woodyard
bled loyally for their Jones, one from the
nose, the other from the foot, where, his shoe
being minus an upper, the goat had trampled
on if. The billy was dented and would
never stand upright again. The useless on-
lookers offered advice at a safe distance.
Nan’s appetite presently needing a stay,
she came forward and, to the joyous surprise
of all, entered the bail of her own accord.
Quick hands shot the pickets into position
and tied her legs to stakes. Milking was re-
sumed in haste. But the goat, not to be
outdone by these tactics, at the first thievish
pinch of Jones’s fingers promptly sat down
upon her dairy department. Shouts, kicks,
endearments were all in vain. With legs
crumpled up under her and face placidly
dining, she sat firmly upon her milk.
Jones fell against the fence with beads of
perspiration upon his forehead and asked
Heaven what he had done to be thus treated
by a goat. While lie was still talking to
Providence about it Nan was yanked to her
feet and, before she could collapse again,
some genius neatly ran Mrs. Jones’s beaded
music-stool under her middle. This man-
oeuvre certainly kept her upright, but it also
kept Jones from the milk. Lifted high
iu the centre Nan looked rather like the
insignia of the Golden Fleece. The music-
stool, since it cut off Jones’s approach, was
presently hauled from under and, after slid-
ing the can into position, he was just about
to try again when the animal re-seated her-
self. This time the outlook was particularly
hopeless, for that part of the goat’s anatomy
which contained the milk fitted snugly into
the can and was, therefore, quite inaccess-
ible. Then the perverse brute was found to
be black in the face and choking through
the bail being too tight. Kind hands re-
moved the picket and the goat withdrew her
horns from bondage; but the milk depart-
ment was still firmly wedged in the billy.
Nan stood more or less at ease while some
genius suggested a tin-opeffer.
Just at this stage Mr. Jabez Oakey, pro-
minent citizen, councillor and candidate for
the mayoral bed-gown, trotted into view. He
pulled up his fat pony at the sight of the
turmoil at Jones’s, descended from the
muddy gig and pottered fussily across the
hillside. He smiled broadly at the situation.
“Goats.” he said, “is ticklish things. I’m
s’prised at a man in a tlirivin' way o' busi-
ness like you, Jones, goin’ in for ’em.”
“Fad of the wife’s,” explained Jones apa-
thetically. “ ‘Goat's milk for gourmands,'
—that new craze, y’ know.”
Here the councillor lifted his hat rever-
ently to Mrs. .Tones upon the verandah. For
Mrs. Jones was young and pretty and Jabez
was far from cold.
“Well, they’re a uoosance, any'ow—a noo-
sance to th’ ratepayers, uprootin’ their
'edges, gettin' into flower beds, an’ so on.
Doin’ no end o' damage. Oh. o’ course
you’ll please yourself about keepin' it.
Jones! But, mind yer, th’ uoosance in-
spector’s makin' a raid up ’ere on Goat 'll!
first night th' moon’s at th’ full. ( Mornin',
Mrs. Jones! Yes, you’re quite right—it is
a disgraceful name for a locality this
’ere, with nice ’ouses bein’ erected an' all.
It oughter be named ‘Th’ Crescent’ or ‘Gar-
den Grove’—somethin’ sylvan or a bit fancy
—better fer the land sales, y’ know.) I What!
Ain’t yer able t’ milk ’er, Jones? I bet yer
7 could ! ’Ere! Why don’t yer put 'er ’end
in th’ bail?”
“Oh, it’s too small, Mr. Oakey! It's
cruelty to animals; the poor tiling nearly
choked.”
“Ar, you’ve got a tender ’eart!” mur-
mured Mr. Oakey, leering greasily. “Ar.
but I like to see it in the ladies!” lie leered
again gallantly, and the enraged Jones be-
gan to wonder which he hated the most —
goat or councillor. “Seems big enough,”
resumed Oakey, remeasuring the bail with
a bilious eye. “She ain’t too thunderin' big.
Did you put ’er ’ead in square, .Tones?"
Jones’s reply to this was quite unprint-
able. To soothe him his wife suggested
whisky, and the trio repaired to the back
verandah to drink it. In order to avoid fur-
ther publicity, the goat was dragged inside
the fence. Thus the setting for the last act
was changed.
Meanwhile the whisky was doing its
work. Jones, liis empty glass in his hand,
liis eyes narrowed to malignant slits, com-
menced a silent conversation in the lan-
guage of the eye with the insurrectionist
whose milk he wanted —telling her how
much he wished to be in a small walled-in
place, alone—quite alone —with her and a
gun.
He was roused from savage day-dreams
by the voice of the councillor bragging reck-
lessly. “Milk! I could milk ’er all right!
Many’s tlf goat I’ve tamed, before moonici-
pal matters tamed me! Har, liar! Not bad.
eh? No, Mrs. Jones! Proud is not the name
of Jabez Oakey, though ’e ’as got a ’ead on
’im ! Yes, I’ve got on a bit —there’s many
a one who snubbed me when I didn't ’ave a
jingle in me pocket as is proud to shake
’ands with me now!”
Jones cursed him jealously under his
breath, and, grabbing the yard broom, _ ad-
vanced softly towards the highly suspicious
goat. He carefully averted his gaze from
the doomed animal, hoping thereby to put
if off its guard.
Now the Jones's votes as ratepayers
numbered four. Well worth working for.
Jabez thought. Full of neighborly solici-
tude, he bent down and surveyed the bail
at close quarters. “Ought ter be big
enough, allowin’, that is, fer ’er ’orns.
Allowin’ fer ’er ’orns,” he repeated, and
dropped to his hands and knees. With hiss
paunch scraping the gravel he advanced liis
little round bullet head experimentally to-
ward the bail and then through it.
The watchful eye of the waiting Jones,
who hadn’t dared to turn completely round,
saw something bulky approach the bail. “Ah
lia, you brute! At last! At last!!” he
hissed. Without turning liis head, he
brought round the yard-broom and waited.
“Ought ter be big enough,” mumbled the
unconscious councillor, 'on his hands and
knees. Then, as he wagged his foolish head
iu measurement, some dastardly hand shot
down the picket and the future Mayor of
Gardentown was bailed up like a cow. Mrs.
Jones screamed a warning, but Jones, with
an almightly swing, brought round the
broom. Thud! Bash!! Bump!!! Bestial
howls of rage blended with the shrieks of
Mrs. Jones. There was a sudden rush of
feet and the blindly furious Jones was
swept aside by neighbors who had poured
over his fence. A scene of fury followed.
Jones waved the broom at the goat in
attempted explanation. All in vain. The

victim denounced him ungrammatically as a
cold-blooded assassin, and then was hoisted
by the entire assemblage to his gig. The
dazed Jones listened helplessly to a torrent
of threats, and leant heavily on the broom
like a stricken standard-bearer while the
dirty trap and the old lunatic bumped away
on the rise.
Upon the summit of the hill he could
see his animal grazing. The now bottom-
less can was being worn coquettishly as an
anklet; and beneath her was the kid enjoy-
ing its belated supper.

BALCKBOY.
A Perished Memory.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I T had been a strenuous night for Arthur.
As assistant chief steward of the
Annual Ball Committee of the Harbors
and Havens Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., he
had been an extremely busy young man. The
occasion had been graced by the presence
of Miss Rosalie Towns and her father,
John Towns, M.L.C., a director of the
company, who, “at great personal incon-
venience to himself, had come all the way
from Sydney to be present among them that
evening.”
The chairman of the Ball Committee said
so at supper when proposing the health of
their director, Mr. John Towns, coupled
with that of Miss Rosalie Towns, both of
THE WORRY OF IT.
MR. YOUNGWED: “Why, you’ve had your own
way ever since we’ve been married.”
MRS. YOUNGWED: “Yes, but I didn’t expect
to have so much trouble about it."
whom they hoped to see among them on
many future occasions of a similar character.
Thunders of applause and the singing of
“He’s” (or She’s) “a jolly good fell —o,” the
substitution of the feminine pronoun being
considered a brilliant stroke of almost devil-
ish wit among the younger male vocalists.
Mr. Towns rose heavily to his feet and
ponderously declared that he would have
allowed nothing to stand between him and his
purpose to be present at such a notable
gathering. A gathering which he ventured
to say exhibited to the full the loyalty and
the friendliness which —in spite of cramping
legislation, and without the interference of
Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts—ex-
isted ; and he, for one. hoped would con-
tinue to exist between the employees of the
Harbors and Havens Steam Navigation Com-
pany, Limited, and their Board of Manage-
ment, of which he had the honor and the
privilege to" be president. (Loud applause.)
He complimented them on their well-being,
and assured them of Ins keen personal sym-
pathy--a sympathy which occasions like the
present tended to fan into active expression
—a sympathy that was more than a mere
WHO'S WHO.
SHE: “That bald-headed man is Dobson, the great composer."
HE: “A composer, did you say?"
SHE: “Yes; manufactures soothing-syrup."
business interest —a sympathy that for ever
kept the door of his office and the door of
his heart open to them at all times and on
all occasions. He was proud of this oppor-
tunity to meet them on a common level—to
eat with them —to drink with them, and only
that he had no desire to stand m the way of
younger men —to dance with them. (Hearty
cheers.) But, for this part of the programme
he had, with admirable foresight, although he
said so himself, provided a proxy—his daugh-
ter (universal tumult) —whose name they
had honored with his own in the toast they
had just so enthusiastically drunk.
(Cheers, shrieks, yells, and other
manifestations of unrestrained de-
light.)
Rosalie averaged about three
partners to every dance after that.
Arthur’s turn didn’t come till about
two o’clock in the morning, when
Rosalie was so tired that she sug-
gested sitting it out, if he didn’t
mind.
Arthur didn’t. Not that he
knew much about the etiouette of
the sat-out waltz, but he knew
enough to lead her to a secluded
corner of the verandah where....
It is impossible to explain how it
happened: but for five maddening
minutes, obsessed by some marvel-
lous influence, he had held her in
his arms and kissed her passion-
ately. And she had kissed him,
oblivious of the fact that she was a
magnate’s daughter and he but the
humblest of the great man’s slaves.
To be precise, he was a junior
shipping-clerk.
The subsidence of the voluptuous
strains of the “Blue Danube”
broke the spell, and he returned
the young lady to her papa. The
memory of the golden experience
clothed him for the moment in an
armor of splendid audacity.
Surely no common destiny was his? Who
of all the Harbors and Havens Steam. Navi-
gation Company’s servants had been beatified
like him? Not even the resplendent commo-
dore of the fleet, Captain Joss, whose atten-
tions the barmaid of the Harbors and Havens
Hotel accepted in a spirit of prideful thank-
fulness. Before him lay a dazzling avenue of
success that led up to a managing-direc-
tor’s chair, towards which article of furni-
ture he marched to the bewildering music of
wedding bells. In the intoxication of the
moment he almost slapped Mr. Towns on
the shoulder and called him dad.
Then the confounded band played “God
Save the King,” and started the rush for
coats and wraps; the search for fans that
had been dropped and scarves that had been
mislaid; the rooting out of the half-muddled
chaps who had spent their time at the bar
or dropped their brass at the card-tables;
the mollifying of the sleepily-snappy wives
who wanted to get home; and the mustering
of their unnaturally wakeful progeny who
were stealing a few extra moments of delight
beyond range of chaperonic vision. Mr.
Towns’s motor was waiting to convey him to
his hotel some forty chains away. The Mayor
and other , big guns escorted him in a body
as far as the gutter, accompanied by a re-
splendent opera-cloak, within which was con-
cealed the charms of the recently kissed
Rosalie.
Arthur hovered, expectant of nothing but
hopeful of everything, on the outskirts of the
crowd. As assistant chief steward —the duties
of chief steward included the opening of the
door of the Towns’s car —he had to see the
hall emptied of its last reveller.
There were two of them, and they attached
themselves to Arthur and chronicled their
small beer to him, assuming that lie should
be interested in their trivial intrigues—he,
whose soul brimmed with Five Oceans of
Bliss, and who for Five Cycles of Delight
had held all the Joys of Earth and Heaven
in the hollow of his right arm; and had
kissed it on the lips, on the eyes, the cheeks,
the chin, the throat, and knew that It—the
Incarnation of Ideal Femininity—had kissed
him.
Not only were these pettifogging revellers
garrulous, but they were unsteady on their
legs, and clung to Arthur, partly for support
and partly that he might judge between them
of their respective ways with a woman—he,
the gaberlunzie who had cuddled the King’s
Daughter—bidding him make accompt of
their brass farthings, after he had handled
ruby, diamond and topaz richer than those
that adorn the breasts of the Seraphim.
Before the rose of dawn
made glorious all the east,
he broke from them and
locked himself into his own
bedroom. They stumbled
noisily on to the verandah,
and bursting open his win-
dow tried to finish their
tales.
It was a small window,
not wide enough for two
petitioners, therefore there
was much wrangling, and
the dressing-table fell with
a loud crash, and —porten-
tous happening—broke the
mirror. This aroused the
landlady, who set the dog
on the intruders, and the
faithful animal chased them
out of the mist-laden town-
ship. She remained and
impressed upon Arthur the
fact that she was a respect-
able woman even if she did
keep boarders, and also that
she held him responsible for
(he wreckage of her priceless
furniture.
_ From the far river-flats came an occa-
sional yell, mingled with the yelp of the
family hound. On the other side of a
matchboard partition, the landlady chanted
her woes in an inharmonious monotone.
Arthur flung himself on his bed to live again
the ineffable happiness which he had experi-
enced. when somebody hammered at his door
and _ he opened his eyes to see the sun
blazing in at his window and hear the post
office clock striking eight.
Sheol!
Work started at eight and the Harbors
and Havens Steam Navigation Company’s
worst tub, the Platypus, was lying at the
wharf to load for Sydney. He sluiced the
sleep from his eyes at the yard tank in five
seconds; he dressed and ate his breakfast
in five minutes and set out to lower the
record for the 500yds. that lay between him
and the wharf.
There was an unusual crowd at the door
of the Harbors and Havens Hotel where
Rosalie and Mr. Towns rested. Two troopers
stood at the door. A guard of honor, opined
Arthur: she was worth it.
Mr. Towns appeared on the verandah
with an overcoat on over his pyjamas and
called , the assemblage “an undisciplined mob
of ungrateful rascals.”
On the strength of the managing direc-
tor’s sentiments of the previous evening, the
wharfies of the Harbors and Havens Com-
pany had asked for “another bob a day.”
Mr. Towns was righteously indignant.
To take advantage of his supper-table
generosity was to hold a pistol at the Head
of Industry. He said so, in almost so many
words. lie also told them to go to the
Devil. They cheered and hooted him and
went to the opposition pub—a low-down
shanty whose beer-glasses were supposed to
be larger than those of the hotel patronised
by Mr. Towns. As a matter of fact they
were only 1 bicker.
The local manager marshalled his office
staff, recruited a few volunteers from the
small capitalists of Ihe crowd, and leading
them to the ship’s side, set them embarking
pigs. Arthur was relegated to the bowels
of the Platypus—he who for five Eternities
had —never mind; he was now in a mal-
odorous dungeon watching squealing swine
swoop down on him through a hole in a
ship’s deck.
He had no leisure for reminiscence.
There were no smoke-ohs, and when dinner-
time came he was too hungry to realise his
weariness. But when he had finished eat-
ing ho woijld re-enact in all its details the
Five —surely that succession of short
whistles didn’t mean bucking in again V
It did. Arthur bucked in; under an aval-
anche of pigs.
At knock-off-time he was too tired to
know how hungry he was, so he sat down
in the lee of the wheel-house and let his
bones ache. His head slipped on one side
and cricked his neck. When he woke it
was quite dark and In; was half frozen. The
silence of the night was broken only by the
grunt of uneasy pigs and their penetrating
smell —a smell so pungent that he could not
sense the delicate odor exhaled by Rosalie
Towns as for Five —! More sleep ! Then
five o’clock and the ship’s cook, with a
pannikin of hot coffee in his fist, kicking
him in the ribs with five naked, stubby
toes and calling him “a blessed blackleg.”
The phrase hurt his feelings; the cook’s
toes had bruised his ribs; the hot pannikin
burnt his lips; the coffee, abominably bitter
and innocent of milk, scalded his throat.
He chucked the kit overboard and went
below to stack pigs until midday.
When the last swine was shipped they
headed the boat for Sydney with Arthur
still on board. Once over the bar the ele-
ments conspired against them, and Arthur
was so energetically seasick that he was
unable to decide whether he should let him-
self slide overboard or wait until the ship
sank. But, once ashore and refreshed by a
good sleep, he would live it all over again.
Item: the dark verandah corner and the
two squeaky fiddles and the tinny piano.
Item: the soft, sinuous form, the question-
ing grey eyes, the lips that kissed, the arms
that clung. Item: the fate that on the day
of the Harbors and Havens strike sent him
to sea in a leaky boat, in the teeth of a
howling gale, with a cargo of stinking
Gadarene swine.
At Pyrmont they set him tallying the live
stock. Some of it was dead, and he had to
tally that too.
A Glebe-islander hit him on the nose for
being a “scab,” and he fell off the break of
the poop and lay unconscious for a time.
But he recovered to make the return trip
in the hooker with a few cases of assorted
merchandise and the smell of the departed
pigs.
The trip down was little better than the
trip up. He ached all over. Both his eyes
were black, and the back of his head was
extremely painful. He could think of
nothing, not even of his woes.
When the Platypus bumped the river
wharf again, the treasurer of the Ball
Committee tapped him for 12s. 6d. for his
ticket. Mr. Towns and his daughter had
been gone nearly a week. The industrial
trouble was settled. How, Arthur never

she had hugged him.
Before he was properly rested he had

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Bad Australian”: The Australian bush-
man, with all his experience in the matter
of saddles built for comfort and efficiency,
can still learn something from the S. Ameri-
can gaucho. When that party goes out on a
mustering or droving expedition he climbs into
a contraption like a packsaddle, fitted with
pommel and cantle of equal height, the hol-
low in the centre, which varies from about a
foot to 15in. in depth, being covered with
several rough-tanned sheep-, goat-, or
guanaco-skins and the owner’s ponchos. A
poncho is a gaudy-colored, rough, hand woven
blanket with a hole punched in the centre.
Through this the gaucho claps his head, and
is then considered to be in order for any full-
dress function in S. American outback
society. The ponchos are piled on top of the
skins, and when a double cinch is passed
over the lot the expedition is ready to start.
The double cinch (the surcingle) is rigged
so that one circumnavigates the prad in the
ordinary way, and the other passes about
half-way between the brisket and the stifle
joint. With an animal cinched up in this
way nothing short of starvation or a change
oc Government will shift the navigator. When
the outfit gets into camp o’ nights the hollow-
backed saddle is put on the ground and used

as a pillow, the sheepskins are spread as
“hippers” and to evade the moisture from
the cold, cold ground ; one poncho is put on
as a nightie, and the other is rolled round
the crossbred descendant of Pizarro. Then
he is happy. What pleases me about the
gaucho is that it forms part of the saddle,
unlike the unsightly swag held on the pom-
mel by a precarious assortment of D’s and a
couple of sheepskin saddle-straps. As for
comfort the old Waega tvne of stock-saddle,
or even one of old Christy Higgins’s buck-
jump and round-up saddles, ai’e not, nor ever
were, a circumstance compared with it. 1
have sampled both kinds of goods, and the
only rock I have to heave at the gaucho’s
outfit is that when he pulls it to pieces for
the night it makes a bloke feel like a whole
community—he feels he ought to be pro-
claimed a township within the meaning of
the Act, and that a bunch of Jaypees and
a Road Board should be constituted and
appointed forthwith.
“Te Whare”: The preference shown by
satin bower-birds for decorations of a blue
color requires explanation. I had a bower
under close observation for over six months,
and throughout the birds kept faithfully to
a dominant color-note —blue of various
shades, from the bright sky-blue of blue-
bags filched from adjacent laundries to the
pm pi e-blue of nightshade blossoms. Blue-
bags were particularly favored. One irate
proprietress recovered several of hers, but
the satin-birds managed to steal as many
more. Scraps of dark blue glass from
broxen castor-oil bottles, blue-mack tail
feathers from the crimson parrot, and large
blossoms from the blue-flag or iris were
favorite decorations. A settler finding that
satin-birds were devouring his peas as fast

as they podded, rigged a spring trap baited
with pink rose petals, put not a bird came
near it. I hung scraps of red rag on twigs
near his bower, but they too remained un-
touched. The only noticeable variation
from the chosen color-scheme consisted in
a scrap of snake skin, some pale yellow
jonquil blossoms and the skull of a young
duck. Over a miie distant from my bower
a black satin-bird was observed looking over
the flowers in a bush-garden of roses, mari-
golds, periwinkles, etc. —reds, yellows and
blues. He plumped for periwinkle blossoms
—sky-blue in shade —and flew home with
his spoil.

“Hay” : Among the Centralian abos. many
different kinds of bush were employed in
smoke signalling. One in particular—a
peculiar, strong-smelling, sticky kind of
shrub, which bushmen knew as balsam and
Binghi called “boonti”—threw up a straight
black column of smoke that was easily dis-
tinguished. This was used
solely to intimate to the hunt-
ing members of the tribe that
a death had occurred in camp.
On its appearance they would
instantly return home. The
abo. who had raised the smoke
would be the one who had been
told off to look after the sick
party. Arming himself with
shield and waddy he would
advance to meet the hunters,
who as they arrived would aim
blows at him with their
weapons. If he succeeded in
parrying all their kind atten-
tions and escaped unhurt, he
was considered to be free from
all blame in connection with
the sick person’s death, and
was allowed to take part in
the funeral festivities without
a stain on his character. What
ignominy he would have had
to suffer had he failed to evade
their clubs and boomerangs I
can’t say, because he always
came out scathless; so perhaps it was a mere
form.
* * * *
“Russell”: Years ago my father was run-
ning a hawking-van round about Hergott
Springs (S.A.) and I used to go with him
for company. One day we set out from the
Springs with a van-load of stuff, including
two small kegs of beer, for a boring camp
four days’ journey nor’-west. The water
tank was slung on the back of the van. The
drought was at its worst, the poor old neddies
were fit to drop any second, and the flies
were terrible. About two days out we dis-
covered that the fastenings had broken and
the water tank had dropped off. The horses
couldn’t have lasted a day without a drink,
so we struck back along the road. After
coin a 1 about three miles we found the tank
lying in the sandy track, side up and empty.
There we were, two days from water in
either direction, me crying for a drink, and
the horses with their tongues hanging out,
while the “old man” was nearly off his head.
In desperation he knocked in the plug-hole
of one of the kegs of beer, and gave me a
pannikin of it. Then he put aside a bucket-
ful for further use, and, knocking in the top
of the keg, gave the horses their turn. They
sniffed the liquor several times and then
buried their noses and guzzled. The “old
man” in a few moments tried to drag them
away, but they were determined to see the
thing through. I remember that sight as
plainly as if it happened yesterday—the two
horses watching us with their eyes just show-
ing above the top of the keg. and flicking
flies off themselves with their tails, while
my father danced round wringing his hands
and with big tears streaming out of his eyes.
“All me profits gone !” he moaned again and
again. The beer affected each beast differ-
ently. Nancy, the old black mare, wanted to
fall down and sleep it off. The other nag
went mad, and pulled Nancy and the van
along at a marvellous pace. There was no-
thing else for it, so next day those horses
got the other keg of beer, and then both
of them were dead drunk—Nancy all the
time quivering at the knees and lurching
about with a silly grin on her face. If it
hadn’t been for the other prad we’d never
have reached our destination. Hie rattled
along just as if it was a cold day in winter.
“Werrimee”: The making of boomerangs
is rapidly becoming a lost art among the
semi-civilised aborigines, principally through
the introduction of modern weapons and
white man’s food. The boomerangs sold to
curio collectors are nothing like those the
blackfellow made to fight hostile neighbors
and get tucker. In the old days when
stousli was in the air the reignmg monarch
and his grand vizier, the medicine man,
issued a proclamation that every warrior
w r as expected to do his duty and make
boomerangs. They worked early and they
worked late, squatting on the grotind, shap-
ing ttie weapons with sione tomahawks and
paring them down with sharp shells and
stones. They stacked them in gredt heaps,
and the Archbishop consecrated them with
appropriate remarks and a full set of whis-
kers. The boomerangs were of all shapes
and sizes, according to the raw material and
the limitations of the artisans’ tools. There
was the big double-handed boomerang with
which the President of the Wyangaree
Republic subjugated his enemy at close
quarters; the long wopden sword with
which he smote him hip and thigh and like-
wise cranium ; the light, sharp-ended whizzer
that disorganised the internal machinery of
Bungawalbyn’s infantry at long range; the
come-here-whoa boomerang which flew- past
the opposing battalion, and then circled
back and attacked General Wombat in the
rear; the liook boomerang, designed to hang
on the defender’s weapon or shield, and spin,
so as to fetch him a sharp welt with the
flying end ; and the carved boomerang, upon
which the native artist displayed his deco-
rative genius. There was also the cross
boomerang, called yalma and pirbu-pirbu
(N.Q.? ; there were barbed and glass-
pointed spears, woomeras, yam sticks,
waddies, nulla-nullas, and heilamons. The
nulla is a skull-smashing club that was made
more effective af f er the advent of the pio-
neers. Then hobnails were extracted from
blueher boots, and the nobby end of the
implement studded with them. Many a
poor shepherd was assassinated in the old
days for the ironmongery he walked on.
Murri wasn’t in the habit of trading boom-
erangs then, or he might have exchanged a
few of inferior brand for hobnails, as he
does to-day for ’bacca and rum.

“Barcoo” : Mustering and droving? This is
how Chilcote. then a well-known overlander,
did it during the ’9l str ; ke. Th» Queensland
station-hands were called oui the day he
camped near Adavale with 1000 bullocks on
the way to N. S. Wales. The strike camp
cajoled away all his hards, and he was left
with two cattle-dogs. With no other help he
pushed through to Charleville, on the Warre-
go, a journey of 120 miles, without the loss
of a hoof. By that time the strike committee
decided to allow drovers’ hands to continue
work. When his share of them rolled up
Chilcote went to sleep for a week.
"Silas Snell" : It is not always a lobster.
Buller, during the course of long whisky
quest, came into possession of a large, nude
turkey. Immediately afterwards he lost all
friends, and became detached from the co-
operative party that had hitherto aided and
abetted his jag. A large, soberly-clad citi-
zen affectionately nursing an , undraped
turkey of 2olb. is no fit companion for souls
sensitive to public ridicule. Buller bad to
go Home alone. He went along Prince-street,
cuddling his great fleshly turkey in his arms
as if it were a child of his own and the joy
of ins declining years. The head hung from
his left elbow on half a yard of neck, the
last section over the fence abutted from
under his right arm, and Buller sang softly
to his treasure. Locking down the road, his
hat on the back of his head, his watch dang-
ling, and a patch of mud on each knee from
the last praying-bee in East-sireet, he lisped
a lullaby. In Park-street Buller was carry-
ing the naked bird over his shoulder, cling-
ing unfeelingly to its head, rocking much
more heavily, and carolling a wilder stave.
A fox terrier sprang at the turkey's Cape of
Good Hope, and hung on. The crowd
cheered the cb.g. Buller noticed nothing,
and sang along. Turning into Sandgate-
terrace Buller was leading his raw bird
from a cord tethered to its neck. It was
here or hereabout that Buller confused the
issue somewhat. He would stbp every 20
yards or so, and address affectionate and
encouraging remarks to the shorn gobbler.
“Good boy !” he said. “Good boy!” and he
patted the turkey encouragingly. Then he
made enticing noises through his lips, and
sa'd “Here, boy! Here, boy!” Occasion-
ally he turned, and whistled, and flipped his
fingers. He seemed delighted with the suc-
cess of his efforts. “Whatid I teller?” he
said. “Whatid I teller? Didn’ I say ’twas
easy t’ teachem t’ fuller? Comelong, ole
boy,” and Buller passed on, towing the
stripped turkey home. In Beach-street
Buller had two trams bailed up, and was
surrounded by a large crowd of men, women,
children, perambulators and bakers’ carts.
He was sitting flat on the tram track, the
fox terrier was noisily and angrily worrying
the turkey, and Buller was talking. “Leavem
’Lne,” said Buller. “Leavem ’lone. Lettem
fio'h’tout. Can’t yer lettem figh’tout! I’ll
(h!c!? better ouid on the goose!” Later the
L'v-terrier had the turkey. A policeman had
Buller.

risking his immortal soul state which is the

TRUCKIN'.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I've trucked Below nine ’undred feet, with just a

Down there where candles smoke, ’alf choked, in
fumes of gelignite;
Along the rusty rails I’ve pushed trucks loaded up
with ore,
An' shoved 'em empty hark again an’ filled ’em up
once more,
Through slush an’ damp an’ grey mine mud, an’
coppered water green,
By rotten wooden uprights where the jag-tooth side-

An’ you can ’ear the scurry of the ’ungry, ’alf-

But I was brought up to it, an’ I don’ feel no
remorse,
for if you get 'ini used to it a man will be a
’orse
Pulling, pushing at ’is truck,
Pushing birder when it s stuck,
Swearing ’ardest at ’is luck ;
If you only bring ’im up that way a man will be

I've trucked above, by way of change, an’ shoved

An’ spilled the load out at the end an’ ’card it roll

I mustn’t let the work get choked, I mustn’t take

So every truck the cage swings up I’ve got to get
away;
There's times they run me easy, but more often
there’s a spurt,
An’ boots wear out like paper, an’ the sweat soaks

Oh, the plain is barren, with skies above her
As bare and barren as skies may be;
But she seems in her greyness, to eyes that love her,
More fair than the gardens that fringe the sea.
They may sing of their parks and their gardened
spaces,
Of smiling orchards and shaven lawns,
But give me the width of the wild, waste places
Where the sunsets bloom and the gold day dawns.
And the faint far range in the distance showing
Seems a wondrous thing when the warm day dies
In a glory of gold and crimson glowing'—
Ilis funeral pyre in the western skies.
Bright are the tracks that the rovers travel
And strange are the tales by the rovers told;
But the riddle of life I’d as soon unravel
On the tracks that run to the ranges old.
Sweetheart o’ mine, we have crossed them often
Ere dawns have broken or shades have flown,
And I’ve watched the face of the ranges soften
With a light as tender as flushed your own.
But we’ll ride no move as we oft have ridden,
Stirrup to stirrup ’neath kindly skies.
Ih the city’s maze you are gulfed and hidden,
And the city sorrow has dimmed your eyes.
But I'd ask one boon—when the bells are ringing
And veils are sundered and dreams come true,
Just one long dawn with the magpies singing,
And an endless ride to the range with you.
AUSTRALIA.

OH for one taste of Mary Chandler’s

One glimpse of Mary’s eyes,

Oh, just to feel her tresses on my brow !

Oh, just to see the shimmer of her silk,
A little satin shoe,
Out here where swarthy Abdul and his ilk
Like turban’d ghosts go through.
Oh, just to hear the echoes of that voice

Ah, then ungrudgingly would I rejoice
In realms 1 used to know.
But far beyond my longing does she dwelfcr
Ear she is part of Heaven—and lof Hell!
Oh, just to see her fingers press the keys,

Oh, just to stroll again beside the seas,
The esplanades along.

The Splash that Kate Made.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ABOUT thrift and de monish. '/The
Maori’s troubles !
_ i = ,-4f.
Kate, lGst. and two yards rquind,
had sold her land, and, wit|i £2OOO ifr. te
pank, was feeling kapai, otherwise pretty
good. Came along to the store one day after
having a fling round for a week or two,/and
told me she w r anted some furniture.
“What for, Kate?” /
“Oh, for te whare. Me live all same te
pakeha.”
Good business. Showed her a catalogue
and she at once picked an escritoire, price ,15
guineas. This was all right, but just then
Kate’s roving eye sighted a fresh case of
tinned fish. She at once demanded a couple
of dozen tins, and went off to te whare carry-
ing the spoil in her skirt, looped up in
front.
It was a somewhat stouter Kate who came
in next day for more fish—“by golly that te
kapai kai.” This time the furniture order
was completed—inlaid kauri and honeysuckle
bedroom suite, elaborate brass and mother-
of-pearl bedstead, hand-painted ware, Doul-
ton vases, Axminster carpet square, linen.
All this for Kate’s “bedroom” (10 x 8), where
she had hitherto slept on the floor, among
flax, ti-tree and horse covers. Dining-room
suite, sideboard, mirrors, pictures—Kate
went on putting a forefinger as big as a Ger-
man sausage on the most outstanding illus-
tration revealed by each page of the cata-
logue.
It was a thumping fine order, and, allow-
ing a bit for myself and liberally calculating
railage and cartage—4B miles —to the village,
I made out a bill for £035 2s. Old. Kate
never turned a hair. She w r ent off to te
NEVER MIND ABOUT FATHER!
“But, dear, it develops the lungs.”
“But, darling, it destroys the temper!”
wharo, came back with a cheque book, and
gave me a slip for the full amount, after
much laborious panting over her awful signa-
ture. She then bought a dozen or so of
smoked barracouta, and rolled happily out.
Of course I sent the order away to Auck-
land, and the astonished warehouseman tele-
graphed an urgent inquiry to know if I was
sober. That being set right, the goods were
duly packed, shipped by steamer, then picked
up by the railway, loaded on the waggons,
and at last, after the 48 miles’ pull over
most dreadful roads, dumped down in the
paddock containing Kate’s whare. The
cases made a huge pile and the sweating
teamsters moved off towards the stables, in
profane thankfulness, for boxed-up furni-
ture makes bad loading on those roads.
The cases sway like the Devil.
Kate had a contingent of relations, men,
women and piccaninnies, staying with her
just then. They’d come along to help eat
SAMPLES.
HER HUSBAND : “Repecca, ven you come out
doan’dt shtay on de peach, hut run in
undt dress quick. Aarondson, who
bought dem costumes, is uniting up dere
to see if your dress rill shrink.”
up the proceeds of the land sale. A motor-
car had been brought through from Wan-
ganui, the Lord only knows how; and in
this contraption parties of brown brother
and sister went careering round the district
from Beersheba to Dan. The shover looked
happier every day. We at the store had
secured fresh supplies of food and drapery
and did a roaring trade. Two phonographs
were workine overtime. A seedy-looking
drummer had booked an order for a pianola,
but of this or him nothing more was heard,
nor of the ten quid he got as deposit.
On the day all these eases of furniture
came, Kate and the rest of them were sitting
about smoking and yarning, eating and
drinking, waiting aimlessly for the car, sent
off.-earlier with kai and visitors to old
Matuki’s place down near the ancient Mato-
puhiri clearing. You know how the Maori
lay.es when well fed for a few weeks—the
women near the vhare, the men over near
the tumbledown buggy shod, in the sun. The
teams pulled up and the cases were toppled
over. Kate and her friends took no more
notice of the arrival than a European
would of the milkman. Kate had told them
what was coming. They couldn’t eat a
wardrobe or sideboard. So that was the
end of it. “Taihoa!” said Kate. “I fix
’em up ’nother time.” Just' then the car
came back. Buzz, petrol and joyfulness
filled the air for the rest of the day.
Lord knows what they did all the time.
Kate had drawn her balance in gold and
paid spot cash for everything at the pub,
the store and at the step to the irresistible
motor. Still the cases of furniture lay squat
and weather-stained in the paddock. At last
one day I was in the pub talking to old
Barney Goruff, the owner, when Charlie,
the shover, whose car stood outside,’ came-
into the bar. Remarking that he'
supposed he still owed a couple for
board he planked down two
sovereigns, and with a “Well, so
long,” made out to the car. “Hi-
ehoa!” a running Maori called.
“Come for te ride! Kate sell Tun
more land soon.” “Oh, go to Hell!”
was the reply, and with a burr and
honk-honk of warning to the coach
the car bumped off to the southern
road. Kate’s land had gone, the
money had gone. That was the
end of the section. The shover had
tumbled to the position at once. In
a day or two the relatives started
into the bush to look for their
horses. Within a week they had
left us, making off towards Atio-
mahi, Waiorio, Matatiki and other
places whence they came.
A .week or two later I went away
to civilisation, and did not retufn
till about two months later. It
was my habit to sleep in rooms
behind the shop and feed at the
pub by weekly contract. On going-
in for my first meal after returning
I saw, shining in the frowsy little
dining-room, an ornate sideboard
of the kind affected in the more
pretentious suburbs. It was the
sideboard of Kate’s choice, had cost
her one way and another every
shilling of £6O, and Goruff had got
it for a sack of potatoes and half
a roll of bacon! This I learned
from Maggie, the cook-general-
waitress, as she served up the
sausages I had brought home in a
bag. Goruff told me the rest later
on over, a whisky, and when I
expostulated with him about the
deal said, “Blime, wot’s the good
of the thing to me?” No use of
course. The thing was a shrieking incon-
gruity. lie offered it for a quid and I
didn’t buy.
We finished our drink ; then Goruff went
on in his queer vernacular (I think he was
Cockney-born and had been by turn seaman,
fireman and bush cook before a half-caste
woman drew him into the hinterland for
good) : —■
“Kate did it all in to me and you. That
shover was lifting fifty a week if he got a
deener. And wot we didn’t get some of
those spongin’ cows borrowed. Old Matuki
came over about er week ago and-’ad a
kofero. Then they ’ad the boxes ripped up,
and lor-lumme I went dow r n and ’ad er look.
Furniter, straw and packin’ canvas all over
ther bloomin’ place. Looked like Petticut
Loin! She’d sell anything to anyone who
come along. Charlie King, who’s drovin’
for Sentinel station, bought the big bed.
Gave Kate three bob, a ’bacea pouch and a
sheep. Mick, the coach-driver, ’as the dining
soot up at the stables. ’E ses ’e’s goin’ to
send it to his sister. Maggie’s got er chest
er drors. Old Matuki sneaked .the blankets
and linen, and some er the blokes up at
Harrington’s mill who were through with
the bullock-dray got ’arf er load. There
can’t be much left.” reflected Gorul’f, and I
quite believed him.
I went down through the little kianga and
on to Kate’s. It was a beautiful afternoon
and the westering sun lit a scene of won-
drous beauty—of hush and river and noble,
lofty -mountain. I was feeling sorry for
Kate, and a little mean. There was no one
about, but all round the lower paddock near
the sliprails were broken boards and
assorted debris. Smoke rose slowly from
the whare. I tied up my horse and went
round.
“E-h-ha tenakoc Joe- I jolly glad see
yon, was the salutation in the
and there was Kate, her broad, face
grinning from ear to ear, her ample hand
extended in friendly welcome. There 'she
sat behind the whare in a silk nnd.pfusli
covered chair, a week or sa ago new. now
dirty beyond expression. I realised for* the
first time what the Yankee means by “as
cheap as three cents.” I felt it all : .a set hat
big, honest hand closed like a portmanteau
o'er my own.
“You bring me something from town?”
she asked, in the manner and tone of my
sister's kiddies whenever I go to the city.
Now, I know the Maori well and I’ve
done some pretty sharp things with him. but
will you believe that I blushed —me,, a case-
hardened, grasping storekeeper? Well, 1
did, and for a moment was at a loss for
speech, but the recollection of some cigars
came quickly, and hauling out my case I
gave them to her. They were too good; but.
no matter. She received them like a child,
and lighting one sat there in her weirdly
inappropriate chair, happily blowing tin*
smoke through her nostrils.
She had been getting some potatoes ready
when 1 came. They were, iiia tin at her
feet. Meat was in a boiler near the mini.
“Taihoa. you have te kai with me," and
getting up she waddled over to the pot
threw in the spuds, jammed the lid oin
stirred up the fire and came back to finish
the cigar. I sat on an upturned bucket and
smoked too. Why did I stay?' I dnnno, but
I think I wanted her to tell me to go to the
Devil for the thief I was.
You know lliese Maoris, perhaps. It was
growing dusk now, and there wo sat, we
two —the obese Kate in the dirty, silk-cov-
exed chair smoking with an aboriginal
enjoyment in which the senses were surren-
dered absolutely to the narcotic influence.
She said nothing until the hot end reached
the big, coarse, tattooed lips. Tnen a grunt
or two and she set about serving the kai.
That was an easy process, though for mo
a plate was found. After eating her fill she
lit another cigar and began to talk.
“Py golly, we have te very good time here !”
she commenced, and went over it all again,
laughing boisterously at the recollection of
the sordid experience—about the booze, the
gorging, the motor-car and all the rest of
that summer’s joyous orgy. She liatl hardly
more than a single change of clothing, still
she snored comfortably and honorably among
the ti-tree and horse covers. Of her pre-
posterous furniture only a chair or two, a
few ornaments and the ridiculous escritoire
remained, the last used as a receptacle for
tea, flour and salt.
Not a word of regret then—not a whim-
per. Kate had had her glorious days,
retained them in affectionate memory, and
for the rest —the money, the land —they had
ABSENT-MINDED.
“Where have yon been, and how did you get
that dent in your hat?”
“I've shust been to (hic) dentisht.”
g ( , Ke : puff, l!ke the smoke of the cigar! She
was happy lefore; was happy afterwards.
She had a wonderful digestion, had Kate.
My friend Smith, who sits behind a quarter
of a million, lost two hundred and fifty last
year on a mining deal. He lias been wliip-
ping the cat ever since. Smith, viewed as a
human being, is a failure. Civilisation and
environment have destroyed the -esilience of
his mind. If he lost a couple of thousand
he’d die in a week. Kate isn't a failure!
No, no! It’s by grace of inch attributes as
hers that men and women make victories out
0 f defeat.

CHVALRY
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
IT was a foolish thing to say—
‘‘The days of chivalry are dead!”—
For Bro ( wn became a knight of fame
Directly that remark was'said.
The barmaid stared at first, then grinned,
When, bowing like a cavalier,
Brown said, in his most courtly tones:
“ 1 prithee fill three mugs with beer.”
We picked him from the floor and wiped
The sawdust from his clothes and head;
And then decided it was time
The knightly Brown was home in bed.
The task was not an easy one,
For Brown as full of courtliness
As other things, strayed here and there
To speak to damsels in distress.
Of course, though some inclined to chat.
They did not understand his mood :
And some were angry at his words,
And others were distinctly rude.
One woman dropped her purse, and Brown,
Of course, to her assistance sped;
But she grabbed first, and screamed : “ You
thief! ”
As her umbrella met his head.
Three times we saved him from the Law
Which angry females from afar
Had called, until we dragged him in
A passing, nearly empty car.
Still, after he’d apologised
For falling into Jones’s lap,
He begged the guard to take his seat,
And hung benignly to a strap.
We tried to haul him down, but he
Said : “ I’m most happy as 1 am!
Dear ladies, fret not!” till we three,
A tangled heap, fell from the tram.
Through many griefs and lobster shops
We dragged him o’er a path of thorns,
For he WOULD pause from time to time
To offer total strangers prawns.
And when we left him at his
And, shunning Mrs. Brown'to meet,
Fled, glancing back again we saw
Him lay a lobster at her feet.
The door banged sharply. As we paused,
From skyward something hit the mud.
As in the middle road there fell
A crayfish with a sickly thud.

The Prodigals.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE have followed the road of the
younger son and the track of the
prettier daughter,
But the fatted calf has a proud, set smile
and hears not a word of slaughter.
The old man’s eye is flis hard as steel and
the first-born’s stern as gravel
When the rover asks for a five-pound note
at a pause in his course of travel.
The home that we knew may be much the
same, or changed for the worse or
better.
But it holds no peace for the one who
dared to break from its carping fetter.
The place of the husks that the swine did
eat had airs that were somewhat
brisker.
Though the rolling stone may not gather
moss nor run to a length of whisker.
The moss of the home-grown kind is good
and the first-born hates to share it,
Tel for rolling joy ’twere a poor exchange
if we needs must stop to wear it;
For the song of the world is loud in our
ears and for love of its clear lights
breaking
A chance acquaintance with hogs and mire
must surely be worth the taking.
We rioted well when the cash was free and
the pigs that we followed after
Were kinder souls than they might have
seemed while we seasoned the husks
with laughter.
And the homeward track? Well, we nassed
that way, as many have done before us,
To test and prove how the fatted calf and
the household cat would bore us.
The world is wider than half our dreams.
and cleaner by far, and kinder
Than those who cling to the homestead fence
are likely to know or find her;
And some who sigh for the prodigal son
should re-read the talc and rather
Extend what sympathy they can spare to
his most improbable father.
e shall follow the road of the younger son
and the track of the prettier daughter,
And put our luck through the round of
tricks that her Sunday-school lessons
taught her.
For we know fidl well if the fatted calf were
duly slain and basted
That unless the swine were invited to come
we should think the dinner washed.

BEFORE me, as I write, is a litter of
papers, pinned together in various
sheets and marked “A,” “B,” “C,”
etc. They refer to a large crown sheet,
drawn into squares and oblongs, and simi-

what will later blossom into a full-page
advertisement telling the story of “Fluflfem’s

Fluffem is quite a good soul. He is a linen-
draper, with soaring ambitions. He stands
for Progress. He is a Wanamaker, a Sel-

Emma four drinks): “I tell yer once an ’

EMMA: “Yer won't! Then come 'ome ter

And that’s where Kozzy intrudes!
* * * *
In the winter of ’9B—Lord, seventeen
years agol — l lived on Mount Kosciusko.
Kozzy, we called him. I ran Clement
Wraga^i s ’ there; my title, I re-
member, was Chief Observer. Very proud
I was of that title, too. I was in my ’teens
then, and convinced, with all the earnest-
ness of a budding moustache, that I was a
personage of much moment in the world of
High Level Meteorology. It’s all very
laughable to look back unon. but v ith me
there is no sneer in the laugh. We don’t
grow older; we change our enthusiasms,
that’s all. Just at present, I’m convinced
that I’m no end of a poet; I have a pre-
sentiment that ten years hence (d.v. ) I’ll
be either a confirmed beachcomber or a pros-
perous company-promoter—exactly which
some whim of a future moment will decide.
But through it all Kozzy remains, alike a
memory and an inspiration. Nay, he is more ;
lie is a religion. You social folk who know
him now, who hobnob it in his hospice, who
cast his Thredbo and Snowy Rivers for
AT THE FARCY BALL.
SHE: “It's always worth while dancing with you.”
H E: “ Honored , I’m sure.”
SHE: “Yon give your partner such pure delight—when you stop”
trout, who take the trip to the summit by
way of Twynam and the Blue Lake or ride
to the Perislier Gap for a morning appetiser
—well, it pains me. Mind, I write this in
no spirit of cheap superiority. Far from it;
every Australian who loves and would know
his land should go to Kosciusko. There is
an uplift in his acquaintance that will never
fail to solace in the pettiness of daily affairs.
But—well, to me, whose whole Pantheon he
fills, it seems a desecration that he should be
made the touring ground of week-end trip-
pers. We should visit him rather as a pil-
grimage, humbled in spirit and swayed with
a great ecstasy—not as garrulous crowds
drawn by State motor-cars at so much per
round trip, with holi-
day excursion re-
bates. So much by
the way.
But Kozzy—Dord,
Kozzy as I knew him
in midwinter, seven-
teen pathetic years
ago! The hut on the
summit on which we
lived (I believe its
ruins. still persist)
wasn’t a very pre-
tentious structure. It
was built of wood,
headed outside to the
eaves with granite
boulders. Our living-
room was lift, x Oft.,
with three bunks. The
other outer room was
the same size, and
had a stone fireplace
built to it. But the
mortar used to bind
the rocks of our
chimney together froze
instead of setting,
and, crumbling away,
left chinks and minia-
ture chasms between
the granite. The snow
worked through these;
hence this room was
for six months filled
with snow. On an
average, in the winter
we had thirty-six
hours of fine weather
per week, though some-
times we’d be stormbound for three weeks at
a time. On these fine occasions we’d clear
the fireplace of snow, dig out some logs, and
set a roaring fire going till the next storm
put it out. Our water supply was drawn
from the fog crystals that form on the wind-
ward side of anything exposed above the
snow level —the Stevenson louvred screen
in our case.
Oh. yes. we had plenty tucker. Delicacies,
too. Meat? Why, we had a whole beast
that was driven to the summit and pole-
axed to make k meteorologists’ menu. I
remember that beast so well ; lie was duffed
from. . . .but why should the man know? Be-
sides this we had jam in legion tins, olive oil,
curry powder, canned peaches, onions, junket
tablets, spuds, dried apricots, spices; in
fact, pretty well everything. I qualify our
commissariat because we lacked one essential
—that was, any vessel in which our meals
might be cooked. I had ordered the stores
in Sydney; but when a kid of nineteen is
thrilled with the anticipation of becoming
an amateur Nansen, could he be expected to
stoop to thoughts of saucepans? Just at the
last moment, before the big winter fall, we
repaired this oversight by buying a five-gal-
lon cauldron at the Jindabyne store. It was
the only available utensil, and how I remem-
ber humping it on my back the thirty-seven
footsore miles to the summit,! The language
addressed to that ■cauldron would make any
lied Page appear a pale, anaemic pink. But
in reached there finally, and cooked all our
winter meals.
Those meals —they deserve a word in pass-
ing. All we Observers had been ordinarily
well reared, I think. You know, we’d be£u
used to table linen and all that sort of thing
in our homes. We carried these conventions
to our mountain hut. I distinctly remember
making Prince Alberts, or improvised foot-
warmers, out of a nicely-flowered tablecloth
we discovered amongst our kit.
When a chap lives under the snow for a
six-months stretch, not knowing midday from
midnight most of the time (we always had
a masthead light burning in the hut), he
doesn’t worry overmuch about the little
amenities of life. We d dn’t, anyway, though
so naturally did we lapse into the primitive
that none of us at the time remarked any
divergence from the normal.
Our meals, I said. Well, this is how we
prepared them. On our fine-weather stretch
we’d clear the snow from our fireplace and
start a fire. Then into our cauldron would
go whatever food came handiest—meat, apri-
cots, olive oil, jam, junket tablets, rice, curry
powder, and what not. We’d top up with
fog crystals, and boil the lot for a day or so
•—anyway, till such time as rough
weather happened along and put
out our fire. Then we’d hump this
cauldron full of hashmagandy into
the centre of our living-room and
within arm’s reach of all the bunks.
Then, just as the appetite moved
us, we’d lean over and fill our
pannikins with this jollop. pump
up the Primus stove each of us had
rigged beside his bunk. and. When
it was sufficiently heated, eat or
drink the contents according to
their consistency. I don’t suppose
they serve this dish at the Hospice
nowadays, but we found it great
stuff to stick to cur ribs.
Did we ever work? Well, no—
not in the sense the word is gener-
ally understood. Our plan was one
day on and two days off, when
there were three of us on the
mountain. At other times, as
through the worst of the winter,
when we were only two, it was day
and day about. But it was a rough
job. taking half-hourly observations
from eight till noon, and then
four-hourly the rest of the day.
Our barometer was inside the
hut, so that was easy enough.
But the other readings had to
be got from the Stevenson
screen that was twenty yards
away and fully exposed to the
weather. After a chap had fought a
sixt.v-mil e-an-hour sleet-laden hurricane
(eighty miles by anemometer reading in one
easel f r twenty-four hours he wa ’’t look-
in,i, for violent exercise. We used to sleep and
eat it off. As to the scientific value of it all,
I cannot sav. being no longer .* n expert in
High Level Meteorology. I’m sceptical. We’ll
let it go at that!
And this reminds me, though the story, for
obvious reasons, must be somewhat censored.
A certain scientist who visited the moun-
tain wished to ascertain the real difference in
altitude between Kozzy and Mt. Townsend.
This last is a near-by peak ro the north of
Kosciusko, and the one thing that was
originally so named by Strzlecki, under the
impression that it was the higher of the tw T o,
as to the eye it appears. One of our chaps,
Newth (I've lost sight of him since; I
believe he went in for aeroplane-building),
was a stud.ous fellow of scientific bent—the
real thing, not a deluded enthusiast like my-
self. Well, this scientist I speak of decided
to foot it to Townsend to reckon its alti-
tude. Ordinary trig, survey figures were no
good to him ; he had his own original method.
Newth, always eager to Jearn, went with
him. I remember they came Pack, slogged
out, after nightfall, and our scientist ex-
plained that Townsend was 7315 feet, not
7310, or something like that
• —-I forget the actual figures.
We noticed Newth wasn’t
saying anything. Next day
he came to us in great dud-
geon. “This chap’s a
damned quack,” lie said.
“When we got up to Towns-
end he took out a pocket
aneroid, jolted down some
figures, and announced to
me that the surveyors were
ten feet out in their reckon-
ing. He wouldn’t explain
how he arrived at these
figures, and I was puzzled
—a man’s lucky to get
within 200 feet of correct
altitude with the best baro-
meter reading. I thought he
must have same special in-
strument of his own. But
I’ve examined it just now.
It’s a cheap German ane-
roid, that’s all. Not only
that, but the damned thing’s
not in working order.” Poor
Newth, one of his ideals was
shattered. I don’t think he
took scientists at their news-
paper valuation after that.
Writing of phenomena,
the summit of Kozzy in win-
ter showed us a lot of
them. Lunar rainbows —we
had some beauties. And
electric fogs—very ghastly
effects; you could bring
showers of sparks out of
your hair, the snow as it fell
was lighted with a weird,
uncanny glare, and as you
■waved your hands sparks
flew from the finger-tips in
thousands. Once, too. we
had a great display of—hang
me, I forget its scientific
name, but a similar effect
to that known as the
Sneetre of the Brocken in
Ilunland. With a setting
sun and a bank of cloud to
the east we saw our figures
cast on to the cloud-bank
and magnified a hundredfold.
Surrounded by a halo, too! Let us kick, and
these shadowy colossi would do a hundred-
yard kick in imitation. Young Wragge, who
was on Kozzy after my stay there (he has
died fisdffins' at the Dardanelles since), told
me they had several views of this pheno-
menon in his time—we saw it only once.
There’s an incident worth telling in which
Jensen figured. Jensen put in the winter
with us up at Kozzy. Being aged eighteen
years he had a passion to reform the world,
and thought that the stay on Kozzy would
give him the leisure to- prepare his plans.
He’s become a Doctor of Science since, and
is Commonwealth Geologist and Director of
Mines in the Territory now. Anyway, on
one day of glorious sunshine I decided to go
out for a snowslioe run. Jensen preferred
to stay in the hut and read “Jevons on Eco-
nomics” over the fire. We had a big supply
of canned tomatoes amongst our stores, but
they froze into solid lumps in the winter.
So, shoving half a dozen tins near the fire, I
asked Jensen to keep his eye on them and lift
them away when they were thawed. He pro-
mised he would, and off I went. For some
reason or other I had to go back to the hut
WHAT FOOLS THESE MORTALS BE.
after a run of a mile or so. Just when I was
nearing it I heard a loud explosion, followed
closely by another. I rushed down the
tunnel (our roof was below the snow level,
and we had to make our exits and entrances
through a boarded-up tunnel), and just as I
fell into the room another Jack Johnson


went off. What a sight the room was! Jen-
sen was sprawled on his back ou the floor,
crimsoned from head to foot with tomato
juice. The place was like a madman’s sham-
bles. Luckily, I had sense enough to size
up the situation, and kicked the remaining
tins of canned tomatoes from before the fire.
Jensen had forgotten all about them, and
they had not only thawed but boiled! Of
course, the expanding steam burst the tins
—hence the explosions. I remember Jensen
getting up, wiping the tomato shrapnel from
his face, and quite solemnly deploring that
his book was ruined.
Naturally (or, rather, unnaturally) we
hadn’t any love affairs on Kozzy in winter.
But our cat had. Some tourist brought us
up a kitten in the summer with the kindly
idea that it would give a homely touch to
our hut life. The kitten waxed and grew
cat, but the winter cold played up with it.
During storm-time it slept at the bottom of
my sleeping-bag, and only emerged when we
lit the fire. Then it would sit on the hob and
get warm by instalments. Every now and
then we’d hear an agonised meow, there’d be
a smell of singed hair, and our cat would
jump away minus a patch of fur. Soon his
fur was all minus except tufts about tlie
head and at the end of the tail. We tailored
a bit of a flannel robe for it to keep the
little creature warm, and.... one day it
disappeared. We thought that was the
end of puss, for there was at least
five miles of snow and nothing but
snow whichever way one went. But no; in
about a fortnight the cat came back. It still
had its robe on, and looked no worse for its
holiday, though this was scarcely possible. In
dye course, or rather sooner, for they were
stillborn and premature, it had a litter of
kittens beside Jensen’s pillow.
It’s surprising the small amount of animal
life there is about Kozzy—above the snow-
line, I mean. We caught a strayed mopoke
on the trig cairn once. Save an occasional
hare or so, that’s all except the bandicoot.
The bandicoot must have been a marsupial
recluse; we saw only the one. One fine day,
when there was a bit of sun showing, we
dug away the snow from our window and
let in some light. After a while we noticed a
dark object nestled against the
and there was our bandicoot, numbed with
the cold. We brought him in and poured
some heated condensed milk down his throat.
He came to after a bit, and lived with the
cat at the foot of my sleeping-bag. We kept
him so for about a week; but one night I
felt a commotion at my toes. It was our
cat making a hearty meal off Bandy. We
said hard words to that cat. I’ve never cared
for cats since.
Strange that these intimate trivialities
come to my mind first as I type this retro-
spect of our winter on Kozzy, whilst the one
thing that really mattered in the whole ex-
perience was the spiritual influence of the
place. I said at the outset that Kosciusko
should be a religion. He should. At most a
man can love but a woman, but a mountain
such as Kosciusko inspires one with awful
reverence. His huge, gedlike unconcern for
Time and Circumstance, his rapt self-com-
munings, his kinship with the stars—-he who
can appreciate these feels very chastened in
spirit and very, very humble. Our pretty
little standards of failure and success, our
nicely catalogued and labelled ideas of right
and wrong, of Art, of Life —well, they d art
seem to matter much when you’ve thrilled to
Kosciusko, I tell you. Kosciusko is more
than a religion ; he is a.. ..

BERMARD IR[?]GLERT.
A Matter of Forgery.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE three men were discussing a con-
spiracy case which was a 24 hours’
wonder at the time. They were of the.
prosperous classes. Pleydeil, a doctor, stout,
genial and approaching middle-age, lit a.
cigar, and said authoritatively: “The utter
currishness of the ordinary criminal is the
detective’s salvation. Without the fiz-gig,
the man who loses his nerve and gives 4ffie
show away, the criminal courts might almost
close up for all the work that would comq
their way.”
Mavis, who was beginning to get on at
the Bar, agreed. “In nine cases out of ten,”
he sa.d, “the wretched accused has queered
himself hopelessly before the indictment is
drawn up. The congenital malefactor must
talk, and it is the congenital policeman’s
business to see that he does.”
“Do they talk from vanity or fear?”
queried Holt, a layman.
“A dash of both,” I think, answered Pley-
dell, “but principally fear. To the type that i
lives chronically on the edge of gaol, there
is something heart-freezing about contact
with the Law as embodied iu a large, solemn’
man iu a dark-blue tunic. The offender is
demoralised by it. He collapses; gives up
the struggle ; explains—and is lost.”
He paused and reflected. “Do you know,”
he said, “if I hadn’t had the nerve to flout
the Law once I should have taken my stand
in the dock on a criminal charge?”
“In the name of Heaven, what for?”
asked Mavis.
“Conspiracy,” replied the other. "Also,
aiding and abetting the commission of for-
gery and being an accessory after the fact to
an act of forgery. It was a pretty compre-
hensive crime, as my lawyer explained it to
me.”
“But why?” cried Holt, dazedly. “What
made you do it? What was the point ?”
“It was a queer happening,” said the doc-
tor. “Would it amuse you to hear about it?”
And his friends said that it would.
* * * *
“You remember that little swine Waffles—
Tug’ Waffles?” he began.
“I was at school with the beast,” said Holt.
“The priceless blighter who left Australia
because it was ‘no place for a gentleman to
live in’? Could one forget him?” chimed in
Mavis.
“Well, it was through him. I was 15 or
16 years younger: irresponsible, and with no
work to divert me from the path of trouble.
Fletcher —Billy Fletcher, you know—Charles
Hartley and I were lunching at the Club.
Contempt, not untinctured with loathing of
Tug’ Waffles, was a sort of cult with us
then. We got a lot of fun out of it, one way
and another. The newest story about Pug,
a recital of the latest insult delivered at
him, any remark of a derisive or derogatory
nature in connection with him was always
sure of loud laughter and hearty applause.
He was the unconscious low comedian of our
little set, and we wouldn’t have lost him for
worlds.
“To get back to the lunch. Someone had
told Fletcher that Pug was to ride a bicycle
race—bicycles were ‘in’ then —with a friend
that afternoon. The course was from the
G.P.O. to the pub. at Denniston —a matter
of 20 miles. Pug had claimed 15 minutes’
start on the ground of excessive weight, a
weak heart, and other handicaps. The idea
of his opponent was to form one of a cheer-
ing crowd to see him off, and then go home
and let him finish alone. It was the sort of
thing everybody delighted to do to Waffles at
that period. We had half-decided to turn
up at the Post Office at 2 p.m., the time fixed
for the start, when an inspiration came to
me. ‘Would you like to see old “Pug” really
annoyed?’ I asked Fletcher, a note of pride
in my voice.
“ ‘Naturally,’ he replied.
“ ‘Well, take down this wire,’ I sa’d. He
I 'reduced a pencil and paper, and I dictated
a message something on these lines: —-
To the Sergeant, Police Station, Denniston.
Fat but dangerous criminal arriving in your town
this afternoon on bicycle. Will probably seek chief
hotel. May represent himself to he a well-known
man of means named Waffles. Hold till I arrive.
(Signed) Henuv Fane,.
i Superintendent.
“Everyone was pleased with this effort,
which Hartley took to a telegraph office, as
Billy and I were going upstairs to play
cards. The trifling iest, as it seemed to us at
the time, being finished, we forgot about it
more or less. Charles gave fragmentary
details to one or two friends, and then left
for Melbourne. Billy did the same, and
went to stay with his people in the Monaro.
I did likewise, and remained in .Sydney.
“It was by so doing that I learned of the
awful and degrading things which had hap-
pened to Waffles. A boorish country police-
man had done his work well. It was many
hours before one of the vainest and most
pompous young men of means in the State
succeeded in convincing the local authorities
that he was not a desperado who required to
be kent under restraint.
“Waffles was a venomous brute, as you
know, when fairly roused. lie was pronerly
stirred up this time, and I might have antici-
pated that something would happen. Yet
somehow I didn’t. The bolt fell one morning
as I was smoking in my flat after breakfast.
There entered an inimical-looking character,
with ‘plain-clothes policeman’ written all
over him.
“He gave mo no greeting—merely shut the
door carefully, and said :
“ ‘l’ve come about a very unpleasant
matter?’
“ ‘Yes?’ I said, inquiringly.
“‘A criminal matter,’ he went on, with
more than a hint of menace in his voice.
“ ‘Very interesting,’ I said, with a rather
feeble attempt at jocularity. ‘Who’s the
criminal ?’
“ ‘You,’ he said, with the brutal directness
of his kind. ‘You and two others who are at
present away from the city.’
“ ‘Come now,’ he went on blusterously, ‘it’s
no good trying any funny business with me.
It won’t work. I’ve seen too much of it.
You know what I’ve come about—that busi-
ness of Mr. Waffles. He’s laid an informa-
tion. And well lie might—arrested before
the whole town of Denniston, and falsely im-
prisoned for nine hours in the lock-up. Well
he might lay an information. The Super-
intendent’s name’s been forged, and that’s
what I’ve come about.’
“Into tlie very heart of my panic, as it
were, there came the recollection of an
absurd melodrama I had seen, in which a
little boy baffled the minions of TustUo and
saved his erring mother by repeating dog-
gedly, in face of the most furious cross-ques-
tionings, threats and even blows, the phrase:
‘I have heai’d nothing; I have seen nothing;
I know nothing.’ I looked at my visitor.
The almost bestial stupidity of his face gave
me confidence. I decided to emulate the tac-
tics of the melodrama child.
"‘I have heard nothing,’ I was beginning
tentatively, when he checked me.
“‘Look,’ he said impatiently. ‘lt isn’t the
slightest good you telling a pack of lies.
We know. Now we don’t want you—it’s
your friend Fletcher —the one that wrote the
telegram—that we’re after. The one that
wrote the telegram in your Club during lunch.
You see, I know all about it.’
“With a mute curse at our loquacity in the
matter, I went on brooding.
“He interrupted me presently in a voice
that was meant to he genial and friendly:
‘What’s the good of hesitating?’ he urged.
‘lt’s madness. Here you are up to the neck
in a serious affair—a conspiracy. But we
don’t want you. We want the man that
forged the superintendent’s name. Own up,
and nothing can happen to you. .Stand out,
and we shop the three of you as sure as
death.’
“I had been thinking hard aud detached I,v
during his appeal. To give Fletcher away
was impossible—apart from the fact that I
had inspired the accursed telegram. Free-
dom, as the price of such a betrayal, would
be worse than gaol. In any case the authori-
ties evidently knew all. Yet, if they did,'
why the visit? Why was this moon faced
ass, _ with the boiled eyes, trying to bully
admissions out of me? I wished desper-
ately that I knew something of the laws of
evidence—whether, for instance, club gossip
could be used against one in a court of law.
He watched me closely, I might even say
anxiously.
“‘I know nothing
whatever about it,’ I
said firmly.
“He almost wailed his
dissent; and then seemed
to come to a sudden deci-
sion.
“ ‘Mr. Pleydeil,’ he
said, ‘I like you. I’ve
taken a fancy to you. I
want to save you from
yourself, to give you a
chance to end your life
free from the stigma of
crime. We know who
forged that wire. We’ve
had discovery of the
original telegram.’
“It came with the
force of a blow on the
head.
“ ‘What?’ I said
weakly. ‘You were able
to get the telegram from
the Post Office?’
“ ‘Certainly,’ he re-
plied, ‘we have it now.’
“I could see he was
telling the truth this
time, even if dim recol-
lections weren’t coming
to me of previous occa-
sions on which I had
heard of long-forgotten
telegrams and cables
being ‘discovered’ and
dragged into courts of
law.
“‘Poor Billy!’ I re-
flected. ‘He, anyhow, is
done for.’
“Then I was faced
again with the problem
of why, if the Law knew
so much, its representa-
tive was working so
hard. It provided a faint
glimmer of hope. Withal,
it was in a despairing
voice that I said:
“Listen, my man. I'm
sick of this. I haven’t
the least idea what you’re
talking about; and I
would ask you now to
get outside as soon as
you conveniently can.’
“He left looking depressed. That was
the last I ever heard of the business.”
* * * *
The speaker stopped. His listeners
stirred.
“The last of it!” protested Mavis. “But
what about Fletcher? I thought you said
they got discovery and found his writing ou
the form.”
“That’s just what I didn't say,” replied
the doctor. “If Billy’s writing had been on
the form I suppose we should all have
figured before a jury and been given sen-
tences. even if they were only nominal ones.
In point of fact, Hartley, who took the wire
away from the Club, found the writing so
rotten that he gave it lo his office-boy to copy
out. When they showed the form to Waffles
he naturally wasn’t able to identify the hand-
writing. They were up against a brick
wall. As I said before, the criminal that
shuts up has a tremendous pull.”

At Piker’s Pub.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT is Sunday morning: and the moment I
enter the Camel Hunch Hotel I become
painfully conscious of a- peculiar hush
almost religious—that spreads its serenity
over all. It is accentuated when I bear in
mind the far-reaching reputation of “Piker”
Doolan’s pub.
The piano, which not unmusically has
been asking “What’s the Matter with
Father?” suddenly and significantly ceases
its vociferous inquiries, and the lid is let
down with unwonted delicacy on the stained
and well-worn keys.
From behind the bar come the sounds of
a tiptoed retreat —whither I can only guess.
And although nobody is in sight I am in-
stinctively and uncomfortably aware of
being surreptitiously stared at by at least
half a dozen pairs of keen, suspicious eyes.
I walk past the bar, the door of which has
been left half-open —probably an oversight of
“Piker’s” in the swiftness of retreat. In-
quisitively I glance within, but even the beer-
stained glasses on the counter and the
bottles on the dusty shelves seem to have
entered into the conspiracy of silence.

p deduce that the crucifix, is- for the special
propitiation of the Church y while the cleanli-
ness is a ! judicious peace-offering to the thing
whose ears' are longer than its arm.
But on the polished sideboard: I notice a
hairpin, a piece of blue' ribbon, and a tiny
bottle of attar of roses ;■ and in close prox-
imity thereto is a hftlf-smoked cigarette. And!
I wonder. Or, rather, I might have won-

Church and the Law to these Sunset shan-
ties are few and far between-. _ In the in-
terims the room is the Scarlet Girl’s boudoir
—unless the bottle of perfume prevaricates
outrageously, and the half-smoked cigarette
is a clue of small avail.
The woman who is fat and forty adroitly
attempts to “draw” me. But I am the
Sphinx incarnate; for already have I de-
duced that 1 am regarded as a fiy in the oint-
ment. In other words, I am suspected of
being a “John” in plain clothes, sent out
from Bourke or Broken Hill to ferret out a
°Not for worlds shall I disclose my iden-
tity ; for if I do, the aureole of respecta-
bility and greatness that surrounds will in-
stantaneously disappear, and in that moment
of disillusionment I will be dispossessed of
my dignity, and become a cipher in the
crowd. And in my case at least this sublime
sense of majestic isolation, of dignified aloof-
ness, is too rare, and, therefore, too precious
to be lightly flung away.
I go outside- and sit on the rough hard-
wood stool in the long, clay-bottomed veran-
dah. A man whom: 1 guess to be the publi-
can’s “hawk” saunters out through* the main
passage, affects surprise at my presence, and
bids me a cheery “Good morning;” As a
matter of fact, it was he- who saw me first,
and it is very obvious that he has been dele-
gated by “Piker” himself, and primed by the
Fat Woman, to play the role of the hospit-
able friend and, incidentally, “get the strong,
of the stranger.” . .
He remarks, off-handedly, that it. is hot.
The absence of the adjective is a tribute- to-
the greatness that has been thrust upon me-:.
I concur. My concurrence with his stafag-
ment of self-evident fact surprises and en-
courages him —so much indeed that he- in-
vites me to come-an’-’ave-a-drink. I decline
—with secret reluctance, but with no uncer-
tain emphasis.
My refusal re-accentuates his very worst
suspicions, even as my courtesy had previ-
ously stimulated those of the woman who is
fat and forty. But if he- is discouraged he-
is not repulsed. He takes a somewhat dar-
ing “perhapser,” and asks me- how things are-
up at Bourke. My replies are guarded and;
non-committal. I am not to be- “drawn.”
A voung woman, with golde® hair and
painted lips, comes to the doorway—quite
accidentally, it seems, and is surprised at
seeing me. After the first swift but very
comprehensive glance she stares hard! out
across the mulga.
But I know that from the corner ©i the-
blue eye nearest me she is covertly summing
me up and endeavoring to “place” me.
Another young woman, whom 1 guess to
be the Scarlet Girl, joins Hebe of the Golden
Hair, and pretends to be deeply interested in
something far out on the blurred honzon-
something that is whol y indiscernible, for
the simple reason that it is non-existent,
And now from the corners of a blue eye and
iV brown eye I am analytically examined,
and, in the process, my inner identity is
speculatively weighed in the visual balance,
But if 1 am really a “John it is palpably

the suspicion, my mistaken identity, and
my growing thirst become almost intoler-
But now that I have unwittingly started
it I may as well see the racket through.
Still, I can’t help wondering whether this
unpremeditated impersonation of the Law is
really worth the candle. For the Golden
Girl is an invitation to have and to hold.
The lips of the Scarlet Girl are redder than
red wine. And the words they whisper are
each and all a voluptuous caress. ,
Besides, as if to add insult to injury, the
spacious but deserted bar-room is strangely
and seductively cool.
Enter a batch of shearers from Mulga-
wirra station. It is the morning after the
night before. A score of throats, dry as the
desort sand, ache with an insistent ache for
the liquid benediction kegged and bottled in
the bar. The stridency of their demands
is in keeping with the dimensions of their
thirst.
But suddenly the clamor of the aggre-
gated thirst relaxes into silence. The
"office” has been given. The majesty that
envelops me stands between desire and
satiation.
Still another contingent of shearers and
station-hands arrives. The plot thickens.
My sense of responsibility and
superiority well-nigh over-
whelms me.
Now, quite unexpectedly,
come disillusion and salvation.
For amongst the second batch is
one Jack Chandler, “gun”
shearer and dare-devil, whom I
used to know over in the East.
He is “rep” at Dead Dog
Downs, and, having recognised
me, enthusiastically introduces
me all round.
And so the situation is saved.
Instantly the persons of the
plot achieve a magic transfor-
mation. The process of repara-
tion begins. From the Villain
of the Piece I become the Fel-
low Who Was Wronged.
“Piker” Doolan smiles a smile
that is good to see. The Adi-
pose Angel—who may or may
not be “Piker’s” lawful wife —
grasps my hand. Her apologies
are profuse and profound.
“You see,” she explained, “lars’
Sundee-week a plain-clo’s peeler
come down from Bourkc, an’
caught 16 of ’em playin’ ’azards
in th’ dinin’-room, an’ IB darncin’ in the bar.
A find like that ain’t good for business —
exceptin’ the peeler’s business. An’, of
course, we thought you was another pig with
the same snout.”
She invites me and all hands to fill ’em
up at her expense.
The Painted Virgins fill the glasses to
the brims; and the Golden Girl, as she
passes me mine, discloses two rows of pearl
behind her scarlet lips, and remarks that
she thought from the very first I was too
good-looking to be a policeman.
I accept the compliment in the spirit in
which it is given—with water added; for
she is not the first Golden Girl, by many,
that the Mistaken Identity has met in his
wanderings Outback.
And very quickly the unwonted frigidity
of the proceedings melts as snow beneath
the sun. Laughter, now loud and boister-
ous and now alluringly sweet, re-echoes
through the Sabbath air, attuned to the
clink of glasses and the rattle of hard-won
coin.
Now, an hour later, in the parlor the
Golden Girl, with the Remittance Man ten-
derly turning the music, assiduously bangs
the keys. Once again the piano is per-
tinently asking “What’s the Matter with
Father?” But nobody knows —nor cares.
The Scarlet Girl, flitting hither and thither
behind the counter, glances significantly at
Jack Chandler, who, I learn from the Scarlet
Girl herself, “cleaned-out” the big “two-up”
school of the night before, and is, in conse-
quence, a gentleman of means.
And so the game goes on, till night, mulga-
scented and suffocating, enwraps the Camel
Hunch. And all is well, and very well, at
“Piker” Doolan’s pub.

“ T WONDER what I’m going to eat.”
Critically, the very stout lady, with
a diamond cross glittering above her
low-cut bodice, surveyed the bill of fare.
“We’ve been living on eggs —we’ve come
right out of China, so we’ve acquired the
egg-habit. I’m passionately fond of fish.
So is Mr. Jackson. But you’re warned
against fish in the East 1 suppose
you’d better bring me an omelette. Two
omelettes. Mr. Jackson will try an
omelette.”
“Yes, bring me a savory omelette,” echoed
Mr. Jackson.
“You can’t be too careful,” the distin-
guished-looking lady explained, “in tropi-
cal countries. Fish is poison. So is the
water. We used to wash our teeth with

down in New Orleans. He does a tremen-
dous business, but I take no interest in
commerce. My tastes lie more in the
artistic line. I like things with a mystery
over them —something you can’t grab hold
of like a baseball bat, but have just to feel
for. I have a fancy for Christian Science.
It is a beautiful thought. I believe in mag-
netism and telepathy. I’m all nerves, just
a bundle of nerves. Mr. Jackson don’t have
nerves, do you, Babe?”
“No,” Babe admitted. “Can’t say 1 have.

months. We sailed from Genoa to Ceylon
in a German boat. We went over India and
Burma, and China and Japan. We went up
the Yellow River to Pekin, a most fascinating
city. On our return we’re going to do Egypt
—l’m never tired of the Pyramids —and back
to Europe, stopping at Rome and Paris-
(where I have gowns to he made up) and
London —I love London —and then back
home. We’ll be nearly six weeks at home,
and then we’ll start again. Mr. Jackson
goes for a week’s fishing in Mexico. I’ve-
been everywhere, and I never forget any-
thing. I sometimes wish I could. My nerve
specialist says my memory is too retentive-
I can’t help it. I must see everything and
study it up. Travel is a great education.”
“Calcutta’s a rum place,” Mr. Jackson
observed. “People drive the buffaloes by
twisting their tails. I’ve seen buffaloes with
tails broken in three places, and some with
no tails at all. They must have been twisted
clean off. Every buffalo that passed > I
wanted to bet on the condition of its tail.”
“I just love the Orient,” sighed Mrs. Jack-
son. “It is all so mystical.”
The lady rose. “Hurry up, Babe! Never
mird the custard ! Don’t miss the moon!”
And off they went, an enormously stout,
mystical lady', and her cheerful-looking,
white-headed husband to study Sydney Har-
bor by moonlight.

Next morning, at breakfast, “Babe,” avlio
looked haggard round the eyes, told the com-
pany what a lovely time he had ; and as lie
lifted the third egg on to his plate observed
that the harbor looked better at about half-
past four in the morning than at any other
time.
“A quarter to five,” corrected Mrs. Jack-
son.
“From about half-past four to a quarter
to five —that’s the best time. I’m real sorry
you missed it.”
He never forgot to return his wife’s lead-
It had become second nature. And he
always had a smile, a smile that seemed to
have no relationship to his feelings, but just
came by instinct. He couldn’t have been
happy; he only thought he was. His wife
told him he was happier now than lie had
ever been, and lie always believed his wife.
In time, they say, the eel enjoys being
skinned.
Yet, one night, finding him hiding in a
cool corner for half* an hour, he took me
into his confidence, and admitted that “sight-
seein’ ” was the hardest work in the world.
“My wife just loves it, but I guess I'd rather
work overtime in the office.”
And then he brought out a photo, of him-
self holding up the last fish he had caught in
Mexico, a whopper of 401 b., and smiled as he
looked at it.
Babe was never intended to spend his life
touring the world. He would have been in
place in an old-fashioned saloon, chewing a
cheroot and sampling a rye whisky, as lie" re-
lated fish stories to the hoys; or inarching
down the village street, in leggings, rod in
hand and a basket on liis back. I can see
him with a smile like a fresh spring morning
weeding the garden in some old homestead
in Kentucky. The president of the Angling
Club —the apple-cheeked old uncle—the
family man with his children sprawling all
over him —that, I think, would have been
the real Babe.
Mrs. Jackson discovered his hiding-place.
“We’re starting to-morrow, Mr. Jackson,
right away. We’re going round by Java and
Singapore to Colombo. Don’t forget to pack
ybur things.”
Babe smiled proudly, and said: “Isn’t Mrs.
Jackson a wonderful woman !”

The Unborn.
The German birth-rate has fallen by 25 per cent.
The decline in England is almost as heavy.
It, SEE grim War, a bestial thing,
With swinish tusks to tear;
Upon his back the vampires cling,
Thin vipers twine among his hair,
The tiger's greed is in his jowl,
His eye is red with bloody tears,
And every obscene beast and fowl
From out his leprous visage leers.
In glowing pride fell fiends arise,
And, trampled, God the Father lies.
Not God alone the Demon slays ;
The hills that sw;ell to Heaven, drip
With ooze of murdered men ; for days
The dead drift with the drifting ship,
And far as eye may see the plain
Is cumbered deep with slaughtered ones,
Contorted to the shape of pain,
Dissolving ’neath the callous suns,
And driven in his foetid breath
Still ply the harvesters of Death.
He stands beside an engine dread.
And at his touch the awful ball
Across the quaking world is sped.
I see a million creatures fall.
Beyond the soldiers on the hill,
The mother by her basinet.
The bolt its mission must fulfil,
And in the years that are not yet
Creation by the blow is shorn
Of dimpled hosts of babes unborn !

The Heroes of My Youth.
WHEN I was one-and-twenty
The stories that I read
Had heroes fine in plenty,
All beautifully bred.
The chrism of Fate —that rare oil —
Shone bright upon each brow....
I think ’twas simply hair-oil —
For I am forty now.
Brimful of feelings noble
Those youthful heroes were ;
They lightly laughed at trouble,
They made a mock of care.
Y'et they had troubles tragic
(Though life had scarce begun)
Which disappeared by magic—•
When I was twenty-one.
Their sentiments were splendid,
Their language free and strong;
Their knees they never bended
In homage to the Wrong ;
They looked with scorn each sham on,
And never deigned to bow
Before - the shrine of Mammon —
But I am forty now.
And though their hearts-were loyal,
This lowly earth, in truth,
They trial in fashion royal,
The heroes of my youth.
Some meant to scale Parnassus
One morning fine, for fur,
Oh, we were splendid asses —
When I was twenty-one.
And woman —wondrous woman—
Whom cynics old contemn,
And say her clay is common,
A goddess was lo them ;
Her robe the veil of Isis,
A fair creed I allow:
But I am past that crisis—-
For I am forty now.
They worshipped, and they wondered,
To see the goddess smile ;
They sighed, and groaned, and blundered,
All innocent of guile.
They thought small complications
Knots ne’er to be undone ;
Oh, they had little patience—
When I was twenty-one.
They mooned around at all hours
To catch of Her a sight:
They sat up in the small hours
Love-sonnets to indite;
Her frown would plunge them deep down
In Sorrow’s blackest slough :
My mirth I scarce can keep down —•
For I am forty now.
I know, alas, the reason
Why I do now despise
Those heroes young : the season
Of broken-hearted sighs
Is past: no melancholy
l feel for maids urnvon....
Ah, come again the folly
And lire of twenty-one !

The Curtain.
TWICE a day I pass a cottage
Crowded ’twixt two ugly houses.
There a sad face at the window
Brightens and compassion rouses.
Red geraniums trail the casement,
Lichen cools the roof of shingles,
O’er the porch" a crimson rambler
With white honeysuckle mingles.
Near by fret big, freighted liners ;
Day bv day she hears the rattle
Of swift winches —hears the bawling:
Hears the gossips’ tittle-tattle.
Though all night, with sobbing whispers.
Ghostly tides that .coldly glitter
Haunt her dreafns, dawn’s soft awaking
Brings the sparrows’ cheery twitter.
Faithful as the sun her heart is
To her secret, roving lover,
Undistressed by dreams and phantoms
Night’s amorphous wings uncover.
To those deathless days of gladness
Every spring-tide bears resemblance;
Ah. the radiance of her love-time !. . . .
’Tis her happiest remembrance.
In despite of dreary dreaming,
Sorrow is a tranquil sorrow,
Mantled by a sober garment;
She may wear white silk to-morrow!
Whither sailed he, when returning?
Nought know I but this; ’tis certain,
Fate, consummate artist, acts her
Tragedv behind that curtain!

SYDNEY town is braw and busy,
Sydney folks are dear to me,
But I am fain of an ancient city
That dreams beside a Northern sea.
There the small brown women wander
Past the tall jemara trees,
Peeping shyly from the shadow
Of their dainty draperies ;
And the melancholy singing
Of the coolies passing by
Mingles with the shrill insistence
Of the sati seller’s cry.
And the steam-tram, crawling, clanging,
Wakes a contrast from afar
With the little dokkars jingling
Down the wide Passer Besar.
There the long bridge spans the river,
And the prahus by the 800m —-
Painted stem to long oaifrudder —
Wait (you’d think) the Day of Doom,
So inextricably crowded !
Overhead a concert wells
From the endless stream of traffic,
Whistles, rumbles, hooters, bells—
While a brown, barefoot policeman,
Mildly whiskered, girt for war,
Leans against the rail unheeding
The adjoining “Thieves’ Bazaar.”
Hark ! The old brown river whispers,
To the crumbling Tjantian
Endless secrets of the naughty
Little ladies of Japan,
While a gamelan uptrembles
In a haunting, plaintive tune,
And the Boinbay-wallahs clamor
To the packed Kembang Jipoon,
Till the sunset and the sea-wind
And the night’s good gift of sleep,
And outstretched in stoep and doorway
Saronged watchmen slumber deep,
And a mist is on the river,
And the cold moon overhead
Changes white-walled mosque and kempong
To a City of the Dead....
Oh, the glaring, dusty sunshine !
Oh, the savor in the heat
Of the sweaty, sickly sugar
In the gedowns stealing sweet
Through the old Chineesche Vcorstraat —■
Scents of sandal-woed and musk !
Oh, the magic of the fireflies,
Golden in the purple dusk !
Oh. the mountains silhouetted
Blue against the morning sky,
Ere the clouds are folded round them— .
They will haunt me till I die !
And my heart is calling, crying
For the days, long past, alas!
’Midst the streets of Sourabaya
Dreaming by the Kali Mas !
Sydney town is braw and busy,
Dear are Sydney folk to me ;
But—l’m longing for my city
By the sleepy Northern sea!

FRITZ S. BURNELL.
The Witless Loon.
PROUD in being the super-man (as the
gods of eld were proud)
Was he, the lord of the bonded earth,
to whom the subjected bowed,
While lackeys displayed his signs of. pomp,
and favorites praised him loud.
Yet he, who aped at the leadership, was
little and base of soul,
His heart a wizened constricted thing that
grudged the most wretched dole,
Being ever ready to seize his own to the
paltriest tax and toll.
Yet had he vast, if vicarious, sti;epgth, and
power to rive and slay— .
Woe to the wight, whether wrong Or right,
that stood to his hounds at bay ;
For he could, and he did, deal summary law,
and swept whom he chose away.
So to his zenith he flared thereby, being
more than his subject clods ;.
They said, and he thought, he was more
than they, a something akin to gods !
For the best of the earth was surely his, and
he ruled it by dint of rods.
Till into the land it came, a scourge, a
gross, unnameable thing.
To choose a victim of all the realm. And,
lo! it lit on the king— -
A plague, in the dreadest of all its forms,
had fouled him under its wing!
So that, seeing the grim disease eating his
flesh apace,
The courtiers fled, and the slaves slunk off,
and none held fast by his place ;
Even the dogs, with instinct weird, howled
when they saw his face.
The women who long had played their parts
with unctuous word and smile ;
Women, and pandering bucks and blades who
had trafficked with praise and wile,
Thev vanished out of his stricken ken now
he was accurst and vile.
To his new circle of deeper dread now never
a soul came nigh ;
Shunned, he dragged from his ancient holds
where his glories had gone by,
Betaking himself to a desert-place with his
fell disease, to die.
Yet one of the mall, the Witless Loon,
chanced on him gasping prone,
Nor knew he this for a fearsome king who
had sat remote on a throne,
But only a wight in awesome plight, a ..fel-
low of blood and bone.
And the Witless Loon brought water and
rags and eased a tithe of his pain ;
He made a shelter, ready and rough, to
shield his sick from the rain;
And cheerily sang him ribald songs, with
never a thought of pain.
And whiles the king lay praying for death as
be'ng the one thing best,
He fumbled against the seal of State on the
golden chain at his breast,
And the silver keys of. the secret vaults that
guarded his treasure chest.
And he thought: “Fate claimed a toll of
my pride, and fully hath she been paid,
Since I am bereft and stricken down, and
a very outcast made;
Seeing never a soul in all the realm thought
gocd to come to my aid.
“Yet this poor loon, of his goddly heart, not
harboring rights or wrongs.
Comforts me with his kind intent, and cheers
with his foolish songs.
He shall have the chart of my secret hoard,
and all that to me belongs!’’
He made his gift to- the Witless Loon, and
he died with a last loud groan ;
And the merry fellow dug him a grave and
marked the spot with a stone,
Saying: “Cord luck to your soul, old chiel!’’
he left him to rot alone.
Now, a bird flew over a mere he passed,
and, failing a stone to fling,
He hurled with the strength of his lusty
arm the keys and seal of the king,
And laughed, as they sank, at the splash
they made, and the rippling water-ring!

WHO has seen the splendor-bars stretch-

Where the troops of little stars make
their gladness manifest,
And the mists like pale eymars,
Know that this dear Land is best!
Who has seen the noble trees standing proud
upon the hills,
Where the sunset symphonies shine above the
mountain sills:
Who lias looked on drifting sea;,
With a Faith’s triumphant thrills;
Who has seen the starry crowds very faint
and dimly glow,
Who has seen the blood-red clouds like a
bannered army go,
Learns to love their drifting shrouds,
In procession vast and slow!
Who has seen the loving Night clasp the
stalwart, pulsing Day,
Where the sunset’s curtains bright flash in
luminous array:
Who has seen the glory-sight . .
Goeth heartened on his way!
Who has heard Australia speak midst the
skyward-lifting gums,
Where the murmur of the creek like an
anthem softly comes,
And the song of crag and peak—
He has heard the battle-drums.
He has heard the singing soul of this mighty
rebel Land,
Where Man findeth Freedom’s goal and the
clasp of comrade’s hand !
Who has seen the sunset’s scroll,
He will surely understand !
Who has felt the forest breath lightly touch
upon his cheek.
Where the _ soft wind fluttereth from the
mountain’s cloudy reek
He has heard a A’oice which saith:
“/ am strength. Be ye not weak!
'[ am strength—so he ye strong, proud of
soul and free of hand;
T ictors he o'er Pain and Wrong—here shall
Truth unshackled stand!
Serve me well with Work and Song,
Serve me well —the Fatherland /”

Browns.
ON this hot day—a day like beaten brass
Some priest has filled with incense,
till it burns
(A hard gold flame from mouths of brazen
urns)
Up to the sky above the smoke-choked
grass—-
It is not to green hills my thought has fled.
Nor the deep twilight of the stalky herbs;
Nor flower-stalls that ’neath an awning
spread
Their fragrant burden over blistering kerbs;
Nor to the fountain in a fern-house shut.
Dripping on maiden-hair its cooling stream ;
Nor virent palms about a native hut,
And long blue seas where lazy turtles dream.
But a brown burden weighs my rhyme
to-day—
Crisp cinnamons in bales of merchandise :
Slim hands that on-a zither lightly play;
Unspoken songs from brown and tragic eyes;
Piled needles on a road where pine trees
grow;
Hay-cocks alternate sun and shower make
dun ;
An umber heart encased in petals’ snow;
A mud flat bubbling in a tropic sun ;
Ranunculus bronze-tinted, or, affrite,
A flutt’ring bandit in an orchard tree;
Or bistre-bodied moths, whose lumbering
flight
Casts shadows on the bright mahogany ;
A cedar box of ripe, snuff-lmed cigars;
The stems of bracken jungled o’er the earth ;
A paddock chocolate-soiled below the stars,
And brown seed bursting with a coming
birth ;
The caps of dry gum blossoms; grass-tree
spears,
Velvet and straight above their rushy greens ;
-Some tide-dark rock that through the mist
uprears,
Against whose bulk a broken masthead
leans;
A slow stream, tan with sand, that crawls
to sea;
A sepia sail reflected in the bay ;
A tawny hawk-wing, threatening the glee
Of naked babes on sands as brown as they.

The Cottage.
WITHIN the Valley of Content
I have a cottage meet for me.
Delicious hours I there have spent.
And some are yet to spend maybe.
No other cottage charms like this
Where all my best delights increase;
For here is Love. My leman is
. The deep-eyed, gentle lady, Peace.
I kiss her grave lips, and I praise
The body beautiful of her.
Our couch is odorous always
Of half-forgotten lavender.
She loves not Love as I; but she,
My lady with the breasts of snow,
When we embrace, loves Love in me,
And that is why I love her so.
When I’m athirst I drink her sighs,
And when I hunger she will bring
Rich fruits of quiet. She is wise,
And humors me in everything.
All secrets, be it understood,
Are hers, and all love’s ways she knows. . . .
I hear the music of her blood,
I kiss her mouth’s transcendent rose.
Ah ! cold and wanton, wild and chaste •
This lady is who lies with me
On that dim couch of comfort graced
With aloes and with rosemary.
My hopes have flown, my tears are spent;
Rut all is for the best, maybe....
In the dear Valley of Content
I have a cottage meet for me.

HAVE ever you lodged, at the pressing
call
Of the Muse, in Starlight Alley ?
Do you knoAv the b ok of the dim, high hall
In the house where her favorites dally?
Have ever you listened to catch the lilt
Of those deathless songs that linger
Around the walls that the gods have built
As a house for the homeless singer?
Have you left the bread on her frugal board,
That your voice should be clearer and
stronger,
And your soul into song, in her praise out-
poured .
Till hunger you knew no longer?
On the threshold grim of the world without,
When the Muse has proved unkindly,
Have ever you stood in a hell of doubt
And groped for your harp-strings blindly?
Can you call to mind when the eyes of night
Grew dim in the dawn-light’s gleaming,
While the spirit within you fell in its flight
Through the heaven of its sleepless dream-
ing?
Have you wakened then to the deathly chill
Of the Alley, starlit no longer.
But cold and cruel, stony and still,
And known that the world was the
stronger?
Stronger than all that you feel divine,
Stronger than muse, or mortal,
As you laid your head on the stones, supine,
Outside of its frowning portal?
If this you haA'e felt, and this you haAm done,
And thus you have gone, still singing,
Then past through the A T alley of Death you
have Avon,
And your Avay to the stars you are wing-

You will live your life in the Alley alone,
But your spirit will eA r er be soaring.
Away from the world and its heart of stone,
Unknown of the world and its warring.

A Foggy Night in Antwerp.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MY shadowy friend John Lawrence
called it a dream of Antwerp. After
listening to him for awhile I felt
inclined to call it a nightmare.
He has a very foggy recollection of the
station lie started from in London. He
doesn’t even remember its name, and he
lost his Guide to London on the voyage.
A LONG WAY BETWEEN PUBS.
“Ugh! I’m wet to the skin.”
“So’m I. But I wouldn't mind that so much if I wasn't so bloomin’ dry .”
Hr- embarked from Harwich “sometime in
the night." He remembers bringing tea and
sandwiches to a ladv in his carriage, but he
didn’t know-her nationality and couldn’t
understand her language. It wasn’t Aus-
trilian or English, and those are the only
i\vo he knows. He remembers drinking a
lot of coffee at Harwich, which is a sure
that he had been drinking something
else before. 'Tie lepton bis luggug on the
\yay across as a foggy precaution on going
for the first time into a foreign country.
He remembers also a "lot of mudbanks” —
it must have been in the Schelde—and he
found himself in Antwerp “sometime next
day.” “It seemed like afternoon or even-
ing,” he said ; but it always seems like after-
noon or evening to Jack when he’s foggy.
However, here he was in Antwerp in
charge of a passenger agent, and in posses-
sion of all his luggage, a berth in the Nord-
Deutscher Lloyd’s Steamer Gera for Aus-
tralia, and three mates.
I was not surprised at poor old Jack
acquiring mates so soon. If he were to be
dropped without notice out of an airship
into the Gulf of Finland he’d turn up next
day safe and sound and dry in the nearest
pub in Helsingfors, with a Finn, a Lap, a
Russian, and maybe a Scandinavian or two
for mates; and there would be a perfect
understanding between them.
The agent —a fair-faced, pleasant young
Bavarian —fixed Jack and his mates up in
cabins adjoining, and the best cabins, too,
to be had in the steerage. Then having,
on the agent’s advice, left the bulk of his
money with the purser, Jack decided to take
a run up town, and invited his new mates
to go with him. The agent gave him a
handful of luggage labels and told him to
pur them in his pockets. Jack did so with
foggy gravity (he put them in several
pockets, under advice) ana without quite
understanding what for. He always rec-
koned he’d understand in the morning; and
he generally did-. ' Then the agent said that
was all he could do for him, and I suppose
they had some lager.
The first things that struck Jack when
he got on Belgian soil were long waggons
that seemed all iron framework, with the
bottoms only an inch or two from the
ground. “Like something upside down on
wheels,” he explained, lucidly. All the
vehicles seemed to him to be built on this
lizard or alligator principle. “They might
be sledges on wheels,” he thought at the
time.
The night was not even a pup yet; it
was braad daylight, being Northern sum-
mer. So, to help pass away the time till
dark, Jack hired a hurdy-gurdy from a
tubby little BeVian woman and played
some tunes. “She spoke a little Irish.”
Jack said. The crowd showed all the half-
motherly interest that Latin and semi-Latin
peoples feel for a certain type of “mad
English children” abroad. Jack, being an
Australian, must have seemed _to them a
trifle madder than the rest.
One of Jack’s shipmates told me some of
tliis yarn. It is only fair to Jack to say
that he left England in trouble —not of his
own nor England's bringing on—and was
coming home to a lot more of it; and lie
made up his mind to blunt it in foreign
ports. Perhaos he was wise.
Jack and his mates found themselves in
a cool place in a basement where there Avere
girls and beer. The women spoke English,
and Jack had heard enough English from
women to last him for the rest o:i his life;
so he soon led the way out. They started up
the street; and somewhere along here they
became possessed of a “guide —or a guide
became possessed of them. It was now
dark, with lights (and seemingly beershops)
all round. There was more beer and more
girl: hut this time In a foreign lauguage
Jack had a foggy recollection that he “got
on orright” there.
At this stage of his narrative I began to
get a bit hazy myself—you see, we hadn’t
met for some years; but from what I can
gather from subsequent conversations, after
they left the “orright place” they lost their
guide—or he lost them—or they had a row
about his charges and lost one another. Or
perhaps they chased him into the Scheldt
and drowned him. Jack always remembers
about Antwerp better when he gets back to
the Antwerp stage of fogginess; but it takes
heavy beer, rum, lager, gin, a wine or two
and strong coffee to take him there.
After losing their guide they found their

way back to the orright place again and
had more drinks. Jack remembers someone
singing in English. It might have been
himseif. If so the fog must have been get-
ting thicker. They seem to have left in
charge of some lady guides. On the way he
missed one of his mates. There was a row
in another place ; and the fog rose suddenly,
revealing the ladies interfering on his
behalf. He was waving a bottle or water-
jug or something, and telling them in a
loud voice that he could run down his own
blanky country, but he was blanked if he
was going to let any blanky Britisher do it.
This part came from his remaining mate.
The only Britishers present were a stout
Prussian, the propr’etor; two Belgian girls;
a French girl, or she said she was ; and a
couple of Finns —they were customers.
After getting away from the stout Prus-
sian Jack’s remaining mate lost him. Per-
haps they reckoned they hadn’t been his
mates long enough to risk being killed in a
foreign country on his account.
The row —there seems to have been a row
just about here—the loss of his mate, or the
cold air, or all three together, revived him
wonderfully and cleared his head. In-
stinctively he steered for another bar. “A
sorter half wine-cellar and half temporary
bar in a new buildjng,” he says. He seemed
to easily make the girl understand he wanted
beer. From a handful of foreign coins
she selected one and gave him some change.
Then oblivion for awhile. He seemed to be
sleeping on a “bench or sofa or something”
(Jack is great on the “something”). They
were kind and forbearing and sympathetic,
as they always are towards foreign drunks
in foreign ports, from Antwerp round to
Naples. I don’t know how I know, but
sober travellers tell me so.
Next, Jack was in a “sorter upstairs
place”—“a sorter bar and dance room,” with
the bar in a corner, and a piano with a man
at it. There were some Englishmen there.
One of the girls asked him to give something
to the piano man, and he put a coin in a
saucer, “or something.” Then he suddenly
demanded the Marseillaise, and he sang his
version of it. He remembers applause. Hav-
ing thus made a hit, he sat down with one
of the girls. He doesn’t know what lingo she
was talking, but they “got on orright,” too.
Then he “muster had a sleep on a chair or
sofa, or something.” When he woke up he
found himself asleep in “another upstairs
place.” He’s sure it was another place; but
I suppose it was the same, seen through a
different fog. There were some Englishmen
there, too. Here he was vociferously pro-
Boer (he was a moderate one in his sober
moments), and tried to bellow “Ons Land.”
A little Swiss steward from the Gera who
happened to drop in that night, and who of
course didn’t know Jack till afterwards, tells
me some of this. (He’s settled in Sydney
notv.) They soothed Jack down, and put
him to sleep again, The next Jg.ck thinks he
remembers he waa in the saloon ba-r of the
Star iii George-street, Sydney, talking to a
little, round Frenchman with a pointed beard
whom he mistook for Victor Daley. And
after that “Victor Daley” was steering Jack
down toward Circular Quay, Jack very affec-
tionate and holding forth all the time in the
old, familiar Bohemian manner which must
have amused (or, maybe, touched) that little
Frenchman as he piloted Jack to the Nonl-
Deutseher Lloyd Company’s wharves on the
Scheldt
Jack became also dimly conscious ol an-
other presence by liis other side, which was
probably that mistaken Guard an Angel
who looks after Drunks all over the world.
And, last, Jack was aware of a little,
round, tubby gendarme whose sword Jack, so
he said, was using for a walking-stick—and
it might have been true, for Jack distinctly
remembers cobble-stones round there. It was
outs.de the company’s wharf, and the meta-
morphosed Victor Daley was trying to prop
Jack up against the iron gates, and kept
saying, “Vait a vile! —Vait a vile!”
“Now what shall a man remember
In the clays when he is old ?”
demanded Jack.
And the little Johnny Darm said “Vate a
vile! Vate a vile!”
“When Life is a dying ember,
And Fame is a story told,”
thundered Jack.
“Vait a vile! Va-i-t a vile,” said the little
policeman soothingly.
Then the purser and the chief steward
came along, and out of the fog it transpired
that the little man wanted “somedings for
his little drabbles.”
“God only knows what troubles he’d had
with me !” Jack says. He wanted to hand
over five marks; but the little chap said that
one was enough. Jack persisted, with foggy
persistence and generosity, so the purser set-
tled the matter by giving two marks and tali
ing Jack aboard.
Then a mystery was explained. Sometime
early in the night he had either pulled one of
those luggage tickets from his pocket or
someone searching him for identification had
found one and tied it to the button-hole in
the lapel of his coat, so that every gend-
arme in Antwerp would know where Jack's
kennel was.
In the morning he found that the wlioD
night out in Antwerp, including what the
gendarme got for his little? troubles, had cost
less than the ten marks he had taken ashore,
for he still had change in his pockets.
And if I haven’t succeeded in awakening
a kindly feeling for that little Belgian people,
apart from their military valor, then I am
mistaken in my readers, and they are mis
taken in me.

My Uncle Jobson.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THERE arc, as everybody knows, but
two species of uncles: respectable
family uncles, and wandering, disre-
putable uncles.
Respectable uncles are tlie common mis-
fortune of aIT mankind. They are already
there, attending the awakening vision of our
youth; upright, enormous, wearing whisk-
ers, speaking with authority, the creatures
of a world grown old before our birth. But
disreputable uncles are a foreign and mys-
terious lace, drifting upon the family circle
as an intrusion, dwelling there on suffer-
ance. spoken of behind their backs with in-
dignation by our aunts and mothers, and
departing, after angry sounds from father in
the front parlor, leaving behind them a smell
of tobacco in the spare bedroom, and going
no man knows whither.
My old Uncle Jobson, in his own land,
which was the North of Ireland, was doubt-
less a respectable family uncle, though his
social status was confused by the fact that
he dwelt in our house disguised as a visi-
tor. Of his respectability there can be no
denial. He thrust its adamantine quality
upon the world without remorse, and I am
disposed to believe that his claims to a re-
lationship were just, for no one in his senses
would have desired Uncle Jobson merely as
a guest.
In appearance he was the pattern of many
another old gentleman who was ending a
long life ai the close of last century; still
smacking of antiquity in his dress, and
marking in the wearing of his hair and
whiskers the bygone fashions of his youth.
He must have been over seventy when
Eate committed me to his acquaintance,
but lie stiff moved with the hasty vigor of
choleric old age. The first impression of
his face was one of anger, “like Dives that
lived in purple, burning, burning.” His coun-
tenance was inflamed as though the fires of
intolerance had scorched it red. a redness
emphasised by a fringe of stiff white whisker
that set it off like a clown's collar. His
upper lip he wore shaved. The expression
of his eye was one of fierce suspicion, the
eye of a true Ulsterman, trained to detect
the hated race of Papists. He wore his hair
brushed forward on the temples, and high
upon his crown, like the crest of an angry
fowl, a mannerism that took one back three-
quarters of a century to an age when such
traces of the Regency as rolling collars and
high neckerchiefs still lingered in the fashions
of the time.
Not that any hint of dandyism ever graced
the soul of Uncle Jobson. The texture of
his mind was as stiff and forbidding as the
texture of liis upper lip. He brushed his
hair and trimmed his whiskers in his old
age with the same uncompromising indiffer-
ence to the graces as he had brushed and
trimmed them in his youth.
For outward show he wore unflinchingly
the garments of a colder climate; an inde-
structible belltopper, a frock-coat cut in
some antique boiler-plated fashion, flannel
shirts, and knitted wrist protectors. In
this unseasonable panoply he took his daily
walk abroad, leaning upon a stick to ease
the pressure on his corns, extremeD incom-
moded by the heat, but thrusting upon you
in defiance of it the rectitude of his dis-
comfort.
In the home circle his habits were more
relaxed. lie wore there a species of bed-
gown. deeply tainted with snuff; and though
an intolerant non-smoker he permitted him-
self to appear in what was known
in those days as a smoking cap, a thing made
of velvet in the shape of a pie-dish, with a
long tassel depending from the crown.
Snuff, as he loudly insisted, was his only
concession to the weakness of the flesh.
“I snuff, sir,” he would remark, glaring
repudiation at you with a basilisk’s eye, “for
the heid’s sake. I find it clarifies the heid.”
One must refuse to credit Uncle Jobson
with any frankness in this admission. His
nose itself was there to discredit a denial of
the habit, even if every nose about him were
not forced reluctantly to confirm it.
But if his public admission of a passion
for snuff be denied the virtue of frankness,
what must be said of his public repudiation
of all forms of strong drink? In the pres-
ence of witnesses he hainmex-ed tables in
denunciation of an intemperate world. In
the character of a passionate teetotaller, it
was his diversion to lurk behind our hedge,
a position favoring a view of Sandy
McPhael’s public-house, and from there count
its stream of custom with burning ani-
mosity.
“That's two more be the front entrance,
an’ one be the side dour. Or was it the
yar-rd he took? The fellow with the pack’ll
be a stranger, doubtless. Here’s one from
the south now. Will he pass, or will he
not? He will. No. I’m wrong. He’s goin'
in be the side entrance. That’ll be the
seventh. Yon’s the postmaster goin’ in
now, him with a responsible poseetion. lie’ll
be takin’ his glass in the snuggery, no doubt.
Oh. eh. the snuggery! An’ him with a sit-
tin’ in Goad’s church.”
And the end of his vigil was usually an
announcement, shouted through the front
parlor window in tones of anger: “There’s
eighteen gone be the front, an’ seven be the
side this hour” ; adding to himself, with
gloomy exultation, “Man, the feller’s simply
coinin’ money.”
But as a chronicler unmoved by pity it is
my business to explode the nature of these
fine pretensions. To the scandal of ray
Uncle Jobsou’s memory let the truth be told.
Our uncle boozed in secret. Gin was his
tipple, purchased for him at Sandy McPhael’s
side entrance by our odd-job man. No doubt
Uncle Jobson dwelt among us in the impreg-
nable conviction that his habit was a secret;
but it must have been considerably blown
upon even at that time, when an antipodean
nephew of the age of eight was well aware of
it.
Ilis noted advocacy ot temperance, of
course, rendered an accomplice necessary to
his secret indulgence. On such occasions
as Higgins, the accomplice, had been des-
patched upon his mission, our uncle lurked
behind the hedge, peering over it with an
expression that I then supposed to be one of
anger, hut I now suppose fit have been one
of intense perturbation. The presence of a
nephew, however insignificant, was not in-
vited at such a moment, and was more often
than not rewarded with a sharp crack on the
head, and a warning to be “Off out of this,
ye meddlin’ brat!”
It was part of my uncle’s understanding
with Higgins, the emissary, that ■ their
encounter at the gate should wear an unpre-
meditated air.
“It seems you’re out walking, Higgins,”
he. would remark, and when Higgins, that
incompetent creature, had grinned a feeble
admission of complicity in this deceit, my
uncle would turn the back of his bedgown
upon him, inviting his attention to an im-
mense pocket in the skirts.
MY UNCLE JOBSON.
“What bulb’s you?” he would remark,
pointing with his stick. “Ye’ll call that a
hyacinth, I’m thinkin’. An’ the one beyond
it be a dahlia. Oh. eh, a dahlia, doubtless.
Ye’ll note the ground’s very dry here, Hig-
gins. It’ll need wettin’ down with the
hose. Oh, eh, it’ll need wettin’ when the
sun’s off it.”
These were mere conversational flourishes,
of course, designed to present an assumption
of honorable aloofness to the fact that Hig-
gins, in the most transparent manner, was
fitting a bottle of gin into the pocket of
the bedgown.
I believe that Higgins was subsidised to
the amount of sixpence a week to lend his
countenance to these depravities. Nothing
but the fear of an exposure could have per-
mitted our uncle to disburse such a sum
without compulsion. The blood of his
Scotch ancestry would never have tolerated
so spendthrift a policy.
__ A parsimonious quality was the bedrock of
Uncle Jobson’s character. Born of a Scotch
ancestry in the North of Ireland, how could
he be otherwise? In his daily walks abroad,
for instance, he picked up and carried home
anything that struck his fancy as having a
possible value, and by his own exertions
raised a considerable rubbish-heap in our
back yard, to meddle with which was to
arouse at once a fierce remonstrance.
He was as assiduous in raking over the
council rubbish tips as any small boy in the
township, bringing home old barrel-hoops,
rusty tins, bottles, jam pots, the remains of
a perambulator, and once, indeed, dragging
from the diggings with immense labor a
heavy sluice box, a piece of avariciousness
that subsequently brought confusion on him,
for the sluice box had to be refunded to an
old Chinaman, who came into our back
yard vociferating “Wlia’ for?” in my uncle’s
very beard.
His assiduity in the matter of collecting
rubbish was the inspiration of a very suc-
cessful experiment upon his credulity in
the form of a number of paper bags filled
with sand, mnd and, I regret to say, cow-
dung. placed in a basket and left for him
to find on the footpath.
His exultation at the discovery of this
treasure trove, and Iris excited shouts as he
bore it to the kitchen, well rewarded the
trifling trouble of preparing it, and I recall
with a thrill of pleasure how he insisted on
the entire household assembling at the kit-
chen table to witness the opening of the
parcels.
This successful imposition on his acquisi-
tive temper aroused in him such an abnormal
suspicion of anything in the nature of a
parcel that some days later, coming upon a
basketful of similar neat packages reposing
outside the kitchen window, he threw the
week’s groceries passionately into the yard,
to the destruction of six pounds of sugar
and a dozen eggs. ),/
The mention of eggs recalls another idio-
syncrasy possessed by my Uncle Jobson- —
one that to me. at least, confers upon him
an immortal distinction, and that was the
persistence with which he sat on eggs in
church. The repeated success with which
he managed to accomplish this apparently
wanton and sacrilegious act almost carries
it beyond the realms of the merely acci-
dental. Once in a lifetime, perhaps, a man
might sit on eggs during divine service, but
to repeat the disaster, not once but many
times, argues something in the nature of a
Satanic obsession.
Yet its apparent irrelevancy admits of a
simpler explanation, and was at bottom in-
spired by liis parsimonious habit of mind.
It was a pleasure that he took upon himself
in the guise of. useful activity to gather the
household eggs every morning after break-
fast. In this employment he used the
pocket of his bedgown, carrying them therein
to the kitchen, or. as the occasion some-
times proved, forgetting they were there.
Still, a crushed egg or two in the pocket
of a bedgown already consecrated to the
smell of gin and snuff is no great matter.
The complication occurs when the collecting
habit persists on Sunday morning, and the
Sabbatarian frock-coat usurps the functions
of the bedgown.
You might readily conceive that any old
gentleman passionately devoted to egg-col-
lecting and cliurcli-going might on such a
Sabbath morning suffer from a lapse of
memory, confused a little by the importance
of the occasion, the ringing of church bells,
and the family assembled on the moment of
departure.
It did not need our uncle’s attitude of
rigid devotion, while others rose to sing
the hymn, to warn the family that once
again he had committed the fatal error of
bringing eggs to : church. Even I, a junior
nephew, had already recorded with exulta-
tion the loud "plop” of an exploded egg.
And since no oief gentleman, however firmly
ensconced behind a Nonconformist con-
science, can arise with dignity and praise
his God with eggs dripping from his coat-
tails, our uncle was committed to his seat
for the remainder of the service.
His appearance in church, bating such
disasters as I have recorded, suggested less
the devotee than the official. He kept a.
rigorous eye upon the passage of the collec-'
tion-plate, sometimes rising in his place to
mark the quality of a donation, and I have
seen him, when occasion permitted him to
take up the offertory himself, pause at the
altar-rail and deliberately add up the amount
donated. When the text was given out he
repeated it aloud, with an air of checking
the parson’s reading by the book, and the
attention he bestowed upon the sermon was
that of a rigorous critic, prepared at any
moment to confute a heresy in doctrine,
while his manner of ejecting an “Amen”
at the pulpit had all the quality of a repri-
mand, as though he called the parson to a
point of order. The one tremendous occa-
sion of his presence in the pulpit confirms
my suspicion that in his own land he was a
prominent meddler in church affairs. He
appeared in our pulpit after I know not
what weighty-consultations with the local
parson, and, doubtless, at his own request,
in the character of a local preacher, a
species of amateur theologian permitted by
the brand of religion practised in our home.
Not having been made privy to the im-
pending spectacle, his presence in the pulpit
burst upon my astounded senses as a pro-
digy. To me it was altogether inexplicable
how one, common to observation as an
uncle, should present himself upon the vision
in the act of preaching from a pulpit. I
have some reason to believe that my elder
brothers and sisters, having arrived at vari-
ous periods of self-consciousness, were ex-
cessively annoyed at this presumptuous con-
duct in an uncle, and I recall that rebellious

mutteriugs were indulged in during the
entire service.
I am now convinced, pondering upon the
affair, that the possession of that pulpit
must have been for Uncle Jobsou one of.
life’s supreme moments. Not that the still-
ness of his countenance permitted any show
of honest exultation. I can only surmise
the unholy ecstasy of his emotions by record-
ing the fact that he preached for one hour
and a quarter, that he prayed with un-
natural fervency and at immense length, and
that, the service being finished, he pre-
tended to be overcome by religious faintness,
and had to be supported to the vestry.
I am pleased to say that this specimen of
our uncle’s powers! was sufficient for those
who brought it upon themselves, and he was
not again invited to preach.
The mysterious politics that agitate the
elders oi a family are necessarily removed
from the comprehension of its junior mem-
bers. Uncles may.come and go, but nephews,
at least, are not made privy to the tre-
mendous issues that attend their passage.
The most that they are aware of is a dis-
turbance in the upper air, or of a hint
dropped from above like a leaf before a
coming storm. But even the most inquisi-
tive nephew is not always clairvoyant to the
nature of a hint. Should a father, per-
chance, with the air of a man goaded to
it, make butchers’ bills the subject of his
discourse at the table, or, while helping an
uncle to an extra slice, bestow that hospi-
tality with a glare of hate, are nephews to
suppose such trifles mean that uncles have
outstayed their welcome?
Perhaps, following the natural fate of
uncles who are also visitors, our Uncle Job-
son departed because his time had come to
go; but I like to suppose that the episode of
the pelted clods had something to do with
driving our uncle back to the mysterious
North.
j. as a junior nephew, was present at that
dark affair, both as its audience and its
victim. My memory asserts its capacity as
a memory for irrelevant details, and even at
t hi s date I remember that it was a hot, still
afternoon, and that the sunlight came
through the church palings like fire through
a gridiron, so that if one ran swiftly past
them the eye was dazzled by the glitter,

the wad of a cartridge with a nail, in order
to get at the powder. The one thing per-
tinent to the impending outrage was my
situation at the time, immediately outside
XJncle Jobson’s bedroom window. An

f rom him, as he asserted later and with
reason, as I can well believe—-by the impact
a clod upon his corns. Ihe uproar he
made was sufficiently appalling to need no
further explanation, and caused me to admit
all apparent, complicity with the crime by-
bolting tor cover behind the church. That
ac 't_ disclosed the perpetrators of the deed,
fleeing from justice across the church pad-
dock - Immensely relieved, I ran back at
once, anxious to place my testimony of their
guilt before the authorities, and was pme-
dia.tely seized upon aud acclaimed the felon
by Uncle Jobson himself.
The jurisdiction of the home ever too
hasty for au honorable inquiry. Uncle Job-
son, limping tragically in liis stockinged
feet, bellowed for retribution for his ruined
corns, my frantic _ assertions were disre-
garded, and the slipper—that Oriental iu-
dignity—descended on my person,
Though the burning nature of this injus-
tice engrossed my chief attention at the
time I recall the intemperate manner in
which old Uncle Jobson insisted on the
family’s presence at the scene of the crime,
But .here Nemesis was waiting for him,
this headstrong accuser of the innocent.
Startled from slumber by the atrocious out-
rage on his corns, his thirst for vengeance
caused him to rush upon a justly-merited
exposure.
“The brat tried to murder me. I'm tollin'
you!” he roared. "The stones are there to
prove it.”
And throwing open his door he shouted
fiercely : “Look yon, an’ tell me if I lee.”
The family looked, and in the portentous
nature of their silence, our uncle realised
the indiscretion of inviting attention to the
proofs of guilt upon the floor. The pungent
reek of spirits too cleany attested the secret
of his guilty seclusion, while the remains of
a shattered bottle of unmistakable square-
ness proclaimed its nature to be gin.
Too late a belated sense of caution aroused
our uncle to bundle the family into the
passage and bang the door upon his exploded
secret. I will admit that he made an honor-
able effort to cover his indiscretion by thrust-
ing his head out a moment later and shout-
ing. “ ’Tis a lotion I have for the corns."
As I said before, I do not know whether
this well-deserved exposure hastened our
uncle’s departure; but. treasuring malice in
my heart, I like to think it did.

The Ghost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF I were a ghost I could find you out,
So I kept the face and the form you
praise,
And the gold hair ringing my head about
Just as in earth-bound days.
I would tap with my finger at your door —-
Scandal, of course, would not matter then —
Not tiptoe trembling as once before,
So afraid of the tongues of men ;
But, delicate, rapping from post to post,
Even the panel I could slip through ;
Who is going to gossip about a ghost
That comes at midnight to talk with you?
Ghosts know so much. Death has taught
them this.
They have drunk of an all-revealing draught.
Where we refuse you our lips to kiss,
Some other woman has turned.... and
laughed.
But suppose at a midnight clear and fine,
Iloses heavy and chill with dew,
I should draw your dreaming mouth to mine
And wander over the world with you
By the way of the station garden;
Hayricks tented against the shed ;
One cypress-pine, like a stately warden
Of moonlit waters and dreamings dead,
Hises to climb where the dark firs straggle ;
Moonlight ripples beneath a bridge ;
Sandy slopes where the grasses haggle
With pumpkin vines for the sheltered ridge ;
The shepherd’s hut with the dun bark sagging,
The crooked chimney, the broken bail
Made wind-proof with a scrap of bagging
Kept in place by a rusty nail;
Till we came to the plain that has no ending
(So it seems when the moon is high),
To where the Dalby myalls bending
Write their twilight along the sky;
Ghosts of moons all a ghost-world flooding,
Sifted down from a sieve of blue;
Wattle grey in its pallid budding.
Ghosts of perfumes trickling through.
If I were a ghost I would seek you out.
Take the trail that we loved the most.
The world and its carping tongue to flout—
For who could gossip about a ghost?
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
My Half-Sister.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Engadine Select Boarding Estab-
lishment was a pleasant place. It.
looked out on one of Sydney’s most
charming harbor scenes, with the fighting
tops of the warships silhouetted between the
trees against a sky of delicate Austral blue.
The house was elegantly furnished, and was
NO NEED TO WORRY.
THE BOSS: “Well, Jacky, I’m off to the war.”
JACKY (cheerily): “Right 0, Boss. You not come back, I mind missus for yer.”
staffed by the prettiest crowd of maids in
Sydney. The proprietress had ideas, conse-
, , wl •
quently she had tin d n *- oc 0
with dainty tables that held four only, so
dinner was always a happy collection of
little parties. There was a good deal of
love-making at Engadine.
But, to my mind, the nicest girls in Enga-
dine were the capped and aproned maids.
That is, till she came.
I found her first when I tore down late one
morning, after the rush was over, as was my
wont, to enjoy a pleasant though harmless
flirtation with Alice, my pet waitress. She
was seated at my table. Her most notable
possessions were an unruly’ wealth of golden
brown hair; long lashes, veiling sleepy eyes
with a violet tint lurking somewhere in their
depths; and a daintily-rounded figure that
made me wish I was a painter. She was
evidently leaving, for she wore her hat, and
her gloves lay on the table before her.
Unfortunately, it is my nature that I must
be kind to someone, and as I could not
brighten up Alice’s morning with my. conver-
sation I waited, as far as possible, on Miss
Lugard. She was gracious, and when she
smiled she showed perfect, well-cared-for
teeth. Also, she had the knack of making
conversation.
r I found she was a typiste in Tliorley
Thornville’s office. Her mother lived in
Queensland. She was alone in Sydney, and
was on the look-out for a companion with a
soul. Also, her front name was Mildred.
Then she drank her coffee, rose, picked up
her gloves, and with a graceful bow moved
towards the door. She lingered to look at a
picture, and passing her I ran upstairs for
my hat and stick. When I reached the head
of the staircase on my return journey she
was in the act of going out.
I paused a moment to give Alice her usual
kiss, but she covered her face, described me
as a brute, declared she never wished to
look on me again, and as for “that Miss
Lugard”—well, she would content herself by
hoping and praying that the horrid thing
would get under the first tram that came
round the corner.
xlppalled at this outbreak I let Alice go,
and as she backed into the dining-room I fol-
lowed her to address a few remonstrances.
To my disgust, I found myself detained fully
five minutes. Then Alice suddenly dried her
eyes, cast off her incipient hysterics, and
said she must go. She added calmly: “That
cat’s out of reach now !”
Pained at Alice’s duplicity I left the
house, and sprinting round the corner was
delighted to find Miss Lugard gazing atten-
tively into the window of a bootshop where
soloing and heeling were done for 3s. fid. She
looked up with a winning smile, and re-
marked that she thought I must have gone
in the opposite direction. I assured Her 1
always went that way, just for the purpose
of having a short walk after breakfast before
settling down to the desk for the day. She
considered it a wise policy. She had herself
found the efficacy of a short, quiet walk
after breakfast, Yes, she was very fond of
the Gardens; a few minutes there seemed
to rest the soul.
We started off to both rest our souls,, and,
later on, when I had left, her at the doorway
of Thornville’s office, 1 knew she had spoken
truth. So rested was my soul that I isang
aloud as I ambled down King-street, and a
policeman asked me what I was suffering
from.
Somehow, we seemed to find ourselves in
the Gardens every morning. And one drifts
easily from morning walks in the Gardens
to theatres and slippers. But I didn’t drift—
I slithered. Before I knew what was hap-
pening I was caught in the vortex, and was
-whirling through life as riotously as my last
shilling could whirl me.
One night I drove a borrowed motor-
car to the door of Thornville’s office, and
waited there till she should come out. Milieu
she came it was in the middle of a bunch
of typistes. Thornville was a palatial
swindler and employed a large staff. I
bowed and pointed to the seat beside me.
She blushed, hesitated, and then, excusing
herself to the other girls, stepped in. They
stared open-mouthed as we glided away.
“I’ll hear about this to-morrow,” she said,
gravely.
“From the other girls?”
DOUBTFUL,
THE BOBE (finishing thrilling narrative): “And just at that moment one of the black-
fellows sent a bullet whizsing past ,my brother’s ear. Another inch and he'd
have been done for. Awfully fortunate, don’tcher think—what?”
THE BOBED : “Well, you see, l don’t know your brother."
“Yes., they’ll talk, and then Miss Simpson,
the head of the typing staff, will want to
know who you are. She’s horribly particu-
lar,’'
“What business is it of hers, or even
Thornville’s ?”
“None. But she will make it her busi-
ness, and there’s no appeal.”
“Is there anything wrong about going out
in a motor-car, then?”
“Yes. Girls in our position must avoid
the appearance of evil. This is a case in
which the chaperon applies. And I antici-
pate trouble. I think they know your name
in there. Would there be any harm in my
telling Miss Simpson I’m your half-sister?
Same mother, second marriage?”
* * * *
The half-sister idea worked excellently for
a time, and gave us abundant freedom. We
bluffed the idea through at Engadine in the
face of many difficulties, not the least of
which was the reconciliation with the in-
credulous Alice, who demanded a return to
the old system of excursions. I suggested
leaving, but Mildred would not hear of it,
and although she fumed a bit she saw that
I took Alice out now and then for the sake
of appearances.
But one day Mildred contracted pneu-
monia, and came home to bed. When the
doctor arrived it was dangerous to remove
her, and I fell in for the cost of a trained
nurse at £2 10s. per week, also board and
extras for Mildred and the nurse, and all
medical fees. It was a financial jamboree.
By the time Mildred was ready to go to
Nirvana, near Jacaranda railway station, to
convalesce, I was crippled by an attack of
rheumatism. The doctor and nurse urged
the advisability of getting her away, and
the doctor said Nirvana Rest Home was an
ideal place for rheumatic subjects. So one
day we struggled out of the train at Jaca-
randa, and a tremulous old man explained
that as we were both unable to walk chairs
had been sent up for us.
“Chairs!” I exclaimed. “What does he
mean by chairs?”
The question w T as answered by two China-
men wheeling two invalid chairs on to the
platform. On these we were placed and
carried away, while the old man trembled
after the luggage with a hand-cart.
The whole population of Nirvana was
drawn up on the verandah to receive us, and
never in my life have I seen such a collec-
tion of fat-necked men. As soon as we
entered the grounds two of them, after a
glance at Mildred, hurried down and met
us. One carried whisky and glasses, the
other a syphon. They saved my life on the
moment, but Mildred, despite their obvious
adoration, refused to be rescued. Then the
stolid Chinese gardeners resumed work and
duly landed us at the verandah, where the
hostess, in a silk muslin paraphrase of a
nursing costume, formally welcomed us.
Willing hands assisted us from chairs to
verandah, and we found ourselves at rest in
the cool, shaded sitting-room with the old-
fashioned French windows making a dim,
reposeful light.
* * * *
I shall never forget the awakening on my
first morning at Nirvana, the chortling of
the magpies, the distant laugh of a kooka-
•burra. I tried to get out, but the sharp
pain of moving drove me back again.
I fell among the clothes with a groan and
three curses. It was clearly a case of bed
that day. The shaking of the railway train
had wrecked me. So I lay there, with the
French window wide open, looking out on
the garden, wondering where Mildred was.
Once I thought I heard her laugh, and a
pang of jealousy shot through me.
I had a fortnight in bed, and towards the
end of the first week Mildred, looking more
radiant than ever, came in to stay a little
while with me. But she said she could not
remain long—she had to live in the sunshine
every moment, and in the evenings she was
too tired. Not till near the end of the second
week did I really see anything of her. Truly
she always came with the matron to say
good-night, and always maintained the
character of the half-sister by gravely kiss-
ing me on the brow.
Then one morning the wretched pain left
me as suddenly as it had come, and I rose
up softly, got my clothes on, fitted my feet
into slippers, and ventured out. Along the
deep verandah, round the corner of the house
—no sign of Mildred. Then again I heard
the low, rich laugh that always set my
blood on fire. I followed it, and turning
the flank of a clump of shrubs came on my
half-sister, seated in her invalid chair, hold-
ing court in the centre of a semi-circle of
fat-necked men.
I smiled sweetly, though inwardly I just
ached to cut every great, pendulous throat
there. They welcomed me effusively, and
one gentleman produced the whisky. I found
out in a little while they were good sorts.
Then I realised that I had made a blunder
in bringing Mildred there as my half-sister.
No half-brother wants to keep his semi-
sister exclusively to himself; and they, one
and all, laid themselves out to save me the
trouble of looking after her. I could not
explain that I wanted the trouble.
One afternoon we ventured down into a
little gully to a picnic among the ferns. We
had just got settled nicely when I heard a
loud cooee, and a minute later the husband
of the matron —a very crushed individual —
hobbled into view, waving a telegram.
It was for me, and, worse luck, from the
office. Smith, the assistant-manager, had
broken his neck —he was also a fat-necked
man—against a tram car, and the head book-
keeper, trying to save him, had qualified for
a month’s residence in a hospital. So I
was requested to return at once —that fore-
noon, if possible.
I refused in a frenzy, but Mildred pointed
out that it would give me the night to get
over the effect of the train journey. And
this I knew was good advice. Before I
started for the station I got Mildred by her-
self, and put my arm round her.
“You’ll come up from Saturday till Mon-
day morning, won’t you?” she said softly,
lifting her eyes to mine very gravely.
“Yes, dear! And now, sweetheart, will
you be true?”
“You could trust me among kings, my
lover!” she said, earnestly.
Then the fat-necked men came trooping
along to take me to the station, and told me
all the way it was “a rotten shame” to be
called away like that, just as I was getting
about. They inquired carefully what train
I would come by on Saturday, and swore
they would all be there to meet me.
And that was the last I saw of Nirvana.
It was on Saturday morning that I heard
my name inquired for, and Mildred sud-
denly floated in.
I got up and embraced her. She looked
round apprehensively.
“It was sweet of you to come down just
to be able to go back with me!” I said, with
rapture in my voice.
“Listen, dear,” she burst out hurriedly.
“I’m not going back. Mr. Leyton wants me
to marry him, and lie’s frightfully wealthy.
He’s coming to ask your consent. I had
to tell him you were my guardian.”
She looked at me apprehensively.
“Why not refer him to your mother in
Queensland?”
“That’s what I wanted to speak to you
about. You see, I’ve talked it over with
mother, and she says it would ruin me to

have him coming down to a saveloy ar.d
potato-chip shop at Darling Harbor. It
would make things look so bad for you, too,
dear.”
‘‘Saveloy! Potato chip! Darling Har-
bor! Great heavens! Where and what is
your mother?” I gasped.
Mildred burst into tears.
“Oh, he’ll be here any moment,” she said
frantically, beating the air with her hands.
'Can’t you get out. somewhere, anywhere,
til! I explain, so that you'll understand
before he arrives?"
I whirled her down the back stairs into
a side lane, into a cab. and away to an
address that she gave me amid her tears.
When 1 got out of the cab and met the
mother I had an attack of rheumatism. She
was terrific. A vast, columnar woman,
grimed and grey, only half dressed. She
excused herself on account of having to
hang over the stove “all day an’ half the
blessed night!”
She sat down and looked at me critically.
“Well, me daughter’s been telling me all
about you. Seems you’ve compromised her
somehow, but are anxious to do the right
thing. Of course young folks will be young
folks, but it’s a terrible thing to compromise
a young woman. We’ve been talking over
it all, an’ it seems to me the sooner she gets
this toff the better.”
“I don’t exactly under”
“That’s all right. We won’t refer to that
any more. What’s wanted now is a bit of
an appearance till she gets married. Well,
I can let this joint as a goin’ concern for
three months, and by that time it’ll be all
fixed up. Now what part did you propose
to take the house in?”
“What house?”
“The family home, where she lives with
her invalid mother and clever, kind but
eccentric half-brother, an’ spends most of
her time teaching her two little brothers.
The family home where her young man will be
introduced to his mother-in-law. The”
She hurried into the shop to serve some
hot saveloys, and while she was doing it.
Mildred seized me by the hand and whis-
pered :
“You won’t leave me in the lurch now,
will you. after what I’ve sacrificed for you?”
“What have you sacrificed for me?” I
asked in amazement.
“My good name at the office. I can’t go
back there. They know all about you. and
when I told Miss Simpson you were my
half-brother she scoffed at me.”
Then the columnar mother came back and
resumed the interrupted thread of her dis-
course.
“I see in the Herald there’s a place out
Randvvick way; nicely furnished, pianb. cut-
lery. linen an’ silver, £4 a week. I don’t
think you’ll strike it any cheaper than that.
Well, Saturday’s me busy day. so you two
kin slip out and see this place, an’ take it
if it suits —possession at once so as you can
give your consent when Mildred's young
man comes to ask you for it.”
Clothes and environment are wonderful
in their effects. When I dashed out on
Monday night to give my
consent to Leyton I shivered
to think of what I would
have to face. Instead I was
agreeably surprised. The
two little hoys looked very
clean and gentlemanly in
(heir new suits with white
collars.- . 1 liked (hose lit tie
boys, but whether th"y were
Mildred’s brothers or only
borrowed for the occasion I
could never decide.
1 bit the another was the
greatest transformation. In
a new wrapper, with her
hi ad made resplendent with
a grey transformation, and
her hands encased in soft
white gloves on account of
the rheumatism from which
they suffered; she bore a dis-
tant resemblance to Mil-
dred. who was a picture of
queenly grace.
Leyton came out for din-
ner. It was he who had
brought out the whisky the
day we arrived at Nirvana.
I could set 1 he was favorably
impressed. There was a
home-like aspect about the
place. I could only pray he
would not look into the
books in the library, as not
one of them had either Mil-
dred’s name or my own on it.
Fortunately lie was nut
bookish.
Then suddenly T hoped he

proposed that she should re-
fuse Leyton and marry me.
A look of terror came into
her face, and she reeled.
“Are you mad?’’ she
gasped brokenly. Then she
flung her arms round me:
“Don’t say you’ll fail me
now—now when my fortune
is made. Don’t say you’ll
fail me! Don’t” -
“No, I won’t fail you!”
I said with sudden ferocity.
“I have been dreading
this!” she sobbed.
“Look, for Heaven’s sake
don’t have a scene! I’ll do
anything in the world so
long as you don’t cry or make
a beastly row. I hate exhi-
bitions.”
And thru [ pulled myself together, lit a
cigar, and followed by my little bogus half-
brothers went into the study and gave for-
mal consent to Mildred’s marriage. I also
invited Leyton to come to the house when-
ever he liked, showed him where the cigars
were, and where, if lie was lucky, he might
find whisky.
“And now you don’t want to waste time
with me." T said. “At least. T never want
t> waste time with (lie guardian when I've
just got his consent.'”
"Ila, la!" laughed Leyton; “I believe
you’d joke if you were dying. Ha, ha !”
and he slapped me on the shoulder and
hurried out.
To ease my troubled mind I took the two
little boys to a picture-show, and next day
contrived to get myself called away on
urgent business. Owing to an accident to
the motor-car I was unable to be at the
wedding, which went on without me. Mil-
dred explained tlml although the incarnation

C. A. JEFFRIES.
Lies Told in Vain.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
McWIGGS had gone into town looking
nice and clean and bright. He came
back having all the appearance of a
man who had tumbled through a Hour-mill, his
good clothes covered with desiccated white-
wash, broken cigars issuing like brown fungi
from the most unexpected parts of him, a
bottle of stout (naked as Venus) clutched
tightly in his right hand, the leg of a cray-
fish and some Motsa cake in the other. When
his wife saw him she cried as if her pretty
heart would break, made him some black
coffee and led him through the little
MeWiggses into his bedroom.
There lie crinkled together like an ex-
hausted accordion, and, putting his wild,
woolly head out of the window, stared down
into the red faces of the astonished gerani-
ums underneath.
A late jackass, grey as a bit of weather-
stained: paling, flew into a tree, and the
sureness of its action made McWiggs think
of those miniature trolley-cars that trades-
people shoot about on wires when they
want 19s. llld. change out of a sovereign.
Oh, he had had a great day. He had
met the humpbacked man from the tov-shop
in Surreyvale. And they had drunk about
fourteen shilhngsworth of whisky-squashes
between them. And the shop-keeping per-
son, who smelt like a varnished rocking-
horse, or the lid of a speckled Noah’s Ark.
bad told him of his high do scent.
“Hi am a gen’lman,” lie had said. “Hi
am fust cousin to the Harl of Fitzbilcroft.”
And McWiggs. not to be outdone, had told
the Earl of Fitzbilcroft’s relation that he,
McU tggs, was also connected with the
peerage. .. .in fact (here he seized hold of
one of the shop-chap’s ears as if it had been
fhe transmitter of a telephone) "mv uncle
is the illegitimate son of the Marquis of
Jellyonioh !”
And tlum they had had more whisky-
squashes and had cast eyes like stones at
the common motor-car builders and rich
drapery vulgarians. They went to a quieter
Hole-in-theA\ all place. They went to a rat-
eaten club.j They bought cigars, slammed
poker-machines, took tickets in sweeps,
crushed up biscuits and pigs’ trotters,
changed their drinks and walked into a
Bible shop in mistake for a pub.
And then, somehow (like the result of a
chemical action), they had separated and
McWiggs found himself on a ferry-boat in
the middle of a great crowd of Saturday-
afternoon people, all very respectable, with
cameras and copies of Omar Khayyam. And
amongst these he found a very sober old
friend who resented his drunken advances.
But McWiggs, with his leg of crayfish and
blatant unwrapped bottle of stout, was not
to ho put off. with the consequence that,
when the boat reached Milson’s Point.
McWiggs’s acquaintance missed the train
rather rlian accompany him any further.
When McWiggs woke up he was lying in
the cold, empty waiting-room of his proper
railway station. Outside he could see a dark,
lowering sky, with light rain like
scratched glass obscuring the trees. 11 is
hat lay between his wide-spread feet and
his belt beside it, while the ever-present stout
bottle, perched on the seat, looked for all
the world like some ominous crow with
folded wings.
Me Wiggs gazed about liim
and : involuntarily gave way
In a long shivering attack
Then lie took up the belt
and buckled it round his sick
stomach, put his hat on hi>
head, seized the bottle, the
Motsa cake and the claw of
crayfish, and stepped stiffly
on r<> the station.
Nobody was in sight, and.
because he had lost his rail-
way ticket, he wept to the
blind end of the platform
and risked a £5 penalty by
crossing the line where there
was no lawful passage, way.
Once through the stiff little
b : t of saltbush he plunked
safely on to the road. The
rain dropped in long headed
threads let down from the
near sky,and the footpath,
saturated to a condition of
porridge, plotted with the
whisky-squashes in making
the road as difficult for
McWiggs as it could pos-
sibly be.
Jlis back and arms, cov-
ered with whitewash from
the walls of the waiting-
room. grew streaky and
zebraic, and liis bundle of
Jew-bread had turned into
something that resembled
blotting-paper. The bottle
hanged his knees and the
chunk of deceased crayfish
gave out the odor of supreme holiness.
And all the while he kept sorting a hag
or lies for the best excuse to make to his
dear little wife.
What could he say?
* * * *
Mrs. McWiggs came in quite brightly
with two slices of bread made palatable by
mustard and butter.
“Don’t reproach me.” said McWiggs. pull-
ing his woolly head in from the window. “I
am reproaching myself too much for that.”
“But you are really so stupid.” answered
his wife. "You know you can’t drink like
other men.”
“Yes. but you see I met such an amusing
chap. He keeps a toyshop at Blazesville.
and he says lie’s first-cousin to the Earl of
Fitzbilcroft.”
“You’re: not fit to go to town by yourself!”
“We d-drank a lot of whisky And I’m
not used to. drinking whisky.”
There was a long silence after that, and
Baby McWiggs came in and said. “Father
smells like burnt cheese.” Whereupon Mrs.
McWiggs quite sadly and touchingly drew
the pretty head close into her bosom. Two
rosy legs wriggled in the air, and in another
moment Baby McWiggs had passed over to
her father.
The faded reveller looked out at the
melancholy, wet gum-trees, the rain-crushed
cosmos and sodden grass beds, his heart
stirring and turning like a weak feather, and
his hot lingers trying for relief on the baby’s
cool neck.
Mrs. McWiggs, with a Mona Lisa smile,
sat in a chair just opposite to her husband.
“You haven’t eaten your bread and mus-
tard,” she said.
He seized the biggest slice and took a
great bite that helped the lump to go out of
his throat, and at the same time brought
tears to his eyes. But, whether it was the
result of the mustard or of his own emotion,
he was unable to tell.
In any case, he must think of (he lies lie
would have to spin.

In Spadger’s Lane.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLE Mother Moon ’oo yanks ’er beamin'
dile
Acrost the sky when we’ve grown
sick o’ day,
She’s like some fat ole tart ’oo loves to smile
On all concerned, an’ smooth our faults
away;
An’, like a woman, tries to ’ide again
The sores an’ scars crool day’ as made too
plain.
To all the earth she gives the soft, glad eye;
She picks no fav’rits in this world o’ men ;
She peeps in nooks, where ’appy lovers sigh,
To make their joy completer still; an’ then
O’er Spadger’s Lane she waves a pOdgy ’and,
An’ turns the scowlin’ slums to Fairyland.
Aw, strike ! I’m gettin’ soft in my ole age!
I’m growin’ mushy wiv the passin’ years.
Me, that ’as called it weakness to ingage
In sloppy thorts that coax the pearly, tears!
But, say, me state o’ mind I can’t ixplain
When I seen Rose lars’ night in Spadger’s
Lane.
’Twas Spadger’s Lane where Ginger Mick
’ung out *
Before ’e took to follerin’ the Flag;
The Lane that echoed to ’is drunken shout
When ’e lobbed ’omeward on a gaudy jag.
Now Spadger’s Lane knows Ginger Mick no
more,
Fer ’e’s become an ’ero at the war.
A flamin’ ’ero at the war, that’s Mick.
An’ Rose — ’is Rose is waitin’ in the Lane,
Nursin’ ’er achin’ ’eart, an’ lookin’ sick
As she crawls out to work an’.’ome again,
Givin’ the bird to blokes ’oo’d be ’er “friend,”
An’ prayin’, wiv the rest, fer wars to end !
Quite right, I’m growin’ sloppy fer a cert;
But I must gil it orf me chest or bust.
So ’ere’s a word about a grievin’ skirt,
An’ love, an’ Ginger Mick, an’ maiden
trust!
The chokey sorter word that fetches tears
When blokes is full o’ sentiment, an’ beers.
Lars’ night, when I sneaks down to taste
again
The sights an’ sounds I used to know so
well,
The moon was shinin’ over Spadger’s Lane,
Sof’nin’ the sorrer -where ’er kind light
fell—
Sof’nin’ an’ soothin’, like it was ’er plan
To make ixcuses fer the sins o’ man.
Frum shadder inter shadder up the street
A prowlin’ moll sneaks by, wif eyes all ’ate,
Dodgin’ some unseen John, whose sure,
slow feet
Comes tappin’ after, cert’in as ’er fate ;
In some back crib, a shicker’s loud ’owled
verse
Stops sudden, wiv a crash, an’ then a curse.
Low down, a splotch o’ red, that is a blind
Before the winder of a Chow caboose,
Shines in the dead, black wall, an’ frum
behind,
Like all the cats o’ Chinertown broke loose,
A mad Chow fiddle wails a two-note toon. ...
An’ then I seen ’er, underneath the moon.
Rosie the Rip, they calls ’er in the Lane;
Fer she was alius willin’ wiv ’er ’ands,
An’ uses ’em to make ’er moonin’. plain
In ways that Spadger’s beauties under-
stands.
But when ole Ginger played to snare ’er ’eart.
Rosie the Rip was jist the soft, weak tart.
’lgh in ’er winder she v:°s leanin’ out,
Swappin’ remarks wiv fee ole Mother
Moon.
The things around I clean forgot about,
Forgot the fiddle an’ its crook Chow toon;
I onlv seen one woman in the light
Achin’ to learn ’er forcliin from the night.
Ole Ginger’s Rose! To see ’er sittin’ there,
The moonlight shinin’ fair into ’er face,
An’ sorter touchin’ gentle on ’er ’air,
It made me fair fergit the time an’ place.
I feels I’m peepin’ where I never ought,
An’ tries arf not to ’ear the words I caught.
One soldier's sweet’eart, that was wot I
seen—■
One out o’ thousands grievin’ through the
land.
A tart from Spadger’s or a weepin’ queen—
Wot’s there between them, when you
understand ?
She ’olds fer Mick, wiv all ’is ugly chiv,
The best a lovin’ woman ’as to give.
The best a woman ’as to give—Aw, strooth!
When war, an’ grief, an’ trouble’s on the
land,
Sometimes a bloke gits glimpses of the
trooth,
An’ sweats ’is soul to try an’ under-
stand. ...
An’ then the world, like some offislius John,
Shoves out a beefy paw, an’ moves ’im on.
So I seen Rose ; an’ so, ,on that same night,
I seen a million women grievin' there.
Die Mother Moon she showed to me a sight
She sees around the world, near every-
where.
Sneakin’ beneath the shadder of the wall
I seen, an’ learned, an’ understood it all.
#
An’, as I looks at Rosie, dreamin’ there,
’Er ’end drops on ’er arms....l seems to
wake;
I seen the moonlight streamin’ on ’er ’air;
I ’ear ’er sobbin’ like ’er ’eart ’d break.
An’, like a kid copped ipsome devilry,
“Gorstrooth !’’ I ses, “thisis no place fer me !”
On my tiptoes I sneaks the way I came
(The crook Chow fiddle ain’t done yowlin’
yet),
An’, though I tells it to' me bitter shame —
I’m gettin’ soft as ’ell! —me eyes wus wet.
An’ that stern John, as I go moochin’ by,
Serlutes me wif a cold, unfeelin’ eye.
The fat ole Mother Moon she’s got a ’eart.
An’ so I like to think, when she looks down
Wiv ’er soft gaze upon some weepin’ tart
In bonzer garcjgns or the slums o’ town,
She soothes ’em. mother-like, wiv podgy ’ands,
An’ makes ’em dream'again o’ peaceful lands.

THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE.
The Captain’s Christmas
Pig.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CAPTAIN CRUMP peered down from
the bridge into the dusk that half hid
the fore deck, and, a movement in the
shadows confirming his suspicions, opened
his mouth In a deep-chested roar that would
have done credit to a wild bull. “COME-
OU’RER-THAR-A-R-R, you skulkin’ pig-
robber, yon,” he bellowed, reaching so far
out over the rail that Ire-pearly overbalanced.
The shadow below flitted hastily out of
sight and Captain .Crump rushed across the
bridge and roared aft for the cook.
A fat Chinaman stuck liis head out of
the galley door and mildly inquired, “You
sing-out one-time, Cap’n?”
“Sing out, you pig-tailed baboon,” roared
the captain, thumping his hand on the rail;
“I think I would sing out. Didn’t I warn
THE SPARRER : “Eh, Mister, it’s a norful thing when you’ve got no ’ome to go to.”
The Reveller: “ ’Sorfuller when you’ve got a home you’ve got to go to.”
you to keep an eye on that pig o’ mine?
Didn’t I tell you there was devilment hatch-
in’, an’ that those dirty black-squad robbers
would pinch it ’fore ever Christmas Day
came? Get for’ard an’ see that the pen
hasn't been stove in or that padlock started.
I’ll skin you alive if it has. Loafin’ there
in your bunk while my Christmas dinner’s
pinched under the two eyes of me!”
The cook waddled forward and through
the passage under the bridge deck, while
Captain Crump rushed to the forward rail
again and waited for the report.
“No touchee, Cap’ll,” the cook chanted
gaily. “Him all-ce lite Clisymus dinnah.”
Captain Crump paced up and down the
bridge snorting and stamping, and then
stormed up the ladder to the flying bridge.
“D’you see that gallowsbird Geordie coal-
heaver, Mister?” he shouted at the mate
who was on watch. “Can’t you keep an eye
lifting on that pig pen? I tell you they’ll
have that pig o’ mine as sure’s Fate.”
“It’s a bit dark down there, sir,” Said Mr.
Jones. “Can hardly see clear; but you may
be sure the pig’ll sing out if anyone touches
him.”
“Sing out,” snorted the . captain. “Does
he do much else? Seven times last night I
was ouf of my bunk like a Jack-in-the-box
’cause that brute woke me up with his con-
founded squeals. Nightmare, I think.”
“He certainly squeals like a good ’un,”
admitted the mate.
“I’d kill him now,” went on the captain,
tramping up and down the bridge. “It’s
only two days to Christmas. But I doubt
if he’d keep in this weather. An’ I’ve set
my mind on havin’ him for Christmas din-
ner. Never tasted suckin’-pig in my life:
and by the look things I’m gettin’ to
doubt if I will this time.”
He wheeled suddenly in his march and
peered over the rail at the deck below.
“Did you hear anything?” he demanded sus-
piciously. The mate came and leaned over
the rail with him, and just then the pig broke
into a series of screams and shrieks.
“They’re at ’im again,” roared Captain
Crump; leaping from the rail and going
down the steps to the lower bridge with the
rush of a wild bull. “Gerr-ou’rer-that,” he
yelled. “Who’s touchin’- my pig? Where’s
my revolver? By thunder. I’ll plug the
hound that goes near that pen.” He leaped
down the other steps and rushed to the pen
where the pig was still squealing like a
demented bagpipe.
“SIIURRUP you—you PIG.” yelled the
captain, kicking the pen viciously. The jar
shocked the pig into silence for a moment,
and Captain Crump poured out the most
blood-curdling threats of what he would do
if it started again. The pig immediately
gave him an excuse for carrying them out.
for before he had time to turn away it
started as bad a noise as ever.
The captain kicked the pen again and
again, without any desired effect, and then
went aft shouting for the cook. “Give that
beast something to eat,” he commanded.
“Only time it seems to be mde* ‘ • vyhen its
mouth’s full with rnore’n its tongc
ITe went up to the flying bridge again and
watched the dark figure of the cook busying
himself.
“You better get a light rigged over that
pen, Mister,” he said suddenly. “You could
never see if any of those robbers were at
’im. P’raps a light will keep ’em off. Get
if fixed up, will you?”
“To-night, sir?” asked the mate.
“To-night?” repeated the captain, testily.
“Yes, to-night. A lamp isn’t much good in
the daytime, is it? And those body-snatchers
know this is their last chance, ’cos the pig
may be killed to-morrow. Though even
then, b’ thunder, I believe I’ll have to sleep
with the dash corpse in my cabin or under
my pillow to’ make sure it’s safe. Get your
light rigged right away.”
The mate went off .a little grumpily, while
the captain fell to Stamping up and down
the bridge again.
He was clearly in an irritable mood,
although his loud i-oa.-rs and stampings were
hardly a sign to go- by. Roaring was a
habit with him. He could not give the most
casual command without bellowing -as if he
was trying to shout through a whole gale,
and at the slightest hint of hesitation in
answering or obeying him his voice rose to
a steam-siren roar and his face went a deep
crimson-purple. He fretted and fumed im-
patiently while the mate went for the lamp,
and when the Steward came to him to say
one of the men wanted something for tooth-
ache, lie snapped at the steward as if he had
asked him for his head.
“No, sir; beg pard’n, sir. I didn’t know
what to give ’im, sir. Opiyum, sir, ’e
wanted, sir. Something to make ’im sleep,
sir. Will I give ’im some, sir?” said the
steward nervously, shuffling from one foot to
the, other.
“Give him his opium then,” exploded the
captain. “And don’t stand there doing sand-
dances and double shuffles, wearin’ a hole in
my decks.”
The steward retired so hurriedly that he
nearly fell down the ladder, and, being a
nervous man, was so A shaky that he
measured out opium enough to the patient
to have cured every tooth in the head of a
crocodile. Curiously enough the man —a
stoker in dungarees holding a red handker-
chief to his cheek and groaning dismally—
did not think even this amount was enough,
and begged for some more. “T’ put a drop
moare on if’t wakes us up in the night,” he
explained, and the steward tilted out a fur-
ther supply, warning the man to be careful
of it or he mightn’t wake in the night or the
morning.
When the fireman went forward he and
his mates had an earnest consultation. “How
much will it take?” asked one. “Dunno,
but better give ’im plenty,” said another.
“Wonder if it’ll make the blighter taste o’
the stuff,” remarked a third. “Fetch out
that bread an’ let’s fix it up.”
Captain Crump watched the lantern
swung over the pig pen on the deck below
him, and then, stepping back with a remark
of satisfaction, trod on the toe of his dog,
which emitted a yelp.
“Gerraway, then,” shouted the captain in
a. guttural roar of wrath. “Hanging round
like a dashed idiot to get tramped on. Hoy!
STEW-AR-R-R-RD!”
“Sir?” piped a tremulous voice below.
“Yessir,” and the steward skipped hastily
up the steps.
“Take this maddened fool of a dog below
there and tie him up to the pig-pen,” com-
manded the captain. “P’raps lie’ll bark if
anyone goes near my pig. And you nip out
if you hear ’im bark during Ihe night. I’m
not goin’ to have that pig stolen if I can
help it. Near 200 miles the beast was sent
down to Sydney to me, and now I’ve shipped
’im near the length o’ Australia I don’t want
any pig-snatchin’ hands to snaffle ’im. So
you keep a lookout.”
“Yessir. Very good sir. I’ll see to it,
sir,” the steward assured him, grabbing the
dog by the collar and dragging him to the
steps. “Good boy, poor old Waddle, then ;
come along, good dog,” he said soothingly;
and then on the lower bridge deck there was
the sound of a scuffle, a sharp exclamation,
a thump, and a sharper yelp.
“It’s all right, sir. Nothing, sir. lie —
ho tried to bite, sir.” answered the steward
to the captain’s roar.
“Lerrim bite, then,” called the captain.
“Good job if he bites any maraudin robbers
to-night. Tell the cook 1 want him attei
you tie the dog up.” , , . . ~
Waddle protested a good deal against., tne
indignity of being tied up, but he was a tat
and lethargic animal, little given do unneces-
sary movement or trouble, and he soon
resigned himself to the inevitable and a
hard bed on the iron deck.
He growled once when a fireman walked
along the deck to the fo’c’s’le, and the cap-
tain heard him and chuckled pleasantly.
"That’s all right,” he said to the mate.
“You’ll hear him snap if any of the hands
come near him.”
When the Chinaman cook came up the
captain took him over to the rail and pointed
to the pig pen. “I’ve swung a light over
’im,” he said fiercely. “I’ve tied my dog up
beside ’im. Now you’ll be' answerable for
that animal’s carcase to-morrow morning,
and if a hair of his head’s missing, I’ll cut
your pigtail off, b’ thunder I will.”
“Me watchee, Cap’n,” protested the cook.
“Me watchee velly, veliy caleful. Me cuttim
thloat sun-jump-up to-mollow.”
“See you do, then,” growled the captain,
“or look out for numlier one top-side squalls.
I’m mistrustin’ those d —d firemen. I’ve
known good grub cooked at a stokehold fire
before now, and if they got bands on my
pig there wouldn’t be hoof or whisker left
for me to prove it on ’em. So you’ keep your
eyes skinned.”
The cook went, with renewed protesta-
tions of his watchfulness, and the ship
settled down to the quiet of night.
Soon after midnight’s eight bells went the
lookout reported a light on the port bow,
and the officer on watch went down to the
captain’s cabin to report the North Reef
light and give its bearing. A shrieking dis-
cord of squeals and yelps interrupted him,
and the captain bounced out of his bunk and
rushed out to the bridge rail. The noise had
ceased suddenly, and the white body of the
pig could be seen in the pen. “Noisy brute !”
fumed the captain. “And look at that fat
fool of a dog snuffin’ at the deck plates as if
there was a rabbit hidden under ’em.”
Growling angrily he went back to his bunk,
while the mate climbed to the flying bridge
again.
Later on a Burns Thilp boat passed, going
south, and the two ships blinked an ex-
change of names by lamp signal. Some
quiet movements on'the deck below at this
period naturally escaped the attention of the
busy officer on the bridge.
Daylight was just beginning to show when
the cook waddled forward to the pig pen.
At first sight of a broken padlock and an
open door he opened his mouth to yell, but
thought better of it and closed it again. He
clutched at his head with a despairing ges-
ture, peered wildly into every corner of the
pen, and then rolled an apprehensive eye
towards the captain’s cabin. He caught
sight of Waddle next, and a glint of fury
passed over his face as he saw the attitude
of peaceful sleep of the watch dog. “Whaf-
for?” he hissed. “Whaffor you no lookee
out?” and his foot shot out in a vicious kick.
Waddle never stirred, and the cook glared
at him in amazement. He stooped and made
a swift examination, sniffed once or twice,
then bent and opened the dog’s mouth and
sniffed again. “Allee same smell smokee
pipe,” he murmured with a gleam of under-
standing in his eyes. He glanced hastily up
at the bridge, scooped Waddle up under his
arm and silently glided aft.
In the galley he roused a wooden-faced
assistant to activity with a torrent of
Chinese and pidgin English. “You clipee-
clipee hair-cut have-got,” he chattered.
“Plenty mucliee clipee-clipee, shavee-shavee.
Savvy no one lookee. Shutim door.”
Silently and obediently the assistant closed
the galley doors and produced his hair clip-
pers and razors —his tools of trade as ship’s
barber. And when he had clipped and
shaved the ship’s dog it was a very unrecog-
nisable animal save as concerned its ex-
tremities.
LOTE’S MESSENGER.
“Norah, darlint, whin your divil a[?] a goat
ate th’ roses I was sarin for yes, I fell
it mint somethin’, lint whin th ’ know-
in' haste stharted to ate me best pants
I knew at wanst he was some sort a[?]
a sthinkin’ Kewpid!”
There were several curious facts about
that Christmas dinner on hoard.
The captain and the officers admitted a
certain amount of disappointment over the
sucking pig, saying it was neither as deli-
cately flavored nor as tender as they had
been led to expect. The captain went so far
as to say that the flavor oddly resembled
ship’s salt pork, but accepted the cook’s
explanation of the necessity for frequent
basting with pork fat. The cook also ex-
plained the absence of head and feet by
saying that was the way roast sucking-pig
was always served in China.
The next curious fact was that no amount
of whistling could bring Waddle to enjoy
the pig’s bones set aside as his share in the
feast.

A Letter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DOES the M’rong or the right of it
touch me
On the hillside here in the sun?
With the wind and the sea in my hair and
face,
Does it matter M’hat’s done or undone?
With the lush grass whispering to me,
And the gorse smelling strong and sweet,
Because you are down and vanquished
Think you I’ll sound the retreat?
The town lying there in the hollow
Is but a leaf in a forest of trees;
Beckon and I will follow
To the rim of the farthest seas;
Together in some new country,
Love founded, we’ll build our home;
Though they deny us the broad highway,
We’ll hew our own road to Rome.
The songs to my lips will come fluttering,
And laughter will dwell in my eyes;
Though our hearts should faint at the toiling
Yet our souls, as the stars in the skies,
Shall stand unshaken and fearless;
We’ll work our redemption yet—
Make blossom the way that was cheerless;
In the right New the Mwong Old forget.
With the wind and the sea on my hair and
face,
Here on the green hillside,
Do I care what our small town da 11s dis-
grace?
Oh, the world is big and w T ide!
Together in some far country,
Truth founded, we’ll, build our home.
Though they deny us the broad highway,
We’ll heM r our omui road to Rome.

The Wedding Dress.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT M 7 as a lovely wedding dress.
All the girls in Reid’s M 7 orkroom
raved about it. They said it M 7 as a
vision and a palpitation.
The overdress of Irish lace bordered with
a deep fringe of jewelled beads spread and
glittered over the softest chiffon satin, and
an exquisite train, M 7 ith delicate trails of
satin roses and myriads of satin rose leaves
rambling over it in prodigal profusion, fell
like a mist from the shoulders.
But the wedding dress was not finished,
or anything like it. “Cripes,” the head of
the skirt girls, and “Crikey,” the head of the
bodice girls, were only building it, and it
was pinned together on the stand for effect.
At nine o’clock Miss White bore away the
overdress, Miss Dunstan the train and skirt,
and Miss Dempsey the bodice.
Cripes and Crikey gave their morning
orders.
“Miss Slater’s Mredding dress must be fin-
ished to-day. and sent home to-night,” said
Cripes. “She’s just rang up to say so! It
will be a great rush, I can see. And the
wedding is not till Saturday, but Miss
Slater is superstitious. She M 7 on't have it
sent home to-morrow because it’s Friday!”
“Call that superstition—l call it dirt!”
said Mi s Dunstan to Miss White as Cripes
left them.
“We only began it yesterday!” grumbled
Miss White.
“Shut up, White and Dunstan!” said a
FOR HOME DEFENCE.
“And when are you going to the war?”
“I really don't know —Dad has joined a
rifle club; the Mater is. running a bat-
talion something; both my sisters are
Red Crossing, so there's nobody left at
home but me.”
girl ironing a pink-brocade tunic at the
next table. “You’d be superstitious if you
could hook a man to match that wedding
dress!”
“You’d only want a sugar bag to match
that John I saw you with last night!” re-
plied Miss Dunstan.
“Miss Slater to he fitted!”
It was a message from the fitting rooms.
Cripes rushed excitedly to the wedding
dress. It was not ready for Miss Slater.
The overdress had to be draped on the stand
again.
“Someone go down and tell Miss Slater
she is before her time!” Cripes wailed.
“This is a nice beginning for the day. I got
up feeling sick this morning, too. This is
a nice start, I must say!”
The skirt and overdress were hurled on
the stand, and Cripes knelt in front of it,
pinning and arranging, and talking to herself.
“Miss Slater’s the worst woman in Syd-
ney ! She’s a brute! She lives in these
fitting rooms when she’s getting a dress
made.’?
“Miss Slater says if she is kept another
minute she M 7 ill walk right out of the place!”
An apprentice brought the message.
The M r edding dress was snatched off the
stand, and Cripes and Crikey fleM 7 away
with it.
The room changed as they disappeared.
It was the signal for the “government”
jobs, the girls’ own sewing, to be produced.
A bodice girl put Cripes’s hat on, and a skirt
girl tried on Crikey’s new boots. Miss Jones
jumped clean over the ironing board, and
kicked her hat off its nail. The skirt girls
suddenly sprang to their feet. The bodice
girls were creeping down to them with
upraised chairs! The garrison M'as bravely
defended, and the invaders beaten back with
wildly-disordered hair and a terrible loss of
hairpins.
The girls making the wedding dress
stitched on steadily. They had fifty satin
roses to make, each rose with two chiffon
petals and a cluster of three leaves.
“Miss Slater said if Cripes and Crikey
didn’t take the overdress off her quick she’d
tear it off!”
The news came from the fitting rooms.
“What did Cripes and ' Crikey say to
that?” chorused the girls.
“Nothing,” said the apprentice calmly.
“They’re altering it on her now.”
Cripes and Crikey arrived with the M7ed-
ding dress.
“Miss Slater will be in again in an hour.
The bead fringe must be on then for her to
see,” said Cripes, briefly.
The struggle with the train and the over-
dress was renewed, and Miss White and
Miss Dunstan worked in deadly earnest.
“It’s going to be a rush day !” said Cripes
to Crikey. “Six women are due for fitting,
and we’re not ready for any of them!”
“Miss Slater’s wedding dress is the big-
gest rush of the lot!” said Crikey. “This
afternoon we’ll have to put some more girls
on it.”
“I don’t knoM 7 where you’ll get them
from,” said Cripes.
The train of the wedding dress began to
look a dream. Spidery lace wandered along
the edges, and the first trail of roses started
to take root.
The overdress, too, was looking more
fairy-like every minute, and the beaded and
jewelled fringe sparkled and tinkled deli-
cately . against the fingers of the sewers.
“Seems as if a girl would marry just to
M 7 ear that dress,” said a little apprentice
wistfully. “Wouldn’t you, Miss Dunstan?”
she asked timidly.
“I’m going to marry to wear out my old
clothes,” said Miss Dunstan, bitterly. The
rush of making roses had given her a head-
ache.
“Miss Slater to be fitted!”
She M r as kept waiting while the fringe M 7 as
secured at the ends. Trouble was predicted
in consequence, and an urgent message soon
arrived :
“Miss Slater is shooting round in her
bloomers and corset, kicking the chairs and
slamming the doors.”
“It’s a lion tamer the woman wants, not
a husband,” said Crikey, and Cripes agreed
sadly as they gathered up the wedding dress.
In the interval the girls made raids, upon
their lunches. A girl danced the hornpipe
very prettily in her
bloomers and stockings, and
a wedding was rehearsed
with a comic bride and six
solemn bridesmaids.
Miss White and Miss
Dunstan looked on with
sickly smiles. The roses
with chiffon petals and
clustering leaves weighed
heavily on their spirits.
The wedding dress came
back.
“The fringe must come
off. and go on two inches
higher,” said Cripes. “Miss
Slater Mull be in again at
two o’clock. The train
must be on then.”
The unripping of the
crystal fringe began.
“Miss Slater’s giving a
champagne lunch to-day.
Did you hear her say
that?” shouted Cripes to
Crikey.
“Yes, and choosing a
diamond necklace after-
wards,” said Crikey.
The room began to groM 7
quieter. The fun was not
so fast and furious M 7 hen
Cripes and Crikey went to
the fitting rooms. Machines
flew and fingers flashed in and out of
rich fabrics. The rush was spreading.
The bead fringe was sewn on the
wedding dress again. Twenty roses
were made,- and a second trail of roses
and leaves gleamed whitely on the train.
The dinner hour struck.
The wedding dress was tossed to the end
of the table, and where it had softly rested
lunches were scattered and tea spilt.
There were the usual lunch sensations of
a dirty workroom. A lost bag of tomatoes
was found under a roll of silk, where it had
been dragged and partly eaten by rats, and
a surprised girl discovered that the rats had
bitten through an old machine drawer and
eaten a packet of tea.
Books and fancywork and cards made a
brief appearance. The girls who played for
threepenny-bits dealt the cards with set jaws,
and the girls who played for fun threw down
the cards with shrieks of laughter.
The brief respite of forty-five minutes was
soon over.
The girls sat silently at their work again.
Miss Jones, who had gone out to lunch,
returned with a sparkling five-diamond en-
gagement ring on her finger. In the morn-
ing it would have made a sensation, and
been passed from hand to hand, but now the
strain of the' rush had gripped the room, and
by common consent the wireless message was
circulated :
“Jones has a busker ring—take no notice
of it !”
Miss Dempsey finished the wedding-dress
bodice, and came to make roses and leaves.
“Miss Slater to he fitted!”
All was ready for her, and the dress looked
ethereally lovely as they carried it away.
But Cripes came back hysterical.
“Miss Slater must have a longer train!”
she said. “A new train will have to be
made. She swpre like a trooper as soon as
she saw this one. She’s always savage after
champagne. Someone get me a bottle of
soda-water, or I’ll have to lie down.”
The end of the wedding dress stretched
into eternity now, and no girls could be
spared to help. All the roses and leaves
came tumbling off the train, and after them
came the spidery lace.
The three girls sewing for Miss Slater
plugged on desperately, and Gripes and
Crikey came themselves and helped
they could.
The room stopped fermenting finally, and
settled down for good. There were several
rushes at each table. Cripes and Crikey
passed in and out unnoticed.
The pile of roses grew and grew. There
were forty made at four o’clock, as well as
great clusters of leaves. The new train was
cut out, and the lace sewn on again.
“Miss Slater to he fitted !”
They were not ready for her. Cripes and
Crikey sent a message advising Miss Slater
to kindly go away, and return in half an
hour.
Her reply came hurtlins? back.
“Miss Slater is not going away! If she
pays thirty guineas for a wedding dress she
will see it made right, if she has to stay all
night!”
She kept Cripes and Crikey a long time
when they did go down. But the train was
right this time, and the alterations were
trifling. Another trail of roses was wanted
however, and all its clusters of leaves.
At five o’clock Miss Dempsey dropped the
fifty-fifth rose, went into hysterics, and had
to vo home. Another girl took her place, and
they worked on with lightning fingers.
Half an hour later Miss White pricked her
finger, and stained the satin. Chloroform
had to be sent for to take the mark out. It
was a vexatious delay. Not a word was
spoken by the little group for fifteen minutes.
But at last Miss Slater's wedding dress
was finished.
It was a beautiful sight.
The Irish lace overdress spread like a
magnolia flower over the sheeny satin, and
the train, with its mass of roses and leaves
blooming in splendid purity, cascaded and
foamed down like an enchanted waterfall.
The wedding-dress rush was over.
But the girls sat round the table too tired
to throw their aprons off, or take any in-
terest iff putting on their hats.
It was just then Miss Slater rang up
Cripes.
“Don’t rush my dress, and perhaps spoil
it.” she said. “You can finish it to-morrow,
although it’s Friday. I don’t care so long as
you don’t send it home on a Friday.”
Cripes repeated the message without com-
ment as she passed the girls.
“Well, I call that dirt!” said Miss Dun-
stan.

The Ghost of Rawlings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RAWLINGS had been/ missing many
days, presumably through drink, and
there had been a minute searching of
the Dun Scrub, and an accurate raking of
all the holes along the River; Quick. Eventu-
ally Albert's body was found at the bottom
of an old shaft on Gander Flat. The shaft
was a deep one, and Rawlings had knocked
its timbers about a good deal in his hasty
and ill-judged descent, with results pecu-
liarly distressing to the people who came to
identify the remains.
The Coroner sat on Albert, as the law re-
quires, and the jury brought in a verdict in
accordance with the facts, which were that
it wasn’t so much the fall as the stoppage
that killed him. Now the body was lying
in the shed at Bannock's inn. ut ' u S^a o
broke loose, and began to haunt Du rate
Hill. William Yeo met the spook, whicn
smelt strongly of drink, at the cross voa. ®
this side of Fenn’s section. The night was
bright moonlight, and William came face to
face with the visitant right in the ipidciie oi
a wide, white road. W. Y’eo reckoned h
stared for a matter of seven seconds before
turning tail and bolting for BannocKo
bar. He rushed Bannock and two others
pellmell to the shed. Albert Rawlings sti
lay on the old pine door in peaceful contem-
plation of eternity. n .
The ghost next appeared, still smelling
strongly of drink, right in the bosom ot its
family.* It lifted the latch of the kitchen
door, and loafed or lurched into the lighted
room where Mrs. Albert Rawlings, Mrs.
Rawlings’s mother and the elder Rawlings
son were sitting mournfully discussing
deceased, and speculating on his probable
destination. All three screwed round and
gaped at the spook—which, as already men-
tioned, smelt strongly of drink. The elder
Rawlings son was the first to make a move.
He got through the window, taking it with
him. Mrs. Rawlings slid from her chair flat
to the floor, and had a kind of seizure. The
spook’s mother-in-law backed into.a corner,
defending herself with a paste pin.
“Go away, Bert!” said Bert’s mother-in-
law.
“What’s wrong?” said Bert’s ghost, which
persisted in smelling strongly of drink.
“You’re dead, Bert!” said Bert’s mother-
in law.
“So’s yer ole man,” said the ghost, satiri-
cally.
“Oh, go ’way, go ’way, Bert, yer dead !”
moaned Mrs. Bert out of her seizure.
The spook seemed to consider the situa-
tion. ' “Dead, am I?” said he, and turning lie
walked from the house. Mrs. Bert said he
walked straight through the closed door;
Mrs. Bert’s mother declared might she npver
speak again if he didn’t just evaporate.
An hour later, as Bannock was on the
point of retiring, a muffled stranger called
with a polite request to be permitted to see
the mortal fragments of the late Albert
Rawlings, which, by the way, were to be
buried early next day. When admitted to
the shed he gazed with mournful interest on
the one who had gone before. Bannock
NO MIRACLE.
“But how on earth did you come to he born
in Tasmania?”
“Oh, mother happened to he there.”
noticed that his visitor smelt considerably
of drink. But he was capable of speech. He
said:
“That’s Bert all right.”
“Did you know deceased well, mate?’'
asked Bannock.
“Poor ole Bert!” was the muided stran-
ger’s only reply as he turned and passed
away in the direction of elsewhere.
The ghost of Albert Rawlings next ap-
peared as one Henry Gell, in a Westralian
mining centre, earning an honest living as
a gasfitter and mender of domestic tins. He
never drinks now, but teaches in Sunday
school. When he has nothing else to think
about he sits and enjoys his freedom as an
unencumbered citizen without a mother-in-
law and unhampered with a past, wonder-
ing, too, who the person is who reposes under
Albert Rawlings’s headstone in the boneyard
at Hurdle Hill.

Three 25ft. “Alston” Windmills, on 00ft. Towers, fitted with
10-i'nch Pumps, pumping water for Town Water Supply, at
DONALD, VICTORIA.
THE mechanism is of the simplest, consisting of only Three Moving
Parts, which are entirely enclosed in a Dust-proof Case and run
in an Oil Bath.~ Steel Ball Bearings are fitted to every working
part, making it Frictionless, Noiseless and Unwearable. It pumps more
water and runs in lighter winds than any other mill made. It has no
cogs to wear; no pins or keys to work loose; no chain drive to stretch
and get out of order. It is, in fact, the Simplest, Strongest and Lightest-
running Mill manufactured.

(reassuringly, referring to the case of “Johnnie Walker”) : “It will be all right behind, Sir."
Traveller (nervously): “Maybe, but I’ve left a case of ‘Johnnie Walker’ behind, before.!”
Porter : “ But it’s much safer in these non-refillablk bottles.”
One cannot blame a traveller for being nervous lest his case of “Johnnie Walker” Red
Label be left behind, but it is reassuring to know that “Johnnie Walker” is to be had
everywhere. The sun never sets on “Johnnie Walker,” nor on the particular man who
asks for it.
Every drop of “J ohnnie Walker” Red Label in a non-refillable bottle is over io years old.
guaranteed same quality throughout the world.
