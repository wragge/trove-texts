Dr. Me PERKY,
M.K.0.5., L.S.A , &c.,
SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical 80-. r lof jy.S. W. Late House Sur-
geon t) the Great Northern Hospital, London.
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the t' eatm-nt of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced, men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov.
6th 7th and Bth, 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that regally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from these diseases, who are scattered over nil parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider, therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which now exists , but T also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My Qualifications I Invite the fullest investigation Into. For some considerable time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observing the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults me lie is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if 1 undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete ami Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of these diseases enables mo to give this guarantee without fear.

Suffering from Impaired Vitality should send for my Work on Diseases of the Keprodiietlve Organs, which, in addition to explaining

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to t he study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment, iiis practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, Headaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowels, specks before the eyes,
bashfulness, discontentedness, weakness or pains

buzzing noises in the ears and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for ids famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they arc destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between Iho doctor' and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

THE WAY TO WEALTH.
The way to wealth is as plain as the way to market.
The majority of the wealthy men of Sydney, Melbourne
and Brisbane made their money by buying land in these
capital cities while it was low in price, and before these
cities were so large and populous as at present.
"W" eatern Australia
is the coming colony. Her Capital City will become
a second Melbourne or Sydney.
If you want to make money, buy land
there now. It Is a good spec.

The extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar

offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of iiU,

SWORN CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I#
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coining, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty’s
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 10, 1891.
State Servants’ Citizenship.
The question at issue between the New
South Wales Railway Commissioners and
Mr. H. C. Hoyle, President of the New
South Wales Railway and Tramway Associa-
tion, and until the other day an employe in
the service of the department, is much
obscured by the correspondence and reported
interviews which have appeared concerning
it. The principle which gives the dispute a
national importance is buffeted about and
sometimes completely hidden by odds and
ends of asseverations as to what words the
Commissioners used to Mr. Hoyle and Mr.
Hoyle to the Commissioners. Incidentally
we may say that we accept the apparently
contradictory statements of Mr. Hoyle and
the Commissioners as being both veracious,
inasmuch as veracity, not being always
identical with truth, denotes merely a rela-
tion of agreement between what a person
says he said and what he thinks he said.
Beyond this, we dismiss from view the entire
wrangle about the accuracy of phrases as
being of interest only in the limited sphere
of the personal characters of the contestants,
and we turn to the question of fact which is
really one of the widest and highest impor
tance.
* * *
Hitherto the employes in the New South
Wales Railway Department have asserted a
right to take the ordinary citizen’s partin the
discussion of public affairs ; and although this
part has been frequently prominent and ag-
gressive neither Government nor Parliament
has thought it necessary to interfere. The
employes in the other State departments
have so far put forward no organised claim
to such a right, and it is customary, there-
fore, to consider that they continue in their
positions on the voluntary sacrifice of certain
democratic rights. Here again the practice
of Parliament and of the Government is one
of non-intervention. It thus appears that
of the several arms of the New South Wales
Public Service, the Railway one, while willing
to work for its bread in the Service, has
refused and refuses to forego the right to
express publicly opinions on public affairs,
while the others, for the sake of the employ-
ment which they obtain, are content either
not to think at all on public questions or to
keep their mouths closed in the presence of
the public when such questions are dis-
cussed & This departure of the railway and-
tramway men from Civil Service traditions
is demonstrably a democratic gain, and the
tacit assent which Parliament gave to the
new practice proves that if other branches of
the Service move for equal rights they are
likely to obtain them. The State workman
who dares not publicly discuss any public
question would be quite Justified in declining
to vote on that particular question. Indeed,
(ho logical corollary of a prohibition to
discuss is a prohibition to vote, and this
is so acutely felt by many officials that they
profess themselves prepared to accept
absolute disfranchisement as an honorable
escape from their present position.
* * #
Discipline must, it is contended, be pre-
served in the State departments. Nobody
seeks to deny this. But to possess and
declare one’s opinions is not necessarily
insurrectionary. Further, discipline is much
more safe, in so far as it is a true instru-
ment for good and not a mere martinet’s
fad in the hands of the thinker and
reasoner than in those of the man who has
succeeded in putting his faculties asleep. Cases
of the abuse of rights will arise, but where
they arise they are to be treated as abuses
of rights and not as things in their origin
wrong. If a railway-man criminally mis-
represent or calumniate the heads of his
department or of any department he should
be liable to punishment for the proved ex-
cesses, but not for the fact that he addressed
the public from a balcony. He has a right
to do the latter; those whom he maligns
have a right to keep him from doing the
former. This does not appear to be clear to
the Commissioners. They do not, indeed,
formally prohibit their employes from dis-
cussing public affairs, but they maintain that
in the discussion of railway matters em-
ployes may not express opinions at variance
with those of the heads of the department.
# # #
A little reflection will show that this is
tantamount to a suppression of the right of
public speaking altogether. If it be a
punishable disloyalty to the Commissioners
to say that there are better ways of managing
affairs than the present, then there is no use
in public meetings or public discussions on
that subject at all. The subject is effectually
closed. This view of the Commissioners’
attitude is intensified by their admitted
allegation that Mr. Hoyle sat at a public
meeting and listened to their actions being
condemned. But the essence of a public
meeting is that freedom of opinion be
allowed. Had Mr. Hoyle gratified the
Commissioners he would have negatived the
discussion of thesubject absolutely. The Com-
missioners thus leave it to be inferred that in
their eyes the only legal public meeting
which their employes can attend is one in
which the Commissioners’ public conduct
will be approved. But it was not worth the
while of the railway and tramway men to
emancipate themselves from the sterilizing
traditions of the general State employe to
attain a share of citizenship so transparently
a sham.
# # *
The national question is: Shall the de-
parture made by therailwayand tramway men
be maintained, and pursued to even a larger
freedom, or are the men to be throttled and
turned back into the narrow grooves of
the past ? Are they to be taken as
showing the way to a platform of higher
citizenship, or are they to be whipped
back and yarded in with the other Civil
servants who, for the sake of a living, allow
the seal of silence to be stamped upon
their lips ? Is a gag to be fashioned out of
their daily loaf of official bread? Which-
ever conclusion is arrived at, it is Parliament,
and not the Railway Commissioners, who
must have the last word. Mr. Hoyle has
sat on platforms during several years, and,
with the knowledge of his department and
of Governments, has given his opinions
freely on public affairs.' Two of the mem-
bers of the Legislative Assembly sit there
now largely by his electioneering efforts.
And Mr. Hoyle is only one of those in his
class who thus spoke and acted in the open.
The absence of official interference over this
period constitutes, we maintain, a prescrip-
tive right, which Parliament alone can
abrogate, to continue in the path taken;
and officers like the Railway Commissioners
should be vested with power to punish only
for specifically-proved excesses of speech on
the part of their employes, while only the
tribunals appointed to deal with such matters
shall have power to decide as to what con-
stitutes an illegal utterance on the part of
a State servant.
The Collapse of a Cause Celebre.
The last and most important of the Premier Per*
manent Building Society prosecutions—the one
from which the shareholders in that shattered
institution expected to get a little moral satis-
faction for their money—has terminated in a
scandal worthy of such a bad-smelling business.
After two days of earnest consideration,
assisted by Christmas goose and bottled beer,
an abnormally unintelligent - looking jury
repudiated the summing-up of Chief Justice
Higinbotham by announcing that they found
none of the defendants guilty and six of them
innocent. After which these twelve apostles of
justice rushed headlong from the box to draw
fees amounting to £6O odd a-piece for having
made themselves objects of derision to every
nineteen out of twenty sensible men in Mel-
bourne. That there might be no public doubt
concerning their mental calibre some among
the twelve promptly divulged the secrets of
the jury-room, and explained that at the outset
only three of their number were in favour
of releasing the whole boiling of de-
fendants from any criminal responsibility
in the ruin they had wrought. Little by little,
as the Christmas dinner-hour drew nearer and
thoughts of peace and goodwill began to steal
gently into their addled brains, other jurymen
went over to the original trio. In a word, the
tail began to wag the dog. By order of the
Court an official picnic was tendered to the still-
conflicting deliberators on Christmas Day, and
under l lie benign influence of bottled bier
eleven jurymen decided to letoffwholedamlot.
Only the foreman held out for the conviction of
at least two defendants. Some of his colleagues
did their best to alter the foreman’s resolution by
praying that his “ soul might burn within him,”
and advancing towards him in threatening atti-
tudes with beer-bottles, possibly, in their
large, honest, right hands. But this obdurate
person held tightly to his opinion. He even
refused to remember that his conduct might
“put the country to the expense of another
trial,” and so there was nothing left for the
jury but to return to Court and wrangle in the
box until the fact that they convicted nobody
had been clumsily explained.
* * *
Therewith ended, as the Age had delicately
insinuated in its Christmas Day issue, all pros-
pect of any alleged conspirators being brought
to account. The Chief Justice, trained to re-
ceive jury-verdicts without a wince, proceeded
to sentence Doherty and Mikams, both ex-
secretaries of the Association, to fairly substan-
tial terms of imprisonment for offences venial as
compared with that which was “ not proven ”
against Doherty and Gourlay on the more
sensational charge. He echoed the sentiments
of Melbourne in his kindly remarks to Messrs.
Aim mo and Stewart, and kept a discreet
silence about the rest of the batch, of whom
two at least seemed bound to be acquitted on
the summing-up. The case having petered out
thus miserably, it only remained for the Vic-
torian Government to announce that no further
proceedings would be instituted against
Doherty (already sentenced, subject to appeal,
for his misdemeanour) and Gourlay, the gentle-
man described by Purves as “the Age’s blood
relation.” Nobody who had studied the
attitude of the whole Legislature towards
the P.B.A. cases, and who remembered that
former Ministers of the Crown had been im-
plicated in these serious. charges, imagined that
the present guardians of public interests would
fail to jump at the first opportunity to let
public interests be blowed in this particular
connection. Land-boomer doesn't bite land-
boomer except in the way of business, nor does
the director of one building society perceive
much urgent necessity for attempting to prove
that the director of another building society has
waxed fat on the nmi of its shareholders. Not
as public life in Victoria goes, anyhow. Colonel
Templeton’s plucky prosecution of sundry
“ representative ” persons had alarmed the
Legislature, and in refusing to further carry on
the business which was forced upon the “State”
a few months ago, and which the “State”
hadn’t sufficient brazen impudence to wind up
at the time, Messrs. Munro and Co. are acting
according to their lights.
* * *
True, the Argus has said that “ a gross
failure of justice will occur unless the question
of the criminality of Doherty and Gourlay is
finally set at rest, either by conviction or
acquittal,” and the general public are muttering
expressions of unqualified disgust at street
corners. The unusual circumstance of the
Argus being on the popular side counts for
nothing in this fishy case. Besides, the Age—
that influential, disinterested and deeply-
respected friend of the taxpayer—has never
ceased to point out that the prosecution of its
“ blood relation ” and the other defendants was
a shameful waste of money, and an outrage upon
political economy. At first the Age shrieked
for the stoppage of proceedings on the ground
that they were bringing more ruin upon im-
poverished widows and orphans, depending
upon the mangled assets of the P.B.A. for the
means to bury themselves respectably. When
the Government had to stand the racket it
became necessary for the Ag e to shift its solici-
tude from the widows and orphans on to the
main body of taxpayers. And, as if deter-
mined to “give itself away” altogether, the
organ of Mr. David Syme has affected
to faint over the discovery that the
taxpayers of Victoria have been victimised
to the extent of £2o,ooo—or, say, two
shillings and ninepence each. Consider-
ing that Gillies has but recently finished
pouring hundreds of thousands of pounds down
the political sink, and that a cool million of
money is to be expended altogether upon Par-
liament House, few taxpayers would have
objected to spending another shilling or two on
the “conviction or acquittal” of Doherty or
Gourlay, a goose-gorged jury having put every-
body else beyond the reach of retribution.
* * *
One word more. Whilst the Court was wait-
ing for the verdict a newspaper reporter ap-
proached Purves, Q.C., and asked whether
further proceedings would be abandoned in the
event of the jury disagreeing. To which ques-
tion Purves replied that the Government
couldn't drop the charge until it was satisfac-
torily cleared up, and that, in the event of the
Government doing what it couldn’t do (but has
done) he, Purves, would have some pertinent
remarks to make. We are now panting to hear
those pertinent remarks from Purves.
The Tyrant from Brummagem.
Mr. Willis, M.P., having failed to “draw”
Premier Sir Henry Parkes by a series of
Sydney newspaper diatribes which would have
evoked legal thunderblasts from any other
public man beneath the sky, now announces
that he is about to stab that virtuous old
gentleman under the fifth rib by printing a
pamphlet containing a full and accurate
account of all that is known about H. P. and
distributing the same all over the earth—more
particularly in the quarters concerning whose
opinion H.P. is particularly sensitive : among
editors of the various British newspapers and
journals and members of the ’Ouse of Lords and
Commons. Lord Knutsford, the British Secre-
tary of State, to whom Mr. Willis is appealing
concerning his removal from the New South
Wales Commission of the Peace, is, we read, to
be fully instructed in Parkesiana.
# * *
When W illis friend Bloxham became a
•1.P., lie swore allegiance to Queen Victoria,
but not to the Prince of Wales ; nevertheless
Parkes has removed him from the Commission
of the Peace for having said nasty things about
that bloated boon companion of the infamous
Earl of Aylesford, the not less contemptible
Duke of Marlborough and others of a like
kidney. As the glorified turner from Brum-
magem and his colleagues have extended to
Albert Edward of Wales a consideration
generally understood to appertain to reigning
royalty alone, it would be well to know where
Parkes draws the line ? Is it, for instance,
penal in New South Wales to disparage that
State-fed pauper, Battenberg V Is the
memory of the late J. Brown a sacred thing in
Botany Bay ?
** * #
Parkes should have mailed Willis’ alleged
libels to the British Treasury solicitors, with a
view to their taking such steps as they might
deem proper in vindication of Tummy’s charac-
ter. As Premier of New South Wales he was
in no way bound to protect the smudgy reputa-
tion of the heir-apparent to the British mon-
archy. Parkes, who has, as the world remem-
bers, himself vainly attempted to obtain from
an Australian jury that vindication which, as a
rule, a jury is only too ready to give to the
character of any honest and decent man, would
do well to look after his own reputation instead
of using such practically irresponsible powers
as he unfortunately at present possesses as
instruments of toadyism and paltry tyranny,
* *
Mr. \\ illis cannot legitimately growl at
being dispossessed of his J.P. ship. As his
newspaper, to which lie had bumptiously
attached his name in big black letters after the
fashion of journalistic amateurs, had been the
vehicle of a frantic appeal to the people of the
country to take up arms against the existing
legislative authorities, of which he himself was
a paid unit, Parkes hit him at once, just as a
man hits you when you challenge him to fight.
But the removal of Bloxham is quite another
matter. If you summarily penalise a J.P. for
maligning the Prince of Wales, you might
just as well penalise him for speaking ill of the
Czar, who is brother-in-law of the Duke of
Edinburgh, the brother of the Prince of
Wales.
* * *
The Bloxham incident casts a lurid light on
the sort of relations which the arch-apostle of
“ Federation under the Crown ” would fain
establish between the free and independent
people of Australia and the commonplace and
selfish brood of Germans who so long have
fattened on the stupidity of the British people.
Australia, we think, will hardly accept any
scheme of Federation held out to it in the right
hand of a vain old humbug who, in his left hand,
clutches a gag to be applied to the right of free
speech. We hope to see Albert Edward come
to Australia and prosecute Editor Bloxham. If
he does, he will get just as fair a trial as was
given to H. Parkes on the occasion when the
latter so dismally failed in his attempt to have
Editor \\ ebb put into gaol. The illustrious
personage who wrote to his friend Lady Mok-
daunt to “ lay up for another fortnight ” will,
we say, have a much fairer trial than that given
to the lunatic who, when Parkes was in office
many years ago, s''ot the Duke of Edinburgh
at Clontarf.
* # *
T’he conduct of Parkes in connection with
the O’Farrell case, the Proctor case, the
Walker case, the Bloxham case, the Socialist
lecture case, and a score of other cases has been
such as to brand the shallow old posturer as a
conscienceless political tyrant and as a sneak of
the very first order. His interference vyith the
Socialist lectures on the ground that they are
“ blasphemous,” is an effectual exposure of his
own ignorance. Even were they what is known
as blasphemous, it is difficult to see how that
could warrant Governmental interference in a
community where Church and State are happily
not united. Parkes belongs to that breed of
tyrants who carefully select their victims from
among those presumably incapable of serious
resentment.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
For Ever and Ever.
There is no end to the drivel of the cablegram
fiend, and his parochial intelligence rises-
superior to all considerations of time or space
or ordinary human probability. For instance,
the following mighty hunk of lore comes out as
a recent sample :
H.E.H. the Duke of Clarence, who was yesterday
installed as Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons
for Berkshire, warmly welcomed Lord Cari.noton back
from New South Wales. Lord Carington, in reply, pre-
dicted that Australia would for ever remain loyal to
England.
For ever and ever ! Lord Carington has said
it with a weary yawn upon his open counten-
ance, and the flabby little duke, whose face is
as expressionless as an African’s feet, has
accepted the statement with a profound “ haw,’’
and the cable has endorsed it, and the S.M.
Herald has published it; and therefore Time
petrifies and Progress falls into a cataleptic
state, and Change becomes unchangeable for
ever and ever. Everything else in earth
and sea and sky is unstable and
transitory. The hills are being fast
frittered away and washed into the sea, and the
sea is silting up into uew r mountain ranges, and
England itself is dissolving and sinking into the
Atlantic, till in course of time there will be
nothing but water from Labrador to the Skager
Rack, and even the Pole Star is drifting away
into the far recesses of the heavens ; but when
everything else is lust and gone the kawlinies
will still remain loyal to England, for Caking -
ton dropped in as he was going past and
mentioned the fact. Somewhere about a century
and half ago most of North America was a’s >
in a state of eternal loyalty to the British
Crown, and most of South America was as
devoutly attached to Spain ; and 200 years ago
England was the perpetual pensioner and
dependant of France ; and (100 years further
back she was the humble slave of Normandy
and was to remain so for ever and ever ; and
in a still more remote era she was loyal to Rome
with a loyalty that was to endure through
all time and eternity, but all these
things died away, and every “ loyal ”
sentiment that ever bound one country to
another since the first beginning has proved


more transient than a snowball in Gehenna, or
a vague hypothesis written upon the sea in
letters of foam. But though nothing else is
permanent, the loyalty of the colonies is to keep
on through all ages, for, as already mentioned,
Carington has said it, and the flea has shaken
its foot at the stars and told them to keep
where they are till further orders, and the fly
lias grabbed the tail of the universe and is
holding it steady. It is a joyous thing to
possess so much information, and when we con-
sider what a heap Carington knows, we feel
sad over the ignorance of the prophets and the
desperate stupidity of the apostles, for they
could only see a few years ahead, while Baron
Smith glares down au unending futurity, and is
either three parts omnipotent or else an ass.
The Maoriland Labour Victory.
Despite much hard lying to the contrary, the
recent elections in New Zealand have resulted
in a gigantic victory for the cause of Labour.
The last Parliament, elected under the old
system of plural voting, contained no Labour
party whatever ; in the present Parliament 24
out of the 74 members have been returned on
this issue alone, and thus the new party is
already as strong as either of the old ones.
Under these circumstances there is already
much talk about the necessity of forming a
Coalition Ministry out of the wreckage of the
Atkinson and Ballancb factions, as the only
means of carrying on the government—which is
a simple but high-class mode of stating that it
is time for Property to sink its own differences
and devote itself to squashing the common
herd. For a good many years the present
Government and the present Opposition have
raged unceasingly at each other and called
down all the demons of thunder and political
smash upon each other’s heads, and each has
proved conclusively that the country Avas lost,
and could only be saved by Atkinson keeping
his billet and his salary or by Ballance
getting them, as the case might be.
There was no visible difference between their
policies, and they both issued a big placard
Avhen an election was in progress stating that a
judicious system of retrenchment Avas badly
Avanted, and when Atkinson announced, amid
tremendous excitement, that another £2O a
year had been saved by reducing the salary of
the metropolitan dog-drowner, Ballance would
manifest his economy by moving for a reduction
of £5 more ; but they got on very Avell and drew
their honorarium satisfactorily even on these
scanty materials, and each was resolved to fight
to the last gasp and fall nobly amid the
applause of a frenzied earth Noav that a third
party has appeared on the scene, hoAvcA’er, this
old arrangement has fallen through; the two
original combatants are both bidding for the
support of the Labour members, but if neither
of them can get it they intend to resolve that
they have held exactly the same views all along,
and that their apparent enmity Avas merely an
optical illusion ; and then they Avill weep tears
of joy and toss up for the jobs and the salaries.
But if, on the other hand, either Atkinson or
Ballance can get the support of the Labour
party by making a general promise to
do something of a large, hazy, democra-
tic character at some unspecified period
in the future, and can thus secure the loaves
and fishes for himself by giving the shadow of
the crusts and the dim reflection of the fins and
tails to his new supporters, then he will issue
a manifesto stating that his rival is practically
a liar and a hog, and there Avill be no Coalition
for the present. But by-and-bye the Labour
representatives Avill find out that they have been
sold, and will fall aAvay from the alliance, and
then Atkinson or Ballance, as the case may
be, Avill explain that the liar was a misprint and
that he was wrongly reported in the matter of
the hog. Whereupon Ballance or Atkinson,
Avhoever may be on the other side, will accept
the explanation eheei’fully—provided He can’t
get the Labour A r ote himself ; but if he can get
it then he will denounce his opponent—
whichever it a loathly worm, and
Avill set up for himself, and thus he
will either advance or retreat with great
brilliance as the affair may turn out, and a
great conflict Avill be either brought about or
aA r erted—it doesn’t matter which. The moral
of all this is that the Labour party has gained a
great victory in securing 24 out of 74 seats, but
until it has au absolute majority of its own the
results will not amount to much. Its opponents
may curse and wrangle a good deal among
themselves, but they are always solid on the
great cause of Proputty, and though they may
scream for a good many other diverse principles
the great principle of land and hard cash and
bricks and mortar Avill invariably find them
unanimous.
The Amalgamated Blackleg.
The cheap, unassuming blackleg, who enabled
the capitalist to squash the cause of Labour in
Melbourne on the understanding that he was to
receive eternal gratitude and constant employ-
ment, has been so completely thrown overboard
that he now proposes to form an organisation of,
his own, and announces his intention of
suppressing the thankless boss who has ejected
him into the gutter. In his capacity as a loose
and unattached groveller he finds that he is
only a thing to be kicked, and therefore he has
awakened to the necessity of being an amal-
gamated groveller instead. He does not intend
to become an ordinary unionist, however, for
bis only claim upon the capitalist is that he is
the enemy of unionism ; it is merely proposed
to form an “Association of Free Labourers : ”
and as his principles forbid him to be faithful
to any association, even his own, this league is
likely to prove an unattached combination of
loose atoms, and the devil will take the hind-
most. Moreover, it is impossible that he can
be a free labourer and yet a unionist, and
equally impossible that he can belong to his own
association and yet be a free labourer, and
therefore he seems to have abolished himself
and become nothing at all—not even a black-
leg. What liis precise status will be in the next
dispute remains to be seen. The old unions
decline to recognise him because he fought
against his own class and Avreeked his own
•ause for the sake of a mere temporary adA'an-
tage, and the masters refuse to acknowledge
him because they have won, and are in a posi-
tion to throw their used-up instrument away.
If his new organisation sends an ultimatum to
the employers, the brief response will be, that
the said organisation may go to Hades. Its
members are not wanted by either side, and if
they strike, nobody will get any more excited
over the event than if it was a strike of associ-
ated cannibals, who refused to pursue their
avocations unless they were furnished with more
succulent missionary. Possibly, some eight or
ten months hence, there may be another great
labour difficulty, and then —if the association of
“Free Labourers” is still in existence —it may
get a chance to go blacklegging in its individual
capacity, but if it attempts to act as a
corporate body, the floating labour of the
province will take its job, and it will be left
out in the cold. The amalgamated blackleg is
an anomalous individual with no fixed status.
He jumped the claim of the unionist, and is
surprised to find his own claim jumped in turn,
and he has to form a union as the only means
of asserting his position Us an unattached ‘ ‘ free
labourer ” who objects to unionism, and in his
capacity as an organised loose non-unionist and
a member of a disunited society in which every-
body scrambles for himself he complains of the
still more disunited blackleg who does to him
exactly what he did to everybody else. He is a
compound of contradictions a dismounted
marine horseman in the air—an individual who
rises up sitting in a horizontal attitude to unite
separately as a dissevered combination for the
suppression of unity ; and the one lesson to be
derived from him is that blacklegging is a
failure, as it always has been, and that the
capitalist only keeps his promises when it suits
him to do so—an event which happens at long
intervals and not always even then.

The first beginnings of Constitutional Govern-
ment in West Australia were celebrated in
Berth by the old, inevitable banquet, and one
or two ominous symptoms turned up in the
course of the feed. The guests cheered for the
Queen, as usual, but they cheered in a dull,
uninterested way as if they were cheering for
dry bread, or hash, or were applauding their
creditors, or performing some other act that
must be got through with difficulty. Also they
drank the health of the Governor in a solemn
style as if they were drinking cold tea to the
memory of their aged grandmother, and made
speeches about him with just as much enthusiasm
as if they were making speeches about the
necessity of putting on their clothes in the
morning. But when a member rose unexpectedly
lian Commonwealth, the applause that followed
and talked of the future destiny of the Austra-
nearly blew the roof off the premises. Even in
the slow-going West the alleged ‘ ‘ tie ” that binds
is evidently getting worn down veiy thin, and
the invisible “ bond” is a hazy thing of fluff and
uncertainty.

Melbourne Argus includes Australia among
“ the scattered branches of the English race,”
thus supplying an instance of a very common
misapplication of terms. Americans form as
much one of “the scattered branches of the
English race ” as do Australians, but we do not
suppose that even the magnificent ignorance
or wilful perversity of the Argus would apply
such a term to the people of the United
States with their ten millions of Germans, ten
millions of Irish, ten millions of niggers, and
the millions upon millions of French, Dutch,
Spanish, Italian and Polish people who are in-
corporated in the citizens of the roll of the
Great Republic. Further, when it is applied (as
it is done in the case quoted) to Australia as
something to be considered “ nationally,”
then the Argus might as well and
probably would—call India a “scattered
branch of the English race.” As a fact,
Australians are not English. A very respect-
able minority are anti-English. As one
instance, there are whole communities, both
in South Australia and in Queensland, whose
citizens are Germans first, Australian second,
and English not at all. A Queensland ex-
Premier once publicly accused a Teutonic colo-
nist of coquetting with the Fatherland to sell
Queensland to Germany. It was a burlesque
lie, of course, but the fact remains that such an
absurd statement should be possible with even
the most excitable of responsible politicians.
Australians are cosmopolitan as yet and omni-
absorbent. We have not yet developed the
full Australian type, because we are growing
and sucking in fresh pedigree sustenance all
round. But we deny that Australians are
English. The English deny it also. Ask
Toorak or Potts Point.
The Hawk.es Bay Herald (N.Z.), a newspaper
owned by a few land-monopolists has been going
into hysterics over the appalling iniquity of
the editor of an Auckland labour-organ, who
refused to pay back rent for an old office which
lie had occupied for a few weeks under a mis-
apprehension, thinking it was part of the
premises where his paper was printed, and that
it consequently belonged to it. The Herald
sees in this little incident the awful conse-
quences likely to result from the teachings of a
stormy Democrat should men like him be re-
turned to Parliament. A striking commentary
on the Herald’s remarks is to be found in the
bare fact that several of its own proprietors or
shareholders arc included in a list of 38 persons
in Hawkes Bay who are in illegal possession of
nearly a million acres of land for which they
nave been vainly attempting to obtain titles
from the colonial Parliament for several years
past. When they are called on to pay their
back rents there will be some big cheques
wanted.

Balfour, M.L.A., a cast-iron Christian with
an egg-shaped head, recently informed a
gathering of Melbourne pietists that “the
success of his countrymen is attributable to the
fact that the Bible is the spring of all their
actions.” In reply to which characteristic
snuffle an infidel might point out that the
Biblical definition of “success” is hardly the
same as James Balfour’s. It may be laid
down as a general rule, however, that the
Scotch in the bulk do use the Holy Book as a,
kind of spring-board, after having carefully
noted that the 12 fishermen of old made little
or no money in business. But one very impor-
tant reason why Balfour’s countrymen prosper
above the average is practically illustrated
every New Year’s Day. A pure-bred Scotch-
man can drink an Irishman or Englishman into
the gutter, without ever experiencing a desire
to throw his money about. Anyone may save
his saxpences by the un-Christian device of
swearing off it, but no other class of man in the
world can grow rich whilst he is steadily paint-
ing his nose. The Scotch are awful hard in the
upper storey.

Op one thing in connection with the Victorian
Premier Permanent cases Australia has reason
to be proud : the attitude and demeanour of
Chief Justice Higinbotham throughout the
lengthy trial.’* The clearness, fairness and
manliness of his Honor’s charge to the jury,
and the conspicuous way in which humanity
and strict justice were combined in the anti-
sentence remarks made to the convicted defen-
dants, form a model for all time to occupants
of the judicial bench. In this respect, at least,
the trial will certainly be “historical.”
A lady who wants the franchise badly sends
along to The Bulletin the old complaint that
manhood suffrage puts women of no matter how
exalted genius below the most illiterate boor ;
and as she finds this illogical, she calls on the
civilisation of the 19th Century to sweep the
barbarous system into the dust-bin of the past.
This is very fine, it is rather old ; and it just
illustrates one of the strongest arguments
against giving votes to women. A woman’s
mind is so constituted that she believes in the
possibility of finding a system that would not
be illogical, and she would always vote to upset
any that didn’t come , up to her standard. No
doubt our correspondent thinks that it would
be easy to draw up a plan of electoral repre-
sentation which would distribute voting power
in exact proportion to the fitness for it. It
would never occur to her that even her system
of female suffrage would make no distinction
between a woman of bad character and the wife
of a Minister of the Crown.
The collapse of the strike of railway employes
in Scotland was sufficiently explained by a
cable message—“ Engine-drivers are being lent
to the companies by the Midland Railway
Company.” It is only reasonable to suppose
that the Southerners were praying in sequestered
nooks and corners for the success of this hasty
Scotch attempt to get touch, however slight, of
an eight-hours system, yet at the bidding of a
bloated board of directors the men pocketed
their sympathies, and went off to perform what
was virtually “blackleg” labour. Probably
the Midland magnates netted sixty per shent
interest on the temporary loan of their easily-
driven drivers, or perhaps they obliged their
brethren for love, pure love, of the great cause
of Capital. The cable is silent on this point.
It merely says that the necessary loan was
floated, and until further particulars come to
hand, we can but remark that the English
engine-drivers might as well have been omnibus-
horses, placed by one company at the disposal
of another company that had happened to get
the glanders into their stables.
The vaccination dispute has received au
additional impetus by the arrival of the ship
Kelton at the Melbourne Heads with 31 souls
aboard, all of whom have had or still suffer
from small - pox. Dr. Elsnek, the chief
champion of the compulsory vaccinators, de-
clares that his position is confirmed by a refer-
ence to this especial ease, as each seaman had
been vaccinated, and only one man, i.e., 3*J 0
per cent., succumbed. It is a great pity that
the anti-vaccinators do not define their attitude
properly. No one doubts for a moment that
vaccination gives almost perfect immunity from
virulent small-pox. What the dissentients to
compulsory vaccination should stand or fall by
is this : That the operation causes a specific
disease known as variola, which malady is
rarely fatal to life, but which inevitably im-
pairs the constitution as a whole, and leaves the
patient unduly susceptible to all the diseases to
which the flesh is subject, with the one solitary
exception of small-pox. The question, there-
fore, summarized, is this : Is it worth while
debilitating the average national constitution in
consideration of the immunity against small-
pox gained, and are the numbers of indirect
diseases caused by variola of less account in
proportion ?

One of the most shamefully-coddled classes in
New South Wales is the junior barristers’— i.e.,
such of them as happen to be “fashionable”
and in the good graces of the Crown Law*
authorities. From all we hear, the Parlia-
mentary Draftsman, admittedly a clever officer
who, considering his abilities and his work gets
a very moderate salary indeed, has from time to
time thrust upon him the alleged “ services ” of
one or other of the army of well-tailored poor
creatures—chiefly imported—who under the
guise of practising at the “Baw” are in reality
the involuntary sucklings of a much-milked
State. To these youths are from time to
time given bills to *‘ draft. ” The Parliamentary
Draftsman smiles a bitter and cynical smile
when he hears that Mr. Slopechin (whose
professional experience has exclusively consisted
in moving probates and defending niggers on
Crown briefs) is to gel 300 guineas for drafting
a bill for the purpose of Suppressing Con-
structive Blasphemy on the part of Cock-eyed
Grasshoppers, but he can’t well protest, and
meekly, revises (which generally means re-
writing the whole of) Slopechin s bill. And
with what celerity is Mr. Slopechin’s huge
honorarium for the Strabismussed Insects Anti-
Blasphemy Bill rushed through as compared
with the cheque claimed by some poor devil
of a Government contractor up to his eyes in
bank-overdrafts !
There is trouble in (he Y.M.C.A. camp in
Melbourne. Certain imported members wrote
complaining that Secretary Southwell does
not sufficiently exert himself on their behalf,
and ignbres the interests 6f new* arrivals when
they come into conflict w ith those of the native
article. The secretary rejoin that no class-
distinctions are observed, and repudiates “a
predilection for mashers.” New comers bring-
ing letters of introduction from the old country
expect to be provided with situations right off
the reel. They arrive in large numbers and are
mainly composed of clerks and drapers’ assist-
ants, of which Victoria has more than enough
for its requirements already. There is no cool-
ness shown to these gentry, whose main com-
plaint is that the giving of f ree meals is unduly
limited. As a final retort, Mr. S. concludes
with the remark that ‘ ‘ there is a ring of hearti-
ness about the Association which makes every-
one feel at home if it is possible for him to do
so.” The whole affair throws a lurid light en
the functions and inner life of the tame-cat in-
stitution.
The proud boast of the new Victorian Govern-
ment that it will conduct its future railway
operations “on commercial principles” evokes
admiration among the moderately intelligent.
When a community, finding that its railroad is
not bringing in profits, “sacks” forty general
hands whose total salaries are below the pay
of a single commissioner, in order to “cut
down expenses,” it usually means that to save a
cash deficit in the balance-sheet comprehensive-
ness and efficiency of railway conveniences are
to be diminished. It is a strange philosophy of
economics that bases its raison d’etre on the
principle that to increase production the
number of producers must be decreased. It
would seem more reasonable that one man
drawing a big salary should receive his walking-
papers, than that hundreds of men should be
thrown on the unskilled labour market to
become a burden to that society which Govern-
ment presumably represents. The labour of
the porter being quite as exhaustive of tissue
as that of the commissioner or inspector, no
difference should be made in the remuneration
supplied, and until the State realises that the
true principle of economic working must be
prefaced by fairly proportioning the salaries of
the top employes to those of the bottom, their
false economy will provoke jeers and dis-
content. Just noAv it suggests the tactics of the
drunken man who thinks that by walking fast
he may deceive the bystanders into considering
him sober.

The resolution moved by Mr. Ha when, M.P.,
to the effect that the notorious carvings on the
fa§ade of Sydney General Post-office be not
removed except by the authority of Parliament,
having been carried by 54 votes to 5 in the
New South Wales Assembly, that body may
be taken to have approved by the majority
indicated of the unspeakable brutalities in
question. There are no words in the
English language, nay f there is no language
or combination of languages in which could be
adequately expressed the artistic degradation
of a country whose chosen i - epresentatives could
lend their countenance to such blood-curdling
atrocities. The carvings are to Australian
sculpture what the froggy - loggy - doggy verses
of their arch-apologist, Premier Sir Henry
Paekes, are to Australian poetry. There is
but one consolation in connection with these
hideous affronts to the spirit of civilisation :
there is nothing Australian about them. They
were'originally conceived by a Scotch gentle-
man in a haggis-nightmare, and they were
executed (which, in connection with Botany
Bay sculpture, is an excellent word) by an
Italian carver bearing the suggestive name of
Sant.

Premier Munro, of Victoria, has declared for
the principle of “ one man one vote,” and next
session will probably see the beginning of a
great battle between the old Conservatism of
Gillies and the newly-acquired Liberalism of
the Government. It is the first time for over
seven years that any Victorian Ministry has
possessed an idea or a policy, and but for the
restless versatility of Shiels, who keeps the
stagnant boss-capitalist of the Cabinet supplied
with thinking power, it is moi’e than probable
that Munro would never have known how to
commit himself either on this point or any
other. He is essentially a dreary individual of
commissions and percentages and advances on
good “shecurity,” and his idea of statesman-
ship consists chiefly in loafing, after Gillies's
fashion, in a comfortable chair, and drawing his
salary, and affably promising the whole earth
to every deputation that asks for it. But,
unhappily, Gillies, though he does nothing
while in office, and is constitutionally incapable
of drafting even a resolute policy concerning
the removal of a mud-punt, raises perpetual
Sheol while in Opposition unless his opponent
keeps in constant motion; and Munro, who
nearly died of old age in the frantic effort to
make Duncan do something, will now find it
difficult to get time to eat and sleep through
Duncan's frenzied demands that he should
bring forward at least one insurrectionary
proposal every day, and a deep, profound
and comprehensive scheme of reform three
times a week. The difference between this
old, smiling Conservative while at the
head of a department, and the same
individual at other times, is precisely that
between a flash of lightning and a pint of mud.
The grass and the green moss grow on Gillies
while in office, and he loafs along wearily like
an exhausted mass of fat and wretchedness, but
when some one else is in office he devours time
and space in his frantic desire to make the
other fellow abbreviate a straight line so as to
get at bis object. The new Ministry already
suffers from the fact that its opponent is
shoving violently behind, and as it must do
something, the abolition of plural-voting is as
good a thing to attempt as anything else. The
Munro Cabinet already feels that it is likely to
fall against something at an early date, and it
is a matter of comparative indifference which
hard substance it may concuss upon.
Darkest England 1 Why is it darker than
Darkest Africa, and why not Darkest Russia,
Germany, or France? Is this the fruit of the
gdorious Freetrade regime I This rush to General
Booth is prompted by fear of the revolution,
which nothing can avert. The people want to
freeze on to the plunder, and must be choked off
somehow. Chuck t v em a bone ! Why not plant
the first colony in Westminsterkad .

' 846 Macquarie-strcct No; th, Sydney, Jan. 7,. 1891.
Mv Dear Moorarinda,-
At Sydney Criterion they evidently have an idea that
the eloping married female and the bold bad lover are a
suitable Xmas symptom, for last year at this time
“Fribnds” was the prevailing distress, and this year
“ Impulse ” is revealed behind the “ rag.” Maud William-
son made her Sydney debut in the limp r6le of Mrs. Mac-
donald, and isn’t so damp and repentant as the tearful
part permits, but she is placed in a contemptible light
from the commencement, and one really can have no
sympathy for a gasping creature who bestows her versatile
affections on a mounseer who so obviously paints his'
erotic nostrils a pale shrimp-pink. In the first act the
Williamson wears a mossy-green garment in velvet and
silk in the “ art ” style ; Enson—who is always Enson, but'
always lovely—in a neat gown of dove-grey with a white
vest. In the third act Miss Williamson, who is rather too
pokerish for draggy tea-frocks, and whose pull-the-st riug-
and-the-figure-sits-down poses are as sudden as a regi-
mental drill, comes forth in pale-ivory figured pongCe, the
full sleeves and front of pale-pink mull caught at the
waist with a brilliant buckle ; Enson wearing lobster-red
completely covered with soft grey chiffon and finished off
with black ribbon velvet—a strikingly Prenchy dress. In
the last act Williamson is in cream silk and mull flounces
that ought to be handed over to the laundress and the
crimping-iron, and Enson wears yellow and sage-green
as confidently as if we had never seen it before.
There was nothing very lovely in the d.c. on New Year’s
Eve. . A well-known doctor’s wife was there with a big
grey ostrich fan, and the sentimental angle of the latest
theatrical bride on to the starched bosom of her clean-
shaved Poppet suggested what a blissful honeymoon they
must .have had.
In a "paragraph chopped brief,” who can show in ink
relief the splendour, the riches, and pomp of “ Gin
derella?” All through the scintillating scenes everybody
has on a wedding garment—Vera Patey’s purple velvet
and satin, mauve silk and gold filagree and her black satin
and coral turnout with very slick black fleshings in the
last act: Lena Salinger’s flesh-pink and silver filagree and
lace suiting with the pale orange and silver thrill of the
other dandy, Sophie Harris, being especially worth notice.
Then we have pretty Aggie Kelton in white satin and
silver front, and long court train of silver brocade and
the glittering little shoelets, of course. Harry Benham,
as King Quartz—the villain of the trouble, who rushes in
and strikes a menacing attitude at virtue and goes away
crushed by.a fairy with a cockatoo profile in a stunning
rig-out—was a blinding sight with his marvellous golden
beard, and mantle of rich gold powdered material, and a
glittering vest to protect his “tuppenny” of golden
sequins ; really one ought to look at him through a piece
of smoked eclipse glass. The mythological “ transforma*
tions” are all beautiful, too—especially the concluding
one where the tense pose of the ascending Phoebus helps
the tableau amazingly—but I wonder why, in the third
change, does Charon, when he comes back from ferrying
Pandora over the Stygian river, assume the dejected
attitude of somebody hopelessly sea-sick ?
That was a whole-souled, forgiving, angelic sort of
bride aS.A. tnan took to be the guiding-star of his exist-
ence, in Adelaide, the other day. Hardly had they settled,
down after a blissful honeymoon than one fateful morning
there came a knock at their cottage door and a fine
healthy bantling was handed in, absolutely undressed, to
the care of the master of the house. Explanations were
deeply embarrassing, of course, for though most women
are willing to forgive past “ wild oats ” on the part of their
Petruchio when these cereals are but vaguely alluded to,
still a tangible “wild oat” weighing nine pounds handed
carefully in through the main door when it is least ex-
pected materially alters the complexion of things. Not
so, however, with this bride. Instead of sending the un-
welcome brat hurtling out on its bald head into the
gutter, talking shrilly for two hours and going hack to
her mother, she accepted the infant at once as one of the
family, placed it in a silk-lined cot, and said no more
about it! After all, women are ever so much more for-
giving than men. I wonder what he would have done if
three fat babies in a bassinette had presented themselves
at his front door three weeks after marriage and she had
confusedly confessed to there being romantic incidents in
her pre-nuptial career. Yes, I wonder if he would have
given them nursery-room?
Which reminds me, inversely, of an incident that once
happened at Manly, when two personages (then a second
Damon and Pythias, but afterwards to squabble over the
Pickwickian glory of being the originator of the Soudan
donkey expedition) were saved from dire dilemmas by
a marvel of a cook. At 6 p.m. Damon rushed in upon
Pythias, gasping: “My dear boy, I am simply on the
borderland of insanity ! I’ve actually invited six people
to dine with me to-night at seven o’clock, and then
forgotten all about it! It is now six o’clock. Suggest
something anything, for Heaven’s sake.” “1 can’t
suggest anything,” said Pythias, “ but 1 can lend you my
cook—if she’ll go to your house.” In a second cookie was
run up from the depths “ What have you in the house?”
was her first professional enquiry of the distracted host,
who Gushingly confessed that the ruins of a goose and
some milk were all there were to go upon. The female
Savarin smiled confidently, and said they might leave the
tiling to her. Then she went forth and bought within
ten minutes a heap of raspberry-tarts, some oysters, and
a fish. She concocted delicious oyster-soup within a
quarter of an hour more, scooped tiie jam out of the tarts
ami in vie them into oysler-patds for a second course;
cim ied l ie fish in some tricky way, until it smelt like the
Exchange at mid-day ; the goose-wreck she conjured into
toothsome entrees. She had dinner quietly on (lie table
three quarters of afrdinnr from warning, too, and the way
in which the dishes emptied proved the entire success of
her culinary jugglery. No wonder that—well, her master
is dead now, to the great grief of everyone who ever set
foot inside his house, and he used to tell this story himself
to lots of people—no wonder, I say, that when the cook
and he finally parted, he, after a vain endeavour to
re-engage her, “kissed her on both cheeks and gave her
his benediction.”
I read that they have just “ made a minnit,” or set up
a bye-law, or something, somewhere in Norway to the
effect that no fair Norwegian shall be united to the man
of her choice until she is “proficient in the arts of spin-
ning, knitting, and baking.” They ought to adopt that
imple little regulation throughout Australia. In my
mind’s eye, Horatio, I see the member who foster-fathers
the motion wept over and called blessed by a throng
coltou-socked, undarned, buttonless, and bilious Bene,
diets, mute sufferers from the fact that the cold-s vied
local " has merely to state she is sixteen to be
eligible to lay waste the wardrobe and ducks and
drakes of the digestive apparatus of the man who rashly
puts his trust in her.
People are wondering whether the youngest member of
an irrepressible Sydney family will behave as frantically
over the arrival of the “ Jarsey ” as she did over the land-
ing of the Carington? On that dim historic day she
rushed down to the wharf hearing a huge bouquet with
fluttering streamers to present to the lady, but-finding
that she could not squeeze up close enough personally to
offer the flowers, she galloped up to Government House
in a cab, stampeded past the astonished menials up to
Lady C.’s room, and dumped the bookay down on the
vice-regal bed. As mamma frequently avows, “her darling
child is so enthusiastic over everything,” so perhaps she
will go through the same performance for the benefit of
Lady J.
With a note of pained enquiry running through her
dulcet voice, yours truly rises to ask how it comes that a
troop of presumably rational girls are ever persuaded to
play cricket in public? The “Sydney ” and “ Probable ”
teams which met on Sydney Ass. Ground on
Boxing-day and the day following were a sorry sight
from their sunburnt cheeks to their heelless shoes, and as
they swaggered (doesn’t a woman just wag her back
draperies when she thinks she is mannish !) out into the
shimmering heat at the hot hour of noon each day one
couldn't help wondering where the fun of the thing
came in. And the attitudes ! The pose of one energetic
she-fielder suggested the “honey-pots” of childhood
with the suggestion of the last position of a leap-frog
back, and the way the batswomen careered from Dan to
Beersheeba drove home the truth of the saying that
women can’t run—“ Women and cows,” once wrote Mark
Twain (or was it Josh Billings?) “shouldn't run —they
can’t.” One cricketeress in (I think) navy-blue made a
very decent score of 195 on the first day, and 101 on the
second, and as she cleft the air, bat in hand and half
a yard of stocking showing at every convulsion, one felt
that Australians are evidently not all born tired. The
“Probables” won with 239 runs, and there were only
seven goose-eggs made on both days. The attendance
on the last day was very good, but society didn’t air its
summer complexion in the ladies' reserve, and the only
decent frock was a lilac delaine peppered with pansies
and topped with a string hat trimmed with heartsease.
Female cricket isn’t going to be fashionable.
The next she-tournament will probably be a “ladies’
billiard-match,” but as it has been on the cards for several
months the promoters may yet repent in season. I hope
they will, for the “lady players’” sakes. How could a
short fat woman be dignified when making a spread-eagled
dive at her ivory lying high and dry in the exact centre of
a full-sized billiard table ?
Several Australian musical professionals want to know
what a certain somewhat “literary ” lady meant by rush-
ing behind at a recent benefit concert and loudly lectur-
ing the performers, one and all, who weren’t too indifferent
to talk back. She nagged them for taking encores, said
she had no inclination to sit there all night j she quarrelled
over the length and quality of the progamme, and she
lectured a leading fiddler as if she were his mother-in-law
for giving an encore piece. Indeed, her angry shriek was
audible in the front seats, and sounded as if the soprano
and contralto were at last “ having it out.”
In reference to the steady tide of English professional
mediocrities who are capering about Australia while
hungry native ability sits twiddling its thumbs, a leading
Australian actress once said in reply to my puzzled query
why this was so;—“ This is how it is. Lots of managers
think the salaries they pay too enormous altogether, and
so they want to bring the price down by creating what
brokers call an ‘ artificial glut.’ When this market is
crowded out down go the salaries as they have done in
London.” “And what will become of the imported
sticks?” said I. But the leading actress simply shrugged
her shoulders and asked me as if I took sugar in my tea.
Unusual “wanted,” from the S.M.H.: —
TYTANTED, Board and Residence with elderly couple

woman. Three things absolutely necessary—viz,,
thorough respectability, no other boarders, and no
sons in family. Applications not fulfilling the above
no notice will be taken of them. Please address,

Reads like a “burnt child dreads the fire,” doesn’t it?
Has “ Bona Fide ” had her young affections blasted else-
where by the killing “English” boarder with the straw-
tinted moustache who vowed perpetual adoration every
evening in the small back parlour with the gas turned
down, and after all went off and married a soap-boiler's
fat widow? Or is it merely she doesn’t wish to jolt her
maiden meditations at the breakfast-table by the sight o
a row of fierce, hungry, commonplace men seizing all the
“ aigs” and bacon before she can wave a fork? “Bona
Fide” will probably be a long time hitting the exact
mark, unless the extreme suitability of a convent sud-
denly occurs to her.
The eighth annual meeting of the Sydney Nurses’Home
people occurred recently, with the Lieutenant-Governor
in the chair and the usual convoy of blushing philanthro-
pists in the front row, including Mrs. Gurney, who
tendered her resignation as hon. sec., as she shortly goes
abroad with Professor Gurney, In the submitted report
it transpired that the Home is looking rather blank just
now—more nurses leaving its tram-haunted precincts
than apply for admittance, and, as the Board must have
thirty nurses to build a dividend on, it was announced
that “ they had decided to try a system of profit-sharing,
which would give each nurse a pecuniary interest,” &c.,
&0., and the idea was received with considerable rapture
by the Sister Doras present. The Home won't have to
advertise any more for those thirty inmates, but I hope
the cloaked and veiled sisterhood have an eye to the
wordin') of the bond. “My dear,” says the good, kind
Board, “owing to an unsuspected juiiip in pork and -an
unforeseen rise in butter, combined with a strike on the
part of the laundresses for a further penny per dozen, wo
have to regretfully announce a slight deficit.”
And apropos to the Nurses’ Home, Sir Alfred Stephen
(who must have suffered all his life from an in ward craving
to do up his back hair, judging-by the wail in his opening
speech about .the ‘‘‘sox to avJuc'i .lie unfortunately
b longed”) propo'sed a very, .dresslfft-.thing to the as-
sembled “sisters.” He siiggvsfl.MUJyU'-Jlq-y should “read
selections to their patients.’’ Tints■ Js jqother terror added
to the siek-hed. The nurse will fqilow- h<-r own particular
literary promptings, of course, even it she lm« » thirst
that only morning “leaders” or evening “’errors” can
assuage, and it is possible that some freckled nightingale
of poetic habits will bring her manuscript along to the
bedside of some dying journalist, and then
With the advent of hot summer, the “ circle” fair ones
are throwing- appearances to the winds, and now at the
“critical” interval the seasoned swain returns with a
beaker of-I suppose in most oases-lemonade, to hi B
parched pansy-blossom, who receives it as gracefully as
does the frolicsome gallery girl receive the threepenny
squash as it is handed to her over the heads of the back
row. If the circle continues to cultivate a sixpenny
thirst, it would save escorts a lot of trouble if the “ ’E’re
y’are, applesorangesandlemon-a-a-de ” vendors were
licensed to go upstairs.

It is alleged that bank-manager Bennett
leaves behind him a shortage of £13,000. The
detectives say he did not escape to ’Frisco, and is
still in Australia.
Someone in a position to do so should
institute a searching enquiry into the reasons why
Mary Curran was recently released from gaol.
Last November she and her daughter were charged
with being accessories to an indecent assault com-
mitted by a Chinaman named Ping Song on a
child eleven years of age. Judge Windeyer, in
sentencing the female prisoners to five years’ im-
prisonment each, said that “ their crime was an
infamous one. For a few shillings they
had Consented to sell this child. Tile elder
prisoner, Mrs. Curran, who was a mother and an
Englishwoman, should have been the first to pro-
tect the child, instead of which she not only con-
sented to the infamous proposal made by her
daughter, but did all in her power to enable it to
be carried out.” At the time of the trial rumour
hinted that a certain relation existed between (lie
elder woman and a prominent Civil servant. His

“What is the dance, Mister?” said a
hayseed who leaned over the back of the Sydney
Royal circle while the ballet shivered, jelly-
fashion, on fat fantastic feet. “That,” said
we, judicially, “ is the cow-heel gavotte,” and he
was satisfied. As a matter of fact, J. Wilkinson
is the only one in the pantomime who displays
the slightest idea of dancing, and he, despite the
presence of Messrs. Greville, Forde and Boulton,
seems to be the only one who gets much fun out
of his part. This pantomime is also particularly
weak on the feminine side. Aggie Kelton has
little idea of handling Cindei’ella, and the others
are equally dotty. What are the Firm thinking
about? Here are 'the new importations—the
Misses Carew and Galbraith, both of whom, we’re
told, can sing and dance —lying idle, while George
Leitch has nothing to but pose as a block orna-
ment. The management announce an early
withdrawal of “ Cinderella ” in favour of Grattan
Riggs, who opens on January 31, probably in
“ Arrah-na-Pogue,” also underlined at the other
house.
*& * *
George Rignold is so enamoured of the
profits of pantomime that he has already put for-
ward “Babes of the Wood” as the bill for next
year, but whether he puts up that or any other
pantomime unless he has a little Maggie Moore in
it, we should want at least 80 per cent, of the
gross to stand in. Judicious excisions make
“ Dick Whittington ” go much easier, but we
think if Mr. Ayrton had a little less “fat,” and
Messrs. Hoyte, Tolano, Sweeney, and Harcourt
had a little more, things would hum more con-
sistently. By the way, Ayrton and Harcourt
lose a big show in the postal-pillar scene. Ayrton
might affect deafness and Harcourt could then
drop pink notes into his internals, or he might
open a glass .door in his side and ring him up by
telephone, or, drop pennies in his slots for taffy
and cigarettes. Instead of which they stand
round and talk vulgar drivel. A matinee per-
formance will be given on the 14th, and before the
season’s close the impecunious little ones of
Sydney will take their annual treat. When
“Dick” is wound up, date unfixed, “Arrah-ha-
Pogue ” will be produced, with Maggie Moore as
Arrah, and George Rignold as Shaun. Dion
Boucicault lends original MS. and music, and
may, also, appear in the cast.

“Moths” has drawn good houses at
Sydney Garrick, but nothing like the business
such a good show deserves. A second visit con-
vinced us that Olga Nethersole’s voice is responsive-
to every touch of feeling, and not the mere two or
three stringed instrument that the nervousness of
first night led us to believe. The lady’s chief
fault is her inclination to gasp. That’s a fatal;
habit; anyhow, one female gasper is enough in a
city. Laurence Cautley has a manner of treating
his terminal sounds which is particularly annoy-
ing, and the extra chew he gives his s’s is
neuralgia to us. Says the horse-reporter on a
contemporary : —“ Miss Lyons tries hard to appear
natural as Fuschia Leach, but the American;
accent is not appropriate to her style nor to the-
part. ”
A ton of ignorance is a dangerous thing,
And drinking deep makes dunces drivel sling. ,
“ Middleman,” the strong play by H. A. Jones, mi
which Willard made such a hit as the inventor
during its lengthy run at London Shaftesbury,
will be put up on Saturday next. Of course Chas..
Cartwright is the Blenkarn ; Harold Russell (first.
Sydney appearance) plays Sir Seton ; Hans Phil-
lips, Jesse Pegg ; Bill Leake, Bully Todd ; Mary
and Nancy, Olga Nethersole and Nellie Lyons
Mrs. Chandler, Jenny Watt-Tanner ; Maud!
Chandler, Alice Deorwyn, and last but not least,.
Harry Jewett, to fill an interregnum, plays a small!
part, Captain Chandler. One likes the new folk
at this house all the better because they do note
pose as stars and have made no attempt to earwig;
the press. This reminds us that we saw a Sunday
paper man once coming up the Royal stairs slob-
bering over his grimy paw. “ Sore hand ? ” said'
we, interrogatively. “No,” said he ecstactically
between kisses, “she squeezed it.” And we went
down thinking how much more appropriate ai
squeeze from a strait waistcoat would have been.
** * *
“ Impulse,” a weak play in the original,
has been further emasculated in English out
of compliment to “the bud.” The whole
plot of the piece turns on Mrs. Macdonald’s
(M iss Maud Williamson) exclamation, regard-
ing the arrival of her husband ; “ I dare not
see him ; take me away,” an acknowledgement of
her guilt with de Riel, and yet, afterwards, all
reference to this family unpleasantness is carefully
cut out. This straining at gnats weakens several
not over-strong situations at a later period.
“Harvest,” a not over-strong, but highly original,
play by H. H. Hamilton, in which Dot Boucicault
will make his re-appearance, will be put up on
Saturday. Scenery will be its trump-card.
At Madame Patey’s farewell Sydney con-
cert the Town Hall was nicely filled, but badly-
lit, and vocal chestnuts were very much in season.
By the way,'we would advise Mayor Burdekim
to provide the gallery with seats whose backs'
would prevent boors resting their feet on the-
spines of those who sit beneath them. The weak-
ness and bad enunciation of Patey’s vocal support
were never more in evidence, and Mr. Allpress was
so dissatisfied with the accompaniment to his first
item that he shirked the second. Perhaps the
accompanist had also cause to complain. Mr.
and Mrs. Patey, accompanied by Bertha Rossow,,
Jack Lemmone, and accompanist Morris, have
sailed for China and Japan. On return they play
in Queensland and Maoriland first.

now doing the three show towns on the way to
Melbourne. He then does Ballarat, Sandhurst

“Dandy Dick,” the frisky, thoroughbred
comedy that convulsed Sydney three months ago,
has been making the pace warm at Melbourne
Bijou since Boxing Night. The sternest stickler
for turf truth can find little to grumble at in the
story of “Dandy,” which hangs well together and
glitters with unconventional jokes. To the un-
thinking it may seem something of a pity that the
gaitered apostle doesn’t win his “monkey ” on the
“dead bird” after, all, yet Pinero doubtless
ordered all things for the best. He foresaw the
possibility of Anson gambling away his immortal
soul if that first essay at “ punting ” had not been
rendered abortive by the providential idiocy of the
family butler. Intoxicated with success the Dean
might have presently dropped the New Organ
Fund over a “certainty” that got “pipped on
the post,” or taken a short price about a “ stiff
’un ” with his next Hospital Sunday collection.
Under present conditions the moral that the
children of this world -as represented by sweet
George Tid and her loving baronet—are a
heap “downier” that the children of light
is driven right home by “Dandy Dick.” It like-
wise embodies a solemn warning to cooks who
woo carrotty-headed policemen with cold potatoes,
and is the incidental means of teaching us that
the horse is a nobler animal than an army-officer.
Miss Emma Temple, as one of the" Dean’s
daughters, is the only change from the original
B. &B. cast. Anson’s ripe performance possesses
special local interest, in so far that he makes up
outwardly on the lines of Dr. Bevan, although he
must despair of emulating that good shepherd in
the matter of spiritual grace. Brough makes a
welcome re-appearance, after quite a long absence,
as the muddled myrmidon of the law, and if Mrs.
Brough seems a trifle too fresh and charming for
a real “Daisy of the Turf.” she errs on the right
side. “ Dandy Dick ” will continue to run for the
Melbourne money, and romp in every evening
until further notice.
** * *
“Aladdin,” at Melbourne Royal, is more
or less of the pantomime seen in Sydney last
Christmas, and exchanged for “Cinderella” this.
Money has been expended upon the present pro-
duction with a liberal yet discriminating hand.
The public get as much splendour as they want,
but there is no wa.ste, and the Transformation
Scene comes to a mild artistic conclusion at the
very point where it is expected to begin. There
is a strange absence of gurgling fountains and
gushing fairies from this portion of the show, the
flying angels of ordinary pantomime life being re-
presented by painted figures upon which the
average old gentleman finds a difficulty in feasting
his filmy eye. The literary source of an
Australian “ annual ” was ever a mystery,
although the necessary localising is commonly
reported to be slung in promiscuously by a scene-
shifter, or somebody, who gets paid ten shillings
overtime for the job, Topical allusions without
the least suspicion of “snap ” in them, and songs
destitute of point or humour’, make “Aladdin”
hard to bear at times, but many of the lines—
probably by a man who is dead and can’t charge
for them —are unusually neat and rhythmical. So
is a well-appointed Fan Ballet, which supplies
Miss Mary Weir with another opportunity to
show how much she benefited by the example of the
Gaiety girls. Collectively considered, however,
“Aladdin” might have been given a better chance
to keep the Royal crowded after the holidays
are over and audiences have ceased to roll up
without fetching. Only George Walton, the
Widow Twankey, whose grotesque dancing and
fooling never, or hardly ever, grow wearisome,
seems to make anything of a hit. Jennie Lee and
Royce are merely at home in their very ordinary
business, whilst most of the others are chiefly re-
markable for a lack of “go.” It is worthy of
remark, though, that Miss Florence Young
appears happier and less constrained in tights than
when she wore skirts and wrestled with witty
dialogue in “The Gondoliers.”
** * *
Owing, perhaps, to the misfortune that
it is neither a comic opera nor a panto-
mime, “ Chilperic,” which failed to boom in
Sydney, is doing little better at Melbourne
Opera House. All the same, the management has
put forth a splendid effort to carry the town by
storm with Hervb’s extravaganza, and in artistic
excellence of production this glittering show holds
its own with the first setting-up of “Paul
Jones.” Maybe the strength of the com-
pany occasionally gives “ Chilperic ” away, inas-
much as that anyone who fully appreciates the
perfection of the quarrel-scene between Woodfield
and Nellie Stewart must weep anon over the
miserable foolery of Fredegonde’s departure from
Court, accompanied by a pile of bonnet-boxes on
a hand-cart. This is an irritating incident, which
goes far towards spoiling the charm of a perform-
ance that is bright and polished in the main,
assisted by a crowd of popular favourites dis-
played to tine advantage in their respective parts,
scenery, dresses, and legs of the best, and an
orchestra which deserves even the extravagant
praise heaped upon it by the dailies. There must,
be something seriously amiss with
“ Chilperic ” to account for the want of heartiness
in its reception. fAudiences don’t always trouble
to applaud items of undeniable merit. The subtle
sweetness of “The Bogie Man,” now worked into
the first act as “ The Druid Man,” and admirably
done by Snazelle, orchestra, and chorus, has been
very tamely received up to date. Probably the
Melbourne people are suppressing their hysterics
until the Gaiety Company come along with their
version of this droll song and dance.
** * *
“ The Phantom Ship,” at Melbourne
Alexandra, is a nightmare too disjointed and
gruesome to be reverently treated within the
limits of a paragraph. In reviving this alleged
supernatural drama (which is stated to have first
shaken its gory Jocks at Sydney), Dampier lias
made so many allowances for the festive season
that the non-appearance of a clown with a red-hot
poker causes a wave of mild regret to sweep
across the shattered understanding. Everyone
expects the grand final transformation scene to
dissolve into a butcher’s shop, where the Flying
Dutchman would be found driving a brisk
trade in wooden legs of mutton, but no-
thing of the sort occurs. Yet the drona.
abounds in Christinas joys so far as it goes. A
first-rate comic Baron, attired in full armour,
prowls around the streets of Amsterdam in pursuit
of Miss Lily Dampier, who inflames the warrior’s
tin-clad soul by persistently wearing the garb of a
Moorish maiden. A weird, mysterious gnome,
vaguely understood to be the primitive Dutch
notion of Nicodemus, appears to pursue the
wicked Baron except when he is spi-inging upon
Lily, but there is not much sense to be made of
this person anyhow. Dampier lias a pretty bad
time of it, popping up on icebergs and things and
discussing his awful doom in cold, impassive
tones, but in the end he seems to come out all
right through his son dying, and the Baron being
boofed off the old gnome. Take it altogether,
“The Phantom Ship” is a thrilling bit of fun,
with sundry flashes of song and dance thrown in
by way of adding serious interest to the tout
ensemble.

Meanwhile “ Marjorie,” pulled together
since the opening night, shows a disposition to
grow on ’em at Melbourne Princess’, and business,
after looking sickly on several previous occasions,
was immense on Saturday night. The solid
splendour of this old-Englishy ballad opera
received its due meed of gush in last issue. One
can find nothing fresh to say about the perform-
ance except that the orchestra, under Mr. Leon
Caron, goes occasionally mad and drowns the
vocalists, especially the baritone, in torrents of
brazen fury. The big drummer, too, would be
improved by dropping dead every now and then.

Matters are fairly lively at all three halls.
Frank Clark has got Perry and Lulu Ryan again
at the Gaiety, the U.S. niggers work hard at the
Victoria, while Harry Rickards’ farces and some
of his songs are new to Melbourne people, some of
whom are astounded to discover ’Arry’s capacity
for keeping a farce on the move without the
extraneous assistance of a roi'ty chorus. The
Cyclorama and other matters—such as the Exhi-
bition alligator—are raking in holiday returns,
but the Easting Man, having finished his 40 days
without degenerating into a ghastly spectacle,
is still on view at the Waxworks for the
moral benefit of all who take delight in
seeing a human being
take soup. Weather has
favoured Dr. Carver’s
“ Wild West Show,” at
the Friendly Societies
Gardens, and apart from
the buck-jumping—which
is suggestive of inferior
coals brought to New-
castle —this open-air en-
tertainment seems to
make a favourable im-
pression. Hopetoun has
given it his august
approval, and the man-
agement fires off a cheer-
ful conjecture that the
Sioux Indians engaged
have lost several relatives
and friends by the recent
slaughter in America.
This is a crafty advertise-
ment, because people na-
turally hanker to behold
any noble savage whose
uncle, for all they know
to thecontrary, may have
been recently buried in

TO Employers. —The Federated Employers Council

during the Strike ; amongst them are Carpenters, Stone-
masons, Gardeners, Farm Labourers, Carters and Black-

who have proved their reliability will be recommended.

There is no word in English quite to correspond with
the French Taf, which means a peculiar stage-fright

A correspondent clears up about Chas. Mathews, now a
prosperous London barrister, and the adopted son of old
Charley Mathews, the comedian, who was twice married,
first to the gay Vestris, secondly to Mrs. Davenport,
divorced wife of an American comedian, and she yet sur-
vives. The proper name of Mathews, the barrister, is
Davenport, son of Mrs. Mathews by her first husband,
who gave poor Charley such an unmerciful beating in the
street in New York ; but yet Charley loved the boy. The
comedian has been dead 12 years. His widow yet
decorates his grave, in Kensal Green Cemetery, with
flowers, and she also takes a pride in decorating the
grave of her predecessor, Madame Vestris, dead over SO
years.
Ada Cavendish, who was said to he dying a year or two

A Texas journalist named Keith has a beard seven feet

Beerbohm Tree has been saying that the proportion of
good plays to bad in those he reads is as one to one
hundred and fifty, and that the art of writing good plays
depends upon a technical acquaintance with the working
of the stage. But it is not unlikely that should other
managers go through the same lot of plays, they might
select several plays and ignore that selected by Mr. Tree.
Then, if stagecraft be the only essential, how is it that so
few actors are play-weights? What about the dozens of
good plays written by men who have scarcely stepped on
the boards ? What about the failures put together by the
stage-experienced ? As a matter of fact, stage knowledge
is useful to a play-wright, but is by no means indis-
pensable. A good manager can soon straighten out kinks
at rehearsal.

A brief mention that Nellie Leamar, of the London
music-halls, had married a son of the Earl of Feversham
appeared in last issue. The glad tidings were not news,
but as seven long years had elapsed since Nellie’s
nuptials were first announced in The Bulletin, it seemed
just about time to announce them again. The sisters
Leamar were the originals of the Sisters Bilton, and con-
sidering that one girl from each pair is now safely landed
amongst the old nobility, the advisability of such maidens
hunting in couples is quite obvious.
Painful surprise in Melbourne show circles over the
death of R. W. Cary, known as New Zealand Cary, not to
be confounded with W. G. Carey, the tragedian, or G. P.
Carey, the comedian. Little R. W. Cary gave up a pros-
perous news-agency in Richmond (Melb.) to embark on
precarious theatricals, after success as a penny-reading
manager. His baritone singing in New Zealand got him
some fame, and he even took parts like Mourzouk in
“ Girofle-Girofla.” He was luckless of late.
A bit of American swindling creeps up in Melbourne
show business. One travelling combination trading on

the Melbourne music-halls puts out six character por-
traits of a favourite comique who has gone to Europe.
Everyone remembers that cantankerous little tenor*
Dimitresco, the Roumanian, who was here with Simon-
sen’s last company, his wife being the attractive contralto
Madame Lablaohe, who sang “ Carmen”,so well. Dimi-
tresco left the stage in the middle of the last scene of
“Carmen,” at Melbourne Opera House, through a dis-
agreement as to tempo with Lombardi, the conductor,
and he played a like prank in Sydney, but such tricks
seem to be concomitants of getting on, for Dimitresco is
now a star of the London Italian Opera, Covent Garden,
under Signor de Lago.
Amazing is the way your Sims, Pettitt, Buchanan,

“ Cut-throat” is the game play'ed by certain managers
at this festive season. Most of the theatres are over-
manned. Each entrepreneur lias snapped-up all the
available people, fearing rivals should make profitable
use of them.
Miss Wallis, manageress of the Shaftesbury Theatre
(London), recently appealed to her audience for advice as
to continuing Buchanan’s new play, “The Sixth Com-
mandment.” When she remarked that she had not had
good houses during the week, a gallery voice yelled,
“No, but we hope to Gawd yer will have”—a wish that

C.M.G.-ship. We can only suppose that Parkes
got the bauble fastened ou to Walker’s manly
chest on the same principle that the historical fox’
who had lost his tail in a steel-trap, told all the
other foxes to lop their brushes.
According to the daily papers, Postmaster-
General O’Connor, backed up by Premier Parkes,
refuses to obey the injunction granted by the
N.S.W. Supreme Court restraining him from stop-
ping the passage through the post of a certain
newspaper declared by a stipendiary magistrate to
be obscene, until the publishers’ appeal be decided
by the Full Court. Defying the authority of the
Supreme Court appears of late to have become
quite a favourite game in high official quarters.
When once an open and formal challenge shall
have been made The Bulletin hopes that Chief
Justice Darley will have the necessary spine to
accept it by issuing warrants and [clapping into
gaol those alleged guardians of public morality
who claim to be above the law.
The lugubrious fiend who relapses once
per annum into long, piteous wails concerning
‘ ‘ the dying year, ” seemed to be taken rather worse
than usual on Wednesday of last week. He
rolled the old familiar “dirge,” or “lament,” or
“retrospect ” off his chest with exceptional vigour,
and its melancholy rumble resounded through the
cavernous gloom of the Australian Press like a
consumptive cough in a catacomb. He began, as
a rule, by groaning “The Year is Dying Fast,”
and then the wretch went on to gloat over its rapid
dissolution as though he were an undertaker.
Sometimes he stai-ted off with the gruesome chest-
nut “Hark! ’Tis Midnight!” He occasionally
varied the rnontony of his croak by letting us
know that “The Clock Strikes Twelve,” but he
was a mournful miscreant in any ease. It is about
time that editors left off encouraging the bard
who rhymes year with bier, drear, or tear, and
exhorts us to consign it to the sepulchre of the
past. He has been hanging like a pall over every
31st December since time was, and when the
present year dies we shall hope to see the would-
be warbler of a requiem wrapped in a winding
sheet of his own miserable screed, and buried with
the corpse of that defunct twelvemonth.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One of the men employed in Brisbane Botanic
Gardens was lately instructed by the Curator to
clean out a pond full of lilies and dirty water.
The person employed in this aquatic scavenging is
a Teutonic gentleman who has not made lethyo-
logy a special study. Consequently, when he dis-
covered four fishes of somewhat remarkable aspect
his first impulse was to cook and eat them. He is
probably related to that German colonist named
Meyers who turned back from Leichhardt’s second
expedition impelled by the paralysing dread that
he would not be able to obtain sufficient grub !
The Curator, however, was just in time to rescue
three of the fish from the ravenous Teutonic man,
and at once forwarded a couple, to DeVis, the
able Museum Curator, who recognised them
as “Burnett Salmon,” or Ceratodus Fosteri,
one of the most interesting life forms on this
planet. This extraordinary fish is only found in-
the Mary and Burnett Rivers on the East Coast
of Queensland, and nowhere else in this world.
The mystery of how these four came into the
Botanic Gardens is thus explained. About 18 or
20 years ago a German settler on the Upper Mary
River (named after Lady Fitzroy) caught several
Ceratodi in a net and took them down to Mary-
borough where the late Percy Ramsay purchased
the lot and was then advised by R, 13. Sheridan
to send them on to the Brisbane and Sydney
Gardens:. Four were sent to Brisbane and placed
in a Botanic Garden pond where they were for-
gotten for nearly 20 years until discovered by the
aforesaid Teutonic gourmand. They weigh now
from five to eight pounds each. The two sent to
the Museum were sent back at once to the
Gardens, where they are now living with their
third mate in a fresh pond near the duck-
lagoon. This Ceratodus represents one of
the earliest forms of life on this earth. He is
identical with the Ganoid fishes of the Triassic
and Jurassic Periods. His ancestors were con-
temporary with the Efepkas Prim-igcnius, with the
Megaceros, with the cave tiger, with the Icth/jo-
saurus, the Plesiosaurus, and the great leather-
winged carnivorous bat, the Pterodactyl , whose
fossils are found in the limestone of the Mesozoic.
This wonderful fish possesses not only the ordinary
breathing-gill of all fishes, but the lung of the air-
breathing animals. He is the connecting-link
between the cold-blooded fishes and the warm-
blooded mammalia. The scientific world first
received news of Ceratodus with the derisive
incredulity that greeted the announcement of the
platypus. The one had ceased to exist for 200,000
years and the other was an impossible absurdity !
The Ceratodus is, when full-grown, about 30 inches
long, and weighs from 81bs. to 121bs. His scales
are large, like those of the Barramundi of
the Dawson, but without the red spots
of the Dawson fish. They belong to totally
distinct species, though often confounded by
people who don’t know one from the other. The
sight of a live Ceratodus inspires me with the
same feeling that would arise if I took a walk
in the forest and met a Mastodon, or a Tichorine
Rhinoceros, or fell over a sick Pterodactyl. This
fish shares with the present Aurochs of the
Lithuanian forests, Bos/ongifrons, the entire
honour of representing life forms separated from
us by geological ages. Always, of course,
excepting Man, who dates back to the unicellular
Amoeba, which, according to Epigenesis, was the
primordial atomic globule from which, by long
process of development, heredity and adaptation,
have been evolved the book-agents, politicians,
land-sharks, and other human representatives of
the bowelless Protozoa and sea-sharks of a former
age.

One of the three Queensland Civil Service
Commissioners is Michael O’Malley, for many
years C.P.S. at Ipswich, afterwards Police
Magistrate at several towns, and Sheriff of North
Queensland. There is no truer man in the
civil service. He is a Hibernian of that good
old school which thought that “ bating a foe ” was
just as imperative a duty as “ Gating a frind. ’
O'Malley is an old colonist, and saw many a
stirring event in the early days. He is one of the
most genial of men, and laughs boisterously at a
good joke, but he can also be as stern as Rhada-
manthus, and many a bully of the old days carried
the memory of O’Malley’s right upon his lower
jaw. Here is one episode told by a man who was
present on the occasion. At that time in Ipswich
there was a police officer, built on a large scale,
and of an offensively aggressive disposition. This
local tyrant was walking along with an old lame
Irish gardener who carried a stick to assist his
progress. Suddenly, and treacherously, the officer
struck the ancient horticulturist a heavy blow on
the side of the head, knocked him do%vn, took
away his stick, and walked on to meet O’Malley
coming up in the opposite direction. “You are a
cowardly scoundrel to strike that old man ! ” said
O’Malley. “ I’ll give you a lick with this stick,”
said the bould trap—who found himself unex-
pectedly lying on his back, and the stick in the
hands of O’Malley, who belted him with great
impartiality over the entire length and breadth of
his anatomy, after which the wielder of the cudgel
walked joyfully home, at peace with all mankind.

Last week I called to see C, F. Chubb,
father of one of our best Supreme Court judges.
This genial old colonist resides in Ipswich, where
he practised as a solicitor for many years. I met
him first in 187 b, when ho was one of the leading
citizens, writer of prologues, poems, and addresses,
moving spirit in all progressive movements, and
general good fellow all round. He is the author
of that smart Laconistie prophecy concerning Mr.
Justice Real who studied for the Bar while work-
ing as a carpenter in the Ipswich railway work-
shops. Chubb said : “That man has gone from
the bench to the Bar, and will ultimately go from
the Bar to the Bench.” It was sad indeed for me
to find this old legal disciple of Democritus- the
merry sage who laughed and grew fat—confined
to the house by paralysis, with the clear
memory and sparkling vivacity partially
suspended. So pass the worthy pioneers
slowly or abruptly like vanishing figures in
the kaleidoscope of life. Instinctively I re-
called that saying of Cyrus, the son of Cambyses :
“If neither generous friends, nor the spirits of
departed heroes, were to assist in perpetuating
our fame, our very names would soon be banished
from the memories of men.”

Among some of my old papers I find a
curious memento of a visit to the Woogarno
lunatic asylum some 12 years ago. One of the
patients, a man of good family and classical
education, imagined he had been appointed
“ Imperial Inspector of Asylums,” and he conli-
dentially entrusted me with one of his despatches
for delivery to Sir Arthur Kennedy. The follow -
ing is an exact copy :
Lunatic Asylum, Woogaroo,
19th May, 1877.
To the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
Lord Carnarvon.
My Dear Lord,-—I have the honour to enclose you my
final report to the Royal Commissioners appointed to
enquire into the working of the Asylum and the Recep-
tion House, and you will perceive that instead of being a
lunatic asylum it is a Fenian Protection Asylum for me
purpose of raising up a rebellion similar in character to the
one in Canada in 1838 when Lord Durham was sent out as
I -ord High Commissioner. I attribute this solely to Sir
Maurice O’Connell, President of the Legislative Council,
and the late Colonial Secretary, Sir Arthur Macalister,
who just before resigning appointed himself Agent-
General in London. My dear intended bride, lam with
me in affectionate love to her ladyship and your dear,
darling children. J.F.G., Imperial Inspector.

About lb years ago a shepherd was found
dead in a clump of myall acacias on a station out
on the Barcoo. Beside the body was an empty
rum bottle and a pannikin, on the bottom of
which the dying man had scratched the words,
‘‘an officer of the Light Brigade.” And this was
perfectly true. He had actually been an officer in
crr-e 1^)

I met, last week, a schoolmate of Captain
Withers, who was in command of the unfortunate
Quetta. He tells me that Captain Withers’ father
was a sea captain who lost his vessel in a voyage
to Australia, sailed for England as a passenger
from Melbourne in the Royal Charter, and was
lost in the wreck of that vessel.

New nations spring up like Jonah’s cala-
bash. It seems incredible that only 44 years have
passed away since Dr. Browning, in March, 1846,
enquired in the House of Commons “ If any steps
had been taken to provide steam communication
with Australia ? ” And Cardwell in reply said
the question required grave consideration as it
“ involved serious financial difficulties!” And
now, in 1890 ! - Maroogaline.
'l'he N.S.W. Agricultural Society wants to
prefix “ Royal ”to its name. Who ever heard of
a royal agriculturist ? George 111. was called
“the farmer,” but only in jest. “When Adam
delved and Eve span, who was then the gentle-
man?” There is no congeniality between the
craft that constitutes the foundations of society
and the useless, gilded puppet that tops the social
pmnacle and is the antipodes of the farmer. The
N.S.W. Agricultural Society is moribund now ;
when it becomes “Royal ” it will be dead.
It was in Burketowu (Q.) in 1868, and the
thermometer would have stood, as usual, at 117
degrees in the shade, if there had been any shade
to stand it in ; time, 11.30 a.m. : scene, McLen.
nan’s big room, which at that time did duty a s
courthouse. The P.M., Government
&c., Mr. Landsborough, presided. The first and
only case set down for hearing was Swan v t
Thor]). No lawyers were, retained on either side,
for the good and sufficient reason that none
resided within 040 miles (happy Gulf-country !).
Captain (by courtesy) Swan deposed that he com-
manded a steamship plying to Sweer’s Island,
and carrying Government mails. (On cross-
examination he admitted said steamer was only
45 tons burthen.) Employed accused in the
capacity of cook, steward and first mate. Ac-
cused got drunk and neglected his duty, con-
sequently the whole concern had to be delayed for
one calendar day. Said the P.M., addressing
accused : “ Well, Joe, I think ye’d better go back
to work, or the ‘Pioneer’ won’t be able to get
away.’’ “But that won’t do,” quoth the gallant
Captain Swan —“ I want him punished.” “What
am I to do with him? ” mournfully enquired the
P.M., “ I have no lockup and no police.” “ Fine
him,” said the ready-witted captain. “H’m !
well, Joe, you’ll be fined a day’s pay,” quoth
Landsborough; “the court’s closed.” And as
they adjourned for refreshments, the Government
Resident, P.M., &c., said: “I wouldn’t stop it
from poor old Joe if I were you, Swan !” Joe’s
quick ears intercepted this remark, and as they
came out he accosted Swan with: “Mind! he
told you afterwards not to stop it.”
Several years ago
the members of the N.Z.
Parliament reduced their
own screws on the ground
that the country was
hard-up and required
economy. Then they
reduced the number of
legislators because there
were more of them than
were actually essential,
and they pointed out to
each other that by abol-
ishing 20 per cent, of
themselves they would
save a lot of needless
expenditure. Next they
abolished the property-
vote, though most of them
had property-votes them-
selves, and decreed that
all elections should be
held on one day, so that
a candidate who is de-
feated in one constitu-
ency has no longer a
chance to get in for
another during the same
election. And now the
country has heaved out
51 of these liberal-minded
senators in one batch,
and chosen new men in
their places, and among
the Oppositionists in par-
ticular there are only
about two prominent in-
dividuals left. The old
fossils have gone down
with a fearful and won-
derful smash, and among
the defeated men none
seem to be much regretted,
unless it may be Vincent
Pyke. Pyke’s constitu-
ents have been trying to
decide for 12 years past
whether they should pre-
sent him with a large
estate or shoot him at
•sight, but they have evi-
dently postponed the
decision too long, for he
i-> gone now, and the
chance is lost. Also Grey
has resigned, and the
harmless Stout lost cour-
age at the last moment
and kept out of the
contest, and Atkinson is
slowly dying, and Vogel
is in England losing
money over the most
idiotic and ignorant novel
published since the days
of Moses, and of the an-
cient land-marks there are
very few remaining. For
the politician is an un-
certain thing, who leads
a precarious existence,
and draws his salary at irregular intervals, and
then fades unexpectedly away, and only Parkes
endures for ever.
S. Crawford Pearson, the first discoverer
of rubies in Central Australia, died recently.
Haddon Chambers, the Australian play-
wright, whose play of the ‘ ‘ Idler ” is being pro-
duced at Prohman’s New York Lyceum, has been
stuffing the interviewers with yarns about his
forsaking the N.S. Wales Civil Service for cattle-
raising in the bush. He states that he lived in
London on Ins. a week before he struck ile with a
story published in Society, and a little play, as
yet unacted, called “ A Mere Cipher,” sold to
Prank Dietz. This success was followed by that
of “Devil’s Caresfoot,” written in conjunction
with another writer, from which, so says
Chambers, they derived little, owing to the
hands it got into. He then wrote “Captain
Swift ” for Beerbohm Tree, but found no oppor-
tunity of reading it to him until he saw him go
in-to a Turkish bath. There Chambers had him
up a tree, and reading the play, got it accepted.
Which reminds us that a certain N.S. Wales’
barrister will never read a long brief, no matter
how highly it is marked. The solicitor who would
have him thoroughly primed with the case usually
calls on him ere he rises on the morning of the
trial, at ones invades his bedroom, reads him out
of bed and into the bath, howls out instructions
above the din of the shower, continues reading
while he drosses and breakfasts, reads him into
town in a cab, and winds up by firing a summary
of the case into him at the barristers’ table. To
do the learned counsel justice, he makes few
mistakes, and always gets a verdict when one is
obtainable by artistically humbugging the jury.
A member of the Stanley gang says “Life
is very cheap in Central Africa, and girls may bo
bought in every village where we were at the rate
of four girls for a piece of 12 handkerchiefs.” Not
cheap at all. It is sufficient to throw one hand-
kerchief to the average Australian girl and she
is yours till death.
Frawncis Abigail, ’aving returned from
Hingland chock-full of “informations,” loses no
opportunity to air it with his French accent and
Bond-street duds. In a letter to Sydney Daily
Telegraph he asserts that :
“It has been reckoned that there is (sic) in London
more Jews than in Palestine, more Scotchmen than in
Aberdeen, more Welshmen than in Cardiff, more Irishmen
than in Belfast, and Germans, Italians, Frenchmen, and
others are legion. The numbers being Jews, over 30,000 ;
Scotchmen, over 50,000; Welshmen, over 30,000; Irish-
men, over 90,000,” &e.
Referring the much-travelled and damnably-
inaeeurate Abigail for information concerning the
population of Palestine to the proverbial school-
boy, let us point out to him that the population
of Cardiff is 108,570; that Belfast has 185,000
inhabitants, and that he likewise ridiculously
under-estimates the population of Aberdeen. A
little travel is a dangerous thing.
Some months ago when the puzzle-com-
petition broke out very badly in Sydney, The
Bulletin exposed the system of the “chork-
pops,” nom-de-plume, £5-gifts, gentry who chose
two simple words, transposed their initial syl-
lables, and sat down to await postage-stamps.
These being received in numbers, there the matter
ended and they recommenced the game from a
different address and under a different cognomen.
But a fresh breed has sprung up who select high-
sounding titles, deposit sums in the hands of
public persons, and brazen the matter out,
generally on the perfect rectitude “lay.” They
work the thing differently : they select a number
of letters capable of construction into various
words, and should all these be spotted, in order to
keep the money in the family they invent a new
one. Thus from the combination of letters
which legitimately form only “Pinch-gut, thing-
cup, pitch-gun, and tug-pinch,” these gentry
produce “gun-chipt,” having invented the latter
word to save the expense of “parting.” In the
hands of another guileless genius “muriatic”
becomes “citarium,” and so on. As we said
before, we have no sympathy for the credulous
owls who expect to gain £5O in return for ss. by
exercising their shallow wits in a manner befitting
the occupants of an idiot-asylum. But the crop
of fools is perennial.
A Great Triumph.
The following case has come under our observa
tion :
Miss (daughter of a prominent physi
cian who won’t allow us to publish names, because
“it would he infra dig, and unprofessional”) ha, 1
been in delicate health for the last five years.
The cause was sin-ply anaemia or poorness ol
blood, her father had treated her for all sorts ol
complaints and she had been also attended bj
several “ ladies’ ” specialists without benefit. The
case came under our notice quite accidentally
some months ago, Miss was then just
20i years of age, five feet five inches in height and
weighed exactly 101 pounds. She had the usual
symptoms of anaemia, excessively pale and pasty
skin and lips, dark circles round the eyes, soft and
flabby limbs, complete loss of periodic functions,
was excessively nervous, timid and weak, no
appetite and very restless at night. We micro
scopically examined the blood and by dilution
with distilled water, and careful examination,
arrived at a very accurate estimation of the
number of red blood corpuscles per ounce, what
there were of them appeared all shrivelled and
shrunk like dried fruit and were almost destitute
of vitalising properties. We advised the use of
Clements Tonic in doses of a dessertspoonful after
meals, and this treatment was adopted without
the father’s knowledge. Four weeks afterwards
when five small bottles of the remedy had been
taken we again examined the -blood, the red
corpuscles had increased by 70 per cent, as near as
we could estimate, and under the microscope had
the appearance of over ripe red currants almost
bursting, the patient had gained five pounds then
(September 7th, 1889) weighing seven stone eight
pounds. The appetite was much improved, the
limbs were becoming firmer and the muscular
tissue more defined and pronounced. She could
walk considerable distances without undue fatigue,
could eat and digest almost any kind of food, the
lips were pink and firm and the dark circles under
the eyes had almost disappeared. We advised a
continuance of the use of Clements Tonic and she
took a further course of four large bottles, and
then as perfect strength and vital energy was
restored, a longer treatment was not considered
necessary. She is now fully restored to health,
strong, vigorous and weighs 10 stone 3 pounds,
can do any kind of work or walk five miles with-
out fatigue, eats well, sleeps well, and has a vigor-
ous appetite. What a change from her condition
four months ago !
Now, reader, here’s a case that has baffled the
best medical and therapeutical skill for years,
which Clements Tonic has positively cured in
three months, but we are not allowed to publish
names-because it would not be orthodox. Man-
kind may suffer, hundreds of curable cases must
be neglected, scores of lives must be sacrificed,
because “it would be infra dip. and unprofes-
sional ” for a medical man to recommend or give a
testimonial to Clements Tonic because it is “a
proprietary article or patent medicine.” The
mere fact of its being a patent medicine is the
greatest protection for the public, for were it made
otherwise its therapeutical excellence would be
subordinate to the profits of its various makers;
while the manufacture is in the hands of one
maker, it is to his interest to make a genuine
article.

Australia was a mockery.
Mr. Justin M‘Carthy is leading the anti-
Parnell Party. Yet, speaking in Dublin on 20th
Nov. (before the party disruption) he said his
hearers “ might take from him the suggestion that
if Mr. Lockwood had 'been allowed to cross-
examine” (for Mrs. O’Shea) “ they would have a
very different story before them that night.”
The Tasmanian Treasurer has decided to
put hop-beer and dandelion ale on the same tax-
ation footing as malt liquors. One of two deduc-
tions logically follows. Either the Treasurer is a
shameless person who wages war against “soft”
drinks in the brewers’ interest, or else he has
found that the so-called “soft ” drinks are in reality
hard.
The real explanation of the Indian out-
breaks in America is the same as in the Maori
rebellions —breaches of faith by the whites. In
Canada the Indians are quiet, because they are
governed by people who devote their lives to it,
whereas in the States the work is done by political
carpetbaggers. The pressure Westwards leads to
continual perjuries against the poor Indians.
The old Council in W.A. consisted of
26 members, of whom 25 were rank Conservatives,
and the remaining one a Liberal. The Assembly
just elected contains no less than 18 members of
the old House (most of whom were returned with-
out opposition) and 12 new members. Thus the
Conservative element is still dominant, and is
likely to hinder useful and practical legislation.
The coal-mines of Chikeyo (Japan) are the
grimy prison-house of some 1700 of the Mikado’s
subjects who have run against some of the 429
sections of the Penal Code of 1880. The hours are
about 12 daily, and the lash is the chief incentive
to industry. Each man has to turn out 10 sou.
(3|d) worth of coal every time he enters the mine,
failing this he receives “solitary” and the lash.
This is the establishment with which patriotic
“ free labour ” Australian employers sought to open
up trade relations during the late strike.
What mighty contests arise from trivial
things ! A single pair of rabbits liberated in
Victoria have well-nigh wrecked all Australia.
Worked out as a sum in geometrical progression,
it has been calculated that in the course of only
three years the possible progeny of two rabbits
might attain the prodigious number of 13,000,000.
It is a matter of some consideration now as to
whether it wouldn’t be quicker and cheaper to
shift Australia than to shift the rabbits.
Under Parkes’ Electoral Bill an uncertifi-
cated bankrupt is to be disqualified for a seat in
the N.S.W. Assembly; but there is a crafty
proviso limiting the disqualificatiorrto people who
file their schedules after the Bill becomes law. If
by any mischance it should pass without that
proviso, there is one man in this country behind
whom the doors of political life would close for
ever. They have closed for ever several times
before, but this time it would be with a slam.
Last June two officers in the N.S.W.
Colonial Architect’s Department were suspended
in consequence of the faulty construction of cer-
tain defence-works at Bear Island, and rumour
said this business had something to do with the
Colonial Architect’s resignation also. Are we
ever likely to be favoured with the report of the
Royal Commission on this peculiar matter, Or will
it remain pigeon-holed until another accidental
fire cremates it and sundry other interesting docu-
ments now stowed away in the State archives ?

lations with Mrs. O’Shea prove his unfitness to
lead the Irish party in England, would the Sydney
Freetrade press consider it an equal disqualifica-
tion if he were on this side of the world instead
of on the other? Would his adultery alone be a
sufficient reason why he shouldn’t be the leader of
a New South Wales political party? Would it
prevent his getting the support of the D.T. if he
were called on to form a Freetrade Government ?
Answer out loud, ye hypocrites !
Victoria Railway Commissioner Speight
has graciously accepted a seven years’ re-engage-
ment in “ the hope that Parliament will pay some
respect to the arrangement made between him
and the late Government as regards increase of
salary.” Parliament—bless its honest heart!
will pay that necessary respect, and Speight will
get from Munro & Co. the rise which they howled
against when in Opposition. Meanwhile Mr.
Speight, who has, for ample or insufficient
reasons, lost the confidence of the public, is sing-
ing decidedly small.
John Haynes writes that “it is a well-
known fact that England is not overrun with
manufactures from foreign countries !” Just as
if it had not been found necessary in that fine
Freetrade country to pass a law enacting that all
goods of foreign manufacture sold in the United
Kingdom should be branded with the name of the
land from which they came. As a consequence,
nearly everything you buy in England is branded
“Made in Germany.” Even the “English”
Christmas cards one buys in Sydney are labelled
“Printed in Germany.” '

“If Mh'ams doesn’t look out he’ll find

There will, The Bulletin predicts, be a
strong reaction in favour of Dismal Jemmy

In Dublin, the other day, two Murphys
confronted one another, one from the bench and
the other from the dock, while nine jurymen of
the same name helped to find their erring relative
guilty.
The twelve good men and true who sat on
the Premier Building Association case were, with
about three exceptions, the dullest looking lot
that ever gladdened the eyes of counsel for defen-
dants.
An eminent Sydney Q.C. demanded 160
guineas and daily refreshers to defend an assault-
case at the recent Criminal Court. He did not get
it—a circumstance which gave a chance to the
junior Bar.
Mrs. O’Shea has, it is cabled, accepted
£50,000 in settlement of her claims in connection
with the well-advertised Wood estate lawsuit. The

Dr. Barnardo has the character of a sensa*
tion-monger “at home.” He used to have a way
of getting his “waifs ” up in artistic arrangements
of rags before photographing them for monthly-

The Australian teetotallers call John
B. Gough, the “great American orator.” As a
matter of fact, Gough was an Englishman, and was
in his first manhood when he went to the States.
He learned to drink as well as to orate in America.
Chief Justice Higinbotham is the second
man who has received in person the thanks

General Pratt, for having contributed a share in
the slaughter of the Maoris during the war of
1860.
One of the most effective pieces of sketchy
writing seen in the Australian press for a long
time is that column and-a-half in which “ Grains”
describes (in Melbourne Daily Telegraph) the
scene in Court at the conclusion of the Premier
Permanent trials.
The Duchess of Marlborough has had
Several judgments rendered against her in New
York on behalf of creditors in Birmingham. She
is, however, too well protected by the American
marriage settlement to square up her husband’s
debts, no matter how willing she be.
Apropos to Premier Parkes’ intervention
on behalf of the private character of the Prince of
Wales, we are reminded that on the front of the
new Government Works Office in Phillip-street,
Sydney, Tummy’s head appears in stone with the
English kingly crown on. A little previous !
Gladstone's birthday was on 29th Decem-
ber. The Bulletin prophesies that within a few
weeks, Parkes, K.C.M.G., will have published in
the Sydney daily papers a letter received by him
from Gladstone in reply to his (Parkes’) birthday-
congratulations. “Me and Mister Gladstone !”
Hon. G. B. Simpson, N.S.W. Attorney-
General, has gone to Melbourne with a view to
personally conducting the Earl of Jersey thence
to Sydney. As G.B.S. always looks like “A
Gentleman of the Reign of George IV.” he should
make a not unfavourable impression on the Tory
peer.
When J. E. Brown, the N.S. Wales
Director of Forests, was in the S.A. service, his
office was exactly opposite that of H. Y. L. Brown,
the S.A. Government Geologist. Through this,
one was called “Woody” Brown and the other
“ Stony ” ditto. The latter still retains his nick-
name.
Professor Koch, the German microbe-ex-
terminator, has a cousin in Victoria—a long,
plain, German farmer, who hoes potatoes and
takes no interest in scientific research. Another
cousin was the ex-sailor, publican, and miner,
Harry Koch, who discovered the famous Koch’s
Pioneer claim at Bendigo.
Arthur Forbes and Jack Woodyatt, two
Queensland notabilities, are exciting wonder and
awe in London “ sassiety ” just now; while W.
K. D’Arcy, the Mount Morganaire and ci-devant
Rockhampton attorney, is bidding for popularity
something after the style which has been immor-
talised by “ Nitrate King ” North.
The Pall Mall remarks that Admiral
Scott’s precedence claim is quite novel and wholly
untenable. His predecessors were perfectly
satisfied with the second place at table. The fact
that Admiral Scott is a scion of the house of the
“ bold Buccleuch,” and has wedded an Australian
beauty, can hardly be regarded as-giving him a
title to head the procession.
It is said that Mrs. (“ General ”) Booth
was the means of restoring the giddy wife of a
British Cabinet Minister to her husband’s arms.
The individual in question had prepared a petition
in divorce, with a young Prince as.co-respondent,
when Mrs. B. appeared on the scene, the petition
was withdrawn, husband and wife left for the
continent, and the young Don Juan for Gibraltar.
The Pall Mall speculates whether Mr.
Crick, of N.S.W., is a descendant of the gentle-
man of the same name, public orator of Cambridge
from 1836 to 1848, whose address, on the installa-
tion of Prince Albert, Thackeray parodied in
Punch ? The Bulletin thinks the question may
be safely answered in the negative. Mr. Crick is
so vigorous a speaker that he must surely be the
very first orator of his family.
Bishop Moorhouse, late of Australia, now
of Manchester, may succeed Dr. Thompson, Arch-
bishop of York, as Primate of England. Which
is only another proof of the fact that a man who
is big enough to be regarded by Australians as
really a big man, can hold his own with anyone in
England. If a man can impress Australia with
his ability he can go up top anywhere.
Leonard Courtney, M.P., was asked at an
English political meeting whether he was in
favour of the Bill to legalise marriage with a
deceased wife’s sister. “May I inquire,” said
Mr. Courtney, all smiles, “ whether the gentleman
who puts that question is married ?” “lam !”
“Has your wife a sister living?” “She has.”
“Is your wife present?” “No.” “Well, my
wife is present; she too has a sister living,” said
Courtney, resuming his seat.
The late Archbishop of York was con-
sidered to be too much of a thinker for the “ Can-
terbury ” billet. At the time of his appointment
he was generally spoken of as the heir-apparent to
the Primacy, but, ere long, “York” developed
ideas and earned a reputation for unorthodoxy.
So for thirty years he stood aside and saw smaller
men walk past him into the Promised Land which
lies beyond Lambeth Palace gates. The slighted
Archbishop amassed a heap of ointment, no doubt,
but there was a fly in it.
Mr. W. Clarson, the well-known, agricul-
tural writer, editor of the Mildura (N.S.W.)
Cultivator, has suicided by shooting himself in
the abdomen. Among his effects was found a
paper bearing the following words “ Quite
overwhelmed; mind gone; no hope; friendless.”
Mr. Clarson, formerly principal partner in Clar-
son, Massinaand Co., Melbourne, had lived a very
varied and stormy life; the divorce-suit in which
his wife figured is still fresh in the memory of
Victorian readers.
Thus “ Dagonet "; “Stanley is un-
doubtedly a man of great perseverance, and he
must be a man of some courage also, but he is as
little like a hero, using the word in its best and
correctest sense, as can well be imagined ; he is
a hard bargaining man of business, much more
like a bagman than a Bayard, with the keenest of
eyes for the main chance; he has about as much
to do with heroism and chivalry as the,captain of
one of Marryat’s slaving schooners, or one of the
lowest of his black-flag hoisting pirates-had to do
with Drake or Blake or Columbus or Vasco de
Gama.”

With life, but lifeless, fell at the tree’s base.”

Lady Hopetoun’s brother, Hon. F. R. W.
E. DeMoleyns, will not (says the eableman)
return to Melbourne as A.D.C. td Governor
Hopetoun. Bless you, we never thought he would !
He will be succeeded by an individual bearing the
oppressively-dignified “monniker” of Capt. the
Hon. Claud H. C. Willoughby. Willoughby is
understood to have an excellent moral character
and to be fond of staying in o’ nights.

Lady Hopetoun “continues to progress
satisfactorily,” but we don’t hear a word as to
how her brother is getting on. Satisfactorily, we
trust. Favourable accounts of Lord Hopetoun’s
health also come to hand from Government House,
Melbourne, the latest yarn stating that his lord-
ship has a habit of glancing at the vacant chair,
and then breaking forth into the glad refrain—
“ That’s when you feel all right.”

Lord Hopetoun’s two sisters, now at
Government House, Melbourne, areof the Sweden-
borgian persuasion, and for yeai’S have been
regular and devout attendants at the New Jeru-
salem Church at Netting Hill Gate, London.
They are very amiable, but somewhat “slow.”
However, they will be a decided improvement
upon Lady Hopetoun, who. is noted for her per-
sonal dislike of the colonies—writes a London
correspondent.

Sydney Truth simply deceives itself in
trying to palm-off part of one of Robert Brough’s

Lord’s Prayer and publish it as original prose.

And a word in the ear of the other Sydney
Sunday paper, tire Times, which, inexorable in
its virtue, prescribes the lash as the only effective
deterrent for assaults on youthful purity. Which
is the worse, let us ask, to debauch a single indi-
vidual, or to pander to the salacity of all the dirty-
minded little gamblers and prurient servant-
girls of a whole country by means of a dirty
publication issued from your office ? The
Bulletin has not a weak stomach. It could eat
its dinner at a post-mortem in a morgue, but its
gorge revolts at such transparent cant as th°t of
the Sunday Times avenger of virtue.

The Si nday Times, in horror, holds on high a grimy paw
And shouts: “ The larrikin must feel the rigour of the

la the (London) Hawk of 18th Nov. last
appears a four-column article entitled “The
Avenger of Virtue,” in which the bull’s-eye is
partly turned on to the wanton and cruel massacre
following on a certain historical performance farci-
cally known as the Mount Rennie trial.

According to the Victorian gaol regula-
tions Mirams’ big beard, the now grey beard
which the little man has worn for so many years,
will have to be shaved. To the average man, who
has not a conspicuously large beard, nor a particu-
larly luxuriant crop of hair, gaol-shaving and
cropping involve no particular indignity, especially
as the hair and beard are allowed to grow for
three months before the expiry of the sentence.
But a beard such as Mirams’ does not grow in a
year, and it will be cruelly extending the little
man’s punishment should he be treated in the
same fashion as a short-bearded man. A man’s
sufferings should, so far as possible, be allowed to
expire with his sentence, and this can never be the
case where release from prison is attended by a
marked change in personal appearance. This plea
is offered on behalf, not alone of well-known and
comparatively influential men like Mirams, but
also for all obscure long-bearded men who may be
so unhappy as to come within the grasp of a law
which should, while no respecter of persons, be hi
all things humane.
* # #
It was with sadly unconscious humour that
Mirams, in pleading for a lenient sentence,
said “he might speak of the cruel length of the
prosecution.” Perhaps the poor, broken-down
little man had really forgotten for the moment
how a horde of counsel for the defence talked
against time in Melbourne City Court.
* * *
They have a regulation at Melbourne
Lying-in Hospital, which draws a distinction
between the married women and the unmarried,
the latter of whom are not allowed to see their
friends. Who are the tabbies that they should
take the functions of punishment into their own
hands ? —these luxurious tabbies, not one of whom
has ever to complain, as did Madame Roland, that
the wants of her nature were unsatisfied. The
unmarried mothers are only friendless because
they are moneyless : the most skilful doctors, the
best nurses, the most expensive delicacies, are
equally at the service of the rich married woman,
and of the unmarried mother who has money of her
own, or has a rich protector. It is not wickedness
which is disgraceful, only helplessness and poverty.
How fashionably feminine —to bite and scratch
and kick your sister and pull her hair out when
she has fallen ! The love which has placed the
servant-girl at the mercy of a lot of fashionable
dames, is often more holy than the business com-
pact which has sold a “respectable” woman to
her rich husband.

Several things occur to us in re Sydney
Echo’s prize yachting-song. Firstly, its senti-
ments are far too “ unobjectionable ” to suit the
calf-and-breastbone brigade ; secondly, not being
set to music it ain’t a song at all; thirdly, that it
ain’t suitable for setting to music; fourth, and
lastly, that nobody would ling it if it were—
except, perhaps, the people who don’t go down to
the sea in yachts. However, it might suit James
Fairfax, the Herald’s glum proprietor, who has
or used to have a yacht. He didn’t like the sea
over-much, for on the rare occasions upon which
the Magic left the Beautiful Harbour for Southern
waters, “ Mister James ” used go down to meet it
in the train.

A well-ku >wn Sydney journalist was, in
California the other day, living at an hotel in a
■“prohibitionist” town. On the first evening of
his residence at the caravanserai, shortly before
nine o’clock the waiter came to the room where
the scribe sat smoking with a friend and ex-
claimed; “Gentlemen, I am now going to the drug-
store.” “Well,” said the journalist, thinking this
communication most irrelevant and uninterest-
ing, “suppose you are going to the drug-store,
we havn’t got anything to do with that, have
we?” “That, gentlemen,” replied the waiter,
“is what I have come to ascertain. You see,
this hotel has a standing prescription, and I can
get you whatever you want. I was just going
down to get half-a-pint of whisky for an upstairs
guest and thought you might require some.”
And when it was put that way our friend, the
journalist, thought that he did want the standing
prescription of the hotel dispensed on his behalf.

The average reporter seldom tells the
truth except by accident, and not often even then.
Eor instance, when Mrs. Pearcey, the murderess,
appeared before the court, the London papers went
into details as follows :
Daily News.—She is a slightly-built woman of medium
height.
Standard.—She is a powerfully-built young woman much
above the ordinary stature.
Daily News.—Her hat, which had faded-blue trimmings
in it, &o. She also wore a cape trimmed with crape.
Standard.—The prisoner wore a green straw hat trimmed
with dark-green ribbons, and a short dolman of
grenadine.
Daily Telegraph.—She had on a black hat trimmed with
dark-green ribbon, and adark ulsterof rough cloth.
Echo.—Dressed in a hat of dark-green shade.
Daily Chronicle.—On her head was a black hat.
Star.—She wore a big, black cloak.

There is a certain eloquent pathos about
the new chum at times. The other day the
wreckage of an imported British dude—an indi-
vidual with haggard boots, and a coat that seemed
to have been habitually walked over by frogs and
snails, and an eyeglass, and a general aspect like
that of a duke who slept in a haystack—dropped
into a Dunedin hotel and ordered a drink. But
the publican looked at him with a relentless eye,
and asked in a cold, hard tone if he had got the
sixpence, and when he explained that he had
unfortunately left his cheque-book at home, on top
of the grand piano, and that his last £lOO note
was in his other pants along with the Koh-i-noor,
and consequently he couldn’t pay till he received
his remittance, the drink-merchant said briefly
“Go !” Then a bright idea seemed to flicker over
the new chum’s dreary face. “ Suppose,” he said,
in a broken voice, “I were to—haw —deposit my
eye-glass with you as seeuwity until my wemittance
awwives.” N.B. —He got the drink.

Dear Bulletin,— Re your meritorious
crusade against the belltopper-hat, have you not
noticed that the greatest supporters of this old
British abomination are the Americans? Walk
down Wall-street or Broadway in July, when
sunstroke is a power in the land, and you find a
sea of “nailcans.” Again, note the Yankee in Aus-
tralia (generally representing prison-made doors,
canned fruits and fish that we ought to be flogged
for importing when we have the raw material rot-
ting at our doors), and you find him with a highly-
spiced Down East accent and a still more pro-
nounced narrow-brim shiny stove-pipe tile ! N.B.
—The above is the result of an American who lost
a Lincoln and Bennett to me over Carbine having
lately made himself scarce.—Yours, H.Y.A.

A well-known -.writer recently sent in a
simple story about two sisters to a certain Sydney
weekly journal on approval. Two weeks later he
and found its beauties unexplored. He then called
asked the manuscript back, and, heading it the
“Salacious Sisters,” again sent it in. He called
back inside three days and found the counter-clerk
devouring it and ascertained that it had been read
by nearly everyone in the building from editor to
proof-reader. But they didn’t accept the yarn,
and it was returned with the remark that it did
not sustain the interest excited by the title.

“An Australian” writes to a Loudon
paper to express his astonishment at the strange
apathy of the spiritless people of Britain towards
the indolence of the classes. Thus, he points out
that, while the carriages of the rich are allowed to
monopolise the roadways in Hyde Park, the
vehicles of the poor and the cabs of the middle-
class are rigorously excluded. And this, too, even
when Society, so-called—that is, the sweating
classes- are absent from the metropolis.

Some years ago, one of the Victorian
Supreme Court judges condemned in severe terms
those dudes who patronised the dress-circles of
the Melbourne theatres on vice-regal nights, “in

leading off the last Cup festivities at Melbourne
Government House.

At Port Darwin the other day, Ah Ng, a
Chinaman, got married to a young girl of his own
nationality. After the marriage he didn’t speak
a word to his bride, but got up at four o'clock in
the morning, and said he was going fora walk.
Shortly afterwards his body was found floating in
the harbour. The local Celestial idea is that a
devil ran away with him.

There is a material reason for everything
under Heaven. It is cabled from Maoriland that

that he murdered his wife because he loved her
BANNERMAN OF DANDENONG.
I rode through the bush in the burning noon,
Over the hills to ra’y bride ;
The track was rough and the way was long,
And Bannerman, of Dandenong,
He rode along by my side.
A day’s march off my beautiful dwelt,
By the Murray streams in the west .
Lightly lilting a gay love-song,
Rode Bannerman of the Dandenong
With a blood-red rose on his breast
“ Red, red rose of the western streams,*
Was the song he sang that day—
Truest comrade in hour of need —
Bay Mathinna his peerless steed—
I had my own good gray.
There fell a spark on the upland grass,
The dry bush leapt into flame ;
And 1 felt my heart go cold as death,
And Bannerman smiled and caught Ills breath,
But 1 heard him name her name.
Down the hillside the fire-flood rushed,
On the roaring eastern wind ;
Neck and neck was the reckless race—
Ever the bay mare kept her pace,
But the gray horse dropped behind.
He turned in the saddle—“ Let’s change, I say !”
And his bridle-rein he drew,
He sprang to the ground— “ Look sharp !” he said,
With a backward toss of his curly head,
“I ride lighter than you !”
Down and up—it was quickly done—
No words to waste that day ! —
Swift as a swallow she sped along,
The good hay mare from the Dandenong—
And Bannerman rode the gray.
The hot air scorched like a furnace blast
Prom the very mouth of hell—
The blue-gums caught and blazed on high
LHce flaming pillars into the sky ;
The gray horse staggered and fell.
“For your life 1” he cried—“ for her dear sake, ride?
Into the gulf of flame
Were swept, in less than a breathing space,
The laughing eyes, and the comely face,
And the lips that named her name.
She bore me bravely, the good bay mare—
Stunned and dizzy and blind,
I heard the sound of a mingling roar,
’Twas the Lachlan river that rushed before,
And the flames that rolled behind.
Safe, safe, at Waranga gate,
I fell, and lay like a stone.
O love ! thine arms were about me then,
Thy warm tears called me to life again,
But, O Ood ! that I came alone !
■We dwell in peace, my beautiful one
And I, by the streams in the West,
But oft through the mist of my dreams along
Rides Bannerman of the Dandenong,
With the blood-red rose on his breast.

too deeply, without his love being returned; she
had long declined to cohabit with him. “The
cause of lire crime,” continues the cablegram, “is
believed to have been jealousy. Gallagher re-
cently came into possession of a legacy of £3000.
A family of four, two girls and two boys, are left
orphans. The body of Mrs. Gallagher was found
with one of the children clinging to it, and covered
with blood.” The present writer remembers that
some years ago there was great scandal in a N.Z.
town. A young woman —Mrs. Gallagher afore-
said —who had married a man who had recently
•succeeded to a little fortune, was living at a R.C.
presbytery, whereat resided two priests. Gallagher
entered the place and claimed his wife, who refused
to go with him. A fight ensued, and one or both
of the two priests fell on Gallagher, beating him
terribly. The case came before the B.M. Court,
but was finally withdrawn “ to prevent scandal to
religion.” And now Mrs. Gallagher’s little child
tugs in vain at the blood-bedabbled dress of its
dead mother. Emile Zola understands this sort
of thing.

In the new Sydney lock-up the old and
barbaric system of crowding a lot of more or less
sober prisoners into one small, dark, noisome cell,
is to be abolished. The new cells are to be
brightly lit, and the occupants are at all times to
be visible to the officer in charge through doors
consisting of open steel bar-work. The brutal in-
difference which has characterised the N.S.W.
authorities in such matters may be judged from
the fact that when a man is sentenced to death he
is placed in a lighted cell from the outside of which
his every movement is visible; whereas when a
man who has been picked up unconscious in the
street smelling of drink, and who may, for all
that the police know, be suffering either from
mere alcoholism or from an obscure skull-fracture,
is simply pitched into a dungeon. The outcome
of this hideous system is shewn in the ghastly
cases of Hewett and his victim and in those of
many other poor wretches whose blood rests on
the head of the authorities.

The Sydney bank-manager who disap-
peared the other day leaving some of his clothes
and a pistol loaded in four chambers beside them
on the beach, also an alleged deficiency of £4000
in his accounts, appears to have made a bold
and sc’entific dash for freedom, inasmuch as he
departed by ’Frisco mail-steamer just as the
Christmas holidays commenced, and the mail had
got past New Zealand (the last point at which lie
could be arrested on an extradition-warrant ere
reaching Honolulu, where there is no extradition)
before the bank people discovered, on the
resumption of business, that he had departed. He
will find at Honolulu many congenial souls. So
far as Australia is concerned, the dominions of
King Kalakana form the only defaulters’ refuge
left on earth. When the steamer calls there more
than one Australian on whose head a price is set
always goes aboard to have a drink and see if he
knows any of the passengers. As we last steamed
away from Honolulu the chief accountant of a
Sydney bank, with whom we had been sauntering
round, pointed with his thumb at an important-
looking potentate in a very elaborate white suit:
“That’s one of our fellows,” he said. “He
shook £4650 from us six years ago, got away with
it, and is settled here now—married to a woman
with money,” On the same occasion we got a
glimpse of a cheerful Tasmanian well-known in
Sydney in the days of “Olivette ” and “ Tambour
Major.” He had skipped—with a palty £1000 or
so. After residing in Honolulu for some years he
obtained a splendid appointment—confidential
secretary to one of the fifteen richest men in the
States—and he holds that appointment now.

Dear Bulletin, —The usual bank-manager
went a-missing last week in Sydney, and the old,
familiarshortage turned up in the accounts, and the
customary clothes were found by the edge of the
ocean to show that he had gone in to wash him-
self from sanitary motives, and not in any way
owing to the fact that the cash had gone wrong
and had got drowned by accident. Also, a
revolver, with one barrel discharged, was placed
along with the clothes, to demonstrate that ho
had blown his brains out first, so that if he got
drowned his sufferings might be cut short, or else
it was intended to prove that he had committed
suicide in a naked condition on the shore and
some one had stolen the body, or possibly be
meant to imply that he had shot himself
at sea and bad then swum out and de-
posited the pistol on the shore and after-
wards drowned his dead remains, or else he
habitually shot himself before washing—the
theories were all the same price and the public
could take its choice. The first,impression of the
police was that a man who was both shot and
drowned must be very dead indeed, and they
looked round anxiously to find out if he had
hanged himself in addition to his other misfor-
tunes, and then pounded himself to death against
a wall and taken poison ; their next idea was that
he was probably too dead altogether, and they
rushed off to look at the list of passengers By the
San Francisco steamer. The suit of clothes
which is found by the.sea shore, with a tearful
farewell in the pocket, is about played out, and
when the cash won’t square it is advisable to hunt
up some fresher expedient. Some very good
results used to be arrived at by hiring a man to
come in at night, and tie up the manager, and
burgle the safe, and the innocent policeman of the
early days generally took it for granted that the
deficiency was entirely owing to this midnight
marauder, but 40 years of hard service wore tliis
dodge to pieces. Then another enterprising race
of officials arose, who simply set the bank on fire
when things wouldn’t balance, but the modern
bank isn’t combustible enough, and besides the
fire brigade always comes along in time to save

the cash-book and the ledger and all the shortage,
and even this scheme is practically extinct. In
fact, when things are hopelessly wrong there is
no resource left except for the manager to become
insane and hide himself in an asylum, unless,
indeed, he blows up the books and the cash with
dynamite, and leaves nothing for the auditor but
a few singed scraps floating about loosely in seven
adjacent townships. The bank swindle is getting

A blushing young creature went into a
Brisbane chemist’s shop and stated that' she
hungered after a tooth-brush. The shop was
crowded, so the suave young man behind the
counter indicated a box with about two dozen
brushes in it. Then there was a long interval
which was broken at last by a fresh young voice
that stated ; “ Oh, I’ve tried them all, please, and
I like this one the best. How much is it ?” And
she was quite surprised to see how mad the suave
young man became, and how another woman, who
also wanted a toothbrush, backed out saying that
she would call again in about 18 months.

A German sailor, who deserted from his
ship years ago and settled down and married an
Australian who has given him a family, hears
that proceedings are being taken for his arrest
and conveyance to Germany, and asks The Bul-
letin for advice ;
Please be kind enough as t-o inform me in your next
issue if I run any danger of being arrested and taken
back on board ship. I am now a married man with a
family and live happily in this glorious country, and it
would be a death-blow for myself and my wife and family
should any attempt bo made to put me back to that bar-
baric state of existence the very idea of which makes me
tremble. It is an unpardonable negligence upon my part
that I did not naturalise myself up till now, but which I
shall remedy by doing as soon as possible, if not too late.
I beg of you to be kind enough to give me, as soon as
possible, explicit information as to my very critical
position.
Our correspondent can, we believe, be arrested,
torn away from our countrywoman whom he has
married and his children, and removed to a Ger-
man fortress or hulk for half-a-dozen years.
Occasionally a British seaman deserts and marries;
his arrest means a reward to the police, and once
he is handed over to the Naval authorities he is
taken away from his home and conveyed to Eng-
land, his wife and children being left here to
starve. To their disgrace the Australian authori-
ties calmly submit to this kind of thing. Two
British deserters were the other day captured in
Maoriland and sent to England, their wives and
families being left behind to scratch out an exist-
ence as best they could. The German citizen who
now writes us will undertake considerable risk in
giving the required public notice of his intention
to be naturalised, as he will thereby bring his
name under the notice of the German authorities.

Probably one of the first cases to be tried
when the new N.S.W. Divorce Bill becomes law
will come from Queanbeyan. An ill-treated wife
will be the petitioner, her cause of complaint being
that on hot nights her husband deserts his lawful
couch and scoots off to the hay-loft, over the
stables, where it is nice and cool to sleep, and that
about 2 a.m., when the cold sets in, he comes back
to her side with his pyjamas full of hayseeds. It
is not so much his sleeping in the hay-loft she
objects to as the hayseeds. And she might have
tolerated them, but when she complained gently
about the annoyance the brute told her to “go
and leave her measure for a galvanised-iron night-
dress.”

Haldane, Q.C., intends to introduce a Bill
next session to equalise the position of husbands
and waves when parties in the British Divorce
Court. A wife desiring a dissolution of marriage
now has to prove two offences, one of which—
cruelty—in some very gross cases cannot be
proved, while the husband has only to establish
one conjugal offence. One thing is, however,
clear : a woman knows for certain when she is the
mother of a particular child, but her husband
doesn’t know for certain w'hen he is the father
thereof, and upon this fact, which seriously affects
questions of succession, is based the present
custom of making adultery on the man’s part
only insufficient grounds for divorce.

Busts were out a while ago and hips in,

A poetess named Miss Ham—not Ham-
mond Eggs, but only Miss Ham—publishes a
hundredweight of verse in the Christmas number
of the Queenslander, which is evidently in-
tended to appeal to the female love for the alleged
lancer and the policeman, and the mounted
hussar when he has got all his clothes on. It
starts thus :
She was a hero’s child, her father had fallen at Tel-el-
Kebir ;
And only a hero, she said, should ever be loved by her.
That is all the evidence. Possibly the old man
was walked upon by an ammunition-mule in the
rear, or was scared to death among the commis-
sariat, and it is likely that Tel-el-Kebir was the
last place on earth that he wanted to be in, and he
was only there because he couldn’t help himself;
and m any case he didn’t fall voluntarily, and to
be shot involuntarily with a gun at Tel-el-Kebir is
much the same as being shot involuntarily with a
brick in Woolloomooloo, but he was a hero all the
same. And when the Australian girl reads this
heartrending l bosh she sheds a sorrowful tear, and
forgets that her grandfather was boomeranged by
an aborigine, which amounts to just the same
thing, barring the horse and the banner and the
yelling and the big, vociferous drum.

The Austral Salon held a discussion on
“Humour” one evening recently, and in the
course of the proceedings the chaplain of the
French warship offered a few remarks in his own
language. It would have been $ll right only the
Salon took it for granted that he was talking about
humour, and laughed till it lost its voice and dis-
lodged all its back hair, and as the reverend
gentleman was merely thanking his friends for a
very enjoyable evening it was presently felt that a
hitch had arisen somewhere. When he had
finished there was an embarrassing pause. Some
of the members said “ Oui ” in an uncertain sort
of way, and some of them groped in the dim
recesses of their memories for some disjointed
scrap of the French they had learnt at school
and said: “ Avez-vous Ic can if demon ancle ?”
The kindly Frenchman felt in his pockets and
replied that he hadn’t got it about him, and then
the Salon got into a perfect agony of perplexity,
and, fixing its harassed eye upon the visitor, it
exclaimed: “ Polly-vans Frongsay .” It is im-
possible to guess what might have happened after
that, but luckily a male friend came to the rescue
and cried out; “A r ux vomica! Nil dcsperanduni!
Nihil fit! Casus belli! Fiat justitia mat caelum;
similia similibus curantur /” and these timely
quotations tided over the difficulty. The Salon
is now of opinion that it is rather backward with
its Hebrew, but otherwise its education is all
there.

Wolfe’s Schnapps—lt is grand.
A Townsville clerk, compelled to do lump-
ing-work under pain of dismissal, gave his earn-
ings to the Union.
Wolfe’s Schnapps has no rival.
Neil M‘Neii, one of the “ Hopeful ”
prisoners, died at Townsville the other day of
heat-apoplexy. Gaol and leg irons couldn’t effect
what freedom and bad grog speedily accomplished.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—a mild stimulant.
“The Earl of Euston is in a precarious
state of health,” says the cable. This is tele-
graphed out, probably, from the same motive that
prompts the cabling of the arrest of “Jack the
Ripper. ”
Buy Wolfe’s Schnapps by the bottle.
It is cabled from New York that the new
Assurance written by the Equitable Co., of the
U.S. in 1890, amounted to over £40,000,000 sterling
(the largest new business any Life Co. has ever
written in a single year), and that the assets
amount to over £24,000,000.
If asked to drink, call for Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Wherever Governor Hopetoun goes either
he or his suite) comes to grief. At his last cattle-
show experience the aide-de-kong resolved to be
affable to the degraded inhabitants, so he ap-
proached a wild-looking bush-gentleman and said ;
“ Haw, my deah friend, can you oblige me with r
match.” “You can have fifty flaming matches,
you gory beggar, and welcome,’’responded the son
of the soil cheerfully, and then while the high-
born person was staggering under this remark he
asked him to have a drink in such a blast of
friendly profanity that the officer dropped his cigar
and escaped.
A good bed companion—Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Guinness has been raised to the British
Beerage:—
Guinness, Alsopp. Bass, and Meux
Hobnob with the lords and dukes;
’Tis the custom to exalt
Men of hops and yeast and malt.
Why not (which would be a crusher}
Make an earl of Andrew Usher,
Or (as will be done perhaps)
Alter Wolff to Baron Schnapps ?
Advise your friends to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
The world has not yet heard the whole
truth about the Parnell-O’Shea divorce-case, and
there are very likely other reasons for Parnell’s
silence besides his guilt. In the past, there has
been no contemporary politician who maintained
over his tongue so complete a mastery as that
preserved by the Irish leader, whose memorable
silence in the House of Commons on the evening
after the Phoenix Park murders, when Chief
Secretary Forster fiercely denounced him as a
murderer, and challenged him to speak, alike
angered and astonished the British nation.
[f out’of sorts try Wolfe’s Schnapps.
“Nothing is more pitiable,” writes a well-
informed correspondent to The Bulletin, “than
the aspect of the Labour Party in England. They
have been kicked under the table by the classes
who are still kicking them, while they themselves
are gorging, and the poor devils underneath are
for tearing one another’s throats out! Hyndraan
and the Social Democrats, after a stormy rupture
with Burns and the Moderates, are playing a lone
hand, while the old organised Trades’ Unionists
are trying to down Burns and the other ‘ agita-
tors,’ Hyndman and his friends have been
charged again and again with being in Tory pay
to split the progressive vote, and there seems
something in the charge. Meantime, Capital is
organising with astonishing rapidity, and strike
after strike is failing.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps—for the liver and kidneys.

are made with pure bristles-—not wires, which
injure the scalp and cause baldness and irritation.

Does anyone remember having heard of one
Henry Searle, who field the sculling championship of the
world sortie time ag<j? He has been dead just one year,
and is apparently as fully forgotten as if he had'beon
drowned with Pharoah’s hosts in the Red Sea. And, by
the way, what has become of * the money subscribed for
the once miioh-talked-of memorial monument on the
hank of -the, Parramatta River? Searle, senr., is very
lucky, indeed, tjiat it was not erected and the bill sent
alpng to him for settlement.

The great feature of the match N.S.W. v.
S. Australia w'as Alec. Bannerman’s barracking, which
created considerable amusement, especially as the little
man was accompanied by one of the best-looking damsels
in the sacred city. As for the cricket, Iredale and Blin-
nian showed the best batting form, Iredale being; voted to
be the coming cricketer. Ferris and Giffen bowled mag-
nificently, the latter with hard luck. The New South
Welshmen were great favourites over in Adelaide, and
enjoyed themselves immensely.
* * *
The “ Gladstone appeal ” case will give the
V.R.C. committee an opportunity to disentangle a couple
of stupidly-intertwisted racing rules. Rule 42 orders the
age of a horse to be stated at time of entry, whilst Rule
45 relieves owners of the necessity of giving a horse’s age
after the quadruped has once appeared on the Fleming-
ton course under a full and proper description. The
horse’s age is then supposed to be a matter of history in
all racing-club offices, and the clerk duly inserts it in the
entry, even if the nominator omits to supply it. Glad-
stone, a five-year-old brother to Sedition, was entered
for a race at Moonee \ alley without any age being
stated at the time. Mr. Cox’s clerk, in a careless moment,
put “aged” against the name of the horse, who, being
similarly described on the card, won the race. An objec-
tion \vas lodged, and the Moonee Valley stewards dis-
qualified Gladstone on Rule 42, and dead against Rule 45.
Naturally, an appeal has been made to the V.R.C.
almighties, who must inevitably reverse the former
decision. The latter Rule modifies the former, just as one
short codicil may nullify all the conditions of a thunder-
ing long last will and testament. The Bulletin ’3 a
whale for legal complications.
* * *
Under an Australian sun many things—fruit,
vegetables, men and women for instance—ripen over
quickly. It is not so, invariably, with scullers. Searle
and Matterson ripened early, but Beach, Kemp, M‘Lean,
like some_ of their predecessors, bloomed late. It now
seems evident, as was announced at the time, that
M'Lean should have defeated Kemp (The Bulletin tipped
him) the first time they met. Says Dan Mayne: “ When
lie was defeated by Kemp some time back he (M'Lean)
was not in anything like trim ; his trousers were all
patched behind, and his boots wanted soloing and heeling
besides, he used to hoard at sixpenny restaurants, at
some of which all the good has been cooked out of the
meat at large hotels before the hoarding-house pro-
prietors purchase it for their customers. Since being
taken in hand by the Spencers, Mac has been provided
with good clothes, boots, and bed, and well fed on fat
pork, taters and pudden.” Which, Daniel, is all tommy-
rot-. Mac. had been up the river for months living
high, and was just as well cared for, if not so well
boated, as now. The reason was a mental, not a physical
one. J

Starter Hagerty, at Moorefield, is not an un-
qualified success. He waits his grey steed backwards and
forwards in front of the field until afl the horses are toeiiv
the chalk-line and then drops the flag. As a rule he is
immediately in front of one of the horses, who has to go
round him, thereby losing all chance of a good start.

A writer attributes the higher price given for
Mons Meg to the fact that the Musket blood is helm--
appreciated in England. As a matter of fact, the filly was
purchased by an Australian (Dan. Cooper), thomrii it was
the bidding of Britishers that made him pay so death Bu-
ms prize. By the way, Mons Meg, or “ Muckle Mou’d
Meg,” is the name of an ancient piece of ordnance one
of the “lions” of Edinburgh Castle.

The latest newspaper stupidity of yelling out
100 to 1 on an indifferent fighter simply because he
sprouted from the writer’s particular dumdiill received a
severe set-hack on New Year’s Eve at the Australian
Athletic Club (Sydney), when Mr. George Seale actinias
referee, humanely stopped the Baing-Suliivan fight and
awarded it to the Maorilander, who was fresh as paint,
while his foe was, dazed, weak, and despondent. They
fought 43 rounds in three hours, and were just dolin'- the
“ here’s a ban’, my trusty frien’, and gies a ban’ o’ thine ’
when the clocks struck twelve ; but, as a matter of fact*
had not Laing been over-careful the fight should have
been finished any time after the fifth round The
stranger is a well-proportioned half-caste Maori whose solo
physical weakness, apparently, is the shortness of his
arms. He fights in the crouching panther style with his
legs well spread out, his head on one side and a curious
smile on his face. Bring is wonderfully smart for a heavy
man (he scales 12st. 71b.) with both head and feet His
favourite dart was to punch Sullivan on the mark or in
the ribs with his left, and then shoot the right for the
point of the jaw, invariably drawing off then no matter
what eventuated. He got home so often that it seemed
wonderful that the Barrier pet’s head was not jerked off
hut he should have finished the business in the
fifth round, when Sullivan, silly and stupefied
from a couple of jaw-breakers, was at his mercy
The Maorilander, however, for once got Hurried
and let the show go by, hut Sullivan never had
the slightest chance afterwards. The Barrier man stands
about six inches higher than his opponent, hut is very
lathy and weighs about ten pounds less. During the
fight he did not get m r e than three blows of conseiWcncc
home, and seems to have been cured of his rushing pro-
pensities by the slogging administered Ivy Jem Hall tu-
be never attempted to fight, and simply stood up to he
belted. How he heat Hali ls a mystery. If the rumours
concerning the affair are incorrect, then the latter must
have gone weak with thumping Sullivan’s cast-iron mu ■■
The kilter may be a game man, but his reputation as'a
fighter, a newspaper-made one, is now completely dis-
pelled

At Moorefield on Saturday, Southerly Buster

The Sydney and Belvidere Clubs met on the
Association Ground on Saturday, when the Belvidere
bowling could not make any headway against the Sydney
bats, who lost four wickets during‘the afternoon" for a
■score of 336. M’Kenzie made 120, and Sid Gregory stands
notout with !).!. 3ho Belvidei-es sadly- missed the
absent Ferris.
i hat sterling mare, Yespasia, had terribly bad
luck in running second for two such stakes as the Summer
and TattersalJ’s Cups. ; Mr. Rouse deserved better luck
for the great condition he had the mare in and the
straight way in which he always runs.
## ' *
Upon the Summer Cup running it would not
seem that “ touting” is of much value. Mr. Rouse, the
owner of Vespasia, said that it he had been asked
to ngme a horse which had no show of winning
he should, on the work done on the training-track,
have named the winner. Stockwell won easily, and his
people did not think he'had a ghost of a show, but when
they fancied him for the Carrington Stakes he finished
about 60 yards behind the field, and Brickey Colleys who
had the mount, declares him the worst horse he ever
crossed. All the trainers swore by Venapa, and declared
that with a fair nin she would distance the field, hut
although she was one of the first to leave the post and led
into the straight, Too Soon wore her down and won com-
fortably.

Lady Lovel did the hat-trick at Rand wick.
She started in three Selling races and won them a)l.

Joe Burton had Muriel, the winner of Tatt.’s
Cup, iir great form, and the wonder is she did not run
better in the Summer Cup. He was very confident,
however, about her winning the two-miles race, and he
said at the scales that the only horse he was afraid of was
Lancer.
V?
Melos has proved one of the most expensive public
horses ever foaled in Australia. Times out of number he
has been hacked for thousands, started first favourite,
and gone down. He ran very badly in the Summer and
Tattersall’s Cups, and if the stable fancied his chance it
does not say much for their judgment.
* # *
“Pendragon” asserts that glove fights are far
more brutal and dangerous than many mills in the old
style. This merely bears out an opinion lengthily ex-
pressed in Tub Bulletin over twelve months ago. Our
reasons for this conclusion were simply these : The gloves
increase the reach and punishing power. Protected by
them, the fist holds good much longer and does not
readily become useless from sprained knuckles, &o. The
naked hand produces a cut when strongly used, the glove
a bruise, and the latter is the worse. In the ring days a
man could slip down and end a round. Now he must
face his opponent, for the lOsecs. afford no relief. In the
old days he fell on grass. Under Queensberry rules he
goes down on hard boards.
* * *
The Breeder and Sportsman asserts that a
certain Australian has been busy buy ing trotting horses
for the Sydney market, which he is desirous of smuggling
over on the quiet or, if possible, without a true list
of performances.

“Seppy ” Stephen, who had charge of J. White’s
horses in England, says that £2OO, at the outside, would
cover the stable losses over these unfortunate noddies.
He says, amongst a variety of other things, that Dan.
Cooper doesn’t bet.

The Bulletin is not sorry at the determination
of the Sydney magistrates to put down the totalisator,
which is now being run in all sorts of places by all sorts
of people to such an extent that in some streets every
third shop is a tote in full blast. Women patronize the
machine extensively. They are born gamblers. But isn’t
the totalisator being put down in the bookmakers’
interest ?

George Ruwald, who beat J. M'Crae and A. P.
Sharland in a sculling race for a trophy over the champion
course, is an of the N.S.W. Postal department,

He rowed the mile in 6min 30sec. and the course in 23min.

1 'Alick Bannerman sticks in a whole innings, to
be sure, but what becomes of cricket, as a game, apart
from a business? Murdoch learnt this pottering from
Bannerman, and what enjoyment was it to see the pair of
them a whole afternoon slowly scoring at the wickets, or
perhaps Bannerman scoring about three singles per hour?
Why, this guiver is death to cricket, the life-blood of
which is afforded by hitters of the stamp of Massey,
Bonnor and Charley Bannerman. In short, people won’t
pay for Mr. Potter as a bat.

The dull monotony of a “mugs”-’ billiard-match,
at a certain Brisbane hotel, was suddenly enlivened by

Jem Hall, who lately married a Melbourne girl
(Miss Rose Thompson), was to have sailed for America in
the Monowai ; but, for the second time, he was dis-
appointed. An old flame started some very rough legal
proceedings, but made no appearance in court, and so
Hail was discharged. He turned up at the Australian
Athletic Club the other evening to second Sullivan,
attired in a bell-topper and frock-coat, looking as though
he’d been to America and come back a colonel, instead o*
only across the gangway. He goes by next boat.

The system of shoeing horses with cow-hide, in-
troduced about the time of the first great exhibition in
London, is again coming into vogue in Europe. This shoe
is much lighter than the iron one, lasts longer, requires
no caulks, never slips on polished pavements, and, it is
said, preserves hoofs from splitting.

Boxing-day, in the Nursery Handicap, Pie Crust won,
running the five furlongs in 1.2 J, but on the next day she
ran almost last in the Lady Carington Prize, won in 1.4.

Punters who laid odds on Pie Crust for the
Nursery Handicap on Boxing-day had a narrow squeak.
Eloquence had the race won at the distance, but, jumping
over a piece of newspaper, went out of her stride, and
Hales, riding a desperate race, got past in the last few
strides.

The intercolonial cricket premiership is still in
abeyance. First N.S. Wales beat S. Australia by six
wickets; then Victoria beat N.S.W. by 36 runs; then
S. Australia beat Victoria by an innings and 62 runs. On
paper, S. Australia has somewhat the best of it, however.
Her glorious victory over Victoria was chiefly due to 237
of Geo, Giffen, 53 of J. J. Lyons, 50 by H. Blinmann, and
49 by J. Noel.

The Sydney Ladies’ cricket match seems to
have been chiefly remarkable for the fact that not one
ball in twenty would have hit the wickets had there been
no obstacles in its path. It was therefore not very
remarkable that the Misses Deane and Gregory, both of
cricketing families, should run their scores into three
figures.

The Bulletin congratulates the trustees of the
N.S.W. National Park on having so efficient a ranger as
Elias Laycock, a good man on sea and land, to look after
their interests there. The days of illegal netting and
dynamiting in Port Hacking should now soon belong to
the past.

Mr. Olliffe made a sad bungle in the judging of
the Auction Stakes at Moorefleld on Saturday. The
colours of Strephon and Margett were very much alike,
and Mr. Olliffe hoisted the number cf Margett as the
winner. A wild howl went up from the crowd, and it was
not for some minutes that the mistake was rectified, and
the correct numbers hoisted. Luckily for the judge,
Strephon won by fully a length, for had it been a close
thing, the crowd who backed Margett, the favourite,
would not have accepted the changing of the numbers
quite so kindly. Mr. Olliffe should take his mistake to
heart, and thank his stars he got so easily out of the
difficulty.

THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
1st. It is in one word a cure ; it is not merely a
relief, and in no sense a cure-all; it is the product
of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the whole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not. merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is supemdded.
5th. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
Oth. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
SOME AUSTRALIAN EVIDENCE.
The editor of that favorably known and pro-
gressive periodica], the Illustrated Sydney
News, writes that he “lias much pleasure in
giving the proprietors of St. .Jacobs oil his testi-
mony with respect to its wonderful curative
properties. The editor has suffered acutely with
chronic sciatica, and has found the greatest relief
by the application of St. Jacobs oil to the affected
parts, and has no hesitation in recommending it
to sufferers.”
The lady who edits the Band op Mercy
(Sydney), also states that she “can testify to the
value of St. Jacobs oil, as it is used in her family
with great benefit.”
IF YOU WISH
to be worried into an early grave by the
petty inconveniences of this paradoxical sub-
lunary—if you wisli to lose your trams, your
trains, your temper- if you wish to arrive at your
business premises in the morning disposed to
quarrel with everyone you come in contact with,
and to arrive home of an evening in a fit mood to
abuse your wife, baste the baby, kick the cat, or,
indeed, for the matter of that, to “kick the
bucket,” in a sudden fit of splenic apoplexy, why,
buy one of those cheap, trashy, made-up-to-gu!l
Swiss ati’oeities in the shape of a so-called watch.

RELIABLE TIMEKEEPER,
A true and trusty friend and faithful companion
-—if you wish a timekeeper which myriads of
grateful purchasers have satisfied themselves is
fully up to the standard of excellence claimed for
it, the testimony in favour of which is so over-
whelming, the reputation of which is unrivalled,
the durability of which is assured, the construc-
tion of which is simple and such that it rarely gets
out of order, and, in event of accident, can be
repaired at a trifling cost—if you wish a low-cost
and reliable TIMEKEEPER, which has proved
itself worthy of the high encomiums passed upon
it in every clime, by pulpit, press and populace,
you will assuredly huy a Waterhury.

Maggie Flanagan, 13, set f re to the
Oxford Hotel, Maryborough (Q.), because she
disliked one of the boarders, and desired to give
him a foretaste of the hereafter! This case has
its parallel in that of the N.S. Wales buy who the
other day strychnined his employer’s soup,
burned down wheat-stacks and hay-crop, and set
fire to the store-room, “for fun.” Some philan-
thropist ought to bring this interesting couple
together and follow up their history on theRougon-
Macquart principle.
In this excessively hot weather it is com-
forting to know that it is possible to have as much
ice in our homes as one may desire without the
inconvenience of sending for it. The “ Champion
Ice Machine ” will be found most effective, easy
to use and exceedingly cheap, no hotel, or house-
hold, should be without one or more. Tobin and
Davidson’s Patent Limestone Filter is also
strongly recommended and is specially adapted
for Australian water, and for a combination of
butter-cooler and water filter, “ The Gordon
Patent Canvas filter and Refrigerator is to be
highly commended, and is specially suited for out-
door use. Those who have not already secured
one of each of these necessary comforts, should at
once call or write to the agents, Messrs. Holds-
vvorth, M’Pherson & Co., 254 George-st., Sydney.*

A big section of the press continues to
allude to the release of Arthur Rae, the Hay
N S.W. Shearers’ Union Secretary, imprisoned in
default of paying fines imposed upon him for
telling shearers to strike, as “an act of clemency !”
So far as Rae was concerned there was no clemency
about it; the Ministry were only clement to them-
selves, for if they had dared to keep Rae in prison
for a single hour over one month they would
have brought about a social cataclysm to which
the late strike would have been as the song
of a mosquito to the echo of a thnnderblast. In
manufacturing 50 or 70 offences out of Rae’s two
single acts, and ordering him to gaol tor 128
weeks instead of for two fortnights, the law
brought itself into hatred and contempt with every
intelligent citizen.
Now that a satisfactory strike balance-
sheet has been published by the N.S.W. Labour
Defence Committee, the daily newspapers, which
during the conflict industriously hinted, and in
some,cases boldly stated, that the strike-leaders
were receiving weekly sums varying from £(> to
£20 for their services, are, without exception, very
crestfallen, and, with one exception, too dishonest
to acknowledge their mischievous blunder.
Sydney Daily Telegraph admits, unreservedly,
that: “ the public accountants’ report will com-
pletely silence detractors,” and asserts that; “it
will surprise most people to learn the pheno-
menally small amounts that were paid as salaries,”
moreover talks in eulogistic terms of “self-
saeriflee, due care and economy in dealing with
the strike fund,” and ere escaping by a side issue
for slangwhanging purposes, states that: “Many
charitable committees and other bodies concerned
in the collection and distribution of contributions
might learn a valuable lesson from the balance-
sheet issued by the Labour Defence Committee.”

hearts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its'original
Fullness and Beauty.

The Reverend Henry
Jordan, B.A.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Somewhere in the Seventies, I, a newly-
fledged medico, was acting as junior partner in a
practice in a thickly-populated English manufac-
turing district which we may call Westshire. The
work was hard, the pay was poor (a shilling a
visit, medicine included), and the people as rough
a set as one could wish to meet, but needs must
when necessity drives, and without some capital a
medical man can no more hope to enter the secure
haven of decent fees and select society than the
common or garden fanatic has of entering—ah,
well! never mind which place. However, I was
young and full of work, and I dispensed the
rhubarb-and-magnesia with an enthusiasm at
which I have often since shuddered.
Now it happened that my partner had a wife,
and that his wife usually had a curate—that is to
say, being an active young woman with nothing
particular to do, her superfluous energy found its
vent, as superfluous feminine energy often will,
in (iiiufch gossip and that eager enquiry
into the religious condition of all her poorer
neighbours usually known as district-visiting.
All this, of course, would have been somewhat in-
complete without clerical assistance (male), and
accordingly the curate for the time being was
always a welcome and expected guest at the sub-
stantial nine-o’clock supper which, the day’s work
then usually over, formed our principal meal.
He, on his side, finding both the fare and the
society a welcome change from the meagre board
and still more meagre conversation of three old
maiden ladies with whom he was by traditional
custom bound to reside, scarcely ever failed to
put iu an appearance. Accordingly, month after
month, a succession of curates came and went,
said their little grace, ate their little supper,
and every now and then departed to a less un-
regenerate district, a successor appearing in due
course.
The usual course of events varied little. Dixon,
my partner, and myself usually made our appear-
ance a little before nine, and we always found the
young evangelist installed in an arm-chair dis-
cussing with much unction the last sermon or the
lost souls of the benighted wretches who were
then trying to keep themselves and their
families on something less than ten shillings a
week, and who had neither time nor stomach
to think of their eternal salvation. During
supper we carefully saw that the conver-
sation took a mundane turn, and then we two
unconverted ones took our way to the snuggery,
where, with tobacco and whisky, we solaced our-
selves, leaving our guest and his hostess in com-
munion of the soul till half-past ten, after which
hour the three virgin ladies who took charge of the
curate’s morals never allowed him to be out. The
clergymen were all very mild young men, some
milder than others, but a typical “curatical”
mildness pervaded all. Their eyes were mostly
weak, their walk more or less a shuffle, and their
clothes built with clerical amplitude and dis-
regard of wrinkles. One we had who once, in an
unguarded moment, confessed to us a weak desire
to throw off the thraldom in which he was held by
the three virgin sisters aforesaid, so one night, in
the absence of my partner’s wife, we seduced him
into the snuggery, mixed his punch, and kept him
till midnight. But our efforts in the good cause
were unavailing. He was not allowed out for a
week, and then appeared with an expression which
plainly showed that he was more firmly under the
yoke than ever.
* * *
It so happened that L had been absent on
a short holiday, and on my return my partner was
called away on business. Being very busy, I saw
none, of the household till evening, when, on
making my appearance in the dining-room, Mrs.
Dixon greeted me with
“Do you know, we have a new curate?”
This did not particularly interest me, for they
were all the same, but I politely asked, “How do
you like him ? ”
“ Well,” was the answer, “ I am not quite sure.
He is different from the rest, but I have asked him
to come in as often as he can, for really there is
nowhere else for the poor man to go.”
At that moment a knock at the door announced
the arrival of the divine, and a tall man,
apparently about thirty, was introduced to me as
the Reverend Henry Jordan. During supper if
had an opportunity of noticing my new acquaint
ance more closely. Ho had a face almost im
possible to describe, since there was nothing
tangible to be seized on; in fact, the only
characteristic traits were a pair of piercing eyes,
spoilt by their extreme shiftiness, and a certain
restlessness of manner which might have been
due to nervousness. But about one thing there
was no doubt, and that was- his conversational
ability. He could talk well, and we soon had the
ball merrily rolling. At last, during a pause in
the conversation, he said ;
“Do you know, Mrs. Dixon, I shall have to
take extreme measures with those old tabbies.
They won’t give me a latch-key.”
I give you my word he called them “old
tabbies, ” the three respectable spinsters who had
watched over so many generations of curates.
Mrs. Dixon blushed, looked a little uneasy and
finally smiled, for after all they were dear friends
of hers, and not altogether ungiven to gossip. My
heart was ah-eady warming to the man, but the
worst was yet to come.
Supper finished, I rose, and prepared to enjoy
my well-earned pipe, but ere I could leave the
room the Rev. Henry Jordan caught my eye.
“ My dear fellow,” he said, “are you going to
have a smoke? I must come with you. I hope
you will not think me rude, Mrs. Dixon, but it is
an absolute necessity for me. Of course I only do
it under medical advice, but the fact is I suffer so
from nervous palpitation ” —and with a low bow,
a white hand pressed gracefully over the region of
the heart, as indicating the place where the
nervous palpitations were supposed to occur, lie
gracefully glided from the room. I did not stop
to look at Mrs. Dixon, but made all haste to the
snuggery.
“Now, then,” said the Rev. Henry Jordan,
lighting a well-seasoned briar-root and mixing
himself a stiff nobbier from the jar of Kinahan’s
best, “this is what 1 call comfort. That is the
worst of women,” he pensively continued, “they
want religion in season and out of season. Now
I like medical men —they generally take their
religion weak and their whisky strong.” Then
with a quick look at me and a laugh, “Don’t
misunderstand me ; it is true I am a clergyman,
but even clergymen require a little relaxation
sometimes.”
So we relaxed.
At half-post ten he rose to go. “ I am making,”
he said, “some little allowance for the prejudices
of the three ancient ladies with whom I reside.
In a new place, and when one has a reputation to
uphold, it is necessary to move carefully. But,
mark my words, I shall have a latch-key before
long. ”
And he was as good as his word, for abqut a
week afterwards, he said one night—
It is sometimes better to compromise matters
than to gain an absolute victory, especially when
one is a minister of the gospel. I have not got a
latch-key, but I have got this.”
And ho produced a huge door-key, some nine
inches long, which he deposited on the table with
a loud clump and a deep sigh of satisfaction.
In the meantime, many a good night in the
snuggery had succeeded the first, and they were
now usually prolonged into the small hours/ Each
I night after supper my partner and myself escaped
j with an air of conscious guilt, but the Rev, Henry
j Jordan paused a few moments, made the politest
| of adieux to his somewhat crestfallen hostess, and
[ walked away with the air of one proud of doing
I I)is duty.
His conversation was charming and full of a
large-hearted toleration.
“You two,” lie said to us one night, helping
himself to another nobbier, “say that you are
Agnostics. Brought up in the school of Huxley
and Darwin, you have taken these great men as
your guides. Well, it is not for me to say you are
necessarily wrong. Because I believe one thing,
is it necessary that 1 should be continually trying
to make you believe the same? No, my dear
fellows, there is good in all things. One of our
greatest authorities lias even said that he can
understand a man’s belief in Mahomet, and if in
Mahomet, why not in Huxley ? It has always
been my boast that my entire sympathies are with
the Broad Church party. By the way, Dixon,
what was that good story you had about that girl
in Weaver’s Lane ?”
And yet, the next day, passing him in the
street when he was walking with his rector, I
could have sworn that I heard him say :
“As you were remarking, my dear sir, we can-
not be too careful about resisting the onslaughts
of a too-enquiring spirit. As you justly observe,
it is to the High Church party that belongs the
credit of preserving in its pristine purity our noble
religion.”
And the same evening, pausing for a moment
on leaving the dining-room to take something
from a rack in the hall, I heard him remark,
without a tremor in his voice, as he prepared to
follow :
“My dear Mrs. Dixon, you will, I am afraid,
think me very rude always to run away like this, j
but I feel sure that you understand my motives.
Men of scientific attainments such as your hus-
band are apt to look too much to the materialistic
side of life, and a few words in season from a
humble worker such as myself are often of benefit
to a mind in doubt. These evenings afford me the
only chance I have to exert any good influence.
Some day you will, I think, rejoice that I have
been given this opportunity. Good night, my
dear Mrs. Dixon.”
But that night we discovered to our horror that
there was absolutely no whisky in the house, the
fresh supply ordered not having arrived. Con-
sternation was expressed on all our faces.
Dixon said, “ Well I’m d— —d !”
I echoed the sentiment.
But the Rev. Henry Jordan, after thinking for
a few moments, pensively remarked,
“ I think I have heard that it is the custom of
you medical men to keep what you call absolute
alcohol, the purest form of spirit, in your surgery.
If I might venture to suggest it, possibly a small
modicum, with the addition, say. of a little
syrup of lemon, and perhaps a clove, might, with
some sugar and hot water, make a not altogether
unpalatable drink.”
Out spirits rose, for we had not thought of this.
I hauled down the necessary jars, and, with the
skill of a master, his reverence concocted the brew;
and many is the shilling I have since paid for a
nobbier of whisky that could not compare with
it.
# # #
In the meantime, there was one thing
upon which all the inhabitants of W were
agreed—that never had so estimable a man and so
splendid a preacher been known in the town.
Mrs. Dixon, sore as she felt at his desertion of
herself, was forced to admit that his equal in the
pulpit she had never heard. A neighboring living
falling vacant, it was at once offered to him, but
declined ; the grounds being, as he confided to me
in confidence, that “my views are too broad, my
dear fellow, and I feel that I must seek a wider
sphere of activity, perhaps beyond the seas, in
one of our great polonies or in America.”
80 far I had never heard him preach, having
neither the time nor the inclination to go to
church; but one night, impelled by curiosity, I
took a seat in time for the sermon. His reputation
was certainly not undeserved for he gave one of the
best sermons I have ever heard. Standing erect
in the pulpit, his restless eyes seeming to seek out
every member of the congregation in turn, he
preached without book or note and he preached in
earnest. There was no whine, there was no pray-
ing, but a clever and effective denunciation of every
vice dr weakness he could imagine before him.
Once towards the end I fancied that he faltered
for a moment, but immediately after the sermon
was over and the audience filed out, the usual con-
cluding hymn being that night unaccountably
omitted by the minister.
# # #
A quarter-of-an-hour afterwards I was
standing at the surgery door when I saw the
curate coming towards me. He carried a small
portmanteau and looked hurried.
“ Will you do me a great favour?he said. “ 1
am going into B by the night train and I do
not wish anyone to know. If you are asked will
you say that I told you I was going to walk over
to C ? ”
I looked him in the face and said, “ Yes.'*
He shook my hand and hurried away.
Five minutes afterwards, when I was still smok-
ing at the same place, two men came up to me.
“ The parson here?” they said.
“ What parson ?”
“ Mr. Jordan, as he calls himself.”
“No.”
“ Have you seen him ?”
“ Y r es.”
“When?”
“Five minutes ago.”
“ Where has he gone—which way?”
I heard the whistle of the train away down to
the left as I pointed to the right, and said, “He
is walking over to C ”
“Come along, Bill,” said one, “we have him
this time, shifty as he’s shown himself.”
But they were wrong, for they never saw the
Rev. Henry Jordan again.
How he got the warning which enabled him to
escape, or what he was exactly wanted for, we
never heard. Forgery it was supposed. All that
we knew for certain was that this was no clergy-
man at all, and that the real Rev. Henry Jordan,
whose name and degree had been borrowed, was a
modest curate residing in a remote corner of
Cornwall. His horror at discovering the liberty
which had been taken with his name is supposed
to have given him a shock from which he never
recovered.
Did Ido wrong ? For my part I think not, for
this 1 know, he was the only oarson I have ever
been able to get on with.
* # #
Some years afterwards 1 was driving
hurriedly in a cab to catch a steamer in one of the
capital cities of Australia. Suddenly I saw
coming along the footpath a tall figure in clerical
garb. It looked familiar to me from the first,
but, as it approached closer, there was no mis-
taking the expressionless face, with the piercing,
shifty eyes. He caught sight of me, there was an
instantaneous flash of recognition, and then the
cab bore me out of sight. I have never since set
foot in that city, but I have often wondered under
what denomination and under what name he is
delighting a cultured audience. Perchance should
he catch sight of this he may remember the night
that he brewed the grog in the doctor’s shop in
England.

W. G. Spence testifies that the A.S. U.

It now transpires that the awful smash of
the Union Bank of South Africa was brought
about by one affable customer, who called round
and procured an overdraft of £554,455. He seems
to have put the money in his inside pocket and
gone away, and a few weeks later the bank closed
up for want of it.
The notorious Albanian bandit, Hadji
Tillman, before he was led to execution, expressed
a last wish to make a meal of curried mutton.
But as the Turkish cook did not understand how-
to prepare the dish, the culprit pushed back his
plate, saying : “ If I ate any of that stuff I should
have dyspepsia for a week at the very least.”
A London magistrate has been hauled over
the coals for inviting four young lordlings to take
seats on the Bench at the first hearing of the
Hampstead murder case. These beaks are terrors
for introducing the majesty of the Law to good
society. There was Panton-de-Beerthir.st, for
instance—but it’s time that that long slender arm
of justice had a rest.
Rev. James W. Ford, for more than half
a century a missionary in China, and alleged
founder of the first Christian church in that
country, says : “After studying the Chinese lan-
guage for ten years, I translated the New Testa-
ment and other works. I began to preach, in a
way, immediately after I entered Siam, but
though I have studied for fifty years, I do not yet
think that I have mastered the Chinese language.”
This should be immensely encouraging to the
uninstructed and commonplace persons who, with
a view to converting John Chinaman to Jay-
bullism, left Australia the other day by the Men-
muir.
Premier Parkes doesn’t know everything,
and he put his foot into it terribly when, in Par-
liament the other day, he quoted* Melancthon as
an upholder of divorce. Cardinal Moran points
out —an unquestionable and easily-ascertainable
historical fact—that Melancthon, while denying
that a man had any right to divorce his wife, on
more than one great occasion lent his sacred smile
to the act of taking a second wife while the first
was still alive. And now somebody points out,
for the benefit of Cardinal Moran, that the then
Pope’s share in the divorce of Henry VIII. from
Ids brother’s widow, whom he married by a Papal
dispensation, won’t stand examination from the
point of view of those who alike object to bigamy
and to divorce.
The Colonial Ice Co., Limited, are to be
congratulated on their phenomenal success and on
the firm and substantial support they are meeting
with. This result is to be attributed both to the
purity of the ice supplied and to their care and
promptitude in executing their orders daily. The
Company’s office and works are in Regent-street,
Redfern, and will amply repay a visit. Here can
be seen the manufacture of ice from its inception
and a glance into the enormous store-room
(capable of holding several hundreds of tons)
makes one feel as if he had collided against an
iceberg. The cooling-room is also a notable feature,
and is already largely utilised by butchers, &c.,
for preserving meat during the hot season. This
room is divided into compartments each with a
separate door, the tenant of each holding a key,
at a very moderate rent; a uniform temperature
is maintained and the cleanliness and absence of
all unpleasantness is most apparent. The present
plant and staff of the Company are taxed to the
utmost in fulfilling their orders, and it is the in-
tention to largely increase the accommodation at
no distant date to meet the increasing require-
ments of the trade.*

Rain in torrents, rain in sheets—and two
hundred convicts out in the storm. Huddled
together, with heads bent on their breasts so that
their faces at least shall be protected from the
deluge, they stand in the main barrack-yard as
they have stood for 30 minutes past and will con-
tinue to stand for another 120 unless Heaven or
its Sarah Island representative inclines to mercy.
And the cutting, salt rain dashes upon them and
soaks them through and through and leaves never
a dry stitch among the lot.
# * *
“Grand rain,” remarks Captain Bankes,
Commandant, as ho chalks his cue in the billiard-
room thrown out (at His Majesty’s expense) from
the gable-end of Officers’ Quarters.
“\fes,” rejoins Lieutenant Darrell, his oppo-
nent, as he asks Forger Joe, the marker, for the
score and prepares for his shot; “grand rain—
’ll do a lot of good. It’ll bring up that young
wheat in No. Nine paddock splendidly.” Ho
cannons., “If we get a small harvest on that
experimental crop I’d suggest—damn, what d’ye
mean, pris’ner, coming in like that?” (Ho has
missed his stroke.) “I’ve a good mind to give you
twenty, sir, interfering with my stroke!”
The intruding convict-servant salutes and
makes humble and trembling reply : “I knocked,
sir, I did. Thought you told me to come in, sir.
I came to tell you, sir, as Church was waitin’.”
“Ob, damn Church, and 1 don't believe you,
pris’ner. You didn’t knock, and if you tell me t o
again I’ll give you lifty for lying. Now, did you
knock ?”
The poor half-witted fool instantly impales him-
self upon the dilemma so ingeniously offered him
by Lieutenant Darrell.
sir—l didn’t knock.”
“ Then why did you say you did? You area
liar, then, are you? Come up for punishment to-
morrow morning and evening—a ‘dozen’ each
time. D’ye hear?”
The convict servant retires, knowing he is
wronged, and yet understanding, too, that lie has
blundered somehow. Lieutenant Darrell, whose
turn it is for Muster and Church duty, throws
down his cuo grumbliugly, and dons his i belts.
Captain Bankes, glancing through the window,
resolves that ho won’t do inspection-rounds to-day.
The grand rain shall not fall to-day upon the Just,

SMITH: “By Jove, they are, old chappie. Starving in Sydney, I came to
Protectionist Melbourne, got a good billet, live well, and as I
buy my clothes at Crawford, King & Co.'s wholesale store, I can
turn out decently for about three notes.
It must content itself with the Unjust.
“ 1 won’t inspect this morning, Darrell. Live
’em short Church and half the Regulations, and
let “ Complaints ” stand over. Come back quickly
and we’ll finish this game before lunch. \V hats
the score, marker? ”
“ Forty—thirty-eight, sir,” respectfully answers
Forger Joe, “ And, bog pardon, Mr. Darrell, but
Birch did knock, sir. 1 heard him.” .
“ What’s that ? What right have you to inter-
fere? Out to Muster, my man, at once! Wo
don’t own any favourites here, and don’t permit
shirking by the billiard-room fire when Church-
H J
parade’s on.”
And out,in the storm of rain and sleet, from his
snuggery in the billiard-room, went Forger Joe.
Though the outer world was bleak and damp,
nevertheless Forger Joe should not have come to
the r solution which he then and there did. If a
man interferes on behalf of truth ami justice, he
should not be surprised at receiving the reward
customarily granted by society for such conduct.
Those who bemoan the thorns of the martyr’scrown
should not commit the deeds which win them a
place in .the martyrology. And Forger Joe,
though he did not regret that he had made his
interjection in the interest of billet-servant Birch,
I lamented in his'heart the loss of the warm shelter
in which ho had expected to pass the Sunday.
« •
For, of course, you will have understood
by this time that this particular day was Sunday.
Intensely solicitous as the System was for the
religious and moral development of its Children,
it stands to reason that it could not spare time for
prayers except on Sundays. And so devoted to
duty were Messrs. Bankes and Darrell that by the
time they had got through their week-day round
of supervision and chastisement, they were, as a
rule, too weary even for billiards. Thus their
combats with the cue were generally reserved for
the Sabbath-day.
Before muster and after lunch on Sundays, the
click-click of the balls was wont to sound merrily
from the square-roofed annexe to the barracks,
and Forger Joe had been greatly envied of his
brother-felons. The opportunity of witnessing
pretty play between the superior officers of the
Settlement was an inestimable privilege, to say
nothing of the cigar-ends that Captain Bankes —
not Darrell, you may be sure!—was so forgetful
about; or of the circumstance that the marker was
“ free of Muster.” Not that he was exempted by
Regulation. That could hardly be, inasmuch as
billiard-tables and markers wore unknown to the
King’s Regulations. He was permitted to absent
himself by grace of the Commandant or the
Lieutenant. Which quality generally superseded
the Regulations when it was a matter of meeting
the officer’s convenience.
No, Forger Joe did not feel pleased when, by
the fiat of that Angel of Justice, Darrell, he
was driven from the Paradise of the billiard-
room to the outer world where there was gnashing
of teeth and shaking of chilled limbs. And the
devil coiled himself down into Joe’s breast, and
doubtless laughed gaily.

the majority of the “congregation ” in “ Church’’
momentarily gave place to a thrill of genuine

INDISPUTABLE EVIDENCE
OF SUPERIORITY.
DR. REDWOOD, Ph.D., F.C.S., F.1.C.,
Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain.
“My analytical and practical experience of Pears’
Soap now extends over a very lengthened period—nearly fifty years—
“during which time
“I have never come across another Toilet
“ Soap which so closely realises my ideal
“of perfection;
its purity is such that it may be used with perfect confidence upon the
tenderest and most sensitive skin—even that of a new horn babe.’’
excitement as they saw Joe emerge from the
billiard-room and slouch over the soddened gravel
to join them.
“What’s up?” went round in eager whispers.
“ Joe’s in for it!” A score or two wretches
instantly made up their minds to fill the marker-
ship, vice Joe, dismissed, if they could.
* * *
The muster began. Under the eaves of
the narrow verandah stood a row of soldiers.
Behind these the mustering Overseer, other
subordinate officials, and that great man, Lieu-
tenant Darrell. Out in the rain, the convicts.
The rain plashed and splashed as the voices
rang out in call and ansvver. By number, and
name and ship was each convict called, and a
simple '‘Here !” from the man himself, when the
man was present, constituted the response. When
the man was not present, if his whereabouts were
known, a warder answered for him. If they were
unknown, then the presumption was that he had
escaped, and “ Absconded ” would be pencilled
opposite his name.
The absent prisoner might still be within Set-
tlement boundaries ; he might be away on some
officer’s message, the answering warder being in
ignorance of the fact; he might actually be an
absconder; but whatever was the occasion of his
absence it would be all one in the result. Down
would go “ Absconded !” opposite his name.
Now at this period, and for years after, for that
word to be placed over or against one’s name was
to be literally under sentence of death.
£'<
The muster continued somewhat in this
way :
“Bond, John, 440, Asia?”—“Here!”
“ Fulbert, Erie, 12,930, Marquis of Hastings?”
“Billet ” (from the warder).
“Gordon, Charles, 17,211, Pestonjee Boman-
jee ?” “ Gaol—condemned cell. ”
“Irvine, William, 103, Ocean?”—“Gaol- Hos-
pital.” (Irvine was suffering a recovery from a
flogging.)
“Jones, Robert, .9439, Sussex ’’’--“Refractory
cell, Grummet Island.”
“Judson, Joseph, 11,889, Royal Sovereign?”
No answer. Only a movement of heads.
“ Call him again,” shouted Darrell. And once
more, overbearing the rush and dash of the
incessant rain, Joseph Judson’s name was called.
Again there was no answer. Again there was
no sound except the falling rain and the rustle of
heads craning and moving sideways to catch a
glimpse of Forger Joe.
“Call him, the third time,” said Darrell, “and
if he fail to answer, report him as absconded.”
For the third time, in a still higher key, the
Overseer uttered: “Judson, Joseph, 11,889,
Royal Sovereign,” and still Joseph Judson, alias
“Fprger Joe,” was mute. Unaccountably so!
One would think Joe really desired to entrust
himself to the tender mercies and polite ministra
tions # of Brother Dougherty, the Hobart Town
hangman.
“Joseph Judson, absconded, ” cried the Over-
seer, and turning to Lieutenant Darrell he con-
tinued : “I report Joseph Judson, No. 11,889,
ship Royal Sovereign, as absconded, sir. Usual
instructions ? ”
“Usual instructions. Inform the guards. If
the absconder is found within the bounds, chal-
lenge once, and in default of immediate surrender,
fire. If without the bounds, fire.”
1 “ And then challenge,” said a voice in the felon-
throng, “Scarborough fashion !”f
“ Who said that?” repeated Darrell. For reply,
the throng opened, and closed again, and Forger
Joe, who had taken his place on the right wing,
was now standing in the centre of the crowd.
Darrell stepped into the front—out into the
heavily-beating rain. His face bore the look
which nearly every convict dreaded—the look of
irresponsible power mad for theassertion of its rights
and lustful of revenge ; such a look as John Price
used to wear in the ’Forties and ’Fifties—as he
wore the day he was killed at Williamstown Pier.
“Who said that?” Darrell asked again. And
then a prisoner—one of the aspirants for Judson’s
billet—whimpered : “ Forger Joe, sir.”
“Forger Joe!” —the Lieutenant admirably
simulated a start of surprise. Forger Joe—
Joseph Judson here? Joseph Judson, the
absconder? Ah, I see him!” With that, he
drove himself, wedge-like, into the massed con-
victs, and, seizing Joe by the collar of his coat
pulled him from their midst to the shelter of the
ranged muskets. So rapid was the action —it
seemed as.though it had taken place between the
falling of one rain-drop and of another—that the
prisoners did not realise its happening till they
saw Joe lying in the puddles by the soldiers’ feet.
“It was you, was it, Marker Joe?’ said the
officer. “You found your voice, then, did you ?
You couldn’t answer the muster-call, though!
Don’t you know, you fool, what your silence
means ? Don’t you know you’re an absconder-
condemned to death ! That’s what you’ve got for
sulking, my man!”
Forger Joe tried to rise. He was prostrate in
a couple of indies of water, and the overflow from
the eaves fell copiously upon him. At a signal
from Lieut. Darrell a couple of guards thrust him
back with the butts of their muskets.
“ Keep him down!” ordered Darrell; “ bayonets
downwards, and, Overseer, proceed !”
They finished the calling-over, Convict Judson
cooling his temper the while in the puddles and
underneath the steel-points.
“Any complaints?” called the Overseer. A
dozen hands were thrust forth.
“ Complaints must wait till next week,” said
Darrell. ,
Then they had prayers.
Dor, you will remember, this little episode
occurred in “Church.”
* * *
Half-an-hour later Lieutenant Darrell re-
ported to Captain Bankes, who was seated by the
billiai’d-room fire reading from a twelve-month-
old copy of the London Magazine.
“Ah, Darrell, back ?”
“ Wsir. ’Report, sir , ”
“Oh, hang report. Just listen here. It’s a
letter from that fellow, James Elia to Judge
Field. Delightfully rich ! Wonder how the
Mancipists ’ll like it !” And Captain Bankes,
who was careful to keep up his reading in the in-
tervals of flogging prisoners, and prided himself
equally upon his literary taste and his capacity for
making the System pay, extracted the plums from
Charles Lamb’s communication to Barron Field.
“ I cannot imagine to myself whereabout you are. . . .
Sometimes you seem to be in the Hades of Thieves. I
sec Diogenes prying among you with his perpetual fruit-
less lantern. What must you be willing by this time to
give for the sight of an honest man ! You must almost
have forgotten how we look ”
“That’s deuced insulting to the Staff,” said
Darrell. “That damned scribbler forgets there
are English gentlemen holding official positions in
the colonies.”
Bankes went on :
“And tell me what your Sydneyites do? Are they
th**v ng all day long ? Merciful Heaven ! what property
can stand against such a depredation ! ... Is there
much difference to see between the son of a th**f, and
the grandson? or where does the taint stop?”
“Splendid !” exclaimed the Commandant. The
Lieutenant grinned a“Ha ! Ha ! That shot’ll go
home ! ”
“ That’s more than the ’mancipists can do,
then,” chuckled the Superior as he ended his
quotations :
“Do you bleach in three or four generations ? Do you
grow your own hemp? What is your staple trade, ex-
clusive of the national profession, I mean? Your lock-
smiths, 1 take it, are some of 30U1* great capitalists.”
“’Gad!” exclaimed Bankes, throwing the
periodical down and leaning back in his chair to
laugh more at ease, “That’ll do for Field in the
old town. He won’t write many more ‘ Botany
Bay Flowers ’ there, I should say !”
But that’s not half a bad hint about the hemp,
sir,” suggested Lieutenant Darrell, in all serious-
ness. “ And I don’t see why we shouldn’t make
a trial of it here. I feel sure we’ll never succeed
with gram, and we really ought to cultivate more
ground. Now, there’ll always be a big demand
for hemp in the colonies.!
. <£ Fll think of it,” replied Bankes, and, to anti-
cipate a little, we may say that in the following
year No. 9 paddock was sown with hemp. The
crop, however, fortunately for Charles Lamb’s
fame, was a failure. Nature did a lot to accom-
modate the System. Tommy Townshend, after-
wards Lord Sydney, was quite convinced there
was a Divine leading ”in the discovery of the
Australias, just yvhen Howard had kicked up such
a row over the condition of British prisons ; and, in
the words of Colonel Sorell, “Providence must
have designed Macquarie Harbour for a prison.”
Governor Arthur said much the same thing res-
pecting Tasman’s Peninsula generally and Port
Arthur in particular ; and John Price was almost
equally as emphatic in his approval of the wisdom
which had so completely isolated Norfolk Island.
Nature (in the opinion of the System) was partial
to it, and yet, singular to state, she drew the line
at hemp. To this day the Australias are obliged
to import their hangmen’s ropes.
* * *
Commandant Bankes, having thus inti-
mated that he would keep an eye on the desira-
bility of meeting the System’s requirements, asked
for the Report.
The Report was the document which reflected
the_“ strength ” of the Settlement and the dis-
position of tlie prisoners and guards.
When he came to the column headed “Ab-
sconded since last report,” he was surprised into
“ Hello ! Forger .1 oe bolted ! The beggar lost no
time. I s’pose that’s because you ordered him to
muster.”
“Look at next column, please, sir,” said
Darrell complacently. For, of course, Darrell,
being a very exact book-keeper and a model of
method, had also entered Joe’s name in the
“absconders recaptured since last report ” column.
“Ah ! That’s good ! You lost no time either.
Now, what shall we do with him ? Of course, it’s
death.”
“Yes, it’s death. I’ve put him in the Con-
demned Cell.”
“ So I see, ’ the Commandant replied, for he had
noticed that the “Condemned Cells ” column had
been increased by one. The total was now 7 ;
yesterday it was only G.
“Those cells are getting crowded, sir,” re-
marked Darrell. “Shall we hand him over to
Skeleton Johnny here,)! or wait for the schooner
and send him to Dougherty 7 ? She won’t be down
for a month yet.
“ H’m ! Ah! Don’t know, I’m sure. You see,
Darrell, it doesn’t do to hang too many here. An
odd one now and then doesn’t matter when the
Cyprus is away and the gaol’s full, or even half-
a-dozen in an emergency; but we gave Johnny two
last month, y’know. No; I don’t think we’ll
hang our marker this time. Suppose we maroon
him? Three months at the Grummet’ll be a
change from his billet here.
“It’s as you please, sir.” And in this solemn
manner as suggestive of the majesty of law as of
the incorruptibility of justice, was the fate of
Convict Joseph Judson, alias Forger Joe. No.
11,889, per Royal Sovereign, decided.
* * #
It pains us to have to record that the event
(Continued on page 24.)
'This is not sarcasm. Dogherty, or Dougherty - the
former spelling follows the Gazette, the latter of his
death-warrant—was the most gentlemanly of the many
functionaries who in the Australian provinces have
politely invited their fellow creatures to step out and be
hanged. One man round whose neck Dougherty had just,
knotted the rope informed (after his reprieve on the
scaffold) the late excellent T. .1. Crouch, of Hobart, that
‘‘a lady couldn't have done it nicer,” and this person’s
judgment should be regarded as decisive, as on two former
occasions he had been the recipient of delicate attentions
from an executioner. It is pleasing to know that
first-hand testimony corroborates the statements of two
distinguished historians, the Reverend John West and Mr.
James Bonwick, respecting this useful and genial official.
“There was no amateur gaiety in his (Dougherty’s)
manner,” writes Mr. West; “no harshness in his speech.”
And Mr. Bonwick says : “ It was his trade to give the lash
and tie the last knot; but he did the one with gentleness
and the other with decent solemnity. ... He sought
to drown the remembrance of his professional duties’ in
the cup of intoxication ; the day following an execution
he always spent in a drunken stupor. Disgusted with his
trade he contemplated retirement from public life ; but the
multiplicity of applications for Ids position restored his
sef-respect, and reconciled him to the degradation of his
ojjice.” The italics are mine, not Mr. Bonwick’s. Dougherty
did eventually retire from public life—suddenly.
t “Scarborough fashion’’—First knock a man down
then bid him stand.
fThis conversation and its sequel is historic. Noble
Mr. Schofield, Wesleyan missionary to Macquarie Har-
bour, when af Hell’s Gates received a parcel of books,
papers, &c., from the Wesleyan Missionary Society'!
offices, London, some of the wrappers of which consisted
of several loose sheets of the London Magazine for 1822-3
On one of these sheets Mr. Schofield read Elia’s “Distant
Correspondents.” The “ 8.F.” of that famous essay, and
of the delightful “ Mockery End, in Hertfordshire,” was
Barron Field, of Sydney, the hanging judge who was
known to have completed a poetic couplet with the same
dip of ink with which he had just written “Let him be
hanged ” against a criminal’s name.
||“ Skeleton Johnny’’—“Jack Ketch,” or the hangman.
“ To give him to Johnny ” was to hand a man over to the
hangman.

What we are Prepared to do
We are prepared to supply 100,000 of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A Word of Advice.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Read our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or vours need or would be benefited
by the use of 'FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and * safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
complexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation.
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them with-
-1 out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
Why do we take this Risk?
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZEE’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimnation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
Do I need them?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease.
If you have Constipation, Yes. They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Depot, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward off Typhoid and all other infectious and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price Is. 6d., (post free, Is. Bd.), and are for sale
by most Chemists and Storekeepers throughout Australasia.

where the Administration was wont to lodge
refractories,’lf and informed him of his destina-
tion, he stormed and raged. It was just like that
; " card Harrell that it was, to revenge himself
in that mean way. What the devil did they think
he d shut Ins mouth for at Muster if it wasn’t to
be sent to Hobart Town as an absconder under
sentence of death ? He was tired of this hole, ho
was, and wanted a change. Bankes and Harrell
were afraid of his letting a little light in on their
proceedings, and that’s why they objected to his
getting a change to the city. They didn’t want
J”?®. Hobart Town people to know about their
billiard-room and their women. And more im-
potent rigmarole to the same effect.
Speech of this kind was not only impolitic, but
absurd and wicked. Impolitic, because an intelli-
gent man like Forger.loe should have reflected
that Messrs. Bankes and Darrell’s administrative
proceedings would be certain to meet with
approval from the Authorities, and that being so,
the two officers need not care the snap of a finger
for the trumpery public opinion of the capital.
Absurd, because the billiard-table had been
charged by the military chest to the Settlement
not as a billiard-table, but as a comprehensive
assortment of commissariat stores, which in-
cluded boots and shirts, yellow-and-black suits,
leg-uons, handcuffs and basils, Sydney meal and
West India rum. ( English gentleman on the Staff
were given to little dodges of this sort). And
wicked, because, though Messrs. Banks and
Harrells Unisons with the female transports were
unblessed by the Church, they had nevertheless
been favoured with the sanction and example of
Governor Scroll.
* * *
He was landed on the Grummet at mid-
day- fettered and manacled. The boat, however
carried his handcuffs back to Sarah island The
chains they loft him. The stock of “darbies”
was rather low, but of chains the Establishment
had a very ample supply. It would not matter
very much if he did throw his leg-irons into
the sea.
With the body of Forger Joe the boat-overseer
deposited on the rock the material nouishment for
its sustenance during the period of the sentence.
As follows:
1 bag maize-meal.
1 bag salt.
1 keg of water.
X blanket.
1 pannikin.
1 Bible.
The bag of meal weighed (ii)lbs. ; that of salt,
11,,1 b5.; the keg’s contents measured 12 gallons,
these quantities were to keep the life in Convict
dud son for the period of 92 days for which he
was to be marooned, and were computed accord-
ing to the gaol-ration scale of 12ozs. meal, 2ozs.
salt, and 1 pint of water daily. You will observe,
it you take the trouble to check the calculation of
the Settlement commissariat-clerk, that he Aas
liberal in the matter of water. Water at the Set-
tlement cost nothing, or less than nothing, to pro-
cure : only the groans and sighs of the whipped
cask-earners ; hence the System could afford to be
liberal. It was not quite so generous with respect
to tno meal and the salt, inasmuch as it weighed
the “bag in,” and the convict was therefore
W™ an equivalent to one day’s ration.
Which the System, in its peculiarly playful
fashion, did not think a point worth consideration
Supposing a prisoner did go for a day without
food—if meal and water mixed could be termed
food—it was only a fast, and fasting was good for
the soul; and that the System did not neglect the
maroon s soul is proved by “ 1 Bible.” If, on the
other hand, he objected to fast, he was at liberty
to eat the bag. And then the System would flo"
him for destroying Government property.
* * #
Furnished with his supjilies, Forger Joe
waded through the surf and was welcomed by his
fellow-maroon, Robert Jones, No. 9439, per Sussex.
“Hello, Joe ! old boy, wot brought yer ’ere?”
“The boat,” answered Joe, grumpily.'
“So I see. But don’t yer think as yer’d better
be perlite, Joe? Yer out o’ favour with the
Com dant’ or yer ’udn’t be ’ere, so yer needn’t be
tofhsli, Joe.”
The new-arrival failing to reply, the affable
Jones continued : “We’ve ter be mates, Joe
for nother three months at least—’ow lonir’r ver
fur?” ° J
Joe seated himself on his meal-bag and, seizing
a loose piece of rock, began to “oval” his chains.
T 1 ’’ 'I Ol }° S ' ar ff umellt was not without force. As
they had to be mates, their relations would not
bo worse for a display of. cordiality on his part,
so, thawing, he told Jones of the circumstances
leading to his marooning.
“Ah! I thought they ’udn’t give yer less’n
quarter quid. An’ now, matie, I’ll do th’
onners. ”
* # *
With the graciousness of a well-mannered
host, Jones showed Joe over the rock—first' assist-
mgto free Joe’s feet from his chains. Not'a very
u when there was ample rock about.
Ere s yer quarters, Joe,” he said, pointing to
a wave-worn recess a couple of feet above high-
water-mark. “Yer won’ be so bad, ’cepting
wen the sou’-wester’s on. Then the sea’s over
ev ry d inch o’ th’ rock. Yer get a ’eap o’ the
sand up, wrap yer toes in yer jacket, an’ yer body
in th blankut, an’ smuggle down into the sand,
an there yer are, as right as tuppence. An’ ver
kin sleep as long’s yer like. There’s no mornin’
beli. .Leastways, as long’s the waves ’nil let yer,
an there s no sou’-wester more’n three or four
times a-week. No mornin’ bell, Joe, an’ wot’s
better, .Joe, no silunse bell either. Sumtimes
though, w’en the winds off-shore, an’ I’m tucked
up in the cave, I jist ketch the sound o’ the
silunse bell. An’ then wot does I do, d’ye think’”
“ What?” queried Joe interested, and anxious
to loam the ms and outs of life on the Grummet.
I gets up, 1 comes out, I ’alloos and shouts at
th’ top o’ my voice, I defies ’em tor silunse me, and
I puts my fingers ter my nose and tells th’
orthoritfea ter go to th’ devil. Nex’ day, Joe, I
don t mind th waves, even if they does go over
th’ rock. Fur I’ve ’ed my larf at th’ Systum, Joe.
And, Joe, m’ boy, that’s wuth ’eap's ! ”
* * #
One week passed, two, three in this com-
panionship. The marooned mates had their laugh
at the System together when over the. waves
sweetly stealing into their ears with the rustle of
the fresh land breeze, there came the silence bell •
together they bore the heat of the day, and the
dreadful burden of the stormy nights'when the
sea-horses dashed their manes of foam into their
sleeping caverns; and when the elements shrieked
and roared about the rock- as though the lost
spirits of that other world so faithfully repre-
sented on earth by Macquarie Harbour Settle-
ment had m very truth forced their way through
Hell s Gates; together they mixed their cold meal
and water, and together they nourished their
shrunken carcases upon it; together they rose to
salute the pilot-boat as it flew by on patrol duty ;
together they shook each other’s clenched fists at
it as it disappeared behind Bloody Point—it was
not safe to do so till she had rounded the cliff, for
the boat-constable had a good glass, and the
A run no strati oll was apt to view impertinence
with displeasure ; together they laughed and sang
when they felt their freedom ; together they cried
amd cursed, and together they trembled and
shivered when the angry sea drenched them with
us spume and isolated them with its horror-
together they mocked Heaven, and together they
read the Bible.
Bor three weeks, then—
One night, waking from a dream of love and
light—-a phosphorescent gleam from a midnight
wave had touched his eyelids and brought him to
consciousness—Borger Joe, over the bulwark of
stones which he had erected in the mouth of his
cave, saw the figure of his mate outlined against
the grey walls of the sky.
He rose noiselessly, and watched Jones turn
over the small rock with which they had closed
the recess where they kept their meal-barns. Into
his—Joe’s—bag went Jones’ hand ■ then ‘ into bis
own. Once, twice was this done. Then Jones
returned to his cave to sleep the sleep of the
innocent.
* * #
At least; he said he was innocent when, the
next morning, Borger Joe taxed him with tho’deed
winch was not so much a conteniptib’e theft as a
deadly treachery.
“ We’ll soon sec, ’’ said Joc. “ We’ll measure
And ration by ration Joe weighed out Ids
meal in Ins hands. He had emptied the bag on his
jacket, and as ho balanced each handful replaced
it in the canvas pocket.
i da y s - Twenty rations gone—72
should be left.” '
There were not GO. Jones must have been at
the business of transfer for several iiGhts Of
course he would not take too much at once. "
You’ve been living well, Jones ! I thought
you were keeping up flesh remarkably well
Vonre a nice ’un now, aint you ? To starve me—
that was your little game. Or make rao signal the
boat for more tucker, and get as an apoctiser
with each new ration, twenty lashes for extrava-
gance. Now, Jones, the Grummet’s not big
enough fer you and me. We’ll toss up who "oes
over to the white fins. ” r . j,
Convict Jones demurred to this proposition, and
declined to submit his precious life to the hazard
ot the die. He put his objection into the shape
of a blow-. They grappled—wrestled—Borger Joe
knew a trick or two with his heels and threw Ids
teJlow-maroon on his back. And Jones’ back lav
on the two meal-bags, which, under the pressure
spurted out their contents over the rocky e<Go to
water-level. Very literally had they cast their
bread on the waters.
Convict Judsqn took his knees from his mate’s
chest, and Convict Jones arose, saving :
. “I’ll toss now. As well be "thrown to the
sharks or auged, as starve ’ere tor death or bo
hogged ter bits. iN-Ty curse on yer, Iforger JoeI J>
# * *
Joe prepared five smoothish pebbles. On
one side of each he marked, respectively, with the
point of another and sharpened stone :
X XX XXX xxxx xxxxx
“ Why don’ yer put Aggers ? Wot’ro puttin’
kisses fur ? ”
“They’ll do. ’Sides, we’ll both be kissed short'v
by Death.
“Yer funny,” said Jones.
“ Highest out of three throws kills,” suggested
Joe.
Jones nodded.
Jones took his cap and shook the stones together.
Draw,’ said he, “for first throw. Lowest ’as
it.”
Joe, looking over the sea, dipped his hand in
and drew the three. Jones drew the four.
Joe, with a murmur, clasped the five bits and
tossed them up. They fell, chinking,-three
marked, two blank ;5,1, 4 ; total, 10. His second
cast was (i; his last, four blanks and 1.
“Luck’s out,” he said, “You’ll beat that
17 easily. ”
“ Orter,” said Jones. But he threw 9 and 7
and then faltered, “ Sixteen, too ! ” Bor the first
time, lie quavered.
“You’ll throw four blanks—see if you dont ”
laughed Joe.
Hp the stones went propelled by a very shaking
hand. And, true enough, four blanks did fall.
But the faced stone was two. Eighteen !
“I’ve won, I’ve won ! ” he shouted.
“Yes,” rejoined Borger Joe, “the Devil gene-
rally looks after his own.”
* * #
Joe went into his cave. When he came
out again he had his Bible with him. “ I’ll be
ready in a few minutes, Bob.” And, seating him-
self calmly, he read a chapter.
“I’m ready, Jones,” ho said, when he closed
the Book. “Look, the white fins are waiting!”
He spoke the truth. Two vultures of the deep
were sheening their fins within musket-shot.
You re funking, Jones. I’ve no objection to
make it suicide just to oblige .you
And Jones, evidently disliking the privilege lie
had won, assenting mutely, Zorger Joe “ made
it.”
Nevertheless Captain Bankes hanged Convict
Robert Jones, No. 9439, Sussex. But it is doubt-
ful whether it was on suspicion of Judson’s murder
or for destroying two meal-bags. Most likely it
was the latter : Bankes once hanged a man for
flattening out a tin-pannikin.
* * *
The pilot crew caught a shark a few
months afterwards. There was no evidence that
the man’s jaw found in its interior was Joe’s, as
several other Children of the System had pre-
ferred the white-fins to the Grummet.

Bereaved.
lyet me come in where yon sit weeping—aye,
Let me, who have not any child to die,
Weep with you for the little one whose love
I have known nothing of.
The.little arms that slowly, slowly loosed
Their pressure round your neck—the hands you
used
To kiss. Such arms, such hands I never knew,
May I not weep with you ?
Fain would I be of service—say some thing
Between the tears that would be comforting,
But ah ! far sadder than yourselves am I,
Who have no child to die.
JAMES WHITCOME RILEY.
Christmas is over, and the tough, cold,
cheerless, ungainly Christmas fowl has ceased
from troubling for another year. Once every
twelve months there flits across the mental horizon
a species of spectral ostrich —a long, lank, leathern
bird, with blue legs covered with a shiny incrusta-
tion like smashed cockroaches, and a broken tail
that hangs down like the blown-up banner of a
defeated army ; and it is the purpose and business
t his torn and routed animal to diffuse peace on
earth in a general sort of way, and goodwill
towards men. lie is generally bought about a
fortnight before the day of execution, and in the
interval ho fasts and shrieks in the yard, and
gallops round in the vain search for a way of
escape. Every now and then the peaceful in-
habitant, lurking in the shadow of his hash-
fortress, is roused by a dissonant howl that
seems to come from the sink at the back of
the wash-house, or else there goes forth a
long and fear-cine cry like the crash of a
fading star, and in either case he knows that the
Christinas fowl is enjoying itself in its own gently
unobtrusive way, and is waiting for the great
change and the ensuing resurrection. At other
times he observes a glazed and filmy eye looking
gloomily out from the recesses of the ash-bucket,
an 1 a faded, tattered Pompadour comb shaking
in the breeze, and he recognises by these signs that
the fowl is prospering and. getting ready to be a
joyous and fragrant delicacy. In between its
other occupations the bird usually goes out and
hghts with the dogs and eats, and generally it
winds up, through the mercy of a beneficent
Providence, in being stolen by some passing
Chnihman, to whom it becomes a curse, a
tidh. and an eyesore, while its legitimate owner
is left to dine on blasphemy and cold ham.
Occasionally, however, the spectral songster re-
fuses to be embezzled and turns up in a cooked
condition on the table, and then the most reason-
able way to meet the difficulty is to stand with
one foot on a chair, and hold down the boiled and
stuffed incubus by putting the other hoof in the
plate, after which it is advisable to welt the
alleged victual with an adze. Por our own part,
wd spent several of our earlier years in the mining
industry,, and the experience which we then
acquired in blowing up rocks with dynamite, and
blasting tons'of hungry quartz, has done us good
service in our combats with more than one old and
hide-bound emblem of Christmas festivity. The
method of killing thisescaped albatross arc various;
one is to grasp him by the head and shake him
convulsive y in the air, and another, and an easier
device, is to guillotine the dejected article of food
—after which he usually escapes into the house
without his head, and rushes madly all over
the furniture, and is ultimately found with
his corpse jammed among the spoons. His busi-
ness, whim lie is dead, is to disseminate joyous
hilarity with his bones and his scaly legs,
and to implant the seeds of good fellowship
in the human soul and stamp them down with
his big, coarse feet; he is an indigestible object
that falls with a dull, sickening thud on the bright
lexicon of youth, and he rolls through the waste
places of cookery and gnashes his teeth as he
rolls, and even after he is eaten he leaves behind
him a memory of a huge blazing fowl that rushes
with a whizz and a hiss through a land of dreams.
He is no visible good in his deceased state, and he
is no good when he is not deceased except to dig
up largo areas of ground with his cumbrous hoofs,
and look for worms. Possibly he was meant as
firewood, and even viewed as building material ho
has many advantages, but somehow the world has
resolved to consider him in the light of an article
of diet, and it refuses to recognise how infamously
it has been deceived.
