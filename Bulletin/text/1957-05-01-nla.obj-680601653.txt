/''YV I.RI.OOKIXG the Vale of Clwyd, in north Wales, three miles
from Rhuddlan, is the cathedral city of St. Asaph. Although
it has a population of less than 2000, it has been elevated to the
status of “city” because of its possession of a cathedral—the smallest
in Britain.
At the monastery established there in the 6t-h century nearly a
thousand monks lived and studied. Amongst them was the boy,
Asaph, who was renowned for the healing miracles he performed, and
his influence was felt for miles around. His name is also perpetuated
m the spring, known as St. Asaph’s Well. He died in 59(5 and for
many years afterwards his fame attracted pilgrims to the monastery.
The cathedral, illustrated here, is only 182 feet long and 68 feet
wide (108 leet acioss the transepts), but is beautifully proportioned
and it possesses a massive central tower. The cathedral was destroyed
and rebuilt many times so that little remains of the Norman church.
It was destroyed in the border wars of 1282, and again in 1402 by
Owen ('lendowei, who laid the city and the church in ruins During
the Civil War, Parliamentarian troops used the church as a stable
and the choir as a manger. Repairs to the fabric were carried out
in the 17th and 18th centuries, and between the years 1869 and 1875
a thorough restoration was carried out by the famous architect Sir
Gilbert Scott.
St. Asaph is also associated with* Sir Henry Stanley, the explorer
who "found” Livingstone in Africa; he was educated at the local
workhouse between the years 1847 to 1856.

WORLD PRIZE STORIES
One of the inestimable advantages of
being Australian—so the Odhams
Press World Prize Stories reveals to
us—is that, alphabetically at least, our
writers have every chance of coming
first in the world; for here is this
packed anthology of 41 stories, drawn
from such outlandish places as the
Belgian Congo and Viet-Nam as well as
France, England and America, opening
with none other than Mr. D’Arcy
Niland . . . closely followed by A. V.
Piesse, V. Atherton and Leslie Meller,
whom one had hardly heard of since
his excellent novels “Quartet” and “A
Leaf of Laurel.”
And very well-placed, too, aestheti-
cally as well as alphabetically, is Mr.
Niland. His story is very much like a
piece out'of “The Shiralee,” the hard,
tough life of an outback woman from
childhood to old age; and if one
wishes that Mr. Niland would not do
these stories in the first-person, making
the woman say and think things she
never would really say and think, and
if sentimentality always seems to lurk
like a soft artesian swamp under the
sun-baked gibber-plains of his tough-
ness, it is still an admirable, a gripping
story by any standards and a particu-
larly good one by the standards which
have obviously governed the prize-
awards in this competition and the
selections for the anthology. In fact,
Mr. Niland has two asterisks against
him in the table-of-contents, mean-
ing that he took one of the four
second-prizes awarded (first-prize was
5000 dollars).
So, too, has the second of the Aus-
tralian contributions, A. V. Piesse’s
“No Medal for Mallory,” which is
about the anxieties of a commercial air-
pilot who, always afraid of a crash, has
to take-off when he is tired, rescue a
sick woman from an outback station
and fly back to his base in dusk and
dangerous smoke-haze. This again is
a good yarn of its kind: essentially a
man-of-action story.
V. Atherton’s “The Lizard Died,
Too” is an odd little item about a
schoolteacher who beats an aboriginal
child because he does, not understand
that the boy is trying to give him his pet
lizard in a gesture of sympathy and
affection, not merely playing with it in
the classroom ; whereupon the child,
after various conflicts of emotion,
beats the lizard. It is a no-hope-in-the-
outback story; not very convincing,
but intriguing. Mr. Meller’s “The
Fourth Cockatoo” is a study in morbid
psychology—about a man in hospital
who is haunted by chrysanthemums and
visitors who turn into cockatoos —
which leaves this reviewer more
puzzled than pleased.
While this alphabetical arrangement
thus displays the Australians with such
welcome prominence, it seems rather
unkind to the two New Zealanders
included, George Joseph and H. A.
Cutten, who have to wait for over
200 pages until Finland, Iceland, India,
Israel, Jamaica, Madagascar and all
sorts of improbable places have been
disposed of.
Mr. Joseph writes about a Maori
who had enlisted for the Korean war
and, on his return, has to justify himself
to his aged relatives for neglecting the
farm and taking part in a “pakeha-war”
of no interest to his people. He
manages to persuade them, in effect,
not —as might be more convincing in a
Maori —that he went to war for the
adventure of it but that it is a noble
deed for Maoris to fight for victims of
aggression. The theme hardly makes
sense applied to a people with such
aggressive traditions as the Maoris,
but the setting and people live in spite
of it. An interesting point in it is that
Mr. Joseph says that the Maoris and
Koreans have several words in
common: “uto,” “tapu,” “mana” and
“pai.”
Neither of the New Zealand stories
has, alas, any prize-winning asterisks ;
only faintly irritating ones to explain
that the kowhai and the pohutukawa
are trees. But Mr. Cutten in his “Joint
Account” might well, in this company
of action-stories, have collected a prize,
for he has two gum-diggers, high up a
kauri-tree, who are in love with the
same girl and, in that perilous situation.
have-at each other with tomahawks ...
a very nicely-imagined piece of derring-
do.
The Japanese story which shared a
first-prize with “My Brother, My
Brother” by Norah Burke (U.K.) makes
clear, if these Antipodean examples
have not already done so, the principles
on which the prizes have been awarded.
They have gone to action; to the
bizarre; to the allure of remote
geography ; to the concept—and not
a bad one, either, though there can be
other considerations —that a story is a
piece of writing in which something
happens. The Japanese story (“Mother
and Son” by Juran Hisao) is about a
problem-child who is leading a double-
life ; a model at school but—
“l see that his conduct-marks are
given as one-hundred,” said the
policewoman, glancing at her papers,
“but I wonder if you know that,
apart from the present case, we’ve
received reports about the boy that
do not confirm a perfect conduct-
record? On the night of the third
of May, for example, the boy dressed
up as a girl—a sailor-dress with a red
neckerchief —and sold flowers in the
Ginza. In this district he’s stood at
the entrance to the camp with a taxi,
waiting for soldiers en route for
Korea to take them to Tokyo—
acting just like a pimp. Then lately
he was found staggering about dead
drunk . .
The boy has been (inefficiently)
.strangled by his mother at the time
when “over thirty-thousand Japanese
civilians committed suicide, believing
that the Americans would kill them
anyway. Parents and children threw
hand-grenades at each other. Others
leapt hand-in-hand from the cliffs into
the sea.” It is the most bizarre of all
the stories and so—first-prize. Mr.
Niland or Mr. Cutten could hardly
hope to be able to compete with that.
In spite of a long foreword by
C. Patrick Thompson, in a strange,
mechanical style, as if he had
swallowed a typewriter, it is rather diffi-
cult to discover exactly who or what
awards these prizes. It is done
by “an international co-operative
enterprise” which is represented
in each country by “an influen-
tial newspaper or magazine” and it has
the blessing of Unesco as likely to be
“fruitful in increasing national under-
standing between peoples.” At any
rate it makes a most rewarding book
for readers of action-stories. The 41
here printed were selected out of
100,000 stories “considered.”

ON THE RED ROAD
THE brawl between Mr. Gair und his
adversaries in Queensland is revela-
tionary when viewed as a develop-
ment in “Parliamentary” government.
The issue .isn’t between Mr. Gair
and his would-be executioners but
between the “Labor” party as a whole
and the people of Australia. Among
the guilty men involved. Mr. Gair
is as guilty as, or more guilty than, the
rest, because he is, in effect, an elected
trustee of the rights of the electors to
govern, and he has fostered a
condition of affairs for many years in
which contempt and intimidation of
Parliament have been not only
condoned but encouraged.
In Queensland, the British system of
government does not rule. The Theo-
dores and the Bukowskis and the
Schmellas seem gradually to have
introduced the traditional Polish or
Bulgarian or Rumanian system of
legislatures in which the House is
merely the instrument of some out-
side force, though it operates under the
false pretence that it is a freely elected
Parliament.
It was bad enough in the period of
Ryan and Theodore, which began five
or six years after the famous night on
which William Kidston greeted, in the
rich accents of Falkirk, a decision to
dissolve Parliament with an agonised
shout of “The Tsar has spoken! The
Duma is dissolved!”
Queensland Parliament has, by
imperceptible stages, reached a
condition in which it is no longer even
a Duma; it is a Supreme Soviet which
no more matters than the Supreme
Soviet of the U.S.S.R., and which
needs only a few more changes to
become exactly like the Kremlin
prototype of “Democratic Socialist”
legislatures.
There certainly is an election on a
universal roll. There is compulsory
voting; but there is the kind of
distribution of electorates which has
been imposed by the Russi an
conquerors and their agents on
Eastern European satellite countries
in which one party rules permanently,
is in office irrevocably, and other
parties are allowed to exist only as
window-dressing to deceive critics.
What is not yet realised about the
Queensland electoral position is that
it is not only perpetually destroying
the enemies of Labor and assuring
permanent office for the Labor party,
but it is ruthlessly destroying the party
system.
Liberalism, under the crushing
burden of discouragement imposed on
it by fighting hopeless fights in which
it can no more win electorally than a
show-visitor can come home with the
thimble and pea, must eventually
wither—would have withered now if it
had not been that in the Federal
elections it is often in the ascendant,
while perforce suffering a debacle in
Gair-run “elections.”
With the same principles applied in
the Federal sphere as in the North—
and Mr. Calwell has promised that they
will be, apart from the fact that
Federalised unions are mostly involved
in the political machine which gives
the Queensland Government its orders
—the whole .of Parliamentary govern-
ment would soon be on its way out
over the whole Commonwealth. The
various States, as they acquired Labor
Governments, would outvie the Eyatts
and the Calwells in their measures to
see that “Labor next time it is
elected will never again be defeated.”
The spectacle presented politically
by Queensland would be horrifying
in the British Isles. There, whatever
party is in office, the basic principle is
adhered to that Parliament is the repre-
sentative of the majesty and power of
the people, maintained by free voting
and by the exercise of the authority of
Parliament as a supreme court to
chastise those who interfere with its
proceedings.
Maintained, too, is the principle that
these rights are exercisable through any
personal privilege conferred on
members because of their election as
M.P.s or because they have any special
status; but because they are the
embodiment of the people’s authority,
the custodians of the people’s power.
The real freedom of action is reserved
to the people themselves, so long as
they do not interfere with the dignity
or exercise of Parliament’s powers,
deeded by themselves to be exercised
by the legislature.
Britons even balk at the idea of com-
pulsory voting because they still are
under the impression that to force
an elector to vote for one or half a
dozen people all of whom he disagrees
with violently or considers scoundrels
is an infraction of man’s natural liberty.
In Queensland now, government is
a matter between the Cabinet, a sort
of politbureau, and the union
Trades Hall junta and the Q.C.E.—
analogous respectively to the Central
Committee of the Communist Party
and the Politbureau in Russia, both
in nature and in mutual relationship.
The juntas give their orders, though
there are sometimes chaotic differences.
They accompany them with threats to
the Government and Parliament, made
openly and cynically, which any self-
respecting Government and Parliament
would resent by using Parliament’s
powers and privileges against them.
Ministers, even the Premier, condone
the existence of these unconstitutional
pressure-groups by accepting member-
ship of them and taking part in their
debates. •-
The manner in which the “Labor”
movement dealt with? Mr. Foley,
Minister for Lands, after he had been
found guilty, by a commissioner of
corrupt practice in his Ministerial office,
and the contrasting manner in which
it dealt with the high civil servant
who opposed and exposed his proceed-
ings, show the moral background
against which Queensland is governed.
And the tortuous manoeuvres which
marked the battle raging round the
extraordinary legislature concerned
with the Motor Spirit Bill and appoint-
ments to the University staff illustrate
the whittling-away of the power of the
legislature and how much the Govern-
ment is dependent on the approval or
disapproval of political gangsters and
union commissars Outside the House.
The Premier even has to manoeuvre
in order to be able to call his own
Parliamentary Caucus together
“legally” within the party rules—
though not. of course, the Parlia-
mentary rules, which do not matter
in practice.
Queensland has come to the stage
at which it accepts the frightening
picture of advancing Communist
government with listless indifference.
The Gair-Junta fight represents
trends which the Federal Constitutional
Commission now sitting might well
debate intensively. Even if that merely
brought the Labor members of the
commission into the open, it would
serve- a useful purpose. And if the
commission does not deal with the
matter Federal Parliament should
debate it thoroughly when the com-
mission’s report comes up for review.
Australia is swiftly drifting, through
the Labor policy, towards a
dictatorship in which no party opposed
to Labor will ever have a hope of using
influence, much less achieving office.
Once the condition is firmly established
in one State it will spread to the others
in due course.


NORTH OF TWENTY-EIGHT


PLAIN ENGLISH
Always Australian
In a world full of doubt and surrender,
and which now seems to be run by the
United States and Russia, according to
whichever has the momentary vantage-
point, Mr. Menzies stands out as a man
who is not afraid to speak his mind and
who is able to make his meaning clear.
A lot of matters have been clarified
during his journey through Asia, made
at an opportune time with Japan now a
member of the United Nations and the
fight really about to begin to decide
whether the Japanese will merge into
Asia or remain in the Western bloc, with
which they are now closely allied and
integrated as to defence and trade.
At a time when the United States, alias
the United Nations, has decided to allow
Egypt to break its international agree-
ments tentatively and have its own way
with the Suez Canal —Russia going further
and wishing to. make the lawlessness
permanent —it was salutary to hear a
forthright declaration from the Prime
Minister on New Guinea soil about the
future of the territories there.
Hitherto Prime Ministers and others
have been cautious in this matter. Indeed,
the Chifley-Evatt Government embar-
rassed future Governments by first of all
declaring for the trust system of control
of ex-mandated territories and then
making the extraordinary decision to
integrate the Governments of Papua,
which is'Australian soil, and New Guinea,
which is a United Nations trust. Dr.
Evatt, in particular, would have given
Australia away with a packet of tea if
the United Nations had told him to do
it. The emphasis was on U.N.
Mr. Menzies has issued a declaration
to the world (including Indonesia) that
“the integrity of Dutch New Guinea is
vital to Australia.” He has said more
clearly than has been said before that
our own section of the island and its
surrounding archipelagoes, which have the
makings of a rich State of'considerably
more importance than, say, Colombia or
Cuba, are our responsibility, to be run
by Australia and not by “enterprising
gentlemen.... 10,000 miles away... .who
try to tell us what to do with New Guinea
... .though... .we are doing a much
better job than any of the nations criti-
cising us.”
This is not original, but his statement
that “we do not regard our presence here
as temporary” went further than has
been said before.
It is a pity that Australia cannot
assume the government of the shield of
islands, British-held, off the north-east
coast out past the Solomons. From the
point of view of defence geography they
now belong to Australia and are vital to
its security.
Victoria's Anzac Day
[From “Colliuti Street”]
Anzac Day was commemorated in Vic-
toria according to tradition, with all
places of good cheer closed all day and
night, and, unfortunately, entirely out
of key with the rest of the nation. This
despite the uplifting dawn service and the
splendid march.
Since 1936 the few elderly men who
hold the power in the Victorian R.S.L.
have been able to block all efforts to hold
a plebiscite among members and have
successfully held out despite the argu-
ment that has followed, and the new
generation ef returned soldiers, now
middle-aged themselves, have never been
given an opportunity to vote for a
changed form of observance.
There are 17 other ex-Service associa-
tions in Victoria, and the chief of these
have publicly and strongly sought a
change. Public-opinion polls show Vic-
toria one of the most eager States for a
Saturday-type observance, with services
in the morning and entertainment in the
afternoon and night.
It has never been possible to obtain a
satisfactory guide to the feelings of the
R.S.L. membership, since its delegates to
conference are in many cases elected at
sparsely-attended meetings, and the great
majority are retired men with settled
personal opinions and ample leisure to
attend conferences.
Returned Servicemen of all associations
are entitled to have their views considered
by the Bolte Government.
China Trade
The Commonwealth Minister for Com-
merce is giving some encouragement to
trade with Red China. The position in
the past has largely been dictated by
considerations arising partly out of the
Korean war and partly out of the fact
that the United Nations continues to
refuse to recognise that any China exists
but that of Chiang Kai-shek. The
U.N. therefore has been much in
the position of the Indian legis-
lature which is supposed to have
passed an Act declaring the elephant
to be a myih.
Red China exists as a formidable fact
of nature. There is little hope that it will
cease to be a fact of nature. It is some-
thing the world has to live with.
Its policies are, of course, ominous and
threatening, and tied-up with those of
Russia, with which it is concerned in the
promised world revolution. At the same
time, a starving wild beast is not made
more tractable by putting it in a cage on
short rations and refusing to treat it
as other than an outcast.
The British policy has been pretty
sensible from the first, because the British
have had a lot of experience with the
Chinese and have found themselves able
to handle them when ®ther people have
failed.
The outcome hasn’t always been en-
couraging, but they have persisted.
Lately there has been a gradual
weakening of the trade-embargo walls.
Mr. McEwen mentioned last week the
“useful and expanding trade” with Red
China, which we are supplying with wool-
tops and agricultural machinery apart
from some other products for which there
is a growing Chinese market. The
Chinese are selling us tea and tung-oil and
putting out feelers about other lines.
The tendency is not native to Australia.
The trend among the 14 nations con-
cerned in a virtual blockade of China
has been such that the United States has
been forced to issue a statement in which
it declares that “we have been, and are,
unwilling to agree to any relaxation
which would result in an increased flow
of strategic goods to Communist China
....The United States will continue its
unilateral embargo on all trade with
Communist China.” But it has conceded
that, in order to meet the views of its
allies, it would “consider removing some
non-strategic items from the special
China list and placing them or the same
basis as goods of the same type exported
to countries of the European Soviet
bloc."
From a political viewpoint there is
much to be said for development of trade
with China, especially since it seems that
the Russians, for all their bold promises
and boasts, have not been able to help
the Chinese very much in their shortages.
"Rules" Advance-bookings
[By “Bookie’s D«g"]
For years the Victorian Football League
has pleaded with the trustees of the Mel-
bourne Cricket Ground to permit advance-
bookings of most of the accommodation
at the big stadium for the league’s final
matches. The utmost concession the
league had been able to wring from the
trustees had been a small block of seats
in the old stand that was demolished to
make way for the new Olympic building.
Sternest opponent of wholesale book-
ing was Arthur Calwell, who is chairman
of the trustees. By some involved process
of ratiocination, Arthur had always con-
tended that advance-bookings were not in
the best interest of the “workers.”
Now the trustees, Arthur included,
have turned a complete somersault; a
gymnastic feat no doubt inspired by the
successful booking-arrangements for the
Olympic Games, in future the whole of
the ground’s accommodation, standing-
room included, will be sold by advance-
booking. There will be no tickets what-
ever on sale at the gates.
The new arrangements will meet with
general approval; but there will be some
to regret the passing of the old “first
come, first served” system. Saddest will
be teenagers of both sexes who regarded
the old queueing system as a grand
excuse to stop out all night. In the past
their antics have provided a lot of fun
for themselves, and good copy for the
newspapers. They must have been pretty
tired by the time the ball was bounced.
Apparently they spent most of the nights
of their vigils jitterbugging,, singing to
the accompaniment of mouth-organs
and piano-accordions, and cooking over
portable barbecue stoves.
Radio-station 3AW is probably not
happy about the change. On the morning
of each final match that station used to


broadcast its breakfast-session from the
outskirts of the ground. And the manu-
facturers of a well-known brand of
tinned foods have lost a source of good
public-relations. They used to provide
a free soup-kitchen for the all-night
queuers.
No doubt the scalpers who waxed fat
on the Games are happy about the
change. If the trustees can devise a plan
to thwart blackmarketing of the tickets
they will earn the gratitude of most
citizens. The activities of the scalpers
were one of the few unpleasant sidelights
of the Games.
Menzies At Best
[From Canberra]
At 62, and with nearly 10 years in the
nation’s top political post behind him,
Robert Gordon Menzies is undoubtedly
Australia’s most outstanding figure of the
last decade.
Certainly he has not won the senti-
mental attachment that Chifley and
Curtin gained. But most fair-minded
critics do agree that Menzies has integrity,
charm, persuasiveness, and a gift for
oratory unsurpassed in Western political
circles except by Churchill at his prime.
It is these characteristics that have
enabled him to return to Australia
triumphant (if tired) after a Far East tour
in which he successfully wooed three
northern neighbors and raised Australia’s
prestige in South-east Aasia to record
post-war heights.
The fruits of his mission—mutual
trust, friendship, increased trade —can
only be destroyed if Dr. Evatt is unwise
enough to accept an invitation to visit
Red China later this year. A decision
to trade, with Red China is one thing, but
for our alternative Prime Minister —and
that’s what Dr. Evatt is—to pay a social
call would be regarded as a breach of
faith by all Free Asia.
Within a few weeks of his return,
Menzies will be off again, this time to
London.
Already the most-travelled Prime
Minister in Australia’s history, Menzies
will leave towards the end of this month
for the Prime Ministers’ conference,
due to start on June 26. This time he
will be away for at least six weeks, and,
as his absence will coincide with the
winter recess of Federal Parliament, he
would be foolish not to make a leisurely
sea-trip of it in time to reach London
a few days before the conference opens.
Naturally, Labor will attack him if he
does go by sea, but this is to be expected
as fair criticism by present-day standards.
There is no valid reason w;hy Mr.
Menzies should spend more time at home
when he is at his best representing us
overseas. And surely more now than
ever before the voice of a Commonwealth
Elder Statesman —and that’s how Menzies
is regarded at Whitehall —is needed to
reunite a squabbling Commonwealth
family of nations.
But while he is away some recognition
should be paid to his “locum” —Sir
Arthur Fadden, only a few months his
junior in age and just as hard-working in
the national interest.
As well as being Treasurer for a record
term, Fadden can beat all others hollow
for the Acting Prime Ministership. He’s
been acting P.M. for a total of 15 months
since the Menzies-Fadden coalition Gov-
ernment took office in December, 1949.
On Fadden’s shoulders rest the host
of problems which invariably crop up
when the “Big Bloke” is away.
Menzies would be the first to admit
that his deputy’s handling of the nation’s
affairs during these times is nothing short
of dextrous.
Apex
Casey’s speech at Ballarat on the
division in Australia in religion, politics
and State pride was probably the first
worth-while publicity the quiet workers
for the Apex Clubs throughout Australia
had received in their 26 years of energetic
existence.
It was also a well-earned tribute for
the Minister for External Affairs to
choose the club, which rides over, as he
said, religious, political and State
boundaries, to deliver his plea for
national cohesion.
Apex was first formed at Geelong in
1931, when its protagonists made the
simple pledge of serving the community.
There are now 160 clubs throughout
Australia, with 6000 members, and 115
of them were represented at the national
convention of the Association of Apex
Clubs at Ballarat by 1000 members. A
delegate came from the Singapore Apex
Club.
The network of clubs serve their com-
munities quietly and practically by such
unpublicised deeds as collecting and
supplying books to the sick, giving
assistance to the bereft and needy,
sponsoring migrants and showing films in
hospitals.
It was Apex which brought about the
recent inquiry in Victoria into the plight
of the aborigine (and the subsequent
Parliamentary bill), by pointing out, with
first-hand evidence, that the natives at
Lake Tyers lived in more unhappy condi-
tions than did their grandparents 50
years ago, and also by blandly asking if
it would not be possible to improve their
status if some white Australians under-
took to sponsor black Australian- families.
Apex goes about its daily chores,
practising by its service to the community
what more vociferous sections merely
preach.
Victorian Labor Dusts-of?
Faced with the reasonable certainty of
defeat at the next State elections,
Victorian Labor is now proposing a face-
lift, chiefly on housing, but changes in
policy on tenancy, municipal government,
health and social service will also be
adopted to refurbish Labor appeal to the
electorate.
The housing “changes” proposed are
based on low deposits, low interest-rates
and long periods of repayment; but this
has been the policy of all Governments
since the end of the war, including Labor
Governments and, more importantly, of
the current L.C.P. Government in
Victoria.
Horace Petty, the Housing Minister,
has had some success with his administra-
tive acts and changes of policy, aimed
at helping those who helped themselves,
and naturally has incurred the displeasure
of the Opposition and aroused its alarm.
Complete success has, of course, eluded
him. In a State which is absorbing so
great a proportion of migrants as Victoria
a period perhaps as long as a decade may
be necessary before housing may be
adequate for the needs of the population.
It is therefore vital for Labor to present
a policy that at least looks new, especially
against a Government that has retained
remarkably its popularity not merely by
its obvious sincerity but also by its acts.
The men leading Labor in Victoria,
politically and industrially, are aged. It
is to their credit as old campaigners that
they recognise the political outlook and
the need for an attractive platform to be
adopted at the June State conference ;
but what has been proposed so far bear*
the same old mark of bowyangs.
The Cat's Away
[From Canberra]
If the Master had been home, would the
entire Cabinet h;ave deserted him on the
day of an important investiture at Govern-
ment House?
Of course not! Several Ministers
would have been on call, cap in hand!
The spectacle of Sir Arthur Fadden
unattended by even one junior Minister
recalls: “When the cat’s away, the mice
will play.”
On the day of the investiture, the
Ministers’ Movements list shows that all
Ministers were absent from the national
capital: some were travelling on official
business, others were at home.
If Menzies had been here he would
have been assured of a suitable entourage
—and rightly so —to accompany him to
Yarralumla to vyatch the Governor-
General confer the accolade on six Aus-
tralians knighted by the Queen in the New
Year honors list.
Surely one of the three Service
Ministers —Cramer (Army), Davidson
(Navy) or Osborne (Air)—could have
spared time to put in an appearance?
After all, Vice-Admiral Sir Roy
Dowling, First Naval Member, and
George-medallist Duntroon Cadets Ford
and Gosling were among the 21
distinguished people invested.
The Prime Minister wouldn’t have been
happy to see the rest of the record, either.
It shows that not one member of the 21-
man Ministry was in Canberra for the
three days preceding the investiture. On
the day of the ceremony Sir Arthur was
the only Minister “on deck” in the
capital.
Is it too much to ask that at least one
Minister remain on duty at the seat of
government at all times? Mr. Menzies,
some years ago, issued an edict to this
effect, but scant notice was taken of it
during his latest absence overseas.


Society
"AND IT'S PRINTED

TT was a hot afternoon when one’s
thoughts turn to iced beer, electric-
fa ns and insect-spray, and I
wasn’t surprised when a New Australian
came in and said: “You have the fly-
paper, yes?” I assured him “No,” and
directed him next door to the general store
to which my P.O. is attached. In no
time at all he was back again, shaking his
head ; he placed an envelope already
stamped for postage on the counter;
extended his arms horizontally and moved
tnem slowly up and down, while he
inquired, “Fly? No?” This time I
assured him “Yes,” and put an air-
mail label on his letter. —“First Post.”

years ago I was told of a young Mormon
girl on the “Deseret News” (the deseret is
a flower of arid areas), which employs
only members of the faith. She went one
morning to a cafe near the office, ordered
coffee, and lit a .cigarette. An elderly
woman sitting opposite launched into a
tirade against any Mormon smoking and
drugging herself with “habit-forming
coffee.” “Sooner than smoke or drink
coffee,” she almost shrieked, “I’d —I’d
commit adultery!” The
girl raised a languid
eyebrow. “I’d rather,
too,” she remarked, “but
they only give me ten

Christchurch, N.Z. “A

me,” he says, “and
showed me a caricature
of the late Joseph Ward.
It was a clever job of
a man hard to draw, and
I took it in to the boss.
The boss thought it was
pretty good, and he
allowed me to offer the
boy 10s. a week for a
drawing. That’s how
David Low started. A bit later
we raised him to a quid a week,
and he got another quid for a drawing
for a politician known as ‘Rickety’
Russell, who was bringing out a weekly
rag called ‘The Spectator.’ It wasn’t a
very good paper; it came out on Satur-

A Democrat on the Qanges
By MANNING CLARK
EVERYONE in the Uni-
versity Labor Club
agreed that Jack and Val
Howell were “naturals”
to send on a goodwill mission
to the students of India.
“Let’s drink,” the president
of the club said in his fare-
well speech, “to a couple of
decent democrats, two
crusaders of goodwill, two
people who have been behind
every good and progressive
movement at the Shop for the
past five years. Let’s drink to
two good mates, Jack and Val
Howell.”
And that is what they were
-—decent democrats, crusaders
of goodwill, and good mates.
Jack had learnt the truth about
life in the sociology classes in
Melbourne. He was a man
who stood for something, a
man who knew how to make
people better. Not that he was
& goody-goody, or sloppy, or
unctuous. He sucked all day
at his huge cherrywood, some-
times asking his friends:
“Do you think I could
scrounge a fill of ’baccy,
mate?”
Everyone liked Val, too ; she
had what old-fashioned people
called “a sweet nature.” What
Howell liked about her was her
great big eyes, and her habit of
closing them whenever she
said: “As you say, Jack, what
this country needs is a few
decent democrats.”
So when the Club was asked
to nominate two people to go
to India everyone thought:
Who else could it be but Jack
and Val?
They were just as popular on
the boat from Melbourne to
Bombay, where Jack was a
“natural” for president of the
deck-sports committee, and
Val a very good secretary.
Bombay and Delhi, however,
were a bit of a shock. It was
all far more expensive than
they had expected. Besides, as
Jack put it, they found it hard
to get on the right side of the
students they. met.
“I can’t take a trick with
these people, Val.” What
Howell meant was that they
looked puzzled or unimpressed
when he told them about “the
Aussie ideal of being mates.”
Howell was a man who
needed a programme, needed
to be doing things. So after a
few gloomy, moody days in
Delhi he “nutted out a
schedule.”
“Look here, Val,” he said,
“we may as well have a geek
at everything while we’re here.
Why not stop off for a night at
Benares on the trip from Delhi
to Calcutta, and see the sights
on Mother Ganges . . . see the
burning-ghats, before decent
education and decent condi-
tions give these people an adult
attitude to death?”
“That would be wonderful
dear, if . . . only promise not to
be cross with me if I say it . . .
now, promise?”
“Of course I promise.”
“Do you think we can afford
it, dear? I’ve already had to
ask my father_for more money,
and we haven’t half-finished
the trip.”
Howell took the cherrywood
out of his mouth, and pointed
it at his wife. “Now look here,
dear”
TWO days later Howell and
Val arrived at the Old
Delhi station, and found the
first-class compartment reserved
for them. In one hand
Howell was carrying his
cherrywood. When he wasn’t
sucking it he found it helped
to give weight to his conversa-
tion.
Under his other arm he was
carrying his reading-matter for
the journey, a pamphlet on
“The Role of the Social
Sciences in Underdeveloped
Areas” by a reader in sociology
at the National University in
Canberra. He was still puzzl-
ing why some of the students
in Delhi found the title offen-
sive—“ Rum people, these. You
show them the know-how, and
they take it from you, but
instead of being grateful, they
resent it.”
A minute, or so after they sat
down the first hawker arrived
with a tray of brightly-painted
home-made toys. Howell
thanked him politely for call-
ing, then asked him to leave.
The man pretended not to
understand: “Sahib buy toys
for children?”
Howell spoke slowly and
deliberately, spacing his
words: “We like your toys ;
we think they are very good,
but we don’t need them.” Then
he smiled —what he called his
smile of “democratic benevol-
ence.” Still the man did not
budge. So Howell tried his
brotherhood-of-man gesture:
he put his arm round the man’s
shoulders, thumped him
warmly on the back, and
laughed what he hoped was a
democratic laugh, full of good-
will and fraternal sentiments,
but each thump also had in it
a faint suggestion of a shove,
which, to his disappointment,
only made the hawker dig his
heels in. Also, and this
bothered him more, the man
did not laugh in return, so that
the last of Howell’s laughs
faded into a few nervous
er-ars ; then dead silence, which
the hawker broke by saying in
broken English:
“You rich man, Sahib ... I
poor man. Sahib ' buy toys
from me.”
T>Y Agra they had bought so
many extras that Val sug-
gested perhaps they had better
buy another bag in Benares —■
a really big bag, big enough to
hold what she called the
present takings and anything
they picked up between Benares
and Calcutta.
“And while we are talking of
bags, dear,” she went on, “do
you think you’ll be able to
manage to carry our big bag
from the train to the bus at
Benares?”
Howell looked at his wife
long and patiently. “I have

On the very day that South Australia
was celebrating its centenary of respon-
sible government the Labor party in
Queensland was demonstrating its con-
tempt for the institution by expelling a
Premier for refusing to accept dictation
from an irresponsible body outside
Parliament.

Tommy White, former High Commis-
sioner in London, wants to see a fact-
finding committee appointed to “sort
out the tangled percentages” of migration.
He’s referring to conflicting statements on
the relative proportions of British and
Southern European migrants in the last
year or so. He claims that the proportion
of British migrants is dwindling at the
very time when there is in Britain a record
waiting-list of would-be migrants.

Two Brisbane brick companies have
cut their prices by Is. a thousand as a
direct result of the latest fall in the State
basic wage. That’s a good example.
Who’s following it?
• •
Fadden has asked manufacturers to
discuss with him their arguments for
removal of sales-tax anomalies and for
general sales-tax cuts.
This is no unprecedented course ; it’s a
shrewd move by an astute Treasurer who
wants to prevent an influential section of
the community from saying it had no
chance to put its views to the Government
before the framing of the Budget.
Right on the heels of the offer, the
Associated Chambers of Manufactures
are organising industry on the question
and will lead a representative deputation
to the Treasurer within the next few
weeks —well before Cabinet sits down to
its pre-Budget talks in July.

At the centenary celebrations of the
South Australian Parliament last Wednes-
day the U.K. High Commissioner, Lord
Carrington, presented on behalf of the
British Parliament a gilt-on-silver mace
and unveiled a commemorative plaque
incorporating representatfons of the
present Parliament House and the one of
1857, together with the names of the
Premiers, Presidents of the Legislative
Council and Speakers of the House of
Assembly in 1857 and 1957. An interest-
ing feature of the plaque is that it was
designed by the Deputy-Opposition-leader
in the Legislative Council, K. E. Bar-
dolph, who is an architect.
Three former Premiers of South Aus-
tralia were present at the centenary
celebrations—Sir Richard Butler (1927-30
and 1933-38), Playford’s Liberal pre-
decessor ; L. L. Hill, who led two Labor
Ministries (1926-27 and 1930-33); R. S.
Richards, later Administrator of Nauru,
who headed a Labor Government for
two months in 1933.

Harry Pollitt’s executive of the British
Communist party had been telling its
followers that only a handful of members
had left the party over Russian inter-
ference in Hungary, but at the party’s
congress this week it came out that 7000
had resigned. This led one disillusioned
rank-and-filer to comment that a few
more handfuls like that and there'd be
no party left.
• •
Qantas may soon have flights girdling
the globe if Civil Aviation Director-
General D. G. Anderson’s Washington
visit in May is successful. Government
officials hope that Anderson will persuade
the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Authority to
grant Qantas the right to fly across the
United States.
Qantas Pacific services at present
terminate at San Francisco, so that the
Australian company cannot book
passengers to London via the U.S. with-
out calling on the services of a U.S.
domestic airline.
A factor which should strengthen the
Australian case is that Qantas uses
American planes and has currently placed
an order for seven Boeing 707 jet air-
liners at a cost of £lB.B million. In
addition, the Government believes it has
been more than generous in its treat-
ment here of Pan-American Airways.

William Thomas Ely, who died in
Sydney last week at 87, was Lang’s
Minister for Health when the Big Fella
fell in May, 1932. Earlier he'd been
Assistant Minister for Labor and
Industry. Ely was in the N. S. Wales
Assembly for nine years, representing
Parramatta in two Parliaments and
Granville in two.

For 37 years royalties on timber taken
from N. S. Wales Crown leases have been
apportioned on the basis of one-third
to the leaseholder and two-thirds to the
Forestry Department. Just before
Easter the regulation was amended to
reduce the leaseholder’s share to a
twentieth. Debating the drastic change,
Country-party leader Bruxner said a First
War Digger had written to him telling
how he had carefully husbanded timber
on his property for more than 20 years,
now to find that the cut in his royalties
would make his past conservation work
a waste of time and expenditure. Bruxner
asked the Government to reconsider the
new regulation, but there was nothing
doing.
“Ex-ACT”: Most listeners to Parlia-
mentary broadcasts are inarticulate (per-
haps they’re left speechless), whereas the
critics of the sessions, mostly lovers of
highbrow music and similar programmes,
are highly and indignantly vocal. I’ve
heard a lot of dehates in the flesh, and
admit that even with the added attraction
of being able to see the speakers, the pro-
ceedings can get pretty boring. Broad-
casting is a lot to blame, because the
Whips try to make every member speak
for the full allotment of time permitted
under Standing Orders. I think an
alteration of the Standing Orders is the
most urgent task. Perhaps the Leader of
the House, Harold Holt, who is doing a
good job in sprucing-up procedure, will
take a look at the possibility of some
amendments designed to streamline
obsolete methods of dealing with some
of the legislation, so that listeners (and,
later-on, TV-viewers) will get more
pleasure and more profit out of the
broadcasts.

Professor Hyman Levy, who told the
British Communist party some home-
truths before resigning from it at the
annual congress last week, said that on a
recent visit to Russia he “got a bellyful
that will last me for the rest of my
life.” He has been a member for many
years in the course of which he must have
stomached quite a lot of unpalatable
provender, but apparently there comes a
- time when even the most seasoned Com-
munist belly revolts at the stuff it is
asked to swallow.
• •
“Moorapi”: The spectacle of Liberal
member Kane moving stealthily on all-
fours across the floor of Vic. Legislative
Assembly was too good an opportunity
to be missed by Opposition-leader Cain.
Having found himself still seated in the
Opposition benches talking to a friend
in the enemy camp after a division had
been called, Kane had just passed the
end of the table on the home crawl when
Cain put the show away. An order from
the Speaker sent him back to vote with
Labor.

S.A. Department of Agriculture spent
£172,000 in 1955-56 fighting a grass-
hopper plague rated the worst in the
history of the State. It claims the money
was well spent and saved S.A. more
than £lO million.

Considerable improvement of weather-
forecasting is likely when the Bureau of
Meteorology puts into operation soon an
intensified programme of upper-air
observations. The bureau is going to
double the frequency of upper-air obser-
vations over its network of more than
twenty radar- and radio-equipped observ-
ing-stations. It will use Special high-
altitude balloons to secure data on wind,
temperature and humidity at levels up to
100,000 feet. But it’s expected that we’ll
still get the kind of weather we usually
suffer.


In Brisbane the two Labor factions
are getting their clothes-hoists ready and
preparing to hang out their dirty linen
without even troubling to wash it.
Premier Gair’s expulsion from the party
went through last Wednesday according
to plan despite the fact that he was able
to tell the Q.C.E. that he had the support
of nine out of his 10 Ministers —Deputy-
Premier Duggan the only dissentient —-
and 26 of the 47 members of caucus.
Big Boss Bukowski had indicated earlier
that he didn’t consider the opinions of
Cabinet or caucus had anything to do
with the case. Voting was rather close —
35-30. Gair himself was asked to leave
the meeting before the vote was taken.
After hearing the verdict Gair said he
had no intention Of resigning the Premier-
ship. He was still leader of the majority
party in Parliament and would carry on
until challenged in Parliament. The
Assembly is in recess and ordinarily
would not be called together until August.
On Friday a meeting of the Labor
members who had previously supported
Gair, plus Foley (expelled over the
Lands Commission findings) and Gardner
(under suspension), decided to stick with
Gair, and to boycott a meeting of caucus
members called by the Q.C.E. for
Monday. On the radio Gair hinted at the
possibility of introducing court-con-
trolled ballots for trade-union elections —-
a slap at the A.W.U.
There was talk of Federal intervention
if Gair would provide the opportunity
by appealing against the decision. Gair
declined to oblige, and a telegraphic vote
of the Federal executive of the A.L.P.
turned-down intervention by 8 votes to 4.
At the weekend Q.C.E. men were talk-
ing of royal commissions on beer, films
and prices, and publishing large advertise-
ments listing Gair’s alleged misdeeds;
Treasurer Walsh was threatening to drop
a bombshell —manufactured by the late
A.W.U. chief Clarrie Fallon —on Bukow-
ski ; Gair was saying that his expulsion
had been ordered by the oil interests;
and Duggan was making radio attacks
on his chief, preparatory to resigning
the Deputy-Premiership. Outside Parlia-
ment House the branches of the trees
were bending under the weight of over-
fed chickens coming home to roost.
• •
Queensland Opposition parties are
holding a joint meeting tomorrow to
discuss developments. On statements so
far made the Libs, seem likely to urge
opposition to both Gair and official Labor
and to press for an early election. The
Country party is not so sure; Nicklin
has spoken of supporting a Gair Govern-
ment “in certain circumstances.” Present
party line-up is: Gair Labor, 26;
Bukowski Labor, 23 ; Country party, 16 ;
Liberals, 8 ; Independents, 2.

Judgment in the Federal basic-wage
case was delivered on Monday. The
Court refused the application for restora-
tion of quarterly adjustments, but in-
creased the wage by 10s. a week, with a
promise of an annual review. The new
figure for Sydney will be £l3 35., which
is only ss. below the N. S. Wales State
basic wage. Last November the dis-
crepancy was £1 Is., but reductions in
the State figure in the December and
March quarters narrowed it down to 15s.

Is this the long-predicted Russo-
Chinese fall-out?
Calwell, once one of Labor’s most
vocal sons, doesn’t sound-off much these
days, but last week he ventured an ex-
planation of Labor’s view bn the Suez
dispute. He said the party opposed the
British-French attack on Egypt, but the
position concerning Israel was different.
If Israel considered Egypt was poised to
destroy her, then Israel was justified in
getting in first. Arthur was speaking at
a Zionist meeting, so perhaps Bert will
excuse him for suggesting that there may
be exceptions to Labor’s 100 per cent.
U.N. policy.

Maurice Nathan, leader of the Sell
Victoria Mission, on departing for the
U.S.: “We have a wonderful product
to sell. We are hopeful of great success.”
Had U.S. interests in Australia last year
remitted all earnings overseas, they would
have absorbed 43 p.c. of Australia’s
total dollar earnings for the year. The
dominant earner, G.M.-H., is located
chiefly in Victoria, so there might not
be a great deal of Nathan’s State left to
sell with any certainty of collecting the
dividend.

A Royal Arch Druid and his wife, just
arrived from Tahiti, called at The
Bulletin office the other day. His name
is S. Jackson Coleman, he is 70, and
is a barrister of the Middle Temple,
although he hasn’t practised law for many
years. His main interest is folklore
(magic and Esperanto are others) and he
began, some 52 years ago, by giving
lectures on legal folklore; but he was
quickly drawn into the main stream of
his subject, and has written extensively
FOLKLORE
on the folklore of every county in
England. He has lived on* the Isle of
Man for seven years—“wonderful folk-
lore country”—and casually mentioned
the Fairy Bridge there, where one raises
one’s hat on pain of a puncture (if driv-
ing a car): “We did!” he said, beam-
ing: “I mean, we didn’t, and we had a
puncture! ” Mrs. Coleman suggested
that something similar had happened to
the Queen on her visit to the Isle of Man.
No, her husband said firmly: the Queen
had conformed to local tradition when
crossing the enchanted bridge. Mrs.
Coleman is Hungarian. They met in
Austria, at an Esperanto Conference.
The marriage ceremony, in 1926, was in
Esperanto.
The visitor talked about folklore in a
hundred countries; of linked beliefs and
myths in widely separated parts of the
world ; of ceremony and mystery in the
life of primitive man; the survival of
legends in parts of England—for instance,
in Somerset and Cornwall, where the
belief persists that Christ was brought to
England as a child by Joseph of
Arimathea. “The interesting part is this,”
Coleman said. “They were supposed to
have come across Europe. And in France,
along the supposed route, the peasants
have the same belief.”
But Druids —were there any in this
part of the world? Yes, indeed. The
Colemans had just left a gathering of
them; in fact, Mrs. Coleman, a few
minutes before, had been initiated into
the order, in a building in Pitt-street,
Sydney.

“Joanne”: Died in Sydney at 97, turf
personality William Joseph (“Sandy”)
Thompson. He was the Australian Jockey
Club’s “messenger-boy” for 34 years
before he retired several years ago, and

dismounted at Randwick after a race,
Sandy invariably shouted: “Don’t forget

He was always in a “sweat” that jockeys
wouldn’t make the weight. Before he

“Kros”: South Australian Police Com-
missioner Ivor Bren Green, whose death
was but briefly noted in B. 17/4/’57,
joined the Local Courts Department at
Port Pirie in 1913 as a junior clerk, and
was associated with S.A. courts till 1948,
apart from World War II service -in the
R.A.A.F. In 1948 he was appointed
secretary to the then Commissioner,
W. F. Johns, and in 1950 became Com-
tpissioner. His wide law-courts ex-
perience proved invaluable. He made
several innovations in police methods
(such as regular conferences with com-
missioned officers) which have helped to
maintain the Force at a high level of
efficiency. For his work in charge of
the State’s police during the visit of the
Queen and Duke of Edinburgh in 1954,
he received the award of the Royal Vic-
torian Order.


“J.F.”: I met David Petherbridge, one
of the three sons of Dr. W. C. Pether-
bridge, the Sydney child-specialist, soon
after War 11, at his parents’ table: a quiet
young man, an accountancy-student, and
grade tennis-player, occasionally dropping
a dry comment on his younger brother’s chatier
about University Football Club politics and Vet.
Faculty doings during the meal. Colin, the
younger brother (now a Doctor of Veterinary
Science), an ex-Navy, type, was then playing
first-grade Rugby Union; I had known him at
school. The third boy,
John, was training as a
diplomatist.
There was nothing
in David Petherbridge’s
manner or conversa-
tion to suggest that
he was then turning
over in his mind plans
which matured, in
1954, in the “Men of
the Land” Society, an
organisation which
aims to educate all
Australians in proper
land - use, and our
essential dependence
on the land. It all
began some years back,
on Militat Planta-
tion, Madang.
David, an A.I.F.
subaltern, opened a
Bulletin dated July 4,
1945, and read a review
of Richard St. Barbe
Baker’s book, /
Planted Trees: not that
he was particularly
interested in trees at
the time; but a quota-
tion about a plant
growing on the island
interested him, and
when he wrote home
he asked his mother
to get the book for
him. The book was
published in England,
and he was a civilian
when it arrived. But
after he read it he
wrote to the author, and became progressively
interested in afforestation, soil-conservation, and
the like. He went to the Soil Conservation
people and asked questions, such as these:
What has been done about soil-conservation in
N.S.W., (a) by Government departments, ( b >
by private persons? What finance is available
for this work? What percentage of farmers
and graziers make use of the facilities that are
available? And went on to put similar ques-
tions to other Government departments, and
/) individuals. So far from making a nuisance
of himself, he found that most of the people
he approached were delighted to find someone
interested enough to try to find out for himself.
And so the society was launched. To my
mind, the most remarkable thing about the
launching was the preparatory work by
Petherbridge.
He aroused the interest of people like the
late Mr. Justice Weir (the first president),
Sir Frank Berryman, Major-General D.
Macarthur Onslow, Harry Budd, E. A. Sobthee,
Colonel H. F. White, Jack Scarr (g.m. of
Hunter Valley Co-op. Dairy Co.), Jocelyn
Henderson, J. A. Ferguson (Milk Board), Cyril
Jacka, Sir Garfield Barwick and Sir Stanton
Hicks. They, and others, were all very early
members. Sir Richard Boyer, A.B.C. chairman
(and grazier), Sam Hordern, R.A.S. president,
Mrs. Cullen, president of the Country
Women’s Association, E. O. Schlunke,
P. A. Yeomans, H. J. Geddes, Vincent
Fairfax, D. A. Pratten, the Hereford breeder,
R. C. Gibson, president of the Primary Pro-
ducers’ Union, joined a little later. Sir William
McKell, whose interest in soil-conservation goes
back to the forming of a soil-conservation service
in N.S.W., when he was Premier, is the present
president.
Petherbridge has been the driving-spirit in the
society from the beginning. Until recently,
when Emeritus Professor of Agriculture R. D.
Watt took-over as executive-officer, hon. sec.
Petherbridge did the society’s paper-work prac-
tically single-handed. Now 38, an accountant,
his Hunter-street office is the society’s h.q.
Victorian accountants have chosen as
their State president of the Australian
Society of Accountants a man who knows
not only all the figures, but all the facts.
He is Vaiben Louis Solomon, a noted
authority on mechanised accounting, who
gives engaging lectures on machines and
has even written a text-book on them. He
has the reputation of being one of Mel-
bourne’s best raconteurs, and is a student
of racing facts and figures, too.
LAND SOCIETY
Off the vice-regal chain in Victoria for
six months —Sir Dallas and Lady Brooks,
now homeward bound in the Iberia, with
their daughter, son-in-law and grandson,
after a warm farewell from a large crowd.
Brooks has the happy knack, charac-
teristic of a certain type of Englishman,
of being strictly correct on formal
occasions and a relaxed companion on
others. Both he and Lady Brooks, during
their eight years in Victoria, have done
their jobs with a marked lack of preten-
tious poppycock—an explanation, in part,
of the warmth of feeling for them. The
other part is their record of work well
done.

“Wandana”: The Deloraine (Tas.)
R.S.L. club now houses the steering-wheel
of the H.M.A.S. Deloraine —the corvette
which, in 1942, Lt.-Commander Thomp-
son commanding, sank a large submarine
off Darwin. Tasmania’s Resident Naval
Officer, Commander A. R. Green,
performed the unveiling ceremony and
related something of the corvette’s story
in her 170,000 miles of steaming, and
her former commander gave some first-
hand information concerning the wheel-
relic.
• •
“Collins Street”: It may be hard, as
they say, to get a quid, but it is more
difficult, even for a money-maker like
the late Sir Norman Myer, to keep it for
a generation. Of his estate, valued for
probate at £373,000 recently, £160,000
will go in death-duties and £75,000 to
long-time Myer employees in Melbourne
and Adelaide.
This latest Myer will is remarkable.
He wasn’t one of the founders, so he
didn’t get in on the ground-floor—in fact,
when Myer’s had become the dominant
popular shop in Melbourne in the early
’twenties, he was still a stunt-flyer
delivering newspapers for the “Herald.”
He was a quiet junior member of the
staff in Adelaide and Melbourne until
uncle Sidney Myer, the founder, died, and
it would be a fallacy to believe that such
a large fortune (as money goes in Aus-
tralia) could be made from retail profits
in 20 years by a junior-shareholder.
Like most of the Myers, Sir Norman
was a shrewd speculator. (Sidney told
me not long before he died that on his
latest visit to New York he had been
delayed, and, for an interest, had picked
some likely stocks in Wall Street for a mild
flutter, and, to his astonishment, made
20,000 dollars in a fortnight.) He financed
many small, enterprising Melbourne
companies and dealt actively in land,
shares and farms.
• •
“Video”: Sergeant (2nd Class) Denis
William Doherty, of the Queensland
police-force, at present stationed at Cairns.
in the traffic-branch, was born at Gordon-
vale (N.Q.); and there is just a trace of
the brogue in his calm, quiet voice to
indicate that his parents came from the
Emerald Isle. A great favorite with the
schoolchildren, to whom he is “the nice
policeman who tells us about road-
safety,” he has been credited (unofficially)
with the remarkable drop in traffic-
breaches in the northern city. He has
recently been credited (officially) with a
Queensland record—he is the first
member of that police-force to get his
LL.B. and qualify as a barrister. Behind
this achievement lies a nine-year story of
sheer guts. Starting from taws, he first
had to gain Adult Matriculation, and
then, hampered by routine transfers,
pursue his law-studies.

Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 62, Svend Haunstaip,
founder and managing-director of the Aus-
tralia-wide civil-engineering and contracting firm
of Haunstrup and Co. Pty., Ltd. Born in
Denmark, he founded the business shortly alter
coming to Australia in the 1920’5. The firm
has constructed buildings at the Broken Hill
mines, at the paper-mills at Burnie (Tas.) and
at the Portland Cement works, Geelong.
At Ipswich (Q.), at 92, J. P. Bottomley,
principal of the meat and pastoral firm which
bore his name. He was an Ipswich alderman for
27 years, member of Purga shire-council for
nine years, patron and president of Ipswich
Show Society, and a foundation-member of
the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce and
Rotary Club.
In Sydney, at 71, Dr. A. H. a’Court, well-
known Macquarie-street specialist. A past
president of the B.M.A.
In an accident during a race at Morphettville
(Adelaide), at 25, Keith Jessup, one of S.A.’s
leading jockeys.
In Spain, at 68, Father Joseph Muset-Fenrer,
organist, composer, and teacher. He was Pro-
fessor of Sacred Music at St. Patrick’s College,
Manly (N.S.W.), from 1939 to 1945.


ABORIGINALITIES
WEWAK THAT WAS
YE7HAT an interesting Outhouse of
* ' Empire was Wewak in the old pre-
war days, when the Sepik goldfield was
in its heyday and Wewak was its front
door ; when it was a common occurrence
for a noble savage from the neighboring
hills to march up to the District Office
to state his business wearing simply
nothing but a dignified look and a distinc-
tive odor ; when Ah Nam of Wewak’s
Chinatown earned a rightful place in any
history of literature by making a new
windsock for the aerodrome and render-
"I’m Writing my memoirs !”
ing his account to the Administration
for “one bag of constant wind” ; when
an improperly frivolous officer, looking
out his window and catching the eye of
one of those naked visitors just coming
up the District Office steps, drew back
his lips in a mad, mirthless smile and
caused his upper dental plate to drop
down and forward, whereupon the visitor
turned towards his native hills in a mag-
mficent run which did not anticipate
Landy and Kuts in the record-books only
because there was no time to start the
stopwatch before he was past the
finishing-line and out of sight beyond it.
As far as is known he has never since
been seen by a white man.
Present-day Wewak might be much
bigger and brighter in a suburban way,
but there is now, no doubt, many another
place just like it. In those days, the over-
worked word “unique” was the simple
and correct word to describe it; that
there could have been another place like
it anywhere in the world is something not
to be believed by those who knew it then.
A feature of those golden days was the
rather frequent necessity to invoke what
was called the Dog Act against some of
the more bibulous characters who toiled
on that thirsty field. By New Guinea
standards, it took a lot indeed to amount
to excessive drinking, but, when some
unfortunate really overdid it even by
those high standards, there issued from
the District Office—for his protection
from himself—a document saying
“Whereas and whereas and whereas, now
therefore I” declare a drought of stated
duration for that person,
*"pHE great Tamsun, whose utterly
-L illegible signature graced these docu-
ments. was rather a strict and unswerving

to j n that spot), and there were few

give or sell it to a person whose name
appeared in a current Dog Act over that
signature.
The top of the high, flat peninsular hill
at Wewak (town-planned by the great
Tamsun) was occupied by the bungalows
of the Administration staff, in cool and
stately isolation from the place below—
where everyone else had to live unless he
earned a sojourn on the cool, well-
ordered plateau by being admitted to the
European hospital. The District Office
was half-way up the hill-, so that the
public visiting it (whether colored or
white, naked or draped) would not dis-
turb the serene sanctity of the private
Olympus, but far enough up to make it
hard to get there, so that anyone who
undertook the stiff tropical climb really
had serious business and didn’t merely
call to waste official time.
Quite early in my stay there, one of the
agents (whom the scattered miners ‘ re-
tained to look after their affairs at “the
beach”) rushed up that steep rise to the
District Office, looking like an extremely
worried man, and panted out, “When
does So-and-So’s Dog Act expire?” Told
that it expired that very day, he rushed
off muttering, “Hell, I forgot all about
it—l’ve got to get a cargo of grog out
to him and that plane’s probably got a
full load already—l’ll have to charter a
special flight.”
Thus I learned of the custom of the
“coming-out party,” which etiquette
required the enforced abstainer to throw
in celebration of the breaking of the
. drought. This was before the days of
Alcoholics Anonymous or the more
scientific approach to such problems. If
the celebrant withstood his coming-out
party without becoming immediately
eligible for another citation in “The New
Guinea Gazette,” it could safely be
assumed that the treatment had
resulted in a cure.
CLOVISKI MACODOACER.
/"\NE winter in a Stanthorpe (Q.) survey-
camp we became the owners of a
couple of baby wedgetailed-eagles.
With visions of a unique survey-camp
with a retinue of eagles we nourished the
youngsters tenderly. A box lined with
straw and bags became their nest and
was kept close to the campfire for
warmth. Then we learned that wedge-
tails are cleanly birds and that our pair
had been house-broken. When it felt
the urge to evacuate, the chick would
stand, point towards the centre of the
nest with its head and towards the
perimeter with its tail, and discharge
with a velocity which carried
it several feet, well clear of the nest. In
that frosty weather we used to have
breakfast around the fire, making toast
or eating porridge, and we soon were
taught by startling experience to keep
one eye on the movements of those birds.

“Q. Ree”: In old Fiji, it was such an
insult to sneeze in the presence of the
chief that he was just as likely to club
anyone who did so. If, however, he
decided to spare the sneezer’s life, he said


SHOWING 'EM!


“Mbula,” to which the pardoned man
replied “Moli” (thank you). As “moli”
also means citrus-fruii, this is another case
where the answer is a lemon.

“Archbell”: Years ago on our South
Gippsland farm, a visitor kidded Mum
that it was possible to persuade a turkey-
gobbler to hatch-out a clutch of eggs.
The only catch was that the bird had to
be kept charged with wine. Mum got a
quart of plonk at the local pub and
managed to get his Nibs outside a cupful
of it. He sat all right, too shick to move
for two days. Then he started to get
shifty and another charge of the grape
sat him back on the eggs for another few
days. The grog ran out before the incu-
bation was half-way, so Mum called it
a day. The gobbler staggered back to his
harem and after a couple of days was
strutting around full of pep again. Mum,,
still on deck at 90, still moans over the
two-bob she blew on the wine and'two-
dozen spoilt turkey-eggs.

“Wandana”: Two 8000-ton steamers
berthed alongside one another at Bell
Bay (Tas.) recently. One was the Port
Wellington (owned by the Port Line), in
to load fruit ; the other was an Ellerman

due to carry jrway nearly 10,000 bales
of wool.

ing on a cattle-station in the Gulf country,

“Moreen”: In what way does an owl’s
wing differ from that of a magpie,
enabling the owl to fly in silence? I sat
milking the cow in the half-light of dusk
when an owl began to chase a maggie
round and about a small sugargum-
plantation near by. As Maggie fled,
twisting and turning through the trees,
her wing-beats were plain to hear in the
calm evening air, yet the owl flew in
complete silence —in fact, so silently that
I'd have thought it was a case of magpie-
madness if the owl’s bulky shape didn’t
glide past every now and then.

“S.”: As an admirer of Stonehenge and
the Easter Island statues 1 found myself
immensely intrigued by two gigantic,
perfectly rounded boulders —each about
6ft. through—which I lately saw sit-
ting in the paddocks near Dargaville in
New Zealand. Mr. Gilbert Archey, the
director of the Auckland museum, kindly
informs me that they are “undoubtedly
large pieces of volcanic rock which have
weathered to a somewhat spherical con-
dition,” and I suppose that is final. But
they didn’t look “somewhat spherical”
to me, but very spherical indeed. I’ve
seen lots of volcanic rocks and hum-
mocks, and plenty of Australia’s
rounded granite outcrops ; but nothing
like these anywhere ; and I cling yet to
a faint hope that they may be monuments
of prehistoric man . . . No?

“J.B.'”: The healthiness and abundance
of the rabbits at present on the Nullarbor

“E. &O. E.”: Living with her brother,
Dante Gabriel Rossetti, at Chelsea,.
London, in the early 1860’s poetess
Christina Rossetti kept wombats that
grazed on a lawn and were great pets.
They are mentioned in several books
about this period. Did Christina’s
wombats come from Tasmania? It would
seem likely, for there they are smaller,
more cuddlesome ' and possibly less
addicted to digging than their mainland
brothers. No one has mentioned digging
when describing Christina's wombats,
and 1 have never yet found any account
of them by herself. Lewis Carroll in
writing Alice in Wonderland was inspired
by one of these wombats to introduce
the dormouse into his story. In the
editions illustrated by Tenniel and
approved by the author this dormouse
looks remarkably like a very small
wombat.
‘Mas.”: Conspicuous cock-birds which
have drably-dressed wives notably
robins, whistlers and fairy-wrens—don’t
usually do much baby-sitting. They often
help build the home and sometimes bring
food to the brooding hen, but nest-protec-
tion seems their main duty. If the
intruders are small and harmless they are
expelled by force or scoldings, but
predators are mostly decoyed away from
the nest-area. In this task brilliant
plumage helps in a really remarkable
manner, which suggests that sexual-selec-
tion may not wholly, account for the
beauty of many male birds.
WINSOME WEATHER
7 catch my mare, a shadow-tiling,
By wagtail’s drowsy twittering
And ride, (done in my delight,
A quiet mile of waning night,
The striding mare's blown breath as sweet
As grasses at her rhythmic feet;
But at the gate by the lucerne patch
First-light fumbles the frosty latch.
—Ho sun! Bring a day of winsome
weather !
And the sun and I ride through together,
Lighting about us as we pass,
Lanterns in the astonished grass,
And clear across a mile of plain
The magpie wakes his love again,
And joyful flight of leaping lambs
Play tip-and-touch with gilded dams.
The sun and I ride on together,
Into a day of winsome weather.

AS we approached the small selection
the Missus said, “Look, they’ve got
flywire doors —just like I want you to put
on our place.” When we got close to the

enough—wire-netting to keep the fowls
out. —“Nildem.”

“1.H.P.”: In the rain, mud and fog
of the Festival 500 Car Trial staged at
Bathurst (N.S.W.), some of the contestants
overshot road-junctions and one car was
navigated (in the middle of the night) to
Portland instead of Dark Corner. The
navigator leaned out of the window of
the car and asked a passing resident,
“Which way to Dark Corner, mate?” The
resident said thoughtfully, “There’s one
in the next block.”

“Shamuseen”: Torres Straits Islanders
don’t consider Christian-names necessary,
and the single patronymic is the rule.
Confusion of father and son is avoided
simply by Repoam becoming Big Repoam
with the birth of his son, who is thence-
forth Little Repoam, while the new
arrival’s grandfather, if still living, is
daubed Old Big Repoam. The Islanders’
life-span is not great enough to permit of
the system’s being disturbed by the advent
of great-grandchildren.

“Cowyard Kate”: Was driving along
a back-road one night when a rabbit,
stricken with myxomatosis, dashed
blindly across the road ahead of us. No
sooner had he passed beyond the range
of our headlights than high-pitched
rabbit-squeals split the darkness. We
stopped the car and waited. Seconds
later, the squealing, terrified myxo.-
victim recrossed the road and was racing
round and round in circles with four or
five seemingly-healthy rabbits biting it,
fighting it, and giving it a helluva time.
“Yes,” said my brother, “they’ve
apparently learned a thing or two —they
won’t allow a myxo. victim in their
burrow.”

“Sam”: The placing of three pines in
a row before a Jacobite’s house (B.
20/3/’57) was intended to enable agents
from the exiled Stuart Court on the Con-
tinent to identify sympathisers. The
practice was followed by English, Welsh
and Scottish adherents of the Stuarts.
Jacobitism was strong among the Welsh
country gentry in the 18th century. The
Cycle of the White Rose, a Jacobite club
that continued to function into this cen-
tury, was mainly Welsh in membership.
The three pines can still be seen in front
of many old Welsh houses that had early
Jacobite owners. They are popularly
referred to as “Prince Charlie’s trees.”

“Baksac”: The lovely chiming of
bellbirds doesn’t make sweet music for
timbercutters. The belief used to be
general that where bellbirds were heard
the timber wasn’t worth cutting, because
of their constant picking at it. A more
enlightened view completely exonerates
the bronze-green songsters of damaging
the timber ; on the contrary, they feed on
the borer that riddles it. Thus, although
the timbercutters unwittingly defamed a
Good Samaritan, their belief was well-
enough founded—where bellbirds are
heard the timber could be riddled. A
bellbird must eat, so, no borers, no
bellbirds.

nr HAT finicky supercargo (B. 9/1 /’57)
takes me back to the days when the
world was young and I was supercargo
on the Amra, a small inter-island hooker
trading in Fiji waters. As well as a
heterogeneous cargo, we carried a number
of deck-passengers, mostly Indian coolies
and islanders. The fares ranged from 6s.
to 12s. per head and were collected when
the ship was bucking her way to the next
stop.
Collecting from the islanders was no
problem, but, until I woke up, extracting
the dibs from the Indians generally
resulted in a squeamy stomach and a
shortage of cash. The Indian usually
carried his fare tied in the corner of his
sulu dropped inside his waist, well down.
He would painfully extract one coin at
a time and place it in his cheek. When
he had the desired amount, say eight-
bob, he would belch it all into his fist
and pass it over. This was too much for
me, so I just held out the bag and let
him drop it in.
The procedure must have been closely
observed by his cobbers, for, when I
counted the lot later in the oflfice-cwm-
stateroom-cwm-general-meeting-house, it
was always a few bob short with a few
annas in the collection. Annas then being
only worth 10d., they added to my woes.
Later, I used a piece of board and a
length of wire to count and sort the legal
tender.
If ever there was a potpourri of prime
stinks that hooker was it. Sun-dried
copra is penetrative but not too odious.
But blended with effluvium of goats, sici
shell, unwashed humanity and primitive
sanitation it produces a very rare aroma.
At the last stop we would take on cattle
and then head for Suva and, with one of
those enchanted breezes wafting us along,
could usually be reported before being
actually sighted.
Von Luckner, of Sea Adler fame, took
umbrage at being “collected” by what he
termed a “dirty little cattle-tramp.” It
was the old odorous Amra.

Business, Robbery, Etc.
MANAGEMENT AND RESOURCES
'T’HE present period of tight
credit conditions, slack-
ened demand and other trading
problems is emphasising the
value of management in busi-
ness. This means not only
efficiency in manufacturing,
but also expertness in gauging
public demand.
In addition to quality in
management, another virtue in
some businesses stands out —
that is past conservatism in
distributions of profits. The
concern with reserve-accumu-
lations matching or exceeuing
its capital is even able to with-
stand serious (but temporary)
miscalculations by manage-
ment and still survive, whereas
the company that has not been
able to build up reserve
strength may get no second
chance.
In picking investments these
days it is' therefore hardly
enough to consider last year’s
earning-power. The balance-
sheet calls for as much study
as the profit-and-loss account.
And in studying the assets and
liabilities a. variety of factors
need to be considered.
First of all, of course,
liquidity. Banks, because of
overall central-bank policy,
aren’t as free to co-operate
with their clients as they might
otherwise be, and "elbow-
room” in one’s financial
arrangements is a most valu-
able asset. The concern with
a comparatively easy liquid
position therefore has much
more room to move around
and meet trading problems than
has the concern which has
reacked the limit of its over-
draft and doesn’t possess the
security to raise other forms
of finance.
The business which has been
established for a long time and
owns its own premises and
plant often is in a stronger
position than the liquid posi-
tion alone would indicate.
Over the past five years or
more there have been many
revaluations of premises by
concerns with the objective of
making the accounts show “a
more realistic picture of the
business in relation to present-
day values.” Sometimes these
revaluations have been accom-
panied by an issue of bonus
shares: sometimes not.
In any case, the old-estab-
fished business usually has an
advantage over the younger
one when it comes to inner
strength in fixed assets. This
is particularly so in connection
with premises. In the case of
plant, the older co. may have
well-bought plant in good
operating order, but it may be
obsolescent by comparison
with its younger rival’s more
expensive recent purchase.
Every case has to be studied
“Now —just to make a fool of me, it Works."
to get a true picture in this
connection, and the nature of
the industry has a bearing on
it. For example, cement-
making plant bought 20 years
ago is probably little more
obsolete than that bought last
year, whereas some hosiery-
making machinery may have
dated much more rapidly.
At first view, however, the
advantages should be with the
older company, especially if it
has a history of progressive
management.
Another source of strength
in older companies is fre-
quently an interest in a subsi-
diary company, or a business
partly owned but not fully con-
trolled. If the parent or share-
holding company has been
comparatively affluent for a
decade or more, it may have
preferred to let the smaller
associate build up its financial
strength, possibly without dis-
closing this to the shareholding
public.
Every so often a w'ell-known
concern will announce a little
more than the fact that "the
profits of subsidiary com-
panies have been included in
the accounts of the parent
only to the extent of dividends
received.” When it does so
there may be a pleasant
surprise.
In any case, it is clear that
well-established and enterpris-
ing concerns are more likely to
have this sort of a nest-egg
than are the younger concerns
which have had barely time
to establish themselves.
All these factors are worth
particular notice now . that
trading experiences have be-
come patchy throughout indus-
try. and shareniarket interest
has tended to huddle-up among
the leaders. Concentration of
investment funds on shares
like those of 8.H.P., A.C.L,
Burns Philp, Woolworths, G.
J. Coles, 1.C.1. and the pick
of the insurance companies has
brought the yields available
from such stocks down to a
low level. The investor would
like to switch-over to second-
line stocks giving a better yield
—if he only knew which ones
to pick.
Clearly it isn't enough to go
by yields alorte, even on the
rate of the most.recent interim
dividend. Investment should
follow only a close case-history
study.
The Favored Few
TOASTER holidays didn’t bring
any marked slackening in
demand for leading industrials.
B.H.P. opened a shade stronger,
with 1.C.1. also up a few pence.
Bank of N.S.W. was steady,
and that other heavy-
weight, C.S.R., was down
slightly ; but, on the whole, the
favored few on thp Stock
Exchange continued to be
highly favored. Henry Jones
was down a bit, but chain-
stores were in demand.
Among the second-liners,
Bradford Cotton was un-
changed at 40s. 6d., but weak-
ness was still evident in Aus-
tralian Woollen Mills, which
was on offer at 325., no buyers.
Though this co. has maintained
its interim at 5 p.c. (10 p.c.
p.a.) it has reported more
difficult ttading conditions,
with turnover and production
both down. In past years it has
been a high profit-earner, and
has gained its full share of
whatever trade has been offer-
ing. Just at present the worsted
industry is having a thi« time
because of the higher cost of
wool, which has snread into
selling - prices. Oddly, the
woollen (blanket, etc.) trade is
not vet suffering so badly on
the sales side.
The variegated nature of share
prices at present may seem odd
to observers of post-war
vintage,-but it is a more normal
condition than anything we
have seen for the past 17 years.
The balance of overseas pay-
ments, internal competition
and internal costs are having
a natural effect on economic
conditions—that is, as natural
as can be expected in an
economy still subject to a
superabundance of controls,
from industrial arbitration to
import-controls and central-
bank restriction of credit.
Second Row
HTHE £1 shares in Bradford
Cotton Mills are always
worth consideration when
around 40s. each. They yield
a little over 6 p.c. on the present
124- p.c. basis. Bradford has
an enterprising management
and a solid business, and any-
one desiring a yield rather
higher than that obtainable
from the front-liners will find
Bradford worth looking into.
It has its long-term possibilities,
too, though perhaps not so
obviously as in the case of
chemicals or steel.
A very solid investment,
among the less active Sydney
listings, is Frederic Ash, of
Newcastle. Though builders’
hardware may be quieter than
it has been, Frederic Ash has
been a consistently high profit-
earner, and recently has dis-
closed earnings sufficient to
cover the 15 p.c. div. more than
twice over. Its finances are
exceptionally strong, and it

a shade under 5 p.c. on this

tion by investors’ support.
The Shape of Things
[By L. Owen]
first quarter of 1957
was not an inspiring one
in the history of the search for
oil in Australia, but it forms
an interesting contrast with the
corresponding period of 1954,
which covered an oil-boom
characterised by a degree of
hysteria which sufficed to bring
world-wide notoriety.
During that first period it
was possible, without difficulty
or delay, to float an oil com-
pany—for a million or more-
on the statement that the pro-
moters had an option on an
area which was underlain, in
part, by sedimentary strata.
Many moribund concerns, also,
which for years had been
frittering away their funds in
geologically ridiculous activi-
ties and which would have been
better dead, were able to dis-
pose of stock, unsaleable in
times of sanity, at high prices,
and thus obtain a new lease of
life.
The “experts” behind such
flotations often showed, in
interviews to the less respon-
sible section of the press, a
naive ignorance of the tech-
nique of oil-finding, and it was
obvious that their knowledge
was derived from elementary
text-books and the “flicks.” In
spite of that, it was almost im-
possible for an experienced
petroleum-geologist to get a
hearing, as his work had taught
him caution. Moreover, a
critical examination of the
known facts of Australian geo-
logy indicated that well-loca-
tions, with any hope of success,
would have to be chosen with
great care and circumspection.
Before the oil-boom struck
the country it was accepted, as
a working basis, that the Aus-
tralian mainland had remained
above sea-level from Upper
Permian throughout Triassic
times and in to the Lower
Cretaceous. This conception,
although it has been modified
in minor detail by the geo-
logical surveys and deep-drilling
carried out by the major oil
companies, is still accepted,
and the general fact remains
that a major hiatus in the
marine stratigraphical column
persisted over most of the
continent throughout Triassic
times.
During stages of that long
terrestrial Epoch—which, in
some parts, was extended to
almost a Period on the geo-
logical time-scale —the land-
mass was subjected to folding,
heavy faulting and erosion,
and these processes, both
singly and in conjunction,
caused the broaching of some
of the petroleum accumulations
trapped below the surface, thus
giving birth to oil-seepages.
Owing\to the length of time
during which these seeps were
continuously exposed, in Wes-
tern Australia, to the Triassic
atmosphere, it could be fore-
cast that nearly all of the oil
which reached the surface
would be dispersed. In most
instances it found its way to
the sea and disappeared. In
some cases, however, the oil
travelled so slowly that,
through inspissation, the oil
lost its fluidity and was thus
preserved to some extent. As
a rarer occurrence, the seeping
oil was adsorbed by water-
borne clay-particles and then
deposited to form a mudstone
showing traces of oil. Such
mudstones are often mistaken
for primary “source”-beds.
Material for drawing the
main outlines of the picture
presented above was available,
with reference to the Austra-
lian mainland, before 1940.
It is a pity that it was not used
as a hypothesis for explaining
some of the anomalies en-
countered in the well-drilling
and geophysical-survey inter-
pretations of the Carnarvon
Basin of Western Australia,
and it is rather ironical that
proof of the existence of rem-
•nants of seepages within that
structure should have been
obtained —quite unexpectedly—
in the first Rough Range test-
well.
In seepage areas, the siting
of wells which have a chance
of producing commercial quan-
tities of oil is a difficult enough
problem, even when the seeps
are active and still uncovered,
and should be attempted only
by petroleum-geologists who
possess the very specialised
experience gained by many
years of field-work in such
areas. The problem becomes
even more difficult when much
of the evidence is hidden by
the deposition of younger beds,
Under such circumstances,
academic qualifications, how-
ever outstanding, in themselves
are useless and may constitute
a handicap.
In W.A., geophysical-survey
methods have been greatly
favored for penetrating the
obscuring blanket of younger
strata ; unfortunately, the
physical characteristics of these
strata have caused distortion
in the geophysical graphs,
whose correct interpretation,
anyway, is dependent upon a

In other States in Australia,
the effects of the long periods
of non-deposition and erosion,
as well as. the presence of

adversely affected the prospects

State, in fact, offers its unique
problems which will have to be
solved by specially-adapted
techniques, although there is
little sign of attempting to do
this at the moment.
In my considered opinion,
the best prospects of com-
mercial production still lie
along the Western Australian
coast, and for varying distances
inshore, from Dirk Hartog to
Barrow Island. Any retreat
from this area will not be jus-

“Hamlet”
Watching the run and rush of
Paul Rogers’s Hamlet at Syd-
ney’s Elizabethan Theatre one’s
mind suddenly turned to the
run and rush of water; to
things like Southey’s “Cataract
at Lodore,” and then, with
more satisfaction, to a letter or
e:say by Rupert Brooke
describing Niagara Falls the
headlong tumult, excitement
and frenzy of the water as it
approaches the falls and the
last instant of momentary calm
before it plunges into the cata-
clysm below.
There was that sort of force
and movement about Rogers.
The face curiously like that of
a satyr ; the slim black figure
relieved only by the brief star-
like gleam of silver around his
neck ; the lips drawn back so
that you could see the teeth
snapping off the words; the
quick leap and twist of his
movements —this was a Hamlet
directly bent on revenge ; agile,
active and alert; rushing so
fast to his destiny that the old
questions about his hesitations
did not seem to arise. There
was little loitering on phrase or
melancholy moodiness here ;
rather a fast, deliberate
accounting which yet missed
nothing of words, action and
meaning.
It was, perhaps, Mr. Rogers’s
misfortune to play to an
audjence which, it seemed from
foyer-comment, had seen the
film but never read the book
—Olivier’s name was heard so
often that it sounded like the
call of the ice-cream boy. It
should be noted, then, that this
is a better Hamlet than
Olivier’s screen-version. For
all the doubts and confusion of
mind —which do not escape
Mr. Rogers for one moment
there is no sighing
sentiment here, no empty
silences and none of those box-
office tricks —such as switching
“To be, or not to be . . .” so
that it followed the scene with
Ophelia and became, instead
of an explanation, the outcome
of a lovers’ quarrel. Mr. Rogers
spun magnificently from the
mood of his soliloquy to his
renunciation of Ophelia, and
his burst of fury was really
something to see.
It was also Mr. Rogers’s mis-
fortune to head a cast which
had a comparatively weak tail.

and dangerous, like a gross,
black boar, was very accept-
able; Maree Tomasetti’s Queen,
her shallow delights ripped to
pieces in a superb scene with
Rogers, rose excellently to the
occasion; and David Butler’s
Polonius, a sharp-toned old
bore, almost wiped out ' the
memory of Felix Aylmer.
But then, what a falling-off:
Zoe Caldwell’s peaky Ophelia,
with the pool-like eyes and
thin mouth and the milkmaid’s
bonnet, suddenly coming on
like a wild-eyed, full-bosomed
witch, a contrast so startling
that it was left to Miss Toma-
setti’s soft rendering of “There
is a willow . . to earn her
any sympathy ; Frank Gatliff’s
Horatio failing in the closing
lines of which Norman
Wooland made such unforget-
table, final music; the thin-
whiskered nervousness of
Frederick Parslow’s Laertes ;
Clement McCallin’s roaring
ghost these things made one
doubly grateful for the clear
and urgent assurance with
which Mr. Rogers swept
through his problems.
The costumes by Alistair
Roberts and Gladys, Jennings
were perhaps a trifle rich for
the occasion and surely
there is no need to send Osric
bouncing in at such a moment
and looking quite so like a
large and bilious lollipop-
but Victor Forstmann's set was
admirable to behold and of a

allowed the scene-changes to

performance and Hugh Hunt’s

Pekarek and Odnoposoff
Rudolf Pekarek began his
new season with the Queens
land Symphony Orchestra with
a splash of orchestral color
that was entirely appropriate
to the occasion. This orchestra
usually cannot cope with
modern scores that fairly
bristle with extra instruments,
but this time a contingent of
unfamiliar players overflowed
into the choir stalls for
Respighi’s “Pines of Rome.”
The opening part, children
shrieking at play around the
Villa Borghese, is one of the
liveliest scenes in music. Some
of the closely woven solo-
passages disappeared in the
hall echo, but the animation
of the music was splendidly
caught. The nightingale that
sang in the Pines of the
Janiculum was obviously a
bird of the electronic age, but
chirruped sweetly enough be-
fore its tones faded away into
the military splendors of the
Roman Army that marches
through the final section of the
piece.
When a solid phalanx of
brass-players raised trumpets
and trombones, the tramping
legions were excitingly restored
to life. Brass reinforcements
came from the Northern Com-
mand Band, their scarlet and
blue adding another kind of
brightness to the echoes of a
thousand years that seemed to
burst through the hall in this
vivid finale,

to feel that the players were
keeping too much in reserve
for the rest of the concert.
Ricardo Odnoposoff was

Looking back along the Australian years, I
am convinced that the high point in our early
developmental history was the discovery of gold
at Bathurst in 1851.
It brought a vital dispersion in the search for
gold; attracted the first thick flows of immigration;
and it lives on—in settlement, in business,
engineering and enterprise, in the economy it helped
so powerfully to raise.
I recall this now because I believe that mineral
developments in the North are about to take
Australia on to a fresh territorial awakening.
To explain, let me draw a comparison in the
State in which the most exciting mineral discoveries
have latterly been made—Queensland.
When the Bathurst gold rush began, that 22\
per cent, of the continent which is now Queensland
had a population of 8575 —6012 males and 2563
females ; an average of one person to 78 square
miles of its area. It shared in the rapid succession
of discoveries that were to make Australia at one
time the producer of 40 per cent, of the world’s
gold.
By the turn of the century, Queensland had a
population of half a million, its choicest lands were
being tilled and stocked, it had 2800 miles of
railways. Like its sisters in the emerging
Commonwealth, it was well on the way to greatness.
Queensland today possesses a triangulation of
new wealth —in Mount Isa’s expanding production
of silver-lead-zinc and copper, the spectacular
rising of nearby Mary Kathleen in uranium, and
the internationally important deposits of bauxite
to be worked in Cape York Peninsula.
In the census of 1954 the whole north-western
division of Queensland, including Mount Isa, had
a population of 19,275 ; and the Cape York
Peninsula division, apart from Thursday Island, a
mere 4436.
The years from now, I believe, will tell a
different story. If there be any who-lack the Faith
to see it. let them think back to Bathurst and the
years after 1851.

touched depths of expression,
especially in the lovely andante,
far greater than he had in any
other work of his for the key-
board. While the pianist failed
fully to capture its profundity
and wistfulness, she did bring a
secure style and crispness to
bear on the great dramatic
episodes.
The other big work was the
“Wanderer” Fantasia, Op. 15.
The opening and closing
allegros were accorded the
good quota of the exuberance
that is their due ; the variations
on the famous song which com-
prise the slow movement were
spun effectively with the aid
of a nice cantabil e-like tone ;
the scherzo suffered from in-
sufficient lilt and gaiety.
The same complaint could
not be levelled against the
playing of an arrangement by
Karl Ulrich Schnabel (with
whom the pianist studied) of a
group of 20 dances; the
rhythms here were incisive and
simply invited the foot to
become airborne.
Three Moments Musicaux
were treated in the manner
they should be —as songs
without words, for they clearly
anticipate the form exploited
by Mendelssohn.

“Petrouchka”
[I-'rom Herbert Holman, London]
The Royal Ballet lacks
neither boldness nor self-con-
fidence in reviving the original
production of this appealing
but difficult work. Merely to
recall the names presents a
formidable, almost legendary,
challenge: Stravinsky, Benois,
Fokine, Diaghilev and Ni-
jinsky, Karsavina, Kotchetov-
sky and Cecchetti, to name
only the principals of 1911.
Certainly nothing has been
spared. Benois (who not only
supplied the original decor
but also devised, with the com-
poser, the plot and main char-
acters) has emerged from re-
tirement in Paris to re-create
the work; Diaghilev’s regis-
seur-general, Grigoriev, and his
wife, Tchernicheva, have re-
produced Fokine’s choreo-
graphy and mime. To be able
to command such distinguished
authority is high praise indeed
for the international prestige
of British ballet.
The result is admirable and
exciting but just fails to be
breathtaking. Anything less
than that means, for this work,
only qualified success.
“Petrouchka” is less well-
remembered for its principals
than for the brio, color and
sparkle of the crowd-scenes.
All the individuals, one under-
stands, were separately re-
hearsed, and the production
skilfully pinpointed the suc-
cessive dances and incidents.
Only the color remains. The
revival has anglicised the title
to “Petrushka.” It has also
anglicised the crowd, which
lacks abandon, earthiness (the
nursemaids, for example, are
incongruously genteel) and
bustle. But most of all the
company, being young, lacks
experience at playing the crowd
in “Petrouchka.”
Except for Frederick Ash-
ton’s Showman (not an exact-
ing part) and Alexander
Grant’s Petrouchka —lacking
impudence but pitiful, impotent
and yet still a puppet —the
principals are not quite in
character. Peter Clegg’s
Blackamore is not brutish and
clumsy enough, which results
in Scene 111 fizzling-out. Mar-
got Fonteyn was not appear-
ing, but Nadia Nerina’s
Ballerina, though doll-like,
does not typify the flashing,
empty-headed theme given out
by the comet, as did Baronova
so well 20 years ago.

17—and it isn’t at all bad;
there is a feeling for nature in
it. Since then he has gone the
rounds of Australian teachers.
He has been a pupil of Julian
Ashton, of Dattilo Rubbo, of
a couple of other Sydney
teachers, and of the National
Gallery in Melbourne, where
he studied under Bernard Hall
and Mclnnes. Recently he
took a refresher-course with
William Dargie.
With all this multitude of
instructors giving him a leg-up
his pictures might be expected
to be a mixture of styles.
Strangely enough they are not.
Although he hasn’t shaken off
the conventions of the various
schools altogether, there is in
the majority of his later
pictures the feeling shown in his
first effort. It shows in “Pt.
Lonsdale Lighthouse,” with its
bit of stormy ocean, and in
“At Keilor,” in which he has
caught the strong light of
evening streaming over the
foothills.
“Maribyrnong, Arundel,”
gives the soft fogginess of
autumn very nicely. The girl
in “The Shawl,” with its careful
detail, seems to have been
pushed a bit too far, but a self-
portrait is a sincere piece of
painting. There is a rich glow
about the blossom in “Flower-
ing Gum.”
Films
“Moby Dick”
Whatever one may feel
about its deviations from the
essence of Melville, this,
sighted at Sydney Regent, is
still a highly impressive ex-
ample of film-making. From
the moment Ishmael walks
down into New Bedford until
at last he floats on Queequeg’s
coffin alone on the sea, the
extravagant sweep of „ the film
takes in a notably rick gallery
of characters arid a number of
scenes of equally notable
action.
There is a weakness —and a
major one—in Gregory Peck’s
Captain Ahab. Peck, an ex-
cellent actor, seems here so
concerned with the little mut-
terings and mannerisms of
madness that he misses con-
spicuously to give the charac-
ter its essential strength—
mental and physical strength
as well as a lust for revenge
grown into a great driving in-
sanity Given this central force
the film could easily have been
something much more than a
finely made action-piece. One
thinks of what Raymond
Massey or Walter Huston
might have done.
The tapestry of detail, in-
cluding the New Bedford
scenes, the departure of the
Pequod with the faces on the

in “Moby Dick," at Sydney Regent.
wharf, and the crew and the
business of the ship itself;
the action which, if it lacks
Melville’s wonderfully infor-
mative description, is at least
highly exciting ; the color, sub-
dued —as it should be—until
one is almost unaware of it;
and the acting in general—all
these things have been admir-
ably fused by director John
Huston into a clear, vigorous
narrative which, if it isn’t good
Melville, is at least very good
Hollywood.
Orson Welles, as Father
Mapple; Leo Genn, as Star-
buck; and Harry Andrews, as
Stubb (a long way from his
gallery of Shakspearian por-
traits with the Shakspeare
Memorial Theatre), all give
striking performances.

“Casa Ricordi”
This Italian film (with Eng-
lish sub-titles) at Sydney Vogue
purports to tell the story of the
rise of the world-famous music-
publishing house of Ricordi in
Milan, and in particular of the
association of its founder with
five celebrated Italian operatic-
composers : Bellini, Rossini,
Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini.
The doings of the publishing-
house itself have been made
subservient by director Car-
mine Gallone to incidents in
the lives of the composers,
and some of these have been
well salted with fiction. Verdi,
for instance, stops an incipient
riot in Palermo simply by
appearing in a carriage; he is
depicted as a man of vigorous
middle-age, then in the midst
s of composing “Otello.” In
fact, he wrote that masterpiece
at 74, and had by then long
dropped his political activities.
The brilliant, gay but lazy
Rossini selflessly abjures the
wife of his impresario-friend
—an unlikely sacrifice. Puccini
finds in Paris, before com-
posing “Boheme,” a group of
bohemians who might have
stepped straight from the pages
of Murger’s “La Vie de
Boheme,” even including a
little Mimi for himself, com-
plete with graveyard cough.
And Bellini dies during the
premiere of his “I Puritani”—
actually, the premiere was on
January 25, 1835, and Bellini
died in the following Septem-
ber, during a repeat perform-
ance of the opera, at the
conclusion of which singers
and musicians went on to the
Church of the Invalides to
render homage to the composer
by taking part in a great
requiem service.
Still, the musical side of the
film is superbly presented. It
takes the form, of excerpts
from the least-performed works
of the five composers, and they
are given, either as solos or
concerted numbers, by three of
the greatest exponents of
Italian song now living:
soprano Renata Tebaldi, tenor
Mario del Monaco and bari-
tone Tito Gobbi. They are
backed 'up by splendid
orchestral playing.
The operatic settings are
richly satisfying, and per-
formances by Marta Toren,
• Nadia Gray, Micheline Presle
and Danielle Deforme are
excellent.

York Motors (Holding), Ltd.
HPHE abnormally large profits won by
some motor-vehicle distributors
during the post-war boom tended to
obscure the fact that new-car retailing
was an intensely competitive business
before the war. The return of competitive
conditions over the past few years has
in many cases been accompanied by
lower profits, but, despite this, new-car
retailing remains a reasonably profitable
occupation. Market preferences have, of
course, favored some distributors more„
than others, but although the number
of new vehicles registered in Australia
last year (to December 31) fell by 12.9
p.c., it was still almost 50,000, or 31 p.c.,
higher than the corresponding figure for
1953.
York Motors (Holding), Ltd., and its
subsidiaries had a very good run in the
boom years, and in 1950 disclosed a net
profit equal to 172.8 p.c. of the average
paid capital employed. Earnings in these
prosperous times were largely reinvested
in the co., but by 1952 net profit had
dropped by over 50 p.c., while last term
(to November 30, ’56) saw another sub-
stantial reduction, net earnings falling
to a modest 6.2 p.c. on shareholders’
funds (as they stood at the commence-
ment of the year).
York Motors’ scrip was first listed
in 1947, eight years after the formation of
the co. and 15 years after the incorpora-
tion of its principal subsidiary. The parent
co. has a paid capital of £906,666 in ss.
ords., of which £BO,OOO came from a
one-for-five bonus issue in 1950 and
£222,666 from a one-for-three par issue
in 1952.
Through Lancaster Motors Pty., the
group shares the Sydney metropolitan
franchise for Morris, Wolseley and Riley
vehicles and Nuffield tractors, other sub-
sidiaries acting as N.S.W. distributors of
Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Plymouth, Simca
and Singer vehicles and Fargo and Willys
trucks. In Queensland the group handles
Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Willys and Austin
products, as well as tractors and earth-
moving equipment. A wholly-owned
finance co., Glasgow Investments Pty.,
takes care of the group’s hire-purchase
business.
The sharp increase in the rate of
sales-tax applicable to new cars and the
contraction of bank-credit last year
affected (among other things) sales of
new cars, while the curtailment of State
development programmes led to a big
fall in demand for earthmoving and
allied equipment. The group discloses
neither its turnover nor the number of
vehicles sold, but figures for the whole
of Australia show that in 1956 the British
Motor Corp.’s share of the new-car
market dropped from 20.8 P-c. to 17.1
p.c., while the number of new Plymouth
cars registered fell from 2593 to 1877.
(B.M.C. manufactures the group’s best-
selling lines, Austin and Morris.) The
reduced demand led to a £186,561 slip in
gross earnings (£1,620,589) for the year
to November 30 last, while overhead
and administrative charges gobbled-up an
extra £94,162, to leave net profit down
by £200,091 (45.4 p.c.) at £240,539:

The lower earnings, claimed after .pro-
viding £157,864 (down £80,632) for
taxation and £26,317 (up £6075) for
depreciation, represented a return of 26.5
p.c. from paid capital, compared with
48.6, 55.4, 53 and 136.7 p.c. in the four
preceding years. Large reserves, which
at balance-date exceeded share-capital by
£2,096,596, are largely responsible for the
prosperous-looking ratios of earlier years.
Divs. from the parent co. come from
the profits made by subsidiaries in the
preceding year, and lower profits in the
1955 term were followed in 1956 by a
reduction in the parent’s div.-rate from
30 p.c. to p.c. An interim div. on
a 20 p.c. p.a. basis went out last month
and a final div. at the same rate is
indicated.
A £600,000 note-issue was completed
last term, and a further £441,454 (to
£853,047) placed on fixed-deposit with
the group, the rapidly growing hire-
purchase offshoot utilising part of the
funds thus provided to increase its h.-p.
debtors by £590,379 to £2,174,955. The
£164,578 overdraft was eliminated:

To avoid the holding of “tax-paid”
vehicles, three new subsidiaries were
formed during the year, and, as a result,
the £98,569 increase in stock shown in
the balance-sheet may not reflect the
full extent of any stock-accumulation.
Both debtors (down £187,018) and
creditors (down £54,016) fell with the
slower turnover, but the co. ended the
year with £146,980 of cash in hand and
a working-capital of £2,576,018 (up
£369,894).

'T'HE latest balance-sheet from JLUstre is
sad disillusionment indeed for any
shareholder who had imagined that the
co.’s worst troubles were put behind a
term ago.
In spite of action taken in 1955 to
clear excess stocks and to write-down
(by unstated but “substantial” amounts)
the balance of inventories, the co. last
year disclosed losses, after providing
£43,193 (up £2601) depreciation, totalling
£198,734, of which £98,734 appeared as a
debit balance on the profit-and-loss
account, and £lOO,OOO as a transfer from
general reserves, arising specifically from
the need to “fully cover write-down on
obsolete and slow-moving stocks.” Again
no dividend was paid.
In explanation, Lustre’s board says
that sales were “well below” anticipated
levels, and that the stock-revaluation was
carried out on the advice of its business
consultants. If anything, their recom-
mendations went beyond what was
actually necessary.
As a result of their investigation a
thoroughgoing reorganisation of the
business has been undertaken to reduce
production-costs and improve efficiency,
and a return to profitable trading has been
budgeted for this year, though the co.
says that sales so far haven’t come up to
expectations. It is hoped, however, that
the leeway will be made up later on in
the year.
Most of the difficulties encountered in
the last couple of years have followed
upon the change in fashion in women’s
underwear, from rayon- to nylon-made
goods.
Hitherto, Lustre, which had always
been a large producer of rayon lingerie
and fabrics, enjoyed a strong position in
the trade, and shareholders had failed to
receive a dividend only on three occasions
in the preceding quarter-century—in the
depression years after 1929. During the
five years to 1954 the ords. got an average
div. of 11.5 p.c.
The co. has two factories, one in
Sydney and the other at Newcastle, and
there are two subsidiaries, Lustre (N.Z.),
Ltd., and Silktex Pty., both of which
operated at a profit in 1956, though no
dividend was paid to the parent co. In
1955 divs. passed on by the subsidiaries
amounted to £27,840.
In the balance-sheet stocks appeared
£232,960 (approximately 26 p.c.) lower at
£670,389, and book debts at £265,296,
stood £56,454 higher. Of the latter
increase, however, £50,010 is attributable
to an alteration in accounting procedure
involving an earlier closing of the year in
respect of cash receipts. It also helps to
explain why the overdraft is larger:

£1,920,504 £1,873,778 £1,687,878
The overdraft and the drastic stock write-
down notwithstanding, working-capital at
the year’s end was a comfortable
£498,806. Plant is modern and should
not call for any great expenditure.
Lustre has a good record, and the
present reassurances of the board are
welcome, but the sharemarket prefers to
wait and see, and prices the f.-p. £1 scrip
at 11s. (20s. a year ago, and 355. 6d. the
year before that). Net asset cover is

Rockman’s Showrooms. Ltd.
nrERRITORIAL expansion of the
-*■ Rockman’s chain continued last
year, and the 1955-56 term finished with
the co. owning 11 more stores than when
it began, 13 months before on this
occasion, for the balance-date has been
advanced a month to July 31.
The co. now has 76 shops, spread
through all States except W.A., and three
more are shortly to go up. Another four
sites have been bought, but it isn’t
intended to begin building operations
straight away.
Included in last year’s additions were
a number of stores taken over from
Sydney fashion-goods retailer Archer and
Laing Holdings, Ltd. Consideration for
the £200,000 share-capital of the co. was
£50,000 of Rockman’s ord. scrip and
£lOO,OOO cash.
In Melbourne as in Sydney the
emphasis lately has been on expansion
into the suburban retail. centres, where
greater custom is being attracted as
travelling becomes more expensive and
the out-of-town retailer learns to provide
goods of city-quality and -selection. .
Rockman’s has been broadening its
own range of merchandise, handling not
only women’s fashions (the business’s
original but also men’s, boys’ and
girls’ wear, underwear, "hosiery, dress-
materials, millinery and manchester,
mainly in the medium-price field.
At the same time the co. has apparently
decided to vacate the manufacturing
field. Sale of factory plant is mentioned
in last term’s report.
Results for the year were less profit-
able, though because the term was longer
an exact comparison with prior years
isn’t possible:

Because of the work of reorganising the
Archer and Laing business, this section
contributed a net loss. On average ord.
capital the net £204,868 earned, after
taking care of the pref. divs., was 15.8 p.c.
In 1955 the rate was a shade under 18 p.c.
Commensurate with the lower return the
div. was dropped from p.c. to 11 p.c.
(interim 5 p.c., final, for seven months,
6 p.c.).
For the first six months of the current
year sales were slightly below those in the
previous corresponding period, and the
interim div. was lowered to 4 p.c.
To finance net additions of £1,074,771
to fixed assets and £216,011 to current
assets (mostly stock), and to reduce its
trade indebtedness by £205,407, the co.
borrowed an extra £580,519 on mort-
gage, etc., and raised £595,390 new ord.
(£300,000) and pref. (£295,390) share-

The movements strengthened the
working-capital position. When the
books closed the surplus of more-or-less
liquid assets over liabilities was £391,207
stronger at £838,823, and the current
ratio up from 1.32 to 1.69 to 1. Borrowed
money (mainly deferred liabilities)
amounted to just on 21s. for every £ of
shareholders’ funds in the business.
On ’Change the ss. ords. (converted
from 10s. units in May last year) have
slipped to around par since the interim
dividend was announced. At 11s. 6d.
and 18s. each respectively the 5 p.c. prefs.
and the new percenters return 8.7 p.c.
and 8.3 p.c. Net asset cover for the prefs.

nrHE demand for hire-purchase
i accommodation appears to
be levelling out, and for the first
time in nearly a year figures
released by the Acting Common-
wealth Statistician disclose a
reduction in the amount owing
under h.-p. agreements.
Following the expiration, last
June, of the agreement between
the Prime Minister and the
finance cos. (limiting expansion,
etc.) the h.-p. debt grew quickly
and in the six months to
December, ’56, had increased by
£17.7 million compared with an
increase of only £621,000 in the
preceding half-year. February
saw a fall of £321,000 in the
balance outstanding, which, how-
ever, still amounted to a size-
able £229.5 million at the end
of the month. Bank-advances at
the same date totalled £919
million.
The value of plant and
machinery acquired under hire-
purchase increased sharply after
repayment-terms were relaxed,
and, although there has been a
subsequent decline in the number
of new agreements, it would
appear that the h.-p. cos. are
benefiting from the restraints on
bank-lending to an extent that
would justify criticism of the
situation.
Recent legislation providing
for stamp-tax on agreements and,
in N.S.W., limitation of interest-
rates should not trouble the
stronger h.-p. cos., which are
more likely to be affected by a
general reduction in consumer-
spending. Although funds are
still being sought from the public,
the flood of debenture- and note-
issues has abated, and repay-
ments are now financing a larger
proportion of new transactions.
The Sydney-based Mutual
Acceptance is primarily interested
in financing the purchase of
durable household goods, a class
of business where finance covers
a relatively high (average 80 p.c.)
of the total cost, but the in-
dividual initial debt is small,
usually in the vicinity of £BO.
Formed in 1936, the Mutual
Acceptance and its operating
subsidiary, Martin Acceptance,
operate only in N.S.W.
Extending over a period of
changing interest - rates, a
£2,375,000 debenture - issue
(carrying rights to take-up scrip
at par in Dec., ’5B) closed late
last year with the public section
a little better than half-full. A
subsequent £200,000 note-issue
offering 8, 9 and 10 p.c. for three,
five and seven years respectively
was “entirely successful,” over-
subscriptions bringing the pro-
ceeds to £515,000.
The co. has a paid capital of
£1,009,505, £866,250 in ss. ords.
and £186,000 in 5 p.c. and 6
p.c. £1 prefs. A .subsidiary owns
all but 42,745 of the prefs. Early
in the current term pref. share-
holders, in both the parent and
the subsidiary, were invited to
convert their holdings, at market
values, into 7 p.c. debentures.
Last term (to June 30) the
group turnover increased by
£68,600 to £4,123,300, but net
earnings were reduced by higher
expenses and salaries, and by the
end of the period fund-raising
was more difficult and costly.
After making unstated provision
for taxation and depreciation
and allowing for outside
interests, a net profit of £180,532
was claimed, a fall of £23,641:

sible for the main balance-sheet
movements, a £310,689 drop in
creditors resulting from the con-
version of a £300,000 loan (from
the M.L.C.) into debenture stock.
The co. has agreed to reduce its
overdraft by an amount equal
to 20 p.c. of the public subscrip-
tion to the debenture issue, but
at the end of the year the co.
owed the bank £661,032, an
increase of £110,720 over the

F. W. Williams Holdings
AN excellent first year by
F. W. Williams as a public
concern. After setting aside
£4834 for depreciation and
£18,053 for income tax, and
excluding the interests of out-
side shareholders, parent and
subsidiaries turned in a net profit
for the year to December 31 of
£92,492. That was £5853 better
than the preceding term and
£19,772 above the average
annual profit claimed in the
selling-brokers’ memorandum
for the period 1953 to 1955.
As a percentage on the holding
co.’s £350,000 capital it was
26.4 p.c., compared with 24.7
p.c., 22.9 p.c. and 14.7 p.c. over
the same three years. A 10 p.c.
div. absorbed £35,000.
The co. was originally formed
in 1918 as F. W. Williams and
Co. Pty., to take over the farm-
and-station supply business of
F. W. Williams and Co. Its
head-office is in Sydney, and five
branches are located in different
country centres, handling a range
of farming requirements, includ-
ing fencing-materials, farm-
machinery, veterinary lines, etc.
In 1932 the co. entered into
partnership with American
Reinforced Paper Co. to establish
the Sisalkraft industry in Aus-
tralia. Two cos. have been
formed, Sisalkraft Co. Pty., to
undertake manufacture, and
Sisalkraft Distributors Pty.,
which took over distribution
from F. W. Williams in 1952.
Details of the capital
reorganisation that took place
on formation of the holding co.
aren’t available, but the 700,000
10s. stock units issued in
exchange for the proprietary’s
scrip started off with a net
tangible asset cover of about
11s. lOd. The figure is now
14s. 2d., based on a very con-
servative balance-sheet. All fixed
assets are entered at cost, less
depreciation, investments at cost,
and stock at cost or market, less
an unspecified reserve.
Altogether the financial set-up
is a very pleasing one, and,
attracted by prospects, the
market is prepared to pay 21s. 9d.
for the scrip for an immediate
return of only 4.6 p.c. on a 10
p.c. div. basis.
Pacific Mining, Ltd.
pACIFIC MINING, LTD.,
-®- reaped little benefit from
its recent search for rutile on
the north coast of N.S.W. The
testing-team was in the field for
nine months and located one
deposit “rich enough to warrant
the erection of a treatment-
plant.” This discovery was
announced at the last annual
meeting, but the Mines Depart-
ment has ruled that work in the
area (near Forster) would be
“inimical to public interest.” The
minerals in some areas tested by
the co. have been sold to an
“operating co.” on a £5-per-
ton royalty basis and a return
from the transaction is expected
this year.
The testing-team has now been
disbanded, and the co.’s share-
holding in Coffs Harbor Rutile,
N.L., remains its chief rutile
interest.
Pacific Mining holds 60,000 of
the 1,270,500 ss. shares issued
by Coffs Harbor Rutile, and
will receive a royalty of £1 per
ton on rutile produced by that
co. from certain leases in the
Coffs Harbor and Clarence
River areas. (Coffs Harbor
Rutile is expected to commence
production within the next
month or so, and the first ship-
ment of rutile, sold under
forward contracts, is due to be
made next July.)
Formed as Pacific Uranium
and Oil Syndicate, Ltd., in 1954
the co. holds oil-prospecting
leases in Queensland and Vic-
toria, early attempts to locate
uranium in commercial quan-
tities being unsuccessful. Invest-
ments include 21,800 ss. shares
in Nickel Mines of Australia,
N.L., a co. of which little has
been heard over the last year or
so.
Paid capital, £54,500, was
originally in £5 shares, but these
were split into f.-p. ss. shares in
1955. Buyers are currently
offering Bd. for the scrip.
Larut Tin Fields, Ltd.
'T'HE directors of Larut Tin
Fields, Ltd., have recom-
mended that £lBO,OOO of the
co.’s £300,000 paid capital (3s.
per ss. share) be returned to
shareholders. (All figures are
in sterling.) As forecast by the
board two years ago, the No. 4
dredge ran out of work at the
end of 1956, and in view of the
age and capacity of this dredge it
is unlikely that an economic use
can be found for it.
Larut Tin Fields is a member
of the Anglo-Oriental group of
Malayan tin-mines and operates
in the State of Perak. In 1939
the co. owned five dredges, but
only two survived the war, one
of which is the No. 4 dredge.
It has been estimated that the
remaining dredge will be operat-
ing for almost another nine
years.
For most of last term (to
December 31, ’56) both dredges
were working, and 965 tons of
tin concentrates were produced,
against the previous term’s
989.4 tons (including 75.4 tons
from residual ore):

The tin-content of the con-

(74.5 p.c., against 74.7 p.c.) and
equalled 719.15 tons (down 20
tons) of metallic tin, but the
average price obtained rose from
£717 13s. 3d. to £755 3s. Id. per
ton. Proceeds from tin-sales'
amounted to £543,068, an in-
crease of £12,572. Higher operat-
ing- and overhead expenses (up
£9403), an extra £2275 in
Malayan export-duty (£82,710),
and a heavier charge for deple-
tion and depreciation (up
£12,382 to £74,675) reduced pre-
tax earnings by £5926 to
£162,638. However, tax was
estimated at £26,000, or £lB,OOO
less than in the preceding term,
leaving net profit £11,095
stronger at £136,636 after allow-
ing for a £977 adjustment relat-
ing to the ’55 term.
The co. finished the year with
current assets of £602,653 (in-
cluding £471,726 in cash) and
liabilities of £100,332. Fixed-
assets, less provisions for de-
pletion and depreciation, were
in the balance-sheet at £64,568,
the depletion provision, after'
writing-off (£203,780) the Tai-
ping township area and transfer-
ring £75,000 from property
reserve, totalling £555,000. The
International Tin Agreement
(aimed at stabilising tin-prices)
came into operation in July of
last year, and the co.’s contribu-
tion to the “buffer” stock, set-up
under the agreement, is in the
accounts at £6816.
Divs. of Is. 3d. (stg.) and 2s.
(stg.) per share were paid in
September, ’56, and March, ’57,
respectively and are subject to a
30 p.c. Malayan tax. Sellers are
asking 10s. 9d. for the scrip.
The prospecting partnership
formed by King Island Scheelite
(1947), Ltd., Loloma (Fiji) Gold

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Zealand’s total imports
in the . 12 months to March
31 fell by only £1 million, from
the level of the previous year.
Private imports were cut by
£8 million as a result of the
credit-squeeze, but Govern-
ment imports rose by £7
million.
At £264 million the total still
seems high, but official state-
ments indicate that the Govern-
ment considers that existing
measures provide adequate
control of the situation. .
Australia’s recent action in
lifting the ceiling on imports
brought a prompt statement
that N.Z. did not intend to
follow suit, did not, in fact,
need to do so, because cuts in
force here were not nearly so
drastic as those which had been
imposed in Australia.
Now allegations that various
items are quietly being brought
back under control as a first
step in a return to a planned
economy have been denied.
The fact is that, since the
Board of Trade inquiries
began in 1950, the number
of named items under import-
control has fallen from 950 to
273.
Credit and Imports
The suggestion that a greater
measure of direct . import-
control may become necessary
to protect employment for a
rapidly growing population is
answered by the fact that the
overwhelming proportion of
N.Z.’s imports consists of raw
materials and plant for local
industries, which have
expanded their production by
30 per cent, in recent years.
The Government has ex-
pressed its belief that, while
quantitative restrictions may be
necessary for some years to
protect fledgling industries and
industries in need of reorganisa-
tion and re-equipment, others
should be able to compete with
imports under tariffs which
take into account differences in
costs of raw materials and wage
and living standards.
Regulation of the general
level of imports by credit-
restraint rather than by the
handout of licences on an
arbitrary basis by Government
departments has been welcomed
by retailers, who consider that
it has enabled the consumer’s
needs to be met with greater
satisfaction. In this they
certainly have the support of
most consumers.
Wool Prices—
High wool prices are going
to be the dominant factor in
the N.Z. economy this year,
though they have not yet been
reflected in official figures for
export receipts. For the 12
months to March 31 wool
receipts were £97.9 million,
against £98.4 million in the
previous 12 months.
At recent sales average prices
have been running about 27
p.c. above last year’s level.
With the selling season now in
its final quarter, there is every
indication that strong and
buoyant demand will be
sustained, according to the
N.Z. Wool Board.
A feature of the marketing
season has been that prices
have been supported by the
well-spread demand of one of
the widest benches of buyers
seen in post-war years.
During the first three* months
of the year, which comprise the
third quarter of the selling-
season, values moved within
relatively narrow margins and
showed remarkable stability in
spite of a succession of inter-
national crises which tended to
hamper trade and commerce,
—And Butter
The effects of depressed
butter prices are showing up
plainly in the monthly overseas
exchange figures. For the 12
months to March 31 receipts
for butter exports were £43.3
million,'* against £5O million in
the previous 12 months.
According to the governor
of the Reserve Bank, Mr. E.
C. Fussell, however, N.Z.
should not worry unduly
about the drop in the price of
its butter. “It’s just one of
the troubles which N.Z.’s
dynamic economy must
expect,” he said. He went even
further to describe the fall as
“possibly a blessing in dis-
guise.” N.Z. did have a ten-
dency to price itself out of
overseas markets, he said, and
there was nothing like a fall
in prices to bring a country
back to reality.
Meantime, the question of
the guaranteed price to be paid
internally for dairy produce
in the coming season is the
subject of keen speculation.
The price will be fixed by the
recently created Dairy Pro-
ducts Prices Authority, which
is required to consider: The
necessity of maintaining the
stability and efficiency of the
industry, the cost of produc-
tion, the amount the produce
is realising, the ruling level
of other farm products, the
cost of marketing the produce,
recommendations of the Dairy
Board and anything else rele-
vant.
Interest centres on the basic
cost - of - production factor,
which includes an amount
representing the dairyfarmer’s
remuneration, and which will
be determined by a working
committee consisting of
members of the Government
and the Dairy Board.
Frozen Foods
N.Z.’s frozen-foods industry
will soon be worth £5 million
a year in revenue from exports,
according to the Minister of
Industries and Commerce, Mr.
Halstead. “We are on the eve
of significant and spectacular
developments in the field of
frozen foods,” he said.
Substantial shipments of
frozen vegetables have already
been made to Australia from
Hastings and Nelson. Three
Australian businessmen,
recently in N.Z. on a buying
mission, said they believed
there was every possibility of
a considerable trade being built
up. The market for deep-
frozen foods was expanding
rapidly.
The spokesman for a Nelson
company said recently that the
Australian Government was
granting import-licences only
to Australian processors. It
was not as satisfactory as deal-
ing with Australian brokers or
distributors, who had to handle
the goods eventually. It has also
been pointed out that Aus-
tralia’s 25 per cent.. exchange-
rate acts as a tariff. The fact
that N.Z. has been able to
open a market in spite of this
disadvantage speaks well for
the efficiency of the industry.
Birds Eye Foods (N.Z.), Ltd.,
a subsidiary of Lever Brothers
(N.Z.), Ltd., has announced
that its new Hastings factory,
costing £310,000 for buildings
and plant, is expected to be in
production by November, and
that it hopes to export
£358,000-worth of frozen foods
this year and to increase this
amount by £300,000 in 1958.
Two other companies
actively interested in the
frozen-foods industry, Tip Top
Ice Cream Co. (Auckland),
Ltd., and J. Wattie Canneries,
Ltd., after considering a merger
proposal, have shelved it in
favor of closer trading
arrangements, which, it is
claimed, will be of assistance
to both of them.
Forestry •
Prime Minister Holland sees
forestry as another great
primary industry and an
eventual major contributor to
N.Z.’s prosperity. He told the
annual conference of the
Australian Pulp and Paper
Technical Association at
Rotorua that there was an
early prospect of the industry’s
earning £35 million in over-
seas exchange and that full
development could double that
figure.
Before he left for overseas
to investigate forest-manage-
ment techniques and modern
equipment, Sir David Henry,
Forest Products’ chairman,
said that, in the year to March
31, his company had contri-
buted more than £6 million to
N.Z.’s balance of payments
through export earnings and
import savings.
Most of the exports were to
Australia and represented a
quarter of N.Z.’s total exports
to that country. In addition,
pulp had been sold to Britain,
South Africa, India and Japan.
During the year 1957-58 the
company expects to produce
65,000 tons of pulp and is
installing a bleaching plant to
produce a greater variety of
pulps and papers. The capacity
of the kraft-paper machine is
also being extended.
Factors currently having an
adverse effect on Australian
imports of N.Z. softwoods
were discussed by M r - O. D.
A. Oberg, charter president of
the Tim be r Development
Association of Australia, when
on a visit to Mac*iland.
The most important were
accumulation of stocks, a
temporary recession in home-
building and comparatively
high shipping-freights between
the two countries, he said.
There was no reason why the
market for Pinus radiata
should not constantly expand
once some features of the
existing situation had dis-
appeared.


PENSIONS AND NEEDS
TTOW to look after the old people of
the community has been a problem
that has confronted all societies in all
ages. It is generally accepted that there
is a moral obligation on the workers and
earners of the community to provide for
those who through age and infirmity are
no longer able to provide for themselves.
The degree to which this responsibility
is accepted by the family, the group or
by society in general varies considerably
in different countries and at different
times, but basically the determining
factor is economic.
In a simple community it is plain to
everyone that the only way the aged non-
producers can be given more is by the
producers producing more or keeping
a little less for themselves. Unfortunately
this is not quite so obvious in a complex
modern society, particularly in the
Welfare State where the “giving” is done
by an impersonal Government depart-,
ment in the form of cash payments
unrelated to production. In these circum-
stances the principle of more for pen-
sioners meaning less for someone else is
often lost sight of.
Once politics comes into the picture
it is difficult to keep the subject of
pensions clear of emotionalism and senti-
mentality. Pensioners, like other classes
and age-groups in the community, come
in all shapes. They include people who
have been hardworking all their lives and
people who have been lazy and shiftless ;
those who have had money and have lost
it and those who have never enjoyed any
real prosperity at all; good and bad;
pleasant and ill-natured ; deserving and
undeserving. Yet in the style of oratory
favored by Labor M.P.s at election-time
or Budget-time this diverse group of
people, simply because they are pen-
sioners, become transformed into “sturdy
old pioneers.”
This is nonsense. The working-life of
today’s man of 70 didn’t begin until the
twentieth century was already here, and
Australia’s real pioneering period was
over by then. Pioneering isn’t just a
matter of growing old. There are young
men in their twenties today doing pioneer-
ing work and there are old men in their
nineties who have never aspired to
pioneer anything more than a short-cut
to the corner pub. Pensioners are not
all sturdy pioneers. But they are all
elderly people who, for a variety of
reasons, mostly beyond their control, are
no longer able to provide for themselves.
Unfortunately for those whose respon-
sibility it is to evolve a fair and equitable
pensions-system the needs of the pen-
sioners are not uniform, a fact that seems
often to be overlooked by many of those
who raise the parrot-cry “What about
the pensioners?” at the drop of a hat.
Professor R. I. Downing, of the
Economics Faculty at the University of
Melbourne, is one who has been giving
serious thought to the whole question of
age-pensions, and he has published a
pamphlet, Raising Age Pensions, embody-
ing some conclusions reached in discus-
sion with some of his colleagues at the
University. In these discussions, he says,
they had in mind “on the one hand the
acute needs of some pensioners and on
the other the importance of adding as
little as possible, in a time of inflationary
pressure, to Commonwealth Government
expenditure.”
Most advocates of higher pensions
completely ignore the expenditure side of
the problem or dismiss it as unimportant.
It is, however, most important. An
increase of, say, £lO million in pensions is
not just a fiat payment made once and
for all. It is a continuing annual levy on
the Treasury. More than that, it is an
increasing annual levy, as the number of
pensioners is growing yearly and will
continue to grow for many years to
come. It was pointed out by a former
Minister for Social Services in the Budget
debate last year that the number of age-
pensioners is increasing at the rate of
20,000 a year, so that without any increase
at all in the rate of pensions the annual
bill rises by £4 million each year.
The Downing Plan
The Downing plan starts with the
assumption that the Government may be
contemplating adding 10s. a week to the
pension-rate in the next Budget—at a
cost of £l2 million a year. No additions
were made to the pension-rate last year,
but in 1955 a 10s.-rise was granted, at a
cost of about £lO million, , and in 1954
various easings in the means-test involved
a similar amount. Presumably these
figures and the fact that widows’ and
invalid pensions received the attention of
the Treasurer in the last Budget influ-
enced the professor’s assumptions for
this year.
We shall suggest other bases for distri-
buting this money, which we believe would
concentrate the benefits where they are
most needed. We believe that this is the -
minimum sum which should be spent. If
the Government is willing to spare more
from other possible uses of the money, then
it may be possible both to meet special
needs along the lines we suggest and to
raise the basic pension-rate. If it is not
willing even to spend this much, then it is all
the more important that such additional
benefits as are paid should be concentrated
on the most urgent needs.
Instead of 10s. a week all round the
professor wants first attention to be given
to pensioners who are living alone, for
whom an important problem is “the
inability to share overhead costs of hous-
ing, heating and lighting which, for two
people, should be much less than twice
the cost for one person.” He recom-
mends that all such pensioners should
be given an extra 7s. 6d. a week, at a
Budget cost of £5 million.
Pointing out that, whereas in the case
of a married couple, both pensioners, the
allowable income without reduction of
pension is £7 a week, making a total
household income of £l5 a week, the
allowable income is still only £7 a week
where only one of the couple is a pen-
sioner, the pamphlet continues, “We
suggest that, in such cases, allowable
income should be increased by the
amount of pension to which the other
party would be entitled if of pension-
able age”:—■
Our present pension-rate, especially if
supplemented as suggested for households
with only one pensioner, is fairly generous
in view of the exemption from means-
test of an owner-occupied house and of the
size of the income allowed from earnings
and annuities. But the position of individual
pensioners varies so greatly that it is surely
impossible to provide, by a single rate of
pension, a reasonable minimum standard for
all without giving extravagantly much to
some. We believe that it is absolutely
essential, and the most important of possible
improvements, that special assistance should
be given to pensioners who can demonstrate
need.
Since the Department of Social
Services already collects information
about pensioners’ income and property
the professor considers it would involve
little extra administrative effort to pay a
special assistance grant “to those who,
say, neither own their own home nor
have more than 10s. a week from other
sources of income.” Special assistance
could also be given to those who can
demonstrate a need for special diets,
medical attention, domestic assistance
and so on ; also to those who receive a
reduced pension, or are debarred
altogether, on account of a property-
holding which does not yield an adequate
income, or which it might not be possible
to dispose of. All this, the professor
estimates, might cost £34- million, allow-
ing an average of an extra 10s. a week
to 1.40,000 persons.
The pamphlet further suggests that
housing-allowances should be paid to
pensioners who can show need ; these
could be p-aid to assist house-owners
with rates, interest-payments and main-
tenance, as well as to help those paying
rent. The amount suggested for this
purpose is £2} million, enough to give an
average housing-allowance of 10s. a week
to nearly 100,000 persons. A start
towards housing pensioners has been
made by the Aged Persons Homes Act,
but the professor would like to see an
effort to stimulate more energetic action
by State and local-government bodies
and by private organisations. He
believes the Federal Government has
ample financial power to do this through
conditional grants-in-aid.
Professor Downing’s pamphlet is a
conscientious attempt to make practical
suggestions for improving the lot of
those pensioners most in need of help.
He makes no claim that his calculations
are exact; in fact, he points out the
difficulty of getting adequate informa-
tion to give a complete picture of the
position and suggests that a proper
survey should be carried out by' trained
workers. There can be little quarrel with
his main contention that whatever extra
money is available for expenditure on
age-pensions should be devoted to
alleviating the hardship of those who
need it most rather than in the more
politically popular expedient of giving
a flat-rate handout to all pensioners
irrespective of their relative needs.

A the last 16 year* startling mineral discoveries have been made, snch as uranium and bauxite in Queensland

From Some Essays on Fishing
THE TOWN CREEK
By DOUGLAS STEWART
THE Town Creek, so far
as I ever knew, was too
humble to have any
other name.
Sometimes I used to believe,
never having properly tramped
its course downstream, that
south of the town it became
that dark and sluggish rivulet
called Taipo Creek, meaning
the Devil’s ; but that, though
a famous place for eels, where
my father, trying out a new
cuttyhunk line, thin and
immensely strong, once pulled
out the father of all eels (which
turned into a slimy black log
when it broke the surface), was
an unpleasant piece of water.
I would not be surprised if
Taipo Creek had originally
been dug as a ditch to drain
the low-lying farms, as other
great ditches, also tenanted by
eels which the farmers some-
times speared with pitchforks,
had been dug across the
Ngaere Swamp by gangs of
alarming immigrants, Austrians
or Dalmatians.
It was not in the Town
Creek’s nature to connect itself
with a drain ; for, though it
ran between grassy banks
without the shingly rapids and
sandy beaches of the other
Taranaki rivers, it was a pure
and merry water.
More likely, instead of
becoming Taipo Creek, it was
the streamlet that joined the
Waingongoro a few miles
down from Eltham where
Neale-road ended in the swing-
bridge—a perilous contraption
which in childhood we de-
lighted to set swinging above
the current and where
George Batchelor, a wonderful
fisherman who worked for
Peebles, the grocer, cast fly or
minnow with rare skill far and
flat-wise under the green arches
of the willows —often enough
to take a six-pounder.
In spite of the big fish, some
of the best ever taken in
Taranaki, I did not often
explore those waters. I never
could fish as well as George
Batchelor ; and though I think
I could probably do as well
as my friend Fin Maslin, the
carrier’s son, who also caught
big fellows down there, the
difficulty of the long casts
under the branches, combined
with a dislike for the sombre-
ness of the waters that never
really saw the sunlight as they
tunnelled through the tall wet
grass under the willows,
usually sent me upstream for
my delight.
I preferred both the Town
Creek and the Waingongoro
north of Eltham, where they
sparkled through open country,
and where, though the fish
were smaller, you could always
see the mountain, its high peak
white with snow.
Where you met the Town
Creek in town it was engaged
in crossing Bridge-street,
prudently avoiding the traffic
under a stone causeway. There
were old wooden railings, grey
with wisdom and warm with
sunlight, on which you could
lean and ponder.
Tom Stanners, a tall,
straight-backed pioneer whom
I interviewed for the Eltham
“Argus” when they pulled
down a weatherbeaten smithy
that stood or, rather,
staggered—near by, told me
that bullock-wagons splashed
across a ford there on their way
to town in the early days . . .
but it is astonishing how little
any of us ever knew or cared
about how there came to be a
ford and a bridge and a town
at Eltham; who first came
there from England, so far
across the sea, pushing and
chopping their way through
the dense green bush and
braving the resentment of the
Maoris, who, though they
never seem to have lived or
fought much around Eltham,
were pretty fierce at Hawera,
only 12 miles away, and slew
the great guerrilla-fighter Von
Tempsky at Te-Ngutu-o-te-
Manu (“The Beak of the
Bird”).
Our own immediate affairs
obsessed us. Just above the
bridge, for instance, the
Borough Council in my time
tidied the banks of the Town
Creek and made a pretty little
park of it.
It was called Bridger Park,
after the Mayor: a gentleman
with long black hair, which he
used to toss back from his
forehead in a way that fas-
cinated me in childhood,
named—in what I always
thought the most exotic style
—lra J. Bridger. He kept a
bicycle-shop and belonged to
the Salvation Army.
Once Mr. Bridger and a
citizen very dear to us all fell
out upon the Post Office steps
over, I believe, the Borough
Estimates ; and came to fisti-
cuffs, and afterwards sued and
counter-sued each other in the
little local courthouse. And
that was the kind of thing that,
rather than the dim and
improbable feats of the
pioneers, engaged our most
ardent sympathies.
Though Bridger Park is a
tranquil and enchanting little
spot, and from the railings of
the bridge you can now see
the trout swimming tantalis-
ingly in the tidied water, the
Town Creek had at that point
a somewhat disreputable repu-
tation: such is the effect, even
on the purest of waters, of
contact with the metropolis.
Our metropolis had a popu-
lation of about 2000 ; but even
there the most surprising things
used to happen. A farmer put
gelignite into the oven to blow
up his relatives ; a respectable
citizen crept round by night
and stole ladies’ underwear
from thdir clothes-lines; an
Assyrian in Bath-street, heated
by love, belabored his rival
with a dog-chain ; a wild man
put a notice on his house
“Beware of the Lion’s Cub”;
there were fires, even murders ;
and just downstream from
Bridger Park, the wildest of
wild Irishmen started to dig
a tunnel which led under the
Bank of New South Wales,
where he proposed to blow-up
the strongroom—a large and
mighty venture, so it loomed
in our childhood, opening the
door to a world of power and
desperation beyond anything
we had dreamed of.
The attempt failed, so our
legend ran, because an accom-
plice got drunk one night and
talked too much to the black-
smith, who told the police.
Some years later, when he
re-entered society, we used to
see the tunneller, huge, gaunt,
raw-boned and red, stalking
about the streets of the town,
so wonderful and terrible and
utterly removed from the
normal life of man that we
hardly dared to look at him ;
but, of course, from a safe
distance, did.
He disappeared again after
a little while, and we never
saw him again ; but the Town
Creek remembers his face.
The other crime done near
the same spot, where the creek
took a turn round a boulder
and vanished under willows,
was milder and much less out-
landish. It was there that two
small boys—of whom I was
not one, I hasten to say—
speared a 101 b. brown trout
and could not refrain, so mag-
nificent was the pri?e, from
boasting about it
In fact, they had it displayed
in the window of the fish-shop
for the admiration of the
whole town on the great Satur-
day-night shopping-carnival.
Constable Townsend also


admired it; and those two
gallant young poachers found
themselves up before the
magistrate.
For half-a-mile or so above
these scenes of depravity the
Town Creek did something
utterly mysterious with itself
in waters which, for some
reason or other, I never
explored; I daresay it flowed
through people’s backyards.
But at last, when it emerged
behind the Presbyterian
Church away up on the right
bank, passed Fred Vincent’s
backyard and the Convent
high up on the left, and wound
its shining way over the little
stones and through the green
paddocks to the bridge on the
way to Chiselhurst, there
began the regions of delight.
It was there that, wagging
it from Miss Hooper’s private
school one day (wonderful
Miss Hooper, who had once
been a missionary in India and
had been chased down a dark
street by a black man bent on
love) I met the wild gang
from the Public School, also
playing the wag, sunburnt
crimson and swimming all the
glorious long day in the deep
green pool where the diving-
board poked out its wooden
tongue under the willows.
It was there that, when I
first began to fish, I hooked my
friend lan Wylds, the bank-
manager’s son, in the eyelid
—for he was standing behind
me when I cast —and, believ-
ing he was blinded for life, he
refused to be unhooked and
ran roaring for home, with
me after him with the rod,
playing him like the noblest
trout I ever had on the line.
It was there that, years later,
when Taranaki’s tremendous
rains had brought the Waiau
or the Mangahume up in
sudden flood, Fin Maslin and
I sometimes retreated to carry
on with the day’s fishing,
dropping our ignoble worms
into the waters that would still
run clear, though brimming
full, in the small round pools
or shallow runnels under the
encroaching watercress.
It was there that, too late
after work to get to the
Waingongoro, I sometimes
walked with my mother to fish
the evening rise, seldom with
more than a dark and rather
slimy one-pounder for my bag,
but with a. keen pleasure in
becoming expert at finding the
nests of skylarks as they shot
up suddenly from the long
grass at our feet, leaving the
cup in the ground and the four
brown speckled eggs (con-
taining what skyfuls of song!)
still warm from their shelter-
ing breasts.
How we loved that mile or
so of rivulet all the days of
our lives, from the last time I
saw the skylarks’ nests to days
so far back into childhood that
seeking to recapture them now
is like looking into another
world, like peering at algae
through a microscope, like
watching some speck of life in
one of the stream’s own
hastening bubbles!
Dimly I see in that bubble
a tiny splash. It was the day
my sister’s friend fell into that
enormous pool under the grey
boulder and, so we thought,
Was drowning.
How we rescued her, I know
not; but Ido indelibly remem-
ber that we had with us that
day a billycart—or it may even
have been a perambulator—
and afterwards, all the way
home down Mountain-road,
that heroic and adorable little
girl had her small blue
bloomers drying on the back
of it . . . and was walking,
without them, in heaven knows
what pink twinkling. I should
be distressed to think that
memory was merely rude: in
the tiny bubble of that day I
had seen for the first time,
stark in the crystal depths, the
two great mysteries of our
existence, Death and Love.
That was,, too, one of the
days when, besides playing in
the Town Creek, we peered
once more into that third and
all - encompassing mystery,
Nature herself lurking in “The
Caves”; for we never failed,
on visits to the stream, to
pause and wonder at those two
most romantic cavities in the
clay bank ... a hundred yards
or so up from the Creek on the
hillside known as Crabtree’s
Dip, because Mr. Crabtree, the
publican, had once hurled his
car through the wooden fence
on Mountain Road there.
I think The Caves, in the
years before we knew them,
must have been quarries of
some kind; perhaps someone
had dug them out for clay.
But why? There was clay
everywhere, the yellow vol-
canic deposit from prehistoric
eruptions of Mount Egmont,
blanketing the whole province
a foot or so under the rich
black soil of leaf-mould from
the forests cut down by the
pioneers.
Why dig two caves in a bank
beside a swampy hollow, away
down the slope from the road,
when you could have all the
clay you wanted on the hill-
top?
There Was no gold or coal in
the neighborhood to dig for ;
no stone suitable for building ;
and all the road-metal anyone
could require came from the
shingle in the Waingongoro,
where Maslins had their
crusher, or from the shell-
rock at Mangamingi, where
cockles and pipis swam in the
wild ridges of mud.
Perhaps someone excavated
them to clear and imprison the
tiny spring that, dripping in
notes of cold and crystalline
music from the green ferns in
the gloom, still filled one of
them with dark water: a drink-
ing-supply for cattle or for
some settler’s hut long since
rotted into the earth.
But why do that, when the
Creek was only a hundred
yards away?
And there was no sign what-
ever of a hut, not even the
chimney of clay or stone or
brick that usually lives on after
bushfire or decay to mark the
hearth of the settler.
Sometimes we thought they
were Maori caves; but the
Maoris had never lived at
Eltham, so far as we knew ; m
and never lived in caves, any-
how.
These puzzles pleased and
haunted us ; and so, most of
all, did the strange stone head,
rounded and slimy, with water
trickling over its forehead and
dripping from its nose as,
embedded in the clay of the far
bank, out of reach across the
pool, it stared at us with mossy
eyes through the ferns.
Was it a Maori carving? So
we told ourselves; and never
quite believed what we said,
Was it a skull? We hoped so.
Was it just a stone? Probably ;
but that was unthinkable. It
was the Earth itself looking at
us ; and we looked back.
And that certainly was true,
Children who have the supreme
good fortune to grow up in
country towns, as we did,
live with the earth like rabbits:
squelching through the rusty
mud of the swamp at the Rifle
Range, watching the pukekos
and the swamprails ; burrow-
ing through the thorny tunnels
of the barberry at Jossie Mills’s,
where blackbirds and thrushes
nested; fishing for butcher-
bees with a straw which we
poked down their holes in a
clay-bank on a sunny Saturday
morning—in the earth and of
the earth for ever.
There was one shining, trans-
cendent day at the Town Creek
when, long before I began to
fish, I first truly made acquaint-
ance with earth in its purest
element of water. I had vowed
to myself to walk that lovely
stream the whole way from the
pool where the diving-board
was to the bridge on the road
to Chiselhurst, not tamely on
the banks where anyone could
walk but in the water all the
time, never once setting foot
on dry land ; and at last I did
it.
How can one recapture in
words the prolonged and
sparkling bliss of such a day?
The sun shone on the snowy
peak and massive blue slopes
of Mount Egmont on the
horizon. The sky was filled
with skylarks, fluttering their
little dark wings and shower-
ing their melody for miles over
the green countryside.. The
paddocks were lit by the
golden constellations of
dandelions. A hare, likely
enough, ran with ears flattened,
doing its best to look invisible,
through the purple clover of
the hayfield. There must have
been cows somewhere —from
which one felt safe in the water
—the delicate fawn Jerseys that
are everywhere in the dairy-
lands of Taranaki.
But these are details observed
later, superimposed on the
memory of that day. And so
would be the tussocks and the
rushes, the stray patch of
blackberry in a gully, the toi-
tois waving their silver plumes
in the clump by the bridge, and
even the distinctive character
of the stream itself: its small-
ness, its clarity, its mats of
watercress, its beach of hoof-
marked mud where the cows
crossed, its midges and crimson
dragonflies, its runnels, its
pools and its little bubbling
,music.
Somehow all these things
must have blended to make

told you before, dear, this is
India where the buses don’t

hotels. And if we have a taxi
we may as well have a
porter. Anyhow, the poor
blighters grab your bag. But
the moment we get to the hotel
I’ll start showing these Indians
the meaning of democracy. I’ll
carry the bags up to the room.
You wait and see.”
But as the taxi glided
towards the steps in front of
the hotel, Howell saw he would
have competition for the bag.
Three bearers were pacing up
and down on the veranda.
Behind them, in a European
suit, stood the manager.
Howell’s heart sank.
As soon as the car stopped
he jumped out, dropping his
pamphlet as he did so, stuffed
the cherrywood hurriedly into
his coat-pocket, bumped his
shins on the rear.bumper-bar,
wrenched the case out of the
boot —all this before the bearer
had reached the car. The
manager then held out his
hands to greet Howell, and
while they were shaking hands
and arranging for Howell to
sign the visitor’s book a bearer
took the case and walked off
to the lift with it . . .
Just before they entered the
dining-room after their bath
Howell hissed to Val, “If you
will insist on talking about
money the whole time, make
damn’ sure you only take food
or drink from one waiter . .
One man brought the soup.
Val said she liked his turban,
but Howell felt so besieged that
he dared not look the man in'
the face, and- felt angry with
Val for expecting him to
behave as though everything
was normal. A second waiter
asked whether the sahib and
the memsahib would like fish,
and when the fifth waiter
brought the coffee Howell had
found the explanation which
absolved him from personal
responsibility:
“It’s all the consequence of
concealed unemployment, dear.
When you pay a tip to these
waiters, and we’ll be paying
five tomorrow —think of it, five
—it’s not really a tip, it’s an
unemployment-benefit, a tax
for welfare. But don’t worry,
there won’t be any of that
nonsense on the Ganges
tomorrow. We’ll have to hire
a boat to go out on the river,
but, by Jove, I’ll row it myself.
I don’t want slaves to row me
about; and, as you say, we
can’t afford them. We’ll tell
them I’m just a simple boy
from the bush, not a sahib.”
'T'HE next morning after
-* breakfast they met their
guide, a dapper little man with
sunglasses, neatly-pressed
tropical suit, and a spotless
white shirt. If you asked a
question the reply was like a
school-lesson, with a striking
introduction, development of
theme, and recapitulation. As
soon as they were seated in the
car the guide began:
“In Hindu religion cities are
associated with gods. So city-
of Banaras is associated with
the Lord Siva. Today I show
you city of Banaras, sacred
Hindu city of Siva. People
ask: Why is Banaras sacred
for Siva? I tell you answer.
In Hindu mythology Siva lives
in Himalaya, mountains, on
roof of world. So Siva has
bathed in water of Ganga
river which come from
Himalayas. If a man bathes in
Holy Ganga, he is bathed by
god Siva, he is washed clean,
sins, everything, purified by
Ganga. Today 1 show you
people bathing in Ganga . . .
And why do people throw
ashes of. dead persons into
Ganga? I tell you”
When the guide paused to
take breath Howell whispered
to Val rather hoarsely:
“Now’s your chance to tell
him who ,we are. Tell him
we’re democrats. Tell him I’m
not a sahib, I’m just a simple
boy from the bush.”
They both leant forward on
their seats.
“I suppose most of your
work is,with Americans?”
Like most Australians in
Asia, Howell and Val disowned
the English and Americans.
They thought that as Aus-
tralians they had a right to
disown the Americans and the
English, to pose as the
innocents, as not responsible
for the behavior of the English
or the Americans. They hoped
that this would make it possible
to be matey, and friendly and
nice to each other.
But for an Indian a white
.man who travels in taxis is a
sahib. So the guide was
puzzled by Val’s remark. And
it was only after about three
minutes or so that he picked
up the drift of her questions:
“I see, I see,” he said. “You
mean they give me big appreci-
ation for my work?”
“Yes.”
“Yes, maybe fifty rupees,
maybe a hundred rupees.”
“Well, we’re not Americans.”
“Not Americans? Then
which country you come
from?”
“My husband is a simple boy
from the bush.”
“A simple boy from the
bush? No, Ido not follow
you.”
Howell was beginning to feel
like a man discovered in an
obscene position. So in a
desperate effort to recover the
situation he took over from
Val:
“She means we’re from Aus-
tralia.”
“Ah, yes, Australians. They
know how to show apprecia-
tion too. Ah, yes, one of your
people in 1951 . . . man with
sheep . . . how do you say it . . .
yes, thank you, a squatter, his
appreciation was two hundred
rupees.”
“God . . .” Howell muttered,
and sank back into the corner
of his seat.
“And now,” the guide began,
“I must explain to you the
Hindu word ‘Maya.’ Hindus
believe the world of senses, the
world we see, world we touch,

The Horses
The big racing scene now
shifts to a warmer climate —
Brisbane. In about seven weeks
the £lO,OOO Stradbroke Stakes
(seven furlongs), the £12,315
Brisbane Cup (two miles) and
the £2500 Moreton Handicap
(11 furlongs) will be contested
by some of the best horses in
Australasia. The Q.T.C. will
distribute £40,000 at the
carnival, which will be decided
over three days: Saturday,
June 15; Monday, June 17; and
Saturday, June 22. The
B.A.T.C. follows-up with an
attractive fixture at Doomben.
A.J.C. officials were happy
over the big increase in
attendance-figures for the four
days of the autumn carnival.
Top-class horses and ideal
weather conditions were con-
tributing factors. Aggregate
attendance at Randwick for the
four days —201,000, an average
of 50,000 per day—was quite
satisfactory compared with
165,000 for the four days last
year.
Sandara, best three-year-old
filly of the year, is one of the
few of the progeny of the
French sire Sandastre to make
good ; but Sandastre has had
limited opportunities. Sandara’s
effortless win in the Adrian
Knox Stakes —after conceding
the runaway pacemaker and
runner-up, Lady Orator, more
than a dozen lengths in the final
five furlongs stamps her a
staying filly with Cups’ possi-
bilities in the coming season.
Her family-lines include Beau
Vite (31 wins and £27,770 in
stakes), Skipton (Melbourne
Cup), and Gaine Carrington
(Caulfield Cup). Her dam,
Aloof, is by Regular Bachelor
from Lady Merna by Perinthus
and traces to Carbine’s son,
Wallace. Sandara’s share of
the Adrian Knox Stakes, £3844!,
raised her stake-earnings to
£10,173. Eighteen starts have
yielded seven wins, four
seconds, and three thirds. The
Melbourne Cup could be her
spring mission.
Sydney Paddock bookmaker
Jack Mandel has been in the
racing game a long time, and
has raced and bred several
smart gallopers. Perhaps Prince
Darius, who humped a welter-
weight 9.9 to victory in the
A.J.C. Fernhill Handicap —
first two year-old mile of the
Sydney season —will prove his
best from the breeding angle.
The coll won with something
in reserve. Raced by relatives of
Mandel and trained at Rand-
wick by Joe Cook, Prince
Darius could prove a Derby
hope in the spring. Four wins
from 11 starts have been
recorded at Randwick. His
“Never mind , dear. You'll be a hit on TV!"
sire, Persian Book (imp.),
already has sired a winner of
the Q.T.C. Derby Book
Link ; but Prince Darius could
prove the best of his progeny.
Persian Book is a son of
Pherozshah, who is a half-
brother of Mahmoud, a winner
of the English Derby.- Lyrical
Lass, dam of Prince Darius,
comes from the family which
produced two winners of the
Melbourne Cup Hall Mark
and Trivalve.

Shock results in weight-for-
age races are becoming
commonplace. One more was
added to the list when Red-
craze went down in the mile-
and-threequarters Queen Eliza-
beth Stakes, highlight of the
final day of the Randwick
autumn carnival. There wasn’t
the .slightest semblance of
fluke about the success of the
brilliant pacemaker Empire
Link, ridden in a masterly
fashion by N. Sellwood. He
did all the heavy work, yet
covered the 14 furlongs in
2.56 9-10, just under two
seconds outside the Randwick
and Australian record, 2.55,
held by Young Crusader.
New Zealand hoop R. J.
Skelton held a brief measure of
popularity on the concluding
day of the Randwick carnival.
He rode a well-judged race to
win the Dangar Highweight on
Franlyle ; but 40 minutes later
he was roasted by punters and
stewards for his display on the
beaten favorite, Decisive, in
the Final Handicap. Despite
her brilliant win in the
Osborne Handicap five days
earlier, Franlyle was at 12-to-l
for the Highweight; Skelton
handled her skilfully. Decisive,
after being handy all the way,
ran* out on the turn, and
finished under the judge’s box.
Stewards were far from im-
pressed with Skelton’s per-
formance —and they told him
in as many words. He has a
good record in New Zealand,
but on Australian perform-
ances he’s no artist of the
pigskin. *

It is seldom a thoroughbred
breeder finds two colts each
realising 5000gns. at the same
sale—especially when they
enter the ring in succession.
This was the experience of
A. O. Ellison, of Baramul Stud
(Kerrabee), at the Randwick
auction. John Inglis found
keen competition for the two
sons'of Star Kingdom (imp.),
and each brought 5000gns.
Adolph Basser secured the first,
and trainer M. McCarten the
second. Basser’s colt, a first
foal from the Manitoba (imp.)
mare Rare Pleasure (a half-
sister to Slick Chick and Deed),
is a striking individual ; and
the Magic Ring colt carries
his blood nicely. Magic Ring,
who’s by Ringmaster (imp.)
from Damaris by Limond
(imp.), won races on city tracks
and has thrown several winners.
One of the best-looking
colts sold at the Randwick
sales and a highly
credentialled youngster at
that—was the son of Nilo
(imp.) and Waterlady, she a
winner of the V.R.C. Oaks
and the A.J.C. Adrian Knox
Stakes. Bidding for him
started at lOOOgns., and at
3400gn5., the call of Rand-
wick trainer T. J. Smith, he
was knocked-down, the highest
sale of the opening day.
Waterlady is by Midstream
(imp.) from Best Wishes by
Agincourt (imp.). She is a
half-sister to Forest Beau, a
winner of the Q.T.C. Derby
and St. Leger. Bred by Lionel
Israel at his Segenhoe Stud
(Scone), the colt was Water-
lady’s first progeny. He did
her credit.

Newcastle Jockey Club puts
on its £2OOO Newmarket fixture
on Monday, May 6, a holiday
in the coal-city. Run at seven
furlongs, the Newmarket has
attracted several top sprinters
from Sydney tracks, and
should be a lively affair.
Win or lose, racegoers at
Moonee Valley last Saturday
had their share of excitement.
Six of the eight events were
won by a neck or less. In one
of the other races, the mile
Airport Welter, Kabarra
passed the post half a length
to the good of Meath, only to
lose the race on protest. The
stewards’ decision was
unpopular with the crowd, who
had supported Kabarra to
favoritism, and a surprise to
the bookmakers who offered
liberal odds against the judge’s
placings being altered. Meath
is a four-year-old gelding out
of Crown Seal by the imported
Pamphilos. A very smart per-
former on the English turf,
Pamphilos has been a most
successful sire of sprinters. He
created a record when his first-
season stock won 14 races and
stakes totalling £9838.
There was a piquant touch to
the finish of the first Royal
Park Handicap at the Valley.
With a hundred yards to go,
Misty Anne was two lengths
clear. Just when the followers
of Ted Courtney’s stable —
they’d backed the Meadow
Mist filly from sixes to threes
—were calculating their win-
nings, rank outsider Silver
Rappit put in a strong run that
landed him a last-stride winner.
It was poor consolation to
Misty Anne’s supporters to
realise that the winner was
trained by Courtney’s son
Brian, one of the youngest
trainers in Victoria. Although
she was friendless in the bet-
ting, Silver Rappit had won a
small country event on Easter
Monday, and is better, appar-
ently, than her connections
realised. Misty Anne was hav-
ing her first start after a spell,
and she will be much fitter next
time up.
Silver Rappit was bought
at the Melbourne yearling-
sales last year for 500gns. She
is related to Counsel and
Lincoln, two Caulfield Cup
winners. Bred by L. F.
Aldridge at Kismet Park Stud
(Sunbury), the filly is by
Empyrean (imp.) from Rain-
bow by Solar Bear (imp.) from
Rouge by Hellespont (imp.),
and traces to Comedy King
(imp.). Rouge is a half-sister
to Lincoln and to Open Mind,
the dam of Counsel.
Prince Abbott, who won
last Saturday’s Annadale
Handicap, was such a hopeless
galloper on Sydney tracks that
he was given to a Melbourne
businessman to be used as a
hack. He proved an outlaw,
and was brought back to racing
under the care of Caulfield
trainer M. R. Macrae. In little
over a year he has won six
events, including the last
Geelong Cup. Prince Abbott
was ridden a heady race by
Doug. Barclay, who later com-
pleted a double on Royal
Djafar. Barclay’s attempt to
make a comeback, mentioned
here some weeks ago, is now
a complete success. He has
ridden eleven winners in seven
weeks.
There was a streak of
coincidence about the two
divisions of the Ardconnell
Handicap for three-year-old
fillies. The respective favorities,
Sleep Tight and Nashira, were
quoted at odds-on, both started
from 12 barrier, and both let
their punters down. More-
over, Peter King rode the
winner of each heat. In Har-
mony and Sleep Tight raced
together from barrier to post
in the first division, and it was
King’s strength. over the last
few yards that gained the day.
Mistomer, who won the second
division, is owned by two
English brothers, Dr. A. and
Mr. M. Learner, who were
impressed by her sire, Atout
Maitre, when he raced in
England during the war-years.
Atout Maitre has been repre-
sented by winners in fourteen
countries.

Quite a few sailors from the
four U.S. Navy ‘destroyers
visiting Melbourne were at
Caulfield the other week. One
of them told The Bulletin
representative that he rated the
course as good as any he had
seen. Asked if people in his
home State—California —were
keen racegoers, he said there
were races every day around
Los Angeles, except on Sun-
days. And on Sundays, a bus
made the 130-mile trip to the
Caliente track in Mexico!

Conqueror of Caduceus a
fortnight earlier in the Harold
Park Free-for-All, N.S.W. hope
in the postponed Lord Mayor’s
Cup, Sky High, in the mean-
time went sore, and was with-
drawn. Some of the sting was
thus .taken from the event, but
a class field nevertheless
paraded. Inter - Dominion
winner Radiant* Venture was
favorite ; Enzedder Caduceus,
backmarker on 36yds., was
second elect.
Given his head from his
12yds. handicap, Radiant
Venture, the big-boned black,
was soon in front, pacing
boldly. Caduceus had begun
well, and was eased through the
field by driver Watts ; then he
was trailing the big South
Australian, menacing. The bell-
lan and Watts, pulling on the
off-side rein, had the smallest
horse in the field alongside the
biggest—then past him, racing
to one of the most impressive
wins seen on the course.
Radiant Venture fought on
doggedly for second ; First
Variety ran on brilliantly for
third. Caduceus survived a
futile protest. Having won the
event last year, also from the
back mark, Caduceus is the
first dual winner of the Lord
Mayor’s Cup.
This Saturday night at
Harold Park the heats of the
£4OOO N.S.W. Pacer’s Derby
are run ; the Final is decided
the following week. Interest in
the event, always high, has
been quickened by the threat
that the N.Z. stablemate of
Caduceus —Dignus —throws to
the locals. Dignus is trained
in New Zealand by J. D. Litten,
a great friend of J. D. Watts,
who has handled Caduceus
both in his training and in
races this Sydney trip. In one
run in Australia to date —a
gymkhana exhibition—Dignus
shaped like a Derby horse. He
is a plain-looking bay, almost
as diminutive as Caduceus;
much less attractive. But he
paces with the precision of his
stablemate. With wins over
distances up to 13 furlongs and
fast mile-rates to-his credit on
Dominion tracks, Dignus will
keep the best of the locals
busy. First Knight, Bangaroo
Lass, Diabolo Don, General
Scott and Pang will present his
toughest opposition.

After two rounds, Hawthorn
and Essendon, which finished
seventh and sixth respectively
last year, are at the top of the
V.F.L. ladder. They are the
only two teams to have won
both their games. Hawthorn,
though its kicking-boots were
on the wrong foot, staged a
magnificent last-quarter burst
to beat Richmond, 9.22-8.9.
Essendon, seemingly revitalised
this year, thrashed Collingwood
in the first round, and always

round game, make-up “the

the last two years, are both still
finding themselves this year;

hard-fought battle, with the
Demons holding-off ’Wood’s
last-quarter challenge, 10.20-
10.12. ’Wood has thus lost its
first two games, and has only
disappointing South, thrashed
by Carlton 10.16-6.16 on Satur-
day, below it on the ladder.
All in all, though, it looks like
being a most interesting year.
“K.R.”: Oldest player in the
V-F.L. this year is Essendon
captain-rover Bill Hutchison.
He’s- 34, and this is his 16th
year in the League; in the
trials and first games he’s
appeared to be as good as
ever, and he says he has
no idea of retiring. Last
year Hutchison led the V.F.L.
team at the Perth carnival.

In what was a disappoint-
ing match -of - the - day, in
Sydney’s Rugby Union,
Gordon proved far superior to
Randwick, and inflicted on the
Greens their first defeat this
season. Veteran skipper Bob
Davidson played real captain’s-
football —and then some —to
play a big part in Gordon’s
16-3 win. University followed
its victory over Gordon last
Saturday by “whitewashing”
weak Drummoyne, 37-0, while
Manly had an easy win over
North, also appearing some-
what enfeebled, 25-5 —though
North did lead 5-3 at half-time.
In better-matched games, St.'
George, now on top of the
table, beat Parramatta 9-6, and
East just shaded Eastwood,
14-13.

The N.S.W. country carnival
resulted in Central West
winning the Caldwell Cup for
the second successive year. In
the final, at Manly on Satur-.
day, it beat Western Zone 27-6 ;
State centre Graham Bailey
scored three brilliant tries,
after long runs in each case,
while State winger-goalkicker
John Stanbrook (who had
scored three tries, earlier in
the week, against Riverina)
scored 12 points (three goals,
two penalties). Runner-up to
Central West was not Western
Zone but Newcastle, the best
of the other teams; Central
West had just got there, 16-15,
when it played Newcastle in
the first game of the carnival.
On Saturday, at North
Sydney, Country I and II play

“Imperial 55”: Accountancy
and Rugby Union go hand in
hand in the firm of Bowes and
Craig. Senior-partner Wylie
Breckenridge, who’s just retired
from the administrative side
of the Union after 30 years,
is remembered for his hard
playing with Drummoyne.
Along with Jock Blackwood,
A. C. Wallace, and others, he
was a member of the Waratah
team that toured Great Britain
in 1927-28. He managed the
South African tour and the last
New Zealand tour, and finished
his career with a flourish, as
chairman of the Australian
Rugby Union. Working in the
same office is Keith Cross, an
international with a reputation
for rising to the occasion in
a crisis ; he’s big and very fast.
Randwick is Cross’s home
territory, but he’s been with
the Wallabies in South Africa
and New Zealand, as well as
representing Australia against
visiting teams. Now another
member of the staff, Les Beattie
—lB-year-old, 6ft., stone —
has been selected as break-
away with Eastern Suburbs, and
will be opposing Cross in line-
outs.
“N.A.8.”: Ron Jarden,
greatest scoring N.Z. Rugby
Union winger on record, has
given up the game. In 131 first-
class matches he notched 915
points— an average of just on
seven points, or better than
two tries, a match. Jarden’s
record included the most points
scored by one player in an All
Blacks match and the most
points run-up on an All
Blacks tour of Australia. His
career was short: he began in
1949.

In a split round on Thurs-
day and Saturday Sydney’s
Rugby League had its ups and
downs —the ups -on Thursday ;
the downs on Saturday. Thurs-
day’s match-of-the-day saw
Wests pack-down against Easts,
and come off conquerors and
top o’ the League ladder, 27-16.
The match was generally rated
the best of the season. In the
other Thursday matches, New-
town got Souths’ measure,
13-7; Manly bested
Parramatta, 17-10.
St. George and Norths
inhabited the Cricket Ground
on Saturday afternoon, and the
crowd slow-handclapped their
efforts. Not a try was scored
in the first half, and only a few
bright St George efforts after
lemons saved the match from
complete farce. St. George got
the verdict, 17-5. The other
Saturday match, between
Canterbury and Balmain, was
the first televised League game
—and a poor advertisement for
the sport. Three players were
sent off—two Berries, one
Tiger; no tries were scored.
Barnes’s boot was safer than
Dunn’s: Balmain, 12-10.

Women’s Letters
SYDNEY
The Sydney “season” (1957) has been
ushered in with the usual kaleidoscopic
Easter festivities but played out this year
in an atmosphere of shining blue summer
days, glowing turquoise evenings, and
moonlit nights.
* ft ' ft
A million and more people went to the
Royal Easter Show, fewer than in ’56,
more than in ’55. Was it better-than-ever
or not? No matter —it is always the
same show that is different to every
person. One will remember the polo,
another the house of oranges and lemons
in the Moreton Downs agricultural-
display, another the border-collie pups
(20gns. each and all sold), many the
“Kelly Boys” (champion riders John Kelly
and John Sutton) dressed as clowns and
entertaining the crippled children, Jess
the familiar W. C. Penfold’s horse,
dressed to kill and winning a prize, the
fish with feet and the accusing eyes, the
newborn calves and other young things
that had opened their eyes on the Show
and probably thought they had been born
into the wonderful land of O % where
children had dinners of ice-blocks and
fairy-floss and adults had nothing to do
but gaze and admire.
Meanwhile the Randwick race-meeting
was establishing, against all competition
from the sun, that high fur-hats are the
fashion, and that the most elegant suits
are those such as Mrs. Bill Murrell and
Mrs. Noel Vincent v/ore, loosely-fitted,
wide-lapelled, and open-necked. And
though it is almost impossible to buy a
chiffon blouse in Sydney at the moment,
by the end of the season there will be “no
wardrobe complete without one.”
“Ned Kelly” hats were featured, the
name referring not only to the shape but
also to the price, and the mink-muff, a
charming accessory, made its appearance
on two or three occasions.
ft ft ft
The usual social events went along
with a merry spin, a few extras thrown
in and one or two missing. The Peter
Pan Ball, the Town and Country Ball,
the Union Club’s party with its gardenia-
garlanded staircase (for once not held on
Ladies’ Day, for this had been combined
with the Anzac Day meeting), St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital Ball, the Matrons’ Ball
at the Royal Sydney Golf Club with 36
hostesses strictly in alphabetical order,
the cocktail-parties for people drawn
together by their common interest in
Shorthorns, Polled Herefords, Aberdeen-
Angus, etc., the Easter weddings,
ft ft ft
Among the most interesting of these
was the marriage of Leslie Baillieu, second
daughter of the Tim Baillieus of Tongy,
Cassilis, to Doug Pickering, son of the
Alan Pickerings of Roseville. Country
districts were well represented in the
wedding-party as well as among the
guests. Mrs. Geoff Abram (Quirindi) was
matron-of-honor, with bridesmaids
Rosanne Davenport and Jeanette Picker-
ing. It was an all-white wedding except
for the pale-green in the attendants’ tiny
curvette hats and their bouquets of lily-
of-the-valley and little green orchids.
The young couple are to live at Armidale.
ft ft ft
Lady Slim, who had earlier attended the
wedding of Flight-Lieutenant and Mrs.
John McNeil at Scots Church, Mosman,
was present at the opening night of
“Hamlet” at the Elizabethan Theatre on
Saturday. It was a dress-up night and a
full-house, though unfortunately not full
till well after the curtain h2d gone up.
Francisco’s “You come most carefully
upon your hour” could have been taken
as irony had the rustlings and jostlings
allowed it to be heard. Mr. John Mills,
Dr. and Mrs. Coombs, and Mr. and Mrs.
J. R. Kirby welcomed her Excellency
with Education Minister R. J. Heffron
arid Mrs. Heffron.
The dressing of “Hamlet” by Alister
Roberts is obviously as costly as the purse
can buy, but it is very definitely “ex-
pressed in fancy.” One glance at the
headdresses of the cast, men as well as
women, convinces us that our turbans
and Eiffel-tower hats are remarkably
restrained.
Gabrielle Sim, second daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. J. A. Sim of Roseville, has
recently announced her engagement to
John Claremont, son of the late Dr. and
Mrs. Claremont of Lindfield. Both
Gabrielle and John are tennis enthusiasts
who play with the Killara Club. They
plan to marry at the end of the year.

Anzac Day followed closely on the
Easter holidays, and it too shared the
golden weather. A happy occasion this
year was the opening of Anzac House,
a beautiful building in College-street, first
mooted 13 years ago, now a reality.
ft ft ft
A sad little touch was added to the
Anzac commemoration this year when the
first meeting of the Anzac Fellowship of
Women was held without its founder and
president, Dr. Mary Booth, 0.8. E., who
died last year at the age of 91. It was this
Fellowship which first suggested the rose-
mary for remembrance as a symbol of
Anzac Day, and although its membership
is dwindling, its acting-president, Mrs.
Ellen Gooch, says that it will continue
to meet in memory of soldiers for whom
they had worked in three wars.

“Nat” Madison is a name Sydney
theatregoers will remember. The son
of Maurice Moscovitch, he came here in
the twenties for a six-months’ season
and stayed for five years. Now as Noel
Madison he is a leading producer of
TV-films in America, but is to return to
Sydney to play an important part in “The
Diary of Anne Frank,” which comes to
the Theatre Royal at the end of May.
This play is adapted from the factual
diary of a young Dutch girl who hid away
with her family from the Nazis during the
war. The diary itself has- made such an
impact on the civilised world that even
in West Germany, among the people who
were responsible for the horrors that
beset the Frank family, it has become
standard reading in all secondary schools.

Mrs. Gwen Morton Spencer, presiding
at the Society of Women Writers’ monthly
luncheon on Wednesday, read a request
from her friend Miss Blanche D’Alpuget
for the name of “any Australian story tnat
presents this land as an agreeable place
with agreeable people,” for she wishes to
send it to friends in England. Members
present racked their brains, but sugges-
tions were sparse. Our writers certainly
do seem to concentrate on the sad and the
sordid.
The speaker at the luncheon was Mr.
Eric Baume, his subject “Experiences in
Television.” His advice t» people who
might be called upon to appear on tele-
vision was “Be natural and be sincere,
for the TV camera is like a lie-detector on
which affectations and insincerities show
up to an embarrassing degree.” Welcom-
ing Mr. Baume to the luncheon with Mrs.
Morton Spencer were Miss Kitty Archer
Burton, Mrs. Jan Sopoushek and Miss
Nora Kelly, who proposed the vote, of
thanks in a graceful speech.

Dr. Nicolai Malko, the Symphony
Orchestra’s very engaging new Musical
Director, hopes to have contests for Aus-
tralian compositions and afterwards to
perform the best of them. He has given
first-performances of a great deal of con-
temporary music, and thinks that the
trend in composition is back to natural
music. “It seems that some composers
are no longer afraid to admit melody,”


he says. “I remember Richard Strauss
saying to me, about one of his works, T
am afraid I must confess iLis melodious.’
However, Prokofieff remarked to me,
when 1 commented on the lyrical quality
of a new trio of Hindemith: ‘All of us
sinners go back to lyricism ’ ”

A hint for Australians who wish to
beautify the streets of their towns comes
in a letter from Mrs. Arthur Davis, who
is at present travelling in Europe ; she
says: “In Rapallo, on the Italian Riviera,
we saw oranges used as street trees and
they looked lovely, about 15ft. high,
trimmed to a straight trunk with a
rounded head and filled with fruit. We
asked how this was possible in a town
which appeared to have its normal quota
of small boys. The answer is that they are
Seville oranges! In Nice they are grown
in the same way and look especially
lovely at night, when each tree is lighted
from below so that the oranges are all
highlighted, as it were.” •

procession to an appeal for funds for the
Far West Scheme. Sixty floats will leave

MELBOURNE
So that members of Parliament and
their wives could bid farewell to the
Governor and Lady Brooks before they
left for England, a reception was held
in Queen's Hall, Parliament House, the
Premier and Mrs. Henry Bolte being
host and hostess. In an informal atmos-
phere their Excellencies moved from one
group to another, chatting animatedly.
Lady Brooks wore a slim, Princess-line
frock of anthracite-grey wool-faille with
a small guardsman-hat in matching grey
melusine. She carried a small posy of
violets presented to her by Mrs. Bolte.
Mrs. Bolte’s jade-green silk-faille frock,
featured a draped-apron effect across the
front of the skirt. A small white petal-
cap was a charming contrast.
Among the guests were the Lord Mayor
and Lady Mayoress (Cr. Sir* Frank and

On their way to Port Melbourne to
board the Iberia, the Governor and Lady
Brooks stopped and paused at the Town
Hall for a brief civic farewell at which
the band of Southern Command played
the National Anthem.
Among those on the dais were the
Lady Mayoress (Lady Selleck), wearing a
slim-fitting black suit with a high hat in
two shades of taupe and trimmed with
a matching bow; Mrs. F. Thomas, Mrs.
Leo Curtis, Mrs. A. D. Whalley, Mrs.
A. G. Rylah (wife of the Chief Secretary)
and Mrs. F. Rogan (wife of the Town
Clerk).
Noted for her work for various
charities, and one of Melbourne’s best-
known hostesses, Mrs. James Bowen Pain
has just become Organiser of Auxiliaries
for the Queen Victoria Hospital, of which
Dame Mabel Brookes is president. The
Q.V. is the largest women’s hospital in
the world which is also entirely staffed
by women. Mrs. Bowen Pain is the wife
of a well-known businessman; their son
Peter is doing Law at the University.
- Every Anzac Day at 11 a.m. Women
of the Royal Australian Army Nursing
Corps gather at the Edith Cavell
memorial in St. Kilda-road for a
service in which the nurses of
both wars are h o'n o r e d . This
year, after more than 30 wreaths had
been laid at the foot of the memorial,
Major-General Sir Samuel Burston gave
the address. Several of those who
attended wore the Royal Red Cross,
among them Miss Gertrude Davis, who
‘was the only Australian to win the K.I.H.
medal (Kaiser I Hind Medal) ; this was
given to her as the principal m'atron in
India, where she spent more than three
years after service in Lemnos and Egypt.
On her return Miss Davis was Matron of
Hamilton Russell House. Miss Ida
O’Dwyer, Matron of the Caulfield
Military Hospital, won two Royal Red
Cross Medals for service in Egypt,
France and England. She was one of the
original 25 nurses who formed the Aus-
tralian Army Nursing Service in 1902.
On behalf of the Lady Mayoress (Lady
Selleck) a wreath was laid by Cr. F. W.
Thomas. Mrs. R. G. Casey was also
among those who placed wreaths, and
Mrs. R. W. Chambers (Returned Nurses
Club), Mrs. W. R. Napier (Eighth Div.
nurses) and Sister V. Bullwinkel also
brought lovely floral tributes.
Later in the day more than 200 women,
some in the grey uniform of the Nursing
Corps, the blue uniforms of the V.A.D.
and W.A.A.A.F. and the khaki of the
Army, as well as those in civilian dress,
once again briskly stepped out in the
Anzac Day March. They' were led, for the
10th successive year, by Col. A. L. Sage,
former Matron -in - Chief of the
R.A.A.N.C. Behind her marched 100
nurses, including five lieut.-colonels:
Matron Hanrahan (Repat. Hosp., Heidel-
berg) ; Matron M. J. Hanna (Lady Supt.
of the Alfred Hospital); LieuL-Col. G.
Brundley (Principal Matron, Southern
Command); Mrs. F. Shippen, and Mrs.
J. Mackellar, who came from Sydney
to march with her friends. One nurse,
Miss Florence Vines, rode in one of the
cars in the procession—she served in the
Balkans in the 1914-18 World War. Her
niece, Miss D. Vines, was marching, for
she had served in the Middle East, New
Guinea and the Northern Territory in the
last war.
On May 6, at 9 a.m., the Your Oppor-
tunity Committee will hold its third annual
parade and clothing sale in the Lower
Town Hall. Headed by Mrs. Leo Curtis,
the committee last year raised £l7OO for
the Thornbury Opportunity Club and
Kindergarten for boys and girls. This
year’s sale will be of new and used cloth-
ing for all members of the family.

Some information on the
magazine “The Bookfellow
published in 1899 ?
(From Walter Stone.) This was a
“Monthly Magazinelet for Book-
buyers and Book-readers,” pub-
lished from The Bulletin office.
Five numbers appeared between
January 7, 1899, and May 31, 1899,
the first priced at a penny and the
“ Whisky! Vodka! Coca-Cola! Beer! Wont be sorry when
they go back!”
last “Sold for Love and Three-
pence.” It was edited and in a
large measure written by A. G.
Stephens, who seems to have used
some of the contributions which
were intended for the Red Page.
Whilst he may, and possibly was,
responsible for the unsigned con-
tents, many of the magazine’s con-
tributors were well-known to
Bulletin readers. Among them
were Victor Daley, C. J. Brennan,
Rod Quinn, Albert Dorrington and
Frank Morton. It may have been
merely a literary experiment by
Stephens; and again Stephens’s
interest in it may have been of a
proprietary nature, because when he
left The Bulletin some years later
he re-established “The Bookfellow.”
In fact, he strove over the years to
establish it on a permanent basis,
and there are a number of series of
the magazine—none of them so
exotic or experimental as the 1899
issue, with its varying formats and
prices.

Some information on the deriva-
tion of the Australian cattle-dag ?
(Reference for the following has
been The Australian Encyclopcedia.
A more complete answer will no
doubt be given in the next few weeks
fey readers in disagreement with it.)
The Australian cattle-breeder
found himself confronted with a
problem similar to that which had
faced the sheep-breeder: he wanted
a dog capable of carrying out a
type of work that was unique to
the handling of cattle under Aus-
tralian conditions.
The sheep-breeder had found it
necessary to evolve a special breed
of dog by crossings; the cattle-
breeder, tortuously, took the same
course.
The first colonists had brought
with them a dog known as the
, , , . u . t T-u- .u ij
black bob-ta.l. This was the old
English cur-dog, a big, brown,
rough-coated, square-bodied animal,
with a wedge-shaped, flat head and
drop-ears. Since they were faith-
ful and sensible, the black bob-
tails, in the early days, when the
farms were small and the cattle
quiet, served their turn; but when
the country was opened-up and
the stock had to travel long dis-
tances, they proved unsuitable.
Attempting to overcome the
defects of this breed, a drover
named Timmins conceived the notion
of crossing the black bob-tail with
the dingo—thus the red bob-tail.
Though a silent and hardy worker,
this dog was a very severe biter,
always prone to killing calves when
working out of the drover’s sight.
Next, a cross of the rough-haired
collie and the dingo was tried; but
this type had the habit of running
to the head and barking, instead of
working from the' back and sides.
A number of other crosses were
tried, involving various breeds—
bulldog, kangaroo-dog, bull-terrier,
rough-haired collie but they
proved, in the main, uncontrollable.
On the big cattle-runs which were
taking shape the need for a silent,
tractable, clean-biting dog was
becoming more and more essential.
Consequently, in 1840 a squatter
named Hall, at Muswellbrook
(N.S.W.), imported a pair of blue-
grey “merles” —marbled or mottled
smooth-haired Scotch dogs, said to
be good at working cattle.
This breed had its origin in the
blend of the old English mastiff
(they were protectors against
wolves), the greyhound and the
Scotch collie. Though merles were
a great improvement on previous
breeds, they still had the old collie
habit of barking and running to the
head. Hall therefore crossed them
with the dingo,
The result proved a great success:
the progeny had the dingo habit of
creeping up behind and biting. First
known as “Hall’s heelers,” they
subsequently became “blue-heelers”;
the pups came red-mottled or bluc-
mottled, according to the strain
mL* ltl ha ,L
nated. Most of them were ot the
dingo type _ prick . e a r ed, with the
brown eye of the dingo—though
occasionally there occurred the
“china” or white eye so prevalent
in the merle.
A man named Alexander Davis is
credited, about 20 years later, with
taking fie dogs to Sydney, where,
at the Homebush saleyards, having
attracted much attention, they were
taken up by various drovers and
butchers.
As they were the result of a
direct cross, a distinct type was not
fixed. The next move, therefore,
was to infuse the blood of the
Dalmatian or spotted carriage-dog,
and subsequently that of the kelpie.
The result, in the hands of skilful
breeders, was a compact, active dog,
identical with pure dingo in type
and build, with peculiar markings
found in no other dog in the world.

BRITISH DEFENCE CHANGES
A SAMPLING of the
comment evoked by the
sweeping changes announced
by the British White Paper on
defence concentration on
atomic and nuclear weapons,
guided-missiles and rockets;
reduction of the armed forces
from 700,000 to 375,000 by
1952 ; a 13,000-cut in Britain’s
contribution to Nato forces
in Germany; withdrawal of
1500 men from the U.N. force
in Korea ; and similar reduc-
tions elsewhere:
London “News Chronicle” :
“The new plans involve some-
thing even bigger than the
biggest change in military
policy ever made in normal
times. They recognise a new
concept of war and how to
meet its threat
“Mr. San d y s [Defence
Minister] tells us bluntly that
there is no protection for the
nation against nuclear attack.
We must therefore prevent
war rather than prepare for it;
and to prevent war —runs the
argument—we must put our
faith in the deterrent. Peace
must be maintained by making
war too terrible to contem-
plate.
“For the ordinary public
everywhere there is now one
overriding question. Human
ingenuity has discovered how
to wipe out humanity. Civilisa-
tion has learned how to destroy
itself. When and how can it
reach the next stage of true
progress—a rational approach
to disarmament through which
it can save itself?”
* * *
“Manchester . Guardian ” :
“The new Five-Year Plan is
also the firmest pledge ever
given that Britain will stay in
the Atlantic Alliance, and rely
upon it. The Minister of
Defence, Mr. Sandys, says in
his White Paper:
“ ‘The growth in the power
of weapons of mass-destruc-
tion has emphasised the fact
that no country can any longer
protect itself in isolation. The
defence of Britain is possible
only as part of the collective
defence of the Free World.
This conception of collective
defence is the basis of the
North Atlantic, South-east
Asia, and Baghdad alliances.’ ”
* * *
London “Daily Mail” : “Mr.
Sandys has had 80 days in
which to prepare his White
Paper. It could be called
Round the Bomb in Eighty
Days, for it is the development
of the thermonuclear weapon
which has ..transformed war
and the world.
“Fit to Fight”
“For the first time in peace
Britain will have Forces fit to
fight a next war (if it should
New York “Herald Tribune ”
“THERE, NOW WERE BACK ON MOSCOW TIME ”
ever come) rather than the
last one. The immediate effect
will be to lift a burden from
the country’s economy. The
saving of £117,000,000 in the
first year is more than expected.
It should encourage the
Government to make at least
some small concessions to the
taxpayer.”
* * *
London “Financial Times" :
“What is wrong with the exist-
ing defence-structure —now to
be replaced—is not merely that
it is too burdensome, true
though that is, but also that
it is too inefficient. The
attempt to carry a huge
defence commitment with little
regard to changing needs was
both economically damaging
and provided too little value in
terms of national security, or
the ability to conduct a cam-
paign. The Suez episode was a
demonstration of that.”
Navy and Air Force
London “Sunday Times":
“Mr. Sandys’s ‘revolution’ in
defence ought to be matched
by two other revolutions, in
industrial relations and in
public finance. Like his, they
need to be based upon a ruth-
less rejection of an outworn
past, a concentration upon
main objectives, and a hopeful
and progressive plan for the
future. There is a vast amount
of useless and dangerous
lumber cluttering up the wage-
structure and the conduct of
industrial relations on the one
hand, and the fiscal system on
the other: policies and prac-
tices born of bygone conditions
like mass-unemployment or
war-time finance. In our tax-
system, and in our labor-
relations, as in our defences,
we are dangerously prone to
“go on fighting the last war.’ ”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph ”
editorial comment: “Some
economies and many reforms
are implied rather than stated.
For example, the drastic reduc-
tion in the armed forces’ claim
on manpower from 700,000
now to 375,000 by the end of
1962 implies not only great
initial savings in money and
resources, but also important
and painful changes in the
three Services.
“Shall we really need three
separate Ministerial and
administrative tails after 1960?
Will it not prove possible to
associate sailors, soldiers, and
airmen much more closely in
the reduced garrisons and
mobile reserves that are pro-
posed for the future? And will
not co-operation with allies
make it possible to reduce the
heavy demands that are being
made on our research workers
and technicians?”
The same: “The stop on
fighter-aircraft beyond the
supersonic PI and on ail plans
for a supersonic bomber is a
bold decision. It means,
regrettably, an end of the
R.A.F. as we have known it,
but even the noblest tradition
must yield to necessity. The
Navy will have to balance
against its chagrin about the
cruiser-programme and the big
ships the White Paper’s firm
support of the aircraft-carrier.”
* * *
Nowell Hall in London
“Daily Telegraph": “The pass-
ing of the battleship, at any
rate so far as the Royal Navy
is concerned, brings to an end
a phase of sea-power. The
modern ship, the aircraft-
carrier, has now replaced the
battleship as the spearhead of
attack.
“Thus there are now only
22 reasonably modern battle-
ships still afloat. Russia and
Argentina have between them
five old battleships of early
First World War vintage. All
are descendants of the Dread-
nought, the first 17,000-ton
battleship, which was built at
Portsmouth in 1905 and revolu-
tionised warship design and
naval tactics.
“It is appropriate, if sadly
significant, that the next Dread-
nought is to be Britain’s first
atomic submarine.”

Charles S. Thomas, formerly
U.S. Secretary of the Navy, in
London “Sunday Times":
“Barely 18 months have passed

one aircraft-carrier, either
built, building or authorised.
“Nuclear power is now
conventional for all new sub-
marines, and soon will be for
cruisers and carriers. Sooner
than we might think, it will
be applied to smaller combat-
ships such as destroyers.”
The same: “In attack,
imagine the nuclear-powered
submarine, with its great speed,
as a launching-platform for a
missile of 1200 to 1500 miles
range. There is virtually no
place in the world beyond its
reach. Thus the marriage of
the missile and the nuclear-
propelled submarine gives the
free world an important new
deterrent for use in preserving
world peace.”

"Manchester Guardian”:
“Canada has established a
series of country-wide warning-
posts in the far north to detect
and report the approach of
strange aircraft coming from
the polar region. But it is clear
that the Royal Canadian Navy
and Air Force now are deeply
troubled by the possibility of
the large ocean-going sub-
marine-fleet on which the
Russian Navy has concentrated
being used to launch atomic
missiles from hundreds of miles
out in the Atlantic or Pacific.”
Rockets and Missiles
London “Economist”:
“Missiles take perhaps a year or
so less to develop than aircraft,
but their gestation must still
be measured over several years.
To keep a sense of perspective,
some distinction must be drawn
between the weapons that are
available now, and those that
will not be in service for several
years. The short-range atomic
missile is a tactical weapon of
the present. The American
Corporal rocket used by British
and American troops is not an
elegant design, but it is as
effective a means of delivering
a small atomic warhead 50 to
100 miles as any known today.
“The weapons for which the
world is waiting with apprehen-
sion are the ballistic rockets
that can fly at least 1000 miles,
and preferably 1500 miles. The
distance is not arbitrarily
chosen ; it represents the ranges
over which missiles launched
from the East or West sides of
the Iron Curtain could reach
the more important enemy
targets. In America, the true
ballistic missile, the most
advanced of which is Thor, is
only now starting firing trials
as a complete unit. If these
trials go well, Thor might be
in service, and even being
delivered to this country
[Britain], within the next two
or three years. If they go
badly, its introduction could
be much later. A weapon in
the same class as Thor is being
developed in Britain, but its
late start puts it years behind.”
The same: “Meanwhile, the
Russians have been firing test-
missiles with ranges of 1000
miles at a rate that is reported
to have reached as much as five
a month last year. These need
not have been more than test-
vehicles but they suggest that
the Soviet Union must be
approaching the point where a
1000-mile-range weapon could
go into production.
“Beyond these intermediate
missiles are the ultimate
monsters which will further
change the timing of deterrent
strategy, by carrying thermo-
nuclear warheads the 5000
miles that separate the main-
lands of the United States and
Russia. The first American
weapon, Atlas, is due to start
firing trials this year, but that
does not mean that it is any-
thing like as far developed as
Thor, and several years of
intensive work are likely to be
needed before it is. There is
nothing to suggest that the
Russians are any further ahead
here than the Americans,
which leaves them at a disad-
vantage.”
U.S. View
“New York Times”:
“Britain, impelled by simmer-
ing economic crisis, and
encouraged by its own atomic
progress and by promises
of American aid, is attempting
to solve the problem by cutting
down on conventional arma-
ments, including the armed
forces, in favor of a forced
development of the machinery
of atomic warfare to supple-

Don Whitehead and Tom
Lambert in New York “Herald

armed forces, it is known,
have been under heavy
pressure from the White
House to adapt their forces,
organisation and policies more
closely to their nuclear
capabilities. However, it has
become evident that Pentagon
chiefs are not willing, for
various reasons, to move as
fast as the British are mov-
ing.
“But the development of
new weapons in itself is forc-
ing change—and this pressure
is mounting with such dis-
closures as the fact that the

will be ready for operation as
the result of recent spectacular

editorial comment: “The hard
facts of Britain’s strained
economy undoubtedly required
changes in defence-spending.
But the White Paper rests
Britain’s security on a nhmber
of unproved assumptions. One,
which is now widely accepted,
is that the capability for nuclear
retaliation on a devastating
scale is a deterrent to a major
war. Another,- which is cer-
tainly debatable, is that missiles
will be developed on a scale
and at a speed which makes
further progress in manned
aircraft unnecessary. A third
is that a mobile reserve in the
British Isles, with local defence-
forces, can meet the defence-
requirements of Britain abroad
and, to a large extent, Britain’s
commitments to such alliances
as the Baghdad Pact, Seato and
Anzus. The maintenance of
troops in West Germany,
under Nato, will be governed
by negotiations with other
members.
“These assumptions, in one
form or another, have been
extensively debated in the
United States. They have
their supporters here, because
they seem to be in line with
both advanced military think-
ing and, economy. But they do
raise disturbing doubts.

European Reactions
London “Economist”:
“Nato has already suffered
from earlier failures to honor
commitments Germany’s
slowness in rearming, the mass-
migration of the French Army
to Algeria. But these had the
look of temporary failures to
reach an accepted target. The
British decisions call in ques-
tion the target itself. When, for
reasons of economy and
domestic politics, the Govern-
ment aims at cutting the army
to 160,000 men and abolishing
conscription by 1960, the
example is enticing. Several
nations are divided over con-
scription or have accepted it
reluctantly, especially Germany
and the Scandinavian
countries. Many other
countries can insist on the over-
riding need for economy—
above all, France, where the
foreign-trade crisis is already
encouraging thoughts of big
defence-cuts when the Algerian
war is over.”
* * *
“Manchester Guardian” :
“The chief reason for dis-
quiet abroad is, of course, not
the changes themselves, but
their probable effect upon
others. No doubt the Ameri-
cans have already discounted
the effect of announcing cuts
—however mild at first —in the
British defence Budget, while
the United States Defence
Department is fighting off
hatchetmen in Congress and
even in the Treasury.
“The real trouble is likely
to come from our [Britain’s]
Continental partners. Here is
Mr. Sandys announcing
perhaps too confidently—the
end of conscription ; and here
is the French Government
■haying to keep half-a-million
men in North Africa, most of
them conscripts, to the cost
of its obligations to Nato.
“Here, too, is the West
German Government calling-
up its first conscripts, the
number of which it has already
reduced and will now be
pressed to reduce again. At
the same time the Americans’
decision to let us use their
missiles sets up a natural feel-
ing that others have been left
out.

is a sign of the times. Now
that Britain is relying more

The Australian Prime

the expanding role of U.N. in
international relations, notes
that “the fate of this

country [Britain] is now
inextricably bound up with
the United Nations, whose
debates and resolutions tend
to-day to influence British
foreign policy quite as much as,
if not more than, deliberations
at Westminster.
“It was, for example, a
United Nations resolution that
set in motion the new round of
negotiations on Cyprus. When,
therefore, Mr. Menzies, the
Australian Prime Minister, feels
compelled to condemn the
recent United Nations failures
as having betrayed peace and
international justice we cannot
simply nod our heads in agree-
ment and pass on. Or at least
we can—but only at our peril.
“For if Britain does not
receive justice from the United
Nations and cannot, or is not
willing to, win justice by its
own exertions, then our
interests will go—and indeed
already are going—by default.
“The United States, which
advocates reliance on the
United Nations, runs no such
risks. As Mr. Menzies pointed
out, Washington would never
wait for the United Nations
before defending the Panama
Canal. And, of course, the
Soviet Union proved herself in
Hungary la be equally immune.
“It is Britain, therefore, not
the United States or Russia,
which is likely to suffer most
from what Lord Hailsham has
described as the United
Nations’ ‘blemis.hes.’ ”
To which London “Time and
Tide,” in further Middle East
comments, adds:
“That wise and admirable
man, Mr. Menzies, has been
uttering remarks on the whole
matter that breathe sanity and
courage and are therefore
anathema to the timid and
appeasement-minded who still
believe that, if anything is done
to upset Colonel Nasser, a
third World War will immedi-
ately begin.
“Mr. Menzies has been
pondering his experiences of
last summer and they have led
him to this exemplary con-
clusion :
“ ‘The United Nations made
Israel a victim of a double
standard on belligerent rights.
Egypt sought to justify her
denial of passage through the
Canal to Israel ships on the
ground that she was at war
and had belligerent rights and
thus she had been in contempt
of the United Nations for six
years. Israel, having accepted
the proposition that she was
at war with Egypt, attacked,
but was ordered out of the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai
Peninsula; and Egypt still
refuses to allow her ships safe
passage. I cannot believe this
kind of thing is a triumph of
international justice.’
“It is, of course, as Mr.
Menzies implied, the reverse.
The disaster is now miserably
working itself out. The peace
that President Eisenhower, Mr.
Dulles and Mr. Hammarskjoeld
strove so zealously to impose
last November is no peace at
all: the Egyptians say it is not
and the Israelis (now putting
up a barbed-wire fence along
the Gaza Strip frontier) know
it is not. The present tran-
quillity is not the end ; what-
ever happens next is almost
bound to be unpleasant.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Road Finance
Certain pressure-groups in
Victoria are again reviving
State jealousies in an attempt
to discredit the Federal
Government’s present method
of distributing road-aid funds
to the States.
The argument stems from
the chronic shortage of money
for road-building and -main-
tenance in Australia and goes
something like this:
Why should Victoria, with a
large population and a small, well-
developed area, play fairy-god-
moiher to other States (with large,
underdeveloped areas) through a
roads-aid distribution system which
is based three-fifths on population
and two-fifths on area? In return
for their contribution of 31 per
cent, of the petrol-tax paid to
Federal revenue, the people of
Victoria therefore get only 17 per
cent., while other States receive far
more than they have paid. Clearly,
this is not equitable and the basis of
distribution should be reviewed.
One suggestion for a new
system is based on the fact
that the monetary value of
primary products per acre of
land is higher in Victoria than
in any other State, and that
the allocation of available
funds should be made
accordingly.
This argument is quite
illogical because it attempts to
establish another system using
as a starting-point the same
apparent stumbling-blocks to
the present method, namely,
the States themselves. Why
should the States, a s
geographical and demographi-
cal areas, be used as starting-
points at all? And, since they
are, why should it not be just
as validly (and, from a political
point of view, cogently) argued
that the citizens of the city of
Melbourne, using more petrol
per square mile, should not
financially support the con-
struction of roads in the Shire
of Bullamakanka? Reducing
the proposal to an absurdity, it
could be argue*! that there
should be no road through an
uninhabited area because no
people live there.
It is unfortunate that State
interests and narrow State
points-of-view continue t o
advance similarly specious
argument. In this country of
tremendous distances and
sparse population—or for that
matter in any country the
available money and resources
must be used to advance the
common weal. Otherwise, why
not revert to the pre-1901
colonial set-up? Karrimba

Sydney’s G.P.O. Clock
Sydney’s Town Planning
Association has decided to
have yet another go at per-
suading the Goverrunent to
restore the G.P.O. clock and
tower, demolished during the
war. If it succeeds, cost will
be 300 per cent, more than the
£lO,OOO it cost to demolish
the structure. '
For 50 years I was closely
associated with the clock and
tower, and worked on the
structure at intervals during
that period.
Rebuilding will cause some
headaches. The masonry,

years ago, was strewn over a

staff and the copper shaft of
the lightning-conductor.
One of the over-2ft.-
diameter plateglass bullseyes,
with its solid brass frame,

The magnificently worked
copper cupola roof of the
tower was chopped-up at the
G.P.O. workshops when metal
was scarce during the war, and
I don’t know where the spiral
staircase got to.
Verily, the reinstatement of
the G.P.O. tower and clock,
which should not have been
demolished, appears to have

Comics
Any teacher of English to a
post-primary class who is
unable to interpret colloquially
the ballad of “Robin Hood
and Allan-a-dale” (B. 3/4/’57)
without recourse to a “comics”-
version of the same yarn is
not worth his pay. And to
equate the 14th-century ballad
with, a 20th-century “comic” is
like putting the Elizabethan
madrigal on a par with rock-
’n’-roll.
Further, if “L.H.” awaits an
“intellectual discussion” on the
comic, let him resort to his
nearest municipal library and
read what a few notable social
psychologists have to say about
the possible effect on the mind
of the American child of con-
tinued absorption from an
early age of unlimited numbers
of these documents.
Cold - bloodedly scientific,
these reports are sufficiently
spine-chilling for any teacher —
or parent—to encourage his
children to read the sporting-
pages of the dailies in

Children’s Books
Why doesn’t some enterpris-
ing publisher of children’s
books bring out a new edition
of At the End of the Moonyath,
by Donald Macdonald?
Even to know of the author
dates one nowadays, but his
reputation was deservedly
high for many years among
readers of “The Argus” and
“The Australasian.” He
proved a fine war-correspon-
dent during the Boer War, did
sports - comments, gossip -
columns, light verse and the
excellent “Notes for Boys” and
“Nature Notes and Queries”
in the old “Argus.”
His books include How We
Kept the Flag Flying, At the
Warrigal’s Well and The Bush
Boy’s Book. They are rather
outmoded nowadays, but
children still devour my
tattered copy of At the End of
the Moonpath.
Its blend of fantasy, humor
and sound nature-lore, and the
graceful little poems inter-
spersed between chapters,
appeal to a wide range of age-
groups. With a little editing,
and up-to-date format and
illustrations, it should prove
a real winner.—Miss M.

America on the Move
Mobility is nothing new in
the U.S.A. (B. 3/4/’57). In the
19th century, so long as there
were large tracts of virgin lands
in the west, settlers in regions
from which the frontier had
receded would abandon their
holdings and years of hard
work, pack their possessions in
a covered wagon, and set out
west again. Some, in a life-
time, pioneered several suc-
cessive farms in this manner.
Parts of the New England
States were virtually denuded
of able-bodied men and women
in the later 19th century. Most
of the farms and village-
businesses in such places were
occupied either by old folk or
those not energetic enough to
seek their fortunes elsewhere.
Many abandoned farms were
taken over by immigrants from
southern and eastern Europe,
or by French Canadians who
then began to enter those parts
of U.S.A. in strength. Thus
the pattern of the population
substantially changed.
The backvelt Boers of South
Africa were affected by the
same kind of wanderlust,
though in their case it was
desire to continue living a
patriarchal pastoral life free
from close pressure from the

Homes For the Aged
“E.V.A.’s” suggestion that
retired people with some small
capital should form self-help
communities (B. 13/3/’57) has
long been considered (and
implemented to some extent) by
Father Tucker, head of the
Church of England Brother-
hood of Saint Laurence in
Melbourne.
The B.S.L. has tackled many
social problems since its
foundation over 25 years ago,
but one of its main concerns
is for a better deal for the
aged. At the B.S.L. settlement
at Carrum Downs, near
Frankston (Vic.), there are a
number of cottages for retired
folk where they can live use-
ful, independent lives until they
are too old or ill to care for
themselves, when they move
into small self-contained flats
with a communal dining-room,
or into the modern hospital.
They are all encouraged to
take part in the life of the
settlement they staff the
library and general store, grow
all their own vegetables, work
in the lovely gardens which
surround the cottages and com-
munal buildings, and grow
plants for sale in their own
nursery. Most of the furniture
and furnishings for their new
community - centre which
includes a chapel, entertain-
ment hall, canteen and library
—were made by the men and
women * of this self-contained
community.
Originally, all the cottages
were occupied by pensioners,
mainly from the industrial
suburbs, but Father Tucker
realised that many retired
people with a little capital could
live far more useful and
satisfying lives in such a com-
munity than in flats or board-
ing-houses in* the city. He
introduced a scheme whereby
a few retired folk were allotted
building-blocks in the settle-
ment on which to build their
own cottages, using their own
capital plus a subsidy from the
Federal Government, which
now gives £ for £ for building
purposes to organisations pro-
“I’m sponsoring a move to have them all
called heavencopters.”
viding for the needs of the
aged.
Each of these people now
enjoys the benefits of the
B.S.L. community-life and
contributes to it according to
his or her special ability. They
will move into the service-flats
when they are no longer able to
look after their own cottages,
and eventually these cottages
will be occupied by those who
cannot afford to contribute
their own capital to the scheme.
Though there is still land
available at Carrum Downs,
this self-help scheme cannot be
extended any further there,
because it is not thought
desirable to have more than
150 people in one community.
Father Tucker hopes that
further areas of land will
become available for groups of
retired people with limited
capital to build their own com-
munities and live useful, happy
lives for many years. —Darcy

Tobacco Dangers
When, if ever, is the Federal
Health Department going to
inquire into the serious and
strongly supported allegations
that cigarette-smoking pre-
disposes to the onset of lung-
cancer? Admittedly the Com-
monwealth receives heavy
excise-payments from the ciga-
rette-manufacturers, and ad-
mittedly also the case against
cigarettes is “not proven.” Yet
there is such a weight of
medical opinion abroad on the
subject, supported by some of
the most eminent Australian
medical scientists, that an in-
quiry seems at least as justifi-
able as general research into
cancer.
If the vast sums paid in
excise for cigarettes have to
be used for hospitals and
medical care for men (and
women) developing cancer be-
cause of or in association with
their smoking of cigarettes, the
business hardly seems worth
while. The habit of smoking
is usually developed in youth
in an attempt to appear
“grown-up,” and is continued
because of addiction and as a
relief to nervous tensions which
seem to afflict millions of
people today.
Perhaps the best attack on
the habit would be to suggest
to the youth of the nation,
through schools and other
organisations, that it “isn’t
smart to smoke,” and that
abstention saves money for
cars, homes and equally dur-
able goods, as well as helping
to preserve life. — Well Cured

Perth Service-stations
Every visitor to Perth has
probably seen the big blue
neon-sign “We Never Sleep”
over Sydney Anderson’s river-
side 24-hour service-station,
only a few hundred yards from
the centre of the city.
That sign and the personal
efforts of Mr. Anderson have
defeated —for the moment at
any rate —the Westralian Gov-
ernment’s move to restrict
metropolitan service - station
hours.
The move was intended as
an Easter gift for the W.A.
Automobile Chamber of Com-
merce, which represents most
service-station proprietors, but
an appeal from Mr. Anderson
has prompted the Government
to postpone it indefinitely.
Premier Bert Hawke will
probably ask Parliament later
in the year to provide for
uniform petrol-selling hours
for all metropolitan service-
stations, without some of the
controversial points of the
present move.
The move began in 1955 with
the recommendations of a
royal commission into petrol-
trading. One of the recom-
mendations was restricted
hours for all metropolitan
stations, which was in line with
the Automobile Chamber’s
policy.
The Government decided to
take up the scheme and had an


amendment passed to the Fac-
tories and Shops Act providing
for hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
on weekdays, 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.
on Saturdays, and 9 a.m. to
noon on Sundays.
The metropolitan area was
to be divided into eight zones
and stations in each zone
rostered, one in each zone
taking it in turn to provide
emergency service up to 1 a.m.
The amendment was to be
proclaimed and put into prac-
tice immediately -after Easter.
Small service-station owners
applauded the scheme. They
maintained that with unre-
stricted hours a few stations
were staying open late, forcing
the rest of them to follow suit
if they wanted to stay in
business.
Perth’s handful of all-night
garages (Anderson’s is by far
the best-known and -patronised)
didn’t like the scheme ; nor did
the Royal Automobile Club
and the motoring public.
They claimed that if a pro-
prietor was enterprising
enough to serve the public in-
terest by staying open all night,
he should be allowed to. And
if other service-stations
couldn’t provide competition
that was too bad.
They liked the scheme even
less when it was- found that all
details of the rostering were to
be left to the Automobile
Chamber of Commerce, which
didn’t even represent all service-
stations, much less the R.A.C.
or the public.
Anderson, seeing his famous
neon-light growing dim, began
his campaign with a petition
asking that he be allowed to
continue his round-the-clock
service. Within a short time
he had 14,000 signatures—
many of them on copies of the
petition he inserted in the daily
newspapers.
Then he played his trump-
card —a promise made by
Chief Secretary Fraser in the
Legislative Council when the
amendment was under dis-
cussion just before Christmas.
Mr. Fraser’s words were:
I would not have spoken except
for the fact that Dr. Hislop raised
the question about certain indivi-
duals for whom we have some fellow-
feeling, because I think we could
erect a sign, in view of our labors
this week, which reads “We Never
Sleep.”
I want to assure him that these
people will not be interfered with
and there will be no restriction on
what they have been doing in the
past.
The result was th,at Premier
Hawke decided to honor his
Government’s word and post-
poned proclamation of the
amendment indefinitely.
The Government and the
Automobile Chamber will now
take another look at the whole
matter, while service-station
owners go on pleasing them-
selves what hours they keep.

Mt. Isa Railway
It is traditional now that
Townsville (Q.), in preference
to Bowen, became the starting-
point for the railway to
Charters Towers because Bob
Philp, a founder of Burns
Philp and Premier of Queens-
land, was also the member for
Townsville. Actually a line
from Bowen presented quite a
few engineering obstacles,
including two major bridge-
crossings of the Burdekin,
bridges over many other large
streams at their lower reaches,
and a series of mountain-
ranges to cross. And’the exist-
ing line from Bowen to
Collinsville has to be experi-
enced to be appreciated—in
about 30 miles between
Merinda Junction and Briaba
it climbs 1000 ft., including a
lift of 650 ft. in 15 miles.
The line, from Townsville
climbs only one range (between
Houghton Valley and Mingela,
where banker-engines assist it to
climb 380 ft. in five miles), has
only one crossing of the
Burdekin and no other streams
of any great magnitude in its
way. It is located near the
head of all streams between
Townsville and Hughenden,
and from there it generally
follows the Flinders River,
which has very few tributaries
flowing into it from the low-
rainfall downs-country to the
south. Indeed, few appreciate
just how well the early
engineers located this line.
A line from Collinsville
would, I assume, head for
Pentland to avoid climbing the
Great Divide on a new location.
As things are now this line
would have to swing south to
pass near Mt. McConnell to
avoid two crossings of the
Burdekin, but would still have
to pass over the Bowen and
Suttor Rivers and the Leich-
hardt Range.
With future expansion-
projects in mind this location
is out. We North Queens-
landers hope that the Federal
Government will assist our
State to build the Burdekin
Dam at a site near Mt. Mc-
Connell, where a wall contain-
ing 1,275,000 cubic yards of
mass-concrete, 150 ft. high and
3000 ft. crest-length, would
impound 6,275,000 acre-feet of
water —six times as much as
Sydney Harbor or greater than
the combined Snowy schemes.
It would irrigate one-million
acres between Townsville and
Bowen and have an electricity-
potential of 100,000 K.W.
If built, the ponded area of
about 300 square-miles will
extend well up the Cape and
Suttor Rivers. To avoid this,
any line between Bowen and
Hughenden would need to
deviate south to the latitude
of Mackay. To re-locate a
railway through hundreds of
miles of poor grazing-land,
crossing a series of ranges and
many large streams, would be
hard to justify with anybody’s
money. To bring the existing
installations up to a high
standard would not only be
easier and cheaper, but would
result in lower operating- and
maintenance-costs because of
their infinitely better location.

one-resident houses, mostly of
the three-bedroom type and
some larger. There are also a
number occupied only by
elderly married ’couples. One
schoolmistress kept her house
unoccupied when she was sent
to the country, a relative, living
near by, keeping an eye on it.
Another, big enough to house
two families comfortably, is
tenanted by a middle-aged
widow.
One citizen who lived in a
long-settled Sydney suburb
complained a while ago that his
little boy lacked near-by play-
mates. There was hardly a
young child in the immediate
vicinity of his" home. All the
houses were owned or
tenanted by elderly people
whose children were grown-up.
Many houses had only one
occupant.
It is not really selfishness
that causes such houses to be
under-occupied. Often the
elderly people who live ill
them could well do with the
income a tenant would bring.
It is the difficulty of getting
rid of an undesirable tenant
that is the basic cause of their
refusal to share their homes.
If the restrictions on eviction
were lifted as regards properties
where the owner can show his
genuine intention to live in
them, many houses now with-
held would be available for
periodical letting. Many now
occupying houses too big would
also sell and buy smaller
places. Terry the Torx

SAW MILLERS TIMBER MERCHANTS
THE COUSIN JACKS
By OSWALD PRYOR
r pHE real facts of the early
history of Cornwall are not
known, but Cousin Jack has
never lost any sleep over that.
He comes from a race who
dealt in the realm of fancy—
piskies, knackers, Jack-o’-
lanterns—rather than of facts.
The rich alluvial tin in the
creeks was no mystery to him ;
it was washed out of the hills
in Noyes’ (Noah’s) flood. And
so forth.
According to legend the
origin of Cornwall can be
traced back in antiquity to the
building of the Tower of Babel.
At that time there was only
one language. Then . the
piskies got to work and created
a confusion of tongues. No-
body could understand any-
body, and as a result, Gomer,
son of Japhet, son of Noah,
left the tower of Babel and
went west with his family until
he reached Britain, where he
settled in that part we now
call Cornwall. Gomer was
thus progenitor of the Cornish
race, thanks to the foresight
of Noah in building the Ark.
Cornwall, “a place near
England,” was isolated with its
own language and customs. It
hated intruders and was very
suspicious of strangers. It’s still
like that. During the war, a
gentleman who came down
from London to get away
from the bombing foand
sanctuary in a tiny fishing-
village. “Will I be safe down
here?” he asked a fisherman.
Eyeing him up-and-down, the
fisherman replied, “Whoy,
wha’s thee been up to?”
Visitors to Cornwall are
struck by the large number of
villages named after saints ; St.
Blayzey, St Just, St. Agnes and
St. Austell, to name a few. This
was a result of the coming of
Christianity to'Cornwall in the
sixth century. Before that
Cornwall was pagan, and relics
of pagan worship still survive
in the form of midsummer
bonfires.
This custom was one of
many brought to South Aus-
tralia in the late 1840’s by
Cornish miners who came out
to the Burra Burra copper-
mines ; and at Moonta, that
other Cornwall, the children
still keep it up after 90 years
without a break. In the early
days of the Burra, bonfire-day
was an official mine-holiday.
Mines in Cornwall were
given quaint names like Wheal
Mangle, Wheal Ding Dong
and Wheal Damsel. Wheal, a
Cornish word for mine, is in
the dictionary, but “bal,”
another Cornish word for
mine, is not. Girls working
on the tin-mines were known
as bal-maidens. The oldest
mine in South Australia, the
Wheal Gawler silver-lead mine
at Glen Osmond, employed a
few bal-maidens in 1847.
Bal-maidens in Cornwall
wore large aprons and calico
sunbonnets.- The kind of work
they did was called “bucking’’
and “spalling.” In bucking,
the pieces of ore were broken
down with a large flat-headed,
short-handled hammer, these
pieces having previously been
broken from larger pieces with
a heavy long-handled hammer
in the process of spalling.
The Cornish emblem is 15
bezants (yellow disks) on a
black background, but the
number of bezants has
no symbolical significance.
According to the College of
Arms in London it was chosen
merely because it could be
conveniently fitted into a
triangular shield in the order
5,4, 3,2, 1.
On the other hand there is
a story about King John, who
wanted to raise a loan for war
against France. He approached
five ' rich Cornish pawn-
brokers in turn, but the King’s
debts were enormous and too
big a load for one man to
carry. The five “uncles” then
decided to form a company
to be called The Ancient and
Honorable Society of Pawn-
brokers and to register a
trade-mark. But instead of the
usual three balls they had five-
times-three, with the motto,
“Fifteen Balls, One and All.”
Cornwall’s boast that it was
never conquered is not without
justification. The Romans
came to Cornwall but never
overran it. William of
Normandy conquered the
English but was never William
the Conqueror of Cornwall. In
the Civil War, the men of
Cornwall gave Cromwell’s men
their worst hiding, and if
Charles I had had an army like
them he might not have lost his
throne or his head.
A milestone in Cornish
history was the coming of the
Wesleys in the 18th century.
These two refined young
Oxford graduates wrought a
tremendous change in the lives
of the rugged Cornish miners,
many of whom turned from
smuggling and cockfighting to
religion. Some wanted a bit
both ways, and John Wesley
found it difficult to make them
, «■ •
see that smuggling and religion
Were incompatible.
A r. _ • _ n i,•
After visiting one of his
chapels at St. Ives, in 1753, he
wrote in his Journal, “I found
, ~. ~
an accursed thing among them:
well-nigh one and all bought
or sold uncustomed goods.”
Why is a Cornishman some-
times called a Cousin Jack?
Daniel Defoe gives an inkling
in A Tour through England
and Wales: —
They (the Cornish) are the most
sociable, generous and, to one
another the kindest neighbors that
are to be found, and as they gener-
ally live, as we may say, together,
tor they are always at one another’s
houses, so they generally intermarry
among themselves, the gentlemen
seldom going out of the county for
f or the ladies for a husband,
from whence they say, that proverb
upon them was rais’d (viz) That all
the Cornish gentlemen are cousins.
And, as Borrow notes, there's
a proverb, possibly Cornish:
“In Cornwall are the best
gentlemen.”

sign outside and pull-up to buy
fruit.
We like to think that the
Southerners are appreciative of
our granadillas and passion-
fruit ; papaws and pine-
apples ; custard-apples and
bananas. We like to sell them
delicacies such as rosella-jam,
although I had one torrid spell
persuading a Victorian that
“rosella” was not a trade-
name, but a jam made from the
calyx of a species of hibiscus.
It gives us pleasure to have
the same “regulars” call in
each year, and remark on the
progress of our little place, and
to hear the news of what is
happening • “down along the
line.”
All-in-all, we welcome the
tourist-season as a very effi-
cient stop-gap between the
main pineapple-crops. We
welcome most tourists, too, but
one member of the species is
barred.
The opening’ gambit is always
the same. “We're going back
to Adelaide” (or Melbourne),
they say. “Could you pack us
a nice box of papaws and
granadillas which will be ripe
when we get there?”
And they are crestfallen
when the answer is always the
same: “I’m sorry, but this is
a fruit-fly area, and it’s illegal
to carry fruit inter-State
that is, without an official
departmental permit.”
“But no one would ever
know,” they counter. And
from there the argument may
be short or long, but the issue
is ever the same: they don’t
get fruit to carry inter-State.
One South Australian, to
whom my wife explained the
implications of carrying fruit
which may harbor the fly, told
us: “Oh, yes! I know all
about it—they stripped all my
nectarines the last time they
had a clean-up in Adelaide —
they make sure it doesn’t get too
far down there!”
As tradespeople, I suppose
we should sell them the fruit,
on the principle that if they
don’t buy it from us they’ll
buy it elsewhere. As fruit-
farmers we just can’t sell them
fruit which might be the start
of an outbreak which would
wipe out many of our counter-
parts in other States.
Strumeta tryoni (the official
appellation for the Queensland
fruit-fly) is Number One pro-
hibited migrant on the inter-
state run. He’s catholic in his
tastes, and has been bred from
a range of hosts covering all
deciduous fruits, citrus,
papaw, mango, custard-apple,
granadilla, fig, date, banana,
and guava.
Take a look at that list and
you will see that he’s quite at
home from Adelaide to Cape
York. Even grapes are not
immune, although the maggots
seldom mature in a vineyard.
In North Queensland we
accept the fruit-fly along i with
the heat, the humidity, the
rates and taxes, and other odd
things sent to try us.
We provide a liberal diet of
D.D.T., practise orchard-
hygiene, and even mix weird
and wonderful lures which are
placed in traps to catch an
occasional Strumeta. Our
granadillas are raised in poly-
thene-bags, our bananas are
D.D.T.-dusted and raised in
hessian-covers, papaws are
picked at a stage of ripeness not
acceptable to the fly, and, all-in-
all, we manage to market fruit
which is, as near as humanly
possible, fly-free.
But there's always the odd
chance . . .
One granadilla landing in
Adelaide with the fly could
start an infestation which could
take away the livelihood of
dozens of fruit - farmers.
Strumeta’s morals are on a
par with his diet —they’re high,
wide and handsome, with a
complete life-cycle of a little
more than two weeks from
egg to adult.
Who knows where the recent
outbreak at Mildura started?
Probably by someone who
wanted to bring some of that
“lovely tropical fruit” back
from a trip, and carefully
wrapped a papaw up in one
of Dad’s shirts.
Although we keep our
orchards and plantations clean,
it is impossible to stamp-out
the fly, because, in addition to
his varied domestic diet, there
are dozens of host-trees in the
scrub to keep a reserve-pool
alive.
So we accept him, fight him,
and do our best to keep him
out of Victoria and South
Australia by warning tourists
of the danger.
But fruit can be bought in
shops without declaring from
which State you come, and
I’ll wager that many a customer
we’ve refused has bought green
papaws from the town-shops
and taken them through.
The Department of Agricul-
ture is reluctant to issue permits
to travel the fruit, and I have
it on good authority that the

are just as reluctant to admit
fruit, even though certified.
So the tourist is rather uphill
if he wants to take tropical
fruit back with him, short of
smuggling it.
And that’s what it amounts
to smuggling. Smuggling
what may or may not be a
tasty titbit for the folks at
home, but what is certainly a
potential menace to the
security of the home State.
Fruit-smugglers should be
treated as other smugglers:
they should be made liable to
extremely heavy penalties and,
to start with, an example should
be made of the first one caught
:ach tourist season.
A couple of years ago, in
The Bulletin, I suggested
heavy penalties for the illegal
planting of bananas in Queens-
land, following the outbreak of
the virus-disease “bunchy-top”
at Innisfail. Although not
accepted in toto, some of the
suggestions are now incor-
porated in the regulations, and
penalties are heavy for trans-
ferring bananas from one area
to another- without a permit.
Why? It was conclusively
proved that the Innisfail out-
break was caused by a back-
yard gardener who brought a
diseased sucker from the south.
“It’s only one little sucker—
it’s not worth filling-in a form
for!”
It’s only one very little fly,
half-an-inch across his wings
and less than that from the
tip of his antenna to the tip
of his pointed little “tail,” but
if you carry some of- his wife’s
eggs back home in that lovely
granadilla that you just
couldn’t resist, you’re not only
breaking the law you’re
endangering the internal
economy of the country.
So please, Mr. and Mrs.
Tourist, give us (and your-
selves —and the farmers in your
State) a break.

Fruit-fly in U.S.
“F.”: A report from the
U.S. is interesting in view of
Australian difficulties with the
fruit-fly. In Florida, as else-
where in the United States, the
Mediterranean fruit-fly has
caused a lot of damage to
citrus-crops.
There, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, the State
Department of Agriculture,
and growers, in close co-
operation, have been working
hard to. control damage by
fruit-fly, in the sort of intensive
campaign which practically
rid the United States of cattle-
tick.
A stroke of luck in the
campaign has been the success-
ful production of a synthetic
just when a very scarce oil
needed in the fight against the
fruit-destroying fly was running
out.
Angelica-seed oil had been
found very successful in insect-
traps, but the supply of
angelica-seed in the world had
almost vanished, and what
there was had become pro-
hibitive in cost. The synthetic
can be turned-out in whatever
quantities needed.
This means that the nearly
one-year-old campaign against
the fruit-fly is assured of
success, because a sufficient
supply of the new synthetic
is certain. The insect’s numbers
have already been drastically
reduced in all Florida counties
that were infested, and U.S.
Department of Agriculture
insect-control officials believe
the final clean-up stage is
beginning:
The new insect-attractants
are chiefly responsible for
success. First came the dis-
covery only a few weeks before
the insect was first found in
Florida in April, 1956, that oil
of angelica-seed is an especially
effective attractant for male
flies. Used in special fly-traps,
this oil made it possible to
determine quickly the extent
of infestation. This allowed
the control-measures to be
guided effectively.
Knowledge that the angelica-
seed oil-supply was very limited
led immediately to a full-
fledged research effort that
resulted in discovery of
the rather easily - produced
synthetic-attractant to replace
angelica-seed oil in the survey-
traps.
An aerial-spray programme
which was guided by findings
in the traps depended also for
its success on entomologists
developing bait-material which
could be mixed with the insecti-
cide malathion in amounts
deadly to fruit-flies but harm-
less to humans. This was a
yeast attractant-bait (enzymatic-
protein-hydrolsate). Because of
this attractant, used in the
spray, the spray itself does
not have to hit the insects.
They are lured by the bait as
it lies on vegetation in the
infested areas.
The campaign has depended
mainly on spraying from
planes, but it has also included
use of ground-operated mist-
blowers. The blowers apply
baited malathion where air-
craft-spraying is not practical.
In addition, granulated insecti-
cide—dieldrin—is applied to
the soil under trees known to
be hosts. The mist-blowers kill
the insects in the same manner
as the air-spraying. The appli-
cations to the soil destroy
insects entering or leaving the
soil.
Success depended on rapid
and accurate determination of
the presence of the Mediter-
ranean fruit-fly in any
particular area. Fifty-thousand-
odd insect-traps, first baited
with angelica-seed oil and then
—as this natural oil was
running out with the new
synthetic, furnished this
essential information. The
presence of Mediterranean
fruit-fly in any area was
revealed as the male flies were
attracted to the traps by the
lure of the attractant. State
and Federal entomologists in
charge of the campaign were
then able to concentrate their
aerial- and ground-sprayings
with malathion in the indicated
areas to kill the flies of both
sexes.
It was less than a rponth
before the Mediterranean fruit-
fly outbreak developed in
Florida that scientific workers
at U.S.D.A.’s Fruit Fly
Research Laboratory in Hono-
lulu, Hawaii, discovered the
value of angelica-seed oil as an
attractant. The oil’s only

important previous use had
been in liqueurs and perfumes.
It is derived from seeds of a
plant related to the carrot, and
its extraction' had been the
basis of a comparatively small
industry, principally in Bel-
gium. World production of the
oil had never exceeded 6001 b.
a year.
When it came into demand
for use in the fruit-fly campaign
in Florida, as much as 2001 b.
a month was needed, and it
was apparent that the available
supply would soon be
expended. In the speeded-up
effort to find a substitute for
angelica-seed oil, chemists at
U.S.D.A.’s Research Centre at
Beltsville, Maryland, discovered
a series of new acid-esters.
Tests at the laboratory in
Hawaii showed these would
attract the male Mediterranean
fruit-fly.
The isopropyl ester of
6 - methyl - 3 - cvclohexene - 1
carboxylic-acid proved most
effective, and was labelled
“ENT-21,478” to' distinguish it
from hundreds of other syn-
thetics -being developed and
tested. It was first made in the
Beltsville laboratories in the
quantities needed for field-
testing.
Found nearly as effective as
angelica-seed oil, it worked
better than any other materials
tried, and could be furnished
quickly in any needed quan-
tities on a commercial basis.
Far less costly by volume than
angelica-seed oil, the margin
of effectiveness the latter holds
over it can be overcome largely
by use of larger quantities in
each trap. It also has greater
uniformity and stability than
the natural attractant, since it
can be reproduced to an exact
formula.
The attractant properties of
both the original and the new
synthetic were determined
through continuing research by
U.S.D.A. entomologists. Ex-
perience with the Mediter-
ranean fruit-fly along with
similar work to control other
insects —such as the Oriental
fruit-fly and the melon-fly—
points to possibilities for more
effective insect-control.
Fertilisers and
Leaf-analysis
“Hop Scrub”: Developments
in industry and technology,
with a rise in the standard of
living in much of the world,
have made it imperative for
agriculture to adopt new pro-
duction-methods. Factors con-
tributing to improvements in
plant-industry include new and
better varieties from the plant-
breeders, mechanisation of
cultivation, improved pest- and
disease-control, better methods
of storage, and rapid transport.
The increased use of
fertilisers is not one of the
least of these factors. The
United Nations Year Book
gives the rise in fertiliser-use
since the pre-war period as
90 per cent.; and theie has
been a proportionate rise in
production.
Finding what a crop needs
in the Way of fertiliser is still a
big problem. In brief, it can
be overcome by the following
methods:
(1) Soil-analysis—the results
of which give relative values
only, due to various extracting-
agents used, and the availability
or otherwise of the elements
present in the soil.
(2) Field-tests with fertilisers.
Such experiments are costly
and time-consuming, but do
give the answers for the con-
ditions under which the experi-
ment is conducted.
(3) Leaf-analysis—a method
particularly suited to perennial
crops, as the quantity of
nutrients actually taken up by
the plant is determined, and
from this an assessment of soil-
status made.
(4) Microbiological tests of
organic-matter in the soil.
Leaf-analysis, particularly in
the field of citrus-fruit, has
become general practice in
U.S.A. and South Africa. So
far we have made little use of
it, possibly because spectro-
graphs are costly.
Citrus-trees require nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, calcium, plus the
“trace”- or “micro”-elements,
copper, zinc, manganese, boron,
iron and molybdenum.
A balance must be main-
tained between all these
nutrients, and there is inter-
action between them all. Exces-
sive use of nitrogen alone may
remove the other nutrients, so
that deficiencies result. Excess
phosphorus depresses zinc-
availability, and too much
calcium may limit potassium.
In South Africa, the agri-
cultural department offers a
"Just missed him, mate —he left here a fortnight ago.”
leaf-analysis service to all
citrus-growers.
The South African D. of A.
has, of course, information on
soil-types for each district, and
can use field-tests in conjunc-
lion with foliar-analysis if
desired.
Deficiency-symptoms in the
groves can be noted by the
growers—the yellow leaves of
nitrogen-poverty, the small
dark-green leaves slowly bronz-
ing, with the twigs dying, which
indicate shortage of phos-
phorus, the thickened and dis-
torted leaves, dropping pre-
maturely, with small misshapen
fruits, when potassium is
inadequate. Zinc - deficiency
produces the chloropic leaves —
“foliocellosis.”
Possibly a complete fertiliser,
_N.P.K. as 8:8:8, plus the
trace-elements, might result in
, spectacular improvement in the
trees, but as the growers’
object is to get maximum
Jesuits for minimum expendi-
ture, the problem should be
referred to the scientific,
workers of his local
department.
Don’t Overfeed Ewes
“Bilwon”: If you’re think-
ing of raising fat-lambs, don’t
overfeed the ewes.
Recent trials have shown
that, as a general rule, an oyer-
fat ewe drops a lighter lamb
than a ewe in just “fairly good
nick.” Although you may get
more twins, you'll lose more
lambs ; so you don’t win.
About a month before they
are joined, try to have the
ewes in forward store-condi-
tion. A flushing on green-feed
three weeks before and after
mating is the shot. After that,
turn them out on natural pas-
ture so you will keep them in
good store-condition,
Look-out for worms, though,
A thin, wormy sheep won’t
have much chance of rearing a

pastures or crops are not up to

ment. It will more than pay
for itself at this stage of the
game.
While it’s important to feed
at the right time, breeding-
ewes should never be allowed
to become dog-poor. It takes
too much out of them, and
time and food is wasted bring-
ing them up to condition
again.
Fat-lambs offer a lucrative
income for the chap who is pre-
pared to do the job properly.
But it’s a trap for young
players unless they are pre-
pared to use the right breeds
and go in for improved-pastures
or crops like lucerne. You
must have plenty of green-
feed to flush the ewes and for
that period before and after
lambing. Some today—none
tomorrow, isn’t good enough.
Another thing: both im-
proved pastures and lucerne
lend themselves admirably to
controlled grazing, and that’s
half the battle when you’re
trying to beat the worms.
Fattening Cockerels
“Billjim”: Tests at Para-
field (S.A.) have shown that
day-old cockerels, both cross-
breds and heavy purebreds, can
be brought to 31b. liveweight
at 10-12 weeks, thus producing
a reasonable return for amount
of feed consumed.
C. F. Anderson and M. D.
Jones, who conducted the
trials, used floor - rearing,
battery-brooders and battery-
weaners. The object was to
try out this equipment, to find
out the most suitable ration,
and the most suitable breeds
for the purpose.
The trials convincingly
demonstrated that, although
the initial capital-outlay for
weaner-equipment was higher
than for floor-rearing, the birds
in weaners gained slightly more
weight.
Birds reared without chaffed
greenfeed, but with vitamins
A and D 3 added to the ration,
showed no symptoms of
vitamin-deficiency. In most
instances debeaking was neces-
sary to control feather-picking
and wastage of feed. Feed-
conversion rates ranged from
3.81 b. to 4.61 b. of feed per
pound of liveweight-gain.
Feeds used in the experi-
ments, in addition to the special
vitamins, included crumbles,
pellets, chick-grain, and wheat
and oats. White Leghorns,
Australorps, Rhode Island
Reds, and crosses of these
breeds were used.
Oversowing
“Sundowner”: Four pre-
cautions will make the most of
money spent on seed and
fertilisers for oversowing by
broadcasting, sod-seeding or
disk-drilling.
These are: correct any
mineral-deficiencies, sow before
the soil loses its warmth,
remove last year’s surplus
growth, and create as much
surface-tilth as possible.
It must be remembered that
it is more difficult to establish
new plants on an existing
pasture than on a well-prepared
seedbed.
Time of sowing is of vital
importance. Later than the
end of April is risky.
See that the pasture to be
oversown is as open as
possible; if necessary, graze
heavily or mow just before you
are ready to start. In the
higher-rainfall areas, some
form of cultivation may still be
necessary, because of the thick-
ness of the sward.
As some competition from
the existing pasture will be
inevitable, a higher seeding-
rate than usual is desirable;
say, around 41b. of seed.
Pasture-growth
“Cotter”: Increasing the
growing period of plants,
and/or the palatability and
nutritious value of excess
growth, was far more important
than increasing the yield of
pastures during periods when
there was far too much for
animals to eat, anyway, claimed
W. M. Willoughby, of
C.5.1.R.0. Division of Plant
Industry, in a recent staff-talk.
Quite often, he said, animals
got so little value out of
apparently adequate amounts
of dry-feed that they had to
use-up mutton and beef to
remain alive.
Mr. Willoughby pointed out
'that, while it was a practical
necessity under present condi-
tions, conserving excess growth,
then feeding it back to animals,
was a negative approach to the
problem.
It replaced the comparatively-
cheap harvesting-functions of
the animal with expensive
machinery, which was used for
only a few weeks of the year,
and there was an enormous
wastage of fodder while it was
being stored, and, later, while
it was being fed-out.
Papaw Seed
“Papaya”:- Many N.Q.
growers are going to find them-
selves in the same boat as
“H.A.L.’s” Mildura settlers
(B. 6/3/’57) if they persist in
planting seed from any papaw
which just “throws a good
fruit.”
Papaws come in three types:
male, female and hermaphro-
dite ; all types can inter-seed,
and the separation of the
strains gives a professional
breeder a Mendelian headache.
Careful breeding and selec-
tion, and plain know-how on
the part of some commercial
breeders, have developed
certain fixed types which can
be relied on to throw true to
label, be they cannery- or table-
fruit.
After two-years’ experiment
we developed a Hawaiian-cross
papaw which appears to fill
the bill for the local market,
and many’s the quiet smile
I’ve had when a customer has
bought one with the comment,
“I must save_.the seed of this
one.” That seed is "likely to
throw back to any one of its
parent’s ancestors —in this
case a pure Hawaiian on one
side and my own dark secret
on the other.
Papaws are touchy as to
climate, too. A new grower
would be well advised to seek
seed from a local breeder
rather than go too far afield.
Our nursery is in the Cairns
area, and we never go further
than to Rockhampton district
when we acquire new stock.
“Started” trees, preferably
in tins, from a reputable,
Government-registered nursery,
are the best shot. Those who
would buy their own seed must
be prepared to pay anything
from 30s. to 40s. an ounce ;
otherwise they’re likely to
finish up with a paddockful of
“brumbies,” good for neither
fresh fruit nor cannery.
Sub.-clover Varieties
“C.A.A.”: Six strains of
sub.-clover are recommended
by the S.A. Department of
Agriculture for a wide variety
of soils and rainfall.
They are Dwalganup, Yar-
loop, Bacchus Marsh, Clare,
Mt. Barker, and Tallarook.
These strains cover districts
with an average rainfall of
from under-12in. to over-28in.
For wet, waterlogged soils,
Yarloop is by far the best,
while in districts where weeds
are bad both Yarloop and
Clare, which grow tall, will do
better than shorter strains.
Where the climate is too dry
for these strains, but weeds are
a problem, mowing and grazing
must be relied on to keep them
in check.
Soils which are rich in lime
don’t suit Bacchus Marsh, but
Clare and Dwalganup
will thrive in these soils.
For under -12 in. - rainfall
country Dwalga n u p and
barrel-medic are favored, while
all the others do well above
this figure. However, only Mt.
Barker and Tallarook are
advised for localities which
get more than 28in. a year and
have lime-free soils. In the
28in. areas rich in lime,
strawberry-clover is regarded
as the most suitable legume.
Farm Hints
“Granya”: Hydatids; prob-
ably the most easily-controlled
disease, is still a big danger
to humans and animals. Never
feed uncooked offal to dogs;
dose dogs regularly with
arecoline - hydrobromide and
make sure children wash their
hands thoroughly after playing
with dogs,*
“Tom”: Never throw the
carcasses of poultry that have
died to pigs ; if the dead birds
had T.B. the pigs will become
infected. If you don’t know
what killed them, call in a vet.
“Goschen”: Onion-weed —
bad around Swan Hill (Vic.)
and other districts —can’t stand
competition from good pasture.
Early cultivation, plus early
sowing of oats,, seems to be a
good first move in thinning a
stand of onion-weed.
“Nevada”: Keep sheep off
flowering stinkwort until the
weed dies-out. The tiny spines
in the flowers cause enteritis
and “pulpy-kidney” in sheep.

. . . this is of no importance
... In it we can take no
pleasure . . . that is why we say
Hindu religion is not
materialist —not like in west
where you boast of your
material civilisation. Very soon
now I take you to the Kashi
Vishvanath temple. Outside
the temple you see statue of
Ganesi. Ganesi is Hindu god
with head of elephant on man’s
body. Why Ganesi have
elephant’s head? I tell you . . .
In Hindu mythology”
And away he went on the
story of Ganesi and Parvati. By
now Howell was so flurried he
thought he ought to listen
because he was paying for it.
YjGHEN the car stopped the
driver opened the door
for Val, the guide for Howell.
“First of all,” the guide
began, “you must meet temple-
priest and he gives you
garland.”
“And what do we give him?”
“Just a token . . . something
small . . . maybe a rupee
each.”
Howell fingered the money
in his pocket. Then Val
reminded him of the story of
Gandhi and the priest at the
Kashi Vishvanath temple:
“You remember, dear, you
told me how Gandhi gave him
only a pie because he said the
priests were deceiving the
people.”
“Yes, dear, but people on a
goodwill mission can’t break
Indian conventions.”
Howell saw about as much
of the temple as a traveller
sees from a fast train. Anger
with his wife, the humiliations
he had suffered, kept distracting
him. The guide asked him
whether they would like to see
the Monkey Temple. Val,
wanting to protect him from
further humiliations, thinking,
too, of more priests with itchy
palms, put on her “sweet
nature” voice for the guide:
“Well, that’s really awfully
kind of you, I’m sure,” and
then she closed her eyes and
fluttered her eyebrows before
continuing. “But, really, I
don’t know whether we ought
to. You see, my husband and
I . . . We don’t believe in
God.”
“Ah, yes, I remember, your
husband, he simple boy from
the country.”
Howell did not like this. He
tried to explain that that was
not the reason at all—that he
had given up God after he had
left the bush, but this only
made him feel more foolish.
So he decided to tell him very
few people in Austrlaia
believed in God. But the guide
seemed even more astounded
by this:
“They not believe in God?”
he asked. “What then do they
believe in?”
Howell found it difficult to
tell him. “I’d like to see the
Monkey Temple even if my
wife doesn’t want to,” he said.
“Take me in.”
Val, however, had not lost
her grip. She was still able to
say without bite: “Slip the
garland on, dear—it may save
a rupee.”
But Howell was not at all
co-operative. “You don’t
“There, now — isn't it a help to know We're both such
bad sports?"
expect me to wear one of those
in the streets?” —and he
stamped behind the guide,
thinking perhaps a man could
enjoy India if he didn’t have
the nag, nag all the time. A
few minutes later he came out
of the temple with a garland
round his neck. Val was still
trying to be conciliatory:
“Well, dear, was it worth
it?”
“If you damn’ well insist on
measuring the worth of every-
thing by what it costs —well,
it cost six— six —rupees.”
“Six rupees?” Even Val
found it difficult to conceal her
shock.
“Yes, six—one for the
garland, and five for charities.
But I didn’t begrudge the five
—I made the priest promise he
would put it into his poor-
relief fund.”
As the guide shepherded them
down the ghats to the boat-
sheds past the beggars lolling
in the sun, the sadhus with
their long beards, and their
scanty clothing, he touched
Howelfis arm:
“Drop som*thing small into
a begging-bowl.”
“Two annas?”
“Maybe a little more. Maybe
eight annas.”
Just to make sure it was
enough, Howell dropped a
rupee into one of the bowls,
This brought a swarm of
beggars and sadhus round him
—boys, girls, women of all
ages, all holding out a bowl or
a hand and chanting: “Sahib,
sahib . . .” and looking plain-
live or pathetic. This angered
Howell. He appealed to the
guide :
“Tell those people we are
not wealthy Americans!”
“All right, sahib,” the guide
replied, looking at a boy wear-
ing a filthy shirt with the
bottom part in tatters —“I tell
them you are a poor man like
them—you have no money for
poor people.”
This made Howell feel even
worse than before.
“Just tell them . . . tell them
to go away !” And he pointed
majestically with the cherry-
wood towards the Ganges.
The guide coughed and sug-
gested nervously: “If the
sahib and the memsahib”
But Howell would not let
him finish:
“Look, for God’s sake don’t
call me sahib. It stinks, I tell
you, it stinks. Call me Jack.”
TLTOWELL’S heart sank when
he saw the boat, especially
the two makeshifts for oars,
just two flat pieces of deal
nailed on to the end of round
poles.
“If you don’t mind,” he


said courageously to the guide,
"I’ll row the boat.”
The guide and the two
rowers thought this was a huge
joke—a sahib rowing a tourist-
boat on the Ganges. They
grinned at Howell, who felt
obliged to grin back. The
trouble was they continued to
grin when Howell began to
grunt over the oars, which —•
trust her to do it —was the very
moment Val chose to ask him
whether he needed a rest, and
when he refused, and a great
grunt tumbled out after his
rather fierce “No!” she chose
that moment of all moments
to tell the guide that her hus-
band, her Jack (for Jack he
was now, as the guide reminded
her) was a famous rower in
Australia, that he and seven
other rowers, with a special boy
to steer them, had won all the
races . . . (“Only one, dear”)
well, not quite all the races in
Melbourne, one of the big
cities in Australia —almost as
big as Bombay. The trouble
was the guide could not under-
stand why they needed to have
eight men, or why they should
row so far. By this time
Howell’s grunts were so loud
they could not be ignored. So
Val put her hand on his,
imploring him, please, please
to be sensible and stop, but.
Howell, with grunts between
each word brushed her hand
off, saying:
- “A man who has stroked a
Head of the River crew . . .
I was saying for a man who
has stroked a Head of the River
crew . . . this is a pushover!”
“Yes, but you should be
seeing the sights, dear.”
“I’ve told you before . . .
[long pause] compared with
the Head of the River”
Soon the boat simply did not
move when he rowed,
“I’m flogged, dear.” And
he lay down plumb in the
centre of the boat, breathing
like a frightened fish in a rock-
pool. Way, way in the distance
he could hear the voice of the
guide: “Hindus like to die on
Ganga. And why do Hindus
like to die on Ganga? I tell
you. All Hindus believe if
they die on Ganga their souls
go straight to Paradise”. . .
What poppycock, Howell
was thinking. No wonder your
towns are a bloody disgrace to
humanity, and most of your
people look as though their
clothes haven’t been washed
for a year. What this country
needs is not food or foreign
experts, but a great huge cake
of soap.
Before he could put the idea
to Val the guide bent over him
with his lips almost touching
his ear. That was another
thing he had against this
bloody country—this physical
intimacy from the men: it
made you feel you had got
mixed up with a pack of
queens.
"When the boat come back
to bank, sahib ... so sorry, I
mean Jack . . . you pay the
rowers,, just a little apprecia-
tion” . . .
Howell groaned.
ecstasy ; but all that memory
has clearly preserved is the
single, miraculous impression
of trampling all day through
the water, like walking in liquid
song ; and —proving that even
then I must have had essentially
the fisherman’s eye, which must
always be hunting while it is
drinking-in joy—that I found
a lot of freshwater mussels in
one long shallow run where a
kind of river-grass grew under
the glittering surface.
As it happened I did not,
after all, learn to fish for trout
in the Town Creek, where in
all other respects my aquatic
life began. Fred Vincent, that
mighty fisherman, his face a
mask of wrinkles like a
clown’s, took me with my
father one evening to the
Waingongoro, to teach me the
high art; and I dare say did
very well for me, though I still
recall, with indignation now
tempered by amusement and
understanding, for he was a
very keen fisherman, that when-
ever a trout rose to a fly he
shouldered me aside from the
water and had a go at it
himself.
But it was in the Town
Creek that something of the
first, of the most vital import-
ance, happened, not long after
Fred Vincent had shown me
how to tie a cast and bait a
worm on the hook and some-
how, without too much con-
fusion, swing it out over the
water.
Just upstream from the
swimming-pool and near the
reach where the mussels lived.
1 dropped my worm into a
nice wide pool; and, behold,
incredibly, a small brown-
trout, yellowish as he turned,
swam breathtakingly, superbly
towards it . . . like something
in a dream, magnificent, fully
half-a-pound in weight; and
he was going to take it! And
swam towards it, and swam
towards it, and swam towards
it —and then heartrendingly
darted away from it. And after
him, curiously, swam an eel,
about 3ft. long. Maybe the eel
frightened him; maybe,, with
some convulsive jerk of the
worm in the irresistible impulse
to strike too soon, I did.
That was the end of him,
and I had to fish for two whole
seasons before anything so
exciting happened again. But
what matter? A trout had
looked at my worm. I was a
fisherman. Wherefore, little
Town Creek, I thank you.

The Rose-heetle Man
Book Society “choices” are by no
means always the choicest reading in
the world, for the Society has to go
on “choosing” week after week and to
cater for many tastes; but if ever a
book thoroughly deserved its selection
it is Gerald Durrell’s My Family and
Other Animals (Rupert Hart-bavis).
About his life as a boy on the island
of Corfu, at once an amusing sketch
of his family, as fascinating as a novel,
and a combination of travel-book and
Nature-book, it is one of those rare
books in which every page is sparkling
with life and gaiety. It might be com-
pared —paying both a high compliment
—to Noel Monkman’s “Escape to
Adventure,” and it is also not unlike
some of Colette’s enchanting auto-
biographies.
As an instance of the sort of thing
with which it is filled you might take
the Rose-beetle Man, whom young
Master Durrell met on his rambles in
the mountains: —
I could hear him long before I
could see him, for he was playing a
rippling tune on a shepherd’s pipe,
breaking off now and then to sing a
few words in a curious, nasal voice
.... His dress was fantastic, and on
his head was a shapeless hat with a
very wide, floppy brim. In the band
were stuck a fluttering forest of
feathers: cock-feathers, ~ hoopoe-
feathers, owl-feathers, the wing of a
kingfisher His pockets bulged,
the contents almost spilling out;
combs, balloons, little highly-colored
pictures of the saints, olive-wood
carvings of snakes; camels, dogs and
horses, cheap mirrors, a riot of
handkerchiefs.
This extraordinary character
carried on his back bamboo cages,
full of pigeons and young chickens,
several mysterious sacks and a large
bunch of fresh green leeks. With
one hand he held his pipe to his
mouth, and in the other a number of
lengths of cotton, to each of which
was tied an almond-size rose-beetle,
glittering golden green in the sun,
all of them flying round his hat with
desperate, deep buzzings, trying to
escape from the thread tied firmly
round their waists.
Mr. Durrell himself has as many
curiosities to offer as had this strange
dumb pedlar with the beetles in his
bonnet: his pet pigeon named Quasi-
modo, which, having been bred in
captivity, refused to learn to fly and
walked wherever it went, changing to
a dance measure when it heard a waltz
on the gramophone; the wild swallows
which gave the same fastidious atten-
tion to the toilet of their young as
does the lyrebird; the naturalist named
Theodore who once had to lead a
triumphal march of soldiers into
Smyrna, mounted on a white charger
which bolted when someone threw
eau-de-Cologne in its eyes; the tortoises
pushing up from the earth in spring,
like stony flowers of the mountains,
and mating with ridiculous difficulty;
the painters and writers who came to
stay, including the bald countess in
the crimson wig; the wonderful court-
ship-dances of the scorpions, “waltzing
slowly in circles among the moss
cushions,” and the consternation at the
dinner-table when somebody tried to
light his cigarette from a matchbox
full of pet scorpions; the pet owl who
bit the dogs, and the pet magpies who
called the fowls to dinner so often
that they nearly drove them demented;
the nights of swimming by moonlight
when they rubbed shoulders with
porpoises in the phosphorescent water
and fireflies lit the shore . . .
But this, except perhaps for the bald
countess, is merely a list of curiosities
of Nature; and though, being an expert
naturalist, Mr. Durrell does write cap-
tivatingly on this subject, at least half
the charm of his book comes from its
human side, the picture of his family,
their guests and the wild peasants and
villagers from Corfu.
There is the brother who wrote
books and hated natural-history, and
fell into the bog when he went shoot-
ing; the brother who shot everything
in sight, including, in the middle of
the night, burglars; the sister who fell
in love with a- tutor and. when he was
chased off the island, took to her bed-
room and refused to come out until
the novel-writing brother, having got
drunk on brandy as a precaution
against catching cold after falling in
the bog, set the house on fire; and,
pervading the whole story with a
slightly worried charm as she tries to
control her ebullient and inconse-
quential family, there is. the* mother—
with her gardening, her cooking, her
patient acquiescence when the family
insisted on moving to a larger house
because they had invited too many
guests and then to a smaller house
because an aunt threatened to come
and visit them, her tranquil solution of
all problems, great or small.
What, for instance, was she to do
when her pet terrier bitch, Dodo, who
adored her too much ever to leave her
side, gave birth to a puppy which she
insisted on carrying round with her
in her mouth wherever Mrs. Durrell
went?
The unfortunate baby hung from
her mouth by its head, its body
swinging to and fro as Dodo waddled
along at Mother’s heels. Scolding
and pleading having no effect,
Mother was forced to confine herself
to the bedroom with Dodo and her
puppy The solution to the prob-
lem that Mother eventually thought
of was simple. She hired the maid’s
voungest daughter to carry the puppy
for Dodo. She pottered from room
to room like some Eastern potentate,
Dodo pattering at her heels, and
young Sophia, tongue protruding
and eyes squinting with the effort,
bearing in her arms a large cushion
on which reposed Dodo’s strange
offspring.
This is the ideal way to write an
autobiography: close to the earth, and
all memories mellowed by time into
grace and comedy. It is altogether the
most delightful book this reviewer has
read for months.
Medieval Architecture
The latest addition to the Pelican
History of Art, Architecture in Britain,
Middle Ages, by Geoffrey Webb, is an
enlightening volume.
The present reviewer was brought
up to believe that during the Dark
Ages, which, according to the his-
torians, began with the fall of Rome
in 476 and more-or-less ended six
centuries later, a pall of spiritual,
intellectual and artistic blackness
descended over Europe. The arts of
Greece and Rome completely vanished
along with their wisdom, and the more
civilised a country had been the more
it was benighted.
But here is Mr. Webb saying that
the eyidence of the Great Hall of Tara
shows that buildings of the grandest
scale were constructed in Ireland quite
early in this age of darkness; in fact,
halls of a length of 750 ft. were not
unknown there. None of them survive,
since they were built of timber, as were
most of Britain’s buildings; but it was
not long before the stonemason
replaced the carpenter, and the remains
of scores of stone churches, fortresses,
priories and abbeys testify to the
mason’s skilful craftsmanship.
In Lincoln Cathedral, Tewkesbury
Abbey, St. Alban’s and scores of other
glorious buildings the masons, carvers,
gilders, slaters, glaziers and painters
worked mainly anonymously. The
name of the man who introduced the
full glory of the Gothic into England
is only known by the accident that he
fell off the scaffolding of Canterbury
Cathedral and was so badly injured
that he was compelled to return to
France. He was William of Sens, and
he was replaced by an English master-
mason also by the name of William.
In the 13th century a new order of
mendicant friars started roaming
around the country preaching. They
had to be provided with halls com-
mensurate with the spiritual importance
of their message, and out of that simple
fact arose the soaring beauty of
Lavenham Church, Suffolk, and a
dozen other parish fanes illustrated in
the Pelican volume.
Rabelais was probably responsible
for the popular idea of a monk of the

Dark or Middle Ages. The typical
monk was supposed to be a lazy,
lascivious wine-bibber with a red nose
and an enormous stomach who divided
his interest between food and women,
and it is difficult to understand where
such an individual could have found
time to direct the orgy of building
which obsessed the Middle Ages
people. Rabelais was a monk him-
self, but, though a great writer, he no
doubt took the glorious edifices in
which he lived and with which he was
surrounded very much for granted.
F.S.
"Meanjin"
An article by Dr. H. V. Evatt on the
mural of the trial of Socrates sculpted
by Tom Bass for the Wilson Hall at
Melbourne University, an article by
Tom Bass on “Sculpture and the
Modem Movement,” and a poem by
Max Harris on the Tantanoola tiger
are highlights of the latest “Meanjin.”
Dr. Evatt is chiefly interested in the
mural as “an eloquent and insistent
demand for freedom” ; Mr. Bass seems
to emphasise too much Rodin’s
“geometry” at the expense of what
was really far more important, his
magnificent feeling for life—surely the
exquisite curves of “Le Baiser” or the
volcanic surge of his Balzac are some-
thing more than “mathematics.”
The Max Harris poem, a most
interesting attempt to put an Aus-
tralian legend into plain, prosaic verse,
needs rhyme to make it as memorable
as it should be:—
Until the day Jack Heffernan made
camp
By a mob of sheep on the far slope
of Mount Schanck
And woke to find the tiger on its
haunches,
Bigger than a mountain, love, or
imagination,
Grinning lazily down on a dying
ewe . . .
Other contributions include Brian
Elliott on the novels of Martin Boyd,
reviews of European film festivals, and
poems by Judith Wright and Randolph
Stow.
Crime in New England
Murders are so rarely committed in
Australia, at least in fiction, that there
should be a special welcome for Come
Back to Murder, by S. H. Courtier
(Hammond), in which a sinister and
beautiful woman gets killed in the
bush near an old mine-entrance after
she has thrust herself upon the lead-
ing family of an N.S.W. New England
town.
The family lives in a mansion on a
mountain on top of the old mine ; and
how does the noseless man get so
quickly from the top of the mountain
down into the mine-shafts, and why
can the sinister woman have expected
to marry the family’s son-and-heir?
It all happens during an Aus-
tralian back-to-the - old - home - town
week. The basic plot is ingenious, but
the characterisation and scenes are
international with, alas, only a dash of
Australian flavoring.
There should be some local interest,
too, in Death in a Mist, by Elizabeth
Salter (Bles). Miss Salter, an Aus-
tralian living in London, who was
Entertainments Officer for the Waaafs
in N.S.W. during the war, has set this
detective-story in a New Zealand
boarding-house for visitors to the
sulphur - springs. The question,
becomes: who threw old Maori Mrs.
Conway into the boiling geyser?
There is her weak adopted son,
Cyril, and Stephen, who walked-out on
the ancestral Conway property to be
an artist, and an assortment of guests,
including the Blunts, who had been
wronged by the old lady, and Miss
Fielding, who had curious ideas ; and
there is the curse that old Mrs.
Conway’s grandfather had pronounced
upon her mother when her mother
married an Englishman.
The story is well sustained with mad
midnight visits to the spouting geyser,
and almost everyone in turn seems to
have done the murder until at last the
true culprit is unmasked.
As a New Zealander who has
previously used the same ever-obliging
geysers for a detective-story, Miss
Ngaio Marsh might well be mentioned
in the present company, though her
Off With His Head (Crime Club) is set
in England.
The village blacksmith and his five
sons are the guardians of the
immemorial ritual-dance which they
dance with swords at the Manor once
a year. The blacksmith, who as Tom
Fool acts having his head cut off, is
found in the shadow of the ancient
stone, when the tune comes for his
“resurrection,” with his head truly off.
He has quarrelled with his halfwit son,
with the German woman student of
folk-lore, with the young lawyer who
acts “the Betty” in the ritual-dance,
who wants to marry his grand-
daughter ; and the ex-airforceman son
of the grocer, who dances “the Horse,”
wants to turn his ancient smithy into a
garage, an ambition shared by the rest
of his sons.
Working tirelesly over the details
of the dance, Miss Marsh manages the
difficult job of familiarising the reader
with every minute of it by the time her
Inspector Alleyn is ready to reconstruct
the crime and name the murderer —a
complicated mystery which in subject
and method reminds one of some of
Dorothy Sayers’s best efforts.
