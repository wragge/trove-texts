DISTANT VIEW
WE SEE that entertainer Barry
Humphries has returned from England,
where he has been for the past three
years, to present a program which will
te l us just what we are like. Has
Will Rushton thought of staying here
for three years and then going back
to England to tell them what they are
like?
GLORY ROAD
PICTURES of the Governor of New
South Wales with a group of officials
standing in drizzling rain on a platform
above Sydney’s new Warringah Express-
way declaring the $25-million, l-]-mile
stretch of road open seemed rather as
if they might be stills from a not very
brilliant revue. The Warringah Express-
way, unfortunately, isn’t built for
laughs.
The expressway is working quite
well, despite what one paper called
teething troubles,” which sounded as
if, when it is working perfectly, it
might devour everything which gets
in its path. The expressway is a fine
stretch of road. Give the N.S.W.
Department of Main Roads $25 million
and they can give you a splendid mile
and a half of road. It’s just difficult to
see how it got there.
Basically, the expressway carved
through three or four inner suburbs,
well suited to high rise development
and within a few minutes of the city, in
order to cut travelling time by any-
thing from two minutes to seven for
people going to the unsewered splendors
of distant suburbs. But, as the Depart-
ment made clear during the Padding-
ton inquiry, it is their job to build
roads and let the citizens fall where
they may.
The expressway may eventually go
through to some of these distant
suburbs. On the other hand, it may
not. The western distributor, through
industrial areas mainly, has to be built
first. (For some reason the Warringah
Expressway, designed to get private
motorists to their homes, had a higher
priority.) It will be many years before
the next stage goes ahead — and the
political pressures begin to show purple
bruise marks — now that they are
flinging bridgework across Woolloo-
mooloo for the Eastern Suburbs Rail-
way.
At the city end of the expressway is
the Harbor Bridge, which cost
$9,577,503, less than half the price of
the expressway. What a new bridge
would cost is impossible to estimate,
but the matter is rarely discussed. It
may come up for an airing more often
now that it is shown that the Warringah
Expressway, first stage, is not the solu-
tion to all problems.
Bridge toll in 1966 yielded $3,873,326.
If bridge revenue had not been diverted
to projects such as the Warringah
Expressway the toll could have been
abolished some time ago. What it looks
like from where we are standing is that
they have to build $25,000,000 express-
ways to cut down on the delays caused
by people stopping to pay toll which
pays for expressways.
So'me schools of thought suggest that
every motorist stopping, fumbling, and
waiting for change does not slow down
traffic flow. Commonsense says it must.
As long ago as 1960 Professor W. R.
Blunden suggested that savings in time
and expenditure could be made by hav-
ing double-fee, one-way toll. Nothing
ever happened about this, nor about his
later suggestion for electronic equipment
costing about $600,000 (as near as we
can understand reports of it, this would
mean that if one driver stops to scratch
his knee, the equipment stops those
coming behind doing the same thing),
but this has never been tried.
All this tends to make the Warringah
Expressway take on the fantasy quality
of its companion across the water, the
Sydney Opera House. Themis even the
added joke that it has been given the
wrong name: it is called an expressway,
but has a maximum speed of 35 miles
per hour.
However, everybody seems entirely
satisfied with the Warringah Express-
way. It may be that where Utzon and
his followers went wrong was in trying
to build something both beautiful and
useful. If you build something ugly no
one will care if it’s not much use.
LOVE AFFAIR
IT IS NOW seven months since John
Tasker lost his mystifying power
struggle with the Board of Manage-
ment of the South Australian Theatre
Company which culminated in his
dismissal as the company’s director.
He had held the post since the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust formed the
company in 1965 as part of its long-
term plan to establish regional theatre
companies in all States. And his dis-
missal had a certain illogicality which
was never explained away successfully.
Tasker is at present in Sydney
directing the New Theatre’s production
of “America Hurrah,” the first play
he has done since his work for the
South Australian company. He has
spent the intervening months writing
and directing television films for the
South Australian Labor Party in
fact, he wrote a shooting script for a
campaign film for the Millicent by-
Picture by ROBERT WALKER
John Tasker with one of the huge dolls used in “Motel,” the third part
of “America Hurrah”
election shortly before coming to ‘
Sydney.
When he finished work with the
South Australian Theatre Company, he
was offered the Directorship of the
Canberra Repertory Theatre, but
refused it in order to stay on in
Adelaide, where he has bought a
house.'
“I’ve got a kind of running love
affair with Adelaide, and when I have
a love affair I don’t end it. If it’s
going to end, it breaks up around
me.”
For a while, the affair seemed prom-
ising. Don Dunstan, then Premier, had
ambitious plans for Adelaide’s cultural
future, and in the meantime, Tasker, a
dedicated Dunstan supporter (“he’s the
kind of man who makes you inter-
ested in politics”), was busy working on
political films for the government.
“Then we had that election,” he
shrugs with more bitterness than resig-
nation, “and all those plans for
Adelaide have been shelved.”
So, prompted by his excitement

over Jean-Claude van Itallie’s “America
Hurrah,” Tasker is temporarily at the
New Theatre. “I suggested the play
to them because I thought they’d be
the only theatre with guts enough to
do it. You know, rights for the play
have been around since September,
and I believe it’s disgraceful that no
professional theatre has taken it up. It’s
not as if they haven’t heard about it—
Walter Kerr, Pinter, Robert Brustein—
all kinds of people have said what an
important play it is. But I think it
frightened them. There’s so little work
here that directors lack the freedom to
fail, so they’re afraid to experiment.”
“In ‘Motel,’ one of the three one-
acters which make up the play, the
motelkeeper goes on describing the
joys and pleasures of her motel while
two strangers go on destroying it
around her. It’s a little like Hubert
Humphrey campaigning on a platform
of joy and happiness while riots and
assassinations happen around him —
America allowing herself to be
destroyed with a Doris Day smile on
her mouth.
“And Australia’s like that in certain
ways, too — we allow our rights to
be whittled away — in fact, welcome
it as long as it’s a strengthening of
the status quo.”
He will not enlarge on the story of
Tasker versus' the Board, except to
say that six actors have left South
Australia in the past four months.
“I’m not saying I was responsible for
building the theatre up, but when I
went there only two actors could
rehearse during the day, and by the
time I left ten actors were working in
the theatre during the day. Now six
of those have left.”
After “America Hurrah,” his own
future plans are indefinite, although he
believes another six months with the
advertising agency which produces the
ALP political films might be bene-
ficial. (“A few more directors should
work in advertising — might teach
them how to sell the theatre better.”)
And he still wants to remain in
Adelaide.
“It might look like a one-sided love
affair at the moment, but I know
there are people who want me to stay.”

Bolte will ban liquor from milkbars.
The Victorian Government had unwit-
tingly extended the milkbar swill fro’m
six to ten, but now, after strong agita-
tion from many responsible bodies, the
loophole will be closed. Sir Henry
assured Victoria that his Government
had not intended the anomaly to occur.
His quick action follows the removal
only two years ago of the hotelkeepers’
responsibility to keep coffins handy for
guests and stables ready for their
horses.
"NEW STATESMAN" SILLINESS
THE BRITISH magazine “New
Statesman” has, in recent issues, been
talking about Australia’s involvement in
Vietnam with a quantity of venom, a
lack of knowledge, and a degree of
silliness which might depress many
Australians who, although their views
on the subject may differ, know at
least that it is exceedingly complex.
In the June 14 issue Paul Johnson’s
London Diary claims that “every week
I receive fresh evidence that her
involvement in Vietnam is eroding
Australia’s standards of justice and free
speech.” “Democracy is dying in this
country,” wrote one Australian reader
to “New Statesman.”
However, if this reader furnished
Johnson with the account the “New
Statesman” gives of the affair of con-
scientious objector Simon Townsend,
his reading of Australian papers must
be sketchy. Johnson recounts the nine-
foot-square cell, one-pound loaf of
bread, and canteen of water a day bit,
then goes on: “His guards bang on his
door every 30 minutes from 7.30 p.m.
onward to prevent him from sleeping.
The authorities don’t even bother to
deny these accusations. The Army
Minister, Mr. Lynch, admits that ‘this
is the punishment normally given to
soldiers under sentence in these cir-
cumstances’.”
There the story finishes, leaving the

impression that Townsend’s punishment
is accepted and continues. As we know,
the papers and Parliament jumped on
Army Minister Lynch, the punishment
was discontinued, Townsend’s appeal
has been heard by a magistrate, and
he now is a free man. It might not
be perfect democracy, but then it’s
not a perfect world.
However, although Johnson does not
give his readers the end of the Towns-
end saga, he has space for moralising:
“As I have pointed out before, Viet-
nam is the great corrupter of the arro-
gant white men who invade her . . .
now the Australians, too, are allowing
the Vietnamese madness to infect their
priceless inheritance of British civilisa-
tion.” It would be unfair to go back in
history and mention the British as the
arrogant white invaders of all time,
but we may wonder from Mr. John-
son’s piece whether part of that price-
less inheritance of British civilisation
was a regard for truth.

DON’T ASK John Ulm, Qantas’
public-relations man, how they chose
the Prominent Women for this VIP
trip round the jet maintenance base at
Mascot. The social pages, he supposes,
hell, they wouldn’t inquire into how
many dollars their husbands were pull-

degrees and things, presupposing they
had any, that is. But he does think the
phrase an unfortunate one, you know,
when he was a cadet journalist they
weren’t allowed to use prominent
women. Never mind. The point is,
prominent or not, it’s women who do
most of the deciding about travel, and
it’s most important they should know
about things such as, thougih t!he aero-
plane is thought to be light, you know,

ference room in hangar 96, rejecting
sandwiches and biscuits, much too early,
thank you, sipping coffee, puffing men-
thols, and Mr. Scott’s doing his techni-
cal stuff very nicely beneath two sepia
photographs of past Qantas hierarchy.
And everyone’s thinking, poor man,
stuck with a lot of women. And he’s
thinking, well, at least this gets me out
of that rotten meeting ‘ . . . and when
you get to what I call the nuts and
bolts department” his department,
murmurs Pat Tudor, the Commercial
Promotions Officer, he loves it, it’s him
—“you’ll be amazed how clean it is.
Most ladies scream and think they’ll
ruin their clothes.” Ah, now Mr. Scott
thinks this a most interesting figure.
He flips a card and reads “110,000,000
gallons of fuel are used every year.”
Unbelievable, everyone breathes. Actu-
ally, Mr. Scott gets this job about once
every two months and says if you did
it more often you’d go —stale. “Well,
Doug,” says Pat Tudor, who’s a great
big girl with a deep, penetrating voice,
“I think it’s time for the kitchens.”
. . . through Customs and Excise
hangar, where everything from elephants
to fish comes through. Fish: they’ve a
new way of packing them, tight into
plastic bags and fill ’em up with
oxygen. When Mr. Scott travels to San
Francisco he takes 201 b. of beef sausages
with him, and tea, and beef extract, for
staff with frustrated Australian palates
. . . and into the kitchens.
Mr. Bell, labelled Catering Super-
intendent Flight Services, waits at
attention by the door. And a Prominent
Woman screams, oh, it’s awful, she’s
just seen the darlingest of baby pigs
with its stomach slit up, she can’t bear
to look at it, it’s too young. Yes, says
Mr. Bell, we’re stuffing it with mush-
rooms. And everyone looks wide-eyed
at 50 dozen boiling eggs, the man who’s
cooking them looks wide-eyed back, the
tons of bread rolls, the salad, and, good-
'ness, it’s all right for first-class pas-
sengers: they have their .apples polished.
The Procurement and Supply Man-
ager, Mr. Howell, is waiting. Yeah, it’s
an unfortunate title, everything’s so
Americanised and everyone jokes about
his procuring. Supplies worth
$26,000,000 are stashed away here and
Mr. Howell doesn’t know what they’d
do without his pipe system, which cost
$20,000 to install and through which
orders are shuttled. Well, actually, this
is all getting a bit technical, and some-
one says it reminds her of David Jones,
the way it was with bills and things
whizzing about, also some Prominent
Women are wishing they’d eaten a
sandwich, after all. And one hopes that
some time has been allocated for the
lavatory? But there’s still Mr. Scott’s
nuts and bolts. It smells like a dry
cleaners. He forgets this on holiday,
and when he returns it hits him full
force and he smiles and says, aaaaaaah,
I’m home again. And the climb up a
43ft. aeroplane tail to give the ladies a
new angle on a Qantas jet. And that
baby jet to case and be photographed
by. And the simulator and training
planes with Mr. Heards in specs and
a fag, confounding everyone with the
cost of it all: $1.67 million and $B9O
an hour to run. You’d think he was
paying the bills. “You can’t stop him
once he’s started,” says Pat Tudor,
“he says ladies are most appreciative.”
Righto, everyone. Martini-time. Thank
God. The lavatory at last.
The tour ends with lunch in a mock-
up cabin with Qantas’ hierarchy and
everyone gets a gold cardboard box
containing one Qantas tie, a scarf, scent,
cocktail sticks. Seven prominent ladies
totter home. One is violently ill. Don’t
ask John Ulm how they chose her.
"Oh, it’s awful...the darlingest of baby pigs with its stomach slit”


The man America needs
COMMENT
“Observer” was going to write on the American Presidency this
week, but since he finds that the London “Economist” has just
said what he believes, he yields his space to this condensation of
“The Economist’s” editorial.
ONE MAIN TASK of the next Presi-
dent of the United States will be to
pursue a policy of domestic reform
Which will reduce the chances that he,
or any other American leader, will get
himself assassinated. That is not simply
a sick exaggeration. Senator Kennedy’s
murder was a reminder that the United
States suffers from the disease of
violence much more seriously (about
five times more seriously, in terms of
the homicide rate) than most other
advanced countries. This is nothing
new. It is explained partly by ancient
provisions about the right of the Ameri-
can citizen to bear arms. Its elevation
into making assassination a political
weapon is also explained partly by the
strength of passions in a country built
up by people who migrated there for
the specific purpose of creating, each
according to his own ideas, a better
society for himself. One reason why
people in Europe are less violent about
their politics is that their expectations
are lower. But it is also fair to say
that the pressures that have made
American society the richest in the
world carry their own neurotic side-
effects in far too many walks of life.
It is a problem that faces all indus-
trial societies. It will soon confront
those European Communist societies
which are now deliberately introducing
a greater degree of competitiveness into
their economic life precisely because
they 'want to be more efficient. It
already faces all capitalist ones, whose
dynamism and whose tensions spring
from the same roots as America’s. It has
to be solved if the capitalist system and
the degree of personal liberty that
seems to accompany it are not to
appear in history as an effective way of
making more and more material goods
for a madder and madder world. For
many reasons —not least that, willy
nilly, it is the Americans who lead the
liberal world—it matters most that the
problem should be solved in the United
States. When one suggests, half seriously,
that the next American President’s first
job will be to stay alive, one is saying
that his first priority must be the crea-
tion of a society in which it will be
possible to start dissolving the tensions
whose extreme symptom is murder.
This requirement will be piled on top
of the other gigantic problems that face
any occupant of the White House. The
Vietnam War may still be with him
next January, and it would be foolish to
suggest that the need to complete the
job of building the right sort of society
in America itself absolves the Americans
from the responsibility to take an in-
terest in creating the conditions for a
better life for the people of southern
Asia. That is what the American com-
mitment to Asia is about. America’s
relationship with its European allies, too,
is still to be redefined. Beyond these
are the creaks and groans of the world
monetary system—and the widening gap
between rich nations and poor which
has not been made less menacing by the
ritual obeisance daily paid to closing
it. Yet the next American President
may well conclude that the biggest
challenge is within the gates.
This implies certain qualities in the
President. It does not, curiously, imply
a great deal of imagination. The exist-
ence and nature of America’s domestic
problems are vastly better understood
today than they were before John Ken-
nedy came to office. No President, and
not many Americans, will be unaware
that there are acute problems of color
and poverty. Solutions, too, have been
offered, though there is much less agree-
ment on them. Here a presidential can-
didate can choose where he puts his
emphasis in his speech-making, but the
eventual President will be impeded if
his demagogic bias has been a Right-
wing one.
The next President must also be a
man who can attract and organise an
effective team around him. It is here
that Mr. McCarthy’s claim to the job
is weakest. A doubt remains about his
ability to gather, around himself, and
to lead, the sort of brains-trust that
made John Kennedy’s administration the
best in any large country since the war.
Mr. McCarthy is a loner; on this test,
he comes out less well than Mr.
Humphrey or, probably, Mr. Nixon.
In general, the effectiveness the next
President should be looking for will be
in applying solutions rather than identi-
fying problems. He needs McNamaras
more than Galbraiths. Yet the kind of
effectiveness he needs is not exactly the
kind that Mr. McNamara excelled in.
The Ford Motor Company and the
Pentagon can be run on a basis of
rational decision-making springing from
adequate information. But the right
choice in domestic politics is not neces-
sarily something logical.
It is tolerably easy to get politicians
to support obvious solutions to obvious
problems—and even to vote the money
for them. This is a possible approach
to America’s domestic problems it
might be Mr. Nixon’s but it is not
the kind of approach that will solve
them. Yet, on the other side, a Presi-
dent who takes the course of trying to
remove' causes rather than symptoms
will have a temporarily harder time.
The massive effort needed to give black
Americans a fair chance in life may
be approved in principle but is not
going to be widely popular in practice.
The next President may not require
great intellectual imagination, but he
will require what could be called poli-
tical imagination: the ability to under-
stand the problems already identified
for him, to believe in his chosen solu-
tions, and to present his feelings to the
American people, whose support he
needs no less than that of their repre-
sentatives. This is not 1933; yet one
can feel that the United States needs
a man who will have the same effect as
Roosevelt had then and as John
Kennedy had in 1961: one who will
make the nation feel that it has set out
on a new, and necessary, course.
That need not mean a united nation
Roosevelt was deeply hated just as
he was deeply admired but it means
one united enough for those who mis-
trust innovation to give the new Presi-
dent the benefit of the doubt (which,
rather than in the rare intervals of
consensus, is how most advance occurs).
It also means that it is America’s
poor, and particularly its black poor,
who need to be reconciled even if this
means taking more taxes from the com-
fortable suburbanites. The President
cannot lightly afford to be at odds with
more than a section of what could
crudely be called the ruling class; but
he and his country can afford that better
than they could afford to leave the
leaders of the black community out in
the cold.
Nor can America afford to see the
intellectuals and the young idealists who
have flocked to Mr. McCarthy’s sup-
port entirely left out in the cold. The
striking thing about Mr. McCarthy’s
student supporters is that they have not
rejected the system but tried to make
it work in the direction they believe in.
In America, a man is needed who can
harness the forces of impatience as ably
as he can prod forward those of caution.
Mr. McCarthy’s appeal to responsible
idealism is his greatest source of
strength. If it were not for the doubts
about his ability to run the power-
house of the Presidency, and the fear
that he might be a weak President,
he would be a very attractive candi-
date.
There is one trouble with this pic-
ture of a leader who combines sympa-
thetic understanding with a genuine
idealism and political horse-sense and
the skills of organisation. On present
form, there is no one who wholly fills
it. The man who in many ways ca'me
nearest has just been shot. The other
man who might have done it sits,
crippled by half-rational hostility to
his person and his policies, in the Presi-
dent’s chair already. Of the three men
who seem to be possible candidates
far November, Hubert Humphrey at
present seems the best. But he will need
to escape from the anaesthetising effect
of the Vice-Presidency; he will need
to show that he can build up teams of
advisers of his own, preferably drawing
many from the bereaved Kennedyites’
ranks; he will need to convince the poor
and the Negro and the unhappy and
the idealistic that his heart is where
he says it is.

Gorton comes down
off the top of his head
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
PRIME MINISTER John Gorton may
at last be .escaping from the thrall of
Sir Robert Menzies, something that
Gorton’s immediate predecessor, the
late Harold Holt, was never able to
achieve. For, paradoxically, Menzies,
one of Australia’s finest speakers, had
a blighting effect upon the parliamen-
tary and platform performances of both
men.
Gorton turned in a very creditable
performance at last week’s National
Press Club luncheon when he reported
on his visit to Singapore, Malaysia, and
Indonesia, and upon the pattern of
Australia’s future defence planning and
programming. He was lucid, concise,
well prepared, and in control of both
his subjects and their presentation.
Missing were the waffling, imprecise,
and poorly expressed thought lines that
had evoked derision (and delight) in
the Labor Opposition and uneasiness
among his own followers, whose elec-
toral future, to a large degree, depends
upon their leader’s public image. He
could not announce decisions, or hard
policy lines, but explained clearly and
convincingly why he could not.
The Government was responsibly try-
ing to assess what would be the position
in South-East Asia, not next year, nor
the year after, but five or six years
hence when happenings, as yet only
contemplated (such as British with-
drawal from Singapore and Malaysia),
will have actually happened. It was a
speech which, if he had handled it
badly, could have brought him under
heavy criticism. As it was, he produced
something that closed a lot of loopholes
through which potential critics could
have fired mercilessly.
It is not due exclusively to lesser
skill in handling words than was
possessed by Menzies that both Harold
Holt and Gorton came under fire for
the inferior quality of their speechmak-
ing. Neither man tried to imitate
Menzies’ speaking style. But both tried,
with a notable lack of success to imitate
what they both apparently hypnotised
themselves into believing was his off-
hand approach to a major speech.
Menzies’ gift was the ability to make
a carefully prepared, carefully thought-
through speech sound extempore, as
though, while he was actually standing
on his feet he was thinking aloud, and
effortlessly producing a logically
reasoned series of arguments to justify
a Government policy, or to condemn an
Opposition-sponsored thesis.
Menzies was amazingly frank about
his speech-making habits. He under-
stood the necessity for a political
Leader who wishes to maintain his
credibility with the electorate to ex-
press himself understandably and with
simplicity.
He regarded (accurately I believe)
the major function for a Prime
Minister who wishes to continue in the
office as the broad overseeing of
administration and the making of
decisions. To him, the explaining and
defence of decisions was nearly as
important in a democratic community
as the making of the decisions.
Menzies really worked hard on a
significant speech, often taking days
to think through his subject and reduce
it to clear, comprehensible terms. This
habit of his had a secondary value. It
put him in a position where he could
make seeming “off-the-cuff” statements
that really were a carefully reasoned
policy line.
But such was his superb style that
even people who knew that the con-
trary was the truth mesmerised them-
selves into believing that Menzies could
dash off a major speech without pre-
paration or forethought. It is possible
that he could, but he was too shrewd
a political warhorse, however reckless
he might have been in his earlier years,
to follow such a course in the years
of his success.
Menzies had another idiosyncrasy
which worked upon the self-esteem of
his two successors to their disadvantage.
He had pride in his distinctive style,
and would not permit anyone to work
upon the draft of a Menzies’ speech.
Personally, I have always felt that
provided the thoughts and policy lines
contained in a speech are those of the
speaker, there is no shame in securing
the assistance of persons trained to
improve clarity and style. The late
President John Kennedy was as lucid
a speaker and writer as there has been
in modern politics. The thoughts con-
tained in his speeches were unmistak-
ably his. Yet Kennedy had a team of
speech-writers.
Not that I am suggesting anyone
wrote Gorton’s speech to the National
Press Club. As far as I know it was
exclusively Gorton’s, though I repeat,
there would be nothing wrong, pro-
vided the ideas and thoughts were the
Prime Minister’s, in having others
participate in the shaping of the
speech.
But Gorton did escape from what
could possibly be the subconscious
desire to emulate Menzies by speaking
off the top of his head. If the con-
version is permanent, Gorton could be
on the way to eradicating what has
emerged in the few months of his
Prime Ministership as his largest weak-
ness his practice of appearing to say
things without sufficient preparation,
and off the top of his head rather than
from the depths of his mind.

AUSTRALIA
The week John Gorton put his
reputation on the line
MOST OF THE criticisms of Prime
Minister Gorton’s performance
dissolved last week following his
address and question-answering at
the National Press Club in Canberra.
Most commentators voted it the best
public appearance of his career. He
had a lot to say and he said it well.
For the first time he began to dispel
the feeling that he lacked a sense of
where his own Government was going,
through fuzzing every issue in order to
keep all options open.
Mr. Gorton confirmed what The
Bulletin had already reported: that a
major strategic is now
being made in the Defence Department,
to be completed by August, so that a
new three-year defence plan can be
finalised by November. By pointing up
its importance “There has been a
fundamental change in the basis on
which Australia’s strategic planning has
for more than two decades been pre-
dicated” Mr. Gorton has put his
reputation on the line. He is now very
firmly committed to the idea that in a
changing international environment,
greater Australian initiatives and
regional self-sufficiency seem an inevit-
able development. For, if there is one
certain conclusion to the strategic
reassessment now going on in Can-
berra it is that involvement of great
powers in economic aid and defence
in the South-East Asia region will be
related directly to the degree of self-
help and regional solidarity which can
be developed.,
There is a feeling in Canberra that
Mr. Gorton was influenced consider-
ably by his talks in Singapore with
Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and in
Djakarta with President Suharto. Mr.
Lee’s independent and tough-minded
views are well known and have often
been reported. But President Suharto,
in the low-key pragmatic style of post-
Sukarno politics, has been an enigma.
However, in a Press conference with
Australian journalists accompanying Mr.
Gorton (not reported by the dailies due
to cabling difficulties), he gave some
clear indications of the way he is think-
ing about the future of Indonesian
foreign policy.
He described the threat from China
as “very important,” pointing to politi-
cal subversion and military infiltration
as the two main techniques by which
the Chinese were attempting to domin-
ate the region. He said that an Ameri-
can military presence on the ground in
Asia was not enough: “The realities we
can now observe in Vietnam resulting
from the presence of American forces
do not give us a guarantee of security
in this region. That is why I am con-
vinced that the security of this region
must be in the hands of the people of
the region themselves. It is of great
importance that the Australians and
the other countries of the region are
going to protect themselves.”
Stressing the importance to Indo-
nesia of finding time in which to
“create capabilities in the fields of
politics, economics, and society,” so
that its Government can “lift the con-
ditions of our people” and counter the
threat of subversion, President Suharto
said that at this stage his Government
thinks that regional co-operation should
be mainly in the “fields of economics
and other cultural activities,” but “it
is necessary and most important to have
an exchange of information regarding
security information and intelligence.”
He also said that he had spoken to Mr.
Gorton about his wish to get Australian
assistance in military training, and that
he thought an enlarged exchange of
military personnel would “contribute
to a better capability in the defence
forces of each country.” Australia’s
military arrangements with Malaysia
and Singapore did not create any con-
cern, Australians not being regarded
as outsiders.
Ironically, President Suharto’s idea of
the appropriate foreign policy for
South-East Asia turns out to be much
closer to the developing American
policy for this region than Mr. Gbr-
ton’s early theme, that the region is
composed of a number of small powers
which depend for their survival upon
an all-American defence shield behind
which they can solve their develop-
ment problems. In fact, Mr. Gorton
has probably discovered that there is
something of an Asian-American
consensus developing. Mr. Lee, the
Thais, the Malaysians, and the Viet-
namese share this approach. Which
puts powerful constraints on Australian
foreign policy.
The Vietnamese Government put to
Mr. Gorton the point that Australia’s
main contribution to its struggle must
be diplomatic. They stressed the
psychological nature of the present
stage of the fighting, and said the main
The Prime Minister ...“a fundamental
change”
contribution Australia could make was
political.
With this in mind, Mr. Gorton in
his Press Club address spoke of the
“considerable military sacrifice” in-
volved in the unilateral American con-
cession of limiting the bombing of the
North. He pointed up the “nagging
fear among all with whom I spoke
(in Vietnam) that there might be, in
Paris, some further military concessions
without reciprocal concession by the
North Vietnamese which would under-
mine the morale of the armed forces of
South Vietnam and of the population.”
He mentioned the “very great build-up”
of North Vietnamese troops in South
Vietnam, and warned of the likelihood
of spectacular new assaults by the
Communists.
Taking a line much closer to that
of the Vietnamese Government than
the American, he expressed scepticism
about the Paris talks—“talks which it
is all too easy to describe as peace
talks, but which, in fact, are not peace
talks but merely preliminary talks
to see whether there is the basis for
the negotiation of a just and lasting
peace, talks which regrettably have, so
far, made no discernible progress.” He
indicated a view that the fighting on
the battlefield was most likely to deter-
mine the final outcome: “I believe,
given sufficient will, that the military
objective of obtaining political free-


dom for the people of South Vietnam
can be attained.”
The crystallising of Mr. Gorton’s
views on South-East Asian defence has
important political significance. In the
weeks before his overseas tours,
incipient rebellion was developing
which could have caused Mr. Gorton
serious trouble. Key Ministers like
Mr. Hasluck and Mr. Fairhall were
privately expressing concern at the
trend of his policies as well as his
casual style of policymaking. Liberal
backbenchers were virulent in their
criticisms. And the DLP was talking of
Mr. Gorton as positively Cairnsian in
his approach to defence matters, cer-
tainly to the Left of Mr. Whitlam.
They were laying all sorts of complex
plans for a campaign of guerilla war-
fare against him from their under-
ground bases in the Senate. These three
groups did not show any signs of
coalescing to threaten Mr. Gorton
frontally, but if the movement had
developed momentum it could have
eventually done that.
The general feeling in Canberra is
that by his National Press Club speech
he has, if not disarmed the rebels, at
least caused them to suspend their
harassment.
Cultural relations
Making Australia
better known
IN 1963, when Japanese Prime Minister
Ikeda visited Australia, he produced one
of the normal gestures of friendship,
almost a diplomatic platitude: he pro-
posed a cultural agreement between
Japan and Australia. But in the Can-
berra of 1963 other people’s platitudes
were Australia’s novelties. Sir Robert
Menzies would have nothing to do with
it. The furthest he would go was to
agree to a reference in the official com-
munique to a joint desire to promote
cultural relations, and the furthest the
External Affairs Department was
allowed to go was to send Mr. A. B.
Jamieson, an old Japan hand, to Tokyo
as Australia’s first cultural attache.
A certain amount has been done since
then in the way of exchange between
Australia and Japan, but the Japanese
have been half-hearted about it. They
haven’t yet forgiven the knockback they
received in 1963. The same is true of
India, which has wanted more formal
arrangements about cultural exchange
but hasn’t got them.
Australia is expected to get more
seriously into the business of cultural
exchange now that Indonesia and Aus-
tralia have entered into a formal cul-
tural agreement, signed at the time Mr.
Gorton was in Djakarta. (See “Com-
municating,” page 64.)
The next ministerial meeting of
ASPAC will announce the formation of
a regional cultural centre in Seoul to
The 1968 Australian Ballet Company tour of 10 Asian nations was Australia’s
most ambitious cultural gesture
which Australia will be expected to con-
tribute. And cultural agreements are
likely with other countries. The Govern-
ment is almost certain to be forced to
think more seriously about how much it
is prepared to spend. It won’t be any-
thing like the $l5O million President de
Gaulle puts into flooding the world with
French books and keeping a horde of
artists, academics, and teachers on the
Government 'payroll. But with countries
like Germany spending about $4O mil-
lion, the British $25 million, and Singa-
pore $5 million, Australians are
obviously going to be up for something
extra.
The External Affairs and Prime
Minister’s Departments are now com-
bining in putting to Cabinet proposals
for putting a bit more purpose into the
job of making Australia better known
abroad. There is now a clearer recog-
nition of the importance of cultural
relations as an element in general rela-
tions with the world. But, Australia
being Australia (viz., a nation of
European origin set in a South-East
Asian neighborhood), the job is more
complicated. In Asia there is the task
of dispelling ideas of Australians as
racialists who are contemptuous of the
history and cultures of the other coun-
tries in their geographical environment.
In Europe and there is
the rather different task of trying to
provide evidence that Australia does
actually belong to European civilisation.
In both areas there is need to dispel the
idea of Australia as nothing but a pro-
vincial British backwater.
Up to now, effort toward these ends
has been unco-ordinated and lacking
the official recognition which can be
conferred by a set of cultural agree-
ments. The export and import of cul-
ture is handled piecemeal by a variety
of agencies. Education Minister Mal-
colm Fraser recently returned after
having headed a “Cultural Mission” to
Italy and his Department publishes
“Hemisphere,” a journal devoted to
Australian-Asian relations. It also ad-
ministers scholarships to Asian students.
The News and Information Bureau of
the Department of the Interior produces
pamphlets and films on Australia for
distribution abroad and looks after the
visits of officially sponsored foreigners
while in Australia. The Prime
Minister’s Department runs a range of
cultural relations, matters ranging from
ballet and orchestral tours to catering
for visiting VIPs. The External Affairs
Department has recently set up a
cultural-relations branch of half a
dozen officers to examine submissions
by private organisations for Govern-
ment assistance, to choose foreign-
opinion leaders to be brought to Aus-
tralia on tour and to co-ordinate
arrangements with Australian embassies
abroad. The Department of Immigra-
tion, with a large publicity section,
attempts to do a great amount of
Australian-image building in Europe as
part of its efforts to interest potential
immigrants.
So far as the Indonesia-Australia
agreement is concerned, its special im-
portance is that Australia chose
Indonesia as the first nation with which
to sign such an agreement and Indonesia
chose Australia as the first nation with
which to sign such an agreement since
the Sukarno period. But beyond this is
a symbolic significance: the two neigh-
boring countries that are in all the
world the most dissimilar in culture and
history are now making a planned effort
to understand each other. If these two
countries make a good job of it, this
is something in which all the world
could be interested.
The Nuclear Treaty
Departmental
fission
AUSTRALIAN GOV E R NMENT
policy on the Nuclear Non-prolifera-
tion Treaty is as unresolved as ever.
Influential Ministers and Departments
representing different interests are still
urging opposite courses of action.
The External Affairs Department,
heavily supported by its Minister, Mr.
Hasluck, is the main exponent for Aus-
tralia signing the Treaty. The Prime
Minister’s Department and the Defence
Department, talking mainly through
Mr. Fairhall but backed strongly by
the Department of National Develop-


Hasluck and Fairhall ... fascinating split
ment and the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, are against Australia signing.
The Hasluck-Fairhall split fascinates
Canberra observers, because on most
issues these two senior Ministers work
closely together.
The External Affairs Department is
of the view that any failure to sign
would seriously affect Australia’s rela-
tions with the United States and
Britain, and give unnecessary propa-
ganda ammunition to those who want
to paint Australia as a potentially
aggressive power. They also claim that,
by not signing the Treaty, Australia
would forgo free access to nuclear tech-
nology for peaceful purposes and we
would have to work alone or with a
non-signer such as France or India.
They did argue at one stage that Aus-
tralia’s relations with Indonesia might
be jeopardised by failure to sign, but
this claim has been undercut by events.
In their speech at the United Nations,
the Indonesians expressed most of the
same reservations that Australia ex-
pressed and backed up many of our
arguments. Critics now suggest that the
Indonesians might even respect Aus-
tralia more if it did not sign the Treaty,
seeing in this a display of Australia’s
capacity for acting independently of the
U.S. and Britain.
Mr. Fairhall’s view, quite simply, is
that the future of this part of the world
is so uncertain that Australia cannot
afford to renounce the option of de-
veloping nuclear weapons. A keen
technology man, he believes that the
forces of scientific development will
ineluctably lead to the spread of nuclear
technology and that no Treaty can
prevent it from being diverted to
possible military use.
Others supporting Mr. Fairhall
attack the Treaty as “quite phony” (in
the words of one official). They say it
is not enforceable—because military
establishments are completely immune
to the Treaty’s inspection safeguards.
And that in any case the inspection
safeguards are a completely unknown
quantity because they are not specified
in the Treaty. All that signatories to
the Treaty are pledged to do is to pro-
ceed to negotiate with the Interna-
tional Atomic Energy Commission to
get an agreement with them about safe-
guards. So at this stage there is only
speculation about the nature of inspec-
tions. The Australian Atomic Energy
Commission has raised the spectre of
hordes of international inspectors run-
ning all over Australia’s installations,
some spying for their Governments,
others selling commercial intelligence,
and all of them gumming up their ad-
ministrative works. At another extreme
some think the inspections are likely
to be quite perfunctory, but also in-
effective.
In either case it is argued by Mr.
Fairhall’s supporters that the Treaty
is not worth the paper it is written
on, if it is signed without any clear idea
of the likely effectiveness or nuisance-
potential of inspections.
Mr. Gorton’s position is not yet
fixed. Earlier on he was inclined to
support Mr. Fairhall’s views, and he
authorised the very tough speech which
the Australian UN delegate made in
May.
But the Americans have been apply-
ing heavy diplomatic pressure on Aus-
tralia to sign and some reports have it
that when Mr. Gorton was in the U.S.,
assurances were made that Australia
would finally come to the party. But
Canberra officials are adamant that no
such undertakings have been gitfen and
that the question is open.
Mr. Gorton himself seemed to con-
firm this at the National Press Club
luncheon. He reiterated the reservations
expressed at the UN and gave no in-
dication that any of the Australian
doubts have been resolved in the mean-
time: “We have voted to commend it
and it is open to signature. But we
would wish the answer to a lot of ques-
tions we raised to our own satisfaction
before we would sign what we com-
mend in principle.”
Universities
When CAF was CUF-ed at Monash
ALMOST SINCE it started, Monash
University has been the centre of the
radical movement in Australian uni-
versities. It lived up to its reputation
when radicals took control of the elec-
ted Student Representative Council and
got the votes for its dissolution.
(Attempts have been made to rescind
that.) The radicals intended to put to
a mass meeting proposals for a new
system of student government, based on
frequent mass-action meetings and ad
hoc committees of activists. A students’
political affairs committee was to be
formed.
This was an attempt to formalise a
situation where the elected SRC has
increasingly been overshadowed by
radical groups emerging out of militant
meetings. The movement got a real
start early in the year when Vice-
Chancellor Matheson announced that
the university’s discipline statute was
being amended to allow the Univer-
sity to penalise students for misconduct
off as well as on campus. That was a
readymade issue for militants. Claim-
ing it as an attempt to stifle free
speech they (not the SRC) organised
a protest meeting which was attended
by about 2000 of the University’s 8500
students. The new disciplinary measure
was overwhelmingly condemned, but a
proposal for “confrontation” with the
Vice-Chancellor in the administration
building divided the meeting evenly.
Since there was no means for count-
ing votes, the militants, using the loud-
speakers, announced that all who sup-
ported them should join in their
struggle with authority. They led
Vice-Chancellor Mat[?]son of Monash


several hundred in a sit-down which
paralysed the administrative building of
the University for an hour. During the
sit-in, a group of students, mainly
Labor Club and New Left, but includ-
ing two DLP Club and two Liberal
Club members, formed an organisation
called the Ca'mpaign for University
Freedom (CUF). They met the Vice-
Chancellor, who told them that if he
were a student he would be worried
about the proposed off-campus discip-
line. He agreed to negotiate with the
CUF.
Encouraged by this preliminary suc-
cess, the CUF worked during the May
vacation to organise further students’
meetings. The Left-wing majority with-
in the organising group proposed long
sit-ins and attempts to take over the
University Council chambers before a
scheduled meeting. They declared:
“The Vice-Chancellor cannot fob us
off again with talk about sympathy. He
must give a clear answer or he will
be fought.”
The DLP representatives then put to
CUF a manifesto laying down four
principles. The first three related to the
right to free expression for all, but
claimed that this would only be
destroyed by violence, whether direct or
provoked. The fourth had it that only
the elected SRC had the right to speak
on behalf of all students. The committee
rejected this and the DLP and a
number of Liberals broke away. They
incorporated their principles in a new
organisation, the Campaign for
Academic Freedo’m (CAF).
CUF-organised meetings refused to
allow debate on CAF non-violence pro-
posals. Finally, Vice-Chancellor Mathe-
son undercut CAF by agreeing to meet
CUF demands, declaring that he will
go to the University Council and oppose
the discipline amendment he originally
initiated.
South Australia
The swing to Dunstan
IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA the factors
leading to the Australian Labor Party’s
fairly comfortable victory in the Milli-
cent by-election are not at all clear-
cut. Both the main parties had made
electoral reform the central issue, with
the ALP maintaining that its 48-seat
plan would give an equitable demo-
cratic redistribution. The plan was said
to allow the Liberal Country League
to govern with 48 percent of the total
State vote while Labor would need 50
percent. The LCL for their part told
the Millicent voters that the ALP
scheme would deny country people the
effective, weighted representation they
would enjoy with the LCL’s 45-seat
plan.
But down in Millicent electoral re-
form was only one of a number of
issues concerning the voters. In the
fishing town, where in March they had
lost heavily, there was a decided and
crucial swing back to the ALP, indicat-
ing that the March vote had been
more against the then Labor Govern-
ment than against Des Corcoran him-
self.
Earlier, Corcoran’s campaigners had
learnt that somehow the fishing-control
legislation passed by the Dunstan
Government last year had been credited
to the Premier, Mr. Steele Hall, who
as leader of the Opposition had visited
the area often. Corcoran’s efforts were
thus largely directed at getting the
record straight in the fishermen’s minds.
In the township of Millicent again it
was probably more a matter of personal
support of a popular townsman which
gave Corcoran his greatly increased
majority there. It also showed on one
level the good sense of his organisers,
who made the ALP campaign more a
matter of winning friends and influ-
encing neighbors’ votes than high-
powered political polemic.
While Martin Cameron, the LCL
candidate, claimed that the State would
not have stable government if the LCL
lost Millicent, Corcoran, for his part,
made great play on the fact that the
Government would not fall if he were
elected, but that a vote for him was
more a vote for the future. Speaking
shortly after Cameron had conceded
defeat, Corcoran even publicly thanked
those voters who had voted for him
personally rather than his Party.
The ALP’s win at Millicent leaves
the South Australian House of Assembly
again evenly divided, with the Govern-
ment depending on the Speaker’s cast-
ing vote. It is precisely the situation
the LCL did not want. It is committed
to electoral reform, but to achieve this
the State Constitution will have to be
altered by an absolute majority of
Members of both Houses. Thus the
Opposition will have to agree to any
redistribution measure the Government
puts forward.
Mr. Hall announced prior to the by-
election that he would take the Milli-
cent results as either an endorsement
of his redistribution plan or as a direc-
tion to compromise with the ALP. But
it is hard to see how the ALP could
compromise much further, for it has
already announced that it will allow
some country electorates to be below
the overall electorate quotas.
Again it is not at all sure that
the Legislative Council would agree
to a scheme which will radically
change the balance of country
representation in the Lower House.
The LCL-controlled Council has, in
the past, shown quite clearly that it is
prepared to act independently of the
Lower House and far more openly in
favor of electoral privilege. However,
militating against such possible intransi-
gence will be not only pressure for
reform from the public generally but
also Dunstan’s declared intention to
push for a general election as soon as
possible.
This is an astute move, for after
some 70 days in office the Hall Govern-
ment has a somewhat lack-lustre image.
As the boundaries stand now, each
month sees new houses erected in, the
outlying city areas, traditionally LCL
country seats, but now slowly turning
into dormitory suburbs for industrial
workers.
It is ironically possible that within
two years and perhaps before then
both the Premier’s electorate of Gouger,
containing the suburb of Para Hills,
and the Minister of Lands’ electorate of
Alexandria, containing the new Rey-
nella-Christies Beach industrial area,
could be lost in a general election
owing to the inflow of Labor voters.
Time either way would seem to be on
Dunstan’s side.
Hall. .. compromise

OVERSEAS
The coming Japan-U.S. clash?
WITH POLLING due on July 7 in
the Japanese elections for their Upper
House of Councillors, Japanese-
American relations are at a particularly
low ebb.
Uncertainty concerning future de-
velopments in these relations is prob-
ably best accepted as one of the Asian
scene’s facts of life. Nonetheless, these
two facts are scarcely unrelated.
For what is significant about the
current manifestations of anti-
Americanism in Japan is the fact that
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party,
led by Prime Minister Sato, has felt
the need to trim their electoral sails to
the breeze created by a series of unfor-
tunate and certainly ill-timed incidents.
In January a visit to the port of Sasebo
by the nuclear carrier U.S.S. Enterprise
triggered some of the most violent
student demonstrations of the decade.
More recently, the visit of a United
States nuclear submarine to Sasebo
coincided with an increase in radiation
levels in the port area. On top of that
a United States Phantom jet crashed
into an uncompleted new building on
the Kyushu University campus earlier
this month.
So, while naturally incidents such as
these stoke up the anti-American fires
in the ranks of the ideological and dog-
matic student Left, as well as arousing
hostility from the largely pacifist
and anti-nuclear Japanese Centre, they
have also served to create a wider
sense of unease, which, to judge from
recent remarks of Cabinet Secretary
Kimura and the campaigning speeches
of Sato himself, has made an impact on
the normally pro-American Right.
To American inability to keep their
considerable military presence in
Japan as inconspicuous as possible,
especially at election time, must be
added tbe fact that the incidents have
not 'been well handled. Were the
Americans less concerned to push
Japan in the defence direction they
think she ought to go and more willing
to accept Japanese public opinion as
being what it is, it would seem natural
that visits of nuclear warships should
be kept to a minute minimum or
abandoned altogether. Their continua-
tion only helps <the case of those sus-
pecting a Tokyo-Washington intent to
rid the Japanese of their “nuclear
allergy.” Similarly, while further
nuclear submarine visits and all but
the most necessary of night flights from
U.S. air bases have both been sus-
pended, the political damage has
already been done.
In the case of the radiation levels
at Sasebo, the inability of the Japanese
and American scientists to agree upon
whether or not the submarine caused
them through discharges while in port
has scarcely helped matters.
Meanwhile, Mr. Sato’s electoral
tacking his ability to win an extra
two-year term as Prime Minister later
this year hinges on the results is not
only caused by these and other inci-
dents in Japan itself but also by the
fact that developments have called into
question his basically pro-American
stance. (Other likely contenders for the
Premiership would possibly 'be more
neutral in their orientation, especially
in regard to Sino-Japanese relations.)
Tokyo students protesting over Vietnam
Notably the American decision to
negotiate over Vietnam was greeted
by deafening public silence in Japanese
ruling circles, though, in private, com-
ments were plentifully available ques-
tioning Sato’s judgment much is
forgiven in Japanese politics provided
you look like and appear to be backed
by a winner.
Beneath and beyond immediate per-
sonal political considerations, the
future course of U.S.-Japanese relations
will largely be determined by three
issues trade, Okinawa, and the
future of the Japanese-American
security treaty when it comes up for
revision in 1970.
All three are complex subjects in
themselves, with the last two particu-
larly being linked into what could be
an explosive combination. On trade,
Part of a U.S. Phantom jet which
crashed on Kyushu University on June 2
A U.S. nuclear sub ties up near Tokyo
the Japanese have substantial reasons
for fearing any protectionist drift in
American economic policies, while
America, like other Western countries,
feels that, when it comes to the subject
of economic protectionism, the Jap-
anese are scarcely in a position to lec-
ture anyone. The pressure for the
return of Okinawa, another irredentist
issue over which the Liberal Demo-
cratic Government had to trim its sails,
has scarcely diminished with the return
of the Bonin Islands to Japan recently.
For both Americans and Japanese
the issue of Okinawa’s return is linked
not only with the Vietnam outcome but
also with the future of American bases,
nuclear and non-nuclear, and therefore
with the defence treaty. And in a
nutshell, since the negotiation of the
treaty in 1960 produced the greatest


crisis in Japanese-American relations
so far (as well as the fall of Mr. Sato’s
brother Kishi from the Premiership),
it is not surprising that 1970 is like-
wise regarded with some trepidation.
All in all, then, current storms be-
tween these two major Pacific Powers
are very much linked with future
tempests. A recent American report
sponsored by the Centre For Strategic
Studies maintained that “a mistaken
preoccupation with mainland China”
is the main cause of the U.S. being
“poorly prepared for the impending
crises in Japanese-U.S. relations.”
Recent events plus the even greater
preoccupation with Vietnam have
made the preparation even poorer.
The Presidency
Humphrey's burden
THE BONHOMIE is as engulfing as
ever, the step is still bouncy, the voice
remains buoyant. “Ladies and gentle-
men, the Vice-President of the United
States” and even among his own
Vice-President Humphrey...will the “cheerful chappie” become a sad fellow?
people and on his own ground Hubert
Humphrey is just the same “cheerful
chappie” that the nation has always
known. Yet there is no doubt that the
Humphrey campaign is in serious
trouble.
If Humphrey needs now to be scared
of one thing above anything else, it is
the growing public impression that, far
from being his Party’s free choice for
the nomination, he is the candidate that
a none-too-sensitive machine hierarchy
is determined to foist on a reluctant
electorate.
Ironically, the better Humphrey does
in terms of picking up non-elected dele-
gates, the more that charge will stick.
It may well have needed some such
catalyst as the astonishing McCarthy
triumph in New York last week to give
all the criticism and suspicion a cutting-
edge: but it has certainly now made its
popular impact.
Unfair though it may be, Hubert
Humphrey has suddenly come to look
like the very symbol and epitome of
precisely the old-line backstairs politics
that throughout the Primaries the
voters have seemed determined to
reject.
If it were his decision alone,
Humphrey would probably be prepared
to brazen the whole thing out as he
has been doing by laying claim to a
totally disproportionate number of the
State’s convention delegates. But a
Presidential candidate who chooses to
try to make his way to the nomination
by relying solely on the power of local
machines is in the last resort dependent
on the power brokers who control them.
For the most part, however, the
bosses who control State delegations
will want to watch and bide their
time. Their interest basically is always
in a potential winner, and if by August
it has become clear that Humphrey is
not one and that McCarthy is, the
Vice-President’s position (strong as it
now looks) will be no more defensible
than was that of the unfortunate Sen-
ator Taft in face of the Eisenhower
challenge of 1952.
Already Senator McCarthy, who now
seems to believe almost implicitly in
his own convention victory, has begun
to model his strategy on that precedent.
A new theme has been added to his
campaign, a stern and uncompromising
demand that this year’s Democratic .
convention shall be an “open” one,
responsive 'to personal decisions and
individual judgments unfettered by the
shackles of Party discipline.
“I am not here,” he said rather
grandly last week when he preceded
Humphrey in addressing a delegates’
dinner, “to try to gather five or six
delegates. I’m not even asking people
to make a commitment to me. I’ve
said from the beginning that the im-
portant thing is that we have a con-
vention in which everyone is free to
make his own best judgment.”
In essence it is, of course, very much
the same tactic that Nelson Rockefeller
'has been trying to employ on the
Republican side: and it is puzzling that
a technique which could yet prove suc-
cessful against Humphrey should so
clearly have failed against Nixon.
There are, admittedly, obvious points
of difference one of which could be
that McCarthy has consistently
eschewed the shrill tone and strident
language that Rockefeller seems more
and more driven back upon.
But there is a significant difference,
too, between their respective opponents.
Nixon, after all, did take the Primary
route and piled up along the way im-
pressive manifestations of popular
support. He is not, therefore, vulnerable
in the same way to charges of trying to
get the nomination through the back
door. Nor does the Republican Party
face the same need to rejuvenate itself
and refurbish its appeal that the Demo-
crats necessarily confront after eight
years continuously in office.
And that is the other substantial and
increasing liability that Humphrey
carries with him into this year’s Presi-
dential race. No one especially after
all his reiterated assertions last week
that from now on he intends to be “his
own man” can accuse Humphrey of
not having tried to escape from the
dead-weight of the present Administia-
tion’s record.
But the trouble here is that the more
the Vice-President tries to break new
ground whether in hints about a
possible recognition of Communist
China or his own unrepentant return
to calling for a Marshall Plan for
America’s cities the more inevitably
he draws attention to the one area in
which he boxed himself in: Vietnam.
If, as it has suddenly become fashion-
able to proclaim, that was the one
dominant issue of the Primaries from
New Hampshire to New York, then the
“cheerful chappie” could well before
August begin to look like rather a sad
fellow.
U.S. foreign aid
In for the kill
SUPPORT IN THE U.S. for foreign
aid has been ebbing year by year, and
now it seems that the well is almost
dry. Cases of inefficient management
have come to light; many of the former
supporters of foreign aid have become
disillusioned with the effects of involve-
ments abroad; and its enemies are
closing in for the kill. Though the
balance of international payments is
largely insulated from the impact of
aid, the big deficit on foreign trans-
actions makes a good excuse for cutting
back.
There is speculation in Washington
that Congress may even adjourn for the


election campaign without having
passed a Foreign Aid Bill at all, on
the ground that there is enough money
in the pipeline to keep the program
going for a year. But with Government
spending scheduled to be reduced by $6
billion, not even optimists can imagine
that foreign aid will escape the deepest
cuts in its history.
In the House of Representatives the
Foreign Affairs Committee has taken
almost $6OO million from the Presi-
dent’s request, already the smallest ever,
for $2.9 billion and the Republicans say
that they will fight on the floor for an
additional cut of $4OO million.
Perhaps even more discouraging is
that the mood is spreading to contribu-
tions to multilateral development
agencies. Until recently this type of aid
enjoyed growing support because it
was conditional on other advanced
countries sharing the burden and be-
cause international agencies could keep
the recipients up to the mark without
involving the United States in nasty
squabbles and charges of neo-
colonialism. It is true that Congress
has passed and the President has signed
an undertaking to provide a new sub-
scription of $412 million, probably in
two instalments, to the capital of the
Inter-American Development Bank. But
recently the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee turned thumbs down on an
additional $2OO million for the Asian
Development Bank. And, sharing the
hesitations of the Banking Committee
of the House of Representatives, it
postponed a decision on the American
contribution to replenish the funds of
the International Development Associ-
ation. This is the World Bank’s sub-
sidiary which provides long-term loans
at no interest for the very poorest of the
developing countries. If Congress is
approached properly, IDA may yet get
its money.
But congressional time is growing
short and IDA’s pockets are almost
empty. Moreover, until the United
States acts, there can be no call on the
contributions of other members of the
association; the American share is
about 40 percent of the total. In the
past about three-quarters of IDA’s
loans have gone to India and Pakistan.
Malaysia
Reds on the hook
NO SOONER was the Five-Power
Conference over than Peking Radio was
describing it as plotting “a criminal
scheme for joint suppression of the
people’s national liberation struggle in
South-East Asia after the British with-
drawal.” Inadvertently underlining the
British argument that potential aggres-
sors look more at military capacity than
commitments, Peking attacked the pro-
posed joint military exercises and the
retention of Malaysia’s jungle warfare
school as evidence of “anti-Communist
anti-people counter-revolutionary mili-
tary collusion” for “joint suppression
of the people’s national liberation
struggle.” Obviously the Chinese had
not heard what the Anglo-Anzacs said
in the conference about not taking part
in internal security operations.
While this report held British im-
perialism to be decadent but still potent
a Malayan Communist Party state-
ment, also broadcast by Peking on the
twentieth anniversary of the “anti-
British war of liberation” meaning
the Emergency—considered the British
suppressors “on their last legs” and
saw the infiltration of U.S. imperialism
and its satellites together with the
Soviet revisionist renegade group as
the new supporters of the “Rahman-
Lee Kuan Yew puppet cliques.” The
MCP statement saw currency devalu-
ation, the declining price of rubber,
rising prices and exorbitant taxes, in-
creased unemployment and lessening
schooling opportunities as indicating
“a rising tide of struggle” which would
make inevitable “the outbreak of a
new revolutionary storm.”
Needless to say the MCP saw that
“Socialist China has become the centre
A model of a typical Communist guerilla hideout on the Malaysia-Thai border from
which terrorists emerged last week to kill 15 Malaysian policemen
and base of world revolution,” and the
Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee naturally reciprocated by
issuing a sister anniversary statement of
greetings and support for MCP smash-
ing of Malaysia in order to “overthrow
the reactionary rule of British imperial-
ism and its lackeys, and win genuine
independence, unification, and democ-
racy for Malaysia.”
The “anniversary” week was not
lacking in demonstrations by the Com-
munists who in Tun Razak’s words
—“want to renew their armed struggle.”
On Sunday 120 alleged sympathisers
were detained in a police raid on a
lonely pineapple estate in Johore,
where they were having an indoctrina-
tion picnic the largest such raid for
quite a while. On Monday evening
. there was the largest incident to occur
since the Emergency ended eight years
ago, resulting in the death of 15
Malaysian police, the wounding of 18
others, and only two escaping un-
injured. This occurred on the Thai-
Malaysian border in the Betong Salient
where Chin Peng’s MCP guerilla
remnants, numbering 500 to 600, are
located. Evidently moving in anticipa-
tion of an ambush expected elsewhere,
the field force patrol were caught be-
tween an embankment and a ravine.
Follow-up operations have yielded no
contacts nor MCP casualties, though
there are vague reports of the Thais
arresting five Communists in Betong.
On Wednesday Malaysian firemen
in Penang, Johore Bahru, and Kuala
Lumpur had to haul down Communist
flags stealthily placed on top of build-
ings under cover of night, while Com-
munist pamphlets were also discovered
by police in various areas.
Well, of course, Mao sayings at
student picnics are not exactly un-
common in many parts of the world,
Thai-Malaysian co-operation has always
been more verbal than actual, and,
unlike those in Cholon, the fluttering
flags are not precursors to a Tet offen-
sive. Against this, these incidents indi-
cate there are no grounds for com-
placency, still less for carelessness and
inefficiency. The last such ambush was
two years ago (ten casualties) and it
may well be as long before there is
another. Still the police lose face and
the MCP gains morale boost. The
Communist anniversary statements do
not indicate any fresh line except that
mention of the schools indicates the
MCP still knows a delicate communal
issue when it sees one. But, essentially
after 20 years, the MCP is still on the
same hook of being demonstrably a
Chinese party as far or as near
removed from making a comeback as
Indonesia’s PKI is from staging a
revival.


Our neighborhood
Barking over Sabah
From HARVEY STOOKWIN
in Kuala Lumpur
THE SIMILARITY between the Paris
talks over Vietnam and the Bangkok
talks over the Sabah claim was empha-
sised this week as the Malaysians and
Filipinos got bogged down in pro-
cedural wrangles seemingly indicative
of a desire for propaganda. First, the
Filipinos wanted all the proceedings
tape-recorded. The Malaysians declined,
Mr. Hasluck with Philippines President Marcos last week...“If you have a
good sheepdog you don’t go around barking”
well aware of the likely playback to
the Manila Press. The Filipinos next
requested all questions on their claim
to be made in writing, which made the
Malaysians feel the negotiations could
as well have been conducted by post.
As the talks go into the second week,
it would appear that the Filipinos want
discussion limited to recourse to the
World Court, while the Malaysians, like
the Americans in Paris, want discussions
to include the wider issues. But, so far,
the only recorded progress is that both
sides are still talking.
So was Mr. Hasluck when he arrived
in Manila on Thursday, giving a firm
expression of Australian neutrality
“We are on friendly relations with the
Philippines and Malaysia, and we will
continue to have friendly relations with
both. We certainly will not take sides
or express public views on this matter,”
he was widely reported as saying in
relation to the claim.
Leaving aside whether such a state-
ment is, in present circumstances, either
desirable, practical, or even meaningful,
on the Paris peace talks, Mr. Hasluck
felt the present deadlock was best left
to the principal parties “There is a
saying in Australia that if you have a
good sheepdog you don’t go around
barking.” While one assumes Mr.
Hasluck will express private views to
the Filipinos on where their Sabah
barking is taking the regional flock, the
fact is that his neutrality statement was
a form of barking itself, not likely
any more than the Sabah claim itself—
to keep both Australian continuums of
friendly relations from being upset. But,
then, maybe Canberra’s fixed-mind
China-watchers cannot see the simil-
arity between Hanoi in Paris and
Manila in Bangkok ... or was it that
Australia was once more automatically
following the American sheepdog? .
New Zealand
Arbitration crisis
THE WINTER of industrial unrest
started in New Zealand with an Arbi-
tration Court decision last week which
was not only economically questionable
but also sufficiently explosive to open
the way for a far-reaching shake-up in
political and industrial relations. The
Arbitration Court, faced with a Feder-
ation of Labor claim for a general
wage increase, refused >to grant a penny
in the first nil decision for 27 years.
The immediate reaction of a Govern-
ment taken by surprise was to increase
social security benefits and take the
unprecedented step for a so-called “free
enterprise” administration of imposing
a near universal price freeze. The
Federation of Labor condemned the
court’s decision and took another un-
precedented step by convening a
special conference for July 4. The
Wellington Trades Council called for
a return to direct bargaining as the
only alternative to the Court, and
Wellington Trades Council President
Toby Hill declared that the Arbitra-
tion Court had sounded its death knell.
Dissatisfaction with the Court’s
decision was inevitable when it chose
a new weighting to the six criteria
which govern it. Judge Blair con-
ceded a case on the basis of an in-
crease in the cost of living, but declined
an order on general economic grounds.
Labor Leader Kirk said the Court had
gone too far in attempting what was
essentially a political decision in fixing
wage levels on the grounds of national
economic interest.
The Court has no economic advisory
services 'to assist it make complex
economic decisions. The rub came when
the Court’s economic wisdom was ques-
tioned by Monetary and Economic
Council Chairman Dr. Battersby, who
said the economy could have stood at
least a small wage increase. As other
economists chimed the same chorus,
manufacturers began taking unilateral
decisions in obvious disagreement with
the Court’s decision and as a precaution
against industrial action. United
Empire Box, which has been recently
successful in expanding the sale of
packaging goods to Australia,
announced a bonus for all their
employees. By the end of the weekend
two other firms had followed suit, and
the manufacturers’ organisations began
publicly calling on its members to
desist and act only after consultations
with each other.
The unions are attempting a show of
strength this week at the opening of
Parliament. They plan a protest march
and general stoppage all day in Wel-
lington. Students, public servants, and
unions not affiliated to the Federation
of Labor have pledged support.
The price freeze, which is virtually
meaningless in a sluggish economy and
which does not compensate for price
increases since the 1966 wage order,
took the heat off the Government, but
it is probably still insufficient to pre-
vent an increase in Labor and union
unity.
Apart from direct action the unions,
which could themselves benefit from
structural reforms, have not worked out
their long-term answers to the new
situation. The Federation of Labor
stands to benefit from keeping itself as
the unions’ representative in negotia-
tions with other groups a pre-
eminence it will lose with direct action.
Industrial-relations specialist F. L. J.
Young, of Victoria University, has been
suggesting to a few receptive unionists
Swedish-style joint planning for man-
power needs by Government, union,
and employer representatives. The
climate of change could bring such
new ideas to the fore if the Federation
of Labor thinks rather than beats its
way through the unrest.


Women with time
on their hands
A succession of pots ...a succession of hobbies
By APRIL HERSEY
FOR AUSTRALIA’S population of 12
million it probably requires at least five
million alarm clocks to blast the day to
life. Like disturbed beehives the houses
of Grand Suburbia come to life for
the mad two hours when workers
shower, shave, dress, eat breakfast, and
run, and the children eat, dress, lose
vital things they need for school, and
finally are dispatched. The clocks don’t
lose their steady beating, but from the
moment the gate slams for the last time
on the morning rush the long streets of
comfortable houses become empty
dormitories where the woman of the
house moves about preparing the rooms
for the re-entry of those who will come
banging back in the late afternoon.
There is all time and no time for
those who are left behind.
Women, the wasted millions, churn
about in their domestic sagas, sometimes
loving the comfort and security,
enjoying their young children and the
luxury of knitting by the fire in the
early afternoon when office workers arc
still chained to their desks, and some-
times angry and bitter at the joke
played on them by their instinct for
procreation.
Their restlessness forces them to make
continual darts into the livelier world.
The footpaths of the suburbs are like
a tightrope on one side the houses
filled with the comforts of a hire-
purchase world, on the other a veritable
abyss of substitutes.
There are the morning and afternoon
coffee clubs, only some of which have
a purpose (selling plastics, raising funds,
even discussing washing powders); the
weekly tennis dates; the ladies’ day at
bowls or ten-pin bowling (the latter
attracts 40,000 women in New South
Wales); the playing of golf with one’s
crowd, followed by a day of desultory
drinking at the club; or getting out to
the gala day at a suburban market
place; the endless luncheons for charity
with their attendant hairdos and cloth-
ing requirements; and the long, wasted,
boring hours of minor committee meet-
ings for everything from raising funds
for a kindergarten to raising a squall of
protest against any point on which some
member of the community differs from
the local council.
What’s it all about? What am I
doing here? These are the eternal
unanswerable questions of suburbia. The
inner searching after truth is more the
preserve of the housewife in Australia
today than it is the agony of the teen-
ager or the hippies. Once the reality
of boredom sets in, the housewife moves
from interest to interest, like someone
moving from window to window in an
empty house. This week it’s a lecture,
next week cake decorating, a part-time
job doing door-to-door surveys, a day
at the school canteen.
Just about everyone is waiting for
her to venture down the garden path.
There are model schools offering charm
courses; there are special courses of
facials, including skin peeling, to be
had at beauty salons. She can have a
whole change of personality with a
new hairstyle, bright new colors. She
can sign on for years to slim herself
down to a new silhouette or take on
dancing lessons in the same pentathlon
style. Women from Burwood and Fitz-


roy are to be found in the arms of
instructors in dance studios reverberat-
ing with Latin-American tempos at any
time of the day. She may feel more
serious about The Dance and sign up
for interpretative dancing, jazz ballet,
classical ballet, or even highland flings.
Cavorting about in leotards is almost
certain to be one of the stages of escape
from domestic boredom. Usually before
long the physical exhaustion brought
on by this enthusiasm causes regression
to the cave and the mid-morning bread
and Vegemite. The leotards are
borrowed by teenage daughters as tights,
and mother’s dream of looking like a
Girl from U.N.C.L.E. fades.
Yoga is the one leotard-orientated
diversion which seems to persist long
after the rigorous bicycle-pedalling
routines have been abandoned. Com-
bining hard physical effort with mental
discipline, yoga, if carried to the
ultimate degree, will, it is claimed,
give the practitioner samadhi a
feeling of oneness with the universe.
But it isn’t really harmony of the mind
and body that the desperate home-
makers seek when they begin yoga.
Most of them have heard that it “makes
you look ten years younger,” and they
are prepared to stand on their heads if
there is even a chance of a rebate on
age.
However, once they have begun the
long, slow approach to perfection some
of the serenity of the Eastern
philosophers seems to descend upon
them.
“I keep coming,” one housewife said,
searching for words. “I can’t quite tell
what it’s doing to me, but I feel better,
I feel as though there are hidden
benefits I’m not sort of aware of. I
can’t do all the movements, but I
try. I’m sleeping better. I come to the
meditation classes, too, though I find it
hard to concentrate. And, of course, the
Swami is marvellous.”
The Swami Sarasvati is marvellous.
Reputed to be 38, she looks a slim 16
in her orange leotard, radiates serenity,
except for an inclination to bite her
lips and twist her fingers while trying to
cope with materialistic Cremorne.
The Swami arrived in Australia about
two years ago in an effort to bind
Western and Eastern thought, and with
premises promised to her in Cremorne.
But the philanthropist who had visited
the Swami’s family ashram in Benares
had died before he could arrange to
give the Swami his property. His family,
though friendly, were not so inclined.
“We cannot ask for anything,” the
Swami said sadly. “It must be given.
So I have decided to build my own
ashram here a community house
where any people can come to meditate
and rest.”
In India a Swami would be fed,
housed, and showered with fruit and
flowers. They take a vow not to handle
money. But in Australia, Swami Saras-
vati decided she would have to re-
arrange her thoughts to fit into the
western world.
“Everyone seemed to want to learn
yoga,” she said. “So I began to teach.
In India I would not charge people
but here I have to pay rent and
hoard for the ashram.”
The classes are only about 20 cents
each, and less if the student becomes
enthusiastic and attends more each
week, so the Swami is hardly exploiting
the affluent. She does not charge for
her meditation classes.
Born in northern India into a
Brahmin family, she arrived with a
crescent-moon birthmark on her fore-
head which destined her for a more
than normally spiritual life. Beginning
yoga at the age of three, she made her
first pilgrimage alone to the Himalayas
at the age of 11. She was taught from
the beginning of her life to form no
attachments, and was regarded by her
father, a guru or teacher, as his disciple
and not his daughter. She did not call
him father nor feel any more kinship
with sisters and brothers than for any
other pupils who shared her classes.
“Astral travelling,” the ability to have
her mind leave her body, was quite an
early experience for the Swami. Even
as a child she could, she says, reach the
most advanced stages of meditation.
The women who flock to her bell-
hung retreat behind the Orpheum
Theatre at Cremorne are not so for-
tunate. To the Swami they seem over-
come with worries. She herself has
married since arriving in Australia, a
step which she feels was necessary so
that she could understand the problems
of her pupils and which will not stand
in the way of her eventual retirement
as a hermit to the Himalayas. Her
husband is a photographer who is also
working for the establishment of the
ashram.
“No one really needs help in them-
selves,” the Swami said earnestly,
surveying her class of anxious women.
“They torture themselves worrying
about problems they cannot solve. They
rush from one hustle-bustle to the next.
The more tense they get, the more
wrinkles. They are so obsessed with
owning things, and then they become
dominated by what they own.”
The Swami herself appears to own
a string of wooden beads, a charming
Siamese cat called Sahdu, her orange
leotards, and an equally orange sari.
Perhaps she has other possessions, but
the message in her advertising (“bring
fruit and flowers”) seems to be her
means of sustenance. She fasts two days
a week, eats only fruit and vegetables
otherwise. She meditates for all but a
few hours of the night and is up at
3 a.m. for a swim at Balmoral beach
with her cat and, presumably, any dawn
fishermen who must by now be getting-
used to finding a Swami meditating on
the beach.
Her classes are a cross-section: a boy
of two and a half curing his knock-
knees, the asthmatic and others
genuinely ill, and the dozens of bored
and aging women reaching out for her
mystic promises.
“Six weeks ago I had a lady of 89
come to me,” she said. “She was very
sick and lonely, newly widowed, and
worrying about her excess weight, which
was contributing to her ill health. She
did not believe she could do anything
here, but, of course, she could. Every-
one can study yoga. Two days ago I
gave her a special mantra, her sound
for meditation, and now instead of
being lonely at home she sits and medi-
tates. She used to go to the pub, but
now she is learning to be at peace and
she stays at home.”
Even without the mantra, this 89-
year-old pub-crawler sounds pretty
impressive.
“So many women think they cannot
learn yoga, but this is so wrong. The
control of the body is only part of it.
It isn’t a religion it brings us all
closer to our particular god. It teaches
us to live and to relieve the tensions.
Anything can be achieved with yoga
to help the body from the toes to
the hair. There was one man with grey
hair that I knew. He was 60 years of
age, but he was determined to prove
that his hair would turn black again,
so for three years he stood on his head
for three hours a day and gradually
it turned back to black again.”
The Swami is loaded with this kind
of cheerful information and is prepared
to give her notable vitality more and
more to teaching and perhaps in
calming the storms of the ladies and,
for that matter, the gentlemen of Aus-
tralia. She hopes eventually to reach
millions through television, a medium
in which she would certainly be highly
decorative.
Another link with the calm heights
of Eastern thought is the art of Ikebana,
the Japanese science of flower arranging.


Pioneered by Norman Sparnon, an
Australian Army major stationed in
Japan as a linguist and later attached
to General MacArthur’s headquarters in
a civilian capacity, it now has thousands
of devotees in Australia. Settled in
suburban Tokyo with his American
wife in the immediate post-war years,
Sparnon acted as interpreter for her
when, probably in the same dilemma
as the Australian woman today, she
had a Japanese teacher come to the
house to instruct her in Ikebana. Her
husband found it easier to show her
what the teacher was explaining.
Then he became interested himself.
Now, 20 years later, he holds the
highest qualifications of any westerner
outside Japan. His book on Ikebana,
published nine years ago, is still a best-
seller, a very expensive best-seller,
recently cited by the “New Yorker”
Ikebana expert Mr. Norman Sparnon at
work with a pupil
magazine as the most authoritative work
yet published in English. Sparnon has
obtained all the diplomas he can from
the Sorgetsu, or modern school, and is
a senior professor fourth grade in the
classical Ikenobo school, having gone
higher up the academic ladder in this
incredibly perfectionist school than any
western enthusiast before him. One
lifetime he feels would not be long
enough to get to the top in Ikenobo.
Known to hundreds of pupils at a
time as Master irt the traditional
Japanese manner, Sparnon has his
temple in a quiet street in Darling
Point. Beyond the frangipani in the
garden is a two-storey house, a veranda
scattered with the twisted limbs of drift-
wood waiting to be used in arrange-
ments, and, within, the fresh scent of
flowers and leaves permeating the whole
Victorian-cum-Japanese house.
The studio, with its rows of laminated
desks, floor of striped vinyl tiles, and
dais, is obviously a mecca for the dedi-
cated women who give much more than
fleeting time to this absorbing art. It
isn’t expensive to learn ten lessons
cost about $25, with bowls and other
equipment supplied.
“It is an extremely beautiful, reward-
ing, engaging study, infinite in its con-
cept.” Its mentor is himself completely
captivated. “I can never retire from it.
And I’ll never master it. Most men feel
that eventually they’ll retire and have
a few years of easy living. The Ikebana
teacher feels otherwise. I think half
my life is gone and I’ll never reach the
understanding with nature that I want.”
He draws his pupils from the middle-
aged women with grown families who
long for some involvement. Younger
women who are interested often find
the sacrifices required in long hours of
dedication too hard to mix with
growing children.
“It is generally a woman whose home
is quite completed, children at school
or grown up, no real financial problems,
and that feeling that it’s her turn to do
something,” Sparnon said. “Perhaps a
love of flowers is at the root of desire
to learn Ikebana. My pupils all seem
to have a very nice outlook on life,
they are extremely pleasant. No one
remains in a class long if their interest,
is only in pursuing a fashion. The art
itself is too demanding.”
Many of his students are from the
country and will come to Sydney for
weeks on end to spend their days at
the studio.
Unlike the great masters in Japan,
who have such an enormous following
that they are among the highest-paid
artists in their country and come in the
range of the top 40 industrialists as far
as income is concerned, Australia’s
master teacher is not concerned with
wealth.
Bringing the message of Ikebana to
the beauty-hungry women of Australia
is, he says, a hard, time-consuming job.
Sparnon commutes between Sydney,
Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, and
Brisbane, with detours to Murwillum-
bah, Lismore, Junee, Millicent, and
many other places in between, in a far
from serene non-stop driving marathon
which leaves him little time for the
exhibitions and books he is constantly
being asked to produce. But he has
produced 150 Australian teachers since
he began, and now these in turn in
many cases are giving classes.
“The interest keeps growing. Aus-
tralian women have a great flair for the
work. And it’s something that perman-
ently enriches their lives. Something
they can take back into their homes.
Women do so much, try so hard. I
know that Ikebana is leading to a new
concept of pottery in Australia. I am
encouraging local potters to produce
the kind of pots that the work requires.
The Japanese do it so effortlessly and
well —.but sometimes I get the
nervous feeling that half the women in
Australia are mixing up clay in their
kitchens and turning out the most
ghastly dough creations, like something
for their kitchen ovens.”
True. The urge to pot is something
akin to the urge to make bread, and
clay creeps into many suburban lives.
Bill Huff-Johnston, of the Potters’
Society of Australia, takes endless day-
time classes for what one of his assist-
ants calls “mainly the North Shore
ladies —about as old as my mother”—
at the Woolloomooloo Pot Shop.
He feels they are extremely dedicated
and he gives them more than the usual
lump-of-clay-and-they’re-off technique
which applies to many evening classes
around the high schools. They study the
techniques seriously and receive lectures
as well as having practical work.
“Most of these women already own
a kiln and a wheel. Many of them sell
their work and even have exhibitions.
We concentrate on good sturdy pots
the kind of things they can use in their
homes.”
Women can learn to pot at the East
Sydney Technical College. They can
take a 12-week course in painting
and sculpture, drawing, dress designings
interior designing, even industrial de-
signing. In the School of Fashion they
can learn millinery, dressmaking, floral
art, soft furnishing, and how to use a
power machine. The Home Science
field offers short courses in cake decor-
ating, savory making, biscuit baking,
buffet meals, entrees, and desserts,, a
hostess course, entertaining for special
occasions, and, if things are really
desperate, the housewife can take a
crash course in bar service which quali-
fies her as a barmaid.
Although these classes are usually
packed to the doors, many women are
inclined to take their search for fulfil-
ment more seriously than the 12-week
course allows.
There are always 30 or 40 cars
parked outside the Willoughby Work-
shop at Chatswood, where each week
500 people, including more than 100
children and teenagers, come hurrying
across the threshold into the stimulating
atmosphere of an arts complex. Here
they can learn painting, sculpture,
mosaics, lithography, woodcuts, how to
make jewellery, speech, eurythmics,
acting, and many other things.
Growing out of a studio started by
Joy Ewart in 1961, the workshop is a
co-operative of teachers who enrol their
own students and give 25 percent of
the fees back to keep the umbrella of
the studio over their heads.
Membership of 'the workshop is $4 a
year, or $6 a year for families, only $1
a year for those under 21. Individual
classes vary, but a course of 13 weeks
of painting in four-hourly classes costs
about $22. The women bring their
lunches and work hard on a variety of
projects.

doesn’t expect his pupils to have talent.
“Most students are housewives, and they
don’t intend to become serious painters.
But they are deadly serious about the
work they are doing. Often there isn’t
much promise, but there are no dilet-
tantes. Their work develops within the
disciplines of art as best it can. It isn’t
a hobby centre. These women get very
depressed with their effort sometimes.
They have a great urge to work hard.”
There are monthly functions to spur
them on, with guest speakers like Daniel
Thomas, Douglas Annand, and Tom
Bass. For 75 cents they can go out in
sketching groups and work together.
No one begins with the rudiments of
drawing. They just start where it seems
their expression will lead them, and
their instructors guide them.
There are 22 teachers instructing in
art. There are four well-known potters
with overflow classes, and literally no
time slots left for any more classes,
night or day. There are no diplomas,
only a chance to spend from four to
eight hours a week under expert guid-
ance trying to find self-expression.
“The work is often very interesting.
We try to instil what is and what is not
art into them and often they achieve
quite remarkable work without knowing
it.”
It doesn’t surprise Mr. Sharp that
so many women crowd his classrooms.
“The desire to do something like this
is latent in everybody. It just takes the
courage to come through the door. We
are working at capacity and we simply
cannot expand any more. Our pupils
stay for years. It takes a long time for
a glimmer that something is happening
to show through.”
For many women that courage to
come through the door never comes,
and they are the secret doers who send
in coupons for self-improvement.
Catering for this great untapped
reservoir are many small correspon-
dence schools which offer everything
from memory training to art and
I'kebana in ten easy lessons. Much more
sophisticated is the newly established
Famous Schools Pty. Ltd., with head-
quarters in the United States.
A sales complex worth nearly $5O
million, established in Europe and
Japan as well, the name of the Famous
Schools was heard in Australia only
last Christmas. They offer many courses,
including fine arts, commercial art,
writing, and photography. Relatively
few advertisements have been placed
so far in Australian publications and
from them have come a frantic 20,000
coupons. The coupons elicit a brochure
giving general information, costs, and
an aptitude test. The test is sent on to
the United States for grading and if
this is satisfactory (about 20 percent
are rejected) then a student counsellor
calls on the Famous protegee and signs
her at $2O down to a $450 course
financed over three years. If she has
chosen art, then all her equipment and
art books will be given to her for the
full course. The same applies to other
courses as far as textbooks are con-
cerned. Writers are not supplied with
typewriters, nor photographers with
cameras.
So far 300 women are industriously
working away in the privacy of their
homes and the demand has been so
solid that the schools plan to become
national after a trial period in New
South Wales only.
The home-study courses are all
marked in the United States and the
student can expect her painting returned
with corrected overlays and a series of
notes covering several pages on each
attempt. The beauty of this system is
that she can find her own time, but
the drawbacks are again the loneliness
of the long-distance runner in her own
backyard. How many of these expensive
kits will be in the garage in two years’
time?
The only classroom likely to take
shape in the Famous Schools repertoire
will be one for speed reading. This
should have many takers, since higher
education with its great load of reading
is in the minds of so many Australian
women today.
The evening colleges are busier than
ever, with a steadily increasing work
load on the teachers of interesting sub-
jects. Of course, the devoted suburban
potters dash out of their homes all day
checking that the fires are right in kilns
for the evening.
The Workers’ Educational Associa-
tion classes attract far more women than
workers. In the metropolitan Sydney
area there are 5893 women in a total of
8387. According to Mr. P. J. Tyler,
metropolitan secretary, this would be
the proportion throughout the classes.
Everything from Chinese language
classes to philosophy, psychology, and
political science can be taken through
the auspices of the WEA.
And over at Macquarie University
the mums are still holding their own.
Despite the rush of post-Wyndham
youngsters, the pregnant young
mothers still flock to work in the library
between classes and park their pre-
schoolers at the nursery. There is a
waiting list for nursery admission and
extra staff is presently being acquired.
Just how many mums are at Macquarie
is hard to define, and to the teaching
faculty it doesn’t mean much. The brain
is considered the important thing the
packaging doesn’t matter.
Whether any of it matters much is
the fear that haunts the busy, busy
ladies as they throw away the time on
their hands. Is a degree worth having
if there is no real purpose in acquiring
it? Is a job worth doing if it is “only
for your own good” and not something
you really want to do? Is there any

The high art of anti-devebpment
By PETER SAMUEL
AT THE beginning of this year, when
he emerged as a Prime Ministerial
candidate, Mr. Gorton told us that his
heart was in national development and
social welfare. But events have forced
him to spend almost all his time since
then in looking at defence and foreign
policies, matters which he has made
perfectly clear he regards as a diversion
from the gutsy and traditional themes
of Australian leadership.
Now that his Asian and American
visiting is over and further defence and
foreign policy decisions are postponed
until late in the year, he will have time
to get down to his favored areas of
policymaking. With financial disburse-
ments to the State Governments and the
Commonwealth Budget the next major
items on the Cabinet agenda, he will
be making decisions on development
and welfare for the first time.
It can be assumed, I think, that so
far as welfare goes he will rely very
heavily on his Ministers. Those he has
most personal confidence in, Mr. Went-
worth and Mr. Fraser, are on that side.
In any case, Government welfare spend-
ing is largely a matter of deciding
politically how much you can soak
income earners by taxation so that you
can give the money to those who could
do with it.
It is on the development side that
Mr. Gorton will face his most testing
problems. For development policy is
laced with obstacles arising from the
differing interests of the coalition, and
the sharing of responsibility with State
Governments. But perhaps the most
fundamental difficulty is a widespread
popular confusion as to what develop-
ment is supposed to be about.
Mr. Gorton may find he has to try
to inject an element of education into
some of his Government’s pronounce-
ments on the subject. He may need to
start a sort of dialogue with voters and
politicians on what development con-
sists of. Ask the ordinary voter what he
means by “development” and he will
most probably reply: Development is
the building of things like railway
lines, factories, dams, power stations,
houses, and roads. It is clearing land
for farming. It is making airports and
putting up new schools and univer-
sities.
If he knew the simple jargon he
would say: Development is investment.
It is investing resources and effort
today to give a yield of goods or ser-
vices tomorrow.
But if this is all we mean by the
word development; then there is a
myth to be demolished and a confusion
to be cleared away.
To clear away this confusion, the
dialogue with the voter should then
ask the silly question: What about
building a dam in the desert? What
about that? Is that sort of thing de-
velopment? Is that what you want?
To which the voter will reply: No,
of course w T e don’t want that.
To which the Government Leader
should say: Well, if you want develop-
ment then you do not simply want
things built. You do not simply want
investment. You want it to yield a
return which justifies its cost. You want_
it to earn for the community a profit
in the sense that its returns will be
worth more to the community than the
effort and resources put into it.
The first myth about development
has been cleared away. It is not just a
matter of building structures and in-
vesting resources, and it is not a policy
of development simply trying to maxi-
mise the amount of investment. It in-
volves estimates of profitability.
Another popular answer to the
question What do you mean by devel-
opment? might be: Development is
utilising resources which now lie unused.
Images are evoked of oil deep in the
ground, forests of timber unchopped,
water running into the sea, minerals
lying undug, and pastures remaining
uneaten. Development is pictured as a
striving for complete resource utilisation.
It is a process by which we try to
utilise every usable raw material or
power source we have.
This shows another myth about devel-
opment to be cleared away by dialogue.
The answer can proceed along these
lines: Fortunately we are blessed with
innumerable usable resources of various
kinds, and we keep on discovering more.
It simply does not help to proclaim
that we must use them. We cannot do
everything at once. Where do we start?
Which of these unused resources do we
use first?
So we have established first that
development, if it is to be meaningful,
must be more than investment, it must
be socially useful investment. And, sec-
ond, that it is not so much a matter of
using unused resources as of establishing
a system of priorities to program their
utilisation.
A third myth about development is
a confusion of means with end-
objectives. Investment, o'r putting efforts
now into returns tomorrow, is only an
intrinsic objective for those who live by
a puritan ethic of abstention for its own
sake. For most people investment is a
means to an objective of greater bene-
fits or profit tomorrow. In the same way
unused resources are not used simply for
the sake of using them but for further-
ing an objective. The pleasant forest
could be left unchopped, the landscape
unscarred by mining or dams if it were
not that the chopping, and mining, and
damming are regarded as a means to
something which is valued more highly.
Which poses the question in our
dialogue: What objective are we seeking
by these means of investment and the
utilisation of unused resources? And
here we are getting to the crux of the
matter of development.
The real objective of development is
to improve the yield of goods and ser-
vices of the work-force. Development is
no more or no less than improving
national productivity. This established,
a lot of what is peddled in the name of
development is a bloody fraud.
Some investments which are made
roads built, dams constructed, factories
erected do not help the country
develop, they contribute to its anti-
development. By absorbing efforts and
resources in greater measure than they
yield returns they detract from national
productivity.
To be specific, and take an example
on which most economists agree, the
investment of $lOO million in capital
works at the Ord, plus the subsidies
in running costs, not to speak of the
efforts of the farmers in working their

land, is estimated as likely to yield in
earnings through crop sales less than
it has cost. Its establishment is likely
to be a transaction on which there will
be a national loss.
In the case of primary industry we
will generally be following a policy of
anti-development rather than develop-
ment when we expand production of
goods for which the world market is
poor. Now 'it happens that world
markets for natural fibres are weak
because of breakthroughs in technology
which are leading to a substitution of
synthetics, they are also weak because
the overall market for fibres is weak.
And, where the market is weak, what is
needed for economic development is not
a simple expansion of the volume of
production but a cutting of costs so
that we can increase our share of the
world market at the expense of others
—or else a contraction of production.
Cost-cutting is sometimes achieved by
investing in structures which can be
photographed to be captioned “devel-.
opment.” But more often it happens
that it can be done by better manage-
ment, better technology research, and
other efforts less photographable than
dams.
All this would be so elementary as
not to be worth saying, if it were not
for the back-to-front approach which
the Government and politicians so often
apply to development. At the Ord they
brought in the engineers first and asked
them if it was a reasonable place to
build a dam; then they asked the soil
scientists to assure them the irrigable
soil didn’t have any terrible deficiencies;
then the agricultural researchers to try
to develop plants which would grow.
Each was in his own way successful.
By that stage the Government was
already heavily committed. But it was
only at this stage last of all that
they started to put marketing men and
accountants on to working out whether
the market was right, and if the sale
of any of the crops would bring in
sufficient revenues to cover costs and
yield a return on the resources tied up.
The Department of National Anti-
Development (as we might call it for
the occasion) in a booklet on the Ord,
published recently when the Parlia-
ment was voting money for the pro-
ject, made no bones about the fact that
its recent economic survey of the pro-
ject was inconclusive: “It was not pos-
sible to arrive at a definitive economic
result from the national viewpoint or
in the assessment of the likely long-
term position of farmers.” In other
words it cannot claim the project is a
payer for the nation. And it cannot
even claim that with a large bounty on
cotton, and with the benefit of heavily
subsidised water and services of various
kinds, the farmers there will be able to
pay their way.
But the marketing experts and eco-
nomic analysts were brought in too late.
As a result of the activities of the
engineers and agricultural researchers,
local interests have generated political
momentum for this investment and
wrapped it in the aura of “develop-

ment” before anyone can get around to
estimating whether it justifies the title.
Anti-development, through neglecting
to analyse the market, is of course not
confined to the example just quoted.
The expansion of sugar acreage several
years ago and the failure (or extreme
slowness) with which the dairy industry
is being contracted in response to a
weakening, diminishing market are
another aspect of the same problem.
And we can look outside agriculture
right into the middle of the big cities
to find another example of what looks
like anti-development. In the next few
weeks the Premiers of N.S.W. and Vic-
toria will be asking Mr. Gorton for
huge amounts of money for under-
ground railway projects. Even prima
facie, these projects look suspiciously
like urban Ords. The market for public
transportation has been weakening
steadily year by year, so great is the
attractiveness of the individual trans-
portation provided by the motor-car.
And the world over, even where great
amounts of money are being put into
public transport, the importance of
central business districts is declining. As
cities grow, the commercial and manu-
facturing activities they support are be-
coming dispersed and taken out of a
concentrated central area.
And yet in the face of powerful
market forces like this, the State
Premiers want money for extremely ex-
pensive transport improvements. Profit-
ability surveys (“benefit-cost analysis”
in the jargon) have been done on both,
but evidently the results are so de-
pressing in proving these projects to be
matters of undevelopment, that they
have been hurriedly suppressed.
Even in catering to the massive de-
mands of the motor-car, the mere pro-
vision of extra road transport facilities
in the cities is not in itself necessarily
development. It depends on how much
the roadways cost, compared with the
benefits to be gained from them. By
this test there is considerable doubt as
to whether the $25 million that Sydney
put into the lj-mile Warringah Ex-
pressway, opened last week, will give
a fair return on the money spent.
In areas of the economy where goods
and services can simply be sold com-
mercially, whether by private or public
corporations, there is a less acute prob-
lem in ensuring that investment is
actually development. Misuse of the
tariff is the main means by which anti-
development occurs in the manufac-
turing sector.
Behind high-tariff walls industries
develop which cannot possibly compete
with overseas products. Users are
denied access to low-cost imports and
can get less for their money. The in-
vestment which has gone into them is
undevelopment because the overall
amount of supplies being made avail-
able is reduced. Had the investment
been in a low-cost industry which could
replace an import or be exported com-
mercially, national productivity would
have been raised rather than lowered.
This, of course, is a form of anti-
development which, in Australia, the
Tariff Board is currently moving to
avert. Probably one of the main con-
tributions which any government can
possibly make at present to the cause
of national development is simply to
leave the Tariff Board alone. If anti-
development can be minimised in the
private sector of the economy, which
is some 70 percent of the total, then
we are really making progress.
What should emerge from this
dialogue is that development is for a
forced draft, a big effort of concen-
trating resources to build things for the
future rather than enjoy the bene-
fits of our efforts here and now. It
isn’t simply putting effort into dams
and factories rather than into guns or
butter. It is a matter first of careful
assessment of costs and benefits so that
pieces of anti-development can be
weeded out, and a set of priorities for
real development projects established.
It is partly a determination to be
market-orientated in all matters, to pro-
duce the goods and services which are
wanted. This is easiest to achieve with
things that can be sold, because
free trade does a lot of the work of
allocation, and ensuring that invest-
ment goes to the right places. In the
Government sector, where services are
provided without charge and financed
by taxes rather than a sale-price, it
is more difficult to analyse the market
and to choose development rather than
anti-development. But difficult though
it may be, it will always be possible
to make some sort of benefit-
cost or profitability analysis. These
calculations must become a matter of
course for any Government which is
interested in the substance rather than
just the rhetoric of national develop-
ment.
As important as making sure that
there is some set of priorities for
development projects is the realisa-
tion that economic development does
not occur just through projects. It is
a complex interaction of people work-
ing with institutions as well as physical
structures. It is just as essential to
development (often more so) to
eliminate an inefficiency in the use of
a technician as it is to build an extra
bay in a factory.
Development is sometimes described
in summary as a process of identify-
ing and breaking bottlenecks to in-
creased productivity. Sometimes the
bottleneck will be physical, and then
extra structures or machines are re-
quired -- the process of investing.
Sometimes it may be using un-utilised
resources like water. But just as often
it will be persuading a trade union
to abandon a restrictive practice or
providing a new technical institute to
provide a flow of new skills.
Policies for national development
cover the broad brush of economic
policies, and it requires more in the
way of thought and innovation and
education than it does in sweat and
sacrifice.

China’s student-power backlash
PROUDLY claiming credit for
Europe’s “cultural revolution” and the
tempest of violence and destruction
which has shaken France in particular,
the Maoists in Peking do not believe
that President de Gaulle is enjoying
anything more than a temporary res-
pite as Paris returns to normal. The
bloodied students of the Sorbonne, who
spearheaded the rebellion against an
oppressive establishment, are the worthy
disciples of the Red Guards who “over-
threw” the revisionist hierarchy of the
Chinese Communist Party. And they
have been followed by the mass of
“revolutionary” workers in the same
way.
But they may also suffer the same
fate. The Chinese revolution, faithful
to the meaning of the word, has
turned full circle. Communist China is
administered in all but six of its 28
provincial divisions by “revolutionary
committees” of soldiers, civil servants,
and the “rebel” masses which are, in
fact, usually dominated by a small
group of local military leaders and
Party cadres.
This new power group, with its own
vested interest in peace, quiet, and the
new status quo, now frowns on the
street-protests of hot-headed youth, and
while yesterday dissent was ,called
“making revolution” today it is
“divisive factionalism.” During the
past month the champions of the heady
student ferment, so encouraged in 1966,
have had to fight to establish even the
bare claim of the Red Guards to be
respectable rebels at all, and they look
like losing the first round.
The battle opened with an ideological
ruse in questionable taste when an
editorial in the “Red Flag” last month
suddenly upended the class structure
like an abstract painting of indetermin-
ate shape that might look better on its
side. Seen this way up, the imperfect
world was not populated by a “prole-
Student ferment was encouraged in 1966

tariat” of good laboring classes and
a “bourgeoisie” of bad middle classes,
but by “proletarian revolutionaries,”
who were all those loyal to Mao, and
“bourgeois reactionaries,” who were all
those disloyal to him.
This implied that a Shanghai arc-
welder of impeccable peasant pedigree
but deviationist thoughts was no “pro-
letarian.” Conversely, the “petit-
bourgeois” student Red Guard, earlier
condemned for faction fighting with
hand-grenades in the streets of Amoy,
could be one of ours after all. For
since “proletarian” protest was part of
the class struggle against the “bour-
geoisie,” it was those who condemned
or avoided violent factionalism who
were supinely betraying the revolution.
Behind this semantical fencing match
the main rearguard action is being
waged by the mass organisations of Red
Guards and “revolutionary rebels” of
Chinese workers against the new
masters of the provincial committees,
who seem to have stolen their cultural
insurrection from them and then
sabotaged it by restoring law and order.
Each side damns the other as the
true “class enemy,” and provincial com-
manders, often treating the revolution-
ary masses as a public nuisance, have
organised local provost corps
auxiliary security battalions and regi-
ments of obedient workers (usually
armed only with clubs) —who can be
called out to maintain peace, direct
traffic, break up political brawls and
faction fights among the “revolutionary
rebels,” and combat “traitors and
capitalists.”
Exceptionally, Kweichow, in south-
west China, enthusiastically echoed the
“Red Flag” editorial in praise of
factionalism, which was seemingly in-
spired by Madame Chiang Ching, Mao’s
extremist wife and first lady of the
Red Guards. The revolutionary com-
mittee of the province stressed that the
“rebel” masses must persist in their
struggle against “class enemies” who
excluded the millions from sharing
power and gave it instead to a gang of
older cadres riddled with traitors. As
for the provost corps, it consisted of
“Right-wingers” and “royalists who en-
circled the Red Guards.” It must be
attacked and smashed.
But impoverished Kweichow is one
of only six provinces whose revolu-
tionary committees, slowly formed in
1967, have a strong “mass” represen-
tation. The other 22 divisions of China
are either under strict military control
or administered by hastily formed
revolutionary committees on which the
soldiers and civil servants have most
of the say. In the rich and populous
province of Kwangtung, just across
the border from British Hong Kong,
the generals have wrenched power from
the “rdbels.”
The official policy for young
students —most of whom do not appear
to have abandoned their spree in the
streets for study in the classroom —is
that they should learn the works of
Mao, and otherwise apply themselves
in a practical manner to industry, agri-
culture, and military training, “going
down to the peasants, the workers, and
the soldiers” to do so. They may no
longer choose their profession or where
they will go to practise it. Today
they are the compost of a revolutionary
process that must ultimately produce
the classless society, and they are spread
out accordingly over the often barren
ideological soil of China’s seven hundred
million people.
Being human, they object. They
accuse rival factional groups of con-
spiring to send the graduates they do
not like to the farthest, most inhospit-
able places. Students from Swatow, in
south-east China, recently flocked back
from distant farms to their native city,
and when the authorities withheld
ration cards from them on their return
to the town, they went berserk or to
the blackmarket, according to tempera-
ment.
The young of China are in a tricky
mood, quick to refuse to go back to
school, to reject military training as a
waste of time, to repudiate their own
teachers as “reactionary.” While the
moderates like Premier Chou En Lai
wish to reserve all the revolutionary
venom and vituperation for the “hand-
ful of capitalists at the top,” headed by
President Liu Shao Chi, and so
diminish the damage, Red Guards and
extremists sympathetic to Chiang Ching
want to “repudiate” everyone all down
the line who notionally betrays Mao’s
word, starting with the 'brasshats and
the bureaucrats.
The backcloth for this tortured scene
is naturally one of confusion and
violence. Refugees recently described
the situation in Fukien province, oppo-
site Nationalist Formosa, as “completely
out of hand.” Delegates from Peking
sent to settle tempers there were kid-
napped by Red Guards, and despite
the personal intervention of Chou En
Lai mayhem continues. What mayhem?
In Canton, rival Red Guards thrashed
out their differences earlier with rifles,
hand-grenades, heavy machine-guns,
mortars, and even light anti-aircraft
artillery.
Peking may crow over the tumult in
Western Europe, but the Red Guards
now know this: The Paris students and
“revolutionary” workers have started
only upon the first spiral of revolution.
It remains to be seen whether they
will do better or worse than their
Chinese counterparts given that, unlike
Mao, President de Gaulle did not him-
self call them out on to the streets in
the first place in order to confound his
own Government.
Today the young who want to “make revolution” are frowned on as hot-heads
But the students won’t march back home


Nothing to get excited about
By SANDRA HALL
Haydn Thompson ... no dialogue
MIDWEEK at Sydney University.
Few students have time to put down
bulging briefcases long enough to stop
at the Labor Club bookstall outside
the Fisher Library, but three students
are ready to hand out copies of the
club’s newssheet, “Wednesday Com-
mentary,” to those who do.
Top story was the universities’
attitude to the amendments to the
National Service Act. Student meet-
ings had been held, six draft cards
burnt, “sit-ins were demanded by
some,” but (and the phrase has some
significance) “the moderates won the
day.”
Twenty - one - year - old Haydn
Thompson, one of the Labor Club
members at the bookstall, looks like
everybody’s idea of the undergraduate
intellectual: slim, thin-faced, with
glasses, and with plenty of thoughts on
the political climate among students.
He is encouraged by the fact that more
JEANNETTE FREEMAN is a 19-year-
old trainee teacher studying Arts at
Sydney University. She says she her-
self is too apathetic to do so, but be-
lieves students are entitled to protest
and demonstrate.
“I suppose Vietnam is the main issue
-—the one which could bring student
protest out of the universities. Yes, I
agree that conscripts should burn their
draft cards if they object strongly
enough. My political heroes? I don’t
know—Martin Luther King, Gandhi, I
suppose.”
political clubs exist in the university
than before, and that students seem less
apathetic than perhaps five years ago,
“but still a minute percentage of stu-
dents are involved,” he says.
Students as a political force? He
shakes his head. “Even in the radical
clubs there’s not a great connection
with working-class feeling there’s
no dialogue between the two.”
Yet during the past year, he says,
concern for democracy within the uni-
versity has increased, prompted by “the
Humphries issue,” which blew up
because of one student’s stand over the
curiously mundane question of fines on
late library books. “That at least got
the students discussing student repre-
sentation on the Senate. On Vietnam,
the climate has changed from straight
opposition to how much opposition?
And there is a debate going on as to
whether 'or not students should be con-
cerned with things that only affect
them.”
Jim Percy, another Labor Club
member, believes “an upsurge in
radicalism” caused by Cuba, the CND,
and the Civil Rights movement is
being felt throughout Australia.
But at present radicalism is hardly
the prevailing mood at Sydney Uni-
versity. There are perhaps 400 stu-
dents at the lunchtime meeting in the
grounds across from the library. They
sit on the lawn eating sandwiches and
from time to time register a lazily,
DIANE RIDLER is a first-year Social
Studies student who says she was poli-
tically ignorant before she began study-
ing Government this year.
“At school we didn’t have time to
think about it. Now I’m beginning to
read about the student riots, but I’m
still not sure. There are some silly
political organisations here who go
against things just for the sake of it.
All the same ... I don’t think the
Government has a right to delve into
the files. Demonstrations about it? No,
I don’t go along with that. It’s all
right to stand up to their rights, but
they’ve caused so much trouble in
France I can’t make up my mind.”
Jim Percy ... upsurge of radicalism
good-humored reaction to the urgent
phrases spoken by those on the plat-
form.
“I propose that we organise a march
downtown to demonstrate outside the
Department of Labor and Industry in
Chifley Square. We must demand a
written assurance from the Vice-
Chancellor that he will not divulge
information in the university files to
the Department.”
The first proposal provokes a sparse
showing of hands a little more than
a quarter of the assembled students
votes for it. The second is more popu-
lar, but when it is reinforced with the
words “that we convey the decision
of the meeting in force,” there are
doubts. “What sort of force?”
“We adjourn to the Vice-Chancellor’s
office right now. This microphone is
coming across to the VC.’s office.”
A second figure steps up on the dais
and there is a whispered consultation.
MARK MORGAN, who is aged 19,
was a student at San Diego State
University before coming to Sydney
University four months ago.
“I don’t believe in demonstrations.
There must be more legal ways of
going about it. Students should be able
to discuss things, and if they’re per-
sonally affected they should 'take part,
not otherwise.”

“I have just been informed that the
SRC’s microphone is not going any-
where.” A big laugh and a call for
“reasonable action.” “Direct action is
only justified w<hen reasonable action
has been rejected,” a speaker says.
A new figure, with a halo of wild
hair showing against the sun, steps up.
He is angry. “We have these meet-
ings, we pass these motions then
we go back to the pub and have a meat
pie and forget about it. No one takes
us seriously, and the reason is we don’t
do anything. Students in other countries
actually make their feelings felt—they
make personal sacrifices—the only kind
of protest worth while.”
Another speaker follows him. “I’d
like to see the whole 400 here today
march down George Street and show
the public we’re concerned—march into
the Department and take the place over.
It’s the only way we can show the
public and the administration. If we
do nothing today, the whole issue will
fade away.”
It is powerful rhetoric, but not
powerful enough to arouse those lunch-
ing on the grass. “A reasonable written
request” is sent around to the Vice-
Chancellor’s office, the microphone is
returned to the custody of the Students’
Representative Council, and the
students return to their lectures. In the
words of “Wednesday Commentary,”
“the moderates won the day”—that
day, anyway.
AMANDA STARK sees demonstrations
as a last resort, to be used only when
“all else has failed.”
“And then I wouldn’t participate in
any sort of violence. The issues? I
don’t feel very strongly about the
National Service Act. I care more about
Aborigines, but I wouldn’t demonstrate
until I knew everything about it, then
perhaps.
“Political heroes? I have none, except
that I do admire people like Lee Kuan
Yew for statesmanship.”
ANDREW HILL, a 17-year-old Arts
student, says that he, along with most
other students in the early years of
university, has too much work to do
to allow time for political demonstra-
tions.
“Political concern here is in accor-
dance with the things happening here
now. You’d have to feed in something
big to really spark something off. But
there is a minority of politically
active people, and perhaps a few
wanting publicity. But I’d go. about
protest in a different way. I’ve written
letters to newspapers on emotional
things like Vietnam and conscription,
but I think internal university issues
should be kept within the university.
“I haven’t any political heroes,
although I think Gough Whitlam would
make a good Prime Minister, and I
think Wilson’s doing a good job.”
COLIN WADDY, an Arts-Science stu-
dent, is politically active Vithin the
university. He addressed the lunch-
time meeting held to discuss the
amendments in the National Service
Act, urging the students to express
their views more strongly.
After the meeting, he said he
doubted the possible effectiveness of a
downtown demonstration, since the
issue was one to be fought within the
university.
“There are other grievances stu-
dents have within the university, too,
such as university education. There
are too many students per lecture, a
lack of communication, not enough
choice about courses. Students should
protest against all these things.”
RIMVYDAS SKEIVYS, 21, is study-
ing for his M.Sc. degree. “There’s not
much reason to riot,” he said. “I’m a
member of the Sydney University
Squadron, and in favor of conscription,
but I think those who are against
it should be allowed to demonstrate.
“I think that students have a right
to go into the city and demonstrate
within the confines of the law. I’d
demonstrate against something if I
was against it, but there aren’t too
many conflicts here. The most impor-
tant part of a country’s policy is its
foreign policy, and most of the people
I know agree with our current policies.
“I can’t think of any political heroes
I have, but one person I admire is
Dr. Frank Knopfelmacher. I like the
way he presents his arguments. I’m
also an anti-Communist. Someone
once put it to me that ‘Communism
is a disease you get over’ like
Czechoslovakia at the moment • and
I agree with that.”
JEANNIE RUDD, a third-year Arts
student, was reluctant to talk about
politics, since, she said, she knew too
little about it. As for demonstrations
“there’s not enough to object to.
Riots can’t be right if people are get-
ting killed in them in Europe and
America. There must be another way.
“I feel deeply about the Aborigines,
but I’d need someone to impress me
more before I did anything about it.
As for Vietnam, I’m too confused
about it. There’s too much conflict in
my mind.
“Conscription doesn’t touch me very
much, probably because I’m not per-
sonally affected. Yes, if I had a brother
or a boyfriend involved it might be
different. Political heroes? None.”


NCR breaks the price-barrier on computers
with the Century Series through
new technology and automated manufacture.
fianmao
NCR Century computers are the result of years of intensive
research and planning ... the co-ordinated efforts of Engineers,
Technicians, Manufacturing Personnel, Programmers, and
System Analysts. To produce the most advanced computer with
a real breakthrough in cost/performance ratio, NCR employs
the latest developments in miniaturization, standardization and
automation.
Standardization has allowed NCR to capitalize on mass produc-
tion methods without sacrificing reliability. The Century Series
uses only one monolithic integrated circuit as the base element
for all processor and peripheral logic. Six configurations of this
circuit handle all logical functions for processing data. In con-
trast to other systems which use up to 1,200 different types of
printed circuit boards, the Century uses only 81 different circuit
boards, of which 80% are the six standard configurations.
This reduction in number of circuits also results in faster, low-
cost maintenance. Using new hardware/software diagnostic
techniques, service personnel complete their checks quickly.
Standardization of logic simplifies training of service engineers.
Fewer circuits and standardized logic also mean reduced parts
inventory. In effect, a service engineer can keep all spare parts
for logic functions in his desk drawer.
New automated manufacturing techniques mean higher produc-
tion volumes and lower cost per unit. Fully automated fabrication
of the Century’s thin-film, short-rod memory contrasts sharply
with the more costly hand operations involved in the stringing
of the less efficient core memory used in most other computers.
One standard memory plane is used to fabricate all memory
modules. Circuits are inserted on cards, soldered, and tested
by completely automated processes.
These modern production methods contribute to the exception-
ally low cost of the new NCR Century computers. JMCR invites you
to begin your investigation today. Call your local NCR office,

BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY
Waiting for something to turn up
ALL RIGHT, so we have every chance
of going $lOOO million into debt on our
current international account in the
financial year just ending. But does it
matter? Should we tighten the ranks,
chop down on imports, jack up interest
rates, slow down the economy and
export or die? Or should we just coast
along and hope for the best? Despite
the expressions of concern and calls to
action by the Export Development
Council, it looks like a situation that
can be taken fairly calmly.
The EDC should nevertheless be
listened to with respect. Their analysis
of the situation is that confidence in
the present healthy state of business in
Australia is misplaced because of our
poor balance-of-payments position and
uncertain prospects. Exports for 1967-
68 will have shown very little advance
over the previous year when the figures
are released next month or so, while
imports will have increased by $3OO
million. With the net cost of invisibles
rising to around $BOO million this will
give the worst deficit on current
account for 16 years of $lOOO million.
To the confident reply that this does
not matter, because it so happens that
capital inflow will more than offset
this deficit, the EDC’s chairman of its
National Export Week, Mr. A. J.
White, claims that 50 percent of this
capital inflow is portfolio money that is
far less stable than direct investment
and could easily go out of the country
sooner or later.
That is quite true, as is the timely
reminder that all 'this capital will have
to be serviced (if it stays here) and
this will require a rise in exports to
cover it. But it is only one side of the
picture. In the first place, most of the
portfolio investment coming to Austra-
lia in such large lumps (despite official
policies or restraint in Britain and the
U.S., is going into companies that are
either paying no dividend at all or
whose dividends are minute in relation
to the cost of their shares. These com-
panies will not begin to pay large
dividends until they have begun to
earn big profits (which for most of
them means until they are exporting
large amounts of ore of one kind or
another or else replacing imports by
providing the country with petrol). So
big dividend payments will only follow
big increases in export income.
EDC thinks that Australia will have
to double its exports in the next ten
years to cover various outflows like
higher dividend payments, higher
import demands by industry and
higher defence spending. It is clearly
uneasy about . our ability to do so,
since it took 16 years for the last
doubling of Australia’s exports and
as exports have risen by only eight per-
cent over the past five years.
It is true that manufactured exports,
which have risen by an average of 15
percent a year for the past three years,
to provide about one quarter of export
sales (this includes processed raw
materials) face something of a problem
in maintaining their growth rate since
60 percent of their markets are in
countries that have devalued their
currencies. But unless some disaster
strikes Japan (which is always on the
cards, in view of the way the Japanese
run their economy on a wing and a
prayer), the mineral exports we should
be able to churn out in a few years’
time should go a long way towards
adequately covering the situation. And
it might sound like a funny way to run
a country, but it has been a sound
policy in the past to wait for something
to turn up. It usually does.
Resources Development Bank
Dim chances of borrowing abroad
THE GOVERNMENT has to make up
its mind whether it wants the Aus-
tralian Resources Development /Bank to
borrow overseas or not. If it does
and this was one of the objectives
Treasurer McMahon outlined when the
Bank was announced then the Gov-
ernment must make a serious decision
about its police md repatriation of
foreign capital, li cannot leave things
the way they are and hope that the
Bank will be abb' to raise money over-
McMahon —a forgotten objective
seas at reasonable rates of interest.
This seems the heart and soul of the
Bank’s problems with foreign borrowing.
Naturally, the high level of overseas
interest rates is exacerbating it, as the
Bank probably does not feel enthusi-
astic about adding too great a leavening
of foreign cash into its borrowings mix
while this costs so much. But it has a
responsibility to do so whether it wants
to or not.
That seems to be what the chairman
of the Bank, the ES & A’s Mr. H.
McE. Scambler, was really getting at
recently when he said the Bank could
not 'borrow overseas in the current
period of uncertainty unless it was
granted exchange cover by or through
the Commonwealth Government.
The Reserve Bank refuses to allow
any insurance on the exchange risk to
be done because this would effectively
be a guarantee that the capital could
be repatriated from Australia. At
present, Government policy is against
such guarantees. To lend money here,
foreigners must be prepared to run the
risk that they might not be permitted
to withdraw their funds (although they
have never been refused).
The situation is completely different
for foreign-trading transactions; for
these, the Reserve Bank itself will
underwrite the exchange risk against
sterling for the modest premium of ten
cents percent a month and will arrange
forward cover on dollars depending on
the market. The reason for this is that
Australian traders doing business over-
seas have always been obliged (less so
these days) to write their contracts in
foreign currency, and it seemed un-
reasonable that they should have to
carry the burden of the exchange risk.
It is in the interests of a healthy trade
balance for ithe nation as a whole to
insure the exchange risk through the
Reserve Bank.
Is it equally in the interests of the
nation to encourage a healthy inflow
of foreign fixed-interest capital (cer-
tainly a much more socially useful
brand than the acquisitive equity capital
that has been rushing in unchecked)?
The Government does not appear to
think so, although there is no evidence
that it has given the matter any serious


thought in its dealings with the Reserve
Bank.
The official view is that long-term
capital lending does not present the
Government with any obligation to
carry the exchange risk, as there are
commercial ways of providing for it.
Of course this is true; the lender or
the borrower can take on the exchange
risk, with the interest rate charged con-
taining an element of the risk. If the
lender bears it (that is, if he lends in
Australian dollars), then he naturally
must get a high interest rate to take
account of his higher risk; if the bor-
rower bears the risk, then the interest
rate he offers should be lower (and
his costs therefore lower to offset the
capital risks he faces).
But if the borrower takes the risk
(as he would have to in today’s lend-
ing climate) should he be allowed to
lay off that risk?
Government policy at present pre-
vents the Resources Bank from doing
so. The only way it could borrow over-
seas without running an exchange risk
(for which its Australian clients would
eventually have to pay in higher
charges) would be to do so against the
foreign currency in which a client’s
export orders were quoted.
In other words, the Resources Bank
could borrow overseas in its own name
for on-lending to a natural resources
development company if that com-
pany’s export contracts were in the
foreign currency concerned and there-
fore effectively provided the exchange
insurance themselves.
This is not good enough. The Re-
sources Bank is a special case and
should be treated as such. Certainly
it is difficult to argue that all fixed-
interest lending to Australia should
have repatriation guarantees attached
to it (the country might simply not
have the cash available at the time).
But money being lent to the Resources
Bank is not “hot” money, is not the
sort of cash that is likely to go dashing
off around the world. It is money be-
ing attracted here to do a vital job for
a set period of time; the only thing
wrong with it is that so far none has
come here through the Resources
Bank.
If the Resources Bank were allowed
to get exchange cover through its as-
sociate, the Reserve Bank (and there-
fore give its lenders the implied
guarantee of repatriation) its borrow-
ing status in the toughly competitive
Eurodollar market, for instance, would
be greatly upgraded and its overseas
borrowing costs reduced.
Mr. Scambler does not appear to
have been asking the Government for
something for nothing; the Resources
Bank would pay for the service. In
seeking the right to lay off his risks, he
was taking a sensible business decision
and one that gives no suggestion of lack
of official or semi-official confidence in
the Australian dollar. Suggestions that
it does are out of touch with business
reality.
It seems inevitable that if the Re-
MEN AND MATTERS
NORMAN CAMERON COLES is
really the odd man out in the Coles
family; he is the only one of five
brothers not to fee a knight. But at least
he has followed his brothers’ 'footsteps
in the G. J. Coles chain store business;
last week he added the chairman’s job
to that of managing-director which he
took on late last year. So now, Nor-
man is the fourth brother to have held
the dual role of chairman and
managing-director, with Sir Arthur hav-
ing been the only one to miss out on the
chair (but he was the company’s second
managing-director, following Sir Georee
in 1931).
Norman (or “N.C.” as he is known
at Coles) is still well and truly sur-
rounded by the Coles family; there are
six Coles on the nine-man board of
directors three elder brothers, a
cousin, F. G. Coles (all of whom have
retired from executive responsibilities),
N. C. Coles
Lee Rickmore
and a nephew, Robert, the youngest
member of the family on the board,
who looks after public relations.
Then there are more Coles family
members in executive jobs down the
line. There is cousin Wilfred, who is an
associate director and who runs its
N.S.W. side (now by far -the biggest
part of the Victorian-based Coles
empire; with 40 percent of the group’s
sales); nephew Arthur, who looks after
the company’s real-estate in N.S.W.;
and grand-nephew, Miohael, who is
learning the business as a department
manager at Coles’ number three store
at Brunswick.
At 60, and seven times a grandfather,
N.C. is 20 years younger -than his oldest
brother, Sir George, who founded the
chain while Norman was still a boy at
Trinity Grammar, Kew, and follows his
brother, Sir Edgar, who had taken over
the chain from Sir Kenneth five years
ago. N.C. started off his life with
G. J. Coles & Co. the day after he left
school in 1924, as a junior storeman
at its store number one in Collingwood.
The chainstore group that Norman
runs is a very different animal from
that founded by brother George, 54
years ago. Nowadays, Coles makes more
sales from its supermarkets and food
stores than it does from the variety
stores on which the company was based;
Coles only moved into food ten years
ago, but will shortly open its 100th
supermarket.
And under N.C. the company is mak-
ing another new move—into discount
department stores in conjunction with
the S. S. Kresge Co., of Detroit, which
holds 51 percent of the capital of the
venture. The first K-Mart discount
department store will open early next
year in the Melbourne suburb of East
Burwood, and there are plans to spread
them around Australia, but without in-
terrupting the growth of Coles’ tradi-
tional variety and supermarket retail-
ing.
NABISCO’S NEW $lO million factory
at Broadmeadows has still to show its
paces in the local biscuit market, but
at least it got off to a good start when,
this week, Lee S. Rickmore, last year’s
salesman of the year in the U.S. and
president of the parent company, flew
in to open it accompanied by Val B.
Diehl, one of the corporation’s senior
vice-presidents. Obviously, if Nabisco’s
salesmen in their expanded Australian
operation have been infected by the
flare for salesmanship beaming out of
these two, the Australian Biscuit Com-
pany and the others with shares in the
local market are going to have their
work cut out to stay the pace of the
intrusion.
It is not so surprising, perhaps, that
Rickmore himself started in the biscuit
business as a salesman when he joined
the corporation in 1933 at the age of
25, though hardly in the expectation
that he would become chairman. He
did, however, this year, after serving
for seven years as chief executive and
for some years before that as vice-
president in various capacities such as
sales, advertising, and marketing. The
groundwork for this was done at the
University of Logan (1927-31) where
he majored in business administration.
(He later did the assistant managerial
course at the Harvard School of Busi-
ness Administrations.)
Although biscuits (and a lot of other
foods) are his business, Mr. Rickmore
has spread his interests widely in other
fields and has become a tour de force
in American business life with strong
public service attachments. His dir-
ectorships include the Bankers Trust
Company, Carrier Corporation, the
Mutual Life Insurance Company of
New York, Western Electric, the
Grocery Manufacturers of America, the
Economic Club of New York, the
Advertising Council, and the American
Management Association.


sources Development Bank is going to
be able to gear up Australia’s equity
in developmental projects by borrowing
foreign fixed-interest funds, the Gov-
ernment must get around to removing
its objections to insuring exchange
risks, with the effective guarantee that
capital can be repatriated. Surely Aus-
tralia is sufficiently developed (and
foreign fixed-interest funds are suffici-
ently important) to be able to allow
this for the Resources Bank. Its chances
of borrowing heavily abroad at reason-
able interest rates look dim without
such help.
Alumina
New refinery?
INCREASINGLY the focus of Western
Australia is northward, iron ore,
bauxite, petroleum at Barrow Island
and probably offshore all tend to
take attention from the south-west
corner of the big State, the corner
where nearly all, the population huddles
around its sheep and grain. But north
means two separate and widely divided
areas the Pilbara, and the Kim-
berleys and these respectively are as
far removed from Perth as Rockhamp-
ton and Cooktown are from Sydney.
Again last week the Kimberleys were
stealing the Pilbara iron-ore region’s
thunder largely because the Premier,
Mr. David Brand, had headed that-a-
way with a contingent of Pressmen.
On the Amax bauxite project, what
looked like a slip of the tongue reflect-
ing the true position was reported
and then mellowed next day. The
original story was that the company
had established an orebody big enough
to warrant an alumina refinery in the
area. If this is so, the benefits would
multiply themselves out to boost the
whole region.
Amax need 100 million tons to jus-
tify a refinery on the Mitchell Plateau
in the State’s far north. This would
cost about $l5O million and the trem-
endous power demand would open up
new concepts perhaps tidal or
nuclear power. While the Premier and
his party were looking over the few
areas of habitation, prospectors were at
work on behalf of Western Nuclear
(Aust.) Pty. Ltd. one of the main
contractors to the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission.
The American mining company,
which was originally a half-shareholder
in the Mount Newman iron-ore project
with the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.
before BHP came in will not be limited
by a port site, as the iron development
nearly was. And the ore is believed to
be there for the taking. The difficulties
Amax faces are mainly in the terrain
and the fact that the bauxite is widely
scattered, although it is rich.
The Croesus Touch
A BUDGET SKILL NEEDED
TO KICK
THE ECONOMY ON
BY J. C. HORSFALL
IF SCOUTING Budget and wage case
possibilities is more or less a continuing
exercise in Australia it still seemed to
be rather early when, a couple of
months ago in its new quarterly review
(of which the June issue should be out
soon), the Institute of Applied Eco-
nomic Research at Melbourne Univer-
sity, forecast what would befall in both
these major events set for August. It
said in .effect that the Budget would be
a mopper-up of excess consumer spend-
ing power, and also assumed that the
Arbitration Commission would add
$1.70 to the total wage at the economic
case set for the same month. One
thought at the time that Professor
Henderson and his men were being
brave in sticking out their necks so far,
and that they stood a good chance of
having them lopped off by the course
of intervening events.
It will be recalled that one of the
contentious points in the institute’s
prognosis was that fixed investment
would accelerate. Another was that
retail spending was to become much
more buoyant. Admittedly only three
months have passed, but so far both
fixed investment and retail spending
have been hanging fire and show little
sign of lifting much before the fateful
month of August.
In fact, though the minerals share
boom is having enlivening effects here
and there on consumer spending, high
Government spending, and investment
continues to help economic activity in
general, as if it will need restraining
measures in the Budget to keep it in
check. This is not to say of course that,
mopping up aside, special expenditure
on defence, say, might require the
Treasurer to increase taxation or for
the Arbitration Commission to act with
restraint in its adjudication of the now
well-geared claims for higher wages.
One of the reasons for the failure
of the economy to kick on in reflection
of the massive flow of overseas funds
this year (this appears to have been
stronger than ever in May, when net
apparent capital inflow got up to a
monthly record of about $44 million
after easing off in the previous month)
is of course the curbing effect of not.
devaluing the dollar last November.
In defence of the decision it would
certainly be good economic logic to
increase taxation in the Budget and also
to put the brakes firmly on wage in-
creases. If the wages tribunal in New
Zealand could find cogent reason to
freeze wage levels there last week, when
at least devaluation would on sound
economic reasoning provide some scope
for increasing them, the Arbitration
Commission here (if it pays full regard
V to the economics of the matter, and the
August total wage case will be exactly
about these) will have to be at least
equally as tough as if it is to follow
the economic dictates of Australia’s
decision not to devalue.
As for the Budget, if, after discount-
ing the possible political repercussions
the Treasurer is still undecided on the
score of increasing taxation for defence
purposes or to reinforce the dollar it is
to be hoped —in line with his sympathy
with the accumulating list of problems
of the export industries, particularly the
rural one, which he expressed in Mel-
bourne last week —that he will have
measured the likely aggravation any in-
crease in taxation would have on their
vulnerability to further cost increases.
On top of the effects of devaluation on
their returns from exports and costs
increases already on the board most
rural industries would regard an in-
crease in taxation at this stage as the
last discomforting straw.
What is more, it becomes more
obvious every day such as with
ALCOA’s aluminium price increases
and the mooted ones for steel by
BHP, that a welter of cost inflation
pressure built up in the past few years
is bound to come out before long. As it
does so it will further reduce the tax-
able capacity of the unsheltered indus-
tries.
The most remarkable thing about the
economy since the last Budget is that
despite the Government’s failure to ful-
fil its intention to provide more room
for the private sector, and despite the
Government’s own failure to keep with-
in the bounds of its expenditure esti-
mate, both on revenue and capital
works accounts, consumer prices have
been more stable than at any time in
the past three years. If there is a
danger of this relative price stability
being breached, it is the possibility that,
in the event of farm incomes recovering
strongly over the next year, the Gov-
ernment still continues its own escala-
tion of expenditure. The economy has
been able to tolerate, nay, benefit from
the escalation of Government expendi-
ture in the past year or so, simply be-
cause this has appositely filled the
breach in the income generating struc-
ture resulting from the slow perform-
ances of fixed capital investment
and the rural sector. If the Govern-
ment continued to escalate its expen-
diture in a setting where both farm in-
comes and fixed investment were mov-
ing up strongly, such escalation would
be highly dangerous to price stability.
It is most conceivable that in the
course of next year, we could be in
such a situation. But we are certainly
not in this situation now. If anything,
the domestic economy would seem to
require some stimulus from the Budget
to get it moving rather faster than it is,
even if to do this might well be to
court devaluation.

11 months of 1967-68.
Australia’s wool cheque for 1967-68 will be at

local share-market activity. Early enthusiasm dried up
later in the week, so that indexes for non-ferrous

Companies: bhp’s iron and steel output in the latest
year to May rose 4.1 percent, almost half the
previous year’s growth.
David Jones went south of the border for an investment
in Ball and Welch to cement its relationship with the
Melbourne retailer for whom it has bought in London
for some time; coincidentally, the Bourke’s appliance
retailing group, which held 10 percent of Ball and Welch,
sold its holding to an unnamed buyer . . .
Permewan Wright profit rose to a peak $1.23 million
in the year to March, on turnover of $7B million,

HOW TO PROFIT
FROM OPTIONS
If a share you are interested in
seems due for a rise then a Call
Option is the way to take advan-
tage of this situation. For a limited
outlay, that you know in advance,
you are in a position to profit from
your stand in' the market. If you
are wrong and the share does not
rise as expected, or even falls in
value, you are not committed to
buy the share—you merely take no
further action. An Option is an
option not an agreement to
buy stock. This point and many
others are explained in our free,
educational brochure that’s yours
for the asking. Just call in,

Speculator’s Diary
ON THE PREMISE THAT
ICE-CREAM
PRICES WILL RISE
GILBERT & SULLIVAN may not
have been stock-exchange speculators,
but they at least had a grasp of the
most simple and elementary of all eco-
nomic laws —'the law of supply and
demand. Many of today’s speculators
would do well to remember it. It is
fine when, as at the moment, demand
is well ahead of supply, but when the
reverse is the case:
“The end is easily foretold,
When every blessed thing you hold,
Is made of silver or of gold,
You long for simple pewter.
“The Gondoliers”
A company that is not as subject to
the whims of the supply-and-demand
formula as a lot of today’s high fliers
is Consolidated Milk Industries. How-
ever, because of regular and persistent
rumors that the company is going to be
taken over, its share turnover is well
above what would normally be ex-
pected on a stock of its kind.
In recent months turnover has been
running at a monthly rate of just under
100,000 shares (or about 2 percent of
the company’s capital). The takeover
rumors mainly concern Foremost
Dairies Inc., of San Francisco, Cali-
fornia, which first became associated
with the company in 1962 and which
now owns 20 percent of its capital.
The shares were initially issued to
the American company in exchange for
technical know-how, formulas, trade
marks, and other various rights.
The reason that the takeover rumor
has been so persistent lately is be-
cause the president of Foremost re-
cently (February) joined Consoli-
dated’s board.
My main reason for buying into
Consolidated, and I have done so to the
extent of 200 shares, is because I think
it is a reasonable recovery prospect.
Its long and bitterly fought battles
for the maintenance of a sensible ice-
cream price now seem to be over, and
prices are again at levels which allow
manufacturers a fair profit margin.
The prices are not quite back to what
they were before Devondale started
hacking away at them, but they are
at least considerably improved. Un-
fortunately, the truce on prices was not
reached in time to assist the company
very much in the first half of the cur-
rent financial year (May to October)
but the year’s final result should show a
very marked improvement. It was work-
ing on the premise that Consolidated’s
share prices should increase along with
ice-cream prices that I made my pur-
chase.
Another company that is sure to do
better in 1967-68, not that it hasn’t
done well so far, is Wreckair —the old
Whelan the Wrecker group. The com-
pany is a hirer of building equipment
and is another like Leighton Con-
tractors, which I mentioned (and
bought) last week, that should do ex-
tremely well from the current boom in
construction work. Last year its divi-
dend was 11 percent and it was covered
2.6 times by earnings. This year the
coverage and/or the dividend gives
every indication of being substantially
healthier. It is one well worth watch-
ing.
This week, I sold off my Papuan.
Apinaipi. I just couldn’t resist look-
ing at the profit any longer without
cashing it in. It came to $ll6O.
Incidentally, I also ■ received this
week the new CBA shares which came
through the holding in General Credits.
The terms were one-for-three.

Some big gaps between share
prices and realisable assets
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
WITH SO MANY company raiders
and “first in, first served” merchants
around, there is a lot to be said for
having a good look at those companies
whose realisable assets are valued at far
greater per share than the shares them-
selves are fetching on the stock market.
And it is astounding how many shares
there are in this situation; almost all
the motor vehicle distributors, most tim-
ber distributors, meat, and sugar com-
panies, and many textilers.
Many of those with big gaps between
market price for the shares and stated
assets backing per share would be un-
likely to get anything like their book
values in a dismemberment. But there
are many with valuable real estate that
could well provide far more than the
assets backing reveals. (For instance,
Henry Jones’ assets are shown as $5.78
a share against sales for the shares at
around the $3 mark. Yet the real value
of Henry Jones’ assets, particularly
properties held for more than 50 years,
would be worth far more than their
book values.) And there are many
others whose assets could be made to
work more efficiently under new
management or as part of a larger
group.
Some of the companies in this con-
dition are simply going through a diffi-
cult period, like Anderson’s Seeds,
whose problems have 'turned out to be
more severe in the balance sheet than
they appeared in the preliminary state-
ment of loss. Anderson’s assets backing
is about 74 cents a share against recent
prices around 48 cents. And with
reasonable prospects of recovery they
could be a most interesting stock.
There are some big and impressive
companies in this category. The two big
woolbroker-pastoralists, Dalgetys and
Elder Smiths, both have their shares on
at lower than their assets backing, with
Dalgetys shares at $5 against assets of
$5.76 and Elders shares fetching $2.92
against an assets backing of $3.42. Other
large companies include DFC with a
market price of $4.60 against assets of
$5.16; Clyde Industries with a market
price of 85 cents against assets of $1.62
and McPhersons with a market price of
$3.20 and assets of $4.
Some of the more spectacular differ-
ences are in stocks that have found the
going tough recently, such as Acron
with a market price of 35 cents and
assets (at book value) of $1.13; Fred
Ash $2.10 and $5.11; Associated Rural
19 cents and 62 cents; Beau Monde
$ 1.85 and $4.42; Henry Berry 31 cents
and 85 cents; Bliss Welded 40 cents and
80 cents; BCH 14 cents and 46 cents;
Captain Products $l.BB and $3.22;
Cheapa Glass 80 cents and $2.22; Felt
and Textiles 67 cents and $1.09; Drug
Houses $1.35 and $2.22 (giving some
added logic to suggestions that Wash-
ington Soul may well be interested in
■the company).
Other interesting stocks in this group
are Cellulose, the South Australian
papermaker, Consolidated Milk, Feder-
ated Industries, General Industries,
International Resistance, Marrickville,
Minster, Olding Equipment, and
Pioneer Industries.
ONE OF THE attractions of H. C.
Sleigh noted in the Bulletin of June 15,
its holding of Timor Oil shares, now
turns out to be not quite as good as it
looked to us. We had said that H. C.
Sleigh would get tax benefits through
its purchase of these shares; this is un-
likely to be so, for the tax deduction
is limited to one third of calls paid
to a company carrying on mining or
prospecting operations in Australia for
gold, silver, base metals, rare minerals,
or oil as its principal 'business. As a
correspondent points out, Timor is
certainly exploring for minerals in
Western Australia, but it would have
to demonstrate that this mineral ex-
ploration was its principal business, and
not exploring for petroleum on Timor.
The new amendments to the act will
have no effect on Sleigh’s acquisition
of Timor shares. But we still consider
that even without any benefits of tax
concessions on its Timor purchase,
H. C. Sleigh is an interesting stock.
AS THE AD says, when you’re on a
good thing, stick to it. That is what
Graeme Moir did with WMC, and what
the Cowan Investment Service has
done with Peko-Wallsend. Peko has
been Cowan’s “best buy” for more than
a year, and it still is, despite its rise
in price from $2.40 to $l4 in the mean-
time. In a series of publications to
clients of his service, Jim Cowan lists
Peko as first choice for a current port-
folio as he thinks there is a “strong
possibility” that the shares will move
up to $2O some time this year.
Apart from 'this, Cowan finds Peko
undervalued in relation to other min-
ing stocks; he suggests that its current
price-earnings ratio of 20 times
expected earnings in 'the coming
financial year looks very modest
indeed against the p.-e. ratios at pres-
The Chartist says:
UNITED URANIUM N.L. was first recommended in January, 1967, when prices
were about 72c. An upward price movement continued, with prices rising to a high
of $2.20 recently. At various times fast intermediate trend rates have been
followed. The situation now calls for reassessment, as a move of major importance
seems likely on technical grounds. Uranium is still obviously a growth situation and
targets close to $3.50 and $4.40 are indicated for the short to medium-term. Last
sale price on 20/6/68 —$2.05.

HOECHST LEADERS IN CHEMISTRY


C. T. Bowring & Co. Limited
Extracts from Mr. lan Skimming’s
Statement on the year’s results
RESULTS. "Your Company’s profits before tax
for the year 1967 were £3,358,000 compared with
£2,369,000 for the previous year.
C.T.BOWRING(INSURANCE)HOLDINGS.
The profits attributable to this Company before
tax were £2,843,000 from which it will be seen
that it makes the major contribution to the
Group’s overall profit
THE BOWRING STEAMSHIP COMPANY.
The results of this Company were disappoint-
ing. Net profit before tax amounted to only
£42,000. There are indications that during the
year 1968 there will be a substantial improve-
ment In profitability, provided that circumstan-
ces over which we have little or no control do
not again affect its operations.
C. T. BOWRING TRADING (HOLDINGS).
This Company now acts as the management
company for the Group’s trading interests. The
consolidated profit of these interests during the
year 1967 amounted to £102,000 before tax. This
overall profit was adversely affected by terminal
losses in various trading activities which have
now been discontinued. Hence I believe that
there are valid reasons to think that the year 1968
will show an improvement
CONCLUDING COMMENTS. Results to date
of the current year bear out the confidence we
have in our ability to increase the efficiency and
profitability of all our operations, although un-
seen complications and setbacks undoubtedly
lie ahead, as they do in the field of all human
endeavour."

ent prices for other mining leaders
against their forecast earnings in three
years’ time.
He says that BHP is now selling for
about 27 times what he estimates its
earnings to be in 1971; WMC at 46
times; CRA at 30 times; Mt. Isa at
26 times. And he thinks they are
worth these prices because they can
reasonably expect further substantia]
increases in earnings during the 19705.
He concedes that Peko’s earnings will
probably not rise to the same degree
as WMC’s after 1971 (unless there is
a rise in the price of gold), but the
difference between Peko and the other
miners listed in the table should not
be as great as the p.-e. ratios indicate.
So Cowan suggests a ratio of around
27 would be more realistic for Peko,
which would mean its price should be
up around $2O. And all this is based
on a conservative view of Peko’s likely
profits next year; a higher price of
gold than the official $31.50 an ounce
or a better price for copper than his
forecast of $B5O a ton would bring them
in better earnings and the free price
for both these metals is, at present, well
above these levels, and seems likely to
remain so. And then there is still the
possibility that the official price of
gold could rise also, with a doubling
being the Cowan expectation.
THE JAPANESE 'STEEL mills buy-
ing cartel have closed ranks again in
a neat way following the company-to-
company sale of Hamersley Iron’s ore
to Nippon Kokan. This sale, according
to a report by the Japanese trading
concern C. Itoh and Co., was precipi-
tated by breakdown in plans for the
Western Australian Mount Gibson iron
project.
NKK needed sintering fines for their
Fukuyama blast furnace, due to start
operating next year, and apparently
were banking on Mount Gibson going
ahead. C. Itoh claims: “NKK’s im-
patient demand stems from the fact
that NKK had to give up developing
the Mount Gibson project in Western
Australia due to complexities of ore
bodies to be mined and unavailability
of a suitable port nearby.”
There has been considerable discus-
sion about whether Geraldton or
Fremantle should be used as the outlet
port; Fremantle was thought to be
favored although Geraldton was slightly
nearer. The Mount Gibson group in-
cluded Nissan Steamship Co., T. Kaki-
uchi and Co., and the NKK subsidiary
Kokan Mining Co. Plans had been
announced for an $lB million pellet
plant with a two-million-ton annual
throughput, the ore to be shifted in
60,000-ton carriers (which could have
been accommodated at Geraldton only
with spectacular changes to the har-
bor).
After Mount Gibson failed to pro-
duce, NKK went direct to Hamersley,
but this was frowned on by other steel-
makers. “It was not fair for NKK, hav-
ing a share of only 14 percent in the
original Hamersley contract, to receive
benefit only to themselves from the
lower price applicable for the addi-
tional tonage in Hamersley’s third
offer,” C. Itoh points out with righteous
indignation.
“As a result, a compromise has been
made so that each member mill pur-
chases from Hamersley according to its
share in the original Hamersley con-
tract and then immediately assigns
30 percent of lump and 100 percent of
fines to Nippon Kokan at Hamersley’s
offered price, with the remaining 70
percent of lump being assigned to
Nippon Kokan at the higher price in
the original Hamersley contract. This
enables the other mills to obtain bene-
fit also from the lower price offered
by Hamersley, although NKK alone
was interested in the offer.
“The foregoing certainly indicates
something about how strongly the spirit
of the joint purchasing method has
been maintained by Japanese steel mills
and how difficult it is for each member
to endeavor to make a single iron-ore
contract on a large scale themselves.”

Behind the balance sheets
Hudson’s double attraction
THERE IS A simple mathematical
attractiqn about George Hudson Hold-
ings Ltd. that has nothing to do with
its profitability—or lack of it. It is
the fact that Hudson’s has $2 million
of surplus property for sale, while the
company’s total capitalisation on the
stockmarket is only $1.3 million. So
a buyer of its shares at 24 cents is
getting about 36 cents of disposable real
estate in addition to a stake in a timber
company that looks fairly close to get-
ting back on its feet after a prolonged
period of severe ill health.
So, there are two strings to George
Hudson’s somewhat battered bow. The
first is the prospect of a takeover either
by a rival timber operation or by an
expert in company necrophilia with
dismemberment as his objective. The
second is the prospect that Hudson’s
could get rid of their surplus property
and use the funds to put the company
back on to profits. (Knocking $2 mil-
lion off the $2.4 million overdraft would
save $140,000 a year in interest apart
from rates, land taxes, and insurance
on the properties. This would put the
company well into the black at last,
after six years of continued disaster—
provided trading conditions continue
to be no worse than in the fairly rea-
sonable year that is just ending.)
The key to Hudson’s immediate
stockmarket future lies in finding a
buyer for seven or eight acres of
waterfront land in Sydney. The com-
pany has a property on Blackwattle
Bay going for $1,360,000 or there-
abouts.
And if such a buyer were listed, and
could acquire the whole of George
Hudson’s in a share exchange, then it
could afford to be pretty generous. For
example, an offer of par value for
Hudson’s 5,250,352 50c shares (or
double the present price) would be
worth $2,625,176 and would bring in
this Glebe waterfront property, a
couple of nearby Glebe properties
priced for sale at $190,000, eight acres
of industrial land at Silverwater, on
the market for about $450,000, being
surplus to Hudson’s needs, plus the
Hudson timber business as a going con-
cern. Hudson’s manufacturing is now
based at Silverwater on ten acres, and
the group has been reconstituted from
being an overblown timber importer-
wholesaler-merchant into a specialist
supplier of builders and similar con-
sumers with everything from rough-
sawn timber to sophisticated ceilings
and partitions, together with the neces-
sary service. It has a fair chance of
making a go of things.
As a break-up or takeover proposi-
tion, shareholders’ funds, net of in-
tangibles, represented a tangible asset
backing per share of 41c at last balance
date. As total freeholds were in the
books at $1.74 million and the com-
pany is not selling all its freeholds,
capital profits are expected. (The
surplus Silverwater property is in the
books at a negligible figure.)
The company is asking $4 a square
foot for the main Glebe property, which
is the same as has been paid recently
for industrial land at Artarmon with
no water access, so the company feels
the price is not excessive, although
'buyers with no need of a waterfront-
age could buy roughly the same size
property at Silverwater from Hudson’s
for around $450,000.
Firm negotiations have been entered
into at one time or another with several
prospective buyers for the Silverwater
property, but so far these have not led
to any fruition.
The 50c shares of this company have
run up from 16c to 25c this year, and
have been more actively sought lately.
The motive is capital gain, not in-
come, for after accumulating losses of
$983,000 in the profit and loss account,
dividend is still some years off. In
March, the company expected to con-
tain its loss in 1967-68 to under
$lOO,OOO, but certain continuing prob-
lems may prevent this target from being
achieved.
Nevertheless, the December quarter
of the current financial year was profit-
able, but not enough to prevent the
result for the first half from being a
small loss.
The company ran into a loss of
$347,000 in 1962, a couple of small
losses in 1963 and 1964, a nominal
profit in 1965, then losses of $316,000
in 1966 and $673,000 in 1967. The
extensive reorganisation of the company
in the past two years was a costly
procedure, 'but at least it is non-
recurring.
Stocks-were reduced from $2.24 mil-
lion to $1.67 million in the year to
June 30, 1967, and, considering the
necessity for increased stocks at Silver-
water, and the Grafton sawmill-
parquetry complex, this represented a
substantial reduction. Similarly, debtors
were cut from $1.62 million to $1.29
million after $222,000 doubtful debtors
provision.
The reorganisation (and the rolling
of many heads in it) started after
management consultants looked the
plan over. Early in the 1965 calendar
year, Hudson’s board decided on a
major reconstruction, including taking
advantage of timber leases and build-
ing a modern sawmill at Grafton.
Hudson had been a large importer-
merchant, diversified into supplying
indigenous timbers in Wangan (near
Innisfail, North Queensland), Quean-

beyan and Grafton (N.S.W.), and out
into the timber markets with joinery,
project building, and retailing.
The muscling in on the Australian
timber importing business by foreign
giants like Weyerhauser, when timber
import restrictions were removed,
forced local companies to look else-
where for their profits. Hudson’s still
does some importing for its clients, but
Weyerhauser is believed to have aimed
for about 40 percent of the import
trade, and imports, at least in 1965-66
accounted for about 30 percent of
Australian consumption.
Hudson’s reorganisation was based on
closing the joinery shop in October,
1966, eliminating the wholesale trade
to merchants in February, 1967, and
withdrawal from project building in
September, 1967.
Manufacturing operations at Glebe
and Silverwater were amalgamated and
rationalised at Silverwater.
Reduction of the company’s Glebe
staff gives an idea of the pruning
which the management has had to do.
In six months last year overheads were
reduced 25 percent.
Wangan Mill burned out in January,
1967, was rebuilt at a cost of SIBO,OOO
and in production again in September,
1967, and the new hardwood sawmill
at Grafton cost $500,000 and went into
operation in April, 1967.
Designed capacity of the Grafton
mill, to take full advantage of the
licences available from the Forestry
Commission, was 20,000 super feet a
day. The mill is highly automated but
had teething problems and a two-
shift operation was necessary.
The parquetry plant, which was
moved from Silverwater to Grafton
with the assistance of a $170,000
Government subsidy for decentralisa-
tion, is producing quite well.
The Donoghoe and Hopkins sub-
sidiary has a hardwood yard and saw-
mill at Queanbeyan, a store at Fysh-
wick in the A.C.T., and at Wagga.
Timber service centres are also oper-
ated at Glebe, Regents Park, and
Sutherland, and, of course, Grafton
and Wangan provide facilities to the
trade in northern N.S.W. and northern
Queensland.
At the moment, the industry looks
good. Building approvals (which pre-
cede commencements by two or three
months) show a 16 nercent improve-
ment for houses and flats in N.S.W. in
the ten months to April, 1968, com-
pared with the corresponding period of
1966-67, and for all other new build-
ings a 26 percent improvement. This is
Hudson’s main market. But in Can-
berra, approvals for the fiscal year to
date showed a 27 percent drop for
houses and flats (Hudson’s complained
in March this was a soft spot), and a
4 percent reduction in approvals of
other new buildings.
Hudson’s are encouraged, though, by
the strong upward move in Canberra
non-dwelling commencements, which
showed nearly 60 percent improvement
in the first two quarters of the current
financial year.
The partitioning part of the business
is quite slack, however, reflecting the
50 percent slump two years ago in
commencements of Sydney office build-
ings that are now nearing completion.
This market is, therefore, very competi-
tive, with margins slim.
This old family company, which is
now well and truly under professional
management, housed a few skeletons in
the cupboard which have been firmly
ejected. The whole managerial team
has been strengthened. The Hudson
family (which engaged in recurrent
argument at company meetings) has a
fairly big share interest, which could
still be controlling. But family pride
can often be buried if the price of a
takeover offer is good enough.

Security analysis
Larke’s: one more step up the
profit ladder
LARKE CONSOLIDATED has a
reputation in the sharemarket of being
regarded as a reliably good dividend
payer —there have been 33 successive
years of a dividend of not less than 10
percent —'but the market downgrades
the stock, assuming little scope for
capital appreciation. The current divi-
dend yield of 8.4 percent is viewed as a
fair and reasonable discount for a com-
pany with a larger stake in the chancy
business of motor-vehicle distribution.
This reputation was deserved a few
years ago, but not in 1968, and a closer
look at the company might prove re-
warding.
The Larke group describes itself as a
“motor industrialist and product
engineer.” In 1968 only 32 percent of
the company’s group funds are invested
in motor-vehicle distribution, while
28 percent is in motor-vehicle assembly,
body-building, and general engineer-
ing, and the balancing 40 percent in
activities completely outside the motor
industry.
On a profit dissection, the non-motor
sector of the company should contribute
about 40 percent of group income in
1968, and the collective rate of profit
growth of the non-motor interests is
about 10 percent a year. In the Larke
camp is the dominant producer of
ladders in Australia and the second-
largest producer of chains in Australia.
The group operates a total of 13 fac-
tories spread throughout all mainland
States and the total enclosed factory
space covers some 630,840 sq. ft. Group
turnover in 1968 is in the vicinity of
$25 million and the group workforce
is almost 1800.
The founder of the Larke empire
was William Bain Larke, born in
Oshawa, Canada, in 1872. Larke’s
father was the first Canadian Trade
Commissioner ever to be appointed—
and the Larke family settled in Sydney
in 1896. In 1901 W. B. Larke and his
brother, Fred, started a small business
trading in bicycle tyres imported from
Canada on a capital of $lOO. This
business was extended later to include
bicycle parts, complete bicycles,
sewing-machines, oats, palm seeds, and
pianos. In January, 1906, the N.S.W.
agency for the 7 hp Star car, made by
the Star Engineering Co. Ltd. of the
U.K., was taken on, and it was decided
to incorporate a company to be known
as Larke Hoskins & Co. for the express
purpose of marketing motor vehicles.
Will Hoskins, who was W. B. Larke’s
partner in the new venture, was related
by marriage to Larke.
Larke Hoskins & Co. Ltd. was
registered in August, 1907, with an
initial paid capital of $l6OO, and the
Larke history recalls that turnover in
the first year amounted to $138,000,
ten vehicles were sold, and net profit
was $142. Hoskins retired from the
business in 1908 and his place was
taken by N. J. Neave, who was also
related by marriage to W. B. Larke.
Larke remained as chairman of the
company until 1945, when he died at
the age of 73, and the company was
still largely a Larke family business
until the mid-19505, when both P. J.
Larke, W. B. Larke’s brother, and
Claydon Neave, N. J. Neave’s son,
retired.
The Larke family are still active
shareholders in Larke Consolidated,
owning possibly 10 percent of the
capital, and the family is represented
on the board by W. R. Locke, the
son-in-law of W. B. Larke. In the
current management team P. S. Hard-
castle, aged 50, is the chief executive
officer with the ititle of president, and
he has a team of senior executives
whose average age is about 40.
In motor-vehicle distribution, the
company is the largest-volume BMC
retailer in Australia, handling about 24
percent of all BMC vehicles sold in
the Sydney metropolitan area. Larke is
a Sydney metropolitan dealer for BMC,
and branches are operated in Canberra
and Tamworth. The company is also
a N.S.W. distributor for BMC parts.
Larke’s motor-vehicle manufacturing
activities are centred on Pressed Metal
Corporation, which is 70 percent owned,
with the balance of capital held by
Rover Co. Ltd., now a subsidiary of
British Leyland Motors. Pressed Metal
assembles the Land-Rover under a
long-term agreement with Rover (the
original agreement with Rover was con-
cluded in 1956), and is a contract
assembler of the Datsun 1600 for the
Nissan Motor Corporation and also
panel vans and MG Midgets for BMC.
Hie contract with Datsun gives Larke
a very good hedge if Japanese car sales
maintain their present rate of growth.
Together with its subsidiary, A. B.
Denning (about 80 percent owned),
three factories are operated—two in
Sydney and one in Brisbane. As a
motor - vehicle body - building group,
Pressed Metal accounts for in excess
of 25 percent of Australian total bus
registrations. The company also makes
a range of metal caskets, and does sub-
contract pressing and tooling work.
In the non-motor field, Rogers Chain,
acquired in 1962, and Harper David-
son Industries, acquired in 1967, are

with about 10 percent of the total
Australian chain market in its grasp —
the annual Australian demand currently
runs to about $7 million a year—pro-
duces heavy-duty industrial chain from
10,0001 b. breaking load up to 1.2 mil-
lion lb. breaking load.
Imports represent about 50 percent
of the total market, dominating mainly
in the smaller chain field, and Rogers,
with a manufacturing and distributing
agreement now signed with Yamakyu
Chain Co. (the No. 2 chain company
in Japan), expects to become a sig-
nificant force in this field as they are
in the manufacture of the larger-
capacity chain. Rogers will market the
Yamakyu chain under the trade name
“Maxton,” and the range will cover
small-pitch precision roller chain and
light-duty conveyer chain. The annual
rate of growth in demand for chain
is about 12i percent a year.
Harper Davidson Industries, whose
accounts were consolidated as from
July, 1967, was acquired for cash at a
cost of just over $1 million. Before
acquisition this company, controlling
over 50 percent of the Australian ladder
market, was able to double its turnover
from $500,000 to more than $1 million
over the past five years, and the current
estimated annual rate of growth is in
excess of 10 percent. Catering for every
ladder-user’s need, with experience
dating back to 1898 and producing
ladders in timber, steel, and aluminium,
Harper Davidson claims to be one of
the largest ladder-making companies in
the world. Factory units operate in all
five State mainland capital cities. In
July, 1968, another Larke Consolidated
ladder subsidiary, Lyte Metal Indus-
tries, acquired by the group in 1960,
will be integrated with Harper David-
son and this rationalisation should
further improve profitability.

in 1951, producing the whole of Aus-
tralia’s cotton-baling bands require-

acquired in 1965, dealing in plastic

acquired in 1965, a medium-sized print
house in offset and letterpress. All have
their operations centred in Sydney.
The statistics suggest a static per-
formance in recent years, but the in-
terim report released in February, 1968,
shows how diversification is now begin-
ning to really pay off. Pre-tax profit for
the six months to December, 1967, rose
by 30.1 percent, compared with the six
months ended December, 1966, and
although the post-tax profit rose by only
5.4 percent over the comparable period
of 1966, the full year’s results to June
should show a record profit. The de-
tailed interim report showed that sales
of Pressed Metal Corporation rose by
25.9 percent in the period under review
due to a sharp increase in production
of bus bodies.
A one-for-ten bonus issue was made
to shareholders in March, the first issue
to shareholders since the one-for-three
in 1956.
At $0.89, the shares have a dividend
yield of 8.4 percent and the price earn-
ings ratio on the enlarged capital is 6.4.

From start to finish, A-Z Zinc is 100% Australian.
It is produced in Australia under the watchful eye
of the chemists and metallurgists of an all-
Australian company, Electrolytic Zinc Company of
Australasia Limited. It is used by hundreds of
Australian companies. So much so that every year'
Australia uses more zinc per head of population
than any other country. About twice as much, in
fact. And it’s earning Australia around $25,000,000
in export income every year. In countries like the
U.S.A., United Kingdom, Germany, India and
twenty-six others. All in all, a valuable
contribution to Australia’s continuing prosperity.

Magellan's wide-flung explorations
WITH SO MANY drills going down,
there is plenty of interest in the oil
market right now. But one of the most
interesting of oil stocks is Magellan
Petroleum NL, which, with its partners,
is spudding-in two significant wells this
week. The Tyler well, in which Magel-
lan has a 39 percent interest, is a key
well in the Amadeus basin, and the
Ravensbourne well near Blackall in
southern Queensland is 34 percent
owned.
Magellan’s 1968 program of drilling
•three prospects is to test the Pacoota
formation of Ordovician age, regarded
as the most promising target in the
Amadeus basin. East Mereenie No. 4
demonstrated that oil can be produced
in commercial quantities from Pacoota
reservoir rocks in the Mereenie field,
where there is an estimated 500 million
barrels of oil. Fresh success in this area
might swing the balance to commercial
production from this geographically
remote area, 900 miles from the nearest
refinery. Tyler and the next on the
drilling program, West Waterhouse, are
both large structures by world stan-
dards. The third, North-west Mereenie,
is smaller.
Primary targets of the Tyler well are
the Stairway sandstones below 10,000
feet, and the Pacoota sandstones below
12,000 feet, which contained the large
hydrocarbon reserves in the Mereenie
field. The Pacoota oil reservoirs could
yield oil at much higher rates than
were obtained from East Mereenie No.
4 (160 to 350 barrels a day according
to choke size), where mechanical prob-
lems resulted in damage to the well
bore. The company will take preventive
measures if successful this time to im-
prove natural flow rates, and conven-
tional fracturing techniques could
stimulate productive flow to two or
three times the volume.
Whether nuclear explosions can be
used to increase production rates and
recovery from the tight reservoir rocks
of the Mereenie field depends on con-
firmation of results of the American
Operation Gasbuggy experiment by the
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, U.S.
Bureau of Mines, and El Paso Natural
Gas Co., now expected in the latter
part of this year. Gasbuggy was per-
formed on a New Mexico gas field, and
similar conditions prevail in the
Mereenie field. Ideal depth is 3000-
4000 feet, so there is no chance of
venting, and in gas or oilbearing sands
two to three hundred feet, which Magel-
lan has at Mereenie, although its depth
is 4000-5000 feet. Radioactivity was
appreciably less than theoretical calcu-
lations, and altogether Magellan is
pretty encouraged by the information
available at this point.
By conventional methods 60 to 75
million barrels could be recovered from
Mereenie, but nuclear stimulation
would produce significantly more.
Miniaturising a hydrogen 'bomb is ex-
pensive, so the cost must be exceeded
by the present value of additional oil
recoveries.
Should the detailed investigation of
the market for Amadeus hydrocarbon
in central and northern Australia con-

ASSOCIATION, SYDNEY
DUTIES:
Iri general to oversee and promote the activities of the Association. In particular,
to be responsible for:
the representation of the Association and its members in all industrial
matters;
the initiation and preparation of material for consideration by the
Council of the Association;
the implementation of the Council’s decisions;
the researching and development of statistics and other information
necessary to the achievement of the Association’s objectives;
close liaison with Government and other interest;

QUALIFICATIONS:
Applicants must have a high level of executive ability. While a University
Degree is preferable, it is not essential nor is experience in the industry.
Ability to confer at all levels of Governmental, industrial, and related com-
mercial spheres is required.
LOCATION:

CONDITIONS:
As the Association’s paramount consideration is the calibre of the appointee,
salary will be negotiated accordingly.
Superannuation and other benefits appropriate to this position will apply.

firm the preliminary findings, local
marketing of Mereenie petroleum pro-
ducts would generate revenue and pro-
vide well-performance data needed to
estimate Mereenie oil reserves, selecting
field spacing patterns and evaluating
various field exploitation techniques.
If Magellan goes ahead with the 80-
mile pipeline of Palm Valley gas to
Alice Springs, the Alice Springs muni-
cipality could use natural gas as energy
fuel for an electric generating plant.
The same transmission line could supply
natural gas to the satellite tracking
station (second largest in the world)
now under construction 14 miles from
Alice Springs. Industrial and agricul-
tural development could follow.
Magellan has commissioned a Texan
college to investigate the agricultural
potential of the Amadeus, working on
the assumption that development of
irrigated agriculture in the Northern
Territory would create markets for gas-
powered machinery, and create new
processing and industrial plants to
attract more settlers.
Another interesting facet of Magel-
lan’s activities is its mineral prospect-
ing, which is being expanded this year.
The company has concession areas, in-
cluding mineralised belts in the Pre-
cambrian Arunta complex north of the
Amadeus basin. The obvious deterrents
(in the past) to prospecting, remote
location, water shortages, and high
energy costs are considerably reduced
by the discovery of hydrocarbons
nearby. The company has just been
granted mineral rights to prospect near
Rum Jungle over a 942 square mile
area. Magellan Petroleum Australia also
has a 31J percent interest under a farm-
in in the Shark Bay potash prospect,
where two wells are about to be drilled.
A Caltex subsidiary drilled five
dry holes under farm-in in the Queens-
land permit area, so that this area is
not considered a great prospect, but
Ravensbourne, located 60 miles north-
east of Phillips’ Gilmore gas discovery
of 1964, at least has the benefit of
Caltex’s results. It is notable that
Magellan has discovered two fields
from eleven structures drilled, a high
wildcat success ratio even by U.S.
standards.
Its offshore permit areas in Gipps-
land cover five anomalies in 300 to
900 feet of water, which is deeper than
structures in adjacent Esso-BHP areas,
but not so much as to preclude drill-
ing. They are in the same geological
environment as the Halibut and King-
fish structures. The company is per-
forming marine seismic work to de-
fine drillable prospects. Its final in-
terest is exploration concessions in the
Otway sedimentary basin offshore.
Profiting by Esso-BHP’s experience,
Magellan will adopt the most sophis-
ticated methods of seismic testing and
interpretation, and the company plans
to treble its budgeted offshore expendi-
ture, and get cracking as soon as the
weather in Bass Strait permits.

EXPORT SPOTLIGHT
ON THE MAN-ON-THE-LAND
...‘The Law of the Minimum’ promises export ‘Bonus’
from dramatic increase in farm production
Ability to compete on world markets
depends on price and it is unfortunately
a fact that farm costs are rising far
more rapidly than returns. The farmer
is being caught in the shrinking margin
between cost and selling price.
Until now, increased acreage has been
regarded as the prime source of addi-
tional output. This has aggravated the
problem of shrinking margins because
it has involved additional fixed cost.
The answer is at farm level in using the
full available potential of water, soil
and plant growth capacity. To date, we
have only touched the fringe of the ex-
citing possibilities waiting to be tapped.
Imagine the advantages to be gained,
not only by the man-on-the-land, but
by the whole community if rural pro-
duction could be dramatically increased
—even doubled—without any signifi-
cant increase in overheads!
This startling proposition is being
turned into reality by the explosive
potential offered by a simple law of
plant growth called ‘The Law of the
Minimum.’
‘The Law of the Minimum’ states: ‘The
growth of plants is limited by the most
deficient plant nutrient element pre-
sent, all others being present in ade-
quate amounts.’
This means that even a bountiful sup-
ply of nutrients is wasted if one of them
is in short supply—the plant will only
progress to the maximum ‘ceiling of
performance’ set by the most deficient
element present in the soil.
The simple process of correcting soil
nutrients by supplementing those in
short supply allows full advantage to
be taken of all nutrient elements—the
sdfgsdfg

PROSPERITY
potential of all resources is then used
and yields are dramatically increased.
From an export point of view, this
‘bonus’ in yield promises a larger sur-
plus that can be offered at more attrac-
tive prices, being derived from existing
investment.
The process of correction may best be
undertaken by the application of chemi-
cal fertilizers containing the elements
vital to plant growth. The most
important of these are nitrogen, phos-
phorus, potassium and sulphur, because
these are required in large amounts.
Secondary and trace elements, notably
calcium, magnesium, molybdenum,
zinc, boron, are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and
pastures.

Tobacco growers in trouble
AUSTRALIA’S TOBACCO crop for
1967-68, now midway in its selling
season, was the smallest of any in the
four-year period of tjhe industry’s
stabilisation scheme, which runs its
course at the end of this year. The
crop, tentatively estimated at 23.5 mil-
lion pounds (green weight), will fall
a good deal short of the (26 million
pounds of local leaf per year) overall
marketing quota for the industry under
the scheme. As the tobacco and cigarette
manufacturers are committed not as
part of the scheme itself but as a
statutory requirement—to use 50 per-
cent (increased from percent at the
inception of the plan in 1965) Aus-
tralian leaf in their blends, presumably
the shortfall in the crop will mean some
erosion of stocks.
The stabilisation scheme was planned
on the expectation of 52.5 million
pounds (dry weight) of Australian leaf
a year, on average, over the duration
of the plan; but in the event the aver-
age yearly usage has fallen a million
or two pounds below this, and, with the
overall marketing quota being met by
the growers in most years, manufac-
turers’ stocks have necessarily increased
(they being the only buyers of the crop
at the auctions, though Victoria did sell
some tobacco leaf from over-quota
accumulated, stocks a couple of seasons
ago) at considerable expense to them.
The crop of 23.5 million pounds will
fall far short of the record of 34 million
pounds harvested in the 1964 season,
which, because it was well in excess of
sales possibilities, finally crystallised the
fitful effort going on since the disastrous
1961 season (when the Federal Govern-
ment gave growers $350,000 to relieve
distress) to get a stabilisation scheme.
The Queensland crop of just over 14
million pounds hasn’t in fact been much
different in weight to that of the
1966-67 season and, being of rather
higher grade than that one, fetched
better average prices, say an improve-
ment of some 5 to 6 cents a pound.
Nor was the crop in N.S.W., which
is the smallest-producing tobacco State,
much different from that of the previous
year, about 2.25 million pounds, mostly
from north coastal regions and some
from the Riverina irrigation areas. But
Victoria’s share of the 1967-68 Aus-
tralian tobacco crop can be estimated
at not much more than seven million
pounds, its lowest contribution to the
national total for many years, compar-
ing, say, with crops up to double that
level, such as that record 14.5
million pounds in 1964 (when N.S.W.
also cropped its record 17.2 million
pounds) and the next lowest this
decade of 6.5 million pounds in 1961-
62.
The sharp drop this last year in
Victoria is of course mainly attribu-
ted to 'the drought in the north-east
of the State, where production is con-
centrated in the valleys of (mainly)
the Ovens, King, and Kiewa Rivers
and with the trend toward the higher
reaches of the valleys. Drought was
the real reaper of the tobacco crop in
those parts (where there are close on
400 individual growers), bu't there were
other contributory causes to the drop,
including the effects of the 1966
floods, which entailed much good to-
bacco land necessarily being put to
other crops for 18 months or so; and,
in the early stages of the 1967-68
growing season, severe frosts followed
by yellow dwarf disease (carried by
flying jassids insects) which invaded
the valleys, wiping out many first to-
bacco plantings.
The net result is that not only is
the yield per acre down to around
9001 b. (compared with an average of
12001 b. an acre in 1966) but the aver-
age quality is much lower. Indeed,
more tobacco than usual is likely to
fail to satisfy the Australian Tobacco
Board’s standards for tobacco that can
be submitted at auction. These stan-
dards were raised in the second year
of the stabilisation scheme, and with
the marketable quota for each State
and also Australia unchanged at
26 million pounds the average
minimum price evened out over the
various grades offered was increased
from the original 104 cents to 109.4
cents a pound to compensate growers
for having to drop the lowest grade
tobacco from their offerings.
Whichever way one looks at it, Vic-
torian tobacco growers are going to
suffer a big loss in incomes in the cur-
rent year despite the stabilisation plan.
The situation may, indeed, call for
similar relief measures for the Vic-
torian growers to those of 1961. The
stabilisation scheme doesn’t possess a
fund of its own from which to help
them; indeed, Victorian growers may
well be thinking that more teeth
should be put into stabilisation when
its future shortly comes up for con-
sideration.

THE VETERINARY Association con-

confers resistance against virulent dis-
temper as early as eight hours after
vaccination and lasts for two months.
The distemper vaccines currently in
use do not work nearly as quickly.
This finding is of broader significance
because rinderpest in cattle is caused
by a virus belonging to the same group
responsible for distemper in dogs.
Visiting American veterinarians men-
tioned a novel means of conquering
chronic skin conditions which develop
in animals that are highly sensitive to
fleas. They used the principle of set-
ting a thief to catch a thief. They have
found a chemical in the saliva of fleas
which when injected into dogs and cats
tends to desensitise them. A course of
three or four injections at weekly in-
tervals relieves the extreme irritation
and itchiness suffered 'by about three-
quarters of these animals for the next
five to six weeks. When the itchiness
returns, one or two booster doses will
restore the animal’s resistance and
enable it to live in peace, growing a
coat sleek enough for the show ring.

of infested dogs has been greatly re-
duced, but others have turned in dis-
appointing figures. The State average,
however, has shown an impressive de-
cline. At the outset of 'the campaign
11 percent of all dogs were infested,
while now only about 2 percent, are
carriers. Ultimate eradication will prob-
ably demand a system of quarantine,
restricting infested dogs to their home
properties. At the moment the Depart-
ment recommends the legal prohibition
of the feeding of offal, even when
boiled, and special facilities on farms
where home killing of meat is practised
to exclude dogs completely from the
killing and drainage area.
Iceland has maintained a suppression
policy for 100 years and the incidence
of hydatids in that country is now
insignificant. For the eight years ending
June, 1967, Tasmania had 124 fatal
cases of hydatid disease. This is a shock-
ingly high rate, probably unequalled
anywhere else in the world. Beware
of the dog!
And on cats: Dr. N. C. Palmer,
Veterinary Faculty, University of Mel-
bourne, noted that many people harm
the health of young cats and dogs by
pampering them with a rich diet of
meat. Thus, the incidence of abnormal
bone growth caused by the excessive
consumption of meat is remarkably
high.
The condition is technically known
as osteodystrophia fibrosa. The first
signs, which usually appear some weeks
after the kittens are weaned on to a
meat diet, are lameness in one or more
legs, followed by backache, semi-
paralysis, and various skeletal abnor-
malities. While these deformities are de-
veloping, behavioural aberrations may
be observed, previously playful kittens
commonly becoming irritable. They
begin to lie continuously, and finally
they cannot stand.
Mealt-eating creates a dietary im-
balance in their intake of calcium and
phosphorus, which for healthy growth
should be in the ratio of 1:1. Meat con-
tains 20 times as much phosphorus as
calcium, and so a diet heavy on meat
can soon displace this critical ratio.
Dr. Palmer says to mix l-60th oz. of
calcium carbonate (lime) to every 3oz.
. of meat. Alternatively, canned-fish pet
rations contain bones and hence supply
sufficient calcium for growing cats.
Dr. A. A. Seawright and Co., Veter-
inary School, University of Queensland,
said that many cat keepers choose raw
liver for their pets. On this diet the cats
get excessive quantities of vitamin A
(the addition of milk to the diet
aggravates the trouble). Since the vita-
min build-up is progressive, this nutri-
tional disease is seen in mature rather
than young cats. It also leads to skeletal
damage preceded by tooth decay and
discoloration. Sores in the mouth are
sometimes seen, and internal organs,
especially the liver, lungs, spleen, and
kidneys, are adversely affected.


Waiting for Dr.Coombs
ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
THE ESTABLISHMENT by the
Federal Government of a nine-member
Australian Council for the Arts has
revived many of the national cultural
hopes and ambitions which were born
with the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
and became atrophied with it.
Before the council meets, and before
the applicants for its aid begin
queuing, The Bulletin, here, pub-
lishes a variety of its critics’ opinions
on how the council can best help the
Arts:
MUSIC
WHAT THE new Arts Council can do
is to see that worthwhile musical ven-
tures are supported. Far too many
trail-blazing performances in this coun-
try have resulted in a financial loss,
and no dedication, however altruistic,
can go on sustaining this type of blow.
Recently a chamber orchestra was
formed which was no scratch band but
was composed of the best freelance
players in Sydney. This group survived
one month and disbanded in despair.
It is all very well to say that such
debacles are the result of impractical
and woolly minded planning, but all
the precise planning in the world can-
not alter the bleak future which faces
such a project without financial aid.
Although the lot of young composers
has improved considerably over the past
decade or so, with even commerical
enterprise lashing out with a bit of
money in their direction, their creative
function must remain a sparetime activ-
ity. Alfred Hill' had more commercial
success than any other Australasian
composer, excluding the expatriates
Percy Grainger, Arthur Benjamin, and
possibly Malcolm Williamson, but he
admitted that he never made enough at
it to keep him in cigars. Composers of
real significance, like Raymond Hanson,
cannot have made enough to keep them
in matches. The idea of a “composer in
residence” is good, and no university in
Australia should be without one, but
some composers, like Hanson, work
better stuck out in the bush somewhere
with, or without, a piano. Surely the
Council should be able to provide
creative musicians with a couple of
years free from financial worries, and
also ensure safeguards against any
victimisation or loss of privileges result-
ing from their absence from normal
jobs during this period.
OPERA AND BALLET
IT IS unfortunate that musicians,
singers, and dancers expect to be paid
a decent week’s wage nowadays, but the
fact remains that it is no longer pos-
sible to produce opera or ballet at a
profit; only the size of the deficit is of
interest to the new Council for the
Arts.
By far the greatest part of the
Trust’s annual expenditure has been
on opera and ballet. Whether this is as
it should be or not, the money used
comes out of the pockets of the man
in the street and should produce re-
sults commensurate with the benefits
it brings to the community.
Financial success at the box office
during the past two years is unfor-
tunately not the right yardstick; it was
largely due to the decision to spend
money on proper promotion. Neverthe-
less it shows that a public does exist
for these two expensive arts and, until
the straight theatre finds a way of pro-
moting itself in turn, one must assume
that as large a public does not exist
for what is here the minor art form, but
Barry Jones and Geoffrey Dutton, two
of the nine members of the Council
for the Arts. Others at right
in all other countries the major. The
Council for the Arts will have a dif-
ficult task in deciding whether to allo-
cate funds to opera and ballet (large
audience and large deficits) or drama
(smaller audiences and smaller deficits).
Is it better to subsidise 169,455 city
opera patrons at $4.03 per seat or
124,027 city theatre patrons at $1.04
per seat? (The figures are based on the
Trust’s 1967 annual report.)
Of greater importance is whether the
Council should be allowed to interfere
in the internal running of the Trust’s
two companies. While this is a
dangerous and undesirable practice, it
is equally undesirable to subsidise any
organisation which may misuse the
funds put at its disposal. It is essential
that financial provisions should be made
several years in advance; no opera com-
pany can expect to engage the right
artists less than two years ahead.
The Trust’s ballet company has
achieved international standing. The
opera company has also gained many
credits over the years, mainly through
native talent. Its failures are man-
agerial: planning operas which cannot
be cast properly, poor productions,
abysmal scenic designs, engaging singers
for other than artistic reasons, and so
on.
REGIONAL THEATRE
THE FORMATION of the National
Council for the Arts is a cautiously
hesitant bureaucratic step in a gener-
ally meaningful direction. Its initial
budget will be small, it will not have a
full-time director, and even its office
staff may have to be borrowed from
some Federal department. Still, at Fed-
eral Government level, a committee
devoting its time to cultural matters is
an important advance.
One matter on which the council will
Dr. H. C.
Coombs
Miss Betty
Archdale
Mr. Peter Cole-
man, MLA
no doubt advise the Government will
concern the provision of effective theatre
outside the larger State capitals. If
Mr. Gorton were a de Gaulle and Dr.
Coombs a Malraux, the answer would
be simple: regional cultural centres
designed by outstanding young architects,
containing theatres, libraries, and gal-
leries. Under full subsidy, theatre com-
panies would then present an exciting
modern and classic repertoire, and the
public, quite fascinated by the scale and
bravura of the utopian scheme, would
turn up in thousands.
This is happening in France at the
moment, in the provinces, where Mal-
raux felt the cultural delights of Paris
did not penetrate sufficiently. As we all
know, things are a bit different in
Australia.
When it comes to wondering what
the council could do about theatre in
the smaller regional centres, the only


sensible scheme which comes to mind is
one tied to Mr. Stefan Haag’s State
Theatre plan of some years ago. In
this, each State capital was to have its
own theatre company, performing
seasons of sufficient duration 'to make
playgoing as regular, ordinary, and easy,
as going to the cinema is.
Mr. Haag’s plan never really got out
of the office. Sydney’s Old Tote and
The Melbourne Theatre Company have
received their modest grants gratefully,
but they have not gained broadly based
public support.
Clearly what is needed to make such
a scheme work is sufficient funds. By
world standards it would not at all be
an ambitious plan, but it would cer-
tainly provide the kind of widespread
theatrical activity Australia needs if
ever its cultural pretensions are to be
justified.
THEATRE
THE DRAMATIC theatre must be the
council’s first priority. Instead of the
fragmentary encouragement randomly
scattered by the Elizabethan Trust (all
those little amounts so brazenly equated
with responsibility in so many of the
Trust’s annual reports) , the council must
invest its money and faith in a purpose-
ful, meaningful whole: a national
theatre. It is time to stop indulging
rural and suburban plaintivities with
public funds for self-indulgent projects;
too much time has been wasted and too
mudh money frittered on a grass-roots
policy that has cultivated no more than
a row of theatrical back gardens all
carefully and jealously fenced off.
Unlike ballet, opera, music, or paint-
ing, theatre in Australia is nowhere
representatively Australian; it has no
national touchstone, no central
dynamism and no indigenous character
—unless one counts its constant and
various noises of discontent. Theatre
needs a corporate heart, a national
theatre pattern. Someone has to be bold
enough to forget the failure of Hugh
Hunt’s Trust Players and not for ever
be intimidated into thinking of that ven-
ture as the beginning and end of an
Australian national theatre. With the
money it’s about to inherit and the
influence it can wield, the Council for
the Arts must encourage the large ideal.
The thinking and planning needs to
be locally original. The thinking can
start with the premise that Australia
needs a national theatre to put more
than parochial purpose into the best
of the products of Sydney and Mel-
bourne; the planning can start by sub-
sidising not one base but two. Mel-
bourne and Sydney are the Australian
theatre capitals, they can share fhe
responsibility.
National subsidy need not necessarily
mean the sacrifice of local autonomy,
but there will be a need for selflessness
on the local level. The Melbourne
Theatre Company obviously suggests
itself as one arm of an Australian
national theatre, and just as obviously
it should have its national home in the
Melbourne Cultural Centre. The Old
Tote Theatre Company is Sydney’s
most apparent national arm, with head-
quarters in the drama theatre of the
Opera House (a theatre virtually beg-
ging for tenants, according to architect
Peter Hall.) If the OTC is unwilling
to leave the maternalistic University oi
New South Wales complex, or is
reluctant to think of home as anywhere
but the timber theatre it plans to build,
then it should be prepared to have its
resources and personnel plundered and
its role subordinated by a nationally
oriented company performing in the
Opera House.
Adequately financed, a double-based
national theatre system could support
permanent repertories, exchange pro-
grams and touring companies, and
more effectively serve the nation than all
the present splintered activity is doing.
FILM AND TELEVISION
IF DR. COOMBS has had bother with
ballet and difficulties with dramas he’s
liable to get hopelessly tangled in film.
From the training of talent to the dis-
tribution of product, the medium has
many serious problems which will be
hard to get clearly in focus, let alone
fix.
For example, the council will need
to consider the training of directors,
writers, and cameramen. Britain has
long had specialist institutes and col-
leges running parallel with the industry,
but a recent Government commission
found them wanting, and recommended
that a National Film School be estab-
lished as a matter of urgency. Moves
are already afoot in Victoria for such
a school, but the plans are being
strongly opposed by those who believe
that film education should be inclined
toward production for television rather
than features — a clearly crucial dis-
tinction.
The council will be expected to press
for a Film Bank to give low-interest
loans to promising feature projects,
although the feature industry seems to
be reviving of its own accord.
The council certainly will need to
support current moves to establish a
Canadian-style National Film Board
and must lend its weight to the
attempts of the Commonwealth Film
Unit .to free itself from its ministerial
yoke.
And it will have to try to do all
these things without creating a new
and inhibiting bureaucracy. As Dr.
Coombs has already shown traits of
being cultural commissar, that might
be the hardest job of all.
THE ARTS
SO FAR there seems reason for ’mild
optimism, in the membership of the
council, bearing in mind that the Prime
Minister’s Department was finding a
committee of men and women, not
auditioning for a choir of angels. It is
not the people, but the kind of people
chosen. They are, in the main, a world
away from the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust committee, whose contribution to
the Arts was mainly to ooze self-
importantly into the front row of the
dress circle on first nights.
The new council seems to belie the
idea (and Lord knows there has been
evidence enough until now to sustain it)
that the chairman, Dr. Coombs, likes to
be surrounded by nonentities. There is
some piquancy in the fact that one
member has a TV program, another
edits a magazine, and Mr. Geoffrey
Dutton, with bis printing press, is our
closest thing to an eighteenth century
pamphleteer. Coombs wanted to
make sure that any major disruptions in
the council are made public he could
hardly have done better.
So far, perhaps, so good. But the
difficulties ahead in national sponsor-
ship of the Arts are formidable. It may
be good to choose people for the council
who touch life at several points but
they are invariably busy. The most
effective, and since artists are people,
too, sympathetic, lines of communica-
tion must be opened.
The great priority is drama. This,
where big decisions must be made.
Another priority, linked to dra’ma, is
films. The council should poke its nose
in enough to become conversant with
all aspects of filming (with no nonsense
about “educational”; all films are, in
some sense, educational), even if it
cannot move into major underwriting
for some time, or ever. The council
is surely not to be 'merely a dispenser
of funds but a body capable of advis-
ing the Prime Minister’s Department on
how finance can be organised.
Before leaving the performing arts
there would be long-term public bene-
fit in a thorough look into music and
the advantages and disadvantages, both
to other music-makers and the ABC,
in having the national television and
radio organisation in control of major
instrumental 'music-making.
An advantage of non-practitioners on
the council is that they may think to
some extent like a consumers’ body.
The council is not just to hand out
lots of lovely lolly to artistic aspirants.
It is to subsidise audiences to give them
a chance to get what they want at a
price they can pay.
The non-practitioners on the council
will also probably be better than artists
at meshing the arts with the rest of
our life, making clear that a country
which cannot e’mploy its artists is under-
developed, even backward, no matter
how many iron-ore mountains are
shipped off to Japan.

THE FACT that appreciation of art ultimately is a matter
of personal taste probably is most clearly demonstrated
in public attitudes toward paintings. When people translate
their personal taste for a painting into a cash purchase,
the painting almost invariably goes into a private home
to satisfy the aestheticism of its owner or, sometimes,
merely to enhance interior decoration. In Sydney, where
the art market is buoyant, ownership of paintings is also
a matter of prestige and useful investment, and the
precious private collections scattered throughout the city
and suburbs are seldom, if ever, seen publicly.
But this week some 60 owners of valuable paintings
are exhibiting not only their taste in art but something
of their private collections an uncommon occurrence
at a time when ownership of high-priced works of art is
not something that is willingly publicised.
Members of the Black and White Committee have
loaned paintings that usually hang on the walls of their
Eastern Suburbs homes for a two-day fund-raising exhibi-
tion to aid the N.S.W. Royal Blind Society. This collection
of “their favorite paintings,” showing at the Barry Stern
Galleries, Paddington, is being insured for $lOO,OOO and
will be protected by security guards. The Committee
expects to boost its funds by $lOOO with a private viewing
and champagne cocktail party on Friday, June 28, and
the galleries are open to the public the following day.
Many of the paintings in this exhibition have never been
displayed publicly before and include works by Russell
Drysdale, Sidney Nolan, Clifton Pugh, John Olsen, Sali
Herman, John Perceval, and Judy Cassab.

The way back
By REX CRAMPHORNE
The Glass Menagerie. Tennessee
Williams, Rillara Community
Theatre.
ON THE SCALE of what I’ve come to
expect from theatre, this production
rates badly. On the scale of what I’d
like from theatre—it’s going in the
opposite direction. If I were to develop
the first of these statements, I should be
involved in discussion of an uninspired
presentation of a difficult, but reward-
ing, play. To do this I should have to
ignore the second statement, and I’m
afraid that is not really possible no
amount of concentration on the specific
faults (or virtues) of this production
will help me to overlook the fact that I
disapprove of what it stands for. Let me
try to state first what I think what it
stands for, and then why I think it is
wrong.
As fairly as I can make out, the
Killara Community Theatre aims to
entertain a local audience. For tlhis
purpose a company of actors (including
three who are as good as any in Syd-
ney) present well-known plays for a
three-week season, rehearsing the next
play during the day. The auditorium is
better, the stage no worse, than most;
audiences applaud what is offered them.
Assuming, then, that this local audience
is entertained, we can only hope, for
the sake of the company, that it
develops the habit of coming back for
more of the same.
Unfortunately, it seems to me that
other media have theatre beaten
hollow for this sort of entertainment,
and I venture to suggest -that such an
audience as came, in curiosity, to be
entertained by an unfamiliar medium,
will soon return to television and the
Chatswood Roxy: the novelty of “real”
actors can prove more embarrassing
than exciting to such an audience.
Having no previous experience of the
style, it is hardly likely to be sym-
pathetic to the shortcomings of reper-
tory theatre.
Surely, rather than attempt to estab-
lish a theatre from an alien past, it
would be better to look forward. On
the most fundamental level, it is now
generally taken for granted that a play
needs to be directed. The repertory-
style director, who decided where the
sofa would go, belongs back with actor-
managers and the sort of theatrical
organisation where the main actor
stood in the middle and arranged the
others in a semi-circle around himself.
This is not to raise questions of “art”
—it requires considerable talent and skill
to convert actors plus text into some-
thing with any readily graspable mean-
ing. How many people can even have
got sense out of “Misalliance” (the
previous production at Killara), let
alone entertainment?
It would be sensible to look for some-
thing that theatre can do in the way of
entertaining that other media cannot.
Surely by concentration on the “com-
munity” nature of the experience—by
deciding to choose plays and methods
of presentation which emphasise the
connection between real actors and real
audience —by first saying something and,
second, saying something which has
specific meaning for the audience seeing
and hearing it —you are doing what no
oKer medium can do as vividly, and
laying claim to being more in the com-
munity than a tolerated curiosity.
Solo laughter
By PHILLIP ADAMS
In the Marks Manner, Princess Theatre,
Melbourne.
HASTILY prepared in the aftermath of
“Spring and Port Wine” and presented
in a theatre growing strangely chill as
a result of its infrequent use, this one-
man show promised to be a disaster.
Instead it proved to be thoroughly de-
lightful, making me feel nostalgic for a
type of theatre I can’t remember.
Alfred Marks sits on a stool and
fiddles with his microphone in the
current Shelley Berman fashion. But
that doesn’t disguise the fact that his
talent derives from older, more tradi-
tional idioms. He tells Cockney jokes,
Jewish jokes, Gentile jokes, and blue
jokes. He sings “Some Enchanted
Evening,” “My Old Dutch,” and an
aria from “The Barber of Seville.”
And while there’s not much fire in
Marks’ performance there’s a lovely
glow from his coals. A typical Marks’
joke: “Do you talk to your wife when
you’re making love?”—“Yes, if there’s
a phone handy.”
He must have told a hundred such
in his two-hour stint, and the worse
they were the funnier he made them.
The only time he lost me was when he
allowed his accompanist to play a
clamorous all-thumbs version of
“Ritual Fire Dance.”

The Richard Madigan Collection of
Contemporary American Painting.
Blaxland Galleries, Sydney.
NO WONDER Clement Greenberg
had to adopt the term “modernist paint-
ing” to describe certain features of
modern art since Monet, when the use
of “conte'mporary” has become so
debased and so inclusive as to need re-
definition every time it’s used signifi-
cantly. It’s difficult to see in what sense
some of the works by eight Americans
at the Blaxland are contemporary when
they are mere exercises in the superfici-
ally obvious features of the contem-
porary mode; minor ritual performances
by casual converts, as it were. As Pat-
rick McCaughey noted last week of
Louis Ja’mes, now at the South Yarra
Gallery, artists don’t need to go con-
stantly after masterpieces, and as Eliot
said of Pound, “Those who expect that
any good poet should proceed by turn-
ing out a series of masterpieces . . v
are simply ignorant of the conditions
under which a poet must work . . .
The poet who wishes to continue to
write poetry must keep in training.”'
Yet, those who don’t have master-
piece ambitions need a skill lacking in
most of these Americans who, co’mpared
with the masters of last year’s Two
Decades of American Painting, are so
derivative, dependent, and parasitical
that they do not have that air of in-
evitable rightness found in the most
occasional of minor painters, like
Utrillo or Augustus Egg. Parodies of
modern art have teeth; parasites
snuggle up for comfort. For example,
John Davis 'makes elegant variations on
Stella’s shaped canvases and William
Walton’s four canvases of a circle with
a cross, each called Hex Sign, cast no
more spells than a nursery rhyme.
Mario Yrisarry’s wavering lines, like
black walls of China in the snow, are
rather decorous; William Kienbusch’s
blue action painting shows how action
painting’s anxiety was tranquillised into
a flurry of pleasant excitement, and
John Hartell has reduced the acidity
and vibration of abstract impressionism
to a vaporised mother-of-pearl, sweet
and insipid. Perle Fine and Jack Perl-
mutter save the show.

Courageous
By KENNETH ROBINS
SIR ARTHUR Quiller Couch’s
“Essays in Literature” has the follow-
ing dialogue: “Ah, sir,” said the lady,
“this is a sad, degenerate age!” “Ah,
madam,” answered the philosopher, “let
us thank heaven that neither you nor I
belong to it!”
I detected at least two folk at the
recital by the Arthur Leech String
Quartet at the Cell Block who also did
not belong, and there were moments
when I had a sinking feeling that I
could not -be said to be with it, either.
There were three quartets on the pro-
gram by Tom de Leeuw, Krzysztof
Penderecki and Witold Lutoslawski, the
last receiving its first Australian per-
formance.
Each work contained stretches which
achieved a strange, almost unearthly,


beauty but one had the feeling that the
majority of the sounds could and should
have Been produced by other means,
and the miracle created by the crafts-
men of Cremona was largely redund-
ant. G and C strings were loosened off
until they vibrated with the frequency
of sick slugs, indeterminate whistles and
squeaks were prised from the half-inch
of string between the adjuster and the
bridge, and the bows of the players
will undoubtedly need respraying be-
fore they need rehairing.
One can have nothing but praise for
the courage and enterprise of the play-
ers; there is so much in this music that
depends on the individual performers
to give it significance that they are
almost in the position of a jazz man
when his solo comes up. Very few of
the audience are likely to be able to
cut through the crimes of the per-
former to the music as the composer
envisaged it, so it is the sole respon-
sibility of the players to bring it off.
At this concert they rose to the chal-
lenge splendidly. Many hours must be
spent with music like this before it
assumes coherence in your own mind,
but to transmit it coherently constitutes
a major achievement.
On the whole the works were reason-
ably taut but with'the exception of the
impressive Lutoslawski there were times
when the basic material was not strong
enough to sustain interest throughout,
hardly a unique fault, for on occasions
even Beethoven did not know when to
stop.
Barry Conyngham’s String Trio also
had its first airing at this concert and
this young man had the grace to allow
the instruments to sing. I must say that
I found more warmth in this piece than
in any of the others, and if the pro-
ducts of the Sydney school can bring
good old-fashioned human feeling into
their music, bully for them.

and journalism in cinema have disin-
tegrated. The feature director bor-
rows increasingly from documentary to
achieve greater urgency and impact,
while there could hardly have been
more art in the Melbourne Film Festi-
val’s best documentaries. Sometimes, as
Satyajit Ray pointed out at a work-
shop session, documentaries are almost
too powerful, raising the question of
ethics not merely on grounds of in-
vasion of privacy, but because many
apparently authentic human docu-
ments are, in effect, partial forgeries.
lan Dunlop, the director of the ethno-
graphic study “Desert People,” con-
ceded ground here, admitting that the
camera inevitably violates its subject’s
natural environment. But, with in-
tegrity, what had to be staged could,
he hoped, accurately reflect what could
no longer be spontaneous.
“The Things I Cannot Change,”
from Canada (unquestionably the
world’s finest documentary makers),
made “Ca:hy Come Home” look like
the “Donna Reed Show.” Filmed over
a three-week period in a destitute Mon-
treal home, the crew captured crisis
after crisis in the life of the Baileys
and their many children. The camera
was openly involved to the extent that
Mr. Bailey, an emotional and ex-
trcver.ed man, spoke directly into the
lens, wholeheartedly co-operating in the
exercise. There was little that smacked
of contrivance in this film, yet there
were movements when the camera
clearly influenced the outcome of
events.
Of course, moral niceties hardly arise
when the subject revels in the camera
as it bobs about him. Thus, one could
only delight in Canada’s caustic, but
exuberant portrait of Lord Thompson
of Fleet, because Lord Thompson so
obviously delighted in hamming up
his public image. The biggest, baddest
Press baron of the'm all roared
obligingly at his obsequious staff and
played ringmaster while prime min-
isters and diplomats performed.
He gleefully co-operated in sequences
designed to highlight his meanness,
ruthlessness, and rudeness, reducing
Marshall McLuhan to the rack of pre-
tentious undergraduate and emphatic-
ally refusing a copper to some poignant
buskers. (His $3OO million- fortune
didn’t prevent hi’m from buying his
bathing-suit at a bargain sale, and when
being fitted in ermine robes for a Court
investiture, he insisted on a generous
hem. “They’ll have to do for my grand-
sons,” he growled.)
Ray’s ethical questioning was relevant
to “Warrandale,” Canada’s study of a
clinic employing a radical and contro-
versial technique of physical contain-
ment for its emotionally disturbed
children. The argument goes that, as
the children lack ego control, it is
necessary to impose external control, to
give them confidence. This usually
meant violent wrestling matches, com-
plete with obscene shriekings. There’s no
question as to the integrity of Warran-
dale’s staff; they’re obviously devoted
and loving people. But is it right to
involve a camera crew in the lives of
such seriously disturbed children?
Communicating
ORATORY v. FACTS
JUDGED as a TV performance in
which democracy is seen to be at work
(even if stage managed), Prime Min-
ister Gorton’s address to the National
Press Club last week was a valid and
effective exercise in Govern'ment public
relations. With Mr. Gorton appearing
to take the nation into his confidence
before reporting to Cabinet on his Asian
tour, and members of the Press lobbing
their questions with intelligent civility
instead of the disorder and subservience
which often characterises such public
confrontations, the telecast had a certain
fascination, even if all the facts it
offered were not immediately compre-
hensible.
There’s much to be said in favor of
politicians meeting the Press on tele-
vision, but there’s no substitute for the
printed word for an objective under-
standing of the facts behind the oratory.
Mr. Gorton appears to have acquired a
measured, oratorical manner since his
folksy appearances on TV during and
immediately after the stampede for the
Prime Ministership, and while he is
still advantaged by a comfortable TV
presence, there was, last week, a slight
disadvantage in his inability to present
facts and opinions without actor-like
gestures and speech rhythms. His
detailed itemisation of the defence
build-up thus became an example of
twords without immediate meaning.
GETTING TOGETHER
THE reporter at last week’s National
Press Club luncheon who expressed a
slight bewilderment over the value of
the just-signed cultural agreement
between Australia and Indonesia, prob-
ably spoke for most people in the
two countries, despite Prime Minister
Gorton’s prickled defence of it on
idealistic grounds.
Such agreements don’t have the im-
pact or drama as such things as non-
aggression pacts, defence treaties, and
trade alliances, and culture is, after all
. . . well, Culture. But at a time of
major and minor antagonisms between
countries there is something warmly
sane about two neighboring countries
deciding to get to know each other
better. And that, basically, is what the
Australian-Indonesian Cultural Agree-
ment is all about.
Its twelve articles agree to closer
co-operation in education, the arts,
science, and sport. The most fundamen-
tal article is the first: “The two
Governments shall foster the teaching
in educational institutions and elsewhere
of the Indonesian language in Australia
and of the English language in Indo-
nesia.” The most immediately promising
is the tenth: “The two Governments
shall encourage visits between the two
countries by individuals and representa-
tive groups in various fields of social,
scientific, cultural, and sporting activity,
and shall facilitate visits by tourists.” .

LANG, MENZIES, AND
THE GOVERNOR
VERSUS THE REST
By PETER COLEMAN
Dismissal of a Premier. (The Philip
Game Papers). Bethia Foott. Morgan
Publications. $3.95.
EACH NEW book on Mr. Lang seems
calculated to show that Lang Was
Right after all. A couple of years ago
in his fascinating “Rallying Point,” even
Eric Campbell leader of the New
Guard, that folk product of Sydney’s
North Shore which won the support
of a range of people from “Banjo”
Paterson, Smithy, and Ulm to, accord-
ing to Campbell, Sir Isaac Isaacs and
the King—distinguished Lang from his
Red followers and shared with Lang a
detestation of Sir Otto Niemeyer and
the Big Business deflationists. Now we
have “The Philip Game Papers,” or as
many of his and his wife’s letters as
Bethia Foott has been able to collect,
and it comes as no surprise that the
Governor thought Lang was, if not
completely “Right,” then had “a great
deal of right on his side.”
Lang’s misfortune was to have been
ahead of his time in economic policy
and just too late for his time in his
States’ Rights policy: if New South
Wales had still had the independent
power that Premier Dibbs had had
during the 1890 s Depression—and Lang
seems to have taken Dibbs as a model
as far as he had any at all —he might
have been able to carry out some of
his program. But, meanwhile, the
detestable Commonwealth had been
created—Lang even confesses he worked
for Federation, the basic mistake for
Langism—and had created an even
more detestable Commonwealth Bank
and persuaded the States to create the
ultimately detestable Loan Council
(which Lang refused to attend, but to
no avail). And the anti-Lang Federal
Labor Government was committed to
the deflationary policy which delayed
economic recovery and prolonged the
suffering.
But although Governor Game’s sym-
pathy with much of Langism comes as
no surprise, the book does fill out our
knowledge of the attitude of the
Governor’s circle and of High Con-
servative pressures on him —just as Eric
Campbell’s book filled out our knowledge
of the more populist New Guard.
Sir Philip Game emerges as a sym-
pathetic, dignified, thoughtful Governor.
Suffering from terrible headaches and
insomnia, tormented by self-doubt,
shocked by the conditions of the un-
employed sleeping in the Botanic Gar-
dens, returning 25 percent of his annual
salary to the State Treasury, lacking
confidence in any of the alternatives to
Lang’s party —the Federal Laborites, the
New South Wales Nationalists, or New
South Wales’ Country Parity—he, and
his wife, had to put up with months of
insulting letters, social snubs, and worth-
less contemptuous advice from
reactionary lawyers, academics, graziers,
bankers, physicians, to the effect that he
should dismiss Lang at once despite
Lang’s electoral mandate and his
opponents’ messy divisions.
Attacks ranged from “Bulletin” car-
toons of him as Pontius Pilate or re-
quests to be removed from his invitation
lists to more direct personal insults: a
socially prominent lady turning her back
on Lady Game as she walked up to
greet her (“It took all her resolution
to fight back tears”), or a Sydney gentle-
man over coffee after a private dinner
remarking, “I notice you no longer drink
the King’s health at dinner” (“It re-
quired the greatest restraint to ignore
the effrontery”). Interestingly, a Mr.
Robert Menzies, MLA, from Victoria,
supported the Governor’s stand against
the anti-Lang extremists. At the same
time the Governor liked Lang and liked
talking to him: often it was only by
stroking his big red retriever that he
could break Lang’s spell in these con-
versations.
In the end, when he did dismiss
Sir Philip at Lightning Ridge
Lang, he was still unsure whether he
was playing into Lang’s hands, since
Lang was confident he would win the
following election. He lost and “my
assassin’s stroke,” as Sir Philip called
it, was, to that extent at least, vin-
dicated. Lang was also now off the
hook and in due course began his new
campaign to purge his Party of the
Communists who had so clearly in-
filtrated it in the crisis.
Bethia Foott (daughter of Brigadier-
General A. T. Anderson, the Gov-
ernor’s private secretary) has been un-
able to locate some of the letters be-
tween Lang and the Governor in the
crucial weeks and the originals have
mysteriously disappeared from the files
of the Premier’s Department. For-
tunately Lang tabled many of them
at the time and Lady Game had kept
copies of others. Nor has she had access
to official cables and Dominion Office
records, and obviously London must
have had an influential say, one way
or the other. Despite this it remains
an essential book—not only for its
account of the politics of the period
but for the lighter episodes such as the
opening of the Harbor Bridge in high
summer, with nine speeches. (I like
the picture of Lang muttering angrily
to his friend Governor Game about the
Governor-General’s arrival: “It’s our
show, not his. It’s a State thing.”)
One last point: the book is published
by Morgan Publications, that is, by Mr.
Alec Shepherd, an amateur publisher.
Apparently the manuscript was offered
to and turned down by several major
publishers. It is now a best-seller. Mr.
Shepherd deserves congratulations, but
one wonders again just why our pub-
lishers so often go wrong with obviously
irresistible manuscripts.
KEATS ' FEATS
By BARBARA HOLLOWAY
The Major Poems of John Keats. Nor-
man Talbot. Sydney University
Press. $2.75.
TALBOT’S STUDY of Keats is the
fourth of the Sydney Studies in
Literature series. Mr. Talbot is a
lecturer in English at the University of
Newcastle, as well as a poet in his own
right. The book’s brevity prevents his
developing his own views at any length,
and imposes its readers’ upon it, for it
is necessarily a brief introduction to
Keats, and as such is also an admirable
study for secondary-school or university
students. Talbot’s pleasantly informal
style makes it highly readable, and the
organisation of the book is usefully
straightforward. In three sections, the
book contains a general consideration of
the nature of Romanticism, perhaps the
most interesting chapter; a detailed
examination of Keats’ major poems,
and in the final chapter there is a
brief survey of the body of critical
work on Keats and the Romantics.
Both Keats and his readers are done
a considerable service in “Romanticism
and Keats,” for Keats’ continual popu-
larity and the decline of enthusiasm for
his contemporaries, has led to a tend-
ency to regard him as quite separate
from the developments which dictated
the nature of his poetry as much as
Wordsworth’s or Shelley’s were dic-
tated. Talbot repairs this situation by
showing most convincingly that Kealts
was not only influenced by bis con-
temporaries and predecessors but is as
much a part of the English poetic
tradition as they are. He provides a
rough scaffolding of dates about which


to build his evidence, but his account of
the development from Pope to Words-
worth is much more interesting than
such accounts usually are. He cites the
theory that a certain type of experience
can only be satisfactorily expressed in
a particular form; for example, Pope
is a brilliant poet because his experi-
ence could be adequately expressed in
the forms he had to work wi.h. Talbot
suggests that the mental disturbances
of Gray, Collins, Cowper, and Smart
were the result of social disorder:
“The keystones of the Augustan
social ethic had been Reason and Rule
(or decorum), but they had sadly fallen
to be the props of a grotesque sham
of dishonesty and gentility.”
The Hanoverian poets were either
distressed by the attempt to force their
experience into Augustan terms, which
were simply unsuitable, or found the
accepted forms inadequate for the
expression of their “emotional tumults.”
Blake may have transcended these
problems, but by lesser figures, the
revolution, which found its first public
utterance in the “Lyrical Ballads,” was,
as Talbot says, “desperately needed.”
Talbot divides Romantic poetry into
poetry of vision, which creates its own
imaginary world in myth, as in Blake’s
“Prophetic Books,” and poetry of
experience, which is based on the
ordinary world and would include most
of Wordsworth’s work. This distinction
is particularly useful in considering
Keats’ poetry, for it emphasises his
ability to create both worlds in a way
that no other Romantic could. The
concern in this study, however, is almost
entirely with the social and political
views of Blake, Wordsworth, and, of
course, Keats. Such a concern is less
rewarding with Keats, for although there
is plenty of evidence of Keats’ social
consciousness in his letters, it is only
indirectly revealed in his poetry, as per-
haps Kroeber shows in saying of Keats:
“His contemporaries share his pas-
sionate conviction that in uttering
beautifully their private visions they
contribute to a better, more fully human
life for all men that they, in fact,
help bring to birth the new life falsely
promised by political revolutionists and
social reformers, fanatic-dreamers who
are not poets.”
The Odes are closely criticised,
while useful comments are made upon
several extra poems. Surprisingly, con-
sidering the author’s own skill as a
poet, this is the least-rewarding chapter,
particularly in the treatment of “Ode
to a Nightingale.” While his general
assertions are acceptable, and the
measure of self-pity in the poem shown
to be a major contributor to its tone,
Talbot seems determined to quibble
over associations and segments beyond
the demands of the poem and to the
confusion of the reader. He demands
an unnecessary degree of literalness,
for example, of the second stanza,
which he condemns in part because he
cannot accept the synaesthesia of the
wine. Any wine-lover might tell him
that associations can be so immediate
that:
Flora and the country green,
Dance, and Provencal song, and sun-
burnt mirth
can be vividly evoked without the wine
actually tasting of “country green” or
dancing feet, and the effect of claret,
at least, is one of warmth, whether or
not it has been “Cool’d a long age in
John Keats
the deep-delv’d earth.” Experiences and
sensations would have to be self-
contained to a most unlikely degree
before these lines could be found to
contain contradictions verging on non-
sense as Talbot suggests.
This study certainly dispels any
remnants of the tradition which main-
tains that Keats was an unthinking
sensualist who created beautiful images
from his self-indulgence. It is also
refreshing that Mr. Talbot largely dis-
regards the thinking mountains and
fruitful walks view of Romanticism,
from which we all suffered at school.
Talbot rightly emphasises the intel-
lectual strength and conscious skill
revealed in Keats’ later poems, and by
discussing the evolution of the
Romantics and the range of experience
treated in their poetry he does much
to restore the balance to the novice’s
impression of Romanticism.
TIMELY TILT
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Waldo. Paul Theroux. Bodley Head.
$2.65.
THIS is a let’s-kill-Mummy book (an
offshoot of the let’s-kill-Daddy move-
ment, as the present revolt of youth has
been very aptly described). In this
movement, any old cause, even the
wrong one, will do as long as it can
be used to demonstrate dissatisfaction
at the top of its voice with the general
mess it is about to receive. This first
novel by a young American academic
is right on the current beam. “Mummy”
consists of an unholy trinity of inter-
changeable fe'males with their values
all wrong: there is Waldo’s own snivel-
ling, wall-eyed mother; the sob-storied
“Mother of the year,” Mrs. Czap; and
Clovis, his mature millionaire mistress,
who is indulging in a bit of firebugging
with the magazines in the psychiatrist’s
waiting-room when they meet. There-
after, Clovis devotes herself to setting
fire to Waldo, until he shoots her dead
in an unusual and unprintable manner.
Paul Theroux records all this in a
very readable style that hovers some-
where between neo-Dadaist and neo-
Surrealist: grotesque, absurdly tilted,
but never 'merely crazy. From the first,
Waldo and his mother talk at cross-
purposes, their conversation is a series
of non sequiturs, they use the same
words but their language is different.
Their thought runs off on tangential
lines that can never be seen to meet,
and it is hardly necessary to state on
whose side the sympathy is heavily
loaded.
The world of oldies is shown as a
world of enemies; over 30 is hostile
territory. Waldo’s supposedly loving
parents have him locked up in a
reformatory for a series of minor
domestic offences, where, half-baked by
his own jolly contemporaries, his educa-
tion is almost completed in an electric
oven. Clovis foots the bill for higher
things by getting him into Rugg College,
where the professors award God a C-
minus for Creation and the journalists’
course consists of instructions in how to
“give it to them below the belt” by a
man in a soiled felt hat. On the
campus, Waldo is revolted by the
obscenity of the obsolete, even the
flowers are smelly and real (his mother’s
window-boxes grew only decently plastic
geraniums).
Waldo’s bright ideas find a goal: soon,
as a reporter-entertainer, he is perform-
ing nightly before an appreciative
audience in a suspended glass case,
publicly wielding the power of life and
death, especially death, to the sound of
applause and his clicking typewriter.
Life for Waldo is the height of
absurdity, but death is the final in-
escapable bad joke. The death-theme
recurs in different forms and is always
slightly ridiculous: the death of a
tortoise, the death of Mrs. Czap’s little
Willy, the death of Clovis, and, maddest
of all, the foreseeable death of Waldo
himself.
The no-sense is the sense; it is
explanation without understanding. The
idea is not new (are there any new
ideas?), but 'there are some original
angles to the old, and the writing is
fluent, easy, and all of a piece. Paul
Theroux probably has other more
lastingly significant novels than this in
him, but, meanwhile, “Waldo” is hot
off the time-press and makes a very
promising starter.

Are cheering every stroke.
Even the ducks in the reeds are

DRINKING IN THE
LABELS AND FORGETTING
THE WINE
IT ALL came to a 'head last week. I
was dining and drinking with a Bul-
letin colleague, and Mrs. Batman, a
lady from Melbourne, said to me, “Now
that my husband is such a dedicated
wine-devotee, I find we get invited to
all sorts of wine dinners. You know,
those dinners put on by people who are
in, or close to, the wine trade. Do you
know, we talk about wine most of the
night?”
There was a silence. No one present
could find much wrong with that.
Mrs. Batman went on desperately.
“Oh, I don’t mind the men. You’d
expect them to carry on. It’s the wine
wives. They’re even worse than the
men. They talk about fore palates and
after-tastes and flor characters and
Limousin puncheons, whatever they are,
and I just can’t compete. I sit there
in misery.”
Knowing how she felt, one thought
of a series of attacking phrases. Don’t
counter, get in there first.
If a white wine is obviously soft
on the tongue: “Don’t you feel the acid
is rather low? The wine-maker
obviously misjudged the sugar/acid
ratio. He left the grapes on the vine
too long. They always have trouble
with Semilion in that area.”
If a white wine is obviously very
floral and fruity: “A fine aromatic nose
showing considerable perfume and
fragrance, but lacking the intensity of
complex character, which is achieved
with high-altitude grapes.” If a red
wine has a bright purple color: “A
brilliant young wine with the typical
purple rub) of a young cabernet blend.
Contains shiraz and will undoubtedly
improve with bottle age. Reflects the
urgency of the contemporary wine-
maker to get his young material into
bottle early.”
Instant winemanship.
But why should Mrs. Batman have
to compete? I am all for the pleasure
in wine, and fun in wine, and interest
in wine, but I think it’s getting a bit
much when wine talk beco'mes necessary
talk. You have to have as facile a
knowledge of a label as you do of a
play or a book or a fashion to make
small talk.
I have been to too many dinners
lately and heard of too many other
dinners during which wine has become
the sole topic of conversation. There is
just too much talk going on about
wine, and most of it is uninformed.
And, what is worse, most of the un-
informed are striving to appear in-
formed.
Masked bottles don’t help. To many
people they are an excuse for endless
eacb-way betting. “This could be a
shiraz or a shiraz/cabernet blend; on
the other hand the varietal character
could be a mataro. Area? oh, South
Australia-type blend, could be a bit of
Hunter in it, yes, and something from
north-east Victoria. Yes. Take off the
wrapper. What is it? A straight pinot
from Mount Pleasant . . . yes. I said it
was from the Hunter.”
Yet.'masked bottles are fine if used
properly. If you are serious you should
analyse the condition, color, and
character of the wine. Is it sound? Will
it live? Will it improve? are all ques-
tions that you may ask yourself and
attempt to answer.
And masked bottles are more honest
than labelled bottles. It’s all very well
to let everyone know what the wines
are beforehand, but too- many people
then drink the labels and not the
bottle.
I do wish people could be simple
and unaffected. Jim Hardy’s “Easy on
the gu'ms” still ranks as the classic
wine description, and only the other
day I heard another statement I now
value.
“Yes,” my friend said, “we ate a good
steak and they then served a good
cheese and we drank four bottles of
Reynella burgundy. In fact, we got
raptures of the bottle.”
Noble thoughts. Noble deeds!
Back to masked bottles. Only three
days ago I tasted 40 commercial, that
is, available standard, wines together.
They were all masked, so that no
prejudices or biases be brought into play.
There were some strong shocks in the
tasting, for some of the wines were very
poor indeed. Some famous names
featured quite ordinary wines, and in
some of the wines costing almost $2
a bottle a little quality had been
stretched a long, long way.
But this may make another article.
The point I wish to make now was
that all the wines were beautifully
labelled and most of them were covered
with words. Words, words, words.
“This is a fine shiraz wine made
from grapes redolent of the sunshine
of the area.”
“A unique combination of varietal
wines that harmonise to present a uni-
form character of distinction.”
“Picked in the early morning from
dew-kissed vines.”
Temperatures of fermentations,
degrees of sugar and acid, descriptions
of soil structures, every man an amateur
geologist, sandy loam, rich alluvial flats,
red volcanic topsoil, shaly granite,
quartz-washed and river washed. Per-
centages of blend, varieties I’ve never
heard of, and the regions! Lower foot-
hills, upper ranges, sunny flats, clear
higher altitudes, riverbanks, I can’t go
on. I must stop and rest awhile.
I know, I know I’ve been guilty of
many of these sins. But does this mean
that everyone has to copy me. And at
least I always talk aboult wines I
sincerely believe in and think I under-
stand. I do not just go on and on for
the sake of going on.
Some labels are downright dishonest.
I spotted a foreign name and the state-
ments “Show Award Wine” and “Vin-

or price ranges, represent either the
best wine in the class or the best value
for money in a given price range, for
example Clarets under one dollar a
bottle retail, Sydney, Riesling at one
dollar to one dollar fifty a bottle, etc.
To this end we engage in very exacting,
and meticulous comparative tastings of
competitive products, the bottles being
masked beforehand and only numbered
glasses of wine being presented to the
tasters.
As a result we have gathered hundreds
of our own and competitive commer-
cial wines, and for the last week have
had all our winemakers and a few
friends busy at work tasting them from
dawn to dusk - from Corowa in the
Riverina near Albury, Ron Prince the
manager of our Corowa Cellars and
vineyards; from the Hunter Valley,
Carl Stockhausen manager of our Ben
Ean Cellars and Vineyards; from Syd-
ney, Gerry Sissingh, our local Cellar
Manager; from our sister subsidiary
Leo Burings, John Vickery, winemaker
at Chateau Lconay, Tanunda; and
from Clare, South Australia, a young
friend, Tim Knappstein.
Surprising unanimity was achieved by
the various tasters, who taste completely
segregated one from the other; and
the results confirmed our patient and
careful quality controls.
In the under-one-dollar classes both
Cawarra Claret and Cawarra Riesling
Hock stood well out in front, whilst
in the one-dollar to one-dollar-fifty
classes our Private Bin table wines,
Bin 23 Riesling, Bin 77 White Bur-
gundy, Bin 45 Claret, Bin 50 Burgundy
and Bin 36 Porphyry Sauternes, repre-
sented tremendous and outstanding
value for money against all comers.
In the highest-quality range of whites,
our Hunter River Riesling Vintage
1967, Hunter River Chablis Vintage
1967 and Clare Valley Spatlese Moselle
were magnificent.

tage Wine” all on one label. I rang
the maker and said, “About the only
honest thing on your label is Produce
of Australia.”
“What rot!” he replied, “what about
26 fluid ounces?”
But wait. There is hope. This is the
age of Pop culture. Soon we may have
a Wine Pop culture and people will
cellar wine, not for future benefits but
for the shape of the bottle and the con-
tents of the label. It may even become
a new art form.
Then we could all get “raptures of
the bottle”
Letters
Fear of China
Gregory Clark (8., June 22) asks me
to substantiate my point that the
Chinese Government has laid the
domestic propaganda basis for border
claims on its neighbors, and demands
for suzerainty over 'them. My sources
are, first, a booklet in the British
Foreign Office series, Asian Analyst,
entitled “China and Its Frontiers,” and
a book, “The Frontiers of China,” by
Francis Watson.
Evidently Chinese schoolchildren
have been brought up on history les-
sons which lay great emphasis on the
greatness of China in the Manchu
Empire, and a principal textbook pub-
lished in 1952, “Brief History of Mod-
ern China,” by Li Pei Hua, carried a
map showing a “China” taking in the
whole of mainland South-East Asia,
Korea, and huge chunks of Russia and
India. i
The map was captioned “Chinese
territories taken by the imperialists in
the old democratic revolutionary era.”
The book was not “withdrawn,” as
Mr. Clark claims, in 1955. According
to texts “an eventual disclaimer of
official responsibility” was extracted
from the Chinese Government by the
Indian Government in 1962, during
border disputes at that time, so evi-
dently it was in circulation then.
“Pravda” took it up in September,
1964.
Watson says: “What can hardly be
disputed is that for ten years Chinese
students had been permitted, if not
encouraged, to believe that Chinese
territories taken by the imperialists
stood to be recovered.” The Foreign
Office booklet states: “The significance
of the ‘Brief History of Modern China’
and its map lay in the realisation that
they had kept before several genera-
tions of Chinese students an extreme
view of the Manchu Empire’s terri-
torial claims . . . with the distinct
implication that these stood to be
recovered.”
A colleague of Mr. Clark’s at the
Australian National University, Mr. Con
Kiriloff, who recently left Peking after
20 years working as a translator at a
publishing house there, tells me that
maps such as that in Li Pei Hua’s book
played an important part in domestic
indoctrination and propaganda. He saw
them on many occasions.
In particular, he remembers one dis-
played on a massive hoarding at a
special exhibition in Peking on 'the
10th anniversary of “Liberation” in
1959, entitled “Chinese homelands
grabbed by the imperialists.” It must
have been seen by many millions of
Chinese. Similar maps were almost
certainly on display elsewhere in China.
Mr. Kiriloff has also seen such maps
in geography textbooks.
I might point out to Mr. Clark that
Professor C. P. Fitzgerald, hardly
a harsh critic of the Chinese Govern-
ment, says that one of its foreign policy
objectives is “to regain the full territory
and standing of the Chinese Empire at
its peak” (“The Chinese view of their
place in the world,” p. 68).

Australia's roads
I am writing with reference to the
article headed “Roads—Spending the
Money Where It’s Needed” (8.,
June 8) in the section “Business and the
Economy.” In its second paragraph the
article indicates “the Commonwealth
Bureau of Roads is against” the 40 per-
cent clause in the Commonwealth Aid
Roads Act, 1964, relating to expendi-
ture on “minor” rural roads.
I do not know the source of your
information, but the fact is that the
Bureau has not made known its views
on the current 1964 legislation, nor has
it yet decided on the form or content
of its advice to the Commonwealth
Government in relation to new legisla-
tion on this matter likely to be intro-
duced into the Parliament in 1969.

Defence policy
“The Backbench Revolt,” Peter
Frankel, Chairman, Defend Australia
Committee (8., June 8), indicates that
despite similarities between the Con-
stitutions of Australia and the U.S.A.,
Australia is at a disadvantage in any
open discussions of her defence policy.
Americans have the advantage of hear-
ing or reading the views of the profes-
sionals when their Chiefs of Staff appear
before Congressional Committees. In
Australia, as in Britain, the public
only hears what the professional advice
was some 20 years after the event, when
it is merely of academic interest. Con-
sequently the public is bemused with
quasi-political slogans such as “collec-
tive security,” “forward defence,”
“fortress Australia,” and “Israeli type
citizen army.”
In any serious appreciation of Aus-
tralia’s strategic position the comparison
with Israel would, for the following
reasons, not get past first base:
1. Israel’s geographical position
means that she could be overrun by
land forces in about 48 hours.
2. Australia is a vast island whose
only frontier is the sea.
3. If the Australian Regular Army is
to exploit this favorable fact of
geography it simply cannot afford to
fritter away its strength in training an
excessive number of citizen soldiers.
