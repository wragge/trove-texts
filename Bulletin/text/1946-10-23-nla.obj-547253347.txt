LONDON AS QUEEN VICTORIA KNEW THE HEART OF EMPIRE.
Little Stanmore Church.
■DETWEEN 1718 and 1721 George Handel was organist here in
D St. Lawrence’s Church Little Stanmore, and, although his later
musical triumphs led to his being given the honour of burial in
Westminster Abbey, Handel’s organ in this church was preserved
as a relic which, in the time of Queen Victoria, attracted hundreds
of musical pilgrims. As well as that link with the past, this Little
Stanmore Church has other historical interest. The original church
was built during the reign of the eighth Henry, and the princely
Duke of Chandos had the structure almost entirely rebuilt in 1715.
It was furnished in the style of a royal chapel ;• Laguerre and
Belocci decorated its walls and ceiling, and Handel was the Duke’s
choirmaster. Asa memorial to the Duke, his remains were interred
in a chamber approached through the archway on the left of this
illustration.

JEWISH VERSIONS .
It’s, all no doubt forgotten by now, like
the winner of the 1913 Billinudgel Handi-
cap, but in pre-Hitlerite 1928 the German
Jew Emil Ludwig, later to become an
exile from Nazism and author of bio-
graphies of Stalin, Roosevelt and others,
produced a version of the story of Jesus,
The Son of Man, which caused something
of a literary stir. Indeed it achieved the
expansive, if not altogether unique, dis-
tinction of being hailed as a masterpiece.
Looked into again at this remove, the
book —in the nature of a biography—is
still readable. It is clear in both writing
and intent, and it accomplishes the aim of
setting up a figure of Jesus according
with the author’s personal reading of the
Biblical sources.
In one respect —which has nothing to
do with the merit of the reading—Ludwig
would seem to deserve a share of credit
he has not had. To allot that share, it
has first to be taken from the stock of
another Jewish creative artist whose
works are likely to be more enduring than
Ludwig’s ; possibly for better reason than
merely that they are in stone.
The other artist is Epstein, whose
sculpture version of Jesus, “Ecce Homo,”
produced in 1933, is essentially so much
like Ludwig’s version that “Ecce
Homo” is The Son of Man in solid
form. The whole rugged outline
and the effect are the same. The
result might be called rough—with
Epstein’s it was called crude and harsher
names —but it is clearly not unimpressive,
and in sum total it is with both identical.
That might be said also of the method,
Ludwig having projected his version by a
process of forceful hewing and chipping ;
a didactic style of writing, vigorous to
the point of arrogance, achieving the
same impression for the reader that
Epstein subsequently achieved for the
viewer by massive and as vigorously
carved stone. There is a power of
violence in both artists.
Ludwig declared that his aim was not
“to shake the faith which those who live
in Christ have in the divinity of Christ,”
but rather “to convince those who regard
the personality of Jesus as artificially con-
structed, that He is a real and intensely
human figure.” In the sense that anyone
who has ever lived is “a real and intensely
human figure” Ludwig achieved that aim ;
but his version, to whatever- extent it
may approximate to Jewish acceptance,
bears little resemblance to the popular
Christian version. It could be dubbed a
travesty, and might even be regarded as
a stolid attempt to make Jesus safe for
Communism (latter-day variety).
Despite his professed aim of not seek-
ing to shake Christian faith, Ludwig tries
where he can to give the miracles a
natural explanation. Those which do not
lend themselves easily to this treatment
he avoids. Of the few others, his treat-
ment of the raising of the daughter of
Jairus is typical: Jesus, “Who knows that
the ignorant countryfolk are too ready,
in cases of grievous illness, to believe that
death has come,” goes in and “wakes
the child.” On the other hand, Ludwig
has no qualms whatever about accepting
that Jesus could prophesy to Peter
before the cock crows, thou shalt deny
Me thrice,” and is not at all astonished
when the prophecy is exactly borne out.
Still, inconsistencies are certainly nothing
new in versions of the Jesus story, from
the earliest onwards.
Before putting Ludwig back on the
shelf, a quoting may have the two fish-
spear points of illustrating what’s been
said of his aggressive style and bearing
directly on another Jewish version, pre-
sented in Florence Marvyne Bauer’s Be-
hold Your King, an Australian edition of
which American best-seller has been pub-
lished by Dymocks. Said Ludwig:
The mishmash which is called a historical
novel caricaturing, as Goethe said, both
romance and history, and hardly practical
when the sources are so exiguous, would
have been in this case immoral as well
One who would venture to ascribe to Jesus
imaginary sayings and doings should be
a person at least equal to Jesus in in-
tuitive power.
The Bauer volume is a long novel of
both romance and history,-and it is fairly
thick with such passages as:
Jesus was sitting under the gallery of
Andrew’s and house, while a num-
ber of men lounged close by, listening to
him teach. The rabbi [Jesus] saw them
[new arrivals] first and a quick smile flashed
across his face. Seeing the smile, the
listeners turned to watch the newcomers
cross the court. »
“Hail, Jonathan ben Simeon ben Ezra,”
said Jesus with gentle raillery. He examined
the Cyrenian’s face quizzically as the young
man came qp to bow low before him, but
he asked no questions, waiting for Jonathan
to speak.
Whatever may be thought of the Lud-
wig-Epstein version, “gentle raillery”
would hardly be possible in it. Rocks
are not given to that sort of thing. The
, Bauer Jesus is anything but rocklike. He”
is a projection—a very effective one—of
the “suffering Messiah.” A Jewish ver-
sion, it approximates far more nearly to
the Christian than to the Ludwig-Epstein
Jewish version. , •
An oddity of the original English
edition of Ludwig’s book was that it was
illustrated from Rembrandt. Not himself
Jewish, though with associations tffat
secure him a place in the Jewish Encyclo-
pcedia— contemporary Jewish types and
personages, as well as Biblical, figure
largely in his work, and he lived for 17
years in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam
—Rembrandt depicted a version of Jesus
in most instances completely opposite to
the Ludwig-Epstein version. He could
well have been called on for illustrating
the Bauer version.
There is, however, another main char-
acter in the Bauer novel who approxi-
mates remarkably to the Ludwig-Epstein
Jesus. This is a full-length and fairly
rounded projection of Barabbas, called by
the author —no doubt from Jewish usage
and the Jewish sources she acknowledges
-—Bar Abbas. He is—or at any rate
aspires to be—the actual or temporal
King of the Jews. Leader of a mountain-
living band of robbers, he has the ascribed
merit, shared by Robin Hood, Dick Tur-
pin, Thunderbolt and Ned Kelly, of rob-
bing the rich to give to the poor. Maybe.
Anyway, this novelist puts a lot of trust
in it. Despite that, her Bar Abbas, though
mostly off stage, comes out so strongly
that, like Milton’s Satan, he gets close to
becoming the hero and stealing the show.
The novel, set wholly in Biblical Pales-
tine, really has three alternate heroes in
the fictional sense —Jonathan, a young
fellow who goes from Cyrenaica to Pales-
tine, where a rich and learned relation is
eager to get him married and make him
his heir; Bar Abbas, who is close to
launching an insurrection to end the
Roman rule when he is imprisoned, sub-
sequently to be released in preference to
Jesus, as Biblically mentioned ; and Jesus,
who, in the concluding and far the
strongest and most convincing chapters of
the novel, emerges as the finally domi-
nant figure.
Much of the going Ludwig would pos-
sibly describe as “mishmash,” but its de-
tail adds up to a very good picture of
Biblical Palestine and Palestinians. The
author accepts the miracles, and avoids
controversial issues by neatly feminine
adroitness and by restricting the main
scope of the novel to the closing three
years, a.d. 27 to 30. Jonathan—in
common with how many women-
imagined heroes, especially when they fall
in love —is definitely on the mishmash
side at times and the atmosphere of the
novel for most of the way is overhighly
colored in romantic tints ; but Bar Abbas
is good ; Pilate (not a bad chap, after all)
is also good in his brief appearance; the
“suffering Messiah” version is done with
a fine woman writer’s fine sensitiveness;
and the disciples, along with some dozens
of other incidental characters, are human
beings.
Whatever particular significance it may
have, there seems to be a revival at the
moment of writing on this particular
basis, one of the latest contributions be-
ing Robert Graves’s King Jesus, published
in America at the end of September. A
turning to religion? Or current happen-
ings in Palestine?
American Lightweight.
Margaret Halsey’s With Malice. To-
wards Some was written from the view-
point of an American woman in
temporary residence in England, where
she found much to amuse her. Arid that,
of course, is natural enough: the people
in the next town are always the funniest.
The book was a success, for it had
something, a Transatlantic tang, a flavor
and pungency of phrase, which made it
amusing. Also, it was not really
malicious —or only with that delicate
kind of malice which delights in finding
persons and situations to sharpen wit
upon. For Margaret Halsey has wit;
being, in fact, a direct literary descend-
ant of the letterwriters of another age;
of Walpole and Lady Mary Wortley-
Montague. Though not, of course, of
the diarist Pepys, who had more'than
wit.
In Some of My Best Friends (Peter
Huston, Ltd.) Margaret Halsey has fully
exploited the epistolary medium, writing
“imaginary” letters to a brother Jeff, who
is in camp somewhere in America.
Gretchen—the “I” of the story—mean-
while works patriotically in a Service-
man’s Canteen. There she levels an in-
exorable eye on the women. She paints
them clearly and amusingly, but she is
happy only with certain types:
At a distance, the formidable Alicia
seems all benevolence. She’s an old lady
with high-piled white hair and an addiction
to snowy fichus and amethyst-and-seed-
pearl jewellery. It’s only when you get
closer that you see she has the eyes and
nose of an eagle and the bearing of a con-
stipated Empress. She considers, the ser-
vicemen her social inferiors, and takes
pains to make them aware of it....
Trumpet Music.
A noticeable airiness in the contents
makes Blow, Blow Your Trumpets an
appropriate title for a novel by Shamus
Fraser (Chapman and Hall; Moore’s
Bookshop). Dealing with life before the
Flood, and perhaps influenced by
Norman Douglas’s They Went, it is told
with such a generous disregard for his-
torical probability that one is tempted to
say blow, blow Blow, Blow Your Trum-
pets altogether.
There are, for instance, the anachro-
nisms of dialogue; as when Ham and
Joctan are discussing a projected audi-
ence with the Emperor of the peculiar
region in which the novel is set —an
elderly gentleman blessed with many
wives, all unfaithful:
Ham was already helping himself, he
poured a second glass for Joctan. “Drink
this down and don’t get in a flap. Majesty’s
not at all an alarming old buffer when you
get to know him.”
“You think I’ll pass? You give me top
marks for the obeisance?”
“If only you’ll remember not to hang
y6ur hands as if you were just going into
a clinch with a peevish leopard tom or
other of your jungle friends. And don’t
glare so. Majesty won’t like being looked
at as if he were a pretty noisome species
of unidentified tree crab. And now for
Gabriel’s sake get dressed!”
“You’d say I’ll do?”*
“You’ll be a howling success. The girls
will eat you.”
Looking at Shamus’s novel as if it
were a pretty noisome species of uniden-
tified tree-crab one recalls that James
Bridie did this sort of thing very much
better in his Biblical plays where the-
characters, on the whole, were reason-
ably convincing men of their period, with
just enough anachronisms scattered
through the works to be amusing. Mr.
Fraser doesn’t get any surprise effects
with his anachronisms —they teem and
they abound—and surprise is the secret of
laughter. A magic carpet pulling up at
a celestial filling-station or being involved
in a collision due to a traffic jam is
mildly funny—in a strained and rather
childish way—but it would be a great
deal more amusing if one. weren’t expect-
ing that sort of incident.
Blow, Blow Your Trumpets is not a
historical reconstruction of the ancient
world, nor even a reasonably convincing
fantasy based on historical probabilities,
but an examination of the modern world
in a very thin disguise. And so when
Mr. Fraser wants to be satirical about the
contemporary worship of money he visits
an office where the worth of each living
soul is assessed in precise relation to the
amount of wealth it has acquired ; and
when he wants to be rude about the
talkies he takes his characters to a “Future
Palace” where events to come are ex-
hibited on a screen —the programme is
the love story of Helen of Troy; and
when he wants to satirise war and poli-
tics he invents, as one of the Ejnperor’s
cabinet, a Chief Appeaser; and so on.
As a satire the novel hits out accurately
enough, and always gaily. A love story
runs through the book and—apart from
the comedy of anachronism, which is
about on the level of the average ani-
mated cartoon —there is a good deal of
pleasant and gently Rabelaisian farce,
something like Eric Linklater’s. A light
novel, but “different”; and, after all#
with war, the Flood and a voyage in
Noali’s Ark included, a creditably sus-
tained flight of fancy.
Stories and Fragments.
“Once,” said Mr. Gallagher, “in a state
of politeness or lunacy, I attended a
literary tea-party.”
“The usual dogfight?” asked Mr.
Shean.
“Not on the surface,” said Mr. Gal-
lagher. “Everybody on this occasion was
so determined to be nice to everyone
else that, finding himself trapped with
me in a corner, a distinguished novelist
engaged me. for almost the entire even-
ing in a conversation about sea-shells.
And, since neither of us had more than
the slightest interest in the subject, I must
say we did very well.”
“You wish to point out,” asked Mr.
Shean, “that as a theme for fiction the
literary world is suitable only for low
comedy?”
“I have been reading The Collected
Stories of Katherine Mansfield (Con-
stable; Angus and Robertson),” said Mr.
Gallagher, “and I am reinforced in my
opinion that, generally speaking, authors
should leave authors alone. My strongest
general impression of this large volume
is of hundreds of wretched minor literary
people having fits of nerves.”
“Katherine Mansfield,” said Mr. Shean,
“is held in no little repute.”
“Look you,” said Mr. Gallagher, “at
that same literary tea-party the novelist
and I were rescued from our entangle-
ment of shellfish by the production of a
book of black-and-white drawings which
our host invited us to admire. They were
done by some European master of very
recent vintage, and sometimes a whole
page was occupied by a sketch of a single
arm ; or a knee-joint; or a foot. They
seemed to be very pleasant arms, knee-
bones and feet, and we praised them ex-
travagantly, as did the entire company.
Some of the drawings, which 1 were very
‘modern,’ consisted simply of wavy black
lines representing nothing in particular.
These, of course, we greeted with the
heartiest enthusiasm. We observed what
a dexterous ‘line’ the artist had. But a
kneebone, after all, is not the Venus de
Milo; and a nice wavy black line on a
piece of white paper is not an oil-painting
by Rubens. And, since I am not at a
literary tea-party, I do not hesitate to
say that I found Katherine Mansfield’s
stories altogether too scrappy.”
“They are like drops of dew,” said Mr.
Shean.
“I know,” said Mr. Gallagher. “But
a drop of dew is not the wild earth of
New Zealand.”
“Each story,” said Mr. Shean, “is like
a clear panp of glass through which one
looks into a lighted room.”
“I admit it,” said Mr. Gallagher. “But
that is not a short story ; it is a snapshot.”
“The writing,” said Mr. Shean, “is flaw-
less ; a prose delicate and glittering, like
a rill in the sunlight.”
“I acknowledge. it gladly,” said Mr.
Gallagher. “But the rill does not run
an interesting course, nor flow home to
any great ocean. Katherine Mansfield
took up the short story where Chekhov
had left it, and broke it into a thousand
glittering fragments.”
“I think,” said Mr. Shean, “you over-
state the case. Many, very many, of her
stories have a feeling of completeness;
a very great many are interesting and
nearly all are beautiful.”
“There is the most delightful freshness
in,some of her New Zealand sketches,”
said Mr. Gallagher. “I enjoyed the youth-
ful malice of her pictures of gross Ger-
mans in ‘ln a German Pension’ —too acid,
I suppose, and fragmentary, but with
body in them. A story about the two
spinster daughters of a colonel has all
the wit of De Maupassant; ‘The Woman
at the Store,’ about a murder in New
Zealand, is a • masterpiece of macabre
humor. And, if I don’t care for' the
analyses of the ‘nerves’ of literary people;
if the stories designed to make you sorry
for the poor exhibit false characterisa-
tion and false democracy—the poor
wouldn’t enjoy them; and if the stories
in which a wife falls out of love with
her husband because he does morning
exercises in a square of sunlight on the
carpet are not really interesting—yet you
could say of the collection as a whole
that there’s hardly a story which, isolated
in a magazine or an anthology, wouldn’t
strike you as brilliant. Intriguingly,
promisingly brilliant. But you can-
not read straight through the whole
book and enjoy it. The stories are
promise after promise; and promise
following promise again. But De
Maupassant is all fulfilment. Kath-
erine Mansfield should never have left her
native land and got herself tangled up
with a lot of London intellectuals, hyper-
sensitive and arty. I suppose New Zea-
land wouldn’t support her, and she had
to go ; but it was a pity. There’s a life, a
vigor, a power, a richness and a com-
pleteness about ‘The Woman at the
Store’ that you won’t find anywhere else
in her writing.”
“It is possible,” said Mr. Shean, “that
you are attracted to ‘The Woman at the
Store’ because it deals with our own part
of the world.”
“It is indeed possible,” said Mr. Gal-
lagher. “I admit it. But I am also
attracted because something happens in
it —a murder; because the telling is
powerful; because it is not just a glimpse
through a window but a properly con-
structed story with a beginning, a middle
and an end; not jusf a sketch in black-
and-white but a rich painting in oils;
not just a hand or a foot or a kneebone
but the full body of a work of art.”
“From your point of view,” said Mr.
Shean, “it is a pity they do not commit
murder at literary tea-parties.”
“That,” said Mr. Gallagher, “is a pity
from any point of view,”

Method L of removing mildew from a painted
surface?
Remove the spores in their early settlement
by washing the painted surface with a strong
hose pressure, ana repeat this practice whenever
this growth appears. If .the spores are not
readily removable by this means, a wash con-
sisting of 32.2 11. oz. strong ammonia and
B.Boz. boracic acid plus sufficient water to
make one gallon may be used. Wash the wall
thoroughly with this and dry off. An alterna-
tive wash is loz. (by weight) of hexyl resor-
cinsol with,6igal. water.
* * * *
A method of distinguishing diamonds from
false stones ?
Several ways are (a) Wipe the stone care-
fully, trace a line on it carefully with an
aluminium pencil and then rub briskly with a
moi.st cloth. If the line remains the stone is
false, (b) A file will not cut a true diamond
but will readily mark imitations, (c) A piece
of thin glass on which the edge of a diamond
is drawn will cut without much pressure, (d)
If immersed in a glass of water a diamond
will show its facets clearly, whereas a false
stone loses its sharpness and the facets are
almost indistinguishable.
* * * *
A method of repairing old maps?
All age-worn and mutilated maps and charts
are flattened out by placing the maps between
strawboards and subjecting them to heavy
weights. Repairs are then made and wherever
a rent is discovered, or a piece is missing, paper
resembling as nearly as possible the texture
and color of the original is used to restore
the map to its original appearance. The
sheets are then ready for mounting and are
so arranged, according to size, as to cover
the mounting table without crowding. The table
is prepared by pasting down at one side a cut
of cotton measuring 14ft. Sin. in length and
6ft. Sin. in width. The cotton is then pasted
down at the opposite side, care being taken
to remove all wrinkles by drawing tight until
an even and smooth surface is produced, and
the same process is repeated on the ends. The
maps are then pasted and mounted on the
cotton. The tendency to wrinkle or crease by
reason of the dampness caused by pasting is
reduced to a minimum by placing a sheet of
manilla paper on the map and rubbing it down
into the cotton with the palm of the hand or
with bone folders provided for the purpose.
The paste is prepared according to the quality
of the paper. A map on thin paper requires
a thinner paste than does one on heavy paper,
and the paste is thinned by adding a little water
and mixing thoroughly to avoid lumps. The
maps are allowed to remain on the table over-
night and are then cut off and again placed
between strawboards so that they may
thoroughly dry and flatten out. After remain-
ing in the boards for a sufficient time—gener-
ally from two to three weeks —the maps are
removed, the edges trimmed and a narrow
cotton border added to prevent fraying in
handling.
* * * *
Method of staining previously varnished floor
surrounding carpet ?
The varnish must be scraped off with a
scraper, burnt off and scraped using a blow-
lamp and scraper or scrubbed off with caustic
soda and petrol. After thoroughly cleaning
apply a suitable floor stain; when it is dry
give a coating of floor varnish or brush over
a lacquer made of two parts of golden shellac
dissolved in one part by measurement of. methy-
lated spirit. A combined stain and varnish is
quick to apply but does not wear so well.

(1) Did Phar Lap win an Australian Cup?
(2) Did he win a race of over two miles ?
(1) No. Phar Lap did not contest an Aus-
tralian Cup. (2) His only win at beyond two
miles was the A.J.C. Plate of 18 furlongs, in
which as a three-year-old he carried 7.13. He
clocked 3.49 i in that race, which is the Rand-
wick record for the distance and, incidentally,
the only time record which still gets Phar Lap
into the books. It is very likely to stand, as the
distance is no longer run at Randwick, the
A.J.C. Plate now being of 14 furlongs.

How to make a cheap and effective spray to
kill flies and mosquitoes ?
Mix lib. pyrethrum and 1 gallon of kerosene
and shake well, placing in a tightly-corked
bottle overnight, and then straining through
fine muslin, adding 3oz. methyl salicylate. The
preparation should be kept corked and away
from fire. Apply sparingly with a fene atomiser.
Brief Answers.
S.C.R.: (1) The signs SI, S 2, S 3, S 4 indicate
that the tyres have been* made to war-time
specifications issued periodically by the Gov-
ernment. (2) The same price applies irrespec-
tive of the marking. (3) Whether the retailer
and purchaser keep a record of the registered
number of the tyre is entirely up to themselves.
(4) The red spot on the side of the tyre indi-
cates that the tyre has been checked for balance
and that the point indicated is the lightest point
in the circumference of the tyre and is the
place where the valve of the tube should be
fitted to get a balanced assembly P.A.D.:
The easiest way to cook peanuts at home is
to put the shelled nuts in shallow trays in a hot
oven for about 10 minutes (experiment with a
few, as some take longer). To salt them, cook
on tray with a little butter and shake in fine
salt H.R.C.: Contact either V. Anglim, 31
Campbell-street, Sydney, or Walther and Steven-
son, 398 George-street, Sydney. The price
should be in the region of £4 10s A.P.:

IT IS CERTAIN that if all of us acted only on
facts, the Second Security Loan would be filled
over and over again. For the first fact is that in
the hands of the people there is a vast reservoir .
of surplus money.
It is a fact that this surplus money offers a constant threat of inflation, but if put into Security
Bonds, it will be used fpr purposes that will not put pressure on the price of scarce goods.
It will be used to meet continuing war commitments, to aid rehabilitation and to finance
important programmes of national works.
It is a fact that Security Bonds pay better than bank interest.
It is a fact that Security Bonds are the safest of all investments.
It is a fact that Security Bonds are also the most trouble-free investment. You can buy them
through any Bank, Savings Bank, Money Order Post Office or Stockbroker. You can buy
them by instalments as well as for cash. If an emergency arises you can sell them
readily through any Bank, Savings Bank, or Stockbroker.
TO HOLDERS
of 2i per cent. Commonwealth
Inscribed Stock or Treasury
Bonds which mature on 15th
Noveiriber next
CONVERT
your holdings (exchange them
for) equal amounts in the
Second Security Loan,
BY DOITSG SO YOU WILL:
1. Continue to draw better
than bank interest on your
money.
2. Make the most ' effective
counter you can make, as
an individual, against the
threat of inflation.
So all the facts say “buy all the bonds you can”.
FURTHER FACTS ABOUT THE
£90,000,000 SECOND SECURITY LOAN.
1. All you lend will be used to finance continuing war-
commitments, important national public works and the
continued rehabilitation of ex-service men and women.
2. Bonds for £lO, £5O, £lOO, £5OO and £l,OOO, or Inscribed
Stock, may be purchased for cash or by instalments through
any Bank, Savings Bank, Money Order Post Office or
' Stockbroker. Interest is payable each six months at
3i% per annum for 12 years or 2% per annum for 3 years.
3. Repayment in full at maturity is guaranteed by the
Commonwealth. Bonds and Inscribed Stock are readily
saleable to meet an emergency.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Name and address must appear on the MS. No liability is undertaken re
submitted; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps accompany, MS. should be adaressea
to the Editor.
F.L.O’G.: Excessive use of dialect makes
much of the conversation unintelligible P.P.:
There might be something in It —if the hand-
writing were ever deciphered... .G.W.: Senti-
mental C.Y.; Avaunt, with your beldames
and leprechauns 1.P.Q.: Anasmic 8.M.:
Ghost story bears a remarkable resemblance to
some two hundred ghost stories which find their
way here every year... .N.U.; The coincidence
of Mary meeting Tom in Singapore was re-
markable ; that they should meet again in
London was amazing; and when Tom turned
up in Sydney, was served a milk-shake by
Mary at King’s Cross, and from her learned
the clue to his uncle’s lost goldmine, “The
Astonishing Chance” was hastily placed in the
outgoing mad G.J.: “The Lone Rider”
comes a-riding back P.R.; A little historical
accuracy does no harm in an historical study.
. ...K.A.: Harmless conventionalities concern-
ing trees, mopokes and sunset... .F.G.; You
certainly sink that boat D.H.M.: Chopped-
up prose J.C.S.: You’re game, anyhow
LB.: He’s a noble hatter, but you haven’t
boiled him down satisfactorily... .G.R.: “Any
hope for the above?” Not here be10w....
Kenlock: You think there’s nothing worse than
the way a sheep looks at you before you slay
it? You should have seen the way that poem
looked at us... .R.McD.: Promising if you’re
young... .K.M.: If’ it’s a “maiden effort” why
do you write as if you were living in last
century? ... .M.C.McK.: Compare your “Old
Mariner” with Coleridge’s Bill: “I’m leav-
ing.” So’s the poem M.G.: “No maid,
no task can me imbue.” Grammatically speak-
ing, she or it would find it very difficult, any-
how. .. .8.E.: Pleasant. But why let the rhyme
beat you? ... .W.H.S.: Well, it’s a change to
find the maidens of the moon in the mailbox.
....A.W.A.: It frisks like an elephant
S.C.: Two lines, for countless thousands
mourn:
Now they call them pubs no longer; they’re “hotels”
all style and swank;
When I breast the polished counter it’s like drinking
in a bank.
Lyppe: And that’s about enough lip from
you... .L.P.R.: You seem to be standing tip-
toe upon an abyss in Darien R.G.D.:
“Sand Erosion” is sandy and eroded J.H.S.:
Not much chance, yet there’s feeling in them.'
... .L.O’N.; Come in and bring the animal: —
No stratagems of peerless riders
Can beat him to the post
When Bernborough stretches out his swanlike strides
To greet his genial host.
... .F.M.8.: Not here will those bushland bees
be humming L.D.W.: The first paragraph
was almost enough:—
Two men made their way wearily along carry-
ing with them the never-changing girdle of the
horizon. The gibbers beneath their aching feet
transmitted their blistering heat through worn
boots to sensitive skin. Mercilessly the Nullabor
held them in its stony grip. Though their
mouths were dry and tongues beginning to swell
they did not drink, for the precious drop they
possessed must last another day. At last blessed
night rolled over the chalky plain.
J.O.McD.: Humor heavy-handed J.E.:
Let the “Unsung Hero” remain unsung
8.C.J.: Cattle dogs that tear out travellers’
throats unheard of in this part of the country.
. . ..A.Q.: Excessively tearful J.M.H.: Try
a daily. V.M.P.; Nice descriptions of scenery,
poor analysis of character T.W.: Rambling.
F.K.: Slight D.McC.: “The Refugee”
is technically well-balanced, competently written,
humorous; but too slick and mechanical
O.S. and G.L.H.: Black-bearded pirates with
ruffles and lace and archaic oaths, and young
ladies who win beauty competitions, are usually
laid to waste in the w.p.b Tooma Ted:
It’s a long way from Paterson, but here
goes:—
W.W.: Overwritten P.U.: Write about
what you know from direct observation....
G.K.: Avoid abstract philosophy.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.C.: We will never believe that a child of
that shape could be “the apple of his mother s
eye” W.D.: You leave far too much, un-
done L.W.: Much improved, but make
them less scratchy... .M.A.J.: It has nothing
to recommend it... .R.F.W.: You lack con-
fidence. Study hard and practise a lot
M.F.: The joke is a poor relation of one
printed last month... .K.B.; If you must dig
up things try potatoes, w*jt chestnuts.... 1 .A..
You haven’t made them sufficiently humorous.
W N.; Five dreadful drawings boldly
marked “For the Bulletin Christmas Num-
ber, 1946.” You’ve no lack of self-confidence,
anyway.... J.A.F1.: Cultivate a style of your
own P.J.: Not keen on weird-looking figure
emerging from the drainpipe.—B.S.; A waste
of time, ink, paper and stamps... .S.M.: Which
is thetfringbarked tree and which the girl from
the city? L.D.: Submitted the caricature to
three men who knew him and all turned their
thumbs down... .A.W.: You . have a wooden
style and no sense of humor... .H.A.R. :
Almost a horrible example W.G. : We don t
want colored crayon drawings, and in any case
the sample submitted is hopeless V.P.: As
you are “fond of drawing” it would do you
no harm to take some lessons N.C.: That
type of sketch is old-fashioned. Draw situa-
tions F.S.: The drawing is nothing to write
home about, but it’s miles too good for the
gag J.B'.L.: That gag’s whiskers could
anchor a liner... Oldest talking-parrot
gag in captivity.
Up and down the Upper Murray,
Folks were heard to say,

It’s the big Oup Day.”

THREE OF A KIND
By BERNARD CRONIN
THE man with the corticated eye-
brows cast his newspaper to one
side and began to fill his pipe. He
said: “All this talk about Europe’s
problems makes me sick. And when I
say sick, I mean sick. They don’t know
what a rea\ problem is over there. Take
this silly atom-bomb business, f’r in-
stance ; it’s child’s play to some of the
arguments I’ve known in my time. I
bet not one of ’em has ever even heard
of the Sugar Loaf Landslide Case that
happened here in these very hills, away
back in 1904. Or was it 1906? I never
can remember dates. Now there was
a problem, if you like. It packed not
one headache, but a whole darned truck-
load of ’em. Lawyers’ headaches, too,
not the sort you take medicine for. The
Paris Talks! Bah!”
The fat man in gaudy shirtsleeves who
was staring through the open .carriage
window at the passing prospect of mid-
summer countryside mopped his bald
head vigorously, and said: “I’m damned
if I know why, but this hot weather
always does funny things to my liver.
Sort of curries it, if you know what I
mean. Now some people I know”
The corticated man interrupted briskly.
He was not to be sidetracked. With a
contemptuous glance at the remaining
occupant of the compartment —a small,
dehydrated man, with a *meek tangle of
whisker and a dyspeptic nose, who was
then drinking from a bottle of milk —he
continued; “The papers insisted on call-
ing it ‘The Great Landslide Lawsuit.’ I
daresay you remember it. It was. the
talk of the town. , I’ll go 'so far as to
say that it was the sensation of the times,
although only a few of us knew the news
behind the news, as the saying is. It
caused more - argument than Murphy’s
bull. And it started right here in’ these
Gippsland hills, practically next door to
where I used to live as a kid. Sensa-
tional! I ask you. It was terrific.”
The small man had finished his milk.
He wiped his meek whiskers with a
spotted blue handkerchief, settled his
necktie fastidiously, and began to eat a
sandwich.
The fat man yawned cavernously and
said; “Time certainly marches on.”
THE train had crawled to a halt at
1 a wayside station. Unseen but ener-
getic hands were juggling empty milk-
cans up and down the platform, and a
smell of train-oil and smoke seeped into
the carriage. When the uproar subsided
and the train began to gather fresh way,
the man with the corticated eyebrows
became audible once more.
“Up around North Mirboo they’d
probably write to their local Member of
Parliament if they
didn’t get a landslide
of some kind once a
week or so. It’s all
a matter of habit,
d’y’ see? And
there’s nothing you
miss so much as a
habit, especially if
it’s a bad one. Up
in the Islands it’s
malaria. In New
Zealand it’s earthquakes. Here in Gipps-
land it’s landslides. Mostly they’re so
small nobody takes any notice of ’em,
unless they happen to block the road to
the pub. But this landslide I’m telling
you about at Sugar Loaf was right out
of the box. She was a humdinger. She
made history—past, present and to come,
I know for a fact that the arguments she
set up were responsible for half the
divorce cases that season, and started
more free fights up and down Australia
than the football semi-finals over twenty
years. But the big thing is that she threw
a spanner into our legal machinery that
just missed wrecking the entire Aus-
tralian Constitution.” *
“Sounds worse than the hives,” said
the fat man. “I never get in among the
dogwood without I cop it. I itch all
over. My skin’s like”
“Of course,” said the man with the
corticated eyebrows, loftily; “if you’re
not interested . . .”
“I’m fascinated,” said the fat man. “In-
terested is much too weak a word to use.
Fascinated. And I only say that because
I can’t think of an even better word.”
“There was a spud farmer,” said the
corticated man, mollified, “who had a
320-acre block over the slope of a big
hill. I can’t remember his name ; I never
can remember names. Call him Smith.
An up-and-coming young chap he was,
too, by all accounts ; single, temperate and
hard working. Well, down below his
block was another block owned by a
man —call him Jones. Smith’s block was
as clean as your pockets after the Mel-
bourne Cup; but Jones’s block was like
one of nature’s junk-yards. It was stuffed
with bracken-fern —20 feet high, if
it was an inch. It was so thick that a
rabbit couldn’t have got through it ; no,
not if it was being chased by a million
beagles. Jones didn’t live on the block,
unfortunately. What I mean is, if he had
lived there it would have been the stone
end of him, and no story to tell. There’d
have been no lawsuit, or any fuss at all,
because he was a single man, like Smith,
with no heirs-at-law, and so forth and
so on. You see what I mean. The whole
thing would have died out, and nobody
outside the district would even have heard
of it. I daresay I shouldn’t have heard
of it myself.”
“Pity,” said the small man, a little in-
distinctly—being midway through his
second sandwich,
THE man with the corticated eye-
brows stared at him.
“What did you say?”
“Nothing of any consequence,” said
the small man.
“H’m,” said the corticated man. He
rammed at his pipe fiercely. “Well, as
I was saying... They
tell me it was one
of the hardest winters
they’ve ever had
in Gippsland that
year. The rain would
have scared Noah
stiff. Landslides went
off like crackers on a
string. The whole
look of the place
changed that fast and
often that men would
go away to work
in the mornings and
at night-time couldn’t
find their way back to
their own homes,
without their wives
came half-way to
meet ’em. Cold, too.
Freezing. Just the
weather for land-
slides, You get to
know it after a while.
In short, the stage
was set for tragedy—did you say some-
thing, sir?”
The small man waved his sandwich.
He said; “I was only choking. A piece
went down the wrong way . .
“Bah!” said the corticated man. He
thrust a finger at the fat man. “What
sort of a bush lawyer are you?”
“Oh, so-so,” said the fat man modestly.
“Then work this out,” said the man
with the corticated eyebrows. “One night
the whole three-hundred and twenty acres
belonging to Smith slid off the hill, like
you might have greased it with soap, and
settled right slap-bang on top of Jones’s
block. Not just the skin of it, mind you,
but to a depth of about sixty or seventy
feet. House and all. Yards, sheds,
fences, livestock —the whole set-up, just
as it stood. Now you’d hardly credit a
thing like that, would you?”
“Amazing!” said the fat man. “Stupi-
fying! ”
“Overwhelming!” said the corticated
man. “When Smith climbed out of bed
in the morning and realised what had
happened he nearly had a fit. The really
extraordinary part of it was that the
forty-feet well by the harness-shed had
come along with the rest of the things.
Not a drop of water was missing. Not
a drop. You never saw such a thing v in
your life.”
“You tell the story so graphically,”
said the fat man ; “you might have seen
the whole thing yourself.”
The corticated man waved the eulogy
aside. He said: “Ah, but listen to this.
Talk about your legal tangles! As soon
as the news got around very naturally
Jone§ got to hear of it. He was furious.
Furious. He accused Smith of doing it
on purpose ; said he was trespassing in
a large way, and he’d give him twenty-
four hours to get his farm off the place
or he’d raise the Old Harry. Smith
argued that he was still on his own
property and intended to stay there. He
said that Jones could go away and find
a hole in the creek and bury himself. So
then Jones sued him. The local J.P.
nearly went trying to decide where
the rights of the thing lay, and the police
were at their wits’ end. So they sent the
case to the Melbourne Courts. And
they couldn’t decide, either. Smith’s
lawyers held that the whole thing came
under the heading of Act of God; that
as he held a clear title to his own land
nobody could dispossess him. They said
that, not wishing to be hard on Jones,
their client* was graciously agreeable to
allowing Jones to sink a shaft on Smith’s
land so that he could reach his own
property and keep an eye on it, so to
speak.
“On the other hand, Jones’s lawyers
claimed that it was a case of deliberate
trespass, aggravated bv the fact that in
trespassing Smith had brought all his
real estate along with him, including even
the sub-soil; that the suggestion of de-
fendant’s counsel that Jones should mine
his bracken-fern for bedding for his cows,
instead of harvesting it as formerly, con-
stituted contempt of court, and should be
severely dealt with by the Court; and,
finally, that Smith should either vacate
Jones’s property lock, stock and barrel, or
purchase it outright, -or pay an annual
rental to be fixed. And nobody could
decide how the law ran. Not even the
High Court or the Full Court or the
Attorney-General or the Governor-in-
Council. In the end funds were raised by
public subscription
and two eminent
K.Cs. were sent to
England to argue the
case before the Privy
Council. But even
they couldn’t make
head or tail of it.
So everybody got
sick of the whole
thing and it was
thrown into Chan-
cery. So far as I
know it’s still there,”
The small man
asked politely:
“What time do we
get to Warragul?”
He was ignored.
The fat man had a
strange light in his
eye. He said earn-
estly: “Dumbfound-
ing! But I wonder
if you’ve heard the
sequel?”
“The what?” said the man with the
corticated eyebrows in a startled voice.
<<nr HE sequel,” said the fat man. He
I smirked modestly. “Even more
extraordinary, if I may say so, than what
you’ve been telling me. By the most
curious coincidence I am in a position
to.relate it. The thing, you see, touches
me personally.”
The corticated man echoed faintly:
“Personally! ”
“That’s what I said,” said the fat man.
“It’s a funny thing, but that man Smith
was my wife’s uncle, on her mother’s
side. He’s a kind of family legend, if
you know what I mean; like Father
Christmas, or a haunted house, and those
sort of things. But come now: you
must have heard of the succeeding law-
suit between Smith and Jones? It never
got as far as the Privy Council, certainly ;
but the very dogs used to bark it.”
The man with the corticated eyebrows
seemed to have got a grip of himself.
He said: “Possibly I was out of the
country at the time. I travel a good
deal ...”
“It seems,” said the fat man enjoyably,
“that one day Jones was pottering around
on the bare hillside where Smith’s farm
used to be, when he stumbled over a half-
buried rock. Something about it took his
attention and next day he went secretly
to Melbourne and had the specimen
analysed or assayed, or whatever the
term is—l never can remember these
technical terms. It turned out to be 100
per cent, pure arsenic.”
“Arsenic!” said the corticated man.
“Arsenic,” said the fat man firmly. “It
was an arsenic mine. Like they have over
in Arizona. Or is it Nevada? % I never
can remember Jones, in short,
had stumbled over a fortune. He imme-
diately got a miner’s right and hurried
back to peg out his claim. Meanwhile,
by the most singular chance —my wife,
by the way, attributes it to a dream
Smith had after drinking a lot of milk
and getting indigestion: you know how
romantic women are—Smith, I say, also
discovered the secret. He was actually
pegging his own claim wfien Jones arrived
back on the scene. There was a fearful
row between them (naturally old scores
would be revived), and, but for the arrival
of a posse of mounted police, there would
have been bloodshed. The matter was
taken to Court. By a further coincidence
the same J.P. presided. If he went nearly
insane over the first case, you can under-
stand that this case completed the busi-
ness. His friends had to take him away
somewhere where his mind could be cared
for, and the case went on to the Mel-
bourne Courts. Jones’s lawyers argued
that as he was the actual discoverer
Smith was automatically non-suited.
They said, however, that not wishing to
be hard on Smith they were agreeable to
paying him a royalty on all arsenic
mined. On (he other hand, Smith’s
lawyers went hot and strong to show that
under the terms
of his original
purchase of the
land he could
claim possession
only for a depth
of 50 feet from
the surface: as
this surface had
been removed by
Act of God
Smith was entitled
to begin counting from the new surface.
I hope you follow me?” .
“Fascinating!” said the corticated man,
in a hollow voice,
“The thing became so involved,” con-
tinued the fat man, “that in the end they
had to give it up, just as they did in your
—I mean, as they did in the first case.
By that time practically every lawyer in
Australia had argued himself hoarse, and
I believe the sale of patent cough medi-
cines was phenomenal. Fortunately
someone discovered an old Act of Parlia-
ment —from the reign of Charles I, I
understand —that had never been re-
pealed, and now came in very usefully.'
In short, the arsenic mine was taken over
by the Crown for future development.
But not before Jones, in the madness of
his disappointment, had poisoned
by eating the original specimen,. It’s a
very sad story. We don’t often talk about
it at home.”
The man with the corticated eyebrows
fought for breath. He said, as the train
began to slow down: “Don’t mind me.
What happened to your wife’s —what
happened to Smith? He poisoned him-
self too, I suppose?”
“No,” said the fat man gravely; “he
hanged himself. With his braces. It
created quite an advertising boom, I be-
lieve, for the particular brace-makers.
Or should I say braces-makers? I never
can remember my syntax. It argued
tremendous strength in their product, you
see ; and the ‘Smith Braces,’ as they re-
named the line, were terrifically popular,
especially with wives seeking a suitable
present for their husbands.”
< < CXCUSE me,” said the small man.
The corticated man and the
fat man stopped glaring at each other, and
glared at the small man. Unperturbed,
he wiped the last crumbs from his meek
whiskers and reached up to the rack for
his luggage. He-said: “Naturally you,
gentlemen were not to know it: but the
fact is I always feel a little uncomfortable
when I overhear myself being discussed in
public.”
The fat man gaped.
“ToMrself!” said the man with the
corticated eyebrows. “I like that. Now
will you tell me where you come into
this?”
“You were talking of my suicide,” said
the small man, with dignity. “Interesting,
but a little painful —even in retrospect.”
“You wouldn’t be Smith, would you?”
said the corticated man, with passionate
sarcasm.
“Or Jones?” said the fat man.
“I was both of them,” said the small man.
He slid to the platform and vanished.
A passing porter bellowed: “Warragul

THE NUREMBERG JUDGMENT.
The judgment was a document of more
than 50,000 words. It declared:
“The indictment charges the defendants with
crimes against peace by the planning, prepara-
tion, initiation and waging of wars of aggres-
sion : with war crimes: and with crimes against
humanity: also with participating in the formu-
lation or execution of a common plan or con-
spiracy to commit all these crimes. The
Tribunal was further asked by the prosecution
to declare certain named groups or organisa-
tions to be criminal.
‘The following acts are crimes coming within
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for which there
shall be individual responsibility:
“a. Crimes against .peace viz., planning,
preparation, initiation or waging of a war of
aggression, or a war in violation of treaties
LORD JUSTICE LAWRENCE:
Presiding Judge.
or assurances or participation in a conspiracy
for the accomplishment of any of the fore-
going.
“b. War crimes—viz., violations of laws or
customs of war, including murder, ill-treatment
or deportation of civilian population, murder
or ill-treatment of p.o.w. or persons on the
seas, killing of hostages, plunder of property,
wanton destruction or devastation not justified
by military necessity.
“c. Crimes against humanity—viz., murder,
extermination, enslavement, deportation, and
other inhumane acts committed against civilian
population, before or during war, or persecu-
tions on political, racial or religious grounds.
“Leaders, organisers, instigators, and accom-
plices participating in the formulation or execu-
tion of a conspiracy to commit any of the
foregoing crimes are responsible for all acts
performed by any persons in execution of such
plan.
“For the purpose of showing the background
of the aggressive war and war crimes charged,
the Tribunal will begin by reviewing some of
the events that followed the first World War,
and by tracing the growth of the Nazi party
under Hitler to a position of supreme power
from which it controlled the destiny of the
German people, and paved the way for the
commission of the crimes charged.”
The document records the rise of the
Nazi party. It describes the ruthlessness
of the methods pursued from the time of
the formation of the German Labor
party in 1919, through the days of the
abortive Putsch of 1923 and the “Rohm
purge” of 1934, down to the time when
the party was in control of every activity
in Germany.
Germany Rearms
“During the years following Hitler’s appoint-
ment as "Chancellor, the Nazis set about re-
organising the economic life of Germany and
in particular the armament industry. It was
necessary to lay a secure financial foundation
for the building of armaments, and in April,
1936, Goring was appointed co-ordinator for
raw materials. In this capacity he brought to-
gether the War Minister, the Ministef of
Economics, the Reich Finance Minister, the
president of the Reichsbank and the Prussian
Finance Minister to discuss problems connected
with war mobilisation, and on May 27, 1936,
in addressing them said “All measures are to be
considered from the standpoint of an assured
waging of war.”
“On October 14, 1938, at another conference.
Goring announced that Hitler had instructed
him to organise a gigantic armament pro-
gramme which would make insignificant all
previous achievements. He had been ordered
to build an air force five times as large as
originally planned, to increase the speed of
the rearmament of the Navy and Army, and
to concentrate on offensive weapons, principally
heavy artillery and heavy tanks.
“In this reorganisation the Nazis found Ger-
man industry quite willing to co-operate. In
April, 1933, Gustav Krupp von Bohlen sub-
mitted to Hitler a plan for the reorganisation
of industry. He stated that ‘the turn of political
events is in line with the wishes which 1 myself
and the board of directors have cherished for a
long time.’ What Krupp meant by this statement
is xully shown by the draft text of a speech
which he planned to deliver in the University
of Berlin in January, 1944.
“He wrote: It is the one great merit of the
German war economy that it did not remain
idle during those bad years, even though its
activity could not be brought to light. Through
years of secret work, scientific and basic ground-
work was laid in order to be ready to work
for the armed forces at the appointed hour,
without loss of time or experience Only
through the secret activity of German enter-
prise was it possible after 1933 to fall into
step with the new task of restoring Germany’s
military power.
“At the same time that this preparation of
the German economy for war was being carried
out, the German armed forces were preparing
for a rebuilding of Germany’s aimed strength.
The Navy was particularly active. The official
German naval historians, Assmann and
Gladisch, admit that the Treaty of Versailles
had only been in force for a few months
before it was violated, particularly in the con-
struction of a new submarine arm. On May
12,' 1934, Raeder issued the top secret arma-
ment plan. This contained the sentence; ‘All
preparations are to be drawn up with a primary
view to readiness for war without any alert
period.’ In the year 1940 Raeder wrote:
‘The Fiihrer hoped until the last moment to
be abie to put off the conflict with England
until 1944-45. At that time, the Navy would
have had available a fleet with a powerful
U-boat superiority.’
To weirds Aggressive War
“The charges that the defendants planned
and waged aggressive wars are of the utmost
gravity. War is essentially an evil thing. Its
consequences affect the whole world. To initi-
ate a war of aggression, therefore, is the
supreme international crime, differing only from
other war crimes in that it contains within itself
the accumulated evil of the whole.
“The first acts of aggression referred to in
the indictment are the seizure of Austria and
Czechoslovakia, and the first war of aggression
charged is the war against Poland. The war
against Poland did not come suddenly out of a
clear sky. It was premeditated and carefully pre-
pared, and was not undertaken until the
moment was thought opportune for it to be
carried through as a definite part of the pre-
ordained scheme and plan.
“The aggressive designs of the Nazi Govern-
ment were not accidents arising out of the
immediate political situaticrn in Europe and
the world; they were a deliberate and essential
part of Nazi policy. From the beginning the
National-Socialist movement claimed that its
object was to unite the German people in the
consciousness of their mission and destiny,
based on inherent qualities of race, and under
the guidance of the Fiihrer. For its achieve-
ment, two things were deemed essential: the
disruption of the European order and the
creation of a greater Germany. This necessarily
involved the seizure of foreign territories. War
was seen to be inevitable if these purposes
were to be accomplished. The German people,
therefore, with all their resources, were to be
organised as a great political-military army,
schooled to obey without question.
“In Mein Kampf Hitler had made this
view quite plain. It must be remembered that
Mein Kampf was no mere private diary in
which the secret thoughts of Hitler were set-
down. It was used in the schools and univer-
sities and among the Hitler Youth, in the S.S.
and the S.A., and among the German people
generally, even down to the presentation or
an official copy to all newly-married people.
The general contents are well known. Over
and over again Hitler asserted his belief in
the necessity of force as the means of solvmg
international problems, as in the following
quotation: ‘The soil on which we live was not
a gift bestowed by Heaven on our forefathers.
They had to conquer it by risking their lives.
So also in the future, our people will not
obtain territory, and therewith the means of
existence, as a favor from any other people,
but will have to win it by the power of a
triumphant sword.’
“Mem Kampf is quite explicit in stating
where the increased territory is to be found;
‘Therefore we have drawn a line through the
line of conduct followed by pre-war Germany.
We put an end to the perpetual Germanic
march towards the South and West and turn
our eyes towards the lands of the East. When
we speak of new territory in Europe today
we must think principally of Russia and the
border States subject to her.’
The Conspiracy Develops
“Evidence from captured documents has re*
vealed that Hitler held four secret meetings
to which the Tribunal makes special reference
because of the light they shed upon the question
of the common plan. These meetings took
place on November 5, 1937, May 23, 1939,
August 22, 1939, and November 23, 1939. Im-
portant declarations were made by Hitler as to
his purposes, which are quite unmistakable in
their terms. The Tribunal is of opinion that
the documents are of the highest value, and
that their authenticity is established. They are
careful records of the events they describe, and
they have been preserved as such in the archives
of the German Government.
“It will be useful to deal first with the meet-
ing of November 23, 1939, when Hitler called
his Supreme Commanders together. He re-
viewed his task since 1919, and referred to the
occupation of the Rhineland, the seizure of
Austria, and the action against Czechoslovakia.
He stated: ‘The next step was Bohemia,
Moravia and Poland. It was clear from the
first that I could not be satisfied with the
Sudefenland. That was only a partial solu-
tion. The decision to march into Bohemia
was made. Then followed the erection of
the Protectorate, and with that the basis
for the action against Poland was laid,
but I wasn’t quite clear whether I should start
first against the East and then in the West or
vice versa I did not organise the armed
forces in order not to strike. The decision to
strike was always in me. Earlier Or later 1
wanted to solve fhe problem.’
“This address, reviewing past events and re-
affirming the aggressive intentions present from
the beginning, puts beyond doubt the character
of the actions against Austria, Czechoslovakia
and Poland. Hitler was looking back to things
accomplished; at the earlier meetings he was
looking forward and revealing his plans to his
confederates.
“At the meeting on November 5, 1937, Hitler
requested that the statements he was about to
make should be looked upon in the case of
his death as his last will and testament. His
main theme was the problem of living space,
and he discussed various solutions, only to set
them aside. He then said that the seizure of
living space on the Continent was necessary.
‘The history of all times has proved that space
expansion can only be effected by breaking
resistance and taking risks. Even setbacks are
unavoidable; neither formerly nor today has
space been found without an owner; the
attacker always comes up against the proprietor.
The question for Germany is where the greatest
possible conquest could be made at the lowest
cost.’
“Nothing could indicate more plainly the
aggressive intentions of Hitler. It is impossible
to accept the contention that he did not actually
mean war; for he continued: ‘The German
question can be solved only by way of force
lf we place the decision to apply force at
the head of the following expositions, then we
are left to reply to the questions “when?” and
“how?” ’ The decision to seize Austria and
Czechoslovakia was discussed in detail; the
action was to be taken as soon as a favorable
opportunity presented itself.
“The defendant Goring testified that he did
not believe at that time that Hitler actually
meant to attack Austria and Czechoslovakia.
Raeder testified that neither he, nor Von
Fritsch, nor Von Blomberg, believed that Hitler
actually meant war, a conviction which the de-
fendant claims he held up to August 22, 1939.
The basis of this cbnviction was his hope that
Hitler would obtain a ‘political solution’ of
Germany’s problems. But all that this means,
when examined, is the belief that Germany’s
position would be so good, and Germany’s
armed might so overwhelming, that the territory
desired could be obtained without fighting for
it. If any doubts had existed in the minds of any
of tys hearers in November, 1937, after March
of 1939 there could no longer be any question
that Hitler was in deadly earnest in his decision
to resort to war.”
After an account of the seizure of
Austria, “a premeditated aggressive step
in furthering the plan to wage aggressive
wars against other countries,” the judg-
ment then turns to Czechoslovakia,
“On March 11, 1938, Goring made two
separate statement’s to the Czechoslovak Minis-
ter in Berlin, assuring him that the develop-
ments then taking place in Austria would in
no way have any detrimental influence on the
relations between the Reich and Czechoslovakia.
This design to keep Czechoslovakia quiet while
Austria was absorbed was a typical manoeuvre
on the part of Goring, which he was to repeat
later in the case of Poland.
“On May, 30, 1938, a directive signed by
Hitler declared his ‘unalterable decision to smash
Czechoslovakia by military action in the near
future.’ On August 31 Hitler approved a
memorandum by Jodi concerning the timing of
the order for the invasion.
“These facts demonstrate that the occupa-
tion of Czechoslovakia had been planned in
detail long before the Munich conference. That
Hitler never intended to adhere to the Munich
Agreement is shown by the fact that a little
later he asked Keitel for information with
regard to the military force which in his
opinion would be required to break all Czech
resistance. On October 21, 1938, a directive
was issued by Hitler, and countersigned by
Keit'el, to the armed forces on their future
tasks, which stated: ‘Liquidation of the re-
mainder of Czechoslovakia. It must be pos-
sible to smash at any time the remainder of
Czechoslovakia if her policy should become
hostile towards Germany.’
To Grab Poland
“On April 3, 1939, a directive issued to the
armed forces made reference to Fall Weiss (the
code name for the invasion of Poland), and
stated: ‘The Fiihrer has added the following
directions to Fall Weiss: (1) Preparations must
be made that the operation can be carried out
at any time from September 1, 1939. (2) The
High Command has been directed to draw up
a precise timetable for Fall Weiss.’ On April
11 a further directive was issued, and in one
of the annexes the words occur; ‘Should Poland
adopt a threatening attitude towards Germany
a final settlement will be necessary, notwith-
standing the pact. The aim is then to destroy
Polish military strength. Danzig will be in-
corporated info Germany at the outbreak of
the conflict at the latest.’
“In spite of the contents of these two direc-
tives, Hitler made a speech in the Reichstag
on April 28, 1939, in which he stated: ‘Poland,
like Czechoslovakia a year ago, believes, under
the pressure of a lying international campaign,
that it must call up troops, although Germany
has not called up a single man, and had not
thought of proceeding in any way against
Poland The intention to attack on the part
of Germany was invented by the international
press ’
“Four weeks after making this speech Hitler,
on May 23, 1939, held an important military
conference in which he announced his decision
to attack Poland. ‘There is no question of
sparing Poland. We cannot expect a repetition
of the Czech affair. There will be war.’
“The Fiihrer’s speech to the Commanders-in-
Chief on August 22, 1939, began by saying:
‘Now Poland is in the position in which I
wanted her.... 1 am only afraid that at the
last moment some Schweinehund will make a
proposal for mediation.’ It contains a state-
ment that an appropriate propaganda reason
for invading Poland would be given, the truth
or falsehood of which was unimportant, since
‘the Right lies in Victory.’
“After all attempt's to persuade Germany to
agree to a settlement had failed Hitler, on
August 31, announced that the attack would
start in the early morning of September 1.
In the opinion of the Tribunal, the events of
the days immediately preceding September 1,
1939, demonstrate the determination of Hitler
and his associates \o carry out the invasion of
Poland at all costs. The.. Tribunal is fully
satisfied that the war initiated by Germany
against Poland was most plainly an aggressive
war, which was to develop / into a war which
embraced almost the whole world, and resulted
in the commission of countless crimes, both
against the laws and 'customs of war, and
against humanity.
The War Spreads
“The aggressive war against Poland was but
the beginning. The aggression of Nazi Ger-
many quickly spread from country to country.
In point of time the first two countries to suffer
were Denmark, and Norway.
“On September 2, 1939, Germany sent a
solemn assurance to Norway: ‘The Reich is
determined in view of
the friendly relations
which exist between
Norway and Germany
under no circum-
stance to prejudice
the inviolability and
integrity of Norway,
and to respect the
territory tf the Nor-
wegian State.’
“On April 9, 1940,
in pursuance of her
plan of campaign,
Norway was invaded
by Germany. The
idea of attacking Nor-
way originated, it
appears, with the de-
fendants Raeder and
Rosenberg. The de-
fence has been made
that Germany was
compelled to attack
Norway to forestall
an Allied invasion,

Death.
and her action was therefore preventive. It must
be remembered that preventive action in foreign
territory is justified only in case of ‘an instant
and overwhelming necessity for self-defence,
leaving no choice of means, and no moment
of deliberation.’ Raeder’s memorandum ot
October 3, 1939, makes no reference to fore-
stalling the Allies, but is based upon ‘the aim
of improving our strategical and operational
position.’
“No suggestion is made by the defendants
that there was any plan by any belligerent,
other than Germany, to occupy Denmark. No
excuse for that aggression has ever been ottered.
In the light of all the available evidence U
is impossible to accept the contention that the
invasions of Denmark and Norway were de-
fensive, and in the opinion of the Tribunal they
were acts of aggressive war.
“The plan to seize Belgium and the Nether-
lands was considered in August, 1938, when
the attack on Czechoslovakia was being formu-
lated. In May, 1939, when Hitler made his
decision to attack Poland, and foresaw the
possibility of a war with England and Prance
in consequence, he told his commanders.

until May of 1940. At the conference on

thousand affidavits signed by 155,000
people were submitted ,on behalf of the
political leaders, 136,213 on behalf. of
the S.S., 10,000 on behalf of the S.A.,
7000 on behalf of the S.D., 3000 on
behalf of the General Staff and 0.1f.W.,
and 2000 on behalf of the Gestapo. The
Tribunal itself heard 22 witnesses for the
organisations.
Much of the evidence presented by
the prosecution was documentary evi-
dence captured by the Allied armies.
The case against the defendants rested
in a large measure on documents of their
own making, the authenticity of which
was not challenged.
The defendant Robert Ley committed
suicide in prison on October 25, 1945.
The Tribunal decided that the defend-
ant Gustav Kriipp von Bolden could not
he_ tried because of his physical and
mental condition but that the charges
against him should be retained for trial
thereafter if his condition should permit.
It decided to try the defendant Bor-
mann in his absence.
policies long considered and prepared and
was plainly an act of aggressive war. The
resolve to invade was made without any other
consideration than the advancement of the
aggressive policies of Germany.
“On August 12, 1939, Hiller had a conver-
sation with Ciano and the defendant Ribben-
trop. He then said: ‘Generally speaking, the
best thing to happen would be for the neutrals
to be liquidated one after the other. This
process could be carried out more easily if on
every occasion one partner of the Axis covered
the other while it was dealing with the uncertain
neutral. Italy might well regard Yugoslavia
as a neutral of this kind.’ This observation
was made only two months after Hitler had
given assurances to Yugoslavia that he would
regard her frontier as final and inviolable.
“On April 6, 1941, German forces invaded
Greece and Yugoslavia without warning. As
the attack was starting Hitler proclaimed to
the German people that it was necessary be-
cause the British forces in Greece (who were
helping the Greeks to defend themselves against
the Italians) represen|ed a British attempt to
extend the war to the Balkans. It is clear that
aggressive war against Greece and Yugoslavia
had long been in contemplation, certainly as
early as August of 1939.
Germany Turns on Russia
“On August 23, 1939, Germany signed the
non-aggression pact with the U.S.S.R. The
evidence has shown unmistakably that the Soviet
on its part conformed to the terms of this
pact. Nevertheless, as early as the late summer
of _ 1940 Germany began to make preparations
for an attack on the U.S.S.R. This operation
was planned under the code name ‘Case
Barbarossa,’ which was finally completed at
the beginning of November, 1940. The final
aims of the attack on the Soviet were formur
lated at a conference with Hitler on July 16,
1941, in which Goring, Keitel, Rosenberg and
Bormann participated.
“It was contended for the defendants that
the attack was justified because the Soviet was
contemplating an attack upon Germany. It
is impossible to believe that this view was
ever honestly entertained. The plans for
the economic exploitation of the U.S.S.R.,
for the removal of masses of the population,
for the murder of commissars and political
leaders, were all part of the carefully pre-
pared scheme launched on June 22 without
warning of any kind, and without the shadow
of legal excuse. It was plain aggression.
The U.S.'Next
“Four days after the attack launched by the
Japanese on Pearl Harbor Germany . declared
war on the U.S. The Tripartite Pact between
Germany, Italy and Japan had been signed on
September 27, 1940, and from that date Ribben-
trop, with other defendants, was endeavoring
to induce Japan to attack British possessions in
the Far East. « This, it was thought, would
hasten England’s defeat, and keep the U.S. out
of the war. The possibility of a direct attack
on the U.S. was considered and discussed as
a matter for the future. On April 4, 1941,
Hitler told Matsuoka that Germany would
‘strike without delay’ if a Japanese attack on
Singapore should lead to war between Japan
and the U.S. The next day Ribbentrop urged
Matsuoka to bring Japan into the war. In
November, 1941, Japanese representatives told
Germany and Italy that Japan was preparing to
attack the U.S., and asked for their support.
Germany and Italy agreed to do this, although
in the Tripartite Pact they had undertaken to
assist Japan only if she were attacked. When
the assault on Pearl Harbor did take place
Ribbentrop is reported to have been “over-
joyed,” and later, at a ceremony in Berlin
when a German medal was awarded to Oshima,
the Japanese Ambassador, Hitler indicated his
approval of the tactics which the Japanese had
.adopted of negotiating with the U.S. as long
as possible, and then striking hard without any
declaration of war.
Violation of Treaties
“It was urged on behalf of the defendants
that a fundamental principle of all law is that
there can be no punishment of crime without
a pre-existing law. It was submitted that no
sovereign Power had made aggressive war a
crime at the time the alleged criminal acts were
committed, that no statute had defined aggres-
sive war, that no penalty had been fixed for
its commission, and no court had been created
to try and punish offenders. To assert that it is
unjust to punish those who in defiance of treaties
and assurances have attacked neighboring States
without warning is obviously untrue, for in such
circumstances the attacker must know that he is
doing wrong, and so far from it being unjust to
punish him it would be unjust if his wrong
were allowed to go unpunished. Occupying
the positions they did in the government of
Germany, the defendants must have known of
the treaties signed by Germany outlawing re-
course to war for the settlement of inter-
national disputes; they must have known that
they were acting in defiance of all international
law when in complete deliberation they carried
out their designs of invasion and aggression.
“The General Treaty for the Renunciation
of War of August 27, 1928, more generally
known as the Kellogg-Briand Pact, was binding
on 63 nations,, including Germany, Italy and
Japan. , In the opinion of the Tribunal the
solemn renunciation of war as an instrument
of national policy necessarily involves the
proposition that such a war is illegal in inter-
national law; and that thdse who plan and wage
such a war are committing a crime.
“It was submitted on behalf of most of the
defendants that in doing what they did they
were acting under the orders of Hitler, and
therefore cannot be held responsible for the
acts committed by them in carrying out these
orders. The Charter specifically provides in
Article 8; ‘The fact that the defendant acted
pursuant to order of his Government or pf a
superior shall not free him from responsibility,
but may be considered in mitigation of punish-
ment.’ That a soldier was ordered to kill or
torture in violation of the international law of
war has never been recognised as a defence to
such acts of brutality.
“In the recital of the facts relating to aggres-
sive war, it is clear that planning and prepara-
tion had been carried out in the most systematic
way. That plans were made to wage wars as
early as November 5, 1937, is apparent. In
the opinion of the Tribunal, the evidence estab-
lishes the common planning to prepare and
wage war by certain of the defendants. The
argument that such common planning cannot
exist where there is complete dictatorship-js
unsound. A plan in the execution of which
a number of persons participate is still a plan,
even though conceived by only one of them;
and those who execute the plan do not avoid
responsibility by showing that they acted under
the direction of the man who conceived it.
Hitler could not make aggressive war by him-
self. He had to have the co-operation of
statesmen, military leaders, diplomats and busi-
nessmen. When they, with knowledge of his
aims, gave him their co-operation, they made
themselves parties to the plan he had initiated.
They are not to be deemed innocent because
Hitler made use of them, if they knew what
they were doing. The relation of leader and
follower does not preclude responsibility here
any more than it does in the comparable tyranny
of organised domestic crime.
War Crimes
“The evidence relating to war ‘crimes has
been overwhelming in volume and detail. It
is impossible adequately to review it. War crimes
were committed on a vast scale, never before
seen in the history of war. They were per-
petrated in all the countries occupied by
Germany, and on the high seas, and were
attended by every conceivable circumstance of
cruelty and horror. There can be no doubt
that the majority of them arose from the Nazi
concept of ‘total war,’ with which the
aggressive wars were waged. For in this con-
ception of ‘total war’ the moral ideas under-
lying the conventions which seek to make war
more humane are no longer regarded as having
force or validity. Everything is made sub-
ordinate to the overmastering dictates of war.
Rules, regulations, assurances, and treaties all
alike are of no moment; and so, freed from
the restraining influence of international law,
the aggressive war is conducted in the most
barbaric way. Accordingly, war crimes were
committed when and wherever the Fiihrer and
his close associates thought them to be advan-
tageous. They were for the most part the result
of cold and criminal calculation.
“On some occasions war crimes were de-
liberately planned long in advance. In the case
of the Soviet, the plunder of the territories to
be occupied, and the ill-treatment of the
civilian population, were settled in minute de-
tail before the attack was begun. Similarly,
when planning to exploit the inhabitants of
the occupied countries for slave .labor, the
German Government conceived it as an integral
part of the war economy, and planned and
organised this particular war crime down to the
last elaborate detail.
Prisoners Murdered
“Other war crimes, such as the murder of
prisoners-of-war who had escaped and been
recaptured, or the murder of Commandos or
captured airmen were the result of direct orders
circulated throUgh the highest official channels.
Prisoners-of-war were ill-treated and tortured
and murdered, not only in defiance of the
well-established rules of international law, but
in complete disregard of the elementary dictates
of humanity. Civilian populations in occupied
territories suffered the same fate. Whole popu-
lations were deported to Germany for the pur-
poses of slave labor. Hostages were taken
in large numbers from the civilian populations
in all the occupied countries, and were shot
as suited the German Public
and private property- was, systematically
plundered and pillaged in order to enlarge the
resources of Germany at the 1 -expense of the
rest of Europe. Cities and towns and villages
were wantonly destroyed without military jus-
tification or necessity. In the course of the
war m&ny Allied soldiers who had surrendered
to the Germans were shot immediately, often
as a matter of deliberate, calculated policy.
On October 18, 1942, Keitel circulated a direc-
tive which ordered that all members of Allied
Commando units, whether armed or not, were
to be ‘slaughtered to the last man,’ even if
they attempted to surrender. Under the pro-
visions of this order, Allied troops operating
independently lost their lives in Norway, France,
Czechoslovakia and Italy. Many of them were
killed on the spot, and in no case were those
who were executed later in concentration camps
ever given a trial of any kind.
“In March, 1944, 50 officers of the R.A.F.
who escaped from the camp at Sagan, where
they were confined as prisoners, were shot on
recapture, on the direct orders of Hitler. It
was not contended by the defendants that this
was other than plain murder, in complete
violation of international law. When Allied
airmen were forced to land in Germany they
were sometimes killed at once by the civilian
population. The police were instructed not to
interfere with these killings, and the Ministry
of Justice was informed that no one should be
prosecuted for taking part in them.
“The treatment of Soviet prisoners-of-war
was characterised by particular inhumanity.
The death of so many of them was not due
merely to the action of individual guards, or
to the exigencies of life in the camps. It was
the result of systematic plans to murder. More
than a month before the German invasion
of the Soviet Union the O.K.W. were making
special plans for dealing with political repre-
sentatives serving with the Soviet armed forces
who might be captured. One proposal was
that ‘political Commissars of the Army are
not recognised as prisoners-of-war, and arp
to be liquidated at the latest in the transient
prisoner-of-war camps.’ Keitel gave evidence
that instructions incorporating this proposal
were issued to the German Army.
“Soviet prisoners-of-war were left without
suitable clothing, the wounded without medical
care; they were starved, and in many cases
left to die. On July 17, 1941, the Gestapo
issued an order providing for the killing of all
Soviet prisoners who might be dangerous to
National-Socialism.
“Soviet prisoners were made the subject of
medical experiments of the most cruel and
inhuman kind. In July, 1943, experimental work
was begun in preparation for a campaign of
bacteriological warfare; Soviet prisoners were
used in these experiments, which more often
than not proved fatal.
“The argument in defence of the charge with
regard to the murder and ill-treatment of Soviet
prisoners, that the U.S.S.R. was not a party
to the Geneva Convention, is quite without
foundation. On September 15, 1941, Admiral
Canaris protested against the regulations for
the treatment of Soviet prisoners. He then
stated: ‘The Geneva Convention for the treat-
ment of prisoners is not binding between Ger-
many and the U.S.S.R. Therefore, only the
principles of general international law on {he
treatment of prisoners of war apply. Since the
eighteenth century these have gradually been
established along the lines that captivity is
neither revenge nor punishment* but solely pro-
tective custody, the only purpose of which is
to prevent the prisoners from further participa-
tion in the war. This principle was developed
in accordance with the view that it is contrary
to military tradition to kill or injure helpless
people... .The decrees . for the treatment of
Soviet prisoners are based on-a fundamentally
different viewpoint.’ This protest was ignored.
Keitel made a note on this memorandum;
GOERING: Death. HESS: Life.
The objections arise from the military concept
of chivalrous warfare. This is the destruction
of an ideology. therefore I approve and
back the measures.’
Civilians Exterminated
“The territories occupied by Germany were
administered in violation of the laws of war.
The evidence is quite overwhelming of a
systematic rule of violence, brutality and terror.
On December 7, 1941, Hitler issued the direc-
tive, known as the Night and Fog Decree,
under which persons who committed offences
against the German forces in occupied terri-
tories, except where the death sentence was
certain, were to be taken secretly to Germany
for trial or punishment. After these civilians
arrived in Germany no word of them was
permitted to reach the country from which they
came; even in cases when they died awaiting
trial, the families were not informed, the pur-
pose being to create anxiety in the minds of
the family of the arrested person.
“Hitler’s purpose was stated by Keitel in
a covering letter, dated December 12, 1941:
‘Efficient and enduring intimidation can only
be achieved either by capital punishment or
by measures by which the relatives of the
criminal and the population do not know the
fate of the criminal. This aim is achieved
when the criminal is transferred to Germany.’
“The brutal suppression of all opposition was
not confined to measures against suspected
members of resistance movements, but was
extended to their families. The practice of
keeping hostages to prevent and to punish any
form of civil disorder was resorted to. The
exact number of persons killed as a result of
this policy is not known, but large numbers
were killed in France and the other occupied
territories- in the West, while in the East the
slaughter was on an even more extensive
KEITEL: Death.
scale. In addition to
the killing of hostages
entire towns were de-
stroyed in some cases;
such massacres as
those of Oradour-sur-
Glane in France and
Lidice in Czecho-
slovakia are examples
of the organised use
of terror by the
occupying forces to
beat down and de j
stroy all opposition to
their rule.
“One of the most
notorious means of
terrorising the people
in occupied territories
was the use of con-
centration camps.
Their original purpose was to imprison without
trial all who were opposed to the Government.
In course of time concentration camps became
places of organised and systematic murder,
where millions of people were destroyed. A
number of the camps were equipped with gas
chambers for the wholesale destruction pf the
inmates, and with furnaces for the burning of
the bodies. Some of them were used for the
extermination of Jews as part of the ‘final-
solution’ of the Jewish problem.
“The murder and ill-treatment of civilian
populations reached its height in the treatment
of the citizens of the Soviet and Poland. In
an order issued by Keitel on July 23, 1941, and
drafted by Jodi, it was staled that: ‘ln view
of the vast size of the occupied areas in the
East, the forces available for establishing
security in these areas will be sufficient only if
all resistance is punished, not by legal prosecu-
tion of the guilty, but by the spreading of such
terror by the armed forces as is alone appro-
priate to eradicate every inclination to resist
among the population.’
“In Poland and the Soviet these crimes were
part of a plan to get rid of whole natiye
populations by expulsion and annihilation, in
order that their territory could be used for
colonisation by Germans. In Poland the in-
telligentsia had been marked down for ex-
termination as early as September, 1939, and
in May, 1940, Frank wrote in his diary of
‘taking advantage of the focussing of world
interest on the Western Front by wholesale
liquidation of thousands of Poles.’
Plunder and Exploitation
“The territories occupied were exploited for
the German war effort in the most ruthless
way, without consideration of the local economy,
and in consequence of a deliberate design and
policy. There was a systematic ‘plunder of
public and private property.’ The German
occupation policy was clearly stated in a speech
made by Goring on August 6, 1942, to the
various German authorities in charge of occu-
pied territories: ‘God knows, you are not sent
out there to work for the welfare of the people
in your charge, but to get the utmost out of
them, so that the German people can live.
That is what I expect of your exertions.. This
everlasting concern about foreign people must
cease now, once and for all. It makes no dif-
ference to me if you say that your people will
starve. It is necessary that all should know
that if there is to-be famine anywhere, it shall
in no case be in Germany.’
“The evidence establishes that the conscription
of labor was accomplished in many instances
by drastic and violent methods. Manhunts-
took place in the streets, at motion-picture
houses, even at churches and at night in private
houses. Houses were sometimes burnt down,
and the families taken as hostages, practices
which were described by the defendant Rosen-
berg as having their origin ‘in the blackest
periods of the slave trade.’
“Reference should also be made to the policy
which was in existence in Germany by the
summer of 1940, 'under which all aged, insane,
and incurable people, “useless eaters,” were
transferred to special institutions where they
were killed. It has been estimated that at
least 275,000 people were killed in this manner
in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums, which
were under the jurisdiction of the defendant
Frick. How many foreign workers were in-
cluded in this total it has been quite impos-
sible to determine.
Crimes Against Humanity
“The persecution of the Jews has been proved
in the greatest detail. It is a record of con-
sistent and systematic inhumanity on the
greatest scale. Ohlendorf, chief of Amt 111 in
the R.S.H.A. from 1939 to 1943, and who was
in command of one of the Einsatz groups in
the campaign against the Soviet Union, testified
as to the methods employed in the extermination
of the Jews. He said that he employed firing
squads to shoot the victims in order to lessen
the sense of individual guilt on the part of
his men; and the 90,000 men, women and
children who were murdered in one year by
his particular group were mostly Jews.
“In the summer of 1941 plans were made
for the ‘final solution’ of the Jewish question
in Europe. This meant the extermination of

ELECTION REFLECTIONS.
Except when the party or combination
in office has become desperately un-
popular, Commonwealth Ministers have
seldom lost their seats. In years when
Australians took their politics much more
seriously than they do now, the defeat
of two senior Ministers, in reversal of
immense majorities at the previous elec-
tion, and the narrow escape of a third
would assuredly have been accompanied
by the defeat of their party, and thus
followed by a change of Government.
The Chifley Administration has not only
survived the loss of its yM’my and Repat-
riation Ministers —in the circumstances a
grotesque comment on its claims that it
Saved the Country and would care for
the instruments of salvation as no other
party would or could —but can boast a
greater aggregation of votes in each
Chamber than the third Fisher Adminis-
tration had after the double dissolution
of 1914. Counting Ministers in, it will
have 43 pledged supporters in the House
and 32 or 33 in the Senate.
By all the rules of preferential voting
Mr. Scully, the Minister of Commerce
and Agriculture, should have shared the
fate of Mr, Forde and Mr. Frost. His
great absolute majority at the previous
election, 9072 in an effective poll of
47,736 (Mr. Forde’s was 6799 and Mr.
Frost’s 5191), vanished and he found him-
self nearly 1100 votes down on totals,
with only small parcels of preferences
to, be counted. He was saved by a capri-
cious and* utterly illogical distribution of
preferences. So were Mr. Langtry
(Riverina), Mr. McLeod (Wannon) and
Mr. Hadley (Lilley), In four other cases,
those of Comrades Lemmon (Forrest),
Haylen (Parkes), Conelan (Griffith) and
Barnard (Bass), the “Labor” majorities
were microscopic, and they were small
also in the electorates of Comrades Fuller
(Hume), Fraser (Eden-Monaro) and Wil-
liams (Robertson). Indeed, a very few
thousand votes made all the difference
between victory and defeat.
Nevertheless, “Labor” is entitled to say
that most of the people who didn’t spoil
their ballot papers were on its side, and
that it received a much greater measure
of support from young people voting for
the first time than the other side received.
This happens at every election, and It
is a matter for the Opposition to chew
over, and to alter by educational pro-
cesses —if it can. But the margin in
“Labor’s” favor was small, and it will be
over-represented in the House, having been
advantaged by an outmoded arrangement
of electoral boundaries, and grossly over-
represented in the Senate. In 1943, with
little more than half the effective votes,
it won 19 of the 36 Senate seats,
and in 1946, with reduced percentages
everywhere, it went very close to winning
the rest of the 36. Abolition of the
Senate is an old “Labor” aspiration, but
Australia will hear no more of it until
“Labor” loses its predominant position,
as it is sure to do some day, unless in
the meantime new States are. formed —
as they should be—or unless existing
States are divided for the election of
Senators into city and country sections,
with Proportional Representation.
The loss of Senators like Brand,
Leckie, McLeay, Collett, MacDonald and
Sampson—if Sampson goes out —will
severely impair the quality of the
Chamber. From July 1 onwards the
Senate will be given over in the main
to trade-union secretaries and organisers,
a lot of them stricken in years, who will
be merely dull echoes of Caucus deci-
sions, It looks like sinking below the
intellectual level of any of the State
Legislative Councils. A Senate in which
nearly half the people of N. S. Wales and
Victoria, States with not far short of five-
sevenths of the population, will be with-
out a voice will be a melancholy curios-
ity among deliberative Assemblies, so-
called, paralleled perhaps only in Soviet
Russia or in one of the minor Com-
munist Slav countries.
At the 1943 election there were nearly
half-a-million informal votes, and appa-
rently there were nearly as many on
September 28. And before referendum
counting had proceeded very far nearly
800,000 ballot papers had had to be dis-
carded. This adds up to an appalling
reflection on the intelligence of a great
part of the. population. Dr, Maloney,
a lifelong advocate of the initiative,
referendum and recall, would wring his
hands in despair if he could come back
to learn that the number of informal
referendum papers far exceeded the
majority for the social-services question
and. against “organised marketing” and
“employment in industry.” Excuses have
been found for the ignorant, careless and
oafish (many of the rejected ballot papers
bore pencilled inanities); they were
“nervous,” “flustered,” and so on. But
those who are punters, and doubtless a
great many are, would have been com-
posed enough, if racing had been the
test and not politics; they would not
have failed to mark “place-cards” in the
order of their preference. At the
same time it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the craze for
gambling, fed by racing-mad newspapers,
had a great deal to do with this dreadful
failure in the exercise of an ordinary duty
of citizenship; and the six education
systems, so often alleged to be “the finest
in the world,” obviously need attention.
Compulsory voting, though not obliga-
tory marking of preferences, should also
come up for judgment. If its only effect
is to bring ignorance, carelessness and
oafishness to the polls in vast numbers it
is due for abolition. Failure to vote
without a good excuse could be met with
disfranchisement, removed if the excuse
were valid; in other cases on payment
of a fine.
And very obviously there should be
a return to the two-party system. Appa-
rently it is not in the nature of English-
speaking peoples to stand more than two
parties for any length of time. There
are two only in New Zealand, the United
States and Canada; and, though the
Liberal party lingers in England, pre-
served in its decadence by memories of
Gladstone, Campbell-Bannerman and
Asquith, it is palpably approaching ex-
tinction.
In Australia three years ago we had
parties which called themselves One
Parliament for Australia, Liberal Demo-
crat, Services and Citizens and Christian
New Order and others with fancy names.
This year brought the Service party, the
Services party of Australia and the
Peoples’ Protestant party. All are gone
without hope of resurrection, and there is
no future for the Country party as an
independent organisation. It has long
ceased to exist in Tasmania and it is
patently on the downgrade in Westralia,
nor has it gained any ground in N, S.
Wales or Victoria. It certainly improved
its position in Queensland, but only as a
result of a friendly alliance with the
Liberals, who combined with the Country
party to run Mr. Davidson against Mr.
Forde in Capricornia—the Opposition’s
outstanding triumph. By all accounts,
Mr. Davidson supports an amalgamation
of Liberals and Country party such as
exists in South Australia, where a seat,
Wakefield, was gained by Mr. Mcßride.
Mr. Mcßride will join Mr, A. G.
Cameron, who was re-elected for Barker
by a commanding majority; and no die-
hard C.P. man could aver that these two
men would not be vigorous representa-
tives of country interests.
The C.P. leaders will have to reckon
with the fact that “Labor” has become
in the main a city party. From the
cities have come 26 of its 43 members
(Comrades Evatt, Sheehan, Rosevear,
Ward, Daly, Haylen, Falstein, Mulcahy,
O’Connor, Watkins, James, Brennan,
Drakeford, Calwell, Holloway, Scullin,
Lawson, Conelan, Hadley, Chambers,
Sheehy, Thompson, Burke, Bea’zley,
Gaha, Barnard), as well as the two inde-
pendent Labs., and most of the Senators,
whose votes were at least 70 p.c. city.
A combination of country members of
all parties against city Laborites on an
issue of importance to inland Australia,
if such a combination were conceivable,
would be hopelessly outvoted. Amal-
gamation, with a league on the South
Australian model, would set present C.P.
members free to work for the revival of
the New State movement, and in the
pass to which things have drifted that
has become one of Australia’s pressing
needs.
Diggers to Decide.
At their annual Federal Congress in Mel-
bourne next week Diggers of the R.S.L.
are to tackle one of the League’s most
awkward internal problems since the
founding of this great Australian insti-
tution in 1916. The question looks much
more simple than it is—whether member-
ship should continue to be restricted to
returned men of the various branches
of the forces or be made open
to include all who volunteered for over-
seas service.
The risk is that the decision could split
the League, which has held tightly to-
gether up to now, all through the years
doing Diggers and Australia an incom-
parable service. A majority of State
branches —N.S.W., Tasmania, Queensland
and Westralia—favor the change, but
Victoria is still against, and widespread
breakaways from the League have been
threatened.
The problem is not a new one; it has
been cropping up; but always shelved,
ever since the recent war got going. It is
one wholly for the Diggers themselves to
decide, but it has the point of public
interest that the League is a large group-
ing of ex-service civilian Australians
without sectional political color, and so a
big organisation that can be relied on to
put Australia’s interests first in all cir-
cumstances. It has so acted right
through, watching Digger interests, in-
dividual and collective, but being above
all for Australia. Hence any breaking
in its ranks would be damaging to both
Digger and national interests; on the
other hand, the increasing of its strength
that would follow if admission of all
volunteers could be smoothly arranged
should be of both Digger and national
advantage.
.It would be better left alone, as an
organisation of returned men, than
wrecked on this particular issue, because,
at the least, it is still strong enough as
it stands to serve its purposes fairly well.
Diggers who oppose the move for wider
membership hold that only those who
actually went overseas really demon-
strated their willingness to serve their
country. They hold that, in the circum-
stances of the recent war, many were
able to volunteer knowing quite Well that
they would never be called upon to go
outside Australia. They would admit
that there are exceptions, but not enough
of them to warrant risking any division
in the League. Anyway, they say, there
are plenty of organisations for those
others to get into: the League should be
kept what it has been all along—an
organisation of returned men.
Supporters of the move for widening
membership hold that the act of volun-
teering to serve overseas should be an
ample warrant. All those who volun-
teered could have been sent away, and
if the war had gone on the great bulk
of them would have been. These sup-
porters hold that there are a great many
more such volunteers than opponents of
of the move admit; enough to increase
the League’s strength and influence very
considerably. A good many of them
failed to get away through no fatilt of
their own, and all of them should be as
eligible for membership as militia who
did not volunteer, but who, nevertheless,
are eligible for membership by virtue of
having been sent away and being now
returned men.
A strong point in the case for admitting
all volunteers is that in the recent war
circumstances of Australia’s fighting part
underwent a vast change from what they
were in the war in which the League was
founded. In the first war, for one thing,
the A.I.F. was recruited and went abroad
to establish its bases and do its fighting.
The country itself was not directly
threatened ; there was no great industrial
support to be kept going and protected;
there was, moreover, a crying need be-
fore the end for far more reinforcements
than were forthcoming. Therefore, any-
one accepted as a volunteer was sure to
be sent abroad, and the only excuse for
anyone not going was that he was physi-
cally unfit.
All that changed from 1939 onwards.
In the later war Australia itself was for
a long time the main base. Consequently
there had to be a big holding of forces
for its protection, and, as well, the essen-
tial base jobs which in the other war were
done at a variety of addresses overseas
—qualifying those who did them for
R.S.L. membership without question—
in the recent war had to be done in Aus-
tralia. A great number of those doing
such jobs in Australia were volunteers,
and so were liable to be sent away at
any time, as they would have been if
the going had got tougher. Then it
would not have mattered where they did
their job; they could still have done it
much farther from the actual fighting
than they had been doing it in Australia,
but they would have been eligible for
the R.S.L.
The more it is looked into on the
practical grounds of how wars are fought
the stronger the case for admitting all
volunteers would seem to be. As every
Digger knows, overseas armies are not
made up of front-line fighting forces by
a long chalk. If the R.S.L. were re-
stricted to such forces it would be a
different matter; but the only qualifica-
tion is the word “returned,” and on that
basis a rough 50 per cent, of those back
from normal warfare would have been
supporting troops. As such, they would
certainly seem to amount to a strong
case for admitting any volunteers, especi-
ally as the great majority of these were
on jobs in Australia just as essential in
the general scheme of things as their
counterparts who happened to go over-
seas; with the condition always there.
also, that as volunteers they, too, would
be shipped overseas if required.
What appears to be a glaring incon-
sistency in the League in this regard is
that it has supported universal service.
To be consistent it should then open its
membership to all who have worn the
uniform; at least it cannot otherwise
speak in favor of universal service with
complete authority. There are other
points for consideration. One is that
Australia in the recent war went peril-
ously close to invasion, and if that had
happened all in uniform would have
been equally involved in what is the
basic essential of any war-fighting any-
where—the defence of the country, the
ensuring of its survival as a community,
the continuation of its preferred way of
life. In that event the word “returned”
would have lost all validity.
Another point is that if Australia
again gets into a war nothing could be
more certain than that it will be itself
attacked —and really attacked. In that
case there will be no room for survival
of such an undemocratic anachronism
as the volunteer system. The organising
on a long-range basis in preparation for
that possibility should be on the way
now; and, meanwhile, anything which
tends to perpetuate the outmoded volun-
teer system becomes a disservice to Aus-
tralia.
It is not to be expected that the R.S.L.
would open membership to all who have
worn the uniform, and as things stand
such a relaxation could so change it from
what it is as to destroy it. But some-
thing of the kind seems certain to hap-
pen eventually if another war comes
along, and it could be that the R.S.L.
would be that much more ready for it
if next week it is decided to accept all
volunteers, since that would mean drop-
ping the “returned” from its name.
Deciding the issue, however, is the R.S.L.
Diggers’ own affair, and it’s certainly
better to have the League as it is and
has been than to have any break in such
a noble body.
"Produce! Produce!"
A Federal Labor Government of an-
other day was prompted by calamity to
call upon Australians to “Produce! Pro-
duce,” a policy with which a Mr.
Moloney in particular concurred. Mr.
Moloney, Minister for Markets in the
Scullin Government, even exhorted Aus-
tralians to grow more wheat at a time
when wheat-production was flooding the
world; and in 1930-31 there were
18,164,920 acres under crop in the Com-
monwealth, from which 213,000,000
bushels was harvested.
Mr. Moloney is no longer in politics,
having been swept out in the 1931 elec-
tions ; but from his office of chairman of
the Victorian Dried Fruits Board he
must look more than occasionally over
the Australian economic scene and reflect
on the state of mind which prevails in the
Federal Labor Government of today—
a state of mind that seems to regard
mention of increased production as in-
discreet and emphasis upon economy in
public expenditure a political offence.
The days of glutted markets are no
longer with us, and there is a world de-
mand for almost everything Australia can
produce. Wheat, the Cinderella of com-
modities in depression days, is in an
aristocratic position ; it is worth at least
three times what it was when Australia
was suffering extreme exchange difficulties
and Lang and Ward were talking about
default. But, by comparison with the
great effort of wheatgrowers following
Parker Moloney’s appeal, in 1944-45 only
8,435,000 acres was put under crop, and
something like 11,500,000 acres in
1945-46. The most hopeful forecasts for
the 1946-47 season put total sowings at
a level far below those for 1930-31. The
present Government’s plans for “price
stabilisation,” of course, have been no
encouragement to the farmer.
Wheat is but one item in which we have
depression now—a production depression.
Many elements of trade-unionism are de-
liberately curtailing output in their in-
dustries. Some appear to be fearful of
what happens to jobs when overproduc-
tion hits an industry; but the majority
are using scarcity—particularly coal and
steel scarcity—as a political weapon, re-
gardless of the consequences upon their
fellow-citizens, or, in their blindly pig-
headed or apathetic manner, upon them-
selves.
In a condition of paper-money pros-
perity and production depression trade-
union elements are pulling the country
over backwards into another economic
bog. Whatever criticism there may have
been of Parker Moloney’s policy in the
1930’5, there is no doubt that “Produce!
Produce!” is a slogan for today. The
Canberra Government never seemed to
grow tired of talking “austerity” during
the war years. Why not an equal amount
of emphasis now, uninhibited and un-
ashamed, on the need for more output
from all sections of the community for
all sections of the community %


PLAIN ENGLISH
Hail the Golden Age!
Rosy gleams of the dawn of Mr. Chifley’s
Golden Age already appear the
horizon, though the election isn’t a
month old. Day by day since September
28 the gleams have brightened and the
final, blazing uprush of the climax seems
much nearer than even its most fervent
believers expected. Consider the evi-
dence, as viewed from one Australian
city, the largest:
Oct. 1: Tram men threaten strike.
Engineers boycott efforts to settle aircraft-
factory strike. Large unions decide on
campaign to burst wage-pegging regula-
tions. Chifley silent.
Oct. 3: Miners seek 35-hour week. Eighty
foundries face closure because of strikes.
Clerks declare wool “black.” Chif. silent.
Oct. 4: Wharfies threaten strike against
Saturday work. C. silent.
Oct. 5: Judge warns Victorian railway-
men against strike. Four N.S.W. coal-
mines idle. Aircraft-factory strike still on,
wool still “black,” Port Kembla strikers
ordered back to work. C. sil.
Oct. 7: One-day rail and tram strike in
Victoria. Threat of ditto in Sydney.
Clarey, of A.C.T.U., urges “action to avert
chaos.” McKell, Sydney Premier, predicts
50 years of “Labor” rule. C. s.
Oct. 8: Mine engineers and firemen de-
mand “penalty rates” or strike; 4500
foundry workers “threatened” with idle-
ness. C s
Oct. 9: Fifty thousand in N.S.W. in-
volved in “disputes.” Author of Golden
Age thanks “the people of Australia for a
renewal of confidence.”
Oct. 10: Flare-up on wage-pegging
threatened by Communist union-leaders.
General strike threatened in Victoria.
Author of G.A. falls silent again.
Oct. 11: Strike in Bathurst jail. Com-
munists shout that 400,000 workers demand
more money. Faction fight at Sydney
Labor Council. Seven mines idle. Silence
from Chif.
Oct. 12: A.C.T.U. demands 28s. 6d. a
week basic-wage rise at conference with
Golden Age inventor; G.A.I. silent.
Oct. 14: Tram and bus strike in Syd-
ney. Rail strikes threatened in N.Q. and
S.A. ' Unions reported to be organising
against wage-pegging. Chif. silent.
Oct. 15: Sydney tram and bus men
threaten another strike on November 11.
Dead silence.
Oct. 16: Wharves astir, milk-bottlers
“restive,” 20,000 engineers on strike, wool
ban spreads. Chif. tells A.C.T.U. Cabinet
will “consider” wage-pegging.
Oct. 17: Wharf strike ties up 57 ships
in Sydney; 13 mines idle for 10,620 tons
coal loss; woolbuyers stop operations;
Comrades Flanagan and Thornton, Com-
munist bosses of Ironworkers’ Union,
peeved with author of G.A., declare he
is “weak in the back and a tragedy as
P.M.,” and “workers will have to answer
with an equally stubborn insistence.”
Oct. 18: Mounting reports of “indus-
trial trouble” appear. Newcastle wool
sales abandoned, buyers go to Brisbane
but say they won’t bid unless assured of
shipping. W.A. wool sales may be aban-
doned. Sydney wharves idle. Riverstone
Meatworks likely to close. Another faction
fight at Sydney Labor Council. Chif. silent,
Ashley calls conference of wharf parties,
A.C.T.U. “appeals” to unionists not to
“precipitate stoppages.”
Oct. 19, 20, 21: Week ends with all signs
of major industrial upheaval. Week begins
with railway strikes in Vic. and S.A.,
repeat performance of Melbourne tram
strike, Sydney wharves idle, Mort’s Dock
to cease work, strike threat in Vic. steel-
and iron-foundries, Sydney tram and bus
men threaten another strike, inter-city
expresses cancelled and passengers stranded,
wool clerks’ strike extends, meat-workers
—but why go on? From Townsville round
to Adelaide the pattern becomes daily more
plain—with Chif. still silent.
Thus on the wings of the dawn comes the
Golden Age. And if anyone should
wonder why its author should have so
little to say and a strong inclination to
do even less, let him wonder no longer.
For with the 50 years of “Labor” rule so
confidently predicted, the author of the
Golden Age can sit enthroned at Can-
berra, surrounded by his disciples, and
leave the of the country to union
bosses, what time the hated capitalist
takes himself and his detestable money
elsewhere and the taxpayer goes humbly
to his hopeless end.
End at Nuremberg.
Always the dominant figure of the
Nuremberg trial, Goring held his place to
the end, going out the way of Himmler
by a phial of cyanide of potassium
crushed in his mouth a few hours before
he was to have been hanged.
The 10 others condemned as war crimi-
nals —Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, Keitel,
Jodi, Frick, Frank, Sauckel, Streicher,
Kaltenbrunner and Seyss-Inquart—were
dropped to their deaths in turn by an
American sergeant acting as hangman.
With the exception of Rosenberg, all
spoke a few last words on much the same
theme, expressed with most brevity by
Jodi: “I salute you, my Germany.”
Ribbentrop said:
My last wish is that Germany will find
her unity, that an alliance will be accom-
plished between the East and West, and
that peace will reign throughout the world.
The statement of Seyss-Inquart summed
up the whole purpose of the trial:
I hope this execution is the last act of
the tragedy of the Second World War,
and that the lessons of this World War
will make for peace and understanding
among peoples.
Whether that hope is to be realised is
for the future to uncover. The end of the
act coincided with the end of another act
in the drama of world affairs —the Paris
Peace Conference ; a squabble of nations
almost throughout; “unhappy to the
last” ; and ended with little done that
might inspire confidence in peace ever-
lasting, or even reasonably lasting.
At the best, it remains an armed peace,
conditioned in some quarters by fear of
what the other fellow might be capable of
doing. Real peace is still far off; still
demands supreme efforts of statesman-
ship to achieve it.
If nothing else, Nuremberg stands as
a grim warning. It will have been worth
while, as an alternative to executions
without trial, if its shadow acts as a
force in the peacemaking. That failing, it
could possibly still act as a deterrent to
a repetition of the horrible criminal acts
in war-time that were in some small part
expiated in the executions of the Nazi
Ten. Like examples have not worked out
that way in the past; and there must al-
ways be the strong probability that those
who launch another war will resort to
methods even worse, if possible, than
those of the Nazis, on the principle that
those who lose will be declared aggres-
sors and criminals, and strung up, any-
how.
It would be a rash prophet who would
attempt to say now what influence on
those lines, good or bad, Nuremberg will
have in the long run. It is not in the lap
of the gods, but in the hands of men;
and while Nuremberg continues to be
IN GOOD BEN CHIFLEY’S GOLDEN AGE.
“Following on jaunts abroad, at taxpayers’ expense, by Comrade Thornton and other
Communists, Comrade D. Thomson, secretary of the Victorian Building Trades Federation,
has been selected as one of the Australian delegates to a meeting of the International Labor
Office in Brussels on Nov. 25. Nomination of delegates was the responsibility of Minister
Holloway’s department—Labor and National Service.”
thought of as it is thought of now no
men will be able to say that they had not
the warning of a terrible example.
A Lucky Double.
The old saying Jhat it is better to be
bom lucky than rich applies to politicians
every whit as much as to those in less-
exalted positions. All parties are agreed
that the drawing of first-place on the
Senate ballot-paper is worth several
thousand votes, and that the possession of
a name starting with an early letter of
the alphabet may mean the difference
between defeat and victory in a closely-
contested seat.
T. F. Williams, “Labor” M.H.R. for
Robertson (N.S.W.), doesn’t possess this
advantage; but he’s had his share of
political luck. It first manifested itself
in 1943, when, on the nation-wide swing
to “Labor,” he won the Robertson seat
by 484 votes. His electorate is a hybrid
one—it reaches out from the fringe of
the metropolitan area into the fruit-
growing and dairying district along the
Hawkesbury and as far north as Single-
ton. At the recent Federal elections in-
dustrialisation in the near-city subdivisions
was expected to assist Williams, but a
swing against his party in the rural areas
meant that if he was to hold his seat he
would need a modicum of luck.
He got it. On polling-day the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” in publishing the “full
list of candidates,” omitted from the
Robertson starters the name of his prin-
cipal opponent, the Liberal man, *R. C.
Wheeler. The “Daily Telegraph’s” “full
list” included Wheeler, but omitted the
Country-party candidate, G. W. Watkins.
Possibly by September 28 Mr. Williams
was feeling fairly happy about his pros-
pects —the local paper in Gosford, a
Liberal strongpost in the heart of his
territory, had splashed one of his meet-
ings over four columns of its front page,
though it could find only a column on
an inside page for a meeting by Opposi-
tion-leader Menzies in support of Wheeler
—but this double slice of luck from
two city papers which editorially were
supporting his opponent must have
seemed like a gift from the gods.
Assuming that the god of chance had
decided that there should be a mistake
in one electorate in the “Herald’s” list
of candidates, the odds against Williams’s
electorate being the one chosen were 73
to one. In the case of the “Telegraph”
they were lower —27 to one —as that
paper published N.S.W. seats only. The
odds against bringing off the double event
were in the vicinity of 2000 to one, yet
Williams struck it. Lucky Williams!
"No Wrong" in No Preference
By a majority of four to one the Full
High Court upheld the judgment of a
Melbourne magistrate, the effect of which
was that the manager of a Commonwealth
munitions factory was immune from
action if he violated provisions of the
Dedman Re-establishment Act, because he
held a Crown position and “the King
can do no wrong.”
In the original case it had been shown
that, while a serviceman had been dis-
missed, a non-serviceman had been re-
tained. The judgment means that this can
be done with impunity in any concern
that can be represented as the Crown. It
means that, while the private employer
can be prosecuted and socked for violat-
ing the preference provisions, Govern-
ments cannot.
Dissenting from the judgment, Mr.
Justice Williams said that, in his opinion,
the reiteration in the Act in the definition
of “employer” was “intended to involve
the Crown up to the hilt.” There was no
indication in the Act, he contended, that
the Crown should be subjected to the
obligations of an employer but not held
liable to the expressed statutory remedies
for a breach.
Under the judgment, however, that is
precisely the position. It now remains
for Mr. Dedman to show whether his
high talk about the Act as the “Service-
men’s Charter” was honest or just so
much boloney. Failing such action, the
“Charter,” in this respect, will remain
merely a bad joke at the Diggers’ ex-
pense. Theirs is also the expense of the
High Court proceedings, costs having
been found against them.
No Excuse for Shoddy.
Packaging and quality of Australian-
manufactured goods exported to the
Middle East and the Orient are being
severely criticised, particularly by men
sent to those parts as trade representa-
tives. Last week Mr. C, L. Steele,
Trade Commissioner in Egypt, said some
Australian goods sent there were “so
poor that they must react unfavorably
on Australia’s permanent export trade,”
and Mr. A. Sparks, chairman of the
Export Development Group, said that
“far too many Australian traders were
shipping shoddily-packed and poor-
quality goods” to those markets.
Australians know only too well
that many goods for home consump-
tion are as badly made, of as poor
quality and as carelessly packed as any-
thing exported. But a country of high
wages, “full employment,” good work-
ing conditions and capable of producing
excellent raw material should refuse to
be satisfied with anything but the best,
and that applies to its exports.
Here, as with other things, it comes
back to the union-controlled Common-
wealth Government, which allows con-
tinual industrial strife and even
industrial blackmail to hamper the
efforts of everybody trying to pro-
duce goods, This country never
had, and is unlikely to have again,
such a great opportunity to establish a
flourishing export trade. That this oppor-
tunity is in danger of being lost is all
of a piece with our lost coal-export trade.
National Quiz.
Publicity for Commonwealth loans has
always been a sort of mixed grill.
Appeals to patriotism, emphasis on
saving and serving, exhortation to “back
the attack” and to “be a lender not a
spender” have been interlarded with dark
threats of inflation and attempts to cajole
and shame unwilling citizens into invest-
ing. Film publicity has usually been un-
inspired ; “loan marches” were at first im-
pressive, and parades of mechanical
equipment at least gave the public some
idea of what their money was needed
for; but street vaudeville turns and leg-
shows mainly appealed to bobby-soxers
of both sexes, who were unlikely to put
anything into the loan anyway.
Last word in futility was the use of
’planes and warships, with “free” rides,
to “advertise” loans. Possibly the idea
was that once a destroyer started buck-
ing the passengers would sign anything
in order to get back to dry land once
more.
For the Second Security Loan the
organisers struck a welcome new note.
Flying-boats and some of the other para-
phernalia of earlier loans are still pre-
sent, and a “grand display of fireworks,”
largely for the delectation of non-sub-
scribers, is promised; but with their
“national quiz” the sponsors picked a
winner.
The Loan publicity-men deserve full
credit for a rattling good idea. There
were a few blemishes, but these were
mostly errors for which the “experts” on
whom the promoters relied were respon-
sible. At the same time, as there
are to be further competitions, the
promoters should correct previous
mistakes and shortcomings. Each ques-
tion should be capable of only one
answer, and no multiple questions should
be included. More important still, if the
Quiz is to be a real test of general
knowledge, the element of chance should
be eliminated. This can only be
done by giving all contestants in any one
session the same questions. There are
ways in which this could be done without
undue waste of time and without sacrific-
ing listener-interest.
A Chance for Chifley.
Mr. Chifley’s offsiders, having received
a number of grateful letters from Eng-
lish pensioners who’d received Australian
gift-food parcels, promptly published a
selection of them. If Mr. Chifley is as
honest as he appears to be he must have
blushed.
His Government actually used Food
Control to stop a growing movement,
begun in Adelaide, to send more by
the voluntary surrender of food coupons.
The bitter words of the Adelaide
Mayor who launched the scheme,
when he learned that Mr. Dedman
had stopped it on the staggering grounds
that the Chifley Government’s food-
rationing scheme and its plans for selling
food to Britain were so perfect as to
make it unnecessary, would have stirred
any political party not steeped in callous
materialism:
It shows complete lack of appreciation
of the sentimental urge which has led to
this wonderful outpouring of goodwill to-
wards Britain, and completely overlooks,
the fact that food sent by the Common-
wealth Government is sold. What the
funds send is given. Buying and selling
are commerce; giving and receiving spring
from ties of sentiment and strengthen
them.
When Mr. White asked the P.M. if the
Government had acquired or sent any gift
food to Britain and if it would consider
a gift of £2,000,000-worth of meats, fats
and dairy produce, the answer to both
was a cold “No! ”
To their eternal credit Australians kept
on sending food. The spirit that the
Adelaide Mayor had referred to —Aus-
tralian generosity and sympathy for
a suffering kinsfolk and Australian
gratitude to a people who saved them-
selves and the world from tyranny,
at the same time never quibbling
about rising prices for Australian land
products —kept the stream of gift parcels
flowing.
The European winter is closing down
and much more food will be needed. The
Commonwealth Government, in receipt
of heavy tax revenues, and with uncol-
lected and unassessed taxation nearing
an astronomical figure, wouldn’t miss a
million-pound gift-food parcel to Britain.
It could thus remove a black mark
against itself. But perhaps such a gesture
would offend its Communist and other
friends never guilty of any love for
Britain.

POLITICAL POINTS
Another premeditated blow against in-
dustrial law and economic order was
struck by transport unions in Victoria
and South Australia at the beginning of
the week. Other unions looked like being
dragged into the Corn-inspired attack
on production, transport and financial
stability. The general demand is that
wages be unpegged, that “conditions” be
improved. There is no suggestion that
the Leftist unions visualise any “improve-
ment” other than more wages and a
shorter working period; no suggestion that
they have any plan to improve their own
or anyone else’s living standards. The
ominous picture of excessive money
savings and goods shortage does not deter
them in their merely aggravating de-
mands or prompt the offer of a greater
effort per man in return for “unpegging,”
etc. Economic chaos and industrial
breakdown in the United States seem
merely to egg them on. Marxism, not
Australianism or any semblance of it,
is behind the whole calculated attack.
And will Chifley, with a new Cabinet to
form and the National Security Act ex-
piring on December 31, bow to it or stand
up to it? Only one answer allowed, Quiz
Champeens!
McKell has had the gall to ask the
Commonwealth Government to meet the
losses on his city tram and bus services.
The mendicant Premier, as he has boasted
often, has had an unbroken succession
of surpluses, fruits of Commonwealth
expenditure on the carriage of troops
and troop supplies and on forms of
“social security,” previously charges on
N.S.W. revenue, whereas the Common-
wealth Government has had an unbroken
succession of war and post-war deficits
—the last was £153,000,000. In any case,
to suggest that taxpayers in five other
States should shell out because the
greediest and most inept of “Labor”
Administrations can’t make its trams and
buses pay is an outsize in chilled-steel
cheek.
When Sydney tram and bus men were
debating their silly one-day strike, a
couple of chaps laboring under the belief
that they were entitled to express their
opinions were howled down, the most
frequent advice being “Pull y’r skull in,
mug! ” Our masters are a bad-mannered
lot, and the larrikin now hunts in packs
as he did in the old days. The difference
is that he is now under Government
patronage.
There are always odd candidates at
Commonwealth ’ elections, among them
chaps who travel from State to State
cheerfully losing their deposits. The
oddest last month was a sporting charac-
ter whose leader had made a long and
tiring journey to speak for him at elec-
torate headquarters. Meeting the leader
for the first time, the sporting character
staggered that worthy by saying he him-
self had never made a speech in his life
and didn’t propose to make one as a
candidate. “But how on earth do you
propose to get in?” asked the astonished
chief. “Aw, well,” said the candidate,
shoving another fag into his mouth (he
is a chain cigarette smoker), “a lot of
the boys know me and me horses, and
I give them a winner occasionally. Gave
them a couple last week.” He didn’t
speak at the meeting—his leader, after a
powerful oration in his cause, being re-
duced to asking him to stand up and
show himself to the multitude. Strange
to say, he polled quite well, but not well
enough.
Ten months ago the “Labor” Whip in
the House at Canberra could muster 50
votes on a division without Rosevear, the
Speaker. By-election and general-election
results have reduced the number to 43,
still excluding Rosevear. On the other
side are 18 Liberals, 11 C.P. men and
two Independents, both of whom ousted
pledge-and-caucus men, with Liberal
support. Not so bad ; but it would have
been a lot better if the Sydney morning
press had come out against Haylen
(Parkes), Williams (Robertson), Fraser
(Eden-Monaro), Langtry (Riverina) and
Fuller (Hume) with something of the con-
stancy and courage shown by the Rock-
hampton paper published in Forde’s elec-
torate.
Except for a couple of years after the
double-dissolution of 1914, Victoria has
never been without a non-“ Labor”
Senator. From July 1, 1947, it will be
without one for at least three years unless
a vacancy occurs in the meantime and
Labor is in a minority in the Victorian
Parliament. Since July 1, 1941, N. S.
Wales has been without a non-“Labof’
Senator, and it looks like being without
one till June 30, 1950, at least. It seems
ridiculous, especially as the non-“ Labor”
vote in N. S. Wales and Victoria greatly
exceeds the “Labor” vote in South Aus-
tralia, Westralia and Tasmania, which will
have 18 Senators from July 1, 1947, on-
wards. But the whole Senate set-up has
become ridiculous. It was designed to be
a Chamber» of elder statesmen, and so
it was in the early Federal years. Now-
adays it has become a refuge for party
hacks, most of them of average parts
and some stricken in years.
It was Mountjoy’s misfortune in Swan
(W.A.) to come up against two returned
servicemen. One, Hamilton, the C.P.
man, served in both World Wars. The
other, Grayden, an Independent, who is
only 26, was with the A.I.F. in the Middle
East, New Guinea, Borneo and the
Celebes. A surprising number of his pref-
erences went to Mountjoy, but in the end
there was a majority of 242 for Hamilton.
The defeat of Mountjoy is a greater blow
to Communists than the loss of all their
deposits.
The Chifley crowd have put it out that
though Mr, Macmahon Ball, the British
Commonwealth representative in Japan,
had opposed the American representa-
tive, Mr. Acheson, and thus “found him-
self allied with the Russian representa-
tives, the alliance has been coincidental.”
There is little “coincidental” about the
Chifley crowd’s alliance with local
friends of Russia, the Communists.
The Chicago “Tribune’s” description of
Dr. Evatt’s Mr. Macmahon Ball, who
was little known in Australia till a year or
two ago save as an academic broad-
caster who told the world two days be-
fore Germany attacked Poland that
Hitler couldn’t fight because the Ger-
man workers wouldn’t let him:
A facile public speaker [who] became a
speech-writer and right-hand man of Dr.
Evatt and was given the Japan Council
as a political plum an obscure Labor-
party theorist who had thus, in one bound,
become an international figure.
The tale could be told with almost equal
truth of many Australian emissaries in the
world’s councils, as well as in the eco-
nomic sphere. It is a phenomenon which
puzzles other nations the more since men
like S. M. Bruce and R. G. Casey, world
figures through ability and wide experi-
ence, are passed over for them.
Drought, after decimating central- and
north-west N.S.W. wheat crops, is creep-
ing south into Riverina before the grain
can harden in the heads, and grasshoppers
threaten crops in N.S.W. and S.A. Two
droughts in three years have probably
cost the Commonwealth 35,000,000 sheep
and 50,000 beef and dairy cattle, losses
that will continue at least through next
lambing season. Yet the A.C.T.U. and
the “militant” unions are demanding up
to £2 a week wage increases and a general
shortening of the working week. In God’s
name, what has happened to the country?
When four men were sacked' from the
Murarrie (Q.) bacon factory early this
year the M.I.E.U. told its members that
the four had been wrongfully dismissed
and victimised and called a strike. The
strike spread to the State’s mines and
wharves, involved inter-State workers to
some extent, lasted from March 29 to
July 12 and directly and indirectly cost
unionists heavily in loss of wages. It
put the city of Brisbane on harsh light-
mg, power and transport restrictions and
generally involved Queensland in heavy
loss. Now the Industrial Court has found
that the men were neither wrongfully
dismissed nor victimised, and said of
the strike;
It was senseless It was a demand for
the complete control of engagement and
discharge of 1ab0r.... a Communist-
controlled strike in which decent men were
forced to suffer for their loyalty to
unionism
Clear grounds for proceedings against the
instigators of the strike ; but nothing will
be done because both the Commonwealth
and Queensland have “Labor” Govern-
ments, though both have anti-strike laws.
A Sydney businessman was studying
an official document when his eye fell
upon an abbreviation: “Com. Govt.”
Then he thought of the troubles that
surround us and murmured, “How apt,
how very apt.”
The McKells have “deferred” intro-
duction of their unwanted bill to amal-
gamate the Sydney municipalities into
“eight cities,” the good news being im-
parted to a Local Government conference
at Albury by the Minister, Mr. Cahill. If
the delegates were relieved it was nothing
to Cahill’s, relief. The bill’s sternest
opponent is the Mascot Council, and
Mascot is the heart of Cahill’s electorate.
In the words of Mr. Dunstan, former
Victorian Premier, Mr. J. J. Brown, secre-
tary of the Victorian branch of the
A.R.U., is “an avowed Communist.” Mr.
Brown, besides being secretary of the
branch, is also its returning officer, and
as such recently sent out ballot-papers to
all branch members inviting them to vote
“yes” or “no” on the following question;
Are you in favor of taking action, in-
cluding direct action if necessary, to win
the nine points programme drawn up by
the Railways Union?
Then followed the instruction: “Ballot-
papers must be signed, otherwise they
will be deemed informal and disallowed,”
with a dotted line for signature. All, of
course, in keeping with conditions await-
ing us in the Golden Age.
A minute or two after Heath, an
English brute convicted of the sadistic
murder of one woman and guilty in at
least one similar case, was hanged, a
wealthy and sentimental female cam-
paigner against capital punishment began
scattering leaflets. She was fined £2 for
obstruction. In N.S.W. a man found
guilty of murder or rape in its grossest
form needn’t fear the rope, the “yoo-
manitarians” of Labor having abolished
the death penalty.
“When your duties permit, come and
see Tokyo,” wrote MacArthur in a letter
to Calwell. But wouldn’t the gentleman
rather go to Tel-Aviv?
Ex-Premier Mair, who came out for
the Senate without success, is not stand-
ing again for Albury, whose M.L.A. he
has been since 1932. Retirement means
that he may, if he chooses, claim £5
a week for life under “Labor’s” Assembly
Pensions Act, with a reversion of £3
a week for his widow. And there seems
nothing to prevent Lang, as an M.L.A.
since 1913, with a short break in 1943,
putting in for £6 a Hveek for life. A
Commonwealth member (Mrs. Lyons, for
example) can’t draw a Commonwealth
pension as well as Parliamentary pay,
but the disqualification set out in Section
43 does not apply to State pensions,
which are not, in fact, mentioned. Appli-
cation for the £5 or £6 a week .is not
likely in either case, especially as both
men voted against “Labor’s” pensions
measure; but this does not affect its
infamous character.
McPhee, the one Premier who didn’t
lose his job during the depression, is
retiring from Tasmanian politics. One
of the members for Franklin in the now-
expiring Assembly, he is standing down
for a younger man, having turned 00.
Baker and Marriot had previously
announced their impending retirement,
and Soundy has transferred to the other
shop,” so that the Liberals in the next
Parliament will be for the most part a
new team. They have an energetic leader
in Neil Campbell and hope to see him
become Premier.
Tasmania is to liave a State election
next month. State and Federal electo-
rates are identical, and if Federal voting
is repeated there will be very little be-
tween the parties, though it rarely works
out that way. D’Alton, who was Cos-
grove’s Deputy Premier, is reported to
be toying with the notion of coming out
for Darwin. This will be to the taste of
the Opposition, which in any case will
make the administration of the Forestry
Department its best bet.
Immigrant building tradesmen are
scheduled to sail for Australia as from
November 11 at the rate of 150 a month.
A shining example of the manner in
which Australia is helping Britain in its
tribulations. Building laborers, it is
cabled, downed tools on a Glasgow hous-
ing site to meet Australian Government
representatives offering them free priority
passages and good jobs at £7 7s. a week
in Canberra. Britain, bombed to pieces,
needs housing this winter as a
matter of life and death, and Australia
has plenty of bricklayers provided the
unions will let them do a decent day’s
work. In Sydney the average day’s laying
is under 400 ; in Adelaide, where there is
no real shortage of building labor, 800.
Metropolitan Liberals in Victoria are
brooding on the Commonwealth-election
figures. Whereas Menzies substantially
increased his majority in Kooyong, Gul-
lett’s slumped in Henty and those of
White (Balaclava), Hutchinson (Deakin)
and Holt (Fawkner) were scarcely any
better than in 1943 and very much less
than in 1940. Senators Brand, Leckie and
Fraser looked to these electorates to off-
set the Labor majorities in Melbourne
Ports, Bourke and Batman, and they are
wondering what happened, especially as
country electorates like Bendigo, Gipps-
land and Wimmera surpassed their ex-
pectations. The chances are that the
party’s support for compulsory training,
warranted as it was, and is, acted like a
cold douche on middle-class Melbourne
parents.
A Mr. A. D. Clark, of Brisbane, is
seeking permission for 10,000 “White”
Russians to enter Australia as immigrants.
These people have been living in China
since the Russian revolution of 1917 and
are inflexibly opposed to Communism.
According to their sponsor they fear
enslavement or death if Communism
triumphs in China. Any day now we
can expect the local Commos to set up a
savage howling against them.
A London gasworks employee named
Couzens walked 1000 miles around an
Essex stadium in 335 hours, with brief
stops and 15-minute naps. He proposes
to walk for 1000 hours to see how far
he can go in that time. Possibly he
intends to emigrate to Sydney or Mel-
bourne and is in training against the
usual transport paralysis.
These Communists aren’t at all hesi-
tant about grabbing the best Capitalism
can give ’em when they go a-jaunting.
Messrs, Molotov and Vishinsky, travel-
ling to the U.S.W to attend U.N.O. meet-
ings, went in the best suites aboard Queen
Elizabeth, attended by flunkeys and
guards galore. In New York they will
live —among workers down in the
Bowery? No ; they’re going to shake-
down in a 50-room, million-dollar man-
sion on Long Island.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“Clooter”: We are about to be eye-
bashed as well as earbashed by a herd of
so-called “commentators” and “writers”
who will follow the England cricket
team and record everything it does, says,
eats, wears and dates, seeing dark plots
in the lift of a skipper’s eyebrow and
menace in the gurgle of a tired bowler
downing a schooner. Particularly weari-
some will be the blitherings of former
“star” cricketers who have been hired by
newspapers to “report” the matches,
giving rewrite men and sub-editors bad
dreams and the English language a
thorough mauling. I have never dis-
covered by what process of reasoning
the newspaper heads conclude that the
public would sooner read the drivel of
“Bighitter, ex-Test batsman,” than the
clear report of a practised journalist. On
the same line of reasoning, all big crime
stories should be reported by a prominent
ex-detective —in N.S.W. it shouldn’t be
hard to get a released murderer to do
the juicy murders, since convicted mur-
derers are never hanged in that enlight-
ened State—society weddings by fashion-
able divorcees and Parliament by poli-
ticians.
* # * *
“T.McN.”: As an old newspaper re-
porter it always embitters me to read
sporting stories sold to the public as
written by people who have been out-
standing performers in their particular
sport. The public, bless it, seldom sus-
pects the job done by unknown news-
papermen in making the thing readable.
Which reminds me of a former cricket
“star,” a decent fellow and a splendid
player, who was paid a large sum by a
newspaper to write up a series of Tests.
Stuck with a problem of punctuation, he
asked a friendly reporter whether he
should use a period or a comma. The
reporter eyed the copy, suppressed a
desire to advise him to use a match, and
replied that a semicolon was called for.
“What’s that?” demanded the cricketer.
And, carefully and slowly, the reporter
drew the figure for him.
* * * *
“Zake”: Sydney and Paris are the
diametrical opposites when it comes to
politeness—and not only in the streets.
The male Parisian will gallantly step into
the gutter that an old lady may have
footpath-way. Young Sydney men hurl
old women aside in their mad peak-hour
rush for seats. But in the concert hall
the opposite is the case. I put forward
the recent premiere in Sydney of Stra-
vinsky’s “Rite of Spring” as an example.
The audience not only sat silent through
the awful, unmusical mess, which con-
tains not a bar of true melody in its
exorbitant length, but actually politely
clapped when they were at last released
from their agony. At its premiere at the
Champs-Eiysees Theatre in Paris catcalls
and whistles started after only a few
bars had been played and within minutes
the house was in uproar. Saint-Saens
denounced the composer as a faker, while
the Austrian Ambassador stood up and
laughed in loud derision; a Princess rose
and proclaimed fiercely that she had been
made a fool of. A young man beat a
tattoo on a critic’s head while a lady
slapped a man who was hissing loudly.
Ravel and Claude Debussy, on the other
hand, cried out that the work was that of
a genius, and pleaded for a hearing. But
the orchestra was drowned in the babel
of protests, angry calls and shrieks. If
only someone had stood up at Sydney
Town Hall during a break in the per-
formance and given one vibrant rasp-
berry our fair city may have restored its
reputation.
* * * *
“Old Bill”: Recently I went to a
wedding and when, a few days later, a
neat little packet addressed in the hand-
writing of the bridegroom arrived I con-
cluded it contained wedding-cake. I’m
no cake-eater, so I tossed the packet on
the typist’s desk, saying “There’s some-
thing to go with your morning tea,” and
left the office on a fruitless search for
tobacco. When I got back the lass said
with a beaming smile, “Thanks for the
present. It was a windfall.” “That’s
0.K.,” I told her grandly, “I don’t care
for cake.” “Cake!” said the girl. “I’m
thanking you for the two packets of
smokes you gave me.”

“G. Mech.”; I was one of the radar
trainees that Tich (B. 9/10/’46) “felled
in.” The only English radar the R.A.A.F.
held at that time was housed in a closely-
guarded hut, and a triple-signature pass
was required for admittance. Came the
. .Yours faithfully, the Ready-built Scaffolding Co”
day when Tich prepared to demonstrate
the huge transmitter. Switching on in-
volved a number of operations which
were laboriously explained. The final
act was to press a button which connected
about 20,000 volts to the equipment.
Simultaneously with Tich pressing the
button there sounded the most agonising
howl I’ve ever heard. For a moment
the class thought Tich was the victim;
then from the complicated innards of
the equipment a large grey-and-black cat
shot forth snarling, spitting and scream-
ing. The door was 15 yards away, but
I’ll swear the cat didn’t touch the floor
as it streaked through and disappeared
for ever. When Tich came to we had a
hard job convincing him that he hadn’t
electrocuted a spy hidden in the works.

“Galenus”: A curious and hitherto
unexplained feature of cancer mortality
is the marked preponderance of cases
involving the mouth, throat and lungs
amongst men as compared with women.
In the latest available figures for Aus-
tralia (1944) they numbered 617 and 174
respectively, a ratio of more than three
and a half to one. For the last pre-war
year, 1938, the proportion was a little
over five to one, rising in the case of
mouth and throat cancers to six and a
half to one. Similar differences occur in
Britain and the United States, and, as in
Australia, the incidence amongst women
appears to be rising steadily. An Ameri-
can surgeon has suggested that the rise
may be connected with the great increase
in smoking by women and that in time
they may suffer equally with men. But,
after all, his statement may be only a
wily move for reducing feminine com-
petition for depleted tobacco supplies.
* * * sic
“Wandana”: Doing a spot of clean-
ing-up the other day I came across a
cardboard box on the cover of which was
a florist’s label with a “Postage 50 p.c.
extra paid” ticket attached, addressed to
“Mrs. Bland Holt, Craig’s Hotel, Bal-
larat.” The bouquet has gone the way
of all flowers, but the Bland Holt
memories linger. I recall the lesser lights
of the stage who toured country halls —
Maurice Gerald, Dan Barry, Madame
Greenwood and her company and
many others, introducing us to “East
Lynne” and (occasionally) a bit of
Shakspearian stuff. But it was generally
the “mixed” companies that got the best
houses in the country towns —the Lynch
Family Bellringers, the Corricks, with
their bellringing and vocal programmes,
the Fisk Jubilee Singers (all negro) and
the Steele-Payne Family Entertainers.
Sets of the old handbells are still about
—I had some offered me during war-
time for a soldiers’ recreation hut by
relatives of one of the forenamed—
but the art of ringing seems to have died
out.
* * * *
“Wewak”; City slickers who make the
country people the butt of a lot of jests
by their expression “Do you think I
come from the bush?” or “What d’you
think it is—bush week?” would be sur-
prised to hear the joke in reverse in New
Guinea. When a native approaches a
returning civilian with some impossible
request or suggestion the reply is “Wat
naim, yu tink nau tasal mi kum Sidni?”
(“What, do you think I’ve just come
from Sydney?”)
* * * *
“Passun”; After 12 months’ captivity
the Roan Steer was the only man in the
prison camp unbashed. He put it
down to understanding Jap psychology ;
actually he’d just been lucky. But his
day came when a Jap colonel was in-
specting the officers’ quarters. He saw
the Roan Steer standing correctly at at-
tention and lammed into him, jack-boots
and fists. Of course the Old Man had to
find out why the inoffensive one had been
punished. The Jap interpreter explained
that the Chusa had simply said, “No
prisoner of Nippon has any right to look
as superior as that red-haired Australian
officer.” As if any man could hope to
understand the mind of a Jap!
■■* * * *
“Penelope’s Mate”: Affectionately
known as “Chewing-gum Charlie,” our
Ambon padre was serenely fearless.
After much labor he succeeded in making
a respectable garden outside the wire,
and produced on a plant six rosy-red
tomatoes. He was greatly distressed
when he climbed the hill one morning
to find that his fruit had gone. His
spirit had always impressed the Japs, and
that evening the Commandant called
him to his house for tea and conversa-
tion. The padre went, Bible and all, was
smilingly welcomed and told to sit. He
didn’t get as far as that. There on the
table, together with other good things,
were six rosy-red tomatoes. The good
man calmly reached out, put them down
his shirt-front, snorted at the dumb-
founded Japs and marched out.
* * * *
“Jasby”: Hansard is not as a rule
looked upon as a source-book for Aus-
tralian slang, but a recent issue of S.A.
Parliamentary Debates placed a new word
on record. The Chief Secretary tabled a
police report on offences in parklands,
which included a reference to the activi-
ties of “gliders,” and went on to define
a glider as “an individual who crawls on
his stomach, uses a long piece of wire with
a hook end, and approaches couples
whilst they are reclining on the lawns
when their attention is otherwise diverted.
By the use of the piece of wire he is able
to secure the woman’s handbag.” The
report detailed precautions taken by the
police to meet this menace and concluded
on a regretful note: “The difficulty the
police have to contend with is that couples
seek the most secluded places and are
often so hidden from the view of the pat-
rolling police that it is difficult to know
they are there. The prowler, who is ever
on the watch, is aware of this.”
* * * *•
“Arthur Itis”: Pacific War Yanks may
not have used “doover” (B. 9 /10/’46),
but I heard it in 1922 used by a Vic-
torian just returned after ten years in
’Frisco. A companion word was “duf-
lick.” He regarded both words, mean-
ing gadget, as American.
* * * *
“Wirriba”: Early this month a little
ceremony took place between Dent Light-
house and Long Island, Whitsunday Pas-
sage. The Lighthouse steamer stopped
while the ashes of her late master were
scattered over the waters. His will was
that his body be cremated and his ashes
strewn there. I don’t blame him. There
could be no more beautiful place to go
to meet the gods. The late Captain Firth,
Canberra, had a pleasant habit during the
tourist season. He would bring his ship
up the Passage, round Spion Kop, on
South Molle, swing into Lamond’s Bay,
turn to starboard, take a circle and go
back round Roma Point, proceeding north
up Molle Channel. Asked why, he once
replied: “Well, I don’t think it fair to
bring people all the way from Melbourne
without giving them a double view of the
most beautiful spot on the whole of the
eastern Australian coastline.” That is
where Captain Fields chose to have his
rest.
* * * *
“Curate’s Egg”: With the return of
normal conditions to Thursday Island
I hope the northern outpost will
again become the H.Q. of the
Torres Straits pilots. Passen-
gers on the Australian-Oriental
runs often wondered at the
identity of the bleary-eyed
stranger who made a sudden
appearance at the captain’s table
some days out from T.I. The
stranger was the Torres Straits
pilot. His haggard appearance
was due to some 48 hours’ un-
broken stretch on the bridge.
On him devolved the bringing
of the craft through the reef-
studded labyrinth in which the
Quetta foundered. The policy
of the traditionally silent service
prevented public acknowledg-
ment of the part played by the
association’s members during the
early stages of the Nip war.
Long-retired members disgorged
the anchor when the Navy called
for pilots for the convoys. One
had his craft sunk under him
three times' after his third
emergence from “retirement.”
* * *
“Henry”: Some coves are
gluttons for unpaid labor. My
neighbor is - an example. He’s
hon. sec. of the local progress
association, a friendly society, a
hospital auxiliary and a parents’ and
citizens’ association. He looks after the
cash for a sailing club and a children’s
library. As president he takes the chair
at meetings of the district cricket club, a
local political organisation and a horti-
cultural society, and he is on the com-
mittees of a professional organisation, a
debating society and a school of arts,
besides auditing the books for a Metho-
dist Church and several charitable shows.
Strangely, he has no political ambitions,
nor does he seek election to our municipal
council. We have attempted to persuade
him to stand for Parliament or for
aldermanic honors, but he always reso-
lutely refuses. “Those jobs are all right,”
he told me, “but the trouble with them
is that a man is at the beck and call of
everybody.” A week later he became
honorary organiser of a Queen compe-
tition and carnival for a war-memorial
centre.
* * * *
“Beechworth”: Away back in 1900 a
woman at Beechworth (Vic.) buried a
bottle of whisky. A big bushfire was
approaching the homestead, the house-
hold articles were removed, and she
buried the grog for safety. It was safe
all right; it took the family 46 years
to find it. A few weeks ago it was dug
up in the homestead garden. Those who
should be in the best position to know
reported it was in good condition.

“Bozo”: At a suburban picture theatre
the sweet young thing in front of me
was thoroughly enjoying the show, paus-
ing between giggles to dip into a box
of sweets. Suddenly she gave a startled
squeak and grabbed at the box. There
was a frantic wriggling and rustling, which
subsided under the disapproving glares
of patrons around her. Shortly after-
wards the lights went up and the girl
signalled an usher. “What will I do
with this?” she asked, waving an untidy
paper parcel under his nose. “It’s a
mouse—a live one!” What a gal!
THE INFORMAL VOTER.
“Mr. Turner, Chief Cdhimon wealth Returning
Officer, commenting on the fact that there were over
300.000 informal votes for the Senate and over
800.000 for the Referendum questions, said that many
people were nervous when they went into a polling
booth and lost their heads under the emotional strain
of filling up ballot papers.”
It isn’t that they lack the requisitions
For exercising their undoubted right,
Capacity for making brisk decisions
And setting numbers down in black and
white.
Elsewhere they might be trusted quite securely
At the correct conclusion to arrive
That two and two make four, and just as surely
How many beans make five.
But here their bloomers —lawyers call them
laches —
When yarded willy-nilly to the polls
Are testimony to what strain attaches
Thereto, what stress is laid upon their souls.
They come to know the franchise has its bitters
As well as sweets in these enlightened days,
And get what’s usually dubbed “the jitters”
In our colloquial phrase.
Called on to indicate their preferences
For anybody or for anything,
They find (we’ve Mr. Turner’s word) their senses
All of a whirl, their wits wool-gathering.
The burden laid upon them, he’s a notion.
Something too heavy to be born denotes,
And hence, through uncontrollable emotion,
They throw away their votes.
The very consciousness of their intrusion
Into the rivalries of Labs and Libs
Occasions them, it seems, as much confusion
As might a weighty wollop in the ribs.
In wavering hands, sure signs of mental friction,
The wayward pencil regulations mocks;
In short, they lose their heads. In vulgar diction
We’d term it “do their blocks.”

“V. Cluse”: Jephson, stranded in
Sydney by the tram strike, had a half-
hour to wait for a friend who had
promised to convey him home by car, so
he took a stroll around the locality of
his office. It was a hot and sticky day,
which added to the irritable mood into
which the silly strike had thrown Jeph-
son, and he decided that a drink would
be useful. Coming out, somewhat re-
freshed, he stood a moment outside the
hotel and was approached by a seedy
individual who whined, “Listen, pal, be
a sport, will y’? Me wife’s crook out in
St. Vincent’s ’orspital an’ I need me
tram-fare out an’ back.” Jephson had
actually begun to fish in his pocket for
a zack when the strange silence of the
streets struck him. “Wake up to your-
self, old chap,” he said. “There’s a
tram strike on.” The earbiter bridled.
“What’s that got t’ do with it?” he de-
manded. “Strike me, y’ can’t stop every-
thin’ jist because the bloomin’ trammies
is on strike, can y’! ” The flabbergasted
Jephson handed him a deener.

“Findy”; As a some-time neighbor to
the stepson of a knight banneret’s de-
ceased wife’s sister I am moved to protest
against the lamentable lack of knowledge
of the English peerage displayed by the
persons who set the questions in the
National Quiz. The query posed was
this: “The wife of a knight is nowadays
popularly called lady. Legally, however,
she bears another designation. What is
it?” When the competitor admitted his
ignorance the quiz-master showed'his by
stating that the correct reply was “Dame,”
He might just as well have said that the
seventh son of a seventh son was legally
entitled to be addressed as Dogsbody. I
won’t quote my Uncle Oliver, who once
sat next to a bogus peer at an all-night
coffee stall, or my Aunt Ermyntrude, who,
six years ago, scrounged an invitation to
the Lord Mayor’s Ball, but will content
myself with the lesser authority of
Whitaker’s Peerage, which dismisses the
subject thus: “Wherever in the Knightage
“ Don't look now, but I think Were being swallowed.”
the husband is styled ‘Sir’ the wife, in
conventional usage, has the title ‘Lady’
or ‘Dame’ as in the case of a Baroness,
But in both cases the honor is one of
courtesy and not of right.” Courtesy
only, mark you, and I doubt whether even
courtesy would entitle the wife of a quiz-
master to be referred to as a quiz-mistress,

“Obelist”: I took home a novel from
a circulating library and became absorbed
in the story. Presently it went haywire:
pages 59 to 90 were missing, though by
way of compensation pages 91 to 122
were duplicated. The flyleaf showed that
the book had been on the library list for
two months, and according to the date
stamps I was the tenth reader. When I
returned the volume I asked the librarian
whether he had received any complaints.
On the contrary, nearly all my prede-
cessors had expressed satisfaction and
thought it a rattling good yarn. He told
me that although this was an extreme case
it was not unusual for a book with a few
pages missing or misplaced to go through
its career without a single reproach. No-
thing less than a few blank pages in the
printed body was capable of bringing a
reaction!

“B. A. Ker”: I can’t raise any sym-
pathy for “Bo’s” diner in his struggles
with a sauce bottle (B. 18/9/’46); until
he has tried to remove a pickled onion
from its habitat no man has really lived
The onion is selected in the factory so
that its circumference is slightly larger
than the mouth of the bottle; the glass
is then blown round the fragrant vege-
table. The saving effected in boarding-
houses by this device must run into mil-
lions. For years a veteran graced our
hash-house table, although his hide was
riddled with scars from a thousand forks.
Towards the end only impetuous new-
chums were foolhardy enough to cross
forks with him. He went down in
glorious defeat when an unprincipled lout
quartered him with a carving knife.

Interest evoked by last
season’s Sydney-Hobart yacht race and
the decision to conduct another one this
summer suggest that ocean racing is here
to stay. The prospectus for the race issued
by the Cruising Yacht Club of Australia is
causing concern among some Tasmanian
entrants; it makes no provision for the
compulsory sealing of engines. In con-
sequence, at least one competitor may
withdraw. And at least one landlubber
is wondering what has happened to the
spirit of trust and fair play once associ-
ated with Australian sport.

“Colonel Bungstarter”: Sociologists
are speculating as to the real cause of
the chronic irritability prevalent amongst
Australian men. Yet it is plain enough
to any observer who takes the trouble
to register his own reactions when dress-
ing or after stretching up to put the
bottle back in its hideout on top of the
wardrobe. Austerity clothing restrictions
still insist on shirts being five inches
shorter than they should be for comfort,
and there is nothing more irritating than
a shirt-tail rucked up towards waist-level.
A generation ago “Dicken to you and yer
short shirt” was a term expressing utter
contempt. One of Hitler’s first moves
toward making Germany really war-
minded was to shorten shirt-tails.
* * * *
“Wippegong”: Those Jap name-stamps
taken by “Bondi Beachcomber” and his
cobbers (B. 25/9/’46) were the cheap
ones, but it doesn’t necessarily follow that
the regular use of a name-stamp indi-
cates illiteracy. Above the bamboo seals
come the bone ones, then ivory, then
crystal, agate, and similar semi-precious
materials which, in themselves, are
lovely things. Names are beautifully
carved on the bases, and, as these may be
for merchants or big shots, the sealmaker
must register a copy of each with the
bank and with the police, for the seal
alone on a cheque or agreement is bind-
ing. I scrawled my initials on a piece of
paper, a polite nod signified that the
contract was accepted, and next day col-
lected a perfect reproduction, in minia-
ture, on fine bone. The sign of the
sealmaker’s shop is a small glass tray,
suspended within the window, and carry-
ing specimens of solid cylinders and
blocks from which seals may be cut.
These usually include one or more of a
quality higher than the tradesman ex-
pects to sell; often family heirlooms and
not for sale.

“Pitt St.”: The girl in the tram (it was
one of those days in Sydney when the
trams were running) was reading the
magazine supplement of a morning daily
and I couldn’t help reading the introduc-
“ Oh, my dear, that spaghetti DOES make an exquisite coiffure”
tory line of an article about roof-gardens
in the city. “High above the pavements
in down-town Sydney,” it began, and I
want to know whatinell is “down-town
Sydney.” I suspect that even the writer
doesn’t know, he or she being too ready
to imitate those Americans who write of
down-town New York, which means the
busy part of the city. The part of Sydney
wherein is situated the roof-garden
alluded to is far from that, by compari-
son, and it isn’t even “down” from that
jiewspaper’s offices, being definitely up-
Tiill, Still, this form of journal-
istic snobbery is becoming so rife that any
day now I expect to read of “cross-town
Sydney” or “the millionaire belt” and
find the shadowy streets around King’s
Cross called the “tenderloin district.” i

“Wollumbin”: Elastic-sided boots may
be “Bespoke Romeos” in “Tip’s” part of
the world (B. 9/10/’46), but in western
Queensland, where every stockman wears
them, I’ve never heard them called any-
thing else but “Laughing Sides.” Apart
from the regulation military boot, they
are the most comfortable footwear I’ve
ever experienced.
* * ♦ «
“Balgowlah”: Although my Christian
name is as common as promises at elec-
tion-time, only four or five families in
Australia share my surname. When an
unfortunate young fellow bearing the
same Christian and surname as myself was
killed in a accident recently
it was immediately presumed by many
friends and acquaintances that I had gone
west. My family received messages of
condolence, friends rang other friends to
find out the time of my funeral and when
I walked into my usual pub I was re-
ceived as if I had risen from the dead.
Yet the man who was killed was single,
was 12 years younger than I am, lived in
a suburb far removed from mine and
was riding a motor-cycle, a contraption
on which I have never been seen. All
of which shows how many people read
their papers with one eye shut. Or was
it wishful thinking?
♦ * * *
“Tackline S.”; I’m affiliating my moan
club with “Findy’s” society (B. 9/10/’46).
A ’phone in the home, supposedly an
asset, is a curse as soon as installed.
Where neighbors get the idea from is a
puzzle, but they all, especially in flats,
assume it to be common property. The
meal-time, bath-time or moment chosen
to enjoy the secret bottle of beer are no
deterrent. They expect to, be admitted
at any time to receive calls and allowed
to barge in at equally annoying times to
make them. Youngsters ring up as a
matter of course and expect a message to
be taken up three or four flights to tell
mum they won’t be home to dinner. A
pal seeking information from me said,
“Ring back to Mrs, Soandso; she’ll be
only too pleased to come over the road to
fetch me.” Out of sympathy to the lady
I sent the required knowledge by letter.
* * * *
“F.S.”: I am interested in the faker
of Vermeer, who is to stand his trial for
forgery and deception in Holland for
having painted pictures so like the
Master’s that experts were taken in. Con-
noisseurs, including Goring, paid the artist
large sums for them. He will probably
be put into jail, but why shouldn’t the
alleged experts be dealt with for not
being able to detect the fraud? If they
are incapable of telling the original from
the imitation they have been drawing
their salaries and emoluments on false
pretences. If, on the other hand, the
faker could paint as well as Vermeer, he
is a genius and should be given all the
money he made. If Vermeer came to
life and saw the pictures and thought
they were as good as his own, he would
certainly regard the faker as a great
painter.
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: Another picturesque tra-
dition is by way of being extinguished in
this air age, according to a Jerusalem
cable. The dinkum Mecca pilgrim used
to be picked up from his native village
in India, Africa, Malaya or the Dutch
East Indies by a converted cargo steamer.
Shipping companies made a lucrative
business out of the pious Moslems, and
packed them in like sardines. They were
taken to the nearest Arabian seaport,
dumped ashore and tramped their way
to Mecca. They were liable to be
robbed, stripped naked or murdered by
Bedouin nomads, and when they reached
the Holy City were fleeced by confidence
men and tricksters, but they performed
the statutory acts that devolved upon the
pious—they threw a stone at the rock
which represented a false prophet; they
gazed on Mohammed’s coffin, which is
suspended in mid-air, but has supports be-
neath it so that the unsophisticated won’t
be frightened out of their wits by this
miraculous defiance of the laws of gravi-
tation ; they performed their devo-
tions in the mosque, through whose ceil-
ing the pure of heart can see right into
heaven. If the pilgrim survived the re-
turn trip he arrived at his village a full-
fledged hadji, a man of peculiar sanctity
and credited with almost supernatural
wisdom. This year many incipient
hadjis will do the trip from Palestine by
’plane in eight hours instead of the long
weeks it used to take by foot and camel.

“Becks” on a quiz-master’s boner:
The storm raised in the first round of the
National Quiz when a competitor was gonged
for placing the doldrums in the Atlantic —
the judges, in defiance of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica, which allows them to haunt any
ocean, and the Nautical Almanac, which de-
fines their limits in the Atlantic, insisting that
the Pacific was their only domicile —was a
mere zephyr compared to the blast that shook
radio-sets all over Australia on the final night
of the contest. In reply to the question “Can
you name the man who, through his earnest
campaigning, secured the introduction of penny-
postage in England?” a contestant said with-
out hesitation “Sir Rowland Hill.” To the
amazement of thousands of listeners he was
told that the correct answer was “Sir John
Henniker Heaton.” Against a storm of pro-
test the judges stuck to their guns for 24
hours, then climbed down and admitted they
had pulled a boner. Irrespective of whether
the doldrums are at the North Pole or in
the Sahara Desert there is no room for doubt
on the penny-postage question. Rowland Hill’s
efforts resulted in its introduction in Great
Britain in 1840, eight years before Henniker
Heaton was born. His contribution towards
the encouragement of letter-writing was the
extension of penny-postage throughout the
Empire. This came in 1898, and 10 years later
the same rate was made to apply to mail from
Britain to U.S.A. Henniker Heaton had strong
ties with Australia. He came to this country
as a lad and stayed 20 years. After several
years in the sheep country he drifted into
journalism and married a daughter of Samuel
Bennett, founder of the “Evening News” and
proprietor of the “Empire,” which Henry
Parkes had founded. In 1879 Henniker Heaton
published An Australian Dictionary of Dates
and Men of the Time, in which he aimed “to
embody in a lasting form a digested summary
of every branch of Australian history.” Five
years later he went to the Amsterdam exhibi-
tion as Commissioner for N.S.W., and, stopping
off in England, began to advocate cheaper
postage and telegraph rates between Britain and
the colonies. Tasmania sent him to a Berlin
conference on telegraphy in 1885. That was his
last official connection with Australia, but as
a member of the Commons from 1885 to 1910
he campaigned strenuously and successfully for
cheaper communications within the Empire,
He was still fighting for further reductions in
cable rates when he died at Geneva in 1914.
A SUGGESTION.
“A plaque has been erected in Natal to mark
the exact place where Mr. Winston Churchill was
captured by the Boers in 1900.”
’Tis pleasant to commemorate
Some happ’ning in the early prime
Of anyone who’s lived to climb
To dizzy peaks of high estate.
And now on Afric’s sunny shores
A plaque the storied site will show
Where Winston Churchill long ago
Was gathered in by bearded Boers.
Here in Australia, one regrets
To note, we’re somewhat less inclined
To keep our famous men in mind
By such historical vignettes.
No tablet any longer marks,
As once it did, the King-street site
Where broken toys were put to right
By the illustrious Henry Parkes.
And who today can train his lamps
Upon the joints where Billy Hughes
Compounded vegetable stews
Or reconditioned ailing gamps? .
I wonder shall we ever see
Some effort made to point the place
Where he who now is Labor’s ace •
First stepped into publicity.
Why not a plaque to stamp the scene
To other famous fields akin,
Where Chifley left his engine in
The railway strike of ’l7?

LL.2.IS
THE SERVICE MAN
Russia, Turkey, China—and
Australia.
“Ek Dum”: Two powder magazines
continue to dominate the military
politics of the world. And over each of
them the U.S.S.R. holds a match.
The policy of the U.S.S.R. is, of course,
as M. Molotov declares with great regu-
larity, one of peace. His aspirations are
generally applauded except in those diplo-
matic circles which understand Russian
dialect and realise that the peace which
Moscow aims for is a peace with a
difference.
The objective as applied to countries
which might seriously hurt Russia in a
collision is to maintain tolerable relations
with their Governments, which are not
under Russian influence or domination,
while thwarting their policies to the limit.
At the same time it seems to be the Russian
policy to foster internal Communist strife,
which eventually leads (it is hoped) to
successful civil war. In this the Com-
munists are supported to the full, but
clandestinely, by the Russians, who, how-
ever, disclaim responsibility for their
actions. When the insurrectionists or
revolutionists have their way they natur-
ally turn to the “Workers’ Only Father-
land” for help. And the Workers’ Only
“Y' Won y'r bet. Blue — it's a nut. Now let's get back to the reunion."
Fatherland sends them help and guidance
in the shape of a commissar or commis-
sars, as has been done in all the Balkan
countries except Greece, with Hungary
thrown in. Where possible, armed force
goes with the commissar.
It is only when the policy fails that
different tactics are adopted, and the
world’s two powder magazines at present
are those in which there has been failure,
These are Turkey and China,
In Turkey Russo-Communist infiltra-
tion attempts began in the early twenties,
Almost every village across the main
routes of Asia Minor was dowered with
a Communist propagandist of some sort,
But the Army appeared to have an affec-
tion for them and gobbled them up for
“training.”
The Russians were remarkably patient
with the Turks for over 20 years. But
they had a reason—it centred round their
relations with Germany, which they did
not wish to disturb. They were provid-
ing the Germans with a training ground
for officers and sharing with the experi-
mental Reich of the first two decades
after Versailles a common aspiration in
the weakening of the “imperialist”
Powers, Britain and France.
With Germany out of the way and
largely in Russian hands, Moscow now
feels’ able to bring pressure to bear, but
it will take a lot of pressure to move
the Turk ; and General Inonii’s speech in
the Assembly a few days ago, in which
he made it clear that Turkish foreign
policy was based on his country’s treaty
with Britain, seems to leave the Russians
with only one move left in the portfolio
pf plans. What it will be remains to be
seen, but it certainly has called for great
troop movements, the closing of inter-
pational air routes over Balkan countries
and considerable belligerency over Mos-
cow Radio, which has declared that, in
the interests of Russian safety, the Turks
will “have to” give way. The Turks, of
course, cannot give way except in agree-
ment with the other parties to the Mont-
reux Agreement. And there the position
stands for the present.
In China
The other end of the great northern
continental land mass is the scene of an-
other failure of the Russian policy of
peace. The Chinese and Korean Com-
munist parties have for years been fed,
organised and financed from Russian
sources while Moscow has professed to
the outside world a total disinterestedness
in local Chinese and Korean politics,
stressing, the while, the fact that the
Chinese Communist party and the Korean
C.P. have no connection whatever with
the Russian Communists.
This is being done despite the fact that
M. Manuilsky, who also now has no con-
nection with Soviet Russia, being
“Foreign Minister of the Ukraine,” out-
lined the whole of Russian Communism’s
plans for China at great length at the
1939 All-Russian Communist Conference,
of which he was a sort of master of
ceremonies.
In Korea, where the Communists have
been busy stirring up riots and disturb-
ances, Russia poses as an innocent by-
stander. Its propagandists pretend to
have nothing to do with the spread
of rumor that the Americans have taken
away all the food and resources which
the Russians have denied the country
-through their control of northern rail-
ways. The objective is claimed to be just
as peaceful as in China,
The position in China proper has be-
come interesting. It is being stated
openly by the American-China Policy
Association, which usually knows what
it is talking about in matters Chinese, that
part of the secret agreement made at
Potsdam—of course on Russia’s initia-
tive—was to the effect that Outer Mon-
golia should be severed from China and
thus virtually turned into another Soviet
Republic and that Chiang Kai-shek
should be forced to accept a coalition
with the Communists without disband-
mg or merging the Communist armies,
The American State Department denies
this, but not in very specific terms,
The course of events hitherto has lent
color to the story. In Manchukuo the
Russians did not move out at any point
until Communist forces were ready to
move in. When the Chinese Nationalist
Army, which had the right to occupy.
arrived at towns along its agreed routes
It found that the whole countryside had
t* een stripped of everything useful for
war and peace.
Russian policy has from the first
aimed to get the Americans out of China
as soon as possible—in the main by the
normal sullen Moscow methods. The
American forces in China, now that the
bulk of the Japanese m their areas
have been repatriated, nave dwindled
almost to nothingness. And t e reahsa-
tion of this has caused a sudden stiffen-
ing of Chinese Communis Policy,
General Marshall, U.S. Specml Envoy
in China, has made a special effort within

the past fortnight to bring about agree-
ment, though it was obviously useless,
the Chinese Communists having failed
from the first to keep any of the “binding
agreements” which they made with
Chiang last February.
Kalgan Falls
While the negotiation was going on the
Chinese National Army was forcing its
way into the province which is the main
Communist stronghold in North China —
Chahar —intent on taking Kalgan, the
capital.
After General Marshall had returned
to Nanking, Chou En-lai, the Chinese
Communist leader, issued an ultimatum
in which he demanded, as-preliminaries to
peace with Chiang, the stoppage of the
drive on Kalgan and the withdrawal of
troops on both sides to the positions held
on January 13 last and from all areas
“liberated” by the Communists from the
Japanese— i.e., those areas which fell into
Communist hands when the Japanese
forces collapsed in North China. Extra
Communist representation in the pro-
posed State Council was asked for.
Chiang’s response was not conciliatory.
He last week attacked the Communists
for their obstructiveness and demanded
that they should abandon their plot to
achieve regional domination and their
habit of dividing the country by military
force.
He added: “The moment an agree-
ment can be reached the Government will
order a cease-fire, provided the Com-
munists cease their attacks on national
troops.” But, he added, national unifica-
tion was an absolute condition for peace.
Then he issued a Government decree
that all males aged from 18 to 45 were
eligible for military conscription. And
the march continued on Kalgan, which
was taken on October 12. The Com-
munists burnt a large part of the town
before retiring.
Australia’s “Russian” Peace
One other country is affected seriously
at present by Russian “peace” policies —
the policies set out in Stalin’s lectures at
Sverdlov University in which the tech-
nique of promoting industrial turmoil as
a prelude to insurrection is stated in
detail.
It was recorded in the London “Times”
last week, on the authority of a Russian
official boast, that 63,000,000 copies of
this work had been sold in a large number
of languages. The Communist party has
sold all that have been sold in friendly
countries. In Australia the book is the
standard text-book in Communist col-
leges—the Communist party was able,
in 1942, when it was an illegal body, to
print two editions, though legal bodies at
that time were being kept on the breads
line for paper and the publication of
Australian books was held up for want
of it.
The technique which Stalin’s book ad-
vocates is evident in the present industrial
strife, all, or nearly all, of which, as the
former president of the N. S. Wales
Trades and Labor Council, Mr. Kenny,
remarked recently, is organised by Com-
munists and financed by oversea funds
for purposes which come close to treason.
But Australia goes slumberously on.
The so-called “Governments” continue
to allow the tune to be called by a
formerly illegal body, admittedly directed
by the ideals of a foreign Power, which
has been caught redhanded in subversive
activities in Canada and South Africa —
in the latter country only after serious
bloodshed.
Those who laugh at the idea of revo-
lution in Australia are blind to realities.
The position at present is that revolution
and the new Communist methods are
already here. As far back as 1941 the
Ironworkers’ federal control body issued
an ultimatum that it would never allow
any Government to govern whose policies
did not suit it. It was shameless about
its* methods: “We make strikes our busi-
ness.” And this was echoed by the Com-
munist secretaries —heads of an illegal
organisation, held under “suppression”
as a subversive organisation by a “Gov-
ernment” which patronised its leaders at
every turn —including those of the
Federated Clerks, watersiders, builders
and seamen.
At present in coal, steel, shipping,
stevedoring, wool, Sydney and Melbourne
tramways and Victorian and South Aus-
tralian railways the conquering Russian-
directed agents are serving the ends of
destroying British constitutional methods
in paralysing industry.
The “Government” could have stopped
present trends easily two or three years
ago, as W. M. Hughes stopped similar
trends in World War I, by deporting- a
few treacherous ruffians. But it has
allowed matters to go so far that resist-
ance to the will of the Russian-guided
Communist leaders might bring about
something pretty close to civil war if
there is delay in dealing with them.
It is about time the country faced the
issue of the “Russian peace” which is be-
ing imposed on it.
General Berryman on Modern
War.
“Ek Dum”: At the October luncheon
of the United Service Institution of
N.S.W. Lieutenant-General Frank Berry-
man, G.O.C. Eastern Command, gave a
limited account of the proceedings of
the recent senior officers’ symposium held
at Camberley Staff College, which he
attended as one of the Australian dele-
gates.
The Camberley gathering was a truly
British-Commonwealth affair, carried
through on a great scale —apart from
others, there were nearly 80 officers of'
brigadier or general’s rank, with Field-
Marshal Lord Montgomery and the First
Sea Lord of the Admiralty and a suffi-
cient air liaison present. There was for
the first time in the history of such dis-
cussions a single civilian scientist in the
assembly.
The Imperial nature of defence was
emphasised by the fact that a very large
number of the officers present were “old
boys” of Camberley, many of them, in-
cluding General Berryman himself, pupils
of F.-M. Montgomery.
The purpose of the school was to
discuss the future of war and defence of
the British Commonwealth and Empire.
So as to have a proper framework and
substance for the discussion, certain
phases of the war in Europe were taken
as an exercise. Round these actual
operations surmises and hypothetical
problems were built up and solved.
From the discussion of them eight
general principles were plotted, a general
principle being accepted as one which
applies at all levels, whether the force en-
gaged is an army group or a platoon.
Round these newly-accepted principles
the new Field Service Regulations are
being built.
Some have been stressed or changed in
nature and comprehensiveness by the last
three years’ experience of mechanised and
air- and sea-borne war. Thus the need
for mobility has been expanded to come
within the ambit of the term flexibility,
which means the ability to use all arms
and facilities of war to the best advan-
tage in all circumstances.
This factor touches the very heart of
war methods and all its integral fabric,
since it is the core of everything from
the approaches of strategy to the design
of weapons, from the choice of battle-
fields and battle-lines (which becomes
freer with the use of swift and abundant
long-distance transport and perfection of
supply systems) to methods of movement
and the size and nature of forces.
It seems even to impinge on new dimen-
sions, with the discussion which appears
to be taking place in the European and
American press of bacterial warfare,
which has never hitherto been used, but
which certainly may be used if it comes
to an Armageddon in which the atom
bomb plays a part.
Linked with the principles of flexibility
is, of course, that of transport and the
integration of all forces —sea, air and
land. General Berryman, whose experi-
ence of this phase was gained as liaison
with the most thoroughly integrated, yet
dispersed, ~ campaign of the war —on
General MacArthur’s staff —stressed the
importance of this factor. The Army,
he said, had been called a projectile fired
by the Navy. The application of all
principles, he said, was affected by the
advent of the atom bomb and similar
weapons as well as by newer rocket
technique and offensive air-force develop-
ment.
But the effect was likely to be upon
bases of operation rather than on the
battlefield, so far as the introduction both
of new weapons and principles was con-
cerned. In battle the principles of dis-
persion were already in vogue, though
now they became more vital, along with
the need for swifter and more secret
movement.
The great basic principle of war, how-
ever, has not been altered. It is, and
remains what it had always been —some-
thing in which the human factor is
decisive.
Wars would continue to be won by
those who, in the phases of victory, were
able to best use the greatest and best-
armed forces in the determining areas of
conflict. The importance of manpower
and of infantry had been increased rather
than otherwise by modern developments.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Commodore John Collins, C. 8., who
leaves shortly for Britain for service with
the Admiralty and to attend the Imperial
Defence College, has been in command
of the Australian Squadron since May,
1944. His C.B. came to him in 1940
when, commanding H.M.A.S. Sydney, he
sank the crack Italian cruiser Bartolomeo
Colleoni and put to flight her sister ship
Giovanni della Bandenere. Sydney was
a busy ship in the Mediterranean theatre
in the first few months of Mussolini’s
war. In June, 1940, with Stuart, she
bombarded Bardia, and a week later was
in action with the Seventh Cruiser
Squadron when the Italian destroyer
Espero was sunk —Sydney picked up the
survivors. In July, in addition to the
Bartolomeo triumph, she was also in the
Gulf of Calabria scrap. During August
and September she shelled Bardia, Bomba
and Rhodes, and in October, with the
Third Cruiser Squadron, got into holts
with three Fiume-class cruisers. Back
with the Seventh Squadron again the fol-
lowing month, she took part in a raid in
the Straits of Otranto and attacked a
convoy coming out of Valona. Sydney
was a lucky ship while Collins was aboard
her; he was transferred to other duties
shortly before she fought her last fight
with the raider Kormoran. Aboard
Australia and Shropshire the commodore
saw plenty of action in the Pacific War,
and was wounded in the Philippines
operations, but it is with Sydney that his
name will always be first associated.
Sydney Uni. has announced two new
appointments to its professorial staff —
Dr. N. A. Burges to the Chair of Botany
and Dr. J. R. A. McMillan to the Chair
of Agriculture. Both men will be re-
turning to the university where they took
their degrees. McMillan graduated in
agricultural science with first-class honors
in 1924, won the University Medal and
the Ben Fuller Travelling Scholarship,
which took him to America, where he
gained his M.Sc. degree at Cornell. Back
in Sydney again he taught at Sydney
Uni., Queensland Agricultural College
and the University of Queensland, special-
ised in genetics and plant-breeding and
became research officer in that field with
C.S.I.R. In 1937 he wrote his doctorate
thesis and at present is the Common-
wealth’s acting Director-general of Agri-
culture. Dr. Burges also collected a Uni-
versity Medal and a Travelling Scholar-
ship—the James King of Irrawang—when
he graduated in Science with first-class
honors in 1932 and added a M.Sc. degree
the following year. He went to Cam-
bridge, where he gained his Ph.D., did a
lot of field work with Cambridge expedi-
tions and specialised in mycology and
plant pathology. When war broke out
he joined the R.A.F. and finished up as
a Wing-commander on H.Q. Bomber
Command. He was mentioned in dis-
patches. The two new profs will take
over their chairs in the new year.
Re-elected Westralian State President
of the R.S.L., J. M. W. Anderson has
been in the chair since the resignation of
T. S. Edmondson in March, 1944. Ander-
son is a Victorian, born at Williamstown
52 years ago. A public-servant, he
joined the Postal Department as a lad
and has served in various parts of W.A.
with that department and also with the
Customs and Electoral Departments. At
present he is Commonwealth Electoral
Officer for W.A. He went through the
First World War with Ist Divvy Sigs.
and in the last scrap was on loan to the
Welshpool ammunition factory as
accountant.
111-health has forced Jim Carroll to
turn in his A.B.C. job of racing commen-
tator ; and nobody could have broadcast
as Jim did for very long unless his health
was extra-sound. From go to whoa in
a race he described what he was looking
at as excitedly as if the event—which
might have been a muddling-run distance
handicap or a no-hopers’ novice—was
a meeting of the champions of all time.
As they turned for home, Jim’s excite-
ment, which had seemed at its top
already, rose higher still, until, as they
neared the post, he sounded as if he’d
burst the microphone, or certainly burst
something, at any moment; and it didn’t
matter much whether the winner got there
by a head or half a dozen lengths. No
matter what won, Jim’s getting the winner
home sounded like a personal triumph;
as if he owned it, had trained it, had
backed it and ridden it, and told all his
friends to be on it; and when the winner’s
number went up his announcement of it
was a regular shout of triumph. If he
hadn’t been solidly built he must have
cracked under his own strain long ago.
Even listening to him called for either
a placid mind or a stout brisket.
Scorfield here pictures the friendly fea-
tures of Brigadier lan Grant Fullarton,
G.O.C. DARWIN.
M.C., who commands Australia’s most
northerly military area —Seventh Military
District, with H.Q. at Darwin. Fullar-
ton was one of the fine third flight of
Duntrooners who were commissioned in
1915. After the end of World War I, in
which he served with distinction, win-
ning a Military Cross, he was posted to
the Staff Corps, in which he served
till the outbreak of the present one
sent him on active service. He held
his first command in the Trobriands, and
was active in the New Guinea coastal
region in the days of the advance on
Salamaua. Thence he was transferred to
the important post of 8.G.5., Second
Army, which he filled with vigor, ac-
quiring a fine reputation, before being
sent to Darwin to carry out the compli-
cated and thankless task of cleaning up
the war’s debris and returning Aus-
tralia’s only war area to a peace-time
footing. He has a high reputation as a
trainer of officers.
John Flynn is likely to be the first Aus-
tralian cleric to have a memorial erected
to him in his lifetime. Fittingly enough,
it is to be placed in the Never Never.
Last year Aerial Medical Services decided
to erect a monument at the junction of
the North-South Darwin-road and the
branch road to Mount Isa to commem-
orate the life work of its founder. Mel-
drum and Noad, the Melbourne archi-
tects, gained the award with a design tri-
angular in shape, 20 feet high, with a
reinforced concrete cross to top it, Flynn
of the Inland is now 66. He broke the
isolation of the Outback with his flying-
doctor service and wireless.
A young Australian engineer, William
George Bratz, has come up with a pocket
edition of an adding machine which he
has patented and is getting into produc-
tion. The machine will add and sub-
tract anything from a farthing to a
thousand pounds. Bratz, born in New-
castle (N.S.W.) 30 years ago, spent most
of his boyhood knocking around saw-
mills on the N.S.W. North Coast. During
the war he worked on radar components
as fitter and “marker-off” for machin-
ing from the blueprints. He was experi-
menting with a couple of other inventions
and found he needed a calculator. The
present gadget converted to show cash is
the result.
Australian-born Ronald Selkirk Pan-
ton, one of the two British correspond-
ents present at the Nuremberg hangings,
is the son of Charles Panton, who, for
more than a quarter of a century, was
a'Sydney and Melbourne journalist and,
until last year, general secretary of the
Federal Viticultural Council of Aus-
tralia. Born at Pymble (N.S.W.) 40
years ago, Ronald worked as an insur-
ance clerk in Sydney, and in 1927 went
with his brother to Europe. He pushed
a bike through Germany and Czecho-
Slovakia and studied languages at the
Berlin University, where Tasmanian-born
F. S. Delmer was an English lecturer.
Professor Delmer got him into the Berlin
office of the “Daily Express,” which in
1934 made him its Vienna correspondent.
He witnessed the 1934 disturbances in
Atistria, was fired on by the Socialists
and was in custody for a short period.
Among the scoops he scored during his
first year in Vienna was the news of the
engagement of the Duke of Kent to
Princess Marina. Three years later
Panton took over from Sefton Delmer,
son of Professor Delmer, the job of
Berlin correspondent for the “Daily
Express.” In that capacity he covered
all the big events in Germany leading
up to World War II and knew all the
Nazi bigshots. When war broke out
he and his Russian-born wife escaped
to Denmark, but the Germans caught
up with them later in Copenhagen. He
spent nearly five years in concentration
camps, but was repatriated in time to
rejoin his paper and serve for a period
as a war correspondent in France and
Germany. Since peace in Europe Panton
has covered a great many important
happenings on the Continent, more re-
cently the Nuremberg trials. During his
early years in Germany he wrote for
The Bulletin’s “Red Page.”
Hector McCowan, who succeeds
Warwick Armstrong as Australian repre-
sentative of Buchanan’s whisky, was
awarded the D.S.C. while serving as com-
mander with the R.N. during D-Day
operations in Normandy. A Yarrasider,
McCowan also served as gunnery officer
ill H.M.S. Maloja on the northern patrol,
in North Sea trawlers and the Dieppe
raid. Later he was naval officer-in-charge
of the Hook of Holland. He represented
Buchanan’s in India in 1933, and since
demobilisation has been studying the pro-
duction end of the business at the
Glasgow distilleries.
“Colbun”: Stephen Margrett, who
has died in Melbourne at 86, was in his
day the best-known figure in the once-
great Australian-Indian horse trade.
English-born, he came to Australia at 18
in the Aconcagua, a noted windjammer
of the 1870’s, and soon distinguished him-
self as a buckjump rider and bold steeple-
chaser. In 1884, then 25, he chartered the
sailing ship Night Hawk at Port
Chalmers, M.L., loaded her with 198
horses carried in loose boxes in the holds,
and after a highly adventurous voyage ot
68 days reached Madras with all but 10
still alive and in saleable condition.
Settling in Melbourne in 1886, for 53
years he was actively engaged in the trade,
chartering steamers and taking thousands
of horses to the Indian market, sometimes
himself accompanying his shipments.
Pictured here by Woolcott is Chief
Writer Dudley Wilson, doing his last job
of judging for the New Entry boxing
at Flinders Naval Depot. A son of the
A.J.C. handicapper, he joined the Navy
in 1926, winning his first boxing
NAVY ATHLETE.
championship that year, and ever since
has been in the sporting limelight. He
still carries the earmarks of his boxing
and wrestling days, which reached their
peak when he was runner-up in N.S.W.
heavyweight boxing and wrestling. In
1935 he was serving aboard H.M.A.S.
Australia when she took the Duke of
Gloucester home from his Melbourne
centenary tour, and he not only won
the inter-service heavyweight boxing
championship of Great Britain but his
swimming records for the 440 and beu
freestyle inter-service championships still
stand. A great surfer, he was N.S.W.
champion beltman, swimming for Bondi
Life Saving Club. He was captain and
coach of the Navy Rugger side when
it won the Victorian premiership last
year. He served for a time in the cruiser
Sydney not long before her loss.
Denys Dalton, a former Spitfire pilot,
has flown a single-engined-Percival Proc-
tor ’plane from England to Adelaide in
42 days. He had two women passengers,
and found the trip “safe and simple,”
with one week’s loss by floods at Ran-
goon. With a partner, he intends start-
ing an air-taxi service with headquarters
in Melbourne.
“Q.M.”; Tasmanian link with Bernard
Shaw was broken with the death in
Hobart of Miss Amy Cecilia Shaw in
her 88th year. Her father, the late E. C.
Shaw, came to Tasmania from England
in 1830, and was a brother to the late
G. C. Shaw, father of G.B.S.
Charles Swan, of Adelaide, whose re-
search on German measles in relation to
congenital blindness and deafness, has
gained world-wide recognition, leaves
early in the new year to take up an
appointment as pathologist-bacteriologist
at London University Ophthalmic Insti-
tute, and a similar post at the Royal
London Ophthalmic Hospital, the leading
centre in the Empire for post-graduate
training of eye specialists. A foundation
scholar of Scotch College, Adelaide, Swan
was captain of the school in 1929, won
the John Gordon Scholarship at St.
Andrew’s College in • 1930, graduated
M. and B.S. at Adelaide Uni. in 1935,
and became demonstrator in anatomy and
pathology. Since 1939 he’s been chasing
“bugs” at the Adelaide Institute of
Medical and Veterinary Science, and in
1941 collected his M.D. for a thesis on
infantile paralysis. Now 35, he’s just
completed a book-length report on his
research into German measles.
General Joseph Stilwell, dead in
America at 63, graduated at West Point
Military Academy in 1904, a year after
Douglas MacArthur, and, like him, learnt
his practical soldiering in the Philippines
and World War One. After the Kaiser
was licked he went to China, and in due
course became ChieTof-Staff U.S. Forces
there and military attache at the Ameri-
can Embassy in Peking. When the Japs
ran amuck in the Pacific Stilwell was
back in America, and was sent to Chung-
king on a hush-hush job to emerge as
Chief-of-Staff to Chiang Kai-shek and
commander of Chinese and American
forces in Burma. On the fall of Burma
he fought his way through to India and
returned to Chungking. During the next
two years there were continual clashes of
temperament between him and the
Chinese leader, culminating in 1944 with
the general’s recall to a home command
in the When Lieut.-General
Buckner was killed on Okinawa in June,
1945, MacArthur sent for Stilwell to take-
over the command. By then he held the
rank of full general, but “Vinegar Joe”
did not relish backline jobs and welcomed
the chance to even up scores with the
Japs for his Burma reverse. Burma got
him in the end —his death followed an
operation for a complaint that was a
legacy of his 150-mile hike through the
Burmese jungles.
Into the silence:
In Melbourne, at 58, E. A. (“Bunny”) Price,
advertising director of Melbourne “Herald.”
A Belfast man, he came to Australia in 1907
and before joining the “Herald” 15 years ago
he was running his own advertising business.
At Penshurst (Vic.), at 85, Richard Hustler,
town blacksmith for over 60 years and owner
of several racehorses. He won the Grand
National in 1898 with Floater.
At Healesville (Vic.), at 48, Francis Keith
Davison, a journalist well known in W.A.,
N. and Victoria. He joined the first A.I.F.
at 16, served on Gallipoli and won a Military
Medal. He edited the short-lived Melbourne
“Star,” and at the time of his death was on
the staff of the “Herald.”
In Melbourne, at 68, John O’Connell Brophy,
formerly of the C. 1.8. He joined the Victorian
Police Force in 1900 and transferred to the
C. 1.8. in 1912. Had a hand in the solving of
the Gun Alley murder and the Irene Tucker-
man murder. Appointed superintendent of
C. 1.8. in 1936, he' was shortly afterwards
wounded in mysterious circumstances at Royal
Park, as a result of which his health had since
been poor.
In Adelaide, at 62, H. C. Irwin, Anglican
parson, League footballer, artilleryman and
later chaplain in the first war. Latterly a mem-
ber of the staff of St. Peter’s College in
Adelaide and a radio Brains Trust man.

From Melbourne
If the fashions seen at Caulfield are a
preview of “things to come” it is going
to be a gay and colorful season. Women
werfe individual in their dressing ; not one
style was uniform and all colors had their
devotees. Many hats were worn tilted
over the forehead, but many still pre-
ferred the off-the-face line. Lady Herring,
who gave a luncheon-party in the Vice-
Regal rooms, was a rhapsody in blue.
Mrs. David Watts, of Sydney, wore with
her black frock a skull-cap of black velvet
with a large chou of many-colored
ribbons clustered at the side. Mrs. Hans
Robertson, also of Sydney, had a gay
flower-wreath hat with white ribbons as
a contrast to her black dress. Suits were
there a-plenty, with grey flannel as first
choice.
Mrs. Norman Robinson wore a summer
ermine cape over her navy-blue frock,
which she wore with a matching hat; her
daughter, Mrs. Josh Pitt, favored a grey-
tailored suit with a flower-laden hat;
Mrs. H. Silk caught the eye in a black
“cartwheel” hat with veiling; Pat Green
matched her lajge crownless pink straw
hat with the azaleas she pihned in her
black frock ; Mrs. Sam Hordern was in
teal blue, a small off-the-face cherry straw
hat striking a piquant note ; Mrs. Ken
Hooper’s all-blue ensemble was admired ;
Mrs. W. Horsfall highlighted her beige
frock and matching coat with a green
hat softly veiled in green ; Mrs. D. Cur-
tain’s Burma-red outfit was contrasted by
hat and gloves of lime tonings ; larkspur-
blue sat well on Mrs. Eric Avery, whose
hat was of pink candy-striped silk.
Piece de resistance of the Borovansky
premiere was the ballet “Coppelia,”
which was last performed here in 1913
with Adeline Genee. Edna Busse scored
a decided success in the name part of the
Delibes work. Peggy Sager, who was
applauded for her dancing in “Les Syl-
phides,” had earlier in the week been
guest-of-honor at a cocktail-party given
by the Bowen Pains to introduce her to
Melbourne presswomen. Among the
rapt was noticed Pat Hoogveld in a
dinner-gown of pale-gold crepe, the
Dolya Ribushes, who gave a dinner-party
before the ballet, Irene Mitchell and Jean
Campbell, both known for their work
with Melbourne’s Little Theatre.
The reception-room at the Town Hall
was gay with poppies and iris when inter-
state delegates to the Australian National
Council of Women were welcomed by
the Lady Mayoress, Mrs. Bernard Heinze.
Australian president, Mrs. G. L. Byth,
M.A., hails from Brisbane, as does Mrs.
V. Brotherton, M.Sc., who is honorary
assistant secretary to the council. Syd-
ney delegates were Miss Rienits, just re-
turned from England, Mrs. W. R. Dovey
and Miss R. Board. The Lady Mayoress’s
bottle-green frock was worn with a
matching hat.
A bumper audience turned up for the
last of the 1946 Celebrity Concerts series,
which was also a farewell for conductor
Bernard Heinze, who leaves shortly for
Canada. Mrs. Bernard Heinze, a summer
ermine coat over her prune-toned crepe
frock, came with her sons Adrian and
Julian. Also in the party were Mrs. A.
B. Jamieson, soignee in black with its
deep waistband of contrasting gold and
blue, and Neville Cardus. Mrs. Massey
Burnside chose a gown of duck-egg-blue-
glazed chintz, patterned in a field-flowers
design of cream and brown. Marie
Louise Fowler was in black crepe, plus
a short ermine bolero. With Lindsay
Nicholas was his wife, pianist Hephzibah
Menuhin,
Lady Herring opened the Women’s
Services Club, which is now housed in
what, during the war, was Air Force
House. The soft lights, gay carpets and
bowls of flowers in the newly-furnished
lounge, plus the gay attire of the many
women guests, made a delightful setting
for the party. General Blarney chatted
to Col. Sybil Irving, of the A.W.A.S.,
Chief-Officer Sheila McClemans,
W. and former director of the
W.A.A.A.F. Claire Stevenson, A.A.N.S.
Matron-in-Chief Col. A. M. Sage, Matron
Brindley, Principal Matron of Victoria,
and Sister M. Sayer, formerly a p.-0.-w.
in Sumatra, foregathered. Now out of
uniform, Mrs. Rod Stone was with her
husband. Another nurse back in Civvy-
street was Margaret Anderson, winner of
the George Medal. With Air-Commodore
Knox Knight was his wife. Ruth Morton,
Collier and Eileen O’Farrell were a
well-dressed trio. Judge F. Gamble came
with his wife.
Alice Wyatt gave a luncheon party at
her Amesbury House flat for Mrs.
Tommy Trinder, wife of the English
comedian now laugh-making for Tivoli
audiences. The guest-of-honor’s eyes
certainly popped when she saw the
table groaning under dainties she hadn’t
seen for years, and which included a
pink-iced cake the sight of which a year
or so back would have pushed Deddie’s
blood pressure up around the 200-mark.
Mrs. Trinder wore a powder-blue-and-
black ensemble, and her small blue hat
was flower-trimmed. Alice wore a hip-
length white tailored coat over her black
frock. Hazel Honeyman told other
guests present that she had collected over
500 hats from her friends. These she has
renovated and will sell at the fete for
the Royal Melbourne Hospital in the
Town Hall early next month. Party was
also a farewell to Jenny Howard, who has
gone to Sydney. Farewells were also
said to Mrs. R. Massey, who left in the
Stirling Castle to visit her mother in
England.
The happy bride here is Jean, only
daughter of Mrs. J. Phillips, of Toorak,
and the late Mr. G. Phillips. Jean was
married to Clayton Beckingsale, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. C. G. Becking-
sale, Glen Iris. A former member of
the R.A.A.F., the ’groom was a p.-0.-w.
in Crete. Jean chose a simple bouffant
lace-trimmed white marquisette gown,
wore orange-blossom with her short tulle
veil and carried a bouquet of white
gardenias. After the ceremony a garden
reception was held at the home of her
mother, Clayton and his bride will leave
shortly for Rhodesia, where he has a
position waiting for him on a tobacco-
plantation.
Guest of honor at a party given by the
Les Sangsters at Menzies’ was Mrs. Inez
Alouche, of Sydney, who is going to
Cairo to marry one of its well-known
residents. Bill Worrall. Another sister,
Mrs. Neta Bateman, is going along to be
matron-of-honor, while Sydneysider
Sheila Hunter will also be in attendance.
The host and hostess also hope to leave
Melbourne early next year in the Orion,
their destination also being the Nile-side
city. Among the guests at the party were
Dr. and Mrs. McDermott, the Arthur
Crofts, Dave and Mrs. Worrall and Mr.
and Mrs. E. Haseman.
Bells pealed merrily and the sun shone
brilliantly for the wedding at St. John’s
of Rosita, only daughter of Col. and Mrs.
Allan Spowers, of Toorak. Bridegroom
is the second son of Mrs, Simon Fraser,
also of Toorak. The ceremony was per-
formed by the Rev. H. M. Arrowsmith.
The bride wore a lovely old-world gown
belonging to her grandmother. Fashioned
of soft cream moire striped taffeta, it had
an exquisite pearl-embroidered panel
down the front of the skirt. A coronet
of orange-blossoms was worn with her
tulle veil, and she carried lily of the valley
and stephanotis. Attendants Margaret
Mears and Angela Dale wore frocks of
dusty-pink corded silk with pink rose-
buds and lily of the valley in their hair.
Tiny Rosita Green, the trainbearer, was
in pink net. Over 300 guests later
attended the reception at Toorak House,
home of the bride’s parents. , Mrs. Allan
Spowers’ small hat was crowned with
matching ostrich feathers and toned with
her blue ensemble. Mrs. Simon Fraser,
smart in beige, received with the bride’s
parents. Mrs. Gordon Chirnside’s large
brown felt hat was encircled by brown
ostrich feathers and was worn with a
beige frock and brown ermine coat.
Mother of small Rosita, Mrs. N. Green,
was attractive in a blue bustled gown of
stiff faille and a flower hat. Kathleen
Goodall wore a grey and white pencil-
striped suit and tailored felt hat in the
same tone. R. G. Casey proposed the
toast to the bridal couple.
From Sydney
The Governor, Lieut.-General John
Northcott, is a grand man to have at a
party. He has a pleasant informal way
of talking and a nice smile that make for
instant success. As one woman remarked.
glancing towards his Ex. at the English
Speaking Union’s reception, “America
can have its Sinatras.” President of the
E.S.U, Frank Whiddon was unable to be
present, but Stephen Herford made
speech of welcome. The Governor’s
speech had as wide a range as a round-
the-'tfvorld ’plane flight. America was in it,
and the stricken countries of Europe and
the Pacific, history books (dangerous
ground this with history Professor
Gabriel, formerly of Yale University and
now of Sydney Uni., on his right), a
tribute to General MacArthur, and a neat
thumbnail sketch of “Ike” Eisenhower.
Elizabeth Northcott looked attractive —
silver ornaments and a blue hat lighting
her black frock. Mrs. Frank Whiddon,
Mrs. Lucy Proud, Mrs. Prescott and Mrs.
Hamblin were amid the committee
members whose feet trod a priceless
carpet, this same carpet furthermore em-
bellished with a round table of golden
walnut. Mrs. Harry Twigden, del-
phinium-blue her hat and suit, Mrs.
Persia Porter, expensive-looking in silver-
fox, Mrs. Vernon Cole, Dorothy Smith
and E.S.U. secretary, Mrs. Wallace
Turner, very trig in a brown-checked suit,
the W. H. Brownes and Mrs. H. J. Brady
were in the groups that clustered about
the American visitors: the Robert Bur-
lingames, Professor and Mrs. Gabriel and
Mrs. Dennett. Captain Tony Findlay was
in attendance on the Governor. Red
roses were sent with the Union’s com-
pliments to Mrs. Northcott, who could
not be present. Baritone Noel Melvin
was the afternoon’s singer.
The Blue Roundel handicrafts shop in
Rowe-street, already known for its fine
displays of ex-servicemen’s and -women’s
work, will be taken over by the War
Widows’ Graft Guild from November 1.
Goods will still be taken from the ex-
servicemen and -women who already
supply the shop with their work. A com-
mission to cover running expenses will be
charged, and the staff of the shop will be
voluntary helpers. The War Widows’
Guild intends to stock the shop with
bright wares suitable for Christmas gifts
—dolls among them. The Governor,
Lieut.-General Northcott, and Mrs.
Northcott have granted their patronage to
the undertaking.

In the Guy Blaxlands’ old home at
Hunter’s Hill there is a clock has
marked off the hours since 1880. It* was
a prize won by a former Blaxland for a
vase of roses at one of this city’s horti-
cultural shows. In the same home there
is another treasure: a silver hot-water
plate. That was also won in the years
gone by by another Blaxland for a show
of 24 chrysanthemums. No wonder
that Guy Blaxland is pleased to be
president of the Royal Horticultural
Society of this State. He and Mrs. Biax-
land are enthusiastic gardeners, and in
last week’s spring flower show in the big
hall of the Y.M. there was a fragrant
and artistic display of roses grown by
Mrs. Blaxland.
Being grilled at the beginning of the
week and frozen midway had not hurt
the blooms on the long tables. Maybe
some of the Black Boys were a little paler,
the yellow roses somewhat creamy, but
otherwise there was no ill effect. The
prize-winning table of gerberas and roses
was a brilliant and finely-blended dis-
play. There were carnations of great
size and beauty—that Yvonne among
them. The rose Dame Edith Helen ran
a close second to Crimson Glory in favor.
President of the Rose Society, Mr.
Williamson, secretary of the Historical
Society, Price Conigrave, and Mrs. Tosi
were among those fluttering from the
lilacs and the hippeastrum on the top
table to the surprised-looking pansies
down by the door.
An inter-divisional contest recently
concluded in No. 7 Police Division in
connection with the Youth Campaign
was won by Joan Pountney, of 51 Dal-
meny-avenue, Rosebery. In recognition
June Russell has presented her with a
very valuable thoroughbred hack for
show purposes. The official presentation
took place at the Police Depot, Bourke-
street, Redfern, last Saturday morning.
The hack will be known by the proud
title of Royal Ruffle. Both Joan and June
are noted riders.
Gold-injection for Sydney Hospital
Maintenance Fund from the ball in the
Trocadero last Thursday night. The
Troc. held its usual quota —between 1400
and 1500—and Governor John Northcott
came along and received the debs. There
were nine of them, tinctured with medi-
cine in varying degrees, and all very
attractive. After Mrs. D. E. Morris, her
black crepe shimmering with . sequins,
had presented them, the girls danced as
pretty a minuet as could be met with.
Elizabeth Northcott, Betty Black and
Tony Findlay, A.D.C., were in the Gov-
ernment House group. Knight Norman
Paul, who is Sydney’s president, and his
lady, the spring-leaf green of her frock
woven with silver, president of the ball
committee Mrs. J. K. Schartl in black
chiffons, Matron of Sydney Hospital
Elsie Pidgeon and Dr. Norman Rose
bloomed in the official party.
The Roland Fosters had a wedding in
the family last Saturday. Mrs. Foster’s
sister, Evelyn Houston, became Mrs. Ern
Morrow in St. Jude’s, Randwick. Brother-
in-law Roland gave the bride away.
’Groom’s family live in Melbourne.
Maoriland’s High Commissioner J. Ct
Barclay and Mrs. Barclay were the big
chiefs at the Dominion Day Ball in the
Town Hall last week. They sped, with
official blessing, 24 debs into the world
of grown-up wonders. This youth group
sparkling with enjoyment was presented
by the president of the club and of the
ball committee, Mrs. E. Hempton, who
trailed laces. The Consuls-
General for U.S. and for Greece attended
the ball with their wives. Captain Tony
Findlay and Major Bieri also made a
night of it. Money goes to 'the R.A.A.F.
Memorial Centre Appeal.
Artist Peter Bousfield, top-coat collar
upturned, was off to the mountains the
day after his show of paintings was
opened by Minister for Tourist Activities
and Immigration Clive Evatt. Mr. Bous-
field has named his show “Vanished
Europe,” and indeed people who had
travelled in Europe previous to this war
looked with a little longing at the land-
scape and street scenes that they, too,
had gazed on in the deceitful peace be-
tween the wars.
The Royal Empire Society in Sydney
lined up with the R.E. in Bath recently
and celebrated Phillip of Australia
Day. It was in Bath that the wise and
capable Governor Phillip made his home
after his Australian epic. The Trocadero
was crowded with guests for the
Sydney laudations, and the Governor
Was the guest -of - honor. General
Northcott makes a splendid speech.
His words are sincere; and his
tone has a conversational, convincing
quality. His subject was Admiral Phillip,
first Governor of N.S.W. Royal Empire s
president Colonel Spain made the perfect
introductory remarks.
Guest speakers at the next Australian-
American Co-operation (women’s sec-
tion) movement’s lunch on October
31 will be Professor Louise Over-
acker and singer Strella Wilson.
Miss Overacker, who is Professor of
Political Science at Wellesley College,
Massachusetts, has come to Australia for
a year to study our political party system.
Strella is recently returned from a five-
months’ tour of Japan and China, where
she and her party gave 104 concerts to the
troops. Strella has a first-hand story to tell
about the work of the boys in these zones.

The co.’s fleet of 28 vessels (six passenger
and 22 cargo) aggregating 76,389 tons
is still under charter to the Federal Gov-
ernment. The Manunda (9115 tons),
used as a hospital ship, is now being
refitted to take up the inter-State run
again, but the Manoora (10,856 tons)
has yet to be reconditioned and returned.
The sluggishness of the Government
and the hobbling effects of political in-
terference and of industrial developments
and disturbances moved chairman M. G,
Anderson to these pertinent remarks:
The function of a Government is to
govern, and so also the function of a
management is to manage. I therefore
think that it is in the best interests of our
community and its shipping industry that
its management be freed of stultifying con-
trols as early as possible, so enabling its
natural administrators to resume their
work. It is futile to expect any sound
management if controlled by political in-
fluences with no experience of ship man-
agement.
During the war ship earnings were
based on austere compensation rather
than an adequate return for services
rendered. Government charter-rates are
not sufficient' to cover increased cost of
maintenance and repairs (which have
more than doubled since 1939) plus
adequate depreciation. In this respect
the whole framework of Government
policy is out of alignment with modern
practice. Scrapping at a stage that would
have been considered wasteful a decade
or more ago is now hailed by shipping
men as the high-road to efficiency, since
it permits incorporation of the newest
ideas, which increase competitive power
by enhancing amenities and quickening
speed, and therefore the turn-about of
ships, thus helping to offset the effects of
increased running and construction costs
and delays in port.
The heavy cost of keeping the ships,
especially the older ones, up to ordinary
trade standards was largely responsible
for the sharp drop of £21,788 in last
term’s net earnings, most of which came
from ancillary and subsidiary interests.
These include takings from tugs, lighters,
engineering shops and returns from a
wad of outside investments. The latter
include £1,397,250 in Government secu-
rities and cash, over half a million shares
in J. and A. Brown and Abermain-
Seaham Collieries, 21,712 shares in Amal-
gamated Wireless and a holding in
National Airways.
The £169,499 of profit, poorest show-
ing in the last decade, was 7.2 p.c. on
capital as against 8.2 p.c. for the previous
term. It was written after providing for
depreciation, but includes £20,000 added
to the insurance account (£455,000) and
£lO,OOO (half the previous year’s addition)
to replacements, etc., reserve (£343,500).
Half a point was chipped off the div.,
reducing it to 6 p.c.
As for the future, the spread of Com-
munism among the miners has obscured
the outlook for coal; on the shipping
side, costs have rocketed owing to lifts
in wage-rates and prices for fuel, stores,
etc. The Government proposes to con-
tinue regulation of freight charges, pas-
senger fees, etc., and the coastal trade
is to be reserved for Australian-built
ships, to be delicensed after they become
25 years old. In addition there is the
question of a 40-hour week, a further
lift in the basic wage and deterioration
in efficiency of labor. It all means a
sharp rise in capital and other costs, and
the public will have to pay higher pas-
senger and freight charges. The weakest
link in Australia’s economic armor is
high and rising costs.
Financially the co. is well-equipped;

* Includes investment fluctuation reserve (now

The underlying principle of the business,
and of others like it, is the pooling of
small savings for collective investment.
By spreading funds over a wide range
of securities the risk of violent fluctua-
tions in earnings, and therefore in divs.,
is reduced. Divs. are usually moderate
until substantial reserves are built up
to support and assist capital. Thus the
investor, especially the investor of
moderate means, is relieved of the anxiety
of managing a small portfolio to the best
advantage.
Judged on this basis the co. has given
a satisfactory account of itself from the
start (1928). The div. climbed steadily
to 6 p.c. in 1938, then dropped to 4\
p.c. for the next three years, and to 4
p.c. for the four years to end June, 1945,
followed by 4 \ p.c. last term. And share-
holders can now see net assets with a
market value equal to 7s. lid. per ss.
share. Not a bad performance consider-
ing the restricted investment opportunities
and altered outlook for some securities
that war brought about, and the effects
of high taxation, cheap money, the
pegging of share prices and other finan-
cial controls upon investment earnings.
Loss of divs. from tin and rubber fol-
lowed Japan’s entry into the war, and
some of the co.’s American securities had
to be sold to the Government at a loss.
These and other capital losses appear in
the introductory table as reductions in
reserves.
The number of securities held, their
aggregate book value and geographical
spread compare as follows since 1939:

Thus investments in Britain and U.S.A.

Changes in the class of securities held
were as follows:
1939. . 1941. 1945. 1946.

Pref. shares .. 8.3 ~ 8.0 ~ 5.1 „ 4.9 „
Ord. shares .. 87.5 „ 88.0 „ 86.3 „ 88.6 „
The large holding of ord. shares is spread
over a wide range of well-selected stocks,
and prospects of better returns, and of
capital appreciation, are encouraging.
Quiet conditions prevailed in the in-
vestment market and cos. generally main-
tained dividend payments last term.
There was little change in the net result
at 4.6 p.c. on capital, compared with
4.6, 4.8, 4.3, 4.5, 5.4, 5.3, 4.8 and 6.4
p.c. back to 1938. Changes in investment
resulted in a capital profit of £612, which
lifted the investment fluctuation reserve
to £44,797.
The general outlook is* encouraging.
Recent easing of prices, especially among
market leaders, was due partly to technical
factors. There is no evidence of any
mass of unhealthy market speculation.
Industry has never had a larger order
book, and the current position on
’Change is strengthened by a shortage
of scrip, which new issues have only
partly relieved. On the other hand
serious domestic problems have to be
faced. Add return of the competitive
era, and the verdict seems to be that,
while the outlook is good, care in selec-
tion should now be the keynote of in-
vestment.
The board recently proposed to make
a new share issue, but the capital control
authorities turned down the request. Here
are balance-sheet figures:

This big department store occupies the
entire end of one of the busiest blocks
in Sydney. It specialises in fashion goods,
and its assets total over £2,300,000. Like
many other retailers, it enjoyed a record
turnover last term. Sales were stimu-
lated by a heavy demand for replace-
ment of wardrobes by demobilised ser-
vice personnel and by the requirements
of a civilian market partly starved of
goods for the last half-dozen years.
Merchandise, including imports, came
forward in better volume, but many
goods are still in short supply.
The buoyancy of turnover is illustrated
in the following table, which shows per-
centage changes in aggregate sales of 22
Sydney stores compared with the corres-
ponding period of the previous year:

The increase in Farmer’s turnover “com-
pares more than favorably with the
aggregate percentage of the trade as a
whole.”
After allowing for taxation and other
contingencies net profit was £9827
stronger at £112,224, second best in the
co.’s history. It covered the prefs.’ full
contract rates and 18 p.c. on the £400,000
of ord. capital, compared with 15.6, 15.1,
13.1, 13.2, 17.5 and 18.5 p.c. back to
1940. The div. was kept at 10 p.c., and
looks like remaining there, for a while at
any rate. On shareholders’ funds (pref.
and ord. capital and reserves combined)
the year’s profit was 7.5 p.c. So the pref.
money, which calls for an average of
6.6 p.c., is earning more than its keep.
As the present hunger for goods abates
retail turnovers can be expected to ease.
On the other hand, the general economic
background of “full” employment, a
more generous supply of merchandise and
the lag in demand for all descriptions of
household furnishings and equipment are
encouraging features. Less encouraging
are the upswing of costs and the heavy
burden of co. taxation, the effects of
which will be felt more severely when de-
mand eases and competition becomes
more aggressive. One thing urgently
calling for simplification is price-control.
Chairman H. N. Pope says:
New price orders continue to be issued
in considerable volume, while the methods
employed seem to utterly disregard any
fixed principle which is clear to traders.
The most complicated methods of costing
are laid down in great detail and the
basis adopted is quite foreign to any estab-
lished practice in many branches of manu-
facture.
Experience shows that business is most
successful when its operations are free
from detailed Government interference.

Aberfoyle Tin, near Avoca (Tas.), is
one of Australia’s leading producers of
tin and wolfram concentrates. For the
year to June 30 last the co. netted
£20,899 (down £16,123), equal to 33.4 p.c.
on capital. The new 10-ton-an-hour mill,
which is operating satisfactorily, treated
21,443 tons (up 2252 tons) ore for 338.7
tons tin concentrates and 59.8 tons wol-
fram concentrates. The drop in earnings
was due to a sharp fall in the price of
tungsten (the wolfram product) during
the second half of the term, a further in-
crease in costs, additional expenditure on
development, etc. (£4031, up £1444), and
tax payments and allowances totalling
£9996 for two years. The figure for tin
concentrates remained steady at the war-
time rate of £330 per ton of metal. The
div. was lifted from 20 p.c. (£12,500) to
22.5 p.c. (£14,062), and £7205 (£24,702 in
the previous term) was earmarked for
new plant and development. Thanks to
development on Nos. 5 and 6 levels, sub-
stantial additions have been made to ore
reserves, now 126,097 tons positive and
14,405 tons probable, equal to about
six years’ work for the mill. A feature
of the deposit is that the ore occurs in
a series of lenticular veins, varying
in width from a fraction of, an
inch to 7ft. When the books" closed
there were current assets totalling
£42,596 to meet liabilities, including tax
provision, of £15,816. The ss. shares
fetch 10s. or thereabouts in the market.

Ratrut Basin Tin Dredging, whose
property at Sichon (Siam) was worked on
a 50-50 tribute basis by Burma-Malay
Tin, reports that the greater part of the
plant is in such a hopeless state that it
would be impossible to recondition it.
The board is therefore preparing a claim
based on total loss. When the property
fell into enemy hands early in December,
1941, there was about 7,390,000 c.y., esti-
mated to contain 2138 tons t.o. (average
0.641 b. per yard), still to be dredged.
The dredge, etc., stands in the books at
£89,823. At end March the co. had £6362
in cash in Australia and London. Paid
capital is £121,494 in 68,251 first and
26,655 second prefs., both 10 p.c. cumu-
lative, and 26,588 ords. In addition there
is £IO,OOO of 10 p.c. debentures. Accrued
pref. divs, total £118,632 and debenture
interest £4750. It is a high-cost show,
and the outlook for shareholders is any-
thing but promising.

Enterprise of New Guinea Gold and
Petroleum expects the War Damage Com-
mission to commence assessment of'the
co.’s claim (amount not stated) in respect
of its Edie Creek, New Guinea, property
early in November. Stores and supplies
are being accumulated at a depot about a
mile from the mine. In September, 1940,
proved ore was put at 125,000 tons, assay-
ing 6.7dwt. gold and 4.20 z. silver. In
addition there was reckoned to be
418,000 tons possible ore of milling grade
(sdwt. or more) between the surface and
No. 3 level in the main lode. War ter-
minated negotiations for sale of the mine
to New Guinea Gold Fields, Ltd. Early
this year a £125,000 option on the
property, said to be granted to a repre-
sentative of American interests, was not
exercised. The co.’s £5 shares paid to
775. each recently sold at various figures
between 30s. and 40s.

Having exercised its option over E. G.
Banks’s Mt. Todd goldmine. Pine Creek
(N.T.), Gold Exploration and Develop-
ment, a Melbourne-controlled concern, is
launching Mt. Todd Gold Mine, N.L.,
to take over and work the property.
Nominal capital is £31,250 in ss. shares,
of which those on the promoting co.’s
register are to have prior rights to apply
for 60,000 (30 for every syndicate share
held), and 20,000 are to be offered the
public. The vendor is to take 12,000
paids, plus £6OOO cash, of which half
will be payable from gold won, and Gold
Prospecting and Development is to get
4000 paids and £750 cash. Proved and
probable ore is estimated at 80,000 tons,
averaging 13.5dwt., or about £6 13s. a
toij, after deducting gold tax. If estimates
prove correct, and treatment and re-
coveries not too troublesome, there should
be a good profit in the 80,000 tons,
though costs are likely to be high. On
the board of Gold Prospecting and De-
velopment are E. G. Banks, A. P. Flock-
hart, L. G. May and C. G. Robinson,
who are also the proposed directors of
it the new co.

Coolgardie Brilliant has decided to
postpone calling in geologist K. J.
Finucane to report on its Mt. Vernon
(W.A.) leases until present blocked ore is
treated. The work is expected to take
about three months, and crushing is
to begin any day now. The cyaniding
plant has already handled 300 tons of
low-grade residues for 320 z. fine gold.
* * * »
Capital is being sought to revive the
now almost down-and-out but once pros-
perous Greenbushes tin-field (W.A.).
More than £1,000,000-worth of the metal
has been taken out of the ground there,
and a lot more is reckoned to have been
left behind. Rich, though small, tantalite
deposits are also spoken of.

“Goldie”: The price of gold, admit-
tedly high on paper, has less appeal than
the old standard price of £3 17s.T01d. in
times when the seller could get real value
for his money. Working costs have more
than doubled, and the gold tax takes half
of all over £9 a fine ounce. We get about
£8 15s. clear an ounce from the mine,
ours being slightly below standard gold
in its native state. Goldwinners aren’t
assessed for income tax, but about 8± p.c.
of gross earnings goes off in the gold tax.

SUNDRY SHOWS
TOMMY TRINDER.
When Lord Mayor Connelly, intent on
proving his devotion to the cause of a
Brighter Melbourne, entered Melbourne
Tivoli for the Trinder first night the wide-
mouthed, long-faced comedian with the
horse’s profile (his own description)
flopped down on his stomach on the
stage and made a series of Oriental genu-
flections. In this and other ways, right
to the fantastic finish of the show, he
showed his capacity to keep a house
friendly and responsive and to get the
most out of his associates, the audience
included.
Traditional Cockney music-hall humor
is Trinder’s forte, but the easy gaiety
with which he lives it puts him in the
front rank of court jesters. With pro-
fessional conspirators popping up all
over the house—from latecomers (“We
started without you; is that all right?”)
to a cleaner who explains that he is the
theatre censor and wants to keep the
show clean —Trinder kept the ball of
entertainment tossing to and fro across
the footlights. He is not a rapid-fire artist,
but a cool and calculated actor who can
give an air of spontaneity to a well-
prepared piece of audacity—as when the
spotlight shifted to the monogram “T.T.”
on the proscenium arch and the comedian
burbled “You see, this is my joint.”
There was mimicry of a special order
in Mr. Trinder’s impersonations of Car-
men Miranda in a pretentious ballet and
of Frank Sinatra, with moonstruck
damsels having hysterics all around him.
It is a long time since the Tiv. has had
a more lively programme.
When Trinder could be prised away
from the footlights there were other good
things on the Tiv. programme. Larry
Collins, a trombonist who plays Brahms
while he takes his instrument to pieces
and finally plays him just as well or ill
on nothing but the mouthpiece, and two
human corpses dressed as American
soldiers and apparently suffering from
rheumatoid arthritis while they turn on
a balancing act which staggers the
imagination were the best of them.
"The Apple Cart."
Shaw, despite his carrot juice,' his
artistic posturings and his frequent
sacrifice of psychological truth for wit, is
an amazing old man. As witness “The
Apple Cart,” written in 1929, and now
being given a dramatic reading by the
Kuring-gai Guild at Killara. The play
deals with England in the reign of King
Magnus, and among many wobbly
prophecies there are some which are
stingingly apropos. The League of
Nations is mentioned as a world force,
but then again the American ambassador,
in a conversation with the king, scorn-
fully dismisses Germany as a geographical
expression—a mere group of Soviet re-
publics. Which is near enough to current
events to be convincing.
The interview between Magnus and the
American is the funniest in the play and
has the solid background of contem-
porary events to give topical edge to
its malice. O. D. Bisset, as Magnus, is
excellent —urbane. Machiavellian and
dignified. F. E. G. Batley, as the Yank,
plays Shaw’s creation —an overstated
American —well.
The reading was given with movements,
and after a slow start gained animation
and sparkle. Anthea Rush, as Queen
Jemima, was almost as good as Bisset,
who had the kind of role which he always
handles extremely well. The rest of the
cast Sylvia Lance-Thompson as
Lysistrata, Barbara Smith as the Princess
Alice, C. W. Thomas as Proteus, the
Prime Minister, and Betty McDowell as
Orinthia, the King’s Mistress —were all
convincing. As also was Shaw’s prophecy
of a growing breed of politicians.

Sydney had a musical treat when the
A.B.C. brought Hephzibah Menuhin,
Bernard Heinze and the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra together for the Brahms
No. 2 Concerto, Opus 83. A work of
tremendous breadth and depth, it shows
clearly the great advance the composer
made in the 20 years between it and the
First Piano Concerto. This Second, in-
spired by the beauty of the Italian
countryside in spring, is for the most
part reflective and tranquil, yet of fine
thematic strength. Miss Menuhin had
magic in her fingers; in particular the
third movement, the Andante, one of the
loveliest passages in the entire range of
pianoforte music, was played with a
beautiful sonority. Bracketing the Con-
certo were the Mozart “Figaro” Over-
ture —sparkling and elegant—and a well-
balanced interpretation of Brahms’s
Fourth Symphony.
* * * *
A broken wire on the Steinway which
necessitated a visit by a providential
mechanic to the platform didn’t prevent
Volterra keeping a large house en-
thralled through an all-Chopin pro-
gramme at Melbourne Town Hall. No
composer equals Chopin for exploiting
the versatility of the piano, and few vir-
tuosi have appeared in Melbourne able to
cover such a wide range of feeling as Vol-
terra. He was featherly, vivacious,
dreamy and profound as suited his
occasions, and in the Sonata in B Flat
Minor he touched great depths.
"Blithe Spirit."
Although sentimental films often drag
tears from sentimental audiences, good
films rarely draw applause from the tiers
of apparently transfixed and half-hyp-
notised spectators. That unusual tribute
was accorded the film version of Coward’s
“Blithe Spirit”—the comedy of an author
plagued by the ghost of his first wife and,
finally, by the ghost of his second one as
well —which galvanised the audience into
unrestrained applause on several occasions
during the screening which this com-
mentator attended at Sydney Embassy.
It was not so much Mr. Coward’s
comedy—a good one nevertheless—which
drew the applause as Margaret Ruther-
ford’s acting as Madame Arcati, the
medium who up the shades more
easily than she can dispose of ’em. Her
performance is not simply a case of
actress and role meeting, matching and
doing each other full justice; she seems
almost to set fire to the part and send
it up in one gusty, colorful blaze.
From the moment she appeals pedal-
ling her bicycle down a country
road and sniffing in the country air
like a healthy, hungry bloodhound,
she is almost unbelievably good.
And thereafter, whether she’s calling up
spirits, crystal-gazing, throwing trances,
almost passing out with pleasure at the
news of her success, or manipulating her
spiritualistic paraphernalia with the en-
thusiasm of a biologist on a bughunt, she
plays the part with such comedy and
tremendous vitality that at any moment
she seems likely to Vanish, witchlike, in
a cloud of green smoke.
Rex Harrison as the spirit-plagued
author is as blithe and British as Mr.
Coward could wish; Constance Cum-
mings is suitably practical and bewildered
in turn, as the second wife; and Kay
Hammond suitably voluptuous and
ghostly as the shade of the first. And
the sum total of their efforts is the best of
light film entertainment.
Rupert Bunny.
An exhibition by Rupert Bunny at the
Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, has one
flowerpiece and 17 landscapes; the
former pleasant and undistinguished and
the landscapes, for the most part, reflect-
ing the various influences under which the
artist has fallen during a long painting
career. One, “Afternoon, Sanary,” a
gentle composition of pale sky, red,
green, brown and yellow, was bought by
the Ballarat Gallery, Victoria. Another,
“Barmes from Le Lavandou,” achieved
an impression, strong yet subdued, which
Bunny seemed to be attempting frequently
in other paintings of scenery seen from
unusual angles. The picture is charming,
trees and hills seen in warm tones and
soft undulations through a screen of
herbage—a dried crop, perhaps, or long
reeds. “Looking Towards the Pyrenees”
is snow and shadows, a fleeting effect
which yet fails to convince completely,
and “Chapel in the Hills,” despite its
obvious intention of conveying coolness
and dignity, has the same “unrounded”
appearance.
* * * *
If a hollow groaning was heard at the
opening of the show of oil paintings
(Myer Gallery, Melbourne) by past
students of the National Gallery of Vic-
toria it was because the ghost of the late
Bernard Hall had dropped in and was
contemplating the results of his 30 years
of teaching. It was Hall who said that a
modernist painting would never enter the
portals of the Gallery except over his
dead body—he once expelled a pupil for
flirting with the infected muse of modern
artists. The pictures of Lindsay Evans
infringe every one of the Hall conven-
tions. Perc Gare’s work is also an in-
fringement, but in a sounder direction.
His “Seascape, Sorrento,” is a good
attempt at an impression which shows
the influence of Max Meldrum. Mel-
drum was as much anathema to Hall as
Matisse and his friends were. One of
the few exhibits of which Hall would
have approved is the “E. A, Douglas
Watson” of Charles Bush.
* * * *
If some of the ladies exhibiting at the
37th annual exhibition of the Melbourne
Society of Women Painters (Athenaeum)
boiled eggs with the same understanding
they bring to painting pictures the hen-
fruits would be either hard-boiled or raw.
There are, of course, exceptions. There
are space and light in a flowerpiece by
Aileen Dent, and M. McChesney Mat-
hews has given some yellow and purple
irises more air to breathe than has been
vouchsafed to the Judge of the Rangoon
High Court, painted by Violet Teague.
Miss Mathews hasn’t been so successful
in her sculpture. She is evidently trying
to be primitive in her “Resignation,” a
crouching figure of a woman, and realistic
in her “Mrs. H. Peacock,” but the line
of the carving is lacking in life in both
cases. Lina Bryans’s “House in the Trees”
has life, Nora Gurdon has caught the
seaside atmosphere in “The Beach, Rose-
bud,” and there is a certain arresting
quality in the black-eyed girl of Winifred
McCubbin. But, although magnolias are
rather aggressive-looking blossoms, they
were never as blatant as Jean Sutherland
makes them.
* * * *
Although James R. Jackson (Sedon’s
Galleries, Melbourne) revels in great
panoramas and vistas of bush and moun-
tain stretching into the infinity of sky
and sunlight, his brush never gives the
effect of distance to be inferred from
the multitude of objects represented. If
the observer stays on the level of sensa-
tion his eye stops incontinently at the
surface of the canvas and doesn’t get be-
yond it, except by an intellectual effort.
* * * *
The spring show of the Society of Arts
in Adelaide is merely f.a.q., dominated
by one fine view of the northern ranges
by Max Ragless. There are two or three
good portraits, and pictures of horses;
but the Society gives no prizes this spring.

Bernborough was beaten in the Caulfield
Cup, without losing an inch of his stature as
the greatest horse racing in Australia touay.
To have carried 10.10, sevefal stone of it in
lead, and finish a good fifth in the field of 27,
after having been last with six furlongs of the
mile and a half to go, was as grand a per-
formance as anything in his great record, it
ended his sequence of wins at 15, but or
course injudiciously—he had been asked to
crack records in that line the hardest possible
way, unlike others who dodged handicaps and
huge burdens, going the softer way of w.t.a.
One measure of Bernborough’s Cup per-
formance is that Royal Gem can be rated highly
for having carried 9st. and won by a neck
from Columnist, with Two Grand next, and
Carey fourth. At the finish Bernborough was
only two and a half lengths behind the winner;
yet he was conceding the four ahead of him
respectively 241 b., 391 b., 461 b. (31b. over-
weight) and 441 b. The least Bernborough was
giving away was 201 b., and that to such a good
one as Flight, who finished far behind him.
An even better measure is provided by some
others he beat at the weights: Magnificent,
9st.; Arduli, 7.5; Chaytor, 8.8; Attley, 9.2;
The Sirdar, 7.9; Gay Lad, 8.12; First In, 8.8;
Noble Prince, 8.4, and the rest of them.
No. 6 at the barrier, Bernborough was partly
cut off in the start, but got away all right.
Mulley may have overdone letting him settle
down, or the big fellow may have been doing
a bit of a loaf on pis own account; at any
rate, by the time they had travelled the couple
of furlongs to the turn at the end of the straight
he was second last. The leader there was
Anstey, from The Sirdar, Magnificent, Leonard,
Attley, Columnist and Royal Gem. Last after
half the journey had been covered, Bern-
borough still had 20 horses in front of him
with half a mile to go. They turned intd the
straight for the home run with Columnist lead-
ing Royal Gem, Chief Pilot and Two Grand;
Bernborough taking the long way wide out,
another half-dozen horses further back, con-
tinuing a remarkable run he had started at the
half-mile.
In the straight Bernborough was twice in-
terfered with, the second time rather seriously,
when going great guns 50 yards from the post'.
These blocks and the spreading-out of the
field ahead of him as he came to the turn
contributed to his defeat. But for that he may
even have succeeded, despite his crushing
burden, which would have made any other
horse in the field almost a certainty to run
last.
•
Leaving Bernborough out of it —still in a
class by himself, since what he could do at
level weights or w.f.a. to those that beat him
would be almost pitiful—-Royal Gem won like
the good horse he also is. His 9st. was a
good horse’s weight; he was always in the
first half dozen; and, if he was getting Ist.
101 b, from the champion, he in turn was giving
over a stone to Columnist, whom he over-
hauled and held off nicely in the run to the
judge. G. Weate, who rode Columnist, was
given a three-months’ holiday by the stewards
for crossing too sharply. That the stewards
were out to impress on riders that they mean
to have as clear going as possible for runners
in the current big racing was shown by a
similar suspension of the good Melbourne rider
W. Williamson.
Now a four-year-old horse, Royal Gem is
the best son so far of the prolific sire of
winners Dhoti. Hitherto Royal Gem had been
regarded as one of the best of milers, his
distance prospects reflected in the Cup betting
of 33 to 1 against him. How much the display
of stamina may be credited to the sire must
be left to other of Dhoti’s products to de-
monstrate, Royal Gem having the advantage
of sticking quality through his dam, the Oaks
winner French Gem.
Bernborough (7 to 4 against) was only one
of the day’s favorites beaten; in fact, the only
general fancy to get home was the Sydney
filly Sweet Chime (Le Grand Duc-Korimako),
who downed Caste and Why Hurry and a good
field of other well-performed fillies in the
mile Thousand Guineas. It was a photo finish
—half-head and head —with Royal Court show-
ing her best for some time as a very close
fourth, having led till right near the end.
There was another photo finish in the seven-
furlongs Moonga Handicap, with the same
margins separating the place-getters. New
Yorker just got there, but on protest it was
awarded to Invasion Chief, with Sea Patrol
third. An idea of what a finish it was can
be had from the fact that while the photo
was being developed there was backing not only
for the place-getters but also for Nagation and
Nepal, respectively fourth and fifth!
In both the Mona Nursery (fillies) and Gwyn
Nursery (colts and geldings), the hot pops
went down, the Dhoti filly Roshanara winning
the Mona from Braesomar, with the favorite
Eba (another Dhoti) third, and the Shakuni
colt Carnage defeating the Dhoti colt Denhoti
(favorite) and the Law Maker colt Chartist
in the Gwyn. Cotham, yet another of the
Dhoti strain, won the mile Burwood Handicap
for three-year-old colts and geldings, with
Bruin and Assam (still another Dhoti) in the
places, and the favorite, Revinach, fifth, behind
the Sydney colt Smooth Action, who should
be improved by the run. Like Royal Gem,
“Better call it off for today. Wicket's still a bit sticky."
Cotham has staying blood from his dam,
Tourmente.

An aerial picture of Randwick on Saturday
would have shown a moderate crowd, evenly
spread for the most part, but gathered into
free-for-all mobs at half a dozen points. Closer
inspection of the focal point of one of these
bun-rushes would have revealed a bookie with
bulging bag “recklessly” offering 2 to 1 Bern-
borough. Interest in the Caulfield Cup rather
overshadowed the excellent racing provided
nearer at hand by City Tattersall’s Club.
The Club’s Gold Cup, contested over 11
furlongs and carrying £lOOO added money, plus
the handsome trophy, went to Kiaree, reliable
old oats-provider of the McCarten stable. Buzz
Off had the best of the start, rearing as the
barrier went up and leaping straight into his
stride. He held the lead till they turned for
home, where Silent took pver, though quickly
challenged by Kiaree. This pair fought it out
to the post, where Kiaree prevailed, while
Buzz Off held on stoutly for the minor money.
Once something of a Christmas horse, Buzz
Off has in a short time become the most con-
sistent of gallopers.
McCarten made it a double stable success
when the Bulandshar colt Son of Persia won
the following races a seven-furlongs Three-
year-old Handicap. The colt’s powerful finish
was too good for Count Cosmo, Denali and a
big field of others. Son of Persia was ridden
by E. Fordyce, who was on two winners, three
seconds and a third; only once out of a place
in the seven events.
Writing to this page recently a country
student of form commented on “that little
extra bit of dash which makes the difference
between a winner and just a plodder —a dif-
ference often noted in full blood relatives.”
A fair example of this was given in the first
division of the Novice by the full sisters
Laurette and Sonning, both by Ajax from
Bubbles. Ridden by Fordyce, Laurette won
in really good style, accounting for Lady
Contrast and Rose Glory; Sonning finished
second-last in the big field.
The second leg of the Novice went to the
Midstream gelding Bundagen (F. Williams).
Chanson Gai finished in promising style to
be third behind Doubloon.
The betting suggested that Cragsman, re-
ceiving 51b. allowance for W. Hogg, was fancied
for the six-furlongs James Clarke Stakes, but
whatever chance he had was lost when he
ran wide at the home turn. Ridden a great
race by W. Cook, and never further back than
second, Warspite won it from Earl Pentheus
and Persian Prince, who is likely to win before
long. .....
Many punters who will not hesitate to have
a lash at a Maiden Handicap with 20-odd
starters (refuse to touch early two-year-old
races, though form in the latter is usually
remarkably honest. In the J. Dowling Two-
year-old Stakes only four were considered as
chances —Druid (favorite), Nizam’s Ring, Uni-
versity and Bold Archer. They finished in that
order. Druid was ridden by J. Thompson,
who commented on the colt’s docility and
good behavior.
Starting at longish odds, Silverelda (J.
Eaves) defeated Wellington and Rouge d’Or
in the mile Welter, a particularly roughly-run
affair. Stewards opened and adjourned a
wholesale inquiry regarding several of the
runners.

The W.A. matches:
Form displayed by Hammond’s men in W.A.
hasn’t been any cause for jitters; but any side
that has Hammond in it isn’t a safe subject
for premature whooping, either. The English
skipper’s own 208 against the State team could
turn out a better guide to what’s ahead than
such performances as the woeful fielding against
the Combined XI.
The full strength of the invaders hasn’t yet
been put into the field: in the Combined XI
match Hammond withheld right-hand spin
bowlers Wright and Smith, maybe as secret
weapons for later on, and had a spell himself.
Had he been skippering there mightn’t have been
the epidemic of dropped catches, in which case
the Combined side wouldn’t have got within
coo-ee of its 462. The side had Meuleman,
Barnes and I. Johnson in it, and they respec-
tively hit up 16, 45 and 87. It was Westralian
D. Watt who belted the bowling—an inspired
157, run out; the inspiration a quid for every
run over . the century promised in a rash
moment by his father-in-law, who keeps a
pub.
Ikin bagged four of the Combined wickets,
but they cost him 172 runs. Then the Eng-
lishmen went in, and began as if bent on
proving with the bat that the dropping of
half a dozen or more catches had been no
fluke, Hutton and Fishlock being both, back
in the stand with the score only 54. Gumming
clean-bowled Hutton, and Puckett had Fishlock
caught.
Washbrook carried his score to 80 before
going l.b.w. to Dooland, who also bagged
Yardley (56), deputising for Hammond as cap-
tain, and Compton (98). Langridge’s 30 not
out was the only other respectable score.
Dooland finish with 4 for 88, Johnson with
3 for 76. It ended a draw, and the invaders
headed for Adelaide.
Batting averages at the end of the Westralian
tour were: Hammond (339, av. 169.5), Comp-
ton (182, av. 91), Yardley (101, av. 50.5), Ikin
(129, av. 43), Washbrook (169, av. 42.5), Hard-
staff (62, av. 31), Hutton (61, av. 30.5), Edrich
(49, av. 24.5), Gibb (72, av. 24), Fishlock
(63, av. 21). The wickets fell to Smith (13
for 205), Edrich (9 for 144), Voce (6 for 126),
■Wright (6 for 118), Ikin (5 for 225), Langridge
(3 for 118), Pollard (2 for 82), and Bedser
(1 for IJ6).’ The bowling figures are certainly
not flattering.
In all four W.A. matches M.C.C. scored
1385 for 30 wickets, against 1208 for 47
wickets. Washbrook and Ikin played in all
of them, and every member of the side had
at least one game. Hammond’s 208 knock
brought his centuries in first-class cricket to
166 and double centuries in ditto to 35.
D. Watt’s 157 (he was missed three times)
was the highest to date by a Westralian
against England, eclipsing Horrocks’s 140,
made against Allen’s .team in 1936. Com-
bined’s 462 also wiped off the record slate
the 436 scored in that same match.
G. Powell and W. Beath, a couple of young
players doing well with Randwick in Sydney
grade matches, get their chance with N.S.W.
v. Queensland at Brisbane on Oct. 25. A
breezy 132 for Gordon v. Petersham pushed
Pettiford (the lone man of the Services XI)
into the side at the eleventh hour. The Digger
scored 1040 runs, averaging 24.19, on the Ser-
vices tour, with highlights of 124 in the first
Test v. India at Bombay and 101 in the second
Test at Calcutta.

Alan Waterson, the lightweight Moore
Park (Sydney) golfer, is this year’s Aus-
tralian amateur champion, winning the
title from J. Pendergast at Royal Sydney
after being runner-up to H. W. Pickworth
(Manly) in the Open. The final was
played in a gale with occasional whips of
rain, but Waterson’s iron play, always
his strong point, didn’t falter. He was
three up at the turn and finished two up
and one after saving the 33rd with a
60-yard pitch-and-run to within four
inches of the cup. Waterson beat Jim
Ferrier in 1939 and Doug. Davies in 1940
for the N.S.W. amateur championship.
* * * *
At 45, Joe Davis is putting up his cue.
He has a record that should last: since
the snooker championship was first played
in 1927 he has never been beaten in a
championship match. He held the
billiards championship, too, from 1928 till
1933, when Walter Lindrum happened
along to prove himself the greatest the
game has ever known. Davis’s retirement
is all the more surprising because he has
lost none of his cunning at the potting
game, as shown in the lacings he’s been
giving to such a good one as Horace
Lindrum.

Malayan Kid Pancho (9st.) was too
pugnacious for Danny Simmons (9st.
4ilb.) at Leichhardt, outfighting the local
youth in all 12 rounds for a clear points
win. What spice there was in it wasn’t
that of variety. Every round was Pancho
attacking, Simmons defending. Weak-
ened by body punches, Simmons looked
like being knocked at any time over the
last three rounds, but the Malayan
couldn’t connect with a finaliser.

Not yet long enough in the tooth to
know much about “stalling,” Mickey
Tollis (9st. 121 b.) and Charlie Ashenden
(9st. 10ilb.) fought like wildcats at

an ashen hue for the seventh, was twice
floored for long counts, and when he
went down once more Wallis declared

The Coming Budget
A Budget will be the first responsibility
of the Chifley Government when Parlia-
ment meets in November. One should
have been presented before the elections,
but the Ministry chose to defer it; for
one thing the Budget papers would have
revealed many items of expenditure for
last year not disclosed in summaries pub-
lished, and, in any case, Chifley and Co.
seemed to value the freedom in counter-
ing the Liberal party’s tax-reduction in-
tentions which an unpresented Budget
gave them. But November is a shock-
ingly late time of the year to present
financial proposals for a period which
started on July 1 and ends June 30 next
year. Such carefree delay clearly indi-
cates that political considerations are too
easily put by Labor at Canberra before
economic demands.
The Federal Budget has grown vastly
in importance during the war. At one
period it was almost 10 times as large as
in 1938-39, and in 1945-46 expenditure
was still about eight times the last pre-
war total. Canberra nowadays handles
nearly half the national income, spending
much of it, and redistributing some of it
in the way of “social security.” It thus
follows that what plans the Government
has behind its annual budgeting are of the
greatest importance to the individual. In
its taxings, its borrowings, its spendings,
its redistribution of incomes and its
economic controls that have become part
and parcel of its Budget arrangements,
Canberra has become a major factor in
the existence and prospects of every
citizen. This is especially so when it
shows itself unable, on the other hand,
to guarantee industrial discipline.
Out of the accident of war (which
forced upon us a virtually totalitarian
way of living), the Federal Government
had to take upon itself an almost detailed
direction of our whole economy. That it
appears still to want to do so is evident
from its request for additional consti-
tutional powers at two refcrendums and
from its reluctance to forgo the sway it
possesses over our lives through excessive
taxation and heavy spending.
Mr. Chifley at the beginning of the
campaign referred to the Menzies election
promise of a 20 p.c. tax cut by January
1 next as political bribery, but later on,
influenced by the popularity with which
Mr. Menzies was personally received in
most parts of the Commonwealth, himself
made some indefinite promises to reduce
taxation.
The Government is faced with two
tasks of an urgent nature. One is to reduce
taxation as rapidly as possible. The other
is to balance the Budget. It has shown
no great celerity in trying to do either.
In a financial statement to the Repre-
sentatives on July 12 Mr. Chifley said:
Most of our resources are free once
again for civil production, and full employ-
ment of these, steadily maintained, can work
wonders in output. Then, as output and
real income rise, taxation can be reduced
still further. It has been our policy to
remove all forms of control which tend
to hinder genuine business dealings and the
production of essentials. But we remain
inflexibly opposed to those false induce-
ments which inflated prices and excessive
profits would give.
From a study of that statement it would
appear to be Mr. Chifley’s policy not to
reduce the volume of tax revenue, but to
wait for a rise in national production and
income so that tax rates can be reduced
without affecting the total of revenue. It
would also appear to be plain that tax
cuts will not be given as an incentive to
create production—the increased produc-
tion has to come first, in Mr. Chifley’s
view. That is all very nice if it turns out
“No, I didn't ring—and Mr. Ikeystein has just gone out”
that way. But so far it is not working
out to plan.
Mr. Chifley has confused the issue by
including in one paragraph references
both to taxation and to price-control.
“Inflated profits and excessive prices” are
not desirable, of course. But it is desir-
able that private enterprise should be
allowed to make reasonable profits, and
that those profits should not be taxed so
harshly as to dull all incentive to stimu-
late production. This taxation issue has
nothing to do with excessive profits or
price-control.
But, from the businessman’s point of
view, there has been a most disheartening
neglect of his interests by the taxation
authorities and under the system of price-
control which operates. In both cases it
is Caucus more than the officials con-
cerned that are responsible for the de-
mands made upon the proprietary side
of industry in order to maintain the price
ceiling and to keep the flow of taxation
coming in to meet all kinds of inflated
Government expenditure. The Govern-
ment continues to tax the forces of pro-
duction at a higher rate than it does the
forces of spending. And it pegs prices
far more scrupulously than it does wages.
It is not greatly concerned, apparently,
when wage-earners fail really to deliver
the goods in return for their pay.
The importance of a balanced Budget
should be realised when it is remembered
that there was a Budget deficit of £153
million last year. In other words. Gov-
ernment spending exceeded tax and other,
revenue by a sum twice as great as all
Federal Budget expenditure in 1938-39.
The deficit had to be covered by borrow-
ings. This borrowing has not the same
security as money raised to finance repro-
ductive public works. It is spent on ex-
penses of government of various kinds,
and there is no Governmentally-owned
asset resulting from it. Obviously it is
a type of finance that should be discon-
tinued as speedily as possible.
An unbalanced Budget, justifiable in
war-time, is now becoming a danger-
signal of excessive Government spending.
This excessive spending is a burden on
the people and an obstruction to indus-
try, upon which production and employ-
ment depend. An unbalanced Budget in-
creases the debt burden, adds to the in-
flation danger when bank credit is used,
and aids the forces of socialism by making
conditions difficult for private enterprise,
since the greater the Government debt
the greater its hold over the community;
and the greater the interest bill the
heavier the taxation of industry. •
The progress the Labor Government
makes in reducing taxation and balancing
the Budget will be a measure of the suc-
cess of its administration. They' represent
opposite ’ ends of one problem, and pro-
vide a real test of ability to help the
whole national economy back to full
production and stable finance. There are
those among us who sneer at the idea
of a balanced Budget, but, as a rule, the
outlook of such people is usually non-
productive, non-debt-paying and para-
sitical.
The State Premiers have agreed to a
continuance of capital-issues control for
at least three years. It was decided to
transmute Commonwealth defence powers
on the subject into, eventually, uniform
State controls, which would embrace not
only capital issues, but also mortgages
and interest rates generally. The Premiers
also agreed that something should be
done towards making State company laws
uniform and bringing legislation up to
date. Price-control continuation as a
Commonwealth responsibility is still held
in suspense by the refusal of the Tas-
manian Legislative Council to approve the
necessary delegation of powers. The
National Security Act runs out on Dec.
31, and it will be essential to do some-
thing about price-control, even if modi-
fications are necessary from time to time.
The have been discussing the
desirability of allowing an increase in the
permitted price at which real estate may
be sold. There are a considerable number
of Federal controls which should be
allowed to go overboard on Dec. 31, and
one of them is the restriction on the prices
of Stock Exchange securities. Other coun-
tries have succeeded in controlling in-
terest rates and new capital issues without
fixing arbitrary prices on established in-
vestments.

Tasmania went to the Grants Com-
mission for £219,478, the amount of its
Budget deficit, for 1945-46. The com-
mission knocked out of the claim
£100,482, representing sinking-fund and
other payments to liquidate losses arising
from the revaluation of soldier- and closer-
settlement properties and to meet the cost
of exchange on repatriated London loans.
Tasmania, the commission recommends,
should be given assistance totalling
£118,996. In addition, £646,000 was re-
ceived by way of special grant during the
currency of the financial year. The
amount to be received under the unpre-
sented 1946-47 Federal Budget is not yet
known, but it is expected by Treasurer
Cosgrove to run to £825,000.

The owners of a building containing two lifts recently signed a Waygood-
Otis Maintenance Contract. Our maintenance engineers then made a
thorough inspection of the lifts-and were amazed to find that the two dowel
pins which hold the worm to the worm shaft of one machine had sheared
off. One pin was lying on the bottom of the gear case and the holding
power of the other pin—although still in place—was declining rapidly.
The machine was shut down immediately and repairs were effected . . .
thanks to the introduction of Waygood-Otis Maintenance, a highly
dangerous condition was corrected in the nick of time.

Some people still aren’t well ac-
quainted with the financial arrangements
behind the leading Australian whisky-
distilling and -distributing organisation.
Federal Distilleries Pty. took over, in
1924, several Victorian distilleries, in-
cluding those of Australian Distillery
Co., Brinds, Breheny Bros, and Kenna’s
and C.W.L. Pty., concentrating activities
at Port Melbourne. This became the
“Old Court” side of things. Later an
opposition set up in the shape of the
Corio distillery, established by the Dis-
tillers Co., Ltd., Edinburgh (with the co-
operation of some Australian distributing
interests), and completed by 1928. The
new enterprise was floated into a co. —
the Distillers Corporation Pty, In 1930
Federal Distilleries and the new co,
amalgamated. United Distillers Pty. was
formed, and it acquired the scrip in the
two operating cos., after a gerferal in-
crease in capital. The original Australian
holding cos., after a return of capital
in cash, were left with a small in-
terest in United Distillers Pty.—Aus-
tralian Distillery p.c. and another
1\ p.c. by Brinds and Breheny Bros.
The rest of the £1,050,000 of shares
issued by United Distillers Pty. is con-
trolled by the Distillers Co., Ltd., of
Edinburgh. Over the war years profits
of the operating cos. have risen sharply.
In the year to January 31, 1939, £18,533
was earned by the Port Melbourne and
Corio distilleries. In the 1945 term the
figure rose to £95,711. The Corio end
of the business is considerably the larger
contributor to profits. In 1944-45 the
consumption of Australian whisky was
greater than the quantity of all whisky,
including Scotch, drunk in 1938-39.
Whisky, Australian and imported, is still
difficult to get, though gin, which is also
turned out by the Distillers Corporation,
is in plentiful supply.

Iron-ore production in South Australia
during 1945 was about 1,500,000 tons,
compared with a peak of 2,500,000 tons
in 1939. The Whyalla blast furnace was
idle during the year owing to a shortage
of coal and coke, but it was restarted on
March 19, 1946, coke being shipped from
N.S.W. and limestone from Rapid Bay.
Capacity of the furnace is 650 tons of
pig-iron daily. The general shortage of
imported coal in South Australia has led
to the development of the Leigh Creek
deposits of sub-bituminous fuel, which
will be controlled by the State Electricity
Trust. Experiments with the coal, accord-
ing to reports by the Adelaide Chamber
of Commerce, show that it can be burnt
satisfactorily at a cost which compares
favorably with N. S. Wales coal, and
the majority of consumers are able to use
it with slight modifications to plant.
Over 50,000 tons of the coal was used
in the six months to June 30 last. The
Mines Department is now investigating
brown-coal deposits at Moorlands.

The cost of war and “war” to Aus-
tralia from Sept. 3, 1939, to Sept. 30 this
year was £2545 million, net outgo for
September adding £27.3 million. The ex-
tent to which offsetting items of income
were used to reduce the net amount of
“war” outgo during July and August is
shown by the fact that the September
expenditure figure is nearly equal to the
net total for the previous two months.
Of the running total of £2545 million to
Sept. 30, £994 million was paid for out
of taxes and £1551 million out of loans.
The bank-credit debt for war purposes on
Sept. 30 was £313 million, while £3 mil-
lion was also raised in this way for
“works.”

The State Grants (Tax; Reimbursement)
Act of 1946 replaces the 1942 uniform-
tax legislation passed by the Common-
wealth Government. The Premiers re-
sisted the Federal plan “to be perman-
ently bought out of the income-tax field
for a fixed maximum payment of £4 17s.
6d. per head per annum.” Under the
scheme eventually decided on the States
will receive in each of the base years
1946-47 and 1947-48 an aggregate grant
of £4O million (against £33 million last
year). The initial grant of £4O million
a year is to.grow as the population of
each State grows and as the national in-
come increases. National income will
be measured by average wages per per-
son employed. Commonwealth and State
Statisticians being called in to make cal-
culations.

Among companies eager to exploit the
opportunities for business and industrial
expansion in Auckland, N.Z., are Gordon
and Gotch, which plans to build premises
with 25,000 sq. ft. of floor space, more
than double the size of the present ware-
house, for distribution of books and
periodicals; William Cable and Co., of
Wellington, which will increase capital
from £150,000 to £400,000 to make a big
drive for engineering leadership; and
Turnbull and Jones, Ltd., of Wellington,
which sees a big future in the electricity
trade. But the outstanding building
scheme which should be first away when
controls are relaxed enough will be that
of the State-owned Bank of N.Z. The
combined bank and office block is de-
signed to overshadow Auckland’s finest
buildings. Auckland has years of hectic
activity ahead to overtake arrears of
building and meet post-war needs.

Commonwealth Government securities,
including Tfeasury bills, held by the
Commonwealth Savings Bank at June 30
last, totalled £373 million, an increase of
£69 million in a year. The figure has
grown by approximately £266 million
since 1941, though the bank has adopted
the bad habit of altering its balance-sneet
groupings slightly in different years, thus
making comparisons to some extent un-
certain. A great deal of bank credit has
been created during the war through the
medium of savings-bank subscriptions to
public loans, expanding the credit base
rather than curbing spending power of
the public. About 54 p.c. of all public
loans offered by the Curtin and Chifley
Governments were subscribed by Govern-
ment funds a'nd the banks, principally
savings banks.

Masonite ord. shares have held their
place all during the Stock Exchange set-
back, quotations keeping firmly around
345. 6d., ex the half-yearly dividend.
Earnings have been restricted by price-
control, but net profit has advanced
satisfactorily from £38,718 to £44,058
(£31,900 belonging to ords., £12,158 to
deferreds) over the past couple of years,
even though the new plant (which should
duplicate output) will not be in operation
until next year. A further reduction in
prices to the public was made on May 1,
partly as a result of low-price Govern-
ment orders diminishing. There is a
great demand for the product, and build-
ing activity should keep it high for years
to come. The ord. div. of 8 p.c. gives the
investor at 345. 6d. a present yield of £4
13s. per cent.

With the termination of the British
Government Acquisition Scheme on
June 30 a total of seven wool clips had
been handled, 24 million bales being
dealt with for about £458 million, with
another £lO million to be added for
sheepskins. The scheme terminated with
4 million bales of old stock in store in
Australia, to be handled by Joint Organ-
isation. Other old stock is stored in
Britain and elsewhere. The average price
paid by Britain during the war was
13.4 d. (Australian) a pound during the
seasons 1939-40 to 1941-42 and 15.45 d.
from 1942-43 to 1945-46. Profits on dis-
posals were to have been shared by
Britain and Australia, but the Common-
wealth Government has been taking the
grower’s portion in practice,. Wool is
now being disposed of under an Empire
plan, with the Australian reserve price
fixed at 18.15 d. during the current sea-
son, subject to a contributory charge of
5 p.c. Costs of operating “Joint Organ-
isation” will be borile partly by the in-
dustry (through the contributory charge)
and partly by J. 0., all finances for each
Dominion’s wool being kept separate.
The Commonwealth Government has
assumed half-ownership of Australian-
grown wool held by the British Govern-
ment at July 31, 1945, and the two Gov-
ernments will provide equal funds for
buying-in new wool, if required, to sup-
port the reserve price. Profits and losses
under the plan will be shared equally by
the British and Commonwealth Govern-
ments.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Old-timer”: Old Bill’s eyesight was
failing badly, but he wouldn’t admit it,
and anyone who hinted that he should
obtain spectacles risked insult, if not
violence. Bill seemed to think that an
admission of failing eyesight was a sissy
sort of thing, just as other men will hang
on to poisonous molars or refuse to see
a doctor about persistent stomach pains.
The way we covered up his mistakes in
mustering, on the wool-floor or when
driving the team would have confounded
those who believe bushmen aren’t senti-
mental. Even when Bill hit the town,
got beered up and hit the policeman, we
persuaded the offended officer that he’d
been mistaken for someone else. In the
hut we did small things for him, like put-
ting the matches under his hand and
keeping obstructions out of his way, be-
cause Bill was a most likeable chap ; but
sometimes he tried us severely, as on the
occasion when, sent to muster a distant
paddock, he brought home 1100 strange
wethers. The climax came when he van-
ished one Sunday afternoon and wasn’t
discovered until Monday night, when the
wood-and-water joey found him at the
bottom of the disused and dry under-
ground tank behind the woolshed. He’d
seen the circular black hole, all right, but
mistook it for a patch of shade and
went to lie down in it. He got out of it
with some bruises, a broken wrist and a
fright big enough to send him. in to the
travelling oculist next time he visited the
town.
* * ♦ *
“Zake”: As exuberantly joyous a
sound as you’ll hear in the bush is the
peal of bell-like notes that come from the
buff-striped, brown tree-creeper as he
prospects his way up a new arboreal
claim. They are the closest that we have
in the bird world to the woodpecker of the
northern hemisphere. Possibly they were
true woodpeckers once, but trying to dig
into ironbark, box and stringybark must
have discouraged them, for our tree-
creepers build their nests under loose
strips of bark.
* ♦ ♦ ♦ ,
“P. Ton”: According to my Australian
Encyclopaedia the cabbage-gum {E.
coriacea ) is a cold-country species. In a
recent short story by “Standby,” set in
country 100 miles north of Cooktown
(Q.), with a tidal creek and crocodiles
thrown in for good measure, the vege-
table’s presence was mentioned. The
encyclopaedia or the cabbage-gums are
astray, or has the gum become accli-
matised in the north of late?
* * * *
“Bo”: When Alec and Tim Mostyn,
bachelor brothers, first settled on their
heavily-timbered block they cleared it
sufficiently to put up a roomy wattle-and-
daub shack and proceeded gradu-
ally to extend the cultivation area. Then
Coleman set up a sawmill and started to
denude the surrounding country of its
trees. When the best of his own Com-
mercial stuff had been cut out Coleman
offered the Mostyns a fair price for their
stands of bluegum “on the hoof.” They
accepted with alacrity, being anxious to
put the area under fruit. Soon Coleman
had a team of fellers on the job. One
day the brothers came back to the shack
at lunch time from a session of grubbing.
They noticed a new feller busy on a big
bluegum fairly close at hand, but with-'
out comment went in to prepare their
meal. Ten minutes later there came a
tearing, cracking sound followed by a
squealing “whoosh” that seemed to be un-
comfortably close. They dashed out. Two
seconds after they had leaped for safety
the big stick had flattened the shack.
For a moment they went white, then
pop-eyed as they'gazed on their ruined
home ; then they luridly demanded to
be t<3ld why the soanso the stupid
blankard hadn’t found out which way
the adjectival tree would fall before he
started. The new feller’s face wore a
look of astonishment at the end of the
tirade. “Cripes,” he said, “can you tell
which way a tree’s goin’ to fall?”
* * * *
“C. Sandy”; “Zake’s” horse (B.
25/9/’46) that dug to get at the couch-
grass roots was probably suffering from
cystitis or an irritated bladder and was
seeking relief. The active principle of the
roots of couch grass— triticin —is used in
medicine as a demulcent and diuretic.
* * * *
“Esk D.”; To bring in the herd for
milking McKenna whistles a loud, shrill
blast from back verandah. Immedi-
ately the cows jerk heads up and break
into a wild gallop for the yard. As they
pass it may be noticed that half of them
have docked tails. “That’s me savage
dawg,” McKenna says. “A blue heeler
that chivvied ’em an’ rode swingin’ on
their tails. Bluey’s bin dead a year now,
but the milkers still aren’t takin’ any
chances.”
» “Tick”; Old Dick’s blue heeler had
been an invaluable help around the farm
and his sudden death beneath the wheels
of a visiting truck was a real blow to
the old cove and his missus. Further, a
"D yer think this rail-unification scheme'll affect us, ’Arry ?”
replacement didn’t seem to be available.
So when Charlie’s dog from the next
section took to visiting the bails it was
encouraged to the,extent that very soon
it spent more time at Dick’s place than
at home. Then came the day when
Charlie claimed and chained his own.
Since then Dick has never ceased to rant
about that “thievin’, scroungin’, no-good
Charlie Wilson.”

“Crow”: Queerest and most effective
scarecrow I’ve seen was a small tubular
whistle worked from compressed air. The
bloke who used it told me that most
« animals and birds have a range of hear-
ing which extends well above that of
human beings, so he’d had the whistle
designed to work in supersonic range.
When he first started using it he had a
couple of casualties in the chook run and
his usually quiet old mare bolted
round the yard like mad. Nowadays he
only gives a blast occasionally and it’s
uncanny to watch him pull the cord and
see whatever birds there are in the
vicinity make frantic efforts to leave for
parts unknown. Incidentally, his orchard
is the least damaged by birds in the
district.
“Puyyaka”: The warning by “D.R.H.”
(B. 25/9/’46) against risk of hydatid in-
fection from petting dogs applies also to
cats and foxes, other possible hosts of the
adult worm. His reference to resultant
cysts “which may be as big as an orange”
sadly understates the fell work on the
human liver of which hydatid larvae are
capable. Now a comparatively rare
disease, probably by reason of country
water supplies being better protected
from fouling by. dogs and fewer oppor-
tunities for dogs to become infected by
feeding on dead stock, 50 years ago no
general surgical ward was complete with-
out its case of hydatid of some part of
the human body. Liver cysts the siz6 of
a big melon and containing anything up
to 201 b. or more of fluid and daughter-
cysts were not uncommon. The lungs,
abdominal cavity, brain and bone-marrow
were other frequent areas of invasion.
Students were taught to include hydatids
as one of the first probabilities in any
unusual illness. Excepting only Iceland,
Australia had the highest incidence of
hydatids in the world. Its modern treat-
ment is mainly the work of Australian
surgeons.

“Nagheer”: Those N.T, kangaroos
certainly # do seem to need a bit of watch-
ing nowa’days. It is not very long since
one of them nearly scared the life out
of an important bureaucratic visitor by
jumping on the bonnet of his car in broad
daylight. Now, another of the mis-
chievous hoppers has shot a stockman on
Tipperary station, in the Adelaide River
country. Having wounded it, he decided
to put it out of its misery, using the butt
of his rifle to hold its head down while he
reached for a handy waddy. While run-
ning up to the animal he had reloaded
and recocked his weapon. The ’roo
promptly reached up a forepaw, pulled
the trigger and got its man through the
upper part of his right arm. ,

“Bray Rock”: Why all the uproar
from “Nor’-west” (B. 25/9/’46) about
“merely an angler”? The Oxford Dic-
tionary defines the verb “angle” as “fish
with hook and bait,” and that’s all he
does with his clothesline and three sheep-
hooks. Here in S.Q. waters we use
heavy lines and multiple hooks —anything
up to a dozen on occasion—when the
fish are schooling and hungry, but it is
during the long spells in between that
skill and light gear keep the pot boiling
when his hawsers and skulldragging
would leave it cold. With our more
sophisticated fish we even find that
stamping or other noisy movement in the
boat lessens the catch, particularly in
night fishing. But “N.” will find out
these things for himself some day when
his grounds become depleted by over-
fishing for the needs of a much larger
market than any in W.A. at present, just
as ours have become except when new
schools arrive at certain seasons. As for
gutting, with a properly built stand, a
suitable and sharp knife and the requisite
skill, that needn’t average more than 30
seconds per fish.

“Dronestung”; The longleaf box (E.
oleophora), a gnarled and stunted euca-
lypt which ekes out an existence on
barren slopes, has usually a stumpy
barrel of a trunk with several long,
twisted arms bearing sparse branchlets
with large, thick leaves. When young
the leaves are frosted bluish-white, vary-
ing from long oval to round, and some
are almost as big as a man’s hand. The
bark is typical of the box family; the
timber hard and very brittle: the
trunks mostly hollow as a drum. The
umbels of blossoms are in the shape of a
six-pointed star and one in the centre,
and the honey from these trees is first
class. They are good, too, for gathering
wild bees’ nests, providing large, clean
hollows, with the hive close to the ground.
* * * *
“Narrin”: A very great Englishman
devoted a lifetime of hard work to show-
ing that, although the offspring of given
parents tend to resemble dad and mum,
there are also perceptible and significant
differences between junior and the old
folks —the differences being sometimes so
marked as to produce a real freak. He
showed also that sometimes the freak
had a better chance of survival than dad
and mum and, consequently, lived long
and produced many freakish offspring, to
the ultimate betterment of the species.
Well, the other night •! wanted a rabbit,
but, by the time I’d walked a mile down
to the gum creek, it was too dark to see
the elusive bunny except when he
streaked off to his subterranean flats.
Then, unexpectedly, I met two white
rabbits and, by good luck and some waste
of cartridges, potted both as the deluded
beasts squatted to hide from me. Now it
must be a long, long time since the first
freak rabbit with a brown-grey coat was
born. From that moment other colors,
at least in temperate climates, were out
of date. But those natural laws that
Darwin traced out so patiently are still at
work, culling out the chromatic bunnies
which still occur, but which usually come
to a sticky end before they’ve left many
easily-seen descendants.

“Mat’s Mate”: The contract was
shovelling river gravel into motor trucks
and we went out to have a look at it.
The boss wasn’t enthusiastic about
my 10-stone being able to keep up with
Mat’s 13.6 and remarked dubiously, “It’s
pretty heavy going, you know. You’ll be
up to the knees in slush and there’s three
30-hundred-weight trucks to keep going
with only a mile run to the railway
trucks.” Mat ignored this. “Y’re payin’
a bob a yard, ain’t y’?” he asked. “Yes,”
replied the boss. “But it’s not that.
You’ve got to keep those trucks going.
Can’t afford to have ’em waiting.” “What
makes y’ think we’ll keep ’em waitin’?”
Mat demanded. The boss hesitated, then
he came out with it. “Aw, I reckon
you’d be all right,” he said. “But your
mate’s a bit light on, isn’t he?” “Here,”
I declared, belligerently, “I’ll shovel
against the best man y’ve got all day fr
a coupler quid.” “Forget it,” Mat
snapped at me. “We ain’t takin’ the
job. A bloke who picks his workers on
size wouldn’t know a good job from a
bad one. Come on.” So we headed out
into the wheat country.

“Codar”; Among the scores of magpies
driven into town by drought and bush-
fires in our S.Q. district is one with a
leg missing. At first he arrived regularly •
at the back steps when scraps were put
out, accompanied by two others, who
kept off all comers until he had his share.
Then one day one of the guards gobbled
a piece before the proper time. Immedi-
ately the whole flock, which had been '
hovering in the background, hopped in
and gave the culprit a hiding before chas-
ing him off. Hoppie now has only a
single escort, but none of the others
attempts to cut in until the “open go”
signal has been given.

“Frank Mauri”: The talk was of
record loads and long hauls, of the
strength of shatters and intelligence of
leaders in the old wool teams. Jim
pointed his pipe stem towards a dim grey
shape feeding from the shaft-trough.
“See that old leader of mine?” he said.
“Well, we were pulling a big load up
Bloomfield Hill once and at the third
bend the offside drawbar broke. The
wagon started to move backward, pulling
the team with it. But old Prince reached
out and grabbed a tuft of grass with his
teeth. Yair, he hung-on till I got the
brakes screwed on,”

“E.V.S.”: The illusion of the rising full
moon’s greater size has puzzled the
curious for many years, but no com-
pletely satisfactory answer has yet been
afforded. The commonly accepted ex-
planation—that of comparison with
terrestrial objects—lacks conviction, for
the illusion persists even on a Calm, cloud-
less night at sea where there is no object
for comparison. Photography disposes of
the theory of atmospheric magnification.
Scientific measurement shows the illumi-
nated surface to be slightly smaller at
rising. The eye is not at fault, for the
image implanted on the retina is accurate.
It therefore follows that the mental in-
terpretation is incorrect, for we see actu-
ally not by the eye but with the mind.
Why are we thus deluded? It would
appear that we have always been accus-
tomed to measure along a horizontal
rather than a vertical plane. The rising
moon, so far away yet so brilliant, must,
we reason, be big; when overhead we
conclude it to be nearer, and the mind
judges it to be smaller, but ignores the
fact that its traverse is curved, not flat-
tened from the horizon. We see what
we think, often erroneously.

“Uramao”: Henare had come into
sudden affluence, and his first thought was
to acquire a car. Disregarding all ex-
aminations for fitness for a licence, he
took his cash purchase out on to the
main road and attempted to lower Mal-
colm Campbell’s speed record. An hour
or so later he limped the garage
from which he’d bought it and thus un-
burdened himself, “I trive te pig red
car to te pub, py te whisky and feel
goodo. Step on te gas and te trees go
py. Soon I see te pig pridge cornin’ flat
out at me down te road. I turn off to
let him go past. Pang! Car in te ditch
on top of me. Gimme a petter car.
How much?”
BREAM WATER.
Rough white water a fathom deep over the
bar of sand;
Flowing tide and clouded moon with a breeze
from the shrouded land:
There, on the edge of the ocean’s bound, while
other men sleep and snore,
The fisherman stands by the whispering sea
as it sweeps up the sloping shore.
And he knows that out in the running foam,
where the white-capped wave is curled.
Somewhere, seeking for prawn or worm, is
the finest bream in the world.
So he prays to the night and the ctouded
moon, as he holds to his quivering line,
“O king of the murmuring mighty sea, I pray
let this bream be mine!”
The hook is baited and cunningly cast to the
hole at the sand-bar’s side,
Where surely the finest bream will search and
swim-with the flowing tide.
Clouds draw back from the .moon’s fair face,
and light on the water gleams,
A silver flash from the breaking wave, and
foam from the rock-shelf streams.
The thoughts of the fisherman seaward go, in
the manner of all his kin;
He is not of the earth as he patiently stands;
’ he is one with the scale and fin;
And he knows that out in the running foam,
where thp white-capped wave is curled.
Somewhere, seeking for prawn or worm, is the
finest bream in the world.

“Moyhu”: Compared with his overseas
forebears, our Reynard is a poor speci-
men, having degenerated sadly since tak-
ing up residence in this country. Accus-
tomed for centuries t<y the soft daylight
of northern European countries, the eyes
of the sagacious one have never suc-
ceeded in adjusting themselves to the
vivid Australian light, a defect largely
responsible for his reputation as one of
the easiest-to-come-by of our game
animals. The prowler’s preference for
black fowls (B. 25/9/’46) is partly ex-
plained by the fact that, to his nocturnal
eye, white is simply non-exjstent, the
darker colors alone having “body.” An-
other reason is the “gamey” quality of
the darker-fleshed fowl, which intimation
is conveyed through the nose and not the
eye. The runt will touch white poultry

if there are none other to be had, but in
this case he relies wholly on sense of
smell, his one faculty unimpaired by the
harsh conditions obtaining in this coun-
try,

“Shamuseen”: Some feet up the trunk
of many trees in S.Q. are to be seen dis-
colored patches. Close examination
shows these to be plugs sealing a hole
which goes about two inches into the
trunk. If the plug is dug out it will be
found to consist of chewed wood fibre,
compressed into cylindrical shape. The
engineer responsible for the boring and
sealing of the tunnel is’ the borer or wood-
m6th. The tunnel is a safe deposit for
her eggs, which are stored at the inner
extremity of the cache. How the
hatched-out grubs make their debut, in
the face of the wooden plug, is something
I haven’t worked out. The cocoon of
another S.Q. moth offers another example
of Nature’s carpentry. The fibrous co-
coon envelope is evenly covered by a
series of parallel slivers of wood. These
are. gummed together so neatly and sym-
metrically by some natural cement that
they form a completely protective
wooden cylinder for the cocoon,

“T.W.H.”: “Zake’s” explanation of
the origin of Degilbo (Q.) —reversal of
the word “obliged”—(B. 2/10/ ’46) may
seem watertight, yet Degilbo is aborigi-
nal in origin. It is the name of the
terminus of the second section of thfe
Gayndah railway, which terminus
took its title from a cattle station of
which the railway-station site was a
part. The name of the cattle station
was adopted from the aboriginal
name of a rock-bound waterfall in
the scrub when W. H. Walsh first
occupied it in 1848, over 45 years
before the railway was established.
The word is derived from “dugil-bu,”
or “du-gilbop,” meaning “stones
standing up,” from dugil, stone, and
bu, a contraction of bubal. This in-
formation was given by E, Hastings,
an octogenarian resident of Mary-
borough, who, as a lad, lived at
Degilbo. It is confirmed by F, J. Wat-
son in bis Four Vocabularies of South-
east Queensland.

tor who sang at the school concert.
“He’s a barrertone, I reckon,” said Dan.
“No fear,” Andy said. “Didn’t y’ hear

Tommy thought he could’ve been a “base

heads,” Big Alf laughed. “Gripes* y’

“X.E.D.”: Long Alec bowled into the
store and asked whether Joe had time
to cut his hair. “Orright,” muttered Joe.
As he made preliminary passes with the
scissors it was plain he had a grievance,
and at last he opened out. “There’s not
much sense in y’ bein’ pigheaded, Alec,”
he said. “I told y’ after y’d been in town
t’ the sheep sales a year ago an’ let a
barber down there cut y’r hair it don’t

cuts t’ git y’r poll into decent shape agen,

“Frank Mauri”: “Contour cultivation,!’
which has recently come into prominence
as a method of soil-erosion control, has
been practised for generations by the
Bubus, a tribe of primitive people who
live in a series of narrow and steep valleys
on the border of Papua and the Mandated
Territory. The streams rush down as
cascades and rapids and have long since
cut their beds down to the solid granite.
Along the banks of these creeks and
rivers, sometimes on an angle of 45
degrees, are the hanging gardens of the
Bubus. Heavy tropical rains falling on
these steep hillsides would long ago have
washed away the thin topsoil but for
their ingenious methods of cultivation.
Before a native attempts to turn a sod he
builds a thick fence of canegrass and
withies which strictly follows the contours
of the hill. When this is completed he
digs up the soil for 10 or 12 feet uphill
from the fence. Then he builds another
fence, also following the contour. When
finished the garden is sectioned off every
few yards by these fences. A fence at
each end completes the job by making it
pig-proof. Rainwater rushing down the
grassy slopes is arrested by the topmost
fence, and before it can get up speed
again across the garden it is stopped by
the next fence; any soil picked up is
filtered off as the water seeps slowly
through the thick grass mat; By the time
“Could y ’ put the new slaughteryards in? It'd be a snifter ad.
for the shire.”
the crop, usually sweet potatoes or yams,
is harvested, the fences show signs of de-
cay, but they last long enough for the
grass and vines to grow over and bind the
torn-up soil. Eventually the fences slowly
collapse and rot away. Where each one
stood remains a raised line of humus and
strained soil. The grass protects the land
from further erosion until it is cultivated
again. The marked contour lines of old
fences stand out very clearly for years like
' furrow marks and are a puzzle to
strangers.

“Hanko”: We classed the place as a
good tucker joint when we sat down to a
meal of corned-beef and carrot (singu-
lar). The carrot was soft and flavorsome.
“Gripes,” said my mate. “That’s a good
carrot; it must have been the size of a
mangold.” The old cockie beamed his
pleasure. “So it oughter bin a good
carrot,” he said, “considerin’ I growed
it on a rat that got drounded in the water-
tank.”
* * i * *
“Aerogenes”: I would join issue with
“Bufo” (B. 2/10/’46) on the subject of
Bakewell. Not on the main issue, as he
certainly did pioneer stock-breeding, but
the cattle he bred made no difference to
Australia. Admittedly he made vast im-
provements in his cattle, but they were of
the Longhorn type, which, supplanted by
other breeds, has sunk into disuse. It
was the Shorthorn, developed by his
pupils and their followers, which took the
lead among British cattle and was of so
much value to us. Bakewell simply line-
bred to an ideal type, culling those off
type, and proving a sire by his progeny,
but these methods were revolutionary in
those days of eating the fat ones and- let-
ting the runts and roughies survive for
breeding. He was not actually a good
teacher. He said little, but he allowed
his pupils to find out for themselves all
they could about his work. His farm
was a good forum for the exchange of
ideas among stock-breeders, and Charles
Colling learned from a fellow-pupil,
Culley, the importance of “feel” in judg-
ing an animal. Bakewell had his best
success actually with sheep. His Leicesters
were used to improve nearly every other
breed of longwool.
* * * *
“B. A. Ker”: The little old place
standing well back from the road took
my mind back 14 years. There was a
small stack of bricks in the paddock that
day, and bricks gave promise of a job.
I found the owner building a long fowl
roost in one of the pens. “No,” he
snapped, ramming viciously at a post;
“I don’t want nobody to lay me bricks ;
I ain’t paralysed”... Suddenly his voice
rose to a heart-broken cry that was
something between a sob and a curse —a
young chicken, in diving to peck out a
worm in the hole, had .placed its neck
under the descending spud-bar. With
reverent hands the unintentional killer
picked up the pathetic little carcass.
“That’s the third in half an hour!” he
howled; and the mad look in his eye
gave me the impression that I was being
held responsible for the current tragedy.
“Why not let the rest out in the paddock
until you’ve finished the job?” I sug-
gested. For a long time the little old
bloke searched my face as though trying
to find the ulterior motive. Finally he
conceded: “H’m, it mightn’t be a bad
idea.” He was thawing out fast as I held
the posts for him to ram, when a flutter-
ing and squawking from the paddock
drew our attention. The marauding
fox-terrier had killed two chickens and
was just disappearing into the scrub with
the third when the horror-stricken owner
leapt to life. I don’t think the figures I
established for a short sprint, jump over
a post-and-rail fence and vault on to a
bike will ever be shattered. But that little
old bloke was wasting his time on a
poultry-farm—a man capable of heaving
a crowbar as far as that should have been
throwing a javelin in the Olympic Games.
* * * *
“Narrin”: Where pine-trees are in-
fected by aphis it’s a pretty safe bet you’ll
find a rather remarkable insect going its
carnivorous ways among the sucking
pests. At first it looks like a blob of
debris on the walkabout; a closer look
shows a longish insect with a formidable
pair of jaws something like those of the
ant-lion (to which it is distantly related)
and a heap of empty aphis “skins” stuck
on its back. It is the aphis-lion, larva
of the lacewing fly that hovers round the
lamp on warm nights, its golden eyes
like tiny jewels. The fly lays its eggs,
each on top of a vertical, hair-like stalk,
on a leaf—possibly so that the first to
hatch won’t clean up the rest., The larva’s
one idea in life is to eat as many aphis
as possible. Why it sticks the remains
of its victims on its back, however, is a
mystery; the aphis is so sedentary in its
habits that the attacker hardly needs
camouflage to creep up on it.
* * * \ *
“Bufo”: Ever since one of the can-
tankerous fowls assaulted Billy Hughes
when he was golfing—the shattered tree
blasted by the language of the veteran
statesman is still pointed out to awe-
stricken visitors —Canberra’s magpies
have been notorious for their aggressive-
ness during the nesting season. Effec-
tive self-protection is, of course, only a
matter of holding a small branch oyer
one’s head and refraining from waving
one’s arms about. But city-bred folk are
not aware of such matters, and assaults
on resident or visiting representatives of
foreign Powers might lead to inter-
national complications should Dr. Evatt
happen to be abroad at the time, as is
most likely. A curious feature of magpie
temperament is that maggies seem to be-
come far less aggressive in the more
northern Australian latitudes. In this s.-e.
Q. area they are plentiful, but I have
nfever seen or heard of an attack by them
even on schoolchildren, their chosen vic-
tims elsewhere.
* * * *
“Sur Cipgle”: The other day I was out
on foot in the ranges with the rifle. It was
hot and thirsty weather, and in my pocket
I carried an orange, a great treat that was
being saved until I got a real drought up.
After a long climb over bare, glaring rock
I reached the scrub at the top and picked
off a buck euro. Got to work with the
skinning knife and, before I realised it,
found myself more or less up to the
elbows in a mass of coiled-up round tape-
worms that lay in the tissues under the
hide. I don’t like worms but, being
curious, when I had peeled that marsu-
pial I opened up the body. The knife
slipped as I approached the liver, slitting
up the bile ducts and spilling out three
tapeworms, the biggest two of which were,
although contracted, four or five inches
long. That finished the investigation. I
sat down, in a bath of sweat and white-
hot sunlight, and had a smoke. Then, of
course, I remembered that treasured
orange. Now, if I’d been handling strych-
nine I’d have dusted off my paws and
peeled the fruit, but, after handling that
marsupial zoo, I wasn’t game. There may
or may not have been cause for fear, but
I climbed down off that range and walked
back three miles with a throat like a clay-
pan and a juicy orange in my pocket.
TALLY HO!
(In England, during a controversy over fox-hunting,
one devotee claimed that foxes would speak appreci-
atively of the sport.)
The day was new,
The pearly dew
Adorned each fertile blade.
The feathered throng
Burst into song:
It echoed down the glade.
With joyful heart
Fox scanned the chart.
Then turned to Mrs. Fox:
“My dear,” he said,
“Arise from bed
And brush your burnished locks. .
“This is the day
When humans play
And skittish foxhounds run.
It is our right
In joyful flight
To give the men their fun.
“See! Yonder hound
With nose on ground
Will soon pick up the scent.
He bays his find
To those behind:
I think it’s time we went.
“The hunt at last!
Ah! Not so fast,
We must not lose them yet.
Just lope along
Ahead the throng,
’Till closer we’re beset.
“The hounds are near;
’Tis time, my dear,
To deviate our course.
Yonder thicket
Is our ticket.
Yes! We could do much worse.
“Ah! My mistake.
This tiny brake
Will not afford much shelter.
But we’ll abide
Till horsemen ride
And hounds come helter-skelter.
“Now, off, my sweet,
With actions fleet;
The jolly hounds have found us.
Stop! Never mind!
Oh! Joyous find!
The dogs are all around us.
“The great delight
Of Reynard’s life
Is to have his throat torn out
’Mid eager yelps
Of pure-bred whelps
And the huntsmen’s lusty shout.
“I feel them tear
The outer hair:
It is ecstatic, really.
They have me caught
In jaws so taut,
The pleasing blood flows freely.
“See! Yonder bitch,
Forelips a-twitch,
Enjoys herself immensely.
So save your breath
And meet your death:
You’ll be amused intensely.”

THE MAN ON THE LAND
DONT WORRY. I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Classing.
“R. Ney”; Both my detractors (B.
9 /10/’46 and 16/10/’46) have jumped too
quickly to a conclusion over my state-
ment that *“a classer should make his
lines and class to them irrespective of
changes in flocks.” I hardly thought it
would be necessary to explain to anyone
in the game that that doesn’t mean mak-
ing lines on, say, wethers, and then
classing ewes, lambs, rams, goats and
even the cook’s Sunday-morning porridge
on the same basis.
Obviously a classer going to a shed
must have in his mind’s eye some idea of
how he will work. Many try to see the
sheep before they’re shorn as a pre-
liminary guide. Therefore, if his first
wool from the board is from good
wethers, then the classer will set his lines
for wether wool and stick to them for all
subsequent wether wool on that property.
If his first wethers come from red
country, with dusty backs and seeded
necks, and later on he gets wool from
wethers off clean country, what’s to stop
him stepping up a grade since the new
wool is better than that on which he be-
gan? He can neither step up a grade nor
down one if he is going to try to make
new lines for every variation in age, con-
dition, sex, height, weight, breed and
religious convictions of the sheep.
Similarly, when he gets his first ewe
wool in that shed he’ll set his ewe
standards and class to them as the rest
of the ewe wool comes to him. Again
he can go up or down according to the
rise or fall in the wool quality of dif-
ferent lots of ewes. And, with all due
respect to my critics, I doubt if there’s a
competent classer anywhere, whether it
be of wool or music, leather or oil paint-
ings, who doesn’t base his judgment on
such a system.
Feed the Ewes.
“Mr.”: Much inferior and broken and
tender wool arises from malnutrition.
Well-bred lines of crossbred ewes will
rear a lamb and .return 145.-worth of
wool in good seasons; but in poor
seasons a ewe not being supplementary-
fed is drawing on her reserves to rear a
lamb and will return much less wool.
Experiments reported in the S.A. “Jour-
nal of Agriculture” show that when ewes
were fed so as to gain 3914 b. during the
last 53 days of pregnancy, as compared
with ewes fed to. gain only lib. in the
same period, twin lambs were 47 p.c.
larger at birth and weighed 91b., as com-
pared with 6.11 b. Weight of single lambs
was not affected, the nutrients being sup-
plied by the ewe to her own detriment.
Apart from weight improvement of twin
lambs, the tests showed that extra feed-
ing greatly stimulated the milk flow, re-
sulting in faster growth of lambs imme-
diately after birth.
Spray Dipping.
“K.W.R.”: Avoid overcrowding in
dipping-pen. If pressure* is properly ad-
justed, with pump and pulley wheel of
the right size, about seven minutes
straight will suffice to wet all sheep carry-
ing up to two months’ growth, of wool.
Others will require longer.
Use of a gate-valve,on the delivery pipe
to the sprays will enable the dipping-pen
to be emptied and refilled with minimum
delay. Three minutes is the average time
lost here in penning-up, and at a pinch
one man without dogs can work the
whole concern.
Clean out the dip tank thoroughly after
each day’s usage and pump clean water
“Keep a close eye on it, Hennessy, and if it goes off give us a ring."
through the sprays. Life of the galvan-
ised-iron flooring in the dipping-pens will
be greatly prolonged by a yearly appli-
cation of coal-tar or roofing paint after
use, but if permanency is desired the
owner will be wise to build an iron-
walled dip on a sipping concrete floor.
The few extra pounds spent in initial
outlay will be well invested.
A Cold Brooder.
“Agro”: It’s for farms without electric
or lamp heaters. For, say, 100 chickens,
make your brooder sft. long by 2ft. wide
by Ift. high of lathes spaced |in. apart,
fixed on to studs of Sin. x 2in. on each
comer. Only the sides and one end are
closed, the top and bottom being open.
The one end is left open as a doorway.
Now make a cover frame which fits neatly
inside the other frame and cover it with
a tightly-drawn strip of bag. On one
face of the cover sew loose strips of bag
a few inches apart so that they hang
down. The chickens stand in between
these hanging strips and are thus kept
warm.
Up each corner stud of the first-men-
tioned frame drill holes about lin.
apart. A nail put through one hole on
each corner acts as a rest for the cover
frame, which can be lowered or raised
as desired. As the chickens grow bigger
the cover can be raised one hole occasion-
ally so that they are not cramped for
head room. The hanging strips on the
cover must barely reach the ground. If
they are too long the chickens are liable
to become entangled in them. The inside
corners of, the brooder should be rrfade
round with cardboard or other light
board to obviate chickens crushing each
other.
Set the brooder on a thick mat of straw,
which should be renewed every few days.
When the chickens have gone into the
brooder for the night, a bag should be
hung over the doorway. A few extra
bags*can also be placed over the top of
tjie brooder and let hang down over
the sides, taking care that the ventilation
spaces are not completely covered. After
a while the chickens will soon learn to
come outside for feed and drink, and to
return at nights. We found this method
quite satisfactory, having only a light
percentage of losses.
Ploughless Farming.
“Bumpkin”: “Bill C.” (B. 10/7/’46)
discounts my two small experiments in
ploughless farming on the grounds that
the results were due to irrigation and
that they would not have been possible
in his drought-stricken district, where he
has found that the shallower the soil the
quicker it, loses its moisture in a drought.
My district has a 24-inch rainfall, but
tomatoes could not be grown even there
without irrigation. The theory of
Faulkner, the American ploughless
farmer, applies particularly to the sort
of conditions “Bill C.” mentions. Faulk-
ner points out that every ton of organic
matter mixed into the surface of the soil
will be able to contain much more ab-
sorbed water than it could if buried at
plough depth. From his Ploughman’s
Folly :
Disking heavy green manure crops into
the surface of the soil is an excellent way
to create, precisely in the surface of the
soil, a reserve of water upon which crop
roots can draw continuously until it is
used up. Such an arrangement is obvi-
ously superior to the principle of permitting
the water to run down through the soil and
hoping it will be brought back by capil-
larity. Apart from holding a plentiful re-
serve of water in the root zone, the mass of
organic matter capillary water
continually from below, which replaces, at
least in part, the reserve from which
plants are drawing. This reserve supply of
water serves to tide crops over extended •
periods of drought which otherwise would
damage them seriously. From such a
source water can be made available during
many more days of the growing season\than
could possibly be the case when surface
conditions are such as to let some of the
rainfall run off and be wasted. Here is
“conservation of natural resources.”
Naturally, if the moisture completely
dries out nothing can be grown, but it is
difficult to see how ploughing can remedy
that situation, since ploughed-in organic
Matter, being weighed down by so much
overlying soil, has less volume than it
left on the surface, and therefore absorbs
less moisture.
Lespedezas.
“Bill C.”: In Queensland “Country
Life” John Ahern, a Maleny grazier,
described flespedeza (B. 24/4/’46) as “the
leguminous find of s.-e. Queensland.” It
was at Conondale, outside Maleny, and
Ahern said it appeared some 25 years ago,
now covers 150 square miles and is
spreading steadily. He is enthusiastic re-
garding its feeding qualities, and claims
that it grows well on poor soils and en-
riches them with nitrogen. A spring to
autumn grower and a free seeder, it
responds to super.
There are some pastures containing
lespedeza on the C.Q. coast, but the
C.S.I.R. warned me recently not to ex-
pect too much from it in this area. The
seed, however, is cheap when available,
and, considering the plant’s success at
Conondale, farmers in warm, wet districts
might well give it a trial.
Kalsomining.
“Dusty Gully”: Clean the wall surface
thoroughly with a stiff brushing and seal
with a coat of size. Joiner’s glue, soaked
in cold water tiff it jellies, then hot water
stirred in to thin the mixture, is the pre-
paration to use. When this has dried the
first coat of kalsomine may be applied.
Prepare the kalsomine by adding a
quarter-pound of joiners’ glue to the
packet, and soaking with a little more
cold water than is necessary to cover it.
Leave overnight, and next morning add
hot water, stirring continuously, till the
wash is the consistency of thin cream.
Use a good brush and coat the wall
evenly with up-and-down strokes. A
second coat, brushed on evenly, makes a
good smooth finish and it wilbnot rub off.
The Arab.
“E.H.S.”: There will always be a de-
mand for horses with the qualities of
spirit, strength, endurance and docility
exhibited by the Arab, and a fresh infu-
sion of th| blood would do much to im-
prove the** sadly deteriorated quality of
our saddle-horses.
The Arab exceeds 15 hands in height ;
is somewhat light in the barrel and his

The Sword Bean.
“Xob 33”: It’s an ideal summer bean
with vigorous growing habits ; a great
climber, one plant will cover an extensive
area and produce enough beans to keep
a small family going. It should run on
a trellis or netting fence.
The sword bean resists beanfly. Pods
form on extending friiit stems, something
like long beans, and, when matured are
likely to measure up to 16in, long and
2in. broad. Best time to plant seeds in
N.Q. is spring. Cropping will begin in 13
weeks and continue almost to the follow-
ing winter.
Pods for vegetable use should be picked
before the seeds develop or when they
are about Sin. long. At this stage the
beans are immature, but crisp and fat.
They should be sliced thinly and cooked
similar to French beans.
Hints for the Farm.
“W. Court”: When grasshoppers are
on the march, spread the arsenic-molasses-
bran bait in strips 30ft. wide in front
of them. Large numbers of young
’hoppers may be killed if a flamethrower
is turned on the stumps and logs where
they settle down about dusk. They
often camp for the night in patches of
long, dry grass, and great numbers will
be killed if fire is run round them on all
sides about sundown. Very little can be
done against the ’hoppers when they are
in the flying stage,
“Xob 33”: Towards Christmas we
usually preserve a few eggs for our own
use this way: Select fresh eggs and pack
them in the early morning. Rub each
egg with dripping (freshly-made) after it
has been tested for cracked shell. Get
an air-tight tin and some fresh bran.
Place bran and coated eggs evenly in the
tin, making sure that no egg touches
another. When tin is full secure the lid
tightly. Eggs can be kept this way for a
period of six months at least, and when
eventually used for cooking the yokes will
not break so readily as those preserved
in waterglass.
“Rooster”: Pea mite is a pest which
often does considerable damage before
being seen. About the size of a pin’s
head, quick of movement, and of
similar color to the ground, it is
difficult to detect.- Unless in plague
form the pest is most active during the
early morning and evening. In between
times it hides in the soil. At the first
sign of the insect dust with pea-mite
powder; contact or fumes are equally
effective, but dusting must continue while
any appear on the plants. Don’t have
any weedy strips along fences ; they’re

“Agro”: Simple disturbances can put
a fowl off laying. Cutting a bird’s wing-
feathers, disturbing it while on the nest,
or chasing it about can stop egg produc-
tion for a fortnight or more. Expect the
same result if a bird is locked in a crate
for some time, or is shifted during her
laying period. Try to make your birds
familiar with you by frequent visits to
their pen; they then will not fly up
nervously and disturb themselves when
you walk among them.
“Rhode Is.”: Milk is just as beneficial
to bird life as to humans, though this
is not widely known. Young chickens,
from a few days old, benefit from a
daily drink of milk. It should be left in
a vessel, as water is, and the chicks will
readily drink it with relish and profit.
No milk should be wasted where chicks
are, as even sour or thick milk is good
for them.
“Sarina”: Though anything is encour-
aged as a deterrent to stream erosion in
some coastal districts it’s a mistake to
tolerate lantana. It tends to spread across
narrow waterways, impeding the flow of
the water. In flood-time floating logs
and rubbish become jammed against the
straggling growth and sometimes cause
overflowing and consequent loss of sur-
face soil from adjacent cultivations.
Even when the water gets past the ob-
struction, the streambed is shallowed by
accumulated gravel and silt, and the way
is paved for overflowing at the next big
flood. Casuarinas (river oaks), bottle-
brushes, assorted ti-trees and figs (in
tropical parts) are among the best native
trees for preventing stream erosion. Use-
ful imported trees are tamarinds, willows
and bamboo (really a giant grass).
“Agro”: Fowls myst have dry feet for
the best laying results. They should be
kept under cover and given plenty of
dry straw to scratch in, A damp run
tends to prolong a moult. In cold
weather the birds need an extra heating
stimulant, such as beans, spices, etc., in
their food to shorten the moult.
“B”: The ordinary mouse-trap makes
an ideal paper clip for truck drivers or
others who find it necessary to carry and
refer to papers when driving. Remove
bait-plate and setting wire and nail the
trap to the dashboard or any most con-
venient place. The spring will hold
papers as well as any other contraption.
“W. Court”: Normally good soil that
is kept in decent shape by dressings of
compost or farmyard manure or by crops
of green manure needn’t be crammed
with artificial fertilisers before being sown
to a crop. To fertilise the drills only,
where the crop is being put in in rows
2ft.-3ft. apart, seems sufficient. Fertili-
sing the whole area means a lot of fer-
tiliser goes to waste in the inter-row
spaces. Fertiliser doesn’t feed the soil,
it feeds only the crop, so there’s no need
to scatter it where the crops’ roots aren’t
likely to find it.


Why Are
Dutch Ships
Still Banned?
This is an urgent and vital question because
on Ist January next (in less than three
months) all control of imports by the
Netherland Indies Government ceases.
Other countries are already on the spot
securing orders from the Dutch, Indo-
nesian and Chinese merchants but Australia
is “not in the race” because Communist
tactics within the waterside workers’ union
, have prevented any ships sailing with cargo
to the Netherlands Indies for nearly twelve
months.
If this continues Australia will be deprived
next year, as she was in 1946, of millions
of pounds worth of orders.
Every day lost now makes the task of re-
trieving Australia’s position more difficult.
The matter calls for urgent and immediate
action. The remedy is in the hands of the
trade unionists concerned. Export trade
will be a vital factor in providing full em-
ployment for our people in the future.

the Jews, which early in 1939 Hitler had
threatened would be one of the consequences
of an outbreak of war, and a special section
in the Gestapo under Adolf Eichmann was
formed to carry out the policy. Eichmann
has estimated that the policy resulted in the
killing of 6,000,000 Jews, of whom 4,000,000
were killed in the extermination institutions.
“With regard to crimes against humanity,
there is no doubt that political opponents were
murdered in Germany before the war, and
that many of them were kept in concentration
camps in circumstances of great horror and
cruelty. The policy of terror was earned out
on a vast scale, and in many cases was organised
and systematic. Revolting and horrible as
these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily
proved that they were done in execution of,
or in connection with, any such ..-crime. the
Tribunal therefore cannot make a general
declaration that the acts before 1939 were
crimes against humanity, but from the b'egin-
ing of the war in 1939 war crimes were com-
mitted on a vast scale, which were also crimes
against humanity; and in so far as the in-
humane acts charged in the indictment, and
committed after the beginning of the war, did
not constitute war crimes, they were all com-
mitted in execution of, or in connection with,
the aggressive war, and therefore constituted
crimes against humanity.
Guilty Organisations
“In effect, a member of an organisation
which the Tribunal has declared to be criminal
may be subsequently convicted of the crime
of membership and be punished for that crime
by death.
“The indictment has named the Leadership
Corps of the Nazi party as a group or organi-
sation which should be declared criminal, i tie
Leadership Corps consisted of the official or-
ganisation of fne Nazi party, with Hitler at
its head. The actual work of running the
Leadership Corps was carried out by the Chiet
of the Party Chancellery (Hess, succeeded by
Bormann). The Corps was used for purposes
which were criminal under the Charter and
involved the Germanization of incorporated
territory, the persecution of the Jews, the ad-
ministration of the slave labor* programme,
and the mistreatment of prisoners-of-war. The
defendants Bormann and Sauckel, who were
members of this organisation, were among those
who used it for these purposes. The Tribunal
declares to be criminal the group composed Ot
those members of the Leadership Corps who
became or remained members of the organisa-
tion with knowledge that if was being used for
the commission of acts declared criminal or
who were personally implicated as members of
the organisation in the commission of such
crimes. The basis of this finding is the par-
ticipation of the organisation in war crimes
and crimes against humanity connected with the
war. „ _ ,
“The Gestapo and S.D. and S.S. were used
for purposes which were criminal, involving the
persecution and extermination of the Jews,
brutalities and killings in concentration camps,
excesses in the administration of occupied terri-
tories, the administration of the slave labor
programme and the mistreatment and murder
of prisoners-of-war. The defendant Kalten-
brunner was among those who used the Gestapo
for these purposes.
Not Criminal
“Up until the purge beginning on June 30,
1934, the S.A. was a group composed in large
part of ruffians and bullies who participated in
the Nazi outrages of that period. It has not
been shown, however, that these atrocities were
part of a specific plan to wage aggressive war,
and the Tribunal therefore cannot hold that
these activities were criminal under the Charter.
After the purge the S.A. was reduced to the
status of a group of unimportant Nazi hangers-
on. Although in specific instances some units
of the S.A. were used for the commission of
war crimes and crimes against humanity, it
cannot be said that its members generally
participated in, or even knew of, the criminal
acts. For these reasons, the Tribunal does not
declare the S.A. to be a criminal organisation.
“The Tribunal is of opinion that no declara-
tion of criminality should be made with respect
to the Reich Cabinet. It is not shown that
after 1937 it ever really acted as a group or
organisation. From the time that it can be
said that a conspiracy to make aggressive war
existed the Reich Cabinet did not constitute
a governing body, but was merely an aggrega-
tion of administrative officers subject to the
absolute control of Hitler. Not a single meet-
ing of the Reich Cabinet was held after 1937.
The General Staff
“The Tribunal believes that no declaration
of criminality should be made with respect to
the General Staff and High Command. The
General Staff and High Command is neither
an ‘organisation’ nor a ‘group’ within the
meaning of those terms. According to the
evidence it consists of approximately 130
officers, living and dead, who at any time dur-
ing the period from February, 1938, when
Hitler reorganised the armed forces, to May,
1945, when Germany surrendered, held certain
positions, in the military hierarchy. The officers
were in a sense Hitler’s personal staff. In the
larger sense they co-ordinated and directed the
three services, with particular emphasis On the
functions of planning and operations. No
serious effort was made to assert that they
composed an ‘organisation.’ The assertion is
rather that they were a ‘group.’ The Tribunal
does not so find. According to the evidence,
their planning at staff level, their operational
technique in the field and at headquarters was
much the same as that of the armies, navies,
and air forces of all other countries. The
over-all effort at co-ordination and direction
could be matched by a similar form of organi-
sation in other military forces. To derive from
this pattern of their activities the existence of
an association or group does not logically fol-
low. On such a theory the top commanders of
every other nation are just such an association,
rather than what they actually are, an aggre-
gation of military men, a number of individuals
who happen at a given period of time to hold
the high-ranking military positions. The
Tribunal therefore does not declare the General
Staff and High Command to be a criminal
organisation. j
“But the Tribunal has heard much evidence
as to the participation of these officers in
planning and waging aggressive war and
m committing war crimes and crimes against
humanity. This evidence is, as to many of
them, clear and convincing. They have
been responsible in large measure for the
miseries and suffering that have fallen on
millions of men, women and children. They
have been a disgrace to the honorable profession
of arms. Without their military guidance the
aggressive ambitions of Hitler .and his fellow-
Nazis would have been academic and sterile.
Although they were not a group falling within
the words of the Charter, they were certainly
a ruthless military caste. Many of these men
have made a mockery of the soldier’s oalh of
obedience to military orders. When it suits
their defence they say they had to obey; when
confronted with Hitler’s brutal crimes, which
are shown to have been within their general
knowledge, they say they disobeyed. The truth
is they actively participated in all these crimes,
or sat silent and acquiescent, witnessing the
commission of crimes on a scale larger and
more shocking than the world has ever had
the misfortune to know.”

“Onions, buttercups to fight disease.”
— “Sun” heading.
Interviewed last night, the secretary of
the Onions’ Union (Mr. G. Weepers)
said: “We are tired of the Government’s
treading on our corms. Latest example
is its callous refusal to force growers to
provide adequate medical facilities, so
we intend taking matters into our own
sprouts. We have the funds, and our
first move will be the establishment of a
clinic, staffed by qualified personnel,
where our members can obtain free treat-
ment for ailments incurred as a result
of working long hours underground.
Already the Buttercups’ Federation is
interested in a similar scheme to combat
the menace of thrips, and we hope that
many more unions will follow our lead.
It’s time we showed the Government that
we are strong enough to stand on our
own roots.”
Delegates from several powerful
unions, including the Federated Root
Vegetables, Artichokes’ Union, Legumes
and Lentils Federation and the Amal-
gamated Vines and Trellis Workers, will
meet on Monday to discuss plans for a

the refusal of growers to grant a ten-

for an increase in night-shift overtime
rates also will be discussed.

Deep below the cheerless sky.

As man recoils if helping hands
Are changed abruptly into claws.

For thoughts to climb to Fancy’s goal,
And stars fling out a thousand arms
To tame the night and lure the soul.

While drowning in Insomnia’s vats,

To fling out at the squealing cats.

THE OTHER FELLW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
4Jd. per line; all others per line.
“Sensation”
The remarkable parallel between two
brutal assaults in N. S. Wales and similar
cases which happened a short while be-
fore in the U S.A. leads me to wonder
how far such occurrences are inspired by
newspaper accounts of kindred crimes.
Sadistic and perverted tendencies are
latent in many people who appear quite
normal. As long as they are not stimu-
lated, the impulses remain latent and may
even disappear. But when an unbalanced
mind receives the unhealthy stimulus
given by publicity of some sensational
crime, the impulse boils over and there’s
another sex horror for the headlines.
The alleged journalism of today shows
no restraint in the publication of details.
The facts are stated, generally in emo-
tional language, and the youth and beauty
of the victim are emphasised, with accom-
panying photographs if these can be got.
Where considerations of obscenity forbid
the disclosure of the worst details, these
are hinted at and made sufficiently plain
by inference.
Consideration for the feelings of the
victims and of their relatives and friends
might restrain ordinary decent people.
But any lapses into good taste or common
decency on the part of newspapers seem
to be overruled by the need for sen-
sation-mongering and for pandering to
the lowest common denominator of the
reading public with a “good story.”
The argument that publication of the
full details of outrages may act as a
warning to potential victims is not only
sheer bunkum but hypocrisy as well. To
the normal, sensible girl, no warning is
necessary other than what her parents
teach her. To the others, warnings are
futile. And if anyone imagines that the
motive behind any newspaper “sensa-
tion” is concern for the public good, he
has a touching faith in humanity which
should be dispelled before it leads him
into trouble.
Newspapers do enough damage with
the publication of salacious court reports
and pictures of photogenic brats with
next to nothing on. Ordinary people find
these interesting or disgusting, according
to taste. To the sexually immature or
unbalanced they must be at once a tor-
ment and a temptation. Following them
up with the morbid fascination of lavishly
detailed sexual outrage must amount to
lighting the fuse under the dynamite.
Freedom 6f the press is a phrase to
conjure with. But if newspapers can’t
use it with responsibility and good taste,
some rein should be enforced upon them.
—Jaques (N.S.W.).
Policeman’s Lot
In these days of demands for large
slices of the moon the requests of the
Queensland Police Union at its annual
conference are startling in their modera-
tion. They include heavier penalties for
assaults on the police and payment of
compensation for injuries received travel-
ling to or from work. This latter con-
cession would bring police into line with
other Queensland workers.
Considering a policeman’s multifarious
duties, ranging from minding lost children
and breaking bad news to relatives to
apprehending vicious criminals, the
general public is singularly unappreciative
of his efforts. Rarely, if ever, will the
public aid him in a brawl, even though
the odds be ten to one against him. This
latent hostility is quickly forgotten when
one of these gallant bystanders loses his
wallet or has his home burgled.
Few people seem to realise that a
policeman is simply enforcing our wishes
as interpreted by our elected representa-
tives. If the law is, in our opinion, un-
duly harsh on the wrongdoer, the
remedy lies in amending the law, not in
taking it out of the police.—C. H. (Q.).
Immigrants
Many years ago I was unloaded in
Sj'dney with a mixed, mob of about a
hundred others. We had been told in
England that we were coming to a land
where azure skies and the like were
eagerly waiting our. arrival. We were
assured of an official welcome, expert
advice, secure jobs and limitless oppor-
tunities.
For days we haunted the lobbies of
the Immigration Office looking for the
welcome, but got none except from a
few genial confidence men whose hospi-
tality left some of us wiser and poorer.
After three days of lobbying and an in-
terview lasting five minutes I was dis-
missed thus: “You look intelligent. I’m
quite sure you’re capable of finding your
own way about in this splendid country.
The best of luck!”
Then began my colonial experience in
many walks of life such as farming,
storekeeping, machine-minding, journal-
ism and literary coaching. In the years
between I have met some of my ship-
mates, and their stories tallied with
mine. In the absence of guidance they
had tried many jobs until they found a
groove that fitted them near enough.
We are expecting another invasion of
immigrants, not in hundreds, but in
thousands, with very varied skills and
ambitions. Will they be brushed off by
officialdom to find their own way in a
strange land or will they be guided to
tasks where their abilities will be most
profitable to the community and to them-
selves? Such guidance would require
preparation and forethought, but it
would prevent much confusion due to
trial and error and save manpower now
lost in whittling square pegs to fit round
holes.— Pom (S.A.).
Housing
Although I’m an ex-serviceman, I can
tell “V.A.M.” why civilians are entitled
to 50 per cent, of N. S. Wales Govern-
ment-built homes (B. 9/10/’46). Before
the war there was a housing shortage, and
during the war it became progressively
worse because bf building restrictions.
A civilian had no more opportunity of
“What'd y' like Fred to play for y' now—The Cow Cow Boogie'?"
*
acquiring or building new homes than a
serviceman. „
Apart from that, however, the people
most urgently in need of houses are those
with families (two or more children), and
these are the people whom the Housing
Commission is endeavoring to place. The
percentage of servicemen with large
families is relatively small compared with
civilians, and this same family responsi-
bility in many cases might have pre-
cluded the person concerned from enlist-
ing.
Lack of a house needn’t and doesn’t
prevent servicemen from marrying, and
at this stage they are more able to fend
for therriselves than a man with a family.
The 50-50 arrangement is more than fair.
“V.A.M.’s” second winge re the alleged
land-grabbing is not altogether un-
founded, But there are many instances
where the Commission has foregone re-
sumption in favor of a serviceman.
—H. H. P. (N.S.W.).
“A Model Tenant”
My friend Smithers bought a property
which he let through an agent
to an apparently satisfactory tenant
named Doolittle. Last month Smithers
drove past his investment and decided
to call in. Doolittle had been a model
tenant during his six years’ occupancy,
never requesting repairs or renewals, and
Smithers felt he would like to meet the
man.
He strode to the front door, noting
that the garden could have looked worse
or a great deal better. A harrassed-
looking woman answered his knock. “Is
Mr. Doolittle at home?” Smithers asked.
The woman looked amazed. “He doesn’t
live here,” she said. “He only comes
here to collect the rent from all of us.”
Further inquiry revealed that for six
years the house had been let to three
families, Doolittle in turn sending a
cheque to the agent. Tackled with his
complicity, the agent admitted that he
had within a few months discovered that
the house had 6een sub-let. Inquiries
to the Fair Rents Board proved that
Doolittle’s position was unassailable. In
fact, the agent learned, Doolittle had
three other properties which he sub-let
in the same manner.
Doolittle has lived for six years with-
out working, letting the other fellow’s
capital provide him with an income.—

The Price of Ignorance
According to Queensland’s Valuer-
General, large areas of the State’s
richest agricultural land have, during the
last 40 years, been rendered unproductive
by overstocking, unnecessary clearing of
natural vegetation and failure to restore
essential soil ingredients, all of them
root-causes of erosion. On the Darling
Downs thousands of acres of what were
20 years ago gently undulating farming
slopes are now scored through with deep
gullies 50 to 100 yards wide and
abandoned. In the Kingaroy district
over 43 per cent, of all cultivated slopes
are suffering from erosion. On the tropi-
cal Atherton Tablelands erosion has
caused serious diminution of maize out-
put notwithstanding substantial increase
in total cultivated area.
Queensland’s Lands Minister Jones has
warned graziers in the drought-stricken
south-west that the growing practice of
using bulldozers and other machinery to
tear up or knock down mulga scrub for
sheep feed will create dust-bowl condi-
tions very soon and ruin large areas of
pastoral country for all time. He even
intimated that his Government “may”
take action to prevent further destruc-
tion. The Selectors’ Association has re-
plied that the lack of labor, especially
reliable labor, for hand-cutting renders
mechanical help the only alternative to
total loss of flocks.
Now the Commonwealth Bureau of
Statistics reveals that for 1944-45 the
number of sheep in Australia was the
lowest since 1924. Dairy cattle had de-
clined by 209,000 and beef cattle by
51,000. A decline of 90,000 horses was
also recorded, and the remaining
1,265,000 was equal to only half of the
peak record in 1918. These ominous
figures will certainly be increased sub-
stantially when the continued drought
period of 1945-46 comes to be reckoned
up in terms of stock losses.
Yet, with all these disturbing facts in
plain view, not one of our six mainland
“Governments” is taking any real action
towards averting, or even delaying, the
national disaster which must result from
unchecked erosion and soil starvation.
The consequences of similar ignorance
and neglect have recently startled the
United States Government into vast and
highly-organised activities for preventing
further extension and attempting eventual
restoratipn of fertility over millions of
man-ruined acres. A similar practical
awakening has taken place in Canada.
While dry weather lasts the parched
impoverished soil will continue to be
carried off in countless tons by winds.
When the rains eventually come they will
carve out yet more arid gullies and silt
up yet more watercourses. With the con-
tinuing help of unthinking Australian
mankind every future period of drought
will mean another step towards aridity of
the small area of this continent which
can be regarded as good or even fair
agricultural or pastoral land. From the
viewpoint of professional politics the
matter is relatively unimportant as com-
pared with, say, “sport” or keeping the
unions quiet. But from the viewpoint of
a nation it is a matter of choice between
life and death within another century at
most. — Notaden (Q.).
Solidarity
During the recent elections I suspected
Adelaide trade-unions of socialistic lean-
ings. This morning I witnessed their
splendid Eight-Hour Day procession, and
it proved to be a whole-hearted boost
for big business and private enterprise.
Working exhibits were conspicuous by
their absence, but there was a magnificent
display of vehicles advertising the pro-
ducts of the big shots of the master class.
I was particularly impressed by a long
line of butchers’, bakers’ and milk-de-
livery turnouts. Each unit was fit for the
show-ring. The drivers, as always in their
profession, were the jolliest of fellows and
their ponies were in the pink. A suitable
banner for this section could have borne
the device “Big business is • good for
man and beast.” A loudspeaker on one
float blared something about a 40-hour
week, but that was only incidental.
The overall effect was that of a huge
publicity stunt for various lines of heavy
goods and for certain brands of bread,
milk, ice-cream, with beer, of course, as
a grand finale. Not a brawny was
bared, not a pair of shirt-sleeves rampant
was visible in the entire spectacle.—N. O.
(S.A.).
“Brown Brother”
“Don 5” (B. 4/9/’46) may have a
soldier’s reaction, but he disproves his own
contention. Unintentionally the Army
did “spoil” a proportion of the natives.
It taught them that things, generally, were
easier than they had believed. Army life
was almost as communal as village life;
the native was as well fed and cared for,
and his daily effort was not confined to
set working hours. His efforts seemed
to have no bearing on the earning of
what he received.
The average Papuan has no idea that
his wages must be earned before they
can be paid. He thinks that the white
man has “plenty, moni” which is just
being handed out for his benefit. That
was his attitude in pre-war days, so it’s
easy to see how Army life augmented
that philosophy. That outlook in the
natives is nothing very discreditable, but
it surely shows the long road ahead if he
is to be taught that something for no-
thing cannot continue. That’s the
planters’ nightmare.
There never has been forced labor
here, and certainly there’s no poverty or
“low standards.” The average Fuzzy’s
wants are very few. They will increase
as time goes on and he will be taught,
by experience only, that the satisfying of
those wants depends on himself, even
though taxpayers will, within limits, help
to that end. “Boong-bashers”? Did
“Don 5” ever read our pre-war Native
Labor Regulations?—Me Ale (Papua).
“Production Operatives ’
“P. I. Cony” (B. 4/9/’46) points out
that the high wages paid to Maoriland
women in the “genteel” occupations deter
them from offering as factory or hospital
hands. Comparative wages are not the
sole cause ; the word “genteel” is a clue
to a more cogent factor.
Recently in Westralia it was announced
that the proprietors of a factory would
abandon the term “factory hand” in
favor of “production operative.” This,
it was confidently claimed, would give
girls the same social standing as
typists—or should I say stenographers?
Occupational-name snobbery has de-
veloped so rapidly in recent years that it
has become an industrial and social
menace. It has already led to the virtual
disappearance of the household servant
—pardon, “domestic.”
There is no doubt that the domestic
servant is financially better off than the
female office-worker. She gets her board
and lodging, has no fares to pay and
wear and tear on her clothes is a bagatelle
when provided with a uniform. She can
learn household economy, the care of
children and much about the behavior
of = a wide variety of people, thus receiv-
ing invaluable training in the art of being
a wife and mother.
The office-worker has none of these
advantages, yet she turns up her nose
at domestic work for wages. It is “so
degrading”! — Screwball (W.A.)
The Territory
Isn’t it about time this for
closer-settlement in N.T. was dropped?
The cattle industry is never one for the
small man unless he is prepared to rough
it all his life. The small mining shows
are so located that only the stouthearted
will face the life, and the big- shows call
for big capital.
Agriculture is possible on acres only.
The Army farms during the war did not
total 1000 acres, and the market was on
the spot. It is not so now, and transport
charges to southern markets would be
prohibitive. — John H. (Vic.).


“The Overlanders”
I saw it yesterday and am going to see
it again this afternoon, because I think
it is one of the finest films I have ever
seen.
I should like Australians to know how
much we, in England, appreciate all they
have done and are still doing for us. A
film like that makes one realise the
amount of toil and sweat that goes to
produce the food we eat.
I wish we could see more films about
Australia and Australians. — Paula Wait
(London).
The Bulletin’s review of “The Over-
landers” was very good. Chips Rafferty
and company would have been trampled
to death if they had got in front of those
thirsty cattle.
And those three or four head
that tumbled over the mountain! There
would have been hundreds of them at
the bottom in a jam such as that one.
They would have drawn up to the leaders
until they had no room to stand ; then
they would have taken fright and tried
to ring (a thing cattle always do in a
tight corner) and most of them would
have gone overboard.
Then, when those horses died, some-
one spotted a mob of brumbies. He
raced back and reported to Chips ; and
away they went to collar the brums. I
know this much about brumbies —if you
can get close enough to them you are far
too close to leave them and expect to find
them waiting for you later on.
' I can’t help thinking of the laugh that
men like Burt and Dick Tucker, Charlie
Parker, Harry Barker, Bundoo Mc-
Crackan, Billy Page, Bert and Billie Cott,
Chilla Wyatt, Matt Roberts, Billy Heinz
and scores of others—all big-gun drovers
—will have when they see the film.—
Rickety Dick (N.S.W.).
The old Army term “getting it easy”
could well be applied to reviewers of
books, paintings, films and so on. These
people are paid to write their own
opinions, which, however honest and
capable, can only strike sympathy with
a small section of the varied opinion
which goes to make public thought. This
is vividly demonstrated by the fact that
critics rarely agree among themselves —•
how then is the private individual to be
guided?
Reviewed in four journals, “The Over-
landers” receives praise varying from
lukewarm to enthusiastic, though ad-
mittedly the desire to give an Australian
production a good start influences all.
The British film “Henry V” was slated
by some critics and praised by others —
personally I thought it the best picture
England has given us. A book of short
stories by an Australian author earned
sharply contrasting criticisms from three
leading journals. And so it goes on,
proving that space allotted to review-
ing is wasted.
One can only judge the worth of a
poem, story, painting or film for oneself,
according to one’s own. outlook, approach
and level of intelligence.— Bondi Beach-
comber (N.S.W.).
Blood Money
The notorious Burma-Thailand rail-
way, built with p.-0.-w. labor, has been
sold for £100,500, a nice little windfall
for any Treasury. It would be only just
if at least a portion of these spoils of
war were distributed among surviving
p.-0.-w. who suffered so greatly and, in
many cases, still show ill effects from that
gruelling.
The military authorities refused pay-
ment of three shillings a day subsistence
to these ex-captives on the grounds that
they had been fed by the detaining Power.
Contradiction lies in all too many piti-
ful little wooden crosses marking the
resting-places of the tired ones who could
not make the grade. Almost half the
total number engaged as slaves by
Nippon in its mad enterprise died —it is
said a life was paid for every rail laid.
—Deloraine (Q.).
G. B. Shaw and War Criminals
In the world of art and literature there
seems to be a rule that any man who
once achieves fame can perpetrate any
absurdity and still retain his laurels.
Shaw’s maunderings about the Nuremberg
trials are a case in point. He says that
because the Nazi leaders, stripped of their
uniforms, are commonplace mortals they
should have been set free and punished
only with silent contempt. He does not
actually say that we should turn the
other cheek to the smiters, but he would
certainly have given them a sporting
chance to have another smack at us
from behind.
Shaw ignores the fact that defenceless
freedom for the culprits would mean their
elimination by a world of commonplace-
looking enemies if they did not eliminate
each other. In either case the absence of
distinction in their features or demeanor
would not be considered. The survivors
of their sadism care for none of these
things, and the guilty men themselves
have never considered the shape of the
heads they bashed—except that they pre-
ferred Semitic features to batter.
Shaw seems to think of the Beast of
Belsen as a naughty boy, who, armed with
a big stick while in charge of a basket of
eggs, was tempted to make a big splash.
“How oft the power to do ill deeds makes
ill deeds done.” The logical moral is not
to treat the boy with silent contempt, but
to make sure that the incident does not
recur.
The true lesson, clear to the most illiter-
ate mind, is that never again should any
man, good or bad, handsome or ugly, be
given unlimited power over his fellow-
men of any race, religion, or political
color— Pshaw (S.A.),
Age and Politics
Without disrespect to the Right Honor-
able and rightly honored member for
North Sydney, I suggest that his re-elec-
tion accentuates the necessity for an over-
haul of electoral legislation. A candidate
must be at least 21 years old, but, once
elected, he may be returned indefinitely
provided the voting public, whether from
party affiliations, sentimental reasons or
sheer force of habit, continues to support
him at the polls.
In addition to one octogenarian, several
candidates returned in September were
over 70. Until quite recently an important
portfolio was held by an 80-year-old
Senator, still Vice-president of the Execu-
tive Council. Public servants, on the
other hand, in common with most em-
ployees of private enterprises, are com-
pulsorily retired at 65, whilst heads of
the armed forces are generally placed on
half-pay much earlier.
Few of us can expect to retain,
in our seventies and after, the un-
impaired physical and mental faculties
needed to serve the electorates and the
nation. Keeping pace with the changing
responsibilities of this age and the hurly-
burly of modern Parliamentary life is a
strain even on younger and tougher men.
— T. Raymond (Ashfield, N.S.W.).
The Birthrate
The argument that economic insecurity
and housing shortages are factors in Aus-
tralia’s low birthrate (B. 11/9/’46) is
exploded by the facts. Economic security
is greater today than 50 years ago when
the reproduction rate was much higher.
There is greater comfort and a higher
expectation of life today than there was
in 1901, when the birthrate was 27.2.
Our birthrate has been declining steadily
since 1911, and the rate reached its lowest
level in 1934, when the birthrate was
16.4. An improvement began in 1939,
when figures rose gradually to 20.7 in
1943. The rise is due to increased mar-
riages after the depression and during the
war years. Lack of housipg during the
war has failed to prevent a big war-time
increase in marriages and a correspond-
ing rise in the birthrate —which, how-
ever, is still sufficient for replacement
only.
There are other and more obvious
causes for the decline in the birthrate.
The extraordinary fact is that in all coun-
tries where there is political and economic
freedom, where children have every
opportunity of faring better in life than
their parents, there is a limitation of
families. The same downward trend is
apparent wherever white civilisation has
made contact. In all primitive coun-
tries the birthrate is high, as in China,
where affection of parents for their
children and veneration of children for
their parents form the very foundations
of national culture. —C. L, (Vic.).
Lamb, Mutton and Beef
Because of drought and of abattoir,
wharf and shipping strikes, our exports of
lamb and mutton to Britain in 1945 were
only 2,373,267 carcasses, though 7,310,852
were shipped during the best export
period of the war.
Since 1942 Australian sheep numbers
have fallen by 20,000,000, American by
8,790,000 and British by 6,834,000. The
decline in sheep population in Europe
has been heavier. Meat supplies are un-
likely to fulfil demand for some years
ahead.
British contract prices should ensure
profitable returns to September, 1948, but
in recent months local demand has been
such that operators at Homebush and
Flemington have had to go above British
contract rates.
Cattle figures at 14,133,154, of which
Queensland pastures 54 per cent., are
1,285,536 higher than in 1939. But our
exports last year were only 513,034
quarters compared with 1,500,000 in
pre-war years. Lack of rail trucks added
to the difficulties of drought and strikes,
and the U.S. forces stationed in Australia
increased local demaqd. The N. S. Wales
railway spokesman reports that no new
trucks will be available till 1947.
Local demand has exceeded the export
prices of 50s. per 100-pound yearling
beef, 455. light steers and 425. *heavy
steers. Effects of the Queensland meat-
workers’ strike have been serious for
graziers and the British consumer.
Growers who have been involved in
heavy losses by strikes are now agitating
for compensation from Governments
who fail to maintain law and order, —
Graz (N.S.W.).
High Taxation
I thought I had read something about
it before. J. H. Breasted in his Ancient
Times gives the following reasons for the
decline of the Roman Empire. Oppres-
sive taxation;
The financial burden of this vast organi-
sation... .was enormous. For this multi-
tude of Government officials had to be paid
and supported. The amount of a citizen’s
taxes therefore continued to increase, and
finally little that he possessed was free
from taxation. Staggering under his crush-
ing burden of taxes the citizen of every
class had now become a mere cog in the
vast machinery of the Government. He
had no other function than to toil for the
State, which exacted so much of the fruit
of his labor that he was fortunate if it
proved barely possible for him to survive
on what was left.
And on the decline of initiative:
Finding the burden of taxation unbear-
able, most of the small farmers gave up
the struggle. Without any prospect of
bettering themselves or any opportunity for
their children to possess their own lands,
these men lost all energy and independence.
Multitudes turned to the city for relief.
Debased by city life, the former sturdy
yeoman lost his independence in an eager
scramble for a place in the waiting line
of the city poor. The time that should
have been spent in breadwinning was worse
than wasted at the chariot races, bloody
games and barbarous spectacles.
Will our rulers learn, or will another
fine country be ruined by discouraging
initiative and by excessive taxation? —
Rehmstedt (S.A.),
Duntroon
“Army authorities” are, I read, “dis-
appointed with the small number of appli-
cants for Duntroon.” No wonder.
No indication has been given as to pay
and conditions for officers on graduation.
The pre-war £5 a week, from which a
man provided living expenses, uniform,
etc., is not a tempting bait. The records
of many graduates in two World Wars
proves the excellent standard of training
attained despite the meagre pay. In a
small permanent force such as Australia
maintains in peace, few graduates can rise
to high rank or a commensurate salary.
Uncertainty of ‘ tenure and of what
strength and composition the armed forces
will be maintained is worrying to the
individual and harmful to the Service.
The average professional or business-
man who is industrious and makes few
major mistakes can look forward to a
competence in his mature years. Not so
the professional soldier, who is retired in
his prime— at an age when it is extremely
difficult for him to embark on a new
venture with certainty of success.
Though the professional standard in the
Services is high, the nature of his studies
and experiences does not fit him for com-
parable civilian employment at a time
when the education of his children is
costly and at the peak.
To some extent this can be remedied
by ensuring that graduates of Duntroon
qualify in another profession before or
during their college training ; but even
so the pre-war rates of pay will need to
be doubled to attract the best types of
students. — Three Wars (N.S.W.).
Underground Gasification
Underground gasification of coal (B.
28/8/’46) has its points, the chief being
the reduced need for coalminers, but there
are too many drawbacks.
In Russia, where underground gasifica-
tion has been developed to some extent,
the gas is of low calorific value and suit-
able only for industrial purposes. En-
richment to a value suitable for domestic
use would require normal gasification of
large quantities of coal or the use of oil,
which would have to be imported.
A further drawback is that underground
gasification means production on the coal-
field. Unless the field is close to centres
of population, the cost of distribution to
towns and cities of low-grade gas would
be high.
Finally, although gas is used exten-
sively in every coal-bearing country and
labor troubles in coalmining are common
to all of them, no, serious attempts —out-
side Russia —have been made to develop
underground gasification. Wusslean
(Vic.).
Book Reprints
There is a new scope for enterprising
Australian publishers in the unprece-
dented demand for all types of reading
material. The high cost of good books
has had an inimical effect upon our
literary sales and standards, for the simple
reason that the majority of people will
not pay 10s. or 15s. for a novel when up-
wards of a dozen attractive magazines
may be bought for the same amount.
In the U.S.A. the pocket-book series,
published by various houses and with an
extensive range of titles, has an increas-
"Not so fast. Dad — I cant find Come-by-Chance here!”
ingly wide circulation. Distributed at a
popular price of about Is. 6d., these books
are mostly reprints—detective, mystery,
romance, western, adventure and non-
fiction.
In this country reprint books of the
“Pocket Library” type published last year
by the Commonwealth Literary Fund
should have a wide appeal, but the shoddy
appearance of Australian productions
must be eliminated. The use of good-
quality paper, with type large enough for
fast reading, and attractively illustrated
covers, would do much to promote sales.
To ensure lasting appeal, books should
appear with laminated covers, which look
fresh and keep the volume in first-class
Condition.
Payment to authors for reprint rights
would be at standard rates —a guaranteed
minimum against royalties depending on
former sales of the book in its original
edition. If the author were popular, an
initial advance of from £5O to £lOO would
not be excessive.
Attractively printed, and sold at com-
petitive prices, there is no reason why
pocket editions of outstanding books
should not be distributed overseas. If the
American acceptance of Capricornia is a
true indication, there are lucrative
markets available, with no restrictions on
theme. In the U.S.A. the first title to
pass the million mark was Dale Carnegie’s
How to Win Friends and Influence
People, while the 25th million-sale title
for the same publishing company was a
collection of poetry.
Although good novels would command
highest sales, short stories of merit could
also be used, alternating an anthology
one month with a collection by a single
author the next month. The occasional
appearance of a few original MSS. in
topical fields would lend variation.
With writers like Xavier Herbert,
William Hatfield, Brian James, Frank
Dalby Davison, Vance Palmer and many
others, there is no reason why the regular
production of Australian pocket-books
should not prove very profitable to
authors, publishers and the reading public.

Have YOU
sufficient
LIFE ASSURANCE?
No man should so overload himself with
assurance that the payment of premiums
may become an embarrassment during his
lifetime.
On the other hand, no man —at least no
man with a dependent family—can afford
to sit back complacently with too little life
assurance. Indeed, the amount of life
assurance that you should have is of
utmost importance. It is YOUR responsi-
bility to see that the total of your policies
will be sufficient to afford your family the
protection that they will need, should the
emergency arise.
Now is the time to make provision for the
future. Not necessarily protection against
the possibility of death only, but provision
for all manner of purposes; the home you
intend to build; education for your family;
financial ‘independence in your old age.
You can provide for these things with Life
Assurance. . .Whole of Life Assurance
payable at death, and Endowment Assur-
ance payable at a determined, date or at
previous death.
Examine your situation now, and decide
how much assurance of both forms you
should have!
A City Mutual Service
City Mutual will welcome the opportunity
of assisting you in your assurance prob-
lems. Our officers will explain the advan-
tages of both types ; will tell you what
premiums are payable, and show you
what you gain with City Mutual Policies.
Remember, when you assure with City
Mutual you assure with an old-established,
