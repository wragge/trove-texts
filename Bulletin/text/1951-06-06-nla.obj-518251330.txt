SPIRITUAL HOME OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE GARTER, ST. GEORGE’S CHAPEL
IN the Lower Ward of Windsor Castle is the magnificent St. George’s Chapel,
one of the finest examples in Britain of the late medieval style of architec-
ture known as Perpendicular. The Chapel was originally planned by King
Edward IV (1461-1483), not only as a Royal Chapel but also as the temple
of the Knights of the Garter, that ancient order of chivalry founded in 1348
by King Edward 111. . , , , . ,
The first stage of building was completed in 1483, when the choir ana
aisles were finished, and this was followed by the building of the nave, which
was roofed in 1496, although the superb stone vaulting was not completed
until 1528. Extensive restoration was carried out between 1921 and 1930, and
today the Chapel appears very much as it did four centuries ago during the
reign of Henry VIII. Its outward appearance is remarkable for its detail and
symmetry; around the parapet are a number of grotesque gargoyles, and each
square pinnacle is surmounted by the stone figure of a heraldic animal or
“King’s beast.” . .
The chief architectural feature within the Chapel is the delicate stone-
vaulted roof, with its numerous colored shields and heraldic devices, including
the famous blue Garter. The main body of the choir is tilled with elaborately
carved stalls, which were completed in 1485. The upper tier is for the Knights
of the Garter, and above the stall of each knight hangs his banner and coat
of arms- on the canopy of each stall is a helmet surmounted by the knights
crest Beneath the royal standard is the Sovereign’s Stall, with that of the
UC Although most of the carved woodwork of the stalls tell the Gospel story,
or the leaend of St. George, there are others that are satirical. One of these
depicts a B monkey, intended to be a doctor, pouring medicine down the throat
of P a lean dog lying on its back; another shows a cat on a stool playing the

1483) Henry VIII (d. 1509), his third queen, Jane Seymour, and Charles I
(d 1649). Here also may be seen the more recent tombs ot Edward VII (d.
1910), Queen Alexandra and that of King George V.

McCARE IN HEAVEN.
The astonishing thing about Hugh
McCrae’s The Ship of Heaven (Angus
and Robertson), seeing that the poet —
characteristically-—completely forgot what
his plot was about after the end of the
first Act, is how near it comes to success
as a comedy in verse and even as a
popular piece for the stage.
A critic who saw the original produc-
tion by Doris Fitton (with Alfred Hill’s
music) in Sydney in 1933 informs the
present writer that the audience found it
difficult to laugh at some of McCrae’s
fantastic humor —the animated puns, for
instance, when Sir Gorgeous Gobble,
examining his enormous wristlet watch,
says “Time hangs so heavy on my hands”
or when Pierrot, dining in the garden,
calls for the bill and a hillygoat comes
in—and it may well he that jokes like
this, delightful as they are to read, are
too rarefied and elaborate to win more
than a passing smile on the stage. And
possibly even a ship’s captain reading a
book through his telescope or a milk-can
hooked onto a ship’s side for the milkman
to call belong to literature rather than the
theatre.
Yet a play where a box in which a
negro slave is concealed chases the char-
acters around, and a hangman begs for
entrance to the ship of heaven, and Mary
Hadda [little lamb] is admitted on board,
and angels try to snare Cupid like a bird,
and patients are chopped up in a doctor’s
shop, and stained-glass windows walk
about like living saints, and flowers,
sprinkled by a watering-can held out by
a hand from behind the moon, come to
life and dance, and Pierrot, in some of>
McCrae’s most glorious lyrics, laments
the cruelties of Columbine —a play so
full of poetry and comedy and imagina-
tion would at least be a rare and enchant-
ing spectacle on the stage.
And the book, whether for reading or
for performance, is curiously timely.
Surrealism is not new on the stage, for
there was “The Tempest” ; a gay inconse-
quence is not new, for there was “A Mid-
summer Night’s Dream” ; but surrealism
and poetic gaiety have lately become
fashionable again ; and just as audiences
which have enjoyed the lightheartedness
of Christopher Fry’s “Venus Observed”
should be able to enjoy Sir Gorgeous
Gobble singing:
Then let the girls grow old apace
And wander into heaven ...
I’ll love a twenty-summer’s face
When I am ninety-seven!
so should audiences which have accepted
Saroyan, Wilder, and Strindberg’s surreal-
ist “Dream Play” not be unduly sur-
prised by a play in which the author
magnificently instructs his doctor to “ad
lib” and then explains that this is the
sort of “ad libbing” he expects:
For instance, he takes a melancholy
man’s brain out of his head and, having
first carefully wiped it all over with a
sponge, paints it with a glittering mixture
and puts it back again. He locks the skull
with a key. Man goes out ( R.U.E .) in fits
of suppressed laughter. DOCTOR makes
an old woman yotmg One of the
patients (A dummy, assisted across the
floor by the BOY) the DOCTOR chops up
altogether, throwing a leg or an arm at a
time into a basket fitted at the end of his
table. As he losses away the head all the
remaining patients (except PIERROT) fly
from the house.
The wildest nonsense is, after all, a
criticism of sense. And it is even pos-
sible, too, to perceive a contest of emo-
tions, therefore a kind of plot, underlying
all this apparently disconnected sur-
realism ; for the doctor’s-shop scene, even
though a roar of McCrae’s wild laughter
accompanies the stage-directions, is really
ferociously macabre; and the garden-
scene, too, when the flowers present their
bills to Pierrot (for the use of their scent)
has something more than light laughter
in it —think about it long enough and it
becomes a nightmare. So you have, if
not a connected plot about the ship of
heaven, an emotional drama in which
youth and song and love and laughter
dance over the abyss of death and night-
mare . . . and finally, somehow, triumph.
But, precisely because it is too inconse-
quential, “Venus Observed” is not
Christopher Fry at his best; and if one
thinks that The Ship of Heaven is not
less profound as a surrealist play than
Auden’s “The Ascent of F6”—it is
simply much more pleasant—that still
does not make it a good or a finally
effective piece of dramatic construction.
It is, indeed, amazingly disjointed.
Originally McCrae must have meant to
write some sort of comedy about “the
ship of heaven” ; it was to be moored at
the back of the stage and the good people
were to be allowed to board it for heaven*
and the bad people were to stay on earth
. . . and, if one knows McCrae, have a
very good time of it. Perhaps they were
to create their own heaven on earth;
perhaps they were to climb to a different
heaven on another ship; perhaps, at the
last minute, they were to be chosen for
the voyage after all, and to sail off and
leave the good people lamenting. At any
rate, with Columbine pleading to be
allowed on the ship, and all sorts of good
people and bad people being drafted as
happy sheep and sad or indignant goats,
there was to be some kind of connected
drama.
Well, the ship of heaven is moored to
the stage all right; and at the end of
the first Act it soars aloft to heaven ;
and the plot soars with it, and is never
seen again . . . It is true that Columbine,
who has set off after the ship in an aero-
plane with Sir Gorgeous Gobble, an inter-
loper from the reign of Queen Anne,
returns to earth for Act 3 ; but what
she has seen of heaven, "or the ship of
heaven, or what real connection this
somewhat absurd adventure has with the
heavenly plot, must remain for ever a
mystery.
Dimly, and entirely unrelated to the
ship-of-heaven idea, there is still the
traditional plot of Columbine torturing
Pierrot with jealousy and finally relenting ;
but chiefly there remains, to hold the
attention of an audience for two Acts,
absolutely nothing . . . except a set of
spirited divertissements; sometimes, as
when Sir Gorgeous Gobble and the rest
are trying to catch his aeroplane, which
has been stolen by Cupid, rather forced
in humor; but more often brilliant—-in
the songs, in the doctor’s-rshop, and in the
garden scenes of moonshine and night-
mare : —
TREE.
Not a yard shall you stir, sir, until you
have paid
The thirty-six shillings you owe me for
shade.
FLOWERS.
[Rather diffidently shewing bills.]
Sir, or madam (which ever), we beg to
present
Accounts to be settled re purchase of scent.
THE MOON.
A cheque will oblige (if we can’t have it
soon
We’ll turn off the meter). Yours truly,
the Moon.
PA III.
For being much trod upon, right down the
middle,
Our fee is one guinea . . .
Ultimately, then, it is as a set of
divertissements that one must accept The
Ship of Heaven —an enchanted and irre-
sponsible garden where fountains in the
moonlight, fed by genius, flow intermit-
tently with light laughter or a melody as
deep and beautiful as anything in English
lyric poetry: —■
Music of cherubim, with kind
Cool climbing flute-notes ovei twined
Grave harps a-row. Long lulling words
Of water interchanged with birds:
Then sweetest slumber take me where
She walks the chambers of the air.
The book, now printed in full for the
first time, has McCrae’s own illustra-
tions and, bound in a maroon buckram,
is an exceptionally fine piece of publish-
ing craftsmanship throughout.

The History of Mr . Wells.
On the very few occasions he has-been
homing at two in the morning, the
reviewer has felt tempted to pull up on
seeing an empty phone-booth and disturb
some friend’s slumbers with a ring loud
and long; but he’s never done so. One
who had fewer scruples was the dumpy
little irascible person, high-priest of the
Rational World Order, central character
of H. G. Weils (Longman’s), by Vincent
Brome, whose whim it was to ring a
‘ friend at 2 a.m. and pop some such
question as, “What’s the opposite of
peroration?”
Wells had other quirks and caprices.
One was the deliberate choice, so as to
defy the gods of superstition, of a house
because it was No. 13 ; in the blitz, after
a bomb had fallen near the house, he
had immediately put up a huge No. 13
beside the front-door. (He was to die,
however, on August 13, 1946.) Another
fancy of his was to engage in rowdy
amusements in and round his house; he
often played “outrageous” games with
mobs of children, the “children” very
often being no less personages than
Bernard Shaw, Bertrand Russell, Chester-
ton.
Wells was born in 1866, with few
advantages. We see him growing up ill-
fed and badly clothed, put to the drapery
trade (which he hated),- changing to a
teaching job as a student master (at £20
a year), reading widely and studying,
marrying his cousin, deserting her for
another, his life a continual struggle with
poverty till he writes, in 1895, The Time
Machine. There was still hard work
ahead, but success was his.
His literary output was enormous, even
if he did not always make the best use of
his gifts. His first novels were mostly
scientific romances and criticisms of re-
strictive social codes. Two of these early
books, Kipps and The History of Mr.
Polly . which both brought instant com-
parison with Dickens, are probably his
masterpieces. Later he bothered too much
about Utopias and ideal societies, prob-
ably impractical anyway.
Wells’s three encyclopaedic handbooks
have not met with full approval (some-
one said, referring to the Outline of
History, that it was obvious Mr. Wells
had written more history than he had
read); still, they are stupendous achieve-
ments, which alone “would have satis-
fied any normal writer as a life’s work.”
They did bring science, economics and
history to the people in simple language.
In the literary world Wells had his
admirers and detractors, friends and foes.
Brome gives anecdotes. Chesterton and
Wells were firm friends ; yet Wells once
picked a quarrel, soon patched up, over
a book review printed in G.K.’s brother’s
paper (the book reviewed was not by
Wells).
We meet Henry James “prostrate with
admiration” after reading Kipps but,
some years later, deeply hurt by Boon,
which lampooned James the stylist. We
see several flare-ups between Wells and
Shaw, one in 1903 in the Fabian Society
(victory for Shaw) and another in 1934
after Wells’s visit to Russia (drawn).
Here are Shaw and Conrad nearly
coming to blows, with Wells’s assistance;
Conrad took his honor and his writing
very seriously, as Shaw found out one
summer afternoon to Conrad’s cost. They
Inst mei in Wells’s house; and almost be-
fore (he introductions were over Shaw
genially announced, with that forthright
gaiety which exempted him from normal
retaliation, “You know, my dear fellow,
your books won’t do.”
Going very white, Conrad followed Wells
from the room and demanded “Does that
man want to insult me?” “The provoca-
tion to say yes and assist in the subse-
quent duel was great,” Wells wrote, “but I
overcame it. ‘It’s humor,’ I said, and took
Conrad to cool off in the garden.”
Wei Is r eseh ted •'sug^stibns r: that “tie
.should stick to novels, forget about public
brawls and propaganda for this and that.
“I am a journalist. I refuse to play the
artist. He continued to put himself
down on his visa as “Journalist.” And
he never did stop trying: to slay dragons,
“even if some bore the birthmarks of
his own imagination.”
throughout Brome analyses and
criticises Wells’s novels; discusses and
often finds fault with his political,
religious and sociological ideas. He also
shows us Wells the unsuccessful husband,
the too-successful lover; Wells, in petty
vein, raging on learning that his long-
divorced first wife had remarried, but
later settling on her a decent income.
It makes a very readable biography
of a man who “was one of the creators
of modern man,”
K.R.
Reviewed Briefly.
Shikar and Safari: Edison Marshall
(Museum Press). Big-game shooting in
British Columbia, Alaska, Africa and
lado-C hina ; it makes a lively travel-book
in a rather journalistic style and, be-
sides its shooting episodes, is packed with
bits of nature-lore —for example, “The
natural antipathy between the leopard
and the domestic dog is almost as bitter
and malign as that between the dog and
the wolf. A leopard will spend night
after night, with tireless persistence, try-
ing to ambush this hereditary enemy.”

Recent reprints in the “Notable
British Trials” series (William Hodge
and Co. Lid.) offer the oddly-assorted
couple of Trial of Mary Queen of Scots
and Trial of Dr. Lamson ; Dr. Lamson,
glaring forbiddingly above his beard on
the dust-jacket, poisoned his nephew at
Blenheim House School, Wimbledon.
The series, which is nicely printed and
bound by contemporary standards, has
also lately done justice to Crippen, Jessie
M’Lachlan, Rattenbury and Stoner, and
Buck Buxton ; you get the complete trial,
with an authoritative foreword.
The Mountains, the Bush and the Sea :
John Pascoe (Whitcombe and Tombs).
A collection of 97 large photographs,
without letterpress, by the author of
Unclimbed New Zealand. There’s not
much bush and sea in it, but there are
plenty of mountains, mostly from the
South Island ; “Gusty Col, Arrowsmith
Range” is a particularly impressive
chunk of snow and rocky ridges.

The 24th Horse: Hugh Pentecost
(Hale). A no-better-than-she-ought-to-be
glamor-girl is discovered strangled in the
boot of her sister’s car outside an eques-
trian exhibition at Madison Square
Garden, N.Y. Inspector Bradley, of the
Homicide Division, suspects the sister’s
partner in a riding-school, whose wife had
previously disappeared mysteriously;
there are also a broken-down father, .a
rich, brooding playboy, a bright old aunt,
a dressmaker and another murder. The
ingenuities of the piece are ornamental;
the main argument is forced ; and there
is no effort to bring, the horses into the
mystery—-in a first-class detective story
the crime should be peculiar to its setting.

UNIONS AND THE LAW.
Union lawlessness makes it certain that
before long Governments will have to
take a stand to determine who governs
Australia.
At present there are two kinds
of Governments elected Govern-
ments and the union government,
and fresh encroachments by the
latter every week tend to weaken the
authority of Parliaments and Ministries
and strengthen the powers of the unions.
Whenever a “Labor” Government is in
power it gives away more and more to
the unions. When “Labor” is not in
office its leaders generally take the
side of the unions in their lawlessness, or
else stand silent, as Messrs. Chifley,
Evatt and McGirr have been doing in the
last few weeks in respect of the wharf dis-
putes.
In N. S. Wales Mr. McGirr is, to some
extent, at the moment reaping the whirl-
wind ; the leaders of the bus strikers have
taken the stand that they will not be criti-
cised even by a Minister. Irrespective of
the law, of all the principles of decency,
of public rights and convenience, they
were determined to keep their men on
strike until Mr. Sheahan, the one mem-
ber in the N. S. Wales Ministry with an
ounce of commonsense and backbone,
apologised to them for his suggestion that
the strike was part of a Communist con-
spiracy—which it is.
The trend towards compulsory union-
ism, combined with the Communist tech-
nique of standover, blackmail and rule
of industry by force for the benefit of one
section, and irrespective of the interests
of the rest, is becoming the more serious
for several reasons.
One is that the union-leadership is
generally able to force its body to be-
come wholly political. The result is that
basic freedom of conscience, thought and
speech gradually disappears, and a
unionist must conform or be ruined.
An example of how this is working
out is shown by resolutions of executives
and delegates, in which the rank-and-file
of unionists have no hand, to affiliate
with Trades and Labor Councils.
The N. S. Wales Public Service Asso-
ciation took this step some time ago. The
association contains members who have
no sympathy with “Labor.” But the
N. S. Wales Trades and Labor Coun-
cil is an official part of the Australian
political “Labor” party, as is shown by
the directory of that party. And thus
large numbers of persons who do not
subscribe to “Labor” principles and
who personally reprobate much which
“Labor” does are compelled to give both
moral and financial support to a “Labor”
body, one which introduced Communism
into the unions in Australia.
There can be only one end if the trend
is carried to a logical conclusion. From
the present agreement both by unions
and “Labor” political parties that union
members’ funds should be used by execu-
tives to promote the interests of one
political party —even though, as in the
case of the coalminers, ironworkers and
some others, it is not a real party at all but
a treasonable conspiracy—it is only a step
towards making it legal for the unions to
order their members to vote for only one
party. Many of the leaders in key Com-
munist unions even now, by threats of
victimisation of defaulters, do their best
to bring about that end.
The principle of union courts governed
by no statute law is already operating.
Again and again members are
fined under Rafferty rules for making
statements adverse to union policy. As
various moderate members of Communist
unions have learned to their cost in re-
cent years, criticism of the union bosses
is almost as dangerous as criticism of
Stalin in Moscow. They are apt to find
themselves hounded out of the “Labor”
party, which is always demanding free
speech and democracy, and also out of
the union, without membership of which
they are banned from employment in the
jobs they know.
As happened with the unfortunate
officials of the Balmain branch of the
Ironworkers who kicked against the
curious methods of Mr. “Balance-sheet”
Thornton, they may even I be hounded
out of jobs after being expelled, at the
instance of the union.
A more recent instance of union arro-
gance was the determination of the Milk-
carters’ Union to deny supplies to a
vendor, a proceeding utterly outside any
concept of justice and entirely at variance
with the law of the land.
Another disturbing factor in the trend
of “Labor”-party thought on unionism
is the acceptance of the Communist doc-
trine that the -party is more important
than the State, and the party-controlled
State than the individual. In Russia the
real head of the Government is the head
of the Communist party; in Australia
when “Labor” is in Federal power the
real head is already, as acknowledged
by Mr. Chifley, the head of the A.L.P.
In “Labor’s” view the party, as in Russia,
should be the de facto State.
And law is not the will of the people
but the will of the “party,” which in
actuality consists of perhaps one per cent,
of the total population. Crime is
described in Russia as something which
affects the welfare of the party rather
than the welfare of the people, and law
varies as it suits the party irrespective of
the will of a Parliament, which is merely
a registering-machine.
Similar principles are in vogue here
whenever “Labor” is in power. The will
of the party, of which “the organised
strength comes from the unions” (Curtin),
overrides everything. If the law runs
counter to the union will, the law very
often goes to the wall.
Furthermore, “Labor” has now adopted
the startling tenet which not only has no
basis in, but which is actually negatived
by, the Constitutions of the Common-
wealth and all the States: that the trade-
unions have rights to legislate for them-
selves, that this right is exclusive to them,
and that nobody whatever —not even
Parliament itself —has a right to interfere
with it.
This doctrine was heard again and
again in the debates of the Federal Par-
liament’s last session on the secret-ballot
and Arbitration Act Amendment, not
merely from street-corner orators of the
type of Mr. Dan Curtin, but from national
figures like Dr. Evatt, supported by Mr.
A. S. Drakeford, Mr. E. J. Ward and
almost every other “Labor” man who
spoke.
The principle as advocated by them is
that if union officialdom is suspected of
malversation of union funds, of faking
balance-sheets, or of faking elections, no
inquiry must be made, no legislation can
be passed to protect the rank-and-file
and the community. To interfere with
trade-unions, in the dictionary of these
people, would be to “interfere with the
right of the trade-unions to manage their
own business.” Those “rights” these
people seem to consider absolute even
when treason or dishonesty is suspected.
When accusations of malpractice are
made to “Labor” Governments in office
they apply this principle. Mr. McGirr
last week countered the gravest possible
charges made with reference to postal
voting in Federal Clerks’ Union ballots
by having the gag moved. His attitude,
like that of Messrs. Chifley and Hanlon,
is almost totalitarian —that anything is
politically right which maintains the
power of the union leadership and the
permanency of “Labor” in office.
If the general public has a backbone
it should now show it and encourage the
existing non-“ Labor” Commonwealth
Government to take a firm hand to re-
store the rights of the individual and
destroy the insidious trade-union tyranny
which has grown up. This tyranny is
fast wrecking not only industry but also
freedom of speech and action, the Con-
stitution, and statute and common law.
Second Innings.
The Parliament which meets next Tues-
day will be the first effective convention
of the enlarged legislature. In the
previous Parliament Government busi-
ness was entirely frustrated by the
“Labor” rump in the Senate. Its
successor, now to assemble, will
be marked by other special features.
Its first week will be given over
to the Commonwealth Jubilee celebra-
tions. It will, according to plan, next
year have a session opened for the first
time by the reigning monarch on an
official visit to Australia. And it may
run a shorter natural course because the
Constitution requires the next Senate
elections to be held not three, but two,
years hence.
“Labor” obstruction during the recent
Parliament paid a well-deserved penalty
at the general elections last month, and
the people’s response to the Prime
Minister’s able leadership gave Mr.
Menzies the best majority—six to four in
two States —which he could have hoped
for in the Senate under the impracticable
P.R. system of vote-counting. Its slightly
reduced majority in the Representatives
will do the Government more good than
harm, and does not in the least detract
from the outstanding feature of the polls
—an affirmation that the Australian
people meant what they said at the
previous elections. That was to authorise
the Menzies Government to destroy the
Communist fifth-column in this country,
to stamp out political strikes by means of
secret ballots for union elections and for
emergency decisions submitted to the
union rank-and-file, and to rebuild this
country’s defences, in conformity with
action being taken by all the free nations,
as the best chance of preserving world
peace against Soviet Russia’s aggressive
challenge to civilised democracy.
Because of delays imposed by the
“Labor” Opposition during the past 18
months, the urgency of the Government’s
problems—they are the whole nation’s
problems, too —is greater than ever.
There can be allowed no further time-
wasting debates over policy measures
fully aired in the last Parliament and
twice endorsed by the electors. The
amending arbitration bills, the Bank
Bill, the Defence Preparations Bill, and
bills for a referendum on powers neces-
sary to validate emergency legislation
and for reform of electoral pro-
cess for the Senate at a double-dissolu-
tion should all be carried through this
session with a minimum of debate. They
must be got out of the way before the
Royal visitors are due next year, quite
apart from their own urgency under the
Government’s programme. The opening
session will also be greatly occupied with
the new Budget, from which the circum-
stances at home and abroad will require
a more resolute essay in organising the
national finances.
This session should also see the com-
pletion of a peace-settlement with Japan
and with it the corollary Pacific pact
offered to the maritime countries in this
ocean by the United States in reassurance
against fears concerning the peace
terms-—terms, it is true, drawn up mainly
in Washington and found hard to swallow
by more than one of the victor-peoples,
but inescapable in the hash Russia’s
eastern aggression has made of Allied
policy as shaped at Japan’s surrender six
years ago.
The proposed Pacific Pact —ardently
sought by post-war Australian Govern-
ments from both sides of Parliament —
only confirms and strengthens the need
for a rearmament of this country already
recognised as obligatory in face of the
Soviet’s challenge to all the democracies
(including our own), the threat especially
to the English-speaking group among
them in the United Nations, and the
wasting to skeleton-size of Australian
fighting services. There could be no more
dangerous incongruity than the extreme
vulnerability today of Australia to hostile
attack and the accepted purpose of organ-
ising this country as an industrial
stronghold and military base for any
future war-emergency in the Pacific.
The job of work facing the new Parlia-
ment is formidable enough without the
call that must be made upon it in
acquittal of the Government’s prime
mandate from the electors —namely, to
oust all the Communist wreckers from
executive positions amid the Common-
wealth’s key industries. “Labor’s” delay-
ing efforts, exemplified last year in the
Opposition’s obstruction on behalf of
these traitors in Parliament and the
Deputy Opposition-Leader’s fight for
them in wig and gown in the law courts,
will doubtless be continued, however
hopeless the contest, especially in the
form of propaganda to confuse the mass
of Australian trade-unionists. The Prime
Minister seems to have little hope that
all State Governments will agree to
transfer required powers to the Com-
monwealth, and a referendum to seek
those powers directly appears inevitable.
The Communists’ friends in the “Labor”
party obviously have at their hand some
means of further obstruction by cam-
paigning against such a referendum.
Forthcoming political and industrial con-
ferences called to decide Socialist policy
on this issue will meet bitterly divided,
but continued opposition to the plain
decision of the Australian people will
only relegate “Labor” to the political
wilderness.
In this Parliament, too, “Labor’s”
routed ranks have to refashion their own
front. The party’s leaders have been dis-
credited and their obstruction of Gov-
ernment action against Communist
union bosses has been matched by their
official toleration of the Communist
white-anting of that national character
and robust appeal which stamped
“Labor’s” youthful enthusiasm for the
Commonwealth’s development as a Power
in the southern hemisphere.
“Labor’s” lip-service to the British
sentiments and allegiance still dominating
Australia, and to the U.N.O. Charter
which its discredited deputy-leader once
paraded with almost proprietary interests,
is exposed and derided by the com-
placency with which it allows its militant
elements to wave over its befuddled head
an alien and hostile flag. The rot has
eaten to the bone indeed when the whole
“movement” is prostrated on being faced
by the acid-test whether to support or
condemn a mob of Moscow-led wreckers
who have been doing their best to over-
throw the authority of the elected Gov-
ernment of New Zealand, as a prelude to
the overthrow of our own.
If this forlorn political mob calling
itself “Labor” has any desire whatever
to check prices and living costs —the pro-
fession with which it lately pretended it
could sweep the polls—its duty is now to
collaborate with the Government in every
move to increase the output of coal and
to cure the shameful blockade by the
wharf union of our ports. The Com-
munist union bosses have made clear that
these basic industries will function bene-
ficially for the nation only over their
politically-dead bodies. That warning is
written over the doors of this Parliament
as it opens, and the Menzies Government
is incontrovertibly committed to taking
up the challenge and wringing the neck
of this insolent lawlessness.
A worth-while job for Jubilee year.
Mr. Menzies asked for it, and the country
has twice approved, the second time
specifically, at his request, in the Senate
elections. Let him now go to it.
Headmasters' Conference.
The atmosphere of the eighth triennial
meeting of the Great Public Schools
Headmasters’ Conference, held in Sydney,
was refreshing, and almost unique in its
times. The meeting appeared to be
more concerned with doing something for
others than for its individual members.
A conference which puts in the forefront
of the resolutions an expression of its
satisfaction with the public and Govern-
ment attitude to its work, with the
“concern of the Federal Government in
University finances, with the Common-
weath Scholarship Scheme and the greatly
improved salaries of teachers in all
States,” goes right off the beaten track.
The custom of most conferences—
indeed, the purpose of most of them —is
to persuade the world that the members
are victims of the most dastardly pinch-
ing by ungrateful employers and of un-
worthy parsimony by the Government.
Conferences usually propagate the idea
that life is lived only to grab everything
that can be grabbed, including money,
leisure, the right to go slow and the right
to do work in a slovenly way.
In contrast to this shabby attitude,
which develops in conferences even of
persons who esteem themselves profes-
sionals, it is novel and heartening to find
the headmasters’ conference uttering such
dicta as “those who enter the teach-
ing profession must regard it as a voca-
tion,” and concerned with “moral growth
built upon a necessary habitual vision of
greatness.”
The view of the conference and its
sterling advocacy of learning for learn-
ing’s sake sounds like a voice from a
more golden past. And even its one
small burst of pessimism, occupied with
the reflection that there is all too little
care for the virtues of discipline and
obedience in Australia, may be forgiven.
For any weakening in the forward-look-
ing spirit of optimism which should be
the spur of every teacher is well com-
pensated for by the conference’s pro-
nouncement that the maintenance of the
necessary standard of high ideals “de-
mands from the teacher whole-time devo-
tion, which cannot be offered by those
who are preoccupied with their own
rights.”
Such a spirit of self-sacrifice will prob-
ably appear to most of the hardy toilers
of the Golden Age as something akin to
sabotage.
The example of the conference, how-
ever, went far beyond the formulation
of its own moral and public-spirited
credo. When it received a visit from a
member of the Army Board it “expressed
to him the desire of all schools that the
Cadet Corps should be regarded as an
integral part of the Australian defence
plan and receive support and encourage-
ment proportionate to their importance.
An enthusiastic cadet corps whose
members leave school with the right out-
look on defence and a basic knowledge of
training and weapons means half the
battle in providing sufficient men for the
services and shortening their period m
camp.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Muddle and Mess.
Advance notices continue to be emitted
of Mr. McGirr’s impending retirement
from the N.S.W. Premiership. His A.L.P.
executive derides him, his caucus ignores
him, and only the party slogan which
would put a blind parrot into Parliament
if it got the junta’s pre-selection would
ever have re-elected him.
He has in his Premier’s career touched
nothing which he has not blighted, made
no effort which has not stagnated public
business, succeeded only in setting sloth
and failure as the badge of all he
attempted. He has for the past two years
stayed in office on some string of political
existence which the Trades Hall executive
has refrained, to the misery of all N. S.
Wales and perhaps of himself, from
cutting off.
The news of his positively final appear-
ance, after at least two past threats of
retirement, is breathlessly awaited. He
can depart only to the accompaniment of
deeper blackouts, acuter paralysis of all
transport, more insolent defiance by
employees in nationalised services of the
State’s authority—all these debaucheries
of daily working activities growing worse
the longer he stays. His Parliamentary
majority, the meanest which could sup-
port any Administration, exists on a ballot
still uncleared from charges of fraud.
Such Press statements of what he refuses
to do —albeit superfluous —are commonly
delivered by “a spokesman,” not infre-
quently by the chairman of his outside
executive.
His 40-hour week legislation obviously
embarrassed the Arbitration Court
during the concluding stages of its hearing
of the issue. New South Wales has been
lamed ever since. To all militant union
bosses it meant that the McGirr Govern-
ment could be pushed about as they
wished. It has bankrupted every transport
service—railways, trams, buses, ferries
—and is now slowly bringing them all
to a stop. With coal resources available
to meet any demand and works that can
produce the cheapest steel in the world,
the McGirr Government has steered N. S.
Wales (and much of industry in other
States dependent on it) into a morass of
everlasting power blackouts, afflicting
industries and householders alike. Bidding
for office on promises that he would
prevent all power-shortages, build a house
for every man who wanted one, replace
Sydney’s appalling tram-equipment with
new and more and better rolling-stock,
and end all strikes, he has watched, un-
moved by any impulse to activity, a drift
of the entire community into conditions
which would have prompted even the
aboriginal blacks to shift elsewhere.
The appalling thing about their stagna-
tion is that this masquerader as a Govern-
ment-leader does not even see it.
His latest observations on the scene of
disaster, broadcast last Christmas, were
delivered in words of self-congratulation
on the happiness and prosperity that he
had brought to the chief industrial State
of Australia.
The best thing he can do in this lubilee
year is to go ; but the harm he has done
will live a long time after him.
Success in "Labor" Politics.
Last week N. S. Wales “Labor” and the
civil service celebrated with wine but not
song the completion of a decade of
Ministerial office by Mr. Robert (“Bob”)
Heffron, Minister for Education in suc-
cessive N.S.W. “Labor” Governments.
Mr. Heffron appeared politically in
1922 under the auspices of the Com-
munist party, announcing that “to the
utmost dismay of world capitalism and
to the intense admiration of the intelligent
proletariat in all lands the Russian
revolution dawns with the Soviet Gov-
ernment still in the ascendant and the
forces of capitalist exploitation con-
founded on every hand.”
He averred that
By supplanting the capitalist dictatorship
with the proletarian dictatorship, by meet-
ing the force of White armies with the force
of Red armies, by combating the White
Terror with the Red Terror, by scientifi-
cally organising our industrial forces along
the lines of the Red Trade Union Inter-
national we will reach the goal of our
dreams on the road to which Russia is the
greatest milestone passed.
Mr. Heffron, as one of Mr. J. S.
Garden’s back-room boys, got along
quickly. He became, and was frequently
advertised in the Communist Press as, the
tutor in public-speaking of the Com-
munist party’s speakers’-training classes.
He was elected to the State House for
Botany in 1930. In 1936, according to
the official report of the A.L.P. Executive,
then under the control of Mr. Lang, he
was one of those “automatically ex-
pelled” from the party for associating
himself with the Communist-organised
United. Front Conference, and in the 1938
elections he led to the polls the section
of “Labor” favoring a united front with
the Communists. By 1939-40 he was the
political spokesman for the Hughes-
Evans group, which controlled N. S.
Wales ‘Tabor.”
In the Communist party’s official
History of the Australian Labor Move-
ment, the head of the Marx School, a
Russian-trained import (E. W. Campbell),
paid tribute to his services to the Left and
the United Front Movement.
Soon after this Mr. Heffron turned up
as Minister for National Security in Mr.
McKefi’s Ministry ; and now Mr. Heffron
is Minister in charge of the education
system of Australia’s premier State. That
education system is infiltrated with Com-
munism ; the president of the Teachers’
Federation is a leading Communist, and
its executive is controlled by Com-
munists. Mr. Heffron, who now is a
member of a Ministry which is sup-
posedly the enemy of Communism, seems
to be doing very little about this state of
affairs.
Mr. Heffron is being named as a
possible successor to Mr. McGirr in the
Premiership—indeed, a very likely one,
since it was reported in the official
“Labor” “Standard” that when the elec-
tion of leader took place in 1947 on Mr.
McKell’s retirement, Mr. Heffron was
runner-up in the ballot, only two or
three votes separating Mr. Heffron and
Mr. McGirr.
The Butter Shortage.
“Dick Turpin”: Butter is not the
only product that is being neglected
in the race for easy money; other
essential industries are drifting into
the doldrums and carrying our
economy with them. There are some
superficial reasons for the butter short-
age—farmers are selling their raw milk
to processors who have built ice-cream
and dried-milk factories, and the con-
sumption of raw milk in the cities has
increased —but these are not the basic
problems. The real causes are the acute
shortage of labor in any other than the
pampered industries, and the general ten-
dency of farmers to switch to easier and
more profitable forms of production.
During a trip to the far South Coast
of N. S. Wales I was surprised to see
sheep grazing on coastal land that was
obviously suited for dairying and quite
unsuitable for sheep-raising. In inland
areas, once valuable sources of butter,
the swing to sheep has been more pro-
nounced, of course, and is more under-
standable.
When Professor Oliphant referred to
wool as Australia’s greatest potential
danger he was howled down by those
enjoying the inflated return from the
country’s sacred animal. In the long run,
however, some of the newer graziers,
especially those raising on unsuitable land
sheep bought at peak prices, will dis-
cover the truth of the professor’s warning.
The boom price for wool has been
accompanied by many evils, not the least
of which is the terrific gulf that has been
created between the incomes of graziers
and other sections of the community with
comparable investments and comparable
responsibilities.
It is little wonder that the dairy-
farmer who can change to wool-produc-
tion does so ; and in view of the long
hours they work, and the small return
they get, those who have left the industry
altogether and sold their farms cannot be
blamed for following their labor to the
40-hour week and the easy pickings of
the cities. The attitude with which the
dairy cocky is regarded officially was well
outlined in the cost-of-production schedule
contained in the recently-issued “Hand-
book on Dairying,” a Commonwealth
Department of Agriculture publication.
The schedule included the labor of
farmers’ children aged 10 and upwards!
Under present conditions there is little
that can be done to overcome the butter
shortage. Official appeals are worse than
useless, and a further subsidy would not
bridge the gap between butter and other
agricultural products, which are, besides,
much easier to produce.
With the country’s population increasing
at the rate of 300,000 a year, the lag in
production for home consumption can
only become greater with time. And so
Australians, who boast of their natural
resources and wide-open spaces, will have
to import butter from New Zealand —if
they can get it —-at the expense of the
hard-pressed British consumer.
Rather a high price to pay for a 40-
hour week and a few other empty
luxuries.
In Asia.
“Ek Dum” on Asia:
The Korean battle is running a familiar
course. The Communists advanced in huge
force. They threatened to burst open the Allied
lines like a jam-tin. The Allies, chiefly Ameri-
can, with new, mysterious weapons, hurled
them back, routed, broken and beaten. Sixty
thousand of them were in a trap —from which,
as usual, they escaped. Tens of thousands
had been killed —the official U.S. tally of
slaughter of Chinese and North Koreans since
last June has reached something near the mil-
lion-mark. . .
The Allies roared on “irresistibly,” with their
propaganda departments shouting in triumph
—that is, until they reached the usual enemy
main lines. The enemy then began to put up
a terrific resistance. The irresistible Allied
advance stopped. It was announced that the
Allied offensive was ended. The usual poli-
ticians and diplomatists took over.
The fact emerged—again as usual —that what
the U.N.O. Allies were engaged in was a de-
fence against aggression, and surmise began to
arise as to whether peace could not be ob-
tained by stopping at the 38th Parallel and
negotiating with the Chinese. It was rumored
that plans for negotiation were in being.
As a help to negotiation the United States
Senate Committee inquiring into General Mac-
Arthur’s charges is sitting hearing evidence pub-
licly and privately, though it doesn’t matter how
it hears it, since it appears to leak immedi-
ately to the newspapers. Mr, Acheson gave his
quota of aid towards peace over the weekend
by testifying that Formosa would be defended
if attacked by the Communist Chinese.
The move for peace is being attributed
generally in the United States to Britain.
Actually Canada was the first sober nation to
make a move. The U.S. Legislature, as well as
Mr. Acheson, is doing its share to make
negotiation in Korea impossible by its resolu-
tions to bar any country which exports goods to
Red China from American aid.
Unless it suits the Communists to strike else-
where, the hope of beating the innumerable
Chinese under present conditions or bringing
them to agreement is small. It would be small
even if everybody were conciliatory and if there
were no Chiang Kai-shek to be considered as
an obstacle to settlement.
The Persian business looms more and more
dangerously. Russian Radio every day fans
the flames of hate. The intervention of Presi-
dent Truman has seemingly confirmed in the
minds of the Persian "Government the belief
that Britain is now a feeble thing to be insulted
and treated with contempt. The Persian
response to Mr. Truman’s interference was to
do just this and to refuse to negotiate with
the British Foreign Office, or anybody except
Anglo-Iranian Oil.
Russian Radio is exhorting the Arabs to
follow the suit of the Persians by throwing out
the American oil companies.
British parachute troops have been sent to
Cyprus after being addressed by Field-Marshal
Montgomery as if they were going straight
into action. Mr. Chifley will no longer be able
to quote his dictum that there is no danger of
war for 10 years, since Montgomery told the
parachute-men that they were being sent to
Cyprus “to be in a better position to take some
action quickly if needed.”
In Australia there is little public concern
about the threats which loom over us from
Asia. When Major-General Lloyd, one of the
bravest fighting soldiers of World War I, made
an appeal for recruits at the League football
match against the visiting Frenchmen he was
hooted by a section of the crowd. There was
no public indignation at the shocking incident.
The only Sydney paper to comment thought the
recruiting authorities had been ill-advised to
interfere with the pleasures of the mob.
All that seems to matter is whether most of
the population can loaf half the week, whether
the s.p. and the square-dances and the bodgie-
widgie sessions are functioning efficiently.
The country is due for a rude awakening. And
let nobody think that the next war, if it comes,
is going to be a nice, prosperous garden-party
for most of the population, financed by visit-
ing Americans.
The A.B.C.'s "Forum."
From M. F. Dixon, formerly head of the
A.B.C.’s news department;
The A.B.C.’s policy of weighting the scales
in favor of the “Left " (B. 23/5/’5l) applied
also to news a couple of years ago; and even
at the beginning of the recent Federal election
campaign quite a deal of space was given in
the “national” bulletins to the policy and plans
of the Communist party.
I recall about four years ago a senior journa-
list in the A.B.C. news department nearly
losing his job because he labelled Stan Moran,
an official of the Waterside Workers’ Federation
[and a leading Communist official], who was
sponsoring some apparently harmless move, as a
“well-known member of the Communist party.”
A party member wrote to the commission
under the guise of an “impartial listener” say-
ing that when she telephoned to protest agkinst
the label which had been attached to Moran
she had been told by a member of the A.B.C.
news staff that he knew better than she did
and had no intention of retracting anything.
The journalist was solemnly told later, on the
authority of the commission, that such labels
were not in keeping with the commission’s policy
of “strict impartiality” towards all sections of
the community and he had better not offend
again. ... 0 J
At the 1948 news-editors conference in Syd-
ney a strong move was made to secure com-
mission approval for the banning of Com-
munist propaganda, under the guise of news,
from A.B.C. bulletins. Only one man opposed
the move; but eventually his “arguments” won
commission approval, and the news staff was
told it must continue to give “fair and equal
treatment to all sectiohs of the community."
If the Menzies Government is to get any-
where in its campaign to curb the "Reds’* it
must crack down on the publicity which they
always seem to be able to get, in ony way or
another, through the national broadcasting
service.
"Amazing Piffle."
In an address delivered to the Science
Congress in Brisbane last week, Mr. A.
A. Morrison, a senior history lecturer at
Queensland University, made some critical
comments on the electoral system in
Hanlon’s State.
There was nothing very new in what
he said, but the significance of his state-
ments was that they were made before a
gathering of scientists, in an atmosphere
completely removed from politics, Mr.
Morrison said that the Queensland Gov-
ernment was in a better position for vote-
rigging and gerrymandering of electorates
than any other Government in Australia.
It was also in a better position to stifle
criticism of such action. He added that
electoral changes had been made to suit
the needs of the moment, quoting as an
example the last redistribution, which
set very low quotas for country districts
where the A.W.U, "was strong. This
appeared “dangerously close to expedi-
ency.” It certainly did, though a stronger
word than expediency might be found
for it.
When Brisbane “Courier-Mail” referred
these remarks to Attorney-General Lar-
combe he was full of righteous indigna-
tion. Describing the speech as “amazing
piffle,” he delivered himself thus:
Mr. Morrison’s offensive and untrue re-
marks lacked even the attribute of origin-
ality. He merely repeated what certain
disgruntled politicians have said after
each election at which they have been
defeated.
What Mr. Larcombe doesn’t seem to
realise is that Mr. Morrison’s remarks
are all the more important for not being
original. It is the very fact of their being
so oft repeated that gives them their point.
Mr, Larcombe and his colleagues may
deny as often as they please that their
party has been guilty of gerrymander-
ing, but they cannot deny the main theme
of Mr. Morrison’s address —that no Gov-
ernment is in a better position than theirs
for gerrymandering.
If they don’t like hearing the accusa-
tion, the remedy is in their own hands,
and it has been told them as often as
the accusation has been made. They
have only to fall into fine with other
States and use the Federal rolls. Until
they do so they will have to put up with
what Mr. Larcombe professes to regard
as “amazing piffle.”
Living Costs and Transport.
McGirk’s railways have had to announce
a three-day “holiday” during which they
won’t take any freight other than “urgent
perishables” because of the back-log of
freight piled up in goods-yards. The
usual excuses are given—lack of man-
power, increased freights, and the rest
of it —though the real culprit is McGirr
himself, architect of the 40-hour week.
Though freight is thus piled Up and
the railways can’t carry it, there is no
hint of any relaxation of the restrictions
and penalties on road transport. Any-
body using that form of transport has to
contribute heavily to railway revenue and
be put to endless trouble obtaining per-
mits.
Most business firms, having given up
hope of shipping and rail transport, have
turned to the roads and are paying the
high taxes, knowing that the consumer
pays in the end and the cost of living is
kicked up again.
Goods road-hauled from Adelaide to
Brisbane cost £5O to £55 a ton, compared
with £33 by rail and £6 to £7 by sea. But
three State Governments take their whack
of the road freight. From Brisbane to
Wafiangarra in Queensland road tax is
41s. 6d. a ton, total tax on a 12-ton load
Albury to Wailangarra in N.S.W. is £196,
Victoria charges £5 for a permit over its
roads and may charge an additional tax
up to ss. a ton a mile. South Australia
charges a similar permit fee unless truck
and goods are owned by the firm handling
the goods.
There is to be a conference in Adelaide
this month of these State transport-
strangulation boards whereat “it is hoped
to remove certain anomalies.” The whole
business of penal taxation of road trans-
port is anomalous, and so long as any
State holds the arbitrary right to deny a
road-permit to a carrier the constitutional
right of free trade between the States is
infringed. But nobody need hope the
Adelaide conference will discuss that,
though it’s high time the people realised
just how much these unnecessary and un-
justified taxes on transport bump up costs.
Possum Butchery.
Lovers of native animals won’t be
satisfied with the reasons given by A. D.
Butcher, director of Victoria’s Fisheries
and Game Department, for declaring an

CARRERAS LIMITED — OVER 150 YEARS REPUTATION FOR DUALITY
open season for possum slaughter in the
State.
Mr. Butcher is quoted as saying that
possums are killing trees by eating the
leaves therefrom, thus causing “serious
economic loss,” and that the possum
population ought to be reduced for its
own good:
The huge and growing possum popula-
tion is outstripping its own food-supply
and should be reduced in the possums’
own interests.
That won’t hold water, for nature
makes her own adjustments in these
matters and can be trusted to reduce the
possums if they really are short of food.
On trees, Mr. Butcher puts it this
way:
There are tens of thousands of possums
living on young foliage in Melbourne and
suburbs. Many landholders do not realise
that the grey or brush-tail possum is
killing their trees They are so numerous,
especially in redgum country, that a large-
scale destruction drive is regarded as
essential.
Before Victoria lets loose what
Mr. Butcher calls a “controlled war” on
possums, it should want more convincing
reasons than these.
POLITICAL POINTS
“Premier Will Resign,” shrieked a red
stop-press headline in a Sydney afternoon
paper last Friday. Most of those who
rushed to buy it were disappointed; it
was talking of the Premier of Persia.
Of the 75 members who comprised the
House of Representatives when the King,
then Duke of York, opened Parliament
House in Canberra in 1927, only four
will participate, as M.H.Rs., in next
week’s Jubilee junketings. First on the
list, of course, is Billy Hughes, to whom
the event will also be a personal jubilee ;
the others are Earle Page and H. P.
Lazzarini (1919) and Jos. Francis (1922).
There are no Senators of the 1927 vintage
in the present Parliament.
All six State Governors will be in
Canberra for Tuesday’s ceremony, as they
were for the 1927 shivoo. On that occa-
sion Melba sang the National Anthem
from the steps of Parliament House;
this time Marjorie Lawrence will take
her place.
Jack Lang saved his deposit at the
N. S. Wales Senate election —the only un-
successful candidate to do so ; he finished
up with 108,372 votes. The quota for
N.S.W. was 156,138 and after the ninth
place was filled —by Liberal McMullen —
Stan Amour, with 133,327 votes, was
still a fair way short of it. Elimination
of the low-markers, including the Commo
team with its bonus of first-place votes,
made Amour the tenth Senator. Stan
hasn’t had such a hard struggle for a
seat since his celebrated plane trip from
San Francisco,
The glorious First of June! On Friday,
the front page of “S. M. Herald” carried
five headings; four of them referred to
cuts —bus services, railways goods traffic,
milk and butter.
Speaker Lamb, of the N. S. Wales
Assembly, rebuked his flock last week
for conducting themselves in a disorderly
manner while a party of schoolboys was
in the gallery. He told members that it
was his desire that when schoolchildren
visited the House they should “carry
away with them a very high opinion of
the way Parliament is conducted.” The
Speaker’s desire is understandable;
members apparently thought it more im-
portant that the youngsters should carry
away a true picture.
Another Budget slug has been fore-
shadowed by P.M.G. Anthony, who has
not been able to stem the drift of the
post-office into annual deficit begun under
the Ancient Cameron. Increased postage-
rates and telephone charges have already
reduced public custom in these essential
services, and radio licences seem to be
due to feel the inflation draught. Nobody
in the postal department seems to have
heard of the efficacy of reducing rates
as a method of increasing turnover.
Libs in N. S, Wales and South Aus-
tralia held their ground in by-elections
held last Saturday. In Burwood (N.S.W.)
Dr, L. J. A. Parr finished up over 900
ahead of the combined totals of his
“Labor” and Independent opponents;
Glen Pearson had an easy win in Flinders
(S.A.), the seat formerly held by his
brother, now a Senator.
With Dr. Parr’s election and the re-
election (unopposed) of Ivan Black
(Neutral Bay), the Opposition in the N. S.
Wales Assembly is back at full strength
and the Government once more relies on
the favor of expelled “Labor” man
Geraghty for a continuance of its reign.
In yet another country proportional-
representation is responsible for a con-
dition of near-deadlock. At the Eire
general election the Costello group, plus
supporting Independents, won 71 seats
and De Valera’s Fianna Fail 69. Seven
other Independents have yet to decide
whom to be independent of.
The Communist-led wharfies of New
Zealand demonstrated their fervor for the
brotherhood of man last week by (1)
brutally attacking police in the main street
of Auckland during the progress of a
“protest” procession ; (2) brutally assault-
ing the president of the new law-abiding
waterside union at a tram-stop; (3)
throwing a member of the Stevedoring
Commission out of a meeting “by the
scruff of the neck.” All this is no doubt
part of the “World Peace Movement”
to which the Communist leaders of the
waterside Lumpenproletariat profess to be
so ardently attached.
McGrrrrr’s deputy—one of the political
Cahill clan —speaking on the bill to
authorise the Cumberland County Council
plan:
Sydney’s unplanned and spasmodic
growth during 150 years has caused chaotic
conditions which can no longer be disre-
garded.
During the last three or four years the
McGrnrr has resisted every effort to per-
suade him to cease disregarding it. That
he is about .to give up what he calls lead-
ing a Government accounts for a burst
of energy—hardly equal, however, to
dealing with the bus strike —in the most
bone-idle, bone-headed Ministry that ever
went to sleep in N. S, Wales.
Vic. railways expect to drop &2\ million
this financial year. Big increases in wages
and costs and an eight weeks’ strike in
1950 are blamed. The Commissioner
says he is 5000 short in staff and appears
to believe that if that gap could be
filled things would be better. It would
cut down the overtime bill, but think how
many more Jackie Brown could bring
out on strike when the Comrades ordered
it.
Aftermath of last year’s extraordinary
floods in the N.S.W. coastal dairy country,
added to other things, brought Sydney to
the verge of a butter famine this month,
distributing companies saying “unofficial”
rationing would be introduced and that
supplies were away below normal. The
usual hoarders have been at work and
there is the usual cry from agricultural
pressure groups for increased prices.
These, it is held, would “encourage men
to stay in the industry and improve pro-
duction,” Something more than that is
needed ; increased egg- and potato-prices
haven’t increased supplies of either.
Beautiful Eva Perdn, wife of Argen-
tina’s President, told some visiting Japan-
ese about her husband. “He is a god
to us,” she said, “so much so that we
cannot conceive Heaven without Peron.
He is our sun, our air, our water, our
life.” Few husbands get such tributes
from their wives. All the same, this god
wasn’t so all-seeing that he couldn’t have
his leg pulled by one of his scientists,
who said he had harnessed the atom with
the simplest apparatus and at a fraction
of the cost of methods used by other
countries,
There’s to be a fresh trial of the case
in which Queensland’s Chief Electoral
Officer, B, J. Maguire, is charged with
forging ballot papers in connection with
the Bulimba election in 1950; after de-
liberating for five hours the jury reported
that they were unable to agree on a
verdict. Evidence in the case turned
mainly upon the testimony of handwriting
experts and upon Maguire’s opportunities
to commit the offence with which he was
charged. In summing up, the judge
warned the jury not to allow themselves
to be influenced by political or religious
bias.
Opposing a motion by Opposition-
leader Treatt that the N. S. Wales Govern*
meat should organise emergency transport
to cater for the thousands of people
affected by the bus-mechanics’ strike,
McGrrrrr said:
Mr. Treatt’s method has been followed
in New Zealand by men of his calibre.
Men, women and children of every class of
society suffered acutely because of hasty
action by men not seized with knowledge to
deal with a matter of this nature.
Ignoring the implied disapproval of the
Holland Government’s action against the
Red wreckers, the assumption is that
McGrrrrr considers that he and his col-
leagues possess the knowledge “necessary
to deal with a matter of this nature.”
On past experience their method is to
adopt an attitude of masterly inactivity.
One thing they can never be accused of
is hasty action —or any action.
Jap war trials are over, but Moscow
trials are still on. Last week the Red
dictators of the Clerks’ Union interro-
gated 12 shipping clerks who refused to
stop work when the wharfies did so a few
weeks ago in protest against the High
Court’s dismissal of Roach’s appeal. One
of the commissars had the effrontery to
tell the men that they had rendered them-
selves liable to having their registration
cancelled, which would mean they could
not continue in their jobs as tally-clerks.
What sort of crazy land is this in which
by doing his job a man risks losing it?
It’ll be nice for Federal politicians to
get back to Canberra on June 12 and
forget about blackouts, no eggs, no beer,
no potatoes, no butter, no sugar, no buses
and all the rest of it.
Bosses of the Victorian branch of the
A.R.U.—chief commissar, J. J. Brown —
have decided to give their members the
blessing of a “secret” ballot. In the past,
ballot-papers had to be signed, but this
will no longer be necessary. Members
of a suspicious turn of mind are seeing
a sinister motive behind the new rule,
which provides that each paper shall be
numbered, but the executive has explained
that officials will be “requested” not to
take a note of the numbers when issuing
papers. As if Mr. Brown, for example,
would dream of doing such a thing!
A batch of a hundred or so misled
youngsters—some of them suspected of
dodging the call-up-—is off to a phoney
“Youth Festival” in Berlin (Russian
sector). Who’s paying their expenses is
anybody’s guess. While these young
nieces and nephews of Uncle Joe are over
the other side Menzies should empower
them to invite a couple of hundred young
Russians to visit Australia, at our expense,
to experience at first-hand the miseries of
life under capitalism.
Stirred by criticism of his regime, Dr.
Malan is threatening that his Govern-
ment may be forced to establish a “free
and independent republic” as Transvaal
and the Orange River Colony were
“forced to do last century.” Let’s see.
What became of those free and indepen-
dent republics?
Tasmania is meaning because 500,000
bags of spuds are stuck there and can’t
get to hungry mainland markets. One
or other of the dozen or so Potato Board
secretaries blames shipping delays—maybe
the ships would get going if they had
as many hands as have all these com-
modity boards.
When Communist Rowe’s A.E.U. laid
Australian industry idle in 1947 he boasted
that his 17,000 members did not suffer
because most of them got casual jobs
with other employers. Now the same
thing is reported of the A.E.U. bus
mechanics on strike in Sydney, yet these
employers belong to that great majority
of the community who demand that the
Menzies Government shall crush these
Communist strikes!
Giving reasons for the anticipated £2
million loss on McGrrmr trams this year,
transport officials blame, among other
things, “fewer passengers because of the
20 p.c. fare increases.” Ah, if only it had
been 20 p.c.! There isn’t a tram
passenger in Sydney paying less than
100 p.c. increase on 1939 first-section
fares, to which must be added a Id. sur-
charge for travel after 8 p.m. on week-
days and any time at weekends.
From “People’s China,” (Feb. 16), pub-
lished officially in Peking and sold by
the Australian Communist party:
China’s 5,000,000-strong People’s Libera-
tion Army has a reserve and ancillary
force of more than 5,500,000 people’s
militiamen.
Strange, since Mao told the Communist-
party conference in Peking last June that
the Army had been whittled down to
1,000,000. Ten and a half million seems
a lot for a country which is “ardently
devoted to the cause of world peace.”
As a joint statement of Canadian
Labor bodies saw it:
Compulsory arbitration will not work.
Australia has had it for 46 years... .In
1948 the number of strikes and lockouts in
Australia was 1141, in Canada (under
collective bargaining) 154. In the first nine
months of 1949 Australia had more than
600 stoppages, Canada 137 for the year.
The Canadians use this as an argument
against changing their collective bargain-
ing system for compulsory arbitration.
They forget, however, that in the two
periods quoted, Australia had the Chifley
“Labor” Government, which wouldn’t
enforce labor laws.
Austerity features forecast for the next
Federal Budget include a stiller tax on
companies, as much as another shilling
in the pound, in line with the Copland
formula for combating inflation, and also
to deflect public investment from more
payable industrials to Commonwealth
bonds, whose low interest returns are
leaving the public distinctly cold.
It is obvious now that the mistake
Sydney people made when the Yanks cap-
tured their city in 1942 was not to make
them keep it.

Industry and inflation
Wool prices went lower again
last week Most severely
affected have been the poorer
types of wool. The decline from
the highest peaks reached by
better - quality wools, which
make up the greater part of the
clip, has not been so marked ;
and, in any case, prices gener-
ally are still above the averages
for 1949-50.
The statistical position of
wool is still very strong, subject
to any release from military
stockpiles for commercial pur-
poses.
The effect of the wool-price
decline has been hardly notice-
able on ’Change. There has
been a weakening recently, but
last week firmness again became
evident. There is little doubt,
however, that a good deal of
sharemarket support in recent
months has come from the
pastoral industry. With wool
prices at present levels it will
probably go on.
The majority of new-share
issues continue to be snapped
up. Few outsiders got in on the
issue made by Marrickville
Holdings (margarine), and F. J.
Walker ords., which were
placed at 13s. 10d., last week
had opening sales at 18s. Many
people who applied for more
than 200 John Vicars shares got
part of their money back.
An increasing problem
throughout industry is the diffi-
culty of financing purchases of
new stock. With the basic wage
and other factors sending prices
ever higher, in very few cases
will proceeds from the sale of
last year’s merchandise, even
after retention of profits, meet
the cost of replacing a similar
volume of stock and satisfy taxa-
tion commitments. That is
ignoring any distribution of
profits altogether.
This stock - replacement
problem is affecting all busi-
nesses, great and small. Builders
and shopkeepers operating on
their own are finding it just as
much a difficulty as the big
concern. And woollen mills in
particular have found the strain
a severe one. It is the reason
why many concerns are today
seeking more “working capital.”
Because it is costing more to
replace stock than they received
for the old, and because current
depreciation provisions are not
enough to replace plant when it
is ultimately worn out, many
concerns are paying dividends
out of capital at the present
time. They are, in fact, to a
smaller extent experiencing what
happened in Germany during
its great inflation—they are
“selling themselves poor.”
The whole economic policy of
Australia needs to be reviewed.
Price-control, taxation. Budget
policy, the exchange-rate and
many other matters should be
re-examined concurrently with
the Government’s efforts to raise
per capita production.
Inflation that was at first con-
sidered to be a comparatively
short-term problem has turned
out to be, because of post-war
trade-union policy, a long-term
one, and it must be considered
as a long-term one. The longer
it renjains a problem the more
serious it threatens to get, as
witnessed by the progressively
higher cost-of-living additions
to the basic wage.
Inflation is something that
will have to be given full con-
sideration by taxation and price-
control authorities. It is begin-
ning to upset all previously
conceived ideas about economic
equity.
Marrickville Holdings, Ltd.
Formed as a medium for con-
verting Marrickville Margarine
Pty., Ltd., and Nut Foods Pty.,
Ltd., into publicly - controlled
companies, Marrickville Hold-
ings, Ltd., has issued 821,250 £1
ords. for the ord. capital in both
these concerns. It is issuing
200,000 4| p.c. cum. redeemable

prefs. to the A.M.P. Society, the
proceeds of which will be used
to take up 200,000 new ords. in
Marrickville Margarine, which in
turn will use the money for re-
deeming a previous issue of
200,000 4} p.c. prefs. held by the
A.M.P.
The public has also been
offered 150,000 £1 ords. at a
premium of 10s. by the new
holding co. When this new
money is in paid capital will be
£1,171,250, of which £971,250
will be ordinary.
Marrickville Margarine, which
has a present ord. capital of
£365,000, was founded in 1908,
and makes margarine and simi-
lar products, vegetable oils and
stock foods. Nut Foods Pty.,
formed in 1921 as a Margarine
subsidiary, has an ord. capital of
£200,000, and turns out nut pro-
ducts under the trade-name of
Eta. Both concerns have done
very well in the past.
As part of the conversion
arrangements, buildings and the
Marrickville freehold have been
revalued and written up, as have
shares in an N.Z. associate co.
Goodwill has been wiped out
of the books from the result-
ing reserves.
Profits of the subsidiaries for
the year to June 30, 1950, allow-
ing for pref. divs., were equal to
10 p.c. on proposed ord. capi-
tal, and averaged approximately
that percentage for the past five
years.
Net tangible assets will be
21s. 6d. per holding-co. ord.
share when all the new money is
in. Tax-free reserves total
£160,243, equal to 16£ p.c. on the
proposed ord. capital. Assets-
revaluation reserve amounts to
an additional £57,600, general
reserves to £238,407, and the
directors reserve the right to pay
dividends out of the share-
premium reserve (which will be
£75,000) as well.
The business is strongly estab-
lished, and well run. Directors
are Orwell Phillips, A. B. Abel,
R. C. Crebbin, W. Linton and
O. E. Phillips.
Roma Oil Survey
“Petro”: Kalimna Oil stated,
at its general meeting held in
Melbourne on May 30, 1950, that
the seismic survey by the Bureau
of Mineral Resources at Roma,
South Queensland, “should be
completed in about two or three
months” (B. 7/6/’5O). Now,
after a lapse of 12 months, it
says that “a preliminary state-
ment of the results of the recent
seismic survey is expected to be
available soon.”
The delay cannot be explained
by the lack of bureau staff or
funds, but it may be the result of
an attempt by that organisation
to bite off more than it can
chew. It is more probable,
however, that the discovery of
volcanics in the Morelia well at
a depth much shallower than
anticipated has necessitated
a complete recasting of the
bureau’s interpretation of the
geophysical data collected by it
at the public expense over the
three and a half years which it
has spent on the job.
Kalimna’s expenditure for the
year ended February 28 last was
£2240, which indicates that the
total of private funds spent by
the “Associated Companies” at
Roma during that year was just
short of £9OOO. Kalimna’s
development account is now
stated to stand at £16,235,
which suggests that close on
£65,000 has been sunk by the
group in their combined opera-
tions.
This is chicken-feed for any
sizeable oil co., but it represents
quite a heavy outlay of share-
holders’ money for no' tangible-
re tu r n in a region which
thorough testing by a major oil
company indicated to be without
prospect of commercial success.
Lincoln Mills is growing into
a very big concern. It is not so
lopg ago that written-down ord.
capital was only £BO,OOO in 4s.
shares, and there was then
£400,000 of 9 p.c. pref. capital.
When the new issue is fully
paid up the share-register total
will be £1,232,108. Both ords.
and 9 p.c. prefs. participate,
share for share, in the new
issue; but prefs. should not
expect to participate in future
ord. issues, the directors say.
Present participation is appar-
ently a gesture in respect of the
tough old days before the war.
If wool prices fall the co. may
not need all its present capital,
of which £350,000 is in redeem-
able prefs. Last ord. div. was
6i p.c. out of earnings of
26.5 p.q. on ord. capital. Rights
to the new Bs. ords. have been
selling at around 3s. 3d.

With the Auckland harbor
bridge at last in the planning
stage, New Zealand is looking
round for steel for a long list of
construction projects all on the
urgent list, and has sent its
Minister of Supply, Charlie
Bowden, on a buying mission to
Uncle Sam and John Bull. The
threatened crisis has been
hurried along by the shipping
strike, which has been an indus-
trial catastrophe for Maoriland.
Unless a miracle happens, this
year, which opened with a wool
boom, will end with a steel and
metal famine. There’s a 15-year
leeway in commercial and in-
dustrial building to make op,
with probably equal arrears in
national development and muni-
cipal works. Steel supplies this
year aren’t likely to be within
cooee of minimum needs of a
quarter of a million tons.
Engineering and metal firms
from end to end of Maoriland
have been scratching for steel
for a long time, and haven’t
been able to build up stocks.

These figures are based on the
dividends distributable for the year
ended 15th May, 1951. What better
way is there for you to invest those
pounds that are lying idle in the bank,
tied up in property or invested in
securities showing much lower returns
and no capital appreciation.
Investors in the Trust have the added
satisfaction of knowing that their
money is invested in no less than 20
of Australia’s greatest Industrial and

The great attraction of investment in
Unit Trusts, however, is the fact that
it is open to investors in every walk
of life. For instance, approximately
£3O is sufficient to become a fully paid
shareholder in the Unit Trust
although, on the other hand, many
have invested thousands of pounds in
this unique method of making Capital
earn worthwhile dividends.

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY.
Money, Goods and Taxes
When an inflationary windfall,
of external origin, transformed
budgetary conditions for New
Zealand’s Holland Government
in its first year and left it with
a surplus of £8,714,000, three
millions were handed out as a
£5 bonus for every child in
Maoriland and £si million went
to form the nucleus of a war-
emergency reserve, with an ulti-
mate target of £lOO million.
Maorilanders couldn’t find
fault with the modest provision
for future security, and many
welcomed the £5 handout for the
rising generation ; but there were
others who weren’t so sure.
With clothing and nearly
everything else scarce, the extra
millions were just so much more
fuel for the inflationary fires,
and there was no guarantee they
would go to help youngsters,
even if the stuff was there to be
bought. With consumption out-
stripping production all along
the line, the bonus tipped the
balance more in the wrong direc-
tion, and did nothing to reduce
the long list of shortages. Under-
production in Maoriland is
something that won’t be put
right by State opulence or
patrimony, which only en-
courages the diehard feeling
among Maorilanders that “easy
money” might still be the cure
for all their troubles.
One of N.Z.’s leading bankers,
H. W. Whyte, g.-m. of the
National Bank of N.Z., put the
position in a nutshell when he
said; “If we give a man £1 for
lOs.-worth of work, very soon
the £1 will be worth only 10s,
It’s nearly as simple as that.”
His advice to businessmen was
to give a lead by showing they
were prepared to be less selfish,
but altruism will take a lot of
whipping up after years of
pampering.
With tax yields soaring, M.L.’s
greedy tax department doesn’t
set an example in self-denial,
and the Government still en-
courages the idea that it’s a
glorified Santa Claus, all of
which plays havoc with incen-
tives. Maorilanders who pay
taxes with one hand hold out the
other in the hope of getting their
money back, and public finance
in their welfare state, with Social
Security now costing more than
a million a week, is more and
more money-spinning.
A small army of new tax-
payers has sprung up as inflation
has forced lower incomes above
the tax-exemption limit, but they
get back all they pay, and more,
in child benefits, free drugs, free
medical service and whatnot in
their little world of at present
buoyant, but narrowly based,
prosperity. No one knows how
long this can go on, or where the
road is leading them, but
shrewder heads realise the spend-
ing spree can’t last for ever.
When the change comes there
will be shocks for many who
have been leaning on export
prosperity to bolster up their
rather shaky internal economy.
The budgetary windfall is the
forerunner of a still larger one
next year if tax-rates remain near
present levels, for taxation trails
along in the wake of inflation
under M.L.’s system of levying
tax this year on last year’s in-
come. So far the big haul from
the wool boom hasn’t been col-
lected. Without it, income tax
has produced nearly £ll million
more than a year ago to set a
record of £59 million, and total
taxes have jumped to a peak of
£l5B million, against £135 mil-
lion.
While tax revenue is flowing
bank-high, a team of experts is
working behind the scenes to give
the tax system its first full-scale
overhaul since the early
’twenties. As the system bristles
with anomalies, it’s time some-
thing was done.
Newspaper Prices
When the 12-year freeze in
New Zealand newspaper prices
ended, and prices jumped from
2d. to 3d. for regular sub-
scribers) on May 28, Edward
Anderson, chairman of N.Z.
Newspapers, Ltd., said soaring
costs had forced the rise.
Casting a roving eye over the
whole field of costs, he said:
“Any attempt to keep up with
prices such as confront us today
is like ‘trying to draw a gallop-
ing horse’.” In one year English
newsprint had bounded up £3O
to £75 10s. a ton and one
ton was costing as much as five
tons before the war. Canadian
newsprint prices weren’t far be-
hind, and freight-rates from
Canada, at £l3 a ton, were four
times those of before the war.
This was the brief, fleeting
glimpse of costs given to Maori-
landers in a newspaper field
where nearly every journal is in
proprietary hands. Edward
Anderson, who has inherited the
crown worn for 20 years by late
knight Cecil Leys, forecast still
higher costs, after a year of the
sharpest rises ever recorded.
Prices for new plant bought
from John Bull were now
“almost fantastic.”
Companies would have to be
allowed to set aside larger un-
taxed funds to safeguard the
future. This, of course, wasn’t
just the concern of Press pro-
prietors, for every M.L. co. ex-
panding or replacing plant was
in the same boat. “Erosion of
capital” is what it amounts to,
and there’s a lot of it going on
under inflation on both sides of
the Tasman.
Flourmilling
What with the shipping bottle-
neck and the dock strike, New
Zealand flourmills, which grist
Australian wheat, have had up-
hill going for months past, and
at times Maorilanders have had
to go short of bread, while
poultry and other livestock have
been having a lean time. Aus-
tralian flour might help M.L. to
make headway against lack of
shipping, but it would rob M.L.
producers of by-products they
haven’t enough of now, so there’s
no short-cut out of the present
fix.
The chairman of both N.Z.’s
leading flourmilling concerns, in
Auckland, say there’s only one
answer —faster shipments—and
any other move is only a stop-
gap.
John Hellaby, head-serang of
the Northern Roller Milling Co.,
Ltd., told Maorilanders in May
that bran and pollard were as
vital to the survival of the stock
and poultry industries in N.Z.
as in Australia, and anyone who
suggested buying Australian flour
was indulging in pipe-dreams.
What N.Z. needed to “rationalise
the whole flourmilling industry”
was a mill in Wellington to grist
grain from the best available
source, but there’s no sign of
any move yet to plan, let alone
build, a mill there.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"
“B. A. Ker”: I don’t know whether
“Arnold’s Shilling Composition” (B.
9/5/’5l) is still in print, but Pendlebury
and Beard’s “Shilling Arithmetic” is still
going strong —at four and ninepence.
Still, our monetary system may have in-
flated itself nearly 500 p.c. since these
problems were set: “If oranges are sold
at three for a penny, how many could be
bought for £3 16s. 4d.?” “A builder pays
his men in wages: Four carpenters at £1
ss, 9d. each, eight painters at £1 10s.
each, seven bricklayers at £1 6s. lOd.
each, and nine laborers at 19s. 6d. each.”
On the other hand, when P. and B. set
their problems mutton was bringing good
prices; “A farmer sold 76 sheep at £4
16s. lOd. each.” Yet the baker’s bill was
heavier than the butcher’s! “I pay a
butcher £3 10s. 6d., a grocer 15s. 7d.
more than the butcher, and a baker £1
12s, sd, more than the grocer.” At first
glance that looks like flagrant
profiteering, but the baker may
have had to pay his employees
penalty rates owing to black-
outs. They did have labor
troubles in those days: “Three
thousand workmen strike be-
cause an increase of a halfpenny
per hour is not granted; find
the sum, etc.” But this is the
one that really appealed to me:
“A tradesman allows me 17s. off
a bill for £l7 16s. Bd.; how
much do I pay?” Ah, give me
the good old days!

“Fairf”: Everybody must
have heard the joke about the
young ship’s officer who plotted
the vessel’s position on the chart,
showed it to the skipper, and
was gravely requested to
remove his cap as the ship was
in the middle of St. Paul’s
Cathedral. An even more
amazing thing has happened at
my place; I have discovered
that the Equator runs right
through my bathroom between
the corner-basin and the bath.
Thus I clean my teeth in the
northern hemisphere, but cross
the Line to cut my corns. I sleep Down
Under, eat my breakfast egg as a
Northerner, and shave with one foot in
each hemisphere. Of course, a lot of
conservative people will contradict me
and talk learnedly about latitudes and
such pedantic things, but my calcula-
tions have the backing of authority. For
years par.-writers and other knowledgeable
persons have solemnly declared that the
earth’s motion governs water running
down plugholes, compelling it to swirl
clockwise in the southern hemisphere and
anti-clockwise on t’other side of the
Equator; and what right have Ito chal-
lenge science just because my basin- and
bath-waters run in opposite directions?

“Harbel”: A ladies’ auxiliary in our
district organised a jumble stall in the
main street. During the morning a friend
of one of the voluntary workers ran into
a spot of trouble: her dog had followed
her and was likely to sneak on the train
after she’d boarded it. The committee
member offered a practical suggestion ;
tie the dog to the table-leg and pick him
up on the way home. It seemed a flaw-
less arrangement. During the day a fresh
shift of helpers took over, but nobody

thought to mention the tyke. Towards
evening the dog’s owner returned and was
horrified to hear that her pet had been
sold for a pound to a lady unknown.
However, her troubles ended when the
dog came home, but then the buyer sought
out the seller and demanded her pro-
perty. The seller had paid the pound
into the fund and didn’t see how she
could get it back. At the moment a
three-cornered deadlock exists. Perhaps
some local Solomon will fix things up

a tent-pole."
with satisfaction all round, but I fear it
will cost him a quid.

“D. 8.”: Put me down as one who
does not agree with the rest of
“Mullum’s” parachutists (B. 2/5/’5l).
On the only occasion I had to bale-out
I certainly had no sensation of con-
tinuous somersaults —I knew very well
I was lying face-down in the attitude in
which I was being dragged when I broke
the oxygen-pipe which connected me to
the aircraft I’d been following. I had a
perfect view of the portion of the desert
I was about to hit, and the rate at which
the scenery was magnifying conveyed an
entirely adequate sensation of falling. I
could feel the pressure of the wind caused
by my fall, and could feel it become less
as I slowed down from the speed of the
aircraft to that of a falling Homo sapiens
—a maximum of about 150 m.p.h., I be-
lieve. When I felt the pressure constant,
I knew that I was at this terminal velocity
and slow enough to open the parachute.
I had no time to sample the pleasures
of controlled descent as I’d been going
low and fast when I’d stopped one in the
petrol tank. I landed with a bump
almost immediately I pulled the string.
Those suicides would have a painless
descent all right provided they kept their
ears open to equalise the pressure, but
they would see the lot, poor devils.

“Bo”: The piece Yehudi Menuhin
was playing half-way through his first
Sydney recital called for the most
vigorous pizzicato, and it was not exactly
surprising when, under the impact of his
slashing fingers, a string snapped. As the
virtuoso bowed to the applause —whether
the clapping on such occasions is a
tribute to the artist’s digital strength,
encouragement, or just sympathy for
what is no particular predicament always
remains a puzzle—and bore his fiddle
back to the artists’ room the woman in
the platina-foxes in front leaned towards
her companion and said in an anxious
voice raised a bit to get above the
clamor: “My dear, I wonder can he get
it fixed —you know how hard it is to get
a mechanic at this time of night!”

“Becks”: Playing show-poker with
tram-ticket numbers is a mild gamble
frequently indulged in by regular tram-
travellers. On a Sydney ferry-feeder
tram a batch of old hands have been
playing it for years. Each man puts in
his sixpence for a fourpenny fare;
ticket-numbers are compared and the
winner takes the change. The trammie
knows their habit and is used to tearing
off 10 or a dozen tickets for the team.
One night recently he delayed visiting
them until the tram had almost reached
the stop where the first of the party was
to alight. Then, taking the money from
the “cashier,” he thrust a batch of tickets
into his hand. There was a hasty grab-
bing of tickets as three or four players
got out. As the tram moved on, one of
those who had just got off shouted
“Four fours; I’ll pick up the money to-
morrow.” He was last seen in wordy
conference with those who had alighted
with him, but those on board weren’t
interested. Their attention was concen-
trated on their own tickets —an assorted
batch of four fives, four sixes, four sevens
and so on. They’re still arguing who won
the pool, but the bigger problem is how
long it took the trammie to save up those
fours-of-a-kind.
* * * *
“Pumba”: “El Verdugo” on election
eggs (B. 9/5/’5l) seems a bit off
his bearings. He says “I remember
another [meeting] from which I
returned with T. J. Ryan, the
only Australian to hold seats in
two Parliaments At the same time
—Victoria and South Australia.”
Perhaps he will explain how.
And it was not Jack Fihelly
who dared T.J.R. to speak at
his peril; it was Billy Hughes.
T. J. Ryan made some state-
ments in the Queensland Parlia-
ment in 1917 concerning the
conscription issue. “Make those
statements outside the House,”
said Billy, “and I’ll have you.”
Ryan did, in Market-square
(now King George-square), and
was summonsed under the War
Precaution Act, hauled before
the court and found not guilty.
* « ♦
“No Sirrah”: Literary com-
petitions (B. 2/5/’51)? A
regrettable tendency is to offer
first-, second- and third-prize
and then to renege on the first.
The A.B.C. has been guilty
twice. Last year it offered a
prize for the best serial story to
be read over the air each morn-
ing. In fact, it offered three
prizes. When the awards
were announced it was stated
that as none of the stories sub-
mitted was considered worthy of first-
prize only the second-prize was awarded.
Similarly, after offering three prizes for
the best short-stories broadcast in 1950
the A.B.C. claimed that none was worthy
of first-prize.

“C.A.A.”: Strange advertisements (B.

who must also be an electrical engineer
capable of taking over the local municipal
power-plant.

“L.S.M.”: In his love for the provosts
(B. 16/5/’5l) Darky had a mate in a little
Scotch soldier we met in London. We
were walking along the street when three
red-caps approached. Jock immediately
took to his heels and the red-caps followed
in hot pursuit. Jock rejoined us a little
time later, apologised for his hasty de-
parture, and told us he’d “just been
around the block.” He’d barely told us
this much when the red-caps reappeared,
very much out of breath and temper. This
time Jock stood his ground. “So; and
where’s yT leave-pass?” was the curt
greeting. Jock smilingly drew the pass
from his pocket. The leader of the trio
scrutinised it carefully and almost
savagely. “Eh, what’s the meaning of
this?” he growled. “This leave-pass is in
order. What did you run away for?”
Jock looked shocked and hurt. “Run
away?” he said. “Can’t a man go for a
run around the block without you fellers
chasing him?” The red-caps strode off
moodily.

“Orderly - Room”: Wonder if
“Vingter’s” a.w.l. merchant got off as
lightly as the bloke in Redbank who
faced a court-martial in 1942 for being
18 months adrift. Summary of evidence
disclosed a strange story. He had joined
up in 1939 and, after missing the first
draft, struck several weeks’ paper-picking
and spud-barbering. Fed-up with this
he went through, joined a merchantman
and got over to England in time to
engage in Hitler’s war as part of the
Merchant Navy. After Pearl Harbor
he decided that Australia could do with
his services, so he wangled a boat back,
and gave himself up the day his ship
berthed in Brisbane. V.G. discharges
plus a citation for the D.S.M. backed his
story. Sentence of the court: stoppage
of pay for period of absence plus a five-
bob fine. He eventually went to the
islands as a. sergeant and collected an
M.M.
A JUBILEE ODE.
“On Tuesday the Jubilee session of Parliament
opens, and with it the first session of the new
Menzies Government, returned at last with a majority
in both Houses.”
Awake, M olian lyre, of which the poets speak!
I got mine in a pawnshop, years ago,
Abandoned, maybe, by a migrant Greek,
Exchanging Homer and his ships
And even Helen’s lips
For odoriferous pyres of fish and chips ...
Well, anyhow,
I tune the rusty strings,
And stroke their trembling steel,
And try to feel the things
I feel I ought to feel
If I would be
A poet of the Federal Parliamentary Jubilee.

Used up all the obvious rhymes:
Each poetic Miss or Mr.
Saw the future as a “vista”
“Dawning down the years”—all “serried” —
And richly costume-jewelleried,
While we,
Who see the fruit of all their prophecy
Aghast,
Would gladly hock
The present, and redeem the past,
Or vote for putting back the clock.

By Molonglo’s babbling stream
Robert Gordon Menzies sits,
Immersed in the Australian dream,
Racking all his brilliant wits,
Searching his ironic brain
For glowing words that will not sound inane
When, next Tuesday, he will stand,
Heading the victorious band
He led, like Moses, to the Promised Land,
And, with a master’s voice and prophet’s fire,
And various tasteful tropes,
Announce the hopes to which he hopes
We all aspire;
Truly, some Providence has graced
Our festal year.
A voice less clear,
If hardly less sincere,
Which might have led the nation’s
Historic celebrations,
Has been replaced
By that, of all, most qualified to do so,
That of Australia’s oratoric virtuoso.

Down, but not so downcast, quite,

However, the Australian breed
Have things on which they’re all agreed:
Ben Chifley might see eye-to-eye
With Fadden on some choice meat-pie,
And others might agree on risqug

Else may have something in common —•

“What’s that yoii say, O Muse? ... You’re right,
there:
Canberra is the place for dreaming,
But all around extends a nightmare
From which Australia wakes up screaming:
Strikes and shortages and prices,
Commos, blackouts, Persian crisis—
The sanguinest of poets well may doubt
What Bob can find to jubilate about;
Still,'foolishly, perhaps, I shall contrive
To thank my stars because I’m still alive.”

And caught a tram and hurried home to tea.

Costs you nothing
if you don't succeed
If you have ever wanted to be able to play the piano, then here Is your
opportunity to learn quickly by means of a remarkable English System.
You may never have touched a
piano before. It makes no differ-
ence. No matter how little you
may know about music —no
matter if you do not know one
note from another, you can
quickly learn to play by the new
rapid Grapbonote System.
You need no knowledge what-
ever of music or notes in order
to be able to read music by the
Graphonote System and to play it.
If you have already tried to learn
the piano in the ordinary way
with wearisome scales, exercises
and tedious practice the new
Graphonote System will come as
a positive revelation to you.
In England where the Graphonote
System originated, over ten thou-
sand people most of whom
had no previous knowledge of
music have learned to play by
means of this revolutionary system.
NO « DRUDGERY M
The Graphonote System is indeed
revolutionary. In the past it took
years of practice to store the
player’s mind with “mental
pictures” of the notes so that
they could be easily found on the
keyboard. With the Graphonote
System the “mental pictures” of
the notes are already provided.
They are clearly before your
eyes. Years of drudgery are thus
at one stroke eliminated.
PLAY STANDARD MUSIC
The Graphonote System provides
the most rapid and natural method
of mastering ordinary standard
music.
When playing by the Graphonote
System you read from real,
standard “five-line'’ music—the
sort that is recognised by mus-
icians all the world over.
It should not In any way be con-
fused with “patent”, “trick” or
“number” systems or other
similar “dead end” makeshifts.
Those who learn by such systems
never master the standard mus-
ical notation and are lost when
later they are confronted with a
sheet of ordinary musk.
The more you play by the Grapho-
note System, on the other hand,
the more familiar you become
with standard musical notation.
YOU LEARN AT HOME
By the Graphonote System, which
consists of a course of carefully
graded postal lessons, you learn
privately in your own home. It
does not matter where you live,
you can learn anywhere. You
learn in your own time at your
own convenience, without any-
one present to embarrass you.
If you make a slip “Graphonote”
shows you at once where you
are wrong.

“Golden Mile”: Nat Harper may, in
an after-dinner speech in August, 1895,
have ventured the possibility of water
being pumped to the goldfields (B.
25/4/’5l), but nothing can detract from
the genius of the engineer who planned
and built the pipeline Departmental
files, investigated by Professor Murdoch,
at the request of the WA Government,
show that by November, 1895, C. Y.
O’Connor and his staff already had the
preliminary surveys almost completed. It
was O’Connor who, turning down the
sluggish undammable Avon, chose the
adequate Helena River, where a conciete
weir impounds a lake capable of yielding
five million gallons daily to the pipeline.
To carry this five millions a pipe 2ft. 6in.
in diameter was required. A riveted steel
pipe meant too much wastage, and cast-
iron pipes would have trebled the cost.
O’Connor’s choice fell on the locking-bar
pipe, just then invented by Mephan Fer-
guson, of Adelaide. Other things had to
be studied—pumps, for there was a lift of
1290 ft. to Coolgardie; the possible effect
of the fierce goldfields sun on the dry, or
even on the full, pipe ; internal friction ;
corrosion; reservoirs along the route;
“ Ouch! This harp's sharp!"
siphoning over hills and down into
valleys; even the thousand tons of lead
for the caulking. All these things and a
hundred others O’Connor thought of, and
solved. And the 30in, pipe that accom-
panies the traveller from Kalgoorlie
almost to Perth stands as a monument to
the brain that devised it. Any attempt
to transfer the credit elsewhere merely
excites derision among the well-informed.

“Harold Hardupp”: How seven people
in one struggling mass could possibly
fall through a bay-window, even if the
surrounding frame went with them, is
still a mystery to me; but it happened
once in Darlinghurst (N.S.W.). A crowd
attracted me; inside a ground-floor bay-
window that hung over the street a
tangled mass of men were struggling,
grunting and swearing; right on my
arrival there was a rending crash, and
the mass of warring masculinity, with
some pieces of broken timber and much
shattered glass, flopped down on the
crowd and the pavement. By the time
the police and the ambulance arrived we
had got the combatants—seven of them —
to their feet and sorted out. After four
had been sent to hospital one of the
others proclaimed that, as the party there
seemed definitely over, he intended to
throw one at his flat. Somehow I found
myself in it; but I kept well away from
the windows.

“Rooster”: Army mascots (B. 2/5/’51)?
A lop-eared mong which became attached
to us at Kilo 89, Palestine, in 1941, just
refused to stay
behind when we
set off for Africa.
Unloading the
trucks at the first
convoy halt, we
found Caesar
coiled up inside a
copper. He was
about as sorry a
looking specimen
of canine coward-
liness as you’d see
anywhere, but we
didn’t have the heart to kick him out.
I often saw him taking a backward jump
at the sight of his own shadow. Yet, at
the sound of the first “crump” of a bomb
explosion he’d rush out from cover, fangs
bared, hair bristling, with the courage of
a pedigreed bulldog. One got him, in
Tobruk.

“Lord Luvus”: Duet between the care-
taker and the new cleaner, overheard from
behind a partition in my office. New
cleaner; “Look here! I’ve found half
a bottle of sherry in this basket” Care-
taker, in urgent tones; “Don’t drink it;
don’t drink it! You never know what
they may have put in it” By the rustling
of paper the bottle has gone back into
the basket. A few minutes later I see
from my window the caretaker in the lane
emptying the bottle.
* * * *
“Aestur”: A.B.C. announcers aren’t
the only ones who mispronounce place-
names (B. 9/5/’5l). Before I went to
the West I pronounced Albany “Orl-
bany”; but in Perth everyone I met
rhymed the first syllable with “pal.” I
switched. But on the train to Albany a
couple of passengers corrected me again ;
they lived there, and called it “Orlbany”
—only outsiders said “Ah” Yet at
Albany everyone I spoke to rhymed the
first syllable with “pal.” It’s just struck
me: perhaps the couple in the train were
A.B.C. announcers,.
A SAD CASE.
“For Sale: 12-inch lawnmower, 5 cwt. roller.
Owner no further use.” —“8 . M. Herald.”
No self-deceiving, false evaluation
Of his own worth ho fatuously makes,
In case his ego gets acceleration
He herewith ruthlessly applies the brakes,
Fit only now, he knows —than he none better —
To get into a wheel-chair or divan.
A motor he, without a carburettor;
A has-been and a virtual dead-letter,
A scrapheap man.
He’d searched his soul, of that you may be
certain,
And so by what he saw he was convinced
Life must be shortly ringing down the curtain,
That he was just about washed out —and
rinsed.
There’s no suggestion of apologising,
No hint therein he gave himself the lash.
His statement’s bold, frankly uncompromising.
It’s simply that this fact he’s advertising—
He’s done his dashl
Most men, it must he stated in all fairness,
Whether they push a pen or dig up spuds,
Inevitably would, with the awareness
' That they’d degenerated into duds,
Be seized with quite determined inclination
To keep the knowledge underneath their lids.
But he embraces no such reservation.
In fact, he makes it quite a proclamation
He’s on the skids.
How came he, think you, to the knowledge
dismal —
The pass to which we all must come at last;
The final truth, so naked, so abysmal—
That any usefulness he’d had was past?
Did someone whom he’d greatly aggravated
Tell him so brutally, scotching all doubt
That on him mental rust accumulated,
And that he should be superannuated,
Pushed up the spout?
Or was it that eventual conviction
That he to any more utility
Had become overripe for valediction
Came from the bosom of his family?
That’s where the real home-truth would get an
airing.
* IPs more than possible that, getting mad
Because he was reluctant to be tearing
Into the lawns, his missus, long despairing.
Put in that ad.

ABORIGINALITIES
V.”: About 12 months ago I joined
forces with Dad Woolly on his small
sheepfarm. It was crutching-time then,
and each day began and ended with the
daylight, while Saturday afternoons and
Sundays were used to muster and draft.
A number of the animals were bottle-
jawed, and no sooner was crutching
finished than Dad ordered them all to
be mustered again and dosed for fluke.
We’d just finished that when the footrot
started. Through the wet weeks we
toiled, mixing footbaths and painting
hoofs, till the old bloke called a halt so
that we could inoculate for pulpy
kidney before lambing. Lambing lasted
six weeks, and meant two daily trips
round the ewes—trips that started in the
frosty dawn and ended in moonlight.
Marking followed on'the heels of lamb-
ing, then more inoculating, and as I
finished the last needleful the old man
mentioned that the flies were starting and
we’d have to watch out or we’d be in
trouble. We watched out; and we were
in trouble. A number of sheep were
found cast soon after that, and as shear-
ing approached it became a daily contest
beating the crows to helpless full-
wooiled animals whose fleece had spread.
Then came shearing, branding and dip-
ping in weary procession, till the whole
world reeked of sheep. Dipping was
followed by a very necessary inoculation
against black disease for the entire
flock, and after that more drafting of
infected animals and‘treatment for pink-
eye. Talk about graft! At present we
are round again to one of the periodic
doses for worms, and I dragged in the
other night from a long day’s mustering
in hilly scrub, picked up my Bulletin
of 9/5/’5l, and on easy occupations
read: “Wool grows with little trouble to
anyone except the sheep.”
* * * *
“Harbel”: At first glance I thought the
inhabitant who sat alongside me on the
form outside the rural store was a very
fat man. His jowls bulged and his cheeks
seemed to be pushing his eyes back out
of sight. The fingers that lit the cigarette
were podgy, yet his body was not over-
weight. He volunteered: “Bees —they
hate me.” I mumbled something sympa-
thetically inane and he*went on: “A
year or so ago a swarm started poking
around a hole in the weatherboards at
the Old Lady’s place. The blacksmith
told her he
wanted ’em and
he’d come up an
get ’em. Any-
how, he never
come and they
got established in
between the
we a th erboards
and the lining. The Old Lady got
frightened about ’em and kept harpin’ at
me to get rid of ’em. I told her I
couldn’t —bees don’t tike me ; even when
I was goin’ to school they’d fly around
other kids to get at me. But I finished
up by pouring a few grogs into the
Wackie and gettin’ him to come up. Well,
fair dinkum! He levered the board out,
pulled out the hive —and didn’t get a
sting. Then his ladder started to slip. I
rushed forward to ‘foot’ it —and look
what they did! There must be something
about the smell of me they don’t like.”
A wild, hunted look had come to the
speaker’s eyes ; he was staring across my
right shoulder. Suddenly he sprang up
and back off. It was too late.
A bee buzzed past my ear, shot straight
ahead to the gleaming target and sat
down squarely on the tortured nose.
* * * *
“Pip Tok”: Two giant pear-trees,
planted by convicts in the early days in
the Hannup district of Westralia’s fruit-
growing south-west, have become casu-
alties in the State’s war against codlin-
moth. When felled by order of the Agri-
cultural Department’s experts it was
found that one tree, more than 50ft. high,
carried a crop of about 70 bushels —
about a ton and a half in weight.
Another, 45ft. high, had a girth of
6ft. 6in. at 3ft. above ground-level.
“ That’s right , boy—keep your head down and concentrate!”
“Dick Turpin”: I had just turned 13
when I received my first muzzle-loader
(B. 16/5/’5l) —a long-barrelled single
made by I. H. Timmins and Sons of
London, who went out of business a
century ago. My father bought it for
me less than 20 years ago from an old
Bathurst (N.S.W.) gunsmith for 10s. with
powder, shot, caps and a shot-flask
thrown in. We tied it to a fence and
shot off a triple-load of powder as a
safety-test, and then went to work on
the ducks along the Bogan. It was cheap
if somewhat slow shooting, even in days
when 1 12-gauge cartridges were readily
available at 4s. 6d. a box. And, although
I have shot out of expensive breech-
loaders since, I’ve never quite regained
the same thrill: the cannon-like detona-
tion, the flash anti the cloud of smoke
that usually disclosed a dead duck when
it rolled away. Somehow the old gun
was lost while I was away during the
war, but I still have the shot-flask and
a tin of the old serrated caps.
* * * ♦
“The Bunyip”; Don’t know anything
more maddening that being cornered by
an old cricketer who insists on recounting
without pause all his past performances
while you’re bursting to tell him about
your own. Our valley once sent a great
all-rounder with the Australian Eleven
to England, but he should never have
been selected —that is, not in preference
to the various old codgers who have
survived him and who always got him
out cheaply after defying all his efforts
to shift them. As the years pass
and his records inevitably are
eclipsed, some of his remaining
rivals have grown almost kindly
in their tales of how they had
the champ, in their pockets. Old
Syd is the worst. “We were
playing the Big Feller once,”
he’ll drawl (the Big Feller,
despite his weaknesses, is still
habitually remembered as a
team in himself). “He’d made
a hundred the week before, and
this day I was bowlin’ when
he came in. First ball I sends
him down a ‘windjammer’ and
it whizzes past his off stump—
he never saw it. Next ball I
whips in a ‘whirligig’ and over
goes his middle peg.” Heavy
pause, then up pipes the only
listener who hadn’t heard the
story before. “What was the difference
between the two balls, Syd?” The old
coot chortles to himself. “That’s where
I tricked him, boy. There weren’t no
difference! ”
* * * ♦
“Old-timer”: “This here ‘Man from
Snowy River,’ ” said Little Curl, looking
up from the book, “reminds me of the
time me an’ Nazzy Casey was pushin’ a
mob o’ steers along the Noo South side
<o one o’ Pegler’s stations near Mildoora.
It was before they built the bridge, an’
we camped ’em down opposite the
punt an’ then took our horses over
an’ rode inter the town, stablin’
the prads at George Rodda’s livery-
stable. About ten o’clock that night
I’m with a coupler blokes an’
two or three flagons in Deakin-avenue
when a kid comes up on a bike an’ says
‘Nazzy Casey’s lookin’ for you. Them
steers have broke out an’ headed for
Broken Hill or somewhere, an’ he says
y’ got t’ catch him up an’ get after ’em.’
Well, I scarper down t’ Rodda’s an’ grab
me prad an’ head for the punt, the river
bein’ too wide t’ swim it. It’s pretty
dark an’ I’m pretty full, an’ when we get
to the punt it’s on the other side an’ I
got t’ wait till it comes across, which
all takes time. We get across after a bit
an’ I climb on the prad an’ hit out for
the camp. There ain’t a steer or anythin’
in sight, but I can hear a lot o’ yellin’ up
north an’ head for it, an’ when I get
there it’s Nazzy an’ the steers an’ we
round ’em up an’ get ’em back.” Little
Curl fell silent. “Well,” demanded Big
Fleming, “what’s that got t’ do with the
man from Snowy River?” “Him!”
snorted Curl. “Canterin’ about on them
hills after a few neddies in broad day-
light. Nazzy chased them steers in the
middle of the night through flooded box-
“Anyone else think it’s a fake?”
swamps an’ lignum an’ had ’em all when
I got there. But nobody wrote no pomes
about it.”

“Billy T.”: That touchy visitor who
wails that tea is not brewed here the way
it is in the land where it is grown (B.
16/5/’5l) is quite right: and a good job,
too. No “char-wallah” X ever patronised
could give me a cupper anything like
the one I make first thing in the mom-
jn SJ one of the reasons being that in the
land of the Sacred Cow I never saw good
milk. Worst cup I ever drank —in
Bengal, admittedly, and not Ceylon—was
at a roadside-stall while waiting for a
lift down the Arakan. The little kettle
boiled gently on the dung-fire, and when
I called for succor—it is only by tea in
any form that you kept going through
those days—he lifted the lid, dropped in
a pinch of fresh (?) tea and let it stew
a lew minutes. Then into my cup, newly-
wiped bn his dhoti, he splashed a few
drops of what looked like chalk and
water, and filled it with poison from the
kettle. I drank it, and, being satisfied
long before that the fates were going to
let me outlive the war, handed back the
cup for a refill. This poured, he knocked
the leaves from the strainer back into
the kettle, and retired to a comer like a
spider awaiting its next victim. Of course
our visitor apparently had tasted Aus-
tralian tea in pubs only. If he could
climb off his pedestal and go stocking
hay long enough to get himself soaked in
sweat on a windless Riverina day, he’d
know what good tea tasted like when
Mum came down the paddock ; or, if he
asked humbly, I could take him to some
little cold Gippsland creeks whose soft,
sweet water makes a celestial brew to
which my nostalgic pen-name stands
tribute. But I’m afraid neither sugges-
tion would be accepted, for such fellows
believe and say only what they want to —
like the types who judge England by the
Oliviers and America by the Andrews
Sisters.

“Mat’s Mate”: When “K.A.” stays at
a pub and the girl does his room out
where does she put his pyjamas? Well,
thafs where she’d put Mat’s (B. 9/5/’5l),
and when the publican and I shifted his
things we overlooked them, that’s all.
* * * *
“Mac Fergus”: On the footpath out-
side the pub a minstrel, not with a wild
harp, but with a wheezy “pianner
accordeen” slung around him, squeezed
out “Galway Bay.” The publican
beckoned a customer, by chance a Scot,
across t o
the counter,
and, fling-
ing down
a florin,
said “Give
that to the
mu sician.
It does me
heart good
to hear that
beautiful melody,” Outside the Scot
handed the two-bob over with the request
“Gie us Loch Lomond and a shillin’
change.” When the strains of the
Scottish air penetrated Bung’s understand-
ing he vaulted the counter, bounded to
the door and shouted “Play it in swing-
time if you must play that rubbish! ” It
was sacrilege. Immediately I withdrew
my patronage, went across to the pub
opposite and blew in the bob change.
* * * *
“Orang Putch” (Siam): For deep-
diving without equipment I nominate this
as a good effort. Last month, while
boring for tin from a pontoon off the
island of Puket on the west coast of
Siam, we lost 60ft. of steel boring-pipes
in 70ft. of water. The chances of re-
covering them seemed fairly remote.
However, we engaged two local divers,
“orang laouts” (men of the sea), a race
of people of Malayan descent who in-
habit the coastal strips on both coasts of
the Malay Peninsula. These people
practically live in their self-built boats
and are almost solely engaged
in fishing. The two divers,
whose only apparent equipment
was a pair of home-made
goggles, with wooden frames,
measured the depth, shook their
heads, but decided “to give it a
go.” The position was made
more difficult by the fact that
the boring pontoon was moored
immediately above where the
pipes were presumed to have
fallen ; it was not therefore pos-
sible for the divers to stand off
and dive and then swim down.
They were obliged to go down
almost perpendicularly. They
located the pipes at the first dive.
Because of the weight of the
pipes (around scwt.) two strong
ropes had to be fastened around
them. This necessitated five or
six dives, occupying perhaps half an hour;
when the ropes were firmly tied the pipes,
in one length of 60ft., were hauled up.
The pipes were lying on a sandy bottom.
How the divers managed to gpt two ropes
round them, when the pipes were far too
heavy for them to lift, to slip the rope
under, is beyond me. The depth was
measured by the divers themselves, by the
man in charge of the boring, and finally
checked by me with the sounding-line.
CONDOB'LIN WAY.
Down the winding Lachlan
Lies old Condob’lin town,
Oft our jlhoughts will travel
Roads all warm and brown.
Golden wheat at noontide,
Wool-bales all away,
Black swans flying homeward;
Out west, Condob’Hn way.
Rain along the river,
Birds at Micabil weir,
Box-trees in the sunlight,
Wilgas everywhere.
Dreaming by the firelight
After close of day,
Time will always take us
Out west, Condob’lin way.

“H.C.8.”: “Don’t play cards with
strangers” is good advice, even if there
is no money involved. A friendly game
of five-hundred can play havoc with your
reputation for intelligence if you don’t
happen to know the weird signs and
symbols practised around that particular
homestead. I once got myself severely
reprimanded through going eight hearts
when my partner had bid seven. “You
ought to’ve known I was only kickin’
’em up,” he growled at the inevitable
post-mortem. “But how was Ito know?”
I protested. “How?” came the bitter
response. “When you see a man look
disgusted and shut his hand up after
makin’ his call, y’ ought to know he
don’t want to go ’em.” Fellows who “call
the ace” or “go ‘no trumps’ so’s you
know where the joker is” are easy enough
to partner if they tell you their game—
and stick to it. Most of them either
forget to explain it beforehand or only
carry it out when they think of it. But
I never lived down my reputation for
stupidity on one job. I’d gone “Seven
hearts,” played out trumps until the
opposition was skinned of ’em, and, as
the joker hadn’t fallen, knew my partner
would take the last trick. He didn’t.
We “went up,” I held that post-mortem
—where was the joker? One of the
opponents turned over the kitty. The
next second all three were roaring with
laughter about the “dill throwing out
the joker.” I suppose I should haye
known that there is no four of spades in
a pack for a four-handed game, but it’s
not a bad idea to tell a new bloke when
it is being used as a substitute for a lost
joker.
* * * *
“Mat’s Mate”: We were a half-hour
ahead of the train at Ouyen and put it
in at one of the pubs, lazily absorbing
“Washing-board? No fear—gottit Washing-machine."
beer and spinning a slow yarn or two.
Our imminent departure for the big city
reminded Mat of our previous sojourn
there, and he said “You remember that
bloke Shaddock we struck in the Royal
Mail that afternoon?” “Too right,” I
said. “We was lucky we didn’t get
pinched. Never saw a bloke get so
riotous on a few drinks.” “Yair,” Mat
said. “He kicked up a row all right.
Gettin’ him home was no picnic, either.”
“I often wondered,” I said, “why you
was so anxious t’ get him home.” “Aw,
I dunno,” Mat confessed. “Forget now;
probably thought somebody ought t’ do
it. When we got there his missus was
waitin’.” I slowly downed my drink.
“Oh,” I said, without much interest,
“what did she say?” Mat looked at the
clock behind the bar. “Twenty minutes
t’ train-time,” he said. “We’djuiss it if
I was t’ tell y’ what she said.”
* * * *
“Kelms”: Speaking of eels (B. 9/5/’5l).
Many of the North Westralian ‘ rivers
become chains of pools during the rainless
season. Then any black worth his salt
can get a meal by simply digging in the
dry bed of the river and dragging out a
couple of feet of succulent yellow-eel.
Apparently they hibernate in the mud,
and the natives know where to locate
them. Don’t ask me how they tell. To
my eyes there wasn’t a mark on the river-
bed to show where the fish was.
* * * *
“M.S.”: The New Australian had no
trouble getting along with the locals;
his only trouble was getting along with
their language. In the store Hec was
giving him some advice. “Y’ always
want t’ stand up f’r y’rself,” he told him.
“Make it plain, see? Don’t let nobody
take y’ for a woolly.” “A woolly?” The
new bloke looked blank. “Sure, a
woolly,” boomed Hec. “Gripes, don’t y*
know what a woolly is? Well, a woolly’s
a soda.” He
turned away to
order his stores,
and left his
companion
thinking it over.
Presently there
came a touch
on Hec’s arm
and a query.
“What’s a
soda?” repeated the big bloke. “Why, a
soda’s a woolly, o’ course. I mean,
it’s Well, he’s a wonk.” The bloke
looked more confused than before.
“What, don’t you know what a wonk is
either?” Hec scowled at him. “Well,
look here, it’s a ... a dill, see? A sort
of a mug. You know what that is, don't
you? Eh? No, it ain’t got a ’andle.
Good Lord, you’d think they’d give youse
coves a decent language test before they
let y’ loose out ’ere.”
* ♦ • *
“Solitude”: One way and another,
Seventyfiver had been of considerable
assistance to the land-surveyors while
they were in the district, and when they
left they gave him a small pocket-
compass. At first the old bloke couldn’t
see how such a thing could ever be any
use to anybody, but when he eventually
got the hang of it he was constantly taking
it from his pocket, turning himself in
all directions, and chuckling at nothing.
It was in his vest the day we mustered
the steers, and old Punch put his hoof
in a rabbit-hole. The hole was deep,
and as the horse came down he Catherine-
wheeled Seventyfiver into a mess of fallen
timber. The old bloke crawled out,
inspected the nag’s legs, then gingerly felt
his own ribs. “Silly useless cow! Y’
didn’t ought t’ go an’ do a thing like
that,” he growled. “Might easy ’a’ busted
a bloke’s girth.” The incident put him
off his new toy till the following morning,
when I spotted him again consulting it,
and turning sideways in his saddle. “If
you want to know where we’re heading,”
I sniffed, “it’s due north.” “No, it ain’t
then, Sol,” he replied triumphantly. “And
y’ might’nt ’ve noticed lately, but y’d be
s’prised how far round the sun goes,
cornin’ on winter. Take this mornin’
now; he’s gettin’ up dead south-west.”
THE RIVER.
Once it was always summer, when we ran
Over white and burning sands to the green-silk
river,
Plunged in its cool delight and dreaming lay
Locked in the arms o£ that great impersonal
lover.
Under great broken cliffs, and by green flats
Where willows knelt to wash their streaming
hair
We swam, or under tall gum-trees that scattered
Bees, nectar and blossom on the vibrating air.
Where the backwaters, red with floating duck-
Where the hot sandhills, fiery-orange glowing,
And where the twisted lignum swamps slipped
past us
We pushed our boat against the water s
flowing;
Fished under fretted banks, tied to a stump
Of fallen tree; or, beached beneath the shade
Of native willow and coolibah, we left
Fishing to the birds, watching a heron wade
With delicate high-stepping legs; or a white
crane
Moulded in marble, poised on a jutting bank,
Stand silent till the slowly-flowing river
Smoothed to a silver mirror when the sun sank.
And when the full moon rose above the reach
We dived below that sparkling floor of light,
And swam along the moon’s white pathway,
deep
In the cool arms of water and the night.

THE PERSIAN CLASH.
In practically all British Press
comment on the Persian dispute
there has been a sense of danger,
but at the same time an aware-
ness that the issue was a vital
one for Britain—a strikingly
different approach from that to
the Far East issue.
London “Daily Mail” has,
however, been one of the very
few papers to rise to an anger
that would once have been
general. “Persia,” it said
savagely, “has improved on the
game of twisting the British
Lion’s tail. She has punched
him on the nose, and the mangy
old animal does nothing except
grin foolishly and invite another
swipe from someone else.”
“Manchester Guardian”
pointed to a certain glass-
house element in the Lion’s
domicile: “With our own pre-
cedents for nationalisation, we
cannot object to a friendly Gov-
ernment’s desire to nationalise
its oil industry just because we
happen to have an important
stake in it; that kind of short-
sightedness would do irre-
parable harm to our prestige in
the Middle East and lay us open
to the charge of having one set
of principles for ourselves and
another for those whose assets
we ‘exploit,’ ”
The “Observer,” for its part,
put the blame on the oil com-
pany: “Recent offers and
rumors of offers by the com-
pany,” it commented, “strongly
suggest that they have been
willing, at this late hour, to make
financial concessions, and some
managerial compromise. Yet,
before the present violent agita-
tion began, it was the company’s
claim that their offer, embodied
in the supplementary oil agree-
ment of 1948, was the maximum
which was economically feasible
if Persian oil was to remain on
the world market. However
desperate the situation may be
n Persia, it is not too late to
ipply the bitter lesson we are
learning there to the oilfields of
discontented Irak.”
Makipg a leading feature of
the dispute in several issues, the
very ably written London
“Economist” put special
emphasis on the personal
element —the character of the
Persian Prime Minister with
whom Britain has had to deal;
a much more important element
than is often noted.
“Dr. Mohammed Mossadegh,”
it recorded, “is a rich, educated
landowner, over 70 years old,
who has devoted himself to the
organisation of a party whose
sole aim is to ‘nationalise’ or
rather expropriate the Anglo-
Iranian Oil Company. In his
deep and bitter dislike of
foreigners he has convinced
himself that the miserable
poverty of millions of Persians
is entirely due to the fact that
their only large industry is in
the hands of foreigners.
Naturally such a theme, coupled
with the promise of riches for
all Persians as soon as the
‘wicked foreigners’ have been
expelled and Dr. Mossadegh’s
plan has been realised, finds
enormous support among the
illiterates of Tehran. He admits
that “his policy is, at least for
the moment, exactly the same as
that of the Communist (Tudeh)
party; he even acknowledges
that his extreme Right-wing
nationalism is helping the Com-
munists. He claims, however, to
believe that when he has pushed
the British Lion out of Southern
Persia he will be able to escape
from the mouth of the Russian
Bear in the north.”
Stating also that “in his
maddest moments” Dr. Mos-
sadegh “would be willing to see
the petroleum run from the wells
info the sea if he could rid Persia
London “Daily Express."
THERE’S A LITTLE WAITING-LIST AROUND THE CORNER.
of the British,” the “Economist”
summed-up:
“The fact has to be faced that
‘nationalisation’ means, as at
presen]: stated, nothing more or
less than expropriation—that is
to say, seizure of an enterprise
in which over £350 million of
British capital has been sunk.
Yet it is absolutely certain that
the Persian Government could
not run the enterprise without
extensive foreign help. If it
were to persist in its aim, it
would be the end not only of
the oil company but of the
Persian economy; for it is clear
that not for decades would
Persians be able to operate a
concern of the magnitude and
international ramifications of
this gigantic oil-extracting,
-refining and -marketing
organisation. And without the
already great, but potentially
even larger, revenue it draws
from Anglo-Iranian, the Persian
Government would be without a
regular reliable income. In-
ternal collapse would be
dangerous in any country ; how
much more far-reaching would
the results be for a country
which is next-door neighbor to
a great Power whose shortage of
oil is one of its chief economic
weaknesses—the Soviet Union.”
Anti-American comment has
seen the necessary foreign help
coming from American tech-
nicians, as to which the “Wash-
ington Post” has commented
that the Persians “seem to think
that all they have to do is to
throw out the British technicians
and then recruit others, perhaps
Americans, It is not so easy.
Technicians are impossible
nowadays to recruit,” it said.
“They are not easy to recruit
here at home, as any domestic
concern will tell the Iranians.”
On the wider issue of British-
U.S. relations, London
“Economist,” declaring
emphatically that “Persian oil
is absolutely vital to Britain,”
added that “if it has to be said
that the Americans have deserted
the British in the first real test of
their relationship in the Middle
East, then the North Atlantic
alliance will have suffered a
blow from which it might never
'recover.
“The whole structure of
Western policy is crucially at
stake in Persia,” it further
emphasised. “The present crisis
may or may not be due in part
to past mistakes of British policy
—but certainly no more so than
the Korean crisis was due to
past mistakes of American
policy. It is imperative that
America, like Britain, should
back up its partner with full
loyalty in action, however many
doubts and hesitations may be
felt and publicly expressed.
Washington should realise that
this is a test of the partnership
that is likely to be decisive and
cannot be evaded.”
An Edinburgh “Scotsman” cor-
respondent drew attention to a
clause of the Persian-Russian
Treaty which reads:
“If a third party should try to
carry out a policy of usurpation
by armed intervention or if
such a Power should desire to
use Persian territory as a base
of operations against Russia
and if the Persian Government
should not be able to put a stop
to such menace after having
been once called upon to do so
by Russia, Russia shall have the
right to advance her troops into
the Persian interior to carry out
the military operations necessary
for its defence.”
“In terms of Power-politics,”
commented the “Scotsman” cor-
respondent, “that is the simplest
argument against actual physical
British intervention.” Evidently
it would enable Russia to inter-
vene without being open to a
charge of aggression.
Among suggested ways out,
Anthony Eden has proposed a
rising scale of oil royalties
linked with a definite pro-
gramme of social improvement,
while the “Economist” has ad-
vocated payment in oil for
British holdings on a long-term
basis, permitting a transitional
period before liquidation of the
Anglo-Iranian Company.
As to the future, London
“Express” holds that Britain
“cannot survive as the leader of
an independent Empire without
oil from Abadan,” and the
London “ Sunday Times’ ”
financial editor, envisaging a
complete breach between Persia
and the West, has summed-up:
“The loss of Persia’s crude
oil would be bad enough, but
if we were unable to draw re-
fined oil from Abadan, the im-
mediate results would be still
more serious. Already the
world’s refineries are fully
stretched, and the disappearance
of 25 million tons of annual re-
finery capacity would be
disastrous. Such a calamity
would not only mean the re-
imposition of drastic petrol-
rationing in this and other
countries, but it would affect the
supply of fuel oil for ships and
diesel road and rail engines.
Last but not least it would place
our [Britain’s] rearmament pro-
gramme in jeopardy.”
All of which, and more,
would, of course, go for Aus-
tralia as well as Britain.
Britain’s Festival.
As it strikes an American
observer, the “New York
Times’s” able woman cor-
respondent, Anne O’Hare
McCormick:
“The British are seeking relief
from gloom and fear in deter-
mined and, they hope, profitable
entertainment, and they are
quite right in thinking that of
all scarce commodities none is
in such demand today as cheer-
fulness-.
“Beyond that they are trying
to recreate for themselves the
spirit of Merrie England. The
British Festival is not so much
for visitors as for the British.
After years of drab austerity
they want to be reminded of the
glories and beauties of England,
spread over the land in a tapestry
of villages, cathedrals, castles,
customs, traditions and local arts
that are as familiar as home to
all who speak the English
tongue. Against the threats of
the future and the knowledge that
the ancient sceptre is passing
into more awkward hands, they
want reassurance that the island
fortress is strong enough to
endure.”

Jap Rearmament. —Figures of a poll
among Tokyo University students on
Jap rearmament (as reported by Lon-
don "Economist”): 61 per cent, in
favor, 34 per cent, “doubtful,” 5 per

Czech Purges. —That everything in
the satellite garden isn’t as lovely as
Moscow might wish is indicated by
such signs as the official announce-
ment (by secretary-general Slansky)
that some 150,000 members of the
Czech Communist party were expelled
during the recent purge. It brought
the total (by the London “Times”
Vienna correspondent’s computation)
up to 500,000 expelled in the last
three years.

Confident Hong Kong. —Ridiculing
pessimistic reports by various visiting
correspondents, a London “Financial
Times” writer declares that the chief
worry in Hong Kong is that the
Colony may become a pawn at the
conference table. “There is more
fear of that than there is of an armed
invasion, of which local people can
see no evidence.”

U.S. Press Records. —Despite what
opposition there may be in radio and
the television boom, “New York
Times” reports: “The daily news-
papers in the U.S. —there are 1772
of them, 322 morning, 1450 evening—
have a combined circulation of nearly
54,000,000, larger than ever before in
American history. The 549 Sunday
papers have another 46,580,000 —also
a record.”

Made in Germany . “Manchester
Guardian” financial editor’s comment:
“As Britain and the United States
turn over increasingly to defence
work they will have to neglect some
of their export markets. This is ex-
pected to provide growing oppor-
tunities for German exports,”
* * * *
World Record Vote? —In the recent
Jap local-government elections 90 per
cent, of the electorate, men and
women, went to the polls. “This,”
commented “Manchester Guardian,”
“has been described as a record in
Japan, but is it not a world record
for all local-government elections in
which voting is not compulsory, by
law or in effect? Norway prides itself
on the civic sense of its people, but
their highest turnout in local elections
(in 1947) gave a poll of no more than
71.6 per cent.”

U.S. Middle East Errors. —Deplor-
ing the prospect of America hesitat-
ing to support Britain in the Middle
East because of dissatisfaction “with
the nature and degree of assistance”
in the Far East, London “Econo-
mist” (not unfriendly to the U.S.)
frankly criticises: “It is doubtful
whether the real makers of American
policy—Mr. Truman, Mr, Acheson,
Mr. Marshall —have ever had occa-
sion' to think at all deeply about the
Middle East, except in connection
with Palestine. It is virtually certain
that they do not realise how much
mischief American policy has done
in that area, never willing to take
responsibility itself, but equally un-
ready to give any help to those who
do bear the responsibilities of the
Western world in that crucial area.”


GOODYEAR
TYRES
HAVE CHANGED
TOO!
In the development of motor trans-
portation, tyres have played an
important part and none more
than Goodyear Tyres. Out of Goodyear’s unparalleled
experience in building tyres have come many historic
improvements resulting in greater tyre safety, longer
mileage and comfort. Goodyear Tyres today are dramatic
evidence of Goodyear’s ability to give you the finest tyres
it is possible to build.
Again in 1951 ... as in every year for the last 36
years, more people, the world over, ride on Goodyear
Tyres than on any other make.

BETTY MARTYN.
The Surrealist Artist Clears
Things Up.
“Now, Mr. Battye, there are
several points about your most
recent painting, ‘Moonlight Over
a Bulb Plant,” which the public
seems to have difficulty about in
reconciling with the title, and we
hoped an elucidation from you
would put them on the right
track. First, would you explain
the particular significance of the
cat’s entrails draped over half a
violoncello in the right fore-
ground?”
“Perfectly clear, as anyone
with true artistic insight could
have divined. It represents the
positive reaction of Theseus to
the love for him confessed by
Hippolyta.”
“And the bag of blood-and-
bone supporting the cross-
section of a cistern showing the
ball and chain?”
“Of what else could that pos-
sibly be symbolical, my dear sir,
but the tremendous cataclysmic
upheaval attendant upon earth’s
creation? This, of course, has
a direct bearing on the Theseus-
Hippolyta motif by virtue of
their common influence on cer-
tain aspects of post-vorticism
which, in turn, govern, to a great
extent, the principles on which
my own medium is based.”
“There is also the puce hippo-
gryph in zippered boots mounted
on half a scooter and holding
“American. I got ’em on the blackmarket.”
above its head an open umbrella-
frame which has serrated ribs.
This definitely has some pro-
found meaning in the scheme of
things?”
“Naturally, or it would not
have been given its place. It
typifies with the greatest clarity,
if I may say so, the emotional
upsurge which is engendered by
the artist’s own ego.”
“And what about the depiction
of the cadmium-tinted rain
falling horizontally?”
“Nothing could be plainer to
the intelligent observer. It ■
symbolises the eternal struggle
between the forces of Philis-
tinian darkness and the fearless
searchers after truth in Art as
exemplified by modernists who
carry the sword against re-
actionary Objectivism.”
“There is also prominently on
the left foreground an elephan-
tiasis-stricken figure with a
medical mask over its face bend-
ing over an operating-table and
boring into a recumbent figure
with an enormous corkscrew.
What particular bearing has that
on the overall conception of
your picture?”
“An extremely important one.
Without it, how could I possibly
have portrayed the eternal
miracle of the sap rising in all
plant-fife during the vernal
season?”
“And the grinning skull hold-
ing between its greatly-distended
jaws an anti-aircraft shell
painted like a barber’s pole —
that represents, I suppose, the
awakening of innocent love?”
“That piece of symbolism
should have been obvious to a
child. It is as perfect an example
as could have been devised : the
spiritual antagonism that must
ever exist between the mineral
and vegetable kingdoms.”
“And what about the diver’s
boot ou! of which is growing a
horribly deformed human arm in
the middle-distance —no doubt
that is symbolical of Jovian
thunderbolts being hurled from
Olympus?”
“Now that is very good per-
ception. Of course it is! No
really sane viewer could put any
other interpretation on it”
“Well, Mr. Battye, you have
been very helpful. Oh, there is
one other thing. The Prussian-
blue telegraph-pole with bright
orange feathers, huge claws and
an opera-hat perched on the top
of it. That, no doubt, has some-
thing to do with communica-
tions, so vital a feature of this
modern age?”
“Nonsense! To the true sur-
realist mind, which draws its
best inspiration from the visions
that come to it after a midnight
repast of beer, tripe and garlic,
that can conjure up no other
mental picture than that of bene-
ficent Nature showering her
bounty on grateful mankind.”
“Well, thank you, Mr. Battye,
for your co-operation. I’m
afraid, though, that despite your
explanations, the public which
attend your exhibition will still
be puzzled to find the connection
between the crowded symbolism
of your canvas —the concentric
circles, the feline interior decora-
tions, the puce hippogryph in
zippered boots and the rest —
and a title which might reason-
ably be presumed to have some-
thing to do with tulips or daffo-
dils or some other bulbular
plant.”
“What on earth are you nat-
tering about? Who said my
painting had anything to do with
a garden? No wonder art-
lovers have been puzzled! It is
all a misconception by them.
The title of my painting clearly
reflects the contents of it —that
is, the lunar effect on an electric-
light-globe factory!”
Bo.
No Intention to Strike.
“Mr. I. L. Higgins, for the prose-
cution, told the court that when an
under-manager and a deputy were
talking to Treglown he started to
scratch his head, and as he did so a
box of matches fell from under his
pit-helmet.”
The man who earns his bread in
mines
With equanimity resigns
Himself to quite a host of rules
About his working clothes and
tools
And oddments he may cany
round
Whenever he goes underground,
For such things would involve
the fates,
It’s plain, of him and all his
mates.
So when the matches close con-
cealed
Beneath his helmet are revealed.
Against all mining regulations
There’s little use of protesta-
tions ;
His only suitable defence
Would be to make a bold pre-
tence
That, far from wanting smokers’
pleasures,
He took them down as safety
measures.

What was the Vichy Government ?
The emergency Government set up
at the famous health resort, Vichy,
in France after the defeat of that
nation by Germany during World
War II (June, 1940). It was headed
by Marshal Petain, and dictatorial
powers were granted its members. The
Vichy Government was accused of
“collaborating” with, and giving aid
in the form of men and weapons to,
the German Government during the
later years of the war.

Where is Radio City?
It is the popular designation of
Rockefeller Center, a group of build-
ings in New York City specially de-
signed to house the city’s leading
commercial enterprises, built between
1931 and 1940. The term is derived
from the R.C.A. (Radio Corporation
of America) Building, which is the
centre of the group and contains the
studios of the National Broadcasting
Company. A sunken plaza, land-
scaped gardens, outdoor sculpture,
shops, restaurants and two theatres
are included in the group.

(1) At what age should pups be
weaned and what food should be
given during the weaning period ?
(2) How to teach pups to lap?
(1) Administration of good nourish-
ing milk (with butter or cream added)
or baby foods made entirely from
milk, from the age of three weeks,
once or twice daily, will ensure that
the weaning process is gradual and at
the same time reduce the strain on
the bitch. Good soup into which
wholemeal bread or similar cereals
have been mixed may be introduced
about the fourth week, and very
finely-scraped raw beef at five weeks.
Gradually increase the number of
meals per day, and by the end of the
fifth week the puppies should be prac-
tically weaned, and the bitch starting
to dry-up in milk. (2) Place the food
in a saucer and lower the pup’s head
until his nose just touches the con-
tents. He will blow and. suck for a
while, but after a few lessons he will
master the art of lapping. Do not let
him suck it from the side of the
saucer, and it is far better to feed
each pup separately if the time can
be spared.

What is heroic verse?
That verse in which epic poetry is
generally written, so called because
it is employed to celebrate heroic ex-
ploits. In Greek and Latin it is hexa-
meter verse; in English it is ten-
syllable iambic verse, either in rhymes
or not; in Italian it is the ottava rima.
The English heroic verse becomes the
heroic couplet when used in rhymed
pairs of lines. The 18th-century
poets, particularly Dryden and Pope,
brought its use to a high degree of
perfection.

Origin of the phrase “Dame Parting-
ton and her mop” ?
A taunt against those who try to
withstand progress. Sydney Smith,
speaking on the English House of
Lords’ rejection of the Reform Bill,
October, 1831, compares them to
Dame Partington with her mop try-
ing to push back the Atlantic. “She
was excellent,” he says, “at a slop or
a puddle, but should never have
meddled with a tempest.” The story
is that a Mrs, Partington had a cot-
tage on the shore at Sidmouth,
Devon. In November, 1824, a heavy
gale drove the waves into her house,
and the old lady labored with a mop
to sop the water up.

SUNDRY SHOWS
"The Black Swan."
“The Black Swan,” an Aus-
tralian ballet (choreography
Borovansky; music Sibelius),
had its first Sydney airing in the
current Borovansky programme
at Sydney Empire. It deals, in
three scenes, with the visit of a
Dutch ship to the banks of the
Swan River in Western Aus-
tralia—the first scene is a bright,
lively farewell at the Amsterdam
docks; the second is a brief
shipboard incident wherein the
young Dutch lieutenant dreams
of his fiancee back in Holland
and the Black Swan, symbol of
Australia ; the last scene is set
by the Swan River with the
young lieutenant expressing his
love fof and reluctance to leave
the new land.
In that its theme seems to fall
naturally to the choreographer’s
purposes, the production is the
best Australian ballet this com-
mentator has seen. And, largely
because of William Constable’s
decor and costumes —the sug-
gestion of hot sun and sand with
the greys, greens, golds and
browns of the trees —there is an
Australian bush atmosphere in
the last scene.
In the interests of perfect
economy the last scene, in that it
expresses the whole story of the
ballet, is the only one really
necessary—the first scene is a
jovial dockside gambol which
could stand alone on its merits ;
the shipboard interlude is like-
wise only a brief graceful
incident and its one perfect
moment —Edna Busse’s arrow-
like leap—could be incorporated
in the last scene.
Still, that is probably too-
exacting a demand. Superfluity
is the only thing one might
criticise about the first two
scenes —and one has come to sit
through a lot of beautiful super-
fluity in ballet.
Borovansky’s choreography
in the last scene is graceful and
fluid with some admirable
grouping, and, as in the sudden
birdlike scatter of the swans
when the sailors arrive,' even
more admirable movement.
Edna Busse’s dancing as the
Black Swan is the best she has
done this season—under all its
graceful, poignant feeling there
is that fine accuracy and steel-
spring-like elasticity that one
looks for in the best of them,
and which characterises Miss
Busse’s dancing at its best. Ken
Gillespie as the young lieutenant,
with all the necessary manner,
appearance and ability, needs
only a Jittle more polish to make
him an excellent male dancer.
Repeat performances of “Les
Sylphides,” with some fine, ex-
pressive dancing from Dorothy
Stevenson, and “Petrouchka,”
with a very articulate perform-
ance from Martin Rubinstein,
complete the programme.
A New Australian.
Antony Karafylakis, a Greek
artist who has been nine months
in Australia, paints in such a
variety of styles that it is diffi-
cult to know what to make of
his exhibition at Sydney Gros-
venor Galleries. Perhaps it is
not his best work, but a random
collection of what happened to
be left in his studio when he de-
cided to emigrate.
There are sunny landscapes of
Greek hills and churches, pos-
sibly influenced by Cezanne;
seascapes done with the palette-
knife ; completely academic por-
traits, thin and oily, alongside a
study of an old woman who
might have derived from Rem-
brandt ; street scenes and a
ferocious self-portrait in the con-
temporary “industrial” manner;
religious paintings in the Byzan-
tine style.
Many of the paintings, includ-
ing some first attempts to cope
with Australian light in Harbor
scenes, look sentimental and
amateurish; on the other hand,
Mr. Karafylakis has at least one
—sometimes more—successful
painting in each of his many
styles: the portrait of the old
“Greek Lady”; the street scene
of “Night During the Occupa-
tion of Athens” ; “Flowers,” an
attractive still-life on a large
scale ; and the landscapes “Small
Byzantine Church,” “The Light-
house of Saint Nicholas,
Rhodes” and “Old Well.”
Music.
If Yehudi Menuhin listeners at
Sydney Town Hall wondered
what they had done to deserve
Serge Prokofiev’s Sonata in F
Minor, it at least gave them a
further opportunity to marvel at
the technical wizardry at the
virtuoso’s seemingly effortless
command, for the “work”
abounds in difficulties if not in
music. There could be nothing
to cavil at in the remainder of
the programmes Menuhin has
offered. With Bach he seems to
have an especial affinity, and in
the vast sweep of the unaccom-
panied Sonata in E Major he
found expression for every
mood, with a beautiful mellow
richness of tone in serene
passages. One of the hap-
piest choices was the 4th
Concerto of Paganini, in which
Leon Pommers gave added
proof, if it were needed, of his
excellence as an accompanist.
The “tripping” bow work and
the glissandos were Menuhin at
his best.

Justus Bonn, the Dutch tenor,
was in fine voice—a great im-
provement on his earlier recital,
when he was handicapped by a
cold —when at Sydney Con. he
sang the 24 songs that make up
Sqhubert’s great song-cycle, the
“Winter Journey.” These songs
demand a big range, and that is
exactly what Mr. Bono has.
The success of the recital owed
much also to the work of
Leo Demant —in this cycle
piano and voice are of almost
equal importance.

Dr. Edgar Bainton conducted
his own Symphony in D Minor
with the Sydney Orchestra last
week. Though of no great
thematic invention, the texture
of the score is strong and well-
knit, and it falls pleasingly
enough on the ear. A particu-
larly good balance is held be-
tween strings and woodwinds in
the scherzando. At the same
concert Eugene Goossens
wielded the baton over an
f.a.q. reading of Rimsky-
Korsakov’s long Russian Easter
Festival Overture, and an excel-
lent performance of Brahms’s
Symphony No. 3.

To provide for all-round expansion of
the business, this big merchandising,
agency, shipping and investment organisa-
tion offered those on the share register
at Jan. 31, 1951, 1,000,000 new £l shares,
one for two, at par, payable ss. applica-
tion March 31, and the balance in ss.
calls at six-monthly intervals. The issue
(first since 1938) will lift paid capital to
£3,000,000, on which 12} p.c. would call
for £375,000, or £10,684 less profit than
was shown last term. So maintenance of
current rate of distribution should present
no difficulty while the growth in turn-
over continues to take care of the growth
in costs.
Turnover—merchandising is the best
profit-earning section of the business —in-
creased by £1,164,179, reaching
£25,629,849 last term. The improvement
in gross earnings was £376,567:
1948. 1949. 1950. 1951.

Of the growth of £152,627 in working
exes., etc., £115,021 was on account of
wages and salaries, which took their
biggest leap toward the close of accounts.
The allowance for depreciation (£402,287)
was £193,704 heavier, due to the large
amount written off shipping, following
construction in U.K. of a new 3750-ton
vessel at a cost of about £600,000. The
final profit figure (up £23,085) was 19.3
p.c. on capital as against 18.1, 17.2, 16.4,
15 and 11.6 p.c. back to 1946. The div.,
steady at 10 p.c. for the 29 years to
1948, was kept at 12} p.c.
In addition to the undistributed portion
of the year’s net earnings, visible reserves
benefited by £111,639 on account of
deferred Government payment in con-
nection with the loss of the m.-v. Macdhui
by enemy action during the war. This
amount “may be used to write down the
cost of the new vessel” already referred
to, the chairman says. The shipping
section, once a substantial contributor to
profits, is now a lame duck. Last term
it didn’t earn enough to provide adequate
depreciation for the fleet; the allowance
that was made came from the earnings of
other sections of the business. Com-
pared with pre-war less than half the
amount of cargo is being handled per
gang per hour per hatch. Vessels on the
Singapore run are taking up to five months
for a round voyage, as against a regular
two-monthly schedule pre-war.
The holding in subsidiaries (£2,190,402)
increased by £71,238. Chief offshoots are
Burns Philp (South Seas), Burns Philp
(New Hebrides) and Burns Philp (New
Guinea). In addition the parent runs a
flourishing chain-store business in Queens-
land and northern N. S. Wales under
the name of Penneys. The board is con-
sidering incorporation of this section of
the business into a limited-liability co.,
in which “all the shares will be retained
as an investment” by the parent.
Sundry shareholdings and Government
securities (£1,609,107) were reduced by
£157,901, mainly to provide new capital
for and advances to subsidiaries. The
shareholdings include scrip in Queensland
Insurance, Bankers and Traders Insurance
and a string of country and suburban
stores in N. S. Wales, mostly acquired
since the war.
When the books closed only £176,858 of
the new capital had come in:
1949. 1950. 1951.

The growths of £195,274 in liabilities,
£216,826 in stocks, etc., and £248,721 in
book debts mainly reflect bigger trading
at higher prices. Depreciation accounts
for more than the reduction (£116,026)
in the book-value of properties and ship-
ping.
The co.’s £1 shares, which are among
the leaders in the market, shot up from
975. to 117 s. 6d. following announcement
of the new issue in October last. The ex-
rights price has since fluctuated between
775. and 87s. 6d. Recent sales were at the
higher figure, giving a return of 2.9 p.c.
on a 12} p.c. div. basis. On the same
basis the 55.-paid contribs. (now 705.)
would return 3 p.c. when fully paid. Net
tangible cover (book-value) is 50s. lid.

This big more - than - century - old
emporium enjoys a wide reputation
for service and quality—which means,
among other things, offering good
value for money. However, owing to the
universal nature of the business (it handles
practically everything that falls under the
broad heading of merchandise, from
machinery to fashion goods) and the wide
area it covers (country trade figures
prominently in turnover), the co.’s
problems are wider, more numerous and
more complicated than those of other
retail establishments doing a purely city
turnover in more-or-less specialised,
quick lines.
The main factors governing the level
of retail profits today are: (1) Turnover,
(2) gross margins and (3) costs. With
wage and all other costs, including the
cost of delivery, advancing at a disquiet-
ing rate, and gross margins (largely con-
trolled) diminishing, profit has become
increasingly a function of turnover. Last
term’s “very satisfactory” increase in the
volume and value of sales, especially
during the last half of the period, more
than offset the persistent rise in wage and
other costs, which became pronounced
toward the close of accounts —the payroll
total alone is now over 30 p.c,
greater than a year ago. That
conservative indicator of the retail price
level, the “G” series index, showed a rise
of 13 p.c. for 1950, whereas the whole-
sale index increased by 18.9 p.c.—the
British wholesale index rose by 21.2 p.c.
The £131,547 (up £6173) of profit was
written after allowing an extra £10,869
for depreciation (£97,850), dropping
£5OOO into the reserve for alterations
(£50,000) and making an unspecified pro-
vision for taxation and other con-
tingencies. It was 6.5 p.c. on the
£2,000,000 of share capital—£7so,ooo
carries a cumulative 1} p.c., subject to
the N. S, Wales Interest Reduction Act—
compared with 6.2, 7.5, 7.5, 7.2 and 5.9
p.c. back to 1946. An all-round 6 p.c.
was distributed for the fifth year in
succession. For the eight years to 1945
the ords. received a steady 5 p.c, and the
prefs. a regular 5.8 p.c. In addition to
the £283,819 of free reserves shown in
the table, there are specific provisions of
£536,837 for depreciation and alterations ;
and fixed assets are known to be worth
a lot more than book-value.

The sharp increase of £339,505 in book

and extension of factory activities show
up in a net growth of £65,025 in free-
holds, etc., and of £20,877 in plant, etc.
Only £195,060 was added to the amount
coming to creditors, etc. —the etcetera is
an unspecified provision for contin-
gencies. The improvement in the more-
or-less liquid surplus (£1,055,189, includ-
ing stocks) was £28,495.
Although the overall outlook is expan-
sionary, the present inflationary trend,
undoubtedly holds a sting in its tail. The
position in this respect will become less
obscure when the Treasurer brings down
his next Budget. Some increase in co.
and other taxation is foreshadowed, and
perhaps inevitable. Still, it is important
that we should not fall into the fallacy
of thinking that inflation can be effec-
tively curbed by taxation and price and
other controls alone. Industry’s instinc-
tive dislike for controls has a solid base in
the knowledge of the stultifications to
which they give rise. Our most urgent
need is more and still more produc-
tivity, combined with careful spending.
Wealth cannot be created just by chang-
ing one price-ticket for another bearing
a higher figure; it can follow only on
higher effort. And the Government
would do well to partly offset the con-
templated heavy increase in defence
expenditure by reduced public expendi-
ture elsewhere.
The market anticipates no change in
the co.’s rate of distribution, and prices

This is the big holding co. that was
formed in London in Feb., 1949, to con-
solidate the expanding interests of Zinc
Corp. and its string of subsidiary and
associated cos. in the mining, smelting
and allied industries in Australia and
Britain. The aim was simplification of
group control, management, policy integ-
ration, finance and development; and the
operational programme was planned on
the assumption that the then high level
of metal prices—they have gone much
higher since—would not long continue.
The principal subsidiaries and their
ramifications in Australia are; Zinc Corp<
(lead-zinc mining at the Barrier), B.H.
Corp. (100 p.c. interest in Sulphide Corp.,
which turns out sulphuric acid, super-
phosphate and cement at Cockle Creek,
near Newcastle, a 50 p.c. interest in B.H.
Associated Smelters at Port Pirie, a
30 p.c. interest in. New B.H. Consolidated,
which adjoins Zinc Corp. at the Barrier)
and Consolidated Zinc Pty. (which owns
four small offshoots interested in saw-
milling, treatment of beach sands, electric
power production and the search for new
mineral deposits). In Britain : Imperial
Smelting Corp., which owns all the issued
capital in National Smelting Corp.,
operating zinc roasters, smelters and sul-
phuric acid plants at Avonmouth, Swan-
sea and Seaton Carew. The National co.
is also interested in seven subsidiary and
associated concerns on its own account.
In addition the Imperial co. has direct
holdings in British Titanium Products,
Capper Pass and Son, Fisons and Wolver-
hampton Metal Co.
Consolidated net earnings of the group
reflect market conditions, mainly the rise
in metal prices and strong demand for
smelted and processed products, selling-
prices of which advanced more or less in
line with material and production cost
increases. London metal prices per ton
moved in this way:

Average figures per ton for 1950 were
lead £SIOB Is. lid. (up £S3 9s. lOd.)
and zinc £SII9 7s, Id. (up £S32 os. Bd.).
Rearmament and stockpiling are the
main factors behind the lift.
After allowing £585,596 (up £158,009)
for depreciation and £3,011,419 (up
£933,692) for taxation, aggregate net
earnings were £1,429,680 (up £202,561),
which covered the holding co.’s pref. div.
and 20.1 p.c. on its ord. capital. That
disregards a transfer of £397,856 from
tax reserves, etc., to free reserves. The
provision for depreciation was in excess
of the normal wear-and-tear allowance,
because of the rise in cost of replace-
ments and heavy capital-expenditure pro-
gramme ahead (£846,000). Official assess-
ment of unrealised zinc concentrates (in
the books at cost or under) helped to
bump up the tax provision. The ord. div.
was kept at 2s. 6d. a share, 12} p.c.
gross, which English income tax (now
9s. 6d. in the £) reduces to 6.56 p.c. in
the hands of shareholders, which is equal
to 8.2 p.c. in Australian currency at the
current rate of exchange.
Profits of individual units are not
tabulated in the report, but the three
biggest contributors are probably Zinc
Corp., Imperial Smelting and B.H. Corp.
The Imperial co. reports an overflowing
order book, and good progress with plant
modernisation and expansion, which con-
tributed to increased output of all main
products, especially zinc and sulphuric
acid, both in very short supply. Sales
of other units of the English group in-
creased, too.
At Broken Hill (N.S.W.) Zinc Corp.
milled less ore but probably earned more
profit, owing to the lift in metal prices.

The drop in tonnage was due to shortage
of labor and plant shut-downs. Of ore
treated 10 p.c. was sold to New B.H.
Consolidated under agreement, which has
now run out. The balance of the mill-
feed, handled on the co.’s own account,

COMPANY MEETING
Younghusband Has
a Satisfactory Year
SIR CLIVE McPHERSON. chairman of Young-
husband Ltd., reported a very satisfactory year
to shareholders at the 62nd annual general
meeting, held in Melbourne May 29th.
In his address, Sir Clive McPherson
said:
“It is with pleasure that I have to
report very satisfactory results for the
past year. Seasonal conditions until
recently have been favorable in the
districts where our company is prin-
cipally interested, and in consequence
the wool clip has proved of a high
standard.
“Our turnover of stock has proved
a record, both in numbers and in the
amount of money involved; we have,
fortunately, been able to secure our
share of the general business through
the possession of our 42 country
branches.
“I am happy to report satisfactory
business in all these branches which
have materially assisted in making a
record in turnover for the company.
STOCK
“Stock numbers for Australia have
made a satisfactory recovery after the
severe losses through the drought of
1945 —sheep figures for last census
taken in March, 1950, being 113 mil-
lion, and though the figures for
March, 1951, are not available, we
should have today in Australia about
120 million sheep.
“Our cattle population in March,
1950, numbered 14£ million.
WHEAT
“Wheat crop returns for the past
season were satisfactory, 170 million
bushels having been delivered to the
Australian Wheat Board for the sea-
son 1950-51 as compared with 202
million bushels for 1949-50.
WOOL
“Our wool receipts for the year
commencing Ist April, 1950, have
proved a record, and with the prices
ruling throughout the season the turn-
over is beyond that of any previous
year in the company’s history.
GENERAL CONDITIONS
“The views so often expressed at
our annual meetings as to the neces-
sity for more production, discipline,
respect for the law, wisdom in Gov-
ernment —cannot be too strongly
emphasised today.
“I think it is generally recognised
that unless we as a community are
prepared to adopt a course based on
these sound precedents of the past we
shall fritter away the greatest oppor-
tunity that has ever come to Aus-
tralia; and let us not be misguided
enough to think that such conditions
as the present will continue indefi-
nitely.
“First, and above all, let us re-
member that the putting aside of re-
serves in industry at such a period is
of the utmost importance and has
proved so down through the ages.
“I have no hesitation in again ex-
pressing to our leaders in Govern-
ment that such is essential, and pro-
vision should accordingly be allowed
for in any consideration of our future
economy.
“It cannot be gainsaid that oui
primary industries at present are
especially prosperous, and the effect
throughout our economy has been a
major factor in Australian general
prosperity. This has always been, and
will continue to be, whilst such con-
ditions exist.
TAXATION
“In view of heavy future taxation
as a result of this year’s increased
wool value, and having regard to
what provisional tax will mean to
those whose income shows a steep
rise to 30th June, 1951, growers
would be well advised to anticipate
same by making provision, after con-
sultation with their taxation experts,
before entering into further per-
manent commitments.
“Provisional tax (first imposed in
1944) in the light of present experi-
ence may very well prove embarras-
sing to the individual in the first in-
stance, and also to the Government
when the time arrives that heavy re-
funds become due. It is a tax that
could well be gradually eliminated
over the years.
INFLATION
“In addition to increased produc-
tion, Government economy and credit
restraints are amongst the main fac-
tors necessary to stem the inflationary
trend. It is worthy of note that quite
recently an interesting statement has
been issued in America by 227 econo-
mists representing 27 of the nation’s
colleges and universities, concerning
anti-inflationary policies. This state-
ment advocates elimination or post-
ponement of all Government expendi-
tures that are not urgent and essential.
It recommends restricting credit for
purposes not essential to the defence
programme. It points out that
stability of the general level of prices
would be impossible in the face ol
general wage increases that sub-
stantially raise costs and private
spendable incomes.
“The statement goes on ‘that in
the absence of such measures a pro
longed decline in the purchasing
power of the dollar would undermine
the very foundations of society, or an
ever-spreading system of direct con-
trols could jeopardise our system ot
free enterprise and free collective bar-
gaining.’
“These statements are worthy of
note to Australia, hut whilst included
in these recommendations is one for
increased taxation, I should prefer in
this comparatively young country,
where there is not the accumulated
wealth as in America, to see some
measure of compulsory saving for the
present, rather than increased taxa-
tion. Such savings in the hands of
the people will, some day in the
future, prove of great value to the
community.
“I would like to make myself clear
in connection with our general out-
look on taxation.
“Of course, no one appreciates
heavy taxation in any form, but there
come times in a nation’s history when
‘preparedness for self-preservation’
must be the first consideration. World
affairs —so unsettled —so prominently
before all peoples today—justify our
Government in Australia in making
such preparations, and in this respect
we realise that any calls upon us
should be willingly and cheerfully
responded to.
“Let the people beware of being
led up the easy path. There is no
easy way in the long run to pros-
perity, which depends on the proper
husbanding of resources in good
times in order that they may be avail-
able when the swing back comes —
such is the history of industry, and,
indeed, the history of nations. His-
tory relates that disaster has come to
nations not by the way of work and
frugality, but rather by following the
easy way and the sacrifice of the
future for the ease of the present.
“History is there for all to read—
when Rome fell from her high estate
half the population was in the public
service, and many things in existence
that we see around us today. The
old Romans were a great people.
They dominated the world —they built
things that lasted for a thousand years
—yet they came to decay through
being led the easy way.
“Down through our history British
people have shown that they can pull
themselves through their difficulties
by work and thrift —let us hope all
our people will realise what is now
necessary for permanent prosperity to
the community before it is too late.
“You will have noted from our re-
port that gross earnings have reflected
the increased turnover in all sections,
and, of course, this is accompanied
by considerably increased expenditure
—fortunately, increased earnings have
more than kept pace with increased
costs.
“Your directors have not lost sight
of the necessity to make what is, in
their judgment, suitable provision foi
contingencies, which in such periods
as the present must be carefully con-
sidered; the question of reserves in
industry, to which I have referred, is
a matter which sound management
must in these days regard as of the
first importance.
BRANCHES
“Our branches now number 42, and,
as already stated, have played an im-
portant part in helping to build and
maintain our record turnover.
STAFF
“I would like, on behalf of the
board of directors, to express thanks
to all members of the staff for the
manner in which the year’s work has
been carried out.
“All sections have responded wil-
lingly to the extra demands, and
though staff replacements are difficult
to secure—in sections we require
further personnel—the work has been
happily and efficiently carried
through.”
zinc concentrates were produced.
Concentrates had accumulated
at balancing-date, owing to in-
terruptions to rail services.
Blocked ore reserves at Dec, 31,
1950, were: lead lode 5,100,000
tons (up 200,000 tons), assaying
15.4 p.c. lead, 3.20 z. silver and
10.8 p.c. zinc; zinc lode 450,000
tons (unchanged), assaying 7.0
p.c, lead, 1.40 z. silver and 17.0
p.c. zinc. More ore is known to
exist outside measured limits.
Sulphide Corp. reported im-
proved trading results, despite
short delivery of concentrates
for roasting and rising costs.
Features of combined balance-
sheet figures are expansion,
bigger trading and a strong
financial position;—

It was the rise in metal prices
—for details, see review of Con-
solidated Zinc Corp, elsewhere
on these pages—that took care
of the growth in costs and pot
the spring of £68,717 m last
years profit (£472,731), which
was 42.1 p.c. on capital as
against 36 p.c. and 38 p.c. for
the two preceding years. Ex-
penditure on development was
£79,452 (down £19,885) and
£480,400 (up £171,400) was re-
served for taxation. A lot of
money is still needed to com-
plete equipment and develop-
ment of the mine, so the board
decided to keep the div. at a
nominal 30 p.c., equal to 15£
p.c. after allowing for English
income tax (now 9s. 6d. in the
£). In Australian currency 151
p.c. sterling is worth 19f p.c. at
the current rate of exchange.
Thus £293,436 of the year’s net
earnings was ploughed back into
the business, and reserves also
benefited by an unexplained
addition of £6402 net, as well as
by £155,000 previous overprovi-
sion for taxation.
The market, which has ex-
pected a lift in the div., shortened
its bid for the f.-p. ss. shares
from 395, 6d. to 375. 6d. follow-
ing publication of the accounts.
The immediate return at 375. 6d.
is 2.5 p.c. on the basis of last
year’s distribution, with adjust-
ments for the tax and exchange
already mentioned. The actual
return to individual share-
holders is also subject to adjust-
ments in connection with double
taxation.
The co, mined 165,668 tons
(down 9564 tons) ore from its
own leases, which adjoin those
of Zinc Corp. at the Barrier
(N.S.W.). It also bought 43,332
tons (down 5551 tons) of richer
ore from Zinc Corp. under con-
tract, now expired. The lot
assayed 10.5 p.c. lead, 2.30 z.
silver and 12.6 p.c. zinc (slightly
better than the previous year),
and was put through the Corp.’s
mill for the following results:

About a quarter of the lead (con-
centrates are smelted at Port
Pirie) and about 40 p.c. of the
zinc are sold locally and the bal-
ance mainly to Britain. The
drop in ore extracted (haulage
was through Z.C.’s shaft) was
due to diversion of labor to de-
velopment at the lower levels,
where “highly satisfactory” re-
sults have been obtained.
Co.’s own main haulage shaft
(down 3250 ft.) is not expected
to be in full-scale operation be-
fore the beginning of 1952. Ex-
cavations for loading and crush-
ing stations at bottom levels are
well in hand. Stripping and con-
creting of the near-by service
shaft should be completed by the
end of 1951.

The reduction in the cash hold-
ing, etc., was £424,861. Liabili-
ties include £599,097 of current
and deferred tax reserves.
When fully developed the
mine promises to rival other
great producers of the field. For
reasons already stated, output for
1951 is likely to fall short of
total tonnage treated on the co.’s
account last year. The aim is to
lift extraction to 242,000 tons
by end 1952. How long the
boom in metal prices will con-
tinue is a question to which no
clear-cut answer can be given at
the moment; much depends
upon the duration and tempo of
the world-wide rearmament pro-
gramme.


Women's Letters

In spite of the balmy weather and
many social events, the thoughts of Syd-
ney during the week have been mainly
occupied with transport problems. For
once the dailies were justified in their
method of reporting a public function,
which is to devote a double column to (a)
how hard it was to get to it; (b) how
hard it was to get away from it; (c) what
the transport department said ; ( d) what
the police said ; ( e) what selected members
of the crowd said. After that there is
generally not much space left to tell what
the function was like.
The congestion in the foyer of the
Menuhin concerts does on this policy
merit at least a few lines. If you have
strong elbows or broad shoulders you
may be able to progress a few yards.
If you are over six feet tall you may be
seen by your friends. Otherwise it’s
better to stay quietly in your seat and
forgo the cigarette which, after all, only
adds volume to that hurricane of coughs
which greets the end of every item.
Over 10,000 people went to the Haw-
kesbury Race Meeting, which shows that
you can get places if you really want to.
The uninitiated, who thought they’d be
going up Newcastle way, were surprised
when the trains and cars bore them
towards Windsor and eventually delivered
them at Clarendon instead of the Brook-
lyn they had expected. The clear, sunny
day and the setting within sight of the
mountains were quite perfect, and all
present enjoyed themselves (except the
bookmakers). It was a thrill to see Mel-
bourne Cup winner Foxzami give an
exhibition gallop with the Melbourne
Cup jockey W. Fellows riding him. The
only drawback to the whole proceedings
was that there was hardly any water. No
one could make tea, and even the men
had to go thirsty after the beer ran out,
which was about half-way through the
afternoon.
There was a very gay atmosphere at
the Dominican Ex-students’ dance when
the Troc. was decorated with crests and
pennants from all the Dominican schools
—flowers, masses of balloons and
streamers. The president of the 0.G.U.,
Mrs. R. J. Lyons, welcomed as official
guests Air Vice-Marshal J. P, J, Mac-
Cauley and Mrs. MacCauley, to whom
the 22 debutantes were presented by
Mrs. Bruce McLachlan. The debs were
about the prettiest group seen this season,
and their dresses were notably attractive.
Dr. and Mrs. R. Nihill entertained a
large party which included the H. G. Galls
from Moree. Caroline Nihill and
Patricia Gall both made their debut,
Caroline in white taffeta checked with a
silver thread and Patricia in embroidered
organdie. Among the young people in
the party were Thea and Rom Vassil,
Pamela McTaggert, Sylvia Potts, John
Kirkwood and David Nelson.
There are many “presidents” of various
things in Sydney, but perhaps the warm-
est, friendliest, most motherly is Mrs.
Karl Kumm, 0.8. E., who presides over
the National Y.W.C.A. At a reception
given for her during the week at the
association rooms she spoke of her
travels in Canada, England and Denmark.
Her message to women is that we should
all try to understand one another better.
She is sure that if we “get together with”
the women of other nations, all inter-
national problems will be solved. Per-
perhaps if all women were as friendly as
Mrs. Kumm it might be easy. At the
meeting were the Lady Mayoress, Mrs.
C. P. Johnson, Mrs, H. Mowll, Commis-
sioner James (of the Salvation Army),
and Mrs. R. E. Pratt (from W.A.).
It might be easier for reporters to
mention the functions our Lady Mayoress
(Mrs. E. C. O’Dea) is not at than those
she does attend. Last Wednesday she was
at the Y.W.C.A. reception, an afternoon
party at Mrs. Bridgeford’s, a five-o’clock
reception at the Royal Empire rooms,
and at night she received the debs at the
St. Scholastica’s ex-students’ dance. Her
recipe for energy would be well worth-
while patenting.
Who is Mrs. M. Milled? The pro-
gramme of that charming Borovansky
ballet “The Black Swan” tells us that
she wrote the story, but beyond that
nothing. Another injustice to women!
This ballet must be unique in that it
starts in one country (Holland) and ends
in another (Australia). It has all the
eerie quality one imagines sailors must
feel on seeing a new strange land, and
the decor by Bill Constable (we know
who he is) is strong, eye-catching and
new.

Here we have Beatrice Dray, who
figured in our Letter a couple of months
ago as Beatrice Walker, of Woolooga
(Q’ld.). When she was married to Teddy
Dray, also of Woolooga, at St. Patrick’s,
Gympie, she wore a billowy tulle dress
with a bodice of angelskin lace, and a
three-tier tulle veil cascading from a lace
cap. Her attendants were Gay Dray, in
pale-green organdie, and little Margaret
Burton, in pale-pink. Beatrice was in
charge of the school at Wonga Lower
before her marriage, and both she and
Teddy come from long-established dairy-
ing and grazing families. Their honey-
moon was spent in North Queensland
and on the Barrier Reef.
Marjorie Lawrence draws the crowds,
not only at her recitals, but also at the
parties given in her honor. There were
about 300 people to greet her at the re-
ception by the Australian-American
Association, held at Prince’s. Specially-
invited guests to meet her were Mrs. R.
Ramage, president of the American
Women’s Club, Mrs. R. Conacher and
Mrs. J. Barker. Young soprano Marjorie
Conley charmed the company with her
singing, along with tenor Ron Dowd and
15-year-old violinist Maurice Stead.
The following evening Miss Lawrence
was entertained by the ladies of the
A.B.C. Orchestral Committee. It was a
“zoned” day, but the committee had
made the very best of it with many lamps
and masses of poinsettia and red autumn
berries. Present were Lady Anderson, the
Lady Mayoress, Lady Giilan (who leaves
for England shortly, much to our regret),
Lady Lloyd Jones in a wondrous mink
coat and a diamente-studded black hat,
Mrs. Hope Gibson, looking very well
after her holiday at Cobbity, and Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Moses.
It was inspiring to see Miss Lawrence
so happy and confident in spite of the
fact that she can neither walk nor stand
unsupported. She spoke with simplicity,
charm and appeal, saying how much she
appreciated the co-operation of the
A.B.C. in producing “Elektra” and
“Salome,” which she had always wanted
to sing in Australia, although she was
told in England that Australia was not
yet ready for them. Miss Lawrence is very
fond of hats (like most of us), and she
nearly always chooses something
spectacular. At Prince’s she wore a large
red cartwheel, and at the orchestral party
a smaller one covered with velvet parma-
violets with a muff to match.
“The Voice of the Woman in France”
is a soft one like Eve’s, according to
Madame Biddulph, who spoke on the sub-
ject at the general meeting of the National
Council of Women, but it’s still quite as
persuasive as our first parent’s. The
women of France were given the vote
only in 1945, but after the first election
there were about 28 women in Parlia-
ment. When a Frenchwoman marries she
becomes a minor in law, subject legally
to her husband, just as children are sub-
ject to their parents here, yet she con-
trols most of the small businesses through
power-of-attorney, as her husband is so
often away on military service. Madame
Biddulph claims that the Frenchwoman’s
femininity is of greater value to her than
the vote has been to us, and she defines
femininity as “power without muscle.”
Frenchwomen have been attending uni-
versities for the past 700 years, but it is
by her charm and a little of the tell-me-
all-about-it-darling technique that she
controls her husband’s political opinions
today. Madame Biddulph’s argument was
very persuasive. It might be worth look-
ing into, this charm business.
From Melbourne
The busy world was hushed for 60
minutes as the late Field-Marshal Sir
Thomas Blarney was borne through the
streets of the city he loved so well, on the
way to his last resting-place. The only
sounds which broke the reverent silence
were the steady tramp of marching feet
and the hum of a plane engine high over-
head. A small group of uniformed Army
nurses followed the remains of their late
Commancfer-in-Chief, Fastened to the
flag which covered the casket was a
small bouquet of daphne. It was his
widow’s tribute ; that flower had been Sir
Thomas’s favorite. Many of his men
who marched in the funeral procession,
and the nurses also, must have thought, on
seeing that, of Lady Blarney’s own selfless
efforts in the Middle East. Ohe Army
sister remembers going to her ward in
the desert hospital during a terrific sand-
storm and finding Lady Blarney there,
busily writing letters for the sick and
wounded men,
Christ Church, South Yarra, was the
setting for the marriage of Roberta
Margaret, eldest daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. W. A. Bott, of Yarrawonga, and
John Hamilton, only son of Mr. Hugh
Sloane, of Mulwala (N.S.W.), and the late
Mrs Sloane. The bride’s gown of pastel-
pink satin had a fitted bodice with a deep
square neckline outlined with a flat collar,
a full skirt extending into a train. Tiny
posies of orange-blossom were set at each
side of the pink rouleaux which held the
pink tulle veil, and she carried a bouquet
of Ophelia roses. Pretty maids in atten-
dance were Sue Botterill and Valerie
Llewellyn. They wore full-skirted frocks
of white organza mounted on pink. A
wreath of Cecil Brunner roses worn in
their hair matched the bouquets they
carried. Best man was Frank Maclndoe,
and groomsman John Douglas. Reception
was held at the Hotel Windsor.
This photo, by David Fell of
Gwen, only daughter of Lieut.-Colonel
and Mrs. A. E. Reed, of Caulfield, was
taken at a dance given to her by her
parents at the New Alexandra, East St,
Kilda, to celebrate her coming-of-age.
Gwen is doing her final year in nursing
at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and
when that is completed is off to England
and the Continent for a holiday.
Over 100 guests were received by Lieut.-
Colonel and Mrs. Reed, the latter
wearing a Parma-violet velvet gown,
which had an off-the-shoulder neckline.
Gwen’s strapless gown was of pearl-pink
astrakhan satin patterned with a faint
tracery design. Tiny leaves of satin
trimmed the bodice in front and the skirt
featured a slight bustle. Over this she
wore a platina-fox cape, the gift of her
parents. Among the old school-friends
and nurses who danced were Margaret
Edwards, whose pale-gold faille frock had
floating side-panels and the halter neck
and bodice embroidered in crystal bugle-
beads ; Judy Wamock, in pale-pink
spotted net; Betty Jackson, the square
neck of her long-sleeved bottle-green
velvet Tudor gown outlined with lace;
Jocelyn Sampson, in geranium-red velvet;
Libby Smith, her ballerina frock of pale-
lilac, silk-striped taffeta ; Avril Goldstone,
in a bouffant pink self-patterned organza
frock; Nan Dixon, her taffetas pink-
and-grey checked; Bardi Henderson,
wearing white organza on bouffant lines ;
Pam Dickins, in dusty-pink taffeta ; Mardi
Miller, whose cornflower-blue taffeta
gown had red roses at the hipline; Ann
McDonald, in champagne satin ; and Mrs.
Marie Flannery, of Forbes (N.S.W.), who
chose a pleated pale-gold satin gown.
The facade of St. Kilda Town Hall was
illuminated by searchlights, and the ball-
room decorated with red, white and blue
flowers, bunting and shields for the
Southern Command Jubilee Ball. The
Governor, Lady Brooks, and their
daughter Jeanette were present, Lady
Brooks in a lovely bouffant gown of
pastel-pink lace mounted on matching
satin; a frill of lace outlined the low,
rounded neckline. Jeanette’s white
organza gown had the hemline defined
by deep frills in which were set tiny
blush-pink roses. The officer command-
ing Southern Command, Lieut.-General
H. Wells, and his wife received the vice-
regal party, Mrs. Wells wearing a gown
of pale-lilac and silver brocade. Lieut.-
General S. F, Rowell was accompanied
by his wife, whose pale-blue tulle gown
was topped by a jacket of deep-blue
massed with sequins. His daughter
Rosslyn wore bronze-brown taffetas.
Mrs. Rufus Ramey, wife of the U.S.
Military Attache, Col. Ramey, wore a
slim-fitting gown of midnight-blue velvet.
Mrs. A. J. Boase danced in pale-lilac
crepe. Mrs. C. H. Kappe’s Parma-violet
velvet gown had the halter neckline.
Mrs. D. T. Maxwell, wife of Col. Max-
well, of the N.Z. Army, wore American-
beauty crepe. Mrs. Trevor West’s un-
usual gown, made from a silk sari, had
multicolored polka-dots on a white
ground ; bands of the dominant colors
outlined the strapless bodice and the
shoulder-drape. Mrs. D. H. Crompton
wore ice-blue-and-silver lame. Mrs. Ivor
Cardan’s choice was black Chantilly lace
mounted on white satin. Mrs. A. T. J.
Bell covered her champagne-tinted satins
with a matching chiffon stole, Mrs,
Bernard Evans wore royal-blue crepe,
with the deep cap sleeves embossed with
silver sequins. A band of mink outlined
the strapless bodice of the cinnamon
crepe gown worn by Mrs. John Hunter-
Yule. Proceeds from the ball will be
divided among the Carry On Club, the
A.I.F. War Widows’ Association and the
R.A.A.F. Scholarship Fund.
Nancy Weir was soloist with the Vic-
torian Symphony Orchestra under Alceo
Galliera in Beethoven’s Fourth Piano
Concerto. Nancy’s Christian Dior gown
of pale-gold satin brocade had the square
neckline massed with gold beads and
sequins. In the audience were Signora
Galliera, who wore a platina-fox cape
over a short black evening gown ; Mrs.
Con Charlton, in garnet-red velvet and
brown musquash, and Mrs. John Chald-
jian, who has just returned from overseas,
and who covered her black jersey frock
with a mink coat.
Mrs. Arthur Blakeborough, of Toorak,
was hostess at a small luncheon-party at
the Lyceum Club when the guest-of-honor
was the pianist Vera Bradford. Silver-
fox furs were worn by the hostess with
her black ensemble. Vera wore a green-
blue gaberdine suit and matching hat.
Party was given so that guests might
welcome the pianist back from her five
weeks’ concert tour of New Zealand,
during which she gave a number of con-
certs with the National Symphony Orch-
estra. Vera found Maorilanders enthusi-
astic music-lovers ; in every town there
are amateur choral- and chamber-music-
groups. She found much to extol in the
support given to Douglas Lilburn, a
young composer whose first symphony
was performed while she was there. So
highly does Vera think of the composer’s
work, she intends to include his piano
sonata in her next recital.
Mrs. M. L. Griffith, of Little Hallings-
bury Park, Bishops Stirtford, England,
will judge the red poll cattle at the
Royal Melbourne Commemoration Show
which opens on Sept. 20. Mrs. Griffith
is chairman of the council of the Red
Poll Cattle Society of Great Britain and
Ireland, and is one of the four leading
judges in England. In the U.K., where
the red poll breed is firmly established,
there are many internationally-renowned
herds, including that of his Majesty, at
Sandringham. One of the Red Poll
Society’s treasured possessions is a photo-
graph of the king receiving from the
queen a championship trophy which he
had won with stock from his stud.
Weather was ideal for the M.R.C.’s
meeting at Caulfield, and color-schemes
were as gay as in spring or summer. Mrs.
Norman Lynch wore a frock of dove-
grey wool which had high petal-revers
lined with matching grosgrain; her tiny
black velvet matador-hat flew a black
feather-cockade. Unusual was the black
velvet tent-coat worn by Judith Silk. On
the cuff of one sleeve she had her initials
in brilliants ; her tiny pillbox cap was of
black velvet. Her mother, Mrs. A. G.
Silk, carried a large ocelot muff and wore
a black suit; her black felt helmet was
banded in patent leather and finished with
a feather mount. Mrs. John Rodd’s gold-
toned wool suit was worn with a navy
beret. Mrs. Donald Osborne topped her
slate-blue suit with a wide-brimmed
winter-white melusine hat. Mrs. Alfred
Fowler’s small peaked hat of melusine
was worn with a grey suit edged with
black braid. A gold melusine beret
offset Mrs. Stan Garnsworthy’s black-
braided coat. Mrs. Neil Rogers wore a
grey tent-coat and a small matching hat
finished with white wings.

PERSONAL ITEMS
Rex Rienits, Australian playwright
who joined the overseas colony in
London two years ago, is one of the
scriptwriters for a new series of 8.8. C.
programmes on the earlier life of Harry
Lime, of Graham Greene’s play “The
Third Man.” A television enthusiast,
Rienits recently had success with an
ambitious series called “The Passing
Show,” and a story of his has just been
accepted for filming. Like many other
writers and artists, he lives in Dolphin-
square, that colossal congeries of modern
flats in Pimlico.
The measure of Captain Sir Henry
Gordon, Commodore of the Shaw Savill
Line, is indicated by the speed of his
early rise—from fourth to chief-officer in
under six years. In 1942 he had the
bridge of the 13,000-odd-tonner Wairangi,
in that most savage of Malta-convoy
attacks, when most of the laden supply-
ships, Gordon’s among them, went down
flaming. Gordon got his D.S.C. for that,
and his knighthood two years later. Now,
65, Dominion Monarch’s skipper, he’ll
swallow the shackle on return to England.
The smile on Lambart’s victim, Arthur
Joseph Deakin, may have something to
do with the fact that the other day his
firm, Evans Deakin, saw completed the
trials of its newest baby, the 6000-ton,
£600,000 freighter Borda. Born in
N.S.W., schooled in Perth, young Deakin
first contacted salt-water business with
KEELS.
the A.U.S.N. co. In 1911 he accepted a
proposal from his engineering pal Dan
Evans that they team up and start busi-
ness in Brisbane; from that two-man
effort has grown Queensland’s biggest
engineering and shipbuilding organisa-
tion. Large-framed and jovial, a devotee
of the team spirit, Deakin was a class
oarsman and inter-State footballer in his
day, captained the Royal Queensland
Golf Club for some years, and recently
was voted the Federal presidency of the
Metal Trades Employers’ Association.
Wing-Commander Reginald Burrage,
recently appointed c.o. of 34 Squadron
at Mallala, north of Adelaide, made a
habit of rescuing in War 11. With the
famed Australian-manned No, 10
Sunderland Squadron in 1940, he was
co - pilot of a flying - boat which
sighted an R.A.F. Hudson ditched in the
Bay of Biscay. The Sunderland nosed
down; the Bay was waiting. Heavy
seas smashed into one of her floats and
an engine and knocked both into the
sea. But the Hudson men were picked
up, the Sunderland set off to taxi home,
and 10 days later was picked up by an
R.N. destroyer. Later captain of his own
boat, Burrage got a “mention” for
rescuing another ditched crew. Back in
Australia, flight-commander in No. 11
Catalina Squadron based on Cairns,
Burrage kept busy unloading over the
Jap-held Solomons and New Britain,
until a returning Liberator sighted
three surviving Americans of a crashed
826 bomber who, after 10 months’
privations, had reached the New
Britain coast at Open Bay. Off
went Burrage through a black night,
slid his Cat down on the uncharted
bay and took the thankful trio
aboard. D.F.C. for this. Still sticking
to saltwater, Burrage took command of
No. 76 Flying-boat Wing at Darwin, to
boss the slow and unpleasant job of min-
ing enemy posts in the Philippines, East
Indies and along the China coast. After
the war he took charge of Point Cook,
the station where he had learnt to fly a
short, adventurous seven years before.
Calling it a day, Bertram Dickson,
whose baby, C.5.1.R.0.’s division of plant
industry, has grown into a major research
institute in the 20-odd years he has been
its head. Bora in Leicester (Eng.),
schooled in Canada, he was a botany pro-
fessor at McGill University in Montreal
when he accepted the Australian post in
1927. Notched 65 the other day, he’s an
old-stager in Canberra’s amateur dram-
atics.
Footballers from France:
Puig-Aubert, 26-year-old captain of the visit-
ing French Rugby League team, is regarded as
the finest exponent of the drop-kick since the
war, and is an uncanny handler. In 10 seasons
he has kicked 1200-odd goals, many of them
from the halfway line. Playing first for France
against England in 1946, he had started his
sporting career as an athlete, and won distinc-
tion as a pole-vaulter.
Puig-Aubert is a sturdy nugget of sft. 3in.,
weighs lOst. 101 b., has a nose flattened by fre-
quent hard knocks and is the possessor of a fiery
temperament. He runs a sports store in Rue
de Verdun, Carcassonne, not far from the
Franco-Spanish border, and is married, with
one small daughter of six months old.
The name “Pipette,” by which Puig-Aubert
is familiarly known, means “the wine-taster.”
Until recently he was employed by a firm of
wine merchants.
When the Australian Wine Producers’ Asso-
ciation gave the French team a wine-tasting
buffet in Sydney on Monday of last week they
thoroughly enjoyed the lavish food provided
and the opportunity to sample many different
varieties of Australian wines. Some thought
our sauternes were our best; some liked the
clarets, but all agreed they were very pleasant
wines, some a little lighter than their French
equivalents, some a little heavier.
Another member of the team —Maurice Andre
—is a wine-grower in Narbonne.
Off on leave to renew acquaintance with
the Old Dart, Associate-Professor of
Engineering, H. P. Tuck, boss of amps
and volts in the Speck’s University, Old
Digger with the A.I.F. engineers in
France, he’s been lecturing in electrical-
engineering in Tasmania since 1924, was
for a while recently Dean of the Engineer-
ing Faculty there and uses up his surplus
ergs on the tennis-court.
Westralia’s two new Senators, H. S.
Seward and S. Paltridge, are both Diggers.
Seward began farming in the West in
1913, swapped plough for rifle when the
Kaiser kicked over the traces, served in
the 60th Battalion, in “Pompey” Elliott’s
brigade, first as private, then lieutenant
and adjutant, and entered politics
through Pingelly in the 1933 State election.
Minister for Transport and Railways in
the first McLarty Cabinet, he missed the
train when he stood for Roe at last year’s
State election. A War II 2/7th Field
Artillery gunner, Paltridge learnt his
political pothooks organising the L.C.L.
campaign in the Swan electorate for the
1949 Federal selection. By profession a
publican.
The Royal Australian Naval College
at Flinders identifies its groups of cadets,
according to the year they join, by the
names of naval captains—Jervis, Phillip,
Cook and Flinders, Now four more
captains are to have their memories per-
petuated in four more groups—Burnett
of the Sydney, Waller of the Perth and
Stuart, Getting of the Canberra and
Dechaineux of the Australia. The first
three were lost with their ships ; the last-
named was killed on Australia’s bridge
at Leyte by an exploding suicide-bomber.
“H.”: Two academically distinguished
brothers retired recently in Leslie Allen,
Senior Lecturer-in-Charge of English and
Classics at the University College, Can-
berra (formerly Professor of English at
Duntroon Military College), and
Carleton Allen, Oxford secretary to the
Rhodes Trust and warden of Rhodes
House (formerly Professor of Juris-
prudence in the University). Both went
abroad from Sydney University on travel-
ling scholarships—Carl to Oxford, Les
to Leipzig. Les owns to the authorship of
several collections, Billy Bubbles: Child
Songs, Phcedra and Other Poems, Araby
and Patria and Other Poems; and a
volume of prose, Gods and Wood
Things. He has also translated three
plays of Frederic Hebbel for Everyman's
Library (with which Carl is credited in
the E.L. list), and is preparing For the
Term of His Natural Life for World's
Classics. He’s chairman of the Common-
wealth Literary Censorship Appeals
Board. Carl stayed in England, to be-
come a barrister and a Fellow of Uni-
versity College, Oxford. He also wrote
a novel. The Judgment of Paris, and a
reply to Stephen Leacock’s criticism of
England, entitled Oh, Mr. Leacock! as
well as legal works.
James Hart, who serviced “Smithy’s”
plane when he was running the first
Melbourne-Sydney service, has passed on
at 60. In War I one of the first
regular soldiers to cross to the R.F.C.,
Hart was an air-gunner to Geoffrey de
Havilland’s brother Hereward, and came
to Australia as an engineer with a pioneer
company running joyrides at Fishermen’s
Bend, servicing the old wood-and-fabric
biplanes which cavorted cumbersomely
above where Australia’s jets are now
made. Other “firsts” of his were first
resident-engineer for the Department of
Civil Aviation at Essendon, and first
licensed ground-engineer in Australia,
and he founded the Hart Aircraft Service.
Appointed to the Jury Chair of
English at Adelaide, Dr. A. N. Jeffares

Bonn is an avid collector of antiques and

aesthetic chord in him.
Thirty years ago, Cecil Gregory, a
young journalist on the Bathurst “Times,”
arrived in Sydney to join the “Daily
Telegraph.” He found the streets had a
crazy habit of changing their names every
so often and doubling back on their
tracks with cul-de-sacs and dead-ends
abounding. The newcomer almost wore
his tongue out getting his bearings, so he
decided to compile a Guide to Sydney
CARTOGRAPHY.
for his own use. Written in odd moments
snatched while subbing under Tom Heeney
and W. Farmer Whyte, the Guide found
its way on to the bookstalls and helped
other strangers to make their way from
the Haymarket to the Quay without end-
ing up at Longnose Point. In 1925, when
the N.R.M.A. wanted a capable man to
look after their publicity and touring
departments they coaxed Gregory to join
them. He stayed six years and ran a
series of road maps and guides as a side-
line. In the early 1930’s he branched out
on his own and is now head of Gregory’s
Guide and Maps, publishers of, for the
angler, Gregory’s N.S.W. Fishing Guide,
for the punter, Gregory’s Racegoer's
Ready Reckoner, for the yachtsman,
Gregory’s Map of Sydney Harbor,
and for the homebuilder, Gregory’s
Handbook for Australian Builders.
An amiable citizen in his middle
fifties, interested in hypnotism and psy-
chology, and swimming, golfing and ski-
ing when not prowling about undiscovered
Sydney, Gregory does just about every-
thing to prevent the motorist or pedestrian
from becoming lost short of providing
a team of blacktrackers.
Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 55, Old Digger John
Thomas Alexander, one-time Mayor of Essen-
don. For the past 22 years he had been an
executive member of the Victorian R.S.L., the
last seven as president.
In Brisbane, A. A. Staines, a man who
played many parts in his half-century of public
service—among them, clerk of petty sessions,
mining registrar, public-service inspector and
police magistrate. Before retiring in 1946 he
reached the under-secretaryship for mines.
At 73, at Coolamon (N.S.W.), Dr. Duncan
Buchanan, a Melbourne University-educated
Scot with an intense feeling for the poetry of
his native land. In 1934 he delivered the eulogy
at the opening of the Bums Memorial at Can-
berra. He doctored at Coolamon for 40 years.
In Sydney, at 83, J. J. McWilliam, Grand Old
Man of the Australian wine industry. Born at
Sale (Vic.), grape-student in his father’s Corowa
vineyard, he later started on his own, to pioneer
the present sizeable industry in the Murrum-
bidgee irrigation area, where he grew the first
commercial grapes in 1912. Now McWilliam’s
wines flow from half-a-dozen wineries, that at
Hanwood one of the largest in Australia. Four
sons are carrying on the business.
In Melbourne, a few hours after Field-

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY, I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
Black Disease.
“Rooster”; About 20 years
ago it was shown that this
disease affects only adult sheep
in good condition, and is ob-
served during only the four
autumn months. A sudden
frost or heavy snowfall appears
to stop it. Further, black
disease is dependent upon the
association of a soil organism
(Clostridium cedematiens) with
liver-fluke. Spores of the soil
organism are deposited on grass,
especially if too many sheep are
grazed on the pasture or if the
body of a dead sheep has not
been removed. These spores are
taken in, along with grass, by the
sheep without ill effect, and
some of them eventually get to
the liver and spleen. Here, in
their dormant state, they remain,
the host being unaffected by
them.
The liver-fluke eggs enter the
body of a particular snail (Lim-
ncea truncatula ) living among
the mud and weeds of ditches
and swampy pastures.
Inside the snail the fluke
larva develops for about six
weeks ; then it emerges in a dif-
ferent form, leaves the host,
climbs on to a blade of grass
and becomes encysted like a
spore. This larva is eaten by
a sheep. Inside the bowel the
cyst gives rise to a young fluke
which penetrates the bowel wall
and migrates to the liver. The
tunneling by the young flukes in
the liver tissues causes destruc-
tion ; toxic substances liberated
by the fluke attack surrounding
cells. There follows an intense
activity on the part of the
sheep’s white blood cells, which
form a barrier around the dead
tissue.
Here the spores of the soil
bacteria are stimulated into
activity; the bacteria multiply
rapidly and produce toxins
which prove fatal to the sheep
within a few hours.
Here we have a definite cycle,
but the odds against its comple-
tion were once thought to be
so great that many early scien-
tists were baffled. It took the
courage of conviction to prove
the vague connections and to
prepare a serum. This serum
has saved hundreds of thous-
ands of sheep—a triumph for
the scientist.
Milking-machines.
“Camber”: Milk residues and
sediment become glued to the
equipment if not washed out
immediately after milking.
First, rinse the equipment in
cold or lukewarm water, then
draw through each unit of the
plant a gallon of caustic solu-
tion (a tablespoonful of caustic-
soda to 4gal. of hot water).
For tinned parts never exceed
this strength, and after washing
in the soda rinse immediately in
clean, boiling water, and after-
wards subject them to an appli-
cation of live steam.
Rubber parts require addi-
tional treatment by boiling once
a week in a strong caustic-soda
solution (one tablespoonful in
one gallon of water). These are
best dismantled and placed in a
box with holes bored in it,
specially made for immersion in
the solution. A mixture of this
strength would destroy tinware,
but produces on rubber a
smooth glazed surface which pro-
tects it against action by milk
fats.
Thirsty Sheep.
“Shadow-chaser”: When un-
loading thirsty, overheated sheep
in hot weather, keep them away
from water until they have
cooled down and have had a
chance to get some food into
their empty stomachs. Other-
wise they will become “water
griped,” lie down kicking at their
bellies in agony, and if driven
may die.
The best treatment is to camp
in the shade, away from water,
for an hour or so. They respond
rapidly to rest treatment. In hot
weather, never allow overheated
sheep near water until close up
sundown.
Mastitis.
“M.”: These precautions are
suggested by Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture vets:
Keep to a regular milking-shed
routine, milk rapidly and don’t
allow the degree of vacuum to
exceed 15in. Avoid rough
handling of the udder and don’t
allow the cups to remain too
long in position. Sterilise teats
and tea-cups with warm, soapy
water and by dipping the cups
in a hypochlorite solution for
10 to 20 seconds. (The solution
is made by adding or three
tablespoons of commercial 12
per cent, hypochlorite to a gal-
lon of water).
Use the strip-cup on each cow
at least once a day and leave
milking any cow which shows
the merest suspicion of mastitis
until last. Calves and pregnant
heifers are best separated from
the milkers. When drying
a cow off don’t drag out pro-
ceedings indefinitely by irregu-
lar milkings—terminate milking
abruptly and cut down on the
food. When she’s dried-off,
however, she’ll need more than
a maintenance ration to build
her up for her next calf.
Bone-chewing.
“Clunesman”: Stockmen are
often unaware that mineral
deficiency is present until bone-
chewing is noticed.
Minerals may be lacking even
when no symptoms are seen,
especially when improved stock
are placed on unimproved
pasture, when the land is natur-
ally deficient or when minerals
extracted by grazing are not
returned, particularly in the case
of milking cows and growing
stock.
A chemical soil analysis soon
reveals a shortage of trace
elements, and most of Australian
grazing land needs top-dressing
with super, and/or lime. In
addition calcium and phosphor-
ous supplements and coarse salt
should be placed out in covered
troughs.
Many licks on the market are
expensive, and some are of little
more use than rock-salt. In
addition, the trough method is
generally more economic. There
is no excuse for mineral defi-
ciency in stock on small hold-
ings or on large areas where
drinking water is supplied by
bores ; in the latter case the lick
can be placed in a receptacle
near the water-trough.
The Small Beekeeper.
“A-Jay”: Many people keep
one or two hives of bees for
honey for the family and pol-
lination of their garden plants.
There are others who keep hives
for no apparent object what-
ever, and do not open them
from one year to another. These
neglected hives are a potential
menace to the bee industry,
helping in the spread of such
diseases as American foul-brood.
Many owners of bees do not
understand their management,
and have hives which are diffi-
cult to examine.
Use of foundation-comb will
result in good straight combs
firmly fixed into the frames,
easily removed from the hives
“If Mum don't scare the crows away nothing will.”
without killing bees or causing
any stickiness, and saving the
operator much time and many
stings. For proper management
of hives its use is essential.
Hives can be readily examined,
and, therefore, more frequently,
if so fitted, and American foul-
brood can be detected much
earlier. To obtain the honey the
frames can be lifted but easily
and the bees shaken or brushed
off the comb before it is ex-
tracted or cut out for straining.
If the comb is cut out a new
sheet of foundation should be
fitted before the frame is
returned to the hive.
Poultry Pasture.
“Myrr”: Mixed grasses and
clovers, regularly mown and
kept growing, make a palatable
variation in the poultry diet.
M. D. Hall, in the Victorian
“Journal of Agriculture,” con-
siders that 61b. of greenfeed per
100 birds per day is sufficient,
but the stuff has to be succulent
and of good quality, as indigest-
ible fibre is a common cause of
impaction in the crop.
For the poultry pasture where
there is water Hall recommends
a mixture (parts by weight) of
perennial rye-grass (Colac certi-
fled) 10, cocksfoot three, alsike
clover one, wild white clover
one, subterranean clover (Mt.
Barker) three. Sow in autumn
or early spring, loz. of seed to
five square yards, with loz. of
market-garden manure to the
square yard.
Value of Pines.
“Big Biljy”: Pines of the
radiata-insignis variety do well
in most districts with a rainfall
over 20in. as windbreaks, shel-
ters or as commercial planta-
tions.
The trees transplant easily and
grow quickly. From four to
seven years after planting they
are big enough for windbreaks.
Double-row belts are good,
but five or six rows, or a plan-
tation block, make the best
windbreaks, especially on poorer
land. Permanent low shelters
can be obtained by a combina-
tion of pines and hedge.
They are best not planted with
other trees, but they can be used
as marginal bands in plantations
of different species. In exposed
coastal areas best results come
from planting radiata on the in-
side with the hardier pinaster or
muricata.
Planted in blocks, radiata is
useful in land management to
suppress weeds, utilise rough
country and to control erosion.
Plant Bft. apart in gullies and
inaccessible corners so that
straight growth will be en-
couraged. Pines will check the
THE WEATHER
By Inigo Jones
Prospects are for further rains along the southern portion
of the continent. Along the eastern regions the outlook
is to some extent uncertain, as the southern sunspot group
which at one time seemed very promising has not main-
tained its complex state and may not give the good rains
that at first seemed likely. There are several features
affecting this. First, the great preponderance of the
northern section of the groups, next, the partial fading of
that southern part which concerns us, lastly, the state
of the cycles which show in one some good rains but in the
other practically a dry month. Favorable indications are
the long-maintained solar halo and also- the very fine dis-
plays of cirrus clouds, but neither of these
signs positively indicates approaching rain. The general
sunspot activity still remains high and may produce the
falls now needed to ensure success of the wheat crop.

away. To grow from seed select
from well-shaped cones taken

Ophthalmia.
“A.W.”: Here is a simple cure
for ophthalmia, used over a
period of 45 years. Ordinary
good-quality lighting kerosene is
injected into the eye with a
syringe. When a syringe is not
available take a mouthful and
squirt it into the eye. Keep a
good hold on the beast, because
they get very wary after a dose
or two. I have cured both horses
and cattle with this in all parts
of Queensland,
Apply morning and evening
for the first few days, and when
improvement is noticeable once
a day. The only after-effects of
the disease is a small blue speck
on the eye.
As soon as I feel anything
wrong with my eyes I get some
clean kerosene and drop it in
the eye. I am 70, and my eyes
are still good.
Blackleg Treatment.
“Agric”; In all outbreaks of
blackleg in vaccinated calves to
come under the notice of the
Yeerongpilly Animal Health
Station (Q.) in 1950, a second
dose of vaccine stopped
mortality.
Dr. John Legg thinks it
possible that the disease was un-
usually violent last year—related
perhaps to the abnormal season
—and that the single injection
usually adequate gave in-
sufficient protection. Specimens
from four outbreaks of black-
leg in vaccinated calves were
submitted by field officers of the
Department of Agriculture and
in each instance these contained
the blackleg bacillus.
Cultures were sent to the
Commonwealth Serum Lab-
oratory, Melbourne, which, said
Dr. Legg, had the best experi-
ence and equipment to
determine whether they were
typical blackleg bacilli against
which the vaccine should protect
or whether there was something
unusual about them.
Hints for the Farm.
“Sundowner”: Special care
should be taken in the market-
ing of pigs, as, being non-sweat-
ing animals, they are less able to
stand heat than other livestock.
Don’t hurry them when draft-
ing or unloading. Dispatch them
on empty stomachs and see that
plenty of water is available.
Don’t load the trucks to full
capacity.
“C.A.A.”: If using rye-corn
to stabilise drift let it run wild
for a year or two and don’t
graze it heavily. If the top of
a sandhill is too steep to plant
take the seed up as high as pos-
sible. As the top wears down it
will facilitate complete cover-
age of the ridge with corn. Three
simple rules for control of wind-
erosion: Keep soil covered as
much as possible by stubble;
never cultivate in a high wind
or while land is dry; cultivate
only to kill weed-growth and not
at high speed.
“Big Billy”: To check the
wir, 3 of a plough-share place an
Sin. board on level ground and
pull the plough over it with front
and rear furrows on the board.
Let down the levers until the
points of the shares just touch
the board. A look along the
board will show if the wings are
too low.
“H.”; When cabbages and
cauliflowers are being troubled
with cabbage-fly and aphides, a
good rule to observe is to dust
in wet weather and spray in dry
weather.
“M.”; If growth of leaf crops
slackens before maturity, work
into the soil loz. per square yard
of sulphate of ammonia not
closer than sin. or 6in. from the
stems of the plants. Another
way to administer the stimulant
is to mix loz. of the fertiliser
to a gallon of water and, when
thoroughly dissolved, water it
around the roots, taking care
not to splash the leaves.
“Hortus”: When sowing seeds
of carrots, parsnips, beetroot and
turnips always give them a wet
start. Make a shallow drill and
then run along a watering-can
and make the soil nicely damp.
Use super, and wood-ash to help
on the root-growth immediately
the small seeds germinate.
“Waverly”: Liver disease in
fowls is indicated by paleness of
comb and face and a listless
appearance. Affected birds are
apt to overrun their food ; often
they stumble and fall. Feed on
oats or wheat soaked in lime-
water. Provide ample green
food, and dissolve small quan-
tities of Epsom salts in the drink-
ing water —loz. of salt in three
pints of water to 20 fowls.

AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
By way of refreshing change from
the eternal round of metropolitan
meetings, this page last week in-
dulged in a couple of days’ peaceful
rustication in the Richmond-Windsor
district (N.S.W.) for the reopening of
historic Clarendon racecourse by the
no less venerable Hawkesbury Race
Club. Paying tribute to the 1951
milestone of Australian history, the
meeting was designated the Jubilee
Meeting, but Clarendon was old
when Federation was very young, and
the thoroughbred had a keen fol-
lowing thereabouts long before the
Iron Horse nosed its way into the
district.
Nevertheless, the Sydney-Richmond
railway is one of the oldest in the
land. In about a hundred minutes it
takes one a good hundred years into
the past and (or, at least, so it
seems) as many miles from the
noisy city. It was obviously in-
tended to end at Richmond, where
it runs into a dead-end platform, but
evidently ages later, after the town
had grown and spread far beyond the
terminus, it was decided to extend
the line to Kurrajong. So now it
starts off again from the other side
of the platform, barges out straight
across the pavement and the street,
meanders through the park (carefully
avoiding the oval), strikes another
street and disappears down it out of
the town. Altogether there is a rare
antiquity about Richmond. Its
splendid old colonial buildings be-
long to other days. So for that
matter does the encountering of a
hostelry where a splendid table and
genuine hospitality are no less readily
dispensed than the spirituous and fer-
mented.
First official port of call on the
Hawkesbury jaunt was Richmond
Airdrome —one of the R.AA.F.’s
largest permanent establishments —
for the somewhat surprising purpose
of attending what proved to be the
best night’s bill of stoush we’ve
sighted in quite a time. These “fight
nights” held in the station gym. are
a regular institution; proceeds go to
the airmen’s amenities fund, and the
local citizenry roll up in force. They
get a cracking good spin for their
money. Boxing is under amateur
rules, with bouts of three two-minute
rounds, and it’s fast, furious and
willing all the way. The principal
fare last week was a series of bouts
between Richmond troops and a team
from Rathmines, another big
R.A.A.F. establishment. Between
fights they turn on sundry vaude-
ville items and the priceless spectacle
achieved by letting loose in the ring
for a couple of rounds a dozen or so
of the local smallfry, blindfolded and
wearing gloves as big as themselves;
the kids drew a “shower” that senior
preliminary boys would envy. Cus-
tomary winding-up item of fight
night, and the real highlight of the
evening, is a full-scale professional ex-
hibition of the grunt-an’-groan game,
with the station’s pride, Bernie Tap-
lin, taking on any challenger within
half a ton of his own weight. Bernie,
who is Warrant-Officer Taplin of the
R.A.A.F., is also light-heavyweight
champion of the Australian profes-
sional ring. His intended victim last
week was leading contender for the
title Ken Hawthorne, who is a peda-
gogue by profession and would be a
devastating sight seen from the
receiving end of a “sixer.” Ken
proved a suitably unwilling victim,
and the result was a draw.
And so to the ’osses.
The grounds for Clarendon race-
course were set aside by the Govern-
ment of the day in 1866 and the
Hawkesbury Race Club, a non-pro-
prietary concern, was established by
Act in 1890; but there had been rac-
ing in the vicinity very many years
earlier than either date. Indeed it is
quite on the cards that the renowned
Admiral Rous, later famed for the
thorough job he did of setting the
English turf firmly on its feet,
counted visits to Windsor and Rich-
mond among his earlier turf experi-
ences. While he was here in the
1820’s Rous was a keen racing man,
and round that period we find “the
Killarney course, near Richmond,”
described as “the most beautiful in
the colony.”
That description, or its modern
equivalent, may be again applicable
to Clarendon if the present commit-
tee and its youthful secretary, Allan
Frost, press on vigorously with the
plans they have formed. Certainly
they are off to a good start, and in
the right direction. With a great
deal still to be done, the course,
nevertheless, looked splendid last
week; a mile ahead of any of the
other provincial tracks. The general
layout and appearance of horse-stalls
and the saddling area have something
to show most metropolitan tracks.
And the club has evidently had the
good fortune to have had in the past
officials in whom the sight of an
Australian native tree in its natural
surroundings inspired artistic appre-
ciation instead of an itching to get
hold of an axe.
As to the general organisation and
running of the meeting, it was, despite
a few small upsets caused by sheer
bad luck, a credit to young Frost,
and as far ahead of the prevailing
standard at other provincial tracks
as are the appearance and facilities
of the course. True, a number of
things were not quite as they should
be, but it will be time for criticism
if matters have not been righted after
another meeting or two. The next
meeting is down for June 20.
According to the official figure,
some 9000 folk paid their way into
Clarendon. The figure, we are told,
would have been considerably higher
if officials had been a bit quicker at
shutting a gate which they had
openea to admit the official veterinary
surgeon.
As to the actual racing, a good
time appeared to have been had by
all except the bookmaking fraternity.
A string of winning favorites, includ-
ing three even-money pops, brought
joy to the general run of punters,
while knowledgeable local citizens
cleaned up handsomely when a
couple of nags with local affiliations
scored at the very juicy odds avail-
able by the time well-heeled visitors
had finished backing their animals.
Indeed, there was a tale told of a
couple of teachers being allowed to
leave school a trifle early in order to
place the school commission, but of
course that couldn’t have been true.
♦ * * *
If, as we have mooted, the subse-
quent Admiral Rous did go a-racing
round Clarendon, and if perchance he
had been able to revisit the scene last
week, surely nothing would have
astonished him more than the sight
and sound of bookies shattering the
rustic colonial air with their version
of the odds on the English Derby to
be run that selfsame night; and the
said bookies being besieged by
punters who would know the result
’ere the next morning. Rous would
need have waited many a month to
learn Frederick had won the 1829
Derby ridden, incidentally, by a
jockey over 60 years of age.
The books operating on the Derby
last week must have had a tidy clean-
up. Aside from the pick-’em-with-a-
pin experts, local punters were in-
terested only in the favorite and the
half-dozen horses ridden by Australian
jockeys. The subsequent success of
the 33-to-l chance, Arctic Prince,
ridden by C. Spares, who was having
his first ride in the Derby, provided
a setback for followers of the local
hoops and yet another Derby disap-
pointment for English breeders. How-
ever, for the last-named the pill was
not quite so bitter this year as with
the overpowering French successes of
recent years; this year’s winner at
least speaks the language, or a rea-
sonable facsimile thereof. Irish-bred
Arctic Prince scored the easiest of
wins with six lengths to spare as he
passed the post running away from
them. Runner -up was Sybil’s
Nephew, who just shaded Signal Box,
the only other Irish starter apart
from the winner. There was a near-
record field of 33 runners, with Ki
Ming favorite at nines, and the
winner’s time was 2.39 f.
English punters came another thud
over the Oaks, which went to the
33-to-l chance Neasham Belle;
Breasley’s mount, Chinese Cracker,
was second and the favorite, Bell of
All, third. The results of the classic
double represented a triumph for the
sire Nearco. Neasham is by Nearco
and Arctic Prince is out of the
Nearco mare Arctic Sun. English
breeders didn’t altogether escape the
inference of French superiority.
Arctic Prince comes of the first crop
of Prince Chevalier, who was foaled
and did his racing in France.

Principal item of interest at Rand-
wick on Saturday was the introduction
to that course of the doubles tote,
whereat Sydney doubles bookmakers
had best start making plans for the
future. The new machine was
operated on only two chosen doubles
on Saturday, but it will gradually be
worked up to a continuous operation
on a this-and-the-next basis. Aside
from the tote the highlight of pro-
ceedings was jockey A. Ward’s elfort
of landing three winners and two
close seconds from eight races.
Ward won the second Two-
year-old on Trizami, the Flying on
the Ajax filly Ajanni and the June
Novice on another of the Ajax breed
in Mr. Ajax. Near misses for Ward
were Niaranga, who was just beaten
by Golden Wedge in the George’s
River Handicap, and Duke of Syke,
beaten three-parts of a length by Lady
Shuna in the Welter. In other events
J. Thompson landed a double, taking
the Three-year-old Novice on Kee-
land and the Homestead Handicap on
Wanfield.
* * * ♦
At Caulfield the favorites bit the
dust with woeful regularity; in fact,
only two of the allegedly good things
managed even to fill a minor place in
the course of seven events. Probably
the most painful failure for most
punters was that of Benarca in the
M.R.C. Steeple; he finished out of
a place, Worrowing (B. R. Smith)
winning narrowly from Tanakee, with
Bronze Laddie third. Dire things
were muttered concerning Ron Hall’s
tactics in trying to lead all the way
on Benarca, who was burdened with
topweight of 12.7, but there seemed
little that Hall could do about it. At
all events, Benarca would need to run
considerably worse races before he
could be dismissed as a Grand
National prospect. Fairy Fable (J.
Kennedy) won the M.R.C. Hurdle,
20-to-l chance Tamahine (H. Mc-
Kenzie) the 12-furlongs Springvale
Handicap and Winlake (G. West), at
10 to 1, the 6-furldngs Waverley
Handicap.

“Pass-it”: Sydney club matches'
were suspended last Saturday while
the second Rugby Union “Test” be-
tween New Zealand Universities and
Australian Universities was played at
North Sydney Oval. With their for-
wards dominating the play in scrums,
rucks and lineouts, N.Z. was un-
troubled to win 27-17. The winning
margin was hardly indicative of the
real superiority of the New Zea-
landers, who scored six tries to one
and created many opportunities for
others which were only prevented
from materialising by remarkable
courage in the Australians’ defence.
The New Zealanders followed the All
Black tradition of setting about their
task with solid determination and
taking no unnecessary risks. By
good positioning they played un-
hurriedly but always purposefully;
each member of the team was well
versed in the fundamentals of
handling, running and tackling—a
noticeable feature of all teams com-
ing from New Zealand. Although
on the defensive for most of the
match, the Australians, in contrast,
vacillated between sheer brilliance and
utter crudity—which pretty fairly typi-
fies the general brand of football
played in this country.

Surprise of Saturday’s V.F.L. round
was the outcome of visit
to Hawthorn; ’Scray just couldn’t get
functioning properly, and Hawthorn
doggedly battled its way to a 9.16-
7.17 victory. Richmond scraped home
ahead of St. Kilda 19.12-18.9, Fitzroy
finished all over Essendon 14.7-9.14,
Melbourne broke the ice by downing
Carlton 11.12-8.10, Collingwood
tossed Sowth 13.15-6.10, and North
Melbourne, in every sense of the
phrase, went down to Geelong, who
booted 12.16 to 11.8. The “four”
underwent another reshuffle. Now it’s
Richmond with 20 points leading Fitz-
roy (20) on percentages; Collingwood
and Geelong complete the four with
16 points apiece, while Footscray,
also with 16 points, just misses out
on the percentages.

Although allegedly at a disadvan-
tage in the weights, Johnny Gleeson
(8.1) proved much stronger than Mel-
bourne bantamweight Ron Wilson
(8.5£) at Leichhardt last week. Wil-
son started like a sure winner, but
Gleeson’s superior strength gradually
wore down the Melbournite, who,
after stopping some corkers in the
fourth round, was unable to come
out for the fifth. In the supporting
12-rounder Ted Sprouster (8.13 i)
made a welcome reappearance after
at least a year’s absence from Leich-
hardt; Sprouster stopped Barney
Murray (9st.) in the ninth round.


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
per line; all others 21d. per line.
Education Surpluses
What does the Commonwealth Office
of Education do? It has, I understand,
little or nothing to do with the education
of cadets in the naval, military and air-
force colleges, all of which are presum-
ably educational institutions in which a
Commonwealth Office of Education
might be expected to function. At one
time I gathered that its business was the
distribution of Dr. Evatt’s speeches about
Indonesia, Malaya, etc., to schools. For
obvious reasons it cannot do that now.
It can, and does, however, send out
leaflets and posters about transport, coal-
mines, wheat, recruiting and whatnot.
The number of large, beautifully-
colored posters arriving in schools almost
every week is such that, if they were
posted up “in a prominent place,”
requested, they would, in less than 12
months, cover the whole internal and
external surface of most schools several
times over.
Whether the cultural reaction of
miscellaneous posters on children is good
or bad, and whether the wholesale exhibi-
tion of posters is likely to conflict with
the aims of the present art-for-apprecia-
tion lunacy, are. of course, moot points.
As matters stand at present it is impos-
sible to exhibit more than a fraction of
the posters, because notice-board space
is limited and it is difficult to push
drawing-pins into brick walls.
A use could be found for them. With
sufficient glue the leaflets and posters
could be glued together into sheets of,
say, 6ft. by 4ft. and when a sufficient
supply had been accumulated they could
be used to make walls for new class-
rooms.
The surplus of posters and booklets is
only one of our educational surpluses —
others are too many children, too many
psychological tests, too many wandering
specialists and too many late school-
buses. If we take a comprehensive view
of the whole situation, those surpluses
might be regarded as balancing the lack
of teachers and the shortage of class-
rooms and school furnishings and equip-
ment. — Hebridean (W.A.).
Inflation
What is being done to counteract the
inflationary trend of prices? The “ordi-
nary working man,” as usual, is getting
more than his share of the blame. Our
daily papers point an accusing finger at
him while comparing current production
figures with pre-war figures. The workers
themselves —or some of them —strengthen
the case of their accusers by their
industry-disrupting strikes and stoppages.
On the other hand, economist Cohn
Clark says “Australian management must
take a share of the blame, and also the
Australian Governments tor extending
manufacturing in a great variety of fields,
in which it has little chance of success,
instead of concentrating on the few in-
dustries with best prospects, as Canada
and New Zealand have done.”
But poor production is only one cause
of inflation, and during the last election
campaign we heard speeches from both
sides which made it plain to anyone who
cared to analyse them that neither party
was prepared to present to us a definite
deflationary plan.
Theoretically, price-control would be
ineffective, but can we hope for a fall in
prices while we have more money con-
stantly being pumped into circulation
through national defence and develop-
ment schemes? No loyal Australian
wants to see his country go undefended
or undeveloped, so it is up to the Govern-
ment to find some other way of decreas-
ing the amount of money spent. It could
reduce the strength of the civil service,
which has now reached the staggering
figure of 650,000 —which, in effect, means
that there is one civil servant for every
1.3 productive factory workers.
Economist Clark claims that “100,000
redundant employees could be released
from public administration (excluding the
“It's much more economical to buy the large family-size bottle , madam."
forces, teachers and trading services).”
Would any party dare invoke the dis-
satisfaction of 100,000 workers and their
friends?
The problem really is: Apart from the
budget-bound housewife and those few
workers .earning the basic wage, who
wants inflation to stop?
The workers earning large wages can
afford to pay high prices and still have
a little to squander. Investors are
thrilled with their large dividends. When
it comes to paying high prices for goods
everyone screams: “Inflation.” But how
gleefully they all grab for their cut.
L. F. W. (Q.).
“Too Old’ at 65”
“Laetitia” (B. 9/5/’5l) ably expresses
the centuries-old attitude of “indus-
try” to the employee. Because 50 p.c. of
all employees are still good for another
five years’ service, and a better proposi-
tion than the 17-year-old of today, “L.”
would condemn the oldster to servitude
for life.
The expectation of life for a 65-year-old
is around six years if a male, slightly
more for a female. Surely they are en-
titled to a few years’ rest and contempla-
tion between the workshops and the grave.
If all unnecessary production were
eliminated, or greatly curtailed, there
would be no need to exploit that aged
pool of labor. The care, not the ex-
ploitation, of the aged is, or should be,
one of the first claims on industry and
humanity.
To head off inflation, some regimenta-
tion of both capital and labor seems in-
evitable. But who is to decree what is,
or what is not, to be produced, and who
is, and who is not, to produce the essen-
tial goods? It seems to be too big a job
for our politicians. But to ask the aged
to continue in harness till they drop, in
the interests of industry, dividends and
our false standard of living, is obnoxious
alike to commonsense and common
humanity.—J. M. (Vic.),
Forty-four Hours
Reversion by industry generally to the
44-hour week, suggested by a prominent
employers’ representative in Sydney,
would certainly increase production
enormously, put the brake on inflation
and stabilise prices, but, until Mr.
Menzies has dealt constitutionally with
the Communists, any attempt to lengthen
the working week now would almost as
certainly make the strike-happy key
unions controlling coal, iron and shipping
drop tools on the spot.
Plainly those extra four hours should
never have been deleted until the nation s
larder had been thoroughly replenished
after the war. But employers, by their
negative resistance to the untimely
measure, were as much to blame as were
employees in their shortsighted resolve to
work less at a time when they should have
worked more. It would be difficult, of
course, to persuade the average unionist
that, so far, he has lost on the deal. As
for any serious attempt to re-establish
the longer working week, I believe the
unions would not be alone in resisting it;
many manufacturers and large retailers,
working to the quota system of market-
ing their goods, are actually better off
under the unnecessary “demand-exceeds-
supply” set-up.
Incidentally, N. S. Wales is not without
a precedent for lengthening its working-
week. In 1921, when it was generally
accepted that the State could ill-afford
such luxury, the courts repealed the 44-
hour week granted immediately after the
Kaiser’s War and restored for about two
years the contentious four hours. Neither
bitter nor concerted opposition met this
action.
Perhaps, like the Russian idols of the
local Commos, Australian workers may
yet acknowledge the crying necessity to
produce more by working longer, or, alter-
natively, harder. But the case must be
put fairly and squarely to them, and the
understanding clearly given by the courts
that the recognised standard of 40 hours
will be quickly restored when the oppor-
tune lime arrives.—P. O. M. C. (N.S.W.).
“Honest Thinking”
Where “the individualist, the man with
the astringent mind” has gone I know not
(B. 11/4/’5l), but the reasons for his going
are plain. Today we are in the midst
of the mechanical age, even to our reason-
ing. Motion-pictures think for us, radio,
television and syndicated world news
agencies speak for us, ingenious machines,
from electric shavers to bulldozers, work
for us and drugs of infinite variety prob-
ably save our sanity.
Even the monetary system is mechanised
—the regimentation of human labor by
the machine has been raised to the degree
whereat living standards may be calcu-
lated to the last shilling of wages earned,
while every shilling of capital invested
returns slightly more to the investor than
it did 25 years ago in spite of rocketirig
costs. For the machine is fast eliminating
the artisan in the true sense of the term,
and when the demand or necessity for in-
dividual skill deteriorates in any given
employment, the real return to workers as
individuals within that trade naturally
decreases. Let wages soar to the sky,
the “gain” to the wage-earners remains
unreal, since the upward trend of wages
is controlled or countered by prices always
to the slight advantage of the employer,
not the employed. Trade-unionists stead-
fastly refuse to accept this fact, otherwise
in their efforts to improve their lot the
emphasis would be on better conditions
rather than on wages.
“An air of corruption and deceit seems
to pervade our daily lives” because,
absurdly enough, the easier the world’s
work is done the sterner the individual’s
battle for existence becomes. This
universal resorting to deception is mani-
fest even in the arts; surrealism or
modernism, particularly in poetry, paint-
ing and sculpture, is nothing but corrup-
tion of the orthodox or genuine for sheer
want of conscience, feeling and skill.
Children are now regarded less as indi-
viduals than numbers in our schools, their
minds being trained more as cogs or parts
in a mechanical system than as entities
in themselves. This is no fault of their
teachers ; it is merely the result of the
modern demand for mass production
carried to the very foundations of
society, primary education.
And as the cult of hypocrisy and
paganism progresses so the gulf between
man and God widens. Here we tread on
contentious ground; God as a term or
meaning has many interpretations accord-
ing to creed and individual conscience.
But, though not a religious man in the
accepted sense, I do believe that the con-
temporary drift from Christianity reflects
the spiritual poverty of our times. There-
fore “Fradelle’s” plea to cease “crippling
our country and ourselves” remains the
prerogative of every man or individual.
It rests with each and all of us to check
the “devil-take-the-hindmost” spirit of
the age simply by returning to the diffi-
cult proposition we first attempted to
solve in childhood—to do unto others as
we would have done unto ourselves. —
