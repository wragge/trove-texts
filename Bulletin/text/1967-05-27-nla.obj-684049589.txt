We like Hong Kong so much we go there every day. Step aboard in Sydney,
San Francisco, Honolulu or Manila and guess where you’re headed for. Hong Kong.
There’s only one way to avoid it. Get off the plane in time. Fortunately,
between Sydney and Hong Kong, being specialists in The East, we offer 65
different places to do just that. Starting with Manila. And ending up with
HONG
Zamboanga. Only one problem. It isn’t that easy
to get off. Because we fly with everything from
French pastry to classical music on the way. We
figure we’ve got you hooked once you get to Manila,
Because Hong Kong is only $4O away. Although
$9.65 to Baguio, return, is pretty enticing, too!

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
As conspicuous as
a negro at a
KKK picnic
THE WORD FROM London is that
there is now a male Twiggy, Bill
Chenail. His measurements are very
similar to Twiggy’s, except that he is
two inches more around the chest,
33-26-33 J, and his hair is longer. He
looks terribly emaciated, like an Indian
Swami.
Bill’s model agency says: “Like
Twiggy, he is exactly right for his time.
What are wanted now are thin, bony,
frightened-looking people, not self-
confident, beefy chaps, smoking pipes.”
Your correspondent has just had
several days with the Easybeats, and
judging from the aforesaid report they
are precisely right for their time. They
are superbly emaciated and frightened-
looking and they have a good harvest
of pimples. They vary in age from 18
to 20, but they look years younger.
They wear the very latest in in
Regency gear. They have dark frock
coats that come almost to the knees,
lace cravats with pearl stickpins, bell-
bottomed trousers, and half-boots. They
are emaciated, long-haired, and pimply.
The effect is quite startling. They look
exactly like one of those characters out
of Dickens drawn by Cruikshank or
Phiz.
Just to fill you in on essential de-
tails, the Easybeats are a Sydney group.
They went to England, toured Europe,
hit the tops of the charts with a record
titled “Friday On My Mind,” and now,
according to the P.R. teams, this disc
is well on its way to making a million
dollars.
Teenagers, when they go into a
trance, think mostly of Little Stevie,
born December 20, 1948, in Leeds, Eng-
land, height sft. 7in., weight Bst. 71b.
When your correspondent found him,
he was drinking beer out of a can and
wearing a saffron-colored shirt with
Basque sleeves. The same color is worn
by novice Buddhist monks and it is also
painted on the tails of airliners to
frighten away other airliners.
“The reception here,” he said, “has
been just marvellous. In Europe they’re
quieter, more adult. They listen to what
you are playing and clap at the end.
Here they just scream from beginning
t 0 end. We even lose track of what
We re playing half the time.” He was
wistfully sad about this, but not ap-
palled.
And did the fans make any particular
demonstrations of devotion?
“Do they ever!” said Little Stevie.
“Our biggest problem is we come back
to our hotel rooms and find ’em full
of birds. Even get birds in the bath-
room. They’ll do anything; dress up as
waitresses. In Perth they all crawled
into my room through the fanlight.”
And Little Stevie told in wonder of
the girl in Brisbane who had Herself
all tied up in a parcel and delivered
to Lennons Hotel. They first became
suspicious when they noted little holes
through the paper for air. Because of
all this the girl was, apparently, en-
titled to a sort of “E” for effort. They
gave her free tickets to the show and
took her to lunch.
In Melbourne for weeks before the
grand arrival, news of the Easybeats
was pumped out over 3UZ. The Easy-
beats fan club was contacted, fan mem-
bers received circulars as to the exact
time of arrival at Essendon, flags were
distributed, there were balloons and a
great sign was placed right across the
air terminal: WELCOME HOME,
EASYBEATS. Actually, only 300 fans
turned up and only two girls had to
be manhandled by the police. It was
all rather disappointing.
The biggest turn was at the Stadium
in Rushcutter’s Bay, in Sydney. Here
there were 7000 fans waiting, and at
least 75 percent of them female. They
had flags, balloons, streamers, great
signs, WE LOVE YOU STEVIE, and
there were girls in white shirts covered
with passionate messages to Little
Stevie, Dick, Harry, George, and
Snowy.
Before the show Little Stevie said he
shook with nervousness before he went
on and it was easy to see why. The
climax was near. Tony McLaren, of
2UW, took the microphone: “We are
about to bring up the five great guys.
This is their home. They haven’t for-
gotten ANY of YOUUUU. The
loyalty of you fans put the Easybeats
where they are today. Let’s hear how
much you want to hear them.”
Then started their shrill teenage
female noise. It was just like the noise
from a very sick engine in the test bed
at Essendon. From then on it never
stopped. The scream was there through
every number and it was impossible to
identify different tunes. This was
despite the extremely impressive nature
of their equipment. For their three
guitars they had three amplifiers.
One of them had eight speakers
and an output of 210 watts. Nobody
sat. They jumped up and down, ran
back and forth to the aisle. The great-
est excitement came during the play-
ing of “Friday On My Mind.” Little
Stevie was enormously impressive. Not
only did he sing, he shook, he vibrated,
he shuddered, and with his hands and
fingers extended he made high-speed
quivering movements, like someone suf-
fering from electric shock or on the
farthest extremity of delirium tremens.
The excitement built and built. Some
girls tugged at their own hair or just
sat there with three or four fingers in
their mouths. One felt very out of place
without a “I Love You Stevie” shirt,
and not being able to make a 707
scream made one evilly conspicuous
like a negro at a KKK picnic.
Toward the finish there was a general
rush from all sides, straight for the
stage. Police, security men, red-coated
chuckers-out locked arms like the
heroes of Waterloo and threw back
the onslaught. Then, everywhere one
looked, girls seemed to be fainting.
And as the Easies were rushed off
stage by strong-armed henchman hun-
dreds of girls began to sob. Two sitting
by me sobbed on their mother’s shoulder
and were still sobbing five minutes after
the show was over.
Just to get the record straight it
seemed wise to call on the St. John
Ambulance men. Officer Bourke said
it was the biggest night since the
Beatles. During the first session he
treated 12 girls for fainting and another
two had to be taken to St. Vincent’s
Hospital.
“I couldn’t do anything with those
two,” he said. “They got out of control
and they were hitting their heads on
the floor. It’s a curious business. This
thing happens with girls aged 14 to 17.
Some get so wild they attack you with
fists. It starts usually with their hitting
their own sides, then they pull their
hair, hit their heads with their hands,
and next they pass out on the floor. Just
this tremendous build-up of emotion.”
Of course, it would be very nice to
give you a sound music criticism of the
Easybeats. But once one is over 25
something very odd happens to the ear-
drums, making it impossible to appre-
ciate the full beauty of the guitar sound
magnified 1000 mega times.

Another of Mr.
Hauser's health
secrets gets out
BY DAPHNE GUINNESS
IT LOOKED, at first, as if his hotel
had mislaid Mr. Gayelord Hauser,
nautical blazer and all. In fact, he had
gone over the road for breakfast for a
change. Mind you, the eggs needed a
touch of Instant Spike Dee-licious Sea-
soning containing 27 spices and flavors,
which he happened to have on him,
otherwise “it was the best food yet.”
The world’s most eminent authority
on health and beauty diets had only
been in Australia a few days but al-
ready he noticed an abundance of
pimples and blotchy complexions in
Sydney. It is all that filthy carbohy-
drate that does it. However, in order
to withstand the perils of foreign travel
Mr. Hauser has brought 201 b. of bottled
vitamins which he carries lovingly over
one shoulder in a large satchel specially
made for the purpose in Italy. Where,
incidentally, he lives. He has another
house in Beverly Hills, but poof! that’s
nothing.
So, rattling round his next port of
call, India (nutrition lectures in India),
he will take Acidophilus against infec-
tion of the intestines, four Vitamin E
a day against heart attack, four Vita-
min B 6 if he’s got a strenuous day
ahead, four Vitamin C if he feels a
cold coming on, safflower oil capsules
if he’s not getting enough salad dress-
ing, garlic capsules for Kashmir, where
he will live on a houseboat, and in
the event of an emergency he has Vita-
min Complete, which is exactly what
it says and looks very nice.
All this talk about vitamins reminds
him of a beautiful experience he had
in the English seaside town of Brighton.
Not just that the English are marvellous
to lecture to, sitting politely with knees
together and hands on lap, but he met
the famous Barbara Cartland, who
writes love stories for frustrated ladies.
“At last,” she cried, “at last I meet
the most darling man in the world,”
and flung her arms around him. She,
too, downs vitamins by the ton.
Actually, Mr. Hauser’s sex appeal is
something he takes for granted, even at
72, “. . . of course women follow me.

They followed Jesus, he was a leader
” gut rich? certainly not! Perhaps
he’s got a million. He comes from a
large family, half of whom are in
heaven, and the rest think he is nuts.
But to return to Sydney. He’d had
some wonderful publicity. Pictures and
stories. No, he didn’t like that picture
with his hands on his forehead. Show
us how you keep your neckline young,
Mr. Hauser, said those photographers,
and he’d put up his hands and pushed
out his jaw and they took it. Ah, well.
He was always telling his manager, Mr.
Frey Brown, who has been with him for
38 years and looks exhausted, not to
get upset over the bad ones.
Mr. Brown disappeared without a
word to discuss Press arrangements with
Mr. George Hawkes, the Australian end
of publicity. An envelope appeared
under Mr. Hauser’s door. “Ha! You
see? Mysterious message.” It is from
“The Sydney Morning Herald’s” Data,
with a clipping to prove it. Would he
kindly explain how he manages his food
travelling round the world? That’s
the sort of intelligent question he likes
and rarely gets. Well, first of all there
are his 201 b. of vitamins, then he buys
fruit, and also he can divide people
who entertain him into two categories:
those who eat intelligently like himself,
and those who say, “Huh, who does he
think he is? He’ll eat what he’s given”
Well, he doesn’t. He pushes anything
offensive to one side and dives into the
salad. It is important not to get fat,
slapping his stomach, or how could he
carry on?
. . then there’s Don Lane, who
wants him on his show,” says Mr.
Hawkes.
“Who’s Don Lane?”
“He does funny things. You know.
Jokes.”
“Shall we do it?”
Mr. Hauser did “Coast to Coast” in
America three times a week live. That
probably sounded nothing to us, but
it was killing to him. Sure, Mr. Hawkes
understood. He’d done a lot of tele-
vision himself. OK. Do Don Lane.
And ABC for two minutes. And Stuart
Wagstaff he’s the best interviewer
in the business. OK. Do that, says Mr.
Brown, now in need of a stiff dose of
Vitamin Complete. But what can Mr.
Hauser say to the ABC in two minutes?
What? Two minutes is an honor, sir.
It’s usually 60 seconds.
Mr. Hawkes was about to divulge
his television experience when Mr.
Hauser said that that was enough and
opened the door. He wished no one
had seen the copper bracelet on his
wrist. Some friends gave it to him
in London “to ward off all illness.”
It was a lot of nonsense. “Look —I
broke my back Jast year, look .” His
head ducked hnd he executed a perfect
touch-the-floor with his hands.
AH the same, the bracelet stays an-
other week. He promised.

ON THE
MARGIN
On being extremely
tactful about
Sir Thomas More
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
RELIGIOUS DENOMINATIONS are
very polite to each other now. This is
a good thing, but it makes life more
dull. A case in point is the film “A Man
For All Seasons” about Sir Thomas
More. When I saw it I thought: “Gosh,
the Church of England will have some-
thing to say about this!” But so far as
I know the Church has not uttered a
peep.
It is left to me, a non-member, to
point out that “A Man For All Seasons”
gives a questionable account of a rather
important event in Church of England
history. I refer to the breakaway from
the Church of Rome by King Henry
VIII.
The film conveys a strong impression,
first, that this breakaway was wrong,
and, second, that it happened solely
because it suited the King’s personal
convenience. We are shown that he
wanted to divorce Queen Catherine,
who could not provide him with a male
heir, and marry Anne Boleyn. The Pope
would not give him a divorce, so Henry
took over the English Church and
divorced himself. Good Sir Thomas
More remained loyal to the Pope,
refused to recognise Henry as head of
the Church, and as a result had his
head cut off. In the film it is as simple
as that.
The only supporters of Henry we
are permitted to see are a few comically
sycophantic courtiers and villainous
politicians. There is no suggestion that
in making the break from Rome, Henry
had the backing of most of the country.
But, in fact, he had—that was why he
got away with it.
Irritation over certain activities of the
Roman Church, such as the sale of
pardons, had been simmering in Eng-
land for a long time. (Chaucer satirically
described a Pardoner with wallet “full
of pardons come from Rome all hot.”)
Tudor businessmen were itching to get
their hands on the big monastery estates.
And, most important, the English spirit
of to - hell - with - the - Continent was
already well developed.
It is true that Henry wanted the
divorce above all else. He was very
excited about Anne he concluded a
pre-marital letter to her: “Wishing
myself, especially of an evening, in my
sweetheart’s arms, whose pretty dukkys
(i.e., breasts) I trust shortly to kiss”
and he was desperately anxious for a
son. But he was no fool, and in taking
the audacious course of a breach with
Rome he calculated correctly that the
country would accept it. Incidentally,
Anne Boleyn, who played hard-to-get
with Henry, was less pretty and prob-
ably had more character than the eager
belle depicted by Miss Vanessa Red-
grave.
The hero of “A Man For All Seasons”
is Sir Thomas More. The film's
admiring portrait is truthful but not
quite the whole truth. He was, indeed,
a fascinating man, of great integrity
and brilliant intellect as the actor
Paul Scofield expertly represents him.
But blended with More’s culture was a
fanatic streak (he at one time wore a
hair shirt) and he had his share of the
religious intolerance common in his
day.
He was a denouncer of heretics. The
film slightly hints at this, but does not
mention that during More’s time as
head of the Government several Prot-
estants were burned at the stake. The
degree of his responsibility has been
disputed, but certainly there was no
such persecution under his predecessor,
Cardinal Wolsey.
I have a weak spot for the much-
maligned Cardinal. He was a shameless
racketeer, who held a dozen bishoprics
at once, but he put up the glorious
buildings of Christ Church at Oxford,
and also was said to be kind to the
poor. One of the likable things about
Wolsey is that he was too busy scheming
and making money, and too bored with
religious controversy, and possibly too
good-natured, to burn anyone alive.
Altogether, “A Man For All Seasons”
strikes me as a good picture but a mis-
leading guide to history. This is by no
means the first argument over Sir
Thomas More. In the 1911 edition of
the Encyclopaedia Britannica a Church
of England clergyman wrote: “More’s
life and works have all along been
manipulated for political purposes and
in the interest of the Holy See.” In
short, Sir Thomas is a Sectarian Issue.
It is, perhaps, bad taste to mention the
subject at all in these ecumenical days,
but journalistic instinct got the better
of me.
A minor indication of the film’s atti-
tude to facts is the flat statement in
the epilogue that Henry VIII died of
syphilis. The latest authority to discuss
this question was Professor J. F. D.
Shrewsbury, Professor of Bacteriology
at the University of Birmingham, in his
book “The Plague of the Philistines,
1964. After a lengthy examination of the
medical histories of Henry, his wives,
and his children, the Professor could
find no definite evidence of syphilis. He
thought Henry’s chief ailment was
probably gout.

AUSTRALIA'S
GREATEST

CELLAR
MASTER
To keep or drink
your wine—that's
the question
AUSTRALIAN WINES are particu-
larly robust. Ronald Avery, the great
octogenarian English wine merchant,
commented on an old Hunter red that
I once showed him, “This is a won-
derful wine, quite unlike anything I
have ever seen. It has its own particu-
lar flavor and a great deal of firmness
to it. If you must compare, and I see
no reason why you should, it’s a cross
between a classic burgundy and a great
Bordeaux.”
I was surprised at this remark, since
for many years we had classified the
Hunter reds as burgundies. More
recently, a French photographer I
showed a few wines to said, “Yes, they
are very good, and they are very
strong.” I had a very light wishy-washy
thin Bordeaux wine from Entre-Deux-
Mers and I opened it for his inspec-
tion. “Ah, this is what we call wine,”
he said. But this was as far removed
from a classic French wine as I am
from Charles de Gaulle.
Undoubtedly, therefore, our wines are
robust and long-lived. Yet in the spate
of cellar activity the questions reoccur.
What wines should I buy? How long
should I keep them? When will they
be at their best?
Other questions occur to me. Is all
this activity worth it? Will the ultimate
wine-benefit justify the years of storage?
Well, the answer is an emphatic yes
and no!
I believe that our wines reach a
certain level, and though they can stay
there for certain years it doesn’t neces-
sarily mean they will improve. Also,
that you will be able to recognise
quality fairly quickly after a year or
so in the bottle. Even the relatively new
palate will be able to determine, after
this initial bottle-age period, if the
wine is worth keeping for further
improvement. The Lindemans Bin 1590
59 Hunter was a marvellously drink-
able burgundy in ’63 and, in my
opinion, hasn’t improved since, though
it hasn’t changed a scrap, either. On
the other hand, I have stored wines
for many years that were too firm and
hard, hoping that they would soften.
My many wine-sharing friends have
“Oh, this will keep for years.”
Yes, but will it improve? I doubt it.
I am not suggesting for a moment
that the speed of the 1590 maturation
,is an indication of how long I think
wine should be kept. Maturing time
varies from wine to wine, and a wine
can well improve-for 15 years. But
my point is that I do think you would
know fairly quickly.
A week of very special tastings
finally helped me reach this most satis-
factory conclusion. Dan Murphy, the
author of “The Australian Wine Guide”
showed me a ’5l Seppelts Chalambar
burgundy and a ’54 Penfolds Dalwood
Hermitage. I showed him a ’36 Thomas
Hardy Cabinet claret. All of these wines
(once standard commercial lines) were
wonderful and had benefited from con-
siderable bottle age. But I felt that they
had reached their peak years ago and
had been held together by their Aus-
tralian strength.
At the conclusion of the tasting,
Graham Kerr, my Bulletin colleague,
was presented with a Margaux 1934,
this being the year of his birth. Walter
James, the GOM of Australian wine
writers, huffily remarked, “If anyone
is thinking of giving me a bottle, I was
born in ’45 or ’47.”
A couple of days later I shared with
another Bulletin colleague, Batman,
who comes from a village somewhere,
a range of Hunters. An Elliott, Linde-
mans Bin 1650, and a McWilliams OP
and OH, all of the ’59 vintage, McWil-
liams P and OP ’5B and another
Lindeman’s ’57, together with a ’57
Robert from the Rosehill paddock. All
were perfectly splendid drinking, and
having bought the wines and stored
them for four or five years I could
trace their development. The wines fell
in exactly my order of preference of
four years ago. All were good, some
were better than others, and my prefer-
ences had remained. I couldn’t see any
of the wines improving that much
further. Perhaps another couple of years
would deepen the flavor and enrich the
bouquet, but I wonder if this would be
worthwhile, since they are such good
drinking now.
The following day Rudy Komon
showed a ’57 Draytons, a ’53 Reynella,
the incredible Lindemans Burgundy
1111 of the same vintage, and a quite re-
markable Rouge Homme Coonawarra
’57 Cabernet Sauvignon. The latter was
an absolute joy to drink, with fully
developed bouquet and flavor and none
of that over-astringent character that
some of the Coonawarras get. Again I
thought none of these wines would im-
prove that much, though, again, they
will live for years and years, probably
in much the same condition.
Without doubt, our table wines are
among the sturdiest in the world. Yet
the fact remains that the peak may be
reached fairly early, though it does hold
for years.
So, when cellaring, bear this in mind.
Don’t hold on to wines ad infinitum.
Quality is fairly quickly discerned, and
if the wine has lack of balance or ob-
trusive characteristics it is likely to
retain them for years.

in Sydney
the trend is
to The
Australia
Hotel
Here are the reasons why...
The experience of the new man-
agement team is already being
reflected throughout the entire hotel.
The newly decorated rooms and
suites offer the most spacious—and
most gracious—comfort in the city
(yet the rates are comparable with
standard hotels). There are new
catering facilities, new menus
and an enlarged Vintage Cellar.
There is a new look in service:
most friendly, most efficient, yet
most unobtrusive. There are many
extra services now available
such as free parking for house
guests. All these changes have been
subtly blended into the traditional
atmosphere which has long iden-
tified The Australia as Sydney’s dis-
tinguished hotel.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
Nickel, nickel: but
I can't
figure it out
“PUT ANOTHER NICKEL IN” has
been a popular lyric on the Exchange
floor over recent months. The main
promoter of this tune into investors’
“Top 40” charts was Western Mining-
Corporation. The whole thing started
rather quietly back in February, 1966,
when the company made a preliminary
announcement of a nickel find at Kam-
balda, near Kalgoorlie, in Western Aus-
tralia. The market yawned and moved
up WMC’s shares by three cents to
$2.63. Then there came the dawning
(along with more reports), and the
share prices started to behave like
Topsy. They just grew and grew . . .
The price today is over $12.00. On
a capitalisation basis this means that
the market has valued the company’s
find (so far confirmed at over 200 mil-
lion lb. of nickel, with more to come)
at over $lOO million. Admittedly I’ve
discounted two other bull points which
may have affected the price. Alcoa,
the aluminium complex in which the
company holds a 20 percent interest,
will earn its maiden profit this year, as
will WMC’s iron ore division. Both
encouraging facts, but hardly a $lOO
million worth of joy.
What, then, makes nickel worth so
much? It is one of the most sought-
after metals in today’s market-place. It
sells for around $lBOO a ton (about
twice the price of copper) and lately
buyers just don’t seem to be able to fill
their order books. Annual world con-
sumption, which was around 840 mil-
lion lb. in 1966, is currently 100 mil-
lion lb. less than output. Current rates
of usage have only been able to con-
tinue over recent years because of
usually massive stockpiles. For instance,
the U.S.A., which had a stockpile of
300 million lb. in 1965, is now down to
below the 100 million lb. mark. How-
ever, new mines currently being opened
in Canada and several other countries,
including Australia, should bring the
future supply/demand situation a little
more into balance.
World consumption has grown by
almost 20 percent yearly since 1963.
Before that it was closer to two per-
cent. The reasons for the demand jump
are mainly due to the space age, the
wider use of stainless steel products,
which use nickel as the hardening alloy,
and to the Vietnam war. Experts pre-
diet, as with many other metals, that
there will be a considerable easing in
demand when peace is restored to
South-East Asia.
What does this all mean to WMC?
A Melbourne broker, who just by-
coincidence was once the secretary of
WMC, has published a detailed
survey telling what he thinks it means.
He estimates that by 1967/68 nickel
will be the company’s top earner and
will contribute $2 million to the profit
purse. He goes on to say that contribu-
tions will then grow by $1 million each
year until 1969/70.
Personally, guesstimates of WMC’s
future profit are a bit beyond me, be-
cause of lack of information. I have no
nickel company in Australia for com-
parison purposes and the only official
information I have is on reserves and
ore quality. The costs of setting up a
smelter and running it are mysteries to
me. Any expert who can solve these un-
knowns deserves all he can earn. Un-
fortunately my ignorance on the subject
precludes me from being a buyer. If
I can’t figure it out, I’ll stay out new
contract and all!
What does interest me is a low-priced
stock with an active turnover and a
price which is near the year’s nadir.
I figure it’s easier for a 20 cent share
to go to 30 cents than it is for a $6
one to go to $9. It was along this line
of thinking that I purchased Nutt &
Muddle. This company is particularly
well known to the N.S.W. club clique
as the maker of the Silver Jubilee one-
armed bandits. Last year the company
earned a 34 percent profit on capital
and paid a 14 percent dividend. This
year the dividend looks like being 15
percent if the interim of 1\ percent is
any guide, and earnings should equal or
better last year’s effort. New export
markets recently opened will help the
situation. Buying at 29 cents per 20
cent share, I hope for once to make
something out of the “pokies.”
This week it was au revoir for an old
but somewhat inactive friend. Eglo and
I finally parted company. Having seen
its price sit on the year’s peak of 90
cents for the past few weeks, I gave
up hope of better things and sold out.
The eight months’ holding ended up
yielding me more in dividends than it
did in capital profits.

The BOAC armchair.
The seat that showed there's
always improvement
for room.
BOAC:P29B
In case you didn’t know, all international airline seats are the
same distance apart. It’s regulation.
So you’d think there’s nothing anyone could do about making
seats roomier.
But BOAC did.
See, the problem really isn’t that seats are too close together.
It’s just that most conventional seats waste a lot of the space
they occupy.
BOAC’s armchair has a unique space-saving
moulded plastic shell, saves inches of room because it’s thinner.
Then, more legroom is gained because each row of seats is
supported by only two legs. And the back of each seat is
recessed.
Just like your favourite armchair at home it fits you. You
don’t have to fit it.
BOAC’s economy class seats go West from Australia 7 times
a week through India. 3 times a week East through the USA.
Fly with us and we’ll give you extra room for no extra fare.
That’s fair.

The Kellys ride again
IN YEARS TO COME, we imagine,
part of our folklore will be how young
Garry Shead came down out of the
North Shore one fine autumn morning
and rode into the town of Sydney.
Twenty-four hours later, and with not

which he plans to make a 100-minute
film of the life of Ned Kelly. (£lO,OOO,
he points out, was the reward offered
for capture of the Kelly gang.)
Two overseas film companies have
already announced films on the Kelly
theme, one with British actor Michael
Caine and one with American Vic Mor-
row, but Shead could gallop in first.
Shead, an established artist who has
already made some highly praised short
films, has much of his casting done
and most of his locations chosen. He
proposes to begin filming on June 5 at
St. Aubin’s, near Wiseman’s Ferry, and
other locations in the Hunter Valley.

has decided is much more like Kelly
country than anything south of the
border.

AS I SEE IT
Holt steers away
from trouble
over the Voyager
BY ALAN REID
PARLIAMENTARIANS, who love fine
points and follow the drifting straws of
political movement with absorbed self-
interest, are puzzled as to whether
Prime Minister Harold Holt and his
Government won or lost on the Voyager
issue.
On the simple facts, Holt and the
Government undoubtedly lost. Vic-
torian Liberal John Jess undoubtedly
won. After four years of unsuccessful,
and seemingly hopeless battering of
his head against the stone wall of Gov-
ernment negation, he secured publicly
in the Parliament the reopening of the
inquiry, something that had been
denied to him in the privacy of the
Party room, and in the inconclusive
discussions in the offices of a pro-
cession of Navy Ministers and two
Prime Ministers.
When somebody wins as Jess un-
doubtedly did—there has to be a loser.
And the loser was unmistakably Holt
and the Government viewpoint that
there was no need for reopening of the
Voyager inquiry in fact, not only
no need, but that it was undesirable
because the now-restored morale of the
RAN might easily be impaired.
Jess, young by political standards,
and overstrained, was seemingly
genuinely upset that the march of
events forced him into a course of
action which resulted in the reputa-
tion of a dead man Captain Duncan
Stevens being questioned (even as
far as some speakers, including Mr.
Edward St. John, QC, were concerned,
actually assailed). Mr. Jess expressed his
feeling that it was a win for him in
fairly direct terms. “I am glad,” he said,
“to have achieved this result after four
years of seemingly hopeless struggle.”
But facts are never simple in politics.
The measure in politics, basically, is
not who wins a point, but who wins
politically.
As I see it, Holt politically did well
out of the affair. He emerged with a
much tighter grip upon his Party than
he had before and strengthened his
leadership with a Parliamentary per-
formance that was his best for years.
And this was in a field in which his
followers, comparing him inevitably
with his predecessor, Sir Robert
Menzies, have always had reservations
about his capacity.
Holt has a good intuition. As I hear
it, he returned from Melbourne, after
the Government Parties’ meetings which
produced the original Voyager pub-
licity, convinced that the best solution
to the whole affair was the appointment
of a Parliamentary Select Committee
to examine the evidence about the late
Captain Stevens’ drinking habits, which
Jess so passionately believed should be
tested on oath. But the consensus of
Cabinet opinion was against Holt.
This opinion held that there was no
need for a reopening of the Voyager
inquiry. It was felt that Jess and his
supporters in the Liberal Party room
were relying upon the allegedly uncor-
roborated, unsworn testimony of a
single witness, former Lieutenant-
Commander Peter Cabban, Captain
Stevens’ one-time executive officer on
the Voyager. It was thought that Jess’
supporters could not produce a Parlia-
mentary situation in which an inquiry
could be forced.
Essentially a team man, Holt bowed
to the Cabinet majority opinion, even
though as a shrewd politician he had
John Jess...a four-year battle
left open his options by declaring pub-
licly that his mind was not closed to
the possibility of a Parliamentary Select
Committee. As events turned out, Holt’s
intuition was right. The Cabinet con-
sensus as to the likely outcome was
wrong.
St. John’s performance was un-
doubtedly a turning point in the debate.
When he gave the weight of his
authority as a QC and a former Acting
Judge to such bald assertions as “I
believe this man (Mr. Cabban) is tell-
ing the truth,” and then, on the basis
of that statement, said that the late
Captain Stevens was “perpetually
drunk” the debate could have only one
result. Labor, sitting as a jury, and in
my belief until then genuinely uncom-
mitted, could go only one way. I t
decided to support the St. John amend
ment, seconded by Mr. Harry Turner
Lib., N.S.W., for the setting-up 0 f j
Parliamentary Select Committee. How
could such legal authority be dis-
regarded?
But there was a second turning point
in the debate. Holt came in. Those
Liberal Members who believed that the
whole thing was going too far on the
uncorroborated, unsworn testimony of a
single witness were audibly regretting
the departure from the Parliamentary
scene of their old leader, Sir Robert
Menzies. “The old man would have
known what to do,” was their wistful
comment.
Holt showed that he knew what to
do. Even if Mr. Cabban’s evidence was
uncorroborated and unsworn, the at-
mosphere had been created in which a
legitimate question was whether the
opportunity to have his evidence
sworn, tested by cross-examination, and
corroboration (or repudiation) made
available through proper legal facilities
and under the public scrutiny of a
courtroom had been given or mistakenly
denied.
An even larger subject had intruded.
If the accuracy of Cabban’s evidence
was established, there must obviously
be something wrong with the promotion
and report system on potential com-
manding officers in the RAN. Had the
late Captain Stevens personal weak-
nesses that should have debarred him
from command of a ship? If so, why
were they not known? If they were
known, why had there been no action?
Holt realised that with the publicity
given the debate and the allegations
based upon Mr. Cabban’s statement
there must be public disquiet. An in-
quiry was essential. Holt cut his losses
with a minimum of damage and a
maximum of grace.
He announced that he would recom-
mend the establishment of the judicial
inquiry that is now to be held by three
judges. But he also defended the
propriety of the Government’s action
so far, and the manner in which his
predecessor, Sir Robert Menzies, the
Royal Commissioner who inquired into
the Voyager sinking, St. John, and the
others involved in the affair had con-
ducted themselves. He poured oil on
the troubled waters by putting some
matters into perspective, hammering
home the point that Mr. Cabban’s
allegations were not established and
continued to be .merely allegations until
they were sworn, tested, and corrobor-
ated. He took much of the emotional
excitement out of the debate, and as a
leader’s task in a Parliamentary
democracy is to handle reverses ade-
quately, as well as triumphs modestly,
did a first-class job for his Party. Holt
has given indications of possessing a
quite imaginative capacity for leader-
ship in other directions. Subjected to
his first real test, he showed he also
had the capacity to provide Parlia-
mentary leadership.

Voyager: the day Parliament
proved its worth
IT QUICKLY BECAME a cliche that
last week saw the most exciting Parlia-
mentary drama since the Browne-
Fitzpatrick privileges affair 14 years
ago. But unlike that occasion this one
ended with a happy consensus that the
democratic institution stood the test
and delivered the right goods.
Around the corridors of Parliament
they said the fools had been exposed
and the men of integrity vindicated.
The Government could have used its
numbers to steamroller the compelling
demands for a new inquiry into the
Voyager affair, but after an energetic
defence of its own lack of initiative it
did —under the strong leadership of
PM Holt—do the big thing and agree
to a Judicial Inquiry.
Another cliche was that it sorted the
sheep from the goats. Attorney-General
Nigel Bowen went in first. His timing
was foolish and he made a half-
hearted defence of the Government’s
failure to be moved by Mr. Jess’
private representations over 30 months.
Worst of all, he appeared to com-
mit the Government against any
new inquiry, an option the PM was at
pains to leave open. Jess himself, in an
emotional, breathless 70 minutes,
spewed out his attack on the Govern-
ment like grapeshot. It stung but did
not injure.
The tide of the battle turned when
Navy Minister Don Chipp, in pur-
ported refutation of Lieutenant-
Commander Cabban’s claim that Cap-
tain Stevens had been involved in a
collision with another destroyer,
quoted the captain of the ship as
having said that Cabban had brought
Voyager “alongside rather heavily. ’
Then he quoted a series of reports
on Stevens, many of which im-
pressed listeners more with their
ambiguity than with their denial of his
alleged heavy drinking. Worst of all, it
was the Navy Minister himself who
introduced the nickname “Drunken
Duncan” into the Parliament.
If there were already doubts, they
were built up into a great superstructure
of suspicion by the sparkling, incisive,
and devastatingly logical speech of Mr.
St-Mn, a QC at his best:
, ‘Voyager behaved in an almost
incredible fashion . . . the incredible
is left unexplained . . . among the
mass of verbiage and in the welter
of human emotions and cross-currents,
the simple truth may be lost . . .
drink and night maneouvres at sea
do not mix . . . the only bodies
recovered from sea all contained
their due proportion of alcohol . . .
Cabban, Stevens’ offsider . . . the
odd man who is prepared to tell us
the plain unvarnished truth ... a
great number of people go along with
the Establishment, saying let us not
denigrate the deceased ... on this
plea, perhaps, we let men go down
to their death . . . important evidence
was available but not called . . . Cab-
ban’s evidence that Stevens was per-
petually drunk was declared irrelevant
. . . how ridiculous is it that I should
have to cite at second hand what
Cabban says, and that the Minister
for the Navy should recite at second-
hand what is said to be a refutation
. . . these matters should be dealt with
by proper judicial inquiry.”
And in provoking the Prime Minister
to a foolish interjection, and the Navy
Minister to his feet (dragged down by
Mr. Snedden), St. John produced the
symptoms of rout. From that time
on those around Mr. Holt were saying
there must be an inquiry, but the
foolish continued to deny their defeat.
Despite powerful backing by Mr.
Harry Turner and Mr. Clyde Cameron,
Government supporters rose to attack
the Jess-St. John case: first, Killen,
loudly but ineffectively, then sacked
Navy Minister Chaney, pathetically,
and, last silly billy, the Treasurer
with an attack on St. John with more
sneers and misrepresentations than
might be expected of any attack on a
detested Left-winger.
Wiser Ministers, even though more
directly involved, like Defence Minister
Fairhall, sat quietly awaiting the out-
come. Everything was set up for a
debacle for the Government, but Holt
rose to the occasion over the urgings
of McMahon and others.
He devised a two-pronged salvage
operation and implemented it with
dignity and conviction. One prong was
a vigorous and well-documented
defence of the Government’s past reluc-
tance to reopen the case on the basis
of Cabban’s evidence. The second was
a simple acknowledgement of the fact
that doubts had now been created, and
should be resolved. Therefore, there
should be a Judicial Inquiry.

Canberra
News valves
MUCH OF THE NEWS which flows
from Parliament into Canberra every
day is controlled by a growing army of
public relations men who surround
Ministers and Government departments
and keep a finger, not on the pulse but
on a valve.
The Voyager debate showed that
their influence including, to some
extent, influence over the Parliamentary
Press Gallery is far from slight.
On Tuesday and Wednesday the nor-
mal flow of news releases known to
the journalists as “handouts” was re-
markably thin. The astute PR men
knew that “their” Minister or Depart-
ment would have little chance of com-
peting for news space with such a sen-
sation.
Not only did the ever-vigilant PR
men manage to control this flow of
news, they also fobbed off Pressmen
chasing routine stories with the excuse
that the story had “no chance” of get-
ting in a newspaper against the reams
of copy from the Voyager debate. But
by Thursday the Government propa-
ganda valve was wide open again and
the handouts flowed thick and fast.
The control of news is becoming
more evident with the growing habit
of some PR men of releasing a story to
the Press during the week and embargo-
ing it until Sunday, a slack news day,
so it will get a good run in the Monday
morning Press.


Parliaments Clerks
Whitlam's attack
ALAN REID’S OBSERVATIONS in
The Bulletin last week that certain
Senate officers were advising the Senate
on what should be the tactics for the
“No” case in Saturday’s nexus Referen-
dum were carefully noted in all sec-
tions of Parliament House and finally
overflowed into both chambers.
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam
obviously agreed with Reid’s views that
such intrusion into politics justified
comment, and, in the one-sided final
debate on the Referendum in the House
of Representatives, departed from the
long-standing Federal tradition that
permanent officers of the Federal Parlia-
ment are never criticised by Parlia-
mentarians.
He named Mr. James Odgers, Clerk
of the Senate, as the author of the DLP
plans to increase the Senate. Mr. Whit-
lam said the proposal made it clear
that any dividend would be for minority
parties. He said, “The Odgers Plan is
a prescription for frustration. I deplore
the fact that Clerks of the Parliament
should enter politics in this way.”
Mr. Whitlam then widened the
attack with a thrust at the Clerk of
the N.S.W. Parliament, Major-General
Stevenson, who, he said, was lending
his name to the “No” case on the
basis that there was no need for more
Parliamentarians.
The Senate rallied on the resump-
tion at 10 a m. the next morning. One
of the first questions of the day came
from Senator George Howard Branson
(Liberal, W.A.), who asked if Senator
Henty, Government Leader in the
Senate (and presumably all other
Senators) had noted the. “cowardly
attack” by Gough Whitlam on Mr.
Odgers, a man “not in a position to
defend himself,” in this case.
Senator Henty, in a cautious reply,
emphasised that Clerk Odgers was a
world expert on Senate procedures
the logical extension being that Odgers
well knew the boundaries of his role in
Senate activities.
Another point from Senator Henty:
“Never at any time have I had from
him (Odgers), or heard him make, any
reference whatever to any political
matter. He has given advice to me as
he will give advice to any Senator
on the procedures of the Senate, on
which he is an expert.” He “deplored”
the Whitlam attack.
On this the Senate rested but it
was an armed truce as rumors were
circulating that the DLP were ready
to assert (on evidence, one of their
members claimed) that the “Yes” case
was drafted by officers of the Prime
Minister’s Department.
Trade Minister McEwen
Kennedy Round
Profitable wait
“WELL, FIRST THEY had to sleep
it off: and now they’ll be living it
up,” a Trade Department man said of
the team of Australian negotiators now
finished with the Kennedy Round
trade talks in Geneva. He claimed that
in the last 72 hours of the talks the
men had not had more than a total of
two hours’ sleep. For a month they
had had less than four hours in bed
each night.
A Press release telegrammed by the
delegation from Geneva was uncharac-
teristically complaining. It attributed
to Mr. McEwen the statement that the
negotiations had been “tormentingly
frustrating.” Inquiries reveal that proto-
col kept Mr. McEwen entirely out of
the official talks: he didn’t participate
in a single official negotiating session
during his five weeks in Geneva. Like
Mr. Calwell at the famous Canberra
Hotel meeting of the ALP Federal
Executive in 1963, the faceless officials
kept him out in the cold, waiting.
Or at least he was kept out in the
waiting-rooms and corridors, waiting
for officials to sneak out for a minute
to give a progress report, or waiting
for the short adjournments of the for-
mal sessions, during which the teams
would devise their next tactical negoti-
ating manoeuvre. All the time undoubt-
edly dying to get in there and declaim
as only John McEwen can, he hung
around day after day, waiting.
There was to be a full Ministerial
session, they kept saying, and then he
would be able to have his go. But
crisis after crisis, breakdown after break-
down, deadlines being broken and
broken again, it was all suddenly over
without a Ministerial meeting. Mr.
McEwen never had his go: the face-
less men had finally, at tedious last,
settled it all themselves.
But it was all, happily, frustration
profitably endured. The wheat agree-
ment alone is estimated to be worth
$4O million a year to us, though offi.
cials say privately that this is a very
conservative estimate. World wheat
prices are likely to rise by about 1()
percent, and in Australia the benefits
of this will be shared about equally
between farmers and taxpayers (who
used to subsidise wheatgrowers to the
tune of $2O million a year). Agreements
on meat and sugar should follow.
Disaster fund
Polite rejections
SENATOR DOROTHY TANGNEY,
the first woman ever selected to the
Australian Senate, has been placed third
on the ALP’s Senate ticket in Western
Australia and has little or no chance
of re-election.
Although reconciled to her fate, Sena-
tor Tangney has one burning ambition
to accomplish before she bows out of
the Senate after 25 years. She wants to
see the Federal Government establish
a National Disaster Fund to provide
quick relief after bushfires and floods.
She has been advocating such a fund
since 1950, and the disastrous bushfires
in Tasmania earlier this year and the
floods in North Queensland have given
added weight to her argument. But so
far she has been greeted with only
polite rejections by the Government.
“Although I am quite certain all
Senators are sick and tired of hearing
me mention the matter,” she told the
Senate last week, “I intend to continue
until something is done about it.
“I suggest that even by adding one
penny in the pound to Income Tax we
would achieve the nucleus of a very
good fund which could be drawn upon
instead of having to wait to go through
all the machinery of a State Govern-
ment approaching the Commonwealth.”
Senator Tangney is unimpressed by
recent assurances by the Prime Minister
that the Government would study simi-
lar schemes in Canada and New
Zealand to see if one would be applic-
able in Australia. She tabled details
of these schemes in the Senate several
years ago, but still nothing has been
done.

New Guinea
Taking a non-rise
TERRITORIES MINISTER Charles
Edward Barnes must sometimes wonder
whether it would not be easier to
return to raising horses. The long-
awaited decision on local officers’
wages, delivered by the Public Service
Arbitrator, Mr. L. G. Mathews, has
thrown Mr. Barnes’ New Guinea empire
into turmoil. Not only local officers but
the Australian-dominated Public Service
Association have joined in the protests.
Latest development was a call for the
Arbitrator to resign.
Immediate cause of the protests was
Mr. Mathews’ decision to give local
officers a rise of 76 cents a week, but
the roots of the dispute go much
deeper. In 1964 the Commonwealth
Government spelled out its basic philo-
sophy toward living standards in New
Guinea in its now notorious ordinance:
local officers would have to learn to
live at a level which a future inde-
pendent New Guinea could afford.
This ascetic attitude aroused con-
siderable criticism then, not on eco-
nomic grounds, but because it created
acute political problems. Racial ten-
sion could only be acerbated by a gulf
between local and expatriate wage levels.
The present “increase” could hardly
have been better designed to add to
the tensions, making local officers ask
who is “taking a rise” out of whom?
To avoid actually reducing local
officers’ salaries when they were already
earning European levels of pay, “non-
reduction allowances” have been paid
since 1964. Result: very few local
officers actually receive the new
increase. Not only this 76 cents, but
most of the increments they might
expect to earn during a career in the
Public Service, will never materialise.
Victoria
New ALP leader
THE CABAL WHICH runs the Vic-
torian Labor Party central executive
did not want Mr. Clyde Holding to
become leader of the State Parlia-
mentary Party. Their first choice was
Hr. Harry Jenkins, a medical prac-
titioner and a member of the Victorian
executive.
The former leader, 58-year-old Mr.
Luve Stoneham, came down from his
country seat of Midlands ready to with-
oraw if the numbers were against him.
that they were, became obvious a day
or two before the vote. Stoneham and
ls deputy, Mr. “Dinny” Lovegrove,
vacated the field and the general
opmion is that their former supporters
e cided to back Holding on the grounds
Clyde Holding ... fighting words
that he would be more independent of
the Party executive than Jenkins.
Other factors working in Holding’s
favor were that he is a powerful Parlia-
mentary debater—only he and Love-
grove ever give Sir Henry Bolte much
trouble—a lawyer with great ability to
master Parliamentary briefs, and a
tough and long-sighted political tac-
tician.
At 36, Holding has seen early fulfil-
ment of his plans to capture the Parlia-
mentary leadership. He joined the Party
at the age of 17, and first became
prominent as president of the Mel-
bourne University ALP Club. In the
days before the split he seemed to find
no discomfort in working with and
alongside members of the Industrial
Groups who later formed the DLP. In
fact, in his student days he was known
as something of an anti-Communist.
Since the split he has found it equally
easy and convenient to work with the
extreme Left-wingers who have gained
control of the Victorian Party. In 1962
he was rewarded with the State seat of
Richmond. In Parliament since, he has
risen to the forefront through his con-
cern for, and aggressive speeches about,
such issues as education, Aboriginal wel-
fare, the police, and social services.
He has openly supported the majority
force controlled by the executive at
State conference, although he always
privately supported some measure of aid
for private schools “based on necessity.”
The executive machine, however, has
always been a bit wary of him, because
he is not basically an ideological poli-
tician and because of his obvious and
driving ambition. It is not likely that
Clyde Holding will be even minimally
satisfied to remain Leader of the Oppo-
sition. He wants to become State
Premier and he realises the difficulty
of the task. Having played his cards
shrewdly and won the leadership of the
Parliamentary Party, he is now prepared
to set about winning the Treasury
benches.
In his first statement after becoming
Leader he showed that he knew the
State executive was one of his biggest
obstacles. Asked how far Labor MPs
would co-operate with the executive, he
replied, “I would expect much of the
initiative for formation of political
policy to come from the Parliamentary
Labor Party.” In Victoria these are
fighting words.
Holding supports a number of the
proposals of the Wyndham Plan for
reforming the Federal structure of the
ALP and now that he is more free of
the Victorian executive may turn out
to be a Whitlam supporter after all. It
will be interesting to see where he
stands when the present executive is
opposed by a moderate ticket at next
month’s State conference.
Tasmania
Charity split
THE AUSTRALIAN CEREBRAL
Palsy Association’s 1968 “Miss Aus-
tralia Quest” was well on the way in
most States last week, with the usual
cash, car, free wardrobe, and free trip
prizes on offer to all girls over 17 who
cared to try raising $4OO for this charity
and become State “Miss.” Then on the
eve of the “Miss Tasmania Quest,” in
which funds raised have been shared by
all organisations helping handicapped
children, a dispute over allocations led
to a split in this year’s effort.
The main fund-raiser in previous
years, the Tasmanian Retarded Chil-
dren’s Welfare Association, said it was
tired of raising more (64 percent of the
total last year) and getting less (a 42
percent share). It would not support
“Miss Tasmania” but would run a “Miss
Teena” contest in opposition.
That left the Spastic Children’s
Treatment Fund of Tasmania “in a
very difficult position.” Said its chair-
man, “We hope the Tasmanian public
will not forget us.”

“A 3 hr. meeting
on a dictating
machine, how?”
S3
O
Well, the
National RQISBS is
more than a dictating
machine, it’s a portable
tape recorder. It
plays and records for
3 hours (not 40 minutes), has
2 speeds (not just 1): 1% for dictation
and 3% i.p.s. for finer musical effects.
So when your secretary hangs up her ear-
phones for the night you whisk the
National home and soak up some music
from the large 6" cabinet speaker. (Most
dictating machines make do with a smaller,
one housed in the mike.) And when you’re
dictating with the RQISBS, you can
switch to “auto-voice” to catch your words
and not your pauses. So why lavish more
on a 1-speed dictating machine? $189.95
buys you a 2-speed, 9-transistor National
tape recorder.

L. L. Sharkey
"Patriotic son"
WHEN LAWRENCE SHARKEY died
he was still the best-known Communist
in Australia. For nearly fifty years he
had watched the Party grow, had
stamped his own ruthless personality
on its functionaries and its policies, had
watched hard-eyed as the bright young
men climbed the slippery path to power
he knew so well. And at the end, his
power was an empty shell.
The real “Lance” Sharkey died five
years ago, when Kruschev’s revisionism
finally made its mark in Australia. He
was above all a hard-line Communist,
a Stalinist. “Sharkey, the most wise and
far-seeing, the leader of the Com-
munists, can justly be described as
Australia’s most patriotic son,” wrote
one of his followers in 1953.
Nineteen forty-nine was to be
Sharkey’s year, the culmination of his
long-range plan to control Australia’s
resources through infiltration of its
trade unions. Unions were his speciality.
After hacking his way to the top of the
Party, he had set it on a carefully
plotted course which led to con-
trol of unions in most of our
basic industries. By 1949 he felt
strong enough to challenge the Chifley
Labor Government for real control of
the country. It was a disastrous mistake.
Without the backing of the ACTU or
the ALP, the miners were isolated and
reduced to surrender. The great Com-
munist strategy was revealed for what
it was: a plot which depended for its
success entirely upon the acquiescence
of the despised “reformists” in the
unions and the ALP.
“Australia’s most patriotic son”
evaded personal responsibility for the
disaster when he was jailed for sedi-
tion. Beguiled by a reporter into say-
ing that he would support Soviet troops
should they enter Australia “in pursuit
of aggressors,” he was tried and sen-
tenced to three years’ imprisonment,
later reduced to 18 months. He served
only 13 months, a model prisoner, and
emerged to cut down the opponents
who had tried to replace him.
He was still in the saddle by the
’sixties, an important figure in inter-
national Communist circles, adviser to
the Communist Parties of India,
Malaya, and Indonesia, trusted by
Stalin himself. But the end was close.
Sharkey rose to power by deposing
the Kavanagh leadership for their
“Right deviations.” He remained un-
bending until 1962, and at the 81
Communist Parties’ meeting in 1960
the CPA was one of a tiny handful ol
national parties to support the Chinese
line. But the strength was against
him and it eventually had its way. In
“Lance” Sharkey on release from ja[?]
in 1950
1960 Sharkey and his henchman, Rich-
ard Dixon, told Mao Tse-tung: “In
our Party’s history, Right opportunist
ideas have frequently appeared within
the Party. Those people want the
Communist Party to join the Labor
Party and to turn the Communist Party
into a Left Wing, or ginger group, of
the Labor Party.”
A year later he and Dixon changed
their line to follow the numbers, and
Laurie Aarons inherited the substance
of Sharkey’s power. Modern revisionism
and kindred “monsters” followed. Their
victory is to be ratified by the coming
June Congress. Ironically, the man
who had epitomised the “hard line”
ended his career presiding over its
death throes.
Road deaths
"Darwin wiped out"
THE FIGURES read like a World War
I battle casualty list: 27,512 killed and
670,111 injured. This was the number
of people killed and injured on Aus-
tralian roads in the 11-odd years to
the end of last September as shown in
figures released in Canberra by the
Minister for Shipping and Transport,
Mr. Gordon Freeth.
The figures take on startling propor-
tions when compared to population
figures compiled at the 1966 Census.
The 27,512 killed was 7000 more
than the entire population of Darwin,
the 20th biggest town in Australia; and
equal to the total male population of
Ballarat. Imagine the shock of such
loss in war.
A survey of road accidents recently
completed by two Brisbane doctors
reveals that one in 20 Australians would
be injured or killed in a road accident
in the next ten years—another 600,000
casualties.


Tanner
"When I was a lad, back-benchers had
enough sense not to meddle in politics"
COMMENT
“Yes” voters, please turn over
IN BALANCE, IT’S a good thing that
Australians distrust their politicians.
This is one of the reasons why we are
one of the most stable democracies on
earth. But, like any other kind of
shrewdness, scepticism about politicians,
when carried to excess, can produce an
idealistic stupidity of its own. This
seems to be happening in some people’s
attitudes toward the nexus referendum.
It is true that questions of political
expediency have caused the referendum.
But they have also caused the opposition
t° it. This is not surprising. Politics is
very largely concerned with expediency.
The best one can hope for is that prin-
ciples and intelligence should be exer-
cised within the limits that expediency
toakes possible. Politicians have to be
concerned with gaining and then exer-
cising power otherwise they become
commentators, not politicians. And
commentating can be a more
honorable profession, it is not politics.
To vote “No” to the nexus part of
the referendum is not going to reform
Politics. It is simply going to make
changes more cumbersome. Sometime
0r other there is going to be an increase
in numbers in the House of Representa-
tives. It is better that this be done in
the House of Representatives alone.
Otherwise there will also have to be
either a small increase in the Senate,
which, because the Government might
lose its majority, will make Parliament
less workable, or there will have to be
a large increase in both Houses beyond
the size anyone wants.
Voting “No” simply as a protest
against politicians can be emotionally
satisfying, but there is a better alterna-
tive for those who feel this urge. If they
cannot force themselves to vote “Yes,”
they can vote informal. It is one of the
traditions of our political democracy
that any voter can walk into a polling
booth and scrawl “None of the bastards
is any good” across his ballot paper.
But what is so wrong with a “Yes”
vote? It allows more flexibility in the
manning of Parliament than at present
exists. That is the beginning and end
of it. If voters want to raise more
general issues about whether our poli-
ticians are any good they might well
consider raising them in more appro-
priate ways. And if they think we have
too many politicians they should vote
for a measure that, by its flexibility,
means that if increases occur they will
be smaller than the Constitution at
present allows.
There is another consideration and
that is that the Constitution needs
reforming more generally. Politicians
being what they are, a “No” vote is
likely to deter them from considering
more difficult and worthwhile reforms.
If, by some dreadful accident,
emotionalism and muddle should pro-
duce a “No” vote not only on the nexus
question but also on the question of
whether we should, in our census, count
the Aborigines as human beings and
whether the Commonwealth should be
allowed to legislate for them, Australia
is going to be in a frightful mess. We
would stand up in the councils of the
world looking like racialist lunatics
(which we are not) committed to a
Nazi-like untermenschen doctrine.
It is the duty of every Australian to
see that this does not happen. If it
happened through stupidity rather than
design we might well consider ourselves
to be a nation of clowns.




PRIESTS -The Catholic Crisis
By PETER GOUGH
“THE COMMUNIST WORLD,
racked by schism from the Baltic Sea
to the China Sea, suffers not alone,”
writes the American commentator
Emmet John Hughes. “From Boston
to Bombay, the Catholic world has
entered upon a time of tension without
parallel since the age of Luther.”
The reference to “tension” in the
present life of the Catholic Church
extends, above all, into the personal
lives of priests. In less than a decade,
the once rigid mould that encased the
Roman Catholic Church has cracked
before the winds of change blown in
from Vatican Council 11. At the
present, no priest is immune from the
flexibility and uncertainty that grip the
Church.
For the Catholic priest, the indelible
mark of Holy Orders embraces his
entire person. The priesthood is the
substantial fact of his existence; it is
the motivating force that dominates his
mind and will. In theological terms,
the priest is a quasi-mediator between
God and Man, hence the precise terms
of reference that govern the life and
work of a priest are difficult to achieve,
and this becomes doubly accentuated
when the teaching and mission of the
Church are clouded, as at the moment,
in uncertainty.
Vatican II was, of course, a public
witness that the Barque of Peter had
set a course upon choppy waters. In
the years immediate to John taking
Peter’s Chair, Aggiornamento made no
claim on the Romanita syndrome that
shaped the face of Catholicism.
Already the Council has emerged
beyond the confines of an ideological
encounter and moved to a psychological
pattern. In some fashion or other, all
Catholics experience a change in the
manner of things brought into play at
the Council, but for priests, however,
the almost immutable concept of the
sacerdotal life becomes a target at the
hands of updating theologians and
reformers.
The swift strokes of change have
cast a new form over the Catholic
world in a few short years. Ten years
ago, the patrician Pius XII was still
pontificating a legalistic Catholicism
interwoven with a proliferation of
Marian devotions and fierce anti-
Communism, an expression of which
among Australian Catholics was Mr.
B. A. Santamaria’s movement.
Today the ways and life of Pius XII
are only a small segment in the long
history of the Roman Catholic Church.
In the present circumstances, the exis-
tential reality with its manifold
problems is more than sufficient to
occupy the Catholic mind. An obvious
indecision and uncertainty have gripped
the Catholic body; it is a sickening
experience for a growing number of
sensitive and articulate priests.
From the 1962 opening session of
Vatican 11, it became obvious that the
Council would bite deeply into the lives
of Catholics. Dutch, German, and
French bishops were quick to assert a
glaring lack of “freedom” in the
methods of the Italianate Curia, the
administrative machine of the Church.
The rights of the individual conscience
were proclaimed by Curia critics in
loud and clear terms, and the majority
of priests breathed a sigh of relief.
A dash of freedom and democracy,
according to progressive clerical
opinion, would lift considerably the
mission of the Church in the modern
world. In such a view, priests would
transcend their erstwhile category of
unthinking Church functionaries;
priests, the argument runs, have “rights”
as well as “duties.”
Collision course
Experience teaches in the practical
order, however, that “rights” and
“duties” are easily prone to a collision
course in the monolithic structure of the
Catholic Church. It is the popular
history of the Church for a Pope to
checkmate his bishops, and for bishops
to call the tune in dealings with their
priests.
Evidence is easy to attain in the
Catholic opinion journals that a grow-
ing number of priests are uneasy with
their lot. A common target for
criticism is the institutional structure of
the Church. In terms of Christian
commitment, the structure of the
Church is cast as a restrictive force
upon the lives of the clergy.
Anxiety among priests does not stem
from a lone issue. It comes, in fact,
in many shapes and forms. Among the
anxieties, the indecision over birth
control makes the hearing of con-
fessions a nightmare for confessors,
since two out of three Catholics ignore
the traditional teaching of the Church.
Vatican ll’s run for cover on clerical
celibacy was anything but fair treat-
ment to the reasonable pleas that had
been initiated by clerical and lay
revisionists. In a manner of summary
of clerical complaints, the failure to
stimulate a proper concern for honesty
in the life of the Church has weakened
the chain of authority between bishops
and priests.
Public witness to this rift in
AN ORDINATION CEREMONY ...
... the indelible mark of Holy Orders”
authority was the recent defection from
the Catholic Church of Father Charles
Davis. Professor Davis was a peritus
(expert) at Vatican 11, editor of the
“Clergy Review,” a stimulating intel-
lectual monthly, professor of theology
at the Jesuit-run Heythrop College,
Oxfordshire, and a writer of well-
reviewed theological works. Charles
Davis was by far the most admired
Catholic theologian in the British
Isles.
Davis maintains that he is still a
Christian, although he has no plan to
join another Church. “I do not think
that the claim the Church (Roman
Catholic) makes as an institution rests
upon any adequate biblical and his-
torical basis,” Davis declares. “I do
not believe that the Church is absolute,
a nd I do not believe any more in
papal infallibility. There is concern
for authority at the expense of truth,
as I am constantly shown by instances
°f the damage to persons by the work-
lngs of an impersonal and unfree
system.”
Almost by way of an afterthought,
Charles Davis told of plans to marry
a divinity student, Miss Florence Hen-
derson, a former Roman Catholic. “We
are both committed Christians,” said
Mr. Davis after his wedding, “and we
married in an Anglican church as such,
and not as Anglicans.”
The Davis affair was, of course, an
event much wider in significance than
the circumstances that are usual to the
marrying priest. A noted English
Dominican, Father Herbert McCabe,
suggested in “New Blackfriars” that the
Davis charges against the Roman
Catholic Church were very well
founded. “The Church is very plainly
corrupt,” said Father McCabe. “A
cardinal (Spellman) selects Christmas
as the occasion for supporting the
murder of Vietnamese civilians. The
Pope alleges that the Church’s teach-
ing is not in doubt about birth control.
Nearer home, and more comically, a
bishop (the Roman Catholic Bishop of
Nottingham) has expressed the fear
that Roman Catholics who sing carols
in Anglican churches are endangering
their faith and morals.”
Father McCabe maintained that
Roman Catholics had become so
accustomed to this state of affairs that
they were surprised when someone like
Charles Davis gave it as his reason
for leaving the Church. “We have
lived with this truth so long,” Father
McCabe concluded, “that we have per-
haps forgotten how scandalous and
how terrible it is.”
Church authorities were unwilling,
however, to concede Father McCabe
the final word. The Apostolic Delegate
in London, Archbishop Cardinale, de-
clared that Father McCabe was not in
good faith. And from Rome, the
Dominican Master-General, Father
Fernandez, sacked Father McCabe as
editor of “New Blackfriars,” and
stripped him of all priestly functions.
Father McCabe retired briefly to
Ireland.
At first sight, the sacerdotal eruptions
that are, at present, so much a feature
of the Catholic Church in England
register only a small sympathy with
Catholic priests in Australia. Fancy
theology and ideological speculation
have failed, over the years, to gain a
foothold with the Catholic clergy in
this country. Irish conservatism and
Roman legalism have long been the
dominant force that shapes the mind
of the typical Australian Catholic
priest.
For most priests, on reflection, the
long seminary course was anything but
an exciting ideological experience. In
common talk, it is usual to refer to
seminary training rather than to semi-
nary education. Experience renders the
distinction to be valid.
Bishops can muster, of course, a
strong case that a seminary is not a
university. The seminary courses in
philosophy and theology make small
claim, at least in the minds of Church
authorities, on pure academic endeavor
by the seminarists. By and large in the
episcopal estimation, seminary training
is a functional activity that seeks to
maintain the supply of priests. The
ideas and values of intellectuals are, for
the most part, an unwelcome infringe-
ment upon a status quo that still
cherishes the cult of “blind obedience.”
It is a popular memory with priests
that the seminary curriculum in
theology and philosophy made few
demands on the creative potential of
students. Latin texts in philosophy
and theology were placed before sem-
inarians, and the medieval practice of


rote-learning was the dreary and un-
rewarding scholastic experience for the
seminary student. In the practicalities
of the matter, the seminary-trained
priest suffers a disadvantage in the com-
pany of his university-educated
parishioner; here is often the seed-plot
of current lay-cleric confrontations.
Among Australian priests, however,
the major voice of clerical discontent is
aimed in the direction of the episcopal
bench. In blunt terms, the Catholic
bishops, with a handful of exceptions,
win faint admiration from their priests.
The big bone of contention is, in the
popular clerical estimation, the failure
to offer priests a voice in the election
of bishops. A closed-circuit dialogue
between the Apostolic Delegation, at
North Sydney, and Rome for the pur-
pose of electing Australian bishops
makes a poor impression with Vatican
II priests.
In an attempt to remedy the unsatis-
factory method of episcopal appoint-
ments, a Canberra-Goulburn priests’
deputation recently made a call upon
the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop
Domenico Enrici, to discuss ways and
means of sacerdotal involvement in the
election' of bishops. The deputation
from the priests of Canberra-Goulburn
was no idle dream; it was simply a
foretaste of the future.
Errant schoolboys
A case comes readily to hand that
demonstrates the priests’ junior office
in the Church’s hierarchial structure.
For all but ten years in the seminary,
the future priest is classified, for the
most part by the authorities, as an
errant schoolboy; such a system natur-
ally sponsors a negatiw reaction from
all but the most manly students.
The seminary system contributes
little to the positive side in a young
man’s personality. In point of fact,
the rules and atmosphere in seminaries
keep in check many an intellectual
endeavor and adolescent enthusiasm
among the student body. Frustration
is the concomitant for the committed
minority; sport is the outlet for the
rest. It explains, of course, the mute
voice of the average priest on the great
issues that gnaw at the heart of man
in the modern world.
Since the beginning of the 19605,
there has been, without any immediate
forewarning, a notable decline in appli-
cations for entry to the seminaries.
The Archdiocese of Melbourne, accord-
ing to the “Advocate,” has the same
number of seminarians today as 20
years ago; yet the Catholic population
of the archdiocese has doubled over the
past two decades.
Affluence and new horizons offer, a
general judgment runs, stiff competi-
tion to the seminaries. The priest pro-
jects, among discerning Catholic youth,
a lack-lustre image that fares badly
alongside the successful layman. In
blunt terms, the traditional concept of
the priesthood is a foreign entity with
an up-and-coming generation of
Catholics. A further danger lurks, in
the opinion of informed priests, that
less dynamic candidates for the priest-
hood are currently receiving encourage-
ment to enter the seminaries in an
attempt to offset the foreseeable short-
age of priests that is, at present, a
matter of grave concern to the bishops.
Hard facts indicate, the evidence is
easy to achieve, that many priests are
ill at ease within the present terms of
their priesthood; hence no wonder
arises that young Catholic men of talent
are looking outside the priesthood for
fulfilment in their lives.
A matter of major concern for the
welfare of the priesthood at the present
time is, without doubt, the touchy
question of clerical celibacy. “My
advice is, break the bonds, let each
Father Arnold McMahon
follow' his own preference whether to
marry or not to marry,” wrote Martin
Luther some 450 years ago. “The
ministry was intended to train a Church,
with pastors living among the people
and keeping house as other people do.
Such men should be granted permission
to marry, in order to avoid temptation
and sin. For, if God has not forbidden
them, no man should or may do so.
The Pope in making such a rule has
no more power than if he were to
forbid eating, or drinking, or the per-
formance of other natural functions, or
growing fat.”
During the fourth session of Vatican
11, Pope Paul sent down a message
to the bishops that they were not to
discuss clerical celibacy. The bishops
stood and cheered. But after the
cheering was over and the bishops had
returned to their dioceses, the pleas
by priests and laymen for a full-scale
inquiry into clerical celibacy were
already off the ground. If celibacy
is unable to face the reasonable de-
mands of debate, the critics maintain
the theological basis for its continu-
ance merits scant respect.
“The priesthood is a great and
wonderful thing,” wrote a young
English priest, Father Arnold
McMahon, who recently married jn
defiance of Church law. “It is some-
thing I have studied and fought for
and it is a reality I am still battling
for, because it is an ideal that one has
continually to re-win in the originality
and freshness of one’s heart.”
In support of his stance, Father
McMahon made a distinction between
what he calls God’s law and Church
law. “. . . . celibacy is not God's law,”
he wrote. “I do not believe that there
is any responsible theologian in the
Church who would seriously defend
the opinion that there is any intrinsic
relationship between the priesthood and
celibacy.”
Indications prevail that clerical
celibacy is unable to flee the respon-
The girl he married, Elizabeth John
sible scrutiny that Catholic critics
maintain is long overdue. In an attempt
to achieve hard facts, the National
Association for Pastoral Renewal was
recently formed in the United States
to report on celibacy to the National
Conference of Roman Catholic Bishops.
Already the data to hand has led the
association to request that the bishops
“begin serious discussion of the celibacy
problem.”
At the heart of clerical unrest, how-
ever, there is much more than an
appeal for a voice in the election of
bishops or marriage rights for Roman
Catholic priests. In the brief hindsight
of Vatican 11, it is a day-to-day experi-
ence that a new philosophy rests,
uneasily, over the Catholic Church, and
a new philosophy carries with it, natur-
ally enough, a new theology. And right
in the middle of this ideological turmoil
emerges a new breed of priests.
The brief pontificate of Pope John
was a hefty swipe at the out-of-date
philosophy and theology taught in the


seminaries. A Thomistic rehash of
hilosophical and theological formulae
had occupied (by “official” order), in
the pre-Johannine period, the place of
academic privilege in colleges for the
training of priests. But after John and
Vatican 11, the cult of academic bully-
ing in Catholic houses of study has
fallen upon bad times.
By way of a beginning, runs the
popular talk of Catholic intellectuals,
the toast to conscience proposed, a
century ago with small result, by John
Henry Newman is, here and now, the
top priority for Catholics. The time
has come, they are stout to maintain,
for freedom to conquer blind obedience,
and for a spirited witness to truth in the
life of the Church.
A dedication to the twin cause of
freedom and truth by the Catholic
Church bears faint reality when priests
are denied the opportunity to be first
Mr. Charles Davis, formerly a priest, after his marriage to Miss Florence Henderson
witnesses in such an enterprise. But it
is within this context, the argument of
priests asserts, that the rub occurs,
since Church authorities register small
enthusiasm for an open expression of
ideas by priests; yet, in the absence of
that right, a priest is neither free nor
a proper custodian of truth in the
ministry of his priesthood.
Today among Catholic cognoscenti,
the call for unswerving loyalty to the
Church’s institutional structure draws
only a mild response. In these post-
conciliar times, institutional Catholo-
cism, the pundits observe, is merely
the rigging on the mast of a Christo-
centric awareness among Catholic
theologians.
The new theology breathes a biblical
spirit, and is cool to the juridical ways
°f pre-Council Catholicism. It sup-
ports a democratic Church, and
opposes the traditional monarchial
structure. And in a final sweep, it
champions the rights of a man’s con-
science but seeks no privileges for a
bricks-and-mortar Catholicism,
In summary, the new theology is
existential to the core, and a voice that
takes up the cudgels of “reason” in
determining the manner of one’s life
span. A bold prospectus from its
spokesmen arouses a claim on the
whole man in his day-to-day life
pattern.
For priests there is a twofold chal-
lenge, since the kernel of the new
theology is a here-and-now incentive to
a different way of life by Catholics,
First, priests must give public assent
to the norms of the new theology in
their own lives; secondly, efforts to
communicate the value of the above
norms to the laity should exceed in
importance all other priestly work.
A moderate understanding of the
Catholic Church in Australia recognises
that the new theology is in contrast to
the traditional life of the Church in
this country. By reason of the flow of
history, Australian Catholicism func-
tions with an Irish heart and mind;
hence it is theologically deficient
(though strong in a socio-pastoral
sense), priest-dominated, prone to
simple devotion and to a habit of
divorcing religion from ordinary life,
The eirenic manner of life that pre-
vails, however, at present in pluralist
Australia blots out the need for a
ghetto-wise, religion-and-life orienta-
tion among Catholics. Today in Aus-
tralia, religious response—for Catholics
as well as non-Catholics—rests entirely
with the individual man or woman. A
person is free to accept or reject the
claims and demands of religion. Gone
are the days when a parish priest could
twist the arms of his parishioners and
lead them back into the fold,
In the light of history, then, it is
patently obvious that Catholics are
currently in the process of a behavioural
revolution. Priest and layman carry, in
their own private lives, the impact
that “situational ethics” achieve in the
moral judgments of modern, Catholic
man. In conditions common to all men
of goodwill, the conscience of a priest
determines the manner of his moral
judgments. No man can claim the
right to another man’s conscience, hence
neither Pope nor bishop can filch the
inalienable right of a priest to follow
his own conscience.
Proper recognition of the rights of
conscience lands a stinging blow on the
face of paternalism. And high on the
list of current Catholic woes figures
the weary old disease of paternalism.
It pops up, for ill, in many Catholic
places. A bishop throws reason to the
winds and attacks the integrity of a
visiting Amerrcan nun; the education
of parochial schoolchildren eats up the
Church’s labor and financial resources,
but religious ignorance among adult
Catholics (most of whom are products
of the parochial schools) registers
hardly a whimper from Church
authorities.
Articulate Catholics disagree, how-
ever, with the values espoused by
the paternalists. Religion issues
witness, the dissenters declare, to adult
values. Hence in these difficult days,
Catholic critics seek nothing less than
an adult response to the sundry matters
that disturb their Church.
The march of time has dealt a death
blow at the religious awareness in the
average Catholic parish. “Saturday
housie,” says a Sydney priest, “is the
popular image that my parish projects
to non-Catholics.” To change that
image to an involvement with the spiri-
tual bleakness that weighs heavily upon
man in the modern world is today’s
task of the priest. The wrestling of
Malcolm Muggeridge with the Hound
of Heaven means that the demand for
the work of the true priest is still much
alive.
Roman Catholicism exists, despite the
intransigence of conservatives, within
the boundaries of space and time. The
Church functions solely amidst the
concepts of a changing world. A trium-
virate of Roman priests—Augustine,
Aquinas, and Newman —worked out
their priesthood along the guide-posts
of early, middle, and modern
Catholicism. Despite their latter-day
triumphs, the dark night of the soul
was a bitter experience for the three of
them.
Today the dark night of the soul is
vividly real in the Roman Catholic
priesthood. In recent times, another
Roman priest, Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin, was caught most brutally in
its black clothes. But now he, too, is
free from men of little faith. In the
context of history repeating itself, the
present black image of the priesthood
may well be the prelude to a dawn of
much light for Roman Catholic priests.


The "Encounter" Affair
THE GATHERING STORM about
the use of funds by the United States
Central Intelligence Agency has led to
the resignation of two editors of the
Anglo-American intellectual monthly
“Encounter,” and last week the general
assembly of the American-financed
Congress for Cultural Freedom met in
Paris to reorganise itself.
Already, the truth about the CIA,
which began to break in the U.S. a
year ago and was confirmed in February
this year, has caused the resignations of
Mr. Stephen Spender and Professor
Frank Kermode on the grounds that
“Encounter,” which they helped to edit,
took money from the Congress up till
1963 and that the principal editor,
Mr. Melvin Lasky, omitted to inform
them of ClA’s contribution.
To some people, the fuss over the
resignation of Messrs Spender and
Kermode may seem vastly exaggerated.
Does it really matter very much that
the Congress for Cultural Freedom
was once financed by an American
Government agency rather than by one
of the giant American corporations like
the Ford Foundation, as it is at present?
And if the strings were so secret, could
they have had any influence on policy?
But others may consider it a salutary
rule that the ownership of newspapers
and magazines should be known to their
staff and contributors and readers. The
Congress for Cultural Freedom may
have been intended as an instrument in
the Cold War, but to continue to be
effective even for that purpose, let alone
as a vehicle for defending cultural
liberties and fostering the growth of a
world-wide community of free scholars
and writers, it needed, surely, to avoid
the crudities of Communist front
organisations.
The Congress first met in Berlin in
June, 1950. The Berlin blockade, the
Allied airlift were over. The first major
Soviet challenge to the West had been
repelled. From the beginning, the Con-
gress was a mixture of high principle
and rough intellectual street-fighting.
Three men helped to found it, with
money from the American Ladies’ Gar-
ment Workers’ Union, led by the
strongly anti-Communist David Dub-
insky. One was the distinguished intel-
lectual and former Communist Arthur
Koestler. The second was the present
executive director of the CCF, Michael
Josselson. The third was Lasky.
Lasky, who was already working in
Berlin, did most of the organising.
Earlier, in 1941, he had been assistant
literary editor of the anti-Communist
but leftish weekly “New Leader,” which
Dubinsky also financed. After the war,
Lasky recalls, when he was travelling
in Europe, he published an attack on
the “philistinism” of the American mili-
tary government. General Clay read
his article and suggested that he (Clay)
should openly sponsor a magazine which
Lasky should edit.
Lasky thus became editor of “Der
Monat” in Berlin and helped to satisfy
post-war Germany’s intellectual and
cultural hunger. Only once, he says,
did the General interfere, and that was
merely to forward for comment a letter
from the Archbishop of Cologne, Car-
dinal Frings, expressing his disapproval
of Bertrand Russell as a contributor.
Russell continued to contribute. Later
Lasky arranged for “Der Monat” to be
supported by the Ford Foundation, and
later still the Congress for Cultural
Freedom subsidised it. But by 1958
Lasky had left for London to edit
“Encounter,” with Stephen Spender.
The man who began feeding CIA
funds to the Congress was, according
to his own story, an American called
Thomas Braden. Recently, he disclosed
in the “Saturday Evening Post” that in
1950 the year the Congress was
founded he put up the idea that
the agency should subsidise student,
labor, and cultural groups.
REPRINTED FROM THE
LONDON "OBSERVER"
What more suitable organisation than
the nascent Congress for Cultural
Freedom which had been given such a
good start by Mel Lasky and his
friends?
Already it had collected five honorary
presidents: Bertrand Russell (later
replaced by the Indian Gandhian leader
Jayaprakash Narayan), historian Sal-
vador de Madariaga, philosophers Karl
Jaspers and Jacques Maritain, and
theologian Reinhold Niebuhr. Its first
self-imposed task had been to investigate
the treatment of intellectuals behind
the Iron Curtain and to invite refugees
from those States to another congress
in Paris. By October, 1953, it was ready
to sponsor the first issue of “Encounter.”
The following year, Braden, his work
now done, left CIA to publish his own
small newspaper in California, the
“Oceanside Blade Tribune.”
The first editors of “Encounter” were
Stephen Spender, poet, aesthete, ex-
Communist, veteran of the Spanish
Civil War and a fireman during World
War 11, and the American journalist
Irving Kristol Kristol had been a
contemporary of Lasky’s before the war
at the New York City College.
Lasky then was some sort of a
Trotskyist; Kristol is remembered as an
adherent of a breakaway sect, the
Lovestoneites. (Lovestone had been the
general secretary of the American Coni-
munist Party, but had broken with
the Reds and become a sort of Men-
shevik Social Democrat anti-Com-
munist.) For all of them, the “New
Leader” was the centre of their intel-
lectual life.
In the early years, under Kristol
“Encounter” prospered with Evelyn
Waugh and Nancy (U and Non-U)
Mitford as well as Koestler and Colin
Welch. When Lasky succeeded Kristol
in 1958, John Strachey became a
regular contributor, and Anthony Cros-
land helped to change the climate of
political opinion with his articles of
“revisionist” Labor policy. As Lasky got
into his editorial stride, circulation
steadily rose; it is now 42,000.
From time to time there were
rumors that “Encounter” was backed
by funds from a questionable source.
By now the Congress for Cultural
Freedom was nurturing magazines in
many countries. In France there was
“Preuves”; in Italy, “Tempo Presente,”
which Ignajio Silone helped to edit; in
Austria there was “Forum”; in the
Lebanon, “Hiwar”; in Australia, “Quad-
rant”; in Britain, besides “Encounter,”
there was the “China Quarterly” and
“Survey,” dealing with Eastern Euro-
pean affairs. Where could the money
come from for all these enterprises?
One day in 1963 an official of the
Congress told Lasky, in strict confidence
that the funds which reached “En-
counter” came indirectly from the
CIA. Lasky now determined to change
the basis of the magazine’s financing
and suggested to his colleague Spender
that his reason for doing so was that
the rumors about the CIA were getting
very nasty. Spender willingly agreed.
Lasky tried to interest the Ford
Foundation, but their rules at that
time did not permit them to come to
“Encounter’s” assistance. Spender
approached Michael King of the
“Daily Mirror,” and later Lasky
reached an arrangement with Michael’s
father, Cecil Harmsworth King, head
of the International Publishing Cor-
poration, which owns, among some 200
other journals, the two “Mirrors” and
the “Sun.” “Encounter” needed £15,000
a year to meet its deficit, which King
agreed to supply for seven years.
“Encounter’s” complete freedom to
publish what it chose was specifically
underwritten by King, and four trustees
were appointed to take care of future
changes in the editorship: two Ameri-
cans, Professors Arthur M. Schlesinger,
Jr. (historian), and Edward Shils


Arthur Koestler addressing the first conference of the Congress for Cultural Freedom
(sociologist); and two Englishmen, Lord
Rothschild, the scientist (later replaced
by Sir William Hayter, Warden of New
College, Oxford), and Andrew Shon-
field, the economist from Chatham
House.
(While all this was going on, Con-
gress, too, was seeking a new financial
base. This took somewhat longer, but
by 1965 the Ford Foundation was
providing all the help it needed.)
For “Encounter,” Congress (except
for its 10 percent shareholding) and
the CIA were a thing of the past, and
Lasky kept what he knew to himself.
Spender soldiered on in ignorance until
the end of 1965, when he went to
America, retaining a nominal connec-
tion with the magazine as correspond-
ing editor. His successor as Lasky’s
literary co-editor was a frequent con-
tributor, Frank Kermode, now Professor
of English at Bristol University. He,
too, was told nothing about the CIA
link.
A few months after Kermode’s
arrival, in April last year, the “New
York Times,” in the course of a series
of articles on the CIA, wrote that
“Encounter,” “a well-known anti-Com-
munist intellectual monthly,” was for a
long time—-“though it is not now” —
one of the indirect beneficiaries of CIA
funds. This was the first time this
allegation had appeared in print, and
Lasky, still keeping Kermode in the
'lark, flew to New York. He joined
with Spender and Kristol in denying
any knowledge of any “indirect” bene-
factions. The letter stated the Con-
gress funds were derived only from
various recognised foundations all
of them (from such institutions as the
or d and Rockefeller Foundations to
Ae small ones) publicly listed in the
official directories, with their officers
duly named, their activities described.”
The previous day, May 9, 1966,
another letter had appeared bearing the
signature of four distinguished aca-
demics: Kenneth Galbraith, George
Kennan, Robert Oppenheimer (who
died in February), and Arthur
Schlesinger. It denied what had
never been suggested that the Con-
gress for Cultural Freedom had ever
been used by the CIA, and went on to
speak glowingly of the work of Con-
gress and its publications.
Last February a spate of further
reports linking the CIA with the
Congress and hence “Encounter”
appeared in several American papers,
including the “Washington Post.” The
reports were reproduced in Britain, and
on March 29 Kermode wrote to Lasky
that if they were true he did not feel
he could carry on. On several occasions
since the publication of the “New York
Times’ ” CIA articles and the letter
which followed it, he said, he had had
to give assurances that were apparently
not now justified.
On April 2, four days after writing
to him, Kerftiode had ten hours’ con-
versation with Lasky and it was then
that Lasky at last revealed that he had
been fully aware of the true facts of
the financing of “Encounter” by the
CIA through the Congress for Cultural
Freedom. Kermode told me that
Spender had told him that he had
become increasingly worried by many
suspicions that this was so, and had
showed him letters he had written to
officers of the Congress and of the
various foundations which had financed
it and the replies he’d got specifically
denying the “canard,” as it was des-
cribed.
On April 21 the two American
trustees flew to London to meet their
English colleagues. At this meeting
Lasky said he was very sorry that out
of loyalty to a third party he had been
compelled to withhold the truth about
the CIA connection.
Recollections of meetings of this sort
tend to get a bit blurred. Kermode is
under the impression that the trustees
were unable to accept his suggestion
that Lasky should resign. He seems to
have been willing to resign himself in
that event; he certainly intended to go
if Lasky stayed.
It is easy to picture the position from
the trustees’ point of view. Kermode
was unhappy and reluctant to stay. But
Lasky, by common consent, was an
exceptionally talented editor; he did
most of the editorial work; he had a
contract on which damages would be
due in the event of dismissal. More-
over, there was the problem of financ-
ing the paper. Lasky had the confidence
and backing of Cecil King. This last
factor, however, quite genuinely doesn’t
seem to have weighed heavily. For one
thing, other sources of income were at
least in sight.
But Kermode, at any rate later, when
the dispute had become more embit-
tered, seemed to feel that the paper
itself had been discredited: it should
not only have been independent but
have been seen to be so. In the event,
the meeting broke up and the trustees
departed feeling that at least some
time had been gained in which every-
one could reflect on his position and,
maybe, Kermode could be persuaded
to stay on after all.
Time was not given. Braden’s dis-
closures were on the way. Kermode,
who is stubborn and pernickety as well
as incorruptible, had got the bit between
his teeth. Spender, who had not been
on particularly good terms with Lasky,
and Kermode, who had, resigned.
It is a tangled web. Some of those
active in the Congress, who know a
hawk from a handsaw, certainly knew
all along that American Government
money was involved though they
were staggered by the naivety of the
American approach, by the fact that
they had no Secret Service at all be-
fore the war, and the almost simple-
minded way they set up one organist
tion, the CIA, and thought it would
do for every sort of activity.
It would be tragic if the valuable
work that the Congress does and the
excellent magazines it subsidises through
the Ford Foundation were imperilled.
It would be equally tragic if “En-
counter” were to perish. It may have
been a platform for cold warriors, for
those who put most things down to
conspiracy, for whom nothing much
ever happens by accident. No doubt, at
the other extreme, among those who
make muddling through almost an
article of faith, there are excesses on a
similar scale. But those at both poles
ought, surely, to agree that there is no
other journal in the English-speaking
world which combines political and cul-
tural material of such consistently high
quality. And that, at least, is not
achieved by accident.


This business isn't
chicken feed
TAKEOVER BATTLES, price-cutting
wars —it is not only the chickens who
are getting it in the neck in the cut-
throat broiler chicken business.
The industry today is the centre of a
power struggle involving some of Aus-
tralia’s biggest and most respectable
companies and some of its youngest
and most adventurous ones; a struggle
that has brought techniques bordering
on standover tactics to small chicken
farmers, forcing many of them out of
business, and one that has carved a
multi-million-dollar industry from what
was just small-time business less than
ten years ago.
The upheaval is not simply the result
of a revolution in Australian eating
habits, though certainly there has been
one—we eat four times more chicken
per head than we did only six years ago.
The pressures on this industry are
coming from all around its edges as
well as from inside. Apart from the big
processing companies that are trying to
get bigger and stronger, there are frozen
food companies who want to add
chickens to their range, there are chain-
stores who want to tie up large sources
of cheap supply, there are feed sup-
pliers who want to tie up large users
of their feed. This last field alone is
worth millions of dollars to the supplier
milling companies, for the 65 million
chickens produced each year (13 times
as many as seven years ago) eat a lot
of chicken feed.
And broilers are perfect for the
chainstore supermarket trade, which
has taken the business completely away
from the family butcher. They are
standard sizes, standard tastes, standard
packages, and fit perfectly into the
standardised supermarkets. The only
thing that is not standard is the price*
as violent competition between the big
processors has brought retail prices
down close to production costs.
Profits have been slashed and some
producers have gone to the wall; one
of the largest public companies in the
business, Victoria’s Golden Poultry
Farming, two weeks ago reported a loss
of $lOO,OOO in the past nine months,
compared with a $300,000 profit last
year. But, losses notwithstanding,
Golden Poultry is such an important
part of the industry, it is now being-
taken over in a $3 million deal that
gives the Ingham brothers, well known
for their racecourse activities, a
dominant role in the industry.
Through Inghams Enterprises Pty.
Ltd., they paid nearly twice as much
in cash per share as was offered four
months ago by Jackson’s Corio Meat
Packing, a firm of Canadian parentage.
There had been intermediate bids by
British Tobacco’s food subsidiary, first
on its own and then in conjunction with
Allied Mills, the firm which supplies
Inghams with feed in N.S.W. and
Queensland and who undoubtedly
hoped to supplant Golden Poultry’s
present supplier, Victorian miller
Robert Hutchinson.
Allied Mills, which is also Australia’s
biggest margarine producer, was even-
tually left out fit the cold, and Hut-
chinsons have a reprieve. Inghams’
final offer included an agreement to
let British Tobacco, which has market-
ing expertise, take 40 percent of the
shares and handle Golden Poultry’s
distribution.
Inghams to date has had no trouble
in handling its own distribution. Its
capacity in N.S.W. and Queensland is
about 450,000 birds a week, and it has
an export market for chickens, ducks,
turkeys, and chicken livers in the
Pacific Islands, Hong Kong, and Lon-
don.
Another margarine maker, Marrick-
ville Margarine, of Mrs. Jones fame,
is moving into broiler breeding and
processing as a market for its stock
feeds (it owns a milling subsidiary,
F. Crago and Sons) and as a diver-
sification from its quota-restricted
table margarine business.
There are going to be more take-
overs, and the price war will keep up
for a time until all the weak ones
have been forced out of the industry.
This is a game for the big boys.
Inghams’ output is probably three
times that of Steggles’, 2| times that of
Provincial Traders’. A. A. Tegel, of Lep.
pington, N.S.W., the first to employ
geneticists for a breeding program back
in 1958, is the dominant producer of
breeding stock in Australia today, con-
trolling 60 percent of the market and
supplying firms sometimes on an ex-
clusive basis in their State. Possession
of such a franchise has attracted take-
over offers.
Other leading strains developed in
N.S.W. are SPB by Scientific Poultry
Breeders, of Kellyville, Hy-line by Hy-
line Chicks, of Luddenham, and
Speedigrow by A. V. Walsh, of Castle
Hill, and an unnamed breed by
Steggles for their exclusive use.
Once a sideline of farmers and horti-
culturists, chicken raising has become
a highly integrated and scientific busi-
ness. Processors provide day-old chicks
for the growers to raise under contract,
usually undertaking to supply feed,
medicine, and litter, and deducting
these items from the final price to the
grower.
The big processing enterprises
demand from the growers high stan-
dards of performance, otherwise out. In
a position to be price-squeezed at both
ends of their operation, broiler growers
have been feeling more and more vul-
nerable, with oversupply leading to cut-
throat competition.
Feelings between growers’ associa-
tions and the processors at times run
high, and the growers are often not
willing to talk up about their problems
for fear of victimisation. They feel that
the big processing enterprises are on
good terms with one another, and to
fall out with one processor over quality,
prices, or late payments might lead
to cessation of supplies.
Meantime, there is no sign of levelling
off in the broiler boom. The 41b. of
chicken Australians were eating per
head in 1960 is about 171 b. today,
though still only about half the U.S.
rate. But it is a different sort of
chicken; the birds now are specially
bred, fast-growing varieties and their
development has meant that growers
who do not have these more economic
birds simply cannot compete. And the
big groups have the rights to them. In
1960, when Provincial Traders began
broiler production, it took 14 to 15
weeks to produce a mature Hy-line
bird, and for each pound of meat the
bird ate 4-|-5,1b. of feed. Now 31b. of
feed is all that is required to produce
lib. of meat in ten weeks.
With afternoon newspapers full of
advertisements, chicken is being offered
at from 38c to 40c a pound. In the
glut some processors have been selling
to the trade for as low as 28c a lb.,
though a more general price is 32c to
36c a lb. wholesale, giving the store a
profit margin as low as 18 percent, less
refrigeration and handling costs.
Certainly, whoever else has reason to
complain about the way things are
going in the briefly pampered world ol
the chicken today, it isn’t, for once, the
housewife. For her the price is right,
and could even get better.

Overtures
from Utzon
By PHILIP PARSONS
THE FACT THAT negotiations are
at present taking place to bring Joern
Utzon back to work on the Sydney
Opera House has been brought out into
the open by The Bulletin. Perhaps it
is just as well. There is nothing par-
ticularly secret about the negotiations,
nor should there be. If discussion has
so far proceeded behind the scenes it is
because the public stage has been taken
up with an irrelevant melodrama of
double-dyed villains and spotless heroes,
cast according to taste.
It has been virtually impossible to
discuss the Opera House publicly with-
out being thrust into the fray as an
Utzonite or anti-Utzonite. There was
simply nowhere to go if you were
merely pro-Opera House—as are Utzon
and the present architects.
Yet this is the only basis for con-
structive discussion. It is the basis of
the present negotiations. For those who
are pro-Opera House the overriding
issue is the unique stature of the build-
ing in Australia and the world. It is
recognised among architects everywhere
as a brilliant and original design.
It is therefore not surprising that
Utzon is now prepared to consider col-
laboration with the present panel. Con-
trary to the view expressed by The
Bulletin, this would not represent a
lesser role than that proposed by the
Minister, since through the panel he
would enjoy the range of responsibilities
usual to an architect. Obviously the
form of such collaboration could not
be decided in advance. Much would
depend upon exploratory discussions in
which both sides would determine the
feasibility of collaboration.
Utzon is willing to enter into such
talks; of the architectural panel I can
only say that discussions to date have
not been chilly, as reported by The
Bulletin, but very cordial. It must be
added that the competence of either
side was never in question. The sole
issue was the service of a building great
enough to demand the best from every-
one.
In The Bulletin’s generally very
accurate account of the current negoti-
ations, one important point must be
corrected—the implication that Utzon’s
return would automatically mean the
reversal of the Government’s decision
on the use of the Major Hall. Utzon’s
record at the Opera House shows that
a t every point he accepted the client’s
changes of mind. There is no reason
to suppose that changes of mind since
his departure would present any in-
superable obstacles to his return.
Utzon’s freedom to come to Sydney
may be taken for granted since he is
willing to enter into negotiations. How-
ever, according to his Sydney office,
Utzon is still working on the Zurich
Opera House. Unless The Bulletin’s in-
formation is less than three weeks old,
its report that work will not proceed at
Zurich would seem to be without sub-
stance.
The practical difficulties in the way
of Utzon’s return are formidable, but
they should be faced not en masse but
singly. The first step clearly is discus-
sion between the architects, past and
present. These are the men who under-
stand the building and its problems
better than anyone. If they can agree
among themselves, the prospects for
formal negotiations with the client will
become more realistic. Present indica-
tions are that both sides are prepared
to consider such talks. It is now up
to the client to sanction them. If he
cares about his building as much as his
architects it is difficult to see why he
should refuse.
It is true, as reported in The
Bulletin, that Utzon’s solicitors are at
present unwilling to allow him to make
any further approaches beyond a signed
statement already communicated in-
formally to a. member of the panel. It
is not hard to understand their view
that here Utzon has already made a
large concession, and that it is unreas-
onable to expect him to prejudice a
substantial legal interest elsewhere by
going further now.
At the same time the client’s archi-
tects must naturally feel it improper to
take the initiative themselves. Such a
deadlock, however, would not be one of
substance but of form. Given good-
will, it should not be beyond the wit of
man to find a way around it. If the
client wants the best possible building,
and if the architects, after careful and
realistic consultation, decide that a
panel of four is a workable way of
giving it to him, the decision would
reflect nothing but credit on all con-
cerned. The first step calls only for
talks with nobody committed to any-
Dr. Parsons is Senior Lecturer,
Department of Drama, University
of New South Wales
thing. Properly handled, these need
compromise nobody, no matter what
the outcome.
A distinguished architect has asked
me with a bland but meaningful look:
“Don’t you feel it surprising that the
profession shows little interest in
Utzon’s return —that it is the amateurs
and idealists who are pressing the
matter?” This amateur and idealist
answered with a resounding “yes.” The
Opera House is the most important
responsibility ever entrusted or likely to
be entrusted to the profession in N.S.W.
It is indeed surprising that the profes-
sion seems now to have accepted the
impossibility of a perfectly unified con-
ception, the finest possible credit to the
profession and to all who have worked
on it.
Utzon, I am told, has done the pro-
fession untold harm by his conduct of
the project. In the absence of an
official inquiry to establish the facts, he
has been tried without ever being
heard. But it is quite certain that any
damage the profession may feel to have
been done in this way will weigh as
nothing against the mute accusation of a
great building imperfectly realised.
“The Last Ditchers” we are called by
The Bulletin—the actors in the final
scene of the Opera House melodrama.
I prefer to think that the melodrama
is at last over —that we represent not
an end but a beginning.
Such a highly personal design con-
ception simply cannot be continued by
another architect, no matter what his
gifts. What he builds cannot fail to be
different in kind, and to that extent the
result is imperfect. With a building
costing $5O million and contributing so
much to oyr international reputation,
such a risk is to be avoided. For this
reason alone it is plain commonsense
to attach the original architect in some
way to the project, if sensible terms can
be found.

OVERSEAS
A “Johnson Line” for Vietnam?
SINCE NORTH VIETNAM rekindled
the war through the establishment of
the Liberation Front in the South seven
years ago the Saigon and Washington
Governments have been confronted with
the problem of infiltration of men and
mateiial from the North. How to stop
that infiltration has remained an
unsolved problem. Bombing the Ho-Chi-
Minh trail in Laos, as well as the
logistic facilities in North Vietnam itself,
has failed to solve it. In spite of severe
losses, the VC-NVA ( Vietcong-North
Vietnamese forces) seem as aggresisve
as ever, if not more so.
The American authorities appear to
have decided on a new formula: cutting
off the Ho-Chi-Minh trail by a fortified
barrier running all the way from the
Pacific to the Mekong. The idea, pub-
licly suggested by Senator Mike Mans-
field last month and about which
American military authorities in Saigon
have kept silent, is to build a mile-wide
fortified barrier running westward from
Cua Viet, the southern part of the
mouth of the Ben Hai River, which
divides North from South Vietnam. The
barrier is to be built as far as the
border between South Vietnam and
Laos. It will have the ordinary trap-
pings of a fortified barrier (minefields,
barbed wire, searchlights, watchtowers,
etc.). Along this barrier a four-lane
highway will be built to allow 7 fast troop
movements and provide landing pads
for helicopters.
Technically the project is feasible,
according to engineering reports. It
will take six months to carry out the
survey, then one to two years to build
the 180-mile highway and the fortified
barrier. The costs are estimated at
A "Far Eastern
Economic Review" report from
Ton That Thien in Saigon.
between SA63O and $9OO million. The
labor force needed will be of the order
of 5000 men. Naturally the builders
and their men will need military pro-
tection during both the surveying and
the building phases.
The main problem will be diplomatic,
for the barrier will run a considerable
length on Laotian territory, and there
is an international agreement forbid-
ding the use of Laotian territory by
foreign countries. The agreement was
signed in Geneva in 1962 by 14 nations
On patrol against Vietcong infiltrators
including the Soviet Union and Com-
munist China.
But, the American argument goes,
since the NVA has been violating
Laotian territory, the United States is
also entitled to disregard it. This is
true.
Another alternative more question-
able as to both its wisdom and its
feasibility would be to induce the
Laotian Government to invite American
troops into Laos. Since the Laotian
Premier Souvanna Phouma is happy
or rather unhappy enough with the
present situation, and since the Soviet
Union will surely say “the Americans
go in, let’s go, too,” this latter alterna-
tive is practically ruled out.
But the real obstacle to the project
lies neither in the Geneva agreement of
1962 nor the reluctance of Souvanna
Phouma, but elsewhere. Militarily, there
is no certainty that the fortified barrier
can effectively stop General Vo-
Nguyen-Giap’s troops from entering
South Vietnam. What if his troops enter
the South from under the barrier, for
example?
The VC-NVA have dug. hundreds of
miles of tunnels, probably including
tunnels under the Cambodian border,
and a one-mile or two-mile tunnel under
the barrier would be no problem to
them. And they can surely pick then
entry and exit points between the sea
and the Mekong on a stretch of lot
miles!
More serious is the prospect of the

complete loss of Northern Laos from
just north of Vientiane.
If the Americans move in force into
Southern Laos, then there is no reason
why the NVA will not move in force
into Northern Laos, too, and nothing
can stop them there. The area is hun-
dreds of miles from the sea; there is
practically no road and no airfield
there; if there is a logistic problem it
will be for the Americans and not the
NVA. (Dien Bien Phu has proved this.)
Once entrenched in Northern Laos
the NVA will be in a position to give
real help to the Thai Communists in
the north-east. If one looks at a map
of Thailand the possibility of the
Chinese having access to the Indian
Ocean through North Vietnam, Nor-
thern Laos, and Northern Thailand is
not as absurd as it may seem.
South Korea
Better living
IN MANY CAPITALS of the un-
developed world there are military
leaders with reason to envy South
Korea’s Park Chung Hee his achieve-
ment of something they could not even
attempt—he stood, second time around,
for election in a presidential poll which
observers conceded was, on the whole,
free and fair and won hands down.
It is one thing to come to power
at the head of a military junta, as the
diminutive ex-general did in 1961, and
often quite another thing to stay there;
but the President has no such worries as
South Korea looks ahead to four more
years of the political stability that
emerged from President Park’s first
austere term.
It was the spectacular economic pro-
gress in South Korea —a country that
once seemed hopelessly dependent on
the American dole—that helped Presi-
dent Park to his 1.2 million vote
majority over his principal opponent,
former President Mr. Yun Po Sun.
With the country enjoying political
stability to a degree unknown during the
last presidential elections in 1963, and
facing an Opposition both feeble and
hard pressed to find issues to stand on,
the ruling Democratic Republican
Party and its chief asset, General Park,
had little to fear from free and fair
elections.
The Opposition sought to make some
headway through the longing all
Koreans have for unification of their
country. Forty million Koreans, of
whom about 29 million live in the
South, are probably more homogenous
than the Germans, who are similarly
divided by an artificial boundary
between the Communist East and non-
Communist West.
The Opposition promised, if elected,

The educational system in Australia places

Gathering of facts from various sources is

longer practicable because the information
he seeks he needs today—not in a few
weeks time when that particular volume is

Short of buying some thousand books the

President Park and his wife ... very
confident victory smiles
to try for a new dialogue, on a “people-
to-people” level with the North, perhaps
by allowing some movement of people
across the border.
But the Democratic Republican Party
argued it would be futile and dangerous
for South Korea to make any ges-
ture toward the North before 1970. By
then, as the Prime Minister, Chung II
Kwon, pointed out, South Korea hoped
to be in a strong enough position
economically to bargain with the North
on its own terms, while thanks to rivalry
in the international Communist camp
the North would be infinitely weaker
than it is today—too weak to resist
any overtures.
In all economic categories, South
Korea is rapidly overtaking the North,
which possessed most of the mineral
resources and consequently nearly all
the heavy industry of pre-war Korea.
When President Park assumed con-
trol in the military coup six years ago,
the Republic had only a rudimentary
industrial establishment. Since then the
average South Korean’s share of
national earnings through production of
goods and services has risen 25 percent.
Citizens have better clothing, shops have
a greater variety of goods at prices
people can afford. Change is even more
visible in the appearance of more than
50 major factories and hundreds of new
enterprises of all sizes.
South Korea’s growing enterprises
have swelled its export earnings from
$36 million in 1961 to $225 million in
1966, a gigantic step toward taking the
country off the American dole. “We’ve
merely begun to lay the foundation of
prosperity,” President Park emphasised
m his campaign speeches.
The other principal contest in the
elections concerned South Korea’s in-
volvement in Vietnam, where its 46,000
troops are the largest foreign contin-
gent next to that of the United States.
Here, the New Democratic Party
°Pposition said it was against President
Park’s alleged plan to dispatch more
Korean troops, because of depletion of
Korea’s defences. But the Prime
Minister went on record with a categori-
cal statement that there was no plan
jo send any more troops to Vietnam.
•)° further attack was made on the
Detnam commitment, because it
houses too much national pride.
South Korea now seems to be going
through the phase, which many countries
in Asia and Africa have passed through,
when old westernised liberals—the class
the 70-year-old Edinburgh-educated
Yun Po Sun belongs to —cannot chal-
lenge the growing power of a new
political elite which, without being
bothered too much by “old-fashioned
Western liberal ideas,” has developed a
pragmatic, nationalistic thinking on
issues which concern the country.
The fact that Park Chung Hee never
went abroad for his studies, is essentially
a product of Korea’s argicultural class,
and, above all, has an Army background
makes him an idol of the new power
elite. In a way, Park belongs to the
same class as Ne Win, of Burma, and
Egypt’s Nasser. With time, Park Chung
Hee may grow more and more national-
istic—his anti-Communism is integrated
with his nationalist sentiments. Park
will eventually face opposition where it
is bound to come from—the Left Wing.
It is to his credit that he and his
party seem to be helping this healthy
evolution of political polarisation.
The Rock
Callous tactics
ANGLO-SPANISH RELATIONS have
sunk to a new low. Not just because of
the Spanish Government’s wish to annex
Gibraltar; more because of the ill-
chosen tactics it has adopted for (or
ostensibly for) this purpose. The pros-
pects of an eventual settlement had
been improving by reason of three
trends: Gibraltar’s dwindling value as
a military base; its development of
natural links with Spain; and Britain’s
growing concern to show a European
spirit in dealings with other European
countries. Madrid’s mishandling of the
issue has offset all this. It has severed
most of the Gibraltarians’ links with
Spain, confirmed their worst fears about
its intentions toward them, and obliged
Britain to promise to sustain them
indefinitely, even if the base loses all
its value. So far, Franco’s only gain
from all this lies in the value of the
Gibraltar quarrel as a distraction for his
own people when his government is
beset by spreading discontent.
The petty cruelties involved in Spain’s
method of putting the squeeze on the
Gibraltarians have been repellent. Since
1964 Spanish officials have so increased
the obstruction of border crossings as

the Communists in East Germany. They
have driven many Gibraltarians, over-
night, out of homes they had long
occupied in Spain. They have abruptly
robbed two thousand Spanish women

Predictably, Madrid officials have

the Gibraltar question and the new ban

on all flights over the nearest parts of
Spain, which Britain is now contestino
on the ground that it involves an
unreasonable and hazardous interference
with established air traffic, and thus
infringes the code of the International
Civil Aviation Organisation.
A high point in humbug was touched
last October, when Madrid claimed that
the further squeeze it then applied was
merely a bit of self-defence made neces-
sary by an “act of aggression” Britain
had committed in July. The dire deed
of July turned out to consist of a sen-
tence included in a British offer to
demolish the fifty-year-old frontier fence
Gibraltar... it was occupied by the
British before New Zealand
(Spain rejected the offer, though it had
requested the demolition a few weeks
earlier). In the aggressive sentence,
Spain’s representatives alleged, Britain
extended its territorial claims up to the
frontier “for the first time.” They
insisted that the flat ground between the
frontier and the northern face of the
actual Rock was “Spanish territory on
which no negotiation is possible.”
There is no possibility of the British
Government yielding the half-mile in
question. The British have occupied it
since some years before they occupied
New Zealand, before the Americans
took possession of California, before
Italy became a united nation. Small as
it is on the map, it contains the airfield
that is vital for Gibraltar’s tourist trade
as well as for general communication.
The Spanish Government’s aim is not
to oust the British from their Gibraltar
base (it has offered Britain continuing
base facilities) but to impose its rule
on the Gibraltarians, while at the same
time treating them so callously as to
eliminate any hope that they might
freely entrust themselves to its care.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
With a degree of permanence
By PATRICIA ROLFE
THE ELIZABETHAN OPERA COM-
PANY begins its main season this year
with several advantages it has not had
before: subscriptions, including youth
subscriptions, its own 45-member orches-
tra, a repertoire of seven operas, and
Mr. Harry Miller in charge of promo-
tion.
These, together with increased finan-
cial help from the N.S.W. State Govern-
ment, its mind on the yawning empti-
nesses of the Opera House rather than
on opera, may finally secure perm-
anence instead of the stop-and-start
existence of the past decade for the
company. The company, members of
which are on season contracts, carries
one opera, “II Trovatore,” over from
last year. Some of the opera seen in
some cities this year will not be seen
in others until next year. In fact, the
company’s activities from year to year
now seem so enmeshed that it might
be much more difficult in future to cut
short its existence.
The company begins its main season
in Canberra on May 30 and has already
been fully booked out there, Mr. Miller
proclaiming that the Opera Company
now has more subscribers than the ABC
symphony concert series has in that
city. However, older hands at selling
opera to Australians can think of many
reasons for Canberra’s enthusiasm, in-
cluding the recent shortage of any
theatrical activity for one, and are more
impressed that subscriptions have gone
w r ell in both Brisbane and Adelaide.
The company, of about 50 singers in
addition to the orchestra, is doing “Don
Pasquale,” “Tosca,” “Turandot,” “The
Flying Dutchman,” “Don Giovanni,”
“II Trovatore,” and “Rigoletto,” al-
though no city will see all of these
this year.
The Elizabethan seems to have given
up importing singers of the standard
set a few years ago by the soprano
w'hose main contribution to Australian
opera to cuff a critic across the
face with her glove. This year’s sole
import is Marcella Reale, Italian-bom
American who has just finished a season
at San Carlo. She will sing Senta in
“The Flying Dutchman” and Donna
Anna in “Don Giovanni.”
The opera people are perhaps more
elated that Brisbane-born Donald Smith,
who was here from Europe last year
for “II Trovatore,” will return this year
for some additional performances of this
opera and to sing Calaf in “Turandot”
and the Duke in “Rigoletto.” Mr.
Smith has decided to live in Australia
again, or, rather, to use it as his base
from now on. Also returning is Mr.
Raymond Myers, who recently sang the
leading role in “The Servant of Two
Masters” with the New York City Opera
at the Lincoln Centre. Mr. Myers will
sing the title roles in “Rigoletto” and
“The Flying Dutchman.”
A bonus for the Elizabethan is Morag
Beaton, who came here with the Suther-
land-Williamson company, returned
early this year to live in Sydney simply
because she likes it, and almost literally
knocked on the door of the Elizabethan
asking for work. Miss Beaton will sing
the role of Princess Turandot in Puc-
cini’s “Turandot” and Maddelana in
“Rigoletto.”
The youth subscriptions, with an age
limit of 26, will be for Monday night

Theatre
Kerr country
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
“There’s a Girl in My Soup.” Terence
Frisby. Royal, Sydney.
“The Owl and the Pussycat.” Bill
Manhoff. Ensemble, Sydney.
THIS WEEK we have two comedies,
one from London, one from Broadway,
both about sex.
To say that “There’s a Girl in My
Soup” is about the sex-life of a cook
would be accurate but misleading. For
Ron Randell, alias Robert Danvers, is
no ordinary cook, but another Graham
Kerr. He makes lots of money by cook-
ing on television, writing cookery books,
and doing a regular feature for a
fashionable magazine, edited by Ray
Taylor. However, it is my opinion that
Robert Danvers is no more Graham
Kerr than Ray Taylor is the editor of
“The Bulletin.” His favored method
of making breakfast is to send out to
the nearest pastrycook’s. A splendid
idea, but not what we used to call
cooking, in Oldspeak.
But Danvers, laboriously established
though he is as a middle-aged Don
Juan, a seedy survivor from an extinct
species of play, is really only there as
a foil to the witty, pretty, mini-skirted
girl who provides the occasion for a
dazzling performance by young Eng-
lish actress Amanda Reiss. The play
is a tasteless vehicle, although it
improves as it goes on, but, if you
can put up with it, you will see a
consummate piece of acting.
Ron Randell is looking fit, as we
have plenty of opportunity to observe,
since, in this play, the man does most
of the undressing. Amanda Reiss takes
off her minimum dress, which ends
where her legs begin, once only, and
then her lace-edged underwear looks
more formal than her outerwear. Kerry
Francis, fully but informally dressed,
is amusing in the part of her errant
boyfriend, the lino-layer.
“The Owl and the Pussycat” is about
a writer and a prostitute. Once upon
a time prostitutes appeared in literature
as romantic creatures, victims of cruel
circumstances, who were either stoical
and golden-hearted or pale and
spiritual. Nowadays their image has
John Macleod and Patricia Jones in
“The Owl and the Pussycat." Ensemble,
Sydney
become rather drab: one tends to think
of them as social problems. With afflu-
ence and increased job-mobility, pros-
titution has become just another way of
earning a living, but one without
security or social cachet. The take-
home money may be good, but there
are no fringe-benefits.
In fact, the girl in this play does not
seem like a prostitute at all, but the
author is old-fashioned enough to sup-
pose that saying she was would make
his play more colorful.
It is one of those wearing American
plays in which everybody shouts all
the time. Actually, there are only two
characters, but they make enough
noise for half a dozen. Patricia Jones
and John Macleod would do better to
vary the tone, as the monotony has a
numbing effect.
Children's fare

Mr. Hump’s Hat. Pennington Hall,
North Adelaide.
The Clown Who Ran Away. Theatie
62, Hilton, S.A.
Pygmalion. Shaw. St. Peter’s Hall,
Glenelg, S.A.
THE CHILDREN’S PLAYS at Pen-
nington Hall and Theatre 62 show
themselves to be descended from the
Christmas pantomimes one saw as a
child and which one ranked equal with
royal shows and circuses. As an intro-
duction to theatre for children between
three and nine, they are ideal.
The Pennington Hall production of
“Mr. Hump’s Hat” is directed by
Marie Tomasetti for The Childrens
Theatre of S.A. Miss Tomasetti was one
of the first to introduce theatre for
children to South Australia, and has
made a particular study here and m
England of its very exacting techniques.
This production is in a brightly lit hall
on a stage set with several appropri-
ately decorated flats and platforms. The
action takes place on stage, forestage,


KURDISH RUG
This rug was woven by Kurdish weavers
in North West Iran. The double geometric
medallion is typical and the motifs derive
from ancient tribal lore. This is a semi-
antique rug with the ground colour of
natural camel (a feature of older rugs)
and mellow orange and amber tones.
WHY SHOULD I OWN
AN ORIGINAL
ORIENTAL CARPET?
Oriental carpets are not ordinary-
carpets. Each one is individual —a
unique combination of color, of
ancient traditional design and the
personality of its weaver. In the
great variety of their patterns, these
rugs express the art of the nomadic
tribesmen and peasants of Western
Asia and the ancient Persian cities.
They are natural carpets, entirely
hand-made, of handspun wools,
vegetable-dyed to mellow and grow
more beautiful with use.
If you consider your furnishings are
ordinary, mass-produced, unimagina-
tive, try the effect of an original
Oriental rug in your room. Discover
the distinction your decor immedi-
ately acquires and the individual
touch it gives to your home. Some
are so elegant with traditional
furniture, others are a masterstroke
with modern.
When you purchase an Oriental
carpet you acquire an asset. These
rugs are hand-knotted to withstand
from 30-80 years hard use. Like
antique furniture they gain in beauty
and value with age. They are an
internationally accepted investment.

and in the auditorium itself, and is
basically about a magic hat which gets
stuck on Mr. Hump’s head. The chil-
dren are progressively brought into the
action. An excellent cast, led by Desi
Moore, very ably controls and elicits
a variety of responses from the children.
They are required to help the cast
remove the hat, and they do this in a
series of music and movement exercises
in which such things as fire, fishes, trees,
and birds are acted out by all and
sundry.
Theatre 62’s “The Clown Who Ran
Away” is a more conventional and a
more lavish production than “Mr.
Hump,” and contains a series of stan-
dard story-book types such as Dodo the
Clown, walking and talking dolls
(played very effectively by children),
nasty robbers, comic street scenes, a
heroic horse, and a stern policeman.
Produced by Richard Davey, it is very
colorfully dressed, appropriately set,
and flamboyantly acted.
The St. Peter’s Society’s production
of “Pygmalion” shows how well a good
play can survive time, the “My Fair
Lady” treatment, and even a shallow,
inept production. The stage at St.
Peter’s Hall is small, but in this produc-
tion by Norman Mac Lucas it is
crammed with so many tarty props that
the cast find even vertical movement
hard.
One performance saves what could
be a dismal night, and that is Lucy
Osborn’s Eliza Doolittle. Miss Osborn
has an innate sense of timing, a crisp,
clear voice, and she alone managed to
move meaningfully through the bric-a-
brac.
Music
Half-strength
By PAUL FROLICH
Abbey Simon, pianist. Direction, ABC;
Sydney Town Hall.
THE PIANO is, basically, a set of
strings hit by hammers, but most
present-day pianists seem to be aware
of the hammers only. Abbey Simon, by
contrast, is rather an anachronism. He
shows a tender regard for the sounding
of the strings, and his playing is fre-
quently distinguished by the frailest of
pianissimi. If even Mr. Simon manages
to do violence to some music it is not,
at least, to music written for the piano
in the first place.
Lucl ily for us, Mr. Simon’s violence
came fight at the beginning of the
recital, giving us a chance to forget it
during the satisfying and musicianly
performances that followed. The offence
)vas perpetrated on Bach’s C minor
loccata, the author of the transcription
remaining unnamed. In this music Mr.
mmon gave a gross 19th-century per-
ormance with heavy pedalling; the
playing was romantic and persuasively
pianistic but with very little respect for
Bach.
If Mr. Simon’s playing lacks any-
thing (other than avoidance of Bach)
it is a truly emphatic fortissimo. He is
not an athletic player, and his music,
though finely contrasted and careful of
nuances, moves between forte and
pianissimo. This absence of the last
thing in strength was noticeable in
Brahms’ F minor sonata, opus 5, the
last of the composer’s three piano
sonatas. The work was written when
Brahms was barely 20, the second and
fourth movements shortly before he met
the Schumanns in Dusseldorf in Septem-
ber, 1853. Predictably, the parts written
after that momentous encounter show
Schumann’s influence, particularly in
the Scherzo. This rarely heard sonata
is a great pianistic challenge, and Mr.
Simon’s reading of it was persuasive and
thoroughly romantic, even if it did not
attain Katchen’s miraculous clarity and
confident style.
The second half of the recital was
devotpd to Chopin and Ravel.
“Alborada del Gracioso” was the only
work which calls for percussive playing,
and this, in Simon’s interpretation, was
rather pallid. But his playing of
Chopin’s three Impromptus and the now
rarely heard Fantasie Impromptu were
among the finest I’ve heard for a long
time. Mr. Simon does not play Chopin
in the grand, the Polish, manner that
Slavic and German pianists have accus-
tomed us to. His view of Chopin is,
legitimately, I think, as of a courtly
Frenchman who wrote music of an
exquisite delicacy, relieved by poetic
sparkle. Many listeners, no doubt,
longed for the histrionics that most
pianists invest Chopin’s music with; I
was utterly charmed by Mr. Simon’s
lovely tone, sensitive touch, and finely
phrased rubato passages.
The evening’s finest moment came
with Ravel’s “Oiseaux Tristes,” rarely
attempted by anyone now; it was a
whispering little gem of sleepy bird
sounds, hardly ever more exquisitely or
delicately played.
Art
Burst of life
By ELWYN LYNN
Ron Upton, Drawings. Watters Gallery,
Sydney.
Black and White. Central Street,
Sydney.
Aspects of New British Art. Art Gallery
of N.S.W., Sydney.
Engine. Blaxland Galleries, Sydney.
John Olsen. Clune Galleries, Sydney.
THE ABOVE are not all the current
shows that suddenly make Sydney look
like a sophisticated and cosmopolitan
city. Tests of taste and opportunities
to reassess abound; for example, some


found Upton’s grey drawings of obese
nudes, with limbs turning into pulpy
tentacles, repulsive; but, then, obesity is
the Modern Sin. Medievalists might get
more pleasure from his fine danses
macabres of dry, clattering white bones
on black.
There was none of this menace
except for Watkins’ black, wooden
•gibbet-sculpture —amid the crisp black,
white and grey abstracts at Central,
where shaped canvases by McGillick
were pure black and those by Schlicht
toughened by black and white scalloped
shapes that suddenly reversed their
directions. In a show that was treated
too cursorily by commentators there
were challenging works, including
Wendy Paramor’s finely attuned white,
heraldic foliage on black. Once the
British show has been digested, it
should be clearer how well the Central
artists have grasped international
idioms.
A number of the British painters at
the Art Gallery of N.S.W. have come
to their present modes through tachism
and a loose, painterly approach to Pop,
and the danger is, amid so much crisp
and positive painting in Sydney, that
British subtlety might be confused with
carelessness, clumsiness, and casualness.
Yet one has doubts about the non-
chalance because the best, like Allen
Jones’ bus of streaming red banners,
with two small canvases to hold wheels
below, Harold Cohen’s floating islands
in tachists seas, Bridget Riley’s optical
swerves and dots, and Gillian Ayres’
dynamic flat patterns, are well made.
On the other hand, some of the less
successful work, like Bernard Cohen’s
empty gestures, Hoy land’s jelly-beans
stuck in bitter green, and Walker’s
sausage balloons adrift in blank can-
vases, are sloppy, and in between is the
excellent, offhand sketchiness of Mundy
(the older masters of this, Heron and
Scott, are not in the show) and Richard
Smith’s YRS with its shimmering, drift-
ing, out-of-focus imagery. Other more
formal and skilfully made works were
not impressive: Turnbull’s stripe or
twisting ribbon on uniform backgrounds
and Furnival’s black, red, or orange
lettering, stark on fawn canvases, needed
the subtlety of Sedgley’s equidistant
glowing dots on hexagonal shapes or
the little kaleidoscopic shapes that Jack
Smith lets stray amid rigid lines. In
examining this interesting show, that I
may deal with in greater detail, one
can test another by what he says his
works are: “diagrams of an experience
or sensation.”
There’s the rub. Can the diagram
be the vehicle of the experiences of
three engineers, Syd Ball, Reinhard,
and Jordan, in an excellently arranged
display at Farmer’s? The title over-
emphasises the premeditation of the
works, just as the photographs over-
stress environment origins: Jordan’s
stripes slide off the simple-angled forms
and slabs he employs; in Bridget Riley
the optical ploys are the form, Jordan’s
contradict and subvert the three-
dimensional forms they cover in an
unengineered manner. Ball, whose easy
assurance is only equalled by Harold
Cohen and Jack Smith among the
British painters, employs the intuitive
geometry of Persian painting in
Isfahan (the triumph of the show),
where two symmetrically placed arrow-
heads, each with bands of dark blue,
red, and yellow, approach, point tp
point, over an ochre field. The same
momentary arrest of movement is what
his undulating red slippery-dip is about.
Reinhard’s arrows, except one that
tends to rotate a red box sunk through
a white table hung from the ceiling
a bit of hygienic surrealism stand
still and the transparent tubes that links
perspex boxes and nudes in silhouette
or photograph are cui'iously empty, for
it’s an uncanny airless, still world of
medical tubes and grey nudes. Perhaps
it is meant to have some of the meticu-
lous engineering of a modern mortuary.
New Yorker Paul Thek runs such
tubes to wax models of bloody flesh,
but his aim is to confront amorphous
meat with technical precision . . . but
I see that Susan Sontag has dedicated
her Against Interpretation to Thek
and she warns us that “In most modern
instances, interpretation amounts to the
philistine refusal to leave the work of
art alone”; still Reinhard ought to be
less clinically coy.
In an era of hard-edge and unequivo-
cal aims, eclecticism, however valid, can
look too obvious; it occurs within
Olsen’s show, where the tapestries
dispositions of pale, flat forms have
little to do with his linear abstraction
(excellent in the drawings) still wind-
ing through COBRA country and
pausing to look at Alan Davie, but shy-
ing off his obsessive, clear-cut forms.
Joie de vivre is the spirit, I’m told; I
think there is some anxiety and in
several greenish works a new acerbity;
some flop around a little desperately
and there is nothing here as good as
his first tapestry and his Pilgrim’s Pro-
gress, both of 1965. Young Australian
and British pilgrims find it so easy; the
middle years can be tough but eventu-
ally more rewarding.
Confrontation
By BERNARD SMITH
Elwyn Lynn. Kym Bonython’s Hungry
Horse, Sydney.
THE TEXTURE PAINTINGS by
Elwyn Lynn reveal a development
within a now well-established personal
style. Two years ago Lynn’s work was
more lyrical, that is to say his surfaces
were essentially harmonic in their con-
tinuities: the colors muted to neutral
greys, buffs, and red-browns; the
textures, for the most part evenly
wrought, rarely disrupted by intimations
of violence. What was evoked, and
evocation is close to the heart of this
kind of painting, was not only the signs
of age but also the signs of continuity
Visual flow was all.
And to some extent it still is; f or
the basic structure of the style remains
But now there is a greater stiffening 0 f
the forms, more compositional thrust
more direct and static confrontation
between beholder and image. We are no
longer permitted to absorb the pictorial
harmonics in peace and accept them
as an image of cosmic or human order
The exhibition testifies to the transi-
tion. The “earlier” manner is present
in such paintings as Charybdis, Drift
Battle Plan, and Hungland. Here the
continuities and rhythmical flow domi-
nate the structure. But paintings such
as Shore, Mandala, Motonaga, and
Sealed Land confront the beholder
square on and more statically. Tones
are more contrasted, forms more sym-
metrical. An emblematic, heraldic, at
times almost hieratic, presence occa-
sionally emerges, as in Sealed Land.
One of the effects of the change is
to assert more firmly than before the
physical existence of the materials and
not prevent them from disappearing in
an even flow of seductive visual undula-
tions. Lynn builds up his evocative
pastes by mixtures of plaster, sand, grit,
rice paper, and PVA. These are then
sun-dried and pressed, kneaded, torn, or
cut. Further texturing being attained by
scouring, rubbing, and painting to create
effects of time akin to “undercleaned”
paintings.
Textures of this kind create highly
evocative surfaces. Such means have
been employed, of course, for their own
expressive purposes by Dubuffet,
Tapies, Burri, and others. And what is
evoked, however varied, wayward, and
apparently irrational it may be, tends
to find a focus in the ideas and experi-
ences associated with age. For that
which is new and young tends to be
smooth, firm-edged, and clear; age is
corrugated, roughened, textured.
Time’s cracks and erosions, then, are
simulated by these paintings. The sun
itself works the changes more delicately,
more rhythmically, than where Lynn
the artist works directly upon the
material. And this metaphor of man
as dominator and intruder is surely
built into these paintings in the firm
gashes of red which disrupt the gentle
nuances of a picture like Posted, in a
manner akin to Burri’s bleeding sacks,
or in those recurrent little seals in such
paintings as Sealed Land, which strike
one at once as so absurd and so final.
To enlarge upon the evocations of
Lynn’s paintings will seem highly
irrelevant to the purist. But paint is
only paint when it is in the pot, can,
or tube. To paint is to intend to paint;
and out of intention, and often despite
conscious intention, expressions and
meanings emerge which are an inalien-
able part of the very stuff of painting.
Altogether a handsome exhibition by
an accomplished artist.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Doing a good job for Australia
MR. McEWEN is doing a damn good job. Despite the
drearily vituperative dispatches from the “Economist’s”
Canberra correspondent (“Mr. McEwen’s protectionist ful-
minations have reached a pitch of fury . . .” was last
week’s nonsense), the Trade Minister’s efforts have achieved
a great deal for this country in recent weeks. The
“Economist’s” quaint suggestion that Australia had no case
at all for a higher wheat price (as the world’s cheapest
producer we have had to pay $2O million a year to subsidise
its production), and its local correspondent’s attempts to
picture McEwen as an angry old general with no army
behind him, may be recognisably absurd in Australia, where
they can be seen in the context of the power struggle (in
which the “Economist’s” local man plays such a large part)
between the two Departments of Treasury and Trade.
But there can be no doubting the damage this abuse of
McEwen and belittling of Trade can do to Australia’s
position in international negotiations
Following last week’s hectic end to the Kennedy Round,
we have come out with what looks like a ten percent better
wheat price, with an exemption from the “across-the-board”
straight-line tariff reduction of one-third that the major
countries have agreed to (so we can select our areas of
concession), and with our bargaining position in a far
better shape than could be expected in the context of
Britain’s present application to join the Common Market.
For Britain’s timing of her application meant that Australia’s
scope for auctioning off its British preferential tariff in
bilateral deals as a genuine tariff concession was severely
diminished. (It’s hard to sell something you look like
losing anyway.) The longer General de Gaulle keeps making
such unfriendly sounds as last week’s about British entry,
the better for our chances in using the otherwise-doomed
preferential arrangements as a negotiable item.
And now that we have a better wheat price (and pros-
pects of new meat and sugar agreements) we may as well
forget about any more real concessions from Europe if
Britain does get in; the U.K.’s relations with Australia
may be important out here, but they are certainly not an
issue of major importance in these negotiations. It is going
to take some hefty horse-trading by Mr. McEwen and his
department to rescue much more.
MEN AND MATTERS
IT WAS ONLY 20 years ago that
dad and the Foyster boys were digging
up the -black sand that stretched along
the beach not so very far from their
banana farm on the Tweed River in
northern N.S.W., putting it into bags
and sending it off to the Americans.
Now they are all millionaires.
And so respectability (and responsi-
bility) has brought an end to an era,
the rough, tough, feuding days have
gone in the beach-sands business (even
the Murphys and the Foysters are
mates again). Last week’s settlement out
of court of a s4£-million claim against
the Foyster family (for $25,000) on a
dispute over mining rights was prob-
ably the last glimmer of the old Foyster
image.
The Foyster saga began toward the
end of the war when John Alexander
Foyster and his wife Olga took out a
rutile-zircon lease, which they did not
have enough money to work properly
until 1947. The family partnership,
which took in their four sons, Clive,
Mark, Lloyd, and John, became
Cudgeon RZ Ltd., which was listed on
the Stock Exchange last week after
$l.B million of its shares were placed
with the public (they immediately
almost doubled in price, making the
Foyster family holding worth about
$lO million.
Their father has been ill for some
time, and now the two oldest sons
(both in their late
30s) run the two
Foyster public
companies: Clive
is managing direc-
tor of Consoli-
dated Rutile (he
has 32 - year - old
Lloyd also on his
board) and Mark
is managing direc-
tor of Cudgeon
RZ (where his
father is also on
the board with
young John, who is still in his 20s).
The two companies have no common
directors, even though the boys hold
shares in both, and their father is insis-
tent on their independence of each
other.
But Lloyd takes no active part in
the compay apart from being a director,
and is setting up a racehorse stud near
Mudgee (he has been keen on horses
all his life) in which the youngest
brother, John, has a stake.
THE LOT OF young executives can
encompass plenty of variety. Take 36-
year-old Robert S. Gardiner, managing
director of the local E. R. Squibb and
Sons. Three years after graduating from
Trinity College, Melbourne, he joined
the firm in 1954 when it was a small
importing and distributing show with
one room for an office upstairs in a
Lloyd Foyster
R. S. Gardiner
John Foyster
Manchester Lane building, next to
Newspaper House in Collins Street.
At last week’s opening of the com-
pany’s spanking new $1 million factory
at Noble Park, Mr. Gardiner had more
VIPs on his plate than seen at any
similar ceremony in Australia for years.
There were not only such high-powered
people like John J. McCloy, inter alia
chairman of the parent U.S. company,
and top executives from various of its
world network of operations such as
Italy and Japan, but also a galaxy of
local notables like the PM.
Gardiner’s father was an Englishman
who met his mother in the backblocks
of Queensland and took her back to
England, where the son was born.
Robert jun. returned when he was 17,
and, after graduating, took his first busi-
ness job with Gollin and Co. in Mel-
bourne.


Barometric indicators
THE RETAIL, building, and motor trades are three of Aus-
tralia’s most sensitive business barometers. Last week’s news
0 f a bumper result from Myers, a whopping loss from
Volkswagen, and modest (though pleasing enough) progress
from the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation certainly
gave plenty of variety to the economic scene.
Myers’ result simply confirms that Australia-wide per-
sonal spending has been much freer over the past year.
Nor, as Kenneth Myer attests in his provisional report, has
; t yet tightened up, say in tune with the current big
“dry” (as distinct from drought), the failure of industrial
production to move as fast as the boomers thought it was
going to, and the tighter general liquidity position occa-
sioned by the Treasury’s seasonal squeeze and the weaken-
ing balance of payments position and prospect. We seem
to have the accommodating mood of the banking system
to thank mostly for that.
It would be pleasing to think that, having now pushed
u p its insuring rate to ssm. a month and insured more
than s36m. housing loans in all! in its 18 months’ life, the
Housing Loans Insurance Corporation was now having a
noticeable effect on house building. But, with the industry
itself little more than coasting along, this cannot be said
with any certainty, despite the Corporation’s growing use-
fulness to an increasing number of its approved lenders,
the wider geographical spread of its business, and its
facilitation of low-deposit loans. It has not made all that
much impact on the flow of new money into housing as
yet and what it has so far has been mostly through
permanent building societies. N.S.W. accounts for about
half of its insured loans and Victoria for most of the
rest. The development of a market in HLIC-insured mort-
gages, which was expected to assist the flow of funds into
housing considerably, has been rather hanging fire.
Volkswagen’s big loss, like Ford’s the year before,
shouldn’t be taken too tragically in the general economic
context, or that of the motor industry’s overall situation.
Except perhaps to Mr. Alan Gray, whose German superiors
sacked him from the company’s top executive job for
making only a smallish profit a couple of years ago, it is
not a cause for any satisfaction, either. Obviously, VW has
been stung more than any of the big motor manufacturers
by the requirement to increase the Australian content of
vehicles. To make matters worse, its sales have slipped in
an improved (but not by all that much) market (for the
four months to the end of April, new registrations were up
only six percent on the subdued like-period last year).
Subscribers please note
POSTCODE, the Post Office’s new locational code, is a
sensible innovation: helpful in simplifying addresses and
necessary to Post Office efficiency. The problem will be
to get people using it; no one took any notice of the
brave attempt to do something like this in the 19505. The
PMG Department plans a major publicity campaign, but
rill this be enough? It may be necessary to give people
an incentive to use it: First by making sure their “post-
coded” mail gets handled quicker and this fact is adver-
tised, and second by allowing them to omit from the address
the name of the town which the postcode number is
intended to replace.
The postcode could be used in telephone directories to
remind people of it. And while on the subject, why not
include all post office box numbers, as well as addresses,
in the telephone book. The Post Office has always said it
wants people to address mail to business houses via their
post office box rather than by street name and number,
and this would be a simple way of giving post box numbers
publicity.
The upshot of all this would be that all those thousands
°f people writing in for subscriptions to The Bulletin would
save a lot of ink. Instead of addressing their envelopes to
The Subscriptions Department, The Bulletin, Park House,
54-58 Park St., Sydney, they could write, Subscriptions,
Box 4088/2001.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The latest employment statis-
tics, for April, revealed an almost stable labor market;
registrants, at 64,046, were 811 under their March
level, while vacancies dropped a couple of hundred to
36,652.
April’s new motor vehicle registrations, a seasonally
adjusted 34,600, attained the best height since August,
1965, and 2000 above March’s figure; motor cycles
are displaying an obvious increase.
The May Commonwealth Loan brought in s69m.
to give a four-loan 1966-67 total of $555m., against
1965- $464m.
Ten months’ wool sales, to April, realised $585.3m.,
just above the corresponding $579m. for April, 1966.
For the markets: Metals and oils have been
given their heads on Australian share markets; most
industrial sections remain moribund, with BHP mainly
calling the index changes.
A broad retreat among London industrials was
provoked by Middle East and Hong Kong troubles, and
poor employment statistics . . . Wall Street went back
on active dealings, although silver issues rose well.
For companies: Oil and minerals between them
crowned the week, continuing to raise great implications
for the future of the Australian economy . . . “Liquid
hydrocarbons” gave the first clue from Esso-BHP’s
Gippsland offshore Kingfish A-l well, later confirmed
(in a qualified manner) as oil; the partners followed
this up with plans to produce stabilised crude oil and
liquefied petroleum gas at Western Port, near Mel-
bourne . . . Wapet’s Pascoe Island No. 1 well (five
miles south of Barrow) flowed oil and is coring ahead
. . . Woodside and its partners at Golden Beach (off-
shore Gippsland) report gas shows, to be tested later
. . . Duarran No. 2, eight miles south of Roma, and
drilled by the Associated Oil group, produced the
biggest Queensland oil flow since Alton.
Can Western Mining be far behind? Japan’s Sumi-
tomo Metal is to take 40,000 tons of 15 percent (con-
centrate) nickel from Kambalda; deliveries under, a
ten-year contract start in September . . . Conzinc
Riotinto has reached agreement with the Federal
Government and the Papua-New Guinea Administration
to push ahead with Bougainville copper.
On a more mundane level, Kathleen Investments
doubled its profit to $557,852 and paid out $67,000
more with a 25 percent dividend . . . Mount Isa’s
copper output is still much below levels of a year
ago; lead and zinc production has moved up a little
. . . Rationalisation comes to Kalgoorlie’s Golden Mile:
Great Boulder and Lake View and Star propose to
merge leases and operations; Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie
(Aust.) will also absorb some of Great Boulder’s leases
to allow a possible joint venture at greater depth.
Two industrial leaders, at least, staked their claims
. . . N.Z. and South-East Asian activities helped ACI
to a peak $9,871,000 (up $260,683) profit, and the
usual ten percent on a 20.1 percent earning rate . . .
Myer Emporium earned $7,780,713 (previously
$6,186,947) in six months to January on 11.1 percent
more sales, and predicts a better full year.
Building materials supplier Wunderlich achieved
record sales, yet profits fell to ten percent to $821,033
. . . Seven percent lower sales still allowed Kauri to
earn a half-year’s $50,947, against a corresponding
$83,684 loss.
Kiwi International’s public flotation comprises two
million $1 shares issued at $1.20 . . . Gordon and Gotch
is to make a one-for-ten issue at 100 percent premium;
1966- earnings have increased slightly.
Spring and brake engineer Pioneer Industries has
received a $1,310,322 cash takeover offer from the U.S.

McEwen’s new brainchild
Treading on Treasury flower beds
By CROESUS
WHEN YOU’RE on a good thing,
such as we are in receiving a massive
spontaneous inflow of overseas private
capital, the commonsense course, as it
seems to me, is to let it run on for
you of its own accord. To start dic-
tating terms can upset the whole apple-
cart. The trouble is that the good
thing may not be wholly to your liking
and the temptation to improve it more
to your liking is strong.
In the case of overseas capital
inflow, there are two things not much
to our liking. One is that Australians
are not getting as much of the equity
of the projects overseas capital is
largely financing. The other is that too
much of the capital coming is in
equity rather than loan form. In its
wisdom, the Government has long been
turning a blind eye to these two aspects,
even though paying lip service to them
on occasion.
It has certainly not taken the view
that foreign investors will respond to
the attractions of this country for
investment if we manipulate the terms
of its entry more to suit ourselves. It
has rather looked at it the other way
and this could well be more apposite,
especially in present circumstances when
export capital is now tight in overseas
capital markets and our own intake is
falling. Rather than putting obstacles
in its way, the Government has been
searching possible courses for making
Australia a more attractive magnet for
overseas capital. Moreover, it has found
one - the institution of a low flat
rate of with-holding tax payable on
interest on private overseas loan capital
to replace the 42| percent tax liability
such interest attracts at present.
But clearly not all members of Cabi-
net are looking squarely in this latter
direction, not by any means. Probably
feeling more strongly than other
Ministers about the thin slices of equity
going to Australians but, admittedly not
strongly enough, fortunately, to impede
the spontaneous inflow of private capital
by imposing stricter terms for its entry,
Mr. McEwen, who has been thinking
aloud on the problem for years, has
come up with this ingenious scheme to
establish a Government overseas borrow-
ing corporation. This is not so much
aimed to increase the inflow of capital,
it seems, as to serve the object of giving
Australians a bigger share in the equity
of development projects here.
As Mr. lan Sinclair, his deputy at
the Ministry of Trade, has explained:
You set up an Australian Government
corporation to borrow funds on fixed
interest overseas, you lend the proceeds
of the loans to Australians on preferen-
tial terms to take up equity in new
development projects, and then “in
appropriate cases” you allow the over-
seas lenders to take up “at some future
time a small slice of the equity in a
successfully developed enterprise.” I n
other words you push foreign capital,
or at least any that can be attracted
which might not be all that much with
all the other spontaneous channels of
entry still open, from the thick to the
thin end of the equity wedge.
Basically the soundness of the pro-
posal rests on the likelihood of such
a corporation increasing the net inflow
of capital into the country. If it fails
that test, the prospect of it increasing
the participation of Australians in the
equity of local projects would seem to
be minimal. In any event, its net effect
on overall capital inflow at the best
of times would be difficult to assess,
the more so when as at present capital
inflow is falling. I would say it is an
even-money bet that more often than
not funds raised overseas by such a
corporation would be at the expense
of an inflow from some other source.
Furthermore, I believe that the chances
of such a corporation borrowing sums
large enough to make more than a
pinprick on the balance of Australian
and foreign equity participation would
be extremely small. This also seems to
be the view of Mr. D. J. Hibberd,
managing director of Comalco and
formerly a Treasury man.
The results of Comalco’s capital
search efforts and those of others in
the United States speak volumes for
the direct method of enlisting loan
finance (the type the corporation would
be looking for exclusively) on the basis
of hard-and-fast commercial proposi-
tions, whereas there are no precedents
of an Australian Government raising
private capital overseas for relending
for non-Government projects (there are
innumerable ones of Government bor-
rowing overseas for public sector
development, of course). If overseas bor-
rowing of loan capital by the proposed
corporation would be a shot in the dark,
the direct approach to overseas capital
markets by Australian companies has
proved its worth time and time again,
even despite the failure (until recently)
of the Government to recognise the
absurdity of the interest payable on such
borrowings attracting tax at company
tax rates.
The legislation to be introduced later
this year to replace company tax (4-2
percent) rates on such interest pay-
ments by a 10 percent flat rate with-
holding tax would seem to advance
the two main causes espoused by the
Department of Trade’s proposal much
more realistically than the proposa
itself. This is because it will increase

attraction of fixed-interest loans
vis-a-vis equity investment by overseas
investors, in that the new impost of
10 percent is considerably lower than
the present rates of the dividend with-
holding tax (general 30 percent and
half that for Australian dividend recipi-
ents in countries having double taxa-
tion agreements with us). As Mr. Stani-
forth Ricketson pointed out last week,
this situation should be of considerable
interest to investors in European and
Far East countries, with whom we have
n 0 double taxation agreements. In fact,
on any Australian fixed-interest security
held by residents in countries having no
such agreements, they will pay a lower
rate of tax than residents in countries
with double tax agreements will pay on
dividends received from Australian
companies.
Without prejudice to the possibilities
seen by the Department of Trade in its
proposal, the institution of the low with-
holding tax should in itself swing the
pendulum more toward fixed-interest
borrowing overseas, but neither the pro-
posed corporation nor the new tax ex-
haust the practical course open to get a
bigger equity participation. The most
obvious of these courses is to restore
the convertible note to its pre-
November, 1960, tax position by making
interest on it tax deductible.
A number of protagonists of this
suggestion, from big lenders of local
money for overseas-owned corporations
operating here to stockbrokers like Mr.
Ricketson, consider the neglect of this
course is pathetic. Provided the Govern-
ment reinstalled the convertible note
with appropriate safeguards such as to
the length of the currency and the pro-
portion of capital allowed in that form,
Ricketson is in favor, despite the impli-
cation, as explained by him, that the
convertible note would serve the over-
seas lender as any equally good route
into local equity as it would local
lenders. However sensible it is to give
them to local institutions, we don’t want
to get into the position where overseas
lenders will only put up fixed-interest
money on condition that convertibility
tags are attached.
This is something the Treasury should
have another look at before the Budget,
if only to show the Department of
Trade it still has some tricks up its
sleeve on the equity participation ques-
tion and that an overseas borrowing
corporation isn’t the answer. The
Treasury is understandably incensed by
die proposal. It isn’t just another case
of Trade treading on Treasury grass,
ibis time Mr. McEwen is right on its
flower beds, rummaging about in its
glasshouses. One may well wonder why
trade is intruding in the matter at all.
Purely if there is more overseas capital
to be had by this route the Treasury
would have spotted it. But is there? If
n ot, Mr. McEwen’s latest brainchild
s hould be killed at birth.

MINING • SHARE • LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON in Sydney
OF COURSE THERE ought to be a
booming mining market; the more for-
tunes to be made in it the better. This
is the stuff that major developmental
dreams are made on and that pro-
vides a vehicle by which they can be
turned into reality. It is foolish for
investors to turn their backs on all this
speculative stuff as if it were immoral.
A buoyant mining market brings
greater interest in the very sort of
development we need. It increases the
chances of raising capital for all these
ventures and even if a lot of it will
eventually go down the drain, the suc-
cesses will be worth it.
Last week, the boom reached a re-
markable peak as Australia’s two
newly-installed top mining stocks, BHP
and Western Mining, led the way for
healthy rises in CRA, Norths, Souths,
Ampol Exploration, Woodside, the
Associated group, and all the other
participants (or near participants) in
the good mining news. And a highly
successful newcomer, beach sands
miner Cudgeon RZ, had an excellent
first day on the lists as holders almost
doubled their money. And this Thurs-
day there is Hamersley Iron coming
on (at a handsome premium) to add
another touch of excitement to the
market.
But w hile the mining market’s atten-
tion i s diverted into these channels,
t hi s could be an excellent time to have
a serious look at those mining stocks
the boom has passed by. And there is
n 0 doubt that there are some interest-
ing ones: stocks like Kathleen Invest-
ments, which is now 56 cents below its
best point for the year, or Consolidated
Goldfields, which is 30 cents down, or
Consolidated Rutile, which has drop-
ped 47 cents as plant problems hold up
production (they should be solved in
a few months), or Loloma, which is
20 cents below its best, or Mt. Morgan,
which is down 58 cents. And then
there is Oil Search, which has shed
six cents of the eight cents rise it had
earlier this year. For those wanting an
oil flyer, it seems that the next one on
the list could be the Exoil-Transoil
group rather than Oil Search. But this
is one for the chartists,
A mining portfolio with these half-
dozen stocks in it stands as good a
chance of doing really well over the
next year or so (with far fewer down-
side risks) as would one made up of
the market’s current favorites.
The most striking of these is Kath-
leen Investments, whose recent accounts
will be examined more thoroughly in
next week’s Bulletin, but which
clearly gives every indication of being
able to earn 100 percent profits within
four years and to be at least able to
maintain its present (although, for the
last two years, uncovered) 25 per-
cent dividend until then.
By 1970, Kathleen ought to have
iron ore and uranium earnings adding
substantially to its income from rutile
and zircon, ilmenite and tin with
prospects of a few more interesting
minerals as well. There seems little
doubt that Kathleen will cover its divi-
dend in the current year as steady pro-
fits from Rutile and Zircon Mines, and
sharply increased returns from ilmenite
producer Cable (1956) Ltd., which con-
tributed $199,303 to the group last
year, and tin miner Pilbara Tin which
lost $2,722, should considerably boost
last year’s net profit of $558,000 (which
fell short of the dividend charge by
$67,000).'
There are real prospects that the
market’s interest in uranium, that
pushed this stock up earlier this year,
will reappear soon when the Govern-
ment (as it must) changes its ridiculous
new ruling on uranium exports and
when it becomes clear that there are
real prospects of uranium contracts for
this group emerging within the next
three years.
Loloma’s appeal is not only for what
it has stopped doing (its dreadful tin
venture in Queensland has now merci-
fully ended), but also for what other
people are doing on its behalf. For its
investment protfolio is giving Loloma a
very high status indeed among those
investors who are aware of its impli-
cations. In addition to such conven-
tional but highly successful investments
as 60,000 BHPs and 50,000 CRAs it
also has 100,000 King Island Scheelites
and 825,000 Great Boulders (a stock
whose much improved present market
status has more to do with nickel than
the nevertheless interesting develop-
ments announced at the weekend in
which it is merging its gold operations
with Lake View and Star). At last
balance date, Loloma’s assets had a
The Chartist says:
PENFOLDS WINES appears to be ripening for further substantial gains by
investors. The overall performance since listing in 1962 has been above the average
industrial, and holders of this stock would not be showing any erosion of capital
at the present time. There have been some wide price movements, and at times
this stock has fast intermediate trend rates. The price movements since the low
point of $1.50 in May, 1966, have confirmed a 30 percent uptrend; the recent rise
to $2.20 on high volume could be regarded as a breakout from the consolidation
pattern, which suggests a short-term target of approximately $2.35, with a further
medium-term move close to $2.60 and an even more optimistic target of $3.50 for
the long term. However, it is possible that a short-term reaction back to the trend

book value of $1.58 a share and this
would have soared in the latest mining
boom, yet the latest price of Loloma is
only about $1.40.
To some extent, Mt. Morgan’s price
fall to $3 may be due not only to pros-
pects of an easier copper price but also
to a recognition that its chances of get-
ting a fertiliser plant at Gladstone to
use Morgan pyrites are none too bright
following the big fertiliser developments
now progressing at Brisbane. But cur-
rent prices seem very reasonable indeed
for this stock.
If Hamersley is going to be worth
something like eight times its original
capitalisation when it hits the market
this week it could be that Consolidated
Goldfields deserves even higher status
than the $4.12 it has eventually settled
down to after earlier flurries up to
$4.40.
Of course there are others like Mt.
Isa that have struck problems, which
could explain their fall from grace.
Isa’s difficulties could last for quite a
while yet as the company has to work
through the poor sections of the mine
near the foot of the new K 57 shaft be-
fore it can get back to its usual higher
grades of ore. So while recovery could
be a fair way off, when it comes it will
be substantial. The shares seem to have
little downside risk at prices around
$3.58, even though recovery to prices
over $4 may take some time.
THE “BIG DRY” in the Riverina
and Victoria has knocked all of this
year’s recovery out of the pastoral
stocks just as they were looking on top
of the world following last year’s end
of the big drought. Last week there
were some useful rains over parts of
the large area affected in this year’s
dry (in different parts of the country
from 1966’5) but a lot more is needed
to get farmers out of trouble. Never-
theless, the market may well have over-
done its disappointment with the pas-
toral stocks by marking them down so
severely in recent months.
All of them are around their lowest
points for the year, as the pastorals
section of the Sydney share price index
has fallen 8 percent this year to the
same level as it was in January last
year when the drought was almost at
its worst. The current situation is not
anywhere near that degree of disaster.
All this means that there are bargains
in the pastorals. Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mcrt is now' selling at about
$2.22, compared with its year’s high of
$2.71 some months ago, and yields 4.5
percent from a ten percent dividend
that is covered 2.2 times; Pitt Son has
fallen from $2.55 to $2.16 to yield 5.1
percent on a 1.3 times covered 11 per-
cent dividend; Younghusband is down
from 90c to 72c, giving a 6.9 percent
yield from a ten percent dividend that
was only 1.3 times covered last year,
and Winchcombe Carson has dropped
from $1 to only 81c to yield 7.4 percent
on the uneasy-looking six percent divi-
dend that was not covered by last year’s
earnings.
But no matter how cheap these stocks
may look, the Chartist says there is
no need to rush into them (even, -though
there seems every chance of making
money in the long run in fundamental
terms). The pastoral stocks were re-
viewed in The Bulletin on September
3, 1966, and the Chartist says: “It has
become apparent over the past few
weeks that this group is deteriorating
technically, as they have broken up-
trends held for over twelve months.
There seems very little chance of
immediate capital appreciation, and
therefore these stocks should be
avoided at paiesent. Included in this
group would be Elder Smith Golds-
brough Mort, Winchcombe Carson, and
Younghusband. However, it is quite
likely that the low points of 1965-66
will provide fairly strong suppoit
levels.”

A long way to go
Kauri result below board hopes
By PELIAS in Melbourne
KAURI TIMBER still has a long way
t 0 go; the latest half-year profit of
$50,947 is certainly far better than the
loss of $83,684 in the same half of
last year, but it only represents a mod-
est improvement on the $33,000 profit
recorded in the second half of 1965-
66. And it is bad luck for Kauri that,
in this delicate stage of its revival, the
level of business activity should be so
bad in South Australia. The seven per-
cent sales dip in the six months of
February was mainly due to depressed
marketing conditions in that State.
The market had expected a fairly
good report, having lifted Kauri’s share
price from 17 to 24 cents over the past
three weeks with steady buying com-
ing from the significant source of lan
Potter and Co., whose associated mer-
chant banker, Australian United Corp-
oration, is a large shareholder in Kauri.
The latest profit has certainly fallen
far short of directors’ hopes. But the
chairman, Mr. W. Kirkhope, said at
last year’s annual meeting that share-
holders would be very satisfied if pro-
fits for the current year reached half
the target set by directors. And on top
of that, the home-building business
seems to have picked up a fair bit in
recent months.
It will take a much bigger profit
before the company can begin to think
about dividends; just to pay the pref-
erence dividend (omitted again this
time) would cost $70,000 a year and
a modest 5 percent ordinary dividend
would require an additional $125,000.
It looks as if it could take a couple of
years before profits over the $200,000
or so mark (barely covering such a
dividend commitment) could be ex-
pected.
The most important thing about
Kauri, however, is that so much of last
year’s loss was due to non-recurring ex-
penses or to costs that have been elim-
inated from future accounts. Without
these non-recurring expenses, last
year’s loss would have been a profit;
they stemmed mainly from bringing
retiring allowances and superannuation
payments up to date.
Overriding all these considerations is
the reduction to the annual interest bill
which the- group must have achieved
this year. Late in 1965-66 certain
arrangements were made which reduced
the bill by $50,000 annually, as from
the beginning of the current year. A
<1>150,000 loan carrying an unknown but
reputedly high rate of interest was paid
off also. Since balance date, several
interests have been sold in return for
liquid funds. Although certain of these
funds will have gone straight into the
business, a percentage may also have
gone to paying off debts and reducing
the interest bill further.
Over the current year, it is feasible
that a full 12 months cf the interest
savings it should have achieved
recently would amount to well over
$lOO,OOO. Added to this is the better
trading which should have been experi-
enced so far in the current half and
the initial benefits which should be
starting to flow from the personnel
and organisational changes of recent
times, especially in Tasmania. “Should”
is the operative word, as no one can
be quite sure of what is in store for
shareholders yet.
MELBOURNE CLOTHING com-
pany John Sackville should provide
some sort of capital growth later this
year if the shares are bought for their
current 66 cents. This seems a rather
low price for a company with a basically
successful record and good growth pros-
pects. True, the company is in textiles,
not a field which inspires investors to
take prices to any great heights, but
this does not seem to warrant a dividend
yield as high as 9| percent from the 12|
percent annual dividend (well covered
by 18.9 percent earnings). The cover
will undoubtedly be extended this year.
Although things continued on a steady
plane in the first six months, there has
been considerable improvement in the
current half. The group has a licence
to use the American Koratron process
and a considerable volume of its gar-
ments are now coming out under this
banner.
A year ago the shares were fetching
between 80 and 90 cents. Once earning
rate starts to climb back to the 27.5
percent level of 1964-65, there seems
every prospect that the shares should
resume their former levels, too.
THERE COULD be implications for
the Federal Hotel group in the $5.6
million purchase by Castlemaine Per-
kins of a large part of the Whitehouse
family’s Queensland hotel interests.
Although the funds appear to be ear-
marked for completing the Chevrons
$5 million “stage 2” (a 35-storey block
to go alongside), there will probably
be some left over to provide cash for
other acquisitions that could provide
the Whitehouse family with leading
hotels (rather than old-style pubs)
in Australia’s major cities.
With the brewery battle in Queens-
land between Castlemaine, and Carlton
and United meaning that beer-selling
pubs are at a premium (the breweries
are buying them for their value at out-
lets rather than on their own com-
mercial merits), and while the demand
for quality hotel rooms continues to
soar in the major cities, the timing of
the Whitehouse switch from pubs to
hotels is excellent. Presumably it will

not rest with this deal.
There is now some speculation about
whether the Whitehouse deal bears any
relation to the “quite significant” move
due to be anounced soon by Mr. R. R.
Markillie, the Federal’s biggest share-
holder.
The shares were fetching only 17
cents at the beginning of this month,
when a determined buyer moved into
the market and gradually lifted the
price to 27 cents last week, before they
fell back to 21 cents by Friday. Also,
there have been reports that several of
the company’s large shareholders have
been approached to sell a proportion
of their holdings. Something is obvi-
ously going on, and as long as the
shares remain such a long way below
par it is probably worth gambling on
the outcome of Mr. Markillie’s
announcement.
Anyone not prepared to take a
gamble should keep well away.
Behind the balance sheets
Cemac well-settled
for success
A BONUS ISSUE two years ago, a
dividend rise this year along with a
“marked increase in profit” things
look very good indeed for that section
of the pre-fabricated plywood and par-
titions business in which the smallish
Sydney-based contractor Cemac Associ-
ated Ltd. operates.
Cemac’s successes, in a business where
so many other companies have come
to grief, seem likely to continue, despite
the clear dangers that exist in this in-
dustry. For it is not overcapitalised,
does not concentrate too heavily in vul-
nerable activities, and is not simply an-
other plywood company; in profit terms,
it is a plywood user more than a ply-
wood maker. True, in some sections of
its activities there is mounting and
serious competition (such as the com-
ing of foreign timber companies like
Weyerhaeuser on to the local scene), but
in its major area of partition contract-
ing Cemac’s position looks fairly strong.
It is also significant that Cemac has
been able to do well even though the
building industry has been going
through difficult times. And now that
building statistics are showing consider-
able improvements, Cemac’s scope for
much higher levels of activity has
accordingly risen sharply. For Cemac’s
main field of operations is in commer-
cial and industrial buildings, where it
supplies modular prefabricated com-
ponents, and if things are looking
bright enough for houses and flats,
where building approvals are up 11
percent, they are far better for other
new buildings (Cemac’s main custo-
mers), whose approvals are up 31 per-
cent in the March, 1967, quarter, com-
pared with the similar period for 1966.
The level of activity in “Other new
building approvals” has made almost
a complete recovery to the level of
the March, 1965, quarter.
This sudden jump in activity in the
current financial year may explain the
company’s out-of-proportion rises in
debtors (up 22 percent) and creditors
(up 28 percent) in last year’s balance
sheet, when the trend presumably may
have been evident in the closing months,
even though turnover for the full
1965-66 year had risen by only 4 per-
cent. It could be, however, that debtors
were slower to pay. Relating debtors to
sales gives an average term of ten
weeks in 1966, compared with nine
weeks in 1965. The provision for doubt-
ful debtors, after writing off all bad
debts, was percent of gross debtors
(4.9 percent in 1965).
In a year generally conceded difficult
for the building industry, when
Cemac’s sales rose by a modest 4 per-
cent to $10.1m., stocks were held in line
with only a 4 percent rise also, to sl.2rm

gjght times a year for the past two
years, that is, once every six weeks.
The company’s recent half-year report
announcing an interim dividend of 1\
percent instead of the usual 6J percent,
an d higher sales with a “marked
increase in profit,” suggests continua-
tion of a two-year trend of profit
increases in excess of turnover increases,
generally interpreted as a healthy sign
of higher efficiency. There is some
danger, of course, in that perhaps some
of the latest profit rise may include
significant amounts due under contracts
that have not been completed (particu-
larly in view of the strong rise in
debtors), but the company’s customers
seem largely to be other companies of
substance.
Absolute profits have shown a con-
tinuous upwards trend since going
public in 1956, with the exception of
a slight setback in 1959. Even earning
rates have improved each year since
1961, when the first one-for-five bonus
scaled down the earning rate. For most
years of its public life, dividend had
been more than twice covered, and in
the past two years a distinct lift in
earning rate gave a better cover than
this, even though 1965-66 capital was
inflated by the one-for-five bonus,
which ranked fully for dividends in that
year.
The new 15 percent dividend rate,
which follows the 12| percent paid for
10 years, does not seem to exclude
the prospect of further capital benefits
in the future. The 12.3 percent earn-
ings over the 5.1 percent dividend yield
offers promise of further capital
benefits, even though the company has
just stepped up income for share-

Cemac’s subsidiaries engaged in import-

With Placer’s expertise
THERE MUST BE many seasoned
investors who remember the times when
it was quite an everyday affair to buy
shares in overseas companies. Indeed
there are still quite a few companies
on local stock exchange lists which are
incorporated overseas and which op-
erate overseas. A lot of the Malayan
tin-mining companies are in this group,
and Emperor and Loloma both began
in Fiji (the latter no longer operating
there). But the advent of exchange
control regulations virtually put an end
to active trading in these overseas
stocks by making it impossible to remit
funds abroad for the purchase of shares
for portfolio purposes. The effect of this
has been to steadily reduce the Aus-
tralian content of the share registers of
these overseas companies. This has been
particularly noticeable in the case of
Placer Development Limited. At one
time Australians held almost half of
the company’s shares; five years ago this
holding had fallen to about thirty per-
cent and last year had reached just
over twenty percent. Over the past five
years, Placer’s shares have risen from
$lB to $33.
No doubt there has been pressure to
invest in mining companies based
locally, but until the iron ore dis-
coveries of recent times there have been
few local companies which could match
this Canadian company in the field of
the entrepreneurial ability exhibited by
prospecting mineral deposits with a
view to the subsequent floating of
operating companies in which a sizable
interest is retained.
Placer was originally formed by
two Australians, W. A. Freeman and
the Hon. C. A. Banks, CMG, in 1926.
Operations in Canada were not very
rewarding initially and the first sub-
stantial profits came from New Guinea,
where options were acquired in 1928
°ver gold leases in the Bulolo Valley.
Bulolo Gold Dredging Ltd. was formed
in 1930 and Placer retained about one-
third interest in the company. Bulolo
has provided Placer with handsome
dividends over the years, but in 1965
dredging operations ceased and there is
only about three years’ reserves of ore
left. Placer took over the remaining
shares in the company in 1965 and thus
now has full control over that com-
pany’s interest in the big plywood opera-
tion conducted jointly with the Com-
monwealth Government.
Closer to home, Placer had, since
1960, owned coalmining interests in
Australia, through Clutha Development
Ltd. and Wollclift Pty. Ltd., but sold
these (to the D. K. Ludwig group) in
1965. This sale exemplified the group’s
expertise. The companies involved had
cost some $5 million; after annual
profits around $1 million, they were
sold for approximately $ll million, to
show a capital profit of some $6 mil-
lion in a year when the prospects for
coalmining in Australia seemed to be
at an all-time high. This was the pat-
tern shown by Placer in 1962, when
pressure for a rise in the price of gold
appeared to be virtually insurmount-
able. It chose that time to sell its
interest in Pato Consolidated Gold
Dredging Ltd., which operated in South
America, to the South American Gold
and Platinum Company of New York.
The immaculate timing shown by
these sales is no less evident in the
company’s decisions to invest its funds
in the mining of particular metals. Six
years ago its investments did not include
any copper producers of substance, but
an investment made previously was soon
to bear fruit: Craigmont Mines Limited,
44.6 percent owned, began producing
ore in 1962, when the price of copper
was £stg.24o. Last year, when copper
rose to almost £stg.Boo, Craigmont pro-
duced 53,312 tons of copper concen-
trates and earned a profit of $C7.6
million. Copper prices have certainly
been falling, but the level of £stg.3oo
or more, which is considered to be a
stable price for both producers and
consumers, will still be well above
the prices which prevailed when the
interest in this mine was acquired.
Great acumen has been shown by
Placer with molybdenum. In 1964 it
held 22 percent of the capital of Endako
Mines Ltd. (NPL) and as development
proceeded it was issued additional
shares as consideration for providing-
finance. Placer’s interest in this company
is now 82.26 percent. Endako produced
its first operating molybdenum ore in
August, 1965, and for the first quarter
of the current year its profit of
$C3,100,000 accounted for 48 cents
(Canadian) of Placer’s total profits of
58 cents per share.

A MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF COMPANIES
year enabled Placer to enjoy the most
profitable period in its whole history
Profit for the eight months (resulting
from a change in balance date f rom
April to December) to December, 1955
was $C6,200,000 (this compared with a
profit of $C5.9 million in the twelve
months to April, 1966, and $C2.9 mil.
lion five years ago). These profits are
purely from mining and investment'
they take no account of the capital
profits earned by Placer from the sale
of various investments from time to
time. Such items are considerable; they
accounted for SC4 million last year
(i.e., eight months) and SCI 3 million
three years before.
Nor are the activities mentioned so
far the end of the story. The group
has interests all over the world besides
its mining interests in Canada, which
include a lead-zinc operation and a
zinc-copper mine (25 percent owned),
In the U.S.A. a 48 percent interest is
held in a coalmine (operating in
Alaska) and the company has an open-
cut iron-ore mine in southern Cali-
fornia. In the Philippines development
is being carried on a deposit containing
100 million tons of low-grade copper
ore, while in northern Greece prospect-
ing is continuing on a copper-gold
property. A lead-zinc mine is operated
(25 percent owned) in Portugal, and in
Australia the company still has interests
in the form of Fox Engineering, a
manufacturer of mining equipment,
Molybond Laboratories (50 percent),
an industrial lubricant business, and
Idac, a plywood manufacturer. The
group retains other interests in New
Guinea besides mining; has a cattle
property in the Markham Valley and
is a timber producer, as well as holding
a 20 percent interest in the Karlander
Shipping Line.
Should Placer be able to approach its
past record of earnings growth, bonus
issues, and capital profits, its shares
would compare well with any of the
other locally listed mining giants. At
the current price of $33, yield is fairly
nominal at 2 percent, but this is not
surprising when matched with stocks
like CRA, yielding 1.2 percent, Renison,
yielding 1.9 percent, and Consolidated
Goldfields, yielding 2.4 percent. As a
result of the takeover of Bulolo Gold
Dredging, an Adelaide company, Guinea
Gold NL, which previously held shares
in Bulolo Gold, came to acquire 24,600
shares in Placer. These shares are virtu-
ally its sole asset, and it passes on to
its shareholders the dividends receiveo
from Placer. With a total of 500,000
shares on issue, Guinea Gold provides
a very cheap avenue for investing 111
Placer; for example, at the current price
of $33 for Placer, each Guinea Gold
share is worth $1.61. Guinea Gold shares
have been trading at around sld‘ :
recently.

What will they use
Ornamesh for next?
We thought designers had dis-
covered all the uses for Lysaght
Ornamesh. We’ve seen it used
in solar screens, room dividers,
car sun visors, TV grilles, safety
guards, furniture, air cleaners,
grasscatchers, ironing boards
and 1,000 other ways. But we’re
glad to say we were wrong. The
planners of the new toll section
of the Pacific Highway dis-
covered a most imaginative use
for Ornamesh—as anti-dazzle
screens. Why Ornamesh? Be-
cause only Ornamesh has the
combination of qualities needed.
It's steel-strong. Rigid. Light-
weight. Most important, its
angled strands cut out headlight
glare without eliminating visi-
bility. Chances are, there’s a
profitable use for Ornamesh in

Carlton and United: the
advent of Courage
THE BREWERY COMPANIES have
Ion? been regarded as one of the best
areas f° r equity investment. It is not
c [ ear whether investors thought that
t |jgy were investing in stability or
nowth, but they certainly did not
expect to see any decline in the value
0 f their investment.
Carlton & United Breweries Ltd.
«2” shares, which are the only ones
that are held to any extent by the
general public, were first listed in 1964
after the company’s articles had been
changed to give them voting rights,
although they had been traded on the
Unofficial List for many years before.
During that year the price ranged be-
tween $4.23 and $3.70 (in terms of
today’s shares of $1 each). Somehow
or other, the shares managed to
reach new price peaks in each of the
following two years, but the 1966 low
price was $2.95.
Currently the shares have improved
in price to $3.15, to show an immedi-
ate dividend yield of 4.1 percent and a
price/earnings ratio of 14.2. During
1967 the price has been as high as $3.3$
and as low as $3.08.
In view of the timing of the decline
in the price, it does seem that the
announcement of a competitive brewery
to be established by the U.K. Courage,
Barclay, Simmonds group, in associa-
tion with British Tobacco (Australia),
did not help the status of CUB “Z”
shares. It is also likely that the subse-
quent loss of Sir Reginald Fogarty, who
had guided the company’s affairs for so
many years, had some bearing on the
investors’ assessment of the value of the
shares.
Early this year, shortly after the half-
yearly report had announced that sales
and profits were “slightly higher,” the
company made known that it would
issue $lO million of debentures “to im-
prove the liquidity of the group and
to provide for the continued growth
and development of the group’s activi-
ties.” Before discussing these recent de-
velopments, the record of the past five
years should be examined. The
statistics are:

■taking the debenture issue first, it
would certainly appear that the current
ratio at June 30, 1966, was rather on
the low side, even for CUB, and that
some improvement in liquidity was
desirable. It is apparent immediately
from a closer examination of the con-
solidated balance sheet that bank over-
draft and deposits at call had increased
from about $l.l million at June 30,
1965, to $7.8 million at June 30, 1966.
In the same 12 months, freehold and
leasehold brewery, hotel, and other
properties and equipment rose by $10.5
million, and machinery, plant, and
equipment by another $4.3 million.
While this substantial increase was met
to a small extent by an issue of “Z”
shares, raising just under $1 million,
and cash flow provided about $5.3 mil-
lion, some refunding certainly seemed
to be necessary. It is also possible that
the management had in mind that there
were contracts for capital expenditure
outstanding for about $3 million and
that within the next 18 months the
existing issue of five percent mortgage
debentures would fall due for repay-
ment.
It was suggested at the time of the
announcement that these new funds
were raised for the purpose of buying
additional hotels so as to meet the
potential threat of the new brewery. It
is possible that this was the purpose,
but, in my view, it is not really neces-
sary to look beyond the balance sheet
to see justification for the long-term
debenture issue of last February.
The threat from the new brewery
must be taken seriously because it is
understood that, once it becomes fully
operative, the Courage group is looking
for about ten percent of the local
market. Because of the many interests
of CUB, it is difficult to say whether
this loss of sales (if it occurs) would
have a serious effect on the consolidated
profit. If it happened, then it looks as
though the loss of such a percentage
would mean that it would take three
years, about, for revenue to recover to
the original level. This assumes that
there would be no increase in the price
of beer in Victoria during the period,
whereas, in recent years, the brewers’
price has been increased on more than
one occasion.
From a few recent Press features, it
would appear that Mr. Breheny, the
new general manager, is fully aware of
the problem that has to be faced.
Recently, it was stated that CUB would
be packing its beer in “glass cans” in
the future, as well as using the “tear-
off” opening can. Other reports suggest
that CUB has been making efforts to
improve its image with its customers
—hotelkeepers and licensed grocers
and others who market its products.
Although CUB’s monopoly in Victoria
has existed only for quite a short while,
it has been very well established there
for many years. Its last competitor in
Melbourne was acquired in 1962, but
in the previous financial year it had
acquired the Queensland Breweries.
This entry into the Queensland market
is rumored not to have been over-
successful. The only basis for such a
suggestion is that Castlemaine Perkins
has not suffered in any way and seems
to have become more profitable since
CUB’S arrival.
CUB also has interests in northern
Queensland, where its subsidiary, North
Australian Breweries, supplies Cairns
and Townsville. Another brewery is
operated at Darwin, where strong
competition is met from the Western
Australian brewer Swan Brewery.
Finally, it is a partner with W. R.
Carpenter in a brewery in Fiji. How-
ever, owning breweries is only part of
the problem in selling beer. It is neces-
sary to ensure that there are guaranteed
outlets, and it is understood that one
reason for Courage selecting Victoria
as the State in which to challenge the
“establishment” was that it had the
lowest proportion of “tied houses” of
any of the Australian States. There is
some evidence that CUB has been tak-
ing steps to remedy this situation.
During 1965/6 three large hotels situa-
ted in the Melbourne suburbs were
purchased and since the balance date
more have been acquired. Even so, it
is unlikely that CUB owns more than
10 percent of the total number of
hotels in Victoria, but it might be able
to influence the owners of many more
by the fact that it holds the mortgage
on the freehold. The eventual outcome
cannot even be guessed at.
It is probably fair to say that no
strong growth in earnings per share can
be expected in the immediate future
unless some of the new developments
in brewing techniques should prove to
be bonanzas in cost saving. It then
becomes a question whether the long-
term prospects for CUB are such that
fourteen times earnings is a reasonable
price for the “Z” shares of the com-
pany. This class of share has been used
to make the purchases of hotels, etc.,
and over the past five years nearly 3.6
million shares have been issued in this
way. This number represents over
fifteen percent of the total issued shares.
Growth in earnings per share has
been at the rate of 3 percent per annum
on average; it is significant that
the growth occurred from 1962/3 to
1563/4 in the main. No one could anti-
cipate greater growth in the future, but,
because of the solidity of CUB and the
fact that dividends per share are now
increasing, a 7 percent earnings yield
does not seem unreasonable.

No wonder he’s the family favourite. Clean warm
air circulating in every room throughout the
coldest periods of the year. No huddling around
ineffective one-room heaters!
No frigid early morning toes! Instead, the won-
derful feeling of being able to wear summertime
clothes throughout your home every day of the
year—and with simple, finger-tip control!
Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner —that’s what
Gilbarco Central “Whole House” Heating means
in the successful man’s home. You can get all
this for little more than the cost of heating
two or three rooms with “huddle-over” heating!
Two systems from which to choose: The popular
Hot Water Central Heating system incorporating
The Potterton Boiler unit, which supplies
throughout-the-home heat with a complete hot
water service: or a fully ducted warm air system
in which air is fan-circulated from a Gilbarco
Warm Air Furnace.
Both heating units are compact enough to place
in the garage, laundry, basement or even under
the house.
For full details, contact the Gilbarco office in
your city—who will advise you your nearest
Gilbarco Dealer—located in all cities and major
country towns.

MASTER-KEYED SYSTEMS
A Master-Keyed System is one in which each
lock has its own individual key, which oper-
ates that lock only and no other, but where
each lock is also built to a Master-Key which
will open all locks in the group.
Within a Master-Keyed System, if required,
certain locks may be grouped in a section
Keyed-Alike to a given Service-Key, and still
subject to the Master-Key.

GRAND MASTER-KEYED SYSTEM
Each lock has its own individual key which
operates that lock only and no other, but the
locks are divided into two or more groups.
Each group is subject to its own Master-Key,
which opens all locks in that group, but no
other group.
However, all locks are also subject to a
Grand Master-Key which opens all locks in
all groups.
As with Master-Keyed Systems, Keyed-Alike
groups may also be included in G.M.K. Systems.

THE LAND
Wheat and the Kennedy Round
By the RURAL EDITOR
WHAT HAS EMERGED from the
Kennedy Round, for wheat, is essen-
tially a continuation of the existing
International Wheat Agreement, except
that the Soviet Union is not a par-
ticipant in this one. Red China has
never been a participant in any wheat
agreement. The agreements have been
inexistence since 1949 and are more a
declaration of intent than a firm fixing
of prices. The stated aim is an element
of stability, not absolute stability.
The basis of the prescribed price
range is a minimum price for United
States hard winter wheat available for
shipment at Gulf ports. This price
allows shippers, importers, processors,
and traders around the world to plan
ahead with some semblance of order.
This is to the advantage of all partici-
More silos needed
pants in the agreement. The latest basic
minimum price is $U.5.1.73 a bushel,
which is about $A1.55. There is a vast
range of wheat varieties which sell
above and below this price. Usually
Australian FAQ sells at between five
and ten cents a bushel under U.S. hard
winter.
An intriguing aspect of the latest
Geneva agreement is that the base
wheat appears to have been changed
from Canadian No. 1 Northern Mani-
toba to U.S. hard winter. Since 1949,
Canadian No. 1 Northern Manitoba
has always been the selected wheat.
Taking into account the difference in
these two wheats, it may be that any
gains for Australia could be something
less than the 20 cents a bushel which
has been mentioned.
With six months left in the 1966-67
season, the size of the carryover is the
crucial matter for the Australian wheat-
grower and taxpayer. The harvest, an
all-time record, was in excess of 450
ruillion bushels. So far this season
there has been only one really big sale
156 million bushels (1J million tons)
to Communist China back in November
last year. What we need badly is
another big sale to China.
Since the China trade began on a
large scale, there have always been two
big sales per season —one at the begin-
ning of and one following the harvest.
The November, 1964, sale of 1J mil-
lion tons was followed by the April,
1965, sale of 1J million tons; November,
1965, 500,000 tons; June, 1966, 600,000
tons (drought year); November, 1966,
1,500,000 tons, June, 1967?
Farmers in all States are calling for
bigger wheat-storage facilities. Unfor-
tunately they take the view that these
storages should be supplied by the Gov-
ernment: For the first time since the
wheat stabilisation system was intro-
duced, in the 19405, farmers are divided
over the question of planting. Always,
in the past, the farmers were in agree-
ment that all the wheat that could be
grown should be grown. But now
farmers in the older, traditional wheat-
growing areas such as the Wimmera
and Mallee are expressing the view that
farmers in northern N.S.W. and
Queensland are planning too much
wheat. With typical farmer logic they
are blaming the lack of a wool stabilisa-
tion scheme for this undoubted rush to
get wheat in the ground.
If Australia were industrially power-
ful enough to erect vast wheat silos
without imposing more heavily on urban
taxpayers who are already subsidising
growers - the size of the carryover
would be no problem. It could even be
an insurance. For example, the weather
just now does not look good in many
wheat-growing areas. Next season’s har-
vest could be a poor one. But erection
of these storages would fall heavily on
the community at large, and there are
other, perhaps more vital, uses for
public money, including defence and
education. The wheat farmers, through
their organisations, are pressing for an
extension of the guaranteed price to
200 million bushels, or an increase in
the guaranteed price, or both. Next
year, 1968, the wheat stabilisation legis-
lation comes up for review and, in order
to bolster the wheat farmers’ case,
another argument is being advanced.
This is that the system of assessing the
cost of production favors the big farmer
at the expense of the small man.
Economists, who are not liked much
by farmers, have pointed out many

The Minister for Trade, Mr.
McEwen, is happy with the result of
the Geneva talks. He says the wheat
agreement should mean an improve-
ment in the profitability of wheat grow-
ing and should give the Treasury relief
from the cost of obligations under the
Wheat Stabilisation Act. It is to be
hoped that this is so.

by a Commonwealth Government
announcement. Treasury approval has
been given to an American consortium,
Dow Chemical-Swift and Co., to raise
money in Australia to build a huge
nitrogen fertiliser factory near Brisbane.
Local dollars will contribute about one-
third of the total outlay, which will be
around $4O million. The Government’s
OK came only after protracted negotia-
tions with the company.
The plant will be using natural gas
from the Roma fields. It is scaled to
produce a thumping 650 tons of
ammonia a day. This capacity will
roughly quadruple Australia’s present
total output of ammonia. Dow expects
to have the factory gates open within
18 months.
Now the interesting question is: who
is going to use all this nitrogen and for
what? Last August our Federal
Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, declared a
bounty of $BO per ton of nitrogen occur-
ring in nitrogenous fertilisers. In prac-
tical language this means that the price
of, say, sulphate of ammonia is reduced
by about $l7 a ton, of urea by about
$37 a ton. Mr. McMahon is not even
a keen home-gardener, so far as is
known. Someone must have put this
nitrogen notion into his head. If the
farmers and graziers’ organisations
were behind it, they have given no
hint of their machinations neither before
nor since. The bounty certainly came
as a big surprise to most professional
agrostologists, whose knowledge of how,
when, and where to use artificial nitro-
gen in Australian agriculture is sketchy.
Therefore, it does not seem likely that
he acted on scientific advice.
Neither of these groups, of course, is
now inclined to look a gift-horse in the
mouth. Yet they must, because probably
no country with a modern agriculture
knows less about the use of bag nitrogen
than Australia. Its price has always
precluded its use here, except on sonii
horticultural crops and sugar, the pro'
duction of which is already subsidised
The bounty is quite a generous on f
and would seem to alter radically tht
traditional economics of nitrogen fe r .
tilisation in this country’s agriculture
Thousands of farmers who have nevei
used nitrogen before could easily be
tempted by the new low prices and
rush into trying it. If, however, they
first turn to the agricultural scientists
for advice they will, as often as not be
met with fairly vague and sometimes
conflicting answers, particularly h
eastern Australia.
For cereal crops this calculation i s
relatively straightforward. The Depart-
ment in W.A. is confident that added
nitrogen is usually profitable, but con-
ditions in the other States make
generalisations hazardous. On some pad-
docks in some seasons in Victoria and
New South Wales a nitrogen dressing
on wheat would show- a profit. Calcu-
lating the returns from nitrogen applica-
tion to pastures (Mr. McMahon sug-
gested this usage) is a vastly more
complicated problem which our scien-
tists have scarcely begun to grapple
with yet.
In his Budget speech Mr. McMahon
reckoned that the bounty would cost
the taxpayer $5,600,000 in its first full
year of operation. This may be so, but
one can see the bill getting a lot heftier
fast. At the moment Australian agricul-
ture applied about 101 b. of phosphorus
A bountiful Treasurer
to every lib. of nitrogen and 21b. of
potassium. The world picture contrasts
sharply: global use of fertiliser is in the
ratio of slightly less than Jib. phos-
phorus to every lib. nitrogen and fib.
potassium. (Since we are now subsi-
dising phosphatic and nitrogenous fer-
tilisers it seems unfair to discriminate
against the potash people.)
Farmers in Europe pay as little as
6 cents a lb. for nitrogen, and in the
U.S.A. the price is about 8 cents. Until
fairly recently the Australian price was
12 cents or higher. Even before last
August, however, the price was falling
and some forms of the fertiliser were
providing nitrogen for as little as 9
cents. Then came the bounty, which
knocks off about another 4 cents a lb.
Cost-wise, the stage seems set for
soaring consumption of nitrogenous fer-
tiliser in this country. And some people
are going to make a packet out of it
with taxpayers’ help.

BOOKS
Girl in a glass-bottomed boat
By JOHN BAXTER
A Girl Like I. Anita Loos. Hamish
Hamilton. $3.85.
TO HAVE BEEN a scriptwriter for
D. W. Griffith at 15 is certainly the
basis for some claim to fame, but when
one has also appeared in the first
American performance of Ibsen’s “A
Doll’s House” and almost been raped
by Augustus John, as well as being told
by New York wit and critic Alexander
Woollcott that he had wanted all his
life to be a mother, there is evidence to
suggest that one deserves a more exalted
state than mere notoriety. Already
firmly entrenched in history as the
prototype flapper, Anita Loos with this
caustic autobiography moves a step
higher to become a prime contender
for the title of the most emancipated
woman of the ’twenties.
A girl like Miss Loos could not, with
her bizarre background, have been ex-
pected to be anything less than an
individual. Raised in the shadow of a
grandmother named Cleopatra Fair-
brother, who took the first, grand piano
to California by shipping it around
Cape Horn (accompanied by its own
private tuner, who so far forgot himself
as to perish of seasickness on the
voyage), she was also burdened by a
profligate father who rejoiced in the
name of R. Beers Loos, not to mention
a variety of criminal, amoral but
extremely stimulating relatives. A free-
wheeling aunt sent her old Paquin and
Mainbocher gowns from Paris, and, for
social life, one could always chat with
such friends of Loos pere as Harry
Houdini.
The young Anita’s first literary sale
came at the age of eight, when she won
a $5 prize in a slogan competition for
floor wax. Her father immediately
annexed the money, an action which
prompts Miss Loos to soliloquise at
length on the thrill she has always felt
at giving money to men. “In fact,” she
remarks, in the first of many candid, if
debatable, observations on male/female
relationships scattered through the
book, “the reason mother-love itself is
so exhilarating is that it provides so
many opportunities for self-sacrifice.”
Consistently clear-headed about sex as
she is throughout “A Girl Like I,” one
wonders why both Miss Loos’ marriages
failed. On the evidence, one is forced
to the conclusion that neither of her
husbands was capable of handling the
Loos wit and galloping egomania.
By the 1900 s—she is infuriatingly
vague about specific dates—Anita was
regularly selling magazine items, and
in 1911 she sold her first movie
scenario. None of the purchasers was
aware that the author of these tough
little comedies was a diminutive teen-
ager who found it almost impossible to
convince people that she was over
twelve years old. When D. W. Griffith,
who filmed her first script, “The New
York Hat,” in 1912 and was later to
give her the job of writing the titles for
his greatest film, “Intolerance,” called
her to Hollywood for a conference,
both he and his associates assumed that
the writer of the scripts was Anita’s
mother. Humiliated, Anita fled from the
studio, but was, if we may believe these
memoirs, coaxed back by Griffith, who
pursued her up the street, begging her
to return and write for him.
The picture drawn later of Griffith
as lofty, magisterial, a figure of fear to
his actors, does not seem to square with
this early image, but so much of “A
Girl Like I” consists of laudatory
letters, second-hand compliments and
testimonials that to disbelieve this, the
first of them, is to cast grave doubt on
the entire fabric of her memoirs. The
men who, with doglike devotion, were
later to throw themselves at the feet of
the contemptuous Anita include the
poet Vachel Lindsay, playwright Sher-
wood Anderson, critic George Jean
Nathan, Joe Schenck, whose financial
acumen controlled the Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer empire, and New York wit H. L.
Mencken, the “stealing” of whom by a
blonde chorus girl inspired Miss Loos
to write her savagely satirical novel
“Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.” It is a
rich collection of intellectuals and mil-
lionaires she has gathered to her in this,
her old age, and if we can legitimately
doubt the degree of their devotion she
is at least to be complimented for
exaggerating about only the best people.
After having written a number of
Griffith films, Anita and her then hus-
band, director John Emerson, began
work on a series of productions for
Douglas Fairbanks. “My chief require-
ment in writing scripts for all those
first Fairbanks movies,” she says, “was
to find a variety of spots from which
Doug could jump.” Associates at that
time included Erich von Stroheim,
Mabel Normand, the Talmadge sisters
and Natalie’s husband, the weary, alco-
holic Buster Keaton, drug addict Wal-
lace Reid, and Virginia Rappe, soon to
die in the Fatty Arbuckle scandal.
Her picture of Hollywood in the
Anita Loos
’twenties is ill-documented but fas
cinating. “Living in Hollywood,” she
quotes Wilson Mizner as saying, “is like
floating down a sewer in a glass-
bottomed boat.” Her reminiscences ol
promiscuity, divorce, and bankruptcy
bear this estimate out, but like most of
the people working there before the
coming of sound she seemed to enjoy
the life, perhaps because she was no
stranger to these things herself. One ol
the most revealing of her memoirs is
that surrounding her first marriage, is
which she trapped a “straw husband' 1
to provide an excuse for her leaving
home and moving to Hollywood.
The resulting marriage lasted only as
long as it took Anita to flee from a
disastrous wedding night, but her atti-
tude to men from this point becomes
progressively more disenchanted. Her
anecdotes mainly serve to dramatise the
ludicrous nature of sex, the humiliation
that it brings to the party who is sc
unwise as to commit himself emotion-
ally. A visit to Paris provides an oppor-
tunity to scorn Hemingway, Fitzgerald
and the rest of the American writers
colony there, and remark caustically
that, of them all, Gertrude Stein
seemed the most manly. Alice B. Toklas
is characterised, as we might expect
with familiar Loos acid.
The European tour also encourages
the revelation of a new story about the
suicide of Crown Prince Rudolf of
Austria and his mistress, Marie Vetsera,
a famous scandal of the time. Vetsera,
she suggests, first castrated the prince,
whereupon he shot her, then himself
The anecdote, with its implicit contempi
for the melancholy romance of the
approved version, in which the lovers
arrange a suicide pact so that they car
always be together, is typical of those
recounted throughout the book.

Confessions of
Svevo
By R. G. HOWARD
Short Sentimental Journey, Italo Svevo.
Seeker and Warburg. $4.45.
MOST OF THE eight stories collected
in this volume were written in the last
few years of Svevo’s life in a burst of
creative activity stimulated by the suc-
cess of “Confessions of Zeno.” Five are
unrevised or unfinished. The title story,
in fact, breaks off in mid-word—one
has a mental picture of Svevo dropping
off to sleep over the manuscript or
flinging down his pen in frustration.
Whatever the reason for the interrup-
tion of this and other projects, writing
was not apparently easy for him in those
final years.
This is surprising. The structure of
“Zeno” is so perfectly matched to
Svevo’s vision, the style is so effortless,
one would have thought he had devel-
oped an enviable facility of expression.
There are the occasional moments in
these later tales when the special bril-
liance of “Zeno” is recaptured, as when,
for instance, Mario, the victim of “The
Hoax,” gives his persecutor an awkward
but highly successful thrashing, but for
the most part they are more formal,
less witty, written, seemingly, in a
reversion to the style of “As a Man
Grows Older.” A closer reading sug-
gests, however, that, not content to con-
tinue in the vein of “Zeno,” Svevo was
still experimenting.
“The Hoax,” which was completed
and published in his lifetime, has a
characteristic plot. An old man who has
written in his youth a single novel
which he reads every night to his invalid
brother, is deceived into thinking that
an important publisher wants to buy it.
He is even presented with a false
cheque. The hoax turns to his advan-
tage when through some bizarre
anomaly of post-war Triestine econo-
mics, Mario makes a large sum of
money on this cheque. Finally, in
equally accidental fashion, he triumphs
physically as well as financially.
Though the passages describing
Mario’s relationship with brother, and
the final scenes, are in the best Svevian
manner, wise and funny, penetrating yet
tender, much of the rest of the story
ls quite dull. Almost the whole of “The
Story of the Nice Old Man and the
Pretty Girl,” another fairly ambitious
work, is dull, too.
More interesting is “Short Senti-
mental Journey,” particularly in its
descriptions of Venice Svevo had
never previously given so much im-
portance to a locale. It brings face to
face two characters representing Svevo
at opposite ends of his life: a young
man in despair (like Alfonso in “A
Life”) at his irrationality, and a
slightly dotty old man ironically
resigned to his (like Zeno). This might
have been an important novel, had it
been finished.
The most interesting story by far in
this book is one called “Death.” Appro-
priately enough it was the very last
piece he worked on. An old man tells
his wife that he has spent his life pre-
paring for death, not only for his own
sake but because “it was up to him
to serve as an example to her.” She is
devoutly religious, while he has re-
mained an atheist, but, he tells her,
“examples of courage and resignation
are necessary even for a religious per-
son.” “Nothing,” he adds “is more
pitiful or grotesque than the squirming
of an animal when the butcher’s blade
sinks into it.”
Despite his preparation, poor Roberto
dies miserably, in terror and with a
sense of terrible guilt a final crush-
ing instance of irrationality. Up to a
point the story is clearly autobio-
graphical. Before he completed this tale
about the unfortunate Roberto, the
great ordeal came to Svevo himself.
Happy to say he met it with all the
courage and resignation his hero
lacked.
Svevo always wrote extremely well
about death. Each of his three novels
contains a detailed moving account of
a death, and this little story makes a
fitting culmination to the series. It
seems to me the finest piece in this
volume, despite its being unfinished.
The narrative strikes a note of quiet
tragedy that is quite unforgettable.
Svevo’s career is an intriguing one.
After writing two novels he put aside
his pen for twenty years. At the end of
this latent period he suddenly produced
a masterpiece,, “Confessions of Zeno.”
Was it that by a kind of chrysalid stage
he bystepped the slow evolution of
most writers and created “the one
novel” each novelist has within him
after a single metamorphosis? If this is
so, then we could have expected no
further major developments in his
writing—he would have either pro-
longed his great novel (as he did in
fact —fragments of a sequel to “Zeno”
will be published in the fifth and final
volume of his works) or else create a
series of minor variations.
However, I think the contents of this
volume belie such a view. “Short Senti-
mental Journey” and “Death” hint at
the possibility of new and important
directions in his work of an even greater
book. If on the whole the stories are
slightly disappointing, the volume is
well worth reading on this account.
Proportions
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Necklace. Charles Tomlinson.
Oxford. $2.15.
Pig Island Letters. James K. Baxter.
Oxford. $3.05.
Selected Poems. John Heath-Stubbs.
Oxford. $5.10.
CHARLES TOMLINSON’S “T h e
Necklace” must be one of the shortest
slim volumes ever published: sixteen
pages containing fifteen poems of a dry
calligraphic fastidiousness, introduced
by a characteristically generous essay
by Donald Davie. Reprinted after
eleven years to coincide with his most
recent book, “American Scenes and
other Poems,” “The Necklace” shows
that Tomlinson was from the beginning
the most consistently aesthetic of all
the present-day English poets and the
one who has learned most from the
Symbolists and the modern American
schools. Wallace Stevens is his master,
with Ezra Pound as assistant—though
a Stevens without the rapt sonorous
surge. Music in Stevens becomes etching
in Tomlinson, and his approach is best
summed up by his own art of poetry:
The fact being, that when the truth
is not good enough
We exaggerate. Proportions
Matter. It is difficult to get them
right.
There must be nothing
Superfluous, nothing which is not
elegant
And nothing which is if it is merely
that.
This fastidious precision develops into
the impressive arabesques of Tomlin-
son’s later work, whose main pre-
occupations are already present in these
lines. “The Necklace” will strike many
readers as extremely rarefied, but, after
the emotional fattiness and turgid senti-
mentality of many recent books, its
stringent verbal accuracy is especially
welcome.
James K. Baxter is probably the
most distinguished of present-day New
Zealand poets, and his poems are
marked by an extraordinary muscular
vigor. His accuracy lies not so much in
the delineation of objects as in the
forceful articulation of emotional ten-
sions and states, whether he is remem-
bering moments from his past as a
young rebel or writing of present
experiences on a wild coastline with
his family. His poems have an im-
pressive scope and individuality, but the
shadow of Robert Lowell falls heavily

On the other hand, “Near Kapiti” is
a splendid poem with all its Lowell
lessons learned and turned into what I
take to be echt Baxter. Poems like this
make “Pig Island Letters” a remarkable
book.
One of the most recent poems in
John Heath-Stubbs’ Selected Poems is
the “Poet of Bray,” a ballad about a
poet who starts writing political verse
in the ’thirties, turns Apocalyptic in the
’forties, running with the White Horse-
men down The New Road; then he
joins the Movement and becomes Leavi-
site, only to degenerate into a Beat and
start reading his verse to jazz on the
telly. It is a witty piece, and while it
contains the clue line “Even John Wax
might wane” it would not be absurdly
unfair to apply some of the poem to
Mr. Heath-Stubbs himself. All the Eng-
lish poetic fashions from the very late
’thirties on are reflected in his book,
from the Romanticism of “The Divided
Ways” to the pleasant and funny dry-
ness of “Epitaph.” But if Mr. Heath-
Stubbs has been fully aware of the
fashions of his time he has not merely
been led by them. He has converted
them to his own ends, and in his best
poems there is a sense of real
individuality.
Day Tripper
By JAMES KIRKUP
All the Time in the World. Hugo Wil-
liams. Alan Ross. $4.60.
MR. WILLIAMS is a poet, but one
would hardly guess it from this slight
but often likable book about the wander-
ings of a young Englishman through the
Middle East, India, Malaysia, Thailand
Cambodia, Japan, Australia, and Poly-
nesia. I have lived in all the places he
mentions, excepting the South Seas and
Australia; his account of the last-named
is in many ways the best part of the
book fast-moving, frank, wildly
impressionistic.
The final brief chapters on the Nev
Hebrides, Tahiti, and the sea-voyag(
back to England via Panama are in
evitably scrappy: the author seems to
have got fed up with taking propet
notes, which a true travel writer must


do every day. He bored me with his
references to uninteresting shipboard
acquaintances. One never meets “in-
teresting” people on one’s travels. But
it is a temptation for the lonely writer-
wanderer to inflate casual meetings and
nondescript people into something more
attractive than they really are. I never
trust first impressions of people, only of
things and places. Hugo Williams is
engagingly youthful in his belief that
one should find a “character” in every-
one one meets. The human flotsam and
jetsam clutter his book from beginning
to end.
Two people who are more than just
“characters” are described: D. J. Enright
in Singapore and Satyajit Ray in Cal-
cutta. It is significant that Williams’
account of these two fascinating human
beings leaves little impression on us:
some of the externals are there but the
real men are missing. They have given
him the slip because he was exploring
his own personality rather than theirs.
I am all in favor of a writer explor-
ing, and publicly exhibiting, his own
personality, provided he does it honestly.
Williams is honest, but what he shows
us of himself is not really interesting,
at least not interesting enough to sup-
port a whole book. It is partly, I sup-
pose, the fault of his youth—he keeps
telling us nervously that he is only 21.
The author spent two years on his
travels, but the overall impression they
leave is one of superficiality. All the
time he seems to be arriving some-
where, passing through, and moving on
somewhere else. The result is brittle
and inaccurate. This is a great pity,
because occasionally, when he gets away
from himself and the boring oddballs
and squares he chums up with, he
throws off a scintillating morsel of
description. He says somewhere that
when abroad he felt like a cripple. But
this was surely due almost entirely to
his wilful bad management of his
affairs. It is all very well to travel cheap
and impose upon the goodness of the
consular officials he so much despises—
but if one does so, one must expect
to waste much of one’s precious travel-
ling time sorting out difficulties.
Mr. Williams is constantly finding
himself without money, without clothes
and food, without visas, without tickets.
If the author had taken just a little more
trouble before he started he could have
spent more than one day at Angkor
Wat, a place that needs at least a week.
But Cambodia is, for the foreigner, the
most expensive country in Asia: it needs
money. There is no point in making a
long and arduous journey to stay there
only one day. So Mr. Williams’ chapter
on Angkor and Siem Reap is unbeliev-
ably weak.
Even worse are the chapters on
Japan, which seems to have aroused his
had temper from the start, always an
ominous sign. In any case, the best of
Japan was over when he got there: the
soul of Japan died during the new
Puritan era introduced by the prepara-
tions for the Tokyo Olympics. But there
1S no excuse for the countless mis-
spellings of quite well-known Japanese
words like tatami and of Japanese
proper nouns and personal names: this
should have been tidied up a bit. One
of the most senseless mistakes is in the
references to kendo, as Kendal.
Japan and the Japanese emerge from
this book in a lustreless, confused, and
inaccurate way. However, I was pleased
to find a reference to one of my
favorite jazz coffee-shops, Mama, in
Yurakucho. Here Mr. Williams seems
to have been blissfully unaware of the
strict conventions governing the shop:
the rather fanatical but nice proprietor
does not allow conversation, and tele-
phone calls are frowned upon, excepting
between records. The place is hardly
bigger than the top of a bus, and most
of the habitues (males only) sit alone,
silent, completely motionless, inhaling
Eric Dolphy or John Coltrane (the pro-
prietor will not permit the playing of
“vocals”).
Mr. Williams is utterly wrong when
he says Japan “prefers the ‘white’
fluency of West Coast jazz to the hard,
emotional playing of New York.” But
this is only one of a long list of errors
and misconceptions in what might have
been an outstanding travel book.
SHOWPIECE
This is a syllabic poem. You notice
how it advertises itself. The lines
with their indentations, and most of
them with lower-case beginnings.
But the ease of it is that
they end anywhere one
likes—even on an
indefinite
article.
Now if
one’s
short of
a new piece
to print somewhere,
one can cut it out
from one’s old prose. “All choice
of form is arbitrary.”
Criticism’s good enough cloth
—particularly if it contains
a mildly purple patch or two : “Donne looked
a good club with which to smash the Miltonic
temple.” Snip! “Mr. Eliot’s prestige grew
and grew: his pronouncements seemed godlike. I
recall a disciple shouting on
a page of Orion: ‘Milton
has been demolished!’ That must
have sounded hollow in
the shouter’s hearing
when the Master
took a long
look at
his
former
notion . . .” Snip!
snip! (You know what’s
coming—Eliot’s
famous “recantation.”)
You will have noticed, too, that
not only is this method of
making verses a mechanical
simple matter of counting and margins
but prose tailored like this goes so much farther.

Aboriginal Myths
Miss Marie Reay’s review (8., May 13)
of my collection “Aboriginal Myths
and Legends” provokes comment. As a
reviewer, Miss Reay has a right to her
reaction to the collection, as literary
critic and anthropologist she has the
obligation to be correct in the analysis
of her reaction.
It is obvious that Miss Reay shares
some anthropologists’ resentment at the
academically uninitiated intruding on
their sacred ground. Reviewing many
traditions in this book, A. D. Hope has
stated that “their real feeling of enter-
ing into the life of a sacred text has
been due to the fact that the transcriber
was a poet and not an anthropologist.”
Miss Reay is of the opinion that
other transcribers of traditions included
in the collection are more skilled than
myself. This may well be so, for the
authority on Aranda traditions, T. G.
H. Strehlow, has stated that the tradi-
tion given to me by Albert Namatjira,
included in this book, is “almost fault-
less.” All the traditions for which I,
as transcriber, am responsible have been
recorded exactly as my informants gave
them.
Your reviewer accuses me of “lingu-
istic naivete” when she discusses the
Ilingka tradition. She is actually ac-
cusing the authority, T. G. H. Strehlow,
who made the field tape-recording. I
did not have the pleasure of being
present on the occasion. The question
in the narrative to which Miss Reay
refers is Mr. Strehlow’s, not mine.
Miss Reay goes on to indict me on a
qualified definition of mythology as
being part of ritual, but she does not
quote my development of this view as
given by tribal narrators in the book.
It has been said that one should
accept criticism as one accepts the dew
or the rain. If, in turn, I criticise Miss
Reay, it is because I am also aware
that the dew or the rain falls on the
just and the unjust.

pondent Brian Buckley suggests that
the “non-news” technique to which he
refers is common practice among jour-
nalists this is not so, and in my
experience over more than 15 years
on three of the four Sydney news-
papers I have never known it to be
so. The value of Mr. Buckley’s crude
attack on the integrity of Sydney
journalists can well be measured by
the inaccuracies in his article. The
cornerstone of his report, which your
journal highlighted pictorially, appears
to be the reference to the suggested
stoppage of all Sydney buses on April
19. Mr. Buckley says: “Fortunately for
Sydney the buses did not stop.”
My own personal investigation into
the stories reveals that they were
founded on a statement issued on
April 18 by the Commissioner for
Government Transport, Mr. S. R.
Berry, which concludes: “the particular
troublespots tomorrow (Wednesday)
are likely to be Pagewood and Brook-
vale, but it is fairly clear that if the
dispute is not settled quickly it will
seriously affect all the Department’s
bus services in Sydney on Thursday.”
What, in fact, occurred was that by
early Thursday morning 90 buses were
off the road from Pagewood and 36
from Brookvale. Senior Government
Transport officials confirmed today
(May 8) that the buses would have
stopped if the strike by drivers of fuel
tankers had not ended when it did.
Let me make it very clear that I
am defending the good name and integ-
rity of AJA members, not the actions
of newspaper managements in their use
of sensationalism in their current cir-
culation war.

U.S. Rates
I would like to draw your attention
to some serious errors in your article
entitled “Our Way . . . And Theirs”
(8., April 1).
Your detail of Australian and
American rates of pay and allowances
indicates that an Australian colonel
draws $26.03 per day compared to his
American counterpart drawing $27.19
(Australian currency).
The Australian rates you quoted are
all too accurate alas! However,
U.S. colonels, in fact, draw $42.04 per
day, made up as follows:
Basic pay $31.11
Quarters allowance 5.30
Subsistence allowance 1.43
Separation allowance .. .. .. .90
Other hazardous duty pay . . 3.30
Total $42.04
Some explanation of these various
allowances may be necessary:
Basic pay. Varies by years of service,
and not by years in rank as is the case
in Australian Forces. The rate I quote
is for a newly promoted colonel wit}
18 years’ service.
Quarters allowance. Is paid to mar
ried and single personnel to maintair
living quarters when these are not pro
vided free on a military base. The rate
quoted is for a married officer.
Subsistence allowance. Is paid in
lieu of rations which are generally pro-
vided free to Australian Services. For
comparison, Australian officers serving
in Saigon and not provided with rations
are paid an allowance of $2.25 per day.
Separation allowance. Is paid to
members separated from their families
for more than 30 days.
Other hazardous duty pay. Is paid
to all U.S. Forces on duty in Vietnam.
The “Basic hazardous duty pay” is for
parachutists, those engaged in active
flying operations, and submarine crews.
For comparison the colonel quoted
here, if a pilot, would receive an extra
$7.35 per day; Australian pilots of
equivalent rank receive $1 per day
flying pay.
These facts are compiled from an
official “Table of Active Service Pay
and Allowances (Officers).”

' —of Many Letters'
In your article “A Man of Many
Letters” (8., May 13) may I point out
that my father has been drastically
misquoted in an anecdote concerning
myself, referring to the British
Regency Act?
The Regency Act, until the one in
question, had always upheld the con-
stitutional position of the heir to the
Throne, in the event of the incapa-
city of the Sovereign; or, in the event
of the Sovereign dying whilst issue
were minors, the rights of the adult
relative standing next in succession. The
point of my letter to the “SMH’ was
to protest that the rights of the Prin-
cess Margaret had been usurped (under
the then latest Regency Act) in favor
of the Duke of Edinburgh, who, whilst
having no claims to the Throne him-
self, thus would have become Regen
for the Regent a preposterous situa-
tion.
And, far from “sneaking one in,” the
letter in question was written at the
express invitation of the Editor of the
“Sydney Morning Herald,” who, in full
knowledge that I am no “expert u
these matters,” nonetheless found mj
comment worthy of consideration.
