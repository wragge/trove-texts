THE RED PAGE.
There are people who say that the before-
breakfast cigar is a good one; but personally we
have doubts about it which we have never been
able to get up early enough to solve. The follow-
ing is therefore a rhyme of only four cigars, and
anyone who tempts Providence and insolvency by
smoking five must make the necessary alterations
for simself.
Everyone who read in a recent Bulletin the
tense, attractive fragment by John Reay Watson,
of Gympie, Q.—“ Some of Fate’s Puppets’*—
must look with interest and expectation to hiß
just-published book, “In a Man’s Mind.” The
book is clever. A London publisher’s-reader
hailed Mr. Watson as possibly an Australian
Howells : local criticism has more truly found in
him something like a minor Meredith. His
imitation of Meredith’s manner and mannerisms
can hardly be unconscious. But—reasonably
enough—he isn’t Meredith. When he walks on
Meredith’s stilts without Meredith’s wit and
learning to balance him, the spectacle is tedious.
Page follows page of verbal contortions and pos-
turings like—
He put his arm round her and kissed her quiokly.
“ Your hat protests,” he said laughingly.
«It is more modest than the wearer. It is a new one,
and has never seen you before, and does not know if you
are doing right.”
“ And am I ? ”
‘‘Oh, you are doing what I expect of you.”
He put his arm round her again. “ That is kind of you,
as I read.”
She broke away from his arm. “ Head it backwards
and see what you make of it," she said triflingly.
“Nothing.”
“ That is what I frequently make of you.”
“Don’t let it trouble you, dear.”
“ It doesn’t. Nothing troubles me,” she said, arohing
to him.
“Very often, I find.”
“ Nothing from nothing.”
‘Or its equivalent."
The chief characters talk in this fashion
frequently. Space is wasted; the reader is
fatigued ; and sis conception of the story or of
its people grows no clearer—grows indeed more
confused, since man and woman in the dialogue
above are thoroughly opposed in capacity and
temperament, yet their remarks might be without
incongruity interchanged. So, generally speak-
ing, throughout the book. The persons of the
drama seem often puppets, speaking the author’s
puns in the author’s hardly-disguised voice. Their
differences and individualities you gather mostly
from the author’s asides. This is bad art, and
makes tiresome reading.
w * * •
There remains much to praise. In the oombin-
ation of literary skill and intellectual capacity, as
developed in fiction, Mr. Watson has hardly a
rival among Australian writers, past or present.
There is real power in his book —power of insight,
power of reflection, power of analysis, power of
presentation. In the dissection of motives and
impulses our noted names are tyros to him. He
is always concerned with thoughts, not with
things : has interest in deeds only as they mani-
fest men and women. And a _ very considerable
creative imagination sustains him to the close of
his story. As hinted, there is a Byronic mono-
tony about his dialogue : Jessie, and Arthur, and
Amy, and May talk always more or less as doubles
of John Reay Watson; but there is indubitable
talent in the talk, and often a ring of moving
emotion. For the twelfth chapter of “ In a
Man’s Mind ” Meredith might not be ashamed to
take credit. A page may be quoted. [Jessie a,nd
Arthur are at flood of a shallow mutual passion
born of propinquity and the need of loving—
mingled, on her side, with respect and self-
gratulation (for Arthur is exalted, desirable). But
she has thought him merely amusing himself, and
in her mind has resented his attempts at endear-
ment.]
She had no knowledge of how eager he was. She
thought that he was following her in conventional hyper-
bole, with a masculine touch stronger than her own. His
arm went round her; she thought it the utmost of
cousinly freedom and impudence, and blamed herself, but
him—she hated. She thrilled as he bent over her, and,
for a moment, a thought of him supremely manly burned
within her ; quickly darkened by her past conception of
him. She was silent; and turned to him appealingly.
He stooped and kissed her, speaking his secret. “Jessie,
you darling, I love you."
“Arthur!” The word rang in discordant notes to
him, all interpretative of he;' confusion ; he went on
eagerly—
"ls it so much of a seoret, Jessie? Did you never
know ? It has been burning within me since you came.
You darling ! you darling 1 I love you ; how does it
sound ? New and strange to you, Jessie, but to me the
dearest words in the world, they have been my nearest
oompany these many days.”
She stood chilled to inexistenoe by the breath of his
passion. He had loved her, and had always been man-
fully honest. To see her shameful past conceptions of
him falling in ruins, and he standing firmly amid that
wreck, exalted her to the clearest view of him. She was
filled with an infinite pity for her self-deluded self. The
limits of control were behind her, and with her hands to
her face, her hate of him dissolved in tears.
He took his arm from her gently, reading in her sobs,
her resistance, a recoil in listening to him, her personal
incompatibility and regrets for it. For a moment he had
a knowledge of what a small part he had in the universe.
The toil of being serious, of acting concordantly with
what manfulness lay in him, enchafed him. The touch of
death passed over him.
But she was still tearful, and her helplessness roused
him.
“ Jessie, I understand," he said; “I will not ask you
to speak. It is very sad—for both of us in a way. It is a
strange world altogether. You would that I had not
spoken, but how was I to know it would be useless? It is
my sunshine and my pain to love. You must not ask me
to give that up yet, and I will not ask you for hope. I
know now that it is impossible. Forgive me.”
He rose to divine heights in her view ; spiritually she
was at his feet. She did not love him, she knew ; but
reverence and pity, the component parts of love, she had.
But her own existence sank from her in a resolve that he
should not be sacrificed. She saw only him, not herself.
She turned to him with fire in her blood, and a pitiful
consciousness that her words were true only of the
moment.
“ Arthur, I love you, but .” She kissed his hand.
“ But I am so humbled.”
Voices filled the air; he was stunned to silence, without
one sign of mastery of her words. The surprise of them
struck him, not unconsoious of their meaning, but rather
with a fatal fulness under which he was powerless.
Her attitude was constrained. Her tears had ceased
when she spoke, but she had a handkerchief to her eyes.
He put his arm round her, and she yielded to it, with her
head on his shoulder.
They lingered in silence; her thoughts ebbed and
flowed, his endeavored to unveil the subtlety of a female
conscience, as to why she was humbled. And he came
near the truth.
Presently she lifted her handkerchief above her eyes
and looked archly at him. He kissed her, she giving the
smallest evasion of it; then she was repentant and drew
his face to hers and kissed him. She stood up, free of his
arm, and he spoke:
“ Sweetheart, shall we move ! I belong to earth again.
I am feeling airily happy.’ He paused a little, but she
stiil stood. ‘ This spct is very sacred to me. Sweetheart,
shall we move ? ’
She was idle enough to think him as only complimen-
tary, and it was here that she made a vow, out of her
happiness, that she would set herself to loving him. She
so much wanted to love him, to give him his deservings.
There was no other issue for her—she wanted no other.
• * * *
Detached, this reads a little exaggerated, ex-
travagant ; but the book is keyed up to it. ’Tis a
very well-made hook —not a set of mdepende n
episodes strung on the thread of a name or w ,
out closely inwoven to the climax, lor pi •
Arthur Palmer, clever, proud, reticent, scorning
the thought and life of the profanum rulgus, has
arrived at the lonely stage, with emotions warmed
by the spectacle of the pleasant home me
and nice fat baby where he lodges. »> ben
his cousin Jessie comes to Brisbane—it all passe
in Brisbane, and there are seductive references to
Kangaroo Point and the ferry that puffs—it is
reasonable that her plump womanhood should
stir him to something like passion. But his real
spiritual affinity is for Amy Stevenson, a rather
plain, dowdy, middle-aged shop-girl with intel-
lectual tastes and more depth than the ordinary
superficiality in petticoats. So the book shows
him drawn by the flesh towards Jessie, and y
the spirit towards Amy; and he becomes en-
gaged to Jessie and breaks off; and be wants to
become engaged to Amy also, but she, wit
superior vision, sees that he is in most things
so much her better that she would in-
evitably be a clog on his life so she
makes the grand refusal, and the curtain falls.
There is a cousin named May of considerable
interest, but her conversation is very old and
Watsony for her age —fifteen. It is of Arthur
that one gets the clearest impression—difficult
to avoid thinking that he images the author ;
but the women are good also. And on a second
reading Mr. Watson’s fantastic irrelevancies efface
themselves, and one realises how much he has
labored to make his book good and true—and
how much he has succeeded.

Of course Charles Tyne’s life of Parkes (George
Robertson & Co. ; 17s. posted) is in no accurate
sense a biography. Mr. Lyne was one of the
solid, stolid journalists whom the S.M. Herald
nourishes—industrious, meritorious, and dull. If
his relation to Parkes was not exactly that of
Clodius his umbra, it h'ad close affinity with that
of Gamaliel his feet-sitter. Lyne skirmished
round for the crumbs of news which fell from
the great politician’s table, and occasionally, no
doubt, the mouse helped the. lion.. The lion
rewarded the mouse with a civil-service position
worth .£7OO a year or so, and with an intimacy
which gave hopes of something more lasting than
the brass. Sounded, Parkes seemed. not averse;
and Lyne began to collect materials for. the
“life” he has just published. The spirit of
devout humility in which he approaches his task
is not without its esoteric charm. He pants your
brue Miltonic invocation —
What in me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise and support;
That to the height of this great argument
I may assert eternal Providence,
And justify the ways of Parkes to men.
But to justify the ways of Parkes to men would
strain the powers of a much abler advocate than
Mr. Lyne. Mr. L., therefore, has merely excused
them —by wholesale. At the end of his book
Parkes stands whiter than the snow. There
remains in him not one flaw, on him not one fly :
Mr. Lyne has covered all over, brushed all away.
He has even the air of regretting that Parkes
was not more imperfect, that he might better
show how easily his prodigious faith can swallow
the greatest imperfections. His is the old maid’s
creed : “Yes,l do believe that the whale swallowed
Jonah; and if the Bible had said that Jonah
swallowed the whale I would have believed that
too.” The “life” is a defence, an apology : had
Mr. Lyne eloquence it would be a psean. Nor, as
a rule, does he shirk the raspers. The “ Pure-
foyed ” cheques, the Kiama ghost, the Federa-
tion flight—Mr. Lyne ambles up to them, goes
through them, under them, or over them, and is
prosing away in the distance while the jibbing
reader is still looking for a decent gate. Obvi-
ously a biography written in this spirit is no
biography. Even had Mr. Lyne the capacity to
be critical, he has not the presumption. He has
barely touched Parkes’s private life—slurring over
incidents like his third marriage, which a poor-
spirited “society” finds offensive. Of the inner man
—the real Parkes—he has attempted no estimate.
The merit of his work is as a skeleton record of
Parkes’s public life; and for the conscientious
pains taken to make this accurate, and to give a
fair idea of the progress of government and the
relations of parties, Mr. Lyne deserves credit.
The labor of preparation was considerable, for he
had to disinter his facts from many musty news-
paper-files and heaps of buried reminiscences, and
to condense forty years of N.S.W. history into
three or four hundred pages. Mr. Lyne’s book is
misleading to those without independent know-
ledge of his subject; but he has done much
valuable drudgery by which Parkes’s future
biographers will benefit.

Had they been published ten years ago they
might have passed muster : time has antiquated
them trom the ranks of current criticism. Not
that Mr. Byrne was ever a critic : he has not the

his subject with the critic’s illuminating flash.

Little items—
There is wit and wisdom in I. Zangwill 3 collected
essays, *‘ Without Prejudice ; ” hut they must be read as
written, one at a time, if utmost interest be sought. And,
on the whole, they do not charm so well as in the PAU
Mall Mao*. —where they charmed by contrast. . . “Mar-
garet Ogilvy,” J. M. Barrie’s stone for the cairn of his
dead mother, is mossed with many thoughts humorous or
tender—all bringing a slightly exotic air, as if they had
been gummed on instead of growing. Of the three sup-
positions —that B. wished to pay reverential filial
tribute; that hei wished to make good copy from his
mother dead, as he had made it from her living, and
worked the pay-vein to the last load ; that his reverence-
sense and his oopy-sense were mixed —one must keep tha
most altruistic. But, in the way and with the advt.
which Barrie has managed, no base Southron could have
published his mother’s bones in a collected edition. . . .
H. G. Wells’s “ Wheels of Chance " is a readable, ephe-
meral story which kills his promise abruptly. Plainly he
is not strong enough to do permanent work. These very
bright young men lack the pith and substance of
their grandfathers—probably because their grandfather*
wasted pith and substance on riotous living. They ate
the grapes: our teeth are artificial. By next generation
the hectic weeds will have died away, and the slow,
strong men will take their turn in the cycle. . . .
Some complimentary thief gives the English review
The New Saturday, Farrell’s poem “ The Last
Bullet’’—first published in Bulletin a long time ago—
with a new title, “Lost,” and without a signature. As
an example of the now-familiar manner in which our
British brethren show their appreciation of the humble
Antipodeans this is rather more ungrateful than gratify-
ing. . . . Alex. Montgomery’s little book of fifteen
stories from The Bulletin, now issued by George
Robertson and 00. (posted from this office, Is. 9d.),
gives a fair taste of his quality. Fuller considera-
tion of its merits is this week deferred
“ Crites ”: Don't altogether agree. It is not necessary to
wonder at the outspringing of “life” from “matter.”
Wherever two or three atoms are gathered together
there is life in the midst of them. The bond which
unites molecules of sand to form a crystal is rudimentary
3ex: the force which unites them is rudimentary life.
“ Rudimentary ” if concentration be higher in
the scheme of things than expansion. There is
no evidence that it is. Probably vital concen-
tration and expansion are related as force and
recoil: life moves in a circle: and there is question not
of rise and fall, but only of change on a single plane.
Tyndall wrote of “ Heat as a Mode of Motion.” He might
have written as truly of “ Life as a Mode of Heat,”
“Matter as a Mode of Life,” “Force as a Mode of
Matter,” “ Motion as a Mode of Force,” and circumnavi-
gated his thesis. Labels for the different manifestations
of existenoe are mere conveniences. Essentially, every-
thing is one thing. This is the newest philosophy, and
the oldest, and the surest.
THE FOUR CIGARS.
There are four cigars in a good man’s day:
Four—that he loves with a good man’s love;
The first when breakfast is cleared away;
The second at lunch descends like a dove ;
With the coffee at dinner the third you light,
And a fourth at bed-time to charm the night.
The first cigar is a good cigar:
It puts to flight the mists of the morn.
So calm I so cool! ’tis an avatar
Of blisses held by the day new-born:
Tou front the world like a god of war
As the nerves thrill taut to the first cigar.
The second cigar is a good cigar:
It brings a pause in the day’s hot deeds,
And sets to the outer strife a bar
For the sacred hour that the spirit needs:
Tou are heartened and strengthened—the man go<6 tar
Who gives due weight to his lunch-cigar.
The third cigar is a good cigar :
It lights a glow in the veiling eyes ;
And the brain-clouds gathering eve to mar
Pass with the clouds that it bids arise.
Ho ! Cupid spies it—the chink ajar
In the armor loosed by the third cigar I
But the best cigar is the last cigar ;
For the grey days teem with worries and woes
To be soothed away, and the g Aden are
By its magic drawn to a golden close:
And I fly with Mab in the fairies’ car
As the smoke curls up from my last cigar.
And fast through ether we glide till loom
Luxurious realms of reverie, sow’n
With roses, roses snatched from the bloom
Of the girl I love, yet never have known:
Whose eyes, caught once on a crowded pier,
Sent her soul for ever to linger—here 1
And when the last sweet breath is thrown
To the fragrant air, and the sad stump dies,
I seek my pillow—but not alone,
For the dusk is lit by her shining eyes ;
And I clasp her fondly—my love !my atari
In an ecstasy born of the last cigar.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, B’JION-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as. taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much w’orse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed-suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success. I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

at the root of the disease. The symptoms gradually dis-
appear, vigor and lost health return, sunken ej’es retain
their old lustre. The blood-giving principle of the medi-
cine secures a healthy appearance, the patient finds
himself gaining in weight and flesh, hollow and sunken
cheeks become rounded ; the weak and shattered consti-
tution is restored, and the former sufferer finds himself
permanently cured with all the animation and vigor of
life.

Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a SiVrgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
SPECIAL DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men
who suffer from any of the following symptoms,
namely : —Frequent headaches, giddiness, drowsi-
ness in the daytime, irregularity of the bowels,
feeling of fullness after eating, specks before the
eyes, halos or circles round a candle, cold hands
and feet, pains in the back or under the shoulder-
blade, tenderness of the breast-bone on pressure,
palpitation of the heart, clammy hands, an
aversion to society, a fear of something dreadful
about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, &c.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt of 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,

fully describing how all SPECIAL DISEASES
may be quickly and permanently CURED,
without loss of time and money. This book

restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.

Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you'
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your case, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, sqnd 6d. in

questions that will assist you in giving a true

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The cabled story of a certain Mazhar Bey
is interesting as showing the ways of British and
other kinds of justice. Mazhar, a Turk, was ac-
cused by the British and Trench embassies of
having a hand in the murder of a French priest
and according to the cable news the ambassadors
demanded that he should be tried and that the
feultan should take all needful precautions to pre-
vent his acquittal. He was tried and acquitted
an d it is now cabled that the ambassadors demand
he should be tried again, and that this timegreater
care shall be taken to make sure of a conviction
Under these circumstances it seems that the miser-
able Turk might as well be hanged without a trial.
If he is to be tried over and over again till he is
convicted and the Sultan is to take special
measures to see that the court convicts him, then
he is bound to be convicted some time whether he
is guilty or not. Why not simply demand the
head of the lost Ottoman in good old piratical
fashion, and drop the bogus trial altogether ?
FORTY MILES FOR A KISS.
Wifi, cr ? s ® e d our hands as old comrades do.
Vith a light farewell at the dawn of day,
JBut well we knew
lhat Love’s adieu
is taken in different mood and way
ion stars are out and the skies are gray.
Asfthi u’ Whthe tw( ? ]on S days had passed,
As the iaggard sunset slowly showed,
At last, at last,
un W i th h °of-beat fast,
T i a T mare took to the river road
lhat winds its way to my love’s abode.
4 3! le i g< j d stars sang to us merrily,
‘ Tj? g , ad was the music the shod hoofs made,
Lach whispering tree
opoke sympathy,
And down in the river the ripples played
Capped with silver and shod with shade.
dUBt COafce , d n) y red spurs round ;
For fll \ ° am both rein and mane;
1 or Hanks must feel
The sting of steel
“Sulf winds sing us the sweet refrain
lo hold her hand in your hand again ! ”
Thr< sp?ead the darkling shadows to Eastward
The red moon blazed in the myall-trees—
-1 hus hearts have bled !
The faster sped
The tireless hoofs for the signs like these
lhat mortals must follow if Love shall please.
Un h l r 0 Z eS ? re T rapping y° ur window-glass.
(Oh, my beating heart ! be still, be still')
Across the grass
Your light feet pass,
And I have leave as I have the will
Ihe void of your soft, white arms to fill.
You never doubted my love, my love—
We never doubted, yourself and I,
lnat this lone grove
Would watch above
While both our hearts in a bitter cry
Were woven into one wild “ Good-bye ! ”
Cling, cling white arms ! there is no one hears :
lhere are none to watch us but moon and star.
I is a rain of tears :
But the long, long years !
iVw thll \ k ’ t S 1 dm ! k where your sweet lips are,
If forty miles by a mile too far !
GLENROWAN.
MY CHRISTMAS.
0n a r^ g all hot and dus ty, in the God-forgotten
Where the lurid sun in fiery strength is burning,
1 am tramping with my bluey, on this so-called
day of rest,
And the while my thoughts to other worlds are
turning;
And my senses, as they wander, place me in a
city’s throng,
now the well-dressed masses as they
And their jdad and laughing faces as they gaily
Tell of peace to-day, whate’er may come to-
morrow.
In “y faru; y for a moment now I hear a tolling bell
Kingmgout acheerful, happy Christmas greeting
But the shoulder-strap reminds me of this blind-
ing, burning Hell,
06 ear st;arv ed sheep
And is this the day they’re singing “Peace on
earth, goodwill to men ! ”
P’ra’ps it’s proper I should, too, be humbly
kneeling; 3
Put your parsons and your godly on my : lonely
track, and then
At the end of time enquire their honest feeling.
Once to-day a buggy passed me, in a cloud of
reddish dust,
And their “ Merry Christmas ! ” through the
mist came ringing.
To the swagman slowly toiling such a greeting is
unjust, &
Makes the bitter, longing feeling still more
clinging.
Is it wonder that the bushman, with the wretched
life he lives—
With his pleasures ever limited and scanty—
Wastes his substance and his money for the
company it gives,
On his lonely travels, at the wayside -shanty ?

Held avoids with a great deal of success the
part of an over-impetuous federal leader.
Instead of rushing on to any dangerously
forward ground, he adopts a policy of exces-
sive caution, which those who have looked
to him for inspiration and stimulus will re-
gard with feelings of disappointment.
This is more like
the tone of a paan agreeing to follow than of
one eager to load. And there Is in it some-
thing resembling a note of appeal against
the road being made too hard.

sideration of the matter could induce anyone

SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1897.
Parochialism in the Commonwealth.
Since the date for the election of delegates
to the Federal Convention was fixed, candi-
dates, formerly very scarce and very silent,
have begun to appear and to put their views
before the electors. So far, those which
New South Wales has turned out are a dis-
appointing lot. They are mostly affected in
a greater or less degree with the idea, so
strangely common in the province, that, for
some reason which is never very clearly ex-
plained, New South Wales, as a place of
special and awful importance, can’t federate
on quite the same terms as any other and
more ordinary province might. Also, every
one who, so far, has expounded his views at
length is mostly concerned about how to
withhold all possible influence from the
Federal Government and make it, to the
best of his ability, a mere shadow, a well-
meaning concern entrusted with a certain
sketchy commission to implore its component
parts to behave themselves, and nothing
more. The powers which most of these
provincial-souled individuals propose to en-
trust to the central authority are so small
and mean and narrow that, if they have their
way, the Commonwealth Parliament will be
of less account than the mere State legisla
tures, and the part will be greater than the
whole. It is to be something like one of the
far-back emperors of Germany—a Wences-
laus or a Richard of Cornwall—in the time
when ,a German emperor was next door to
an outcast, and often had not where to lay
his crown. If these narrow views were ad-
vanced by the small fry of politics it would
matter little. But when a man of the calibre
of that eminent lawyer, R. E. O’Connor,
M.L.C., seriously expresses the opinion that
the railways and the public debts should be
left under provincial control, and when other
men of local note follow his lead, it is time
i) ask these individuals what there is left
that is much worth federating about. The
railways, more than anything else in Aus-
tralia, need to be put under federal control,
and the reasons which Mr. O’Connor gives
for excepting them are just the reasons, above
all others, why they should not be so ex-
cepted. Said reasons are announced in the
candidate’s published address as follows :
I am altogether opposed to handing over the railway
systems of the several colonies to Federal control. Our
railway policy has always been to build railways, not
only for the benefit of particular localities, but also for
the general benefit of our own colony. Our railway sys-
tem has been devised and maintained with the object of
keeping and concentrating within our own borders the
trade of our own people. In the other colonies a similar
railway policy has been pursued. I cannot understand
upon what equitable basis railways constructed on such
a system could be handed over to the Federal power, nor
can I see any advantage in exchanging the existing con-
trol and management, with its local aims and policy,
for a Federal control and management, whose policy
would necessarily be of quite a different kind. It will be
necessary, no doubt, to give the Federal power control of
the railways for the movement of Federal troops or muni-
tions of war. Except in regard to such matters I see no
reason why each State should not carry out its own railway
system just as at present.
» * * »
The above are exactly the reasons why
The Bulletin holds that the railway sys-
tems of Australia should be under
federal control. The object of the present
system, as Mr. O’Connor truly states, is
not to give the producer an outlet to the
nearest port, or to give him the shortest
and cheapest access to a market, but to
make him send his goods to and get his
supplies from Melbourne or Sydney or
Adelaide or Brisbane for the benefit
of the importers and traders and
commission-agents and auctioneers and
boomers thereof. The present system flatly
refuses to supply means of communication
to a port 200 miles away if it is in the terri-
tory of another province, even if the alterna-
tive is that the farmer and squatter have to
pay 500 miles of railage to a port in the pro-
vince to which they accidentally belong. It
is a deliberate policy of sacrificing the in-
terests of the whole country to the interests
of three or four cities, and its declared object
is to prevent trade finding its easiest and
most natural outlet in order that the city
parasites may benefit thereby. There is
probably nothing which has done more injury
to Australia than its chaotic railway policy,
and if Federation does not put this matter
right, then its principal advantage will be
deliberately thrown away.
* * * *
There are, in continental Australia, three
distinct railway gauges. Passengers and
goods coming northward from Victoria have
to be unloaded from one set of vehicles and
loaded on to another at the New South Wales
border because the cars which were built for
the sft. 3in. gauge of the southern province
are of no use on the 4ft. gauge of New
South Wales. Further north they have to
be transhipped again where the 4ft. B|in.
gauge of New South Wales changes to the
3ft. 6in. gauge of Queensland. Going into
South Australia, the Victorian cars can travel
as far as Adelaide, and then on the northern
line from Adelaide the sft. 3in. gauge changes
to 3ft. 6in. again. Though 4ft. B|in. is the
standard gauge in New South Wales, one of its
local railways is built on the sft. 3in. principle
while the gauge of another is 3ft. 6in. In case
of invasion it would be impossible to rapidly
concentrate men and munitions from the
various provinces on the point where assist-
ance was needed ; much of the South Aus-
tralian rolling stock which might carry rein-
forcements right through to Sydney or Bris-
bane would be useless anywhere this side of
Adelaide, and if other trains and engines
could not be provided in sufficient numbers
amid the confusion, the assistance which was
so urgently wanted would be left behind.
The Victorian trains could not carry assist-
ance to Sydney, nor those of New South
Wales to Brisbane or Melbourne, nor those
of Queensland to either of the southern
provinces, and in the general excitement
and over-strain and breakdown such scanty
forces as Australia could command would
probably be left stranded in instalments at
the various borders. The present system
also causes much needless expense in load-
ing, unloading and re-loading. It and the
divided management prevent economy in the
matter of rolling-stock ; the vehicles which
are not wanted in one province where trade
is bad cannot be utilised in another where it
is unusually active, so they lie by and rot on
sidings and under sheds. It is generally
agreed that the break of gauge is a great
evil, and each province is willing that it
should be remedied by all the rest adopting
its gauge at their own expense. But there
is no authority which can decide on a uni-
form gauge, and make the needed alteration,
and charge the expense thereof to the
country at large, and until the railways are
placed under Federal control there never
will be.
* * ' * *
The provincial policy which Mr. R. E.
O’Connor and others are so anxious to per-
petuate is still more ruinous in other ways.
A great part of western New South Wales
beyond the Darling might be watered with
artesian wells, and made valuable, if there
was a sufficiently cheap outlet for its pro-
ducts, but the expense of building an enor-
mous length of railway to connect with
Sydney is too great, and the produce could
not stand the necessarily heavy railway
charges if the line was built, and the bill for
interest would be too great to be covered
by any traffic likely to be obtained for
at least a century. And the great pro-
vincial principle forbids any railway con-
nection being made with Port Augusta,
which is near and convenient, so the West
remains a lost province, which, because it
can’t be developed from Sydney, must not
be developed at all, and New South Wales
loses much through a fear that its hated
neighbour may possibly gain a little. There
is a large extent of fertile country in the
extreme east of Gippsland whose most con-
venient outlet would be by railway to the
splendid harbour of Twofold Bay in New
South Wales. But the parochial railway
policy forbids Victoria to supply any outlet
except by far-off Melbourne. South-western
Queensland has a short and convenient outlet
to the sea by Port Augusta, but Queensland
policy dictates that it must do without rail-
way communication until an enormously long
line can be completed to take its produce at
twice as much expense as is necessary to
Brisbane, and while it is waiting for a boon
which will be very little worth having when
it arrives, south-western Queensland must
remain a desert. Under the provincial sys-
tem railways cost vastly more than they need
do, because no matter how much extra dis-
tance is involved they must end at the local
capital for the local capital’s private and
individual benefit. Therefore, many places
which might easily have railway communica-
tion are deprived of it, and many which
have it are burdened with longer distances
and heavier fares and freight charges than
are at all necessary. Federation ought to
remove these disadvantages, but it is actually
proposed that special arrangements be made
to perpetuate them, and that they should be
preserved as something beautiful and sacred.
Australia is chokeful of anomalies created
by the provincial railway system. Most of
the Riverina district could find an outlet for
its exports at Melbourne with just one-half
the distance to travel which is involved by
dealing with Sydney, but provincial exi-
gencies require that its system must connect
with Sydney, and that connection with Mel-
bourne shall be as far as possible cut off.
The western Riverina is deprived of railway
communication altogether because Sydney is
so far off that a line would be hopelessly un-
payable, and it is contrary to the great Kil-
kenny cat policy to promote any connection
with Melbourne or Adelaide. The western
region of Victoria is a desert, largely
because of the same policy. The transcon-
tinental line, which would make the deserted
northern coasts accessible and habitable and
add another huge province to Australia, re-
mains little better than a dream because no
one province is rich enough to build such a
work by itself. If it ever is built it will
doubtless be worked, in the good old pro-
vincial way, to bring all the available trade
to Adelaide, and any connections east-
ward with the systems of adjacent
provinces will be avoided as far as pos-
sible lest they should divert business. All
this is irrespective of the unnecessary cost
of so many separate managements, and the
losses through the reduced rates granted
where two provincial systems meet, and
where each province struggles to attract the
business of the other to its particular Little
(or middle-sized) Pedlington.
♦ * * *
The proposal, which seems to have many
advocates among New South Wales politi-
cians, that the various public debts shall
also remain detached and under provincial
control, is even less comprehensible. The
separate-railway idea is obviously the out-
come of narrow provincial jealousy ; the
other is the outcome of no visible cause
whatever. It cannot be supposed that one
set of Australian politicians would be more
incapable or dishonest or extravagant than
five or six, or that the credit of all' Australia
would be worse than that of the detached
provinces, or that the prominent men who
commanded the politics of the Federation
would be less trustworthy than the second-
rate ones who were left behind in the State
Legislatures. Probably, if the Federal Par-
liament is constituted on the lines suggested
by some prominent New South Wales poli-
ticians, no one will regret it more than they
—later on. At present they are mostly
members of local Parliaments and think
maiidy of the authority they are giving
away, and the political impotence to
which they are reducing themselves ; conse-
quently their desire is to give away as little
authority and to give it as grudgingly as
possible. Later on, many of them will be
members of the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment, and will look at the matter from
a different standpoint. Then they will
find that they have deprived themselves of
power, and made themselves as weak and
useless and impotent as possible, and that
they have been agitating to prevent the
people entrusting them with authority to do
much good for Australia. R. E. O’Connor,
as a parochial M.L.C., demanding, from a
parochial standpoint, that the Parliament of
the Commonwealth shall be deprived of its
most important functions is one thing. The
same O’Connor, as a member of the
Commonwealth Parliament Avith no autho-
rity worth mentioning, compelled to look on
while Wilks and Whiddon and Smailes and
the other small men ivho are left behind
mismanage the largest concerns of the com-
munity, and constantly reminded that, by his
own showing, Wilks and Whiddon and
Smailes and the other parochial remains are
the only men who can be fitly entrusted with
such important matters, will probably be
quite another and a different matter.
Some Federation Critics.
Sydney is the one Freetrade city of Australia
therefore in Sydney the importer is dominant!
And the importer is mostly British and German,
lhere are 4| columns of him in the Sydney
Directory and a large proportion of the names
are something akin to Feldheim and Schutze
and Dietrich and Wkbendorfer and Max
Something-or-other, and the atmosphere of the
Fatherland is over the page generally. And
the names that are not suggestive of the Rhine
are largely Hebraic ; and the names that might
be either British or Australian mostly pioxe,
on close investigation of their owners, to be
British, and to be those of men who are merely
agents for British firms and representatives of
British capital. The importer, as a rule, is not
Australian. The destiny of this country in-
terests him very little, except in so far as it
relates to the country’s ability to pay for his
foreign-made goods. The making of an Aus-
tralian nation matters to him about as little,
because there is no reason to believe that an
Australian nation will buy more imported calico
than the six dissevered provinces would do.
The arousing of a national spirit affects the
importer whose name sounds like Book or
SCHWILLE.N'SADFENGEKMANSAUSAOESCHEWE-
dischturnipstein not one cent, because Bock
and the other man live very well under the
present system and don’t want to take any
risks. The same remark applies to the importer
whose name is Smith or MAC-Something, and
whose head-quarters are in London instead
of Hamburg. The importing crowd live
by open ports and by discouraging local
industry to make room for imports. Fede-
ration will probably put an awkward bar-
rier across the open ports and sacrifice
the foreigner for the benefit of Australian in-
dustry, therefore the importers are against
Federation. The importers own the Sydney
morning press, body and soul, therefore the press
is more than lukewarm. The importers and
the press together own Premier Reid, and
Reid owns Brunker and Jacob Garrard —
therefore the N.S. W. Government is also tepid,
or even a little colder than that.
* * * *
The importers’ conspiracy against Federation
rage 3 furiously in the correspondence-columns
of the morning papers. It is backed up by
astounding lips and garbled figures, or figures
that are pure invention, to show the losses
which will fall on New South Wales by a union
with the other provinces, and how New South
Wales will be plundered for the benefit of
everybody, and will lose everything and gain
nothing. The most pertinacious correspondent
of all is one Freeman Kitchen (secretary of
the Patriotic Federation League, headed by
Mr. L. F. Heydon and shored up by Major
Lassetter, of the big Sydney iron-importers),
a gentleman who runs a little paper which is
owned by the aforesaid iron-importers, and
therefore speaks in the importing interest as
one having authority. The following is one
item in Kitchen’s logic :
As New South Wales can borrow at 3 per cent., and is,
as a matter of fact, paying- less per head of the population
for interest than any other colony, she loses heavily by
pooling her debt with the rest of Australia. For example,
New South Wales pays £1 Bs. per annum per head of popu-
lation for interest, Queensland pays £2 16s. per head,
and Victoria pays £1 14s. per head, so that we are practi-
cally burdening ourselves with a vast amount of extra
debt for the sake of creating an ideal federal union, which
will benefit everybody but ourselves. The handing over
of our railways to federal control is also another way to
impose a further loss upon this colony. We are paying
interest upon the cost of construction ; last year our rail-
ways returned £3 12s. per cent, upon their capital cost;
Queensland, which borrows at a higher rate than we do,
only managed to show a return of £2 13s. Bd. per cent. ;
while Victoria is still worse, only yielding £2 6s. per cent.
In all, we should have to share an added annual burden
of several millions as our part in the glories of federated
Australia—to be made up by additional taxation.
* * * •
This would be a convincing statement if it
were true, but it isn’t. According to Coghlan’s
“Seven Colonies” (page 392),in 1896 Westralia’s
interest bill was £1 9s. sd. annually per in-
habitant ; Victoria’s was £1 11s. lOd. ; that of
New South Wales was £1 15s. lid. Therefore
the figures of Freeman Kitchen stand con-
victed, on the best official authority, of being
pure invention, and the story built upon them
about the loss incurred by New South Wales if
it allies itself with its neighbors is convicted of
being invention of a very mean kind. Further,
the N.S.W. railways don’t pay interest on
cost of construction and have only done so
once or twice in all the years of their existence,
and those rare occasions are so far back as to be
almost out of sight and memory. The only
railways in Australia which pay interest and
working expenses are those of Westralia ; S.A.
has the smallest deficit, and New South Wales
ranks third with the next smallest deficit. But
even if the statement above quoted w r ere true,
which it certainly is not, it only covers half the
case. When the various public debts are
handed over to the Commonwealth Government,
and along with them the railways and the rail-
ways deficits, the posts and telegraphs and any
other revenue-producing assets which were
built with the proceeds of the said debts, New
South Wales will show a deficit of £1,158,000 ;
Victoria a deficit of .£1,012,000; S.A.’
£488,000; Tasmania, £302,000 ; and Wes-
tralia £33,000. Taking them all round, accord-
ing to population, Victoria and Westralia are
the only provinces which would lose anything
by federating on equal terms, and they would
lose very little. New South Wales would gain
a trifle, but not much, and S.A. and Tasmania
would gain rather more. Also, N.S. W., instead
of getting “a vast amount of extra debt’” would
shunt a large portion of her burden on Vic-
toria, which is, according to population, far the
least indebted province of the four. In fact
every one of the alleged sacrifices that are
dwelt upon so pathetically by the editor of the
impoiters publication is absolutely non-exis
tent.

The same advocate of provincialism draws
another gruesome picture—
If all the goods for the Riverina, the Darling, and the
dl . st V cts are to b e derived from the nearest
Fs the n Sa /’ the . p ° rts outside our colony—how

these goods to be made up to this colony ? Taking even
our present tariff, the loss of duties upon spirits, tobaccos,

£-00,000. What, then, would become of the Customs
duties upon all the goods going to two-thirds of our
territory, then lost to the trade of Sydney ? They would

, then only be a source of expense to our colony and
no benefit of any kind or description. No federalist has
yet dared to suggest that two-thirds of the New- South
Wales territory should be handed over to other colonies
He would be howled down. Yet what has been proposed
is infinitely more ruinous, for it means handing P ovFr all
Presumably the Sydney importer hasn’t a very


lngh opinion of the intelligence of his audience
when he passes this eminently dull piece of
stupidity upon them. When the Federal
Government is responsible for the debts and
sundry other liabilities of all Australia, it must
pay them out of the customs revenue. Even if
all the Sydney customs revenue was. collected
at Melbourne, or all the Melbourne revenue at
Sydney, or all of them both at Booligal or
Mallacoota Inlet, they would have to be applied
to the same purpose, and each province would
get the same benefit out of them. Yet even
with this Kitchen isn’t quite the most foolish
of the provincialists who pervade the daily
newspapers. One Harrison writes to say
that under Federation New South Wales
will have to take over the “bad invest-
ments of other colonies, say £l6,ooo,ooo’’—the
unprofitable investments of the four federating
provinces, by the way, are, roughly speaking,
£20,000,000, and N.S. W supplies £8,000,000
of this amount. The same scribe alleges that
the province will also lose its “outstanding
assets secured on lands ” —whatever the assets
may be and however they came to be “secured.”
The dreadful L. F. Heydon writes to say
thatN.S.W. will be “stripped of her terri-
tory,” and points out indignantly, as an evi-
dence of the malice the other provinces bear
against N.S.W., that they refused to vote
for Windeyer, of Mount Rennie, as Austra-
lian Judge on the Privy Council ! Heydon
also points out as a dire injustice that “Mel-
bourne and Adelaide will have two votes to
Sydney’s one,” which seems quite likely. Also,
Sydney and Adelaide will have two votes to
Melbourne’s one, and Sydney and Melbourne
will have two votes to Adelaide’s one, and Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Sydney will have several
votes to Hobart’s one or fraction of one, and so
it looks pretty even all round. It would be
interesting to know if Mr. Heydon could sug-
gest any equitable device by which things would
be otherwise.
* * * *
Heydon, however, is merely a circumstance,
and not much of that ; the importing interest is
the real mainstay of the provincial movement.
All over Australia the importer is distinctly
against Federation, and men named Schwabe
and various things ending in ’hoch are rising in
protest with surprising unanimity. When it
seemed likely that Queensland would stand in
with the movement, the air was rent with the
plaint of the Brisbane importers that union
would mean the absorption by Sydney of the
trade of that sad and sweltering city, and it
would sink into ruin, and grass would grow in
its streets and banana-trees spring up on the
tram-lines. The fear that Sydney would scoop
the trade of Brisbane did a lot to scare Queens-
land out of the movement, and the fear that
Brisbane will seize a great deal of the trade of
Sydney is being used to scare N.S. W. out of it
also. Another bogey is that Federation will
enable S.A. to take the trade of Broken Hill,
which is a wild irrelevance, seeing that S. A. has
got it already. In Melbourne, the importing in-
terest is comparatively weak, but w'hat there is
of it is also bitterly hostile, the theory being that
when the border tariff is abolished the trade of
Maoriland, Queensland, and the Asiatic and
American ports will centre at Sydney, and
goods will come in at the back-door via Albury,
and Melbourne will become largely superfluous.
And a tearful voice from Adelaide points out
that just now the S.A. ports have all the
Barrier trade (the same trade which Freeman
Kitchen alleges S.A. is just going to annex
when Federation comes in), and that it repre-
sents a most valuable part of their commerce.
But the Federal Government, it is reckoned,
may try to establish direct railway communi-
cation between Sydney and Adelaide, and, if
so, the Broken Hill ores will go straight
to the N.S. W. sea-board to be smelted
where the coal-supply is, and the S.A. ports
will be left in the lurch, and something large
and vague and ghostly will ensue. So the
traders of four Australian capitals are troubled
more or less —three of them very badly—lest
Federation should take the trade of all of them
away and leave them desolate like Babylon or
Ramoth-Gilead or some unpronounceable place
in Holy Writ. And the importers of Sydney,
who are (or think or pretend they are) Free-
traders to the last German and the very last
Englishman, and who demand at election-time
that trade should be allowed to “ follow' its
natural channels,” now write to the papers and
damn the natural channels with a great damn,
on the ground that if something happens some-
thing dreadful will ensue, and the conse-
quences wdll naturally be awful. And, as a
smaller damn comes from everywhere else, it
would seem that no Australian city has suffi-
cient confidence in itself to reckon that it can
hold its own against the others without artifi-
cial assistance, and that they are the worst-
scared lot of capitals going.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Law and the Lunatic.
The suicide of one “ Professor ” Eckenstein,
in Melbourne, the other week, had an unlooked-
for bearing on the administration of justice—so
unlooked-for that nobody thusfar appears to
have remarked it. About a month previously
Eckenstein figured incognito as a principal
witness in a hotel licensing case. He gave evi-
dence on behalf of the police who opposed the
renewal of the license, and he created a public
scandal (which now appears more scandalous
than at first) by obtaining the court’s permis-
sion to withhold his name from publication.
Eckenstein, the “ mysterious witness,” testi-
fied that during a visit to the hotel in question,
he had lost a scarf-pin, value 155., whilst enjoy-
ing a private tdte-a-tete with one of the bar-
maids. His tale, of course, was uncorro-
borated, even the statement of his having
worn a scarf-pin when he entered the bar was
open to question, but the man raved about his
loss until the landlady gave him 15s. to
stop his mouth. Then the contemptible
brawler was engaged by the police to
-ome forward and accuse the landlady of
keeping an improper pub. It happened that
the license was renewed. The Court, having
made an ass of itself in permitting witness
Eckenstein to conceal his identity, ruled that
the police case had broken down, or something
to the same effect. As though for the purpose
of bringing the Court into further ridicule, and
putting an end to the “ nameless witness ”
business, this same Eckenstein put an end to
himself with a revolver, thereby revealing at
one fell pop the worthlessness of his evidence
and the reason why he desired to keep himself
dark. A coroner’s inquest proved him to be an
intermittent lunatic, suffering from a morbid
belief that his brother was always seeking
opportunities to “ put him away.” The brother,
likewise the mother, of the suicide told the
coroner s jury that their unfortunate relative
had delusions.” A boardinghouse-keeper
had noticed that “ he used to exaggerate,” and
she “,put him down as a fearful story-
teller.” In short, mad Eckenstein’s state-
ment on oath was not worth a curse.
His story about losing the scarf-pin at the pub.
was probably a hallucination, yet it might have
succeeded in stopping the landlady’s license but
for his other hallucination prompting him to
ask the Court’s leave to keep his name dark.
The inquest on Eckenstein shows at once the
necessity for post-mortem enquiry into the
public histories of such men. Justice demands
to know whether he, or any other proved vic-
tim to brain disease, has given important evi-
dence in any sort of law-case. A lunatic, dur-
ing his time of generally accepted sanity, might
hang an innocent person, “in the interests of
society,” therefore, as soon as the truth con-
cerning the poor devil becomes known to the
authorities, the authorities should look back to
discover whether the hallucinator, acting as
their friend and ally, has brought anybody to
undeserved grief. Hoes the Law keep an index
of important witnesses in criminal or civil cases,
in which it can make an easy search for the
names of suicides and lunatic-asylum patients?
The Man Who’s Dead.
From a legal point of view, the awful murder of
bookkeeper Brady, in Melbourne, would seem
not more shocking than the murderer’s confes-
sional statement, when the whole process bf its
literary manufacture is considered critically.
Brady having been slaughtered at the store
where he kept the books, certain detectives
were called in to find a possible cause for his
suicide or murder, and the newspapers promptly
announced a discovery of 500 letters, from an
indefinite number of Women, in the dead man’s
desk. Within 48 hours of his death, Brady
figured in the daily press as a colossal libertine,
a wholesale seducer, a huge black spider en-
tangled in the meshes of his own intrigues with
Women. Upon a modest salary of £4 10s. per
week the amorous bookkeeper had —in the
newspaper picture-maintained illicit relations
with Women by the score The tragedy might
be a case of suicide or murder, but, as to Women
having brought it about, there was no journalistic
doubt whatever. Presently the detectives felt
sure that Brady had been murdered, and
one Phillips, a former clerkling in the office,
was arrested on strong suspicion. Then the
press, already convinced of Phillips’ guilt and
treating him accordingly, proceeded to link
Brady, Phillips, and Women together. The
man and the youth had been twin brothers “on
the mash,” sang the chorus of morning and
evenin’ horror reporters, and the crime was
probably the outcome of jealousy concerning
Women. Circumstantial evidence against
Phillips came rolling in, until at last his un-
happy father, who had engaged a firm of
solicitors to defend the youth, sent word to
him that his family wished him to speak out
and conceal nothing. Whereupon a clerk of the
firm went to Melbourne gaol—but let him give
the game away in his own words to an Argus
reporter:
I saw the boy. I told him the arrangement we had
entered into with his father, and he expressed his pleasure
at the evidence of his father’s interest in him. He asked
at once for the newspapers, and I handed them to him.
He commenced to read them carefully, and when I
questioned him on several points he answered me at
random. He appeared to be making up his mind to do
something, and at last he said, “ I am going to tell you
as my legal adviser that I did the murder.” He then
related practically the same circumstances as are set out
in his statement.
The clerk’s narrative allows one to assume
that he carried a bundle of newspapers
to the gaol, which newspapers were full
of the sensational “ Women ” theory. The
murderer read them carefully, he was so ab-
sorbed in the Women revelations that he
answered questions at random, and when he
had made up his mind as to the best way of
turning the Women to account, he told his
little tale. The clerk carried the tale to
Phillips, senior, and the wise father, perceiv-
ing that it was good—the best thing possible—
for defence purposes, advised its immediate
publication. The law-clerk went back to the
prisoner, prepared a rough draft of his confes-
sional yarn, and “took it away, promising him to
make a copy of it, and bring it to him next day to
sign.” Then the lawyer-man edited the rough
draft, and padded it judiciously, and next
morning he placed the autobiography before the
prisoner, who signed it sheet by ‘sheet, saying
“ Yes, that represents what I dictated to you,
and it is perfectly true.” A few hours later
Melbourne was flooded with the news that
Phillips had been aided and abetted by Brady
in a mad pursuit of strange Women. One result
of his “successes with Women,” said the ean-
did penitent in his edited statement, was a
craving for new shirts and collars, which led
him to steal money from the shop amounting to
£1 in all. After getting discharged from
the shop, he was in the habit” of call-
ing upon Brady to talk about Women
and the shortage in his cash, and when Brady
finally required him to pay £2O instead
of £1 back into the till, or petty cash, he slew
the bookkeeper in a moment of passion.
Phillips had shaped his story to suit the news-
paper accounts that he read so carefully. For
the next few hours he appeared to superficial
readers of his “confession” as a much-to-be-
pitied victim of circumstances arising from
Brady’s evil counsels and bad companionship
re Women. A sympathetic public agreed that
it was just what everybody had expected.
Then the newspapers, having in the meantime
published idiotic leading articles on the precious
“ confession,” began to burst up the Women
theory. Brady’s 500 letters from innumer-
able Women were boiled down to 300
highly respectable communications from four
young ladies of “ unimpeachable character.”
The alleged intimacy between Brady and
Phillips was denied, and all the other original
“ Women ” disclosures were declared to be quite
inconsistent with the apparent facts of Brady’s
career as far as his friends and employers can
speak from knowledge and reasonable belief.
At the present moment, young Phillips’ con-
fession looks like a romance put into his head
by the daily press (the great, impartial daily
press), and its publication through the medium
of a firm of solicitors—well, as usual in Mel-
bourne, it’s the man who’s dead that did all the
mischief.
The Q. Labor Split.
The Q. Labor-party is an interestingly awkward
squad. Its strength lies, for the most part, in
the Western bush-laborers, though the miners
are usually among its supporters, and it has
adherents not always reliable among the
artisans of the towns. It gets small help from
the farmers—who are either servile or conser-
vative ; too suspicious for union and too selfish
for sacrifices. At the head of the unions which
raise its funds are delegates—sometimes sensible
and earnest, often glib-tongued and windy,
securing their own advancement by lurid ora-
tory about “ the Cause.” The extremist section
of the party lives among the bush-workers—as
a rule incapable of apprehending the gulf be-
tween desire and performance, and cheering not
for the leader who shows them what is possible,
but for the one who promises what they want —
heedless of possibilities. The motto of The
Worker —“ Socialism in Our Time is now
chiefly maintained as a sop to these extremists,
who would probably make the Brisbane
“ leaders ” totter in their seats were any with-
drawal attempted. It is excused on the plea
that it is merely set forward as an ideal to
strive for, not as a reform which is demanded,
or even one which is keenly desired. The
aggregation of unions and their delegate repre-
sentatives makes the first considerable force
in the Queensland Labor-party. The second is
the knot of officials—nominally elective, but
really made permanent by uninterrupted
exercise of authority—who are the mouthpieces
of the unions, and form the coterie directing
the subsidised union newspaper, the Worker.
It consists of a few men of ordinary abilities,
whose conscientious persistence has won the
respect of even their opponents. It is unfor-
tunate that they are tethered by their past and
by a policy formulated when they had hardly
commenced their political education. The
third substantial force of the Queensland
Labor-party is the score of members elected to
the Legislative Assembly—who have changed
surprisingly in the atmosphere of Parliament.
And on the wing of these hang th'e representa-
tives of what might be called moderate Demo-
cracy-men like Kidstoh, of Rockhampton,
who express a general sympathy with the
Labor platform, but object to “Socialism in
Our Time,” and refuse to be dominated by the
Labor caucus. To all these elements the
recent Govt, proposals to keep the Queens-
land N. Bank afloat came demanding an opinion,
and most of the bush workers considered
that the institution was proved rotten root and
branch, and the sooner it was cut down and
cast into the fire of liquidation the better it
would be for honest business and honest poli-
tics. The idea that Labor would suffer materi-
ally by the pricking of false values and the call
upon overdrafting politicians to meet their
engagements was laughed at. Sheep and cattle
would still increase, mines would still yield,
crops would still be harvested—and the in-
famous business of feeding the bank with pub-
lic loans of which the community lost the in-
terest and would possibly one day lose the
principal, would be ended once and for all.
The Worker espoused this view of the case
vigorously, and its able exposure of the bank’s
utter rottenness put to shame the pretentious
and time-serving Courier. But the Labor
members were found suddenly and singularly
lukewarm. The Govt., realising the import-
ance of the occasion, made tremendous en-
deavors to influence them to favor its ends.
They were wheedled in detail, and most suc-
cessfully. The legislative Labor lion, roaring
ruin to the Q. JST. B. and all its works,
changed in one ludicrous fortnight to a
lamb breathing blessings over Palmer and
Morehead, MTlwraith and the ashes of
Drury. As a result, The Worker found
itself vigorously opposing its own allies. It is
opposing them still. It has had no trouble in
showing that its attitude is the reasonable and
consistent one : that it is the Labor members
who have inexplicably broken away from
tradition and argument at the wooing of
the Government charmer ; and probably the
bulk of Labor electors will support it. At pre-
sent, there is a decisive rent in the Labor
party’s garments, and everybody is wondering
how on earth it can be patched up.
A Dreadful State of Things.
It is about time the Sydney importing crowd
who write to the newspapers against Federa-
tion found something newer to say than the old
wheeze that Federation “ will leave New South
Wales at the mercy of the other provinces.”
No doubt if the other provinces combined
against New South Wales in the Federal
Parliament it would be at their mercy. Tas-
mania, Victoria, South Australia, or any other
province, would be also at the mercy of the
rest if they ever made a unanimous combination
against it. Every province is at the mercy of
the rest noiv in exactly the same way ; if all the
other provinces chose to combine against New
South Wales or Victoria they could burn Sydney
or Melbourne to ashes almost any day. Sydney
is at the mercy of the country in like manner ;
if the representatives of the country districts
and the other towns of New South Wales chose
to combine they could pass a law that Sydney
should be destroyed and its site sown with salt
and the capital removed to Wilcannia. Mel-
bourne, in the same way, is at the mercy of
the rest of Victoria, whose politicians
could combine, if they liked, and decree
that the boom-city should be shovelled into
Hobson’s Bay, right down to the last
brick. If Federation is ever accomplished
a combination of politicians might order
Adelaide to be blown up with dynamite at
once, or it might order all the population of
N.S.\V. to be shifted into the Northern Terri-
tory. Every province then will be at the
mercy of the rest (just as it is now) if they
chose to make some impossible combination
against it and order its population to be cooked
and eaten, or something equally horrible. And
in the same way the people of, say, Goulburn
have for the last 50 years been wholly at the
mercy of the rest of N.S.W., and the poli-
ticians from other parts of the province might
enact that the people of Goulburn should be
boiled alive at any moment. This horrible
danger has hung over Goulburn ever since it
first existed, and unless Federation comes along
so that the people of that city can get the pro-
tection of the other provinces it must continue
to do so indefinitely. Also, Moss Yale is quite
at the mercy of the rest of the province, and
bombardment and military execution may be
ordered at any moment. The alarmists who
point out that Federation will place N.S.W. at
the mercy of the other provinces apparently
imagine that they have discovered something
new. When was there a time when every State
or province or county or town in everywhere
wasn’t more or less at the mercy of everybody
else, if everybody else only chose to combine
against it ?

“R.A.F.’' to The Bulletin :
The Q. Govt, desires to “restore confidence”; also, it
wants to encourage the “small capitalist.” And some of
it is sure that the Q.N.B. assets only require to be
judiciously realised/’ and the loss would be small; yet
men acquainted with station property assert that unless
meat and wool increase in value a great deal more than
present circumstances warrant the hope of, none of the
stations foreclosed on, and very few' of those at present in
the hands of nominal owners, would pan out for their
indebtedness if sold as going concerns. The Q. Govt.,
however, could put those properties on the market in a
way impossible to a private institution; let the small
capitalist have his chance, largely benefit the land
revenue, give employment where it is badly needed, and
restore confidence in itself, or at least kindle the hope
that for the future it intended to live cleanly.
A heavily-indebted station means a highly-improved
one. Of course there are a few favored over-drafters
to whom this does not apply, but usually an advanoe
is made for purposes of improvement, and is spent in
conserving water, and in fencing and building. The
demand for grazing farms was, and is, so strong in Queens-
land, and the supply so short, that people who did not
want them for themselves put in for one, much as a ticket
is taken in Tatt’s sweep, sure that if they won in the
ballot a hundred or two would be forthcoming from an
unsuccessful applicant. So great had this evil become
that now, when two or more want the same land, it is put
up to auction and given to the person bidding the highest
annual rental. At present the lessee has to find water,
fence, buy stock, and erect buildings, and he is either
very energetic or very fortunate in his selection if he has
any return to meet rent and other expenses in the first
three years. With stations taken over by Govt, both
selector and Lands Department would be in a much
better position. Farms would be surveyed, so that
existing improvements could' be turned ‘to best ad-
vantage by incoming tenants, stock would be on
the ground at a valuation, station yards and sheds
would be available, and they would have cash re-
turns the first shearing after taking possession. More-
over, Govt, could give better terms than the average
cent.-per-center on the balance of purchase-money, and
it (the Govt.) could proceed to make its own bad debts in
a land-bank of its own if it felt that way, instead of (as
has been suggested) taking over the debts and liabilities
of the Q.N.8., a concern that nobody believes in, and that
tries the fortitude of the Q. Govt, to say it believes in.
To sum up : the Govt, has a million times better show
than anyone else of realising without loss the Q.N.B.
station-properties. The local demand for grazing-farms
is tremendous, many farmers coming from other pro-
vinces only to meet with disappointment. Thu grazing
farmer pays a much heavier rent than the squatter, and
so directly benefits the revenue; he gives employment,
acre for acre, to 10 men for the squatter’s one, and em-
ployment is scarce in Queensland.
Happy is the burnt-oufc householder who didn’t
insure his furniture. Andrew Pontin, a Gee-
long carpenter, was prosecuted last week on a
charge of firing his residence with intent to
defraud the Manchester Assurance Co. There
was practically no sign of his alleged guilt
beyond the fact that after the conflagration he
wanted money from the co. which had guaran-
teed him against fire. The co.’s suspicions
were aroused when Pontin sent in a claim for
compensation, as per contract, whereupon the
police, being instructed to sheet the crime home
to the crafty premium-payer, discovered that
some of his had been removed in a buggy
whilst his house was blazing. It was mainly
on the strength of the buggy incident that
Pontin got dragged into court, and in court the
truth happened to come out. The fire arose
through the curtain of a bedroom - window
getting blown by the wind on to a lighted
candle. Pontin, in pulling down the curtains,
knocked a lamp over and set the whole room
blazing. Then he yelled for the neighbors to
come and help him save his furniture (the house
belonged to somebody else), and he yelled so
loudly that a man came from afar off with a
buggy and put some of the rescued goods
therein. The court discharged Pontin without
a stain on his character. He had committed
nothing but an indiscretion, in having a motive
for arson. The insurance-policy was the motive.
A person who doesn’t take out an insurance-
policy can get all his property destroyed by fire
without the least danger to himself, whereas
the more prudent individual runs a grave risk.

The public lands administration of all the
Australias is bad enough in all conscience, but
for inartistic jobbery and muddlement the
smallest province of the group is easily first.
A year or two since the Bull earth-hunger
seized upon sundry syndicate agents, and nearly
everybody in Tasmania rushed to “go on the
land.” Then the V.D.L. Bank went to pot,
and 55,700 acres were promptly forfeited, and
£16,832 written off the State books as bad
debts. Crown pastoral leases in Tas. are
annually auctioned, and the successful bidder
pays six months rent in advance, then drops
into arrear. At the end of the year his lease
is declared forfeited for nonpayment of rent,
but the gentle squatter comes up smiling
to a new auction and pays another six
months rent for the same old lease which
he has occupied for half a year rent
free ! According to the Lands Department’s
own "report some £5OOO of these arrears of
pastoralists’ rents are annually written off as
irrecoverable. Tasmania appears to be the
happy hunting ground par excellence of the land-
thief and syndicator. Under which circum-
stances it isn’t surprising that the unhappy
island has least to show of all the seven sisters
for her wild carousal on borrowed money,

Opera House Rickards’ Variety Co.
Alexandra Dramatic Co.
Something that isn’t wholly a drama or
distinctly a comedy or altogether a tragedy was
staged at Sydney Cri. last Saturday under the
title of “ A Woman’s Reason.” The beginning of
it suggests the “Ironmaster,” and the middle is
“ East Lynne,” and the end is blessed reconcilia-
tion and a deep resolve on the part of the erring
woman in a cottage to be good in future, and the
return of Rebellious Susan to her home in a better
frame of mind. Yet there are many good points
about this generally conventional play, and it
looks like a piece with a respectably prosperous
future before it. The heroine is the daughter of a
battered and penniless lord, whose estate had
been preserved through stormy centuries by the
family capacity for sticking to the strongest side
when they could identify it, and apologising to
the other side when necessary. But the property
which had been saved by many years of hard
grovel and explanation having gone at last in back-
ing the stiffened horse, the old lord with the dirt-
colored tuft on his chin sells his daughter to a
rich Jew. Seven years later she bolts from her
Jew for no apparent reason save weariness, and
goes astray with a captain. Then she is divorced,
and repents humbly in a brownish frock in a
cottage, where her only distraction is hearing the
ungrammatical servant - girl read the London
.lernil aloud, but the rich Jew offers to take her
backhand they lean up against each other and are
re united, and their small boy’s house of bricks,
which his mother’s skirts capsized as she fled with
her captain, is understood to be reconstructed.
* * * *
The story is only a thin streak of con-
ventionality, but it is adorned with some striking
characters, and several times the two authors
have had to hold each other back firmly by the
coat-tail to prevent them saying something abso-
lutely clever. A certain round, flat-footed, heavy-
breathing man of God, very cleverly played by
Mr. Carey, is an especially beautiful character, and
when he calls with a series of heavy thuds on the
earl’s divorced daughter, and offers to get her into
a home where there are hard beds and repentance
in the form of scrubbing all day long, he is such a
stately and apoplectic parson that the soul of the
audience goes out to him. The truly clerical idea
that scrubbing is synonymous with repentance,
and that the woman who has fallen can only rise
again by fainting gratis at the mangle for ever
afterwards, and being reproved daily by an old
woman kept for the purpose, is an interesting
study. Brough’s lord is among the best of the
many good things this excellent actor has done ;
he is a small, eager, scraggy hustler with the soul-
less eye of one who thinks he has just heard half-
a-crown drop somewhere, and he has the high-
born blastedness of the aristocrat combined
with an anxious slink after portable property
of all kinds. The new man, .Eerris, also pans
out well: Titheradge’s Jew is a fine individual
whose nose doesn’t at all suggest Jerusalem ; and
Mrs. Brough with much ability saves the heroine
from falling flat into the dreary rut of common-
place where the authors have done their best to
plant her; the heroine, as she is written, being
the most conventional character in the play.
The “Woman’s Reason,” so-called because she
hadn’t any, is deserving of support mainly
because of the parson and the lord; the plot is
essentially ordinary and old and tearful, and with-
out these two characters it would probably fall
with a whack that would be distinctly audible as
far as Thargomindah. The Bulletin urges every-
•body to go and see Carey’s worldly parson, and
consider how his large, flat feet pound through
the vineyard, and how his large, damp eye rolls
at the mention of cash, and be tilled with irrever-
ence thereby.
** * *
“Cheer, Boys, Cheer,” which now holds
the * stage at Sydney Royal, is to some extent a
departure from the ordinary groove of melo-drama.
This is in itself a considerable recommendation,
and it has others as well. The plot, by which the
depraved person of the story blasts the nice girl’s
character, is much better constructed than the
average plot; if it was done in real life, and the
matter came into court, Judge Windeyer would
at once say that the evidence was indubitable, and
would lecture the nice girl within an inch of her
life, and then order her to be thrown out with
loathing. The great fighting-scene, without which
no melodrama is complete, is a large and satis-
factory butchery. Everybody is killed, except
two, and of them one is wounded badly, and the
other mortally. A dense smoke drifts slowly
across the little mound of the dead ; and the blood,
and the tattered flag, and the remains of the
National Anthem, and the bush in the back-
ground, and the hair of the wronged girl (who has
arrived suddenly) falling over G. Rignold’s coun-
tenance, all make up a very effective picture.
The fight is preceded by a more than usually
bad attack of British Flag, and the band
of stranded heroes firing its last shots at
the enemy with one hand, and writing a little
note to mother with the other, and singing “ God
Save ” with the other, and waving the grand old
banner with the other, while with the other hand
it gives a final shake of reconcilation to its long-
lost friend, and clutching its gun with both hands
at the same time, is a very effective piece of work,
and one which ought to keep the drama going for
a good while. The method by which all the
important characters are collected together in
South Africa, so that they may be shot and re-
conciled and cleared up and married to each other,
is not more complicated than usual; a Jew, and a
mine, and Plimmer, as a dead-broke speculator
who lives by swindling the aristocracy in Flynn s
office, bring it about in part, and the other part
seems to arise chiefly from Brown.
* * * •
There are a number of good situations in
“ Cheer, Boys,” in addition to the great shooting
episode, and a beautiful flight of marble steps in
the last act, and a certain amount of horse ; and
the dialogue is respectable, and the ultimate down-
fall of the bad woman is great and calamitous.
Thirty-eight people bear the heat and burden of
the scrimmage; twelve of them are distinctly
connected with the story, and the others are
mostly the women who didn’t come _ to Miss
Hughes’s reception in order to mark their disgust
at the nice girl when the cloud of obloquy settled
upon her. Miss Hughes makes her first big suc-
cess in this play, in the character of a tempestuous
lady with a noble heart who makes all the doors
in creation slam furiously as she goes by. Other-
wise the best work is done by Plimmer, Rignold,
Sweeney, and Hans Phillips; and _ the scene
mostly lies either in Matabeleland, or in Barrabas
Buildings, London.

The good old reliable “ Silver King” will
be “ Sinbad’s ” successor at Her Majesty’s, and is
announced for Saturday. The “King” has not
been seen in Sydney for a good while now, and is
quite due for revival. Scot Inglis, reputed, on the
strength of his Melbourne success, to be the best,
as well as the youngest, silver monarch in Aus-
tralia, fills the part of Wilfred Denver, and a very
strong co. has been engaged.

The glory of the Goatcher management at
Sydney Lyceum was of very short duration, and
by the time the remarks in last week’s Bulletin
about the utter cussedness of the show came before
a discriminating public it had flickered out alto-
gether. The Firm for years kept up the Lyceum
as the ultra-fashionable theatre of Sydney, despite
sundry drawbacks about the structure itself, but
when Williamson departed it became immediately
a very ordinary place with no mana worth speak-
ing about. “Lady Blarney” was the first piece
of genuine ill-luck which came upon it, and “True
Irish Hearts ” was the crowning disaster. Two
nights of the funny Irishman dropping the boulder
on Inglis to make sure that he was dead fully
satisfied the current demand for Hibernian humor.
The end of the season came suddenly ; there was
an announcement that the management couldn’t
see its way, &c., &c., and a sound of sudden feet
on the stair, and a door banged, and the co. found
itself dispersing in the street, and the much-
boomed McCarthy frost was finished. Apparently
the Lyceum’s luck is over for a while at least, and
it is now going to scramble for an existence, and
have its transient openings and shuttings, and its
periods of emptiness, and its other periods when
an embarrassed management takes its watch
hurriedly up to the Mont de Piete, like any other
establishment whose mozzle is suspended pending
reconstruction.

Sydney Palace is showing some small signs
of decadence. The name of “ Phil. Goatcher,
lessee,” has disappeared off the advertisements, so
it would seem that that gentleman’s brief and
stormy career of theatrical management has ended
there as well as at the Lyceum. Knowles is in
the bill no longer, though the other notable stars —
Lee, Wilton and Stack, the Delevines and Miss
Antonio—still shed a lustre over the show. Sundry
very well-known variety people who have become
more or less ordinary through long acquaintance
fill the empty spaces more or less.

M‘Mahon’s Cinematographe is adorned
with more new pictures, the best of the lot, and
one of the best up to date, being a view of a
steamer rolling in a troubled estuary, with big
greenish waves wobbling by. It is a thing which
no person addicted to sea-sickness could view with
an easy conscience, and if only a drowned woman
would bob to the surface on a wave-top for a
second or two, and then go under again, the effect
would be complete. The Bulletin recommends
that arrangements be made for including that
suicided woman at once. The Lumi&re “Cin.”
keeps its Melb. Cup pictures still on view in
response to the popular demand for horse, but
sundry new military subjects are thrown in to
vary the monotony of the noble animal.
* * * *
No new people have been turned on lately
at Sydney Tivoli, Chirgwin and Godfrey being
apparently equal to all requirements. The im-
mensity of the popular demand for Chirgwin
grows unaccountable. Judgingby experiences so
far, it seems as if that lonesome Zulu with the
baleful eye could go right on for years to the satis-
faction of the local gods, and despite the fact that
he is very funny sometimes and moderately funny
the rest of the time the furore seems quite as large
as there is any reason for.

The improved edition of “ Matsa ” bounds
along buoyantly at Melb. Princess’s, where a
flashlight photo, of the thirty-second audience
bore witness that the Firm’s gaudy spectacle has
a long future before it. On Saturday night the
Khedive’s variety entertainment was strengthened
by the engagement of R. G. Knowles, who sang
the same old song and wheezed the same vener-
able wheezes as of yore with the same cheerful
appearance of being in a violent hurry all the
time. The suspicion that Knowles’s humor
chiefly consists of violent hurry is a matter
not worth troubling about. In “ Matsa ”
he is merely required to do one tura at
high pressure and retire amidst loud applaus
Knowles fulfills the contract, also his presence
under the circumstances suggests a probability
further additions to the Princess’ panto, from the
source whence he sprang.

“For England,” at-the Royal, doesn t
seem to approach much nearer to its latter end.
Sometimes a horseman accomplishes an art st c
tumble in the hunt-scene, but, as a rule, the whole
field of starters gets through without mishap.
The effect is thrilling in either case. INo hippo-
drama in Bland Holt’s catalogue of past successes
has been quite so perilous as this, therefore boo -
maker Ikey Mo, whose heart naturally jumps lor
ioy when a noble animal comes to grief, is a regu-
lar attendant at the Royal, and a loud chanter of
the show’s praises. It fact, it was a registere
Ikey Mo who first drew attention to the fact that
Walter Baker’s military valor fades into nothing
beside the performances of the unpretentious
warriors, male and female, on them there blanky
’orses. If Baker aforesaid would gladly die for his
sovereign, as he states, he had better exchange
risks with a mounted super., and make his last
will and testament.

This is the last week of “ Miss Brown,” at
the Bijou. Next week, Brough comes along with
his “ Woman of No Importance,” consequently
Melbourne must wait awhile for the promised re-
appearance of Frank Thornton in sundry popular
characters. “ Miss Brown ” has been quite popu-
lar enough for the present season, so that terrible
spinster, together with the major, the hungry
G-erman tutor, the virtuous lady principal, and her
choice collection of girls will descend upon Sydney
with every hope of making a good impression.

The Allisons and Carl Hertz’s ltaest illu-
sion are principal factors in another great boom at
Melb. Opera House. The dancing of the Allisons,
singly or together, is remarkably clever as regards
leg-work, and pretty in sentiment—the best
“turn” of its kind that Rickards has given to
his adopted country. Also, Harry Shine is back
again, almost as good as new, and Charles God-
frey will return for a farewell season on Saturday.
Meantime Coleman, Alice Leamar, Granville, and
Whitburn are appearing as usual, and the glory
of the Opera House bill for next week passeth all
understanding.

At the Alexandra, a hard- working common-
wealth management produced ‘ ‘ After Dark ” on
Saturday. The Bulletin begins to respect
Glover, Wilfred Shine, John Forde, Katie Towers
and the rest of them for their desperate endeavors,
and it hopes—in the time-honored language of
many melodramas —that “ After Dark ” will come
the Dawn. All the same this journal has doots on
the point.

Sad is the old age of the stage in Australia—and pro-
bably everywhere else. Awful will be the latter years of
the Thespian who, when he was young, spent all his
money on drink, cards, velvet collars, Sunday buggies
full of peroxided females, bear’s-grease for his hyacinthine
locks, totes, and other vanities. More than one clever
old actor is in Liverpool (N.S.W.) benevolent asylum ;
another is in the Rookwood poor-house, which thought-
fully provides for the benefit of the old people who have
had to take refuge there a noble view of N.S. Wales’
biggest graveyard—Sydney’s City of the Dead. Then
there are two or three poor old septuagenarians begging
at the street corners, for to-day is the Day of Legs and
their time is past. A benefit for these unhappy old men
wouldn’t draw a cent,
“ Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make
mad.” Which is what the gallery does to a certain kingly
personage. They decline to take him seriously even in
his most tragic moments. And so, cries of “ Nark it,”
“ Leave a bit of her nose, old man,” &c.", are received with
counter blasts of “ Brutes,” “ Cads,” “ it all, can’t
you stop your noise.” The writer has seen Irving, owing
to a gallery riot, ring down the curtain in the middle of
the trial scene, Shylock come forward, calm the noise
by a few adroit sentences, ring up the curtain, and start
the scene again. And the play proceeded to a close with-
out further discord. Verb. sap.
Having determined to stop theatre - overcrowding,
N.S.W. Colonial Secretary Brunker should behave simi-
larly with the churches. On specially holy occasions,
these edifices are crammed full. They are mostly built on
the go-as-you-please plan, and a tour of inspection has
proved to the writer that not more than a dozen Sydney
churches conform to the demand for exits. Temporal
fire, at least, burns the worshipper as well as the scoffer,
and it is surprising that St. Brunker should endeavor to
safeguard only the wicked theatre-goer.
Melb. surgeon Fred. Bird the other day removed from a

Wily R. S. Smythe lately started a newspaper contro-
versy touching a new Shakespearean text interpretation
by Locke Richardson, from which circumstance The Bul-
letin assumes that Smythe thinks of booking that brilliant
reciter for another Australian tour. The controversy in
question would have enthralled the elderly gent sketched
by Dickens in “ Nicholas Nickleby,” who wrote a bulky
pamphlet on the question whether the deceased husband
of Juliet’s nurse was indeed a merry person, as stated by
his relict in the play, or merely a nice man in her connu-
bial opinion. Richardson (with his tongue in his cheek
no doubt) suggested that when Dame Quickly heard Fal-
staff babble of green fields, the dying reprobate was trying
to quote from a certain hackneyed Psalm, and R. S.
Smythe —may Heaven forgive him ! —commends this
. beautiful idea ”to the notice of the Bard’s fervid admirers
in this country. The beautiful idea is, of course, working
its fell purpose among Shakespearean cranks. Some of
them swear by the Psalm theory, others think that the
fat old creature of fiction was babbling about the fields
where he gathered daisies in his childhood, whilst learned
David Blair wades in with another fellow’s doctrine that
Jalstaff s death-bed was covered by “an old-fashioned quilt
formed of lozenge-shaped patches of silk and satin of many
l ' o J ( ’ r ' s ' upon which imitations of the common garden and
wild flowers were neatly embroidered. Falstaff s closing
eyes dmily discerned the flowers and green patches with
which his fingers were fumbling, ancf he very naturally
babbled of green fields. Shakespeare forgot to throw in
any reference to the quilt which David Blair has
pictured for us, but it is satisfactory to know

B iood vindicated The Bulletin
used to think that Dame Quickly was an amiable
perverter of the truth, inasmuch as Falstaff had actually

“no other arrangement will bring Federation

tion movement is a practicable one or not, so that
if it is not it can be dropped, and if it is it can be
brought to a head. . . . In view of the possibilities
of the future, it would be a great thing for the
colonies to have a well-thought-out Constitution
ready for immediate adoption if necessity should
arise.” Aw! Handy little thing to have some-

The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney has
a net profit of £40,066 for the half-year compared with
£40,303 and £39,474 as shown in two previous balance-
sheets. When the 8 per cent, dividend (£40,000) is paid
there consequently remains just £66 to add to previous
balance. The Commercial of Sydney, with its £1,000,000
paid-up capital, £1,010,000 reserve-fund, £2,391,000 coin
on hand and £840,000 of other liquid securities, and its
constantly-increasing business, hardly calls for criticism ;
so far as can be ascertained from its figures it is absolutely
solid and beyond any shadow of suspicion. Therefore the
fact that it nowadays pays away practically all its profits
in dividends is of less account than it would be in the case
of a concern with less solid resources behind it.

A notable revival has lately commenced down
South, and the balance-sheet of the Bank of Victoria, like
most other Melbourne balance-sheets this month, gives
solid evidence of improvement. The half-year’s profits
are £17,928, against £15,068 last half, when the institution
touched low water-mark. A 5 per cent, dividend on
preference shares accounts for £10,419, and the balance,
added to £31,410 previously on hand, makes a credit to
profit and loss of £38,920. The ordinary shareholder gets
no div., and as the profits, after providing 5 per cent, on
preference capital, would only run to 1)4 per cent, at the
best, he will probably have to wait sometime yet, though
his prospects are distinctly better. The upward move-
ment shows itself in every branch of the business. Note
circulation has increased by £29,000 during the half-year;
bills in circulation by £220,000 ; cash and liquid securities
are £236,000 better, cash alone being over £1,000,000,
despite the large repayments lately made in the way of
reconstructed deposits. The Bank of Victoria reckons on
releasing all its reconstructed deposits by some time next
year, and, judging by present appearances, it should be
able to do so without the slightest difficulty.
The Victoria’s is the first bank balance-sheet
issued under the new Vic. company law, and that strin-
gent measure makes it a great deal more distinct than
any previous document of the kind. It sets forth sepa-
rately Government deposits bearing interest and not
bearing interest, and private deposits under the same
two headings ; it sub-divides the liquid assets into eight
distinct items; shows separately bank premises (which
are put in at cost); other real estate (presumably acquired
under foreclosure) and the amount written off the original
cost thereof; advances, less bad and doubtful debts ;
shares; bills discounted; and contingent liabilities on
letters of credit, &c. The Victoria stands this investiga-
tion very well, the amount of “ other real estate” in par-
ticular being comparatively small and put into the
balance-sheet much below cost, and the item, “ shares in
other companies,” covering only £4200; but some other
Vic. balance-sheets, under the same process of dissection,
should be interesting reading. Also the auditors’ certifi-
cate states comprehensively that the sheet is correct —not
“ according to the books,” but with no reservation at all.
One noteworthy feature is that the Bank of Victoria has
still no reserve-fund, and now that things are distinctly
on the mend, a serious effort should certainly be made to
establish one.
* • * *
The first report of the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia under its latest reconstruction scheme is a very
cheering document compared to some which went before
it. Thanks to the large reduction made in the interest on
reconstructed deposits, or thanks partly to that and
partly to a new system of accounts, the net profits are
£41,636, whereas last half there was a loss of £24,054. A
2 per cent, dividend (£21,171) is paid on preference shares,
£29,000 is carried to an “ assets trust special reserve
account ” to provide for losses on the realisation of the
old assets, and the remainder, with £5474 previously on
hand, makes £5940 carried forward. The business of the
new bank, which is now kept separate from that of the old
Commercial, looks large and prosperous. Note circula-
tion has increased £lO,OOO inside six months. Deposits
seem to have also increased, though the new mode of
keeping accounts makes comparison rather difficult; and
liquid assets (£1,654,000, of which £1,207,000 is cash) have
improved by £24,000. The brightest feature in the report
is that, even apart from the saving under the reconstruc-
tion scheme, the Commercial seems to have turned
a corner which looked very unnegotiable a few
months ago. The saving by reduction of in-
terest is about £45,000, whereas the improvement
in net profits, compared with last half-year is appa-
rently over £65,000. Therefore on the figures it
would seem that the institution has rallied, with the
general improvement of things, to the extent of over
£20,000 —or else it has remained about stationary,
or else it has really improved £37,000. There are
so many possibilities about the new system of accounts
that until the next balance-sheet is available for purposes
of comparison it is impossible to be quite sure on these
points. At all events, the situation is that the Commer-
cial, apart from the saving by reduction of interest, which
is a large item in itself, has either become a great deal
better or practically no worse.
The assets of the old Commercial are still more
or less of a mystery. They amount to £5,825,904, which is
original book-value, less inner reserves (amount not
stated), and £40,249 “ balance at credit of special account
in new bank.” Against them are £3,618,148 of old deposits,
£23,852 accrued interest, and the balance of £2,224,153 is
an alleged asset of the new bank. If these figures mean
that the old assets have yielded £40,000 odd to cover
£23,000 interest due to depositors, then the bank’s posi-
tion has improved enormously ; if they mean something
else, then it hasn’t improved quite so much. The long-
expected Companies Act having passed, it is proposed to
write off £1,200,000 of ordinary capital, and to write down
the old bank’s assets by the same amount. Then
surplus profits, after paying the guaranteed 2 per cent,
div. to preference shareholders, will go to provide against
further losses, and as there will still remain £BOO,OOO of
ordinary capital paid up and some £600,000 to come in
which can be written off if necessary, there should be
more than sufficient margin to cover everything. But
considering that the Commercial has only liquidated
£50,000 worth of the old assets in the last six months, it is
evident that they are a very hard lot to realise, and
very unsaleable, and the inference is that a good
proportion are bad, and the rest are mostly of a kind
which have to wait for the revival. As no statement is
definitely issued as to the proportion reasonably supposed
to be good, it may be that the writing off of £1,200,000
will cover the bad ones, or that it is merely the biggest
amount which the board can venture to write off just
now. If the Commercial can keep on as at present build-
ing up a reserve against these assets, it must come out
right some day, but, in the absence of accurate infor-
mation, it is impossible to say exactly when.

The Bank of North Queensland closed its half-
year with a net profit of £l7lB, which is an improvement
on the profits (£1703 and £1182) for the two previous half-
years, especially as premises account is being liberally
written down. Even with this improvement, however,
the amount would barely be equal to a dividend of 1% per
cent., and as this very meagre div. isn’t worth paying,
and there are still possibilities of more depreciation to be
provided for, and something in the way of a reserve is
much needed, the amount is wisely carried forward, and
makes, with previous accumulations, £7365 to credit of
profit and loss. Deposits have increased £3OOO during
the half-year, and the full amount offered (£50,000) of the
new 4J per cent, deposits (which are repayable only at
the option of the bank) has been taken up. It will be
interesting to note how this experiment pans out, though ;
so far, it Beems to be doing well enough. The B.N.Q.
directors reckoned that if ordinary fixed deposits are
taken at, say, 3)4 per cent., and one-quarter is retained
in cash to meet possible withdrawals, the bank only gets
the use of £75 out of every £lOO, while paying interest on
the whole amount, and thus the interest is really £4
13s. 4d. per cent. The interminable deposits require no
cash reserve against them, and may thus be really cheaper
at 4J than ordinary ones at 3J. Still the interest looks
decidedly high and even risky. The B.N.Q. has a reserve
in gold, silver, and State paper of over £87,000, which is
equal to 37 per cent, of all its callable liabilities. This
seems an absurdly high figure, and if the institution put
£20,000 into State securities and thus earned an additional
£6OO to £7OO a year, it might be wise policy. Also, if any
further issue of interminable deposits is proposed it
should be possible, in view of the gradual improvement
m the B.N.Q.’s position, to get the money at 4 per cent.
at least the experiment should be worth trying.
Apropos o f the contention that the State should
“ e ;k i ssue r of paper-money : The circulation of the
B.N Q. at its largest amounted to about £28,000. It was
abolished in ’93 when the Q. Government took over the
local paper-money industry ; yet, at the end of ’96 £309
worth of notes are still unpresented. Only £lB worth
have been presented in the last six months, so it seems
quite probable that £2OO or so will never turn up for
redemption, and will represent the leakage in one small
bank’s circulation inside BJ4 years. And considering how
many banks have a very much larger circulation and
many more years for the leakage to accumulate, there
seems to be a respectable item of revenue here awaiting
State annexation.
* * * •
The Trustees, Executors, and Agency Co.
(Melb.) looks better than it did. Profits for the
six months are £1779 against £1702 and £256 for two
previous periods. A dividend at 5 per cent, absorbs
£l5OO and leaves £279 to carry forward, making the
balance £4514, and the justification for this dividend is
very difficult to find. The co. has £60,000 capital and
£40,000 alleged reserves. But among its assets are £14,000
of preference shares and £lB,OOO of deposits in the Aus-
tralian Deposit and Mortgage Bank, and the operation of
the new Yic. Companies Act drags forth the information
that the whole £32,000 is merely face value. The
£lB,OOO of deposits are worth at present about £13,500 at
the outside. The £14,000 of preference shares are worth
just now not much more than nil. There is obviously
need for a very heavy writing off here, and, until this
item is put on a sound footing, the Trustees,
Executors, and Agency Co. should pay no divi-
dend, or, at least, should not dissipate more
than half its profits in dividends. The whole of the co’s
investments (£62,337) only return interest at a shade over
2 per cent, per annum, and even if the preference shares
—which yield nothing—are left out, the rate is very little
over 2£ per cent, per annum. As the £lB,OOO of deposits
pay 2\ per cent., the Govt, stock pays 4 per cent., and
the shire debentures pay 5 per cent., it certainly looks as
if some of the other investments were not paying at all,
and would also require writing down. Also, the fact that
£62,000 of advances yield £2O less than £59,000 did
last half-year isn’t cheering. One thing at least is
certain: the absurd £32,000 “face value” of Aus-
tralian D. and M. Bank securities wants writing
down to a very low figure; and till this is done the
balance-sheet of the Trustees, Executors and Agency Co.,
though the concern seems to have a large margin over
all possible losses, isn’t a thing to be taken too seriously.
The liquidators of the Colonial Bank of Maori-
land, who are now cleaning up what rags and dust remain
of that unhappy institution after its good business was
taken over by the 8.N.Z., report that things are not look-
ing well with the remains, and that for many years past
the Colonial’s alleged reserve fund of £65,000 “could
have no real existence.” Another evidence for the need
for a State audit. Is there any Australasian bank which
was independently investigated under any circumstances
whatever without the balance-sheet proving a shameful
lie?

Newcastle and Hunter River S.S. Co. shows a
profit of £3106 for the half-year, and a 6 per cent, dividend
accounts for £3OOO of this. The remaining £lO6, added
to the very small previous balance of £5l, leaves £157 to
credit. A year ago the balance was £766, so the co. has
gone backwards considerably, and seeing that it is a con-
cern with £lOO,OOO capital and only £5OO reserves its
position doesn’t look remarkably strong.

The Victorian State Land Bank is issuing its
first £25,000 worth of bonds locally at par, bearing 3 per
cent., and the management is confident that the money
will roll in abundantly. Maoriland got the funds for its
land-bank in London; the interest was 3 per cent., but
the loan only realised about £93 14s. 6d. net. S.A. raised
its land-bank capital at par in Adelaide, but the interest
was 3£. If the Vic. scheme comes off, its land-bank will
make a better start than either of the other two.

At time of writing, although it has been officially
semi-denied and wholly beclouded with hypothetical
possibilities, it appears to be true that 2000 sovereigns
have mysteriously disappeared from a certain bank —from
the head office ; ay, even from that sacred receptacle
called “the treasury.” The report somehow got into the
local newspapers. But all the thrill was successfully
taken out of the sensation by alleging that it is possible
the missing “ two thou.” is an error in book-keeping.
Having stated which, the local papers dropped all refer-
ence to the matter. The latest whisper is that it is
possible that the sovs. might have been overpaid to some
other bank or banks in the “clearing house,” and that
the other banks have been asked to count their gold and
see. The bank’s treasury, by the way, can only be opened
by three officers together, each with a separate key.
Which roundaboutly recalls an Australian
mystery of some years ago. Two officials were work-
ing late at night at the bank. They had balanced their
cash and placed it in the safe. It took their two keys to
unlock (or lock) the safe ; yet, in the morning, £l7OO was
missing. Roughly speaking, the lost money consisted
of 1000 sovs. and 700 in notes. Months afterwards the
missing notes were found beneath a bush, tolerably de-
cayed ; but the sovereigns were never traced. The police
theory naturally was that the robber had been afraid to
negotiate the notes and had buried them successfully.
There is now little doubt that the theft was effected by a
very clever skeleton-key man who died only within the
past three years.
One smart Australian bank-robbery of 23 years
ago was done like t,his(so says a veteran money-changer) :
—“ Most bank-safes in branch establishments are on
wheels, in order that, in case of fire, they may be rushed
out swiftly into safety. Thus, the bottom of the safe is
from sin. to 9in. from the floor. Very well, then. You
and I are balancing-up cash, and have a key a-piece, both
keys being necessary before the safe can be locked or un-
locked. We find the cash right, and it is bagged. I take
the parcel from you, and appear to place it in the bottom
of the safe, whereas I really put it on the floor and push
it swiftly with my foot beneath the safe, the door of which
I close rapidly. I ‘ bustle ’ you that I’m in a hurry to be
off, and we lock and double-lock the safe all right. I
have duplicate keys of the street-door and of the door
leading to the room containing the safe, and I come back
again when all is quiet. Should I be caught, how easy is
it to say ‘Oh, I left my pipe,’ or anything else? I once
knew a man who tried that dodge (in Maoriland), but
the Scotch manager’s eagle-eye ‘ spotted ’ him. The
manager said nothing, but when his assistant was gone
he ‘ lifted ’ the cash himself, ‘ planted ’ it safely, and had
his dear friend arrested for getting into the bank after-
wards. What puzzled the police that time was, ‘ Where
did the man manage to pass over the cash ? He must
have had an accomplice.’ (1!).

Ed. Bulletin, —It is not true that during last
year there was not an ounce of reef gold got within a ten-
mile radius of the Broad Arrow. The Star of Australia,
for instance, crushed 30 tons for an average of over 10oz.,
and the Excelsior, Bardoc, which is being worked by the
prospectors, crushed a lot of stone for an average return
of 30z., and owing to defective machinery there was a
good deal more on the plates ; also the Austrian mine at
Bardoc gave 48oz. for 10 tons stone. There are many
more here and round the Arrow and Smithfield and Pad-
dington that will average 2oz. anyhow. There are few
batteries here as yet, but you’ll find the Arrow Proprie-
tary will give over 2oz. when the clean-up comes.—
Bardoc.
• • • *
“ The old story that the Boulder was floated as
a ‘ cat ’ is set at rest by the manager’s discovery that the
pile of ore at grass at the old prospectors’ shaft, which re-
mained untouched for two years, is worth 3oz. or 4oz. per
ton.” Thus the Kalgoorlie correspondent of the Western
Mail. This, remarks a Bulletin correspondent, is the
sort of thing we are asked to swallow over here. I was
one of the first to peg a lease on Hannan’s, 'when Egan
found the Crcesus. I pegged out on the end of the Croesus
South, and frequently had a look at Brookman’s leases.
The work was then, and for long afterwards, confined to
the reefs ; the existence of the present lode as a gold-bear-
ing concern was unknown, and shares, which are an in-
fallible proof as to the value set upon a claim by the holders,
could be had at a song—in fact, as is well-known, they
simply weren’t marketable long after the property was
floated.
“Here,” continues the writer, “is another
item. ‘ It is understood that with regard to the recent re-
ported find of telluride ore in the N. Boulder that the
manager admits striking stone worth about 500 oz. per
ton.’ Why don’t the Kalgoorlie people let Londonderry-
like gabble slide, and allow their crushings to talk ?
These latter are good enough in themselves to boom the
field.”

Hannan’s True Blue Co., Ltd., should add the
word “Duck” to its title. It started well with a large
fat capital of £125,000, from which the vendors filled their
pockets and black bags with 93,400 fully-paids. The
working capital was £30,000. Five samples of stone gave
90oz. to the ton of prospectus, according to an expert’s
report. Another expert estimated “ the value of the ore
at soz. per ton from all parts of the mine.” In London
Financial Times a shareholder writes to say the Hannan’s
True Blue (Duck) “ has been a great disappointment to
the shareholders, and the prospects look very poor.” He
also remarked that the four directors drew £lOOO in fees
for the first year, and in view of the poor outlook ,he
thinks £5OO ample for the second year. Three-and-six a
sitting would be over-payment of any London director,
and then the sittings should be monthly.

W.A. Goldfields Water-Supply sickens. Ap-
proximately in hand, £lO,OOO, but if the co. falls across
any more snags like the Bayley’s Consols contract it won’t
have that long. Six months’ water-sales to October,
£2247, to earn which the co. spent £6324. £3OOO went in
one swoop over water bought from the aforesaid Consols,
the bulk evaporating before the co. could find a market.
Evidently the water-supply is another dead-horse creation
of the W.A. boom, and a mighty summer and a sizzling
thirst will have to seize Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie to help
the co. off the rocks. The concern seems principally Job-
son, who draws £l5OO a year, but Jobson doesn’t appear
to figure anywhere in the balance-sheet. Why ? Or have
they stowed the small man away as a sundry creditor ?

will the crowd mill first ? As the co. isn’t feeling too well
financially, and moreover as one heavy holding director
is anxious to lighten his load, the betting favors the soz.
dump. Should Margarets see £4 the scramble to unload
will be an inspiriting sight to those who are not buying.

A strike at the Hit or Miss mine (W.A.) against
a reduction of wages. Well, from all the writer heara of
this mine, no wonder an attempt to reduce wages is made.
If the co. is sympathised with, then at ss. a week a miner
would be overpaid for working in the mine. If, on the
other hand, the miner is to get the sympathy, £5 a week
would not recompense him for working in so poor a show.
The manager, a well-known Bendigo man of the highest
credentials, lately resigned—he could not stand it. A few
days after he left a statement was issued in London declar-
ing that the failure was due to mismanagement, that the
mine was likely to turn out very valuable, as there was
20,000 tons in sight. This has every appearance of being a
lie. The manager was good enough for the big mines of Ben-
digo, and has the choice of half-a-dozen mines to manage
now. The old game —“ mine no good, blame the manager.”
Why is it that the last two big-tonnage crushings from
this mine have not been recorded in the usual 'quarters ?
Their average of less than 4dwt. to the ton is one reason.
The mine as it stands appears to be completely exhausted
of every ton of payable stone ; the future depends upon
striking new rich ore-streaks, such as those on which it
was sold for an awful price ; the ore in sight only assays
6dwt. The manager will defend his reputation, and is
determined that the deluded British shareholders shall
know the whole truth.

Some consternation was caused last week on the

sioned probably by phrases in the manager’s last report.

At Norseman, The Bulletin hears, things

Cause and effect. The Lady Brassey, an alleged

This is the season when the Australian
Goyernors more or less quarter themselves and
their belongings on poor old Lord Gormanston. The
Bulletin is sorry for H.E. Before he accepted
the Governorship of the Isle of Sleep a Lot the
local authorities reduced the vice-regal salary to
<£2500 a year in all, on which H.E. has to main-
tain Govt. House. He distinctly bargained, in
accepting the salary named, that he was not to be
expected to entertain or to subscribe to public ob-
jects, but, all the same, he does entertain, more
or less, and when he refuses, as per contract, to
head subscription-lists, his subjects utter snorts of
scorn and derision. The Tasmanians don’t even
allow their Governor uncustomed liquor as is the
vogue on the Australian mainland. If The Bul-
letin were Governor of Tasmania under present
conditions it would have a large signboard
erected at Hobart Government House gates bear-
ing conspicuously the inscription : “Boarding-
House for Governors. Terms will be supplied
by the private secretary.”

upon the trustworthiness of the evidence and the
manner in which the police do their duty.
Alleged result : the territorial police bringing a
case before the metropolitan P.M. are uncon-
sciously favored by him, while the city policeman
has to prove his case right up to the maker’s name.
Whatever the actual result, the trouble looks like
a shadow of the “ System,” and badly wants some-
thing done to it.

A recent horse acci-
dent in King-street,
Sydney, attributed to
the sudden emergence
of a barrister’s grey wig
and flying gown, has
caused several people to
think out ways of pre-
venting such trouble in
future. The best way,
of course, is to abolish
wig and gown—though
even then some barris-
ters’ faces would scare
timid horses. The next
best way is to make the
men put on and take off
the properties within the
precincts of the court.
Several accidents have
happened in London by
reason of robed barristers
crossing from the Temple
to the Law Courts ; but
some time ago the County
Council took the trouble
in hand and cut an
underground tunnel be-
tween the two points
for the use of the scare-
ful apparitions.

A Sydney man of

to the halt, the lame,
and the blind, at 6s. per
day ; and has in his em-
ployment a few men and
boys as regular hands, to
whom he pays a pound
and 15s. a week respec-
tively. The latter, of
course, have to make a
satisfactory return to
justify their wages.

Queensland Government is putting up
£ 1500 to bring back 60 saddened Bananalanders
from Don Lane’s paradise in Paraguay. Forty
out of the 60 are children. One stranded pilgrim
has a wife and 11 offspring, which is a pretty large
encumbrance for a man to procesh with while he
goes round asking for work in a strange language
and in a land where the wages are next to nothing
paid in depreciated paper. A homeless mate with
11 children hustling for a job on a foreign strand,
where he is vaguely known as Don Smith, from
Australia, is the very incarnation of pathos.

The confession of Phillips, who says that
he shot Brady, the recently-butchered Melbourne
bookkeeper, and then cut his throat with a dinner-
knife taken hurriedly out of the stock, and left
him dead in the warehouse, is an incongruous sort
of tale. Phillips, who was a weedy youth at a
microscopic salary, alleges that Brady, who had a
strong regard for the fair sex, led him into evil
habits, and he began to dissipate wildly on his 10s.
a week, and learned to go round every night with
the multitudinous Flossie. His wild extravagance
in this direction landed him in such embarrass-
ments that in the course of five years he became
.£1 short in his cash, and Brady harassed him
about this matter till the trouble ended in murder.
Brady himself had a salary of £4 10s. a week, so
it would seem that two men can have a great deal
. of wassail in Melbourne with £5 a week between
them, eked out by 20s. embezzled in instalments
spread over several years. The 205., Phillips says,
was mostly taken to buy an occasional clean collar
with which to meet the Flossie of the moment at
some street-corner. Therefore, it appears that if
he had been trained to wear a celluloid collar,
which can be washed at the sink, the tragedy
would never have happened.
The so-called confession teems with hysterical
references to “ successes with women ” ; this con-
tinual reiteration suggests a degenerate strain in
Phillips, for, purporting to be a repentant con-
fession of shame, it is, on the other hand, a
strongly-branded exhibition of diseased vanity
and self-conceit. Men who write showy confes-
sions of the kind are usually innate liars. A per-
fectly beautiful example bearing on which dogma
can be seen in a celebrated N S.W. confession of
a year or so ago.
The limelight document in question hardly
looks as if it was entirely written by Phillips him-
self, but seems to have been compiled by another
person from a story told him. And said story
would appear to have been subjected—however
unconsciously— to an amount of ornamentation and
doubtful interpretation. The present written
document is just such as to excite a diseased glori-
ficatory joy in a degenerate mind.
The Phillips confession is indeed a clumsy docu-
ment, and tends to show that a murderer should
neither edit his confessions himself nor let his
lawyer do it; but turn the job over to some smart
newspaper man, accustomed to calculating the
of written words upon the public mind.
When I first went to Cooper’s office I was a
bright, happy intelligent boy,” & c . What a
hideous png the confession makes out Brady’s
siayer to have been ? Little things like that dis-
gust the ordinary mortal, and often have more to
do with getting a man hanged than the actual
capital crime alleged against him.

A point worth noting in the Melbourne
murder-case. Young Phillips, the confessor is

name begins with Fink, and prosecuted by a Crown

called to this point by the somewhat extraordinary

“ What! Jones ! the boss ! Oh, no, he’s reckoned

“He doesn’t know! This branch is run by

“ Oh, no !” (and slightly blazed that stolid store-
man)
“ The boss is white! —but we've a damn bad fore-

And as I left, the earth-den rose in sight,
Its hosts of men and women slaving bravely,
And came the larger question still more gravely :
“ Does God—the great God—know how hard they
fight ?
Or some cat-hearted Deity—like Wright,
Unwatched—take from their sorrows wild de-
light ? ”
“ That’s so ” (some voice came echoing the store-
man),

do any harm, but I am starving and must get food.
If you don’t lock me up I’ll break that plate-glass
window with this stone.” Then the man’s case
would excite real compassion ; whereas by doing great

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Jan. 26, 1897.
My Dear Myee—
At the Vie. v. N.S.W. cricket-match on Satur-
day the most exciting scene of the afternoon was
the gallant attempt of Premier Reid to get a cup
of tea for Lady Hampden in the crowded tea-room
behind the new stand. Her Ex. was a model of
plain-dressing in black, and her escort was wear-
ing his_ auburn hair rather long; also, his Lorne
excursions had made him thinner. As every
woman on the stand seemed to want a cup of tea
at the same time as every other woman, and the
waitresses were few, wild confusion raged in the
cafe all the time. Cricket is a slow game to watch
when you don’t understand it. I heard one lady
explaining to another that the banked asphalt
cycling-track around the ground was made so that
balls thrown to the fence would roll back easily,
which made her apparent interest a little bewilder-
ing. On the whole, I agree with the indignant
Frenchman who sat out a match, had intricacies
explained, and rose impatiently, saying: “Bah
for your crickets. I mock myself at ’eem.”
A reception was held on Saturday evening on
board the huge German liner, Friedrich der
Grosse, on which several hundred guests held high
German jinks 60ft. above sea-level. To reach the
deck was like climbing a high mountain, and to
descend to the ladies’ cloak-room one plunged into
a long submarine street of state-rooms. There
is a vast quantity of gilding and splendor about
the whole ship, especially the ladies’ saloon, all
upholstered in brocade and adorned with scenes
from the life of the forbidding-eyed Fritz. Here
the wife of the agent, clad in pale blue, some
officers and uniformed foreigners, were standing
as hosts and nodding to as many as could get near
them. There was no name-shouting, and guests
found their way about the ship from explanatory
German remarks made by stewards. The Fried-
rich seems a beautiful ship to get lost in at sea ;
there are so many nooks and corners that the per-
centage of engagements ought to rank very high
each voyage.
The entertainment chiefly consisted of a band
and supper suggestive of the Fatherland. The
dishes were all invented in Germany and unex-
pectedly flavored with sauerkraut. I saw a girl
eating herring-salad with a puzzled expression
alternately with a piece of sweet cake. The gory-
looking dish was in great demand. The whole
company was determined to find out what Ger-
man cookery really is, and took egg-salad with
cheese-sandwich and lager-bier with everything.
There were thousands of brass-buttons and miles
of gold lace and many lobster coats glittering
around, so the men had it all their own way in
splendor. Some of the women neglected the
evening-dress command and kept on wraps. The
electric-light was very brilliant and glared merci-
lessly on all complexion-defects, even showing up
where the real hair left off and the false fringe
began.
The sightseers who rushed to see the German
jumbo, tied up to the Circular Quay on her arrival,
were more than pleased when a plump frau ad-
vanced to the bulwarks of an upper deck, dozens
of feet directly over their heads, and, while she
gazed curiously at the throng beneath her, dis-
closed to their delighted eyes a generous glimpse
of zebra-marked hose ! When an admiring “ Oh-
o-o-o-o ! ” rose from the assembled youths, the fair
immigrant leaned still further over the side, to
learn the cause of the mirth below—making
astounding revelations —whereupon another pro-
longed or more hilarious “ Oh-o-o-o-o ! ” greeted
the exhibition. The lady’s composure was serene;
but just here the awful truth burst upon her
phlegmatic spouse, and Herr Mein Gott made a
grab at the bewildered foreigner and hauled her
below.
An elderly dame was much scandalised, one
evening last week, on seeing a Jin de siecle couple
arrive, per wheel, at a fashionable cemetery.
Placing their machines against the door of a
family vault (for safety), they proceeded to the
grave of some dear departed (possibly the man’s
first wife), stood beside it for a decent space, with
lowered head and much wiping of weeping eyes—
remounted their bikes, and scorched back to
town 1
At the Palace of Varieties, the Winterton
sisters now come on in fresh-looking short skirts
of green silk all sprinkled over with pink starfish ;
the three Dele vines in the same turn are dressed d
la chappie with crushed hats, black knee-breeches,
and a cunning little white ribbon tied under the
left knee. The two girls wear a black ribbon in
the same place occasionally, revealed as they whirl
their skirts. The d.c. audience made a noble
effort at first to dress up to its surroundings, but
has given up the struggle, and now wanders in
each evening casually in the übiquitous blouse-
and-skirt, and the men just anyhow.
At a fashionable mountain resort last week a
local leader gave a picnic, for which large paste-
board invitations had been sent out for a week or
two. Every Nicest person invited turned up
expecting sylvan joy and great effects in catering.
But the gilt edge was completely rubbed off the
party when it was found to consist of a score of
fly-maddened revellers wrestling with extra-sized
mosquitoes in the interval of excitedly jumping up
from prowling bull-ants, and, for refreshments,
drinking tea out of pannikins and wrapping them-
selves around day-before-yesterday tarts and buns.
“A Woman’s Reason,” at the Criterion, con-
tains some pretty gowns and a satisfactory child
curled in the manner of such on the boards, but
natural and unaffected. A white Court dress with
plumes and regulation train makes Mrs. Brough,
as Nina, look young enough to wear that trying
tint by daylight. The real thing, as a matter of
fact, is quite ghastly and shuddery. Unclothed
white humanity under the cold gleam of a London
spring sun turns yellow and bony, and daylight
on evening-cut and tinsel makes 18 look 80. Nina
has also a blushing pink robe prettily swathed
about the bodice with black chiffon and gleaming
bands of jewelled gimp, and a tiny butterfly
bonnet. Hints as to sleeve-retrenchment may be
gained from the gowns ; they are all diminished
and flattened, and generally put down from the
high place they have held until lately on all the
robes ; in ball-dresses one wears arms au naturel,
with a bow on each shoulder and a bunch of frilly-
stuff half way down to the elbow. In day-frocks
there is a new stiffiness which gives a funnel-like
curve over each shoulder.
Many representatives of the noble army of
nodders were each filling his or her little seat at
the Criterion last Monday, which is a good night
to take the inquiring stranger to a city show and
point him out all the celebrities. A cultured
g;rson in the back-row brought in a decadent
odley-Head volume and read it absorbedly
between the acts. A bright-haired critic beamed
with interest on the palatially-arranged and
gorgeously-furnished mansion of the Ti'tberadge
manage. The porphyry columns are very real, but
I don’t quite grasp the why and wherefore of a
gilt-edged, plush-mounted nursery fireguard in a
millionaire’s best parlor.
On a crowded Sunday evening trip of a Manly
ferry-boat, a highly-dignified churchman was re-
turning to town after some special service. Near
him were sitting four elements of a real, thriving,
lively “push,” wh > beguiled the journey with
song, and their gi.ls clutched them round the
neck and joined shrilly in the chorus. The digni-
tary looked pained, and would have passed over
on the other side, only there the man with the
good voice was warbling “ Life’s Dream is O’er,”
with harmonious accompaniments. To hearken
to that sentimental lay, and then wonder hard
what on earth the words mean, puts in the time
nicely on a Manly trip. The churchman must
have noticed that everybody seemed to enjoy
comic songs more than hymns, and probably put
that down to the cussedness of human nature.
The feature of the fashionable Bong-Bong races
was a monkey. It belonged to a professional
“ spieler ” who had come to turn an honest penny,
which he did by getting up £1 raffles —ten shares
at two shillings each. The drawing of the lottery
was entrusted to the monkey, and the promoter
took the moderate commission of 20 per cent.
This little gamble became quite the rage and pro-
vided an excitement sadly lacking in the races
which formed the ostensible reason of the gather-
ing. The police, noticing the extent of the monkey-
proprietor's operations—he put through about .£OOO
m the two days—-were about to remove him from
the course, but when they beheld a live Governor
and a live Supreme Court Judge backing their
luck at the simian’s altar, they sensibly concluded
that in all probability the monkey and his box
and table didn’t constitute a “ place ” within the
meaning of the Act, and became deaf and blind
accordingly.
Take away the mother-in-law and the drunken
husband and the scolding wife and the undesired
twins, and the so-called comic-song collapses.
But sometimes a really great comic-song is born,
and the way it catches on shows that these
ditties “ fill a long-felt want. ” It must have some
real, permanent quality easily recognised, like the
splendid insolence of “ The Man that Broke the
Bank,” or the frank confession of being “bad”
that there is in the “Trinity Church,” or the
cynical pessimism of most of Coleman’s songs.
The newest comic-songs are grimly ironical, quite
unlike the vulgar riotousness of “Champagne
Charley,” for instance; most of them are in a
minor—there is a beautifully mournful phrase at
the beginning of “ I ain’t a-going to tell, the sort
of thing Marshall Hall would rave about were it
in a symphony. Comic-songs are the hymns of
Democracy. They voice the sordid, squalid troubles
of life, and the people listening recognise that the
singer is a man who doesn’t pretend to be any
better than they are —and applaud him in conse-
quence.
What a help a uniform is ! “Major ” Neild in
London was present at the distribution of prizes
for shooting, presented to the Tower Hamlets
rifles, and arrayed in his almost brand-new mili-
tary millinery, “ responded to an invitation,” and
addressed the assemblage. As plain “ Mr.”
Neild in a top-hat, frock-coat, and spats, he would
have been nothing, but an inch of cotton-wool
padding all around the inside of a scarlet coat—
an inch of cotton-wool padding is actually pre-
scribed in some cases by the N.S.W. military
regulations—gives courage as well as chest. That
tight, pincushiony effect is not attained by un-
assisted figure anymore than the artificially-fatted
stage calf. The row in Sydney just now about
the appointment as commanding officer is built on
the unquenchable desire of man for more uniform
and more chest-padding. The big struggle is who
shall wear the tin hat and feathers.
Nuns will consent to wear unbecoming uniforms
—but they are R.C. nuns. Pastor Edgar started
a Wesleyan sisterhood in Melb., and they have
quite lately doffed their cowls and taken to neat
felt hats. A feather or two will be added in time,
no doubt. Protestant sisterhoods always manage
to get something of the world into their attire,
and as they walk through the giddy, Binful throng
occasionally cast a glance of interest to see what is
going on in the male world. Shades of cloister
don’t fall on them so heavily as on the old, original
brand of brides of the church.
Girls who serve out food and drink to their
fellow man and woman for hire are divided into
three classes —“ladies,” “lydies,” and “ puffeck
lydies.” The new tea-room girl is always a
“ lady,” and therefore resents a movement being
forced on by the Brisbane (Q.) Worker to form
her into a union. The biz. is a superior sort of
bar-tending—barmaids are “ puffeck lydies ” —and
suits most of the damsels who deftly carry their
trays and a mild flirtation with favored men-
customers, most of whom are their partners at
swagger balls and “at homes ”in theevenings. Some
serve in tea-rooms for filthy lucre because papa
went bung during the depression, and many to
escape the dreary dullness of suburban respect-
ability. Most of the waitresses at the new cafe at
Sydney Cricket Ground are girls culled from
among Nice families.
The ’bus horses have been getting a friend to
agitate their wrongs in the daily papers. No
wonder ! It is horrible to see three poor, straining
animals tugging a tremendous load of fat men and
women up William-street hill under the lash. A
driver complains bitterly that it is the women who
make it still harder for the horses by stopping the
’bus every four or five yards to get m or out.
Even cable gripmen jib at pulling up every few
inches. One of them, I overheard, on seeing a
tenth parasol in one block waved at him, mutter :
“ Blest if they don’t want me to stop at every
house.”
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“The best-appointed dog-cart to be seen around
Melbourne is driven by the bachelor agent for
somebody’s soap, whose matrimonial attractions
have grown stronger than ever now that the other
handsome soap potentate, Mr. Francis I orrest, is
engaged to the youngest daughter of Tasmanian
Treasurer Fysh. Some two hundred spinsters,
calculating roughly, were on the lorrest track
until the news of his impending doom turned their
four hundred tearful eyes upon the Apollo in the
dog-cart. The competition for this obdurate sur-
vivor threatens to result in bloodshed. A small
army of girls may be expected to fall fainting
under his chariot-wheels at any moment if he
doesn’t give them a little encouragement, to go on
with. A hair apiece from the horse s tail would
be better than nothing.
“Mrs. Silas Harding, the .£30,000 a year
widow, will be missed by a number of needy out-
siders, as well as by sundry relatives of the late
Silas whom she has helped from the old man’s
money-bags, for if the unlucky lady died intestate,
as is understood, the miser’s leavings will revert
to her next of kin. A generally-received story
has it that Mrs. Harding captured her husband
whilst canvassing subscribers to a book, but the
truth is she made her famous haul in the capacity
of an attendant in one of the foreign courts of the
Melb. exhibition. Her charms, enhanced by a
fancy costume, were too much for the susceptible
widower, notwithstanding that she had an “ off ”
eye and suspiciously golden hair. Perhaps the
yellow tresses twined themselves round his heart!
Gold !
“Miss Muriel Bevan (daughter of the cherubic
Melbourne shepherd), w’ho went to Europe to
study music, expresses herself in good round terms
of dislike for Germany and the Deutschers. She is
disgusted with the manner iu which the men treat
their womankind. Miss Bevan will not stay in
the Faderland, anyhow, and unless she decides to
continue her studies in England she will return to
Melb. with her parents later in the year.
“ Dr. Neild, the Melbourne deputy city coroner,
and the old spoilt darling of the Austral Salon,
thinks seriously of writing an auto-biography.
The clever veteran has heaps of material for a
lively work, and if he only had the toughness
necessary to keep himself secluded from his bevy
of Salonites the volume might struggle into exist-
ence.
“Lady Brassey having raked in piles of cash
for the Blind Asylum, Mrs. Baronet Clarke now
starts to show that she also can lead charity on a
string by booming an Infectious Diseases Hospital.
As a matter of fact, she started the idea before
Lady Brassey made her bid for popularity at the
public expense, but the wife of the yachting
Governor, knowing a move or two, took the wind
out of her sails. Now the perky, plucky
bart.’s spouse bucks up and whips hard for sub-
scriptions for her idea. She’ll get ’em.
“ Antarctic-explorer Borchegrevink’s wife is the
ideal of what an explorer’s spouse ought to look
like. She is very tall and fair, with strong but
pretty features. She “ did ” Melbourne in about
three strides, clad (she, not the strides) in a silver-
grey travelling dress, with loose jacket, and a
jaunty, grey Alpine hat with a cock’s-feather in
it, and a pair of opera-glasses slung round her
shoulders. If her husband goes to find the South
Pole, she waits for him in Melbourne.
Yours affectionately, Cleo.
Eureka Creek (N.Q.) has furnished, in the
late David Alexander, a throw-back to the species
of miner whose favorite method of suicide was to
lay a dynamite plug on his tongue, light the
fuse, and await the seconds grimly until the top
of his head exploded.
Ellice group fishers, says Mr. Hedley, of
the Australian museum, have an ingenious and
successful bait—a mixture of cuttlefish ink and
European scent (or, in default of scent, kerosene)
painted over the hook. The little patch of dis-
colored water round it tricks the fish into the
notion that the hook is some diminutive succulent
squid.
Since the Federal question became the
immediate topic of the hour, every Sydney daily
paper has poured cold water on it more or less, the
Evening News alone excepted. In its leader of
January 25 the News lays down its views—which
are that the various provinces, despite local
rivalries, are Australian at heart or will learn to
be; that they can afford to trust each other ; that
there is no need for haggling over “guarantees”
to prevent them forming combinations to rob and
murder one another by the wayside; and that
when they are combined under a uniform system
all the various cities can hold their own well
enough by their own merits. Which is a dis-
tinctly sensible and practical idea. If Australia
can’t find trade and industries enough at all times
to keep five cities going then it is the poorest con-
tinent in this globe.
Another body, said to be that of one
Burgess, has been unearthed near Parkes (N.S. W.)
and it is also set down to the comprehensive Glen-
brook criminal. Two other men, said to have
been last seen in the company of that übiquitous
undertaker, are being searched for, and reports
continue to come in concerning persons who went
away with a mysterious prospector at various
tnnesand places, and have never since been heard
of. Ihe latest find had the usual bullet-wound at
the back of the head; apparently he had been,
like the others, delving at the hole which was to
be his grave, when his “ mate ” shot him from the
rear and then he dropped in and was covered over
m the usual way. No wonder this year’s wheat-
crop promises well in N.S. W.; the dead mate is a
wonderful fertiliser.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The VRC is this week considering the matter
of a regulation to secure the payment of jockeys'riding-
fees at scale. “Recent disclosures, says Melb. Age,
“show that the winners of some of the chief races on the
Vic turf have for a long time been unpaid their fees, and
it is well known that several jockeys have been put off
from time to time by their easy-going employers, despite
that the victory of their horses had enabled them to pay
the jockey liberally. There is more in the proposal, as it
affects the honesty of the turf than at first meets the
eye.” The Age might as well have mentioned that the
first “ recent disclosure ” ever published on this stinkful
subject was published in these columns ; also it was pub-
lished apropos to the “honesty (or dishonesty) of the
turf” in such a way that no eye which met it could help
perceivin'" the point. The Bulletin of Nov. 7, 1896, said
in “ Plain'English “ As for the true reason why cronk
runnin" is so general—viz., the inability of jockey-boys to
get the price of their riding-fees from anybody except
bookmakers, who will pay them to lose it is never even
hinted at in turfv columns. Many jockeys would starve
if they were confined to their legitimate professional
earnings seeing that their impecunious employers (nomi-
nal employers) don’t pay them anything for months at a
stretch. And, by the way, the V.R.O. might have the
candor to record on the minutes of Monday s committee
meeting the fact that the new rule re. jockeys' fees was
inspired, or at least hastened, by the brutal revelations of
a “ scurrilous Sydney newspaper.” Anyway, The Bulle-
tin will be glad to receive the blessing of a few grateful
jockey-boys. * * *
The Y.A.T.O. stewards, t’other Saturday, found
our old, young friend, Jimmy Hayes, guilty of “ malprac-
tices ” in connection with the running of two-year-old
Key, and disqualified him for four months. An unsatis-
factory word, as far as punters are concerned, but very
characteristic of racing government. “ Malpractices ”
presumably means something which the authorities know
of, but ain’t agoin’ to tell to the public.
Also, the ending of the Patricia scandal is rather
unsatisfactory. The V.R.O. have gone no further than
the excommunication of “ a well-known backer,” as though
the man in question were acting solely as agent for
himself in the bribery-and-corruption business. If he
played a lone hand in squaring the jockey and lessee of
the mare, and was simply clearing the way for another
animal that hehad backed, how came Patricia to retire from
even money to 10 to 1 in the betting? The policy of the
backer, the jockey, and the other man, under those circs.,
would have been to preserve the Patricia secret, keeping
the dead ’un favorite whilst the backer secured long odds
about his “ fancy.” Clearly the briber was working in co.
with one or more bookmakers, backing one candidate (if
he did back it) with the money milked from Patricia.

That good but unlucky horse, Pharamond, has
been sent from Sydney to Tas. to run for Hobart Cup
next week, and, "if he be capable of beating his com-
patriot, Honiton, he should about win. Though the dis-
tance is rather far for him, he has only to meet “moder-
ates.”

Sep. Miller’s most consistent and unlucky mare,
Ripple, got placed for just about the twentieth time with-
out winning on Saturday.

N.Q. racing clubs (and the southern Q.T.C.
talks of following their example) have prohibited Ikey
Mo from droning his nasal chant on their racecourses.
First consequence : a dozen or so crack racers have
bidden the North an eternal good-bye. Will it strangle
gambling in the North ? Bah ?—will it abolish leprosy,
smallpox, Kanakas, tatnbaroora, Yokohama, sexuality and
Northern sin ?

At all Yic. suburban pony meetings all the
ponies have to return to the trainers’ enclosure after their
preliminary canters. It is only after the final instructions
then given to the jockeys whether to gee or not that
heavy money goes on. Which proves that the man who
backs a pony when the betting opens is more than a fool,
and is bound to get broke.

The two heavy Victorian winners over Quiver’s
alleged victory in the Viceroy’s Cup drew their money
the day after the Melbourne papers reported the false
result, and—such is luck 1—sailed for ’Ome a day later.
There was great joy in Jerusalem when the bookies had
also to part up on the real winner later on.
* * * •
Mr. Sam Hordern does not certainly bid for
favor with the racing public, whatever he may do in other
lines of business or sport. Last year in Challenge Stakes
the publio fancy, Cravat, was scratched at the last
moment, and now in the same race last Saturday similar
tactics were pursued re Miss Norah, who was the pick of
the public and a great favorite. The Skipper episode has
not been forgotten, so no wonder that the “ white and
blue spots ” are at present rather at a discount.
* * • •
A despised outsider in Talavera won the Chal-
lenge Stakes at S.T.C. Anniversary meeting at Rand-
wick, whilst a filly that has been running in selling
plates secured second money. The heavily-backed ones
finished “down the course,” much to the delight of Ikey,
who had a most successful day.
* • * •
At ’Ome they are not now taking any imported
Musket sires. Mr. S. Hordern’s Carbonado (Hotchkiss —
Onyx) recently fetched at auction but 40gs., which
wouldn’t pay his passage-money. Which should put an
end to the haphazard exportation of blood stock.
* * * *
Punters have had a very bad time of it lately in
N.S.W. Following close on the late scratchings of Cart-
ridge come the eliminations of Aurea, Wolluinumbi, and
Miss Norah from Challenge Stakes ; each having in turn
reigned as first favorite. Ante post-betting will soon be
killed at this rate.

. Champion ’Stralian chaser Daimio is [undergo-
ing a good preparation for Liverpool Grand National
Steeplechase, and if he safely negotiates the awkward
brooks he should have a good chance of winning the
cross-country blue riband the first time of asking. Two
other Stralians, in Ebor and Norton, will also compete,
but they will find the distance rather too far.
* * * *
. P e °pie are very tired of the overland-cycle-
journey record—of, for instance, hearing how “ Snell had
a head wind all the way,” and how after “ taking a hath
and refreshments,” he resumed his trip ; also that it w'as
• n iV “ 1S ’Rendon to take any rest whatever.” That’s all
right, but Snell and Co. might give the poor public a rest.

Justice and Chief-Justice —Simpson and
Barley—date their exacerbation of temper in each

A Queensland bishop regularly travels in a

Mrs. Silas Harding was buried in Melb.
cemetery, and will have a monument “on her

wife at Geelong, so when the two ladies meet on
the Awful Day they will require a formal intro-

Anthony Forster, whose death is cabled,
was once editor and part-proprietor of S.A.
Register. He was M. P. for West Adelaide in
the ’Sixties, and one of Torrens’ best supporters
in his land-transfer reforms. Like Medway Day,
in later years, he was the Radical editor of a paper
owned by deep-dyed Tories. Wrote a history of
S.A., and only had one fault —a small vol. of
poems.
Q. Premier Nelson is locally dubbed
“ Nevermind ” Nelson, as a tribute to his fixed
profession that “nothing matters.” Next to
Tozer, Nelson is the easiest-going promiser and
the laxest performer of all the Q. Ministry. He
breathes a whiskyfied forgetfulness, and his capa-
city to sleep on undisturbed in a rowdy Assembly
has more than once provoked the jibes of Labor-
members.
Premier Turner is determined to stop civil
servants from writing for the press. In private
conversation, it was put to him that there might
be a man in the service with a special talent for
writing—a poet, for instance. “Well,” said
Turner (who never reads poetry or any such stuff),
“if he is so good at writing poetry, let him go
outside and earn his living at it, not take a salary
from the State while competing with outside
poets.” Turner evidently regards writing poetry
as something akin to growing cauliflowers or
fattening ducks.

Pastor Bevan is off to Jerusalem. A bad

The American Referee refers to sock-

The late George Harris, of Ultimo House,
Sydney, was the eldest of the rich family of that
name, and occupied, it is said, a peculiar position
with regard to the estate. He was a witness to
us father’s will, a circumstance which debarred
him from any legal share in his father’s bequest
±Sut the circumstance was not allowed to operate
against him, as the other members of the family
gave him an equal share.
Bishop Saum a r e z
Smith was referred to as
the “Primate” when visit-
ing a fussy little N.S.W.
bush town lately. A bu-
colic enemy of land-tax,
to whom the term was
something new, mistook
him for the Premier, and
forthwith interviewed the
visitor on the general cus-
sedness of his policy. The
argument had spread to a
considerable length before
the mistake was di s-
eovered.
Ex - parson G. D.
Buchanan, the departing
pulpit-showman of Bris-
bane (Q.), should be even
more successful as a lec-
turer (he’s an Immigration
appointee of the Nelson
Govt.) than he was as a
rostrum-thumper. He’s a
nice, amiable, warm-
souled, bundle-of-nerves-
but - morally - courageous
man to know. He takes
his whisky, and isn’t
ashamed to let anyone
know it, or see him. He
would walk boldly into
the swell entrance of a
hotel before the whole
Presbytery, or the General
Assembly, and, ma con-
shens ! but ye’d lose yer
bet, if ye said there was
no a drappie even in the
vestry. Buchanan wouldn’t
do “ visiting ” work. The
elders (canny Scautch
bodies) had to find a help-
man to do that for him.
But didn’t he draw ? Just
like a man standing stark-
still in the street star-
ing at nothing ! And he brought the bawbees
into the collection-plates. He brought his kirk
out of debt and pit a bit intil its stocking. Ver-
dict of the elders: “Weel, weel; it’s the hond
o’ the Board ! He’s no a’thegither a bright an’ a
shinin’ example: but we dinna hae tae pit oor
honds intil oor breeks ivery now an’ agen! ”
Buchanan, too, has the prehensile aesthetic eye
for a lovely woman. R. S. Smythe has the pre-
hensile aesthetic eye for—but this is anticipating.
Brisbane (Q.) Courier is
hugely advertising its ex-editor, C.
H. Buzacott, in his new venture
with the Rockhampton Record —
the bitterest anti-Brisbane scorpion
yet published.
A very prominent Australian
official has a most artistic glass
eye, which practically defies detec-
tion. The machine of State nearly
stopped short the other day, be-
cause a valet had carelessly emptied
the beautiful optic down a sink,
and the owner couldn’t appear in
public without it. He wasn’t pro-
vided with a spare eye, and it was
necessary to fish long and patiently
in the drain before the orb was re-
covered.
Frank Stuart, ex-M.L.A. for
East Melb., wept bitterly in spirit
when Premier Turner’s knighthood
arrived by cable. Stuart was hon.
member of the Munro Ministry at
the time that Turner was chosen
from the ranks to fill a vacant
billet. Langridge, the Minister of
Customs, had died, and Stuart,
reckoning himself the most desir-
able candidate for the portfolio, re-
tired from “ office ” in a huff when
he didn’t get it. Also, he quite
expected an earthquake to follow
his resignation. But the world
went on as usual, and Frank Stuart
was presently returned to his tailor-
ing establishment by the electors,
who had grown weary of him,
whereas George Turner came back
to the House a bigger man than
ever. And now this absurd inter-
loper of five years ago is Premier
and K.C.M.G., and looms up as
one of the biggest politicians in
Australia. The conviction that he
ought to be Turner, and Turner
ought to be nobody in particular,
is deep-rooted in Stuart’s breast.
Spiritist Dr. Peebles, now orating in Mel-
bourne, talks poor flapdoodle in his lectures. His
white hair and beard give him a sage-like appear-
ance, and he has a good platform style, but his
matter is washy, pointless rubbish. Besides, the
blow which the Mellon exposure gave to spiritism
in this country is too recent for any spookosopher
to make an impression.
NO CLOTHES.
MRS. WAYBACK (perfectly disgusted ): “ Oh, John, come away from
that horrid naked woman. What can you be thinking of?”
JOHN: “ I was — hie—just thinkin', my dear, what a lucky man her
husband must have been. No change in the fashion. No dress-
maker-bills to pay.”
Judge Windeyer, it is printed, will make
a lengthened residence in England. The Bul-
letin rejoices to hear this. It wishes the Mt.
Rennie judge health and prosperity and sincerely
trusts that Australia may never see him or his like
again—on an alleged bench of justice,
Reading reports of
the bizarre questions
put to his visitors by
Li Hung Chang brings
up quite an uncanny
remembrance of the
late Parkes. Some of
his questions to de-
putations are now
famous—especially the
ones to clergymen (who,
by the way, were ever
his devoted admirers
and obedient servants).
It was a favorite de-
vice of his to fence
with awkward sub-
jects or demands by
asking ridiculous ques-
tions or quoting poetry.
Once he had a visit
from a crusty gentle-
man from Melbourne,
of musical proclivities,
who was trying to get
an answer about some
important business, the
object of his visit.
Parkes kept up a run-
ning fire of irrelevant
questions about books,
poetry, and told one or
two stories. The visi-
tor fidgetted about un-
til Parkes asked him
was he fond of music.
Touched upon his rul-
ing passion, he an-
swered: “Yes, Sir
Henry, lam. Passion-
ately ! ” “Do you play
hany hinstrument ? ”
said Parkes, graciously.
“Well, yes,” said the
stranger, modestly. “ I
play the flute and the
’cello a little.” “Oh !”
said Parkes, “ ’ave
you hever ’eard a duet
between a pianoforte
and a Jew’s ’arp?”
The visitor at once felt
for his hat, while the
old man grinned over
his victory.
Boy-murderer Phillips, Melb., is photo-
graphed in his surplice as a churoh chorister;
further zest is given to the picture by the fact that
it was taken only two months ago. A sweetly-
innocent, round, chubby face, the perfection of an
open countenance. Now then, ye phrenologers !
Deakin, M.P., who declined a knighthood,
once heard a friend declaring that some politician
who had been recently knighted had lost ground
politically thereby. Whereupon he replied :
“ While objecting to knighthood on principle, I
am not aware that a title is a disadvantage in a
Democracy.” This opinion, though philosophi-
cally probable, has not been confirmed by recent
Australian experience.
One eminent Melb. discounter can be got
at now and then with hopelessly cronk paper, if
the kite-flyer only exhibits a judicious admiration
of the 60 per shent man’s poetry—which, by the
way, is most awful poetry, many miles worse than
Fitzgibbon’s—or Isaiah Reginald Cohen’s novels.
It takes two or three months of well-managed
admiration to work the financier up, but when he
is worked up he will discount almost anything.
Anthony O’Grady Lefroy, who arrived in
Westralia half a century ago, when Col. Clarke,
father of the Vic. Agent-General, was Governor,
is dead, aged 81. In 1875 he was acting-Col. Sec-
retary, and subsequently held office as Col. Trea-
surer. He came of a high Tory family, one
member of which held the Chief-Justiceship of
the Irish Queen’s Bench, in the interests of his
party, when 90 years of age, and both deaf and
blind.
Ex-Treasurer Ward, of M.L., the man
who went under, is obviously recovering again.
His scandal has practically died out; at the recent
election his enthusiastic constituents returned him
by a big majority—Ward’s co. borrowed so much
money in the North to blew it in impecunious
Southland that it would be rank ingratitude if
they didn’t; and there is even talk of him resum-
ing the Treasurership, which is seemingly being
kept open for him.
Adelaide pressmen claim that they can ac-
curately report Gov. Buxton’s speeches before
they are delivered. They are mainly bun-struggle
orations, and embody a kindly reference to the
quality of the scones and the dreamy delights of
the tea, with a side reference to “ this indicahshun
of the divahne blahsings of Prahvidence,” and
conclude to the general effect that “ this bahzaah
exemplifies the fact that we live under a graht
and glahrious Queen ” !
Fred Weiss, who snatched the Australian
billiard championship from Memmott the other
week, has been always among the best two or three
native-born cueists since 1883, when he showed
himself much superior to Byrne in a match for the
Vic. championship. Nevertheless there was al-
ways a better man to beat him in test matches for
money until Memmott —the only Australian who,
up to now, has earned a billiard reputation in the
other hemisphere—finished 21 points behind him
in a game of 8000 up. Probably Weiss was for-
tunate in beating Memmott, all things considered,
but he did it, and did it very well, scoring 12
breaks of over a century (against Memmott’s 8)
and making the tallest one of the lot, viz, 232.
Such form as that is quite good enough to take to
England, where Weiss will shortly go touring on
his laurels.
“ YOUNG MAN , DON'T YOU FEEL WELL”
MR. DE BILLETY: “Ah, doctor, I feel as if something dreadful was going
to happen !”
EMINENT PRACTITIONER: “ Very likely; you are going to consult a quack.”
On the last hot Saturday a Melb. lady,
cycling along the road from Sorrento, observed
biking in the other direction a disreputable-looking
old man on a very muddy machine. The old
fellow had his coat off and tied around the handle-
bars with a reed. His face was red where it
wasn’t dust-coated, he was smothered in dust
from head to heel, and he was scorching, head
over the bar, evidently to catch the boat to Melb.,
having ridden round the coast. The dusty old
party was Hartley Williams, Victoria’s senior
judge. “No wonder,” said the lady, “he wasn’t
made Chief Justice.”

THE BRIG PHYLLIS.
Melbourne, Wednesday.
Ttio.se im Ixiard the brig Phyllis, which was re-
cently succored at great peril by a boat’s crew from
th? Orient, are still having an exqiting time in their
endeavors to reach Melbourne. Captain Prideaux,
of the steamer Glaucus, which arrived here to-day
from Kembla, reports that when passing Cliffy
Island he saw signals hoisted denoting a ship in
distress to the westward, and at once bore down on
the vessel, which proved to be the brig in question.
It was then, ascertained that those on board the
Phyllis were in want <sf provisions, and a quantity of
food was placed on board by a boat from the
Glaucus, the steamer afterwards proceeding on its
way to Melbourne. Captain Prideaux states that
the crew of the brig presented a half-famished
appearance.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Does Pastor Fitchett stir up enmity
against France with an eye to the New Hebrides ?
The Windeyer clan is, it is stated, feeling
its way to set up one of its number in oppo-
sition to R. A. Price for Gloucester, at next
N.S.W. general election. The Windeyer estate,
Tomago, is in the electorate named.
“ Since the 1896 elections two or three
members of the Labor-party have evinced a strong
desire to get on the Treas ury benches, no matter
how, even in a Ministry led by such a person as
Boodlewraith’s Tozer.”—Brisbane (Q.) Worker.
A parliamentary candidate (Tas.) : “I am
opposed to the metropolitan drainage scheme. It
is only kept alive by Mr. Fysh to provide a billet
for his pet lamb, another of the sucking calves of
the State.” The candidate spoke from the seat of
an antediluvian Irish jaunting-car, very appro-
priately dug up for the occasion.
A brainy and strictly practical N.S.W.
Federal candidate is J, T. Walker, of the Bank of
N.S.W. He is almost the only one so far who has
definitely suggested that the Australian people
ehould trust their Australian Parliament, and not
regard it as a dangerous animal that must be kept
perpetually chained up lest it should break loose
and bite itself. Also, he is almost the only one,
bo far, apart from the Labor candidates, who is
neither a lawyer nor a M.P.
LIVE AND LEARN.
GUSSIE (from Sydney, to ox-conductor beating a bullock): " My good
man, my good man, why evah are you chastising the poor cow in
that mannah?”
STOCKMAN: “ Just knocking the bloomin' milk down — it’s bunged-up some-
where.”
GUSSIE: “ Gwacious; weally; beg pardon, old fellah. Thought you were
rebuking the poor cweatyah. Ah, well, live and learn, live and
learn. ”
It is highly desirable that the Australian
provinces should have a sound Federal Constitu-
tion. Hitherto it has been pretty well all sound.
And if Dan. O’Connor’s candidature be successful
there will be a good deal more sound still. Also
National spirit.
Brisbane (Q.) Worker advises the Q.
Labor-members to stonewall next session all
Ministerial legislation until the Govt, brings in an
Electoral Act Amendment Bill recognising the
“ one-adult-one-vote ” principle. The Boomerang
gave similar advice five years ago.
The Hobart and Launceston experiment
in voting according to a modified Hare system
worked out fairly well. At Hobart 2849 votes
were polled, of which 104 were informal. At
Launceston, of 1827 votes, 58 were informal. This
gives an average of something less than 3| per
cent, of incorrect ballots; which, considering the
fact that Tasmania is the worst educated of the
seven sisters, does not look unreasonable for a first
attempt.
Of the 37 members composing the new
Tas. Parliament the Braddon-Fysh Govt, claims
18 as followers, and the Opposition 12 ; the Inde-
pendents number 7. There is a bare possibility
of a change of Ministry, but the Govt, alleged
policy and that of the Opposition are so much
alike that any change made must orisrinate in
purely personal differences, or from t!.remote
chance of the Independents combining to shake
matters up.
When the Vic. Companies Act was passing
through its last Parliamentary stages, it was pur-
sued to the very end by the malediction of that
sound Tory, G. D. Garter, M.P., who declared
that no respectable man would care to be a direc-
tor under the new order of things. The first
bank balance-sheet published in the rigid form
prescribed by the Act was that of the Bank of
Victoria, with the name of G. D. Carter thereon
as director. So, presumably, Carter has thought
better of it —or else he isn’t respectable.
Wanted, the name of the N.S. Wales M.P.
who is so conscientious that he has paid a sum to
the Railway Department to cover the value of
journeys made by him by rail while on private
business. That member is really too honest to live
in a country like Australia. Consider the compli-
cations into which the lily-white conscience of the
sensitive creature may lead him. Suppose, one
day, when he is at home and only feels half in-
clined to attend Parliament, his wife tells him he
must go to town and buy a pound of bacon, and he
goes into town and attends Parliament after all
(which he wouldn’t have done but for the bacon-
commission), what allowance will he make the
State ?
Chairman of Hobart
political meeting over-
come by the glory of his
position: “Thoseinfavor
of that motion hold up
the right hand, those not
in favor hold up the
left.”
Despite British War
Office reticence re Bren-
nan’s Australian Tor-
pedo, drawings and de-
scriptions of the inven-
tion appeared in Yankee
files a fortnight after the
official trial. The B.
W.O. suppressed Bren-
nan’s papers intended
for publication in Vic-
toria, yet Melb. Public
Library holds a volume
describing the whole
thing.
The little band of
Vic. Freetraders, which
is mainly Max Hirsch
and Murray Smith, per-
petually implores that
province to give up
nearly £1, 000,000 of Cus-
toms revenue gained in-
cidentally by Protective
duties, in order to enjoy
the great blessing of im-
ported Shoddy. The
reason why Hirsch and
co. are never likely to
succeed is that no one of
them has the courage or
the brains to explain
how this lost sum is to
be made up. N.S.W.
fills the gap principally
with its land - revenue,
but Vic. has no land-
value worth speaking of.
The gap could be filled
by raising the income-
tax to about 4s. in the
£, or by confiscating the
rents of practically all
the lands in the pro-
vince—in other words,
by land-nationalisation
without compensation.
But it would be a party
of considerable energy
that would openly face
either alternative, and
the Hirsch-Smith crowd
isn’t equal to it.
The N.S.W. delegates to the Federal Con-
vention should be : Bishop Smith, Cardinal Moran,
the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, the
chairman of the Congregational Union, the presi-
dent of the Wesleyan Conference, the chairman of
the Baptist Assembly, Commandant Booth, the
secretary of the Social Purity Society, the presi-
dent of the W.C.T.U., and G. E. Ardill (the
wholesale and pious philanthropist). No country
can possibly progress except on broad religious
lines.
According to a list of Sydney prices pub-
lished in the Daily Telegraph on Ist January,
the removal of the duty of 6d. per bushel on wheat
has been accompanied by a rise of 6d. in the price;
•£1 a ton duty was taken off flour, and it went up
£2 10s. ; 3d. a gallon was taken off kerosene, and
it only went down l^d.—so the revenue loses 3d.,
which has to be taken from the people again by
some other form of taxation, while the consumer
only gains half that sum ; 3d. duty was taken off
China-oil, and the price only went down 2d ; 3d.
duty was taken off castor-oil, and the price went
up lid. ; £3 duty was taken off white lead, and
the price only dropped £2 10s. ; and £2 taken off
ordinary galvanised-iron reduced the price only

lishes articles by the guttural Hirsch on the

sumer somewhere between ,£1 11s. and £5. Why
this vast discrepancy ?
“ MADE IN GERMANY”: A sketch on the arrival
of the s.s. Friedrich der Grosse.
To reform the Australian Upper Cham-
bers : turn them into lethal chambers for half-an-
hour, and then sweep them out.
Q. Socialist League has determined to
counter the Nelson project of immigration
from Great Britain by arranging that a state-
ment of Queensland’s “ true position ” shall
“ appear in all the important socialistic and demo-
cratic journals of Great Britain.”
Apropos of the jeremiads about the pros-
pective downfall of various Australian cities if
Federation comes to pass, and about the way the
Federal capital will mop up the trade and popula-
tion of other centres, the experience of Maoriland
is interesting. In the early days, M.L. had six
provincial capitals. Auckland had a short turn
at being the capital when provincialism was
abolished, and then, 30 years ago, the seat of
government shifted to Wellington, while Auckland
was left to perish. Thereafter- the latter place
proceeded to boom, and now it is the biggest
centre in M.L., with Dunedin second, Christchurch
third, and the windy capital only a good fourth.
The N.S.W. Protectionists who have
spoken on Federation up to date are a disappoint-
ing crowd. Dibbs is against Federation on large,
general, damnchicago principles. Lyne is vaguely
hostile and non-committal. R. E. O’Connor
wants the two most important items—the rail-
ways and public debts—left out. Copeland does
likewise, and goes one worse by boosting up the
candidature of Cardinal Moran, and proposing
that there should be no uniform franchise but
each province should elect its representatives any
way it pleases, so that the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment will be about the only legislature on earth
with no power to reform its own franchise. T. M.
Slattery, judging by his remarks in the correspon-
dence-column of the D.T., regards federation of
the railways and public debts as an open question.
So far, the Labor-party in N.S.W. seems far
more promising than either of the other crowds.
“Federation is in the air.” You don’t
say ? Queensland complains that Australia wants
to rob her of her rights and make her parochial.
Central Queensland complains that South Queens-
land has robbed and is robbing her of her rights,
and has made her sub-provincial. West Central
Queensland complains that Central Queensland is
worse to the West than ever the South was to the
Centre. Result: Queensland is pulling away
from the rest of Australia; Central Queensland is
pulling away from South Queensland ; and West
Central Queensland is raising the hatchet to cut
the ligature that binds it to East Central Queens-
land. Add to this that the North, the bad old
North, has always been clamoring for “its own,”
and you complete the present picture ; while there
is the prospect that, in the near future, “the
Gulf,” with Normanton as its head, will be singing
to Townsville, Port Douglas, Cairns and Cook-
town —“ We don’t want to play m your yard.”
The very Port Darwin store-
keepers, who were lately urging their
M’sP. to pass the Colored Immigration
Restriction Act, are now asking Govt,
to waive its provisions in order to
admit of the importation of Chinese
carpenters from Singapore. Govt.,
however, does not consider the cy-
clone a sufficient excuse for the employ-
ment of Chinese cheap labor, and is
forcing the Port Darwin folk to be con-
sistent by sending up white labor
from Adelaide.
Because of a visible rift between
some of the Q. Labor members and
the advanced socialist section, Bris-
bane Courier editorially and patron
isingly advises the former to abandon-
“ socialism in our time,” to “join the
Ministerialists (!), and, in that alliance
(1 !), to share in doing better work
than has yet been done by Parlia-
ment since self-government was aston-
ished.” Small wonder that editor
Ward’s friends are so frequently con-
cerned about his health.
Ex-Premier Dibbs says that he
will not be a candidate for the Federal
Convention. Has any one heard any-
thing of a demand for Dibbs in such
a capacity? Also, considering a re-
cent speech in which the long ex-re-
publican denounced Federation as a
means of finding billets _ for hungry
politicians, and Federationists as a
crowd of conspirators against the
blessed Empire, would any person who
knew the circumstances be such a great
particular lunatic as to give Dibbs a
single vote? Dibbs may not be a
candidate even though he says he
won’t, but if he is one it is the duty of
every Federationist to leave him care-
fully at the bottom of the poll. The
reason why the bottom of the poll is
the right place for Dibbs on such an
occasion is that there is no place lower
down in which to plant him. Let us
now proceed to damn Chicago.
Although there was a wild extravagance in
the Gympie (Q.) Truth’s recent supposititious next
Tozer Ministry, the abundance of smoke warrants
the belief in a fire. Apparently, Tozer is scheming
to form a third party, and is taking full advantage
of Premier Nelson’s and Attorney-General Byrnes’
absence in (or towards) Tasmania. Nelson will
soon resign despite all entreaties, and is likely to
recommend Gov. Lamington to send for Byrnes.
But Byrnes has made himself disliked. If he is
sent for, the splits will definitely shape themselves.
“Mines and Railways ” Philp’s appointment as
Acting-Treasurer is the one clever move on Nel-
son’s part in this connection. Philp is not self-
assertive, but he is liked, and can command a
following, while the Labor-party regards him as
almost neutral in its fight against Fat Man.
Leischeit, or Leichhardt, hitherto known as Lesah,
or Lesagh. He is believed to have been mur-
dered and buried by Butler, alias Harwood,
the alleged assassin of Lee Weller and Preston.
In the Tas. general election 14 members
were returned unopposed. For the 23 contested
seats only about 11,000 voters recorded their
wishes. Result: Less than 7000 of the 50,000
1 asmanian male bread-winners have elected the
new Parliament. Withal, seven brand-new mem-
bers have been sent in, indicating that if all Tas.
electors cou.d be kept awake long enough to record
then votes, the old members would have been
totally abolished and a new lot sent in to battle
with the House of Landlords. And, as the new
members are decidedly more democratic than
their predecessors (three of them owe their elec-
tion to their endorsement of the Labor platform),
i really seems that Tasmania is not quite so sound
asleep as it used to be.

arner’s Safe Cure and Pills I always recom-
mend in the highest terms. For many years
I was a sufferer from liver and kidney com-
plaint, being subject to severe bilious
attacks, and these medicines gave me speedy
relief.— John J. McJannet, Registrar, Bun-
gendore, N.S.W.
friend of mine advised me to try Warner’s
Safe Cure for the liver. I did so, and I feel
sure that if many people who are suffering
from liver complaint only knew how easily
they could be cured by Warner’s Safe Cure
they would not delay in obtaining it. — Geo.
H. Bennett, M.P., Melbourne, Richmond.
esumed my duties in this city after taking

ntil I tried Warner’s Safe Cure I was a great
sufferer from indigestion. Some of my

Warner’s Safe Cure persuaded me to give it
a trial, and I am pleased to say it cured
me.— A. W. Parsons, M.P.S., Chemist,

Indisputable Facts.
According to our Insurance Standard 50 per cent,
of authors, 42 per cent, of clergymen, 30 per cent,
of lawyers, 27 per cent, of teachers, and 24 per
cent, of doctors, reach the age of 70 years. Many
explanations have been offered for the longevity
of intellectual men. Having experience as well as
intelligence, they understand the science of pre-
serving health by avoidance of those acts of care-
lessness and neglect which tend to shorten life.
By an intelligent diversity of pursuits, taking re-
quired rest, and by a careful regimen, one helps
to keep the body in good condition. It is know-
ledge how to live and how to quickly check the
first approaching signs of ailments, wtiich prolongs
life. Mr. John W. Walsh, of the Australian
Widows’ Life Assurance Co., 263 George-street,
Sydney, N.S.W., says: “I suffered very much
from chronic indigestion for the past four years.
After returning from a trip to Adelaide, say fifteen
month ago, I met an old friend of mine, Mr. I. D.
Nelson, of Pearl Bay, who advised me to try War-
ner’s Safe Cure, as both he and some members of
his family had been suffering from a similar com-
plaint, and had been completely cured by it. I
tried about six bottles, and am pleased to tell you
I feel now completely cured, and will always have
the greatest pleasure in recommending it to my
numerous friends throughout the colonies.”*

The utter unfitness of the Melbourne Cricket
Ground for cycling has been demonstrated so frequently
that there is no longer any excuse for the organisers of
meetings, and now such should certainly be held respon-
sible for accidents, and stand in readiness for a man-
slaughter trial in case of a fatality. The L.V.W., as the
governing body of Vic. cycling, would naturally be
expected to set a good example, but, unable to withstand
the prospects of a big gate, it held its annual meeting
there on the two last Saturdays. A sprinkling of rain
fell each day, with the result that the best man won in
scarcely a single race, and the majority of heats consisted
of tangled heaps of broken bikes and hairy legs massed at
intervals along the track.
During every bicycle-race dozens of collisions
occur—where handles or pedals strike without doing any
more harm on a decent track than altering a competitor’s
course by a couple of inches. But put the men on a flat,
grass surface on a wet day, and the slightest touch causes
a skid and the fall of one or more.
The League Cup final was a dreary fiasco. Up
to the middle of the last lap there was every prospect of
a great finish, when second, third, fourth, and fifth fell
in a heap, and allowed L. Barker, on 240, to win by a
street. The probabilities are that Barker would have
annexed the prize anyhow, but he would have had to
battle hard with Taylor, one of the fallen. The winner is
the 20-year-old son of Mrs. Barker, proprietress of Mel-
bourne’s boss pork-shop. Last September, Joe Royal, the
trainer who first brought Parsons to the front, picked
Barker out as the most promising of the season’s crop of
novices, and he has had him in hand ever since. Royal
prophesies great things for the lad.
Parsons started in the same event, and, though
he was vaguely understood to have recovered his lost
form, he ran badly and finished nowhere. Parsons’ light
is out.
The best race of the day was the 25-mile cham-
pionship, for which 41 riders tried, though it was divested
of much interest by Martin, Walne, and Lesna, the
Frenchman, who made his first appearance in Australia,
falling ere six miles were turned off. Grantor did a mar-
vellous amount of pacing, and, though one by one the
competitors dropped out, R. Johnstone, with a huge
ironical 1 on his back, rode last until a mile from home.
Then he made his rush, but couldn’t stay it out, Porta,
Gargurevich, and Kellow passing him at the bell. The
scene then was the most exciting since Mai. M’Lean
beat Martin last season. Though it was a quarter past 6,
the crowd, which had stayed to see out the race, jumped
crankily in the air, yelling for its various champions.
“ Gargy ” made a great effort in the last 50yds., but the
Italian shook him off and won by half-a-iength. The
ground was rushed, cheering was kept up for fully five
minutes, and the grinning Porta was carried in.
One thing is certain : with his recent rapid
improvement Porta stands on a level with the best. The
next handicap will see him on the same mark as Bil-
martin.
Little Gargurevich, scarcely sft. 3in. but
splendidly proportioned, would have been just as popular
a winner as Porta. “Garfish” deserves a big win; he
has never won more than a £lO prize in his life, and very
few of them, yet he is a first-class man, and is handi-
capped accordingly.
Ken Lewis, who leaves for England in March,
is to be accorded a benefit meeting. Lewis is a native of
Kyneton, Vic., but,’ on the strength of having spent a
year in M.L., he is boomed by all sports promoters as a
Maorilander.
A man who deserves a benefit if any cyclist
does is David Kirk, a first-class man, but one who always
had luck against him. Kirk fell while training in Nov.
last and, injuring bis spine, has been in Melb. Hospital
ever since. He will never ride again—and, it is feared,
will never quite recover. Now that the boom is on to
overlook Kirk’s claim would be a shame.

S.M. Herald advocates the adoption of the
Viennese (Austrian) system of preventing bike smashes,
by which every cyclist must pass an exam, in pro-
ficiency. Those who pass are supplied with a diploma
bearing their photos. Those who don’t are forbidden to
ride in the streets till they do. Pretty in theory ; but the
man who usually comes to grief is not the novice, but the
other fellow, who, having mastered his machine, begins
to put on “ side,” to carry a portmanteau in one hand, and
lift his hat to strange women with the other, and to scoot
at full speed among trams and ’buses while watching a
dog-fight over his left shoulder.
* * * *
The first day of N.S.W. v. Vic. was in general
a day of good bowling, poor batting, poor fielding.
N.S.W. began the alleged batting by Donnan hitting a ball
on his wicket first thing, by Mackenzie poking about half-
an-hour for 0 runs, by Kelly getting caught second ball,
by Iredale playing very badly and doing his utter worst
by running Gregory out. The only N.S.W. batsmen to
shape against Roche and Trumble were Noble and
M’Kibbin. Noble brilliantly cut and drove all the Vic.
bowling, but was missed by Carlton and Trumble. Ire-
dale was missed three times until, with his score at 22,
Roche swept his bails off with a fast break-back. The
only man who scored without giving a chance was
M’Kibbin. Had half the chances been taken N.S.W.
wouldn’t have reached 100 runs. As it was, the first
innings totalled 159, of which the colt, Noble, scored 71.
The hepo of the innings was this youngster. He
went in facing a rot, facing confident bowlers who had
sent the first four of the N.S.W. batsmen back to the
pavilion for 23 runs. The first ball from Trumble just
missed the off stump, but the colt sent the second to the
fence, and from that on the limber 23-year-old played a
plucky, aggressive game, stopped the rot, and showed his
side that although Roche and Trumble could “ do a bit”
on the good wicket, their bowling could be smitten.
Noble is the youngster who made that fine 152 (not out)
against Stoddart and Co.
Roche, who got 6 wickets for 63 first innings,
is a red-headed young man of medium stature. Having-
lost his first and second fingers and part of his thumb, he
is a bowling curiosity. He turns his slow ones well from
the off, and he shoots down quite a first-class fast one at
judicious intervals.
The start of the Vic. first innings was inaus-
picious enough, especially as the Vic’s had the fourth
wicket in front of them. There was a howl from the
crowd when M’Leod hit M’Kibbin on and one wicket was
down for 9. M’Leod walked back hanging his head down
in disgust and carrying one hand in his pocket. Graham,
who followed, pretty well knocked the cover off some of
Bilowell’s balls, stepping in to the young farmer and
driving him with great dash. Bruce soon left, so Graham
and Worrall, each of whom had made a century the
Saturday previous, partnered each other. Graham, how-
ever,’went out for 17, and had a slice of luck in getting
them ; and Worrall must needs step in and make a creaser
of a ball and retire for 15. Four for 68; but Trott and
Laver stayed the procession.
* * • *
Bruce batted out of form first innings for his 16
runs. Bruce is none too popular with the Sydneyites;
he is rememb'ered as the subtle logician who, when pick-
ing the last Aus. Eleven, threw out Lyons because the
English season might be wet, and Turner because the
English season might be dry.
Though many misses occurred, a few catches
reached exhibition standard. Trott, at point, fielding
with all his old cleverness throughout, caught Garrett
high up left hand —the ball would have struck the
boundary. M’Leod ran a long way to catch Turner off a
very hard drive ; his speed and catching effort brought
him down, and he rolled over and over with the ball in
his hand. Johns nipped both Noble and Coningham off
fast and bumpish balls from Trumble. Johns kept wicket
handsomely first innings—Kelly’s work afterwards was
amateurish by comparison. What a mannerism Johns
has of throwing his hands up whether he gets the ball or
not 1
Everyone knows how Graham can hit. But
M’Kibbin took Graham’s hardest off his own bowling—the
day’s sensation it was. Coningham caught Bruce off
M’Kibbin in the slips, took a fast low ball left-handed
with the deftness and ease of a juggler’s trick.
The men whom the Sydney crowd greeted most
cordially were Trott, Gregory, and Coningham. Trott,
on coming out to bat, received a tremendous welcome ;
he had to keep taking his hand out of his pocket and
raising his cap all the time of his march to the wicket. It
was the heartiest and most sincere welcome that a player
has received from a Sydney crowd for many a long day.
The ovation par excellence was when Gregory
made his historical 201 against Stoddart and Co. Gregory,
being the midget, receives spontaneous recognition
everywhere ; when Syd. used to drive big Richardson to
the boundary in England the crowd would cheer itself
hoarse. By the way, the little man used the one bat all
through the recent tour, scoring some 1700 runs off it.
Cricket has now and then a tincture of humor
in it. When Turner went on to bowl last Saturday he
sent down four preliminary balls with professional
solemnity ; then carefully measured his run by stepping it
out beforehand ; then marked himself a starting-point
with his foot; grasped the ball tightly, raised his arm
aloft, ran up and delivered. Four ! Trott rather likes
Turner, and it was the sweetest of drives this one. .
Coningham had bad luck and the sympathy of
the crowd on Saturday—three catches missed off him in
two overs, for two of which Iredale’s yarning in the slips
was responsible.
The time of excitement was when N.S.W., 110
runs behind, came out for the second innings. Would
the home team make a fight, or would the first innings
rot—4 for 23—repeat itself? The brunt of the battle was
borne by Gregory and Donnan ; they put on 70 runs for
the second wicket, and put heart into their partisans.
When Gregory was 35 Trott made a desperate effort to
catch him. It was a hard, fast chance; Trott got one
hand and then the other on the ball quite half-a-dozen
times before he lost it.
Graham is a wonderful shot from the field at the
wicket. Two or three times while standing against the
fence he threw- the ball in at lightning pace full on the
stumps, sending the bails flying. Once Gregory was
almost out to one of these sensational returns.
Johns’ English trip has seasoned his nerves ;
some of his work was artistically perfect—catching
Coningham and Gregory, for example. And he stumped
his man so quickly that the batsman’s stroke and the
flipping off the bails seemed one act.
The Victorian first innings was typical of
cricket. Worrall and Graham, each of whom had scored
a century the Saturday previous, were sent back for 15
and 17 respectively ; four were down for 68. Then Trott
and Laver put on 175, when Trott fell to a catch, which
went straight into Gregory’s hands in the most convenient
style. And then, without another run being scored,
Laver marched back after his captain, his agricultural leg-
scoop missing a fast leg-break from Coningham. Four
for 68, five for 243, six for 243, seven for 245, 10 for 269 ;
M’Kibbin in his last few overs getting four wickets for 7

“No one I ever saw,” remarks the veteran C.
Bannermann, “ could upset a side like Lyons. Let him be
in five minutes and be has tied his opponents in a knot.
I remember on one of the occasions when I stood umpire
for N.S.W. in Adelaide. Lyons came in ; took block ; hit
a four ; wiped his forehead ; hit another four ; re-wiped
his forehead ; hit two or three more fours which the
fieldsmen stopped for singles ; hit a fiver ; changed ends ;
wiped his forehead and hitched up his pants. I looked
up at the board thinking that he must be 20 ; he was 50 1
It was the biggest surprise I ever got in cricket.” Apropos,
Syd. Gregory relates that- once when Lyons was batting
in England, Gregory went from the pavilion into the dress-
ing-room for his pipe and coat. He put on his coat,
filled his pipe, lighted it, took half a dozen draws, and
came back. The game was over. The mighty smiter
had played the devil in those few moments on a bad
wicket.

Eighteen-year-old Lane’s win of the 220-yards
amateur swimming championship in 2min. 46sec. was a
great performance for a youngster. Lane finished in

keep a level head there should be a great swimming
future ahead of him.

Ted Flack, the Australian crack harrier (writes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent) has decided to
give up all competitive running and to concentrate his
energies on becoming an expert accountant and a pillar
of strength to the paternal firm. Excluding an occa-
sional sprint with the Thames Harriers, the only running
he does now is up tracks of figures. A natural runner,
not too robust physically, training added little to his
capacities of speed and endurance, and he would never
get beyond the third-class pedestrian division in England.
His defeat by a modern “Matoosekos” Greek at the
Olympic Games was a severe blow to his pedestrian pride,
which finally fell to pieces when King George of Greece
shook his hand in vigorous sympathy. The Swanston-
street fruit-sellers were at last avenged.

As pointed out by Mr. Thackeray, when the
big smelting works at the tidal lagoons, Lakes Macquarie
and Illawarra, are in full blast the fish will be banished
and the angler will know the lakes no more. It is already
necessary to set aside and stringently protect a few more
of the small coastal lagoons in readiness for the depletion
of the large ones. And Sydney Harbour itself has been
utterly spoilt as a fishing ground by the sunken nets o
the “Dagoes,” aided by the “ .neshmEr -nets oftne
whites. On that once-famous bream-groun , • h't-
at Manly, half-a-dozen mesh-nets are worked every B_>
even the local wharves are now feneed in b -' nle * n f flgh .
and this by the very people who live on the sale of hsh
ing-tackle and the letting out of boats.
George Giffen decided on his return to Adelaide
to abandon club cricket for the rest of the >
onlv play in the match againstlictoria, in t „ J ip a m
a good offer was wired from Westralia to take a team
there. Giffen says the majority of the ! ate A.. ■ ~
team are willing to go, but the S.A. ohampion w , ,
have difficulty in obtaining extended leave, and it look
as if the spec, will fall through. #
In the palmv days of the Sydney ring a young
man came to to learn boxing ; he explained that
he considered the accomplishment useful,

all concerned very satisfactory ; at its conclusion the m
satisfied person groped round the ring : side for his teac
—he had to feel his way because both eyes were Closed-
Finding the instructor, he spat out one of his few r -
maining front teeth, and reproachfully said : Look at

dropped me into ! And you kidded me I was a wonder.

“ * Bob ’ Wain, builder and part-owner of the
Ettie, has,” The Bulletin hears, “ never sailed inher.
About 14 years ago he was in a boating accident in More-
ton Bay, when three lives were lost. He never r J,carnt to
swim, and prefers to follow races per steamer. The Ettie
has had a very unsuccessful season, not winning a single
race. This is perhaps accounted for by the absence of
‘ Fred ’ Clark, her skipper, who has been away in the
North. He is the son of Ned Clarke, senr., an old Sydney
Harbor identity, one of the ‘ Podge’ Newtown days. The
Ettie is a real ‘ hummer ’ in all weather, barring a jump
when her boomerang keel “puts her away” to leeward.
Just as “bicycle ” came down to “ bike,” so has
“ motor-car” dropped to “ mocar.”

The recent insolvency of a certain cricketer has
an obvious moral for the young Australian athlete.
Bankrupt, a capable chemist, became famous in the field
of sport, and sought the bubble reputation at the wickets
and elsewhere to the detriment of his trade. Finally he
opened a tobacco-shop (he is a non-smoker) upon a micro-
scopic capital, trusting to his sporting friends to rally up;
but they apparently stayed away with great unanimity.
Moral: Lay to your book.

Pedlar Palmer, the champion English feather-
weight, has been giving exhibition spars with his younger
brother at the outer London “ halls.” As might be ex-
pected, he showed little from which to take a sure line as
to his capabilities. He is a ratty-looking, prematurely-
aged customer with the orthodox “ leading left ” and the
insufficiently-used, lacking-steam “ right.” Clever and
quick with both feet and head, he takes some hitting, but
the Griffo-that-might-have-been would have supplied and
delivered the necessary quietus within, at the outside, three
rounds. Palmer, junior, is a very likely lad for 7st. 61b.,
and may be heard of, but the Pedlar, who is a bookmaker
at intervals, will lose to the first multum-in-parvo of
youthful stamina that he encounters.

Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills act directly on the
blood, and thus it is that they are so famous for
the cure of anaemia and rheumatism, scrofula,
chronic erysipelas, and to restore pale and sallow
complexions to the glow of health. They are also
a splendid nerve and spinal tonic, and thus have
cured many cases of paralysis, locomotor ataxy,
neuralgia, St. Vitus’ dance, and nervous headache.
They are now obtainable of all chemists, and from

The Lady who Does the Washing.
There lives at number 20, Riverdale-road, Plum-
stead, a Mrs. J. Pettett, who has an interesting
experience to relate. Mrs. Pettett has resided in
Plumstead for the last six or seven years, and is a
highly respectable lady, esteemed by the inhabi-
tants of the locality.
About three months ago she caught a chill,
which resulted in pleurisy and dropsy. An able
doctor was called, but she gradualy became worse,
enduring acute agony and growing daily more and
more enfeebled and wasted—a mere shadow of her
former self. Soon it began to be whispered
amongst the kind friends who ministered by her
bed of sickness : “ The poor thing cannot be for
long in this world.” As a last resource the hus-
band, having heard of the beneficial effects of Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, procured
some of them in the city. The result (to which
Mrs. Pettett and her friends gladly testify) was
truly marvellous. She was quickly transformed
from a helpless, bed-ridden, pain-racked creature
to a strong and healthy woman, who can, to use a
colloquialism, “ do a hard day’s work at home with
any woman.” Before taking the Pills she had
spent pounds and pounds on doctors’ medicine,
but had only received momentary relief.
To a West Ham Herald reporter Mrs. Pettett
herself gave information of incalculable service to
suffering humanity.
“ About three years ago my health," she said,
“ began to fail me; I became weak, habitually
languid, and depressed. Life was a burden to me.
At length, about a year ago, I consulted my doctor,
on whose advice I took change of air and scene,
but they did me no good. My appetite failed,
and I began to gradually waste away. t For some
little time I had noticed a peculiar numbness in
my hands, which were often as dead to me.
Shortly before last Easter I 'caught a cold, and
pleurisy and dropsy ensued.. My legs and feet
were swollen to almost twice their usual size, and
the pleurisy caused me excruciating pain. I took
to my bed, scarcely able to move hand or foot. I
subsisted on nothing but tea and water.
“ Why did you send for Dr. Williams’ Pills ? ”
“We were induced to do so by some neighbors
who had tried them, and reported truly marvellous
things of their effect in ‘building up’ the system.
I procured the Pills merely as the last resource.
But the results were wonderful. I took three
Pills per day ; the numbness left me after the first
day, and in three or four days the pleurisy and
dropsy had so far gone that I, who had been
hitherto helpless as a baby, was able to leave my
bed. Gradually both pleurisy and dropsy disap-
peared, and they have not troubled me since. My
appetite is now excellent; and I can perform all
my household duties, including the ‘washing.’”


Unable to Work!
NO APPETITE !
COULD NOT SLEEP!
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
COMPLETELY CURED HIM.
Mr. T. J. Clune, of Walkerville, Ade-
laide, South Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, I had an attack of
Indigestion and Liver Complaint
that lasted for weeks ; I was unable
to do any hard work, had no appe-
tite, food distressed me, and I suf-
fered much from headache. My
skin was sallow and sleep did not
refresh me. I tried several reme-
dies and consulted a doctor, with-
out obtaining any relief; finally,
one of my customers recommended
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It helped me
from the first, —in fact, after taking
six bottles I was completely cured,
and could eat anything and sleep
like a child.”

Melbourne and Stanley streets, South
Brisbane, are rapidly being handed over to the
Syrian and the Indian. Most of the shops “near
the Bridge ” are occupied by the alien, but even
yet an odd white child may be seen playing in the
gutter with the hordes of colored kiddies.
Dear Bulletin,—“ The Banjo’s ” remark
in his excellent station sketch “ White When He’s
Wanted ” “ had it not been for that indefinable,
self-reliant look one might have taken him for a
swagman,” sticks in my throat! If “Banjo”
meant a “ sundowner ” or a “ whaler ” (men who
never work) he should have said so. Drovers, like
all bush workers, are swagmen—sometimes. So,
if this “self-reliant look” exists at all swagmen
must be burdened with it as well, unless the
drover man hides it in the bottom of his boots
when he’s out of a job. True, horsemen are more
respected in the bush than swagmen ; and drovers,
shearers and horse-breakers who travel mostly on
horseback look down with infinite contempt upon
the man who walks and carries his swag. But
even the proudest horseman makes a splash
occasionally and “ jumps his moke aver
the bar,” and has to walk away from
the shanty and the keeper’s daughter with
his bundle up, in search of any kind of work
to raise the price of more horseflesh. I recently
met a chap I knew further out when I used to
follow droving. He was riding the kind of a horse
most people like to lose, and no one cares about
finding—a poor, miserable, toothless crock. You
could count his ribs blindfolded, and hang up
tin plates all over him. His lower lip was hang-
ing down his chest, and his eyes were always
half-closed. The whole frame seemed only kept
together by an old greenhide saddle-girth, and
threatened to fall in a huddled heap the moment
the girth was unbuckled. “ Don’t like this part
of the country,” said my drover friend, as he
awoke his noble steed, who’d fallen fast asleep the
minute he stopped, with a jerk of the hay-band
reins; “ nothing but miserable swag-humping
fellers about these here parts.” That night at the
station (I got there before him on foot) he planted
his heap of bones in the scrub and sneaked to the
store with his ration-bags. “It don’t look well,”
he whispered into my ear, “ for a horseman to be
seen cadging a pint o’ dust.” —6 xB.
Item from a Canadian paper :
For years I have been searching- over the world for
genuine Christians. At one time I thought I had found
them in Mrs. Girling and the Shakers, but their faith did

Then I thought that Count Leo Tolstoi might pass mus-
ter as one, but it is evident he spends too much of his
time in literature. At last I seem to have got on the
track. There is a small Catholic monastery at Ottawa,
Canada, the inhabitants of which are known as grave-
diggers. The Daily Mail says the members of this
organisation number a dozen all told, but Jesuitical rule
is no more severe than theirs. Their one garment is a
loose brown robe. They wear neither hats, shoes, nor
stockings, and each day they perform a little of the task
of digging their own graves. Every morning at dawn, be
it fine weather or bad, each monk takes the iron spade
from his cell and wends his way to the garden, where he
solemnly delves in the dewy ground and slowly raises a
spadeful of earth from the spot where one day his
own body will be laid. Day by day, shovelful by
shovelful, each brother digs his grave, and if he does not
die by the time the grave is finished he begins, shovelful
by shovelful, to return the cast-up soil. Should death
come while the grave is unfinished, the dead man’s com-
rades complete the task for him. Then, after hours of
silent prayer, the uncoffined body is lowered into the
ground, clad in the garments it has worn during life.
After breakfast each member of the sect slings two cotton
bags over his shoulder and starts out on his regular tour
of begging. The rules of the society forbid its members
to do any sort of worldly labor. They are not permitted
to own a penny’s worth of anything, and none can eat any
article which is not received by begging. The brothers
pass almost their entire time in begging and praying.
This, I fancy, is as near an approach to genuine Chris-
tianity as can be found outside lunatic asylums.

Illustrative of how the cunningest of le-
vanters from the law leave loopholes of identifica-
tion : A big Northern official got wrong in his
arithmetic and had to lie low. Police and detec-
tives were watching his suspected haunts, and all
precautions were taken that he shouldn t cross
over to “ the other side ”of a river. Escape any
other way was nearly impossible, and an attempt
highly improbable. However, the levanter, with
the assistance of some friends, was shaved, dis-
guised, and clothed in a digger’s costume. He
was got over the river, furnished with funds, and
actually got on a distant diggings, where he was
to keep quiet until the scent was cold, after which
he was to “clear for Guam.” But a suspicious
constable arrested him, and the only clue was his
boots. He couldn’t bear bluchers and stuck to
the old style of cities. The bobby noted it, and
pondered, and gazed, and studied the Police
Gazette.


Herr Bunsen,
the celeickated

Herbal Remedies

A few words as to the progress and growth in
public favour of the Registered Alfaline Herbal
Remedies would not be out of place here, and
would be additional evidence as to their real
genuineness and great virtues as claimed for them
by Herr Rassmussen, their discoverer and sole
proprietor.
The great virtues of the Alfaline Herbal Reme-
dies are so well known that it is quite unnecessary
to say much in regard to them in this notice ; the
very fact of their having been before the public
for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and may be seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented
in the History of Herbal Remedies.
About twelve years ago Herr Rassmussen intro-
duced these Remedies to the Australian public by
opening a Depot for their sale at 547 George
Street, Sydney, N.S.W., his present Head Office,
and although at that time he did not advertise in
any journal, the wonderful virtues of these Reme-
dies were known far and wide within a few
months. Orders for them came from every
quarter, not only from all the Australian colonies,
but from all over the world. In 1891 the clamour
for the Alfaline Herbal Remedies had become so
great that it became impossible to supply everyone
from the Sydney Depot. Letters arrived by thou-
sands, many orders came by telegraph, and some
people even travelled over a thousand miles to
make sure of obtaining some of these God-inspired
Remedies. What was to be done ? It was Herr
Rassmussen’s duty to see that every sufferer from
the Blood, Skin, Nerves, Liver, and other affec-
tions, whose very life and happiness depended on
these Remedies, should be able to obtain same
without undue delay. Herr Rassmussen had thus
no other alternative than to open Branch Depots
for the sale of the Alfaline Remedies in every
colony, and, if possible, in every country in the
world, as he desired to keep the sale of his Herbal
Remedies in his own hands entirely, and thus
avoid the agency of chemists, who generally have
a substitute which they prefer to sell instead of
the real article. A start was made at once in that
direction, and a very large and palatial Depot
was opened at 150 Bourke Street, Melbourne, in
1891. Immediately after, a fine Branch was
established at 154 Rundle Street, Adelaide, fol-
lowed by the opening of an extensive Branch at
91 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New r Zealand. A
large Branch was then established at the corner of
Hay and William Streets, Perth, W.A., and
shortly after another Branch, next to Coolgardie
Hotel, Bailey Street, Coolgardie, and N 0.2 Lin-
dell’s Chambers, Hannan street, Kalgoorlie, W.A.,
not to forget the very extensive Branch opened
some seven years ago at 160 Queen Street, Bris-
bane, which is now the Head Depot for Queens-
land, and finally a Branch just opened at Charters
Towers, North Queensland.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of Testimonials to that
effect.
The whole of these Branches are each doing a
large and flourishing business. There is not a
country on the face of the globe where these Re-
medies have not been heard of, and orders arrive
daily from the uttermost parts of the earth.

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had from you
were of great benefit to me and others. In one case,
when three hunters and trappers were travelling about
the ranges near my 7 place on the Rose River, one was taken
very ill ; his mates intended taking him in a w 7 aggon to
Wangaratta (about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor.
I gave him a few of your Pills. I am pleased to inform
you that, having to pass their camp next day, I found
him up and pegging-out his skins and looking well. This
speaks volumes for your valuable Remedies.”

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussbn. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l
remain, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,

from General Debility of the System for oyer seven years,
and having tried without success several of the leading

try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did so, for

A Sufferer Cured of Piles.
I suffered terribly from Piles, but, thank God, I got
immediate relief from your Alfaline Pile Remedies. I
have not been troubled with them since, and it is now
two years ago. I have recommended them to many
friends, who bless the day I told them about it. I cannot
thank you enough for the cure your Remedies effected
in my case, and the relief it gave me from continuous
suffering. J. KILLERIDGE,

A Cyclist Cured of Piles.
It affords me very great pleasure to bear testimony to
the efficacy of your Alfaline Pile Powders, which cured
me after almost every known medicine had failed. My
case was a most serious one ; it had been caused through
bicycle-riding in wet weather, and the Piles were of the
internal kind and caused me the most excrusiating pain.

leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land.”

incurable.”

speak from personal knowledge, and can vouch for the
great cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s wonderful
Remedies. Having seen many cured sufferers, and ex-

gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become

Colin Archer, of Laurwig, Norway, builder
of Nansen’s Fram, is a blood relation of the well-
known Queensland pioneering family of the same
Scottish name. Baron Oscar Dickson, the great
monetary aider of Polar exploration, is also of
Caledonian descent. Northern Scots, Icelanders,
Norroway-men, and Danskers were ever great in-
termarryers, which accounts for Scotch names
being as common in the Norse-Swedish peninsula
as Scandinavian names in Scotland and the
Orkneys.
John Sands’ Sydney Directory (just issued
for 1897) has naturally no local rival. It is so
good that enterprise could hardly make a better.
And when comparison is made with the direc-
tories of other large cities, and accuracy checked
by continual reference through a year’s business,
it is seen that Sands’ Sydney Directory is one of
the very first in its useful field. It does very
great credit to the industry and intelligence of its
editor and compilers. This year it is further
strengthened by ajist of N.S.W. pastoral proper-
ties, with their owners.

REPORT.
Your Directors are glad to report a continued improvement in the business of the Company during the past half-

s.ieet, as well as alterations in the form of the Auditors’ certificate and the balance-sheet itself, which are all required
by the Companies Act Amendment Act 1896. This Act also requires a statement of contingent liabilities and con-
tingent assets. As in some trustee companies, notably the oldest-established—viz., those which are carrying on
operations in South Africa—the whole of the trust funds are regarded as direct liabilities, and the trust investments
ts assets, your Directors, in order to be within the provisions of the Act, have deemed it advisable to include as con-
tingencies the total amount of clients’ business, in regard to which, however, as you are aware, the Company is only
lesponsible for the proper administration. The amount remaining at credit of Profit and Loss Account and available
for distribution is £6014 9s. 7d., which the Directors recommend should be appropriated as follows : —To dividend on

A Himperial-minded person suggested that

floral wreaths to General Gordon s statue on the
anniversary of his death, which happens, y
■way, to be Natives’ Day (Jan. 26). Itw a pity
that Gladstone, or somebody else who knows
things’’about Gordon, doesn t arise and knock
the stuffing from the memory of that cranky,
psalm-singing cut-throat. '

The profits for the past half year, have been affected by the low rates of the money market, but show an improve-
ment of £2859 19s. 5d., as compared with the previous half year. After providing for the dividend to Preference

The policy of releasing the Bank’s long-dated Deposit Receipts has been followed by the Board during the half
year, with very satisfactory results. Three instalments of 10 per cent, each have now been paid off, and a fourths-is
announced for the 12th April, which will largely reduce the deposits falling due in 1899 —all earlier maturing receipts
being cleared off by this and previous payments. The Board has pleasure in stating that the money thus released has
been freely redeposited with the Bank at lower rates than it was previously bearing.
The Branch at Alberton has been closed during the half year.
The Dividend on Preference Shares will be payable in Melbourne on and after the 3rd February, and at the
branches and in London on receipt of advices.
The transfer books of the Company will be closed from the 20th inst. to the 2nd February, both days inclusive.

Dear Bulletin,— -fte your par. and the
tactics of time-payment jewellery-canvassers.
One device is to post, by registered packet, a
watch or other article—which, after some discus-
sion, has been refused —to the canvassed party
and cah a few weeks later for payment. If the
agent cannot then induce the recipient to keep the
article, he will bounce about its damaged condi-
tion, ask why in thunder it wasn't returned, and
“ perform ” generally. The London papers con-
tinually refer to, this class of house-to-house pest,
which somehow seems to have been acclimatised
here.—Yours, &c., Victim.

educated chiefly at Paris, where are the head-
quarters of the. order, and at Castleknock, the
head-quarters of the Irish province (which in-
cludes England). His experiments with the
x rays of Prof. Rontgeii have been remarkably
successful; and, working on the cabled hints, it
appears that he advanced as quickly on the path
of discovery as any European experimentalist. It
is claimed that he was first to discover the “ Tesla
effect” of the x rays, and first in Australia to
make a fluorescent screen. He works with a fine
6-inch electrical coil, soon to be superseded by a
12-inch. So far as here known, only two 12-inch
coils are at present in use for surgical purposes,
one at Vienna and one at Berlin. Several surgical
operations have already been successfully per-
formed with the aid of the x rays manipulated by
Father Slattery.
Dear Bulletin, —An ex-Victorian, who
has seen most of the N. W. Australian sheep and
sheep-stations, says that to guard against future
loss in times of drought, which are frequent in
this uncertain, sun-dried waste, he would suggest
to the squatters that a cross between their sheep
and the native bear of eastern Australia would
prove most beneficial. Firstly, it would improve
the already existing quality of the hair on their
sheep (average price of ‘ ‘ wool ” from the N. W. for
the last four years has been 4|d. per lb.). Secondly,
in times of drought like the present (no rain for
last ten months), little or no grass being left, it
would enable the sheep to climb trees and feed on
the leaves, for surely they would have at lease two
feet with claws. The sheep now get up the trees
as far as they can, a la goat, in quest of leaves,
etc., so, with the addition of a clawed foot or two,
they would be capable of topping rather formid-
able trees. The greatest drawback to this cross
would present itself at mustering-time, when, in-
stead of horses and dogs, the squatters would have
to substitute niggers and tomahawks, in view of
which it behoves them to pay a little more atten-
tion to their already existing studs of niggers, and
see that all the offspring are trained, regardless of
color, to become useful with the tomahawk at an
early age. Another likely advantage from the
cross is that many of the lambs would not require
tailing. This matter is worth serious considera-
tion.—Yours, Mangrove, Cossack, W.A.

The Oracle ' s Cousin.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
The creature’s color? “Oh, a kind of
whitish, with ” the Wodono looked round him
for an illustration, and found one in the little
patches of sunlight cast upon the floor through the
interstices of the trellis-worlc door of his domicile.
The openings were lozenge-shaped, but the patches
of light admitted by those furthest from the
whitewood floor studded it, of course, with little
circular discs of illumination.
To these Tablan pointed. “ The extraordinary
animal,” he explained in his soft Javanese, “ was
marked exactly like that —little round spots, still
lighter, upon a lightish ground.”
The Oracle, with an incredulous smile, solemnly
shook his superior cranium.
“There is no known animal,” he pronounced,
“marked with any geometrical figure.”
“ But these,” objected the inerudite Learner,
“ are circles.”
“And isn’t the circle a geometrical figure?”
scoffed the Oracle. “Produced by a plane, pass-
ing through a cone, parallel to the base of the
cone ! ”
The Learner, after a few moments of humbled
silence, struggled out from beneath this boulder of
solid geometry with the diffident suggestion that
the creature might be something in the leopard
way.
“ Leopards have a kind of circular markings,
you know.”
The Oracle didn’t know anything of the kind.
“The leopard’s spots —but, here, Tablan—how
high do you say the thing is ? ”
The Wodono, who was about sft. high himself,
pointed to the top of his head.
“And its skull —is it like that?” The Oracle
stooped to the “harmless necessary”—rubbing
against his legs—and tapped her between the ears.
“No —like this ! ” Tablan held out his hands,
pressed palm to palm, with the thumbs sticking
up like ears.
The sun, striking strong into the hut through
the single window, flung the shadow of the
Wodono’s manual exemplification distinctly upon
a piece of white sarong stuff stretched upon the
opposite wall, and the Learner, suddenly catching
sight of the silh/mette, started, grinned, and was
grave again in an instant.
“Its tail, again, Tablan?” he asked, eagerly.
“ What did you say its tail was like ? ”
Tablan’s illustrative faculty appeared to develope
rapidly with exercise. With a rapid movement he
unfastened his conday. “ There! ” he said,
triumphantly, as the coarse, ebony-black hair
tumbled down upon his shoulders. “ That's its
tail! ”
“ I thought as much ! ” was on the Learner’s
tongue ; but, at sight of the Oracle’s supercilious
stare, he checked the exclamation, for an idea had
come to him which rendered it necessary that he
should go outside and snigger gently amongst the
penang-palms.
“ I’ve got this thing right by the handle ! ” he
said to himself ; “ and it’s just about made to order
for taking two or three storeys off our cock-a-
doodle friend’s infernal self-conceit ! I’ll get a
bulge on him to-night that he’ll never hear the end
of while he stays in Java. What’s the jackass
want now ? ”
“ I am surprised,” said the Oracle, coming out
to him ’ n the twilight, “ that you do not see the
obvious attempt to impose upon us with this pre-
posterous tale. Our credit as representatives of
the superior intelligence would suffer lamentably,
I fear, if it depended solely upon you for support. ’
ou re . < B 11 . te right, old man—-I mno equa o
the responsibility. But just you keep up your end
°f the stick as effectually as yoiive cmg c °' n o>
w ° n t matter about me. Ive a grea cea
to learn from you, I know ; but I m very wi mg,
and you ve done me a lot of good already,
* * ~ ~ ..
Now then, Tablan, the Learner said
when supper was nearly over, “ when shall we
start? There’ll be a moon, won’t there ? ” _
The moon, the Wodono explained, wouldn t be
of much use to them. There was generally a
cloak on the sky for Weeks before the beginning
of the rains. But there might be light enough to
see what they were about.
The Oracle, full of fish and self-importance, put
up an astonished monocle. “ You don’t mean to
say that, after all, you’ve profited so little by my
observations” ——
“ That I’m going to have a look for this wonder-
ful beast! Well, yes ! Mymifidssofeeble .com-
pared to yours, you see, that I can t rest satisfied
until I’ve cleared this thing up. It s a kind pf
small curiosity, you know ! ” . t( _
“ Oh, well,” the mollified Oracle admitted, I
must, of course, make allowances, for others.,
When do you expect to get back ? ;
“We? You, too, old man ! The whole thing s
beneath your notice, of course; but, if you stay
behind, it will be put down to well, to funk ! ,
“Pho! my good fellow the opinion of this old
savage ” ——
“Doesn’t matter, eh. No but the young
savage there—you don’t want her to think you a
coward, I’ll bet,” and the Learner grinned as he
pointed to Dara.
Dara was the Wodono s daughter somewhat
dumpy of figure and of feature, but. clear-skinned,
splendid-eyed, and notably espibgle. bhe laughed
when she saw the white men looking, and pointed
significantly to the Oracle’s gun. She didn’t need
to understand the language ; she read the men .
The Oracle had that temperamental weakness
which is always wondering what the other sex will
think. Also, he had made special impression, he
flattered himself, upon this plump, little, velvet-
eyed damsel m the gold-broidered head-kerchief
and snowy kabaya.
I think I had better go, after all, he said
“ just as a check upon that undisciplined lmagina-
tion of yours ! ” * « *
. . ~ „„„
A faint, diffused moonlight was strugg l g
through the clouds as the five men went down the
winding path through the sugar-cane—the W odono
and his two sons with spears and krisses—then the
white men with their rifles. Through a mango-
grove next, where the evil-smelling katunqs, nap-
ping deliriously m their faces, set the Wodono
cursing heartily over the havoc which he said
these brutes were making of his fruit-crop.
“ Also this accursed beast I have told ye of
cometh every night to destroy Ahe young rice,
The padi-fields are close at hand, and there shall
we find him. Silence now—his ears are sharp !
At the outer edge of the grove was a steep slope
from the bottom of which the rice-fields-divided
like a gigantic chess-board—stretched away m a
dead level till they were lost in the vagueness of
the night. iVlore like lakes than fields they were,
for the water, with the young rice just showing
above it, lay inches deep upon the soil as yet.
Close at hand there was a faint chattering of
bebeck-ducks ; the night wind sighed mournfully
across the watery waste ; and the Oracle—a good
deal shaken up already by his contact with the
flying foxes—shivered as the long, despairing wail
of the padi-bird arose as fearfully in the distance
as the cry of a lost spirit.
“ I think,” he said, as Tablan led the way out
upon one of the narrow intersecting embank-
ments, “ I think I will remain here. The whole
expedition is ridiculous.”
“ There’s certainly a part of it ridiculous,” the
other white man said, with contemptuous signifi-
cance. “ Stay here, then ; and don’t wander, so
that we may pick you up coming back.”
“But—but if it should come this way!—the
wild animal, I mean. ”
“Thought you didn’t believe in it! Well, you
have your rifle, haven’t you? Just ‘discipline
your imagination’ a bit, you know. Come on,
Tablan ! ”
Along the sides of the squares they went—
turning, here and there, an angle, and heading
this way and that, -till the Learner began to doubt
if he could ever regain the starting-point alone.
But to the Wodono it was apparently all plain
sailing, for, after about twenty minutes’ trotting,
he stopped suddenly at a point which had appar-
ently no special features to identify it by.
■ “ Sit, now,” he said. “This way he comes
from the jungle over there, which thou canst not
see. Get thy gun; be ready, white lord; for these
my young men fear to look upon the creature.”
The “young men,” seated on the little bank,
with their feet in the water, were obviously
enough wishing themselves well out of the busi-
ness, when their father suddenly stooped his head
to the leirel of his knees. “Listen!” he said,
and the white man. straining his ears, was just
able to catch a far-away splashing, as of some
animal slowly treading towards them through the
water. Nearer and nearer came the sound, until
the quaking of the young fellows became visible
to the naked eye, and even Tablan looked
anxiously to the white man’s gun, as the splash-
ing, after ceasing for a moment, sounded suddenly
close at hand. _
“ It has crossed the bank into the next field,”
the Wodono whispered, and the Learner—think-
ing that possibly, after all, he might have made a
mistake—felt a thrill of expectation as he stood
up with the rifle at the ready.
“Splunsh-splunsh !”—up close to the next
division, and then upon the bank, about 60 yards
away, the thing loomed shapelessly up against
the dim background of sky. Down, then, into the
water again, and steadily towards them, and still
all the white man could make out was that the
creature was large and of white color, until, hav-
ing probably winded them, it stopped and
straightened up' a longish neck to look round,
Keenly the Learner peered for a moment before
he threw up the rifle—fired—and burst into a guf-
faw as the terrible beast—uttering the noise which
Tablan had described as “like unto a man laugh-
ing ’’—splashed suddenly round—made half-a-
dozen bounds to the nearest bank—popped over it
like a hurdle-racer—and went away on the other
side with a rythmic pounding of the water that
could only have come from an animal with which
the Learner was already well-acquainted.
The Oracle was not w r here they had left
him, but at the hut they found him —hysterically
full of the fact that the terrible animal had
rushed past him at a tremendous pace, though, by
great good luck, it hadn’t caught sight of him.
“ What did you see of it ? ” the Learner asked.
“Nothing, except that it was of a lightish color
and had a longish neck.”
“ Just so ! Well, come along and show us where
it passed you. We’ll bring a couple of damar-
torches and have a look at the footprints.”
“No ! —no ! It might come back ! ”
“No matter if it should, man! It’s an old
friend of yours ; in fact, I believe it’s your
cousin ! ”
“ This man,” said the Oracle to himself, “has
gone suddenly mad ! I never thought his intellect
was very strong ! But it is best to humor the
poor creature ! ”
* * * *
The place was soon found, and the torches
held low to the footprints—far apart and deeply
planted, as of an animal at top-speed—but still
quite unmistakeable.
“ Wh-why,” stammered the Oracle —“it was a
horse 1 ”
“ Looks like it—doesn’t it ? ”
The Oracle pored over the prints for half-a-
minute before he turned up a bewildered coun-
tenance.
“ But what did you mean by saying it was my
cousin ? ”
“The horse,” said the Learner, “is generally
considered the cousin of the ass ! ”
* « » *
“You see,” the Learner explained when
he told us the yarn, “ I had heard before about a
moke that had wandered away from the Dutch
settlement at Broik and had got up into the Liaka
country, scaring the souls out of the natives, for
they’d never seen such a creature before. A fine
dapple-grey he was ; but it wasn’t Tablan’s com-
parison of his marking to the sun-spots that gave
me the clue. It was the shadow of the old boy’s
hands, laid flat together, with the thumbs sticking
upwards for ears. It doesn’t make an aristocratic-
looking horse’s head, but it’s [remarkablygsugges-
tive of the horse’s cousin. Just put your hands
together and try ! ”

A WONDERFUL RESCUE AT MELTHAM.
A MILL MEL’S DOOM AVERTED.
[From The Huddersfield Weekly News.]
“ Meltham is ringing with it ! One of the most remarkable
things that ever came within my knowledge.” These words were
CAN ACTUALLY WALK.
spoken by a prominent
member of the Mel-
tbam Local Board to
a representative of the
Huddersfield Week-
ly News, who called
upon him to obtain
some information upon
Local Board matters.
The next words aston-
ished him even more.
“ Yes, the girl was
practically dead; she
had no use whatever
in her legs, and for I
believe six years had
been as helpless as a
child. Prior to her
illness she had worked
in the mill of Messrs.
Jonas Brook and Bro-
thers, and I and every-
one who knew her fully
believed, when we
heard three years ago
that the doctors had
given her up, that she
was doomed ; imagine,
then, our astonishment
whqn we learned about
a month ago that she
was not only in good
health and spirits, but
actually able to walk.” The reporter asked the Local Board
member if he would give him the particulars of the case. The
latter said that the girl’s name was Emma Haigh ; that she lived
at Green’s-end, Meltham. Our representative, therefore, visited
Meltham and investigated the matter, having full authority to
probe the matter and ascertain if there were any truth in the
reports that were flying about. On knocking, the door was opened
by a stout and matronly-looking woman. “Come in, sir,” she
said, and, accepting the invitation, he stepped into the home .of a
working-man, with carpeted floor, sat down on an easy long-
settle, and found himself vis-a-vis with a comely, bright-eyed
brunette of about twenty-five summers.
“Well, and how are you to-day?” said our representative.
“Oh, I’m very well, indeed,” replied Miss Haigh; and then she
gave him the facts of her case. Some seven or eight years ago
she was down with rheumatism, and for five or six weeks she was
unable to go to her work. When she had been at work about a
fortnight, her ankles and legs began to pain her, and she was
compelled to leave her work, and finally again take to her bed.
The. doctor attended her, and tried all the remedies he could think
of, but without avail, and the poor girl endured terrible pain in
her drawn-up limbs. On the advice of the doctor, her mother
took the girl to the Huddersfield Infirmary ; but, to their sorrow
and dismay, she was discharged from that institution as an incur-
able. “ Home once more, probably to die ! ” as the girl said
pathetically ; and she was put into bed, from which she did not
rise for six long and weary years—years of anguish and suffering
which only those who have suffered the pains which follow in the
train of rheumatism have any conception of. Her parents tried
everything they could get, and she swallowed gallons of one kind
of medicine and another, but all to no purpose. One day her
brother came in in a very excited way, and said that he believed
he had found something which would cure her ; and as he spoke
he produced a copy of the Weekly News, and pointed out an
article headed “ Narrow Escape of a Holmfirth Girl.” The brother
read the article aloud, and as he went on Miss Haigh said she
found that the case was a similar one to hers, and hope rose high
in her breast that once more, by the medium of the specific men-
tioned therein (Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills- for Pale People), she
might be able to walk out and breathe the fresh air of heaven.
The mother, nearly as excited as her daughter, almost flew to the
chemist and asked for some of the Pills. Before the first box was
finished, Miss Haigh said she felt a change coming over her, and
by the time she had taken four boxes she could sit up in bed and
dress her own hair. Two more boxes, and she was able to get up,
dress, and walk about the floor with the aid of crutches; “and
now, look here,” said Miss Haigh, and she got up from her chair
and walked sprightly across the floor.
“My heart jumped into my mouth,” said the mother, with
glistening eyes ; and can you wonder, when I saw her as she is
arK ] k n, ’ n '' that it is through the instrumentality of Dr.
Williams Pmk Pills that she is able to walk, that I feel so happy
and grateful to him.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured numerous cases of paralysis,
locomotor ataxy, spinal disease, rheumatism, and sciatica; also of
diseases arising from impoverishment and vitiated humors of the
blood, which cause scrofula, rickets, chronic erysipelas, consumption
of the bowels and lungs, anaemia, pale and sallow complexion,
general muscular weakness, loss of appetite, palpitations, pains in
the back, nervous headache, early decay, all forms of female
weakness and hysteria. These Pills are not purgative.

After the Mood .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Here, in this bend of the creek, in the rushes and
long lush grasses,
Wild white violets nestle, and musk in the
water-weeds;
Here there is stillness, and shelter—for the wander-
ing wind as it passes
Is caught by the tall green flax, and dies in the
raupo and reeds.
Only the roar of the creek, half-hidden in flax and
toi,
Swirling in deep, dark pools under the nigger-
head,
Only the bleat of sheep, and the distant drover’s
cooee,
Only the bark of dogs, to break the sleep of the
dead !
Shelter, and stillness, else; and over the level
plain,
Over the hedges and homesteads, and paddocks
of wheat and rye,
Shoulder and peak and glacier, range upon range
again,
Blue rise the Alps in the distance, kissing the
soft blue sky.
This is the place where we found him—here, with
his face to the skies,
Cast by the furious flood like a broken straw on
the bank;
Here at the pitiless sun he stared with unseeing
eyes—
Neither despairing nor pleading, but horribly,
hopelessly blank.
Snow? we had plenty of snow that winter of
seventy-one:
Snow on the lowlands, and snow on the high-
lands, and snow on the range ;
Never a month of spring, for all with a rush and
a run,
Winter changed into summer —folk called it a
cursed change:
For a warm nor’easter blew the whole of a windy
week,
Melted the Alpine snows, and after a day of
doubt,
We woke in the noisy night to the rush and roar
of the creek —
Woke in the wild, wet night to know that the
floods were out.
We in the homestead watched, after that weary
night,
Waited and watched through the day while the
water rose to the door ;
Watched, while the children shouted, and wel-
comed the flood with delight—
Sailed their paper-boats, and paddled about on
the floor.
On rushed the yellow flood, crashing, and dashing,
and hurling
Timber, and logs, and posts, in the whirl of the
foaming deep,
Then, as the day wore on, we heard thro’ the roar
of the swirling,
Piteous, the low of cattle, and terrified bleat of
sheep.
Then, when the flood went down, the road and
the paddocks were strewn
With timber and broken branches, half-buried
in silt and mud;
Carcases hither and thither, palings and posts torn
down,
And the wild flowers crushed and broken to
trace the course of the flood.
This is the place where he lay with his wan, white
face to the skies,
Caught here against a gorse-stump amongst the
reeds on the bank ;
Here to the pitiless sun he stared with unseeing
eyes, .
Neither despairing nor pleading, but horribly,
hopelessly blank.
And here we stood in silence, the shepherd Jim
and I
Stood, and stared at the stillness in the staring
face of the dead;
And Jim knelt down in the rushes, and closed the
expressionless eye,
And covered the corpse with his coat —“For the
sake of the mother,” he said.
Only a pipe in his pocket, and matches sodden
and damp;
Never a mark nor sign to trace him, his home,
or his name;
“ Only a swagger,” we heard, and nobody misses
a tramp
Houseless and friendless—who cared whither he
went or came ?
We buried him here where we found him, for the
parson was miles away,
While the wild wind rustled the flax-blades, and
gorse-blossoms scented the air ;
Here, with the drooping wild-flowers, that glorious
sweet spring day,
We left the nameless swagger, with never a
dirge nor prayer.
Gentleman, swagger, clown what difference
perishing thus ? *
In the face of the pitiful present, what were the
things of the past ?
Gentle or simple—what matter? it was nothing
to him or to us,
We are all of us gentle, maybe, and simple too,
at the last!
What were the odds to him ? Did it fare with him
better or worse.
Rolled like a log down the creek, choked by the
fierce yellow wave,
Flung in the ooze on the bank, caught in a snag
of the gorse, '
Laid by ungentle hands away in a nameless
grave ?
Yet the shepherd Jim and I had looked on the
face of the dead,—
Looked on the dogged jaw, and forehead solid
and square:
There was will in the resolute mouth, and brain in
the massive head—
Drowned like a rat in the creek, and that powe.-
and intellect there !
And somewhere, out in the distance, was there a
mother or wife
Waiting, and watching, and praying, as only
women can pray ;
Waiting, and watching, and praying in vain for
a wasted life,
For that unknown tramp who perished—how
many miles away ?
What was the good of it all ?—of intellect, power,
and strength ?
What had he done with his life? Why was he
born to the world ?
What was the use of it all?—to live for a space,
and at length ,
Lie like a log in the mud where the refuse and
rubbish are hurled ?
Ay, you may weep and pray, you women, and
weep again,
Weep for the wasted talent, weep for the useless
The whole wide world weeps with you, the whole
world’s tears are vain
Even as yours, O Mother! even as yours, O
Wife !
We plod through the daily routine, we see in our
own dull way (
That our useless lives are useful m the life ot
the human race; .
Our influence lasts for ever, our virtues and vices
may
Bear fruit in our children’s children, and set
them each in his place.
Oh, answerless riddle of riddles ! as the purpose-
less years rolled by
We also have vexed our souls since the human
epoch began,
Who live, eat, drink, and are merry, who suffer,
and sin, and die,
Content to be amongst many—then how for the
hundredth man ?
The man who should rise and lead us, the many,
the common crowd,
Who should leave his mark upon us by right of
a powerfuller brain ;
The man who, with broader thought and higher
feeling endowed,
Was—only an unknown swagger, whose exist-
ence was void and vain !
Ah, well! let him sleep in peace where the water-
weeds and the mosses
Nestle under the raupo in the quiet bend of the
cr©ok *
Life is a difficult thing with its longings, its loves,
and its losses;
May Death prove an easier matter to all of us,
strong or weak !
M.L.
DORA WILCOX.
A Patch from a Western Canvas.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Keep your eyes on that old fellow with the three
spears,” said Tom Oscott (alias Coen Tom),
“and be ready to drop one or two if they dart
away.” But the nigs, stood in a cluster and did
not attempt to break away. Some of the gins
still carried items of spoil from the looted camp,
though for the most part these had been thrown
away in the short flight from the dispersers. The
adults kept up a constant chattering ; the pican-
ninies clung round the bare legs of their mothers
and chattered in louder and shriller key.
“Holy Joe,” whose father, it was said, was a
parson in some little Welsh village, entered a
protest. “ Only one or two —just to frighten
them,” he said; “that will be enough to teach
them a lesson.”
“Yes, we’ll teach them a lesson, don t fret,
said Tom. Now, then, chaps— all ready . ”
There was an almost instantaneous crack of four
Winchesters and a Martini. Jack’s horse, which
would not stand fire, reared on its hind legs like a
volunteer field-officer’s charger, and Jack dropped
his gun unceremoniously and hung on. There
were yells from the natives. One of them had
dropped bis spears and was staggering hither and
S3E? with his hands on his stomach like a boy
who had been kicked at football. Iwo orner
wero dovvn. gcattered kke a gW arm of flies. The
fun began. Tom galloped after one lot of*b"»T
a man and a woman and a boy , ma ’ ( j eo ff
dently members of the same family ‘ rlb
in the direction of a patch of cork-bark scru .
The boy lagged behind, hesitating, and got m the
wav of the horse, which went over him, and left
him lying still. The man and the gin reached the
sc b There were three shots, and presently
Tom rode back, pushing fresh cartridges into the
magazine of his Winchester. Mick O Gee and
Scot tv Binks who had also been doing some
shooting, returned from different directions to the
spot whence the mob had scattered and all dis-
mounted and sat under the scanty shade of a
salmon-tree. There was one captive, a gin, who,
sullen and badly scared, said nothing.
Tom wanted it to be target practice, but O Gee
objected. “This is old Mary,” he said, “that put
me on to the gnamma hole out back of Dooley s
find—and if you shoot her I’ll be inclined to drop
y °Tom was annoyed at this consideration for a
nigger, and said so ; but the rest deprecated quar-
rellfng over such a trifle. So Tom madeanother
proposal, to which O’Gee could offer no objection.
Tom led the gin a few hundred yards away
behind a screen of cork-bark bushes, and she lay
down. Then he put his heavy foot upon her neck
and pressed. Her eyeballs started from her head,
and hoarse, inarticulate cries came from her
throat; her body writhed and struggled like a
kangaroo on which a dog has fastened, and her
hands tore spasmodically and with deadly earnest-
ness at the foot which was crushing out her life.
Meanwhile Tom had lifted a large stone, and
poising it above his head for an instant, dashed it
downward with all his strength The skull
cracked like an eggshell. The stone rolled over, skin
and blood adhering to its surface. Mary lay still.
“Where’s the gin?—got away, did she?
en “ l Wefl, she might have if I hadn’t knocked her
on the head,” answered Tom.
Q’(q ee would have pursued the enquiry, but just
then Holy Joe diverted attention. He had picked
up his gun and had cleaned it carefully from the
sand and gravel which had been scooped into the
muzzle when he had unceremoniously flung it to
the ground in order to sit his horse. He stood
alongside the salmon-tree, having satisfied himself
that the barrel was undamaged, and, putting a
cartridge into the breach, fired at one of the
bodies of the niggers who had been killed by the
first shot—about 80yds. away. The body heaved
slightly and the dust flew up on the other side,
showing that the missile had passed through.
“ You fool,” said Tom, cutting short
O’Gee’s enquiry, “ and cartridges worth 6d. each.
Why the don’t you shoot at live ones when
you would be doing some good, instead of plugging
dead niggers ! ”
