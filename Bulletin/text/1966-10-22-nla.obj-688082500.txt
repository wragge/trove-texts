ONE OF A SERIES
Yalumba’s own vineyards in the Eden Valley district are
situated high in the folds of the Barossa Ranges, some
1,600 feet above the Adelaide plains. This is the most
elevated wine producing area in Australia. The prevailing
cool conditions, ideal soil, equable rainfall and climate,
produce the Rhine Riesling Grapes which are used
exclusively for making the famous Medal-winning Yalumba
“Carte d’Or Riesling”.
YALUMBA CELLARMASTER SUGGESTS
YALUMBA CARTE d’OR
A vintage wine made solely from Rhine
Riesling Grapes grown in Angaston,
Eden Valley and Springton areas,
picked and fermented in the year
shown on the label. Yalumba Carte
d’Or is bottled while young, mainly
in August/September of the vintage
year, and then carefully aged in the
age-old cellars of Yalumba. Serve cold.
YALUMBA GALWAY VINTAGE
CLARET
This renowned red table wine is
blended from two varieties of grapes
Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz
(hermitage). Cabernet Sauvignon, a
light-cropping variety, gives a wine a
full bouquet and a soft tannin, while
the wine from Shiraz grapes imparts
a soft, round, full flavour. All grapes
used are grown in the Barossa and
McLaren Vale districts, where climate,
rainfall and soil quality are ideal.
Labelled with the vintage year.

The Resha Dossier
Sir,
According to Mr. Sam Lipski (8.,
October 8) the South African Aid and
Defence Fund is satisfied that Mr.
Robert Resha is telling the truth when
he disputes charges that he is associ-
ated in any way with Communism. Mr.
Resha’s reliability as a witness can best
be tested by reference to his definite
statement, as reported in an interview
with “The Age,” Melbourne, of October
5, that the African National Congress
“is not Communist-influenced at all.”
I find it surprising and disturbing
that the South African Aid and Defence
Fund is apparently not familiar with
the following facts:
At the Rivonia trial in South Africa
Mr. Nelson Mandela admitted that he
was deputy-president of the African
National Congress, that the ANC and
the South African Communist Party co-
operated closely, and that he had
drafted the document “How to be a
good Communist.”
Giving evidence under oath at the
Rivonia trial, Mr. Walter Sisulu, former
secretary-general of the ANC, admitted
that he had travelled extensively
behind the Iron Curtain while he was
at the same time a member of the
national executive of the ANC. He
said that the ANC and the Communist
Party were closely affiliated and that
their aims were the same. Sisulu told
the court that the Communist Party had
assisted the ANC with sabotage.
Ahmed Kathrada admitted at the
Rivonia trial that he was an active
member of the banned South African
Communist Party and that he had
worked closely with the ANC. Mr.
Lionel Bernstein told the court that
he was a leading Communist, and that
the Communist Party was closely allied
with the ANC.
Much more evidence could be sub-
mitted, including the fact that Moses
Kotane had been secretary-general of
the Communist Party while at the same
time being on the national executive of
the ANC, but an examination of the
proceedings of the Rivonia trial reveals
the absolute falsity of Mr. Resha’s claim
that the ANC “is not Communist-
influenced at all.”
It will be readily agreed by Mr.

Resha’s more responsible critics that his
attendance at an international confer-
ence in Communist Cuba, attended by
t0 p Communist representatives from all
parts of the Communist world, includ-
ing China, does not make him a Com-
munist. But surely Australians have
every right to question Mr. Resha
closely on how he came to be at this
conference, and why his recorded re-
marks show that he agreed on all major
issues with the Communists? Mr.
Lipski quotes the SADAF as claiming
that the views expressed by Mr. Resha
in Cuba are “shared by many anti-
Communists.’ r If this is true, then I
submit that Australian electors are
entitled to a definite answer from Mr.
St. John, the endorsed Liberal Party
candidate for Warringah and president
of the SADAF, on the point of whether
he, who says he is a strong anti-
Communist, agrees with Mr. Resha’s
views.
ERIC D. BUTLER
Panton Hill (Vic.)
Mr. Garth Nettheim replies for
SADAF:
Sir,
The current attempt by the “radical
right” to discredit the opponents in
this country of the South African
Government’s apartheid policies —
policies which Australia has condemned
in the United Nations—has shown a
high degree of organisation and co-
ordination. Even the various references
to the South African Defence and Aid
Fund in Australia are interesting—the
South African Embassy always gets
SADAF’s name wrong!
Stage I of the campaign was the
“Stop St. John” movement (B., 24/9).
Stage 2 centred on “the Resha dossier,”
derived from the South African
security service and placed in several
sympathetic hands (B., 8/10). These
attempts to brand SADAF as a Com-
munist front, Mr. Robert Resha as a
Communist, and the African National
Congress as Communist-controlled, all
failed dismally.
Now Stage 3, “the Rivonia line,”
takes the “smear” one step further
back by alleging that the ANC is
under Communist influence. It is
voiced almost simultaneously by a cor-
respondent to the “Canberra Times”
and by Mr. Eric D. Butler (some of
whose earlier contributions to truth are
considered in K. D. Gott’s booklet,
“Voices of Hate”).
Mr. Butler’s facts consist of selected
items from the 1964 Rivonia trial, which
are taken entirely out of context, quite
apart from the question of the credi-
bility of statements made by persons
after long periods of suitable confine-
ment. Space does not permit detailed
answers here, but I recommend to Mr.
Butler that he read the full transcript
of Mandela’s evidence in which he
totally denied the allegations of Com-
munist influence.
Similar allegations had been rejected
by the judges in the Treason Trial
despite the best efforts of the Govern-
ment, over five years, to prove them.
It would indeed be quite extra-
ordinary if, in the three years from
1961 to 1964, the entire aims and
character of the ANC had so radic-
ally altered, as Mr. Butler suggests.
On the other hand, Mr. Butler should
know that South African Communists
(as Kathrada and Bernstein are said
to be) make every effort to identify
their efforts with the ANC and other
organisations, e.g., by distributing leaf-
lets purporting to come from the
ANC. (This emerged clearly in the
1965 Johannesburg Communist trials.)
Kathrada, incidentally, gave evidence
that the sabotage activity with which
he had been associated was modelled
on the wartime sabotage activities of
Mr. Vorster’s Ossewa Brandwag. Per-
haps Mr. Vorster is a Communist.
The Rivonia trial established only
one point on which the aims of the
ANC and the Communist Party were
the same, namely, the removal of white
supremacy. Similarly, as Mandela
pointed out, Britain and the U.S.A. in
World War II had shared a common
aim with the U.S.S.R. —the defeat of
Fascism. Mr. Butler’s facts do not
show that the ANC is Communist-
influenced.
SADAF is fully aware that the
ANC has received some support from
Communists, internationally as well as
within South Africa. It is even more
aware of the dangers of allowing
Africans to believe that they can expect
support only from Communists. Noth-
ing would be more likely to drive the
African nationalist movement into the
arms of Communism than Western en-
dorsement of, or indifference to, the
South African Government’s policies.
This is one reason why we invited Mr.
Resha to speak to Australian audiences.
SADAF attempts to raise money to
provide legal defence for political
prisoners and aid for their dependants.
Such money is distributed through the
International Defence and Aid Fund
for Southern Africa, which has United
Nations’ endorsement under General
Assembly resolution 1979B (XVIII).
In raising such money, SADAF finds
that it has to counter what the recently
concluded United Nations Seminar on
Apartheid described as “the inter-
national network of propaganda main-
tained with great skill and at great
cost by the Pretoria regime and by
other supporters of apartheid.” We
have seen all too clear manifestations
of such propaganda activity in these
past two months.

May I ask Sam Lipski and THE

what I and most (all we want is a fair
go, mate!) Australians are doing in
helping the Aborigine enter the affluent
society we are supposedly enjoying in
’66. Because THE BULLETIN, Lipski,
and I are doing nothing at all and
I am filled with shame because of it.

tralia was shared with half-castes, “nig-

and oh! that we could have grown up
together the same way.
What a proud race, and if Austra-
lians think they have a good sense of
“mateship,” brother, the Abos would
leave them for dead. Personally I do
not think they want to be given hand-
outs. Acceptance right along the line
is their dire need and it is only from
you and me that they will get it. Of
course they’re mistrusting, and even
Mr. Perkins admits this; but why not
when in this day and age nothing
is given for nothing? Naturally there
is mistrust on their part.
I have no right to berate my fel-
lows in your columns, but reading the
article on Charles Perkins has made
me feel so small, helpless, and angry
that we Australians have been boast-
ing to the rest of the world of our
sense of fairness to others, and yet we
tolerate this unfairness in our midst.

What Kind of Food?
Sir,
Referring to an Agrisearch article
(8., 25/6) in the first paragraph it is
postulated that the Australian con-
science should direct agricultural land
use into massive production of low-cost
foods, which presumably are grain crops
and other starches. This assumes that
the object is to provide more and more
available food to an ever-growing world
population mainly composed of people
in underdeveloped countries. This in
itself is not a bad motive, but the
trouble that poor countries have is that
animal protein is expensive and limited
in supply. The consequence of this is
by reason of a high starch diet from
babyhood, the physical and intellectual
quality of the poor in these countries
makes them inadequate for meaningful
education or concentrated work. Cer-
tainly, the tropical climate has a lot
to do with slower production, but a
more profound reason is that certain
faculties are underdeveloped by reason
of inadequate animal protein in the diet
in the formative years. In consequence,
sight, hearing, and capacity to learn
are deficient.
It would be far more altruistic for
agriculturally productive countries to
concentrate on expanding dairy pro-
ducts, which can be processed and
transported fairly easily, experimenting
with meat producing on the basis ol
quick maturing (to save costs of grazing
or feeding) in order to make available
animal protein in abundance and at
lower costs.
The alternative is, with abundance
of starch foods, to keep more and more
millions alive and producing more and
more millions with the same prospect
of just being alive, with a deteriorating
stock in capability. The only way out
pf that course will be a breakthrough
in synthesis of animal protein from
starch products, or other means.

The Eternal £ s. d .
Sir,
The Decimal Currency Board should
have been stirred into action by the
recent statement by Sir Maurice
Nathan (Chairman of Directors of
Patersons (Australia) Ltd.) that his
company and many other retailers who
gave prominence to dollars in their
advertising on “C-Day” (February 14,
1966) immediately noted buyer resist-
ance and so reverted to £ s. d. pricing.
Addressing his company’s share-
holders, Sir Maurice added, “Your
directors strongly favor decimal cur-
rency, but we cannot voluntarily alter
our present pricing policy prior to the
cut-off date for old currency in
February, 1968.”
Sir Maurice obviously is not aware
of the fact that there are no official
plans for a “cut-off” date. The simple
truth is that, for retail pricing pur-
poses, dollars, pounds, and guineas will
be usable at the discretion of the indi-
vidual retailer “ad infinitum.”
A former senior officer of the Deci-
mal Currency Board recently told me
that “it would be an infringement of
the rights of the individual if £ s. d.
advertisements were banned.” He con-
firmed my prediction that the Decimal
Currency Board plans to fade out of
the picture long before February,
1968.
Doubting Thomases should note that
Dr. N. W. Davey, the Board’s senior
officer since its inception, was recently
transferred back to the Treasury De-
partment without a whisper. Anyone
with the courage to closely examine the
officially proclaimed steady transition
to dollar retailing will soon find that
the changeover is at the point of col-
lapse.
It is time this serious problem was
faced up to properly by the business
community, otherwise we will end up
like South Africa still experimenting
in a hit-and-miss fashion five years
after their C-day.

A Nuclear Reactor
Sir,
I refer to recent articles 'in THE
BULLETIN, “An Australian Nuclear
Reactor,” by S. T. Butler, and one
by Mr. W. C. Wentworth, which sug-
gest that a unit coupled into the Snowy
Scheme could produce electricity direct
during peak loading periods, while
during off-peak periods it might be
used to pump large quantities of water
from one level to a higher level. The
energy thus stored could then be trans-
formed into electricity when desired,
via normal hydro-electric plants. This
all may be practical as long as some-
one finds the money. But the actual
value to the people of Australia would
be nil.
This country requires urgent measures
to counteract the water shortages of the
areas west of the coastal ranges. In
recent years the inland area has had
extensive droughts, costing millions of
dollars in direct loss and extensive
hardship. If one-quarter of the money
spent on the Snowy Scheme had been
spent on the northern boundary of
N.S.W., all this could have been
avoided. If a nuclear reactor is to be
built in Australia, it should be built
in the north, probably the Clarence
River highlands, with a long-wanted
dam. Power from it can then be used
to pump water over the ranges at off-
peak periods to dams west of the
ranges or fed into the river or irrigation
systems that would develop. This system
of using a nuclear reactor would be
assessed against the cost of tunnelling
from dams on the eastern side of the
ranges.
I trust that those people who have
suggested the nuclear reactor proposal
will support this alternative suggestion
as the possible way to divert water to
our inland areas.

STATE AID
86 Years Ago: October 30, 1880/.
The “S.M. Herald” is commonly
regarded as opposed to the estab-
lishment of a State religion. It may
object to the name, but, in common
with the great mass of nonconformists
in this colony, it appears to approve
of the thing. In a brief article on
Monday last, it expresses its satis-
faction at the prospect of a coalition
between the Church of England and
the Roman Catholics in Victoria, with
the view of demanding a system of
religious teaching in the State schools
satisfactory to both these influential
sects. “The Herald” points to the
educational system of this colony as
affording the model for imitation,
since “it practically meets the wants
and wishes of a large majority of
the population.” We do not think
the Victorians are likely to surrender
their existing secular scheme for one
"of a religious character, but were
they to do so it would not be the less
unjust. State religions are only pos-
sible where they “meet the wants
and wishes of a large majority of the
population.” When a majority is
opposed to a State-supported religion
in a free community, it is speedily
disestablished. The evil continues just
as long as the majority exists, unless
it be converted to principles of jus-
tice. All who disbelieve in the
religion taught, and are yet compelled
to contribute to the cost of its dis-
semination, are undergoing perse-
cution quite as galling as that against
which the Dissenters of England have
so long protested. Thus has it ever
been, however, in the dreary page
of history; persecuted sects, arrived
at their epoch of power, become
persecutors, while all the time cori-
tinuing vehemently to protest against
persecution. The Chairman of the
Congregational Union, the Rev. S.
Savage, manifested this inconsistency
most glaringly in the address delivered
by him last, week. And so oblivious
is this worthy gentleman of his own
mental condition that he can up-
braid others, and inform them that
“it indicates a lack of that manly
independence which should charac-
terise Christian men for them to be
ever dinging with a death-like grip
to the coffers of the State, begging
help from the public funds to enable
them to sustain their religious insti-
tutions.”

gathering massive aid, and the
Commonwealth agreed to pay the
freight charges. A Melbourne toy
manufacturer said he would give
15,000 toys to Vietnamese children
for Christmas. Senator Gorton said
the needs of Indonesia’s Lombok
Island were vitamins and anti-
biotics, which the World Council of
Churches was sending, but Sydney
and Canberra volunteers continued
to gather gifts of rice for shipment.
Sir Macfarlane Burnet said he was
afraid of wildcat developments in
molecular biology. An Australian
Olympic Federation select commit-
tee advocated smaller Olympic
teams of top athletes and officials.
The World Bowls championships
were held in Sydney.

signed and was replaced by Jack
Houston, MLA. Brisbane’s Lord
Mayor Jones decided to seek a third
term in office. A Melbourne magis-

Our Ally
A USTRALIA’S alliances with
our “great and powerful
friends” are so often a subject for
humbug that their deep and
abiding value risks being forgotten.
But of all these bonds with other
nations that with Lyndon Johnson’s
United States of America is now
by far the most important. Its
value lies above all in its credi-
bility: in the historical fact that it
was America around the time of
Coral Sea which provided us with
the support we needed to repel
Imperial Japan in its assault upon
us. No other country was willing or
able to come to our assistance at
that critical time and the belief that
this was not just a random gesture
is underscored by America’s inter-
national performance elsewhere
and at other times. The greatest
nation in the world has many
critics, but only the meanest in
spirit deny that it is most times
impelled by only the best of
intentions.
Naturally the touchstone of
American politics is American in-
terests, but the great virtue of them,
from the viewpoint of other free
peoples, is that they have not been
conceived narrowly. NATO, given
guts by the powerful support of the
United States, laid the foundations
for the economic miracles of
Western Europe in the 1950 s and
by thwarting Russian ambitions
created the pre-conditions for Com-
munist revisionism and the limited
reconciliation with European Com-
munism which has since eventu-
ated. In Asia in the ’sixties,
America, through its alliances with
other Pacific nations, holds the key
to whether the area is to live in
relative peace and endeavor
through diverse but pragmatic sys-
terns to modernise and progress, or
whether it is to be plunged by-
Chinese inspiration and power into
endless dirty wars, forced to revert
to the madness and inhumanity and
zealotry of the tradition of Stalin
and Mao Tse-tung. Fortunately,
America in its wisdom acted early
to contain this new Fascism of the
’sixties.
In one of his recent speeches
President Johnson said: “In the
1930 s we made our fate not by
what we did but by what we failed
to do. We propelled ourselves and
all mankind toward tragedy not by
decisiveness but by vacillation, not
by resolution but by irresolution,
not by action but by inaction.
The failure of free men in the
1930 s was not of the sword but of
the soul and there must be no
such failure in this decade. Let us
not delude ourselves again by the
belief that peace can be secured
by submissiveness or extended by
expediency. Let us not again adopt
the arrogance that peace is less im-
portant to the peoples of the less
important countries because they
are distant or different from our
own. Let us not return again to the
impulsiveness which accepts as safe
every promise of peace from the
enemies of peace and rejects as
dangerous every proposal for
strength from its friends. Perserver-
ing and patient, firmly gripping
realities, proceeding in clear aware-
ness of the dangers, let us proceed
with careful but imaginative plan-
ning necessary to assure peace and
justice and progress. This is the
course we of the United States have
chosen.”
Australia, if the comparison is
not too ridiculous, is on this course
too.


THIS AUSTRALIA
A Dangerous Precedent
A parliamentarian is entitled to say what he likes within the confines of the
Chamber of the House of Representatives or the Senate. He cannot be questioned
in any court of the land on what he says.
But is he morally entitled to take
over the function of a court of law
on other than a political issue and
publish what he says as findings with-
out the taking of evidence or any
other of the protections provided in
proceedings in a court of law?
This is the question raised by the
speech last week in the House of
Representatives by Mr. Bert James,
Labor MHR for Hunter. Mr, James is
a former member of the N.S.W. Police
Force (who can be expected to have
some appreciation of the manner in
which the law operates).
Mr. James launched grave charges.
He did not so much launch them as
make a judgment upon their accuracy.
They were not political charges. They
were charges that in normal circum-
stances would be decided by a judge
and jury. He named as involved three
persons, one as carrying on an abor-
tion operation. As I see it, a parlia-
mentarian has a public duty to see
that the course of political justice runs
pure. If there is any neglect on the
part of the police, or the administration
of justice fails in any way, the parlia-
mentarian has a responsibility to point
to that neglect and to point to cases
where the administration has failed to
take proper steps, but without himself
giving the appearance of trying them
and delivering the verdict in a public
speech. That is the job of a judge
and jury.
But as I see it, irrespective of what
he privately may feel and whatever
Bert James-serious charges.
his suspicion (suspicion is not proof
under our law but only a reason for
investigation), the parliamentarian
should not intrude into the realm of a
court.
There are a number of disturbing
angles to the whole affair. Mr. James
tried to give his speech the most
authoritative ring of which he was
capable. “I am conscious of the posi-
tiveness of my information,” he said.
“They (the three persons named) were
questioned recently. by senior investi-
gation officers . . . (they) were from
the Criminal Investigation Branch.”
The whole implication is that the
information was conveyed to Mr.
James from police sources. In fairness
to Mr. James, it must be presumed
that the information came from
authoritative police sources, and was
not something he picked up in idle
gossip with former colleagues. Police-
men are only human. They have the
same faults and defects that the rest
of humanity have. I have no doubt
that they “leak” what they consider
interesting items of information about
their police work to trusted friends
and associates, No man, even a Cabinet
Minister, who has the responsibility
of keeping high State secrets, is with-
out confidantes. But if the material
upon which Mr. James based his
speech in the House of Representatives
last week was “leaked” for the de-
liberate purpose of having the material
presented to the Parliament, then
(whatever the ultimate outcome) a
dangerous precedent has been estab-
lished.
The police should not use politics
as an instrument for their investiga-
tions. If they do they overturn the
whole system of British justice. And
the malaise could go even deeper.
When the police start to use poli-
ticians it is only a matter of time
before the politicians start to use the
police, and when the police, instead
of administering the laws made by the
lawmakers, are told by the lawmakers
what to do, there ends liberty.
Irrespective of the outcome of the
affair that Mr. James has started, there
is a principle of restraint that the legis-
lators have operated under for a long
time. It is that while they have com-
plete freedom of speech within the
chambers of the Parliament they
should not use that freedom to inter-
fere with the normal course of justice,
a principle threatened by speeches of
the type Mr. James made. Without in
any way circumscribing the complete
freedom of speech that parliamen-
tarians have, Parliament might well
pass a sober, carefully stated resolu-
tion on this subject. For the principle
here is so large that it would seem to
outweigh the happening of the speech.
ALAN REID
Build-up
The defence build-up initiated two
years ago in November, 1964, is getting
under way, according to the Annual
Defence Report released in Canberra
last week.
The number of full-timers in the
armed forces rose by 15 percent to
68,500 during the year, the largest
increase since the Korean War. Of the
extra men enlisted, three-quarters went
into the Army. The importance of
National Service in attaining the higher
numbers is striking: voluntary enlist-
ments exceeded discharges by only
3000, so that almost three-quarters of
the build-up was due to conscription.
Next year is expected to see almost
as large an increase in numbers, taking
the total to almost 80,000 by June 30,
1967. The Army will have a strength
of 41,000, a solid advance on 1961’s
remarkable low of 19,878. It also com-
pares well with the Korean War level
of 27,000, though, of course, it is no
match with World War II numbers.
Mr. Calwell’s
Presence
A notice appeared on the board in
Canberra’s Press gallery last week
announcing a Press conference to be
held in Mr. Arthur Calwell’s room. It
was signed by his Press secretary, John
Maher. But it was not the Leader of the
Opposition who was intending to make
an announcement. It was Mr. Frank
Courtnay, the Labor Member of Dare-
bin, Victoria.
As Mr. Courtnay read nervously and
haltingly from a typed text, it became
apparent that out of three foolscap
pages of typed statement came only one
simple proposition about the now dead
Benson affair. In June, it appears, Cap-
tain Benson decided to resign from the
Defend Australia Committee, after a
rowdy public meeting. He discussed the
matter —in confidence, so he thought —
with several colleagues, and showed
them a letter he had written to the
secretary of the committee in which he
offered his resignation. He later
changed his mind. So what? Why the
Press conference? Why this late attempt
to revive the Benson affair? journalists
asked.
The innocent Mr. Courtnay said he
had been requested to release the state-
ment. By whom? And why? “If the
Party asks me that is good enough for
me. I have been a loyal member for
40 years.” And which official or branch
of the Party made the request? No


“I see you, Mr. Calwell.”
progress, so the attention of journalists
turned to a figure slumped deep in a
large leather chair in the comer, and
shrouded by the all-encompassing pages
of “The Age.” It was none other than
the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Cal-
well, himself.
Had Mr. Calwell “requested” Mr.
Courtnay make the statement? Parry-
ing the question once, Mr. Calwell was
soon asked again and replied that he
was “an invisible presence.” Mr. John
Bennetts of “The Age” said: “But Mr.
Calwell, I can see you and I would like
to put the question to you again.” All
to no avail. The Leader of the Opposi-
tion refused to deny or confirm that it
was his little show, although who could
not go away guessing that it was.
After all, Mr. Calwell had himself
gone out of his way two days earlier to
make an attack on Benson. So the only
conclusion to be drawn was the Labor
Leader was intent on pursuing to the
end the expelled Benson. Benson him-
self said he had no doubt that Mr.
Calwell masterminded the performance.
And he pointed out just two hours later
Mr. Calwell was on his feet trying to
prevent a question being asked about
Mr. William Morrow, Stalin Prize
Winner, and currently in China making
obeisances to the thought of Mao Tse-
tung. In the Labor Party, said Benson,
“you are entitled to consort with Com-
munists, but if you deal with non-
Communists —finis.”
At the very same time, Mr. Harold
Holt was putting on a somewhat dif-
ferent performance. Three hundred
yards away in the main dining-room of
the Canberra Hotel he was quietly mak-
ing his presence felt at the annual meet-
ing of the Liberal Party’s Federal
Council still closed to the Press. Fie
smoothly talked the Queensland divi-
sion into withdrawing a motion calling
on the Government to abandon sanc-
tions against Rhodesia and resume dip-
lomatic relations with the Smith
Regime.
Most of the time, as usual, was spent
on mundane matters, such as the propo-
sal to put clocks forward half an hour
in South Australia so that their time is
the same as Eastern Standard Time.
But Mr. Holt was decisive in the other
important contest, over the role of the
Young Liberals. This movement, which
has grown so rapidly—until it now
numbers nearly 10,000 —and which has
been given responsibility for the Liberal
campaigning in a number of key seats,
is demanding more power.
The Federal Council agreed willingly
to formalise the Young Liberals’ Liaison
Committee, giving them greater access
to the party machinery, but there was
considerable resistance to the demand
for a place on the Federal Executive. A
senior Cabinet minister argued that the
Council should not go along on the
second proposal leaving it until the
Liaison Committee had proven itself.
It looked as if he had the meeting his
way, but Mr. Holt argued tactfully
against him. The motion was won, just
getting the requisite three-fifths
majority.
PETER SAMUEL
Political
Teachers
The virtues of silence in political
strategy are underestimated by pro-
Communist and Left Wing activists.
Consider a case in the Victorian
Teachers’ Union.
A month ago THE BULLETIN re-
ported that a new publication with the
unlikely name of “Progressive
Teacher” had been launched in Mel-
bourne and that it gave a well-
documented account of Communist
strategy in Australian teaching unions.
Since then, “Progressive Teacher” No.
2 has been published and distributed
to schools and teachers in Victoria. It
contains further documentation of
Communist plans to capture the Vic-
torian Teachers’ Union, link up with
overseas Communist-front teachers’
organisations, sponsor phony peace
organisations, etc., and points out that
apart from political consequences the
Communist capture of the union would
be disastrous for the cause of educa-
tional reform because it would supply
the Victorian State Government with
a ready excuse for ignoring legitimate
teachers’ union demands.
JTACED with documentary exposure,
the best tactic for the teaching
organisations in which Communists have
influence should have been to follow
the advice of Uncle Remus and lie
low and say nothing. However, there
is a compulsive aspect to the reactions
of the Leftist branches of the teaching
unions which makes it difficult for
them to avoid the traps.
The latest issue of the “Teachers’
Journal” contains a full report of a
debate on the Victorian Teachers’
Union Council and quotes attacks on
the publication. Part of a successfully
proposed motion reads: “The VTU
condemns the undeclared members of
the Progressive Teachers’ Association
for their interference in the internal
affairs of the VTU and resents their
attempts to disrupt union affairs by the
introduction of party politics.”
The introduction of party politics is,
of course, precisely what the “Progres-
sive Teacher” documents and com-
plains about, but the Progressive
Teachers’ Association could scarcely
have expected such fast and broad pub-
licity for their campaign. Heated de-
bate in the council chambers and a
page and a half in the “Teachers’
Journal” must have been rather
more advertising than anyone . had
hoped for at such an early stage.
More promotion was to follow, and
of such a kind that it reinforced the
charges in the “Progressive Teacher.”
The latest issue of the VTU “Techni-
cal School News Bulletin” features the
front page headline: “Progressive
Teachers or Fascists Anonymous.”
There is no mistaking the source of
the language of the attack which fol-
lows: “When groups of activists . . .
set about to achieve changes and im-
provements, we find small extremist
sections of the community . . . ready
to group all activities as pro-
Communist dupes . . .
“Familiar formula? Substitute ‘Jews’
for ‘Activists,’ ‘Nazis’ for ‘Extremists’
and we have the tried and proven
formula of the Third Reich and its
fanatical leaders Goebbels and Hitler.”
And so on. In old familiar style, the

"Why do you believe he exists? Can you see him? Touch him? Feel him?"
Radio News
Radio listeners might soon be asked
to nominate their likes and needs from
the industry. This was the somewhat
surprising suggestion put forward last
week by the Chairman of the Broad-
casting Control Board, Mr. Myles
Wright, at the 36th Convention of the
Federation of Australian Commercial
Broadcasters in Melbourne.
Mr. Wright said that the Control
Board, the federation, and the ABC
should combine to do research on what
the public wants to hear. He pointed
out that, while present research is con-
fined to head-counting the ratings
system and little or nothing else,
programming must continue to be in-
bred. “The things that are popular
are done more so as to appeal to a
majority whose numbers tend to fall
as increasing concentration on the most
popular cloys the palate. Commercial
broadcasting is too big, too influential;
to allow itself to be side-tracked into
that kind of follow-my-leader exercise.”
He did not see it as competitive re-
search. It would simply provide what
he called “a background of fact, a
knowledge of your public” that could be
used competitively in program plan-
ning. Otherwise, typical of a now
prosperous and growing industry, the
convention yielded little that was out
of the ordinary. The federation presi-
dent, Mr. A. D. Faulkner, pointed out
that new commercial radio stations
would soon be operating at Surfers
Paradise, in the Innisfail-Tully area,
and on the Atherton Tableland. In the
three years to last December, the aver-
age increase in sets in the nation was
58 percent. Commercial stations catch
83 percent of the country’s listening
ears and “No less than 90 percent of
people over 10 years of age listen to
commercial radio at least once in every
week.” Rather blunting the new point
made by Mr. Wright, he went on:
“Commercial radio is fulfilling a public
need, it is broadcasting what the public
wants and in doing so is providing
social amenities and service.”
The Postmaster-General, Mr. Hulme,
again laid down quite firmly that the
Government had no intention of intro-
ducing FM broadcasting “in the fore-
seeable future.” He assured the con-
vention that the recent decision to
grant licences for FM experimental
purposes should not be taken as any
prelude to a reversal of the Govern-
ment’s attitude.
He went on to point up just how
radio by now seems to have got over the
hurdle of television competition that it
was struggling with up to a few years
ago. Radio licences now total more than
2i million. Average transmission hours
of metropolitan stations are now 153
weekly.
But apart from the’ possibility of
listeners being courted by being asked
what they would like to hear, only one
new development in commercial radio is
definitely on the horizon. The Govern-
ment has relaxed its prohibition on the
recording of telephone conversations
for broadcasting. Following its success
in America, Australian broadcasters
have been keen to follow into this field
but have been balked by the long-
standing PMG rule against phone con-
versations being recorded. Some stations
have edged around this by using con-
versations or comments that they insisted
could be classified as news-type broad-
casting something for which phones
may be used. Now the ban is being lifted
as long as the recording unit gives out
a distinctive signal every 15 seconds that
indicates to the person at the other
end that the conversation is being re-
corded. For on-air presentation, these
signals can be filtered out again.

Practically no one takes any notice
of massive propaganda campaigns
aimed at weaning people away from
smoking. This is the conclusion of a
survey released in Melbourne last
wee k*
Dr. R. C. S. Trahair, an assistant
lecturer in social psychology at Mel-
bourne University, who conducted the
survey for the Anti-Cancer Council of
Victoria, ended up advising them to
drop their anti-smoking campaigns and,
instead, look into the reasons why
people smoke. “Despite all the years
people have been smoking, the real
reasons why they do it are things we
know practically nothing about.”
i n t h e United States, as here, con-
sumption of cigarettes has continued to
increase yearly despite periodic health
reports and campaigns aimed at curb-
ing it. Even the startling U.S. Surgeon-
General’s report of January, 1964, was
not followed by any cut-down there
or here.
Dr. Trahair’s survey was done over
three years and quizzed a total of 821
people in a cross-section of the com-
munity, concentrating on such high,
medium, and low-income suburbs as
Kew, South Yarra, Carlton, North Mel-
bourne, and South Melbourne. About
85 percent said that they believed re-
ports about the health hazards in smok-
ing, yet only ten percent of those who
had given up smoking said they had
done so because of the medical re-
ports. More gave it up because of per-
sonal physical discomfort it was caus-
ing them a cough, headache,
nausea, because of pregnancy—or just
because they felt better without it. Some
gave it up under pressure from their
spouses or families. But, in all, only 129
—or 16 percent of the sampling—were
past smokers.
Throughout the survey the smokers
volunteered three periods in their daily
lives when they smoked most: on social
occasions; in situations when tension
was high; and on occasions of little
activity. The favorite time for smoking
was found to be in the evening, after
meals, and with drinks. About 60 per-
cent of smokers and non-smokers
agree that here should be some curb
placed on cigarette advertising. There
should be less persistent inducements
for young people and non-smokers to
start the habit. Most said they would
like to see glamor taken out of adver-
tising: less emphasis on the image that
all the “best people” smoke, cut out
sex appeal in the advertisements, cut
out references to sport and famous men.
Non-smokers particularly found glamor
advertising irritating. About a quarter
of the curbers wanted some form of
Government control or even a total ban
on cigarette advertising.
DR. TRAHAIR summed up: “A
large-scale anti-smoking campaign
seems inappropriate at present. Instead,
a large-scale study is needed to find how
widespread is the belief in the connec-
tion between smoking and health;
what kinds of belief systems help the
current smoker to continue smoking
while he believes he is harming his
health; how and, to a lesser extent,
why past cigarette smokers gave up
cigarettes. Answers to these questions
could provide the basis of an anti-
smoking campaign which would hot
only provide information and attack
specific belief systems, but would shew
to those people who do believe in the
connection between smoking and health
how they can give up cigarettes.”
Interestingly, on the same day as
his survey report was published there
came from Columbus, Ohio, a news
item about an insurance company there
starting to give lower insurance
premiums for non-smokers. But in-
surance companies here are less en-
thusiastic. Some have toyed with the
idea, but so far have rejected it, mainly
out of scepticism about it workability.

After Jack Duggan
Publication of the annual report of the Taxation Commissioner precipitated the
resignation of Jack Duggan, parliamentary leader of the ALP in Queensland for
nearly a decade.
Two days before the report was
tabled in the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment disclosing that Duggan had
understated his income in the years
1954-55 to 1961-62 by more than
$66,000, he tendered his resignation to
the Party Caucus, then announced his
decision to a shocked Parliament which
had been expecting his attack on the
Treasurer’s unusually tough budget.
From his statement to Parliament,
which included the text of a letter
written to the taxation authorities in
1963, and subsequent information re-
leased, it appears that over those years
Mr. Duggan was dealing substantially
in shares, but regarded himself as an
investor rather than a speculator. When
it was decided that he was liable for
taxation on many of the dealings, the
consequence was an additional taxation
liability of $34,000 plus a penalty of
$13,500, although, as he pointed out,
he had admitted sufficient of the deal-
ings to have to pay $10,200 tax over
and above that due on his parliament-
ary salary.
In his letter to the Deputy Taxation
Commissioner he referred to his own
early life: the son of a schoolteacher,
he had been orphaned at 12 and left
school early to work as a grocer’s clerk
in Toowoomba before entering State
Parliament at 25; he had begun invest-
ing in the days before the parliamen-
tarian’s superannuation scheme had
been introduced, and the nest-egg had
been intended to keep his wife and
children from the privations he had
experienced himself.
The Duggan affair is the personal
tragedy of an able man who had been
one of the two most effective members
of the Gair Government. The other,
Ted Walsh, hangs on as Independent
Member for Bundaberg, but has been
a spent force since the QLP Parliamen-
tary Party was decimated at the 1960
election. It is also the tragedy of the
self-made man who not only became a
first-class politician and perhaps the
best speaker in the House (although
his rapid-fire delivery has been the
despair of Hansard reporters and keeps
him from being the spellbinder he
might otherwise have become) but
made himself the best-read man in the
House and the only significant source of
new policies in the years that Labor
has been in opposition.
It is also a heavy blow for the ALP.
Duggan was the one member of the
Gair Government not to go with the
QLP; his long service as Minister for
Transport provided the only experi-
ence of administrative responsibilities
to which the party could point.
After the recent State election, his
deputy-leader, Eric Lloyd, was dumped
by a Caucus in which the Trades Hall
element had been reinforced; Lloyd’s
performance as deputy had left much
to be desired and his connections with
the AWU rendered him vulnerable.
He was replaced by Jack Houston, a
former schoolteacher who had won
the metropolitan seat of Bulimba from
the QLP in 1957, and Duggan did
not fight to save Lloyd—who walked
out of the Caucus meeting which
unanimously asked Duggan to stay on
as parliamentary leader after he had
tendered his resignation.
When the vacant leadership and
consequent vacancies were filled by
Caucus, the Left-wing Trades Hall
group carried off every place. For the
leadership, Houston defeated Pat Han-
lon, son of the former Premier, Ned
Hanlon, who is still fondly remem-
bered as the father of Queensland’s
free hospitalisation. Hanlon holds the
safe city seat of Baroona, and has
sometimes been criticised for not re-
turning the party enough politicking
for so safe a seat, but at 36 he is
lying well should the party ever swing
back to the right. To succeed Houston
as deputy-leader, Caucus chose Perc
Tucker, member for Townsville
North since 1960; also an industrial
Jack Duggan ALP loss.
wing man, his seat is one of the
shakiest the party holds, but it was
essential to produce a balanced ticket
between Brisbane and the rest of the
State.
The result of the change is that the
ALP’s leadership looks more leftish,
subject to Trades Hall influence, Pro-
testant and inexperienced, at a time
when the party should be girding up
its loins to hit Frank Nicklin’s suc-
cessor (almost certainly Education
Minister Jack Pizzey) before he gets
too well dug in.

Press Failure
Vietnam —the “unreported” war.
Two months ago, following my return to the United States from Vietnam, Major
General John Norton and the main body of his First Cavalry Division Air Mobile
fought an important battle in the extreme west of the Central Highlands of South
Vietnam.
The battle was remarkable for many
reasons, including the fact that it did
not make one lead headline in the
Press. The Division had been cam-
paigning for months on ground much
closer to its large fortified perimeter
next to An Khe, inland from the east
coast about 30 miles. On the Bon Song
plain next to the sea, in the hills inland
from the port of Tuy Hoa and among
the high mountains directly north-east
of its own base, its brigades had taken
on major enemy forces, exterminated
most of them, and driven the others
from the field.
Then, as August opened, the great
body of the First Cavalry was lifted
and committed more than 60 miles
westward, beyond Plei Me near the
Cambodian border, in a countryside
dominated by rugged peaks, covered
with dense jungle and rain forest, and
permeated by numerous streams. Th 6
radical switch of scene and action took
less than 12 hours. For speed and dis-
tance, there is no man movement of
troops to compare with it in military
history.
Thus began Operation Paul Revere
11, the euphemism chosen by the politi-
cal authorities to cloak this main trial-
at-arms in Vietnam. It ended on August
25, and by that time Norton had com-
mitted 14 battalions, six of them his
own, to the battle line. The statistics
of this battle are eye-opening; it was
the real whopper of the summer. The
actual body count of enemy dead was
861, which, under the conditions of
jungle warfare, with the enemy risking
fanatically to extract his slain, indicates
destruction of twice that number. Two-
hundred-and-two prisoners were cap-
tured, along with more than 300 wea-
pons, many of them crew-served. Con-
firmed as engaging on the other side
were nine specific North Vietnamese
Battalions.
So here in aggregate was a battle of
forces far larger than those at San
Juan Hill and El' Caney combined,
bigger and more impressive than Pork
Chop Hill by any measure, bloodier
than Cantigny, and lasting as long as
Belleau Wood. But no understanding of
its proportions—indeed, scarcely any
awareness of its existence, though it
involved many of their sons—was con-
veyed to the people of the United
States. Those who noted the Press re-
ports at all were entitled to the im-
pression that the cavalrymen were off
on another wild goose chase which
might, incidentally, result in some slight
drawing of blood.
Why is this so? The Army procedure
of playing down the sanguinary charac-
ter of operations in the Central High-
lands by labelling each engagement with

Face of the World
Asia: Early in the week President
Marcos, of the Philippines, con-
vener of . the coming Manila Con-
ference, said there was disagree-
ment among the seven nations pre-
paring to confront the problems of
Vietnam, and that an “honest
broker” such as Indonesia might
be needed in any peace moves.
Indonesia’s Adam Malik said this
had been suggested but without
word from the Communist side. U.S.
Defence Secretary McNamara
visited Saigon, heard pleas for
more than the present 325,000
troops, but said no immediate fur-
ther build-up seemed necessary. The
Ky Government was in danger of a
split marked by resignations. In
Singapore, nine Opposition M.P.s
resigned.
The Americas: The $58,000
million U.S. Defence Appropria-
tions Bill for 1966-67 was passed
by Congress after a three-month
delay. President Johnson conferred
with the U.S.S.R.’s Mr. Gromyko
on a nuclear non-proliferation
agreement and the U.K.’s George
Brown about Britain’s peace plan
for Vietnam, which had been put
to the United Nations. Hurricane
“Inez” petered out in Mexico after
18 days. Surveyor One was heard
from on the moon after three
months’ silence. NASA Minister
Webb said he thought the U.S.S.R.
was ahead in the moon race.
Europe: At Blackpool the British
Conservative Party began its annual
conference, with Rhodesia the likely
main issue. Britain’s trade balance
improved greatly in September when
the deficit was 14 times lower
than the average for the pre-
vious nine months. British Home
Secretary Jenkins called for higher
job opportunities for , colored
migrants. Sweden’s Nobel Peace
Prize for Medicine went to two
U.S. doctors for their cancer re-
search. Mayor Brandt, of West
Berlin, visited the Soviet Ambassa-
dor .in East Berlin. Britain offered
to leave the Gibraltar dispute with
Spain to the World Court.
Africa: South Africa told the
UN it would fight if its mandate
over South West Africa was ended.
Rhodesia reported that an African
terrorist campaign since UDI had
been a “dismal failure.” Britain gave
Rhodesia until November 30 to come
to terms or accept United Nations
intervention. Nigeria remained
racially divided, with no central
government in sight. South Africa’s
annual 150-mile horse race was
abandoned when 32 horses were
killed by a poisoner.

Let Gilbareo water engineer specialists show you how to solve
all your water treatment problems.
Conform to local government specifications.
Gilbarco will re-adjust your profit
picture by installing effluents treat-
ment and water reclarification sys-
tems designed to give you the small-
est, most efficient units for your
needs. And at the lowest installa-
tion, operating and maintenance
cost.
In addition, Gilbarco systems enable
you to meet all requirements and
regulations of applicable Authorities
regarding disposal of trade wastes.
And allow you to profitably recover
valuable minerals and chemicals
from effluent waste—as well as giv-
ing you great savings by permitting
the re-use of treated water where
volume usage is a costly item. In
fact, it can be safely said that in
many cases a Gilbarco installation
pays for itself in a very short time,
and, when capital cost is recovered,
begins to add immeasurably to your
overall profit picture.
The complete Gilbarco Water Treat-
ments Service is available to you—
for preliminary discussions on your
Broblems8 roblems—through to final installa-
,on and operational
maintenance service.
A simple telephone
call to your nearest
Gilbarco office will
bring prompt and
helpful assistance.
Two systems from
the Gilbarco range
are:
The W.E.L. 3-Stage Effluent Process
An automatic process in which floc-
culating chemicals are added to the
effluent under controlled pH condi-
tions before subsequent neutralising
and the addition of powerful sedi-
mentation agents.
This process is highly suitable for
any or the following:
• Removal of Toxic Contaminants
• Neutralisation • Settling and, if
necessary, recovery of Suspended
Solids • Recirculation of water to
the process. This is the smallest
treatment unit available. It is the
easiest and lowest cost to install,
operate and maintain. Is fully or
semi-automatic. Gives the fastest
treatment. And conforms to the
most stringent specifications of
applicable Local Authorities.
The Lubeck Process
This is an accelerated activated
sludge process which utilises the
fundamental principles of activated
sludge treatment at a high efficiency
—thereby providing maximum load-
ing at minimum capital cost.
The Lubeck Process
gives these big
advantages:
• Biological Purifi-
cation of effluents
with much smaller

can’s name is not to be blamed (though
this gentility seems naive and definitely
confuses history). It is not the duty of
the Army to function as war reporter
to the nation, conducting interviews and
writing feature stories; and in any event
official communiques seem to have
passed out of style.
Individual battles, ever the main-
stream of the fighting story in Vietnam
as in any other war, continue to be
ignored solely because the majority of
U.S. correspondents in Saigon don’t give
a damn about them. Perhaps the re-
porters are ignorant of war and do not
wish to expose their innocence, or so
fearful of the front that they cannot en-
dure the thought of staying with it. Or
perhaps they stay chained to their desks
in the wretched and rapidly-deteriora-
ting city because of managing editors
who deem any other kinds of “war”
stories more sensational, more worth
having than what happens to troops.
In any case, the overwhelming major-
ity of correspondents do not get to the
front; and in that regard, at least, the
American Press continues to be derelict
in its main responsibility.
To put it another way, there is a cyni-
cal faddishness to war reporting out of
Vietnam that contrasts diametrically
with every prior performance, including
Korea and Lebanon. Today’s average
correspondent prefers a piece that will
make people on the home front squirm
and agonise. Never before, in any war,
has there been so much concentration on
the offbeat yarn to the exclusion of a
balanced accounting of operations.
the television crews are guilty
of this attitude, though as a group,
they are quite ready to cope with battle
risks off and on, and go forward more
than others. Their trouble is they want
blood on the moon every night. It has
to be a picture of a stricken field or of
some poor wounded man mumbling as
he is littered to the waiting chopper.
The off-beat yarns fall into several
familiar patterns, none of which prom-
ises a beat any longer, though collec-
tively they are beaten to death.
Any demonstration or riot, and
especially a Buddhist demonstration-
riot, is sure-fire copy. So is the terrorist
incident within the city, even though
it merely scuttles a worn-out barge
and may have been an act of private
vengeance.
Then there is the thing-that-went-
wrong story. The same goes for the
story about soldiers dying from their
own air bombs, mortar fire, or artillery
shells. The war is being covered
primarily for all bleeding hearts and for
Senator Fulbright, who casts about for
a way to stop it by frightening and
shocking the citizenry. It is not being
reported for simple souls who would
like to know how it is being fought and
how good are the chances that the
South Vietnamese and American forces
and their allies can bring off a military
Victory.

The Fate of Ben Barka
Cymes who said at the start of the Ben Barka trial that truth can be lost
under a mountain of details have so far proved right. In the fifth week of the
trial, having watched a host of witnesses, including most heads of the French
police, official and secret, the watcher knew scarcely more about the fate of
Mehdi Ben Barka and about the circumstances of his kidnapping than he did when
the trial opened.
The six minor characters in search
of their part in the plot are still in
court. Bernier, the journalist, looks
less involved than at the beginning,
though he still occasionally shouts his
disgust at “this farce.” The two police-
men, Souchon and Voitot, having
lamented the harm they have done
to the honor of their profession, keep
quiet. El Mahi, the Moroccan, tries
to look smaller than ever. Lopez, the
“honorable correspondent” at the Orly
airport of the SDECE (the counter-
spy service) plays the part of Moliere’s
Scapin with decreasing gusto. His
superior in the secret service, M. Leroy
(alias Finville) does not know which
part to play now that he has been
clearly dropped by the establishment.
The court has had its moments of
emotion, when two lady friends of
Georges Figon, the only man who was
apparently willing to talk, proclaimed
at the bar, one with contained passion,
the other with bravado, their disbelief
in their friend’s “suicide.” There have
been moments of surprise; for instance,
when General Jacquier, head of the
SDECE at the time, declared that on
November 2 everybody knew that the
Moroccan Minister of the Interior,
General Oufkir, was involved in the
kidnapping, thus destroying the official
argument that General Oufkir was
allowed to leave the country two days
later because there were only the flim-
siest shreds of suspicion against him.
Brought up sharp by exclamations of
astonishment in the court, General
Jacquier tried to repair the damage
by adding that “only in his entourage”
everybody knew.
all, there is the impression of
watching one of those Pagnol films
about Southern France where men,
allegedly spoiling for a fight, do
nothing but shout, “Hold me or I shall
do something terrible.” One day it was
H. Tixier-Vignancour, the former presi-
dential candidate of the extreme Right
and now counsel for Lopez. M. Tixier-
Vignancour creates the feeling that he
will produce a rabbit whenever he
chooses to raise the sleeve of his robe.
Turning to Voitot, he said ominously:
“Beware, or Lopez can still make new
statements.” At the end of last week
it was the turn of Leroy to tell the
judge that he had had enough, that
he would have to talk to exculpate
himself, but that he did not want to
be rearrested for betraying secrets of
national defence. But then it always
turns out that it was all a misunder-
standing and that the accused have
nothing to say.
When Leroy appealed to him, Judge
Perez, the presiding magistrate, replied
that he should tell the truth but should
not betray hi s defence secrets. On the
face of it, the answer is judicious, but
suspicious Frenchmen say the presiding
judge did not show enough zeal in his
search for truth. The competence of
J ud g e Perez is questioned by nobody,
may have more respect for the
mighty in the hierarchy than, say, for
writers and artists (this seemed to be

minimise the scandal has grown.

allowed three minutes on television in
the first week of the trial and has
since then been relegated to sound
radio, where the competition of com-
mercial stations reduces the scope for
censorship. Similarly, readers of the
Gaullist La Nation, admittedly a rare
species, could be forgiven if they missed
the trial altogether.
If the purpose of the whole opera-
tion had been to confirm General de
Gaulle’s assertion that the participa-
tion of Frenchmen in the Ben Barka
kidnapping was “petty and subordin-
ate,” M. Pompidou and M. Frey, his
Minister of the Interior, should have
been sent to court and not allowed to
answer in the quiet of their offices a
questionnaire bowdlerised on the way
by the presiding judge. Nobody should
have been allowed to hide behind rea-
sons of State. Every effort should have
been made to prove publicly that no
Frenchman who mattered knew about
the plot before the kidnapping or inter-
fered with the course of justice after-
wards. Only thus could the doubters
he confounded.


The Style of L B J
By HENRY FAIRLIE
DURING the time that I have been
in the United States, I have
found nothing more strange or
more unattractive than the way in which
American intellectuals take pleasure in
reviling President Johnson. It is not
simply that they object to his policies
in Vietnam and the Dominican Re-
public. It is a feeling of strong personal
revulsion. “He is a slob,” one of them
said to me when I asked him why he
disliked the President so much. Others
say much the same, if less briefly.
The fault, I wish to suggest, is not
entirely President Johnson’s. There may
be much about him, as there is about
any politician, which is hard to stomach.
To put it delicately, he invites the
severest aesthetic judgments. But that is
exactly my point: I am not at all sure
that such judgments have any place in
political discussion.
The role of the intellectual in Ameri-
can political life is, of course, bewilder-
ing to an Englishman, and I find my-
self wondering how any sensitive intel-
lect can bear, without damage or
derangement, the solemn importance
which is attached to the intellectual in
the public life of this country. The
real intellectual must demur at such a
questionable exaltation.
The professor who allows himself to
become a speech-writer to a Presidential
candidate or a special assistant to a
President; the poet who allows himself
to be tempted to participate in a Pre-
sidential inauguration; the academic
economist who leaves his university to
become an ambassador: each of these
(and the examples in America could be
multiplied) I regard as a loss, with no
adequate compensating gain.
Still, I recognise that this is a national
habit, which will not be changed. The
dearly bought, and even more dearly
maintained, privacy of the intellectual
life is something for which American
intellectuals have scant regard, and on
The President as Tall Texan...
which they put a small price whenever
public prominence beckons. But this
is how they seem to want it, and I am
concerned only to point out the obvious
traps which lie in wait. For in these I
see part of the explanation of their
present disillusionment with President
Johnson.
Removed from his own discipline, no
one is more vain than the intellectual.
Precisely because his mind is able to
handle ideas with ease and excitement,
it is all to easily turned when he is
invited to discourse outside his own
field. Inside his own field, the intel-
lectual would never lay claim to omni-
science, and seldom to authority. Out-
side it, his claim to both is breathtaking.
A man who, having devoted his life to
the study of some exact historical event,
would hesitate to suggest the multiple
reasons why it occured, has no hesita-
tion in analysing the situation in Viet-
nam and predicting, say, the Viet Cong
reaction to a hypothetical situation.
That he should do so at all is bad
enough. But far worse is the fact that, in
doing so, he cannot help resorting to an
all but dishonest, and an all but con-
temptible, use of the methods he has
learned inside his discipline. I know of
few things more virtuous than the
methods of the intellectual used to a
fit purpose: it is all the greater pros-
titution, therefore, when they are em-
ployed for the purposes of largely pole-
mical debate. Professor Michael Oake-
shott has said that politics is an in-
appropriate activity for the young, not
because of their vices but because of
their virtues. Much the same is true of
the intellectual.
But his vanity leads him on; and it is
his vanity which explains why, when
he engages in public events, he is the
most easily seduced “joiner” of them
all. He will sign almost any round-robin
protest. Day by day, the stereotyped
literature of protest —“We, the under-
signed, representing the arts, human-
ities, and sciences in the United States
. . .’’—falls on to his breakfast table,
and he takes out his pen to make his
broad-minded challenge to the forces
of evil in the world, amidst the Rice
Krispies.
The most serious consequence of the
vanity of the intellectual is that he is
so pathetically flattered by power. The
politician is the most guileful of flat-
terers, the intellectual his most guileless
victim. As long as the politician can be
seen to be what he is—a trader for votes
—the intellectual does not find it dif-
ficult to remain untouched by him. But
as soon as the politician dresses himself
up in fancy clothes, glamorising his


office and his power, the intellectual
is a sucker for his favors; and the
American intellectual, it seems to me,
although one should be able to assume
he is beyond the age of consent, was
raped by President Kennedy.
At all times, and no matter who ex-
ercises it, power is ugly and brutalising:
President Kennedy was allowed to make
it appear attractive and redeeming.
Power is shoddy: President Kennedy
was allowed to glamorise it. Power is
for the aged: President Kennedy was
allowed to cast over it the magic of
youth. Power is unintellectual: Presi-
dent Kennedy was allowed to give it
intellectual excitement. Power is safe
only if it is exercised without enchant-
ment, without claim to reason, and
without pretense to virtue: President
Kennedy was allowed to endow it with
all three. Power is, no doubt, necessary:
President Kennedy was allowed to make
it seem desirable.
I have tried to be careful in this
last paragraph. I have not blamed
President Kennedy for doing, or for try-
ing to do, these things: a politician is
entitled to use every trick he knows,
and President Kennedy had the wit to
know more than most. My complaint is
that he was allowed to do them without
the intellectual reacting with wariness,
skepticism, and, ultimately, rejection.
If the intellectual is going to be fastid-
ious about politics, he should revolt, not
against President Johnson for making
politics look as beastly as it is but
against President Kennedy for making
it look gracious, for appropriating to it
virtues which it does not possess.
If they could only see it, the intellec-
tuals would realise that President John-
son has cleansed them or, at least,
given them the opportunity to cleanse
themselves. He does not make the pre-
tense that political decision is a debate
between intellectually upright ideas;
and when he does, he reassuringly
comes a cropper. He does not ask the
arts to place a garland on his head; and
when he does, it is the predictable farce
of the Festival of Arts at the White
House. He does not call intellectuals
away from their gentle pursuits; and
when he does, he gains the services of
only very rum intellectuals indeed. The
intellectual is on his own again, and
it is to me a tragedy that he should
react by pining again for political en-
chantment.
Intellectuals (and poets and artists)
should realise that President Johnson
has mercifully released them from the
feeling that they owe the state a due,
and one may even believe that the
editor of the “New Republic” is safe
from exile to New Delhi. For the
intellectual, of course, cannot easily
apprehend politics, and anything which
tempts him to believe that he can make
sense either of the political process or
in the political process is dangerous
both to him and to the politician, but
above all to the desirable communica-
tion between them. I cannot see how
this communication can fruitfully take
place unless both observe some fitness
in their roles, acknowledge the limits
of their own fields, and use, with pre-
cision, their own methods and instru-
ments without borrowing each other’s.
Only in this way can the exchange
between them be illuminating. To put
it another way, if the intellectual wishes
to engage himself directly in the politi-
cal process, he can only do it as Mr.
McGeorge Bundy has done, by ceasing
to be an intellectual, as such, and be-
coming a politician, as such. The dif-
ference was seen
brilliantly in Mr.
Bundy’s annihila-
tion of Professor
Hans J. Morgen-
thau during the
CBS teach-in.
The sternest
axiom which a
politician must
obey is that he
must not be tempt-
ed into seizing im-
aginary initiatives:
the intellectual
temperamen tally
believes that the
opportunity for
them is always
there. The sternest
obligation of a poli-
tician is that he
must live with
problems that he
cannot solve, and
must handle them
without necessarily
seeking a solution: temperamentally, the
intellectual cannot bear a problem that
is incapable of solution. The sternest
rule which a politician must observe is
that he is not acting for the future, for
history, but simply for today: the in-
tellectual temperamentally gazes into
the future forward into history.
The raw materials with which a
politician in a free State must work are
usually intractable: interests which con-
flict, and are hard to reconcile; wills
which he cannot command, but at best
only persuade; resources which are
limited, and on which the claims are
manifold; support which must be
weighed and reweighed, and may at
any time wither away; problems whose
nature can only be dimly, usually in-
tuitively, perceived, but of which he
must dispose, even if in ignorance. He
is a painter who cannot mix his own
paints; a potter who cannot choose his
own clay; a composer who must score
for a brass band what he had perhaps
intended for a string quartet. That is
the measure of his art.
That President Johnson is a great
practitioner of the art is hardly denied:
then why not look at him, as such;
...and as a friend.
and, if one wishes, dispute with him, as
such? But this is precisely the quandary
in which the intellectual finds himself,
for he is lost (as he should be lost) in
the art of politics. “The American
liberal,” a Negro lawyer who works on
Capitol Hill said to me, “is more in-
terested in style than in substance”;
and, again and again, American liberal
intellectuals have asked me about the
“style” of Mr. Harold Wilson, and
complained in turn about the “style” of
President Johnson. This aestheticism is
not only quite irrelevant to politics;
it reduces the real impact which the in-
tellectual could, and should, have in
political debate. It sharpens the edge
of his criticism; it blunts the point of
his attack.
Whether President Johnson is a
“slob” or not is not really of interest,
for he is a supreme
political artist, bril-
liant (at least this
will be conceded)
in the proper politi-
cal arts of flatter-
ing, cajoling, bar-
tering, bribing,,
purchasing, intim-
idating, and (if
necessary) tramp-
ling. But these are
precisely the arts
which the intellec-
ual cannot employ
in return and, con-
sequently, if he en-
gages directly in
day-to-day political
issues, he usually
misses the target.
First, the intel-
lectual is seldom
able to understand
the nature of a
political decision.
When Mr. Attlee’s
Cabinet had to consider whether
Turkey should be allowed to become a
member of NATO, the discussion went
round the table, and every possible
political, economic, and strategic argu-
ment was put forward, especially by
Aneurin Bevan. At last the moment
came for Mr. Attlee to “collect the
voices.” (In the tradition of British
Prime Ministers, he had until then
been silent.) “Fought against the Turks
at Gallipoli,” he snapped. “Would
rather have them on our side than the
enemy’s. We’ll have them in.”
That is, almost perfectly illustrated,
political decision; and it amazes me
how American intellectuals today go
around shocking each other with stories
about, say, how the decision to inter-
vene in the Dominican Republic was
taken. After twenty years of watching
politics fairly closely, it would not
in the least surprise me if I were told
that it had been taken for an even
more outlandish reason than Mr. Att-
lee gave to his Cabinet—or even that
it was not, in any rational sense,
“taken” at all.
“I am not sure that there is really
such a thing as ‘power’ or ‘decision’,”


At Princeton University...
one of Britain’s greatest Prime Ministers
said to me, when I was talking to him
at the end of his career. “I would cer-
tainly find it very hard to give you an
example of when I have ever exercised
power or taken a decision. Of course,
I will try to make it all look very
different in my memoirs: and, if I am
lucky, part of my version will be
accepted by historians, and then I will
be called a great statesman. But it
all happens very differently. For one
thing, there is just a build-up of big
and small events, of big and small
factors, and they may not be brought
to your notice until the issue has al-
ready been decided; and, when you
eventually have to decide, it may be
in response to the smallest of them
all. That is not ‘power’ or ‘decision’;
you are too much in the hands of
events. For another thing, the in-tray
is always full. That is what politics is:
trying to empty the in-tray.”
I have listened to many descriptions
of how President Johnson is supposed
to take decisions—“He is ego-blocked,
but not ego-distorted,” was the quite
solemn comment of one intellectual of
renown—and I am left with the im-
pression that he takes them for exactly
the same reasons of personal and party
interest, of political pressure and the
pressure of events, as does any politi-
cian. If intellectuals could only forget
his “style” (which, I remember saying
when I first observed him in the flesh
at a Press conference, is really that of
a Texas Macmillan), they might have
more time to consider the substance of
'the interests and pressures to which —
quite legitimately • he reacts.
The American intellectual might cer-
tainly ask himself whether much of his
disdain for President Johnson’s manner
is not the result of a rather questionable
hankering after the patrician in politics.
After all, the Americans maintain a
political system which gives a terrible
advantage to wealth—the role which
wealth played in President Kennedy’s
campaign for the nomination is, to
an outsider, frightening and it is,
therefore, quite understandable to find
the wealth and background of, say, the
Roosevelts, Kennedys, and Rockefellers
more bearable than the wealth and
background of the Johnsons. But the
motives, to say the least, are mixed, and
I am not sure that it is healthy that the
relationship between wealth and power
in this country should be made to look
congenial simply by a patrician manner.
At least the “style” of President Johnson
enables one to see it for what it is.
Secondly, the intellectual imports
into current political issues ideas which,
although valuable in themselves, cannot
be -entertained in day-to-day politics.
It is part of his temperament he
finds power exciting, and that he is
especially excited by the idea of vast
and subterranean forces which are at
work, implacably holding mankind in
their grip. This is one reason, as has
often been remarked, why he falls
(usually on his face) for any “con-
spiracy” view of politics, or any grand
theory of “historical inevitability,”
which happens to be going the rounds.
It is an intolerable idea that any
politician should abandon the present to
the inscrutable future, that he should
abandon present commitments to the
obscure possibilty that they may be-
come insupportable, that he should
abandon present opportunities to the
dark fear that the situation may be
worse tomorrow. You never can tell
what tomorrow may bring. Winston
Churchill, if he had surrendered the
present to the future in 1940, would
have surrendered Britain, too: the
future, at the time, seemed all too
clear. But he lived and acted, during
those months, entirely in the present.
Today, he said, is enough: and, when
each new today came, we were still
there.
Again, it is a common intellectual fas-
cination to imagine that there is such
a thing as the real national interest.
This, certainly, is the claim made
sometimes explicitly, always implicitly
—by Mr. Walter Lippmann in his
present criticisms of the administration’s
policies. He claims, moreover, not only
that there is such a thing as America’s
real national interest (which is doubt-
ful) but that it can be discovered
(which is certainly untrue) and that the
politician should make it his business
to discover it and obey it (which is
alarming).
To concede that the politician can
and should discover the real national
interest is to concede, also, that he may
have discovered it, and therefore to
leave no philosophical justification for
questioning his actions. It is the claim
made by all dictators, and there has
always been, in Mr. Lippmann’s poli-
tical philosophy, this strong pull to-
ward authoritarianism, toward the idea
that there are some who know best
what is good for the nation, the people,,
at large.
But this is not the immediate point.
The fact is that the politician cannot
be concerned with the “real” national
interest, because he is bound to deal
with observable facts. The idea of a real
national interest is a metaphysical con-
cept —useful to the intellectual as an in-
strument, but, as has been proved by
several million deaths over the past
hundred and fifty years, dangerous if
taken literally —which has nothing to do
with actuality. None of us today can
know the real national interest of
America in South-East Asia; history will
still be arguing about it a thousand
years from now. The politician, there-
fore, must be concerned with less grand
concepts: whether it is just possible
to stay; whether it is just possible to
meet a commitment; whether it is just

possible that this risk may be more
justifiable than that. For risk is the
inner nature of all political decision.
If Churchill had consulted Britain’s
“real” national interest in 1940, he
would have made as fast and favorable
an armistice with Germany as possible.
But he did not, and it should be real-
ised that his defiance was justified, not
by Britain’s heroism or Britain’s
strength, for the one could have been
trampled on and the other was non-
existent, but by an imponderable: the
fact that Hitler proceeded to miscal-
culate, that he thought he could leave
Britain aside while he turned to con-
quer the East. No one could have
foreseen such a frantic miscalculation
by Hitler —yet, without it, Churchill’s
resistance would have been a lamentable
misconception of Britain’s real national
interests.
In these and in every other concept
which the intellectual uses in the dis-
cussion of current politics, he assumes
a knowledge which the politician knows
is not available and argues with a cer-
tainty which the politician is bound to
eschew. The charismatic leader—and
President Kennedy had many of the
qualities of one —will always present
political decision with something of this
certainty. I feel much safer with the
inconclusive, even messy, arguments of
the present administration.
Lastly, the intellectual in America, by
the prominence which he accepts in
political life, distracts attention from
the real business of politics. Politics is,
first and foremost, the eliciting, even
the manufacture, of support. With all
respect to the intellectuals at home,
and to the qualms of some governments
abroad, President Johnson is today act-
ing with a breadth of support and a
lack of effective opposition which strike
awe in any open-eyed observer. I do
not, personally, like it; I do not think
it healthy that a democracy should have
become so lopsided that no source of
...and back at the ranch.
political opposition is easily to be
found. This was the point made by a
..British colleague, Mr. Patrick O’ Dono-
van, when he wrote recently in the
“Washington Post” that Washington
had become a one-man town.
The fault is not President Johnson’s;
it is the duty, as it is the right, of any
political leader to seek the maximum
support for his policies that he can.
Where, then, does the fault lie?
It lies, first, in the stampede to
President Johnson in November, 1964.
America is today paying the political
price for voting as if the choice were
between right and wrong, between good
and evil. No one assisted in presenting
the choice in these terms more effec-
tively than the intellectuals. When
they should have been skulking in their
lairs, using the quiet but insistent voice
of the intellectual to warn that a stam-
pede to one leader or one party is al-
ways democracy’s dearest mistake, they
instead helped to whip up the stam-
pede. It was the intellectuals, as much
as anyone, who created the Colossus;
they, as much as anyone, who worked
for the annihilation of one of the great
parties of the State; they, as much as
anyone, who provided the reasons why
a democracy should elect a dictator.
Moreover, they still (in political
terms) argue with their hands tied.
President Johnson’s strength rests
entirely on support for his domestic
program. There is only one way of
damaging him, only one way of barter-
ing with him, and that is by obstructing
his domestic program. It is, quite
simply, impossible to allow him a “con-
sensus” at home, and deny it to him
abroad. Politics is, in this sense, one. It
is quite permissible to welcome the col-
lapse of the Southern bloc in the
Senate; but democracy will not be
healthy until another —more than one
self-interested bloc —emerges, ready and
able to bargain with the executive, ready
and able to engage the President on
every front, to achieve its own selfish
ends on onei
To put it quite simply, President
Johnson, by his domestic program, has
bribed the nation. The only way of
attacking him is to refuse the bribe.
Political needs require precise poli-
tical action. But this is what public
opinion cannot provide today, since it is
greedy for the bribes which President
Johnson offers; it is what no party can
provide, since the opposition party was
deliberately undermined last Novem-
ber by a campaign of frivolous irre-
sponsibility; and it is what Congress
cannot supply, since it dare not be seen
to refuse the bribes which the President
offers to their constituents. It is to this
distortion of the political process that
intellectuals should be paying deep
attention, the urgent need for finding,
inside politics, centres of disaffection,
which can then flatter, cajole, barter,
purchase, arm-twist, intimidate, and
trample at least as effectively as the
Chief Executive.

“FREEDOM IN
AUSTRALIA”
1. AGGRESSIVE
CONFORMISTS?
By DOUGLAS McCALLUM
Two comments on a con-
troversial new book exam-
ining the state of our civil
liberties .
A MONASH man who fell among
political scientists recently was
overheard arguing that Australia
was the most brutal and fascist coun-
try he had ever known. It turned out
that this hyperbole was based on
experience of two and only two coun-
tries, New Zealand and Australia.
When we recall instances of the brutal
behaviour of Australian police or their
victims we might feel inclined to agree
that Australia has not been untouched
by the increasing brutalisation of life
in this century, even if we are bound
to demur at a loose use of the boo-
word “fascist.” When we observe the
new barbarisms on the rampage to the
North, however, whether in Indonesia
or China, we might feel inclined to
complacency. With whatever limita-
tions, Personal Freedom, Freedom of
Expression, Freedom of Organisation,
and other freedoms do survive in Aus-
tralia.
But while we may have some grounds
for complacency, this new book, “Free-
dom in Australia,” by Miss Enid Camp-
bell, of Sydney, and Professor Harry
Whitmore, of the ANU, shows clearly
we have many, many grounds for dis-
satisfaction with the present state of the
law about civil liberties and individual
freedom. Complacency has been
reinforced by ignorance and confusion.
Discussions about freedom in Aus-
tralia could well be one long moan
about confusion. Some reasons for the
confusion are obvious. Freedom is
a glorious and beautiful word, but
it is also a weazel - word, born
in conflict, all things to all men, giving
rise to passion and cynicism. And so
far as it affects and is affected by the
law, freedom is immensely complicated.
In Australia today, cynicism about the
word freedom (especially among the
young) triumphs over hard and clear
thought about how specific freedoms
may be exercised. The value of the
Campbell and Whitmore book is that
it will be an important aid in curing
at least a little ignorance and con-
fusion, if not cynicism.
It gives rise to three preliminary re-
flections. First, it confirms again
what has long been a commonplace,
that Australians pride themselves on
being irreverent, aggressive ■ in-
dividualists, keen on a “fair go” for
all, but that in practice Australians are
much more like aggressive conformists
who deserve a reputation for intoler-
ance, restrictiveness, and submissiveness.
They, unheeding Mrs. Jones, put up
with a multitude of restrictions, are
remarkably incurious about administra-
tive discretion, and are unprotesting
about the bureaucratisation of daily
life. Rules and regulations and regi-
mentation are applied to almost every-
thing. A passage from Campbell and
Whitmore gives this sketch of an
ordinary Australian’s day: “He wakes
to the sound of a radio—which may
be censored. His first thought is of
the new house he wishes to build
when he gets a building approval.
Breakfast consists of bacon and eggs,
quality and price controlled by a
marketing board. The rest of the day is
repetition of the first part. He probably
goes to sleep while watching
Government-censored television, after a
surfeit of beer price-controlled and
taxed by the Government.”
Secondly, although the book gives
us a great deal of most important
information—information that only the
anarchist will scorn having—it also
reveals limitations to a purely lawyer’s
Professor of Political Science,
University of N.S.W.
approach. Law is not and ought not
to be the final standard in matters
of freedom. The authors protest
against complacency, the erosion of
freedom by legislation, regulation, and
by the courts, and they protest against
the lack of protest. They also make
many detailed and severe criticisms of
particular invasions of freedom. But
a number of remarks suggest a rather
hoity-toity attitude to laymen not so
committed to law as the final test of
freedom as our authors are.
Thirdly, there is in their work little
sociology of the law relating to free-
dom. Their book tends to concentrate
Enid Campbell
upon ministers, public servants, police-
men and judges, as possible invaders
and restricters of freedom. But enemies
of freedom are to be found in sections
of the Australian population which do
not command official positions or posi-
tions of formal power: interest groups,
including religious pressure groups,
morality-mongers, wowsers, “viewers
with alarm,” apostles of uplight. The
authors do draw attention to the way in
which the co-operation of booksellers
and publishers assists censorship, or the
way in which the commercial interests
of film distributors are not upset by
arbitrary cuts in films. But more
sociology of law would have been
welcome.
The Monash man’s view that Aus-
tralia is a fascist country is not con-
firmed by the longest and best chapter
in the book, that devoted to the no-
man’s land of “Police Powers.” The
powers of our police are not those of
either fascist or communist regimes,
nor are they as depressing as those of
some countries which, like the United
States, are more democratic than Aus-
tralia. Mr. St. John is more com-
petent than I am to discuss the law
of the matter, but the layman must
be grateful for the wealth of detail
and hard law here brought together.
Miss Campbell and Professor Whit-
more confirm the suspicion that deten-
tion for questioning, without any for-
mal arrest being made, is practised by
the police far more commonly than is
realised, so that the niceties of the law
are flagrantly disregarded. They hope
that, in the future, formulation of
correct standards of police interroga-
tion will get greater publicity than
has been the case. “At present, the
instructions and standing orders of
Police Commissioners on interroga-
tions are treated as private communi-
cations from the Commissioner to his
subordinates and ordinary citizens have
no right to know their contents . . .
It is nonsense to say that such regu-
lations are solely for the discipline of
the police. They deal with the relation
between the police and the public and
the public surely is entitled to know
what standards the police are expected
to maintain.”
There is, furthermore, the rarity of
civil actions against the police, which
arise out of unwarranted assaults on
the person, and unlawful seizure of
property. “For every such action, there
probably are at least ten other in-
stances in which citizens have just
cause for complaint against the police
but, for one reason or another, pre-
ferred not to take legal proceedings.”
Eleswhere the authors argue firmly
that the vagrancy concept is outmoded,

that it should be scrapped entirely and
replaced by some more intelligent
scheme. Again, they contend, “It is
difficult to understand how any com-
munity with a tradition of freedom
could tolerate the enactment of a law
which makes it an offence to merely
stand and wait —the offence of loitering
in a public place and failing to give a
satisfactory account of oneself.” We
also serve who merely stand and wait.
Charges of offensive behaviour, punish-
able summarily before magistrates, are
such that it is more likely than not
that the police assessment of what is
offensive will be accepted by the stipen-
diary magistrates, and the majority of
convictions are not reviewed by the
superior courts.
Campbell and Whitmore, neverthe-
less, challenge the glib and facile assump-
tion that any extension of police powers
takes us one step further toward a
“police state.” Some things the citizen
now has to complain about in the
exercise of police powers might be im-
proved if procedures were regularised.
Later, they discuss the discretion to
prosecute, and argue that when policies
about how the discretion has to be
exercised are formulated by the police
or the Government, the public has a
just claim to know about them. In
their opinion, prosecuting decisions
should be taken out of the hands of the
police entirely and delegated to Crown
Prosecutors.
Alternations of darkness and light are
revealed as the authors survey other
parts of the landscape of liberty in Aus-
tralia. We must still be vigilant in
scrutinising the discretionary power of
government to issue or refuse passports.
But Campbell and Whitmore argue
that a turning point came with the
influence upon Australian practice of
the American Supreme Court’s
declaration of the right to travel of
1958. In the 1950 s it was hardly true
that travel was regarded as a right in
Australia. By the 1960 s we could speak
of a right to travel. On the other hand,
they argue that there is little left of the
right to hold a meeting or procession.
Again, they are highly critical of the
frightening concentration of powers of
control (“near-dictatorial powers”) in
the Australian Broadcasting Control
Board and the Minister, and of the Film
Censorship Board.
Censorship of books is still more
extreme than anything to be found
in Britain or the United States, and
in an addendum the authors find signs
that the slight trend toward liberalisa-
tion in Australia (which lags way be-
hind that in Britain or America) is
nearing its end. There are excellent
discussions of obscenity, defamation,
contempt of court and of Parliament,
security of the State, and freedom of
speech, and the freedom of religion.
There are especially useful chapters
on problems of freedom and the law
in connection with the treatment of
the sick, freedom to work, and freedom
of property, and the Aborigines.
The torment of secrecy grows. “The
Attorney-General will give no infor-
mation about telephone tapping. The
recommendations of the Literature and
Film Censorship Boards will never be
made public. Security operations must
not be discussed, even in Parliament.
Instructions to policemen on the con-
duct of interrogations cannot be dis-
closed. No information may be given
on the cancellation or refusal of entry
permits. Departmental files are secret.”
This list is endless. A bizarre juxta-
position of the only two examples in
which the leave or direction of an
Attorney-General is necessary before
anyone can be prosecuted links the
banal egoism of nations with the atavis-
tic taboos of the family: consent of the
Federal Attorney-General for prosecu-
tion of an offence concerned with
official secrets under the Federal
Crimes Act, and consent of the N.S.W.
Attorney-General for prosecution for
incest.
Most of us are ignorant about the
laws relating to liberty. Not only
anarchists but a great many liberals
also take the easy way out and attitu-
dinise, rather than acquaint themselves
with the hard issues that judges,
lawyers, and legal scholars have to face
up to. This book, the most valuable
production of the infant Sydney Uni-
versity Press so far, takes away one
excuse for our ignorance about free-
dom and the law in Australia, and
should be compulsory reading for all
libertarians.
2. ERODED
LIBERTIES
By R. J. B. St. JOHN
Vice-President, Council for Civil
Liberties
THIS excellent work amply justifies
the existence of academic law-
yers of the modern variety, such
as Miss Campbell and Professor Whit-
more. In “Freedom in Australia,” not
only is the law lucidly and concisely ex-
plained, but its application, its misuse
for purposes for which it was not
intended, and the arguments for and
against its continuance or rejection
are discussed. In their preface the
authors disclaim championship oL civil
liberties but emphasise that hard-won
liberties have been eroded by legisla-
tion and judicial decisions. Their dis-
claimer should be read with such
statements as: “Despite the appear-
ance of legal framework, the Common-
wealth system of censorship is merely
a facade to cloak the reality of censor-
ship by the Minister and his depart-
mental officials.” Their dissociation
from “the more extravagant claims
for individual liberty” is probably re-
flected in the statement: “We must
beware that they do not exacerbate re-
lations between Aborigines and their
white neighbors to a point where pro-
gress toward improvement of the
Aborigines’ conditions is brought to a
standstill.” The overall impression that
will be created on reading this book
is a deep concern at the lack of indi-
vidual freedom suffered by the Aus-
tralian community rather than pride
in the preservation of it.
Divided into four parts personal
freedom; freedom of expression;
economic freedom; the individual and
his government —the law is compart-
mented under various headings. The
last part includes the status of’
Aborigines and is extremely short,
covering only five pages. The legal
position of Aborigines has not yet been
the subject of a legal publication and it
is disappointing that the authors found
it too voluminous to include.
The first part, personal freedom,
deals with the criminal law, police
power, detention in institutions for the

The student demonstration in Sydney in May, 1964, which police broke up
too vigorously.
mentally ill, and freedom of move-
ment. The discussion of use and abuse
of the power of arrest by policemen is
thorough and well balanced and it em-
phasises the difficulties confronting the
police as well as the difficulties faced
by the suspect. The lay reader will
learn with some surprise that only in
Queensland has a suspect the right to
the presence of an independent person
at a police interrogation.
In discussing the principle of the
individual responsibility of the police-
man for his unlawful acts, the authors
state that the victim may be hesitant
to sue the policeman because the
policeman may lack the means to satisfy
the verdict. This statement indicates
some lack of knowledge, forgiven in
academic lawyers, of the New South
Wales Governmental practice in rela-
tion to claims against the police.
On 23rd September, 1965, Mr. R. C.
Packer, MLC, asked a question designed
to elucidate why and how a verdict of
£BOO awarded against a policeman
came to be paid by the Govern-
ment. The written reply explained the
procedure adopted for determining
whether or not the Crown will act for
a Crown employee against whom legal
proceedings had been instituted arising
out of an incident occuring in the course
of the employee’s duties. Shortly, the
answer was “that a thorough depart-
mental investigation” is undertaken
and, if it is considered by the Depart-
ment of the employee that the request
for legal representation and indemnity
should be agreed to, the circumstances
are submitted for the consideration of
the Department of the Attorney-
General and Justice, where the final
decision is made as to whether the
case is one in which the Crown should
act “with the consequential indemni-
fication of the employee against any
verdict and costs.”
In actions for malicious prosecution,
false arrest, and assault against a
policeman, punitive damages may be
awarded against the defendant police-
man, and in most cases such damages
are the major part of the verdict. Where
the right to indemnification is deter-
mined before the action is brought,
the plaintiff has the opportunity of re-
covering only against the community
of which he is a member, with the
disquieting thought that the punitive
damages, designed to act as a deter-
rent, have no punishing effect. The
indemnification of the policeman as
to verdict and costs is to be contrasted
with the position of the innocent per-
son charged with a crime where, even
though he be acquitted, he has prac-
tically no chance of his costs being
awarded against the police, however
thin the evidence is against him or
however malicious is the prosecution.
With Federal elections imminent,
aliens, whether they be migrants or
not, would do well to contemplate the
tenuous hold they have on their right
to stay in this country. The authors
emphasise the lack of judicial control
over ministerial decisions in this field.
In dealing with freedom of expres-
sion, comprising JPart II of the book,
the various forms of censorship and
restrictions on freedom of speech are
dealt with, including defamation and
contempt of Court and Parliament.
In the chapter on obscenity the authors
have omitted to mention the provisions
relating to the licensing of distributors
under the New South Wales Obscene
Publications Act and in particular Sec-
tion 24, which empowers the Court
upon the conviction to cancel or sus-
pend registration of the defendant’s
licence. This section was probably de-
signed to, and does, have a tendency
to turn distributors into censors.
The authors also tend to under'
rate the importance of public meetings
and processions in this age of mass
media. However, in some cases it seems
that the public meeting or demonstra-
tion of today achieves a far wider audU
ence and greater impact because of its
news value and consequential trans-
mission over radio and television
stations. This is so particularly where
there is police intervention. Such a
case, namely, the Sydney University
student demonstration outside the
United States Consulate in May, 1964,
is mentioned. This demonstration and
its consequences are a good example of
how the various freedoms of expression
complement one another. At the demon-
stration a television cameraman was
arrested and charged with offensive
behaviour, but because his fellow-
cameramen from other stations were
able to film the whole sequence of his
arrest the magistrate refused to accept
the police evidence and dismissed the
charge at the end of the prosecution
case. All films were made available to
the university students similarly
charged with offensive behaviour, and
the use of film and other still photo-
graphs was instrumental in showing
in a number of cases that the police
witnesses had forgotten the vigor with
which they had broken up the demon-
stration and their evidence was not
accepted. The authors suggest that the
subsequent decline in police enthusiasm
for breaking up demonstrations was
attributable to the students being ade-
quately defended with proper legal
representation.
ECONOMIC freedom, which is
divided into freedom to work and
freedom of property, comprises Part
111. Both these subjects are adequately
condensed. In dealing with town plan-
ning the authors emphasise the neces-
sity for greater safeguards against
officiousness and corruption in the
Local Government and other statutory
bodies administering planning schemes.
The conclusions reached by the
authors are that legislative reforms
are necessary in many areas. Preserva-
tion of individual freedom deserves
immediate action “in some critical
contexts.” These critical contexts in-
clude elimination of such a vague
offence as loitering, vagrancy, and
offensive behaviour, repeal of censor-
ship law and a fresh start made on a
more sensible basis and a clearer de-
finition of police power. One special
criticism is made of Australian Govern-
ments in contrast to those of England,
the United States, and many other
countries. This is that no official in-
quiries have been set up to examine the
problems of administrative power,
police procedures, censorship, security
measures, and kindred subjects. In a
limited way the Askin Government in
N.S.W. has done something by the estab-
lishment of a Law Reform Commission.
There has been no suggestion to date
that it will hear evidence publicly in the
form of an open inquiry.

Sinai and Suez
Ten Years After the Other War
By SAM LIPSKI
MID-OCTOBER, 1956; the heavily
accented Scots Hebrew did not
quite make the meaning clear,
so he turned to me and explained: “He
was only a wee Arab so I couldn’t
shoot him. I fired at the roof above
him to scare him off. But the bastard
wasn’t frightened and got me in the
legs with his machine gun.” It was a
good story, anyhow, and the red-
bearded Glaswegian sitting up in bed,
pillow-propped and fruit-surrounded,
made the most of it as he told admiring
fellow kibbutz members how his para-
troop unit had attacked a Jordanian
police fort a few nights earlier. Israel
had launched yet another night reprisal
raid, this time against the Kalkiliah
police fort, and losses had been the
heaviest for the year —18 killed and
more than 50 wounded. Jordanian
casualties were estimated at more than
100 killed. The Glaswegian paratrooper
was among the Israeli wounded, and a
fortnight later, when Israel mobilised
and invaded the Sinai Peninsula, he
cursed the “wee Arab” loud and long.
The Paratroop brigade was Israel’s elite
force and spearheaded the Sinai in-
vasion with a daring drop 125 miles
behind the Egyptian lines. For the luck-
less Scotsman, who wanted to be with
his unit, the last days of October, 1956,
were hard ones.
I was reminded of him recently when
reading General Moshe Dayan’s “Diary
of the Sinai Campaign.” Kalkiliah was
the last of the night reprisal raids in
1956, and Dayan describes how the
attack on the police fort nearly ended
in disaster for the Israelis, with the
threatened loss_ of four times their
eventual casualties. The near-disaster
made it clear that this form of response
to Arab terrorism could not continue.
By mid-October 1956, therefore, and
after Kalkiliah, Israel found itself, in
Dayan’s apt phrase, in a state of “no-
peace and no-war.” This was after a
year during which every day brought
news of another terrorist attack on a
bus, a school, an irrigation pump; far-
mers murdered in the fields, children
shot in kindergartens and, in one grisly
incident, blown up while at prayer.
The mood that went with that year
is a hard one to be specific about now,
ten years later. I recall that, in one of
the first letters I wrote after arriving
in Israel in February, I said that war
with the Arabs seemed inevitable but
that I had no doubt Israel would emerge
victorious. This, I suspect, was largely
a mixture of whistling in the dark and
a touch of the country’s pervasive self-
confidence.
Preparations for war were inescap-
able., Shelters were being built in main
streets, air-raid drills for schools were
held regularly, and anti-aircraft bat-
teries could be seen at certain points
along the Tel Aviv beachfront. Every-
where they went soldiers carried their
weapons with them, and the sight of an
18-year-old Israeli girl toting a sub-
machine gun was formidable indeed. It
made social contacts difficult.
I had come to Israel for a year’s
study at the Institute for Youth Lead-
ers from Abroad, a scholarship scheme
financed by the Israeli Government for
Zionist youth movement leaders. The
first six months of the training course
were spent based in Jerusalem, the rest
of the time on a kibbutz, called Ein
Tsurim in Southern Israel near the
coastal city of Ashkelon.
The first real indication that some-
thing more than just another Kal-
killiah was brewing was the mobilisa-
tion order which appeared on the
kibbutz notice board on the Friday
afternoon of October 26. Something
like two dozen of the settlement’s 80
eligible men were ordered to join their
reserve units. Everyone assumed that
an invasion of Jordan was imminent,
which, as Dayan explains, was precisely
what Israel wanted everybody to
assume including both the Jordan-
ians and the Egyptians.
evening was the Sabbath and,
being a religious kibbutz, it passed,
as did the next day, in quietness. But
hardly in relaxation. Since an orthodox
Jew may not switch on any electric
power on the Sabbath, none of them
had switched on a radio, and none
knew if the country was at war. By
lunch-time Saturday, however, every-
body did know. The news had come
from the one non-believer on the kib-
butz. A former orthodox Jew like his
fellow-members, he had abandoned all
religious observance after he and some
of the founders of the kibbutz had been
captured by the Arab Legion in 1948
during Israel’s War of Independence.
The first Ein Tsurim settlement had
been in the Judean Hills not far from
Bethlehem, and had fallen with three
others. The loss of life had been heavy
after savage fighting. In hushed whis-
pers, newer kibbutz members spoke of
the non-believer with some awe. “He
says that after the war there cannot
be a God.” He never attended the
synagogue, and that Sabbath morning
was no exception. But he had a radio
in his hut, and nothing prevents an
orthodox Jew from talking to a non-
believer on the Sabbath.
On Monday night the early evening
news made no mention of any raids or
troop movements. It had been three
days since the mobilization and we
wondered if the attack on Jordan had
been called off. But in the nine o’clock
news broadcast came the announce-
ment Sinai had been invaded.
The news broadcasts the next day
Dayan—no-peace, no-war.
continued to tell of Israeli progress
through the Sinai Peninsula and kibbutz
members began to joke about taking
holidays in Cairo. By the second night
everyone was confident that, whatever
the outcome of the political struggle
that was looming, the military campaign
would be a victory.
By this time, of course, Israel was
at war in defiance of the United
Nations. As Dayan implies, and as
others have made clear, there had been
'collusion between Britain, France, and
Israel before the Sinai Campaign was
launched. Although Israel’s political
objectives were not the same as those
of France and Britain, her attack ,on
Egypt offered the pretext for Anglo-
French intervention against Egypt’s
nationalisation of the Suez Canal. At
the same time the Israeli attack would
not have gone ahead in the way it did
had it not been for the Anglo-French
plans and the opportunities this gave
the Israeli forces to take some of the
fantastic risks they did in the cam-
paign. (Compared with losses an esti-
mated ten times their own number,
Israeli losses of about 170 dead and 800
wounded were small.)
All this is now the subject of renewed
debate and discussion, especially in
Britain, where a spate of revelations
and reconstructions has led to a call
for a Royal Commission into the
“Suez Conspiracy.” While the rumors
about collusion began very quickly, in
fact, almost immediately after the
French and the British invaded the
Suez Canal area, they were, as I recall,
not taken very seriously at the time
by the Israelis. They had their own
war to worry about and their war was
Sinai, not Suez. The Israelis were
proud of their army’s dash and courage
and they felt that whatever the
motives of Britain and France, their
own were completely justified.
For Israelis the war began on October
29 and ended on November 5 when one
of the Sinai campaign’s main objectives,
the capture of Sharm E-Sheikh was
achieved. With that, Israel had gained
vital access to the Red Sea —previously
denied them by the Egyptian blockade.
For Prime Minister Ben Gurion and
his Government and Israel’s diplomats
the big battle was still to come. But
for the Israeli citizen “the war” was
over. Suez was another war.

CAN MOVE
30.000 TONS OF
COAL A DAY!
A5BO/7
At Morwell Victoria, the longest single-flight,
high-speed conveyor system in Australia is
carrying brown coal from the open cut to Hazel-
wood Power Station, miles away. Plans for the
conveyor system were adopted by the State
Electricity Commission Victoria after a thorough
investigation of all means of transporting coal
over such a distance.
Built to exacting specifications by Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co. (Australia) Ltd., the two
steel cable conveyors operate at a speed of 1050
feet a minute carrying 2000 tons of coal an hour.
The belts are 7244 feet and 8560 feet long, 48
inches wide, approximately f inch thick and con-
sist entirely of rubber and 500 miles of steel
cables. Minimum breaking strength is 423,000
pounds. The structure of the belt allows the cable
maximum lateral movement. There is no tearing
under impact!
The seven miles of Goodyear belting used on
the two mainlines for Hazelwood is another
example of the numerous advantages of steel
cable belting. It has an extremely high tensile
strength. Its design makes it trough perfectly and
have the best impact resistance of any belt con-
struction. Stretching and elongation is negligible
so short take up lengths are possible.
If you have a project where you need conveyor
belting remember Goodyear conveyor belting. It's
the best. Contact the Goodyear technical man at
the Goodyear branch inyour state.
GOOD-YEAR


ONE MORE
WEEK
The Art-Haters of N.Z.
THE POLITICIANS of New Zealand
have gone one step further than their
art-hating colleagues in most other
countries. They have forbidden New
Zealanders to buy foreign paintings—
which in practice mainly means Aus-
tralian paintings. The story started in
1958 when the Labor Government
brought in import controls which made
no allowance, even for public galleries,
to buy overseas art works. After a
period of controversy the Government
finally allowed 15 public galleries and
museums to operate with £15,000 be-
tween them. Today the National Gov-
ernment allows 33 galleries and
museums to operate with £12,150! A
private collector is absolutely forbidden
to spend N.Z. money on overseas art
works.
So this month while the city of
Auckland Art Gallery is exhibiting Aus-
tralian paintings by Blackman, Boyd,
French, Hessing, Nolan, Molvig, White-
ley, Dickerson, Davies, etc., no New
Zealander can buy any of them. Writ-
ing in the catalogue in Auckland, the
gallery director, G. I, Docking (who
until last year was director of the New-
castle Gallery, N.S.W.), says that the
whole scandal may become a matter of
the United Nations! He writes:
“The national and international func-
tions of a painter are recognised by the
UN in Article IV of the UNESCO
1950 Free-Flow Agreement, which is
specifically designed to make it easier
to import cultural material in the
interests of intellectual progress, inter-
national understanding, and peace.
“We are told that N.Z. is a party to
this Agreement: that in ‘very general
terms N.Z. honors its undertakings by
completely exempting a wide range of
educational, scientific, and cultural im-
ports from Customs Duty,’ but that,
‘unfortunately, paintings’ are excluded
from N.Z.’s part of the Agreement.”
The obsolescent milliner
THE WIG BUSINESS and the hat
business are eternal enemies, since you
can’t wear a hat on a wig. But wigs
are winning—Australians now import
$400,000 worth of wigs and hairpieces
annually—and ladies’ hats look like
becoming obsolescent. The only thing
that the hat business can do is to
recognise that if you can’t win, join.
So one large Melbourne millinery
manufacturer, Ultra Hats Pty. Ltd., is
joining with an American company,
Tovar Tresses Inc., to form Tovar
Tresses (Aust.) Ltd. and manufacture
Dynel Modacrylic Tresses and Chig-
nons. Within the next two years the
company plans to sell three million
Dynel Tresses at the value of about $6
million. This virtually pre-supposes that
the women of today will have a hair-
wig or hairpiece tomorrow —and by
1971 there will be four million Aus-
tralian women over nineteen years of
ago.
The majority of wigs on the Aus-
tralian market now are imported from
Hong Kong and, to a lesser degree,
Japan. They are either handmade
($80), machine-made ($40), or semi-
mechanised ($70). Many are made from
natural hair, but synthetics such as
nylon and acrylics are making inroads.
Hairpieces and plaits are, of course,
much cheaper, and it is in this section
of the market that Tovar Tresses
(Aust.) Ltd. will make their attack.
Salesgirls are already being trained in
one Melbourne store to blend and sell
tresses and wigs.
Dada
TO LAUNCH a new book at four-
o’clock of a Brisbane Sunday afternoon
is a new dimension of Dadaism. The
book was “Under Twenty-five,” a col-
lection of poems, stories, drawings, and
photographs, all by people who have
not yet passed the climacteric of their
25th year. Two thousand young people
submitted manuscripts and 50 or so got
into the book.
The slipway for the launching was
a cellar underneath the Obselite coffee
lounge. Folk etymology is fixed on
elite as the end of the word, but
the beginning is obsolete, obscure (25-
watt bulbs heavily shaded), obscene,
or obstetric according to your inclina-
tions.
Brian Clouston, manager of Jaca-
randa Press, whose junior staff, all
under 25, edited and produced the
book, was tut-tutting because the
younger set was making a hash of tap-
ping the keg. The cellar was coffin-
shaped and unventilated. A sad fishing-
net prolapsed from the ceiling on to
the head of a girl who kept saying
she did not want to leave Brisbane and
a man with an eye-patch who said he
had damaged his eye from the juice of
a naked lady (which turned out to be
a poisonous local tree). When the
band came an illustrator did a surpris-
ing went-went dance and a poet was
moved by the muses to recite a new
piece. Several authors disappeared
up the chimney leaving only their feet
visible.
Book launchings will never be the
same again and neither will the Bris-
bane Sunday.
Protest
IT WAS Balmain Town Hall’s biggest
public meeting since the Depression
(bigger even than A. A. Calwell’s Viet-
nam protest meeting earlier in the
year). The contestants: The residents
of Sydney’s waterfront suburb of Bal-
main, and the N.S.W. Maritime Ser-
vices Board. The subject: containerisa-
tion. The audience: 500 residents.
The MSB has selected Balmain as
the container base for ships. The people
of Balmain, realising that this is a
noisy industry which works round the
clock and employs king-size transports
that will ply through their narrow
streets, are fearful that Balmain will
be quickly “destroyed.” The Balmain
Association decided to protest.
Most notable absentee was W. H,
Brotherson, MSB President. Other non-
starters were the Department of Main
Roads (“problem did not con-
cern them”), State Planning Authority
(“will send observers”) and local State
member J. McMahon (Budget night).
The five who did speak were Aid. N.
Origlass, of Leichhardt Council, town
planner John Toon, Sydney Chamber
of Commerce President, F. C. Hewitt,
WWF Secretary, C. H. Fitzgibbon,
and Association representative R.
Irving.
The MSB has dug its toes in but the
meeting called for an open inquiry
into the container industry and for the
immediate stoppage of all work mean-
while.

Some Kind of Inspiration
SMALL, fine-boned, and brown, Les-
lie Uggams, now at Chequers,
Sydney, could be publicised as
Spanish, Mexican, or from the Mediter-
ranean and no one would dispute it —
but she calls herself a Negro, and she
says it very firmly.
“I was born in New York, and so
was my sister, but my parents come
from the South. We know what the
Civil Rights thing is all about. I
suppose it didn’t really touch me all
that much. But I had friends in the
ghettos. Some of them are still there,
and there is really no way they can get
out of it. I have memories of those
growing-up years. Oh, not riots and the
terrible things of today. But every
American Negro has some bitter
memories.”
They don’t extend to show business.
A performer at six on the Milton Berle
Show, Leslie enjoyed her singing, danc-
ing childhood. It was Milton Berle’s
mother who planted the seeds of am-
bition in Leslie, and particularly in her
mother, once a dancer at the Cotton
Club, who accompanied Leslie every-
where. It was a long, difficult trek
for them both. Mitch Miller opened
the door finally, projecting Leslie as
a sort of dark, wholesome imp against
his shoulder-to-shoulder background of
pleasant, middle-aged male singers.
Leslie sang and sang along with Mitch
for four years. Then when the show
ended she emerged as a valuable
property. But the small pert graduate
of Juilliard School of Music is not
the vapid songbird she might seem.
“J BELIEVE what is happening in
America must happen. It must be
allowed to happen so that it will even-
tually end. The Negro cannot be denied
his rights as a human being. I feel
that the worst thing is the deprivation
of a man’s masculinity. So often a
Negro family is supported by the woman
of the house. It’s probably the reason
for so many children in Negro families.
They are a way to show that he is still
there. Still a man.
“I feel that I am some kind of in-
spiration. Girls of my age, 23, can
look at me and think: ‘She made it.
She came out of our world and she
had to get there herself.’ Because I
did, really.”
Getting there for Leslie includes the
success of her almost-a-year marriage
to Australian Graham Kelvin Pratt, of
Denistone, N.S.W. She is prepared to
settle in Australia in ten years’ time. In
the meantime, her husband is with the
New York Stock Exchange and enjoy-
ing New York. He pursues his club-
appearing wife by aeroplane each week-
end, has himself become rather mili-
tantly aware of the Civil Rights situa-
tion. “Many of our friends are Negroes,
of course, and Graham, when he first
arrived, would hear us talking. Later
he’d say: ‘But this sort of thing can’t be
true.’ Then, of course, he came to
realise how difficult it all is.”
The endless pursuit of the lovely Les-
lie from Las Vegas to Los Angeles and
back to New York will end for Graham
at least for a while when they return
to the United States. She is scheduled
to start work on the musical “Halle-
lujah Baby’ on Broadway.
“I play a 25-year-old Negro girl
through four generations. In the last
act, the modern one, I am trying to
break into show business, while my
mother keeps telling me: ‘Be a maid,
Forget show business. Be a maid’.” A
sentiment Leslie’s own mother obviously
never held.
The Tetters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
A letter from Dr. Pearson informs me that you have been awoken at last
from the enforced sedation and are sitting up and writing to “The Times.”
His opinion seems to be that the Tory Party Conference may buck you up
a little as the only possible split in the Party will be between Lord Salisbury
and everyone else over Rhodesia. Much as I value his opinion, knowing how
you stand on Rhodesia or, more accurately, how you would like to jump up
and down on our colored brothers, I foresee the spilling of blood and further,
perhaps, deeper sedation.
The news here is still of Looney Bins Johnson’s visit. My word, they have
prepared an exciting schedule for the Great Man. Dignitaries are being shipped
in from all over the place so that the President can demonstrate his extra-
ordinary hand-shaking methods. He’s being treated to a barbecue, a trip
round the harbor, a visit to a massage parlor, a tour of Canberra, and all for
only $27.50. If this doesn’t boost the Tourist Industry, nothing will. The
only blot, as I see it, is that after the hectic to-ing and fro-ing, his one evening
off is a Friday night in a hotel in Brisbane. Sitting alone in a hotel room
with Lady Bird, watching television, and trying to get room-service seems no
life for the leader of the Western World. Still, it can’t have been much fun
for Hitler sitting in the bunker listening to the radio with Eva Braun. How
glad I am that we Gooseboots have never felt inclined to grasp the reins of
office.
One rumor that is rife is that Sir Robert is not actually in Virginia taking
on the onerous duties of Student in Residence at Charlottesville, but is being
held as a hostage until the safe return of Looney Bins to the Americas.
Yours ever,
Trevor.

“Brer Robert” in Virginia
Politics and Gridiron
By GEORGE McGANN
THE rolling hillsides of Albemarle
County (once Goochland) are
aflame these days with a kaleido-
scope of brilliant yellows, fading greens
and burnished browns, as the incredible
variety of native trees and foliage
passes through the autumnal mutation
of the “changing of the leaves.”
Throughout this lovely countryside the
people are talking politics in the final
weeks before the November 8 elections,
as the motorcades of rival candidates
roar through the streets of the towns,
loud-speakers blaring, extolling their
own virtues. And on the well-kept
grounds (never the “campus”) of the
University of Virginia, students and
faculty alike talk of little else but their
gridiron football team’s chances of re-
bounding from last Saturday’s humili-
ating trouncing by Tulane University.
And here in “Brer Rabbit” country is
Sir Robert Menzies, university scholar
in residence, hugely enjoying all mani-
festations of these current phenomena
of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Sir Robert and Dame Pattie arrived
in Charlottesville shortly before Com-
monwealth Day an annual gathering
of Democratic politicians (Republicans
don’t count for much in this part of the
South) which took on heightened signi-
ficance in this election year. A feature
of the festivities is always an afternoon
of football in Scott Stadium, and the
Menzies’ attended the match against
Tulane as guests of the Governor of
Virginia, Mills Godwin, and the Presi-
dent of the University, Edgar Shannon,
Jun. Upon the arrival of Sir Robert,
his knowledge of the complexities of
Virginia politics was as limited as his
grasp of gridiron football, which he had
never witnessed. But that brilliant legal
mind remains unimpaired at seventy-
one, and by half-time of Saturday after-
noon’s game Sir Robert was thoroughly
conversant with the significance of first
down and fully appreciative of the need
of a quarterback who can forward pass;
he was also on easy conversational terms
with a good many of the 375 politicians
and their wives attending the game.
As a sharp-eyed reporter for the
Richmond “Times-Dispatch” noted,
“Sir Robert, who will shortly begin a
series of lectures here on the Aus-
tralian Constitution and such matters,
seemed to be quite at home meeting
Virginia politicians and talking
politics and football interchangeably.”
The primary purpose of Sir Robert’s
visit to the beautiful university
whose conception and design were the
greatest pride of founder Thomas
Jefferson —is to deliver a series of seven
public lectures on the general topic of
Federal-State relations in Australia,
under the joint auspices of the prestigi-
Sir Robert and the Founder.
ous Graduate Law School and the
Woodrow Wilson Department of
Government and Foreign Affairs. When
Sir Robert voices support for friend
Lyndon Johnson’s policies in Vietnam,
the impact on American public opinion
could be impressive. Americans are
not used to hearing foreign statesmen
speak up in support of this cause.
Arrangements are also under way for
Sir Robert to appear on television, a
medium made to order for a man
with his photogenic good looks and
unmatched oratorical gifts. The fact
that a national election, in which Viet-
nam is an issue, is imminent lends
further interest to Sir Robert’s speak-
ing plans.
In addition to his University of Vir-
ginia commitments, Sir Robert is sift-
ing through numerous requests from
other American universities to accept
speaking engagements, honorary de-
grees, and the like. At the moment he
has decided to speak at Drury in
Springfield, Missouri, at Yale, and at
Pennsylvania State University. These
forums will afford Sir Robert the de-
sired opportunity to air his views on
current world affairs—and particularly
on Vietnam.
J SPENT a half-hour with Sir Robert
in the private office assigned to him
in the Law Building at the University,,
and later chatted with him and Dame
Pattie in the antique-filled lounge-room
of “Morea,” the 132-year-old red-brick
house they are occupying on tree-lined
Sprig Lane, in the quiet residential
area of the University grounds. I can
report both in the finest of health and
spirits, intrigued by their surroundings,
and delighted with their reception by
the hospitable Virginians. This was the
afternoon of Sir Robert’s opening lec-
ture in Gilmer Hall and he was look-
ing forward to it, not unlike an actor
on opening night. He was in fine con-
versational form, amusing anecdotes


the four things
to look for in
storage
racking
m
A
STRENGTH. When you're buying racking, plan for future require-
ments. You’ll need good, strong racking that can carry anything,
whose stability increases with load.
FLEXIBILITY. Good racking has to be adaptable and preferably
self-locking. It is also important that it can be readily re-arranged
by your own staff to accommodate any sized products. There
should be no nuts or bolts to meddle with—they are time wasters.
PRICE. Truly efficient design produces the least expensive rack-
ing. Make sure that the price you pay will buy racking that will
do your job today . . . and tomorrow!
ADVICE. The more your rack supplier knows about your storage
problem the more chance he has of solving it. Acrow have the
best space consultants in the business. Phone them now,
without obligation.

making his points, and ranging over a
variety of topics, but always getting
back to politics both Australian and
American.
Discussing Johnson’s forthcoming,
visit to Australia, Sir Robert remarked:
“I know what Arthur Calwell will say
that the visit was planned to help
Holt in the November election. It’s
a lot of nonsense, of course, but it’s
bound to happen. Australians will give
Johnson a warm welcome. You can
be sure of that. The solid majority
support him on Vietnam. The so-called
students will make a loud noise, march-
ing and protesting. But Johnson should
be used to that. I know I was.
“I’m on good terms with Johnson,”
Sir Robert added. “I plan to visit him
in the White House, but I am not
sure about the timing, in view of his
Pacific tour. I may have to wait until
his return. I am also looking forward
to seeing Dean Rusk in Washington,
and Ave Harriman if he is in town.”
As for American politics, Sir Robert is
fascinated by the plight of the Repub-
lican Party, which seems destined to
remain in opposition for many years
on the national level. “They have no
leadership, and nothing really solid
to offer the people,” he remarked.
“When I was out of office I decided
that the only way to get back in was
with a positive program. It’s no good
just sitting back criticising the govern-
ment.”
ROBERT agreed that the Demo-
crats seemed to have a monopoly on
bright young presidential prospects,
notably Senator Robert Kennedy. That
reminded him of a conversation he
had with Arthur Krock, former Wash-
ington columnist of the New York
“Times,” on a visit to Washington dur-
ing the 1962 elections. “I commented to
Krock that the election of younger
brother Ted Kennedy as Senator from
Massachusetts indicated the rise of a
dynasty, but Krock disagreed. “It just
shows how democratic we are in this
country,” Krock said. “Anyone can
vote for the Kennedy of his choice.”
The lecture that evening turned out
to be a personal triumph for Sir Robert.
A full house included townspeople as
well as academic types, in spite of the
advertised theme, “The growth of
commonwealth power in the Australian
Federation,” a topic which ordinarily
would have attracted only law students.
The mellifluous Menzies voice was at
its finest, the oratorical skill at a peak,
and the weighty subject enlivened by
flashes of wit and sarcasm. At the
finish the former Prime Minister got an
enthusiastic standing ovation.
The man primarily responsible for
bringing Sir Robert to Charlottesville
is William Battle, former U.S. Ambas-
sador to Canberra. Battle is a graduate
of the University Law School and a
member of an old Charlottesville family
long active in politics. His father, John
Battle, is a former Governor of Vir-
ginia, and he himself was active in
John F. Kennedy’s successful primary
campaign to gain ;the Democratic
nomination for the Presidency in 1960.
At a reception following the lecture,
Battle expressed the prevailing senti-
ment of university people, both faculty
and students, over Sir Robert’s presence
in their midst. “We are proud that a
man of such stature should accept the
invitation of this University,” Battle re-
marked. “I can’t think of another
instance of the chief executive of a
major nation becoming associated with
a university in another country and
giving it the benefit of his wisdom and
experience.”
Battle, who is a firm supporter of the
Administration’s course, is eager to see
that Sir Robert’s views are given the
widest possible exposure in this
country. “At a time when the Ameri-
can public is so confused over Vietnam,
it will be of the greatest value to have
Sir Robert explain Australia’s reasons
for actively assisting the United States
there.”


AROUND MELBOURNE
Where is the Eye of Monique?
UNTIL 1962 the Commonwealth
Bureau of Meterology refused
to give names to cyclones.
Cyclones were too elusive and, any-
way, the idea was rather too Ameri-
can>
I remember this causing awful
frustration around the sub-editor’s
table in Brisbane. We pleaded with
the local deputy director of the
Weather Bureau, but he maintained
a strong high-pressure indifference.
So there was only one thing to do,
we named the cyclones ourselves. It
gave a certain punch to a cyclone if
we could say BERTHA BELTS
BOWEN or CHLOE CLOBBERS
CAIRNS. And it was all very charm-
ing. Many a sub-editor’s wife became
a cyclone that year.
Now official policy has changed. It
helps the department to be on first
name terms with cyclones. It gives
them a label and enables them to be
identified and remembered for years
"SMITH...!"
afterwards. Even more important, if
you are about to be flattened in 20
minutes it helps radio communica-
tions if you can crisply describe sweet
Daphne’s movements and dimen-
sions.
It is interesting that Melbourne,
noted for its temperate climate and
out of reach of fierce cyclones, has
the supreme command for the
cyclone warning system. For the
benefit of cyclones Australia is divid-
ed into three areas, the eastern based
on Brisbane, the northern based on
Darwin, and the western based on
Perth.
This week, on your behalf, I sought
out Des Gaffney, the man in charge
of naming all cyclones, and he pre-
pares lists of names three years in
advance. Mr. Gaffney has a devil of
a time. Every three years he has to
find 100 female names. Now that
may sound easy enough, but they
have to be sharp, punchy female
names that sound good over a radio
network. Furthermore they have to
go into the record books. He can’t
repeat a female name in 10 years.*
Clara, Bessy, or Bertha are fine,
but Ermintrude or Shirlene are lousy
names for cyclones. Actually, last
year was a very light cyclone year.
Normally five can be expected in the
Eastern and Western areas. Queens-
land received just one, Connie.
The Northern Territory and West-
ern Australia had Amanda, Betty,
Lisa, and Shirley.
Now the 1966-67 cyclone season is
almost upon us and it goes through
until April, with March as the best
cyclone month. By the law of aver-
ages the time
is ripe to col-
lect a few
strong cyclones.
Mr. Gaffney
has ready An-
gela, Beryl,
Clara, Cynthia,
Dinah, Delilah,
Dorothy, and
Dulcie, just to
mention a few.
He did
rather well
with Delilah. It
sounds like a
mar v e 1 1 o u s
name for a
cyclone. How-
ever, he has
been very fair
about the
whole thing.
All his family
are cyclones.
His wife, Thelma, was listed for a
cyclone in Western Australia last
month, but being a “T” she just
missed out. His 12-year-old
daughter, Jill, is due to be a Queens-
land cyclone this year and his 13-
year-old daughter, Betsy, is a moral
to be a cyclone during the 1967-68
season.
The Western area uses the most
names because this is the largest. It
goes right across to the 70th longi-
tude half way to Africa, and for
warnings here the Bureau is depend-
ing more on French satellites. Here
our cyclones tend to blend with
French cyclones named in Mauritius,
and they name them very beauti-
fully. This year they will have
Angela, Colette, Gilberte, Monique,
Odette, Therese, Zoe, and Irma (we
trust La Douce).
Queensland, of course, always suf-
fers the most damage because of the
high population sugar towns, but the
worst cyclone area in Australia is
that stretch of Western Australian
cost that moves north-east from
Exmouth Gulf. This takes a terrible
thrashing, and the worst cyclone
town is Onslow. In the years gone by
there has even been talk of having
the town moved. Des Gaffney says
once they were hit by two cyclones
in 11 days.
The Bureau uses radar to check on
cyclones, and in Queensland there are
six of these alone. But they are down-
right difficult to tie down and this
is one reason why they are blessed
with female names. They are unpre-
dictable, utterly quixotic.
And these cyclones can be mighty
awe-inspiring. The core or the eye of
the cyclone can be two to 20 miles
across, with only light winds, usually
no rain, perhaps even sunny skies.
For the next 50 miles out you get a
fully developed cyclonp with winds
perhaps over 100 miles an hour,
dense spiralling black clouds, and
deluging rain.
Such is the female. There’s much
discussion about who first gave them
names. The American story is that
the novelist R. Stewart in his book
“Storm” published in 1941 had a
story about a young met. man who
named the low-pressure areas on his
map after girls. The most ferocious
of all was a low-pressure area called
Maria. The U.S. Weather Bureau
has been naming its hurricanes ever
since.
Ah, but Queensland can go back
much further. In the ’nineties, Bris-
bane had that world-famed, cantank-
erous meteorologist, Clement Wragge.
He began by giving Greek letters
in alphabetical sequence to his low-
pressure areas. Then he switched to
Greek and Roman mythology. After
that he used female names.
Mr. Wragge was the most brilliant
weather man in the country, but un-
loved by politicians. So frequently he
named cyclones after all the top
political men.
Come the turn of the century he
had two prime ministerial cyclones,
a Barton cyclone, a Deakin cyclone,
and a Drake cyclone, after the reign-
ing Postmaster-General.
Personally, I prefer political
cyclones to female cyclones. They
seem more deserving.

ON THE MARGIN
That Was Eire, That Was
“TRELAND is a thriving modern re-
X public,” I read lately in a news-
paper. If that is the case it must
have changed since I spent my week
there. The Ireland I saw was neither
thriving nor modern, it was just damned
entertaining.
The time was toward the end of the
war. I was in the Air Force in York-
shire, and I had been invited to spend
a week’s leave with Ernst and Peta
Glasesfeld, a charming couple who lived
near Maynooth, a few miles outside
Dublin. Ernst was Austrian and his
wife, formerly Peta Davis, was a Syd-
ney girl. They warned me that I would
not be allowed to enter Ireland in uni-
form, so I borrowed a sports coat and
a pair of flannel trousers for the jour-
ney.
I caught a bus from Dublin to May-
nooth, arriving there about nine o’clock
at night. Maynooth was a small town
of exceedingly Irish character. At one
end of the main street stood the gates
of the Seminary, chief educational
centre for the priesthood; at the other
end stood the gates of the Georgian
mansion of the Duke of Leinster; and
in between were numerous public
houses.
It was very dark when I alighted
from the bus. I peered up at a street
sign, but it was written in the old Irish
language and incomprehensible to me.
I heard noises from a nearby pub and
thought the best way to obtain direc-
tions might be to go inside.
The bar was crowded with men of
a farmerish appearance. I asked for
a glass of Guinness, and when it seemed
opportune I began a conversation with
the men next to me. I said I was a
stranger in those parts, in fact I had
been in Ireland for only two hours.
The effect was startling. The thought
that any person, other than a new-
born infant, could have been in Ire-
land for only two hours seemed remark-
able to them. At once I became the
centre of interest for the whole bar.
When I revealed that I was from the
Air Force in England, a man said
eagerly: “Ye’ve skipped, hev you?” An-
other one laughed and said: “It’s better
to be a coward than a corpse!” I
explained that I was not a deserter
and was merely on leave; but they
remained friendly.
I mentioned I could not understand
the street signs in the Irish language
and asked if that language was much
used. A man said scornfully: “No, it’s
only a plaything for the rich paple.”
Eventually they found me a hire-car
driver who took me to my destination.
Ernst and Peta greeted me warmly and
gave me Jameson’s whisky mixed with
rhubarb juice, a drink I had not tasted
before but found agreeable. Next morn-
ing for breakfast I had two fried duck
eggs. It was the beginning of a week
of exotic eating, drinking, and social
encounters.
The Glasesfelds had interesting
friends, whose conversation was amus-
ing, malicious, and characterised by an
ingrown quality. One sensed that
neutral Ireland was cut off from the
rest of the world, preoccupied with her
own affairs, and at the same time fed
up with her isolation. Though nearly
everyone was gay, the peculiar history
of the country was never far from their
minds. Houses were pointed out to me
where there had been “hidey holes”
in the Troubles.
I was taken to a party at the house
of Erskine Childers, the Minister for
Agriculture. A man there told me that
one of the spies parachuted into Ireland
by the Germans was an Australian. The
spies were . terribly incompetent, he
said, and were all caught.
Pursuing my inquiries about the
Irish language, I was told it was still
spoken in a remote western region, the
Dingle Peninsula. The Government
had sent a young philologist there to
compile a dictionary, but he took to
drinking with the Dingle fishermen
and nothing more was heard from him.
My week passed enjoy ably in a haze
of stout and gossip and “fine soft
days.” One did not have to look far,
however, for evidence that Ireland was
not economically thriving. One after-
noon we pulled up in the pony-cart
at a pub in Maynooth, and a young
man held the horse while we were in-
side. Coming from Britain, with its
manpower shortage, it was odd to see
someone free to perform this task.
My leave was nearly up, and I stood
at the Dublin station waiting for the
boat train. An old lady in a black
shawl was selling religious' tracts. She
noticed I was not an eager buyer and
perhaps suspected me of Protestant
connections. Holding out her tracts,
she said in a rich accent: “They won’t
do you iny harm, sir, aven if they don’t
do you iny good.” The appeal was
irresistible.
I am glad to learn that Ireland is
thriving now and her young men pre-
sumably do not have to hold horses
for a living. But somehow the thought
of Ireland being modernised gives me
no pleasure at all.

“Bring your husbands!”
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
THE piece de resistance of the Bur-
wood Westfield Shoppingtown’s
Gala opening last week was a
display of Mr. Norman Hartnell’s origi-
nal models. Clothes, that is. A thou-
sand guests were invited to the event,
which was a formal black tie affair, and
to partake of an apres-display cham-
pagne buffet.
We posed for complimentary pictures
on the way in, champagne glass in
hand, wandered around the open shops
where staff stood to attention by their
counters in readiness, presumably, for
the next day’s trading. There was a lot
to look at, what with the arrival of
everyone in their evening finery, and
the decor, which was all see-through
glass, wood, and sloping ramps not
forgetting gold and silver plastic balls
shooting up and down in a sort of
fountain. The only one of its kind in
the world, we learnt later. It was all a
bit noisy, but miraculously and unex-
pectedly the sound of baroque music
played by Miss Robin Gurr and her
Arcady Consort Group could be heard
through it all. A nice touch, that.
Promptly at seven-thirty the royal
dressmaker himself arrived and was
ushered under the escalator
into a grey box, on the side
of which a notice read: “NOR-
MAN HARTNELL OF BRU-
TON STREET, LONDON.
W. 1., Temporary Premises
Westfield, Burwood.”
He looked, understandably,
a trifle distrait, but before dis-
appearing from public gaze
we caught sight of what might
be the newest fashion for men:
a signet ring nestling in Mr.
Hartnell’s royal purple silk
handkerchief, which exactly
matched his carnation. It appeared
to be attached, as now and again it
swung like a bell.
Anyway, at eight o’clock when the
Gala was due to begin, a sudden an-
nouncement over the public address
system riveted us to our seats. “Atten-
tion please, attention please. Would the
spotlight electrician report to the rost-
rum.” Soon after, two dozen or so VIPs
arrived, headed by the Premier of New
South Wales, Mr. Askin.
The scene was more or less set for
Mr. Hartnell’s models. From his Tem-
porary Premises, which doubled as a
changing-room, stretched a boomerang-
shaped catwalk covered in royal plum
carpet. Over the archway hung a photo-
graph of the Queen in her younger days
and round her was swathed something
gold which might, or might not, have
been the same material as that swathed
round the Gala’s Golden Girls. No, said
one, their dresses were not Mr. Hart-
nell’s creations, someone called Mona
from the Cross had made them. On the
Hartnell
catwalk stood Mr. Hartnell’s picture,
twice the size of H.R.H., showing him
in soulful mood with chin resting on
hands. On his flip-side, as it were, was a
picture of one Miss Margot Macrae,
who, we were told, was responsible for
his presence in Australia. This display
was later removed. But first . .
But first came the speeches. The
price, it turned out, that we had to
pay for the free beanfeast. This was the
moment for every VIP to extend thanks
to everyone connected with the $8 mil-
lion project, built in under twelve
months, and covering 6| acres. Many,
many people were connected, including
office cleaners and the Water Board
Council, but eventually flowers were
presented to VIP ladies, who then ex-
tended their thanks, and Miss Macrae,
in a Hartnell gown of white skirt and
royal plum sequined top, climbed on
the rostrum.
“Ladies and Gentlemen—Mr. Hart-
nell,” she said. “Direct from London—
the Norman Hartnell collection. This is
the first time high fashion has been seen
in the suburbs of Australia in the
presence of the designer himself.” Mr.
Hartnell inclined his head and from
above the Temporary Premises
two gentlemen in wigs and
period court dress executed a
magnificent fanfare of trum-
pets. The display began.
Mr. Hartnell’s clothes were
pleasant enough. About fifty
garments had been snatched
from his current London win-
ter collection. Miss Macrae
said that was just a few; there
were many, many more to see
if we dropped in on Mr. Hart-
nell next time we visited Lon-
don. She was a mine of infor-
mation about the hats now being worn
by Princess Anne and Princess Margaret
as, indeed, we could see for ourselves if
we cared to call in at the salon, any
time, any day; we would be most wel-
come. She also said, although we might
not believe it, that we could buy from
Hartnell for as little as twenty guineas.
But why not GO to Mr. Hartnell’s salon
at Bruton Street, London W. 1.? “Do not
think it will be elaborate or luxurious
and you will not be welcomed. You
will be,” stressed Miss Macrae, to
make quite sure we understood. Mr.
Hartnell’s staff, all 350 of them, would
love to see us.
Before the evening rounded off we
asked the royal dressmaker what he’d
say if we did all up sticks and surge
into his place as delicately invited by
Miss Macrae?
“I’d say wonderful! Bring your hus-
bands, bring your cheque books and
then—” Mr. Hartnell stared us straight
in the eye, “then I would say good-
bye!”

Saul Bellow on the Writer’s Life
The Pantheon is Full
By JOHN THURSTON
THE papers of that morning had
already told us that Saul Bellow
was a mild, retiring man, content
to say his piece, answer a question or
two, then quietly take his leave; they
seemed a little surprised, probably by
the contrast such normality of behaviour
presents with the desperate posturing
that characterises the London literary
scene. And on the stage of the small
Jeanetta Cochrane theatre Bellow
appeared not retiring but simply nor-
mal, perhaps a little more like a moder-
ately well-off businessman than a highly
successful writer and university lecturer.
He was accompanied by Malcolm
Bradbury, an English author presum-
ably qualified for the job of introduc-
tion by having himself lectured in
American universities and having
written a couple of rather unnote-
worthy novels. Bellow, clad in un-
obstrusive grey, seemed singularly
unflurried by the prospect of casting
his pearls before the immaculately
fashion-conscious audience of three
hundred; while Bradbury, although on
his home ground, was embarrassingly
ill at ease, bearing as he was the
sagging green suit and the look of
pinched and anguished intensity that
are the visible scars of one kind of
intellectual life here,
Fists clenched and lips twisted with
the emotion of the occasion, he un-
burdened himself of the information
that Mr. Bellow was a well-known
writer; in point of fact the author of
six novels, three one-act plays, and
assorted short stories; and that he,
Bradbury, regarded him as one of the
leading moralists of the 20th cen-
tury. Apparently in dire need of re-
assurance on this point, he darted a
fevered glance at the man he was
introducing; but Bellow’s face, sun-
tanned, intelligent, and finely Jewish,
was giving nothing away,
As Bradbury subsided, limp and
sweating, into his seat, the guest arose
and began with a brief, mildly amusing
story about a Russian count who was
giving a lecture on Pushkin and who,
harassed by the effects of alcohol,
managed to explain his subject totally
in one sentence before passing out.
This got a better laugh than it
deserved, which was probably the
audience’s way of letting Bellow know
from the start when it came to
seeing the funny side they were at
least as smart as he was.
He then began to read his lecture
from a small notebook, speaking with
evident authority but in an extremely
neutral tone of voice, almost as though
the words were somebody else’s. The
first writer he had known, he said,
was a retired tool-and-die maker, a
man who wrote stories for “Argosy”
and “True Confessions” in an attempt
to assuage the feelings of guilt he
experienced in staying at home when
everyone else was out at work. Per-
haps there is something of this man’s
sentiment behind every writer; but the
tool-and-die maker is dead, and being
a writer is something else now. So
tonight Bellow wanted to talk about
what it meant to be a writer, or a
would-be writer, in present-day
America.
American public as a whole has
not the slightest interest in the
creative arts, Bellow said, but is suffi-
ciently aware of the need for “cul-
ture” to become disturbed if the
nation’s literary posts are not filled;
so it has come to look upon poets,
novelists, and others with a tolerant
and even kindly eye. Bohemianism now
attracts more disapproval by its
absence, as writers must do what the
public expects if this new “tolerance”
is not to be exhausted. It seems that
there are plenty of “writers” willing
to oblige, and that they are strongly
encouraged to do so by a number of
specifically modern factors. The time
is long past when an ambitious lad
from . Cedar Rapids would trek to
Chicago or St. Louis to work for a
pittance on a newspaper while the
Great American Novel fermented
inside him. Nowadays, the rush is all
to New York, a city which Bellow dis-
trusts deeply, where the overriding
necessity is the 4000 dollars a year
required by the “writer’s life.”
In New York, he says, people are
so overwhelmed by \vhat is expected
of them that literature runs a poor
last to drink, parties, and the right
kind of clothes. Yet the economics of
American publishing tietpand that a
great variety of books be printed and
sold in quantity; and so the “writer’s
life” people, terrified by the idea of
poverty and often too young to be
sure of their aims and capacities,
begin to turn out the work that the
industry demands. New hacks are
born; those to whom writing is some-
thing more than this retreat a step
further; and this gradual retreat has
led them finally into the shelter of the
universities as lecturers or “writers in
residence.”
This represents a considerable change
in circumstances for the American
writer, who has traditionally regarded
and expressed himself as populist, anti-
academic, and often anti-intellectual.
But it is a change, says Bellow, that
reflects, partly at least, the contem-
porary attitude to creative writing. In
the past Hemingway and Sherwood
Anderson, for example, adopted as the

If you’re involved in the soft-drink industry, you should look
now at the advantages of Geon rigid PVC polyvinyl chloride.
Unlike glass, Geon bottles do not shatter if dropped. They weigh
up to 80% less, and can be moulded in practically any shape or
size. Geon bottles are “one-way trippers” there’s no return, no
expensive re-washing. Costs can be cut in labelling, too. Geon
needs no prior preparation before direct printing. Geon rigid vinyl

basis of their self-expression a culti-
vated inarticulateness which met
a definite need at the time, but which
is now a worked-out vein. The writer
of today, reconciled once more to
sophistication of language, finds him-
self less hostile to the academic environ-
ment, especially when it can provide
him with a living and the peace he
needs for his work. Bellow did not
say whether or not he thought that
in the long run any creative person
would come to feel the academic life
dull and restricting; apparently, as he is
a university man, he regards the new
state of affairs as broadly satisfying
from the writer’s viewpoint.
However, he says, this presence of
the writer in circles where, until re-
cently, he has always discussed in
absentia, has had some strange side-
effects; all too often the new literary
academics have brought with them their
own set of affectations, so that one
can now meet Scott Fitzgerald pro-
fessors complete with drinking problem
and nutty wife; other popular models
are James Joyce and Norman Mailer.
Further, the literary hierarchy of the
country has become progressively more
rigid and impenetrable as each univer-
sity stands by its own representatives.
The writers have also become the
critics, and they have decided that “the
pantheon is full.” Under these circum-
stances the avant-garde might seem
the only chance for the unknown
writer, but Bellow doubted whether a
true avant-garde existed in America.
FRIGHTENINGLY competent in all
aspects of his talk so far, Bellow
admitted total uncertainty in attempt-
ing to forecast the future of the novel
in America. In former times, he
thought, the novelist had aimed at
“exposing ideas for conduct to the
sensitive part of the population”; and
maybe, along with Henry James, con-
cerned himself with the “cure of
souls.” But an era of intense subjec-
tivism had changed this, with the
writer now working more intuitively
and Ipss directly; current fiction, im-
pressionistic and scatological, seems
increasingly less occupied with advising
the reader in any way, except, it might
be noted, in regard to his sexual
difficulties. What he did feel sure
of, said Bellow, was that thoughtful
literature would continue to add depth
to the efforts of those of us concerned
with the significance of our presence
here on earth.
Well they may be; the questions
that followed were not. When asked,
by a middle-aged lady of terrifying
naivete, to explain what his books
“meant,” Bellow, repressing a grin,
declined politely on the grounds that
others, notably God, knew more about
them than he did. Then brief, cutting
replies to a couple of turgid “lit-
crit” queries about the function of the
novel sent the audience home, mini-
skirts and all, uncomfortable in the
knowledge that they might get the
jokes but that a good brain would
beat most of them every time.

All airlines have pilots. So why be so proud of ours? Because we know them
right from their very first plane ride. Where other airlines buy pilots,
we train them. From scratch. Even though it takes seven of our 56 plane fleet
to do it. And puts our senior captains into the instructor’s seat.
And keeps our graduate pilots in the co-pilot’s seat. For a year at least.
And logs each of our captains 10,000 hours or more, before they ever see
the flight deck of a DCB. And still they could be 5,000 hours away
from the controls. Of course, they do make the most experienced flight
engineers, navigators and first officers in the business, which is what
we are after. Exactly. But perhaps you think we’re a little extreme.
(Especially if you know how many pilots we lose to other airlines who buy
and don’t train!) But to us it’s worth it. Because it gives us an edge.
A little bit extra to offer all along the line. Even if it’s up front,

“I live near you”
A short story by LESLEY ROWLANDS
AT fifty-seven, and to his complete
surprise, he fell in love for the
first time.
He was, after all, an unusual 57. He
was, for instance, an uprooted 57.
Born in Germany, schooled in Ger-
many, soldiered and worked there, at
55 he had come to Australia, mainly
because his parents had, at last, died,
and because someone had told him it
was the place to go. So he went, alone
and self-sufficient, with enough English
from his schooldays and a draughts-
man’s trade. It wasn’t much. But
enough, in a strange land with very
bright light and a great number of in-
formal people. And very odd beer.
He had no friends, but this did not
worry him, because he had never had
any person close to him. So far as his
memory served him, he had never had
any person close to him.
He settled down in Sydney, went
to English lessons in the evening until
he had improved in the language, lived
alone in a one-room flat, cooked his
own meals, went to and from work and
was not lonely.
Particularly for women he was not
lonely. He had never had a woman in
his life: a fact that worried him only
after one or two beers, when he
was inclined to self-questioning. Usu-
ally, however, it did not worry him, for
he did not regard this lack as abnormal.
He was not, after all, interested in men.
He told himself he was saving himself
for his perfect partner, and, not being
able to recall the physical stirrings of
adolescence, he remained unfrustrated
and untroubled by sexual longings.
in Sydney, were the
dullest part of the week: of his life.
He was not a beach man and in the
sum,mer when everyone else went there
he walked (in his best suit and a hat)
in the gardens admiring the flowers.
In the suburb in which he lived there
were no shops open at weekends and
he had to travel many miles by in-
convenient bus in order to find a
cafe where he could sit and drink
coffee alone.
His name was Hans, but Australians
would have called him this, anyway.
Two years in Australia was long
enough to show him that his life was
empty: he played no sport, did not go
to the races or the beach, did not own
a car, have a house, cultivate a garden.
He was not interested in television or
the theatre and visited the cinema to
see only films made in or about Ger-
many. He had seen two of these in the
two years he had been in Australia. He
decided it was time to take something
up, find some pastime to fill his life.
He was, after all, fifty-seven and very
active.
And so he went back once more to
English classes, this time to ones he
paid for and not to those provided free
by the Government. And this, some-
how, made them seem more difficult.
The class had in it a variety of
nationalities and professions. There were
quite a few Hungarians (for Australia
was a popular place to go to after
the uprising); there were Poles, Finns,
Italians, Greeks, Austrians. There were
three Russians from Russia and four
from China. He was the only German.
It was quite a little United Nations,
, he thought to himself. And everyone
was kind to everyone else. Even the
Hungarians and the Russian Russians
got along quite well, although they did
not speak to each other much. Politics
were not ever mentioned.
Miss Day was responsible for this.
“Politics will not be mentioned in
this classroom,” she said on the first
night. “I have strong feelings about cer-
tain matters, as I am sure you have.
This is a language class and we will
stick to language.”
She was about his own age, tall,
rather weathered by the Australian sun,
very efficient, somewhat didactic. She
was not very good looking, not ugly.
Certainly she was always well groomed,
clean and tidy, and she managed to
use the chalk without surrounding her-
self with a white cloud or getting it
on her hands and clothes. He admired
her immensely for this, being a tidy
man himself.
The lessons seemed to keep pace with
the weather: Interesting, easier topics
were dealt with in the longer summer
and autumn evenings; much more dif-
ficult and, indeed, rather hateful sub-
jects occupied the cold, often wet winter
nights; when the spring and early
summer days lengthened into pleasant
evenings, he found that Miss Day was
being quite jocular and fascinating on
light-hearted matters he had never
suspected could be inherent in a lan-
guage such as English.
And when the lessons were nearing
the end it became light enough to dis-
cern where people went, instead of
watching them plunge out into black-
ness and obscurity.
So he now discovered the bus stop
that Miss Day patronised, and decided
to use it himself, although the bus took
him on a circuitous route to his flat
and he did not arrive home until very
late.
The first night he did this, he merely
raised his hat politely to Miss Day and
then hurried upstairs in the bus so
that she would not think that he was
following her. At this stage he was
barely admitting to himself that he was
following her.
During the next week he thought a
good deal about his behaviour, and his
reasons for taking the same bus as Miss
Day when it was not the right bus for
him at all. He decided that it was
curiosity, as nothing happened when
he looked at Miss Day or thought about
her.
'J'HE following week, when Miss Day
got on her bus, he did not go up-
stairs, but sat two seats behind her, so
that without having to do anything more
than raise his hat to her once more
he was yet in a position to see where
she got off the bus. And to his joy
she alighted at the stop near his favorite
coffee shop and disappeared into a
block of flats next door to it.
He sailed home in the bus feeling
quite light-headed, and forgot to get
himself any supper, for his mind was
occupied by the delightful idea that he
would one day have a cup of coffee in
the company of Miss Day. One day?
Next week!
Miss Day was more than surprised
to be addressed, outside lesson time,
by the German who had been on her
bus for the past two weeks. She tried
to recall his name, and reminded her-
self that she must look it up on the
roll so that, if he were on the bus
next week, she would be able to return
his greeting and use his name. As it was,
she simply responded to his words
(which she didn’t fully understand)
with a muttered conventionality.
“Yes, loyely weather,” she murmured,
hoping thaV-what he had said to her
had had something to do with the
weather. It hadn’t, and he was sur-
prised at her reply.
“Lovely,” he agreed. “You get the
bus?”
“Yes,” she said. “I’ve seen you on
it, too, I believe. Do you live at the
Cross, too?”
“Near it,” he lied, thinking wildly
that he would have to move so that
what he had said would not be a lie.
“Very convenient,” she said, fitting
her gloves on to her fingers.
He didn’t know what else to say,


and for a moment wondered what he
was doing there, with this rather plain
woman, getting on a bus that was not
his at all. Then he remembered the
coffee shop and the loneliness of the
many cups he had drunk there by
himself.
“How about a cup of coffee?” He
asked, using the Australian colloquial-
lism, although these were not the words
he would normally use.
“I beg your pardon?” She genuinely
had not understood him.
“It gives me great pleasure if you
wish to come with me to drink coffee,”
he answered. This was his own
phraseology, and she understood him.
There was a pause, while she thought
of her washing, the breakfast dishes, the
English papers she had to correct, how
tired she was, and how long it was
since a man had asked her to do any-
thing with him.
“How nice,” she said. “Where?”
“I thought here . . .” The bus
had drawn up near his coffee shop.
“Why, this is just next door to my
flat,” she said. “And do you know,
I’ve never set foot inside it!” She
might have added that this was be-
cause it looked so dark and sinister,
and was run by new Australians, but
she remembered who she was with,
and stopped herself in time.
“Neither have I!” he cried gaily,
falling in with what he took to be her
spirit of adventure. But he regretted
this lie when they entered and he was
greeted by George, the Austrian waiter,
and by the proprietor, Peter.
“So long since we seen you, Hans.
Where you been, Frederick asks after
you last night only.”
“I was busy,” he growled, showing
Miss Day to a table. “I used to come
here once,” he said, waving his hand
to indicate that this had happened
when he was a boy. “Clean forgot,” he
added, smiling at her.
JUST as Miss Day had suspected, it
was difficult to see anything inside
the cafe, which was lit with a few smok-
ing candles. All the women looked
pretty in this light, and the men darker
than they actually were, and very
mysterious. She put her Land up and
patted her hair, hoping that the grey
hairs were hidden in the gloom. They
were.
Miss Day really looked nice in this
light, he decided. Soft and feminine. He
wondered if it would be possible to
keep her there for ever, both of them
growing old in the dimness over coffee
and conversation.
“What may I offer you?” he asked,
pushing the menu toward her. He knew
he wanted apfelstrudel and Vienna
coffee, both of which were good here.
He may even have some chocolate
cake as well, just something as a light
snack before he went home and cooked
a proper evening meal for himself.
“Oh, only coffee, thank you. I
couldn’t eat anything at this time of
night.” It was nine o’clock. He won-
dered, briefly, if she were mad.
“Milk coffee, if I may. And rather
weak, otherwise I won’t sleep. Lots
of milk.”
He passed on this remarkable order
to the waiter, and decided not to eat,
either, although his stomach was
rumbling and demanding food.
“We all enjoy the lessons you give
us,” he said while they were waiting
for their coffee. She smiled in response
and he felt a slight pain over his
heart. It wasn’t a marvellous smile, he
reasoned with himself, not a young
smile, but it was for him, and no one
ever smiled just for him. Hadn’t ever,
so far as he could remember.
“I enjoy teaching you all,” she said.
She wondered about this man, this
German. Wondered why he’d asked
her to coffee. He must be lonely, she
decided, it wouldn’t be anything else.
To her surprise, she felt no pang about
this, which must mean that she was
now past the time where every man
she met was measured as a potential
mate. It was a period that had taken
a long time to go through.
Lonely, she thought. He’s lonely.
“You must be lonely out here, or is
your family with you?”
“I have no family. I am here alone.
I am busy, you realise. I have my
job, my English lessons, my hobby.”
This led nowhere, but their coffee
came and they fussed for a time over
the sugar.
“And your work?” he asked. “Always
do you teach English to people like
me?”
She said, “I do that only part-time,
one night a week. My full-time job is
. . . well . . . guess what I do?” The
darkness in the cafe was making her a
little arch.
He had guessed long ago. Knew,
without the slightest degree of doubt,
that she was a schoolteacher.
“A receptionist?” he ventured, and
was rewarded by another smile. “Or a
florist, perhaps, spending your days
amongst flowers.”
“Not exactly.” Romantic man? She
couldn’t bring herself to tell him that
she spent her days amongst grubby
children in chalky classrooms. “I’m
a dress material designer.”
“Ah, an artist! I knew it! Your
hands . . .” They both looked at her
hands, square and practical, lying on
the table between them. He leaned
over and touched one of her fingers
with his own. They both jumped as if
they’d been stung by a wasp.
“I am a designer of sorts, too,” he
said, to cover his own and her con-
fusion at the meeting of fingers. “An
architect.” He had forgotten that he had
filled in a form, stating his occupation
as draughtsman, which he had given to
her at the beginning of the classes.
“And what do you build?” she asked.
“Oh . . . houses . . .” He waved his
hand airily, “libraries . . .”
“In the war,” she said, for she had
to know, “did you . . . fight?”
“I was forced to,” he replied, trying
to remember why he had been in the
army in the first place. Had he volun-
teered or been drafted? It was difficult
to remember. He preferred to think
and wanted her to think, it was the
latter. He had never felt very strongly
one way or the other about the war.
“And I suppose,, although you were
forced to fight, you were very national-
istic, wanted Germany to win?”
This was important to her, he could
see. She had leaned forward and her
face, closer to his, was tense.
“I didn’t like it,” he said. “I didn’t
like the war and what was happening.
I was on your side,” he added, seeing
that he was saying what she wished to
hear. “From the first. I was com-
pletely pro-British.” Having told so
many little lies, one more did not
matter. Maybe, he thought, it wasn’t a
lie. Maybe he had been pro-British. It
was so hard to recall, because he had
never been very strongly pro-anything.
Except pro-Miss Day, here in this dim,
kind light.
“J KNEW it,” she cried. “I always
knew there were people in Germany
who thought as we did, who were, in
fact, as you say, on our side.” She sat
back in her chair, beaming. “I am very
bitter about Germany,” she added.
“Bitter?” He was surprised into near-
anger but, remembering he had been
on her side, the other side, he said:
“Ah, bitter. Yes, of course.”
“I lost a very dear friend in the
war. Fighting against the Germans in
the Middle East. A very dear friend.”
She tried to remember what this very
dear friend had looked like, been like,
but could not. “We were madly in love
with each other,” she lied, wondering
what made her behave in this extra-
ordinary planner.
He wanted to imagine her as a girl,
a young man in love with her. This
was hard to do; she carried no bloom
of youth about her now. But he liked
her as she was, and knew that if he
had met her when she was young he
would not have wanted to offer her
coffee, speak to her, even.
“Would you care for some more
coffee?” I understand what you are
saying, dreaming, he was telling her
with these words. And she knew at
once what he was trying to say.
“No, thank you. I must go now.” Her
voice was as gentle as his.
“May I see you to your door?”
“Well, I’m just next door. Thank
you.”
“And perhaps we could walk in the
gardens on Sunday?”
It was not an invitation she had
ever had before, but she accepted it
gratefully, and her gratitude was not
only for the asking that had come so
late in her life.
“And you live near here, you said?”
“Quite near. Perhaps, too, we could
meet for coffee again sometime?”
“Perhaps!” She was quite overcome
with what seemed to her a veritable
avalanche of invitations. “Although,”
she added, “I am very busy.”
It was the last little lie, and they
went their separate ways thinking of
how to make the lies into truths before
they met again.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Devils at the WEA
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“Curse of the Demon”: the devil-worshipper has his comeuppance on the railway
tracks.
ONE of the chief problems for film
enthusiasts in Australia has been
the lack of a National Film
Theatre or Museum of Modern Art
where the great films of the past can be
seen historically over long periods; this
is a gap that the National Film Library
here should certainly extend itself to
fill. A cinema attached to the library
could well assemble, from overseas
sources, say, two seasons a year of
historic works chronologically arranged;
the fact is that at present most of our
resident critics are very uninformed
about the major silent and early sound
masterpieces, and therefore are unable
to place their comments on contempor-
ary work in any kind of satisfactory
context.
The film clubs and societies do a
heroic job, especially in Victoria, but
of necessity they cannot arrange films
in substantial groups under specific
headings. For this reason, one should
welcome all the more warmly an
attempt made by the Workers’ Educa-
tional Association in Sydney to devise
weekends of film in specialised areas,
and encourage discussions among
students and outside visitors.
The president of the present film
group at the WEA, Robert Mills, filled
in the picture for me at a recent meet-
ing. Film study weekends had been
held at Newport, N.S.W., in which
the Western, thrillers, and the myth-
ology and reality of the cinema had
been illustrated by samples of films
and talked about by uninitiated and
initiated film enthusiasts. A special
Eisenstein season was prepared. In
addition to these extra-curricular meet-
ings, courses were held in appreciation
of the cinema, and Douglas White and
John Morris of the Commonwealth
Film Unit and Sylvia Lawson, among
others, had given series of lectures
designed to sharpen the knowledge of
the man in the street. All this is
admirable; and far too little recog-
nised. And the weekend before last a
special showing of fantasy films was
arranged by the young and successful
science-fiction writer John Baxter.
The title of the series was “The
Dream Machine,” and in a clear and
precise introductory talk Mr. Baxter
outlined the traditions of the fantasy
film, from Melies and his fantasies
about journeys to the moon, through
the German Golem monster story to
“Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” with its
bizarre distorted corridors, coffin,
somnambulist killer, and evil brooding
doctor, and hence to the recreations
of vampire legends. (One weakness
of the talk was that it did not suffi-
ciently point out the literary origins
of this material, almost all of which
was adaptive rather than creative.)
Baxter then moved on to discuss ver-
sions of the “Hands of Orlac” story —
from a French novel on which one
would have welcomed some comment —
about a man whose dismembered hands
are replaced by those of a murderer
following an accident. And, of course,
the variants of Mary Shelley’s
“Frankenstein” —and the flesh-grafting
theme as a whole.
The talk was illustrated by excerpts
from James Whale’s delightful “The
Bride of Frankenstein”: Elsa Lan-
chester as the manufactured girl with
the tall crinkled busby of hair made
up to wed the monster while the
epicene scientist Di;. Pretorius voyeuris-
tically smacks his lips over the forth-
coming nuptials. But the bride rejects
the monster, who, frustrated, blows up
the whole menage sky high, his pros-
pective wife uttering a long splendid
indrawn hiss of horror at the end of
her briefest of brief lives. The whole
episode—kites spun high to attract the
lightning above the mill, the flashing
blades of fire racing down the spiralled
mechanism to the pulsing unwilling
brain—was inventive in a way which
Mary Shelley herself would have liked.
the features shown were
Robert Wise’s splendid “The Haunt-
ing,” whose theme of sexual frustration
is intriguingly linked with the polter-
geist phenomena tormenting a mansion
and its occupants, “Forbidden Planet,”
an unusually ritzy excursion into
science-fiction, and “Curse of the
Demon.” Directed by Jacques Tour-
neur, this superb version of a story by
M. R. James, the late Provost of Eton,
dealt with the diabolist activities of
Carswell, a tweedy middle-aged
mother’s boy kept in style in a mansion
by his league of terrified devil wor-
shippers; he is finally taken by the
devil himself on a railway station some-
where between Clapham Junction and
Southampton.
One particularly brilliant scene in-
volves a cataleptic member of the
diabolist’s circle subjected to hypnosis
in a gathering of psychologists to dis-
cover the dreadful secret he carries
around with him: the uneasy waiting
rows of doctors, the needle thrust into
a flabby relaxed arm, the tranced man’s
eyes fixed and dead, and his sudden
leap and scream into the scattering
audience: here was direction of a
masterly urgency and control.

he is born to the military aristocracy,

Peppard finds his path unexpectedly
smooth: it suits the books of the Ger-
man High Command to push the
aggressive pilot on his way—he is used
by them with as much calculation as
he brings to his own dealings with
authority.
Guillermin sees to it that the film
belts smartly along, never losing
impetus throughout its considerable
length. The plot, though intricate, is
not diffusely prolix, the dialogue is
always to the point—often sharply so.
Guillermin handles his actors like a

James Mason co-operate impressively.

Some of the more knowing overseas
film journals have professed great
enthusiasm for an obscure German
thriller, “The Terrible People,”
apparently on the principle that it puts
you one-up to admire something no-
body else has ever heard of. To hear
them tell it, it’s practically a second
“Caligari,” but it turns out to be
merely amateurish and silly, and dub-
bed into almost incomprehensible Eng-
lish. Based on an Edgar Wallace novel,
it’s that venerable chestnut about the
condemned man who vows vengeance
on all those responsible for his down-
fall, after which they start mysteriously
dropping like flies, generally in almost
total darkness. The main action takes
place in a couple of papiermache
stately homes and during Golf Week
at a hotel called the Braeside, or Hay-
seed—that soundtrack! —which is so
unbearably elegant that the male guests
and even the policemen on duty come
to dinner in white tie and tails.

THEATRE
Caught in the Draft
Private Yuk Objects. Alan Hopgood.
Union Theatre Repertory Company.
Phillip Theatre, Sydney.
Twelfth Night. William Shakespeare.
Channel 2, Sydney.
AS a dramatised discussion of Aus-
tralian attitudes to the Vietnam
war and conscription, “Private
Yuk Objects” is a muddle. The intel-
lectual level of the discussion is pre-
saged by the newspaper headlines,
flashed on a screen before the play
begins, which blatantly pander to Left
Wing prejudices. The muddle is indi-
cated by the fact that the outcome of
the play would satisfy the most con-
servative member of the RSL.
Hoth Yuk lives with his father, Yuk,
VC, in fairytale country high up on
the Baw Baw Mountains, where God
is near, right and wrong are sharply
distinguished, and duty is plain. They
have neither newspaper nor radio, but
young Yuk’s call-up gets through, and
he sets out for Melbourne with his
horse and his kangaroo gun to win
another VC.
In Melbourne, Private Yuk becomes
the guest of Henry McKay, member
of Parliament, whose life was saved by
Daddy Yuk. After the certainties of
the mountain, the confusions of the
sophisticated city are endless. Henry’s
son Tony has just burnt his draft card,
and Henry threatens to turn him out of
the house unless he revises his opinions
within seven days. Henry is an old-
fashioned authoritarian who holds that
the Government have wiser heads than
the rest of us. Although this view was
recently expressed by some Anglican
bishops, it is not, I believe, widely
held. In fact, Tony does change his
attitude, but we are given no satisfac-
tory reasons why he burnt his draft
card nor why he retrieved it from the
ashes.
Meanwhile, away in Vietnam, Cap-
tain Peter McKay is captured lay the
Viet Cong in the shape of Vo Lai, who
was once a medical student at Sydney
University, and Chi, a beautiful Viet-
namese girl. Like Dr. No when he cap-'
tures James Bond, Vo is delighted to
have the opportunity of an informal
chat with his adversary, and even
throws in Chi as an inducement. But,
as a loyal Australian who is determined
not to be brainwashed, the Captain
confines his conversation to remarks
like “Get nicked!”
Back in Melbourne, Private Yuk is
successfully brainwashed by the beauti-
ful Jeannie, Henry McKay’s under-
graduate daughter, who carefully ex-
plains to him that God is dead and
turns him into an anti-conscriptionist.
But Daddy Yuk strides down from the
mountain, straightens out the city
sophisticates, and recalls his son to the
path of duty. Since he does this off-
stage, we will never know how he does
it.
This extraordinary mixture of farce,
fairytale, and fuzzy thinking is well pre-
sented under the direction of John
Sumner by a skilful cast, with David
Turnbull outstanding as Private Yuk.
Ken Hannam’s lively production of
“Twelfth Night” for ABC television
achieved a high standard of acting,
diction, and intelligence. Both the
theatrical business and the cinematic
business were well planned to bring
out the meaning and shape of the play.
Helen Morse as the lovely Olivia and
Judith Fisher as the sea-changed Viola
gave delightful and well-matched per-
formances. In spite of some miscasting
John Gray lacked the ebullience of
Sir Toby, and Malvolio and Feste
should have changed places the
acting was of a thoroughly professional
standard.

ART
Poetic Bushland
Fred Williams. Rudy Komon Gallery,
Sydney.
IT’S not so much the superb skill
with which Fred Williams distils
the spirt of Australia’s ancient
hills, black dams, graceless foliage, and
awkward ashen tree - trunks that
astonishes, but his creative acceptance
of what others find inhibiting: our
landscape’s monotonous drabness, in-
finite repetitiveness, and predict-
ability.
The stark horizon, the arid, hum-
drum plains, the endless array of trees,
the panoramas of ochre and brown are
transformed into an art both intimate
and remote. No other Australian
painter has caught the tender feelings
that the dried bushland of haphazard
trees can evoke. Williams’ remote
intimacy is almost Chinese in its mix-
ture of immediate gesture, of spon-
taneous notation, with contemplation
and serenity.
“Hillside Landscape,” the most
daring if such a word can be used
of a painter so poised and restrained
work in the exhibition is the most
oriental: the balls of foliage and tree-
trunks are dispersed with casual care-
fulness over a sandy, golden back-
ground that is both earth and sky,
only a line of trees marking the hori-
zon. His sheer Gestaltian skill is
exemplified in the fallen tree - trunk
which presages the horizon. The eye
wanders so unimpeded through the
quiet pauses between the trees that the
painting has an eternal, dream-like air.
Sometimes Williams imposes a strict
order on the landscape; “Hummock In
Landscape” hoists a severely symmetri-
cal brown hill, its black trees swirling,
against a dull panorama, where the
trees begin to disintegrate with centri-
fugal force.
This classical association of compact
areas of energy usually whirlwinds
of foliage with ample, formal
organisation is most drastic in “Oval
Landscape,” where an area of smoky
turbulence is surrounded by bare, white
canvas, as though Williams were resist-
ing a pull toward expressionism. In-
deed, a black pond that invades the
side of one painting, sinks a menacing
hole in the red that is “Water Pond
Landscape II,” and in the third in this
series the blackness resists a vast area
of orange.
J£E is best, however, when he
tempers violence with restraint in
“Chopped Trees,” where balls of
foliage drift off fallen trunks scattered
over greenish-yellow grass. The thick
impasto of the foliage, like life in its
last throes, has a gnarled, weathered
yet lush look. No ordinary axeman
could have laid waste with such
fortuitously beautiful placement.
Mr. Williams can be a little too
harmonious: in “Landscape in Upwey”
the trees are a trifle orderly, the brown
land rather velvety the habitat of
the dryad rather than the bunyip; but
another version of this landscape has
black trees gyrating with a much less
polished vigor. In “Lysterfield Land-
scape” the reddish trees draw the whole
terrain into their convolutions and at
the horizon branches are flung against
the still sky.
The skies are usually cool, drained of
color, both palely tender and implac-
ably remote; they often, by contrast,
give the landscape an excited disorder
that, viewed by itself, it doesn’t have.
This is especially so in “Green Cloud
and Owl” (which has just won the
W. D. & H. O. Wills $lOOO prize), where
a mere wisp of a cloud, a pale green
vaporous smudge, floats in the pallid
sky like a timid visitor. Below, the
landscape \is given a treatment that is
rare in Williams; the dark blue and
purple smouldering areas are punctua-
ted by tree - trunks that are slabby
verticals in paler blues or black. It’s
sometimes hard to tell if Williams is a
restrained lyricist with a violent expres-

A car capable of accelerating ferociously
up to 105 m.p.h. does not at first appear to
be a candidate for safety awards. Yet the
fact is that the Rover 2000 has been hailed
by every motoring writer or authority of note
throughout the world as the safest car of our
time. Our own "Wheels” magazine calls it
“the world’s finest argument against the
people who would eliminate all fast cars”.
The American "Car and Driver” says:— “If
every car on the road were as good as this
one, they could raise every speed limit in the
country fifteen miles an hour and still have a
reduced accident rate”. The British “Auto-
mobile Association”, in presenting the
Rover 2000 with its top safety award, says,
simply, “its high degree of inherent safety is
much in advance of its time and has set the
pattern for future design”. What does this
mean to you? It means w, i.an
$5OOO, you get three cars in one:
HOW COME A CAR
AS HOT AS THE
ROVER
2000
WINS ALL THE
SAFETY MEDALS ?
(1) A sedate luxury sedan, magnificently
rich in the creature comforts. (2) A hairy-
chested sports car that makes you itch to
take it out of the garage at the slightest
excuse. (3) The safest production car in the
world. With the help of the world-renowned
motoring magazine “Autocar”, we’ve pro-
duced a chart listing an astonishing fifty
safety features designed into the Rover
2000 (no other production car in the wide
world offers you all of them; few offer even
a dozen). As this chart could be instrumental
in saving your life one day, we’d very much
like you to send for it. Better still, how about
a ride in a Rover? We guarantee it will be the
most luxurious, the most exhilarating and
the safest of your life. Your Rover dealer

if he summons his powers at will to
interpret what lies before him.
Upstairs at the gallery, where there
are water colors, gouaches and etchings,
Williams is mainly the lyricist a
quite oriental one in the seemingly
unpremeditated dispersal of notations
in the etchings and an ecole-de-Paris
one in “Hummock in Landscape II”
where the trees have a gay levitation
that results in the tree trunks following
the foliage into the sky in “Gum Trees
in a Landscape.” Williams is never so
earthbound as to need such fantasy;
fantasy always seems to be for him the
expression of a secondary emotion, an
elaboration. Williams, with a primordial
landscape as his subject, presents
simple, clear, and basic feelings; he
presents not so much a new vision of
the landscape (logic if the vision of
the landscape is not identical with the
landscape, then what are the differ-
ences?), but a set of feelings about it
that are so personal and universal that
he is undoubtedly a most significant
artist .
ELWYN LYNN
BALLET
A chorus in nightshirts
Inbal Dancers. Palais Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
THIS company is advertised as the
Israeli Inbal Ballet Company, a
title which is extremely mislead-
ing, since it is neither representative
Israeli, nor is it ballet. Australians
cannot be expected to know that
Yemenites are a small minority group
in the new state of Israel; the pro-
gram here is produced and performed
entirely by this minority. Israelis are
a polyglot people with highly sophisti-
cated tastes in artistic matters. After
all, many of them can draw directly
on any number of Western cultures
to whose development they contributed
for nearly two thousand years. The
Inbal company, in complete contrast, is
a limited presentation of the primitive
culture of the only genuine ancestors
of Jewry, the Yemenites. To call their
art “Israeli” is like presenting a cor-
roboree as the Australian Ballet.
The artists, singers, dancers, and
musicians of Inbal are at all times
first-class, though they lack the pre-
cision and discipline we expect of pro-
fessionals. They are drawn mostly from
Arab countries, though they are resi-
dents of Israel now, a fact which is
surprising in view of their magnificent
physiques. One does not normally think
“My Land” and “Wild Rose.” Two dances from the Inbal repertoire.
of tall, beautiful women and men
among these races.
The balletic aspects of the company
are more of a liability than an asset.
There is a certain charm in the folk
dancing and singing of these very attrac-
tive people, but the deliberate choreo-
graphing of each item by one person
results in sheer visual monotony. Miss
Levi-Tanai is following vaguely in the
long-forgotten footsteps of Laban and
his pupils Mary Wigman and Kurt Jooss.
Her original ballets are by far the
weakest part of the program. Only
one, “My Land”, has any bearing on the
creation of Israel and in its confusion is
notable for one thing only. It does
answer the perennial old army question:
“Do you know what you can do with
your rifle?” Miss Levi-Tanai finds some
extraordinary uses for such a simple
weapon.
The most entertaining moments are
typical Yemeni rather than Jewish
items. “Debka” is a genuine Bedouin
folk dance, attractively dressed. The
“Shepherds’ Dance” also appears to be
Arabic in origin. Both succeed because
they need no story line for their enter-
tainment value. The rest of the program
suffers heavily because, as in all primi-
tive modes of music, the sung word
provides the key to the proceedings.
There can be no question, however,
that an evening with the Inbal com-
pany is interesting and educational. Any
member of the Jewish faith should see
and hear the traditions of his true
forefathers. Anyone interested in eth-
nic art as well must also see the show.
And, as usual, there is some virtuoso
playing of rare instruments to interest
any good musician.
The crucial deficiency is most clearly
seen in the longest and most interesting
item, “Yemenite Wedding.” This should
be absolutely fascinating in its wealth
of detail, showing not only the old
marriage customs but also the lengthy
preliminaries. The characters are sym-
pathetic, the costumes and setting are
genuine, if not sumptuous, and the
difference between our ideas of a wed-
ding and that of a Yemenite Jewish
tribe is almost unbelievable.
Unhappily, the whole thing has been
“improved” for stage presentation with-
out any theatrical skill whatever. Only
the obviously earnest sincerity of the
performers overcomes the ludicrousness
of a chorus line of bearded men in
nightshirts performing an earnest hop-
skip-and-jump. There is a big difference
in performing a communal dance as a
community function in privacy and
re-arranging it in this manner for
audience consumption, especially when
it is preceded by an earnest female
droning a typical Fitzpatrick travel
talk in painfully slow English over an
abominable amplification system. The
program states that the ceremonies
last seven days. It certainly felt like it.

BOOKS
The Unshielded Eye
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Other Half. Judith Wright. Angus
and Robertson. $1.95.
JUDITH WRIGHT has always
tended to arrange her books
thematically, and in her new col-
lection, “The Other Half,” two themes
predominate: poetry and death. Man,
the interpreter of the universe, is poised
against man, the victim of his own
self-destructive tendencies.
The theme of poetry occurs in dif-
ferent ways. First, and most obviously,
in the series of informal, personal
tributes to other poets —to Hafiz, of
Shiraz, to John Blight and to the elusive
genius of John Shaw Neilson, both the
subjects of admiring essays in Miss
Wright’s recently published “Pre-
occupations in Australian Poetry.”
Those familiar with Miss Wright’s
work know that the special qualities
of the poetic vision have always deeply
concerned her, both in prose and verse,
and sometimes preoccupied her at the
expense of the technical means by
which this vision is given form.
Although she has written of the poet
as maker, she is more interested in
the poet as visionary and seer and with
the loss of poetic vision in the modern
world. In this she is much more like
A. D. Hope than has yet been observed
—though where for Hope poetry is
associated with the will and power for
Miss Wright it is associated with being,
wise passiveness, “the unshielded eye,”
the humanising of the world.
Thus Hope’s emphasis on poetry as
technique and architecture; and Miss
Wright’s concern for the fluid, the
lyrical, the moment of vision beyond
technique. Miss
Wright long ago
entered Blake and
Raine country; and
she reflects, by par-
ticipating in it, one
of the paradoxes of
poetry which uses
words to talk
about things which
lie beyond words.
One only fears that
what has happened
with many poets
might happen to
her: that her search
will lead her be-
yond words al-
together.
The necessity for
words and poets is,
I take it, the theme
of “New Guinea
Legend”; and it
recurs in the intri-
cat e 1 y arranged
Judith Wright
“Cleaning Day,” with its striking stanza
(“High the heap grew;/I struck the
match and blew/while the flame sulked
against the idle air”) and its reference
to the renewing fire of inspiration that
cleanses and refines; or in “Clock and
Heart,” which, again, like the “New
Guinea Legend,” emphasises the special
“solitudes” of poetry. Other poems like
“Remembering an Aunt,” something of
a companion piece to “Request to a
Year” in “The Two Fires,”/touch the
theme of art and poetry less directly:
I praise her for her silence and her
pride;
art lay in both. Yet in her all the same,
sometimes there sprang a small
unnoticed flame —
grief too unseen, resentment too denied.
Poetry and the poetic vocation is the
theme, too, of some of the most
poignant pieces in this book —and this
is probably Miss Wright’s most personal
book —poems about her own poetic
gifts like “Beside the Creek”: “years,
time, you hoarsen here a throat/that
sang all day without suspecting you.”
There is unflinching honesty in the way
these pieces face both the inadequacies
of inspiration and the sad unreliability
of the poetic force itself, the flickerings
of vision. But “Prayer” rises above the
facts it faces to become a Shelleyean
affirmation of spirit in front of the
destructive powers of time:
While every flower swings open its
eternal door
and every fruit encloses its timeless
seed
let me not watch in spite, caring no
more,
but let my heart’s
old pain tear me
until I bleed.
Out in the dark, I
know, sing a
thousand voices;
and the owl, the
poet’s bird, and
the saint’s white
moth
blunder against my
window, the frog
in the rain re-
joices.
I pledge to the
night and day my
life’s whole truth.
The condemna-
tion of poetry which
is about poetry has
become one of the
most predictable
cliches of modern
criticism. It is, how-
ever, worth noting,


as Frank Kermode and others have per-
sistently pointed out, that this is one
of the most striking aspects of modern-
ism; and it cannot be easily dismissed
as mere aestheticism. This is not a
subject to go into here; but I think it
is significant that for all the poems
Miss Wright has about poets and poetry
one would never think of calling her
work aesthetic in this particular sense.
Her interest in art is inseparable from
her interest in man as a spiritual being,
and in his possibilities and achieve-
ments; and it is no less or more intense
than her interest in the actual physical
world man inhabits and is slowly
destroying (“A Document,” “Turning
Fifty”). Poetry at the service of life is
her concern and not life for poetry’s
sake.
If Miss Wright is much concerned
with poetry she is as much possessed
by death. The sharp awareness of
mortality that is at the heart of poetry
has here become an acute personal
problem. In the past Miss Wright
tended to project myths against the
void. She has shown man naming the
stars, fixing the frontiers of nothing-
ness and bringing the world under the
dominion of knowledge and art. Here
the note is more personal. There is a
sense of a very real fight against the
forces of negation and despair and the
various guises of death itself in a
reiterated effort to show an affirming
flame.
“Child With a Dead Animal” is
one of the most impersonal statements
of the theme of the consciousness of
death and the sacramental quality of
the knowledge it offers:
The thing you saw set your eyes
running tears
faster than words could tell:
the creature changed to thing, kind-
ness to dread,
the live shape chilled, forsaken, left
for dead —-
these crowded up to blind your eyes;
these fell
and fell till it seemed you’d wash
away with tears
the glimpse you’d had of death
and clear it from your heart. It
was not true.
The sight you saw had found its
home in you.
“To a Mare” ends: “Say Death I do
not know . . ./Tell her who rode me
last/death’s only nothing;/death has no
taste at all.” Here we are at the centre
of Miss Wright’s preoccupation: the fact
that death is a peculiarly and exclu-
sively human problem (“Pro and
Con”).
One of the questions Miss Wright- has
always wrestled with is that of abstrac-
tion. She hasn’t ignored it in favor
of imagistic notations nor given it up
for the self-regarding rhetoric of the
pseudo-personal. Her ability, which
she learned from Rilke, to turn an
abstraction into a poetic reality is seen
at its best here in the very Leishman-
Rilkean “Sculpture”:
The obstinate block, mere weight,
oppressed his hands /
That sought and failed to find what
lay within —
oppressed his heart that could not
compass it.
The shape that waited there was
future, fate,
the word he had not learned, the
thing that stands
around the corner that we cannot
turn.
He left it where it stood, and went
away.
Humped in its shroud of future it
remained
until its hour and his at last came
round.
His time, its space, full circle met
that day;
and for their marriage hammer and
chisel rang
strokes that, like notes, upon the
marble sang.
But Miss Wright’s handling is not
always as sure as this; and in poems
like “City Sunrise” the abstractions
fail to quicken into poetic life.
“The Other Half” has then some
thematic unity. It has the variability
and variety of Miss Wright’s later work,
and the changes from the early Judith
Wright to the later are as pronounced
now —and of the same kind—as those
between the early and the later Robert
Lowell. Small poems like “Power,”
“Wishes,” and the Blakean “The
Trap” continue in the vein that “Birds”
made especially clear; and there are
several notable “domestic,” marginal
poems —slight sardonic pieces (like
“Portrait”) of a kind not new in Miss
Wright’s work, though the image of her
as the poet of the modern apocalypse
has tended to foster some neglect of this
side of her output.
“The Other Half” is not a book that
will alter the present critical estimates
of Judith Wright’s work. One of its
own implicit themes is the author’s
lament at not having found the richest
and deepest sources of renewal. There
are no poems here of the dimension of
“The Harp and the King” or of the
exquisitely sustained texture of “Bul-
locky” or “The Bull.” But the book
is graced throughout with poetic felici-
ties and moments of exceptional verbal
delight and wonder, as in the lovely
baroque virtuosity of “Water”:
Such sentences, such cadences of
speech
the tonguing water stutters in its race
as may have set us talking each to
each
before our language found its proper
pace;
or in the brilliant “Camping at Split
Rock”:
Each curve has words;
each flight speaks its own bird. The
slowly strong
deep thrusting heron’s stroke; the
glittering
daring rush of the swallow and the
long
poise and turn of hawk on a still
wing.
The Secular
However you look at it,
The abundant secular,
How splendid it all appears
Shifting and coruscating
All over and everywhere,
All at once, repeatedly,
In little waves of motion
And stubbornly tangible.
Look, I grant all that you say:
Whoever the creator
He brutally botched the job,
But how tough his furniture
Really is made, piece by piece!
I jump on his solid stones
Or dance on these rustling fields
And hear the sap leap in trees
Already marked out for death.

encourages one to approach the sub-
ject from many different angles.
One might want to explore the
language of squatting and farming, of
the bush, the underworld or the city,
of sport or war, fashions or politics.
No matter which point of entry one
chooses, there are always more re-
wards at the journey’s end than one
expects. History, literature, politics,
exploration and customs come alive in
the language invented or adapted to
record them.
Other more general aspects of Mr.
Baker’s work, however, demand atten-
tion. I found myself particularly in-
terested in three issues. The first is
a commonplace for philologists.
Though the history of the Australian
language is so short, there is con-
siderable evidence already of changes
in usage, and of the decline or
virtual disappearance of certain words
and expressions. The admittedly
special case of war slang illustrates this
point very well. Mr. Baker lists some
600 expressions which were in use dur-
ing World War 11, and estimates that
of these only about fifty are in general
use today. What determines the sur-
vival of an expression, or its elevation
to what Mr. Baker calls “an ‘approved’
level”?
With the warning that views about
standard and non-standard language
cannot be carried too far, Mr. Baker
suggests that many of the expressions
which are now essential to the Aus-
tralian community “are free from the
taint of earthiness which apparently
has to be eroded away from a collo-
quialism before it is accepted as a
‘norm’.” Yet it is the very earthiness
of spoken language which gives it life
and color, and which, one might argue,
nourishes a country’s literature. So
that while phrases and expressions
might be denied respectability by
educated speakers, they might well in-
fluence, however directly, the more
permanent language of literature. (One
thinks, of course, of Synge collecting
language, as it were, to use in the
theatre.)
The second issue rises directly out
of Mr. Baker’s study of the language,
but one can hardly blame him for not
discussing it at length, since this would
certainly take him outside the limits
of his present task. At the same time,
I could wish that the section on “Our
Idiom in Literature” were more satis-
factory. It pays a suitable tribute to
the remarkable influence of THE
BULLETIN in its early years, and
to its championship of local idiom. Yet
one really wants to know more on the
subject of literary metaphor than that
certain writers have used, or have failed
to use, local idiom in various ways.
Mr.' Baker’s point about non-Australian
metaphors which can actually inter-
fere with one’s understanding of an
Australian scene is well taken. His
suggestions about how writers can
“freshen up” their imagery are worth
attention.
He does, however, largely beg the
Sidney J. Baker
difficult question of value. Although
he distinguishes between literary and
popular metaphor in terms of the
“terser and less imaginative” quality
of the latter, his examples are by no
means always persuasive. For instance,
it is not at all clear to me that there
is a particular virtue in the simile “the
men stood close together . . . like sheep
huddling together for warmth”; and
the expressions “a nose so broad and
flat that an emu could scratch gravel
in it” and “(a dog) barking and spin-
ning in the dust like a berserk bunyip”
seem to me so contrived that they
lose the very quality for which one
prizes imaginative use of language—
the sense of surprising rightness. In
other words, the relationship between
a vigorous colloquial idiom and a rich
language of imaginative literature is
by no means as simple as Mr. Baker
seems to suggest, though he has cer-
tainly supplied abundant material for
the examination of this vital question.
He might well reply that in a study of
this kind he is concerned with descrip-
tion, not with evaluation; but the
terms of evaluation are unavoidable,
and what is needed is a systematic dis-
cussion of the assumptions behind his
contrast between “threadbare cliches”
and “colorful language.”
In this same section, “Our Idiom
in Literature,” Mr. Baker touches
upon the third issue, which I find of
particular interest. In a brief para-
graph (too brief) he brings together
“the Australian sense of humor” and
the Australian language. By implication
he is attributing to both humor and
language certain qualities “irony,
terseness, and the conjunction of
seemingly incompatible images.” The
first two characteristics, irony and
terseness, have in this context them-
selves almost become cliches; but that
is no reason for dismissing them. I am
sure that there .is a link of the kind
hinted at here, and that it is well
worth investigating. Some of the best
modern Australian poetry has these
qualities in common; to say this is
not to submerge the individuality of
poems and poets in an easy generalisa-
tion, but to point to an accent as dis-
tinct from the English accent as is that
of the spoken language.
On this point the concluding chap-
ter, “The Australian Accent,” throws
unexpected light. In his earlier book
Mr. Baker had described three types
of Australian speech, slovenly, im-
proved slovenly, and cultivated. To
the last class he now adds a refine-
ment. Cultivated English is spoken,,
he asserts, by those Australians who
“do not resent being Australians,” and
also by those who try to pass them-
selves off as English. For this latter
kind of speech Dal Stivens has coined
the phrase “P. and O, English.” What:
Mr. Baker says here about the Aus-
tralian accent might surely be taken
further. For if his slovenly speakers,
fail irt articulateness and intelligibility,
his “P. and O.” speakers fare little
better by uttering a refined and
featureless jargon. At neither extreme-
is there any nourishment for literature.
I do not offer this comment as a
criticism of Mr. Baker’s work, but
as an indication of the areas of specu-
lation it opens up for the adventurous.


Film Critics in Conflict
WRITING IN
THE SIXTIES
By PETER COWIE
ART critics can comfort themselves
for having a tradition that they
can ape or revile at will, in the
persons of Pater, Ruskin, and latterly
Berenson; similarly, literary critics can
look for their antecedents in Sainte-
Beuve, Saintsbury, or Bradley. But the
family tree of film criticism can be
traced back barely beyond James Agee,
unless one counts the pedestrian his-
toriography of Paul Rotha or the
occasionally shrewd observations of
John Grierson in the ’3os. Agee, an
American who died in 1955, displayed
a passionate enthusiasm for the movies;
he judged each film on its own merits,
and one can only wonder how he would
have treated the work of directors like
Godard, Antonioni, and Fellini.
The origins of contemporary film
criticism, however, are
rooted in France.
Andre Bazin, whose
four - volume study
“Qu’est-ce qu e le
Cinema” is a standard
textbook, pioneered
through his writing in
“La Revue du Cinema”
(known after 1950 as
“Cahiers du Cinema”),
a number of principles
that would be espoused
later by “Movie” and
“Sight and Sound.”
The most important of
these is that a film is
governed by its mise-
en-scene, by its “or-
ganisation of time and
space” (Jacques
Doniol-Valcroze). This
proved so tempting an
opinion that Robin
Wood was to write in
“Definition” in 1961
that “an analysis of
mise-en-scene is the
only valid way of assessing a film’s
significance in relation to life, the
moral and spiritual values it embodies.”
The other principle, which Bazin
himself was rather less seduced by than
his colleagues, is the “politique des
auteurs.” Quite simply, this means that
a director’s films must be assessed not
singly but as a whole; and that conse-
quently once a director has been
accorded the mantle of greatness he
can do no wrong. It is inconceivable
to the “Cahiers” group and their dis-
ciples throughout the world that “Torn
Curtain” could be a straightforward
failure: it must somehow fit into
Hitchcock’s overall view of life, or, if
one takes the Robin Wood line, the
Peter Cowie is managing -director of
the Tantivy Press, the leading English
publisher of film books, and author of
“The Cinema of Orson Welles.”
studio back-projection must evince
moral significance.
Meanwhile, in England, Lindsay
Anderson was leading the “commit-
ment” crusade, exhorting fellow critics
to permeate their work with their
political ideals (Left Wing, of course).
But disillusionment and amnesia set in
when Mr. Anderson’s colleagues began
to make names themselves in the in-
dustry and to be wooed away from
their soapboxes. Directors became
interested in the “private” film rather
than the didactic “message” film. Per-
sonal experience was suddenly com-
municated with a new force in the
cinema. “Commitment” also faded
when, in the early ’6os, a group of
young critics began discovering all over
again how the cinema worked
Ingmar Bergman
“Hitchcock The Mechanics of Sus-
pense” (my italics) was the revealing
title of an article by lan Cameron in
“Movie.”
How a film was made, rather than
why it was made, became the corner-
stone of criticism. Magazines like
“Definition” and “Motion” sprang up
and almost as quickly subsided in the
face of economic difficulties. “Films
and Filming” reached its high water
mark during 1963, but since then has
declined steadily until the proof-
reading is as bad as the contributors’
syntax, and the layout is sadly un-
professional. It remains the biggest-
selling British film magazine, with an
alleged circulation of 40,000 a month.
But at least “Films and Filming”
stands no nonsense where directors like
Godard and Hitchcock are concerned.
Its editor, Peter Baker, writes in a
forthright style that compensates for
many of the magazine’s failings,
“Sight and Sound,” creaking with
official weight, is, with a circulation
°f 22,000 a quarter, all too influential
an d consequently eager to swallow a
new fashion almost before it has been
formed. (The editor, Penelope Hous-
t°n > is on record as saying that it’s
partly magazines our own which
help to create fashions. ) Its contri-
butors are as guilty as “Cahiers” in
their adherence to the auteur theory.
A Bergman picture can never be rated
so highly as a Bunuel; Orson Welles
is sneered at.
English film criticism has become a
horribly inbred business everyone
clinging to one another's postulates and
gradually enmeshing himself in urbane
opinions that often
break vital syntactical
rules and are designed
to drain the pleasure
from film-going. “Sight
and Sound,” one feels,
was waiting all along
for Antonioni to
justify its naive
assumption that a film
should be a novel. As
a result one finds the
American cinema of
the ’thirties sadly neg-
lected in the pages of
the world’s most
august film magazine.
When, indeed, is some-
one going to be
courageous enough to
say that Lee Games
and George Folsey
were better camera-
man than Raoul Cou-
tard?
There is also some-
thing perversely ob-
scure about the “Sight
and Sound” approach; typified, per-
haps, in the titles of articles devoted
to Antonioni (“Shape Around a Black
Point”) and Frankenheimer (“Black
Queen Takes Two”). The magazine’s
admiration for Godard’s films has
spawned some of the most shallow and
pretentious criticism of recent years.
(Although in fairness one should point
out that Godard’s own writings in
“Cahiers” are as confused and lazily
constructed as his films.)
Most staggering of all has been the
complete defeat of “Sight and Sound”
at the hands of the “Movie” team.
Features on Anthony Mann, Losey,
Hitchcock and a generally patronising
deference toward Hawks and Nicholas
Ray have characterised this change of
opinion. “Movie” itself has ceased
publication—although its chief architect,
lan Cameron, insists perennially that
another issue is due.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Capital Prospects
SCEPTICS may well think that our fresh, inexperienced
Federal Treasurer, Mr. William McMahon, has fallen
for the polite pleasantries of international finance.
At a Press conference for financial journalists in Can-
berra last week, Treasurer McMahon threw hopeful new
light on our foreign capital prospects. On every score he’s
more optimistic than before his North American journey.
But he does seem to have a number of significant concrete
reassurances, some of which are not available for publica-
tion. It can be said, however, that there is a feeling that
private capital inflow into Australia will not be greatly
hindered by the restrictive measures being taken by the
British and American Governments. Of the British measures
it was said that they are “not expected to bite deeply,” and
of the American, that reassurances had been received that
there, would “not be any great impediments.” And Mr.
Maxwell Newton (the former newspaper editor who used
to write the late Dr. Evatt’s more sensible economic speeches,
and now operates a Canberra information service), who
travelled with Mr. McMahon as a semi-official adviser, re-
ported that “Big British concerns are going to be able to
get pretty well as much money as they need out to Aus-
tralia one way or another.” This will apparently mean a
change in policy, as so far they have found it fairly diffi-
cult with Schweppes (which seems a fairly big operation, for
example) having to sell other Australian assets to take up
its entitlements to its local subsidiary’s new share issue, and
with the U.K. Treasury taking a tough line, in public, at
least, on this sort of thing.
There is also far more hope of raising public loans over-
seas. Back at the time of August’s Budget, the Government
thought that this would not be possible. Interest rates in
London are as high as 8.5 percent, so this market remains
completely out of the question. But New York rates are
lower, at around 7 percent. Of course, this is still too
high for the Government, but there are two reasons why this
may not prove prohibitive. First, the U.S. Government is
gradually shifting the burden of its measures for restraining
the domestic economy from the monetary to the budgetary
area. Taxation is replacing financial restriction as the main
means by which spending is being held in check. This
will mean lower interest rates, possibly down 1.0 or 1.5 per-
cent Second, there is some strong speculation that the
U.S. Government may be considering giving us exemption
from the interest equalisation tax. If both these two possi-
bilities were to be realised, there would be no reason why
a quite considerable amount of money—say sloom. —might
not be raised at close to normal rates of interest.
Adding these things up, the prospects for the balance of
payments —already brightened by the soaking rains of the
past two months—look more cheerful now than at any time
since the bumper year of 1963.
More Drastic U.S. Controls?
NO matter how cheerful Mr. McMahon may be about
the likely inflow of U.S. dollars to Australia, the
“Economist” reports that there is a growing view in
the U.S. that more drastic controls on direct investment
abroad are being considered. This has developed from hints
dropped by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Fowler,
to the world’s bankers in Washington a fortnight ago, and
MEN AND MATTERS
MR. ROBERT HELPMANN, who
a month ago joined the board of
Metropolitan Wholesale Meat
Co. to float soon in Adelaide
doesn’t think it at all strange for him
to be taking this particular role. Ad-
mittedly the theatre has been his life,
but at 57 he confesses that he’s always
been involved in its business as well as
artistic aspect. “The two can’t be
divided. You’ve got to get the audi-
ences in or know the reason why. The
principles are the same in any business;
only the details differ.”
A company well diversified in the
meat trade from buying livestock to
making smallgoods, Metropolitan Meat,
as it is known colloquially, was started
in a small way by his father, J. M.
Helpmann, in 1926, when a stock and
land agent in Mount Gambier. One of
his partners was the late Sir Sidney
Kidman (“the Cattle King”), whose
66-year-old son Walter is on the present
board and also on that of Bennett
Fisher Ltd. and a round score of pas-
toral companies. The other was Mr.
F. G. Ryan, the present chairman.
Helpmann’s father died shortly after-
wards, but the family has always re-
tained a big interest in the business.
Now that he’ll be in Australia for half
of every year, it seemed right to
him, with his only
brother in Canada
and his mother and
sister in Adelaide,
to help look after
it.
Helpmann is not
shy of blood, and
is obviously very
interested in all
aspects of Metro-
politan Meat. At
this stage he says
he’s rather “the
listening boy” at the monthly board
meetings, and has a lot to learn —that
is, in between, say, rehearsing with the
Australian Ballet and performing at
Covent Garden this Christmas. As
Australian company directors go, Help-
mann is among the fittest, though the
longish hair is greying and the facial
lines heavy.
WHEN mining leaders looked
among themselves for a human
catalyst to bring the industry’s
diffused company elements together into
a representative national body, Mr.
Clarence A. Byrne, president of the
Queensland Chamber of Mines (since
1961) with his long record of smoothing
things out for CRA with various min-
R. Helpmann
S. Kidman
C. A. Byrne
isters of mines in that State, proved
an admirable choice.
Since he left Brisbane Technical
College, 63-year-old Mr. Byrne has had
his finger in too many Queensland and
national minerals pies to mention them
all here. Before doing a six-year stint
in the Navy during World War
11, he’d already had long experi-
ence exploring and developing minerals
in central Queensland. He entered
CRA’s door (he is now executive
director) via Zinc Corporation. His
special concerns are now the Queens-
land oriented bauxite alumina and
minerals sands interests of the group,
and he’s also a director of Interstate
Oil, which, of course, has a stake in
Queensland through AA Oil and
Santos.


following the latest survey of American capital spending
abroad.
The survey shows that total spending on new plant and
equipment in foreign countries by American firms this year
is expected to be $9.2 billion, an extraordinary 20 percent
higher than in 1965, and that outlays in 1967 are also
expected to be just about as high. Petroleum companies are
spending, and are planning to spend, more abroad than at
any time since the record (post-Suez crisis) year of 1957,
and the booming demand for minerals is bringing heavy
investments by mining interests, especially in Australia.
The foreign spending of manufacturing companies, which
are now responsible for over 50 percent of total new invest-
ment overseas, accounts for nearly 23 percent of their pro-
posed capital expenditures this year, rather surprising now
that the return on such investment is no longer as high as
that on domestic outlays.
Little of this additional spending is to be financed by
funds coming directly from the United States. The annual
rate of outflow for direct investment abroad in the first
half of this year was only $2.7 billion, compared with
$3.1 billion in 1965, when allowance is made for special
transactions; such investment now comprises about 90 per-
cent of all private capital going overseas. Outflows to
Europe have held almost steady, although this is the centre
of the increased expenditure. This is proof of the efforts
which American companies have been making, at the
request of the Government, to find foreign sources of funds
in order to mitigate the impact on the balance of payments
of their operations abroad.
Unfortunately, however, they have not been able to
promise to help as much as they did last year, except where
their exports are concerned. And, unfortunately, the gain
in exports is being more than offset by increased imports.
On top of that comes the drain on foreign exchange of the
war in Vietnam. As a result little if any improvement in
the total deficit on the balance of payments is expected this
year. So it. is not surprising that Mr. Fowler’s hints have
given an ominous look to the future for U.S. capital spending
abroad.
Toward a Tariff Policy
AT last tariff policy is being thrown open for intelligent
public discussion. The latest Tariff Board report is
far from being a great advance toward clarity of
thought there is still an introduction which deals with
price and cost trends in Australia and overseas which is not
related in any way to the board’s discussion or policy, and
there is quite a lot of the usual ambiguity and illogic. But
for the first time it is starting to come to grips with the
important issues.
The minority members are bluntly and refreshingly
critical of past and present policy. They point out that
the question of whether an industry is “economic” or not
can only be answered by looking at it in relation to other
industries. Only some sort of general benchmark or uni-
form tariff policy can guide the flow of new investment
into economic industries, and save it from being wasted
in the creation of high cost industries.
Tariff protection has been granted to virtually all sig-
nificant firms which have asked for it, regardless of the
effect on costs in general of encouraging uneconomic indus-
tries. It is “hindering the attainment of a high rate of
economic growth.” The majority members seemed to accept
these quite damning comments on the indiscriminate policies
of the past, but they managed to reject the immediate appli-
cation of the benchmark policy by pointing to conceptual
and statistical difficulties. As they said, the Vernon report’s
chapters on the tariff were hopelessly confused and contra-
dictory and on this basis it is easy to avoid doing any-
thing new. But sense can be extracted from what the
Vernon committee was trying to say. Dr, Max Corden
has done this admirably in an Economic Record article.
And the point is that at present the board has no coherent
policy. A move toward a uniform tariff, though difficult,
would at least be the beginnings of a policy.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
FOr the economy: Rises in industrial costs pro-
ceeded last week with higher prices for aluminium to
follow recently increased copper prices; this general
cost inflation (which is proceeding apace despite slack
demand) is likely to receive another boost when the
margins judgment comes out next month . . . The
ACTU will apply for an interim increase of $1.50 in
the Federal basic wage.
Census figures released show a slowdown in the Aus-
tralian population growth rate, 1.9 percent over the
past five years, compared with 2.27 percent between
1954 and 1961. Australia’s population at June 30 was
11,544,691 . . . World liquidity problems and the
price of gold exercise minds in the Treasury. Mr.
McMahon called for an international subsidy to increase
world gold production.
For the markets: The end of the week saw
stronger support for industrials, and revival of interest
in oil prospectors, on Australian share markets.
Government bonds set a cracking pace on the London
market, and some of the attractions of gilt edged secur-
ities rubbed off on first rank fixed interest stocks . . .
Assurance from two Administration officials that wage
price controls will not be required because of the
Vietnam war revived investors’ confidence on Wall
Street.
For companies: Continuing a 23 year run of
profit advances, W. R. Carpenter reported profit of
$4.9m., up 4.6 percent on the prior year . . . News
of another big profit gain came from Mcllwraith Mc-
Eacharn, so ordinary and preference dividends moved
up from 9 to 9| percent . . . This should help major
shareholders Boral, whose first quarter result was com-
parable with the same period in 1965 . . . Controver-
sial brewer, colliery owner, and tanker operator (if
only part-time) R. W. Miller (Holdings) earned 21.9
percent on bonus-inflated capital although profit
dropped 14 percent to $1,975,000.
Latest chapter in the F. W. Williams serial is a
second amendment to Pioneer Concrete’s bid. The offer
is now, for every two F. W. Williams shares, two Pioneer
shares with deferred dividend rights, plus $2.10
cash, with the option to use the cash content to acquire
ACI shares at $2.59 . . . The cash element of the
Gollin bid for Harco has been increased. The new offer
is one Gollin 50c share and 20c cash for every two

Helping your staff to save money
helps you to keep them happy
National Savings Groups are popular with
employees . . . practical for employers. The
employee with savings behind him is a sounder
citizen and a better employee, self-reliant and
with confidence in the future. That is one of
the reasons why more and more employers each
year are co-operating in the formation of National
Savings Groups within their establishments. The
National Savings Scheme is sponsored by the
Commonwealth Treasury.
Find out more about National Savings Groups . . .
National Savings Groups are conducted in
factories, offices and shops throughout Australia
in conjunction with ALL savings banks.
Employees notify their pay office of the amount
they wish to save each pay day. These sums
are deducted from their pay and deposited
regularly on their behalf in the savings bank of
their choice.
On request, a trained National Savings Group

Ten Years of Savings Banks
IN a frank assessment of the first
decade of private savings banks in
Australia, the Bank of N.S.W.
(which led the entry in 1956 and has
since been followed at intervals by all
the other private trading banks) admits
freely that the competitiveness and
profitability of the parent banks have
benefited greatly by the move. It had
to, of course, because last year net
profits of the savings banks (all types)
was the equivalent of 80 percent of
the net profits of all Australian cheque
paying banks. And the private sav-
ings banks are considered to be more
profitable than the older ones.
In saying that, in competitiveness,
the private trading banks have had
the edge on the older savings banks,
the Wales points out, for instance, that
the established trading bank branches
provided ready made “nets” for sav-
ings deposits and that the new business
enabled them to take up some slack
in staff and accommodation capacity,
thus benefiting overheads. Another
advantage was that the new private
banks have probably achieved higher
average investment returns than their
older competitors because a bigger pro-
portion of their assets have been in-
vested at the better yields pertaining
since their existence.
Taking up a well worn theme, the
bank is by no means happy that the
bulk of additions to savings bank depos-
its in the past ten years have been
forced into Commonwealth Bonds and
public borrowings. It thinks the private
savings banks will have to seek a re-
vision of the regulations to provide in-
creased lending for housing. The
increase in demand for housing may be
expected to strain the capacity of the
lending institutions and perforce put
more onu s on the provision of hous-
ing finance by the savings banks. To-
gether, these now have about 25 per-
cent of their assets in housing loans. The
bank sees all this money circulating
freely in the private sector, “whereas
funds invested in Commonwealth bonds
may or may not re-emerge through
Government spending, dependent on
current Bank and Treasury
policies.”
On another aspect, the Wales con-
siders the needs of monetary policy
could possibly be satisfied with less
rigidity through freer movement of
savings bank interest rates and a relax-
ation of limits on investment in order
to improve the interest rate paid to their
depositors. In West Germany, for in-
stance, some savings banks provide
medium-term export credit. While tight
lending controls may be justified in
conditions of emergency, the Wales says
they are liable to become the plaything
of politics if their use is perpetuated,
and in any case, it appears contradic-
tory for the Government to stress the
need for stronger competition in some
areas while curbing it in banking.
Spring in the Marriage Market
SAP rises in stockbrokers, as in most
of us, at this time of the year when
new ’ greenery dresses the trees.
They case among old loves for exciting
market possibilities. One of them in
Melbourne sees hope in the company
marriage market, even finding national
virtue in “the need to integrate.”
Nostalgic for past takeovers by “locally
nationally minded” companies like
Peters, Myer, Repco, Coles, Wool-
worths, and Elders and more recently
Johns and Waygood and Perry, he ex-
claims “more strength to their bows.”
The national advantages aside, he
addresses his appeal for more take-
overs (far better for the market than
mergers) to shareholders’ who can
usually get an immediate increase in
the price of their shares. Just the
thing for springtime. One can also
look ahead to medium- and long-teim
pulls even if the market benefits may
not be all plain sailing.
Let him explain. “For the company
doing the takeover provided the field
is familiar and the price paid is not
excessive, and such items as stock and
, , , ’ ,i „ • i - 11( .
bad debt - audits well carried out —
medium- to long-term benefits should
eventuate. It is not unusual in the short
term for a period of reorganisation to
produce problems, and possibly a re-
duced earning rate. Also if the techni-
que of a share exchange rather than a
net cash purchase is employed, some
short-term share price weakening may
result due to profit-taking, and also the
greater availability of shares. How-
ever, long-term investors will continue
to ride out these short-term fluctuations
for the long-term advantages,
He has timed his suggestion fairly
well. There has already been a resur-
gence of takeover activity with last
week bringing bids for two Emu corn-
panies (one in wool and the other in
gravel) and a possible one (tipped by
“Jason” a fortnight ago) for Reinvest-
ment. And, of course, the continuing
story of F. W. Williams (the post where
its shares are traded is loosely called
Martin’s Corner by old soap opera
listeners) proceeds with Pioneer Con-
crete trying even harder,
Then there are the bids by Collin
for jq arco) by A & K Cement for
Gippsland, -by Boral for Bayview, by
Devon Credits for Cranvel, by three
rivals for Indooroopilly Toll, and the
two j-jjg re t a h offers, Ralli for Cox
an d \y a itons f or Marcus Clarks.

low . * ere could hardl y a better

chases, particularly by companies that

Some Export Satisfactions
By CROESUS
UNLIKE Mr. Holt when Treasurer
the previous year, Mr. McMahon
refrained from giving an esti-
mate of exports for the year in his
recent Budget speech. The only clue
he gave to the Government’s expecta-
tions was on minerals. He said that
on his information the value of mine
output as a whole would rise by about
12 percent to $670 million this year.
Allowing for some increase in local
consumption it might be inferred from
this that export receipts from minerals
would increase by 10 percent or more.
This would, of course, be open to
challenge, as would the estimate of
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics
for rural exports issued last week. Both
are vulnerable to the possibility of wide
fluctuations in world prices.
Estimating export income is not the
easiest of exercises, but the Bureau of
Agricultural Economics is pretty good
at it. Even if its shot for this year, in
reckoning rural exports will rise by
3 percent, would seem to depend on a
lot of “ifs” and “buts,” it might not
miss the target by all that much.
A s counted by the Bureau, last year
rural exports comprised about 71
percent of the total export income of
$2726 million, so assuming a similar
percentage of the total this year, this
segment will have a major influence
on the overall exports out-turn in the
current year. Of course, things could
go wrong with other exports, but, at
least, that doesn’t seem to have hap-
pened thus far. In the first three
months to end September total exports
were about 9 percent higher than in
the like period 1965-66.
In view of continued high world
prices of most of our commodities, rural
and minerals exports both have
been playing a strong part in this im-
provement, but in the absence of
monthly trade details since July it
is impossible to say the same about
manufactured products, whose steadily
rising contribution to the export total
has been outlined by Mr. C. P. Puzey,
the director of the Australian Industrial
Development Association, in his latest
report. Mr. Puzey is anxious lest this
contribution be overlooked with so
much talk about the glowing prospects
for minerals exports in the air.
Having taken out a few figures my-
self for exports over the past six years,
I’m convinced Mr. Puzey can rightly
extol the performance of manufactures
vis-a-vis that of minerals, at least over
this period when minerals exports rose
from 7.7 percent to 11.3 percent of the
exports total, while those of manu-
factures increased from 9.8 to 14.5 per-
cent of it. In monetary terms the in-
crease over the five years was $157.2
million for minerals and $203.9 million
for manufactures. It also is worth
noting in manufactures’ favor that the
figures for manufactures exclude those
processed from primary products. The
latter contributed 22.8 percent of ex-
ports, bringing the total for manu-
factures up to 37.3 percent on that
basis.
It is encouraging that in the five
years since 1960-61 we do seem to
have been processing a higher per-
centage of primary products for the
export market. We find that while
exports of unprocessed primary pro-
ducts last year were 21 percent higher
than five years earlier, those of pro-
cessed primary products were up by
27 percent. Even if not all that strong-
ly, the trend continued last year when
exports of unprocessed primary pro-
ducts fell a shade (from $1589 to
$1571 million), while those of pro-
cessed rose from $5BB to $597 million.
As one would expect, the latter im-
provement was due mainly to a big
increase (actually from $117.3 to
$149.9) in processed mine and quarry
products and it is in minerals where
the scope for doing more local work
on raw materials looks brightest and
the most profitable.
Of course, as AIDA admits, no in-
dividual manufactured product has as
big an impact on earnings as the major
bulk primary products. Even including
processed primary products exports of
manufactures still lag well behind ex-
ports of unprocessed primary products.
But a number of manufactures are
making major contributions, the range
of manufactures exported is very wide
and is being extended constantly to a
wide selection of markets.
For instance, exports of motor
vehicles and parts have more than
doubled in value in the past six years
to s47m complete motor vehicles
rising from s7m to sl7m and of parts,
accessories, etc., from sl2m to s3om.
And there are also some pretty big
sellers among engineering products,
machinery and equipment (which com-
prise a substantial part of manufactured
exports) including communications
equipment valued last year at $7.6m,
engines s6.lm, agricultural equipment
s6m and tractors including parts s4.lm.
Similar expansion has occurred in ex-
ports of chemicals, which notched up
$43 million last year, the largest item
in this being $lO million for drugs and
medical preparations.
AIDA also points with satisfaction
to the contribution being made to ex-
ports by some of the manufacturing
industries that have sprouted up or have
been greatly expanded since the war. An
outstanding example of the newer in-
dustries is the manufacture of piece-
goods and yarns of man-made fibres
which exported $8.7 million worth last
year. Of somewhat older origin but
industries which have expanded greatly
in recent years, it instances plastics,
which exported $6.6 million, and pulp,
paper, and paper board $6.2 million
worth last year
(in both cases a
little down on the
previous record
year).
However, physi-
cal goods are not
the only contribu-
tion manufactur-
ing industry is
making to our
overseas earnings,
and in this con-
nection AIDA
C. Puzey
mentions that many Australian manu-
facturers have set up branches in the
“developing” countries overseas. It says
that, “not only are these companies
earning dividends for Australia, but they
are also helping to raise, the level of
industrial activity and employment, and
hence also standards of living in these
developing countries, which will become
an increasing market for Australian ex-
port products generally.”
One gets the impression that in view
of all these things, especially the fact
that exports of manufactures have
more than doubled in the past six years,
AIDA is a bit sore that manufacturing
industry isn’t getting more of the ex-
port limelight. As it says, the manu-
facturers’ achievement tends to be over-
looked “in the general preoccupation
with the price of wool and how many
millions of bushels of wheat Mainland
China will absorb for us.”
BUSINESS BOOKS
Australia
and the EEC
THE news from Britain’s external-
payments front is brighter than
for some time. The coming
winter is going to be very rough in the
domestic economy, but the chances are
if the balance of payments improve-
ment can be sustained that the massive
labor redeployment exercise now in
train will give the country a much
stronger platform for launching the
mooted spring into the European Com-
mon Market. So, although Britain is
not yet ready for Mr. Michael Stewart
to start on his promised European
journey, next year he could be packing
his bags.
Australia must therefore be prepared
sooner rather than later for another
battle in Brussels in defence of its trade
interests on both sides of the Channel.
For that reason, Monash University
lecturer Dr. H. G. Gelber has timed
it nicely in giving us a workmanlike
examination of our interventions (if
that is the right word) and their
general setting last time Britain was
negotiating with The Six (Australia,
Britain, and the EEC: 1961 to 1963:
Oxford University Press: $9.50).
We can agree with Gelber that, in
the round, Australia is fortunate to
have had the experience of its in-

volvement in the Brussels affair. A
number of complacent assumptions on
our side were upset and we learnt
many useful lessons, both in the manner
of approach to the negotiating parties
and in general expectation. Australia
was obliged to view its relationship
with Britain and the outside world
with a new and cold eye. It was not
exactly the parting of the ways, but
after Brussels things would never be
quite the same again. Because the
scope and complexity of the questions
at issue were new, the problems dif-
ferent, we just had to grow up on the
spot and, at home: keep our heads.
Gelber thinks we did both admirably.
At the same time, in his view, though
the Australian interests, genuinely at
risk, were important, they were not
really vital. Yes, but they seemed to be
at the time. As a matter of fact, they
would possibly be even less vital now,
such is the wider breadth of our export
markets. If Australians refused to
become unduly excited about the last
affair, disinterest might prevail among
the public next time. That could be
rather dangerous and, to strike a hard
bargain, we would be more than ever
dependent on the talking power of the
Minister of Trade and particular trade
interests.
A National Front for Mining
J, C. HORSFALL'S MELBOURNE
I DON’T believe for a moment that
the formation of the Australian
Mining Council, announced at the
24th level of the CRA building in
Collins Street one night last week,
means that Melbourne is going to sur-
render its hegemony in the mining
world to Canberra, where the head-
quarters of the new body will be.
The best I can say for the new move
is that it will give the Australian Mining
Industry a better international image,
in that any mining country worth its
salt seems to have a national body in
some shape or form to represent it
abroad. Perhaps it matters more than
I think it does to have one voice speak-
ing, as it were, officially for the indus-
try here. But we seem to lose something
when institutions like the Australian
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy have
to move over after having done their
job unobtrusively but efficiently as long
as one can remember.
The latter body has always been in
Melbourne. Doubtless it will be very
handy for the industry to have a secre-
tariat and a “strong” director (as Mr.
C. A. Byrne—see Men and Matters—
assured me the new council will have)
to get the messages from Collins and
Bourke Streets acrpss to the Govern-
ment and the Bureau of Mineral and
Resources and vice-versa. Yet most of
the serious parleying would, I should
think, continue to be done outside the
new official channels.
If there was any serious danger that
the big men that run the “Barrier”
companies, BHP or Western Mining,
say, would henceforth have to channel
their political representations through
such a body, I don’t think many of them
would have been in it. As it is, one
notices that the formation of the Aus-
tralian Mining Council has only been
accepted in principle. That could mean
different things to different people, de-
spite the great show of unanimity. It
has no teeth yet, but only a list of
objects, none of which seem to com-
mit anybody in the industry to danger-
ous courses.
An interesting possibility is that the
new secretariat will give the Bureau of
Mineral Resources a useful shake up,
but I wouldn’t count on it, however
badly this is needed. There’s always a
danger that the staff of these national
associations get into a dull routine, be-
come too pally with the civil servants
they are supposed keep astir to the
interests of their industries when
located in Canberra, far from the
dynamic personalities running the indus-
tries involved. Even when located in
capital cities, the directors and staff of
some of these industry organisations
have found time on their hands. Inertia
creeps over them. The possibility of this
happening in the wide open spaces of
Canberra looks pretty real.
Some of these associations have
turned into mere public relations
fronts to cloak the behind-the-scenes
machinations of their industries, and
have assumed an innocence which
doesn’t even deceive a mostly disin-
terested public. Alternatively, they have
sometimes been used to make the
announcements of, say, uniform price
increases by an industry, thus helping
to lift the approbrium of such moves
from the member companies. Again,
in some industries they have been use-
ful in the sometimes considerable task
of getting unanimity between member
companies on matters such as prices, an
aspect which Mr. Sneddon’s new Trade
Practices Commissioner will doubtless
be keeping his eye on. One should
realise, though, that had the Australian
Mining Council existed early in
August this year when Mt. Lyell
unilaterally announced its big increase
in its local price for copper, only to be
followed after an awkward delay by
Mt. Isa and others, much confusion
could have been saved by prior con-
sultation by the various companies
under the aegis of the council.
I’m not at all sure that the new
council will lend itself to this sort of
intra-industry liaison, though it might
possibly do so experimentally, at any
rate. The trouble with mining in this
context is that, although there are now
only a handful of old-type individual-
ists in it who like to and can afford
to go it alone, thrive on the inspired
independent move in this or that direc-
tion, in their place monolithic mining
groups have emerged which have simi-
lar; if corporative, hormones. With
these groups there is the added com-
plication that most of them cut across
national frontiers, and their decisions
are just as likely to be made in Lon-
don and New York as in Melbourne.


Money, Markets, Manipulations
MICHAEL BAUME'S SYDNEY
ARE the big woolbrokers pulling
their weight in helping the man
on the land over his drought-
induced financial problems? At first
glance it could appear from the evidence
of their highly liquid state at present,
and in particular from the recent annual
accounts of Elder Smith-Goldsbrough
Mort, that they are not. But first
impressions would be wrong.
Last week s balance sheet of Elders,
the ,g Adelaide-based group whose
profit was only slightly down despite
the drought in 1965-66, showed that it
actually had lent $6 million less to its
debtors than at June 30 last year, and
that it had put an extra $2O million of
its funds into Commonwealth securities,
lifting their total to $27 million.
If it was lending less it was borrow-
ing more: it had increased its trade
creditors by $5 million and borrowed
an extra $7.3 million from the bank.
But this shows the dangers of deal-
ing with balance sheets, for they only
show a company’s position at one par-
ticular point of time in the year
and the same conditions may not have
been operating at exactly the same
time in the previous year. For ex-
ample, the Adelaide wool sales this
year played a big role in temporarily
changing the look of Elders’ accounts,
It is also true that the company is
keeping a fair bit of cash up its sleeve
in readiness for the heavy demands
clients are likely to make on it when
restocking begins now that the drought
is over and spring is here,
In any event, to some extent the
increase in Commonwealth securities
held is a return to more normal levels
in earlier years, for last year the com-
pany did go through a period of very
tight liquidity when its holdings were
substantially reduced, and this is, in
reality, the major reason the latest
profit went down by $130,000 or so.
Income from investments (mainly
bonds) dropped $440,000 in 1965-66

Mr. Urquhart, the youngest-ever
chairman when he was appointed at 39
in 1960, went to Shore before doing
some accountancy and going into the
army, to get badly wounded at El
Alemain.
The tradition in the stock exchance
is that the vice-chairman takes over
when the chairman retires. And once
again there is a Shore man waiting in
the wings; Mr. John Cooper, a 52-year-
old ex-Burma Railway POW.
But King’s is not out of the run-
ning. David North, who rejoined the

is also on the executive as honorary
treasurer.
Fifty-six-year-old K. J. Polkinghorne
is one of the small band of brokers who
have always had strong links with com-
panies in the practical way of having
been employed in industry before he
joined the Exchange and he is still
a director of the company he used to
work for as company secretary, Union
Carbide Ltd.
WHAT a remarkable coincidence
that the Sydney broking firm of
A.B.S. White and Co. just hap-
pened to be transacting some of the
“small orders from our clients” in Aus-
tralian Consolidated Industries or
Pioneer Concrete or F. W. Williams
whenever finance journalists happened
to be looking at what was going on at
that Stock Exchange trading post.
Last Friday in letters to the daily
newspapers, A.B.S. White & Co., who
are in the Martin Corporation group,
replied to these inferences that their
market activities as brokers had been
primarily directed toward affecting the
market value of these shares and said:-
“We wish to state that we have had
some small orders from our clients to
deal in these stocks in the normal
course of our business and these orders
were not executed for the purpose of
establishing artificial market prices. We
have not acted as principals in any of
these stocks in this time.”
The coincidence seems to have con-
tinued, however, after the publication
of the White letter, and the follow-
ing day’s market report in one Sydney
morning newspaper said, “Pioneer’s
broker was among the sellers of ACT
while the broker associated with Mar-
tin Corporation once again operated in
buying that stock.”
Issues for the Elections
PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
THE Government is taking no
chances at the forthcoming elec-
. tions ; November 26 nears, it
is becoming increasingly apparent that
there will be an answer to almost every
Opposition campaigning point. On
foreign affairs, the Labor Party can
easily be shown as divided, vacillating,
and a danger to our alliances and
defence. LBJ’s visit will focus atten-
tio* l on as nothing else pos-
sibly could, and on this issue the Govern-
ment has a winner by itself, if
the opinion polls are any guide.
, Most people don’t like conscription,
just as most people don’t like taxes or
laws, but when it comes to the crunch
they will probably agree that all are
necessary evils, or prices to be paid for
the attainment of other objectives.
. As f lf the unreliability of the ALP
in defence matters is not enough, the
(government appears to be moving to
counter criticism in other areas by

The Battelle for Research
By JOHN G. HARDY
YOUNG and small, but with sophis-
ticated demands, Australia faces a
near impossible situation when it
comes to research which goes beyond the
elementary stages. At present, know-how
has either to be imported at heavy costs
to the balance of payments, apart from
the technical disadvantages, or to be
found here at disproportional expense
and time loss —or just left uncovered.
In a modest attempt by the Federal
Treasurer to contribute to the solution
of the Australian research problem, the
Government intends to provide “up to
$6 million a year for a scheme of
grants,” although it seems to mean an
expenditure of only $250,000 for the
current year. And while even the small-
est gesture deserves gratitude and pro-
vides a ray of hope (the scheme has still
to be finalised), this approach will
hardly supply a satisfactory answer.
West Germany, which in 1952 was
faced with a similar dilemma, has been
fortunate in finding a very much better
procedure by encouraging the Battelle
Memorial Foundation in Columbus,
Ohio, to establish a “branch” at Frank-
furt. The gains from this step are im-
possible to calculate in monetary terms
but are judged by even the most scep-
tical observers as immense. There is no
obvious reason why Australia could not
at least try to imitate this example.
’JHE founder of the “Battelle Insti-
tute” was Gordon Battelle whose
forebears reached America not long
after the Pilgrim Fathers. A legend
claims today that young Gordon found
his lack of scientific knowledge such a
hindrance that he decided to provide a
better chance for others. The story is
most probably apocryphal, but when he
died in 1923 without natural heirs at the
age of 40 after an appendectomy he left
his considerable fortune to “the ad-
vancement of science through the con-
duct and encouragement of scientific re-
search.”
The initial Institute was built in
Battelle’s home town Columbus, Ohio,
and some years later a second one for
the Pacific-Northwest region in Rich-
land in the State of Washington. The
Battelle Institute in Geneva was the
first establishment outside the United
States, to be followed in 1952 by an-
other one in Frankfurt (Main). No-
body professes today to know who first
thought of West Germany, but the
helpfulness of the Mayor in finding a
suitable site and the willingness of the
communal, State, and Federal authori-
ties to grant the institute freedom from
all taxes “helped a great deal.” Tax
exemption of this kind is not rare in
Germany if the “enterprise” is non-
profit making and works for the com-
mon weal, both fundamental rules for
every Battelle Institute.
All Institutes are engaged in “custom
research” or “contract research” in any
field for “sponsors,” half of which in
West Germany are public authorities
and the other half private enterprises.
Among the first are the Federal Rail-
ways, the Electricity Authority in Ham-
burg, and the West German Ministry
of Transport. Private sponsors include
Robert Bosch, Brown Boveri & Cie.,
General Foods GmbH, in Germany,
Grundig, the steelworks of Krupp and
Kloeckner, Lurgi and Sears Roebuck
Overseas Inc. in Frankfurt, to quote just
a few names well known in Australia.
Studies have been undertaken for enter-
prises in Belgium, Greece, the Nether-
lands, Switzerland, Italy, Norway,
Portugal, Sweden and for IGI, Laporte,
Hoover, Napier, the Staffordshire Pot-
teries and others in Great Britain.
Before accepting an “order” the In-
stitute investigates the feasibility and
whether the work will conflict with re-

search for other sponsors. Technical
collaborations with other Battelle lab-
oratories will be provided only upon the
express request of the sponsor. The
charges cover salaries and wages,
material, use of machinery, travel ex-
penses, and freight charges plus a fixed
interest percentage on the working-
capital. In most cases personnel charges
amount to two-thirds of the total cost.
A firm price and time estimate is rend-
ered which cannot be exceeded without
the approval of the sponsor.
Security regulations are drastic.
Nobody is admitted to the laboratories
and workshops without a big “Visitor”
tag. All strangers must be accompanied
by a staff member who wears a name
tag with his or her photograph.
Enquiries received by Battelle are
treated as confidential prior to conclu-
sion of a contract. While research is
in progress, close contact is maintained
with the firms which receive regular
progress reports and, of course, a final
report. The publication of research
findings is subject to permission by
the sponsor. All results become the
exclusive property of the sponsor but
if solutions are patentable the inventor
is entitled to a fee according to German
law.
<r pHE integrity of the Battelle Institute
has become a household word. No
advertising or promotion is carried out.
An invitation to join a Battelle Insti-
tute is regarded by scientists as an
accolade. In Germany the number of
original staff members rose from 18
in 1952 to 900 in 1966, the vast
majority of them German nationals.
Turnover was a modest 20,000 D-Mark
($A3,600) in the first year, but ex-
ceeded 25 mill. D-Mark ($A2.3 mill.)
in 1965. If these sums appear small
it must be remembered that they are
a pure service charge and constitute
a net production value.
The Battelle Institute in Frankfurt
started with an establishment loan from
the Columbus Institute of SU.S. 2 mill.
The development has been financed out
of the interest charges. Today there
are ten departments with a great deal
of autonomy and their own budgets,
covering Applied Mathematics, Indus-
trial and Regional Planning for Devel-
oping Countries, Economic and Market
Research, Physics, Chemistry, Electri-
cal Engineering and Electronics,
Biology, Mechanical Engineering,
Metallurgy, and Ceramics.
There are in Germany, as in Aus-
tralia, a few bodies which could be
classified as “competition” for very
select problems, but by and large the
Battelle Institute has filled a gap which
exists in practically every country. If
the Columbus Institute could be in-
duced to extend their activities to Aus-
tralia in Australia, a lot of our prob-
lems would be solved in one fell swoop.
There would be no currency out-
flow, because the Institute does not
make profits; one hole less in the brain
drain, which actually might become a
brain magnet; by not confining studies
to Australia, the Australian Battelle
Institute could forge another link with
Asia and even Africa to name just
a few of the side-advantages.
Somebody, of course, will have to
make an approach, and it should not
be the Government. The Australian
Industrial Research Group might be a
good choice, or the Australian Indus-
tries Development Association, or even
a group of well-informed individuals.
Preliminary enquiries could be directed
to Sir Wolfe Fisher, New Zealand’s
self-made man who is today the Stell
Corporation’s chairman and who knows
quite a bit about Battelle. If Mr. Fair-
hall is right in claiming that Australia
is spending SAIOO million a year in
overseas royalties, every avenue is worth
trying and Battelle should decidedly
not be the last.
TAKE YOUR PARTNERS FOR...
The W.A. Iron Ore Polka
BHP and Sentinel, the two late starters in Western Australia’s iron ore projects,
are taking critical roles in the new stage of negotiations now developing.
There have been three phases in the
iron ore operation (see table), the third,
due to reach finality in October and
November. But the Mt. Whaleback and
Robe River schemes of phase three are
unlikely to be carried through in their
present form, and a fourth marshalling
of forces is, in fact, already beginning.
In this, BHP’s unusual relationships
with the other groups—and its special
place within the Australian economy
and the hearts and lobbies of Federal
and State parliaments must influence
the pattern of events.
The groups already exporting Pilbara
ore—Goldsworthy and, more particu-
larly, Hamersley—must be viewed by
BHP as potential destroyers of its
monopoly position with steel. Hamers-
ley, and the Japanese steelmakers buy-
ing the ore, saw BHP’s influence in
Federal Government interference with
the price mechanism in April; it was
said then that the Government feared
cheap Australian ore rebounding against
the economy as cheap steel. Yet the
ant,-BHP group point out that, follow-
ing this, BHP mined the consortium
which has contracted to sell to the
Japanese at the State’s lowest price.
But this is not the only consideration
for BHP, who have offered their Why-
alla pellets, starting production in two
years, to the Japanese. Their most likely
competitors are Cliffs, who were their
original partners in the Cape Preston-
Robe River development which was
shelved. The Cliffs people say they had
not fully discounted this first scheme
when their agreement ran out at the
end of March and they became in-
volved in the grand consortium plan
to produce lump ore and pellets at
wholesale.
And they are put out by the implica-
tion that they defaulted from this
scheme. The reason was simply that
pelletising was eliminated from the
scheme, and pelletising is their main
business. This poor image that has been
created could hurt them in current
dealings: during the visit of Cleveland
Cliffs vice-president Bill Dohnal last
week, Development Minister Court did
his best to dispel this by the pointed
comment that Dohnal had shown a
much more optimistic approach than
had come from other channels,

gritty and painful. On the Whaleback-
p 0 rt Hedland scheme, costs have
doubled from an estimated $l2O million
to the present $240 million. Before
Cliffs returned to review their original
Robe River proposal, the consortium
had told the Japanese that throughput
would need to be increased by 2 million
tons a year. With solar salt and other
exports, as well as Goldsworthy’s iron
ore, this would have entailed 500 ships
a year being turned around in a port of
limited capacity.
Yet, up the coast at Eighty Mile
Beach, the world’s biggest shipowner,
Ludwig, is surveying an open-sea port
that would accommodate super-
carriers two and even three times the
size of the 100,000-tonners planned
eventually for Port Hedland. The best
offer made to Japanese demands for
a more elastic scheme was for a 68,000-
tonner and a 100,000-tonner to be
accommodated at the one time. Lud-
wig’s bulk carrying concern has ordered
six 276,000-ton oil tankers from Japan.
BHP would be anxious that a self-
contained scheme, with or without
Port Hedland, should get under way—-
for this would give them a big say in
the price Australian ore was being sold
to the Japanese. But if this proves
uneconomic, could a consortium involv-
ing BHP and Sentinel be compatible?
'J'HIS proposition may yet be tested.
It must be painful to recall that
Stan Hilditch and Charles Warman,
who originally pegged the huge Mt.
Whaleback deposit, once offered it to
BHP.
Across to the south-west along the
Robe River, the Cliffs’ deposit extends
within 30 miles of the Hamersley line,
which is already operating. To link
up would help both camps Cliffs,
now without BHP backing on their
first Cape Preston scheme; Hamersley,
to help pay for the line and port.
Certainly it could accommodate both
sets of output with its capacity for
moving 40 million tons a year. Yet,
because it would strengthen both Cliffs’
pellet-making economics and Hamers-
ley’s financial readiness to go into steel,
it would not be to BHP’s liking. And
if both the present Whaleback scheme
and a proposal to join Ludwig failed,
forcing BHP out of the consortium,
would BHP then go across and try to
join potential rivals Cliffs and Ham-
ersley?
As things stand, the next few weeks
are likely to see Sentinel move into
the area in earnest, Cliffs and Hamers-
ley come to some agreement on sharing
the haulage line and the port of Dam-
pier (Cliffs have been given until Nov-
ember 14 to come up with an accept-
able proposition), and the Whaleback
project either consolidate or bog down;
and failure would mean either an alter-
native port to Port Hedland possibly
even an atomically blasted port - or
an arrangement with Sentinel. Purely
commercial considerations have long
since gone overboard in the Pilbara,
and compromise by both governments
and companies have become inevitable.

Shopping for Retailers
By JASON
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
ON the face of it, the depressed
retail stocks probably provide
some of the best buying oppor-
tunities for the long term in this in-
dustry than for many years, particu-
larly if there is to be the lift in con-
sumer spending that the Government
has been forecasting for the last six
months or so.
But how good are the major retail
groups as investments? An examin-
ation of their balance sheets (except for
Myers, which had not come out by
the weekend) indicates, that although
they all should benefit in varying
degrees from the end of the drought,
from the absence of decimal conversion
costs, and from the evidence of a slow-
down in the recent hectic pace of new
store construction, particularly in the
suburbs, there are major differences in
the outlook for each. There will be a
note on Myers after its accounts are
published.
THE market has not liked the look of
Waltons shares since the an-
nouncement of the year’s result
and annual report, and the takeover
bid for Marcus Clark. The shares
have fallen from over the $1.20 mark
when its Citibank link was announced
in July to only 91 cents (with the final
dividend accounting for 6.25 cents of
this).
Unless there is an increase in earn-
ings this year, the current 12| percent
dividend which provides the handsome
yield of 6.9 percent now obtainable
from this stock may be only barely
covered in 1966-67.
This emerges from the fact that
last year’s group profits of $2,762,818
included a dividend of $700,000 from
the Credit Corporation (which was
all but $2692 of its profit). This year,
following its 50 percent sale to Citibank,
Waltons will receive only half of what-
ever dividend is paid, suggesting a drop
in income from this source of at least
$350,000.
Such a reduction would have left
last year’s group profits at only $2.4
million to cover a dividend commit-
ment this year of more than $2.1 mil-
lion, following the $3 million note con-
version.
The question is whether Waltons
can increase profits from other activities
to offset this loss. There seems a real
prospect that they may be able to, as
there should be some return on the ex-
penditure of the S3J million received
from Citibank, despite the fact that
its own profits have been stagnant for
the past four years in the face of sub-
stantial physical expansion.
The acquisition of the Marcus Clark
group, with its $2.4 million in accumu-
lated losses last January, should bring
substantial relief from taxation which
cost Waltons $1.2 million last year,
and so give profits a boost, unless the
incorporation of Marcus Clark into
the accounts means including another
large loss.
The chairman will presumably have
more to say about the outlook at the
annual meeting (particularly in respect
of the tough competition in Melbourne),
but in the annual report he said that
trading conditions had improved mark-
edly in the first two trading months of
1966-67, with sales 17.8 percent (or 13.7
percent on a comparable number of
stores basis) higher than in the previous
year. i
One sign of strengthening in the
balance sheet was that despite the de-
parture of $4B million of accounts
receivable from the books (leaving
them at a still substantial $2O million)
the company has increased its “con-
tingencies” reserve by $1 million to $2.5
million, which directors say is “consid-
ered adequate” to meet any unforeseen
losses in respect of accounts receivable.
However, investors do not get any clear
idea of exactly what this is to cover, as
there is a “continuing arrangement,” un-
specified as to size, for Waltons to repur-
chase accounts receivable -from FNCB-
Waltons Corporation Ltd. The market
appears uneasy about the exact con-
sequences of that arrangement on pos-
sible bad debt figures in the group.
THE shortage of money and high
interest rates have certainly had
their impact on G. J. Coles,
whose accounts show a serious run-
down in liquidity and explain the
urgent need for the company’s $l5
million new share issue.
Coles’ massive expansion program,
which last year saw a record 39 new
stores added to the chain and the pur-
chase or lease of another 20 sites for
future development, involved the com-
pany in the expenditure of $16.2 mil-
lion on fixed assets. But in the previous
year the addition of 19 new stores and
the purchase of 54 new properties cost
the company only $lO-| million, indicat-
ing that the company is now having to
put up more of its own funds to finance
its continuing expansion.
The evidence of tightening liquidity
in its balance sheet is that current assets
of $3O million are exceeded by current
liabilities of $38.6 million, mainly be-
cause of a trebling of short-term bor-
rowings by the company to $lO million.
This liquidity situation would be
greatly assisted if the company were
to succeed in its claim for a taxation
reduction (from the $3.9 million pro-
vided by the parent company) arising
out of the surrender of inter-company
property leases in June before the ex-
piration of tax concessions on inter-
company amortisation following recent
changes in the tax law.
This tax question will presumably
also have some impact on David Jones,
whose recent accounts show that im-
provements worth $3.5 million had
been made on land leased to the parent-
by a subsidiary.
To improve its cash shortage, the
company is still trying to negotiate
further sale and lease-back arrange-
ments on its $82.8 million worth of.
properties.
There is no doubt about the fact,
as Sir Edgar Coles complained earlier
this year, that 1965-66 was a difficult
trading year. A sales rise of $2l million
brought a pre-tax profit rise of only
$21,538, and earning rate eased down
with the fall in the profit-sales ratio.
There is a danger that both Wool-
worths and Coles may both be ex-
panding too fast for their market. But
it seems that the greatest part of this
expansion is now over; $l6 million of
the $2O million expansion scheme an-
nounced in 1965 was spent on
properties and buildings during
1965-66. And the capital commitments
in the books are now down to $6.2
million against $9.4 million last year.
The current one-for-five rights issue,
which provides very cheap entry to
Coles, should also prove a good time
to buy, as there are prospects that a
slowing down in the rate of expansion
should bring , with it some better-
looking profits in the future.
THE market has not responded to
the recent Grace Bros. 5.2 percent
pre-tax profit rise, because it is
still far from certain how successful
Roselands is going to be now it has
two competitors at Bankstown Square
(with DJ’s) and at Burwood (with
Myers-Farmers). So far Roselands
appears to have done well enough, with
directors saying the group’s increased
trading and profit was partly due to


Roselands, where the initial survey
indications of a sales potential of $20
million a year have been proportion-
ately exceeded for the 8J months it
operated in 1965-66.
This survey, on which the decision
to build Roselands was based, had
taken into account the likely opening
of Bankstown, but it did not include
consideration of the Burwood centre,
which looks a more impressive develop-
ment.
The $144,668 pre-tax profit rise for
Grace Bros, was despite a $| million
write-off on Roselands development
and “substantial” costs of decimal
conversion. However, earning rate on
average capital employed fell slightly
from 22.2 percent to 21.4 percent,
despite the company’s natural desire
to show a small rise in its profit
announcement by reducing the tax
charge a little from credits in previous
years.
But the significance of the Grace
Bros, profit is that it came in the main
from the company’s other suburban
operations, established in a period of
relatively cheaper development costs,
and from the continued growth of the
removals and storage operation. With
no country stores, drought had little
impact. These suburban stores did well
enough in a bgjd year for retailing;
given a reasonable rise in consumer
spending they should do even better.
And it is probably no coincidence
that the John Martin group in Adelaide,
with which Grace Bros, has some
associations and which has closely fol-
lowed its pattern of suburban develop-
ment, has also put out an improved
result against the retail trend.
THE David Jones result showed
quite clearly where the tougher
times for retailers have bitten
relatively deeply.
The group’s pre-tax profits fell by
almost 5 percent, about $400,000,
despite the probable addition of at
least $150,000 or so from the inclusion
of the Western Australian operations
of the old Foy and Gibson company
for the full year instead of only six
months (and the worst six months at
that) in the previous year.
In the past few years David Jones’
accounts have had a dreary look about
them, despite the significant develop-
ments that have gone on in recent
years and which ultimately will no
doubt have their impact on the com-
pany’s profits. But so far these do not
appear to have paid off overall; last
year’s three percent return on the W.A.
investment clearly shows room for im-
provement, for example.
This expansion, which has recently
brought in Bankstown and Wollongong
stores, and which, with widespread
modernisation in W.A. and Queens-
land, involved increasing the group’s
fixed assets by $4 million last year, is
still progressing, with a further $2.4
million committed to capital expendi-
ture and a regional shopping centre
on the way in Brisbane.
In the latest year group turnover,
unfortunately still kept secret despite
the open approach of most other major
retailers, fell slightly, but retail sales
showed an unstated (but presumably
small) increase. They should increase
. further this year, helped by the new
stores, but profit margins may still be
fairly thin.
David Jones’ stated reasons for the
poorer result in 1965-66 are the rise
in operating expenses, combined with
the adverse effects of the drought. But
the accounts reveal that total expenses
rose by only $460,000 during the year,
a marked reduction from the $2.3 mil-
lion increase in 1964-65, and were,
despite a fall of $150,000 in the
miscellaneous expenses, gathered to-
gether under the one item of “advertis-
ing, interest, land tax, and oil other
expenses, including provision for doubt-
ful debts, etc.” (but excluding salaries
and wages which rose by $700,000 and
which make up well over half the
total costs of running the group).
Stock is down slightly, and so are
debtors, which suggests either slower
business or else better stock control
coupled with tighter credit manage-
ment. The $480,000 fall in gross h.p.
debtors (which underlines DJs’ rela-
tively small stake in the unnerving
business of consumer credit) has come
at the same time as a rise of $170,000
in provision for “income yet to mature”
that resulted from a change to the
“rule of 78” method.
Directors say, in a note to the
accounts, that this has not materially
affected the year’s results, but it cer-
tainly did in W.A., where the drop
in pre-tax profit of $47,271 would not
have taken place, they say, had
this rule applied in the previous year.
So it looks as if the 1964-65 profit may
have been a little overstated.
Prospects for the current year look
a bit better now that the drought is
over, although it seems likely that com-
petitive trading conditions in the new
suburban shopping areas and the con-
tinued pressure on city stores will keep
things fairly quiet. It is still remarkable
that DJs’, with its quality image, has
not moved into the North Shore of
Sydney, which is now dominated by
Grace Bros., whose image has been
well and truly upgraded.
THE Chartist has noted further de-
velopments in stocks that were
dealt with in earlier issues of THE
BULLETIN. She reports: “AGG, which
was recommended on July 2, 1966, and
subsequently rose to the year’s high
point of $2.81, has recently fallen back
to the base level at $2.10. The present
trend could be considered neutral and,
although the technical risk would be
high, there would be no reason to sell
this stock until a decisive penetratioa
of the base support level.”
To some extent, the drop in AOG
seems related to its diminishing specu-
lative appeal rather than its mounting
investment attractions, as the delays,
in further news of the BHP-Esso off-
shore oilfield have affected companies
like AOG with interests in neighboring
leases.
The Chartist also comments about
Australian Paper Manufacturers, which
is at present involved in a disagree-
ment with its former pulp supplier,
Tasman Pulp, over Tasman’s plans to-
compete with APM’s packaging board
in the Australian market.
“APM, which was included in the
review of paper stocks on March 12,
1966, is now showing the same technical
weakness as Associated Pulp & Paper
Mills and is settling into a downward
trend which would indicate selling
action. Prices could move down to
approximately $1.30.”
The Chartist says:
WITH Bankstown Square and Burwood Westfield so much in the news,,
investors’ attention could be turning toward the possible effect on David
Jones Ltd. The long-term trend on the chart shows that this stock has been
in a slow major downward trend since 1960 and could be classed as somewhat
cyclical within the wide trend channel. Possibly the best performance has been
the 20 percent uptrend, which commenced late 1962 and took prices to a high
point of $2.35 before selling action was indicated by the break in trend in March,
1964.
The downtrend which followed took prices to $1.40 by the middle of 1965 and
it appeared for some time that a base could have been forming above that level.
However, the situation has deteriorated technically over recent months and is
now in an area which lacks support levels back to 1960, which could cause prices,
to fall at a much faster rate to a more pessimistic downside objective of approxi-
mately $l. Last sale price on 11/10/66—51.23.

favorite, Minster, the rubber-bonded
goat-hair carpetmaker, whose price has
tumbled from $5.68 to only $2.63, yield-
ing 7.6 percent. But it has not yet made
anything like its full impact on the
company that investors who have been
dumped on the goat-hair swings can
pick up on the tufted roundabout
Carpet Manufacturers Ltd., who make
carpets not only from wool but also
from Caprolan continuous filament
nylon.
Although it has upped the company’s
shares this year by 28 percent from a
below-par 92 cents to a still modest
$1.15 (yielding 7.8 percent on dividends
and 12.7 percent on conservatively
stated earnings) the market is still
cautious of Carpet Manufacturers. It
apparently considers the company is
yet to prove its recovery from the
1961 recession; even the latest 22 per-
cent profit rise leaves earnings still
below their 1960 peak.
But nervous investors should look
more closely at Carpet Manufacturers’
depreciation provisions.
Tax provided has therefoie looked
excessive in relation to declared profits,
but has failed to disguise the trend in
profitability on both capital and total
funds. Next year the company will have
to taper off its depreciation charge, if
only because it is running out of items
to depreciate, and profits can be ex-
pected to rise accordingly, as a pre-
lude to a more generous dividend policy.
(The three-year-old 8 percent rate was
improved to 9 percent this year.)
The company makes all-wool woven
Axminster carpets, but the tufted car-
pets made exclusively of synthetics now
represent about 30 percent of company
output. In the U.S., tufted carpets take
84 percent of the market, so the scope
for growth by Carpet Manufacturers is
very attractive.
Since 1954, Carpet Manufacturers
has had technical agreements with Bige-
low Sandford Carpet Co. Inc., and a
Carpet Manufacturers’ subsidiary, Lok-
tuft Carpet Manufacturers, uses Bige-
low’s trade name, Loktuft, for its
tufted carpets. Bigelow at one stage
had significant shareholdings in the
Australian parent company, but these
were later sold to Templecross of the
U.K. which now owns 43 percent of its
capital.
Earning rate has been steadily in-
creasing from an unspectacular 7.8 per-
cent in 1961-62 to 14.6 percent in the
latest year, when profit was $317,000
after tax of $333,000 and depreciation
of $404,000.
This 22 percent profit rise was in
a flat period which, for the building
industry and retailers, was also ex-
ceptionally slack. And profit before
tax and depreciation rose 38 percent,
so the significant feature of the
accounts is that the depreciation charge
has been extraordinarily high.
The group accounts show that plant
and equipment has been about two-
thirds written off. But, in fact, the
carpet side of the business has done
far better than this. Plant depreciation
of the parent Carpet Manufacturers
company (the carpet maker) rose from
$225,000 to $327,000 because of the
inclusion of an unusual sum of
$116,000 for plant “which may become
obsolete in the foreseeable future.” This
sounds like careful accounting, particu-
larly when the year’s charge of $327,000
is compared with the $552,000 de-
preciated balance of the parent’s plant
at 1966 balance date, and its original
cost of $2,674,465.
ir pHE company is adding new plant
for its tufted operations. Last year
$190,000 was spent, and group com-
mitments for capital expenditure have
risen from the insignificant level of
$87,000 at 1965 balance date to
$226,000 in 1966, mainly for planned
extensions to the warehouse at Five-
dock, and to tufted machinery.
Consolidated in Carpet Manufac-
turers’ Ltd. group accounts are those of
the 51-percent-owned subsidiary, Syd-
ney Woollen Mills Ltd. (The balance is
held by Textile Holdings Ltd. of the
John Vicars group.)
Sydney Woollen’s profit rose in the
latest year to June from $84,128 to
$136,815, an exceptionally high level
of profitability, but capable of repeti-
tion, according to Carpet Manufac-
turers’ directors.
It produces yarn for woollen cloths,
but more than 50 percent of its busi-
ness is in supplying carpet yarns to
Carpet Manufacturers and other cus-
tomers.
Carpet Manufacturers’ parent stocks
of yarn rose over the year from
$1,169,000 to $1,381,950, but these are
exceeded by the stocks held by Sydney
Woollen, which include raw wool, and
which rose from $1,364,000 to
$1,547,000 before a constant $lOO,OOO
stock reserve.
Local production of woven, tufted,
and bonded carpets, and felt floor
coverings accounts for about 75 percent
of Australian sales. There is excess
capacity in the industry, but there is
little likelihood of an early reply on
the February tariff enquiry, or even
then a favorable one.
Usage of carpets generally should in-
crease with a growing appreciation of
the advantage, in commercial premises
and apartments to let, of soft floor
coverings over hard: reduction of noise
and heating costs, cheaper mainten-
ance (one-third to one-quarter that of
vinyl, rubber, or parquetry) and the
allowance of 20 percent depreciation
a year as a tax deduction. Under
present tax law, anything glued to the
floor becomes part of the building and
is not depreciable, which must make all
carpet makers happy.
Although volume production in the
first quarter of 1965-66 was running
15 percent above that of the previous
year (and 1964-65 sales were 15 per-
cent up on 1963-64), by the end of
1965-66 overall sales showed only a
small increase for the year, due to an
easing in new housing. But new lines
provided slightly better margins, and
the company did have the benefit of
lower wool prices. Wool is the vulner-
able area, but the company reports
that the current year has opened with
production, sales, and profits ahead of
the corresponding period of last year.

Rutile Holds Up Well
THE London market for rutile and
zircon from Australia’s east coast
deposits continues to hold up well.
The market is rather thin and pauses
in activity are common. Industrial slow-
downs do not appear to have had any
adverse affects on demand so far.
Rutile at present sells for about
£stg.44 to £45 a ton for standard
grade ore. This compares with £46
earlier this year, but is still substantially
above levels of three or four years ago.
Rutile’s two main markets—titanium
metal and pigment are growing
rapidly, and the price decline is largely
a technical market correction.
Zircon, a by-product of rutile output,
fetches £26 to £27 a ton. This repre-
sents a loss of about £4 a ton from the-
peak levels reached earlier this year.
But a fall was not unexpected follow-
ing strong gains last year. Substitute
materials were beginning to make in-
roads into some markets particularly
at or refractories. Similarly,
some P r^uce^ s had keen concerned at
high futile prices,
Another product of local beach sands
mining, Monazite, is also selling well
— at £stg.7o-75. a ton in London at
present. This mixture of rare earths
such as yttrium, cerium, europium, and
praseodymium faces an interesting
future, although possible alternative

forms for industrial, commer-
cial or private purposes. 929/66
sources of supply will be a factor in the
medium term. Many of its constituents
have become vital factors in modern
technology.
Europium and yttrium, for example,
are used in color television screens.
THE London wolfram market con-
tinues to climb steadily higher,
and speculation is rising on when
ore from U.S. fixed-price stockpile re-
leases will begin to be attracted to
export markets. Prices around 310/-
stg. a unit represent a 50/- gain in a few
months.
The next bi-annual Canton Trade
Fair opens this week, and reports of
Chinese offerings of ore will be an
important market factor in coming
months. On the whole, this part of
the picture is bullish, and it is becom-
ing more clearly so as implications
of China’s own internal problems and
her break with the Russian alliance
become clearer.
In particular sales of Chinese metal
to Eastern Europe now go via world
markets, in many cases, rather than
direct. This means the apparent level
of supply is misleadingly high. And
China’s commercial strategy is a not
insignificant reason for the reduction in
her rate of selling.
A figure of 275/- stg. a long ton
unit is mentioned as China’s aim,
though the accuracy of this talk is
very much open to doubt.
AN aluminium plant that began
operation in the U.S. recently will
provide an outlet for some of Aus-
tralia’s present and planned alumina
production. The SU.S. 150 million plant
is owned by Intalco, a partnership be-
tween Pechiney of France and Amax
(American Metal Climax) and Hownet
Corp. of the U.S.
Capacity by 1968 will be 228,000 tons,
making it one of the largest plants in the
world. Alumina will be supplied by
Pechiney and Amax.
Alcoa of Australia has a contract to
supply Amax with 200,000 tons of
alumina a year from its Western Aus-
tralian deposits. Pechiney is a partner
in the Gladstone alumina plant, and
has the right to 20 percent of output—
the company’s share will be 120,000 tons
a year, with increases likely if the group
goes ahead with expansion plans. The
U.S. plant, at planned full capacity,
would use well over 600,000 tons of
alumina a year.
THE OIL MARKET
Prospects for Interstate
WELL in advance of the drilling by
Shell Development to start early
next year in Frome-Broken
Hill’s offshore area in Western Vic-
toria, people up at 95 Collins Street are
finding it hard to contain their en-
thusiasm for the prospects for Inter-
state Oil, which, incidentally is the
only avenue for Australian public par-
ticipation in the venture. Some of this
enthusiasm has been rubbing off on
Interstate shares in the past week or
so, and on a similar line of expectation,
market interest has been rising in Wood-
side whose drilling in Bass Strait is
timed to start a month or so earlier
than Shell Development’s.
The hopefulness of Interstate pundits
is understandable, especially CRA’s,
because that group has more than fifty
percent (how much more is a very
moot point) of Interstate’s share capital.
In its turn, Interstate has a one-third
interest in Frome, whose three big part-
ners (the others are B.P. and Mobil)
have been waiting for goodness knows
how long for a pay-off on the heavy
stakes they’ve put up. The only catch
is that the price of Shell’s participation
in the Frome areas will be a reduction
(depending on how much Shell spends)
in their respective shares of any future
profits. If Shell spends $4 million, for
instance, it earns a 50 percent share,
so those of the others would be cut in
half.
If this dilutes the attraction of Inter-
state shares, we were reminded last
week of similar processes at work taking
the bloom off Woodside’s appeal. A
Supreme Court writ was taken out by
Harlowes Nominees Pty. Ltd., a sub-
stantial shareholder in Woodside,
asking that the allotment of nine mil-
lion Woodside shares to Burmah Oil
Aust. Ltd. a few months ago be declared
null and void. While the Woodside
board might argue that, to make up the
massive funds required to carry out
offshore drilling, it was necessary to
“water” the stake existing shareholders
had in the company, some shareholders
see it differently. The writ claims that
at the time of the allotment to Burmah,
Woodside didn’t have, nor has it now,
any need of funds which cannot be
satisfied by making calls on its uncalled
issued capital as issued prior to the
date of the issue to Burmah.

Gold Against the Trend
ON the heels of the International
Monetary Fund meeting gold
shares have shown a general mar-
ket weakness. This has resulted in
leading producers offering high tax-
free yields. Doubtless some specula-
tive buying resulting from sterling and
U.S. dollar weaknesses around May
and June this year has put a few shares
into unsteady hands.
Certainly the conclusions reached by
the IMF, excluding the recent large
gold buyers, that a “paper gold” inter-
national currency is warranted, rather
than a gold price rise, offer little of
the overdue incentive to gold producers.
But now Mr. McMahon has given a
new respectability to the notion of a
rise in the price for gold.
A constant drain on U.S. reserves
by increasing world trade, coupled with
the hint of an economic slowdown,
prompted Continental gold withdrawals
from the U.S. stockpile. In the past,
European countries had not been in
sufficiently strong dollar positions to
be able to act on their fears of a slow-
down in the U.S. economy. This is
evidence of a continuing faith in the
strength of gold as against a paper cur-
rency.
Gold producers have not been com-
pensated for upward movement in costs
as have the other metal producers.
Comparisons between the prices ruling
in 1936 and now, between gold and
other metals, establish this quite
clearly.

Since 1954 there has been a Gold
Mining Industry Assistance Act in
Australia. This act expired in 1962 and
was extended to 1965 and has been
further extended until June, 1970. The
purpose of the subsidy has been to
encourage local gold production, which
would otherwise be negligible due to
escalating mining costs and a fixed re-
turn. Large producers will, under a
recent amendment, be able to include
one half of exploratory costs for sub-
sidy purposes. In 1964 over $1.2 mil-
lion was paid out under this act.
But gold is not used only as a cur-
rency reserve. Industrial usage of gold
has grown at a compounded rate of
11| percent a year over the past five
years. Currently gold used industrially
accounts for 25 percent of total world
supplies including U.S.S.R. exports.
World production, stimulated by some
African expansion, has grown at the
compounded rate of 1\ percent over
the same period. A heavy fall in pro-
duction is expected to Commence after
1969, and by 1975 industrial usage
should account for 50 percent of world
production, assuming no return to the
exclusive use of gold as a monetary
standard.
In order of production the principal
Australian producers are; Gold Mines
of Kalgoorlie 155,0000 z., Lake View
and Star 150,0000 z., Central Norseman
96,0000 z., Great Boulder Gold Mines
86,0000 z., North Kalgurlie (1912)
77,0000 z.
Of these producers, Central Norse-
man is the only company hot receiving
the subsidy. For this reason, in the
event of a gold price rise, the profits
of Central Norseman will receive all
the benefits. For should the price of gold
be increased enough there is little doubt
that the Gold Mining Industry Assis-
tance Act will be repealed.
Gold recovery costs of this com-
pany have been increasing at a much
slower rate than the majority of other
producers. Over a period of ten years,
the cost of gold recovered has in-
creased by only 13 percent. Cost per
ton of -ore treated has advanced 23
percent over the same period, and this
is still well below most large world
producers. A break - even price of
around $2O per fine ounce has not
varied greatly over recent years.
At present the shares yield 9.5 per-
cent tax-free, but there are prospects
that lower earnings could bring a cut
in dividend. But even on the possible
yield basis of 7 percent the company
provides an adequate return.
Although stated reserves infer a life
of four years, this would seem to in-
clude only the developed part of the
mine as they have hot materially
altered for some years. The mine
appears to have many more years up
its sleeve than four, although there is
no guarantee about values after then.
Investment, rather than speculation,,
in low-cost gold producers should offer
the prospect of some capital gain, if
only when the next round of specula-,
tion oh the gold price comes, as welL
as high tax-free income. Of the Aus-
tralian producers, Central Norseman,
at its four-year low is the best two-
way bet.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Building for the future
HUNTER DOUGLAS seems to be the best prospect of the N.S.W.-based
companies associated with the building industry examined here in the past
six weeks.
During this period the market as a
whole has tended to move downwards,
so in the first instance the price of
the various companies’ shares when
the article concerning them was writ-
ten and today’s price will be com-
pared together with the high and low
prices for 1966 calendar year:
To-
Company 1966 Price Date day’s
High 'Low price
Blue Metal Industries 1.87 1.38 1 45 28/8 1.46
Brickworks 7.80 6.90 7.00 4/9 7.00
'Hunter Douglas 2.80 1.60 1.75 11/9 1.75
P.G.'H. Industries 1.60 1.05 1.12 17/9 1.13
Pioneer Concrete 1.62 1.26 1.29 25/9 1.33
Wormald Bros. 1.43 1.12 1.12 2/10 1.14
There has been,no worthwhile price
variation in any of these stocks as, even
in the case of Pioneer Concrete, where
special circumstances exist, the increase
in price is only about 3 percent.
Four of these six companies have
announced their 1965/66 results since
the articles about them were written
and in general terms all results were
“satisfactory” (to borrow a typical
preliminary statement word). The
results of Pioneer Concrete and Hunter
Douglas stand out from the other two
in terms of percentage increases. While
these better results could well be due
to the. companies having improved
their position at the expense of the
others, I think the different areas of
their operations had some considerable
bearing.
Brickworks only makes clay bricks
and pipes and its sphere of activities
is confined to New South Wales and
Queensland and then mainly in the
two capital cities. The demand for
the company’s products declined in
both areas and it would seem that
profit before tax and depreciation fell
by about 3 percent. This was a much
better result than I had expected in
the conclusion of my article, for in-
stead of the earning rate falling to 32
percent, it only fell to 35 percent, so
at current prices the shares are selling
at only 10 times earnings and the
dividend yield from the 15 percent
dividend rate is 4.3 percent.
Although bricks are used in com-
mercial and industrial building, the
main use is in dwelling construction.
For the immediate future, it is not
possible to see any remarkable im-
provement for the New South Wales
approvals for new brick houses and
for new flats fell about 2J percent in
the first two months of 1966/67.
Blue Metal Industries is engaged in
many more activities than Brickworks,
for not only does it extract aggregate
and produce pre-mixed concrete, but it
also makes bricks, does marble ter-
razzo work, and distributes timber.
Even if we assume that the other
activities are insignificant (and this
is hardly the case), the users of “blue
metal” and pre-mixed concrete are
spread far and wide. Building activity
is important (particularly non-
dwelling), but public works could well
account for a large part of the de-
mand for BMl’s products.
From the preliminary announce-
ment of the 1965/66 profit, it looks
as though earnings fell by about
$50,000, but until such time as some
indication is given regarding the
amount written off under the Mascot
contract during this last year it will
be difficult to calculate a figure for
earnings per share which is comparable
with the figure of 12.9 cents for
1964/65. In the interim, the amount
of $50,0*00 represents about 0.2 cents
per share, so I will assume that the
1965/66 earning rate was 12.7 cents
per share.
Pioneer Concrete Services has
turned in a very good result for 1965/66
as the figure given in a “preliminary”
preliminary announcement (for the
benefit of the Rowlands Quarries’
shareholders, who are being asked to
sell their shares to Pioneer Concrete
for cash), indicates a rise in net profit
after tax of 18 percent. However,
because of the increase in capital that
has occurred, it seems likely that the
earning rate will not increase so sub-
stantially. I have difficulty (because no
tax figure was given in the announce-
ment) in working out a figure for earn-
ings per share, but I think it is safe
to assume that the earning rate will not
be less than 12 cents per share and
could well be somewhat higher.
Pioneer suggests that the main in-
crease in profits came from its over-
seas interests, for conditions in Aus-
tralia were not very different from the
previous year. In the short term, in-
terest in Pioneer Concrete will be
centred on its double takeover bid
for F. W. Williams and Rowlands
Quarries. The acquisition of these two
companies would seem to involve the
issue of another 4,169,200 Pioneer Con-
crete shares, raising the number on issue
to 18.5 million.
Hunter Douglas seems to have
achieved the best result in terms of a
real improvement in profitability this
year, for although sales appear to have
been steady earnings improved by
about 10 percent, and at this stage it
looks as though per share earnings were
about 22 cents.
A comparison of the various com-
panies’ ordinary shares on the basis of
dividend yields and price/earnings
multiples shows:
Div. Earn
Per 'D5v. Price/ iPer
Company (Price $ Share Yield % Earn Share
Blue (Metal Indus. 1.46 7.5 5.1 12.7 11.5
Brickworks 7.00 30.0 4.3 70.0 10.0
Hunter Douglas 1.75 10.0 5.7 22.9 8.0
P.G.H. Indus. 1.13 8.0 7.1 8.6 13.2
Pioneer Concrete 1.33 6.25 4.8 12.0 11.1
Wormald Bros. 1.14 8.0 7.0 13.5 8.5
It is fairly clear from this table that
the market does not appraise share
prices on the basis of the adjustments
that I have made to earnings per share.
In particular, little account seems to
be taken of low (or high) tax pro-
visions. Yet there is considerable
similarity between the price/earnings
multiples of Blue Metal Industries and
Pioneer Concrete Services, where my
figures are based largely on after-tax
earnings.
Trends in per share earnings are also
important and on the basis that earn-
ings per share for 1961/62 equals 100,
we have:

On these figures, only one company
has maintained growth in per share
earnings into 1965/66 and paradoxically
that company’s shares have the lowest
price/earnings at the present time. On
the basis of the past record, it is
difficult to understand why Hunter
Douglas is not selling at higher prices.
While Wormald Bros, made a good
recovery, the marked drop in earnings
in 1962/63 and the reductions that have
occurred in dividends per share are dis-
concerting. Full recognition does not
seem to have been given to the dramatic
growth of Brickworks, but apart from
this, the shares of the other four com-
panies seem to be priced roughly on a
par. Hunter Douglas seems to be the
best prospect in view of the good
dividend yield well covered by earnings
which have been growing rapidly.
THE CHARTIST SAYS
None to
Recommend
THESE stocks should not be bought
at present, as the possibility of
further declines is indicated for
the short term, but they could well be
nearing the end of their downtrends.
Even after low points have been
achieved, a period of consolidation
would be necessary before any substan-
tial rise could occur. The building
materials index shows a gradual de-
cline for nearly five years, which is ex-
pected to continue in the short term.
Generally, stocks in this group could
not be classified as growth situations
from their performances in terms of
market appreciation since 1960 and
should now be treated as cyclical
issues. Their future performance will
undoubtedly be effected by resistance
levels caused by the high points of the
past seven years.
BMI: The performance of this stock
since 1960 must be disappointing to
investors, as it has been unable to
rise above $2.71 and has already fallen
to a low point of $1.38 this year.
Even the long-term investors who
bought near the low point of 1960
would not be showing any capital gain.
A further decline to approximately


$1.15 is quite likely in the short term,
but this could well be the end of the
downward cycle.
BRICKWORKS is a clear case of
strong resistance level about $B.OO and
support level about $4.80. The present
time is a critical one for this stock,
and if prices recede toward $6.50 in
the short term, the possibility of a fur-
ther decline to approximately $5.80
would have to be considered where
fairly strong support would be forth-
coming. The situation would call for
reassessment at this level, but from
the 1965/66 trading area it would be
possible to expect the stock to fall to
a more pessimistic target at the $4.80
support level.
HUNTER DOUGLAS at this point
seems unlikely to repeat the meteoric
rise toward the end of 1960 which took
prices to an all-time high of $2.46.
Since then prices have retreated to a
low point of $1.50, which would be
considered a support level, and any
penetration below this price could be
followed by a decline to the next sup-
port level between $l.OO and $l.lO.
PGH appears to be in the last phase
of the downtrend which commenced
early 1965 as a result of the “topping”
of prices during the whole of 1964.
The downtrend has accelerated this
year after breaking the last support
levels of 1960 and 1963 in May, and
prices could fall to approximately 95c
in the short term. The past history of
this stock would indicate that no sud-
den reversal is likely to occur, and a
sideways movement could follow for
quite some time.
PIONEER CONCRETE would cer-
tainly not be a stock for a long-term
investor, but it appreciated rapidly in
1961 and 1963 and good profits would
have been shown by shorter-term
holders who bought near the low points
around the $l.OO level. It’ has nothing
to recommend it on technical grounds
at this stage. The top formation of
1964 gives a downside target of $l.OO,
which has recently been confirmed by
a consolidation pattern with “bearish”
implications. Any penetration of the
support level at $1.25 could be fol-
lowed by a decline to approximately
$l.OO.
WORMALD BROS, has depreci-
ated considerably from the high point
of $3.50 in 1960 and must be a depress-
ing sight to long-term holders. At
this stage it shows no signs of recovery,
and the recent sudden drop out of the
last congestion zone would indicate
that the sharp fall could continue to
approximately 90c-95c. At this point
a reaction would be expected, there
being no further downside targets in
sight.

MAN ON THE LAND
Need for a North-South Road
ALL the grand plans for develop-
ment in Australia would fill not
one book but dozens. Yet there
is one plan which is comparatively
simple and which has never had the
attention it seems to deserve. This
is an all-weather, sealed North-South
highway running from Bourke to
Echuca on the Murray.
The road is, in a primitive way,
already in existence and has been ever
since the earliest days of pastoral
development. It is the natural stock
route of the Murray-Darling basin. The
State boundaries—lines on a map—
should be ignored. This is one
geographical area. It is the Great
Riverina Plain.
The North-South stock route has one
supreme quality—it is all “downhill.”
There are some swellings and outcrops,
of course, and the sandy hills topped
by the Murray Pine, but it was pos-
sible in the early days to ride a horse
from Echuca up to Bourke, by way
of Deniliquin, Hay, Booligal, Hillston,
and Cobar, and not once have to get
off to climb a mountain or cut a way
through forest.
Water stopped them, though. There
are still reminders in place-names like
Turn Back Jimmy Creek. If the creek
happened to be dry they did turn
back. But not now. Today the semi-
trailers transport considerable numbers
of sheep along this North-South route.
The need for a proper highway has
been demonstrated. Traffic already
exists. It would swell tremendously
once the route was given an all-weather
surface. The Riverina mud bogged
the horse teams and the semi is no
less vulnerable. For the last few seasons
there has not been much mud, "of
course. The effect of the drought
would have been much worse, though,
had it not been for the semi-trailers.
Sheep from as far north in Queens-
land as Winton, and even beyond, came
down through Longreach, Blackall,
Charleville, Cunnamulla, and Bar-
ringun to Bourke and then on down to
Hay. At Hay, sheep destined for South
Australia were switched on to the Sturt
Highway—a first-class road. Sheep,
and cattle, have been taken right across
to Esperance in Western Australia this
way. Probably the bulk of the North-
South traffic goes on to Deniliquin,
a booming inland selling centre, or
right on to Echuca and then Mel-
bourne.
Victoria is not a plain, but it is a
remarkable fact that the road from
Echuca down through Heathcote to
Melbourne is comparatively level going.
There is an alternative to the Echuca-
Melbourne route, but probably it will
never come into existence in our time.
This would be a new highway straight
through from Echuca to Portland. Last
century, a plan was drawn up for a
canal from Echuca to Portland. Some
survey work was actually done. But
this was before Separation, which pre-
ceded Federation. Australia was being
settled by Anglo-Saxons who were still
maritime- and canal-minded. Echuca,
a sleepy town with the once busy
wharves now rotting, was second only to
Melbourne as a port. It dreamed of
being the St. Louis of the Murray-
Darling and the capital of a new State
called Riverine.
railways killed the dream. The
railways in N.S.W. went east-west
to Sydney, and in Victoria north-south
to Melbourne. Riverina was the end
of the line for both State systems.
Railways were a stimulus to Federation
but at the same time must have been
a big factor against the creation of
any new States—which might have been
even better than Federation.
At long last things seem to be mov-
ing. A couple of weeks ago thirty
delegates and observers attended a
meeting in Condobolin to discuss a
North-South highway. The shires rep-
resented were Bland, Bogan, Car-
rathool, Cobar, Central Darling, Darl-
ing, Hay, Lachlan, Leeton, Wentworth,
and Condobolin. The Federal Inland
Development Organisation gave its sup-
port to the meeting.
There was agreement that a highway
should be built from Bourke to Echuca
in “as direct a line as practicable.”
More meetings are scheduled. Every
shire council whose area is 150 miles
either side of a line from Bourke to
Echuca has been asked for support and
most have indicated they will give it.
It appears that these shires, this time,
will be able to reach agreement on the
exact route the highway should take
even though every town cannot be on it.
A highway does not create the same
tensions as a railway. A branch road,

linking a town with the highway, can
be built by a shire, whereas a branch
railway cannot. Besides, the east-west
roads are reasonable as they stand.
This is at least one movement in Aus-
tralia where petty jealousies seem to be
altogether absent.
But the reaction of the N.S.W. and
Victorian Government Railways will
be interesting. State Governments arc
still more railway-minded than semi-
trailer-minded. If the North-South
Highway is to be built the Federal
Government must come in. Would it,
in the face of State Government
apathy?
The chances are that the Victorian
Government may be more enthusiastic
than the N.S.W. Government. Denili-
quin already considers itself more Vic-
torian than New South Welsh. The rea-
son is fairly simple. Deniliquin to Mel-
bourne is an easy two days by semi-
trailer. Deniliquin to Sydney is a difficult
three or even four days. It is true,
perhaps, that if this highway were built
that Homebush might suffer and New -
market might gain. But is this as
important, in the long run, as the
prospects for places such as Echuxa.
Deniliquin, Hay, and many other in-
land centres?
J)ENILIQUIN, one of the busiest
markets in Australia for Merino
sheep, may in time be a big market for
British breeds and lambs and would
seem to be ideally located as an inland
killing centre geared to fast road trans-
port.
We must be careful, though. We flv
no special flag for Deniliquin even
though it is a charming town. Maybe
one of the others will be the one to
grow. Ideally they all should grow .
The Riverina is changing. Private
irrigation is on the increase, and so is
the growing of feed grains. There is
a pattern here for future development
which could be an answer to the night-
mare of unlimited Melbourne (01
Sydney) growth.
A new inland highway system, of
which the North-South and the Sturt
would form an inner half circle as it
were, is logical and feasible. As people
have been using this North-South route
for well over 100 years it would seem
to indicate that the idea is sound and
has been shown to be sound.
It is difficult not to agree with the
Australian Automobile Association’s
view that “Federal activity in regard to
land transport is most unsatisfactory.”
While the Federal Government controls
the pursestrings for road programs, its
road-transport role is minor compared
with, say, civil aviation. Thq Depart-
ment of Shipping and Transport is said
to have 90 percent of its staff working on
shipping and associated matters and only
ten percent on road and rail transport.
Yet we are one of the biggest users of
cars and trucks in the world, the private
motorist is taxed unmercifully, the
stock transporter is hounded with regu-
lations and paperwork, and the roads
system generally is quite inadequate.

AGRISEARCH
The Dairy-Beef Disgrace
THE wastage of bobby calves in this
country is a national problem—
and disgrace. Well over 1J
million are being slaughtered each year.
In the U.K., on the other hand, they
are cherished. As a result, 80 per-
cent of the domestic beef of England
is raised on dairy farms. Here the
figure would be less than 10 percent
and still falling.
Great changes in consumer tastes
and in export market opportunities
have occurred in recent years. The
local market, now strongly influenced
by New Australians, wants lean beef,
while the U.S.A., Europe, the U.K.,
and Japan have become accustomed
to taking large quantities of boneless
beef such as is obtained from poorer
quality stock, including dairy culls sold
in lean condition.
Quite a number of our dairy farmers
have not been slow in recognising the
new possibilities, of course. These
pioneers of a new industry have already
accumulated some valuable experience
which can serve as a useful guide to
anyone thinking of going into the dairy-
beef business. Their financial situation
appears to be most encouraging.
Dairy farmers who have broadened
their operations to include beef pro-
duction are confident that they have
done the right thing. An economic
survey conducted by Mr. D. J. Hard-
man, of the Bureau of Agricultural
Economics, shows this view to be cor-
rect —at least in Western Australia.
The economics of the business has
been studied only in that State so far.
Mr. Hardman chose to begin in the
West because dairying there has always
been a tougher fight to make ends
meet than in any other State, not
forgetting Queensland. Consequently,
beef as a sideline could make a more
significant contribution to profit on
a Western Australian dairy farm than
it would elsewhere. Both wholemilk
and butterfat producers were included
in the study, which was pursued over
three financial years and involved a
total of 50 farms chosen at random.
Thirty-three of these had integrated
some form of beef production with the
main business of dairying, but the re-
maining 17 were typical, simple dairy
farms.
everything was accounted for,
the dairy-beef farms averaged a net
income of $'3887, whereas the non-beef
dairy farms averaged $2893 —a dif-
ference of 34 percent. However, since
the dairy-beef farms were more highly
capitalised they return a somewhat
lower dividend on the invested capital
(9.5 percent) than the non-beef
farms (11.4 percent). The beef side-
line contributed about 18 percent to
each dairy-beef farmer’s gross income.
The data available to Mr. Hardman
did Hot permit him to calculate
whether some other sideline would have
been even more profitable. But this
is unlikely because most other possible
sidelines, such as pigs, would demand
at least as much labor and equipment
as calf-rearing, and the product may
Hot be as valuable as a well-grown
vealer. The Western Australian dairy-
beef people consulted by Mr. Hard-
man all felt satisfied about this and
most said they planned to expand the
beef side of their farms. The chaps
who hadn’t “got with it” blamed their
farms for being too small or claimed
that managing the dairy herd properly
was a full-time job.
Some research has started, designed
to find the most suitable animals and
management systems for a dairy-beef
industry. For example, the Victorian
Department of Agriculture has released
preliminary information on the per-
formance of various crossbreeds on its
Ellinbank Dairy Research Station.
There, Jersey, Angus, Angus-x-Jersey,
and Hereford-x-Jersey calves are reared
individually, each getting identical
quantities of milk until they are weaned
at 18 weeks of age. At 52 weeks, live-
weight gain, carcass gain, efficiency of
gain, body composition, and carcass
quality are measured. The figures
found suggest that the two crossbreeds
are evenly matched and in most charac-
teristics outperform the purebreds.
Moreover, the figures show that most
of the meat trade’s prejudices against
stock of part-dairy origin are quite
unjustified.
r pHIS Victorian study is even more
significant in view of the fact that
the Jersey breed has always been re-
garded as being inimical to any form
of beef production. Jerseys, therefore,,
contribute the majority of bobby
calves which are wastefully slaughtered.
Also, the Jersey is the commonest
breed on the butterfat farms. As the
Western Australian survey showed,
these lend themselves better than
wholemilk farms to dairy-beef pro-
duction.
The Agricultural Production Council
of New Zealand envisages that dairy
beef could become a large industry,
worth possibly £NZ27.5 million a
year. On this account, it has already
worked out plans in some detail for
salvaging bobby calves and developing
the industry as rapidly as possible.
The Council has estimated that if
600,000 dairy-bred calves can be saved
and raised to 20 months, the country’s
beef exports will double. Arrange-
ments are in hand for the provision
of loans to dairymen who need cash
to get started. Butter factories and
slaughter-houses are to be asked to-
set up large-scale, calf-rearing units to-
take over the bobbies that cannot be
retained on the farms.
Last month New Zealand’s first
Charolais-Jersey cross calves began to
arrive. The Charolais semen had been
imported from England in order to
implement stage one of the Council’s:
plan for establishing a vigorous dairy-
beef industry The breed is the first
to be admitted to the country since
1947. New Zealand’s quarantine
authority apparently considered that
the risks were small compared to the
potential advantages of having this
magnificent French beef animal, which
crosses so effectively with the dairy
breeds. England and America have
already imported whole herds safety.
Perhaps Australia is being altogether
too cautious.

SPECULATORS DIARY
The Rights of Spring
ANNUAL reports and chairmen’s addresses have been flooding in and it takes
all one’s time to keep up with them. Most of them express some caution
about the immediate future. So, to avoid painting too dismal a picture,
several chairmen have adopted the device of enthusing about the long term.
Just two examples of this — ARC
in its annual report stated: “Australia
will see in the next 35 years as much
building activity as has been experi-
enced in the 196 years of its history.”
And the chairman of Canberra Tele-
vision in his address gave the follow-
ing estimates of Canberra population:
From the present figure of 100,000, it
should rise to 150,000 in the early
’seventies and reach 500,000 by the end
of the century.
On the subject of looking into the
future, it’s worth reading the annual
report of the Australian Atomic
Energy Commission. In that report it
is stated: “The price of uranium is
likely to rise considerably, and sub-
stantial new discoveries will be neces-
sary.” It further states that nuclear
power would cost less than previously
expected. Consequently, it would favor
the introduction of nuclear power
stations earlier than expected. While
neither MKU nor United Uranium
were bought at bargain prices, at least
I have them in the portfolio.
Gold is the other major form of
mining in the portfolio. Mr. McMahon
very kindly decided to give it a bit of
a push when he expressed his views on
gold in Parliament last Tuesday. He
stated that any currency created should
be tied to gold in so far as it was a
commodity in short supply. Rather than
urging an increase in the price of
gold, he favored increased subsidies as
an incentive to boost gold production.
I’m hoping to see Emperor Gold
move above 50c in the current flurry.
In the meantime, I’ll stay with Gold
Mines of Kalgoorlie.
From gold and uranium in the min-
ing market, I transfered my attention
to the several rights issues now being
traded in the industrial market. The
best move by any of them so far is
Schweppes, which has risen from 78c
to $1.03.
At the other end of the alphabet is
G. J. Coles rights. As yet, there has
been little price movement but there
is still some seven weeks before the
trading in these rights finishes. The
last issue of renounceable rights by
G. J. Coles was in 1961. Anyone who
bought these rights within a month of
the opening of the issue and sold at
the end of the issue would have been
well satisfied. (From a steady price of
around 60c the rights had moved
up very smartly to close at 85c.) The
extraordinary part about this last issue
was that the shares held steady in the
two months preceding the issue. This
contrasts to the current issue when the
Sir of

Buckinghams.
Buying into the retail trade.
shares cum the rights fell back from
$1.30 to $1.15.
Therefore either through a recovery
in the shares to former price levels or
through just steady demand, the rights
price could easily be triggered off from
the present level. The 1000 rights at
34c required an outlay of $349.
Although the other purchase of the
week also involved 1000 shares, the
total cost was only $133. Even though
Buckinghams appeared to have passed
its crisis, the shares have continued to
drift down. Like so many retailers
caught by “clear out” debtors in the
early ’sixties, a “do-or-die” effort was
made in 1964. Since then, the com-
pany has managed to show a small
profit in both the 1965 and 1966 years.
If, as directors claim, the debt position
is under full control, and it is only the
st’agnant trading conditions that hold
the company back, then surely the
shares must be worth at least 13c.
With Mt. Isa shares showing little
life, it was with some reluctance that
I decided to part with 100. It still
leaves me with 100 shares, so I’ll not
miss out altogether if the market ever
does suddenly recognise the full poten-
tial of the company.

When you plan your next business
trip, plan to fly a DC-8 or DC-9 and
discover the Douglas difference in
design.
From its powerful, proved engines
to its sleek, spacious airframe to its
smooth, quiet.flight —the great
Douglas DC-8 offers air travelers
a high level of dependability and
comfort unsurpassed by any big jet

The Sherry of Australia
Of all the products of Australian vines, none has achieved greater fame than Mildara Sherry. The grapes used are
Palomino, Pedro and Doradillo. Mildara Sherry like many others owes its distinctive taste and bouquet to a secondary
culture of flor yeast. After the flor process, the wines mature in oak casks for many years and are blended in a range of
classic styles to suit different tastes. MILDARA SUPREME DRY SHERRY, the true, pale, dry, delicate style of Spanish Fino,
was first laid down in 1936 and the quality and original unique style have been maintained by the technical staff throughout
the years. It is the finest wine of its type produced in Australia. MILDARA GEORGE DRY SHERRY is of the same quality
as Supreme but of greater age and completely dry. This pale flor-style sherry is free of dextrose and levulose, so interests
people on a non-sugar diet. MILDARA CHESTNUT TEAL, is for those who prefer a delicious full-bodied wine; here is a flor
sherry of the Oloroso style, mellow and fruity. RIO VISTA FLOR DRY SHERRY, is a flor Amontillado style but light; a sherry
with a pleasing blend of flavour and a palate most attractive to the knowledgeable sherry drinker. Rio VISTA MEDIUM
SHERRY, combines the “flor” character of Rio Vista Dry Sherry with the softness of Rio Vista Cream for those who like
their sherry soft, but not too sweet. RIO VISTA CREAM SHERRY is a true flor sherry with a pleasing sweetness and mellow
finish, with emphasis on the subtle, smooth flavour of the grape.
MILDARA it makes a host of difference
