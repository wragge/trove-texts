The Ways of Many Waters
Collects the clashing ballads and verses of sailor-men’s
and wharf-men’s life which E. J. Brady has contributed
to The Bulletin and the Sunday Times, Sydney. It is
the first attempt on the part of an Australian verse-
writer to chant the life on the 'sea and the margins of
the sea ; though there is one horse-poem—the story of
“ How Jack Bowlin Steered ‘ Jones.’ ” The volume is
bound in buckram, with gilt top, in a size that will go
into a pocket without squeezing ; and the price is 55.,
post-free.
Roderic Quinn’s selection of verses,
The Hidden Tide,
is issued in a substantial booklet, and special care has
been taken to make the typography attractive. The
edition is limited to 500 numbered copies on small
paper at Is. 9d. posted, and 15 copies on large paper
at 10s. 6d. (posted 11s.). The large-paper edition
contains an unpublished poem in the author’s holo-
graph.
In the volume of
Fair Girls and Gray Horses
Will Ogilvie has given what Victor Daley calls “the
most charming book of verses yet issued in Aus-
tralia.” The second edition is considerably enlarged
and improved, and the publishers have been informed
by a happy lover that “it makes the beautifullest
present.” The price is 4s. 6d. post free.

"My Lady Sleeps."
BLEEP, ANGBY BEAUTY!
Sleep, angry beauty, sleep and fear not me 1
For who a sleeping lion dares provoke ?
It shall suffioe me here to sit and see
Those lips shut up that never kindly spoke:
What sight can more content a lover’s mind
Than beauty seeming harmless, if not kind ?
My words have charmed her, for secure she sleeps,
Though guilty much of wrong done to my love;
And in her slumber, see ! she closed-eye weeps:
Dreams often more than waking passions move.
Plead, Sleep, my cause, and make her soft like
thee:
That she in peace may wake and pity me.
T. Campion.
LINES.
On seeing my wife and two children sleeping in the
same chamber.
And has the earth lost its so spacious round,
The sky its blue circumference above,
That In this little chamber there is found
Both earth and heaven—my universe of love I
All that my God can give me, or remove,
Here sleeping, save myself,' in mimic death.
Sweet that in this small compass I behove
To live their living, and to breath their breath !
Almost I wish that, with one common sigh,
We might resign all mundane care and strife,
And seek together that transcendent sky,
Where Father, Mother, Children, Husband, Wife,
Together pant in everlasting life.
Thomas Hood.
MY LADY SLEEP.
In cool, gray cloisters walks my Lady Sleep,
Telling her smooth beads slowly, one by one ;
Along the wall the stealthy shadows creep ;
Night holds the world in thrall, and day is done.
Sometimes, while winds sigh soft above her head,
Down the long garden path my Lady strays,
And, kneeling by the pansies’ purple bed,
Counts the small faces on the moonlit haze.
Sometimes she lies upon the silver sands,
Following the sea-birds as they wheel and dip ;
Or idly -clasps, in still persistent hands,
The shining grains that through her fingers slip.
Or paces long, with flowing locks all wet.
Where the low thunder booms forevermore,
And the great waves no man hath numbered yet,
Roll, one by one, to break upon the shore.
Sometimes she counts the brightening twilight
stars,
The daisies smiling in the meadow grass,
The slow kine trailing through the pasture bars,
The white sheep loitering in the mountain pass.
But evermore her hands are cool and calm —
Her quiet voice is ever hushed and low;
And evermore her tranquil lips breathe balm,
And silent as a dream her garments flow.
She comes, she goes—whence, whither—who can
tell?
Angels of God, do ye her secret keep ?
Know ye the talisman, the sign, the spell,
The mystic password of my Lady Sleep ?
Julia C. R. Dorr.
At the Hotel Grenoble.
When the Poet of England Lay Nigh Unto Death.
After the last reporter had gone, buttoning his
overcoat as he faced the stormy night, the clerk at
the desk sat down wearily. The group that re-
mained sitting on the bench over by the wall
where the bulletin hung would not worry him.
Very little hope had these latter found in the news
from the sick-room. They muttered rather than
talked, like men who had exhausted their subject
and had nothing but fragments to offer. Molder,
thin and sallow, was himself a poet. Hollo, the
story-writer, with great robustness of body and
brusque ways, turned to the poet and said :
“ The bigger a doctor the more of a mystery-
monger. That bulletin tells nothing.”
“ I’m thinking of Kipling, not the doctor,” said
Molder —“ the things that Kipling has left unsaid :
the youth of him and the glory of him that will
not die with him.” Molder’s voice died away—not
the faint dying away of a failing thought, but as
if it was gradually withdrawing into the cavern of
I Contemplation where it was continuing to resound
to deeper purpose.
“I’m going,” said the sharp-voiced, sharp-faced,
spectacled-boy at the story-teller’s elbow. He had
haunted the corridor since the poet’s illness was
first announced. “I shall dread taking up the
papers in the morning.”
He was gone.
The story-teller looked about. He had seen it
all so often the last three nights—the lowered
lights, the dimness, the porter sauntering in and
leaning heavily about, the telegraph-messenger
entering and departing after his ticket was signed
—the messenger who added one more bead to the
rosary of love for the poet who lay wrestling the
Dark Angel on the floor above. All the “ color ”
and “ atmosphere ” that were in it, he had taken
in and labelled —perhaps for future use—as Kip-
ling would have done. He stood up with a
recurrence of his old thought:
“ I have watched him from his first beginnings
m India —heard of him queerly from there when
he was sub-editing, when he was in the Swin-
burne, Bret Harte, Edgar Allan Poe parody
stage, and beginning to tell his Indian stories in
the manliest prose of the century. Just think of
it—all that swarming, colorful life of India —a
hundred years of it, the native side, the garrison
side, nine or ten generations of English soldiers
and civilians,, and nobody to tell about it at all till
Kipling took thought and raised the veil. Beal,
too, by thunder; haunting words, haunting pic-
tures, but an idealism of courage and devotion
lighting it all up—-the regimental idea. That’s in
his blood. It was after he went back to England
that the regiment became something bigger. He
fell in with the Jingos and wrote their gospel: he
has been writing it ever since—first in ringing
slang, and now in verse that has the immortalities
about it. But if that were all I wouldn’t be here
to-night. What he preaches may matter to you,
Molder. Neither the upper thought nor the
under-thought of his verses—neither the bugle-
blowing nor the dagger-thrusting appeals to me.
The Eurasian savagery of it, the joy in bloodshed,
the frank acceptance of the mire and stench of the
shambles for the sake of the glory—that repels
me. It feeds massed vanity. For all the clear
clarion in the tone there is confusion in the
moralities of it.”
“He outgrew the regiment: he’ll outgrow the
Jingo,” said Molder, looking up, though he had
not appeared to be listening.
“Outgrow?” said Hollo, bending down and
looking into Molder’s deep eyes. Then he looked
towards the discouraging, all but hopeless, bulle-
tin.
_ “Yes,” said Molder, “ outgrow. If God spares
him he will grow as he has grown : if God takes
him, the silver and gold of him will sift them-
selves from the dross of little politics and con-
tracted aims. Why do you love him, Hollo ? ”
“Because he loves,” said the story-teller, “be-
cause he feels, and toils and tells so robustly: for
the scenes he has pictured ; the inanimate he has
animated ; the unsuspected worlds he has dis-
covered—because—well, because he has chiselled
out rough lovable men in a world of letters devoted'
to finicking women ; because he is so easily what
I, what a thousand of us, would like to be. I love
him—damn it!—l love the sum total of him.”
He pulled his soft hat further down his forehead
and was gone.
' Molder fell asleep. Messenger boys, with tele-
grams and cables, kept coming and going. They
had taken the plaoe of the throng of the day and
the crowd of the evening. The far places of the
world were calling, calling. A party of young
men and women, fresh from a ball, tne dancing-
sparkle still in their eyes, came rustling in, a dozen
or more of them. They came atiptoe, as if it were
the hushed sick-room upstairs, where the poet lay,
and not the public corridor of the hotel. They
stood mute, and sorrowful about the bulletin, and
whispered. Their eyes fell on Molder. They
stood round him and tittered.
He wakened and rubbed his eyes.
“Shadows,” he murmured to himself—“shad-
ows.”
He rose and they fell away before him. “ I
knew they were shadows ” —he said, as he walked
toward the door. He halted, for he heard a foot
on the stair. There was some one coming down.
There would be news.
Then the front door swung open and a mul-
titude, real and tangible now, came trooping in, at
their head three stalwart, red-coatedmen.
Mulvaney, Learoyd, and Ortheris.
Then a group of languid, pale women in their
finery, with world-wise smiles and rich flower-
scents in their hair, with beckonings and sidewise
glances.
Mrs. Hauksbee and her sisters of the station.
At their heels came Otis Yeere and a press of
clinking and clattering young subalterns, and then
the drinking, sallow colonels and majors.
Dark faces under coiled white turbans, men
with strange curved knives at their waists and
hate in their hearts under the servility of their
gestures, came tripping and slinking on bare or
slippered feet.
Indian Princes and Benares priests and beggars
and workers and little Hindoo babies in their
mothers’ arms. And Sepoys and Sikhs, and
Pathans, and Dacoits, and Gunga Din, the water-
bearer.
A pale soldier man, wide-eyed, collarless, with
the Dead March ringing in his ears and the
shadow of a gallows thrown across him from the
sun of morning.
A battle-maddened negro with a spear and
shield, a hero’s deed behind him and a machine-
gun bullet in his breast.
Frowsy writers of Fleet-street and a blind artist
led by a girl—not so clear or real these, for all
their commonness.
Swart men of the straits, ship-captains of the
tropics, engineers grimed and grim, contractors
and coolies.
Now sailors from the Arctic seas with the salt
spray on their oilskins and the wind still tossing
their hair. And railroad men grasping tufts of
blackened cotton waste.
At their heels pressed in a strange army of
animals, the brethren of the jungle, so real, so
strange. For a space all was silence. Then a
voice came from the stairs.
What word did Molder hear ?
What lighted up the faces of these ardently liv-
ing, colorful people that he knew so well ?
What gave the troop of young revellers j-the
people who seemed shadows to the poet’s mind—
their sudden smiles and loosed their tongues,
as they moved to the street ?
What sent the messenger-boys scudding to the
telegraph-offices ?
The word that came down from the sick cham-
ber : Life.
So Molder went home, two glad tears clinging
to his lashes.
J. I. 0. Clarke, in The Criterion.
The Brownings and Blush.
The episode of the stealing of Flush is one
of the most interesting in the new books of
Browning love-letters. Flush was Elizabeth
Barrett’s dog—her dearest possession in the
world, and when he is stolen she is disconso-
late indeed. And she writes to Robert
Browning, her lover—
Here is a distress for me, dearest! I have lost
my poor Flush— lost him ! You were a prophet
when you said “Take cure.”
This morning Arabel and I, and he with us,
went in a cab to Yere-street, where we had a
little business, and he followed us, as usual, into a
shop and out of it again, and was at my heels
when I stepped up into the carriage. Having
turned, I said “Flush,” and Arabel looked round
for Flush—there was no Flush ! He had been
caught up in that moment from tinder the wheels,
do you understand ? and the thief must have run
with him, and thrown him into a bag, perhaps.
It was such a shock to me—think of it! losing
him in a moment, so/ No wonder I looked white,
as Arabel said! So she began to comfort
me by showing me how certain it was that
I should recover him for ten pounds at most, and
we came home ever so drearily. Because Flush
doesn’t know that we can recover him, and he is
in the extremest despair all the while, poor darling
Flush, with his fretful fears, and pretty whims,
and his fancy of being near me. All this night he
will howl and lament, I know perfectly; for I
fear we shall not ransom him to-night. Henry
went down for me directly to the captain of the
banditti —who evidently knew all about it, said
Henry—and, after a little form of consideration
and enquiry, promised to let us hear something
this evening, but has not come yet. In the morh-
ing, perhaps, he will come. Henry told him that
I was resolved not to give much ; but, of course,
they will make me give what they choose. lam
not going to leave Flush at their mercy, and they
know that as well as I do. My poor Flush !
When we shall be at Pisa, dearest, we shall be
away from the London dog-stealers—it will be one
of the advantages.
* * « *
Browning—selfish man ! —expresses a per-
functory grief—
Poor Flush —how sorry I am for you, my Ba!
But you will recover him, I dare say . . . not,
perhaps, directly; the delay seems to justify their
charge at the end : poor fellow —was he no better
than the rest of us, and did all that barking and
fanciful valor spend itself on such enemies as Mr.
Kenyon and myself, leaving only blandness and
waggings of the tail for the man with the bag ? I
am sure you are grieved and frightened for our
friend and follower, that was to be, at Pisa—will
you not write a special note to tell pie when you
get him again ?
• * • •
And Elizabeth is quick to detect the false
note—
“ Our friend and follower that was to be”—is
that, then, your opinion of my poor darling Flush’s
destiny. Ah, I should not have been so quiet if I
had not known differently and better. I “ shall
not recover him directly, ” you think ! But, dear-
est, I am sure that I shall. I am learned in the
ways of the Philistines —I knew from the begin-
ning where to apply and how to persuade. The
worst is poor Flush’s fright and suffering. And
then, it is inconvenient just now to pay the ransom
for him. But we shall have time to-morrow if not
to-night. Two hours ago the chief of the Con-
federacy came to call on Henry and to tell him
that the “Society had the dog,” having done us
the honour of tracking us into Bond-street and
out of Bond-street into Vere-street where
he was kidnapped. Now he is in White-
chapel (poor Flush). And the great man
was going down there at half-past seven
to meet other great men in council and hear the
decision as to the ransom exacted, and would re-
turn with their ultimatum. Oh, the villainy of it
is excellent, and then the humiliation of having to
pay for your own vexations and anxieties ! Will
they have the insolence, now, to make me pay £lO
as they said they would ? But I must have Flush,
you know ; I can’t run any risk, and bargain and
haggle. There is a dreadful tradition in this
neighborhood of a lady who did so, having her
dog’s head sent to her in a parcel. So I say to
Henry, “Get Flush back, whatever you do,” for
Henry is angry, as he may well be, and as I should
be if I were not too afraid . . . and talks police-
officers against thieves, and finds it very hard to
attend to my instructions and be civil and re-
spectful to their captain. There he found him,
smoking a cigar in a room with pictures ! They
make some £3OOO or £4OOO a year by their honor- .
able employment. As to- Flush’s following any-
one “blandly,” never think it. He was caught
up and gagged . . . depend upon that. If he
could have bitten he would have bitten; —if he
could have yelled he would have yelled. Indeed,
on a former occasion the ingenuous thief observed
that he- “ was a difficult dog to get, he was so dis-
trustful.” They had to drag him with a string,
put him in a oab, they said, before. Poor Flush !
* * * *
Then Robert rises to the occasion—plainly,
it must be taken seriously ; but he does not
rise with a good grace. He is a little
aggrieved that his troubles should be tem-
porarily forgotten in the greater trouble of
Flush; and he lectures his lady on lofty
grounds of public morality.
I am rejoiced that poor Flush is found again,
dearest —altogether rejoiced.
And now that you probably have him by your
side, I will tell you what I should have done in
such a case, because it explains our two ways of
seeing and meeting oppression lesser or greater.
I would not have given five shillings on that
fellow’s application. I would have said —and in
entire earnestness — you are responsible for the pro-
ceedings of your gang, and you I mark—don’t talk
nonsense to me about cutting off heads or paws.
Be as sure as that I stand here and tell you, I will
spend my whole life in putting you down, the
nuisance you declare yourself and by every
imaginable means I will be the death of you and
as many of your accomplices as I can discover—
but you I have discovered and will never lose sight
of—now try my sincerity, by delaying to produce
the dog by to-morrow. And for the ten pounds—
see ! Whereupon I would give them to the first
beggar in the street. You think I should receive
Flush’s head ? Perhaps— so God allows matters to
happen L on purpose, it may be, that I should vin-
dicate him by the punishment I would exact.
Observe, Ba, this course ought not to be yours,
because it could not be—it would not suit your
other qualities. But all religion, right, and jus-
tice, with me, seem implied in such a resistance to
wickedness and refusal to multiply it a hundred-
fold—for this prompt payment of ten pounds for
a few minutes’ act of the easiest villainy,
there will be encouragement to—how many similar
acts in the course of next month ? And how will
the poor owners fare who have not money enough
for their dogs’ redemption ? I suppose the gentle-
man, properly disgusted with such obstinacy, will
threaten roasting at a slow fire to test the sincerity
of attachment! No—the world would grow too
detestable a den of thieves and oppressors that
way !
* * • •
But Elizabeth will have none of the moral
grounds : she wants Flush, and her loving
instinct makes pitiful hay of Browning’s
arguments.
Poor Flush ! ... I have not got him baok yet
—no, indeed.
I should have done it. The arohfiend, Taylor,
the man whom you are going to spend your life in
persecuting (the life that belongs to me, too !),
came last night to say that they would accept six
pounds, six guineas, with half a guinea for him-
self, considering the trouble of the mediation ; and
Papa desired Henry to refuse to pay, and not to
tell me a word about it—all of which I did not
find out till this morning. Now it is less, as the
money goes, than I expected, and I was very
vexed and angry, and wanted Henry to go at
once and conclude the business—only he wouldn’t ;
talked of Papa, and persuaded me that Taylor
would come to-day with a lower charge. He has
not come —I knew he would not come—and if
people won’t do as I choose, I go down
to-morrow morning myself and bring Flusli back
with me. Ail this time he is suffering, and I
am suffering. It may be very foolish —I do not say
it is not—or it may be “awful sin,” as Mr. Boyd
sends to assure me—but I cannot endure to run
oruel hazards about my poor Flush for the sake of
a few guineas, or even for the sake of abstract
principles of justice—l cannot. You say that I
cannot, . . . but that you would. You would !
Ah, dearest—most pattern of citizens, but you
would not— l know you better. Your theory is
far too good not to fall to pieces in practioe.' A
man may love justice intensely ; but the love of an
abstract principle is not the strongest love—now is
it ? Let us consider a little, putting poor Flush
out of the question. (You would bear, you say, to
receive his head in a paroel—it would satisfy
you to cut off Taylor’s in return.) Do
you mean to say that if the banditti came
down on us in Italy and carried me off to the
mountains, and, sending to you one of my ears, to
show you my probable fate if you did not let them
have . . how much may I venture to say lam
worth ? . . five or six scudi —(is that reasonable
at all?) . . would your answer be “Not so many
orazie ” ; and would you wait, poised upon abstract
principles, for the other ear, and the catastrophe,—
as was done in Spain not long ago? Would you,
dearest ? Because it is well to know beforehand,
perhaps. *
“ Unreasonable woman ! ” But Browning
humours her.
Dear Ba, —I wrote under the notion (as I said)
that poor Flush was safe by your side, and only
took that occasion to point out what I must still
consider the wrongness of the whole system of
giving way to, instead of opposing, such proceed-
ings. I think it lamentable weakness . . . though
I can quite understand and allow for it in you;
but Weakness it essentially is, as you know per-
fectly.
. . . You have a great answer—“ What should
I do if you were to be the victim ? ” That my
note yesterday, the second one, told you. I sacri-
fice myself ... all that belongs to me; but there
are some interests which I belong to —I have no
right, no more than inclination, in such a case, to
think of myself if your safety is concerned, and
as I could cut off a limb to save my head, so my
head should fall most willingly to redeem yours.
... I would pay every farthing I had in the
world, and shoot with my own hand the receiver
of it after a chase of fifty years—esteeming that to
be a very worthy recompense for the trouble.
But why write all this string of truisms about
the plainest thing in the world? All reformers
are met at the outset by such dissuasion from their
efforts. Better suffer the grievance and get off as
cheaply as you (can); You, Mahomet—what if
the Caaba he only a black stone ? You need only
bow your head as the others, and make any in-
ward remark you like on the blindness of the
people. You, Hampden, have you really so little .
wit as to contest payment of a paltry 20s. at such
risk?
* * * *
And presently Flush is restored, and the
incident is ended, having cast much light on
the characters of the famous correspondents.
I have not Flush yet. I am to have him to-
morrow morning.
And for the Flush-argument, dear dearest, I hold
that your theory is entirely good and undeniable.
I agree with you throughout it, praising Mahomet,
praising Hampden ... But Flush, poor Flush.
Flush who has loved me so faithfully; have I a
right to sacrifice him in his innocence ? . . . Does
not Flush’s condition assimilate to my own among
the banditti? for you agree that • you would not,
after all, leave me to the banditti —and I, exactly
on the same ground, will not leave Flush. It
seems to me that you and I are at one upon the
whole question —only that I am your Flush, and
fee is mine. You, if you were “consistent” . . .
dearest! . . . would not redeem me on my own
account. You do ever so much harm by it,
observe—you produce catastrophe on catastrophe,
just for the sake of my two ears without earrings !
Oh, I entirely agree with your principle. Evil
should be resisted that it may flee from you.
But Flush is not to be sacrificed —nor even is
Ba, it appears. So our two weaknesses may
pardon one another, yours and mine ! . . . Flush
arrived here at eight o’clock (at the very moment
with your letter, dearest!) and the first thing that
he did was to dash up to this door, and then to
drink his purple cup full of water, filled three
times over. He was not so enthusiastic about
seeing me, as I expected—he seemed bewildered
and frightened—and whenever anyone said to him
“Poor Flush, did the naughty men take you
away?” he put up his head and moaned and
yelled. He has been very unhappy certainly.
Dirty he is, and much thinner, and continually he
is drinking. * Six guineas was his ransom—and
now I have paid twenty for him to the dog-
stealers.

Soreness.
SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS
OF SUFFERING.
Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Malyon, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled w th “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,”
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally rock same “ Cum Grano Sails, ’’ and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with truly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy. I shall
advise ail my friends with skin troubles to use same.
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEORGE J. O’REGAN.
WHAT THE DOCTORS SAY
Doveton-street, Ballarat,
M.v dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard; to my old enemy, “Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suTered, notwithstanding constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliene,
and after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only
add that since I commenced the treatment of myself I have
prescribed it to others, and am still doing so with brilliant
results. Please accept my hearty thanks, and remain yours
sincerely, THOS. LE GAY HOLT HOUSE, M.R.C.S., L.

good. I was hardly able to walk before I got your Belt. —

jRe wireless telegraphy (8., 15/4/'99, p. 13).
About 13 years ago the men who ran Milton and
Milburn railway stations, in Maoriland, used to
be startled by having their telephonic conversa-
tions broken in on by a weird voice from nowhere.
Later on, it was discovered that the owner was
the postmaster at Outram, 30 miles away. A tele-
graph wire from Outram to Tapanui, after
travelling a few miles on the same posts as the
Outram-Mosgiel telephone wire, branched off and
ran parallel for some miles, at a distance of three-
quarters of a mile, to the Milton-Milburn tele-
phone wire. Experts said “induction,” but what
induction was and how to control or utilise it they
didn’t know, and the Outram man continued to
irrupt into Milton-Milburn conversations in a
manner productive of “ language.”
At End of a Holiday.
“Leaves and brambles from hill and hollow
Come and gather,” the children cried ;
“The sun goes down, and the night will follow,
A moonless night on the dark hillside.
All ways they wandered —the dry twigs snapping,
With laugh and prattle and song between ;
Down on the rock the waves were lapping,
The sweet swell swaying the seaweed green.
And she stood by in her white sun-bonnet,
How snowy-white on her tressy hair !
With a gold king-beetle dreaming on it
A lotus dream in the lustrous air.
Was it love, or a dove in the tall tree cooing !
Was it love, or a dove that loitered nigh ?
The eventide is the hour for wooing,
But I was silent and she was shy.
Then suddenly rose a far faint humming—
A growing noise in the evening hush,
And the talk of children homeward coming,
Laden with spoil of the gold-brown bush.
“ Leaves and brambles from hill and hollow ;
The way was tangled and tangles tire.
The sun goes down and the night will follow,
Now down on your knees and make us a fire. ’
The leaves were wet and my hopes were slender,
The brambles damp with a shower at noon ;
She bent to help, and my heart of tinder,
Ah, why did it burst to flame so soon !
“Dry leaves, dry leaves from the twilight forest,
Or bark that is sheltered, or hidden ferns ;
Dry leaves, dry leaves,” the children chorused,
And, “ the drier the leaf the redder it burns.”
The fire leapt up with a sudden glancing,
The first flame flushing her hands of snow ;
And round about went the children dancing,
Their faces lit by the rosy glow.
That fire has gone beyond all returning,
For wild winds scatter and chill rains drench :
All dust the leaves ; but a fire is burning
That wind or water shall never quench.
Leaves and brambles from hill and hollow,
And two together, and violet eyes :
The sun goes down, and Love must follow,
A quenchless fire and a flame that dies.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Days were Golden!
The clouds had each a rainbow rim,
The gracious clouds and golden ;
The stars we knew were never dim,
The songs were quaint and olden ;
With glamor-glow before our eyes
We left the land of worldly-wise,
We watched the suns of glory rise
(Ah, then the Days were golden !). •
The lips we loved were ruby-red
(Ah, sweet the murmurs olden !)
The hair was haloed round the head
(The gracious locks and golden !)
The eyes were always tender-true,
The tale they told was always new,
The wreaths of rose had naught of rue
(Ah, then the Days were golden !).
We loved the glance of flowers a-gleam,
The green that kissed the golden !
Our waking life was drowsy dream
In that dear land and olden ;
Our speech ran o’er with words of wine,
Our shade was shot with silver shine,
Our Human sank in Deeps Divine
(Ah, then the Days were golden !).
We heard the vault in rapture ring
Through many a cycle golden ;
We heard the Sons of Morning sing
In mystic chorus olden ;
We heard the voice of vale and crest,
The bird that sang beside the nest,
The bird that sang within the breast—■
(Ah —then the Days were golden !)
When heart to heart was gently leal,
When Love was fresh and golden,
When Laughter rang in silver peal,
(The peerless Laughter olden !)
When bosoms proud were in their prime,
When elust’ring Joys were in their clime,
When Life was all a rippling rhyme—
Ah —then the Days were golden !

IN AMERICA.
The Legend,
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, havin
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreatin
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and grandson
had accompanied the troops as volunteers,
and were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was;in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on that fateful
day Yankee Hoodie was heard as never
was heard before or since.

Conventional Lies of the Anti-Federal
Party.
The Bulletin has counted up 17 lies on
which the New South Wales Anti-Federal
party principally travels. That party has to
lie for a very sufficient reason. It is made
up mainly of four sections. One is the old
Cabbage-Tree mob or Jackwant party, which
objects to federating with anybody because
it believes that New South Wales is the
centre of the universe, and that the sun
rises in Sydney and sets in Dibbs’s coat-tail
pocket, and that everybody born in Botany
Bay is so much better than anybody else in
all this world, that the idea of him even
condescending to speak to his neighbors is
absurd. Another is the Sydney importing
crowd ; its mission is to discourage local in-
dustry by Freetrade, and it would rather see
the Australian nation sunk in the deep, deep
sea than run the risk of bruising the shoddy
import industry. Also, there are the Sydney
landlords, who want the capital in Sydney so
that the increase of population will send up
their private land-values, and enable them to
grab the unearned increment for their private
pockets, and to raise their rents. And there
is Sydney Daily Telegraph, whose 50 per
cent. Protection must go if Federation ar-
rives. (At present the Telegraph is carried
free all over New South Wales, and so costs
Id. only, while its Melbourne and Adelaide
and Brisbane rivals, which would otherwise
cut heavily into its business in the border
districts, pay ijd. postage, and consequently
cost l|d. And whether the New South
Wales free postage is abolished under Fede-
ration or is extended all over Australia, the
Telegraph will have to compete with its
Melbourne and Adelaide and Brisbane rivals
on even terms—they will all pay, or else all
go free—and the Freetrade organ will lose
its 50 per cent. Protection). As people with
such motives as these would gain very little
except ridicule by avowing them in all their
naked meanness, they all proclaim themselves
federalists who yearn after union with a
great yearning, and only object to the pre-
sent Bill because of its many awful defects.
And, as these defects are not there, they
have to invent them. And their 16 princi-
pal inventions are these :

There are four provinces (New South Wales Queens-

sign of weak intellect as well. y 1 a

That the Federal Bill was stealthily and
surreptitiously drafted by a “Secret Con-
ference.”
F £ d ? ral 0 11 r is the only Bin ever submitted to New
South Wales Parliament which was not a Secret Con-
ference Bill. Other Bills are drafted at a Secret Con-
ference of the Cabinet, and not even the most shameless
liar among the ant.i-Federal organs ever found that there
was anything wrong with the principle. This one was
prepared by a public conference, and only had one or two
small alterations made upon it afterwards at a private
meeting of Premiers. F
That the other provinces have laid a gra-
tuitous insult on Sydney by requiring that
the capital shall not be within 100 miles of
that city.
rr, B wu Houses of New South Wales Parliament demanded
that the capital should be in New South Wales—in other
words, that it should be not less than 75 miles from
Brisbane, 160 from Melbourne and Adelaide, 400 from
Hobart, or 1500 from Perth. If it is an “insult” to
stipulate that the Federal city must not be within a cer-
tain distance of an existing State capital, then the people
and Parliament of New South Wales are about the most
insulting crowd on this earth.
That the fact of the Federal capital not being
in Sydney will be the “ death-warrant ” of
that city (vide J. Want’s cablegram).
As all the provinces will be under the same tariff and
the same conditions (except that New South Wales will
have the cap it a l), this implies one of two things : Either
death-warrants of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne,
Hobart, Adelaide, and Perth are all signed at once, and
they are all going to be destroyed, only the destruction
o r' bve doesn’t matter-also, the New South
Wales Parliament deliberately plotted to destroy the
° th ° r capitals by insisting that none of them should
he the Federal city ; or else the Sydney people are such a
poor, mean, ignorant, cowardly, and unenterprising
crowd that they can t survive under conditions which
the vigorous and courageous people of the other cities
can face without alarm. Also, it implies that Sydney’s
death-warrant has been signed all through the last 100
years, when it wasn’t the Commonwealth capital, because
there was no Commonwealth.
* * * *
That New South VV ales is the only province
whose revenue, is improving, all the others
being in a decline, and therefore New South
Wales will have to support these “ neces-
sitous ” neighbors.
The financial situation of the six provinces for the last
three years has been as follows (Coghlan’s “Statistics of
the Seven Colonies of Australasia ”) :

1896-7 1897—8 1898-9 as

The figures demonstrate that New South Wales, in the
past three years, has shown less increase of revenue than
Queensland, Westralia or Victoria, and far less in pro-
portion to population than any other province. There-
fore, when the anti-Federal party states that New South
Wales will have to help the other provinces because it- is
the only one that has an improving revenue, and that the
other provinces want to federate with New South Wales
because in their declining state their only hope lies in
getting assistance from it, and talks of them as bein"
any more “insolvent” and “necessitous” than New
South Wales, it is lying—as usual.
* * * *
That the Braddon Clause commits the
Commonwealth to the imposition of a heavy
tariffalso, that it will make it necessary
for the Commonwealth to raise four times as
much revenue as it requires.
The Braddon clause provides that, so long as the debts
are left in the hands of the States, three-fourths of each
State’s customs and excise revenue (if there is any) will
be reserved to pay interest with (the customs and excise
being the source which they all depend on to pay in-
terest). When the State debts are taken over by the
Commonwealth the three-fourths will be used by the
Commonwealth to pay the interest with. It is purely a
provision for securing the public creditor either way. The
Commonwealth may decide to pay its own expenses out of
direct taxation, if it likes, and have no customs and excise •
or to depend partly on direct taxation and have a low re-’
venue-tariff like New South Wales’s ; or to have a high
tariff—the Braddon clause only provides that if
a tariff, large, small, or middle-sized, Foreign-trade, Pro-
tectionist, or otherwise, three-fourths of the proceeds
must be ear-marked as a very inadequate provision for
interest on the public debt. At present all the customs
and excise revenue of New South Wales and South
Australia doesn’t nearly meet the interest bill, and prac-
tically all that of Queensland and Tasmania goes in in-
terest, so, vvhether the clause is left in or not, the country
must set aside more than three-fourths of the proceeds of
its tariff for interest—or else repudiate its debt and go
broke. The party that is against the Braddon clause
is the Debt Repudiation Party, and its complaint is
that the Federal Government will have to raise four
times more customs revenue than it would require- that
is to say, four times more than it would require if it let
the country's interest bill remain unpaid.
That New South Wales is the only province
with any reserve-power of taxation, and con-
sequently must bear the greatest part of any
new financial burdens.
Westralia has no land-tax, income-tax, probate-duty,
excise, inland newspaper postage, or bank-note tax.
Queensland has no land or income tax. Victoria has no
land-tax except on estates over 640 acres in area and
£2600 in value, and it charges only half Now South Wales’
receipt-stamp duty. Tasmania has a land-tax of only id.
in the P, which can be doubled without exceeding the
New South Wales figure; and it has had, for the last
three years, the biggest surplus, in proportion to popula-
tion, in Australia, therefore it has the largest margin of
spare revenue. The legend about none of the pro-
vinces except New South Wales having any margin of
taxation to fall back upon, so that their share of any
Federal burdens must be borne by New South Wales, is
the usual Ananias.
* * * *
That “ the implements and tools, as well as
the imported material, of almost every trade
would, in this colony (N.S.W.), be taxed to an
enormous degree in excess of the charges
made upon them in the others.”— Daily
Telegraph lie , sth May, ’99.
The short answer to which childish bogey is that the
Federal Constitution declares, as distinctly as words can
put it, that all import and excise taxation shall be exactly
the same all over the Commonwealth.
That New South Wales, under a uniform
Federal tariff, will pay much more than its
neighbors.
The mode of reasoning, or of unreason, employed is this:
New South Wales, with a low tariff, imports heavily ;
Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia, with a high
tariff, import comparatively little. And if the New
South Wales tariff was raised to the Victorian
level, and if New South Wales still went on im-
porting as much under the high tariff as it did under the
low one, then it would pay more customs taxation per
head than its neighbors. But if the New South Wales
tariff was raised to the Victorian level, New South Wales
would import less, or if the Victorian tariff was reduced
to the New South Wales level, Victoria would import
more. The Dibbs-M‘Laurin Government proved the for-
mer proposition when it made its experiment with a
high tariff in New South Wales a few years ago, the cus-
toms taxation per head in three provinces being as
follows:
1890 1892 1894 1895
Low Tariff High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff
N.S.W. £1 13 7 £2 3 7 £1 12 6 £1 11 3
High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff High Tariff
Vic £2 6 3 £1 16 10 £1 10 3 £1 10 2
S.A. 232 1 16 11 1 10 1 191
When Australia is all under the same tariff New South
Wales, being accustomed to rely much on imports and
very little on local production, must inevitably pay more
customs taxation than some of the other provinces for the
first year or so. But when the province gets accustomed
to its new conditions it will pay no more than its next-
door neighbor. One more year of the Dibbs-M‘Laurin
tariff would almost certainly, considering the rate of
decrease, have reduced N.S. W.’s taxation below the Vic.
level.
* * * «
That the Bill ‘ ‘ gives the right to per-
petuate the Victorian bounties.”
The Bill provides that all bounties granted by New
South Wales, Victoria, or any other State previous to
30th June, 1898, shall hold good until the amounts al-
ready voted are used up. It will, probably, take at least
two or three years to get the Federal Government started,
and by that time almost every one of the Victorian
bounties will have expired, they being very few and for a
limited amount. New South Wales’s coal bounty, being
an indirect aid given by exempting the coal industry from
certain local taxes, will, apparently, go right on—not
that it matters much. All future bounties are in the
hands of the Federal Parliament, except that every State
has an equal right to grant aids to promote mining for
metals. On which point New South Wales, having a
much more varied supply of metals than its southern
neighbors, s'eemstocome off quite as well as Victoria, and
vastly better than S. A. But however that may be, one
province’s bounties will be just as much “ perpetuated ”
as another’s.
That Federation will cost New South Wales
225. 6d. per inhabitant per annum in extra
customs and excise taxation,
New South Wales last year, before the increase of cus-
toms duties, paid £1 3s. Id. per head in customs and
excise; South Australia paid £ll3s. sd. ; Victoria, £llss.
lid. If the rates are levelled up to the Victorian figure,
which is a mere matter of conjecture, the increase at
most will be 12s. lOd. The other 9s. Bd. is the usual lie.
And New South Wales will get the money back to build
its public works with, and to square its accounts, and to
pay off its deficit, and start an old-age pension system.
That the Federal capital will be in Mel-
bourne :
The Bill distinctly enacts that it will be in New South
Wales at all events, and it can’t do more than that.
* * * *
That “ Our Rivers ” are going to be stolen
or embezzled or grabbed by other provinces
which will come along in the night, and each
take a river under its arm, and sneak away.
“Our Rivers” are mainly' the Darling, whose waters
are largely supplied from Queensland, and the Murray,
which derives half its waters from Victoria. The only
mention of them in the Federal Constitution is this
(clause 99): “The Commonwealth shall not, by any law
or regulation . . . abridge the right of a State or of the
residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of
rivers for conservation or irrigation.” Even the most
agile liars on the river question never quote that clause,
but simply state off-hand that the rivers are going to be
run away with.
That “our trade” will be annexed by the
adjacent provinces.
The Federal Constitution provides for Freetrade inside
Australia. It abolishes the border duties by which
Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Tasmania shut
out New South Wales products; abolishes the heavy
Queensland and Tasmanian duties on New' South Wales
coal, and the export W'ool duty by which Queensland pre-
vents its wool going to New South Wales ports. It also
abolishes the differential railway rates by which so much
of New' South Wales’s wool trade is attracted to Melbourne
when it wmuld otherwise come Sydneywards. It puts
all the provinces on the same level, and if New South
Wales trade is such a poor, weak, diseased thing that it
can’t stand free and fair competition with its neighbors
then the wretched object deserves to be lost.
That the equal State represention in the
Senate is ruinous, unprecedented and gener-
ally awful.
There are 16 Federations now existing, and 14 of them
(including Switzerland, the oldest and most successful of
the crowd) have equal State representation in the Upper
House, regardless of population. And the great inevit-
able smash that is to come never happens.
That “ the Bill gives the Senate the right to
refuse supply until it gains its own ends,
while the Federal Government can only
control the House of Representatives.”—
Daily Telegraph lie, 9th May , 1899.
If the Senate refuses supply to “gain its own ends,”
there will be a deadlock. The remedy provided for a
deadlock is a joint sitting of the tw'o Houses, where the
majority decides. The House of Representatives, being
twice as large as the Senate, can control it every time.
And the Federal Government will control the House of
Representatives. So the above is the same old lie once
more.
That it will “prevent reform of any kind
desired in N.S.W. and Victoria by putting
a veto power in the hands of the three
smaller States.”
Instead of the three smaller States (South Australia,
Tasmania and West Australia) being able to veto New'
South VVales and Victoria the four small States,(South
Australia, Tasmania, West Australia and Queensland)
can’t do it. Whore any deadlock arises between the
Representatives, where New South Wales and Victoria
hold the majority, and the Senate, where the four small
States have the majority, the final decision rests with the
two Houses sitting- and voting as one. In that joint
House the voting- power will be :
Lower House Senatorial
Votes. Votes. Total.
New South Wales... 25 . ... 6 ... 31
Victoria 22 ... 6 ... 28
Queensland 9 ... 6 ... 15
South Australia ... 7 ... 6 ... 13
Tasmania 5 ... 6 ... 11
West Australia ... 5 ... 6 ... n
Majority of nine for New South Wales and Victoria over
the four small States. Fine robust lie.
A large number of other lies are held over
through want of space. In particular, the
great Twenty-two-shillings-and-,sixpence lie
requires an article to itself.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Shocking’ the Bishop.
Bishop Goe and the purist section of Melb.
University Council are in favor of a new statute
(which, however, the Senate is not anxious to
adopt) giving an absolute majority of the Coun-
cil power to wipe out any professor who may
from this time forward chance to be guilty, in
their opinion, of publishing questionable verses,
or uttering ungodly remarks, in any public or
private capacity whatsoever. The suggested
wording of the statute says, “ Guilty of any
conduct, whether or not in the course of his
duties, calculated to injure the University,”
and this, of course, includes the lamentable
possibility of a professor getting very much and
very drunk, or being detected in a criminal
act; but the main purpose of Bishop Goe and
his disciples is to obtain a means of dismissing
any future Marshall-Hall. The learned and
gifted Prof, in question had openly expressed a
disrespect for parsons and parsonic rules of
propriety : he has likened the pale moon, peep-
ing from behind a cloud, to a giddy maiden
with indiscreet intentions, and, in a general
way of speaking, he has shocked Bishop Goe.
And to shock a Bishop, whilst one is connected
with a University, is to imperil the morals
of the rising generation, in a churchy
way of speaking. The Council being
expected to safeguard the morals of Uni-
versity students, it follows that any Pro-
essor who might appear a dangerous person in
he Bishop’s eyes would probably have to go
forth from his billet by virtue of the new
statute. The Council is bound to swear, more
or less, by the morality of the spiritual poten-
tate in garters, so the statute would be an
awful stumbling-block in the path of worldly
Profs. If the Bishop were to catch one of
them saying “ damn ! ” or doing aught in the
nature of a bad example to the young (even
though there are no young present, save a con-
traband Tottie), the offence might prove fatal
to the sinner. Therefore, the less strictly
Grundyish section of the Council, headed by
Chancellor Judge Madden, is unfavorable to
the arbitrary statute aforesaid, and the Pro-
fessors are not likely to be exposed to the
risk of sudden dismissal on a charge of “insult-
ing behavior” towards the Church party. A
Professorial outrage against decency would find
the whole Council unanimous in making the
offender’s chair too hot to hold him; but an
outrage is one thing, and the shocking of a
narrow-minded Goe is another.

The Newcastle Coal Bogey.
More financial items from that wonderful
fount of inaccuracy, the Secret Conference Tele-
graph
The Victorian Government gives a bonus of a farthing'
a ton per mile on all Victorian coal carried on its rail-
ways. The Railway Commissioners make a further re-
duction of a farthing per ton per mile for such coal.
These concessions, which can be perpetuated under
the Secret Conference Bill, are part of what Newcastle
is asked to contend against.
And they are not all.
This question has been addressed to the Anti-Conven-
tion Bill League:—“The wharfage rates at Melbourne
are 4s. 6d. per ton, at Sydney Is. 6d. per ton, at New-
castle nil. Will Melbourne have to be levelled down or
Sydney up, and how will any levelling process affect
N.S.W. interests ? ”
What guarantee is there that N.S. W. rates will not be
levelled up and Newcastle thus put at great disad-
vantage ?
Again, the possibilities of exportation will be reduced
as a consequence of the limitation, by a high tariff, of
imports.
If the miners of Newcastle want to look after their own
interests they will VOTE TO A MAN AGAINST THE
BILL. It will have A DECIDEDLY DETRIMENTAL
EFFECT ON OUR COAL TRADE, for the simple reason
that the 27 per cent, advalorem duty essential to provide
for the necessities of the other colonies would mean that
very much less goods will be imported from England and
the Continent to Australia, and FEWER SHIPS would
consequently COME HERE for our coal. The OTHER
COLONIES HAVE ALL TO GAIN AND NOTHING TO
LOSE. They can still pour their grain and cabbages into
New South Wales, but will not require any more coal to
supply their wants.
Wherein the Secret - Conference Telegraph
blights its alleged immortal soul with another
untruth, for the Vic. Railway Commissioners
don’t make -a further reduction of a Jd. per ton
per mile. It is only one farthing all the time.
The case is a very simple one, and can be con-
densed into these few propositions
(1) In N.S.W. and Victoria local coal is carried by rail at
the same charge—Jd. per ton per mile. Some people say
that the rate doesn’t pay and that the charge should be
Jd., others say it is all right. Anyhow, the loss, if any,
is borne in Victoria by the general revenue, which pays to
the railway revenue the amount of the presumed deficit.
In N.S.W. the loss, if any, is borne by the railway revenue.
But. local coal is carried at the same rate in each province.
(2) But N.S. W. coal carried by rail in Victoria pays fd.
per ton per mile. This heavy tax will probably continue
or may even increase if the provinces don’t federate. If
they do, the clause prohibiting differential railway rates
will wipe it out and give N.S.W. coal the same show as
the Victorian artiele.
(3) The N.S.W. coal-owner receives a special bonus
(Is. (id. per ton according to the Telegraph) in the shape
of exemption from wharfage dues.
(4) The Telegraph pleads (a) that the N.S.W. coal-
miner shouldn’t federate because, as it alleges, the rail-
way charges are lower in Victoria, and ( b) that he
shouldn’t federate because the wharfage charges are
lower in N.S.W. In other words the bonus which the
Vic. Government gives is a reason against Federation
because bonuses are bad; and the bonus which N.S.W.
Government gives is a reason against it also, because
bonuses are too good to be lost.
(5) The Federal Government isn’t likely to interfere
with the N.S.W. wharfage-duties in any case. Wharfage-
rates aren’t even mentioned among the things over which
the Federal Government has cognisance.
(6) And, apropos of the grain and cabbage argument, if
N.S.W. can’t compete, under interprovincial freetrade,
with the other provinces in the matter of grain and cab-
bages, what’s the matter with the miserable place ? The
Bulletin always regarded N.S.W. as a province that
could grow grain and cabbages against anybody.
In any case, the N.S.W. coal-miner is the one


man in the community who wants Federation
at any price. Queensland and Tasmania have
already practically closed their doors to him by
imposing duties of 2s. and 3s. a ton, and only
Federation can compel them to take these
duties off. Now he almost depends for his
existence on the export - trade to V ic-
toria, S.A., and Westralia (Victoria alone
takes a quarter of his exports), and if Vic. and
Westralia put on a heavy duty in order to
develop their own coal-fields, of which they
have abundance, the N.S.W. miner had better
light out for the Benevolent Asylum. And the
only thing which can make it impossible for
them to put on that duty, and which can
make Victoria abolish its extra railway
charge on N.S.W. coal, is Federation and
its inevitable accompaniment, interprovincial
Freetrade. The N.S.W. coal-miner who votes
against Federation is voting to cut his own
throat. And, if he can’t see which way his in-
terests lie, his throat deserves the worst that
can happen to it.
The Auckland Lie.
The “ Auckland lie ” of N.S.W. anti-Federal
party grows monotonous. As a sample, one
“E. Guille” (why two “l’s”?) shrieks in
Sydney Telegraph :
The loss ot the capital is nothing, say these secret con-
spirators. Voters, you know better! Auckland was once
the capital of New Zealand ; influence and chicanery
removed it to Wellington. Auckland was taxed to build
Wellington’s harbor. Trade followed the capital. WHERE
(this in a deafening roar) IS AUCKLAND NOW ?
And every statement in this yarn, save one—
that the capital was removed —is absolutely
false :
(1) Auckland, like Sydney, is at the extreme edge of
the province. Maoriland, when its union was effected,
decided to have a more central capital. (2) The
selection of the capital was referred to a committee
selected from outside the province, so as to shut out all
chance of local influence and “chicanery.” It selected
Wellington as the most central city. Wellington had
mighty little “ influence ” in those days. (3) Auckland
wasn’t taxed to build Wellington’s harbor. Wellington has
a splendid natural harbor which didn’t require building.
The harbor works, wharves, etc., were charged to the
local harborboard, and Wellington pays theinterest on them
itself. (4) And as to where Auckland —ruinedAuckland —is
now : It is the most populous city in Maoriland (Auckland
and suburbs, 57,616 people ; Christchurch and suburbs,
51,330 ; Dunedin and suburbs, 47,280 ; Wellington—the
great bloated metropolis—and suburbs, only 41,758).
Also, Auckland is the greatest shipping port in Maori-
land. It owns three times as much shipping of its own
as Wellington. And, as a manufacturing province, Auck-
land is ahead of all others, save Canterbury, and far in
front of Wellington province. And the G. PiLE’s-dog party
assures us that what happened to Auckland will likewise
happen to Sydney. (5) Also, the whole parallel is a prevari-
cation. The Maoriland capital was removed from Auck-
land. The Australian capital won’t be removed from
Sydney, for it isn’t there. So Sydney should come off
better than Auckland that down-trodden ex-capital,
which has fallen up to be by far the biggest place in
Maoriland.

Some Agricultural Troubles.
“C.C.” about N.S.W. selectors’ wrongs :
Now that the squatters are beginning to wait on the
N.S.W. Lands Dept, door-mat for still another renewal of
their leases, let me point out to the Minister that by
granting these renewals for five years he plays into the
monopolist’s hands, and that he would be doing his
friends, the selectors, a favor by making the renewals ex-
tend a few days over five years. Reason why ? A clause
in the Land Act debars selector from claiming half cost
of boundary-fence from a lessee unless the lease has five
years to run. Thus lessee nearly always escapes by a
little dodgery. Have only known one selector who was
cute enough to score. Just before last renewal of the
Central leases he hurried up, got his boundary-fence on
the leasehold line finished, and lodged two claims for con-
tribution— one dated the day before, and one on the day
of renewal. Even then the lessee pleaded that as an
hour or two of his lease had expired before the claim was
made he was not liable 1 These fencing-regulations,
in fact, have been artfully framed by squatters for
squatters. A selector takes up land on a resumed area
and fences it. Yet the adjoining squatter pays nothing
towards the boundary-fence erected by the “ little man,”
whereas if there is already a fence there belonging to the
lessee the selector has to pay for the whole of it. The
squatter’s plea, that as his tenure is uncertain it wouldn’t
be fair to make him pay his share of the selector’s fence,
is mere bluff. With a Minister who will grant renewal
for the asking, the lessee has practical fixity of tenure,
and even if the lease is thrown open for selection the
lessee gets the value of his share of the fencing returned
him. Most selectors the writer knows repudiate the
eternal Parliamentary whine about the “ poor struggling
selectors.” They don’t claim more sympathy than any
other class of straggler, and only want their honest
grievances ventilated. They say: “Administer the Act
fairly, and don’t talk of charity !”
Another N.S.W. selector’s wail :
Dear B. —N.S.W. Lands Department is a persistent liar.
It has been frequently announced in the Sydney papers
that land-agents in drought-stricken districts have been
instructed not to insist upon fines for over-due payments,
yet the local land-agent says—“ All rot! I have no
orders from head-quarters to remit the fines, and people
will have to pay them if they are only a day over-due
with the cash.” The “struggling selector” is getting
very tired of being advertised as the recipient of con-
cessions he never gets. The squatter who owns scores of
selections is doubtless the poor “ straggler ” whose fines
are to be remitted. Again, there is a selector in this
district who was fined 10 per cent, for not paying his rent,
when it was due, and although he explained to the de-
partment that he didn’t pay because the land-agent-
wouldn’t talce the rent—pending an appeal for reduction
—his fine was not remitted. The present Act may be the
best up to date, but the administration of the depart-
ment is hopelessly rotten, and will remain so as long as
the head of it continues to be a man who has no practical
knowledge of the subject.
“ Moldoon ” upon a sore subject :
N.S.W. Stock Department plays a good second to its
brother ass, the Lands. Present assessment under
Diseases in Sheep Act is Bs. per 1000. Owners up to 500
exempt, but oyer that number and under 1000, full rate.
Thus a man with 500 sheep pays nothing, but the owner
of 1001 pays Bs. for the 1000 and Bs. for the odd sheep !
Of course he only pays theoretically. As a matter of
fact, the owner who has an odd hundred or two easily
convinces himself that they will die before his assessment
is due, and soothes his conscience wdth the reflection that
all the thousands of pounds collected under the Act are
expended upon alleged inspectors who only heard of
sheep dying of anthrax on the public roads when the
newspapers reported that the drovers who skinned them
had also died. Stated at the same time in press that the
Department had collected £28,000, the whole of which
went in salaries. If the assessment-returns were correct
they would have a few thousands more to play with, but
at present the sheep statistics are even less reliable than
the figures of the Sunday Shellback when it’s enlarging
Braddon’s Blot with an inky finger. There is a peculiar
oversight in the working of the D. in S. Act which allows
of thousands of sheep escaping the assessment; but, as I
share the general opinion of stock-owners that the Act is
as obsolete as N.S.W’. Marine Board, and the money
simply wasted, I don’t intend publicly to put my finger
on the weak spot, though I am willing- privately to con-
vince The Bulletin. Anybody acquainted with the
idiotic working of our Stock Acts and Land Acts must
regret that Australians don’t follow the English fashion of
putting the “ fool of the family ” into the Church instead
of getting him a Government billet.
The Federal Senate Bogey.
The lament of Holman, M.L.A., as reported
in the daily press :
The Federal Senate, which practically ruled the
finances, and could veto legislation, was essentially con-
fined to men who could spend some
expenses to canvass the , consist of property
electorate. Thus t | ie nmresenting ft minority,
representatives, and, althoug 1 n| nlr tLnnrap as in
would be the dominant House controlling thepuise,
Just so. And, of course, it is quite impossible
for the Federal Parliament to pass a law, as
has been already done in at ieast one Australian
province, to limit the amount to be spent on
election it? And tl,e men who
does the most canvassing always gets in
doesn’t he? And seeing that more than half
the population of N.S.W. is included in four
out of the 141 counties, it is, of course, still
necessary to stump the other 137—there bemg
unfortunately no newspapers in JN.b. W., a
man has to address the whole country per-
sonally ! And the fact that half the population
of Victoria is compressed into three cities
makes it absolutely necessary to stump
that province front end to end also . All
the largest constituencies are represented
by wealthy men—hence the enormously rich
Millen long represented the biggest one in
N.S.W., and ex-working-miner Ferguson now
represents the second biggest, and the fourth
biggest is represented by that stupendous
capitalist, ex-working miner Sleath ! 1 Also,
the provinces were one constituency at the
Federal Convention election hence such
wealthy men as Lyne, bootmaker Trenwith,
Graham Berry (poor old Berry, dependent
for his daily bread on a small State pension)
were there as a matter of course ! What is
politician Holman giving us ? Why, he him-
self, though he hasn’t been a year in Parliament,
and is not supposed to be a millionaire, would
already have a very excellent chance (provided
he doesn’t spoil it by continuing to talk non-
sense) of being elected to the Federal Assembly.
Some Sabbath. Paper Tips.
The Sunday Shellback again, quoting from
Dr. M'Laurin :
Supposing', for example, that the Federal Treasurer
were to keep the customs and excise revenue, all the
States would be left with serious deficiencies, which
would prevent them from meeting their engagements, and,
in fact, would prevent them from paying the interest on
their debts.
Now, this persistent and brassy person knows
perfectly well that the much-abused Braddon
clause provides for 15s. out of every 20s.
raised by customs being either returned to
the States so that they may pay the interest
on their debts, or applied by the Common-
wealth to pay the interest on these same debts.
And M’Laurin is never tired of demanding the
abolition of this arrangement. And the same
M’Laurin admits that if this arrangement is
abolished the States must default. So the Debt
Repudiation party again comes to the front,
and M’Laurin is its prophet:
During the Secret Conference of the Premiers in Mel-
bourne, the other day, they passed a new clause, which
entitled the Federal Government to give assistance to
the weaker States. That is a very fine clause.
Dr. MacLaitrin advocates Unification, and
under Unification such a clause would
be unnecessary, because by virtue of the
Unification N.S.W. and all the other pro-
vinces would go bail for the solvency of
every province and county in the continent,
just as Sydney at present time is security
for every shilling of the interest of the
money spent on the Bogan bridge at Monkey.
Under Federation it is quite proper that such
a clause should be in the Constitution, as the
Commonwealth can borrow money for the relief
of any “necessitous State” at a much lower
rate of interest than the n.s. itself ; and, of
course, the “ necessitous ” one would have to
pay the interest thereon. Seeing that Dr. Mac-
Laurin himself declares that the N.S.W.
“ surplus ” can’t be annexed to help the “ neces-
sitous State,” what has N.S.W. to complain of ?
N.S.W. Provincialist party has one long howl
that will not be quieted: “The necessitous
States will rob rich N.S.W.” To Dr. Mac-
Laurin’s credit be it said, he, at least, knocked
that idea to pieces, and declared emphatically
that under the Constitution Bill it could not be
done. At the Protestant Hall the black-labor
director said:
But where is the Federal Treasurer to get the money
(with which to assist the necessitous States)? Is he to
take it out of the N.S. Wales surplus? . . . The
fact is that the Federal Treasurer cannot take it out
of the surplus, because that is the property of this
country, and he could be stopped by the Supreme
Court. He cannot get it out of N.S.W., except by an act
of robbery, and I do not wish to accuse the other colonies
of robbery. I never did, and I will not do so now. All I
say is, he cannot get it out of the N.S.W. surplus.
The parochial party is never weary of holding
up MacLaurin as the most reliable Federal
authority in Australia. And the reliable
MacLaurin thus knocks the parochial party’s
best argument endways.
More Sunday Shellback :
SOOLING ON THE POLICE.
MUZZLING COGHLAN.
DEPRIVING CIVIL-SERVANTS OF CITIZEN RIGHTS.
These are some of the means adopted by the anxious
pro-Bill leaders to try and force the Bill on the people.
According to pro-Billites, the man who wants to
thoroughly examine the terms of the contract he is de-
sired to become a party to is nothing less than a scoun-
drel.
It is indeed astonishing how examination of the facts is
resented. The people are supposed to go like dumb,
driven cattle to the slaughter—all because" of the office-
hunger of certain individuals.
This is simply lovely. At Sydney Town Hall
some thousands of people were gathered
together to hear Reid and Barton explain
“ the terms of contract,” and a few dozen
howling ruffians, apparently paid by the Pro-
vincialist party, resented it so loudly, and
cursed and broke chairs so furiously, that most
of the thousands heard not one word of the
“terms of contract,” and their attempt to
examine the Bill was utterly wrecked. This
certainly looked as if it was the Provincialist
party that resented examination. The attempt
to remove these roaring rowdies is what the
Sunday rag calls “ sooling on the police,” the
Sabbath Shellback being the standing apolo-
gist for disorder and the sworn enemy of free-
dom of speech (the other fellow’s freedom of
speech). As to what “ depriving civil servants
of citizen rights ” means Heaven only knows.
They have the franchise. They are not allowed
to address public meetings either for or against
the Bill, but it is years since they were deprived
of that right, and the Sabbath tipster never
seriously objected when they lost it. But this
world is full of woe and confusion, and of
Sunday papers that urge the public to buy
shares in the excellent Shellback mine just
before it goes utterly broke, and there are
many things in it that are hard to understand.
Three Provincial Items.
Some slabs from Dr. M'Laurin, M.L.C.
The railways are a paying asset in this oolony (N.S.W.)
You will riot have the privilege (under Federation) of
sending your letters for a penny, as you do now.
The Bill provides for a system of bounties by which the
producer in Victoria will be put in a much more favorable
position than the producer in N.S.W.
The shortest reply to which is that not one of
these statements has a shadow of truth about
it. The Bill gives every province exactly the
same privileges in the matter of bounties. As
there are four provinces which have penny
town-postage, against two that haven’t, the
chances are 100 to 1 that the postage argument
will turn out a shameless lie. And the N.S.W.
railways, according to the latest published re-
port of the Auditor-General, are not a paying
asset, and never have been. They are nearer to
it than most of the others, but there is no
paying railway-system in the Seven Provinces,
barring Westralia’s, which is now fast getting
back to its old, non-profitable state. Will the
just and fair-minded and honorable gentlemen
of anti-Bill please try to tell the exact facts—
well, say, semi-occasional ly ?
+.
“ The Bulletin’s ” Prize Competition.
This paper is not generally addicted to prize-
competitions, but it is moved to start one by
the following statements cut from the Secret Con-
ference Telegraph’s regular anti-Federal lead-
ing article of 9th May :
One of the most misleading contentions used by its
advocates in seeking to secure for the Secret Conference
Bill the support of the wage-earners of N.S. Wales is that
a great deal of employment would be assured to them by
the building of the Federal capital. ... If the proposed
Bill finds acceptance, it is a very open question whether
the plans for a Federal capital in N.S. Wales will
ever be drawn. But assuming the improbable con-
tingency that the removal of the seat of Aus-
tralian Government from Melbourne during the present
generation is decided upon, what prospect is there that the
workers of N.S.W. will he thereby afforded, an especial
opportunity of obtaining employment ? Even if the site
decided upon were in the remotest part of our north-
western territory, there would be no bar to the workers of
other colonies reaching it and becoming applicants for em-
ployment equally with those of Sydney, save the cost of
an inexpensive sea passage. To come from Melbourne
to Sydney is a small matter to those who think that by
doing so employment could be secured. It was bitterly
complained of in Melbourne, when large contracts like
that of the erection of the Exhibition Building were in
progress, that a considerable number of N.S.W. workmen
were employed.
There is a slight difference here—not that that
matters much. Victoria paid the whole cost of
its Exhibition, and, despite its Protectionist
ideas, N.S.W. workmen—a considerable num-
ber of them—were allowed to find employment
and wages at the erection of that stupend-
ous soap-and-candle show. The Victorian
workmen grumbled certainly, but still the
Cornstalk crowd had the employment. N.S.W.
claims to practise the large, wide virtue of
Freetrade, and not to be narrow-minded like
the Protectionists of Melbourne. It won’t pay
the whole cost of building the Federal capital,
but only a shade over one-third of it, for all the
provinces will contribute. And the Freetrade
Telegraph has the inconceivable dog-mean-
ness to urge, as a reason why N.S.W. should
reject Federation, the absence of any provision
in the Bill to the effect that, while Queensland,
Victoria, Tasmania, S.A. and Westralia contri-
bute nearly two-thirds of the cost of building
the Federal city, no workmen from these pro-
vinces shall get a job at its construction. The
idea of the truthful, honest, fair-minded
gentlemen who run the Telegraph is that
N.S.W". should supply a little over one-third
of the money, and all the wages should be dis-
tributed among Sydney workmen—even N.S. W T .
workmen from places outside Sydney seem to be
barred ; while the other provinces should put up
the bulk of the cash and their people should be
warned off as lepers so far as the employment
and wages are concerned. And yet the I).T.
admits that the Victorian people, against whom
it rails so unceasingly, didn’t treat N.S.W. like
that when they had work to distribute, though
it was work for which Victoria paid the entire
bill. The Telegraph started as an advocate
of unity by demanding that all the other pro-
vinces should be regarded as politically-in-
fected spots and disqualified so far as the pos-
session of the Federal capital is concerned, but
its latest idea breaks even its own particularly
villainous record all to pieces. Wherefore The
Bulletin, as already mentioned, has been
moved to start a prize competition. After con-
sidering the length and breadth and depth and
general hoggishness of the D.T.’s latest
provincial argument, it proposes to offer a
prize to anyone who can find a provincial
argument which will be even meaner than the
one which the D.T. gentlemen have evolved.
It wants to preserve that argument as a curio-
sity. Said prize will cousist of a life-size por-
trait of a worm crawling on an ash-heap, and
will be enclosed in a wooden frame. All mean
men are cordially invited to compete, but no
prize will be awarded unless some one submits
an even lower-down specimen than the one
quoted above. Competition closes on Referen-
dum Day, as after that date the market for
purely parochial meanness will undergo a
severe slump. The worm in the picture will
be the very large, bulgy kind that grows in
damp spots in tropical Australia, and the artist
doesn’t mind enlarging it a little “ on his own ”
if a peculiarly deserving competitor presents
himself.

Another Boiler.
The recent boiler explosion at Sheppar-
ton, Victoria (two deaths, some children
scalded, girl injured, one store and one hotel
wrecked, town considerably battered, some
persons and other ■ animals scared out of their
wits, cash damage about £2000) should make
the Turner Govt, put on a spurt with the
Boilers Inspection Bill promised for next ses-
sion. As for the reason of the catastrophe, it
is the old story over again :
The owner states that the boiler was second-hand when
put in the works at the time they were built, and how old
it is cannot be conjectured. He had anticipated no dan-
ger from it.
The owner never does, somehow. His late
lamented boiler, according to the Age account
quoted above, was so venerable that the exact
extent of its venerableness was beyond the
reach of conjecture, and even an owner knows
that boilers are not immortal. But it is a great
deal cheaper, for a time at least, to have perfect
confidence in the old boiler than to buy a new
one, and the owner goes right on having confi-
dence to the bitter end.
Those who predicted* and those others who
prayed that, with the withdrawal of the anti-
ivingstoman doctors from Adelaide Hospital
ttie poor patients ” would soon crowd out the
new cemetery, have been shockingly disap-
pointed; and successive annual reports have
knocked out the rebellious doctors’ allegedly
humanitarian idea of running a rival institution
on their own. Very opportunely on the eve of
general Parliamentary election, when
Premier Kingston almost for the first time
appeared to be seriously in danger, the hospi-
tal board’s ’9B report was issued. No docu-
ment could more thoroughly prove the wisdom
of a bit of administi auun as bold and deter-
mined as any Australia has known. First of
all, the hospital is shown to be as popular
among patients as ever. In 1888 there were
2003 cases; in ’97, 2740; in ’9B no less than
3246. Next, patients had to remain a shorter
average time—the average for ’9B is the
lowest since ’Bl. The rate of mortality was
7-11 per cent.—against 9'B in ’95, 9'2 in ’96,
and 7'59 in ’97. A particular mess was going
to be made of surgical cases; to go to the
operating-table under the new' regimd was to be
much the same as going to the morgue. Yet,
as a matter of fact, in respect of 1332 patients
operated on, the rate of mortality was ‘9 per
cent., while the mortality ascribed to the
operations themselves was '4 per cent. —one in
250. The silence with which Kingston’s
enemies have read the report has been one of
the most eloquent things of the Parliamentary
election campaign.
+
Gov. Beauchamp, who comes to the head of
N.S.W. affairs with a little munioipal but no
really political past, is received w'ith open arms
by many of the very men pledged by their votes
in Parliament to resist such a Governor. When
policeman Henry Blake darkened the Queens-
land horizon, N.S.W. took up the question of
what sort of man her own Governor should be,
and Parkes moved an address to the Queen, of
which the following is an extract:—
In view of the great and growing interests of this
colony in connection with the Empire, we desire dutifully
to convey to your Majesty the expression of our opinion
that no person in the future should be appointed to the
office of Governor who has not had experience in the
conduct of public affairs in high political office, or in the
Imperial Parliament.
Dibbs, leader of the Opposition, supported the
motion, Wise supported it, Reid voted for it,
half the men now prominent in Parliament
voted for it. Buchanan and Tommy Walker
created a diversion because they objected to an
imported Governor of any sort, but the motion
was ultimately unanimously agreed to. Yet
here comes Beauchamp into the open arms of
all these people, as if he were the ideal after
which the nation strained.
The complaint about the alleged “ muzzling ”
of N.S.W. Statistician Coghlan with which
the parochial party is now rending the heavens,
is interesting when all the circumstances are
considered :
(1) The anti-Federal party declares that this is the
same obnoxious Bill as the one of last year.
(2) Coghlan reviewed that Bill at great length, and if it
is the same Bill as alleged, and Coghlan’s last year’s
statements were accurate as alleged, then it doesn’t
require further reviewing.
(3) The muzzle yarn is utterly false on the face of it.
The anti-Federal party, which has the gall of many thou-
sand cuttle-fish, asked that a public servant, paid by the
public, should be lent to them to dig up information
about the Bill, of which information they' would pre-
sumably suppress what didn’t suit them, and publish the
rest as an official utterance.
(4) They were told that the public servant in question
was not lendable to any clique of private persons, but
that he was as much at liberty to deal with the subject
now as he was last year—which apparently means that he
can talk or write in his spare time, like anybody else.
And this is how the N.S.W. Statistician was
“ muzzled.”
The survivors of Dr. Lang’s 1849 cargoes of
immigrants who settled down in Fortitude
Valley (Brisbane), gave a picnic, the other day,
to their friends by way of celebrating the
jubilee of their arrival. One of the doctor’s
old warriors numbers 130 descendants. Bris-
bane Courier revives proudly the memory of
the battle that Lang and his sturdj r friends
fought against the convict-transportation sys-
tem. Same Courier howls ferociously against
any modern revolutionist who ventures to
breathe a syllable against the iniquities of the
present kanaka system—a business quite as bad
and as black in its way as ever the old trans-
portation system was. The convicts, at all
events, didn’t spread leprosy among the free
population. Neither did they leave a hybrid
generation behind them to constitute a curse
and a social sore on the body of the coming
nation. But Lang can’t make things uncom-
fortable for Fat Men.any longer. He’s a Dead
Hero, and Dead Heroism can’t hit anybody in
the paunch.

“ A.8.C.” states in S.M. Herald some reasons
why the Federal Bill should be rejected by
the free and indigestible electors of N.S. W. :
1. Because under Federation farthing jumbles will only
be obtainable at the rate of three for the penny. Let the
State children pause and digest this fact (if they can
digest the jumble, why not the fact?), and before they
barter away their birthright, earned by so many slap-
pings, read an iniquitous Bill that would enslave them
for ever.
2. Because under the proposed scheme of Federation
every woman in this colony will be compelled to pay l£d.
a year extra for her imported fashion journals. Mothers,
think of this !
3. Because in order to die comfortably in N.S.W. every
person about to shuffle off will have to contribute to the
funeral expenses of dead persons in Victoria. Clause
3047 proves that every corpse in this colony will be taxed
for the support of three corpses in Tasmania. Will you
stand it ? Then rise from the Necropolis and reject this
Abortion at the polls.
4. The Bill is so drawn that it will promote pains in
the head, dizziness, chilblains, and a heavy feeling after
meals ; and all for the benefit of the other colonies.
5. Because under the rivers’ clauses it will be im-
possible for the citizens of Sydney to let the taps in their
back yards run all day, as every pint of water in this
continent will be required to make an ornamental lake in
Melbourne for the Federal legislators to row upon. House-
holders with fixed tubs should think over this.
5. Because the Bill makes flirting criminal, and punishes
sweep-promoters with death; it will confiscate your
money in the Savings Bank, and flood the colony witn
dervishes, rinderpest, German clocks, and other foreign
commodities. Eleotors, reject it.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty's “ The Belle of New York."
Criterion. “The Three Musketeers."
E-oyal. “ The Liars.”
yceum “ A Soldier and a Man."
Tivoli. Rickards Co.
Town Hall Newbury’s Shilling Pops.
Fitzgerald’s Circus—opposite Redfern Stai ion.
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess “Forty Thieves.”
Theatre Royal “ How London Lives.”
Bijou Rickards Variety Co.
St. George's Hall Dante the Great.
Alexandra “The Sixth Commandment."
The costly musical show at Her Majesty’s
has got safely into its second week, and the pro-
bability is that it will get into a good many more
weeks before it wears out its welcome. Some
night, of course, the last pair of legs will be turned
off at the meter ; and the young hero’s last drunk
will be blown out ; and the final girl of them
all will put her brief skirt outside the door to be
polished, and go to bed ; and the bottles that re-
main from Bronson’s revelry will be shifted in the
surreptitious ash-cart; but these things are not
yet. There is no vast boom over the “ Belle,”but
it appears to be making a good, steady living.
Yet it is the kind of play which makes this paper
feel worn and crow’s-feetty and wrinkled, and as
if it was a remnant coming home from an all-night
burst when it was too old for that kind of enjoy-
ment. The “Belle” is built upon the familiar
story of the Young Man and the Old Man and
the Girl. The Young Man is drunk when the
audience makes his acquaintance, yet he looks as
if he was prematurely world-weary and all
the joy had gone out of his drunk.
He and the other gilded youths present
a dissipated shirt-front to the cold grey dawn,
like ten slim dudes bowed down by a great
weight of dollars, and trying to re-light the ashes
of a lost youth that had gone out before its proper
season. The Old Man is a lean hypocrite, with a
mouth like a dry sepulchre full of snuffle, and a
desire to paw the nice girl. The girl who has been
divorced nine times looks handsome in a hard sort
°f fashion, but, after all, the joke about the lady
who, through much marriage and divorce, has
come to be a kind of public building, doesn’t
appeal to the tremendously high order of intellect
which has always been the leading feature of this
paper. And the Salvation girl only looks her best
m her Hallelujah bonnet and her blue costume.
When she gets into the short skirt and other
frivolities of the flesh a lot of the holy charm
leaves her.
* • * *
The present authority likes Oscar Girard,
the Old Man of the play, for his dry and never-
failing humor, and, for his sake, he hopes the
“Belle” will prosper. But when the author in-
vented the public building with the nine consecu-
tive husbands he made a mistake, though the lady
who struggles with the part isn’t responsible for
his blunder. The German lunatic who wants to
kill Bronson grows in favor to some extent on
account of the particularly contorted fit which he
takes when Bronson escapes him, and Charles
Ken'ningham and Miss Belle Bucklin have bright
moments wherever the nature of the show gives
them a chance. Likewise the profusion with
which the Firm has staged this unstable trifle
strikes one like all the N.S. W. public debt falling
on his head when it is least expected. And the
writer decides to suddenly stop here lest he be be-
guiled into saying something that may sound un-
friendly.

To-nighfc (Thursday) the “ Three Musket-
eers” are due at Sydney Criterion. The new
version is the work of Bernard Espinasse and
George Rignold, and rumor has it that they have
done something great and unusual with the tale of
the four tremendous adventurers who stood the
troubled kingdom of Louis the Just on its ear.
There is so much hard riding in the story, and it
covers so much space, and rages on so many towers
and battlements, and is so full of conspiracy and
entrenchments and sudden death, that all that can
be done is to select a few of the best corpses from
the heap.. It is alleged, however, that the authors
of the Criterion version have selected them on a
new principle, in consequence whereof their
particular heap of dead has all the advantage of
novelty.
** * *
“ Lady Ursula ” was put on for only a
fortnight at Sydney Royal, and “The Liars”
follows on Saturday. Therefore whosoever has
not yet seen Mrs. Brough’s graceful figure blush-
ing in male attire, especially when Joseph Carne
compliments her on her legs, had better seize an
opportunity which will last till Friday night only.
The spectacle in question is well worth the neces-
sary expenditure of anybody’s money. And there
is one moment of immense thrill in the play when
the disguised lady, being harassed by a crowd of
gay bachelors who want her to drink, and smoke,
and go to bed, and do other unseemly things,
rushes into a duel with one of her tormentors ancl
demands satisfaction with pistols across a table.
Things get so far that another half-second will
obviously lead to the destruction of the carpet by
the spreading thereon of a saucerful of grey brains,
and half the audience gets on its feet with tense
expectancy creeping, like a spider with cold feet,
up its spine. That thrill alone is worth 6d. extra.
* * * '*
Benjamin Landeck’s new play, “ A Soldier
and a Man,” will unfurl the gory banner of war
at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday. A new leading
lady, Miss Dora de Winton, from London, and Mr.
Charles Saunders, from the same obscure spot,
will make their first Australian appearance on this
occasion, and help the banner to unfurl for all it
is worth. Until then the admonitory tale of
whisky will continue to point a moral at the
Lyceum, and Mr. O’Neill will batter his dis-
tracted wife because she asks him to come back to
the ruined ’ome where the children have had
nothing to eat for years or thereabouts. After
a second inspection of the above episode the
battering of the thin, faded, little woman’s head
began to assert itself as a tolerably sickening spec-
tacle. The beery husband gets her in chancery,
and pounds her shrieking countenance till, in the
usual order of things, she shouldn’t have a single
feature left. The adventuress who has had vitriol
poured over her is also a gruesome spectacle when
she has recovered and is leading a crushed exist-
ence in a back room with red bars all over a
countenance that will never smile again. In fact,
there is rather too much realism in “ Man’s
Enemy.”

Attention is drawn in large type to the
ta.pt that Horace Wheatley is again at Sydney
Tivoli, likewise the eager, tearing little humorist,
Peggy Pryde, the gymnastic Keziahs, and Manuel
Godson, the streaky gentleman whose contortions
are awful to behold. The Royal Standard is again
open, this time with J. P. West, the one-time
Deacon of Maggie Moore’s co., in com-
mand.

Fitzgerald Brothers celebrated their eighth
week in Sydney with another change of pro-
gramme, which went off with the same happy fizz
and bang as its predecessors. Mahomet, the
“Talking Horse,” who must be getting rather an
aged horse now; Vita Provini, a remarkable
child juggler and balancer; the acrobatic Atlas
Brothers, and Rosina Aquinaldo, an alleged
Cuban lady contortionist, whose bonelessness is
calculated to haunt a man in his dreams, are the
principal new items. To-morrow (Friday) Tom
Tom, Fitzs’ clever clown, takes a benefit, in view
of his early departure for England. Thomas
Thomas is of English origin, and is going back to
stand on his comical head in the land where all
the happy recollections of his childhood are
centred.
At Sydney Opera House the “Two
Scamps ” have gone the way of all scamps and
been succeeded by “ The Alhambra Girl,” a three-
act musical farce, adorned with many morals. In
the course of this frantic upheaval, the respectable
household of Mr. Arthur Glover (Mr. W. J.
Montgomery), is. reduced to something between
sheol and a lunatic asylum by the arrival of the
Alhambra girl, a lurid Flossie in scarlet robes,
with Mr. Glover’s handkerchief. The complica-
tions are awful, and by the end of the second act
the master of the house has five women, including
the Flossie, fainting in his drawing-room all at
once. Miss Marion Lewis, as Sophie, here sings a
song of love and fidelity, and is usually called back
twice by an enthusiastic audience. The third act
is devoted to clearing things up, and local hits. A
topical song by Mr. T. E. Fisher, as Joshua Gilt-
edge, is usually good for several encores.
Mr. Arthur Denham, disguised as one Jobson,
also pleases the people by explaining that
his marred visage was due to the anger of his
beloved, the same lady who sings of love and
fidelity, and who has declared that she would fix
thereon the birth-marks Lord Beauchamp made
the borrowed poetry about. As the Alhambra
girl, Miss Phillips acts well enough, and her song,
“A Little Bit of String, ” is well done; but her
last vocal effort is reminiscent of the five pipers
who simultaneously played six different tunes in
the same wee parlor. If it be a success to amuse
the audience and make it enjoy its night out, the
“Alhambra Girl,” despite its wrecky condition
as a work of literature, is successful enough, in
spite of the fact that Miss Marion Medway, as the
Mother-in-law, is over-painted and over-drawls
her part. Miss K. Scott and Miss Hilda Fraser,
as Mrs. Glover and Lillie Sydney respectively, are
neat and look at home in their characters. It would
be an improvement if Mr. W. J. Montgomery spoke
louder and not quite so fast; but he looks such a
picture of despair that this scribe, who has been
m trouble over women all his life, feels quite a
brotherly love for him.
*# * *
At Melb. Princess’s to-day (Thursday)
there is to happen a “farewell complimentary
matinee, tendered to Mr. Julius Knight, by
Messrs. Williamson and Musgrove, at the close
of his long and memorable engagement in Aus-
tralia, extending over two years and three months.
The programme selected for the occasion will con-
sist of ‘ The Sign of the Cross, ’ in which Mr.
Knight will be seen for the last time as Marcus,
the character with which his name will be ever most
indelibly associated in this country.” The fore-
going quotation from the advt. may be taken as
the text for a bilious sermon on the great financial
success of the “ Knight-Ferrar co.” (now so-called)
and the origin thereof. Julius Knight, Miss Fer-
rar, Miss Page, Gaston Mervale, Hawtrey and
co., started their Australian campaign in Mel-
bourne with “The Prisoner of Zenda,” a deserving
play which undoubtedly showed all of them at
their best as actors. Knight, who made his first
appearance in a red-brown suit and an unbecom-
ing straw-hat, was neither glorified by Melbourne’s
womenfolk, nor held up to special adoration by
the management. He was accepted as a worthy
leading-man, with a presence somewhat more im-
portant and not visibly older than that of the J.K.
who played second-fiddle to Clifton Alderson at
the Royal in days of yore. The Firm didn’t
star ” Knight for the obvious reason that George
Coppin had not * 4 starred 99 him when he cam© hero
as a member of the Laura Villiers co.
* * * •
“ Prisoner of Zenda ” excited no
enthusiasm in Melbourne. The play was a
little too good, anyhow, for the average
theatre - going fool, whilst the critical people
couldn’t get away from the thought that Mrs.
Potter and Bellew would have been more
“romantic ” and picturesque than Julius and Miss
Ferrar in the two leading parts. “Prisoner of
Zenda” failing to boom, the Firm tried “Two
Little Vagabonds,” and here Miss Ferrar and
Julius Knight were at their worst as the lugu-
brious heavy parents of a long-lost child, the boy
Dick and his consumptive pal, Wally, being the
chief features of the show. Up to this time there
was no apparent probability of Julius Knight’s
engagement proving memorable. When he
passed on from Melbourne to Sydney his
departure was a merely casual event. When
he reappeared at the Princess’s he was Marcus
Superbus in that clap - trap, mock - religious
melodrama, “The Sign of the Cross.” Audio!
the women adored Marcus for his gaudy profli-
gacy, his fine bare arms and his impressive, padded
legs, and in his professional and social capacities
i which are_ practically one capacity for an actor)
iulius Knight stood about 15ft. higher than be-
fore. The lamentable “ Sign of the Cross ” made
a new man of J ulius Knight, and from that time
up to now Melbourne people in general have never
thought of the Julius who played the hero in a
first-class stage story 27 months ago, and seemed
hardly big enough for the part. He takes away
with him an Australian reputation, not earned by
the best work he has done here, but achieved
through the influence of his Roman legs. Nine-
teen women out of twenty consider that Mr.
Knight’s limbs were the two grandest bits of acting
they ever saw.
** * *
“ The Forty Thieves ” pantomime extrava-
fanza, which was a Xmas show in Sydney, will
e produced at the Princess’s on Saturday (20th)
with a slightly different cast. An imposing him-
perial tableau, entitled Britannia and Her Sons,
will be added for the first time to the original
spectacle, and the ballet will include sixty dear
little souls in raiment of surpassing beauty.
** * *
Bland Holt, at the Royal, has also ar-
ranged to put up a new attraction on Saturday,
when Australia will get its positively first experi-
ence of “ How London Lives.” We have
had dramas “Lost in London,” also “Lights
of London,” and “Alone in London,” and
we are acquainted with the girl who
escapes along a telegraph-wire “When London
Sleeps.” This time the metropolis is going to
disclose its latest modes of living, on a scale of
exceptional splendor and awfulness. Meanwhile,
“ Woman and Wine ” continues to supply a public
want, and the steeplechase grows reckless in its old
stage. Last Saturday, one of the rank outsiders
fed heavily. Likewise the jockey, who slips from
the “dead-bird’s ’’saddle, was so late in slipping
that he had to let himself drop with a bang. The
fury of Walter Baker and the surrounding punters
seemed selfish under the circumstances, for they
were not the only persons who suffered through
the jockey’s misconduct. He felt rather hurt him-
self.
** * *
The Bijou is full every night since Cin-
que valli began to roll his head around the cannon-
ball, consequently the festive little marvel presents
the samp list of juggles as in the beginning, and
keeps his changes of programme in reserve. But
he changes his silk fleshings and bodice several
times a week, and each suit looks more expensive
than the one he juggled in previously. The other
night Cinquevalli broke his artistic silence by
dropping a few words re an uproarious admirer in
one of the private boxes. As an apology for being
unable to perform the famous billiard-ball-balanc-
ing feat, he smiled sadly at the noisy stranger and
said, “ Sometimes the silliest little thing puts me
out.” Which was Cinquevallian.
** * *
Melb. Town Hall was almost crowded last
Saturday afternoon, when Marshall Hall shook
his baton at 55 instrumentalists and set them going
on Schubert’s melodious unfinished Symphony.
The programme was calculated to attract many
people, and it fetched them accordingly. Good
music, treated as Prof. Hall and co. treat it, will be
always well patronised if it is not a little too
good for this world. Weber’s “ Oberon ” overture,
“The Dowie Dens o’ Yarrow,” by Hamish
MacCunn, the Schubert work aforesaid, Mar-
shall-Hall’s “Study on Tennyson’s ‘Maud’”
(dramatically sung by Madame Wiedermann), and
Brahms’ pianoforte Concerto in D minor, kept the
multitude reasonably happy for about two hours
and a half. Of these five numbers the Concerto
scored the biggest success, on the strength of its
all-round effect, and the particularly interesting
perforniance of Edouard Scharf, who took the diffi-
cult piano parts from memory.
** * *
Next Saturday afternoon the second of
Allan’s ballad concerts will be given at the Town
Hall, and in the evening Walter Bentley is to try
his “Mirth, Song, and Story ” entertainment. At
St. George’s Hall the course of Dante the Great
runs smooth, and the fact that the elegant
magician and his show are all right has become so
generally known that some of his tricks get a
round of applause before they begin. At the
Alexandra the Grattan Riggs season ends this
week, and on Saturday old friend Dan Barry will
pop up again, after a long absence, with “ The
Sixth Commandment.”
Q. Chief Justice Griffith, when interviewed
by a Northern newspaper man, declined at first
to say anything about Federation; but, being
pressed for at least a few words, put his views
into three —“ Go for it! ”
Roderic Quinn’s book of verses, “ The
Hidden Tide ” (Is. 9d. post free from Bulletin
office) has received uncommonly good critical
notices everywhere, and has evidently nestled
close to the hearts of Australian poetry-lovers.
By the way, what is probably Quinn's finest story
—“Margaret”—will appear in next Bulletin
Xmas number.
The Secret Conference Telegraph (so-
called on account of the Secret Conference of
directors, at which it was stealthily decided to
oppose Federation) tells the public that, under
Federation, N.S.W.’s Id. town-postage “must
go.” Why? There are four provinces—N.S.W.,
Tasmania, Queensland, and W. A.—with Id. town-
postage, and why will they give in to the two
provinces which have 2d. postage? Also, there
are three provinces with free newspaper-postage ;
why is it certain that they will give in to the other
three? Will the Australian press kindly rise up
and yell that deafening interrogation into the
shameless ear of the King-street organ till it gets
an answer ?

“Man’s Enemy”—another cursed derrink-homily—
defeats its purpose in the usual way by showing that the
really bad man of the play “ never touches,” because
it he did he wouldn’t be able to be half so wicked ;
whereas the man who does drink is a real good sort of
chap, who, if he’d been teetotal, might have been as bad
as t’other fellow. The episode of the good girl who
won’t marry the reformed boozer—not because the
Staunton curse might descend to her children—which
would have some sense in it—but because his adventuress
wife isn’t dead, is a biting commentary on the materialism
of modern Christianity. If there’s anything the ortho-
dox Christian is strong upon it is the small importance
of Death in the scheme of things—a mere nothing in
comparison with sin and crime. Yet to Death alone—
not to sin or crime—is eriven the power of severing the
marriage-tie. The sin of being dead is the only sin a
wife can commit that entitles a Christian husband to a
divorce.
Nowadays the good old word, “benefit," is always
dropped in favor of “complimentary testimonial
matinee,” or something equivalent. Old-ti'me stars used
to stipulate in their contracts for monthly or quarterly
“ bens.,’’ and they always saw to it that bumper houses
resulted. Half the benefl jiares of the present day also
work up their own “complimentary matinees” —but not
in the outspoken way of the bluff old-timer.
Nellie Stewart has to work hard for her salary at Drury
Lane. Matinees on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and
Saturday.
At the auction of Leon Caron’s effects the other day in
Sydney, two violins were put up. One instrument,
worth about £20, went for something over £4. For the
other, a violin of delicious tone which has been in Caron’s
hands over 20 years, there was no bid beyond a playful
suggestion of “ three bob.”
Melbourne people remark that Peggy Pryde’s last
nights at the Bijou were advertised as the last nights in
Australia—and now the little woman is back again at
Sydney Tivoli. Why these business tarradiddles? An
established importer of “ stars ” makes a mistake in not
teaching the public to put implicit faith in “ farewell"
announcements. One of these days Rickards will adver-
tise the “absolutely last” appearance of a celebrity—
Cinquevalli, perhaps—who is actually leaving the city for
good, and many who wouldn’t otherwise have missed the
show on any account will take it for granted that the
artist is coming back once, anyhow, and will wait for the
chance that never comes off.
Dampier, reinforced by daughter Lily and son-in-law
Rolte, has concluded a really prosperous season at Ade-
laide Royal.

blanket—I’ve got a hat."
An anti-Federal lie which should make
the Sydney Telegraph’s financial editor snudder
at the awful arithmetic of his paper appeared in
that organ last Tuesday:—
The ABSOLUTE MAJORITY amendment made at the
Premiers’ Conference is not so simple as it looks.
It provides that amendments in dispute between the
two Houses shall only be deemed to be carried if at the
joint sitting an absolute majority of the total number of
members of both Houses support them.
Consequently, if parties are almost equally divided, a
few members on the weaker side can nullify the provision
by staying away from the sitting.
If they do so, a majority of the total membership of
both Houses cannot be obtained.
There will probably be 109 members in the two
Federal Houses, though the actual number makes
no difference. When they sit together to decide
a deadlock it will require an absolute majority-
55 votes —to carry the proposition, whatever it is.
If the majority is only the smallest one possible,
then there will be 55 votes for and 54 against.
And the above lunatic gravely alleges that if “a
few members on the weaker side ” —a few of the
54 that is—stay away, the 55 will therefore cease
to be a majority of the total membership of
109, and the provision will be “nullified.” Any
person blessed with even the rudiments of arith-
metic would reckon that, even if all the weaker
side —the 54- stayed away, the fact that 55 is a
majority of 109 would still remain. It is founded
on the solid rock of the multiplication-table, and
the staying away of the entire universe couldn’t
alter it. Isn’t the Telegraph at all ashamed
of the exhibition it is making of itself? *

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Maoriland, according to a rather dilatory bit of
cable intelligence, has a surplus for the year ended 31st
March, 1899, of £274,717, and a credit-balance of £221,144
brought forward from last year makes the total surplus
£495,861. Most of this will probably be transferred to
the Public Works Fund for railway-building and other
purposes, for Maoriland is the only one of the Seven Pro-
vinces that has no old deficit to wipe off. But, all the
same, the past year was a most lamentable one, so far as
the public debt was concerned. The public incubus
increased from £44,963,424 to £46,938,006 —an addition of
£1,974,582. This isn’t quite so bad as it looks, for £500,000
of the money went to provide funds for the State Land
Bank to lend out on freehold security, and £499,000 was
for the purchase of estates for closer settlement —still, it
is bad enough. And, in view of these things, the Tory
howl for a reduction of taxation is a very ill-timed
hypocrisy.
The Maoriland returns and some recent news
from W.A. makes it possible to show how five of the
Seven Provinces are getting on so far as the financial year
has gone :
Surplus.
Queensland (lOmonths) .. £686,991
Maoriland (12 „ ) .. 274,717
Deficit.
Sou !h Australia ( 9 „ ) .. ±10,637
Westralia (10 „ ) .. 107,248
N.S. Wales (10 „ ) .. 574,724
Except in the case of Maoriland these are, of course, only
interim reports. The N.S.W. deficit will almost certainly
be much smaller, and the Queensland surplus very much
smaller at the end of the financial year.
» • * *
Up to 31st March, 1899, the old-age pensions
granted in Maoriland amounted to £128,273 per annum.
As the bulk of the claims are now in, this probably
means that the annual liability, when all the patriarchs
have been overhauled and sorted out, won’t exceed
£150,000 per annum for the present.
* * * •
At 30th June, 1898, the public debt of Westralia
was £8,947,954, or ±52 6s. 9d. per inhabitant. At 31st
Dec. it was £10,188,175, or £6O 11s. lid. per inhabitant.
In ’9l Westralia owed £3O ss. Bd. per inhabitant, and was
the least-indebted province of the Seven. Now it occupies
a middle place, having piled up a larger debt, in propor-
tion to population, than Victoria, N.S.W., or Tasmania.
In another year, at the present rate, it will have also left
Maoriland behind.
* * * •
The municipality of South Singleton (N.S.W.)
estimates that its receipts from all sources for the present
year will be £514, and expenditure £857. And nobody
looked surprised or shocked, or suggested that the rates
should be increased in order to make ends meet. Appa-
rently South Singleton is quite satisfied to scoot along its
cheery road to insolvency.
* * * *
For the first time in many years, the banking
returns for last quarter showed N.S. W. with a larger stock
of gold than Victoria: N.S.W., £6,375,938: Victoria,
£5,973,670. ’

The A.M.P. Society issues its balance-sheet (the
fiftieth) for the year ending 31st December, 1898, and a
very prosperous-looking document it is in every respect.
Some recent years’ revenue items pan out as follows :
Premiums in- . ,
eluding con- Interest Total Added
sideration for &c. Income. „ tO ,
Annuities. Funds.
1893 .. £1,272,171 £669,779 £1,941,950 £626,138
1894 .. 1,270,835 699,654 1,970,489 480,664
1895 .. 1,311,585 698,259 2,009,844 727,372
1896 .. 1,333,241 696,433 2,029,674 565,927
1897 .. 1,374,296 706,270 2,080,566 751,039
1898 .. 1,431,570 720,607 2,152,177 699,471
The A.M.P.'s accumulated pile of wealth now' amounts to
£15,179,049, which should be sufficiently stupendous to
satisfy anybody. It provides £36,245 for depreciation of
securities and wear and tear of things in general, and dis-
tributes £479,742 in bonuses, as compared with £445,235
a year ago. The expenses (£l3 18s. 7d. per cent, on
premiums or £8 19s. lOd. per cent, on total receipts) are
heavier than they have been any year since 1892 and show
a considerable increase on last year’s figures, but the
A.M.P. is still by far the most cheaply-conducted life
office in Australasia. The statement of accounts is clearer
and more complete than that of any other life office in
these provinces, and the list of assets shows no dubious
item or items to v'hich, on the evidence now before the
court, any objection can be taken. Though why the
A.M.P. doesn’t issue a detailed catalogue of assets after
the fashion of the Ne.w York Life 00. and thus put things
beyond question it is difficult to say. One good feature is
that the great pile of mortgage investments has diminished
a little, and a possibly good feature is the increase of
£580,000 in the holding of Government securities. It
would be an undeniably good feature if it wasn’t that
£505,000 of the increase is caused by an investment in the
rather dubious securities of Sandgroper Land.
One thing which is rather regrettable is that
the reserve for possible depreciation of securities has been
allovved to run down from £288,000 a year ago to £266,000.
The sum looks large, but it isn’t much over 3 per cent, of
the mortgages, or l)/> per cent, of the total investments.
Also, it is noticeable that the interest earnings have made
another considerable drop—a trouble that all the as-
surance offices have had to face of late years. The rate
realised in the last six years has been :— *
1893 £5 13 6 per cent. 1896 £5 0 5 per cent.
1894 511 10 „ 1897 417 0 „
1895 5 5 2 „ 1898 414 10 „
One of the standing arguments for the A.M.P. Society
when the annual comparison with its hated rival, the
Maoriland Government Department, is published in the
S.M. Herald, has been the extra interest rate earned by
the private office, hut considering that the A.M.P. is now
down to £4 14s. lOd. against the State office’s £4145., there
is so little margin left that this branch of the row ought
to cease somewhere about now. The steady drop in
interest shows that the A.M.P. w r as w'ell-advised w'hen it
took time by the forelock and reduced its estimates to 3Vf>
per cent.
Despite the increased expenses, however, and
the reduced interest, the A.M.P. Society is a very great
and prosperous affair, and few concerns of its kind in this
world can compare with it. Also its prosperity seems
to become more aggressively healthy ever year.
And just on account of its prosperity and its
great size, the question of State Life Assurance
and State Audit becomes more and more pressing
in Australia. The population of these provinces is so
small, and it has got so enormous a proportion of its
eggs in the A.M.P.'s big basket, that if anything went
wrong with that institution the consequences would be
too shuddersome to be seriously thought of. In fact, the
A.M.P. is growing so large that, if anything very bad
happened to it, Australia would feel like closing up alto-
gether. So big a pile ought to be surrounded by every
safeguard that the State can give it.

The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society
issues its report for 1898. The revenue figures compare
with some previous returns as follows :
Premiums , , . .. , ,
including Total Added to
consideration Interest. Income. runds.
for annuities.
1892 £312,494 .. £80,115 .. £392,609 .. £150,236
1893 308,730 .. 81,023 .. 389,756 .. 139,704
1894 305,530 .. 86,953 .. 892,483 .. 131,328
1895 303,983 .. 89,703 .. 393,686 .. 130,207
1896 311,558 .. 81,147 .. 392,705 .. 117,137
1897 312,450 .. 84,562 .. 897,012 .. 112,370
1898 322,768 .. 90,130 .. 412,898 .. 108,314
Last year’s income is therefore the best the Colonial
Mutual has had up to date, both premium and interest
receipts showing a large increase. The total funds are
now £2,261,656.
In other respects most of the objections which
The Bulletin took to the Colonial Mutual’s accounts last
year still hold good, though in a modified form only. The
C.M., like some other Australasian offices, has hitherto
based its policy-contracts on the assumption that its
funds, during the currency of its existing policies, will
earn 4 per cent, interest. It has either to keep on earn-
ing the 4 per cent., or make provision, by setting aside a
large sum of money out of its profits, to reduce the as-
sumed interest to, say, 31 per cent., or else be insolvent —
in which respects it is just like any other office. The
Colonial Mutual last year earned £4 Is. 7d. per cent, on
its total average funds, which is a very narrow margin,
though it is better than the figures for 1898, when the in-
terest earned on the average funds was only £4 Os. lOd.
per cent. No other office of any size or standing in Aus-
tralia considers itself safe with so narrow a margin to
provide for a possible further drop in interest rates.
Under these circumstances, the Colonial Mutual manage-
ment has done one eminently wise thing. It has decided
to increase its premium rates so as to enable it to place
its business on the basis of a3J per cent, estimate. Pre-
sumably this can only refer to new business, the contracts
with old policy-holders being a fixed quantity. The new
arrangement will make the institution much more secure,
still it doesn’t leave so large a margin of safety even on
the new business as most other offices think desirable, and
apparently the old business remains just about where
it was.
Some figures on this subject are as follows :

earned timates are Margin,

The Mutual Life Association is reducing its estimates of
interest to £3 10s., reckoning that the present margin of
14s. 9d. is too narrow, and the National Mutual lately set
aside £50,000 with a view to a similar reduction. Among
the large Australasian assurance offices the Colonial
Mutual, even with its 3J per cent, estimate for new
policies, has the smallest margin, and the best that can be
said for it is that the Widows’ Fund, which is getting into
a rather bad way in this respect, has almost as small a
margin. As regards the old policies the Colonial Mutual
has a better margin than it had last year (it was then only
10d.), but a remarkably small one none the less.
The trouble is all owing to the fact that
the Colonial Mutual earns less interest on its
funds than any other of the large Australasian
assurance offices. If this arises through the fact
that a large portion of its business lies abroad in
countries where interest rates are low, then the thing
can’t be helped ; in that case it is only necessary to re-
mark in passing that the extension of the business to
England, Scotland, Ireland, the Cape of Good Hope,
Natal and the Transvaal, if it produces such consequences,
is a pretty bad disaster for the Australian policy-holders.
Under these circumstances the Colonial Mutual, if it
wants to make itself anything like as safe a concern for
its policy-holders as the A.M.P. or M.L. State Depart-
ment, needs, not to reduce its estimates on new policies
to 3i per cent., but to reduce its estimates on all policies
to 3 per cent. The large sum of money which that
would require would knock the bottom out of bonuses
for a while to come. And if the small interest earn-
ings arise through the fact that losses and deprecia-
tion of assets haven’t been fully provided for, it will re-
quire a writing-off of about £300,060 to bring the interest
earnings up to even the modest figure shown by the
Widow’s Fund. Presumably the management will face
this question at the approaching quinquennial investiga-
tion and put its institution on a more satisfactory footing.
But it looks like a pretty large question even now, though
the decision to increase premium rates certainly removes a
part of the difficulty.
On another point the Colonial Mutual shows a
marked improvement. Expenses are a little over £l9 4s.
per cent, on total income, or about £24 12s. per cent, on
premiums, and though these figures are very high—much
higher than they ought to be—still they are about £1
per cent, less than last year’s outgoings. The balance-
sheet still fails to distinguish between accrued interest
and interest in arrear, or to show separately property
acquired by foreclosure, but this habit of reticence seems
to be incurable. To sum up—things look a little better
with the C.M. all round, but they need to look a great
deal better yet before they will be quite satisfactory.
The Australian Mutual Fire Insurance Society
had a good time during the year that ended on 31st
March, 1899, and realised a net profit of £17,530. A
combination of good luck and good management has pro-
duced the following handsome show of profits :
1892 . £15,546 1896 .. £15,087
1893 .. 15,377 1897 .. 15,851
1894 .. 17,068 1898 .. 17,647
1895 .. 15,668 1899 .. 17,530
With last year’s balance the sum available is £18,709.
The shareholders receive 8 per cent, dividend, £2OOO.
Twenty per cent, of the premiums (£8109) is divided as a
bonus between shareholders and policy-holders ; policy-
holders get a rebate of £4055, and the same amount is
divided among shareholders, so the latter get the gor-
geous return of over 24 per cent, per annum. Another
£2500 is added to the reserve fund making it £lOl,OOO.
This is the largest fire insurance reserve in Australia, the
Australian Alliance (Melbourne) with £75,000 being a poor
second best —though the two Maoriland giants leave both
these records so far behind that the best Australian co.
doesn’t get within cannon-shot of them. The Australian
Mutual Fire also adds £5OOO to contingency fund,
making it £14,000, so the total reserves are now
£115,000. The balance-sheet is painfully reticent about
the nature of the investments, the great bulk of them
being mentioned in one line as “ Investments, city free-
hold property and mortgages, £108,89Q.” Still there is
no evidence against the absolute soundness of these secu-
rities, and, by reason of its high record in all other re-
spects, the co. is hereby discharged without a speck on
its character.

M'Lanrin stated in his anti-Federal speech that
Reid’s estimate of £500,000 as the cost of the Federal
Govt, was too low, and that he put it at £750,000. Then
he proceeded, a little later on, to say that N.S.W. would
have to contribute £1,631,000 in customs duties towards
that £750,000, and out of her contribution she would get
back £612,000 under the clause which provides for the
return of three-fourths of the customs revenue to the
State—£6l2,ooo being quite obviously three-fourths of
£1,631,000. A statement like that amounts almost to
genius.
* * * *
A considerable sensation in Sydney commercial
circles is the embarassment of a large cash grocery busi-
ness, noted for its big Govt, contracts. Several of the
middlemen will be hit for large sums if the firm seeks the
Insolvency Court. The disaster, no doubt largely
attributable to bad management, was in no small measure
the result of a family row.
B.H. Block 10 issues what the directors intro-
duce as “ the best report for many years.” The net profit
for the half-year was £50,723 ; this is inclusive of some-
thing (probably about £15,000) received for zinc tailing's
which were produced In former years. Block 10 has,
however, for eight years past consistently followed a
policy of equalising divs. as far as possible, and so only
£20,000 has been distributed among shareholders—less
by 15000, that is, than was paid in the corresponding
half of ’97-8, when the profit was only £20,546. It isn’t at
all safe, therefore, to accept Block 10’s div.-announce-
ments as a guide to the state of things at the mine. Of
the surplus of £30,000 odd a trifle goes to the depreciation
fund, £15,000 is used as the basis of a reserve-fund
(and these directors don’t mind saying how it is in-
vested—in Victorian Government 3 per cents.) and
the balance goes forward. The reserve fund is to be
added to, and is to be employed, “ should occasion arise, to
erect additional works for the further treatment of by-
products or to equalise dividends.” At the end of the
half-year (March 31) the co. had, apparently apart from
the reserve, £28,085 cash in hand and other liquid assets,
which made a total of £69,468 ; the only doubtful line was
“estimated surpluses to be received, £734o”—and, as
things have turned out, that must be more than all right.
And the total liabilities were £6027. With the mine look-
ing well, with the mill doing more work as well as a little
better work, and with a good metal-market, the directors’
observation may pass that this is the best report issued by
the co. for years.

Lewis Lloyd, owner of Burraga mine, Bathurst
district (N.S.W.), left for England last week. The mine
goes on as usual making a big monthly profit from a com-
paratively small output. Before going-, Lloyd conde-
scended to accept another very substantial deposit for
buying option. Both deposit and principal are much
larger than hitherto received and agreed upon. Well
known that during the last 12 years several deposits have
been put up and forfeited on this mine and each time the
price has gone up. The last was paid and partially for-
feited by the representatives of the Anglo-Australian Co.
—why, it is hard to guess. The deal was proposed early
last year when the copper-market was well" up, the price
of the mine was low, and, having a splendid record of over
20 years, its acquisition would have gone far to save the
intending buyers from their present embarrassment.
They, too, unless writer is misinformed, admit their
serious mistake by recent overtures to Lloyd to take the
mine at a much higher price than that at which it has
now been bonded.

Carcoar, N.S.W. : “The Gallymont tributors
have cleaned up for a month’s work, 300 tons for 12dwt.
per ton. Expenses incurred at start will be a heavy charge
on first div., but for the next few months they expect to
reap a rich harvest.” This is really tew much ! Many
thousands in cash given for the property, tens of thou-
sands spent in plant, all under the active personal super-
intendence of the able and experienced Eissler. The
first crushing a horrible disappointment, the next worse,
and finally the mine shut down on the advice of a mining
engineer sent specially from London to decide what was
best to do ; and now, when Eissler has left Australia in
great distress over his failure, and they who once swore
by him are swearing at him, tributors are expecting to
reap a rich harvest out of the mine. A little while ago it
was stated that the Anglo-Exploration Co. was going to
console the Gallymont shareholders by the free gift of
another mine—Mt. Boppy—a custom worked with Wes-
tralian “ cats ” to such an extent that offers of this sort
became regarded as adding insult to injury. But the Ex-
ploration Co. denies that it thinks of giving all Mt. Boppy
to the Gallymonters.

News-wire from Blayney: “The copper-mine
has re-started work. The water-jackets have arrived and
are being erected. By mistake, a stamper-battery was
forwarded instead of a furnace, and but for this the fur-
nace would be erected.” The first is not true, and the
latter would be a good joke if it were. The news-man has

Oobar notes. —Cobar’s main supply of mining
water ran out early in January, and no rain of consequence
has fallen since. The big copper mine now gets its supply
from Cobar Gold Mines, and pays handsomely for it. The
town tank for domestic purposes will be dry in a week or
so, and the G.M. Co. consents to give the people some
water at double the Government’s charges. “ It’s an ill
wind that blows no one good.” By the way, Cobar
Gold Mines aforesaid will need at least four months
more to get ready for a start on the large scale.
Arrangements for providing funds for the Chesney’s big
plant are expected to be disclosed at the co.’s coming
half-yearly meeting at Melb. The Great Western is
slowiy erecting an awkward toy-cyanide plant.—Mount
Drysdale and Eldorado cos. are erecting a cyanide plant
to treat their tailings—two heaps, each about 7000 tons of
tolerably-rich materials. There are three Huntington
mills on the spot to create more sand when rain falls. The
mine water has been found admirably suited for cyanida-
tion, and, as there is plenty of it, big things are expected
of the plant. Water in Drysdale main shaft makes quick
enough to keep the plant in full operation.

Lake George, N.S.W. , March and April returns
show a production of over 11,000 tons, for 180 tons of
copper, 8360 z. gold, and over 30,0000 z. silver—ore aver-
aging in copper between l£ per cent, and 1| per cent. ;
gold, a shade over ljdwt., and silver a little over 2£oz.
Value per ton on price of metals 375. 9d. for March and
355. sd. for April. Costs for March, mining, handling,
smelting, development, and general expenses, 15s. 6d.
per ton ; estimated cost of transport and realisation, Bs.
7d. For April, 15s. 7d. and 7s. 7d. per ton respectively.
Accepting these figures of costs and values as accurate,
the profit shown for the two months is a fraction under
13s. a ton—a very good thing where production is large,
and could be doubled if warranted by stability of the
copper-market; but it is obvious, with copper at the
average price of the last five years, the Lake George, as
the Yanks would say, is a very “ close proposition.” Time
shareholders knew something definite re transport and
realisation charges, always given in the form of estimates.
All very well for the time being, but that is the last ever
heard of them, from which it may be inferred the esti-
mates are a little too modest; though 7s. 7d. and Bs. 7d.
on each ton of ore seem enormous. Imagine one-half the
total of handling, development, smelting, manag-
ing, and general expenses being absorbed in sending away
matte and realising on it? Would there not be a saving
in refining at the mine, or at the nearest coalfield ?

The South Tharsis Copper Co., Mt. Lyell,
have lately entered into a contract with the Austral Otis
Engineering Co., South Melbourne, to supply a complete
crushing and concentrating plant for treatment of their
ores, which are mostly low grade. The plant is to be a
very complete one and comprises compound steam-engine
and boiler of 100 horse-power, 3 rock-breakers, 2 sets Roger
rolls, 8 4-compartment eccentric jiggs, 4 improved buddies
and Otis circular vanner, with the necessary trommels,
&c., for sizing and classifying the ore. The plant
has a capacity of 100 tons per day, with provision
for 200 tons. The Otis Co. are also supplying a self-acting
tramway from the mine to the mill; also, a pumping plant
to supply the mill with water from the dam.

Be the boom in dredges. Vic. Minister Best,
who has been visiting M.L., finds that 75 per cent, of the
dredges working on the Molyneux River are paying. They
cost from £4OOO to £lO,OOO each, the latter class being up
to latest date. A well-written description of the dredges
working on this river has been furnished Sydney Daily
Telegraph by D. K. Inglis, but it is sadly lacking in detail
and averages. Low capitalization is admitted—there is
no flood of vendors’ shares—and N.S.W. speculators are
asked to bear this well in mind. “ From 25 to 30oz. may be
looked on as the normal return for an average week’s
work, but at times, with a good bit of stripping, the
return may run away to between 600 oz. and 700 oz.” The
total expenses do not, it is claimed, exceed £5O a week.
But same article indicates occasional accidents when the
dredges would not work for days and weeks, while exes
would be about the same, if not more, on account thereof.
The capital of the Golden Gate co. is only £2500. The weekly
return a fortnight ago was 1610 z., and the working exes Boz.

there is evidence that new blood, and perhaps better

lodes. The inueh-talked-of Anchor is, at any rate, being
worked with better results, and promises to come up to
within decent range of what the less idiotic of its backers

The worst feature of many big Anglo-Australian
mining co’s is that the controlling interest is held by
financial co’s, often consisting of a mere handful of Fat-
men, so that the really important business is done outside
the companies’ meetings altogether. This is what is the
matter with Lake View Consols, and probably explains
the extraordinary financial policy of that concern. And
to kick against it seems about as useless on the other side
as it would be here. One venturesome shareholder, who
wanted the money earned to be distributed, has, he pub-
lishes, made a discovery that a day or so before the last
L. V. Consols meeting 34 persons had one share each trans-
ferred and registered to them, that these people attended
the meeting and voted (the voting was by show of hands),
and that the whole lot of them were at the time clerks
either of the L.V. Consols or of the boss London and Globe

VCRY DLO SPECLAS
"D.C.L"
■ Lord Beauchamp, the new N.S.-Wales
Governor, was canny enough to say, on reaching
Albany, that at present he was not in a position to
express his views regarding Federation. Yet
Corkran, private secretary, handed the press the
following astounding message from Lord Beau-
champ to the people of N.S. Wales. It is in
verse, being an adaptation of a verse of Rudyard
Kipling’s “The Song of the Cities ”
Greet,—Your birthstain have you turned to good,
Forcing strong wills perverse to steadfastness.
The first flush of the tropics in your blood,
And at your feet success.—Beauchamp.
Strangely enough, this appears in S.M. Herald,
but not in Daily Teleuraph. What on earth
coula ever have induced the young gentleman to
thus “put his foot in it” by leading off with so
direct a reference to the One Forbidden Subject—
to the fact that the N.S.W. community is a pump-
kin, a large and succulent pumpkin, grown on a
particularly nasty dung-heap—is, and will pro-
bably ever remain, the profoundest of mysteries.
SEE MISUNDERSTOOD.
HIM: “ Woman! I did not deceive you! Before
we were married I told you I had a bad heart.”
HER: “ You did, Reginald—you did! But, as
heaven is my hope, I thought you meant heart-
disease!”
That clumsy and inexplicable birth-stain
reference of Lord Beauchamp’s roundaboutly recalls
Lady Jersey’s immortal “Who are these people
and whence have they sprung?” Most people
come to grief if, when they feel gushy, they
attempt to convey their over-wrought emotions in
poetry. If the unsophisticated young Earl, who
has come out here sans a qualified bear-leader, had
consulted (say) the experienced Capt. Wallington,
he could easily have ascertained that the denizens
of Botany Bay aren’t a bit proud of having risen
superior to the condition of poor grandpa, who
w:is lagged a long time ago. In fact, they aren’t
taking any reference, direct or constructive, to
grandpa aforesaid.

.N.S.W. church circles are disturbed about
the doctrinal and other ecclesiastical opinions
ascribed, rightly or wrongly, to the young Gover-
nor with the wavy hair and perfect teeth. A few
aggressive elc-ios, at a recent meeting, urged that
he deserved to be kept at arms’-length until he
purged hunself from suspicion. But it was ruled
that all should attend the levee and await the
future. I o stay away in a body from a Governor’s
levee would no doubt be an extreme step, but the
step was once taken by the R.C. Church in N.S.W.
JNo -‘YC'm cleric or lay, attended Gov. Denison’s
levee in 1809. The Gov. had in a lecture crossed
K.C. temper, the word went round, and the levee
was deserted. The action was intended to stun
the Gov. and the public. But the Gov. said he
didn t care, and good old S.M. Herald next
morning printed among those present the names
d n ru' 0 lay and cleric, of the
K.C. Church. Lady Denison, writing home about
it, said the reporter must have been asleep, or
composed his list of names before the levee started.
But Sydney gossip knew better. The Herald
merely meant to spoil the public effect of the R.C.
stratagem.

South Australia’s new Governor, Lord
Tennyson, has already had one compliment paid
him : the ‘Tennyson sausage” has arrived. In
this instance the compliment is a peculiarly
delicate) one, as every sausage is popularly
supposed to be some unhappy canine’s “In
Memoriam.” Gov. Buxton had a brand of beer
named after him, and as His present Ex.’s
illustrious sire wrote “ Grossing the Bar,” the
precedent is sure to be followed.
Not long ago, a man was sen-
tenced at Bendigo (Vic.) to three years’
hard for stealing some old shirts from
a lawn - tennis club - room. In same
Court, a few months back, a person
who had systematically robbed his em-
ployers for nearly two years got 18
months, and a petition is now being
extensively signed to procure his re-
lease, after serving but a few months
of his sentence. Moral —well, there are
several morals to this.

A lone Perth (W.A.) citizen was
recently absent from town for a few
days on a fishing expedition, and on
his return to his diggings was aston-
ished to find everything upside-down-
all his private papers, letters, etc., lying
scattered on the floor. On asking for
an explanation, he was told by his
friends, “Oh ! we thought you had com-
mitted suicide.” He has since been
wondering whether they were disap-
pointed.

age, has spent 24 of them in gaol,

“T.D.”: Quite the thing now
ladies in evening garb to ride home
from theatres atop of Sydney ’buses.
The staircase ’bus adds materially to
the inconvenience of being a man.
In bland weather he has to make
shift on the side-rail or creep inside
while fair damsels usurp his ac-
customed place, but he has to ride
outside when the stormy winds are
blowing ; else stand inside, with the
roof battering his head, and endure
the cold glare of the seated women
who regard him as an intruder.
The ancient and. abominable hurdy-gurdy
has been under a cloud in Sydney since the recent
arrival of a large orchestral organ of modern type.
The latter is a revelation in its way. People
generally supposed to detest any form of music
other than “ How-doo-dee ” (or something like
that) cluster and gape while the street instrument
turns off Handel’s “Hallelujah,” Mascagni’s In-
termezzo, and other such trifles. Writer, by the
way, is surprised to find that the “ Hallelujah ” is
just as good music outside a threepenny bar as it
is in a cathedral.

can collar a D.C. Judgeship with <£lsoo salary !

“Perce” : Some recent Bulle-
tin swimming pars, seem to indi-
cate that women prefer hairy
men. If true, it shows
that the usual fool femi-
nine knows nothing 1 on a
subject of which she
should know all; but it
is only consistent with
woman’s inconsistency
that she knows less about
man than about almost
any other animal. Even
lacking the experience,
common sense should tell
her that the more hairy
a man, the nearer he is
to the brute, physically;
consequently, so long as
a woman served his pur-
pose he would not care
if she hadn’t a rag to her
back, or was all rags. It
is the smooth - skinned
man who reveres, loves,
and perennially pampers
woman as if she were
superior clay. He buys
her diamonds, poodles,
and bicycles, and will
walk himself, that she
may ride. The very hairy
man is simply a talking
gorilla. [Plausible, but
not necessarily conclu-
sive. Some of the world’s
intellectual giants have
been, and are, hairy men.
‘‘Perce” confounds phy-
sical attributes with men-
tal development. Even
were his proposition true, it doesn’t
prove woman to be the fool he thinks
she is. Women prefer Mastery to
Worship.—Ed. B.]

“Doctor”: N.S.W. State Chil-
dren’s Relief Board allows up to 7s.
6d. a week for the keep of children
boarded out to foster-parents. If
boarded out to their own parents
the maximum is 2s. 6d., “to pre-
vent imposition.” The depart-
ment has an army of inspectors
who, if they are worth their salt,
ought to make imposition impos-
sible. Either the former amount
is excessive, or the latter insuffi-
cient, e'xcept on the not un-
natural assumption that foster-
parents may be expected to starve
the children in order to feed themselves, while
the natural ones will starve themselves to feed
their children. Looked at from any point of view
the arrangement is a disgrace to civilisation.

Sydney Guv’ment House has had several
thousands expended on it since the retirement of
Lord Hampden, to fit it for the reception of his
unmarried successor. This public money has been
paid out without the advice of Parliament or re-
gard to any particular section of taxpayers.
Lxpenses connected with the vice-regal reception
have been ordered in the same fashion, and in
other ways vice-regal life in N. S.W. is assured of
having its wants lavishly attended to. The public,
instead of getting a tighter grip on vice-regal
expenditure as the years go by, seems to be more
and more losing grip. Young, Denison, Fitzroy,
and had to furnish the family apartments
at Govt. House. They had to pay for their own
pleasure-travelling about the country. Parlia-
ment voted nothing for these expenses. One of
the bitterest of Parliamentary discussions arose
through James Martin (afterwards Chief-Justice)
charging the Govt, of the day with having pur-
chased a necessary piece of furniture for Lady
Young’s bedroom. But now, everything is bought
which a Governor likes to ask for. Ministry vies
with Ministry as to which will the more lavishly
pour the taxpayers’ money at the vice-regal feet.

Brassey has once more “fallen off.”
Victorias tottersome Governor has long since
dropped off all his worldly possessions except the
mangle, and he is now reduced to dropping off
the same things a second time. So the unstable
prop of the State publicly fell from his horse in
Melbourne the other day, and banged his head
against a hard world. The newspapers charitably
try to disguise the affair by saying that the horse
was “ frightened by a passing pedestrian,” but the
public knows better. It is the old man’s con-
stitutional habit of dropping off breaking out
again. When Brassey is dead he will probably
fall up out of his grave the very first opportunity.
Lven death couldn’t quench the ancient’s yearning
to fall off.

Major-General French’s proclamation
shunting Tommy Atkins’creditors from the mat

Phillip, King, and Hunter ordinance that police
and convict warders were not to be garnisheed or
imprisoned for debt. Caveat creditor was the
maxim in such cases.

“ The success of Marconi's lineless tele-
graphing across the Channel,” writes The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent, “ will, without
doubt, have far-reaching effects. Since I inter-
viewed him for The Bulletin nearly two years
ago, the young inventor has much improved the
working of his system. The telegraphing between
Dover and Boulogne was perfect though slow, the
maximum rate of speed attained not exceeding 15
words a minute. The short and long electrical
waves thrown off by the transmitter to register
‘ dots ’ and ‘ dashes ’ at the receiving station are no
longer allowed to spread left and right. They are
concentrated similarly to the directed rays of a
bull’s-eye lantern. The message passes into the
air from an 80-foot wired pole at South Foreland
takes a direct and restricted air-path across the
channel to the Chalet 1’ Artois, where a similar
pole stands, which collects the symbols and passes
them to the receiver. Move the receiverso feet to
the right or left and it will miss the message. What
quotations for a slump in cables and copper ? ”

With wireless telegraphy and messages at
60,000 words a minute, telegraph-operators begin
to fear that their occupation will soon be gone. A
decade ago the youth who took to telegraphy
deemed himself “on to a good thing,” but the
majority have never got further than £2 10s. or
£3 a week, and the Civil Service Boards have de-
termined the fate of many others. Also, the
clicking instrument plays havoc with the opera-
tors’ nerves, and it is pitiful to note the subter-
fuges of the man, whose wrist has failed him,
hanging on to his billet as long as possible.

shove their boots in the slightest opening, and talk
unceasingly until the home-father fires them down

The protracted haggle as to the seaworthi-
ness of the ancient soft-wood ship Republic is
more or less a repetition of recent history. The
question really at issue is whether you can be
dead-sure as to the soundness of a ship until you
have seen her, stripped of copper, in the dock.
To examine and pass a suspected ship without
docking and stripping her is like trying to listen
to a man’s heart-sounds through a thick suit and
a frieze overcoat. And all the blather in the
world won’t alter that fact.

Womans nerve, in time of trouble, is a chancy
thing at best, the extreme of fortitude or the
extreme of fear being the usual thing with the
sex—no medium. Some years ago, in America,
when a trainful of passengers had to race through
. forest of flame, the women did their shriek™
while the warmth was still endurable, but, when
the semblance of Hades grew greater, the men
took up the chorus, and the women endured in
silence what their husbands and brothers leant
out of the windows to avoid. *

Tasmanian Land-and-Works Minister Pil-
linger died at Hobart Coffee Palace, a few days
ago, of heart-trouble, and ere his body was cold it
was taken to the Lands Office to await burial.
Queerly enough, the Lands Office was, in the old
days, St. Mary’s Hospital, and the other day its
old morgue received the. remains of the late
Minister. A leading official says he returned one
night to the office to do overwork, but the noises
were so unearthly that he cleared out and never
went there again after dark It was in St Mary s

More about that escape from Hobart
„ ao ] .
n)enth two pnsoners escaped-walked out of
Hobart’s old ramshackle gaol. The way out stared the
poor devils in the face every day, and gave them no rest
till they went it. They were away for a month, and
never left the neighborhood; and yet the police couldn’t
find them. One met a policeman in a public-house bar,
and “passed him the time o’ day, ’ and when, a week
after, he was arrested, he wd he spenUa day
without saluting a constable. But when the men were
caught (with the help of private people) the valiant-
police set about showing their enormous zeal. The new
commissioner from the poorhouse summoned a publican
for “harboring” one of the fugitives. The escaped one
was starving, and one night thrust his head through the
side-door and said— Pitch us a boh, Mick, to get some-
thin’feat.” And Mick tossed him a half-crown and told
him to go and give himself up. The two had made boots
together in their youth. Mick himself reported the in-
cident to the police, vet when Williams was caught the
publican was summoned for not running after the
escaped one and finding and securing him, and carrying
him before a justice. Mick weighs 24 stone, more or less,
in his socks, and couldn’t run if a hungry African lion
was on his track. “Going to plead K'/'d ty was the
question put to the huge one s lawyer. No fear! was
the reply of lawyer Propsting, “ we’re going to fight-
and, look here, we’re going to put the Attorney-General,
the Chief Commissioner, you, the two detectives, and
half the city force in the box, and show who’s to blame
for Williams not being caught.” The prosecution was
withdrawn in such haste that it nearly broke its neck
getting away.

diately a regiment arrives in a city at ’Ome,

JN .b. W. .Presbyterians donning armour for
their centenary thanksgiving of 1900 proclaim that
they must realise on that occasion 100,000 guineas.
A big sum, but with true business instinct they
earmark the first receipts with a sum of £l5OO for
an organising secretary. Communities with less
skill for money-making would have searched for
a secretary who would do the work for nothing, or
mere out-of-pocket expenses. The canny Scots,
however, know human nature better. They want
to rake in big money. They consequently tell the
man at the handle of the rake that they’ll give him
a cabinet minister’s salary. Whether or not they
get the 100,000 guineas, they start about it in the
right way.

A WOMAN’S LETTER
Sydney, May 16, 1899.
Mr Dear Mtee—
The pity of it! To think that, after all—all the
body-guard of aunt, sister, cousins, first-aides,
and nurses—Sonny has gone and got into
mischief. This enervated, aggravated, desecrated,
birth-marked city wonders if Beauchamp’s first
pill is a sample. The inherited colonial constitu-
tion will never swallow another with the coating
of “ Your birth-stain have you turned to good ! ”
Somebody in Authority must really point an
arrow at the ways our green young Governor
mustn’i go. Or has anybody been “pulling his
leg? But there—the shackles are so heavy on
me that my pen cannot do justice to this painful
subject.
Only, in passing, a window in Hunter-street
rather anticipated things last week with a burst
°f red-and-white chokers (not to be tied under
mi? ear )’ the “ Beauchamp ” necktie.
Ihe Beauchamp birth-stain is red and white,
don’t you know.
Apropos of absolutely nothing, a bride, who
belongs to a hoary Australian family, received a
dreadful wedding-present lately. At first glance,
it was an artless tablecloth of lovely linen. Bor
border, some exquisite embroidery worked out a
pattern that looked like the famous Egg and Dart
Everybody went into raptures over it. Then the
pure-merino bridegroom came along, and noticed
that the eggs were rather queer. He looked
closer, and discovered a wicked composition of
broad-arrows and. hangman’s loops. Luckily his
manhood stepped in, and he explained that some
woman who wanted to marry him must have done
this.
But, After all, what is Family ? What is Glory ?
What is Anything ? The story of Fairfax and the
Boots shipwrecks me on these spikey reflections.
r ° tlier day a bold, bad, blasphemous man went
into banners shop and said, “I am Mr. Fairfax
of the S.M. Herard, don’t you know. I want a
ready -made suit. . . . Also, a couple of hats,
and i am going up country and want a
pair of new boots. . . . Enter ’em all to
my account.” And no bolt came down from
the Herald to burn him up ! The ghastly
protanity of a Fairfax in a ready-made suit never
struck anyone in all that stylish establishment.
Ihe blasphemer got all he wanted, and ordered
the boots to be sent home. Outside the gates of
the family mansion lurked “ Mr. Fairfax ” as the
parcel-delivery drew nigh with the boots. He
seized them with eye, muttered words
to tne enect that he was going up country that
minute, and had been waiting there till those boots
came home, and made off round the corner. And
the poor benighted parcel-delivery saw nothing
incongruous in that —in a Fairfax who waited out-
side his gate for his new boots, and couldn’t go up
country without them ! Considering the splendor
of the gaudy young vision in knee-breeches and
burnished leggings,.that sometimes rises from a
certain editorial chair, this sacrilegious story must
be forgotten as soon as heard
It will take the new Governor some time to live
down the effects of that cablegram from Albany.
People in N.S.W. are terribly sensitive concerning
the birthstam ”so prettily alluded to by Kipling,
Beauchamp and co. It is well-known that the
deadliest revenge a vindictive person in Sydney
can take on some very high-toned families is to
paint a broad arrow on the gate-post during the
night. It is even said that one girl in Sydney who
is gaining a poor living by her own exertions ought
to possess much valuable city property; but to
Erove her claim she would have to acknowledge
erself of convict descent, and so she prefers to
struggle. There are weak spots in the story
apparent to the interested observer, but the inner
meaning may stand all the same.
Were Kipling to visit Sydney during the present
month it is almost certain that the last reception
of that man would be worse than the first. Before
the publication of Earl Beauchamp’s fatal messa,ere,
few people were familiar with “ The Song of the
Cities,” and the aspersion therein cast on the
Beautiful Harbor. Now Kipling’s “name is
mud ” to a vast section of the community, along
with somebody else’s. It is amusing to find His
Ex. now so pointedly remarking that he will
express no opinion concerning matters Australian
until he gets to know more about the country.
The burnt child dreads the fire. However, there is
one beneficent aspect to the Beauchamp blunder—
anything that may tend to stem the tide of
Kiplingmania comes as a temporary blessing.
The Fresh Air League Ball will be the Earl’s
first Australian hop. It comes off at the Town
Hall on Tuesday, 23rd May. The transcendental
pill, and all the little pillars of Society, promise
to make this the gayest ball of the season up to
date. By the way, why don’t the tickets say what
time the ball begins ? Is it to be so fashionably
and unmentionably late as all that?
His Ex. and suite will also shine on the Agri-
cultural Society’s ball—another brilliant affair to
be. This is a fixture for Wednesday, 31st May,
at the Town Hall.
The Jewish Ball —in aid of the Moses Monte-
fiore Home—follows next night, Thursday, Ist
June, at Paddington Town Hall.
By the way, it is just possible that Lord Beau-
champ and suite may shine on Madame Buhrow’s
dramatic entertainment at the Palace Theatre next
Thursday. A vice-regal telegram—in reply to the
committee—says that His Ex. will attend if not
too tired after the reception ceremonies.
For two or three years past some of the candi-
dates at the University public examinations have
been deaf mutes, but this year another innovation
is to take place. Several inmates of the Blind
Asylum, in imitation of Helen Keller, will present
themselves for examination, on June sth, at the
University. Of course, they cannot read the
, or wrl . ta tlu ; lr answers, but a number of
graduates, whom the authorities feel that thev
MV;n tr f L St ’ f re to be employed, as amanuenses.
h,, v 111 tne , re .be as many amanuenses as candidates?)
Ihe work is to be undertaken for love, not for
pay. It would certainly be much easier to do the
work outright than to write answers at another’s
bidding, especially if they happened to be the
wrong ones.
Prof. MaeCallum’s lecture on Madame de Stael
under the auspices of the Womanhood Suffrage
League on the 10th, attracted an overflowing
attendance. A member of the League (Miss
Meares, MA.) proposed a vote of thanks to the
lecturer and was seconded by another lady, who
remarked that she had successfully established a
oranch of the League at some country centre.
Whereupon an unmannerly man arose and said he
did not know what that had to do with Prof.
MacCallum s lecture, but he supposed it was use:
less to expect logic from the New Woman : also, he
could not see what the Prof.’s lecture on French
literature had to do with the League at all. Some
in the audience began to wonder if he could see
his way home.
A delightful “ young ” dance was the North
Sydney Rowing Club’s Ball at the local School of
Arts last I riday. The usual lining of chaperons
melted down to two or three ornamental figure-
heads who did duty for the whole big bevy of
pretty girls. Colored umbrellas shaded the lights
with a superfluous cunning considering that nearly
everyone in skirts was called Miss. Among lots
of charming girlish frocks a white chiffon struck
everybody with admiration of its three-tiered
skirt, early-Victorian bodice, and wide square
collar of indigestible-apple-green velvet. Pretty
Miss Lyne was in amber tulle with fragile-looking
rucmngs; Miss Randal Carey in sky-blue satin:
in short, there was not a dissonant note in any-
body s f rocking.
One of the ‘ ‘ Points ” is in a flutter owing to the
fate of two fascinating damsels and their still
more alluring mother. About a year ago the head
of the family died, and the three gave up house-
keeping and went to board. One daughter made
a wealthy marriage the other day, another is to do
ditto in six months, while the widow herself is
said to be engaged to an eligible suitor. All the
partners in folly are (or were) fellow-boarders.
But the saddest part of it is that the boarding-
house is already quite full, so there is really no
use in publishing this story.
The Pleyel concerts started their new season last
Wednesday at Y.M.C.A. Hall. Never wildly
crowded, these chaste concerts still support the
good old wheeze, the “’igher the Art the Fewer
the Few.” (A Cockney version is, “the
igher the Art the ’orrider the ’armony.”)
And the Pleyel audience is a thing you
can pick out from a crowd—long-haired, foreign,
and bent on nothing but a flow of soul, and
the best music it can get. Signor Alba was
Wednesday’s new feature. He turned out to
be a big bearded man with a voice like a trombone
—a great voice, the largest and longest we have had
here for some time. It rushed down underground
passages with smiling vigor and sent up new notes
from the lower regions unbroken by their dizzy
journey. An eccentricity of time and a formally-
announced cold stole something from the Signor’s
effects. Also, the beard was a slight deterrent to
a city that likes a lot of lip with its love-songs.
Signor de Beaupuis played Chopin and De Beau-
puis with just “ the little less ” that “ how much
it is ” ! This variable musician can play like an
archangel when he chooses, but on Wednesday he
was merely a Signor. By the way, two musicians
in this co. are so remarkably alike that quite a
phenomenon is thrown in with the concert, for one
is beautiful and one isn’t, and yet you can’t tell one
from t’other. As for the highly-cultured quar-
tette itself, whatever it does is well done, as
Schubert and Mendelssohn both testified this
particular evening.
There was also music made at the Railway
Institute last week. It was a benefit evening for a
sick railway-man’s family, and was entirely suc-
cessful financially. The big hall was filled. But
the audience was overfilled. Six comic songs in
succession, with five verses to each song, shed a
gloom on the evening. Miss Inez Bensusan re-
cited for twenty minutes to front rows only.
The back seats had to feast on her scarlet tulle
blouse. Nugent Robertson’s play was quite the
most cultivated plant in the bear-garden. A slight,
subtle little episode about a man who didn’t know
he loved the other woman till the husband of yet
another woman died and showed him that he
didn’t want her. Miss Mercy Murray played the
truly-loved woman gracefully, but rather wailfully
for a chosen one. A.N.R.’s acting would have
driven Wilson Barrett to epilepsy. He neither
posed, strutted, nor ranted. For an amateur it
was sensationally natural. He carried all his pre-
cepts into execution, even to the reading aloud of
an announcement of a death from a daily paper.
Your true professional always eloeutes when he
reads anything, whether it’s a love-letter or a
tailor’s bill.
The Press Bazaar still has its meetings. The
Daily Telegraph has withdrawn. The Evening
News regrets that a business agreement precludes
it. The Sunday Times think the Press should
have a show of its own six months later, and has
also gone back on the movement which started, by
the way, with the same journal. Now remain of
the papers, definitely (others may join later, or
assist), the S.M. Herald, the Chinese Herald,
the Freeman’s Journal, the Dawn, and the
Sydney Mail, a union that ought to beget some-
thing astonishing.
i? y 18 ab ?, ut time to say that the scheme
wllT e £ ” rd y and wonderfully managed.
Week after week, for two or three months, the
committee sat and postponed itself because it
wasn t sure what sort of space it could have, or
whether the Bazaar was to be at the Exhibition
Building or the I own Hall. From the beginning
anyone could see that the Press was too tired and
esM!ol t « 0 ll dra? ti! t oel f u a i ong a giddy course hke this,
Wlt *u 2 Jth June coming on. Now is the
tune to drop the bazaar gracefully, acknowledging
that, while London can make .£lO,OOO, Sydney can
make a show of itself. J J
Many friends and flowers gathered at the Orotava
on Saturday to say good-bye to Emily Soldene,
1 10 K. 9® 9 n a tri P to London. Her benefit
brought in thanks to the energies of Mr.
Alfred -Nathan and Mr. T. M. Slattery.
But all the people who get benefits to take them
JLondonwards don t arrive there. I could tell you
°!i; >Ur v. fr ° ln tbis Clty who have received the con-
cert cheque that was to help them out of Aus-
tralia and are still walking about Sydney streets.
Which reminds me of the game of goi'ng-to-be-
married. A back-block teacher has been playing
this for 20 years, and has accumulated from dif-
ferent schools enough wedding-presents to bring
her m an annuity when her hair drops out.
The two Conti Sisters, Italia Conti and Evelyn
Matheze, are socially popular in Sydney. At
leir merry little tea-party last week many thea-
*™s, ™ seen off the chain, and everyone
regretted that the sparkling Italia, who is full of
charm and brightness off the stage, whatever she
may be on, is not to play to Sydney audiences.
P , e , matter j? er conge—for she is no longer one
of the Brough Co., and leaves for England shortly
seems to be rather a thorny affair, best left
alone by outsiders.
Miss Julie Wood viHe writes from Melbourne to
say that her health is much improved. She asks
me to thank, through this medium, all those who
so kindly contributed to her benefit-fund.
Quite the newest idea in brooches has been in-
troduced to Sydney by a returned traveller. In
America everyone” now wears the coat-of-arms
ot her native city made in enamel or mosaic, and
lined at the back with gold. Sydney girls who
Tf, 6 born ln Halifax or Montreal are very proud
of the pretty brooches which have been sent them.
Velvet blouses are now made in America a la
Can bald 1, and a complete set of gold studs and
sleeve-links adds a finish to this rather severe type
of costume.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
Brassey s new aide, Lord Hindlip, arrived
sate and sound, and was publicly uncorked
on the first available opportunity. He arrived
when he was most wanted, too ; for two of Uncle
ioms other aides, Cecil and Pakenham, were
laid-up with accidents just before he put in an
appearance leaving all the ‘ work ’ (as they call it)
to be done by long Dicky. Up to the present, the
D. V. Association has not offered Hindlip a recep-
tion, nor has there been a Band of Hope demon-
stration to welcome him; but it is already the
correct thing for men to ask for ‘Bass’s, please,’
at the fashionable hotels.
“ Adelaide martyrs begin to suspect that Gov.
lennyson is but a shade more sprightly than his
predecessor. So far, he hasn’t tooled his family
out in an elderly one-hoss shay after the manner
ot Buxton, but he’s hung a millstone round the
neck of his career in the shape of a married, olive-
branched aide.
“ The group of .Melb. enthusiasts interested in
packing little Fritz Mueller off to Germany
might as well have the common sense to
take the ‘Young Vic.’ ticket off the lad’s back.
It s all right to provide him with the money
necessary for a first-class musical education, but
there is really no excuse for representing this par-
ticular boy-pianist as a future credit to Australia.
He has a German name and a German face, and
he s going to Germany, and if he achieves any dis-
tinction. it will be as German as the sausages.
Australia will not get a show in the matter. By
the way, talking of boy-pianists, what glory has
Victoria gained from the exportation of Percy
Grainger ! Ihe last time Percy’s name figured in

Madame of the nipper’s talent her eloquence fell
flat. Then she appealed to Marshall-Hall, with-
out success, for the Prof, ’s liver was in a cynical

of Herr Pabst (who brought Percy Grainger out),
took the little fellow in hand and tutored him
gratis for two years, and her method has been
warmly commended by Herr Friedenthal, who

Mrs. Levien, Mrs. David Syme, and other cham-
pions of the infant-pianist and sonata-composer
are anxious to pack him and his mother off to
Berlin in time for the August exams., so that he
may enter the big training-school there at half-
fees. The mother has influential relatives in
Berlin, and will be able to push her boy into
notice whilst she is looking after his young
health. This fact is privately circulated in order
to dispel the idea that Fritz might as well be
despatched by himself.

“ Mrs. Marcus Clarke, speechifying neatly at

“ A dull, blue-nosed crowd came away from the
cold-muttony ’Varsity sports (9th May), sadder
and more snuffiesome than it went. In the
enclosure a few youths occasionally got into sacks,
jumped or cycled vaguely, most of them clad
hideously in utilitarian underwear. Among the
spectators, a tall, dark somebody looked spruce
and seasonable in green-tartan skirt, short, close-
fitting blue jacket, and velvet hat with pink roses
under the brim. The same belle, who trains her
glossy, wavy da,rk hair over her ears, shines at
evening shivoos in cunningly simple white frock,
trimmed with tiny longitudinal tucks, a twist of
purple ribbon-velvet round the waist, and cluster
of violets in the low-cut seamless bodice.
“A certain politician evidently really believes
in the levelling-up of the masses. One of his
housemaids is to be married shortly, and he intends
the ceremony to take place in a style equal to that
of his recently-wed daughter’s. He himself is
providing the wedding-feast, and his wife the
bride’s outfit and accessories. The members of
his family and their friends are going to wait on
the bridal-party at the wedding-breakfast, after
which the happy couple will depart to a fashion-
able hotel for a fortnight’s jaunt. What exalted
sphere will receive them on their return to every-
day life nobody knows ; but the ceremony is being
looked forward to as an immense joke by the
friends of the politician concerned. All the same,
if employers expended a little more sympathy on
their dependents, the eternal servant-question
would be well-nigh solved.
“ The Vic. marriage-market may be looking up,
but the educational world still seems very slack.
The daughter of a notable deceased public servant
with her mother called upon a titled lady the other
day in answer to an advt. for a nursery-governess:
duties, to teach a boy of eight, three hours a day ;
another little boy of six would occasionally run in
and out, but, of course, that wouldn’t count; pay,
255. ‘ A week ? ’ exclaimed the widow. ‘Oh, no:
a month, mother, ’ corrected the girl. ‘ A quarter,
you mean, ’ said her ladyship, in a ruffled tone.
‘ I think it quite enough to give ; it buys gloves
and things, and is a very nice way to amuse a
young lady in the morning.’ But someone else
got the place.

to extinguish her eloquent waist with padding. If
this'sort of she-boy impersonation became general,

improve the grace of their form divine. The

In a recent Windsor Magazine a tale, by
L. T. Meade, tells how one of the characters is to
go from Sydney to Albany (overland) to inspect
some mine. He would probably take the cable-
tram or a ferry-boat. The tale itself is more
poisonous than a “ Deadwood. ” One of the part-
ners in a big mining swindle turns “dog,” and
leaves Sydney for England to give his evidence.
The other partners buy a ship, which they sink
in mid-ooean in view of the mail-steamer, which,
of course, rescues the crew. The captain of the
derelict has a dog, which he is always beating.
The informer interferes to protect the dog, and is
bitten by the animal. He exhibits symptoms of
poisoning, and is finally saved by the doctor, who
discovers that one of the dog’s teeth was false and
filled with poison. Next!

Apropos the cabled fact that the Arch
bishop of Canterbury and bishops and many mem-
bers of both Houses of the Imperial Parliament,
as well as leading Nonconformists, intend to pro-
test against the Sunday publication of the London
Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail. When little
alphabetical Bailey, of Sydney, first visited
London, he called upon Stead and intro-
duced himself as “the originator of Sunday
journalism in Australia.” “You say you started
the first Australian Sunday paper?” said the
Maiden Tribute man. “Yes,” proudly answered
Bailey. “Then, sir,” exclaimed Stead, “you are
an enemy of the human race.”
Rumors that Archbishop Carr, of Mel-
bourne, was to be given a cardinal’s hat must
have been mere ignorant say-so. Australian
R.C.’s must be hungry for pomps if they want
two cardinals, for England has a solitary cardinal
(Vaughan); Catholic Ireland has only one;
America has contented itself with Card. Gibbons
(but Archbishop Ireland is to be elevated); and
France, an essentially R.C. country, possesses
only two. The “ hat ” is, perhaps wisely, re-
served as a rule for Italian prelates. Of the pre-
sent College, far below its limit of 70 members, 24
cardinals reside at the Vatican, and the remain-
der are mostly distributed over Italy. A more
likely man than Dr. Carr for the coveted head-
gear is Archbishop Redwood, of M.L.
People begin to say that if a certain
Governor doesn’t leave off drinking, Parliament
in his province will be opened some day by an
Excellency in the horrors. And that Excellency
will be trying to brush imaginary cockroaches off
the Speech from the Throne, and will thereby
bring the vice-regal office into even worse con-
tempt than it is in at present.
Anglican Bishop Green, of Armidale, re-
cently took lessons in ploughing. Believing that
a sound body should go with a sound mind, he
doffed coat and gaiters, and strode over the fur-
rows for the better part of a month. But many a
man who stalks abroad to find a sound body to
match his mind should stay at home and inquire
whether it isn’t his mind that wants levering.
Bobkeb Smith, who went ’Oine Bishop
and came back Archbishop, received the latter
title, not because he is Primate of Australia, but
because he is boss-bishop of N.S. W. The deter-
mination of the Synod was that “ the metropoli-
tan of each ecclesiastical province now in existence
shall be designated Archbishop.” So that any
other Australian metropolitan bishop is entitled
to ask Lambeth Conference to give him rank as
Archbishop.
“General” Booth was asked, the other
day, how it came that he had abjured the military
cap and taken to a pot-hat. Explained in reply
that the expansion of the Army’s concerns de-
manded a bigger tile, as they couldn’t all be
crowded under the little cap of previous days. . .
The change is significant. It indicates unerr-
ingly the transformation of the one-time prole-
tarian apostle into a propertied prince among
devil-dodgers.
Significant that that awful failure, Theo-
dore Unmack, started the anti-Federation cam-
paign in the Land of the Leper. Theodore
Unmack is the slow, stupid German who once
held Cabinet rank under Griffith, but was per-
emptorily dropped by M‘llwraith at the Coalition.
He is an aged and sad and disappointed man, who
was kicked out of the Ministry and Parliament so
suddenly that he never quite recovered his bal-
ance. As a politician he was mainly distinguished
for his advocacy of “ten bob a week ” as a fair
wage for the average artisan. Theodore is a fine
advt. for Federation. Any cause that he objects
to must be democratic.
The row started by Madden, M.L.A., re
the method in which David Syine acquired his
Mt. Maeedon property 30 long years ago, and the
alleged exorbitant price which Govt, paid for
it when it bought the place for His Ex.’s summer
residence about a generation back, still simmers.
Judge Williams has been appointed a Royal Com-
mission to look back into the buried years and
find out if the Age autocrat really did the square
thing or not. But supposing any Commission
appointed by the Vic. Govt, presumed to find
that D. Syme had not done the square thing—
well, would the man who owns Victoria take it in
a peaceful spirit, or would he rush out and get
measured for a new Government forthwith ? Can
any Vic. Govt, afford to find that D. Syme ever
did anything wrong ?
Strange that whilst Graham Berry’s little
shop in the suburbs was continually thrown in his
teeth after he had taken his grip in politics, the
smaller shop of his opponent, “ Jimmy ” Service,
was forgotten. But Service began in a very small
grocery on Emerald Hill, now South Melbourne,
and ran it into a big business, making there the
foundation of his fortune. The queer-looking,
prison-like, bluestone house ho then built still
stands in what is now a laborers’ neighborhood.
It was thought to be a palace in “ Jimmy’s ” day.
Berry made the mistake of dropping his grocery,
but the pawky Service stuck to business, and it
grew with him, and was good to him in his old
days. Berry lived to be Victoria’s biggest
politician, Service lias died its biggest grocer.

new lights said lie supposed Mr. Gardner would
not take a lutli on the Sabbath. Gardner quickly
interjected “ I would not! ” Of course the news-
papers gibed at him, but he disdained to explain
that he only referred to a dip in the briny, which
he regarded as amusement.
Madame Rudalyski is in a bad way at
Pentridge. Almost stone-deaf, and with badly-

form J;he ordinary duties of looking after her cell,
and last week in carrying out her bedclothes —
they don’t have much in Pentridge, either—she
collapsed and fell. At present it iooks very likely
that Radalyski will be released long before her 10
years a.re served—if not by the State on the ground
of ill-health, then by the Finisher of all sentences.
Tim Quinlan, Westralian M.L.A., recently
made a Chevalier of the Papal Order of St. Syl-
vester, was lately “ elevated ’ to that dignity at
Perth R.C. Cathedral. A local report states
that —
The uniform worn on the occasion was of a gorgeous
nature —comprising a large capello, adorned with a cock-
ade and feathers, scarlet jacket with epaulets, cream-
colored trousers with a gold stripe, high boots, and gilt
spurs. There is also the medal of the order, and a large
gold and enamelled medal suspended by a gold necklet,
and a magnificently burnished sword and scabbard, with
pearl and gold mountings. During the ceremony, the
Bishop having presented the sword, the recipient thrice
cleft the air with it, and, after the spurs had been ad-
justed, he was dubbed knight by the presiding pontiff.
There were also the prayers usual on such an occasion.
One good turn deserves another. It was the
self-same Tim who headed, with .£5O, the list of
subscriptions for a gift to the Bishop on the latter
setting forth upon the journey to Rome from
which he returned with Tim’s ehevaliership.
The “ mystic faith-healer, “Dr. Edwards,”
from Australia, recently arrested in Paris for
alleged fraud, is, it seems, identical with a man
well known on this continent. Arriving in Mel-
bourne in 1885, he was engaged as glove-fitter by
n leading softgoods firm, his name then being
Ldouardo Geisinardo. He was so clever at his
business that the glove-operations of his employers
grew by leaps and bounds. Then he took a shop
of his own, where his effective personality drew a
large business : a luxuriance of wavy hair, dark,
piercing eyes, and splendid Italian features
attracted the fair sex of Melbourne to his Glove
Boudoir.” Then he disappeared suddenly, and
was arrested at Albury for fraudulent insolvency.
He disgorged the money found on him, and pro-
mised settlement of his debts. Another dis-
appearance, and an “electric healer,” Prof.
Richard by name, shone in Melbourne. He was
visited by a patient, who discovered him to be
Geismardo, the glove-man, and, as he had proved
a debt in insolvency, he claimed the intervention
of the assignee. Richard fled again, and came to
Sydney, where he ;.:ave exhibitions of his “ healing
power by electricity.” He has now, it wquld
seem, bleached his jet black hair. The man who
now represents himself as St. Paul arisen from
the dead is no other than the clever Italian
glove-fitter.

Dear Bulletin.— Sydney Evening News oritio, com-
menting on Brady’s “ Ways of Many Waters,” and com-
paring Brady’s work with Kipling’s -in fashion—takes
occasion to observe “ Kipling, who can only be said to
have touched at one or two Australian cities, has in a few
lines given a picture of inland Australia which not one
of the many Australian poets ... has been able to do .
“ We read of the English skylark,
Of the spring in the English lanes :
But we screamed with the painted lories
As we rode on the dusty plains.
Every old bushman recognises the picture and wonders
how the devil the fellow wrote it.”
If the infallible NEWs-mun’s tin-joss had written :
I suppose the News man would have “ recognised the
picture” and it would have stirred the bush instinct in
him to the depths; and the second picture would have
been about as typically-Australian as the first. The
writer has “ ridden on the dusty plains ’’—which Kipling
never saw—but he has met no lories. If he had, he
couldn’t have screamed with them, because the lory is
not a screaming parrot. He is a comparatively quiet,
cold-country bird, and his habitat is rather the “ chilly-
mountains” than the “ dusty plains.” Have shot lories
in the timber—between Appin and Bulli, about St
George’s Basin, in Burragorang, all along the Blue Moun-
tains west to Bathurst, around Blayney, and elsewhere
but cannot remember meeting them in the fiat oountry.
They may have been there ; perhaps the News man has
seen them—if he knows the difference between a galah
and a lory but I haven t, and none of the old bushmen
I have interrogated on the subject have, either.

“ E.N.” : Have heard of an extraordinary
freak of nature in the shape of an aboriginal man
minus any apparent head, and having a small hole
about where the base of the neck should be,
through which he took in food and drink. The
tribe to whioh he belonged repeatedly tried to
make a head grow on him ; until, at last, exasper-
ated at failure, coupled with certain visitations of
bad luck which were attributed to their ill-formed
tribesman, they resolved to hold a religious cor
robboree at which the headless man should be
sacrificed on a sacred rock situated at the foot of
what is now called Lennox Head, about 12 miles
from Richmond River Heads. A great gathering
took place on the day appointed, and after certain
leligious exercises had been gone through, the
headless man was hurled over the cliff so that he
tell upon the sacred rock far below—and was
smashed up instead of suddenly developing a
head, as the tribe had anticipated. Great rejoic-
ings, however, followed, the curse being now sup-
posed to be removed from the tribe. Some of
those who came to the Richmond River district in
the early days knew this human monstrosity and
often gave it food—or said they did.

“ Yarrum ” on cruelty in the bush :
At a dairyman’s place recently came upon something
that made me weak. Bov was skinning calf on one side
of a gate, and cow (mother) bellowing and moaning
piteously on other. Fellow cut off a leg for pig, one for
the dogs, another for the house ; and threw balance over
the gate, with the remark to the cow—“ Here you !
You ought to get some of it.” Most of our dairy fanners
practically offer their sons a premium for cruelty by
agreeing that “ the boys” shall get all the calf-skins for
pocket-money.” Result—calf can’t look a bit “off-
color ” without being forthwith “ knocked on the head,”
and the hide whipped off. Specially the case before a
race meeting. At “ encampment ”or “show time,” also,
skinned poddies can be seen about the paddocks as thick
as mushrooms after rain.

Dear Bulletin.— ln answer to “E.C.K.,”
the tiger-snake, as its specific name ( curtus) im-
plies, is a short snake, about 3ft. 6in. being its
average length, though in rare instances it may
attain oft. Varies in color from silvery-grey to
coppery-brown, and appears in seven different
colors, though its unique scale-arrangement (body-
scales in 18 rows anteriorly, and 19 posteriorly
with anal and sub-caudal shields entire) is persis-
tent. The T.S. is ovo-viviparous, and highly

Bimble : I have a kangaroo of curious
tastes. Caught him when the drought was at its
worst—not a blade of grass to be seen. Fed him
on bread-and-water for a time, but he will eat
meat (raw or cooked), oatmeal porridge, sardines
dried apples, boiled rice, almost anything that
comes along, in fact. He is a whale on treacle-
pudding, and can pick a bone as clean as a dbg
can. If it doesn’t soon rain I shall have to
destroy him, as he is becoming rather an expensive
boarder.

“Ballarat”: In answer to “D.B.” (B.
29/4/’99), the best corrective of Barcoo vomit is
the avoidance of fatty foods. “ The Vagabond ”
has left it on record that the fryingpan has killed
more bushinen than the rum-bottle. Fat is a
strong component of all out-back diet, except
‘whitey.” Even “brownie” has fat as a chief
ingredient. The Filipinos live in a far deadlier
climate than the Barcoo-men, -but, by living on
rice, fish, and fruit, escape this vomiting sickness,
whereas the invading Americans were afflicted
badly therewith. Writer has kept sea-sickness at
bay by eating nothing - , the day before sailing, but
soda-biscuits (bile corrective) and fruit, and giving
a wide berth to ship-stews when on board.
x * * * *
“ K.D.L.” : “ D.B.” (B., 24/4/’99) errs in
calling that way-back malady “Barcoo vomit.”
It has always been known as the “ Belyando,”
“ Barcoo ” being the name for sores on the hands
caused by bites of flies fresh off carrion. The
“ Belyando ” was supposed to be caused by the
emanations from rank grass, or from “ penny-
royal ” and other strong-smelling herbs. Best
remedy is a table-spoonful of Lea and Perrins’,
taken immediately after meals.

“F.” : Heard a swaggy offer to bet drinks
he could make a fly empty a box of matches. The
bet was made, and swaggy had ’em easy. Cateh-
lng a fly, he held it by the wings between his fore-
finger and thumb, and allowed its legs to touch
the head of a match in a round box of vestas, when
the insect clung to it (the match), and, the opera-
tor lifting his hand, the fly pulled the match out.
In this way the box was emptied.
E.D.” : The majestic he-goat never re-
ceives sufficient credit for his extraordinary
intelligence. Served my time as a small boy >
in a township that was simply a goat-run
carrying about 250 animals to the acre, and
could fill pages with anecdotes demonstrat-
ing the superior mental attributes of goats.
Was the proud possessor of a large, adult
male doctored and set apart as a saddle-
hack, and that goat, after long experience
as a garden thief, developed an amazing
diplomacy. He would prise out the bottom
of a paling, enter the garden and eat his fill,
and after leaving would carefully replace the
paling, butting it into position. Experience
taught him that the paling would be secured
again if the opening were left obvious, and
that would have involved the trouble of
making another break when next he visited
that particular cabbage patch. At first he
was trapped a few times through over-
indulgence, beings so blown out that he
could not negotiate the opening; but he
was not such a goat as to fail to profit by
this adventure, and afterwards always modi-
fied his appetite to suit the available aper-
ture. Saw him more than once trying the opening
after a debauch ; if the fence fitted him tightly he
left; if there was still some slack he had another
go at the vegetables. He was then 15 years old,
and would have been alive yet, I believe, but for
a disagreement he had about a carrot with one of
the elephants in a travelling circus.

“ J.A.P.” : Apropos “ Swaggie’s ” lament
in recent Bulletin re the Westralian working-
man denouncing Asiatics, yet employing them
whenever a penny can be saved thereby. At
Cooktown, a few weeks ago, a large party of
Southern miners, bound for Papua, abused the
local residents for voting against the Labor-candi-
date. But they, the miners aforesaid, hired
Chinese to carry their swags to the wharf, at
Chinese prices, while the white carriers looked on.
After all, isn’t the doctrine of cheapness uni-
versal?

“L.S.”: Was camped once with a party
of bullockies, one of whom, a silent man, took no
part in the tough yarns going round until all the
rest had lied themselves to a standstill. Then,
however, he took a turn. “ I have had good
‘hides’ in my time. In fact, I owned the only
ones that ever buried themselves ‘snigging.’
Whenever a tough job was on I was always called
upon, and one day old M‘Fadden sent for me to
shift an ironbark tree from a ridge he was going
to build on. So I yokes-up 18; slings on best
‘jewellery’; hooks on to tree half-way up;
straightens ’em out nicely ; calls ’em to me ; gee’s
them off, an’ down they goes to it. All of a
sudden I hears a tremendous rumbling and rolling,
and remembers no more until I finds myself half-
a-mile away, half-buried in pebbles. You see,
that tree had such a big tap-root that them bul-
locks had pulled that there ridge right over and
buried themselves to all eternity.”

“ W.T.S.” : Once saw an out-back publi-

two buckets of water. Got full-up on the mixture

“ W.F.” : Quite true that the ordinary
green bullfrog can be trained and made a useful
cockroach-trap, if nothing else. Have one in our

“ 5.,7. ” on the scenery-advt curse :
He “ the monotony of dull, drab, Australian scenery.”
The sign -painter is now abroad, and Australian scenery is
fast being cured of its monotony. From Broken Hill to
Balmain ; from Annidale to Albury—everywhere you go
—not dead-green but raw-blue and flaring-reds, relieved
with white or yellow letters, give you such prods in the
eye that you are glad to turn to the dull drabs and greens
for relief. The foreshores of Sydney harbor have been
brutalised by the soulless shopkeeper, who is now hard at
work dauhing-over the wfiiole country : one firm I know
of has no less than six men on the road with paint-pots.
Up to now I have not heard of Mt. Kosiuscko and the
Jenolan Caves being “beautified,” but I believe
Premier Reid has only to have his attention called to the
matter, and he will put on an army of men to paint all
N.S. Wales red, blue and yellow, and obtain a big surplus
from the revenue derived by letting out the country in
advertising blocks. Australian scenery is being de-
monotonised with a vengeance.

“Shaker” : Since
Govt, began to interest it-
self in his affairs, the N.Q.
aboriginal finds himself in a
tight place bstween his own
tribal law, which he under-
stands and must obey, and
the white man’s law, which
he regards as incompre-
hensible and rather ridi-
culous. Circumstances arise
under which tribal law ab-
solutely compels him to bash
some other nigger, or per-
haps to defend himself
against some other fellow,
similarly forced to bash him.
Then the white’s law takes
the top dog in hand, and
hangs or gaols him, accord-
ing to the measure of suc-
cess with which he has vin-
dicated the righteousness of
his cause. Such cases are
now before the local courts
almost every week.

“ Burragorang” on aboriginal mourning:—
I remember, when 8 years old, seeing a black gin, whose
eldest son had died, chop her head into the bone, With
an iron tomahawk, in six or eight places, so that the
blood ran down in rivulets, and then besmear her head
with a mixture of white pipeclay, matting the hair
together in six big tallow-candle-like divisions, ail the
time keeping up a weird wail. For a month afterwards
she went about in this ghastly headgear. In eases of
'STJESg
completely cover the head with a mass of plastic
pipeclay, which clay skull-cap was worn day and
night for a moon, and was then removed with much
pain and loss of hair. This mourning-cap was preserved,
and carried from place to place under cover; and to it
unquestionably attached a deep and undehned sanctity.
It was the holy of holies-something altogether too
mysterious and sacred to be spoken of, much less defiled
by touch. In case of tribal war, to obtain this holy skull-
cap was the enemy’s ambition, and to defile this sacred
emblem before the eyes of the vanquished was revenge
sublime to the dusky warriors of 60 .years ago. These
sacred skull-caps were very rare in N.S.W. ; and to-day
not one is to be he found in any Australian Museum. In
the British Museum (of course !) there is one from N.s.
Wales, and another is in the Berlin Museum. Can any
Bulletin reader let me know if any of these pipe-clay
mourning-caps can be met with in Australia? And, if
so, where ?

Queensland has raised another horror
~ ~ n ~
which, in its humble way, runs the Gatton grue-
someness very close. About four months ago a
man, working on a ringbarking contract at a
station near Yuelba, died and was buried close to
his own hut. His wife and three daughters (aged
13 ) 15 a ,nd 17), having no other means of support,
decided t G finish the contract themselves. They
gged away at it till, between hard toil, sun-

is in the blood of the bushman and bushwoman,
they all went mad together. Then the eldest girl,
apparently the worst case of the lot, fled into the
bush. She W as found after several days, still
a jj ve but na ked, partly eaten by ants, and howl-
ing a wild a^nal the tl 4s, an ’ d she died
? oon a her the discovery. The body was taken
home to the hut where the other three demented
frameworks _ the mother and two sisters-were
doing their little howl at nothing in particular.
There is a most beautiful postscript to the daily-
aC£Jounts of this horror-a postscript
which, if it is quite true, ranks high as a
case of Thrift It is to the effect that there was
money due to the four insane wrecks on their ring-
barking contract, but the manager didn’t give it
to them because, in their deranged condition,
they didn’t know the value of cash. They might
have wasted in frivolity, or spent it on large,
garish feather-hats unsuited to their station. So
the f our lunatics just went on starving and ring-
barking—they were sane enough to ring-bark but
too mad to be allowed to spend money—till the
adventure of the nude sister who was partly eaten
by ants drew attention to them.

W hen Sir Charles Hollcd-Smith, iniliTfffy

Hoad, assistant adjutant-general, being ap-

that he was senior to that, officer. To pre-

815 GEORGE STREET, SYDNEY
(nearly opposite Railway Station).
Business, Robbery, etc.
In Mt. Gambier their lives a man who was once
young and ambitious and a butcher. When he set up for
himself his previous employers lay low for him. There
was a meat-famine in the town, but a drover was ex-
pected with 100 head of cattle, and the p.e’s conspired
with others to run up the bids when the beasts were
auctioned and “ let in ” the guileless youth for the lot at
a fancy price. But the g.y. got wind of it, rode a day’s
journey to meet the drover, and bought the mob off-
hand. Then he subsidised the man to take the cattle
into town and auction them on his (the youth’s) behalf in
the usual way. When the sale came on the conspirators
gaily ran the bidding up until their last bid was at least
twice the value of the stock. But the “chump,” who
had also been bidding recklessly for a time, would go no
further, and the take-downs found themselves in the
soup. No language could do justice to their feelings
when, upon going to the agent’s office to pay, they found
that the spoil wasn’t going to the drover but to their in-
tended victim.

A N.S.W. man died recently, leaving a matter
of £2OO cash behind him, the bulk of it in the Savings
Bank, the rest in another bank. His brother, going
across from Melbourne to prove the estate and collect the
money, was advised to put this very simple job in the
hands of a solicitor. Result, two bills from the indus-
trious shark—two long documents setting forth three
dozen items, or so, and culminating in a grand total of 18
guineas to pay : 18 guineas for transferring the dead
man’s bank credits to his brother in Victoria. The
charges included such lines as Is. 6d. for parchment, but
the necessary tape was thrown in gratis.

A new development in Sydney is the soi-discint

The clever American ! This is the saving
machinery: “Dictated D.8.J., typed F.S.” As D.B.J.
and F.S. are soulless 30-bob-per-week retainers, what
easier than to make each swear black is white and “cleri-
cal error” when the “ boss’s ” interest is involved ?

This should be about a seven years’ record in
going broke. In ’9l adjudicated insolvent; in ’93 com-
pounded with creditors; same year, adjudicated insol-
vent ; in ’97 compounded again ; ’9B, adjudicated in-
solvent. The hero, a breezy person who used to encourage
the belief that he was a baron at the least, is now described
merely as an agent; he used to talk airily of family
estates in foreign parts, too, but even that bubble'now is
pricked. The S.A. courts have been favoured with his
business lately ; but his troubles began elsewhere, years
ago.

A certain Govt, department decided to dispose
of a quantity of second-hand building material, and in-
structions were accordingly given to have a sale effected,
terms cash. One “ lot ” was knocked down to a man
from a distant suburb, who dropped in to the auction too
late to hear the terms announced, and unprepared to
comply with them, as it happened. Not to get prompt
delivery of his purchase would mean considerable trouble
and some expense to him, and on representing this to the
auctioneer, to whom he was well and favorably known,
and promising to square up when next he came to town,
he was cheerfully allowed to take the things away. This

lorty years ago Chilian flour played an im-

se days the captains of the ships were usually part
owners—with complete control of their cargoes. There
were little syndicates then—mostly of chapel men. It fell
ic on a. Sunday. A hymn was being sung when a young
man entered the church and, approaching one of the
aeacons, whispered something in his ear and then left.
Ihis deaoon went to the sitting of the other deacon-said
omething to him and both departed. The hymn was over
ana the minister had begun his sermon, when the two
deacons re-entered. One took his seat the other
marched up to the pulpit and handed a note to the
minister, who paused in his sermon to read it. Having
read it, the rev. gentleman gave a pleasing nod to the
deacon, who immediately left the building. The congre-
gation wondered, and it was not known for years what
cnat dote contained. It was revealed bv chance and was
something like this : “ Chilian vessel sighted. If I take a
steamer and run out to her I will be ahead of the pilot and
get her to dodge about till midnight, so as not to trade on
the .Lord s Day. Will then buy at best price and get
captain to sign contract. Give a nod and I’ll know that
as usual you will be good for one-third of the venture.”

Patrick Jones is a notorious pedestrian financier
and shows talent in his walk of life worthy of a land-
banker in the boom-days. During the construction of
the Jerilderie-Berrigan line, Paddy and five other noto-
nous foot-passengers were humping “bluey” to Berrigan

gammg a rise in the road they saw a number of picks and
shovels (the morning had been wet and- the men were not
« orking). Also they saw a hawker’s cart coming about a
m . l *® away. A brilliant idea then struck Paddy : “ Off
with yer coats an’ git to it!” he ordered, pointing to the
Tlle . mates , lo °ked mystified, but, having much
confidence in Patrick’s resourcefulness, obeyed without
questioning, and Paddy began strutting before them with
some dignity. The hawker drew up and spoke of his
wares, and Patrick bought largely in clothes, pipes, and
tobacco and gave the hawker an order on the paymaster
ot the line. “Do your men want anything ? ” asked the
merchant. Patrick turned to his mates and thundered :
JNow then, you men. I’ll give you ten minutes to’ get
anything you want ! ” “ Are they O.K. ?” whispered the
‘‘Oh, yes,” said Patrick sagely ; “ they’re all
right. The men also took large supplies, and gave

ponce are looking for those six walking financiers to this

us no surprise. As a matter of fact, the Society earns its

“F.C.” on the troubles of certain bank-
olerks :
. Half-an-hour in a suburban branch of Melb. Sav-
ings Bank the other morning much enlightened me
as to why clerks in such establishments are worried-
looking and prematurely grey and bald. A perspiring
middle-aged woman, with three small youngsters, bustled
in. One infant immediately climbed on to the only
vacant chair, another “occupied” the small writing
table, while the third was planted by his mother on the
counter. Said mother next pounced on a towel supposed
to tig for the exclusive use of the clerks, and having
therewith wiped her own placid brow, proceeded to
remove the outer stratum of dirt from the hands of the
counter-seated infant. After having a wipe at the other
two offspring, she blandly enquired of the cashier—
“ You haven’t a brush and comb handy, have you
Mister?” “No,” answered that paralysed youno- man’
grimly ; “ it’s not usual for depositors to perform their
toilets in the bank.” Then he turned to another female
depositor, who, wishing to withdraw £3 10s., had carefully
filled up a cheque for £lOOO, following the exact wording
even to the name, of the sample posted up for general
instruction. The cashier sighed wearily. “My dear
madam, you don’t want to draw £lOOO. And you know
your name isn’t John Smith. Come now.” It would save
a lot of time if some of the customers could he taught the
meaning of the word “endorse,” and that it isn’t
necessary to cover the back of a cheque with address
occupation, and whether married or single. Curious
that the ordinary housewife should be so anxious to
proclaim that she is a married woman. With a sympa-
thetic or apparently-interested clerk women grow quite
confidential, telling him all about their goings and
comings and families, and sicknesses and deaths in said
families, even unto the third generation. An exception
however, is the real business woman, who runs some
small concern on her “ own,” or one who attends races
regularly (there are several in Melbourne living on that
game). These are closer than an oyster and as cute as
a monte-man. But they are few and far between.

A Dread Foo.
In uncivilised countries if a man makes an
enemy he has to be constantly on the qui vive
night and day lest his foe come upon him un-
awares and kill him. In this enlightened land ot
ours the law looks out that such things do not occur.
There are some things, however, that neither
civilization nor the law can prevent. Even to-
day an inoffensive citizen may be set upon sud-
denly and almost without warning by some dread
disease. Influenza is especially prominent at this
time of the year, and it sets N upon its victims in an
alarmingly sudden manner. It is in reality an
aggravated form of cold, supplemented by a
general weakness of the whole system, and may be
cured by Bile Beans at a cost of but Is. lyd. per
box. These 'Beans can be obtained at all chemists,
or direct from the Australian depfit, 39 Pitt-street,
Sydney. Six large boxes for 6s. Ordinary colds,
it is well-known, are caused by the congestion of
blood, which, as a rule, is most prominent in the
head or throat. Influenza can be traced to the
same cause, and irregular or insufficient liver
action is in most cases responsible for both.
When the liver, through any derangement of the
digestive organism, ceases to act in a proper man-
ner, a certain amount of bile finds its way into
the blood, and at the same time the blood created
from food consumed is of a decidedly poor quality.
In this manner the blood becomes congested, the
circulation sluggish, and a cold results. The cir-
culation of the blood now being much slower than
usual, the entire system is affected. The nervous
organism becomes unstrung, the appetite poor,
and the rest disturbed. The body is extremely
susceptible to chills, and the slightest draught
causes a violent attack of coughing or sneezing.
Many so-called cures for influenza fail to get at
the root of the trouble, and only afford temporary
relief. A medicine that will keep the liver in
thorough and regular working order, and the
digestion right, will, without doubt, prove the
most effective preventative and cure for influenza
and colds, and is also a remedy for biliousness,
indigestion, costiveness, insomnia, debility, piles,
female complaints, headache, and all kindred ail-
ments. Keep a box of Bile Beans handy, and you
need have no fears of foes of this character.
A Daring Urchin.
A smart youth (and there are a good many in
our town) the other evening, thinking to do some-
thing very cunning, refused to take a Bile Bean,
which would have cured him of his headache and
biliousness. For all stomach, bowel, and liver
troubles, Bile Beans are the remedy of the cen-
tury. Used a number of years in America by the
first physicians, they come to Australia with a
reputation that will soon place them head-and-
shoulders above the ordinary digestive and purga-
tive pills. The low price, Is. l|>d. per box, or six
large boxes for 6s., enables everyone to purchase
them. Ailments that are the direct result of
defective digestion and assimilation, such as
debility, constipation, dizziness, fulness after eat-
ing, and tired feeling on the slightest exertion,
pain in the back, hot sweaty hands, undue perspi-
ration, languor, loss of appetite, and general tone,
and a number of other minor symptoms, are all
cured by Bile Beans, if they are taken according
to direction. Remember, a stitch in time saves
nine, and, if you are a sufferer, do not be daring
and unconidncable, but take this great remedy,
which is the cheapest, to say nothing of the best,
in the world. They are made in Detroit, Michi-
gan, U.S. A., and are for sale by all Chemists, or
the Australian Depot, 19 Macquarie-place, Sydney.
Get the genuine. Each box bears the signature.
Gold Paved Sydney.
Farmers and people in the country who have
never visited the metropolis have some very queer
ideas of what Sydney really is. The yellow met-d
is not to be picked up in the streets ; and, in fact,
about the only yellow objects to be seen in our
thoroughfares are bilious individuals, who refuse
to use Bde Beans. Why, no one knows. Bile
Beans for Biliousness, Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, Face Pimples, Fullness after Eat-
ing, Buzzing in the Head, Belching Wind, Piles,
Female Weakness, White-faced Girls, Debility,
and Loss of Physical Tone are a specific that the
first American physicans have used in their prac-
tice for several years. The sale is in the millions
annually, and the laboratories and manufacturing
plants at Detroit, Michigan (E.S.A.), are about
the largest and best-equipped in the world. The
price is only thirteen-pence half-penny for a box,
so the poorest individual will be able to avail him-
self of the opportunity of being cured without
feeling the pull on the purse that medical attend-
ance usually causes.
A Pitt-street Sensation.
A REMARKABLE SHOOTING CASE AND
A PROMPT ARREST.
Considerable excitement was manifested in
Pitt-street just before noon to-day by the ap-
parently strange conduct of a portly old gentle-
man, who was observed to be careering along Pitt-
street, to the imminent danger of passers-by.
With hat in hand, he continued, followed by an
alarmed crowd, until his hurried progress was
arrested by the strong arm of the law, in the
person of Constable . When asked for an
explanation of his strange behavior, the old
geutleman confided to the constable that he had
been seized with shooting pains in the head and
body, and that he was merely hastening with all
speed to purchase a box of Bile Beans for Bilious-
ness, which would promptly arrest his ills.
Now, how many persons are there who have
been seized in a similar manner, and yet
have neglected to obtain that sure and safe
remedy, Bile Beans for Biliousness. The conse-
quence is they are almost constantly afflicted with
sick headaches, constipation, indigestion, piles,
and those almost countless complaints which
spring from a disordered liver. Between the liver
and the brain more sympathy exists than between
any two other organs of the human body. There-
fore, as a necessary consequence, when the liver
fails to effectually perform its natural functions,
the brain becomes a sufferer, sick headaches are
produced, numerous ills follow, and life practi-
cally becomes a burden. Man unconsciously asks
himself, “Howam I to rid myself of my misery?”
The answer is simple. Bile Beans for Biliousness
will assist the liver to perform its duties naturally
and thoroughly, and when this has been done,
goodbye to biliousness, headaches, piles, constipa-
tion, indigestion, sleeplessness, and such kindred
ills, proving how important arrests and punish-
ment sometimes come about.
A Search Party.
A party consisting of two individuals, who hap-
pened to be twin brothers, by the name of Bile
Beans, set out to make a search of the interior of
a lot of Sydney people. Bad liver’s actlon > c ° n *
stipation and indigestion, the result of hot
weather, was the cause of the exploration. Ihese
mild gentle, but searching small vegetable ex-
plorers are so thorough in their duties that when
their work is finished, well-drained, clean, whole-
some roads are the result. Bile Beans differ from
other remedies employed for a similar work in the
following ways : —
Their action is gentle, there is no griping,
purging and no evil after tiffects. Their formula
is purely vegetable, and such drastic ingredients
as aloes, calomel and mercury, as found in most
purgatives, are emphatically and positively not
employed, even in the smallest degree. Occasion
may come when you wish a medicine to thorough-
ly search out and get to the root of a digestive
ailment. If it does, remember Bile Beans are the
people’s popular-priced preparation, and they cure
when all other remedies fail. If you doubt the
fact, inquire amongst your friends, and see if you
cannot find someone who will give you ocular
demonstration of this fact. Thousands of Aus-
tralians have been made well, happy and strong
by this great remedy, and amongst your friends
you will most likely find the nfimes of some of
these thousands.
The Girl Who Blushes.
Blushes are of several varieties. There’s the
modest blush, the angry flush, the joyful blush,
and the shameful blush. Girls blush on all sorts
of occasions. Some of them are continually
blushing, while others never even so much as
have a decent colour. The girl that blushes is
generally pretty young, usually between 14 and
20, and she is then passing through possibly the
most critical part of her career. The organs
that compose her womanhood are at that time
assuming their proper proportions, and beginning
to fulfil their various functions. During this
period great care must be taken as to the
general health of the individual._ Pages upon
pages have been written upon this subject, and
yet we see everywhere pale, pasty-complexioned
girls whose looks and languid actions show
plainly the weakness of their entire system. At
this critical period the digestive organs must be
kept in thorough working order, and no waste
matter must be allowed to remain in the system.
Probably three-fourths of the derangements of
the female organs, from which so many women
suffer, are caused by the clogging, through the
presence of waste matter, of the ducts, or pipes,
immediately surrounding or connecting with the
several organs. Bile Beans for Biliousness are
essentially a medicine for the regulating of the
whole digestive system ; they clear off all waste
and impure substances, invigorate the liver,
purify the blood, and enliven the circulation.
Acting in this manner, they keep the delicate
organs of the body free from detrimental outside
influences, and consequently minimise the danger
that besets a girl just budding into womanhood.
Many a girl’s whole life has been marred by in-
sufficient care and attention at this time, and
again we would emphasise the fact that for this
sort of work there is no specific nearly so efficient
as Bile Beans for Biliousness. Young girls and
their mothers should remember this.
The Society Debutante.
When a young girl first enters society her imme-
diate sensations are those of attainment, triumph,
and elation. In the first flush of her social career
her imagination opens for her a long vista of
pleasures, whose brightness is unsullied by the
slightest shadow of care. Soon, though, the
novelty commences to wear off, and she finds that,
far from being a life of unalloyed pleasure, society,
I ; ke everything else, has its drawbacks. The
health must be kept up, or one becomes a back
number. For work of this kind there is no remedy
on the market equal to Bile Beans. Keeping the
entire system in a thorough state of cleanliness,
free from all waste and impure matter, toning up
the nervous organism, purifying the blood, and
keeping the female organs in regular and thorough
working order, they achieve what no other
medicine can do— i.e., a complete mastery over
all derangements of the body arising from over-
indulgence of any Sort. Late hours, rich food,
lack of exercise, &c., all bring on, more or less,
severe maladies, and then a course of Bile Beans
for Biliousness is what you need to put you right
again. Many women suffer untold miseries
through complaints peculiar to their sex, and in
the great majority of cases these disorders are due
to the presence of waste matter in the system.
Here again Bile Beans show their great worth, as
they cure all ailments of this sort in a speedy and
thorough manner. They are manufactured in one
of the largest and best-equipped laboratories in
the world at Detroit, U.S.A., and stand to-day
the most successful remedy ever introduced into
Australia. Their price places them within reach
of everyone, and no home can afford to be with-
out a box of this invaluable specific, whether the
owner be in society or not.
A Marvellous Scientific Dis-
covery.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY OUTDONE.
Scientists tell us that in this nineteenth, cen-
tury of ours about the greatest strides made in the
discovery world have been in medicine. We have
to record a discovery by an American medical
man of a certain vegetable substance that has the
effect on the digestive organs of nature’s own ani-
mal bile. This discovery is revolutionising all the
present methods of treatment for digestive ail-
ments. The old theory of pepsin, bismuth, starv-
ing, purging, etc., etc., is to be done away with.
This great vegetable substance is compounded
with other ingredients to facilitate the working,
and to-day this remedy can be purchased the
world over and in Australia under the name of
Bile Beans for Biliousness. This great remedy
posseses the peculiar properties of _ acting on
the bowels without purging or otherwise weaken-
ing the patient. This is because the substance
that relaxes the bowels has about the same
action as the natural bile. Bile Beans are purely
vegetable, and a course of them will probably suc-
cessfully oust the most chronic cases of Piles, In-
digestion, Headache, Biliousness, Female Ail-
ments, Debility, Constipation, and a host of other
ailments that owe their origin to defective bile
flow, assimilation, and poor digestion. These
Beans are placed on the market in a form that
anyone can take them without medical super-
vision ; and as the price is so very low, there are
few homes that cannot afford to always have a box
for emergency. Aus. Depot: 39 Pitt-st., Sydney.
Do We Live Unnatural Lives?
“ Yes ! ” would be the answer given in ninety-
nine cases out of every hundred, and to arrive at
this conclusion a great deal of thought is not
necessary. We only have to look around us and
see the thousands of people suffering, which goes
to prove that we do live unnatural lives. We dis-
obey the laws of Nature. We eat too fast, eat too
much, eat foods that disagree with us, eat at the
wrong time, keep late hours, and don t observe
regularity of habit, and the inevitable result is
that our health breaks down. Ofice in a while we
come across a man that has kept his digestion
good and his blood pure. That man has lived a
perfectly natural life. Not one man in a thousand
does it, though. But it is gratifying to know that
there is a remedy at hand—viz.. Bile Beans that
will cure our ills. Bile Beans have been used by the
first physicians in America for all ailments
arising from defective digestion, such as Bilious-
ness, Headache, Constipation, Piles, Pimples, Im-
pure Blood, Dizziness, Liver Troubles, &c. Bile
Beans act direct on the bile ducts, causing the
liver to secrete and cast increased quantities of
this fluid into the bowels, thus flushing the same
out as a stream of water would a drain. Bile
Beans are not an ordinary medicine. They are
manufactured in one of the largest and best
equipped laboratories in the world at Detroit,
Michigan, U.S.A., and they come to Australia
with a reputation that will undoubtedly score for
them a great success. In the course of a year
several millions of Beans are sold, and it is only
on this account that the proprietors are enabled
to sell at the low price, viz., Is. per box, owing
to the great cost of the ingredients. Obtainable
at all Chemists, or the Bile Beans Manufacturing
Co., 39 Pitt-street, Sydney. See that you get the
genuine.
Every Man for Himself.
The selfisnness of human nature is so marked
that the person who devotes his energies to the
promotion of the welfare of others is almost uni-
versally regarded as a crank. Men and women
need very little advice to help themselves to most
of the good things of the world, But, strange as
it may appear, they are surprisingly apathetic in
their efforts to procure the most valuable of all
human possessions—good health. Once this has
been lost a dire misfortune befalls the loser, and
lucky, indeed, is the individual who has it restored
to him. The best way, then, to provide against
the possibility of such a misfortune occurring is to
secure the proper and thorough discharge of the
natural functions of those organs which regulate
the health of the human body. The liver,
stomach, and kidneys are those organs. If
they are in an efficient state of working,
good health will be the natural result. But they
are liable to impairment and occasionally need
assistance. In such eases Bile Beans for Bilious-
ness have been proved over and over again to be
the best and most effective assistant obtainable.
Almost all human ailments arise from an impaired
digestive organism, and thousands of valuable
lives are yearly sacrificed thereby. But the bane
ful effects of any impairment of the digestive
system are removed by Bile Beans for Biliousness,
the greatest medical discovery of the nineteenth
century.
The Wreck of the Loch Sloy.
The wreck of the Lock Sloy, and the loss of
almost the entire ship’s company has attracted
attention to the dangers of sea-faring life. The
sufferings and privations endured by the few
survivors, as related by them since their
rescue, have evoked the sympathy of the
whole Australian public. It is matter for con-
gratulation that we have but few such terrible
disasters occurring on our coasts. But unfor-
tunately we have sufferings equally as acute, en-
dured by our landsmen every day, and notwith-
standing that Bile Beans for Biliousness are at
hand to relieve the great majority of those suffer-
ings, this valuable remedy is permitted by some
misguided sufferers to pass unnoticed. When the
liver, stomach and kidneys become deranged they
inflict the greatest misery, as those organs are the
main regulators of the health of the human body.
When those organs become impaired they give
rise to indigestion, constipation, and the almost
countless kindred ills which so frequently make
life a burthen. It is for ills such as these that
Bile Beans for Biliousness have been specially
prepared, and their efficacy has been proved in
thousands of cases in our midst. Bile Beans will
cure the most chronic cases of indigestion, consti-
pation, sick and nervous headaches, and the
numerous ailments which result from an impaired
digestive organism. They are sold by all
chemists and storekeepers, and the low price of
13Jd. per box should place them within the
reach of all. They are also an undoubted specific
for colds, influenza, dizziness, female weaknesses,
irregularities, bad breath, piles, loss of energy,
lack of physical tone, and that ired feeling. The
Australian Depot is at 39 Pitt-street, Sydney. If
a course of Bile Beans be taken by any sufferer
from the ills occasioned by a deranged digestive
organism they will restore him to health and re-
move the possibility of one more being added to
the many wrecks in our midst.
The Way to Win a Lady’s Love.
A good deal has been said lately in the woman’s
columns of this paper as to the best way to win
the affection of the gentler sex. An old, experi-
enced hand at the business says that the first
essential is good nature and good spirits, coupled
with a manly physique. Bile Beaus are the
specific to use to attain this end. They put the
digestive organs in perfect condition, aid the
liver, heart, lungs’ action, act as a tonic to the
whole system ; and for such ailments as piles,
costiveness, indigestion, sour stomach, debility,
and lack of energy and physical tone they will
prove an undoubted specific. Sold at Is. lid. per
box, or six large boxes for 6s., they are within the
reach of all. They are manufactured in one of
the best-fitted and equipped laboratories in the
world, at Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., and the
fact that they are prescribed by the first physicians
in that country proves that they are a medicine of
no ordinary merit. Obtainable at all chemists, or
the Australian depot, 39 Pitt-street, Sydney.
Oarry a few beans in your vest pocket, and if you
feel out of sorts take one. They will put you
right.

Premier Kingston postpones the opening
of S.A. Parliament until Thursday, June 22
two days after N.S.W. Federal Referendum.
The monotonous brick which Premier
Kingston’s Tory detractors aim at him is not that
he is less democratic than they are, but that he is
less democratic than he pretends to be. In reply,
he points out that he has estab-
lished the State Land Bank,
the graduated land-tax on
large estates, the absentee tax,
the system of resuming large
estates for closer settlement,
created a labor bureau and
a system of village settle-
ments, abolished “the at-
tachment of wages for
debt, passed an improved
Health Act, and intro-
duced the Referendum—
not by statute, for the
Council stood in the
way, but at least by
precedent. Also, he
would have passed an
Employers’ Liability
Act but for the Coun-
cil’s obstruction ; and
he promises to try his
hand at State Fire
Insurance and the
creation of Elective
Ministries, and, if pos-
sible, to absolutely stop
the sale of State Lands.
And the unprogressive Tory
still complains that Kingston
isn’t progressive enough.
Premier Reid has now his
third Vice-President of N.S.W.
Leg. Council: W. H. Suttor—
Graham—Hughes. By the way,
where the occupant of the office
is so often changed the S.M.

the official, give his name with
or without his office and not
“the Vice-President of the Leg.
Council ” said this or that. Seven
readers out of ten don’t know who the V.P. is.
Provincialists yell that the atrocious
Federal Bill permits the same men to be members
of the Federal and State Parliaments, and to
draw therefore double salaries, thus making the
trade of “the professional politician” doubly
lucrative. But no man can sit either in a State or
Federal House unless he is elected by his people,
and if the people find that the double arrange-
ment is a calamity (supposing any politician tries
it), they needn’t elect the same man to both Par-
liaments. The remedy is quite in their own hands.
The announcement that ex - Premier
MTlwraith has despatched a letter to Queens-
land advising electors there to vote against the
Commonwealth Bill strikes like a voice from the
dead—or the gaol. Thomas is still comparatively
a young man—64—and his half-dozen goes at
ministerial office placed him well in the front of
Q. public opinion, but the obstinate illness which
prevented him personally going to Brisbane to
rout the enemies who lately assailed him v/ill be
certain to damage the value of his postbag forget-
me-not.
When the Westralian nigger is indentured
to his kind boss, the squatter (the police cap-
ture him, and then the squatter J.P.
gives him the alternative of being inden-
tured quite of his own free will, or doing
an endless series of gaol sentences for
continuous vagrancy), he isn’t a slave.
This point can’t be too strongly insisted
on. He gets no pay, receives any
clothes or food his boss likes to give
him, is worked any hours his boss
pleases, is flogged occasionally (boss
occasionally fined £2 if the law hap-
pens to hear of the matter), and is
gaoled if he tries to run away. But
any disreputable, lying ruffian who
says the W.A. nigger is a slave
deserves to be held up to the
scorn of all honest nigger-
dr i vers.
There is much specu-
lation as to whether the
new S.A. Assembly will
regard the decision of the
people on Household Suf-
frage as final. Darling,
now practically Opposi-
tion leader, intimated his
intention last session of
voting for the measure if
the electors favored it;
and Homburg, another
prominent Tory M.P.,
when similarly asked,
said, “Most emphati-
cally, Yes.” The people
decided in its favor by a
majority of 15,000, and if
these Oppositionists stick
to their pledges there will be a big majority for
franchise reform in the new Parliament.
Ex-Agent-General Playford, just back to
S.A. Assembly after five years’ absence, first
entered Parliament in ’GB. He .has been twice
Premier, and has had an aggregate of 3550 days
in office. The Tories are most anxious to persuade
Playford to throw in his lot with them, but King-
ston, who is always faithful to his friends, cannot
believe that Tom will “ turn dog.”
S. A.- Assembly, as re-elected last month,
consists of 12 Labor members, five Ministers, and
a Whip, 14 other Govt, supporters, three Inde-
pendents (Glynn, Playford, and Paech), and 18
Oppositionists, who, however, decline to follow
Downer, except spasmodically. The Speaker
makes the 54 members complete.. The Ministry’s
prospects of continued life are even better than
after last triennial election.
Premier Seddon’s offer of a regiment of
Maoriland troops and a steamer for service in
Samoa (regiment contemptuously declined, but
steamer accepted without effusive gratitude) isn’t
quite on a par with the great Soudan fizzle, though it
lookslikeit. TheM.L. peopiehavelonghad ayearn-
ful hope that Britain will annex Samoa and hand
it over to Maoriland, and that the latter will
ultimately become the head of a great South Sea
confederation. So Digger Dick tried to get his
oar in with a view to business rather than to grovel.
But Britain reckoned there were already sufficient
complications in Samoa.
AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE.
“ Ratty ole bloke that, Jimmy,
surges awful if yer just shot
a few rocks at ’im ”-.
Which, being translated, means:
“Eccentric person that,
James; becomes enraged if
stones art thrown at him.”
Westebn Mail (Perth) is oi
opinion that Westralia shouldn’t
federate because if it sends eleven
good men to the Commonwealth Par-
liament there won’t be enough left be-
hind to form a decent State Govt. Which deafen-
ing cry of “ stinking fish 5 ’ is rather a surprise.
It is a remarkably modest province which is
prepared to say that it can’t raise eleven moder-
ately intelligent politicians and still have one or
two left oyer.
Interesting item from Thursday Island
Forty Japs, landed here (May 8) by the steamer Yawatu
Maru, all being provided with passports. All the afternoon
the shipping-officer was busy signing them on to Japanese-
owned boats. The white pearlers are indignant that the
Japs, can indent lab'or while they are denied the privi-
lege. Complain, further, that they are unable to get
labor locally. . . . This item simply confirms a recent
Bulletin assertion that the Queensland treaty-restric-
tions on Jap. immigration apply to unindented labor only.
HOSPITAL SATURDAY: RIVALS!!
“ Better come ’ome , Bill; weain’t got no ’ope! ”
The weekly leper begins to make a hole in
Q. Treasury. Govt, arranged with the China co’s
boat, which was taking a cargo of lepers from
Sydney to pick two up from a Northern port.
Passage-money- paid in advance—,£2so ; with
.£lO for each man when he stepped ashore. When
the boat arrived, only one man was shipped, the
others having left unobtrusively for parts un-
known. The passage-money was, of course, for-
feited.
The most specious Geebung argument is—
“ Defeat this Bill and get a better.” Better in
which way? More democratic in order to secure
the support of tho Leg. Council, or more reaction-
ary to get the Laborists on its side ? The amend-
ment must tend one way or the other. Shall we
let the two sections pull the structure to pieces in
order to re-build it, when each of them will seek
to do so in a way which, in the eyes of the other,
will make it tenfold worse ?
Ex-Treasurer W. M'Millan, on returning
from England, paid back into N.S.W. Treasury
tlie Parliamentary salary which had accrued in
his absence. This is worthy of remembrance at a
tune when nominally holding an office is con-
sidered the same as performing the duties of it.
vl ill, for instance, ex-Attorney-General Want pay
back the money which accrued as salary while he
was so far away from N.S.W. as to confessedly not
know anything about its greatest topic of politi-
cal discussion ?
Queensland enthusiasm for Federation is
on the rise in the bakbiox. The Western men, not
oaring a rap for the supremacy of Brisbane,
Rockhampton or Townsville, and regarding these
cities very often as parasites on bakbiox industry,
are not particularly concerned to see their im-
portance (real or fancied) slightly diminished by
the Federal movement. The affection of Q. bush-
men for the coast towns is a very slender thread
indeed. They have much more Australian feeling
about them than provincial.
“Is it likely," asks John Haynes, “that
the State Parliaments will reduce their numbers'?
Do politicians,’' lie triumphantly continues, “com-
mit suicide ? ” What will happen, John, ’is that
some politician sure of his own seat will, on the
establishment of the Federal Parliament, or
before, move a reduction in the members of the
State Parliament, and members who vote against
that motion will be kicked out hy the people at
the next election. Politicians don’t commit sui-
cide, but cultivate horse-sense.
After all the provincialists’ clamour about
the baseness of the N.S.W. Public Service Board
ln “gagging the civil servants ” so that they can’t
speak out their sentiments against the horrid Bill,
it is interesting to read the Board’s announcement
that it hasn’t issued any ukase or circular, or
moved in the matter at all. The Civil Service Act
prohibits civil servants publicly interfering in
politics, and has always done so ; therefore it pro-
hibits them delivering speeches either for or
against Federation. It did the same thing last
year and the year before. So in the main the tale
is only the usual parochial whopper.
The voice of Pile’s dog in S.M. Hkkau>
on the downfall of Sydney through the Federal
capital being fixed somewhere else :
What will happen in Sydney is what actually did hap-
pen in Auckland when the seat of government was re-
moved to Wellington, only on a larger scale. Auckland
has scarcely yet recovered from that blow.
And poor Auckland got such an awful whack
from that blow that it grew from a very small
place to a city of 57,616 people—actually 16,000
more than the bloated capital of Wellington—and
is now far the biggest place in Maoriland, while
the stupendous metropolis comes fourth. And the
same thing is going to happen to Sydney. Let us
weep !
In many S.A. suburban constituencies not
only are there more females than males on the
Assembly electoral-rolls, but the woman vote is
actually the stronger. At Alberton, for
instance, outside Port Adelaide, there
are 590 females and 295 males enrolled ;
the vote t,be other day was 373 females
and 203 males. And in Lefevre Penin-
sula, adjoining, of 1567 females 865
voted, and of 1048 males 645 voted.
Unfortunately, these separate returns
are kept in only a very few districts; but
those that are kept quite knock out the
ancient theory that women don’t want to
vote and wouldn’t iftliey could.
According to the Age, 23
proposed new railways are to
be “ considered ”, by l T ic:
Govt. Barring the Mildura
lino and the railway to
dead-and-gone Deddick—
which the Age has the
cheek to include as if it
were quite a live un-
dertaking— they are
mostly lament able
little cockspurs in
already much - rail-
wayed districts, just
like the unprofitable
scraps that Gillies
used to construct.
Victoria wants main
lines—not cockspurs.
Particularly ic wants a
line to Mildura in the
west, and one to Orbost
in the east to open up the
fertile land which lies
idle in Croajingolong because even the roughest
kind of road is unobtainable.
Victorian Labor Day meeting was remark-
able for nothing save that most of the speakers—
Sangster, Hancock and others—preached—albeit
unwittingly straight-out Socialism. Sangster
drew a striking parallel between the present State
of Melbourne and that of Maoriland in ’BO, attri-
buting the latter’s present prosperity to the legis-
lation of Eallance and Sedclon. The Age report
of the meeting was full of covert sneers and
underhand innuendoes. The proposed nationalis-
ation of land, tramways, and other means of dis-
tribution is gall and wormwood to David Syme.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CO,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take,
what are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, nr
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS’S,"
where you are sure to get" a tit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

“HOW SHALL we DEFEAT the BED BIBD?”
IS THE QUESTION.
A Word of Caution to buyers should be offered. In buying: a Cycle, as in buying:
anything: requiring: supreme skill to produce the highest and most enduring results,
remember that the influence of the mass of makers and agents is enlisted against
the leading article of its kind, and that inducements other than-the intrinsic merits
of the goods themselves are fully used to force the sale of a cheaper line.
“ Under the best apple-tree are found the most sticks and stones.”
Many Cyclists receive considerations from other firms to talk against “ RED
BIRDS ” who are afraid of honest comparisons with honest goods.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Hip Australian Eleven has got fairly to work
now ; and the results of the first three matches are mixed
cloud and sunshine. The first match, against South of
England, was the most fairly contested; since the
weather favored neither side. From t hat our hoys oame
out with 87 runs to get to win and 9 wickets to fall—an
easy victory in prospect. Scores :S. of England, 246 :
Australia, 375 ; S. of England, 222-and the time-limit
drew the match.
Second match, against Essex and the Weather
saw an Australian downfall. The wicket was bad all
through, and in the fourth (Australian) innings it wag
rotten. Essex went in first and made 199; Australia.
144 ; Essex again, 144; and Australia, all to pieces, 73
beaten by 126 runs.
Third match, against Surrey, made amends and
put lid I Howell on the pinnacle of fame. Surrey, lucky
wit l> the toss went in on a drying wicket and scored 114 ;
the only William taking all the wickets. When this
paper went to press on Tuesday, four Australian wickets
la 'J „! f, n ”: r 122, ant * hopes were rosiest. Gregory’s 36
and Hill s 29 were then the best Australian scores on the
Doard.
* • • *
Tfckvvood, who went in ninth man for South of
England v. Australia, managed to make 42 runs without
losing his wicket—a useful start for his batting average
Graces management looks rather stupidly Conservative
in this case. Surely (he man who had hit 41 (not out) in
the first innings should have been given a chance to score
next time.
* * * *
Herald on the result of the South of
England match : “It may be pointed out as being re-
markable that the Englishmen totalled 246 and 222, and
the Australians 375 and one for 7, even and odd numbers
respectively, and that the figure 9, which does not occur
above, represents the number of wickets that the Aus-
tralians had in hand.” This is a sane paper’s criticism in
its leading column ! What has the figure 1 done not to be
mentioned when it represented the number of wickets
lost. Also 0 does not appear in any of the four totals,
although it does in Noble, the best score, and Jones, the
best bowler. ’

Ranjitsinhji has returned to England with his
old throat-complaint as bad as ever, but he talks as if
AusTralia* 1 900*1' u * )t a ' )ou *' s ' eaf hng an English team in
“Saw Ranjitsinhji at Cambridge this week,”
writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent. “He told
me that, though the Australian team was a very powerful
on . e j fc i>ey win lose the tests. “They haven’t Trott,” he
said, the working brain of Trott, that crushed us so
completely in Australia. There is only one man who
could attempt to fill the vacancy, and that is Trumhle,
whose selection is most unlikely.” And when you come
to think of it, and look round here, you can see there is
a very nice picnic being rigged up for, “ Our Boys.”
English cricket critics seem to fancy, although
it is early ffb talk, the following as a champion English
Al Grace, Abel, Jackson, Ranji., Tvidsley, Quaife,
Mason, Storer, Townsend, Fry, Lockwood, Hearne, and
Haigh. Strong in batting, but weak in bowling.
S.M. Herald in a leaderette (11/5/’99) re
AnstraJia y. South of England pointed out how the Aus-
tralian cricketers were handicapped by want of practice,
utterly ignoring the fact that, barring the six weeks’
voyage ’Ome, they had been playing through a six months’
season, whereas the Britishers were only in their second
week s cricket after a spell of eight months. Under the
circumstances, such an apology had better been left un-
written.

The Melb. football season opened on Saturday
by Fitzroy unexpectedly beating the much - vaunted
E3sendon by 47 points to 9—the same old club affected
b\ all that portion of Melb. which says “ haw” being 1 un-
able t 6 score a goal. A still greater boil-over was the
victory of Geelong over Collingwood—s4 to 27. St.
Kilda, which has not won a match for two years, main-
tained its average steadily, opening the season with a
defeat by Melb.—ll6 points to 23. S. Melb. easily beat
Carlton, Ports beat Richmond, and the new club of
Prahran lost its first match as a senior organisation
against Footscray.

Friday night’s rain gave Sydney footballers a
slippery time on Saturday. Marrickville beat University
by 19 points to 3 ; the ex-juniors, as they play themselves
into condition as the season advances, must prove a hard
nut for the best to crack. Marrickville scored 19 points
to nil in the first half, fairly outclassing University until
their condition seemed to fail them in the second half,
and University scored 3 to 0. Pirates ran over Buc-
caneers with 22 points to nil. Randwick v. Wallaroo was
the best-contested game of the day, Randwick winning
by 6 points to s—hard luck for Wallaroo, who, if any-
thing, played the better game. The match of least interest
was between Sydney and Parramatta, the former winning
by 10 points to nil.

The Celtic Park, Glasgow, is perhaps the finest
football-ground in the world, and next season it will
accommodate 100,000 spectators, all of whom will be able
to distinctly see the play. The club’s income last year
was €13,200, a record for Great Britain, if not the world.
On Ist Jan., ’9B, in an ordinary match with a sixpenny
admission, the takings at gates were £1470 13s. 6d.

S.T.C. Birthday Meeting begins at Randwick
to day (Saturday). The Hurdles looks well for Ladylike
and The Barber, whilst Chesterina or Glenroy should
account for Amateur Stakes, Eastern King, Stand Off,
Dozon and Cornquist appear to have good chances in
Royal S'akes, and of these perhaps the last-named will
prove winner—though taking a line by Auld Lang Syne’s
recent performances, that filly may have a say. Of the
five entered for Steeplechase, Whitefoot 11. should be
easily first; and Loch Long or Miss West may take the
T.C. Handicap. Sweep considerations will doubtless
conduce to a large field for Birthday Cup, in which
Eastern King, Crosslake, Kallatina and Vocalist seem
especially well treated. Crosslake may win, but people
should keep an eye on April Fool.

Strange that the most bitter opponent of Ikey
Mo in Sydney should unwittingly be his best friend.
Chipping Norton stable has provided more “turns-up”
or “skinners” for the “books” than any other half-
dozen put together—Aoa of Diamonds, last Saturday,
was the latest. Wonder if Mr. Bill Long does this
intentionally? Is he softening and endeavoring to put
the wherewithal towards a competency in the way of his
natural enemy before sending him to fresh fields per
medium of the long-threatened tote?

“ Mr. Barnes, of New York,” is the books’ cog-
nomen for a certain Yankee punter who lias lately been
having a bin run of luck “ backing ’em " at N.S.W. race-
meetings. A slout, red-faced little chap in a felt hat, he
first showed at the recent Wagga meeting, at which he
won t2OO ; then took a hurried trip to Sydney and helped
himself to £5OO at Rosehill, and got back to Narandera in
time to gather in £l5O or thereabouts at the local meet.
That Mr. B. knows something of the game, he proved at
Narandera, where he took all available money about a
certain good thing some time before the raoe, and then,
when said good thing looked rocky, laid the jock £5O to
nothing, and collected something like £3OO from the
Hebrews.
• • * •
One of the most remarkable little bits of horse-
flesh ever seen in N.S.W. is the country horse Dunbar, a
pony by Dunlop, who has lately been carrying all before
him at Riverine meetings. He is a common-looking little
chap, with a tueked-up appearance and shaky-looking
legs, and suffers from perpetual soreness. To see him
painfully stumbling out to the post you’d swear he
couldn't gallop a yard, and probably call his owner names
for letting him start; but all soreness disappears when he
starts to gallop, and he carries thumping weights home
in splendid time, and then limps back to the paddock.
Dunbar won the chief race at Gundagai recently after
breaking out of his box and spending the night in a
lucerne-paddook, and has carried big loads to the front
at Wagga, Narandera (a double) and Hay within the last
couple of weeks. He will probably soon be seen in Syd-
ney. Had he been brought to the city a few months ago
a small fortune could have been won on him.

Dear Bulletin.—A par. in a recent issue took
credit for “ an old-time Bulletin prediction that a pony
would yet win one of the big Australian handicaps,’’ but
the writer forgot to remark that Diffidence, the pony in
question, carried a very lightweight. The victory was
not much of an argument in favor of pony— i.e., under-
sized horse —racing as a sport. By the way, your par.
stated that Diffidence was the daughter of Etra-weenie
and the grand-daughter of “ Nellie, who gave Trenton to
the turf,” which would he a most immoral pedigree.
Etra-weenie was begotten by Trenton—Nellie. —Swjd

Wonderful what a change of stable does fora
horse sometimes. Forest, bought as a two-year-old by
Uphill, and leased by him to S. Miller, was a rank failure
in the red-and-white—couldn’t win a trial stakes. On
expiry of the lease, Uphill handed the horse to Lynch,
who has won seven races in as many months, including
the Newmarket, the Hill Handicap, and now the Good-
wood (under 9.3). Lynch, a plucky bettor, was pretty
hard-up till he got Forest. In Jan. last, when Forest
started his winning account at Maribyrnong, Lynch told
writer that he had emptied out on his horse—to the
extent of t'3. Now he has bought a pretty villa (grate-
fully labelled “ Forest Lodge”) and is reported to have
a few thousands “ socked.”

In the Elder Stakes at Morphettville (S.A.),
Contrast, in a field of only ten, paid a div. of £36. Her
owner, Mr. J. B. Pearson, had £2O on her. What chance
would he have had of getting £7OO to £2O off Ikey Mo ?
In Adelaide Cup, also won by Contrast, the tote paid
£3 16s. Od. or a shade over 5 to 2 ; while in Melbourne the
books were laying 2to 1. If you ask J. B. P.’s opinion,
he would say, “The tote, the only tote, and nothing but
the tote.”

Bill Lang, the old Vic. racing identity, dropped
dead in a blacksmith’s shop last week. Lang landed in
Melb. from Tasmania 62 years back, and one of the
traditions of his career as a jockey dates back to the 40’s.
He is said to have ridden Merino to victory in a 3-mile
race at Flemington when the saddle had turned round.
As a trainer and rider Lang is credited in the Calendar
with Oriflamme’s captures of the V.R.C. Derby and Leger
in ’63. Seven years later he trained Nimblefoot—the
horse that owner Craig, of Ballarat, dreamed about, ere
his death—for the Melb. Cup, and in ’7l Lang himself
steered Nimblefoot home in the Australian Cup. Of late
years the old man was chiefly noted for sensational dis-
appointments with Pigeontoe and Rosella. Pigeontoe
was, undoubtedly, the most deformed horse that ever
won a good race. After taking a Hotham Handicap he
started favorite for Melb. Cup.

Merloolas, the big-hearted,long-striding Queens-
lander, has at last been bought for export, and Sydney
loses the nearest approach to a really consistent cham-
pion it has seen for years. Amongst the weedy sprinters
and weak-hearted stayers of these days it is refreshing to
remember at least one horse who could go out with a big
weight up and finish after a gruelling 2 or 3 miles as
straight and game as a Carbine—beating better-trained
and faster-ridden animals by sheer pluck. Merloolas has
got nearer to the hearts of the N.S.W. sporting public
than any horse since “ Old Jack,” and many will be glad
to hear of the game old fellow often getting his well-
known “ bawly ” face in front in India.
* • • m
Multiform, the M.L. champion, now bound for
England, has started in 18 races, winning 16 and running
3 seconds—each time to a stable companion. Merloolas
also has a good record : 24 starts, 11 wins, 7 seoonds, 3
thirds.

At Ashburton (M.L.) Harold B. won a mile-
and-a-half trotting handicap from scratch in 3min. 47sec.
Harold 8., well-known this side, trots more like Fritz
than any other horse in Australia, and but for a bad
temper would have proved himself a champion.
* * • •
Trotting stands no chance of taking hold in
N.S.W. whilst the handicapping is so haphazard. At
Hawkesbur.v Show the two-miles trot was taken in a walk
by Seldom Fed, a pony which had won more than once
before. She was placed on 30sec. behind, whilst a mare
that had never previously started in a race was put on
BOsec. behind, and there were other instances just as
glaring. The mistake made by the country men is in not
engaging a man well up in the game to prepare their han-
dicaps. The recent Dubbo Trotting Club imposts were
furnished by Harry Knight with the result that on-
lookers got the novel experience of a cleverly-contested

Elying Fox, the Two Thousand Guineas win-
ner, is now an odds-on favorite for English Derby.
Captain’s Flat miner Dan O’Connell and Sydney
footballer Jack Ooilon had their much-heralded match
at Alhambra A. 0., Wednesday night, last week 1200
sports fl"ed the hall. Burs of money for O’Connell found
few takers, and then only at 6 to 4or 2 to 1 on. Four-
and-a-half-inmutes of actual fighting-time saw one man
(the miner) limp, helpless, and beaten, and the other (the
footballer) fresh and vigorous, as at the start. Hostilities
had barely commenced before they were over, for O'Con*
neH was settled in the first round, and came out
KvJl 18 . 00rner dazed. Such an unaccountable col-
lapse in so hot a pot has rarely been seen.
O Connell seemed paralysed from the call of time, and
foujfht wildly at the outset; “ stage-fright ” possibly had
a deal to do with his downfall, as it was his first public
%ht in Sydney, and he had never previously stood
before such a crowd The country pug. has found'backers
101 another go with his metropolitan adversary for half-a-
century aside. Three years back, O’Connell fought a pri-
vate match with Jack Dawson, at Seale’s Gymnasium
(Sydney), and such good judges of the game as George
Seale, Jim Barron, Tom Taylor, Jack Fuller, and many
others who witnessed that battle pronounced O’Connell a
tighter or the first order—hence the weight of money
behind him. That there was something wrong on
Wednesday week is shown by the readiness of the miner’s
supporters to risk £5O more. Writer saw O’Connell fight
the matoh with Dawson already referred to, and has no
doubt that he can do much better than his latest show-
ing.
Conlon, who licked Dan O’Connell in such short
order last vveek, promises to prove a lion in the path of
those aspiring to the middleweight championship of Aus-
tralasia. He possesses all the necessary attributes of a
fighter—height, reach, strength, youth, and that
essential, the fighting instinct, which must be inbred—it
can never be acquired. Conlon shows improvement every
time he fights. With O’Connell he refrained altogether
from sprinting round the ring, and went in and made the
best use of his extraordinary hitting powers. A match
between him and Mick Dunn is talked about ; if it hap-
pens Dunn will probably win, but he’ll have his work cut
out.

Five couples hanged away at each other right
lustily in first round of Alhambra (Sydney) A.O.’s 87
Novice Tournament on Saturday night. All' evinced the
greatest gusto for their work, while 500 or 600 people
looked on and enjoyed the fun. Total number of persons
patronising both boxing shows same evening must have
topped 1500. Where do they all come from?

. Featherweights Tom Hope and Tom Essler
(“ the Kaffir”) came together a third time at Golden Gate
A.C. (Sydney) last Saturday night, with the same result
—the black won, but not so quickly, as only 2min. of the
full journey (20 rounds) remained when Hope was made
oblivious per medium of two well-timed rights in the
region of the “ point.” The colored lad fought coolly
and fairly, while the white frequently lost control of him-
self and went close to fouling. Seemed that Essler in-
dulged in the cat-and-mouse business for a long time, as
he appeared capable of putting the “comether” on at
any stage after the ninth round, which was very fiercely
fought. A packed, orderly crowd witnessed the battle.
* * * *
‘‘Old Timer’’again: Referee at Golden Gate
A.C. (Sydney) still “ cautions ” fighters after the first foul
no matter how serious it may be—which, of course,
means that every combatant at that particular place has
a license to foul his adversary once—even to the extent of
doubling him up and actually disabling him. Witnessed
another glaring infringement of M.Q. rules at same place
on Saturday night. Twice at critical periods, while fight-
ing was hot, Tom Hope’s glove-strings became undone.
He was allowed to retire to his corner and sit down while
the strings were re-tied by seconds who got into the ring,
fanned, wiped and rubbed their principal down—all this
during the course of the round 1

“C. v : Saw the latest featherweight-champion
boxer of N.S.W.—Essler (“The Kaffir”) —at work on
Saturday night. Shades of Griffo and Billy Murphy (who,
though not dead in the fl ab, are to the world). What a
man to be a champion 1 Decent enough, game enough,
and strong enough he is, no doubt, but clever enough—
oh 1 Why, any greenhorn well up in the rudiments
(“ stop ” and “ counter ”) of the game, would soon settle
“The Kaffir,” who leaves himself open from the head
down every time he leads with the left. What a pepper-
ing Griffo would have given him—and what a peppering
he will assuredly get from the first skilful man he meets.

Dear Bulletin.—ln the matter of gray horses :
They may not be a success as racers, but the grays are
the solid workers, the hardy long-journey hacks, the
game, plodding stayers when the brumby mob’s afoot;
and out on the Western rivers, when the wool comes
rocking in by the ten-ton loads, it’s all Bourke to a bridle
that the best horse in the team is the worn old gray with
the scalded shoulders and the ragged hips. Any horse-
man will tell you of the confidence with which he gets
across a flea-bitten gray—the redder the flecks on him
the better he is. Grays for me, good luck to ’em ! —Will
H. Ooilvie.

Nine of the “ talent ” were roped-in at Auck-
land (M.L.) lately for playing an illegal game—“ two-up,”
the orthodox “kip” (piece of wood) and two coppers
being used. “Kip” was produced in evidence, but the
beak discharged the surprised crowd on the ground that
a piece of wood wasn’t a gambling instrument?

“Saved ” : “ Has one aspect of the Sydney Safe
Deposit occurred to you? Most people insure against
loss by fire and receive money compensation for property
destroyed. But there are some things—valuable papers,
heirlooms, etc.—which can never be replaced, and the
loss of which means a fortune. The Safe Deposit, for a
comparatively small sum, not only insures against the
loss of these things, it saves the articles themselves.
What is a guinea or two a year compared with a docu-
ment upon which thousands depend?” Safe Deposit is
in Ash-street, back of Palings, off George-street.*

The other morning Brisbane Courier
actually counselled the Leperland sugar-growers
to support the Commonwealth Bill on the ground
that their interests in the devastating kanaka and
the crawlsome Chow cook would be safer in the
hands of a Federal Parliament than with the
local Legislature. This looks like somebody’s
little device for scaring the democratic vote away
from k ederation. Queensland’s best chance to get
nd of its leper lies in the fact that the Democratic
Federal Parliament will have control of alien legis-
lation.
Hackett, of the West Australian, after
starting as an ardent federationist, has somer-
saulted, and now leads the forlorn hope of the old
Sandgroper-party. His partner, Charles Harper,
is a large landowner and fruit-grower. Hackett’s
latest:—
It is quite impossible to conceal the fact that a large
number of people believe with dread that in the event
of the Bill going at once to the people a big vote would
be cast in the interests, not of Western Australia, or even
of Australia itself, but of one or more of the sister
colonies.
Apples are selling at Is. per lb. in Perth shops,
but still the Sandgropers want more protection
against the Eastern growers, d n them !
Barton, and Deakin last week received a
splendid reception from the people of Brisbane.
The biggest hall in the province was densely
packed long before the business began, and clusters
of enthusiasts, unable to obtain admission, hung
on to the masonry round the lofty windows, and
the ventilators in the roof were plugged with ears.
Nothing like it has been seen in Brisbane for
years, and the speeches of the principal speakers
were fully up to the occasion and roused the
greatest enthusiasm. A show of hands proclaimed
unanimous approval of the Commonwealth Bill,
and the meetingdispersed with hurricane cheers for
‘ Barton,” “ Deakin,” and “Australia.” Federal
feeling, so long latent in Q., is bursting out with
great intensity.
Another Australian claimant to a big
British property is W. R. Bickell, of Lindfield,
Sydney, who reaches out for about half of the vast
Westminster possessions. He traces his descent
from a family which became connected by mar-
riage with the Grosvenors, and which had an
estate which it is alleged became merged in the
Westminster possessions in such a way as to make
Bicknell virtually co-heir with the present
Viscount Belgrave. If there’s anything in this—
what a carcase for the legal vultures ! But the
claimant who, like Bicknell, has to establish a
title from 119 years back, has a hard row to hoe,
and official registers were not then what they are
to-day.

THE BEAUTY OF THE
MASSEY-HARRIS
BICYCLE
Has always been famous. This year
we have surpassed all previous
efforts and produced a bicycle as
near perfection as our skill
and the practically unlimited re-
sources of our great factories can
make it. The design is elegant
and graceful, and every detail
of workmanship and finish has been
brought to tempting ideality.
ONE GRADE ONLY
THAT THE HIGHEST.
We confine our efforts and the efforts
of every one of the 600 skilled
mechanics in our factories to the
perfecting; of One model, one
only; and no maker who scatters his
energies over half a dozen models
can hope to compete with us. For
years we have tested, improved and
perfected, this one model of
Massey-Harris Bicycle
until, we believe, it is superior in
every way to any other bicycle that
has yet been built.

The Bulletin last night dreamt that it
looked in at an anti-Federal dinner. Dibbs was
presiding, with Rosa on his right and Holman as
vice-president. In places of honor were, among
others, Pilcher, Kohen, M'Laurin, Haynes, Knox,
and Brolly Hughes. . Dibbs, raising his glass
and winking at Piloher, exclaimed —“ Here’s to
Anarchy, Socialism and Levelling Down ! ” The
sentiment was received. with great enthusiasm,
whereupon Rosa, winking at his crowd, proposed
“ Here’s to Sydney, the Federal City, and Higher
Rents ; also to Disunion and Cheap Sugar from
Fiji! ” This latter toast moved Knox to tears,
And Pilcher became so violently hysterical that
The Bulletin woke up.
Three years ago (thp event is reported in
the Sydney dailies, 29/l/ ? 96) the N.S.W. Political
Labor League resolved, among other things, that
in elections for the Federal Senate “ each colony
should vote as one constituency.” Hughes and
Watson, M’s.L.A., were among the supporters of
the idea, and it was carried with enthusiasm —
Watson, M.L.A., declaring that the resolution
“marked a clear line” between the genuine
Labor-party and the sham Democrats then in
office. Now, the principle that the Labor League
demanded on democratic grounds is in the Federal
Constitution, and the loudest guns of the party
(Holman and Brolly Hughes) go round denouncing
it as a soul-blasting engine of oppression and a
scheme by which only the richest variety of Fat
Man will get into the Federal Senate. Yah !
A year or so ago Premier Reid, being then
in the anti-Federal camp, appointed a finance
committee of two bitter Provincialists (Messrs.
MacLaurin and French—both now appear on the
anti-Federal platform) and one Federalist (Bruce
Smith) to inquire into things, so as to be sure of
getting a majority report against the Bill. The
two bitter Provincialists started the famous
twenty-two-and-sixpenny bosh, Bruce Smith dis-
senting in a very loud postscript. The point at
issue now is this: When Dr. MacLaurin and the
Telegraph and the Sunday rag quote the 225. 6d.
lie as the finding of the committee, they only tell
part of the truth—it was a finding of part of the
committee only. And when Dr. MacLaurin
refers to the committee (his own committee) as an
authority, he simply olaims that the 225. 6d. bosh
which MacLaurin tells now must be correct
because MacLaurin (as a committee) told it before.
John Norton, objecting to hired toughs
being ejected from a publio meeting which they
were disturbing
No Constitution, Federal or otherwise, that cannot
command sufficient public confidence and support to
carry it through without the aid of policemen, is worthy
of a moment's consideration at the hands of a presumably
free people.
Also : No well-stocked jeweller’s shop which can-
not command sufficient confidence and support to
carry it through without police protection is
worthy of a moment’s consideration, etc. Like-
wise, no presumably free people which cannot do
without policemen is worthy, etc. Further, any
free people which won’t allow itself to be bossed
and gagged by toughs is worthy, etc. The
question is, after all, very simple : Does freedom !
at public meetings mean the freedom of 1000 men
to hear the speakers, or the freedom of, say, 10
ruffians to say that the other 990 shan’t hear ? In
other words, does it mean freedom to curse and
yell and kick, or freedom from the coercion of the
yellers and kickers ?
The two heads of the Sydney Daily Tele-
graph monstrosity try to speak at the same time: '
ON APRIL 24, 1899. ON JUNE 22, 1898. j
“ Under the Braddon Blot “The removal of the
it” (the Amended Bill) Braddon Blot will not
“ puts £1,700,000 a year lessen the 225. 6d. per head
new taxation on the people additional taxation by a
of this colony.” single penny.”
Therefore : (1) It is the existence of the Braddon
clause which puts the alleged extra taxation on.
(2) If the Braddon clause didn’t exist the extra
taxation would be there all the same, therefore it
isn’t the Braddon clause which puts it on after all.
The two-headed paper will now go out to get both
its hair cut.
It is claimed by the anti-Federal Party
that there will be “ almost a block-vote of N.S.W. 1
Civil Service against the Bill.” If the Service
has the faintest idea when to get in out of the
damp there will be nothing of the kind. Federa-
tion means that the postal and telegraph officials,
those of the statistician’s office, Observatory and
Mint, a good part of the Treasury crowd, and, pro-
bably, a little later on, the great Education
Department, will be removed from the control of
the Public Service Board. And the Service
somehow doesn’t like its Board. Most of it would
gladly tie 24 volumes of Encyclopedia Britan-
Nica round the Board’s neok and drop it over
South Head.
Extract from a girl’s letter from London :
How do you like the idea of Lord Beauchamp as
Governor for Sydney? Everyone here was so surprised
at his appointment, as he is so young. There are
whispers of an affair with one of his mother’s maids,
whom he is said to be educating on the Continent as the
future Lady B. But that is rather hard to believe, as he
has the reputation of having—to put it mildly— very
select ideas. One of his fads is an autograph-book which
appears to be kept exclusively for the names of duchesses
and ambassadors’wives. A little while ago he was stay-
ing in Ireland with Lord , and some girls who were
in the house found the precious book and, uninvited,
wrote their names there, with all kinds of nonsense-
verses, such as “Hi diddle diddle,” and “Dr. Foster
went to Gloster.” I believe His Lordship’s indignation
was terrible to behold.

The vituperation poured on the N.S.W. !
Freetrade Ministry by Sydney Daily Telegraph
is nearly paralleled by the paper’s adulation of
Dr. M'Laurin. The Telegraph, which aspires to
king-making, has for its present idols M'Laurin,
Heydon, Dibbs, Lyne, and Pilcher, the back-
bone of the Conservative section of the Protec- j
tionist party whom, at last general election, it
professed so utterly to abhor. If the Bill is de-
feated* N.S. Wales will be faced with another
wearying fiscal fight, and the Telegraph will
then have to battle for the discredited Reid
against its Mte noir —a powerful Protectionist
party.
On© famous phas© of the Dean case finds
points of resemblance in the 0 Callaghan (Melb.)
inquest—an inquiry which has already been ad-
journed several times for the purpose of discovering
who is the father of the deceased infant. An
agreement was drawn up during the child’s life
whereby it was to be adopted for a sum of £.)O,
one Rigby, a solicitor, acting in the matter for
the father. The latter’s name was demanded by
the coroner when Mr. Rigby entered the box, but
the lawyer pleaded privilege, and the inquest has
been many times adjourned to decide whether
Rigby is or is not bound to divulge the name of
his client. The whole of legal Melb. has been
hunting up the question, and, strange to say, not
one absolute ruling on the subject has been dis-
covered. The nearest applies to an instance
where a solicitor was held to be entitled to with-
hold his client’s address, but then only condition-
ally on there being no crime in the case and pro-
vided the address was given to him as part of
a professional confidence. The average man, who
fondly believes that his lawyer is entitled to keep
everything he knows up his sleeve, will be sur-
prised to know that the authorities rule that a
solicitor, knowing his client’s name or address
from a friend, or from living next door to him, or
from a casual remark, may be compelled to divulge
the same, and that a name oraddres3 is privileged
only when revealed to the lawyer in a definitely
professional way. As to whether Rigby is privi-
leged in the present case, the ruling will probably
be in his favor, the opposition made by the Crown I
Law Department being but half-hearted.


Cure
for Colds
When the children get their feet wet and
take cold give them a hot foot-bath, a bowl
of hot drink, a dose of Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral, and put them to bed. The chances are
they will be all right in the morning. Continue
the Cherry Pectoral a few days, until all
cough has disappeared.
Old coughs are also cured; we mean the
coughs of bronchitis, weak throats and irrita-
ble lungs. Even the hard coughs of consump-
tion are always made easy and sometimes
cured by the continued use of
Ayer’s
Cherry
Pectoral
Your own doctor will explain this to you.
He knows that wild cherry bark is the best

THE ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS of
Sept. 28, 1895, says:
“ If I were asked which single medicine I should
prefer to take abroad with me, as likely to be
most generally useful, to the exclusion of all
others, I should say Chlorodyne. I never travel
without it, and its general applicability to the
relief of a large number of simple ailments forms
its best recommendation.”
Demoorat Jones, a miner in a S.Q, town,
found himself boycotted by local mine-owners on
aooount of his political proclivities. Traced origin
of aforesaid boycotting to Goldbug-Gubbins, to
whom Jones, in public, administered a dose of
horsewhip, for which offence the pugnacious
Jones spent a few months in gaol. On coining
out, Jones found that his friends had kindly pro-
vided him with a few pounds by handsomely
mounting aforesaid horsewhip in silver and raffling
it among themselves—ss. a ticket. Saddler Sur-
cingle, a friend of Gubbins, and also no enemy of
Jones, had bought a ticket in above-mentioned
raffle, out of a pleasant desire to stand well with
all men. Wfien raffle eventuated, Surcingle
found, to his horror, that he himself had won the
silver-mounted horsewhip, that the occurrence was
in the local papers, and that he had lost the
custom and friendship of Gubbins — a man re-
nowned for his love of horseflesh and all that ap-
pertains thereto.

“ Ignotus ” on that much-worried question
—“ When does the century end? ”:
I notice different opinions about this, even in journals
of high standing ; but have nowhere seen a clear explana-
tion of how it is there can be more than one. Briefly, a
man’s first birthday is when he is one year old, and, con-
sequently, his hundredth when he is 100 years old. The
first century, on the other hand, begins at the beginning
of the year 1. There is no year 0. This important point
can be gathered, I presume, from any history cover-
ing the period. Dr. Schmitz, for instance, in his
“ History of Rome,” says Tiberius stayed at Rhodes
from b.c. 6 to a.d. 2, a period of nearly seven years.
This implies that the year before a.d. 1 was B.c. 1.
Hence the first century is a year old at the end of the
year 1, and is a hundred years old, or ends, at the end of
a.d. 100. Another explanation was that a child who is called
“ one year old ”is in his second year; a man “of 25” is in
his 26th year ; a man of 99 is in his 100th year, and completes
it on his hundredth birthday, at the hour of his birth.
Yet another was: If a man says “it is my hundredth
birthday,” he means he has completed 100 years,
he has actually lived through 100 in succession. But, if
we say Trajan refused to pay the Dacian tribute on the
Ist Jan , a.d. 100, w r e mean he was then commencing the
last year of the Ist century ; and when, at the end of a.d.
100, he marched against them, then the century ended.
A London writer says the Arabian chronology begins
with the year. Ours, as I have shown, does not. A
clerical friend, assuming Christ’s birth to he Dec. 25, told
me he supposed that year would be called “ the year of
the Birth of our Lord ” ; the year before it b.c. 1, the year
after a.d. 1. This introduces another difficulty, a year
which belonged to neither the first century a.d. nor the
first century b.c. But my clerical friend was in error.
Our chronology starts from a certain Ist of January, the
year before Tiberius returned from Rhodes to Rome, and
the clerical chronologists (see authorised version of Bible,
top-note), do not scruple to say Christ was born “b.c. i
or 5.”
[The French Revolutionary Tribunal adopted the
Christian method. Year one of the Republic
begins with the establishment of the Republic,
There was no year 0. The argument of Ignotus,
if one wished to be hypercritically exact, is in-
correct, however; the man who is 21 has had 22
birthdays, and the man who is one hundred has
had 101 birthdays. Each has had, respectively,
only 21 and 100 “ anniversaries ” of his birthday.

HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
■with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and beep told your case is hopeless, or

CURh, YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because

Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir. —I feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two vears ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALKALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, C. J. A. NIELSEN.

Dear Sir, —Having suffered for some time from a com-

advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Aifaline Remedies, and their effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to my

myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,

easy and pleasant to take, and does not necessitate ab-
sence from business. For people engaged in sedentary
employment nothing could be better. Wishing you
every success,—l remain, Yours truly,

“ Ah, talk of blessings ! What a blessing is diges-
tion ! To digest. L>o you know what it means ?
It is to have the sun always shining and the shade
always ready for you. It is to be met by smiles
and greeted with kisses. It is to hear sweet sounds,
to sleep with pleasant dreams, to be touched ever
by gentle, soft, cool hands. It is to be in Paradise.
“There came a great indigestion upon the earth
and it was called a deluge. All the evil comes
from this. Macbeth could not' sleep ;it was the
supper, not the murder. His wife talked and
talked ;it was the supper again. Milton had a
bad digestion, and Carlyle must have had the
worst digestion in the world. Ah !to digest is to
be happy ! ”
There ! —how does that strike you for a burst of
eloquence ? I quote from Trollope. If there is any-
thing wrong about the theology you must hold him
responsible. As for its physiology and pathology
(pardon, all these “ologies ”) I can answer for the
correctness of these two. And so can millions of
people besides me. They speak of the curse of in-
digestion continually in every language ; they
groan and writhe under it in every land and
climate.
“For many years,” says one of this innumerable
army of martyrs, “I was obliged to bear as best I
could the torments of indigestion. My appetite
was practically destroyed, I ate, of course, because
one must eat or die ! but after meals I had great
pain at the chest and around the sides.
Sleep almost forsook my pillow, and naturally I
was tired and exhausted. Sometimes better and
then worse, but never free from pain and illness, I
lived on with little or no hope of getting well. It
is hardly necessary to say that I had medical
treatment, yet no real benefit resulted from it.
Happily at this time Mother Seigel’s Syrup was
brought to my notice, and so strongly commended
that I laid aside other medicines, which were doing
me no good, and began using this one only.
“ In a short time I realised a great improvement ;
food agreed with me and I gained strength. A
little later—continuing to take the Syrup regularly
as directed —the pains at the stomach, sides and
chest wholly ceased, and I have not felt them
since. My indigestion was cured at last, and I en-
joyed the blessing of health. My son, who suffered
severely from rheumatism has been relieved by
Mother Seigel’s Syrup as by nothing else he ever
tried. In gratitude I give you full permission to
publish my letter should you desire.” (Signed)
(Mrs.) Ann Barker, Field Lane, Braughing, Ware,
Herts. Oct. 7, 1898.
It was a fortunate circumstance for Mrs. Sarah
Gell, of Melchbourne, Bedfordshire, that one day
she had a personal talk with Mr. Smith, the
butcher at Rushden. He told the lady that in his
opinion if she went on suffering from indigestion
and asthma (one of its consequences) it would be
because she neglected to use Mother Seigel’s
Syrup. “ And, ” said Mr. Smith, “I speak from
knowledge.” She had been ill with this abomin-
able ailment for many years, and had spent time
and money in unavailing efforts to obtain relief.
Acting on Mr. Smith’s advice, Mrs. Gell began
using this remedy at once, and tells the outcome
in a letter of which we have room for the con-
clusion only :
“I was better almost immediately, and was
soon as well and healthy as one could wish to be.
Now I keep ‘ Mother Siegel ’ in the house, and it
never fails to help us when needed for any passing
complaint.” (Signed) Sakah Gell, Oct. sth, 1898.
Judging from the force of his comment on the
disease, I should say Mr, Trollope knew some-
thing about indigestion from experience. Most
literary people do. To them, and to all other
victims I confidently commend the best remedy
yet found —Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
No Household should be without it. To Farmers it is
invaluable. It should be found in every Stable.
All Athletes should use it. It Cures Speedily and
Permanently.

COUGHS, COLDS on the CHEST,
BRONCHITIS & ASTHMA
Rapidly Cured by
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its
wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of bron-
chitis, distressing cough, difficulty in breathing, hoarse-
ness, pain or soreness in the chest, experience delightful
and immediate relief, and to those who are subject to
colds on the chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete
cure. It is most comforting in allaying tickling and irri-
tation in the throat, and giving strength to the voice, and
it never allows a cough or asthma to become chronic. No
house should be without it, as, taken at. the beginning, a
dose is generally sufficient, and a complete cure is certain.
“ Mr. W. G. lIEARNE.—Dear Sir,—l had a bad attack
of Bronchitis for six months, with dreadful hacking cough
day and night and great quantity of phlegm. Night
sweats came on and pains in my chest, and I got so weak
that I could not leave my bed. At this stage I was pro
nounced to be in consumption. I had a lot of medicines
of different kinds, but nothing did me any good until,
reading in the Age of your ‘ Bronchitis Cure,’ I got a
bottle, and after taking two doses I was much improved.
After taking two bottles the cough and night sweats left
me, my appetite returned, and I was able to get up ; and
am now in good health, for which I am truly grateful, and
shall recommend your Medicine to all my friends.—Yours
truly, E. SMITH, Halpin Park, Nhill, Victoria.”
“ After suffering from asthma until I was 17 years old,
and having been under a great many different treatments’
without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s Medicine
for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this medicine,
I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then, which was
in the beginning of 1883,14 years ago, I have not had the
slightest return of it. The Medicine quite cure me, and
I have much pleasure in recommending it.—ALEX. J.
ANDERSON, Geelong, Victoria.”

Death Dreaded
AND EXPECTED,
CLEMENTS TON IQ
PERFORMS ANOTHER
Great Cure.
The Case of
MRS. MARGARET BLOMFIELD.
(From the “ Marrickville Express.”)
Mr. Frederick Blomfield is the Asphalter
to the Marrickville Council, and is widely
known and much respected. He lives in
the Illawarra Road near tram line. Mrs.
Blomfield lately recovered in a most extra-
ordinary manner from what looked like her
last illness. The doctors, after efforts as
strenuous as unavailing, were at length com-
pelled to acknowledge themselves beaten,
and gave up her case as hopefess. As a
consequence of the continual reports of the
strange “ bringing back to life ” of this
lady, our reporter was sent to interview her
and her husband. The newspaper writer
was ushered into a pretty little drawing-
room by Mr. Blomfield, who, on hearing
what was required, at once called his wife,
and remained during the whole interview,
from time to time interjecting with some
detail confirmatory of his wife’s story.
Our reporter at once noticed that Mrs.
Blomfield looked in excellent health and
spirits, and said, “ Your health looks all
right now.”
“It is splendid, indeed,” replied Mrs.
Blomfield, “ and I have never been better
in my life than I have been since my cure
some months ago, nor have I ever found it
necessary to take a dose of medicine since.”
“ Now, Mrs. Blomfield,” said the press
man, “ I would like precise and unexag-
gerated details of your illness.”
“ With pleasure,” was the response. “It
was a peculiar weakness, and seemed like
disease of the heart, and came on in
such a slow, deceitful sort of way that it was
a long time before I realised that there
was really anything wrong with me. The
five doctors thab I employed one after
another were baffled, and were entirely
unable to form a satisfactory diagnosis of
my case, though they all agreed my heart
was affected. I was ill altogether for
about twelve months. I first felt a dis-
inclination to move about. This was soon
succeeded by a sickening feeling of sinking
and weakness at the heart. I was affected
with a sort of giddiness. The room would
sometimes seem to turn with me. I had a
suspiciously big appetite. That is, I ate
a great deal more than was usual with me:
but, strange to say, I got thinner and
thinner daily. My food was of no service,
and, notwithstanding all I ate, I began
to slowly fall away like a child with a
wasting disease. I gradually became
reduced to a skeleton, and my bones
stuck out plainly through my skin. I had
long enough been forced to give up my
household d uties, and I was now obliged to
lie up. I became bedridden altogether. My
hands trembled, so with nervousness that
when I took hold of anything it would fall
from my nerveless hands. I was horribly
depressed in spirits. I could stand no sort
of a noise or shock without suffering most
acutely afterwards.”
14 And your rest ? ”
“ Ah ! that was the most painful part of
my illness. Night followed night and I never
closed my eyes, nor could I find any rest in
the daytime. I nearly went mad from want
of sleep.”
“ You couldn’t last long like this.”
“ Well, you shall hear. In addition to
my already distressing syrqptoms I was
attacked with rheumatic fever. My legs
and feet swelled terribly. Every part of my
body was 'filled with agonising aches and
pains. Intense headaches added to my
misery. I was powerless to move, and had
tobe lifted aboutandtufnedfromsidetosidein
bed. I suffered from a shocking shortness
of breath, and often I had to be raised into
an upright position to breathe, or I should
have been suffocated. And, as for my
appearance, people have told me since that
I looked as though I was knocking at
Death’s door, There seemed to be nothing
left for me but to die, and, indeed, death
sometimes seemed as though it would have
been a welcome relief. Many times at night
the neighbours would say, as I have since
heard, ‘ Ah, that poor Mrs. Blomfield—we
shall see the blinds down in the
morning. She will pass away to-night.*
Day after day as I lingered on their prophecy
proved an untrue one. But they were very
nearly right. The doctors had indeed given
me up, their medicines were unable to help
me, and, worse than all, I-had given up hope
myself. The vital spark of life was already
flickering -at any moment it might have
gone out for all time. It was just at this
crisis, and wfien all seemed lost, that an un-
expected circumstance turned the balance in
my favour. A friend of my husband’s
hurried down to see him. ‘Get a bottle of
Clements Tonic at once,’he said, ‘I have
heard that that remedy has performedalarge
number of unexpected cures around this
district; it might prove the saving of your
wife’s life.’ My husband complied with the
suggestion, and before I had taken one
bottle he had the satisfaction of finding that
a marvellous difference for the better had
boci. made in my condition by that medicine.
The pains which li id. so racked my weakened
frame ceased to trouble me, and a
feeling of serenity came over my exhausted
nervous system ; then I began to get sleep
again. The swelling in my limbs went
down, and very shortly was gone entirely.
Clements Tonic acted like magic on my
spirits. After months of melancholy I now
enjoyed a cheerfulness of spirit and firmness
of nerve, which aided my general recovery
of health to an enormous extent. In four or
five weeks so great a difference had Clements
Tonic made i n my appearance that I was hardly
to be recognised as the same woman who a
few weeks previously had been helplessly
stretched on a sick bed. My food
strengthened me, and digested with ease.
I put on flesh at a most astonishing rate.
My husband was delighted with the success
of Clements Tonic, which had so
opportunely been brought under his notice.
He took good care that I took regular doses,
and very shortly I was able to get out of
bed, and was completely restored to health,
and, as I told you, I have never felt better,
and have had no need to take Clements
Tonic since. My cure was absolute and
complete. There is no doubt as to the
wonderful vitalizing power of Clements
Tonic, nor as to the permanency of its effects.
To put it plainly and shortly, ‘ My life was
saved by Clements Tonic.’ Needless to say,
I feel grateful, and that is why I am
willing, or, more correctly speaking, anxious
to make the good qualities of this potent
remedy more widely known, and may others
receive benefit from Clements Tonic as I
did.”
“ This will appear in the newspapers.”
“ Wherever and whenever you like,”
replied Mrs. Blomfield.”

“They!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Credulous ! ”
It was the only charge which could have spurred
the philosopher into anything like abruptness.
The turpentine splashed from his bottle as he
slapped it down upon his table and wheeled round
to glare through his glasses like a benevolent
dragon.
“ Let me put you in your proper place upon
this matter, young man—once for all,” he began,
warmly, but then, with the methodicalness which
was the essence of him, he sat down to check off
his points upon his fingers.
“ There are three attitudes towards this ques-
tion. First —that of fatuous credulity ; second —
that of not much less fatuous incredulity ”
“ Like mine ? ” Fetherstone put in.
“Like yours,” answered the uncompromising
Beckley—“ exactly.”
“ Thanks. And the third ? ”
“ The third is the only possible present attitude
of the scientific intellect —suspended judgment,
sir ; suspended judgment.”
The old man turned to his bird-stuffing again,
and Fetherstone chewed his beard for a minute
before he said,
“But science —if it means anything —means
certainty! ”
“Science never meant certainty, and never
said so !. Science means simply the best present
explanation of phenomena. The only ‘ science ’
that ever claimed certainty is the one thing that
never proved anything—theology ! ”
Fetherstone—putting on at the same time his
cartridge-belt and a less aggressive tone —said the
jibe didn’t touch him. He was no theologian.
“ I simply don’t believe in spooks because spooks
are impossible !—and there’s an end of it! ”
Says Beckley, “ Only the beginning, perhaps !
It’s generally you cock-sure people who rush from
the one extreme to the other. I shouldn’t wonder
to find you come back a true believer! ”
Says Fetherstone—
“ Shoo! ”
* * * *
“ The kapal-antul"— and the Dyak “ head-man”
clutched his hair at mention of the spirit-ship.
“No !—he wouldn’t send any of his young men
thither. In fact, they wouldn’t go, if he did !
Did not the white man know of the Burns, many
and of much wickedness, who dwelt in that ac-
cursed ship ? ”
“Yes ; the white man knew of all that woman-
talk. And the Dyaks—who called themselves
men—were but women, after all! He would go
alone! ”
Thus, Fetherstone—jobbing his rifle-butt into
the sand, as he smiled at his own assumption that
a common weakness had brought together such
extremes as Beckley the sage and Batambu the
savage. For seldom of the Sons of Logic is the
man whose argumentative clincher is an “im-
possible!” The sage had but wasted his exposi-
tion—as the savage wasted, now, his proverbial
philosophy.
Qnir? f-ho little Dvak, with a large dignity
“White man, thou art brav e because t iou ar

walked away along the sunset-reddened beach.
“That’s the ‘Quern Dms ’ busi ness over
But I'm not likely to ‘per dev e this turn unless
H Th?' B h ur^ iU rheSed the rocky
point-was gone by the time he had clamberedup,
and—standing by the solitary palm ] ’
to where the ancient ship sat black and sol 2
above a high-water mark that had receded fr
her with the lapse of time. There wasagnm
challenge in her sinister lonehness— as in his know
ledge that not for years had any man set foot at night
within a mile of that ill-reputed relic of an ill-
reputed past. He looked back towards the Uyak
village with much the feeling of a man who shuts
a door behind him on the light. Then, with a
sudden movement, he went on. (l
“ Shoo !” he said, for the third time. Hon t
you be an old woman, too, Phil Fetherstone .
* * * *
There was a wild wind whistling when Beckley
woke —with the suddenness and completeness born
of his adventurous life. He had that instinct,
too —primary or secondary, who shall say . which
warns some men of an unwelcome presence in the
darkness.
“That you, Fetherstone?” he called, but only
wind-shrieks answered, and the old man, feeling
first for his revolver, struck a match. He was
alone, to his eye—but, to that weird sixth sense
of his, emphatically not so ! Yet steadily he lit
his lamp, before —with the long Colt ready m his
shakeless hand —he peered into the only corner
that could hide a man. And as he looked a voice
said suddenly and close behind him —
“ To the wreck ! ”
Beckley wheeled, gaped an instant, then laughed
softly at himself. “An acoustic freak !” he said.
“There’s somebody outside.”
But there wasn’t! A third-quarter moon-
driving, green and angry, through wild wisps of
scud—showed him the platform vacant; neither,
looking over and around, could he see aught upon
the pallid waste of sand, save the cocoa-palms
writhing to the wind like tortured ghosts.
He went inside and sat down. “Fetherstone
was in my mind,” he thought; “ yet the voice
didn’t strike me as his —which is a point in favor
of its objectivity. And the words? No, they
were not imagined. I’ll go ! ”
He took brandy, a bull’s-eye lantern, matches
and cartridges, belted on his pistol, and went.
* * * *
The wind, shrieking in the old man’s ears with
many-pitched mockery of voices, flicked fiercely
in his face a sand that pricked like needles, but
as he neared the gloomy ruin of a ship he felt that
he was otherwise impeded. Faint pushes from
his front!—faint clutches from behind ! —these
things; he told himself, were neither wind nor
sand—noryetimagination; for, ashe slackened pace
to look around him, the shoves became almost
blows —the clutches strong enough to move a
standing man.
But Science serves her votaries well. In
Beckley’s mind there was no room for anything
but delight at the transcendent novelty of this
experience. “ This beats the vox et preterea
nihilJ” he said; and, coolly, in that appalling
severance from human companionship, he made
experiment—pushed energetically on, and found
the forces weaken; relaxed his pace, and found
them strengthen in the inverse ratio. “Then the
human will is still a factor ! ” he said, exultantly,
as reaohing the sombre shadow of the wreck, he
felt his movements altogether unopposed.
The wide, old-fashioned main-channel was with-
in his reach. He clambered up, and, through a
gap in the rotten bulwarks, reached a deck that
had better stood the test of time. The main-
hatch, with its coamings gone, yawned cavernous
before a sturdy stump of mast; the bollards of
some strange old anchor-getting gear still held
their place forward ; save these, nothing broke the
sweep of deck between a fore-“ castle ’’ that de-
served its name and an even loftier poop.
“ Portuguese, I fancy ! ” Beckley muttered, as
he lit his lantern. “ I’ll take the forecastle first! ”
But, as ho went, a noise behind him made him
turn. “ Oh, here you are,” he said. “ I was
beginning to think ”
His words froze up. Was this the man he
sought, coming slowly from under the break of the
poop, or was it Fetherstone’s corpse galvanised
somehow into horrible post-mortem motion? The
moonlight fell upon the face—black, as from
strangulation—twisted, as by the touch of paraly-
sis. The jaw hung down —the unretained saliva
glistened on the beard. But the eyes, distended
in a petrifying glare, had sight in them. The
man, or thing, stopped opposite Beckley and
laughed—a laugh more coldly frightful than all
else, the laugh of an unseated intellect.
“What is this, in the name of Heaven?”
Beckley laid his hand upon the rigid arm
“ What have you seen ? Where’s your rifle ? ”
The other looked back towards the poop and
shuddered till his cap fell off. “ They may come
out,” he whispered. “Oh, God ! —they may
come after me ! ” With a sudden spring, he was
over the side and off along the sand.
A moment stood the philosopher, distracted
between fear for his friend and unshaken eager-
ness to search this matter to the bottom.
“ No,” he said, ruefully, “ I must follow, were
it only as the doctor.”
For six days Fetherstone lay, differentiated
only from a log by the fact—surprising to his un-
remitting watcher —that he would swallow what
was put in his mouth. But on the morning of the
seventh day the worn-out Beckley was shaken up
by bis Dyak helper. “ See, master ! —see ! ” —and
Beckley saw. The mouth had ceased to dribble ;
and the eyes had speculation in them. But the
hair was grey ! And the first words, in their ap-
parent irrelevance, dashed from the death-fighter’s
face the exultation of victory.
Said Fetherstone, slowly, “Mackenzie’s schooner
—when —is she—due ? ”
“ Let me see,’’said wondering Beckley. “About
the end of next week, I should say.”
“ She takes me back ! ”
* * * *
“But the schooner,” said Beckley, afterwards
telling me the tale, “ didn’t get down to us for a
month, because, meantime, we had the famous
hurricane of that year.”
“Fetherstone did go back north in her, though
—didn’t he ? ”
“Yes. And I’ll answer your next question in
advance. Did I ask him ? Yes! You see, I
didn’t have the chance of going to the fountain-
head, for the hurricane broke the wreck up at last
—drove the sea further in-shore than it had been
for 20 years. So, just as he was going aboard,
I said to Fetherstone, ‘You’re very nearly your-
self again, now, Phil 1 Do you think you could
stand telling me what They were that you cried
out about that night in your horror?’ And then
I cursed myself for asking 1 ”
“Why?'”
“Well, the poor fellow started away from me
as if I had touched him with fire, and looked at
me with a face like death. Then he came back,
and whispered—‘Tell you? There are no words
to do it with / ’ ’’
ALEX. MONTGOMERY.
Connie Gilchrist’s adopted godfather, the
Duke of Beaufort, died the other day at therespect-
able age of 75. He had lived long enough to
become respectable, but in his middle age Beau-
fort was known to the sporting and theatrical
worlds as the naughty mentor of young noblemen.
Thirty odd years ago he helped to make the pace
for the Marquis of Hastings, the young Duke of
Hamilton, and the Duke of Newcastle, all three
of whom got into the clutches of the Israelites.
“ The Marquis ” dissipated himself to death
shortly after his financial collapse. Newcastle
died friendless in a cheap lodging - house at
Boulogne, or somewhere. The Duke of Hamilton’s
vast estates were “ nursed ” for years, and he
came back to sassiety a somewhat reformed noble-
man. All this time Beaufort was enjoying him-
self, as usual. He was a little less imprudent
than his disciples, and he never quite came to
grief. Beaufort always had a nice little “ actress”
or two wearing his diamonds in a snug little
villa, but as he waxed in years the companionship
of sprightly lordlings led to occasional embarrass-
ment concerning the ladies. Instance the case of
a certain young peer (afterwards a jaded Australian
Governor) who became so conspicuously attentive
to one of dear old Beaufort’s “ actresses ” that his
Grace suggested a transfer of the property.
“You are always- haw !—hanging around it,”
said the now elderly sinner, “and I think you
might as well buy the whole bag of tricks.” So
the villa, furniture, equipages, &c., were valued in
an amicable way by the solicitors of the respective
peers, and the delightful lydy changed hands.
Although the late lamented Knight of the Garter
was a gentleman according to his lights, his
paternal example proved disastrous in at least one
case. The Lord Somerset (equerry to the Duke
of Clarence) who figured in the hideous Cleveland-
street scandal, and fled from England, leaving his
army commission to be cancelled, was Beaufort’s
son.
Again, on the selection of firemen :
Dear Bulletin. —“H.R.A.” talks about hook-and-
ladder, but compare the modern fire-escape ladder-a
regular staircase —with the ladders and scaffolds in use
by city painters. Also, ship-rigging, for the safety of the
ship must he strong and durable, whereas, owing to the
cut-and slash style of painting, scaffolding must be quick
and cheap. I have seen men in Sydney standing and
using both hands on swinging scaffolds merely hooked on
to a parapet ; no guard-rail — and a clothes-line as a safety-
line ! Have also seen a man work on a 50ft. ladder when
it took one man to hold it at the top and two men at the
bottom — and he had never been a sailor. Moreover, a
painter will climb over roofs with step-ladders and pots
scoot around chimneys and eaves —eight hours at a
stretch ; yet a fancy sailor-fireman considers it a feat to
carry a mate down the patent staircase called a fire-
ladder. Painters also acquire a sort of instinct as to
windows, doors, ledges, down-pipes, and the like, which
it must take a sailor long to develop. I should like to
set a few sailors to explore—say, the Hotel Metropole—
even without a fire raging.—Jack S.


What the camel - carrying business now
means in Westralia may be roughly reckoned from
a recent count that 2000 animals are engaged on
the Menzies tracks alone. A Camel-Owners’ Asso-

“ Mulga ” : The Sydney dailies give you
practically no news re the state of the country
throughout N.S.W. and Q. ; they tell you only
about the local Sunday-school opening and the
bank-clerk’s departure. The Melb. papers (Melb.
is too enterprising, and wants wiping right out)
give full and accurate information. How is this ?
Prof. Haslam (M.L.), one of Kipling’s
early preceptors, gives that leading idol’s youth-
ful version of a well-known Scriptural event: —
Please, sir, Gawd said to Gideon, “ I say, just you take
a lot of pots and pans and old broken jugs, and anything
that’ll make a row, and go and frighten the Midianites,”
and please, sir, he did, and when the enemy heard the
row they all killed each other, and that was stalky of
him, I think.
Unfortunately, the dominie was also somewhat
“stalky,” and having overheard that Kipling’s
picturesque audacity depended upon a schoolboy
bet, gave Rudyard an impressive lesson upon the
difference between literary styles.

~ , T f lß question is frequently asked—Why are diseases of the kidneys so fatal? The answer is
that diseases of the kidneys are seldom detected until they reach a dangerous stage When the
kidneys become affected there are few alarming symptoms to excite fear, and the disease slowly
extends into the more vital tissues. In the majority of cases the patient does not feel as well as he
should, but he blames it on the weather, overwork, being on his feet too long, or thinks the pain in
ms back is rheumatic. His family doctor advises him to go to the country for a few weeks. He
may feel better when he comes back, but the disease in the kidneys has grown worse every day
though he does not know it. This may continue for months, or even years, before sharp pains in the
back, limbs, or head, or dropsy of the feet and ankles, develop. When that comes, it is too late in
many, cases. *
1 If, then, Kidney Disease be so dangerous, how may I know the symptoms ?To anyone who
may tear he has Kidney Disease, we suggest he write us, and we will send him, free, a little book
that treats of this subject. ’
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills do not cure all diseases. They are for the kidneys, and the

The Secrets of the Moon.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I lie at night and watch her,
As she sails across the sky
With the hidden joys and sorrows
That we know not, you and I;
And I watch her drifting onward
Over crag and dale and dune,
And I wish that I could only .
Hear the secrets of the Moon.
And she moves so brave and queenly
Where her silver clouds are curled,
You would hardly think her freighted
With the cares of all the world ;
If the fairies would be friendly,
If the gods would grant a boon,
Let them softly say me over
All the secrets of the Moon.
She has heard the clink of glasses
Ring to meet her through the stars,
She has loitered by dim gardens
Jlist to light the love-guitars ;
For the night will twine rose-garlands,
And the world’s a brave buffoon,
And we’d learn of love and laughter
In the secrets of the Moon.
She has lingered by Earth’s cradles,
She has kissed the sleeping child,
And has woven such dream-fancies
That he turned to her and smiled ;
She has led the witches’ dances,
Sewn the diamonds on their shoon—
Ah ! Our hearts would grow the younger
For the secrets of the Moon !
She has crossed by many a city,
She has smiled on mosque and tower,
She has heard from many a steeple
Clash the long nights, hour by hour,
While she kissed the wine-wild maidens
In the gilded gay saloon—
Ah ! They’d set a strong man weeping,
Would the secrets of the Moon !
She has topped the tallest mountain,
She has lit the darkest seas,
And the midnight and the morning
They have met upon her knees,
She has heard the night-wind sighing
Songs of love to the lagoon,
And the words the four winds whisper
Are the secrets of the Moon.
And until the Earth is sundered,
And the darkened seas go dry,
She will keep the silver secrets
She has won from earth and sky,
But perhaps when stars are shrouded,
And the night is as the noon,
We shall learn the joys and sorrows
Of the secrets of the Moon !

After Many Years.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Shb met him in her teens, when life’s glamor
was upon them. She was simple and unsophis-
ticated ; he, high-spirited and manly. In her
twenties, they drifted apart in pride and mis-
understanding. The “ eternal love ” of a boy
and a girl became a thing of far-back days.
In her thirties, she one day efttered a railway-
carriage—a smiling, gracious woman of the world.
In the carriage was a single occupant. She bowed
and smiled as she recognised her fellow-traveller,
then sank into a window corner and tried to think
of nothing in particular as she watched the dis-
appearing trees and cottages. It would take two
hours to reach the next station.
How long it was since they had met, and how
dear he had been ! Even now she could feel his
lips upon her hair, and his strong hands imprison-
ing hers. She glanced towards him. What a
look of pain was on his face ! He, too, must be
thinking. Again she looked. Without a word he
held out his arms. Ah ! how sweet the time when
she could creep into them as in a sheltered fold.
Suddenly the weight of years rolled from her.
She was a girl again, and he her king. Throwing
aside her heavy cloak she swept towards him with
a sob that was almost a gasp, and the next moment
was folded close in his embrace, her face buried on
his shoulder.
O, I rank ! ” she cried, “Erank, forgive me.
I did kiss Charlie on the balcony that evening •
but I never thought such a slight sin would bring
so great a punishment.”
“My love,” he answered, “at last we under-
stand each other ! ”
“At last! ” she echoed, as she held up her red
lips for a kiss, and almost unconsciously pushed
the brown curls from off his forehead as in past
days.
“Oh, why was fate so cruel ? Why were we
parted so long ? ”
“ Nothing shall part us again, Nellie.’’
“ No, nothing in Heaven or on earth. lam
yours now, and for ever, and ever.”
Once again were passionate kisses given and re-
turned, once again was the golden head cushioned
on the heart that made so sweet a resting-place.
“ How far are you going, Erank ? ”
. “To the end of the world, pet ; to the very end
of our lives together.”
She lifted her head, and half drew herself from
his arms.
“ What do you mean ? ”
. I mean what you said just now, that nothing
in Heaven or on earth shall take you from me, or
me from you again.”
“ I was mad ! ” she answered. “ But let me
be yours for five minutes longer ; then—love must
die and life end. Kiss me again—again ! ”
The train.whistled. She tore herself from his
arms, threw on her cloak, and took her sunshade
from the rack.
He stood before her, wonder-stricken.
“ Good-bye,” she said, bowing and smiling ; and
the same gracious woman who had entered the
carriage at the last station left it at this; and,
without a trace of emotion on her fair face, joined
her husband and children on the platform.
VICTOR ZEAL.
Romeo—An Equatorial Love-
Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ihe sandalwooders had christened her “ Annie
Laurie.” Why, Heaven alone knows— unless it
was, as Annie herself used often say, “Them
sailors is contrarious brutes.” She was over 50
with short grey hair, small eyes (like a pig’s, ac-
cording to the natives), a flat nose, no neck, and
as fat as a hippopotamus. Where she came from
was a, mystery. Women such as she were occa-
sionally found in the more settled parts of Poly-
nesia, but how did she get down to the New
Hebrides ?
Swum,” was the laconic reply to a delicately-
worded question on this subject. For my part,
I believe she was one of Sydney’s “ nymphs of the
pavement ” carried away by a whaling crew and
left stranded somewhere in Eastern Polynesia,
whence she had worked gradually back, from
island to island, by favor of passing whalers and
traders.
She dealt in sandalwood—then in copra when the
wood became scarce. She also entertained visiting
sailors of course at their own expense. And
when I tell you that her loud, strident voice and
skilful handling of a yam-pole kept her rough
visitors in exemplary order—you will have some
dim idea of the awe with which she was regarded
by the islanders.
A fair-sized block of land surrounded her house
—bought, so she said, from the natives. “ Didn’t
I give yez twenty dollars trade for this bit o’
dirt ? she would demand, and the terror-stricken
creatures would nod vehemently.
Annie had a lover! A passionate, faithful
being- the very model of a lover ! Despite her
frowns, her scorn, and her oft-repeated threats to
knock his brains out (which, by the way, she often
nearly succeeded in doing), he still remained true.
Hung about her house, sitting at the doorway
until ordered to her taro patch. Here he would
work all day and return to his old seat in the
evening. When Annie expected visitors she
kicked him off the step. He would submit with-
out a murmur until his mistress was out of hear-
ing—then the air would become thick with curses
Komeo s past history was as much a puzzle as
that of the object of his affections. He had been
born in Queensland, and, though of what exact
parentage it would be hard to say, he had pro-
bably in him, besides kanaka and Chinese blood
a strain of the white Queenslander.
However that might be, he was quite different
from the natives of the island, and was considered
by them an outcast—in fact, he owed his existence
to the patronage of Annie.
His devotion and Annie’s perverseness were
the joke of the sandalwood-trade, and the sailors
kicked and cuffed the poor brute unmercifully
when they ran across him at the “ Chapel ”—as
Annie’s residence was called. Once, a shellback
meeting him on the beach, kicked him as usual,
but a knife between the ribs convinced this man
and others that JEtomeo was only fair game for
brutality when under the jurisdiction of Annie.
I Beveral times ventured to expostulate with Annie
about her coyness, but always received the same
reply : “ Rot! Raney a woman of my age taking
up with a dirty black ! ” Then I would go to
Romeo, and try to impress upon him the hope-
lessness of his suit, and persuade him to ship for a
cruise with us. But no—he would shake his head,
and Wander back to the doorstep again.
It was “ Big Mitchell ” who cut this romance
short. It’s not a nice story.
Mitchell had onoe been first harpooner on a
whaler, but the long cruises prevented him enjoy-
ing as much women’s society as he wished, so he
was now mate of a sandalwooder. A hulking
great blackguard he was, and even Annie would
not have him in her house unless a couple of others
were there to assist in keeping order. One day
he came ashore drunk and set out for the
Chapel. I was on board at the time, and only
heard of the matter afterwards. Annie met him
at the door.
“ Yez can’t come in,” she said.
“ Well, bring a bottle out here, you hag ! ”
“Not me! Gro an’ask yer skipper.” With an
oath Mitchell rushed at the woman, and, catching
her by the throat, had almost choked her before he
was forced to turn and defend himself from the
furious onslaught of Romeo. There was no fight
—Mitchell’s arm was gashed—but in a moment
the black was whirling in the air, and then, crash-
ing against the bamboo walls, fell in a heap on the
ground.
We patched up the poor fellow as well as we
could, but after all our handiwork a sorrier-look-
ing Romeo never lived. Worse still—he was an
idiot. But he was still the same quiet creature as
of old, except when he saw Annie—then he would
spit at her, gnash his teeth, and hobble away.

“While living at Broken Hill I was subject to lumbago and rheumatism,
having swollen joints which prevented me from working or going about any.
I tried a great many remedies and put out a great many pounds trying to get
rid of my complaints, but to no good. # . _
“As soon as I put my foot on the ground I suffered terrible pain, so I was
obliged to stay in bed for many months.
“ One doctor told me I had the dropsy, and another told me I would have to
lose my leg.
“ But, having heard of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, I decided to try it, and now I am
thankful to say it has completely restored me to health.
“I am now 72 years old, have a splendid appetite, and work hard every
day.” .
Mr. John P\ Jones, of Cobar, New South Wales, sends us this testimonial
with the above portrait of himself. It is the experience of thousands of others
who have had impurities removed from their system by Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
Such testimonies have given to this remedy the name of
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.’’
Sick people may be cured if they will only take the right medicine. The
blood must first be made pure, no matter what the.disease. With pure blood
nature can go ahead and complete the cure.

Dear Sirs,— Being a sutierer for years from fibroid phthisis and bronchitis, I de-

cough, with much expectoration, I have found it to be the most effectual of anything
I have tried. It loosens the mucus, which, therefore, comes more readily away, and
the cough is thereby considerably pacified.
