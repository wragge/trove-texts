HIS
BOOKS
Gloom
The Irish have a Russian genius for
melancholy. Their grim history, their
lovely but sad land, in which life for many
is an unending fight against poverty, and
their mysticism are no doubt responsible.
It has no resemblance to the disillusion and
despair which permeate so many modem
English and American novels. The Irish
preserve their illusions, as a rule, and they
never despair; which may be why the
English never managed to subdue them.
The sadness that runs through all their
folk stories and songs is the resigned sad-
ness of the old who can joke about their
misfortunes because they look to another
world for happiness. Their spiritual plea-
sures are associated chiefly with strife, for
their brand of resignation by no means
implies meekness—strife against what they
regard as tyranny or injustice, and against
ideals which differ from theirs. All these
traits appear in the first of the books re-
viewed this week. In the second we find
essentially the same people—fierce, one-
idea’d mystics—but they are city folk who
have lost their religious beliefs, and, instead
of living in the early days of Lord Salis-
bury’s Coercion Act, they are in conflict
with a Government of their own. The
style of the writers is widely different, but
both are artists, and provide the same atmo-
sphere of w'himsical submissiveness, flaring
up unexpectedly into violence and dying
back to submissiveness, which is the authen-
tic atmosphere of southern Ireland. The
third book has been chosen by way of con-
trast. It is about the best an English
writer can do in this genre, and, though
it is very good in its way, it is below the
others in literary merit.
Pride the Destroyer
All Liam O’Flaherty’s heroes have some
defect, in their natures which brings them
to ruin. In Skerrett (Gollancz: The Rov-
croft, Sydney, 8s.), it is pride. Skerrett is
detestable when, as a powerful, vigorous
man of thirty-five, he arrives from Galway
in the ’eighties of last century to tak
charge of a school on the island of Nara
He despises the job which his marriage to
woman he loathes has forced on him. “Onl}
for you,” he keeps telling her, “I would
be in America now.” He has been chosen
by the parish priest.
Father Harry Moclair was a tall man
over six feet in height, a year older thai
Skerrett, strongly built, handsome in appear
ance, of striking personality. His shavei
face looked subtle and refined, especially his
hawk-like blue eyes, which seemed to smile
continually.
Skerrett begins well. The business of sub-
duing his barbareus scholars, some of whom
are grown men, suits his savage tempera-
ment. After a. stand-up fight with a number
of them, which he .wins, he issues his ulti-
matum. Anyone who comes to school dirty
will be flogged.
‘‘Yes, and I’ll flog your parents too. I’ll
go into your homes and flog everyone in them
if you come here dirty.”
This suits Moclair, whose methods of
imposing discipline are similar. The two
become allies. Skerrett is at peace; men
touch their hats to him. His wife has a
son whom he idolises. And then—disaster.
The child is accidentally killed. His hatred
and jealousy of the masterful priest begin
at the funeral. Moclair, who rules his
people like a king, and is immune to the
weaknesses of the flesh which torture Sker-
rett, has a vice—avarice. Skerrett watches
him while the offerings for the dead are
being made.
“That’s all he really cares for. Money.
He has no thought for my sorrow. See how
he watches the money like a hawk. He
doesn’t suffer.”
His break with the priest is the immediate
origin of hi3 downfall, but it would have
come, anyhow. The furious arrogance
which he lacks the subtlety to hide makes
him a menace. His miserable wife loses
her last hold on life with her child, takes
to drink,, and goes mad. He is pushed down
and down by the relentless priest, who has
no use for failures, loses his job, and then
his reason. Mr. O’Flaherty’s style is as
simple and direct as Swift’s. He doesn’t
explain his characters after the analytical
modern fashion; he lets their actions do it
for him. He scorns sentimentalism or
aathos, but his unemotional pictures of the
islanders and of the sufferings of Skerrett,
who has nobilities
which become
apparent as his end
approaches, are
strangely moving.
A great writer.
Lives Without Purpose
The Dublin revolutionaries of Francis
Stuart’s The Colored Dome (Gollancz; The
Roycroft, Sydney, 8s.) lack the direction
which religion and a capable leader give
the peasants in “Skerrett,” They are with-
moi ' a l standards, or their substitutes in
life s battle, initiative and the capacity for
clear, cynical thinking. Garry Delea is
looking for something, but wliat it is he
doesn’t know; otherwise he wouldn’t be
seeking it with such fervor. “It is the
half-unknown that inspires quests, crusades,
pilgrimages.” Then he is enlightened. Tul-
loolagh, the I.R.A.. woman-general, selects
him and two others to die with her for
tlieir cause. They sign a revolutionary pro-
clamation and he goes to his doom with a
high heart. At last a purpose has emerged
from the futile existence he has been lead-
ing between the betting-shop where he
works and the restaurants where he drinks
and talks. But his problem is not to be
solved on such simple lines; he and Tulloo-
lagh are released. She goes home to her
son, he returns to his .job. He is drinking
m a bar when Michael McEwan, a fellow-
ofhcer of the two signatories who were shot
that morning in place of Tulloolagh and
himself, comes in. He understands what
is troubling McEwan.
The I.ILA. was to be disbanded. All the
objective activity that had been an escape
irorn his tortured, over-sensitive mind was
suddenly cut off Garry Delea felt a
great sympathy for him. Garry Delea too
was searching for a state of simple peace,
for a solution of suffering. A key to the
colored mosaic.... Like others who had
been diawn into the Irish revolutionary
movement neither Garry Delea nor Michael
iVlcLwan was concerned so much with poli-
tical or national ideals, as with' this half-
spiritual, half-emotional quest.
They would have died for their country
gladly, but they find it a bitter trial to
have to live for it, They might have
lived for it gladly under the firm rule of
someone like Father Moclair, but there is
no such clear-headed dictator in sight.
They are fated to wander about, pitying
one another, after the irresolute manner
of people in a mist.
Mr. Stuart s writing has a wild beauty
oi its own, but it is self-conscious beauty
which is always rather trying. Most of
his characters are trying, too—muddled
drifters without a redeeming touch of Irish
humor. The most likeable is “the Captain ”
a friendly, hard-bitten squire whose
thoughts centre on steeplechasing, fishing
and billiard-playing. Any community in
the world will recognise him, for his type
is universal. . “
Homicidal Mania
Nightmare, by Lynn Brock (Collins;
7s. 6d.), concerns the horrors which befell
the people who shared the same block of
nats as Simon Whalley. They might have
happened to any group , that had the ball
luck to come in contact with a shell-shock
case of the kind. He wants to finish a
novel and the thoughts won’t come for
he is already on the verge of a breakdown.
■p e 1 ., anc ls adored wife have incurred the
dislike of the Prossips, who live above. As
he sits idle at his desk, thumping .founds
reach his. anguished ears. Fat Marjory
Prossip and her sluttish maid are leaping
up and down to annoy him. Their gramo-
phone blares and the leaping begins again,
lhe landlord won’t interfere. In despera-
tion he moves to a cottage where his wife
dies—murdered, as he argues, by his
enemies. What more just than that he
should murder all of them? He does so.
and incidentally ruins several unfortunates
who bear him no ill-will. The only part
of the story which is hard to credit‘is the
boorishness of the Prossips and the land-
iord but there are such people even in
P? 11 *:® England. The gradual disintegration
of Whalley s fine mind is described in
masterly deftail. Le Farm himself never
created an atmosphere of impending disaster
with greater skill.

evolved from that transplanted bit of Eng-
land in fifty years. Listen to the avenue
down which their thoughts are slipping,
while around them rise the congratulations
of friend and neighbor, who have travelled
to this celebration along
A pleasant road, with many a wide-ranged sight
Of mountains’ purple empire, and the bright
Tranquillity below.
But underneath the vast arched summer sail
These two hear little... ;
Hand placed in hand, they wander back alone ;
Back to the little Cotswold house of stone;
Beauty and peace ringed with the steel of caste,
The close horizon and the life held fast —
And see the family living-room;—
The square French-windowed sitting-room:
Plush chairs, wax fruit and fresh roses bloom.
The great Queen reigns there on the fireplace wall;
“Gordon at Bay”; a wool-worked waterfall;
“Bubbles” and “Autumn Leaves” and “Squire of
Dames.”
These people, set in a kindly countryside,
are familiar to Mr. Mulgan; he writes of
them with intimacy, but instead of filling
the reader with a sense of serenity after
storm he conveys more the atmosphere
of uneventfulness. Now and again there
are flashes of something like genius in his
descriptions:—
This house is apple-me110w....
This house of wood
Sits like a quiet old woman in the sun,
White-capped and aproned, folded hands, and eyes
Holy with self-forgotten charities.

bourne) is full of ideas. Fancies crowd;
the writer thinks, and has something to
say about everything. He can round a
thought neatly in a few lines:—
Singing, I lived at peace with life,
And, singing still, must now depart.
Lost were the sounds of toil and strife
In the wild music of my heart.
He has a heart quick to tears and laughter,
a happy fancy, and a neat turn of phrase,
and he isn’t afraid to kneel down and say
a prayer. So we get the spirituality of
“The Swagman Camps on Christmas
Night”:—
The way is one, the end is one,
And still the track keeps running on
From change to further change.
No haste there is, no haste at all;
Forever loveliness shall call.
Blue stands the distant range.
How high we are! No murmur tells
Of the world below where mankind dwells.
The camp-fire digs in the dark a pit
And the friendly punctual stars are lit;
Great stars whose light once showed the way
To the Three who sought where Jesus lay,
Lay as an infant small and white—
Awake, ,my soul, it is Christmas night!
There are memories of Milton in Lilacs
Out of the Dead Land, by Edgar Holt
(Melbourne Transition Press). The open-
ing sonnet depicts the melancholy Dane,
still brooding over his doubts and fears,
and in revolt against spending eternity in
acceptance of the final word, plunging to
Hell. This is one of those books so over-
larded with conscious cleverness that the
reader only gives it credit for cleverness
with an effort. Consider a stanza from
“World’s End”:—
Scheherazade beyond the zone
Of sensual nights festooned with death
Relates the epic of the world.
The words are golden on her breath.
Here are four lines from a sonnet, clear,
and with a lingering cadence:—
The shining music of a faith which springs
Out of the hearts of men, that there shall be
Freedom once more, with such unburdened wing?
That man shall rise to find humanity.
From Singapore comes The Temple of
Night, by C. E. H. Jacobs. Many of his
verses are religious on somewhat obvious
lines; as in “Jesus Was a Carpenter”:—
Jesus is the carpenter
Of the souls of men;
With God’s tools he fashions them,
Builds them up again ;
Greater than the churches,
Mightier than the creed,
Lives the Asiatic Jew
Serving human need.
Here is a pretty compliment to Penang
Gardens:—
Come, let us look on beauty’s face
And feel the heart beat in her breast,
I know a very lovely place
Where life may find a rest.
And waterfall and lily pond
Dwell in the shade of leafy boughs.
This is a book without any startling
beauties of line or thought, but many of its
little songs will bring comfort to uncomplex
minds.
NORA MCAULIFFE.
Where Are We Going?
It is fortunate when an artist knows in
his heart what he is intending to do: for-
tunate for himself and for us, as audience,
in the long run. It is immediately fortunate
for us when an artist is able to be articulate
about his aims, as Mr. F. W. Davison
was at the English Association’s last annual
meeting in Sydney. The speech might have
stood as a reply taken down by an un-
commonly neat interviewer who had called
to ask Mr. Davison just why he had written
“Man-Shy,” the rarely beautiful novel to
which the Australian Literature Society
awarded its fourth annual medal.
What he said in reply to the toast of
Australian Literature was clear and con-
vincing, dealing with subject matter on
which we hear a great deal that is dark
and bewildering. A national literature, he
declared, had three aims. The first and
highest was to interpret the life of a
country for its people. (This—the audi-
ence here breaks in—has been bravely done
® ‘ “Man-Shy”) The second and more
difficult aim was _to carry out the effort,
aitei the first, in such a distinguished
manner as to make the life of that country
of interest to readers in other lands.
(More difficult, is it? Well, “Man-Shy”
has done it in one, for it is as translatable
and universal a book as has ever come
out of Australia: as broad as a folk-tale.)
The third and commonest aim was to make
writing a commercial success. (All power
to him! Angus and Robertson are bring-
ing out a new edition of “Man-Shy” this
week.)
Then, warming to his theme, he analysed
the situation to-day. It would not be diffi-
cult, he said, for the more skilled writers of
this country to achieve commercial success
by making their leading characters English
or American, and by carefully showing them
in a flattering light. Numbers of novels
written about Rhodesia, South Africa, the
Malay States, Shanghai and so forth en-
joyed a ready sale. But the authors of
these novels were English or American;
they wrote of English or American
people abroad, and for the entertainment
of English and Americans at home. If
they attempted to portray the life of these
countries from the viewpoint of their own
inhabitants, there would be an instant falling
off in sales in the English or American
market; unless, indeed, the books were
written with such consummate skill as to
command the attention of lovers of literature
everywhere. That was what the more sin-
cere group of Australian literary workers
was trying to do.
These were his own credo and his march-
ing orders. He is right in supposing them
to be shared by the more eager of his
fellow-craftsmen.
NETTIE PALMER.
A National Song
Apropos the National Song Competition,
an old contributor, “10-2-4,” expresses an
individual opinion:—
A characteristic of the best-known national
anthems is their sameness. Most of them could be
sung to “God Save the King,” and a number are
sung to that somewhat dull and plodding air. The
exceptions are the songs of small and often invaded
countries like Belgium and Ireland, which have a
note of plaintive sorrow. A sincere Australian
anthem shouldn’t express devotion to a royal family,
for we have never personally known one; nor
martial pride, for we have only been martial at
intervals; nor gloom, for our existence as a nation
has been pleasant, on the whole. So the perfect
anthem when it arrives, if it ever does, should,
anyhow, be unusual; as unlike a traditional European
one as our native animals are unlike those of
Europe. And, for that very reason, it is more likely
to be the work of one who feels deeply and indi-
vidually than of a writer whose chief asset is
technical skill.
The competition closes on November 16.
A first prize of £25 is offered; there is a
second prize of £lO, with five consolation
prizes of £1 each. Words only of the song
are asked for. The Bulletin and Woman’s
Mirror reserve the right to publish any of
the entries, and will allow the prize-winners
to be set to music and sung without royalty.
Entries are free, and any number.may be
sent by any one writer. They must be
signed with pen-names (with the real names
in separate sealed envelopes), and addressed
“Song Competition,” Bulletin Office, Box
252188, G.P.0., Sydney. The winners will
probably be announced in The Bulletin
issue of December 14.
A Satchel of Books
The Orchid, by Robert Nathan (Elkin
Mathews; 7s. (id. net). The author of “The
Woodcutter’s House” writes a novel like a
smooth poem, charming, suggestive, but
without much profundity. An artist, a
musician and the proprietor of a merry-go-
round and their lady-loves in a small Ameri-
can town are drawn with a gentle and sym-
pathetic hand.
Six feet in height, broad of shoulder and
lean of waist, and the possessor of two
silver-mounted guns. There you have the
plans and specifications for a Charles Wes-
ley Sanders hero, and we meet him again
in Cavalier of the West (Wild West Club;
7s. 6d.) Pat McCann is the name this
time, and the girl he gets after disposing
of the trouble that blew up from the Circle
B ranch is lovely Lucy Lampson.
Old Books for the New Young (Hoine-
mann; 3s. 6d.) was written by Gillian
Hansard when she was 14. It consists of a
collection of short biographies, with critiques
attached, of writers from Goldsmith to
Wells. Like this :
Lots of people nowadays don’t like Dickens, but
you may be one who does. His books are very long,
because in those days there were fewer and longer
stories, which I think is rather a bore, as just as
you are getting to the interesting parts there is a
long chapter that seems to have nothing to do with
the story.
Not very helpful to the young, but it should
get plenty of friendly grins from the old.
Wrath on the Way, by Freeman Wills
Crofts (Collins; 7s. 6d.), is a well-built
thriller about a railway job in Dorset. The
murderer is again one of the last you would
have imagined. The technical knowledge
shown by some of these writers of shockers
is staggering. To write this one, for ex-
ample, Mr. Crofts must have picked up
nearly all there is to know about the finan-
cial side of tunnel-widening and viaduct-
building in his native land. His character-
isation and dialogue are as sound as ever.
Sergeant Sir Peter (Chapman and Hall;
7s. 6d.) is one of the last characters to be
created by Edgar Wallace. Peter had been
a bobby before he became a bart., so Scot-
land Yard, where he had proved his worth
as a sleuth, begged him not to leave a vacant
chair around the family hearth. As Sir
Peter he investigates many mysteries, among
them the one of “The Four Missing Mer-
chants.” This has a laugh instead of a dead
body in it. There is grimness enough about
“The Principles of Jo Loless” and “Buried
Treasure,” though. A fine assortment, in
which suspense and mirth are cleverly mixed.

Sydney, November 16.
A THIRTY-HOUR WEEK.
It has been proposed by a conference pro-
fessing to speak for organised labor in
Australia that a 30-hour week should be
aimed at. Well, there is no doubt at all
that in 30 hours out of every 168 a man can
produce enough to satisfy his absolute
needs. The South Sea Islander can manage
it in much less time than that; and he has
very few tools to help him. Nearer home
the “Murrumbidgee whaler” might show
even the kanaka a point or two in economi-
sing work. There is indeed scarcely any
limit to the possible shortening of the hours
of toil. Everything depends on the degree
to which one is prepared to shorten his
needs.
On the other hand, man can cultivate his
wants almost without limit. Our grand-
fathers occupied houses which the health
inspector would to-day pronounce unfit for
human habitation. In Bristol at the begin-
ning of last century half the population
belonged to families which lived in one
room. Just 100 years ago—in 1832—a special
board of health appointed during a cholera
epidemic inspected 4572 houses in one dis-
trict in Manchester and found that 1649
of them were without lavatory accommoda-
tion in any form. Sixty years ago in Aus-
tralia it was estimated that only one house
in 60 had a sewing machine, and it is
doubtful whether one in a hundred had any
sort of musical instrument save such as
might be taken in the hand. To-day the
piano, the gramophone and the wireless are
happily not the monopolies of the rich:
indeed, the poor seem to treasure them
more highly than the affluent who can buy.
other pleasures. Fifty years ago the work-
ing-man and his family probably did not
patronise a theatre oftener than three times
a year, and there were tens of thousands
that never saw a theatre at all; it might
not be setting it too high to say that
the average Australian working-man’s
family to-day regards at least one visit to
the pictures per week as a necessity.
The Bulletin makes no complaint about
all this; on the contrary, it hopes that
such things are only a beginning. Far
too many so-called luxuries are still the
monopolies of the rich. The working-man
has emerged from the one-roomed tenement
“without lavatory accommodation in any
form,” and with doubtful water drawn
from a public cistern in the unswept street;
he occupies now something more sanitary,
yet for the most part it is almost without
comfort. Why should he and his family
be satisfied with mere shelter when there
is so much of other things that- money can
buy? Has not the toiler in the workshop
or factory as much need of the easy chair
as the merchant or the banker? Could he
not take as much pleasure in it? Why
should not his home have its treasured
books and its beautiful pictures? Why
should he not have joy in health and com-
fort in sickness?
What is behind this constant struggle of
a certain section of the Trades Hall to
cut down the hours of labor? There was
plenty of justification for the attack on the
old 10- and 11-hour day. The human frame
was not built to carry such a strain. But
there is no longer any suggestion that the
hours of labor are excessive from the point
of view of the physical well-being of the
worker. All that is put forward now is
that labor is an affliction and the less a
man does of it the happier he must be.
But why is that view put forward? These
men must know—and of course they do
know—that the world cannot have more
than it produces. They must know—and
of course they do know—that if the world
produces more, the worker has a chance of
getting more: somebody must get it, and it
rests with him and his organisations to see
that he gets his full share. If, on the other
hand, more is not produced, then it is the
most obvious thing in the world that
neither he nor anybody else can get it.
It looks, therefore, as though there are men
at the Trades Hall who do not want the
worker to get more—who, on the con-
trary, would be best pleased if he had to
fight hard to keep what he has. This,
of course, is the policy of the revolutionary
always and everywhere. Discontent is the
only soil in which his upas-tree flourishes.
But, it may be argued, what is the use
of producing more—the world produces too
much already? The world does not pro-
duce too much already. It only produces
too much of certain things. And, after all,
these certain things are very few in number,
and nearly all of them raw materials—
wheat, rubber, coffee, sugar, most of the
metals. What has happened is that the
production of these things has been so
mechanised during the last few years that
output has been accelerated faster than the
industry could throw off its surplus pro-
ducers. There has been a gradual throwing-
off of excess producers in most of these
industries for many years—in grain-growing
especially. At one time it took 75 p.c.
of the population to produce food and cloth-
ing material for the world; to-day it calls
for probably not quite 25 p.c. The other
50 p.c. has had to be absorbed otherwise.
Generally the change has been marked by
a steady flow from the country to the
towns, which have presented new opportuni-
ties for labor; on this occasion the excess
grew so rapidly that the rural industries
did not throw it all off, but continued pro-
duction, accelerating it. as a set-off against
falling prices; and when they could no
longer find a profitable market for their
rural goods, the market for the goods of
millions of the urban industries crashed,
too. The world will recover when occupa-
tions get into proper relation again. Then,
just as hitherto the excess has been absorbed
into new industries or in improving old
ones, the present excess will be absorbed
in still further increasing the world’s com-
forts and amenities. There is no necessity
to reduce working hours in order to find
work for the surplus; those who suggest
such a course assume that the workers of
the world have all the comforts they need,
and all the pleasures they can enjoy. Either
that or these people plot to keep the
worker from getting pleasures which he
might have and could enjoy in order to
advance their own revolutionary plans.
THE NATION’S BUSINESS.
One of the most exasperating features of
the average Parliamentary debate in these
days is the obvious insincerity of so many
of the speeches. On the part of a large
proportion of members there is no serious
attempt at honest debate, no serious effort
to thresh the matter out and reach a
sound conclusion. Whether members of
this type have troubled to form any real
opinions on the subject before them is
doubtful: why, indeed, should they trouble
to have real opinions when they know that
all they will expect of themselves is to
find reasons for supporting the measure if
they are on the Government side and for
opposing it if they are in Opposition?
Parliament ought to be and in theory is
a body in which citizens meet, in the per-
sons of their representatives, to talk over
their business and decide upon how it is
to be done: how important this business is
may be judged from a statement contained
in the Budget speech delivered in Sydney
last week to the effect that the State ex-
penditure alone in N. S. Wales amounted
for the year just past to 34 p.c. of the whole
national income. Yet it is perfectly safe to
say that there are scores of politicians in
N. S. Wales alone who regard themselves
not as men transacting business, but as
gamblers playing for their bread and butter.
Their business is, not to do the work of
the country, but, if they are in, to stay
in; Jf they are out, to turn the tables upon
their adversaries and recover control of the
tart-shop. The other side may have pro-
posed something which would have received
their warmest approval if it had been pro-
posed by their own side; having been
brought forward by the other side, it has
to be pilloried and every effort made to
stop it from being carried into effect. If
it is carried into effect the results, which
would have been entirely satisfactory if
their own party had been responsible for
the measure, have to be shown to be un-
utterably bad. What sort of a way of doing
business is this? What commercial concern
could last a year if its Board of Directors
handled its affairs on those lines?
If a body of serious business men were
faced with such a position as that in which
N. S. Wales is to-day floundering, it is in-
credible that it would treat a proposal to
reduce their fees as the N.S.W. Government
Caucus is said to have treated the Ministry’s
proposal regarding Parliamentary allow-
ances last week. Members now get £705 a
year; it was proposed to reduce this by
15 p.c.—which would have left members
with double the allowance of a few years
ago, and with 50 p.c. more than the English
M.P. draws. The party meeting rejected this
proposal in favor of one to reduce the cut to
12s. 6d. per week, the amount by which
the basic wage was recently reduced from
£4 2s. 6d. Had the party resisted any
cut at all it would have deserved less
disrespect than it has earned by sheltering
behind the reduction in the basic wage.
The great mistake at the back of it all is
that we continue to treat membership of
these State Parliaments as a whole-time job,
whereas it should be a job for no more
than 50 or 60 days in the year, paid for at
the rate of, say, £4 a day plus, actual travel-
ling expenses. Our present system has
created a tribe of professional politicians
who, having no other means of livelihood,
put themselves first; and, because each de-
pends upon his party for political life, he
is the slave of his party, instead of the busi-
ness representative of the people. The
result we see in the financial mess out of
which we are dragging ourselves so slowly
and so painfully.
THE CASE OF THE LITTLE SISTERS.
The case of the Little Sisters demands more
calm attention than it has had. High Pro-
tection is the settled policy of Australia:
the question is, Can we maintain it without
doing an injustice to States which for one
reason and another are handicapped as re-
gards manufactures? And if it can be
maintained, how is it to be done?
It is fairly obvious that Westralia, S,
Australia and Tasmania in that order are
handicapped. In 1904 these three had 19.21
p.c. of the total number of factory em-
ployees in the Commonwealth; in 1929 —
to take the last year before the crash—
they had only 15.1 p.c. Westralia had 536
per 10,000 of its average population in 1904
in secondary industries; in 1929 it had only
495. Meantime the proportion in N. S.
Wales had gone from 472 to 729, and in
Victoria from 632 to 880. The figures for
the other two States in the Little Sisters
group are not as bad as those for West-
ralia; but they are not satisfactory. In
19.04 Australia had 515 factory-workers per
10,000 of population, and in 1929 it had 703.
It thus added 188 per 10,000 of population.
South Australia added only 63 and Tas-
mania 34; Westralia actually lost 41.
Whether they have suffered as much as
some of their people profess to believe is,
however, another matter. It is not at all
clear that they would have done any better
so far as increase of factories and factory
population is concerned without Federation.
In S. Australia, for instance, in the eight
years from 1892 onwards to the birth of
Federation, there was an increase of 34 p.c.
in the number of factory-workers. In the
eight years after Federation there was an
increase of 49 p.c. The figure reached its
highest in 1926-27, when it was more than
double that of 30 years earlier. In other
words, more factory-workers were added in
S. Australia during these 20 years of Federa-
tion than in the first six years of Federa-
tion and all the 64 years before Federation
arrived. Statistics from the other two
States of the Little Sisters group are im-
perfect; but there is no reason to believe
from those available that Federation has
impeded their progress as manufacturers
any more than it has that of S. Australia.
That, however, is not the point taken,
especially in Westralia. What is alleged is
that heavy duties are collected which
cannot possibly do any good to these Little
Sisters—that their cost of living is increased
without any corresponding advantage or
hope of advantage. They may be willing
to admit that the primary producers of the
industrial States may benefit by the
market provided by their own factory-
workers; Westralia insists that it gets no
benefit at all from that market, while S.
Australia and Tasmania say that they bene-
fit hardly at all. Westralia says in effect:
“We admit that neither geographically nor
otherwise are we cut out to be a manufac-
turing people. When we pay Customs
duties, therefore, we pay them merely to
benefit people in other States, and to the
great disadvantage of our own primary
industries, whose costs are heightened by
these charges.” South Australia and Tas-
mania say much the same thing, but with
less emphasis.
No doubt it is quite open to the indus-
trial States to reply that, since High Pro-
tection suits them as a national policy, High
Protection it is going to be so long as they
have the power to enforce it. Such an
attitude, however, besides being liable to
be grossly unfair to other members of the
Federation, would imperil High Protection
as a national policy. It may be true that
the great industrial States have nothing to
fear from the handful of members from
the smaller States in the Federal Parlia-
ment. But it has td be remembered that
there is more sympathy between many of
the country members of the industrial
States and the small States than there is
between those members and the industrial
members of their own States; it is the
union of these two forces which lately has
been bringing great pressure to bear upon
the Lyons-Latham Government to secure the
remission of some duties and the reduction
of others, and that pressure will certainly be
increased. Yet there never was a time when
it was so necessary to preserve and extend
the manufacturing industries. World figures
show the shocking weakness of the position
of the primary industries; and the further
mechanisation is carried the weaker will
they be. The future is for those industries
which are not over-producing—those newer
industries which add to the comforts, the
amenities and the pleasures of life. ’
So we come to two conclusions: (1)
That it would be disastrous for Australia
to abandon or even greatly modify the
policy of High Protection; but (2) that
that, policy does bear hardly upon the
smaller States by increasing their costs
without giving them any very substantial
advantages. In view of this and of the
serious effect it is alleged to have had on
their finances, the Little Sisters have of
recent years been constant suppliants for
relief from the Commonwealth. There is.
however, no body clothed with any autho-
rity to inquire into the claims, and for
the most part they have been dealt with
according to the amount of political pres-
sure which could be thrown behind them.
The grants have been regarded therefore
sometimes as doles, sometimes almost as
blackmail; and almost invariably they have
been preceded by outpourings of bitter-
ness, accompanied occasionally by threats
of secession. The position is entirely un-
satisfactory. Three years ago Tasmania
asked tor the appointment of a standing
Inter-State Commission or some such body
whose job it would be to inquire into and
report to the Parliament on the financial
relations of Commonwealth and States; and
the federal Accounts Committee itself
approved of such a body. There i s all the
more reason for it because the Senate has
altogether failed of its original purpose as
a States’ House.
"HUMANITARIANISM."
There has been a great deal of confused
thinking and abusive oratory, in Parliament
and elsewhere, on the subject of old-age
pensions, unemployed-relief and the like.
It has been a maxim of English policy for
centuries that no subject of the King shall
be allowed to perish for lack of food, cloth-
ing or shelter where means of succor were
available. Now and then (especially during
the rise of the Freetrade superstition), the
duty has been ineptly or callously dis-
charged, but since the days of the Tudors
there has never been a time when it was
not generally accepted; and to this perhaps
more than anything else England owes
its long immunity from social revolution.
Of recent years in Britain most of the
responsibility has been taken over from the
local authorities by the State. But the
principle that it is a function of the State
to care for all those in distress is by no
means universally accepted. Many coun-
tries have no old-age pension system; few
pay pensions to invalids or widows. The
U.S.A., with its 10 million unemployed, has
no dole.
Australia naturally followed the humane
English custom; but it has gone a great, deal
further than the English. It is paying
out a large part of its revenues, got by
terrific taxation of a small minority, in
doles, pensions (old-age, invalid, widows',
military, Judges’, police, railwaymen’s,
tramwaymen’s and those of other civil
servants), child-endowment and child-wel-
fare benefits. The British workman, when
he has a job, contributes to what he gets
when idle; his dole is, in effect, part of an
insurance scheme, whereas ours is a free
gift. Queensland, moreover, is paying “the
full basic wage, with margins,” for relief
work of small economic value; and N. S.
Wales did the same under Lang. Lang
really did more; he maintained the N.S.W.
basic wage at an artificial figure for 18
depression months by throwing a spanner
into the State wage-fixing, machine. At the
same time, while stinting single men and
childless married couples, he gave unem-
ployed family men the dole, child-
endowment and, in some eases, child-welfare
allowances; so that they w T ere getting up to
£3 15s. a week for doing nothing. The
Auditor-General has shown how he managed
it: “The total borrowings during the year
amounted to £21,829,200, of which £13,090,400
was used to provide for cash deficiencies on
revenue account.” In short, all this bene-
volence was borrowed.
The Commonwealth Government, for its
part, leaned on the banks to the extent of
£10,166,100, largely to pay old-age. and
invalid pensions. This expenditure has for
years past been equal to, sometimes greater
than, the entire Federal income-tax revenue,
though Federal income tax has soared to
9s. 6d. in the £. Last year old-age and
invalid pensions cost .£11,126,000, whereas
this year’s yield from the income tax that
goes up to 9s. 6d. in the £ is reckoned at
£10,000,000. Yet when the worried Govern-
ment proposed to reduce the maximum rate
of pension, which nearly every beneficiary
gets, to what it was in 1920, when things
were much dearer, there was such a hue and
cry that, not being remarkable for courage,
the Government said it would leave the
maximum rate at 17s. 6d. a week. Now,
when it talks of setting inquiries in motion
to prove whether half the old people in
Australia are really destitute and have no
families who could help them, it is accused
of contemplating “an outrage on the child-
ren of our pioneers,” of desiring still to
“grind the faces of the old-age pensioners,”
of being robbers and repudiators and w'hat
not. Actually there can be no robbery
or repudiation ’ in this matter. The
nation undertook in 1914 “to care for him
who shall have borne the battle, and for his
widow and orphan,” and it is discharging
this trust; but it entered into no such con-
tract with the old-age pensioners. If they
elect to receive money from it instead of
food, clothing and shelter, it can give them
no more than it can fairly afford. It has
been trying to give them more and is risk-
ing disaster in the process. There, are
nine and ninety ways in which a country
can go broke, and being generous with
borrowed money is ninety of them.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Budget.
Considering the depth of the pit into winch
NT. S. Wales was dragged by the Lang Gov-
ernment, the outlook as disclosed by the
Budget and other figures last week is quite
encouraging. The expenditure in 1931-32.
Lang’s last year, was £56,644,634; the
revenue £42,416,790, leaving an appalling
deficit of £14,227,844, reduced to £12,484.798
if certain amounts not properly chargeable
to the year are struck out. For the current
year Stevens estimates a deficit of £4,350,000.
Bringing the figures together:—
Lang’s Stevens’s
Actual. Estimate.
Revenue .. ..£42,410,790 £45,185,082
Expenditure .. •• 54,901,588 *9,585,083
Deficit .. '..£12,484,798 £4,850,000
Now, a deficit does not just: happen: either
you must leave your debts unpaid or you
must borrow the money to pay them with.
A country cannot leave its debts unpaid
without smashing its credit and producing
financial collapse; therefore the banks were
compelled to pay Lang’s bills. I he result
is a floating debt—temporary accommoda-
tion squeezed out of the banks —of no
less than £37,860,000, accumulated in
two years. In the current year interest on
this has to be paid; sinking fund also must
be provided; and because our exchange rate
is being held up allegedly, in the interests
of the primary producers, the taxpayer has
to provide £2,420,000 under this heading, the
amount added to our overseas interest bill.
These three items account for most of the
four millions-odd for which we shall have
to go into debt this year. By comparison
with what we had to face for two years it,
is highly satisfactory; it represents the dif-
ference between an obvious effort to pre-
serve the solvency of the State and, if not
an obvious effort to smash it in the interests
of the “revolution” which Mr. Lang so
warmly welcomed, at least an obvious un-
concern whether it was smashed or not.
Stevens, it will be seen, estimates that he
will get in nearly three millions more
revenue, notwithstanding some small remis-
sions of taxation and charges. The result
looks possible, and if it is possible it is
entirely to the credit of a Government
whose policy has gone a good way towards
rebuilding that confidence which had been
not only smashed but ground into the dirt
under the heel of the Lang Government.
To reduce the terrible gap between
receipts and expenditure the Treasurer
must, nevertheless, trust chiefly to a reduc-
tion of outgoings. There is an expected
saving here of five millions; but since most
of it is due to the fall in prices and the
cost of living, no great credit can be given
to the Government for the performance.
The real economy has hardly begun: the
saving due to a fall in prices is not real
economy, because it is offset by a shrinkage
in the national income and in individual
earnings. It may be that the time is
inopportune for a radical reduction of the
public service, but so soon as opportunities
for employment elsewhere are developed
this problem must be attacked in the inter-
ests of the grossly overbui’dened taxpayer.
—4
The Victorian Budget.
While the N. S. Wales Treasurer cannot
see his way clear to bring the deficit for
the current year below £4,350,000. the Gov-
ernment expects to show that Victoria is
no more than £850,000 to the bad; for the
past year the total was £1,608,322. But
while the N. S. Wales figures thus over-
shadow-those of Victoria, there is some con-
solation for the senior State in the fact
that, while Dr. Argyle budgets for a reduc-
tion of 47 p.c. in the deficit compared with
last year’s figure, Mr. Stevens believes he
can promise a cut of no less than 62 p.c.
From one point of view the Victorian
position is easier than that of N. S. Wales.
Hogan, Argyle’s predecessor, did have some
compunction about levying taxes; Stevens’s
predecessor had none. Stevens can there-
fore find no justification for adding so much
as a penny to the excessive taxation and
charges already borne by his people;
Argyle is able to get a little help from that
source. After making what he believes to
be all feasible reductions in expenditure,
he would still show a deficit of £1,440.000
if all taxes and charges were left as they
were; by increasing the number of income-
tax payers from 110,000 to 400,000, by in-
creasing the rate of stamp duty on betting-
tickets for £3 or over, by raising the stamp
duty on cheques from ltd. to 2d., and by
various small variations he expects to pro-
duce another £590.000, thus reducing the
deficit to the £850,000.
Opposition-leader Tunnecliffe. following
the Treasurer, declared that the Budget was
“a rich man’s Budget,” as the stupid con-
ventions of his office demanded that he
should do. The major offence of the Gov-
ernment, of course, is that it has decided
to make an emergency call upon those in
receipt of the smaller incomes. Hitherto
of 470,000 persons in receipt of incomes in
Victoria only 110,000 have yielded any part
of them in direct taxation. The Govern-
ment most rightly says that only those in
receipt of the very smallest incomes should
wholly escape: indeed, a? a matter of prin-
ciple. it is doubtful whether anvone at all
should wholly escape. We have fallen into
the easy way of thinking there is a hidden
spring from which revenue can be drawn,
and. as a result, all sorts of so-called social
services _ have been unloaded upon the
community, all sorts of extravagances in-
dulged in. It is in the highest degree neces-
sary to impress upon the people—upon all
the people—that there is only one source
of revenue, the pockets of the people; and
there is no way of doing it except by
making every unit in the community
directly responsible for his share of the
outlay. The amount is of little conse-
quence; the Victorian Government does
well to ask those who receive from £lOO
to £lOOO a year to pay, by way of this
emergency tax, only 6s. in the £100; and
as the unemployment relief tax is reduced
by 10 p.c.., actually the taxpayer is no
worse off by reason of the emergency in-
come tax. The Bulletin's only complaint
is that the charge has been branded an
emergency tax. The unemployment relief
tax is an emergency tax and has always
been so regarded; the opportunity might
well have been taken to lift a small part
of it out of the emergency class, and make
it a regular part of the citizen’s contribu-
tion to the cost of government. Even the
small child in the well-regulated household
has his small task to do, his small contribu-
tion to make to the domestic economy;
and the poorest member of the community
ought to feel, and ought to be proud to
feel, that he is bearing his share of the
cost of government. We have no right to
say that he cannot afford it. It ought to
be regarded as being as much a part of
his regular outgoings as the money he pays
the butcher, the landlord or the lodge.
“Socialisation.”
Communism having fallen into disrepute,
the Soviet leaders in Australia do not men-
tion it any more. Nowadays they preach
“socialisation” and cany it into effect
when they can. It is the same thing under
an alias.
The leaders in Europe have rarely called
themselves Communists: the Russian
leaders never have. They have all along
been engaged in “socialisation” or “col-
lectivisation.” Russia’s chief executive
organisation is the Council of the People’s
Commissaries, whose chairman, Molotov,
stands next to Stalin. He wrote lately that
“1 he principal task of Socialism is to abolish
capitalism. This signifies the complete
liquidation of the capitalistic elements.”
And the Seventeenth Party Conference—the
official voice of the Soviet party—announced
the main objective of the. Second Five-
Year Plan :-
Our fundamental objective is the final liquidation
of the capitalistic elements and the class system,
the obliteration of the capitalistic survivals and the
transformation of the entire working population
of the country into self-conscious and active builders
of a classless socialist society.
Among the particular objects aimed at is
the “socialisation” of all farms. Molotov
expands the manifesto in this regard:—
We have already over 60 p.c. of the peasant
farms, and there can be no doubt that the party
decision virtually to complete the collectivisation
of the countryside by the close of 1932-33 will be
realised.
And there is to be more, of course, than
the expropriation of the farms. All other
“capitalistic elements” are to be “liqui-
dated”—“complete liquidation” is the
policy. This means the seizure of all
savings bank deposits, among other things;
it means that, after paying into his lodge
or his insurance office for many years, a
man’s credit with that body will be seized
—“liquidated” in the phrase of these people,
who are great humbugs as well as great
thieves. When in Lang’s administration in
N. S. Wales the State Savings Bank closed
its doors it was thought to be one of the
very unfortunate results of bad times. But
the party of “socialisation” aims at the
closing of savings banks. Like the rest they
are “capitalistic elements” and must be
abolished: there is no such thing as a
savings bank in all Russia and no such
thing as an insurance office or benefit
society.
The people know pretty well no>w what
Communism means—that it involves first
the robbery of all who have practised
thrift, followed by a form of slavery either
thinly disguised or not disguised at all.
So the old well-known name is dropped,
and we get instead a programme of
“socialisation.” As we have seen, however,
it is the old wolf in a stolen sheepskin.

A Man Who Made the World Larger.
The work of the late Sir Ronald Ross, dis-
coverer of the carrier of malaria, was a bril-
liant triumph of the modern deductive
method in science over the old method of
induction. Before Ross it had been dis-
covered that the mosquito-net was a pre-
ventive of the dread disease which was
wiping out British regiments, coolie camps
and white Administrators all over the
world; but the connection between the net
and the mosquito was not seen. It was
thought that a closely-woven net kept out
the miasma which was believed to cause
malaria. Miasma and malaria were, in fact,
regarded as synonymous terms.
When Ross began, Dr. Laveran had
already identified the malarial germ, and
Ross’s friend and mentor, the great Pat-
rick Manson, had put forward the sugges-
tion that mosquitoes were the original
host. Accepting this suggestion as a work-
ing basis. Ross set out to discover the
germ in the body of the insect; but there
were dozens of different kinds of mosquito,
and it seemed an interminable job. He
and a devoted Indian assistant slept inside
mosquito-nets which they had packed with
particular varieties of mosquito. When
officialdom heard that Ross was dissect-
>g mosquitoes, it laughed. When he pes-
tered it with his findings and prognostica-
tions, it became bored. When lie began
questioning its wisdom, it became alarmed.
His belief that in the anopheles mosquito
the guilty party would be found gave it
an idea. It shifted him to a district where
the anopheles was non-existent or extremely
hard to find. It thus took him years to estab-
lish his claim. To-day nobody dreams of
building a city, erecting a dam or opening
up virgin country in the tropics for rubber
or tea without adopting the malaria-pre-
ventive measures which Ross forced on
sluggish Governments against their will.
It .is perhaps significant that, besides his
scientific works, Ross published a novel, and
wrote poetry and several philosophic works.
The novel was not very good, and the
poetry was not of the best, but they re-
vealed the artist mind. It is a peculiarity
of the artist mind that it is always sceptical,
always analysing, always searching for the
reality behind the established body of
belief. The non-artistic mind is. satisfied
with Things as They Are. When it re-
ceives with great reluctance a new truth it
promptly proceeds to turn it into a dogma
and erect an institution around it, and to
fight for the institution against the sub-
versive attack of a fresh truth. Only the
artist mind seems capable of that leap in
the dark which must be made even when
the deductive process is the method in-
volved. Ross’s discovery is likely to follow
the usual course. It has become a dogma
in its turn. In Singapore, as a close
example, every valley in the municipal area
now has anti-malarial drains, hundreds oi
miles of them, and the spraying of pools
with oil is part of the established health
routine. In his latest report the municipal
engineer mentions the disquieting fact that
the anopheles mosquito appears to be adapt-
ing itself to changed conditions and is find-
ing new methods of breeding hitherto alien
to its ways. So a new Ross will have to
arise whose thankless job it will be to
force the old Ross institution to adapt itself,
(00.
Meantime we shall remember Sir Ronald
Ross as the man who enlarged the habit-
able globe by one-third.

Exchange and Retail Prices.
The papers are sprinkled with letters com-
plaining of the continued high cost of one
thing and another, and the Statist’s figures
show that to the end of July N. S. Wales
prices of non-rural commodities had shrunk
not at all for four months, and only three
points—from 181 to 178—since September
of last year. There is, of course, a reason
for it—probably more than one reason.
One, certainly, is the depreciation of the
Australian £. The exchange Australia on
London was put up to 130 in January of
last year. Since then Australia has exported
approximately 133 millions’ worth, on which
we have had to provide, say, 40 millions
of exchange: the rate was 130 until Decem-
ber and has been 125 since. Australia pays
this premium when it buys money in
London to pay either interest or for imports.
True, the whole 40 millions have not yet
been passed on to the Australian buyer.
Rut exchange does not add to the cost of
foreign goods only: the Australian buyer
of wool, for example, has to compete with
the foreign buyer, and give the seller the
benefit of the exchange, though the goods
never leave the countiy. It may, therefore,
be said confidently that much more than
40 millions hajs had to be added to the pur-
chase price of goods in Australia during the
past 20 months by reason of the exchange.
Admittedly the exporter could
done without it. But, as the figures show,
he is now losing some of the benefit of it,
and will lose more as the effect of the
charge is felt by retail prices. That always
happens where there is inflation of any
kind: hence, when inflation once starts, the
incessant cry for more and more of it.
4
Wool.
Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide have now
had wool sales of the 1932-33 clip, and it
is possible to say that the average prices
are from 25 to slightly more than 30 p.c.
better than those of June—the last sales
of the previous season—when abysmal
depths were readied. Over .the entire first
Sydney sales the average has been about
9.1 d., as against S.sBd. for the previous
season’s clip and 8.7 d. for the season 1930-
31. Compared with the figui-es of the
boom years the price is still low: from
1916 to 1920. under the appraisement
scheme, an average of 16.4 d. was realised,
and from 1920-28—the years of the post-
war boom —18.8 d. But 9.1 d. compares very
favorably with pre-war records; even for
the period 1906-15 the average was only
9.7 d.. and for 20 years before that a bare
7Jd. Further, it has to be remembered that
the 9.1 d. is paid in our depreciated cur-
rency. The question is whether we are justi-
fied in expecting a return to the prices of
the war-time and the post-war boom. Will
the world give—can the world give—more
for eur products than it did before it
pauperised itself by four years of colossal
waste? That really is the problem ahead of
the international economic conference. If
it can find a way by which prices may be
raised, the burden of debt, both direct and
indirect, upon industry will be lifted. If
it cannot find a way. we shall have to
make our arrangements accordingly ; and
among those arrangements will be a tre-
mendous readjustment of capital values and
debts.
Anyhow, in spite of the hysterics which
are heard both in Parliament and out of it.
we have this consolation : our, great pastoral
industry is not like a mine that *is worked
out. Ondhe contrary, pasture improvement,
and management are adding largely to the
carrying capacity of much of our pastoral
country, and, more important still, the
weight of fleece has been almost unbeliev-
ably increased. Down almost to the
’eighties our average clip was no more than
41b. per sheep; in the early ’nineties it
only occasionally climbed as high as 61b.
Last season the average .was 8.91 b.

The Domination of Exams.
Intelligence Tests, now in general use for
classification purposes in the schools of the
Oommomvealth, seem likely to play a useful
part in the search for a workable substitute
for the annual exams, for entry to high
schools. The Speck’s Education Department,
urged thereto by a conference of the
Teachers’ Union, is to make preliminary ex-
periments at the forthcoming qualifjdng
exams, with a view to ascertaining how the
new theory might be expected to work out
in practice. The contention of the teachers
is that pupils showing high proficiency in
English and arithmetic and able to measure
up satisfactorily in an adequate intelli-
gence test would probably be better worth
sending on to a secondary school than
many of those who, by cramming in halt
a dozen subjects of inferior importance,
manage to obtain the requisite number of
marks to pass for the High School. De-
tails of the methods by which this conten-
tion may be tested are not yet arranged,
but presumably the examiners, after com-
pleting the official examination in the ordi-
nary way (there can be no change this
year), will re-examine all the papers
(whether passes or failures) showing high
marks in English and arithmetic, and then
subject the candidates who did them to the
prescribed intelligence tests. If in these
tests the youngsters who have secured
passes in the requisite number of subjects
to qualify for the High School show no
mental superiority over those who failed
in subjects other than English and arith-
metic, it will be fair to conclude that the
present system of examination amounts to
little more than a test of a pupil’s capacity
to temporarily memorise, and is certainly
not a good test of his capacity to benefit
by secondary education. Whether the pro-
posed application of psychological tests
will point the way to a more rational
method remains to be seen. At any rate,
it is becoming increasingly plain that a
system of public instruction which makes
the passing of examinations the dominant
feature, the mark on which every effort
of teachers and pupils is concentrated
throughout the whole school year, cannot
possibly have anything but an ill effect
upon everybody concerned. Where school
life becomes a sort of mental treadmill
there can be little joy of teaching or joy
of learning.
♦
Cremation.
Those who advocate cremation as the only
sanitary method of disposing of the dead,
and who are engaged in providing facilities
for its practice, must find much encourage-
ment and satisfaction in the figures for
N. S. Wales. In less than 10 years the
number of cremations at Rookwood has in-
creased from under two a week to more
than 100 per month; and a second crema-
torium, to serve the northern suburbs, is
to be put in hand at once.
With those whose religious beliefs stand
in the way, neither the Cremation Society,
which is the propagandist body, nor the
Cremation Co., which provides the facili-
ties, makes any argument; but both bodies
appeal to those who have no such scruples
to consider whether it is not better for the
living that the body shall be consumed by
fire, leaving nothing but a handful of clean
ashes, than that it shall rot in corruption a
few feet under the soil in the midst of a
million breathing people.
Yet when it is remembered that for every
12 interments in Sydney there is still but
one cremation it will be seen how very far
there is to go on this road to reform. The
unknown is always the terrible, and
those who do not know what cremation i>
picture the weeping relations forced to
watch the coffin thrust into a raging fur-
nace, instead of lowered decorously into the
gaping earth. Actually there is no raging
furnace: instead of being held around an
open grave, the weather threatening dis-
aster to the health of mourners, the funeral
service takes place in a chapel, with the
coffin resting on a platform : the service over,
curtains part, the platform moves back, the
curtains fall-to again, and the mourners no
more see the raging furnace, if there is one,
than they are called upon to watch the slow
process of corruption when the body is
lowered into a grave.
And there is also, among many, the dread
of expense. In point of fact there is eco-
nomy in the sanitary method of reducing
the mortal remains to ashes. There is no
grave-digging; there is no after-expense ot
grave-maintenance. Last year 966 crema-
tions took place at Rookwood: the fees
collected for all seivices amounted to only
about £7 per cremation, and less than one-
third of that covered the actual working

certainly will come when cremation will be

less expensive than earth-burial.

POINTS
A lot of hard thinking is being done on
Australian slieep-runs at the moment. Wool
Jf selling in Australia at an average of
dd. (Australian), which means 7.2 d. in
Lnglish money. Yet Australian clips have
been selling at the London sales, which
opened a week ago, at lid., 12d. and 13d.
they don t send poor stuff to London these
days, it is true; but many a woolgrowcr
to whom the 30 or 25 p.e. exchange pre-
mium looked like money from home is be-
ginning to wonder whether he hasn’t had his
leg pulled most unmercifully. For 12d. in
Lnglish money is or ought to be 15d. in
Australian.
MRS. STATE LABOR (introducing Willis to
Lang) : “Your successor, John Thomas;
and I hope you mill be happier with the
Federal lady than you have made me.”
The new Australian Consols (4 p.c.)
climbed still a little higher last week, and
the whole 10 of them reached somewhere
between 99 and par. Things have changed
since Lang's maddest: moments. In London
just 12 months ago £8 18s. 6d. was judged
to be a fair return on N. S. Wales stocks.
To-day the figure is about £5 2s. 6d. Com-
mon wealth 5 per cents. (1945-75) are worth
£lO3, which suggests that a conversion or
renewal at better than 4| p.c. is possible,
though not certain. As for prices at home,
in July last year our Consols were valued
at a price to bring in £8 Os. Bd.; to-day,
as shown above, we have got back confidence
in ourselves so far that a shade over 4 p.c.
is reckoned a fair thing.
Not five months ago the Lang crowd was
reviling and defaulting in payment of in-
terest to the British creditors of N. 8.
Wales, and lawlessly resisting the national
Government’s efforts to hold it to its obli-
gations—not only to “bloodsucking bond-
holders’’ but also to the Commonwealth and
its bank —and promising De Valera support
for Ms form of default. All this with a
£13,000.000 loan falling due at London in
November, and nothing done to meet it. Now
Burke, wlm was Lang’s Speaker, proposes
that the “bloodsucking bondholders” should
convert at a low rate of interest and lend
his .State another £20.000,000. Have these
mob-politicians no pride or arc they all hide?
A nice dry bit the Commonwealth Bank
drops into the Treasury these days. The
profit on the note issue for the half year to
June 30 was £1,022,436, three-fourths of
which the hungry Treasurer gets, the other
fourth being added to the capital of the Rural
Credits Department. Until the crisis hit
Australia half the profit from the note issue
used to go to the national sinking fund;
but that excellent arrangement had to go
overboard. The general banking profit for
the six mouths was £231,524: half of that
goes to the national sinking fund, half to
reserves. Half the profit (£34,576) of the
Rural Credits Department goes to that de-
partment’s reserves; the rest to what is
called its development fund. The Savings
Bank accounts are kept separate. It made
a profit of £119,222 ; and that is a total of
£1,407,758 for the four. All out of nothing,
because the Bank started without any capi-
tal whatever —another example of what con-
fidence ("whose other name is credit) can do.
The Commonwealth Government has lost
the services of Hawker, who was making good
as Minister of Commerce, in circumstances
highly creditable to him. During the elec-
tion campaign Hawker pledged himself to
support a reduction . of Parliamentary
salaries to £6OO p.a., the 1907-20 figure. So
when that queer stick Joel Moses Gabb moved
that the reduction should be made, Hawker
manfully voted for it, first writing out his
resignation as Minister. This Lyons accepted
with compliments and regrets; a wiser Pri-
minister would have replied that the Gov-
ernment thought too highly of Hawker to
let him make a martyr of himself. There is
a disposition to heave rocks at Gabb for
placing his fellow-Soustralian in such a posi-
tion, but in his uncompromising Puritan
way Gabb showed himself a man of prin-
ciple, too. He is worth half a dozen of the
poor specimens of N.S.W. politicians who,
when Stevens put it to his party that
Assembly salaries, now £705 p.a., should
revert to £6OO, refused to sacrifice more than
“the basic-wage cut of 12s. 6d. a week”—the
one conspicuous blot on an able Budget.
The Vic. law relating to the possession of
firearms is being tightened up. Bank officials
and others who have the custody of portable
property will still get permits, but it is
intended to revise the list; also, any weapon
the barrel of which is 16in. long and has
an overall length of Sin. is. to be deemed a
pistol, even if it is a sawn-off gun. Penal-
ties are strong—so strong that Prendergast
drily suggested adding transportation. Men-
zies replied that he .was willing if it could
be done.
Premier Mitchell, of Westralia, has given
notice that he can’t stand it any longer. His
State has been the deceived and downtrodden
victim of Protectionist harpies in the effete
East, and he insists. on seceding. Still,
Jimmy’s State voted itself into the Com-
monwealth, and if it thinks of voting itself
out the Commonwealth should have a say in
the referendum. For one thing, he might
want to count into the secession movement
some part: of the big State which doesn’t
want to secede.
The vile career of Bennett, who received
a life sentence for rape in Westralia and
a death sentence for the same crime in Vic-
toria^ —the victim in each case was a child—
and 15 years for robbery under arms in
between, has ended on the gallows at Pent-
ridge. A Labor Attorney-General who be-
lieved that criminals, however ferocious, can
be cured by kindness had the life sentence
cancelled after three years; and the price
of his folly was paid by, among others, a
working-man's daughter, four years old. It
was the first hanging of the century for any-
thing but: murder, and, strangely enough,
little fuss was made by the sentimentalists
who habitually try to save murderers from
the rope. They must have thought it use-
less to strive against the general conviction
that two-legged animals who outrage babies
are better dead.
Queensland Labor is taking the cut of
id. a pound in the retail price of sugar—
it is to be made from the first of January-
very sourly. One effect, it protests, is that
Queensland will be force'd to reduce its con-
siderable purchases from the States which
have compelled the reduction. More obvious
results are that the area under cane will
have to be restricted and cutters will be
obliged to take less for their exertions.
Neither operation will tend to increase the
Forgan Smiths’ popularity, though—much
against their will—they will bo concerned
m both.
“Dr. Argyle, Premier and Treasurer of Victoria,
expects to pull through this year with a deficit of
£850,000.”
DR. ARGYLE: “And, mind, you’re down to
two tastes a day. And next year you’ll
have to cut it right out.”
In his report for 1930-31 the N.S.W.
Auditor-General pointed out that three
Ministers had had the spending of four mil-
lions of unemployed-relief money “untram-
melled, except by very general directions in
the statute.” He repeats the comment this
year, with the addition that the amount has
grown to “over ten million pounds.” Among
the items questioned is “a grant of £750, paid
to J. J. Graves for disbursement to destitute
women in the metropolitan area.” From a
return supplied by J. J. Graves, “cash pay-
ments ranging from 7s. 6d. to fl were made
to 1003 women,” but “the lists of names and
amounts” are such that “no verification
is practicable.” The only “verification
practicable” relates to the identity of Graves
himself. He is secretary of Lang’s party.
The inter-State congress of Trades Hall
bosses held in Melbourne decided in favor
of “the socialisation of the means of life”
and the abolition of the wages system. The
old socialist plank, which talked about “the
means of production, distribution and ex-
change” has been jettisoned. The new one
“Trade-union delegates to the number of 120
gathered in Melbourne and talked for five days with-
out arriving at. any practicable decision."
"An’, o’ course, if you gasbags can’t gel ’em
for us, you’re willin’ to take ’em for
yourselves.”
is a better one from the propagandist point
of view; it. isn’t, quite so obvious that the
farmer is to lose his farm, and the chimney-
sweep even his brooms. As for the abolition
of the wages system, Comrade Lenin tried
that. But disillusionment killed Comrade
Lenin, and Comrade Stalin had to restore the
system of rewards according to services—
which, after all, is all that the wages system
means.
In Moore’s time, the Queensland taxes,
State and Federal, on income from personal
exertion amounted to £47 7s. lid. on £583,
£132 Bs. 4d. on £lOOO, £3BB 18s. 4d. on
£2OOO and £769 10s. on £3OOO. On property
income the rates were so much higher (as,
indeed, they are in every State but West-
ralia, which stoutly refuses to penalise
old people for having been thrifty) that the
tax-gatherers grabbed £ll3 9s. Id. from £583,
£2BO 7s. 6d. from £lOOO. £715 from £2OOO
and £l2BB ss. from £3OOO. These calcula-
tions were based on an unemployed-relief tax
of oid. in the £—3d. for three month's of the
financial year and 6d. for nine months.
Now persons with £5OO and upwards will
have to pay a good deal more, for since the
end of July, thanks to the good, kind
“Labor” Government, their relief tax has
been raised to Is. in the £. At the same
time there has been a sharp rise in the
number of single men receiving rations. It
is an experience with which N. S. Wales is
painfully familiar.
James, one of the Lang faction in the
House of Reps, has had the gall to taunt
Bruce (in his absence, of course) with having
fought as a British soldier. “It was beneath
his dignity to enlist in the Australian army,”
the Langster sneered. “To what regiment
did you belong?” asked McNicoll, who led
the 6th Battalion on Gallipoli and the 10th
Brigade in France. “I ‘fought’ in the indus-
trial army on behalf of the workers,” was
the fellow’s reply. Yes, and came out with
a whole skin, whereas Bruce was badly
knocked. As a matter of fact, Bruce, being
in England when war broke out, could not
have joined the A.1.F.; this was forbidden
by the Fisher Government. Like every Aus-
tralian of spirit in the same situation, lie
straightway joined Kitchener's army. Had
he returned home and become a non-starter
and hurled Ijimself into the 1917 strike, he
would be a hero to James and Ward.
Next to the familiar demands for the
earth, together with the sun, moon and stars,
the most frequent remark heard at the
Trade-Union Congress in Melbourne was
“You’re a liar.” An adjective was inter-
polated now and then, as when Comrade
Tappertip said that “the organised thugs of
Communism tried to throw members of our
movement into the Yarra,” and Comrade
Snappertip boiled over. Still, the congress
had one lucid interval; it resolved that the
Constitution should be amended “to enable
the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate
on all industrial matters, including workers’
compensation and national health insurance.”
Stevens would support that, though it is
doubtful if Lang would.
In its arrangements with Britain the
Free State contracted to pay Royal Irish
Constabulary and civil pensions, and sink-
ing-fund charges in respect of local-govern-
ment loans guaranteed by the Oppressor, in
consideration of being relieved of responsi-
bility for Great War debt. All this money,
as well as the land-purchase annuities, is
being “retained” by the Do Valera Govern-
ment. If De Valera can hold out till
November he will have “retained” £2,311,000,
of which £466,000 will represent IMA.
pensions—of course, the British Govern-
ment is seeing that the old men, widows
and orphans do not want. Meanwhile there
is an almighty slump in subscriptions to the
Irish sweeps. They mostly come from the
Oppressor’s country, and tlic “retaining” of
the land-purchase money and the poor old
peelers’ pensions has bred the fear—ground-
less, no doubt, but natural —that prizes
might, be “retained,” too.
Theodore introduced the practice of float-
ing loans in New York. Lang followed him
eagerly, and Earle Page joined in. Some
of the ghastly results are mentioned by
Auditor-General Spence in his latest report.
On June 30, N. S. Wales owed New York
£13,608,100, on which annual interest was
nominally £660,940, the average rate being
£4 17s. Id. p.c. But the interest -was pay-
able in New York, and the exchange rate
went as high as 77 p.c. Exchange had also
to be added to remittances for the repur-
chase of securities with a face value of
£217,400. These were bought at 64.4 dollars
in the 100, that being New York’s opinion
of Lang; but, exchange brought the price
above face value. Above all, the money for
the operation was borrowed at 4 p.c.; and the
State will have to go on paying this 4 p.c.,
as well as 4i p.c. “to the National Debt
Commission on the extinguished debt.”
Stevens is substituting a 1 p.c. turnover
tax on bookmakers for Lang's 10 p.c. on
punters to whom they pay out, at the same
time reducing the betting-ticket tax from
3d. to Id. in the paddock and from Id. to
id, in other parts. As a precaution against
falsification of betting-sheets it is proposed
to collect duplicates "after every race.” This
will necessitate increasing the multitude of
tax-gatherers, and there will still be no safe-
guard against dishonorable understandings
with backers who book their bets. Accord-
ing to Minister Dunningham, himself a ring-
man, some of the big Sydney bookmakers have
declared their returns at less than those of
the small fry on the flat. These gentry will
continue to operate (though the Government
should either prosecute them or cause them
to be delicensed), and the will to cheat will
remain. For once The Bulletin agrees
with Lang: it would be better to restrict
betting to the tote, which welshes neither
the punter nor the country.
Near relatives of unemployed drawing
“sustenance” from the Vic. Government ai"
to be tapped for contributions, if Parliament
gives Minister Kent Hughes the necessary
authority. No doubt those who can show
they have promised Lyons to give what they
can to parents who have been drawing the
old-age pension will be let alone. People

and other old-fashioned virtues will not be

questioned at all. There are many of these,
and it would be a black outlook for Aus-
tralia if there were not; but they get no
admiration or consideration or anything but
threats of still more savage taxes from the
mob-politician. He regards them as mugs.


SOCIETY

‘'Cruiser”: A matron from the pleasant
rural shire of Heidelberg (Vie.) gained an
insight into theatrical habits and customs
recently. She was invited to call on two

married members of a busking co. at their
apartments in a fashionable boarding-house.
SJie knocked at. the door, a voice begged her
to come in, she stepped inside —and was
greeted by her host, clad chastely but
simply in a shirt. With old-world courtesy
he shook her hand, wafted her to a sear,
shouted, for his wife and then resumed his
interrupted dressing. The visitor was begin-
ning to adjust herself nicely to the existing
situation when the door of the private bath-
room flew open and the actor’s better-half
burst in without a stitch on. She, too, greeted
the guest with complete aplomb and then
proceeded to root around for some clothes.
The matron bore up well, considering she
came from Heidelberg.
•‘Dr. Nil” : The other day, after an absence
of four years, I revisited Port Broughton,
on the Spencer Gulf (S. Aus.). I didn’t
notice any very great increase in its size;
tlie number of (logs, old Fords and narrow-
gauge wheat-trucks in the main street
seemed about up to normal standard. But
one morning, as I took a stroll along tlie
Esplanade, I found a new signboard at the
corner of the principal thoroughfare (which
is about two chains wide). It read, ‘-‘One-
way Traffic!”
* * * *
“Kuna”: Another gentle request that
reaped an unexpected harvest. The head
of a big girls’ college sorrowfully advised
the upper classes that it had come to her
knowledge that a copy of a banned book
was being circulated in the school. She
would refrain from asking who was the
owner, but she did ask that the copy be
dropped that evening on the table of her
study, which would be left vacant and with
an open door. It was a slightly-staggered
mistress who later on regarded her haul;
there were five copies of the book in ques-
tion, two more of another hectic publication,
plus a couple of plays of doubtful character.
“K.N.M.” : To sprinkle petrol over a man
in a drunken sleep and deliberately set alight
to him would seem the last word in
fiendish cruelty, especially on the part of a
woman. Yet apparently it was simply
because she was a woman that Rita Bransby,
who faced a jury on the capital charge at
Perth the other day, escaped the logical con-
sequences of her diabolical act. There was
little defence worth speaking of beyond a
half-hearted attempt to suggest that the
poor wretch, who died a day or two later
with his lips sealed, might have come by Irs
injuries in attempting to light a fire and
using petrol in mistake for kerosene. That
plea having failed, there was no possibility
of doubt as to whose hand did the deed, but
the jury found some extenuation in the
fact (1) that the hideous crime was com-
mitted after a bitter quarrel, and (2) that
the perpetrator showed j-eal regret for her
act—afterwards. Anyhow they made it
"manslaughter with a strong recommendation
to mercy.” The Judge made .it four years.
“Splinter”: I give the bun for quick
thinking to a long-deceased Australian poli-
tician who was talking against time. • He
had been pulled up by the Speaker several
times for irrelevance, and had almost run
out of material, when a brainwave
struck him. He called for and obtained a
particularly large electoral roll, and. claimed
the right to read to the House the people
for whom he was speaking. And for an-
other half-hour he droned away: “Abraham,
Elisa May, 24 Anyroad, Somewhere” —and
so on and on. Beat that!

“10-2-4”: My friends the Bingledoms have
no money, no position and, so far as I
know, no religion. Yet they are 'a most
punctilious lot; loyal to Throne and Empire,
courteous in an environment which has little
time for the refinements of life, and con-
temptuous in a mild, well-bred way of any
kind of excess. I learned the explanation
when I invited old Bingledom into a pub.
I-Ie shook his head amiably: “Members of
my family don’t frequent—er —pubs.” It
appeared that the Bingledoms were de-
scended from the Earls of. Teviot. It im-
posed certain standards. When young Harry
Bingledom found himself getting muzzy at
a party, as a result of three quick beers, he
recalled his origin and went home; when
a member of the trading classes tried to put
the hard word on Elsie Bingledom she
landed him a clout on the ear that nearly
stunned him—the sort of unmistakable re-
buff a mediaeval Countess of Teviot might
have given an insolent lackey. Their con-
duct was almost entirely governed by re-
ference to what the Earls of Teviot would
have done in similar circumstances. One
day it occurred to me to look them up .in
Debrett. It turned out that “Earl of
Teviot” was. one of the many titles of the
Duke of Smithson. The dukedom, earldom
and half a dozen more had sprung into
existence together in the reign of an in-
fatuated monarch. The Teviots were Smith-
sons, so to speak, and there was no record
of a Bingledom among them. Thousands
in this remote land, where few have
reference-books, are faithfully worshipping
invented gods like the Earls of Teviot, and
deriving an immense amount of spiritual good
from it.

promptly lost consciousness from shock.
When she came round she found herself on
a couch, while on a stool near by stood a
bottle of brandy, a jug of water and a glass.
As she was ’ extremely damp about the head
she came to the conclusion that Mr. Sikes,
before departing with most of the household
jewellery, had made an effort to revive her;
failing in that he had left the, necessary
items handy for her to do the best she could
for herself.
“Bloggs”: No one lias been able to say
what a gentleman is—to segregate the type,
so to speak, within the four corners of a
definition- —but you can often know one by
his works. Meet my
humble friend Bol-
ger, who curses
w li e n annoyed,
drinks hard when
so disposed, dresses
abominably, has an
Australian accent
and drives a dirty
old car. He was
giving me a lift the
other evening and
stopped to buy a
paper. But the
paper-seller was
blind. Bolger was
about to drive on
when a passing-
worker spotted the
position, held out
,his hand for the
'money and came
back with the
paper. “M uc h
obliged,” said Bol-
ger. “Thank you
very much. I didn’t
know he was blind.”
“Yes, lie’s blind,”
said the worker,
and went on. “Why
the silly remark
about not knowing
he was blind?”
I asked. “To make the cove who got the
paper feel comfortable,” said Bolger. “It
showed I knew he had done the job for a
blind man, and not for two able-bodied
strangers.” Define in a few words those
who behave like that as a matter of instinct,
and you will have done something that has
baffled all the lexicographers.
“Mortiboy”: A will case which necessi-
tated a lot of digging into mouldy docu-
ments has been occupying the South Aus.
Supreme Court. One John Kennedy was
convicted at the Old Bailey .in 1824 of
having ‘ embezzled £5O, the moneys of his
employer, James Hathaway. The Judge
gave him 14 years, and, in due course, he
arrived in Van Diemen’s Land. He got his
ticket of leave in a few years and presently
cast up in Adelaide, where he found employ-
ment as a prison turnkey. The records
show that lie was sacked for misappropriating
prisoners’ rations, but before that he 1 had
purchased a farm and certain lands, and
when he died in 1870 his estate was valued
at over £lOOO. He left it to his daughter
for life; and when she died, unmarried, five
years ago, its value had increased tenfold.
In the event of the daughter dying without
issue the testator had willed half his estate
to Mary Hathaway, of London, wife of the
man he had been transported for robbing,
and the other half to an English relative
of liis own name. The latter proved un-
traceable, but eight claimants turned up on
the strength of the Hathaway connection,
all great-grandchildren or thereabouts of tlie
original legatee, and ; Sonah found that dive
of them were entitled to the ex-convict s
possessions in equal shares. So the money
that was embezzled from Mary's husband
goes back to his and her descendants after
a century with generous interest, the £5O
having become £lO,OOO.
“Brassbound”: The seafarer is one of the
most conservative of human beings. Ever
since the first man navigated a river on a
log, which he steered with a stick, the sailor
has navigated his craft on the same prin-
ciple—by pulling liis end of the stick to the
left when he wanted the log to go to. the
right and vice versa. The same observance
attended the steering oar and the tiller, and
when the wheel was evolved was transferred
to that. Even when the direct pull of the
tiller ropes was eliminated by the simple
device of crossing the ropes, and later by the
introduction of steam and electrical steer-
ing machinery, the methods of the man on
the log were adhered to. In spite of the
fact that to turn a modern ship to port the
wheel is spun to port, the order remains to
“starboard the helm,” or “port the helm” if
the contrary direction is desired. There is to
be an end to all that. From January 1 the
British navy and mercantile marine will use
instead the order to wheel to port or star-
board, as the case may be. After six months,
the reference to the wheel will be cut out
and the words “to port” or “to starboard”
used only.
“Jindiwick” : Touching upon these periodi-
cal rumors about the finding of traces of
the lost air-liner Southern Cloud (B.
31/S/’32), the search has really never ceased
in one part of Gippsland. A Melbourne
journalist has worked assiduously on the
mystery, and the evidence collected furnishes
the strongest presumption that the ’plane
crashed in the dense scrub some miles to the
south-east of Noojec. There are several resi-
dents who are positive they saw the
machine flying over the bush in a north-
westerly direction about 6 p.m. on the after-
noon on which it disappeared, and the story
is so well substantiated that searchers are
still combing the bush in this area.
“Whitehall ”: Earl Russell, who has just
published a book urging that undergrads,

riages and that children should be encour-
aged to swear, call their parents fools and

matician and eminent limelighter under the,

lish bourjoos mild shocks of the kind fdr a

ing gravely to consider some abstruse aspect

tabernacle. He got .some enjoyable pub-
licity three months ago by writing to ihc

as “Mr.” Russell on the ground that the
use of his title was “snobbery.” The “New
Statesman” remarked shrewdly

not necessarily superior; and for “Mr.” Russell
to assume that other people assume that peerity is
superior, and hence to deprecate the use of his
title, is an extreme form of snobbery.
He welcomes such rebukes as warmly as
G. B. Shaw. The chief difference between the
two old gentlemen, regarded as publicity-
hounds, is that the earl footles a good deal
and Shaw doesn’t.
A BASIC-WAGE TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Speaking on the Bookmakers’ Taxation Act, Mr.
Lang said that the falling-off in racecourse attend-
ance was widespread and with a basic wage of
£3 10s. it was not likely to improve.”
You deemed his lines were cast in pleasant
places,
That earth would aye for him her fullness
yield,
The gent, who dons his satchel at the races
And blithely bellows “Five to four the
held.”
You watched the stream of punters toward

And many a time conjectured, I’ll engage,
That here was one wlio'd never need to
worry
About the basic wage.
Yet. you were wrong. In this, financial
weather,
Whose chill severity no man disputes.
Bethink that shoes, even of patent leather,
May pinch as parlously as blucher boots.
All ranks alike it leavens —and it leadens.

Go backing either red-hot certs or dead bins
On three-pound-ten a week?
You featured an expensive Packard.drew him
Homeward o’ nights to count his bulging
wads;
Sleek and bediamonded your artists drew
him,
The lavish layer of exiguous odds,
One who was wont to celebrate the
“skinners”
And “punches” incidental to his biz
By singularly choice and ample dinners,
Washed down with creaming fizz. '
You thought in satin sheen and silken glory
His feminine belongings daily went,
Or decked in richest furs —-a busted story.
An. envious canard that’s a pieces rent.
He may have once in limousines have ridden
With her in fashion’s latest, we’ll allow.
But. what between the basic wage and
Whiddon,
He’s up against it now.
All, well, one proverb—and there’s, some-
thing in it —
One saw that sages make and fools, repeat.
Asseverates a mug is born a minute ;
Another has it little fish arc sweet,
But neither high nor low. nor saints nor
sinners,
In times like these may dodge misfor-

What if the ringmen long were money-
spinners,
How can a fellow go on picking winners
On three-pound-ten a week?,

"Nakhoda”: In the Swiss mountains I
frequently came across people wlio gave
circumstantial accounts of how infants'had
been picked out of cradles by eagles and
taken to nests high in the crags. I took
them with a grain of salt, but Castlemaine
( A ic.) has just provided confirmation of a
sort. A resident was taking a walk when
a wedge-tailed eagle made two attempts to
make off with his pup. Certainly it only
rose with its burden two feet into the air,
but perhaps babies are smaller and eagles
bigger in Switzerland.

“Strict Veg”: Sunday train-travellers in
Melbourne recently had their attention
arrested by the spectacle of a woman hurry-
ing along a suburban station piloting a small
boy with a common bedroom utensil firmly
jammed on his head. She blushingly explained
to her fellow-passengers that it had got in
that position in the course of a childish
game. Being of white enamel it defied
domestic attempts at removal and the child
was subsequently separated from his head-
gear under an anaesthetic at the Melbourne
Hospital. A similar operation had to be
performed on a boy at the same institution
a few years ago. In that case the mother
was responsiblo. She was following a
popular recipe for cutting the infant’s liair.

“Pawang”: The conquest of leprosy is
the latest tribute to the value of international
co-operation. The other day the gates of the
Sungei Buloh asylum in Malaya—the largest
of its kind in the British Empire and har-
boring 1000 patients—opened and 60 shy
mortals emerged. Some had been incar-
cerated for upwards of 20 years and one
had been an inmate so long that he gave his
occupation before entering as “schoolboy.”
When they reached the nearest town several
of them made a beeline for a theatre and
heard a talkie for the first time. Up to a
couple of years ago, when the gates of a
leper asylum closed on a victim of the fell
disease they closed for life. Modern methods
of treatment, which include building up the
constitution with good food and normal acti-
vities, coupled with specific remedies, have
led leperologists to the conclusion that when
a patient lias shown a negative reaction for
two years he can be considered as cured.

“C.Q.”: The earnings of old-established
members of the begging profession have seri-
ously declined in Melbourne. A blind
man who was a prominent object in a
favored site near the Spencer-street station
DON’T STOP THEM.
“Our ancestors would turn over in their graves, Ma,
if they could see us now.”
"Well, they might be more comfortable if they did.”
for many years died recently and left £6OOO,
but most of his fortune was acquired before
the present slump, which has introduced
new methods into the calling. Mere street
begging has come t 0 be regarded as the
resort of the mentally indigent. Mendicants
of normal ingenuity and address despise if.
The latest dodge is to buy a sailor’s peaked
cap, obtain a document which bears some
resemblance to a Customs manifest and seek
entrance to the office of a busiuess man, one
famed for his astuteness and commercial
cunning being preferred. A couple of suit
lengths complete the equipment. These are
exhibited, and the tale is pitched that, as
the business man can see with his own eyes,
they are English cloth and therefore im-
measurably superior to the Australian article.
A faint suggestion that they have been
smuggled into the country is allowed to
hover in the air without crystallising into
an absolute statement 0 f fact. The price is
ridiculously cheap for imported tweeds, and
the bargain is clinched. When the purchaser
takes the stuff along to his tailor it is imme-
diately recognised as having been bought in
Flinders-lane.
“Strict Veg.”: The announcement of the
formation of a Melbourne University Yo-
THE GRADUATE.
I: “Yes, she’s only nineteen and got her degree!”
II: “She must be clever! Got her degree, you say?”
III: “Yes. The Judge made it absolute last month.”
Yo Club, witli Professor Scott as its presi-
dent and P. D. Phillips, of the League of
Nations Union, as its secretary, was taken
to mean that the city’s leading educational
association had suddenly become indecently
skittish in its old age. An announcement
from Mr. Phillips has put the matter in a
different perspective :—-
In a community in which knowledge, intellec-
tual activity and scientific progress are cribbed,
cabined and confined by a book tariff superimposed
upon a depreciated currency, and aided by a tower-
ing primage duty, some path t 0 relief must, be
discovered. The normal forms of recreation suffer
the heavy hand of Cabinet regulation, so that we
are not permitted to combine interest with amuse-
ment and observe a Russian view of the fruits of
the Five-year Plan lest we be contaminated by
propaganda so insidious that normal-minded adults
cannot resist it. What is there left for those who would
wish to play a small part in our intellectual develop-
ment? The answer, I venture to suggest, is the
propagation of a pastime which requires no intelli-
gence, contains no subversive tendencies, and, above
all-—oli, admirable combination of playfulness and
patriotism! may even swell the Customs receipts.
It was a neat bit of satire if the several
hundred other members of the Yo-Yp Club
joined up in the same spirit of passionate
protest, but Yo-Yo is too like the annual
Uni. commemoration to resolve all doubts.

“Lapsus”: According to medical evidence
given at a Ryde (N.S.W.) coroner’s
inquest an old man swallowed his tongue
during a heart attack and died from suffo-
cation. Such a fatality is probably' very
rare, but there is an Oriental tradition, well-
founded or otherwise, that
something on the same lines
is a necessary precedent to
the Indian fakir’s habit of
putting himself into a pro-
longed sleep, or trance, or
state of suspended animation
designed to last for weeks or
months. There is a. refer-
ence to it in Stevenson’s
"Master of Ballantrae”—“l
teach you to swallow your
tongue,” says : the Indian ser-
vant.. I find if puzzling. Can
anybody be taught how to
swallow his tongue without
fatal results—or even with
them?

“Carlos”: When countries
that have been monarchical
for centuries go republican,
they seldom stick at half-way
measures. A cable from Mad-
rid states that among a num-
ber of other unwanted persons
who have been peremptorily
deported to Africa were “two
dukes, twelve marquises and
eight counts.” Whether this
aggregation of nobility was
sent packing for having royal-
ist leanings, for being pos-
sessed of. estates that invite
confiscation, or merely for
being dukes and marquises, is
not altogether clear, but it is
probably only a foretaste of
what is to come when Spanish
republicanism gets well into
its stride. The distracted
country’s titled families date
back further than any in
Europe, with the exception of
Italian; most British duke-
doms are mere mushroom
growths in comparison with Spanish ones.
There is one ancient house whose head is
(or was) entitled to call himself Duke-Duke
on account of its possessing so many duchies
to its own Cheek, as it were.
* * * *
“Bluebottle”: London police are incensed
at a new order compelling them to wear
their chin-straps in regulation fashion in-
stead of tucked into the helmet. Their
chief objection is that in summer time the
strap leaves a white line round a tanned
face,. a phenomenon with which the troops
in Sinai and Palestine were familiar. As
many of the police work as plain-clothes
men, the line is an unmistakable intima-
tion to every crook within sight that the foe
is abroad. Sydney police have recently been
rigging themselves up as down-and-outs and
lounging about car-parking places on the
look out for car-stealers. I spotted an
apparent derelict in Bridge-street the other
day, leaning vacantly against a wall. He
was well built and his fiat back and un-
loafer-like carriage suggested an ex-Guards-
man. His clothes and boots were ghastly,
but closer inspection showed that his eye
was clear and bright and his firm, ruddy
cheeks were shaved immaculately. It was
then that I tumbled.
Chaser : Nothing very astonishing about
an Australian being found on a goldmine
m the desert near Kosseir (B. 21/9/’32).
This place is a port in Upper Egypt on the
Red Sea and the mountain country behind
has been mined for gold and turquoise since
the beginning of history. Gold was one of
the staple rake-offs that the Turkish and
Egyptian rulers . wrung from Upper Egypt
and Nubia, but the Mahdi rising put an end
to that. Since then more than one English
company has worked gold in Upper Egypt,
one being busy there at the outbreak of the
war. In the A.1.F., especially the Westra-
lian and Queensland regiments, were many
experienced prospectors, and more than one
must have stayed behind to try his luck.

the sensitive it may have its repulsive
aspects, but the same is true of -murder
itself. I am certainly in favor of separating
the cases of murder done in the heat of
passion from the deliberate destruction of
a fellow-being for gain or lust; the dis-
tinction is emphasied by the criminal codes
of Queensland and Westralia, which draw
a line between “murder” and “wilful
murder.” Many murderers, when finally con-
victed, have turned out to have been en-
thusiastic practitioners in this art foT years.
Deeming and Neil Cream, one a slayer of

“Inner Temple’*: A Victorian politician
told the Preston Methodist Church last
week that “the traditional English Sunday”
was “being sold by the Railway Commis-
sioners for a few tainted pieces of silver”
Here are some quotations from recent Lon-
don papers:—
“Londoners can bet as easily at the Pool Tote
Club Lwhich has extensive West End headquarters]
on Sundays, as well as week days, as they can buv
sugar from the grocers.”— “Mirror ”
“The English Sunday has become a Continental
Sunday; 200,000 shops—4o,ooo in London alone—
are open on the ‘day of rest’; 86,728 licensed me-
nuses are open .’’—‘‘Express/’
“500,000 Londoners go to the cinema every Sun-
day.”—'“Daily Mail.”
“Why not demand contributions to charity from
the railway companies who run [Sunday] trips to
Brighton and Blackpool and from the owners of
charabancs and dog-racing tracks?”
•—“New Statesman.”
When I was in England a few years ago
I found the roads round London almost
impassable with cars, bikes, ’buses, etc., on
fine Sundays; the restaurants packed with
diners and dancers at night; tennis courts
golf links, and so on uncomfortably crowded,
and cricket in progress on most of the
village greens. The English also patronise
on Sundays (to quote again from the “New
Statesman”) “musical entertainments, con-
certs and the like, museums, picture
galleries, zoos, botanical gardens and aquar-
iums.” I offer no opinion on the merits or
otherwise of Sabbatarianism, but I do submit
that our public men should drop talking as
if we were miserable sinners and the Eng-
lish saints. You can see more Sabbath-break-
ing in and around London on a fine Sunday
morning than you could in Melbourne in a year.
T _, “‘Si Arm : Strange problems confront
British Judges in Malayan courts. Recently
a Chinaman at Ipoh was charged with break-
ing and entering. The charge having been
proved, a still more serious indictment
was laid that he was a leper. The Judge
sentenced him to one day’s imprison-
ment for the first offence and removal to the
leper hospital for the second. Then the dock
was sprayed with strong disinfectant, the
Court vigorously fanned itself and turned to
the next case.

“Strict Yeg._”: A Lome (Vic.) lady is
anxiously waiting to hear from an analyst
as to whether a substance she picked up on
the beach is ambergris or not. If it is she
is the richer by £2OOO. A man who found
a lump of the real stuff at Coogee some
years ago was not as astute as the woman
of Lorne. Having an obsession for salvag-
mg almost anything he found on the
beach, he took the junk home and put
it in the woodshed. Later in the day
he broke a small piece off and, put-
ting it in his pocket, repaired to his
university, the local pub. The publi-
can took it, smelt it, and pronounced
on the authority of an expert that it
was ambergris. The owner dashed for
his home, dreaming of what he would do
with the £5OOO which on a conservative
estimate the whole block was worth. When
he got to the woodshed he found the treasure
trove gone and a sickly expression on the
face of his dog.

“Cauboy” : An interesting sidelight on our
National Bard is thrown by “Shakspeare
Through Indian Eyes,” written by a young
Hindu. According to this critic, the immor-
tal William is served up to the unfortunate
balm much as he is served up to Australian
kids. He is a compulsory subject and no
important exam, can be passed without an
academic knowledge of his works. The
Indian student has to wrestle with his inter-
minable puns, liis strange Elizabethan cir-
cumlocutions. his alien philosophy, his weird
grammar, his double superlatives and nega-
tives, his often bombastic and turgid national-
ism and the topical allusions with which
he tickled the. groundlings in Queen Bess’s
day, but which bore anybody courageous
enough to admit it to-day. The result is
the balm leaves school hating Shakspeare
with all his might. The real virtues of
Shakspeare lie as much in his music as in
his thought. The method of teaching him
in schools as effectively quenches the music
as does translation into q foreign tongue.
Frenchmen who only know Shakspeare in
translation regard him as a barbarian.

“D.D.”: When our vicar informed us
that there were thousands of people whose
only regret was that they had not sufficient
time for all the follies they wished to com-
mit, it set me wondering where I had pre-
viously struck that sentiment. At last I
traced it to a series of philosophies which
ran through The Bulletin some 40 years
ago. Victor Daley began with:—
Time lost than time misspent gives keener sting,
And joys foregone than joys that sorrow bring.
To which Steele Grey replied:
Victor, you’re right; my heart the more hath bled
And felt the keener sting (though long I’ve
hidden ’t),
Not for the times I’ve painted cities red,
But for the times that I might have and didn’t.
“Ibn el Issar”: A fool cable dealing with
the situation in India says that now “thou-
sands of untouchables and other low castes”
are being permitted to bathe at Benares in
the “sacred water of the Ganges, which,
for thousands of years, only the highest-
easte Hindus have been allowed to do.” To
begin with, the “untouchables” have no caste
at all. As to the bathing ghats at Benares,
an early-morning visit will show every
caste in India bathing there. It is the only
chance that the vast proportion of Benares’s
native inhabitants have of getting a decent
wash, though it is certainly not one for the
fastidious.

Ex-High Commissioner Eyrie hopes to re-

as M.L.A. for Queahbeyan (1906-09) and
16 as M.H.R. for North' Sydney and Warrm-
gah (1911-27). If he does manage it, he
will be the first ex-H.C. t 0 do so. Reid
stayed in England and was welcomed to the
House of Commons ; Andy Fisher returned to
Australia to find the cupboard bare; and
the High Commissionership closed Joe Cook’s
public career, though Cook was no older than
Ryrie (67) when his London term ended.
W. G. Duncan, M.L.C., president of the

who can always find time to do another little

They crop up everywhere, Australians, to
speak with authority on the most abstruse
subjects. At a recent pow-wow on that
Celtic puzzle Stonehenge, held by a number
of illustrious scientists on the spot, two of
the speakers were Professor Elliot Smith,
a native of Grafton (N.S.W.), and Professor
V. Gordon Childe, who was born in North
Sydney, where his father was rector, 40
years ago. Elliot Smith is the better-known,
but Childe, who left Sydney Uni. for Oxford
just before the war, has specialised _ m
anthropology and the dawnings of civilisation
to some purpose. He has been Professor of
Prehistoric Archaeology at Edinburgh Uni-
versity since 1927.
Harold Wylde, who succeeds John Demp-
ster (resigned) as city organist of Adelaide,
is a local product, but with English train-
ing—Lincoln Cathedral and Royal College
of Music under Parratt. Then he came home
for 10 years as organ-teacher at the Elder
Conservatorium, took another long Euro-
pean experience, with all sorts of degrees,
and latterly has been organist at the R.C.
cathedral in Adelaide, and a hard-working
member of the Universities’ Examination
Board. He is only 44 now.
William Clayton, present (unattended) at
the Adelaide Show, claims that (1) he will
be 100 next March; (2) he helped to build
the original Adelaide railway station; (3)
he helped to initiate Adam Lindsay Gordon

bier in 1861.
WILLIAM McKIE, Melbourne City
Organist, whose Sunday evening organ
recitals are being broadcast by the
national service over Australia one
this week won high praise.
L»i£e insurance was the job of the late
W. ,T. Affleck, of Brisbane, but it was only
one of his interests. He was born on a
Darling Downs farm, and when he finally
came to Brisbane he was soon identified
with the Royal National Association, h or
nearly 30 years he took a leading part in its
work and he helped to make Brisbane
“Exhibition” one of the most important
dairy-cattle shows in the world. Affleck was
the first in Queensland to institute the herd-
book system and the herd-book societies
which have done so much for the dairying
industry. Two years ago lie was elected
president of the association; he died at 64.
Vincent Shallcross, passed out in Perth at
64, had been a prominent figure in the min-
ing world since the end of last century.
He was a mining engineer well versed
in American methods; cyaniding was his
specialty. The late Dorrie Doolette and
lie were partners when a prospector in their
employ pegged out the Bullfinch and started
the excitement of 1910-11. Shallcross, always
on the cautious side, sold his interest for
£lOO, and bought it back for £lO,OOO. The
mine proved a solid producer for three or
four years, but it was so extravagantly over-
capitalised that few have cause to remember
it gratefully.
Charles Pearce, who has passed over in
Mount Morgan (Q.) at 63, found the Golden
Ridge, one of the richest shows on the new
Cracow goldfield. Shortly after selling the
mine to a southern syndicate for £16,000
Pearce was admitted to hospital, where he
died three weeks later. A Boer War and
Great War veteran, he had been prospecting
for gold in Queensland for many years with-
out much luck until his Cracow find.
No sooner was Sydney Myer off the boat
at Melbourne on his return from a visit
to U.S.A. and Europe than he announced
his intention of spending £200,000 in exten-
sions to his already spacious needle-to-an-
anchor store. All through the depres-
sion Myer has been keeping a few score
builders going.
John Lacey, one of those inhabitants of the
tropics, faded away untimely in Townsville
the other day at 77. John, who was known
from one end of North Queensland to the
other, was the first mail contractor to take
a packhorse mail from Cardwell, between
Cairns and Townsville, to Normanton, on
the Gulf of Carpentaria. The distance as
the ’plane flies is a meve 300 miles. But
the country in between is a tangle of tropi-
cal jungle and ragged mountain ranges,
and when Lacey traversed it was full
of wild and warlike abos. Lacey’s feat
in running that first mail without any help
from a defined track is still spoken of when
feats of bushmanship are discussed. Gold-
mining on the Croydon, Etheridge and
Georgetown fields followed, and from that
he switched to cattle-raising at Fiery
Downs, on the Etheridge. Sugar-growing at
Proserpine filled in the active old gentle-
man’s later years.
Robert Cameron, secretary of the Wallsena
(N.S.W.) Hospital, who passed out last
week at 69, was a Labor leader who hguie-
prominently in the coal strikes of over
years ago; he became acting-president of the
Miners’ Federation when Peter Bowling was
imprisoned. He was a native of Glasgow.
Onp of his sons, another Robert, is a Labor
M.L.A.
After 49 years as lone Lutheran minister
in Sydney, G. Schenk is retiring and return-
ing to Germany, although he has an Aus-
tralian family which is likely to bring him
bhck again. The pastor had a difficult tunc
during the war, when the bulk of the mem-
bers of his flock who remained uninterned
were under suspicion that brought many
hardships, and there were some hotheads
amongst them; it says a lot for the min-
ister’s tact that he himself escaped all such
suspicions.
Cecil W. Pearce Poole, dead at Lid-
combe (N.S.W.)* was one of Aus-
tralia’s most t industrious literary nomads.
Many country papers have published
columns of his shrewdly observant notes,
and numerous paragraphs and bits of
verse have appeared in The Bulletin dur-
ing the last 40 years under his signature.
The man himself was always something ot
a mystery. An Englishman, from Bristol
or thereabouts, he was intensely proud of
his country, but he was a good Australian,
too. In the ’eighties Poole gave up a job
on the Tamworth (N.S.W.) “Observer” to
become a wanderer and remained one. There
were few keener students of nature and bush
life,, and his impressions were conveyed with
the pen of a ready writer.
John Rawson Elder, who has just com-
pleted “The Letters and Journals of Samuel
Marsden, 1765-1838,” is Professor of His-
tory at Otago Uni. (M.L.). An authority

he came from Aberdeen Uni. in 1920, and
has published several works on the Shivery
Isles.

professorial staff of half a dozen U.S.A.
Universities during recent years, returns to
his native Melbourne as lecturer in Eliza-
bethan literature. He began as a journal-
ist, edited several financial and mining
papers, and was a leader-writer on Melbourne
“Herald” in 1918. Oliphant is one of the
foremost authorities on Elizabethan litera-
ture and Jacobean drama.
The force in Sydney has just said so-long
to James Bennetts. Supt. of Traffic. He
had been in that branch of the service almost
ever since it had been a branch —since 1900;
before that he had done duty in the ’Loo
and at Randwick. He had served his time
as a coachbuilder —be was born at Peak
Downs (Q.) —and they reckoned it would
be handy to have a tradesman to help them
decide when the hansom cabs of that period
ought to be laid up for repairs. His place

dent of Traffic, just retired.

Lynch. He got his lifts through the detec-
tive branch. But it is a shame to turn
these men out at 60. Bennetts looks good
for another 10 years’ valuable service.
The J. M. Joshua who iu these days is in
control of the “Br.vmay” matcli factories in
Australia is the same good Jew who helped
to establish whisky-distilling in this country
—“Every nation,” he says, “gets the Jew it
deserves.” Because he loves a scrap his
name is often iu the papers; and whenever
he either speaks or writes he is worth listen-
ing to. His three years’ presidency of the
Chamber of Manufacturers was about the

liveliest in the history of that august body.
Though near the retiring age. he doesn’t look
it, his prescription for old age being to
mix with young people and try to get their
point of view; probably for that reason lie
has never suffered from Pomposity, Perni-
cious Gentility or Frozen Feet. JPe also
thinks Brain Fag is really not nearly as
common as supposed. H'e has known very
many people—among them Ivreuger, the
“match king,” “who,” he says, “was a truly (
great man, and made the. other thieves look
like mere shoplifters.” Joshua is tolerant
and unconventional, but believes in British
standards of business morality, and is unfor-
giving of even a hairbreadth departure
from them.
P. D. Ferguson, Minister of Agriculture
in the Westralian Government, comes. of a
family which has done some real service to
the State. His grandfather, Dr. John Fer-
guson, arrived in the infant settlement 00
years ago. having for fellow-passengers the
parents of John Forrest, who was to cut
his name so deeply in Westralian history.
Dr. Ferguson took up land at the ill-
fated Australind settlement; later he was
appointed Colonial Surgeon. Later still, he
purchased land in the Upper Swan Valley
which impressed him as suitable for grape-
growing, and here his son Charles Ferguson,
the present Minister’s father, who is now
S 5, started in the ’sixties on what was to
be his life’s business, importing most of his
vines from the neighboring colony. That
was the origin of the Westralian wine in-
dustry.
At the funeral of George Russell, a
Bathurst pioneer, the other day four sisters
and two brothers were among the mourners,
their ages ranging from 83 to 72.
Major John Whitney, of Remuera, Auck-
land, has answered the last roll-call. Born
in Herefordshire 96 years ago he entered the
Army with a commission, saw active service
and became known as an expert game shot. A
year after his arrival in M.L. the Russian
war scare of 1885 led the Government to sug-
gest that he should manufacture ammuni-
tion. He started operations at Auckland :
in 1887 the concern became the Colonial
Ammunition Co., Ltd., and shortly after
Major Whitney started a sister business in
Melbourne. All Aussie and M.L. troops for
the Great War carried the product of the
C.A.C.’s .303 Mark VI. cartridges.

Mick, who is retiring after 43 years’ service,
has been railway officer-in-charge of the pier
since 1926, so he supervised the expon
of six harvests. One of the old railroaders
of the pre-Clapp school, Enright has served
under every district superintendent, and-has
relieved on every line between the Murray

The, slip of £3865 in last year’s net earn-
ings was a trifle disappointing. It was due
mainly to difficulties arising from a change
in the method of distributing the co.’s
products, the chairman says—early in the
term Marks and Saul wick, who handle
Kayser products and are interested in other
units of the A.K.M.-Yarra Falls group,
undertook distribution of A.K.M.’s goods.
On the other hand, the tariff and exchange
provided the co. with fresh opportunities,
while conditions in N. S. Wales had given
Victorian mills an advantage over local
manufacturers on the Sydney market.
Nevertheless, spending was restricted, and
competition for the business that was avail-
able very keen, which meant narrow mar-
gins. The £27,138 netted was 4.9 p.c. on
capital as against 5.5, 10.3, 13.5, 14.3 and
15.9 p.c. back to 1927. The div. was kept
at 5 p.e. ; it averaged 10.2 p.c., sweetened
with £90,000 of bonus scrip, for the nine
years to the close of accounts in 1930,
Better trade activity, especially towards
the close of accounts, and preparations for
further improvement are reflected in this
comparison of balance-sheet figures-

Thus to add £90,112 to the stocks item,
£33,561 to debtors’ balances, £12,625 to
shareholdings and reduce the amount coming
to trade creditors (£23.855) by £15,725, the
board gathered £137,685 of deposits, went to
its bankers for £6215 and drew upon cash,
etc., for £8835. Much depends upon the
figure at which stocks have been written.
Including this item the more or less liquid
surplus (£132,526) slipped £13,347 during
the twelvemonth.
The co. is chief of a progressive group which
covers practically every line of tlie textile
trade. Yarra Falls turns out the yarns
and makes woollens and worsteds as well;
Austral Silk and Cotton, formed in 1927,
produces cotton yarns and fabrics; A.Iv.M.
itself specialises in underwear; the latest
additions, Julius Kayser (Aust.) Pty. and
Rayon Pty., cover the silk hosiery and lin-
gerie field. A.K.M.’s holdings include
318,500 ords. in Yarra Falls, 25,480 shares
(now selling at 19s. 6d. on the market) in
the cotton co., 65,250 (25,250 were taken
up last year and paid to 10s. each) in
Kaysers and an undisclosed but small hold-
ing in Rayon. .
A.K.M.’s pound ords. fetch 235. in the
market as against 18s. a year ago. The
investor at 235. who looks for 5.2 p.c. on
his money counts on no more than a 6 p.c.
div. The cover is 265. in net assets. The
74 p.c. prefs. (there are 10.000 of them)
seldom come on to the market.

The almost complete cessation of home
building, which this co. has been financing
for the last 47 years, the moratorium, elimi-
nation of the personal covenant, interest-re-
duction legislation and stinging increases in
taxation, especially on incomes from pro-
perty, have struck the business its hardest
blow since the crisis of the ’nineties. But
the co. was then carrying liabilities nearly’
twice the size of its paid capital, and, hav-
ing put out large sums in new advances, it
paid no dividends for several' years, all
current profits (they were mostly small)
being absorbed by losses on foreclosures.
However, it was not to be thus caught again.
Though the net growth in advances during
the five years to the close of accounts in
1929 amounted to £100.940, the board had
not to go outside for the money. Moreover,
the debt, which is small, was nearly nine
times covered by cash and investments alone
at June 30:—

Last year’s reduction of £43,111 in the book
value of advances enabled £4271 to be
knocked off the debt, and Government securi-
ties (£61,099) and cash (£25.897) to be
strengthened by £13,501 and £3409 respec-
tively. Shares in other cos. were £463 lighter
at £10,703. The growth of £20,117 in the
property item was due to foreclosures, etc.
Prospects are that the co. will not be
able to find profitable employment for the
whole of its funds in the business. So 4s.
per share on the fully-paids and Is. 6d. on
the contribs. (paid to 17s. 6d.) is to be
returned, thus reducing paid capital from
£313,724 to £261,874 in 327.342 fully-paid
16s. shares. Payment is to be made by
transferring 1947 Consols at face value; frac-
tions of £lO will he paid in cash. A 5 p.c.
div. on £261,874 would call for £13,094, or
2.8 p.c. on total funds (capital and reserves
combined). Assuming that the capital to
be returned netted 4 p.c.. the balance of last
year’s net earnings was £19,006. Hopes are
that foreclosures have reached their peak,
and that with a little relief in taxation earn-
ings may strengthen a trifle as conditions
improve.
The market prices the scrip at 165., ex
capital payment. The cover is 295. in net
tangibles, book value.

In its first dozen years this 22-year-old
vendor of tobaccos, haircuts and sporting
goods, which runs a chain of shops and has
strong connections with suburban retailers,
paid a steady 10 p.c., sweetened with £4O 625
of bonus scrip. Then it went into debt to
finance property purchases, price-paring
became endemic, and, though the business
expanded, earnings and distributions have
been irregular for the last decade.
Last year’s special crop of troubles, in-
cluding the war in the retail tobacco trade
and reduced rentals, brought a further slip
of £22,834 in gross earnings (£102,772) ;
exes. (£106,377, including £3056 for depre-
ciation) _were pulled back £11.610. So a loss
of £3605 showed up as against profits of
4.6. 7.1, 8.4, 10.8 and 13.3 p.c. on capital back
to 1927, and shareholders were passed by for

There has been an abrupt falling away of
the high-class business for which the Aus-
tralia caters, due to the thinning of the
stream of country and inter-State visitors
to Sydney, the shyness of overseas tourists
and the lighter purses of all. Cuts in
charges have also contributed to the reduced
takings, on which the extra loading for taxa-
tion, the weight of the overdraft and the
call for renovations and renewals, always a
substantial item in a hotel of this kind, pressed
heavily. Slump left the co. with a vacant
allotment on which rates, taxes and interest
on borrowed money must he running away
with the best part of £lO,OOO a year. About
three years ago the board bought the old
N. S. Wales Government Savings Bank's
adjoining property in Martin-place for
£150,000, and went outside for most of it,
and demolished the building.
Last year’s loss, the first thing of its
kind since Sydney bought out the English
interests 22 years ago at £2 a share, was
due to the cost of renovating the first floor.
The co. has been very successful in the past:
£220,202 of the £422,169 of capital is gift
scrip, handed out since 1910, and divs. aver-
aged 9.5 p.c. for the 15 years to the close
of accounts in 1929. Business is now re-
ported to be improving, and the board is
considering the erection of an annexe of two
or three floors, with shops on the ground
one, on the spare allotment already referred
to. Dividend prospects will largely depend
upon the co.’s success or otherwise in this
connection.
The position as balance-sheet figures show
it is as follows :

Thus during the year liquids' shrank £4096,
and £2547 was added to the debt: so the
increase in excess liabilities (£144,145) was
£6643. The property item has remained un-
changed for the last three years.
The market prices the ords. at 14s. as
against 10s. a year ago and 345. 6d. two
years before that. The return at 14s. would
be 5.7 p.c. on a 4 p.c. div. basis. At 15s.
the prefs. return 6.6 pm., after allowing for
the statutory reduction of the div. to 5 p.c.
The book value of the net tangible cover is

This co., which now manufactures most of
its own requirements, does a large whole-
sale trade in motor accessories, bicycles and
radios. It paid £43,556 (not treated as an
asset herein) for the extensive goodwill of
the old A. G. Healing business about five
years ago, when the public snapped 50,000
prefs. to help finance the erection of new
premises in Melbourne and Adelaide.
Scarcely were building operations complete
than slump dealt the motor and ancillary
trades.a stunning blow. Thus, following net
earnings averaging 9.3 p.c. on ord. capital for
the first four years, a loss of £23,902 showed
up in 1931, when stocks were taken into
account at £40,211 below’ the previous year’s
figure. The worst of the trouble occurred
at the Sydney end and in the manufacturing
section in Melbourne.
The effective way in which the board has
grappled with its problems is made plain by
the appearance of £7669 of profit for the
12 months covered by the latest accounts.
Early in the term ss. per share (£53,035)
was struck off the ords.. reducing paid
capital to £233,905 in 72;200 £1 profs, and
137,860 ords. of 15s. each. This enabled
the p. and 1. debit, some removal exes, that
had been capitalised and £27,500 of the
goodwill item (now £16,000) to be rubbed
out of the accounts. Better results followed
reorganisation of the Sydney business. But
most headway was made on the manufactur-
ing side, especially in the radio section,
which is handicapped by the heavy cost of
distribution—the co. began to turn out its
own sets when the importation of Attwafer-
Kent goods, for which it held the agency,
was prohibited a couple of years ago. The
boom in push-bikes, tlie manufacturing line
on which the business was founded 38 years
ago, helped, too. Thus the outlook for
shareholders has much improved: the whole
of the capital and £lO5l besides is now
represented by tangibles.
The year’s better trading is further re-
flected in this comparison of balance-sheet
figures:—
1929. 1930. 1931. 1932.
£ £ £ £
Paid capital .. 286,940 286,910 286,940 233,905

Book debts, cash,
etc 123,206 108,30 S 90,200 105,848
Thus a reduction of £14,160 in the book
value of stocks (said to be conservatively
valued) and a growth of £9249 in the
amount coming to trade creditors were
accompanied by an expansion of £15,648 m
debtors’ balances and a contraction of
£10,581 in the overdraft, mortgages, etc.
The year’s improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£95,194 including stocks) was
£2820.
The prefs., which are covered by £3 ss.

For the last three years this energetic
retailer has been snapping up the Brisbane
stocks of southern traders and others who
have withdrawn from the softgoods business
in the northern capital. The latest purchase
was the whole of Foy and Gibson’s Bris-
bane stocks during the last term, and a
most beneficial arrangement with the vendor
co.’s Victorian mills followed, the board
says. Also, with the extension of the
Valley corner of the co.’s premises a year
or so ago, new departments were added,
and more people came to the store. But
the fight for turnover and the lift in primage
and sales taxes further narrowed margins;
so there was a slip of £9528 in last year's
gross earnings; exes, were £7678 heavier:—
1928. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Gross profit. . £261,380 £245,361 £185.486 £175,958
Exes 186,379 180,361 139,111 146,789
Net profit.. £75,001 £65,000 £46,375 £29.169
Thus, after transferring £1669 to taxation
rest account, there was enough to show 5
p.c. on capital as against 6.5, 11.8, 13.0,
13.6 and 14.3 p.c. back to 1927. That was
after adjusting the book value of stocks so
as to “leave no possible doubt about any
adverse market fluctuations in the near
future.” Though competition threatens to
remain keen, concerns like McWhirters, doing
a lively turnover and with a reputation for
shrewd buying, promise to be early out of
the wood. Still, it is doubtful ' whether
anything better than 5 p.c. need be expected
for a while.
Additions to the premises have added
£128,500 to the book value of fixed assets
over the last two years:—
1925. 1930. 1931. 1932.
Paid capital. . £550,000 £550,000 £550,000 £550,000

Cash invest-

Thus, to knock £7922 off the overdraft,
£2600 off the amount coming to trade credi-
tors and add £15,286 to the book value of
fixed assets, cash and debtors’ balances, etc.,
were reduced by £21,135 last year. Th(

And the uplift has continued: on September
22 the sterling price of lead had reached
£l3 6s. 3d., spelter £l5 355., copper (stand-
ard) £35 15s. and tin £154 Bs. 9d. There is
still some doubt as to the extent of speculative
buying. Manufacturers, however, are re-
ported to be covering their needs more freely,
especially in the cable-making and battery
trades. General opinion is that it would
iake very little increase in actual consump-
tion to support and further strengthen prices.
There is, however, ample room for a con-
siderable transfer of stocks from the hands
of producers to those of consumers. Tin
and copper are the two which will need to
be propped up. Much depends upon the
success or otherwise which attends the
efforts to lever up prices in the U.S.A.

Sulphide Corporation is reported to be
preparing for the erection of a plant at its
smelting works at Seaton Carew, England,
for the manufacture of zinc oxide and zinc
chemicals from its retorted zinc.
: I : * :J: ;f*
During the last decade B.H. Associated
Smelters at Port Piric (S. Aus.) recovered
an average of 146,000 tons of lead,
5.000.0000 z. silver and 43400 z. gold annually
from Broken Hill lead concentrates. Capital
expenditure for the ten years was £1,500,000,
largely in improving- working conditions and
overcoming plumbism; while £4,000,000 was
paid in wages and £2,600,000 for supplies,
stores, etc. The huge slag dump contains
over 580,000 tons of zinc. It is expected that,
when the price of the metal recovers suffi-
ciently, the co. will follow American ex-
amples and put down a fuming- plant to
recover the zinc.
Opal production in N.S.W. for 1931 was
valued at £2178,' making the total for the
State £1.599,000; but probably not more
than two-thirds of the finds in 'White Cliffs
in its early.days were reported. White Cliffs
and Lightning- Ridge have been the principal
producing centres, the opal occurring as a
narrow vein-filling in sandstone. At Tinten-
bnr, the only other field of importance, the
opal is,found in, a decomposed volcanic rock.
From a man on the spot: Excitement has
been caused at Alice Springs by the reported
find at The Granites, Gentralia, of a lode
some five miles long on the eastern end of
Michael Terry’s old Ivy leases. Some rich
seams were found by Jack Saxby in this
locality last year; but these failed to in-
terest mining cos. The field has been
well prospected since its discovery by the
late Allan Davidson many years ago, but
with little success. Some 400 oz. of alluvial
and leader gold have been won by fossickers
during the last 18 months. The field is
approximately 400 miles north-west of Alice
Springs, and 350 miles from Hall’s Creek
(W.A.). The road from Alice Springs is
a rough bush track, intersected by bad
sandy creeks, with a 200-mile dry stage.
( hapman’s boring party, which has been
drilling on the line of lode, lias obtained
good prospects. But lack of timber, the
uncertainty of obtaining an adequate supply
of water and the isolated position of the
field are serious drawbacks.
“Deep-lead": An elaborate survey of the
Ararat deep alluvial field, has shown the
exstcnce of a bar running parallel to the
main lead, and to the east. There is believed
to be a large area, exceeding 1,870,000 sq.
fathoms, of unworked wash. This does nor
include 40,000 sq. fathoms available in the
old Langi Logan and the Cathcart lead,
which ground averaged about 1.60 z. gold per
sq. fathom.
* * *
Further work is to be undertaken to test
the extensive deep lead system at Guildford
(Vic.), where operations have been carried
on spasmodically since 1887. At Guildford
two leads join and take a course west for
three miles to Strangways. In the vicinity
of Guildford 4ft. 6in. of wash lies at a depth
of 50ft., while at Strangways the depth
increases to 240 ft. in parts, with wash vary-
ing from 2ft. to 12ft.
* *
At the recently unwatered Yankee mine.
Trentham (Yic.), the first clean-up of 240
tons obtained from development work on
330 ft. and 230 ft. levels yielded 630 z. of gold,
while 5 tons pyritic concentrates obtained
carried S-ioz. The lode, 3ft, to oft, wide,
is strong and persistent. An air compressor
is now being installed.
B. H. Prop, has sunk the main shaft on
the Kingston mine at Bolangum (Vic.)
to 310 ft. Favorable reports have been
received, and an adjoining lease of 35 acres
has been acquired.
Titanium Products, which is developing
the ilmenite sands at King Island (Tas.),
has finished the bridge over the Fraser River
and the road to the mine. Concrete founda-
tions for the concentrating equipment, which
includes magnetic separators, have also been
completed. It should not be long before
production begins.
* * * *
During August the Palmer River Gold
Co.’s dredge (N.Q.) treated 37,300 c.y. for
58oz. of gold, valued at £406, making the
return £1,112 over the last three months.
Alterations have been made to the gold-sav-
ing equipment, and better results are ex-
pected when the dredge starts upstream.
Lately a number of prospectors have been
looking over the southern end of the Palmer
River field, and a few small but rich occur-
rences have been reported in the vicinity of
old Groganvillo.
The Golden Mile Co., Cracow (Q.), has
ordered a 50-ton-a-day plant, to be erected
and running in December, from Ruwolt’s,
Melbourne. A 91 p.c. extraction was
obtained from a trial parcel of ore after, fine
grinding in a ball mill working in a closed
circuit with a classifier and using corduroy
strake concentration similar to that in opera-
tion at Ivalgoorlie and in S. Africa. For
the present the sands and slimes are to be
accumulated and retreated with additional
plant later. A new shaft is expected to
provide the water required.
* * * *
In the Bowen (N.Q.) district the old
Normanby. Marengo, Bimurra, Mount Gor-
don and Andromache River fields arc being
raked over again. A rich leader is reported
from Middle Camp, near Ukalanda; details
are not yet available. A reef, averaging Bin.
in width and giving assays of approximately
loz. to the ton, has been located on the
Andromache River, about 22 miles from
Proserpine, and a single stamp has been
erected. All eyes at the moment are on
Mount Coolon, where production is to com-
mence in about a month’s time. The most
modern gold-treatment plant in the Com-
monwealth will then put through 250 tons a
day.
*** • *
The. Depression mine, on the Ley burn field,
Warwick (Q.), recently crushed one parcel
of 22 tons 3cwt. for 260 z. 13dwt. of gold,
and another of 10 tons for 12oz. At the
bottom of a 57ft. shaft the reef is 12in.
wide. At Thane’s Creek the Anzac is the
most promising show. Here a lode Bft. wide
is traceable for nearly half a mile; a. shaft
has been sunk 27ft. on the hanging wall
side, and 40 tons of ore is ready for crush-
ing. An assay showed over 2oz. to the ton;
but the battery can make the only assay of
gold-stone worth having. Upwards of 89
men are at work on the various fields in the
district.
* * * *
At Lolworth Creek, Charters Towers
(N.Q.), a Sydney syndicate has secured a
six months’ working option over seven of
the best, claims on the field. The Lucky
Hit, which has yielded some rich' returns
from recent crushmgs, is being tackled first.
Here half a dozen men are busy deepening
the shaft. James Bowry, of Charters
l owers School of Mines, is managing the:
syndicate’s affairs on the field.
* * # ~.
Commonwealth Mines Syndicate (Q.).
which has a concession of 70,000 acres
embracing the Palmer River and Gilberton
alluvial goldfields, has appointed Pellew and
Harvey, a London firm, as consulting engi-
neers. Preliminary consideration is now being
given to the treatment of the alluvial by
large electric dredges.
* * * *
Metals Recovery, Ltd., resumed opera-
tions at Mt. Cobalt (Q.) early in July, and
is treating about 4 tons per day. If results
are satisfactory the tonnage is to be sub-
stantially increased. A parcel of 17-J tons
of picked stone recently yielded 2.9 tons of
cobalt valued at £6lO.
* * * *
Work still proceeds on the Sunset Ex-
tended at Ravenswood (N.Q.), and the
stone looks promising enough" to keep the
men employed. The cross-cutting now being
done should prove whether further expendi-
ture is warranted.
Li the Strathpine district (Q.) a deposit
■ s ! alo J ias been located by chief geolo-
gist Ball. Tests show 50 gallons of oil per
ton—-a fine yield, though about half that
obtained from the Newnes (N.S W 4 de-
posits.
. Much-travelled C. H. Wray, one-time field
inspector for Bewick, Moreing and Co., and
later connected with Consolidated Goldfields
of S. Africa, considers that the Ashburton,
Fortesque and Gascoyne rivers offer possibili-
ties for gold-dredging ventures. Hence efforts
are being made to raise capital for trial
boring. Some geologists bold that these
rivers once flowed south-west from Econo re
to Augusta, and from Wiluna to .Turien Ray
via Moora, that their ancient courses ran
over auriferous belts, and therefore probably
contain gold in payable quantities at depth.
Present proposals, however, are not based on
the theory of the ancient courses of those
streams. _ Since trial boring of the fiats
along their existing courses would not b -
costly, there is no good reason why it should
not be undertaken.
Lake Mew and Star's reorganisation
scheme has cost a lot of money. During
August, special _ development took £6550.
while_the extension programme mopped up
£27,079. Under these heads substantial
expenditure has been incurred each month
for over a year; but within the next three
months special expenditure is expected to
disappear.
Great Boulder's ore reserves at the end of
.1930 were put at 87,000 tons. During 1931,
97,789 tons was extracted, and development
work had raised the total ore blocked to
132,139 tons at the end of the year. The
latest estimate is 153,947 tons, containing
62,4910 z. of gold, exclusive of probable re-
serves estimated at 57,053 tons; a total of
211,000 tons. Gold to the value of
£18,000,000 has alreadv come out of the
mine.
Golden Horseshoe New (W.A.), which
recently reduced its 4s. shares to 35., has
treated approximately one million tons, or
one-tliird. of its available heap of. tailings at
Kalgoorlie. The plant is highly efficient and
m good condition; so with a view to length-
ening the life of the co. efforts are being
made to acquire other tailings dumps, which
may include Associated Northern's, for
retreatment on a profit-sharing basis. The
company has an available eash balance of
£120,000.
In its search in the West for a suitable
gold show, B. H. Prop, did not forget the old
Kothsay mine, unworked for quarter of a
century. Long ago it yielded ioz. stone, but
extraction difficulties were too "great to make
the show attractive in those days. It is
now considered that flotation would over-
come the extraction problem. Much there-
fore depends upon whether there is enough
ioz. stuff or better.
Adelaide directors, with their experts,
continue to arrive in Westralia to view
shows offering for option. The Cornishman.
south of Southern Cross, is to be inspected,
and so is the Radio Deeps, north of the
Cross. On a previous occasion Adelaide
gave the Deeps a trial, but did not fancy
it. Since then the show has produced some
hundreds of tons of 2oz. ore, and is respond-
ing well to development.
In 1931 North Kalgurli’s receipts totalled
£21,715; exes, made off with £19,088. At
the end of Dec. ore reserves were estimated
at 274,800 tons, of which 170.000 is stated to
be actual and the balance probable. The co.’s
eash and ore reserve position has since been
much strengthened.
Sons, of Gwalia’s profit for August was
over £lO,OOO in Australian currency; the best
monthly showing this year. The co. still owes
the State Government £40,000, but it is now
in a position to pay off the debt,
A lease has been pegged to the south-west
of Hannan’s North Extended, which is now
being developed by the 8.11. P. On this new
area a sulphidic lode has been traced for
over half a mile, and assays up to 2oz. per
ton have been reported.
* * * *
The Mararoa Co., having had no luck so
far with option agreements, may work the
show at Cue (W.A.) itself. Such a deci-
sion would mean reconstruction. Still, the
high price of gold may encourage share-
holders to risk a little more in a promising
venture.

The old Lord Bobs mine, six miles south
of Coolgardic (W.A.). is showing up well;
a recent crushing of 32 tons returned 670 z.
This mine has been worked off and on for
25 years.
In Maoriland 13 new cos. have been
formed this year to hunt for gold. Activity
is greatest in the South Island, where many
old concerns are showing good yields. For
the quarter ended June 30 Backwater Mines,
Reefton, recovered 58650 z.; the Alexander!
another Reefton show, 21230 z.; King
Solomon, Gore, 7660 z.; Okarito Five Mile
Dredging, South Westland, 4750 z.
An English syndicate with command of
£250,000 has secured an option over a large
area of alluvial gold wash along the Moly-
neux River (M.L.). Should boring prove
satisfactory, two large dredges are to be
installed.
Okarito Gold Dredging Co., South West-
land (M.JL.) netted £8202 for the half-year
ended April 2. Two Od. dividends were paid.
For the period 19380 z. were won from
173,000 c.y., at a cost of 4.3 d. per yard.
Profit was 11.4 d. per yard.
The low price of tin has hit the staff and
coolies of the Malayan tin dredges hard.
Staff salaries, which have never been high,
considering the isolation and conditions
generally, have been reduced by 20 p.c., and
the wages of the coolies by 50 p.c. About
half the coolies have been sent back to their
own territories at Government expense, and
those remaining in the employ of the tin
companies arc shouldering much heavier
duties.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
Alpha: Dunlop-Perdriau’s scrip appears to be fully-
priced at 16s. 9d. Anthony Horderns’ prefs. were
12 months in arrears at the close of last accounts ;
the ords. may have to wait for a while. Morris
Hedstrom and Castlemaine Perkins Brewery are
worth considering. .. . X.Y.Z.: (l) Unless covered by
the policy contract, surrender values are an arbitrary
matter. The co.’s prospects of earning bonuses
within the next few years are anything but bright.
If you are unable to keep up premium payments,
ask for a paid-up policy. (2) Subject to special
agreement, the assets of a partnership after dis-
solution are applied to (a) payment of debts to
persons who are not partners, (b) payment of advances
(as distinct from capital) made by partners, (c)
payment to each partner rateably the amount due
to him in respect of capital, (d) residue distri-
buted in the proportion in which profits are divisible.
If the partnership assets are insufficient to satisfy
the claims of outside creditors, then each partner
is liable jointly with his co-partners. (3) Doubtful
whether it will develop into anything worthwhile.
A.P.; Know nothing of it; send prospectus or
name and address of secretary.... R.A.W.: Both are
good gambles. South Kalgurli’s success has been
due to the rich deposit in Australia East lode,
now becoming depleted. The future of the mine
depends upon developments in the new leases to
the north of the present property... .8.C.: (1) Early
reports concerning new developments on X lode and
the general buying wave lifted the market price of
the scrip too high. (2) Yes. (3) Bright enough,
subject to fluctuations in exchange. See B. 14 /9/’32.
. ...H.D.: The decision of the majority of bond-
holders is binding on all. Thus you cannot now
give a good title to the freehold, which has been
transferred to the trustee for the bondholders as
security for a loan to finance marketing, etc.


THE OTHER FELLOW’S MIND.
The Wool Inquiry
Dear Bulletin, —I have attended some
sessions of the Wool Inquiry Committee,
and if any benefit to the industry comes
from that cumbersome body I’ll take up
weather forecasting for a living. “Evidence”
is voluntary, and witnesses aimlessly wander
over the continent from Normanton to Nar-
racoorte, from Bermagui to Broome; cranks
and near-cranks tediously unwind yards and
yards of fantastic plans to save everyone
from disaster by doing impossible things.
References of a hostile nature to brokers,
buyers and graziers’ councils and organisa-
tions cause a sudden drop in the tempera-
ture, and bored reporters cease from scrib-
bling and are at rest. The people we are
anxious to get hold of, brokers and buyers,
avoid the inquiry as if it were a decom-
posing goanna; a properly-constituted tri-
bunal would have the power to drag them
in and make them “explain” a lot of pecu-
liar things about marketing. The end of
this hopeless inquiry will see a ton of chaff
to be sifted for hardly enough grain to pro-
vide a robust cock-sparrow with breakfast.
But we are going to keep up the demand
for a proper commission, and we’ll get it
too. —Yours etc., An Old Grazier.
The Man Who Was Caught
Dear Bulletin,— Unless the banks can do
a two-way business in exchange, it is imprac-
ticable to maintain the existing high rate.
A bank can only buy at £25 per cent, pre-
mium provided it can sell at £25 10s. per
cent. In the face of this fact we have the
primary producers’ spokesmen clamoring for
a still higher rate. If it was good banking
practice to unpeg the rate when funds were
so urgently needed in London, surely it is
now time that the movement in the oppo-
site direction took place. We have so many
theorists meddling with what is normally a
simple procedure that the result, unless a
miracle happens, will be a sorry mess. Why
should the rest of Australia be penalised
because a number of farmers and graziers
have followed the boom and been caught with
land at high prices? In the past, if a man’s
judgment proved wrong and values fell, he
had either to cut his loss or get off the place,
and someone else went in at a much lower
figure and was thereby enabled to “make a
do of it.” A lot of these graziers seem to
think that if they are forced off, no more
wool will be grown. Bunkum! If Smith
doesn’t- use the land to grow wool, Jones
will. It all boils down to this: having
bought this high-priced land, they want to
hang on to it whatever the cost to the rest
of Australia. They, or a lot of them, over-
look the fact that they got their start when
in one of the previous depressions some poor
devil had to get off and they went in at £4
to £5 per acre for first-class land. —Yours,
“1893.”
The Graziers’ Association
Dear Bulletin, —The N.S.W. Graziers’
Association holds an annual election of gen-
eral councillors. At that point the boasted
democracy of the assoc, ceases and an oli-
garchy takes control. The councillors, as
soon as they are returned to pow-er, become
subject to a decree under Rule 34 which com-
pels them to appoint 10 outsiders, for not one
of whom a single vote in the election had
been cast. .To six of these ten privileged
persons the supreme power vested with and
known as the Executive Council is forthwith
given. Let us endeavor to imagine the out-
cry there would have been if the N v S. Wales
United Aus. party, after being returned to
power, had been obliged to elect a Ministry of
men upon whose qualifications the electors had
been deprived of the right to pronounce a
judgment. Such a thing is unthinkable.
Yet it is the system of representation of
which every woolgrower in N.S.W. is the
victim to-day. Can there be any wonder
at his rebellion? The councillors elected by
the woolgrowers should elect the executive
council from their own number, but their
power to do this, which democracy says is
the inalienable possession of the elector, is
usurped from them by Rule 34.
Attempts have been made by delegates to
conference to have this rule deleted from
the constitution, but the rule confers a
voting strength upon its beneficiaries cap-
able of vetoing the voice of many hundreds
of members. The seething discontent among
woolgrowers throughout Australia, evidenced
in many cases by open rebellion in N.S.W.*
Queensland and Westralia on the vital
question of representation, can no longer
be ignored by the controlling bodies.
One of the vital questions which awaits
an answer and upon which the woolgrower
appeals to the court of public opinion is.
has this Rule 34 within the constitution of
the Graziers’ Assoc, of N%S.W., which clearly
violates the principle of majority rule, the
power to confer upon a body of independent
men the supreme authority they claim to
have by virtue of it —that of exercising the
sacred right to speak for the majority of
the woolgrowers of this State during the
gravest crisis in the history of the industry?
-—Yours etc., Harold Sims.
Is Protection Getting a Fair Deal?
Dear Bulletin, —Not only the primary
producer, but the community generally, is,
under our brand of Protection, being plun-
dered by the greedy and bled to buoy up the
inefficient. The Bulletin has suspected
some of this, and lias demanded efficiency
and honesty. A worth-while programme
that, and in its carrying out some attention
might be given to the “internal dumper” as
well as his overseas equivalent. Protection,
as originally conceived, meant protection of
the people, and, to make that effective,
experience teaches that prices of Austra-
lian manufactures should be capable of being
legally pegged against any reduction not
traceable to lower costs of labor or of raw
material. Such measure of security against
“internal dumping” should be available on
application to those having the courage and
enterprise to give the people service on the
basis of reasonable profit—once again with
all necessary safeguards. The just-passed
wmter of unusual severity meant greater
discomfort to thousands of the people be-
cause. under a tariff which protects a lot
of things as well as industry, so ordinary
E manufacture and so desirable an aid to
human comfort as knitting wool has been
obtainable only at a full 100 per cent over
a fair price. And so on and on. —lours
faithfully, Alan W. Campbell (Q.).
Basic Wage and Farm Labor
Dear B., —I can’t agree with you that
the worker would be better off without a
basic wage. This is a N.S.W. fruit-growing
district, and here, under the rural basic
wage, it was easy a few years ago to get up
to about £4 a 'week for general orchard
work. Growers did well despite this wage.
(I know, because I was and still am a
grower myself.) What happened when
rural awards were abolished? This present
season, with oranges and mandarins at the
profitable rates of ss. to 9.5. a case, is a
good average example. I could forward
names ,of more than 30 growers who have
poor beggars toiling for them at four and
five shillings a day without keep. If this
is not dirty exploitation I will eat my hat
(and I am not fond of rabbit). Years back
I worked outlandish hours for a Clarence
River dairyman for £1 a week, and stayed
there for. three years, only because this was
ss. a week more than the average wage.
Monthly cream bills netted for this cocky
over £BO a month. The Bulletin wastes
a lot of sympathy, and says the man on the
land has a lot to put up with in drought,
flood, etc. But so have shipowners with
wrecks at sea, and carriers with blow-outs
in tyres and so on. Years of experience have
taught me that the average of my brothers on
the land are confirmed squealers and hard,
inhumane squealers at that. —Yours, Bonzo.
Where Is Our Public Spirit?
Dear Bulletin',-—A recent par. on “How
the Money Goes” (B. 31/8/’32) offers a
striking example of the tolerance of the
average Australian towards anyone who
cheats authority. In “Gad’s” gang were
the local postmaster and others who drove
their own cars and even hired household help.
Yet it never occurred to “Gad” that this
swindle should be brought to anybody’s
notice. Nearly anyone can tell of tax-
dodgers, drawers of pensions who have no
right, to them and various other impostors,
yet there must be very few who have enough
public spirit to make the facts known in the
right quarter. “Gad” complains that the
poor dole recipient gets least of all out of
it. He cannot expect anything else while
all these frauds continue. If so much hard-
taxed money were not going in frauds, the
genuine dole recipient would have a better
chance. —Yours, J. R. R.
Married Women Teachers
Dear B.,—The claim 0 f the right of mar-
ried women to continue teaching will cut
no ice in Victoria, which many years ago
abandoned the system once and for all. The
trouble was that large numbers did the
“three really different things” mentioned
by “C.D.D.” (B. 31/8/’32) —“getting mar-
ried, bearing children and rearing them” —
in addition to a fourth, practising the most
nerve-racking of professions, viz., training
other people’s children from infancy to
adolescence, in schools crowded with pupils,
all inquisitive, and some, as a matter of
course, naturally vulgar.. As a young male
teacher, in a classroom of 180 young Aus-
tralians, I worked with two married-women
assistants who staggered daily to their brain-
and body-wearying work right up to the
week of confinement, returning very shortly
after. I learned enough then to satisfy
me that this thing should not be allowed a
day longer. Since the embargo, Vic. has
needed competent teachers sorely, at one
period having to import them, but never has
even a' suggestion been made to re-admit
married women to the permanent staff. —
Yours, Teacher for a Half-Century (Vic.).
Our Education System
Dear B., —Like most educationists. A. J.
Law (B. 7/9/’32) is concerned solely with
questions of technique. The objective of an
education system is a question of public
policy. The method by which the policy
is applied is its technique. The educational
objective of every modern State is
to produce citizens, not thoughtful indivi-
duals. Since real democracy is a myth, the
type of citizen aimed at is one wdio helps
the aims of the holders of po-wer in the
State. The assumption is that the holders
of power know what is best for the State.
The answer to that is, Look at the world
to-day. We have had mass education now
for upwards of half a century, and the con-
dition of the world suggests that what we
want is not more stereotyped citizens, but
more thoughtful individuals. It is doubtful
if the stereotyped citizen spends his leisure
any better than the illiterate Elizabethan
did. He lives contentedly in a house that
would be intolerable to a Greek of the age
of Pericles. His ideas on economics are
given him by professors as hidebound as
himself. He has his opinions on inter-
national affairs and local politics provided
by daily newspapers and radio. The lack
of courageous individuals has kept society
helpless and inert for three years in face
of a crisis which threatens to destroy civil-
isation in a welter of insurrections and wars
for trade. Mr. Haw can vary his technique
as much as he likes, but while the objec-
tives of education remain what they are, the
production of thoughtful individuals will
have to be a matter for private enterprise.
—Yours, F. S. (Vie.).
A Red Herring in the Pastoral Industry
Dear Bulletin, —The main cause of dis-
tress in the grazing industry is over-capi-
talisation. We have had low prices before
and the industry has survived. Moreover,
production costs, though still outrageously
high, are being steadily reduced, and pas-
toralists are everywhere practising rigid
economy in their private expenditure. All
in vain unless something is done to reduce
that mountain of debt (legacy of the land
boom that followed the war years) which
bears intolerably upon our principal indus-
try. It is easy to blame the graziers for
excessive borrowing and booming, but we
are all equally to blame, not least amongst
us, either, those large financial institutions
which made money so perilously easy to
obtain. Yet to-day we see some of these
big institutions trailing the red herring of
a high exchange rate in their wake, and
graziers have failed to detect the fraud.
They have indeed gone further and joined
the aforesaid financial institutions in an
unholy alliance to inflate the exchange
rate. There are two alternatives —one is
to increase income, the other to decrease
fixed charges, and it is obviously to the
interests of lenders to ignore the latter. Yet
the high exchange rate only provides a very
precarious and impermanent solution of the
pastoral problem. Moreover, its repercus-
sions elsewhere in the economic sphere
make even the temporary virtues of an
inflated exchange rate extremely doubtful.
In the final issue only a rational reduction
of those boom debts with which the indus-
try is hopelessly burdened will save the
situation. —Yours, Loma.
THE EQUAL SACRIFICE.
“Members of the N.S.W. State Ministerial party yesterday rejected the Ministry’s proposal of a 15 p.c. cut in Parliamentary
salaries of £705 a year, and decided in favor of a cut of 12s. 6d. per week, as made in the basic wage.”
THE POLITICIAN: “My dear fellow, as you can see, the unemployed want food. We must make equal sacrifices to
give it to them. I will take out a spoonful from mine and a spoonful from yours—that’s fair, is. i't it?"

TRAVEL SUPPLEMENT.
OUR FATHERS’ SHIPS AND OURS.
OX January 18, 1788, Captain Phillip, in
the Supply, reached Botany Bay, and
reconnoitred. The result was dis-
appointing; so, taking with him his second-
captain, Hunter, he left in a boat to find out
if there was anything* better close at hand.
Passing into what is now Sydney Harbor,
which had been described by Cook, who did
not trouble to enter it, as a bay in which
there appeared to be good anchorage, he fixed
upon Sydney Cove as a landing place. On
January 25, again in the Supply, he re-
entered the harbor, and next day landed.
The event is recalled now for the purpose
of saying that the Supply was of 170 tons
burthen. It is true that she was the smaller
of the King's ships on that momentous ex-
pedition. The Sirius, the guardsliip of the
First Fleet, was of either 520 or 612 tons:
both figures are on record. The other nine
units of the fleet —transports (6) and store-
ships (3) —ranged from 274 to 430 tons.
The Sirius, the mammoth among the 11, was
100 ft. long, with a 12ft. depth of hold. In
such cockleshells the founders of Australia
came across uncharted seas to their new
home.
Nor were the ships of that great immi-
grant fleet which brought the stalwarts of
the race to the new continent —down, say,
to the ’forties—very much better. Many a
man now grown old will remember the tales
his father told of such as the Duchess of
Northumberland. Three hundred immigrants
she carried, with water and stores enough
for a voyage that might last six months;
and the Duchess was of 541 tons. Dig into
the early records of Sydney and you will read
of a meeting held in 1819 protesting against
the regulation which prohibited any vessel
of less than 350 tons entering into the trade
between Australia and the Mother Country.
The meeting’s idea was that, the limit should
be reduced to 150 tons. That was only a
little more than 100 years ago. Twenty years
later vessels of 600 tons were still bringing
our fathers to Australia; and proud many of
them were of the ships that carried them.
The Majestic, of the White Star line, car-
ries a crew of 1150. Her length is 956 ft.;
she is as broad as the great Sirius, of the
First Fleet, was long; she is of 56,551 tons
gross measurement and 64,000 tons displace-
ment. She has four screws, driven by tur-
bines that*develop 100,000 h.p. Her average
speed on the Atlantic crossing is 25 knots.
She has 1245 staterooms and accommodation
for 4100 passengers. Her main dining-room,
with a domed ceiling 31ft. high, will seat 700
people ; the space in her interior equals that
of 400 eight-roomed houses.
And the Majestic is to be dwarfed by the
new Cunarder, now being built, of 72,000
tons.
THE ROMANCE OF GREAT FLEETS.
There is romance in the story of these
great shipping lines. The days of the old
clippers figure in several of them. The
White Star, which now floats over the Majes-
tic, claimed to be still the world’s greatest
liner, was once the house-flag of Pijkington
and Wilson, whose magnificent sailing-ships
were among the busiest of that busy fleet,
which brought the overseas adventurers to tin
fabulous gold-rushes of Victoria. But already
the steamship had begun to make long voy-
ages.' The P. and O. Co. was the pioneer in
Australian waters; its Chusan had left
Southampton on May 16, 1852, and tied up
in Sydney Harbor on August 13. She was
followed by the Sydney and the Australian ,
and before the year was out Gibbs, Bright
and Co. had bought the Great Britain, of
no less than 3700 tons, and sent her to Aus-
tralia with 630 passengers.—a number to take
the breath away ! Such things made all the
difference in the world to the clipper fleet;
and one writes it with some regret that in
1867 Mr. T. ll'. Ismay, of Liverpool, bought
the White Star house-flag and all the good-
will that it meant for a trifling sum. Upon
that modest foundation the great White Star
line was built. But, though we may marvel
at the proportions of the modern Majestic.
avo shall hope to be forgiven if w T e dwell
more fondly on the Australian history that
tne flag made in sail. It floated over the
first clipper-ship that ever came to anchor in
Sydney Harbor; it floated over that marvel
of the age of canvas, the White Star, of 2333
tons, which carried, besides her captain and
four deck-officers, a surgeon and a chaplain!
There is more of the romance of personal
struggle and success in the story of the great
Cunard line. Samuel Cunard was. born and
brought up at Halifax, his father of German
parentage, his mother Margaret Murphy.
They Avere poor, laboring people, and their
youngster’s first money came from gathering
and selling wildfloAvers. He invested it in
fish and chips, made a bit of money that
Avay and then began building fishing boats.
That led him on to acquiring interests in
bigger sailing-ships; and at 45 or there-
abouts be had a very tidy fortune. For years
he had dreamed of building something that
would cross the Atlantic under steam, and
in 1832 he put a good part of his fortune
into the Royal William. Avhich the next
year, all being ready for the great enterprise,
was the first ship ever to cross an ocean
Avholly under steam. All her predecessors
had made more or less use of sail.
At this time Atlantic mails were carried
to and fro in Government brigs, under un-
certain sail; but when the Admiralty adver-
tised.for offers of a contract service, Cunard
decided that the time had come for the big-
gest thing in steamship construction that the
Avorld had seen. Crossing the Atlantic, lie cap-
tured the imagination and support of Burns
and Melver, prominent shipowners, and
together they made a bid for the carriage of
the mails. As soon as it was accepted they
began to build four steamships; and the
pioneer of them, the Britannia, with .Cunard
himself among the 63 passengers, left Liver-
pool on July 4. 1840. The vessel made
the_ voyage in 14 days; later in the year
a 6 hip, the Acadia, clipped three days
off Hus, and thereafter the run Avas finished
in 11 days as an ordinary thing. At the
great dinner given to Ounard, at which 2000
people were present, Daniel Webster, tin;
man who made the dictionary, was the prin-
cipal speaker. The new Cunarder now build-
ing will cover the distance from Southamp-
ton to New York via Cherbourg in less than
four days; she will be nearly 70 times the
tonnage of the original Britannia. Inci-
dentally, Samuel Cunard is one of the few
Americans who have accepted an English
knighthood. He died in London in 1864 at
the age of 78.
TOURIST BOATS.
An Australian, turning into Thomas Cook’s
headquarters in London a few years ago, ex-
plained that lie was at a loose end for a
few weeks, that he had had enough of British
and Continental sight-seeing and thought
perhaps a sea-tour might appeal to him —
had they anything to offer him ? They pro-
duced particulars of no less than 42. They
could book him to the midnight sun by way
of the fiords of Norway; they could show him
Iceland, where instead of glaciers and polar
bears he would find a clean and thriving
city; there were half a dozen or more tours
of the Mediterranean; there were tours of
the Baltic and the Adriatic; tours to Algiers
and Morocco; Egyptian tours; tours of
Spanish ports and of S. America and half a
dozen three-day cruises.
The stay-at-home Australian scarcely yet.
realises what the older world is doing in
the way of organised sea-tours. He knows
much about great lines of steamships that
keep to their own well-ploughed tracks; of
recent years he has learned a good deal
about round trips—to Europe via America
and home via Suez, or vice versa; in still
more recent years he has become acquainted
with the “tourist class boats” of the great
English lines. But, except, that at wide
intervals an American ship has brought, a
few hundred tourists to Sydney and less
often to Melbourne, we have known from
practical experience hardly anything of the
vessel that wanders away from its home-
port to crowd all the sight-seeing it can
into one, two, three, maybe six months.
And the chances are we have decided, as
we have seen the scurrying passengers of
the American tourist ship “doing” (say)
Sydney in three days, that that is no way
to see the world. But it is a very good way
to see a great deal of the world. The motor-
tourist who goes from Melbourne to Bris-
bane, taking a turn, it may be, around a
few of the larger towns on the way, man-
ages in even half an hour to get a fair
impression of most of them. He doesn’t want
to know whose name is over the door of the
pub, or whether the picture-show is open
every night or only two nights a week : he
wants a picture of the place to take away
in his memory; and it is astonishing how
quickly it can be photographed. The sea-
tourist has learned all about that.
At ordinary times the American likes you
to think of his country as a favored land
where a million comes naturally to the man
who attends strictly to business. If you ask
him whether he lias the million, lfis national
pride will compel him to say “Why, sure!”
And because the over-entliusiastic press-
agent has played up to this in some respects
quite admirable little weakness, Australia
has regarded the sea-tour as something speci-
ally designed for millionaires. In fact, these
tours are designed to suit most sorts of
pockets. Some, in Europe especially, are
surprisingly cheap; if you ask why, it is
explained that this isn’t a one-way traffic —
there is no danger of having to come back
half-empty. From Liverpol and Southamp-
ton there are 12-day one-class tours for £l2.
FOREIGN TRAVEL MADE EASY.
There was until a year or two ago
—perhaps still is—a courtly old gentle-
man who did odd jobs for visitors to
Nice, in the South of France, when
he could get them to do. He would tell
you that 20, 30, 40 years ago he was a
courier, and had travelled Europe with many
very famous people—and he would add,
apparently drawing a distinction, some very
rich ones from “the colonies.” “I would
meet them at Calais, at Marseilles, at
Naples, and all their troubles would be
over. But now—who wants couriers? The
war killed the last use a changed world had
for them. Once ladies would not travel
without a wardrobe. To-day—pooh ! —they
will see Europe on a handbag!”
But the change in female fashions wasn’t
wholly responsible for the disappearance of
the courier. The language difficulty no
longer exists. It is not easy nowadays to find
a hotel within the ordinary tourist routes
where English is not spoken. The tourist
bureaus, too, have their agencies everywhere;
and they are extraordinarily helpful. There
was a time when if you thought of a Cook’s
tour you thought of a mixed mob of people,
led by a guide, generally ill-educated and pro-
bably vulgar, who took the company in
hand, and rushed them hither and thither,
keeping guard over them like a drill-in-
structor with a class of schoolboys. You can
find the “mixed mob” to-day, though you
cannot find the ill-educated and vulgar drill-
sergeant.
But the “individual tour” is the bureaus
greatest service to the modern traveller.
You will probably have your own little
party of two or three or four. The bureaus

still chief among them —will map your tour
for you; book your railway and motor trips;
reserve your hotel accommodation; arrange
for your meals ; have guides and porters
awaiting you where necessary; even, in
most cases, they will relieve you of the
problem of whom to tip and how much. You
tell them what in a general way you want
to see and how much you are prepared to
spend. They will choose your hotel and
other accommodation accordingly. They will
hand you an itinerary, with a wallet of rail-
way and other tickets and orders and
coupons. You pay the bureau; it pays
the hotel and other services. On the
coupons you do not use you can get a refund.
It is travel robbed of discomfort; and because
the goodwill of the great tourist agencies is
worth so much to hotels and other caterers,
it is the rule almost everywhere that the
bureau coupons, command better service than
your own hard money could purchase, not-
withstanding that it is the hotels and other
services which pay the agency’s commission.
To some extent the place of the old
courier has been taken by the chauffeur.
Almost every great automobile builder has
several on his books—-ready to pilot the trav-
elling party over most part's of Europe. It
is quite easy for the Australian, travelling
via Suez, to pick up a car in Italy or France,
with a driver who knows much more of
Europe than the old courier did.
The organisation for the handling of pas-
sengers’ luggage has also been greatly
developed. Many an Australian, contem-
plating the round trip, has hesitated to take
ship to Vancouver or San Francisco because
of imagined difficulties with baggage in the
many “ston-overs.” There need be no
worry on that account. The passenger who
hands over his surplus “pieces” in Van-
couver, and gives the necessary instructions,
will find them awaiting him in his cabin
at Montreal. If they have to cross the
border to New York, he will have to claim
them in bond; but there will be no trouble
or delay, about that. Nor will there be if.
arriving at New York, he hands them over
for delivery at Vancouver. Or if lie lands
at Plymouth or Southampton, and decides
to see something of the glories of the South
of England before going on to London, or
if he lands at Liverpool and takes the oppor-
tunity of motoring to quaint old Chester and
perhaps making a detour of Wales before
seeing Westminster, he will have no difficulty
in arranging, before lie leaves the ship, for
his surplus luggage to await him at his
hotel or boarding-house in London.
THE ONE-CLASS.
The immigrant of earlier days would rub
his eyes if he could embark on one of the
fast, oil-burning one-class P. and O. steamers
which now run via Suez, affording quick,
pleasant transport at amazingly low rates.
While preserving the unrestricted range of
decks and saloons associated with the old
Branch service, the P. and O. has added per-
manent swimming baths, cinemas, attractive
and varied menus, one- and two-bertli cabins
and other refinements usually associated with
luxurious high-priced transport. The Aus-
tralian finds the unrestricted freedom of
broad decks, the rapid succession of pic-
turesque ports and the absence of distinction
between those at one end of the steamer
and those at the other admirably suited to
liis temperament. A feature of one-class
steamers is the type of traveller using them.
Men and women who formerly booked only
in first saloon are now finding unsuspected
enjoyment in the big vessels of the Branch
service . or the new Tourist Class of the
Royal Mail steamers.
THE BOGEY OF EXCHANGE.
The terrors of exchange have held many
people at home in Australia during the past
three years. But there are two sides even
to exchange. It is true that, your £125
in Australia will buy you only £lOO in Lon-
don ; but what will your £lOO buy ? In-
genious people have devised the “index num-
ber” to show us how much more or how
much less our pound will buy to-day than
it would yesterday; and they find that in
London what would have cost on the average
£lOO in 1927 could have been got for £SS
16s at the end of .Tunc of this year, and
still can be got for £62. Some easy figuring
will show you then that, even though you
pay £125 of your Australian money for £lOO
of English money, you will still find your
stay in England much less expensive than
you would have, done in, say, 1927; you
•will, in fact, get for your £125 what it
would have cost you about £lO2 to buy five
years ago.
And there is of course iio longer any need
for the traveller to take with him some of
the family plate in his trunk or to have a
few bales of wool stowed in the hold to pay
his expenses overseas. You might still find
it difficult to establish a credit for half a
million in London; but perhaps you will not
want to. If your demands are within reason
you will no longer have any difficulty on
that score.
But there are still two things you will
not do if you want to preserve your peace
of mind. One is to tender an Australian
note out of your own country. The other
is to patronise the money-changer who
haunts most foreign deep-sea wharves and
accept what he offers you without examining
every coin and every scrap of paper. Among
these peripatetic money-changers there
must be some who arc honest. But it is
safer to trust the purser of your own boat.
At least you will know where to find him
to-morrow.
TIPS AND TIPPING.
To the Australian tipping is one of the
perplexities of travel. Coming from a land
where it is very little the custom, he hesi-
tates to more or less furtively hand a man
a shilling for doing his regular job—it feels
too much like telling someone that he is an
inferior being, and that a great social gulf
is fixed between them. It takes him some
time to realise that if the servitor didn’t gel
tipped he wouldn’t have enough to live on,
in spite perhaps of his gorgeous livery.
When he does realise this, the Australian
is apt to err in liberality.
The old rule of the traveller was to dis-
burse 10 p.c. of the hill in tips. Later on
this had to be modified: 10 p.c. wasn't
enough for the waiter; it got to one shilling
for every six or seven shillings in the bill.
With a change in the times the swing, of
course, has been towards a smaller tip again.
Ten per cent, of the passage money is still
a very fair distribution among stewards —
cabin, dining-room, bath and deck: you can
cut it up according to the merits.
Incidentally, it is well to discover before-
hand whether deck chairs or lounges are
wanted for the voyage. Actually fewer and
fewer of these < are being taken aboard by
passengers: most companies now provide all
the seating and lounging accommodation
necessary. In some cases, however, the
chairs are hired out for the voyage. If this
is the rule, get into touch early with the
deck steward. He is a very handy person
to make friends with, anyway.
AMERICAN “TRAVEL CIRCLES.”
Taking him all round, the American is a
better tourist than the Briton. And that
is especially true of the wayback American
—the one who comes out of Main-street.
At the Trossaclis, in Sir Walter Scott’s
country, there was a group of eight or ten
Americans, all travelling together, all appar-
ently well acquainted with one another and
showing an amazing knowledge of the lakes
over which they had just been ferried, and
the country about them. They explained
it around" the fire that August evening.
They all came from one small —but. of
course, very wonderful —town in lowa.
Three years ago a meeting had been called
there to form a “travel circle”; they had
allowed themselves three years to save up.
to discuss and settle on an itinerary and
finally to study the literature and history
of the chosen route. They had had three
years of delightful anticipation; they were
having six months of delightful realisation :
they looked forward to a lifetime of pleasant
reflection. Meantime this one and that were
writing their impressions for the local paper,
which, in return for this service, would
make 20 proof “pulls” of each article, in
convenient lengths for binding; and there
the party would have a permanent record
of its grand tour —for many of them, no
doubt, the most wonderful thing in their
lives.

VIA AMERICA.
The “round trip” has become increasingly
popular—to Europe via America, and home,
via Suez or S. Africa : or vice versa. The
American route can be varied almost to
infinity; or, again, England can be reached
that way more quickly than by any other
route. Travellers have the option of three
trans-Paeific services:—
(1) Oceanic-Matson Line: Sailings every fourth
Saturday, with calls at Auckland, Suva, Pago Pago.
Honolulu, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
(2) Canadian-Australasian Line: Sailings every 28
days, calls at Auckland, Suva, Honolulu and Van-
couver.
(3) Union Line: Sailings every four weeks, calls
at Wellington, Rarotonga, Papeete and San Francisco.
At each port there is sufficient time for
passengers to make shore excursions. On
arrival at San Francisco or Vancouver pas-
sengers can travel across United States or
Canada to New York or Montreal, enjoying
liberal stop-over privileges cu route, and a
special increased free-baggage allowance.
To the average Australian, snow scenery
is fascinating; and the journey through' the
Rockies in Canada is in consequence very
popular. They manage these things well
in Canada: two through trains leave Van-
couver daily, one in the morning and the
other in the evening, and by changing from
one to the other, and stopping overnight
along the route, you can cover practically
the whole distance in daylight.
There can be plenty of snow, too, on the
other main route, through U.S.A.; and.
besides, there are the attractions that way
of Los Angeles, Hollywood, Yosemite, the
Grand Canyon, Salt Lake City and Chicago.
Either way you can take in Niagara. Or
you can go to Vancouver, do the Rockies,
come down to Toronto (Niagara is along-
side), and from there make through to New
York. _ Or you can go through from San
Francisco to New York, and then go by
way of the beautiful Hudson Valley to Mon-
treal and Quebec, and down the mighty St.
Lawrence into the Atlantic. Or, again, you
can travel from San Francisco to New
York by steamer, via Los Angeles, Panama
Canal and _ Havana. The Panama-Pacific
line maintains a regular fortnightly service
between San Francisco and New York with
new electric liners each of 20,000 gross tons,
the voyage from' coast to coast being accom-
plished in 16 days. The passage from San
Francisco down the Pacific coast to Panama
Canal is sheltered, with land in sight most
of the time; then comes a daylight journey
through Panama Canal before reaching
Havana, where the cigars come from.
There will be no difficulty about trans-
port across the Atlantic. You can pay
almost anything you please; you can get
luxury or you can get transport. The White
Star will offer you the Majestic or a whole
range of more inexpensive vessels, including
the Georgic and Britannic (27,000 tons)',
the largest British-built motor-vessels —and
very comfortable, too. For the convenience
of Australian passengers, allotments of
cabins are hold in Australia, and passengers
can select their accommodation from Now
York or Montreal to England before leaving
Sydney. The wise traveller makes all the
reservations he can well ahead.

THE CALL OF THE “OLD COUNTRY.”
The Australian tourist has one valuable
lesson to learn from his American cousin :
the advantage of planning the tour. It may
be that the American is apt to become the
slave to his plan; but by studying his route
and taking advice from the tourist agencies
and invoking their aid, he avoids that great
waste of time which bites deeply into many
an Australian’s holiday.
No tour in any country can be plotted
satisfactorily without knowing the tastes of
the tourist. There was a very knowledgable
little agency in Liverpool and Chester which
used to undertake to motor parties through
the North of England and Wales. It had
a list of questions which it asked its pros-
pective client to fill in before it began to
suggest a route. Thus : (1) Are you inter-
ested in ruins? (2) Are you interested in
churches? New or old? (3) Do you prefer
rugged or placid scenery? “Most Ameri-
can tourists are interested in ruins ; I have
never met an Australian who. was.” the
manager of the agency declared. There
was that fine old squatter from the Back
o’ Beyond, McTaggart, who used to drive
down to the nearest rail behind a pair of
riding camels. He was having a weary time
in London, whose shops and offices and
pavements bored him almost to tears. Once
he wandered down to Kensington Gardens
and met the little mob of sheep kept in the
park to graze it down. That day he was
the happiest man in London; and every
afternoon thereafter saw him getting better
acquainted with his new-found friends. In
a week he could have told if one was miss-
ing and which one it was. McTaggart had
made -the same mistake as thousands of
others —he had just drifted in without plans.
Yet. though no two people’s tastes are
exactly alike, for the sightseer who wants
to take in as much of Hie varied beauty of
Britain as possible, some general plans can.be
suggested. If he lands in London in early
spring he will find it best to go south and
busy himself there awhile. If the present
writer, horn and bred in Australia, were
asked to name those parts of rural Britain
which his countryman should see, he would
recommend Surrey and Kent, Somerset and
North Devon, the Valley of the Wye in
Wales, the Lakes district, the Scottish Lakes
and the Trossachs —this last a district which
may take- in-anything up to Oban. That
good and' cultured Australian. Timothy

Vo-ent-General, after tasting all the gems of
the Kingdom, returned again and again to
Somerset. “E ?<>u have seen Porlock at its
jipcf ”he said, “you have seen beauty. Ana
this’South Country holds more than beauty
of field and meadow, lull and moor. There
are so many quaint villages in England that
one would be brave to name tlie Quaintest,
but Clovelly will be in the competition—its
main street all steps and stairs with pan-
niered donkeys clattering up and down, at
the foot of it a jetty and an old stone wall
all overgrown with kiss-me-quick.
It is only an hour or two’s run into Corn-
wall- and the average Londoner will tell
you that if you have not seen the coast ot
Cornwall you have not seen England. But
to the Australian who knows the coastline
from, say, Nowra to Barrenjoey. the coast
of Cornwall —even the Cornish fishing vil-
lages so loved of the artists may not seem
so wonderful as the patchwork quilt of
Somerset.
The service car will take you almost
everywhere in England and Scotland; and
most dealers will sell you a car and repur-
chase it when your tour is over. _ But.
if you can make up a party, there is an-
other way of .seeing the Old Country. You
will have no difficulty in hiring cars driven
by men who know every lane and hedge ol
their own territory; after seeing Surrey and
Kent you can take train to the south-west
to pick up another who knows Somerset and
Devon; you can go north to Hereford or
Chester, and find another who will show
vou North Wales; from Keswick you can
tour the English Lakes; from Glasgow the
braes and glens and lochs of Scotland.
Crossing to Edinburgh you can see some-
thing of the superbly picturesque Scott
country; you can view fair Melrose by moon-
light. Catching train south you can break
your journey at York—very interesting _to
Australians because of its connection with
the wool industry as well as for its Min-
ster —and at Cambridge. This northern
journey you will probably take in August:
it is then you will see the heather at its
best.
But though you will have visited _ five of
Britain’s most attractive scenic districts,
there will still remain Oxford and Stratford-
on-Avon and Warwick and Windsor and a
hundred other places of surpassing interest
towards the Midlands but easily accessible
from London by train or service car. Ser-
vice cars make the run even between London
and Liverpool in a day ; but to most of us
that is not touring for pleasure.
The most leisurely tourist of all is the
enthusiast who is doing somebody’s “coun-
try.” Shakspeare and Sir Walter Scott draw
parties of Americans with their busy note-
books all through the spring and summer.
There is a constant stream to the English
Lakes; Ruskin still has many devotees.
Bunyan draws his pilgrims to the country
around Bedford. You remember when Chris
tian went towards Morality ho saw a hill
that overhung the way. The hill is there
still, beside the Ouse : and you can view the
ruins'of the “Stately Palace, beautiful to
behold,” which the interpreter showed to
Christian. It was Elstow Place, built by
Sir Thomas Hillersdon, and new in Bun-
yan’s youth. John Bunyan had a vivid
imagination; but he needed always some-
thing substantial to build upon. There had
to be Chiltern Hills before there could be
Delectable Mountains.
All Britain is full of intriguing associa-
tions and romantic stories. If it is not
Shakspeare or Walter Scott or Southey and
his poet friends or John Bunyan, it is some-
body else. Your tour is a succession of
surprises—as when you thread your way
through the narrow winding principal street
of Totnes, on the borders of Cornwall and
Devon and find a monument to Wills, of
Burke and Wills, the Australian explorers.
REBORN CEYLON.
More and more the Australian who can-
not afford the time or money to go further
afield looks to Ceylon: the ships of the P.
and O. and Orient lines are at his service
for this excursion, and he can see some-
thing of Asia and the wonders of the Orient
without suffering any discomforts whatever.
On Colombo the ships of the P. and O.
converge from north and east and west.
Almost side by side with the uncovered
grandeur of the “buried cities” of Ceylon
are superlatively fine golf links. Eight-
cylinder cars flash past prehistoric bullock
transport. Tourists flip cigarette-butts into
the placid waters which surround the site
of the private prison for wives of Kandyan
kings. The sacred Bo tree, 2200 years old,
rises amid jungle growth born yesterday.
The weird incongruities which add to the
fascinations of Ceylon are illustrated also
in the polyglot population, a tide of many
hues which surges through Colombo. Mild
Cingalese, descendants of the Indian con-
queror of the sixth century 8.C., are marked
by vivid loin-cloths and tortoiseshell combs
with upstanding sharp-edged fringes. Yel-
low-gowned devotees of Buddha, gaily-
dressed Hindus, giant Afghans in baggy
trousers and gay waistcoats, Malays, Par-
sees, Portuguese and a. score of other races
jostle leisurely as they pass.
Towering over modernity is Adam’s Peak,
wrapped in mists, legendary and real. You
can climb the iron ladder to its crest and
wonder what secret Alexander the Great
had which would preserve iron* from his day
to ours. Rival religions claim the.gigantic,
footprint discernible by the devout. Six
hundred years before Christ Buddha is said
to have stepped on to the crest aiid left
his; print. Moslem tradition recalls that
Adam,-driven from Paradise, expiated his fault
by standing-on one foot upon the peak until
Gabriel’forgave him and bestowed Ceylon
upon Adam' and Eve. The Hindus proclaim
-the\footprint as that of the all-powerful god
Siva.
Anuradhapura, tlie more easily visited of
the buried cities, was built more than 25
centuries ago, was larger than modern Lon-
don, had streets 16 miles long and temples
and palaces with golden pinnacles. Its
Brazen Temple, of which 16M0 .pillars sur-
vive, was a magnificent masterpiece of 1009
rooms. It was nine storeys high. A central
throne of ivory had a sun in gold, a moon
in silver and stars in rich pearls. Needless
to say sun, moon and stars have long since
vanished!
Many of the precious gems of Ceylon—
sapphires, rubies, topazes, amethysts, garnets
—are found in alluvial valleys, and the pro-
cess of “mining” for them is infinitely older
than the days of Solomon. Pits aye dug
and the earth sieved through basket ware,
water facilitating the process. The art of
cutting and polishing precious stones has
been handed down from father to son
through several generations.
Visitors can find absorbing hours watching
the tea-picking and the rubber-tapping, the.
husbandry, crafts and fishing, and the other
occupations which keep the island populous.

East —our Far North —are seen through a

excursion, rates, and tlie tempting oppor
tunity to “make your steamer your hotel
the E. and A. Co.’s slogan —enormously add
to the lure of the Orient. lioWil
Holiday seekers eager to visit Rabaui,
Manila, Hongkong, Shanghai and Japanese
ports arc filling the comfortable .Biitish
steamers which travel by the smooth-watei
route to Yokohama. Liners are crowded at
the height of the season, but every season
<>f the year has its own charm m China
and Japan, and many Australians pie or
Japan in the beauty of the autumn or the
snowy freshness of her winter.
Not least of the privileges of an L. ana
A. pleasure-jaunt to Japan is the scenic trip
to Cairns, with tropical beauty on the t
and the wonderful Barrier Reef on the
l ight. Then follows the historically interest-
ing and always attractive port of Rabaui,
where Australia’s naval and military expedi-
tionary force made history in the opening
hours of the Great War. After that there
is a smooth-water run to Manila. The capital
of the Philippines never palls on its guests.
The remarkable mingling of ancient and
modern civilisations, the contrasts between
modern Americans, old-type Spaniards, and
native Filipinos, and the score of beauty
spots enthral Australians. Follow Hong-
kong, the great seaport of the Far Last,
with its glorious semicircle of harbor, filled
with the intriguing moving life of junk and
sampan; and Shanghai, the immense 3 reaty
Port, and sometime storm centre, where
Australians can see the real China, with
safety, and find absorbing interest in the
thousand and one opportunities in silks and
china and quaint curios. Japan and its
Inland Sea open out like a wonderful
volume, each port a page, each hour a para-
graph. Australians can join one of the over-
land excusions and enter the heart of Japan
in the care of expert guides and at small
cost. Or they can use their steamer as a
floating base without cost and plan all-day
excursions therefrom, returning nightly to
the cool comfort and broad decks of their
ocean home. The Japanese are perfect in
their mastery of tourist detail. No trifle
is neglected and no attraction unexploited.
THE WORLD-CRUISING CARINTHIA.
r Phe Carinthia will sail from New York on
January 7, 1933, on a world cruise, cover-
ing a new Southern Hemisphere route. The
vessel, the newest of Cunarders, was speci-
ally built for this work.
Australians can embark at Sydney on
February 28, and proceed to any of the
following countries, or continue for the
remainder of the cruise, and thence _ on to
England. After leaving Sydney she will pro-
ceed to New Guinea, the Dutch East Indies,
including Bali and Java, the Straits Settle-
ments and Ceylon. Then a stop for the
first time in the history of any cruise will
be made at the Seychelle Islands; thence
she will cruise down the coast of East
Africa from Mombasa to Cape Town, across
the South Atlantic to Monte Video, Buenos
Ayres, Santos, Rio de Janeiro and Barbadoes,
and continue to New York. The Carinthia
is a sister to the Franconia, the famous
Ounard world-tourer, and is designed for
precisely such a cruise as the one she will
make in 1933. With her punkadouvre system
of ventilation she is cool even in thei tropics.
She has already made two visits to Aus-
tralia, but this is the first time Australians
have had an opportunity of booking for a
Carinthia cruise.
The charges are notably moderate, especi-
ally in view of the fact that from beginning
to end passengers will make the ship their
hotel.
THE MAORI PLAYGROUND.
The Navigation Act put a stop to the
once-popular “apple trip” from Sydney via
Hobart to Melbourne or Adelaide; even the
ships running between Australian ports and
Java, China and Japan may not, except
under special dispensation, carry a passenger
between Australian ports. But New Zea-
land is outside the Act, so all three lines
trading between Australia and America will
ferry passengers across the Tasman Sea.
In addition there are the Union and Hud-
dart Parker services.
For the convenience of Australians and
oversea visitors to Australia, the N.Z. Gov-
ernment has set up tourist agencies in the
principal cities of the Commonwealth; and
itineraries arc prepared to suit all tastes
and pockets. The Rotorua thermal region
is, of course, the great attraction: no other
country in the world can offer the same
remarkable series of thrills. For those who
want to know what English and Scottish
scenery is like, but cannot afford it may
be the time or it may be the money to go
so far afield, a tour of the South' Island can
be recommended. From Christchurch south
vou will find a succession of villages that
are English until they become Scottish; then
turning inland from Dunedin or Invercargill
(altogether Scottish except for the difficulty
of finding a hotel with a gill or two o’
whisky in it) you reach what Maorilanders
call the Cold Lakes to distinguish them from
the Hot Lakes of the North Island. But
if you have difficulty in raising whisky at
Invercargill you will have none about get-
ting some of the finest oysters in the world;
and alongside, at Manapouri, southernmost
of the great lakes, you may catch you:
breakfast of whitebait and find as magni-
ficent a herd of wild deer as any country
in Europe could show you.
AUSTRALIAN SEAWAYS.
Australia is a sea-girt, continent which
offers to its people an extraordinarily wide
variety of coastal scenery. In the winter,
when the southern States are chilled, the
call to the sunny North is most insistent.
Day after day a warm sun gleams from a
cloudless sky on 'the sparkling waters of
the coast of Queensland. • The still air en-
hances the beauties and sharpens the out-
lines of shore and island. The green tracery
of the palms, backed by the blue of the
distant hills, the golden beaches washed by
the waters, of a coral sea have an appeal
and charm that live in the memory.
Who can deny the witchery of the Whit-
sunday Passage or the magnificence of the
fiord-like Hinchinbrook Channel? The
generous warmth, the sparkling air, and the
continual delight, of days _ spent amid
nature’s most glorious handiwork quicken
the blood and bring a zest to life.
When the hot blasts of summer scorch
city streets and dust and heat become un-
bearable, when nerves are frayed and humid
days sap the energy, again comes the call
to the seaways of Australia. Out into Bass
Strait and the long green stretches of the
Bight lies the path to the West, where,
following the sunset, the ships pass onward
to the cool horizon. From the depths of
the frozen south come the cooling breezes
that make the days spent at sea one long
delight. And at the journey’s end Aus-
tralia has again a prize to offer: Perth and
the beautiful winding reaches of the Swan,
with its timbered hillsides and sheltered
waters.
The Inter-State Coastal Services provide
the means of making luxurious and comfort-
able cruises, in modern, well-equipped vessels,
at economical rates.
B.P.
We have talked of the romance that sur-
rounds some of the great shipping companies
of the Atlantic; but we can also iind it
much nearer home. To thousands of Pacific
islanders “Beepy” is some great, dimly-
visioned potentate, half-trader multiplied a
million times and half-“medicine man,” who
says what shall be paid for all that man
grows and can sell and for all that man
can want to buy; who sends ships that swal-
low more bags of copra than anybody could
ever count and gives up endless stores of
more things than all the world could pos-
sibly every use. To whites and natives
alike of scores of the islands of the South
Pacific, Burns, Philp and Co. is “Beepy”
—B.P. —the one link with the outer world ;
to many of them, indeed, “Beepy” is the
outer world.
Yet the beginning of it all was far enough
away from the coral isles. Young James
Burns had been jackerooing on a Queens-
land station, where he had had charge, too,
of the store, when the Gympie goldfield was
discovered —that was in 1867. He had
given up station life and was joining his
brother in a store in Brisbane; but he
decided that here was a bigger chance. H’e
took it and his native shrewdness and energy
did the rest. Next, Charters Towers was
discovered; Burns set himself up at its port
of Townsville, and “got it coming and going.”
But he had begun to see much further afield.
(“What do you think the most important
quality in a business man?” The Bulle-
tin’s “Wild Cat” once asked him. “I don’t
know,” he said, “what is the most important,
but I do know that he cannot go very far
without imagination.”) So he moved to
Sydney, leaving liis friend Robert Philp to
look after the firm’s interests in Queensland;
and in 1883 B.P. and Co. was registered as
a company in Sydney. A modest little eo.
it was; nowadays it has itself a capital of
nearly a million and a half, and out of it
has sprung the great Queensland Insurance
Co. and a dozen other companies. And not.
only do its steamers ply to the islands of
Polynesia, but a most important trade is
done with Java and other islands of the
East Indies and Singapore.
Its own special field is still, nevertheless,
the islands of the Pacific; to these B.P. intro-
duces an endless stream of Australian and
overseas tourists. Most attractive of its
tours is that wdiich takes in the Solomon
Islands: the Mataram, formerly on the Java-
Singapore service, makes this trip every six
weeks, the voyage itself occupying about a
month.
ACROSS THE CHANNEL
That is one advantage which the Eng-
lish at home have: in a long week-end they
can do quite a lot of foreign travel; for
the Channel crossing is only a matter of
minutes.
But the Australian abroad will have more
than a long week-end to spare for the couple
of visits to the Continent which he ought
to make, assuming that he proposes to spend,
say, nine months away from home. Let us
suppose that lie has landed in England in
May, has “done” the Kingdom, winding up
with Scotland in August, and is now free for
four weeks, what shall we do with him?
Some advisers will say: “Wait awhile; then
go south and pick up your boat homeward-
bound at Marseilles (P. and O.) or Toulon
or Naples (Orient).” If possible, however,
it will be better to make two bites at the
Continental cherry; take the north in Sep-
tember, leaving the south till December,
when you can also look in on some of the
winter sports; Holland and Belgium and
France, as many a Digger knows, are not
quite like an Australian beach on Christ-
mas Day and thereabouts.
With four weeks, then, to spend in Sep-
tember let us take what many people think
is a model tour, and the itinerary (Cook’s
were responsible _ for this particular one)
will show two things especially: how much
ground it is possible to very comfortably
cover on the European Continent in a limited

it for travellers :

Sept. 15. Interlaken. Unaccompanied excursion
to Schiedegg and Grindelwald; dep. 10.45 (time-
table herewith). Luncheon at Buffet de la Gare,

paid; pay 1.25 fr.)
Sept. 16. Interlaken. Free. (If weather inter-
fered with excursion on 15th, use tickets and
vouchers to-day.)
And so on from Interlaken to Montreux,
from which excursions are made to Lausanne
and Geneva; then on September 22 from
Montreux to Paris, meeting the French
Customs at Vallorbe, arriving at Paris at
22.18, the journey from Montreux occupying
about 85 hours. Six days are spent in Paris;
and on September 29 we leave via Calais and
Dover for London. The journey from Paris
to Calais takes 3 hours 15 minutes; for the
crossing lhr. 20min. is allowed; and, in-
cluding all time spent in transfers, London
is reached in 7hr. 15min. It will be noticed
that throughout the 24-hour system is used.
Midnight is zero; midday is 12.00; 9.30
p.m. is 21.30. There are no a.m.’s or p.m.’s.
Thus in four weeks we have had three days
in Belgium and seen a good deal of Holland;
we have visited Cologne, one of the most
beautiful cities of Germany, and gone up
the storied Rhine from that city to Mayence;
we have spent 11 glorious days in Switzer-
land and six in Paris ; and we are back in
London on the 27th day.
Later on, when winter has settled down
on London, you should make south again.
Two routes may be taken—through Ger-
many or through Paris and Marseilles. If
you are coming home by P. and O. and
catching the boat at Marseilles you wall
probably go south through Germany, com-
ing down to Venice, going as far south in
Italy as your fancy or your pocket dictates,
coming back northward through Florence
and Milan, maybe turning north into
southern Switzerland for winter sports,
then along the Mediterranean to San Remo,
and Monte Carlo, and Nice, and so on to
Marseilles. If you come by Orient, you may
prefer to take the journey south by w r ay
of Paris and Marseilles, thence to Nice
(where you will certainly wrnnt to stay
awhile), then to Milan, from which either
Switzerland or the glories of Italy or both
lie open before you on your way to join
your steamer at Naples.
ACROSS CANADA.
The fine ships of the Canadian-Australian
line land you at Victoria or Vancouver
after you have called in at Auckland, Fiji
and Honolulu. Coming up to Vancouver you
will have abundant opportunity of making
your train, hotel and Atlantic reservations
if that important job has not already been
attended to; and, landing, you will make
acquaintance with a feature of foreign travel
that is unknown to Australians —-the railway
hotel. At every important terminus and at
most resorts of the long-distance tourist the
great C.S.R. Co. (Canadian Pacific Railway
Co.) has built palatial hotels, most of them,
of course, open all the year l’ound, a few
of them, in the-Rockies, opening only when
the first touch of spring makes some of these
tourist tracks passable. Here at Van-
couver, too, the Australian visitor will pro-
bably get his first real taste of salmon ; lie
will have sampled it no doubt on the ship,
but now he will learn how much of the
flavor is lost in two or three months on the
ice. Wandering around he may make his
first acquaintance also with the squirrel;
and, if he can make a trip up the gulf, he
will begin to learn what the lumber trade
means to Canada: in quiet bays he will find
rafts of logs as extensive almost as a
Riverina farm.
Leaving -Vancouver by one of the fine cross-
continent trains of the C.P.R. he will become
acquainted with the sleeping-car system of
America. He will probably have been told
that he (or she) will occupy one of a long
procession of blinks made up and down the
open car, that he (or she) will have to
undress and dress in the corridor, and much
more to the same alarming effect. Even if.
for economy's sake, he (or she) takes one
of these pullman berths, he (oi% again, she)
may find it very disappointing, for behind
the heavy curtain one may wriggle in and
out of his (or her) garments with more
seclusion than one can get in most seaside
boarding-houses. But, if one wants still
greater seclusion and no doubt more com-
fort, one can have either a “compartment"
or a “parlor”—neither of them so much
extra in price as they sound. One greatly-
appreciated advantage these compartments
give the Australian: he can regulate the
temperature to his own liking. Used though
the Canadian may be to ice and snow, he
will generally, when indoors, even in a
train, ask for heat which the Australian,
as a rule, finds insufferable.
“Stopping off” at Sicamous, at the end
of the first day, you will be fresher for the
second day, which will take you into the
heart of the Rockies, through endless pine
forests; eternally ice-clad peaks in every
direction; cliff-faces scarred and highly-
colored (pray that the Fates are kind and
send you a fine sunset) ; if snow has fallen
lately, as it probably will have done, a
million glittering Christmas-trees on either
side of you. And so to Banff, the centre of
the great wild-animal reserve in the Rockies,
where you will stop-over for a few days,
and, if the season is open, visit Lake Louise
and other dream-places. And you will
wander around and see Banff’s little zoo, and
learn what polar bears and other furred
animals can look like in their homes. Maybe,
as you go on, the train will halt to give you
a close-up of a great, brown bear which has
learned to lope down to the track and pick
up a few dainties, though you wall be
warned beforehand to keep to your cars.
So out on to the prairies, through appar-
ently endless miles of farm-land without

TASMANIA.
Fqr those mainland holiday-makers who
must be in quick call of home, or to whom
(lays—and pounds, too —are precious, Tas-
mania’s attractions make a strong appeal.
(Specially in summertime. Here you can
find something of Kent and Surrey and of
Devon; here are trout-streams and apples
and cider and rosy-cheeked maids, and.
mingled with sylvan grace and beauty, as
wild and picturesque scenery as yon could
find anywhere. From Sydney a 14 days'
holiday can be had for £l9, everything
inclusive.
THE LOGBOOK.
For illumination in Nelson’s day they
burned tallow dips. Later on oil lamps were
used. The first electric! lights to be installed
aboard a ship were fitted in the Servia
when she was launched in 1881. She was a
Cunarder.
The first ocean-going steamers were wooden
side-wheelers; most of them had sails. The
China was the first single-screw steamer on
the Atlantic; she was launched in 1862.
The first wireless on board an ocean-going
ship was installed on the Lucania in October,
1908. In these days not only does every
passenger ship have its wireless, but most
of them have their daily newspaper, largely
wireless news.
The Berengaria, the flagship of the
Gunard fleet, 52,226 tons, was the first vessel
to be equipped with a permanent standard
talkie equipment. Many vessels have
motion-picture equipment.
The co. which owns the Cunard line also
owns the Anchor and Anchor-Donaldson
lines, and the Commonwealth and Dominion
line. The latter alone has 25 ships sailing
between England and Australia. The co.
owns in all a million lons of shipping.
Thomas Cook, the man who founded
Cook’s, was born in Melbourne; but Cook’s
Melbourne is in Derbyshire, not Victoria.
Ilis first venture was an excursion train
trip of 12 miles, between Leicester and
Loughborough; return fare, Is. This was
in 1841. After that he organised other ex-
cursions for different societies, and in 1845
set; up in the business. Ten years later,
after arranging excursions to the Paris
Exhibition, he extended to foreign travel.
The biggest job Cook’s ever did was when
they were called on to transport Wolseley’s
troops for the relief of Cordon in Khartoum.
It was a rush job—to carry 18,000 troops
and 40,000 tons of stores and ammunition
up the Nile—and it called for 27 steamers,
650 sailing boats, 800 rowing boats and
15.000 railway trucks.
The Orient Co. took its name from a
sailing ship which Anderson, Anderson and
Co. chartered for the trade between Eng-
land and 8. Australia. Later there was an
Orient steamer, also chartered.
The modern passenger ship has a swim-
ming bath and the use of fresh water in
staterooms and baths is not stinted. The
early immigrant ships generally limited
their passengers to three quarts per person
per day—and there wasn’t always that.
(And when there was, often nobody with a
nose wanted to use it.) To-day the most
modern liners have water filters —usually
beds of sand, which are completely turned
over and washed mechanically at periodic
intervals. A Belfast co. holds the patent.
The Majestic’s swimming bath can be
filled with 120 tons of warmed sea water in
25 minutes.
Speeds of the “best boats” have moved
Ibis way: Early ’seventies, 12-14 knots;
mid-’seventies, 14-15: ’ri*rbt i ''«*.
’nineties, JLG-1S; mid-’nineties, 20. Since
then, though boats like the Majestic do 2.1
knots, more attention has been given to
comfort than to speed. Boats like the
Olympic (46,489 tons) and Homeric (34,351
tons) don’t seek an average of more than
19-20 knots.
Probably the first ship that ever used
steam to cross an ocean was the Curacao,
built at Dover (Eng.), but bought by the
1 Mitch Navy in 1826. On the outward
voyage to Surinam she steamed 12 days out
<>f 28 and on the homeward 21 days out of
29. For the rest of the time she used her
sails.
America has at least one travel school.
Year by year for more than seven years
past Mites Helen L. Stout has had a staff:
of teachers taking the daughters of rich
Americans to Europe to “finish off.” The
girls, mostly of 18 or 19, spend the morn-
ings in the study of history, literature and
languages, in the afternoon they “broaden
their minds” with chosen sight-seeing (art
galleries, etc.), and in the evenings they
mostly go to operas or concerts.
Some old-time records: The Lusitania, o“
the Orient line, arrived at Adelaide from
England, via the Cape, in 40 days 6£hr..
inclusive of a detention of 1 day 7h'r. at
St. Vincent (Aug. 8, 1877). The Aconcagua
same fine, made the passage from Plymouth
to Adelaide in 39 days 20hr. steaming (.Tub
2. 1878). The P. and O. Siam, coming via
Brindisi, delivered mails from London dated
Oct. 26 in Melbourne on Dec. 3, 1877: she
was only 34 days 22hr. at sea. The follow
iug year she delivered mails in 36 days.
Where did the word “clipper” come from
as applied to ships? Holland, in “Historic
Ships,” says during the war of 1812 some
schooners and brigs of Chesapeake Bay were
called “Baltimore clippers” because of their
speed. They were long, low vessels, so fast
that they were in great request as priva-
teers. Twenty years later the Ann McKim.
493 tons, was built at Baltimore on the
same lines ; she was the first of the regular
ocean-going clippers.

ANOTHER FRIENDSHIP RUINED.
I was discussing the causes of the depres-

the game on such occasions.
“If only we had a high tariff wall,” I
explained, “we could raise the cost of pro-
duction in accord-
ance with Gloo-
ber's law in re the
cost of living.
That would soon
result in the over-
seas market fall-
ing and the banks

sullenly.
“But,” I resum-

Whereas, if we
strengthen our sec-
ondary industries
with a fiduciary
issue, further un-
employment will
be impossible, and the exchange rate in the
countries which are still on gold will im-
prove. Do you see that?”
“No,” he replied, “I can’t grasp it, and

ing the same as you did.”

The new railway from Tommy’s Flat to
Gumbawoop was completed, and the first
train, with engine gaily beflagged, was about
to depart. The township was en fete. The
Mayor, Aid. Egghead, had referred to the
“hepoch-making lievent” which would open
up “ ’ithertb hinhaccessible tracks of coun-
try,” and had stressed tvhat a boon it would
be to the 17 residents along the route. But
it was left to the member for the district
to petrify the audience with the intimation
that history had been made of which- the
district might well be proud, in that the
actual cost of the line had only exceeded
the estimated sum by a quarter of a million
sterling!

Most of us know about such first-magni-

everybody doesn’t know, however, is that
this is the reason why one of the most
famous of them is known as the Great Bare.
Stars are divided for ordinary purposes
into lucky stars, shooting stars, star bar-
gains, double stars and three star. Leading
astronomers also have a theory that an
Orion’s belt in the solar plexus will pro-
duce another kind of star.
The Milky Whey or Galactic Circle (from
the Greek laetis, a cow-cocky) extends
down the coast of New South Wales and
through Gippsland, in Victoria. Here are
to be found many earnest students of astro-
nomy. They get up at three o’clock in the
morning to study the stars, and continue
working till the stars appear again.
An ideal place to study the stars is on a
picnic boat. I shall never forget the girl I
taught astronomy to on one. She had a

•
“Autumn Crocus," planted and tended by
a competent company at Melbourne Kings
on Saturday, differs from its innumerable
predecessors on the same theme in the sin-
cerity of the playwright’s characterisations.
Miss C. L. Anthony got the raw material
during trips to the European Continent as
buyer of toys for a London store. She has
observed her people sharply and well. Where
other playwrights have been content to trot
out the old stereotypes, tit them into a plot
and supply them with synthetic humor, she
treats them realistically, not as caricatures.
The play is leisurely in places, but only
ton leisurely for audiences whose demand for
a laugh or a cry a minute has been too much
catered for by dramatists with more greed
than honesty. The leading figure in the
production at the King’s is Tlieo Shall, an
Austrian who speaks English fluently hut
with an accent appropriate to the role, lie
has been advertised as the matinee idol or
Vienna and an ex-enemy flying ace. The
Firm might have told the public that he is
an artist as well. Perhaps it forgot or
didn’t think that mattered. A graceful lover
Shall never makes the spectacle of a baffled
Englishwoman succumbing in a day to the
strange, terrifying and exotic charm of a
foreign innkeeper seem incongruous. He
will raise her off her feet, make her happy.
He believes it, she believes it:, you believe it.
The whole thing may, be romantic delusion,
but romantic delusion is a part of life and
therefore legitimate subject-matter for a
play. Dorothy Peters is an artist, too. Her
demure and wistful entry into the first act
in a brown skirt and coat and woeful spec-
tacles is an unpromising beginning for a
leading lady whose job is to capture the
front stalls, but in the next act Miss Peters
is in a Tyrolean shawl, lent by her inn-
keeper lover, and her awakening to life is
as natural as possible ; as is her resumption
of the brown coat and skirt and the woeful
spectacles in the final scene. In an extremel y
well-ordered background arc several examples
of good portraiture. Mona Barlee and
Campbell Oopelin are a pair of mortals en-
gaged in tlie experiment of companionate
marriage for the purpose of studying each
other’s reactions and comparing them with
the textbooks on psychology. His recent
adventure in an aeroplane has not impaired
Copelin’s histrionic sense, and Miss Barlee
does not overdo the modern girl; she remains
a human being in a Situation where the
temptation lo exaggerate _ is strong. .An
augury of improved relations between cx-
enemies is the appearance of Harry Wotton
as the lovable, sentimental German of the
'eighties. Ten years ago he would have been
tolerable only as a villain. As his stout,
adoring wife with only a few words of Ger-
man to say, Katie Towers is excellent.
Dorothy Dunckling overstates the case
against Mother Grundy as Miss Peters’s
travelling companion early in the piece. An
engaging show.

Exactly what G. B. Shaw was driving at
in “Captain Brassbound’s -Conversion,” the
third of the Thorndike co.’s productions at
Sydney Boyal. is doubtless explained very
minutely in the preface, but Shaw's pre-
faces are soon forgotten. Whatever the argu-
ment was it hasn’t convinced the world that
judges are persons who are “paid £5000 a
year to be wicked,” or that their judicial im-
partiality is seriously impaired by allowing
them to own property. Neither has it made
popular the view that Christians are people
who believe they will go to Heaven if they
give all their possessions to the poor.
Though the lines expressing such notions
still raise a titter when expressed with, the
artlessness which is the charm of Dame
Thorndike’s art, the strongest applause goes
to the epigrams which Shaw manufactured
out of well-worn platitudes.
The character of Lady Cicely Waynflete,
whose boundless confidence in the inherent
benevolence of human nature carried her
through darkest Africa alone and unscathed,
remains, however, first-class theatrical
material. It presents the paradox of the clever
idiot, always effective when neatly done.
Captain Brassbound’s romanticism was bound
to be exploded by the first attempt at com-
monsensc analysis, and Shaw makes a nice,
job of the explosion.
The interest of the latest Sydney produc-
tion centred, of course, more in Dame Thorn-
dike than in Shaw. She and Lewis Casson
received Very little support from a cast that
was probably picked for “Saint Joan” and
is not remarkable for versatility. Michael
Martin-HarVey’s Scotch missionary and the
American sailors impersonated by Albert
< ’hevalier and Christopher Casson were
lamentably deficient in accent, and Norman
Shelley’s impersonation of the Cockney Felix
Drinkwater had not even a flavor of reality.
The production reached a high level, his-
trionically, only in the last five minutes,
when Rrassbound and Lady Cicely had the
stage to themselves, and created an illusion
<;f sex hypnotism that was entirely success-
in]. The breaking of. the spell and the end-
1|'g of the play upon that instant counts
'do marks to Shaw as a playwright.
“Hello Happiness!” Frank Neil’s new
revue at Sydney Cri.. is as colorful and
hilarious as its predecessor, “Pleasure
Round.” George Wallace and Ell a Shields
nre the twin stars, and they twinkle bravely,
"he settings are a bright lesson in geo-
graphy.

Melbourne Princess was reopened last
for flic dreadful purpose 0 f presenting
1 he Girl Who Helped Ned Kelly,” by
Charles E. Taylor. Taylor’s Ned is the mild-
est sinner who ever raised his hand against a
fellow-man. If the Girl had helped him to
i 1 m "g of tea and a Sunday-school picnic
bun at the final curtain it would have been
;i htfmg end to a pious career. His hatred
ot bloodshed amounts to an obsession, and
he delivers a sermon on the uselessness of
violence to his gang every time an unruly
member blows a trooper’s head off. This
happens fairly frequently, for “The Girl”
belongs to the class of bushranging melo-
drama wherein a diffuse and inconsequen-
tial dialogue has to be punctuated liberally
by pistol shots in order to keep the minds
of the audience from wandering off.
The staging and the performance are gen-
erally good, though the wistful gentleness
of the police seems somewhat out of place.
Rutland Beckett has the task of making
himself heard through the Kelly whiskers,
for which the back of a large black sheep
lias been rifled of its crop. Iza Crossley
looks attractive as the Girl, and drifts in
and out of the plot driven by sighs and set
all aback by passion; but in the absence of
precise details as to her relations with the
outlaw she lacks sailing directions and fails
to reach the port of Sex Appeal. Thelma
Scott makes a fiery Kate Kelly. Fred Mac-
donald is Steve Hart, bothered by night-
mare visits of the troopers he has helped
to kill. D’Arcy Kelway provides an inter-
lude of good but irrelevant comedy as a
friend of the gang, and Avith a medical dic-
tionary in which he finds a surprising num-
ber of lvis own complaints.

Melbourne playAvriglits have a passion for
more or less polite English draw'ing-room
comedy. The impression conveyed by most
local examples of the art is that the authors
got their ideas about the British aristocracy
from back numbers of the “Tatler” in den-
tists’ waiting-rooms. The performers usually
appear to have acquired their knowledge of
how English lords and ladies behave from
even less reliable
sources. The result-
ant production is as
much like the reality
as a performance of
the “Medea” by Mo
and co. The above
reflections are pro-
moted by the pro-
duction of J. R
Lester’s “Just a
Minute” at the Kel-
vin Hall. The most
arresting thing about
the story of the
society woman who
endeaxmred to re-
awaken the interest
of her husband by
inventing a 1o v <
affair was the skill
with which Max Nich-
olson kept a monocle
in his eye. Mr.
Lester has revived
that fine old English
institution the Sliaks-
pearean soliloquy,
which turned the
performance into a
series of solo elocu-
tionary exhibits. W.
G. South well and
Jean Campbell came
off best.

The audience,
crammed to' the
doors of Melb. Town
H a 11, went mad
when Szigeti smash-
ed out the last bars
of the last move-
ment in a programme
of three concertos
last week. It was a
tribute to an
achievement unequal-
led in Yarraside
musical' history ex-
cept by the Back-
baus concerts and
the Bach Festival
Week. Soloists have
appeared in one con-
certo often and occa-
sionally in two, but
Szigeti and the Uni-
versity Symphony
Orchestra were the
first combination to
do the hat-trick by
bowling Bach, Beet-
hoven and Brahms
with successive balls.
Au unusual fea-
tore was the perfect liaison between the
violinist and the orchestra, which, by
the end of the evening, left the impression,
though without offence, that Prof. Bernard
Ileinze Avas on the conductor’s rostrum as an
interested spectator of a touching family
reunion—papa Szigeti with his adoring
children on his knee. Just before his proper
entry into the Beethoven work the tall Hun-
garian unostentatiously gave the cue to the
first violins by joining them in a phrase, and
later he dropped some invaluable hints to
the second violins. The result of this colla-
boration AA r as an e\ r ening of beautiful music.
A true friend is one who buys a ticket
from a flapper who has joined an am. dram,
soc., goes to the show, and applauds wildly
her entrances and exits, though her lines be
scant. Sydney’s latest bunch of mummers-
for-the-love-of-it, the Units, gave their first
performance last week, producing two one-
acters. “The Dear Departed” and “Rest
Cure.” The Units have some true friends,
and they’ll need ’em.

Shadow Shows.
“The Washington Masquerade,” at Sydney
State, is a great show of its rip-roaring kind.
Lionel Barrymore, who is a poor but honest
rural lawyer when the action starts, fights
his way to Washington as a Senator in face
of capitalistic opposition. Panic-stricken by
his orations regarding the downtrodden
masses the minions of wealth sool Karen
Morley on to him. He marries her, and at
her instigation accepts a dummy job at a
big salary. And now the Senate smells a
rat and starts the equivalent of a tin-hare
commission. At about the same time the ex-
upheavalist smells a rat also, and volunteers
some evidence which undoes his undoers.
It is a magnificent production technically,
and Barrymore has a great part, one which
is ideally adapted to his age, voice and
mannerisms.
* #
“Life Goes On,” at the Plaza, is a
masterly thriller played by a fine all-English
cast. Hugh Wakefield arrives at a London
hotel in search of relaxation —preferably in
feminine company—and finds a dead body.
Betty Stockfield, as a financier’s wife who
had an assignation with the dead man, the
latter’s secretary, the hotel manager, a
blackmailer and his mistress are mixed up
in the business, and rnost of the excitement
surges round a girl in the hotel telephone
exchange who has taken a fancy to Wake-
field on sight. Like most first-class com-
edians, Wakefield is always the same, but
he has an unusually good part in this show.
His articulation must be as near perfection
as it is possible for English speech to be.
“Women Who Play,” with an English cast
and producer, is a much poorer job. Times
have changed since Lonsdale wrote it for
the stage as “Spring Cleaning,” and the
central idea is out of date. Modern de-
cadents wouldn’t leave a dinner-party in the
scandalised manner of vicarage-haunters be-
cause their host invited “a woman of easy
virtue,” as the programme calls Mary New-
comb. After the first shock of surprise the
unexpectedness of the stunt coming from
a prosy moralist like the hero ■would almost
certainly have delighted them and caused
them to take the lady to their bosoms. The
lengthy homilies which George Barraud, as
“CAPTAIN BRASSBOUND’S CONVERSION

(Top to bottom, left to right): Michael Mar tin-Harvey -thinly

an ambassador’s togs by Lady Cicely.
the wronged husband, inflicts on everybody,
particularly his wife, aren’t suited to
the screen. Or it may be that it takes an
actor as magnetic as one of the Barrymores
to put them across. Anyhow, the Plaza
audience didn’t seem impressed on Satur-
day night, and there was a steady stream
of departures after the first half-hour.
Benita Hume as the wife, Barry Jones as
her admirer, and Gerald Lyly as a modern
equivalent of the Roman beauty-boy stand
out.
* * *
“Mr. Bill the Conqueror,” at Sydney
Prince Edward, is another setback for those
who want to see English films by English
producers do well. Its best features are the
pretty pictures of old-world villages, inns
and farmhouses. The plot is the one about
the young man of fashion who loses his
money, and makes good by honest toil; on
this occasion he turns farmer. It reeks of
old stage conventions. The heavy father who
forbids the hero the house; his daughter,
the modest domestic drudge, who looks like
a mannequin in a print frock; the low-
comedy yokels and village gossips; the fleer-
ing female aristocrat out of the hero’s past
life—they are all there. Sam Livesey, who
sets fire to the hero’s farm, leaves his watch
behind as evidence for the heroine to find
(“Father, what time is it ?” she inquires
ominously and repeatedly till his ravings die
away in panic), and is finally overwhelmed
with shame and remorse, has figured in hun-
dreds of Surreyside melodramas. Like so
many Elstree productions it isn’t a film at
all, it is a play written by one whose ideas
are fixed in the unreal traditions of Edward-
ian drama, and transferred to the screen.
“England Awake” is infinitely better. It
shows some of the contributions Britons
have made to civilisation—the steam-engine,
steel ships, and so on—during the past cen-
tury, and. with Wellington as a sort of
chorus, presents them in an impressive
manner. The pity is it only lasts about
half an hour. This is where the reticeni
British are always likely to beat the Ameri-
cans. ,

“H’ow,” inquired a “Sun” advt. last Friday,
“can we describe the Thrills of ‘Huddle’
when its thrills are beyond description?
How can we best tell you of its Laughter
when words are inadequate? And of its
Romance when we have never known of
such a love?” And then it was screened at
the Capitol and turned out to be another
Collegiate—the love story of a proletarian
undergrad. (Ramon Novarro) and a rich
man’s daughter (Madge Evans). When
Ramon as an Italian steelworker first
arrives on a scholarship at Yale, his habits
revolt the local aristos; but his courage
(one feat consists in playing through a foot-
ball match with a bust appendix!) wins
him their respect and the girl’s love in
the end. The early shots of Novarro 'at
home with his humble people (Henry
Armetta and Feriko Boros) are good. So
are Una Merkel and Ralph Craves.

In “Man Wanted,” at the Regent, the
heart of Kay Francis (who edits a society
paper, though she doesn’t need the money)
yearns for her male stenog., David Manners.
Her polo-playing husband is addicted to
hooch, gold-diggers and smoke-room stories :
David’s girl is'virtually a mental case, and
has a leaning towards shickered footballers.
So a Paris divorce makes everybody happy.
The principals are good, and there’s nothing
much wrong with Una Merkel and Kenneth
Thomson.
The Palette.
The Society of Artists’ show at the Educa-
tion Department’s gallery, Sydney, embraces
most phases of art, ancient and modern,
and presents something worth saying in
almost every style. Hans Hey sen combines
his justly-celebrated gums with his not-so-
celebrated mountains in “Brachina Corge,”
a very spirited landscape. Eliotli Cruner
exhibits his delicacy in half a dozen paint-
ings, the best of them “Spring,” a Bondi
glimpse that has been shown before. Howard
Ashton crams into the relatively small canvas
of “.Jamieson Valley” a complete treatise on
the art of making a picture. Will Ashton
gets rich effects simply in “August Morning
on the Seine” and “The Quay, Concar-
neau.” The most effective landscape in
the show is Robert Johnson’s “In French's
Forest,” which is full of snap and sparkle.
Bernard Hall has been captivated more than
ever of late by the subject of interiors, and
he presents in his smooth, unruffled style
some very impressive essays on this theme,
and one not so impressive—a glimpse of the
inside of Government House, Melbourne, in
which the pillars and the walls seem out of
plumb. Fred Leist in “A Rummer Morn”
provokes comparisons with “September
Morn,” but gets away with it. John D.
Moore forsakes his mood of fanatical real-
ism to portray a picnic-scene which has
unusual beauty. B. E. Minns presents an
historical picture-—Governor Phillip and
party exploring north of Manly in 1780, a
very well-conceived composition. Henry A.
Hanke’s “Calvary,” semi-decorative in
treatment, contains some fine character
studies. Meritorious gleanings from the
wealth of pictorial material Sydney offers
are H. Badham’s “Neilsen Park.” full of
sunshine and vigor; Rah Fizelle’s glimpse
of a Darlinghurst street: Sydney Ure
Smith’s colored drawing, “Roofs of Mableay
Street.” and William Bustard’s “The Rail-
way Station.” Albert Collins has some
faithful charcoal drawings of the Bradfield
Highway. Still-life studies are numerous,
the most original and best _ painted being
Harvey’s “Buccaneer.” Lionel Lindsay
shows some exquisite woodcuts, and Percy
Lindsay imparts a little quiet humor into an
excellent orchard scene, “The Intruder.”
Norman Carter’s “Golf Girl” leads in the
portrait section, followed at some distance
by Miriam Moxham with a very faithful
portrait of Mick Paul. The show’s crop of
nudes is poor, and none of the exhibits in
this line, save Fred Leist’s dainty drawing
already referred to, offers any adequate ex-
planation as to why the subject lolled
around unclothed.
An important section of this year’s ex-
hibition is devoted to the quarter-size models
of Rayner Hoff’s sculptures for Sydney’s
Anzac Memorial and a small model of the
building, which was designed by Bruce
Dellit. Mr. Hoff’s work has received some
hostile criticism on other than artistic
grounds. /Estheticaily it is admirably in
tune with the purpose and spirit of the
memorial, and exhibits a high degree of
originality and resource in the matter of
composition. The whole thing is finely
conceived and as harmonious as a Shak-
speare sonnet.
Howard Barron, a young English painter
who has not been many years in Australia,
exhibits 25 pictures at Rubery Bennett’s
galleries, Sydney. Some of the landscapes,
particularly those from the Blue Mountains
region, look as if they might have been
painted by Arthur Streeton, but that only
amounts to saying that they very satisfac-
torily reproduce the characteristic scenery.
Barron has an eye for an effective sky, and
one of the best things in the show is
“Approaching Storm.” A river study, “On
the Lane Cove,” demonstrates the clarity of
his style. He knows what he wants to say
and how to say it, and his pictures find
nature in a very pleasant mood. Honey
catches more flies than vinegar, and sales
have been numerous.
Yolande Proctor has got together at Syd-
ney’s Macquarie Galleries a really fine collec-
tion of prints of paintings by Van Gogh.
Cezanne, Monet, Degas, Renoir, et cic., which
are advertised as examples of modern art.
The show has been rushed, not by the people
who don’t know a Van Gogh from a painting
by Ettie, aged seven, but by those who do.
Rome of the stuff still gives the impression
of being remarkably clever, but in those
cases, present critic gathered from the remarks
of devotees, the gifted delineator has dallied
with the Mammon of unrighteousness. It
is only when the drawing looks as if it were
done by an educated cow and the colors
swear at each other with Apache venom that
the style of this sort of thing is .achieved
in all its mystic purity. There is a very
striking study of a lobster, which turns out,
after J.O minutes’ study, to be a gazelle.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Maloua”: “When I first started fishing
sharks were sharks, and not the overgrown
herrings that frighten folks nowadays at
Manly and such places,” began Dave Long-
line, addressing the monthly meeting of
Lodge George Washington. “We hooked a
sizable chap one morning, got the end of
the rope ashore to the beach, dug in our
toes, and tried to haul him in. When I
finally let go the sand was trickling into my
mouth.”
* * i\i *
“Camcor”; While prospecting in N.Q. I
was climbing a granite bar about 40ft. high
that straddled a creek. Its surface was
smooth with the passage of water, and when
almost at the top I slipped and fell. In
falling I wildly grasped w’hat I took to be
a vine. I hung on like a politician to his
salary, and remembered the prayers I’d for-
gotten. Imagine my surprise when, almost
imperceptibly, the vine moved upwards. The
suspense of that gradual elevation was
awful (no pun intended), but at long last
I was drawn over the top into safety. I
looked round, and was dumbfounded to dis-
cover that my deliverer was a beautiful
specimen of a rock python.
* * * *
“G. J.A.S.”: Riding through the paddock
I saw a ewe which had dropped a lamb,
and her peculiar way of looking across to
me and then down at her lamb and back
at me again made me curious. The young
’un (male) had no mouth. The nose was in
the usual place and seemed to be function-
ing all right, but w T here the mouth and jaw
should have been a smooth, wool-covered
skin sloped back to the neck and throat.
I’d found it at last! A drought-resisting
sheep, living only on fresh air and scenery.
I’d start a stud flock and make a little
fortune. Next year I could pay the store
account; the following year the bank over-
draft, and then, perhaps, the rates
and. .. . Here the ewe stamped her foot and
wmlked off. I glanced down. The nucleus of
my stud flock had ceased to breathe.
“Pick”: Unlike most wild birds that
adopt any suitable place for nesting, eagles,
having selected some inaccessible tree, rock
pinnacle or precipice for their nursery,
return year after year. And generations of
the hooky-beaks may occupy the ancestral
demesne. On an unreachable cliff terrace
below- Oallen, in the Shoalhaven Valley
(N.S.W.). to the knowledge of white fos-
siekers of the locality, eagles have reared
A GOOD SET
OLD SALT: “Then we bore up in the teeth of the storm; salvaged the barque, and got
£40,000 for her.”
LISTENER: “H’m! Those teeth had a bit of gold filling — what?”
broods for the last GO summers. The huge
stick platform that forms the foundation of
the eyrie is occasionally rebuilt, sometimes
only patched, and often' left as -it stood the
season before. But the nest above is always
dismantled and replaced with a new struc-
ture.
* * * *
“E.S.S.”: Very rarely seen now in the
eastern regions of this continent is the
stately jabiru, or black-necked stork, which
used to be common enough years ago on
the marshes of the Clarence and Richmond
River districts, where I often found it
breeding. Standing 4ft. high, on
long red legs, its glossy blackish-
green and white coat and huge
bayonet-like black beak show
boldly in the open spaces it fre-
quents. The strange beak is
used for spearing fish in the
swamps and lagoons. The giant
takes the prize for the largest
stick-nest in the bush —a pile of
stout sticks and twigs that
would fill a dray. The . bulk
seems to be chiefly needed to
accommodate the bird’s legs. The
most remarkable thing about the
jabiru, however, is that it has
no voice—it is said to be the
only bird in the -world incapable
of uttering a cry. But it sometimes clatters
its long, hard mandibles together, making
a queer rattle like a chattering laugh.
* * * *
“Maloua”: “Wild cattle?” snorted Monaro
George. “They’re extinct. Cattle nowadays
are tame as sheep, but in the . early days on
Monaro mustering was a man’s job. I
remember a mob of over 100 steers that was
never mustered —not in Australia anywmy.
We chased them from the high country clear
to the coast, and over Jaggers Head (N.S.W.
South Coast), and the last seen of them they
were about a mile out at sea swimming hard.
Three w r eeks later the papers reported a
mob of cattle landing in Maoriland, thin and
tired and with their hides covered with bar-
nacles.”
“Bandar”: A successor has been dis-
covered to the mythical prenny, which
figured awhile on the front pages of the
bellow press. The prenny was a predaceous
lizard, varying in length from five to
50 feet, according to the condition of the
observer. This beast was supposed to in-
habit the “dead heart of Australia,” but
now that that territory is being thickly
populated with rival gold-seeking parties, it
has probably flown in terror into thq ewig-
lccit. The substitute is a “horde of
monkeys,” said to have been discovered by
prospectors in Cape York Peninsula. All
sorts of ingenious theories about monkeys
escaping from captivity and thereafter form-
ing a community in the “unexplored jungles”
of the Peninsula have been aired. Monkeys
are news. The evident fact that the beasts
seen bounding in the ti’ees were good old Aus-
tralian tree-climbing kangaroos, discovered
and described nearly 70 years ago, apparently
is not. The tree kangaroo, compact, furry
and with a long tail, is as nimble in the
tree-tops as any monk., and could easily be
mistaken for one.
:}: iji i>. %
“Bombex”: There is only one thing cer-
tain about bees —-you never know what to
expect from them. One of Kipling’s best
yarns tells how a swarm of bees held up an
English county fair and stopped all the traf-
fic on the local railway line for some hours.
The people who look after the port of Bris-_
bane, which includes some 20 miles of elabo-'
rately lighted river, noticed the other day
that an ever-burning light on an important
channel buoy had gone out. A boat crew
went out from the official launch tp investi-
gate and wrnre savagely attacked by a swarm
of bees which had taken possession of the
buoy. So fierce was the resistance that the
party had to flee back to the launch and
repair damages. Then, returning with petrol
torches and chemical sprays, they routed the
invaders. Examination of the light showed
that a bee had become jammed in the pilot
frame and had fallen across the burner and
extinguished the light. This solitary bee
might well have been the cause of the loss of
a ship worth half a million sterling.
i\t J}» *
“Valerin”; “Homfrey Beale’s” plover (B.
14/9/’32) was not unique. Just before and
after hatching the spur-wing plover is most
vicious. A police trooper near Young
(N.S.W.) was attacked and killed by one
of these birds some years ago, the spur pene-
trating his temple.
“Pagoda”: Little now remains of the old
Victoria settlement at Port Essington
(N.T.), occupied by a detachment of Royal
Marines from 1837 to 1849. The jungle has
claimed its own, but one heritage—the
prickly-pear—is still to be seen. Years ago
Administrator Gilruth paid a visit to the
old settlement, and, on his return to Darwin,
arranged for the destruction of a patch of
prickly-pear, one of the few surviving
growths after the Essington cyclone of Nov-
ember, 1839, which wiped out the settle-
ment. A Chinaman secured the contract, but
instead of burning the pear after cutting and
grubbing, he dumped it into the sea. The
tides did the rest and it is now’ growing
luxuriantly at many points around the
spacious harbor.

THINKING AHEAD
The right kind of thinking ahead, of planning for the future,
is that which is instantly translated into action, when the
thinker, the planner, has decided upon the objective and the
means by which it may be obtained.
Every man or woman who so plans must take money into
consideration, and every man or woman who thinks must
realise how valuable a means the Savings Bank account can be.
It costs nothing, cannot be overworked, and pays an interest
profit commensurate with your tenacity of purpose.

“N.R.”: “Curare” (B. 7/9/’32) omitted the
Malay Peninsula from his list. Malays don’t
use blowpipes, but these conquering pirates
aren’t the aboriginal people of the peninsula.
The Sakais and Sumongs are, and they are
enthusiastic blowpipers. A Sakai sumpitan
in my possession is scabbarded in a light,
polished reed. The pipe itself is feather-
weight, looks like two bamboo-joined, peeled
rods, and is a shade over 6ft. long, includ-
ing the broad disc mouthpiece. The barbed
darts are nine to ten inches long, are tipped
with a dark stain, possibly poison, have a
thickened butt-end, and are housed in small
bamboo containers which in turn are en-
closed in two ornamented bamboo-knot eases
with plaited bamboo, resin-stained lids. Each
case contains a quantity of pith which is
used as an air-compressor behind the darts.
The bamboo cases themselves are held in a
finely-plaited rattan bag, with fibrous cords
for shoulder-straps.
“FY7”: A recent article in the “Austra-
lian Zoologist” is responsible for the state-
ment that the rabbit bandicoot, Otherwise the

from Australia. It seems a large order, but
no doubt correct as far as the closely-settled
areas are concerned. In the ’seventies and

’eighties the queer little beast wag plentiful
in Far Western Queensland, and on the
Barcoo country his big warrens were so
thick in the sand ridges as to make riding-
cattle through them tricky work. It was
noticeable as the years went on and the
country was .more heavily stocked up that
the burrows were gradually deserted, the
bilbies having apparently moved further
towards the sunset. As a small boy it was
my delight to net them, for they made capi-
tal pets, though more vicious biters than most
marsupials. The business was carried out on
the lines of ferreting rabbits in Britain, as
imparted by an English father and uncle. The
nets were cut from an old fishing-net and
pegged lightly over promising holes. Since
we had no ferrets we employed a small fox-
terrier, who, was the apple of my eye. Bilby
burrows are much larger than bunny’s and
the tyke was in little danger, though I was
never happy until he came to upper earth
again. The bolted bilbies went smack into
the loose nets and tied themselves up so
effectually that they often took some time
to extricate. Now and then the menfolk left
out the nets, and standing out in the open
shot the bolting bilbies. Those were days
when marsupials of all kinds literally
swarmed in that rich country and the grower
of sheep had naturally little compassion in
his heart for eaters of his sheep’s grass.

“Cooramin” : Here and there in the east-
ern districts of N.S.W. patches of hard, bare
ground are pitted with small straight holes,
less than l.-16in. in diameter. In each lurks
a tigerish little grub, somewhat resembling
an ant-lion, of a creamy color, with a dark-
brown head, that is ever watching the tiny
disc of light at the top. When a roving
ant crosses it a pair of strong nippers dart
out and seize it. Sometimes the ant gets
away with the loss of a leg, but usually its
adventures end there. It is pulled into the
hole until it is doubled up and unable to
move, then the trapper sucks it dry, butts
the remains into the outer lightness and
settles down to wait in patience for the next
unwary emmet to cross his portal. There
was a well-pitted patch' on our school ground,
and a playtime diversion was fishing for the
occupants with a straw. Sometimes an ant
was guided to its doom, but fishing was
more popular. The inmate bit savagely at
the end of the tormenting straw and was
jerked to the surface. Then two of them
were set together, and they fought like little
bulldogs. The ants attacked the creatures
viciously if they caught them on the sur-
face, and killed them with ease, for their
bodies are soft.

“Flagwagger”: An acquaintance of mine
drives a van between Melbourne and places
in Northern Vie. He carries fishing tackle,
and when camping near a lake a few miles
south of the Dividing Range he often catches
eels. A few miles to thoAnorth of the range
is another lake, but there he never got a
bite. Catching a great number of eels in
the south lake, he liberated them in the north
one. His later attempts to catch eels there
were still unsuccessful. He conveyed a second
batch from the south lake, but this time,
before liberating them in the north, he tightly
fixed rings of wire about them. Subsequent
fishing in the north lake failed to retrieve
even one eel. But later, fishing in the south
lake, he was amazed to catch three eels with
wire rings about them. How did they cross
the Dividing Range? And why their refusal
to remain in the north lake?
“Bangtail”: We
were ringbarking a
box ridge on a pro-
perty adjoining
Bungawalbyn sta-
tion, on the N. S.
Wales North Coast,
and usually took a
short cut across the
station cattle pad-
dock. in which was
a Hereford bull. A
post-and-wire fence
was going up. When
we went out one
morning a 1 ] the
posts were erected
and bored, and the
men were preparing
to run the wires
and expected to fin-
ish by midday. It
was dusk when we
planted our axes
and started home-
wards. We heard a
bellow and, turning,
saw the Hereford
bull, with head
down and tail up,
charging direct for
us. It was a ding-
dong race between
us and the bull for
the new fence and
safety, the bull only
about 40 feet be-
hind. As with one
accord, we flung
ourselves down and
rolled, as we
thought, under the
bottom wire. The
bull, well versed in
wire fences, prop-
ped, snorted and
wheeled off in dis-
gust. Next morn-
ing we decided to
risk the short cut
again, and found to
our surprise there
was not a wire in
the new fence. Just
after we had left
the previous day the
overseer had called
the men off the fence
job to repair a dam that was breaking away.
Now what checked that bull? He’d been
there all day and knew darned well the wires
•weren’t strung.

“Runa" : The member of the council who
mouired some time ago how the imported
tliar was getting on in his Maori-
land home will be glad to hear
that, in common with all M.L.’s
importations, it is thriving ex-
ceedingly. Two herds, totalling
over 100, were seen recently in
the Southern Alps, and hunters
report that the thars now pro-
bably number thousands, the
food on which they subsist being
more plentiful in their new home
than in their native Himalayas.
And as they are wary and sure-
footed, and invariably have a
competent look-out to signal the
approach of danger, they seem
likely to continue to flourish in
the. inaccessible alpine fastnesses
which they share with another
importation, the chamois.
“Ben W'arin”: Eighteen
months’ prolonged drought drove
the brolgas out of the Flinders
River country, and many of them
found their way to Richmond
(N.Q.). By general consent
they are allowed the free-
dom of the city, and are so
much at home that their stately
walk up and down the main
street hardly ceases from day-
light to dark. They have learned
to appreciate cake, biscuits and
fruit. The local ice-vendor is
their special favorite. When he
walks abroad it is quite usual
to see at least one brolga follow-
ing him, military fashion, at
right rear. They evidence their
good manners and breeding by
waiting outside while he trans-
acts business, and exhibit their apprecia-
tion of a piece of cake or other titbit by
a graceful dance and playful antics when he
returns.

MORE TROUBLE IN THE FAMILY.
FREDIE FLATHEAD (to mother ): “Father’s nerves must he bad

shores were a favorite camping ground of
native tribes. At its best now it is merely
an outsize in waterholes, 20 miles long and
14 wide, but it is oftener a dusty plain,
thistle-overgrown, and the feeding ground of
rabbits. To the west of the Carwoola plains,
which once formed a great expanse of the
lake bed, is a gap in the Lake Range through
which flows the Molouglo River. That
gorge wasn’t always there. The treeless
slopes, the water-worn terraces and the
denuded rocks that display no indications
of long weathering, as do the granite
boulders on the outer, prove that the chasm
is of comparatively recent formation. When
the range was continuous the Molonglo had
no outlet. It was then a constant feeder
of the lake and kept the basin filled to
overflowing.
“Roga”: A Mallee (Vic.) farmer, during
the recent mouse plague, went to no end
of trouble to make his stack of hay
mouseproof, only to find that the pests still
gained entry into it. He watched the stack
at night, and didn’t have long to wait before
he saw an amazing spectacle. There was
a tall tree growing near the stack, one
branch hanging over it, although at least 15ft.
above. Up this tree climbed the mice,
scurrying along the overhanging branch and
letting themselves drop on the stack. The
fall temporarily stunned each mouse, but he
would soon be up and about.

“Gumblegubbin”: Some remarkable evi-
dence of the penetrative power of eucalyptus
roots may be seen at Undercliffe, on the bank
of Cook’s River (N.S.W.). In widening the
roads and quarrying for building material,
slices of the sandstone hill were cut from
top to bottom, and revealed roots from half
an inch to an inch or more in diameter that
had penetrated 50ft. or 60ft. almost straight
down through' the solid rock. Some did not
end at the road level, but continued down to
an unknown depth, possibly to the level of
the river. Most of the trees on top, now
nearly all cut away, were stunted and
twisted, the result, no doubt, of the long aud
hard boring to reach moisture. Until that
was attained, all the wet they got was from
rain, for the rocky surface absorbed no water
that could soak down. Still they always
looked fresh and healthy, and showed a brave
top of blossom in season, a striking testimony
to the tenacity of the gum once it has be-
come established.

But I vowed that I’d get her, the day that
I met her.
Miss Mary, the airy, from Merriman’s

’Twas the night at the concert I asked her
to wed me.
She smiled. “Why, you’ve known me for
iess than a week!
If a year doesn’t change it perhaps we’ll
arrange it,”
Said Mary, the wary, from Merriman’s

SOIL-TESTING OUTFITS.
“B. Ware”: A neighbor who is a good
farmer came over to my place in great glee
with a soil-testing outfit for which he had
paid His. 6d. The chap who sold it to him
had said he could double the production of
his farm by correcting the soil acidity if
the soil was acid; and “that soil-tester,
•sir,” was the only means of ascertaining
the condition of the soil in this respect.
The salesman made a test of the soil in
the home paddock, and as it proved acid the
tester was purchased. Some of these sales-
men could sell a gold railway pass to a
politician.
It was Sunday. We jumped into the car
and went for a 20-mile trip across country,
stopping to use the soil-tester on the way.
My friend used his outfit, and I used two
books of litmus-paper (one red and one
blue), which I had bought for sixpence.
Fourteen tests were made, and in every in-
stance the soil was proved acid by both
tests.
A soil-testing outfit is not worth any more
than sixpence on the farm. At least 90 per-
cent. of the soils of Australia are acid. The
litmus test following an application of lime
is interesting, and under certain conditions
instructive, but an application of lime is
essential in the majority of cases, with or
without the test.
In cases of alkaline soils it is, or should
be, known beforehand from a know-ledge of
the country that the soil is calcareous, and
is sure to turn red litmus paper blue, or
change the color of the indicator used in
the soil-tester. I have grave doubts of the
theory that lime corrects soil acidity. Lime
acts in a great many ways as a soil-
improver, and it is possible in the majority
of cases that acid correction is one of the
least important.
To give an illustration, the fertiliser sul-
phate of ammonia, when used on an acid
soil, may not give any appreciable increase
in crop yield. Yet when a few cwt. of lime
(chalk) is applied in conjunction with, but
prior to, the fertiliser, the increase in yield is
pronounced, although, the soil is still acid.
The lime in this instance produces a result,
not by correcting soil acidity, but by increas-
ing bacterial activity. Again, repeated appli-
cations of super, on the same ground, when
sandwiched with applications of lime, give
better results than in the cases of super,
alone. This is not a matter of correcting
soil acidity, but rather the supply of an
assimilative base, with the ensuing good
effect of keeping the phosphoric acid moder-
ately active and in other ways supplying
available plant food.
Soil acidity might worry a scientist, but
the practical farmer need not lose any sleep
over it. Like the income tax, it is for ever
with us, more or less, and very few people
know much about it.
CURE FOR BUSH-SICKNESS.
“V.S.M.”: Sheep and cattle dying of star-
vation while up to their knees in succulent
grasses and clover—this was the theme of
a par. of mine which The Bulletin pub-
lished ten years ago. To-day in that “busli-
siek” district, which embraces about a
million acx*es in Rotorua (M.L.), the
pastures are eaten down to the ground,
and stock are flourishing. Nature had the
remedy waiting to be discovered, and B. C.
Aston, chief chemist of the Department of
Agriculture, has found it. The elixir is
a local iron ore, a hydrated oxide known as
limo'nite, which is much more soluble in
acids than the non-hydrated red oxide, hae-
matite. It occurs in inexhaustible quanti-
ties at Wliangarei and Onekaka, and is soft
and easily ground. Mixed with an equal
quantity of salt and used as a lick, it is
readily eaten by both sheep and cattle—
horses, curiously enough, are not affected by
the sickness.
All doubts as to the efficacy of the remedy
have been dispelled by practical tests by
farmers who have bred and reared healthy
stock where formerly animals commenced
wasting after a few months or even weeks.
And they stay healthy, too. Whether bush-
sickness is caused by some deleterious sub-
stances ejected by the volcanoes which have
showered ashes upon the land during erup-
tions, or by the lack of some essential in the
plant-food, can now remain for scientists
to argue over. What concerns the settler
is that limonite corrects the trouble. The
value of this discovery is greater than
Aston’s salary for his whole working life.
GOOD WORDS FOR SALTBUSH.
“F.A.Q.”: Regarding the cultivation of
saltbush to provide green feed during
droughty months (B. 7/9/’32), tell “James’
that if he can get creeping saltbush estab-
lished he need have no fear of tlic_ next
drought. You require a few points of rain
during the autumn or winter to germinate
the seed. The saltbush will hang on after
that for months, and keep on growing when
everything else is settled. In late summer
it leaves a covering over the ground an
inch deep in seed, and stock will fatten
on the seed for months. Also once you get
it going it is there for good.
I have 1000 acres which has been giving ser-
vice for upwards of 30 years, probably longer.
Anyhow, the oldest inhabitant can remember
it flourishing in 1900—so that’s fair proof
that it persists from year to year. In a
flush season the herbage beats it; but the
saltbush is not needed then. In the following
year it will be there with the first winter
rain, and it fattens the sheep during the
usual dry time following. The only soil
on which it docs not appear to flourish is
the real black loose stuff.
“Cavcsson”: On the sandy soils about
Brighton and Caulfield (Vic.) the ordinary
saltbush ( Atriplex) is becoming a vogue
as a hedge. Seed is broadcast; with a 26in.
rainfall growth is vigorous, but easily con-
trolled. The clippings provide for the cliooks,
the pony and Strawberry, if she is about.
It is remarkable that the possibilities of
this shrub have not been better tested.
Thirty-five years ago I made trial plots in
S.A., inside of Goyder’s rainfall line, in
14in. country. These were grazed rotatively,
and the increased sustenance obtained was
more than commensurate with the added rain-
fall in a locality to which the plant was
not indigenous. Its habitat is the sin. to
7in. zone and there’s neither fluke nor lung-
worm in flocks on saltbush. Cultivation costs
little; run the late summer spring-tooth
twice or thrice over worn-out pasture—suffi-
cient to get a tilth; broadcast the seed
sparingly; if desired, go over with a light
roller; autumn rains will do the rest. Don’t
eat the shrub out in its infancy. Saltbush
beats most green fodders (lucerne excepted)
by showing 90 p.c. of edible as against 10 p.c.
fibrous content. It is well worth the atten-
tion of dairymen in the mid-rainfall, non-
irrigable areas. Paddocks grazed in rota-
tion will reassert themselves without fre-
quent rain ; the root system attends, to that.
No doubt about its recuperative pro-
perties. I have seen many square miles of
Broken Hill country (reduced by 20 months’
dryness to blackened stalks) respond to a
downpour with such a wealth of herbage
that three weeks later it was difficult to see
the sheep in it.
CUTTING PERENNIAL GRASS.
At the Waite Agricultural Research In-
stitute (S.A.) they have a high opinion of
Phalaris tuberosa. A perennial grass indi-
genous to Mediterranean countries, though it
has not been extensively grown there —or
anywhere else —Phalaris tuberosa is regarded
as particularly well adapted to parts of Aus-
tralia in the zone of winter rainfall (parti-
cularly country which gets 18 inches and
upwards per annum) and summer drought.
Reporting. on experiments conducted at the
Waite Institute, Director A. E. V. Richard-
son, H. C. Trumble and R. E. Shapter men-
tion that “high productivity and permanence
of the sward have been obtained where appre-
ciable areas of the grass have been estab-
lished.”
The experiments were aimed at ascertain-
ing the effect of cutting on the yield, pro-
tein and phosphate content of the herbage
and underground portions of the plant.
Phalaris tuberosa seed was sown in pots
filled with a mixture of loam and washed
river sand, super, at the rate of lOcwt. per
acre being applied at seeding and the soil
covered with two inches of gravel mulch.
An elaborate account of the patient, investi-
gation is given in a bulletin issued by the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
Study of the results given by one to five
cuts in a season convinced the scientists, that
one cut is not enough (“the mature herb-
age in the single cut would not be economic
for grazing stock”) and five cuts have too
drastic an effect on the vigor and future
growth of the plant. Having regard to the
provision of nutrients and the need for main-
taining a high degree of productivity, the
Director and his collaborators recommend
three cuts. The bulletin is amply illustrated.
One picture, taken in a Waite Institute pad-
dock, shows a thick growth of Phalnris
tuberosa in its fourth year.
SHARPENING COMBS AND CUTTERS.
“Kripple”: Beginners following Land
Page hints on the sharpening of combs
and cutters should not become discouraged
at complaints about the grinding. Even
experts with long experience often find it
necessary to point out that cutting edges,
no matter how good, will not shear some
wools so cleanly as others. Coming from
sheds where fleeces have been clean and m
good condition, and tallies high, to one
where tallies drop short of their average,
wool-barbers are prone to rush to the ex-
pert growling about their machines or tool-
grinding.
Before altering machines or changing
abrasives for sharpening —the standard
grades of the latter should never be altered
—a consultation with the classer is advis-
able regarding the condition of the staple.
Should ho report the presence of grit much
of the trouble will be from that source,
because no steel will retain a cutting edge
for long where it is present. Frequent
changing and resharpening of tools is the
only remedy. Should the staple be very
tender, it inclines to lie over to the on-
coming comb and cutter to leave the body of
the sheep with a furred, unshorn appear-
ance. Tool-sharpening, however good, will
not provide a remedy, but speeding up the
shafting from the standard of 600 revs, per
minute (Lister and Wolseley machines) will
be helpful, provided it is not overdone. It
should be understood that for each' rev. in-
crease on shafting, cutter reciprocation
increases at a ratio of 4 to 1.
When fleeces are badly affected with
water-rot, my advice to the young expert is
to face what is coming to him and battle
through as best ho can. All the wiles of
my long experience applied to machines,
combs and cutters under such conditions
always failed to give a cut satisfactory to
grazier, contractor or shearer. There is
much room for experiment on the part of
shearing-machine manufacturers in the de-
signing of combs and cutters _ adaptable to
shear cleanly wool in its varied conditions
in place of the now almost universal stan-
dard.
THE USEFUL SMOOGER.
“Curlew”: On page 14 of The Bulle-
tin’s “Handy Hints for the Farm” are par-
ticulars of a rumble and its use in scat-
tering and pulverising stock droppings on
pasture. If you want a larger implement,
try a smooger. A straight sapling 10ft.
long and about Tin. in diameter is split or
(if not straight-grained) sawn down the
middle. Eighteen inches from each end a
mortice about 4in. by 2in. is made. In the
mortices a stout plank having shoulders is
fitted, so as to keep the two planks 2ft.
apart. The planks rest on their edges, the
larger end of one opposite the smaller end
of the other; this gives a better balance.
Two horses easily take the implement oyer
grass land, but for fining_ and levelling-
ploughed land three are required.
This smooger makes a capital grader,
particularly if the soil is in good working
condition. I mostly use it rounded faces
foremost, though if" the soil is pretty dry
it bites well split faces first. Wet soil
will cake in front of it and pack. But it’s
a great pulveriser and leveller and packs
the surface nicely for smaller seeds sown
in dry weather—far better than a roller.
Incidentally, two of my neighbors valued my
“Handy Hints” so much that I had to
present them with copies. My third copy is
ordered and goes under lock and key.
TRENCH SILOS.
“Towser”: Trench silage began with the
first dog when he buried his primeval bone.
Many people have elementary ideas of how
to fill a trench silo. It may be taken that
this has sloping ends and that tile bottom
is of less breadth than the top. The right
way to fill is to begin at one end with, the
heads of the bundles lying on the batter at
the end of the trench. The second row must
be placed with the heads overlapping to
the cobs on the first row. Carry on in
this Aviso along the floor and the last
row—bundles being placed lengthwise along
the trench, of course —will have the
butts on the batter at the other end.
Commence the second layer at the other
end to the first, facing the heads the other
way and overlapping as in the first layer.
Keep on with the reversing process until
the surface is reached. Pack the bundles
as tight as you can and keep the middle
higher than the sides all the time. Roll
down by driving a dray through after each
layer; failing the dray, use a roller, for
the tighter the packing the quicker the
necessary fermentation. Whatever you do
don’t use a motor-car to press down the
silo.
IN FAVOR OF BULK-HANDLING.
“Soustralian”: In common Avitli most
opponents of bulk-handling, “Salmon Gum”
(B. 7/9/’32) appears to have based bis
objections on ignorance of the facts of wheat
transport. How otherwise can one account
for his. amazing statement that trucks
adapted for wheat haulage (they would
have apertures sealed and, perhaps, the
sides raised) might be useless to carry
super.? Most Japanese ports are equipped
to handle wheat in bulk, as are the principal
Chinese ports, Shanghai and Hankow.
Westralia is a long way from Sydney, so
“S.G.” may be excused for not knowing
that millions of bushels of wheat have been
shipped in bulk to China and Japan from
that port.
There are only two exporting countries
of any consequence which cling, to bag-
handling, Australia and Argentina; and
Argentina is now shipping extensively in
bulk. As far as Asiatic buyers are con-
cerned. Argentina is out of the picture on
account of distance; if the wheat does not
come from Australia, it must be drawn
from either Vancouver or one of the U.S.A.
Pacific ports. All these places ship in bulk.
THE BEST STOCK FENCE.
“Booraby”: It is a two-rail, with a wire
between the rails and another between the
bottom rail and the ground. That fence will
hold any kind and any size of stock, am;
it keeps in good repair fcjr a lifetime,
whereas an all-wire, which is cheaper, gets
slack or breaks through animals rubbing
against it or putting their heads through the
wires. It is necessary, however, to talc
pains and make a substantial job of your
two-rail. In a long experience in many
parts of the country I have seen very few
that' were perfectly put up, the chief fault
in 90 cases out ot 100 being in the fitting
of the rails in the posts.
See that your posts arc of even thick-
ness, say 3in., trimmed on all sides, and
free of splinters and nicks; your rails Sin.
by 2-Jin. and 9ft. 6in. or 10ft. long; your
mortice holes Gin. by 2-Jin. —or rails 2im
and mortices 2in. You can then cut all
your rails comfortably in the shade of a
tree or where they are split, for every pane!
is alike. Cut the ends of the rails to come
flush with the post on each side, making a
3in. shoulder on the bottom (3in. long and
2in. deep) and none on the top; and
shoulder the inner flat side to half the thick-
ness of the rail. The shoulders should be cut
with a small rip-saw, and the pieces adzed
off the side and split off the edge with a
sharp axe. The saw-cut takes very little
longer than chopping, makes a better fit.
and thus more fireproof and weatherproof.
When the rails are up you can’t see any
ends, and all the rails are in a perfectly
straight line, whereas in the common way
of fencing there is a screw on every panel,
and a long shoulder on the outer flat side of
the rails. Each post is bored for the wires
after it is rammed, and the wires may be
strained anywhere; there is no necessity for
special strainers or for stays.
In general practice the top rail of a fence
is lighter than the bottom one, the latter
being often very heavy and over a foot -wide.
There is no advantage in this, and the extra
wide rail has to be deeply shouldered. But
if a lighter rail is preferred for the top, it
must be wide enough to have at least an
inch shoulder on the edge. The posts should
have a straight face from end to end. and
be sunk from 20in. to 2ft. in the ground.
EDUCATING THE YOUNG HORSE.
“Liss” ; If you wish your horse to stand
with the reins dangling in front of him,
lie should be taught when first broken in.
and the education should be thorough—ns
indeed it should be in all respects. Select
a spot not far from the kitchen, or some-
where where there is a certain amount of
quiet traffic, so that he will become accus-
tomed to stand as taught while movement
flows round him. Attach a short length of
chain to a heavy log, which must be buried
horizontally and rammed tight. The chain
will just appear above the ground: to its
end attach a swivel, such as a hobble-chain.
Before the lesson starts the colt will have
learnt the power of a rope up in the yards.
When attached to this chain he can try his
hardest without any danger of hurting him-
self, as there is nothing to hurt himself
against, nor does it matter if he throws him-
self down. Put on him a strong headstall
and rope that you can trust, and over this
a bridle ; tie him to the chain by the rope
and allow the bridle reins to hang. Now
go away and leave him. He will soon learn
not to try to pull away, and not to be afraid
of the movement about him. The most im-
portant thing is to see that you do not have
a failure. If the log pulls up. if the. rope
breaks, or if anything should happen to
allow him to get away, you can never be
sure of him after. But if you succeed, he
will stand and pivot on the spot where the
reins touch the ground.

research station. The investigator was Mr.
Barnard, and his experiments showed that
tlie vine makes annual root growth compar-
able to the leaf and branch growth, the bulk
of the activity being in the top 10 inches
of soil. Hence, it is beneficial to cut these
roots to a depth of 10 inches in an early
winter ploughing. The vine is essentially a
shallow rooter and a surface feeder. The
main roots tend to strike down in an oblique
direction to a depth of two feet, occasionally
deeper, and from these roots feeders, strike
up towards the surface. From tlie feeders
in turn grow small root hairs which do
the actual work of feeding the vine.
Mr. Barnard discovered that root growth
does not commence until a week or two
after bud-burst. There is apparently enough
food taken in by the old roots to provide
the energy to bring out the buds. Associated
with this early growth is a small organism
on the roots which aids in the_ assimilation
of moisture and food. The feeding roots
begin to grow in late September, become
active in October and make tremendous
growth in November. After that they prac-
tically cease growing, except for small ex-
tensions immediately following irrigations.
These experiments definitely suggest the
advisability of cutting all the feeding roots
by deep ploughing so as to avoid the over-
lapping and choking caused by the previous
season’s growth. Incidentally, the job of
taking out the vines was exceptionally tedious.
In the first one done, the dirt was scraped
out with oocket-knives and earned carefully
away until the whole structure was exposed,
and the vine still maintained in position.
SPRING CLEANING IN FQWLHOUSES.
“ J. Point”: With the advent of warm
weather, the red mite will come out again
at night. Spray houses thoroughly with a
kerosene emulsion, fortified by a little
phenol. Make sure you get into every crack
and crevice, and have perches protected at
the ends. If perches are suspended from
the roof, and the rods on which they are
suspended treated regularly with kerosene
emulsion or a fairly strong solution of Black-
leaf 40, red mite won’t worry you much.
For dealing with body lice, provide a
good dustbath, adding some wood ashes and
a little sulphur, and keeping the whole just
moist —the hens will then look after them-
selvea.
Where worms are noticed, don’t mess about
with home remedies —there are capsules on
the market which are almost 100 per cent,
effective. They may appear somewhat costly,
but it is a wise investment, as worm-free
pullets will soon repay you by increased
production. Worm-infested stock will never
do any good.
For the summer days, see that you have
something coming on that will furnish shade
—sunflowers or some such quick-growing
leafy plants are recommended. Finally, if
your birds are to stand up and produce well
through severe heat, their health must ,be
good; that means the best of feeding and
plenty of green feed. Lucerne, silver beet
and lettuce are advised, and planted now
and kept growing will be available when
most needed.

(I) flow arc Spanish lentils grown, and

information as regards soy beans?- —1760.
(1) This lentil (Lens esculenta) requires
warm sandy soil, and should be planted at
about the time soup beans are. In India it
is abundantly produced in the Central Pro-
vinces, and is often grown as a mixed crop
with barley. As a legume it would natur-
ally be a soil improver, but it is uncertain
whether it could be grown successfully in
Tasmania. It would probably be advisable
to import the seed from Europe. (2) Soy
beans are grown in northern Asia for
human food, and for the manufacture of
food products in which the mature seed is
the important part of the plant. Some
varieties have been grown in Australia, but
w;th no conspicuous success. It is an
annual legume growing 2ft.'to 3ft. high and
may be used as forage—as hay, silage
or pasture. If properly made, the hay ranks
nigh as a roughage, especially for sheep,
ami is often fed successfully to dairy cows
and other livestock. There is usually more
waste in feeding soy-bean hay than lucerne
hay. due to. the stems being woody and
coarser. H’ay yields range from one to three
tons. Ground soy beans and soy-bean cake
will furnish home-grown high protein con-
centrates to balance rations for livestock.
Yields of seed depend on soil and weather
conditions; 20 to 30 bushels (601 b. per
bushel) per acre are often obtained on
better soils, while on lighter soils, they vary
from 5 to 20 bushels. The crop is usually
cut with a mower, although scythes are often
used.

peppermint, 10 drops; glycerine, loz.; rose-
water to make a stiff paste. Mix the mag-
nesia and oil in a mortar, add the glycerine
and other ingredients, ending with the rose-
water, and mix thoroughly. Store in screw-
top jars. (2) Beat in a large basin a small
packet of Lux and A cup boiling water; when
the soap is dissolved, add 1 dessertspoon
olive oil and a few drops of any perfume.
Beat till thick and creamy, about five
minutes, and store in screw-top jars. The
quantity stated makes two large jars.
HINTS FOR TIIE FARM.
"Bloss”: If necessary to shear a ewe heavy
in lamb, try blindfolding her. It stops her
struggling, which may be fatal to a sheep
in that condition.
“James”: The efficacy of the footbath
containing bluestone or formalin is increased
by putting stones about the size of marbles
on the bottom. These clean the mud from
the feet of the sheep with footrot, and enable
the healing fluid to do its work better.
“Scone”: To get your money’s worth from
horse rugs, look after them when they are
not in use. , As soon as the cold weather
is over, take your rug and spread it. out,
canvas up, on some flat surface, rub the
sole of your boot over all the caked mud
and manure, and finish off with a stiff millet
broom. Shake rug and oil straps with crude
castor oil, and fold when dry, using naphtha-
lene and pepper on the kersey. When you
open them up for use again they will be
ready to put on the horse’s back.
“Dimon”: An effective bush remedy for
a sanded moke is a mixture of molasses and
common soap, dissolved in a little warm
water. If lie will eat, it can be given to
him in his chaff.
“Werrimee”: Instead of feeding horses in
nosebags at the homestead, use a bag trough.
This can be made in a few minutes by hook-
ing a couple of bags lengthwise to a fence
and using a light pole for the front side, or
the bags can be hooked between the shafts
of a cart. The trough is more comfortable
than the bag, especially in hot weather.
“Searchlight” : The best crop of wheat I
ever saw during a drought was at Never-
tire (N.S.W.). The farmer believed in
cultivation. Getting no rain after the
wheat came up, lie fed it off, then harrowed
it; fed it off again and harrowed it a second
time. The barrowing (done three times)
reduced the number of plants considerably,
but he was the only man thereabouts who
got a crop at all. Only a two-bag crop, but
worth money that year.
“D.11.R.”: Don’t allow a weed crop on
fallow land to run to seed or a dirty yield
from the next sowing is inevitable. The
sooner you destroy weeds the better, as while
they last they are robbing the legitimate
crop of its future food and drink, partly
nullifying the results of your labor in fal-
lowing. As soon as they reach sufficient
density to warrant it, run the cultivator
over the plot, selecting a hot, dry day for
the job, so that the torn-up weeds will die
quickly.
“Mulgo” : This i.s the time to clean up all
rank vegetation and rubbish around the
homestead. Very little, including dry leaves,
will carry a fire to buildings and haystacks.
If there is much dry stuff and litter about,
burn a wide break, then you’ll have a green
safety zone when a bush fire comes sweep-
ing along on a hot windy day. Stock will
concentrate on the young feed and keep it
short. Where there is much tall grass near
at hand, cut it and stack it; besides ensur-
ing safety it will be useful later on—especi-
ally if your main paddocks get burnt out.
"Gumblegubbin”: If there is a bit of
ground on the farm that seems worthless,
make a tipping place of it for the manure
from the cowyard, pigsty and fowlshed, and
for rubbish of all kinds that will rot, and
plough them in, a strip at a time. Un-
promising patches can bo converted into
fertile soil m this way. Good material is
leaves, cleanings from the garden and the
debris left by floods. By utilising such
litter, you get value from rubbish, and at
Ihe same time keep your surroundings clean.
“L’Fou”: An offensive is being waged in
Yic. against oodlin moth by means of arsenical
sprays. To minimise the danger of poison-
ing bees, be sure that the greater part of
the petals have fallen before commencing
spraying. This will also ensure the spray
going further and giving better value. Have
plenty of clean water available in suit-
able bee-watering places so the bees fftay be
less drawn to spray drip. If aphides' are
in the trees, bees will be attracted bv the
honeydew and may be poisoned by arsenic
used. To overcome this add up to 40 p.c.
nicotine sulphate; this will repel the bees
and destroy the aphides.
“Only Dave”: The best expert in whose
company I’ve fought the fruit-fly plumped
straight out for the W. B. Gurney method
of foliage baits. The recipe was: Boil 61b.
any kind of fruit in a gallon of water for
an hour. Strain and add 3 gallons water.
41b. molasses and soz. lead arsenate, and
thoroughly mix by stirring. Spray about
a couple of ounces on a prominent patch on
each side of every tree about once a week,
using always the same site for the bait. Con-
tinue treatment till fruit ripens, always
renewing immediately after rain of more
than five points. Cost, one-fifth of a penny
per tree per dose. My man claimed 65 per
cent, mortality against the enemy, and as
far as I could judge he got it.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER

Distinguished Social Lite.
Spring has come back to our Botanic
Gardens; the little statues forget to shiver
and the azaleas break in waves of purple and
rose, or fling their white foam into the
warm air. Even grey skies and scurries of
rain have not wholly spoiled their beauty,
nor the rich, languorous charms of the white
wistaria near by. Spiky stems of plum-
blossom cluster close in their bushes, while
the branches of white, rose and red flower-
ing peach and plum liglit with their cande-
labra the pale-green avenues of budding Sep-
tember. Lovers walk here, and mothers and
fathers with their children. Close at hand
the wishing-trec spires to Heaven ; and on a
day when warm sunshine chased the silk-
soft rainy middle-age was to be seen walking
around it—down-at-heel, perhaps out-of-work
middle-age; but not altogether poor middle
age, since it had faith enough to believe
that God still walks at. eve through Hi:-
gardens, and bends His ear to the whisperings
of His trees.
And Centennial Park is breaking into the
laughter of poppy and pansy, and primula
and marigold. The ducks are hurrying back
to the overflowing ponds, the rose-vines cling
with satin tendrils to their arches, a swan
with its young breasts the curling waves, all
the ways are clean-washed; and the scent of
earth, pierced by the arrows of-rain, rises to
the nostrils. This, is, at least as far as
Nature can make it, the happiest spring for
years.
They are going to build two hundred
corridor tram-cars for Sydney, and to that
extent, at any rate, we shall see the last
of the outrageous system of compelling con-
ductors to clamber along a footboard exposed
to all weathers and traffic perils to collect
fares. But there is another abomination
which the designers and builders should
avoid. It is bad enough for the youug and
sprightly and untrammelled to climb up into
the lumbering vehicles now in use, especially
if the road slopes quickly from the tram
lines, as it often does ; it is both dangerous
and cruel for old people and women with
children —and women with . children are, as
a rule, pretty well lodded with bags and
parcels, too. If Mr. Cleary, the transport
chief, were 10 times the potentate he is, he
would still be a very human man; and if
the matter comes his way, we shall know
that old age and motherhood will get con-
sideration.
When the Harbor Bridge was built elabor-
ate provision was made for collecting tolls,
but none at all for sheltering the toll-
collectors. So there they stand, in one of
the most exposed places in all Sydney, the
winds howling around them and the rains
beating down upon them, entirely unpro-
tected. Almost as soon as the bridge was
opened it was seen that here was something
forgotten, and before the winter set in
shelter was to be provided. The winter has
passed, and the toll-bars are still bare of
any. “But they’re getting them ready for
us.” .said one cheerful Digger last week.
"Mrs. Kirby is making some and Wood
Coflill’s the others”—Mrs. Kirby and Wood
Coffill being the city’s best-known under-
takers.
Among the Mariposa passengers outward
bound were Dr. and Mrs. C. R. Mcßae. He
is a son of the Acting-Director of Education
in Victoria, and he travels on a research
scholarship which will keep him two years
in the IT.S.A. Il'is mission is to study
methods for the education of the abnormal
and the sub-normal child ; our system, while
no doubt excellent for the normal youngster,
is not adequate for the unduly brilliant or
the under normal. The Mariposa carries
away a great cargo of brains, among them
those of Frank Tate, late Director of Edu-
cation in Victoria, and Dr. and Mrs. K. S
Cunningham, who are also going abroad on
research work. Professor and Mrs. P. R.
Cole entertained them at a party at the Aus-
tralia on Friday, when they met many high-
lights of our own educational system.
Sybil Thorndike played a winning double
last Saturday—her “Medea” matinee was
followed by “Captain Brassbound’s Conver-
sion.” Her Lady Cicely Waynflete in the
evening show was an amazing change-over
from the revenges, the hates and the storms of
the Greek matron to the volatile gaiety of
the irresponsible lady who walked across Africa
alone, except for her little dog. How dewily
fresh and young Sybil looked as the English-
woman in her grey bolero suit (1899 model)
with its flash of green, and the green sailor
hat with its coy pink rose! Afterwards, out-
side Sybil’s dressing-room (the crowd was
too big to .squeeze inside), her husband,
Lewis Casson, and their son Christopher,
both in their rather disreputable freebooter
togs, helped her say thank-you to congratu-
■ lations, while Albert Chevalier, the young
man in the white duck uniform of the
U.S.A. Navy captain, paled for the pallor
of his Yankee accent before the much more
robust one of a fair daughter of Uncle Sam
who was offering praises. Among the moths
about the star was Mrs. Francis Shaw,
friend of Sybil’s brother and her flying son.
Charlie Westmacott paid the lady the un-
usual compliment of sitting out the entire
show. Other brisk applaudcrs included that
pretty pair of friends Mrs. Davis and Mrs.
Shur'eck, the latter’s little waist-short coat
of white moire with its puffed sleeves worn
over a grass-green frock; Mrs. J. Bancks, the
Cherniavskys and Dr. Orchard.
Already the Grecian influence is being
seen in the intense smouldering gaze and the
hair brushed back from the brow of many a
young woman. Next week, one supposes, the
Lady Macbeth glassy stare will have a bit
of a vogue. But, ye gods, let not the Little
Theatres burst out into a rash of Greek
tragedies!
Children don’t learn to spell nowadays
the way mother and father did. Modern
teaching has found the value of phonetics,
and sometimes fond parents get a bit bewild-
er e d when
little Jim or
Jane goes
around making
what to the
fond parent is
a funny sound,
and yet de-
clares it is old
friend B or G.
Ethel Cotton,
the girl in
this Bulle-
tin photo-
gra p h, has
compiled a
modern A B C
book “to link
the home with
ihe school, so
that parents
may und e r-
stand how the
child is being
taught.” To
follow the A B 0 the same child-lover has
published a modern speller, and the two are
meeting with a glad reception in juvenile
classrooms. Ethel is a graduate of Sydney
Kindergarten and Preparatory Teachers’
College her brother is Professor Cotton, and
sister Lily is on the staff of the Presbyterian
Ladies’ College. Father is Frank Cotton,
who was one of the most thoughtful mem-
bers of the original Parliamentary Labor
party —and that was a good many years ago.
Professor Mungo MacCallum held his lis-
teners spellbound in the Great Hall of the
University during the delivery of his oration
on Walter Scott. This was the high star set
on the brow of the centenary, so far as
Sydney’s observance of it is concerned, and
during the hour and a quarter that he spoke
not so much as a chair creaked. The clea,r
voice had the softness of spring rain warip
with sun ; as. it beat into the brain yoii
were back in the Highlands. Where
there had been walls were slopes covered with
broom and gorse, and bleak mountain-side
and twisty hill-path, and ruins in moonlight,
and tarns flashing silver in the sudden sun.
And you dreamed with the romantic young-
ster of the romances and the glories "of the
scattered clans ; you laughed with the gay
humor of the young lawyer (one suspects he
was quite a dandy in the Edinburgh of his
day) ; you saw him, later, receiving with
amazement the gift of two emus from an
Australian admirer, he having expected them
to be two green or red parrots; later still,
with a twinkle in the eye, passing them on
to the Duke of Buccleueb ; and finally, most
glorious picture of all. you saw him old,
his fortune gone, racked with pains, sitting
down to write, write, write—that his debts
might be paid to the last penny.
Ailsa Cullen came down from the Moun-
tains with her father for the occasion, and
the orator’s lady was a front-seater with
Beulah Bolton. Poet Le Gay Brereton, Dr.
Maekaness and his wife, Captain Patrick
and G. 11. Morice were up front; and Mrs.
Lightoller, Professor Nicholson, acting-Vice-
Chancellor Selle, Dr. and Mrs. Currey, Pro-
fessor Holme, Dr. and Mrs. Mackie. and the
Butterleys of the English Australian Associa-
tion were other rapt listeners.
Minister for Customs Harry Gullett had a
sad home-coming from' Ottawa last week, for
jijst as the Monowai was about to touch
Wellington (Maoriland) he received the
radio telling him of his sister Anna’s tragic
end. Anna, who had never been heard to
say an unkind word of anyone, had been
staying at Leura for some time for her
health. She wrnlked out from her boarding-
house on a dull Saturday afternoon, and was
never seen alive again. On the Monday, after
extensive searching around the local beauty
spots had failed to find any trace of her, the
slender body of this little friend of all the
world was discovered not a mile from the
house, where she had apparently been
trapped by the mist, and heart failure did
the rest. Expressions of sympathy from
every State have been pouring in on the
grieving mother and journalist Isabel Gullett,
her sister.
A fine old lady whose 91st birthday has
just been celebrated in Armidale, Mrs. Fred-
erick R. White, of Booloominbah, is one of
the links with the little expedition that
camped on the shores of Sydney Cove in
1788. Mrs. White is a grand-daughter of
Dr. Thomas Arndell, a surgeon of the First
Fleet, and later the complete medical staff of
the first rough hospital in old Parramatta.
The head of a black ram, the monster
cairngorm on its brow ornamenting the lid
of a snuff-box, dominated the Highland
Society’s Ball, which was the first frivolity
in the Walter Scott Centenary celebrations.
Thistle brooches and ribbons in the Royal
Stuart tartans were worn by the committee
(this was a young people’s venture) ; there
was the skirl of pipes as the vice-regals
entered the ballroom to the spirited “Stirling-
shire Militia.” There was the flash of gold
thistle and of the knees of youth and
middle-age Avhen your Highlander got really
going in something suspiciously like our
barn dance. Pipe-Major Mackay was in his
element, and the shade of James Burns
seemed to stand applauding beside the ram’s
head, which had been one of his gifts to
the society.
The Governor and Lady Game, just back
from out West, were greeted by the committee,
led by Captain Patrick, the president, who
with son Ken swung along bravely in their
kilts. As for Mrs. Ken, she looked as melt-
ing as a bit of Turkish delight in her froth
of pink tulle lit by crescents of silver sequins.
Mungo MacCallum brought a mind stored
with the Scott tradition and his tall lady
wearing wistaria mauve velvets. A breath
of the Navy blew in with Captain Feakes
and his wife; Mrs. Walder stood by her
Lud Mayor in lobelia-blue chiffons; Belgium's
literary Consul-General Segaert came with
wife and daughter; the Morices were among
the notable, the two Morice girls demonstrat-
ing the cotton evening-frocks in batiste and
in pique. The newly-arrived shepherd of
Scots, Padre Cairns, whose popular lecture
on Scott was one of the week’s events, was
in the official party with his wife; Mrs.
Norton was a very capable president of the
ball committee.
This Letter went out to Cinesound studios
last week to see one or two scenes from
“The Mutiny of the Bounty” filmed. Un-
fortunately they were not the native dances
that Censor
O’R ei 11 y is
m e d i t ating
upon, only
scenes made
up of th e
groans of the
prisoners and
the suck and
hiss of the
waves against
the rebellious
ship. In an-
other part of
this hive (the
staff numbers
45, and only
two bits of
mechanism in
the place are
not the work
of Australian
hands) some
“shots” wer<
being made of
the fo’c’sle, and here the girl in this pic-
ture, Mrs. Charles Chauvel, was busy. She
acts as script girl for her husband’s pro-
ductions, and her job is to see to such details
as whether a dashing sailor wears his hibis-
cus over his right ear or his left. She was
“on location” all the time with her husband
in Tahiti, where the greater part of the pic-
ture was made. Before her marriage she
was Elsa Sylvaney, and appeared in both
screen work and legitimate drama —in the
United States she played opposite Conway
Tearle in. “Mid-Channel.” Monte Luke made
this picture.
Two cocktail parties put a kick into the
week, one in old Elizabeth Bay House, the
other given by the Dante Society in its lair
below Macquarie-street. The former was
organised by Sadie Budge, Gretchen Borsdorf'f
and Mrs. It. A. Eakin to stock their soft-
drinks stall at the coming Bush Nursing fete
in the grounds of Government House. To it
went the young bloods of Sydney in their
scores, and the party, which started at five,
turned out to be one of those non-stop affairs
that went on its gay way till midnight.
Lots of people sampled it both before and
after dinner, and some just didn’t bother to
leave, but stuffed an extra hotdog or two
into the cavity generally reserved for dinner.
The second party was just as merry,
though not so prolonged. It was a welcome
to Italy’s new Consul-General Ferrante and
to Dr. and Mrs. Moran, who have just re-
turned from their travels, one of the liigh-
lights of which was an interview with Mus-
solini. The Dictator’s portrait has pride
of place on the walls of this underground bit
of Italy. Nor, of course, is Dante over-
looked ; and banners and colorful bits, of
Italy adorn the room. The pottery jugs
from which the cocktails were poured were
more pictorial than the better-known shaker.
The Bavins, the Railway Clearys, the
Walter Burfitts and Mrs. Bernard Muscio
came to this, party, Dr. Baccarini was the
host, and Mrs. Ferrari-Passmore, Mrs.
Fiaschi, Dr. Marie Bentivoglio and artist
Dattilo Itubbo among the well-known in the
crowded room.
A bit different from the estaminets or the
Y.M.C.A. hut behind the lines was the ball-
room of David Jones’s last week when the
2nd Division of the Australian Military
Forces rallied around their colors. These
were displayed in brilliant flower arrange-
ments, and the 55tli Battalion surrounded a
life-size kangaroo. The engineers spanned
their table with a model of the Harbor Bridge.
The Governor and Lady Game arrived to a
fanfare of trumpets, and seasoned war-
horses like Charles Rosenthal. Gordon Ben-
nett and S. C. E. Herring sniffed powder again.
Lady Game, looking wonderfully well after
her country tour, wore black chiffons blazing
with diamente, and Miss Crowdy, handsome
in beige laces, came with the party. Tucked
white chiffons topped by a rose-pink velvet
coat were worn by Mrs. Mills, who came
with her Brigadier. The Feakes and
Stevens couples and the Farquhar-Smiths
represented the Navy, and as pretty a flutter
of debs, as any ball might boast was pre-
sented to vice-royalty by the Rosenthal lady.
“The Anti-Hiking Government’’ some
young things are already calling it. The
twenty-oners and those who will be twenty-
oners by next election are a bit up in the
air about Premiers taking sides on the w.hat-
sliall-our-girls-do-with-their-Sundays issue.
After all, the week-ends are the only chance
■working girls and boys get to follow sweet
fancy, and it would be a strange thing if the
next elections should be lost or won on this
question. But elections are so far off that,
for a time, some politicians perhaps are say-
ing a little of what they really think.
From the Sugar State:—
The Governor had a party at Government House
for the crippled children of Brisbane, who came out
under the care of Toe H nurses. The lawns being
wet, the youngsters were taken for a car-jaunt to
One Tree Hill.
At the Boy Scouts’ training grounds, Eprapah.
Redland Bay, Sir Leslie Wilson, in shorts and Scout
rig-out, was regaled by his hosts with fowl wrapped
in wet paper and cooked in the coals, and saw
the boys put up a signal tower. His Ex. addressed
the lads on Boy Scouting in India, where, during his
five years of office, the number of those enrolled
rose from 4000 to 30,000.
The C.J. presented the annual prizes at the
Dickens Fellowship meeting, Dr. W. S. Oumbrae
Stewart being in the chair. “Don’t spoil your boys
by giving them ‘white shirt’ occupations,” he told
the parents. There were 51 entries for the Essay
Competition and Mrs. P. J. Symes gave excerpts
from “Dombey and Son.”
Everyone was sorry to hear of the death of
genial W. J. Affleck, late manager of the National
Life Association. He was born at Killarney, near
Warwick, 64 years ago. Cattle-breeding was his
hobby and it is 40 years since he began his associa-
tion with Brisbane National Show. He is survived
by his mother, his widow, two daughters and a son.
At Ithaca Presbyterian Church John B. Bedgood
and Annie Lambe were made one. The bride, who
was given away by her father, was in ivory satin
and veil caught with seed pearls. Jean
McGregor-Lowndes, Jean Morgan and Mary Palmer
'maided in powder-blue, and Doris Lambe was
flower-girl in pink. Pink and blue lupins adorned
the Jenolan for the feasting.
Barbara Sisley produced “Othello” in aid of the
Shakespeare Society, Leo Guyatt playing the name
part with real power. Loftus Hyde was lago and
Jean Trundle Desdemona; George Shaw and Dr.
Duhig played minor roles. Griffith-Oxley stage-
managed. On the same night Lena Hammond's
choir held the Albert Hall.
St Andrew’s, Creek-street, saw the wedding of
Jack Robertson, Indooroopilly, and Antoinette
Donaldson. Arum-lilies, poinsettias, azaleas and white
roses made the color scheme. Magnolia satin was
worn by the bride, with a broidered tulle veil.
Cream satin with scarlet posies tricked out the
’maids, Cecil Donaldson, Judith Crombie, Betty
Douglas and Marjorie Hill.
St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church was filled for
the marriage of Donald Cormack, of Meandarra,
Dalby, and Gwen Gillespie, daughter of the A. B.
Gillespies, Albion Heights, Brisbane. White satin
with a coat of Honiton lace, once worn by her
great-grandmother, and a veil of hand-embroidered
net, another family heirloom, were worn by the
bride, who was given away by her father. Airs.
P. C. Tann was matron of honor in turquoise. The
feasting was at Rowe’s banqueting hall.


Have You These
Symptoms of
Self - Poisoning ?
Through faulty or incomplete evacua-
tion of the howels, fragments of food
waste from digestion become encrusted
on the walls of the intestine. Germs
breed in this waste matter and enter
the blood stream, resulting in dreaded
self-poisoning ( autoxima), caused
through hidden and unsuspected con-
stipatiom These virulent poisons cir-
culating through the body undermine
the health, weaken the vitality and di-
rectly sap the strength. The life-giving
organs of Nature lose power to func-
tion properly. This leads to constipa-
tion, headaches, indigestion, gas in the
stomach and bowels, catarrh, backache,
rheumatism, neuritis, eczema, weakness
of certain organs, and hosts of other
ailments.
Before the health of youth can be
restored this poisonous matter must be
driven out of the system. And the safe,
sensible way to do this is to drink
COLOSEPTIC —the newer kind of in-
ternal cleanser. It first loosens and
dissolves, then smoothly washes out the
decaying waste. It rids the body of
all poisons and blood impurities
through Nature’s four outlets —the colon
or large intestine —the kidneys—the
pores of the skin—and the respiratory
apparatus.
With the decaying crust removed, the
intestine scrupulously clean, and the
circulatory impurities driven from the
system, pure wholesome blood once
again flows through your veins. Help
yourself to health. Drink COLO-
SEPTIC in hot water every morning.
Feel your old vim and vigour return-
ing—your pulse leaping to the thrills
of life. Note your step becoming more
sprightly, and how your old aches,
pains and ailments are gently smoothed

The fashion of the paper hat has been
revived. Many years ago crepe paper, cut
into strips and finely plaited, stitched on
the lines of a straw shape and wired, was
popular for summer wear. As such nut-
covers cost only a shilling or two, plenty of
variety could be indulged in. The new form
of paper millinery is not as pretty as- he
old, but tin? material is rain-proof. It makes
a good substitute for the lacquered and
varnished straw modes of' the moment.
The weather was sunny but chilly for the
races at Moonee Valley. Tailored suits were
favored by many of the fair patrons, and
the new diagonal and check materials had
an outing, in association mostly with fui-s
and felt hats. Mrs. Murray Smith was in
a black and white tweed suit, with a match-
ing- close-fitting hat. Mrs. Robert Menzies
was similarly attired in blends of brown and
fawn. Mrs. James Purves and her daughter
Valerie put their faith in black tailored cos-
tumes and black hats, with touches of
white. Mrs. Percy Blackbourn cheered her
black suit with a vest of white Irish crochet,
topped by a shiny white straw hat. Mrs. Val
McDonald wore a short coat of black broad-
tail with a black frock and felt hat, a
scarf in red, black and white giving con-
trast. Among the patrons were Lud Mayor
Smith, the R. M. Cuthbertsons, Mrs. A.
Tolhurst, Dr. and Mrs. A. F. Joyce and
Mrs. J. Roberts.
The Girl Guides, as the basis for this
year’s competition for the Stradbroke Cup,
were invited to show their skill in home
handicrafts, and they responded to the call
iu a manner that surprised the grown-ups.
The upper Town Hall housed the entries..
Each district —and about 60 were repre-
sented—-was allotted an equal space and
given a free hand regarding the setting of
its work. The exhibits mostly took the form
of furnished rooms or well-stocked shops.
There were nurseries, kitchens, bedroom®,
dining-rooms and schoolrooms, camps with
tents or shacks, a caravan, dolls’ houses, a
farm aud an orchard. Many of the Guides
proved themselves expert carpenters and
furniture-makers. For instance, the Pres-
ton company was represented by a bedroom
with bed, wardrobe, dressing-table, etc., very
neatly made and finished in white. The rest
of the furnishings were in shades of pink or
blue. Kew, Caulfield, Oakleigh and Mur-
rumbeena were represented by nurseries,
perfectly appointed, with whole sets of in-
fants’ clothes hanging up, peeping out of
drawers or being aired before very realistic-
looking fires.
Hawthorn Guides stored their wares in
a well-set-up shop, in which were a chip-
carved chair and screen, knitted jumpers and
soft toys set out on narrow blue shelves.
Heidelberg and Geelong- had exhibits of
similar genre. The Malvernites went to the
fairy tales for inspiration, and presented the
home of the Three Bears, a wee bedroom
and dining-room, with Goldilocks being gazed
at by Littlest Bear. Beautiful little hook
rugs and patchwork quilts were there, and
even hot-water bags for the ursine trio.
The Stradbroke Cup went to the Shepparton
Guides, who clustered their exhibits round
the tale of the Three Little Foxes, whose
adventures are told in verse by A. A. Milne.
There was a collection of toys, including
such animals as kangaroos, elephants
and monkeys, and, of course, foxes. Ber-
wick, Beaconsfield, Pakenham and Drouin
united in the staging of Red Riding Hood.
The camping settings were very effective,
and the makeshift furnishings, utensils for
cooking and the like showed great ingenuity.
The crippled children of the Frankston
Orthopaedic Hospital, who belong to the
G.G.A.. no doubt found a lot of happiness
in making tlieir exhibit, in which old boxes
and other odds and ends were evolved into
furniture for a doll’s house. The Mildura
Guides did a model of an irrigated orchard;
and a lone Guide set an equally clever repre-
sentation of a farm.
The show was launched hv Governor
Irvine’s lady, who was escorted round
by General Cliauvel’s wife, Deputy-Com-
missioner of the G.G.A. Lud Mayor
Gengoult Smith thanked the Irvine lady
for her interest. The organising com-
mittee Of the exhibition was headed by Mrs.
Frank Faulkner, District Commissioner for
the Southern Suburbs, and Hatty Alexander,
District Commissioner for South and Port
Melbourne, was secretary.
There was a garden-party at Bishops-
court, Archbishop Head’s residence, in aid
of St. Hilda’s Training Home. The weather
was fine, and plastic and classic dancing by
pupils of St. Catherine’s School, Toorak.
was watched in pleasant circumstances. The
Archbishop launched the party, and Mrs.
Head, who also welcomed the guests, was
given a posy by the'organising committee.
She and Mrs. R. M. Weldon were the chief
engineers of the effort, which included a
bazaar.
Mrs. Ernest Poolman put on a bridge
party at her home at South Yarra to help
the Victoria League’s bush libraries. There
were close on 200 players. Afternoon tea
was served in the garden, where there were
.several bazaar stalls. Mrs. Moffatt Clarke
threw open her house for an overflow card
gathering. ,Janet Aitken was lion. sec. and
Mrs. James Strachan hon. treas.
Mrs. J. G. Latham launched a bridge
party and sale of work at Lovell House, the
hostel for governesses in Alma-road, the
object of the effort being to reduce the in-
stitution’s overdraft, which stood at £6OO.
There was a parade of horses through the
city on Saturday in connection with the
R.A.S. show. Steele Rudd’s creations, Mum
and Dad and the family, were in the van-
guard iu a battered old buggy, and a coach
and four rumbled along also with a full
load. The Lud Mayor put on his official
robes and took a salute from the mounted
police.
At St. John’s, Toorak, Hope, daughter of
the late medical-knight George Syme and
of the Syme lady, became the wife of Dr.
John Holmes Shaw, of South Yarra, who
hails from Maoriland. The bride’s Limerick
lace and tulle veil, anchored to a wreath of
velvet leaves and orange buds, flowed over
a white velvet empire gown. Her atten-
dants were her sister Theo Syme and four
children —Veronica, youngest daughter of the
Geoffrey Symes; Judith Roberts, David
Clendinnen and Bill Williams. The grown-
up ’maid and the two small girls wore long
velvet frocks of azure hue with white
apple blossom twined about their brows.
The boys were in suits of the same material
as their little partners, with ruffles of white
georgette. Mr. and Mrs. G. R. A. Syme
staged a party at which about 300 guests
congregated.
When Peggy, only daughter of the J. A.
Todds, of Hawthorn, wedded Arthur, only
son of Mr. and Mrs. W. 11. Chambers, of
Rosewood, Rutherglen, she made a charming
picture, her gown being of vellum-tinted satin
and her veil antique lace floating over tulle.
Her attendant’s frock was of ivory wool
laco allied to a large hat of lily-green hue,
aud two small girls who guarded the bride's
train were in Kate Greenaway frocks of
cream velvet, with mittens and satin slippers
of the soft green shade.
Knight George Tallis and his lady are
rejoicing over the advent of a grandson,
brought by the stork to Mr. and Mrs. Pat
Tallis, of Belleura, Mornington. Mrs. Tallis
was Joyce Howes, of Sydney.
The Loreto Old Girls’ Association gave a
tea party at Mandeville Hall in honor of one
of their number, singer Rita Miller, who is
taking part in John Brownlee’s concert tour.
Mrs. J. B. Willis spoke a greeting to the
soprano and handed her a hound Loreto
manual and a posy.
“Tales of Hoffmann” wound np the
opera season. Apollo Granforte and Molly
de Gunst made speeches and hinted at a.
possible continuation of the season on the
co.’s return.from Maoriland. “Madame But
terfly,” performed ten times, proved the
most popular item of the repertoire in this
city.
Theo Shall, the good-looking young Aus-
trian who made his first appearance before
a Melbourne audience in “Autumn Crocus”
at the King’s, struts around in embroidered
shorts. Dorothy Peters, who provides the
other half of the romance is seen in pretty
floral georgettes and a simple little mauve
frock with which she wears an elaborate
shawl. That old favorite, Katie Towers,
looks like a large pink and white doll. She
favors green and white check gingham with
Alpine hat and accessories, and Mona Barlee
as the young lady living in freedom goes in
for vivid-liued blouses and skirts. In the
audience on the first night were the J. V.
Fairhairns, Mrs. Leslie MacDonald, Mr.
and Mrs. Ross Grey Smith, Dr. Nyulasy
and his sister Miss Nyulasy, Dr. and Mrs.
Officer Browne, Dr. and Mrs. Stewart Fer-
guson and Mrs. W. R. Burston. Margaret
Rawlings and husband Gabriel Toyne took
a ’busman’s holiday in the front row R.S.
A Dickinson-Monteath camera caught this

Isabel H'andley’s new play “House To Let”
was performed by the Lauristonians’ Dram.
Soc. at Box Hill. Miss Handley responded
to a call for the author, receiving half a
gardenful of flowers. Frank Faulkner
directed the large cast.
At the Music Club’s concert John Simons
played works by Bach, Schumann, Liszt,
Rachmaninoff and Ernest Toch. Singer
Sheila Marsden, attired in deep amber
georgette, inlet with silver lace, was heard
in lyrics by Schumann, Hugo Wolf and De-
bussy.
At Szigeti’s concerto recital the audience
was dressy, cerise, red and green frocks
making unstudied groupings of color. The
handled Barretts and their daughter Cara,
Knight Harrison Moore and his lady, the
Heimessy lady and her daughter Mrs.
Bernard Heinze, the Arthur Horderns, the
J. T. Tweddles and their two daughters and
Mrs. Edward Stevens were among the lis-
teners.
Tintern Old Girls’ Dram. Soc. performed
lan Hay’s “The Happy Ending” at the
Comedy to raise funds for Toe. H. Robert
Gibson produced the show, in which Sylvia
Scott, Lois Salthouse and Marie James
played leading parts. Staging and dressing
were good.
Mrs. John Mclnerny, who died suddenly
at a dinner at the Lyceum Club on Friday
night, wag the widow of Dr. J. Mclnerny,
of North Fitzroy. She was associated
witli the Ladies’ Benevolent Society for 30
years, and was president for 12 years. For
war-time service on the N.C.W. she gained
an 0.8. E. Another greatly-regretted death is
that of Mrs. Sugden, wife of the Rev. Dr. E.
H. Sugden, former Master of Queen’s College.
She was a great worker for Carlton H'ome
and Carlton Refuge, being president of the
committee of those institutions for 26 years.
She was born in Yorkshire and came to
Australia with her husband 48 years ago.
Peggy Glanville Hicks, who is studying at
the R.C.M. in Condon, has won the just-
established Carlotta Rowe scholarship of a
yearly value of £B5.
’ Weather was cold and grey for the big day
at the R.A.S. Show, but there was an attend-
ance of 54,980, an increase of over 1000 on
the previous year’s count.
Well known to listeners-in is the singer
who looks out of this window. She is Mrs.
Russell Joseph, who figures on the pro-
grammes as
Julia Russell.
She was born
in Maorihmd.
and stud id
singing there
under Madame
Gower Burns,
of (Christ-
church. Then
she came to
Melbourne to
get tuition
from Mary
Campbell at
the Albert-
street C o n.,
and remained
on this side of
the Tasman.
She appeared
as Frasquita in
some of the
Firm's recent
productions of
“Carmen.” Mrs. Joseph is a cousin of
Frances xVlda, still a star in N’Yark’s
operatic firmament. The picture is from
the Dickinson-Monteath studio.
A script from S. Aus.: —
The fancy-dress ball in aid of the S.P.O.A. was
a great success. Mrs. F. Hareus, with her able
assistants, had decorated the Town Hall on farmyard
lines; wheat and poppies were featured round the
ballroom, and the stage was converted into a minia-
ture rural selection. Even the orchestra had donned
rustic dress. A ballet of Miss Nora Stewagt’s
juvenile pupils appeared as wee chickens, white
rabbits, robins and wrens. His Ex-, and Lady Hore-
Ruthven were received by the David Gordons and
the Bruce lady (organiser). In the vice-regal party
were the Premier’s wife, Mrs. Lionel Hill, the Lud
Mayor and Mayoress and Mr. and Mrs. R. L.
Butler. Gold baskets filled with pale pink and
crimson camellias decorated the supper tables, with
a huge centre bowl of deep rose and pale pink peach
blossom. In the ballroom one half of the organ
loft was arranged as an orchard of peach blossom
and the other with forest foliage.
Lady Hore-Ruthven wore a pale apricot georgette,
Mrs. Hill chose a black taffeta flounced to the
waist, and the Lady Mayoress was in beetroot-toned
lace. A fancy set of eight white cats, arranged by
Miss Alice Willcox, acted as a guard of honor on
the arrival of their Exes.
Died in England, at 81, the Dowager Countess of
Kintore, whose husband was Governor of S. Aus.
from ’B9 to ’95. He predeceased her by two years.
The Countess was a daughter of the sixth Duke of
Manchester.
The committee of the University Dance Club
is planning a new idea for the annual cabaret night
in December; this year it will take the form of a
gipsy camp. There will be dancing in the refectory.
The Mayor opened the spring show of the South
Australian Society of Arts. Exhibits ranged from
the picture of a nude lady sprawling upon a bed
to a presentment of a poached egg in a frying-pan.
Captain and Mrs. Alan Dean are on their way back
to India, leaving their son behind at college. He
has plenty of relations in Adelaide; his father’s
parents are General and Mrs. Dean, of Mount Lofty.
The Speck speaking:—
Mrs. D’Arcy Addison is off again to join son
Alick Downer in the Cold Country. She has been
the recipient of many farewells ; among the hostesses
at bridge, tea and cocktail parties were Mrs. C. E.
Davies, the Nicholls lady, Mrs. Tom Lyons, Mrs.
Cathie and Mrs. Addison’s sister, Mrs. Moser.
E. J. McCann was responsible for a highly-
successful concert at the Town Hall, the first of what
it is hoped will be a series at a price within the
reach of all music lovers. Supported by his 7ZL
orchestra, Mr. McCann’s programme of classical
music was a treat, with J. Scott-Power at the
organ, Mary Corvan in her best form at the piano,
Madame Vera Tasma and Mrs. Blair Hay as soloists
and Mrs. Saunders as accompanist.
The “Illustrated Mail's” flying scholarship pro-
vided thrills for candidates and spectators at the
Brighton aerodrome. Three women fliers made their
first essay, Mrs. R. Powell, Miss Rita Grueber and
Miss Betty Sale.
The Motheroraft Home celebrated its seventh
birthday with a party, when much admiration was
expressed for the excellent way the place is run
and the healthy-looking babies. The affair was
opened by the Mayoress.
Hobart and Huouville R.S.S.I.L.A. joined forces
in a ball at the Continental. The Lieut.-Gov. and
his lady patronised the show, the latter in mauve
cr6pe satin. Supper tables were gay with Iceland
poppies and bulbs.
Swanside shivoos: —
Cupid has done some accurate shooting this
week. Bee, second daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Adrian
Davies, and A. W, Marwick, second son of the
Warren Marwick couple of York, have announced
their engagement. Noreen East and the sporting-
star Harry Duncan Stapledon have agreed upon a
life partnership, as have Dorothy Hall and Lewis
Weir.
With a background of brass buttons and imposing
military titles resurrected only for such occasions
the 11-16 Battalion hop was a huge success. The
entrance to the Swan Barracks was disguised as a
dug-out and the regimental hand shook mothballs
out of century-old uniforms to pipe through the
evening. Mrs. Martyn, in black patterned taffetas,
came with the district commandant; Mrs. Manning’s
black gown was peppered with jet beads; diagonal
frills trimmed Mrs. Cox’s delphinium chiffons ; Mrs.
Vetter's beautiful black lace featured a brilliant
buckle at the back and graceful sleeve draperies;
Mrs. Michael Anketell’s choice was chalk-white
satins; gold brocade and jet sequins brightened Mrs.
Strickland’s black gown; Mrs. K. A. Hall, Mrs.
Eric Armstrong and Mrs. Brcndon Garner all wore
black with success; Peggy Watson Williams wrapped
her slenderness in ivory georgettes; Florrie Ledger
wore moonbeam-blue; Mrs. Rex Norrie’s lace was of
emerald hue, and Enid Stephenson was yet another
devotee of black.
Perth Golf Club has dipped into its bank account
to provide a' lounge' room for its associates. To
defray the cost of furniture there was a bridge
party in the clubhouse. The fireplace, with its
smouldering logs and a marvellous show of flowers
in crystal trophies lent by members, came in for
most approval. Among players were the Sammy
Robertsons, the Alec McNeil and the Eustace Cohen
couples, Dr. and Mrs. Hadley and Miss Watkins, the
Hayes girls, Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Ross Harwood and the
Bill Broadhursts.
Secretaries of the Hunt Club Ball Mrs. Victor
Harwood and Edna Smily were run off their feet
answering SOS telephone calls for extra tickets.
The number was limited to 500, and there were
many disappointments. Wildflowers played a part
in the supper decorations, ’roo paws and gold wat-
sonia holding their own with choice garden spoil. Miss
Northmore lent her patronage in a gown of chilli-
red georgettes; Mrs. J, P. Durack was in petunia
tonings; Mrs. Arnold Buntine offset her buttercup
gown with a green and gold turban; Mrs. Hon
Cleland’s tiered black lacc had a green insertion
under the back of the corsage; Mrs. Vic SeeoinbcV
cream satin was caped with lacquer-red velvet, while
her sister Sheila Hayes chose a toilette with greens
predominating; slanting frills upon the skirt and
corsage ornamented Ina Randell's green lace; the
evening’s sole debutante, Audrey Rogers, wore white
and clasped a posy of pink and w hite flowers. Glances
followed Elizabeth Edwards in her pale-pink-
patterned cream velvets, the diminutive corsage sup-
ported with a lei of flowers; also Dorothy Karby in
shell-pink satin, its strappings a-sparkle with rhine-
stones. Mrs. Axel Poignant wore plumbago laces;
Madeleine Barry chose black, Dorothy Stenberg
primrose, and Lilian Earle a caped frock of prawn-
pink ninon.

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Ammon Ra is an overrated animal, but
he could not have been at his top when he
ran third-last in the Quality Handicap at
Moonee Valley. He was having his first
outing for the season; and punters freely
laid the 6 to 4 that MeShortodds demanded.
The race seemed made to order for him.
The distance was slightly more than seven
furlongs and the maximum handicap weight
was 9st. In the autumn Ammon Ra, as a
three-year-old, lumped 9st. 31b. triumphantly
in the Caulfield Futurity Stakes. “He could
win with 10 stone to-day,” it was said.
Yet the son of Limond, after moving up into
third position at the half-mile without
obvious effort, snuffed right out at the three-
furlong pole and finished behind 13 oppo-
nents.
McCarten went over from Sydney to ride
Ammon Ra, and Jamieson was there to
superintend the horse’s preparation. Jamie-
son Avas befogged as to what had gone wrong
with the star of his team, and before en-
training for Sydney by the express that
evening stated that Ammon Ra was a doubt-
ful starter in the weight-for-age event at
Ascot next Wednesday. Twelve months ago
Ammon Ra went to pieces in the Victoria
Derby, for which he Avas a 7-to-2-on favorite.
Benefited by a spell, he came good again in
the autumn, but fell from grace once more
by going out at 5 to 2 on for the A.J.C. All
Aged Stakes and failing to secure a situa-
tion. Will Ammon Ra be relegated to the
list of has-beens? That problem may be
determined if he faces the starter in the
October Stakes at Flemington on Saturday.
It is a weight-for-age race, with penalties
and allowances.
ParkAvood, who captured the Quality Han-
dicap at eights, vanquished Waterline and
Mollison in the Newmarket Handicap of
1931. Now six years old, Parkwood is an

Bert* "No. Rhubarb Always
1 in the bunch r
exceptionably handsome thoroughbred. He
was bred by E. L. and C. Baillieu, and is
raced by them in conjunction with W. S.
Robinson, who resides in England. Minor
places in the Quality Handicap were filled
by the Derby colts Liberal and Vauntry.
Near the straight entrance it looked as if
Liberal would take the spoils, but he failed
by a neck to overhaul Frank Musgrave’s can-
didate. Liberal came in for a fair amount
of support, but odds of 33 to 1 went begging
in the case of Vauntry, who finished very
strongly, less than a length farther off. D.
.1. Price, who trains the son of Heroic, has
every reason to expect that Vauntry will
turn the tables on Kuvera if they meet in
the Victoria Derby. Stamina never has
seemed one of the attributes of Parkwood,
but he was entered for the two Cups and
survived first acceptances for the Caulfield
Cup, in which he is weighted at Bst. 121 b.
Casque d'Or was second favorite for the
Quality Handicap, but experienced a shock-
ing passage. Strangely enough Casque
d'Or was Duncan’s only mount during the
afternoon.
It must be a source of regret to Harry
Freedman that he withdrew Scalpel from
the Cups. This son of Treclare has struck
a rich vein of form, and registered his third
successive victory in the first division of the
Merrie Trial. He was at the tail-end of
the field half a mile from home on the
middle-distance journey, yet won with a lot
in hand. Silverton, winner of the second
division, is by Silvius; he was fortunate
to beat the Orleigh Park candidate, Lucky
Saint. By running third in the Tullamarine
Handicap, a race for apprentice riders,,
Picatus did not disgrace himself, but the
form did not say a great deal for his .Caul-
field Cup chance. Glideaway, the winner, is
trained by Cecil Godby, and has surprised
his connections of late. Godby did not think
it work while to nominate the Great Star
stallion for either Cup. Hathalie, owned by
the trainer of Liberal, won the Ailsa Handi-
cap sprint very easily, and Tezpur had an
equally effortless task in the steeplechase,
11., Inkson’s riding suiting Gus Powell’s
jumper to perfection.

At the Hawkesbury club’s spring meeting
last year, Autopay won the Flying Handi-
cap, Denis Boy the Rowley Mile and
Winooka the Three-year-old Handicap; and
Strength ran unplaced in the Spring Handi-
cap. Within a month or so Autopay had
won the Epsom, Strength the Metropolitan,
Winooka the Clibborn Stakes and Denis Boy
the Caulfield Cup. It is improbable that
Hawkesbury form will be as good a guide
to results in more important events this
year, for although the four horses mentioned
and other classy animals were among the
acceptors for the Clarendon meeting on
Saturday, they were all scratched in conse-
quence of heavy week-end rain, and the fields
were not of much account. Trenette (6 to
4), who was second to Denis Boy in the
last Rowley Mile, won comfortably this time
from Carat —not a bad horse in heavy going
—and My Talisman. Trenette, who carried
Bst. 91b., has 7st. 41b. in the Epsom, She
has a rather creditable record at Randwick.
Gold Digger (6 to 4), who is fancied in
some quarters for the Epsom, ran a fair race
in the Flying Handicap, and, but for inter-
ference, would have been closer than third.
But it is improbable that he could have
beaten the winner, Kichaka (7 to 1), an
English-bred horse of some promise who has
been raced into form. The conditions were
against Cylinder (9 to 4), who had his
Metrop. weight, 9st. 71b., in the Spring
Handicap; and perhaps the Maoriland horse
did well to run second. Still, his conqueror,
Dalmatic, has never been reckoned much
good. In this race the three-year-old Indra,
who had been backed for both Cups, fell,
broke a leg and was shot; and, Hawkes-
bury arrangements being rather primitive,
it took some time to reach the poor brute.
H'is was an unfortunate career; the only
race he won—it was at Randwick—was
taken from him on a protest.
* * * *
Now that things are improving and the
10 p.c. tax on punters who “pick ’em” has
been repealed, the A.J.C. may reasonably
look forward to a profitable spring meeting,
especially if it gets four fine days. There is
no Phar Lap among the horses engaged,
but those in the first class are an uncom-
monly interesting lot. And even with Infla-
tion gone wrong and Bronze Hawk under
the ban on geldings, the Derby field will be
impressive; indeed, three-year-old form is
decidedly better than this Page thought it
would be.
Maorilanders expect Game Carrington to
win the Derby as comfortably as Ammon Ra
did last year. The son of Hunting Song—
Left certainly beat Kuvera easily in the
Chelmsford Stakes, but Bronze Hawk de-
feated him just as decisively in the Rosehill
Guineas, after having been nearly knocked
down and then interfered with again. Oro
(Roger de Busli —Sweet Alison) came home
well in the Guineas ; and then Peter Pan
(Pantheon —Alwina) downed Nightmarch,
Johnnie Jason, Veilmond and co. in the Hill
Stakes at w.f.a. That was a sterling per-
formance, and Peter Pan is stoutly bred on
both sides of the house; moreover, Pike will
be up. Regal Son, Milantheon, Maltdale and
the Victorian representative, Ruach, are
others with fair credentials, and the stable
still has hopes of Kuvera, expecting him to
improve with racing, as he did last season.
This Page likes Peter Pan.
Rogilia (Bst. 41b.) will probably start
favorite for the Epsom, and on performances
he is entitled to that position. The only
thing against him is that he is a slow begin-
ner. That doesn’t matter much in small
fields, but slow beginners rarely win Epsoms.
Chatham (Bst. 131 b.), on the other hand,
can get up top speed from the start, and,
like Rogilia, has proved himself in heavy
going. Johnnie Jason (9st. 41b.) has the
weight which Nightmarch carried to easy
victory three years ago, and is probably just
as good over any distance. Winooka (9st.)
is a brilliant galloper who ran second in
the Newmarket as a three-year-old; and
then there are Autopay and Pentlieus, first
and third last year—Autopay, at 9st. 61b., has
a stone more; Pentlieus, at 9st. lib., another
pound—honest little Sir Duninaid (9st. lib),
Waugoola (Bst. 81b.), Havering (Bst. 71b.),
Jacko (Bst. 21b.), Gold Digger (7st. 111 b.),
Gold Mag (7sL 21b.) and New King (7st.).
A finer lot of milers has seldom been seen.
It takes a good three-year-old to win the
Doncaster, and a Doncaster winner must
be accounted nicely handicapped in the en-
suing Epsom with Bst. 21b., particularly if he
has shown form in the meantime. But
Jacko doesn’t care for heavy going, and his
preparation has been interrupted on that
account; so The Bulletin’s vote will go
to Chatham, to whom these objections do not
apply.
Nightmarch, after his Epsom triumph, was
a close second in the Metropolitan. A good
many people expect Rogilia to go one
better. A 101 b. penalty would bring his
Metrop. weight up to Bst. 91b.; and the han-
dicapper could make it less than 101 b. if he
pleased. However, Nightmarch was a proved
stayer, and a mile is as far as Rogilia has
travelled with success. He certainly finishes
strongly in sprints, but it is a risky busi-
ness backing a horse for the Metrop. whose
stamina has to be taken on trust. Veilmond
(lOst. lib.) will not be troubled by the dis-
tance; nor will Concentrate (9st. 51b.),
Strength (Bst. 101 b.), Satmoth (Bst. 61b.),
or Salvador (7st. 21b.). Moreover, Cylinder
(9st. 71b.), Historic (9st. 61b.), Denis
Boy (Bst. 61b.) and Lough Neagh (Bst.
21b.) have won at a mile and a half.
Pretzel (Bst. 21b.) was second in the
Bond Cup, same distance, and Gold
Mag (7st. 21b.), a four-year-old, who is
improving with racing, was running on at the
end of a mile and a quarter—he has won
three races in Sydney well. And Circus Star
(7st. 21b.) captured the Newcastle Cup, 11
furlongs—as Strength did before his suc-
cess in the Metrop. last year. Satmoth ran
away with the Anniversary Handicap in
fast time (2min. and was then put
aside for this race. Like Polycletan and
Cragford in their years, he captured the
Rosehill Cup, and he seems likely to go on
and do as they did. Pretzel’s chance is good,
and no one will be surprised at anything
Salvador may do. The best outsider is per-
haps Circus Star. Fancies for the first and
second days:—
Trial Stakes: Topical or Babili (same
stable) ; next, Greenoak.
Spring Stakes: Nightmarch; next, Veil-
mond.
Epsom: Chatham, 1; Jacko, 2; Johnnie
Jason, 3.
Kensington Handicap: Kichaka; next,
Trevallion.
Metrop.: Satmoth, 1; Pretzel, 2; Salva-
dor, 3.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
“Better than Jerry Jerome,” is the ver-
dict of good judges on Ron Richards, an
abo. middleweight who has been carrying all
before him in his native Queensland. In
Brisbane on Saturday night Richards de-
cisively outpointed Tony Gora, who put up
those good fights in Sydney against Palmer,
Chastain and Hintz. Richards is to be
brought to the south if the Aborigines
Department is willing.

Ern Evans (Bst. and Jackie
McDonald (Bst. 71b.) were to have fought
at Leichhardt for the bantamweight charm
pionship, held by Evans, and worth fully
seven and six, but McDonald weighed a
pound over the limit. Three-minute rounds
suited Evans and he was an easy winner on
points. Billy Murphy (Bst. 121 b.) landed
his left persistently on Bobby Lee (Bst. 121 b.)
in a 12-rounder for the N. S. Wales feather-
weight championship (estimated value, three
and six), but the referee held that Robert
was entitled to a draw.
* 4s * *
For a change, plenty of real wrestling
was seen in the Leichhardt match between
King Elliott and Walter Browning. A
reverse short-arm scissors trapped Elliott in
the third round. He, got even with a king-
pin hold in the fifth, and apparently, won on
points, but, as is usual when falls are even
at Leichhardt, the decision was a draw.
Footbrawl
The last grade match of the N.S.W. Rugby
League season, the “grand final,” was played
between South Sydney and Western Suburbs
at the Sports Ground on Saturday in vil-
lainous weather. South Sydney, hopelessly
beaten by the Westerners the previous
Saturday on the same muddy ground, won
by 19-12 after leading 9-2 at half-time. The
lack of enterprise, combined with ragged
defence, which brought it defeat in the
previous match was entirely absent. The
fast breaking of the Southern forwards
from the scrum went far to rattle the
Western back division, and was largely
responsible for the win. The Southern backs,
with Why and Spillane particularly pro-
minent, were a reincarnated crowd by com-
parison with their showing in the final.
W. Brogan and Cornwell were the pick of
the good Western vanguard. Half-back
Mead was in rare form among the losing
backs. South Sydney scored 3 tries to 2,
but hoisted 5 goals, 4 by Wearing. AVest
crossed twice, Mead kicking three goals.
This is South' Sydney’s eleventh premier-
ship.
* * * *
Apparently the prospect of a poor game
kept many away from the Melbourne ground
on Saturday, for only 46,447 persons watched
the Carlton-Collingwood final, paying £2197
for the privilege. Play was fast and clever
up to half-time; after that Carlton settled
down to strong, vimful drives that left the
Magpies standing. Collingwood’s forwards
were good, but they were checked by mus-
cular, determined backs who held them safe.
On the other hand, Carlton’s front division,
Crisp, Vallence and Shea, met with com-
paratively feeble opposition and goals came
quickly—lo to Carlton as against 3 to Col-
lingwood in the third quarter. That left
the Blues with a 60-point lead and the case
was hopeless. When the bell went Carlton
had 23 goals 19 heliinds (157 points) to Col-
lingwood’s 11 goals 16 behinds (82 points).
Besides the forwards mentioned, Gilby,
Davey and Gill were most effective for the
winners, and Regan, Andrew, Syd and Gor-
don Coventry for the losers. On Saturday
Carlton meets Richmond in the grand final
and this writer expects the Blues to turn
the tables on their conquerors of a fortnight
ago.
Ins and Outs
“Amateur Pro.”: Well, the burning ques-
tion has been settled. The Board of Control
“will not approve of the selection for the
Australian team to‘oppose England during
the season 1932-33 of any cricketer who, dur-
ihg such season, writes or contributes any
article for the press which, in the opinion of
the board, comments on the play in any first-
class match or on the prospects of selection of
a cricketer or cricketers who may be a
member or members of the team.” There is
added a proviso that any member of the
team whose sole occupation is professional
journalism may, with the permission of the
board, write articles. Friends of Bradman
choose to think that the resolution is aimed
exclusively at him, and its publication was
followed by dark threats that he would not
play in the Tests. It is to be hoped that the
lad will be better advised. H’e is a great
cricketer, but cricketers as great found in
1912 that they were not Indispensable. Tin;
player-writer * who is not a journalist by
profession has become a dashed nuisance.
He takes the bread out of trained men’s
mouths and tactless asininities of which he
has been guilty—two Englishmen and two
Australians in particular—have caused a
great deal of ill-feeling. By ruling him out
the Board of Control has done a real service
to the game.

Ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip”: Tlie meeting of the Board
of Control in Sydney last week pretty well
rolled out the pitch for the coming big
cricket season, which formally opens with
the England-Westralia match at Perth on
October 23. The Sheffield Shield tourney
begins at Brisbane on October 28 with a
match between Queensland and Victoria.
The selectors of the Australian teams are
the same as last year—C. E. Dolling
(S.A.), W- J. Johnson (Vic.) and E. A.
Dwyer (N.S.W.). Among the less import-
ant decisions was tlie banning of the use
of resin by certain bowlers. There will be
five eastern players in the combined team
to meet England at Perth, following.on the
match with the'State.'-'Westfalia‘will select
these players and fix rates of payment; Eng-'
land’s last match',in •* Australia . begins on
FIFTY-FIFTY.
HUSBANTI: “Shall I play golf or go on a mystery hike?”
WIFE: "From what I’ve seen of your golf there’s no difference.”
March 10 at Adelaide. At the request of
the visitors, only six balls to the over will
be bowled in the Tests.

“Cash Amateur” : Strong men wept when
the news leaked out" from the Board of
Control meeting' in Sydney that there would
this time be ito cash bonus * for Australia’s
cricketing amateurs in addition to the money
paid them for showing in the Tests. In
the 1928-29 games the players, received .£3O
per match, plus a £lO bonus. This season
tin' lily whites will pouch v only £3O a match,
plus 255. a day allowance , and all expenses
when touring out of their State. The Board
will not pay, tram fares for the players
residing in • the city where: the match takes
place. It will thus be seen that a player
taking' part in all live Tests will be paid
£5O less ‘than-last time—a shocking situa-
tion for an amateur to face. Umpires, will
receive £lO per match, which seems little
enough. Outside their State, they get, 25s-
daily allowance and all travelling expenses.';
The public gets it in. the, usual’place. , For
the Tests- entrance to the ground will cost
25., including tax to the stand 35.; 6d., includ-.
ing tax. Other big games will cost Is. and 25., :

“Top Spin”: As far as the coming tour of
American tennis-players is concerned every-
thing lias now been mapped out to the last
detail. N.S.W. will play three sets of
matches and five in the singles against the
tourists. On present figures the seating
accommodation will be far below the first
estimate of 11,000, but there is always room
for standing. As the Rugby League, showed
in the Sydney Test match against the Eng-
lishmen. “cnee you get ’em in. the money’s
there. They can kick because they can’t sec,
but, bless you, let ’em kick.” Brisbane and
Melbourne are also making special prepara-
tions for the various State matches while
the Australian authorities are supervising
the Tests. To the bystander at the present
moment the question is whom have we got
to set up against the invaders. Possibly
Moon, of Queensland, McGrath, of N.S.W.,
and Turnbull, of South Australia, may put
up a hard kick" before extinction. That is
about the best we can hope for.

“Fitzcray”: The Australian tennis heads,
sitting at Melbourne, have decided that there
will be no more Davis Cup challenges for
two years at least. However, the great chiefs
have been keen on sending an Australian side
to Japan next year, and it may be said that
the matter is practically settled. One do-,
sideratum of the Japanese is that the'N.S.W.'
schodllioy,‘ McGrath, 'shall’'go. ’lt’"may- be.
taken as an absolute? certainty that he will,
but the difficulty presenting itself is. the find-
ing of players to balance him.

“Centre Court”: Jack Clemenger, manager
iof the Australian Davis Cup team,' .paid

“Admiral Blowmetigbt” :’ I have just re-

“The Mcllaggis”: One of the clouds
always hovering on the housetops of the
economical golfer is the custom which pro-
vides that if he .should fluke a hole in one
stroke he has to buy drinks for all present
in the clubhouse. It is an expensive busi-
ness these days at the best of times, but
the fact that the news spreads like bush
telegrams and brings members hurtling out
of town in cars and other vehicles to be in
at the death in the clubhouse is an addi-
tional aggravation; also the caddies tick-
tack the tidings all over the course, and
players hurriedly throw their clubs to the
lads and sprint, for the nineteenth. There
is a movement in Britain to do away with
the nuisance under a regulation by St.
Andra’s. Action of the kind would be ‘wel-
comed on this side.
Car and Cycle
“Torsion”: One of the most interesting
things about motor-cars is the long life
some of them seem to enjoy, though on
figures they should only be fit for the scrap-
heap. A recent instance is an Overland
which had its first spin in Australia in 1909.
The other day the veteran came down from
Bowral to Sydney, some 83 miles, in two hours
and a half. Anyone with a knowledge of some
of the stiff ; pinches on that road will appre-
ciate the capacity of the 23-year-old-car. The
original body, hoods and acetylene lamps I —if
the younger generation knows what those
arc—are ■ still fitted. More' than • that, the
original Dunlop tyres are still ; on the front
wheels. ■ British - car-makers are fond of
saying they build for eternity. They have
nothing, on the Yanks if this old Overland
is any criterion.

• “JJmgeni” : The other day one of the Syd-
ney papers published a picture of a row of
those very early motor vehicles in which the
engines were concealed somewhere —under,
the seat, as far as I can remember—and
there was room for two in the front seat,
with just a steering tiller —not wheel—and
a dashboard in front. Years agone, while I
was convalescing at a 'seaside resort near
Durban, a couple drove up to the hotel in one
‘of these quaint, cars. 'The lady was a famous
Jo’burg widow whom, everyone knew Dv
sight and repute, arid the person with her
was her latest- husband —a third of her age.
As.ethe! caravan ; stopped the lady stood
up and ostentatiously began to remove her
coat, . Something sent the car into reverse
and she took a sickening header over- the
dashboard. Contrary to’all expectations she
didn’t ibreak her neck. That didn’t prevent,
her: telling her husband in good Jo'burgese
that this was .what hc : had tried to do,-since
under Dutch law lie was-; assured of at least
a share”in her fortune. I never see a pic-
ture of those quaint tillei’-steercd cars now
without wondering whether the. lady uncon-
sciously, switched the car into reverse or
whether hubby did it under cover of her cloak.

“Kick Starter”: Though it finds compara-
i lively few friends these days in the Aus-
tralia which evolved it, dirt-track motor-
i cycling continues to draw enormous crowds
!in Britain. In the final Test; between Eng-
land and Australia at Wembley, 54.000 people
saw England the victor by 51. points to 42.
Queenslander Huxley took maximum points
by winning four heats, in one of tnem equal-
ling the track record -of 77.25.ee.. Arthur,
Johnson and Case all fell at .vital moments;
"Sprocket”: Van Egmond, the Dutch
cyclist who was beaten by Duncan Gray
in tlio 1000 metres time trial at Los Angeles,
got some of his own back last week by riding
in a similar race at Amsterdam, when he
lowered Gray’s Olympic record of limit,
losec. by a fifth of a second. It is hardly
worth recording but for the fact that a
returned wanderer who was timekeeper
in some of the Olympic events has given
it as his opinion that Continental time-
keepers ai'e apt to bo “temperamental.” For-
tunately for Gray, the visitor insisted on
being one of the timing party. At the finish
he found that liis two foreign cobbers had
worked out the times in a fashion which
gave the Australian no chance. A firm pre-
sentation of the true figures followed and
after profuse explanations all hands decided
in Gray’s favor.
Miscellaneous
“The Gaffer”: Following on the return of
the Australian Olympic team, the' usual re-
criminations are being bandied sibbut. Tie-
chief target seems to be Terry, wlm'handled
the mighty Jack Donaldson throughout, his
career and was in charge of the last two
South African Olympic teams. ‘ When the
Olympiad was over. Terry, as - Ms agreement
with the Australian authorities permitted,
left fpr South Africa, where lie . has. large
business interests. The malcontents claim
that he. should have returned' to Aus-
tralia to give the authorities the benefit of
his experiences." It is difficult to see why.
The manager of the team has stated that ln-
lias brought back a voluminous written report
by Terry dealing with hvery aspect of the
Olympiad and the training methods.

C. B. St. John; recently dead in Brisbane,
was a notable athlete who rose superior to
circumstances.- Minus his right hand from
birth, he became a good club bowler and played
fullback for Queensland against N.S.W. in
1903-04, almost certainly the only one-handed
man who • ever played R.U. football.' . Bis
greatest success was at tennis, and for
years lie represented the State in iuter-Stale
matches, -while-he was many times champion
of Queensland. When serving, he : held tin-
balls against his chest with his deformed arm.
and by some curious bit of legerdemain tossed
them high in the air for the service, bin
only one at a time. Many of his opponents
used to say this curious trick disconcerted
them, but it did not detract in the least
from the high standard of- St. John s tennis.

“Splash”: One of the big surprises at tfe
Olympiad was the overwhelming success ol
the Japanese swimmers. Charlton’s descrip-
tion of their style is interesting. He says
the so-called Japanese stroke adapta-

’ originally \ derived from the Australian
crawl; Swimming high in the water, the
Japs keep .both hands beneath it, while the
leg-beat is perfection itself. )

in length, the tail about 14in. The general
color of the upper surface is grey or rufous,
that of the lower surface white, greyish-
white or rufous. A somewhat similar but
darker species, first collected by Captain
Cook’s party at the Endeavor River, inhabits
north-eastern Queensland. Another species
is a peculiar short-tailed, rock-living form
which is found in the Northern Territory.
Other species are the western ringtail of
Western Aus., the Tasmanian ringtail, also
the recently-described P. cervinus from the
Atherton tableland in Northern Queensland.
Archer’s ringtail, the Herbert River ringtail
and the Sombre ringtail are found in the
Herbert River district in Queensland.
An invalid pensioner in Sydney has been
invited by M.L. relatives to stay with them
for a while at their expense. Would accept-
ance of the offer affect his pension? He
expects to forfeit it during his absence in
M.L. —2092.
When an invalid pensioner leaves Aus-
tralia the pension is cancelled immediately.
Upon return an application for restoration
will receive every consideration, but such
restoration will be contingent upon the ex-
pensioner’s state of health and financial
circumstances.
What substances can be employed to
extract moisture from air? —2032.
The chemical usually employed for this
purpose is calcium chloride. Dehydrated
sodium sulphate and several other hygro-
scopic materials can also be used.
What taxation is paid by white residents,
public companies and natives in Papua? —
2179.
The only form of taxation on white resi-
dents is the imposition of Customs duties.
These, with the exception of duties on
tobacco and liquors, average about 10 p.c.
ad valorem, and there is a large free list.
Under present Federal Income Tax Acts,
income derived in Papua by companies or
individuals is exempt from taxation. In
certain portions of the Territory, where the
Government influence has been long estab-
lished, male natives in good health and be-
tween the ages of 16 and 36 are required
to pay an annual tax ranging from ss. to
£1 for the purpose of creating a fund to be
spent for their welfare.

(1) What, is a Maori “tiki”? (2) What
is its significance? —2o7s.
(1) A small, flat grotesque image, usually
made of greenstone. (2) In Maori mytho-
logy Tiki was the god who formed the first
man. The Tiki charm used to be worn by
Maori women when they were about to
become mothers, to insure that a boy should
be born, and that he should be strong and
healthy. That is why Maoris laugh when
they see a male European wearing a tiki on
his watch-chain, as so many do in M.L.
Hqw to make a non-corrosive soldering
paste suitable for copper and brass? —2oo3.
Dissolve as much zinc in strong muriatic
acid as it will take up. An excess of zinc
should be present, and all the acid neutral-
ised. This will form a thick, oily solution.
Mix lib. vaseline or petrolatum with 1 fluid
oz. of this solution, and thoroughly incor-
porate by means of a mortar and pestle or
by vigorous stirring. On food containers
resin should be used as a flux, as zinc
chloride paste is poisonous.
What evidence is there concerning the
authenticity of the Indian rope trick? —
2025.
Various investigators—Houdini fo>' me —

always third- or fourth-hand.
Who was Pocahontas? —200 S.
The daughter of Powhatan, chief of small
tribes in Virginia. She is reputed to have
saved the life of Capt. John Smith, an
English explorer, when he was captured by
one of her father’s tribes and condemned
to death in 1608. Pocahontas was captured
five years later by Capt. S. Angall, and kept
as a hostage to secure peace with the Indians.
She fell in love with John Rolfe, an
Englishman, and married him. Rolfe and
his wife sailed for England in 1616, and
before she reached London Capt. John Smith
petitioned the Queen on her behalf, re-
citing the story of his deliverance. After
a pleasant sojourn of about seven months,
being received with favor at Court, Poca-
hontas with her husband embarked for Vir-
ginia, but she died off Gravesend.
now To recoior croquet balls? —2021.

turpentine and thoroughly polished.
(1) What type of linoleum is used in
making lino-cuts? Cost and where procur-
able? (2) What class of paper is used for
prints? (3) Inks? (4) Tools? (5) Is
a printing press necessary? —2os3.
(1) Best quality heavy plain brown, pro-
curable at any furnishing establishment.
About 12s. to 15s. a yard, but most shops
will sell scraps cheaply. (2) Depends on
the inks used. Water-color prints require
good Japanese vellum, but for printing m
oil paint or printer’s ink any paper with
a mat surface and without heavy grain may
be used. (3) Printer’s inks, oil paints, or
a combination of rice paste and water-color
or rice paste and dry color. Dip the brush
in the paste first and then one corner into
the color and brush rapidly across the
block; print on to paper that has been previ-
ously damped. (4) Linoleum, gouges,
gravers, penknife, and a variety of small
implements known as lino-pens, procurable
from most suppliers of art materials. (&)
Prints can be made by pressing the paper
well on to the block with the back of a
spoon, by rolling them with a photographic
roller, or rubbing in the Japanese way with
a pad known as a barran.
What is a fathometer? —2148.
An instrument for measuring the tune
between the production of a sound at the
surface of the sea and the arrival of the
echo from the bottom, whereby the distance
can be calculated. The principle was first
suggested in 1912, after -the Titanic disaster.
Wood’s “Sound Waves and Their Uses
(1930) has an excellent account of the
various types of the instrument, which is
now in general use.

Recipe for a waterproof dressing for an
unbleached calico coat? —2007. .
Place one quart of boiled linseed oil in
a tin over the stove (not over an open fire)
and allow it to get very hot. Take 4oz.
common yellow soap, shave it very nneiy
into another tin, and just cover it with boil-
ing water. Set on the stove to. melt, and
when it has become a jelly whisk it
the oil, and leave it standing where it will
keep hot. Dip the coat in cold water, and
when it has become well soaked hang it
up to drain; lay it out, still damp, on a
table and paint on the oilskin dressing,
keeping it hot all the time. Rub the nnx-
ture well into all seams, etc., and then hang
up to dry. When it is quite dry, give a
second coating of hot oil and soap and
allow to dry again, repeating this process
a third and a fourth time. The dressing
may be colored black by the addition of
lampblack to the hot mixture, well stirred
in. Ready-made preparations are on the
market and are much less trouble.
(1) Did Eliza Winstanley, the Australian
actress, write books after she left the stage?
(2) Where and when did she die? —2162.
(1) She wrote many Australian stories,
some of which were published serially in
“Bow Bells,” which she edited for some
years. Her better-known works include
“Desmoro: or the Red Hand,” “Twenty
Straws,” “For Her Natural Life” and
“Bitter Sweet” (which she published serially
in the “Sydney Mail” in 1860). Some of
her stories, which number altogether about
33, were published under the pen-name of
“Ariele.” (2) At Sydney on Dec. 2, 1882,

(1) particulars of hectograph duplicating
process. (2) Its duplicating powers? (3)
Name Qf book dealing with this process?
(4) Where can I obtain material? —2123.
(1) Tlie matter to be copied is written or
typed with a special ink on glazed paper.
It is then laid face downwards on the sur-
face of a tray of gelatine so that, when
pressure is applied with a roller, the ink
is transferred to the gelatine. To take
copies, sheets of paper are placed on the
gelatine surface, and by means of pressure
an impression is transferred to the copying
paper. (2) From 50 to 100 copies are
obtainable, depending upon the quality of
the ink. (3) “Duplicating and Copying
Processes,” by W. Desborough. (4) Swains,

In what way are violins made by Stradi-
varius, Amati, Quarnieri and other old
makers superior to modern violins? Why
can’t modern makers surpass the old makers?
■ —2059. , v .
There are violins made to-day that in
point of workmanship and model are equal
to the finest old instruments made, and
superior in every way to many old ones
by the less famous makers. But a good
fiddle improves with age and constant play-
ing, acquiring qualities which only time can
bring. Hence the value set upon the pro-
ducts of the great old luthiers.
(1) Names of the best-known painters in
Australia who could be classed as members
of the Meldrum school? (2) Is there much

Clarice Beckett, Colin Colahan, Harley
Griffiths, Percy Leason. John Farmer, Arcln-
band Colquhoun, August Cornelils. (2) A
great deal, but they all have the same aim
—the statement in paint of the impression of
what things look like.
How to obtain a gloss when laundering
collars? —2151.
Use a glaze compounded of jib. white starch,
loz. borax, loz. white soap, 1 dessertspoon
glycerine, 1 dessertspoon pure turpentine, 1
teaspoon common salt. Dissolve the soap
and borax in 1 pint hot water, mix all to-
gether, then add Ipt. more hot water, and
keep in corked jars. Damp a piece of
flannel, dip it in the glaze, and rub over
the damp collar, using very little glaze and
spreading it evenly. Rub over with a dry
linen rag, and polish with a hot iron which
has been well rubbed on a waxed cloth.
What are “ roughy” fish? —2181.
They are small fish, about 6in. long, found
around the south-eastern coast of Australia,
their common name being derived from their
rough scales and fins. Though occurring
in shallow water, the roughy is the type of
a family of deep-sea fishes ( Trackichthyidw )
widely distributed throughout the Indian,
Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Several
species of the genus Hoplostcthus are taken
by trawlers off the Australian coasts.

One Punch Palsy
By Montague Grover
Synopsis : Throwing in his job at an
Illawarra coalmine, Patsy Quirk,
amateur middleweight champion of
Australia, trains under Buff Cody for
his first professional fight—with Loubet,
middleweight champion of France,
at the Stadium. After twenty rounds
it ends in a draw. But Patsy
wins approval of press and public,
and breaks down his family's hos-
tility to his new career. • Horace
By an matches him against Chiller
Sniers. Buff welcomes Patsy back to
the camp. Patsy is delighted wlksl
Phyllis Deane, an attractive commer-
cial artist whom lie met through Stan
Carlisle, his artist friend, accepts his
invitation to the theatre. At his
studio Stan shows a drawing, “The
Awakening of Titania.” Buff pro-
nounces it “ ’ot stuff”; Patsy, acknow-
ledging its beauty, thinks it too dar-
inf). Spiers is knocked, out in the
tenth. Learning his opponent had
been fighting to pay off the balance
on his horse team, Patsy gives him
the money. The story spreading,
Patsy is flooded with begging letters.
Chapter XII.
ij * VEN Mrs. Quirk had become recon-
P i ciled to Patsy’s new profession. It
was not that its prizes had converted
her, for she was sufficiently shrewd to note
that, on the whole, Patsy had earned less
than his wages would have amounted to in
the aggregate had he remained at the Keira
Main. Moreover, though her knowledge of
pugilism was small, she was fully aware
that a career, however brilliant, was always
liable to a sudden termination by a knock-
out.
She was reconciled, first, because Patsy
had shown himself immune from the moral
and social deterioration she had feared. He
was just the same joyous, laughing lad who
had nestled at her knee ten years ago. He
had not taken to drink, or crime, or larrikin-
ism or any of the vices which she had
regarded as inseparable from association
with the ring. Socially, he had even
advanced a little. She had always seen
to it that her boys received the best educa-
tion the State could offer, and she taught
them to speak the clean English of the
Irish. To be sure, their accents were pure
Australian, but that was inevitable. It
was Australian on a sound foundation.
And now Patsy seemed actually to have
improved in his speech and manner since
his ring experiences. He was easy in com-
pany, confident in his exchanges with every-
body and anybody, courteous as became
a descendant of a whole battalion of Irish
kings. Patsy, in effect, seemed quite the
gentleman.
He had been mixing in company of which
Mrs. Quirk never dreamed. He spoke much
of Buff Cody, but the name conveyed no-
thing. There were dozens of other names,
though, which meant much to Mrs. Quirk
—names of barristers and doctors and mini-
sters of the Crown and big sporting men
and writers and artists. She had read of
these people for years, but never in her
wildest dreams had she expected that her
son would become acquainted with them.
And the best of it was that Patsy’s head
was not turned. He was just the same
dear little Patsy. The great men who had
sought his acquaintance and had spoken
with him were no more to Patsy than the
rest —some of them, it must be admitted,
to their surprise—not nearly so much as
Stan and Jimmy and his other old Illawarra
mates; not nearly so much as that delight-
ful, affectionate, sentimental ruffian, Buff
Cody, if the truth be told.
Mrs. Quirk eventually met Buff and
thought most highly of him; not of his
social qualities, for she recognised Buff’s
humble unbringings—his dropped aitches
grated terribly on her Irish ears—but for
his nobility of nature.
“When I seen Patsy first, Mum,” said
Buff, “I says ter meself that there lad must
’ave a good mother. I seen th’ swing of ’is
shoulders an’ I says ter meself ‘This lad’ll
make a fighter,’ I says. I can pick ’em
every time be th’ way they swing their
shoulders, Mum. You take it from me, it’s
th’ on’y sure way o’ tellin’, an’ I says ter
meself that there lad’s mother must be a
noble woman—not that all women ain’t
noble accordin’ ter my way o’ thinkin’,
except a few, Mum, who’s less noble than
a bubonic flea, Mum.”
“Don’t you go losing yer head, me boy,
over these big guns takin’ notice of yer,”
advised Martin Quirk when Patsy had been
talking about some of his notable acquaint-
ances.
“Don’t you fret, Dad,” he replied. “I
know the strength of it. There are some
of them fine fellows all through. But I
know well enough that with a lot of them,
the moment I stop one on the point it’s
good-bye.”
■ “Did you meet anybody else you liked
especially up in Sydney?” inquired Mrs.
Quirk.
Patsy had it on the tip of his tongue to
tell them about Phyllis, but pulled himself
up. It isn’t possible to prevent people—
even your own relatives—from weaving a
thread of romance into a lad’s friendship
with a girl, and Patsy knew that there was
no romance in his.
“That’s about the lot,” he replied.
“What was the service at St. Mary’s
like, Patsy?” asked Mrs. Quirk quietly.
Patsy went cold. “I don’t know, Mum,”
he faltered. “I hadn’t time to go.”
“Oh, Patsy, Patsy,” cried his mother.
“I’m afraid, after all, they’re doing you no
good there. What church does Mr. Cody
go to?”
Patsy contrived to refrain from smiling.
“I don’t exactly know, Mum,” he answered.
“I never asked him. But you never told
me to go, Mum,” he pleaded.
“Told you, Patsy!” she cried horrified.
Martin puffed at his pipe, an obvious
neutral, but Des set his face hard at the
revelation of Patsy’s lapse. “That’s one
of the things a true believer doesn’t need
to be told. You’ll remember in future,
Patsy?”
She drew him to her as she used to draw
him when he clambered on her knee. He
buried his face in her hair.
“I’ll promise, Mum,” he murmured.
“You can have five fights at £500,” said
the manager of the Stadium.,
They had sent for Patsy. He was ex-
pecting the offer of another fight, but here
was an embarrassment of riches. He held
back a gasp and tried to look indifferent.
“We don’t want to take an unfair advant-
age of you,” the manager continued. “Of
course, if you should win right through,
your share, on the usual terms, would
amount to more than five hundred. But
if you’re beaten, it’ll mean less for us. For
instance, if you should be knocked out in
the first fight, we’ll be about £5OO to the
bad before we’ve done with you. It’s a sort
of insurance policy for you. We’ve got a
lot of strangers coming in—Yanks and
Englishmen and Frenchmen—and you might
wait a year before you get five fights.
We’ll guarantee these within six months
and pay £lOO on each contest.”
Patsy did a little mental arithmetic. “I
suppose Buff’ll rouse like billy-o,” he mused.
Then aloud, “Where do I sign?”
His surmise was accurate. Buff grew
almost lachrymose. He protested more in
sorrow than in anger.
“It’s suicide, downright suicide,” he
wailed. “What’s th’ good o’ puttin’ yer
’ole ’eart an’ soul inter turnin’ out a lad
fit ter fight for ’is life, an’ then ’e goes an’
chucks himself away? Five ’undred quid!
’Ell! But it’s always th’ way with these
’ere pugs,” he went on, as if he was lectur-
ing Patsy before an audience. “Yer can’t
’ave everything, I don’t suppose; but I
never met one yet as knoo enough about
money ter buy a pocket knife for a zack
an’ sell it for a deener.”
Patsy felt sorry for Buff, but his deal
gave him a feeling of independence and re-
lieved him of the spectre which had always
haunted him—that at any moment he might
have to return to his old billet, a beaten
man.
Now there was a clear six months ahead
of him, a well-paid six months. He would
be able to deny himself nothing in reason
and finish with a couple of hundred pounds
—more than his father had ever owned all
at once in his life. And he would be able
to see more of Phyllis Deane. Patsy was
quite honest when he told himself that
there was no romance on his side. Still, he
liked her company.
For her part, the position was much the
same. She felt towards Patsy just the
regard which she felt for Stan. For
neither did she feel the littlest bit of love.
Phyllis had never been in a condition
approaching love. Her fellow girl art-
students—all theoretically, and some practi-
cally, amorous—had denounced her as sex-
less. Attractive she certainly was, but she
had been so accustomed to the company of
men from childhood that they excited
neither terror nor respect nor coquetry.
Everybody knew William Deane by
name; few knew him by sight. He was
one of the old-time artists who just missed
it. He painted many pictures, sold few—
the sales were financial events like the
winning of fights in Patsy’s world. Deane’s
livelihood depended on teaching, and he
was not even a successful teacher. He
lacked one of the first qualifications; he
would tell the proud parent who had money
to waste that the pictorial efforts of her
daughter revealed an utter inaptitude for
an artistic career. After a quarter’s experi-
ence of the youth accustomed to tell lay
acquaintances of the masterpieces he had
dashed off, he would refuse to accept his
fee and tell him, as politely as his contempt
would permit, to get useful work.
A few pupils old Deane loved. He worked
with them and on them as if they were
his own children. Their fees bothered him
not, and, as Fate would have it, it usually
happened that veiy few of these pupils,
whose ability made him both their master
and their servant, had any money for fees.
They were a miscellaneous cosmopolitan
crowd, those who frequented the home of
William Deane, an artistic broth of which
the stock was British, and pictorial, but
which contained the spices of Hungarian
music, French literature, Italian cubism,
Czech anarchism and freak intellectualities
from all the nations on earth.
From the death of her mother, when she
was eight, Phyllis had just “grown up,”
helping her father, listening to the strange
symposiums on Sunday nights, when the
guests brought their own sausages and beer,
forging ahead with a.n education in which
“The School Paper” and “Elementary
Physics” were sandwiched with Moore’s
“Modem Painters” and Boccaccio’s “De-
cameron.”
When she was seventeen, William Deane
was run over by a tram—a method of leav-
ing life which gave his daughter the hundred
pounds-qdd his fantastic estate realised,
instead of eating it up in expenses had he
died in bed with benefit of clergy according
to the canons of the Respectability he
despised.
Phyllis inherited only a fraction of the
artistic ability of her father, but she was
born with a faculty he possessed not at all
—a vigorous practical outlook on life. The
necessity of finding some way of earning a
livelihood presented itself as soon as the
funeral was over, and within a few hours
she had thought things out. She had no
illusions about her own skill with the pencil,
but she realised the obvious—she could
certainly draw well enough to illustrate
catalogues and advertisements. Next day
she got busy among the firms and the ad-
men. She did not know one to begin with,
but she had plenty of confidence of manner
and an earnestness respecting her own in-
tentions which produced a result.
Inside a fortnight she was able to start
a seedsman’s catalogue, which, by working
overtime, she completed in three weeks,
earning five pounds thereby. From that
date she had not known actual poverty,
though she had never been in the joyous
position of a girl who can spend five shil-
lings without fear of consequences.
Phyllis boarded with friends in Bondi
and had a big room with a good light, a
more orderly replica of old Deane’s sitting-
room. His best pictures and the sketches
of his artist friends—some of them valu-
able—had been saved from the sale, together
with his books, and among them Phyllis
felt at home, which she would certainly
not have felt in the room of an ordinary
boarding-house. Out of her earnings she
contrived to follow up the serious art
training she aspired to, and attended regu-
larly one of the city night classes. It was
there that she became acquainted with all
the youthful enthusiasts of the place, in-
cluding Stan. He, of all of them, attracted
her, both the work and the man, and they
became firm friends, working together, help-
ing each other, advising each other.
“If he can only hold out! ” she cried quite
pathetically to one of her girl fellow-
students. “If he can only keep his head
above water till the opening comes! It’s
terrible to think of a man with his ability
—talent, genius, for that’s what it really is
—having to chuck it all up and go back to
house-painting with his father in Illawarra.”
“Don’t you worry about him,” smiled the
other girl. “When a man’s got that much
in him, there’s no keeping him down. You
could put the Post Office on his chest and
he’d be going strong a minute afterwards.
Don’t you waste any sympathy on Stan.
He’s going to be a big man, and in a year
or two he’ll be earning as much as any
artist earns—though, God knows that ain’t
much.”
After a sad lunch with Buff, Patsy re-
turned to the city and ran across Phyilis in
Pitt-street. He waled to her, and
approached flushed and excited.
“Why all this hilarity?” she asked,
smiling.
“Reason enough!” cried Patsy. “I’ve
just come into a fortune. At least, I’ve just
had a streak of luck. Money, money,
money—what is it? What do I care for
money? I’ve got it to burn!”
“No jokes?” inquired the girl.
“Dinkum,” replied Patsy, sobering.
“Honest, I’ve had a bit of good luck. I’m
not yet precisely among the idle rich, but
I’ve hit up a tidy little amount since last
night more than I’d over thought to have
m all my life.”
“Oh, I’m so glad,” Phyllis grinned even
as Patsy grinned. “That’s glorious. Now
don’t 0U f°°^ s h with it, will you?”
“I’m going to be wise first thing,” an-
nounced Patsy. “I’m going to celebrate my
good luck by hiring one of the best cars in
Plizabeth-street, and taking you out to
Narrabeen or National Park or Kuring-gai
Chase or anywhere you like. We’ll have
dinner out there and come back to some
theatre. Just say the word—where’ll it be?”
She shook her head. “I’m sorry, but I
can’t to-day; I’ll go on Saturday or even
Wednesday.”
“But can’t you put off drawing those new
season’s shoes or improved hay-rakes for
twelve hours?”
She shook her head again. “It isn’t work
or I would. But this is an appointment I
must keep. It’s with Stan.”
“I’ll fix Stan,” declared Patsy confidently.
“You can’t. His drawing’s got to be in
for the show.”
“What’s that got to do with it?” he
asked.
“I’m sitting for him—for his drawing of
Titania,” she explained.
“You’re not?” He breathed it rather
than said it. There was a note of absolute
horror in his voice.
She turned aggressively. “Of course I am.
Why shouldn’t I? There’s no harm in it.’’
“Oh, no,” replied Patsy huskily. For the
first time Patsy knew what it was to re-
ceive a solar-plexus hit. He felt the nerves
of that great centre contract and grip
siekeningly. This charming, bright, clam-
antly good, apparently modest girl was the
original of the drawing which Buff Cody
had described as “ ’ot stuff.” It was tragic.
He floundered for words, but could think
of none.
She, in turn, was flushed with indignation.
Her jaw was set and she was in no mood
to speak to him.
They walked on silently, side by side,
till they reached the corner of the street.
“Then you won’t come?” he asked
shakily.
“No, thanks,” she replied with studied
precision.
“Then good-bye.”
“Good-bye,” she echoed, without looking
up or taking his hand.
Chapter XIII.
Stan was at work on the left hand of
Buff Cody when Phyllis ascended the stairs.
There was a lot of meaning in that left
hand. He intended that it should express
part of the emotions surging in Buff’s brain
as he watched the ebb and flow of the
contest. He was so engrossed in his work
that he did not hear the hurried footsteps
until Phyllis burst into the room and
slammed the door after her.
“Stan, have you ever been insulted—
made to feel like a bit of dirt?” she yelled
at him before he had time to greet her.
“Why, what’s the trouble, Phyllis?” he
asked. “Who’s been insulting you?”
“Your friend, Mr. Quirk,” she explained
breathlessly. “And the worst of it is he
doesn’t know it’s an insult.”
“You must be mistaken, Phyllis,” pro-
tested Stan. “Patsy would never insult
anybody, a girl least of all, you least of all
the girls. You’re laboring under some
horrible delusion.”
“No, I’m not; I know. It wasn’t what
he said. He didn’t say anything at all,
hardly. It was how he looked and felt. Oh,
Stan, it was awful.”
“Come, come, little girl,” said Stan softly.
“Sit down and tell us all about it and I’ll
see if I can’t explain things.”
In a few minutes she had composed her-
self a little. She snuggled into a corner of
the more-or-less Mission settee and was
able to speak coherently.
“You know, Stan, I liked the boy from
the first. He promised to be a real pal. No
nonsense, you know, but a real good sort.
That’s what hurt me so; I wouldn’t care
twopence if it had been somebody whose
friendship I didn’t value.”
“But what on earth happened?” asked
Stan, with the masculine prejudice in favor
of getting to the point first.
“That—that drawing!” She pointed to
Titania on the table. “I just happened to
mention that I was sitting for that figure
and then”....
“What did he say?”
“He didn’t say anything—that was it.
Only ‘Oh!’ and ‘You didn’t!’ or something
like that. It was how he said it and the
way he looked. You’d think I’d just con-
fessed to a murder.”
“Oh, that’s it, is it?” mused Stan, relieved
to find that Patsy had not mistaken her
sitting as. an indication that Phyllis was a
girl who would welcome amorous advances.
“I told you never to let anybody know—
anybody outside our own crowd.”
“I regarded him as one of our crowd.
I’ve never told anybody else. Not that I
worried to conceal it, but it seemed such a
trivial thing to mention. Then he happened
to want, me to go out motoring to-day and
I told him I couldn’t because I had an
appointment to sit for you. Then the
trouble came I wouldn’t have told any-
body else, but he’s such an old friend of
yours, and seemed such a decent boy. that
it came out without my thinking. But I
know better now. He’s a prig, a wowser, a
Puritan, a Wesleyan. I’m sure he’s a
Wesleyan.”
“Not a bit of it,” Stan laughed. “He’s a
Catholic. But look here, Phyl. You don’t
know how the outside public looks upon
things we regard as trifling. We’re foreigners.

THIS LARGE INSURANCE COMPANY
CONSIDERED THE “COURIER” TO BE
The Very Best Medium
The Australian Metropolitan Life Assurance Co. sought the most effective and economical
method of making an announcement to Queensland people. They chose-the “Brisbane
Courier,” and wrote us:—
you may be interested to know that those present were unanimous in
saying that the ‘Brisbane Courier ’ was the very best rhedium, for that was the
paper they always noticed in the homes of the people with whom they came m
contact.
(Signed) *‘A. J. HENDERSON.

The “Brisbane Courier” has been “the very best medium” for 87 years.
Ghe
Brisbane Courier
Representative: ROBT. D. FISHER, 7 Jf Pitt Street, Sydney—Bsool.
We not only speak a different language; we
think different thoughts. You’ve spent your
whole life in an atmosphere that’s as apart
from most people’s as life in the Solomons
is apart from life in Rose Bay.”
“But it isn’t as if I was a professional
model—though I don’t see that it would
matter much if I was. But plenty of girls
who’re not models sit for artists they know.
Stella Weare used to sit for dad before
she got married. Everybody knows that
Ruby McFee’s the original of Joe Roland’s
Gallery picture. Why, one night, when the
model didn’t turn up, Maisie Evans sat for
the class
“I know all about that,” said Stan. “But
the people you’re speaking of belong to the
disreputable class known as artists. When
you step outside into the strange atmo-
sphere of respectability, you’re in a new
world. And that’s what you ought to have
remembered. Anyhow, I won’t ask you to
sit for me again, Phyllis.”
She fired up. “I’m going to, whether
you ask me or not. Do you think I’m
going to let that despicable prig dictate
what I do or don’t do? For two pins I’d
do what ■ Maisie did and go and sit for a
class—and take care that he knew, too!”
“You’ll do no such thing. You can sit
for me again, but not to-day. You’re not
fit. You wouldn’t be able to hold your
pose for five seconds. It’s a difficult pose,
you know.”
“I suppose there’s something in that.”
She calmed down a little. “I’m sorry to
disappoint you with my bad temper.
Then, loudly, “Who is this Mr. Quirk,
anyhow—this apostle of respectability and
ultra-modesty who goes round like Galahad,
the pure knight, tilting at windmills? No,
that wasn’t Galahad, was it? But who is
he—Mr. Quirk, I mean?”
Stan looked hard at her. “Do you really
mean to say you don’t know who Patsy
Quirk is?”
“How should I?” she demanded. “He’s
a friend of yours. He lives in a camp at
Bondi with a lot of funny friends, and
he’s been a very nice companionable boy
till he revealed himself a Puritanical prig.
But beyond that I know nothing about
him.”
“Such is fame!” murmured Stan. “And
the papers have been full of Patsy Quirk,
with his name in big headlines. Really, I
didn’t know there was anybody in Australia
who hadn’t heard of him. Haven’t you
seen the hoardings with his name three
feet long? Don’t you see the photographs
in the windows and the blocks in the illus-
trated papers? Where, O where, is the
virtue of publicity? A girl has been toler-
ably close friends with Patsy Quirk —the
great Patsy Quirk —for about three months
and has been entertaining an angel un-
awares ! ”
“Hoo! Funny sort of angel, who goes
round insulting people.”
“And you’ve never heard of Patsy Quirk,
the most promising fighter Australia has
produced since Les Darcy?”
“A boxer?” cried Phyllis, her voice ring-
ing with all the horror she had so recently
denounced in Patsy. “A prize-fighter. Do
you mean to say it’s the same Patsy
Quirk?”
“Too right, it is; how on earth you could
have escaped noticing it I don’t know.”
She stiffened her jaw again. “And this
man, this low prize-fighter, who earns his
living by battering his fellow-creatures
senseless, has the audacity—the damned
cheek—to assume airs of respectability to
me! To despise me! That’s too much;
it’s really laughable. Patsy Quirk, the
centre-weight—is that the word?—middle-
weight, as super-Puritan!”
Stan smiled. “Don’t you think, Phyllis,”
he asked quietly, “that your attitude towards
Patsy’s actions are not so very different
from Patsy’s attitude towards yours? Look
here.” He sat up squarely. “Aren’t both
you and Patsy a couple of Puritanical
prigs—that’s your term—the moment you
get outside your own environment? You’re
just as horrified at his boxing as he is at
your sitting.”
“But I’m not doing anything low and
brutal and degrading. I’m helping you to
turn out a work of art. You couldn’t get
my type among the models, so I came
forward to assist. He’s not helping anybody
but himself—prostituting his glorious body
for the shillings and the applause of a
crowd of low ruffians who delight in the
sight of blood.”
“I’m afraid it’s fifty-fifty, Phyllis. You’re
both intolerant because you’re both ignor-
ant. Ignorance is the father of all in-
tolerance.”
“But a prize-fighter!” she protested. “I’ve
read of them—a lot of low larrikins and
criminals. It’s awful. Why didn’t you and
the others at Illawarra stop him from
going in for it?”
“Because we were too busy encouraging
him, I suppose,” laughed Stan. “You see,
we all belong to the gang of low ruffians
you spoke about—the ruffians who eniov a
good fight.”
She breathed hard. “I can’t understand
it,” she said.
“No, neither can Patsy,” commented Stan.
“That’s what’s the matter with you. You’ll
both take a more reasonable view when
you know more about it. Give you a course
in theoretical pugilism and Patsy a course
in practical art and you’d both forswear
Puritanism for ever.”
“I’m not a Puritan,” she cried.
“You are—the perfect type. I think I’ll
change the name of that drawing from ‘The
Awakening; of Titania’ to ‘The Birth of
Puritanism.’ ”
Chapter XIV.
“If I was the champion heavyweight, I’d
land you one on the jaw, Patsy,” said Stan.
“You’re the two ends and the middle of the
biggest damn fool I’ve met for many a
day.”
“I never said a word,” protested Patsy.
“She caught me with my guard down and
put the k.o. over me. How was I to guess?
She seemed such a nice decent girl.”
“That’s just the trouble. She is a nice,
decent girl, and here you go treating her
as if she was one of Buff Cody’s tarts down
in the ’Loo.”
“Come now,” protested Patsy, “I never
said one word she could take offence at.”
“No; it wasn’t your words. It was your
manner that made her think you regarded
her that way.”
“But I didn’t, and I don’t now. I think
just the same of her as you do. I can’t
understand her, that’s all.”
“And she can’t understand you,” ex-
plained Stan. “Do you know, she never
knew you were in the ring and she can’t
realise it. She looks on a pug as a cross
between a gorilla and a burglar.”
“I’m terribly sorry about it. I did like
that girl. She was so different from all the
rest I’ve met—no stiffness and no g#ad
eyes; just like another fellow.”
“Yes; that’s exactly what she is and that’s
exactly why she acts as she does. You
like her because she’s different, and the
moment the difference crops up you insult
her. You’ve got to realise that there are
people in the world who aren’t bad because
they do things you can’t understand. Also
that there are people in the world, quite
intelligent people, who couldn’t be per-
suaded that you’re not a sort of anthro-
poid ape. Was your sense of modesty so
deeply shocked the day I introduced her?”
asked Stan.
“Of course not. She had bathing togs
on.”
“But go and ask your mother what she
thinks of girls in bathing togs.”
Patsy nodded. “I know,” he replied.
“Mum always thought it was awful, girls
going in like that.”
“Yes,” assented Stan. “She can’t under-
stand how a nice decent girl can wear a one-
piece and show her legs, but it seems quite
ordinary to you. Phyllis has been brought
up among nudes since she could walk. It
seems quite ordinary to her.”
“Anyhow, it’s rotten luck,” commented
Patsy. “I did like that girl.”
Sometimes he saw Phyllis in the street
or on the beach. She would bow, but
never smiled or encouraged him to approach.
As for the surf, she would keep in the
middle of the beach—he saw her sometimes
as they passed—but the Ben Buckler end
knew her no more.
“Why don’t yet git that there Miss Deane
ter come down ’ere same as she used ter?”
asked Buff.
“We’ve had a slight falling out,” replied
Patsy. He thought that explanation was
less likely to excite Buff’s curiosity than
any elaborate mendacity.
Buff glared at him suspiciously. “Yer
ain’t been tryin’ any funny business on
’er?”
“Make your mind easy on that, Buff,”
he replied. “She isn’t that sort.”
“My oath, she ain’t,” assented Buff. “I
know somethin’ about ’em, an’ I tell yer
as any man as’d try any funny business on
a girl like that oughter git shot, you take
it from me.”
“That’s right, Buff!” agreed Patsy, seri-
ously. “Shooting’s too good for them.”
Patsy’s next fight against Billy Leonard
drew a huge crowd—a crowd which did
much towards paying off the whole of the
£5OO the Stadium was committed to hand
to Patsy. It went the full distance, but
there was no doubt as to the result. Every-
body in the building—even Leonard himself
—knew that he was lucky to get through
the twenty rounds and knew that the
referee’s hand would fall on Patsy’s head.
Leonard was scarcely in the champion class,
but he was a good second-rater. Patsy’s
chances of championship began to be dis-
cussed in the sporting press.

Seven Years’ Rheumatism Ended
A Gold Miner’s Striking Testimony
Here is just one of a number of splendid
letters that afford “proof positive” that
rheumatism in its most chronic stages can
be banished easily and inexpensively.
Mr. W. Healey, Willoughby, N.S.W., writing in
May, 1918, says “ 1 have been a miner; my photo
is on the back of every one pound note. I am
represented there driving a drill. That photo-
graph was taken 4,156 ft. underground, at the
Victoria Quartz, Bendigo, which was at the
time, about eleven years ago, the deepest gold
mine in the world. I have been an invalid for
seven years with miner’s complaint and rheu-
matism. About four months ago I had a severe
attack of rheumatism and sciatica. Nobody
knows the agonising, sleepless days and nights
that I went through. At times I could not lift
my right foot off the floor to get from one room
to another. I had to lean on a stick, walk
backwards and drag my foot after me. After
trying several liniments and not getting any
relief I got a bottle of De Witt’s Pills and gained
relief. That was three months ago, and every
night since then I have had eight and nine hours
peaceful and refreshing sleep.”
Later Mr. W. Healey writes : —** / have not had
any symptoms since I first took your Pills. My
appetite is better and I continue to sleep well.”

Mulrooney Forgets to Explain His Visit.
BY STEELE RUDD.
DAD was with Mother in the barnyard,
standing amongst a hundred white leg-
horns, looking on while she scattered
feed to them and pointed out the best layers.
Old Mulrooney rode in astride a huge
draught-horse with winkers on, talking to
himself and flicking the animal with a green
stick.
“Dammit,” Dad roared at him, “don’t ride
on top of the fowls, man! Can’t y’ see
where you’re going, if yer horse can’t?”
“Tli’ Lord help us,” answered Mulrooney,
“is it feedin’ fowls ye’re doing? Good
mornin’, Mrs. Rudd. An’ queer fowls they
would be that couldn’t hop from th’ way of
this ould crock that’s rattlin’ th’ bones of
me, th’ divil taake him! Pshaw, sthand an’
stliop your stumblin’.” And, jerking the
reins hard, Mulrooney delivered tlie ungainly
steed a crack with the stick. But, instead
of standing, the brute half-circled among
the excited poultry, and only stood when he
put his big flat hoof down on the toes of a
prize hen and made a prisoner of her. Then
the squawks of that hen, the flaying and
flapping of her wings in her struggles to
release herself and the cries of Mother
were breathless silences compared to the
roars and the language that Dad belched
at Mulrooney and his “clumsy elephant of
a horse!”
“Pwhat th’ divvle’s th’ matter?” Mul-
rooney squeaked, and hung out over the
shoulder of the anchored hack, like a person
looking over the bows of a ship, to investi-
gate the trouble.
Without waiting for anything further,
Dad threw himself broadside against the
brute, nearly knocking him over, rider and all.
“What th’ devil’s th’ matter?” he echoed,
recovering his balance and pointing to the
squawking hen, now limping off. “That's
what’s th’ matter! And by the Lord, Mul-
rooney, if you don’t get down an’ pay for
crippling th’ hen, I’ll impound you an’ th’
dam’ horse, too, an’ claim damages.”
Mulrooney was astonished. “An’ do ye
tell me,” he said, “that th’ horr.se was
sthandin’ on th’ fowl with meself on its
back all this toime?”
“Who th’ hell else do y’ think I’d be
fellin’?” howled Dad. “Meself?”
“Ye vagabond of a horrse, take that —an’
that!” Mulrooney began belaboring the
offending steed on the neck with the stick.
“An’ that —an’ ”
The brute ducked its head and, stretching
out its neck, blundered further amongst the
fowls. Then Dad bellowed more, and asked
what th’ hell he was doing, and if he
wanted to cripple all th’ dam’ fowls. But
Mulrooney merely kept on chastising the
quadruped, and the quadruped kept scat-
tering the fowls.
Then Dad stopped swearing, and, running
to the animal’s head, gripped the winkers
and pulled hard to change its course. But
the winkers were an ill-fit and, to wa s
astonishment, came right off in his nana.
The horse looked astonished, too. His out-
look on the world suddenly became different,
Seeing a man for the first time on his
back, and using a stick, he took mgnt,
plunged forward, knocked Dad oft his feet
and put the leghorns to flight and confusion,
The sight of Dad on his back and the
noise of the startled fowls brought cries o
lielp from Mother; and, while she stood Htt-
ing her voice, the horse, with Mulrooney
clinging to its neck and calling Waay.
bounded clumsily in her direction. Mother
collected her skirts and fled,
Dave hearing the commotion, ran out or
the barn, gaping in wonderment,
“Cripes, Joe,” he called joyously — here,
come quick, an’ see old ’Rooney.”
Joe came. Then, laughing their loudest,
both hastened to the rescue,
“Boys! Boys!” Mother cried from the
backdoor where she had taken shelter
“quick, before the man is killed!”
But Dad, who had gathered himself up,
stood shaking the dust out of his whiskers
and not caring what happened to Mulrooney.
Waving their hands in the face of the
affrighted charger, and calling to its rider
to “Stick tight, Mr. ’Rooney,” Dave and
Joe succeeded in capturing it. After which
they blindfolded it with their hats and
crooned “Woh, Carbine, woh!” to it while
Mulrooney dismounted safely and ungrate-
fully.
Then Dad, with an unfriendly look in
his eye, strode across and . handed the
winkers to Mulrooney. But neither of them
spoke,
“W-w-what happened?” Joe asked of Dad,
and Dave guffawed: “Did y’ have a spur
on him, Mr. ’Rooney?”
Still neither spoke.
Then Mulrooney, with a frown on his
face, went off, leading the animal, which
had become calm and depressed again,
Looking after him Dad broke the silence,
“You’re like the old man an’ liis ass, now,
Mulrooney,” he called out.
Dave and Joe laughed,
“There never were a bigger dam' ass ’n
ye, Rudd—by hell, there never were!” A:id,
abandoning the horse, he turned back and,
shuffling up to Dad, struck a fighting attitude.
“Put yeer hands up !” he ordered, puffing
and spitting noisily,
“Isn’t it enough to have yours up?” Dad
said, glaring at him prancing around,
“My goodness, they’re fighting each other!”
came from Mother.
“By cripes,” Dave intervened, “don’t you
go too far, Mr. ’Rooney. You better watch
y’self !”
“You b-b-better s-so!” Joe joined in.
“Tli-there’s three of us h-liere!”
“Not a dam’ would I care if there were
three handers of ye!” foamed Mulrooney,
sparring closer to Dad. “Put ’em up, every
maan of ye!”
“Was it to have a fight you came here,
Mulrooney?” Dad roared.
“’Twas not!” yelled the other. “Nor was
it to take yeer dam’ insults, Rudd! Put
’em up—l’m a Ballyhooly man!”
“Well, what th’ hell did you come for?”
And folding his arms Dad looked at him
like a Chief Justice.
“Yes, what were it you come for?” Dave
echoed, keeping a safe distance and a watch-
ful eye on Mulrooney’s flying fists.
“How th’ hell could a maan spake of
what it were he came for when ’twere
insults an’ never a hearin’ he got?” And
Mulrooney dropped his hands, hitched up
his pants and breathed loudly.
“If it was only to ride your horse over
my fowls and tramp the legs off them that
brought you here”—Dad paused and un-
folded his arms—“then, by the Lord, Mul-
rooney, I’d”
“Ride me horse over yeer fowls?” inter-
rupted the other sneeringly. “Pshaw! ’Twas
to ask ye—God forgive me! —for the lind
of a horse to ride over to Fogarty’s to
attiud th’ funeral. But do ye tliink I would
ask it of ye now! Pshoo! Mulrooneys
have indepindince!”
“What?” Dad took off his hat, and the
look in his eye softened. “To go to th’
fooneral, Mulrooney? And y’ never said so!
What sort of a man are y’!” Then to Dave
and Joe: “Here, go an’ get Bess, an’ saddle
her up for Mr. Mulrooney ; and put th’ noo
saddle on her. An’ if she’s been rollin’ in
tli’ dam, currycomb th’ mud off her. And
don’t be standin’ starin’ as if you never
heard of ’er before!” And then to Mul-
rooney : “While they’re gettin’ ’er ready you
better come inside an’ have a cup of strong
tea. It’ll do you more good than a broken
jaw.”
Midnight Rain.
In the midnight when infinity is wrapping
In a black shroud sea and shore,
With the wet boughs at the wooden lintel
tapping,
Like darkness knocking at the door,
Then I listen to the loud-voiced hours,
To the steady beat of castanet and drum,
Impervious, aloof, on the streaming iron
roof,
On the roof, when the great rains come.
A thousand rifts and runnels meeting,
merging,
And all streams hurrying to the sea;
And always through the smother and the
surging,
The prisoned soul of something breaking
free.
Through the silvery assault of blunted
arrows,
The music, the interminable refrain
Of the pouring, pelting water, in the magic
midnight wrought her,
In the interwoven rhythms of the rain.
In the midnight in the ancient hour,
In the earth-reviving flood,
There was ever an old kinship with the
shower
That beat a living measure in my blood.
And now another note is in the torrent,
Another voice among the many hurled
On iron, slate or shingle, when the drum-
ming wafers mingle •
In the oldest marching music in the world.
In the midnight, with never gold or amber
Nimbus of a night-light’s spark,
There’s a part of me that leaves the quiet
chamber,
And goes out, free-footed, in the dark.
In the unleashed savagery, the unpent
rapture,
I have washed me free from failure once
again,
I am futile, petty, tired, but the strength my
soul desired
Is mine a little moment with the rain.
And when at last the drugged mind stumbles
And sinks to the tranquillity of sleep,
While down the night the singing torrent
tumbles,
My slumber is most passionless and deep.
I am carried like a leaf along the current
Of oblivion, past any grief or pain,
Deep and passionless.... I wonder shall I
sleep as soundly under
The wet leaves and grasses, some day, in
the rain.
VICTORIA.
KATHLEEN DALZIEL.
Fog Hounds.
The pad of paws,
White flash of savage fangs;
A cry that awes,
A mutter through the gloom;
Strange fantasy of sounds —
An eerie bittern’s boom, or pack of hounds?
The winter fogs,
Grim cloak of sunny bays,
And nightmare dogs
That bound in ecstasy,
That leap about and twist
And howl in savage glee among the mist.
Hot, panting breath,
Arising from wet tongues—
A touch of death?
The cries, now never still,
Take on new eagerness. . ..
All straining for a kill, onward they press!
The sun is high,
The morning gloom is pierced;
Above, the sky;
Draw Heavenwards the cloaks;
Revealed the morning hunt
As just a winter hoax, the kill a punt!
A silver spray,
A smudge across the sun,
’Tis blink of day;
A ferry, city-bound,
Blows out a cheery note.
A challenge to the hound—a motor-boat!
