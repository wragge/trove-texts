Children and Poetry
I am not a mother, nor even a kindergar-
ten teacher; but I am the eldest of nine
children, and have been a teacher almost ever
since I can remember; and if I had to draw
up a “programme of work” for babes, such
as we draw up for our pupils, it would run
somewhat like this.
First Year. —Verse: Little mother songs
that soothe and lull to sleep, like the old,
old “Bye, bye, baby,” and “Husliabye, baby.”
Prose: Imitative stories telling how the cat
mews, the dog barks, and so forth. By th
end of his first year baby will be hummin
a few notes of the hush songs, and he wi
be able to imitate the sounds made by a
the animals, with charming variations of hi
own.
Second Year.—Verse: Nursery rhymes, be
ginning with the simplest jingles, or the sim
ple;,t lines from little jingles. Baby love
to laugh, and the funny sounds made by th
words provoke him to laughter. For pros
you must tell him stories of daddy anc
mummy and himself (be sure you don
forget to bring him in), with any brothers
and sisters lie may have; also the dog anc
the cat and the horse.
Third Year will bring him to more ac
vaneed nursery rhymes, such as “Coc
Robin,” and some of the simpler songs o:
collections like the Scott-Gattys’ and th
Itentouls’. Arthur Adams has collected th
nursery-rhyme songs in a charming boo
that is too little known.
And now you can introduce him to th
Three Bears, the Little Pigs, the Sleepin
Beauty and other old fairy tales. He Avi
know numbers of songs and rhymes of him
self by this time, and Avill love to repea
them. By the fourth year he will hav
reached R.L.S.’s “Garden of Verse.” If yoi
have not already heard him chuckle over
Little bird with yellow bill
Hopped upon the window-sill,
Cocked his shining eye and said,
“Ain’t you ’shamed, you sleepy head!”
don’t lose more time; and be sure you teacl
him how to cock his eye. And on the day
that he develops measles, introduce him to
R.L.S.’s bed games, rig up a sail to his
“boat” and give him a captain’s cap; turn
the family into his cretv, and you w r on’t have
quite such a tiresome patient, nor your babe
such tedious hours. In the kindergarten
near by the children of five and six are
familiar with “Hiawatha.” Child hands
draw the Avigwam, and Hiawatha and Minne-
haha, and child voices recite those lilting,
liquid lines.
Eight years old! Why, that’s quite old !
Talk with a few eight-year-olds, and you
will realise it. Here is a poem written by
Helen Douglas Adam Avhen she was not
quite eight. Except for her gift of beautiful
expression she is not at all extraordinary:—
Night.
“What are the things that come out of the night?
Answer, child, with the eyes so bright.”
“Why, stars and moonbeams and sunsets red,
And elves that dance on the hillock’s head,
And winds, and whispers, and twinkles bright—
All these things come out of the night.” '
“But one great thing comes out of the night;
Listen, O child, with the steps so light!
When stars and moonlight have quickly flown,
And mist and quiet are left alone,
With a smile, and a blush, and a laugh so light
Morning comes from out of the night”
Many a time, Avlien sounds from the next
room denoted dressing was in progress, have
S heard the voice of my seven-year-old cousin
uplifted in Henry V.’s exhortation to his
army, with my two young brothers of about
the same age joining in the favorite lines:—
As fearfully as doth the galled rock
O’erhang and jutty his confounded base
Swill’d by the wild and wasteful ocean....
Those youngsters gloried in the last line.
When he Went to school and studied Shaks-
peare, this same young cousin told me, he
lost liis love of Shakspeare. I profited by
his remarks on this subject, and when I
came to read “Henry V.” and “Julius Csesar”
with my classes of 12-year-olds, they learnt
to visualise the scenes as vividly as pos
sible, to knoAv the characters and the story,
and to recite together some of the more glori-
ous parts. I used to love to hear the young
voices rise and fall in that prayer of Henry’s
before Agincoui-t:— .
O God of Battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts!
Possess them not with fear! Take from them now
The sense of reckoning, lest the opposed forces
Pluck their hearts from them.
And I have often wondered if that prayer
must not come back to them, to comfort
and sustain. In all this work I had the
warm support of the Education Department
of Victoria.
Lately I wanted to give Bill, a boy of 11
and of quite ordinary intelligence, a book
that lie would really enjoy. I had one set
of child friends gorging on Hugh Lofting’s
‘ Dr. Dolittle,” sending me drawings of the
boat that bumped Africa, and so forth. One
of these children was Bill’s age; but I felt
Bill lacked imagination. Sorenson’s “Spotty,
the Bower Bird,” was ready for an enthusi-
astic child naturalist. I passed it over for
Bill’s inspection, and lie was plainly bored.
Then to my amazement I discoA’ered he liked
poetry, though all my efforts failed to dis-
cover the name of one poem he liked or the
story from one poem he had read. He had
learnt “The Burial of Sir John Moore” at
school. It “wasn’t bad.” But it Avas obvious
that it was of no use to Bill to show me what
he meant by poetry. “The Pied Piper of
Hamelin” was “pretty good.” Personally,
I have found that poem most successful when
it is in the hands of a reciter who can make
its scenes live before the eyes of the child-
ren : but without this it is only “pretty
good.” Bill liked Tennyson. He liked it
read aloud best, but he could not name one
poem nor relate one story from these poems
Bill is quite typical, and the deduction is
perfectly obvious: children love poetry for
its music and for that strange power it pos-
sesses, they find, of playing on their emo-
tions. The pulse of the verse answers to
the pulse of their own bodies and to the
ordered and rhythmic motions of the uni-
verse which make themselves dimly felt even
by children. But the magic of its music,
far different from the clash and clang of
the “jingle” that can only tickle their ears
and provoke to laughter with its fun, calls
to the depths of their being, waking that
innermost being, whose existence has been
but a dim, indefinite sensation, into a
strangely new and exquisite consciousness.
Once I had this actually expressed—child-
ish fashion, of course, but with none the less
clearness and distinctness, by a child of
10. Instead of declaring that one of the
poems he had learnt at school was his favo-
rite and quoting from it as most of the
class contented itself with doing, this little
lad boldly struck out into his own reading
and quoted from “Droving Days.” Then
he gave as reason for his choice this: I
like it because it tells of the wouderous
(sic) things of the wood; it stirs you most
when you read it.” That’s what Bill would
have told me if he could. It must stir you
when you read it. That is why “M.G.S.’s ’
Helen (R.P. 7/2/’24) condemned ‘The
Garden of Verse/’ It was not poetry. It.L.S.
never thought that anyone would ever con-
sider it in that light. But Meredith’s
“Attila”! Now you are talking! I can
imagine Helen lifted on the pinions of those
winged words till she scales the dazzling
heights of Heaven itself, with the magic
of music in her ears, thrilling her child soul
to ecstasy, to return to earth, breathless,
with no distinct images—it has been all too
wonderful for that—but with the glory of
the vision still shining in her eyes and the
music still ringing in her ears. That is
poetry. “It stirs you when you read it.”
ALICE R. VINES.
My Other Selves
How many personalities have you? That
I Have at least three I am very sure. There
is the personality known to myself as My-
self, which usually takes charge of Me and
earns my wages and pays my bills, and
plays bridge and golf and laces up my shoes
and (very imperfectly) shaves my face.
This Me is the person you meet on the street,
a rather forlorn and mournful individual,
usually walking at a brisk pace, with a
dazed return to consciousness as he recog-
nises vaguely some face. He is usually to
be found walking alone, because walking, h
has discovered, helps him to think ou:
articles and juggle with plots of stories anc
plays. The rhythm of walking, too, is in
valuable in working out verse. So if ;
pass you unseeing it is because it is no:;
the primary Me you have passed, but the
secondary personality that I call in to com
pose my plots and build up my verse. Ever
since childhood I have utilised, at first un
consciously and then deliberately, this sub
conscious self to do my poetry and my prose
for me. It saves me a heap of trouble. So
if you don’t like either, it doesn’t hun;
me. Blame the subconscious self.
When I was the tiniest kid I was so
accustomed to a second personality that ]
took it for granted that every child had one
of his own. In those dawning days of my
life my two personalities were so sharply
distinguished from each other that I used
actually to hold a conversation, with my two
personalities as the personae dramatis. Eater
however, I had a violent quarrel with my
other self—it was over a disgusting reply
he gave me—and I never asked him another
question, the mean brute. But as I grew
up I felt he was still there. Unknowing, ]!
called upon him for aid in my first efforts
at verse. It must have been he who wrote
a remarkable piece, of which I claimed the
authorship, and which appears in my first
book of verse under my name. I had no
knowledge and no experience of the feelings
that my fictitious character suffered, nor
could I have. Yet, after three days of ill-
liealth and mental discontent, I was com-
pelled by my other self to sit down anc
write that thing off. After that I felt
better. My other self had taken a mean
advantage and fathered that bit of verse
upon me.
This gave me a clue to the utilisation ot
my unknown subconsciousness. Why
shouldn’t I make him work for his living,
work at my bidding? I found it hard at
first. My other Me used to sulk, just when
I needed his aid. He had no idea of working
hours—no office time for him! Just as I
was dropping off to sleep the confounded
fellow would push into my consciousness a
sestette of a sonnet at which I had been
for days working. He would have the thing
practically complete—he was always a poor
hand at grammar, but he certainly had ideas
and phrases. And. instead of going quietly
to sleep and waiting till the morning to
write it down, my other self would order
me to get up,, find a pencil and copy the
lines he had given me. It was no use put-
ting the 30b off, because often in the morn-
ing it would remain in my memory hope-
lessly blurred. It had to be done then or it
would escape me.
Nowadays, alack! when my subconscious
se -j l ? res off hls lns Pirations at me in the
middle of the night, I turn over, dismiss
the importunate fellow and go to sleep. After
all, a refreshing sleep is of more use to me
now than any poetical masterpiece. For
one thing, masterpieces do not sell; for an-
otlier thing, it is wise to keep that imperti-
nent fellow -111 his place.
I certainly made him work in my working
days. I found out his habits and callously
took advantage of them. When I was trvinz
to build high verse his job started. I learnt
the dodge of throwing my conscious mind
out °f gear and letting my other self go.
I would deliberately slip a cog in my brain'
and brood. It was this brooding that I
cultivated. I let my other self moon about
with the ideas I had given to him—doubt-
less they were Ins own ideas, surreptitiously
injected into my conscious mind. I would
concentrate upon, say, a poem—in those
days I used to write poems—or a plot for
a short story, or an impasse that had cropped
up in a play I was attempting to write. I
would turn my other self on to solve mv
perplexities. I would give him every oppor-
tumty by relaxing my conscious attention
and forcing my troubles upon him, letting
his mind play about the thing.
All these troubles were of the nature ot
a mathematical problem. Out of a situa-

OPPOSITE G.P.0., SYDNEY
tion some result must come: it was the task
of my other self to find the correct and Dnl-r
liant solution. Just before I went to sleep
—yes, I anticipated Coue! —I used to let
my other mind ponder and wonder over the
problem; and while walking the street I kept
him at it. He was not at all reliable; he
wanted his own time; but if I kept broou-
ing on this one topic long enough my sub-
conscious self rarely failed to produce re-
sults, usually at quite unexpected times.
I remember once I had got into a hope-
less tangle over an impasse in the middle or
the second act of my play, ‘‘Mrs. Pretty ana
the Premier.” I worried over that tremen-
dous difficulty until I gave the play up. But
my ghost was a conscientious chap.
morning when I was shaving, with my mind
upon the necessity of catching my boat,
something clicked. Instantaneously the pro-
blem resolved itself into an adorable sim-
plicity. There was the solution, clear and
shockingly obvious. A child could have
seen it. It w r as just the same with my novel,
“Galahad Jones.” Out of a hundred pos-
sible developments I could not find the one
that clicked. And then one day, at dinner,
the whole thing flashed upon me.
When one is as sure as I am that he pos-
sesses a collaborator in his subconscious
mind, it is a shock to learn that there is a.
third personality lurking there. It happenea
when I was down with enteric at Cheefoo,
China, and was left delirious for two days
in that unkind city by a Chinese boy who
was deputed to act as nurse for a forlorn
stranger. It was a horrible time. What
worried me most was the number of Mes in
that one bed. There were three of them,
three Mes, tossing and tumbling in delirium
for hours and hours. The two other Mes
took up such a lot of room, leaving me an-
noyed and worried at the proximity of these
intruders, and futilely striving to get rid of
them. The three of us tossed and raved all
night. Unpleasant company! Next morn-
ing I woke up to a blessed relief. “Thank
Somebody,” I fervently said to myself, “that
other chap has gone. Now that there are
only two of us, we’ll both have more room.
Number 3 had taken himself off —of that
I was blessedly sure. And a day or two
later I found myself quite alone in bed, and
on the way to recovery. I do not remember
No. 2’s departure as dramatic, like the de-
parture of Number 3 ; but I fancy he left
gradually. Anyhow, my No. 2 subconscious
self is back in the old home again, and I’m
working the poor, uncomplaining brute hard.
Why shouldn’t I? I own him.
Yes, but the harassing doubt remains : Do
I own my subconscious self, or does he own
me? Am I, after all, only a confessed
plagiarist, usurping the copyright and the
royalties that belong to him?
ARTHUR H. ADAM.
Du Poissey
When, in 1763, the famous Number 45 of
Wilkes’s North Beiton was burned by the
hangman, it was the great Du Poissey who
remarked that the connection between the
gallows and the press was likely to be an
enduring one; and when, five years later,
the Austrian ambassador was dragged from
his coach and had the democratic “45”
chalked on the soles of his shoes, it was Du
Poissey who declared “Now does the agent
of the foreign tyrant tread upon our noblest
traditions.” No other figure of the whole
eighteenth century possesses quite the glamor
of this remarkable man. He bandied words
with Alexander Pope, yet outlived Goldsmith
and Johnson. Reynolds and Garrick were
his intimates, and the elder Pitt sought his
advice at a time of crisis. But it was his
supposed connection with the famous letters
of Junius which gave him his greatest fame.
There is not one tittle of proof that he was
the author, but much evidence was gathered
which seemed to indicate that the pungent
periods were from the peti of Philip Francis,
of the War Office. Francis in private life
was the most devoted disciple of Du Poissey;
and as there are grounds for supposing that
Francis was incapable of such composition,
the feeling has slowly grown that he was
merely the go-between in the business and
that the real authorship must be traced to
Du Poissey himself. None of these matters
are referred to in The Du Poissey
Anecdotes, which have just been re-
vised and edited by Hugh McCrae and pub-
lished by Abt in Australia ; and the reader
cannot but feel that the preface might have
been extended to include a few dates and to
give us some impression of the tremendous
force which this “wicked old man” exerted
among his contemporaries. Mr. McCrae has
been content to let the “Anecdotes” speak
for themselves and to present them to us in
a manner which for printing and decorative
effect is beyond praise. The ancient wood-
cuts are at times most illuminative; and the
reproduction of the engraving on copper,
which shows Du Poissey in his later youth,
reveals in every line the true character of
the man. This picture, unless I am mis-
taken, is the one from the Lamchester House
collection; but the small painting at Dud-
stone Castle, attributed to Reynolds, might
have been better worth including.
The anecdotes themselves give a very clear
impression of the peculiarities of the wit
which so long kept London smiling. It is
not a precious and carefully polished wit,
prepared beforehand and let loose when the
occasion was ripe, but an easy mirth, bois-
terous in utterance and gently elusive in
■ idea. Take a few examples:—
“Sir,” said he, “I love life, even if it’s only
climbing into bed at half-past 10—in order to forget
all about it.”
Speaking of his childhood, he told me his mother
would often whip him in order that she might after-
wards give him a cake; but she would never give him
a cake without a whipping This, he said, became
bad policy, because it drew him into doing naughty
things which he might otherwise never have thought
upon. He declared that he was most good when
there were no cakes.
“Shakspeare,” he said, “had anticipated a great
deal of what Fielding came to publish may years
afterwards. .. . Their thoughts were upon the same
le v el, and their powers of expression nearly equal.
F. was slightly S. s inferior only where spelling was
concerned.”
‘‘Gentlemen, that fellow over there is the master
of Garrick (the fellow in Question had hurt his foot)
for he combines tragedy with comedy. No man be-
fore could ever play the two together.” Then, as
if in an afterthought, he added, “Sirs, he is an his-
tnomc hermaphrodite.
Sir, there are some books a man would feel
ashamed to be seen reading.” I bege-ed
stance one. “Why, sir; before I begin to X>k into
Boccaccio I always blow the candles out for fear
that anyone might note the color of my cheeks.”
Speaking of children, “Sir, if I had any I would
have their portraits painted at six years of age,
and then send them (the children) to their Uncle
Frackens in Jamaica.” On being asked the reason
f or b j s (j o j ng this, he replied: “Consider... .If they
-were well-looking, I could never have the displeasure
of seeing them grow gawky nor note the gradual
decav of their pristine freshness. On the other hand,
shouid thev b( V ug]y by a single glance at their
I might assure myself well rid of them.”
suppo sing their Uncle Frackens were opposed
f 0 / w - s share of the business?” “Sir, there is no
such person. Their Uncle Frackens does not exist!”
These examples give only the faintest idea
of the Du Poissey character. It is in the
] on g e r anecdotes that his quality is best
developed and the bite and spice of liis
tongue most fully shown. Though, on his
own showing, devoted to idleness, he must
have been a man of remarkable physical
an( j mental activity. Twice in the book we
tmcl him going out to feed his chickens, which
j ie kept in a London back yard in an ancient
bookcase that had once belonged to Charles
jj. -yy c also learn that he fed them on
“crackt maize”—no doubt imported from the
American colonies at great expense.
r _ McCrae has done his work as editor
excellently; and as all the older editions of
t j ie “Anecdotes” have been long out of print,
he has rendered a real service to Australians
by giving the great Du Poissey this glorious
resurrection. Some of the tales in the origi-
na j publication have been omitted. The
i ong an( ] rather wearisome badinage with
Mr. Grey has been wholly deleted; and some
other tales are much improved by
heavy pruning. But why ignore the famous
retort on Benjamin Franklin, which is well
authenticated, and first appeared in Lady
Germain’s Memoirs? Du Poissey had met
j)r. Franklin in Paris, when the latter was
deep in his cups and the noisy Leith had
introduced him as “the new Prometheus who
drew fire from Heaven,” “Sir,” said Du
Poissey, “your lightning may have destroyed
a ver y good crop of hay, but your sayings
0 £ ‘Poor Richard’ make very poor fodder
eV en for trans-oceanic asses.” The virulence
G f the remark and the antipathy for Ameri-
cans that it reveals are well in accord with
the theory that its author was the authentic
Junius. Du Poissey lived to hear the first
ro ar of the French Revolution—an event
towards which his terrible sister Charlotte,
reputed mistress of Cardinal Beaurum-
pier, had contributed her full share. It
seem s a pity that Mr. McCrae has not dug
U p f rom contemporary gossip some opinion
o j f j man on the momentous world
change. Of his death, as of liis birth, there
no surviving record. Mr. McCrae is pro-
bably right in declaring that he lived all
life under an assumed name.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Such Stuff as Dreams Are Made Of
Dreams and the interpretation of dreams
held an important place in early religions.
In our own Biblical record we find that when
a man was impressed by a dream which
appeared to have some special significance he
betook himself to the High Priest, who de-
termined its' value. In A Critical Exami-
nation of Psycho-analysis, by Dr. A. Wohl-
gemuth (Allen and Unwin) the author chal-
lenges the office of the High Priest and
vehemently damns his interpretations.
Beginning with the soul—the psychological
soul, which is “the sum total of psychic pro-
cesses and psychic dispositions”—Dr. Wohl-
gemuth works down to the CEdipus complex.
Psycho-analysis is not, he says, what its
literal meaning purports to convey, namely,
an analysis of the psyche (or soul) in its
psychological meaning. “It means searching
for so-called repressed ideas which are ‘un-
conscious’ and unable to become conscious in
the ordinary way, yet which influence or
determine an individual’s thought, speech or
action.” The psycho-analytic method is
applied not only to neurotic and mentally-
deranged persons, but also to normal indi-
viduals. The lifting of the repressed idea
out of the well of “the unconscious” into the
conscious apparently releases the patient
from its malign influence and effects a cure.
The contents of this well of “the uncon-
scious” can only be hinted at—a sniff over
the brink is more than satisfying. M. Jour-
daine’s astonishment in discovering that he
had been talking prose “for more than 40
years without knowing it” would be merely
an elevation of the eyebrows compared with
the astonishment of the general reader at
learning the contents he has been carrying
about with him for 40 or more years in his
“unconscious.”
At the close of last century appeared
Freud’s book, the gospel of the psycho-
analysis of dreams. In scientific circles it
fell flat; but a section of the public, always
keen on new gods, searched it out and thence-
forth did reverence to the Eleusinian Mys-
tery. Freudian disciples claim that the
work contains all the elements of “Freud’s
psychology.” His critic finds in it much
Freud but little psychology. The gist of it
is that a dream is a wish fulfilment —though
not discernible as such upon the face of it
—and for its interpretation you must look
beneath the obvious. It accordingly distin-
guishes between the “manifest dream con-
tent” and the “latent dream content.” The
former explains itself. It is what memory
recalls of the things and happenings depicted
in the dream: the dream as it appears to us.
The “latent content” is not so easily grasped.
Let us imagine a suppressed wish imprisoned
in the “unconscious.” It struggles to be
free, to live in the conscious. At its prison-
door stands the “psychic censor.” If free-
dom is to be reached he must in some way
be deceived. The “suppressed wish” euters
“the conscious” in disguise. To the unskilled
dreamer he appears to be a decent, harmless
fellow; but under the inquisition of the
psycho-analyst he is shown to be a villain of
the deepest dye. He carries, say, an um-
brella. In the “manifest content” it is that
and nothing more, but the analyst will tell
you that the umbrella is a phallic symbol,
and a key to the “latent content” of the
dream. The fellow is, therefore, after no
good. The dominant instinct in humanity is,
undoubtedly, sex. In the Freudian theory it
is, practically, all-pervading: all things, both
great and small, are capable of being inter-
preted in terms of sex. So with the dream:
it is but a synthesis of symbols built up
from the material of the “suppressed wish”
buried in the “unconscious.” The wish is a
sexual one. fur Apparently Freud, on a bal-
ance of probabilities, considers it likely to be
such; at all events, he interprets it in sex
symbolism. The ingenuity of the psycho-
analyst in the field of symbolism takes one’s
breath away. To his sex-symbols there is no
end. Lamp posts, electric standards,
telegraph posts, sticks, umbrellas, knives,
daggers and so on are phallic symbols, while
rooms, boxes, trunks, tins and the rest com-
plement them in other-sex symbols.
Dr. Wohlgemuth is frank. He says: "I
must confess, to my everlasting shame, that
I, too, was captivated by Freud’s earlier
writings. The breakaway came at the read-
ing of Freud’s paper on “The Fancy and the
Dreams in W. Jensen’s Gradiva.’ ” “Gra-
diva” is a well-known novel'“by one of Freud’s
compatriots. The hero was much given to
dreams. His life, of course, was fiction, and
his dreams equally so. Yet Freud manipu-
lated the “manifest content” of these dreams
and constructed for them a “latent content.”
“The manifest dream content is there,” says
Dr. Wohlgemuth; “and it is not the conse-
quent of the latent dream content but rather
its antecedent. The latent dream content is
the product of Freud’s own imagination, his
own brain web. In short, it shows that
Freud’s method can be applied to anything,
and one can always get a result satisfactory
to the uncritical.
From this point the protagonist became
antagonist. He opens the attack by raising
objection to the conception of “the. uncon-
scious” as other than neural disposition. He
deals at length with Freud’s contention that
all which appears as a dream is merely
disguise, and is, in fact, the symbolic ex-
pression of the latent content. Symbolic
meaning, and especially so in its phallic
form, is inconstant. “The number of the
interpretations is limited only by the in-
terest of the interpreter.” You make your
own symbols and interpret at will. As to
the GEdipus complex, which comprehends in-
cest, homo-sexuality and other “unsavory
phantasies,” he finds that there is no evi-
dence whatever for its existence in the
normal individual. While admitting that
“it seems beyond doubt that cures have been
affected by the psycho-analytic method,” this
result he attributes to “suggestion pure and
simple and nothing else.” The psycho-
analyst, for his part, says that the greatest
contrast possible exists between the tech-
nique of suggestion and that of psycno-
analysis. The answer to this is that, what-
ever the procedure or technique may be, the
essential aim is to bring the subject to a con-
dition of mind in which he will accept what
is offered to him as the solution of his
trouble. Whether it be a Coue with “auto-
suggestion,” a Hickson with prayerful
urgency to faith, the attitude of the Chris-
tian Scientist or the psycho-analysis of,
Freud, the root of them all is “believe this
and you will be saved.” To quote Dubois:
“The nervous patient is on the way to health
as soon as he has the conviction that he can
be cured. He is to be considered as cured
on the day when he thinks himself cured.”
Dr. Wohlgemuth declares that nowhere in
the whole of Freud’s -writings is there a shred
ot proof—only assertions of having proved
what has never been proved.
This very interesting “critical examina-
tion” is mainly intended for the psychologist,
the medical man and, perhaps, the teacher.
It is technical, but not too technical for the
average reader. If the average reader worts
conscientiously through the book, he will b
inclined probably to take the author s view
if not from intelligent conviction, then with
the pious hope that all our dream children
are not satyrs in the making, but that
of the purity and sweetness of our old it
may be unscientific —fancies still clint,
them.

A CHANT OF ENDEAVOR.
[For The Bulletin.]
Out of the jargon and fret of the new ink wet on the
I turn to the quiet places and half-remembered faces,
To the mellowing softness of ink grown brown 'ii
happy age; ..
For here is an anchor of trust, though the slim
fingers are dust.
Did they sing with a clearer voice, did they write
with a surer mind ?
Often their words are jaded; and their phrases,
thin and faded,
Breaking the rhythm of their thought, have made
their purpose blind.
But being withered and old, their leaves are good
to hold.
Is it but vanity groping for the thing that to me is sui e !
The words of an ancient psalm, heard in the
passionate calm
Of a listening strained and perfect when all the
heart is poor,
Heard from the dead and solemn years, have a
richness in my ears.
Hurried and bustling priest, jotting down words in
your haste,
Did you pause a while to think ere your voice
staggered in ink
Of the strangely haunting phrase that would leave
an old-world taste
Of something greatly sung on the future’s ear and
tongue?
Out of the wildernesses of endless trampling feet
And the pens that walk or caper over the reams
of paper,
Shall something be still left that is healing and sweet ?
Shall a light spring to new faces from long-saved
commonplaces ?
Wearily walks the prophet over the leagues of sand.
He shall not reach Mecca ere night, nor yet t.y
the early light
Of the stars that he knows, for all the scroll in his
hand.
He shall arrive when his heart is bowed —at mid-
night—under a cloud.
Brothers, ye cannot hold men to write your ink in
their veins.
If ye shall make them hear one word in one good year,
Count your triumph of soul more than the prophet’s
gains.
Yet sing as the brave sing, for a word has
a far wing!
There, through the jangle and jargon, the people are
straining their hearts ;
And the ear, trained in plenty, is listening to
five-and-twenty
Songs that cry for a hearing over the noise of the
mart. ...
Let be! They knew not what Shakspeare was bring-
ing, nor heard when Sappho was singing!

Sonnets of Wings and Tears.
X.
Across the wonder of the shining sky
They went afar on wings that seemed like
flame.
The little wondering nations, as they came,
Saw them as gods, lifted by skill so high
That a new glory filled each watching eye,
Straining against the distance, now made
tame
By Daedalus, who wrote his splendid name
On Heaven itself; for men had learned to fly!
Alas, far vaunting feathers! flow the sea
Laughed to the yellow sun to mark that fall!
Not yet were men and stars eternal peers.
The distance triumphed and the winds were
free
Of bit and bridling rein; and over all
The low, still shores were heard a father's
tears.
ii.
Now the air crouches meekly, and its mane
Of wind is tossed no more in idle play.
The stars move calmly on their destined way ;
And all the heavy distance fades again
To nothingness before the wings that strain
A thousand leagues into one moving day.
The broken tempest has no power to slay ;
And all the arrows of the sun are vain.
But in this mastery of human will,
That writes strong purpose on the deepest
sky,
What vaunting dreams at last from Heaven
are hurled !
Wonder is decked with tinsel. No far hill
Has golden houses for the gods that lie,
Cold, naked, sobbing, in a narrower world.-

DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Ballad of Ancestors.
A Sydney street that, smooth and cool,
Twists gaily to Port Jackson’s shore,
Under King George’s far-off rule
Was but a track past Shame’s low door —
A path where Vice and Virtue wore '
The same grey garb: the path of one,
With heart still high, who exile bore
For doing naught he’d leave undone.
Time is of all the planing tool.
The ’track’s a street where motors roar,
And wide-stretched awnings, striped and coo 1 ,
Temper the white glare those before
Reeled under, while the gang-whip tore
Muscles of blackguard as of one
Whose secret song within his core
Chanted the deed not left undone. ...
Was he of circumstance the fool —
Some rustic, dreamy youth who bore
Full-tilt at wrongs glimpsed in the pool
Of muddied politics, his lore
Born of the rune of poems, or
On draughts of moorland moon and sun
Grown god-like, wronged, his heartstrings
tore,
And that not wished undone was done?
Such was my grandsire. On the spool
Of Time, though years have bound four
score
Strong threads since that brute-soldier rule
When the leg-irons bit and tore,
The street that was the track of yore
Is banned to me, for there, hot-eyed,
I feel the lash, while festering sore,
Fly-maddened, screams on back and side!
Envoy.
Friend, co-heir to Australia’s store,
Unknowing why. when Pinchgut's gun
Shall waken sweating fears of yore,
The thing they did, who’d wish undone'.

The Moonlit Tryst.
If you leave the coastal road
Where it skirts the low lagoon.
Choosing night-time for your walk,
When beneath a magic moon
Life is still, and still the breeze,
You will find a rain-worn track
Winding upward through the trees.
If you climb that winding track,
Taking care to pick your way
Over rocks and ruts and roots,
Under gum-trees old and grey,
With the silver of the moon
On their drooping leaves down-thrown.
It will seem somehow to you
That you tread a world unknown.
Yet you’ll fancy that you walked,
Somehow, somewhere, long ago,
Just through such a sylvan scene,
Toiling upward, late and slow,
With a screen of silvered leaves
Round about you everywhere,
To a tree-ringed, moonlit glade,
To keep tryst with someone there.
Then you’ll lean against a tree,
And" you’ll give yourself to dream,
And you’ll ponder who she was,
And to you ’twill somehow seem
That she still lives on, waits on,
With her wondrous witcheries —
That she’s moonlight on the ferns,
That she’s shadow in the trees.
Then a fear of knowing that
Which no mortal man should know
Shall assail you, and you’ll turn
Lest your blood should pallid grow
’Neath her cold, bewitching touch —
Turn and take the track again
To the wheel-worn coastal road
And the lamplit homes of men.

THE POOR CONSUMER.
“1 have never met a Protectionist who would not
shut up like a tickled oyster when asked this ques-
tion: ‘What about the Poor Consumer?’” —-llknuy
Bhaduon, M.L.C., of Sydney.
There are not many Freetraders left in
Australia, and their chief argument is a cry
of sympathy for the Poor Consumer. It
pre-supposes that the impoverished one is
hit in his pocket only by fiscalism. The
truth, of course, is that fiscalism is merely
one of a thousand forms of communal de-
fence,' all of which have to be paid for by
the nation —which is to say, by consumers in
the mass. A really logical Freetrader (and
there were a few such in the early days of
the movement) would object, as Mill did,
to State schools, which represent a bonus
on culture; likewise to drains, which pro-
tect health. Yet when a plague epidemic
appears no modern Freetrader is heard sym-
pathising with the poor landlord whose
premises, if insanitary, are destroyed as a
national measure of protection. The White
Australia doctrine is accepted by Free-
traders equally with Protectionists through-
out the Commonwealth. What is it but a
prohibitive tariff on cheap blood? If the
modern Freetrader had any consistency in
him he would be a pacifist, as Cobden and
his friends were, for armies and navies are
merely walls, built out of the pockets of the
same Poor Consumer who is hit by tariffs,
with the object of preventing freetrade in
territory. Without the British Navy this
country would soon be penetrated, peacefully
or otherwise, by Asiatics, and a similar
fate would befall California but for the
existence of the U.S. Navy. Poor Con-
sumers in Devonshire and Washington re-
spectively are thus helping to finance a
Protective policy which, at a glance, seems
of no personal value to them, though on
closer scrutiny it turns out to be very much
their concern. Freetrade in the punish-
ment of crime prevailed in the Dark Ages:
the modern name for that system is anarchy.
The Poor Consumer now pays his quota
towards a police force, a judiciary and the
rest of the apparatus for the protection of
the peace, and gets his money’s worth. A
civilised twentieth-century community does
not even permit entire freetrade in thought,
and when it goes to war, and especially
when the menace of defeat looms up, the
measures taken to exclude foreign ideas by
means of Censor's Departments are as rigor-
ous as any adopted by peace-time Govern-
ments for the exclusion of foreign goods.
The intellectual consumer, and those who
make money by supplying his mental needs,
are liable to suffer, no doubt. But what do
they signify when the welfare of the nation
is at stake?
* * * *
In brief, the world is a place of strife,
and man only survives, physically, nationally
and industrially, because lie is a combative
animal. Lenin’s Bolshevik message in-
spired many who heard it after the war
for the first time. There were to be no
more wars and no more tariffs; Russia was
to set the pace, and as soon as the other
nations realised the economic fallacies of
militarism and Protection they would step
into line, and the workers of the world
would unite in an internationalist brother-
hood. Cobden’s message of t»0 years ago
was almost identically the same. Scrap
your navy, disband your army and abandon
your tariffs, he told England, and inside 10
years all Europe will follow your edifying-
example. The cautious and business-like
British did not allow idealism to betray
them into scrapping the navy. But they
readily abandoned their tariff system. They
would have done so if Cobden had never
lived. It was as useless, in their then stage
of industrial development, as a knuckle-
duster would be to Jack Dempsey at a
church tea-fight. British coal and iron
ruled the world of manufactures, and no
one envisaged the day when this wonderful
combination would be rivalled, much less
displaced. So long as Britain retained the
monopoly created by her easily-won coal and
iron, in proximity, her policy of free im-
ports gave her an advantage over her indus-
trial rivals, who, heedless of Cobden’s pro-
phecy, had promptly raised tariff walls
against her. Because food was cheap wages
were low; low wages meant cheap produc-
tion and cheap production enabled Bri-
tain to beat most of her foreign
competitors in the world’s markets..
Since those halcyon days Essen, Pittsburg
and a dozen more have arisen. The great
industrial nations —Germany, France, the
U.S.A.—-have solved a problem that becomes
of the first importance in war-time by pro-
ducing most of their own food supplies.
Britain no longer undercuts them even in
markets whose invasion by a foreigner would
have been considered unimaginable a few
years ago; and such cables as this, which
arrived a few days ago. are becoming in-
creasingly frequent:—
An explanation has been issued pointing- out that
the successful German tender for five special types
of locomotives for the Indian State railways was
23 per cent, below the lowest of the 10 British
tenders. It is declared that the acceptance of the
German tender was in accordance with the Indian
High Commissioner's instructions to buy in future
in the cheapest market consist! nt with service and
value.
* * * *
Britain utterly repudiated Freetrade dur-
ing the war, when, largely as a result of
past political consideration for the pocket
of the Poor Consumer, the latter was threat-
ened with defeat by starvation. Bonuses
were offered to city and suburban food-
growers. find agriculture was heavily and
comprehensively protected. Meanwhile
foreign food-monopolists took advantage of
the nation’s desperate plight, the U.S. Beef
Trust, in particular, through its Argentine
companies, making a tremendous fortune by
the sale of meat which the United King-
dom had to buy if it was not willing to
perish. The world is at peace again more
or less, and Britain has reverted to Free-
trade —in the interests presumably of the
Poor Consumer. Yet it is questionable if
the consumer is scoring by reason of the
arrangement. Chiefly because it is vital
for Britain to have overseas sources of food-
supply in the event of another World War,
the taxpayers of that country are paying
265. Bd. per head on naval defence, as
against Australia’s Bs. 2d.. M.L.’s 4s. 7d.
and Canada’s Is. 4d. The struggling Devon-
shire peasant cannot afford to help pay for
the defence of the wealthy dominions, but
lie dare not let them go. He has no parti-
cular love for them, and he suspects that
they have little love for him, but during
the war they stood by him with stout yeo-
men fighters and the food that yeomen grow:
in fact, they provided what his country
had sacrificed by its “saving” policy of
Freetrade. In the meantime, where he is
a thoughtful peasant, he is probably begin-
ning to ask himself if some forms of saving
are worth it. According to the latest avail-
able figures there are 1,185,000 unemployed
in England. Scotland and Wales, most" of
the trouble being due to the ousting of Free-
trade British goods by protected foreign
firms. A special Act of Parliament (the
Empire Settlement Act) has had to be
passed with the object of expatriating Bri-
tons from the land where the consumer’s
pocket is treated considerately, to countries
where work is esteemed rather than cheap-
ness. And, to complete the calamitous cycle,
the very benefit for which the nation sacri-
ficed one of its first lines of defence
threatens to fail. For the Chicago
Beef Trust, after 15 years of effort,
has virtual control of the British meat
trade, and the eventual aim of this
organisation is to control every form of
foodstuff. The moral of it all is that the
consumer cannot be separated from his iden-
tity as a national. The British did not spend
over 525 millions sterling last year (or close
on £l2 per consumer) on war measures and
war commitments out of extravagant vain-
glory : they did it in recognition of
the fact that the world is not the place
Cobden imagined it to be. The Germans
have not subsidised their mercantile marine
to such purpose that, according to a Sun
message of last week, “the Nord Deutscher
Lloyd will be back at its pre-war strength
by next July,” because they wanted to en-
rich a few : their aim is to lay the founda-
tions of another German Navy. Protec-
tion is as essential in the industrial as it
is in any other sphere to-day, and the econo-
mic pacifist who whines about the injury it
may do to his pocket has no more claim to
sympathy than the individualist crank with
conscientious objection to paying his water
and sewerage rates.
GOLD AND PAPER.
As the hunt for loans goes on complaints
about the lack of currency multiply and grow
more bitter: the laugh of the evening-dress
villain in the melodrama was never in the
same street for bitterness. Someone wrote
lately to a paper saying that he fouud it
impossible to borrow £5OOO from a bank on
£20,000 worth of security because the neces-
sary spare funds don’t exist. Allusion was
also made to two municipalities which have
gone, or are going, to England to raise a pair
of loans, because there is little or nothing to
borrow here except weather. Unfortunately,
money borrowed in England stays in Eng-
land, for it is useless to bring British notes
which are waste paper here, and the objec-
tion to parting with gold lias become the size
of a mania. Therefore Australia takes it
out in goods, which hinders it in the matter
of buying local goods and helping Australian
industry, and the interest goes abroad in-
stead of being circulated here. Thus local
industry "gets it in the neck” both ways.
And it is for this reason that a clamor arises,
or is going to arise if The Bulletin can
manage it, for the complete prohibition of
the private export of gold, and the purchase
of the entire output by the Federal Govern-
ment. It would, of course, pay the market
price in Australian paper money, whereas
the price is now paid mostly in British paper
money, and in consequence these differences
would arise:—
(1) The gold would be transmuted into notes of
the kind that serve to buy only Australian goods and'
pay Australian wages. Under the export and foreign-
sale policy it is transmuted into currency that is
only good to buy other people’s goods and pay other
people’s wages.
(2) Both the gold and the paper money would
remain here. Under the export and foreign-sale
method it seems that neither of them is here.
(3) Australia would get the extra currency of which
it is so much in need, and the extra would be re-
markably well-secured currency—better secured than
the old lot.
* * * *
The last statement requires amplification.
The price of gold shortly before the war was
795. per oz. It will presumably be that price
again when the old financial position returns,
as it ought to do, for there is something wrong
with the existing situation. But the present
selling figure of gold for export is about
965., which amount would be cheering if it
didn’t reach here in the shape of foreign
goods, to the detriment of local industry. If
the Government commandeered the new gold
output, which is the metal which now goes
abroad (the old stock has somebody sitting
on it so hard and so officially that it never
leaves), it would necessarily pay this or any
other current price. So 700,000 ounces,
which is about what the annual crop has
sunk to, would apparently cost about
£3,300,000 in new paper money. The out-
put may increase, but the fall has been con-
tinuous, and till the South-to-North rail-
way gives access to new territory suspected
of auriferous possibilities, there isn’t much
prospect. The paper money would naturally
wander into the banks, and would be avail-
able to lend to deserving people who had
security to offer, and thus give industry a
much-needed lift. When the day of redemp-
tion in gold arrived the Government would
find itself about £500,000 out on each year’s
transaction, less anything gained by tne dis-
appearance of notes, which is always a con-
siderable item. But for the year which
ended at June, 1922, the Commonwealth re-
ceived over £1.270,000 as interest on the in-
vestment of the note fund, and anything
which could possibly be lost on the purchase
of the whole new output of gold would thus be
covered 21 times over. And till that day
of redemption in gold, which is a very un-
certain date, the loss would be only a pros-
pective paper event.
Assuming that the Commonwealth pur-
chased the entire output of gold, and that
the cost of doing so remained as high as at
present, which is unlikely, and that the new
issue of notes was merely the amount re-
quired for the purchase, then the reserve in
new sovereigns against the additional paper
money would be 85 per cent. Only a pessi-
mist would regard that as insufficient, especi-
ally as the new paper would merely supply
a long-felt want. At latest advices the
reserve of sovereigns against notes in the
hands of the public, notes in banks, and the
unknown quantity of notes that has been
lost, burnt, drowned or otherwise destroyed
during 11 years, was 47£ per cent. If only
one year’s output of gold, bought at 965.
per ounce, were added to the reserve, and
the notes with which it was purchased were
added to the circulation, the reserve would
be distinctly stronger—about 49| per cent.
The law demands only 25 per cent., and but
for the ridiculous swag of £lOOO bits of
paper which were started by Hughes as a
sort of forced loan, also as a war precaution
and a stroke of genius, 25 per cent, would
he ample. Should there ever be serious rea-
son to fear that real inflation has set in, it
will not be necessary to buy back notes with
gold in order to reduce the issue. All that
is required is for the Federal Government to
have a good surplus on the year’s accounts,
to light its pipe or the kitchen fire with a
million or two of it, and to enter the miss-
ing sum as “depreciation.” If its fears
proved groundless it could reprint the lost
surplus at any moment.
In the days when the banks printed their
own “rag” money, Australia wasn’t troubled
with Such a scarcity that people who wanted
to borrow 25 per cent, of the value of a
good security, and were not particular about
the interest, and didn’t ask how many germs
therertvere on the legal tender, were liable to
be told that they couldn’t have the loan un-
less they were prepared to take it out in fur-
niture or cows. The present “tightness” gets
m tlie way of a lot of industry. In the old
days there was no shortage of what was
called money, and in Maoriland, where the
banks still have their own issues, there seems
to be enough to-day. According to recent
returns the Dominion had, in proportion
to population, almost 50 per cent, more
notes in actual circulation than Australia
has. For this and other reasons it isn’t
haunted with the spectacle of a harassed
Federal Government buzzing around in the
effort to borrow an improbable, if not im-
possible, mass of. printed legal tender that
it won’t print, and won’t allow anybody
else to print.
MITCHELL, OF WESTRALIA.
If tho man could be separated from the poli-
tician, Westralia would have nothing against
Mitchell, its Premier since 1919. His
fine personal qualities are acknowledged by
his political opponents, two of whom — Col-
lieb, the Labor leader, and Angwin, his
deputy—are proud to call him friend. Ao
more likeable character ever led a Govern-
ment to destruction. Only once in 20 years
has he been provoked into a personal criti-
cism of an enemy, and then he amply justi-
fied himself, as everyone but the sufferer
allowed. There is no worse speaker any-
where, but his stumbling utterances have a
certain attractive simplicity and candor, and
he is as honest as the sun. . Such is
Mitchell, the man, as distinguished from
Mitchell, the politician. There will be a
harsher verdict on the latter when he comes
up for judgment on March 22. The very
benevolence and enthusiasm which distin-
guish the man have become dangerous in the
politician. In that capacity Mitchell has
only one idea, which is to put men “on the
land” in the south-west of liis vast terri-
tory. Tile poorer they are the more anxious
he is to make cockies of them (he prides
himself on having found farms for thousands
of workers without any money at all), and
if they are British immigrants so much the
better. According to the Mitchell theory
experience is unnecessary at the outset, for
the new-chum settler can acquire the article
and the Government will pay him—-say, ten-
bob-a-day “sustenance”—while he acquires
it. It is likewise unnecessary that he should
possess funds of his own: Britain has
plenty. Nor must the fertility of the land
be questioned: “the land will grow any-
thing.” Neither do clearing costs matter,
nor crop failures, nor markets—there is a
vague belief that J. Bull, whose appetite is
presumed to be as inexhaustible as his purse,
will consume and pay handsomely for every-
thing grown. In the bright lexicon of
Jimmy the Optimist there are no such
words as “over-production” and “drought.”
A conviction that Mitchell's methods of
settling immigrants are fraught with disas-
ter has had a great deal to do with the split
in the Country party, which has hitherto
supported the Government. This has been
made clear by Monger, president of the
Primary Producers’ Association, who is
stumping the country in support of the anti-
Mitchell cockies —they are contesting 15
seats. Said Monger at Toodyay :
Our quarrel with the Government respecting the
group settlements arose out of our fears that it was
proceeding to cany out an undertaking, which
would eventually run into millions, before details
had been worked out by competent men. The
Government’s developmental methods have not been
conducted cn defined lines. There is no evidence
of co-ordination between its various departments, nor
is there adequate co-operation among its officers on
the works and elsewhere. The fears I expressed at
our 1922 and 1923 conferences will be confirmed by
the Royal Commission now inquiring into the man-
agement of the Peel Estate.
On the Peel Estate, only a portion of which
has been occupied, the expenditure has
reached £711,000, and it is still going on.
The average for the unfinished job is £l4
per acre, and it is reckoned that the swampy
part of the estate will be worth quite that
amount when further improved. But £l4
per acre is low’ compared with the average in
group settlements which are wrestling with
big timber. In the Manjimup district it
cost £29 per acre to clear 1761 acres, and
forest growths wen; removed from 168 acres
in Augusta for £3l per acre. These figures
(official in each case) have a painful inter-
est for the Westralian. taxpayer inasmuch
as, under Mitchell’s agreement with the
British Government, every grouper is en-
titled to a 160-acre farm, “on which the
group shall clear or partially clear at
least 25 acres so that it shall be fit
for ploughing” ; also, there must be a house
(those on the Peel Estate have averaged
£235), fencing and “a satisfactory water
supply,” and while engaged in these opera-
tions the grouper is to get 10s. a day. The
arrangement is that 6000 immigrants are to
be settled in this fashion, and the total
charge, including the cost of supervision (71
p.c. is mentioned), “shall not in any case
exceed £1000.”
A promise was given to the British Gov-
ernment that the immigrants would get 12
months’ training on farms before they were
placed on their holdings. The Labor leader
affirms that this understanding has been
departed from and that new arrivals are
sent direct from the steamer to the groups.
His assertion has not been disputed. It is
as unanswerable, apparently, as another
statement, made by the same critic, that,
although 13,932 assisted and nominated
immigrants arrived in the State between
1919 and 1923, the gain in population by
arrivals over departures was a mere 5155.
Which suggests that the Government’s immi-
gration policy has a sieve-like quality, like
its finance. As to that, Collier points out
that “Nationalism” has accumulated a
deficit of £6,280,000. that the deficiency aver-
aged £628,000 p.a. during the last five years,
and that there has been a loan expenditure
of £11,000,000 in four years (the population
is 35.0,000) without any noticeable increase
in production. It is somewhat difficult for
Westralia to accept a Labor leader in the role
of financial reformer. But the question it will
have to decide is whether it can continue to
employ Mitchell as Premier and keep out
of the Bankruptcy Court.


PLAIN ENGLISH.
When Australia Had a Soviet.
Reflections from New Australia (Para-
guay) :
Shoulder to shoulder, mates, shoulders together,
Hands clasped in hands, my mates, in fair or fold
weather ;
Hearts beating true, my mates, each man a brother,
Building a home, my mates, all for each other.”
It was the chorus of a marching song by Pogson,
leader of the band of the New Australia Colonising
Association. But the Royal Tar had barely reached
the high seas, en route for “The Workingman’s Para-
dise,’’ when some of the mates wanted to shoulder
the boss mate overboard. All at first just because
he said “No females on deck after sunset.” He
had to put married men on sentry-go to see that his
order was obeyed—and then it wasn't. King Billy
b'xu had a rough time with those Dinkum Diggers
of 30-odd years ago. He gave orders “No shore
leave at Monte Video.” They took the French
variety and hopped over the side. After doing the
sights they brought a keg of treacle on board to
give the kiddies a treat. Kaiser Bill threw the keg
overboard and court-martialled the culprits. In the
first place, where did the cash come from to buy tiie
“alcohol in disguise”? Jack Kelly said it didn’t
ccme from anywhere; he had swapped his old hat
for it. He nearly got put in irons for that. Why
bad they disobeyed orders ? Did they know that he,
the Kaiser, had power to send them home in disgrace?
“Old Sam” was glad to hear it, and held out his
hand for the £3OO he had put in. He didn’t get it.
It took about three months to find out that our
brand of Socialism wasn’t going to work. While
tucker was plentiful and the band played every
night, Poggy’s anthem was quite all right. As soon
as tucker got scarce and work plentiful the single'
men began to wonder where they came in. One of
Lane’s mottoes was,: “The bigger the family the
better.” The single men didn’t quite know about
that. They held hole-and-corner meetings and thrashed
the matter out. Old Dad Jones had six kids and a
wife. Therefore he drew eight rations. But he did
only one man’s work. Bill did a better day’s work
than old Dad—who lost a lot of rest—but he drew
only one ration. “How’s this?” said Bill. In vain
King Billy pointed out that the Jones kiddies would
in their turn support Bill when he got a bit stiff
in the joints. “’Struth!” replied Bill; “but I
might be dead then.”
It all worried the young men so much that three
of them got up one Sunday morning and went off
on a burst. They came back at night feeling fresh,
and sang Poo’s anthem outside the King’s palace.
The King had retired to rest, so he sent his aide
out with a gun to remonstrate with his “mates.”
Under cover of the gun his Majesty put his head out
of the window-hole and delivered his ultimatum.
They were dissolute scoundrels, and no longer mates.
They were ejected. Their name was Mud. And if
they didn’t clear out of that, he would send for a
detachment of the Paraguayan army. They didn’t
and he did. He shoved his cx-mates out into the
wilderness on the points of Paraguayan bayonets.

A Tale of Two Bases.
It is significant that in Australia those
who most vehemently affirm that a naval
base at Singapore is purely a matter of
British concern are men who never had the
enlightening experience of a trip to the
AYorid War. They are under the delusion
that almost any old spot can be transformed
into a naval base —that Port Stephens, for
example, is just as good as Singapore from
a strategical standpoint, while it has the
advantages of a better climate and of'being
nearer to the racecourses and other ameni-
ties of Sydney. By a like process of reason-
ing it could have been shown eight years
ago that Manly was a better military base
than Le Havre. The A.I.F. did not fight
alone, nor was it required to arm or equip
itself, and it will he a tragedy for Aus-
tralia if the R.A.N. is asked, inside the next
10 or 15 years, to engage, without the co-
operation of British ships and British fac-
tories, the only sort of enemy that is likely
to attack it. The exigencies of warfare
point to certain regions as convincing
grounds. Flanders has been Europe’s
stadium for centuries. Australia went there
because that was where her fate was being
decided. And out of Le Havre poured into
Flanders every imaginable requisite of troops
in the field —food, shells, guns, clothing and
reinforcements. The ordained cockpit of
the Pacific is the Malay Archipelago. The
oil is there —the oil which gives 70 per cent,
more heat than coal gives, and has already
virtually displaced coal so far as the navies of
the Powers are concerned. If Germany
had seized the Channel ports Australia
would have been doomed. The food and
ammunition supply between Britain and the
troops in the line would have been cut, and
the war lost by the Allies. For a similar
reason if Singapore is not fortified, if it is
not supplied with the means of docking and
repairing battleships, and if it is not gar-
risoned adequately to protect it against any
conceivable attack, this country will be in
deadly peril. Should war come in the Pacific
our destiny will not be decided in a stra-
tegic back-water like the Tasman Sea: the
issue will be fought out in the region where
the things are that matter most to warring
nations. Into Singapore will stream the
stores needed by the warships, just as the
stores needed by the armies of the Allies
streamed into that other depot and half-way
house, Le Havre. Australia will be there
presumably, as she was at Le Havre. While
Le Havre stood she was safe, and so long
as Singapore stands she will have nothing
to fear. Should it go, a chain of bases
stretching from Port Stephens to Darwin
will not save us from oil- and munition-
starvation and defeat.

Before Getting Office— and After.
TnE cynic will find plenty of nourishment
in the remarkable political experiences which
Britain has enjoyed (or otherwise) in the
past few weeks. Labor won the - election,
to the limited extent that it did win, largely
on its promise of a capital levy on the rich.
In addition there was to be drastic reduc-
tion of armaments, with particular refer-
ence to pending cruiser construction and the
Singapore scheme; the rush for oil was to
be discontinued, and the U.K. was to get
out of Persia, where, it was alleged, to have
disgraced itself; India was to be given
Home Rule, and the Versailles Treaty re-
vised in Germany’s favor. Finally there
was a good deal of heartening, though vague,
talk of housing reform, as there has been
before every election in the United Kingdom
since, nearly a century ago, Lord Shaftes-
bury first put his benevolent finger on what
is still England’s gravest social scandal.
Labor Ministers had hardly moved into their
new offices when it was disclosed that the
Prime Minister “neither hoped nor intended
to try to introduce the capital levy, as the
time was inopportune.” Simultaneously
Messrs. Macdonald, Webb, Thomas, Siiaw
and Gosling (all Cabinet Ministers) re-
signed from the Socialist International,
which has been the chief backer of the capi-
tal levy scheme. It was announced last
week that the cruiser-construction pro-
gramme of the Baldwin Government is to
be proceeded with, and there are indications
that the Singapore project is not half so
dead as it looked when the Macdonald
Administration took office. Midway through
last month the Burma Oil Company offered
to relieve the Government of its holding of
5,000.000 shares in the Anglo-Persian Oil
Company, whereupon Chancellor of the
Exchequer Snowden informed the House of
Commons that “the British Government has
no intention whatever of selling.” On the
26tli of last month Lord Olivier, Secretary
of State for India, told the Lords:—
The Government was convinced that the establish-
ment of full responsible government in India would
be worse than perilous, and would be big with
disaster to the people of India.
The Macdonald-Poincare interchange of
views makes if clear that France has no
more to fear from Labor than it had from
Conservatism. And on Thursday last, on
top of an intimation that Britain’s Air
Force was to be “greatly strengthened,” came
this assurance from Lord Thomson (Min-
ister for Air) :
The Government was continuing the late Gov-
ernment’s home defence expansion scheme, while he
trusted that measures would be taken to speed up
research and civil aviation. The policy of the coun-
try, he said, until general disarmament was possible,
should be to make such preparations as would show
that Britain did not mean to be caught napping.
It thus appears that not one of the revolu-
tionary changes talked about during the
elections is to be attempted. In plain words,
Ministers are not going to carry out the
party’s policy. They have adopted some
sort of a compromise, which presumably
they don't believe in. Surely nothing could
be less satisfactory than that. It gives,
in the first place, an entirely wrong idea
of what these Ministers will do when they
have the power: they are liable to presently
win tens of thousands of votes because they
have been compelled by circumstances to
temporarily abandon their policy, and have
therefore not done the things they threat-
ened to do. That they are not doing those
things is not in the least to their credit;
on the other hand, it is not to their discredit
that they are camouflaging their real policy
and carrying out somebody else's. What-
ever party was in power would have to do
that, seeing that no party has a majority.
And that is at the root of the whole trouble.
The British system of Parliamentary gov-
ernment is based on the assumption that,
there will be two parties in the House, and
that one of them will have a msiiority. With
more than two parties it is almost certain
that no party can command a majority; and
yet it has to proceed as though it can—
and indeed if it can’t it must go out. Hence
this system of contortion and evasion which
has been so conspicuous in the British Par-
liament during the past month. Elective
Ministries seem to be the only cure.

Victims of Votehunter, M.P.
No State Government lias been bold enough
to tell the whole truth about its branch of
the soldier-settlement business. Figures are
published from time to time, but they con-
ceal about as much as they reveal. Even
so, they don’t look pretty. In the latest
report of the N. S. Wales Lands Depart-
ment it is shown that £16,910,000 was ex-
pended to June 30 in “settling” 8445, ex-
Diggers, of whom 1292 had “transferred,
forfeited or surrendered their holdings.”
This £16,910,000 was exclusive of adminis-
trative expenses, which were calculated at
£89.641 in 1922-23 and £95,131 in 1921-23,
and amount to about half a million alto-
gether. The land cost £7,956,000, and
£5,634,000 was advanced to the settlers, the
balance being devoted to repatriation, rail-
ways and irrigation works. There is no-
thing in the report to indicate how much
Government money was gambled on the 1292
properties listed as “transferred, forfeited
or surrendered,” or what proportion may
be regarded as irrecoverable. Neither is the
number unoccupied on .Tune 30 given. It
is admitted, however, that “the department
has had to face a very difficult position in
connection with the handling of livestock
and plant on abandoned holdings,” and that
the losses on this account will be “consider-
able.” There is also a statement that “of
£2,702.993 advanced to 6329 settlers
£258,050 —practically 50 p.c. of the instal-
ments due—has been repaid”: but this
leaves 2116 settlers and advances amount-
ing to £2,931.640 unaccounted for. The
omission should be explained. A more per-
tinent announcement is that £330,000 has
been wasted by the Government “in respect
of interest on purchase money where estates
were acquired for group settlement, owing
to the capital values of the various farms
not being gazetted and the holdings con-
firmed.” There were, it seems, intervals
of four, five and even six years between the
repurchase of estates (with loan funds, of
course) and the fixing of subdivisional
prices: but it is confidently expected that
“all the settlers” —especially those whose
whereabouts are at present unknown —“will
be advised of the capital value of their hold-
ings in the near future.” There are many
Digger-selectors on the Murrumbidgee irri-
gation areas, which were run at a loss of
£287,210 in 1922-’23 and of £2,126,503 since
1915; and a lot of Digger-grown N. S. Wales
fruit went into Hughes’s pools, in which
£500,000 of Commonwealth treasure sank
beyond hope of salvage. Neither matter is
referred to in the Lands Department’s re-
port. It is stated, however, that “the stores
on certain soldier settlements” were losing
propositions (particulars are not given),
and that “the failure of the banana industry,
owing to the bunchy-top disease, has re-
sulted in great losses to the Crown, as well
as to many soldier-settlers and others, many
of whom have abandoned their farms.” The
Department of Agriculture also weighs in
with the general information that it has
dealt with another 4080 applications for
assistance (bringing the total outlay
to £2,504,221) “owing to drought conditions
in the country,” there “being practically no
seed in certain districts” ; and since its re-
port was sent to the printer —it deals with
the period from July 1, 1922. to June 30,
1923 —there has been another partial failure
of the crops. The Rural Industries Branch
doesn’t say whether there are Digger-
farmers on its books, but it would be a
miracle if there were not. And here it may
be I'ecalled that the N.S.W. soldier-settle-
ments were started on the principle that
every Ma State ex-warrior not permanently
disabled was entitled, on production of his
military discharge (no other proof of quali-
fication was required), to a Government
farm and to be financed into agricultural
prosperity. A crueller jest w 7 as never,played
on men who deserved well of the country, nor
a costlier one.
The Jingellic Man-hunt.
“H.L.” defends press and police:—
I write to express the feelings of the five Melbourne
pressmen who “covered” the Jingellic man-hunt re-
garding certain statements made (under cover of
anonymity) by “Ax Upper Murray Max" (B.
28/2/’24). Although, among other things, he accuses
us of having assisted in the prostitution of our re-
spective journals, we are not concerned with his com-
ments about ourselves. They amused us, and to that
extent we are indebted to him. It is noticeable that,
although he infers that our stories contained incor-
rect information, he does not quote one misstatement
in support of his charge. We invite him to do so.
B} 7 his statement that we “did not care a tinker’s
dam whether the police did anything or nothing”
he unwittingly pays us a compliment, for it is tan-
tamount to asserting that we were so anxious to
continue working 17 hours a day under most un-
pleasant conditions that we were indifferent as to
whether Batson was caught or not. If for no other
reason, we were anxious that Batson should be
apprehended so that we could return to civilisation.
Owing to the inadequate accommodation and tele-
graphic facilities at Jingellic we were compelled co
make Holbrook our base. That necessitated a 70-mile
car journey over a frightful road every day for
four days. To be at Jingellic reasonably early meant
rising about 7 o’clock. On returning to Holbrook at
night we were engaged “writing up” until nearly
midnight. Yet “Upper Murray Man” suggests that
we are so fond of work that we didn’t care whether
such a strain lasted for a month!
But it is with “Upper Murray Man’s” efforts to
belittle the work of the police searchers that we
are most concerned. In the first place he refers to
Batson as being of “very poor intelligence.” That
is probably so (although he invented a most effective
rabbit poison about which more may be heard later),
but when a murderer is known to be a crack rifleman
few people would be greatly concerned as to whether
he was intelligent or not. His statement that “it
is hardly necessary to add that the police rendezvous
was the handiest grog shop” is wilfully misleading.
We defy “Upper Murray Man" to name a place other
than the Jingellic fiptel which could have been used
as a police rendezvous. Apparently he was not very
closely in touch with the events associated with
the search for and capture of Batson, for he needs
to be reminded that “the poor devil” was caught,
not by “a civilian who unarmed and thinking no
evil was going about his task of milking Straw-
berry,” but by two civilians who, it is important to
remember, had been interviewed by the police less
than an hour previously, and who were not a bit
surprised when Batson appeared outside the cow-
shed. The fact of the matter is that Batson
walked into what was virtually a police trap.
“Upper Murray Man’s” suggestion that a Commission
might be appointed to take “all procurable evidence
on oath” makes us wonder whether his remarks are
worth a. reply. If in this enlightened age he really
believes that a Commission would do any good it
is not difficult to account for many of his other
statements.
“Upper Murray Man” makes much of the fact
that Batson was able to elude capture for nearly
a week, but to anyone who is acquainted with the
country around Jingellic that is .not at all sur-
prising. His statement that the terrain was more
favorable ■to the attack than to the defence is
amazing. Having been born in the district (at
Bowna) and spent practically the whole of his life
around Jingellic and Walwa, Batson knew the
country better than 99 per cent, of his pursuers,
many of whom had never been to Jingellic previ-
ously. He knew every foot of the mountains, every
hiding-place, and, moreover, from secluded
spots among the thickly-timbered hills he
was able to keep acquainted with the move-
ments of the searchers and dodge them accord-
ingly. “Upper Murray Man’s” assertion that
among local onlookers the police left a strong
impression not only of incompetence, but of complete
indifference to the decencies of their profession, is
an unwarranted and malicious slur on a band of
men who were true to the type which made the
name of Australia feared among the Huns during
the war. Many of the searchers were, in fact,
Diggers. We heard nothing but admiration for the
indomitable spirit they displayed in their strenuous
job. For nearly a week they had practically no
sleep, and meals were snatched at irregular inter-
vals. Some nights parties spent beneath the stars
either watching or sleeping. When Inspector' Parker,
of W’agga, arrived on the Thursday to supervise
operations he had absolutely to compel some of the
searchers to take to their beds for a much-needed
rest. No effort to discount the courage and per-
tinacity of the police and the volunteer searchers
can be supported by the facts, and must fail.
Although it was eventually proved that Batson
was not of the stuff of which bushrangers are made,
until he was actually caught no one knew for certain
that he was unarmed. That he would stop at nothing
to avoid capture had been demonstrated the day
following the tragedy, when he fired point-blank at
two policemen at the home of the Bryants, near
Lankey’s Creek. That being so, the searchers did
their jobs well aware that any tree might be shelter-
ing the crack rifleshot of the Upper Murray wait-
ing an opportunity to add to the list of his victims.
A saturnalia of shirking! Does “Upper Murray
Man” describe willingness to turn out at any hour
of the 24, grab a rifle and dash off into almost
impenetrable country in search of an armed murderer
shirking? It is the kind of shirking which made
the Diggers famous.

Mad Lunatics, Sane Ones, and Others.
One Harnett, described as a well-to-do
farmer, has been awarded £25,000 by an
English jury for nine years’ unjustifiable
confinement in a lunatic asylum, the defen-
dants being a doctor who helped the plain-
tiff in and the owner of the premises who
kept him in. When the Attorney-General,
appearing for the expert who helped plain-
tiff in, admitted that the farmer had been
quite sane during the latter part of his
term, if not for the whole term, there was
little room for further argument except
about the size of the verdict. So the agi-
tation for reform of the lunacy law will be
helped along mightily, though whether it
will get anywhere is quite another thing.
The plain but staggering question at issue
is how to capture the right lunatic, and
how to do the right thing with him when
he is captured. A warm discussion which
recently took place on the subject in the
Australian press revealed two widely-
separated lines of thought and some interme-
diate ones. The official attitude is that any
doctor is a lunacy expert if he says he is.
and that being an expert he never makes
mistakes. x\ll lunatics are, as a consequence,
genuine lunatics —that is to say, all those
in asylums. If a man is not mad when medi-
cally certified, the medical certificates make
him mad immediately. He recovers auto-
matically when the expert doctors discharge
him, and not before nor later. The attitude
of the only other people who seem to take
any interest in the matter appears to be,
broadly, that all the inmates of asylums are
sane except the officials, and the doctors who
put inmates in are all mad. Also the rela-
tives of sane lunatics —those who helped
to get them locked up—-are unani-
mously deranged except when they are
merely wicked, but most times they
are both. Between these two groups there
are a few people who are vaguely and spas-
modically interested; but the great majority
merely say that it is a difficult question,
the evidence being mostly supplied by people
who may be mad, though on the other hand
their opponents may be. Much, therefore, is
talked, and nothing to speak of is done.
Since Charles Reade, who was barrister as
well as novelist, wrote “Hard Cash” —that
was in 1863- —there has apparently been only
one important change. Sixty years ago the
keeper of the asylum wasn’t liable for dam-
ages, wher<#s now he apparently is. The Bri-
tish law still contains the sporting proviso that
if an inmate gives leg-bail to the asylum and
isn’t captured within 14 days the question
of his insanity is automatically re-opened.
Both Harnett and Reade’s hero got away
under this clause; otherwise they would both
be locked up yet. And that suggests a pos-
sible reform. The law can presume quite
a lot of queer things. Suppose it were to
presume that every inmate of every asylum
escaped and remained at large for a fort-
night every year. That would, at any rate,
bring every “prisoner” under review at least
annually.

Exit, a Sham Khali f.
Within a few brief years the Braganzas
have gone, likewise the Romanoffs, the
Tlapsburgs, the Wittelsbachs and a stack
of minor royalities. Now the Othmans have
joined the procession. First the sultanate
was abolished, but a lagging old man of
the family remained on the stage as- Ivhalif,
Commander of the Faithful and hereditary
Pope of Islam. The arrangement lasted a
few months only; now the brief, inglorious
Pope has been deposed, and lias fled over
the border, taking with him Mrs. Ivhalif
(2), family and eunuchs. So presumably
the frayed dignity ends so far as Turkey is
concerned. A trifle over a century ago the
world held three such ancient dignities. The
Holy Roman Emperor passed off the scene
in 180(3, at the ripe age of 1006 years:
Francis of Austria laid down the title be-
cause it would have been undignified to wait
till he was searched and it was taken from
him. The Khalifate has just gone, aged
1292, full of years and dishonor. The
Papacy remains, last of the trinity. The
Turkish sultans were bogus Khalifs at the
best, being neither Arabs, descendants of
the Prophet or of the tribe of the Prophet,
nor, except in a spasmodic way, the keepers
of the Holy and insanitary Places of the
Mohammedan faith. In fact, they were
Khalifs by violence, just as Jack Johnson
might have been if born to larger things
than he was; but their vast power made
people accept them, and by the time the
power had wilted people had got into the
habit of accepting them. Regarded as active
soldiers, the Ottoman sultans really had a
very short run in Europe before fat and the
harem habit got them down. They left off
the habit of travelling, though Abdul-Aziz
paid a visit once to Western Europe, where
liis dulness and ignorance and circumfer-
ence excited comment, not to say derision.
The average Commander of the Faithful hid
in his palace, and lived as long as careful
avoidance of danger would let him. The
assassins only found him. as a rule, after
a long search. Then the eldest male of
the family succeeded, and when the whole
family took to avoiding the battlefield the
eldest male was apt to be more aged than
male. He had spent his early life among
uneducated women in the harem, and his
later years probably shut up and guarded in
a palace, for all the adult males of the Im-
perial House were regarded as dangerous.
So Abdul Hamid, who never saw a motor-
car till he was taken away in one at the
age of 67, was follow-ed by his brother, aged
65, who hadn’t seen a newspaper for 30
years. The end of the remarkable family
was lacking in the picturesque. The last
dignitary of the line was reduced to the
status of a kind of clergyman, for which
position, unlike the Pope or the Archbishop
of Canterbury, he had no training. He was
the nominal head of one of the most numer-
ous sects in the world, yet he was him-
self the subject of an upstart President,
wdio had shifted the national capital, and
left him stranded in a provincial town. Then
the President decided that he wouldn’t toler-
ate even a nominal division of authority, and
the Head of the Church, who had foreseen
the final fall, hadn’t even a spiritual anathe-
ma to fight with. President Kemal may
have badly miscalculated the consequences
of his boisterous line of conduct, and it may
prove that he has dragged down a hornet’s
nest, but if he hasn’t the conclusion will
probably be arrived at that some of the
Great Powers, and especially Britain, have
long been the victims of a delusion, and
have been haunted by an unreal spectre. In
the war-time a tentative proposition was
made that our enemy the Sultan should be
formally deposed from the Khalifate as a
failure and an impostor, and that Britain’s
Mohammedan subjects should be informed
that the honor had been taken over by our
ally, the new King of Hedjaz, an Arabian
gentleman qualified by descent and by his

possession of the Holy though insanitary
Places, and a soldier, as every Khalif ought
to be. It would have been practically a
restoration of the legitimate line: but the
decision arrived at was that Khalifs couldn’t
be thrown about in this casual fashion. Then
Lloyd George was converted, it is said by
Montagu and Milner, to the idea that the
Turk must not be deprived of Constanti-
nople, because it was, like Rome, the seat of
both a religion and an empire, and to insult
it in the two capacities might lead to in-
calculable consequences. The analogy was
a rotten one, for Roman Catholicism grew at
Rome and the population are true believers,
while Mohammedanism was violently im-
ported to Constantinople at a comparatively
recent date, and most of the inhabitants still
reject it with scorn. But Lloyd George
was always an impressionable person, and
his conversion was complete. Now the
Ottoman Empire is no more, and even its
name is extinct, and Kemal has shifted the
Turkish political capital out of Europe alto-
gether, and has chased the spiritual metro-
polis off the premises as if it were a stray
dog, and apparently abolished the headship
of the Church —beheaded the Church, in
fact. If these things can be done without
making a world-stir the Allies might as well
have taken Constantinople when they had
the chance and the going was easy.
How Much Can We Depend on the
U.S.A?
“Gazeeka,” a travelled Australian, dis-
cusses the question:—
Mr. Hughes referred to his trip to the U.S.A. partly
as a mission to weld the opinion of the “two great
Anglo-Saxon” nations into one line of action, and to
put Australia on the map. The stupidity of the
fiist half of the remark is balanced by the impu-
dence of the latter half.
The truth about this American nation is that
it is only in the making, it is not yet homo-
geneous, it lacks traditions and its patriotism is
patchy. A comparable case is that of “great Car-
thage,” a nation of mercenaries. The U.S.A., as
Carthage did, looks formidable only until the crisis
of war challenges the weld of the heterogeneous mob.
What does it know of patriotism or of any of the
other ideals which make nations and which we
people of Australia set. before us ? Patriotism has
been described as the enemy of peace, but it is the
cement of nations.
So far the Anglo-Saxon element in the U.S.A.
(that is, the section of people descended from
British ancestors) has managed to hold the reins of
Federal power; but how long that condition will
last is doubtful. It speaks well for the tenacity of
the British strain of blood that it hangs on and dies
hard in the face of the rising tide of the crossbreeds
produced from the mixed mating of the Dago nations.
Therefore it is well that Australia thinks a little
about this so-called American cousin. In truth,
Ihe Dago cuckoo has introduced a queer bird into
the nest of this people who, we are told, are blood
cousins. Let us state a few population figures, and
clear up the ancestry of this “Anglo-Saxon” nation of
Hughes's mind!
Up to the 1910 census the alien immigrants into
the U.S.A. totalled 28 millions, from 46 nationali-
ties, of whom 7} millions were of British blood.
There were, in 1910, 92 millions of people in
U.S.A., of whom 10 millions were full-blooded
negroes. It is fair to assume that the remainder
of the 82 millions existed in the proportion of their
migration. Of 28 millions 7f millions were
British; hence the British blood in the 82 millions
was about 22} millions, leaving 59} millions of cross-
breeds of all the nations of earth, and 10 other
millions of blacks. The same ratio no doubt exists
to-day, so that this so-called Anglo-Saxon race is
divided roundly into 11 per cent, negroes, 25 per
cent, of British descent, and 64 per cent, of Dago
descent. If the last lot were a pure strain it would
not be so bad, but a mongroid breed produced from
the crossing of 46 nations of different religions and
traditions has no nationality or pride of descent. In
three generations a Dago-American of to-day may
easily have had parents of six different nationalities.
The living representative cannot claim he is any
of them. He has to have created for him an
American nationality, a new religion and new tra-
ditions.
These are ominous facts for the White Australian
to digest. We would, indeed, be insane to believe
that this inchoate mass of descendants of the
builders of the Tower of Babel will ever fight for
our White Australia ideal. It is doubtful if they
will fight for the nationality they are supposed to
belong to. The little job, depend on it, will fall
on the shoulders of the British race if the Common-
wealth is in earnest about its White Australia policy,
and it behoves the country to get the Singapore con-
troversy cleared up so that we know where we are.

Upper Houses and Their Uppish Ways.
The Tasmanian Upper House, when its
shining cranium was lately visible, was obvi-
ously half-inclined to reject the Lyons Min-
istry’s financial proposals, and let the bad
financial situation shift for itself. Aus-
tralia being, in the popular view, a place
apart, where an act of public insolvency
can’t happen even when there is no money,
it would always be possible to take the atti-
tude that somebody would pay if Tasmania
didn’t, and that something would turn up,
even if it was only an earthworm after a
shower. The island Upper House is elected
on a property suffrage, the Council electors
being less than one-third as numerous as
those of the Assembly. There is much to be
said for a system that has only one State
House; but, man being liable to be a rogue,
especially if he becomes addicted to politics,
there is much to be also said for a council
the same size as the Assembly, but created
by the whole State acting as one consti-
tuency. It would have all the advantages
of the Federal Senate without that body’s
great defect—that it isn’t based on the prin-
ciple of one vote one value. At least, such
a State Senate would represent an electorate
which couldn’t be jerrymandered, for its
boundaries would be permanent, and owing
to its size and for other reasons it would be
proof against the worst of the roll-stuffing
and postal-voting swindles. When the two
Houses spoke with voices which weie as
unlike each other as Queensland’s Federa 1 .
voice and its State voice, it wmuld strongly
suggest dishonesty somewhere. Disagree-
ments, which might be frequent, especially
when the Lower House was lower than usual,
could be settled at short notice by the two
bodies sitting together, and voting without
debate. One reason why specimens of some
such august institution should be kept on
hand is that a rush of New States may set
in at any moment. (There is no sign of
this, for which Federal apathy is no doubt
partly responsible, but there is always room
for hope.) And in the case of each New
State acceptance of its legislative machinery
THE COLLECTOR OF SCRAPS.
“In the last year for which comparative figures are available, Australia contributed to the assistance of
British exporters an aggregate sum of £8,750,000. The reciprocal concessions by Britain to the Com-
monwealth were only about. £75,000.”
The Kid : “ ’Strewth, only bones for me!”
should be a condition of entry. This afflicted
land desires no more nominee Chambers,
which tend to seethe with corruption, especi-
ally when they are filled with unpaid poor
relations, and it pines for no more property-
elected Chambers, which tend to seethe with
bigotry, prejudice and baldness. When State
authorities come round with the begging hat
to the Federal door, the need for reform in
such matters might be impressed on them.
In other words, unscrupulous advantage
might be taken of their distresses. If the
existing variety of government has landed
a State into insolvency, anybody who takes
it out has a right to stipulate for a different
variety, so that the annoyance will be less
likely to happen again. Should it be said
that this course of action is an unjustifiable
and gross interference with the State’s inter-
nal affairs —well, of course, it is interfer-
ence. And it might be unjustifiable and
gross if States didn’t and never would loaf
or lean on the Old Man. When it is made
perfectly clear that the Old Man will be
loafed or leaned upon in trouble, then he
can f&irly claim the right to a certain amount
of interference.
“Adelaide” : Details have come along of
the Privy Council’s decision in the case of
WildeN (standing for ail the S.A. farmers
who put wheat into the 191 G-17 pool) v.
Smith (who stands for the S.A. Govern-
ment). Wilden’s claim was that the Gov-
ernment carelessly omitted to protect the
grain stored in various centres, so that mice
and weather played Hades with much of it.
Smith replied: “As a fact, we were not
negligent, but, even if we were, you have no
legal remedy.” The point of law was taken
first, and S.A. Supreme Court said there was
nothing in it. The High Court upset that
decision, and agreed that the Government
could not be liable. Now the Privy Council
says the High Court was wrong, that a Gov-
ernment “may be made liable for negligence
and want of reasonable or proper care, if
proved,” and that the State Court’s order is
to be “restored, with costs here and below.”
The ring is now cleared for the final round,
evidence on the )*lain question whether the
damage—airily spoken of as anything up to
two millions sterling—really occurred, and,
if so, whether Government negligence was
the cause; and the Administrations in at
least two other wheat-growing States will
await the verdict with trepidation.

“Dr. Nil” in reply to “North Terrace” :’ —
(1) I am sorry I said that meat was delivered from
the S.A. abattoirs by the half-carcase, and I take
“N.T.’s” word that it is delivered otherwise, as he
asserts. It makes no difference.
(2) The motor-waggons may be “insulated and
absolutely dust-proof” when closed, but I have seen
them open, and the meat exposed to flies and road-
dust.
(8) The statement as to various costs and expenses
in past and present delivery is interesting, but
“N.T.” ends by admitting that the final cost to the
consumer is “approximately only a farthing a pound
dearer than in pre-abattoir days.” Very well. It is
dearer.
(4) I am also sorry that my statement that “abso-
lutely fresh meat never reaches the consumer”
appears to “N.T.” to be “absurd.” Nevertheless it
is true.
(5) I do not admit that if I “know anything at
all about meat” I “would know that chilling meat
improves its quality and digestibility and chilled
meat will stand infinitely more handling without
becoming infected than meat that is warm.” There
has been an interesting argument lately about the
rapid deterioration of chilled meat when being “de-
chilled,” and talk of someone having invented a
much needed method of preventing the same.
(6) I am interested to know that “at the Adelaide
abattoirs all the employees handling meat must pass
a medical examination when they are engaged,” etc.
But this does not ensure that they cannot infect
meat while handling it.
(7) When “N.T.” adds that “close supervision is
also exercised over all the shops in the metropolitan
area where meat is sold to the public” he is contra-
dicting a statement made by “Another Health
Officer” (B. 24/l/’24), viz., “Nor is it feasible to
have an inspector” to “see that all regulations are
strictly enforced” in private establishments.
(8) Finally, and to recapitulate, I assert that the
advantages (if any) enjoyed by the butcher’s-meat
consumers in the metropolitan (abattoirs) area of
Adelaide derived from the present abattoir slaughter-
ing system are so small, and the disadvantages—such
as delay, extra cost and opportunities for sudden
“strikes”—so great that most of the said consumers
agree with the writer that we would be better off
without the system.

Another Health Officer on stock-murder:—
If “Dr.'. Nil” and “North Terrace” have finished
their side-argument about the merits or otherwise of
the Adelaide abattoirs, I would like to add some
figures from a Victorian country-tow r n abattoir in sup-
port of my original contention that meat supervision
generally is effective, in that it prevents unwholesome
meat from going into consumption. At this place,
during the first five years of the public abattoirs’
existence, the average yearly kill of cattle was 2339,
sheep 18,250, pigs and calves 537. Of these 46
cattle were condemned in toto, 16 sheep and 24
pigs; and there were also condemned 12 quarters,
87 tongues and heads, and 51 pigs’ heads. During
the last five years the average yearly kill has been
1906 cattle, 17,000 sheep, 2000 calves and 700 pigs.
The condemnations average 23 cattle, 50 calves, 17
pigs, 31 pigs’ heads, 44 heads and tongues. In
unsupervised slaughterhouses many of these would
go into human consumption. Most butchers, for the
sake of their trade reputation, will discard of their
own accord all carcases which are obviously diseased,
but cases are by no means rare where the gross
lesions are removed and the apparently sound meat
sold. This is often due to ignorance, not wilful
disregard of health precautions. “Dr. Nil’s” state-
ment that “hydatid disease occurs in an occasional
carcase from private yards” is misleading. The
danger is not from the risk that a cooked hydatid
cyst may be eaten. It is from the dogs which are
usually found at large in the vicinity of private
yards. That hydatid cysts are very common in
sheep’s livers —in this part of Victoria, at least—
I know from personal observation. The dog is the
intermediate host; therein lies the danger. I quite
agree with “Dr. Nil” that ptomaine poisoning may
be caused by contaminated fruit. I never denied the
need for greater supervision of the methods of distri-
bution of fruit, vegetables, milk, etc., and in drawing
attention to that need “Dr. Nil” does a public
service. But I contend that the case for improve-
ment in that direction is strong enough without be-
ing bolstered up by decrying the efficacy of meat
supervision.

Science goes on cheerfully discovering
worse and still worse poison-gases; the dead-
liest compound recorded to date turned up
in Germany the other day and killed no less
than seven chemists who were experiment-
ing with it. That sort of thing seems char-
acteristic of poison-gases: all through the
war the stuff used on both sides was liable
to be as deadly to the one discharging it as
to the enemy. Once a whole force of Ger-
mans was all but obliterated owing to the
wind suddenly changing and blowing back
their poison on their own ranks; and the
French withdrew the stuff they first tried
because, wiiile they merely believed it was
doing the enemy some harm, they knew it
was hurting themselves a whole lot. But
the worse the chemists can do the better it
may be: the knowledge of how horrible the
next war must be to the old m'en in cities
as well as to the young men in camps
should do more to avert it than a hundred
international conferences.

“Tren” : The Victorian middlemen who wax
fat on the labor of the orchardist and the
necessities of the town-dweller are no longer
to have it all their own way. The Red
Cliffs Diggers propose to sell their grapes
direct to the public—guaranteed fruit in
cardboard cartons. Returned soldiers who
own a big Kyabram orchard have already
shown what can be done in this direction.
When stone-fruit was bringing microscopic
prices at the city market, they packed car-
tons, each containing a dozen peaches and
weighing up to 51b., and, taking these in
crates to Melbourne, solicited custom from
the employees of factories, banks, ware-
houses, etc. Immediately the quality of the
goods was seen they sold out everywhere at
Is. 6d. a carton. Of course, the buyers were
satisfied, while growers cleared their crop at
a price far in advance of what they would
have obtained under the hammer. Hitherto
country towns of Victoria that are outside
the fruitgrowing areas have been almost
entirely neglected by the middlemen. Thus
at Seymour, through which station tons of
fruit pass daily, it is generally impossible
to obtain good stuff, though in adjacent dis-
tricts much first-class fruit is left to rot on
account of the poor prices ruling in Mel-
bourne. The increasingly useful Clapp’s
latest brain-wave is to load up fruit-trains
and send them through fruitless places, sell-
ing en route. The plan is an entire success,
and is to be extended.


THE CURVILINEAR MARES GOOD IN

POLITICAL
POINTS.
From this paper’s Gallery-hand:—
Before every Federal session the Melbourne dailies
are assured by sundry party oracles that a “crisis'
will occur soon after the House meets. The season
for wild prophecies having come round again, the pub-
lic is informed that something dire may be expected
from Pratten and Ryrie, who have apparently found a
galloper in Lister, the mournful representative of
Corio. There is a suspicious vagueness about the
plot, if plot there is. Charlton, of course, will launch
a cracker as usual, and there will be a lot of hot
air, a small noise and a smell of gunpowder. There-
upon the House of Reps, will take its coat off and
pretend to get down to work once more.
Governor de Chair fell, as a mattei' of
course, into the clutches of the Millions
Club on his arrival in Sydney, and he told
the Million ers the great but hackneyed
truth that this country wants more popula-
tion. “Effective occupation” has to be
shown when a new claimant comes along,
and if a line is drawn from Burketown
(Q.) to Northampton (W.A.) there is less
settlement on the far side of it than there
was years ago. Australia isn’t making a
bad show in the way of increase of popula-
tion, but it is doing worse and worse in
the way of distribution of population. If
the new people were diffused over the land
it would be possible to make a decent case
for effective occupation. But the Millions
Clubbers, who show hardly any interest in
anything more than 50 miles from Sydney,
are a hopeless congregation for that kind
of gospel.
Painful remarks of Charlton, the Com-
monwealth Labor leader, at Perth :
Mr. Bruce had said that before we could get peace
we must prepare for war. He had heard that gag
ever since he was a boy. His experience was that
every country that prepared for war assuredly got it.
Then Charlton’s experience doesn’t extend
to Switzerland. For the last half-century
the Swiss Republic has been fully prepared
for the sort of war that this Commonwealth
may be called upon to light—a war of
defence. Belgium, on the other hand,
relied on a treaty of neutrality to protect
it. It would have greatly advantaged the
Germans to invade France via Switzerland
in 1914; by so doing they would have
turned the Lorraine line of defence and
threatened the Rhone valley. But. there
was a fine conscript army in the way, and
the operation would have been costly and
doubtful. So the Hun struck at France
through the neutral country that had no
conscript army. And even Charlton may
have heard what happened to that country.
From the lobbies :
For a long time various Commonwealth Ministers
have been buzzing over the continent trying to for-
get the shrill complaints of the Age, but Bruce's
return has compelled them to concentrate in Mel-
bourne again. Austin Chapman, once a vigorous
Protectionist, will find this a bore. Since Bruce
departed, seven months back, Chapman has refused
to revel in a post that a few years ago would have
held him enthralled. His absences have been abnor-
mal, and he has weakly allowed the Tariff Board to
assume an importance that was never contemplated
by Parliament. Possibly some of his casualness and
lack of grip are due to the state of his health, but
he has too much Canberra on his mind to be an
efficient Minister of Customs. Wherefore Australian
manufacturers and other business men can’t be
blamed for wanting another Minister. Chapman’s
predecessor, Massy Greene, was not always a model
of courtesy, but he was generally to be found at home.
Certainly Prime Minister Bruce “brought
back nothing” from England. But when a
man goes to talk business to another man,
and finds the other man dying or dead, he
can’t, as a rule, fetch much back unless he
despoils the corpse.
The waves of suspicion and aspersion in
the matter of the U.S. oil-lease scandals
have washed as far as the steps of the
White House, various code telegrams sent
by President Coolidge have been investigated,
and “the Senate rang with violent attacks” on
him. The last time it rang in real earnest was
in President Johnson’s day ; and, though the
noisiest charge against that earnest ex-
tailor was that he exceeded his powers in
sacking a bad-tempered subordinate, he was
impeached and put on trial, and but for the
fact that the two-thirds majority required to
convict was one short, things might have
happened. Probably Johnson would have
been beheaded with an axe by Hannibal
Chollop or some other character out. of
Dickens. Johnson’s was the closest shave:
no President has ever been actually de-
posed, nor has one ever abdicated.
If Labor-leader Gunn has his way the
number of State politicians in South Aus.
will be reduced from 06 to 35. Gunn’s idea
is to wipe out 11 of the 46 Assembly seats
and abolisli the Leg. Council altogether.

THE INFREQUENT LETTER.
“In the Prime Minister’s home-coming speech at Perth, Empire was mentioned C 6 times, Britain
48 times and Australia 21 times.”
THE AUTHOR: “Well, telling speech. Eh, what?”
THE CRITIC: “Too many E’s and B’s, and not enough A ’s.”
dismissed in the summary fashion which
Theodore adopted with the nominee branch
of the Queensland Legislature, and S.A. Labor
has small chance of getting the necessary
majority in a House for which only 34 p.c.
of the Assembly electors have votes. So
Gunn proposes to copy the Asquitli-Lloyd
George Parliament Act, by virtue of which a
bill passed in three successive sessions of the
Lower House may be presented for the royal
assent, even if the other Chamber has re-
jected it. It is a bold programme, but
optimists willing to bet that the Council will
be destroyed by the legislative route in 1927
would get long odds.
The Speck’s Uppish House has been dis-
tinguishing itself again. It declined to pro-
ceed -with the Appropriation Bill until the
Government sent up its taxation measures.
The strike lasted four or five days, despite
the fact that Propsting and others implored
the Chamber to remember that last session
it had declined to deal with the taxation bills
until the Appropriation bills were submitted,
and that the reversal of attitude was mak-
ing them all look extremely foolish. M'embers
told Propsting, in effect, that they didn’t
give a dash whether they looked as foolish
as they were or were as foolish as they
looked, and the deadlock continued. Then
Premier Lyons did an unheard-of thing. He
invited the mutineers to meet him for a
quiet yarn, and let him explain certain items
in his Estimates which he diplomatically
admitted were not as clearly set forth as
they might have been under different cir-
cumstances. After hearing Lyons’s explana-
tion the Leg. Councillors congratulated them-
selves on their cautious statesmanship and
perspicacious asininity or something, and
agreed to muddle along again.
Sydney Bakers’ Union has called off its
expensive strike against night baking. Prior
to returning to sanity, it had to find £5O to
pay a fine inflicted by the Arbitration Court.
Gone are the days when unions fined for
striking could safely invite the Crown to
whistle for its cash. In 1918 the Act was
amended to provide for the winding-up of
organisations which did not pay fines within
the allotted time. Since then not one indus-
trial body has faced the official liquidator.
They don’t mind being temporarily deprived
of their status —the Court will generally
restore that—but to be wound up is another
pigeon.
Attorney-General Ogilvie’s bill for a com-
prehensive revision of the Criminal Code of
Tasmania passed the Assembly in one night,
the only real fight arising out of the whole
500 clauses occurring in connection with the
question of abolishing death sentences. The
power to continue the hangman’s job was
carried by 12 to 11 in a thinnisli House
on the casting vote of the acting-Cliairman
of Committees, McPhee. The vote was on
strict party lines, with one exception. Oppo-
sition-leader Newton, declaring that he
would rather leave public life than take the
responsibility of casting a vote for the con-
tinuance of the death penalty, Voted with
the Labor Government.
“The richest mica deposits in the world”
are said to lie in the Macdonnell Ranges
(N. Territory), but it takes 25 days per
camel to get the product to the railway at
Oodnadatta (S.A.), and the cost makes work
impossible. So the inevitable Minister
Pearce is considering the installation of a
motor-waggon service. Aaj/thing to avoid
railway-building from the south end, which
would be an intimation that the Government
meant to honor the contract on which the
Territory was handed over. And then those
Queensland and N.S.W. interests which aim
to repudiate the bargain would be very wild
and might bite Pearce.
Abolition of the S.A. tax on amusements
was promised in Premier Barwell’s policy
speech. The impost burdens nobody, and
brings in £50,000 p.a., and a Government
whose interest bill has gone up £735,712 in
three years, as a result of prodigal loan
expenditure, and whose alleged surplus in
1922-23 was a mere £5183 (in 1921-22
there was an admitted deficit of £54,489)
can’t afford to sacrifice £50,000 p.a. But
the Harwell Government is in such desperate
straits that it simply had to offer the elec-
tors something.
It should be known to-day whether the
Lawson-Allan Ministry in Victoria is to go
on or disintegrate. When the Cocky dele-
gates assembled at Bendigo the hopes of the
Agrarian Ministers were rising, and Lawson
was inclined to share in the jubilation. If
cute bridge-building- will do the trick
Allan’s little lot will reach safety, as Alec
Peacock and Lawson (when he isn’t down
in the dumps) are adepts at the game. But
the Victorians are getting nearly as tired
of Lawson as they were of Hughes in 1922.
Unless the continuous Premier makes a
graceful exit he may have a debacle such as
the last Castlemainc Premier, J. B. Patter-
son, had 20 years ago, when he asked the
country to choose between him and Turner.
“Foursome”: “Bildad’s” newly-arrived
bricklayer who couldn’t get work unless he
joined a union, and couldn’t get nominated
for membership till two people had seen him
at work (B. 28/2/’24), is a myth. If he
came from a country or district where there
existed a union, of which he was a financial
member, he should be able to produce a
clearance card. If there was no union of
his trade operating in the place from whence
he came, he can apply for a permit to fol-
low his calling and leave his fellow-work-
men to decide whether he is a competent
workman or a “passenger.” There is no
difficulty at all about getting a start: in
fact, we old hands, looking around at the
number of unskilled artisans, are inclined
to think that it is made far too easy.
A fresh industrial breeze is blowing at
Broken Hill. The new demands include
(1) a minimum wage of £5 10s. and 124
per cent, extra for night shifts, (2) a 35-
hour week on the surface and 30 hours under-
ground, (3) double rates for overtime, and
if overtime exceeds two hours meals to be
provided, the half-hour allowed for the con-
sumption of each meal to be paid for at
overtime rates; (4) Sunday and holiday
work to carry double pay up to seven hours
and quadruple pay afterwards; (5) all
public holidays and a fortnight’s annual leave
on full pay; (6) every employee who is
“ready and available” for work to get a
week's pay, even if there is no work for
him to do. All the raw material for a
healthy row are in these demands, and more
material can always be found if necessary.
Even in its peaceful moments, when it has
any, the Barrier is no gain to N. S. Wales.
But it might be made to pay expenses if run
from Adelaide, which is the nearest city;
and in a lucid interval the N. S. Wales
Legislature might offer its neighbor a degree
of longitude as a birthday present. The
Barrier would be less of a no-man’s land
then, the happy hunting-ground of bush-
rangers.
On a brilliant politician :
Winston Churchill may have been “the one dis-
tinctive figure offering” (B. 6/3/’24) for the West-
minster Abbey pre-selection, but the Conservatives
were justified in rejecting his candidature. Consider
his record as a party man. He was a Conservative
M.P. from 1900 to 1904 (he turned just before
Campbell Bannerman came in), a Liberal from 1904
till 1915, and a Coalitionist till 1922. When the
Coalition crashed he sided with the Lloyd George
Libs, against the Asquithians and lost his seat.
Not 13 months later he stood as a supporter of
Asquith and was beaten again. Six weeks after
that he repudiated Asquith ; another five weeks, and
he was after a Conservative nomination. Having
been very properly turned down he announced that
he would stand as an Independent “in no way hostile
to the Conservative party.” Churchill is commonly
spoken of as a brilliant politician. By the force
of his brilliant eloquence he drove Kitchener and
Fisher into the Gallipoli adventure against their
better judgment. Unmindful of Toulon and Qui-
beron, he brilliantly supported the Russian adven-
tures of Ivoltchak, Deniken, Wrangel and Yudenitch
thereby assisting the Bolshevists (as Pitt had assisted
the Jacobins) to consolidate their power. A brilli-
ant politician, doubtless; and the world is very
weary of brilliant politicians.

Some find their tools in toffs and fops
Hired at a fat and fancy fee;

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
C.S.R. shareholders are being called
together on the 21st of this month to adjust,
capital account so that the obese concern
may comfortably swallow its young.
Towards the end of last month they agreed
to the increase of nominal capital from four
to seven millions, and the next meeting,
which, by the way, falls within a few days
of the annual balancing date, is to be asked
to confirm the increase and finalise the
transfer of the Maoriland and Fiji busi-
ness to the parent co. The subsidiary was
floated in 1915 with the aid of o-j- milk >ns
of bonus pref. shares; but the whole of that
capital together with cash bonuses has been
returned to shareholders since, for reasons
equally as obscure as those put forward to
justify the separation, it was decided to
weld the two businesses. The prodigal re-
turned with its own fatted calf, and when
carving up the beast there has proved to be
so much available for the feast that one
fully-paid bonus share of £2O is to be served
for every two now held. It is a stunning
performance. Precisely how C.S.R. affairs now
stand will not be visible until the current
year's accounts are presented early in May ;
even then it will be impossible to learn
whether any of the newest bonus issue of
£1,625,000 has been obtained by writing up
assets. How great a money-spinner the
C.S.R. has been for shareholders is visible
in this summary of all jugglings:—
Capital subscribed in cash . . . . £2,425,000
Capital returned since 1920 and special
bonuses paid in cash . . . . 4,428,125
Paid capital March, 1924 . . . . 4,875,000
So, besides the regular handsome divs.,
shareholders have had £36 10s. returned for
every £2O of scrip paid for in cash, and the
investment is still represented by approxi-
mately £4O worth of scrip. As for future
divs., this warning issued by the chairman in
November last is repeated for what it is
worth:—
1 should tell you that, if the Board decides to
advise an increase of the share capital so as to bring
this nearer in amount to the cost of the assets used
in carrying on our business, such a change would
not affect, one way or the other, the amount of the
profits to be divided among the proprietors. In other
words, you may expect the rate of the dividend to
be the figure obtained by dividing the profits to be
distributed by the number of the shares to which it
will apply.
The market opinion is expressed in the
purchase of £2O shares at £59, at which
pi’ice the 124 p.c. divs. return less than
4-j p.c.

The prefs.’ 6 p.c. and 12 p.c. on ordinaries
now require almost three-quarters of a mil-
lion per annum, and this big Silent-Worker
reveals only sufficient to make those distri-
butions, contribute fairly liberally to an
employees’ profit-sharing scheme and leave a
tiny bit for visible reserves. Last year
£27,730 was voted to the staff fund, and
appropriations for the previous nine years
were as follows :
1915. . £33,536 | 1918.. £15,771 | 1921.. £27,160
1916.. 38,708 I 1919.. 19,185 | 1922.. 38,445
1917.. 32,285 | 1920.. 24,989 | 1923.. 19,630
During the 10 years covered by the intro-
ductory table £6,097,337 of profit has been
distributed among shareholders, and £277,439
has gone to buy shares for employees—the
latter being one of the reasons why there
has been no clamor by Labor for the nation-
alisation of the business. While these huge
distributions have been made, only a paltry
£21,349 of visible reserves has accumulated.
In ordinary circumstances, with such a
small margin of surplus profit showing, the
investor could not place much reliance on
the persistency of the 12 p.c. divs. But the
British Tobacco accounts are merely like a
severely censored film; the public is not per-
mitted to see how much has been lopped off
before they are exhibited. The published
figures are not intended to reveal the actual
state of health of the huge enterprise; the
accounts are regularly accompanied by the
stereotyped phrases: “The business of the
eo. continues to make satisfactory progress, ’
and “The figures do not include the co.’s
interest in the undivided profits of the sub-
sidiary cos.” The half-dozen or so separate
cos. which make up the combine are tapped
lor only so much of their profits as will pay
divs. and sundries, but that there have been
huge earnings additional to those disclosed
was definitely established by the special pay-
ment of £628,591 to the parent Co. in 1921
which permitted the issue of one fully-paid
ordinary for every eight then issued. Inves-
tors continue to put faith in the storage
capacity of the subsidiaries, and for a long
period buyers have paid for the shares double
their face value, and, in anticipation of fur-
ther pickings, are for the present content
with a return of less than 6 p.c. on their
investment. That the subsidiaries are be-
ing fattened for another feast is only sur-
mise. Excepting the selected few who view
the accounts of all the subsidiary enterprises,
nobody has knowledge of the combine’s true
position, and shareholders are never invited
to share the secrets of their directors.
The published balance-sheet is no more
informative than the statement of earnings.
Paid capital is now £7,207,029, £1,484,727
of it in 6 p.c. cum. prefs. and the balance in
ordinaries. Creditors and “credit balances”
amounted to £76,931 at January 31. Assets
were entered under three heads: Shares in
subsidiary cos. (book value), £5,398,061;
debtors and debit balances, £1,916,468; and
cash, £10,157.

For its third year the Commonwealth Life
collected £16,822 more than in the previous
12 months at an additional cost of £7277;
nevertheless, it was still spending 29;;. lid.
for every £1 of income received. Total
revenue for the three years was £65,085, and
to establish organisations in four States and
win that income no less than £127,330 was
paid away. Shareholders have stood up
gamely to the continual drain on their funds,
for during the past year they contributed
£33.519 in calls and new shares, and also
£6329 of share premiums—a new issue was
placed at a premium of ss. per share, though
prospects of a profitable future were no more
certain than they were at the inception of
the co. This much can be said for the Com-
monwealth Life: it has not been so reckless
as some of its young competitors, nor has it
plunged in costly premises or otherwise
regaled itself in the magnificence which is
the fashion among the new breed of assur-
ance managements. This office is also more
honest in its accounts than some; instead
of smothering deficits in establishment and
similar accounts which are often misleading,
and the nature of which is generally mis-
understood by the public, it charges all costs
against revenue. The debit there at Decem-
ber 31 was £58,880, and, including £5OOO
worth of shares allotted to the promoter at
the inception of the co., £63,880 out of the
£99,527 of paid capital had gone—at least
temporarily—and the balance was carrying
all liabilities under policies. The £36,000
of capital intact was no doubt adequate to
cover fully the reserve which an actuary
would decide was required to provide for the
liability which has thusfar accrued under
policies, and besides those funds there were
also more or less dependable calls for which
shareholders were liable. Probably share-
holders’ funds will continue to be cut into ;
renewal premium income is as yet not large
enough to meet additional establishment
charges—the co. recently opened in Westralia
—and the cost of managing old business and
of writing new policies. Besides, more than
one-third of the premium income is
derived from Industrial business, which is
costly even in large volumes, and frequently
oppressive in small quantities—so much has
been proved by both the L.C.A. and Co-
operative having abandoned that field.
The published accounts do not separate
these two entirely different classes of life
business; hence it is not possible to make
any satisfactory examination of costs. But
that they are pressing heavily is evident
from the entries showing £37,893 of com-
missions and agents’ bonuses against the
year’s net premium income of £38.027. And
while premiums ; barely covered the field
staff's wages, office and general exes, took
£20.173 more. Total outgo was half as large
again as gross revenue. An expense rate
of 150 p.c. does not encourage hopes of the
business soon becoming self-supporting; but
it is early yet to pass judgment. The large
volume of new assurances—policies for
£1,225,305 were written last year—and costs
of extending operations have kept the ex-
pense rate high. The future depends on
whether sufficient of the business written
sticks and on costs of handling the business
being so reduced as to permit the aecumula-
tion of funds sufficient not only to meet
policy obligations but also to extinguish the
deficits. So far the claims outgo has been
light; only £2119 has been paid in three
years, and some of that was in respect of
accident policies under the Workmen's Com-
pensation Act.
So far no policy-valuation has been made;
investigation by an actuary is deferred
until the close of the fifth year.
Even if everything runs smoothly, though,
shareholders cannot expect divs. for many
years, and a very much larger volume of
cheaply-won assurances will be required to
produce profits which will compensate for
their long wait; when surpluses do show
up there will be policy-holders’ bonuses to
consider besides divs. on £lOO,OOO or so of
paid capital. At December 31 £99,527 was
paid up, and there were the following mostly-
tangible assets: Investments, deposits and
cash, £24,735 ; book debts, agents’ balances,
etc., £6973; premiums within days of grace,
£789. Other less tangible assets were:
Office and field equipment, £3145; and sta-
tionery, £1926.

For the December half of 1922 profits re-
covered almost to the pre-war level which
had provided 10 p.c. divs. on £60,000 of paid
capital; but as £25,000-odd more reserves
were helping, the profits, though larger, were
really not so good as they used to be. For
the past half-year there was another heavy
decline, but the directors do not bother to
give any reasons. The last line in the fol-
lowing comparisons conveys the only infor-
mation which can be gleaned from the
accounts and report:—

During the war costs advanced at greater speed
than brewing and pub earnings, so the amounts
available for divs. shrank considerably. The
latest figures suggest that there has been a
serious slackening in the inflow; and 7$ p.c.
was barely earned, notwithstanding that
£50,000-odd of reserves are now claimed. On
total shareholders’ funds the profit-earning
of the past six months, after making the cus-
tomary allowance for depreciation, was at
the rate of less than 4-| p.c. p.a. The actual
state of affairs may be even worse, because
in that statement of funds no portion of
£33,959 lying in a depreciation insurance
reserve has been taken into account.
. All the eo.’s own funds, and a little out-
side money besides, is sunk in the brewery
and hotels. Assuming none of the deprecia-
tion lay-by is a reserve of true profits, those
assets have a net book value of £141,583.

Just prior to the war this dealer in mort-
gages lifted its div. rate to !) p.e., but six
years ago it was dropped to 7i p.e., and for
the past three years tne management lias had
a struggle to earn 64 p.e. The loan business
has not bei* quite so large as it used to be,
but that fading-off did not explain the re-
duced profits. Divs. had to come down solely
because taxes went up, Maoriland having
taxed hard when it went into kliaki. Here
are some revenue account comparisons:—
1913. 191 S. 1922. 1923.
Income . . . . £28,602 £33,702 £32,465 £32,481

Taxes . . . . 849 5,616 4,799 3,142
The shrinkage of divs. was hard on inves-
tors, particularly small ones, in the period
of a soaring cost of living; but in the long
run Maoriland will be better off for the
experience. Provided Governments do not
indulge in reckless borrowing in the future,
the Shivery Isles will benefit from the policy
of meeting as much as possible, of its war
commitments out of revenue. Maoriland man-
agements for several years were envious of
Australian cos. which were not pressed so
severely by taxation; but in the Common-
wealth the day of settling has merely been
postponed, and that means that the agony
of stiff taxes will be more prolonged, the
amount of lOU’s and interest having been
substantially increased by deferring the
settlement of the war-bill.
This Wellington co. did better last year be-
cause the Government reduced taxes (£1657
less was paid than in the previous year),
and because borrowings were cheaper—de-
posits were larger but interest shrank £1216.
But shareholders did not benefit; almost all
the extra profit was taken to reduce the book
value of properties—perhaps to cover losses
on sales, the entry having declined from
£8789 to £l3OO on the year. In the follow-
ing comparisons this asset is included with

The 64 p.e. divs. have been very poor re-
turns considering that in its 50-odd years—
the co. celebrated its jubilee in December,
1922—£74.500 of reserves have accumulated
to assist £125,000 of paid capital. Lately on
total funds shareholders have had only a
trifle more than 4 p.e. The result is more
distressing, too, because the co. has the use
of £338,000 of deposits and instalments on
investing shares. Deducting the final div.
the co. showed £44,570 in cash and gilt-
edged securities. That left £293,719 of lia-
bilities to be protected by mortgages for
£488,849 and premises and property with a
book value of £12,460; —altogether 345. of
assets for every £1 of debt not held liquid.
F. T. Wimble & Co., Ltd., manufacturers
and suppliers of printers’ requirements—the
good Australian ink with which The Bul-
letin is printed is their pit)duct-—have grown
too large for their present capital, so the old
proprietors are offering the public 50,000 8
p.e. £1 prefs. Public accountants E. S.
Wolfenden and Franckel, Spencer and Co.
attest to figures showing 70s. of tangible
assets —there is no goodwill on the books —
to back every 20s. of prof, capital and aver-
age net profits of 13.3 p.e. on average capital
for the past seven years. Net profits earned
by £89,282 of capital for . the year ended June
80 last were four times the amount which
will be required to pay the pref. divs.
Should the co. wind up or decide to repay
the pref. capital, holders are to receive 2s. 6d.
per share premium; it also undertakes to
pay Federal income-tax to the extent of the
rate of tax on the taxable income of the co,
and to reserve at least £2OOO p.a. until the
reserve fund (now £20,102) totals £50,000.
The business was established in Melbourne
in 1867 and the present co. was registered
in 1920. F. T. Wimble claims to have been
the pioneer manufacturer of printing-ink in
Australia, and nowadays the co. manufac-
tures metal-types and numerous other
printers’ requirements. The new capital is
to be employed to extend manufacturing. At
June 30 last the co. was working on an over-
draft of £18,658 and there were sundry credi-
tors for £l6,100; on the other side were
stocks with a book value of £61,207 and
£41,334 of book debts, etc. There was a
mortgage of £26,000 on premises—a new
city building and a suburban factory—which
Richardson and Wrench value at £64,360.

The end of a struggle:—
The last of the concerns trading in marine fibre
in the gulfs about Adelaide has given up the long
struggle; and, coincidently, the English engineer
Wade, who was among the first to interest themselves
in the matter, has been found in a Sydney fiat
dead —in despair he had killed his wife and himself.
The commercial value of the stuff was found out
20 years ago, and about 1910 there was a rush to
get licenses to dredge it in the shallow waters.
Foseidonia australis was supposed to be valuable
for paper-making-, cloth-making, and, at worst, as
a packing for refrigerating plant and such. Marine

Fibre and Yarns, Ltd., was an English co.; Aus-
tralian Marine Fibres, Ltd., was run from Sydney.
Both had to give up. The Anglo-Foreign Fibre Co.
is Dutch, and has stuck to the job till now, but
has at last sent word to Port. Pirie to cut the losses
and wind up. Gerken, the local manager, says that
his company has spent about £250,000 altogether,
and that the financial smash-up of the chief market,
Central Europe, has finished the slump in fibre which
the war began. The stuff is useful all right, and
the supply is unlimited, but it. will not pay till
things are normal again, “and European experts
say that will not be for at least 25 years.”
•Tbhn Brandon’s followers in Melbourne
are being introduced to a few slices of the
Mt. Isa silver-lead field (N.Q.L A. G.
Campbell, formerly g.-m. of B. H. Block 10,
has examined and taken options over four
blocks and also over 200 acres “in a good
position” at the south end of the field. He
has also pegged six other blocks in which
possibilities are at present unknown.
An early Isa float will be the Central Isa,
Ltd., to acquire the Spider, Ant, Barrier and
other leases between the Mt. Isa prospec-
tors’ lease and the Racecourse, both held by
the Mt. Isa Mines, Ltd. The Central is
from the same stable as the Isa Prop., vvith

the same directorate, including Y. J. Sad-
dler and ,T. Milliean. Capital is £lOO,OOO, in

offered for subscription.
The great campaign of pegging wild cats
at Mt. Isa may be given a check by act-
ing-Mities Minister Stopford's decision to
enforce labor conditions on all leases. If lie
does, it will make shepherding unhealthy.

In a recent report on the permo-carboni-
ferous areas of Queensland, geologist J. H.
Reid forecasts the occurrence of an impor-
tant coal series, probably equivalent to the
Greta and Bowen measures, in the country
between Mackay and the Styx River. Coal
has been found north of Mackay, but it is in
bad country; to the south of Mackay the
country is much more settled and consists
mostly of soil-covered plains. Reid considers
that there is every chance that important
seams will be located right on the coast-line.

The big project of connecting Blair Athol
coalfield (Q.) and the coast by a more direct
railway line is under discussion again. The
Queensland Government has been sounded as
to the likelihood of a private line being
approved. It would be between 140 and 150
miles long and would connect with deep
water to the north of St. Laurence. The
scheme has been in the mind of J. F. Hall,
of the Newcastle Coal Co., Blair Athol,
for years, and now that a feasible
crossing of Connors Range lias been found
the co. is making a move. It is con-
sidered that approximately a million will
have to be raised, and negotiations are stated
to have been opened in Britain. Blair Athol
coal is quite suitable for export, but it will
always have a formidable rival in the South
Maitland field. Even with an open-cut sys-
tem of mining, Avbich is proposed, it is doubt-
ful whether the product can be landed at a
port at a price which can give it an advan-
tage over Maitland coal.
Coastal Oil Concessions, at Tewantin
(Q.), is down more than 200 ft. in coarse
sand and clay showing traces of a black,
greasy substance which may be derived from
oil. The bore is cased to a depth of 180 ft.
At 185 ft. a strong flow of water was met,
but that is now under control.
Work has been in progress for some time
on the Mt. Buchanan gold lode, between
Chillagoe and the Palmer (Q.). The lode
is 100 ft. wide, and is said to average
3dwt. at the surface. This cannot pay, of
course, and the co. is gambling on values
improving to Bdwt. or 9dwt. at depth, when
it should have a good chance, Avorking
open-cut.
Recent developments to the south-east of
the old Lucknow field (N.S.W.X, which has
had the attention of several cos. for a couple
of years on the strength of Geologist
Harper’s good opinion, has once more
prompted an inspection by the Mines De-
partment. This time Harper Avas assisted
by petrologist McKern, and a comprehensive
sorting of the rocks was undertaken. The
official report confirms the “Wild Cat’s” re-
cent summary of the South Lucknow’s im-
proved position. After several years of
fruitless searcli for the Contact of diorite
and serpentine, and for the spurs Avhich were
expected on that contact —only in formations
so placed were the large payable ore-bodies
found in the old field —the officials now
state that the level from the new shaft has
definitely revealed a contact position, with
spurs. It was a lucky strike, because if
manager Duncan bad put in his workings
a few feet higher one spur lie is now explor-
ing would probably have been missed alto-
gether. South Lucknow is uoav at work on
a spot which in all respects but one is simi-
lar to makes in the old ground: it now has
to be proved whether the spurs are of size
and carry pay values. The official report
says the spur coming in from the footwall
side at the end of the crosscut ranges from
lift, to -lift, wide; and it is “probably one
of the spurs proved in the No. 1 shaft work-
ings, and should give about 100 ft. of backs
if the ore-body is continuous.” A rise is
now testing it. An average sample across
lift, went almost loz. l-ldwt. gold. The
second spur is 16ft. further on, and so far a
length of 38ft. has been revealed. A winze
chamber is going down on it, and at the
time of the official inspection the east end
was exposed for sft. wide, with 21ft. of
drilling still in ore, and at the west end 7ft.
ore and no Avail showing. An a\’erage sample
from the east face, excluding bunches of
arsenical pyrites, went 6dwt. 13gr.; the
west face, also omitting pyrites, 13dwt. lgr.
At the time of the inspection four tons had
been won from the winze, including 20 bags
of prill. No official details are given of the
hand-picked stuff, but at the mine assays by
the staff arc claimed to have run as high as
360 z. The co. proposes to send a 20-ton
parcel to Kembla within a couple of weeks.
Considerable development work is still
necessary on the present contact position to
learn whether South Lucknow is emerging
from its long struggle as a prospecting show
into a mine with a substantial tonnage of
payable ore. The formations appear to be
going down in good size; and values so far
are at least encouraging. Meanwhile there
is no justification for excitement. The latest
turn-up, however, is heartening for share-
holders, who have seen so much of their
money go in wild-goose chases after the elu-
sive contact and its problematical spurs.

A syndicate, which will be directed by Geo.
Blakemore, J. Negus (g.m. of Mt. Boppy)
and Sam Cohen, has been formed in Sydney
with a capital of £6250 in £25 shares to
test a gossan outcrop at Lue, near Mudgce
(N.S.W.). Gossan, the oxidised remains of
pyritic outcrops, is often in evidence in big
copper shows —including Mt. Morgan and
C.S.A. (Cobar) —and as the Lue outcrop
shows up for nearly a mile, Geo. Blakemore
is keen to learn more about it. The syndi-
cate has had 200 contribs. over-subscribed
and issued 50 fully-paids to leaseholders and
vendors. The first work is to sink a shaft
and ascertain whether an ore-body makes
at depth. Assays by Orr and Welch of
10 samples gave traces of gold and silver,
and eight of them showed copper.

Ive’s Reward (W.A.) has a new plant in
operation, a “vigorous policy” is propose* 1 .,
and the installation of a mill is again talked
of. Nothing is said, however, to dispel the
belief that the shoot is short, and the
quantity of payable ore available for treat-
ment small. The co. is still too weakly
financed to develop the mine thoroughly, and
to determine whether it is nearly as good as
its admirers declare. These are matters
which shareholders, who will be called upon
for funds for the policy the directors pro-
pose, should investigate.
* * * *
Mararoa has lost some of its faith in the
Emu option (W.A.), and is testing a show
at Wiluna. Not long ago the manager de-
scribed the Emu as “quite the best proposi-
tion seen in all my recent inspections,” and
he expected that, while the main-lode had
backs of great extent, a green schist ore-
body in the bottom was expected to be even
better. Other well-known mining men Avho
had made the acquaintance of the Emu had
decided that its feathers were not worth
plucking. The co.’s latest option is de-
scribed by a reliable expert as a fair pros-
pect.
» • • •
Orinda has abandoned its option at Ora
Banda (W.A.). When Adelaide was trying
hard a couple of months ago to arouse in-
terest in this show, and using favorable offi-
cial reports to boost the shares, The
Bulletin mentioned that prospects were
unimportant. and that previous option-
holders had left on account of short shobts.
Still the usual yarns about ore “worth
ounces” in costeens, drives and dumps were
broadcasted, and word passed around that
the market was in for a good time. Then
there was silence followed by a slump, and
later an official announcement that results
did riot warrant a continuance of operations.
Sons of Gwalia announced some time ago
that approximately 7000 tons each of ore
and residues would be treated by the new
plant per month. So far this capacity has
not been maintained, nor has the number of
men employed on the mine been up to
anticipations. As in some mines at Kal-
goorlie, either suitable men or suitable ores
are scarce, with the result that the co. is
picking its men, and treating bnly the
better-quality reserves. Prospects of a re-
vival of divs., which a few months ago were
bright, are now misty.
* * * #
Associated Gold Mines’ interests in the
Keeley (Canada) silver-mines are looking
better than ever. E. T. McCarthy describes
the Birthday Bonanza as probably the most
remarkable occurrence in the history of
Canadian silver. Since his inspection the
show has struck it rich at the bottom level,
and this development is officially calculated
to nearly double ore reserves.
Freney Oil had its half-yearly roll-up in
Perth the other day. Chairman Nicholson
declares that prospects are as good as ever.
He mentioned that Dr. Wade would shortly
have a look at the co.’s holding, but he knew
not Dr. Clapp, and gave shareholders the
impression that a proposal that the U.S.
expert should inspect and report had been
turned down by the Board. Blatchford has
resigned the job of superintendent, and
geologist Talbot is in charge. Blatchford
has agreed to act as consulting-engineer in
Perth. The co.’s cash resources now
amount to about £14,000.
Since the New Year Bendigo mining has
been further depressed by the closing down
of the Constellation, Carshalton, Koch’s
Pioneer, Needle and Monument mines, with
the Bendigo A 1 apparently near its end.
One or two others are in a groggy state, and
the general opinion is that “things were
never worse.” The brighter side of the pic-
ture is that the New Blue and the Hercules
are paying divs., and each appears to have
a lengthy profitable life ahead. Carlisle is
also shaping for third place as a div. payer
-—it is seven years since Bendigo had more
than two mines on the div. list at one time.
Also there are more mines shaft-sinking
than for. some time past. Of the 18 work-
ing mines, nearly one-half are on the Sheeps-
head line, which is now premier, having
displaced from its long reign the Garden
Gully line, which has only four wmrking
mines on its great length. A curious
feature is that English capital, represented
by the Central Goldfields, Ltd., has put in
an appearance. This co., with Govern-
ment assistance, will sink the Central Nell
Gwynne shaft, another lift, and explore for
a new reef, the conditions for whose exist-
ence arc favorable.
* * * *
A plucky Bendigo venture is the New
Hustlers Syndicate, which is sinking a shaft
in Job’s Gully, near Eaglehawk, on the
Hustlers line. The shaft is now down 130 ft.
and the intention is to test centre at about
170 ft. The Collmann's crosscourse is in the
vicinity, This crosscourse had an enriching
effect on the Garden Gully, Paddy’s Gully
and Derby lines, but no attempt has been
made before to test its effect on the Hustlers
line. The small syndicate, though helped
by the Government, will hardly be strong
enough to give the idea a fair trial unless it
has an early success.

Old Mt. Bischoff (Tas.) is in a bad way.
At the recent meeting the acting-chairman
stressed the seriousness of the tin-smelting
competition due to O. T. Lempriere and Co.
having established works. Owing to the
illness of officials, the meeting agreed to
accept the correctness of the financial state-
ments which are to be produced at a later
date. Manager Levings estimates ore re-
serves, or rather adopts the estimate of his
predecessor, at 415.000 tons of 0.35 p.c. tin.
During the period 25,824 tons ore were
crushed for a return of 90 tons tin oxide
(recovery 0.208 p.c. per ton crushed) and
1766 tons of pyritic concentrates were roasted
and re-treated for a return of 71.3 tons
(recovery 0.186). This gives an over-all
recovery of 0.394 p.c.—a very low-grade ore
on which to expect any profit on 1923 tin
prices. Hope for the future, according to the
chairman, is in the workings known as the
“Brown face,” and an elaborate hoist is to
be installed to remove the overburden of
more or less barren pyrites, which, owing
to their peculiar nature, suffer spontaneous
combustion on exposure. Undoubtedly good
ore is available on the floor of this deposit,
but late manager Cyril Gudgeon did not
leave more than he could help, while his
predecessor, Senator Milieu, abandoned it
as of no further value. Possibly by adopt-
ing special methods, a reasonable tonnage of
payable ore could be obtained at present
prices, but the hoisting of overburden and
shovelling it into small trucks does not
look a profitable method. The mine is at
present crushing about 5000 tons ore per
month for a return of 28 tons tin oxide,
with but sljght chance of increasing pro-
duction. Besides, 190 men are now employed
to secure an output no larger than was
formerly obtained with 100 men. It is
evident that only the high price of tin is
keeping Bischoff going. That smelting com-
petition is severe is revealed by that depart-
ment’s report; treatment declined 517 tons,
despite the greatly increased alluvial produc-
tion due to the prolonged wet season. Only
a new, rich discovery can revive old Bischoff
—high tin priced only prolong its death
agony.
Another old Tasmanian show, Bischoff
Extended, plods on its way and refuses to
die decently. At present it is shut down
and, for the third time, is negotiating for
a block of power from its one-time powerful
neighbor, the Bischoff Co. It would be
interesting to know what Extended proposes
to do with thepporeru r er if it obtains it, which
is not likely, unless adversity has altered the
tenor of the Bischoff crowd. Since 1919
only loss has been experienced by Extended,
which, quite apart from metal prices, was
not unexpected, because very little pay ore
has been available. As no new bodies have
been revealed, and the ore reserve is almost
depleted, it is time the Melbourne Board
faced the position squarely and let tributors
loose in the extensive workings preparatory
to a clean-up and realisation of plant.

The landslide at the Jubilee coal-mine, St.
Mary’s (Tas.), gave that promising little
colliery a severe set-back, but about £500
will put it into working order again. The
colliery has also been handicapped by heavy
cartage costs (about 8s. per ton), but within
a few weeks the aerial ropeway from the
tunnel opening to the railway-siding now
being built will be set going. A second
tunnel is being put in to meet the old one
to provide better ventilation and drainage.

“Dal”: The conjunction of “Be Kind to
Animals” Week and the Methodist Confer-
ence in Sydney recalls that when the Rev.
Shirley Baker persuaded the King of Aonga
to start a State church, the loyal Method-
ists and the free Methodists of the native
race showed their disapproval by killing
each other’s animals, since they were not
allowed to kill each other. Now the R.C. s
had a big following, and their animals often
stopped a spear or a bullet intended for
the divided Methodists’ domestic pets. The
late Bishop Olier protested on behalf of his
flock. The other leaders saw the fairness of
his complaint. They advised him to tell his
people to have placards printed and to hang
one on a prominent part of each animal to
declare to. the world the religion of its owner.
In two days every animal abroad in Tonga
ran around bearing a big device “Catholic
pig,” “fowl,” “dog” or “horse,” as the case
might be. The wholesale conversion to the
Catholic faith of the entire animal kingdom
of Tonga made one of the prize stories of
the best beloved cleric that the Pacific ever
knew.
“Crispie”: Is there any sillier jest than
that about Scotch meanness? I spent 14
days’ leave in Bainsford, N. 8., as the guest
of' my Scotch A.I.F. cobber’s parents. My
brimmed felt hat was the password, and
wherever I tried to spend my money I found
nobody would accept it. Even when I was
persuaded to have my photo taken the local
photographer refused payment. The limit
was reached when I dropped my modest con-
tribution into the plate at kirk, only to hear
the meenister declaring that “we must not
take money from one who has travelled so
far to fight for us,” and requesting me to
retrieve my offering. I keep that sixpence
still, wondering if anything stranger ever
happened to a piece of silver.

“Billy Cann”: A cable mentioned that
Priminister Bruce, on his visit to Gal-
lipoli, “rode from Anzac to Chanak
on a Waler left behind by the Light
Horse.” It is news to me that any horses
were left on the Peninsula by the A.I.F.
But I remember a couple of donks which
we were obliged to desert. Whilst we were
attending to the loading of H.Q. horses
about midnight on the last night, one of
these donks strayed along to the barge as
though lie sensed our impending departure,
and had to be driven off. As a final present
for the enemy, some Diggers dressed him up
in thigh-boots and greatcoat, topped with
one of the anti-gas pads of those days, and
bade him a long adieu. If that moke hap-
pened into a Jacko patrol there must have
been ’some fresh demands upon Allah; he
was a weird sight in the half-light.
“Hecagns”: One hot morning at Port
Darwin, in 1920, some thirsty wharfies were
unloading a southern boat and keeping a
close watch the while for anything with a
kick in it. After many slingfuls had coin.,
to hand without a cask or a case of grog, a
crate arrived bearing a . well-known patent-
medicine vendor’s name. This stuff might
be better than nothing; so the crate had an
“accident.” It contained medicine of a kind
—automatic revolvers and cartridges! Each
wharfie took a double issue of the contra-
band, and It is significant that no complaints
were lodged anent the theft. For whom
were those automatics intended?

“Howitzer” : Add this to the collection of war
horrors. A cobber of mine was a moody, taci-
turn chap who before a stunt always showed
extreme nervousness and apprehension.
When the time
came for action ho
seemed to pull
himself • together,
and soon won the
name of a deter-
mined fighter and
a staunch mate.
One day, when we
had been picked
for a raid, I came

were billeted he

searching for some
lost article. Under
pressure he con-
fessed to me that
he’d lost his liypo-

couldn’t possibly
go into the stunt
without it. We
failed to find it,
but finally I got
his promise to
play the game and
go without the
dope. I wish I
hadn’t. An hour
before the stunt
he was found out-
side the barn with
a bullet through
his brain.
Lute cable news of the U.S.A.: —
Certain valuable oil lands were reserved to supply
fuel for the Navy, and the Secretary in charge of
the Department, aided and abetted by other Secre-
taries and bad Characters, leased these lands to pri-
vate people for a song, just as a British Minister
might embezzle the Tower of London or any other-
public asset. About half the community says the
other half is in the business.
The half which wasn’t in the oil swindle was too
busy bootlegging. Apparently there are 1000 illegal

The police can’t find these places. At the same time

“Sixenate”: The other day a boatload
of Coogec surfmen set out in pursuit of an
ass who was swimming to the Cat and
Kittens—the rocks outside Coogec Bay—-
and brought him back to shore in spite of
his protests. They may have saved the
foolhardy person’s life from sharks, but they
also laid themselves open to an action tor
damages for assault. The men who have
undertaken the voluntary work of looking
after the safety of bathers on the beaches
should have their powers made more definite.
It would probably need an Act ot Parlia-
ment to do it. Suburban councils winch in-
clude the beaches in their overlordship are
understood to contend that they have no
authority on the sea side of higli-water
mark: and apparently that is good lawk
“Tarago” : The Modella (Vic.) soldier
settlement had been flooded out for the sixth
time this season, when one of the victims
introduced himself to the chairman of the
Board. ‘‘lt’s no use, Mr. Blank. I’m fed
up ” he said. “I’ll throw th’ block up. A
man cun’t cultivate water. Every crop I
put in floats.” “Y-e-s,” said officialdom,
“but stick to it. We’re willing to help you.
“What's the use?” responded the Digger.
“I’ve alreadv planted crops three times this
season, an’ they’re all gone.” “But,” per-
sisted the man at the desk, “suppose you
gave up trying to cultivate it for a while—
couldn’t you stock it with something? Well
make you advances to give you a start.
The Digger scratched his head and pondered.
Then he brightened. “Would you keep me
going,” he asked, “while I raised a few mer-

In Rabaul a tramline runs from the wharf
through the town, and goods are delivered from
trollies propelled by yelling' natives. At the Ratavul
end of the main street an extension branched off
to the Native Hospital, but had been long unused.
One day an n.c.o. conceived the brilliant idea of
offering the section trolley for sale to a Chinese
boatbuilder on the adjoining area. Hung Fat having
pointed out that the
vehicle was useless to
him without rails to
run it on, that objec-
tion was met by the
native staff co-operat-
ing overnight with
Chinese helpers, and
everything was in posi-
tion by daylight. I
don’t know what the
trolley and rails
changed hands for,
but a small sailing-
boat was part of the
consideration. Some
months later, the
Administrator, prow] -
ing round, sighted the
outfit and ordered a
Court of Inquiry. The
Court must have been
in a complaisant mood
that day, for it accep-
ted without hesitation
(1) the statement of
Ilung Fat that he be-
lieved the n.c.o. was
fully competent to deal
with surplus medical
stores; (2) that of the
n.c.o. that the trolley
and rails had been
given to him for dis-
posal by a former
M. 0., whose private
property he believed
them to be; and (3)
that he (the n.c.0.)
could see nothing in-
congruous in an M.O.
having among his pri-
vate effects certain
tram-rails and a cast-
iron trolley. After
this, it being close up
beer-time, the Court
recommended the for-
tViture of the boat to Administration, and let it
go at that. As I saw the rails, etc., in situ two
years later, I suppose they are still in Chinese hands.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, we’ve said good-bye to Sal and Sue,
And we’ve paid our washing bills:
For we’ve had our fill of Woolloomooloo,
And the same of Surry Hills.
Now, homeward-bound from Sydney rocks,
For our London loves we yearn,
And the old barque sniffs the London docks
As she drops South Head astern.
For the girls have got our tow-rope.
Oh, shake her! Oh, break her!
For the girls have got our tow-rope.
And they’re 'pulling hard, we know,
We can hear their voices calling ;
Oh, bend her! Oh, send her!
Those girls have got our tow-rope,
And we all feel glad to go.
Oh, Sydney girls are bright and gay,
And we hate to leave them so;
But “love and part” is ever the way
Of the men who rovin’ go.
And ere our sails are loosed to the wind,
And the Sydney grog is dead.
We’ve forgotten the girls we left behind,
And are thinking of those ahead.
For the girls are on our tow-rape.
Oh, lift her! Oh, shift her!
For the girls have stretched our tow-rope,
We can hear them laugh and say:
‘‘Fair winds and no lee braces.
Oh, string her! Oh, bring her!”
They’re hauling on .our-towirope,
And the, weight of our twelve-months’ pay.
The Old Man elings to the weather rail
With his eyes on the mizzen royal,
For the roy’l mast bends to the straining sail,
But his heart to his creed is loyal—
The creed that is law on the clipper ships
That sail ’neath the Blackball flag:
“When the wind blows fair carry on till sire rips,
And what she can’t Carry she'll drag.”
For the girls have got the tow-rope —
Oh, brace her ! Oh, race her !
Those girls are on our tow-rope —
We’re as- wet as a half-tide rock;
And our chantyman is singing;

For the girls have stretched our tow-rope.
And they’ll haul till we’re safe in dock.

ARDATH TOBACCO COLTD., LONDON.
“Sclmorrer”: Sydney Jewry, which
already has three synagogues and a Macca-
bean Hall, is to have a Tahara House and
Mortuary Chapel. „ The Chevra Kadisha
(the Holy Brotherhood, which looks after
the burial of the dead) has secured and re-
constructed premises in Queen-street, and
the house of mourning is to be opened during
the next few days. This will obviate the
possibility of the body of a Jew having to
lie in any place where it would be sur-
rounded by crosses and other emblems of the
Christian religion. As a matter of fact, that
terrible thing seldom occurs —if the de-
ceased had no home, relatives usually have
his body conveyed to theirs,; failing rela-
tives, pious Jews will take the body of
a stranger into their own house. Yet in
the ease of one very prominent son of Israel,
a bachelor and a reserved man who made
few personal friends, it actually did happen
that his body lay in the ordinary mortuary
of a Sydney undertaker. That incident, scan-
dalous in the eyes of many Jews, was a
factor in bringing the. Tahara House into
being.

“The Lamb”: I have an exhibit for the
Bully’s tame wowser show. She is a
rather opinionative, acid-dialed, left-on-the-
shelf sample of the sex. She called on the
buxom matron of our women’s hospital, and
over the cup of tea sent this down, the
alleyways of Time: “Really, I think it is
shocking the way they have them in the
daytime!”
“Heilly” on a very gallant airman;—
The most chivalrous adversary we met in Pales-
tine was the German Lieut. Felmy, an expert pilot
and a redoubtable fighter. He led the two air-
attacks upon the desert pipe-line from lvantara, which
supplied the whole army with water, and rarely
missed an opportunity of “mixing it” in the air.
But it was his treatment of captured antagonists
which compelled admiration. In July, 1917, after
shooting down, two of our machines, Felmy sent
per aeroplane to No. 1 Squadron a letter saying
that one officer had
been killed and the
other (Lieut. Vautin)
was well but wanted
some kit. Shortly
afterwards Major Mur-
ray Jones flew across
the lines with Vautin’s
clothing and home
letter?. Jones de-
scended to 50 feet over
the German aerodrome
and dropped the parcel
among the officers
waiting there, return-
ing their hand-waving
as he circled the
ground. Later, the
morning after four of
our airmen had been
brought down in com-
bat, Felmy—who was
recognised by the
machine which he flew
—appeared over one of
our aerodromes and,
after looping the loop,
dropped a message bag
and departed. The bag
contained particulars
about the Australians
who had fallen, some
photographs and a
letter. The last, pre-
served, I believe, in
our National War Mus-
eum, ran: “All dear
sports, my joy was
very tall to receive
your many letters....
You must write more
distinctly, because our
English is not so per-
fectly.... I hope to
fight with this sport
, [Jones] more oftener
... .1 thank also for
the decoration of the
Rising Sun’’ (they had
sent , him an ... A.I.F.
badge). The writer finished up: “With best
wishes for all....with sportly respects, Your U.
Felmy.” In 1918 we remarked the absence of
Felmy from the air, and it was afterwards learned
that prior to Allenby’s big offensive he had been
killed in a flying accident at Damascus.

“Spare Corp”: There are three cheers
coming to the Diggers of Moree (N.S.W.) who
are paying a debt of honor, and paying it
enthusiastically. Their creditor is Mrs. Camp-
bell, an old lady
who made a point
of saying a per-
sonal farewell to
every man who left
Moree to do his
bit, and giving a
personal welcome
to everyone who
returned., besides
helping in all sorts
of war work. She
was so generous
a n d thorough-
going that even the
rings on her lin-
gers were offered
to the cause, she
insisted on raffling
them when funds
were wanted a
couple of years ago
for the local
Memorial Hall. Re-
cently, hearing that
their old friend had
fallen on difficult
times, the Diggers
organised a carni-
val to raise some
funds for her; and
they are pledging
themselves to pro-
vide lier with £1 per week for the rest of her
life.
Le.s Robinson’s Fable 6f the Honest
Worker, the Rent Incubus and the Marriage
Tie
One Monday morning a Marriage Tie, while waiting
to fasten itself around the neck of the first Honest
Worker that should happen to pass, met a Rent
Incubus which was waiting for the same Honest
Worker. Having discussed the temperature, and dis-
covered that they both had business with the Honest
Worker, they began debating as to which of them
the Honest Worker should be saddled with first.
“In the matter of nuisance,” said the Marriage
Tie, “I am undoubtedly the greater, and age my
victims more quickly than you.”
“Yet,” said the Rent Incubus,- “as it is I who
keep noses down to the grindstone and make the
Honest Worker’s life a misery to him, my claim to
take precedence is indisputable.”
“Not so,” replied the Marriage Tie; “but as we
harass, the Honest Worker to a six-of-one-and-half-a-
dozen-of-the-other extent, let us fasten on to him
simultaneously. ’ ’
“By all means, and with all my heart, if I had
one,” replied the Rent Incubus.
At that moment an Honest Worker came staggering
by. Four or five large millstones were already
about his neck, and many incubi sat grinning on his

stooping shoulders; so many, in fact, that, just as
the Rent Incubus and the Marriage Tie were about
to add themselves to his burden, he dropped dead.
“Well, I’m jiggered!” exclaimed the Rent Incubus,
losing its temper. “I’ve been disappointed twice
lately in exactly the same way!”
“As you say, Horace,” replied the Marriage Tie,
scratching its head thoughtfully. “But what steps
would you suggest taking in the matter?”
“I have it!” exclaimed the Rent Incubus. “As
death is the Honest Worker’s only sure way of escap-
ing us, we’ll approach the member for the district
and get him to introduce a bill-that will include
death among the prohibitively taxed luxuries. Honest
workers will then be unable to afford to die, and we
shall have them on toast, as the saving is.”

“777”: 1 suggest that the contributor to
the Little Paper mentioned by “Wingy”
(8.21/2/’24) was indulgingin a flight of fancy
when he claimed that the Germans gave
Georges Guynenier, the French “ace,” a funeral
with full military honors and that 15 French
aviators accepted an invitation thereto.
Fraternising w 7 ith the enemy was not coun-
tenanced by either British or French armies
on the Western Front. The nearest approach
to such an incident as that outlined was the
dropping of wreaths by airmen on the occa-
sion of the burial of one of their number by
the opposing side. In the publication “Guy-
nemer, Knight of the Air,” by Henry Bor-
deaux, the following official document from
the German Foreign Office to the Spanish
Ambassador is quoted :
Captain Guynemer fell in the course of an air
fight on September 11, 1917, south of Poelkapelle.
The bod}'- could neither be buried nor removed, as
the place was under constant and heavy fire. The
shelling had ploughed up the entire district and no
trace could be found on September 12 of either the
body or machine.. The German airmen expressed their
regret at having been unable to render the last
honors to a valiant enemy.
A similar account is given in “Heroes of
Aviation,” by Laurence la Tourette Driggs.
There was no military funeral, and Guy-
nemer received no tribute from his enemies,
not even a wooden cross.
* *. * *
“Wilfrido” : There is a curious divergence
of opinion as to what value should be placed
upon a child’s testimony. One Judge I
know places exceptional confidence in the
evidence tendered by a child, because he
says the youngster can’t so easilv realise
the possible advantages of lying. The other
side, however, never forgets to comment on
the infantile rejoinder to the question “Have
you discussed this case with anyone during
the last few days?” If the answer is nega-
tive, Mr. Wig remarks how obvious it is
that the child is lying; if affirmative, that
the witness has been coached. In either
case lie points out that little or no reliance
can be placed upon the testimony. I remem-
ber the smile on one Judge’s face when the
precocious youngster came out with “Yes,.
I discussed one or two points with my father,
but only to refresh my memory. He told
me to speak the truth, and to tell the Court
all I knew.” Of course, if they are coerced
into lying, they may find themselves in hot
water. Some 40 years ago, in M.L., occurred
a classical example of the wisdom of the
law and of jurymen in particular. The
prisoner was one Elizabeth, aged seven, She
was indicted on a charge that she “con-
spired, combined, confederated and agreed”
with her father falsely to accuse one G.L.
of carnally abusing her. There is a legal
presumption of innocence applying to child-
ren between the ages of seven and fourteen ;;
but as the Judge in this instance did not
point out that it took pretty strong evidence
to rebut such a presumption, the jury
brought in a verdict of guilty. Exactly
what form of punishment could be inflicted
upon a little girl of this age it is difficult
to imagine. At any. rate, her counsel ap-
pealed. and the Court found that, even if
little Lizzie had perpetrated some powerful
falsehoods, the fact did not render her cap-
able of entering into a conspiracy (which
presupposes, first and foremost, a certain
constructive ability), and what the Bench
ought to have done was to have told her to
make a noise like a hoop and roll home.
“Sammas”: A note of mine on the care
exercised by Jewish women in selecting:
wholesome meat lias stirred “Runic.”
“A.J.8.” (B. 14/2/’24) and “J. 8.” (B.
6/3/’24) to a general condemnation of the
Jewish method of slaughter, about which
I said nothing. But if they are looking for
an argument here goes. I say deliberately
that every Jewish killer or “sliochet” is a
certificated specialist with an extensive
knowledge of the organs of animals and an
expert training in the methods of slaughter.
Experiments have proved conclusively that
the animal killed by the Jewish method is
conscious for a maximum period of three
seconds after the knife is used. Lord Lister,,
the great physiologist, has placed it on
record: —
The pain is of very brief duration, as the sentient
brain is at once deprived of the supply of blood
essential to its functions, and the suffering is reduced
to a minimum by the scrupulous care which the 1
Jewish butcher always exercises to have the knife
exquisitely sharp. The Jewish plan is universally
employed for sheep, and the pole-axe [non-Jewish
method] is used for horned cattle as a mere matter
of convenience, not of humanity. To charge the
Jews with cruelty in this matter seems to me grossly
unjust.
This opinion is endorsed by Professor
Michael Foster (Cambridge), Virchow,
Dubois Reymond, Carl Vogt and Gamgee, all
famous physiologists. For 4000 years the
Jews have maintained their slaughter laws,
and it is only within the past couple of genera-
tions that civilised countries arc appreciating
their efficacy. All meat brought into Jew-
ish homes is positively free from taint,
poison, t.b. or foreign matter of any kind.
AGREED.

lack —not a thing fit to go out in.”

for months, my dear.”

Justice Starke’s candor on the High
Court bench (some people, of course, don’t
call it by that name) severely ruffled his
elder brother Duffy in Melbourne the other
day. The question before the Court was
merely the form of an order, and Isaacs
suggested that counsel for defendant would
be limited to facts contained in the
pleadings. Duffy, J., “quite concurred.”.
Starke, however, brushed the suggestion aside
as “ridiculous.” Duffy took exception to
the word, and suggested it should be with-
drawn ; but Starke, with a touch of the style
of his young days at the Bar when he used
to cheek the Vic. State Judges, retorted that
he always meant what he said. It was the
C.J. who interposed to prevent one Wig
asking the other to come outside.
“Topee”: Although the centenary of the
birth of Samuel Plimsoll in February passed
almost unnoticed in Australia (B. 28/2/’24),
an older generation was not as unmindful of
the man and his work. Forty years ago.

when the splendid
clipper named after
the sailors’ bene-
factor was a regu-
lar visitor, a silver
mod.el of her was

The artist was

W. Kerr’s), a Gee-

“The Deacon” on a brace of bishops :
Australia has once again missed the episcopal ’bus.
Despite the late Bishop Gallagher’s oft-reiterated
advice at the close of each synod to be sure and
appoint one of their own, Goulburn (N.S.W.) has
plumped for John Barry, of Melbourne; and Port
Augusta (S.A.) has decided in favor of A. Killian,
the Vicar-General of Wilcannia-Forbes and Dean
of Broken Hill, in succession to the Australian-born
John Norton, who died just a 3 T ear ago. Bishop
Barry is only in the mid forties and is a “townie”
of Archbish. Mannix, hailing from Cloyne, and also
graduating from luaynooth. The hand in the
appointment is probably Mannix's, though the voice
is the voice of Goulburn. Barry has been
his Grace's private sec. and administrator of
Melbourne Cathedral. Killian is a 8.A., and has had
30 years of the sin, sweat and sorrow of the Out-
back. He ran the huge diocese of Wilcannia on the
death of Bishop Dunne until the appointment of Dr.
Hayden about six years ago, when he was appointed
V.-G. A brother salvages the souls of the Outback
in the same diocese.
Frederic Chappie, dead in Adelaide at
78, wa§ headmaster of Prince Alfred College
for close on 40 years out of its first 50.
He succeeded Hartley, and Bayley succeeded
him. He was also prominent in the ’Varsity
of Adelaide, being on its Council for over
20 years and Warden of the Senate for
nearly 40. Also four sons and two daughters
took degrees at it —which is a local record.
One daughter is among Adelaide’s leading
woman doctors. Haslam, a son-in-law, is
head of King’s College, the just-founded
Congregational-and-Baptist boys’ school in
Adelaide.
When Francis Jeremy North passed out
in Rockhampton recently at 05, Bananaland
lost one of its best-known surveyors. Dub-
lin born, he came to Australia as a boy, was
employed by the
Q. Government for
30 years on rail-
way-survey work,
then, after a break
of two years in
New Guinea, took
up surveying for
the Q. Main Roads

for 19 years, and
Springton, near
Dnaring a—and
these were managed
by his wife and
sons. She was a
daughter of Lands-
borough, the ex-
plorer. North him-
self was a direct
descendant of that
Lord North who
lost Britain her
American colonies.

“G. Ron” (London) : Bruce’s alleged
Oxford accent, which so disturbed the pro-
letariat in Australia, was conspicuously un-
noticeable in England. By comparison with
the vowel-moutliing of many Londoners,
his voice was “quite colonial, what!”
Nevertheless, the distinction which came to
him from his spats was in no way dimmed
at the Imperial Conference. In the first
photograph of the delegates Bruce was the
only one sporting ankle cuffs.
John Howarth, who has just died at Lis-
more (N.S.W.), was the nominal plaintiff
in the action taken by the soldiers returned
from the Boer War against the N.S.W.
Government to recover deferred pay. The
matter went as far as the Privy Council;
but ultimately a Royal Commission appointed
by the Carruthers Ministry decided that
£30,000 should be cut up among the men.
Howarth was an old warrior at the time he
went to the S’African disturbance —-he was
75 when he died—and the fighting spirit was
inherited by his sons. Four went to the
Big War, and only three returned.
The last of the old-time priests of Sydney
R.C. Archdiocese passed to the New Jerusa-
lem lately when John Doyle, chaplain of St.
Margaret’s Hospital, went out. Arriving in
Australia nearly half- a century ago, he did
much clerical pioneering work, but of late
years had dropped right out of the ecclesi-
astical hunt. A Doyle of County Carlow.
Ireland, he was, of course, a cousin of
Cardinal Moran, and was associated with
that prelate 40 years ago. Another clerical
cousin still survives in Australia —Paul
Cullen, nephew of the Irish Cardinal and
himself the superior-general of the Vincen-
tian Missionary Order in Australia, with
headquarters at Ashfield (N.S.W.).
Charles Hayes, who died at Manly (Syd-
ney) last week, aged 83, was the seaside
village’s Oldest Inhabitant. He travelled on
the old Phantom, witnessed the maiden voy-
age of the Fairlight (the former vessel is
long since extinct, while the Fairlight is
unrecognisable as a cargo carrier), saw the
Cardinal’s Palace built, and helped to plant
the pines on the ocean front. He was secre-
tary of the Royal Exchange and the Cham-
ber of Commerce for many years, and one
of the first aldermen Manly had. The first
meeting of the Manly Council was held in.
his dining-room.
As a public trustee Vic. ex-Treas. McPliair-
son was vera close in sma’ things ; but he lias
shown that he can be generous in big things
bv giving £25,000 to build a new Melbourne
college of domestic economy. He handed
Premier Lawson Commonwealth stock tor
the full amount, and asked that the school
should be named after his guid wife, Emily.
Appin, a N.S.W. highlands village, has had
its hour of excitement: a man arrested at
the Cordeaux waterworks shot the constable
who was taking him into town, and then
turned the “gun” on young Guy Chalmers
Clift, who had been pressed into the service
of chauffeur. Both men are dead. Clift —
one of the old-established Breeza grazing
family-had a notable career through the
engineering school of Sydney Uni., and a
while ago was put in charge of the Cordeaux
works. He behaved through the whole shoot-
ing business with great courage and calmness.
“Ashmead”: With a pride more pathetic
than he knew, Henry Littler, accountant for
the Mount Bischoff Co. (Tas.), used to de-
clare that he had never taken a holiday from
his work. He joined when the co. was started
52 years ago. Ritchie, the manager, has had
considerable illness in the last two years, and
the accountant, therefore, had extra work
to do, particularly in preparing the financial
statements for the half-yearly meeting, which
took place the evening before his death. The
load was too heavy for him, and lie prac-
tically fell at his post; that was why the
balance-sheet was not presented at the meet-
ing.
The new president of S.A. Agricultural
Society is Walter Duncan, grand-nephew
of W. W. Hughes, one of the original owners
of Wallaroo-Moonta cOpper-mines, and foun-
der, with Thomas Elder, of Adelaide ’Var-
sity. Duncan, himself an M.L.C., has an
elder brother in the House of Reps.
Symon, K.C., is the chief feature in an-
other amalgamation of Adelaide law firms.
Symon, Browne and Symon loses its middle
name, Browne leaving to join Bennett
(R.W.) and Campbell (Gordon). The Iv.C.
and his son take in another whole firm,
young lawyers with a large connection
among S. Aus. landowners, and the name
becomes Symon, Mayo, Murray and Cud-
more.
“P. Pawnticket”: With an idea of making
his fortune solid, jockey W. PI. McLachlan
converted his -savings into bricks as he went
along. Perouse-road, Randwick, holds a
chain of his property, and the cottages have
the names of horses on which he made his
big wins. There are others. When Alex-
ander originated the first big Druids' Gala,
out of which he himself made a fat cheque,
he built a cottage in Macpherson-street,
Waverley, and called it Druidsville. A Syd-
ney professional gambler went one better
recently. From a squatter, who challenged
the Fates by trying issues with a man against
whom wellwishers warned him, he won over
£2OOO in a night. The money went to the
purchase of a residence which now bears the
name of his victim.
“The Deacon” : Although Australians don’t
seem to have any luck in the running when
a bishop is wanted for even its out-back
dioceses, Australians are invariably con-
sidered good enough to train the young
clergy. The latest appointment to the pro-
fessorial staff is Eris O’Brien, who takes
up work at St. Columba’s seminary at
Springwood (N.S.W.), where the president
is another Australian —Eugene Brauer.
O’Brien, who has already several books to
his credit, including the “Life and Letters
of Father Therry,” will now probably tackle
the “Life of Cardinal Moran,” which has
been delayed by the death of Tighe Ryan,
editor of the Catholic Press, and the ill-
ness of Monsignor O’Haran. Ryan was to
have supplied the literary style, while
O’Haran, whom the old man once described
as “a unit of myself,” was to supply the
pabulum.
As was foi'eseen, Marcus Saltau, retired
merchant and chairman of the Charities
Board, won the Western Province seat in
the Vic. Dreary House from squatters Beggs
and McArthur. He will represent tin* spirit
of Warrnambool more ti-uly than does the
unjoyous Deany in the Assembly.
“Nitric”: Many old seafarers will pull a
forelock at the passing of that thoughtful
woman. Mrs. Willis, of Russel Island. Her
hospitality has been shared by many, but the
clear beacon-light she placed on the island,
at her own dost, and tended for years with
her own hands, will be remembered with
gratitude by scores of men of the sea who
never met her in person. Mrs. Willis came
to Queensland in ’6(5, and she died at
Canaipa, on the island, in her 74th year.
“Andesite” introduces three chemists: —
All three scholarships just awarded by the Q.
Government for research in sugar chemistry were
ta.ven by local ’Varsity men. Norman Bennett, a
B.Sc. and B. of App. Chemistry, who got the
scholarship for sugar technology, comes from a brainy
family. His dad is a B.Sc., and head of the Too-
wong State School. A younger brother headed the
list of ’Varsity exhibitioners a few years ago, and
has now qualified for the double degree, like his
brother, and a sister is on her way to a degree.
For several years Bennett has held a chemist’s job
at the South Johnstone sugar -mill. The other two
scholarships went to H. W. Kerr and A. F. Bell, the
latter an ex-A.I.F. man. Both are reading for final
honors in chemistry this month, and whatever spare

N.S. Wales, formerly honorary Com-
mon wealth Commissioner in the U.S.A.

Economics supplies The Bulletin with

time they have they give to the Q. Government Agri-
cultural Chemist as his assistants. Their work will
deal' with soil and plant problems. All three scholar-
ships are tenable for four years, most of 'which will
be spent abroad, in all probability in Glasgow,
U.S.A. and Hawaii.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Ramsay Macdonald’s
tall liat. I have a copy of an old-fashioned
photograph of tin' president and committee
of the third Melbourne Eight Hour Day,
1858. There are 30 figures in the picture.
President R. Miller, sec. G. Ravenscroft
and nine others wear chimney-pots.
“Mag”: Ninety-nine not out, Mrs. B.
Postle, grandmother of Arthur, one-time
champion sprinter. She arrived in Mel-
bourne in 1851, and she celebrated her
arrival at the threshold of the century at
Toowoomba (Q.) the other day by assist-
ing to entertain 100 relatives and friends.
The following day she was young enough to
attend the wedding of a great-grandchild.
The old lady lias 44 grandchildren, 65 great-
grandchildren and a young army of g.-g.-g.’s.
The Australian record established by
Sarah Barlow, of Penrith (N.S.W.), should
stand for some time. Nearly 97 years ago
she was born in the old town, and had lived
there ever since. Her husband was a
pioneer of the Nepean district, and one of
their daughters married into the historic
Parson Fulton’s family. Another record of
the old lady that is also likely to stand is
her unbroken occupancy of the one pew in
the old Anglican church of St. Stephen’s.
She was baptised and married in that vener-
able edifice, and she attended there every
Sunday, wet or fine, till within a fortnight
of the end.
H. M. Murphy, sec. of the Vic. Labor
Department, will retire soon, and make way
for his coadjutor, Stevens. Before succeeding
Harrison Ord as Chief Inspector of Factories
14 years ago Murphy was a police magis-
trate. Tie organised the department so well
that it has almost run itself in recent years.
What with increased factory fees and regis-
tration of shops lie got in nearly as much as
it cost to manage the department —and out-
goings include fees for no less than 170
wages boards. One time it looked as if he
would be made Police Chief, and lie would
have done better than Steward, Gellibrand
or Nicholson in the job.
Death has been busy of late among the
heads of the Sisters of Charity in N. S.
Wales. Last year Mother Frances
McGuigan. ’the Superior-General of the
Order, had established a record of 36 years
as mother superior, and at her death Mother
Mary Berchmans Daly was appointed. Now
she has established the second record by
dying after four months in the job. Born
in Ireland nearly 60 years ago, she reached
Australia when five, and after a distinguished
career as a public-school teacher at Fort-
street and Grafton (N.S.W.), joined the
Sisters of Charity. What she will be best
remembered by is the establishment of clini-
cal hospitals in Sydney, Melbourne and Too-
woomba (Q.), as well as hospitals in Lis-
more and Bathurst (N.S.W.).
SONG OF THE SURF MEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, strive you that have wed strife,
Question and seek and fuss.
But life, life, red life,
That is enough for us.
The blue waves beckon and call us out,
And bold are the songs we hear;
The songs that rollick and roll and shout,
Where the breakers fall and the seas run out,
And the vagrant bubbles steer.
Our arms are strong as the stuff of steel,
And brown as the rust of guns ;
Our legs are true as a cutter’s keel;
Our eyes are quick as the gulls that wheel
Where the wandering tide runs.
Our creed is made of the salted air;
Our god is a kindly god;
A god that laughs when the day is fair,
And judges men by the things they dare,
And not by the ways they plod.
Oh, cling you to your old ways,
Clamor and sweat and fuss;
But days, days, gold days,
They are enough for us.

THE TERRIBLE TACTICIAN.
“Gam, yer Icttin' him drag yer ’ome.”
“Ain't! I'm just kiddin’ ’im into a quiet place to knock
him.”
“Wee Bobbie's” slice of Island life:—
A few years ago in the New Hebrides I saw a tragic
domestic flare-up—the eternal triangle, of course.
Buku had bought the woman for four pigs and a
quantity of trade; Anis wanted the woman and
the woman wanted him, hut poor Anis hadn’t the
purchase price at the time. The constant meetings
of the lovers aroused the just ire of Buku, and there
was a challenge to a duel with bows and arrows.
They took up their positions about 70vds. apart in
a eocoanut grove; but neither of them seemed
anxious to get hurt, and the supply of arrows ran
out before any damage was done. When Buku’s
Mary saw the supply of arrows finished, she ran in
and tried to pull one from a eocoanut-tree to give
to Anis. She was behind the tree reaching round
for the embedded missile when Buku let go a stray
arrow he had found, and Mary’s hand was
pinned to the tree. She first pulled the whole
length of the arrow through the wound, then tore
the weapon out of the tree and rushed at Buku
screaming. As she neared him she jabbed at him
with the arrow; but Buku grabbed it, jerked it from
her hand and stabbed himself with it in the temple
and fell like a log. Straightway the woman plumped
down by him and wailed. She tried to lift liim
in her arms; she called him by name and stroked
the lashes over the dead eyes, and she hugged his
dead body. When the villagers came to prepare
him £or burial, they had literally to drag her away.
A few minutes later the village rs disappeared down
the bush track with the gruesome burden, and
Buku's Mary proceeded to Anis’s house and quietly
prepared the evening meal.
“Northerner”: “Stellsby” (B. 14/2/’24)
lias evidently read an inaccurate account of the
death of the man who was taken by a 13ft. cro-
codile. After the poor fellow had been seized the
croc, swam round the hole looking for a suitable
spot wherein to bury his victim, whom he carried
in his jaw’s. Early next morning the croc, was shot,
and the body of the man was found under about
2ft. of mud and leaves. So “Stellsby” may take
heart of grace again and rejoice that he and the
far-famed Abo. Council have not been the victims
of a mistake with regard to the brutes’ habit of
always burying their food.
“J.P.” : Old Bagful hung his sorry-looking
moke to the rail outside the pub the other day and
went iii for a refresher. He had hardly blown the
froth off when two excited youngsters charged in.
“Hey, mister,” they yelled in chorus, “your horse
has fell dow’n!” Bagful glared at them over the
top of the glass for an instant; then he rasped out,
“If he has, then you young cows must have pushed
’im down!”
“A. J.S.”: Re Jack Howe’s much-discussed
hand-shearing record of 321 in a day. While I don't
doubt that Howe got over and was paid for that
number, I do know he would be pretty fast if he
could shear half that number properly. I followed
shearing for years in Vic., Tas., N.S.W. and Maori-
land, knew most of the old-time ringers, and sheared
with some of them. My experience and observation
went to show that when really good work had to be
done the abnormally fast man w f as hardly as good as
the average man. At Brookong (N.S.W.), where 1
was on the board in 1880, 97 men put through
335,000 sheep. Ringers with wonderful speed repu-
tations were there from all the colonies and MX.—
and 135 ewes and lambs was the highest tally. First-
class work had to be done, with the, result that the
fast mullockers were thrown out of their stride and
never got near the front. In 1884 three mates and
myself, after doing 175, 163, 156 and 154 in one day
at Hawkview (N.S.W.), went over to a shed at
Campbelltown (Tas.) under a man w’ho insisted upon
having really good work done- —and our best tallies,
were 101, 101, 101, 86. The 86 w 7 as put up by the
man who had done 154 at Hawkview. I could furnish
many further illustrations to prove my contention
that no man with the hand-shears could shear even
200 properly, let alone 321. '
“Jacky Roobunny”: Said Horrigau, the
rabbiter: “Yairs, the highest price ever 1 got fer
rabbitskins wars in the 1922 drought out Adamin iby
way. The rabbits there was so poor an’ hungry that
they chewed the bark orf the w’attle-trees. A month
after they started their wattle-bark diet, I topped the
skin market down in Sydney. Yairs, an’ I reckon
yous blokes ’ll call me a liar, but the skins was
tanned ready fer makin’ up afore I yanked ’em orf
the bunnies!”

“Brud”: A black-colored fish that aver-
ages about 51b., looks somewhat
like a black bream, and is
found only around the Norfolk
Island coast, will give 95 per
cent, of those who eat its flesh
after sundown an extra-special
line in nightmares. “Home
Nanvvy” jsi the name given it by
the Norfolkers, and, being rather
a wily specimen to catch with a
line, it is looked upon as a deli-
cacy. Its ; decidedly peculiar
smell and a similar taste when
cooked, keeps the tourist off it,
and when told of the extraordi-
nary dream-properties it possesses
the visitor is usually much
amused. However, I have seen
several try it, and in each case
the dreams came duly to hand-
in one case the experimenter
woke up through walking into
a disused sawpit half a mile from
the boarding-house, clad only in
his pyjamas. Islanders tell some
queer stories of the doings of
people while under the influence
of this drug, or whatever it is
that the fish has on tap, and they
go so far as to say it is impos-
sible to awaken people while they are affected by it.

“Bouragi” : “Tamoruie’s” burrowing jungle-
fowl (B. 2X/2/’24) - are not so rare as he seems to
think. They, or varieties of the species, are found
in some parts of the Malay Archipelago, and I have
heard of them in Malaita, in the Solomons. An old
friend, the late Douglas Rannie, who was many years
a Government agent in the Queensland Kanaka trade,
describes “Tamornie’s” poultry in his book on the
trade. He says, further, that in his time the New
Britain nigs used to beat up the eggs with grated
eocoanut and pour the mixture into big cones of banana
leaf. These were then put into the hot springs men-
tioned by “Tajnornie,” and the resulting custard was
bartered to the trading schooners or the bush tribes.
“Oxmead”: A Sydney daily publishes a
wild-looking yarn about herds of wild camels, pre-
sumably the progeny of beasts that have escaped or
wandered away from servitude, having been seen m
the desert south of the East-West railway. It is not
mentioned who saw them : possibly travellers between
Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie surveying the dreary
Null arbor Plain through binoculars. Certainly a
camel anywhere between the line and the horizon,
or even a decent-sized dog, would be hard to over-
look. Doubtless camels have strayed away from their

owners, or been left ownerless through the death of
prospectors; but whether a beast that has been more
or less domesticated from th,e first dawn of history
would take kindly to the freedom of the Australian
bush is a trifle doubtful, and in any case the blacks
have to be reckoned with. Most lost camels, strag-
gling back in their own tracks, have provided natives
with a little sport and a lot of dinner.

“J.H.S.”: I can’t understand anyone be-
coming immune to bee-stings (“Wax,” B. 7/2/'’24).
Some years back, when they were being boosted as
a cure for rheumatism, I wriggled to as many as
50 stings at a sitting, and I must have dragged the
darts out of 1000 bees at least. But I’m just as,
sensitive to a sting to-day as ever I was, and that’s
a lot. There is a certain amount of immunity after
the first dose or two of torture; but only on the
harpooned area, which, after 20 or 30; buzzers have
done their worst, puffs up,-the skin becoming thick
and callous. But as soon as the thickening subsides
the peel recovers its sensitiveness, and, a sting on the
healed area makes you swear and hop round just as
lively as ever. By the way, I noticed that bee-sting
poison has a marked effect on the sight. My eyes
became weak and sore for the first few days ; but the
vision improved wonderfully afterwards.
* * * *
“Dingaan” : Allow me to correct “Dr. Nil”
(B. 21/2/’24), whose explanation of the derivation
of “crawfish,” though ingenious, is wrong. The
word is a peculiar corruption, comparatively recent;
formerly “previse” or “ereveys,” it; comes from the
Old French crevice, Old High German krebiz and
German krebs, all of which mean “crab.”
“Jimmy Possum”: I agree with “Golub”
(B. 21/2/’24) that a 4ft. spring is rather above the
average achievement of the ordinary snake: but if
would be quite possible for one to strike that distance
in certain circumstances. Pinned a couple of feet
from the end of the tail, a 6ft. Gin. slitherer would
be able to strike fully 4ft. in any direction, and in
that case a horse with his head at ordinary walking
height might easily be bitten on the lip, particularly
if the reptile was trodden on from behind. 1 have
known a medium-sized, snake back-somersault at
least 3ft. in the air when sneaked on to and stria k
with a light , stick well astern —one nearly got my
hand as it leapt back. Several times I have pinn d
wrigglers, to the ground with a. stick, and they hav e
always swung round wildly, with the forward
free portion clear of the ground.
“Amberite” : "Liudesay” (B. 01/l/’24)
erred when stating that Alf Parsons’s total of 20')
posts stood as a record for a day’s fencing. On
Yancannia station (N.S.W.) Fred Graves put up 230
posts, 20-in. holes, working from 7 a.m. till 4 p.m.
Another day’s work that stands to Fred’s credit is
170 posts, cut, carted and laid on the line. Almost
anyone west of the Darling can verify this.

“AdeL”: “The Overlander’s” droving
family (B. 20/12/’23) reminds me of a. unique one I
met on the same overlanding track south of Birdsville
(Q.) some years ago. Dad, two sons and two
daughters were piloting 20,000 sheep from Central
Queensland to Quorn (S.A.), and on being directed
to their night camp, where two other daughters had
the horses in hobble, I was greeted by an old silver-
headed lady and a fifth daughter, the chief of the
pots and pans. When the woollies were securely
inside rope-breaks and the members of the family
outside the evening meal, dad took a tin whistle, the
two sons concertina and castanets, the five girls an
assortment of violins, mandolins and banjos; and,
to the accompaniment of the band, the old lady sang,
pouring forth melodies the like of which the surround-
ing sandhills could never have heard before. I was
told this was a regular feature of their evenings on
the road with stock.
“Glibe” : “Spenner’s” reference to Binghi's
material for canoes along the Murray (B. 21/2/’2l)
is wrong. The abo. always took his bark from the
main trunk of the tree, and not from elbows, Also
the operation was always carried out from the ground,
and not at heights of 30ft. or 40ft., as “Spenner'’
says. Conclusive! evidence is very plentiful around
Mildura.
* * * *
“Wink” : “F.A.’s” par. on equestrian acro-
batics (B. 21/2/’24) reminds me of my one feat o!
horsemanship. In 1916 I, with other Oameliars, was
temporarily hung up at the Light Horse base at
Moascar, and it was our duty to take to water through
an enormous Tommy camp a few reject nags, all
dopes and outlaws. Being but a mild horseman then,
I was always given something special, and on this
great day my mount was a vicious and badly girth-
galled mare. As, stiff before the gazing infantry, we
were riding through the tents of the Tommies, my
mount suddenly shied and then got straight up on
her hind legs. Knowing no better, my pull on the
reins increased, and consequently the mare, after
YES, RUT THERE ARE OTHERS.
MRS. WOOPWOOP: "I'm sure it’s not a lit
nice. Now, what would yon say if I
was to strip off all my clo’es and start
running about with nothing on? Would
you think I was very beautiful?”
MR. W. W. ( dreamily ): “P’raps not. But
— say—that noo girl up at Swanson's
pub would look bonz!”
standing on tiptoes, went right over on her back.
I found myself sitting on her belly, my feet out of the
stirrups but firm on the ground. With a grunt she
rolled over and struggled up, with me, trembling,
still on top. My cobbers made fun of my < rude
exhibition ; but the next few days are dim with beei
bought by my English admirers.

WHEN DAD PUTS ON HIS “BLACKS.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Dad goes out to push the plough,
Just clad in shirt and moles,
With boots that have the uppers lashed
With greenhide to the soles,
He looks a nat'ral sort o’ bloke
Who reaps and sows and stacks ;
llut Lord! it gives us all the creeps
When Dad puts on his blacks.
When Dad is in his working clothes
His mates all call him Bill —■
The same as any other bloke
Who doesn’t put on frill.
But if on Sunday morning to
The church he’s making tracks,
They always call him Mister Brown,
For Dad’s got on his blacks.
I mind when Granny Brown fell ill,
Dad hung them on the line
To dry the ink he'd painted on
The seams that used to shine.
And though the Doc. spoke hopefully—
Like all our country quacks—
We knew that Gran was going west
When Dad dug out his blacks.
Sometimes the parson visits us ;
We always know the sign—
An awful stink of camphor-balls
From clobber on the line.
And, no matter though we’re busy
Threshing wheat, or sewing sacks,
We must hold a stop-work meeting
When old Dad puts on his blacks.
One time when Jim was at the war,
And Mum grew pale and slim
Because for weeks she’d looked in vain
For any word from him,
The light burned in the old slab hut
Till dawn peeped through the cracks,
Where Mum had cried herself to sleep,
While Dad benzined his blacks.
I don’t know why or where he got
Those hand-me-downs of woe
Some blighted undertaker’s man
Oast foith long years ago;
But births, or deaths, or marriages,
Or something else that smacks
Of grief and woe, is always nigh
When Dad puts on his blacks.

“Ko-I-Noor”: If “Centre” (B. 14/2/’24)
wants to win the Centipede Stakes he had better
enter full-grown ones, not mere infants of eight
inches. Why, those found ;on the N.S.W. Southern
Tablelands will tape up to nine inches; and on the
H.S.W. South Coast I have found them nearer ten
than nine inches, and that without looking for them.
Bill Carson (Bordertown, S.A.) is still
on deck:—
“Back Block” (B. 20/12/’2S), going back to the
old days, nominates me as the greatest Bulletin
reader and wonders if I’m still going strong. 1
am; and I do believe I am the greatest reader of
the old red rag. The 308 copies I had at the Yar-
loop mill (W.A.), mentioned bv “Back Block,” made
only a small heap compared with what I had at Menzies
(W.A.). My mate Arthur Duell and I had just
on 500 there. When Vosper was editor of the Sunday
Times he used to give the mill companies hell, and
he got so hot at last that they wouldn’t let the
Times be carried on their trains. That was our
chance —we hopped on the train with 200 Bulletins
of all dates from 1895 to 1898. We sold out—and
got for. our lives, thinking the mob would get to us
tor selling old Bullys. But we heard after that we
could not have done them a better turn, as they
changed the copies with one another till everybody
had read the lot. Five of us once made a coffin for
an unknown with gin-cases, and lined it with Bul-
letins. I remember giving a deadbeat a feed and
an old Bully to read at Jarrahdale mills, in the
south-west of W.A. ; and I saw that same old rag,
with my name on it, three years after iii a wood-
cutters’ camp at Kalgoorlie. One sorrowful incident
was when I lost 40 Bullys in a fire; also a letter I
thought'a lot of from Harry Lawson, who had written
to me on the fields in ’97. We had the best axe-
men in the world in W.A. at the south-west mills—
dim McNully, the Frazer brothers, Dave Winn, the
Daw brothers, the Johnstons, Elliots, Ruths, Gahans,
McLeods, and a lot more. Some of them, 1 sup-
pose, have long since taken out their last chip;
but they were the best lot of mates one wanted to
meet. Poor Jackson went down in the Waratah.
They were all Bulletin readers. In those days a
bush-whacker’s bill-o’-fare was: Tin dog, jam, flour,
tea, sugar, candles, Bulletin and a bottle of pain-
killer. I often sigh for the old camp 1 will never
see again; but when my time comes all I want is
to be wrapped up in the latest old red rag, and I
will chance the rest. P.S. —-Shape this up, Mr.
Editor, as 1 am better with an axe than a pen —•
but it’s all true.
“Old Timer”: According to “F.A.” (B.
14/2/’24) the present-day sheep are bred to suit the
shearers, but I note the recent prize-winners have
been wrinkly—some of them as wrinkly as the old
Vermonts. McCaughey’s sheep in the old days were
called “concertinas” by the shearers, and S’Sam’s
reply was: “That’s the way I make my notes!”
WOULDN'T DECEIVE ELM FOR ANYTHING.
PROSPECTIVE BUYER: “Now, about hill-climbing. Honestly, on
the level —is the Watt a good car?"
SALESMAN: “On the level, sir, it is.”
“Nitric”: The method of catching cane-
beetles at Proserpine (Q.), as quoted by “Mag” (B.
14/2/’24), is far more strenuous and much more
crude than that adopted on the Childers (Q.) cane-
fields. Here the catchers have half a dozen hurricane-
lamps and a few tubs. The latter are half-filled with
water, a small slab is placed across each, and on this
a lamp is rested. Once a man has set his “’traps” all
he lias to do is to journey from tub to tub and
gather in the insects which are attracted by the
light. The price paid is 9d. a pound, and a good
night will give 601 b. of beetle. It’s a darn sight
easier money than following the ploughs to pick up
the cane-grubs, though a sharp-pointed sticker makes
this little job somewhat easier than cotton-picking.
THE CASH PURCHASE.
ENPECK: “I suppose you want me to bring yon the receipt
to show how I spend this."
MRS. ENPECK: "You needn't trouble. Your breath will
be quite enough .”
Dobbin at dessert:
“Tele”: “Talanoa” (B. 7/2/?24). asks why a horse
will only bite bits out of,. a mango on the ground
instead of taking the whole fruit in its mouth, and
mentions that a cow will swallow the lot with im-
punity. The reason is that; the horse ha? an eye.cn
the big seed. A cow will gaily sw 7 allow this knowing
that she will be able to “bring it up” and discharge
it when chewing the cud ; but Dobbin is more careful,
because if he swallows anything it’s got to stay swal-
lowed.
“Quiz”: There are. several mango-trees at the
police-station here, and one of the troop horses picks
up the fruit blown down by the wind and tears the
skin and most of the “flesh” off the seed. He eats
both skin and flesh, but leaves the stone. Although
he is in the same card as the trees and the fruit is
within easy reach, 'i have never seen him touch any
but those on the ground.
* * * *
“Spreader” : Once a horse has acquired
the habit of buckjumping, no matter what caused
the eccentricity, an infallible way of stopping his
antics is to strap a stirrup-leather tightly round
his throat as close to the head as possible. It is
then impossible for the moke to get his head down,
and unless he can do that he can’t “buck’ within
miles of the true meaning of the word.
“Bush Cat”: Re “Huffin-Guffin’s” warn-
ing to new-chum settlers about resting in the shade
of gum-trees in sum-
mer, because of the
danger from falling
limbs (B. 31/l/’24).
in hot weather a large
gum drinks as much
as 300 gallons of water,
probably more, per day.
This is taken up
through the roots and
finally reaches th e
leaves. If there is a
breeze blowing the
moisture is being con-
stantly absorbed; but
if the weather is close
and muggy the absorp-
tion is slower, and, in
consequence, the limbs
become overladen by
the extra weight of
moisture, and, gum
being a timber of very
short grain, a branch
occasionally snaps. If
this is borne in mind
by new-ehums and old
hands alike, there is
little danger to fear
from gum-trees; but
they must remember
that the same thing
applies at night as during the day, only more so,
as there is no sun to help in the evaporation.
■‘Y4R”: I have heard experienced bush-
men and sportsmen who ought to know say that it
is injurious to a rifle to fire gun-shot through it;
on the other hand, I have heard others equally ex-
perienced say that it does no harm at all. I’d like
some guidance from the Council on the matter, as I
am in doubt as to buying shot cartridges for my .22;.
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: The man who said
recently that the wallaby can stand a drought longer
than any other of our bush animals is wrong. The
native-bear can give points to
any Australian animal that 1
know as a drought resister. Dur-
ing the great parch of 1902 I
met Stumpy miles and miles
away from water, and he seemed
none the worse for having to do
without it. In fact, under nat-
ural and normal conditions I
don’t think he drinks at all-
dew and the moisture contained
in the leaves on which he sub-
sists suffice to keep down hik
thiiiST. But in captivity he vviijl
drink, the bears I kept as potk
being very partial to cold, sweet-
ened black tea. |
*
Chloe” : To the late Cap-
tain l’everly, of Balmain (Syd-
ney), is due the introduction of
the buffalo to Northern Aus-
tralia. About 1856 Capt. Mac- 5
Burnie, the chief shipmaster of J
Capt. Beverly’s fleet ot' 26 trad-
ing ships, was despatched from
Sydney in the barque Florence
Street to Burned) and the Malay
States, to bring back a trial ship-
mentl of buffaloes; On the return
journey the vessel ran into a
gale between Timor and Nor’-
W'est Australia, lost her steering
gear, and was carried on to the
reefs near Cambridge Gulf, Mel-
ville Islands. The cattle-pens
between decks gave way, and the
terrified animals had to be forced
overboard. Some were drowned,
others swam ashore; and from
these the present-day herds are
descended. Capt. Macßurnie and
the survivors of the crew made
camp near where Wyndham now
stands, and from there they were
taken later by a pearling schooner,
the skipper of which had heard of
their disaster through some
friendly :ibos. The wreck of the Florence Street lay
on the reefs until the great typhoon of 1887, when it
disappeared.
“Dingle”: Tell “D.H.V.” (B. 27/12/’23)
that distance is not everything in kangaroo-shooting.
One day a man asked the late John Skip worth, the
Westralian, “How far off do you shoot your ’roos?”
“From 40 to 80 yards,” he replied. “But any-
body could shoot them at that distance!” “Yes,”
said John, “but it is not everybody who can get
within 40 yards to do it.” I saw the late Skip-
worth shoot, skin, scalp and peg out 179 in one
day, and maintain an average of 125 a day for 85
days in succession. He pegged out 100,0*00 skins
in 10 years, and all were shot with the .32 Win-
chester (single shot).
“Pat Busliie”: Tell “Centre” (B.
14/2/’24) that huge centipedes are found in most
parts of Australia—his
Bananaland whoppers have
rivals everywhere. Once
in chopping out a pepper-
tree stump 1 found in it
a ’pede a good Bin. long
and half an inch across,
with a steely-blue back.
It was a mother ’pede, and
clinging to her sides were
a number of hairlike ob-
jects—-her babies, which
lost their grip when the
home was shattered with
the axe. Almost immedi-
ately the youngsters let
go she missed them, and
spun round like a willy-
willy in the broken nest,
gathering her brood to her sides, then made off
through the chips and grass to safety.
“Tang-aloli”: Recent references to smart
fencers remind me that during the early ’eighties
Frank Slavin —then a young man in his twenties
and afterwards well known as a fighting man in
America and here —was fencing for me on one
of the heads of the Manning (N.S.W.) in very steep,
hilly country. One day, when posts had been erected
running up a very steep hill, he bored 100 of them
with seven holes each, with an ordinary boring-
brace and five-eighth bit. The posts were about six
inches thick at the ground-level and about four
inches near the top; but as they had to be bored to
the slope of the hill the holes would run to an aver-
age of about six or seven inches. Incidentally, Slavin
came to my head station one day for some requisites
with the leg of his trousers split on the outside
from hip to ankle. To temporarily repair them he
had reeved two bits of No. 10 fencing-wire through
the trouser edges, one from the hip to the knee, and
one from knee to ankle.
"Honest” : “The Bush Lawyer’s” man with
toothache (B. 14/2/’24) reminds me of Henry Hors-
'man, of Sale-road, Gippsland (Vic.). Like all cow-
cockies, he has no nerves and is as tough as leather.
(Troubled with a throat affection, he interviewed a
Sale medico, whose prompt diagnosis was cancer in
the throat, which at any old time might cause the
departure of Henry to a different sphere. Some time
later he met the doctor, who asked him to let him
see his throat. “Good God, man, what has hap-
pened?’’ ejaculated Sawbones when Henry opened
his face. “Oh,"’ was the reply, “you tell me no cure
' for cancer; Igo home, make the poker hot and burn
the blank out.” He had put the almost red-hot iron
down his throat and effectively ridded himself of the
trouble, whatever it was. Although this happened
over 20 years ago old Henry stands up to his tots
of square-face with any of ’em, and there has been
no sign of a recurrence of the malady.
“Tamornie” : I grinned when I read in the
dailies that recent telegram about a crocodile swal-
lowing a man. The largest croc, is incapable of
swallowing even a small dog whole. Incidentally,
is it generally known that a crocodile has no
tongue ?
The reply serious :
“Blackboy” : “Spinifex ll.’’ (B. L4/2/’24) evi-
dently knows very little about the plain country of
the North, or he wouldn’t ask so sarcastically about
how a dingo is run down by means of a motor-car.
Some of the station-properties in W.A. were so big
that a while back the Government brought in a
bill to limit the holdings to “not more than a mil-
lion acres,” and a few had to be cut in halves. On
these runs there are huge plains where logs and
creeks are unknown, and fences are probably 20 miles
apart. A ’roo or dingo has no get-away, and is there-
fore an easy thing for a motor. What few trees do
exist are mulgas—and it takes a whole mulga to
make a fencing-post.
“Tamornie”: There is no secret about, running
dingoes down per motor-car. Just chase them where-
ever it is possible to take the car, over gullies, brush,
etc. That’s how it is done on Brunette Downs, any-
how'. The country here is mostly open downs, but
rough enough to call for skilful driving. Even dogs
sighted at night are not allowed to escape without a
severe run.
“Mypharry” : Last year and the year be-
fore 1 grew a dandy little patch of tobacco, and
spoiled it in the first stage of curing. I cut it
down when the leaves were mottled, let it wilt in
the sun for a few hours, and hung it up in an
open shed to dry. My recipe said that the leaves
would dry manufactured-tobacco color; but in two
months some of the leaves were much the same
as w’hen I hung them up, while others had dried
green like sage and mint and other herbs. Will
some good-natured Abo. put me on the right track?
I’ve a nice little patch this year again, and I don’t
want to spoil it.
“Jock S.T: At Belmont (Lake Macquarie,
N.S.W.) the other day a party set out in a launch
for a trip, leaving Fido, a fox-terrier, at home.
Breaking his little strap, he reached the jetty in
time to see the launch a good half-mile away. With
a yelp he took to the water and set out after hi-
friends. People on the foreshore watched him until
he was out of sight, and naturally concluded he was
drow’ned. But he wasn’t —ho was picked up over
a mile out by a party in a rowing boat. Even
then he was full of going and had to be forcibly
retained. 1 was in the boat myself, otherwise 1
would not have believed it.
THESE ACCIDENTS WILL HAPPEN.
"Had a rotten day. That devil of an office-
boy came to me with the old gag about
getting off for his grand mother's funeral,
so to teach him a lesson I said I'd go
with him.”
“Not bad at all! Was it a good match?”
"No, it was his grandmother's funeral."
“The Rumpus”: Queer animal friend-
ships? I know a weaned foal at Harrietville (Vic.)
that refuses to be parted from a herd of dairy cows.
W hen the milking is over, the juvenile horse takes
his turn in the bail, but is always pained to find that
nobody comes to milk him.
RAIN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A stormy wind is sobbing,
The world is lost in rain!
But how our hearts are throbbing
At last to see again
The bounteous showers teeming
Along the mountain flanks,
To hear the water streaming
into the empty tanks!
Pour down the tinkling treasure,
O skies, a thousandfold;
A month or two will measure
Its worth in minted gold!
Blow, winds, for on your winging
Come greyer, thicker banks—
Sweet clouds of comfort bringing
More water for the tanks!
To no mere human crowing
The muses’ crown belongs ;
’Tis spouting overflowing
That sings the song of songs.
Oh, never artist’s cunning
Spun melody that ranks
With the sound of water running—
Oh, running, running, running,
Into long-empty tanks!

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
BY
GALLET
Perfumes
Soaps
Powders
The Diggers are smiling, not without a
touch of cynical bitterness, at the' sudden
application last week of a two-year-old Eng-
lish Army Order to Australia. This ukase,
which has been consistently honored in the
breach so far, forbids the use of wound
stripes and overseas service chevrons, and
it is obviously timed to synchronise with the
Fleet festivities in Melbourne and Sydney.
The brass-liats—those “unscarred brag-
garts of the war,” as Shakspeare put it in
"Timon"—will no longer be shamed by the
presence of junior officers wearing the decora-
tions that; counted for so much more than
K.B.E.’s and the like. The comparison was
always odious on public occasions; of late
the Base specialists have found it intoler-
able.
It is to be hoped that the committees
which are organising functions for the
Fleet’s visit will not forget that the sailors
don’t bring their girls with them, and when
they arrange dances and so on will see to
it that some partners are invited. When the
French ships were here the sailors had a
frosty time. Someone gave a picnic at which
there was one girl, and at a dance most of
the Jean Matelots had to partner one an-
other.
A conversazione is rather a difficult enter-
tainment to place, so the guests at Parlia-
ment House;- invited to meet -the- Victorian
politicians, might be pardoned if they were
a bit hazy as to correct garb. Many of
the ladies took “full dress” to mean high
collars and long-cuffed sleeves. One couple
brought the baby, though mother rather spoiled
the effect by handing the offspring to daddy
when she went to shake hands with vice-
royalty. Vice-royalty likes babies: Lady de
Chair smiled at this one and tried to tickle
its dimple, but it yelled its protest at the
liberty. Dr. Nash had a big collection of
bronze trophies that the town of Tamworth
has begged from France and Belgium as
war mementoes. He deposited an armful
of them in the Governor’s lap, while he told
of their origin to a chattering, inattentive
throng. It was a vastly entertaining even-
ing from many angles.
The Sunset Cottage Homes committee
captured the lioness of the moment, and pre-
pared a dish of tea at the Women’s Service
Club rooms. It was intended to be a purely
social afternoon; but the guest wanted to
know all about the splendidly-intentioned
society. Mrs. A. V. Roberts, president,
obliged, prefacing the story with a thank-you
for Lady de Chair’s interest. The Dame Hay
helped with the welcome in her charming,
old-fashioned manner. Cream-and-roses com-
plexioned Mrs. Grant accompanied the Gov-
ernor’s lady, who was coolly garbed in ivory
marocain, and wore a broad-brimmed ivory
hat with a big rose set astride a black velvet
riband and a lace draping. She bubbled
over at receiving an armful of roses.
The Governor’s lady has been taken cap-
tive by the aims of the Sunset Homes.
It was easy, she remarked, to get
people to work for children or disabled sol-
diers. but most difficult to get interest in old
people—at least she had found it so in Eng-
land. Judging by the battle the Sunsetters
had last year, it isn’t very different here.
But you’ll probably see a change now. Still,
what matter if a few more indigent old
couples can be furnished with cottages to
spend the twilight in? is?.
The Crown-street Women’s llospitaL'Js
happy in its friends. Lady de ChairWs
now numbered among them —it was at
meeting in its interests, held at Government
House on Tuesday morning, that she had
her first Sydney experience of keeping things
moving. A great crowd attended: a couple
of gross of fold-up emergency chairs could
not hold them all. With the announcement
that the hospital paid no professional collec-
tors and that its expenses were only 3i p.c.
of what it received, and the modest claim
that it was the best equipped obstetric hospi-
tal in the Southern Hemisphere, secretary
Mona Daley got to work on the company to
gather in preliminary expenses for the Paper
and Poster Ball the Wentworth will stage
for the institution on. April 7. Nearly £l5O
was collected straight away; and she had
come with £75 in her wallet. Irene Van-
brugh, Gladys Moncrieff and Dorothy Brun-
ton represented the theatricals, and all three
promised to bring parties to the paper rustle
after their performances.
Tlie Adult Deaf and Dumb Society has
annexed the ear of Lady de Chair, and she
presided at a meeting of the ball committee
at the Mayoress’s rooms. This ball will
follow the Civic jazzy entertainment at the
Town Hall during the Fleet’s visit. The
Mayor was kind enough to send a message
that the Civic committee would leave the
decorations up for £4o—one-third of cost. Con-
sidering that the things would be of no
further use, the Civic committee is very kind
to itself. Such minor details as music,
supper and cloak-rooms having been dis-
cussed, Lady de Chair was rewarded with a
cup of tea. The rooms were beautifully
decorated. The scent of the damask roses
caused little Mrs. Grant, who accompanied
Lady de Chair, to exclaim at their fra-
grance. “And would you believe it,” she
added, “I was told in England that your
flowers, have no scent!” Whereupon some-
body replied: “Well, very few of them
have!” That woman deserves to lose what
little sense of smell she seems to possess.
The Messageries Maritimcs had not only its
biggest ship in port, but also its biggest
working gun, Inspector-General de Cremiers :
and the combination decided the co. to give
a dance on the Cephee on Friday night.
General-manager de Ghampinorin and Capt.
le Flahec received the guests and entertained
them in true French style. The welcoming
carpets and bright lights stretched out on
to No. 2 wharf, at Dawes Point, and palms
and flags enclosed the decks for dancing.
There was a buffet supper from the jump,
and the curacao cup had a flavor that caused
eyes to brighten and tongues to loosen. A
couple of score brown-eyed, black-haired
demoiselles of embryo-deb. age were in the
most fascinating French confections, and the
summer-dress uniforms of the French officers
helped the picture. Mmc. Campana’s em-
bracing smile flashed above a gorgeous robe
of emerald green encrusted with crystals and
iridescent sequins. The Consul-General was
with her, and many of their Sydney-made
friends took the opportunity of saying an
revoi'r, for the popular pair are booked to
leave by the Cephee—and that may mean
good-bye.
Artist Gladys Owen was received into the
bosom of her sister-artists at the club-room
on Thursday afternoon. They all robbed
their gardens to give the returnee a bright
and fragrant welcome. President Ethel
Stephens bestowed the official handclasp;
and then Gladys had some clear-cut informa-
tion to deliver—her platform experience of
recruiting days stands by her still. It was
not surprising to learn that she found that
in the IJ.S.A. art was mostly acquisitive.
America seemed to be content to make its
own art the handmaid of Commerce and go
abroad to buy its immortals. Elsewhere the
trend was towards sensationalism; and with
memories of the “collected exhibition” at
the Town Hall last year nobody was dis-
posed to argue about it.
Dorothy Hinton climbed the well-worn
steps of St. Mark’s in a classic robe of white
moire to meet Keith Eyres, and came down,
beaming, on his arm, after the Rev. Howard
Lea had given them both his blessing. Cousin
Doreen Hordern, niece Edith Forsyth and
Maye Bull made a charming trio of brides-
maids in cyclamen mauve georgette frocks
featuring the newest mode of pelisse frills
and mammoth hip bows of cyclamen ribbon.
Black hats rather swamped the flower effect.
Here’s a lucky girl, for she has both
brains and beauty. Her name is Beryl
Alexander, and May Moore made this pie-
ture of her
the other day.
Just IS, Beryl
has decided to
follow Matri-
mony instead
of Music,
which was her
objective i n
1922, when she
Avon a Royal
Academy
Scholarship for
piano. She Avill
not make use
of that scholar-
ship now, be-
cause before
the year is out,
all going well,
she will be the
wife of violin-
ist Mis c h a
Dobrinski.
Beryl studied
stage work with Nellie Stewart and Walter
Bentley, and made a striking first appear-
ance as Mildred Douglas in “The Hairy
Ape”; and she is to be cast for another
important part with the Playbox people.
Grahame Sands, of the John Sands director-
ate, smiled very proudly down on a lovely
vision that stood beside him at St. James’s
Church steps one evening last week. It
was Nellie, eldest daughter of the H. N.
Ellises, of Chatswood, and she made her
promises in gleaming ivory charmeuse and
silver lace. Sisters Enid and Edith heard
the vows, while Chisholm Cameron and
Frank Leverrier, jun., stood beside the
’groom. The cake was cut at the Cavalier
and the honeymoon is being consumed in
Tasmania.
The youngest of the Numa Jouberts’ sons,
Albert, took a wife at the beginning of the
month. She was Vera Cowley, third daugh-
ter of the Percy Cowleys, of Goondiwindi
(Q). The knot 'was tied at Christ Church,
Tenteriield, and the reception was held at
Old Tonterfield House, Mr. and Mrs. Albert
Joubcrt will live at Tirranna, Tweed River.
The Jouberts are descendants of the original
French settlers at Hunter’s Hill. Grand-
pere Joubcrt started the Lane Cove River
service about the time that the Jeannerets
started the Parramatta ferry; and, queerly
enough, when the British Govt, invited a
handful of Oversea editors to see for them-
selves how matters were going in France dur-
ing the war, it was another Joubert, a con-
nection of the family, who was detailed to
take them to the French lines outside Chat-
eau Thierry.
If you’ve ever been in Long Bay—lots
of good people have—you don’t need an
introduction to Ted Wright, entertainer.
Regularly he
brings his new
“piece” out to
the gaol, for
he loves his
audience there
best of all.
And his audi-
enc e s liav'e
included Gov-
ernors, Cardi-
nals, I. WAVs,
and such per-
sonages. One
time he was
asked to do a
turn for a big
I.W.W. meet-
ing in the
Town Hall.
Certainly, he
said, and gave
the passage in
“The Ever-
lasting Mercy”
descriptive of a man maddened with drink
and despair. It was a tremendous success.
Later the same evening, in Waverley, for
a Protestant society, Ted did the exquisite
part of the same work describing the effects
and working of God’s grace. : The Pas-
sionist Fathers at Mari'iokville often rc-
(inisition him for a complete rendering of
this poem, and he treasuYes a gold matchbox
given him by Walter Davidson, the well
beloved, at the conclusion of one of his
recitals. Those clever amateurs, “Ye
Idlers,” have Ted for one of their number.
Bessie Leonard, of Bellevue Hill, and Wil-
liam Fraser, of Eulo, on the south-west line,
brought the Rev. Hugh Buntine all the way
from Armidale to make them one at Scots’
Church on Saturday night. The bride and
her quintette of ’maids all wore ivory frocks,
the ’maids gleaning color from tulle head-
dresses and bouquets. Afterwards five gal-
lants escorted them to the Wentworth, where
the wedding meats were set. The honey-
mooners are on their way to Tasmania.
Gwyneth Faithfull and Guy Raymond—
he is of Scone—-have agreed to face the altar
together at an early date. The bride-elect,
of the Goulburn clan, has won a few tro-
phies at country picnic races that will
ornament the connubial sideboard.
The Henry dancing twins have a dissolu-
tion of partnership pending. June has
accepted a diamond pledge from Stanley
Legge, second son of Major-General Legge—
the eldest boy was killed early in the Great
War. The mother of the jolly little twins
has the post of “social hostess” at the Am-
bassadors.
Bobbie McMillan, daughter of the knight,
has booked March 28 for her marriage with
actor Frank Harvey.
The Hon. Mrs. Henry Edwardes, news of
whose death has arrived by cable, “was fol-
lowed to her grave in St. Martin’s-in-the-
Fields by many Australians.” She deserved
to be. This admirable woman was the origi-
nator of the idea of looking after Dominion
soldiers, which eventually developed into a
fashionable craze. She wanted no adver-
tisement out of what she regarded as a kind
of mission, and got none; yet it is doubtful if
any one Englishwoman throughout the war
did more for the men of all ranks or gave
more comfort to the relatives of those who
fell.
Laurence Godfrey Smith is a very sad
pianist. The cabled news came through last
week that his mother had died in Switzer-
land. His father and sister were with her,
and are now on their way home. The de-
ceased lady used to be Alice Morey, of
Levuka, in Fiji.
The Queen Vic. Homes committee came
out of its hiding last week and sent its
annual report abroad. At the sanatoriums
at Thirlmere (for women) and Wentworth
Falls (for men) it goes on with its good work
of trying to restore consumptives to health.
Its mission is not in vain, for last year Thirl-
mere sent 72 women and Wentworth Falls
81 men healed into the work-a-day world
again. Richard Teece, in the chair, nodded
approval over the medical report; and every-
one looked wistful when G. F. Earp con-
tended that the Government should provide
for the patients’ dependants, and so lighten
the society’s job.
Another even more unobtrusive body
which held its annual meeting was the After-
care Association. It gives its kindly atten-
tion to those discharged from mental hospi-
tals. Of necessity it is an unostentatious
charity, and consequently suffers sadly from
lack of funds. The Chief Justice’s lady pre-
sided and announced that the Governor was
to be a patron. Anyone who feels disposed
to help will find Miss Moses, organising sec-
retary, at the Equitable Buildings.
Mrs. Hugh Munro, who put the Country
Women’s Association on the map and is its
live-wire president, returned by the Niagara
from a few months’ sojourn in the little
kingdom of Tonga. She was the guest of
Minister for Works A. B. Wallace and his
wife. To any tired soul seeking dolcc far
niente Mrs. Munro recommends Tonga. It is
so quiet that one can hear the grass dreaming.
There are no dances, no picture-shows even.
The mail from Sydney comes but once a
month, and wireless news never has a thrill.
It. was well that Mrs. Munro took her fill
of rest. The C.W.A. has kept her in per-
petual motion since she returned.
Town-planner John Sulman and his wife
and girls are off to the Empire Exhibition.
The Town Planners gave John a luncheon at
Farmer’s to voice good wishes. The George
Taylors were co-guests of honor. lie knows
more about wireless than most people, and is
taking his wireless-picture invention and a
few other inspirations to get the seal of
London’s approval on them. The female
half of the Sulman menage were the queens
at a party at the Jacobean Rendezvous on
Friday. The Armenian Relief committee
arranged the happy affair, at which Mrs.
Sulman received an approving pat for her
Red Cross and other charity and patriotic
work, as well as an armful of flowers.
The women’s farewell to Mrs. Florence
Taylor took almost a third of the Ambassa-
dors’ lunching space on Monday. Premier
Fuller’s lady, in a small hat bristling With
ospreys or near-ospreys, presided, and in an
after-coffee speech told Mrs. Taylor that
she would come back to proclaim Australia
the best place in the world. Mrs. Trefle,
with a fine brogue, hinted to Mrs. Taylor
that she was a fine woman, and there were
about a hundred vigorous nods of approval.
The guest, with a break in her voice and
moisture in her eyes, looked round and
picked out the old friends who had known
her as E'lorence Parsons, first the studious
girl, then the budding architect, finally the
full-blown professional.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Sir Matthew has packed his bag for Sydney, and
will he some weeks away from his regular bear.
Before departing he Went to a “ladies’ night” at the
Brisbane Club, With Lieut. Turner following on.
On March 5 his Ex.’s very real regret accompanied
the wreath which he sent to follow J. H. R. Lewis,
of the Telegraph, to Toowong. The late journalist,
who had been 36 years with the paper, had a very large
company on his last journey through the streets he
knew so well. Lewis died practically at his post.
He supervised the first five-o’clock edition the office
had ever issued. That was on the 3rd. On the 4th
the paper had the black-lined notice that “J.H.R.”
had collapsed and died in a private hospital that
afternoon.' A widow, two daughters and two sons
survive.
William Johnson, the new head of the Royal Auto-
mobilites, arranged that President’s Day should be
held at Lawnton. About 100 cars went out Strath-
pine way, and archery was one of the sports of the
afternoon.
The Sanderson Furaiss pair have been here. The
Oxford don wanted to see how they “do things” under
Labor in Bananaland.
For Meta Brookes, who is going to be married
soon, Leith Graham staged a tea at Lennon’s; and
Mrs. Gordon Graham poured the fragrant Bohay
for the voyaging G. D. Logan dame, who left with
her husband for Sydney on the 7th to catch the
Niagara for the U.S.A. Mrs. Edgely also tea-ed
Mrs. Logan at Lennon’s.
The Ross Munros go by the Osterley in June, and
Mrs. J. Anning and sister (Mabel Lloyd) are also off
to the Cold Country.
The L. M. McKillops, before they sailed for Europe,
asked their pals to a dinner-dance set among cart-
loads of red roses at the Bellevue. An electric
“Coo-ee” was cunningly veiled in some of these
blooms. Chief Justices, doctors and country visitors
were present.
For Lyle Johnson, who married Douglas Harding
the other day, 12 women members of the Taringa
Croquet Club borrowed the pretty Phillips home and
held a “china tea.” Bouquets, floral and verbal,
were presented, and the bride got all kinds of china-
ware—useful, ornamental and both.
The Trocadero was decked in autumn leaves and
spring green when it reopened for jazz. Gloria
Arndell, of the Diggers Co., staged the Prince o
Wales fox-trot; and a dancer who remained masked
added a touch of mystery to the gambols. The
bawbees went to the Children’s Hospital.

Men Who Care
For whiter teeth are now fighting film
Wherever you go among careful people
you see teeth that glisten now. Millions of
people every day combat the dingy film.
This test will show you how. The results
will amaze and delight you. Make it for
your own sake, now.
Those dingy coats
Film is that viscous coat you feel. Much
of it resists the tooth brush, clings and stays.
Soon the film discolors, then it forms dingy
coats which hide the lustre of the teeth.
Film also causes most tooth troubles It
holds food substance which ferments and
forms acid. It holds the acid in contact
with the teeth to cause decay.
Germs breed by millions in film. They,
with tartar, are the chief cause of pyorrhea.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

Price: 2/- and 1/3
Few people escaped these troubles. So
dental science has found two ways to daily
fight that film. One acts to disintegrate the
film, the other to remove it without harmful
scouring.
After many careful tests these methods
were adopted. A new-type tooth paste was
created to apply them daily. The name is
Pepsodent. Now leading dentists the world
over are urging its adoption.
Watch its effects
Pepsodent also multiplies the alkalinity
of the saliva as well as the starch digestant
in saliva. Those agents are there to con-
stantly fight acids and digest starch deposits
on teeth.
Thus Pepsodent does essential things
which old ways cannot do. The results are
quickly seen and felt.

Lady Pat Blackwood, who set the tea-
cups vibrating by hopping on to the J.C.W.
boards, plaintively explains that this is not
a joy-ride, but a purely business proposi-
tion, which will enable her to earn her own
crust. The Dufferin family has been im-
poverished by a too-quick change of heirs, as
well as by the Irish trouble, and Lady Pat
does not want to be dependent on her step-
father, Earl Howe. She has inherited a lot
of American independence from her mother.
Furthermore she thinks it possible that her
leaning towards stage life may be an inheri-
tance from her Sheridan forebears. Per-
haps the likeness to the late Albanesi is not
so noticeable to the ordinary eye as it was
to George Tallis, who seems to have had it
well in mind when he made his offer to the
marquis’s daughter. Anyway, Lady Pat is
a bright, attractive young thing, though with
a good deal of the simple dignity of her
aunt, Lady Novar, and it is quite possible
that she might turn up trumps in her stage
career. Sister Doris, now married and a
mother, and little cousin Veronica, daughter
of the present holder of the marquisate, will
be thrilled to hear of the great adventure.
Both loved their years in Australia, especi-
ally little Veronica, who repeatedly sighs to
be back again. Lady Pat’s father became heir
to the title when his brother, Lord Ava,
was killed in the Boer War, and when he
died without a son Veronica’s dad, then
Lord Frederick Blackwood, came in for the
marquisate, in place of his brother Basil,
who was killed in the Great War.
The G.-G. and Lady Forster brought a
large party to “The Cabaret Girl” to see
Lady Pat.’s stage debut. These included the
Dunleaths and Lady Ellen Lambert. The
group being an outsize for the official pen,
the overflow was somehow accommodated in
other parts of the house. The link between
Government House and the stage seemed to
put the two on a more intimate footing, and
gent.-helps buzzed round the house in quite
a friendly way. Half Toorak poured itself
into the theatre for the surprising occasion.
Lady Pat., who, although new to the game,
was neve.r gauche, took her first limelight in
a ravishing whirl of white crepe bordered
with fur and a little hat of bright blue vel-
vet. Her next appearance was in a start-
ling lilac taffeta, the straight-jacketed top
veiled in georgette, and yards of silk flaring
madly below the knees. A little grey hat
wreathed with colored blossoms was washed
on one side with a flutter of hanging crim-
son ribbon. In her last frock of orange
velvet and shaded ostrich feathers she looked
like a gorgeous golden bird ; but her winding
velvet tail once or twice threatened to trip
up her twinkling feet during the final-curtain
dance. /
One wondered at the second day’s racing
at Flemington how so many young men could
get off for the afternoon. The Turkish-bath
atmosphere had melted the projected autumn
dress parade and sent the sex back to voile
and georgette ; but if the summery wear was
without anything sensational, it at least
added to the color of the landscape. The
vice-regal pen was heavily peopled by both
Government Houses and some of the Most
Gilded. Lady Forster, whose dark-blue
silken trappings were brightened by a floral
hat-wreath, got tangled up with the crowd at
the rear of the stand as she wandered back
after the mid-day feed. The Countess Strad-
broke draped her length with a harmonious
blend of brown and sapphire, and had a
blue feather perched backways on her hat.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers enveloped the upper storey
of her white crepe with pale embroideries
surfacing a little coatee. Little Eileen Bell,
from Queensland, came out in a dusky
frock; Lady Dunleath flew blue plumes from
the rear of her brown hat, topping her brown
marocain : and Lady Ellen Lambert, in blue
and white foulard, supported ostrich
feathers on. her multi-colored velvet lid. It was
like old times to see the silver-haired Millie
Carter back at Flemington after many years
spent oversea, with her inseparable pal, the
C. M. Lloyd widow.
Thursday’s barometer indicated rain;
therefore few of the women dared to risk
their new frocks. Lady Forster and Lady
Stradbroke both struck a black note with
their dresses, but the former sported a blue
hat feather. Lady Dunleath cheered her
black with red beads, Mrs. Pitt Rivers hers
with a paddy-green hat. The Seymour
Hickses—she in black —were duly thrilled
with the glories of Flemington, and both
were beckoned into the vice-regal enclosure.
Admiral Hall-Thompson’s wife flattered
ficelle georgette with a mole-feathered hat.
It was cool and cloudy for the finish of
the meeting on Saturday. Although only a
small percentage of the best dressers risked
their new season’s tailorings, the terrace
blazed with hundreds of variations of
Joseph’s famous coat. Some short, some
long, but all barred downways or across
with many colors, while more than half
had fur borders. The most arresting of
these covered the Everard Brownes’ eldest
girl—a loose liip-length jacket crossed with
stripes and hemmed in with fur. Above
this the wearer tucked her dark head into
what looked like a schoolboy’s badged cap
of wine-colored velvet, with a huge velvet
ear spouting from either side. One inter-
state visitor, in a jacket with magpie
stripes, flew a whole bunch of scarlet
feathers from her lid, and several expen-
sively chiffoned women defied the anti-
plumage regulations with bird-of-paradise
feathers dripping over their hat brims. All
the Very Best were there, and the vice-regal
cabin overflowed as usual during the gallops.
Lady Forster was browned like a cinnamon
stick, with feathers fringing her hat-brim,
and the Countess Stradbroke flew a berib-
boned hat with her inky dress. The others
in the two parties all aired chiffons which
have come in for previous mention.
Mrs. Byron Moore was in a becomiug
blue cloak and black hat, and daughter
Linda in navy tailorings. Mrs. William
Leonard, in the committee box with her
veteran horse-racing husband, aired a smart
black dress. Dr. Charlie Ryan was uti-
lising the meeting to farewell his friends
before' boarding the mail steamer. Last
week he dashed to Sydney to see an old
pal, and, after an hour and a half over the
teacups, boarded the express back to Mel-
bourne. Dr. Alex. Noyes, dapper and
smiling as usual, put in an appearance; but
the old social brigade is rapidly getting sub-
merged under the new. Big W. .J. T. Clarke
wandered down the terrace, and smart flap-
pers flapped all over the place, even in the
betting ring.
On Friday the sporting vice-regal countess
dispensed tea at the final polo contest on the
Moonee Valley course. It was quite an in-
formal affair. There was no reception of
the invited, who just handed in their gilt-
lettered invitations at the entrance and
snatched the food without further ado.
This is Lucius Conolly, who lately invaded
the stage and now helps to brighten that
delectable show, “The Man in Dress
Clothes.” Sailor, soldier, journalist and ex-
nlorer, this
young man of
many parts is
a son of one
of Victoria’s
oldest families.
His maternal
g v a n d father
Ffrcnch owned
Monivea sta-
tion, near
Hamilton, and
was famed in
days of old for
his large-
hearted hospi-
tality. The
run was called
after the an-
cestral castle
in Ireland,
which is still
in the family.
The Bob
Power widow
is Lucius’s aunt. She and his mother, Mrs.
J. W. Conolly (Mary Ffrench that was),
were the two crack horsewomen of their
day. Vandyck is responsible for the photo.
On Ladies’ Day—the very first one—at
the Naval arid Military Club, the members
offered a glad greeting to the visiting Har-
rowby pair and Lady Frances Ryder, in
recognition of what the peer and his family
did for Anzac officers in Blighty. The
president, General Monash, with daughter
Bertha, and the vice-president, Col. Apple-
ton and his other half, received the feminine
invasion on the stairway of the Club’s new
home in Alfred-place, which sheltered the
German Chib in pre-war days. Lady ITar-
rowby was in flowery biscuit-colored silk,
and daughter Frances in a neat grey rig,
and each was handed a presentation posy of
patriotic hue. The whole ■ company was
presented to the star guests before the tea-
pouring, at which Surgeon-General Charlie
Ryan was called on to make an eighth at
the official board. After General Monash’s
welcoming speech the visiting trio all made
modest reference to their overseas work,
speaking with a simple sinceritv streaked
with a nice humor. Generals Foott and
McGlynn and their wives were in the crowd,
sis were Captain D.vett and Mrs. George
.Tames, who was a Harrowby guest in her
M .A.A.C.-commanding days. In the absence
ot the club sec., his understudy, P. W.
lowell, saw that everything ran smoothly.
It happened at a Government House. Her
Ex. had summoned to her hospitable after-
noon-tea tables a company of Best People
to help along a charity in which she is in-
terested. All the guests were imbued with
a desire to serve their fellows; some were
all the better able to do so because their
husbands had “climbed.” It was when the
sandwich trifles and diaphanous bread-and-
butter had been eaten that the tidy and
helpful instincts of one of these good souls
betrayed her into letting domesticity show
through the preciously-prized social veneer.
As the footman approached her table she
deftly “stacked” the used china and slid all
the surplus sandwiches neatly on to one
plate. Polite conversation paused at the
horror of the thing, the air grew cold, and
a reconstruction of the committee is pending.
Rembrandt made this picture of Jean
Sutherland, the budding Victorian artist who
has topped off five years as a National Gal-
lery Student under Bernard Hall by carrying
off the Travelling Scholarship. Sep Power,
John Longstaff and Charles Wheeler, who
judged the ex-
hibits, were
very definite
in their praise
of her honor-
winning can-
vas, “The New
Recipe.” The
little paintress,
who is the
only daughter
of G. A. Suth-
erland, of Glen-
garry, Garden
Vale, comes of
a talented
family. Two
cousins, Ruth
and Jean
Sutherland, are
well- known
artists, and it
was from
them she re-
ceived her
earliest training; pianist Margaret Sutherland
is another cousin, and so is Brenda Suther-
land, of the School of Domestic Economy.
Portrait painting is Jean’s line, but she is
ready to tackle landscape or figure work.
She will pack her paint-box shortly and
steam off for her two scholarship years in
London, Paris and other art centres.
Shoals of the Best Known helped to fill
the Theatre Royal on Saturday night to wel-
come Bluebeard’s eighth wife to this city.
The Stradbrokes were boxed with the John
Winter-Irvings, the tireless Countess in all-
blhck, a brilliant comb brightening her head
with its new Madonna hair-parting. The
golden-haired Irving matron glittered in
sequined _ black. Gertrude Elliott ap-
peared in a succession of enviable
frocks, varied by a less becoming suit of
striped pyjamas. The first act saw her in
white marocain inlet with squares of black
silk embroidery, under a knitted silk coatee
of magpie stripes, and a black satin hat.
Then she changed into an alluring caped
gown of rose velvet, hemmed with fur; but
even the rosy glories of this paled before
the sumptuous attractions of its successor,
an evening gown of gold tissue shot with
lilac falling in straight folds from one white
shoulder, but captured midway by a wide
circlet of chased silver. She took her last
call in black-bordered white ninon frillings
vividly patched with the scarlet of her hat
and leather handbag. The latter, which con-
cluded in a cascade of fringe, was swung
from one shoulder.
Dr. Nyulasy and his sisters have been
plunged into mourning by the death of their
brother, Dr. Ai’thur Nyulasy, of Westralia,
who passed out at their Toorak home after
several weeks on the sick list. He was
taken ill_ suddenly in Perth on the eve of
his crossing to Melbounie for the Medical
Congress; but after some days in hospital he
faced the journey to spend his last days with
his relatives. The elder sister, Mrs. Cooper,
and her husband, lately back from three
years oversea, cancelled their return to
Maoriland to be with the invalid.
A cold wind bore down on the finals of the
M.C.C. tennis tournament on Saturday, and
only the overcoated and the brave faced the
blast in the top tiers of the stands. Powdered
noses peeped from furs, the toque and
tailor-made were popular, and a wliite-coated
lad trying to sell an ice-creamy confection
was wnder a drum-fire of murderous glances.
Many of the ladies were interested in “Soss”
Wertheim’s new sweater, with red and yellow
facings, because it was such a change from
his melancholy face. Also there was a con-
centrated stare at Mrs. Utz, the nimble little
Sydneysider with nigger-brown neck and
arms. When she powders her face for battle
the effect is a little disconcerting.
Dame Nellie having got here too late for
the Fritz Hart productions of Purcell’s
“Dido and iEneas,” at the Playhouse, it has
been decided to re-stage the opera for the
Melba approval on Saturday night.
It is just as well that prima-donna Toti
dal Monte has decided to leave her dog at
home, because no one knows what complica-
tions might result if the tyke were landed in
Australia. If it happened to catch rabies or
was rim over, the Firm could count on her
going into vociferous mourning for the rest
of the tour. The Latin’s passionate love of
pets often takes the weirdest forms. A tenor
who came to Australia a few years back was
devoted to a tame tortoise. The beast was
named Umberto, after royalty, and its master
housed it in his room. One night the warbler
failed to turn up at the theatre, and a hurried
messenger sent to his room found him bowed
in sorrow over the dead favorite. A gentle
suggestion that he was -wanted brought forth
a torrent of language. “I no sing, I no sing,'’
he wailed. “No! No! No! I no sing. 11
mio povero Umberto, ’e die of de ’ome-seek.
I grief for a veek!” And he did.
The wedding of John Douse Langley, a
grandson of Bishop J. D. Langley, was fixed
for the 12th, the bride being Marjorie
McLean, a daughter of the late Allan
McLean, a former Premier of ours, and
half-Prime Minister with George Reid.
Grandpa Langley was to be the locksmith.
Langley, jun., is in partnership with young
Tom Weigall—son of the well-known law-
yer—in a grazing farm at Howqua, near
Mansfield.
The attractive wife of Canadian Com-
missioner Ross, who is off with her hus-
band for a few months of his native land,
was cheered on her way by Mrs. Monty
Grover, with a gay little lunch-party at
the Quamby Club. The principal guest en-
folded her slim elegance in black satin under
a droopy little hat brim, and Mrs. Grover’s
black-braided coatee, topping navy tailorings,
wore a golden glitter at the collar and sleeve
hems. It looked like the feminine of a
Hussar jacket and was accompanied by an
engagingly beribboned hat.
The sick benefit end of the Blind Asy-
lum’s activities, which has been sagging a
bit on the financial side, will get a nice
prop from a sparkling revue show staged in
the Ormond Hall the other evening. Fully
a thousand people braved a wet night to
pack the hall and shower thunderous
applause on the players—a group of medical
undergrads, helped by a whole constellation
of professional and semi-professional stars.
After the final curtain the performers re-
ceived the reward of virtue in the shape of
a supper. Mrs. James Angus, who had organ-
ised the entertainment, defied the weather
and her doctor by climbing out of a sick bed
to see that the thing went off successfully.
The Montgomery sisters are back in their
Malvern home after several months of motor-
ing about Britain and the Continent. After
combing London and Paris for the latest
modern dances, they are now broadcasting
the gratifying information that the jazz has
been hunted out of London’s West End, while
the fox-trot and one-step have been pruned
of all exotic digressions, and speeded up to
a gay chassee, with a straight run down the
dance floor. Stunting is now left to the
vulgar crowds, likewise the bunny-hug method
of grabbing partners. At an ultra-smart
ball they attended at the Paris Ritz, a
negro orchestra played in one dance-room
and an all-white band in the other.
The music was a special feature, but the
American nigs, did not use one jazz instru-
ment or their voices in the making of it.
Neither did the whites.
A little gossip from Adelaide: —
Woe is us, and especially woe is Port Adelaide,
out to do its hospitable best for the Fleet, and now
plunged in the depths by the intimation that its
river is too tortuous for the light cruisers. And
woe, too, is the feminine committee that is running
the dances for the officers and men, for with the
Repulse and the Hood anchored somewhere out at
sea, and the boisterous wind still blowing (as it has
been for most of the summer), there is every chance
of all sorts of arrangements going phut!
The Melba visit to Government House is ofF, too;
at least, it is temporarily postponed, as business
holds Dame Nellie in Melbourne.
The Elder Scholarships for violin and singing go
to Charlotte Grivell and Esma Roach —the latter a
twelve-year damsel who learnt to handle her fiddle
under Gerald Walenn; the former already known
as soloist of one of our Scotch church choirs.
The United Arts Club, which has Van Raalte as
its president, is now a fully-fledged association, and
is making the May Club its headquarters. The
membership is wide enough to include those inter-
ested in art as well as artists, and there is a
sprinkling of women’s names on its books.
Ada Reeve was hostess at the Grand Central the
other afternoon, the occasion being her birthday,
the frivol a the dansant, and the guests some of
the Aladdin eo., with a local stiffening.
The sale of Benacre passed it into the hands of
the Lance Lewises (he is the youngest son of popu-
lar old John, its late owner) ; but most of the land
has been cut up into smallish blocks. Before John
Lewis the late Henry Scott was Benaere’s owner,
and before him T. B. Strangways. The comfortable
old house has seen some entertaining in its day.
Another Adelaide suburban home becomes a chari-
table institution-—Morialta, the old residence of R-
C. Baker, the first President of the Federal Senate.
It has been in possession of his son, but now
becomes an Orphan Home under specifically Protes-
tant management. It is an ideal site in the hills,
close to Norton Summit, and the lower part of the
gully to which it gives its name is a public reserve
under the management of the Tramways Trust.

Efficient Belting
Means More Power Delivered.
Do you realise to what extent the difference between power generated and
Power actually delivered increases your costs of production and eats into
profits? Efficient belting can do much to decrease this wasted power.
PIONEER LEATHER BELTING
has for sixty-six years been standardised for all industrial power-transmission
purposes. The illustration shows the largest driving belts in Australia-
one 48in. and three 34in. Pioneer Double-cemented Leather Belts supplied

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
After the result of the Y.R.C. Leonard
Stakes (almost another Newmarket in the size and
quality of the field), the importance of the draw for
positions seems unquestionable. Sonora, who drew a
bad marble in the Newmarket, was first favorite for
the Leonard on the strength of her getting a billet
dose. to the outside rails. The slick mare didn’t
quite win, but she finished second, where Blackadder
(who didn’t start this time) had finished in the New-
market. Fore and aft of Sonora came Quintus and
t'na Carlos. They had drawn lovely' marbles, as in
the Newmarket, and they filled the same places at
the finish. The six first horses in the Leonard, con-
sidered in relation to their positions at the barrier,
amounted to a powerful argument in favor of high
marbles. They were Quintus (24), Sonora (21), Una
Carlos (22), The Monk (7), Bawra (23) and 1
Miranton (20).
Harvest King, an uncertain customer in the spring,
is always worth following in the autumn. The black -
or-brown stallion won the Governor’s Plate in pretty
smart time for the 12 furlongs, but on the assumption
that he couldn’t run two good races within two days,
and would hardly stay out the two miles if the pace
was hot, the books offered 9 to 4 against his taking
the King’s Plate for the third year in succession.
The idea seemed to be that Maid of the Mist would make
the pace as usual, and that Frances Tressady would
outstay the old ’uns at the finish. As it happened, the
pace was deadly slow at the outset, Harvest King’s
jockey being allowed to ride a waiting race in front.
He skilfully slowed down the field, and the King was
enabled to lead the show from first to last, winning
by half a head from The Rover. Wren’s chestnut
got his head in front for a moment, but Harvest King
had another effort left in him, and regained the lost
inches, whilst Frances Tressady was suffering from
inability to make up a lot of lost ground in a little
time. The pretty filly is not quite brilliant, and the
time—3min. 35sec. —was all against a stayer, assum-
ing she is a stayer. On the Australian Cun running
she should have beaten both The Rover and Harvest
King, both of whom had run away with the 2} miles
race when they were younger and carried compara-
tively easy weights. But then, the Australian Cup
this year was run in record time, and stamina went
for everything in the last two furlongs. The pace
beat Englefield in the Cup, though he finished up
the week by winning another 12-furlong event bril-
liantly. Like Wvnette, this son of old George Frede-
rick stays well up to a mile and a half.
Excuses are still being made for The Cypher, who,
after his Cup failure, was backed to win the King’s
Plate at w.f.a. The stodgy little son of Martian
hasn’t grown a quarter of an inch since he bumped
against King Ingoda in a Melbourne Cup. He shows
no intelligence in buffeting his wav through a field.
The Cypher is horn to “bad luck.” Nor is he any-
thing of a weight-carrier on his public form these
last two years. Tons of money have been lost on
Eccles’s horse and more will be lost if the public
continues to regard him as a champion, and the
handicappers go on encouraging the notion.
Two days after his defeat in the seven-furlongs
•Sires’ Produce Stakes, Heroic carried his 101 b. penalty
in the Ascot Vale Stakes like a champion. But the
A.V.S. is a six-furlongs go, and the doubt as to
whether he is a Derby colt remains.
"Fax” : Whilst Accarak, so long despised,
has been improving out of knowledge, his younger
brother Whittier has seemingly lost brilliancy.' Their
sister Etiwanda, two years younger than Whittier,
opened her account by winning unexpectedly at
Flemington, but she also may prove difficult to get
cherry-ripe until she’s a five-year-old.
"0.K.” : The result of the Australian Cup
was strictly according to history. Once in the past
18 years had the winner carried over 8 stone, and
then it was only Bst. lib. Last year the average
weight of the place-getters was 7st. 51b., which of
late years had been rarely exceeded; this time it
was exactly 7st. 71b., including 71b. penalty the
winner carried for having won a distance race since
declaration of weights. Considering that stavers
of some account were in the race on favorable terms
it was mere flying -in the face of reason to back
such as Harvest King (9st. 21b.), The Cypher (Bst.
Hlb.), Wynette (Bst. 131 b.) and The Rover (Bst.
91b.). Heavyweights never had a chance. Probably
the change of climate proved disastrous to Clan
Robert, otherwise the hurdler from Sydney might
have rivalled old Jackstaff iii the running. That
anything could hate beaten Accarak on the day
seems hardly likely. It being now proved that the
brother to Whittier is
an honest stayer,
there can be no deny-
ing that he was thrown
into the race at his
original handicap of
7st. lib. A seven-
pounds penalty made
practically no differ-
ence, for Duncan
aboard was worth a
few pounds extra. The
five-year-old that had
run a good third to
Bitalli and Rivoli in
the Melbourne Cup
(with 6st. 91b.) was
surely worth more than
7st. lib. in the Aus-
tralian. Apparently the
handicapper suffered
from the weird delu-
sion that Accarak’s per-
formance in the Mel-
bourne Cup was a
“fluke.” But these un-
expected thirds in Mel-
bourne Cups never are
flukes.
DICK O’CONNOR,
trainer of Braehead
and Clan Robert.
Owners of first-class horses with their
reputations made get no encouragement from the
A.J.C. handicapper to start them in races like the
Doncaster and the Epsom. Two years ago Beauford
headed the Doncaster weights with lOst. 51b., Gloam-
ing and Eurythmic coming next with lOst. 41b. This
year The Hawk tops the list with lOst. 31b., and
then come Crowdennis (9st. 131 b.), Olaro (9st.
111 b.), Easingwold f(9st. 61b.) and Whittier (9st.
51b). The Hawk never looked like winning the
Epsom with 9st. 71b., and in spite of his recent
w.f.a. successes (they were all made easy for him) he
has hardly deserved a rise of 101 b. In any case, he
is not likely to start. Otacre (9st. 41b.) is a
weight-carrier, and a mile should be well within
the compass of such a strong finisher. He and Duke
Isinglass (9st.) look the best of the 9st. division,
and the most attractive eight-stoner is Blackadder
(Bst. 11b.), who will carry a ton of money if he
stands up to his work. Also, a fortune will be risked
on Trilisa provided she indicates, between now and
April 19, that she can go a mile. In the six-
furlongs Breeders’ Plate at the last A.J.O. Easter
meeting the beautiful daughter of Trillion, receiving
no more than the sex allowance, galloped clean away
from Quintus; in the Doncaster the colt has 9st.
11b. and the filly 7st. 9lb. Buckra (7st. 21b.) is
an improving horse apd may have a rough chance.
David won the last Sydney Cup with 9st. 71b.,
and perhaps the handicapper couldn’t have given him
less than 9st. 131 b. this time, although he failed in
the Melbourne Cup with 9st. 101 b. But the big
brown is getting no younger, and Fred Power is to
be preferred at 9st. 21b. If Fred isn’t a good one
there is no going on appearances. Acearak (Bst.
61b.) and Kingslot (Bst. 51b.) will be specked in
doubles; but El Dorado (Bst. lib.) will meet the
Woorak gelding on 121 b. better terms than in the
Australian Cup, and that ought to bring them to-
gether. In El Dorado’s case, and that of another
slug in Balaton (7st. 91b.), weight is a less important
factor than condition and jockeyship. Wallace
Mortlake has a chance with 7st. 71b. if he is any-
thing like the horse he is reputed to be, and
7st. 51b. is a nice weight for Comptroller, third in
the Metropolitan and first in the Waverley Handicap.
And the handicapper has been comparatively light
•on the three-year-olds. A year ago he gave Rivoli
and The Cypher Bst. 71b., Whittier and Caserta
Bst. 61b. and Kingslot Bst. 41b. ; on the present
occasion Shrapnel and Frances Tressady get 7st. 101 b.,
Drongo 7st. 91b., Lady Valais, Sandringham and the
South Australian colt Stand By, 7st. 71b. Though
Shrapnel has gone wrong again and been withdrawn,
it would not be surprising to see three-year-olds—
Trilisa and Drongo, say-—win the double. But it
might be less risky to back a seasoned pair like
Blackadder and El Dorado.
“Howitzer” : Our sporting padre stumbled
into the “school” while a hot argument was in
progress. The spin was for £2O, and the spinner
was accused of ringing in a “double-header.” Several
fights seemed inevitable, w'hen the sin-shifter inter-
vened with a proposal that the disputed wagers should
stand, the cloth to decide them by tossing two
pennies from his own pocket. The scholars all
agreed, and the hardest case in the battalion was
so overcome with emotion that he insisted on
wringing the parson’s hand. Up went the pennies
and down came heads; then the losers paid out,
satisfied that everything w T as “dinkum.” The sequel
came : when the padre was buying a paper from the
camp newsvendor. That worthy turned the proffered
copper over and handed it back. “No good to me,
mister,” he said, staring with morose suspicion at
the man who was dear to the Lord. “That brown’s
got two ’eads.”

In a great race over the Olympic distance
(1J miles) on the Port River the Murray Bridge
(S.A.) crew won the right to meet the pick of the
world’s eights at Argenteuil, on the Seine. The West-
ralians, stroked by their veteran welterweight, George
Rogers, put up a grand fight, but the heavier Cods
prevailed in the last 100 yards, and got hoftie by a
canvas, with Melbourne and the Old Launcestonians
close up. The time was 6min. 9 3-ssec. it will
cost about £3500 to send the Murray Bridget's, to-
gether with their trainer and coach, to France, and
the Olympic Council, though prepared to lavish £2lOO
on six swimmers, two of whom might as well be left
at home for all the chance they have of distinguishing
themselves in the Tourelles Stadium, has ruled that
the money for the oarsmen must be found in the State
winning the Test race. No doubt it will be dug up
somehow, but South Aus. has a legitimate grievance
against the Olympic people.
One of the few interesting matches in the
eight days’ tennis tournament on the Albert Ground,
Melbourne—there are too many of these tournaments
and they last too long—was provided by Miss Lance
and Mrs. Utz. They had previously combined to tear
the ladies’ doubles trophy from Mrs. O’Hara Wood and
Miss Boyd. Mrs. Utz, who won her way to the final
at Miss Boyd’s expense, is a graceful illustration of
the fact that it is not necessary to have
a bounteous physique to produce a match-winning
stroke. The little lady was conquered by
Miss Lance in two straight sets, but she
showed that she owns a low, swift shot off the. fore-
hand which is destined to reach championship rank.
In the other three events the energetic O’Hara Wood
was implicated, but didn’t always have the biggest
say. With his wife he won the mixed doubles comfort-
ably from Fitchett and Mrs. Utz, and, associated
with Patterson, he sent Wertheim and McTnnes back
to the pavilion in a little over an hour. The latter
pair, who had made the air smoke in previous en-
counters, dropped back to a sort of croquet technique
against the Davis Cuppers, and never once held a
commanding position. Wood v. Patterson, for the
championship singles, went to four sets and Patterson
took three of them, though he was only ahead by four
on the aggregate of games. Wood’s brightest patch
was the second set, where he bolted away from
Patterson and couldn’t be caught. If Wood could
have maintained the pace, the result would have
been closer. With a bit of luck, it might even
have been different.
“15-30”: I don’t think O’Hara Wood has beaten
Patterson since they met in Paris just after the war.
This may seem surprising, seeing that men inferior
to Wood in technique and eourtcraft —for example,
Schlesinger, Fitchett and Mclnnes —have walloped
the champion in recent years; but the explanation is
simple. Whereas Schlesinger and eo. have caught
Patterson when Jie was below par—-he was un-
doubtedly hampered by a sore ankle when Mclnnes
knocked him out recently—Wood has always had the
bad luck to encounter the big fellow in his finest
form. Last Saturday in Melbourne Patrick simply
slumped under a Big Bertha bombardment, and I
doubt if Anderson would have done much better.
Three times in succession Patterson shot untakable
balls into the forehand corner of Wood’s right court,
and he was almost as deadly down the centre line.
Wood hammered a fair proportion of service balls,
but he was plainly overwhelmed, and only postponed
his doom in the second set by some of the prettiest
ground play I have ever seen. Wood at his best is
delightful to watch,, and here was a flash—but only a
flash —of the man who did so well at Wimbledon and
in America in 1922. Given plenty of practice in
the U.S., he will probably be a different performer.
Patterson’s service has resumed its old ferocity. Were
his backhand as good he would be a match for
anyone breathing.
“Linesman”: I don’t know how many
countries have nominated for the Davis Cup this year,
but since some of the remote ones like Maoriland are
determined to enter for the European zone, Australia
will, at time of writing, only meet Japan or China, or
both, in America before entering the final round.
This arrangement is unfair to our fellows, because
it doesn’t give them the preliminary battles they need
for the bigger work later on. Should Japan with-
W. M. CATTLIN, assistant-secretary of
the Melb. Cricket Club.
draw, the Australians would be nursing their racquets
whilst awaiting the winner from the other side of
the Atlantic. The zone system is not a success. Its
weakness is manifest when a crowded entry on one
side of the herring pond gives the ultimate winner
ample opportunities to tune up, whilst scarcity of
opponents on the other side compels a team to rely
on the kindness of individual players for practice.
“S.T.”: Hyde Park managed to win the
Adelaide tennis premiership without its star, R. V.
Thomas. Thomas has always been delicate, and five-
set matches have tried him severely. With O’Hara
Wood, he won the doubles championship at Wimble-
don after the war ; and during a recent residence in
Sydney he found enough stamina to win the singles
championship of N.S.W. But now his chest has
gone back on him, and he is ordered to give up play
and live in the hills for at least six months.
“0.K.”: Where did “Elgar” (21/2/’24)
get his figures relative to the Elsternwick club’s
golf course at Cheltenham (Vic.)? In the first
place the land did not cost “close on £BO an acre.”
It cost under £4O an acre. Nor is the entrance
fee £lOO. Each member is required to take up
not less than £3O of debentures, but his entrance
fee is only 10 guineas, whilst the annual subscrip-
tion is seven guineas, instead of the £2O imagined
by “Elgar.” .Moreover, debentures bear interest at
6 p.c. p.a. “Elgar” speaks of himself as one who
thought of taking up golf, but now intends to “stick
to ping-pong.” Let him by all means stick to ping-
pong—but only in strict association with the truth.
Let him stick firstly to the truth, and then stick
to what he likes.
* * * *
George Eagel’s showing in the first moiety
of his bout with Tommy Uren, at Sydney Stadium,
suggested that he hadn’t forgotten the crack on the
chin presented to him by the same Thomas in their
previous argument. In succeeding rounds he took
more risks and once he had Tommy a bit rocky. But
the Australian soon recovered, and the tame affair
dawdled along to the only possible conclusion —
Uren, on points.
In Melbourne on Saturday Jerry Sullivan
was stopped in 10 rounds by Jock Niven, the Scotch-
born featherweight. Jerry is a plucky little fellow,
but, like Jacky Green, he was made to fight too
many 20-rounders when a growing boy. Now, when
he should be in his prime, he is a light of other days.
“Lexite” : Alan Fairfax came to light on
Saturday with a delightful 109 for St. George (N.S.W.)
—the only century of the day in first-grade matches.
When a schoolboy at lvogarah (he is only 17 now)
Fairfax scored century after century, encouraged
thereto by the headmaster, who, as a teacher at Crown-
street school, showed the infant Trumper how to wield
the willow. There is distinct promise in Fairfax,
and Mosman has a youngster with perhaps greatoi
possibilities in Withers. Though only 15, AVithers
has won a sure place in a pretty good XI, having
performed impressively, not only with the bat, but
with the ball and in the field.
With some assistance front J. Pluvius
N.S.W. overwhelmed Maoriland in the second Test at
AVellington. The visitors’ only knock yielded 294
(Bardsley 93, Punch 62; Mcßeth, 5 for 92), and
M.L. fell for 89 and 79, the ancient liortlang (39)
and Hiddlestone (23) shaping best. Hendry (8 for
33) did the damage in the first innings; Mailey
(5 for 20) and Everett (4 for 33) in the second.
One or two decisions were questioned by the crowd,
who signified their displeasure in the customary
fashion.
* * * *
“Wink”: The country-cricket week in
Melbourne has grown into a big thing. In 1922
Ballarat won from Hamilton and 30 other clubs.
Last season Ballarat again won, beating Kyabram.
This year, though there were more entrants tlian
ever, lack of turf wickets limited the competitors, as
in 1923, to 48 ; newcomers had to be content with
representation in other districts. Maryborough,
AA r oodfull’s old club, won, Kyabram again being
second. Maryborough’s best man was Stevens, a
veteran, who made two centuries and took B—-5,
5—22, 4 —19, 5—41. Kyabram again had to thank
D. Thompson and Whitbourne for their high position.
They were the best bowling pair, with Kohn and
Voges of Casterton, also old players, close behind.
Tognini, of Daylesford, took all 10 Mildura wickets,
including the hat trick, for 16 runs. Wilson, a
Benalla youngster, made 142, 75 and 87 n. 0., and
took 5—14, 4-—3 B, 2 —28, 4—65. City clubs are
already pursuing him. The champion bat was again
Pritchard, of Castlemaine. Last year his scores
were 52, 56, 107 retired, and 207 n. 0.; this time
he made 100, 108 n. 0., 54 n.o. and 44 n.o.
* * * *
“Tren”: In the early days of Australian
cricket throwing was common. Tommy Wills is
supposed to have introduced the practice; 60 years
ago or thereabouts cricket scribes were fond of
recording that “Wills got him at last with one of
his ‘peculiars.’ ” Dave Gregory had a questionable
delivery also. In the first innings of the famous match
at Redfern in 1871, Dave, Ned and Charlie Gregory
v. Wills, Conway and Cossticlc, the umpire, Nat
Thompson, penalised Dave’s first two deliveries. He
bowled no more that innings. In the second essay
his first ball was challenged, and then the second.
AVith the third he went through all the motions of
throwing and was again “called,” but he had art-
fully retained the ball in his hand, and refused to
continue unless a new umpire was chosen. After
argument, AV. Caffyn took Thompson’s place, and Dave
rocked ’em in with such effect that all three Vic-
torians fell before him. The Gregorys won the match
by 5 runs—24 and 30 to 21 and 28.
* * * *
The veteran of the S’ African team that
leaves for England in a month or two is Dave
Nourse, who lias been playing first-class cricket
years longer than any Australian top-notcher of
to-day. Nourse, who is 46, first appeared for Natal
in 1896. He played in England with the two previ-
ous S’African sides of 1907 and 1912, and in
Australia with the 1910-11 lot ; and he has the
distinction, probably unique in international cricket,
of having represented his country in 40 Test matches
without a break. He can hardly be the all-round
player he once was; yet only four years ago he
compiled his highest score in a Currie Cup match
(304 n. 0.), and last year he put up an innings of
186. Nourse is English-born.
“Centurion”; Rugby football has been
responsible for a further invasion of the French
tongue by English sporting terms. Horseracing be-
gan it, 70 years or so ago, and boxing followed.
Now the French Academy has ordained that such
words as “football,” “offside” and “scrum” may be
incorporated in the language, and that avant and
arriere may now be used as nouns when talking of
“forward” and “back.” No mention is made of
“barracker” or “put-in-the-boot,” but I expect later
advices.
* * * *
“Lond” : A sporting feature which always
strikes Australian visitors to England is the non-
observance of Christmas day by footballers. Australia
respects the dinner, if not the day ; but in England
on Dec. 25 there was a whole batch of important
Rugby fixtures. And the Soccer Leaguers had a full
programme for the holy day.
THE RULING PASSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘ln Surry Hills (Sydney) on Saturday, raids were
made on a couple of two-up schools. Some of the
men, who had been charged and bailed out after the
raid, were re-arrested in the second. ‘Even
while the defendants were in the yard of the Central
Police station, and while we were searching them,
there was a game of two-up in progress among them,’
declared the prosecuting sergeant in court.”
In the grey of a stifling morning, have you ever,
afloat or ashore,
Reached out for a hair of the Towzer that bit you
the night before?
Have you known a ruling passion—some lust that
gripped at the throat?
Have you fondled a snake to strike you or clung to
a hand that smote?
I reckon you have if you’re human, but pray that it
never may grip
Like the urge of the whirling pennies that spin aloft
from the kip.
There are men who might wilt and weaken, smitten
by anguish tense,
Pinched on a summer morning—twice for the same
offence.
But they breed ’em of tougher fibre, stiffer of souls
and wills,
In Ultimo, Glebe and Newtown, aye, and in Surry
Hills.
Hunted from post to pillar, harried from raid to
raid,
Heads high and unquenched in spirit to the bitter
end they played.
Though the hand of the Law was on them, though
in captive line they were set,
Take it from me (and the sergeant) the mob was
“heading ’em” yet.
When, ’front of the Throne of Judgment, they range
us, sinner and saint,
Whom can you see imposing on stalwarts like these
restraint ?
When the grim Recording Angel is droning arraign-
ments through
0{ the bad that we did so often and the good that we
failed to do,
In undertones I’ll expect it, from these dauntless ranks
amid,
A murmur of “Heads a deener!”—a mutter of
“Tails a quid!”

THE INKY WAY.
“Adamascus”: The old Western Champion, now
published iu Barealdine (W.Q.) but founded in
Bhiekall, recently returned to the town of its birth.
Its machinery breaking down, the formes were loaded
on cars and sent 75 miles to Blackall, where, after
a lapse of 35 years, the paper was printed again.
“Headline”: The Sunday-school teacher who subs
the stories for one of our boys’ papers has weird
ideas of how our nippers speak. The author of a
recent yarn had made one of his juvenile Australians
exclaim heatedly: “You silly blighters!” In print
it was; “You foolish nincompoops!”
Charles Fraser, for 17 years editor of the Otago
Witness (Dunedin), lias read his last proof, lie
had been at his desk up to the day before his death
Fraser first set foot on the Inky Way 55 years ago,
when he joined the Otago Daily Times. He became
sub-editor in ’B5, and went on to the Witness in ’O7.
Dale Collins, who wrote many good tales an!
much fair verse for The Bulletin, has followed up
his picturesquely worded “Seatracks of the Speejacks"
with a novel, “The Ordeal,” which is being published
simultaneously in London and Yew York. It is
claimed that Collins is the first Australian novelist
to achieve this. But of course that is wildly incor-
rect.
“R.N.8.”; Martin Luther Reading, after 10 years
in the editor’s swivel chair of Lyttelton Times
(M.L.), has turned in the job. In his advocacy of
the policy of domestic war-loans he had to battle
against the balance of the Maoriland press. Succeed-
ing Sam Saunders in 1914, Reading found his job
not exactly a bed of roses, but the little man with
the radical views and the loose-fitting clothes was
beloved of pressmen generally in the Shaky Isles.
R. W. lienderdine, a Federal Hansard man, has
been re-elected general president of' the Australian
Journalists’ Association for a second year. Trained
on British provincial journals he migrated to Mel-
bourne 10 years ago and became one of the test all
round men on the Age. Then Hansard, discovering
that he was a lightning Pitmanite, collared him,
just as, years ago, it snapped up Charlie George
(now retired) and Ernest Scott (now a Melbourne
Uni. prof.), two other “Pommies” who had had a
similar breaking-in.
“Simplon”: Charles George, a dapper little
veteran of Federal Hansard staff, has just retired
with a case of pipes and a travelling-rug as
souvenirs of affection from his colleagues. The mid-
get, who maintained the grace and urbanity of a
Chesterfield under the most exacting conditions, had
been wearying his ear with Federal speeches since
Australia became a Commonwealth. Originally he
was on the Westralian Hansard and had worked tor
various papers in Sydney and Melbourne. But he
cut liis journalistic teeth in Fleet-street, which he
left 35 years ago.
“0.P.H.”: The other day I met Alex. McKinley,
who used to own and run Melbourne Punch, and he
seemed to be as active as when he was the sileiu
member for Toorak in the Vic. Assembly of 1892-94.
He has outlived scores of his contemporaries who
said more and thought less. Parliament was no!
McKinley’s forte, and he left the House with no
regrets. Twice during his membership he arranged
to receive a deputation at Punch office from consti-
tuents who wanted him to either talk more or resign,
but his hecklers failed to appear. His hobby now is
the care of wayward lads.
“T.R.H.” : On his way to Sydney, Frank Massiug-
ham, son of the man who resigned £l5OO a year as
editor of London Daily News on conscientious grounds
at the time of the Boer War. Sir E. T. Cook resigned
from the Daily Chronicle at the same time and
for the same reason. Frank Massingham, who expects
to make a twelvemonth stay in Australia, is an old
Manchester Grammar Scliooi boy, and got a first in
“mods” at Oxford; but ill-health necessitated his
living in Italy, and he never took his degree. He i>
a well-known reviewer of books for the Nation and
Athen.eum and the Manchester Guardian, and an
occasional contributor to Blackwood’s and the
Fortnightly.
“H.S.”: Joynton Smith is one of the most care-
lessly-dressed litterateurs that ever composed a son-
net. I observed him in Macquarie-street recently m
side-spring Jemima boots, a pug’s guernsey, and one
of those absurd little hats that Germans call
“Alpines.” He was towing a degenerate-looking bull-
terrier by a piece of cord. It was in keeping wit.i
his role of friend of the down-trodden poor, ot
course. John Norton often got himself up similarly,
especially at election times. Yet gazing on Joynton
I couldn’t help thanking God that Fonthill Beckford,
London’s Leading Authority on Gent.’s Fashions,
wasn’t there to have his eyesight seared by the
spectacle of his employer.
“Henry Bateson”: The rarest M.L. paper is Te
Hokioi — i.e.j the War Bird—which was the Kingite
newspaper of the ’sixties. It consisted of four pages,
and was printed at Ngaruawahia, in the Waikato.
The printing-press came from Vienna, where it had
been presented to two Maori chieftains by Archduke
Maximilian. The Maoris had been taken round the
world by the geologist Hoclistetter, in the Novara,
and when in the Austrian capital were introduced to
the Emperor. As they were leaving they were asked
what they would like as a present, and their request
for a printing-press and type was granted. I be-
lieve the rusted remains of the press were lying
on the bank of the Waipa River a year ago. It was
to oppose the principles expounded by Te Hokioi
that the late Sir John Gorst founded Te Pihoihoi
Mokemoke i te Tcanui— “The Lonely' Lark on the
Housetop.”
“Cyrano”: The death of John Morley has cleared
up a literary mystery. Perhaps no critical onslaught
of Victorian times "had effects so wide and lasting
as the Saturday Review's notice of Swinburnes
first series of “Poems and Ballads.” “Lurid horrors,
said the Saturday, which was then at the height oi
its power. But this was mild compared
flagellation of the' poet’s morals. He was called "an
unclean fiery imp from the pit,” and “the libidinous
laureate of ‘a''pack' of shtyrs.” Swinburne’s publisher,
becoming panic-stricken, refused to issue the edition,
and the author and his friends had to take it over.
Edmund Gosse, Swinburne’s biographer, now reveals
that Morley was the executioner. He told Gosse that
he regretted what he . had done, and bade him keep
the secret during his (Morley’s) lifetime. A pom,
of interest in the affair is the fresh revelation ot
Morley. the agnostic as a Puritan.
“Pedro”: Henry Lucy, who died in England the
other da.y, and David Christie Murray, who died yeai=
ago, were journalistic associates in their youth and
bitter enemies thereafter. Upon their friendship was
built the best of all English newspaper novels, which
made them enemies. Murray was its author, Lucy
its butt-. Lucy first wrote “Gideon Fleyll,” in which
he mildly caricatured Murray as J. Bailv Brown, a
bohemian journalist.. Murray resented it, and wrote
“The Way of the Wprld,” featuring Lucy as William
Amelia, an intriguing, incapable, scandal-collecting
toady. .It described’ithis bounder’s journalistic genesis
and uprise with' yeitomous particularity and out ot
a wideband deep-knowledge of life on both London
and provincial newspapers. ■ Lucy raged when t *
storv Appeared, and would have taken legal action
against " Murray, but was dissuaded by his men®.
Aside "from its personal aspect, ‘ The Way of the
World” is a delightfully- intimate novel of journalism
and journalists.
THE MARCH OF JOURNALISM.

The very attractive rate of interest
offered (6% free of State Income
Tax) provides you with an invest-
ment that will take a lot of beating.
The cash will be waiting for you on
May 31 st if you want it, but the
Treasury’s conversion proposition is
well worth your consideration.

Many of you cashed these bonds
at the time at considerable inconve-
nience to yourselves. To all of you
who helped the Diggers in this way,
the Commonwealth Government
confidently appeals to convert your
holdings into the New Loan.
Ihe Government on their part
are offering- an interest rate (6%
free of State Income Tax) which
should help you to come to a quick
decision to help them in connection
with their Loan Conversion opera-
tions.

TO ALL MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN WHO HAVE A
LITTLE CASH TO SPARE.
Honestly, can you imagine any
safer investment than a Common-
wealth Bond? It is the one security
that transcends all others. The in-
terest is paid every half-year just as
surely as the sun rises and sets.
Just think! You are offered 6%,
free of State Income Tax, and you
have the choice of taking up 3-year
bonds, 5-year bonds, or 10-year
bonds—whichever you like.

TO PARENTS
WHO WOULD LIKE TO PUT
ASIDE A NEST-EGG FOR
THEIR CHILDREN.
Here is a golden opportunity—
one that might never come again.
By taking up a ten-year £ 1 0 bond
and letting the interest accumulate,
it would be worth £l7/1/9 on
maturity. If ten years is too long,
try either a five-year or a three-year
bond. The 5-year bond would grow
into £l3/4/11, and the 3-year bond
into £ll/17/8.
This is absolutely the best thing
you could possibly do for your

Irene Vanbrugh's reputation as an imper-
sonator of Pinero characters was made in
"Trelawney of the Wells” and “The Gay
Lord Quex.” Not long after her visit to
Australia with J. L. Toole she appeared as
Ellean in George Alexander’s production of
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” the Paula
being Evelyn Millard. Now, 30 years after,
she is herself playing Paula in a brilliant
revival of the drama that her husband, Dion
Boucicault, introduced to us. Miss Vanbrugh’s
Paula is not exactly the Paula that Pinero
drew. In her first scene with the chivalrous
Aubrey, who is about to make an improper
dame “respectable,” her manner seems un-
necessarily cold, her voice a trifle hard. But
as the plot develops she puts everything she
has into the part. Boredom, wounded pride,
unsatisfied affection, jealousy, explosive rage,
fear and despair are so presented as to make
the audience feel that they are not simu-
lated emotions, but the real thing. In
moments of anguish Paula trembles and
totters, and genuine teai-s course down her
cheeks. Finer acting has seldom been seen in
Sydney, though at least half a dozen young
women who are not in the same class' as
Miss Vanbrugh have, in times quite recent,
been effusively labelled “great.” The'Ellean
of Janet Eccles is winsome in a wistful
way; and C. M. Hallai’d makes Aubrey a
dignified and appealing figure, though
older in appearance than the dramatist’s
man of forty, who is “either a stoic or a
satyr.” And Boucicault is always in the
picture as Cayley Drummle, the kindly man of
the world. Useful work is also done by Lena
Ilalliday, Joan Crossley and Pirie Bush.
“Tons of Money,” at Sydney Grand Opera
House, continues as rich and alluring as it
sounds, and as whimsical and captivating as
fine acting and dressing can make it. The
ballets alone are things to streak the drab-
best outlook with silver.

Sydney Tivoli claims Cecil Bradley's last
couple of weeks in Australia —she is off on a
London engagement, and her soprano is at
its best in "Cigarette'’ and other of her musi-
cal-comedy successes. Levinsky's car still
attracts a host of sympathisers, but that’s
about all it does bring him except unwelcome
relations and repair bills; Fireman Bob Wil-
ton’s organisation has not improved much,
and local insurance rates are soaring; Carl-

Kelleway and Co. are as refreshing as ever.

The Playbox Society, with Duncan Mac-
dougall and his wife at its head, has a studio-
theatre and rehearsal rooms in Rowe-street,
Sydney, where Sabbath evenings will be en-
lightened w r ith readings and lectures. Next
Sunday will see the beginning, when Wede-
kind’s “Awakening of Spring” will be read
by Mr. Macdougall. One of Judge Beeby’s
plays is being rehearsed, and will be pro-
duced in Easter Week.
Sydney Lyceum has re-opened with “Lost
and Found,” a South Sea love-tale. The
supporting feature, “A Front-Page Story,”
shows how a cub on a Yankee country paper
took advantage of a quarrel between his
editor and the local mayor to make a name
for himself. “The White Rose” still occu-
pies the Crystal Palace, but “Nero” is booked
to take its place within a couple of weeks.
“A Lady of Quality,” at Hoyt’s, is a review
of the life and “affairs” of an eighteenth-
century girl. On the same programme is
“The Scarlet Lily”—another harrowihg tale
of a poor girl, a rich villain and a struggling
young lover. Of course her in-no-cence is
proved in the end and the villain is ker-
ruslied. At the Globe “The Silent Partner”
is well acted Stock Exchange fiction. “Mile-
a-Miuute Romeo,” Tom Mix’s latest, is on
view at the Strand—the usual trick-riding
picture made sticky with love-molasses. The
other picture, “The Rover,” shows how hard
Fate can make a man’s life when she likes
to be nasty.
A consideration which might have deterred
Oscar Asche from producing Pinero’s “Iris”
was the fact that the plot of the play had
been already familiarised to the public here.
The story told at Melb. King’s sounds like
an echo of “The Easiest Way,”' wherein
Muriel Starr, Frank Harvey and four other
people gave a brisker, crisper entertainment
on the lines now followed in “Iris.” As to
which of them was earliest in the field—well,
Oscar Asche made his first London success
as Maldonada in “Iris,” whereas the new
American play was first produced in New
York only 15 years ago. The American
play is really, however, a rough, meaty
improvement on Pinero’s drama. The half-
dozen characters in it include a glaring dcmi-
mondaine who tickled the Melbourne amphi-
theatre to death, whereas some of the minor
figures in “Iris” nearly bored the amphi-
theatre stiff last Saturday night. Why stage
the rather old-fashioned moral drama even
for a week?
* * * #
While Miss Diana Wilson has physical
qualifications for the name-part, it asks too
much of her as an actress. She is seldom, if
ever, quite convincing. She has no great
moments. She never gets lost in her im-
personation. The heroine is always Diana
Wilson, an actress whose manner is theatri-
cal, whose gait too frequently is slithersome,
and whose hurried utterances do injustice
to the author. The lady commands atten-
tion by her magnetic presence, yet her per-
formance is not gripping. Nevertheless, the
leading lady is much stronger than Anew
McMaster, as the beauteous young man who
righteously rejects her at the finish. That
Oscar Asche was an impressive Maldonada
when young and shapely goes without say-
ing. He is always powerful now that he
has to contend with cruel obesity and the
brainless irreverence it excites. But Asche
cannot make the play, in its present casting,
worth the careful staging it receives, though
the show, to be sure, is fully worth the
modest amount of wreckage that Maldonada
achieves when his outraged feelings as a
millionaire and a profligate run amok, and
the curtain is about to fall. Among the
supporting company nobody stands out save
Greenaway for his clear-spoken suggestion of
a fleeting, fashionable solicitor who bolts with
everybody’s trust moneys. On Saturday
comes “Tamihg of the Shrew” for the last
nights of the Asche season.
The Cabaret Girl,” now of Melbourne
Majesty s, is the usual spectacular froth of
musical fun and dance, effervescing from the
frailest of plots. The company, never a very
strong one, has put on some pounds of artis-
tic weight since it was last in Melbourne, but
it still calls loudly for vocal strength on the
feminine side. Madge Elliott trills as sweetly
as a canary bird, and almost as wordlessly.
She should take a lesson in the value of clear
diction from little .Josie Melville, who always
lets you know what she is singing about. But
Madge has lost her former angularity of
style, and acts and dances with a lissom
grace which almost blinds one to her exces-
sive length of limb. Her devoted stage-lover,
Harold Pearce, a new-comer, is a good-look-
ing young man of the Paul Plunkett order,
who moves briskly and sings pleasingly,
although his voice never melts to loverlike
tenderness. Alfred Frith, as funnyman-iu-
chief, gets plenty of rough material to work
on. His London trip has furbished up his
comedy sense and cured him of the habit of
making faces for grimaces’ sake. In turn a
music seller, a bogus cleric and a lady vamp,
he feeds his audience with a continuous out-

put of comedy tricks, without badly over-
working: his countenance. Frith vamps as a
dreadful female person in a black wig and
red velvet gown, while strictly abstaining
from panto, dameishuess. The many-sided
Cyril Ritchard, who has replaced his former
stiff method with an easy style, tackles a
fat _ all-round part with commendable skill.
Floie Allen shows a nice taste for character
work as a musical-comedy edition of Audrey
in “As You Like It.” Lady Patricia Black-
wood, who created an electrical disturbance
when she walked on, a show girl with a few
lines to say, spoke these quite audibly, look-
ing very pretty, pardonably nervous and beau-
tifully frocked. -She has quite the right stage
appearance for an aspirant of sound social
pretensions. Old friend Susie Vaughan; as a
Marchioness with little to do, got no chance
of showing her form. For the rest, the usual
bunch of beauties twinkled nimble legs in
several pleasing ballets, while Rita Nugent
and Jack Hooker contributed an eccentric
dance-turn, in which the little woman looked
more like an india-rubber edition of a human
than ever.

The process of civilising a rough but
simple millionaire is repeated with a dash of
French vivacity in “Bluebeard’s Eighth
Wife,” at Melbourne Royal. The affluent
John Brown, whose ignorance of women has
been deepened by several trips to the altar,
tries a fresh wife in the shape of Monna,
only to learn that she represents the con-
centrated sapience and craft of the previous
seven, and has a talent for provocative utter-
ance which is all her own. His “Bought
and Paid For” methods are therefore doomed
to fail, and he is reduced by a familiar
stratagem to metaphorically eating grape-
nuts out of her hand. Her pretence of a
midnight assignation with a young twig of
the nobility is her joker in the game of euchre.
The scene is bedroomy to the verge of em-
barrassment. In this tableau, which was
probably more engaging in Paris, one dis-
covers that the difference between delicacy
and indelicacy is Gertrude Elliott. She has
the caressing note of superior propriety, and
suggests a dear type which, in later life,
will take inevitably to mittens. Herbert
Millard, as the stage father, introduces some
of the roast beef of old England into what
might otherwise become a purely Gallic im-
personation. The task of escaping the
seventh heaven of matrimony to embrace
the eighth wonder of the world falls on
Mayne Linton, who at first sounds like a
meeting of the New York Police Union, but
after a while makes some virtue of his
brusqueness and frequently drops into a
manageable tone of voice. On the other
hand, an ear-trumpet may be necessary to
appreciate some of the pianissimos of Wil-
liam Mollison, who damages a good study by
gagging and “business.” He could be just
as funny without anticipating the theatre’s
forthcoming change into a vaudeville house.
Lilias Waldegrave is sentenced to light labor
in the part of Miss George, and she is bright
enough to earn a reprieve. Athol Forde, a
m&itre d’hotel with the aspect of a church
elder, and T. M. Oliff, a private detective
who is neither private nor a detective, are
the most important among the rest.
At Melbourne Palace “The Man in Dress
Clothes” continues to be chastened by hav-
ing to seek rest for his temporary impecuni-
osity in a housemaid's bed, no housemaid be-
ing in residence at the time. Melbourne has
decided in favor of Seymour Hicks and his
fresh French play. Beryl Bryant came to
the relief of Mrs. Hicks at last Wednesday's
matinee, and the young Australian actress,
being admirably suited to the part of
Lticieivs opportune spouse, it is understood
that she will rrtatinee some more;
Priscilla Dean gladdens the heart of the
multitude in “Drifting,” at Hoyt’s, Mel-
bourne, this week. A great demand is made
bn Priscilla’s repertoire of heroic attitudes
by the necessity of having to risk death for
the man she loves. There is a great flow of
pathos and sentiment in the supporting fic-
tion, “Old Dad,” but nothing is too sloppy
for a Melbourne movie audience. “How We
Failed to Beat the Favorite” should be the
title of the crooks’ lament in “Little Johnny
Jones” at the Majestic. Revolutions almost
telescope one another in the Central Ameri-
can romance, “You Never Know,” at the
sanie house; but Earle Williams and Ger-
trude Astor brush aside all these cheerless
interruptions to their passion. Betty Comp-
son in “Woman to Woman,” at the Melba,
is a gaudier exponent of French emotion
than Gertrude Elliott was in the spoken
drama. Francis X. Bushman, in “Modern
Marriage,” at the Britannia, is hiring the
suckers from the rag sales on the other side
of the street.

The other sort of picture show i
Your modern pictorial photographer can afford to
smile at the old, supercilious dictum that there tail
be no art in photography, it being a merely
mechanical process. That held good only so long
as photography was merely mechanical, but it was
knocked flat as soon as it was realised that the
camera could be made to give an impression rather
than a starkly detailed reproduction of a subject,
and that the widest personal control could be exer-
cised as to color, composition, tone and texture in
a dozen methods of producing the final print. Some
idea of what that personal factor has done to lift
the thing on to the plane of Art may be gleaned at
the exhibition of “camera pictures” which Monte
Luke is , holding at his studio in the Strand. There are
about four dozen prints, including a few that have
earned him distinction at the London, Canadian and

near its pinnacle. The' little show is commanding
a good deal of interest, and red tabs began to appear
almost as soon as Minister for Education Bruntnell
opened- it- on Monday.

“Moko”: Docs Nellie Stewart mention in
lier book her experiences with Arthur
Roberts when she played in “Blue-eyed
Susan” in London? He was then at the
top of his popularity, and could do anything
with managements and audiences. For the
first time for many years Nellie Stewart had
to play second fiddle, and Roberts was in no
way delicate about putting her in her place.
One night she happened to be standing full
in the spotlight. “Excuse me,” said Cap-
tain Crosstrees Roberts, and beckoned her
to one side. “That light is for me,” he
explained, and stepping into it struck an
attitude and grinned at the grinning audi-
ence. On the night of the university boat-
race George Musgrove had a gag about the
result compounded for Nellie, who was on
the stage before Roberts, and duly got her
laugh. Roberts was furious, and Musgrove
was carpeted, as he had so often carpeted
others, and was warned that a penalty with
boiling oil in it would follow any further
infringement of the rights of King Arthur.
WITH HER TO HELP HIM.
MISS WHITE: “I don’t believe there is a
thing in the world that George wouldn’t
dare to do with me to help him.”
MISS BLACK: “Yes, he even proposed to
you, didn’t he, dear?”
“0.P.H.” : The shade of Richard Brinsley
Sheridan must surely have been lurking near
when his descendant, Patty Blackwood,
signed a contract to appear in “The Cabaret
Girl.” The former owner (under difficul-
ties) of Drury-lanc was grandfather of the
Helen Selina Sheridan who married the
Baron Dufferin. Their son was the notable
first Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, and the
stage-struck Patricia is the second Marquis’s
youngest daughter. If she succeeds on the
boards she might be seen in one of her an-
cestor’s comedies —say as Lydia Languish in
“The Rivals” or as Lady Teazle in “The
School for Scandal.”
“T.It.H.” : There is nothing in the acting
of Ellaline Terriss that recalls her ill-fated
father, the hero of dozens of Adelphi melo-
dramas. Terriss used to walk about the
Strand wearing, among other things, a long
black, flapping cloak and a huge, black,
broad-brimmed hat. He was always acting.
It was “poses, poses all the way” with Wil-
liam. Even his death was melodramatic.
He had produced his umpteenth successful
melodrama when a crazy fellow named
Lewin, who had conceived the notion that
Terriss had stolen his (Lewin’s) plot,
waited at the stage-door in Marden-lane, and
stabbed him in the back with a stiletto.
Terriss made his final exit at the Charing
Cross Hospital, a hundred yards away.
“Mid-Channel": Much has been written
about Asche’s “Othello,” but not a word about
his distortion of the final curtain in “Iris.”
Yet the spectacle of a massive Maldonado
smashing a few pieces of crockery and a
spindly chair or two and then precipitating
himself to the floor in a violent fit was just
short of ludicrous. Pinero’s direction for
this particular action is as follows
He overturns the table with a savage kick, then,
raising a chair high in the air, dashes it to the
ground, smashing it to splinters. The curtain falls
finally.
In a letter to myself, the author says: “I
am much amused by what you tell me about
Maldonado’s fit. When the cat’s away the
mice will play, and when the author is in
England and the actor is in Australia —I
leave you to finish the sentence.” How
about Maldonado finishing it himself?
“Banshee”: Henry Russell, art director
of the Opera Co., has been at some pains to
explode an English allegation that “there
are great operatic stars who can’t read music
for nuts.” Russell declares that this might
have been true in days gone by, but that no
“modern singer” of any class is so ignorant
as that. Well, Caruso may be dead, but he
is recent enough to be modern, and tin l
authorised storv of his life declares that to
the day of his death he read music with
difficulty. It was Enrico’s custom to write
out his part in a script of his own artless
invention. This he studied assiduously,
carefully breaking up the words into syl-
lables to fit the rough notes on his impro-
vised score; and after a couple of days at
home he was ready to rehearse with the
orchestra. lie was only in the “Nellie Ely”
class on the piano.
“Podsnap”: Australian Fred Collier is
getting on in London. Critics record his
success as Betto in the first English produc-
tion of Puccini’s “Gianni Schicchi,” a rather
jolly little effort in which the Australian has
to convert his elegant Roman nose into the
effulgent organ of a heavy drinker. Col-
lier is unrecognisable in his make-up. So
is Browning Mummery, who lifts up his
voice in the. same piece. The pronuncia-
tion of “Gianni Schicchi” seems to be
troubling the Londoners, by the way.
“Zhan-ee Skee-kee” is as near as I can get
to it after “wording” a fruit-vendor.
“Abbot Park”: In tackling the part of
Brunnhilde (B. 6/3/24). Melba found that
the character involved putting forth more
effort than her lyric soprano could comfort-
ably manage. Opera-goers of the ’nineties liked
her Elsa and also her Elizabeth in “Tann-
liauser,” where the pure quality of tone was
in keeping with the heroine’s music.
Another powerful part essayed by Melba was
Aida, but. generally she has remained true
to the lyric roles —Lucia, Ophelia in “Ham-
Man on, Isedda in Micacla
in “Carmen,” the Queen in “The Hugue-
nots, . Lakme, Juliet, Marguerite in
I aust,’ Helene, Mimi in “La Boheme, ’
\ ioletta in “La Traviata,” Gilda in
"Rigoletto,” Rosina in “The Barber of
Seville,” Desdemona in “Otello,” Semiramidc,
Esmeralda, the Infanta in “La Cid,” and
Elaine in Bembcrg’s opera of the same
name—it was written for her. Of this list
only half a dozen have been heard by music-
lovers in Australia.
, *,F' - L.H.”: To the list of Stradivarius
fiddles in Maoriland (B. G/3/’24) add the
fine instrument belonging to J. C. Cameron,
of Hawera. Cameron is a violin-maker and
restorer, and several precious instruments
have gone through his hands. He gave
Henri Verbrugghen the opportunity of trials
on the Strad. during his M.L. tour. “It
lias only one fault,” said the little Belgian,
sadly, ‘it isn’t mine.”
“Second Murderer”: “Trevdee” (B.
6/3/’24) asks why chorus gents, always look
so glum on the stage. It’s because they have
to be glum. As Buttercup sings in “Pina-
fore”
I know the value of a kindly chorus;
But choruses yield little consolation
Whrn we have pain and trouble too before us.
Take the male chorus of any G. and S.
opera. In “Pirates of Penzance” they are
serious-minded freebooters or solemn police-
men. In “Mikado” they are aristocratic
courtiers who never smile. In “lolanthe”
they are particularly stolid and dignified
peers. In “Patience” they are heavy—very
heavy—dragoons. Certainly the jurymen in
Trial by Jury” warble:—
He shall treat us with awe,
If there isn’t a flaw,
Singing so merrily, trial-la-law.
But the point of the joke is that they are
all as solemn as bookmakers in church. Tak-
ing one consideration with another, the
chorus life is not a happy one.
“R. 8.”: Frank Nankivell, long established
in New York, has “put over” his colored
picture films —movie stories with marionette
figures that look like life and act more
naturally. He is scenario-director, art-
director, and all the cast (per proxy of his
staff), and his new departure in movie art
is showing in Philadelphia, Chicago and the
West. Australasian Films has bought five
copies of each for Australia, and the plucky
Australian artist is on the pig’s back.
‘‘Norbell”; I agree with “Cmsar’s Ghost”
(±3. u/o/ 24) that supers are hard to train.
They will only recognise the established
cues of the drammer. Thus they must hear
Hark! What mean those shouts?” three
Wx GS before they’ll utter a perfunctory
Hooray! off. Asche used gramophones
tor his rabble off” when he was Count
Hannibal here years ago, and they proved
most conscientious supers. Rignold was
the daddy of all producers at handling
stupors. But he could instruct anything or
anybody in stage business, from the white
horse in “Henry V.” to the bass drum. He
had been a fiddler in an orchestra, himself in
Jus salad days, and knew what he wanted.
Once, on tour, a Westralian orchestra de-
clined to endure a long-drawn-out rehearsal,
and got up to leave before the last act
Aery well, gentlemen,” said the Big Chief :
but remember this to-night. When in
doubt, play a blanky plaintive.”
“Billy Cann” : For years our vegetable John
iias had no comment to offer upon anythin"
except the quality of his wares; but the
hopeful from next door made him break his
silence at last. Armed with a new spring-
gun and a noeket-
ful of corks, the
lad sailed down the
s t reet until he
sighted John’s cart,
the horse’s head
buried in the nose-
bag. Taking care-
ful aim, he plugged
the venerable nag
on the ear. With
a _ snort and a
quiver, the victim
was off at a gallop,
scattering beans
and carrots all over
the landscape. Hap-
pening along as
John was estimat-
ing the damage, I
offered sympathy.
It was then he re-
laxed to the extent
of seven words,
packed with bitter-
ness: “Boy lookem too much dam’ Melican
picker.”
“Gnarek”: Among the horrors of the late
war were the amateur concert parties which
attacked convalescents at the base camps.
At Le Havre one evening a massive owner
of a C 3 voice and an over-nourished female
were regaling a multitude of Diggers with
“The Keys of Heaven.” Verse after verse
of the dreary old bleat was listened to with
philosophic resignation until the lady
accepted the gent’s offer of the key's
of his heart. The inharmonious surrender
was interrupted by a roar of “Thank Gawd
’e’s clicked.”
“P.E.S.”: I studied for a while with
.Tames Hay (B. 7/2/’24), and encouraged
him to take his tenor abroad. Jimmy’s
teachers were Carl von Hartmann, Lardelli
and J. B. Huntingdon, all of Perth; and
Marshall Hall, Amy Sherwin, Bouhy and
Jean de Reske. Some of them can’t deny
it, being dead.
“3/912”: We were playing stock drama
through the Thames-Waihi (M.L.) gold-
fields, when our advance agent fell ill. A
substitute was found in a bright young
Maorilander, who told us he knew all about
boosting a show. He was instructed in the
use of the code-book and warned to include
the word “ostrich” in liis wire if he thought
it advisable to skip certain towns. “Ri-
chew-are,” he replied cheerfully; so we
packed his printing-box, gave him a few
pounds and wished him luck. A few days
afterwards the old man’s grey hair nearly
turned pink when he received a collect mes-
sage like this: “Advise not play Taihape.
Bad weather here. Three hypnotic shows
closed down and sword-swallower rouso-
abouting for publican. Mexican Gypsies
stranded. No money in the town. Pros-
pects not too ostrich.”
“Lond.”: W. S. Percy is playing the
wicked uncle in “Aladdin,” at the Wood-
Green Empire, probably London’s biggest
panto, now that Drury-lane doesn’t have
one. It must be due to his Australian in-
fluence that Aladdin’s dog surprises London
by being named Bonzer.
“Sucre”: “Hamer” (B. 6/3/’24) makes
a mistake when he says Henry James Wil-
liams wrote “It’s a Long Way to Tip-
perary.” Its author and composer was
Jack Judge, an Irishman, who sang it in
many of the music-halls on his native
heath long before it reached England.
Publishers galore turned it down, until it
fell into the mail-box of B. Feldman, a
Londoner.
“Antipholus”: I first saw A. E. Green-
away’s Cassio (B. 28/2/’24) at Melb. Opera
House in 1889. The cast included Geo.
Miln as Othello, Nat Douglas as lago.
Louisa Jordan as Desdemona and Kate
Douglas as Emilia. Miln was a great elocu-
tionist. I remember the Age advising mem-
bers of the Vic. Parliament to see his Hamlet
and learn how to speak their mother-
tongue. “Hamlet” ran for six weeks.
Greenaway was a fine Horatio, and I still
remember his Duke of Buckingham in
“Richard the Third.” Jimmy Cathcart ap
peared with this co., and Dampier played
Othello and lago alternately with Miln.
Some of the productions were “Antony ami
Cleopatra,” “The Merchant of Venice,"
“Ingomar,” “Richelieu” and “The Fool’s
Revenge.”
From The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant:
In the early ’sixties the leading members of the
Lyster Opera Co. arrived from ’Frisco and opened
at the old Royal, Melbourne. At the conclusion of
the season they moved on to Adelaide with Farqu-
harson, a basso. Meanwhile the Melbourne papers
reprinted a letter W'hich Henry Squires, the tenor, had
sent to the ’Frisco Cali,, and in which he complained
that the people of Australia were “nearly all blawsted
English.” When the co. reappeared in Melbourne,
(“Martha” was the opera) the packed house rose at
GEE! AN ARTIST'S NIGHTMARE AFTER SEEING THE
MELBOURNE PRODUCTION OF “SALLY.”
him. There was applause in the dress-circle, but
stalls (I was there), pit, gallery and family-circle
hissed and hooted. Squires attempted to speak, but
it was no use. Then Farquharson, a great favorite,
came on and stood beside the victim with a hand
on the .latter’s shoulder; but the crowd refused to
be pacified. Suddenly the basso bent over the foot-
lights and whispered to the conductor. The band
struck up “The Last Rose of Summer” and Squires's
voice was heard above the din. He never sang better.
tV hen he had finished half the audience was still
hostile, but the other half was applauding like mad.
When the co. sang in Sydney there was another
angry demonstration against Squires. On this occa-
sion, however, his wife, Madame Escott, chanced to
be on the stage when he made his entrance, and the
audience, a few rowdies excepted, was touched into
silence by her mute appeal on behalf of her lord.
“Te Pana” : If Maoriland works have no-
thing else to recommend them, the titling is
apt. _ Alf Hill’s “Tanpo,” Ribbands and
Don’s “Marama” and “Land of the Moa” are
cases in point. Long after the themes are
forgotten the names are still a lingering
memory. Bert Royle—he has lived in M.L.
long enough to qualify as a native —wrote
“Djin-Djin,” which had a good run with
Tom Pollard’s show in the palmy days of
that co. But “D.-D.” isn’t Maori —it's
Chinese.
“J.H.” (London) : “Havoc,” which has
just been put on at the Haymarket, is oddly
enough the first serious play about the war
that London has seen. There have, of
course, been war burlesques and war revues
in plenty. Wall, a Yorkshire solicitor, did
his bit at the cost of his practice, and took
to play-writing in order to keep things going
while the practice was re-building. The
critics hesitate to call “Havoc” great, but
they are agreed that it is a winner.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: A Sydney actor, called
upon to play George Peyton, in “The Octo-
roon,” at a day’s notice, fixed his study in
a quaint fashion. The part is a difficult one.
being a mass of broken speeches, witli very
few straight-ahead scenes ; the man cast for
it has to be an adept at picking up cues.
This George Peyton wrote out his lines on
scraps of paper, which he fastened to pieces
of scenery, so that while waiting for his
entrances he could look up what he had to say.
Unfortunately, a sozzled mechanist compli-
cated matters by tangling the scenery. The
result was that George spent a night of agony
looking for his notes. There was another
actor new to his part who had a lengthy
speech written on the shirt front of the
father upon whose bosom he had to weep
his penitence. The old man of the show
was indignant at the outrage to his linen,
but was consoled by a promise that his
laundry bill would be paid.
THE NEAR ARTIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The thrush, sweet-throated, sings his love
Till list’ners are to rapture wrought;
But conscious of the trills above
The envious eat is lost in thought:
What’s ecstasy without a voice?
His love’s as glorious and as great;
The pity is, when he’d rejoice,
His medium’s so unfortunate.
He knows, by harsh experience taught,
What recompense his efforts bring;
Not all the birds he ever caught
Can teach his passion how to sing.

account of this belief, as well as from the fact that the famous Blend of

At the Christening of the first-born, the coming
of age, and the wedding; at the launching of
ships, at public functions when the very best is a
matter of course there you will find Lindeman s
Champagne invariably chosen —a wine worthy
of correct serving.
It should be cold, but not too cold. Never warm, for warm
champagne is unpalatable to the cultured taste. At 50 degrees
Fahrenheit you will find it superb.
To observe correct style, fine crystal glasses should be used of
tulip shape and hollow stems —never in the shallow, wide-
rimmed kind so commonly used.
Drink this fine wine under these conditions and you will
appreciate that exquisite quality which has made Linde-
man’s Champagne the choice of connoisseurs.

Works Behind It
THE finished Paige 6-70 represents
not only the skill of Paige Engi-
neers ; it is the culmination of their
ideals coupled with the experience
of years in building fine motor
cars.
However, there is something else
which goes into these beautiful
motor cars the human element
behind work well done the care
and precision exercised by each in-
dividual workman—the incessant
watchfulness the road tests and
trials given each particular Paige so
that no part of the finished motor
car in the hands of the driver will
be found wanting. The smallest part
must be perfect.
The driving of a Paige 6-70 with its
powerful engine and beautiful body
lines imparts an air of distinction
to the owner.

MISS ELSIE PARKES,
the Beautiful Australian Actress and
Dancer appearing with the “Tons
of Money Co., at the Opera House.
A Dainty Advocate of Mercolized
Wax for the Skin.
FOR A
BEAUTIFUL SKIN
Wash your face in warm water,
and while the skin is still damp
lightly smear a little pure mercolized
wax over your face and neck, and
leave on until the morning. After a
few nights of this treatment the
blemishes on your skin should dis-
appear.
Mercolized wax dissolves away
the old, dry skin and leaves behind
a new, healthy complexion. Beauty
is but skin deep—mercolized wax
brings it to the surface. It is empha-
sised that this wax is quite harmless,
and contains only the purest ingre-
dients, being free from any poison-
ous mercury salts.
The meaning of the word “mer-
colized is active,” and its activity
is obtained from its oxygen content,
which is Nature’s own beautifier. As
a general facial cleanser mercolized
wax is unequalled, being in universal
everyday use by up-to-date, dis-
criminating women. Husbands also
find it beneficial for use after shav-
ing, especially if the skin is chafed.
It should always be used before the
application of powder, as the wax
will prevent the pores of the skin
from becoming clogged and un-
healthy.
All Chemists can supply you with
pure mercolized wax, in neat,
original tins, containing sufficient to
last from six to eight weeks. Price,
5/6 per tin, or post free from

A motor-car, a “copper"
Big man, real whopper,
Calls car to stop,
Else driver will drop:
Car driver doesn’t heed,
Goes on full speed
Right down crowded street
Past many flying feet.
A motor-car, a rock,
Big one, huge block,
Car bashes right in.
Driver has rough spin;
Comes to full stop.
Falls off in one pop,
Worse than old moke,
Arms, legs, all broke.
Next day, sad" to say,
There’s deuce to pay;
Car driver much worse,
So says hired nurse;
His face all violet,
Sends for sky pilot.
A funeral—sad tale ;
Motor-car “for sale.”

A weak parody.... Mombak: Leap-year is justified if
only because without it we couldn’t have got this:—
Rupert, I lore you, I’ve loved you for years,
1 f you refuse I’ll drown in my tears:
Marry me, dearest, I’ll be a good wife,
I've got a few pounds, you’re set up for life.
Three years I’ve waited for this joyous day
To open my heart, to sec what you’d say ;
All last night I fasted and prayed,
And now I’m sure for you I’m made.
Answer me quickly, you’re killing me waiting,
Catch me, quick, Rupert, I feel I am fainting:
I’ve pricked off the days to the twenty-nine—
If you refuse me, to the grave T will pine.
O Mary! go chary, I can’t speak for joy,
My happiness now holds no alloy;
I thought of you, dreamt of you, for years.
And now' I can hardly believe my ears.
Dearest, I’ll have you, though your eyes look bleared,
And I’m sure you’ve drunk oceans in fifty years ;
But still I am thinking w'hat I’ve missedj
And he joyously embraced, and solemnly kissed.
. ...L.F.K.: Regret, space isn’t available Biggins:
Thanks, but we don’t like the smell of it... .. Ricardo:
Obliged, but it w'as reviewed some months. ag0....
Hambone: Don’t like the par that shakes its head and
says it could tell a lot of dreadful things if it
liked. In this case not to mention the State would
be unfair to the police in every other State..
W. : Elementary... .Marie B. P.: Don’t seem to
have received a copy of it... . Truthful James: That
critic wasn’t “in a comfortable position in an office
chair.” He never sat in an office chair—has lived
for over 40 years not 20 miles from where the whole
thing happened.

c Dependability
a motor car is the one essential for positive
satisfaction. Upon dependability, its capacity as a
means of transport is judged. This fundamental char-
acter must be inherent, it cannot be added as extra
equipment. Dependability is the proper functioning
of every detail, a full measure of control under all
conditions, that degree of quality which ensures maxi-
mum comfort and performance.
m
u
Model X Touring Cars
emphasise dependability in the most effective way. Because the
quality of each car is the paramount consideration the CASE
Company has built up a reputation for dependability which is sur-
passed by no other car manufacturer.
Note some of the factors that ensure the dependability of the CASE.
A chassis which provides great strength and rigidity, with a frame
so sturdy as to protect the body and power units from deflection.
A high-grade six-cylinder engine of exceptional performance, respon-
sive in the highest degree, easily accelerated from walking pace to
thirty miles an hour in a few seconds.
Unique suspension and lowered centre of gravity ensures maximum
stability and safety at all speeds. Large bearing surfaces, provi-
sion for ample and positive lubrication, overside gears, brakes of
unusual effectiveness these are all features that contribute' to
dependability, durability and satisfaction.
The substantially constructed CASE bodies ensure complete restful
relaxation and that measure of riding and driving comfort which
makes motoring a delight.

“Larry Longun”: There’s no need to go
as far as ex-German New Guinea for suit-
able cane for basket-making (B. 17/l/’24).
Tons of first-class stuff can be had in the
Blackall Range district (S.Q.), where the
lawyer- and other canes grow in profusion.
Some years back, when I was timber-getting
there, baskets of various descriptions in all
stages of construction could be seen about
the camps, the boys being basket-making
crazy.

“Atir” : The Lands Titles Office of S. Aus.
found 1923 the heaviest year in its history—
its record beat that of 1920, when the post-
war land-boom was at its height. The
amount borrowed on mortgage during the
year was £8,695,713; and the total number
of registrations under the Torrens system
was 56,710. As the rate of interest was
higher than it has been for many years past,
South Aus. faces the future with a nice
millstone round its neck. Incidentally, the
Department returned a net profit of £23,440
over and above the cost of administration.
*•***■
“Adelaide”: The hotel known as Ware’s
Exchange since 1868 is to Jose the first half
of its name, the Ware family having at last
given it up. It was built as the Australian
Arms away back in 1839. Coppin, the
actor, altered its name to the Exchange
when he had it from 1847 to 1852. For
many years it has been carried on by Mrs.
Ware or her sons, one of whom is A. W.
Ware, once Mayor of Adelaide and later
well known in Sydney and Queensland. The
new lessee is W. A. Piper, with a reputation
as a live wire in sport.
* * * *
“Spreader” : The trawler Thistle, manned
by Captain Kenny and a crew of one-time
North Sea fishermen, lately unloaded a catch
of 150 boxes of flatliead, mostly from Two-
fold Bay, on the Melbourne fish market. The
ejles lasted three days. About 7s. per box
was averaged the first day, 10s. the second
and 18s. the third. The skipper, albeit he
reckoned on getting at least 255. per box
all round, put to sea again to reap another
harvest. An average price for deep-sea flat-
head at the Spencer-street markets is £2 per
box, and the demand is strong enough to keep
a dozen Thistles in constant work. It looks
as if the fish-ring in the southern city is
in for some long-overdue bumps. Still, that
very largely depends on how far the public
will rally to the support of the intruder.
* * * *
“Senojo” : The appearance of the fruit-fly
in Mildura should awaken orchardists to the
necessity of understanding more about the
pests that are likely to attack their fruit.
Most growers rely too much on inspectors,
and these cannot be expected to keep a watch
on every tree and vine in the district. A
grower’s first-hand knowledge of the symp-
toms of a previously unencountered visitation
would save a lot of trouble. That the Mil-
dura growers didn’t fall over themselves in
their hunt for knowledge is shown by the
fact that the writer in 1917 had occasion
to inspect a very fine collection of entomo-
logical works in the Mildura public library.
The volumes had been in the institution, I
was informed, for 10 years, and, although
the works were superbly illustrated and
directly concerning pests likely to invade the
district, most of the pages were still uncut.
“Pohutu”: The green waters of Cook
Straits (M.L.) closed over a staunch old
craft when the Union Co. scuttled the
freighter Poherua the other day. The an-
cient tub had been in the co.’s service since
the days when ships of a thousand tons
were magnificent liners, and it is likely she
circumnavigated both islands more times than
any other boat that could be named. For
many years she was in the West Coast coal
trade, and battled down against the big seas
which thunder along the shores about West-
port and Greymouth. She was a sort of
training-ship for skippers, and not a few
of the men now handling the Red Funnel
liners in the Pacific got their first command
thus. Her total earnings must have been
something colossal; until recent years she
was rarely laid up. Her speed was a joke,
and if she sank as slowly as she steamed
the denizens of the ocean-bed must have had
plenty of warning of her coming.
* * * *
“8. Ryder”: Tiie Bulletin’s comments
on the Australian wheat yield (14/2/’24'l
are quite to the point. But there is a still
greater anomaly in the maize yields. The
statistics for N. S. Wales show 25.20 bushels
to the acre where it seems possible to grow
300. I have authenticated records showing
that experimental plots in the U.S.A. gave
230 bushels per acre. Six cobs exhibited at
a recent Pambula (N.S.W.) show yielded
61b. 7oz. of shelled grain. If every cob on
an acre weighed that much, the yield would
be in the region of 300 bushels. The best
on the Manning in competition trials was
only 80 bushels. It has been said the 150-
busliel mark has been reached on the Snowy
River flats at Orbost (Vic.), where they
have the best mixture of soil deposit in the
world. There must be something wrong
somewhere when the average is so much be-
low that of other countries. For one thing,
it is certain that not enough attention is
paid to seed-selection. Whether it’s maize
or wheat or anything else this vital point
calls for far more pains than the average
Australian is inclined to give it.
HEN FRUIT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The president of the Housewives’ Association (Miss
Portia Geach) said that the association advocated
the stamping of eggs with the grower’s name.”
I live upon the city street,
And have no chance to know
The kind of land where muttons bleat,
And beef gets tough enough to eat,
And slipstone hen-fruit grow.
And jet the place seems clear to me—
The gentle orchard row,
Ten-bushel crops on ev’ry tree,
And growers filled with holy glee
To see the hen-fruit grow.
And when I weary of the grind
Of city ways I’ll go
And watch, with an untroubled mind
And patches in mj' pants behind,
The juicy hen-fruit grow.

Accuracy
to One-Half
Thousandth of
an Inch!
There are 360 mechanical operations on
the three types of Studebaker cars that
must be kept within the limits of one-
half thousandth of an inch. The tolerance
on 1120 additional operations is one-
thousandth of an inch!
To these rigid standards of manufacture
Studebaker owners owe the long, de-
pendable service and low operating cost
of their cars.
Today, after seventy-two years in busi-
ness, the Studebaker name stands as
assurance of high quality, honest value
and fair dealing. We invite you to in-
spect the thirteen Studebaker models —
all of which are powered by six-cylinder
engines.

“M. 8.”: “Hanno” (B. 8/11/’23) asks,
"How many many Australian doctors go to
England to start in practice?” More than
lie has any idea of, I suspect. I am at pre-
sent out of reach of a medical register, out
can recall without an effort seven ot my own
years in Melbourne Uni. Five of them are
in London.
“Uramao”: Maoriland’s gift battleship,
presented by louseph Ward to the Admi-
ralty about 12 years ago, has been broken
up at Rosyth, and all that remains of her,
besides the unpaid bill, is an inkstand each
for Bill Massey and . James Allen, and a
cigar- and cigarette-casket tor '' ard all
made from material of the ship.
“Pat Bnshie”: Tell “Yoyang” (B.
7/2/’24j that Mrs. Frances Oakes —formerly
Small—was the first Australian free-born
child. She made her debut at Parramatta
in 178!). Mrs. Oakes’s parents arrived in
the First Fleet, and settled in the Parra-
matta district. Her husband was an M.L.G.
in the first Parliament.
“W.T.”: “8.F.” (B. 7/2/’24) says Wel-
lington (M.L.) began life as Britannia.
Britannia was the name given to the site on
which the settlement now known as Lower
Hutt stands. It was first intended to have
the provincial capital there; but the ground
was found to be liable to floods, so they
moved on to Port Nicholson. The name
Britannia was never applied to the new site.
Andrew M. Wooldridge (B. 14/2/’24),
one of the very last of 8. Aus.’s old squatter
kings, has passed his SOtli milestone. At
one time he owned Arcoona station, north-
west of Port Augusta, a little patch of 5000
sq, miles. Later he took up 20,000 sq. miles
at Barrow Creek, Central Aus. —one of the
largest tracts of country ever held by one
man. He floated that concern into a com-
pany, and 12.000 head of cattle were put
upon the big run.
“Sucre”: Fihelly, ex-Agent-General for
Queensland, started life as a telegraph-
messenger at Brisbane. Later an examina-
tion in the three R’s enabled him to get into
the clerical division of the service, but Gar-
diner. a S. Australian man who helped to
re-classify the Commonwealth service in
1902. kicked him into the general division.
Fihelly was then in the letter-sorting room,
and tiie knock-back turned him into some-
thing like a Bolshevik —and, incidentally,
into the member for Paddington.
Saul Solomon, of Northam (W.A.), is in
his 89th year, going strong. His father,
Joseph Solomon, of London, where Saul was
born, lived to well over 100. The son came
to Victoria at the time of the gold dis-
coveries, settled at Bendigo and Ballarat, and
ran a flourishing photographer’s business in
the city of statues. Later he became a
prominent citizen ,of Adelaide, and sat in
Parliament for East Torrens before going
into business at Mount Gambier in 1890.
Both in Vic. and S. Aus. he was a notable
Freemason.
Anglican Archdeacon Oakes, of Kelso
(N.S.W.) and native of Bathurst, will re-
tire from regular parochial work at the end
of this month, but will continue as chaplain
to the Bathurst Gaol. He is a grandson of
Francis Oakes, one of the Tahiti missionaries
who took refuge in Sydney in the colony’s
early days, having been driven from the
island by the natives. His grandmother, a
daughter of Sergeant John Small, of Gov-
ernor Phillip's bodyguard, is said to have
been the first white child born of free
parents in Australia. Two of the sons of
Francis Oakes settled at Bathurst as
stock and station agents, and a third,
George Oakes, sat for Parramatta in
the first three Parliaments and for East Syd-
ney in the seventh. He was an M.L.O. from
1879 until August 10, 1881, when he was
killed by a steam tram at the corner of King
and Elizabeth streets, his being the first life
sacrificed to that juggernaut.
“Bouragi” puts the Papuan to work
One of the few sensible things the Ministry for
Home and Territories has done in Papua is to
induce the natives to grow rice, which for
many years past has been supplanting yam, sago
and taro as the staple food of the native popu-
lation. The idea is one of the many originated
by William Macgregor. That wily pro-consul long
ago realised that the missionary, the trader and
the goldminer were keeping the poor heathen so
busy that he was left little time to grow his
native crops. Some of the Papuans, notably those
round Moresby, were beginning to depend on rice
alone, preferably rice given to them by the Govern-
ment. Besides being bad for the heathen, this
was expensive. But Macgregor was turned down,
and under his successors the project snored along
until the Papuan became largely a devourer of
imported rice. The idea of growing it was revived
about two years ago, and, though so far the experi-
ment has been tried only in the Gulf Division, this
season 181 tons have been harvested from 458
acres worked by about 2000 natives. It is “wet”
rice grown in shallow standing water. Another
variety can be grown anywhere, on hillsides or
low-lying country, and could be produced in most
parts of Papua. It is the ideal crop for the. Papuan,
who, save for some.of the Gulf tribes, loathes damp
and muddy conditions.
“Herodot” : It was a Sydney second-hand
bookseller, about whose shelves I was
prowling, who asked me if I would like to
see “something really good,” and, after a
furtive glance around, produced from under
one of the counters a bundle of paper-
covered, cheaply-printed obscenities. The
title page of each showed that it had been
printed in Switzerland; the prices were
marked in pounds, which suggested that some-
body was making a few hundreds per cent,
profit. In answer to my inquiries the book-
seller confided to me that treasures such as
these were smuggled into Australia by
sailors and ships’ stewards, and that,
although many local dealers had regular sup-
plies, they could not get half enough to meet
the demand. He further spoke of a “collec-
tor,” reputed to own the best lot of erotic
literature in the Commonwealth, who had
cheerfully parted with £25 for a Bible,
printed in Germany, in which many passages
were illustrated with quite phenomenal free-
dom and frankness. He capped his dis-
closures with the assurance that these high
prices have resulted in a beginning at pro-
ducing the stuff inside the Commonwealth,
and that some of the local efforts were “very
creditable.”

HISTORICAL
HEADGEAR—In the
early part of the eigh-
teenth century, the three-
cornered hat worn by the
famous"GREYS” regi-
ment was replaced by the
Mitre Cap . The two
merry troopers depicted
appear to be in no wise
uneasy wearing their new
style caps.
MANY Men smoke "GREYS” who cannot smoke
ordinary cigarettes. That is because " GREYS ”
are made from good, wholesome Virginia —no
gold leaf embellishments. You can forget you’ve got a
throat when you smoke " GREYS.” Round and smooth,
good to look upon, firm to the lips and friendly to the palate.

keep me going until knock-off time.
“It’s then I welcome my Rex Luncheon
Cheese sandwiches — they’re so sustaining,

“I like Rex Luncheon Cheese very much.
Its delightful piquancy gives an added zest

a regular favorite in our home.

Little Peter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
5 f i 1 WAS somewliere north of Daneland,
A colder coast and lorn,
That little Peter Petersen,
The freckled Swede, was born.
Aye, somewhere by the waterside
One unremembered morn.
lie sailed the Seven Seas betimes
With other freckled folk,
Whose red ancestors heard the songs
That savage throats awoke
When dripping oars swept out in line
From sea-bound hulls of oak.
But when at last the deep sad seas
Grew less importunate,
He turned his thought to coastal ways
And bought his small estate;
With homely things the landward folk
Their little world create.
There Peter in his garden plot
You’d find with spade and hOe}
Those lihnds that hauled on tarry sheets
the Lowlands Low
Now toiled with wondrous tenderness
To make a cabbage grow,
Then fell his death, by accident—
A faulty lock, they say—
So little Peter took the count
And softly went his way;
He lies beneath the bloodwoods tall
By Malagoutha Bay,
And when I pass by Peter’s place
I touch my hat to him,
And wonder if in death’s sweet sleep
From out his Nor’land grim
He hears an echo of the seas
On forelands far and dim,
I wonder if the night tides bring
O’er Malagoutha bar
Tire, sighing of the cordage and
The creaking of the spar,
A bos n's whistle, faintly blown,
A far-off smell of tar.
And when the Springtime gladly calls
Green glories from the ground,
I wonder if there comes to him
The old familiar sound
Of “Hem-e and go, My Nancy O!”
Or haply “Homeward Bound.”

“Gimme a Match!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(t ~l~ t LOi" said Puttifoot. “I-low’s the
pipe?”
The white-whiskered bellman,
biown to all Quart Pot as “Uncle,” faced
William Puttifoot, butcher at Denny
Deneen’s general providery.
“Gimme a match,” he said.
“I’ve gave y’ about six boxes already.”
They’re gorn. This pipe takes a lot o’
matches.”
pipe’s all right—it’s the smoker,”
replied Puttifoot, and then, repenting of his
Unkindness, invited Uncle to take the
matches from a coat hanging near by.
uncle took the matches—took them all-
ana proceeded to dissipate his new fortune.
He struck five that gave up the ghost before
lie could touch the tobacco with the flame,
and then, before he could well light the
tobacco from the seventh, he breathed heavily
and put it out.
“I’ll light it outer the wind,” he said, and
disappeared into the salt-room.
. He returned in time, the pipe still cold
m his mouth, and said, as if smoking were
not his business: “I don’t think I’ll ’ave a
smoke till dinner-time.”
“Can’t yer light her?” remarked Putti-
toot; and then, very coldly, “J ain’t goin’ to
—I got me work to do.”
"Orl right,” said Uncle; “I’m goin’ up the
street. But at the door he turned again
invited Puttifoot to inspect his trousers,
rhey re noo ’uns,” he explained. “Jack
Halvm gimme ’em. They was too big for
They fit me, though.” He walked
to tbe door to demonstrate the southerly ele-
vation of the garments; and, as he walked,
Penny, Deneen came in at the back door.
«w r „ . that’s Uncle at now?” asked Denny.
Walkm up an’ down like a ryle Bengal
tiger m a shircus?”
“I was just showin’ me noo pants. They
''as too big for Jack Galvin, an’ he guv ’em
ter me.
Oh, did he then? Them is fine pants,
too. Come back here, Uncle, an’ walk for
me.
Uncle obeyed, walked to Denny, turned
gravely, and walked away again; and at the
door awaited the applause.
“My word, them’s great pants, Uncle. I
seu now why Jack Galvin give them to you.
1 hey re shlandrous throusers, so they are
Whin you walk they make faces at you
behind your back, Uncle; diagn’l faces they
tnake at you, Uncle—chriss-chross, chriss-
chross ; left face, right face; offside to near-
side, an back agin. Ugly faces they make
behind your back whin you walk.”
, Grrr! said Uncle, departing hurriedly.
jHrlwyS’ gettin’ on ter me you are, Mister
Denny crossed to the hotel, looked at the
occupant of the long bench on the verandah
?nd entered the bar. The man on the bench
had been but three days in Quart Pot lie
has a drover from out of the West who’ hav-
ing delivered his cattle at the Border’after
long months of droving from the Territory
had found Deneen’s whisky good, and so hsri
stayed; relaxing himself and getting a new
hngle on life after that long, dreary, enduring
duty, bringing beef on its feet two thousand
hnles at seven miles a day. Quiet and spar-
es®* words for those long months, the sense
of duty done and the virtuous glow it brings
had made him an easy mark for John Bariev-
horn. After a day’s quiet drinking this long
spare centaur became garrulous- and the
oniy name they knew him by was the name
he had given himself, a name that his past
gave the lie to—-the only evidence of its truth
being that the man laughed with his drinks,
and Sang between them “The Bad Man from
Goondiwindi.”
As Denny entered the hotel the Bad Man
from Goondiwindi abandoned his medita-
tions, and resumed his vocal demonstrations
to maintain the reputation he had given him-
self.
“Three thousand head,” said the Bad Man
from Goondiwindi, addressing the empty
street. “Three thousan’ miles, Wave Hill to
Tenterfield, an’ never lost a hoof. I’m the
Bad Man from Goondiwindi. Never lost a
hoof. Good axeman, too. Chop a dam’
forest down in two-twos; an’ beat the socks
off all them Tasmanian blokes. Ride any-
thing that’ll take a saddle. I’m the Bad
Man from Goondiwindi. I can sing, too:
‘....Jim Donahue his name,
Of poor but honest parents; he was born in Castle-
maine,
He was his father’s hope and pride, he was his
mother’s joy j
An’ a terror to the troopers was the wild lierlonial
Boy. ”
No applause forthcoming from the empty
street, the Bad Man from Goondiwindi again
uplifted his voice and continued his parable
in plain prose, 1
“I know good country when I see it, too.
Saltbush country is all right for sheep; an’
Mitchell and Blinders grass for sheep and
cattle; wild geranium’s all right in the Cen-
tral. But gimme fifty thousan’ acres of
belar country—belar and coolabah—an’ I
Won’t call the ruddy Queen me aunt. That’s
the country, sweet and clean, an’ mixed
cattle very pretty in the grass. We’ll have a
sing-song agen !”
It was at this moment that Uncle, hear-
ing the song of the “Wild Kerlonial Boy”
while waiting at the curve of the street for
relief from the tongue of Denny Deneen,
decided that the singer represented enter-
tainment at the bar, and retraced his steps.
In his retirement he had used all but two
of Puttifoot’s matches; he struck the last
but one, and it was true to form and left his
pipe cold. Groaning in his heart, Uncle
crossed the road to the hotel as the Bad Man
from Goondiwindi again burst into song—the
form of which Mr. Rudyard Kipling appro-
priated to write something of Mandalay:
“On the road to Gundagai
When we made the money fly
And we spent it at Flash Harry’s on the road to
Gundagai.”
Uncle made a crab-like progression to the
side of the singer, and, leaning gracefully
against a barrel, waited for an interlude: —
“On the road to Gundagai”—
“Gimme a match,” said Uncle.
“Wliat!” shouted the Bad Man, and rising
suddenly he knocked Uncle down.
At the sound of the fall Denny Deneen
came to the door and looked out at Uncle
prone, and upon Uncle’s legs tubed in Jack
Galvin’s ex-trousers waving in the air, and
the Bad Man from Goondiwindi standing
over him crouched for fighting, and a willing
right and a dirty left ready for Uncle if he
should dare to rise. “What’s the matter
wit’ you?” demanded Denny Deneen. “Hittin’
an ould white-whiskered man that does
nothing worse than ate childer’s bread! Why
did you hit him, you big long shtreak of
good for not’ing? Eight feet high of fool-
ishness —why did you hit Uncle?”
“I thought he was a confidence man !”
“Him a confidence man! He’s not a man
an’ he have no confidence. Pie’s the town
bellman—shame on you liittin’ a poor
orphan! Get you up, Uncle; no man will
hit you while I’m here.”
“You’re all right, Mister Deneen,” said the
Bad Man. “I know you. But I thought
this old bloke was a con. man because I
was took down by a con. man in Brisb’ne
four year ago, an’ he said just the same as
this old bloke. Up he came to me, the con.
man did, just like your Uncle here, an’ he
says ‘Gimme a match’ just like your Uncle
did. So as soon as your Uncle says ‘Gimme
a match’ I give him a crack.”
“There, Uncle, an’ what did I tell you
then? ‘Gimme a match.’ ‘Gimme a pipe!’
‘Gimme a pair o’ pants!’ ‘Gimme a beer!’
Your mout’ is full o’ ‘gimme’; an’ this poor
man gave you your match an’ shparks before
your eyes, too.”
“I’m sorry I hit a old man if he isn’t a
con. man. I’ll pay your Uncle compensation.”
“Pie isn’t my Uncle. If I had a’ uncle
like that I’d make me aunt a widder. He’s
annybody’s uncle —the world's uncle. Lift
Uncle up an’ brush down Jack Galvin’s
trousers.”
The Bad Mail from Goondiwindi tenderly
assisted PTncle to his feet and dusted the
southerly elevation of Jack Galvin’s trousers
with a handkerchief, making honorable
amends as he brushed. “Don’t blame me for
liittin’ you,” he said. “Ever since I was
took down by the con. man, if a stranger
says to me ‘Gimme a match’ I hook him
one. I hit three strangers in one day in
Tenterfield last week. There wasn’t a con.
man in the lot; but y’ never know. Come
in an’ have a drink, Uncle, me poor feller.”
Uncle accepted graciously, and had three
drinks. Over the second beer he swore
fealty to the Bad Man and carried out the
contract to the letter. It was not a one-sided
contract, either. Uncle gave a fidelity appa-
rently as immutable as the Laws of the
Medes and Persians (which have altered
many times since they uttered the conserva-
tive boast that they changed not), and lis-
tened to the Bad Man’s long descriptions of
grasses and timbers and stock routes, and
provided the Bad Man’s singing with an
audience; and Bad Man, the party of the
other part, provided beer, food, tobacco and
matches.
After three days of the partnership Uncle
was satisfied that he had been appointed for
life. He listened not so well, but his shame-
less flattery of the Bad Man to the Bad
Man’s face expanded to praise of the Bad
Man’s cruel blows to all strangers.
“Tell y’ what he done,” said Uncle enthu-
siastically, to the bar audience and in the
presence of the Bad Man —“I’m ’ere, an’
Goondiwindi’s there. Up I comes an’ savs.
‘Gimme a match, Bill’ (puff puff) the
dam’ thing’s gone out! Well, up I comes,
an’ I says ‘Gimme a match,’ an’ up he
comes an’ hits me on the nose. Never see a
beautifuller blow. Gimme a match (puff,
puff). What’s the matter with this pipe?
Gimme a match. Mine’s a beer. Gimme a
match, Goondy.”
Goondiwindi supplied the matches, but
as if under protest. Uncle had his beer and
jet another and “borrowed” eight matches

HOME ACCIDENTS Make
ZAM-BUR a Daily Need.
Burns, Scalds, Cuts and Abrasions are inevitable in every
home, and the wise mother always keeps close at hand that
perfect first-aid —Zam-Buk.
A touch of Zam-Buk allays smarting pain swiftly; but,
more important, Zam-Buk’s powerful antiseptic properties
ensure against the dangers of germ infection, and the process
of sound, healthy healing is at once begun.
Zam-Buk carries on its antiseptic healing without
hindrance, because the work is not impeded by the presence
of any of the coarse animal fats and mineral poisons that are
to be found in many common salves.
The absolute safety, constant reliability, and the unique
healing qualities of Zam-Buk make it a necessity in the
home. Every medicine-chest should contain its box of
Zam-Buk. 1/6 and 3/6 of all Chemists and Stores.

Severely Burned While Cooking.
Zam-Buk Proves an Ideal Healer.
“While cooking,” says Mrs. M. Seymour, of
Godrich Street, East Perth, “a pan of scalding
fat upset all over my feet. To make matters
worse, stocking dye got into the broken skin.
Before I had time to realise it, blood-poison set
in, and for weeks the foot was in a raw,
horrible state. The doctor could give no ease,
and inflammation spread right up into the knee.
Whilst laid-up and disabled I came to hear
about Zam-Buk, and it proved almost magica
in subduing the pain and irritation. Further
dressings of the balm quickly drew out all in-
flammation, corruption and soreness. Under the
Zam-Buk treatment I progressed rapidly. In a
couple of weeks the foot and leg were, hea e
and made thoroughly sound and strong.’
SOOTHING, PURIFYING & HEALING
from four men in turn and dissipated them
all vainly, and then left suddenly at
the call of the sergeant, who told him that a
sale by oi’der of the Land Bailiff demanded
Uncle’s professional services in campanology
and oratorio.
“We’ll have a rest now,” said the barman.
“By cripes, Uncle’s dead strong on cadgin’
matches.”
“He’d wake up a dead man an’ say,
‘Gimme a match,’ ” said Goondiwindi.
“Sometimes when he asks me for a match
every other minute I’m dam’ glad I hit him
on the nose. I’m gettin’ full of him. He
called me Goondy, too.”
“He’d wear out his welcomes in a brew-
ery and a match factory in the same day,”
said the barman. “The way he can’t keep a
matcli alight is better than fire insurance.”
“ ‘Gimme a match ! Mine’s a beer,’ ‘Gimme
a match! Got any t’bacca?’ ‘Mine’s a beer!
Gimme a match !’ ” said Goondiwindi, in imi-
tation of Uncle —“I’m full up of him. I’ll
give him a match. I’ll fix him!”
With these words Goondiwindi left the
bar and proceeded to prospect Deneen’s pad-
dock.
Uncle, blind to his waning popularity, re-
turned to his barrel on the hotel-verandah,
climbed .upon it and waited for the unwary.
His pipe was in his mouth, but cold and dis-
enjoyable. Seeing Puttifoot driving the
butcher’s cart, Uncle hailed him, and Putti-
foot drew up. As usual, Uncle sain, •'Gimme
a match,” and Puttifoot used bad language
and drove on. Uncle sat upon the barrel
and waited.
The sergeant passed into the hotel to see
Denny Deneen, J.P., he having been directed
there from the store; and the sergeant
laughed at the demand for a match and
passed on. And then Goondiwindi came
round the corner of the hotel from the sandy
paddocks; and Uncle, seeing at last the
source of an unfailing supply of matches,
sat upon the barrel as any other pampered
loafer on a throne, and lifted up his imperi-
ous voice as to a slave: “Gimme a match.”
“Righto,” said Goondiwindi, advancing
and holding out to Uncle as he came to the
barrel a long tin box that promised a very
wilderness' of matches. “Keep the box,
Uncle.”
“Good enough,” said Uncle, accepting the
present as his due and just tribute.
“Y’ see, Goondy,” said Uncle, slowly
opening the box as he talked, “most o’ these
matches go out on me; must be Japanese
matches.”
He had opened the box, and then horror
seized him. Half a dozen vigorous bull-
dog ants, each an inch and a half long, mad
with rage of their imprisonment and ready
to fight anything that moved, rushed blindly
out of the box and fastened on Uncle’s
hands. Three of them fell on Uncle’s knees,
but they sped upwards again, and entered
Uncle’s shirt at the breast-bone. For blind
fury, insensate courage and sudden venom
there is nothing in nature more fierce and
quick than a bulldog ant. And these that
had been presented to Uncle were raving
lunaties, by reason of their digging up by
Goondiiwindi and his patient and careful in-
carceration of them one by one in the big
matchbox.
Uncle’s first yell brought Denny Deneen
and the sergeant to the door ; they saw
Uncle, suddenly energetic—possessed by a
very devil of energy, indeed—rush from the
verandah howling and clawing at himself,
and by turns trying to throw his hands
away. He ran around the corner of the
hotel towards his old home in the bootroom,
still howling and revolving like a whipped
top.
“What did y’ do to him, then?” asked
Deneen. “He’s a revolution. He moves!
He moves! He seems to feel the frill of
life along his keel! What’s come to him?”
Goondiwindi stopped his cruel laughter.
“I’m full up o’ his ‘Gimme a match,’ an’
I gave him a full box —full o’ bull-ants.”
“Is that all? ’Twon’t hurt him; an’
’twill:; be a good t’ing for him if his little
shkull can remember even bull-ants for more
than a day. But he will be bitten grayvious.
Y’ should take him metliulated spirit to rub
on him where they have hurted him.”
“Have a heart,” said the half-repentant
Goondiwindi. “I’ll take him whisky.”
“He won’t rub it on the bites—he’ll drink
it,” said the sergeant.
“I know that,” replied Goondiwindi. “I’ll
take him two.”
“Well, Uncle,” said Denny Deneen the
day after Uncle had fallen into the ambush
of bull-ants, “were you hurted much, Uncle?
Did they bite you, Uncle? Or break their
beaks on your shkin ?”
“They wus bad,” replied Uncle, the in-
curable. “But Goondy give me a whisky
an’ two bob damages. Gimme a match.”
Denny sighed his despair and handed him
a box.
“You open it,” said Uncle, his mind full
of bulldog ants.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE Government Residency at Waikerere
was one of those unlovely corrugated-
iron structures the Austral-Papuan
facetiously calls “European.” In the “south-
east season,” when the cooling trade wind
tempered the blistering rays of the tropic
sun, it was barely habitable; when the mon-
soon set in, and the dry bulb and the wet
climbed side by side, until for days on end
the mercury remained stationary in the mid-
i, u sweltering, suffocating
inferno.
Manson, the district magistrate, sat in the
tiny court-room dispensing justice and pro-
fanity with equal fluency. The air was
heavy with the mingled odors of sweat-
sodden police uniforms, unwashed, unclothed,
mop-haired prisoners, and the acrid fumes
from a smouldering heap of sandalwood, with-
out -which swarms of vicious mosquitoes
would have taken possession of the court.
Manson mopped his streaming face with
a towel. His head throbbed; his eyes
smarted; he felt as if all his vital energy
had oozed away.
“Clear the court, Sergeant,” he called,
listlessly; “and bring in Samori.”
Samori was one of Manson’s failures. Two
years ago the Dapa people, of whom Samori
was chief, had waylaid and murdered two
runaway carriers. Manson recalled that the
chief himself had gouged out the eyes of
the victims before cutting their throats with
a bamboo knife —a mode of execution which
had evoked the blasphemous condemnation of
even Manson’s “savages in serge.”
The Dapa people were outside the sphere
of Government influence; nevertheless the
magistrate had made a lightning-like patrol
into the mountains, the police carbines had
spoken, firesticks had sent up the village
huts in sheets of flame, and a badly fright-
ened but chastened mountain tribe, hitherto
turbulent and intractable, had sworn fealty
to the white man’s Government.
No prosecution followed, as Manson be-
lieved that in murdering the strangers
Samori’s people had simply acted in accord
with their age-old traditions, and had already
been sufficiently punished. When inquiring
into the reason for putting out the eyes of
the runaways, he had been faced with that
blank wall of native superstition or stu-
pidity called “fashion b’long New Guinea,”
and had accordingly dismissed the incident
from his mind.
For two years the Dapa people had given
no trouble. Every month Samori had sent
cordial greetings, accompanied by presents
of native food, to the “Gavamani” on the
coast. On one occasion the chief himself
had visited the station and begged Manson
to make him a village constable, and the
magistrate had laughingly agreed to recom-
mend him for the honor. Manson felt that
his work in pacifying his turbulent neigh-
bors was something of an achievement, and
the dry, cold commendation he had received
from headquarters—the Papuan magistrate's
equivalent of “mentioned in despatches”—
had encouraged him to believe that he was
marked for speedy promotion.
He was therefore shocked and surprised
when, by devious routes, news filtered
through to the coast that Samori had trapped
and brutally murdered a party of time-ex-
pired laborers returning to their homes. The
magistrate’s answer to the challenge was
swift and certain. The village was carried
without opposition; Samori willingly sur-
rendered himself and his accomplices, and,
to Manson’s disgust, seemed to regard liis
breach of faith in the light of an achieve-
ment deserving of the Government’s warm-
est commendation. The murderers were to
stand their trial in the lower court that day,
and, having tasted the white man’s clem-
ency, would ultimately experience the white
man’s justice.
Manson leaned back in his chair, his mind
vaguely troubled. He sensed dimly that
Samori’s baffling attitude was not defiance,
but was due rather to some strange, indefin-
able native superstition of which white men
knew nothing. Manson was no anthropolo-
gist, neither was he a lawyer; but he “knew
niggers”—or thought he did.
His reverie was interrupted by the appear-
ance of Sergeant Lohoro and the manacled
prisoner. Samori was a typical mountain
man —short, sturdy, well-built and dark-
skinned. Save for a girdle of tapa-cloth he
was quite naked, and. as the sergeant hustled
him into the room, his white, even teeth —
unstained by betel-nut—flashed in a cheerful
grin.
"Goo’-day, taubada!” he boomed.
“Hereva lasi! (“Shut up!”) growled
Lohoro.
A native orderly, whose red- and yellow-
braided uniform proclaimed him the court
interpreter, entered softly. Manson slipped
a sheet of foolscap into a battered type-
writer, and the case opened.
“Ask this man, Sefa, if he killed these
laburi people,” said the R.M.
There followed an exchange of harsh gut-
turals ; the soft Melanesian dialects are not
spoken in the Papuan hinterland.
“Yessah!” said the interpreter presently.
“He say true he bin kill’m.”
“Why did he kill them?”
Sefa repeated the question ; then, turning
to the magistrate, explained: “Because the
Gov’ment bin talk all same.”
“Which Government?” snapped the R.M.
The question seemed to cause the inter-
preter some uneasiness, but the prisoner
literally beamed as he replied. “You, tau-
bada,” translated Sefa. “Before, two year
he go now, you tell him he kill all strange
people.”
Manson pushed back his chair and rose
slowly to his feet. “Listen to me, Sefa,”
he said, menacingly. “If you don’t talk true
talk, I’ll knock your blasted head off!”
Sergeant Lohoro seized the prisoner by
the elbow and shook him vigorously. “You
bushman!” he snorted, unmindful of
Samori’s ignorance of even colloquial “pid-
gin,” “wha’s matter you try humbug ’long
my taubada?”
“Ask him again, Sefa,” ordered Manson.
He waited patiently whilst an excited con-
versation passed between the two men. The
interpreter turned to the magistrate and
shrugged his shoulders resignedly. “Samori
say you bin tell’m he kill all strange people;
he t'ink maybe you make’m villos cons’ble;
he say one t’ing he no pull’m out eye b’long
these people.”
“What has that got to do with it?”
snapped the R.M. Then, suddenly, he was
conscious of an inkling of the truth. Open-
ing the depositions taken on his previous
visit to Dapa, his eye ran rapidly over the
typewritten sheets to the passage he sought.
Sefa had been interpreter on that occasion,
and, if Manson’s half-formed suspicion was
correct, the mystery was explained.
He beckoned the interpreter to approach,
and read from the depositions, in English:
“Why did Samori put out the eyes of these
men—to cut their throats was surely
enough?” “Now, Sefa,” said Manson, “say
that over to me in Motuan. No matter
Dapa talk; no matter English; talk the
Motu language.”
Sefa tremblingly translated the passage
into Motuan—a language most Papuan
police-officers.speak fluently.
“I thought so,” said Manson. grimly;
then, gripping the interpreter by his woolly
hair and the slack of his rami, he flung him
through the open doorway.
Sefa had translated the question: “The
Government says you were quite right to cut
the throats of these people, but you ought
not to have put out their eyes. That
fashion is no good!”
