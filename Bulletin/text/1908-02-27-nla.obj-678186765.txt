THE MINUS POET
OF poets it has been said that some
are born and the others have only
themselves to blame. There are
three kinds of poets : Poets, Minor Poets
and Minus Poets. Poets are those that
are dead. Minor Poets get their
majority when they the join the majority.
But the Minus Poet never dies.
Of the daily stream of verse that
floods The Bulletin and The Lone Hand
mail-boxes an average of from three to
eight per cent, of contributions is
accepted; the others are written not
by poets but by the correspondents whom
we politely answer in a certain column.
But to be rejected does not signify incur-
able badness ; most of the basketed verse
is neither good nor bad. It is simply
trite, or vacant of thought, or devoid of
inspiration, or commonplace, or imitative.
But occasionally there comes a poem that
is not only bad or wicked, but incorri-
gible. Of specimens of the incurable poem
here is a limited selection. The poets sent
these alleged verses in with the confident
belief that they would be printed and
paid for. They are, and will be, for their
badness is almost artistic.
Patriotic :
THE LAND OF AUSTRALIA.
Astronomers can boast of their planet called
Mars,
And plains and canals that they say they can see
When for causes scientific they’re exploring the
stars ;
Whether it’s true or not it’s quite immaterial to
me;
For- our land has its mountains, valleys, and
bowers,
Where in praise of the Creator the birds warble
on high,
O’er river bends laden with native wild flowers
That bloom in the springtime, and rival in
splendor the sky.
(Chorus omitted out of kindness.)
The States in this land have been lately incited
To join hands and federate from centre to sea.
’Twas for mutual protection, that’s why they
united ;
Even Nature has meant they should always agree;
For we’re a Federated people in Austral’s fair
land,
We have no racial antipathies a free people to
sever,
But for God and the right we firmly must stand,
Guarding our liberty and friendly to others for
ever.
Then here’s to the brightest gem in the southern
main :
May her leaders’ voices for liberty ever resound ;
Men who know the people’s rights, and will them
maintain.
This virtue can only in a true statesman be found ;
He, knowing his country's welfare lies in industry
and peace,
Is a truer patriot than he who conquers a world.
His name will be famed for ages until time may
cease,
And he will freedom proclaim when our ensign’s
unfurled.
Our Commonwealth Poet.
Nautical :
THE SAILOR’S FAREWELL.
When I’m sailing on mid ocean,
Where the sky and sea doth blend,
When the winds howl wild around you,
Bear in mind your absent friend.
I may ne’er return my darling,
God, who watcheth all, knows best,
He'who sends the moonlight gleaming,
Guards your sailor’s lonely rest.
Life is fraught with many a danger,
Sailor’s, more than many, be
Bur He whose birth was in a manger
Guides the sailors on the sea.
So when I am on the ocean,
When the night is dark and cold,
Think of me your absent lover,
Braving dangers all untold.
You will comfort mother, darling,
Mother, weary worn and sad !
Kneeling by the lone hearth, praying
For her absent sailor lad.
Farewell, now, for I must leave you,
Tear myself from your dear side;
But if ever I return, dear,
You must be my sailor’s bride.
Brilte Harding.
Domestic :
A CHILD’S QUESTION.
Why do you weep, mother ?
Why is your face so sad
Said little Maggie May,
When everything else is glad ?
In the' meadows the daisies bloom,
The birds on the tree tops sing
So why do you weep mother ?
Can I do anything ?
Oh child I weep because,
My heart is heavy with care,
Everything seems to be going wrong,
Father is never here ;
But after work is over goes to the Public house,
IN over comes home till morning.
Then he does nothing but rouse
But go away and play dearie
■ Mother will cry no more
Everything will come right some day
That I feel quite sure
And you are mother’s darling,
And help her every day
With your dear little loving arms.
And your bright and winning way ;
So run away and play dearie, run away and play.
B. Flower.
Moral :
THE STAR OF SUCCESS.
Be brave and bold you bright Lad.
If one Hope is broken,
At once a new one is bred,
And your Star of Success is smiling ahead.
Be brave and bold, don’t go astray
\ our Star is up.
See there far away (amidst dark and grey).
A Light of Hope it sends you gay.
And if closed all Gates should be,
Don’t lose your Hope,
Let Future see,
\ our Star of Success shining bright to thee.
Jens Eekhoff.

Pathetic :
GILBERTON DEBATE.
I wish them luck and happness in the golden
valley far
where they debate out beneath 4 the stars
they debate until the night grows late
on leders feeders bucks and slate
well I remember those days that have long past
away
when I used to foller those seams of clay
but things have altered with me
as I now roam the hills of liberty
I am now A lonley didder in the rangs far away
where I look for gold and coppir bars and think
of better days
so through all the day I roam these hills
and when the lights grow dim
I think of those that are far away, and I am lonley
still J
I can hear thump of A wallaroo as he comes to
lonley spring
where I water the good old stud just as the light
grows dim
dim-dim.
THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN
AMONG the pernicious books which
this generation was forced to read
in its youth, such as Smile's Self
Help, How a Penny Became a Thousand
Pounds, and Adam Smith’s Wealth of
Nations, none seems—on re-reading at
maturity—more painful than Lord Ches-
terfield's Advice to his (Illegitimate) Son.
A recent issue of this piece of snobbery,
published by Philip Wellby (London)’
furnishes an excuse to throw things at
Chesterfield, senior.
Of the Letters, which were published
after Chesterfield’s death, Dr. Johnson
said, “ Take out the immorality, and it
should be put into the hands of every
young gentleman.” The present bowd-
lerised edition has taken out the im-
morality, but the snobbery survives.
Chesterfield was a man of the world, but
his world was a small one. He writes for
Good Company, and this is his definition
of Good Company :
It consists chiefly (though not wholly) of
people of considerable birth, rank, and
character ; for people of neither birth nor
rank are frequently and very justly admitted
into it, if distinguished by any particular
merit, or eminence in any liberal art or
science. ... A company of people of the
first quality cannot be called good company
unless they are the fashionable and accredited
company of the place. And a company, con-
sisting wholly of people of very low condi-
tion, whatever their merits or talents may
be, can never be called good company. A
company composed wholly of learned men,
though greatly to be respected, is not meant
by the words Good Company : they cannot
have the easy and polished manners of the
world, as they do not live in it.
'if/
To this limited circle Chesterfield
wishes to introduce his illegitimate son ;
and he gives him rules that will make
him acceptable therein. For instance,
when you are in company, talk often, but
never talk long.
The height of abilities is, to have a frank,
open, and ingenuous exterior, with a prudent
and reserved interior ; to be upon your own
guard, and yet, by a seeming natural open-
ness, to put people off theirs. Never, in
conversation, attack whole bodies of any
kind ; for you may thereby make yourself a
great number of enemies. To answer only
“yes” or always “no” to any person,
without adding “ sir,” “my lord,” or
“ madam.” (as it may happen) is always ex-
tremely rude. A man of good breeding
should be acquainted with the forms and
particular customs of Courts. At Vienna
men always make curtsies, instead of bows,
to the Emperor ; in France nobody bows to
the King or kisses his hand ; but in Spain
and England, bows are made and hands are
kissed. ... A man of fashion who is seen
piping or fiddling at a concert degrades his
own dignity. If you love music, hear it ;
pay fiddlers to play to you, but never fiddle
yourself. We should use ourselves to carve
adroitly and genteelly, without hacking half
an hour across a bone, without bespattering
the company witli the sauce, and without
overturning the glasses into our neighbors’
pockets. A man who tells you gravely that
he cannot carve, may as well tell you he
cannot blow his nose ; it is both as easy and
as necessary. .. . Study to acquire that
fashionable kind of small talk or chit chat
which prevails in all polite assemblies. It
turns upon the public events of Europe, and
then it is at its best ; very often upon the
number, the goodness, or badness, the dis-
cipline or the clothing of the troops of
different princes ; sometimes upon the
families, the marriages, the relations of
princes and considerable people ; and some-
times the magnificence of public entertain-
ments, balls, masquerades, etc.
\»/
If you meet a man who has lost his
son, you should not say, “ Sir, I am sorry
for your loss,” but “I hope you dome
the justice to be convinced that I feel what-
ever you feel, and shall ever be affected
where you are concerned.” That is
enough to make a man go and lose his
wife.
If a man notoriously and designedly insults
and affronts you, knock him down ; but if
he only injures you, your best revenge is to
be extremely civil to him in your outward
behavior, though at the same time you
counterwork him, and return him the com-
pliment, perhaps with interest. In short,
let this be one invariable rule in your con-
duct. Never to show the least symptom of
resentment, which you cannot, to a certain
degree, gratify ; but always to smile where
you cannot strike.
These rules are simple, and Australians
should have no difficulty in acquiring the
entree to Good Company. Of course,
the perfect gentleman produced by such
advice will be <a mean and cowardly
human being. He would not make
enemies—and it is only by making
enemies that a man can do his work in
this world. He will not disclose his own
nature, while aiming at getting hold of
the weak points of everyone else. And
he is counselled to use underhand
methods where he is afraid to use the
fist.
Eating soup with your nose in your plate
is also vulgar. So likewise is smelling the
meat while on your fork, before you put it
in your mouth. Spitting on the floor or
carpet is a filthy practice. Never walk too
fast in the streets, which is a mark of vul-
garity, ill-befitting the character of a gentle-
man or a man of fashion, though it may be
tolerable in a tradesman.
V
As to the awkward man :
He eats with his knife to the great danger
of his mouth, picks his teeth with his fork,
and puts his spoon, which has been in his
throat twenty times, into the dishes again.
When he drinks, he infallibly coughs in his
glass, and besprinkles the company. Besides
all this, he has strange tricks and gestures.
But, in a genteel page like this, it is
hardly proper to specify those tricks and
gestures—though the Polite Philosopher
has no scruples. One suspects from this
book that Chesterfield was a bore. He
feared nothing so much as raillery and
sarcasm. His fiercest hatred is toward
the absent-minded man. Not only could
that individual never make “any observa-
tions upon the characters, customs, and
manners of the company ” —which seems
to Chesterfield the chief aim of life, but
Chesterfield states that he “ cannot stand
inattention and awkwardness.”
The absent man very plainly tells me that
he does not think me worth his attention.
And even this philosopher of politeness
seems sometimes guilty of the commonest
vulgarity.
Suppose you invited anybody to dine or
sup with you, you ought to recollect if you
had observed that they had any favorite
dish, and take care to provide it for them ;
and when it came, you should say, “ You
seemed to me, at such and such a place, to
give this dish preference, and therefore I
ordered it. This is the wine that I observed
you liked, and therefore I procured some ’
As for the world outside Chesterfield’s
drawing-room, he complacently observes'
The herd of mankind can hardly be said
to think ; their notions are almost all adon.
tive ; and, in general, I believe it is better
that it should be so, as such common n re .
judices contribute more to order and quiet
than their own separate reasonings would
do, uncultivated and unimproved as thev
are.
As to gallantry—in a world where
gallantry was the fashion—Chesterfield’s
advice amounted to this : “ You wifi
doubtless live as other young men of you r
set do, but avoid promiscuous amours
which are ruinous in every Avay ; attach
yourself to some accomplished woman of
high rank who will introduce you to the
best society, and advance your progress
in your profession ; do everything you
can to fix her regard, but if other bonnes
fortunes come in your way, you will be a
fool to reject them.”
\»/
And what of this youth whom the
father attempted to drill into the perfect
gentleman 1 First, as to his birth.
Chesterfield—this Philosopher of Polite-
ness—is said to have made a bet to
seduce, first, a notorious prude, and,
second, the most beautiful of several
girls to whom she stood in the relation-
ship of a salaried governess. Though the
allegation of the bet is not corroborated,
Chesterfield, then a British Ambassador
at the Hague, added the governess,
Madame du Bouchet, to his long list of
conquests, and she became the mother of
his only son the precious hopeful
whom he smothered with advice. The
father afterwards married, and in his will
left Madame du Bouchet £5OO “ as some
compensation for the injury he had done
her.” This public insult Madame spurned
as an outrage. W. H. Craig, in his Life
of Lord Chesterfield , remarks that, “ like
the dying kick of a vicious mule, it seems
prompted only by an instinctive desire
to wound.”
As for the boy, neither an education
at Winchester, supplemented by “ The
Grand Tour,” nor the continued receipt
of his father’s letters, could give him
either manners or morals. “He was a
plain man, shy and gauche, with no
particular talent.” And only on his death
did his estimable father discover that he
had been secretly married, and left
behind him two children. We do
know what became of two historical
characters whom their fathers endowed
with good advice, Chesterfield, junior,
and Rehoboam ; and from these analogies
we suspect that the son of the self-made
merchant has become a church elder or
an alderman.
Among the contents of the latest Science
Progress there is a timely article upon “The
Photography of Color,” called forth by the
recent discovery of a commercially useful
solution o’f the problem of photography in
color by Lumiere, Warner-Powrie, andothers.
The other articles, all extremely technical,
range from “The Repair of a Nerve” to
an investigation of the conditions of great
pressure and great heat under which miners
and divers work.

Impotence.
When I gaze from a height on the limitless blue
of the sea,
Where the ships are as toys crawling out to the
edge of the world,
Then it is that I doubt if the Earth ever thinks
about Me !
And in maelstroms and eddies of rage I am
instantly whirled.
When I look at vast cliffs staring into Eternity’s
face,
With the slow, booming surf at the foot and the
blind brutal force
Of the wave moving in to its death and its shroud
of white lace,
Then I whisper, high up on the brink, “ / don’t
matter —of course ! ”
When I ask of the big, naked world as it dreams
in the sun,
Why I live what I am—whence I came—where
my spirit must go?
A great surge bursts in spray on the rocks like
the boom of a gun,
And the wind seems to wearily sigh, “ Well, I
really don’t know ! ”
In Immensity s face I defiantly flourish my card
To the thunder of years rolling out from
Eternity’s breast,
While mad, fugitive Time, terror-stricken, with
body all scarred
And with wind-parted beard, hurries over the
hills to his rest.
lam crushed by the cliffs—-I am drowned in the
merciless sea,
And a swift, robber wind from the spaces hath
taken my soul.
Ah ! A faint shriek of terror—a stir like a crab—
and I flee
With my horrified gamp to the city—Humanity’s
hole.

The Gods Within.
To gods in other worlds
We weary mortals pray ;
With other gods again
Perchance are pleading they ;
Perchance to us on earth
Are prayers uplifted far
From other beings pale
Who own another star.
To gods in other worlds
We lift our hands in vain ;
With other gods afar
They plead in idle pain ;
To us on gleaming earth,
In ever fruitless wise,
From lowlier distant worlds
The poor petitions rise.
If we be gods as they
Why should we plead with them ?
Why hail them as divine,
Why kiss their garments’ hem ?
No more we’ll beg the skies
To hear a suppliant’s song—
The gods without are weak,
The gods within are strong !

I hear a sound of weeping, and a voice that mur-
murs “Blind,
Blind is the world to the woes of them that cry
from the crawling deep ! ”
Dong-g-g ! And I see, in my thoughts, a long,
sad, slow procession go
Through grey, sad streets, their mournful eyes
set steadfast on the ground ;
Their elbows bare, their garments green with age,
and utter woe
Writ deep upon each brow; they pass, and
make no sign nor sound !
Dong-dong-g-g! A dirge that dwells upon the
sorrows of the poor !
(Hear the chop-hound that haunts the far, waste
places of our yard,
Voicing his grief, in sympathy !) Ding-dong-g-g !
And, swift and sure
My heart sinks to my boots, like fried eggs
sinking into lard.
Ding-g-g ! And I mind the time I stole the fowls
at Charlie’s Creek !
Mercy for me, who shook the fruit, in summer,
years agone !
(Still, I’d have done it yesterday !) Wild, brazen
voices speak
Of torments—aye, of boiling oil that waits Hell’s
hobs upon !
Cheer up, poor heart! It is the church bell,
calling men to pass
The plate in collars snowy ; and in nice-tailed
Sunday suits
To bask within the light that shines from Heaven
(through crimson glass)
On silken frocks, and heron-plumes, and shiny
hats and boots.
Dong-g-g! It’s the church bell ! Therefore,
slough your short sac-coat of sin ;
Put on the broadcloth robe of righteousness, and
pass within !

How to Address Betters.
Correspondents to Thk Bulletin ivould oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regal'd to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper-
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and. even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
ahvays is.

THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1908.
THE AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL AND
MR. RICHARD TEECE.
On Wednesday, February 19, Mr. Richard
Tkece, of the A.M.P. Society, added—in the
Sydney Telegraph—his lengthy mite to the
Federal Capital controversy. It took the
shape of a report of a trip lie had taken to
Cooma, Mount Kosciusko, Adaminaby, Kiandra,
Turnut, etc., Assuming the usual attitude of
purely commercial Sydney—and the commercial
class of Sydney possesses a narrowness that passes
expression and understanding—Richard Tekce
came back with a very low opinion of Dalgety,
the Federal capital site selected, after careful in-
spection, by the Australian Parliament. True, he
apparently didn’t go to Dalgety—in fact, by his
own description of his journey, he carefully kept
16 miles away from it, even when he was
nearest to it —but he regarded it as an unfit
site all the same, which attitude was so
exactly like commercial Sydney that it caused no
surprise. Mr. Teece’s most notable grievances
were: (1) That a coach was once blown over
thereabouts (by a curious coincidence, a few years
ago half a dozen vehicles were blown over in one
day about Balmain and Leichhardt, Sydney).
(2) That the land is dog-poor, and still—doubtless
in consequence of its poverty—therejs likely to be
such a violent rush of population that the Snowy
River is “liable to pollution owing to settle-
ment.” On this ground he recommends Tumut,
which, he says, is splendidly rich country, .and at
the same time is so exempt from possibilities, of
settlement that the Yarrangobilly River—which is
to water Mr. Teece’s proposed Tumut capita)—
will never be liable to pollution , under
any conditions at all. Mr. Teece, who
denounces the Dalgety site without going
th ere —merely, it would seem, because it
is the fashion of Sydney commercialism to de-
nounce everything the Australian Parliament
.does—is curiously suggestive of the attitude of
Wade and Carruthers, who boomed Canberra
without having' se'pn ft,, and cursed • Dalgety
long before they went there ; and of those Sydney
papers which assured the public enthusiastically
that Canberra was the very best site possible
without even sending a representative to look at
it and find out whether it was an ash-heap or a
dog-kennel. The simple rule, that the place
which the Australian Parliament has recommended
must be denounced, and that any place which it
doesn’t want must he boomed, seems to have
sufficed in each case. All the same, Mr. Tf.ece’s
sudden demand—tentatively backed up by the
Sydney Telegraph—for a capital at Turnut
seems to suggest that dry, wretched Canberra,
after being advertised for months as the one
blessed spot in N.S.W., has suddenly begun to be
pretty dead.
* ■* * »
It is a grievous pity, though, that the anti-
Federal grumblers who make a point of declaring
the utter unfitness of any site selected by the Aus-
tralian Parliament —often without going near it —
can’t agree to tell the same yarn as to the why of
their objection. This, for instance, is Richard
Teece, of Sydney, in Sydney Telegraph of
February 19 :
This is the sort of country in which the proposed
Federal capital of Dalgety will be situated. It is a barren,
wind-swept waste where the local growth of a cabbage
would be a curiosity. A much more desirable site is pro-
vided at Turnut. . . . The Yarrangobilly is a beautiful,
swift-flowing, constantly-running stream draining an ex-
clusively limestone country, and thus providing water of
superior quality to that of the granite-drained Snowy or
Cotter. . . . There is already good accommodation at
Tumut, so that legislative labors could be undertaken as
soon as Parliament House and the necessary adminis-
trative offices, which need only be of wood, were built.
At Dalgety a whole township would require to be built
before any work could be undertaken. But possibly
the advocacy of Dalgety is intended to serve other pur-
poses ; as I am not a politician, however, I am not com-
petent to discuss these.
Then compare that picture of the emptiness,
windiness and barrenness of Southern Mpnaro
with the shout of Joseph Caruuthers—then
N.S.W. State Premier—when he first refused to
even consider Dalgety as a possible capital (the
shout was published with great approval in
Sydney Telegraph of June 14, 1904, and it re-
ferred to exactly the same area that the Aus-
tralian Parliament asks for to-day)
It will include many considerable towns and a rich
district. . . . About 40,000 of our residents will be in-
cluded in the area. . . . We must lose our land-tax
revenues from the district annexed, which will be a good
round sum. True, we shall be relieved of the cost of
government of the area in question, BUT AS THEY ARE
OUR RICHEST DISTRICTS, and are now self-sustaining
practically, we have no desire to lose them. ... All the
roads, bridges, public schools, court houses, lands offices,
wharves, and public buildings of any and every kind
will be taken over with the area, etc.
There is a terrible discrepancy about these two
yarns, but it is significant that both these Sydney
CANBERRA.
This represents the business centre of Canberra (N.S.W.), and some of the principal in-
habitants. Canberra is the place that Slate Premier Wade (who really has nothing to do with
the selection of a capital, save as a private voter of the Commonwealth) wants to make the
political centre of all Australia.
men were against the site selected by the Aus-
tralian Parliament, and both declared against it
without seeing the place. Teeck objected
because the site is barren. Carruthers
objected on the ground that it is about the
most fertile place in N.S.W., and is such a
Garden of Eden that N.S.W. can’t afford to part
with it. 'J'eece was hostile because the proposed
Federal territory is a sterile, empty region where
there is no food grown for man or beast, and in
which, at the same time, there is liable to be such
a rush of settlement as will make the Snowy
River waters unusable (wherefore he recommends
Tumut as a fertile and populous region, where
there will never, by any chance, be any settlement
at all beside his pet river). Carruthers declared
the same Federal territory around Dalgety to be
occupied by 40,000 people—which Would be 44 to
the square mile, or a greater density of people
than is shown by the county of Northumberland,
where Newcastle and other mining centres a rem-
and infested by “many considerable towns,’’
and by “roads,' bridges, public schools,
court houses, lands offices, wharves, and pub-
lic buildings of any and every kind.’’ Car-
RUTHERS afterwards changed his view, and,
like Teece, became hostile to a capital beside the
Snowy River on account of the barrenness of
Monaro; but, later, he promised to extend the
Cooma railway to Bombala on account of the
extraordinary fertility of Monaro, so the Car-
ruthers position is very badly mixed. Then
Teece denounces Dalgety (population about 300),
which he didn’t visit, because “ a whole township
would require to be built there,” but at -Tumut
(population 1391) he sees all the ear-marks of a
ready-made capital, only- wanting for itSv.com-
pletion a Parliament House, and all the Govern-
ment offices, and a residence for the Governor-
General, and places for the Federal officials to
live in, and some sundries. In fact, it only wants
soles and uppers by-and-byetomake.it a first-class
ready-made pair of boots immediately. And mean-
while the same Sydney Telegraph which-devotes
a cordial leading article to Teece, the man who
complairis'that a whole township would have to be
built to turn Dalgety into a capital, has been for
mati-y months booming Canberra as a Federal
capital; and the township of Canberra consists of
one house in the business centre with about
three others scattered on the horizon. The
proposed Dalgety Federal site lies mainly in
the counties of Wallace and Wellesley, and the
latest N.S.W. statistics (1906) set forth that the
area sown with wheat in Wallace yielded eight
bushels to the acre, and the wheat area of Wel-
lesley 18 bushels, which make -a -rough average of
13 bushels. Tumut lies in Buccleuch and Wyn-
yard counties (Buccleuch, 13| bushels ; Wynyard,
12£; rough average also about 13 bushels).
There doesn’t seem so v«ry much to choose
between these relative degrees of fertility. Both
places must be served by branch railway lines,
though by carrying the Goulburn-Cooma line past
Dalgety and on through Gippsland to Bairnsdale,
it can be converted into a main line. Dalgety is
296 miles from Sydney, and its remoteness has
often been thrown up against it. Tumut is 322
miles from Sydney. Its remoteness would
doubtless be objected to if the Australian Parlia-
ment showed any sign of wanting it, but so long
as it‘isn’t wanted it remains a fairly eligible site
in the view of the anti-Federalist.
* * * *
Therefore the question of Dalgetv’s unpopular-
ity with the commercial Classes of Sydney remains
unexplainable upon any basis of honesty or fair-
mindedness. It must be remembered that the
opposition to it is purely a Sydney movement,
and finds no echo at all in the country districts of
N.S.W. Moreover, even in Sydney,-it is an arti-
ficial movement manufactured by the daily press,
the importers and a few lying parish politicians.
Sydney and its suburbs have always been domi-
nated to a great extent by the foreign importer,
and are consequently anti-Australian and anti-
Federal in a way that the rest of N.S.W. finds it
impossible to comprehend. They showed a small
majority against Federation even at thei final
referendum; and N.S.W.’s big Federal majority
came from the more patriotic country districts.
These country districts are more strongly Federal
now than they were in 1899, but the affluent
class in Sydney is still bitterly hostile to Aus-
tralian manufactures and Australian ideals, and
a slave to the foreign importing interest. To
that affluent class —which is also the class that
owns and runs the four Sydney dailies every-
thing of the slightest importance that the Austra-
lian Parliament has said or done or proposed to do,
since the first day when an Australian Parliament
existed, has been vilified, misrepresented, lied
about, denounced and described as insane
and ruinous. This attitude of the chroni-
cally anti-Federal city has become such an
obsession that even among those of its commer-
cial men who try to be fair-minded, and who
firmly believe that they are fair-minded, the
theory is still accepted that anything and every-
thing which the Australian Government does
must not only be a foolish and wicked proceeding,
but must naturally be a premeditated injury to
N.S.W. and an encroachment upon the Ma State’s
Rights. So it doesn’t matter whether the Dal-
gety district is denounced because it is so barren
that N.S.W. wouldn’t think.of offering it, or be-
cause it is so rich and fertile that N.S.W. couldn’t
think of parting with it —the effect is the same,
and it is the same city that speaks. If Dalgety had
not been the selection of the Australian Parlia-
ment "Richard Teece would probably have taken
the trouble to learn from an analytical chemist
that, because granite is insoluble, water gathered
in a granite country is about the purest that can
be found ; and he would probably have noticed
that a city planted in a granite country is one
with a splendid supply of building material, while
one planted in a limestone country isn’t. But to
the anti-Federalist, like Teece, even granite be-
comes rather an objection than otherwise when it
is to be found on the site which the Australian Par-
liament selected. And if the water supply of the
site which the Australian Parliament didn’t select
flowed through an ash-barrel, the ash-barrel would
probably rank with anti-Federafists like Teece
as a recommendation.
To the incurable variety of State Rights person,
the advantages of the proposed Snowy River site
are its disadvantages. The capital that he wants
is one which, by reason of its bad situation, its
want of water, or its general unsuitableness, can’t
grow to be a great, noble, prosperous city, and
overshadow his own State capital in size and
wealth. The unforgivable sin of the proposed
Dalgety site is the splendid water power,-which is
liable to make it the cheapest, and consequently
the greatest, manufacturing city of the Common-
wealth. Therefore does the incurable parochial-
ist pin his faith to dry, wretched, hopeless spots
like Canberra, where the Federal capital could
never be more than a sixth-rate town, and could
never hope to approach Sydney or Melbourne,
or to even rival Brisbane, Newcastle, Adelaide,
Bendigo, or Launceston. The Australian capihfl
would naturally be the centre of Federal
or Australian sentiment,, and- to the people
who seek to 'cultivate State or parish
sentiment rathef than the Australian article, it
seems better that the Federal city should be a
dull; unprogressive place of 20,000 inhabitants
than a noble metropolis with a population of a
million or so. The*anti-Australians who actually
formulate this idea may lie comparatively few,
but behind them is the weight of an unreasoning,
wooden-headed, parish-minded Tory party which
is against everything that the Australian Parlia-
ment is or does, because it has been told to be so
and has no mind of its own. It doesn’t know why
it objects to a Federal capital in practically the
only locality in N.S. W. where it is possible to build
a great ideal city. It is only the humble camp-
follower behind the army of cantankerousness and
disgust—trotting where it is told to trot, yelling
when it is told to yell, and objecting as it is told
to object. It isn’t necessary for a member of that
- crowd to-go and look at the Federal site before
pronbuncing it 'quite ufeefe&S. He is bbfltfd to say
it is useless in any case, and he can say it without
seeing the place he is talking about just as well as
any other way.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Dalgety.
testifies:—
I spent three weeks during the summer of 1904 at
Dalgety—the place R. Teece heard from someone the
other day was dog-poor and incapable of growing a
cabbage, and dangerous to human life, owing to its
chronic and awful tornado —and am forced to own it
didn’t impress me as the famine-stricken danger
spot Teece described. Nor did it when I passed
through the following winter going Jindabyne-wards
On the contrary, Dalgety and district struck me as
innocuous—even pleasing. The town has a couple of
good hotels, neither of which suggests the idea that it has
ever been blizzard-smitten to any extent. Up the hill
back of the main hostelry, are the usual stores, the post!
office, police station, and so on, which one is wont to
look for up country. None of these when I saw them
appeared to have been ruined recently, and the inhabi-
tants w’ere easy, confident men, and unafraid, or else were
consummate actors.
I left Sydney to pay my first visit to the Monaro, with
the temperature at 105° in the shade of the U.P.O. clock.
(N.B. —105° in the damp, steamy shade of Sydney and the
coast generally equals, say, 120° in the dry shade of inland
Australia.) The thermometer on the verandah of Quill's
Dalgety Hotel hovertd between 85°and 90° about midday,
and fell obligingly and deliciously towardsevening. A week
after my arrival a picnic party happened to deposit its
billy near where I was fishing, and some of the men spoke
to me. We turned out to have mutual friends, and
I was asked to visit at a near-by station. I started the
next morning on my 10-mile drive over the Downs
country, through which the Snowy River rushes.
The land did not look poor. Far from it. Away to
the far horizon rolled acre upon acre of shimmering grass.
Only the tree clumps, the fences, and the winding
willow-fringed river broke the emerald monotony. The
first homestead we passed (it is near the race-
course, and in sight of so much of the town
as appears over its shadowing hill-shoulder) did
not seem in an evil plight. One of the most useful-
looking orchards I have seen in years abutted the main
buildings ; also luxuriant kitchen and flower gardens
were visible from the road.
Arrived at the house where I was to put up, the absence
of ruin and desolation again became noticeable. My host
and I shot hares driven out of a cultivation paddock that
would have aroused grinding envy in the breast of a
Hawkesbury farmer. Later we wandered about a five-
acre orchard, and reached down as good a collection of
assorted fruit as could be bought in King-street, Sydney.
The evening meal consisted of foodstuffs of exclusively
local growth. There were vegetables—aye, even a sample
of the very cabbage in regard to which Teece expressed
himself as hopeless. The home-grown asparagus I still
recall with gratification.
Other neighboring station-homes I saw'during the week
that followed. They reposed all of them amidst gorgeous
shade trees and flower gardens ; they, all of them, grew
their own fruit, vegetables and the like, and not one but
cultivated wheat, barley or what not.
As to climate, it may be sheer perverseness, but the
Dalgetyite prefers his winter to his summer. At its
worst, the winter climate in those parts does not begin to
be cold as nine-tenths of the English-speaking peoples
understand the term. At its best it is the driest, most
bracing, healthiest winter climate conceivable. True,
gales occur there now and then ; so they do in Sydney,
London, and New' York ; likewise at places such as Davos
and St. Moritz, where European specialists send their
wealthy consumptive patients.
People like Teece are handicapped when they discuss
Dalgety', since (1) they have, for the most part, never been
there (Teece, for instance, did not, so far as can Jbe
gathered from his own account, approach within 16 miles
of the place he wrote of so disparagingly); and (2) they
are prejudiced hopelessly, in any case, as to this locality
by the State Rights creed inculcated by the Sydney
dailies. There is a type of Briton who believes that
Australians wear nothing but red shirts and revolvers,
and live by stealing each other’s improvement leases
between drinks. His local prototype is the Teece person-
lie whose press-feveijpd imagination constructs a wild
hair-raisingly perilous Dalgety (a death-trap, morgue and
mausoleum in one) ; and who shudders agonisedly
over his horrid conception at a distance of many miles,
and then hurries hoiqe in a demoralised state and com-
plains to the papers about it.
Crocodile Tears.
Four years ago Joseph Carruthers, State
Premier of N.S. W., was pegging away manfully
at his self-appointed job as the man who objected
to everything proposed by the Australian Parlia-
ment, and he fiercely declared that Dalgety and
its neighborhood represented the richest part of
N.S.W., and that his bleeding State couldn’t
think of parting with the only place it had where-
with to cover its nakedness, and giving it away to
anybody as a Federal capital. But that particular
lie or excuse was soon dropped, and for a long
time now the plea of the Cantankerous or Anti-
Federal Party, which objects to everything pro-
posed by the Australian Government, has been
that the poverty, barrenness and general misery
of Dalgety put it quite out of the question. Hence
such yarns as this by Richard Teece, of the
A.M.P. Society (Sydney Telegraph, 19/2/’08): —
This is the sort’ of country in which the proposed
Federal capital at Dalgety will be situated. It is a
barren, wind-swept waste, where the local growth of a
cabbage would be a curiosity.
Now, supposing these statements were true, how
is it possible to account for the frantic fight put
up by the anti-Federalists against the surrender
of this locality for Federal capital purposes? If
the Australian Government is content with a bit
of desert, why should Richard Teece and his
kind complain, and insist on giving awav good
land when good land isn't wanted? If tlfe Aus-
tralian Government is willing to tackle the job of
making the howling moor and waste blossom like
the rose, why should Teece and his friends inter-
fere? According to many hundred articles
in the S. M. Herald and Telegraph and
Star and Evening News, the Australian
Parliament has proved itself a bad lot,
and its treatment of N. S. Wales has been
shocking, not to say unprecedented, and
it has shown a constant tendency to high treason,
incivility, and procrastination, not to mention
devilishness and derision. So if that legislative
body has chosen, as the Sydney anti-Federalists
declare, to take sixpenn’orth of dreadful rock
from N.S. W. for a. capital, instead of depriving
that allegedly already torn and bleeding State of a
million pounds’ worth of Garden of Eden, what
possible excuse has Mr. Teece and his crowd tor
feeling hurt? According to the papers which
represent their view of the case, Victoria ana
South Australia have never shown any great out-
pouring of brotherly feeling towards N.S.W., or
supplied any reason why the Ma State should
rush out of its way and break its neck to suppi)
them with a beautiful capital and a Federal terri-
tory like Araby the Blest. If the accounts the
Telegraph, Herald, and Evening News have
given of the brutally selfish States 0
Victoria and S.A. are true, and if their
tales of how Victoria has conspired to
get the capital fixed at Dalgety for its own base
purposes are true, and if their yarns about tne
awfulness of that place are even half true, then iy
a wise dispensation of Providence a disreputab e
and malignant people have fallen in, and shou 0
be left in. Of course there may be another side
to the case. The professed desire that N.S.' •
should give away a rich stretch of land instead 0
a useless waste may be onlv another version of tn
tale of the white liar and. the unwise black
’ The unwise black digger had a diamond, and tne
white liar was moved to tears over the smallness
and uselessness of the article, and he wept aroun
the unwise black nigger till he got the diamon


away from him, and gave him instead of it a nice
large grindstone, or a big dinner plate, or some-
thing. Somehow, when the parochialists weep
about the barrenness and hopelessness of the
Federal capital site this paper is reminded of that
story. There seems to. be a resemblance.
Papua.
After a very brief experience, it is satisfactory to
note that the reorganisation of the Papuan
Government already shows signs of being a dis-
tinguished success. When the Australian Cabinet
decided, a year or so ago, to sweep away the
English-johnny Administration which had brought
the Possession to the edge of ruin, there were
prompt declarations from the Stinking Fish
party that it would be impossible to get an
Australian fit to be a Governor, and that it
would be best to put up with a con-
fessedly poor English Governor than attempt to
administer a Commonwealth possession with Com-
monwealth administrators. However, Prime
Minister Deakin took the plunge. An Australian,
Colonel Murray, who had already proved a con-
spicuous success as Chief Justice of Papua, was
made Governor. For the sake of economy, his
new administrative functions were combined with
his old judicial duties, and the commercial and
industrial work which the Governor used to do
was confided to ex-Senator Staniforth Smith,
another Australian. The plan seems to have
worked admirably. Governor Murray has re-
established confidence in the administration,
arid the white men express almost unanimous
confidence in his rule. Agricultural director
Smith is showing what an Australian hustler can
do when given the chance, and is laying the foun-
dations sure and deep for a series of great tropical
industries. The position of Papua is now full of
hope and promise, whereas a year ago it seemed
desperate. The Australian administration—if it
continues its present success—will, in a very few
years, show that White Australia can govern a
black dependency, and make a conspicuous success
of the work.

One-House Parliaments and a One-Horse
Paper.
In its issue of 14/2/’OB, Launceston (Tas.) Ex-
aminer threw this obscure and strangely ignorant
brick at the Australian unification movement :
In our late articles on the above subject we have
warned our readers against the centralising project
under the name of unification. Even those who propose
it admit it would not work without cutting up the Com-
monwealth into some thirty States, each with its one
House of Parliament and Lieutenant-Governor. As his-
tory shows that a one-House system is a one-horse system,
which has been discarded by every community which has
tried it, such a proposition by a journal claiming to be
smart only excites derision.
So the Examiner, out of the fathomless depths of
its ignorance, alleges that the system of govern-
ment by one House of Legislature “has been dis-
carded by every community which has tried it.’’
Yet a very little ordinary reading should be suffi-
cient to teach it better, and surely even the
Examiner can read. The communities inside
the British Empire where the system of
government by one House of Legislature prevails
include, to begin with, the Canadian provinces of
British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick,
Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Alberta, and
Saskatchewan. These all have elective Assem-
blies ; they cover by far the greatest part of
Canada —in fact, Nova Scotia and Quebec are the
only Canadian provinces which are still run on
the two-House system. So much is the one-
House system esteemed in Canada that when the
new provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were
established in 1905, no one dreamed of saddling
them with the silly incubus of an Upper Cham-
ber. Other British possessions that struggle along
with one House of Legislature—elective, or
partly nominee, or wholly nominee—are the Yukon
Territory, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands,
India as a whole, likewise its individual provinces,
Egypt, Jamaica, Trinidad, Ceylon, Cyprus,
Malta, and a lot of sundries. In Ger-
many, Anhalt, Brunswick, Lippe, the two
Mecklenburgs, Oldenburg, Reuss, baxe-
Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Weimar,
Schaumburg-Lippe, Waldeck, Schwartzburg-
Rudolstadt, Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, and Schwartz-
burg-Sondershausen are a few states which travel
on the one-House principle. (Saxe-Weimar boasts
the first liberal constitution ever granted in
Germany, and its solitary House of Parliament
has run things for 92 years.) Greece also gets
through with one House, likewise Finland, Costa
Rica, Honduras, and some other places that the
Examiner plainly never heard of. Further, the
Orange Free State had a Legislature of one House
until its independence was destroyed a few years
ago. By comparison with the other States,
Tasmania puts up a poor record in the way of
education, and the Examiner doesn t seem of
much use in the way of shoving it up the steep
road that leads unto the City of Information. Ihe
Bulletin bases its theory that one-House Legisla-
tures are advisable, especially as regards the States,
on the grounds: (1) that the abolition of the
Upper Houses would save money ; (2) that it
would save time, it being a much simpler proceed-
ing to read a Bill thrice than six times; and (3)
that the unicameral system has been tried formally
years in many lands, and experience has shown no
reason against it. On the other side of the case
the Launceston Examiner can only advance a
sample of cheerful, confident, off-hand ignorance
that is a pathetic reflection on the insufficiency ot
the school system in its island.

Trouble on a State Bank’s Doorstep.
The men who are running the Advances to Settlers
Department of the N.S.W. Government Savings
Bank told the public the other day that the agent
was putting his finger in the pie, and they warned
the borrowing public that the finger was useless
and unnecessary, and possibly it wasn t clean as
well. Thereupon A. H. Griffith, M.L. A., writes
to say that the agent shouldn’t be necessary, but
is, because the Advances to Settlers Department
—hereinafter called the State Bank for short -is
already hobbled with red tape, and needs push-
ing and shoving ; consequently Griffith, M. L. A.,
is in the business himself, and has a finger for hire
on the basis of 1 percent, commission when the
loan comes off. It is horribly bad news. The
enemies of a State Bank always have said, first
and foremost, that it wyuld be subject to political
pressure—that the M.P. would make his own
position good by unloading all the deadbeats
and derelicts on to the State Bank’s doormat
They have pointed out that the State Bank worild
he a Government concern, that its officers woma
be subject to Parliament, and they have asked
whether those officers could all be expected to do
the hard, cold business thing with members ot
Parliament looking in and recommending clieflts
l and constituents for loans, etc. Now, as.if to give
point to that objection, here is Arthur Griffith,
M.L.A., a member of the Labor Party, and one
■ who ought to lie particularly interested in making
a success of this State Bank experiment, confessing
that he is acting as an agent, and that he is pecu-
niarily interested in getting loans put through.
Griffith s defence, of course, will be that he is
interested in making a success of the State Bank
-so interested that he is getting loans for people
who would otherwise go to private banks, because
ot the State Bank’s delays. But Griffith’s
obvious duty is, not to make money out of, the
delays,_ and acquire a financial interest in per-
petuating them, but to set to work to secure the
removal of the difficulties which he says now
exist. Anyhow, the public is indebted to
him for his frank confession. The prac-
tical question now is : What is to be done
about it ? Nothing is surer than that the agent
a *id middleman must be absolutely shut out of
the bank. More than that, even the appearance
of these influences must be shutout. If it isn’t,
then the public will not trust the bank with its
money. Alex. Mclntosh, the manager—he who,
as general manager of the Bank of New Zealand,
did such fine work in pulling that concern out of
the mud—has taken the first step, in announcing
that the agent is to a prospective client.
The second step ought to be the removal of any
unnecessary red-tape, and no man ought to be a
better judge of red-tape than Mclntosh. And, if
the bank is forced to it, a third step may be taken
—the refusal of all applications in which agents
and middlemen are interested.
The Nigger Asserts Himself.
An event, probably unique in the history of the
P. and O. service, happened last week. The Lascars
of the Mooltan uprose in revolt, and deliberately
assaulted the chief officer while in the execution
of his duty. He was rescued from them with
some trouble, else he might have been dead as well
as assaulted. The incident is a striking sign of the
period. There was a time, not long since, when
the idea that a common P. and O. Lascar should
give way to anger against his white boss under
any circumstances whatsoever would have seemed
grotesque. The Lascar was where he was owing
mainly to his infinite capacity for taking kicks. Tbe
serang or slave-driver who got the Lascar his billet
with the co. in the first place, would have swooned
at the idea of one of him raising sacrilegious hands
against a white man—it being the first task of the
capable serang to instil into his nigger subor-
dinates the view that the white (and above all the
white officer) was of a different clay from the black.
And for years that view has obtained, and the
Lascar employee has remained one of the most
humble employees on earth. It is the Anglo-Jap
alliance, and the happenings in connection there-
with, ’ that have changed things so pain-
fully. The Indian colored person sees no
difference between himself and any other
colored person. He reckons that if a Jap nigger
is as good as a white man, a Lascar nigger ought
to be the same. Hardly a trip nowadays but he
sees Japs playing cards in the smoking-room
with British soldiers, flirting on deck with British
maidens, waited on and valeted by British ser-
vants.' And when he goes on shore, the Lascar
always has a Babu friend to read him the pro-Jap
slush that the pr'o-nigger British papers delight
to la'dlAbut, and' another 'Babu friend to give a
reason for it all—the only reason that appeals
to the Asiatic mind — viz., that the white is
civil to the yellow because he is afraid to be other-
wise. The Mooltan episode is significant as typi-
f.ymg what is going on wherever the infrequent
white Britisher lives among many blacks. Not
brute force, but race-prestige has stood to the
white administrator in the ' past. What most
handicaps him to-day, whether he be administrat-
ing aboard a mailship among 50 blacks or in an
Indian province among 5,000,000, is the policy of
nigger alliance which Britain has adopted during
the last decade.
The Manufacturer who Wants All the
Protection.
There are still a few manufacturers who haven’t
yet been broken of the bad old idea, carefully
fostered by the importers’ papers, that the Com-
monwealth’s Protective policy is intended to
apply to themselves solely, and not to their
employees as well. The other day, the manager
of a Melbourne softgoods factory—a firm that
notoriously can never get employees as long as
other firms have vacancies—complained to. the
papers of the great dearth of white-workers, owing,
he said, to the restriction put upon the employ-
ment of improvers and apprentices. Of course,
he was merely talking at large, in the fashion
customary with the average fatman ; but he was
presently informed that the Factories Act allows
him two improvers to every adult (surely enough
to keep the supply of journey women going !) and
as many apprentices as he has a mind to have or can
get—providing he binds them and teaches them
the trade. He hadn’t the grace to apologise for
his false statement, but weakly shuffled away
with the remark that “ the binding of apprentices
is most unsatisfactory when manufacturing is
carried on on an extensive scale.” Of course it is
“most unsatisfactory” in the same way that
locks are “most unsatisfactory” to W. Sikes.
For, if a man feels that way, it pays him better to
employ the improver, teach her just enough to
make her profitable to a specialising employer,
and give her no further instruction whatever.
But it happens that the chief object aimed at
when Parliament protected that industry, and
imposed restrictions on the number of improvers,
was that juvenile workers should have openings
for their energies and abilities, and should be
taught their trades properly —not that the manu-
facturer should pocket all the profit he could
without regard to the advantage of his employees
and the community in general. As for the
“binding of apprentices being unsatisfactory,”
another Melbourne white-work manufacturer, also
on an extensive scale, finds his bound apprentices
so satisfactory that he lately summoned two
absconding damsels to court and had them ordered
to return and complete their indentures. He was
paying them the legal minimum wage, but he
had taught them so thoroughly that when they
“levanted” they had no difficulty in obtaining
double their wages in another factory. The
apprentice, properly taught, is profitable all right;
yet there is still a protected manufacturer here
and there who looks back with regret to the time
when he could get unlimited “improvers,” at
nothing a week the first six months and the sack
thereafter.

Australia and. the Asiatic.
The good fairies who presided at Australia’s birth
and gave the newest of the nations many great
. gifts have, not forsaken their favorite since. No
community has ever been so blessed with peace or
with material prosperity ; and no people has ever
been given such opportunities and warnings to
prepare to guard that peace and prosperity. To
many nations the call has come of a sudden to
arm and face a foe, falling as it were from the sky,
as Pizarro burst on the Peruvians. To Aus-
tralia has been granted ample forewarning
of its future perils ; and the warnings have
been repeated again and yet again, as if
Fate were resolved that Australia must be
somehow urged to its salvation. The latest warn-
ing is as yet hardly a week old. Answering a
request that the British Government should seek
to arrange with “the Colonies” some basis of
agreement for dealing with Asiatic immigration,
Lord Elgin, for the Government—
undertook to use the first opportunity to consider the
question, either by conference or some more diplomatic
method ; but the present moment was inopportune.
The request was significant; the reply equally so-
It, in effect, amounts to a declaration that the
party of which Elgin is a member only awaits an
opportunity to raise the whole question of Asiatic
immigration restriction ; the other party does not
believe in waiting at all. British diplomacy finds
itself to-day continually embarrassed by this
Asiatic question. The Empire is to an extent
confided to Asiatic guardianship. The Anglo-
.Tapanese alliauce makes Japan the full
national partner of England. Australian legis-
lation makes Japan, in common with other
Asiatic countries, a banned land whose in-
habitants may not mix their blood with ours.
The two facts must one day collide. It is im-
possible to imagine a very long continuance of a
position where the head of the house relies for
support on a friend whom his children .refuse to
recognise. As in the melodramatic situation, wnen
the doting father is asked to give his daughter’s
hand to the loathly suitor who holds a mortgage—
and the interest is overdue—on the ancestral
estates, so stand Australia, Great Britain and
Japan to-day. A crisis must result. There are
many possible outcomes, and every one means
disaster if Australia persists in remaining defence- (
less, a dependent instead of a valuable friend in
the’audit of diplomacy. And this fact is being'
impressed upon Australia year after year, month
after month. Indeed, hardly a week passes with-
out some sort of a warning. If all the warnings
are persistently disregarded, it will be too much
to expect that the just historian of the future will
have a sympathetic sigh for the fate of White
Australia. His verdict must be: “It served
them right.”
Arbitration and the Alternative.
By promising Arbitration, or something like it,
or by making concessions, the employers of
N S. Wales have managed to smother the prin-
cipal of the strikes raging last week. This week
they are faced with another crop of industrial dis-
turbances, and yet another looms in the distance,
and it is made each day increasingly clear that
the alternative to an effective scheme of
industrial arbitration will be a great series of
strikes inflicting a staggering blow on the
growing prosperity of the State. Nor will
that result be in any way forfended by the
substitution for an Arbitration Court of a
Wa°es Board system. The Wages Board is effect-
ive enough in dealing with sweating in factory
industries; in Victoria such Boards have raised
the standard up to a living rate in many callings.
But when great industries, such as raining,
employing: vast bodies of workers, whose disputes
with their employers ate often not on matters of
wages at all, come to be considered, Wages
Boards would be ridiculously ineffective.
They would not have the horse-power for
the job. When the existing N.S.W. Arbitration
Act comes to he examined in detail, it is
astonishing to find how little amendment it needs
to make it effective. Except for some provisions
to strengthen its power in one or two directions
and to make it more accessible, it needs no real
change. Where change is more needed is in
devising some means of dealing with the an-
tagonistic forces to the Act, particularly the Tory
press which has treated the Court with organised
contempt. It is not possible to establish an
absolute, unappealable court; but it should be
possible to protect Arbitration Court decisions in
some measure from the N.S.W. Supreme Court
(whose Chief Justice has shown savage and public
contempt for its dignity), and from the High
Court, which, The Bulletin regrets to record,
has taken an attitude against industrial arbitra-
tion deeply tinged with class prejudice, and de-
plorably antagonistic to the public interests.
Protect the N.S.W. Arbitration Court against
press antagonism ; give it some better protection
against factious appeals, and it will be as effective
a machine as the Maoriland Act which has pre-
vented strikes for 13 years.
The Shame and Disgrace of N.S.W.’s House
of Living Death.
Interest in Liverpool (N.S.W.) Tubercle Farm
was again revived last week. A leading Sydney
medico was moved by the horrors he saw at the
institution into making scathing comments about
it in the press. Thereupon the S. M. Herald
sent a man out to inspect the microbe hatchery,
and here are a few of the Herald’s resulting
remarks: —
The Liverpool Asylum, which dates back as far as 1825,
has at the present time 674 inmates, but often there are
as many as 1000 on the roll. . . .
Overcrowding takes place not only in dormitories
where the inmates are well, but also in wards that con-
tain patients in every stage of consumption. There are
four wards used by consumptive patients; each’ward is
50ft. by 45ft., with a ceiling 14ft. high. There are 40
beds in each of these wards. Every bed in two of the
wards was occupied, and most of the beds in the other
wards were also in occupation. It was dinner time;
those who were able to get up were dining in the ward
along with the bed-ridden patients. In fact, the men
were huddled together in a fashion the very opposite to
what experts in the cure of consumption recommend. . . .
One man said : “ The overcrowding is killing me fast.
The air at night is stifling. Forty of us sleep in this
room. No wonder so many die.” . . .
Another said : “ Dr. Beattie ordered me two ounces of
liquor daily. Mr. Brodie came along and said I was only
to get one ounce.”
Another patient, who carries out the work of dresser
of wounds in the cancer hospital—a most revolting busi-
ness, for which he was paid Is. a day—complained bitterly
that his wages had been reduced to 9d.
Our representative found fault with the dirty condition
of the walls of the staircases, etc., and of certain windows,
and the attention of an attendant was drawn to the
matter. The reply was that inmates who were to do
these jobs, for which they used to get 2d. and 3d. per
day, had had their pay stopped, and most of them had,
in consequence, left the institution, and there was no one
remaining to do the work. One window had not been
cleaned for two years. . . .
And so on—a beautiful story of up-to-date sanita-
tion and scientific treatment of disease. A while
back Wade, of N.S.W., and Bent, of Victoria,
held close confabulation together about the repeal
of the N.S.W. stamp duties on bills of exchange—
an action which Bent claims is injuring his State
(where stamp duties still exist), by enticing
Victorian business to N.S.W. Wade explained
that he had “a big surplus,” and he really didn’t
know what to do with it, unless he “lightened
some of the burdens ” of the fat Sydney merchants
by repealing the stamp duties. Well, it is now
partly explained, anyway, how Wade’s surplus
was achieved—by stopping the few paltry pence
that once went to “ lighten some of the burdens ”
and cheer the last wretched days of aged con-
sumptives, of venerable dressers of cancer sores,
and by patriarchal cleaners of tubercle-laden
staircases and windows. Wade really ought to
be proud of that surplus.
♦
Listen to the financial roar of T. Bent from Mel-
bourne : 1
I Lave made a start in the direction of paying off abso-
lutely the loans as they mature. I am paying off half a
million of the loan that falls due five weeks hence. I
think that, wherever the State can manage it, it should
at least reduce the amount to be converted.
Such remarks as that make The Bulletin
feel inclined to go out every now and
then and buy Bent a new hat. There are
other statesmen in other States who are
doing something at straightening the finances,
but Bent is the only one who regards the reduc-
tion of the public debt as such a notable virtue
that he roars about it with his best Sunday roar.
He regards it as his pride and glory, and by using
his Sunday roar upon the subject he advertises it
as the first duty of a Premier to reduce the public
debt. He shoves the matter into the forefront of
politips, and accustoms the people to expect that
future Premiers will follow in the same track.
Every time Bent waves his half-million repay-
ment madly round his head, and fills the air with
crackers, and discords, and flying snakes, he makes
it harder for the next Premier to wander back on
to the old loan track. Australia can’t be taught
too thoroughly that the . loftiest virtue, a
Premier can possess is the virtue which
makes him stop borrowing and start repaying;
and if Bent’s voice gives out with talking on the
subject, Victoria should hire a Stipendiary
Roarer to take up the parable for him. A flushed,
perspiring Bent, with smoke rising from his
excited head, may not be all that could be desired
as an art spectacle, but as a non-borrowing
spectacle he is fairly right so far.

“ Binnacle ” : Trouble is brewing between the
North Coast s.s. Company and its officers. With
practically a monopoly of the trade in its district,
the N. C. Co. has its officers very much fit its
mercy. Of recent years men with deep-sea
tickets have forfeited good prospects in order to
join the North Coast line, with the idea of haying
a taste of family life. To-day most of them assert
that they see less of their families now that they
are on the coast than when on inter-State boats.
Thev allege that 120 hours per week is an ordi-
nary thing, knd often the pay of a chief officer
comes to less than the earnings of some of the
crew, as bis official dignity prevents the co. offering
him overtime money. Recently Justice O Connor
ordered increases in the pay of officers on inter-
state steamers, and made some much-needed
restrictions as to the hours of work while in port.
This Federal award, however, does not affect the
North Coast Co:, which is a one-State affair, yet
in the coastal trade such an award is more needed
than anywhere else. The only chance of a rest
that the officers get is when their vessels are bar
bound in some remote river. Their complaint is
that the ships discharge and reload again before
the officers have time to get home to kiss their
kiddies, and hurry away under a torrent of com-
plaints’ from the “office” about their long
stay in port. Then while the officers’ duties
are as anxious and responsible as those on
an inter-State boat, they are looked upon
by their confreres on, Say the Kvarra, just as they
themselves look on the mates of a mere tug. It

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Commonwealth, the mother, bends over all
the land,
And, clarion-voiced with anger, flings forth the
stern command :
“Ye stiff-necked, stubborn people, throw down
your greed-gods; then,
Like strong, true nation-builders, go forth and
bring me men.
“ One worship, and one only, is worthy of a race.
And ev’ry heart and hearthstone should be its
altar-place ;
Your Native Land, oh, people ! seek, seek my
shrine, nor turn
Till fires of patriotism like incense in you burn.
“ But, ere you kneel, go, ruthless, and build a
sacrifice
Of all your dainty playthings of indolence and
vice;
Yea, heap them for the burning, nor desecrate my
shrine
With lassitude of lust, nor with the wantonness
of wine.
“Three million-miled dominion of sea-girt
opulence !
What have you done, oh, people! to guard me
from offence ?
What have you done but nourish the sloth that
aye defers
And sate yourselves with favors of leering usurers ?
“My seaboards fill with envy full many a foreign
foe;
Where are the warrior legions to guard me from
the blow ?
Where? In your smiling cities, where Pleasure
stands for Right,
And Mother Doorstep murders my children night
by night ?
“Where? In that fringe of white men whose
roadways hug the sea ?
Lo, North and West the Yellow and Brown their
masters be !
Where ? In the smiling bush-lands ? But wealth
has written there
Death warrants for your yeomen ten thousand
acres square.
“ Three-million-miled dominion ! Oh, sons and
daughters mine,
This is no time for drinking deep draughts of
dreamy wine,
No time for idly courting, where borrowed beds
are piled,
The luxury and license that scorns to bear a child.
“My weakness is your weakness; come, throw
your dolls aside;
My children must be nurtured —they are the
nation’s pride;
My lands must be unshackled till every mile can
boast
A strong, true, white defender to guard my golden
coast.
“ Then swiftly, oh, my people ! here to mine altar
turn
Till fires of patriotism like incense in you burn,
Till, narrow notions conquered, you grip the wider
ken
And feed my growth with maidens and guard my
shores with men.”

co. that their united voice is heard while other
voices are smothered in the din of escaping steam.
The Bulletin has repeatedly, though mostly in a
hopeless manner, urged that clerks should take
their economic salvation into their own hands by
forming a union ; and at last the union has
arrived, ijie other day the United Clerks Union
of N.S.W. held its second meeting, and showed
itself how it was growing. Its membership,
although propaganda work had hardly com-
menced, had doubled since the initial meeting.
Some of the strongest unions have had less pro-
mising beginnings. And it is “up to” all clerks
of intelligence and energy to see that the promise
is borne out by enrolling themselves and in-
ducing their unconvinced friends to do likewise.
There is no class that so urgently needs a union
and an Arbitration Court and a Wages Board
as that of the clerical worker; and there is no
class that is more difficult to organise. It is for
this reason (over and above the arguments of their
own reason) that every clerk who prides himself
on a little backbone should rush to unite himself
to other specimens of spine to make strong the
united skeleton of clerkdom, so that in due course
the flesh of salary may grow thereon and make it
fat. The new combination can be heard of at the
Sydney Trades Hall, which is the best address
it could have.
From a recent visitor to Thursday Island : — •
The first sight which greets the eye of a visitor to
Thursday Island is a huge fleet of deserted pearling
luggers lying at anchor. The sole industry of this dreary
and barren settlement is in a slate of paralysis, for the
Japs, who practically run the show, are on strike ; and
owing to a big slump occasioned through recent Yankee
failures, their nominal white masters cannot meet their
demands.
Meanwhile the Jap, whose earnings range from £2OO to
£SOO per annum, squats complacently on the kerbstone,
patiently but confidently awaiting the capitulation of
the few whites who have yfet an interest in the concern.
Should his inclinations move him abroad, perchance on
his way to the post-office for the purpose of remitting his
gold to his own country—for he spends not a cent here,
and imports his food from Japan—it is the despised
white wl*o must needs offer him precedence on the
ifootpath. The Asiatic has gradually but none
■the less effectively insinuated himself into trade. He
owns most of the stores. His local influence is now
almost paramount, so much so that Burns, Philp and
Co., the shipping monopolists of the Pacific, have, it is said,
been called upon to sack a manager or two who have
failed to please the Monkey.
The garrison of the northern outpost of the Common-
wealth consists of about 60 men ; the total population of
Thursday Island is about 1300, of whom some 850 belong
to the nation which would be our most probable op-
ponent in the event of war —a curious commentary on
our boasted White-Australia policy.
If the pearling trade (which, after all, is of little benefit
to anybody in particular, other than the divers) cannot
float without Asiatic labor, far better to seize the oppor-
tunity and let it die than assist in perpetuating a condi-
tion of things which is altogether antagonistic to the in-
terests of the Commonwealth, and which may prove a
source of no little danger in the future. The most effectual
and a very simple method of dealing with the difficulty
is to prohibit the further indenture of Asiatics, and de-
port those who are here when their time is up.
The Commonwealth Conferenceof Health Officers,
summoned to consider the question whether the
Danysz microbe should be disseminated on the
mainland, has reported “No.” The Conference
concludes that the microbe is not different from
that which originates a rabbit disease already in
Australia, and that there is no hope of it proving
■efficacious in checking the rabbit pest. This
should be conclusive, but it isn’t. The press bar-
rackers for the Danysz syndicate still clamor
that it should be given a trial, though it is
pronounced to be useless, and Sydney Telegraph
hints at making a “State rights” matter of the
freedom of N.S.W. to disseminate what microbes
it darned well pleases. It is impossible to find a
reason for all this proposed fuss and expense,
unless The Bulletin’s theory is accepted, that the
people at the back of the business really aim not
so much at the rabbit as at the rabbit-trapping
business. Abolish rabbit-trapping, and bush
wages would drop heavily.

ONE of Carruthers’ last election tricks is causing
trouble. Partly because N. S. Wales sells a
million pounds’ worth of land a year, and grabs
the proceeds, and calls it revenue, and partly
because it borrows between one and a half and
two millions and spends a lot of it on things that
ought to be paid for out of revenue, Ma State has
lately been showing a surplus. Carruthers, who
represented that this bogus surplus was due to his
great capacity, undertook to chop off “unneces-
sary” taxes if the electors would give him another
majority; and, on Carruthers’ retirement, Wade
carried out the promise to some extent. Now
Victoria finds that, as its traders have to pay
stamp duties and those of N.S.W. don’t, Victoria
is hobbled ; and Bent is beginning to roar about
it, and says he is going to chop off taxes, too, to
make things even. But in a contest of that sort,
Vic. and N. S. Wales don’t start off the
same mark, because Vic. hasn’t any million-
a-year of land to sell, and for a while back it
has given up the pawning habit. Still there
is no telling what one dishonest trader may not
force another into—and in this matter of treating
land-sales money as revenue, dishonesty is the one
word that meets the situation. The whole row
makes it quite clear that Federation in its present
form isn’t sufficient to stop one State from cutting
another State’s throat ; and, when Australia
fully wakes up to that fact, something better and
fuller than the present form of Federation won’t
be long in coming.

Catts, M.H.R. (who personally favors Lyndhurst
as the site of the Federal capital), to a Quean-
beyan (N.S.W.) press interviewer :
“Do you think there is any likelihood of the decision
in favor of Dalgety being reversed?”
“I do not think so. Dalgety was deliberately chosen
by a majority of both the Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives, after exhaustive enquiry. Both Mr. Reid and
Mr. Watson expressed themselves as prepared to accept
the decision loyally as the best compromise which could
be obtained. We are a little inclined in N.S.W. to think
that we constitute Australia, and that our ideas must be
accepted. As a matter of fact the N.S.W. members are a
hopeless minority in both Federal Houses. We may
think that a certain site has no merit, but if a majority
of members from the other States think and vote other-
wise, our protests are like so much stage thunder. We
may not like Dalgety, but, after exhausting our rights
of speech and voting in the Federal Houses, we
must, as loyal Australians, abide by the decision
of the majority, arrived at in a constitutional manner.
There are some reasons urged in favor of Dalgety, by
representatives of some of the other States, which cannot
be altogether ignored. Dalgety is situated in the south-
eastern corner of New South Wales. The Federal Parlia-
ments have asked for 30 miles square, or 900
square miles of country, and desire that the corner of the
State referred to should become Federal territory. This,
they claim, would give them a port at Twofold Bay, with
an independent entrance from the ocean. There would
also be an entrance from another State (Victoria). Com-
munication is a very important factor. These gentlemen
referred to see trouble ahead if the Federal City were
situated inland so far that access depended upon
railway communication on all sides through the terri-
tory of a single State. Suppose a site were
chosen in the centre of New South Wales, and the question
of railway communication became paramount. The
Commonwealth may desire one route, the State another.
The Commonwealth may view the strategic position as of
most importance, the State may wish agricultural lands
opened up, and take the commercial view point. Under
such circumstances, there are those who apprehend
trouble, and look upon the accessibility of Dalgety from
the ocean and through a second State with favor on that
account. They think that a Carruthers or a Wade may
refuse land for railway construction, as they are now try-
ing to block the handing over of the capital site territory
asked for by a majority of both Houses of the Federal
Parliament. We may not share these views, but there
are members from other States who hold them very
strongly."

The demand made in N.S.W. for a Government
audit of the accounts of all charitable bodies sub-
sidised by the State or by public subscription
should apply to every part of Australia ; still a
beginning must be made somewhere, and N.S.W.
is a fairly good place to start with. There are in
existence in Sydney piles of documents to prove
the necessity for strict Government supervision
over the art and mystery of professional and
amateur philanthropy. For instance, there
existed a few years ago a certain—or
uncertain —Unemployed Relief Committee, with
the Mayor of Sydney at its head. At one
meeting it was shown that the expenditure was
£66 Bs. lid. The Mayor insisted on particulars,
and it was revealed that the destitute had received
just £l7. Some items ran : Commission for col-
lectors, £l2 Os. lOd. ; meals for collectors, £9 145.;
secretary’s salary, £6 13s. 4d. ; salary for active
service, £7 12s. 6d. ; rent of office, £4 4s. ; print-
ing and sundries, £9 13s. 3d. The Mayor’s com-
ments, which were unpleasant, burst up the
organisation, or it might, perhaps, to-day be a
settled and lucrative means of livelihood for
quite an army of philanthropists. There have
been institutions as bad, and institutions that
were even worse. The dead concerns may not be
worth overhauling, but a rigid and constant over-
haul of the live ones might supply interesting
reading.

A public-spirited person lately wrote to Premier
Bent pointing out that an estate at Foster, in
Gippsland, which had just been sold for £l2 per
acre, was valued for rating purposes at £3 15s.
per acre. Bent bellowed fiercely on getting the
information, and promised to introduce next
session a Land Valuation Bill, which would pro-
vide for State valuers. He would call this his
Domesday Book, he said, and it would
“straighten things out.” He knew, he added,
that for years the valuations in most Victorian
shires have been ridiculously low—ranging from a
quarter to half their proper figure. And just
as Bent knows what is done in the country,
he knows also that the valuations in
the cities are well up to their real figure, and
that the rates range up to 2s. 4d. in Brunswick
and Footscray. That is to say, he knows that
while the country landowner taxes himself muni-
cipally at about 4d. in the £, the Footscray and
Brunswick workers dip in their pockets to the
extent of 2s. 4d. in the £l. Yet, in the face of
this knowledge, Bent last session not only in-
creased the municipal subsidy (to these country
shires) from £50,000 to £lOO,OOO, largely at the
cost of the burdened city workers, but also handed
them a so-called road grant of £90,000, also largely
at the cost of the heavily-taxed city workers.
Bent knows all these facts, but instead of strenu-
ously kicking the cheeky country cadgers, he
actually handed them a shilling in place of the
sixpence they asked for ; and then he valorously
talks about a Land Valuation Bill, knowing all
the while that the House of Fat Landlords won’t
let him pass it.

That idol of the Sydney Telegraph, the primary
producer, .came out strong last week. During
the brief spell of drought the dairy farmer doubled
his prices, because he had, he said, to buy fodder
for his herds. Then came the rain, and the grass
came hp like a hundred million edition of Jonah’s
mushroom, and the dairy farmer showed no in-
clination to lower his prices, although the neces-
sity for buying fodder had gone. In Sydney, the
City Council began to discuss the advisability of
municipalising the milk supply, and the frightful
price of Is. per gallon, paid to the producers
whose cattle were almost knee deep in grass,
was a good argument in favor of the idea.
So the big distributing companies reduced
the price to the public by one-third and
cut down the dairy farmer to 6d. Now
the primary cow-man talks of forming a union, or
a combine, and going on strike, and depriving
the city of all milk till the distributing companies
agree to pay at the rate of Bd. per gallon from
February 10. When the coal-miner threatens to
go on strike because he is underpaid it is an out-
rage which calls for all sorts of sudden and drastic
action on the part of the Government. When a
gang of dairy-farmers, to enforce famine prices in
time of plenty, propose to cut off the capital’s
milk supply, and thereby bring about the deaths
of a few thousand children, the same blessed
papers don’t even denounce the proposal.
When the Essendon and Flemington (Vic),
councils handed .over the use of their streets to
the North Melbourne Electric Tram Co., they
stipulated that the employees should be worked
the same hours and be paid the same wages as the
employees of the Melbourne Tram Co. It wasn’t
much of a condition to make in consideration of
what the fool councils gave away ; but, little as
it was, the Essendon co. declines to keep it. The
big Melbourne co., smelling trouble from Parlia-
ment, recently, to escape a worse disaster, re-
duced its hours for gripmen and conductors from
60 to 54 per week ; but the Essendon co. calmly
claims that the agreement “inferred” the big
co.’s wages and hours at the time when the
paper was signed. Of course if that had been so,
the said wages and hours would have been men-
tioned ; it was the probability of increased wages
and shorter hours that made the councils take the
big co.’s rates as a standard. The agreement also
stipulates the payment of time-and-a-quarter for
every hour worked over 60 per week. But the
co. has a strong objection to paying extra
rates; so if a man works, say, 70 hours
on a busy week when the weather is fine,
the co. cuts him down to 50 hours a week
later on when things are slack, and calls
the account square. Which it isn’t, for to give a
man an hour off at, say, Is. to make up for an
hour worked extra at Is. 3d. is selling him a shilling
for fifteenpence. There are other items about
the co.’s record that the councils cordially dis-
approve of. Yet, unfortunately, all this trouble
never seems to teach these local bodies wisdom.
Melbourne, Bendigo, Ballarat, Coburg, Northcote,
Caulfield, Essendon —all have had more or less
unpleasantness with the lessees of their lines ; and
still Malvern and Prahran want to hand their
prospective tramline over to the usual private
shindykit.

Mart Gilmore gives her point of view as to
“Conscription ”: —
Will some of these foolish people who are making such
a fuss about conscription and its “ un-Britishness ” kindly
explain what is the difference between conscription and
compulsory education, payment of taxes, stamp duties,
rule of the road, and all the other kind of compulsions
the Briton is subject to?
I have seen something of conscription in S. America,
and I cannot say that it hurt any. The lads drilled at
school (at least some of them), the young men drilled
once a week in their respective towns, villages and settle-
ments, and (once in three years, I think) spent six weeks
in tents at Curumulan, outside Buenos Aires, learning
the art of camping out, marching, packing up in a hurry,
and several other things. We travelled up the coast with
about 150 young Welshmen from Chubut, who looked
upon the thing as a holiday and rather a good outing,
in which much was seen, done, and learned, and little
spent.
It may be remembered the Chubutans and the Govern-
ment had words, and many of the former went, after 50
years’ settlement, to S. Africa. But the cause of the
quarrel was not conscription. It was the drill on Sunday,
when the Calvinistic little Welshmen thought they ought
to be at church. .
If we must have soldiers, why make distinction
between rich and poor (which voluntary service just
about amounts to)? If we must defend our country, why
should my son fight for another woman’s safety and hers
stand out? If we must have war, why should we have to
enter upon it with trained men having to bear the
burden of the untrained, who, at the last minute, would
surely want to join—if not cowards altogether?
Either it is a decent and a creditable thing to be a
soldier, and ready to take up arms for one’s country, or
it is not. If it be not, let us do away with soldiers alto-
gether. If it be the other way, then let us have no class
distinctions, but an army that includes all our sons.
A system of training beginning with school and ending
with manhood would lessen the strain of severe training,
should need for such arise, and might very easily be made
to settle the larrikin and the prison question—by keeping
undesirables always at if. or till they showed themselves
honest and decent citizens.

Weddell’s annual meat figures arrive from
Europe to throw a sidelight on the Danysz
microbe controversy. In the last two years the
beef imported into Britain from Australia works
out at 8237 tons. In the same time the frozen
Australian rabbits imported into the same cold,
hungry country turned the weighbridge at 59,157
tons. J. Bull takes more Australian rabbit in a
day than he takes of Australian beef in a week ;
in 1906 he took more rabbit than sheep, and in
1904 he took twice as much rabbit as sheep. It isn’t
an argument in favor of letting mutton and sheep
slide, of course ; but it is a mighty strong argument
against knocking out the rabbit-export business
unless it can be proved right up to the hilt that the
sheep and mutton business is going to be im-
proved enough to make up for the loss. Also, for
a start, the Danysz people will have to prove that
their process can knock out more than 59,157 tons
of rabbits in two years ; apd, on Dr. Tidswell’s
report, that seems to be doubtful. And even if
Danysz can wipe out 59,157 tons of rabbits in two
years, and no more, it would be a fool’s game to
wipe them out and turn their carcases into a
nuisance, when the other; process can wipe the
same quantity out and turn the carcases into
money.
The other day Victoria’s T. Bent suddenly
discovered something that everyone else knew
long ago, wherefore he is now threatening to do
wonders and a day’s work. He is, he says, going
to spend from £60,000 to £70,000 in putting in
thorough order the State school buildings and the
disreputable lean-to’s that pass as teachers’ resi-
dences. He lately saw children entering and
leaving a school through the place where a window
ought to be, and the spectacle moved him to deep
emotion. Perhaps if it had moved Bent to move
Sachse it would have been better; for Heaven
only knows the why and wherefore of Sachse, as
boss of the State’s education, these last few years.
N.S.W. State Minister Perry is hatching
another Anti-Sosh idea. He thinks of establish-
ing farm plots throughout the State—dotting lots
of plots 20 acres big all over it. Perry’s plot is
that the State will provide any land required free
of charge. Any privately-owned land will be
rented at a high rate. Having caught his plot,
Perry proposes that his Government will provide
seed and manure. Neighboring farmers, he un-
wisely imagines, will provide necessary ploughs
and harrows and horses. Newly-stranded
immigrants from Whitechapel, who wish to
go on the land, are to be conveyed free
on the State trains to these plots, and let
loose thereon. Then occurs a hiatus over which
Perry draws a veil. After the hiatus, everybody
goes and looks at the crops. If they have come
up right end first, the farmer gets back his horses
and ploughs and harrows and has the right to en-
gage the men who grew the crop as practical farm
hands. If the crops have committed suicide,
Perry will try something else. It seems rather a
confused scheme, but doubtless Perry knows what
it means.
In regard to a par from “a marine con-
tributor” (20/2/’08) as to the Brighton over-crowd-
ing case, the Port Jackson S.S. Co. points out
that thereis no fear of a passenger boat “ turning
turtle some day ” through the over-crowding of
the top deck, as Clause 30 of the Survey Regula-
tions enacts:
When considering the question of the strength and
stability of the vessel, the surveyor should remember
that as many of the total passengers on board as can find
standing room are liable to congregate on the tops of the
saloons and bridge decks.
So, if the survey is properly carried out, the boat
should be quite safe with all its passengers on
top for whom there is standing room. But this
does not cover one case instanced by our “ marine
contributor ’’—that of the vessel following a boat-
race. There frequently the crowd may be seen on
top of the vessel; not alone on the top decks, but
on parts not surveyed at all for passengers. The
surveyors would not have calculated oh that top
weight, and that particular practice certainly
ought to be stopped.

The pump in “The Dairymaids’” front-
yard at Her Majesty’s. Sydney, continues to work
full time, and it also does overtime one afternoon
a week. So far the hoardings whisper nothing of
an impending change, but there is hard work in
progress behind, and, if all goes well, a fortnight
from now will see a new production, with some
new people in it.
*# * *
“Lured to London” proceeds apace at
Sydney Criterion. Packed houses observe the
trials and ultimate triumph of the beautiful young
parson-hero, and not a soul but sympathises
clamorously with the monstrously put-upon
Harrie Ireland. All is loveliness in the Criterion
garden, and the oof-shrub in particular bourgeons,
like a briar in the spring.

The popularity of West’s Pictures, at
Sydney Glaciarium, is still shown by the big
audiences that patronise the hall. This week’s
change of programme introduces some of the best
films the showman has yet presented.

For the first time in the history of Sydney’s
Wonderland (which is, of course, not very ancient
history), that City of Splendid Night will be, next
Saturday, free to the public. The Freedom of the
City will be until 6 p.m., but those who are already
inside are at liberty to remain there gratis all the
rest of the evening and see the fun. The cause of
this 16 acres of generosity is that the Bondi
Life-Saving Surf Club has entered into a
one-day alliance with Mr. Anderson to
run a number and variety of aquatic sports. All l
the Surf Clubs of the surrounding coast, including
that of Newcastle, will co-operate. A big concert
will be run under the direction of Mr. Southwell,
and all the Wonderland shows will hum as here-
tofore. Tea and other nourishment may be hacl
for the asking—and a coin. The ladies of Waver-
ley, headed bv Mayoress Watkins and Mrs.
Macarthur Onslow, are solidly combined to make a
success of the afternoon.

Spencer’s Theatrescope, at Sydney Palace,
begins to find that cosy theatre too small, on pay
nights anyhow', for the crowds that roll up to get
its condensed melodrama. But the films are not
all melodrama; some of them are satire, and
others are educational. During the present
week, one series will deal with the life of
wild birds at home. How Spencer managed to
be around with the machine while those birds
were engaged in nursery business is a mystery
but as the machine cannot lie, it is evident he got
there somehow. The portion of the crowd that
could not go to the Test matches was intensely
interested in watching Gunn and Hardstaff at
the wickets with Noble bowling to them.
Another film of high educational value is the
“ Pretty Typist,” who flirts recklessly with
every eligible man in the warehouse, sets the
whole establishment by the ears, and thereby
draws the manager’s attention to her beauty,
with the result that the potentate marries her.
The only dark stain on the repertoire is the
cruelty to human animals. On a former occa-
sion a very fat man was compelled to
run at least 5000yds. owing to the bottom hav-
ing dropped out of his carriage, and the
driver being drunk. In the present series, a
pleasant old lady, a grandmother, has to resort to
shaving because a misbegotten grandson, by some
chemical devilry, makes whiskers grow on the
dear old lady’s face.

There is a play running just now to packed
tents at Sydney Hippodrome, and, for origin-
ality of treatment, it beats out of Sight anything
that Shaw, Ibsen, Barker and such-like conven-
tion-smashing moderns have hitherto committed.
“King of the Roads” it is called, and it deals
with the life-story of Ben Hall, bushranger. E. I.
Cole, the author and name-part player, makes the
blood-guilty Benjamin a sympathetic character-
in a word, a Hero. The Hippodrome Ben is no
common malefactor. He smokes not, neither
does he swear or spit. He is by birth a station-
owner of haughty mien ; and discourses in the
correct (more or less) and measured accents of a
Hyde Park or City Council orator. He takes to
bushranging for the all-adequate reason that
a fellow-pastoralist has essayed to deceive
his wife (Tried but True). The would-be
betrayer is neatly described as “a snake
which smiles as it stings.” This person, together
with the police and all who are in favor of i)P"
holding law and order in any way, are the villains
of the piece, and come in for hostile treatment a
the hands of the audience. Ben’s strong poin s
are Manliness (on Manliness Benjamin is a
veritable whale) and a certain maudlin ana
illogical sentimentality which keeps him in a
simmering fever-heat of trouble. Thus the legs
of the amorous pastoralist aforementioned are
seen dangling in mid-air on one occasion as their
rash owner swarms down to invade .

THREEPENCE PER COPY.
Hr HE Editor (being a bachelor, and therefore an
authority on the matter) lets fall a few pearls of
wisdom on the momentous and interesting subject of
BABIES :
“Most people like babies, though different people
like them in different ways. The mother likes to
hold her infant close ; to kiss it; to hug it; to fondle
it; to talk to it. The father likes to dandle it upon
his knee ;to toss it; to tickle it; to hold it above his
head ; to teach it to walk and talk and fight. The elder
sister likes to wheel it out in the new perambulator
for her girl friends to admire ; the small brother likes
to test its digestive powers with various articles, from
green apples to marbles. The lady friends of the
family like (for the most part) to make a great deal of
unnecessary fuss over it: to disturb its slumbers ; to
carry it about, to its own and other people’s annoy-
ance ; and, in general, to go into pretended raptures
over it. Others, again, like babies at a distance ; in
fact, the greater the distance, the better they like
them. Finally, Charles Lamb liked them ‘ b-b-best
b-b-boiled, Madam.’”
No matter how much people’s tastes may vary re-
garding human babies, however, the Editor feels suk
that everybody will like
The Baby, COMMENTS,
which he proudly presents to the people of Austral-
asia to-day, confident that they will take it to their
hearts in warm and royal welcome. It is impossible
for him here to enumerate its many virtues. Briefly,
however, he may say that it is in every respect
Australian. It has been written, Illustrated and
printed by Australians in Australia. It is Aus-
tralian in policy, style, feeling, broadness and cheer-
fulness. It does not contain a single pirated Item,
either in prose, verse, or picture. Among the con-
tributors to the first number (to mention only a few)
are : Alf Brasch, “ Nymsie,” Furnley Maurice, Lillias
Gordon, “Caro,” Jean Sibi, H. G. Selden, “The
Hack,” Geo. Brandt, J. Kenned}', Bessie Barry, and
Lewin Crade. Australians know most of these names
sufficiently well to need no assurance on the Editor’s
part that a right royal feast has been prepared for
them. He will only detain them from it for a
moment, therefore, to thank them and all those who
have been associated with him in his venture, for
their kind assistance and encouragement.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Feast is Spread. Fall On!

over as one man, and report that the fallen one is
still alive, though very wet. Guns are drawn.
Ben’s adherents would finish off his enemy. But
they have not counted on the blithering idiocy
which characterises their idol. He strides for-
ward, strikes up their levelled ironmongery, re-
moves his massive sombrero, raises his eyes
Dowie-like to the flies, and observes :
Never. You shall not kill him—THAT MAN’S LIFE
BELONGS TO ME.
In fancy, one hears the salvaged villain swimming
hastily homeward. The curtain falls. There is
a situation of this sort at the end of each act.
Finally, Ben himself makes away with the land-
owner amid howls of approval from all. The signifi-
cant thing about this play is the courageous fashion
in which practically every melodramatic canon
is violated. Crime (so that it be manly crime) is
at a premium. The humdrum unimaginative per-
son who would assist the police in their labors is
kicked, smitten, overturned, and generally ren-
dered contemptible. The police themselves are
portrayed as sordid wretches, avid to make joyless
the existences of gallant young robbers, who have
no real harm in them, and whose worst fault is a
hankering to wrest a little glamor and color out of
life. Even the pilfered mail coach passengers are
figures of derision—loathly Chows, and clerics
with names like Aminadab Snawl. The big epic
characters are people such as the normal respect-
able burgess is wont to associate with dirt, beer,
blasphemy and hemp. Is this drama the pre-
cursor of others along the same line, glorifying
State fights peace-disturbers, religious experts,
and the like? Not improbably. If so, something
drastic should be done about it.

“ 10-2-4 ” writes :
A quaint performance occurred on the Sydney Agricul-
tural Ground last week. A crowd of Show proportions
(10,000 people the dailies estimated) filled the stands, in
the expectation of seeing a “ Championship Buckjumping
Contest” by Waite, the Dempseys, Molloy, and other
capable Australian riders, and, in addition, “a sample of
horsemanship and horsemastership as practised on the
American ranches.” Few of the local riders of repute
turned up. The ones that did found the “ outlaws ” sub-
mitted to them little more troublesome than so many
livery stable hacks. West rode Jo-Jo, O’Sullivan an
animal billed as “ The Local Outlaw,” and Molloy Car-
dinal. These horses don’t “perform” as Bobs, Coo-ee,
and Rise Up understand the term ; but they afforded
their riders fair opportunities of demonstrating how
properly to handle the moderately refractory' horse, and so
gave a measure of satisfaction to the crowd. The pathos
and humor of the entertainment began when the im-
ported horse tamers took a hand.
A flamboyant-looking person—by name Buckskin Dan
—appeared amid a hush in which you could have heard a
microbe drop, and pointed fatefully to Yellow Bay, a
dejected brute that was standing near the photographers.
Yellow Bay was seized, blindfolded, gagged, and saddled.
Then Buckskin Dan said his prayers and mounted. The
savage kicked languidly once and rooted thrice, whereat
Daniel fell off and lay prone on the ground.
A sign-writer now advanced on the big notice board at
the Kensington end of the enclosure, and inscribed in
large capitals the words, “H. Beasion, of Europe, will
now ride Yellow Bay.” Yellow Bay fixed the European
expert with a lack-lustre optic, suffered him to mount
without protest, executed three graceful bounds, and
then lit out minus Beasion, who had proved even less
adhesive than Buckskin Dan.
Again the painters were observed to be at work on the
notice board. Slowly the onlookers spelled out the
message : “ H. Beasion, of Europe, will ride Yellow Bay
again.” (Cheers.) A lengthy pause while argument
raged in the centre of the ground, then with frenzied
speed the sign-writers’ expunged their original notice,
and substituted the following: “ H. Beasion, of Europe,
refuses to ride Yellow Bay in a colonial saddle.” And so
this particular equestrian marvel retired from the public
eye, and was seen no more.
“ Broncho Bob,” who took his place, proved to be, in
appearance, a typical “ Bad Man ” of the Western States
of America. He was clothed in gigantic feathered
trousers, a red shirt, sombrero hat and long black curls.
He stated that it was his purpose to tame Black Beauty—
an alleged Horror amongst horses. Black Beauty' was
dragged dramatically forward loaded with a contrivance
which seemed in the distance a cross between a hat-rack
and a leather armchair, and was held by a dozen willing
hands while Bob climbed cautiously aboard. But this
creature proved to be already tame. Swiftly but amiably
she ran round the ring with Broncho Bob sitting purpose-
fully athwart her, and then grew wearied, and desisted.
As she did not so much as attempt to shy, Broncho Bob
remained in the saddle.
Followed lassoing, bullock throwing, tieing, and other
feats, at which the cattle-ranching Yank is supposed to
excel. A couple of small humble-looking bulls, three or
four bullocks, and as many cows were shooed into the
ring, and started browsing famishedlv on the herbage
there. To them came one of the red-shirted ranchers, his
long hair waving in the breeze. Arrived at a distance of
about syds., he drew his lasso, threw it, and hit
a bull smartly in the eye. The beast started
violently, walked away with his companions, and
in a bored fashion resumed browsing operations.
Implacably' the broncho-buster followed and heaved his
lasso again. This time he struck a cow. At intervals
the man hurled his futile rope, but always failed to make
good. The gentle kine seemed to sympathise with him,
and to long to be caught; but in vain. Then of a sudden
the lassoer hurled his rope for the manyth time, and by
some extraordinary chance it became attached to a bull.
The tense excitement of the crowd spent itself in yells.
Another rancher, stung to emulation, dropped a hand-
kerchief to earth, wheeled his steed, bent, missed the
handkerchief by about 2ft. and a bad fall by a fraction of
an inch, and passed wildly on. A fellow-desperado slung
his rope at a nearby bull, accidentally hooked a cow
round the horns, plunged forward in the saddle as the
lasso tightened, and, as a matter of discretion, jetti-
soned everything, and let his prey escape. Meanwhile,
the Wild Westerner who had made the successful lasso
was faced with the problem of handling his captive. He
wanted his rope freed, but dared not approach the bull.
Things were at a deadlock. In the nick of time a dairy-
man’s lad leaped the fence from the shilling enclosure,
grasped the animal firmly by the nose and one horn, and
adjusted matters. This relieved an awkward situation,
and allowed the broncho-busting to proceed anew.
The show was described as an “ American Combination
of Riders and Ranchers.” The local horsemen who took part
are not anywhere near Australian championship form,
but they stood out like living wonders in comparison
with the Yanks. These ranchers, had they to depend on
' their lassoing gifts to keep them in meat, would starve
miserably ; were they to rely on their riding to guard
their stock they' would be herdless insolvents within a
twelvemonth.

There is not too much breathing room in
Sydney Tivoli these nights. The three wonderful
Klos Sisters are responsible for most of the multi-
tude, but the support supplied by the Artois
Brothers, Ike and Will Scott, Alma Gray, the
Three Cunards, and a number of less conspicuous
radiances is right up to concert pitch. A good-
sized speck of praise must be awarded to Miss
Muriel Andrews, an Australian girl in her teens,
who appears in the first part and shows herself to
be a violiniste of quite exceptional merit. Though
palpably nervous, she plays a difficult solo in bril-
liant fashion, and receives a well-deserved ovation.
The Bulletin this week was unable to wait for
Mr. Chas. Dumont, of Paris, to play Diabolo.
It, however, beamed benevolently on the Bal-
lerinas’ painstaking rejoicings, and went so far as
to applaud with some violence.
In ‘ When Knights Were Bold,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, the derisive factor is still the
unutterable De Vere. That peculiarly vacuous
noble appears to have no intuitive knowledge that
he is malapropos. He proceeds with his blatant
modernism where any other being would be
silent and oppressed with the dignity of
the surroundings. Rightly speaking, his
heritage should have been a hairdressing
saloon, where his rabid fluency would be
taken as part of his professional equipment. Ex-
changing urbanity and a shampoo for the silver
of bald-headed gentleman, he would have been a
success. As he is, superior people remark “ How
banal!” when he cavorts like a man trying to
sell time-payment oleographs to the heavenly
host.. However, that inexplicable and yet
amusing little cuss is to vanish from the premises
after to-morrow (Friday) night. On Saturday
“ Charley’s Aunt ” will be revived, after the lapse
of ages. Her turbulent flutter and infuriated
clothes are for six nights only.
** * *
“Miss Lancashire, Ltd.,” of Melbourne
Bijou, is becoming such a marked danger to the
gravity of the populace, that The Bulletin con-
templates an impassioned encyclical on “Frivolity,
Yorkshire and Modern.” It will commence with
an axiomatic definition of a jape. Proceeding
from that, it will touch lightly upon accent,
Higgins Junior, and the brand of intelligence that
presumes dog-fights and wild-animal entertain-
ments interesting. It might dogmatise a trifle on
the difference, as amusements, between Mary
Ellen Thompson and slow horses. But its great
effort will be an exhortation to prayer and lamenta-
tion, lest this festival of riot bring upon man a
chastisement of scorpions and the scorn of the
Lord. Inter alia. Miss Florence Baines has intro-
duced another calamitous yawn entitled “No
Wonder He wanted to Fly.” As Miss Baines
sings it, he flew—naturally.

At Melbourne Olympia, West’s Pictures
continue to be gladsome. One concession to
popular faith is the film in which the seventh
Edward is pompously obvious. Edward’s grin is
only a commonplace human convulsion on a royal
face, but he may always expect applause for the
tragedy of his uselessness.

At Melbourne Royal Miss Maud Hildyard
and her satellites play their parts before packed
houses. On a second inspection of “A Beauti-
ful Fiend, ” Miss Hildyard ceases to be astounding,
and is markedly amusing. She plays melodrama
in the spirit wherein it is watched by the aver-
age intelligent ratepayer —with a keen sense
of its incongruities and naive humor. One may
flatter Maud by acclaiming her a fanatic devotee
of the Higher Drama, but her savage exposition
of the folly and futility of Gory Pantomime could
be accepted as propaganda work. Yet quite a
number of people take her seriously by imagining
that she takes her awful play seriously.
They gloat over the needless cadaver, and
the superfluous remains, and are as much
interested in the bloodthirsty Count as if he
were a man instead of a slaughter-yard. And
they admire the bad woman’s clothes, and reckon
that if Worth dresses are the price of sin, it’s a
more profitable game, and a more becoming one,
than bigotry and virtue. Saturday next will see
Miss Hildyard give “ A Warning to Women.”

The panto, at Her Majesty’s (Melbourne)
turns into the straight, and will end its race on
Friday of next week. It is in its third month,
and yet isn’t tired. Neither is the enterprising
public. With a hundred pink girls to stimulate
it, the public finds happiness in “ Humpty
Dumpty,” and loathes to let him go. Gilbert and
Pbydora are singing fresh ditties. Two new
scenes from the brush of W. R. Coleman shed
lustre upon the stage, and the girls who jewel the
Wheel of Life have become such a bright local in-
stitution that when they are gone life will feel
like a cold corned beef meal on washing day.
“Mother Goose’’will be revived for six nights
after “Humpty Dumpty” has vanished round
the corner of that long lane which has no turning.

The Melbourne Opera House performance
is contributing to the gaiety of nations this week
to the exact extent it did last week. This remark
is not the limit of extravagant praise ; rather it is
a veiled reproach. For the Rickardian board
was, and is, weighted heavily with sweetmeats,
and stodge. Beyond Edwin Boyde and his guff,
there is naught that would extract more than a
giggle from a kookaburra. However, Edwin’s
sonorous humor hits this town in its appreciation
with a loud resounding bang.

“ Her Love Against the World,” at Ade-
laide K°yal, has been proving for a week that a
villain can be Foiled just as thoroughly in uniform
as in a frock coat, and that a little-brother-who-
dies (played by a girl) can be just as harrowing
and unlikely in a non-existent kingdom borrowed
from Anthony Hope as in a London slum. The
co. is now making a quick change to the mild
emotionalism of “Camille.” Melba and Dick
Cavill and Fijian Kadavu and his team are, or
have been, also doing their best in their various
spheres for Adelaide’s amusement.
Woodkins and Jugfull have been invited
to bark up another tree, and it will be interesting
to see if they are game to do it. Police Inspector
Dungey told the Vic. Licenses Reduction Board
that “ many of the Collingwood hotels would not
pay the rents demanded for them if they were
conducted properly. The licensees have to trade
on Sundays and after hours to keep the bailiffs
out.” Now, then, suppose Judkins and Woodfull
begin to say a few words to the men who own
these properties and exact these rents.
J. J. Virgo, the Sydney Y.M.C.A. man,
who returned from a trip abroad t’other day, didn’t
bring the slightest doubt about the matter along
with him :
He came back with a firmer and fuller belief in Aus-
tralia as a magnificent country, destined to play no un-
important part in the world’s history. He had seen the
chief ports in the world, but never one like Port Jackson.
He had visited great city edifices, but found few superior
to our own Town Hall. There were botanical beauties
abroad, but none equal to our Palace Gardens. Coney
Island was wonderful, but he preferred Manly. The
Cricket Oval at Lords was historic, but it was not equal
to the Sydney Cricket Ground. Flocks and herds there
were in America, but nothing like the Rivenna merinos.
While for natural beauty what could excel our National
Park and South Coast ?
AT POVERTY POINT.
The disaster that the professional parachutist per-
petually challenges duly overtook Alphonse Stewart
in Melbourne on Saturday. It wasn’t the final catas-
trophe, but the minor casualty, that is liable to arrive
when the parachute spills its traveller on a church spire
or a telegraph wire or something. The “something” in
this instance was one of those quaint mosque-like
structures that adorn certain graves in Melbourne’s
big bone-yard. The performance at the Exhibition
started mauspiciously. The gas-bag caught fire
while being filled, and as Stewart went up an
ugly-looking hole as big as a man’s head, about 10 feet
from the bottom, threatened to split up at any moment.
But he got off all right; his “ parasols ” opened, as per
programme, and his downward track seemed as smooth
as the road to Gehenna, when a gust of wind carried him
over the cemetery and landed him on the dome-shaped
abomination aforesaid. A crowd of several thousands
had followed his course, per motor, bike, horse and
shanks, and was violently angry when the cemetery
authorities slammed the gates in its face. In their eager-
ness to view the expected corpse the spectators would
have swarmed the fence but for a stout barricade of
barbed wire atop. The rash youth was found lying
among the epitaphs with a broken leg and a bad shock.
Considering the locality, this paper opines that Stewart
got the “straight griffin ” to quit his risky business.
Melba receives a severe smite from Sydney Watchman
(20/2/’08) : “Melba has seen the ways of Germany, Aus-
tria, and other Continental countries. In an interview,
the other day, she advocated Sunday concerts. Her Pres-
byterianism is, we fear, a waning quantity.”
“ Harrison O.” : Dramatists are allowed a good deal of
license, but the perpetrators of “A Beautiful Fiend ”
have stepped over the boundary line of probability. To
give two of many instances : Towards the end of the first
act, Sergius Strogoff (hero) goes up to Count Fedor,
Ivarateff (villain), and remarking, “ You will pay for this
insult to niy sister,” strokes his (the Count’s) chest with
his glove, this being the Russian method of challenging a
Woke to a duel, which is the equivalent of the Australian
ceremony of “ dealing out stoush.” Karateff accepts the
challenge, and it is agreed that they shall fight to the
death. But in the second act, which transpires five years
later, both hero and villain are alive and kicking. Pre-
sumably they had drinks on it and agreed to mt bygones
be bygones. Then again, in the last act, the Count, in
full view of the audience, stabs to the heart Ivan Paulo-
vitch, another hero. There is no deception about it; he
runs him clean through with his sword. Yet, a few
minutes later, Ivan comes to life, just in time todehounce
the Fiend. He makes no explanation whatever, and
doesn’t seem to consider one necessary—he just lives.
This has been puzzling me ever since. If anybody should
see a bloke hanging about wearing a fur-lined coat and
with a sword sticking through him, will he kindly return
the sword to its owner, Count Fedor Karateff. Finder
may keep the bloke.
“Araenio”: “Sr.” writes (30/l/’08) re “First Part” at
Melbourne Opera House. Herewith a few disagreements.
He says: “There are always some ‘sisters’ who baulk
and run off at every high note they meet in a song.” Well,
I know the sisters well, and admit they often baulk, but
I’ve never known them to run off until they had inflicted
all their song on the audience. This is their main
defect. Also, “Sr." alleges that there’s always a tenor
who trills something about “ Down Where the Kooka-
burra’s Laughing.” He’s wrong—there’s never an item
with anything so Australian as a kookaburra in it. The
nearest is where the unrivalled comedian localises an
aged Cockney joke by saying Footscray instead of
Hampstead, or St. Kilda in place of Margate. Again,
“ Sr.” says that there’s always a baritone who gurgles
“ Deep, Deep Down.” Not so. The present baritone
sings a song called “ Your Lips, Your Eyes, Your Hair.”
It is the baritone’s habit to sing any old thing, so that it
be foolish and of a molasses-like sentiment. However,
that scribe is right in saying that a coon-singer who can
go head-over-heels is always guaranteed a recall. Irving
Sayles found that out long ago. But even the pliant, ami-
able Irving won’t do the trick until he gets his recall. The
gallery makes up its mind that he must do it, and he is
therefore recalled amidst cries of “ Over ! ” They must
have seen him go over dozens of times, and he doesn’t
do it at all differently from anyone else, but still he must
do it.
“ 10-2-4 ” : Sydney E. News (24/2/’08), discussing the
“ Australian Buckjumpers ” who are dress-rehearsing, so
to speak, in the Prince Alfred Park prior to journeying
Fogwards, asks “Will they take on in England?” and
proceeds to point out that “ Buffalo Bill did well
there with a similar venture.” One concludes that the
E. News man never saw Buffalo Bill’s show. The bucking,
what there was of it, of Cody’s bronchos was of the feeblest
brand. A few anaemic weeds pig-rooted languidly on the
heavy tan surface of the Earl’s Court ring each evening,
and then desisted despite unmerciful flank roping and
rowelling. Buffalo Bill made good on his Indians and on
the spectacular effects he provided. There were
battles between whites and Apaches, amid realistic
prairie scenery, wild pony charges, heroic rescues,
and the burning of unlimited powder. These
things the non-sporting Cockneys enjoyed hugely;
also the fine shooting of Cody himself, who, ten years ago,
was a rifle and pistol shot worth going far to see. The
Buckjumpers will attract an altogether different crowd.
To their show will flock the hunting and racing
people of the Cold Country, who have never
seen this class of horsemanship, and will be pre-
pared to pay big sums for the experience. The
only question is : Will the horses buck? On that is going
to clepend the difference between a sensational success
and failure. Vi hen it is remembered that racehorses ex-
ported from Australia or Argentina to the United King,
dom take many months to become acclimatised, and start
picking up their feed again, one begins to have doubts.
But a horse like Bobs at his best (which is to
say his worst) will infallibly draw' British money.
It is gratifying, by the way, to see that the Australian
combination disclaims any connection with the Yankee
gold-brick equestrians who risked their lives on the show
ground last week. The thought that these flamboyant
incompetents were going abroad to represent the Com-
monwealth in an art it is reputed to know something of,
has induced considerable agitation and blasphemy among
local riding enthusiasts not seized of the true facts of the
case.
“ J. A.C.”: Recently deceased Alberto Zelman was, I be-
lieve, a native of Trieste, and an Austrian subject, although
geographically and by predilection an Italian. He
came to Melbourne under engagement to Lyster, in the
early 70 s, as conductor in the same company in which
were Zenoni and the Coys, and replaced Lascelles. He
married a Melbourne girl, a Miss Hodgkinsoß, who was
one of a troupe of male and female a' robats, known as the
Leotard Family. He was a good conductor, as conductors
If® - ri hi* day the singers did the work, and so long as
the orchestra accompanied them reasonably well not
much harm was done. All that is changed now'. One
thing, however, he did remarkably well. When Lyster
proposed to produce “Lohengrin,” with Palladini and
Antoinette Link in the cast, he had only a piano copy to
go by. From that copy Zelman scored the opera for
orchestra, and, as I have said, did it verv well. He has
left a son who possesses considerable talent—possibly even
more than his father—as a musician.
Melb.” : Miss Baines is an agreeable surprise. I ex-
pected the wooden tomfoolery annealed by repetition.
Instead of this there is something better than even a
bination of Maggie Moore and Yeamans Titus, with the
bloom and gloss on. Miss Baines is judicious in dropping
the Lancashire Girl here and there, and allowing her cul-
tivated self to peep through. Thus in the relief afforded
by her, eminently pleasing singing of “ Home, Sweet
Home,” with a note of genuine pathos, so that the wiping
of her eyes may not be all mock. Then again the topical
song, the first successful one I remember introduced by a
lady. She is just herself there. It is refreshing to have
the Lancashire Lass put off and put on again. A foolish
consistency is the bane of little minds, as Emerson says—
not Billy. The Lancashire language, as given by Miss
Baines, Slone, Boy Glen, and Denis Carney, is far more
effective than the easy Yorkshire of the usual stage
Hodge and Chawbacon.
Apropos the Thaw melodrama, upon which the curtain
has just fallen in the U.S. To show what a theatrical
affair the first trial w 7 as, it may be interesting to note
that Thaw’s attorney carefully arranged and rehearsed
the whole case before the trial, even going so far into
detail as to design the dress and hat that Mrs. Thaw was
to wear in court when giving her evidence !
“G.H.”: At Casterton (Vic.), the last week in-January
has, from time immemorial, been characterised by a
tremendous outbreak of haggis, bagpipes, strathspeys,
and other happenings. This year, the braw chiels of the
Cawledonian Society resolved to knock all former skein-
dhu records into brose ; and so arrangements were made
for holding a great double-barrelled Scottish concert, the
same to rage simultaneously and at once in two halls, and
the performers to be hauled back and forth from platform
to platform in special chariots. But, on the day on which
the blast of pibrochs was to mingle with the skirl of the
pipes, there arrived in Casterton a common Australian
person named Ssuthorp. He brought with him a collec-
tion of buckjumping horses, wild bullocks, and other
exciting substances. Skuthorp’s Bush Circus and the
two Scotch concerts burst open at eight o’clock. At half-
past, the Australian show was crammed to the door,
while ScaWtlan’, with one hall less than half-full and the
other quite empty, wept painfully into its Glengarry cap.
The young McDonalds and the McEvoys, and the McLeans
and the McCallums, and the Camerons, and all the rest of
the Australian-born Scotchmen and Scotchwomen, who
had never in their lives smelt Auld Reekie and are never
likely to do so, made a bee-line for the great horse-feast,
where Skuthorp and his bushwhackers rode four-legged
earthquakes and performed feats of strength and skill,
indigenous to the country. There is a moral lurking
somewhere or other in this parable.
“ D.” : Florrie Young—she of the masterful jaw and
voice—at present nursing a bad' throat at the Australia
Hotel, re-appears shortly in comic opera. As to volume,
the F. Young organ shows little sign, so far, of
the wear and tear of ancient and long usage. It
still carries with bullet-like precision to the farthest
recesses of the gallery. But the old tone-quality
has deteriorated much during the last twelve
months. And already the retirement of Florence is can-
vassed in circles where unrecognised voice, and partially
recognised voice, and the ruins of departed voice do con-
gregate. Considering the number of pretty young women
with gorgeous top-notes hereabouts (the German tenor
Studemund vowed Sydney was unique in this regard) the
wonder is that the old favorites hold the fort as long as
they do.
“ H.”: The utter beauty of Julius Knight as he appears
in the brief mauve “chimmy”and gorgeously-jewelled
trappings of Claudian, the Calamity Dispenser, has caused
a recrudescence of sentiment in regard to this mime
in the breasts of the local fair. The patient ear
of the man in the tram is outraged daily by
female raving re the mollasses-like “ sweetness ”
of Julius. The “notion” shops have stocked his
photos, and are vending them in increasing quantities.
Not since his “Sign of the Cross” period, when no
household that held a marriageable maiden lacked a
counterfeit presentment of M. Superfluous and his calves,
have the allurements of Julius been so canvassed in
matinbe-frequenting circles. It is a matter for moody
gratification in many a disorganised ’Arbor home nowa-
days that the Royal management proposes shortly to
revert to “Raffles,” or some other show wherein modern
clothes are worn. Julius in trousers doesn’t allure worth
a cent.

ExhZioiovii s of stewart ’° balloon asc * nt at
The crowd hissed and hooted Stewart when informed
kJV r 'la certain death to attempt an ascent in

The chief attraction of the afternoon was a balloon
ascent by M. Stewart. It ended in the aeronaut breaking
ins leg.— From a summary in the Argus.
Great A.N.A. 1 So long the people’s friend,
To tell to thee the people’s thanks I haste ;
You ve noted well how all our pleasures tend ;
You give us thrill 1 You promise blood—a blend
That strikes our taste.
In Rome (’tis writ in Cicero’s gay page)
They sought amusement with uncommon vim,
Watching the lion (’twas a gentle age)
Bear back the Early Christian to its cage,
Still chewing him.
They craved excitement; every schoolboy’s learned
That Sunday concerts did not “ exes ” pay,
While Caesar tells us picnic-teas were spurned.
E’en Nero from a lantern-show has turned
Coyly away.
The matrons asked “ Will anyone be killed ? ”
When Roman johnnies bade them to a show,
And when informed gore would be surely spilled,
They cried, while joy their gentle bosoms filled,
“ Hooray ! we’ll go.”
The day is o’er ; they leave the dead alone,
And to their several homes the fair ones glide,
And Nydia rings up on the telephone,
Telling Calpurnia with disgusted groan,
“ Only three died.”
And nowadays, we’re lured unto a show,
A-scenting danger (feelings just the same
As put Lavinia in a gentle glow),
And when the danger’s over, don’t you know
It’s very tame.
Those dear old customs ! Need we lose them all ?
The A.N.A. could multiply its “ gate ”
By getting all its aeronauts to fall
Once every day. (Just hear the gladsome call:
“By Jove, it’s great! ”)
Give us excitement! Give us thrill on thrill.
Emotions fierce let all our bosoms flood ;
Our halls of pleasure thus you’ll always fill ;
You must not, cannot thwart the People’s will,
WE MUST HAVE BLOOD.

Man is an unreasonable animal. He goes
clown into the earth, and tears out its stuffing of
coal, and expects the weary crust of the world to
hold itself up by standing on nothing and sticking
its elbows a bit harder into the surrounding coun-
try side. The foundations of Newcastle (N.S. W.)
have been ascending to and polluting the blue floor
df Heaven fdr years in the shape of sfnoke, and a
gddd hiany Newcastle people hate got rich in a
Hifsiness, the aim of which is to drag Newcastle’s
idtjsibld means of support from underneath it,
and Ship it away to be burnt. Exactly how
much of Newcastle cellarage is solid and how
much is emptiness Wo'dld be hard to say, but the
earth in that vicinity hast lately been slipping
wearily and showing signs that it would like to
fall in on itself and have a rest. So just when
Newcastle is hardly able to support its ordinary
weight, Premier Wade has added to the load on
its thin and doddering crust, by sending thither a
heavy Commission to inquire into the reason of
the frequent collapse. The reason is simply that
there is too much burden on too little support,
and by putting more burden on the same old
support things aren’t likely to be improved. If
the earth suddenly throws up the sponge and
caves’, there will be'a lost Commission, and a vast
hole, and Man the Unreasonable will cry aloud
“Whaffor !”

Otago (M.L.) is a place of many strange
finds. The old Scotch settlers were greatly
addicted to hoarding things up; they burnt
nothing, lost nothing, threw away nothing, and
gave away .darned little. Pictures by Watteau,
MSS,- by Burns, and other curios are regularly
unearthed in Otago. The latest discovery is of
interest to Australia. A number of century-old
charts, showing surveys of the Australian coast
made in 1802, Avhen Commander Flinders, of the
sloop Investigator, sounded the Great Australian
Bight, have just been brought to light at Port
Chalmers. Surveys by Lieutenants Roe and
Moore, bearing additional soundings, are charted,
and a comprehensive survey made by Commander

The old Freemasons’ Hotel, York-street,
Sydney, which was sold recently for £30,000, and
is to be demolished to make way for warehouses,
is the last remnant of the original headquarters of
the “ craft ”in Australia. The Australian Free-
masons’ Hall Joint Stock Co. was formed in 1853,
with John Williams, Robert White Moore, James
Murphy, Joseph Simmons and James Malcolm as
first directors. .. The co. bought the Town Hall
block from Charles Smith, George Smith, Thomas
Roberts and John Kettle, and built lo.dg? rpoms
on the Clarence-Street frontage. Before that the,
goat used to be bestrode in casual places, such
as public-houses, etc. Then the Freemasons’
Hotel was erected, and after that a hall,
wherein some joyous public meetings were held
in the old political times. The arrival of the
Town Hall and other big meeting-places, however,
threw the old Masonic Hall into the shade, and in
1885 the co. died, after having sold the whole
block for £31,000 to a syndicate, of which brewer
Joseph' Malrs'h'all was a leading light. The property
recently sold was only half the original block.
The old lodge rooms were demolished last year.

“Boh”: I have heard of a poor little
housewife, who took the law into
her own hands. She was long-
suffering, and the other lady (who
lived a few streets away) bloomed
like the last rose of summer, but,
unlike that famous flower, she
was never alone. So the little
vvife—'(vhb b’n ordinary occasions
had as) m'uenl individuality as a
caraway-seed —callfed bti the fos'fe
and asked her not to make lovd
to her husband, please ! It was
some time before she made her-
self understood, and the other
lady tried in vain to place her,
and had almost decided she was
a mad district visitor, when the
situation suddenly dawned on
her. And she uprose. “Look
here,” she announced to the poor
little whitey-brown woman, who
was by this time bathed in
tears, “I doh’t want your hus-
band —never did want him—got
a very fine man of my own up-
country. But how do you ever
expect to keep any man if you
wear rags like those ? Why
don’t you dress yourself, woman ?”
The caraway-seed gasped, and
said she thought it didn’t matter
—any old thing would do for her.
“Yes,” said the rose, wisely,
“and you wonder that precious
husband of yours likes to fool
round here looking at me while
you fill .up your time with
frenzied spring cleaning. You
are a lot better-looking than I
am, and I think it is time some-
body told you.” Then she lent
her a clean handkerchief, gave
her a dressmaker’s address and
several cups of tea —and that
was all. Except that it is a true
sto,ry, because the rose told me
herself !
For some time a controversy has been
raging in England between the vivisectionists,
who are accused of having experimented with
hideous persistence on a certain Brown Dog in one
of the London hospitals, and the anti-vivi-
sectionis-us, "who lately raised a statue to the said
Brown Dog, and put on it an inscription violently
condemnatory of the animal’s assassins. Both
sides rushed —as is the way in the Cold Country—
into correspondence on the matter to the London
Daily Mail. Various suggestions were made,
one anti-vivisectionist (female) urging that, instead
of dogs, condemned malefactors should be opened
up and carved to pieces in the interests of science.
But the star effort came from the pen of the Hon.
Artniger Barclay, a member of Britain’s ancient
nobility (his father made his money and title out
of Beer), And hence a crusted Tory of the old
school. Hon. Artniger wrote (19/12/’O7) :
Sir, —Miss Beatrice Scott’s suggestion that vivisectors
should experiment on criminals under sentence of death
is good until one considers that it merely amounts to a
waste of raw material. Are there not others? The
Socialists, for instance.
And so on. It is a pretty idea. And yet if some
one opined that Barclay ought to be dissected, and
then (sav) boiled, he would doubtless feel posi-
tively hurt.
One of Queensland’s imported pests/ t!IV

Brisbane River a Saturday or two ago. The
Upper reaches of the river and its tributaries arc

it, and nearly produced the pf^^iOHsly-mentioned
disaster that almost happened. If is not
attacked hard it will soon close up tne BYfehfiAf,
The Ipswich Shire Council’s only notion of
ing with the curse is to wait until the Bremef' i#
choked, and then put on gangs of men to pole
the stuff down the stream. It is a fine lazy
method, and gives the pest a good chance to
spread about the country ; so the water hyacinth
bidsfair to become upon the rivers of Queensland
what the prickly pear is upon its lands.

“ J.P.’s ” complaint
In the realm of games the latest lunacy is diabolo. It
threatens to become as great a pest as was ping pong—
the tippety-tappety game of cursed memory. Like the un-
desirable immigrant, it came from Asia, having flourished
in Chbwland 1000 years ago. Anything that ever flour-
ished in China seems to have had that honor in ter.r
ancient times, for nothing in particular flourishes there
at present save cheap labor and stinks. This by the Way-
Bill to return to diabolo, Paris revived the curse re-
cently, with the result that France and England seefti to
have become a vast asylum in consequence. The ana-
thema is played by spinning a small double cone, made oi
tin, on a piece of cord about several feet long, and nttea
with a bamboo handle at each end. The player keeps
his hands moving rapidly up and down to impart tne
spinning motion. When the cone is properly balanced
and spinning like a mad dervish, it is jerked up, witn a
smart flick of the wrists, from 10ft. to 150 ft. in the air,
and as it descends the player catches it on the cord, pro-
vided he doesn’t miss it, or catch it on his nose or
corn. If he makes a catch with the cone still spinning
that is “ a throw.” The world’s record (matters have got
to that stage) is 6800 throws, which is awful. The game
can be played by any number of maniacs, who toss tn
spinning lunacy from one to another. Soon the '
be dark with filing cones, and the hospitals full of broken
heads. Then the wave will suddenly subside, and diabolo,
like ping-pong, will be deader than Pilate’s hairdresser.

The miner gets killed and maimed with
dreadful regularity. Hardly a day passes when
the “ Fall of Earth ” headline doesn’t decorate a
quiet corner of the paper and call the attention of
the leisurely reader to the brief two-line message
which says, “A B was killed yesterday
bv a fall of earth in the mine. He leaves a
widow and three children.” The underground
tragedy is so common that, unless the victim goes
out under particularly dramatic circumstances,
just the bare mention of his fate is flung in with
the small police-court news and the late gallops of
unreliable and expensive animals. On one day
recently four men were killed outright and two
seriously injured whilst working in Australian
mines. The four corpses and the two mangled
survivors got exactly 12 lines among them in a
“leading daily.”
Gentlemen who wish to look smart, should
pay a visit to Wild’s hairdressing saloon, where six
first-class artists are engaged. The establish-
ment is under the Patronage of Lord Northcote.

Amongst the houses recently demolished
in the resumed are < of Sydney was that known
for many years as Tne Ship Inn, on the corner of
Gloucester and Essex streets. Though only known
as The Ship Inn since the late ’forties, when John
Bruffell kept it, it is understood to have been a
licensed house in much earlier times under another
name, and to have been a house of call for Michael
Dwyer (who died in 1825), and other Irish exiles
ou their visits to Sydney. It did a big trade in
the times when executions took place each Mon-
day in the gaol yard underneath. The rocks
around formed a vantage ground for sightseers,
and they had a drink before the banging, and a
drink after the hanging, and if there were two
hangings they had a drink between hangings.

, “ J.R.” : After all, according ho h,hp cable,
the end of the Transvaal registration row has
,been a farce, and has
thrown a fine clear light
on Hindu character. It
is reported that when
the handful of superfine
agitators went up to put
their august names to
their registration
papers, the common
herd, described as “a
number of Pathans and
Punjabis,” mobbed
them. It recalls Kip-
ling’s story, ‘ ‘ The Head
'of the ißistpict, ”in which
a typical Bahu, b^ pass-
ing ekarti i ruitiphs and by
'geiierM Subserviency,
Jh ad risen high in the
AJivil Service, and had
at last been appointed
Commissioner of a fron-
tier division. Then all
the fat was in the fire.
The Path an tribesmen
told the white Assistant
Commissioner! wli'6 o’u gh t
to have had the promo-
tion! and the white In-
spector of Police that
they weren’t going to
salaam to “ a black Ben-
gali.” They swaggered
about armed, and got
up rows under the nose
of the new Commissioner,
and finally sent him the
head of his own brother,
who had intended to prac-
tise as a pleader in his court,
with the following notice
“ We found this thing wander-
ing about under our hills,
weeping, and asking its Way-.”
The “ thing ” wove its gold-
rimmed spo'ctA'ol'es, ahd Ml its
paraphernalia 'Complete., the
mobbing 'rtf (jrAttAhi, the JOhan-
Viesburg pleader, Mid those who
kicked hp all the fuss along
With him, is only another proof
that The Bulletin has told
the truth about the Bengali
Bah us who gulled Keir Hsirdie
and the other sentimentalists
into believing in the Indian
National movement, and who
pretend to want to drive the
British out of India. The very
worst thing that could happen
to them would he to get their
way. It is only the British
power that keeps the heads of
the Bengalis and the native
traders on their shoulders. During
the six months or so of ’57 that the
British power was in doubt, no native
trader could call his soul or anything else his own.
At time of writing the Victorian police
had not found William Isles, the young man from
whom they desire to ask certain explanations re
Mrs. Graham’s dead body; and the haze of
mystery that is usual in such cases gathers fast
around William the Missing. He has been seen
at Brighton, North Brighton, Garden Vale, Spring
Vale, Scoresby, Fern Tree Gully, Stawell, Bays-
water and elsewhere. There is a story about a
man wearing a long overcoat and carrying a
sugar bag—he was 6ft. high, weighed 13 stone,
hadn’t been shaved for six weeks, was red-headed,
minus one front tooth, and shuffled as he walked,
also he talked incessantly about murders. This
apparition was tramping north towards the
N.S.W. border. Then there was “a worried-
looking man,” who was seen on a railway platform
close to Melbourne, and a man with two hats who
was noted making very poor time on the road to
Gippsland. These and several other men of
different heights and aspects, and with various
kinds of feet and teeth and hats, are
keeping the Victorian detectives busy. Most
of the men wear the haggard eye of apprehension,
and look furtively back to see if dogs, police, or
infuriated populace are running after them, and
they light their pipes surreptitiously behind trees,
and sh-udder when spoken to. This numerous
William lies is mostly applying for work, and he
is an expert butcher, gardener, carpenter and
pick-and-shovelist. Meanwhile it is worth noting
that William has about two months’ stiirt, and if
he really had anything on his mind—even
the possibility of being sued for breach of
promise—when he left, he should by this time lie
tearing through Cooktown in a northerly diree-
tion, instead of striking attitudes on Melbourne
suburban railway platforms.

REFORMED WHARF-LABORER : “ Yes, me friends,
afore I joined th' army I used to beat me wife
terrible; but since I've been saved I’m that
quiet an’ ’umble-like that she belts ’ell out
er me?”
The typical Australian Hoy hi ml
ippeaked ih 'the witness-box arid the bright
light of fame at Adelaide Police Court the other
day. As the youngsters paraded the streets
(the eldest of the gallant three was but 14) they
noticed a man beating his wife. With no fanciful
utterance or high-flown injunction, but with the
simple threat "to knock off; OF they would bog
into him,” they stopp’ed the cowardly proceeding.
What matters the phrase so long as the heart is
stohc and the cause is good? Some 1400 years ago,
when the Huns bade fair to blot out civilisation
and Christianity, Theodoric and Aetius bogged in
and saved the white race. If that stupendous
Battle of the Nations was simply described in
history as the Bogging-in of Chalons it might not
seem very impressive, but the facts would be all
there. The Lord is with him who taketh up a just
quarrel and boggeth in.
Joseph Hulbert, late of Manchester (Eng-
land), cut his throat (12/2/’08) in the lavatory of the
Sydney People's Palace by way of protest against
the horrible life that is lived in " the Colonies.” He
saw “while at Home” (according to the A M.
Herald) a picture of an Australian farm u bh the
English pattern ” (a Virte-cpVered 'cot, presumably,
With hollyhocks Arid daffodils nodding by the
pOrcli, iVria a gaitered squire donating a ham and
A djiiartern of Old October toa curtseying beldame
at the front gate), and decided to wade in and own
one of that sort himself. Soon Novembers last he
arrived in Sydney. Shortly afterwards he started
for Beleringer (described by the S. M. Herald
as “‘Back of Nowhere”) and the bucolic life.
During all of the 14 hours it took Hulbert to get
to Beleringer people told him snake stories.
Arrived at Beleringer, the natives hurried up and
told him more snake stories. He went shudder-
ing forth into the wilderness, seven miles from
any human habitation, and with never a pub or a
telephone bureau within hail, and the first thing
that hissed at him as he entered was a snake from
the root of an old tree. He laid him down to rest,
but “insects whose habits and natures he did not
understand crawled over him,” and forbade sleep.
Horrified, he abandoned the embryo farm, and
started to hump his bluey to Orange. Humping
bluey was, in his case, a matter of donning a
bowler hat, brushing his English clothes, and
shouldering a large portmanteau. Orange proved
a deadly failure. Everywhere he found the same
sickening clamor that he should work j and every l
where the work was hard, and wearing, and un-
pleasant. Also, there was a tendency on the part
of employers to demand experience in some line
or other. On a recent Monday Joseph lost an
easy job he had snared, “owing to his ignorance
in the milking of cows.” So he cut his throat.
It is a pathetic story of weak incompetence, and
will inevitably form a useful peg later on to sup-
port a hair-raising Stinking Fish yarn of the
impossibility of the dogged resourceful Briton
wresting a livelihood from these arid parts.

This is the “ Barrack-street Bank,” as distinguished from
“ the Government Savings Bank,” though the Govern-
ment stands behind the Barrack-street institution, and
certainly would have to prop it up in time of trouble
just as it did in George Dibbs’s day. Formerly the bank
simply handed over its odd change—it might be a million
or so—to the Treasurer ; but things are on a better basis
now, though the Treasurer still gets the odd million or
so all the same. This shows how the funds are invested
and how they used to be invested :
1898. 1906. 1907.
State Loans .. .. £2,314,258 £254,411 Nil
State Securities .. 5,059 3,055,308 £3,458,937
Other N.S.W. Stocks.. 162,204 337,097 458,179
Mortgages .. .. 883,880 1,170,858 1,130,557
Loans to Banks .. 1,258,269 1,433,952 1,607,972
In premises, £74,000 has also been sunk. Of the loans to
banks, £70,809 is at the credit of the bank’s own
working account, which is kept by the Bank of
N. S. Wales as though the Savings Bank were just
an ordinary customer, except that it gets a little
interest when the account is in credit beyond a certain
amount. Apart from this working-account balance
this Savings Bank has £1,537,163 lent out to banks ; and
that seems an absurd proceeding—it means introducing
an unnecessary middle-man, who has to make his ex-
penses and profits. Neither the borrower nor the lender
gets as good conditions, therefore, as he ought to be able
to get. Mortgages represent 16 - 7 per cent, of the total
assets ; that is to say, almost exactly one-sixth. To pro-
tect the .ijank against the depreciation of these special
securities there is a mortgage depreciation account. It
was in credit £44,255 at the beginning of the year ;
£11,879 was transferred to it, making a total of £56,134.
To provide for depreciation, or losses on the sale of fore-
closed properties, £6134 has been written off, reducing
the fund to £50,000. The other £942 shown as written
off has reduced the premises account.
For many years the trouble with this “Barrack-
street bank ” was that it couldn’t possibly see past Parra-
matta ; and even now, when it comes to lending, it
hardly knows there is any N. S. Wales outside Sydney,
the suburbs, and Newcastle. To not even a municipality
outside those limits has it lent a penny. Yet, especially
of late years, it has done a good deal of borrowing in the
country, and now has 15 branches beyond the suburbs
twice as many as it had in 1898, and both Broken Hill and
Newcastle are bigger branches than any in the suburbs.
This comparison shows where the money comes from :
1905. 1906. 1907.
Sydney .. . £3,498,694 £3,663,950 £3,735,334
Sydney suburbs .. 1,158,920 1,291,349 1,434,667
Country .. .. 887,753 1,042,310 1,231,661
Total .. .. £5,545,367 £5,997,609 £6,401,662
There are now 46,663 depositors, an increase of 8014
during the year—more proof of the thriftlessness of the
working classes,” that one hears so much about.
The English Privy Council is apparently of
opinion that there is nothing in the A.M.P.’s rules to
prevent it robbing itself of its all-Australian character
and joining in the scramble for business in Europe,
S’Africa, and elsewhere. Business will therefore be
started in London at an early date ; and it is understood
that chairman A. W. Meeks, M.L.C., has been invited
by the Board to go across and see that the dangerous
experiment gets a good send-off.

This very progressive office has now completed its 21st
year, and it marks its majority with some figures so
striking that many another office must be left wondering
how they have been produced.
The Citizens’, however, decided six years ago
that it would take no other office’s achievements as
a standard, but would establish one of its own. The re-
sults are As the first list above shows, the
expenses in the Ordinary department have been brought
down to £24,190, as against £34,867 in 1906. That, of
course, could be done by simply sitting down and not
pursuing new business ; yet £35,503 was received as new
premiums in 1907, as against £33,322 in 1906. The extra-
ordinary reduction in the expense rate is shown in this
table *

The income in the Industrial department for the last
few years includes some profit on the sale of
securities—£23,96o for the past year. Excluding that,
the expense rate for 1907 in the Industrial department
would be £39 3s. 6d. per cent, of total income, as against
£37 28. 3d. in 1906 and £42 2s. lid. Thus, excluding this
profit from property sales, the past year’s expense rate is
higher than that for the preceding year ; but lower than
all others. There is, however, some show of reason in
this case for including sale profits, because on the other
side dividends on capital are reckoned as expenses, and
the claim of the office is that the directors, etc., earn
their dividends through their personal attention to the
business producing just such profits as these.
As shown in the table, the expense rate in the
Ordinary department works out at £8 Is. fid. per cent.;
and even the A.M.P., which has set the standard in these
matters, last year showed £8 17s. 2d. per cent, on the
same basis. But though the Citizens’ may do the busi-
ness at £8 Is. 9d. per cent.—to the infinite credit of the
staff and those who have organised it —the policy-holders
don’t get the whole of the benefit of the phenomenal
record. For this office has share capital, and shareholders
draw one-fifth of the bonus. For the past year the bonus
will total £58,654, so the shareholders’ “cut” will be
£11,731. Add that, then, to the expenses in the Ordinary
department, and the rate comes up to £l2 Os. 3d. per
cent. Whether the shareholders’ bonus ought to be
added to the expenses in this way is arguable, no
doubt. Anyhow, if it is added, this has to be re-
membered : that in return for it the shareholders
give a quite unique guarantee—they undertake
that the expense-rate shall never exceed 15 per cent.
Still, expense-rates ought to be very largely governed by
the amount of new business written ; and here the Citi-
zens’figures become surprising. The “ Wild Cat ” prac-
tice is to assume that the old business costs 7 per cent,
of the renewal premiums, and annuity business 3 per
cent. ; then the remainder shows the cost of new busi-
ness. On this basis, even counting the shareholders’
bonus in with the expenses, the cost of new business was
last year 60'4 per cent, of the new premiums, which is a
record hitherto untouched in Australia. That the Indus-
trial department feeds the other is very evident. Yet,
lumping all the business, industrial and ordinary,
the Citizens’ last year did the work for £2O Is. lid.
per cent.—a better rate than the majority of even
Ordinary department offices can show.
The interest-earnings are comparatively low :

These are a fine lot of assets ; they ought to make any
insurer feel comfortable. The bonuses now stand in the
front rank. Yet the valuation adopted to arrive at the
co.’s liabilities is on a severe basis : the interest earnings
are assumed to be only 2J per cent, for the newer and 3
per cent, for the older policies. This calls necessarily for
large and strong reserves ; obviously an office must put
more by to produce a given sum when it assumes a low
rate of interest than when it assumes a high rate ; and it
is only the surplus that is divided. No question is of
more importance in life assurance than that of strength
of reserves coupled with quality of securities ; for on that
depends the office’s capacity to meet its contract with
the insurer who goes on living after the majority have
had their dig at the funds.

Of the profit (£153,599) £15,957 was written off, leaving
£137,642 net. The amount spent on construction during
the half-year was £45,607, so that the expenditure is not
nearly covered by the amount written off, which has been
the thing aimed at for some years past. On the other
hand, very large sums were spent on development work,
undertaken when metal prices were high ; and the Broken
Hill Prop, charges all stich work to working account, and
not to capital. Nominally the reserves at the end of the
half-year were £831,927 ; but nearly half of this is sunk in
plant, etc. The surplus of liquid assets in excess of
liabilities was £497,470 ; six months previously it was
£686,420; 12 months previously, £614,682. Therefore, in
the past six months, in order to pay the dividends
(£288,000) and provide plant, etc., the liquid assets had
to be drawn on to the extent of £188,950.
The B. H. Prop.’s net profit was £137,642. Six
months ago, in overhauling the co.’s half-yearly returns,
it was stated here that “ the difference between the half-
year’s average for lead and the past seven years’ average
is £5 14s. sd. per ton ; so if lead had been at an average
price during the half-year, the profit would have been
£139,838 instead of £308,238.” A fall of that much was
pooh-poohed as absurd ; yet here we have it, and a little
more on top of it. Moreover, the net profit has fallen
below £139,833, though metals have not got down to any-
thing like their seven years’ average. The average net
price realised for lead was £l6 4s. 9d. ; the mean of the
half-years’ averages since 1900 is £l2 16s. 9d.,0r£3 Bs.
per ton less than was averaged last half-year. On an output
of 29,612 tons, the lower price would mean a further shrink-
age of £100,679 ; and that would make the net profits look
very small —£39,159. Two or three things have, however,
to be set against this : (1) There has been heavy outlay
on development work ; all prudent cos. rush on this
work while metals are high, and get the benefit of it when
markets are slack. (2) Probably some of the lead out-
put (unsold) has been valued at less than £l6 4s. 9d. (3)
The output of zinc product is steadily increasing, and
general manager Delprat hopes to be turning out metallic
Zinc by the middle of this year. Yet, when those things
are taken into account, the fact must still not be lost
sight of that, for the lead that was sold last six months,
£l6 4s. 9d. per ton was netted, which is £3 Bs. above the
average for the last 15 half-years ; wherefore the £137,642
of net profit isn’t by any means the worst the co. can do.
At what cost the co. could actually produce metals pro-
bably even general manager Delprat doesn’t know ; as
the markets get less favorable the co. might be able to
turn to the richer ores ; also, it probably would cut down
all sorts of expenses. Anyway, in the half-year to
November, 1902, when only £9 17s. 6d. was netted for
lead, the co. still showed £73,459 of gross profit.

This is tremendous. But the co. itself doesn’t put it
quite like that. The profit and loss account says that
the net profit for the past 12 months (this post mortem is
shamefully late) was £58,136. But “ net profit” is such
an elastic remark —the length of the stretch all depends
upon how much is provided to meet all sorts of con-
tingencies. In this case various large additions were
made to reserves without any specific mention being
made of them. So we get this :

Undivided Profit .. 39,165 17,631 21,632 19,767
Certainly the Insurance Fund isn’t the very best kind of
a reserve. Theoretically, at any rate, it is supposed to
consist of accumulated premiums ; but seeing that the
shipping property only stands in the books at £1,060,450,
the Insurance Fund looks large enough to be also a locker
or storage bin for profits not wanted on the voyage, so to
speak. The directors evidently have an idea of that sort
themselves, for now and then they pay a bonus out of
this insurance reserve ; and during the last few weeks
they have carried a proposal to capitalise £200,000 of
these stowed-away reserves.
For many years the co. supplied details showing
the tonnage of the fleet, etc. ; and from those particulars
it was clear that the co. not only provided something
very extra for insurance, but also wrote ship values down
severely out of revenue to cover depreciation. Unfortu-
nately that valuable information is not given this year ;
still, the co.’s policy is shown by what it allows that it did
in the past :

Between 1900 and 1906, 35,115 tons were added to the
fleet, and the book-value only increased £2o7,lB6—the
unknown balance was paid out of profits, and written off
as wear and tear. But what was done in the past year
cannot be even guessed at.
The capital for some years past has been
£600,000. (There has also been some 4 per cent, debenture
stock, about £210,000 for some years, but now reduced to
£168,338.) By the capitalising of £200,000 of reserves
the capital will stand at £800,000 ; and investors are
anxious to know whether the recent 10 per cent, divi-
dend will continue, now that it will absorb an extra
£20,000. It certainly has to be remembered that it is only
lately that the directors began to pay as much as 10 per
cent., and then, as though they didn’t want to commit
themselves to it as a permanent thing, they called 2 per
cent, of it a bonus, payable out of the Insurance Fund —
the fund which has now been mopped up in a wholesale
way. On recent records it looks, however, as though the
co. icould pay the extra money ; but whether the recent
remarkably good times for Australian and Maoriland
shipping cos. will last, only a prophet could say, and the
office prophet is out of repair, through being caught in a
storm without an umbrella.

This co. was in a big land-jobbing way when the ’nineties
opened, and it got into the usual trouble. Part of the
trouble, which hung to it for years, Was that it owed over
£60,000 on debentures, raised in connection with the
Glebe estate. In 1897 the trouble was still so acute that
the Equity Court was appealed to, ahd it ordered a meet-
ing of debenture-holders, who, seeing the fall in the rents
received by the co., agreed to reduce the interest to 3 per
cent. On account of the concessions then got from the
debenture-holders, it was agreed that no divi-
dend should be paid till this debt was wiped clean
out; and, after years of waiting, the share-
holders are now able to read this in the directors’
report: "The Glebe debentures, which were due
in 1903 and 1904, amounting together to £20,155, will be
all paid off during this year (1908). Your directors, in
the report for the current year, will then be in a position
to state what dividend they are prepared to propose.”
Nothing substantial can be expected, however; for
though the debentures will disappear during the year,
the other debts wijl still amount to over £50,000. This
comparison shows the position in that and other
respects: —

The size of the reserves (nominal) is not to be taken into
account at all. City and suburban freehold properties,
for instance, are down in the books at £34,701; yet the
net return from them last year was uqder £2 2s. percent.
There is over £lO,OOO worth (book! value) of suburban
lands which don’t show ss. per cdttt. These lands may
bring in their book value, but it lo6ks like a long, weary
wait; and while the co. waits the people who have lent
it the £50,000 will want interest. How slow realisation
is may be partly judged by the smill amount of the ad-
vances— really balances due on time-payment sales.
Prudence calls, then, for the writing down of values out
of profits, the money being used to reduce the debt to the
public. Fortunately the Glebe estate—the biggest in
hand (£46,500)—is fairly profitable. It is leasehold ; and
the rents, after standing a charge of £2OOO a year for
redemption, show nearly £5 2s. per cent. net. That
estate really saves the situation ; the rents received from
it pay all the interest and most of the expenses. How
things may ultimately pan out nobody knows, because
the future of the land market—especially the suburban
land market—is a dark mystery. But as a steady income-
earning concern the co. is still a cold proposition.

This co. has three reserve funds Redemption Fund
(£8287), Depreciation Fund (£17,141), and reserve for re-
pairs and contingencies (£9255). The last mentioned has
been reduced by £99 during the half-year, and that
amount is shown as written off. The extent to which
these are true reserves is doubtful; so far as they are a
set-off against actual depreciation and wear and tear,
they are not reserves at all, but are merely replacements
of worn-out capital; and apparently capital sunk in the
fresh food and ice business wears out very rapidly. Tl
years or so ago the assets were revalued ; since then .
thing has been written off, and, moreover, additions have
been charged to capital account. Consequently, excer i -
the little bit spent on renewals, the reserves ha. ■ i..
stand about three years’ wear and tear of plant, pi
mises, etc., now standing in the books at £98,489. ’Both
the reserves and the profit, as set out above, are, there-
fore, inflated. The co. issues a profit and loss statement"
purporting to show “net profits (after providing for re-
newals, etc.), £6171.” (The difference between that and
the profit shown in the table is represented by an amount
which has dropped into the reserves without explanation.)
But it is hard to see how profits can be said to be net
unless they have been charged'with the wear and tear of
plant used in producing them. The position in other
respects has changed as follows :

That is before paying dividend: in 2£ years the cash
position has thus been improved by £17,886 after paying
four dividends ; but there is no way of telling how much
of that may be presently called for to replace plant.
Neither are any particulars whatever given as to working
and other expenses.

The doubtful factor in this case is the amount written off
out of profit to cover depreciation of buildings and
wear and tear of plant, etc. As far as can be traced,
nothing whatever is provided for the purpose ; “ repairs
to houses ” are charged to profit and loss certainly, but
no other provision seems to be made to counterbalance
decay. Yet the decay must be far greater than the mere
capital of the co. (£108,000) would suggest, because the
co. owes a very great deal of money, which is also mostly
sunk in decaying assets. For instance :
Dec., Dec., Dec.,
1902. 1906. 1907.
Mortgages, debentures, etc. .. £116,669 £121,303 £120,987
Freehold premises .. .. 180,482 181,063 181,302
Stock and plant .. .. .. 35,412 35,041 34,482
Sundry debtors, etc., less trade

Gross profit on goods .. .. 10,770 13,827 11,813

Management, discounts, etc... 8,236 11,113 9,096
Interest .. .. .. .. 2,458 3,064 2,970
So the freehold premises alone are 55 per cent, greater
than the capital and reserves combined. Part of this
may be land out of which the co. expects to make a profit
over and above book value ; but that won’t be profit if it
has to be used to write down the value of depreciated
premises. And, anyway, unless that land value is in-
creasing as fast as the hotel premises, etc., are deteriora-
ting, the accounts don’t state the position accurately. Of
course there may be a provision for wear and tear that is
not discernible in the published accounts ; but there is
not even a hint to that effect. Under the circumstances,
in view of the very large debt, and the very small addi-
tions to reserves, the 6 per cent, dividend seems to be
larger than the case really justifies.

These reserves, and therefore also some of the past re-
ported profits, are liable to arrest in Victoria for being
suspicious characters, because £14,084 of the total is
“ invested in the assets of the co., renewals of works,
contingent fund, and wear-and-tear account”; and
obviously reserves that are invested in renewals are not
reserves at all—they are merely replacements of worn-out
capital. During the last couple of years this reserve has
not, however, been added to, so apparently renewals are
now being charged direct to profit and loss account. It
is always a question, though, whether mere repairs and
renewals fully cover depreciation ; a time almost inevi-
tably comes when some big work has to be done which the
revenue of one half-year is not able to stand, and against
that contingency a depreciation reserve ought to be built
up. There is no sign of any such thing in this case. The
co. has had a most prosperous career ; for many years it
paid from 13 to 18 per cent., besides building up the
reserves shown ; but latterly it is doubtful whether fair
depreciation is provided for after paying the 12 pgr cent.
The £2OO written off during the past year (aim most of
that, it will be noted, comes out of old reserved profits) is
used to write down meters ; and that isn’t much in the
way of a depreciation allowance.

The co. also has an insurance fund, to which £1257 was
added net last half-year, making the total £7324. The
ore milled during the term was 110,715 tons, out of
which concentrates containing 329,9140 z. silver and 12,460
tons lead were obtained. The profit was thus equal to
£5 17s. 9d. per ton of lead. The average price of lead for
the half-year was £lB 6s. 5d.; so the cost of production
was £l2 Bs. Bd. Put in another way, on last half-years
figures, it takes all the silver and £l2 Bs. Bd. per ton of
the lead to pay expenses. On the same basis, in the pre-
vious half-year, the costs were all the silver and £lolBs.
4d. per ton of the lead ; so last half-year’s costs were £1
10s. 4d. more per ton. This unsatisfactory movement was
partly due to the fall in silver (from about 2s. 9)d. to 2s.
7£d.); partly to poorer demand for the product; part y
also it was due to higher costs, which, again, were largely
due to the large amount of development work undertaken.
Per ton of ore, total costs were £los. s§d. for the first half of
last year ; for the second half, £1 Is. 4Ad. On the other
hand, though the costs were higher, the recoveries of
metal were better ; 75T per cent, of the lead and 54"9 per
cent, of the silver were got out. Probably some reduction
will be made now in expenses ; but, calculating on last
half-year’s figures, these profits would show up at vanous
metal prices:—
Lead. Silver. Profit. Per Share.
£lB 6 5 2/74- £73,350 7/4
17 0 0 2/74 56,893 5/7
15 0 0 2/74 31,973 3/2
14 0 0 .2/6 17,500 1/9
That is per half-year, and the profits are estimated gross,
without deduction for wear and tear. But presently, n
things go well, the co. should receive large payments
from the Zinc Corporation. Nearly £30,000 has so far
been received from that co., but apparently no payments
have been made during the past six months. One mstai-

After conducting exhaustive tests in the con-
centration of the ores at the Broken Hill South mine, the
Mr. Wainwright, has finally decided to instal
the Wilflev type of table, modified in the direction best
adapted to his particular local requirements. The great
advantage with this type of table is that it admits of so
many slight variations which adapt it to meet all classes
°* j^ nsed oreS- Provided the pulp for treatment is
graded it can be used to treat all varieties of ore from
slimes up to coarse grades. When treating slimes and
lightly mineralised ores, care must be taken to have the
slope of the table accurate, and a fine, smooth dressing
surface beyond the feather edged diagonal termination of
the riffles. When treating coarsely ground ores or ores
heavily charged with mineral, as at the Broken Hill South
the riffles or grooves can be carried further along the table
and in some instances right up to the concentrates dis-
charge end. Mr. Wainwright ordered six tables as an
experiment, with fewer riffles or grooves than customary,
and with some of them—the lower ones—carried to the
?. reme e " d °f the table. So successful has this type of
VV llfley table proved that he has ordered 50 riiore from
the Austral Otis Engineering Company. This same firm
has been p acing several of the patent Callow Screens at
Broken Hill and elsewhere. This ingenious and simple
mechanism has solved the problem of grading prior to
concentration.*

Gwalia South (W.A.) half-yearly report esti-
mates the actual ore reserves above the 300 ft. level at
5230 tons, and the prospective above and below that
point at 20,260 tons, making a total of 25,490 tons of an
estimated assay value of 60s. per ton. Other reserves are
hinted at, but, as of yore', the management very wisely
declines to take them into account until further develop-
ment has been done. y
* * *
The annual report of the Sons of Gwalia (W.A.)
has just been compiled, and shows a substantial increase
in ore reserves compared with last year’s figures. Mine-
Superintendent McDermott can claim credit for this, and
also for turning a “ dicky” proposition into a mine that
will bear inspection. A feature of the present deep
development is the driving of the loth level (2000 ft.) on
the underlay, to connect with the workings from the
bottom of an inclined winze put dow’n from the level
above. This working the shoot to be going down.
Tor the year to the end of September last South
Kalgurli (W.A.) earned a revenue of £142,795; but, after
providing for expenditure, depreciation, etc., only
£18,070 (including £431 brought forward) remained as
profit. Dividends amounting to Is. 6d. per share mopped
up £15,000; and from the £3070 left over, £2500 has been
appropriated for writing down the book cost of develop-
ment, and the balance (£570) is carried forward. The net
result of the year’s work shows a falling away. The
average return per ton of ore treated dropped from
355. Sd. in 1906 to 28s. 3d. in 1907, while at times it has
been as low as ‘24s. 6d. The general managers think that
this drop is temporary, but there are others who are just
as sure that it is permanent. When the accounts were
made up the co. had about £56,000 in cash, loans, and
other liquid securities.
* * * ■*
Associated Northern (W.A.) dies hard. Past
year’s report shows it to still have a life of at least 3£
years, and no doubt the current year’s development will
extend this period. The income for J 907 was £173,034,
and the net profit £72,165, which, with £49,872 brought
forward, made a total divisible balance of, £122,037.
Dividends amounting to £87,500 were paid, leaving
£34,537 to carry forward. As the profit in sight is estf-
mated at about 18s. per share, and as the co. has, apart
from plant and stores, at least £160,000 in cash and in-
vestments, the fact that the shares are now quoted at 13s.
or thereabouts is puzzling. Evidently the market doesn’t
believe the estimates wi 11 be realised, and it apparently
also has doubts whether the liquid balance will reach the
shareholders.
* • * «
Great Boulder (W.A.) keeps its end up wonder-
fully Well. Latest estimate of ore reserves show's a gross
value of £2,385,000. This puts the mine still further
ahead of the mill, the gain for the past year being 102,380
tons, containing 60,032 fine oz. In addition, high-grade
ore is being opened up in the bottom workings at 2200 ft.,
and that means a lot when the question of mine valuation
is being considered.
• * * »
The Orion, Niagara (W.A.), is getting a little
newspaper puffing in London. So far, this property,
which was once known as the Hannan’s Main Reef, hasn't
any record to blow about; but, according to recent official
reports, “ the ore is good, and it is not unlikely that sub-
stantial dividends will follow.” The ore may be good,
but, in the Niagara district, even good ore has a nasty
trick of not lasting down.
* * * •»
Westralia and East Extension Co.’s 20-head mill
a f,® onn * eva ' e (W.A.) has closed down. The plant was
old and feeble, and, according to the local papers, that
was why the stamps have been hung up. The mine is
the last thing the local paper will ever blame.
* * * *
The two-head stamp mill is the latest feature of
the State battery system in Westralia. One is now work-
ing on a show at Mt. Margaret, and the Mines Department
is prepared to either sell similar plants on time payment,
or lend them to claimholders in outback centres where it
cannot see its way clear to put a larger mill. The stamps
are 10001 b. each, and the plant has a crushing capacity of
from 2J to 3 tons per day. The motive power is an oil
engine, and one man attends to everything.
The Transvaal, Mt. Morgans (W.A.), is being
got ready to show its real capacity. Some years ago
8., M. and Co. had their eye on this property, but at that
time systematic sampling showed it to be too small for
their purpose. Since then, how'ever, the breaking of

Of the amount written off in the past six months £7780
is in respect of machinery; the other £11,875 is in re-
spect of the new shaft and mullock pass, being the
amount spent on those works during the half-year. The
$io V nnA aft Btands ’ n the books as an asset worth
±tu,ooo, aud that amount will have to be gradually
7„™ en off cut Of future profits. The mill produced
0118 concentrates, containing 7153 tons lead and
i»9,3210z.. silver. The gross profit was thus £7 Is. 9d.
per ton of the lead in the concentrates; and, as lead
averaged £lB 6s. 5d., the cost of production appears to
have been all the silver plus £ll 4s. Bd. per ton of lead—
a very much better showing than that of most cos.
But, in comparing that with the South figures, for in-
stance, it has to be noted that in this North case the
money spent on the shaft, etc., has not been deducted
from the profits, but is shown subsequently as written off.
Setting possible economies against the unfavorable terms
on which concentrates can now be sold—assuming, that
is, the co. can go on producing and marketing lead at £ll
4s - ° d -—then, on an output of 7153 tons of lead, and
with lead at the present price of £l4, a gross
profit of £19,790 would be shown, equal to about 2s. 9d.
per share per half-year. Though the reserves as
shown above were nominally £55,776 on December 31, the
surplus of liquid assets, including stores (£5781), was only
£45,717; and subsequently £7OOO was paid as dividend.
Even that left the co. pretty comfortable ; but heavy ex-
penditure has all the time been going on in connection
with the new mill, so the figures would show up differ-
ently now. Perhaps the chairman will throw some light
on that at the meeting.

For 1907 the output of Wyalong (N.S.W.) was
17,000 tons for 20,3470 z. gold. Of this ore, 3790 tons of
the best treated at Cockle Creek yielded 11,3470 z. The
machinery on the field is valued at £47,770. Develop-
ment work is now at a standstill at all the principal
properties except the True Blue, the.A.M.A. having
withdrawn all miners (some 170), owing to the
owners refusing to concede eight hours from bank
to bank. The True Blue Co. had previously granted
the request. The trouble is one, among - others,
that has been set down for hearing before the Arbitra-
tion Court for the past two years. Tired of the delay, a
conference was arranged between the True Blue Co.
(employing 200 miners) and Beeby, M.L.A., representing
theA.M.A. The result was that the True Blue granted
the request for eight hours. Formerly it was BJ, includ-
ing half-hour for crib. This half-hour is now included in
the working time. Following this arrangement, the
A.M.A. asked Neeld’s, the Golden Fleece, Homeward
Bound, Junction, and minor properties to fall into line.
They refused, pending the decision of the Arbitration
Court, with the result that the men in the mines men-
tioned started keeping holiday on Thursday last.

The capital is £50,000 in £1 shares, so the co. has paid
back 7s. per share. Though the reserves are set down at
£11,998, very little of them is liquid ; including stores,
the total is only £1197. The balance is sunk in machinery
and in development. Also, though the half-year’s profit
is stated at £10,413, a net amount of £1647 has
been spent on development and charged to capital
account. This development consists of shaft-sinking
and driving at 300 ft., the deepest level. The next
level will be at 450 ft. What lies under the
300 ft. level is unknown ; two or three winzes have been
started, but the shaft must be sunk to drain the ground
before they can be belted down any further. On the
whole, the driving has given satisfactory results.

stiu l *’ K lor e (MacFadzean’s Freehold) is trying
' a "? be r float : figures are more modest this time,
no enoo?,'. PfoP’o are being canvassed to form a £12,000
fu i y P ald .to vendors ; £6OOO to public, £2500 of
ieavlL'U?oo be a PP. hed ,n .liquidation of present debts,
leaving £3500 working capital. No hope! Before thev
can expect anyone to liquidate debts or put up cash ih
a '', y Proprietors of Mt. Flora must go and spend
some of their own boodle on the property. So far, thev
have not spent a bean on it. They have rooted out ore,
and it has been high grade ; but that is no proof that
the mine is worth anything. It’s merely evidence that
the original deposit, whatever it happened to be, is now
worth that much less.
The Vulcan (N.Q.) produced 90 tons black tin
tor four weeks’ crushing in January-the best for over a
t 6a ,i' T, u 1S looking exceedingly well, but a reserve
fund will be built up before any more dividends are paid.
. Th , e Golden Alexandra, Charters Towers, has
just cleaned up a crushing of 726 tons for £2682, equal to
•fcrf I is. sd. per ton. This represents a loss over working
expenses alone of about £1 per ton. The co. is now' and
lias for some time been working one reef by .means of
two shafts, the “ top” expenses being thus nearly double
what they should be. If the two shafts were connected
(and they might easily be), there would be a big
reduction in costs. This connection will probably
be made when all the stone is gone. The
co. recently borrowed £3OOO with which to pur-
,cbaseu a block of ground in front of its lease.
Ine holders of this block had held it under exemption
for a long time, but had just reached that point at which
they woidd have had either to w'ork or abandon it. Had
the (-.olden Alexandra W'aited but a short while (and
there was no hurry), the co. would most likely have
picked up the property for nothing, though it is very
questionable if the co. will ever require it. The share-
holders might do a lot worse than probe this transaction
a bit.
* * * *
Grant and Sunset, Ravenswood (Q.), comes out
of obscurity with a maiden “ thrippenny.” Some good
mineral stone is being stoped out from Nos. 2 and 3 south
levels, which are in between 400 ft. and 500 ft. from the
crosscut. A winze connects levels, and a block of
payable ground has now been opened up in towards the
centre of the co.’s 40-acre lease. Mineral stone is mostly
patchy and irregular, and the reef is only from 4in. to Ift.
wide—and what is that among 120,000 shares ?
* * * *
The Great Northern, Herberton (Q.), has got
on to a bunch of good ore just to remind it of old times :
27 tons of stone returned two tons of tin concentrates.
Long Tunnel, Walhalla (Vic.), has unwatered
the north-west workings. This is one of the biggest
mining events in Victoria for five years. The incline shaft
was sunk to reach this stone. But the Extended proved
good gold on the south boundary, so the Tunnel held
off in order to work this ground, and thus give shareholders
a spell. When Pearson had 8000 or 9000 shares, and one
or two others almost as large parcels, Is. a month in calls
was a drag. The south stone has given them steady Is.
divs. for months, and has enabled a reserve of £20,000 to
be built ; so the incline shaft on that score alone has been
justified. This is where the Tunnel luck came in ; for it
has the north-west stone to the good. Quartz proved there
is supposed to total 70,000 tons worth lOdwt. Put costs
at 7dwt., and 10s. profit remains. The ambition of the co.
is to get costs down, so it is putting up a new battery.
There seems to be room for this, because no mine ought
to allow private grinding pans to handle its tailings and
make profits. Yet men pick up the tailings flowing down
Stringer’s Creek and re-treat them.
* * * *
British Lion, Blackwood (Vic.), is roaring a
feeble little roar that isn’t likely to startle away the
hyenas waiting to pick its bones. Their eyes are turned
to the 250 ft. level, from which have been reported “ stone
of new make,” “a lode 2ft. wide,” “payable gold,”
“ stone heavily mineralised," and lastly “ fine gold show-
ing throughout.” Yet the hyenas howl out their doubts,
and are waiting to tear down the scrip and play general
havoc. They will do it, too, if a bull corner isn’t set up.
Frenchman’s Reef, Daylesford (Vic.), has at its
back one of the stoutest supporters of the field in Tom
Hills. He backed the district long before the Ajax was
in its prime, and just missed making a hit. But Tom
Dewy took up with the Victorian Cornish crowd ; and
Tom Hills therefore didn’t get into Ajax. Still he has
Frenchman’s Reef. More of the Victorian Cornish class
of formation exists on the Frenchman’s Reef than in any
other mines on the field. From the lode big veins bear
into the wall. This quartz is said to average 6dwt.,
though a first crushing went an ounce. That seems too
good to be true ; everything depends on how the sampling
was taken. The fact is the field is patchy, the gold does
not live down, and a good deal more than a first crushing
is needed to make a mine.
* * * *
Woods Point (Vic.) is looking up. All Nations
has cut the reef at No. 3 level, and is doing so well at the
intermediate level that a spell of divs. is looked for. The
worst of Woods Point (and All Nations is no exception
to the rule) is that the shoots, though rich, have a knack
of cutting out. At the New Loch Fyne the story is that
a gobd reef has been cut in the north end of the work-
ings. It has to be remembered that there is no reef at the
New Loch Fyne. The quartz exists in the dyke, either as
veins or as floors. The directors want to raise cash to
treat the whole of the dyke on a big scale as is done at
the Alaska-Treadwell, in North America., That means
big battery power and cheap power. Victorians don’t
cotton to big schemes of the kind, so if the New Loch
Fyne is to develop it will have to be slowly. Still it
is a big scheme and worth more than a passing thought.
Montague Moore, of the Moore-Heskett direct-
steel process, writes, re par (B. 13/2/’08): “ About the
process and the meeting of shareholders in the Iron,
Steel, and Metals Manufacturing 00. The co. was formed
for the purpose of proving the value of the process, and
to sell the patents rights. The total capital would be
absolutely insufficient to do more than this. Because there
is no iron industry worth speaking of in Australia, endless
difficulties have had to be overcome in the way of skilled
labor and properly prepared materials for furnace lining,
etc. Consequently, it has taken us- much longer than we
anticipated to arrive at the stage of absolute proof beyond
question—to experts and the public—and the expendi-
ture has been greater than expected. We are now on
the eve of being able to prove, not only that we can save
the 17£ per cent, wanted by the Canadian purchasers,
bu i n u e r'y Uviee that. i therefore ask Tub Bullbtin to
withhold criticism for a few weeks longer. That the
process is revolutionary and dirt-cheap at, the price named
for the Canadian rights (which is £375,000. not. £350,000)
wi 1 very shortly be proved, and a large number of share-
holding Australians will reap the reward of their pluck
in backing up the inventors against the adverse comments
o the press, and the Commonwealth generally will
benefit by the influx of foreign capital. As to the deben-
tures, the directors do not seek repayment of their ad-
vances, but have;agreed .to accept debentures for the
sums advanced by them. The co. is anxious to sell all its
rights for the benefit of the shareholders, and the first of
such rights to be sold will be those for the Commonwealth.
Australia will, therefore, be the first to get the benefit of
the new process and cheaper production of iron and steel,
ine plant we have now erected has enabled us to make
sufficient tests to satisfy ourselves that the claims origin-
'lie' u® u y u ! wIU be amply borne out in the public
nlerwri Iw,-’ IZ far as 1 am able to judge, should be com-
pieted within the next few weeks.”

“ Janor ” : I don’t think the late John
Tinline’s claim (B. 6/2/’08) to have been the first
to import the weeping willow to Maoriland in
1850, Will hold beer. In the grounds of the
original Government House, in Auckland, in the
early ’6o’s there flourished a very large willow
tree, most certainly more than 10 years old. Have
heard old M.L. residents credit Captain Cook
with the introduction of the willow, the first crop
springing from seed distributed by the explorer.
“Drifter”: Scone (N.S.W.) is a happy
little township. I visited it recently, and for
once in my life I almost felt a desire to go on the
land. The hamlet nestles in a green valley be-
neath the shoulder of the Great Dividing Range.
A local plutocrat bitterly informed roe that there
isn’t a poor man in the district, and really cheap
labor can’t be got. The subjects of conversation in
the town are cow, horse and jumbuck, varied by
snake yarns and weather talk. The six pubs in
the main thoroughfare thrive like the herds of
Pharaoh during the fat years. Men who
rattle the coin down on their bars are usually
armed with stockwhips, and each leaves a horse
hung up on a pepper tree before entering.
When merry they tell marvellous lies about the
prowess of their own particular sheep-dogs.
There is no Salv’army in Scone. The only pests
about the place are the grasshoppers, the prickly
pear, and a few Chinamen. The local cattlemen
boast that the town’s stockyards are the best in
the New England district. Twenty square miles
of the most fertile and well-grassed land in the
neighborhood are owned by a single greedy indi-
vidual. Most of the area is lying idle. But the
avaricious lingerer has received notice to get a
move on and subdivide, and local men, who are
bursting to acquire more farming land, joyfully
predict that, when the means of Closer Settlement
are accomplished, things will boom.
“ Gip” on an educational point: —
Ever hear a young jackass learning to laugh ? Came
on two doing something of the kind t’other day. As far
as I could judge (don’t know much jackass) the parents,
accompanied by the uncles and aunts on both sides of the
family, had brought young Jack and his brother to a
master of distinction. When I crept up to the giant
gum the two youngsters were squatting on a branch by
themselves, looking a picture of clumsy misery. Their
relatives sat around and laughed disapproval at their
infantile efforts.
“Now then,” chuckled the master, essaying a soft
introductory shake.
“ Gook-goolt-gook,” sobbed young Jack wearily.
“ Gr-r-r-r-h,” derided his little brother, peevishly, with
a hump like a camel.
“ Hah-ha-ho-hoh,” shouted their uncles and aunts,
broken up with mirth.
The master laughed till apoplexy threatened.
“ Coo-coo-coo-wah-ha-ha-ku-kah,” tried little Jack,
without enthusiasm.
“ Ger-ha-her-haratz,” sneered his brother jealously
sulkily sinking his head in his shoulders.
Poor tired little Jack was worried enough, goodness
knows, and his brother’s insult proved the last straw.
He moved up close and pecked him on the back.. Where-
upon the brother toppled sideways, and, regaining his
balance, went savagely at Jack. The two exchanged
violent pecks accompanied by sounds quite unlike
laughter. The master thought seriously of intervening,
when fortunately a parent arrived with a throat lozenge,
and in the struggle that ensued the relatives and teacher
made good their escape, leaving the youngsters alone
with their benefactor.

“ Mallarapoonie ” : I met Bill again, the
other day—first time in many years. When I
knew Bill last he was driving on the mail line
between Hay and Deniliquin. It was a June
evening, bleak and raw, and Jim big, cheerfu
Jim —was driver of the coach out of Hay. Of all
the drivers in the great wide West with whom I
have travelled Jim was the sunniest. But this
night Jim was silent. No effort of mine could
break his gravity or draw a smile. He seemed
troubled ; but I was the travelling public, and his
affairs were not for me, and so he spoke not. Rain
was drifting on the plains when we met the coach
from Deniliquin early in the night. Bill’s voice
hailed us out of the bitter south wind. He had
an overcarried parcel for the back coach, and
climbed down with it from his seat. “Well,
Jimmy, how goes it?” he asked, cheerily, as he
came to the off fore wheel of Jim’s coach and
peered up at him. (Visions of hot rum and a
warm bed in Hay were in Bill’s mind’s eye after
his long, cold drive.) “ Kid’s ter’ble bad. The
doctor reckons he won’t live,” was all Jim
gravely replied. Bill thought a moment. 111
take her on,” he said solemnly, laying his hand on
the tyre of Jim’s great seven-horse coach. There
was only the slightest tremor in Jim’s voice when
he asked, “Won’t it be rough on y’, Bill?”
“Git down,” was all Bill said. Jim’s kiddy died
at dawn, what time Bill, heavy-eyed and weary,
was punching his jaded team, half-spoke deep in
mud, across the desolate plains. But Jim’s missus
had Jim there to comfort her.

“ J.G.” on snakes :
A man called Joe was pulling some hay out of a stack
to feed his hack with, when, just as he was gathering up an
armful of the stuff, he spotted a big black snake wriggling
awav under bis feet. Also he felt a sharp pain in one of
his fingers. He looked at it, and saw a couple of drops of
blood. Giving vent to a mighty yell, he tore out one of his
bootlaces, and twitched up the finger. Then lie rushed for
the yard, and, grabbing his hack, jumped on its
back, galloped down through the straggling township
like a whirlwind, and headed for Bendigo, 20 miles away.
Going through the township he yelled good-bye to two
or three gaping townies, and said he was bitten by a
snake. A mile further on he met a neighbor coming
from Bendigo on horseback. Joe passed him
like a cyclone, merely shouting : “ Bitten by a
snake 1 Good-bye, Bill! ” The astounded Bill set off
in pursuit of the snake-bitten Joe. Bill thought Joe
might want to sleep and might tumble off his horse. It
was a case of John Gilpin over again. The doomed Joe
flashed through the landscape like greased lightning, with
Bill (whose hat had blown off) tearing after him a mile or
so behind. Joe’s crock begun to tire just before reaching
Bendigo’s furthest-out suburb, and Bill overtook him. A
cab was handy. Joe fell off his horse and fell into the
cab. Bill did likewise, and told the driver to drive like
’ell, as Joe was bitten by a snake. The cabby drove like
seven devils and reached the nearest doctor just as Joe
showed signs of collapse. The doctor diagnosed the case
as one of being pricked by a thistle, and later on Joe
sneaked home on a tired horse, with Bill using language
in the rear. ~
I know another case of snake-bite, but they weren t
hurried people like Joe and Bill. One night Alex-
ander, the cocky’s son, was awakened by a pain
in one of his feet. He gave a kick or two, and
then struck a match, and saw a brown snake
crawling over the floor. He looked at his foot, and
thought he was bitten by the reptile, but wasn’Fsure ;
so he went to sleep again. At daylight he said he felt
drowsy, and casually remarked that he thought a snake
had bitten him during the night. “ Ah, well,” remarked
his father, “ when we’ve milked the cows and made the
butter I’ll take you into Bendigo, and we’ll see what’s
wron<f.” The family then started to milk about 20 cows.
A neighbor happened along, and after a while the
cow cocky chanced to mention that they thought Sandy
was bitten by a snake. “ Good God, you don’t say so !
said Barney, the neighbor. “ What have you done with
him?” “Oh, he’s inside,” remarked Father Cocky.
“ He says he can’t milk, as he feels a bit crook. I’m going
to take him into Bendigo when I take the butter.”
Barney swore dreadfully at the cocky, made a bee line for
his home, and returned with a buggy and a galloping
lorse in the shafts. He had a little trouble in persuading
Father Cockv, who failed to see the need of so much
hurry, but he got away at last. Barney made the journey
in record time, but when he got to the hospital Alexan-
der, the junior cocky, was as dead as he could possibly
he. Father Cocky, plodding in with the cow-grease a few
hours later, was mildly surprised to hear about it.
THE ROMANCE OF BEER.
BILL (dreamily): “ Ain’t it glorioush, Jim?"

“ Edyson ” : X see that a youngster on the
Soustralian side, running from a fire that had
ignited his clothes, was caught in a ba,rbed-wire
fence and literally grilled on a grid. This is about
the most fiendish possibility of a useful but cursed
invention. At a small centre in the Ballarat
district, a few years back, the boys used to tease
a ram by throwing clods at his head, with the idea
of persuading the beast to chase them. One day
a boy tried the game alone. The ram went after
him, and the boy bolted, but got tangled in the
barbs of the wire fence. This time it was the
ram’s turn. Only when a passer crossed to see
what kind of a quaint thing the lie-sheep was
amusing himself with was the nature of the
tragedy known. By that time the boy was dead.

“ Hassan ” : It is a pity that “W.P.B.”
(B. 13/2/’08) takes such trouble to prove my case.
I said that I had only heard of one case of
death by the visitation of shark in the 15 years I
have been surf-bathing. “ W.P.B.” remembers
two shark accidents. I further remarked that
when a surf-bather, having ceased to be
a surf-bather, becomes a “demned, damp,
unpleasant body,” he never seems to attract
the sharks. “W.P.B.” dives into the re-
cesses of his mind and hauls forth one corpse,
which was probably chewed by sharks—or
by garfish. Even supposing it were a case of
shark, one case hardly disproves my theory.
When one considers the immense number of surf-
bathers who tempt the grey-nurse annually—say,
on a small estimate, 100,000—and that, therefore,
out of 1,500,000 two have been taken, whilst in
the harbors deaths are reported pretty well every
year, I think “W.P.B.” had better rake out some
more cases or shut up.

“ Mallarapoonie ” : I notice contributors
bob up at intervals in the “Abo.” column with
ant-cure recipes. They run from chalk lines
and nicotine to rabbit fur and old bags. This is
my process. Take any big old tin, punch a small
hole in the bottom and fill with dry battery sand.
Adjust the tin so that the sand (which is very fine
and heavy) will trickle down the ants’ hole as
from an hour-glass. When the sand starts to run
the ants set to work to keep the hole clear. Now,
an ant can carry but one particle of sand at a time.
Eor a while the ants will take things easy, think-
ing they have a soft job on. But when they see
the sand is gaining on them they will work harder.
Presently they’ll warm to the work and fairly
travel. But the sand they bring up will slide
down again. That will annoy the ants, and they
will start to work like demons. The whole nest
will turn out and work like all Gehenna. All
hands will work like all Gehenna for several
hours, then they’ll start taking spells to wipe the
perspiration oft their foreheads. But that loses
time, and the sand gains, so they renew operations
with appalling energy. No use ! Towards sun-
down a perspiring community of extremely ex-
hausted ants will remove in disgust, making
caustic remarks about battery sand.
“ Flinderino ” : For quaint and in-
teresting sights the southerner should
visit North Queensland during the wet
season — viz., December to March. The
wet season generally lasts three months
and, as far as the coastal towns are con’,
cerned, more rain falls during those three
months than is the case during the whole
twelve months down south. Cairns in the
rainy season might well be termed the
Australian Venice, whilst Geraldton, on
the Johnstone River, presents the appear-
ance of being a mangrove-skirted lake
covered with house-boats. But the long
piles on which the houses are perched
dispel the illusion, and the dwellings look
more like giant centipedes out for a
paddle. By building his house on stilts
the Queenslander kills several stones with
the one bird, as it were. The house so
built is cool, well-ventilated, and out of
the reach of flood-waters ; and, by means
of tin plates placed on the piles, is pro-
tected from the ravages of the white ant.
In dry weather the space between the floor
of the house and tne ground provides a
sheltered playground for the children,
also a cool haven of rest for the family
live-stock. Cairns is separated from
Geraldton by a chain of mountains branch-
ing off from the main range. There is a
gap in these mountains known locally as
the Rain-Cloud Passage. When it is
raining in Geraldton at the rate of 30
hours a day, and the supply of clouds
is in excess of the demand, the surplus
clouds drift through Rain-Cloud Passage
to Cairns, and give that town the benefit
of their watery substance. Cairns recipro-
cates ; but as a rule Geraldton has more
moisture than it can comfortably cope
with, and there is no room in it for any
clouds from Cairns. During the wet season
the business people of these two interest-
ing coast towns go about more or less
barefooted. One sees the bank manager
and the leading draper going to business
with their pants rolled up to the knees,
no socks, a pair of running shoes to pro-
tect the feet, and an oilskin overcoat.
The new-chum shipping clerk or bank
clerk from the south generally tries leg-
gings and strong boots for the first few
days, but he soon follows the example
of the old resident and goes bare-
footed, or wears only light canvas
shoes. The rain does not descend in
sundry intermittent showers, but pours
down deluge-fashion for week
without a stoppage. Street-
i crossings and low-lying allot-
ments are transformed into
rivers and lakes, and many
workmen have to wade knee-deep
to get home to wife and supper.
But the North Queenslander looks
upon these matters as mere trifles,
and goes about his work as usual.
In truth, the wet season is a bless-
ing. It renders cool what would
otherwise be the hottest three, months
of the year ; and instead of parched selections and
dull bushlands, green waving crops and grasses
and briglit-colored shrubs and wild-flowers are
everywhere.

“ 0.,” on the new education :
It is a mistake to suppose that the new education began
with the new syllabus. About ten years ago I was
appointed teacher of a small public school on the
Warrego. I had been there only a few days when I dis-
covered that 7ft. of carpet snake lived under the school-
room. When I sat reading in the bough-shed after the
children had left of an evening, he would come out on a
tour of inspection, and on several occasions I saw him
catch mice. I made friends with him, and brought him
milk, and at last he became quite tame, and would come
to me when I whistled “ Boyne Water.” When I wished
him to clear out I whistled “ Patrick’s Day.”
He liked to hear me talk, and appeared to listen atten-
tively. When he annoyed me I called him names, buthe
didn ! t seem to understand, and looked pleased if called a
cow, or a streak of misery, or a dirty crawler. Unce,
indeed, he seemed put out ; but that was when I alluded
to him as a Reptile Contemporary.
I was an experimenter in a small way, and had a suck
of phosphorus (kept under water) to show the kids hoi
to prepare nitrogen. One Saturday I had gone over to
the schoolroom, and was painting a map of New South
Wales on the blackboard. I was doing it to show the
“ young idea ” the small dimensions to which the Mother
State would be reduced in the event of Federation be-
coming an accomplished fact. (I read the newspapers in
those days.) Well, I was using white refrigerating paint,
and had omitted pretty well all the country north of
Newcastle, and all south of Wollongong, and the Rivenna,
and other parts, and was getting along like a- house on
fire, when Joseph Hector (the snake) came fooling about
and disturbed me. I scolded him, but lie took no notice.
So, as a punishment, I got some of the phosphorus, mixe
it with the paint, and with the compound painted Joseph
Hector from end to end. It didn’t punish him at all. h
was delighted. When he was dry I whistled Fatness
Dav,” and went home to dinner. ..
A race meeting was being held, and the township
crowded. At night we were all drinking at Gladstones
hotel. One of the fellows said, “ Boys, it’s about tune
gave the other pub a turn.” So we all started for
burv’s hotel. On the way we had to pass thesehoolro •
When within lOOvds. of it I began to whistle fioyn

looked only middling, but just then a fat bo

COMPANY FOR TEA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A week or two before our visit the people of lai (Papua)
had asked nine of a neighboring tribe to come over and
spend a happy evening. It is difficult to understand why
the guests accepted, as confidence in your neighbor is no
virtue up the Purari River. Accept they did, however,
and when they arrived the laians ate them, every one.—
Beatrice Grimshaw in S. M. Herald.
The embers glow like serpents’ eyes
The night wind whispers by the shore ;
And someone in the darkness sighs
And gives a long, contented snore.
The chieftain’s wife her temper lost
And stamped her dainty little feet
(Some five-and-twenty beads she’d cost
With coral necklace all complete).
The chieftain’s wife, she spoke her mind
And said so very dull was she,
He’d simply have to go and find
Some people they could ask to tea.
The chieftain was but newly wed,
He sw'ung his war-club to and fro ;
“ What have we got to eat ? ” he said,
And “ Who the deuce is there we know' ? ”
“ Oh 1 don’t stand there,” exclaimed his wife,
“ And say that sort of thing to me 1
I cannot bear this lonely life !
Do ask some people home to tea ! ”
“ Now, Kiddie, dear ! ” her husband cried
In accents tender, low and sweet,
“ If we have people here, my bride,
We must have something nice to eat!
“ We married, Kid, upon the sly
(And very little else, ’tis clear !).
We said we’d live —just you and I
On bread and cheese and kisses, dear.
“ Of course, that’s quite enough for us,
But visitors, you know', my sw’eet,
Are unromantic beasts —they’d fuss,
And very likely ask for meat.
“ I don’t want you to look a fool.
Now — if I were a wealthy man ”
“ My dear,” replied his wife, “ Keep cool i
I have a simple little plan ! ”
And. when she told the plan she had,
He fell and kissed her tiny feet.
(Just then it did not make him sad
To think how much she’d cost, complete.)
“ Let’s write,” she said, “and ask a lot !
Don’t make the invitations long ! ”
(She thought it better he should not—
His spelling frequently was w'rong.)
Next ev’ning, as the sun w'ent down
Across the sea, so deep and blue,
A joyful party, fat and brown,
Came in a single war-canoe.
Their appetites were sharp as files,
And eagerly for tea they looked ;
They greeted their young host with smiles,
And asked him what was being cooked.
He poked his war-club in their ribs,
And laughed, and told them, “ Nothing yet ! ”
They thought that he was telling fibs,
And so they winked and shrieked, “ You bet! ”
Then, as they howled in ecstasy,
He slew them swiftly, one by one,
Then gave them to his wife, and she
Took care that they were nicely done.
The embers glow like serpents’ eyes,
The night-wind moans upon the shore
The guests departed, I surmise,
Into the dark interior.

In advising you to use Chamberlain’s Pain
Balm for rheumatism we know it will give you
perfect satisfaction, as the first application will
relieve the pain.*
Perhaps the best method of settling all dis-
cordant differences as to the claims of the various sites
for the Federal capital would be to induce Mark Ham-
bourg, when he arrives in Australia, to visit Dalgety with
a Thurmer piano, and with its sweet strains charm the
jarring politician into harmonious thought and unison of
idea. On one of his previous visits the now exalted Mark
played on a Thurmer supplied by Allan and Co., of Mel-
bourne, and was quite ecstatic in his appreciation of that
splendid instrument—hence the mention of the Thurmer
in the present suggestion. And no doubt the poetic soul
of the great musician would be inspired by the beauties
of the Snowy River-to compose a real Australian sym-
phony. Why not ? Beethoven wrote a Scotch symphony.*

FAIRFAX AND ROBERTS,
The Oldest Jewellery
House in Sydney,
23 Hunter Street.
“ Aimee ” : I’m not given to contradic-
tion. I merely wish to protect the sleeper-
chopper from the savage attacks of “J.G.” and
“ Broadaxe.” I know him well. No one rever-
ences a bit of good timber more than he does. I
question whether there is any real waste in the
“ squared ” sleeper as compared with the sawn
production. Any fettler will tell you that the
former lasts half as long again as the latter. From
a perfectly-solid log a few more sleepers could cer-
tainly be sawn than may be chopped ; but where
there is a “pipe” in the log, the difference isn’t
worth arguing about. The sawn sleeper is in*
ferior because it is cut across the grain, while the
sleeper-chopper “backs” his off with the grain.
The criminal waste referred to by “J.G.” is pro-
bably the result of the crude efforts of the cockies’
sons, who, after about 14 hours of agriculture, are
packed off by the old man to massacre the forest
by moonlight. They do a vast amount of destruc-
tion, earn a few shillings, and generally wind up
by carving off a toe or two with the broadaxe.
They have ever been the bane of the professional
sleeper-getter.
THE DUBIOUS ANIMAL.
BRIDGET : “Pat, ain’t that ’ere pig fit t’ kill yet?”
PAT : “ Yes, fit t’ kill, but Oi’m domned if ’e’s
fit t’ eat !”
“ McTavish ” : For weirdness, the cry of
the fox will take some beating. To one hearing
it for the first time it is startling. We camped,
one night, at the edge of a scrub. Turned the
two horses out with nosebags on. During tea,
they wandered, and my mate and I set off to
bring them back. It was as dark as the lid of
Hell, and raining, and. I had my macintosh on.
About 100yds. from the camp I stood, trying;to
hear something of the horses. All at once a
weird, dismal wail rang out. Thoughts of
murdered women, and ghosts, and girls with their
feet cut off, flashed through my mind. I jumped
at the same time, and I looked not where I
jumped. I landed among the dead limbs of a
fallen tree. Again the wail. And again I
jumped. I left the tail of my macintosh in the
tree. I sprinted—in fact, I bolted, and the scrub
gave way before me as it does before a wild bull.
By luck I struck the camp and my mate with the
horses, and almost demoralised the whole turnout
in my rush from the weirdness. My bob-tailed
appearance of concern was greeted with laughter.
My mate had heard the cry too. It was not that
of a ghost, nor was it the shriek of a lovely girl
whose feet had just been cut off with an axe by
Albert Norman in the melodrama. It was just a
mere plain fox. But it wasn’t music.
“Tariffina”:
You can never
get a W elshman
to fight unless
you talk music.
Once upon a
time I had a
Taffy sweet-
heart. One day
he and I were
watching a foot-
ball match when
a young fellow
near thought he
recognised in my
companion a n
old friend. He
asked Taff if his
name was Smith.
My lover, who
gives his history
on the slightest
provocation, an-
swered proudly
“No, my name
is Llewellyn
Hughes Owen
Griffiths Rees
Hhffddodd, and
1 live on Flat
Rainbow in a
humpy barrk.”
“Oh, a bloomin’
Welsh mongrel,”
rudely remarked
the stranger.
Now, all my be-
loved did was to
mildly ejaculate
“Indeed and
whateffer ! ” I
felt indignant
and said: “Lew,
if you were a
man, you’d go
after that fellow
and knock him
down.” Lew only
laid his hand
gently on my
shoulder, and
replied: “Neffer
mind, Tariffina,
I am quite satis-
ficashun; I’ll jest
put it down to
ees want of higorrants.”

“Brad.”: “Gip’s” remarks (B. 30/I/’08) re
web-spinning “ tri ” impel me ink-bottlewards
again. As I write, another “ tri ” is working
overtime and sweating himself in my wash-house,
in order to complete his catchment area before the
flies are driven away by the coolth of the weather.
Here is a description of the textile weaver :
Color, brown ; length, about half an inch (never
ventured close enough to run the tape over him);
bingey, large and globular abaft ; head, small,
bordering on the insignificant. If “Gip” still
disbelieves me she can come and ask my cobber,
Bill Smith, for corroboration.
* * * *
“ Gip ” : A school-book taught me that a
snake, with the best part of him in a tight hole,
has great resisting power, owing to his scales, or
something. Have only seen one
resisting snake, and that was on
the lower Clarence. A young
Irishman a new-chum fol-
lowed a sft. lOin. brown snake
to a small hole under a pro-
jecting root. Whether the snake
had dined unwisely, and for-
gotten where he lived, or whether
he dived into the handiest hole,
would be hard to say. Anyhow
the hole was a misfit, and he
wriggled himself into it with
difficulty. When but nine inches
or so of serpent remained above
ground, the Irishman lay hold,
and pulled with all his might.
After a hard tussle the snake
began to give, and the new-chum
was interested to see that though
it went in dead brown, it came
out white. He had been told
that snakes changed their skins,
so was not so astonished as he
might have been. Another
strong pull, and the snake came
easier—still white. A third tug
S-nd the reptile lay exposed,
contorting agonisingly. The
.outer covering had snapped near
the tail, and the snake emerged
skinned like an eel, ready for the
pan, with the exception of the
few inches held by its captor.
Even its eyes came off, and a
drop of blood on the point of
what should be its nose marked
the spot where the skin had
finally parted from the flesh. It
was a sickening sight. For fifteen
minutes or so, the naked and
unhappy thing tied itself in wonderful and
blood-curdling knots flashing in its whiteness,
during which time no one had the kindness or
presence of mind to kill it. However, it eventually
died and seemed pleased to do so.

“ Jimmie Pannikin ” : According to a tele-
gram the other day, Warded, on the Richmond
River (N.S.W.), had registered nine inches of rain
in 48 hours, and “ there is no appearance of its
clearing.” Small wonder that Big Scrubbers used
to call the tiny tinny township “ Wild, Weird,
Wet Wardell ”in the pre-cowjuice days. I re-
member two big floods in one year. Two web-
footed pupils (and no others) attended school
every day during the floods ; so I had to cram old
Sillybuss into the twain during five memorable
days, while most of the males of the township
went shooting, or rescuing, or exploring, or pump-
kin and melon salvaging. lam glad to say that
one of the resolute pupils became a J.P.; the
other married a drunkard. Life has curious com-
pensations, hasn’t it ? Once, when wet through,
I asked an Irish farmer how he accounted for the
awful wetness of Wardell. He said: “ Arrah,
that’s an aisy wan. Shure it do rain between the
shovyers.” It did. It does.
AN INNOVATION.
“Can yer milk?”
“No, bai Jove, I’ve never milked.”
“ Can yer plough? ”
“ Er—no, I can't say that I plough.”
“ Can yer do any blanky farm work at all?"
“ Er—well, not exactly; but I’m a first-rate polo
player, and rather good at cricket, don’t yer
know, and I thought p’raps I could teach
your sons.”
“ Mallet ” : The ancient Groper settler is
a curious specimen of humanity. Out my way
there is one—old Billy Smith—a cripple
about 80 years of age. Some 40 years ago Billy
took up 40 acres of land, right where the rabbit-
proof fence runs now. He finished the last bit of
clearing last year. Billy, like other old Gropers,
resents the advent of the “ T’othersiders,” and
reckons that, as there are too many settlers around
him now, he will have to go further out and
“ make a fresh start.” “I don’t know what the
country is coming to,” he told me, the other day;
“ there’s no ’roo, no ’coomool (’possum), and no
dingoes. The T’othersiders are ruining the
place.” About seven years ago Billy was engaged
in the sandalwood industry, and, while bringing in
a drayload of wood, had a breakdown in the bush,
25 miles from his selection, and 75 miles from the
railway. Being short of water, he had to leave
the dray there, and bring the horses home. He
went out after it three months back—it takes the
old Groper 6f years to decide to tackle a job like
that—and found that the sandalwood was all
gone, and all the iron work of the dray had been
taken. Now his language concerning the “blanky
T’othersiders as done it ” is hotter than a bush
fire.
“ Edyson ” : Talking of casualness. What
of Border, of Tantoola, in the Bent State? A
swagman passing through Tantoola, which is an
ex-diggings area now handed over to fruit and
tomato culture, noticed that his dog was much
concerned about an open shaft near his dinner
camp. After the animal had made seven visits,
and had grown quite excited about it, theswaggie
investigated. He thought he heard a faint reply
when he yelled into the darkness. He told
another man about it, and passed on. The other
man yelled, and, not being sure about the reply,
appealed to some more people. Eventually a
windlass was rigged, and an ex-miner was
lowered to investigate. The man on the
rope found a badly-dismantled female at
the bottom of the shaft. The woman was
brought to the surface with some difficulty,
and there recognised as the wife of Forder,
a neighboring tomato-king. She said she had
been in the hole three days and two nights. Mrs.
Forder was carried home without delay, and
Forder met the party on his front verandah.
Excited explanations were offered. Forder alone
remained calm. “ Well I’m jiggered,” he said,
“ I thought I hadn’t noticed the missus about the
house lately.”
TALUMA LAKE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where gnarled and twisted mallee grows
In thick, umbrageous closes,
And hardy melalenca blows,
A quiet lake reposes.
It hides in undulating plains,
Hemmed in and hid with mallee,
And takes its tribute of the rains
That flood the shallow valley.
When craik and crane come down in scores
On peaceful haunts intruding,
Unwonted wavelets lap the shores
Where bronze-wing duck are brooding ;
When swan and heron through the night
Flap heavy wings and clatter,
In reedy bay and weedy bight
Indignant marsh-fowl chatter.
For this is theirs, and theirs alone,
The kingdom of the sedges ;
By right of usage old they own
The tangled water-edges ;
And each marauding, clumsy bird
That flaps his awkward pinions.
Is cursed by tenants, rudely stirred
Within their own dominions !
In overhanging branches rest
The parrakeet and lory—
A brilliant scheme at back and breast,
A wonder and a glory ;
The blue-cap wrens flirt to and fro,
And rustle in the grasses j
While, mirrored in the lake below,
The flashing robin passes.
And when the moon is round and clear,
And airy tree-tops glisten,
It seems as though some spirit here
Had paused to breathe and listen,
Ere gliding on that silver floor
Between the walls of mallee ;
To pass within some hidden door
Beyond the mystic valley.

merely crude rhymes....Moobal : “ Ashes of youth"
turned over too often... .Job : Not up. You need some*
thing approaching genius to write acceptably at the
length you do re Bairnsdale (Vic.) and ils wandering

mising. It is an old story, and any striking facts about
it were probably related long ago... .The Whistler : Your
Poem on The Bulletin" (though it will never, fora
multitude of reasons, see print in its entirety) brought a
glad, shy flush of joy to the collective office cheek. Par-
ticularly gratifying was verse five, viz. :
False modesty binds not the chair
With tape of scarlet hue ;
Reporters, artists, editors are
Fearless, bright and true.
.. ..Wang : “O’Neill’s” is graphic, but is too loosely put
together. The humor of the other is somewhat artificial.
....Tourist: Lamentable doggerel Runham : Rather
slack of interest.... John L. : Moderate merit 0n1y....
P.J.R. : Rather weak and ineffective Antelope: An
unskilful piece of work Digger: Not nearly good
enough Henley Hunter: Hasn’t quality enough....
Elfrida : Cut out all pars and send to the Accountant,
Bulletin Office, and he will remit. Re “ the sin-tide
swirls,” which we mistook for “the suicide swells” we
can only say that your writing makes very hard reading
when you are in one of your hurried m00d5....
M.G.J. : Good idea ; treatment bad Ooko ”:
Possibly Julius’wreath was gold one side and silver the
other; or again either “ R.N.” or “ Akenehi,” or both
may be color-blind ; or on the first night of “Claudian”
they were hypnotised by the utter beauty of Julius’ Early
Christian epoch clothes, and so rendered incapable of
telling for sure whether the wreath Julius snared was
gold or silver. Or perhaps he got two wreaths. It doesn’t
matter a kuss....Bax: “Shovel” poem reads as if dug
violently out of heavy ground... .Tahuna : “ Bohemian ”
and “Song” both missed fire—but not by very much
Old Tom: Regret can’t spare so much space for dingo.
He would become wearisome in time L.G. : “Belle’s
Hero” was a rabbit man. Well, he might have been
something worse. For instance, he might have been a
Stinking Fisherman, a Tory, an advocate of nigger and
Chinese immigration, and a circulator of Six Hatter
and Petriana lies... .Ghost: “Vindication” rather
obscure, and the meaning is hard to follow
Thorold : Very fragmentary, and not of much account!
Kid: Exactly. The word means to-morrow and to-
morrow and to-morrow—and as to-morrow never comes
it is a general term meaning “ by-and-bye,” “ later on,”
“pretty soon,” any old kind of procrastination. And
now you can go out and have a drink at your own
expense N.N. : Nothing wrong with “ The Petticoat ”
except that it is utterly stiff and wooden and laborious.
Oil the joints of your mind...G.R. (Birchip): Can’t see any
points in “Only a Yarn.” Hume : Don’t think it’s much
improved J.T.S.: Well, pearls are sometimes found in
dust-bins, and sonnets in backyards. The Red Page
Backyard is that sort of yard Edith Cripps:
Characters in Bulletin stories don’t “ tender a bit of
paste-board,” when they hand over their cards. Mostly,
they haven’t got any cards. Also, Bulletin snakes don’t
have “rapacious jaws.” Still you do make one
pregnant remark : “ When we die, we are dead.”
Baldy Jerry: You’re right; they’re not quite subtle
enough J. Hyland: You owe us 17s. 10d.—
time wasted in reading your impossible yarn
Llewellyn : They have a quaint flavor, but are sloppy and
incorrect Shaw N. : A little strained and far-fetched.
....E.J.T.H. : Promising. Try again Fast Boy: A
poor piece of work Joyce : Realistic, but too crude for
print Kookaburra : Novel in tone, but too rough in
execution.. ..4-9-1 : Too laboriously humorous Ethi-
opian: Falls very flat C. Lewis: Clever, but unsuit-
able J.R.D. : They don’t catch on.. ..W.J.A. : Can’t
see much in it Crutch : “ Rhapsody ” has many good
lines, but is too gruesome. Such remarks as “ that foul
worm-heap in the grave” put us off our lunch.... Ger-
trude Aimy: Too thin and feminine. One has possi-
bilities, but wants stronger treatment Lela M. :
Just nice D. J.: The ancient and false “morning-
dawning ” rhyme wipes it out The Whistler: One held
for consideration. No doubt about destination of the
others.., .Brace : They “ resemble verse ” ; but we want
verse...D. G. Cochrane : Ponderous stuff that presumably
passes for humor in England. Punch is stuffed with it.

Gordon Macota : The idea is not new, and you don’t
handle it too we 11... .Tyro : Obviously so; though you
versify very neatly R.J.P. : All your points are good,
but the verses hang fire... .Croydon: Too stiff and
wooden Coonamble : A venerable chestnut H.T. :

WATSON’S WHISKY.
Reach’s Limited, Agents,
It is the stayer who makes history in the artistic
and industrial world, and in the making of pianofortes
the firm of John Broad wood and Sons is the great record
stayer. This English firm dates back to the days of
George 1., when Johannes Broad wood made pianofortes
for the first of the Hanoverian monarchs in London, under
royal warrant, and his sons continued making them for
the royal house of England ever since. George 11. and
his Queen Wilhelmina, George 111. and Queen
Charlotte, George IV. and Queen Caroline, Wil-
liam IV. and Queen Adelaide. Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert, Edward VII. and Queen Alexandra
have all used them. The cynical critic might
possibly object that none of the Georges were musical, and
that VVm. IV knew more of navigation than octaves, and
that the late Queen Victoria was not very artistic ; but it
must be remembered that royalty, even when it isn’t
artistic or musical, usually gets the best. Moreover,
John Broadwood and Sons made pianos for Beethoven,
Chopin and Mozart, and hold testimonials from these
giants of the musical world, whom even the most cynical
critic will admit had some slight glimmerings of musical
knowledge and taste. And that the ancient firm
has not lost its cunning is proved by the fact
that the present-day members of the fifm, which,
like the brook, goes on for ever, have testi-
monials from Melba, Queen of Song, and Alexander
Mackenzie, principal of the Royal Academy of Music.
And a firm that has made for seven generations of
monarchs and for composers like Beethoven, Chopin,
Handel and Mozart, is a safe one to deal with. The repu-
tation of 200 years is not lightly thrown away. And to
the man who loves music but cannot play himself, it will
be good news that this firm has turned its attention to
the mechanical player, and has now placed on the market
pianos which can be played either on the keys or by
mechanical process, all of which, piano and player are
turned out of the same factory, by the same workmen,
with the same hereditary instincts. The British Piano
Depdt, Ltd., 9 Barrack-street, Sydney, is sole agent for
Broadwood Pianos in N. S. Wales,*
PERSONAL
ITEMS
David Syme is dead at 81, but James-
Smith, who wrote for the Age before its late pro-
prietor came into it, is still going strong as a jour-
nalist in Victoria. The Age was first issued on
17th October, 1854, and Smith was the paper s
critic of whatever theatres and art Victoria had in
those days. Strangely enough, Smith is finishing
his newspaper career in the same office where he-
started off scratch more than half a century ago.
He now contributes the weekly comments to
Evert Saturday— the clippings-and-paste rag
from the Age office—wider the pen name of
*• Oliver Surface.” Smith, who is about 85, had a
bad illness a little while ago, but he quite re-
covered, and seems to have got his second wind.
A deceased pressman had many stories
of David Syme. One concerned a furious politician
of Syme’s own dimensions, who called, one day,
to vindicate his character. He had never met the
Age boss, but the Age had slated him almost to
extinction, and he wanted blood. Having boomed
his way into Syme’s office, he changed his mind
about instant execution, and started to bellow and
threaten. “ What if I were to throw you out of
that window ? ” he roared. Pounding the table,
he repeated his terrible question, and insisted oil
a reply. “What if I were to throw you out of
that window?” “Man,” said David, who in all
his life gave no hint that a sense of humor was one-
of his encumbrances, “ Man, you’d break it! ”
“S.S.”: Exclusiveness was one of the most
marked idiosyncrasies of David Syme. He was
always conspicuous by his absence. I did a special
feature for one of his publications for several
years, and I spoke to the big man only once.
Although one of the best known men in Victoria,
he was one of the least seen. He could pass down
Oollins-street, and not one in a hundred knew the
tall, brown, all-bone pioneer. I sat facing him
one afternoon on a tram, while the two men on
his right abused Protection, the Age, and David
Syme—especially David Syme—all unconscious
of the proximity of David. The flinty Syme eye
never faltered, the rusted cast-iron face never lost
its metallic calm. It is simply impossible to
write of Syme and keep iron out of it. His
frame suggested to me the long iron cages we
rode in at the mines; his face propounded a mask
of boiler metal. If I were writing his epitaph it
would be “ Rust to Rust.”
One of the best yarns about old David
Syme was that of the early days when the
Age was fighting for its life. A big contractor
found David in a very doleful mood. He was one
of the few that were intimate with the Age boss,
and he extracted the information that Syme was
financially embarrassed, so he offered to throw a
rope. “It would take thousands,” said Syme
gloomily. “ Well, you can have what you want,”
said the other Scot. The money lent was soon re-
paid. Years after David found that contractor in
the soup, and offered help. “It would take tens
of thousands,” said the busted magnate. “ Well,”
said David, calmly, “you can have what you
want.”
Piefc Dickentmann, the speedy Dutch
pace-follower who hiked about the Common-
wealth a few years ago with champion Robl, re-
turned the other day, and set about advertising
himself in a violent hurry. The court records set
it forth as “ driving a motor-car at 40 miles an
hour through Port Melbourne,” and it cost £lO.
S. W. Chettle, thrown from his bicycle in
an Adelaide street one evening last week, and
picked up dead, was a N.S.W. surveyor till 1892,
when Government retrenchment sent him to S.A.
Albury Club men of 20 years back will remember
him well. At the time of his death he was
returning from star-gazing in the Adelaide Ob-
servatory, where he was second in command.
Died this week, Frank J. Donohue, for
some time a considerable figure in Australian
journalism. For the past 20 years he was on the
editorial staff of the Sydney Herald. Before
that he had been a valued contributor to The
Bulletin (he was responsible for “ The History
of Botany Bay ”), and had had a wide experience
of country journalism. Donohue was a deeply
religious man, and at one time joined an order of
monks, but subsequently came out into the world
again.
James Curley, who goes to England
shortly, has had over thirty years’ experience of
Newcastle colliery work, most of it as a union
official. He passed a couple of years in N.S.W.
Parliament, but Parliament did not yield him the
opportunities for impressing himself personally
that lodges, arbitration courts, and workers’ plat-
forms yielded. He was most at home when coerc-
ing huge gatherings of coal-hewers away from
strikes and into paths of arbitration.
At one of the Sydney police courts last
week there appeared, on a charge of inebriety, an
old Sydney identity. He was fined ss. or
three hours, and he took it out. In the
’forties he was in business in George-street, and
later on he owned North Shore property valued
in boom time at £30,000. He could have got a
shade over £30,000 for it, but was advised to hold
on, and he did so until the boom burst. There
was a mortgage of about £lO,OOO on the estate,
and it seems to have eaten up the depreciated
assets, body, bones and all.
If things go all right “Tommy” Walker,
onceM.L.A. for Northumberland (N.S.W.), will
shortly be wearing horsehair in Westralia, and
doing dramatic poses behind the barristers’
table. After Vie had made a wreck of Rev.
David Laseron, “Tommy ” was hopeless
on the Sydney-side; but in ’9B, as he
insisted on contesting somethin?, the
Federalists sent him out to a Far
West (N.S.W.) district. He was just
as hopeless there ; but when he was
beaten by 7 to 1, some local enthu-
siasts put a ticket in his pocket, and
so he got to Westralia. There Tommy
took a reef or two in himself, and
joined the Labor Party, and got into
Parliament, and studied law, and is now
just about ready to make juries weep.
On the whole, Thomas was probably the finest
emotional actor that has sat in the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment for 30 years past.
’Tis all very well for Mr. Mauger, Post
master-General, to be a temperance advocate, but
if he continues to be so intemperate in advocacy,
he will drive all his best friends to drink—hard,
alcoholic, soothing, stupefying drink.
“Erin Gobb” : To-day’s cable mentions
that the dissatisfied section of the community is
circulating “seditious” leaflets in the British
army. It reminds of J. B. O’Reilly. He was
transported to Westralia for this kind of thing.
However, he took the far more potent course of
oral teaching. He enlisted as a hussar in the
British army. Then he started a Fenian society
therein, and enrolled about 50 members, they
say. He escaped from Westralia after a while.
A rather smart journalist—but that is born in
every Irishman —he wrote a novel, called “Moon-
dyne,” on his Australian experiences. Not much
of an affair, but the curiosity was that it predicted
the discovery of gold in Westralia. O’Reilly does
not seem to have had any practical ideas in the
matter of gold-hunting. Probably the idea was
suggested to him by Reade’s “Never Too Late to
Mend.”
A few weeks ago The Bulletin had some-
thing to say about V. A Wordie. He was a
colored brother, who preached, and taught Sun-
day school, and lectured, and was generally so
respectable that the S. Australian Tory always
held him up as practical proof of the sinfulness of
nigger-exclusion. While the Adelaide papers
were pouring greasy adulation over his new grave,
The Bulletin said that, after all, Wordie was
merely a fluent spouter, and was probably as
shiftless as the rest. Now, the papers which
poured out the greasy adulation six weeks ago are
asking the public for small subscriptions, as
Wordie’s wife (white) and large family are left in
absolute want.
STANDING ON HIS DIGNITY.
LONG SUFFERER (to party come to settle bill): “O! But I say, you know! Ten per cent.
discount's rather much, isn't it t You've owed it more than a year!"
BOUNDER: “Look here! Am I paying this account, or are you?”
The man who got the greatest shock over
the late Queensland elections was little Macart-
ney, who represented the cemetery constituency
of Toowong for quite a time. When he left on
tour Philp’s chances of office were exceedingly
small. But Governor Chelmsford Ordered other-
wise, so Macartney, one of Philp’s lieutenants,
and a dead certainty for the Attorney-General-
ship in a Tory Cabinet that could live, reached
London to find that there had been a crisis. " He
hurried back across Europe by train, caught the
Orient liner, and reached Brisbane the day after
the election —just in time to attend his own poli-
tical funeral. He missed his holiday and lost his
seat into the bargain.
Tasmanian Statist Johnston is chairman
of a Hobart committee which has set out with
the good intention of getting enough money to
found an Andrew Inglis Clark memorial scholar-
ship at the Tasmanian Universit}'. There ought
to be many Australians ready to help in doing
that much for the memory of a man who battled
hard for a United Australia when a United Aus-
tralia had few influential friends. When he left
politics for the Bench, Justice Clark still fought
on, merely changing his weapons ; his object then
was to make Australians better acquainted with
the Constitution, and his “Studies in Australian
Constitutional Law ” is a text book in three Uni-
versities at least. Decidedly a man who deserves
remembering ; and a scholarship is a fit memorial.
THE DEFENCE SCHEME.
After all, it has never been a question of how
many men will serve, but of how we are going to
arm them.
“ Itan,” about a relic of olden times ;
Pioneer Alfred William Compignb, now a nonagenarian,
is the last surviving member of the first Queensland
House of Fossils. Landing in Sydney in 1839, he got
some experience, and then went to manage Coombooble-
coombang station for Henry Lawson. At the place with
the incredible and spook-sounding name he was assigned
a small army of convicts, whom he found real decent
fellows —better than many of the officials. He had a
military commission—which he still hangs on to—and
saw some stirring times about Bathurst with blacks and
outlaws. Later, Compignb drifted north to Bananaland,
and settled at Nindooimba. There were 24 members in
the first Queensland Uppish House, and nearly all were
squatters. This is just about 50 years ago, yet the same
element still dominates the Nominee Chamber.
Count Morner, the moderately-new Swed-
ish Consul-General for Australasia, is a man of
parts. He is scientist, author, linguist, diplomat,
brilliant conversationalist, and incidentally hero.
He has been attache to the Swedish Embassy at
several European capitals, including Constanti-
nople, and owns so many orders and decorations
that when he wants to wear them all, he has
to publish himself in two parts. The orna-
ment that hits the eye hardest is a huge
crescent and star from the Sultan. Decora-
tions include two medals for valor—one from the
Turkish and one from the Swedish Government;
and there is another from France for the compo-
sition of French poetry. Also Morner has written
a book on Constantinople, and possesses an auto-
graph album calculated to rouse the demon of
envy in the mildest autograph-hunter—a book
containing the inscriptions of authors, scientists,
artists, players, musicians and singers.
George Reid, with his jests and his yes-no
and his State grievances, still climbs down the
political ladder. He was once a Town Hall orator,
or a haranguer of great open-air multitudes.
Now in Sydney the tiny St. James’s Hall or the
shabby School of Arts lecture hall are his size—he
is to orate in the latter building some evening soon
upon “N.S.W. and the Federation.” And even
these little places don’t fill nowadays when the
discredited wobbler tells his old jokes and gets his
old complaint off his chest. Reid may yet get
down to lecturing in a piano case by candle-light
with his dog for audience.
Some Australian birthdays for March :

on the sth ; Oscar Seppelt, owner of the biggest
winery in Australia, 62 on the Bth; Artist Tom
Roberts, 52 on the 9th ; Judge Homburg (S. A.),
60 on the 10th ; R. S. Smythe, 60 on the 13*-h ;

25th; Professor Mitchell (S.A.) and George
Giffen, 47 on the 27th ; C. J. Roberts, 62, and
Professor Tucker (Melb.), 49 on the 29th.
An old inhabitant reminisces :
The death, at Manly (N.S.W.), t’other day, of Mark
John Hammond recalls memories of the olden golden
days of the Turon, Hill End, and Tambaroora ; of Byers,
still pursuing the fickle goddess on some Westralian field,
and Holtermann, long since dead, and their £55,00 )
crushing from the famed Hawkins’ Hill ; of 14-stone
“ Northumberland Jimmy,” who left for England with
his weight in gold, and died on the voyage ; of Moses
Bell, the Jew, and many another worthy who made his-
tory in the yelling days. Hammond, like many others,
made his first rise on Hawkins’ Hill. Unlike the general
run, however, he managed to stick to most of his win-
nings, and drifted into house and land dealing. Every-
thing he touched turned to gold. He was, in his early
years, a totally uneducated man, but later on he
attacked the three R’s with fury, and knocked them out
in one round. Also he fought successfully with various
other branches of education. A strenuous citizen was
Hammond.
A classic name is not always an asset. In
Sydney recently a well-known business man found
himself on a tram, while his cigar case and cash
reposed peacefully on his dressing table. To make
matters more stirring, the conductor was a new
man on the run. When the official appeared, he
explained he had come away with empty pockets.
“That’s all right, sir,” said the official; “just
give me your name and address, and you can hand
it into the office. What’s the name?” and he.
hauled outa pencil and note-book. “Shakspeare.”
began the man who was unprovided with coin.
The official simply stopped the tram. “Better
get off, sir,” he said emphatically. “If you’d
said you were Julius Caesar I wouldn’t ha\e
minded, but I won’t stand Shakspeare.” It was
only when the other passengers started to explain
that the gentleman’s name really was Shakspeare
that the conductor began to feel uncomfortable,
but by that time the Bard of Avon had been left
two blocks behind, and there was no chance to
apologise.
IN MEMORIAM—DAVID SYME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Writers and pressmen all! One of the craft is dead 1
Lead is against his feet —linen around his head—
All streeked and stark and sheeted, silent to-day he lies,
Who should be glad that his task is done before he dies.
He worked, fought, schemed and struggled, by lights oft
blurred and dim !
But he was a Man —so break a plate and turn a rule for
him 1
Cold, to the eye, as his cradle town,
On the windy Firth of Forth ;
Tall and tense, and thin and brown,
As his hamlet of Berwick North,
With its people dour, and small trade of corn,
In the grim, grey town was the grim man born.
Tantallon Castle, from his bed,
Ere he knew it e’en, he saw ;
Bass Rock—its obstinate hoar head —
And the cone of North Berwick Law.
Cold, endless mists, and a haggard sky,
Gaunt rocks, and the north winds hurrying by.
With such grim nurses grew he grim,
Strong for his work to be ;
Fate opened out a place for him,
Down in the Southern Sea ;
He fought for the People, and for himself;
Served the Public Good, and the private pelf.
With such strong nurses grew he strong,
Ere the time to fight came nigh ;
The obstinate brain, and the patience long,
And the stubborn fighter’s eye ;
His print gave strength to the Men who made
The stand for Our Land at the log Stockade.
The fight of the landless for the land,
That was stolen by guile and fraud ;
T ie fight of the workless —hand and band—
’Gainst the foreign sweaters’ horde.
When weaker men would have joined the Few
Of money and power —the Man held true.
Power came, and wealth came for his pay,
The laborer got his wage ;
’Twas all deserved, for the burdened day—
For the struggle and storm and rage.
Misunderstanding—misunderstood—
Doing sometime ill things, but most were good.
Mistaken ! Unscrupulous in fight!
Now cruel —misusing power ;
The best of his work was good and right,
And the bad is dead this hour ;
Much kindness beneath that shard so grim ;
High courage was under the shell of him.
Misusing power ! But a lesser brain
Must have misused it more,
Than he resting above Boroondarra plain—
The blue Dandenongs before.
Modest—though flooded success’s tide—
Saved by simplicity from pride.
Chance was his life 1 Yet was he strong—
An opportunist brave ;
Sometime he waited overlong—
Until the People drave—
The People, to-day, led the leader grim,
And, to-morrow, the People were led by him.
He helped himself, but he helped Our Land —
The Nation that is to he ;
The meanest grain of Australian sand
Was by him made more free.
Streeked, stark, and sheeted the dead beside—
Glad man with his work done ere he died!
Writers and pressmen all, one of the craft is dead !
Lead is against his feet—linen around his head.
All streeked and stark and sheeted, silent to-day he lies,
Who should be glad that his task is done before he dies.
He worked, fought, schemed and struggled by lights oft
blurred and dim !
But he was a Man ! So break a plate, and turn a rule
for him 1

POLITICAL
POINTS
Announced definitely that the Australian
small-arms factory will be stationed at Lithgow
(N.S.W.), where it will have the bestof encourage-
ment to grow into an arsenal.
The folly of allowing anybody to slip in
without opposition on the “strong man” dodge
has been shown once more up North. Three
times has “Janny” Leahy been allowed a walk-
over at Bulloo on the ground that he was such a
strong man that opposition was wasted effort.
This time an out-and-out Socialist opposed him,
and “Janny” only just pulled in by the hair on his
brogue.
Although both Bent and Wade have made
many swashbuckling remarks about the alleged
“unconstitutional” character of the Federal
regulations re the size of imported cornsacks, it
doesn’t seem that they will take the case to the
High Odart. It will be a pity if they don’t. The
remarks of the High Court about the ignorance
and effrontery of State politicians should be worth
hearing.
“ Over 1000 Senate speeches have already
been made on tariff matters ; not one has changed
the course of a single vote.”— Daily paper.
Why do these weary persons talk
To others sitting deaf and glum?
Why doth the tireless parrot squawk ?
And why the fierce cicada hum ?
The insect, cockatob, and man,
They do it just because they can l
MAKING A NEW BOGEY.
Mr. George Reid, in a statement made in Sydney, has
recalled attention to a most important question respect-
ing the future of Commonwealth and State. . . . Neither
Mr. William Lyne nor the Labor party will be able to per-
suade the people to pamper the Federal Government in
order to paralyse the States. —Argus and Ruin v. Aus-
tralia.
Gkanny : "That's right, George! Make it as
’orrible as y can. It oughter be jes’ the thing
vi en finished !”
Gkorgie : “ Yes, but I 'opes it'll wear better 'nd
last a bit longer than the other one we made."
It is pleasing to learn that the N.S.W.
section of the Federal Labor organisation is going
to be all-Australian. At the recent confer-
ence the Labor portion of the State Frights gang,
which is Holman and McGowen, received some
very straight talk. Holman was badly defeated
in the election of the Federal Labor Fjxecutive,
while McGowen scratched his way in by the skin
of his teeth only. Owing to the State Frights
tendencies of Holman and McGowen, the N.S.W.
State Labor party has become a mere tail of the
Wade-Carruthers crowd, and a mild appendage at
the rear of the S. M. Herald and Telegraph. It
is a healthy sign that the Labor party outside is
getting sick of the business. Unless Holman
mends his way considerably he is likely to have a
large electorate for sale at next State election.
“F.A.R.”: I have discovered another
thing Australia can’t do. I thought they were all
used up, but I was wrong. In all the length and
breadth of Australia we can’t find a man with the
brains, education, and polish to be our ambassador
in England. The Akgus has reported that some
members of the Australian Parliament, recognis-
ing the impossibility of our ever doing anything
for ourselves, have been proposing that Northcote
.of the Spats shall be ou High Commissioner.
Blow Northcote as High Commissioner !
“ O.B.” : The Sydney City Council Health
Committee has directed its officer, Dr. Arm-
strong, to prepare a report on the question of
establishing municipal milk depdts, with a view
to reducing the infant-mortality rate. Private
enterprise, when applied to milk supply, doesn’t
seem favorable to the durability of the little Aus-
tralian. Sydney infantile death-rate has moved
from 86 per 1000 in 1905 to 109 per 1000 in 1907.
This is an alarming increase, and has stung the
Council into action.
Sydney Telegraph reprints from the
Economist, of Jan. 11, this about the Canadian
banking system :
Perhaps the most remarkable lesson taught by the
American crisis and the world-wide stringency of the last
three months has been the success of the Canadian bank-
ing system.
But the Telegraph forgets to mention that it has
consistently blackguarded The Bulletin’s sug-
gestion for adopting that same banking system in
Australia.
Yardon won the Senate election in S. Aus.
rather easily. His friends worked the sympathy
racket for all it was worth ; they said he had been
unseated through no fault of his own. Then he
had the religious and temperance and anti-
gambling vote. (He was chairman once of the
Congregational Union, and bulks large in those
quarters.) At the same time he had a big vote
from “spielers,” who were incensed with the
Labor party for passing the recent Gaming Sup-
pression Act. But though, for these reasons, he
did defeat a Labor man, the few Tories in the
Senate are likely to be grievously disappointed in
him, because he is a Protectionist and reputedly a
fair employer—he runs a printery.
Labor Senator Findley, supporting Sena-
tor Clemons’ attempt to prevent Australian in-
dustry by making carpets, etc., duty free :
He had been in Japan, and observed that in that coun
try the people did without carpets and linoleums. A
polished hardwood floor was all they required. Why did
we want carpets on our floors in Australia?
Seems fantastic at first blush to find a Labor
Senator advocating cheap Jap customs for Aus-
tralia, but Findley only put the Freetrade doctrine
in all its nude, ungilded brutishness. If Aus-
tralia is to compete without Protection against
low-wage Asiatic countries, Australia will just
have to be content with the low-wage Asiatic
standard of civilisation.
“ 8.K.” : Thos. Bent’s methods of demon-
strating that there are no genuine unemployed in
Melbourne are characteristic of that elephantine
tactician. He offered work to those asking, and
50 responded, whereupon the moilers were in-
structed to go into some wild country in the
Buffalo Ranges. The railway journey was con-
siderable, the tramp into the wilderness after-
wards was a formidable venture for inexperienced
men with Matilda up. There was no assurance
that food and the ordinary necessaries of life were
obtainable on the job, and the men had to pay
their own fares and buy their own tools, and, as
they were broke already and in many cases had
families, the 50 neglected to swarm up the
Buffaloste.eps. Whereupon said Bent: “I told
you so! There are no genuine unemployed in
Melbourne.” Replied a bitter unemployed:
“ Bent won’t believe a man wants work unless
he’s ready to go to Hell to get it, and pay his own
fare ! ”
The Yellow Pup played a prominent part
in the S. A. election at which Vardon walked all
over O’Loghlin for the troublous Senate seat. It
was the Dog’s first real appearance in S. A. politics.
The polling in the metropolitan district was a vast
surprise to the Democrats, who expected a lead of
at least 6000 votes to carry their man against the
Tory country districts. Berruther Gainford and
his crowd, assisted by the Register, had been in-
dustriously promulgating the horrors of Rome,
until the Methodist population dreamed of the
Inquisition and saw the Walls of Derry in
its sleep. The result of the polling
has once again shown that the “ Catholic
vote ” doesn’t amount to much ; but the
Bible Christian imagination is a power to be
reckoned with. There is no doubt that O’Loghlin
lost a heap of supporters because of his faith.
Yes-No Reid has, in obedience-to his
press supporters, declared against the Deakin
Government’s proposal to enjoin compulsory
military training on young men up to 21 years of
age, and has come out as a definite opponent of
the idea of compulsory training. This action has
annoyed Gerald Campbell, secretary to the
Defence League. Campbell has unkindly pub-
lished Yes-No’s ideas of 15 months ago, amongst
them the following : —-
In December, 1906, during the Federal elections, Mr.
Reid was reported in the Sydney press to have spoken
as follows at Maitland : “On the subject of national
defence I regard the protection of the British flag as
our main line of defence against the world, but I am
strongly in favor of strengthening our own line of
defence, and in strengthening the military and cadet
forces. I would like to see a system of compulsory
military drill in the public schools of Australia, which
should be continued until the youths reach the age of 21
years, by which time they should have learned the
rudiments of military discipline and evolution.”
Very shortly after this I personally ascertained from
Mr. Reid that he was then in favor of compulsory
military training up to 21 years of age, and this inform-
ation was published in the next issue of the journal of
the league.
Same old Yes-No!
G. H. Reid, of course, easily reconciled
what passes for his conscience to the introduction
of another Yes-No and one more contortion into
his recent Sydney anti-Defence speech—the
speech in which he declared a universal system of
Australian military training to be an unnecessary,
un-British and disgraceful thing :
He thoroughly believed in a universal system of military
training; not that we wanted it to-day, but that we
wanted to bring up young Australians on those lines to
prepare for the possible great dangers of the future, and
the weight of greatness which we might have to defend
in years to come.
Concerning which, Defence Minister Ewing neatly
commented :
After that, what remains to be done except to enrol
Mr. Reid as one of our supporters? Nothing— if it were
anyone but Mr. Reid. In his case, his endorsement of our
policy means, of course, that having expressed his con-
viction that we are absolutely right, he is compelled, by
force of habit, to prove that his own conviction is abso-
lutely wrong.
The N.S.W. Arbitration Act is being de-
nounced all round as a failure. It doesn’t stop
strikes, mainly because there are so many cases
down for hearing that when disputes arise now the
parties can’t get in. On the same principle, a
play is an obvious failure when the management
has to hang out the “ House Full ” placard, and
turn money away from the box office. Also the
trams ought to stop running in Sydney between 5
and 6 p.m., because they are nearly always over-
crowded in that hour, and many people who want
to ride have to walk.
A NEW READING.
MO, JUNIOR : “I’m afraid, farder, der proberty

Of all the high-smelling acts of the Philp-
Leahy crowd none smelt higher than the purchase
of the Mary vale Estate (Q.) for £90,000. The pro-
perty is in the Cunningham electorate, which was
being contested by an ex-member who had just
ratted on Kidston ; and in the adjoining con-
stituency—Warwick—G. P. Barnes, brother of
Philp’s Lands Minister, was running as a Philpite
against Kidston’s colleague, O’Sullivan. In both
constituencies the Kidstonians were beaten by
small majorities, and there can be no doubt it was
the £90,000 purchase (“for close settlement”)
that did the trick—a £90,000 purchase by a crowd
that had no constitutional authority to spend
that many ha’pence.
N.S.W. Premier Wade had a lot of photos
of Canberra done at the State’s expense, and hung
them for a while in Sydney Intelligence Office,
“in order that the public might have a chance of
forming an opinion of the site N.S.W. puts for-
ward in preference to Dalgety as the future home
of the Commonwealth.” Now, when did N.S.W.
put forward Canberra as the Federal capital site?
And when did N.S.W. authorise Wade to inter-
fere at all in the capital matter, which isn’t his
business ? And by what authority—apart from
his own darned impudence—did Wade pay away
good State cash to a camera-fiend, in order to
gratify his thin, piping spite against the Aus-
tralian Government ?
Some indication of the chances a Federal
city watershed would have, if under N.S.W.
State Government control, is afforded by its
treatment in that regard of its own city of
Sydney. A few months ago the Government in-
sisted—absolutely insisted —that the vegetation
on the Cataract reservoir area should be allowed
to stay, and rot, and contaminate the water (a
warning has been issued as to the deterioration of
the water supply). Now, the same Government
insists on reserving, for the purposes of a consump-
tive hospital, an area which is wanted for the
Sydney catchment. Both actions were taken in
defiance of the Sydney Water and Sewerage
Board. Sydney having been treated that way, what
chance would a Federal city have, if its water-
shed was under the control of the State Insects,
who seem to cherish nastiness and hoggishness as
though they were virtues?
The most uneasy crowd in Bananaland lately
have been the conductors of the four Brisbane
daily papers. Before the elections they agreed to
act sternly towards Kidston and all his metropoli-
tan candidates. When he delivered his policy
speech the Courier boiled seven columns of meat
and merit into a dull, vapid three-quarters of a
column. But the very same day Kidston printed
a verbatim report of his speech in a new paper,
the Freeman, and had it all over Brisbane before
the astonished evening papers could get their
wind. Then he engaged a breezy and effervescent
young man to take charge of the new paper, and
issue it four times a week, with the aid of two
capable reporters. Result: The Freeman’s cir-
culation rose to between 20,000 and 30,000
a day, and that and the result of the
elections made the bosses of the old papers
so uncomfortable that the newest of them,
the Daily Mail, decided to lay itself at
Kidston’s feet. On its past record, the Mail’s
support isn’t worth having ; but Kidston reckons
that its new associations may improve it.
The Queensland Tory party having decided
at last that Philp is an impossible leader, two
others are in the running for his busted shoes—
Macartney and J. D. Campbell. But Macartney
has lost his seat, and now the Tory crowd is
sniffing round to find him another. At first it was
thought that inoffensive old Hanran, of Towns-
ville, should be invited to make himself scarce-
but Townsville is voted too dangerous. So Pom-
pom Forrest (North Brisbane) is likely to be in-
vited to blow himself out.
Premier Bent’s golden-haired damsel—the
Closer Settlement Act—is about to expire after a
brief, but inglorious, existence. As every-
body but Thomas and a few others
foresaw, the wholesale State-
purchase of estates, with-
out the steadying effect
of a land-tax, sent
values racing up t
wherefore the Closer
Settlement Board
has not been able
to buy a solitary
estate since March,
1907, prices asked
being invariably too
high. Now, though
the expensive Board
will still remain to
gather in the pay-
ments, and try to
work off unsaleable
blocks, Bent talks
of spending the
half-million a year
inimprovingCrown
lands mostly in
the wilds of E.
Gippsland —and
planting confiding
settlers out on the
peaks of the Edge.
Anything to arti-
ficially boost up the
values of land, and
fend off the land-
tax that will place
that commodity at
somewhere near its
nominal value! Still
Bent is doing some
good ; he is helping
to force Beakin’s
hand.
“ Veldt ” : Even
the rank Imperialist
nourishes the germ of
Socialism deep down
in his heart. Was re-
reading Kipling’s “A
Fleet in Being” to-day,
and came across the following passage
Meantime the Fleet-rams were doing their best to blind
and poison us, and the battleships sagged away to lee-
ward looking like wet ricks ablaze. It was not the
ignominy of the thing—the mere dirt and filth—that
annoyed one so much as the thought that there was no
power in the State which owes its existence to the Navy,
w'hereby a decent supply of State-owned, State-dug coal
could be assured to us. There had been a strike, and
while masters and men were argle-bargling ashore Her
Majesty’s ships were masquerading in the guise of
chimney-sweeps on the high seas. The delay, the dis-
order, the cruel extra work on stokers, not to mention
the engineers, who at all times are worked pitilessly, is in
Peace no more than merely brutal. In War it would be
dangerous.
Ex- Premier Philp and Governor Chelms-
ford, of Queensland, the joint apostles of lawless-
ness and disorder, have received a broad hint
from the new Kidston Ministry. Kidston is call-
ing Parliament together in haste to get an Appro-
priation Bill passed, and until Parliament votes
the money the payment of Civil Service salaries is
suspended. To Philp and Chelmsford it didn't
seem to matter a straw whether they were spend-
ing money with or without Parliamentary sanc-
tion, and their illegal spendings must amount to
at least £lOO,OOO. Parliament refused Philp
supplies to carry him over the elections, on the
obvious ground that it didn’t want Philp at any
price, and wouldn’t trust him on any account
with the management of an election. But
Governor Chelmsford resolved that his pal
Philp should have his chance to manage
the elections, and gave him a dissolution, and
the unlawful expenditure of public money which
followed is a sin which is likely to come home to
roost. Kidston’s refusal to pay out without Par-
liamentary sanction is a cold, impressive warning
that he won’t be implicated in the Philp-
Chelmsford political swindle, and that when the
fowl comes home to roost it will be the sole and
undivided Philp-Chelmsford fowl. The rage of
the Brisbane Courier, because Kidston won’t, by
the illegal expenditure of public money, put
himself in such a position that he must condone
Philp’s action, makes very interesting reading.
“Itan,” from Queensland :
The Bananaland Tory-Kanaka-spendthrift party, repre-
sented by the recent Chelmsford-created and Philp-led
Ministry, planned a few things in the belief that the State
had forgotten past iniquities. If the Deficit-makers had
won 40 seats, Bob, the awful Blunderer, was to continue
as Premier ; but if there was a Tory majority of only one
or two, which would mean a bad time with an aggressive
Opposition, there was to be a change. The leader under
these conditions was to have been little Macartney, so no
wonder he raced back from Europe at break-neck speed—
and arrived just in time for the funeral at Toowong.
“Janny” Leahy’s name was mentioned, but with the
hope of a renewal of the Speakership, and considering his
great unpopularity, he was not bidding for the leadership.
The House is to assemble shortly for a brief session, but the
Governor’s speech will consist of only one paragraph, and
that paragraph will include a statement that His Ex. finds
it necessary for health reasons to return to the Cold
Country. After the awful mess he made of things, it is a
choice between a graceful exit and a shockingly dis-
organised departure. Philp’s crowd was not long in the
Government offices, but long enough to do some damage.
For one thing it reduced, the selling price of the subdi-
visions of the resumed Jiiubour estate to less than the
figure which the State had paid for the land, though
Kidston’s Lands Minister (Bell) declares that he had
buyers for the portion first thrown open at the rate he
originally fixed—a rate at which the State would have
got its money back in full.

Smith, M.H.R.
If there’s a human type that I dislike,
Aye, and despise more deeply than another,
’Tis he who’d have his country primed to strike
In case of need against the colored brother.
What thoughtful statesman will spend cash on ships,
Which the first gale that hums along may shatter ?
Had I my way, they’d never leave the slips—
A fleet I deem a negligible matter.
Of trained militia-men I can’t approve ;
Why should we school our sons to be offensive?
Better to win potential foeman’s love,
Then we’ll not need to stand on the defensive.
The land which guards itself, I hold, is low
(Here is a point one cannot be too plain on),
If you want safety, kow-tow to the foe ;
Not Might but Manners is the sine qua non !

HEALTH BROKEN AFTER AN
OPERATION.
Sydney Woman so weak that She Could not
Walk—Nervous, Languid, Depressed-
Friends Recommended Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, which Cured Her.
“About two years ago I underwent a very
serious operation,” said Mrs. Nellie Newnmn,
who has lived at 3 Bishop Street, St. Peters, for
the past fifteen years, where she is very well
known and highly respected. “ After that my
general health broke down. I was so weak that I
could not walk. I could do nothing but lie about
all day. My nerves were very much affected and
I was always languid and depressed. I had no
appetite and the little food I ate seemed to do me
no good. I was under doctors’ treatment for some
time, but I didn’t get any better. Through a
friend I tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
People. By the time I had taken about six boxes
there was a great change in my health. I was not
half as weak as I was, and my appetite was very
much better. My nerves were also much im-
proved. I went on taking Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills, and after finishing ten boxes in all I was a
different woman. I was never nervous, tired, or
languid—l took a new interest in life. My health
is excellent and my appearance has improved
considerably.”
By steadily building up the wasted system with
good, new blood, and supplying fresh vital energy,
l)r. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have
cured hundreds who could not regain their
strength after an acute illness ; also sufferers from
anaemia, rheumatism, sciatica, eczema, indiges-
tion, muscular weakness, neuralgia, St. Vitus
dance, paralysis, etc. Sold by all medicine dealers,

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, February 25, 1908.
My Dear Arint,—
Ethel Turner has been looking at a map of
N.S.W.. and considering in her heart the inhabi-
tants of such places as Mickeybymulga, Mowabla,
Burrapine, and scores of other towns and town-
ships whereof the names are as strange-sounding
to us as if they were located in Darkest Africa.
She has seen with the eye of the imaginative the
lives of,, girls living in such lonely centres, and
heard with the inward ear their talk—nothing
but weather, sheep, and rabbits. And the
result of her consideration is a letter to the
Guild Gazette, the tiny organ of the Girls’ liealm
Guild. The writer suggests that the Guild girls
write once a month “a bright and newsy letter
to some unknown girl.” Plays seen, books read,
journeyings, flutterings at bargain counters, and
commentaries on hats and cats and cookery. The
girl at Boolagabilly, sitting on the step of her
father’s corrugated iron shanty and gazing out
beyond the kind of landscape our artists never
paint, would read these chronicles of a fuller life
with more or less amazement, according to her
mental outfit. That is, of course, if the letter was
“ bright and newsy.” Most of the persons who
have perpetrated the grand tour have absolutely
nothing to say about it. They are not bright,
neither are they newsy. One girl of my acquaint-
ance, who has been travelling for three years, has
no retrospective small beer to chronicle save these
two pints of ale: “Isn’t it funny that I should
get freckled and sunburnt in Norway and not in
Australia?” “At a hotel we stopped at in
Berlin the butter used to come to table moulded
as rabbits.’’ If this girl gets into the “Guild’s
Welcome Letter League,” (so Miss Turner
suggests it be named), she will most likely write
this kind of causerie : —
My dear Miss Baekofthebeyond,
I want to be one of those to bring a little brightness
into your hideously dull and ugly life. I, understand
from some of the Australian stories I have read that
you girls on selections haven’t quite as good a time
as the kine that bleat in your sheepfolds. It’s
dreadfully rough on you, and you must often be glad to
remember (when snakes come into your one-roomed cot-
tage, and your only drinking water is full of dead and
dying live stock, and several nests of ants have overrun
the corn beef) that there is a Hereafter, with a happier
and fairer landscape. When you reply to this you must
let me know if lam writing over your head. You know
what that means, don’t you ? Something too difficult for
you to understand. lam going to give you with my pen
u glimpse into the seething life of the metropolis, also a
synopsis of the books I read and the plays I see, and any new
cookery recipes I meet with. A charming book I took
back to the library to-day is—l hope you’ll forgive me,
but it’s name has escaped me. But it has what I like, a
happy ending and a clever man with grey eyes. You
must tell me if you like grey eyes and happy endings.
There are five women and girls in the book, and a canary
and the most marvellously clever and faithful watchdog,
who carries a lantern in his teeth over the snow, barking
all the way to let his master know he’s there. The
writer—l have forgotten his name—does know how to
frock his women. There’s one description of a tea-gqwn
you’d just rave over.
At the Royal just now a classical play is running.
Unfortunately I’ve mislaid my programme, and cannot
give you its name. But I think it is “ Cambrian,” or
something that sounds like that. Julius Knight .wears
cameos on the top of his socks and shoulders, and Ola
Humphrey, as Adelaide, or some such name, looks like a
young draped palm. Please don’t think I mean that she
looks like one of those dreadful conventional potted
palms wrapped in art muslin that they put on the edges
of concert platforms. She calls Mr. Knight, who takes
the part of Columbia—l think that’s the name—
“ Master,” but that doesn’t mean that she’s a “ general ”
or a parlor-maid. In fact, she’s not in his service at all—
it was just a form of address in those days before
the Norman Conquest. I like it. I like cere-
mony and good breeding. We have not got enough of
it, don’t you think? Of course you have no opportunity,
but here in Sydney we have, and don’t practise it. The
very smartest girl I know—a real society girl—says,
“Good-bye, old Rubbish,” to the man she’s engaged to)
I suppose it’s no use giving you a recipe for an oyster
cocktail. You can’t get oysters, but no doubt you can
get eggs, so enclosed find an afternoon-tea cake recipe
for twelve eggs. If you haven’t got the Madeira wine,
any kind of liqueur will do as well.
The new millinery is very large and heavy—and so is
the price. My friends say I describe millinery very well.
Do you think so? You, I suppose, wear a sunbonnet, or
make your own. Lucky girl! I often wish I might lead
the simple life. If Igo on at this rate you’ll know as
much of Sydney as I do myself.
“A truce to jesting” as they say in mellow-
drama. The livening letter is a capital idea,
provided the letter is properly written and not
insufficiently stamped; and if you want to get
into correspondence with some lonely girl in town
or country, write to Miss Burrows, the secretary
of the League, saying you are willing to cor-
respond. Enclose an envelope, stamped and
addressed to yourself, and Miss Burrows will
give you the name of the solitary Mariana on the
moated selection. You’ll get tired of the business
in a month and drop it in two months, but while
it lasts you won’t be quite so dead as you look,
and the lone girl on the moated selection will be
brightened up by her efforts to find out what sort
of a lunatic you are.
The Limerick craze, which has worked on the
brain of Sydney all this summer and made it
madder than much learning, is all but extinct.
No one committed suicide through failing at
limericking, as did a man in London. But every-
one you met tried for the big winning line, and
consequently everyone but one was disappointed.
And scores of persons who had tried lived in fear
that they would win only a ten-shilling prize, and
their names and addresses being published, their
friends would point derisive fingers at them.
When I took the cake—to the extent of £36 odd—
for a world-shaking line of Limerick doggerel,
my friends rained congratulations and flattering
post-cards on me; but when I was awarded a three-
shillingprize by theMosMAN Microbe, every friend
I had arose and jeered at me. and begged me not to
spend it all at the same place. Limerick-winning
is like beer, or murder. If you retail beer, you
are barred by society; but if you disperse it
wholesale from a brewery, you’ll be given a
knighthood or a peerage. Similarly, if you do a
heap of murder, you are a Napoleon ; and if you
do a little of it, the evening paper publishes a
picture of the scene of the tragedy, with X to
show where the body was found.
Francie Adler, who made good in Lucia at
La Scala (Milan, Italy) the other day, is prettier
as to face than the average grand opera singer.
Francie’s curly brown hair, dark Asiatic eyes, and
perfect complexion were- items which stirred the
gilded youth of these parts to wild joy and emu-
lation six years ago. Then someone uprose, and
said Europe ought to have a chance of gazing on
the charming details, the while it listened to the
Adler voice. And —as this particular appreciator
had the lucre which accompanies many flocks and
herds—it was so shortly afterwards. Francie’s
weak point lay ever in her figure, which tended
to embonpoint— not to say plain, daily fat.
By latest accounts the march of time has not
checked the march of flesh, and Francie has
become a very plump nightingale indeed.
I once asked a girl who knew Adler “ What is
she like off the stage?” and got the reply, “In
bed she looks the sweetest thing I ever saw—her
complexion, her crinkly, curly hair, and big
brown eyes—oh.” A shocked British matron in
a recent novel exclaims “ Who wants to look
pretty in bed ! ”
What a difference between Melba’s going hence
four years ago and her leave-taking this trip ! One
who stood on the wharf at Fremantle (W.A.) on
the former occasion tells me that not a soul but
himself seemed to know that she was on board
the liner tethered at the pier. Nary a body came
down to say “ Aufwiedersehen ” or “tena koe,”
or any such. When she departed from Mel-
bourne last Week a thousand women regretfully
sang her off the premises of the Southern city.
One of the sweet remembrancers (as Macbeth
says) that Melba carried from this city was a book
got up by Mr. Southwell, and containing all (or
nearly all) the newspaper notices and pars con-
cerning her published during her stay. A few
snapshots of the lady were cunningly introduced—
Melba watching the surf-bathing at Manly;
Melba speaking to a Governor or a newsboy, and
such like. Some Australian wildflower paintings
gave further variety, and the book was bound by
John Sands in butterfly hide, or bird of paradise
pelt, or something as artistic and beautiful.
Melba’s advice to sing-
ers about to go to London
is “Don’t.” It has fallen
on unheeding ears. It
never did apply to any
but the other girl. All
who sing know that the
other girl’s voice isn’t
worth expensive training.
A bunch of young singers
are going Europeward
this year, each feeling
very sorry for the rest.
To-morrow, at the Aus-
tralia, a meeting will be
held to sort out the details
of a concert to be given
bv Miss Gwen Duffy and
Miss Josie Miles, on April
2. Pirst is a soprano,
second a contralto. Chief
Justice and Chieftainess
Darley are taking what
the daily press calls “a
deep and practical inter*
est ” in the warble.
That elf-like soprano, Miss Emily Marks, starts
the concert outbreak (for those who are about to
depart for further study) on March 19 at the
Centenary Hall. She leaves Australia for foreign
parts and further study soon after her concert.
While on the musical scale: Report says that
we have got back from Stuttgart, and the tuition
of Max Pauer, a pianiste of uncommon skill and
tenderness—Margaret Edson. She is a Sydney girl
and was a pupil of the late Sydney MosS.
Miss Edson wall prove her gifts at a recital at St.
James’ Hall on March 12.
Maoriland’s woman barrister, Mrs. de Costa,
who was Miss Ethel Benjamin, of Dunedin, has
started practice in Wellington. This Lady One
is said to look well in a wig, which fact no doubt
counts with the jury.
A daily paper interview of last week makes it
appear that Julius Knight designed the costumes
which his co-star, Ola Humphrey, will wear in
the coming “Zenda” production. This is a re-
flection on my more or less emancipated sex.
Does the leading lady exist these days who would
suffer a fellow-player of the male brand to plan
her costumes? I guess not. As a fact, Princess
Flavia’s gowns have been designed by Miss
Humphrey. She played the r6le with her own
co. in America some time ago, and knows the
costuming requisite for this particular royalty
from the hem of the court train up.
Miss Ola Humphrey is wondering who is her
double in this southerly-busted city. She was so
ill all last week that she became during the day
the prisoner of the Australia, and had to forego
“ Prisoner of Zenda’’ rehearsals, only arising at
night to play the love sick Byzantine maid and
go blind with joy at the sight of Julius
Knight’s calves and countenance. Yet several
persons have told her they liked the
frock she wore at the Test match. The
seven weeks of dense, moist heat, through
which Miss Ola played the Lady Blakeney r6le,
in robes as hot as horserugs, and wigs that fried
her shapely head like the doorstep of Sheol, ex-
hausted the actress and compelled her to take
lying-still exercise.
Talking of the Test match : Cricketer Braund
is here with two smart little Melbourne women
and their husbands, and the collective eye of the
hostel where they are staying is frequently
directed under the table where the party sits.
Since “ Wallace telegraphy ” came to be a jest*
even like the mother-in-law joke, and the nigger-
and-chicken gag, and the wild mirthfulness about
the father who chases his daughter’s best boy off
the premises, men with long legs have a miserable
cramped time when dining in public with
women friends. They have to keep their hind paws
tucked under their chairs. And if they do uncoil,
and their patent leathers chance to touch even the
leg of the table, let alone another human foot in a
Louis shoe with a paste buckle, they either apolo-
gise profusely or get such a rush of hot-red-eti-
quette to the head that the waiter hurriedly drops
ice down their necks.
Miss Florence Young, who is looking very well
on her “ poisoned throat,” goes into hospital this
week to have the wrong righted. A singer must
feel a catch of fear at the heart when her throat
goes back on her.
From Bournemouth, England, comes news of
the death, on January 11, of Jane, widow of
Donald Larnach, of Brambletye, Sussex. She
must have been a very old lady. She was the
daughter of William Walker, of Lower Fort-street,
Sydney, merchant and shipowner, and sister of
Thomas Walker, of Concord. She married
Donald Larnach, then of Thomas Barker and Co.,
merchants, Sydney, in 1844. After marriage,
they lived in Cumberland Plhce on the Sydney
Rocks, and later on in Lower Fort street. Mr.
Larnach became an exceedingly wealthy man, a
leading merchant and director of the Bank of New
South Wales.
All that Goulburn owns of youth and beauty
and chivalry and new millinery and plug hats
assembled at St. Saviour’s Cathednal, last week, to
observe the wedding of Miss Eliza Bell and Mr.
Henry Moses. There, in the spirit, if not in the
flesh, were countless swarms of Chisholms, a De
Lauret or two, various members of the clan
Moses, also Arnolds, Twynams, Ewan Frazers,
Badgerys, and Middletons in assorted lots. An
Archdeacon executed the mooring process with the
calm aplomb of an expert hand.
Dr. John Hay and Mrs., of Crow’s Nest, that
most desirable place at North Sydney, are going
hence by the Asturias—the new liner that arrives
here in a few weeks. The Hays came from Maori-
land, years ago, when they dropped into the
heavily-gilded Berry Estate hereabouts.
Sydney’s prize-widow, Mrs. Burdekin, and Miss
Burdekin-and Mrs. • Alec Hay, are also to be
departers by the Asturias, the liner on which you
may have a flat to yourself, and your name on a
brass-plate on the door.
A TRIO OF YOUNG SYDNEY MUSIC-MAKERS.
MISS MARGARET
EDSON, Pianist.
MISS G WEN D UFFY,
Soprano.
MISS JOSIE MILES,
Contralto.
Mrs. Lachlan Beaton, with her two children
and Miss Ruby Adams, left by the Grosser Kur-
fuerst on Saturday, in a howling gale, a rain of
flowers, and scores of genuine regrets from those
left behind.
Mr. and Mrs. Francis Foy left to-day by the
Nera for foreign but friendly parts. The adieux-
ing of the staff on the wharf interested even the
seagulls. They—the staff, not the seagulls—joined
hands and made a line as long as the liner, and
Mr. Mark Foy waved his orange-hued tie.
That showiest of show girls, Miss Ida Bernard,
who was with J.C.W., has been spoken by a pass-
ing yessel in London. She signalled that she was
playing a little turn in the Seymour Hicks Co.,
and was “ all well.”
Town Clerk Nesbitt has gone on his annual
holiday to Maoriland. The Blakemores —he is
general manager of the Great Cobar—have fled to
the Groper country, where the Golden Mile is.
Amongst our ‘‘distinguished ” visitors are the
Hon. Nigel Herbert, staying at the Union Club.
He is the second son of the previous (or fourth)
Earl of Carnarvon by his No. 2 marriage, and
consequently brother of the present or fifth earl,
which is confused when you read it, but the state-
ment can bear inspection better than you might
imagine. Mrs. Dhuleep Singh is rumored in
Sydney to be a sister of the visitor, but she isn’t.
Dhuleep married into quite a different herd of
peers. The Carnarvon family has property here,
and possesses a stake in the country.
Professor Dettman, who has the classics stool
at the Auckland (M.L.) University, is to marry
Miss Loder, a girl of Sydney. Bridegroom-elect
graduated at that institution.
A.M.P. Musical, Literary and Dramatic Insti-
tute had its annual moonlight excursion last week,
and managed it with AMPIe success. (That pun
is my very own. My dog doesn’t want it.) While
the boat was in motion the Institute’s orchestra
played jolly selections, mostly dances. While
the boat was stationary, a musical programme,
with such suitable gems as “ A Wet Sheet and a
Flowing Sea” and “Asleep on the Deep,” was
presented to a gratified audience.
“A Boy’s Delight,” one of the exhibits ready
for export to the Franco-British Ex. to be
opened in London in March, ought to help
the boy immigration, on which Dr. Arthur
is so keen. Every boy loves birds’-nesting
better than his own soul. That is if
he be the real thing—“the glorious human boy,”
to quote an old fatted fraud in Dickens. “A
Boy’s Delight ” is a water-color picture showing
60 birds’ eggs typical of N.S.W. Mr. J. R.
Wright, the painter, got his originals from the
Museum, and they range from the emu egg down
to that of the grass warbler, a tiny, mottled,
turquoise-green production. A nest of the silver-
eye’s eggs is included in the picture. One
feels one’s mind vainly groping for a suitablo
adjective to describe the fairy-like tints of
the shelly collection. The buzzard’s egg
is the most luscious shade of chocolate, with a tur-
quoise freckle. The eggs are grouped in a mass
against foliage and fern environment. Same
artist sends clusters of grapes like unto those the
spying Israelites brought back to Moses as a proof
of how good was the land of Southern Monaro
and how eminently fitted for a Federal capital
site. Of four pictures by Mr. A. Coffey
three- are scenes of savage grandeur in title
Blue Mountains—the mist-filled ravine, the
dizzy cliff with the purple air of evening
hanging like altar curtains from its verge, the
illimitable distances. These canvases are on
exhibition at the Technical College. Miss L. E
Booth, Miss G. E. Brow'n, and Miss N. M. Fori
syth, pupils at the Technical College, also send
work. An attractive item is a design for lace em-
bodying Australian fauna and flora.
“ The big-game hunter stands apart among
men”—thus a recent writer in The Bulletin
And to that I say approvingly—he does, he does
indeed. The British papers record the departure
from Khartoum last month on a lion-shooting
expedition to the Chilook country of Prince
Demidoff, a Russian. Demidoff is one of those
persons of blood and iron the par.-writer evi-
dently had in mind, who are sudden death to the
savage beast wherever found. He is the typical
big-game pursuer—a grim, stark man like Julius
Knight in “ Claudian,” capable at any rnomentof
rending a ravening jaguar to fragments with his
bare hands. He takes only one chef with him into
the wilderness ; and of under-cooks but six. His
personal bodyguard he has narrowed down to three
valets and two footmen. His friends are aghast
at what they regard as an exaggeration of the
Spartan idea ; but Demidoff is firm. “ Though it
be only for six months,” he is reported to have
said, “I will live the simple life.” The cham-
pagne is of a good vintage (Perrier Jouet ’B4), but
it is limited in quantity. Only the chief hunter
and his intimates will taste of it. Brandy
(Fine Champagne ’47) is to be the sole liqueur.
Yet there will be ample food and drink
for all. Eighty-four Egyptian-bred donkeys
have been requisitioned to carry, drag and push
the various eatables and drinkables without which
the party would find itself faint and languishing
in the presence of its prey. Later, it is thought a
proportion of those donkeys may come in useful
as lion-bait. A herd, posse or conglomeration
of camels humps the main destroyer’s bedstead,
flock mattress, tent and furniture, and sturdy
oxen bear his armory to the spot where the car-
nage begins. No details have been forgotten.
Iron cages wherein to sit and observe the browsing
man-eaters; grappling irons for the rapid climb-
ing of trees, Gatlings to train upon the lions as
they charge in force ;4.7 guns (“Long Toms” in the
vernacular) for distant shots at exceptionally large
lions; pea rifles for infant lions; strychnine,
dynamite, and prussic acid for the cowardly ones
that skulk in their lairs and refuse to come out
and join in the fun. Truly this brand of sports-
man is “apart among men.” He is a marvel.
There is nothing like him outside a pigeon club.
That smart little Maoriland monthly, the
Triad, suggests, apropos of Mrs. Clara Butt,
that the whyness of an English woman-singer’s
yearning to call herself “ Madame ” should lie a
question for a Triad competition. The prefix
ought to be left to French gentlewomen and to
the horde of fortune-tellers, clairvoyants, and the
like, who, 'whatever their nationality, advertise
that Madame Smudge, the infallible revealer of
the future, who knows what horse will win the
Melbourne Cup, and what shares will go up and
what will go down, can be consulted for Is. in
Bilker’s Alley.
Yours Affectionately,
AKENEHI.
What Women Want. There was once a woman
who undertook to make the women of her time beautiful
for ever. She did not succeed. She did not succeed in
being beautiful herself. Her dust has returned to the
dust of all vain boasters. Valaze won’t keep you beautiful
for ever ; but it will make your beauty outlast your
happiest anticipations, and probably win for you a beauty
you never realised you could possess. Not only does
Valaze give perfect health and freshness to the skin, but
it imparts a special something— je ne sais quoi— a quite
delightful lustre that adds distinction to the rarest beauty,
and makes the plainest woman comely and attractive ; in
jars 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d. Also persevere with the Valaze
Complexion Soap. Let no glittering cover or obtrusive
perfume entice you from your allegiance. It is the best
soap in the world. 2s. a cake. All preparations from
leading chemists, or direct from Mile. Rubinstein and Co.,

The current number of The Call, the
paper which has for its object “to awaken Aus-
tralians to realise that the defence of our country
is the duty of all,” has some very interesting de-
fence and military articles. The criticism of the
Government’s new defence scheme is sympathetic
and intelligent, and should interest all Aus-
tralians.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, February 24, 1908.
My Dear Yarrik,—
Melba departed—in tears and smiles, and a
heavenly devil of a hat—while the nightingales of
the women’s choir sang at her, and pelted the
Spencer-street platform with rose petals. All
Society swarmed the line of fire of the singer s
smiles, and common or garden public jumped the
barricades at the station and cheered. Mrs. general
“Bob” Power was well in the lead, and kept a
hold ort her lioness to the last. The elongated, grey
Prof. Peterson carried himself like a perpetual
note of exclamation, marvelling at his little choir-
conducting wife. The grey Janet missus was in
evidence, “ taking notice ” quite decidedly in the
gaiety of her frocking. The “ family did not
bombard the train, but farewelled quietly at
home. “Dad” was much upset at the parting.
“Dad” had his eightieth birthday last week and
the energetic Mrs. “Bob” Power gave a dinner
in his honor and as a farewell to Melba. Mis.
“Bob” also ran the Conservatonum girls fare-
well. She even hustled out the all-powerful Mrs.
Peterson in the hostessing. Mrs. George Chirn-
side hasdrifted away to Europe, where daughter
Aubrey is to be “ finished off ” in the most ap-
proved style, so her pretty face and hrenchy
frocking have been out of the later pictures.
There was deep and unbounded fury at Spencer-
street on Friday among ordinary passengers by
the Adelaide express—passengers who were not
Melba. The authorities refused to issue the usual
platform passes, and Jack, carrying Aunties
dressing-case and poodle, or Edwin, with a box of
sweets for departing Angelina, had to tip gor-
geously to even get on to the platform, lhen the
swarm's of gushing girleens who, unarmed with
permits, came with flowers for Melba, made tar-
gets of the Charon of the Gates when their
thruppence for a platform ticket was refused.
Baw one maiden stamp her foot at the grim
guardian. Another drew up her few inches and
pouted, pettishly, “ But Melba sent for me ! At
them all the gateman gazed unseeingl.y, and
checked the tickets of exasperated travellers.
One of the Saturday morning spectacles of deep
interest was Melba’s local male adorer. Instead
of whirling through the noonday city in the Melba
motor-car, and basking in a radiance suitable to
Phoebus’ progress, he was carried lunch-wards on
a lamentable tram beside a charwoman. Which
is invariably (at least figuratively) the lot of all
who sit at the feet of great people.
Every Test Match—every big show at the
M.C.C. ground—raises a fresh howl about the
catering in those underground tunnels. Lunch,
afternoon tea, anything wet —they are all
alike elusive. There are tables and chairs (if you
are good at grab), and there is one waiter out for
fifty. Ladies by themselves have no hope of being
Served ; they must have a man, and a warrior at
that. Belisarius might have failed to get a square
feed at the M.C.C. premises, though he could do
most things. To break through the thirsty,
seething, surging wall that breasts the bar, and
rescue the tea from Sunday-school picnic boilers,
is a bigger job than taking a walled city. The
knight then braves despoiling by jogging
elbows, and, with luck, lays the trophy of cake
and tea at the feet of his waiting lady. The lady
risks all the fresh crispness of her best muslin
tuckers in the oblation to Thirst, and her Johnny
pays as much as for a dainty spread at
Menzies’ or the Vienna. There is not the excuse
of an occasional rush. This happens always.
There is a big swagger crowd ; there is a gigantic
Thirst; the badly-managed tunnels are the only
oases in the desert.
Caulfield, green and spruce and freshly painted,
had for its Saturday meet a Governor or so, and
a strong wedge of Western-Districters, otherwise
a rather sparse crowd. The frocking was quite
picnicky; returned seasiders mostly wore their
best-laundered linen and their sunburned noses.
The Northcote lady was very cheerful with a good
healthy motor-tan on her cheeks and a white
headlight of a rose on her purple hat. Purple was
so dominating a color that the lawn looked like a
gigantic anemone bed. Purple veils swathed
everything. Rita Riddle, that restless sheep-
burdened maiden who jaunts abroad again in
March, wore white roses on a purple hat to shade
the pale oval of her face. Mrs. Squatter Fenley
fairly shrieked with slashing stripes of purple and
mauve, and the metallic green plumes that waved
from her hearse-like hat.
The little Fenner girl, in soft lilac, kept shyly
under the wing of Mrs. Currie, in the absence of
her adored Mrs. Raleigh. Mrs. Norman Brookes
trotted out an amazing lace Empire frock, with a
hat like a Japanese parasol. An adorably-gowned
woman was Mrs. Leslie McDonald. The horsey
Leslie was in cheerful evidence also. A Frazer
girl garbed herself in soft powder blue from tip to
toe, and made a smart poster effect.
Wealthy widow “Port Phillip” Durant clad her-
self in Burgundy—breezy floating crepe shimmer-
ing over white silk—and her hat dripped with
winey plumes. Mrs. Vallange and hubby chaper-
oned’ the dimpled Ruby Madden and Colonel
Campbell (not that the jovial Colonel needed
guarding). Miss Ruby seems none the worse for
her Wanganui (M.L.) starving, and is one of the
few summer jaunters to hold fast to the dazzle
of unbought complexion. Mrs. Important Grice
hobnobbed with Vice-royalty, and wore striped
silk and a hat that did not matter much.
The railway Tait lady garbed herself in grey and
crowned her classic head with lilac bloom. She
and jaunty hubby have just returned from sea-
siding, leaving the Bud behind. The younger of
the Jackson girls spruced about in black-and-
white-check trappings, and trailed the nebulous
whispery haze of an unannounced engagement.
Most prominent of all on lawn and stand
was the beautiful Incognito—a visiting maiden
with an Air, who roused an amazed query
wherever she passed. The girl is a Du Maurier
beauty ; she seems to wear all. and always, purple
or minor shades of mauve, and totes round
an apparent sister, who is roundly pretty,.and
backs up the Beauty’s coloring. The Mystery,
clad in a misty vision of mauve, reigned in Her
Majesty’s circle to watch “ Hurnpty Dutnpty” on
Saturday night. Her favorite color matches the
pansy purple of her eyes.
Fred Beard inaugurates a new orchestral
series in a few weeks. And this town, in con-
sequence, is going to hear, for the first time, a
round dozen of the world’s great symphonies.
With the orchestral works we’re to have some
choral music sung by the new festival choir. In
short, if Prof. Frederick fulfils even a part of his
delightful promises, we’re going to get ahead of
the rest of this Commonwealth, and become the
cultured It. Of course, we will also have the usual
Marshall Hall and his familiar repertoire, the
Melbourne Quartette with its chamber-music,
and the minor societies with their well-intentioned
efforts. Last year the painters of three States
held carnival here amongst our money-bags, and
left us their testimony that we’re the most artistic
community they could reach by a train journey.
Now we’re going to make music our seasons
hobby, and centre upon ourselves the envy and
admiration of the universe. Aren’t we justifying
Mrs. Melba’s enthusiastic guff? Wont glory
accrue to us ?
But, apart from these more picturesque con-
siderations, a strong personal feeling is working
this improvement in our supply of melody.
Marshall Hall has reigned until he has grown
despotic. Mrs. Wiederman has thrust too many
ambitious but indifferent soprano vocalists upon
our artistic patience. The Germanic rule * ias
irked, and we hereby revolt and cast off our
allegiance to William Caesar.
The Vienna Cafe has passed into the hands of
a successful Dago purveyor of the bun and tea.
And, after twenty years, that wise Miss Shepherd,
beloved of three generations of convivial souls,
withdraws her guidance from the epicurean feeder,
and sails off to England. The good-humored
Shepherd gets a bediamonded crook, or some
trifle of the sort, from the flock whose pasturing
she has superintended so tactfully and long.
Mrs. Eugenie Anderson and his managerial
self leave for the Land of Disengaged Actors early
in March. The tragedienne threatens to act in
London.
On dit that Mrs. Wallace goes abroad, and takes
a stage billet this year, when the proper season of
widow’s weeds has dragged its slow length into
the opaque past. Also that Mrs. Ernest Luke
returns to the scene which saw her beauty in its
girlish hour, as a large actress with a small part in
“ Miss Hook of Holland.” Also that Mrs.
“ Thistle Anderson ” Fisher enters upon a lectur-
ing tour “to women only.” “ The Necessity for
being Bohemian,” “ The Maintenance of Merri-
ment,” and “ How to get Stared at, ’ are a few
subjects suitable for her exposition.
The Asturias has an entertaining cargo aboard
on its first trip. It includes the J. C. William-
sons, George Castles, the Newbury concert crowd,
the McEacharns, the Howard Berrys, the Spencer
Bruntons, and a big batch of Sargoods. Also the
Earl of Meath commences on an itinerary which
will include this happy country, where some
hundred thousand children are encouraged in
Jingoism at his instigation. Likewise there are
about another hundred of well-known and more-
or-less popular folks, who travel with less adver-
tisement, on the same vessel.
There are four answers to the runner lady’s
challenge. Sprinting enthusiasm has wakened in
the Melbourne she breast. St. Hilda Park,
which sees so many curious things, is in vaded in
the early mornings and on moonlit nights by
flitting shadows of girl runners testing their paces.
Every man in training down St. Hilda way has to
put up with a girly challenge for a “ test” now-a-
nights.
Alderman Burton’s son Edgar concludes he
will face matrimony with Miss Blee, a pretty
little Melbourne girl, now in Westralia. That’s
one of Melbourne’s most genial and sociable of
bachelors out of the lists.
Has Bent the Rotund started a kindergarten, I
wonder ? Saw the curved one in a huge motor-car
with a lady and quite a dozen children. Some
hung out of windows, some huddled in a de-
lighted heap, and others embraced the broad
shoulders of the lordly, lolling host.
Clever little Ida Rentoul has illustrated a
“ Humpty Dumpty ” story-book (probably for Her
Majesty’s), thatjjs selling like hot cakes. This
girl designed the shell-like dresses in the
under-the sea ballet for the panto. One set of
dresses—an impression of surf on greeny-blue
breaking waves —-is fine. Miss Rentoul cannot
go wrong with child studies, and anything touch-
ing on fairy lore.
Tea, talk, and prayers at St. Mark’s, Fitzroy,
to welcome back Evelyn—the Rev. Evelyn Snod-
grass, brother of Janet M rs - But what about the
Rev. Evelyn Snodgrass Douglas l The rev. went
to England solely for the purpose of claiming the
family name Douglas, and having it attached to
Snodgrass with much pomp. However, just the
Rev. Evelyn Snodgrass has returned with no
mention of Douglas, and it really looks as if he
would have to try to get to Heaven as just Snod-
grass. Anyhow, what’s wrong with Snodgrass ?
Miss Janet Snodgrass married a millionaire and
a title, and Mr. Evelyn secured the parish of
St. Mark’s. Now a niece. Miss Rose Snodgrass,
comes along and secures the position of matron of
the Beeehworth Hospital after a few years of
folding bandages, counting sponges and recording
pulses, much to the heartburning of ministering
angels with much longer experience.
Mrs. Elizabeth Pinschof is booked for Eng-
land and foreign parts, and Miss Wertheirn
accompanies her. Miss Carmen remains behind.
But she hopes to go later with the Baron and
Baroness.
There is a curious whisper that the charges laid
against a certain Anglican “priest” are inspired
by a High Church-Low Church feud ; and parti-
sans are making all sorts of strange allegations,
about a Delilah person’s wilful temptation of a
holy man.
Cabled all the way from London that Miss
Valaze Rubinstein has taken Lord Salisbury’s
London house, and opens it to-day as a Beauty
Parlor !
Probably the most gruesome tale Melbourne
has yet produced is that of Mrs. McLean, of
Malvern—the Old Woman who Died. She was
very ancient and bedridden. Her daughter was
the only nurse she would allow on the premises,
and that patient slave never went out, and often
slept in her clothes to be ready to answer calls at
all hours of the night. Possibly this sort of life
made her begin to “see things ; anyhow, whe ni
the old woman died the daughter concluded that
she was in a trance, or wanted to be left alone, or
something. For how many days she tip-toed
about the house for fear of waking the dead no
one really knows. Apparently for the last three
days she forgot to eat anything, and—well, there
are all the elements of a line horror in the
narrative.
The gorgeous civilian Hoad youth rushes madly
round town, and the heliotrope and green bars on
his socks twinkle with his haste. He, makes
ready for more Fog jaunt, but “ takes in bouth
Africa on his way, and climbs round by Cairo and
the Buluwayo railway on a mysterious mission.
Blakos Marathonopoulos, who went to Athens
for the big hoof races in '06 —and who is just plain
Irish George Blake, of Melbourne suburbs—goes
off to foot it in the 26-miles race between Windsor
and London, and is being farewelled furiously by
the youth of his seaside suburb, Ihe Blake
family boasts half-a-dozen sons, all top-side
athletes.
The almost impossible has happened. The in-
separable Tooraketty McLeod girls, of double
gush and wealth, have separated for the nonce.
Isey chatters her lively way about Hobart,
and the pretty, dark-eyed sister jaunts to
Colombo. A Vienna Cafe after-theatre supper-
table will probably cloud its gloom in sable
drapings.
The Women’s Choir of the late Exhibition is
not to be disbanded, but there is a sorting out of
the white doves. The little Peterson conducting-
lady is hard at work re-testing voices. ihe
numbers will sift down to about 400, probably,
and the combination will concert occasionally to
keep itself financially alive.
From “Rosna” the Crow-eater :
The Bishop’s Court infant was christened Ursula Mar-
garet, and there was a frilly reception, to which the very
Elect were bidden. Adelaide’s present Bishop and
Bishopess are rather quiet folk, and not very great on
functions. Still, it was a very nice and proper christen-
ing, and Ursula Margaret s robe was a gorgeous thing.
The Colonel Lees are getting ready, with much sound-
ing of the loud timbrel and the psaltery and the shawm,
for the return from Europe of their daughter. She has
been absent from the paternal nest for nearly three
years.
The gilded and initiated have been prophesying a more-
than-ever-deadly-dull season for South Oss, because her
Ex. is in mourning, and no one of any pretensions could
think of starting the social whirl without an Ex. to show
the way. Finally, however, came the announcement that
both Exes, would bestow their presence at the first
Melba concert, and things began to look up. , Perhaps,
after all, as it’s her last year among us, Lady Le Hunte
will continue to wave a kindly hand at our bazaar-open-
ings and other functions of national importance.
Unless the world came to an untimely end or anything
(and I daresay you’ll have heard about it, if it did), Melba
warbled to a thronged Exhibition barn on Saturday
night. But the pious absence of Sunday trains and the
unfeeling conduct of The Bulletin printer prevent my
giving any- definite information on the subject.
The Cattle-King Kidman family- is setting off shortly
to girdle the globe, just by way of dispersing some of
its superfluous shekels. The Kidmans sail by- the new boat
Asturias, on which they have engaged a suite of rooms to
protect them from the common herd that doesn t own
any cattle.
Just returned from a globe jaunt are Surveyor-General
Strawbridge, his wife and girls. They spent a jolly time
in Britain, strolled over the European continent, and
wandered into America on the way home.
Madge Mclntosh has dumped down her frocks and
frills at the South Australian, and this populace began by
trying to break the overcrowding laws in the endeavor
to get a glimpse of her. (The Anderson management is
just now being prosecuted because the same populace was
determined to see “ The Squatter’s Daughter,” even if it
had to cling to the rafters in the attempt.) Miss
Mclntosh didn’t strike her Adelaide audiences stiff with
admiration at first glance, but she’s growing on us, and
it’s probable that we shall soon be unable to live without
her. Still, chief local interest in the company circles
round Miss Florence Bosley, who is, in private life, Mrs.
Bosley Jenkins, w-ife of an Adelaide sharebroker. It is
such an opportunity for her dearest friends to tear her
acting to shreds. In “ Her Love against the World,
Miss Bosley lives up to her reputation for glorious
chiffons, and wears an evening coat that ought to hurt
her enemies very much.
Mr. Algernon Sidney- Clark, who died last week, pro-
vided a little work for our crematorium, to prevent it
rusting on its hinges. Mr. Clark had a paternal interest
in the “Creamery,” being secretary- to the Cremation
Society. He was also a shining luminary of the
Philosophical Society, and deeply interested in all manner
of deep and occult sciences. He was a brother of the late
John Howard Clark, who scattered scholarships over our
University with such a liberal hand, and at one time
edited the Register.
Talking of education, Mr. George Murray has lately
thrown £lOOO with a good aim at the Varsity, to found an
Imperial History Research Scholarship. It is to be called
the Tinline Scholarship, in memory of his mother’s people,
and in order that the necessary books for study may be
forthcoming, the Public Library has gone out in the high-
ways and by-ways seeking all available works, maps, and
charts dealing with Australia’s early history.
There’s an outbreak of connubialitis among Adelaide
pressmen. Recent marriages include those of Frank
Bonython (’User), Godfrey White (late ’Tiser, now
chief sport on West Australian, Perth), Harold
Johnson (also ’Tisjer). Staff of the other daily
is mad at these beats, and is hurriedly engaging
itself to many different girls. Results so far are
beyond expectations, and approaching alliances include
Geoff. Thomas (son of RKGiSTER-owning family), Hadrian
Moody (sporting editor, Register), Teddy Parish (more
Register), Teddy Boland (still more Register).
Yours affectionately,
JOHANNA.
Salv’army “General” Booth’s anti-suicide
club had an effective advertisement last week,
when a man killed himself in the chief Booth
institution in Sydney.
The Girl with a Story has broken out in a
fresh place in S.A. Criminal Court. On Sept. 6
she brought home a young man, and said she had
just married him. On Sept. 16 she gave birth to
a child which was admittedly not his. In January
she accused him of having fixed up a mock mar-
riage in the back-room of the Town Hall to deceive
her, and of having altered a certificate of a former
marriage of his, also to deceive her. The cer-
tificate certainly was altered—name, date, place
and everything else—but as soon as the Judge saw
it he declared that the alterations were obviously in
the girl’s own writing. A jury that was almost too
astonished to stand on its feet discharged the young
man unanimously, but there are about a dozen
unsolved mysteries in the case still. What was it
all about, and what was the purpose of it ?
iNobody has the ghost of an idea.

Arthur Leplastrier, of Sydney, recently treated
himself to a tour of the world, and, 'keeping hiseyesonen
on the way, discovered that High Speed Steel is almost
exclusively used in Britain, Europe N and America. Hich
Speed Tool Steel has revolutionised engineering machine
work, and enabled the machinist to practically double
his output. It was introduced commercially to the world
by the huge Sheffield firm of Jonas and Colver, Ltd. and
the firm improved upon it time and again till to-day a
steel known as “ Novo ” is generally acknowledged as
about perfect. The U.S.A. have a practically prohibitive
tariff, and importations of steel, with one exception have
been annihilated. That exception is “ Novo,” the im-
portation of which is increasing by leaps and bounds.
Arthur Leplastrier has made arrangements with the
Sheffield manufacturers to supply the markets of
Australasia.*
The Advertiser’s A.B.C. for 1908, issued by

what it will cost them to advertise their commodity in
the papers of the whole wide British Empire and the best
American and European papers. Office addresses, scales
of charges, circulations, and samples of the get-up ol the
papers are all given. In addition there are articles which
tell the inexperienced how to advertise on business lines
in order to secure business, and so forth. Brief accounts
are given of India, the self-governing States of the
Empire, and the colonial possessions. T. B. Browne Ltd.
is a huge advertising agency, and a full description of
how the big firm will look after the interests of adver-
tisers is well worthy of study by men who wish to push

282-4 George Street, Sydney (Box 1700)
The Inky Way.
“ Melb.” : Synopsis of Auld Lang S.vme : A Presbyterian
clergyman had three sons, George, Ebenezer, David. All
were educated for the ministry, but none would follow it
steadily. George and Eben did a little at it ; David did
nothing, though he studied in Germany, like Purves, the
barrister. David went to California, thence to Australia.
Ebenezer came here straight. Choke Brothers started
the Age in Oct., 1854. First number printed in the Exhi-
bition, where the Mint is now. Ebenezer was on the staff,
with Blair, Jas. Smith, and T. L. Bright (not Charles).
This Bright edited My Note Book later. Charles Bright,
apparently no relative, was yet later a superb Argus man.
The Age would have died but for the Eureka trouble in
December, 1854. Cooke Bros, were not pleased with the
editor’s politics. Probably, however, they cleared out
because not pleased with the profits. A co-partnery
formed of writers and other workers then ran the Age.
Ebenezer and David S.vme bought from this. Ebenezer
was elected M.L.A. in November, 1855, for the new Par-
liament of 1856. He died in 1860. David came fresh
on the Age at the time of purchase. He had
been on the goldfields, and wrote a good deal
in a Bendigo paper called the Diggers’ Advocate.
David was much in the background while Ebenezer lived,
and appears to have been only manager. Ebenezer
excelled as writer and orator. The Age seems to have
been saved by the Leader newspaper, Ebenezer’s special
hobby. David went by the nickname of “ The Contrac-
tor ” in the establishment, and was entirely under-
valued. Plugged on. His best writers were G. P. Smith
and H. J. Smith —“The Baker,” a slaughterous imitator
of G. P. Smith. Syme went to England in 1865-6. His
brother, G. A. Syme, editor of the Leader, took temporary
charge of the Age. The finances were difficult, through the
antagonism of the advertising element. There were three
morning papers, Argus, Herald, and Age. No evening
paper. All were 3d. Syme lowered to 2d. in 1867. and
soon to Id. This made him. The Herald sank into an
evening, paper. Syme bought it, and tried to work it
with the Age, transferring news matter. Hence the
“ Symese twins.” He quickly dropped this racket.
Thenceforward the Age sailing was plain. James Harrison
had been the able editor in the time of stress. He went
off upon meat-refrigeration. Afterwards the paper was
never well handled till Windsor came. He was con-
sidered a failure as Argus editor, though the Argus was
much more in accordance with his opinions.
Deakin, as a leaderist, was priceless. Pearson not so
valuable, but consistently useful. Hoare’s steady and
prolonged work came in. The Age obituary of Syme
is singularly reticent about his generals. Who
does it mention ? After all, Napoleon was helped
by his Berthier, Murat, Ney, Soult, and so
forth. Syme made few mistakes in judging
men. But he was ludicrously out when he wrote
down Graham Berry, about 1870, as “A Run-down
Dingo.” Or was this a random slash with which he did
not agree? Hardly. In his multifarious dealings with
journalists I only recall that he grievously misjudged one
man. This was Jardine Smith, who wrote leaders for the
Herald. Jardine Smith, the stone that David the
Builder rejected, became the most valuable stay and
buttress of the Argus.
Perhaps the most striking proof of the dominating
personality of the late David Syme was the fact that his
name actually overshadowed that of his paper. The man
in the street seldom knows anything about the pro-
prietors or managing directors of other papers, but the
Age and David S.vme were inseparably linked together.
Men in trains and trams frequently talked about Syme’s
policy— not the Age’s. “ I see David Syme has an article
on so-and-so this morning.” “ Yes, he’s giving it to them
pretty strong, too,” etc., etc. Quite a large number of
ignorant persons were under the impression that he wrote
the greater part of the paper himself, and individuals of
this class, with an imaginary grievance to ventilate,
would go to The Age office and demand to see David
Syme. Of course, they didn’t see him, but they would
generally order the reporter who interviewed them “ to
tell David Syme to put that in the paper,” and depart
with their delusion unimpaired. An Age man who was
reporting a small suburban political meeting one night
permitted himself to smile at a remark made by
one of the speakers. Instantly the speaker—a well-
known local celebrity—wheeled round and addressed the
scribe with great ferocity. “ I see the Age man laugh-
ing in the corner over there,” he roared; “ and
it’s only what I expected. I’ve never had
fair treatment from the Age, and I don’t ex-
pect to. I challenge the reporter to deny that him and
David Svme put their heads together every night, and
says, ‘ ’Ow can we deal it out to old Bill (the
orator) in to-morrow’s paper ? ’ ” Apart from his name,
however, Victoria’s,great newspaper proprietor was very
little known.

The Gilbert wit is not the dead thing its owner’s
acceptance of a knighthood would suggest. Black and
White, a British weekly, in accordance with the slushy
custom of-the country, wrote to various prominent people
asking their ideal New Year’s reform resolution. Gilbert
answered : “ Dear Sir, —A reform that I am particularly
anxious to see carried into effect is that editors would
cease to trouble busy people for gratuitous contributions.”

“ Skull ’’: I experienced great happiness at the out-
come of a recent squabble in the office of a metropolitan
weekly. The town had been full of divorce and rumors of
divorce, and one of the rumors concerned a conspicuous
family very nearly. Then it became known that wiser
counsels had prevailed, and that the shindy was over.
The proprietor of the weekly instructed his sub-editor to
convey the news to his readers with elaborate circum-
spection. The paragraph had to intimate that the scandal
was averted, but it must do it in such a way as not to
reflect however remotely on anybody, or even to hint at
the persons concerned. The sub evolved a par with much
brain fag. It was a fearful and wonderful par, full of
harrowing significance. Read it which way you would,
it hinted dark things, but all it said was that
right-thinking people would be glad to know
that any suspicions which might or might not have
been entertained in certain quarters on a subject that
need not be further specified, had now been dissipated,
through the arising of various circumstances about which
it was not necessary to go into details, but which reflected
great credit on all parties concerned. It was so beauti-
fully vague that a man who had accused another of keep-
ing a dog that barked at night, and hadn’t been able to
prove his case, thought it meant that his statements had
been shown to be quite false, and that the dog-man’s
character had been vindicated. And he was so angry
that he came to the office and hit the first person he met
with a bit of garden hose.

“Two Seas”: “Parkside” (B. 6/2/’08) on Cyril A.
Pearson reminds me that I met that cute gentleman once
in the early ’nineties. I was pursuing literature in London
and had some hopes of catching up with her if my wind
held out. I sent in a yarn to one of Cyril’s Cheap Chits
copper snatchers. Heard nothing about it until a chum
told me he had seen the title on a contents board. Inter-
viewed Cyril at once. Yes, he remembered the yarn, but
had only used half of it—the balance got mislaid. He
offered me a cheque for the portion used at the rate of
10s. per thousand words, and met my objections with a
query as to whether I thought it fair that he should pay
for the whole when he only used half. I asked him
another: If he were an artist and offered a picture to a
dealer for £5O, would he be satisfied if the dealer cut his
work of art down the centre, and lost one half, and sent £25
for the other half. Cyril admitted that he wouldn’t, and
paid up with the air of a duke. I may mention that the
rear portion of that belated yarn of mine appeared in the
following issue. Cyril, having paid for it, evidently
thought it a pity to waste it.

“Viator”: In the A.N.A. Exhibition at Melbourne
there was much gaping around a young lady, blindfolded,
who rapidly worked a typewriter. This isn’t a useless
accomplishment, like Burrows’club-swinging. In Ameri-
can business houses there is a high premium for steno-
graphers who can typewrite their stuff without looking
at the machine. In the U.S. Congress the stenographers,
who get £lOOO each per annum, never transcribe their
notes. They talk them into a graphophone. It is
worked by electricity, and will take in and give out an
enormous mass of stuff. It will start in a moment and
stop in a moment. The graphophone, with the steno-
grapher's talk thick upon it, is handed over to a type-
writer, who types the outcome. The reporter talk's in
quicker than the typist can take out, but here comes in
the facile stoppage. Of course, the matter in the ’phone
can be kept as long as you like. It is canned monologue.
Obviously this system must come for the relief of the
over-wrought Australian Hansard men.

TUB OLD CHIEF.
DAVID SYMS. Born 1827. Died 1908.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, saw ye ever our Old Chief that was so stern and grim ?
Or looked ye ever in his eyls that now are closed and dim ?
His glance was high, liis brow severe, his spirit none
might quell—
For what he sought he grimly fought despite of Heaven
or Hell 1
A mighty man was our Old Chief, and merciless and bold
As any mediaeval Knight, or Paladin of old ;
And though he lacked their courtly grace, he far excelled
their might
And fought a sterner battle —for he fought the People’s
Fight 1
No jot cared he for gentle jousts and dames of high
degree!
No Roland he, or Galahad—a star of Chivalry ;
In shining steel and shimmering plume with shield and
lance in rest
He never rode across the lists at Love’s or Fame’s behest.
He never struck the barbed ash-lance clean through the
foe’s gay shield,
Or swung the mace or battle-axe upon the stricken field ;
He never kept at any shrine weird vigil through the
night—
A wearier vigil far was his w'ho fought the People’s Fight!
He never sought the Holy Grail, or joined a mad Crusade,
Or, like Rinaldo for Armida, from his pathway strayed ;
He owned no gemmed Excalibur that glittered like the
sun ;
With more prosaic weapons all his splendid work w r as
done 1
No high, chivalric, futile deed of arms was his to do,
But in a long and dreary fight he battled gamely through :
The plaudits of the tournament which hailed the victor-
knight
Were never showered on our Old Chief w'ho fought the
People’s Fight.
From Beauty’s hand no crown of bays e’er decked that
grizzled head
Wherein the great campaigns ,to win the People’s Cause
were bred ;
No sword was lightly laid on him by king in armor
dight—
He never wore the golden spurs who fought the People’s
fight.
Yet at his beck and to his call there gathered in his train
A matchless troop of fighting-men, who fought with
might and main.
And he—so wise, so bold, so strong— he led them on the
foe,
And overth rew the ranks of Greed, and broke and brought
them low 1
The shock of fiery knight and knight, the thunder of the
charge—
The thud of battle-axe on helm, or sword-stroke upon
targe —
The roar of battle, and the crash of falling mail-clad men
Are gone ; hut still the fight goes on with Printing-press
and Pen !
The ranks of Greed and Privilege close round him in their
wrath,
But iron grim the Old Chief stands and hews his deadly
path.
They flee ! They flee ! . . . The fight is won and peace is
on the land.
But see, the Old Chief falls ! His sword drops from Ijis
lifeless hand.

Two Hundred and Sixteen
There are two hundred and sixteen reasons why you, if you are about
to purchase a piano, should obtain a Beale Piano.
Look at the four illustrations herewith. Start with No. 1.
You note those ro7/s of holes in the wooden wrest-plank of the imported
piano. When the piano is “ strung ” each one of those holes is filled
by a “ wrest-pin ” —a piece of steel shaped ;not unlike a blunt nail
without a head.
Each pin is a quarter of an inch in diameter. Each is driven into its
hole with a hammer —it must fit tightly, so as to resist the pulling-
round of the wire which is wound round it.
Each pin is therefore like a wedge in the wrest-plank, and when the wire
(or “ string ”) is tightened up by turning the pin round, and thus
coiling the wire upon it, each pin becomes in addition a lever , because
of the pull of the wire.
There are two hundred and sixteen of these pins. The total strain
exercised upon them by all the wires when at concert pitch
amounts to nearly thirty tons.
Remember that they are only held in a wooden plank.
No one can suppose that a single wooden plank, driven full of wedges,
which are also levers, can for long withstand such a strain.
Especially in a climate like the Australian.
Whence —see Figure 2. Now compare Figure 2 with Figures 3 and 4.
There is the whole story.
In the Beale Pianos those two hundred and sixteen pins are contained
entirely in solid iron.
They will v/ithstand indefinitely any strain that may be put upon them.

the timber has split under the strain of the wires. This is an average
wooden wrest-plank, neither better nor worse than is usually found in
imported pianos, ALL of which have wooden wrest-planks. And
consequently they are ALL subject to the above fault, which cannot
be remedied except at great expense.

It is important for

BILIOUSNESS,
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills Reach the
Liver as no other Remedy does.
Biliousness by its terrible effect upon the spirits
and energy of its victim, is one of the most dis-
tressing of common ailments. Usually preceded
by irregularity of the bowels, it is followed by
severe headaches and dizziness and total inability
to do anything whatever. Many medicines are
simply purgatives operating on the bowels only,
and having no permanent effect. Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills act directly on the liver,
cleansing the bowels and restoring the system to
its proper condition. Here is proof of what we
say :
“ I have great pleasure in stating that I owe
much to Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills,” writes
Mrs. Thomas Cross, of West Moree. “Twelve
months ago I was suffering very acutely from
liver complaint and a very severe cold, which led
to bronchitis. I was also greatly troubled with
biliousness, which would bring on purging and
retching. At this time a friend of the family,
hearing I was bad, recommended Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills. I procured a bottle and took
two pills regularly every night. Very soon I
noticed an improvement in my condition. My
cough became less troublesome and the .phlegm
came away from the lungs, and breathing became
easier ; I could eat better, my appetite returned,
and I increased in weight. I completely re-
covered, and now enjoy good health, which I
attribute to the regular use of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.”

Entries for coming Newcastle Cup are evidence
of how “ Tatt.’s” sweep fetches nomination and accept-
ance money. The list numbers 70, and will almost cer-
tainly remain intact till that “ bit to nothing ” has gone
round as far as it is likely to go ; then there’ll be consider-
able scratchings, and, possibly, not more than 20 will
start, Rosehill Cup (71 entries) is another case in point.

Cabled information of the death of the King’s
famous horse Persimmon, through an accident, recalls
that his was the first English Derby won by the seventh
Edward. Also that, four years later (in 1900), Persim-
mon’s brother) Diamond Jubilee, gathered the event for
the same owner. Three seasons’ racing saw Persimmon
scoop £34,706 in stakes. The horse went to the stud in
1898, and had remarkable success ; among his get was
Sceptre—bought for 10,000 gs. as a yearling. The first
season’s progeny won £2455, and the next year’s £36,868 ;
then followed successive annual accumulations of spoil :
£24,472, £10,308, £16,443, £21,737, and £12,815. Per-
simmon was 14 years old, and his fee was equal to a
N.S.VV. M.L.A.’s yearly salary—£3oo.
Australia hasn’t seen many higher class fields
than that which the allegedly infirm Antonio beat in
Caulfield Futurity Stakes on Saturday. Antonio’s present
owner, Mr. R. C. Allen, bought the nag in England some-
where about 12 months ago—discarded property, not
considered likely to be of value any more—for £3OO. But
that cripple and crock specialist, trainer Earnshaw, got
some magic in, and Antonio has been unplaced only once
in Australia in five starts. Of three English importations
that have annexed the Futurity Stakes, the latest
winner has had the biggest load (9st. 81b.). Sir Foote’s
was 6st. 101 b. and Playaway’s 6st. 71b.

Possibly the best rider that has left Australia
is apprenticed jockey J. Pike, who goes with Sydney
trainer W. Kelso this week. Pike’s brief connection with
the game has resulted in 39 wins and a dead heat; he
scored two wins and a dead heat at Moorefield last
Saturday afternoon. Said that money won by Kelso over
Pike’s mounts will pay expenses abroad of master and
indentured servant, and leave a substantial balance to sit
back on.

The Hunting of the Snark was not a circum-
stance to The Selling of the Crow at Broken Hill. The
Crow Was supposed to be something of a fiver in the race-
horse line, and Peter Assad, having developed a taste for
horseflesh, decided to make a start on the turf with The
Crow. The alleged owner of the steed appeared, and the
deal was, after trials, concluded, payment being made by
cheque. Then apparently it came on to rain, or The
Crow fell into the water supply, or something, for the
purchaser found that his new property’s mane, tail, and
feet had been dyed black, presumably to disguise the real
identity of the goods. Later on he also discovered that
the trials of speed had been faked, and that the furlong
posts on the racecourse had been shifted to enable the
dyed Crow to break records. He stopped payment of the
cheque, and the other party was foolish enough to sue
him. Hence the publicity. Meanwhile nothing seems to
have happened to the men who sold the tinted Crow—ex-
cepting that they have given away a horse.

Noteworthy occurrences concluding day (Satur-
day) of V.A-T.C.’s Autumn meet were the successes of
The Brewer (Alma Stakes) and Banzai (Woodcliff Handi-
cap), both only acquired by present owners last week.
W.A. sport, Mr. Bunbury, gave loOOgs. for The Brewer,
who cost 105 gs. as a yearling, and Banzai was bought for
500 gs. Each horse won a good race well, and beat a
strong field. Among those behind The Brewer was
Poseidon’s costly brother, Orcus, who again left all con-
cerned lamenting.

Last week the V.R.C., urged by the threatening
attitude of the Vic! Owners and Trainers’ Association,
and fearing Bent’s promised legislation, handed the
owners and trainers aforesaid a weighty stone in place of
the loaf they asked for. It was a polished piece of rock,
nicely wrapped in tissue paper and tinsel, but it
was quite indigestible mullock none the less. Briefly,
the big club decided to amend its rules so that a
pony may run on registered courses without the animal
or its owner incurring disqualification by reason of the
beast’s previous performances. (A pony for this purpose
is a horse under 14.2.) Of course this blessed concession
means nothing. It is no consolation to those owners
who want to race their horses at Ascot to know that they
may race their ponies at Flemington. Thus, the V.R.0.,
while professing to cater for ponies, refuses the entries of
horses whose owners have raced at unregistered meetings
—meetings, that is, which are unregistered by the V.R.C.,
but are as fully registered and legitimate as the big club
itself so far as the Gaming Act is concerned. Having
made this momentous alteration, the V.R.C. bogged in,
and decided to allow a jockey to back his mount through
its owner; it being notorious that the regulation pro_
hibiting the mannikins from betting is habitually flouted'
the club evidently thought this little concession would
persuade the jocks once more into the paths of pro-
bity and straight riding. Then the club abolished its
illegal demand for a £2 2s. annual registration fee from
racing clubs, and substituted one of £1 Is. where the
stakes are under £lOO, and £2 2s. where they exceed that
sum ; which notable “ concession ” about equals Trum-
per’s score in the fourth test match. The meeting was
about to conclude with enthusiastic votes of thanks
all round w'hen an ill-regulated horse-owner named
W. Reid rose and moved that the V.R.C. should
in future limit the profits of proprietary racing clubs
and individuals to 10 per cent, per annum, as is
done by the English Jockey Club, and apply the rest
of the profits to increasing the stakes. This proposal
knocked the meeting silly, but it recovered in time to
rush to a handy bar for a reviver. If the
Owners and Trainers’ Ass.—a fairly representative
body—will now keep on harrying Bent, it has a fair
chance of getting a measure that will create a genuinely
representative governing body for the State’s racing, and
will put the proprietary clubs and the V.R.C. in their
proper places, either as trading concerns whose profits
must be limited, or as public bodies catering for the
public’s amusement, whose concessions and emoluments
to members must also be strictly limited.
“Macota”: Another argument for the tote.
Just before the starting of the first race at the February
meeting of the Q.T.C. at Ascot (Brisbane), on the 17th,
the owner of the favorite in the big race of the day,
smote another owner, who at once reported the mat-
ter to the committee. The latter promptly held an inquiry
which extended over some time. In the meantime, the
first and second races had been run, and the saddling-up
bell for the big race, the February Handicap, having rung,
all the horses engaged in that race were out on the course.
Amongst them was the favorite. But just before the barrier
went up the horse was recalled, as its owner(and with him
the horse) had been disqualified for six months for the
smiting above mentioned. The tote paid back all money
that had been invested on the disqualified horse, but the
books (except one) held on to the cash.

Just as The Bulletin goes to press word comes
that the very shifty property known as the Sculling
Championship of the World is located in Maoriland for a
while longer. It has left us like a beautiful dream.
Trickett brought it to Australia in 1876, and
lost it again to Hanlan in 1880. It vanished
. like a bubble and went to America. Beach
recovered it in 1884, and brought it back to Australia
and tied it down. It remained anchored till Stanbury
lost it to Canadian Jake Gaudaur in 1896. George Towns
went away to Canada and wrested it from Gaudaur
in 1901, and once more got it hooked on to Australian soil.
Then he passed the championship over to a brother who
wasn’t a champion, and Webb came over from Maoriland
in 1907, and, wresting it from the nerveless grasp
of the younger brother, planted it in the slush of
the Wanganui River. Tresidder, after herculean efforts,
raised the stake money and went across to recover it.
But on the afternoon of Tuesday, February'2s, he was
beaten by four lengths. Australia’s chances of recovering
the slush (one can’t say “ ashes ”) of sculling look faint
and remote.

As usual, the Test Match is raging in an
interesting manner just as The Bulletin goes to press.
On Friday Captain J ones won the toss, and sent the Aus-
tralians to bat on a dirty wicket. They struck trouble at
once, the first wicket falling for 10, the second and third
for 46. Gregory’s 44 was top score, and Noble’s 35
next best. Trumper, whose display in the match
against N.S.W. suggested he had recovered form, went
down for 10, and the whole side vanished for 137. Then
the English went in, and at the drawing of stumps had
scored 116 for the loss of one w’icket, Gunn doing the
damage. Rain came down on Saturday, and the
English batted between the showers till 3 p.m.,
when the rain became an institution, and play was stopped
with three English wickets down for 187. On Monday,
the ground was horrible, and the English deliberately
played to get out as quickly as possible, and get the
Australian second innings started on a villainous wicket.
The Australians cursed, the crowd groaned and hooted,
but the Englishmen walked the runs to get out,
and departed for a total score of 281. Of these,
Gunn made 122, and carried his bat right through
the innings. However, the English did not profit by
their Napoleonic tactics, as the Australians made 18
without losing a wicket. On Tuesday the Australians
began to pick up. Trumper flashed into something like
his old form, making 166, while the score stood at six
wickets for 340.
* • * * *
George Gunn, like Maclaren, Hayward, and
other English cricketers who have visited Australia, has
a decided liking for the Sydney Cricket Ground. Gunn
came out on a health trip, and has built himself up to be
one of the soundest players in the team. In three visits
to the wickets on the S.C.G., Gunn’s scores have been
119, 74 (in the first Test), and 122 not out (in the fifth
Test).

In the cricketing for Melbourne Pennant
Premiership, last Saturday, one solitary century was
chronicled—that of Stuckey, who made 108 for East Mel-
bourne against St. Kilda. With Stuckey’s assistance,
East figured out at 300 for seven wickets, the other chief
contributor being Frank Laver, 43 not out. To Mel-
bourne’s 262 of the previous Saturday, South responded
with 317 for nine wickets. Smith (70), Jacobs (65), and
Kenny (68 not out) were the leading artists with the bit
of wood. Carlton, w'hich stood at 295 for eight wickets
last week, completed its innings for 307 and then
took the field against Richmond. Followed Richmond’s
demolition for 125, owing to a somewhat hazy notion
of the deliveries of Warne, the Carlton trundler. Warne’s
bag panned out at eight for 69. Richmond made another
attempt, but couldn’t raise anything but a diffident argu-
ment. The useful Warne again collared three for 48 out
of Richmond’s tally of five for 79. Hastings, Carlton’s
keeper of wickets, aided in the capture of five during the
day. Essendon’s 150 against North was remarkable for
the extreme inertness of the club’s tail. At one point
in the dispute, 143 for five wickets stood to the
Don’s account. The next four wickets, however, fell in
four consecutive balls without the addition of a run, and
that’s the tale of a catastrophe for which bowlers Bean
(2 for 1) and Carlton (4 for 44) were mostly responsible.
Northcote made 167 against Fitzroy’s previous compila-
tion of 240 for two wickets (innings declared closed),
while ’Roy’s second exhibition read five for 107. The one-
sided discussion between Collingwood and University
ended in victory for ’Wood by an innings and 103 runs.
’Wood’s answer to ’Varsity’s miserly 63 was a virile 270 for
eight wickets (innings declared closed), in which Ches-
wass (74), Brooks (65), and a person named Sundries (39)
were chief participants. ’Varsity’s second effort realised
only 104, the handy Fry (4 for 39) and Pitcher (4 for 21)
being the cream of ’Wood’s attack.

S.A. Cricket Association gave the Fiji team
only half the Oval to play on, with another match in
progress on the other half. (Certainly it is an immense
ground, and English captains now always insist on having
apiece roped off from each end.) Also a home side was
chosen chiefly of country players, with George Giffen and
Jack Lyons resuscitated for the occasion. Lyons did not
turn out; but Giffen did, and showed much of his old
form with bat and ball, and more than his old judgment
as captain. He kept himself back, in bowling, till Rees
and the much-boomed youngster Stirling had proved
quite ineffectual ; then he went on himself and skittled
the dark-skinned men out (6 for 58). Later, the veteran,
going in tenth for his side, put up a beautiful not-out 30
odd, placing the ball with perfect command. S.A. now
wonders whether Giffen’s usefulness in big cricket is
really over.

On his way to England in search of prize money
and any spare cash which may be lying about, Australian
champion runner A. B. Postle called at S’Africa, and
wiped the dust with Johannesburg’s champion, Arnold,
in a match over 75yds. and 120yds. Postle is more than
likely tj» keep the ’Roo’s tail erect in England in his pro-
fession bf fleetness of foot.

The Ladies’ Running Championship will be
contested in Melbourne some time during March, Mrs.

Geo. Blake, the Melbourne harrier, who repre-
sented Australia in the Marathon race at Athens, in May,
’O6, has been selected by the Victorian Amateur Athletic
Association to compete in the 26 miles race from Windsor
to London, fixed for July next. Considerable argument
was raised in favor of Aitken, the present 10-inile cham-
pion, who has pushed his truck forward during the past
season. However, if sufficient coin is raised, the A. A.
says Aitken can go along with Blake. Meanwhile, the
Australasian Amateur Union will be asked to nominate
the Victorian'boys as accredited Kangaroo representa-
tives. Aitken is a good, performer, but has neither the
age nor experience to warrant his selection, even if the
dollars are forthcoming. Writer prefers Rufus Fer-
guson, a seasoned all-round athlete, who bolted in
a three-mile Australasian track championship, and
did a similar trick in a Victorian 10-mile amateur
bike championship. Respite the strenuous efforts to pick
him up, Rufus never came back. Besides, Ferguson has
proved himself a top-notcher for Some seven years, and a
sound age is a big argument. Geo. and Rufus are a couple
of laps off thirty, and in an event like the Marathon the
seasoned man is the stuff. Will Sherring, of Hamilton,
Canada, who annexed the Athens affair, Was 29 at the
time, while Alfred Shrubb, climbing up in years, recently
kept a trotter moving some for 15 miles. Aitken’s
time will come. He’s merely 21 next May, so his
anatomy has yet to undergo a settling-down process.
Considering that Blake had only a three weeks’ prepara-
tion against Sherring’s three months in Athens prior to
the race, the Australian did wonders to lead the
field easily for 16 miles, eventually crawling home
sixth with cramps. It is not generally known that
Blake competed in a five miler, prior to the Mara-
thon, against 40 of the best, including Scotchman Johnny
McGough, w ho beat Shrubb, and Ragneneau, the French
wonder, credited with 11 miles 200 yards for the hour.
The first mile went by in' 4min. 31sec., and at 1£ miles
Blake was carving it out in front. Hawtrey (England)
took command, and eventually won in 26min. 11 4-ssec.
Blake finished sixth, about 120 yards away, having
covered the distance easily inside his own record made at
Malvern (Melbourne), October 6, 1900. Geo. ran in some-
one else’s shoes ; someone borrowed his and forgot to re-
turn them—it’s a way they have in Greece. “ The Greek
wine steals all heads, the Greek women steal all hearts,
and the Greek men steal everything.”

The management of the N.S.W. contingent for
the Australasian Athletic Championships’ meeting at
Hobart showed the usual slipshod methods. The meeting
commences on Saturday next, and the N.S.W. team
left Sydney yesterday. A sea voyage is not the best
preparation for strenuous athleticism, a fact recognised
by the Maorilanders, who had their team in Appleland a
fortnight ago and hard at work getting acclimatised.
* •* * » *
The Victorian A. A. A. is promoting a somewhat
‘ imposing athletic display on the 20th prox , in aid of
funds to send long-distance peds. Blake and Aitken
to compete in the Marathon race in July. The star event
is an out-for-keeps set-to with gloves between champion
Roy Ralph and Ballarat top-notcher Michell. Strong
man Clarence Weber, the muscular Porter Bros., and a
host of others will take a hand. Blake should make
things hum in the three miles Australasian Championship
at Hobart on Saturday.
The most interesting item in the six days’ bike
race at New' York was the awful amount of “ prog ” put
away by the riders. Rutt and Stoll, the winning team,
averaged 51b. of sirloin, 71b. of chops, and five chickens
per day. During the w>eek they also demolished a 101 b. bag
of rice, several pounds of oatmeal, one dozen pots of mar-
malade, and six dozen eggs. What they drank is not
mentioned, but their total food bill for the week was
£ll3. Fogler arid Moran, who ran second, ate six
chickens, 61b. steak, and 61b. of chops daily. During the
week they polished off a bushel of celery and many eggs
in sherry flip. Their thirst w r as considerable also, and
accounted for 24 bottles of Bass’s ale, three pints of cham-
pagne, and about a gallon of distilled w'ater daily 7. Con-
sidering what they ate and drank, the wonder is they
found time to ride.

N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union struck water with its
Australasian championship meeting, having three times
to postpone the struggle on account of the downpour
and the slippery state of the track. And, as usual, the
fourth attempt is being made on the night this paper
goes to press.

Prince Alfred Yacht Club had a day out on
Saturday last, running bff the contest for the Jenny
trophy and another for cruisers with the usual prize
money—five guineas, and the honor and glory. The wind
came from the south-east, and was spiteful, whirly and
sudden. It was one of these sudden gusts which caught
the Avvanui with all Its head sails loose, and compelled
it to luff to windward of the finishing buoy and drop
out of the race. In fact, it was the Awanui’s dull day
throughout, and Rawhiti held the usually speedy boat on
the wind with apparent ease. But the big yacht,
although excellently handled right through, failed to
overtake Mr. Cutler’s Kukuburra, which, with 23min.
start, romped home with 3min. 27sec. to spare.
In the cruisers’ handicap there was some pretty
navigation. It was a rough day for cruisers, and crossing
the Heads to and from Manly was like facing the in-
famous Bay of Biscay 7. Reefing was the order of the day.
The ex-Tasmanian yacht Nanoya, owned by Mr. T.
Marshall, flew a full sail and topsail, and tore through
the water. Some of the old Tasmanian crew were on
board, and so was Mr. Marshall, and the owner must
have felt that he had got on board of some species of
marine racehorse. He flew past the struggling opponents,
and at half-way was full seven minutes ahead of the
nearest opponent. He won by 11£ minutes.

On the last night of the Swimming Carnival at
Claremont, Westralia, on Wednesday week, Victorian
Beaurepaire met Cecil Healy on level terms in the 440yds.
championship, and beat him, not by inches, but by
10yds. And it was a mighty struggle. At 50yds.
Healy was in front by inches. At 100yds. he
was half a length to the good, and at this
stage Beaurepaire lost about 6yds. through colliding
with a Westralian. Then he came like a torpedo, shearing
through the water so fast that at 350yds. he was drawing
level with his formidable leader. He came up alongside
Healy, tore through the water level with him for a
while, and then forged ahead. At the turn he gained a
length, and shooting away won by the remarkable dis-
tance above mentioned. The time was smin. 28sec., and
the victory gives Beaurepaire possession of the Kieran
Shield for one year. Naturally, Beaurepaire’s brilliant
and unexpected victory over so great a swimmer as
Cecil Healy in the 440yds. championship of Australasia,
drove the Victorian Swimming Association wild with joy.
The Association unanimously decided that Beaurepaire
should go to London to the Olympic Games, and sub-
scriptions are invited for the purpose of defraying the
cost.
The same night saw Westralian champion
Matson break the world’s record for the 220yds. cham-
pionship. (Matson’s own previous time of 3min. 17sec.
was the world’s record.) Against Richardson (Vic.),
Finlay (W.A.), and Garland (N.S.W.), Matson swam very
strongly, and won by two yards from Richardson, with
Finlay third, thus reducing his own record by 3sec.
Garland retired at 75yds.

Sam Hordern’s new motor yacht, designed
by Mr. Walcer Reeks, and now being built at Balmain
(Sydney), is claimed to be the largest motor yacht afloat,
its dimensions being 110 x I7£xs£. The hull of the vessel
is constructed of Australian hardwood, and was built in
Australia. Unfortunately, Mr. Hordern is installing three
imported 100 h.p. motor engines. The new yacht—
another Bronzewingi—will cost £12,000, and is already
sufficiently advanced to serve as a bold advertisement
of what the Australian workman can do when he gets a
chance.

The most interesting feature of the fight be-
tween Tied Nelson and E. Williams, the Victorian eham"
pion middle-weight was the way it ended. Nelson, who
weighed lOst. 101 b., looked as though insufficiently
trained, while the list. 3£lb. of hard meat and gristle
that was'called Williams looked in the best of condition
At first Nelson, raging like the heathen, climbed
all over his heavier opponent. But he failed to knock
him out, and began to tire, and from the sixth round on.
ward, the Victorian had the better of the bartering
while Nelson got most of the battering. The 17th round
saw Nelson make a great rally, striving frantically fora
knock-out. Williams kept his point well under cover
and Nelson succeeded in damaging his mouth
only. That he completely spoiled. In the last
round Williams grew somewhat reckless, but
his clever opponent was too exhausted to take
advantage of it. He could barely keep his feet, arid 12
seconds from time a slight clip on the jawsent him down
where he remained and was counted out, unable to rise.’
Had he kept on his feet two seconds longer, he would
have made a draw of it. But owing to his lack of prepara-
tion his aggressive tactics wore him right out.

“Snell”: The scrap, at Melbourne Gyclorama
t’other Monday, between Bill Lang and Peter Felix, for
the championship of God’s Own Commonwealth, was a
very tenth-rate business, and demonstrated at how low a
grade scrapping talent stands in Australia to-day. Felix
in these hours of his later middle age, cannot fight to
keep up a fair blood-heat, and his natural objection to
being hurt is manifested in the fact that the battle was
boxed with Boz. gloves. The cushions took all the grit
out of Lang’s blows, or Peter would have had plenty in
two rounds. He stayed for seven, but spent the greater
part of the last four sitting on the hard boards, sadly heark-
ening to the chant of the ten seconds check. If William
looked at dark Peter too hard, the long black cloud got
into a recumbent position, and took the count. After the
seventh chapter of the Book of Stoush, he threw in the
softgoods, having grown weary of sedentary pursuits.
Lang is still our best product in the pug industry.

“ Wrock” : This place (Christchurch, M.L.) is
the City of the Bike, with more machines to the square
mile than any other town in Australasia. Being flat and
scattered, with good level roads, Christchurch lends
itself to cycling, and bicycles of all makes and dekcrip-
tions parade the streets. Every second shop invites you
to save tram-fares and buy a two-wheeler for £5. Only
the unfortunate travel in the cars. From the butcher’s
boy to the politician, from the servant girl to the society
dame—in every walk of life they ride. Women who in
other towns would push a perambulator, in Christchurch
push an 80-gear. Here to steal a machine is an enormity
in the eye of the law, and the sin of planting tin-tacks is
punishable by hanging. Conversation dwells on sprocket
wheels, tyres and hub brakes, and instead of the cus-
tomary “What cheer, Bill?” one hears “What gear,
Bill ?”as a greeting in the street. Yet, strange to relate,
in this home of the wheel the sport of track-racing is
dead, defunct and decayed, and everything connected
therewith has a tombstone at its head and feet, and a
corpse-light burning above its stomach.

The wiping out of the “shop” Mo in Sydney
has made room for Tatt’s Mo., who has spread himself all
over the business part of the city. When he isn’t at
Tatt’s Club, smoking half-crown cigars and sipping the
choicest brands, or in his office trimming up the
odds for staffs of clerks, he advertises in the only way
he dare do by standing at the street door, on and off, for
hours every r day during the weeks prior to big events,
doing “ business” as it happens along, or informing the
inquisitive that they can alway'S find him upstairs. Tatt’s
Club pretended some time ago to legislate against the
bookmaker’s town office, and the law of the land is cer-
tainly opposed to it, but the proprietor continues un-
molested and becomes more daring every day as his con-
nection increases and profits swell.
Australia’s defences appear to be of a
humorous character and somewhat in need of re-
organisation. At present, three non-commissioned
officers and three gunners are wanted for the
garrison at Thursday Island, but two of the
officers who were ordered to proceed there have
decided to resign rather than go north to the Jap-
infested island. This off-hand way of doing
things is rather alarming to an ordinary citizen.
If the Australian forces can throw in the towel
any time they feel that way, it doesn’t seem a
very reliable army.
FLEMINGTON IS CALLING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of course, when I gave racing or when racing gave me
best,
It twinged at first like heartache, now it nags, but not so
sharp ;
But I haven’t joined with Jugfull or with Woodkins and
the rest,
I’m not posing for a halo and not practising the harp.
I was puzzling out a problem of infinity and nought,
When my brain somehow stopped working—l was build-
ing in the moon.
“ Though I can’t in fact go rkcing, I will,” said I in
thought,
“ Be with them in the spirit all this glorious afternoon.”
So I went, old pal, and found you at Scott’s prepared to
start,
Only just one glass of sherry, then off to catch the train •
And waves of old-time feeling went surging through my
heart,
And a bioscope of memories ran flickering through my
brain.
I found it as I’d left it—the same brave wonder-show,
Live Hill and Flat, packed Grandstand, green elms and
lawn and course,
And a wireless message reached me from Way-back-of-
long-ago,
A wind-wave singing-sweetly of woman, wine and horse.
Well, race-days sometimes differ, though they’re mostly
just the same---
The ladies and the luncheon, and “the music of the
pack,”
The fight between the bookies and the battlers at the
game,
And the cheering as the beauties come charging down
the track.
You won, and you collected, then we started back to
town,
With your pockets all a-jingle, and your big heart all
aglow,
But my spirits were not rising, for one thing kept them
down :
The fact that I was with you, and your spirit did not know.
VIC.
THE OLD ADAM.

healthy with a sluggish liver or inactive kidneys; sometimes these organs get thrown
out of action on account of improper food or drink, sometimes from a faulty
metabolism. Nature then requires assistance and it ns of paramount impor an
that the right aid should be employed in dealing with these delicate pieces of
mechanism ° It has been known from time immemorial that certain European spas
which have acquired world-renowned fame on account of their possessing remedial
and health-wmim properties, form a natural stimulant for the liver and act as a
cleansing agent for the kidneys. The health-giving and remedial Parties of these
famous spas are now incorporated in Kutnows Powder w ic J

GOOD RESULTS.
Clements Tonic
Cures and Strengthens,
THE PROOF.
(BY A SPECIAL REPORTER.)
With a view to bringing before the public a
matter of considerable importance, a reporter
rapped at 114 Glebe Road, Glebe, where Mrs.
Hannah Wells resides. The lady appeared in
response, and upon the pressman’s mission being
explained, she said :
“Certainly. Nothing would give me more plea-
sure than to relate the story of my great achieve-
ment of four years ago, especially as it will be so
serviceable to many in want of guidance. You
see it was after fruitlessly trying several home
remedies that I saw about Clements Tonic in the
papers, and made up my mind to find out what it
was like for myself, as I was very ill, and was
willing to, take anything so long as I got better.
I was as
WEAK AND MISERABLE AS ANY
WOMAN COULD BE,
and had such a sallow complexion, too, that to
look at me you would have thought I had the
jaundice. My chest used to cause me no end of
bother, for often I felt that something was there,
blocking my breath, besides having heavy, op-
pressive pains as well. I hadn’t any inclination
to eat.
NO APPETITE AT ALL,
so what could I expect but to get thin and deli-
cate looking, which I assuredly did. From the
time I arose from bed of a morning till I returned
again in the evening I was as languid and indo-
lent as could be. When I tried to sleep at night
I could not, and oh ! it was so wretched being
there hour after hour waiting for the daylight,
and when it came, what did it bring? Only
another day of sorrow. My sight got bad, and
my eyes felt as heavy as lead; the taste in my
mouth was awfully bitter, and the worst of it was
that my head was always aching.
“Indeed, I don’t know what I hadn’t got to
make life a burden, and if I hadn’t taken Clements
Tonic when I did I am afraid to think what would
have happened, for I was going down hill fast.”
“ Had your nerves given way at all ? ”
“Oh ! I was fearfully nervous, scarcely able to
move without getting a shock at some trivial thing
or other, and even when I managed to snatch a
little sleep my mind was unsettled with various
ugly dreams. Now, that is where Clements Tonic
came in with results very speedily. It
quieted my nerves, and gave me such com-
mand over myself that nothing surprised or
excited me, and as for having nasty dreams
or getting frightened at anything—why, I
was quite exempt in both respects. I used to
meet trouble halfway too, but I got quite out of
that habit since using Clements Tonic, which also
made me eat as hungrily as if I had taken a good
sea trip before each meal. What surprised me
more, though, and my friends too, was the manner
in which my pains subsided, for when I told them
that I was perfectly at ease, and that my head-
aches were gone, they could scarcely believe me.
But it is nevertheless a fact that Clements Tonic
cured me and strengthened me thoroughly, and
in the interests of similar sufferers you may pub-
lish these remarks as it suits you.”

fourth day of August, one thousand nine hundred
and three, before me, W. T. TATE, J.P.

S.A. congratulates itself on having at last
“ stopped the rot ” in the matter of its increase
of population. Its marriage rate for last year,
7’9§ per 1000, was the highest since 1884, and
its total of marriages, 3700, by far the best on
record. Then the birth-rate soared to 23'97 per
1000, which is, at any rate, much better than any
of recent years. The death-rate, always low in
S. A., touched the record lowness of 9.72 per 1000.
So the excess of births over deaths was 5000 odd,
and, adding excess of immigration, the central
State reckons that it added over 12,000 to its
population in 1907—the biggest increase since 1881!
Cable :
Mr. Ben Morgan is to visit Australasia and Canada as
commissioner representing the Manufacturers’ Associa-
tion of Great Britain. His object is to make inquiries re
the establishment of branch factories in those countries
on account of the tariffs against importation.
Thus does Protection cast its blighting influence
over the country—the other country.
Jameson of the Raid has been bumped out
of the Premiership of Cape Colony, after four
years of rather inferior management. In his first
year he had nearly £1,000,000 shortage ; second
year nearly £700,000 ; third year he just struggled
through ; and the fourth year’s figures are not
published yet. He gave the debt a considerable
leg up, and got it to over £44,000,000, which, for a
white population of just about 600,000, is a fairly
shocking figure. And he was the humble servant
of the gigantic De Beers diamond monopoly,
which he refused to tax even when the finances
were at their worst. The Raider apparently
meant well, but he gave very little satisfaction to
anybody.
N.S.W. has spent about three-quarters of
a million in Government grants to Exhibitions,
and got poor value in return. The first of these
shows was in 1802, in London, when the State
planked down £7426—money thrown away. Paris
Exhibition of 1867 took £5669, and Paris again
took £10,499. Amsterdam mopped up £5248;
and Chicago (also damned), £36,274. Through
these shows the foreign manufacturer certainly
discovered Australia, and thereupon poured his
stuff into N.S.W. The Government spent
£318,966 on the Garden Palace Exposition, and
the principal effect was that indent merchants
sprang up like mushrooms, and foreign goods
flowed in until the Jennings-Dibbs ad valorem
law applied a mild check. With the new tariff
the coming Shepherd’s Bush Exhibition won’t be
able to do much harm—that’s something, anyhow.
The Democratic losses in Warwick and
Cunningham (Q.) —the worst blots on the election
returns —recall similar results in the German dis-
tricts of S. Aus. The little racial papers in
Queensland printed the most amazing yarns
about Kidston’s intentions with regard to farm
labor, and some weird lies got such a start that they
were never overhauled. In S. Aus. “Paddy”
Glynn, M.H.R., who used to be a better Demo-
crat than he is to-day, poured out his torrent of
pure Irish, and, fresh from Dublin, advocated, of
course, a land-tax. The German farmer who
listened to him, could only grasp a word here and
there, but mostly it was “ land wherefore,
the enemy went abroad assuring Hans and
Gretchen that Glynn was a wild revolutionist
who preached confiscation of farms. So they
landed Glynn carefully on his ear—till they knew
him better. Then they got into the habit of
doing it to Glynn’s opponent.
“ Polstan ” : Railway-boss Tait is a man
of ideas. A little while ago he humped his im-
ported shoulders, and got hard to work altering
the names of things. “Riddell’s Creek ” became
mere “Riddell.” Sulky Gully is now an adjective
only—“ Sulky.” A wrecking gang and a team of
painters descended upon a long-deceased siding
known as Simsons, tore down the name-board, and
chucked it into the next State, replacing it with a
monster hoarding bearing the new title—“Sim-
son” —thus economising to the extent of a black
“ S,” at a cost of many pounds. Station masters
are now “ station agents.” A goods train is a
“freight train.” The lines are “roads” I —and
bump worse than ever. Yet, with all this change
in nomenclature, all but a few trains still take
three hours to go 30 miles, and the “ station
agents ” still fall asleep into the soup at dinner,
through sheer exhaustion.
“Javelin”: The recent appointment as
honorary justices of two Victorian police magis-
trates who had passed the age limit and been com-
pelled to retire makes one wonder why the idea of
compelling all J’s.P. to resign at, say, 60 has never
struck the mighty Bent. Was at a country court
not long ago when a J.P., who was very deaf
from old age, occupied the Bench on his own. A
drunk was' duly charged, and the arresting con-
stable gave evidence as to having found him lying
on a footpath helplessly inebriated. The magis-
trate, under the impression that the case was one
in which the accused was charged with illegal
gaming (of which case he had evidently heard
particulars before entering the Court), proceeded,
to the astonishment of all present, especially the
drunk, to deliver, with the fluency and perspicuity
characteristic of our Justices, a homily on the im-
morality of gambling of any kind. It was only
by the united efforts of the Clerk of Courts and
the police that he was made to understand that
the cash under consideration was not the gambling
one. To make amends for his own mistake, he
imposed an exceptionally heavy fine. However,
the inebriate was probably glad to escape at the
price, even though it was rather above the average.
H. Lucy’s weekly letter in S. M. Herald
(15/2/’O3) was obviously prepared expressly for
Australian consumption. It began with a gushing
reference to the Christmas dinner to old soldiers,
which Lucy rightly called an advertising dodge.
Then Lucy went on :
The new movement, designed to deliver Crimean and
Indian Mutiny heroes from the thraldom of the work-
house, is absolutely free from such a cloud. The State
has established and endowed two noble institutions for
the relief and maintenance of old soldiers and sailors.
But Chelsea and Greenwich Hospitals cannot admit more
than a tithe of the deserving applicants.
Is the man who was responsible for the appear-
ance of that in the Herald ignorant or a wilful
falsifier? Greenwich Hospital was closed in ’69,
and the pensioners who had no near relations
willing to receive them were sent to the work-
house. The reason alleged was that it was better
for the old fellows that they should be with
friends than in a public institution. Very
few of them had any friends, at any rate friends
who could afford to take care of cripples with no
more than Is. a day pension. The vacated hos-
pital was turned into a Naval College, which
might be a much more appropriate use for such a
fine building, but that is no excuse for telling lies
about it, or for the atrocious meanness with which
pensions are allotted. Fancy giving a permanently
crippled man, with a limb or an eye gone, 9d. a
day for two years! Yet that is all a man with
short service can get.

That Fringe
Why does your hair grow on one part of
your head and not on another? Ever ask
yourself this question ? Have you noticed that
* ba t fringe grows just below where your
hat rests? Let us tell you why. Your hair
grows the same as grass; it depends upon a
sod to sustain and nourish it. That soil is
your scalp. The part of your hair which is
above your hat-band has had all the fife
sweated and steamed out of if by being con-
fined; in other words the vitality of your
scalp has been exhausted; your hair has
nothing to draw nourishment from.
Nourish Your Scalp
Make that part of your hair which is above
your hat-band as fertile as the part which is
below. Energize it; build it up; nourish it.
A strong, healthy scalp will grow strong,
healthy hair. Just because you’re a man is
no reason why you should be bald. Save
what little hair you have left, and begin sys-
tematically to grow more. It s very simple
if you start about it in the right way; that
way is Barry’s Tri-coph-erous.
How to Begin
Twice a week, before going to bed, apply
Tri-coph-erous to your scalp, Wet it thor-
oughly, and manipulate gentiy for four or five
minutes so that the scalp becomes loose and
pliable. Use Barry s Tri-coph-erous twice a
week but keep up the scalp manipulation
every night. Wash the head every ten days
with warm water and Reuter’s Soap. Keep
up this treatment for a month or six weeks,
and see for yourself the hair-growing powers
of Barry s Tri-coph-erous.
Be Sure
When you go to your chemist’s for Tri-
coph-erous, be sure you get Barry’s. The
success of Barry’s Tri-coph-erous has made
many Trade Thieves who would rob it of
its glory by selling worthless imitations or by
substituting “ hair growers ’’ which cannot ful-
fill the claims made for Tri-coph-erous.
Barry’s Tri-coph-erous is made by Barclay
Sc Co., U. S. A.

WHEN YOU
BUY YOUR BICYCLE
SPECIFY B.S.A. FITTINGS—
Don’t, however, stop at specification—see that your instructions are carried
out—look for the mark of the Piled Rifles on every component part—that,
and that only, is your guarantee. Unscrupulous dealers will probably offer
you “8.5.F1. pattern”—describe the machine built therefrom as “just as good,”
but don’t be misled—there is nothing "just as good”—there may be something
which at first sight looks the same, but test will reveal its inferiority.
We place the mark on every part for your protection—insist on its appearance

Is the only Piano Player that can interpret all the works of the
great masters as written, it having a full compass of 72 NOTES.
This extended range does away with the necessity of mutilation required
for players with a shorter compass.
The Ciaviola Artist Music Rolls are absolutely unique and without
parallel—they are electric records, note by note, of the ACTUAL
PLAYING of the World’s Greatest Pianists, and are perfect renditions
of the classics.
Other important features of the Ciaviola are: —
Special Levers for Phrasing and Melody Accentuation.
Brass Tubing and Leather Bellows throughout.
No Perishable Rubber used.
Our Library, comprising thousands of rolls of music, is available to
purchasers on payment of a small annual subscription.
The Ciaviola can be bought on easy terms, and we issue a special
invitation to any lady or gentleman interested to call and play their
favorite composition —we promise them a revelation.

FROOTOIDS
For Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, and Biliousness.
OOO -
The immense number of orders for
Frootoids, sent by post direct to the Pro-
prietor, is convincing proof that the
Public appreciate their splendid curing
| power over the above-named complaints.
They are elegant in appearance, pleasant
i to take, and, what is of the utmost
importance, are thoroughly reliable in
affording quick relief.
Frootoids are immensely more valu-
able than an ordinary aperient, in so far
that they not only act as an aperient,
blit do remove from the blood, tissues, and
internal organs, waste poisonous matter
that is clogging them and choking the
channels that lead to and from them.
The beneficial effects of Frootoids are
evident at once by the disappearance of
headache, the head becoming clear, and
a bright,---cheery sense of perfect health
taking the v place of sluggish, depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are the proper aperient
medicine to take when any Congestion
or Blood Poison is present, or when Con-
gestion of the Brain or Apoplexy is pre-
sent or threatening. They have b@en
tested, and have been proved to afford
quick relief in such cases when other
aperients have not done any good at all.
It is of the utmost importance that this
should be borne in mind, for in such
cases to take an ordinary aperient is to
waste time and permit of a serious ill-
ness becoming fatal.
Frootoids act splendidly on the liver,
and quickly cure bilious attacks that
“antibilious pills” make worse. Many
people have been made sick and ill by
“antibilious pills” who could have been
cured at once by Frootoids. People
should not allow themselves to be duped
into contracting a medicine-taking habit
by being persuaded to take daily doses
with each meal of so-called indigestion
cures that do NOT cure. Frootoids
have been subjected to extensive tests,
and have in every case proved success-
ful in completely curing the complaints
named.
The ordinary adult dose of Frootoids,
of which there are 72 in a bottle, is 2 to
4 —more Qr less as required—taken, pre-
ferably at bedtime, when constipated,
or at the commencement of any other
disease requiring an aperient, bs aD
auxiliary with the special medicine
necessary for the case. ' A constipated
hafiit of body will be completely cured
if the patient will on each occasion,
when suffering, take a dose of Frootoids,
instead of an ordinary aperient; making
the interval between the taking of each
dose longer and the dose smaller. The
patient thus gradually becomes indepen-
dent of Aperient Medicines.

HOLLOWAY’S PILLS
4? cV* ,<s>
THE PILLS
have gained their wonderful reputation by sheer force
of merit, because every person who uses them
recommends them to others. They have positively
no equal for thoroughly cleansing the system and
putting the liver and kidneys in functional order,
without pain or griping. They are the best known
remedy for Indigestion, Biliousness, Headache,
Dizziness, and the common condition of ill-health
known as "run-down” or “out of sorts.” Females
of every age find Holloway's Pills an invaluable
remedy and aid.
THE OINTMENT
is known throughout the world as positively the
best and quickest remedy for Bad Legs, Old
Wounds and Sores, and Skin Eruptions of every

matism, Lumbago, Pains and Stiffness in the
Limbs and Joints, Backache, etc. For pains and
Soreness at the Chest, and for Throat and Lung
Complaints arising from Cold or Weakness,

RUPTURE
CURED BY ELECTRICITY.
Dr. McLaughlin’s Electro-Plastic Truss
is a positive cure for all forms of
Rupture. Write for full particulars and copies of testimonials.
Weakness Cannot Win
in the battle Of life. Life’s battle is a hard one, and you must have steady nerve, a clear brain, and muscles like
bands gf steel. The weak man or woman must give way to the strong, the robust and the vigorous. Your health and
physical vitality should be guarded as the miser guards his gold. Dr. McLaughlin, the electrical authority, has discov-
ered the true method of applying Electricity for the perfect cure of the ills and ailments
of mankind. Electricity is Nature’s Remedy. There is not a weak person in
this whole world to-day who cannot become strong, healthy and vigorous again if they
will only apply the right current of Electricity. We have a method of applying Electricity
for the cure of the various weaknesses of men and women which will cure in every case.
Our method of applying Electricity is fast supplanting the use of drugs all over the world.

DRUGS ARE USELESS!
Drugs cannot and will not cure the Nervous Ailments and Weaknesses of Men and
Women, such as Loss of Vigor and Vitality, Rheumatism, Kid-
, ney, Liver and Bladder Troubles, Constipation, Stomach
Disorders, etc., etc. Nature never intended a man’s stomach to be the
receptacle for strong drugs, and if you persist in their use it will not be long until
you will be beyond curing ; your stomach will be totally destroyed. Electricity,
when applied by Dr. McLaughlin's Electric Belt, gives to every part
of the body—as it travels over the nerves—strength and vitality, and quickly
drives out disease, no matter where it is located. When you are weak there is
simply a lack of Electricity in the system—not enough electricity to keep up your
nerve force—and before you can again be restored to vitality and vigor electricity
must be supplied. Weakness defeats the aim or ambition of man. The weak
man must be made strong before he has the necessary energy and brain power to
succeed. Electricity builds up the shattered nervous system, restores strength and
vitality; makes rich, red blood ; it is the bulwark against which disease must fall. It brings
the sunbeams of happiness and health into a life which has been darkened by weakness. We have thousands of
testimonials to prove all our assertions. Our belt is simple, easy to use and is guaranteed to give a strong current.
It has special attachments fop men and women. They are within the reach of all; price £ i and up.
Beware of cheap imitations.

Judge Johnston has been making some
large and characteristically stodgy remarks about
the perjury committed by prisoners who give evi-
dence in their own defence. Many Victorian
lawyers, some of them on the Bench, have a
strange objection to the law which enables
prisoners to give evidence on oath.. Judge John-
ston is one of them, and he lately declared that
the Crown Law authorities should seriously con-
sider the prosecution of prisoners who ” thus
availed themselves of the law and were disbelieved
by the jury. Tru<, perjury should be punished
whenever it can be proved; but note that his
Honor said not a word about the Crown witnesses
who give evidence on oath and are disbelieved by
the jury. This happens a good deal more often

HEARNES Hi
The Famous Remedy for
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, & CONSUMPTION,
Has the Largest Sale of any Chest Medicine in the World.
3 Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Its healing power is marvellous. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of
Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it
effects a Complete Cure. It is most comforting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become
chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has never been known to exist where “ Coughs” have been properly treated with this medicine. No house
should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient, and a Complete Cure is certain.
Beware of Imitations ! The great success of HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, has induced a number
of unprincipled persons to make imitations, each calling his medicine “Bronchitis Cure,” with the object of
deceiving the simple-minded, and so getting a sale for an imitation which has none of the beneficial effects that
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE has. Consequently it has become necessary to draw your attention to this fact,
and to request you in your own interests to be particular to ask for HEARNE’S and to see that you get it.
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE, Small Size, 2/6; Large Size, 4/6. Sold by Chemists and Medicine Vendors, and by the
Proprietor, W. G. HEARNE, Chemist, Geelong, Victoria. Forwarded to any Address, when not obtainable locally.
NOTlCE—Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure No. iAdoes NOT contain any poison within the meaning of the Act. It is equally beneficial for the youngest
child and the most aged person.
BENGER’S FOOD is quite
distinct from any other. It
possesses the remarkable property
of rendering milk with which it
is mixed when used, quite easy of
digestion by Infants and Invalids.
o>
One of the most valuable foods
known to science. It gives the
body abundance of nourishment,
with complete or partial rest to
the digestive system, regulated
as may be advisable.
Benger s Food is sold in tins by Chemists, etc., everywhere.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
riIHE instructions of the boss were brief and
I to the point : “Go to both sites and sum
up all the points for and against each, and
take photographs to bear out your report.” So I
caught the camera in one hand and the gripsack
in the other, and fled down to the mail train,
where I entered a car that was capable of being
turned into a sleeping compartment. On the
seat opposite was a young man badly afflicted
with pimples and belief m Carruthers, and he
eulogised the wire-netting incident as
patriotism. Beside him was a little
fat doctor who was hurrying away to
the wilds to operate on someone who
was too ill to be brought into any
hospital. We talked a while, and
then the youth with pimples an-
nounced his intention of making a
sleeper. So he hoisted up the top
berth and stretched himself out. The
medico, who carried cushions and
rugs, made himself comfortable un-
derneath, and I wrapped myself in
my martial top coat and used the
camera as a pillow, while I told them
horrible tales of railway accidents.
At the first stop the doctor said that
my recital had unnerved him so that
the only thing to put him right was
whisky, and plenty of it. We got
out and soaked, and the doctor brought
along a special reserve in case I "re-
membered any more horrors. Then
the train rumbled away into dark-
ness and wilderness. Sleep came
over us. All was peace. Suddenly
the top berth, having been fixed up
by an amateur, worked loose and
came down with a fearful crash. It
spilled the pimply believer in Car-
ruthers into the middle of next
week, and buried and crushed the
medico under about 651 b. of cushion
and frame-work. Pimples and myself
organised a rescue party, and got
him out. He rushed wildly for the
door. We held him back by brute
force. He staggered up and felt
each limb cautiously and critically,
and thanked God no bones were
broken. Then he inquired if we
could tell him what the train had
struck. We explained, and he sat
down and breathed heavily. His
fingers stole out convulsively and
he took to drink. So did we all. At
Queanbeyan I shouted to the guard
to unlock the door and let me out.
He observed the sleeper, muttered something,
examined his list, and then claimed 10s. on behalf
of the Railway Commissioners. The row about
the sleeper was proceeding gaily as I left and
plunged into the cold gray dawn, and climbed on
to the ’bus that was to take me to Queanbeyan.
By 7.30 I was on the way to Canberra, Wade’s
latest selected Federal capital site. The day
•came up swelteringly hot, and the ground
gasped. At first we ran downhill, and
then commenced a long uphill climb. Dun-
troon Plains were naked and scorched, and
the sheep were few, having been mostly removed
to snow lands. The sun glowed dully through
smoke and haze, and the land seemed utterly
desolate. We met no people, we saw no birds,
not even the übiquitous magpie or hardy crow.
I asked the driver what had become of the birds.
“ Poisoned ! ” was the laconic reply.
Leaving Duntroon Plain the road wound round
the butt of a hill and entered a patch of bush.
•Still no sign of bird life. Then we started down-
hill with a run, and at the end of a couple of miles
the driver pulled up in front of what seemed a
•quiet little farm house.
“Canberra!” he said, preparing to hoist out
•my bag.
I got out and stared round quite dazed. The
sulky was already disappearing. In the distance

At Dalgety (N.S.W.), the site selected by the Australian Parliament for the capital
of the Commonwealth.
-a church lifted its spire into the smoke-laden
atmosphere. Half a mile from it the rectory
stood bowered in trees. I looked at the cottage.
On the opposite side of the road a board displayed
the legend : “Accommodation House. Summer
Brinks.” Over one door of an office at the end
of the verandah was a printed notice : “ Common-
wealth Electoral Registrar.” And beside it
another; “ Post Office.” So this little house was
the business centre of Canberra. Four sheep
came straggling along the road. They were the
only inhabitants in sight.
I knocked at the door of the business centre of
Canberra, left my luggage, discovered what time
dinner would be about, shed my coat and vest,
and started out with a half-plate camera and a
pocket kodak to take views. I made for the top
of Mt. Ansley, a granite upheaval covered with,
scrub eucalyptus, and as I walked through the'

ingress for water difficult and outlet for sewage
impossible, was the site Wade and Carruthers
proposed to hand over to the Australian Govern-
ment for a national capital—the place that was
to be the heart of Australia, if these two had
their way.
* * * *
Next morning found me on the way to the
Cotter “River,’’ which is to supply water to
Wade’s Federal capital. We left Canberra on
the right, and bore away for an opening in the
ring of hills. Later on I saw that the hills that
Wade was reported to have described in Quean-
bevan a few days before as “ natural fortifications ”
were shockingly numerous, and also dominated by
higher peak's beyond. The only signs of life
were the thousands of rabbits, which were out even
in the glaring light of the early morning. As we
entered the wooded country where the long and
steep descent to the Murrumbidgee commences,
two magpies flew across the track, and a solitary
eaglehawk soared away heavily through the
burning air. Just above the Murrumbidgee two
crows flew out and cawed away into distance. The
descent of the last couple of hundred feet was too
steep for our vehicle, with its damaged brakes,
and we took the horse out and carried down the
cameras and billy. Under the shade of the she-
oaks the driver pointed to a tiny trickle of water
flowing into the Murrumbidgee on the other side,
and broke me up with—
“ That’s Cotter Creek, boss ! ”
We boiled the billy where we stood. All around
were champagne corks and cookshop labels. No
bottles—orfJjkfiorks. The dead marines had either
been removecTPr thrown into the river, but the
corks and the labels remained to hint at the
gorgeous spread Wade, Carruthers and party had
indulged in at that very spot some four days
before.
And they wanted champagne when they got
there too, for they had an exciting time on the
way out. N. S. Wales’s cold, strong Premier sat

A bad back is Nature’s signal of distress, a call for help from the
kidneys. The aching tells of dangerous congestion that robs the
kidneys of their blood-filtering power, or painful, wasting inflamma-

PUBLIC TESTIMONY.
FROM LIVERPOOL.
Mr. J. Livingstone. Ingleburn, near Liverpool says : —“ For years I suffered from gravel.
I had medical advice, and underwent three operations in two years for stone in the bladder,
but I only got relief for a couple of months after each operation, and would soon be as bad as
ever again. I was so bad with backache that I would cry out with the pain, and to bend was
agony. I simply could not do my work. To add to my sufferings, my secretions were very
frequent and high colored. After the best doctors failed to cure me I did not think that
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills would be able to cure me ; but my wife kept on urging me to
try them. At last I did get them, and after taking one box I felt a little better. After
using the third box I knew I was on the road to recovery, and had great hopes of a perfect cure.
I was not disappointed, for after eight boxes I was sound and well. The gravel and backache
were cured, my secretions were natural, and I slept like a baby. I consider my cure a miracle.”
Eight years later, Mr. Livingstone says :—“ The above is quite true, every word, and I
can now tell you that lam still well. My cure proves that there’s nothing as good as Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills for the kidneys.”
FROM BALMAIN-
Mr. P. Smith, 1 Cheltenham Street, Balmain, Sydney, says :—“ I used Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills for kidney trouble, and they worked a miracle in my case. I had been under
three doctors at different times, but their treatment did me no good. I used to be so bad
that I would have to be carried home on a cart if an attack came on when working in the
street. Sometimes I have been taken to the hospital when one of these bad attacks came on. 1
suffered with a kind of biliousness and vomiting, my secretions were very bad ; I could never
bend my back or move at all when I had a bad turn. The people at the hospital gave me
medicines and recommended rubbing in liniments, but it was of no use ; they did not benefit
me. I saw an advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and procured this remedy.
I only took one box, and was cured. When I finished them I started work, and have worked
ever since. These Pills cured me after years of suffering, and the relief was instantaneous.'
Mrs. Smith, says, eight years later : —“ My husband lias had wonderful health since he
used Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I am convinced that he owes his life to this remedy
He is now so well, thanks to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”

on the box seat, and the brake power, as usual,
was deficient for the fearful grade, which is like
the gable of a house. The vehicle was built for a
road, arid not a mountain side. And as they tore
down one steep incline it looked as though the
load had taken charge. The driver kept a cool
head and a strong arm, and brought the team
round and the coach to a standstill on the first
level. But one of the polers began to kick
furiously, and finally getting his leg over the pole,
made the turf fly in great style. The driver turned
to Wade :
“Lord love me, he’s got ther pip. Hold the
reins, boss, till I get hold of his blanky head, ther
cow ! ”
“ I’m darned if I do!” said the cold, strong
statesman, taking a flying leap on to the grass,
and dragging the delicate Carruthers from the
interior. The disgusted driver descended and
fixed up things without assistance. The party
walked the rest of the way to the Murrumbidgee,
where they had lunch, after which one of the
party, or the menials, brought over Hardy’s punt,
that was fastened on the other side. Going
across, the heavily-loaded punt ran aground, and
Wade ordered one of the party to get out. Some
unfortunate wretch did so, and descended to his
thighs in thick, smelly mud. And he wore
elegant lavender pants, too. But Alaric-like,
Wade swept on, full of hot tea and State Rights
enthusiasm, and climbed distant peaks, whereon
he declaimed on the beauties of the place and the
magnificence of the water supply.
•n * tt *
That water supply was the Cotter, which, when
I saw it, was a tiny, purling stream babbling
between boulders. On one side was a succession
of mud ridges, and on the other a wide stretch of
naked rocks, between which, and in little pools
right against the Cotter itself, gleamed the iri-
descent scum that tells of mineral oil. Down
where the stream empties itself into the Murrum-
bidgee the oil was carried out into the river.
Clad in an old hat, boots and socks, writer carried
his camera out into the Murrumbidgee and photo-
graphed the meeting of the waters. It was not
imposing. Then he waded in at the actual junc-
tion, where the Cotter was eight yards wide, and the
depth reached six inches. In the swiftest part of
the Cotter the 30-guinea camera stood safe and
undisturbed to have its photo taken by the pocket
kodak. Higher up, the bed became more rugged,
the rocks bigger and more plentifully scattered
around. The Cotter here became a series of
holes of varying depths connected by little purl-
ing streams. In some places there was no volume
of stream, and the water oozed between great
slabs of rock in a dozen little rivulets, in which a
child could not have got its feet really wet if
its life depended on it.
The Cotter oozes out of a narrow, shallow gorge
between two low spurs. The gorge is so narrow
that even were it dammed it would retain but
little water, and any reservoir to hold a decent
quantity of water would have to be built on the
plain, which would mean that most of it would
consist of artificially-constructed retaining walls.
At Queanbeyan I beard much of the quality of
the water, but when I waded in it I found it un-
pleasant to the taste.
• * * *
The question that rises in the mind of a man
traversing the district is : “ Why on earth did the
N.S.W. Government pick upon Canberra ? ” The
place does not seem to possess one solitary advan-
tage. Presumably the capital of Australia will
one day be a great city. It will contain cannon
foundries, rifle and ammunition factories, the Civil
Service of a continent, and should naturally become
a great manufacturing centre. The proposed
Canberra city would have to pump every drop of
water it received from the Cotter over several
hundreds of feet of elevation, and then, when it
had got the water, it would have to store it in a
great artificial reservoir, for Canberra is a level
plain from which the hills rise suddenly. And
that reservoir would have to be supported on
gigantic arches, beside which those that supported
the hanging gardens of Babylon were but a cir-
cumstance. The disposal of sewage would also be
an interesting question. The only outlet is into
the Queanbeyan River, which flows into the Mur-
rumbidgee, and any other disposition of sewage
would necessitate tunnelling through hills largely
composed of granite. So the question as to why
the N.S.W. Government fixed upon Canberra re-
mains unanswered. And, so far, the N.S.W.
Premier has not explained.
Having done Canberra and its water supply,
the Cotter “ River, ” writer took train to Cooma,
and the coach thence to Dalgetv. From Cooma
the coaph toils up the Heaven-built ramparts of
Australia’s impregnable citadel. And then the
cool breeze, and the violet distances of that great
tableland burst on one suddenly. The people you
meet are different. They are an energetic race,
ruddy-cheeked, quick and restless. The grass
was green, and after the naked miles of earth be-
tween Queanbeyan and Cooma positively refresh-
ing to the eye. North of Cooma the land was
absolutely devoid of vegetation—it was bare,
naked dust like that in the middle of the road.
Up here there were miles of rolling green-and-
brown grass, and the cattle and sheep were fat.
We rolled along through wood and wold, till
rounding a mass of granite the Snowy River,
roaring, rushing, and foaming, broke on the view.
Masses of granite upheaved in its bed, it howled
and foamed around them, and the great wide
ribbon of silver flashed and glittered in the after-
noon sunlight and vanished round a curve amid
the rolling downs. And beyond these downs rose
the blue dim mass of another impregnable ram-
part, behind which Australian armies could make
a last stand in the face of overwhelming numbers.
■» * * *
A pleasant-faced Monaro girl smiled cheerfully.
“Would you like a hot bath to take the stiffness
out of you after the long drive ? ” Would a duck
swim ? And when the bath had been partaken of
she said something about tea, and served up tender
cold beef with a French salad. This comfortable
Imperial Hotel, with white floors holystoned every
morning, is lit with acetylene gas, and looks down
on the long bridge which spans the Snowy at
what was once known as “Buckley’s Crossing.”
And the vast length of the bridge shows what the
river is like when it is “ up.” When I saw it, it
was reported at about the lowest, yet it was nearly
eighty yards wide, with an average depth of three
feet. It, too, has holes, and there are whirlpools
in them. Away from the river the country that
appears to be plain is discovered, when traversed,
to be a succession of rolling downs, with great
hollows lying between them, and any one of these
depressions could be, turned into a reservoir easily
and cheaply. It is merely a case of a few retain-
ing walls between the ridges, and the fall of the
country is such that tremendous pressure can be
obtained. Throughout the district the soil is
good, and there is an almost unlimited supply of
timber for firewood and other purposes. The
local granite is easily worked, and when properly
faced makes a magnificent building stone.
Already a church has been erected of it, and now
private people are beginning to build their home-
steads of it instead of with timber. It is a district
into which practically the whole population of
the Commonwealth could be concentrated in war
time, and whence Australian armies could
be sent out north, south and west to win back the
lost country. It is a natural fastness, the im-
pregnable stronghold of the white man’s lonely
outpost in the far Pacific.

The Song of the Back to Front.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Finn stokes well in the hot Red Sea,
where the fireman damns his soul,
And the played-out sons of a warm country
went furthest towards the Pole.
The grief is oft to the topside pup—and the
“ first ” runs out of the hunt—
And —this is the song of the downside up, and a
song of the back to front.
Yes—grunt !
And a song of the back to front.
Oh ! this is the way that it all begun since first on
one end we trod.
The short girl yearns for the six-foot-one, and the
long for the- four-foot-odd !
Or this is the way that it all began (if my
grammar’s misunderstood),
The good girl loveth the bad, bad man, and the
bad girl loves the good.
Yo-o-u—would !
And the bad girl loves the good.
The thin girl seeketh the stout boy oft when the
slight boy’s there to win ;
And often the man who is fat and soft gets roped
by the hard and thin.
The slave-wife loveth her “ boss ” and house, and
everything seems to suit,
And the pampered -wife leaves a generous spouse
and sticks to a drunken brute.
Ye-es —shoot !
And she sticks to a drunken brute.
The woman says “ Yes ” when she meaneth
“No,” and “No” when she meaneth “Yes”;
But the blithering fool who would take her so is
about to fall in, I guess.
The mother sticks fast to the worthless one who
treateth her with contempt,
And often she hateth the good old son of whose
“ feelings ” she never dreamt—
Yes ! dreamt —
Of whose feelings she never dreamt.
The low comedian’s glum off-stage, and the heavy
tragedian’s gay,
With the artist or poet at Pint or Page, ’tis ever
the selfsame way.
The fool looks wise, and the wise a fool, and the
extra-“open” looks sly,
The smart and the cunning is oft the tool that
the plain and the simple ply.
They’re fly—
So the plain and the simple ply.
The hard man’s “soft” when the crisis comes
though the whole of his life be marred,
And often as not, in our peaceful homes, are the
“ soft ” men mean and hard.
The excitable man—when the crisis arrives—is
cool— as often as not.
And the calm, mild men with the fiend’s own wives
are wild to the world, and hot—
Yes ! Ge-e-t hot !
Are wild to the world and hot.
The weeds go through where the strong men fail—
be it office or desert or trench,
And the fattest cowards in England’s tale brought
tucker slap through the French !
The coward dies for his king and gods, and he
throws his men away,
But the brave man runs from the doubtful odds—
that his foe may run next day —
Wotcher say ?
That his foe may run some day.
The pig is clean, and the bulldog kind, but the
man is a brute or hog.
’Tis starve, sty, or bludgeon, you’ll mostly find,
that spoileth the man, pig and dog.
The poet is generous, noble and clean, and he
singeth by day and night,
But the edit —er —publisher? Woddidimean?—
well, I didn’t mean that way quite.
* * * ! ! !! all right —!! —
But I didn’t —mean —thatwayquite.

THE RED RAGE BACKYARD
H. G. Wells begins in The Pall Mall a
new story dealing, in realistic fashion, with
the coming of the air-ship and its conse-
quences. His* solution of the problem of
flying is a sort of mechanical “ giant insect ”
that “ droned along at the rate of three miles
an hour.” The inventor’s machine “was
neither bird-like nor butterfly-like, nor
had it the wide, lateral expansion of
the ordinary aeroplane. The effect upon
the observer was rather something in the
nature of a bee or wasp. Parts of
the apparatus were spinning very rapidly,
and gave one a hazy effect of transparent
wings ; but parts, including two peculiarly
curved ‘ wing-cases ’ —if one may borrow a
figure from the flying beetles—remained
expanded stiffly.” Meantime, America has
ordered an aeroplane from the Wright
Brothers, who are, so far, the only persons
that have safely flown.
Having exhausted the other humorists—
Dickens, Browning, and Job—G. K. Chester-
ton promises a book upon G. B. Shaw.
And, if he’s not careful, some day Shaw will
write a preface explaining G. K. Chesterton.
The quaint conventions of the novelist are
noted by a writer in the Albany Magazine.
One of the most persistent is the habit of the
heroine of hiding her letters in the bosom of
her dress—despite the fact that nowadays
her blouse fastens up behind. She also
“throws back her veil”—a feat which
cannot be performed even with the motor-
veil, which must be carefully untied or un-
wound. Both heroes and heroines “start”
on hearing an unlooked-for name ; though in
real life the thing never occurs. And the
hero persists in “turning on his heel.” “If
anyone supposes this to be the usual method
of turning away with sudden decision, let him
try to do it himself.” Again, servants in-
variably speak with more (or less) “ h’s ”
than they are credited with. And one of the
first articles in the novelist’s code of morals
is that passion, not loyalty, is the only basis
of conjugal fidelity ; while the novelist’s
theory is that to love once is to love for ever—
which is rare, if not impossible. And in
fiction self-sacrifice becomes a fetich. But
all these are minor falsehoods compared with
the neat, complete, “ happy ending.”
