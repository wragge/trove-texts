VISION OF WAR.
Along the edge of the thicket just now, as I
went to the orook doion there for renter,
I stumbled over something that must have
been left from the cliqrge a week ago:
A body that held the remnants of a man.
He had dragged himself to the brook, he lay
imbedded in tall reaving grass;
His stoma.fh had been ripped open by shrap-
_ j tel, maggots were, heaving in the wound;
(Did you know that v man could live while
maggots formed in his flesh?)
His muscles twitched convulsively, he was
barely conscious;
He did not notice the match I struck, his
eyes were filmed over, he would not
drink ;
The region that he inhabited was an un-
. known, unimaginable land,
(At home, a woman waits for news of him;
It is well that she can never hear.) ....
There are no illusions about the body, no
sorrowing or regret;
The body seen in its true place, and given its
just due.
(Hustle it off,' bury it quick, dig a shallow
hole;
Dust to dust—it will help the next year's
crops;
"No time to spare for foolish ceremonies, no
ammunition to spare for a parting
volley;
It is .only death—the man is done with his
body now —it is no more use to him or
anybody else;
It was never very important—not h< If so
important as he himself imagined;
Now it is the least important thing in the
w0r1d.) ....
Look at that overgrown baby, blubbering at
a cut finger;
I suppose it hurts, but what of it?—Ms hip is
broken—l wish it tvas his neck;
What a row he makes—for God’s sake, choke
him off, or take him away;
Wouldn’t you think a man with a body like
that would have some sand in his gutsf
A perfect physique—he was fond of showing
his strength, he ivas everlastingly talk-
ing about it;
He could do some wonderful things, too —the
strongest man I ever saw;
But God deliver us from these blatant lumps
of flesh;
Look behind the muscle, when there is work
to do:
Look beyond the body, when there is pain to
bear ....
Old man, you hold a wrong conception of this
thing called war;
The actual fighting is not of the least im-
portance;
The killing and being killed are not worth
talking about;
The willingness to be killed is the only vital
issue;
of war is its only argument. . 7".
O, sometimes it seems to me that after a
time of peace, men rush to war with
gladness, hearts relieved to live again!
O, to have done with this sad fraud! To
throw aside these chains! Be free, be
free!
O, to do something natural once more!
Forget the hideous pressure of the
world!
O, to escape the stifling air! To breathe the
open! To see the stars again!
O, to go out and die for an idea again!. ...
The peacemakers speak as if the truth had
already arrived;
They speak as if the world could not be
bettered much, society in. its final stage,
man nearing his perfection;
Go, ask tlie poor if this be so:—
They cry that war is a hideous waste of
ivealth, the stored-up labor of hands;
But if peace stores up the labor of hands for
other hands than those which performed
the labor, I say that such peace is more
hideous waste of wealth than war. ...
(I say; in war, something is being changed
— something, at least, is coming
through. ) ....
War offers a freer field for rich and poor to
suffer and pay alike;
And only out of war shall come eventual
universal equity. ...
Europe has been betrayed!—Civilisation has
been set back a century!—-
(As if men from some other planet had stuck
a finger in your pie!)
I think it is only Europe's business that has
been "betrayed"—the soul of Europe has
been affirmed with deathless affirmation;
I think it is only the falsehood of civilisa-
tion that has been “set back a century”;
The truth of civilisation has advanced an-
other imperceptible degree. ...
Come now, old man, we have been bluffing
long enough;
Shoio down your hand.
What is this tale that you are trying to tell
me?
Do you really expect to continue just as you
are, forever and ever?
Do you really expect this nation and that
nation to continue just as they are, for-
ever and ever?
Do you really expect this race and that race
to continue just as they are, forever and
ever?
How are you going to manage it?—l think
you will have your job cut out for
y0u ....
Ah, Germany, where are your aneient
dreams?
You are cruelly earnest, terribly serious;
You have fought with your soul —notv you
are fighting the world;
(But I think it was the world that you won
in your soul;
/ think it is your soul that fights you now in
the world.)
I think you are just another awful contra-
diction;
I think you have tried to make a religion out
of scepticism;
Something, at any rate, has kept you in fight-
ing trim;
Something has fired you with the reaction of
a dream;
I think you are a creative, religious power,
in arms against religion;
I think you are love gone mad, contending in
the dark with love.
I think you are monstrously, religiously
wrong..*.
Japan, you have learned it ivell —you may go
to the head of the class;
You speak it without a hitch —you can beat
the others at their own game.
(And that is why your day is not so long.)
Do you think that a race can throw over-
board a well-stowed cargo of two thou-
sand years, and tumble in an alien load,
and crack on sail?
There is no ballast in that ship—she cannot
stand against God’s gusty wind;
She loill go over in some squall, and drown
her company;
(The squalls come heavy off the China
shore.)
All the old beauty gone, the fine old truth,
The ancient honor of an upright race;
A nation’s birthright sold for the .world’s
pottage,
While the Elder Statesmen shake their heads,
prepared to go.
A century’s brief power—and then a century
to die;
For this, you dare to wake the sleeping
giant;
And this shall be your end....
America, I think you have not shoion your-
self....
I think that you have never been put to the
true test —the test of poverty;
I think that you have had too much success,
and altogether too much money to throw
around;
I think that when the real trial comes, you
will be found a land quick to battle and
revolution;
I hope, for the sake of your dreams, that you
may have many revolutions;
I hope, for the sake of your spirit, that you
may have many desperate wars....
I think that humanity is in for a long period
of confusion, disappointment—a period
of transition;
I think that the world has yet to pass through
the Dark Ages of democracy, while
practice is catching up with theory ....
I have been trying to say that all this peace
which we make so much fuss about is
perfectly obvious preparation for war;
(So long as we want and have material
possessions, we will be fighting either to
gain or to hold;)
I have been trying to say that the fighting
of wars is our atonement for the making
of them in times of peace;
I have been trying to say that if we like this
peace, and if we enjoy the world as it
is, then we are cowards and hypocrites
to complaAn of _ war.
From “Vision of War,” by Lincoln Colcord
(Macmillan, New York, per Sydney
Book Club.)
Lincoln Colcord is wearing Whitman’*
goloshes, and they fit. His Vision of War
(Macmillan, per Sydney Book Club) is just
the sort of vision that Whitman would have
had had he been able to fire his poetry and
his platitudes at this war. Lincoln Col-
cord shows how horribly easy it is to be
Whitmanesque, once Whitman had shown the
way. Yet his vision, of which the above
extracts represent only a negligible portion,
is worth reading, though it would be rather
easier if this prose were printed as prose
and if the author knew a little more about
the art of punctuation. But in this, the
first, effort to compass in one poem the whole
aspect of modern war, Lincoln Colcord
is, to a surprising extent, successful. And
from his confused and haphazard pictures,
his lurid rhetoric and the annoying frequency
with which he remarks “I think” or “I say”
or merely “O,” there does emerge a definite
picture of the soul of this war, and of all
wars. Being a fellow-citizen of Whitman’s
he is blatantly neutral, but though he casti-
gates England for her faults of the past, he
has nothing but admiration for the Empire’s
present efforts, and he looks back sadly at a
Germany that is gone. But the poeyn (or
prose-work) is, above all, a glorification of
“this serious new game for earnest, grown-
up children.” For Lincoln Colcord this war
is necessary and right. The advent of this
champion to deliver the world from the stag-
nation of our enervating peace, was, in this
author’s opinion, long overdue. The book is
serious and sincere.
War
Rumor, or, maybe, that reliable corres-
pondent “Anon,” mentions that the average
life of any aeronaut in this war is
merely 50 hours: —50 hours in the air. As
an aeronaut on active service is llying,
on an average, but a small portion of
each day, this would give him from four
weeks to, say, a couple of months before he
became a casualty or a corpse. Flight-Lieut.
Harold Rosher, R.N., became a member of
the naval-air service in August, 1914, and
was killed on February 16, just 22 years old.
So he had, comparatively, a long life in the
air. But In the Royal Naval Air Service
(Chatto and Windus; 3s. 6d.), which con-
sists cf his letters to his family, one of the
most frequent items of interest is his report
of the disablement or death of his flying
chums.
Rosher was a charming English lad; and
his letters, obviously never meant for publi-
cation, give not only a graphic picture of the
perils and joys of air service in war, but
reveal a modest and most engaging person-
ality. They are interesting, also, for their
new slang—the slang of the air. It is a
remarkably expressive slang, full of quaint
humor. Rosher took part in many famous
raids, and was killed at the Dover Aero-
plane Station, whither he had been returned
from France for instructional purposes.
There, the morning of his death, lie found a
pilot ready to ascend .in a machine that
had not been tested. Rosher ordered the
pilot out, and himself took it up for a brief
trial flight. The cause of the accident that
followed was not discovered. As he wrote:
“If one goes on flying long enough, one is
bound to get huffed [killed] in the end.”
Here is a typical extract from one of his
letters: “I crashed into the atmosphere first
thing this morning and flipped around for
55 minutes 1 ended up with a hair-
splitting spiral, with the machine banked
up to about 55 degrees. I only did three or
four complete turns, but kept on until
I was scared stiff. When you bank a machine
over 45 degrees, your rudder turns into your
elevator and vice versa. To come out of a
spiral, you just shove everything the wrong
way round and wait and see what happens.
.... ” Rosher had one curious experience;
he was chased by a Zep. “I sighted the Zep-
pelin coming home over Zeebrugge. I turned
off due east to avoid being seen, intending to
wait until he came down and then to catch
him sitting. But my luck was out. One of
the searchlights picked me up, and anti-air-
craft guns immediately opened fire on me.
Then a curious thing happened. The Zeppe-
lin sighted me (I think the searchlights
were signalling) and immediately came for
me. This was the tables turned on me with
a vengeance, and the very last thing I ever
dreamt of. It was a regular nightmare.
I was only 6000 ft. up, and the Zep., which
was very fast, must have been 10,000 ft.
Without being able to get above it I was, of
course, helpless and entirely at the mercy
of his Maxim guns. We had ‘some’ race I
He tried to cut me off from Holland, but X
got across his bows. He was a huge big
thing, most imposing, and turned rapidly
with the greatest of ease. I hung around.. ~
climbing hard, and reached - 8500 ft., but the
Zep. wasn’t having any. He wasn’t coming
down while I was there, and I, on the other-
hand, couldn’t get up to him, as he had
risen to some fabulous height, so after a bit
I pushed off home, feeling very discontented
at such an unsatisfactory ending....”

Monica Cosens, who was one of the
“Miouws,” as the volunteer girls are called in
the munition factories of England, writes
brightly of her work in Lloyd George's
Munition Girls (Hutchinson, per Sydney
Book Club; Is.). It is very hard work, but
the spirit of these girls, most of whom are
of the “fact’ry ’ands” type, is remarkable.
And though these girls are engaged on men’s
work, they do not forget their sex. “It is
five minutes to one now, on the night shift.
The Khaki girls round me place their brown
cases on the ends of their machines, dive into
the depths and take out pieces of rag with
which to rub their besmeared faces. Next,
out come hand-mirrors, very beautiful things
in themselves, sometimes encircled with sea-
shells and sometimes mounted on blue plush,
which they poise against the lids of the cases
and stoop and bend before them as they tidy
their hair, powder their faces, touch up their
eyelashes ,and redden their lips. Conceited
little baggages, these Khaki girls! But, after
all, there are admirers in the factory, and it
would not do for them to appear at a dis-
advantage even though it is the middle of the
night!” And it is the greatest crime in the
eyes of a Khaki girl to be seen in the street
in any of her work-clothes. There are
fashions, too, in the workshop. “Lately....
many hands have discarded the frilly caps
in favor of red and yellow, or pink and green
bandana handkerchiefs, and the khaki over-
alls for those of butcher blue.” In the
author’s factory there was a great deal of
talk about “the proper smart kiddies up on
the hill” —Miss Tommy Atkins was refer-
ring to .Billjim’s camp close by. There was
hardly a girl who did not wear the regi-
mental badge belonging to one or another of
the Australian regiments. And “young Else
got spliced to an Orstralian this afternoon.”
Monica Cosens deplores the fact that the
strain of the night-shift is beginning to tell
on the health of the girls. “We oUlose our
looks here,” said one to her. “But what
does it matter if we do?” she went on.
“That’s better than losing a leg or an arm.
And what does it matter if a few of us do
get killed off? There are too many of us
already.” “So she goes on, as they all go
on—because they can go on. They are not
doing work beyond their endurance. They
can carry on, but it means an effort, and it is
not until the end of the war, when the
reaction sets in, that they will realise how
tired they are.”
Would women like these have voted No?
Carolyn Wells in The Century cheer-
fully offers her Salt River Anthology, in
imitation of Edgar Lee Masters’ famous, or
notorious, Spoon River Anthology. Here is
“Alice Ben Bolt”
I couldn’t help weeping with delight
When the boys kissed me and called me sweet.
It was foolish, I know,
To weep when 1 was glad;
But I was young and I wasn’t very well.
I was nervous, weak and anaemic,
A sort of human mimosa; and I hadn’t much brains,
And my minff wouldn’t jell, anyhow.
That’s why I trembled with fear when they frowned,
But they didn’t frown often,
For I was sweetly pretty and most pliable.
But, oh, the grim joke of asking Ben Bolt if he
remembered me 1
Me! .
Why, it was Ben Bolt who—
Well, never mind. He paid for this granite slab,
And it’s as stylish as any in the church-yard.
But I wish I had a more becoming shroud.
And, of course, the rather overworked
“Blessed Damosel”; —
I was one of those long, lanky, loose-jointed girls
Who fool people into believing
They are willowy and psychic and mysterious.
I was always hungry; I never ate enough to satisfy
me,
For fear I’d get. fat.
Oh, how little the world knows of the bitterness of
life
To a woman who tries to keep thin!
Many thought I died of a broken heart,
But it was of an empty stomach.
Then Mr. Rossetti wrote about me.
He described me all dolled up in some ladies’ wear-
ing apparel
That I wore at a fancy ball.
I had fasted all day, and had had my hair marcelled
And my face corrected.
And I was a dream.
But he seemed to think he really saw me,
Seemed to think I appeared to him after my death.
Oh, fudge!
These spiritualists are always seeing things!
And “Little Eva”:-
To be honest,
I didn’t mind dying.
For I had .y.
One of these here now
Dressy deaths.
It was staged, you know,
And, like Samson,
My death brought down the house.
I was a smarty kid,
And they were less frequent then than later.
Oh, I was the Mary Pickford of my time,
And I rest content
With my notoriety.
And, as Carolyn Wells has overlooked
Ginger MicJc, be shall speak for himself: —
’Striith, it’s a fair cow,
The way that bioke Dennis ’as treated me 1
I never even ’eard of the beggar down Spadger’s
Lane;
’B never showed his blanky dial there —
Or, if ’e did, ’e never ’ad the luck ter strike met
That blok® in my push ?
Come orf! . : .
Wot sort of a time ’ud Rosie give me if she seen me
with a poet-bloke for a cobber?
Next thing the cops ’ud be astin’ the Push ter teal
I knoo ’e wrote a lot er kid about a sentiblankimental
bloke ‘ : - -
And, ’strath, that’s orl this Dennis coot is!
But 1 ain’t never met one in the Push.
It’s tough luck, my oath!
Any’ow I’m orl right ’ere at Lonesome Pine:
It’s a long way from Spadger’s Lane,
But it’s a blanky sight further from that cow!
Square an’ orl, the bullet that outed me at Lonesome
Pine
the best bit er luck that Ginger Mick ever-
struck— ■■ . -
An’ the luckiest thing that ever ’appened
To that Dennis coot!
Me dirty left!
Me blanky oath!
WHAT THE SOLDIER READS.
“Red Cross” tells of Tommy’s taste for
literature: I was sorting out books to take to
the wards, in England, one day, and the
orderly helping me nearly had a heart attack
when I sniffed at a bundle of “comics” —the
sort the very young Australian boys spend
their pennies on. “Why, sister,” he said,
“they are just the thing the chaps will
rush.” And they did—“not ’arf”! One
patient, reading For the Term _of His
Natural Life, preferred “to stick it” than go
for a drive. Magazines are the most popu-
lar, as longer stories can’t be indulged in
in wards where there are so many distrac-
tions, and I guess the trenches would be the
same. V
The Conservatorium Magazine, edited
by Iloland Foster, the official organ of the
N. S. Wales Conservatorium of Music (Gov-
ernment Printer, Sydney; 6d.), gives good
literary and musical value for the money.
It happily lacks the dreariness of the usual
educational production; it is almost bright;
it is well illustrated. The enthusiasm that
pervades this excellent State institution is
evidently responsible for this production. The
next issue is announced for Deeemhw.

IMPORTANT,
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be coEh-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel,
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is. therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S ‘FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

MR. GEORGE GOODMAN.
The following testimony is from Mr.
George Goodman, better known as
“Goody” in the profession, and one of
the most widely and professionally
known of a band of brilliant theatrical
managers who form an artistic link
between the theatrical past and
present.
Mr. Goodman has been associated with
the present firm of J. C. Williamson,
Ltd., for a long number of years, ex-
tending back to its inception, when
as “Williamson, Garner and Mus-
grove,” it occupied, as it does to-day,
the foremost position in the theatrical
world of Australia, and was respon-
sible for the finest imported produc-
tions of Grand Opera and versatile
drama and comedy.
Mr. Goodman’s experience with these
productions and association with the
many “stars” imported under the Wil-
liamson management, is proverbial,
and the following letter will be of
considerable interest to the many
members of the theatrical profession
throughout the Commonwealth, who,
physically exhausted by the exacting
nature of their many roles, will find
in the medicine Mr. Goodman advo-
cates a nerve rejuvenator and health
restorer of remarkable power and cer-
tainty. Mr. Goodman writes from his
Sydney residence thus: —■
BEVERLY, BAYSWATER ROAD,
DARLINGHURST, 20/9/’l6.
CLEMENTS TONIC Ltd.
I know the horrors of insomnia, or lack of refreshing sleep as well as any
who have suffered acutely from it.
I have endured it often, combined with an irritable, excited and weakened
nerVe condition that almost ruined my health. I am not wrong in stating that
this condition at times almost incapacitated me from my managerial duties.
But I experienced a pleasing and grateful change after taking the medicine
I was advised to use—Clements Tonic. After taking it, that change may be
summarised thus
X. Sweet, refreshing sleep EVERY NIGHT.
2. Real healthy appetite.
3. True enjoyment of life through being absolutely well, which X
attribute to no other source than this remarkable medicine to which
I testify.
I am, Sirs

Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERYBODY COMPLAINING.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
crease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
he has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease: Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, puffiness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy.

chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause—-the poisonous uric acid. Remem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color—a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
other* —you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill—straight to the kidneys—that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief—every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or bow badly
von have suffered.

MOST MEN would cure themselves of the
Tobacco habit if they knew they could
do so easily and without discomfort. ’
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to

TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless, vege-
table remedy that will make the user of
tobacco in any form absolutely abandon the

The Cruel Wind of Springtime.
With dry eyes, aching, pressed against the
pillow,
And thwarted bosom heaving in the dark,
She felt the soft sweet breath of murm’rous
Springtime
Steal like a little ghost in from the park.
“O cruel little ghost!” she said, “you haunt
me
With visions of a future ne’er to be,
With dreams of joy and toil and shouting
children
And all my gallant lover meant for me.”
She sees him lying cold in far-off Flanders —•
One hero more has played the better part.
But wails of tender little spirit children
Pierce the sad darkness round her lonely
heart.

S. RAVENSCROFT.
The Peacock.
Below the terrace urns of roses glowing
The wide walk spread, a riband of hot
gold,
And there the peacock met me, proudly
showing
His jewelled breast, right gorgeous to
behold,
Demanding like a king my humble duty,
Fit homage to his most surpassing beauty.
But clear above his splendor I saw shining
Two eyes of changeful emerald and blue,
A garland of gay tresses intertwining
About the fairest face I ever knew,
A mocking mouth that smiled not too un-
kindly.
I passed the bird uncivilly, and blindly.
My Lady stood beneath the crimson roses,
Herself a rarer rose, more fine, more pale;
I said: “While his fierce heart the sun dis-
closes
My lips shall tell to yours a fiery tale.”
But as we paced the path of gold together
Meseemed too bright the treacherous June
weather,
Too sweet the burden of the roses’ sighing,
Too sapphire-deep the sky that shone that
noon
On Eglantina, petulantly crying
“This gravel burns me through my satin
shoon!
Let us walk thither where the boughs are
shady.”
I entered the dim pinewood with my Lady.
Only the dusky solitudes were round us;
Somewhere unseen there moaned a woo-
ing dove;
Never a more hour had found
us;
The very air was passionate with love —
When sudden, through the ring-dove’s
scarce-heard singing,
The harsh screams of the peacock came a-
ringing.
“Beauty and Vanity you scorned unheed-
ing"—
Thus I interpreted the curse, alack —
“Beauty and Vanity shall leave you bleed-
ing!"
But Eglantina laughed: “We will go back.
Fear not, Faint Heart, that cry of wrath
and sorrow;
He would but have us know ’twill rain to-
morrow.”
* * * *
I watch the rose-leaves fall, wind-torn and
sodden;
My Lady’s eyes are turned another way.
Grey mists enshroud the terrace walks un-
trodden ;
My Lady’s locks have snared a newer
prey.
New lips teach hers my interrupted story...
The rain has drowned out all the golden
glory.

Plainte D’Amour.
Let be, delicious girl,
And cease to pet and tempt me!
My heart’s too worn to whirl,
My years should sure exempt me
From taxes that I paid,
Out-passing far my duty,
Ere I was wise and staid,
To wheedling youth and beauty.
Your mouth that masters mine
When you demurely curve it.
Turns all my blood to wine,
And how can I deserve it?
I’m old, you jade, I’m old,
My style’s the sere and yellow.
These ringlets of burnt-gold '
Are for some sprightlier fellow.
The dimples that adorn
Your shoulders and such places
Shrine each a Cupid born
To trip the sidling Graces;
But bald and graceless I,
An unrepentant fogey,
And soon I must espy
Approaching Death, that bogey.
Kissed, I will kiss again
In admirable fashion;
Nor need I yet to feign
The joys and toys of passion.
But life’s glad sphere for you
Is rounded in completeness:
Mine’s chipped and thumbed askew....
Ah, do not waste your sweetness!
Ere I was wise and staid,
To wheedling youth and beauty
The taxes that I paid
Out-passed by far my duty.
But now from life’s hot whirl
My years should sure exempt me....
Let be, delicious girl,
And cease to coax and tempt me!

of Nature, should turn to Nature’s forces
when he requires power. The mighty
Niagara was harnessed for man’s benefit.
The discovey of vast Petroleum fields pre-
sented similar opportunities. The crude
Petroleum would not serve man sufficiently
well, so he distilled it —refined it—harri-
essed it to hr'is needs. The result is “Plume”
Motor Spirit, a most powerful driving force.

“WHEN IT WAS DARK.”
,N that zigzag motion which it calls evolu-
ion, and in those circular sweeps which it
describes as progress, the world eddies and
halts and bows and pirouettes to a great
extent round certain ideas and formulas
which from time to time win general accept-
ance. One of the most important of these
is the notion that democracy is kind, that its
rough hand has a womanly tenderness
about it, and that shames and wrongs perpe-
trated by individuals in power and high
places would never be tolerated by the mass
of the people if they were once raised to the
full height of democratic authority. This
faith is not usually stated in words, but it
is left to be inferred whenever wider fran-
chises and popular control are under dis-
cussion ; and it is the pivot on which the
whole modern State turns. Despots may be
good or bad. If they are good—as they have
shown themselves to be two or three times
in the long history of the world —all the
garden breaks into fresh bloom, if they are
bad —as they usually are—the whole
national landscape becomes a howling desert
bursting out into spots of sheer hell. But
the soi.d conviction remains that democracy
is always good in intention, that the mass of
the people thinking as a whole will think no
wrong, and that no large body of citizens
would ever of themselves combine to injure
the community for purely selfish ends. Take
this faith aw r ay, prove it to be wrong in
essence, and there is no argument to be ad-
vanced for democracy. Government by the
few must always be easier than government
by the. many; and if the many govern no
more kindly, to place the rule in their hands
is manifestly absurd.
* * * *
Some years ago the reading public met a
mild literary sensation at the bookstalls,
when a writer of pious melodrama came
along . with a yarn called “When It Was
Dark.” The obscurity was caused by
the supposed discovery of the tomb of Jesus
Christ with the original bones in it. Imme-
diately the Christian religion was alleged to
have collapsed. Its central notion was gone;
the miracle of the Resurrection was proved
a gigantic fake ; and from Moody and Sankey
to the Archbishop of Canterbury and the
Pope all the pious world stopped praying,
choked on the last verse of the anthem, and
felt that the bottom had fallen out of the
cosmos. All morality was gone; Heaven’s
gate was shut with a loud bang; nothing of
all that was supposed to matter most was
worth bothering about. Of course, for the
purpose of the yarn, the light came back
again, and the fraudulent bones were re-
moved, while the scientific devil who had
planned and carried out the whole affair got
something of what was coming to him. Still,
there was a lot in the central idea. The
empty tomb and the solemn angels who
watched while Peter and Mary paid their
morning visit lay at the foundation of a
mighty mass of divinity, and gave form to
all the creeds. To pull away that underpin-
ning was to bring down a toppling mass of
church spires and mitres and bishops’ gaiters
and pew rents and presbyteries and altar
decorations and mission boards —in fact, the
whole lock, stock and barrel of a dozen eccle-
siastical systems. They all rested on an
idea, and once the idea was gone they were
like prudence without a chaperon or a fish-
shop bankrupt of ice.
Just as the great systems into which the
Christian religion is crystallised rest on the
fundamental belief in the Resurrection, so
democracy stands on the belief that kindly
human sympathy animates the mass of men.
Just now that kindly human sympathy is in
grave doubt. We are in the dark, politically
as well as after seyen o’clock. The black-
ness of our city streets through the coal
strike is typical of the attitude of a large
section of our alleged democracy towards all
the rest. To them it is nothing that a big
part of the public is gravely inconvenienced,
that a lot of people are already wondering
whether they can continue to make ends
meet, and that famine, striking at the little
children, may leap on the towns at any
moment. There is no kindliness in the
striker’s method. He neither trusts the
people nor considers their needs; and if his
attitude represents the spirit of the demo-
cracy, it is plain that the bones are in the
tomb, and that the world’s big hopes are
quenched in a very thick darkness. It might,
of course, be argued that the striker, from
definite and exalted notions of right, was
prepared to nail himself together with all the
rest of the people on a cross of suffering to
inaugurate something kindlier, higher and
holier in the future. But there is no indi-
cation at all of this. On the evidence, he
is ready to inflict any suffering on his fellow
citizens to gain a victory on a comparatively
small point—a victory that with a very little
exercise of patience could have been won
without serious loss or inconvenience to any-
body. No one credits the mine-owners, who
are the other parties to the shame of holding
up the public, with any altruistic motives.
The owners are frankly out. for gain, and
have never professed to be either kindly in
spirit or anxious for the public good ; yet
their action in the national crisis compares
favorably with those of the men who do pro-
fess to believe that the rule of the people
makes for the greatest good of the greatest
number. With the finding of the body in the
tomb the Christian system was alleged to
have fallen. Who is to say that with the
finding that the idea behind democracy is a
myth the w r hole structure of ballot-boxes,
leagues, unions, parliaments and the like
does not come down with a run, and that
Australia’s voice may not be heard insist-
ently demanding one strong man with a
whip to take charge of everything? Demo-
cracy is on its trial. If it has no good feel-
ing towards itself, nothin? can save it from
deserved destruction. Somewhere out of the
gloom a livht may suddenly flash forth and a
glory of high and kindly purpose animate the
mass of men now bent on the ruin of their
fellow workers; but at present it is very
dark, and the price even of feeble candles
has gone up a halfpenny per pound.
THE ENEMY IN THE HOUSE.
If the coal-owners shut down the mines,
threw thousands of people out of work,
plunged the public and private, enterprises of
the country into chaos, and forced the in-
offensive citizen to cook his meals on a fork
in the back yard, the yell from an outraged
nation would blow the roof off. If in addi-
tion to doing these things the aforesaid
owners offended against the community
while they were parties to legal proceedings,
and further announced that they were deter-
mined not to argue about the matter, and
that the Court and the community could go
to blazes, the subsequent proceedings would
be swift and definite. Seven Parliaments
would rush into special session, there would
be earnest talk about rescuing a vitally-
necessary commodity from the clutches of a
gang of pirates, the community’s interest in the
coal deposits would find immediate recogni-
tion, and amidst the applause of an infuri-
ated populace Fat would be torn from his
place of authority and treated as a public
enemy. There may at times be moral differ-
ences between such an outrageous abuse of
power by colliery owners and the action of
miners in goinsr out on strike. Where the
workers have a solid grievance, and have
exhausted the means at their disposal in
vain effort to get it remedied, this is cer-
tainly the case. But so far as the perform-
ance now in progress throughout Australia
is concerned, this paper has searched, with-
out success, for a reason why it should feel
happy because the community is being
throttled by the miners instead of by the
bosses.
* * * *
The claims that the men have made may
be proper. They may not. There is no way
of determining the point until the case has
been stated and replied to, and all the rele-
vant facts investigated. The bald asser-
tion that the men are striking _ for “eight
hours” settles nothing, because it leaves a
lot out of the calculation. What they cer-
tainly did was to ask the Arbitration Court
to place a special construction on “eight
hours,” and while the claim was pending
knocked-off work and started to find out if
they were strong enough to do without the
Court. The Bulletin expresses no opinion
about the claims of the miners on the colliery
proprietors, because the evidence is not forth-
coming. It does not believe that at the
moment they are of much importance, any-
way, or that they are the real foundation of
this disturbance. But this paper has very
strong opinions about the miners’ withdrawal
of their claims from settlement by decent,
civilised means; about their reckless blow at
thousands of other workers; their clamorous
resolution to prove that Labor is a cannibal;
the flagrant dishonesty of their talk about
being “refused justice” when they are sub-
jecting, without cause, the whole body of
Australian citizenship to injustices of the
grossest kind. Taking all the circumstances
of the day and hour into consideration, this
hold-up of the coal supply is an anti-social
act which no good Australian or sane Labor
man can view without much regret and some
disgust. The full' tragedy of the thing is not
on the surface.
* * * *
The position would be different if the com-
munity’s interest in the mining industry had
been disregarded by Parliament and the
electors— if the miners were working under
conditions for which their fellow-citizens had
shown themselves disinclined to accept re-
sponsibility. But it is not so. The Aus-
tralian miner has received from the people
of Australia more than the miner anywhere
else in the world, and he has answered by
striking a heavy blow at the worker in other
callings and at the country’s institutions. To
say that he was compelled to do this because
the community refused him justice is wickedly
untrue. It is a scandalous libel on the Aus-
tralian democracy to assert that the miners
of the country could only get a fair deal by
making war upon the State. What is indis-
putable is that the miners have repudiated the
claims and rights of the rest of the commu-
nity, declared that the State has no other
function than to enforce their demands on the
spot, and have set out to measure their
strength as industrial and political bullies.
If that were not the case, why decline to
accept the mediation of the State and take
up the bludgeon and the sandbag instead?
The public has heard of resolutions being
passed congratulating these “wage slaves”
on their magnificent demonstration of soli-
darity in “fighting for a great principle.”
The solidarity can be readily admitted, but
The Bulletin doubts whether a fight to
uppercut Labor principles looks any better
because a section of organised Labor is the
assailant than if Fat was guilty of it.
Nothing that has happened during the last
week or two changes the view of this paper
that the interests of the general body of the
people and of the nation are of more import-
ance than the affairs of the coal-owners or of
the miners or of any other section of the indus-
trial outfit. That theory is at the bottom of
all social progress, and will survive denials
by every combination of capitalists and
Labor unions on earth. Any action on the
part of Capital or Labor or the State rest-
ing on other considerations must in the end
be fatal to the cause in which it is taken.
A community that can be terrorised by a crowd
in moleskins is no better off than one that
can be driven by a mob in silk hats. Nor is
Labor using the advantages granted to it by
law to strangle the communal life and sand-
bag the industrial activities of a State
any more pleasant to contemplate than
Capital engaged on a same contract.
Strikes are. as foreign to the spirit which
gave birth to the better conception of citizen-
ship as retention of the duel would be where
a police court flourishes. And any settle-
ment of the present trouble except through
negotiation between the parties on the lines
contemplated by the Arbitration Act will in
the long run be a bad thing for Labor, and a
blow at the political and social ideals for
which Labor is supposed to stand.
AN APOLOGY FOR WINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Between Genoa and Turin and on the
watersheds of the Garonne, Dordogne and
Gironde, winter shows the serried rows of
dried sticks which next spring buds, summer
ripens, and autumn reaps in the wine that
is the life of man —a resurrection of the
dead, as Greece ascribed the vintage to the
blood of Dionysius. Old Noah, too,
built his boat, and, in the comforting vanity
that he had saved the world, planted his
vineyard, pressed the new wine and drank
it in celebration. The accidental fermenta-
tion of wild honey was the beginning of
mead which is the father of all beer ; but the
cultivation of the grape which is long to
maturity began the scientific agriculture
which is the beginning of civilisation. To
forget wine is to forget half of early chem-
istry. These old monks and alchemists,
searching for a universal solvent, found alco-
hol. the universal element, present in air,
fresh water and all vegetable matter; pre-
sent in the human body naturally; giving
even a reaction from clay, so that the pro-
hibitionist and the extreme wowser, being
dead, must either be burned by alcoholic
wood or buried in alcoholic earth.
The truth is, though, that the prohibi-
tionist and the extreme wowser are not
against alcohol, but against anybody who
requires and can absorb more alcohol than
they themselves. Some teetotallers are con-
tent with the alcohol of ginger-beer, others
with the alcohol derived from lollies)
Another requires a liquor of six or 10 or 15
per cent.; yet shall the first two demand
that the third shall get his alcohol in ginger-
beer and lollies or be prohibited of any. And
the teetotallers who drink patent medicines,
many of them of greater alcoholic strength
than most wines and many whiskies, are as
intolerant as the ginger-beer and lolly drunk-
ards. If the people with the greater powers
of alcoholic absorption were to talk of for-
cibly feeding the prohibitionists and the
wowser with drinks of high alcoholic
strength, as they might logically do in re-
taliation, there w T ould be a revolution.
Meantime of all alcoholic drinks the wines
of Australia are expected to be most apolo-
getic in their own country, although they
boldly offer themselves and are appreciated
abroad. The finest aid the teetotallers can
give to temperance is to help these
wines against the heavily-alcoholised
spirits of the old world, which health,
climate and experience should make the
Australian shun. Yet so slowly do the old
bad habits die that even the teetotallers are
more ready to tolerate 20 per cent, alcohol
in an imported gin than to see our own
light wines reach their proper position as a
beverage of the table in the home.
If any fair man is asked to point to the
sanest, most artistic, most sober and most
patriotic nation of the earth he will turn
immediately to France. And the French
consumption of wine per head is 30.8 gal-
lons per year, as against 25.1 gallons for
Italy, 18.5 for Spain and 17.1 gallons for
Portugal, the other conspicuously sober
nations of Europe. A long way after them
comes Austria with 3.9 gallons, and then
the two heavy-drinking nations, Germany
with 1.45 gallons and Britain with one-third
of a gallon. Despite the comparative new-
ness of the industry and the dead hand of
imported habit, Australia does better than
these with 1.30 gallons per head. When
Australia reaches the Italian figure Aus-
tralians will be one of the most sober peoples
of the earth.
The Champagne country of France covers
the country of the Marne, Haute Marne,
Aube and Ardennes, that beautiful region
of which much has been laid waste by the
beer-drinking German. A pity that the
fighting was not in a distillery or a ginger-
beer factory! Champagne as a wine was
discovered when Don Perignon, of the
abbey near Hautvilliers, invented the use
of cork as a bottle-stopper, thereby confining
the carbonic-acid gas. Then, of course, be-
cause nobody else had thought of corks, the
little wowsers of the time said that the
wine of Champagne was an invention of the
Devil and had come direct from Hell. And
champagne is a wine that is the Devil to a
full-blooded man, filling his veins with fish-
hooks. The Australians as a meat-eating
race are generally full-blooded, wherefore the
wines demanded for them are the light
clarets of certain valleys in the Eastern
States of Australia, and the hocks of. sun-
light, color and bouquet like the air of
Riverina.
Bordeaux takes our heavy wines by
the million gallons and sends it out again,
but not as Australian. The beverage wines
of the Garonne, Dordogne and Gironde—to
take the most representative of the wine
regions—are grown on light soils of gravel,
limestone, iron and clay. Australia, the oldest
country geologically on earth, has soils
stronger than those of Europe, where almost
every cultivable acre has been worked and
cropped and triturated for at least a cen-
tury or two. Our soils of lime and iron
produce clarets that are a burgundy, and
burgundies as strong as ports. But down
in many river valleys, where time and
weather and water-action have sifted and
diluted the calcareous and ferruginous soils
to silt, grow the wines that shall make Aus-
tralia a sober wine drinker and not a heavy
consumer of ardent spirits. The vineyards
are in existence and increasing; it only
requires the quicker education of public
opinion to bring the increased trade which
will provide the profit, and that in turn will
permit the general application of the only
betterment our Australian wine manufactu-
rer generally requires—the money (which
means the time) to give the wine a decent
age.
In Tuscany, where the grape is the chief
beauty of the three productive seasons of
life —the cirrous vines are there trained in
orchards from tree to tree because land is
dear —poverty makes the peasants drink in
January the wine of November. Probably
for this reason olive oil is used so freely, as
a corrective as much as a food. But Aus-
tralia is not poor, and with a great demand
there is no reason why the commonest bev-
erage wine should not be two years old
before it comes to table. The teetotallers
of South Australia directed much of their
hatred to all wines because of “pinky,” the
new vat-juice which was really not a wine
at all. But the wowser public opinion which
governs all that a man shall drink, while
caring nothing for the quality of that he
shall eat, has been against the marketing of
wine under proper conditions, in the very
correct fear that proper conditions of sale
would give the national beverage a national
popularity. In all Sydney there are prob-
ably not a dozen decent wineshops ; the
great bulk of them are run as a side-line by
harpies who bring in two other harpies to
drink out of the gentleman’s bottle —with
“Another kind love, my dear!” And the
wowsers prefer such conditions to decent
ways of retailing which would give the
national drink the result of its merits.
And its merits must win, in face of the
bad old habits of the old world that are
naturally opposed to sane life in Australia,
in face of the opposition of the drinker of
alcohol who finds his alcohol in lollies and
ginger- beer, and calls himself a teetotaller
for that reason.
This, which began as an apology for Aus-
tralian wines, ends as an apology for the
liquor-control authority; for the blind re-
formers who fight the good of the liquor
question as well as the evil of it; and for
the conservative w r ho drinks heavy spirits of
the North Atlantic in a temperate zone. All
these intentional and tacit oppositionists of
Australian wines are keeping thousands of
acres of vineyard out of cultivation in favor
of a few ships carrying whisky and gin, and
of the few wharf-lumpers who sling the kegs
and cases from hold to wharf. The fact that
the money for most of these un-Australian
drinkings is sent out of Australia doesn’t
seem to matter; but all the /ssame it needs an
apology of its very own. ■ }

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Constitutional Protection of a
Decorative Myth.
The P.L.L. having presented a petition to
Governor Stkickxand urging him to refuse
assent to the Bill prolonging the life of
the N. S. Wales Assembly, Premier Hol-
man. worked off some jocose remarks about
the inconsistency of people who urged the
abolition of the office of State Governor and
yet appealed to the Cocked Hat for assist-
ance. Why? There was nothing the mat-
ter with the P.L.L. petitioning the Gover-
nor, and no sane person ever suggested that
if the post of Governor was abolished the
constitutional place it allegedly occupies
should be left a gaping void for tricky poli-
ticians to conceal themselves in beyond
reach of the electors. As long as the State
has a Governor exercising certain func-
tions or pretending to, the electors who
believe that these activities should be exer-
cised through another agency have no more
to be. ashamed of in conforming with con-
stitutional procedure than in obeying a
law they believe to be unjust. That the
petition was a futility was not the fault
of the P.L.L. It had to appeal to an offi-
cial appointed by an outside authority and
bound down to accept the advice of Min-
isters even where this involves stealing
the people’s votes —all of which merely
goes to strengthen the case against
the Cocked Hat as an institution. It is
worse than useless. Under a more rational
system the P.L.L. would have been able
to lodge a document in the Supreme Court
calling on Holman to show cause why he
should not be restrained from prigging the
ballot-box; or, what would be even better,
the electors on petition would be able to
force the . Assembly to resign. As things
are, the citizens have no protection against
Parliament; and as institutions which are
responsible only to themselves are sure to
become tyrannies, the sooner the electors
wake up to the need for the referendum-
initiative the better. In the name of Demo-
cracy the Cocked Plat has been converted into
a constitutional myth-—and myths are not
much good to people who have to deal with
politicians. Anything less than a axe is a
nuisance.
«
Wanted—An Official Executioner.
The patience of the Australian people in the
hands of the looters and messers who are
running the country’s affairs is as amazing
as their readiness to go off into hysterics
about the price of cream of tartar. Every
day the evidence is accumulating that in each
State and in the Federal domain there is
waste of the most appalling character. The
evidence taken lately by the Commission in-
quiring into the state of affairs at Canberra
reads like the story of an organised effort
to reduce the taxpayers to beggary. This is
what the chief storekeeper of the Melbourne
Metropolitan Board of Works, who was
instructed to visit the scene, 1 reports that
he found: —
The value of the plant and stores was £88,274.
Although work had been in progress for some years
it was only recently that anything like a record of
the goods received had been made, with the result
that it was extremely difficult to trace anything
purchased prior to March, 1916. At present (exclu-
sive of material on outside works, purchases for
stock, cement, timber, fencing material and plant),
there was lying at the dep6t, unused, material to
the value of over £28,000. The bulk of this
material had either been ordered in excess of re-
quirements, or when received found unsuitable for
the works. In many cases similar material had
been ordered for new works when the material there
might have been used if proper supervision had been
exercised.... A large and valuable stock of elec-
trical materials was lying at the depot. Much of
it had been kept on hand for a considerable time.
No record was kept of it when used, the men
taking what they required without check of any
kind....
Early in the history of the Federal Territory
several contracts were let, for various kinds of
timber, with the object of having seasoned timber
available for the works. No steps were taken to
make proper provision for storing this material, and
even the ordinary precautions were not taken. In
those circumstances it was not to be wondered at
that a large quantity of it would be absolutely
wasted. In addition, a large proportion of it was
affected with dry rot and insects.
Owing to the careless manner in which the cement
was stacked, before an accurate tally could be taken
a large proportion of it had to be shifted and
restacked. It was found ! on comparing the tally
with the cards that there was a discrepancy of 4663
bags. Under present conditions there was practically
no supervision or control over the stores and plant.
And so it goes on. Every time an investi-
gation is made of the working of a State
or Federal department there is the same
yarn of waste and muddle and loss. If
Private Enterprise was forming himself into
trusts and combines to loot the public the
electors would rise up in their might and
drive out the politicians who allowed the
steal to go on. Yet all this Government
waste represents a steal as gigantic as any-
thing ever perpetrated at Chicago. Every
Prime Minister and Premier invents a new
portfolio or two. This paper implores the
next man to appoint a Minister equipped
with a guillotine and statutory authority
to use it on public servants who rob their
masters at a time when, of all others, they
ought to most sedulously guard their inter-
ests.
The Hun’s Attack on J. Bull’s Butcher
and Baker.
It seems as if it is going to be the Corned
Beef of Old England this Christmas, and
for a day or two later. The Hun submarine
is knocking a large hole in John’s pantry,
and it is no good pretending that the per-
formance makes the situation look any more
cheerful. Perhaps John sees already that it
would be very much better for him if he
had contracted the habit of raising his own
steak instead of pheasants. An abattoir in
the Highlands would nowadays be a lot
more useful than a Yankee millionaire’s
shooting box, and animals that could be
driven in by a dog preferable to wide,
branching horns which have to be pursued
with telescope and rifle. But regrets on
that subject are nc\t going to keep John’s
belt tight, and there is nothing for it but a
systematic distribution of the tucker that
escapes the Hun’s torpedo. How much
pinch under the waist-line is being felt in
Britain in consequence of inflated prices
and vanished cargoes is a matter for specula-
tion. Probably not much —yet. But the six-
penny egg. the appointment of a Food
Commission, the promulgation of regula-
tions about the use of flour, the intimation
conveyed to hotelkeepers that they must
carve the menu down, and Walter
Runciman’s warning that there may be
fishless and meatless days ahead, all point
to the conclusion that large appetites are
not the nation’s most valuable asset just
now ; and the production of munitions for the
community’s innards appears not unlikely
to become as great a problem as the produc-
tion of shells for the guns on the Somme.
All these things ought to have some mean-
ing for us in Australia. If they don’t
satisfy us of the extreme seriousness of the
position nothing can do it. Yet matters will
almost certainly go on getting more serious;
wherefore the urgency of hitting swiftly
with all our strength. The reinforcements
we send away a year hence, two years
hence, may be too late.
The Union that Destroys Strength.
Of the antis who lately complained that the
war is robbing the country of industrial
workers, not one has been heard to suggest
that their non-enlisted brothers, who run no
risk of losing life or limb in the trenches,
should at least be willing to lose a little
recreation, or put more industry into their
ordinary daily work. There is but one way
to make up the deficit in national production
due to the exodus of workers who were ready
and willing to fight for Civilisation, and that
is by increasing the output of the workers
who remain in the Commonwealth. It is
for them to say whether they prefer to work
longer or work stronger, and it is time that
they admitted themselves in honor bound to
adopt one or other alternative. There is a
lamentable rule of loafing in most of the
factories of Private Enterprise; but in those
cases the taxation falls only on the profits
of the individual employers. The slacking
in Government employ, on the other hand,
falls on the incomes of taxpayers in general. It
is wicked slacking very often, but the truth
about it is never fully revealed in Parlia-
ment or on the platform, because the publica-
tion of details would bring wrath upon
the informers’ heads. In many cases, the very
foreman whose duty it should be to keep slack-
ers up to the mark has no compunction about
bringing an honest worker down to the rogue’s
level. Yet Treasurers, whilst imposing new
taxation to meet further expenditure, have
the audacity to declare that economy is being
duly studied. The scandal cannot go on for
ever. The war debts which this country is
incurring must be paid by increased produc-
tion of wealth. Australia must work harder
without necessarily forfeiting its claim to be
the workers’ paradise. If the present bosses
of trades unionism are committed to the Go
Slow doctrine, and cannot be dissuaded from
prostituting a noble cause to the requirements
of. ignoble hangers-on. the Governments,
being the biggest employers of labor, must
fight the tyrants instead of being co,wed by
them. At the present time, under Slacker
rule, Australian unionists are living in a
fools’ paradise rather than the paradise of
the working man.

The Cost of Living—and of Wasting.
The latest promise by Hughes is to do
something or other to prevent the price of
commodities soaring up further and to shield
the community from the high freight curse.
This paper wishes him luck. It is easy to
talk about, anyway. But there are one or two
matters which no amount of conversation
regarding the cauliflower and the rasher
should be allowed to obscure. The amount
the public has to pay for food and rent and
other things is important, but the quantity
of cash that is taken from the people’s wages
by way of taxation is something they are
equally interested in. Hughes ought to
look into this business and investigate some
of the expenditure of public money by his
own and the six other Ministries. He will
there find evidence of an extravagance
unparalleled in the history of the country.
While Australia has been engaged in war,
heaping up an enormous debt, the Federal
and other Governments have gone wildly on
increasing their 'expenditure from month to
month. To permit this lunacy to proceed, and
at the same time babble about the high price
of bread and chops and American salmon,
would look about as sensible as to climb on
top of a locomotive boiler and maunder about
the high temperature. Hughes may be able
to do something in the way of keeping some
prices down. It will be a big contract, and
involves getting right down to the rockbottom
of production and distribution. But any-
thing he may do in that direction will be a
futility unless the shocking waste of the
public estate and national earnings now in
progress is checked. Hughes knows this,
and The Bulletin has no reason to suspect
that he does not foresee the squall Australia
is going to be swept by. But it would like
to be sure that he has the grit to start cut-
ting the top hamper away before the storm
breaks. If he has not, his experiments as a
price-fixer are going to be of less service to
Australia than a shower of rain.

Coal is Black.
The accident by which somebody discovered
a coal seam instead of stumbling on the
principle of deriving electricity from waste
water-power has been responsible for a heap
of things—including the big strike which
has been barking the shins of the Common-
wealth. Coal is supposed to play a big part
in civilisation, but it is difficult to see, in
spite. of all the wheels that are set flying by
coal-induced steam, how anyone can argue
that the coal-miner is taking his place as a
civilised man. Dirty, always dirty, with
smarting eyes and roughened hands and, a
raw chest, he is shut away for long hours
from sun and air and all that gives sweet-
ness and color to life; and if after years of
that sort of thing he isn’t the gentlest and
most contented person in the State, the fact
seems in no way remarkable. If this old
world is to get any sort of decent move on
in the direction even of a very second-class
millennium it will have to concern itself about
eliminating some of the rougher varieties of
toil. While any large proportion of the citi-
zens of a democratic State are engaged in
work of a degrading nature —of a degrading-
nature because it lowers the human standard
and shuts its victims out from the finer
things of life —it is impossible that the demo-
cracy should reach its highest and best. Fill
a man’s ears and eyes and lungs with coal-
dust, and he must inevitably think and act
to some extent in keeping with the ceaseless
irritation. Put a man in an atmosphere of
unpleasant smells and hideous sights, as we
do with those who slaughter our daily beef
and mutton, and in the course of years the
thing must get into his soul and discolor
all his thought. There is no getting away
from the fact that the ideal of an educated,
thoughtful, sympathetic democracy is practi-
cally impossible while coal remains black
and occupations which were once the duties
of degraded slaves must be performed by per-
sons with full franchise and standing on
civic equality with their employers. Demo-
cracy is hideously wrong when it regards
the ballot-box as the be-all and end-all of
things. An electric current, properly ap-
plied, may have more national uplift than
all the political organisations and convinc-
ing propagandist speeches and printed works
on world-reform. To get coal nominally
white by a process of better conditions for
workers and higher wages is at best only a
temporary expedient. Coal is black and will
remain black whatever theoretical color the
Unions like to paint it.
The Army Remount.
“Aneb” : The Defence Department talks of
raising the standard of the Australian army
remount, and to that end has linked arms
with various agricultural societies and race
clubs which provide rich prizes for the
fastest mokes. It doesn’t matter if the win-
ners be broken-winded or spavin-hocked—•
the money goes to the fastest. On Cup Day
we saw a mean, undersized, curby-hocked
gelding make every other competitor look
like animated rubbish in the big handicap.
Our agricultural societies are just about as
useful. One sees a prize-winning “heavy-
weight hack” collar the cash and ribbon
among “ladies’ backs” two minutes later —
and nobody seems to spot the joke. These
societies consider the cavalry charger and*
artillery wheeler one and the same thing. I
have been asked to judge classes for Indian
remounts which the catalogue said “must
be over 16 hands.” And the Indian Gov-
ernment won’t buy a remount over 16
hands! If the Defence Department will
only state what it wants and is prepared
to pay, and employ reputable and experienced
buyers, breeders will accommodate them if
it’s made worth their while. There is no
coherence in the Departmental buying at
present. I have seen two members of a
Purchase Board inspect a mob and do a deal,
and a short time after —not long enough
for prices or mokes to improve appreciably
—another two members have inspected the
remains of the same mob and paid more
money for the previous buyers’ rejects. In-
cidentally if the Department can popularise
the breeding and use of mules it will do the
country a vast amount of good. This would
utilise thousands of unsound mares. (Ill-
shaped and unsound mares do not transmit
their beauty spots when bred to a donkey.)
But, one minute! We must educate Bill-
Jiat to the use of them at the same time.
I once told an Australian employee in
Africa to saddle a mule and come along.
“Not me!” he growled. “Do you take me
for a white Kaffir or a ruddy g'aucho?” But
I doubt whether we can reasonably expect
anything from the Defence Department as
at present run. A couple of weeks ago what
the Argus called “an important conference”
was held in Melbourne to consider raising
the general standard of the Australian horse,
having special regard to remounts. The
chairman was Brigadier-General Stanley,
who admittedly knows nothing of the sub-
ject. And the entire personnel of the con-
ference was almost as ridiculous.
The Adelaide Advertiser gave a general
support to the State Government’s amuse-
ment tax as an emergency measure; and the
amusement managers have replied by unani-
mously withdrawing their advts. Naturally
the Advertiser feels hurt. But the public
has a right to feel hurt, too. For this is not
an attack merely upon Langdon Bony-
ti-ion’s pocket. It is an obvious attempt to
make the press say what the advertiser
wants it to say, to advocate what he wants
it to advocate, and to deceive the public by
representing somebody else’s perverted judg-
ment as the paper’s own unbiased view on
a matter of public policy. In the opinion of
the amusement managers of Adelaide a
newspaper, so far from being an honest
guide to the public, ought to be a prostitute:
and if it refuses to be a prostitute, then in
their judgment it ought to be punished.
Whether men who hold such immoral
opinions are fit persons to have charge of the
entertainment of the public is a matter which
that public might very properly consider.
Prima facie they are not.
Interesting yarn from the Department of
External Affairs: —
You will recollect that some months since I was
in communication with you in regard to an article
which had appeared in The Bulletin of the 17th
February last relating to an advertisement which
had recently appeared in American papers regarding:
alleged vacancies for service with a company-
described as the “Wallaroo Moonta and Northern
Railway Company of Australia.” The article sug-
gested that as there was no such company iif Aus-
tralia the whole thing was a German plot designed
to put a stop to recruiting in Australia.
The matter was taken up by this Department, and
the British Ambassador at Washington was asked
to assist in ascertaining the identity of the persons
responsible for the advertisement and take any
action that might be possible with a view of pre-
venting any further prejudicial action of this kind
against the Empire.
The result of the inquiries shows that the man
at the back of the movement was one calling himself
Middaugh, an American who had been employed on
railway construction work in Mexico and Brazil,
and who has several times visited Europe. Middaugh
stated that he represented the firm of Norton
Griffiths, of London, and professed to be desirous
of taking with him to Australia as many as pos-
sible of the men who had worked under him before
in Brazil and Mexico. He seemed to be a man of
the world and gave the impression of being a
responsible individual. One of the persons employed
and defrauded by Middaugh made a statement to
the effect that his experience was practically the
same as that of numerous others who were engaged
by Middaugh. Several of them actually came from
distant States to Chicago in order to fulfil their
engagement. A strange feature of Middaugii’s pro-
ceedings is that in some cases he took deposits from
acquaintances whom he had known before, and in
others he refused deposits from total strangers.
Middaugh had absconded and was still at large;
it is said that he made between three and four
thousand dollars out of the fraud.
While working on his fraudulent scheme Middaugh.
occupied desk room in a respectable office in Chicago.
He seemed to court inquiry and actually called al
the British Consulate on one occasion to show what
purported to be a telegram from Norton Griffiths,
entrusting him with the work. He stated that he
did this as he had heard that quite a number of
applicants were approaching the Consulate with a
view of obtaining information in regard to the
railway. On several occasions the Consul was
approached for information, but he always dis-
claimed all knowledge of the movement.
The Consul states that it is not generally the
view that Middaugh’s movement was in any way
connected with German activities in America, and
that it is almost universally attributed to a deli-
berate intent to raise money by fraud. The
Ambassador shares this opinion.
But that was only part of the story which
The Bulletin told on February 17.
Whether Middaugh was a fraud or not
GernAan agents in America saw their oppor-
tunity, and sent large numbers of copies of
the advt. into Australia along with this
circular
The contracts entered into at the agents’ office in
Chicago are for a period of two years certain, with
an extension to five years. So when the heroes return
from the trenches at the end of the war they will
have the doubtful pleasure of walking the streets
looking for work, their families starving, during
which time the American blackleg will have a good
position and have been able to ship home a goodly
portion of the wages he has received during the
time the Australian workman has been giving his
time and risking his life for the defence of the
Empire.
A money-making rogue -wouldn’t have sent
thht kind of circular to Australia. No! —if
German agents didn’t hatch the fraud they
promptly made use of it.

“Globe” : When the Navy Wireless Depart-
ment has a few minutes to spare, it might
ask itself why Billjim, returning to Aus-
tralia on a hospital ship, should be charged
lid. per word for his winged message home.
The usual rate on Australian- and M.L.-
registered ships is 6d. per word. To charge
poor old Bill nearly double seems too much
like penalising him for fighting for his coun-
try. Bill’s lid. is cut up this way. The
Private Enterprise which owns the ship-
wireless installation grabs 4d. f that being
the maximum allowed by law. The Com-
monwealth coast station pockets 6d., which
is twice as much as would be required from
Bill as a private citizen fighting nobody’s
battles and voting “No.” Finally, the
Postal Department, which delivers the mes-
sage, demands a penny a word for the job.
It is scandalously unfair and I feel like a
bushranger every time I have to explain the
outrage. I’m a hospital ship’s operator.
An American hits back: —
George Meudell’s account of the use of electricity
generated by water-power in the United States, and
the contemporary lack of it in Australia, is sugges-
tive. But there is a vital difference between the two
countries. The U.S.A., whatever their faults, believe
in people and work and the development and utilisa-
tion of everything that tends to make men pros-
perous and productive. Judged by its actions Aus-
tralia believes in keeping a large, rich continent
almost empty and a large percentage of the inhabi-
tants doing nothing. There isn’t as much water-
power in Australia as in some countries, but in pro-
portion to population there is a good deal. To the
average American a huge country with practically
nobody in it and that didn’t want any more, and
whose motto was “Give me a spell,” would seem
the maddest concern under Heaven. .But, then, the
Yankee mind is a warped article with a pathetic
belief that man’s first duty in the world
is to do something and improve something
and wrestle with something. If he had
arrived, many years ago, at the conclusion that a
million people were enough for his country, that a
policy of borrowing and importing was best for it
and that any industry except pawnbroking was un-
important, comparisons between the two countries
might be allowable. Unfortunately, Uncle Sam’s
adherence to the policy of work instead of shirk has
made comparison not Only odoriferous but posi-
tively useless. Wilson may be “too proud to
fight”; but, anyhow, Wilson’s countrymen are not
too proud to toil.

Francis Joseph of Austria died November 21.
The grey king flutters out. The world goes

The stricken legions stagger, drunk with

Scarce knowing that a inighty chief is gone,
They face the front of battle loud and vain.
Hunger with bitter grip holds town and vale.
Kings pass. But woe it is that bread should
fail.
He made this war. A catspaw in the hand
Of mightier plotters, on the fatal gong
His withered fist smote out across the land
The jarring clamor of a brazen song ;
And flinging down the gage to force and fate
He coughed and trembled his thin hymn of
hate.
The world that rioted in turn and change
Had borne him on upon its mounting wave,
An ancient emblem in a setting strange.
A luckless thing that tottered to a grave.
He made the war. Hunger, defeat and
shame

tramway, and later on leased it for
£lB5O a year. A while ago the lease
expired, and then it was ascertained that
the lessee had made a profit of £5400 the
previous year. That was no good to the
council, which decided to let Sosh have a go.
It started, and in its first three months
managed to show a working profit of only
£931 after borrowing £2500 to spend on new
fixings. Now Sosh is faced with new
demands, and it doesn’t look as though even
£9OO a quarter will be made in future. Per-
haps it shouldn’t be made, either, for the
purpose of Sosh isn’t to make profits. Its
objects are (1) to give a better and cheaper
service, and (2) to pay decent wages, thus
cutting up Private Enterprise’s profits
between the public and the employees. But
mostly at present the public doesn’t get a
look-in. Its interest in Socialism seems to
have been entii’ely overlooked.

What is happening in Roumania is put for-
ward as proof of the German’s despair. As
he had been getting such a doing at various
places it is represented that he came to the
conclusion that the only way to save his
vanishing reserves was to throw them all at
Roumania and achieve a victory. This may
be right enough, but there seem to be one
or two holes in the yarn. For instance, it is
not beyond the region of possibility that the
German thought he was strong enough not
only to hold on to what he had before, but
also to grab some more; and he certainly
has gone a considerable distance towards
getting what he was after. If this means
that he is despairing of himself, the less he
does of it the better for us. Meanwhile all
the things that were going to occur when
Roumania butted in have been postponed,
and a fresh set of circumstances have com-
menced to develop with great rapidity. How
much nearer this brings the end The
Bulletin will not try to guess; but it seems
a reasonably fair thing to suspect (1)
that peace is not yet on the horizon, (2)
that winning the war still involves a tremen-
dous amount of hard work, and (3) that
Germany is going to win if its armies are
more effectively reinforced and employed
than ours, and if it has the greatest measure
of sustained and organised national service
behind its armies. It may be just as well
to stop there, and let the last-mentioned fact
soak in for a week.
+
There is to be another announcement this
week as to Australia’s “policy” with regard
to the reinforcing of the army. The appoint-
ment of a Director-General'of Recruiting is
spoken of, and there is to be more canvass-
ing and all the rest of it. The net result will
be an appearance of mild activity, an in-
crease of officials, the writing of vast num-
bers of reports—and the capture of an occa-
sional Billjim. The absurd; performance
in connection with the “call-up” ; the exemp-
tion tribunals; the gaolings, censorings and
strikes; the pathetic,.spectacle presented by
the Federal and State Parliaments; the
wicked stories told about the progress of the
war and the condition of the enemy, while
the truth was shamefully suppressed—all
these incidents have created throughout Aus-
tralia an atmosphere far more unfavorable
to recruiting than prevailed originally. There
is no reason why we should go on fooling
ourselves any more or putting up an elabo-
rate sham. For this and other reasons The
Bulletin suggests that a proclamation or
post-card or something should be issued
calling upon every person willing to go to tbe
assistance of Billjim to deliver himself at
some specified address on or before February
1. Whereupon he should be taken into camp,
and with the numerous other persons who
are in khaki —including a few who have been
in khaki from near the beginning—sent for-
ward to the place where they are wanted.
The whole blessed thing could be washed up
within six weeks, and instead of wasting
time on what threatens to develop into a
mockery the Commonwealth could say:
“There, that’s the end ! We can do no more
that is worth bothering about” —which
would be honest and true, even if it
sounded rotten. Then the Australian people
would no longer be burdened with Parlia-
merits making use of the war as a cover for
shirking, and could apply themselves to the
consideration of the tremendous problems
the war has created and is still creating.
There is much to be gained by this. There is
a lot to be lost by neglecting it in order to
spend a long time finding out what everyone
knows already.

“The Orchid,” revived at Melbourne
Majesty’s last Saturday, is a little more than
12 years old in Australia, and it wears fairly
well. The Bulletin of “The Orchid’s” first
period remarked upon its color, movement,
catchy melody and George Lauri. One
mourns the loss of Lauri and his full round
voice every time Phil Smith appears as
Meakin, the unique gardener in a bright
green apron, red hair and crushed straw-
berry countenance, who rears the bulb
whereby Bantock, the British Minister of
Commerce, wins a wager from an incredible
little Frenchman. But one misses more than
Lauri. There is a prevailing lack of voice in
the present company. For instance, Evelyn
Scott, Celia. Ghiloni, Connie Milne, W. S.
Percy and Fred Leslie of yore were a dis-
tinctly louder lot of principals than Minnie
Love, Addie Lennard, Nellie Payne, Clyde
Cook and Charles Albert, though the old lot
were not as well placed in every case as their
successors. The ditty of “Little Mary” as
Minnie Love sings it sounds all the better
for a mild and gentle rendering. And then
there is Ethel Cadman, tame and tuneful, in
the part where Florence Young used to be a
perturbed bride, fated to trip to Nice with
the wrong bridegroom. Florence is now an
amorous Caroline, wooed by Meakin by false
pretences and licensed to utter the broadest
remarks in the show. The character in which
tall Clara Clifton was quite at home comes
new and"strange to Miss Young, and it is
hard to accept her as a lovesick, brainless
spinster, seeking the original of a fraudulent
photo, and quite prepared to buy the best
imitation she can get. Nevertheless her vital-
ity and volume of voice are welcome in any
part. Her exclamation. “Naughty!” is a
prodigious hit. Leslie Holland is a success
as the goose-stepping dude, and Reg Roberts

is a rough-cut young medical practitioner
who suggests a cross between a herbalist and
a vet. Viewing Roberts and Miss Cadman
in this production, where they are equally
unsatisfactory in their very different styles,
it is soothing to remember how admirable
they were in “Ma Mie Rosette.” Chorus and
fixings are much the same old features of the
show.
A week’s revival of “Twelfth Night.” at
Melbourne Princess’s, will please everybody
who goes to see it in a Shakspearian spirit,
or is merely out for a laugh. The Malvolio
of Allan Wilkie and the Viola of Miss

tions, which, coming immediately after their
Hamlet and Ophelia, stamp them as

At the Sydney Society of Artists show .
The job of an artist is art, and it is a common-
place of art history that wars have reacted hardly
at all upon their contemporary painters. The
absence of war subjects from the Society of Artists’
show at the Queen Victoria Markets was therefore to
be expected, given a competent jury. The main
characteristic of the show is the commendable absence
of the “big” picture. The sole large one, an
“Evening Symphony” by Elliott Gruner, happens
to be the worst of this artist’s panel. It is depress-
ingly big.
The features of the show are Norman Lindsay s

audacious plunge into water-colors, Hardy Wilson’s
architectural pencil drawings and his panel of
water-colors, Elliott Gruner’s brilliant analysis of
the difficult problem of light, the high quality of
the etchings of John Shirlow, J. B. Godson, Lionel
Lindsay and Sydney Ure Smith, and Norman Lind-
say’s masterpiece in pen-and-ink. The last,
“Apotheosis of Francois Villon,” shows Lindsay’s
hand and his constructive artistic vision at their
highest. “The Law Courts,” by Shirlow, “Old
Bridge,” by J. B. Godson, “Governor Bourke Hotel”
and “The Terrace, Admiralty House,” by Lionel
Lindsay, and “Argvle Cut” and “No. 15, Jamieson-
street,” by Sydney Ure Smith, are the best of a
brilliant etching exhibit. The illustration by George
W. Lambert is obviously far below this artist’s
level.
Howard Ashton exhibits a glowing panel of
brilliant realism in oils, the finest being “Summer
Morning,” and he also essays pastel with apparent
ease. But his direct painting does not attempt to
solve the problem of light to which Gruner bravely
applies himself. Half a dozen of this artist’s paint-
ings of light are permanent achievements. Evidently
Gruner is but entering upon his path. Florence
Rodway’s pastels of children have all their well-
known charm; but from the joy of setting
down • with absolute faithfulness the faces of
children she has turned in one picture to the
problem of the backgrounds. “The New Tea-
pot” is a picture full of atmosphere, not a
sketch. Her large pastel is a failure. George
Dancey shows some unattractive but correct designs.
In the water-colors, John D. Moore exhibits interest-
ing work, and Alfred T. Clint has various so-so
landscapes and a muddy fan. One delightful land-
scape, charmingly composed, represents the best of
B. E. Minns’s small exhibit. Julian Ashton offers
some delicate atmospheric effects. Blamire Young’s
unique enamelled effects are seen in a small collec-
tion. Albert Collis has one delightful impression,
“Morning Light.”
In Norman Lindsay’s dash into water-color he
puts into this medium all the brilliance of his pen-
work ; he tackles problems of atmosphere and com-
position with a zest that carries him through, and
by his own unorthodox methods he gives to his
work an astonishing depth and richness of color.
These pictures of nymphs and nudes challenge every
other picture in the room. But so far his handling
of shadows on flesh is sometimes aggressively hard.
Hardy Wilson’s “The Deserted Home” is a delight-
ful composition. His “Souvenir of Corot’s Concert
Room” is masterly, though one misses any in-
dication of a wall to Corot’s concert room.
But his pencil studies of Georgian architecture in
Australia, which he has delightfully peopled W 1 .
characters in the costumes of that age, stand apar
as an achievement in a most difficult medium.
The merit of Gruner’s work has been acknowledger
by the trustees of the Wynne Art Prize, who have
awarded it to the artist for one of his most
difficult and successful studies, “Morning L>g ■
This is the first time the prize has been won by a

On Sydney screens this week: —

the story of the taming of a bandit; and “Man-
hattan Madness,” a Triangle comedy-drama of the

“The Sign of the Cross,” at Melbourne
Royal, is again presenting Julius Knight in
the trappings of Nero’s favorite lion. But
Julius is not the Superbus that Melbourne
first saw over 20 years ago. The figure that
broke a thousand hearts is beginning to show
the generosity of luxuriant middle-age. Like-
wise the voice that was beguilement to
Berenice’s wicked ear now lacks the ring of
heartfelt youthful passion. Nevertheless,
Knight is still a Y’ery passable Marcus, and
with the help of pink limelight and classic
garments almost looks the part of a fetching
canoodler when he strives to add the Chris-
tian Mercia to his menu of pagan dainties.
Lizette Parkes’s demeanor as Mercia is an
acceptable mixture of somnambulism and
spiritual exaltation. She is only shaken out
of her attitude of dazed piety by the gaudy
attentions of Glabrio and Superbus and the
insults of the latter’s supper party. And
hereabouts she shows the sign of the cross, so
to speak, rather than the pain of a saint
suffering for the sins of her tormentors.
Jean Robertson, as Berenice, is important in
diction but less striking in deportment;
whereas Eileen Sparks, as the light-hearted
Dacia, conducts herself capitally, and tips
every word with frivolity. Millie Langley
is a well-nourished Stephanus, while the
jealousy of Ancaria is delivered like a verbal
proclamation by Francee Anderson. Elsie
Bellew is mostly purple and purposeless as
Nero’s faded missus, Poppea. The Glabrio
of Eardley Turner has the customary head
of wine, and the legs and language of the
actor furnish the usual corroborative evi-
dence. James Hughes provides a familiar
colored supplement picture of Nero, Hugh
Huntley is gracefully trivial as Philodemus,
Boyd Irwin robs Tigillinus of any character
the role possesses, and Atholwood is artisti-
cally asphyxiated in the small part of Ser-
villius. The hymn-tunes of the faithful con-
tinue to make midnight mournful on the
banks of the Tiber, and an introduced
feature is the brunette pug., Starlight,
wrapped in a tiger-skin and much Sambo
dignity as Berenice’s chair-bearer and gener-
ally useful. Next Saturday “Damaged
Goods” will venture a few remarks on the
syphilis problem.

Besides providing a flicker of mirth in the
concerted work with their serious colleagues,
the three had spasms of frivolity in separate
items, whilst Brennan and Campbell united
with tenor Agnew in a small bit of female
impersonation. This last-mentioned specialty,
however, was not a success. Indeed, almost
anything on the bill was to be preferred to
the trio’s mild efforts to gag as one man and
be funny in unison. One of the considerable
features of the evening was the profound,
artesian bass revealed bv Ford Waltham in
a song as deep as the bog that William
Morris Hughes has either fallen or been
manoeuvred into.

“Mr. 44” and “The Broken Law” were
unreeled at Hoyt’s Melbourne Theatres last
Saturday. “Mr. 44,” a Metro production,
discloses the mutual magnetism of Harold
Lockwood and Beverly Bane in four or five
reels of comedy-drama. The feature of the
film is some lake scenery which is too lovely
to serve as a background for hugger-mugger
mechanics like Harold and Beverly. “The
Broken Law,” showing William Farnum and
Dorothy Bernard in the leading rOles, is
a mixture of “Komany Rye,” “Lavengro”
and the producer’s imagination—a fairly-
attractive Fox film, blessed with very good
photography.
The Takinesses, billed as eccentric duet-
tists, are givipg a joint song and zither re-
cital at Melbourne Tivoli this week. The
turn, which comes from South Africa, has
nothing in it but the remarkable vocal manner-
isms of Mr. Takiness, who sounds like a pro-
test in Flemish when he doesn’t more re-
semble an attack of croup. Jamie Kelly, the
alleged “tunnel foreman” from Amurka, will
have to rely on the aroma of his old trade
to give him any individuality. As a mere
singer and raconteur he is unarresting. In
other sectors of the entertainment the
Parshleys are inflicting chastisement on
Liszt’s Rhapsody (No. 2). Togo, the Jap,
makes a thrilling slide for life, and conjurer
Merlin maintains the uneven splutter of his
conversation.

Wirths’ Circus, having been stuck up in
Melbourne by the strike, seems to have pro-
fited by the delay. Public opinion counts for
more than posters when a circus has been
going some weeks on the same site, and
Wirths’ show, lately reinforced by Bailey’s
posing dogs, is well talked about.
All Adelaide theatrical houses continue to
boycott the Advertiser for the stand it took
on the new amusement tax. The advts. of
two city and one suburban shows continue to
appear in it, but all three print solemn
declarations in the other papers that they

PALACE.

cap for being fooled by the villain.
have neither authorised nor paid for the
same. Also they, with nearly a dozen others,
issue proclamations that for ' the genuine
article one should go to the Register or
Herald. The boycotted paper has had a
dignified leader, pointing out that advertisers
cannot be allowed to dictate the line to be
followed by a newspaper on a matter of
public policy. Its one error, made at the
beginning of the trouble, was in giving a
thorough slating to a Majestic programme of
quite average merit—somewhat above the
merit of similar programmes to which it
had for .months been giving warm praise. *
The William Anderson Co. is still going
strong in melodrama at Adelaide Tivoli.
George Cross and Agnes Keogh are the latest
additions to the team, and the capable Fitz-
herbert keeps on playing villains, though he
had one pleasant interlude in a comic charac-
ter-part. Another Anderson, James A.,
teacher of elocution, had the unusual experi-
ence of selling out the Queen’s Hall in
advance for his annual dramatic evening, so
mere cash was unavailing as a bribe for
admission. The Majestic has the Le Grohs,
fine acrobats and funny. Marvelle’s cockatoos
and Charley’s dogs imitate the human, and
in return Poincaire imitates animals and
birds. Miss Aird and other clever women
got into trousers and played for charity a
farce adapted from the American by herself;
and the Dandies in the open make the best
of the stormiest November on record. Mary
Pickford is at Wondergraph, Chaplin at
West’s, Tyrone Power at Empire, and a new
girl, Jose Collins, at the Royal.

The 19th “Federal” Art Exhibition in
Adelaide reflects the general feeling in that
city that a new start is necessary. If it
were held only every third year, Sydney and
Melbourne taking their turns in between,
artists might be keener, and the various gal-
leries would get a chance of seeing and
acquiring their work. In this instance,
apart from S. Aus., only Victoria is repre-
sented, and the Adelaide Art Gallery has cut
down its usual annual purchase to two
things—a crayon of a native, by Frederick
Britton, a local man, and a portrait by Miss
Cumbrae Stewart, one more of the many
clever girls-in-black which the Gallery has.
Miss Stewart’s figures are among the best
things in this show. Edward Davis exhibits
three very well-known local men on a lawn;
but the execution is not equal to the enter-
prise. Percy Leason goes to history for one
of the subjects which ought to be so frequent
and tempting, and depicts explorer Stuart
turning back, beaten by thirst. Gustave
Barnes has some striking blackfellows on a
Murray cliff, and a charming bit of subur-
ban scenery; Janies Ashton does nothing
striking, his son Will is away, Hans Heysen
is not represented, and John White has but
a few small things. Other items worth
noting are the European figure-studies of
Marie Tuck, a mistv Ford Paterson from
Gipnsland, Gwen Barringer’s gumtrees in
the Heysen manner, a batch of clever aqua-
tints by Fred Campbell, and flowers by
Miss Bosworth and others. Also Leason
has two clever little panels of Shakspeare
characters, and Miss M. Richardson breaks
new ground with paintinas that look like
illustrations for fairy-stories. It is not a
large exhibition; and the selectors might
well have made it smaller.
Coal may be black at some places but
at Newcastle they swear it is Brown.
Ex-Minister for Lands Niels Nielsen, who
has been serving N. S. Wales at £4 4s. a
day, arrived from America on Tuesday,
Nielsen has no doubt come back to make
certain that the “National” Government
wants him to co-operate in winning the war
by continuing to accept the four guineas
per diem.
Dr. Wade, who is testing the Papuan
strata, _ reports good oil at a depth of 187 ft.
There is another Wade who did some pretty
smart underground boring in N. S. Wales
lately and struck good oil, too. But he
didn’t have to go as deep as the doctor. The
oil came up and met him half-way.
Justice Higgins was right in describing as
a “malignant growth” the system of appoint-
ing “temporary” employees to the Federal
Public Service. The Public Service Commis-
sioner’s last report shows that there are
15,405 temporary and exempt employees, who
last year were paid in wages £1,054,915.
These men who have entered the service by
other than the front door, owing to the tem-
porary “temporary” nature of their jobs, in
which many of them have grown bald, are
paid at a higher rate than mere permanent
employees, who have come in by the front
door after their qualifications have been
ascertained.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“Norbell”: The front seat has its casual-
ties, too. When the Gonsalez Co. was doing
“II Trovatore” at H. M. Theatre, Brisbane,
the other night, during the banging “Anvil
Chorus” a chip of steel whizzed out into the
stalls and wounded a soldier. The missile
got him in the eye and the doctors doubt
whether he will be able to see out of it
again.
Passed out in London. Edward Sass, a
conscientious mummer whom Australia knew
in the Brough days. Sass afterwards had a
turn at management, mostly in S. Africa.
In this he was encouraged by George
Edwardes; his wife was a sister of that big
manager’s widow, the Julia Gwynne of the
original “Mikado” cast.
“8.. T.” : The skull to which Allan Wilkie
remarks “Alas, poor Yorick!” was originally
used by Charles Kean. It was brought to
this country by George Ward in 1851, and
most of the famous Hamlets we have had
here, including G. V. Brooke and Barry
Sullivan, have used it. Wilkie obtained it
from Ward while in Dunedin recently.
“R.R.R.”: “Melb” is wrong in his asser-
tion (B. 26/10/’l6) that the Finkelsteins
abandoned the Jewish drama project two
and a half years ago. As a fact the Yid-
dish play, under Finkelstein direction, is
flourishing to such an extent that Mrs. F.
is noAV in Sydney negotiating for a lease of
the Little Theatre, with a view to the pro-
duction of Jewish plays there. For the past
18 months the co. has been showing at the
suburban Carlton Hall every Saturday night.
The Finkelsteins have now been in Aus-
tralia six years. Two and a half years ago
they produced Jewish drama in the Little
Theatre and Concordia Hall (Sydney), also
in Perth, at the Princess Hall. As the
players are all professionals, it is self-evi-
dent that the venture is a financial as
well as an artistic success. The Strunin
show mentioned by “Melb” was merely a
hash-up of alleged Yiddish drama and vau-
deville turns.
Allen Doone hasn’t the time to do his own
stage-managing any longer, so he has per-
suaded Harrington Reynolds (Father Kelly,
of the “Rosary”), to leave off his soutane,
and attend to the job.
“The Cracked Te or”: F. S. Kelly, just
killed in Europe, was unlike most musicians
I have met, inasmuch as he knew little or
nothing of the art of blowing his own trum-
pet. When I first saw him, five years ago
in Sydney, he insisted upon talking, not
about himself, but about Leonard Borwick,
then on his way to Australia, and about the
wonderful music Sydney would enjoy when
Borwick arrived. And yet Kelly himself
was no dullard in interpreting Bach. Bee-
thoven or Brahms. Those who heard him
play the big G Major Concerto of Beethoven
with the Symphony Orchestra at the Town
Hall at the June concert of 1911 will agree
that he knew his job thoroughly. He was
also a composer, and had numerous piano-
forte pieces and songs to his credit. The
horrible waste of war!
“Die Mihi” : The Melbourne Presbyterian
Assembly held a long and anxious debate on
a requisition from a number of parents
whose girls attend the Presbyterian Ladies’
College, known to fame because it was the
place where M‘elba was taught how to
become a diva. The petitioners wanted the
Assembly to sack Goll, who manages the
musical department of the college. Finally
the Rev. Gray explained that Goll was not
an Austrian, but a Czech, and his Czech
forefathers had hated the Austrians for
years and years and years. So by an
overwhelming majority the petition was
refused, and Goll keeps his billet while some
good Australian musician is playing Brahms’s
rliapsodie with a pair of cutters on a barbed
wire fence at the Ancre. These dear old
patriotic Scotchbyterians!
From E. C. Davidson, director of the
“Australian National Theatre” :
Being a thoroughbred Australian, and one who
does not wait for the older world’s approval of our
art before I can accept it, I am going right on with
the work I have set myself to do, and shall not rest
until the Australian National Theatre is a firmly-
established fact. If the playwrights will stand the
fusillade of discouragement Bulletin scribes seem
determined to pour upon us, the day is not far
distant when they as well as the local charitable
institutions will materially benefit.
Well, The Bulletin is affable and hopes so.
Billy Salisbury, head mechanist at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, who passed out the other
week, was only 45. He had been iden-
tified with the Firm as far back as the
period when J. C. Williamson played “Rip
Y’an Winkle”; he was one of the kiddies in
the cast. He next figured as call-boy, and
eventually went behind under old Bridger,
the mechanist of the time. It has been ad-
mitted by all the famous actors who have
strutted hereabouts, including Wilson Bar-
rett, Margaret Anglin, H. B. Irving and
William Collier, that Salisbury’s ability
amounted to genius. The producer of “Peter
Pan” was flabbergasted when Salisbury pro-
duced a flying machine for fairies that
knocked the latest London idea kite-high.
Salisbury’s flying scheme had been devised
years before for a blue-ballet effect when
Mary Weir did the flying. Billy had long
hoped to chuck the stage and go on the land ;
but he didn’t move till Death took him.
“Theorbo”: After her Honolulu holiday
Melba returns to Australia to do some con-
cert Avork. Then she goes to England to
fulfil engagements, including a provincial
tour. She intends to reappear in opera
Avhen it is resumed. But wouldn’t it be
better for her to retire at the height of her
powers, like Macready, and not hang on, like
Albani and Irving? Money was a considera-
tion to both those. It isn’t to Melba.
“Rab Cilbup”: Isn’t it about time drama-
tists gave up the idea of starting plays by
switching on the electric-light? You all
know the scene: blue moonlight flooding into
the darkened room; general air of a coal-
strike. Enter a butler or the hostess, who
solemnly turns on the light. What is the
use of making a ceremony of pressing an
electric button? It happens regularly in the
best houses. In “Common Clay” this con-
vention is absurdly overworked. The hostess
is giving a dance upstairs, yet the hall,
reached by stairs from the ballroom, and
into which the front door opens, is kept in
total darkness during that dance. Only at
midnight does the hostess decide to risk the
expense and light up, and let the play begin.
From the U.S.A.: —•
Our old friend Andrew Higginson, who played a
brief part as a Bung at Wangaratta (Vie.), was
lately in the cast of “The Amber Princess” in
N’Yark. Cyril Keightley, who herds among the elect
of the profesh at Long Island, is getting a big salary-
in a bit of Broadway din called “Cheating Cheaters.”
Henry liolker, who is still in a flourishing physical
condition, is head man in “The Silent Witness” in
Boston. Willie Collier, whom Australia will remem-
ber with gratitude for showing it “The Dictator,” is
the rage in a N’Yark comedy, “Nothing but the
Truth.” Assisting Willie is Rapley Holmes, the
delicate creature who was the beauteous Waldron’s
foreman in the Australian production of “The Squaw
Man.” Rapley can now make a weighbridge tremble
to its foundations. He is just over 3001 b. and is
still fattening.
“De Oriel” : All performers are aware of
the immense social barriers betwen dramatic
and vaudeville artists. Willowby, the famous
tragedian, is of course a much superior per-
son to Wilkins, the warbling woodchopper,
Legges Duo, the songandance sisters, or
Winnie, the whistling waitress. Well the
melo. manager lately ordered Willowby to
purchase a better silk hat, many years of
“East Lynne” having sadly reduced the
artistic polish of Levison’s headgear. Seek-
ing an adjacent pawnshop, Willowby de-
manded to see some secondhand silk hats.
Moses produced three. “All I have left,”
he explained. “A dollar the lot.” “I only
require one,” said Willowby coldly. “I
need it for stage work.” “Well, Mister,”
the Jew exclaimed impatiently, “surely to
God you can juggle three.”
“0.K.”: Australia saw a replica of the
original Mrs. Dion Boucicault in her pretty
little daughter Nina, who came here with
her father and stayed with her brother as a
member of the first B. and B. Co. Nina
remains neat and pretty in her middle-age.
She has the matron part in “The Old
Country” at Wyndham’s Theatre. The
author of the play is her nephew, Com-
mander Dion Clayton Calthrop, of the
British Navy. Calthrop, by the way, is a
nephew of the well-known painter. His
father, who dropped the Calthorp and be-
came John Clayton for stage purposes, mar-
ried old Boucicault’s eldest daughter.

TO PUT ON FLESH AND INCREASE
WEIGHT.
A SPECIALIST’S ADVICE.
Most thin people eat from four to six
pounds of good, solid, fat-making food every
day, and still do not increase in weight one
ounce, while on the other hand many of the
plump, chunky folks eat very lightly, and
keep gaining all the time. It’s all bosh to
say that this is the nature of the individual.
It isn’t Nature’s way at all. Thin folks
stay thin because their powers of assimila-
tion are defective. The just absorb enough
of the food they eat to maintain life and a
semblance of health and strength. Stuffing
won’t help them. A dozen meals a day won’t
make them gain a single “stay there” pound.
All the fat-producing elements of their food
just stay in the intestines until they pass
from the body as waste. What such people
need is something that will prepare these
fatty food elements so that their blood can
absorb them and deposit them all about the
body; something, too, that will multiply their
red blood corpuscles and increase their
blood’s carrying power. For such a condi-
tion I always prescribe the following for-
mula :— §oz. Tincture of Cardamoms Com-
pound, 8.P., 2oz. Salrado Compound, 3oz.
Elixir Simplex, and sufficient water to fill
an Boz. bottle. This formula can be filled
by any chemist, and one or two tablespoon-
fuls taken regularly 20 minutes before each
ineal will cause any thin man or woman to
put on from 2 to 3 lb. of solid healthy flesh
every week. It is also a splendid aid to the
digestion, has a fine tonic effect, and is
unequalled for people who are run down, or
for old people who are lacking in nerve
force and energy. If you are below normal
weight, suffer from indigestion, are nervous
or weak, try this prescription, and see how
rapidly you pick up.—S.C.T.— Advt.

The latest triumph of the Defence Depart-
ment is that achieved in the case of Francis
A. Bent, of the A.1.F., who, after having
enlisted at the Town Hall recruiting depot
in Melbourne, and having spent some weeks
in camp, was sentenced to three months’
imprisonment at the Richmond Court for
COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.
The first case of appendicitis.
failing to report himself under the Hughes
proclamation, now repealed. With singular
prevision of Australian Defence methods, he
had asked at the Victoria Barracks before
joining the A.I.F. whether he need also
enrol under the Hughes (home service)
proclamation, and was told that of course he
need not. After he had been served with a
summons by a constable who refused to take
it back and report that Bent was in camp,
the court case came on, and at last the
soldier thought it was high time to write
to the papers about it. “It was not reported
to Us,” was Authority’s lofty explanation,
’“that the young man had enlisted!” Hadn’t
we better turn over the whole business of
running the Australian end of this war to
the Salvation Army?
“Fax”: As the women of Sydney (or
some of them) propose to form a National
party, and as they seem to have some diffi-
culty about their Constitution, may I pro-
duce for them the Draft which in exactly
similar circumstances The Freeholder
suggested to the dames of Great Britain in
far-back 1716: —
We, the Consorts, Relicts and Spinsters of the
Isle of Great Britain, being most passionately
offended at the falsehood and perfidiousness of cer-
tain faithless men, and at the lukewarmth and in-
difference of others, have entered into a voluntary
Association for the good and safety of our Constitu-
tion. .. .We promise publickly and openly to avow
the Loyalty of our principles in every word we shall
utter, and every Patch we shall stick on. We do
further promise to annoy the Enemy with all the
Flames, Darts and Arrows with which Nature has
armed us; never to correspond with Sigh, Ogle or
Billet-doux; nor to accept the civility of any Man's
Hand who is not ready to use it in the Defence of
his Country. We are determined in so good a Cause
to endure the greatest Hardships and Severities ; and
even to wear the Manufacture of our Country, rather
than appear the friends of a foreign interest in the
richest French Brocade.
The gibe is very just. Patriotism in clothing
has been the principle which has come hard-
est to the naicest members of the Ladies’
National League in any political age.

“John Dishragge”: Woman is taking a
weird view of what she calls “war work.”
A lucky friend who can still afford to pay
£1 a week to a resident lady-help is going
to lose her treasure of years past because
there is a lift-attendant job at £2 15s. wait-
ing. Now, there are plenty of soldiers, re-
turned damaged, who could fill the lift job
and keep a wife and kids on the screw, while
there are few girls capable and willing
enough to earn that domestic £1 a week.
The young woman in this case fires off the
usual gag that she is “going to do her bit
by taking the place of a man, who can thus
go to the war.” It is time we threw that
nonsense overboard and assured her that
she is dropping the work in which she can
do the greatest service to the nation and
taking the place of a man who has come
back battered from the war.

“C.F.M.”: A fair young friend of mine
who is learning how to juggle top-notes
under Melba’s tuition, has lately been
acquiring a matronly plumpness which dis-
pleases the diva’s critical eye. “This will
never do,” she said, touching the pupil
lightly on a well-moulded shoulder. “Watch
how i keep my figure down.” Then followed
a demonstration or elucidation of her sys-
tem, which is, while lying full length on the
carpet, to revolve in all directions like the
spoke of a gigantic wheel. But it isn’t safe
to try it in your best dress,
GAME.
“Chic? Wha-at!”
“Chick be blowed! She’s buried
three roosters .”
Every dog has his day—only for some the
sun sets sooner than for others. The mana-
ger of the King Edward liome for Hounds
lately appeared in the Redfern (Sydney)
court and laid out a trophy before the pre-
siding magistrate—3s tails belonging to dogs
who would wag no more. The exhibitor
claimed half a crown per tail under a
venerable Dog and Goat Act, which pre-
scribes that small reward for any raider
who will seize and destroy any un-
registered dog and produce the tail before
a magistrate or Jaypee. He claimed
£4 7s. 6d. for the Home, remarking that “so
far as he, knew” all the victims had been
unregistered. The remains had been burnt.
The magistrate looked at the cold, still tails,
shuddered and allowed the claim. Name of
magistrate: Love!

“H.S.”: Here in Launceston (Tas.) we
have what is called a Naval Reserve, about
150 strong. In most of the towns where
there are facilities they are in proportion.
At present they are just a lot of young
landsmen who have been taught to row a
gig, and once or twice have been made
seasick for a week
on a torpedo boat.
They are the pick
of the local boys,
and about SO per
cent, of them have
volunteered for ac-
tive service; but
while one or two
have been accepted
as signallers, etc.,
the majority have
been refused permis-
sion to serve. Why
not accept them for
the term of the war,
and send them to
England to sample
active service with
the fleet? If that
were done, at the
end of the war
the Commonwealth
would have a genuine
Naval Reserve, not a number of willing land-
lubbers in a naval dress.
* * * *
Australia isn’t all picture shows and
strikes. A trepang cutter which went out
at the end of August with two Filipinos in
charge blew back to Darwin the other day
with only its crew of three black boys and
two lubras. The Filipinos, whilst working
their curing-pots with the help of friendly
blacks near the Goyder River, had been
attacked by wild abos. from another tribe.
The Filipinos made a dash for the water and
tried to swim off to the cutter; but the
hissing spears caught them and the bodies
sank. To the story the N.T. police add a
footnote that the same murderers have been
having quite a busy season . and that the
coast is only safe for armed parties. Thank
Heaven, there are still some people ready
to defend Australia!
“K.Q.”: Mudgee (N.S.W.) claims to be
the only inland town which fires a one
o’clock gun. It only happens on Saturdays
but is waited for by all hands and never
misses. The old breech-loader —of the kind
Grenville used on the little Revenge-Ms
mounted on a wooden stand about 10ft. high
and frowns on the bank of the Cudgegong
River, near the main street. The post office
receives “time” at one o’clock from Sydney,
and a boy with a red flag signals to the
municipal council’s employee, who touches
her off. Some local hard-doer fired her off
the other night in the middle of a war pic-
ture entertainment, but it didn’t stimulate
recruiting.
Wood, of the Melbourne Board of Public
Health, has been throwing out a vague sug-
gestion that he deserves a statue in the
market-place and a testimonial engrossed on
vellum. Some years ago he “directed atten-
tion” to the dangers of long skirts as germ
collectors and carriers. The women didn't
immediately shorten their skirts and petties,
but latterly they have reformed their dress
beyond his wildest dreams. Therefore he

invited the Board of Health to pass a motion
.of congratulation to local womankind on its
wise regard for the general welfare. A
brother councillor asked Wood whether he
thought that the Board’s vote of appreciation
of the latest Paris fashion would have any
effect in preventing a return to the old,
draggle-tailed, germ-collecting draperies when
the ballet-girl skirt went out of vogue. Wood
solemnly asserted that he thought it would :
but in spite of his sublime faith he was
induced to withdraw his motion.
REALITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Did we laugh too well ?
Was the world too kind
When the twilight fell
And the night was blind ?
Roses breathed around.
Stars were white above;
In the gloom we found
Little frightened love.
All the laughter died,
We had naught to say—
That we tried to hide
Caught us both at play.
Love, you trembled so—
Breast and silken sleeve.
Half an hour ago
All was make-believe.
Did we laugh too well? -
Was the dark too kind ?
Soft rose petals fell,
All the trees were blind.
Then your yielding lips
Paid love’s first hot tax —
Cabbages and chips!
Shoes and sealing-wax!

“Petifi”: When the grand uproar is over
the full company might do worse than ad-
vance to the footlights and give three cheers
for that enthusiastic front-stallite—Den-
mark. In the early days of the commotion
the military doctors were horrified at the
frequency of tetanus cases among the
wounded, and at their wits’ end to cope
with the trouble. Then enter Hamlet.
Dr. Th. Madsen, director of the Danish
Serum Institute, bought 60 horses and got
busy making the anti-toxin that gives bro-
ther Tetanus the knock-out, passing it
along, literally by the gallon, to the battle-
fronts. So far over 2,000,000 “por-
tions” have been distributed among the hos-
pitals, and Heaven only knows how many
otherwise dead soldiers have, in conse-
quence, got another chance. If ever T.
Atkins gets to know how the Danish Serum
Institute has done its little bit he’ll want to
pass round the hat that signifieth gratitude.

An Australian artist’s half-hour at the
Front:—■
I am writing this at the end of a dull, grey day
in France. My studio is a cold, allegedly shell-
proof dugout with an arched roof of iron cupolas
covered with bags of sodden clay and a crop of lank
grass. The other occupants are an A.M.C. corporal,
a sergeant-armament artificer and a tall, clear-
skinned youth from an English Flying Corps—a wire-
less telegraphist attached for the convenience of our
artillery, and a corner of the boudoir is his. We
are almost in darkness, having exhausted our candle
supply; and through the opening in the upper half
of the front-wall, where one might expect light, is
nothing but a scowling, leaden sky heralding the
close of another hilarious day.
Opposite me the young Englishman is crouched
over a rickety table bearing his portable receiving
apparatus. The aluminium what-you-may-call-it is
clamped to his ears, and he has just got on to
Eiffel Tower and is taking down the latest war-news.
This branch of the business is rather interesting,
inasmuch as messages may be picked up from Paris,
Berlin and Sausage balloons. Faint buzzing words
from London and other English stations raise vain
longings in our hearts. Finished at last, he hands
the communique to the sergeant, who reads it aloud
by the wretched dim light. But his voice is sud-
denly drowned by whang-bang! whang-bang! “That’s
the battery again commencing its evening
strafe,” remarks the corporal. “Trying to get a bit of
their own back. Seven of ’em killed by one shell
in the gun-pit last week.” With each shot the
water-sodden landscape vibrates and quakes, and con-
versation soon lags. Somehow my pipe won’t draw;
and we remain staring silently and gloomily out
into the drizzling twilight.
The first evening starshell creeps up and hovers
a moment against the murky background framed in
the dark square of our doorway. I try to find
dissipation in watching for the next one to appear,
while .the sergeant seats himself on a box and stares
moodily down on our patchwork floor. I follow
his gaze and notice one piece of board gently bob
and sway like a loose plank in the floor of a leaky
HATED TO THINK OF IT.
DAPHNE: “What is your idea of not letting
him propose?”
DOLLY: “Well, when we are engaged it will
be my sacred duty to make him
economise.”
dinghy. With a Parliamentary remark he commences
to lift and fling the uneven lengths of board to one
side. The movement causes water to ooze up through
the cracks in other places, and soon a charming lake
is revealed. With much language and a jam-tin he
proceeds to dispose of the surface waters through
the doorway, leaving the oil-drum (placed under
our floor to catch the drainage, but which has over-
flowed) to be emptied later on.
The A.M.C. man is squatting in the one dry corner
looking through some ill-treated gramophone records,
the gift of a cable-station official in Hong Kong.
By now our guns have ceased and there is only
the customary faint rumbling in the distance. The
airman and I are still sucking our pipes, staring
out into the sloppy gloom and thinking silent pro-
fanities. The only sound affecting the conscious
mind is the tssip-tssip and gurgle of everlasting
damnable waters. We listen to it in silent wretched-

ness. My feet feel damp and chilled, and I can
almost see my nose taking on a pink-and-blue frozen-
mutton hue. My mind will dwell on images of a
roaring coal fire, soft floor rugs and a nicely-set
dinner table.. Someone sniffles his nose wretchedly,
and unnecessarily observes that it is going to be a
co-o-old night. Then from the vicinity of the A.M.C.
man comes a low, harsh, grating sound and an
irritating parody of a human voice commences “A
sho-o-ort life but a ga-a-a-ay one!” This is too
much, “....the Kaiser!” someone explodes; and
the motion is carried without a referendum.

“T. 0.1.”: Some interesting applications
are on the file in Sydney for registration
under the Real Property Act. One lot is part
of the estate at Newtown granted to Gover-
nor Bligh by his predecessor, Governor
King, before the formality of “swearing
in” was gone through. When sworn in
and Governor de facto, Bligh granted
King’s wife a thousand or more acres at
South Creek, now St. Mary’s. Another
lot is part of a grant to Dr. Balmain,
who when leaving Botany Bay sold the
whole of the site of the grimy suburb to
a friend in India for 10s. This friend
was Dr. John Gilchrist, professor of
Hindustanee in Calcutta, who passed the
bargain on to an English company.
# * * *
“D.D.S.”: Even the regimental dentist’s
chair seems to have red-tape bows on it. A
young Billjim the other morning found that
the filling had come out 'of a tooth. He re-
ported to the uniformed dentist on the spot,
and was informed that he could have the
tooth pulled if he liked, but that Lieutenant
Fangs had no authority to refill it for him.
Billjim leapt out of the chair and was
making for the door, when Fangs added a
postcrint that if he (Billjim) liked to get
an order on his own dentist he could have
the filling done and keep his tooth.. But why
couldn’t the military dentist do the job?
What absurd regulation is getting in the
way of men who are employed to save grind-
ers, not to squander them? Can’t the stupid
military people see that the rule encourages
the sacrifice of teeth, just as though it were
an advantage in a soldier to be toothless?
* * * *
A story from the place where Billjim is
emulating the habits of the wombats of his
native land. On the morning following a
particularly dirty dust-up Bill bared his
shoulder and showed two or three comrades
a wound that looked just about awful enough
to stop a horse. “Name o’ !” cried
Jim, “ain’t you showed it to the doctor?”
“No,” replied Bill, “not me!” “But,
strewth! don’t it hurt?” “Oh, yes, it ’urts.
But I ain’t goin’ to pamper the
thing.”
“Q.M.S.”: “McNorth” is right (B.
26/10/T6) —-there will be plenty of Bill-
jims looking for the open spaces when this
far-flung row is finished. I had an idea that
way myself after returning from Gallipoli;
so, after consultation with Doreen, who
reckoned she was game to undertake a bit
of pioneering, I made application to Kink
O’Malley for a job, as a preliminary to get-
ting acclimatised. After a short wait of one
calendar month (which
was of no conse-
quence, of course, as
all Billjims have tons
of money), I was in-
formed that there was
a vacancy in the Ac-
counts Branch at Port
Darwin, that the
salary would be so
and so, and they would
have much pleasure
in giving the position
to a Billjim, but it
was necessary to in-
terview the Inspector
of the Commonwealth
Public Service. When
I tracked the official
down, he said he would
be pleased to recom-
mend me for the job.
However, after three
months’ negotiations,
finality was reached
by O’Malley regret-
ting sincerely that he
did not think that in
my present state of
health it would be ad-
visable for me to
undertake work in the
N.T. The joke of it
is that not a one
of them had even asked me to poke out my
tongue. But I’m poking it out now !

“McNorth”: The Outback hangman men-
tioned by “Splodger” (B. 2S/9/T6) who got
£6O a head for stringing up a couple of nig-
gers must have belonged to the union to
get such a fee. In Papua, a few years ago,
niggers convicted of murdering white men
were jerked into the hereafter by anyone
who fancied the job, and the question of
payment was seldom pressed. But if the
operator demanded it a fiver a neck was
paid. It is alleged that on one occasion
Governor MacGregor asked a hard doer
named Ole Bill to hang a couple of blacks.
“Ye’ll be paid ten pounds for the job,” said
Wee Mac. “Wull ye do it for that?” “Five
pounds each!” said Ole Bill. “’Struth, I’d
hang all the niggers in New Guinea, an’ you,
too, for a fiver a time!” He got the job ;
MacGregor liked enthusiasts. Incidentally,
in the mountainous inland country of Papua,
where, because of the difficulties of transit, a
scaffold was impracticable, it was the cus-
tom to hoist the condemned by a rope under
the armpits and over a convenient branch
of a tree. The usual rope round the neck
was placed in position and the other end
made fast to the limb. Then at the word
“Go !” the first rope was cut, and the vic-
tim dropped suddenly for a few feet, and
then remained suspended in the climate.

Again the graphic Anzac: —
We are so close to Fritz’s line that we can almost

THE SIMPLE LIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hence! Bring me not the mocking heat and pale
That glows from frail contrivances of tin!
Let others fry the chop as day grows stale
On lamps that seek a short respite to win
From the disordered purpose of the mob
Whose principles, per gross, might fetch five bob t
Coal fails to-day. To-morrow kerosene
Is scarce as nuggets of unsullied gold.
Give me the simple things these eyes have seen
Playing their humble, honest part of old.
I go to nature, clear of fraud and tricks,
And cook my daily cow on blue-gum sticks.
Civilisation crumbles to its fall.
Its halo of electric light goes out.
Its stove is black ; the darkness like a pall
Has wrapped its streets and houses round about.
Yet shall I triumph in the cave-man’s way,
And boldly front my three square meals a day.
Here, where the rosebud to the fuchsia nods
And all the air with summer’s breath is sweet,
I rear a kitchen-range of verdant sods
And stir hot embers round the poppy’s feet.
The garden looks surprised; but what care I
While merry lambkin chops are mine to fry?
I shall not chase the wilding kerosene,
Nor hunt the petrol to its smellful lair.
Joyous beneath the waving bough and green *
I rear my altar in the open air—
My kind domestic altar fair and bright
To that triumphant godlet, Appetite.
Strike one, strike all! The world may come and go
As long as I can find a match to strike
And chips of wood to make a little glow
Beneath the broiling viands that I like.
I feel elate, untrammelled, glad and free,
Picnicing in the teeth of anarchy.

PREMIER RYAN, Queensland.
W. G. Spence, who is 70, is the eldest
man in Hughes’s new team. Queenslander
Bamford, native of Dubfco (N.S.W.), now
Minister for Home Affairs, is in his 68th
summer. Archibald, the humorous Minister
for Customs, is 65 ; Treasurer Alex. Poynton,
born in Victoria, is 63; and P.M.G. Web-
ster 55. Hughes is 52, Senator Lynch 49
and Senator Pearce, another Australian
born, 44.
A. G. Pendleton, dead in Adelaide at 79,
had valuable experience in the Manchester
district and in India before arriving in
South Aus. in 1877. He took hold there
as traffic-manager, and in 1895 became Rail-
ways Commissioner, in succession to the
Board which for seven years had consisted
of an imported chairman (J. H. Smith),
with Neill and John Hill. Since then it
has been a one-man job. Pendleton had
14 years as sole Commissioner, and retired
in 1909. Like Moncrieff, his successor, and
McGuire, the present holder of the position,
he was an Irishman.
“W.J.H.”: As “Loco” says (8.2/11/T6),
time has proved that the just-dead Alison
Smith was mostly right and the Age mostly
wrong in the tremendous row over the Vic.
railways in the early ’nineties. Events
have justified the late superintendent in
every innovation of his for which he was
condemned by the Judge Casey Board of
Inquiry, and afterwards dis-
missed. His big engines have
brought blessings from weary
engine-drivers ever since. The
Board of long ago decided
against these very types. Smith
was condemned for laying down
heavy rails. Heavier rails have
been adopted everywhere since.
He was denounced for extrava-
gance in attaching the Westing-
house brake to goods trains.
Now every truck has it. He
was sentenced to Sheol for build-
ing the first decent railway-car-
riage in Victoria. Now we are
educated up to pretty fair coach-
ing-stock. As one who served
directly under Smith and par-
ticipated in his downfall, it gives
me great pleasure to testify to
the foresight and ability of the
much-misrepresented and badly-
treated engineer. He may have
made mistakes, but what experimenter
doesn’t? It is the fear of making mistakes
that makes slaves of most of us. Strange
to say, Smith’s chief antagonist, ex-Commis-
sioner K. L. Murray, has just accompanied
him past the Home signal.
Thomas Prout Webb, K.C., Commissioner
of Taxes in Vic., is dead at 71. He was
born at Newtown, now Fitzroy, in 1845, son
of Robert Saunders Webb, who in the mid-
’thirties was clerk to the Collector of Cus-
toms in Sydney—the old Customs House
still stands in Argyle Cut. Webb, sen.,
went with Robert Hoddle to Melbourne in
1837 and acted as clerk at the first land sale
(June 1, 1837), Robert Hoddle, Chief Sur-
veyor, being auctioneer. At this sale Webb
secured an allotment at Williamstown for
£4O, and at the second sale (Nov. 1) he
bought several Melbourne city blocks for a
few pounds apiece. The son was for some
years a barrister on the Equity side, and in
1884 succeeded Frederick Wilkinson as
Master in Equity and so passed to his recent
billet. He married a daughter of John
Thomas Smith, seven times Mayor of Mel-
bourne.
McGirr and the burly Stuart-Robertson
have worked their way to a place somewhere
near the front in the much reduced N.S.W.
Labor party. A tale is told that 11 years
back, when the P.L.L. executive was select-
ing a bunch of three to run for the Senate,
they were both competitors for a place. Cold-
tea Clark and McDougall were already
selected, and a third was being achieved by
a process of elimination. Stuart-Robertson
and McGirr remained. “Anyone know R. J.
Stuart-hyphen-liobertson of Cobar?” the
Chairman asked. The late Donald Macdonell
was present, and said he knew him well.
Then Donald asked: “Anyone know
McGirr?” and nobody did. “Then you’d
better run McGirr,” says Donald, and they
took his advice.
The vague “conscientious objectors” struck
a snag in South Aus. when they brought
their appeals before Judge John Gordon. The
wise and worldly old Judge, coming out of
a Presbyterian manse, includes in his rare
mental furnishing a thorough knowledge of
the Bible, and met them on their own
ground. The man who claimed that Christ
said “Thou shalt not kill” was asked to show
the text, and couldn’t. If he chose to stand
by the Old Testament, he was asked to
defend the law allowing two wives, or was
referred to the Lord’s command to make a
list of all the men of 20 and over “that are
able to go forth to the war.” If he elected
for the New Testament, he would be ques-
tioned as to his savings bank account, and
invited to reconcile it with the injunction
not to “take thought saying what shall we
eat or drink, or wherewithal shall we be
clothed?” It was an exhilarating and quite
unusual scene for a law court, and the per-
fectly obstinate “Turn the other cheek”
wowser was told to go into camp for a
month, do non-combatamt duties, and “pray
for the Germans —tliey need it badly
enough.”
One man who shivers in the cold coali-
tion wind in N. S. Wales is Henry Wi is,
who helped the Holman crowd out ot a
blind gully by taking the Speaker s chair
when Labor couldn’t spare a man tor tne
job. The understanding then was that he
could go to the Leg. Council if he wanted to
presently. Having lost his seat in the
Assembly, he cleared for action by becom-
ing a member of a P.L.L., it being under-
stood that the P.L.L. would raise Cain it

Rubicund' N. Johnson, N. S. Wales Com-
missioner for Stamps, and the State’s most
ardent hunter after a forgotten tuppence,
resigns on the score of ill-health at 68 years
of age. He was born in the Rocks area,
where his father had a cooperage. After a
probation in a mercantile office, young John-
son joined the Stamp Office as a junior
under William Hemming—a Sydney law
stationer before he became Stamp Commis-
sioner, and the man who introduced the
common or house sparrow to Australia.
When the then Stamp Act was repealed
young Johnson became a clerk in the Sheriff’s
Department, and as such acted as Deputy
Sheriff at a blackfellow’s execution in
Dubbo. When stamp duties were re-
imposed he returned to the office and worked
up to the Chief’s chair. He was a brother-
in-law of the late J. H. Rainford, old-time
actor. Nobody who merely knew him as an
angry bulldog worrying a citizen for a 'bit
of duty which he thought was being with-
held is likely to believe that as a young
man his hobby was the rearing of canaries.
Burnt to death in France, while attend-
ing to his gun, Sergeant William Young,
who fired Australia’s first shot in this war.
Before he joined the A.I.F, two years ago,
Young, then 22 years of age, was with the
Permanent Artillery, and was stationed
at the Point Nepean (Vic.) fort at Mel-
bourne Heads when war was declared in
August, 1914. The German cargo steamer
Pfalz made an attempt to escape. It was a
rash attempt, for worse would have been
in store for her had she cleared the Heads.
Possibly she “had a meet,” as the boys say,
with the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau,
then in Australian waters. But Young
changed her mind by firing a shell which fell
in the water close to the vessel, causing her
to return to Hobson’s Bay. Young at the
time of his death was in the Heavy How it
zer Brigade. He had been wounded in
Gallipoli, and when convalescent f & s trans-
ferred to Egypt, and afterwards to liance.
He was a St. Arnaud boy.
The Kaiser is responsible for the death of
Captain F. S. Kelly, tlie best amateur
sculler Australia has produced. He won tne
Diamond Sculls at Henley-on-Thames three
times and the Wingfield Sculls (amateui
championship of the Thames) once ; was in
the Oxford eight that was beaten m IJUo,
and helped the Leander Club to win tne
Grand Challenge Cup at Henley on three
occasions. Kelly was a member of the Royal
Naval Volunteer Reserve, and only a tew
weeks ago was awarded a D.S.O. for bravery
at Gallipoli. Among his hobbies were piavo-
playing and musical composition. Wulie-
motor Kelly and Alderman Kelly, ot Syd-
ney, have the distinction of being brotheis.
They were sons of “Tin” Kelly, who made a
pot of money out of smelting the metal the
billy is coated with.

Private Donald H. Campigli, not yet -.1,
stood up in the South Melbourne drill-hall
last week while the G.-G. pinned the Dis-
tinguished Conduct Medal on his chest. This
youth, not then 19, shared with his pals ot
the Stli Battalion the fame of the Landing
and the glory of Ilelles when McCay sooled
the 2nd Brigade onward. It was in Shrap-
nel Gully that he won his medal. From the
front of a trench from which the Australians
had driven the Turks came the cries of our
lads for water. Captain Hartland, after-
wards killed, refused Campigli’s plea to go
to his comrades’ succor. But Campigli
couldn’t stand those cries, and waiting till
Hartland’s back was turned, he went "over
the top” with a full canteen, and dragged a
wounded man into shelter. Going out again
he gave drink to an other, shot near the
spine, and then heaved him on to his own
back, though the stricken soldier’s 13st. was
a burden almost too great for the youngster.
Within 15ft. of safety the wounded man was
shot again, and yet a third time, the last
bullet being fatal. Campigli is an old boy of
the Searsdale State School.
Sergeant-Major Gregory Geake, an Aus-
tralian, has invented a bomb-thrower that
can be managed easily by one man and runs
to just three-and-six, as compared with
£2S, the cost of the fine Stokes gun —a
weapon that requires a crew of three.
Geake’s plaything is lighter than a rifle- —a
mere steel bar
that can be car-
ried in the belt
and becomes a
sort of folding
tripod. The in-
ventor has ap-
plied for heaps

his new three-

notion has so
far satisfied all
tests. It is the

Old Hiram Maxim goes out peacefully at
76, after two years of the briskest business
a gunmaker could ever hope to see. Inven-
tor of the squat, chattering terror that mows
men clown like grass, he has mountains of
dead men to his credit —and they wear all
the uniforms of the war. One battlefield
writer compared the sleeting rattle of the
busy Maxims to the sound made by a million
typewriters all furiously tapping out death-
warrants. The only time men ever turned
to a Maxim for a new lease of life was when
Colonel Younghusband was climbing with a
British force into exclusive Tibet. The
terrible cold gripped the vitals of the men,
and, as they knew rum had been poured into
the water-jacket of the Maxim to keep the
water in it from freezing, the nearest Mul-
vaney slily took out the plug and sampled it.
But 'some brute higher up who knew
Mulvaney had slily added a heavy dose of
kerosene.
THE GREEN HILL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I lie upon the grass, defiled, obscene,
Thrust out, a pariah, from the ways of men,
And leper-like I wail “Unclean! Unclean!”
And close my eyes and long to dream again!
I try to feel the pride of manhood strong
That thrilled my pulses at the clamant call,
When I stood up, or whether right or wrong,
In honor’s cause, to freely give my all.
But now, dishonored, profligate and vile,
Foul victim of libidinous desire,
A lust-stained derelict at which men smile,
A noisome thing, I languish in the mire.
At church parade they whine the hymns and pray,
And ev’ry supplication seems a sneer;
They drone “There is a green hill far away”—
Christ, my green hill, my Calvary, is here!
Here, where a flow’r-starred slope of sun-kist green
Encompassed by the crooning summer sea,
And that curved, wid’ning river’s restless sheen,
Is paradise—and my Gethsemane !
I watch the river’s busy traffic pass,
I trace the crowded troopship to the sea,
And as I groan upon the verdant grass,
The distant cheers are faintly borne to me.
Between me and that sweep of olive green,
Where mangroves fringe the river and the sea,
There winds a turbid belt of ooze unclean
That girds my green hill and imprisons me!
And from that ooze rise wretches such as I,
Merged in a slough, so near the open sea!
I watch the fairy fleets of sails go by,
And know that none may help—God pity me!
And, lest revolting at my shameful plight,
I would be free, stern sentries stand alway,
Their watch-fires glow throughout the weary night,
Their shining arms gleam through the garish day.
By day I hear the bush-bird call his mate,
At night, the curlew’s wild, despairing cry,—
Dear Christ! for lepers still compassionate,
Help me to save myself, help me to die!

No Australian co. working in competition
with foreign concerns has made better pro-
gress in 10 years. Down to the opening
years of this century the co., which was
originally a small offshoot from Burns
Philp’s, was satisfied to pay either small divi-
dends or no dividend at all. Down to 1899
inclusive nothing more than 6 p.c. was paid,
and mostly less; and the co. was then 14
years old. and, moreover, had had the back-
ing of the prosperous Burns-Pliilp Co. into
the bargain.
If an insurance concern can get through
the teething period, nothing holds out a
much brighter promise. The Queensland
not only got through that period but found
itself then blessed with a vigorous manage-
ment which was prepared to cry at the
top of its voice that it was Australian and
entitled to Australian support on that
account, other things being equal. Aus-
tralia was only waiting to be appealed to
in that way: and the next table shows some
of the results :

In 10 years the business has trebled and
in six years it has doubled. And it has been
on the whole such profitable business that
in 10 years no less than £369,000 has been
saved to Australia compared with what
would have been the result had the business
gone to foreign cos., as it mostly used to.
Of that £369,000 no less than £175,000 has
been permanently retained in the business,
being transferred to capital; and, in all,
another £109,000 has been added to re-
serves. Approximately only one-third of
the profit has been divided among share-
holders ; the other two-thirds has been left
in the business so that policy-holders may
sleep more soundly in their, beds. Last
year, apparently recognising that a co. was
liable to be indirectly penalised for its early
providence, something extra in the way of
capitalising reserves was done. The capital
was taken from £150,000 to £250,000 in
one lift. And though p.c. is now paid
upon the whole lot, very little more than
half the profit is thus consumed. But the
co. can hardly expect to do as well nor-
mally. In spite of Wilhelm and his ally
the 1.W.W., the loss rate was under the
average of recent years. Which seems to
mean that, where there were extra risks,
the extra rates more than covered them.
Qwing to the rapid increase of business
the co. for some years did not show up very
well in the matter of reserves against risks.
But, owing to the policy of the co. in hang-
ing on to .so large a proportion of its profits,
the position to-day is quite satisfactory.
Capital and reserves combined total
£421.980. This is 173 p.c. of last year’s
net premiums, which is rather better than
the average of the best English cos. In
cash and well-written-down Government
securities alone, after paying all liabilities,
the co. had on September 30 enough to pav
nearly three years’ normal claims. Given
an average expense rate this year and a
premium income equal to last year’s, then
during the current year it could pay with
its cash and public securities alone losses
four times greater than those of any year
in the co.’s history. Nobody can reasonably
want anything better than that.

The deficit is represented as usual by a
“Foundation, organisation and extension of
business ' account. No doubt it is argued
that the policies which have been got are
worth money—that if the co. left off hunt-
ing for new business and simply wound-up
what. it. has it would make a very fair profit
out of it, enough to at least wipe out some
°/ .the deficit shown above. But unfortunately
£25,092 isn’t the full amount of the deficit,
because every policy in force represents a
liability which is not shown as such in the
balance-sheet. So far, in other words, we
have the income on one side and the actual
outgoings on the other; and the actual
outgoings are £25,092 in excess of the income.
But in addition to the actual outgoings a
certain amount ought to have been put by
towards paying the policies when they
become claims. What that amount is it is
impossible to say, but an actuarial valuation
is now in progress, and the conclusions are
expected by the end of the year. Only small
concerns like the A.M.P. and M.L.C. can
manage to get out their actuarial reports
simultaneously with their accounts.
The outgoings in excess of the income have
been paid out of share capital, of which there
is still £31,802 intact, represented by: Cash
on deposit, £16,121; loans on mortgage,
£13,818; and sundries. So, even though the
actuary will report that there is a liability
of some thousands in connection with the
policies in force, the policyholders are well
protected ; and it will be noticed by the first
table that the total outgoings have now been
brought down to less than the income. It
doesn’t follow that the office, though in its
sixth year, is yet living within its means,
because £l4l6—the so-called surplus of the
year—is not likely to be as much as the co.
ought to put by in twelve months towards
meeting its policy liabilities. Still the move-
ment is in the right direction ; and the pre-
sent figures, taking all circumstances into
account, are reassuring.
The co. issues house-purchase policies, both
Ordinary and Industrial. So far the actual
advances have been small. Since commenc-
ing business 70 advances have been made, 30
of which have been wholly repaid. Only
three advances were made last year, and the
total outstanding at Sept. 30 was £13,818.
The management doesn’t tell us the amount
for which the co. is liable to be asked ; and
that might be valuable information. Last
year, for instance, though only the three
new advances were made, first premiums were
paid on 25 new policies.

War profits, of course ; and no special pro-
vision seems to be made for war taxes. Some-
thing substantial may therefore have to
come off the figures later on. Nevertheless
one thing ought to be remembered to the
advantage of this co. in connection with
any scheme for collecting war taxes. If
the War Department wanted bricks des-
perately and a working brickmaker, in
order to supply them, toiled 15 hours a day
for a while, nobody would be so unfair as
to say that he should draw no more money
than if he had worked only eight hours and
produced little more than half as many
bricks. But in connection with the earn-
ings of a business the theory generally put
forward is that profits in excess of the
average made in the pre-war period should
be more or less commandeered, no matter
how they have been made; so that the
merchant who has made his war profit by
charging four times more for his stocks, or
the shipowner who charges 40 times higher
freight, would be on exactly the same foot-
ing as a manufacturer who made his war
profit by making four huiidred times more
goods. Actually he may sell the individual
article for much less than he formerly did ;
for the high cost of Australian and M.L.
manufactured goods has been mostly due to
the small output. It seems a fair thing,
then, that in fixing the amount of war tax
to be paid regard should be had to the
means by which the war profit has been
made.
The co., managed with Caledonian cau-
tion, has not been addicted to paying away
more than it has earned; wherefore, though
its dividend was as little as 2$ p.c. 10
years ago, it has put by enough to make
its position fine and strong. Take a 10-year
comparison:—-
1906. 1916.
Liabilities .. .. ..£15,004 £12,812
Plant and fixed property . . 70,960 61,434
Goods .. .. . . 37,462 50,697
Book debts and sundries . . 9,27 S 21,813
On the surface plant and fixed property
are of less value than they were 10 years
ago; in other respects the position has im-
proved by £27,962. Whether the plant,
etc., really is worth less now than it was
in 1906 this paper doesn’t know. It only
knows that as much as £17,895 was spent
on new plant, etc., in the three years
1913-4-5; and that alone would counter-
balance a good deal of depreciation.

The drought of 18 months ago affected the
past year’s commission earnings in prac-
tically all departments; but, as the directors
put it, “the decrease in the production of
wool and the total cessation of our cus-
tomary large export trade in frozen meat
have to a large extent been compensated for
by the abnormal prices ruling throughout
the year for wool, produce and stock.” On
the other hand, there have been large in-
creases in taxation, with higher wages
under awards of Arbitration Courts and
Boards. High prices for live stock seem
certain for many years to come; but the
future of wool is less certain, and this is
the department in which Harrison Jones
are particularly interested. As a partial
set-off wage-costs may improve. It is im-
probable that there will be any serious reduc-
tion in wage rates. But that is of little
consequence. Wage rates are not the factor
of importance. Wage costs are. And already
there is in some directions a marked ad-
vance in labor efficiency with a correspond-
ing reduction in costs. In the building
trade in Sydney, for instance, since the
State Government discovered that the pawn-
shop is a cold place the private builder has
found that labor efficiency is from 20 to 334
p.c. higher than it was at the height of the
recent building boom. This is going to be
a pretty general experience before very
long.
The co. has done better, no doubt, than
its figures show over a long range of years,
because as the result of loans made in the
late ’Bo’s.and early ’9o’s it acquired many
assets which had to be quietly written down.
Even so. however, the visible progress has
been good enough :

Meantime without getting in any fresh capi-
tal it has added about £20,000 to its free-
holds, put £10.486 into a leasehold and has

ing that the advances are sound, share-

This CO. has practically only two assets—
(l) 'Shares and interests in jam manufac-
turing and fruit cos. and timber mills in
the _ Commonwealth of Australia, South
Africa and England,” £674,764, and ad-
vances to these cos., £25,750; (2) Common-
wealth war loan, £15,000. The co. began
wuth Henry .Tones and Co., who ran the
lAL jam-factory at Hobart. Henry .Tones
and his partner Ach. Palfreyman saw that
there was serious waste, not only in manu-
facture but in selling, which was to the
disadvantage alike of the producer of the
raw material, the manufacturer and the
public. This co. was formed to. organise the
business. It purchased all or most of the
shares in various manufacturing cos. in.
Tasmania, Victoria and N-. S. Wales; and
later on the business was extended to
Queensland and S’Africa, where other cos.
were formed.
The accounts of these subsidiary cos. are
not published; and the solitary item on the
revenue side of the P. and L. account of
this co. is “Income earned from investments
in the Commonwealth of Australia.” For
the past year this was £68,096; and, includ-
ing Federal taxes (£2193), the entire out-
goings were £2945. “Very satisfactory
results,” the directors say, “have been ob-
tained from the S’African factory”; but
“the profits are again being retained in that
country to meet the continued expansion of
trade there.” Exactly the same thing may
be happening in connection with the Aus-
tralian cos. They may be dividing only
three-fourths of their profits and using the
other fourth in extending their business. On
the other hand, certainly, they may be divid-
ing so much that they may not be laying
by sufficient for replacement of plant, etc.
It doesn’t, however, look the sort of Board
which would sanction that policy. In the
same way, while the P. and L. account gives
very little real information about the co.’s
business, or the businesses that support the
co., the balance-sheet doesn’t tell you the
real value of the assets. The “shares and
interests” in the subsidiary cos. are “invest-
ments at cost,” and some of these cos. may
now have extensive reserves, which, of
course, really belong to this co. On the
other hand, though this co. shows no good-
will or other hypothetical asset, a large
amount of the capital of the subsidiary cos.
may be represented by goodwill. The in-
vestor has to take a lot on trust; and thus
far he has been quite prepared to do it, and
it has paid him very well. In 1915, in addi-
tion to the 1\ p.c. dividend, he got a 5 p.c.
bonus. This year the directors say: “The
times we are passing through, and the uncer-
tainty of all financial conditions, including
the unknown quantity of war taxation, make
it desirable to pursue a conservative policy,
and to forego, for this year at least, the
payment of any bonus”—and the shareholder
who isn't blind will no doubt find the wink
as good as a nod. The co.’s liabilities total
£21,946, practically all money due to sub-
cos. The^ capital is £605,000.

A year ago this co.’s finance was a puzzle
to The Bulletin. On a capital of £29,198
it was holding £104,490 of deposits, while
it had no less than £45.801 in the bank on
fixed deposit, besides about £14,000 of till
money. This paper didn’t see how it could
pay a co. of this kind to take deposits and
pass them on to a bank, for it didn’t seem
probable that this co. could get money
cheaper than the banks. Apparently the
management wasn’t satisfied itself, and
during the past year it has paid off some
deposits. The total of the latter is therefore
reduced to £90,968. But it still has no
less than £31,233, for which it could find
no better use than to deposit with banks ;
and this is exclusive of £10,223 of till money
and money on current account. The posi-
tion has changed as follows in the 12
months: —
1915. 1916.
Capital .. £29,193 £29,305

Properties, etc 15,663 14,012
Investments . . .. .. 3,209 6,234
Deposits, etc 59,552 41,546
Its own funds plus the debentures on Sep-
tember 30 amounted to £58,069; and loans,
properties and balances owing on sales
totalled £104,268. The balance of £47,780
was in cash and as good as cash. From the
creditors’ point of view the position is A 1:
from the profit-earning point of view it is
nearer Zl. . Probably the co. accepted long-
term deposits in anticipation of business
which it is now disinclined to take; and
that disinclination does it credit. But the
means to do ill deeds make ill deeds done;
so the sooner the unnecessary deposits can
be paid off the better.

or “converted,” to employ a euphemism, at
2 p.c. over the rate of £3 12s. 6d. usually
paid by the six States. Before 192-'
£30,000,000 of Australian loans fall due, so
that it looks as though the new borrowings
will cost at least 2 p.c. more in interest, or
£6,000,000 per annum altogether, on money
borrowed and spent 30 years ago. The Vic-.
Railway Commissioners blame higher inter-
est for part of their deficit; the Premier
explains that he, too, suffers from mterest-
itis; and the Melbourne Board of Works
openly wails that it cannot convert its 3*
p.c. expiring loan to a p.c. issue because
the Broken Hill Proprietary offers 6 p.c.
for the £400,000 it needs to complete its iron
works at Newcastle. So that what The
Bulletin has preached for 30 years on the
subject of the thraldom created by having
to pay heavy interest to foreigners is being
graphically impressed upon all who are in
the habit of living on borrowed money. At
June, 1917, Australian Governments, muni-
cipalities and public boards will owe
£500,000,000; and 2 p.c. on that means
£10,000,000 more every year to be provided
by taxation. And don’t let us forget that
taxation means work. We’ve got that much
more work to do to keep the bailiff out.

It seems that it only just happens that way:
to be precise, the year’s net profit was
£150,000 18s. Bd., according to the books.
But, after all, the books only make a guess
at these matters. “Taxes, including provi-
sion for Federal and State income taxes and
war-profits taxation,” account for no less
than £102,713 of the revenue ; and it is at
least possible that some of this amount will
not be called for. Since the war started pro-
vision has been made for taxation as follows:
At Credit of
Appropriation. Taxation Account.
Sept., 1914 . . £3lB
Mar., 1915 .. 3,900
Sept., 1915 . . 18,401
Mar., 1916 .. 65,054 £81,750
Sept., 1916 . . 102,713 164,724
So the amount actually paid away in taxes
in the past two half-years was £1705 and
£19,(39; and £164,724 is now available to
meet future calls. The directors say—
The position in regard to taxation is quite inde-
finite, and the total amount may be higher or lower
than the provision made, which is based on war-time
profits tax at the rate of 50 p.c. As the Government
proposal is to take all excess profits after June 30,
1916, a further deduction from the net profit may
have to be made, but the directors hope that this
proposal will be modified.
Another sort of Board wouldn’t stuff money
away like that. This canny lot evidently
reckons that £150,000 is as much profit as a
co. of right-thinking patriots ought to be
showing in a half-year on a capital of
£1,289,000, for that’s 25 p.c. So it puts the
balance where the moths won’t eat it even
if the taxation commissioners do leave some
of it.
And that little matter of provision for taxes
that may or may not be collected is not the
only factor that makes the “profit” a mere
guess. At March 31 the co. had 2452 tons
copper not settled for, and this was taken
into account at £6O ner ton. The metal actu-
ally brought £136 Bs. 9d. Thus, over £187,000
of the past half-year’s profit consists of sur-
pluses realised on the previous half-year’s
product. Of the past half-year’s output only
473 tons were sold and settled for; the
balance, 2666 tons, though sold under con-
tract on a basis of average monthly prices,
has been taken into account at the usual £6O.
Assuming that £125 is realised, this will
mean that a surplus of £173.290 will fall into
the current half-year’s profit. In any case,
214 tons more copper was on hand at the
end than at the beginning of the half-year;
and if a surplus of £6O is computed on that,
it will give £12,840. which may fairly be
added to the past half-year’s profit. Apropos
of copper sales, the directors make the tran-
saction with the British Munitions Depart-
ment clearer than the politicians left it.
Off his own bat Hughes had, so it was
announced, sold the output of Lyell, Morgan
and the others. The directors don’t mention
Hughes in the matter. They say they have
sold their output “at a price equivalent to
£l2O per ton c.i.f. London, subject to the
renewal of existing contracts ; and if our con-
tract with the British Insulated and Helsby
Cables, Ltd., is renewed, this will mean that
the bulk of our production: will continue to
be sold at average prices.”
The next comparison shows what has been
done in this co.’s life and what remains to be
done:—
Extraction Reserves
since 10/8/’O3. at 31/3/’l6.
Mt. Lvell . . 3,094,357 tons 2,177,046 tons
North Lyell.. 1,480,704 „ 1,083,211 „
Two years ago North Lyell was estimated to
have 959,832 tons in reserve. Since then
247,224 tons have been extracted, and the
reserves are now estimated at 1,083,211 tons
—or were six months ago. And the bottom
hasn’t been found yet.
Out of the 4,575,061 tons of Lyell and
North Lyell ore handled by the present co.,
with a few thousand tons of odds and ends
from the smaller mines, £2.188,838 has been
paid in dividends = 9s. 7d. per ton. There
are 3,260,257 tons in reserve. On the same
scale the dividends would amount to
£1,562,500 = 245. 6d. per share. Bet there
are other things to be taken into account.
Besides paying the dividends the co. has
accumulated £433,088 of liquid assets in
excess of liabilities. Also, it has put large
sums of recent years into superphosphate
plants; and this business should be very
profitable in the future. On the other hand,
the ore left to be worked is rather poorer
than the ore from which the dividends have
been paid. But as against that must be set
the application of new processes. Costs, too,
are higher. But too much can be, and
generally is, made of the probable effect of
that. If costs are higher it is largely because
of the general rise in the gold-value of com-
modities ; and copper is just as likely to
share in that rise as anything. So the rise
in costs is very likely to be neutralised, or
partly so, by the improved value of the
product.

Boyd’s molybdenite mine, near Bathurst
(N.S.W.), is in the hands of a strong Syd-
ney-Melbourne option syndicate, which pro-
poses to get over the difficulty regarding the
formation of new cos. in Australia by
registering in Maoriland. There are, on
present appearances, larger possibilities in
this property than in any other molybdenite
show under notice in Australia.
* * * *
White - Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), is
considering a scheme to increase its share
capital. The contract to crush 4000 tons of
Carpathia ore was about half through when
the mill had to be hung up for repairs. This
concern doesn’t expect to earn dividends on
120,000 shares by treating customs ore, so
money is required to increase ore reserves.
Unfortunately, it isn’t a thing money can
always do.

The Palmer party scored a win in the
struggle between the two sections fighting
for control of the B. H. Junction North.
The chairman and two directors resigned,
leaving the Palmer party free to send in its
own men. This will silence for the time the
suggestion that the control of the mine and
works should be handed over to 8., M. and
Co., who run the Zinc Corporation.
* * * *
Amalgamated Hill End (N.S.W.) cleaned
up 158 oz. retorted gold from 90 tons, which
isn’t payable under existing conditions. An
inch or two of rich stone along the mica
vein provided most of the metal. But the
little mica vein is very short. From the
lower tunnel a crosscut has been driven east
in search of the Star of Peace reef. As luck
would have it, two veins were met with
carrying gold; but as it isn’t certain whether
the Star of Peace has been cut, driving lias
been continued.

In No. 2 run of the remodelled plant Y
Water (N.S.W.) in 1131 hours’ sluicing
time handled 147,000 cub. yds. for 50 tons
black tin. This was a big improvement on
No. 1 run, which was naturally affected by
opening out new ground and other pioneering
circumstances. The plant has proved itself
capable of treating 129 yards of washdirt
per hour, and this rapid sluicing on ground
that will yield over fib. of oxide per yard
must be dividend-paying at anything like
present prices. The unprofitable results
obtained last half-year were no criterion,
because of the shifting of the plant, the
opening-out operations on the western area,
etc. Manager Warlow Davies has gone into
tamp with the Engineers. He chose to be
a corporal at 9s. a day rather than accept
the offer of a big assistant-manager’s job,
worth anything from £l2OO to £l5OO a year.
That’s the effect the “No” vote has had on
some men.
* * * *
Bullrush (W.A.) is still unfortunate.
During the past year shortage and slackness
of labor have interfered with operations on
its sole surviving holding at Yuin, and now
work has ceased there altogether. The man-
ager reports that there are 5000 tons of
fully-developed payable ore above the 270 ft.
level, besides a few thousand tons of broken
stuff in the stopes; but to obtain the best
financial results about £7OOO more capital is
needed for development, which has been at a
standstill for some time.

A fine storm in a teapot occurred on the
Melbourne Stock Exchange when some
Westonia sports set a yarn afloat that
granite was shrouding the winzes at the
Edna Deeps. The young generation of hullo
wanted the nasty tittle-tattlers caged up,
but Bill Roberts isn’t to be caught that way.
Even the news tnat water was dribbling into
the stopes wouldn’t soften his resolution to
let rumor die a natural death. Stuckey
wired a comprehensive denial, but he doesn’t
seem to be quite the same old oracle. More-
over, the market got a shock when a day or
two later he related that greenstone or some-
thing equally troublesome was in the shaft,
and that the cement was being resumed—of
course, to keep the water out. But what
right La: there to be any dyke in the shaft
at all? Didn’t a bore down from 480 ft,
advise striking the reef at 30ft. below the
level with good stuff in the core? To gei
greenstone and oz. dirt looks a bit of n
come-down. But the dreamy bulls aren’t
bellowing over that. The reason is that
see that if the dyke is the one that shows at
the tail end of the Edna May lode in the
big mine there has been a surprising shorten-
ing of the shoot of ore. Besides, the dreary
fact is being driven home that as the under-
writers of the Deeps bonds got left with the
wad of £lO,OOO debentures offered to share-
holders, and as a lot of cash is still needed,
the co. may not be so very far off the call-
list as some people think. Altogether things
don’t look sweet at the Deeps.

“C.8.W.” : “Mararoa has taken the Bronco
Horseshoe (W.A.) on approval.” So The
Bulletin. It may do it—if the Federal
Treasurer allows registration, which is
doubtful. The Bronco, The Bulletin adds,
crushed 200 tons from development work at
the 50ft. for a value of 16s. per ton over a
width of 80ft. That’s right. I know,
because I bogged in and got out the dirt
single-handed. It left me heavily in debt, as
I anticipated. But I wanted to ascertain
true values over such an enormous body of
pre. The next crushings were taken from
the 135 ft. level to water (200 ft.) over a
width of about 40ft. Result: Approxi-
mately 2000 tons; value, 445. (from develop-
ment work). Great Victoria, same line,
covers costs of mining and milling at ss. Id.
per ton. The dirt can be broken for lOd. Costs
will be lower in the Bronco, where tributors
made as much as £S per week per man,
after carting eight miles —a w r aste of 255. per
ton. The Bronco is all right. It would
have been a big producer to-day if everybody
was in gaol who ought to be.
Williams’ United. Bendigo, having spent a
lot of cash dodging among the spurs at
2100 ft., gave up work at depth and had a
shot at the reef east of the shaft at 1644 ft.
The same old story was repeated there. Lots
of quartz in the reef and spurs, but mighty
little gold. Now the country of the 993 ft.
level is to be tested. T. J. Banner looks on
it as certain that he can get gold at 844 ft. if
he is allowed to put in a drive south to run
into the spurs in that direction. Though
the co. averaged only 4dwt. stone for the
last six months, it got through with one call
plus a lean on the banker to the extent of
£748. Teddy Dyason has swung on to the
board of this co., so look out!
. Support has been got for the Mitta Spring-
time, the Adelaide concern which is tackling
the big tin-bearing formations above Mitta
Mitta. Of the £25 reserved shares 200 go
out, and if the holders are lucky only a tenner
will be called up, w r hereupon the device will
be adopted of writing up the shares to £25
by making a call of £l5 and paying a bonus
at once of a like amount. This arrangement
will permit the newcomers to rank equal as
to rights with old holders. Manager Bill
McGregor plans to have 12 faces of ore to
draw from, and he italicises that he expects
to keep up a 2 p.c. to 3 p.c. average in tin
oxide. _lf he does, Mount Bischoff will have
to go into retirement, and things will hum
round Mitta Mitta as they never did before.
McGregor’s estimate of “all in” costs is ss.
per ton. This is considerably above J. B.
Lewis’s record at the Anchor mine in Tas-
mania : but Lewis only had about 4s. 6d.
stuff to treat, so McGregor ought to have a
pretty solid margin to work on. He isn’t
sticking to the old-fashioned battery, but
pins faith to an entirely new invention that
is to do the work of a 30-head stamp mill.
Experimenting in plant on a new show
doesn’t usually spell economy, though.
What with scratches to show hilly ground,
green ink to point out rising slopes and
black lettering to let the world know “This
area has been close bored and proved unpay-
able,” the Trong Tin, Perak, plan looks un-
healthy. This explains the muffled tone in
which the office talks nowadays, compared
with its joyous chatter before the dredge,
started. If the dredge plunges along as it
has done in the last six months it won’t be
long before it will be nosing round for some-
thing to do. The half-year’s record was
397,000 cub. yds., giving 144 tons tin oxide,
or an average of 0.8121 b. per cub. yd. Bar-
rister Meagher explains: “The ground is of
very uneven values. At times the tin oxide
shows freelv in the buckets, wdiich indicates
rich ground : at others it is very poor; all
of which, however, is not inconsistent with
the values as shown in the original boring.”
The co. at the end of October had a credit
balance of £4250. This was after wiping
out sundry _ creditors and paying a shilling
div., absorbing £3300. November has seen
another shilling, and as the last clean-up has
been most profitable, there ought to be a
cheery Christmas ahead. But, after all,
what barrister Meagher has to explain is
whether Trong has come g crash, or whether
only a small crack has been revealed.
8., M. & Co. are about to have another
shuffle. Coring, who now has his own letter
heads, retains his interest in the firm' hr
remains in Frisco indefinitely. Wether
partner, Wellstead, is coming to Austrah ' i
search of health and possibly to take a hand
in the local management. W. A Macleod
who has bossed the show in Westralia since
J. A. Agnew joined the Hoovers and Gove*t
is going to take a job in the London office'. ’
*** . #
This, is glittering. Melbourne-owned
Philippine Dredging, with four machines at
work, produced 21300 z. of gold in October
This good return was due mainly to the run
of highly-payable washdirt operated by No
2 dredge, which turned over 80,000 cub yds’
for an average of 6.7 grs. per yard. ’ '

The coal strike has given the Speck’s
water-power a great advt. Instead cf
worrying about stocks of fuel, Hobart knows
that if the stnke lasts a year or years
the electric lights would still be " able to

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, November 27, 1016.
My Dear Arini, —
Pilgrims travelling to the Society of
Artists’ show in Queen Victoria Markets
on Saturday afternoon panted up the stairs.
Lifts were “off” after midday—like toast in
those exclusive boarding-houses where gas
has been the fuel. There w r ere various
cryptic notices to the effect that if you
chanced to break your neck on the darker
stairway, Heaven help you! It was to be
.no concern of the City Council. The final
climb, up a corkscrew staircase, is always
liftless, so that wasn’t an unexpected worry
for plump citizens. But the heat was. Pink
and purple countenances, under the glazed
roof, were assiduously mopped before the
visitors gasped their way into the speech-
making.
Julian Ashton, in the course of his re-
marks, referred to the good effect of the
Society’s homely walls of sacking—a dull
buff that doesn’t hit the eye—and he hoped
the mulberry stain in the Education Gallery
would soon be obliterated. Artists, by the
way, were allowed to choose the color for
that long picture tunnel. Women, accus-
tomed to buy from drapers’ patterns, can
evidently judge better than men of the
effect of a big piece from a small one. The
artists liked mulberry in a sample. But
they’ve hated the new gallery walls as
fiercely as the lay visitor t ever since they
saw it in gross. After Julian had laid down
the law brand-new Minister for Educa-
tion James intimated his desire to see the
Government found an Art School—to help,
not rival, local artists. All is going to be
lovely in the garden whenever a new gar-
dener comes along.
The Tom Hughes lady was as cool as any
in a soft muslin gown; Mrs. Max Allan
floated around in similar airy drapery.
Artists Minns, Gruner, Florence Rodway,
Lionel Lindsay and Syd Ure Smith
struggled through the crowd to personally
conduct their friends to the other fellow’s
wares. John Lane Mullins and his slim
lady, Justice Street (a sympathetic buyer
of Australian artists’ work), G. W.
Hadfield (from the rival art shop) and
goodness knows how many more were
squeezed in.
The concert to help the Lewisham Hos-
pital was to have been held in the Town
Hall on Saturday night. Indefinitely post-
poned. They haven’t started yet to light-up
that big barn with hurricane lamps. For a
like reason the St. John Ambulance meet-
ing, the annual affair, is also crossed off.
In the thick of the coal strike, when the
world was dark, Vivian Wybern Smith,
lieutenant of Field Artillery, made Meta
Victoria Parkes a soldier’s wife. But there
was plenty of color and light at St.
Stephen’s, with a side-line of kerosene lamps
in case the electrics changed their mind,
and a bower of white and pink blooms to go
wfith the bridal silver-and-pink and lace and
tulle. The only bridesmaiden w T as a Watteau
in floral silkery, while a brother-in-arms,
Norman Macleod, was on hand to produce
the ring at the right moment. After the
wedding the ’groom’s unit from the Warren
formed an arch of ribboned whips, and then,
regimental banner flying (given to the bride
afterwards), towed the newly-weds to the
Australia, where more festivities were pro-
ceeded with. The ’groom is a son of “Pearl”
Smith, who owns a captain’s uniform as well
and gave it an airing last Tuesday.
That hearty old chestnut, “Charley’s
Aunt,” will be dusted and brought out of
its locker on December 2 at the Palace
Theatre. The show is for the Cremorne
branch of the Red Cross.
The French Music Society had its third
concert just before the lights went out; so
the luscious smell of smoky kerosene-lamps
didn’t distract the audience. Eugenie
Boland, Arthur Appleby—in better voice
than at some former sing-songs—and Frank
Hutchens assisted.
Prof. Andy Stuart opened the exhibition
of R. Sidney Cocks’s water-colors in Hor-
derns’ gallery. In a fine Doric roll of the
R’s, the strenuous Scot explained the length
and breadth of the all-Australian show. This
done, he cajoled the long, shy artist, who
looked as if he’d rather be hanged, to mur-
mur a breathless sentence about the exhibi-
tion being now open. It was manager
Gillett, of Horderns’, who, so that the public
might see the work of a man who hid his
easel and himself away in a Blue Mountain
eyrie, arranged the show; and he had a few
words to too.
The National Gallery owns samples of
Sidney Cocks’s brushwork. In the years
that are dust he wandered over Europe
painting as he wandered, and in Italy
picked up the delicate fantasy of mist and
cloud effect which he now wreathes round
his Mountain sketches.
Candies have returned, with all their
spluttering wickedness, to every other tea-
room in our twilight city. Greatly daring,
the manageresses of some of the smaller
retreats drape the protesting sperm with
crinkled paper. Only the inscrutable ways
of Providence stand between the flimsy
decorations and a bonfire. Perhaps, when
one comes to think of it. Providence is
helped by the watchfulness of the patrons
who hurriedly bang down a saucer and put
out the flame just as the crisis approaches.
City women are apparently as scared of
lamps as our grandmothers would have been
of bottled lightning. In a little back shop
in an arcade I saw two villainous-looking
caudles—of the melted-fat persuasion—send-
ing rivers of grease down their guttering
sides. “The draught catches them,” ex-
plained the lady behind the counter. “But
they’re much safer than lamps!” Then she
snatched some lacy hangings from the fierce
red end of the wick, and the fire brigade
wasn’t sent for.
Since the return of candles no one is sur-
prised at the once fervent admiration of
beauties in their 60’s. Wasn’t Ninon de
l’Enclos supposed to have been nearly three-
score when she was doing a record business
in breaking hearts? Modern arc-lights are
trying to even ivory-white complexions, and
the present candle gleam is borne with
equanimity by the lady who knows it adds
50 per cent, to her charms.
The Wilfred Stead pair spent a few days
in Sydney before boarding the Niagara for
their native heath near Napier. The success-
ful Sasanoff got a berth, too, after some
delay. It is rumored he had the cabin de
luxe. Anyway, it cost some cash to house
the golden horse. Partner Ted Luttrell sped
back to Christchurch a week earlier.
The Mosrnan Musical Society has just
finished a five-nights’ incursion into opera.
“Martha” was the lady’s name. The leafy
suburb gave a reasonable measure of sup-
port, and exes, were about cleared. Mabel
Batchelor, Dorrie Ward, J. Yuill and Willie
Beattie were the principals. Beattie en-
listed, and was just about to sing his little
song .to Fritz when a bout of pneumonia
knocked that season on the head —for a
while, anyhow.
Pianist F. S. Kelly, who delighted Sydney
audiences with his recitals a few winters
ago, has been killed in France. He was the
bright and shining member of the “Tin”
Kelly family—a distinguished success in
everything he undertook.
Did you happen to meet Jack London
when he was here? Most of his time in Syd-
ney was spent in a private hospital recover-
ing from the effects of his “pleasure” trip
in the Snark. That was after he and his
plucky little wife had just missed being
eaten by the Best People in our cannibal
isles. Jack’s personality was charming. He
was a tall, fair-haired, clean-shaved, blue-
eyed, typical outdoor man, and looked
younger than his years, which only reached
41 in the end. At a local dinner given in
his honor the guests were solemnly warned
not to wear evening-dress. That was against
the lion’s unconventional beliefs. So the
high-necks waited, expecting the famous
Jack to dash into the house clad in miner’s
garb or wearing some kind of weird nauti-
cal kit." Instead, he was as spruce as a
tailor could make him. Cream silk shirt and
superfine black suit showed that the lion
had been mindful of his mane. The coat
was* a dinner-jacket—the swallow without a
tail so much favored in modern suburbs.
Mrs. Jack’s hobbies appeared to be to travel
as uncomfortably as possible and to wear
enormous rings on every other finger.
Mrs. Herbert Cunningham, of Chip Chase,
Wollstonecraft, and her daughter, Mrs.
Henderson, left on Friday with passports
and pyjamas for London, by way of Panama.
Farewells occupied their final fortnight.
Partly the flight is due to artist Fairlie
Cunningham. She decided not to return to
Sydney yet. but to sign on for six months
more V.A.D. at Brighton; and her sister
takes up a similar strenuous life. Her hus-
band, Mac Alister Henderson, died of pneu-
monia in camp here just after the great
strife commenced. A squatter brother,
Robert Henderson, from Queensland, left
on Thursday in the Niagara for the other
end and khaki. His wife and nursery went,
too, as far as Vancouver.
The friends and pupils of teacher Ada Gee
gave her a good-bye concert in the Repertory
the other night. Then she left for England
to chaperon her star contralto, Vera Cree.
Vera, as you know, goes to a scholarship
at the Royal Academy.
Graythwaite convalescent home for
soldiers at North Sydney hopes to get. an
extra chicken or two in the pot when the
cash from a recent fete at Crow’s Nest is
counted. The local branch of the Red Cross
was the lever that worked the effort, and the
Hay dame put on her best bonnet to set it
going.
Special interest attaches to the Apollo
Club’s sing-song on December 6. Alfred
Hill, now in charge, will steer the voices
through some of his “Hinemoa” music. Max
Vogrich, a conductor of the society in the
early days, and now leading a choir
beyond the Shadows, is to be remembered.
His arrangement of “Nazareth” makes the
special Christmas item.
The French-Australian League is mother-
ing Marie de Valmont, who was studying
singing at the Paris Conservatoire when the
Germans got busy. The refugee hailed
originally from Smyrna, whose trench ana
British inhabitants have been mostly caged
in that hornets’-nest. After fleeing hither
and thither, and losing her brother, and
being attacked on a Greek steamer by the
Hun’s submarine, Miss de almont con-
trived to reach Sydney. There’s a concert
in St. James's Hall on November 00, at
which some of the singing will be done by
this heroine of adventures that would have
filled the Castle of Otranto with sighs. Then
she hopes to take her voice to ’Murka till
the storm blows over.
The Battleplane Committee frizzled in the
Sock Fund’s room the other afternoon while
Mrs. Tom Watson read the latest news.
Money comes in slowly. But it comes, and
the steady drip of the wash-house tap has
filled many a tub before to-day. The Albert
Gould lady reigned serenely in the chair;
and treasurer Bryant, of the Union Bank, is
still waiting for your shilling.
The Anglican Synod will use its best
apron for a bib at a luncheon to mark its
jubilee. December 5 is the date, and Gover-
nor Strickland will handle a knife and fork
at the party.
Another clever Sydney girl, Gladys, the
versatile daughter of Langer Owen, K.C.,
looks at you in this little portrait, by Misses
C. and B. Macfarlane. An artist by instinct,
Gladys is also a true daughter of Australia.
Since the war. dropping her palette, she has
a fine record of Red Cross service. As one
of the joint hon. secs, of the Sydney league,
she must sign her name times innumerable
every week. But this is only the quiet side.
The conscription issue brought out a new
Gladys Owen —a magnetic speaker who, at
the clear call of her brothers in the trenches,
clambered on any handy vehicle and poured
out rousing appeals to Australia to vote
“Yes.”
Among his friends Sydney Ure Smith is
regarded as a rare humorist. If he and
his partner Harry Julius could not make
a living as commercial artists, they ought
to be able to coin money in a vaudeville
turn. In office hours Syd designs ads. which
are effective as well as artistic, and he was
responsible for the charming get-up of the
Ililder memorial volume. At home he
makes etchings and prints them on the same
press that “Hop” used over 20 years ago.
“Hop” was the pioneer of the etchers’ art
in Australia and induced a number of other
artists to take up the needle. The public
wasn’t interested and their enthusiasm died.
Now there is a demand for this form of
art, especially when it preserves what there
is of interest in our architectural past.
Syd Smith had made a great many pen
or pencil drawings of these relics and illus-
trated three or four books relating to Old
Sydney before he began to use the new
medium in earnest. Most of his etchings
are of the survivals of Macquarie’s building
frenzy, and the old mills and doorways are
handled with the gentle precision of one
who loves them. The N.S.W. Art Gallery
has bought five of these prints during
the year, a number are now at the Society
of Artists’ show, and early next month a
collection of them will be exhibited in the
Centreway, Melbourne, together with a few
black-and-white drawings and water-colors
by Norman Lindsay and some paintings by
J. R. Jackson.
Bishop Julius, of Christchurch (M.L.), is
giving up his episcopal palace and retiring
into a small humpy. No, not humility;
merely Mary Ann. It’s a shack or a board-
ing-house, and a boarding-house is ecclesias-
tically impossible. “Field Flowers Mel-
bourne, Fourth Floor,” would break up any
diocese.
Mrs. Dicky Richards had to send in her
papers to the Red Cross executive, and
everyone is sorry. Sydney’s gentle ex-
Mayoress isn’t improving in health, ana
she’s going to sit back for a while and watch
the other girls make the wheels spin.
That fine old sport Dr. Fiaschi, who did
such heavy bullockirtg at Lemnos Hospital,
is now with the Italian army. And as most
of the army is mounting dizzy heights,
Fiaschi will have to climb up after it.
From a Sydney girl at the Duchess of
Westminster’s Hospital:—
Out of some 40 Australian officers in hospital here,
somewhere in France, there are three D.S.O. s in-
cluding a mere babe of 21, and a captain at that
and two M.C.’s; and two others have V.C.’s in the
family: not bad, eh ? And there are lots more who
wish they wore the Billjim stars. A good many of
those who came across in the early days of the war
to get commissions are just aching to join the Aus-
tralian Army—now that they cannot. Two Aus-
tralian bands visit us weekly and amuse and inter-
est the French populace—which consists mostly of
convalescents —by the vigor and enthusiasm they
put into what the English call “their strange
music.’’ The members of one band gave a rattling
good concert the other night. But why, oh why,
does the reciter always choose Kipling in prefer-
ence to home-made verse and story ? It is
good to see the brown faces and jaunty hats; even
to hear an occasional good frank old blanky.
Dr. Lucy Gullett, back from the thrills of
surgical work in France, told the L- e d
Cross dames all about it the other after-
noon. A daughter of the late noted ;jour-
nalist Henry, she has a graphic style _of
condensing her facts. What France is doing
for the wounded, backed by the British Red
Cross, is nearing the perfection of human
organisation. The Sydney woman saw the
miserable wrecks, kindly returned by the
enemy when his internment camps have con-
verted them into hopeless consumptives.
Here we fatten the Hun till he has to puft
out his old refrain: “Ve vill vin—ve vill vin
in der longk run.”
The Russian duet, Mirovitch and Piastro,
passed through Sydney on their way to
Adelaide from Maoriland. There’s a hint ot
their coming back to Sydney either after
another look at the East or before they tap
the golden Orient.
Mrs. Edmund Fosbery, the homely old
lady whose husband was Sydney’s principal
policeman for so many years, died last week.
She passed away in Eaton, one of Darling-
hurst’s old homes, which turns its green
ficus whiskers to a road filled with the clatter
of trams. She was the one member of a
lively family—the Gordon girls are her
granddaughters —for whom Society pranks
had no lure.
John Mac Cormack has been inquiring how
everyone is at this comparatively peaceful
end of the world. You know what that
means. With all his personal charm and
silvery song, John is hard to handle, from
a manager’s point of view. So he may bring
himself, with the help of his devoted ally,
the Immense Me Sweeney.
The Babies’ Kit Society, now in 17 Bond-
street, is still pegging away at building and
rebuilding garments for desolate Belgian
infants. There’s a fairly comforting
thought in sending these kits across the
water. The German soldier can’t eat a
petti even though it’s only the size of Miss
Muffitt’s drapery; and he’s mostly too fat
to wear it. So baby is pretty sure to get
all that’s sent her. About 100,000 garments
have already gone. Hundreds of the tod-
dlers are in Northern France, in the care of
nuns, and other kits are distributed amongst
the baby refugees in England.
Dot Brunton opened the Peter Pan Club's
effort for the Alexandra Hospital. Tittell
Brune gave her name to the club in its
early days, so it likes to retain the theatri-
cal flavor. The party was in the roomy
garden of the Cornish mansion out Ocean-
street way. Secretary Clarence Moss told
the company of the dwindling funds of this
Children’s Hospital. And then a storm broke
like a gigantic packet of crackers, and the
frothy muslin frocks of the youngsters flew
across the lawn like balls of thistledown.
Leonard Redmond, of Charters Towers,
where father has a doctor’s practice, is
engaged to a former Bananaland girl.
Christina Williamson. She’s a cousin of
Mrs. Andy Fisher, and lives nowadays in
Sydney.
The cables told us of Captain de la Poer
Beresford’s marriage. The Australian man,
who is in the 10th Lancers, India, has been
staff-officer in France since the early days of
the war. The bride, Margaret Thynne, is
the daughter of an English parson.
Fancy the feelings of a burglar who got
away with the Russian order of St. Ann!
Yet that’s amongst the loot lately taken
from the Henry Katers’ house in Woollahra.
There’s a reward of £2OO for the missing
Ann and other valuables that belonged to
Kater, pere, B\R.S.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN`.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, November 27, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Steeplechase Day arrived at last on Satur-
day, and though it began with blazing sun-
shine, a thunderstorm crashed in and tried
to stop the big race itself with torrents
of tropical rain. The horses were then
lining up for the start and were held back
for a while in hopes ol a break, but the field
eventually scuttered through mud with the
rearmost horses and jockeys coming in
blinded with rain and flying clods. When
the heavens burst again secretary Byron
Moore had a despairing look in his eye. He
had come out in fine summer-day rig—pale
grey, with lovely cat’s-eye buttons jewelling
the waistcoat —and it may have been the
possible ruination of his lovely costume that
troubled him. In a twinkling the world of
Flemington seemed to turn back to its old
flooded state. People had to splash through
a river to reach the elms from the stand or
return from the birdcage to the lawn.
Women penned up in the members’ tea-rooms
were rescued by their menfolk with um-
brellas, and then the dainty white race-boots
and shoes had to go paddling. (Even poor
Billjim in the trenches has to paddle.) The
rattled tea girls and waiters fell into a panic
and rushed about, dashing crockery in
front of females who were wailing for justice
and tea. The thunder turned the milk sour
and curdled the temper of the tea drinkers,
for a ravenous horde had got in early and
devoured most of the food. Poor wretches
of women!
Before the Deluge there were some dainty
gowns on view. Mrs. Lavendo Tye wore
pink muslin and stuck a saucy little pastel-
pink hat over one eyebrow. She walked the
birdcage chaperoning two eligible young
bachelors, while hovering flappers viewed the
visitors with the appraising eye that punters
cast over the processional horses. Mrs.
Ambrose Pratt wore the white muslin of a
summer day. The Forrest dame’s niece
Muriel walked in muslin and blue spots.
Mrs. Andelosia Cooper’s frock was a dainty
all-in-one draping of dull blue and em-
broidery. Mrs. Leslie Macdonald got a great
lawn effect out of one garment of black
broadcloth that had been poured on to her;
there were no signs of fastenings or joinings
anywhere. A large, fat woman in navy blue,
with startled ospreys in her hat, topped the
whole with an absurd little Early Victorian
parasol—three inches of petunia silk and six
inches of lace. Mrs. Jeffries, in fawn, piloted
a fair daughter in black and gold. Gaud
Mayor Hennessy, in the fashionable mascu-
line pale grey, risked a pinch of gold on a
horse in the Steeplechase. Mrs. Tom Whyte,
in blue and white, scored with a gold-
embroidered veil. Mrs. Barry Thompson
wore very short blue skirts, with silk stock-
ings and shoes to match. Mrs. Connolly’s
black taffetas race-coat had a fashionable
flare.
The huge crowd on the flat seemed to
melt in the rain. The first downpour was
so overwhelming that not one black speck
hesitated. A running tide of humans scur-
ried for the fences everywhere, and one girl
in white, making for shelter, took all the
jumps in great style, but was finally baulked
by the rose-garlanded fence before the
grandstand lawn. After trying this, she
retreated, amid applause, and steeplechased
back to the flat.
Just before Cup Day the dress specialist
at a big shop missed one of her precious
race-frocks. Instinct led her to Flemington
with two detectives in leash. They spotted
the masterpiece on a lawn promenader, and
there was a terrific scene, during which the
wearer all but fainted. She said she bought
the dress for £4 10s. from a woman un-
known. The usual yarn, of course : but in
this case it was true. At the City Court it
was proved that a woman had offered the
dream to several other persons. A barmaid
said she would have taken it, but there was
rather too much of her. The widow in dis-
tress was then discharged. Thereupon the
dress lynx, as authorised on proof of inno-
cence, gave the costume to her as a keep-
sake. The poor thing had earned it.
One young woman down for the races
almost caused a feminine riot. She is little
more than a bride and has so much money
that she was expected to show at least two
dazzling costumes per day. Instead of
doing so, she wore the same plain, comfort-
able coat and skirt to every meeting. This
in spite of the fact that she was staying at
the smartest hotel in the midst of the chronic
over-dressers.
The wails of racing women were loud in
the land at the end of last week. The rich
young Falkiner dame, who has just taken
possession of Redcourt, her new Dandenong-
road town house, arranged a patriotic party
and fete for Saturday, and heaps of the most
swaggah young matrons engaged themselves
in advance as stallholders or assistants,
never dreaming that bad weather would
string out the Flemington races till the
postponed Steeplechase fell on that date.
Hastings Cooper, a paper merchant and
rich young eligible widower, is back from
an American trip still unattached. Mel-
bourne girls noted the fact with sighs of re-
lief. The young man was prominent during
the mild race-time frivols and made the
flapper diners-out yearn prettily when he
talked of caf€ dinners in New York. One
youth with a lot of money he hadn’t earned
gave a dinner at which girls danced on glass
above the diners’ heads. The houris let
themselves down on golden wires to snatch
champagne glasses from the masculine guests.
Just the sort of innocent merriment for
war time. At another dinner party (men
only) a huge melon was served to each
guest. As the melon was cut out leaped a
lovely dancing deaconess and handed her
liberator a tract. At least, I hope that’s
what happened.
Kerriesdale, the homestead and squattage
of rich mining-man Doolette, has been
bought by the Etheridges, and Mrs. Etheridge
celebrated it by giving a race-time tea-party
that stretched the whole length of the new
Australia supper-room. The affair reeked
with war-time economy. The dishes were
served in confectionery baskets; the straw-
berries reposed in a bed of sugar roses
veiled in a gold spider’s web of spun sugar;
the fish savories came out of a basket
of coral and pearl shells. High, slender sil-
ver vases held orchids. Mrs. Saddler, of
Toorak, wore black and veiled-gold trim-
mings; Mrs. Thompson (Brighton) nodded
pink roses over her coffee; and Mrs. Barry
Thompson wore brown fluffy frills and a
Dolly Varden hat. Mrs. Connolly’s hat
boasted pansies, like real flowers, flattened
on the crown. The hostess was clad in blue,
with a cute little French cockade in her
hat. Mostly, as you will see, a sporting lot.
Secretary Byron Moore has had such
worries this race-time in looking over Flem-
ington when it is in flood that mere women
wonder how he keeps his lovely flowing beard
dry. He never wears it bundled into a
bathing-cap on race days, and it must be
quite as much worry as the long flowing
locks of womenkind. A mere woman can
never go bathing without resorting to the
rubber cap or spending an hour or two getting
the mane dry. That lovely, well-groomed
beard is a wonder.
BYRON MOORE.
When Melba slid off to Sydney en route
to Honolulu, Spencer-street writhed with ex-
citement. The application for platform-
tickets was like the storming of the gallery
early-door on a first-night, and the singer’s
carriage resembled a florist’s shop. Whilst
telegram boys strolled up furiously with
farewell wires “Melba’s girls” swarmed round
the window and yelped for notice. Some-
where handy stood the two Honolulans,
young Carruthers and Peggie Center, the
latter wearing a pretty bonnet and a bad
toothache. The station was decorated with
George Allan, John Lemmone and Fritz
Hart, in various shades of loyal dejection ;
whilst daughter-in-law Mrs. George Arm-
strong winked away a tear as the Conserva-
torium girls tipped a stave of “Auld Lang
Syne.” Finally, Julius Knight, wearing a
very pink shirt and beads of perspiration,
flung a bunch of Beaucaire roses after the
disappearing train.
Mrs. lies is in Melbourne on a visit. Her
husband is a young Tasmanian who has
made his name as a mining expert in Lon-
don. He picks up something like £5OOO a
year just for giving a little advice now and
then. Mrs. lies is an Englishwoman and is
trying to overcome her terror of submarines
so as to return to hubby. On her journey
hither she saw two boats torpedoed.
Dr. Janet Greig is in hospital suffering
from severe concussion. She was knocked
down in St. Ivilda-road by a motor-cyclist
while waiting for a tram outside her own
gate.
1 Chaplain William Hall, who was senior
instructor at the Naval College at Jervis
Bay before he got back to his job with the
British bovs, has been killed. Hall, though
good at his work, was a neurotic sqbject
who did not hit it with our Naval Board.
His wife, who lived with a son and daughter
at Toorak whilst the Naval Instructor was
on duty at Geelong (one simply could n’t
live in Geelong, you know!), openly ad-
mitted an antipathy to Australia and Aus-
tralians. Naturally it did not help her
socially. When last heard of the naval cleric
had a job on a battleship.
Western District heiress Violet Thornley,
who drifted to London with the Fred Fair-
bairn family and Ivath McCulloch in search
of a war job, was disappointed. Anyhow,
she is coming back to help with Australian
patriotics.
From “Rosna,” of London: —
The newest weddings in this Isle included those
of Capt. Frank Weir, of the Ist Light Horse, who is
one of the Deniliquin Weirs, to Miss Isherwood, of
Manchester; and Lieut. Leslie Marks, son of the
late Albert Marks, one time of Maoriland, to Lea
Benjamin, daughter of the Saunders Benjamins, who
are now dwelling at Hampstead.
The Montague Laings—he is managing director
for Sargoods in London and hails from Wellington
(M.L.)—are mourning the death of their elder
daughter, Mollie, a charming and popular girl, who
has been strenuously war-working, like most Miss
Anglo-Australanas. The Laings’ only son Charles
has a commission in the Royal Scots Fusiliers and
won a Military Cross for bravery at Gallipoli.
Engagements that have just burst upon Anglo-
Australia include that of Harold Penfold, who has
a commission in the Royal Engineers and is a son
of Dr. Penfold, of Bendigo, to Erica Blunden, of this
Isle.
Young Keith George, of the chiffon family,
who laid down his job as advertising mana-
ger of the firm in time to get away with our
first Broadmeadows lot, has been killed in
France. For two long years he was in the
firing-line, where he earned his commission.
A mate who dined with this good-looking
young Australian when he was in London on
short leave, says he had become almost
stone-deaf from shell shock, a matter which
worried him not at all. A pretty fiancee
mourns with the dead soldier’s people.
Mrs. Fred Rowe is killing the fatted
turkey for daughter Jessie (Mrs. Richards),
who is arriving from India with her soldier-
husband, now on furlough. He is a wireless
man of high degree, and before the war used
to plant in Ceylon.
The Philip Mortons of Sydney are tarry-
ing in Melbourne after the Cup, because
Mrs. Philip has to. She is recuperating in
Mount St. Evins hospital after a successful
operation by Dr. Tom Dunhill. The Mel-
bourne florists are praying that her recovery
may be slow though sure, as their shops are
ransacked daily for presentation blooms for
the invalid’s room. Pretty girleens Ruth
and Jean decorate dull old Eastern Hill
during their frequent visits to cheer the
sufferer.
The death of Brig.-General Duncan Glas-
furd will sadden a lot of friends. Glasfurd,
a fighting Scot, had served with the Argyle
and Sutherland Highlanders, and came to
Australia as director of military training, in
which job he did excellent but unostentatious
work. He leaves behind him three young
boys, one of whom has just entered Osborne
College; the other two are still at school in
Geelong. Mrs. Stewart Balmain acted as
foster-mother whilst she was here, Glasfurd
being an old regimental mate of her hus-
band’s. During her absence solicitor Ted
Fitz Gerald has kept an eye on the fatherless
kiddies.
Adelaide’s diary for the week :—•
The Acacias, the Edwin Smith home at Marryat-
ville, was handed over to a committee on Saturday
as a money-magnet for the benefit of the Queen’s
Home. For a change the weather was fine, and cash
rolled in. A couple of good concerts in the ball-
room and picturesque tea- and sweet-stalls helped to
swell the purse. The Cheer-Up Society opened its
billiard-room on the same afternoon, and Brig.-
General Irving was the marker. That day, too,
Prospect staged its postponed “repatriation” car-
nival. The Governor attended this show, and the
rush on the early-door tickets brought in an extra
few shillings.
Good reports arrive of the work done by Merle
Robertson, the Elder Scholar, who is at the Royal
College of Music, London. Sir C. H. Parry sums
the results up: “A capital and creditable record for
the first term.”
Olive Norman, who left as a nurse for the
French Red Cross League, is now at work at the
Hospital Militaire Anglais, Limoges, after a spell in
London.
There is still a bit of money about, wherefore
Grenfell-street is to have new buildings. Some tumble-
down places near Gawler Place are to make way
for new premises for Harris-Scarfe’s, and Tatter-
sail’s Club is pulling down the quarters it has
occupied for the last 22 years so that it may build
new ones on the site. Time was when the spot
was occupied by a one-storey house in which the late
Dr. Gosse had his surgery, and after him came G.
and J. Morphett and R. I. and W. Stow.
The omission of Mount Schank, near Mount Gam-
bier, from the nomenclature committee’s list of
names to be changed, upset some patriotic spirits
until it was pointed out that the hill was called
after a British admiral who laid the foundations of
the Society for the Promotion of Naval Architecture.
In the midst of the ignorance a descendant has
dropped a note to W. J. T. Clarke to say that the
family owes nothing to foreign blood, and that
Schank is a good old British name. (Hear, hear.)
The Red Cross Committee has been faced with
the problem that confronts Red Cross committees in
other States, i.e., what use to make of Rest Homes
when English hospitals are absorbing our wounded.
In agreement with the military authorities it has
been decided to keep the Mareeba Home going, and
to temporarily cut down the duties and hours of
attendance of the Voluntary Aids. But don’t let
that interfere with your enthusiasm for the support
of the ordinary work of the Society.
The engagement is announced of Nancy, second
daughter of the C. L. Taylors, of Strathalbyn, to
Hubert, the third son of the late Mortimer Gileses.
The soldiers’ toy factory is so rushed with orders
that larger premises are wanted. Already contracts
have come in from as far afield as Westralia, and
the returned Billjims are enthusiastic about the
job, which, incidentally, is being run on the co-
operative system, under the management of the State
War Council.
The crowd that gathered to celebrate J. J. Virgo’s
30 years of Y.M.C.A. work nearly filled the. Exhibi-
tion Hall on Wednesday evening, when the Governor
and other wellwishers said their complimentary piece.
“J.J.,” an Adelaide boy, began as General Secretary
of this State’s branch of the Association 30 years
ago, and graduated to headquarters at London. This
week’s appeal for funds for Adelaide’s new Y.M.C.A.
building brought in nearly £13,000, including a
bequest of £lOOO made by the late R. Barr Smith
and £2600 which was in reserve.
The Repatriation Day Committee has its nose
well to the grindstone over the arrangements for
December 15, which are to be much the same as
those that ruled Australia Day. Mrs. Crawford
Vaughan is chief miracle-worker of the committee
that will feed the multitude on Parliament House
lawn, at the Exhibition Building, in the Town Hall
and at Victoria Square. The Repatriation race meet-
ing brought nearly £l5OO to the Fund, and other
nettings have scooped over £2OOO.
Mary Kitson, a daughter of a well-known detective,
will, all going well, be admitted to the Bar next
year. She will be our first LL.B. Novelist Doris
Egerton Jones tried her hand at the horsetail trade
several years ago, but gave it up. It was for her
that the Act allowing women to practise as solicitors
was originally passed.
George Marlow came to Melbourne for the
Cup that was filled with rain, and dashed
away in a fury on Friday’s express, the day
before the gallop. He is now in Brisbane
seeing that his wife is being nursed pro-
perly. The plump little lady has had hard
luck lately; she had only just recovered
from appendicitis when some careless hand
at a N. S. Wales mountain hotel left a cellar
trapdoor ajar. The convalescent fell several
feet and hurt her knee badly.
The Tommy Reynolds pair are coming to
settle in Melbourne (Australian playgoers
knew Mrs. Tommy as “Suzanne” Maggie
Jarvis). They have just taken the St.
Ivilda-road house of that Jacobs who is
brother of Justice Isaacs’s wife. The Jacobean
furniture was sold last Monday—a dusty
north-wind day that took all the starch and
enthusiasm out of the cloud of dames who
wafted along to have a good inspection of
the innards of the house.
Melba’s stage manager, Rigaud, is still in
Melbourne putting in a quiet time at Coombe
while the chieftainess is away.
Bindley, of the Bendigo Conservatorium of
Music (located in Collins-street), is whip-
ping up local enthusiasm for his 21st Stu-
dents’ Concert this week.
The Con. pupils—more especially Melba’s
bunch —are involved in a forthcoming pro-
duction at the Playhouse, when Gluck’s
three-act opera “Iphigenia” will be given
with full orchestra and chorus of 70 voices,
under the direction of Fritz Hart. It will
all happen on Thursday evening, December 7.
Melba, of course, will be away, but she has
had a great deal to do with the rehearsals.
The aesthetic Carruthers, who is travelling
back to Honolulu on the same ship, proved
himself “a perfect dear ” by stencilling lovely
robes for the chorus. He bequeathed the
balance of his job to Mrs. Fritz Hart when
he departed, and she has been working hard
at it ever since. The girls have helped at
the more prosaic stitching. Little Mrs. Fritz
is crowing with delight over a new present.
While she was on a visit to Coombe Melba
was exhibiting a case full of antique jewel-
lery and presented the visitor with an old
turnip watch that looks as if it had a steam
engine inside.
Mrs. Boyce Gibson, wife of the Univer-
sity professor, is going to improve our minds
at the Repertory Club on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 5, by expounding Rabindranath Tagore,
the Hindu poet. The fragile little lecturer
is versed in Sanskrit and studied Oriental
languages at Cambridge and Paris. She
carries her weight of learning lightly and is
an intensely domesticated little woman with
five boy children. The proceeds' of the lec-
ture go to the Reps.’ patriotic sewing-circle,
the treasurer of which is Mrs. Garran, wife
of the Solicitor-General, and once Hilda
Robson, of Sydney.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Bridletrack”: I reckon the sugar-bag has
a place on the honors list beside the bottle and
kerosene tin. Starting with the straight-out uses of
the 7Mb. bag, it makes a holdall, nosebag, apron,
combined cap and cloak for a rainy day, strainer
fpr separating honey from native beehive, firebeater
kdee-rester for a butcher’s boy, tucker-bag on
Matdda, doormat, fisherman’s bag, mailbag, floor-
cloth, saddle-cloth, Prince Albert (bush sock), and
moccasin (shearers’ footwear). Stretched round a
frame it makes a good, cool bush safe; filled with
grass or feathers it makes a pillow, and it can be
turned into use for a bush barber’s cloth. Two
sugar-bags sewn together and stretched on a frame
make a good camp stretcher, or suspended on ropes
make a hammock. Out in strips and fastened around
a piece of stick and placed in a tin of fat the
bagging makes a good wick for a slush lamp. Pilled
with dirt a number of the bags make a good
foundation for a dam or watercourse, or you can
use them as a barricade. On a frame they make
a good partition for a bush home, especially when
artistically covered with wallpaper. Five or six
sewn together make a tarpaulin or tent fly. Miners
u f e bags a S' reat deal for carrying quartz out
of shallow or small workings; whilst in the city
the good old 701 b. is the recognised measure for
marketing beans, peas, etc.
* * * .
“Aneb”: As a rejuvenator of horses’ legs
which show the effects of metal and blocks or
strained tendons, Stockholm tar stands right at the
top. Apply daily, warm, for three or four days, or
until the animal clearly shows that he’s satisfied.
Do alternate legs at the one operation, i.e., near
fore and. off hind, so that the prad can stand at
ease while the embrocation is working. Wait a
week and then start painting the off fore and near
hmd. Cut or clip the hair closely first. As an
internal remedy, too, I ask if any Abo-vet. can
recommend the tar’s equal. Dilute with equal parts
honey or treacle and apply to roots of tongue in
tablespoonful doses twice a day with a wooden
paddle. It at once relieves coughs and colds and
often pneumonia. The patients like it.
“Dead Finish” (B. 12/10/’l6),
on the natural rotation of crops, touches a subject
worth further investigation. In September, 1880,
after rain, a thin crop of wild carrots, an indigenous
plant closely resembling, in miniature, the domestic
variety, above and below ground, appeared among the
permanent grasses on the Thomson River (West Q.)
flats. None were seen again till 1886. Heavy rain
had fallen at Christmas, 1885, producing a handy
growth of Mitchell and blue grasses, but no rain
intervening the ground was bare by April. In May
good rains fell, and everywhere the grandest crop of
wild carrots imaginable flourished, but scarcely any
other grass grew till August, when Mitchell and blue
grasses came in their usual profusion. In 20 years
on or near the Thomson these were the only occa-
sions on which I noticed wild carrots, which, by the
way, are the most nutritious of Australian pastures.
* * * *
“Pick”: When Tom Muffet and the bro-
thers Walter and Harry Francis contracted to haul
an 18-ton boiler from Goulburn (N.S.W.) to the
Croker’s Mint sluicing claim on the Shoalhaven
River they strung 56 bullocks ahead of the iron-
mongery , which was loaded on a specially-built jinker
with wheels tyred 14in. wide. Even then blocks
and wire-rope tackle had to be employed to get the
load over miles of the Nadjidgomar rotten country.
Also, when Ned Tickner and his son Peter under-
took to shift an 8-ton gibber from the Windellama
marble quarry to Marulan, they displayed more bush-
man’s ingenuity and grit than did “Rag’s” Oaks Rush
navigators (B. 2/11/’l6). The Tickners had to
wallow through half a mile of bogland before they
struck solid going, and they did it with eight horses
pulling ahead of 20 bullocks. Whenever the waggon
threatened to disappear in the Nirvana of slush the
drivers lifted her again by ramming bags stuffed with
bark under the wheels, and corduroying with saplings
to give the animals a foothold.
” * * *
“Vakai”: Recently I entered a Tongan
house wherein some 20 natives were smoking Tongan
tobacco. Never again. Imagination can’t make me
feel more sorrow for the Hun-gassed Tommy than I
felt for myself. The weed is wrapped in a fibre
rope in “pricks” of four to 10 pounds, and stored
for a time, then unwound and cut off as required.
Sufficient for a smoke is dried over a hurricane-lamp
wrapped in banana-leaf, and lit. Some stenches can
be cut with a knife; an axe is necessary for this
effluvia.
* * * •
Bex”: “Lou” (B. 12/10/’l6) omitted to
state whether horse-clippers or nail scissors should
be used “to nip the heads” off mallee shoots. In
fact, she failed to mention so many things that I
suspect she is pulling our ankle. If the land is in
crop the shoots must be cut off low enough to escape
the stripper, otherwise the wheat buyer will be
docking for mallee leaves. The surest exterminator
of the curse is fire, and the only present practicable
method of burning the shoots is with the aid of
stubble. Generally speaking a running fire can be
got with an oat stubble; failing this, the fire rake
must be used. Three implements are necessary to
exterminate mallee—the plough, the slasher and
the fire-rake. And the greatest of these is the fire-
rake.
“THE LONELY SOLDIER."
AT THE SMOKE-OH.
AMERICAN VISITOR: “Say, who’s the guy blowing off all them hum gags?”
FRIEND: "Why, that’s McSnooker. He's supposed to he one of the best after-dinner
speakers we have.”
VISITOR: “Huh! P'raps he hasn't had dinner.”
“South Ors”: Charley had come down
from Nullabor Plains, and a week’s tramp through
sand > s P inifex > waterless waste and a temperature of
114 deg. had given even this nigger a Christian thirst
He reached the township
1 y & Sunday m ° rmns , and
f re WaS n ° e °* a Presently the voices,
m^n^^ed w ith the sound of a wheezy harmonium,
out of the little church. Charley crept in on
dusty feet just at the moment when the reverend
gentleman in charge was in the act of passing the
sacramental cup. Black brother knew what this act
of Christian worship meant, and promptly fell into
an attitude of devotion. The pilot hesitated and
then put the cup into Charley’s eager hands. There
was but a mouthful of wine remaining and the
black finished it with gusto. As he handed back the
empty vessel he whispered into the glory-trader’s ear
“Fill ’im up agen, boss; me plenty Christian.” ’
“E.S.S.”: In reply to “Splodger” (B.
2/11/’l6), the Darling and Murray rivers used to be
the great breeding-places of the pelican; also Bulloo
Lake and other large sheets of water farther west,
especially the lignum-lined lagoons of Western
Queensland. Its big nest of sticks and herbage is
built on sheltered shores above high-water level. The
eggs, usually two, are yellowish-white. The bird
plants its nest farther back as settlement advances.
Though never very wild it is a lover of quiet places.
The deep pouch under the oumbersome-looking bill is
a handy food-carrier when there are voracious young-
sters to feed and long distances to travel with the
dinner. Bushmen assert, too, that the bird also
carries in the pouch a supply of food and water to
sustain it on long flights. Some of those flights cover
a thousand miles, and still leave * the traveller a
flutter. When food is not very plentiful the huge
pouched-bill is used for lifting mud up from the
bottom of a lake or lagoon to the surface, where it
is strained through the beak for the purpose of ex-
tracting any animal life it may contain.
* * * *
“Huffin-Guffin”: Re “Aneb’s” query as to
using bisulphide of carbon to exterminate rabbits (B.
2/11/’l6). As much as 30 years ago we employed
carbon on Crown lands. This was the method. Fit
a plug of cotton-waste on the end of a piece of stick
two or three feet long. Pour the carbon over the
waste till it will absorb no more. Put this as far as
you can reach into the burrow and into all openings
connected or apparently connected thereto. Then well
cover the mouth of every burrow with sand, heaping
it up a foot or so, and beat well down with the back
of a shovel to block possible gas escapes. A lighted
match thrown at the mouth of one burrow after all
have been gassed, but before the final closing-up, will
produce a terrific bang, but no earth movements to
speak of. I don’t know whether bunny likes his
carbon raw or cooked; I rather think the raw stuff
was most effective. We rarely saw burrows that had
been opened from the inside. Don’t think the
weather makes much difference, only in the dry
season the sand needs careful beating down with the
shovel. Being dry then it is apt to run. P.S. —
Don’t pour carbon over your hands. It burns.
* * * *
“Beeritus” : Let me throw in a word for
the camel as a draught animal. In the north-east
of South Aus. the old style of camel-packing has
been almost entirely superseded by the collar and
hames. The collar is very like a horse’s, but
is put on with the opening underneath; hames
likewise. A team- of draught camels harnessed to
an ordinary waggon will easily pull half a ton each,
even on bad roads. Pack the same team and scwt.
each will be about their limit. The stations in the
North are entirely dependent on the “ship of the
desert” for transporting stores, etc., and it is now
rare to see the beast packed, except when in charge
of Abdul. He still sticks to the idea of his fore-
fathers, trudging along in front of a long string
of the animals with swaying packs, and the accom-
panying sore and fly-blown backs. Strange that the
white man, in spite of his comparative newness to
the game, can get more work out of a camel than
the ’Ghan, and he does not secure this result by
adopting Abdul Gunnybag’s system of a mallee rail
and a strong arm, either.

THE ROAD TO PALESTINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When through waxing dawnlight grey
Ceased the moon to beam on high,
And the lifting sun of day
Purple flushed the limpid sky,
Slow the pilgrimage began,
Like a lengthy caravan,
Heading east, in ragged line,
On the road to Palestine.
Trekked we through the wilderness,
Where the Moslem, battle rent,
Hurried east in dread distress,
Hunger weak and travel spent.
Trudging in the early morn
Down the soft and sandal-worn
Path where ancient Moses trod
At the bidding of his God.
’Twas a march of modern feet
Crunching through the yielding sand;
Never stirred by scent of sweet
Vineyards in a promised land.
Ere the white full glare of day
Camped we where the palm-trees sway,
Where the camel-keepers dwell,
By the dark seductive well.
Soared the sun enwreathed in smoke,
Trailing war-smoke dun and black,
And a low-hung cloud-wrack broke
When his furnace door swung back.
Slow the spent, unburdened horse
Dropped with hollow-eyed remorse
In the amber-spotted shade
Of a green oasis glade.
But the ruthless fire-edged blast,
Blown from burning sands at noon,
Mellows when the day is past,
Chills at peep of star or moon.
Like the wash of summer seas,
Sounds the gentle desert breeze
Through the leafy, drooping calm
Of the star-enchanted palm.
Oft the loaded rifles swayed,
Shoulder slung at dead of night;
Every trim and tempered blade
Scabbard-locked and out of sight.
Brooding clouds crept up the sky
When the escorts thundered by,
And we surged into the black
Vagueness of a formless track.
Out where heat waves madly dance,
East, the mounted troopers go,
Wide a-flank and in advance
O’er the drift hills, trekking slow.
Void of vine and flower and tree,
Song of bird and hum of bee,
Stars with double lustre shine
On the road to Palestine.

GREAT DANGER OF INSECT BITES.
Protect Yourself Against Ordinary
Dangers by Using NEV-A-BITE.
A Preparation of Proved Effectiveness.
“There is no question,” says a leading specialist,
“that insect bites may lead to great danger to
health, and have been known to end fatally.”
The dread Mosquito,
whose bite is perhaps
the most dangerous of
all insects.
This alarming
statement, which
has appeared in
the influential
newspapers of this
country, should
arouse the public
to the fact that
bites from mos-
quitoes and other
insects are things
to worry about.
It is quite pos-
sible that if one’s
blood is in a poor
state an insect bite
might set up such
serious inflamma-
tion as to cause blood-poisoning, and—as every-
one well knows —blood-poisoning may lead to
even the amputation of a limb.
The best form of treatment of mosquito
bites is prophylactic or preventive. The appli-
cation of a i little of the NEV-A-BITE
lotion reduces the probability of mosquito bites
to a minimum.
NEV-A-BITE is a perfectly harmless
preparation, and serves to whiten, soften and
beautify the skin.
if NEV-A-BITE is unobtainable from
your local supplier, send 1/2 in stamps to one
of the following, viz:—
Duerdin & Sainsbury, Flinders Lane, Melbourne.

“A contented mind is a continual feast”—you get
both when you drink Martell’s Brandy. There are
no better judges than Britons, and they decide in
favor of Martell’s every time. From George I. to
George V. Martell’s has been supreme—not only the
favorite in England but in France as well. It is
superior for social purposes, and being rich in the
higher ethers is also unequalled in cases of sick-
ness.

Recipe to Darken Grey Hair
This Home-made Mixture Darkens Grey
Hair and Relieves Dandruff.
To a half-pint of water add: —
Bay Rum loz.
Orlex Compound a small box
These are all simple ingredients that you
can buy from any chemist at very little cost,
and mix them yourself. Apply to the scalp
once a day for two weeks, then once every
other week until all the mixture is used.
A half-pint should be enough to darken
the grey hair and relieve dandruff. It does
not stain the scalp, is not sticky or greasy
and does not rub off. It promotes the
growth of the hair and makes harsh hair
soft and glossy.— Advt. [4

“Ses”: Most parrots are content with the
primitive unlined spout for a nest. These are as
easy to find as magpies’ nests, for the parrot is a
fool bird that gives itself away all the time. When
the nest is in a green hollow the parent birds chip
the bark off around the entrance, a habit common
to nearly the whole family, from the large cockatoos
down to the little greenleeks, and thus advertise their
domicile as clearly as if they hung a brass plate on
the front door. Further, the everlasting squawk of
the young ones locates the nursery. Almost any
small hollow suits the parrot, whether it be at the
top of a lofty gum, near the root of a small box or
gidya or in a rock. An exception is the ground
parrakeet. It frequents scrubby country, heath
lands and swampy flats. Its dress is a beautiful
green and black richly flecked with yellow, with a
long, speckled green and yellow tail. Shy and wary,
the owner is seldom seen until flushed from the rank
grass, though dogs easily find it by its strong scent. Its
flight is low and undulating. It and the myrlumbing
(night or spinifex parrot) are the only parrots to
construct a nest —a hole under a tussock, or among
tufts of rushes, well lined with grass: a deep and
rather neat repository for three or four oblong, white
eggs. The flesh is excellent, quite equal to
that of snipe or quail. The lovable little creature
has always had a hard time. Blacks levied a heavy
toll on it by robbing its nests, and besides nosing
dogs, native cats and browsing stock, the ever-ready
gun has made its feeble twitter a rare sound in its
native haunts. Now with the spread of the hated fox
its lot is a sadly precarious one.

“Glendower”: Can any Abo-liar trot up a
clan with such a choice assortment of handles as
the Kellys own? Here are a few that I have been
introduced to while swinging the banjo up in N.Q.:
Kelly the Rake, Kelly the Rager, Cast-iron Kelly,
Broken-nosed Kelly, Kelly the Hum, Dog-faced
Kelly, Trooper Kelly and Rhinoceros Kelly—who has
the reputation of being able to kick up more row
than any six other Kellys combined. I heard him
once, and he didn’t injure his reputation in the
least. The occasion was when a mate became a
little too familiar, and had the temerity to address
him with his handle abbreviated. I have recollections,
also, of a bloque called Motor-car Kelly, but as he
appears to have lost his honk I will let him R.I.P.
* * * *
“Pick”: Don’t waste time waiting for a
kangaroo to jump 31ft. on the level, because the
hopper to do it hasn’t been built. At Windellama
(N.S.W.) I once saw a full-grown grey flier, admit-
tedly the fastest of the local ’roo tribe, pursued
by a noted galloper among kangaroo-dogs of his
day. The race was along a level road for half a
mile, and the flier won, after a most desperate burst,
by clearing the fence into an orchard. Subsequent
measurement showed the jumps to be 27ft. with
undeviating regularity.
“Waipa”: At the time of the Maori war,
in the Waikato district, army transport was all
done by horse, and there were an awful number
of jibbers, chiefly through incompetent or drunken
drivers. Mick Hogan, a road contractor living near
Otahuhu, bought all those jibs, and this is how he
dealt with them. He had a paddock with a steep
declivity running across it. Taking a pupil to the
top Michael would harness him to the skeleton of
a bullock dray. All jibs will back a little, and
when the one in hand backed to the brow of the
hill Hogan let go. Holy wars! away went the
whole shandrahan, whirling down the incline, with
a rattle you could have heard in the next shire,
head over tail, tail over head all the way. It’s
strange, but not two in ten horses would display
a scratch on arrival at the bottom, and not more
than three in ten ever required a second lesson. A
cute N.C.O. tumbled to the business and after an
interview with Mick the jibs greatly increased along
the line. Many of them were afterwards sold in
the Sydney market at from 60 to 80 guineas each,
and if the M.L. scrap had lasted half as long as the
Kaiser’s Hogan could have bought out Anthony
Hordern.
* * * *
“Yarrum”: Somebody asks the greatest
distance ridden on horseback in a day; and here
is my contribution. I rode from Umaralla, 15
miles the Queanbeyan side of Cooma, to Bega—99
miles—in much under 24 hours. I started at six
o’clock in the morning and reached the Bank Hotel,
Bega, at 11.30 p.m. Got off only once—at Nimity-
belle, for dinner—and when I told publican
Jimmie Kiss, a man who knew a heap about
horses, that I was going right through that day,
he said I’d never get there. He advised me to put
up at Numbugga (Garfield) for the night, but as
the mount was fresh at Tantawanglo I chanced it.
It was a tough journey; but in those days horses
were bred for endurance. Black Tommy was
the name of my horse, and he was well known at
Wollongong, where my brother reared him from
Denmark and a Sir Charles mare.
* * * #
“Try Fluke”: My Urewera bush-acquaint-
ance, Eria Rankura, gives me a recipe for gunshot
wounds. Whenever you are plugged, just reach out
for a supplejack vine, char the end in the fire and
with it cauterise the bullethole good and hard. Then
plug up with clay and fill your pipe and trust
in the Atua. The supplejack cauteriser usually did
the trick in bad flesh-wounds in the war days, says
Eria, but it was advisable to keep the prayers going
regularly for fear the Atua might turn rusty.
Another medicine-man, a Taranaki Maori, once
told me that the boiled juice of the mucilaginous
roots of the flax-bush was the best thing out for
gunshot wounds and bayonet jabs. And in his day
the big Enfield bullets made a considerable mess
when they arrived.
" OVER THE WINE.
THE L AW: “Potiphar’s wife? Well, I’ve always had my doubts about her true char-
acter.”
THE CHURCH: “ Doubts , my dear s ir! The narrative leaves no doubt whatever.”
THE LAW : “Quite so. But I must say I’d like to have heard Joseph’s evidence under
cross-examination.”
“Dead Finish”: Some of the many aliases
the bush-worker has for treacle: Cocky’s joy, bul-
locky’s delight, scrub-cutter’s agony, jackeroo’s night-
mare, rabbiter's friend, boundary rider’s stand-by,
rouseabout’s horror and C.S.R.
THE WORRIES OF MARRIED LIFE.
THE ANGRY YOUNGSTER: “ It’s no good — a, woman always manages to get what she
wants!”
THE CYNICAL OLDSTER: “What worries me is that as soon as she gets it she wants
something else.”
“Hay”: I have followed and captured kan-
garoos in various ways, and often went to the
trouble of measuring their strides. When hard
pressed about 19ft, is a fair average of the
length of the leaps. When closely pursued by
dogs the kanga’s gait looks more like running
than bounding - , as he doesn’t rise very high off the
ground. The pace then is wonderfully fast. I saw
a full-grown ’roo hunted by dogs dash straight at
a newly-erected five-wire sheep fence. He threw
himself against the tightly-strained wires with a
terrific crash. All five wires were broken and a post
lifted clean out of the ground into which it had
been planted 2ft. Except for a few muscular quivers
poor ’roo never moved again. Once I amused myself
watching the antics of a half-grown ’roo. The
animal was playfully leaping from side to side,
varying the performance by bounding high in the
air. I believe when at play a flier can leap as many
feet upward as it can over level ground.
* * * *
“McNorth” : I have found the ammonia
prescription for the sting of the blue-bottle, or jelly-
fish, or Portuguese man-o’-war, or whatever the float-
ing blue horror is called, of little use here in Torres
Strait. Perhaps we hfre a more poisonous variety.
After rubbing the tentacles off with sand, the appli-
cation of a towel wrung out in boiling water will
give relief. But the marks remain for life, which
illustrates the virulency of the acid, or whatever it
is, that is secreted by the tentacles. In these late
months of the year the waters of the western side
of Cape York become infested with the stinging
blue devils. It’s quite common to get a couple of
hundred of them in one haul of a 50-fathom drag-
net. There appear to be two varieties, almost iden-
tical in appearance; but while one can give its
victim a realistic taste of the things Dante pictured
in his Inferno, the other is quite harmless.
“Barcoo”: “The Hum’s” horses that have
been chewing the bark off his trees evidently
sojourn in a sour coastal area, where, after the
passing of winter, the animals are liable to suffer
from intestinal worms. So they have gone to their
own chemist’s shop for a supply of tannin, to clear
up the vermin..
* * * *
“Alidon” : There is a variation of the gun-
bursting feat much more artistic than the crude
methods described by recent Abfe. correspondents. Let
thenr try this. Load the rifle, and, holding it perpen-
dicularly, place a penny flat upon the muzzle. Then
press the trigger, and watch the coin and your head
being blown off simultaneously. The less-than-
momentary check caused to the air in the barrel will
scatter the steel to shreds.
* * * *
“Tiaki”: There are some very hollow
places in Maoriland. At Kereru station the people
lately heard dreadful rumblings from the stomach
of the overtaxed country. Horses and cattle acted as
if under the influence of mal de mer, running about
moaning and roaring in terror. I lived up in that
country (inland from Napier), and about the back
of Owhaoko station, towards the rear of the Kai-
manawa mountains, there are holes in the ground
that would hide all the sins of the Kaiser and the
National Debt into the bargain. Boulders rolled
down them grumbled and rumbled for fully half
a minute, and long after they seemed to have
reached the roof of I-lell they could be faintly heard
doing fresh leaps at a depth calculated to make a
man draw back and shudder. One explanation is
that they are volcanoes or fumaroles which died in
their infancy. I don’t like them.
* * * *
“Pick”: In warm, damp seasons thickly-
grassed meadows are affected with the red rust
nark-. I have seen clouds of the rust spores rising
into the air behind South Coast (N.S.W.) dairy herds
as they were being chased to the bails. Somebody
suggested a couple of seasons’ rest from wheat-
growing in Australia to allow the rust to die out.
There will be something doing when he further advo-
cates a secession from grass-growing by the cow
cookies.
* * * *
“Wee Mac”: How is this for a horse’s
endurance? A few weeks ago a crippled nag was
found inside the railway fence about a mile on the
Stanthorpe side of Dalveen (Q.). It had evidently
been injured by a train during the night. The two
hind feet were severed at the fetlocks, and, although
it’s most incredible, the poor beast was walking
about on the stumps.

“HEARNE’S”
Dear Bulletin,. — Re “Damaged Goods”
or “Damned Bads” or whatever it is. I
met with a “romance” in the long ago, out
back, in the same line. As follows: Only
son of wealthy pub-keeper contracted syph.,
unknown to himself. He consulted me. He
was riddled with “secondaries.” I told him.
He was shocked, and very properly brought
his young woman (the laundress at the
pub) for examination. She was ditto.
Father got to know —how I can’t say. He
sacked the laundress. Her folks found out.
They turned her out of doors. Then the
only son did —what? He was a man. He
married her. Then his folks kicked him
out and he went bushwhacking. Meanwhile
both were under as vigorous a treatment as
existed a quarter of a century ago, with
very good results. Next she came to
to engage me to attend her impending con-
finement. Treatment pushed. Child born,
with all the stigmata of congenital syphilis.
It looked like a diseased monkey. Child
put under treatment. Exit me—left district.
Successor warned about the cases and treat-
ment continued. Eater enter me—as locum
tenens. Scene: Billiard-room in father’s
pub. Curtain rises, discovering locum play-
ing 100 up with the policeman. Man sitting
on form with strapping two-year-old on his
knee. Locum: “Hello. That’s a fine kid!
Yours?” Man: “Yairs! You ought to
know!” Locum: “How so?” Man: “You
brought it into the world.” Locum: “Very
likely. Can’t remember.” Man : “Don’t you
remember me?” Locum: “No.” Man:
“Why, I’m !” (the only son). Locum:
“Good God! And how’s your wife?” Man:
“We’re all as fit as fiddles. Never had a
day’s illness —since. And we’re back with
the old man.” Tableau and curtain. —Yrs.,
Dr. Nil. (P.S. —No rights reserved.)
“E.D.”: Melbourne Bijou revisited. I was
long ago driven from this little house, affec-
tionately regarded as a storeroom of pleasant
memories, by an abominable outbreak of
mirror. The place was literally walled with
the outrages. I find they have been torn
out, and the Bijou is almost itself again.
One thing to be grateful for is the preserva-
tion of the old frieze above the proscenium,
the finest bit of mural decoration in Mel-
bourne, so far as my knowledge goes. It
represents all the arts of the theatre bring-
ing their gifts to Minerva for judgment, and
must be visual to all old Vic. theatregoers by
the simple process of shutting the eyes. The
same frieze decorated the original Bijou, and
came unscathed through the fire that de-
stroyed the theatre 20-odd years ago. It has
escaped an inrush of water and other vicis-
situdes and the wear and tear of time, and
is now rather better than new, age having
mellowed its quality while investing it with
the reverence due to an ancient instigation.
Unfortunately it was no luck-bringer. It
has looked down upon many a frost.
Manly, more power to it, means to hold
its annual carnival as usual next year. Why
not? There’s a hungry cottage hospital to
be fed and a motor-ambulance to be bought
Secretary Mann gives January 10-13 as the
dates of the money-spinner.
“Glen H.”: That popular shriek of Bland-
olt days, “Women and Wine,” known to the
irreverent as “Flossie and Fizz,” is being
successfully revived in darkest London. Ethel
Warwick is playing the Most Horrible
Female in Paris —the one the Theatre Royal
programme was wont to refer to as “The
Woman With the Geological Heart,” or
words to that effect
Marie Lohr has made good in the Ameri-
can light comedy “Her Husband’s Wife,”
produced by Dot Boucicault at the London
New Theatre. Archer, of the Stab, says
she “has done nothing so good as her Irene
Randolph.” This Irene fancies she is going
to die, so sets about selecting a second
wife for her husband, her choice falling
upon a dowdy and not particularly juvenile
friend. The latter promptly dissipates the
dowdiness and transforms herself into a
very smart and attractive person who fasci-
nates the husband. Whereupon Irene, of
course, gets furiously jealous and decides
not to die.
“Norbell”: The film was “John Halifax,
Gentleman,” and when the flood waters
swamped the tannery the unimaginative
female at the piano broke loose with “A
Hundred Fathoms Deep.” Later, when
John Halifax heroically climbed a ladder
and rescued a cripple, the lady obliged with
“Up I Came with My Little Lot.” But she
really made a hit when the starving rioters
set fire to the Quaker’s mill. The incen-
diaries did their I.W.W. job to the stirring
strains of “Keep the Home Fires Burning.”
About six years ago a wild but harmless
English enthusiast named Westlake over-
ran Tasmania seeking information about
the vanished Black Brother of those parts.
He collected one ton of stones, alleged to
be aboriginal weapons and tools, though lots
of them didn’t look like it, and two tons
on information, and was going
the one and only real book about the xas
manian blacks and setae where they came
from and who they were. But he touna
his mass of material so heavy and he had
to track down so many side issues that
at latest advices the book was hanging •
When last heard from Westlake had a
theory that he had discovered the diary
and private papers of G. A. Robinson, the
man who brought in the last of
manian aborigines and afterwards looke
after them when they were cooped up on
Flinders Island. Robinson ought to have
known more about the blacks than any-
body, but his published remarks concerning
them are bald and uninteresting.
Out of a total of 2000 who have passed
through Launceston Grammar School
(Tas.) 370 are now on active service. As
the school dates from ’46, very many of
the 2000 are over the age limit. Among
the ones to win distinction are Frank
Thornthwaite (D. 5.0.), Brab Hallowes
(French Military Medal), Lex Evans and
John Webster (Military Cross). Word has
just come through that Raymond Sherwin
has also annexed a Military Cross and
received a letter of congratulation tioin
General Birdwood for taking charge at
Pozieres when all his superior officers haa
been casualtied. Before the war R ie ut.
Sherwin was a keen sport and shone m tne
lacrosse field. He is a cousin of songstress
Amy.
Byron Moore, of the V.R.C., has literary
leanings, sometimes indulges himself in
rhymes, and is understood to have a book ot
reminiscences in hand. It should be an in
structive human document. If the V.K..L.
secretary confined himself to his racing
experiences he could turn out a. volume with
the capacity of a bath tub, with an item ot
interest on- every page. A sample yarn from
this Spring Meeting tells of the newly-dis-
covered wife of a State official who waylaid
Byron Moore on the lawn on Cup Day in an
indignant mood, and wanted to know about
added weight in the case of Shepherd King.
“You’ve put a lot of weight on him, _ said
the lady, with the air of one exposing a
great public wrong, “to prevent him winning,
I suppose. Why wasn’t I told of that be-
fore I risked my half-sovereign?”
The natural history of Flanders: —
In our quiet sector, where the trenches are nearly
two years old, and where the only visiting from
either side is done by us in occasional raids on
Fritz’s front line, the rats have full possession. Not
even a gas attack will dislodge them. It is a serious
crime for a soldier to lose his “iron rations”——tin
of “bully” and broken-up biscuits, usually carried
in the haversack. The morning after we took over
this ground, all biscuits were missing, and many
were the holes in haversacks. Now we are waiting
to see if all will be crimed for the losses. The
little beasts have no respect for tired and sleeping
soldiers. A pair will get together and settle a
conscription argument on a sleeper’s chest. One
nibbled off a portion of a private’s ear. Another
whose luck was rotten was observed at daylight on
the parapet; he had stopped a Fritz bullet through
the night. Many now are the snares and contri-
vances set to catch a rat, and, incidentally, when no
officer is about, many are the Mark VII. bullets that
chase the wily devils to their holes.
“Sere”: I have just read the lament of
“W.H.R.,” who tells (B. 27/7/’l6) of the“care-
less loss of two Stokes mortars, which the
Huns captured during a night raid.” On the
night the mortars were lost the Huns sub-
jected this particular lot to a whirlwind
bombardment, which smashed the breast-
work (there are no trenches in this locality)
to smithereens. The bombardment was so
sudden and heavy that the crew of the guns
had very little chance of getting their
weapons away. The general belief is that
the mortars were buried yards deep in the
battered breastwork, and that the enemy
did not even see them. I have seen Billjim
infantrymen buried in these breastworks or
barricades, and their bodies have never
been recovered. At any rate if the Hun
did discover the secret of the Stokes, he
hasn’t thrown any back at us yet, which is
about the best possible proof that he scored
a clean miss.
Angelina is about to bid a long farewell
to her barber-pole and tiger-striped boots.
Apart from the fact that shoes are usually
worn in summer-time for comfort, the long,
loud boot is to be discarded because the
world’s dress-designers have decided the
matter. Angy’s legs are to go into early re-
tirement because ankle-length skirts are to
be the correct wear, with no “fancy” boot-
tops visible. In future Angelina will only
put on her swankish “gabardines,” done in
grey and scarlet and old gold, when she is
helping mummer with the washing-up. Con-
sidering the prices charged for this class of
frill, Angy’s papa will give three cheers when
he hears the news.
The fissure in the Federal Labor party led
to at least one diverting scene. The other
day one young member, who had clung to
Hughes and had been rewarded for _ his
tenacity with an official position, determined
to celebrate his rise from obscurity by
annexing the special apartment of a Tudor
follower. So one morning the young man
invaded the room, heavily armed with docu-
ments, books of great learning and other
signs of his sudden political growth, and
got everything nice and comfortable for a
long stay. While he was absent on some
mission or other, the real tenant turned up,
and as his figure is plentiful and his manner
pugnacious, the neighborhood somehow felt
that there would be something doing. Sure
enough the door of his sanctum had hardly
closed upon him when there was a noise
like a rogue elephant in disagreement with a
house-full of furniture. The suspicion that
he was upset about something was confirmed
by the rapid opening of the door and the
ejection of the intruder’s property. Papers
and books flew out in vicious haste, and quan-
tities of language hurried after. When the
chucker-out had cooled down and departed,
the cause of the mischief returned, gathered
up his scattered belongings, and without a
word stole away to the coalhole or some-
where to nurse the affront And all the
feather-dusters chortled. A youngster who
gets bumptious on a small dose of authority
deserves a chastening.

In accents of soft melody,
The secret none should know.
Then broke from ’neath a dreaming tree
The voice of Romeo.
Fair Juliet in terror sped,
In fear stole back again
To hear what Romeo had said.
Then sighed and sang the twain;
And Juliet twice vanished,
And twice she would remain.
Then as he moaned, a brick or so
Took him an awful bat,
And up the wall I saw him go,
His poor ribs beaten flat,
My very finest Romeo,
My midnight Thomas cat.
VICTORIA.
S.S.
Business, Bobbery, etc.
Another Victorian farmer, Henry Davies,
of Lake Boga, is making an experiment in
rice-growing. Along the Murray, up Swan
Hill way, there is a good deal of swamp-
land which has been more or less reclaimed
and is used for general agricultural purposes
when conditions permit. Davies is putting
five acres of this land under rice, and hopes
to get something out of it which he wouldn’t
get, in the present state of the soil, if he
planted the usual crops. So far no enthusi-
asm has been shown by the Department of
Agriculture, though the success of the ex-
periment will be another step towards
making this country self-contained.

“Y.Z.”: My butcher insists that this war
has planted a horror of sausages in the Aus-
tralian breast. “Where we had 20 orders
for ’em two years ago,” he says, “we haven’t
seven now, and it’s much the same in all
the shops I know of. No, it’s not the natural
outcome of the scarcity of beef and mutton;
it is an established prejudice based on the
belief that the sausage is of enemy origin.
Mention sausages in your little list to a
housewife these mornings, and 10 to one she
snorts and asks if you take her for a
German.”
“Spanner”: “R.A.Y.” (B. 2/11/’l6) was
wasting his time when he expressed pity for
the inefficiency of machinery salesmen, their
employers and their customers. The old
cocky is kept alive to machinery improve-
ments by the travellers, who are always pre-
pared to back up their “mendacious loqua-
city” by field trials. That manufacturers
know their business is proved by their
success. But there is a type of mahogany-
headed cocky who drifts on to the land, full
of theory and imagined mechanical know-
ledge. He is the Johnnie-know-all who piles
up useless cultivators and harvesters. That s
nobody’s fault; for you can’t separate a fool
from his folly.

“N. or M.”: The kelp that fringes Maria
Island, Bass Strait, and is to be harvested
for potash and iodine, if it is not wanted to
keep the sun off the rock-cod, has historic
interest. Peron, the French naturalist who
visited the place in ISO 2 on the Naturaliste,
commented on the “enormous beds of Fucus
giganticus, several plants being not less than
250 ft. to 300 ft. long.” Smith O’Brien, the
Irish exile, got badly tangled up in it when
trying to escape from the island in ’5l. John
Mitchel gives a vivid description of the inci-
dent in his “Jail Journal.” The “escape”
was a farce. The chartering of the schooner,
by friends in Hobart, to lie off the coast and
pick up O’Brien, gave the show away, and
the prisoner was removed to Port Arthur. It
was one Bernacchi who cast a speculative eye
on the huge bull-kelp and proposed tanning it
for shoe-leather. That was something like an
idea. The Southport experiment in potash is
a tame thing beside it.
• • * *
“Fait Lux”: A letter has been returned
through the dead-letter office to the W.A.
Taxation Department with this inscription:
“Undelivered. Left for Berlin; last heard
of in France.”
* * * *
“N. E. Bones” : The bottle-oh and the haw-
ker, in the eyes of the average householder,
occupy much the same privileged position;
but it isn’t so in fact. The bottle-oh must
be an honest man in the eyes of the law,
since—in Victoria at any rate —a record
even of seven days’ gaol stops, him from
getting his license. The mere objection of a
John Hop at the licensing court is enough to
block Bill Bottle-oh and no questions asked.
But no Government license is issued to the
hawker. If a barrowman wishes to cart
cabbages around in a suburb such as Prahran,
where there is a municipal market, all he
has to do is to get his cart and cabbages and
pay his market-dues to the local municipal
authorities, who take his money and pass him
out without troubling to inquire . into _ his
morals; and in marketless municipalities
even this little formality is dispensed with.
There a man just out of a seven-years’ stretch
may snoop around the backyards, cabbage in
hand, without molestation by the police. His
cabbage is his complete justification. Gov-
ernment licensing of hawkers would j largely
reduce their number by weeding out the
numerous time-servers in the profession; but
the fact that it would decrease the number of
petty thefts and put a bunch of undesirables
to work doesn’t seem to count for much when
a loss to municipal finances is concerned.
THE PARSON'S PRESENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A parson once, by all admired,
Received, of high esteem the sign,
From those his goodness thus inspired,
A present of a cask of wine.
But lo! when soon he came to draw,
A miracle, in mode as rapid
But quite unlike what Cana saw,
Had changed his wine to water vapid t
The parson never knew the cause,
For miracles are things of mystery,
Though some, like this, have had their laws
Explained by facts of private history.
Those whom his lore did aptly teach,
Wished all to share the gracious task,
So planned to bring a bottle each
And pour the wine in one huge cask.
Now one, by chance, thought: “None will know,
And, with the wine of all my brothers,
One pint of water well may go.”
And so, by chance, thought all the others I

Stop! Look! Listen!
Too many cars are equipped with a weak,
little buzzer that can only be heard a

the faintness of a poor, inefficient, weak
signal.
Safety first! Use a Stewart Warning
Signal for your own protection.
Its note is clear, loud and penetrating —it
makes everyone stop, look and listen.
Just touch it with elbow, arm or hand and
it instantly commands immediate atten-
tion. .

should, whenever possible, avoid eating
food that is acid in its nature or which by
chemical action in the stomach develops
acidity. Unfortunately, such a rule elim-
inates most foods which are pleasant to the
taste as well as those which are rich in
blood, flesh and nerve-building properties.
This is the reason why dyspeptics and
stomach sufferers are usually so thin, emaci-
ated and lacking in that vital energy which
can only come from a well-fed body. For
the benefit of those sufferers who have been
obliged to exclude from their diet all starchy,
sweet or fatty food and are trying to keep
up a miserable existence on gluten products,
I would suggest that you should try a meal
of any food or foods which you may like in
moderate amount, taking immediately after-
wards half a teaspoonful of bisurated mag-
nesia in a little hot or cold water. This will
neutralise any acid which may be present, or
which may be formed, and instead of the
usual feeling of uneasiness and fullness, you
will find that your food agrees with you per-
fectly. Bisurated magnesia is doubtless the
best food-corrective and antacid known. It
is not a medicine, and has no direct action
on the stomach ; but by neutralising the acid-
ity of the food contents, and thus removing
the source of the acid irritation which in-
flames the delicate stomach lining, it does
more than could possibly be done by any
drug or medicine. As a physician I believe
in the use of medicine whenever necessary,
but I must admit that I cannot see the sense
of dosing an inflamed and irritated stomach
with drugs instead of getting rid of the acid
—the cause of all the trouble. Get a little
bisurated magnesia from your chemist, eat
what you want at your next meal, take some
of the bisurated magnesia as directed above,
and see if I’m not right.— Advt.
POLITICAL
POINTS
There is talk of another big loan for
Australia. Still in the hands of the
Jhughes!
The Bulletin was wrong. Besides rob-
bing the conscription party of tens of thou-
sands of votes and seriously prejudicing the
Defence Act, Hughes’s tragic blunder in
calling up Class 1 before the Referendum
was held cost the country, not nearly a
million, but over a million. The camps
alone ran away with £600,000; a couple of
hundred thousand men were non-productive
for a month, which means a loss of £500,000
or thereabouts; and thousands of others who
were passed out or exempted lost from one
to three days. One way and another Hughes
is proving a rather expensive “statesman.”
Durack, the temporary leader of the rem-
nant of the N. 8. Wales Labor party, has
been elected permanently to the position over
John Storey, the stop-gap chairman during
the embroglio with the last P.L.L. conference.
Even in politics possession may thus be
taken as nine points of the law. Storey
preferred to stay out of the band altogether
rather than work a second fiddle. So the
deputy-leadership goes to James Dooley, the
Lithgow miners’ representative. Dooley is
one of the little baud of thrashers who,
within party ranks, kept the former Holman
Government diving for its life.
It would just about crystallise the situation
if “the public recognition of Mr. Gregory
Wade’s great services” was solemnised at
the Town Hall by Premier Holman present-
ing his friend, amidst tumultuous applause,
with a frozen schnapper.
A FELLOW FEELING.
INDIGNANT SUBSCRIBER: “What the devil
do you mean by printing the birth of
my tenth kid under 24 Distressing
Occurrence’?”
COUNTRY EDITOR: “ ’Struth, that must
’ave been that foreman again! He’s a
married man himself!”
The so-called National Government in N.
S. Wales didn’t have to wait long to see
somebody following its bad precedent. The
week after it had refused to appeal to the
ballot, preferring to disfranchise the electors
for 12 months, the coal-miners said, “That’s
good enough for us!” and turned down the
ballot, too. Even the hardy old S. M.
Herald had to pull a wry face as it con-
demned them so soon after approving the
same tactics in its new political friends.
Minister for Education James says that
the N. S. Wales Education system must be
expanded. Of course. But The Bulletin
would urge on James to start at the right
end. In a place where most of the men
have voted to quit, every encouragement
should be given the able-bodied youth who
aspires to take on plain sewing.
Municipal ownership of public utilities
is liable to begin well, at any rate. In the
six months it has been run-
ning, the Melbourne-Burwood
tram has earned £22,095.
Working expenses came to
£16,616, and £2474 was appro-
priated for renewals, main-
tenance and sinking fund,
leaving £3005 to be divided
among the four proprietary
councils, Richmond getting
£1053, Hawthorn £9lB, Mel-
bourne City £737 and Camber-
well £297.
The coal-miners did not go
on general strike till Novem-
ber ; consequently September
was not a strike month—at
least, no more of a strike
month than usual. Yet, dur-
ing that month, 6506 N. S.
Wales miners were out at one
time or another and the total
lost days were 34,145. or, say,
5| days per man. And that
was a mere shower in the
fall of tools. Altogether, in
this one State, 14,173 workers
took 80,382 holidays and lost
something over £40,000 in pay. But
it doesn’t matter. Isn’t there a beautiful
war raging to make everybody jolly and fat?
Before it is too late, an emphatic protest
ought to be made against the proposal to
float Australian loans in N’York. Apart
from the general impropriety of adding to
our so-called public works debt at a time
when we are unavoidably piling up war debt,
to borrow from the U.S.A. will give that
nation a status inside Australia, with the
result that when our new really Protective
tariff comes before Parliament we shall
almost inevitably find Yankee dumpers busy
in the lobbies, using the Yankee loan as a
lever. There is also the point that, if we
get into debt to a foreign Power, we shall
have to risk the complications that have hit
China, where the foreigner put himself by
force into the Custom House.
The Scaddan Government commenced oper-
ations with a credit legacy of £13,299. and
the rest of the story of splodge, expressed
in terms of deficit, went this way:—
1912 .. .. £134,409
1913 .. .. 190,404
1914 .. .. 135,411
1915 . . . . 365,617
1916 .. .. 441,295
During the same period the public debt was
pushed up by nearly 15 millions and pay-
ments to the sinking-fund were made with
lOU’s. The net result is to send the new
Government hunting round for tuppences
and reduce the State to the condition of a
Domain dosser who has pawned his pants
for beer. Meanwhile, of course, we must be
on the alert against the Germans.
.The Victorian anti-Sosh farmer finds him-
self with a new appetite. He wants to try
another kind of Socialistic stimulant
and won’t be happy till he gets it.
Wheat-sacks to hold a mere three
bushels are on the verge of lOd. apiece;
wherefore the agriculturist has been
earnestly imploring Hagelthorn to go
the whole hog. import bags in bulk,
do the distributing, and thus “save the
farmers from extortion.” It is an
interesting spectacle, this of Anti-
Sosh pursuing the shy Socialistic ani-
mal across country, reaching out to
pat him with a gentle hand and roar-
ing : “Good tiger ! Good feller !” But
why can’t these farmers, be their own
tiger? There is nothing on earth to
stop them from forming co-operative
cos. and being their own importers or
manufacturers not only of bags but
of a dozen other things. Sosh has
not made such a success of things lately
that the farmers can be excused for waiting
for him to move.
In the last 10 years the deaths of little
Australians under 12 .months varied from
8163 to 10,963 per annum : and those figures
are larger than the death-roll of Australian
soldiers in this war. Yet they take no count
of deaths between one year and seven. That
half the awful loss is due to overcrowding,
bad housing, improper and insufficient feed
ing, and general ignorance is shown by the
fact that, whereas in the poor, crowded Mel-
bourne suburbs of Richmond, Fitzroy and
Port Melbourne the under-12-months death-
rate was 11.37 per 100 births, in compara-
tively spacious Kew, Malvern and Camber-
well it was only 5.39 per 100. The war
losses are bad enough, but they can’t be
helped; our baby losses would more than 5
recoup them if we could dissipate ignorance
and cut the claws of greed.
So far as The Bulletin is able to
diagnose his condition, Holman wants o pn
as the Amended Bill.
With the approval of the Public Works
Committee, it is proposed to repeat t e oo
ishness of putting things in the wrong place
by building a new Government pnnte
the water's-edge at Circular Quay, Sy J;
Already shipping cos. have asked H •

from oversea, as they do in London and
other big ports, and when the Trust takes
that job on it will want all the little water-
side space there is. Wherefore when the
painters are putting the final touches on a
building that has no need of a water-
frontage, the knackers will probably arrive
to make room for shipping requirements.
That sort of thing has happened in Sydney
before, and there is very little profit in it.
Now the future holds out black
threats of an unlighted coast and
30 vessels wrecked in a night over
a question affecting Bill’s dirt
money or the pay for girls in a
jam factory. For the lighthouse-
keepers of Australia have joined a
union of Customs Department em-
ployees, and they expect to get a
case into the Arbitration Court
next year. Heaven only knows,
but they may yet insist on the
abolition of night work.
Of the N. S. Wales politicians
whom the P.L.L. has been declar-
ing bogus, several have been in
trouble with the organisation
before, and therefore probably have
hopes now. In ’94 J. B. Nicholson
refused to sign the solidarity
pledge and ran without endorse-
ment. Alf Edden also ran as an
Independent. In the same election
Hoyle opposed and was beaten by
McGowen. ’Arry was then a
Dibbs follower and the gate of the
Labor fold wasn’t opened for him until 10
years later. And Meagher only threw in
his lot with the party when he smelt some-
thing cooking.
Poor old .Cocky is going to have a dry
autumn. Last year the Wheat Pool ad-
vanced him 3s. a bushel (less 6d. exes.) for
a start. This year he is to get half a
crown; but the first payment, to be financed
by the Commonwealth Bank, will not run to
more than Is. 6d. ; and there won’t be much
left towards the store bill after he has met
his harvest exes, and his bag and fertiliser
bills. Yet there are still some farmers who
reckon they don’t want Protection and new
industries to consume wheat. They like
their market 10.000 miles away, with a few
hostile submarines in between.
“O. Blin” congratulates his friend :
Senator Ted Russell remains true to himself. Ten
or more years ago I knew him as a young and fervid
Socialist and a valiant in General Tom Mann’s army.
Later on, Teddy found that Sosh was productive of
voice-strain and ostracism, and started becoming
respectable. Wherefore as a prim Laborite he made
a vociferous attempt to reach the P’ran seat in the
Vic. Assembly. Subsequently, hoisted into the Senate,
he revealed more of the valuable quality of adapting
himself to the color of his environment. I felt he had
wronged himself when, later on, he promised to
enlist and resigned from the Hughes Cabinet as a
protest against the Prime Minister’s infamous
attempt to interfere with the Referendum ballot. It
almost seemed as if in his sacrifice he had over-
looked his guiding principle. But the absence of
his name from the recruiting lists and his acceptance
of a post from the man whom he had repudiated
convinces me that Teddy is still himself.
The Little Boy from Manly hopes that
some abler pen will take the matter up:—
Dear Bullet e bn, —That was a nasty one Lord
Northcliffe got off on the British Cabinet the other
day, when they wanted to give him the job of Food
Dictator. “Not me,” he says, “you can get someone
else for your Tucker Tribunal. I’ve been getting to
press on time and catching the trains for the past
20 years, and I can’t afford to join a push of 22
procrastinators who are always too late. My reputa-
tion wouldn’t stand it,” he says. “For me the
time was never yet unripe. Why wait and see?”
he says. “No great journalist ever does that. Be
punctual, and you will bang your belltoppers on
the hatrack of victory. Wait and see, and you will
be gathering fungus in the backyard of eternity.”
And his words found an echo in the sinking heart
of poor old King of Roumania. “Punctuality,” says
that monarch, trying to smooth out the dints in
his left flank, “is the politeness of princes. Won’t
someone tell Gasquith to remember Servia and
Montenegro, and Ireland, and Gallipoli, and Meso-
potamia, and put his watch on a bit ? Otherwise I
shall be done in. Can’t he reorganise his time-
table and catch the ’bus?” I am sorry for the
King of Rou. You would have thought he 'would
have been safe in backing the British Lion for a
place. But apparently the time is not yet ripe.
Westralia having had a glorious racket,
the new Government has decided to “fund”
the lOU, and let the kid finish paying for
father’s spree in 1946. Happy Jack!
Unhappy Jackson!
The advantage of making the People feel
an interest in their own undertakings was
never better illustrated than by the fate of
Private Enterprise in motor-’buses in Adel-
aide. The Tramways Trust is a municipal
affair, run by representatives from all of
Greater Adelaide, and liable to have its suc-
cess or failure reflected in the local rates.
So the idea was sensibly cultivated _ that
every ratepayer was black-legging on himself
if he patronised the new motor-’bus services.
This idea soon put the new jiggers out of
business in Adelaide, popular as they have
proved in other cities; and last week the co.
offered everything at auction. Incidentally,
it got no bids that were thought worth
accepting.
Anyhow, the Speck’s Labor party didn't
practise on John Earle for nothing. It has
now kicked out the local members of the

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The belated V.R.C. meeting concluded on
Saturday, when it put up another record in post-
ponements. Before the horses went out for the Steeple-
chase rain fell heavily, and as they fidgeted around
the starting place they experienced the wettest time
of their lives. The rain fell in blinding sheets, and
finally the field was called to shelter a while. Pre-
vious to this the dripping denizens of the flat, or
many of them, had jumped over the railing and
rushed for any shelter they could get. It was a
wild, lawless proceeding, but the rain washed their
guilt away. Later on the downpour slackened into
showers and the Steeple came to pass. It was run
"in quite a normal way. The veteran Booligal took
the lead at once in his old commanding' manner and
stayed out the three miles one furlong without falter-
ing. Seldom, a natty little ’chaser, paced it with
the big fellow until he fell, and then the race was
Booligal’s. Rendrock, who had spoilt his chance by
faulty jumping, did well to finish second, 20 lengths
behind the runaway.
The honors of the w.f.a. racing at Mel-
bourne carnival went to the infirm Lavendo. The
English horse was lucky, but he deserved his luck
for his consistency. Firstly he won the Caulfield
Stakes from Kilboy because the big, striding three-
year-old was not pushed along from the start. Then
he won the Melbourne Stakes luckily from Carlita,
and on Saturday he captured the Fisher Plate because
the breakdown of Wolaroi had left him only one
dangerous opponent. Lavendo was a bit lame and
so low-spirited that the stable declined to back the
invalid. Carlita also had gone off color, so that the
books, although they wanted odds on the mare,
would not lay more than 4 to 1 against Easteourt,
the other starter. The three made a good race of it,
and Lavendo beat the mare with a brilliant effort
in 2min. 35isec. What a good thing he was for
last year’s Caulfield Cup, when he carried little
more than seven stone!
There were only two unimported nags among
the six starters for the V.R.C. Handicap, and
one of them—Juan Fernandez—would evidently have
proved the winner in a fast-run race. As it was.
Aides lasted just long enough to beat him by half
a head. The Final Handicap, run on a sodden course,
was remarkable for the fact that the books, to a
man, were most persistent in laying 4 to 1 against
Rael Locin, the useful gee that had been widely
whispered of as a good thing. He didn’t look like
a moral cert, on paper, and the books, with their
eternal 4 to 1, gave the correct tip. Allegorv won
from Maltravers, which for certain reasons made the
booming of Rael Locin seem easily accounted for.
* * * *
The imported Aides, which annexed the
V.R.C. Handicap, a mile and three-quarters, at
Flemington on Saturday, isn’t much chop, and the
fact emphasises the contention frequently made on
this page that either the local nag has deteriorated
quite a lot or the aggregate Australian trainer is a
horse-murderer on a large scale. Aides ran up close
l n . a couple of minor events a few months back, and
nuked a race not long before the Melbourne Spring
carnival started out on its jolting journey. Where-
upon a misguided public, worried to death by the
constant victories of imported animals, didn’t” even
wait to scratch its head, but promptly stepped in
and backed Aides to win the Melbourne Cup. Any-
thing the immigrant did in that race was not the
reason for making him favorite for the V.R.C. Han-
dicap. Aides has now left the Wheeler stable, which
has had the key to so many rich prizes during the
last 18 months.
* » * *
Sasanof had, to all appearances, begun to
stale off within a week of his winning the Melbourne
Cup. , Quinologist is supposed to have “gone to
pieces ’ during the four days that intervened between
the Tuesday when the Cup race ought to have hap-
pened and the Saturday when it eventuated. The
ancient adage that the race is to the swift has a
very limited application in these cases. In a first-
class handicap held of thoroughbreds there are sev-
eral with the necessary swiftness to win at the
weights. The race is to the fittest on the day, and
the horses with the best tempers and soundest con-
stitutions are the most likely to be the most fit
when fitness is most specially required of them. Con-
sequently a wise tipster accepts latest form as the
only reliable guide in choosing between recent per-
formers. The books regulate their odds by the same
rule in a great measure. If an alleged “good thing”
that has been heavily backed for a particular long-
distance event shows only moderate form in w.f.a.
races preceding the event, the reasonable assumption
is that the animal is not swift enough, or not fit
enough. _ The assumption that the “good thing’’ was
not trying to win a substantial stake (when vic-
tory would not have entailed a penaltv) is merelv
the delusion of fly-flat punters, as a ' rule. The
books, who are the most unbiased of tipsters, always
believe in what they have recently seen, rather than
what is rumored. If a horse makes only a moderate
show in valuable w.f.a. races on two successive
Saturdays they see no reason why it should be ex-
pected to run brilliantly a few days later.
* * * *
Stageland followed up his respectable per-
formance in the Melbourne Cup by winning the
Bendigo Cup last week. The victory was nothing
to skite about, but it fully justified the stable con-
tention that the colt is much better than lie looks.
He is one of the light and narrow sort, and seem-
ingly he can only do his best when the going is
easy. Others of Comedy King’s progeny show the
same want of breadth, 3 r et they have good hearts in
their poor little chests.
It is not often the crowd is ready to lay
. 5 to 4 on in a field of 21, but the incident happened
at Canterbury Park (Sydney) last week. The bet
came off, too. It was in the Nursery Handicap, and
the rush of cash for Conacre, a son of Linacre, would
have kept the war going for quite five minutes.
Conacre is a smart-looking customer and may have
been worth the 400 guineas he cost as a baby.
L. K. S. MACKINNON, Chairman of the
V.R.C.
Now that Sir Bobadil is back to form it
behoves punters to keep a level head when he again
goes into action. Sir Bobadil raced faster than
anything else in Canterbury Park (Sydney) Flving
Handicap on Saturday, and landed home a length
ahead of the next nag. He is a compact little fel-
low, now five years old, and has had his full share
of success. He won at Randwick when a young-
ster, but in his old age prefers the smaller courses.
Aboard Sir Bobby on Saturday was Foley, the
mannikin who was on top of Sasanof in Melbourne
Cup.
* * * *
, So far as two-year-old form has been ex-
posed this season no youngster stands out from any
other. Sam Hordern has a good ’un in Pleasant
Moments, and Bronzetti, another Bronzino, mav
develop into a Derby possibility. Both these
juveniles belong to the Ma State and have proved
sound. Pleasant Moments won two events at the
much-delayed V.R.C. meeting, and Bronzetti cap-
tured Flemington Stakes on Saturday. Any nag
which wins down the straight at Flemington is
usually worth considering in a longer-distanee
event; for here it has to carry the weight all the
way and go straight without a guiding rail. N. S.
Wales has two other performers in Pah King, which
appropriated the Maribyrnong Plate, and Baltic Sea,
that may be doing things a year hence —if all goes
well. But so many things go wrong.

A few days before the Caulfield Cup there
appeared in a Tasmanian paper the account of
a local wedding, the offenders being named Shepard
and King-. Result—a stampede of local tip fiends
for Ikey, who is now nursing a badly wounded neck
and heaping benedictions on the ’appy couple. ‘ I
don’t suppose they had a bob on it themselves either,
he wails. Perhaps not. They were having a bigger
gamble.

“Barcoo”: In the 55 races for the Mel-
bourne Cup, not including the last, the favorite has
won only 11 times. It ran second eight times;
third, four times; fourth, six times; fifth, once;
sixth, thrice ; seventh, thrice; and eighth, twice. It
has also run absolutely last. That was the day I
walked home without a shirt.
* * * *
“Edo”: Coolgardie the other day parted
with its last shred of former glory by winding up
its racing club. The old town has long and keenly
suffered the pangs of poverty, but it stuck to its two
yearly turf meetings through all its misfortunes. Of
course, “the war” is blamed for the disaster, but the
truth is that the bottom has gone out of the onee-
famous place and great is the slump thereof.
“Mujik” : On a recent Saturday 26 races
out of 30 among good-class horses in Australia were
won by animals either imp. or by imp. sires. On
Saturday at Flernington every flat-race winner was
one or the other. And so it goes on with increasing
frequency. Yet there are any number of people
who say it all points to nothing or is a flash in
the pan or a rumor or something. Of course it
means something definite; but, like everything else
that matters just now in this cheerful country, it
will probably be let go hang. Some day a buyer
will get a brain wave and rush off to the Cold
Land looking for hurdlers and ’chasers, and when
he does it is 100 to 1 that the local article will
get snuffed out some more. In that type of thorough-
bred Australia is horribly deficient —yet it is one
that should be reared here with great success.
The law of compensations still holds good.
During the recent race week at Christchurch (M.L.)
Hugo Friedlander and G. D. Greenwood each saw
one of their horses break down in the second race
on the first day. Next day Friedlander won the
N.Z. Cup and Greenwood the Stewards’ Handicap.
J. B. Thompson had a £27,000 warehouse burnt
down. He won the New Zealand Trotting Cup next
day. That afternoon A. W. Rutherford lost the
brightest in his stable—Encore. The following day
the stable went for a big win on Furling and landed
the bacon.

“S.T.S.”: As to the novel, “Wolaroi’s
Cup,” referred to in B. 9/11/’l6. Some of us, hav-
ing lost money on the beast on the strength of such
an obvious tip, want to bring an action for False
Expectations. But counsel says it would be a good
defence that Wolaroi may win a Cup some other
year. So evidently we have to wait till the beast is
dead.
Syd Godfrey (N.S.W.) and Patsy Bran-
nigan argued the matter again at Sydney Stadium
last week. On the first occasion the Yank got a
points verdict. This time he got a hiding and was
so used up by the seventeenth collision that Arthur
Scott stopped the proceedings. Patsy showed any
amount of courage, hut Godfrey’s right was a fre-
quent and purposeful visitor, and every time it
landed it hurt. After the affray Brannigan expressed
the opinion that he had never received such uncalled-
for treatment in the course of 400 fights. Young
Godfrey is a very promising lad. He looks good
enough to put a question or two to Jimmy Hill
about the feather-weight title.

Bill Squires started his come-back cam-
paign at Melbourne on Saturday and collected severe
punishment. The big American Tom McMahon pre-
sented William with a varied collection of swipes,
rips, bashes and biffs as a warning against remain-
ing on the premises, and after William had dropped
with a loud bang on the floor three times Thomas
was not called upon for any more. The sixth round
had not commenced.
Tommy TJren and Harry Stone served
bash a la carte at Brisbane on Saturday night. The
ragtime pug gave LTren 61b. and much to think about.
Uren’s earnest endeavors mostly ended in a search
for the other fellow’s address. From the eighth clash
his right came more into prominence, and the last
five rounds were busy times for America. The
referee took a strictly neutral view of the situation
at the finish, and incurred the usual displeasure.
A Sydney journalist who specialises in
bash was handed a solid bill by a P.M. the other
day— £25 and costs. It all arose out of a letter
written to Les Darcy and handed to a passenger by
an American steamer for delivery. You mustn’t
compete with the post office like that. There was
nothing in the letter of any importance except one
sentence —“Your name here now is Putty.” That
puts it about right, and makes it a matter for some
regret that the letter did not get through. Someone
equally frank ought to spend 2d. on stamps and
give the young man the news. It would do him a
lot of good.

“Eddy”: I am told that even the axeman’s
game as a popular sport is no longer as clean as it
might be. The bookie has butted in, and choppers
who were always square are now sometimes squared.
It’s a ghastly shame, for this sport, like all that spring
from the daily toil of competitors, was of the great-
est value and interest. Never have I met such
enthusiasts as I encountered among the keen blades
in Vic. and Tasmanian big timber. The men
exulted in their prowess with the passionate earnest-
ness of the true craftsman. A few years ago I
spent three days in a sawmillers’ camp in Gippsland.
There were four first-class axemen in the party, and
the pride they took in their ability to sweep down
a forest giant was as good as a little gold-mine to
the boss. One lad whom his mates called the Ringer
ate into the bush like a duck into a tub of butter.
I watched him for a whole afternoon, fascinated by
liis skill and almost miraculous industry. He was
perhaps 26, sft. Bin., lithe as a whip-lash, and as
lean. I went up to his hut with him after 5 o’clock,
and noticed a couple of sawn logs standing near.
“What are they for?” I asked. “The logs?” he
said. “Oh, a bloke might feel like lashin’ out a bit
after tea. Them’s for practice.”
* * * l *
It looks like being a nervous season for
the Sydnev surfer. Big sharks have been seen and
caught inshore at all the principal surfing beaches,
and though the prowling brute is often as amiable
as a policeman, there’s never any telling when his
mood will change. Apropos of sharks’ appetites,
one of the Williamson brothers who took the sub-
marine movies in the clear waters of Bermuda, found
that the shark was not the eager scavenger he is
supposed to be. After trying much “high” bait, the
Williamsons hung a slaughtered calf before their
submarine cabin window. Nothing happened for
half an hour. Then a 30-foot horror swam up,
studied the meal carefully from all angles, and
went away for his partner. The pair made a joint
inspection and then called up six friends. The
private view went on for six interminable hours
until there were 30 swimming round. There
wasn’t a sign of excitement until one shark in
passing risked a bite. Instantly the whole school
went mad, snapping not only at the bait, but at
each other and scraps of inedible floating debris.
Cowardice and gluttony late for dinner, and very
mad about it.
* * * *
“Groper”: Armchair sportsmen complain
that Westralia is a poor place to look for food for
gun and fishing line. They libel the country. With
a pal I had the time of my life recently on the
Blackwood River, within a few miles of the Leeuwin.
Grey duck, mountain duck, wood duck, teal, divers,
parrots and fish of great variety, including schnap-
per, bream, sea-mullet, whiting and salmon-trout
abound. Curried marran (the mammoth gilgie)
helped the gorge along. And kangaroo and wallaby
provided changes of diet. The climate of the dis-
trict, like the other well-favored south-western por-
tions of this Band’s End of the Commonwealth, has
the habit of making the oldest inhabitants feel like
mere striplings.
Fairly hooked on a light line, a big shark
seems to be worth anything from 60 to 90 minutes’
brisk play to an experienced angler. Sydney fisher-
men lately have been putting up some great -beach
fights with blue pointers and grey nurses of from Bft.
to 12ft. One brute ran out 150yds. of light thread
line and gave the expert with the rod a run of a
mile along Narrabeen Beach. Tackle used by one of
these big-game hunters is a tarpon rod and 300yds.
of American cutty-hunk line with a piano-wire trace
and three small brass swivels. Mullet bait. It
looks as light as cobweb, but it holds like a mort-
gage. If you dared to suggest more massive tackle
to these sports they’d stun you.

Rowing breeds sound sports at Warrnam-

Jolted by the increase in the number of
motor-car accidents, the Law in N. S. Wales has
decided to put the brake on hard. Where notices
are posted to that effect, speed is to be restricted to
four miles an hour ; and in the absence of a notice,
six miles is to be the limit when passing the entrance
to ferry wharves, schools during dismissal hours,
and upon any congested street. If the new regula-
tions are strictly enforced there is going to be much
angry grunting amongst the motor-hogs. Some of
them will probably sell their flying bedsteads in dis-
gust and rejoin the walking classes.
While Victorian motor-cyclist H. A.
Parsons was going great guns last week in the
attempt to fracture Yankee Erwin Baker’s 24-hour
record of 1027 miles, a mob of sheep upended him
into the dust and wrecked the hardware. Parsons
had stirred the dust up over 305 miles in 387 min.
at the time of the calamity, and was only warming
up for the journey.

The Dunlop Rubber Go. got a good ad.
out of the carnival of motor-cars at Flemington on
Melbourne Cup Day. In the reserve for vehicles 728
cars were counted, and neaily half of them were
Dunlop-tyred. The foreigners that came second and
third scored between 400 arid 500 each, as against
1589 Dunlops. The Australian make won in a
canter. . There were 24 competitors.

It has been decided to stage no senior
cricket in Hobart this season, but one ground—that
at Newtown—is being kept in some sort of trim,
and on it schoolboy matches run their course.
W. Hughes (North Perth) put up a rare
performance at the opening of Westralian premier-
ship cricket by taking nine wickets for nine runs
out of a total of 78 made by Claremont. Hughes
is fast, and is said to be the greatest left-hander
Groperland has yet known.
* * * *
Frank E. Allan, “the bowler of a century,”
celebrated the passing of 50 years since he donned
flannels for Albert Park in Victorian cricket by
umpiring the recent South Melbourne v. St. Ivilda
fixture. Jack Blackham and Allan are the only
Victorian survivors of the ’7B team; but of the
whole bunch eight are still going strong. Among
those who are out are Harry Boyle, W. Midwinter,
Billy Murdoch and Tommy Horan.

Christian Brothers’ College has a fine
schools’ athletic record in Westralia. It has been
undefeated at premiership football for 10 years;
at rowing, this season’s win made the seventh in 16
years; and at the athletic championship meeting
recently the Collegians’ success made the ninth
offence in an unbroken run.
STUMPS DRAWN!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where are all the flannelled clan
On this perfect playing day—
Spofforth, Murdoch, Bannerman,
Each a master in his way ?
Where are those that cheered them on
From the packed pavilion?
Shod in white with linen hat,
How they held our hearts in thrall—
Massey with his shining bat,
Turner with his cunning ball!
Hark again the shouts of old—
“ Bravo! Middle stump! Well bowled!”
Where is now that human hive
That rent Heaven with cheers to see
Bonnor’s most Homeric drive,
When he lifted mightily
High and still more high the ball
Over clock and tower and all ?
Many years have passed since then,
Since that most amazing sight;
Boys, who saw it, grown to men
Still recall it, pipes alight,
As companioned well they walk
Lost in old-time' cricket talk.
Ah, the joy, the thrill intense,
Watching from the crowded hill,
“Fourers” to the picket fence,
“Fivers” over! Ah, the chill
Or the loud, triumphant shout
When the umpire nodded —Out!
State and Test—what joys they were
When the game was in its prime!
How the blood in us would stir
Into ecstasy what time
Cutting, driving, hard and sweet,
Some bold batsman saved defeat!
How the noise roared round the town,
Making good the passing hours,
When the Vies, went tumbling down,
And we knew the match was ours!
How we drooped downcast, ashamed,
When the Vies, the victory claimed!
Where are they, the blithe, the bold,
Whom it was our joy to watch ?
Some are grey and all are old,
Some have played their final match—■
Shouldered bats and gravely gone
To the packed Pavilion.
\
Cone, too, are the watching throng;
Now no more their plaudits rise.
All is silent save the song
Of a lone lark in the skies ;
And—the sole life of the scene—
Swallows skim across the green.

Every Man and Woman can
have PERFECT HEALTH!
“No matter how much learning you may acquire, no matter
how you may develop your talents, no matter how much
money you may earn, if through ignorance of your own
body you suffer ill-health, and die years before your time,
your education will have been a failure.”
Why be handicapped in life’s battle through ill-health ?
Why suffer needless aches and pains?
Why allow yourself to become run-down, nervy, out-of-sorts,
and liable to contract the various complaints to which
mankind is subject?
Why not become a strong, vigorous and perfectly-healthy
being, as Nature intended you to be?
Regular and proper exercise, such as I prescribe in my
Postal Course of Health and Strength Culture
will make you fit and keep you strong and healthy. Don’t
think that your ease is the exception—it’s not. You will
find my exercises both beneficial and enjoyable pastime.
You will look forward to the time when you have to do
them, and find the benefits very rapid.
The deep-breathing exercises included in my Course will
build up your chest, broaden your shoulders, strengthen vour
lungs and make you breathe in a natural way.
My booklet, entitled “Health and Strength from Self-
Culture,” tells all about my methods, fees, etc. I should
like to send you a copy. Just write your name and address

HIGH day and holiday shoes, for wear on
extra-special occasions with the extra-
special gown, ought, one feels, to have
something distinctive about them, some-
thing that lifts them above the shoes for every-
day wear and tear. It is this distinctive, this
different look, that makes the charm of the most
elegant shoes in the Bostock range, the delightful
little black satin shoe here illustrated, for ex-
ample. One has only to glance at the picture to see
that here is something very smart and desirable.
Then think of it on, showing daintily, captivat-
ingly, beneath the flounced or scalloped hem of
the "summer gown. Nothing could be more appro-
priate or more charming. And with all its
daintiness and piquancy, it is the most comfortable
and well-fitting of shoes, as indeed are all those
short-fronted styles, and will suit most women,
giving that ease, lightness and coolness which the
Australian climate requires.

From “Rosna” in London:—
Adelaide’s Parliamentary warrior, Lieut. W. J.
Denny, who is with the Australian Artillery, dashed
through London on leave the other day, looking
thoroughly fit. As far as I remember he was going
to “do” Shakspeare’s England and Dickens’s London
and get back for an appointment with the Hun the
same evening.
Artist Dora Meeson Coates, policewoman, quelled
a riot the other day. A huge soldier was fighting
a good-sized crowd and couldn’t be quelled until
the Australian woman came along and said a sooth-
ing word. Then he went with her to the lock-up
quite meekly and accepted 36 days with joy.
The Australian Red Cross has now taken our
Anzac prisoners of war in Germany to its motherly
heart, and is doing its bit to circumvent starva-
tion, freezing and similar German pleasantries. It
sends each man a good outfit of warm clothes, with
a weekly parcel of bread and cheese from Switzer-
land and a five-shilling lot of tinned edibles from
London. The uniform prescribed by Hun orders is
navy with violent yellow trimmings. If these are
not sewn on so that neither man nor beast could
ever get them off again, the whole show is confis- •
cated by the Kaiser’s minions.
“A.M.D.”: A word with “G.D.M.” (B.
16/11/’l6) regarding his one-eyed view of
the Y.M.C.A.. incidental to his attack on
wowserism. He bunched the association
with others as “a collective pestilential
nuisance, and as my inferiors as men and
women.” What arrogance is this! I
write as one who walked out of a comfort-
able, cheerful, anti-killjoy home in the month
of August. 1914, and changed into khaki
from the glad rags of ordinary society; ex-
changed a cosy bed for the hard ground, with
a kitbag for a pillow, and mysterious stew
and bread and jam for the comfortable table
of home-life; and after a voyage in a trans-
port helped for a year and nine months to
keep in safety “G.D.M.” and his ilk, who
all the time were able to comfortably drink
their “pint of claret with their dinner”
and practise “love of clubs and clubmen” to
their full. I write also as a clubman of
years’ standing, and I say to “G.D.M.” that
it is time he knew that no organisation on
active service, whether on the training-ground
or in the battlefield, is so useful to Billjim as
the Y.M.C.A. Its work is beyond praise;
and The Bulletin has itself borne testi-
mony thereto. It knows no sect, it makes
no attempt to thrust any doctrine down the
throat of any individual. It treats in
strictly impartial fashion every man in
khaki, be he general or private. Tens of
thousands pf Australian soldiers have writ-
ten home on Y.M.C.A. notepaper, with
Y.M.C.A. pens, at absolutely no cost to the
individual. This is but one item of its use-
fulness. The whole army could tell of the
clean and wholesome food supplied, very
often at less than cost; of entertainments
running from high-class music to rough-and-
tumble boxing bouts; informative lectures
by authorities on subjects immediately
affecting the life of Billjim; literature, from
the local daily of some wayback town to
The Bulletin ; libraries covering science,
art, militarism, fiction and everything that
adorns the old shelves at home. The
Y.M.C.A. huts are actually in the trenches
on the blood-soaked fields of France. Wow-
sers. are they? Killjoys, are they? If so,
“G.D.M.” will have to class every grateful
Australian soldier in the same category.
“Eddyson” on one of the traditions of Yam :
When Mrs. Pocoek died, leaving a lumbering husband
and two large, lumbering sons, aged 30, and known
in the district as “The Twin,” old Pocock prevailed
upon Mrs. Winnie from Seven Bells to become house-
keeper for the family at Wandong. Wandong was
a large farm with cows, including pigs, and an
orchard, likewise poultry. Mrs. Winnie received one
pound a week and keep, and she earned it. Her
duties were not defined —while there was something
to do she was expected to -do it, and there were
always at least two things waiting to be done. Mrs.
Winnie said she was 26, and she didn’t look a day
over 30, a wholesome, brown, hard-fleshed, amiable
dame. The Twin promptly fell in love with Mrs.
Winnie. The Twin had a bewildering habit of
doing things suddenly and simultaneously. Sam
and Dan invaded Mrs. Winnie’s kitchen and pro-
posed to Mrs. Winnie at the same moment, in the
same words. Sam and Dan were so alike that Mrs.
Winnie was to be excused for her inability to choose
between them. “Go ’way, man,” she said, “and
don’t make a fool of yourself.” The Twin was fre-
quently addressed as one. One or two, it was a most
persistent suitor till old Pocock butted in with
3ft. of red gum, and promised 10 days in bed to
the next man found interfering with his housekeeper.
There was comparative calm for six months, when
old Pocock died. On the way back from the inter-
ment the Twin proposed to Mrs. Winnie. Mrs. Winnie
temporised. Her inability to make up her mind
led to the first serious difference between Sam and
Dan. They had never been known to disagree over
anything before, but they disagreed most emphati-
cally over Mrs. Winnie, and the sight of them tumb-
ling but of the kitchen and fighting it out in the
back yard was so frequent that it ceased to interest
everybody but Andrew Carl. Carl was employed
at Pearce’s sawmill in the next paddock, and would
always take a few minutes off, if possible, to sit
round and watch the Twin knocking the hide off
each other. “Have it out, man,” he would say.
He had seen them at it a dozen times, and there
was no change in his demeanor —lie was always
desirous of more. Meanwhile Mrs. Winnie was ap-
parently wholly unconcerned. “Glad to have the
boy out of the house,” she explained. “When he’s
fighting himself he isn’t worrying me.” If it had
not been for Carl the Twin would have had no
encouragement at all. His presence often caused
what might have been mere scrims to develop into
pitched battles. The final encounter occurred on a
Sunday afternoon. Because they had nothing to do,
and as Carl was making it a very willing go, half
a dozen mill hands were assembled on the wood-
heap, watching the contest. After the tenth round
the Twin tired. Carl got them going again. In
spite of their weariness and their damages he got
two more rounds out of them. He hustled for a
third. “Better settle it,” he said. The Twin
shook their heads. “Oh-h, go on!” snorted Carl.
“Be a man. Have it out.” They declined. “Well,
look here,” said Carl, “you’ve simply got to eome
to a decision, because after this I can’t allow no
man to fight for my wife!” Proofs were forthcom-
ing. Mrs. Winnie was really Mrs. Winnie Carl.
She and Carl had been “separated,” and Carl had
followed her to Yam in the hope of effecting a
reconciliation. “But why didn’t you tell me?” wailed
the Twin in unison. Mrs. Winnie’s explanation was
satisfactory. “Well, you see.” she said, “I thought
it would do Carl good to let him see there was
another boy wanting me.”

Good Health and Beauty
go Hand in Hand
Beauty is the outward sign of good health. Good
health is the bodily necessity for beauty.
Not only those who possess classical features are
beautiful. Some women have possessed a feature,
mouth nose or eyes, that was not perfect, and
yet were considered beautiful. Why? Because
they were healthy looking, their skin was clear,
their eyes were bright and their brain was active.

Ks e q u e n t
a simple remedy
If you have no
need only get
about an ounce from your chemist and add
just sufficient water to dissolve it. A little
of this simple lotion is Nature’s own beauti-
fier. It' is very good for the skin and in-
stantly gives the complexion a soft, velvety,
youthful bloom that any woman might envy.
It lasts all day or evening, renders powder-
ing entirely unnecessary, and absolutely
defies detection.
COSMETICS can never really help a poor
complexion ; often they are positively
harmful. The sensible, rational way is to
actually remove the thin veil of stifling,
half-dead scarf skin from the face, and give
the fresh, vigorous and beautiful young skin
underneath a chance to show itself and to
breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way,
by merely applying mercolised wax at night,
like cold cream, and washing it off in the
morning. It absorbs the disfiguring cuticle
gradually and harmlessly, leaving a brilliant
natural complexion. Of course, this also
takes with it all such facial blemishes as
red blotches, tan,, moth patches, sallowness,
liver spots, etc. As a freckle remover and
general complexion beautifier this old-
fashioned remedy is unequalled.

BLACKHEADS, oily skins and enlarged
pores usually go together, but can be
instantly corrected by a unique new process.
A tablet of stymol, obtained from the chem-
ist’s is dropped in a tumbler of hot water,
which will then of course “fizz” briskly.
Secrets of Beauty
The Cream of Modern Beauty Advice
By “MIMOSA.”
When the effervescence has subsided the face
is bathed with the stymol-charged water and
then dried with a towel. The offending
blackheads, of their own accord, come right
off on the towel, the large oily pores imme-
diately contract and efface themselves natu-
rally. There is no squeezing, forcing or any
drastic action. The skin is left uninjured,
smooth, soft and cool. A few such treat-
ments should be taken at intervals of three
or four days thereafter in order to ensure
the permanence of the pleasing result so
quickly obtained.
BEAUTIFUL hair adds immensely to
the personal magnetism of both men
and women. Actresses and smart women
are ever on the look-out for any harmless
thing that will increase the natural beauty
of their hair. The latest method is to use
pure stallax as a shampoo on account of
the peculiarly glossy, fluffy and wavy effect
which it leaves. As stallax has never been
used much for this purpose it comes to the
chemist only in sealed original packages,
enough for twenty-five or thirty shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair, apart
from its beautifying effect.
*** * *
IT is astonishing the number of women
who suffer from the humiliating afflic-
tion of superfluous hair, and I am sorry to
say that through ignorance or wrong treat-
ment the majority of them have made matters
considerably worse by causing the hairs to
grow more quickly and stronger than before.
It only requires a little thought to realise
the folly of it all. Removing the surface
growth for a few days may give temporary
relief, but in order to obtain permanent
results the hair roots must be killed. Caustic
depilatories are worse than useless, and on
no account should the hairs be pulled out.
Apart from the electric needle, which is a
costly and painful process, any chemist will
tell you that the best home treatment is
pure powdered pheminol, w r hich has a de-
vitalising effect upon the. hair roots, in addi-
tion to which it removes all trace of the
objectionable hair in a few seconds- and the
recommended treatment gradually, but
surely, dissolves out the hair follicles, which
is the only method of permanently ridding
oneself of this terrible disfigurement. [6

HALF-YEARLY REPORT of the Directors of THE BANK OF AUSTRALASIA
„ With the Accounts for the Half-year to 10th April, 1916,
Presented to the Proprietors at the Half-yearly General Meeting, held on Thursday, sth October, 1916.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the Balance-sheet as at 10th April last, with the Profit
Account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and Aus-
tralasian rates and taxes, and after making provision for bad and doubtful debts and other contingencies,
the net profit for the half-year amounted to £206,662 14s. 2d.
Out of this the Directors have declared a Dividend for the half-year at the rate of 14 per cent, per
annum, or £2 16s. per share, and a Bonus at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, or 12s. per share, to-
gether £3 Bs. per share, free of income-tax. This will absorb £170,000. The Directors have further
apropnated £30,000 to the Reserve Fund, leaving a balance of profit for the half-year of £6662 14s. 2d.
To this sum must be added £115,096 Bs. 4d., brought forward from the previous half-year, making a total
of £121,759 2s. 6d. to be carried forward to the next account.
Ju 6 and Bonus will be payable, in London and in Australasia, on the 6th October.
The Directors record, with deep regret, the death of their colleague, Viscount Quenington, M.P.,
Adjutant Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, who was killed in action in April last.
„r, T ° I? 11 the vacancy thus created, the Directors have appointed The Rt. Hon. Viscount Midleton,
K. 1., whose name will be submitted for the approval of the Proprietors at the Annual General Meeting
in 1917, in accordance with the provisions of the Deed of Settlement.
Since the date of the last Report, the Branch at Beechworth, Victoria, has been closed.

We have examined the cash and securities in London, and the London books, and have verified the
transfers (from the several branches in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and we beg to report
that, in our opinion, the foregoing is a full and fair balance-sheet of the bank, and that it exhibits
a true and correct view of the state of the bank’s affairs as shown by the books. The investments
were valued, so far as could be ascertained, at market price or under.

married and unmarried, are already at the Front or

couldn’t be done by the few others available, and
(3) because it was desirable that the wbrk should
be done, and that is proved best by the fact that
the recruiting and eonscriptionist bodies of at least
four States applied for permission to make use of

Confronted by this year’s one solitary
Agricultural student, Dr. Cherry, hoe-and-
furrow professor at Melbourne Uni., decided
to go and help the A.M.C. mend the boys
who are away lead-spraying Hun-infested
Europe. Another professor (Osborne, of the
Medical School) hopes to leave soon for the
battlefields via Frisco.
Rev. Frank Isitt, the waterwaggoner, con-
tested more electorates than any other
Maorilander. In electorates where only
one candidate offered, Isitt, in order to have
a poll taken and so give the anti-grog crowd
a local-option vote, would butt in with his
nomination. Sometimes he contested eight
or nine seats simultaneously. If a couple
of electorates had chosen him by any chance
there would have been trouble. But he
never found a place. The Isitts are full of
fight. Leonard was even a more prominent
protagonist than Frank; and Willard, Leo-
nard’s second son, battled in the trenches
and had to battle to reach them. He was
turned down because of a faulty eye, but,
determined to do his bit, got into a boxing
match and persuaded his opponent to wallop
the blockading organ and black it. Next
day with his optic in hospital he dropped
into a recruiting depot and beat the
examiners.
A horrible churn of wheels, a groan and a bang,
And a great “tank” moved out which gave Fritz a
pang!
Over a broken gun, a trench and a fence,
Straight towards the Huns, and hence
A terrible slaughter;
It was a mortar.
Yet still the Huns fought her,
Although they’d sooner bought her!
It stood and swept the German trenches clear,
Both right and left the Huns dropped in fear
With a lead bullet
Where sometimes a pullet
Meets the axe on a summer’s day—
That’s the way the “tanks” enter the fray,
And Tommy Atkins earns his pay,
In a distant land far away!

SAFETY
*][ Enjoyable touring and efficient commercial transport
are alike impossible without the sense of security imparted
by good tyres. The toughness of Avon rubber and the
strength of Avon casing reduce to a minimum the risk of
punctures or bursts, and the sure grip of the “ Sunstone '*
ladder-grooved tread makes you as skid-proof as it is
possible to be —whatever the weathei, whatever the road.
COMFORT
Superior resilience alone can reveal the maximum com-
fort of motoring on pneumatic tyres. Many a car owes
its reputation for luxurious springing and silky running to
the buoyant liveliness of its Avon Tyres.
ECONOMY
<}[ The same qualities of strength and resilience that
achieve safety and comfort necessarily cut down ultimate
costs —of petrol, repairs to chassis and tyres as well.
Avon economy is the economy of endurance —the typically
British sort of tyre beauty that is more than tread-deep.
The claim that Avon Tyres show lowest cost per mile rests
upon disinterested records of average mileage in everyday
service, open to investigation and capable of demon-
stration on your vehicle.

The Drapers of Queensland
FINNEY, ISLES & CO. LTD.,
The Big Block, BRISBANE.
IN
BANANA LAND
A great silence, lasting nearly 30 years,
was broken in Brisbane the other day- when
Jimmy Cowlishaw, chairman of the South
Brisbane Gas Co., spluttered a few remarks
in the House of Fossils to protest against
an invasion of the rights of Private Enter-
prise.
“F. 8.”: Queensland Government Analyst
J. B. Henderson finds that Bananaland
wastes 10 million gallons of molasses every
year, which means 11 million gallons of
spirit. I have seen the fish in a Queensland
river come to the surface drunk and helpless
opposite the molasses vent that opened into
the stream opposite a big sugar mill. You
could pick up the boozers and lift them into
your boat.
“L.S.” : Minister for Lands Hunter, w T ho
is regarded as the business man of the Gov-
erpment, looks a certainty for the job of
Agent-General. Thomas Robinson, who is
now. in the chair in London, has no claim on
the job after January next; but the Govern-
ment intends to tell him that he can go on
for a month or two. Then Hunter will
arrive. Other Ministerial changes are likely
to take place about the same time, and it
is possible that Premier Ryan will take a
judgeship. Hunter and Ryan are insepar-
able in the political world, and when one
goes out the other will probably follow.
Theodore has his eye on the Premiership,
but it is doubtful if he will get it, as his
sure following in the caucus of 45 members
is only about 14.
The Auditor-General’s report makes sad
reading. There was a loss on State rail-
ways for 1915-16 of £610,536, owing to “re-
duced. hours and increased wages.” The
munitions experiment, a horrible fiasco, cost
£lO,OOO. The State sawmill shows a loss
for nine months of £1380; the State coal-
mine at Warra a loss for nine months of
£l6Bl. Still £335,461 has been now spent on
four cattle-stations, and the profit off those
is of course going to paint the
whole picture pink. How they are going to
do it and also provide cheap meat is another
matter.
A Northern Billzac suddenly recovered his
speech the other day, after being unable to
say a word for over six months. Wounds in
the head received at Gallipoli did the dam-
age, and all the efforts of the doctors were
in vain. Returning from Sydney by train
after consulting a specialist without success,
he heard a girl screech that there was
a nia > under the wheels; but the biggest
shock .me received was when she heard Bill-
zac’s sympathy in a hoarse, strained Amice,
“Poor devil!” He was the cheeriest Billzac
in Australia for the remainder of the trip.
As always happens, the removal of the
cheap nigger from the scene has been fol-
lowed in the sugar industry by no end of
mechanical improvements. Until a very
few years ago all that electricity did for the
business was to supply a little lighting. Now
the pumps for the big water supply neces-
sary are electrically driven, Avhile press-tlie-
button capstans haul the cane trucks between
the carrier siding and the cane rakes. There
is a cane grab at the Racecourse Mill.
Mackay. which travels along a revolving
yard arm, supported by a lofty steel frame
mast, and picks up the cane from the ground
within a half-acre area. So perfect is its
mechanism that it can lift a single stick of
cane or a pile three tons in weight and
deposit the load on to the carrier feeding

by 20 men, and, oiving to the job being the
most irksome in the mill, Monday mornings
found many of the hands still down and out
at the neighboring pub and the plant held
up through insufficient cane going to the
rollers. The grab cost £5OOO and it is
reckoned that it saves about £2OOO a year.

duced on country in the WesJ which at one
time was a huge cattle-walk, and on all sides
declared fit for no other purpose, just as
practically similar country in the Territory
is so declared to-day by people who no doubt
have personal and particular reasons for
giving false evidence. The greasy wool men-
tioned came off Evora station, situated
within the edge of what used to be reck-
lessly described on the map as the Great
Australian Desert. It now carries millions
of sheep, besides cattle and horses. The day
will come when the so-called desert round the
foot of the McDonnell Ranges, Central Aus-

plaint.
Welcome news from the Telegraph
(14/11/’l6) :—•
To Let, with young widow, three nice unfurnished
Rooms, clean, near tram, 6s. week. Lonely, this
office.
The police and the fire-brigade are trying to
stop the rush.
“Norbell”: One more use for the kerosene
tin. A section sliced lengthways from each
side of it provides you with two shal-
low trays for holding letters, kills, etc.
These trays are used in all the A.l.r.
orderly rooms and offices in Bananaland, and
serve their purpose quite as well as the
expensive wicker or wire contrivances which
you’ll find in the cheapest city office. Ike
military heads are tigers for economy. They
have even been known to spend £417 6s. 9td.
on an inquiry touching an alleged overcharge
of 7d. on a bag of chaff.
The honor of introducing the porcupine
curse to the Taroom district belongs to one
Hook, who proudly brought the first seed-
lings to Roehedale station, somewhere about
the year when Queensland was sliced from
N. S. Wales. Hook had been across the
border, and carried tiie precious seedlings in
his .saddle-pouch a distance of 400 miles,
afterwards carefully planting them in a
choice spot in the station garden. The
beautiful pieces of horticulture now bloom
all over millions of acres of the local land-
scape,
“Barcoo”: Up North the most generally
useful animal (bar woman, perhaps) is
the common or garden goat. The male,
emasculated in its youth, holds its
condition even in drought, and when killed
and served as roast or boiled mutton not one
diner in a hundred can tell the difference.
' When corned the difficulty increases. Kid,
served as lamb, is just the thing. In the far-
back pubs the larder on coach days is always
replenished with fresh mutton from the goat-
herd. The gentle nannie, on her part, fills
baby’s feeding-bottle and improves the morn-
ing tea. Both flesh and milk are uncom-
monly pure, as the goat is an extraordinarily
healthy beast. In the country towns the
youth harnesses them in teams of from four
to 10 in small vehicles made for the purpose,
and thus draws firewood and water, the latter
at the rate of a shilling per cask. He like-
wise delivers goods from the stores or rail-
way station for a consideration. The skins
of the slaughtered animals, if cured cor-
rectly, make comfortable floor mats. Tanned,
they may be converted into boot tops that
wili wear out cast-iron soles; and the pelt
of the kid, when treated and made into a
waistcoat, would fetch a sigh of satisfaction
from Billjim battling through the winter in
the trenches.
You Are the Harp,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You are the harp, and the wind that comes—
The bro'Wn Avest wind from the sun-dried
plain—
Makes you quiver and bend and sigli ;
The hot brown wind that goes SAveeping by
To harry the crackling grain.
You are the harp, and the soft south
breeze —-
The cool green breeze where the hills unroll,
Bringing the breath of the resined piue,
Delicate daisy and eglantine—
Makes laughter in your soul.
You are the harp, and the cold east wind —
The bleak grey wind with its taste of rain—
Will make you sob on a minor note,
Catching the laughter in your throat,
And send you to prayer again.
You are the harp, and the red north Avind—
The Avind that lashes the river Avhite —
Will mutter of martial moods to you
Till your pulses throb as the war drums do
When the heroes go to fight.
You are the harp, and from East and West
Your lovers seek you, from North and South ;
And I know, though I SAveep your strings
to-day
To find the notes that my touch can play
In the music of your mouth,
That you are the harp, and the day must
dawn
When other fingers response shall find,
My melody die beneath newer things—
For you are the harp of a hundred strings
And your lovers are the wind !

Brisbane, November 25, 1916.
My Dear Thargomindaii, —
The row about the Residential Club for
returned soldiers is over. The R.S.A. will
take control of the institution, but all men
in uniform will be welcome. A building has
been bought, and the only thing that is
wanted now is the wherewithal to pay tor
the embellishments.
The Repatriation Fund is to get another
lift. This time the lift will be represented
by a Golden Casket, and for five shillings,
my dear, anybody is liable to win ioULKJ.
The Attorney-General has let it be known
that he will be in the front trenches when
the anti-gambling league rages to the front
with its brolly and elastic-side boots.
The Toy Fund for the kiddies of soldiers
and sailors is building up. The committee
meeting the other morning was enlivened by
the remarks of a lady who said that she
would not work with a lot of anti-conscrip-
tionists. As the only alleged “anti” present
had two sons at the Front the argument
fizzled out for lack of fuel. Fuel is
frightfully scarce just now, Thargomindah.
Requests for the establishment of baby
clinics are about to be handed in to Home
Secretary Huxham. It is possible that the
first of these helps to little Australia may
be established at the State Home for Infants
at Wooloowin —a home which is a credit to
the hamlet. There are 50 infants in the
domicile.
Eileen Kingsbury, the only daughter of
Crown Prosecutor and Mrs. Kingsbury, was
married this morning to young Sachs, a good
Australian despite his distant-looking name.
Florence Micheli brightened life’s worries
with a sing-song on Wednesday afternoon.
Doris Micheli (’cello) and Amy Mills (con-
tralto) helped her to attain the object of
her mission.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Died in Bundaberg, Dr. Thomas Henry
May. a big-hearted man who has doctored
Sugartown for nearly 40 years. May made
a pile out of his practice in the early days,
but investments in sugar relieved him of
much of it and an uncommonly generous
disposition prevented much subsequent accu-
mulation. He was a father to the poor, and
at 74 he was still too young to be spared
when the Black Camel called.
The Queensland Government’s Bill to dis-
allow lawyers who represent “monopoly
companies” from sitting in Parliament is
aimed at Macartney (of Thynne and Macart-
ney), one of the most awkward opponents of
the Byan Government. At the time of the
’9l strike Thynne and Macartney used to
do the legal battling for the unions; and
even Eat didn’t suggest that that was a
good enough reason to disqualify them as
legislators. Yet it may have been. There
are certainly 62 other good reasons why no
lawyer at all should be eligible for Parlia-
ment.
Retailed recently in the Assembly the
story of how Charles Lilley complimented a
man charged with murder on his able de-
fence by remarking that one would think
he came from the Legislative Assembly.
“Thank God,” said the accused, “I have not
come down as low as that.” It recalls a
Parkes yarn which had a finish in the same
Assembly. Many years ago a Sydney Domain
deputation headed by a fiery young orator
bearded Parkes. The Domain Demosthenes
poured out such eloquence as even the
old man had seldom listened to, and he was
half paralysed for a moment. At length he
rose. “Young man,” he said, solemnly, “be-
ware ! With your tongue, in 10 years you
will either be hin Parliament or hin gaol.”
Parliament it was. The young orator was
Joe Lesina, afterwards M.L.A. for Clermont.
“Bill, jun.”: After the attack on Abdul
at Bir-el-abd, where the Australians and
Maorilanders behaved never more gallantly,
there was an act of bravery that will always
live in my memory. One of the British
aeroplanes was brought down by enemy fire
in our lines. Although the landing was well
made the pilot was seen to get out and stagger-
in a drunken fashion towards our patrol.
On getting close to him we saw that he was
mortally wounded. At first the poor chap
did not know he was among friends, but
when at last his brain grasped the fact he
made his report and expired. A hero if ever
there was one! While dying, this brave man
brought his machine safely to earth and
finished his job before his spirit would give
in. In the ’plane was found the observer —
dead. His head hung over the side and the
front of the machine was covered with
blood.

PAT O’MAORI.
Melbourne Argus is suspected of having a
member of the I.W.W. on its composing staff.
Anyway, the name of the paper’s favorite
suburb was the other day printed Toorank.
Ronald O. Duncan, of Christchurch
(M.L.), who has just offered his country
residence, Glenmark, formerly the home of
millionairess Mrs. A. Q. Townend, to the
Canterbury Patriotic Association as a con-
valescent hospital for Wounded soldiers, is
still a comparative youngster. He com-
menced to earn tucker with the late Arthur
Ollivier, accountant, as stamp-licker at five
bob a week, at the age of 14. He was head
of staff at 19; passed his exam, as associate
of the Institute of Accountants at 20, and
was thus the youngest in the Dominion;
commenced business on his own account at
22 with a capital of 13 pence; and presently
intermingled his auditing with some daring
speculations in station properties which
turned up trumps. He retired from business
last December with his pile made and roofed
over.
“Wairau”: The current number of M.L.
Agricultural Journal supports “Nick
Bottom” (B. 5/10/T6)
A Taranaki farmer has written to the Department
regarding a milking-apparatus which is evidently on
sale in the Dominion. His letter reads as follows:
“No doubt you have come into touch with the
milking-machine, composed of rubber tubes and silver
siphons to put up the cows’ teats. Unfortunately I
bought three of them last February, and I had not
used them three days before 10 or 12 cows were suffer-
ing from swollen udders. I had to stop using them,
and all the cows came back right again except one,
which became so bad that her back was up. I
drenched and rugged her and saved her life, but the
back half of her udder mortified and dropped off.
Will you kindly write me your opinion of this
machine, and if you know of anyone else who has been
‘had’ with it? I think it is a pity such things
are sold in M.L. for milking.”
The condition set up in these cows is just what
might have been expected to happen as a result of
the use of such an apparatus in the hands of a dairy-
farmer. Quite apart from the risk of setting up in-
flammation of the udder through direct injury to the
•tissues, resulting from the tubes being pushed too far
up the teat, or through the introduction into the
udder of germs capable of setting up an inflammatory
condition, the continued daily use of teat-tubes for
milking cows is very undesirable. Muscles guard the
outflow of milk from the teat, and in time it would
probably be found that muscular relaxation has been
caused to a sufficient extent to make the cow unpro-
fitable through leaking away of the milk.
From Arthur Baxter Bruce, honorary
six-and-eightpence of the N.S.AV. Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals: —
Apparently “Aneb” (B. 9/11/’l6) is unaware of
the difficulties which the Society has to face. He
complains that it does not extend its operations to
dairying districts. Unfortunately we have to rely
upon public subscription, subsidised £ for £ by
the Government. Subscribers are very bashful, ami
the Government does not extend any further help,
such as free railway passes to its officers, as is done
by other States. Consequently the whole of the
funds are consumed in attending to complaints of
cruelty, and checking cruel practices, within the city
and surburban limits. No matter how much it may
wish to do so the Society cannot go into the coun-
try and check even such cruelty as “Aneb” mentions.
That such cruelties as “Aneb” mentions are prac-
tised in the country is not at all improbable. Three
members of the Society only a short time ago
visited the Abattoirs and noticed a number of very
similar practices, and representations were made to
the Board in connection therewith. Prosecutions are
contemplated in order to prevent a recurrence, if
possible.
The Society would like “Aneb” and any other
readers who are sufficiently interested in the work
to communicate with the Society at its office, Post
Office Chambers, Sydney, and they will be convinced
that it is not dead, as suggested, but very much
alive. Unfortunately its objects only appeal to the
minority. The majority think that anything is
good enough for an animal, as long as it does its
assigned work and provides them with money.
And I am sorry that there are many even of the
minority who do not help us by becoming members.
“T.F.M.” collects the evidence: —
Who discovered King Island? The opinion most pre-
valent amongst our historical moles is that it was
Captain Black, of the brig Harbinger—the first
craft to sail through Bass Strait from west to
east. Baudin, the skipper of Le Geographe, also
lodged a claim, but it was promptly scuttled by
Governor King, who asserted that “the island was
first discovered by Mr. Reid in the Marthar (sic)
in 1798; afterwards seen by Mr. Black in the Har-
binger, and surveyed by Mr. Runav in 1802.” In
the latest of Fredk. Watson’s “Records” still
another claimant d rops anchor —Captain William
Campbell, of the brig Harrington. That hooker,
while lying in Farm Cove in 1807, was seized and
carried to sea by a gang of convicts, and in peti-
tioning the Home authorities to compensate him
for the loss of his ship, Campbell incidentally stated
he had “arrived in Port Jackson first in the Dept-
ford in 1797, in the Rebecca in 1799, and in the
Harrington in 1800, and was during that time
engaged in mercantile speculations in Basses
Streights; discovered King’s Island, and made other
useful discoveries in those seas.” It would, there-
fore, seem as if the question is still an open one.
In any case, Campbell and his brig were repeatedly
in the limelight in the infant days of N. S. Wales.
It was he who flouted the vice-regal order to “dress
ship” in honor of the French exploring vessels then
anchored in Neutral Bay, for the reason that, in
the eyes of a sturdy British sea-dog, the flag of his
nation was not displayed so conspicuously b.V the
Frenchies as it ought to have been. It was the
same Campbell who, after a trip to the South
American coast (in which he did a bit of privateer-
ing on his own account), brought to Port Jackson
the only tidings ever received as to the fate of
George Bass. Finally, after a stormy career afloat,
this ancient mariner dropped anchor on 2000 acres
of land in the Camden district, granted him by
Macquarie as a solatium for the seizure of his
brig, the which allotment is still known as Harring-
ton Park. A Sydney thoroughfare—in the Rocks
region—also acquired its name from Campbell's
everlasting hooker that finally became a farm.

Tablets -
Sensible women know that good health
cannot be found in a puff and powder box.
As health talks to women become more
general, both in the newspapers and on the
platform, the mass of women are begin-
ning to realise what the more cultivated
have always known, that good health
cannot be found in a powder box. The
externals of health may be obtained in
that way, but the basis of health lies deep-
er, and yet is just as easily obtained.
The most important thing that a woman
can do for herself, and about which she
is often most neglectful, is to watch the
condition of her stomach and bowels.
The weary eyes, the bad breath, the fre-
quent headaches, the pimples, the general
air of lassitude is nine times out of ten
the result of constipation or indigestion,
or both.
Many simple remedies can be obtained,
but the best in the estimation of most
women is Chamberlain’s Tablets for the
stomach and liver. They are mild, pleasant
to take and exactly suited to their needs.
If you want a medicine that will not
only act upon the liver, but have a
thoroughly safe effect upon the stomach,
and at the same time induce a natural
action of the bowels, take
"JoPinz’ Stomach o Liver.
bed with at night and get up with in the
morning—it is a sure sign that your sys-
tem is out of order. To refresh yourself
and regain that strong, vigorous feeling
you should take a course of Chamberlain’s
Tablets. They will strengthen your
stomach and stimulate your liver and
bowels to renewed activity; although you
have not realised it, it is these organs
that have caused that tired feeling. There
is no better medicine made for all dis-
orders of the stomach, liver and bowels
than Chamberlain’s Tablets.
The road to ruin begins when constipa-
tion and biliousness fasten themselves on
you and drag down your health. Cham-
berlain’s Tablets cure these disorders and
successfully build up your strength and
health.
Boils and pimples are Nature’s
effort to throw off poisons which have
formed in the blood. Chamberlain’s Tab-
lets cleanse the stomach, liver and bowels,
thus purifying the blood and refreshing
the system until you feel a new being.
Take a course of Chamberlain’s Tablets
to thoroughly eradicate the poisonous mat-
ter from the system and then make a
practice of taking one at regular intervals,
and you will never again be troubled with
boils.
It is a folly for old folks to allow the
bowel debility of age to master them, as it
naturally makes them age faster each day.
By using Chamberlain’s Tablets, safe and
pleasant relief can always be had. There
is no griping.
Chamberlain’s Tablets will clear the
sour stomach, sweeten the breath and
create a healthy appetite. They promote
the flow of gastric juice, thereby inducing
good digestion.
Supremacy is due to the “ Practice ’
which “makes perfect”—directed
for 35 years to the attainment
of ideal saddle-comfort.

Though a few “Live to eat,” the great
majority “Bat to live,” but when your
digestion is faulty, eating causes your life
to be a misery. To properly nourish your
body your food must be thoroughly digested
and its various constituents pass to the
organs for which they are intended.
When this is not done the food does you
no good, but rather harm, for it lies in
your stomach, causing poisonous gases
and disorders of the stomach—causes con-
stipation, which means that the food, in-
stead of being expelled through the bowels,
lies there, and the poisonous matter is
absorbed into the system. All this can
be avoided by taking a course of Cham-
berlain’s Tablets. They aid digestion,
cleanse the stomach, stimulate the liver
and bowels to perform their work, and in-
vigorate the system in so doing. Cham-
berlain’s Tablets are the safest Cathartic
to take, for they perform their work so
gently and naturally that there is no fear
of inflammation following.
No one thing is more conducive to good
health than the daily evacuation of the
bowels. If your habit is not regular in
this respect you need a general laxative
and tonic, and this is precisely what you
get when you buy an eighteenpenny box
of Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach
and liver. They eliminate all impurities
and tone the system at the same time.
A disordered stomach may cause no end
of trouble. When the stomach fails to
perform its functions the bowels become
deranged, the liver and kidneys congested,
causing numerous diseases, the most fatal
of which are painless and therefore the
more to be dreaded. The important thing
is to restore the stomach and liver to a
healthy condition, and for this purpose
no better preparation can be used than
Chamberlain’s Tablets.
If you were able to live just right all
the time there would be little need
for medicine, less need for doctors. But
some little thing is constantly coming
along to put us out of balance—exposure,
change of diet or drinking water, irregu-
lar meals are little things that will at
times upset the best of us. Nothing
particular the matter, but we don’t feel
good. At such times the wise among us
will take a few doses of Chamberlain’s
Tablets with certain knowledge that they
will put us right, right away.
Many women habitually suffer from
headaches which make life a daily purga-
tory. Frequently they are caused by in-
digestion, and to relieve them permanently
you must remove the cause. For indi-
gestion, biliousness, constipation, disorders
of the stomach and liver there is nothing
better than Chamberlain’s Tablets. Head-
ache cannot exist when Chamberlain’s
Tablets are taken.
Back up a sewer and you will poison
the whole neighborhood, clog up the liver
and bowels and your system is full of
undigested food, which sours and fer-
ments —this means indigestion, headache,
bad breath, yellow skin and everything
that is horrible. Chamberlain’s Tablets
quickly stop fermentation in the stomach,
and they make the liver lively, tone up
the bowels and set the whole machinery
going.
Much ill-health is due to impaired diges-
tion. If the stomach fails to perform its
functions the whole system becomes de-
ranged. A few doses of Chamberlain’s
Tablets is all you need. They will
strengthen your digestion, stimulate your
liver and regulate your bowels, entirely
removing that miserable feeling due to
faulty digestion. Chamberlain’s Tablets
have relieved many people who have been
acute sufferers from indigestion, so why.
not give them a chance to relieve you?
It is not natural to have that tired feel-
ing day in and day out, that you go to

For functional nerve trouble of every kind—from

It is common knowledge that Phosphorus is “good for the nerves,” but few people realise that in
addition, it is of enormous importance in all bodily (unctions. VITAFER combines Organic
Phosphorus in its three essential forms, with the entire protein of finest British milk.
In protein alone, one part of VITAFER equals six parts of meat, and moreover, the Vitafer
protein is in a form which weak digestive systems can easily assimilate.
N.B.—The moderate price places it within the reach of all.
Sold in Tins by all Chemists, 4 02., 8 02., and 16 02.
Prices, 35., 55., and 9s.
VITAFER is produced entirely by SOUTHALL

Firm of high repute. (Founded 1820.) All the
processes of VITAFER manufacture are carried

“Pen”: Sydney pressmen have been sup-
plied with a new brand of police pass, which
authorises them “to enter public arenas or
lines held by the police,” and instructs the
particular member of the force to whom it
is produced that the pressman “should be
afforded every reasonable assistance in the
discharge of his duties.” One whisky-stunned
Wayfarer put an unexpected strain on this
last-clause the other night by thrusting his
pass beneath a busy Hop’s nose and demand-
ing reasonable assistance to get home. The
Hop deposited him gently on the right tram
and warned the conductor to see that he was
safely delivered at the right corner. Then
he winked at the motor-man and went back
to point duty.

“Pen”: It happened to Bendigo (Vic.)
Advertiser some years ago. I did a ser-
mon in which the Darson talked about the
Twelve Apostles. Someone else wrote up a
rifle match. Next day’s ’Tiser said “The
Twelve Apostles went to Echuca and fired a
match against the local team. The scores
were”
* * * *
“Murkah” : What looks like sheer cussed-
ness soon settled the Navy Department’s
progressive move in broadcasting a press
service to ships at sea. The private enter-
prise which runs Australia’s mercantile
wireless issued instructions, so a ship’s
operator tells me, that the “press” messages
sent out by the Commonwealth stations
were not to be copied. He could offer no
reason for this surprising order. But the
motive can’t be economy, for the slip of
paper the stuff is written on would be the
only expense.
From that old money-spinner, the S. M.
Herald :
Many happy returns of the day to Mrs. So-and-so,
late of The Oaks and Camden. Your loving son,
Joseph, of Such-and-Such, Strathfield.
Joseph Reserves a bonus; a Birthday Greet-
ing column, if it caught on, might burst the
cash register in the front office.
“ Javon”: Sam Saunders, the editor who
made the Lyttleton Times the biggest
Radical force in Maoriland, has given up his
job of Liberal organising, and is now on
the staff of the Referee, the sporting section
of the Weekly Press —relative of the Press
which Saunders out-generalled for 20 years.

The boys of the 3rd Divisional team,
lately in training at Salisbury Plain (Eng.),
have brought out the second number of their
paper, Astra, the first of tvhich was
hatched in Melbourne. The 32-page three-
penn’orth was sold out —1000 copies—in a
day. Young Schuler, son of Melbourne
Age’s editor, runs the literary side, and
Daryl Lindsay, brother of Norman, the
pictures.
“Chevron”: Dave Low’s exemption from
military service on the ground of his greater
value to the nation as a cartoonist is, in one
way, a pity. It robs his colleagues of the
opportunity of presenting him with the fare-
well gift of an automatic, inscribed, “Fire,
Low, and lay them out!”
“St. Jimmy”: A very wild man of Gipps-
land advertises in a hurry:—
I hereby give notice that anyone interfering- with

The S. M. Herald, after attending a fire:

There’s no doubt about Bean’s reputation
with his countrymen at the Front, anyway.
Says a Ballarat boy writing home after the
dishing of the Hun at Pozieres:—
Captain Bean was there, so you may rely on
getting the facts. He is the onlv “dinkum oil” news-
merchant. The flowery, dramatic, leg-pulling Eng-
lish correspondents write as if they depended largely
on the information supplied them by wounded men
at the bases back in England. We satisfy ourselves
time and again about their many inaccuracies. Cap-
tain Bean sees what he writes of, and writes just
what he sees.
A case of Bean and seen, evidently.
TELEGRAPH WIRES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Phantoms, snow-white, of close-packed Cumuli,
Float lazily across the lower air.
And, daubed with careless brush, the Autumn sky
In cold cerulean hue lies here and there
Like holes pierced in some tissue-paper orb.
So far, this verse meets with my best desires.
It must be what the editor requires.
Yet two things all the picturesque absorb;
They flaunt me till my anguished soul perspires:
Two overhanging telegraphic wires.
Here, where some brown leaves rustle in the blast,
A taint of rotting Nature haunts the air.
The haughty moon serenely wanders past
Across the lake; with calm, unending stare,
The passive planets in the background gleam.
The night has come, and still I make this rhyme.
Two verses only written by this time.
For if I glance above to catch a theme,
The simile, that Heaven alone inspires,
Gets tangled in those telegraphic wires.
The misty drapings in the valleys fade.
The virgin, Morn, climbs softly o’er the East,
Naked and blushing; then prude Night, dismayed,
Slinks from the sight on which his eyes should
feast.
See how the sky....
I raise my thoughtless eyes
And lose the theme. I tear my uncombed hair,
And fling these tortured verses through the air.
Perdition damn the hands that placed them there,
Those scornful, mocking wires that grin and stare —■
Picking my verses from some prickly-pear.
I turn for home, and thus soliloquise ;
While in the mood what lyrics rich and rare
I might have made if I had found some pliers,
And, climbing, cut those two distracting wires!
s.a.

/ Correct \
Feeding of
k Infants A
NO attempt to provide a
correct system for the
progressive feeding of
Infants was ever successfully
carried out until the ‘Allen-
burys’ series of Infants’ Foods
were introduced. So successful
have the ‘Allenburys’ Foods
Nos. I, 2 and 3 proved, that
whenever a child is denied the
privilege of the mother’s milk
* they are indispensable. Gratifying evidence
of their remarkable value in the feeding
of infants from birth is constantly coming
to hand. The following is a copy of one
of many such voluntary letters received
from Medical Men, Nurses and Parents
resident in nearly all parts of the world.
A NURSE WRITES:
“I am pleased to say I have used your Foods 1,2 and 3 for the
last twenty years and have found none better. The
most delicate baby ever born I nursed and reared on the
Foods until he was 3 years old, and now he is 18 YEARS, and
a strong healthy boy nearly 6 leet high and as rosy as an
apple. You can make whatever use you like of this as I
should like your Foods and other things to be more used in
future, as Instead of making fat alone they make
bone and muscle, which is what children need.
(Signed) NURSE DAVIE.
The practical results from a continually extending use of the
‘Allenburys’ Foods, prove beyond doubt that children thrive excep-
tionally well on them. Such children are healthy and well grown ; the
flesh is firm, without excess of fat and the formation of bone is solid.

II Hi!
Workers All Use REXONA
Round the Tram Sheds, the Work Shops, on the Wharves, and at the
Factories, you will hear all the boys say: “Rexona is the best Remedy in
the whole country. We always use it.”
All these healthy lads know what they are talking about. They live a
strenuous life, and always wish to be in fit condition; but bruises,
abrasions, cuts and hurts are bound to come their way, in the natural
course of events, and it is when these occur that they prove the worth
of Rexona, the Rapid Healer.
REXONA Everyone’s Friend.
There are so many uses for Rexona that everyone is using it now. One day it
may be found useful for the minor hurts which are forever occurring in everyday
life, and another day it will prove invaluable for the more serious troubles, such
as Piles, Eczema and various forms of Skin Disorders. People in every class of life
use Rexona, from the highest to the lowest, and Rexona brings relief to all; so
get a 1/6 pot of Rexona to-day, and you will soon find it so useful that it will not
be long before you are getting the larger pots holding nearly four times the
quantity, for 3/-.

it being served too often. For “REX” CAMP PIE is a favorite with all
the folks from Father down to tiny Tim —even Mother likes her share of it.
“REX” CAMP PIE is a great Summer Dish, an appetising, mouth-watering
concoction of specially-selected meats, which are cooked, minced, seasoned
and packed in stiff jelly in a way known only to the "Rex” Chefs.
The addition of a Beetroot or Lettuce Salad
makes Camp Pie a toothsome meal.

Strike or Lock-out?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ELSIE declared that she had been
locked out;
It is my firm opinion that she struck.
Let me explain what it was all about
And how the whole disturbance brought
me luck.
It was my custom five days in the week
To foster Elsie upon frosted creams,
To praise the peachy softness of her cheek
And let her soft hair interweave my
dreams;
To go with her afar by tram and boat
To hear the loud surf roll or soft waves
croon;
To sit on damp nights on my overcoat,
Or lounge on grass beneath a summer
moon;
To rush the crowded back-stalls’ foremost
row
To watch the actor-calves of men of mark;
Or breathe the close air of the picture show
And snatch a furtive kiss when all was
dark.
These things and more three patient years I
wrought,
Th& fetters of her smile I did not scorn.
The price of all the chocolates I bought
Might furnish a thin cottage at Cremorne.
For young love’s labor, like all other toil,
Provides the capital its boss requires,
And Elsie ’neath her dark hair’s glistening
coil
Was full of most expensive small desires.
(This is one way of looking at the case;
But whether Elsie was in my employ
Or I a servant to her lovely face
Was never entered in the books of joy.)
Our federation was a loose affair.
We could not strictly be called unionists,
Although she held a mortgage on my hair
And I had put some bangles on her wrists.
We frequently discussed a finger ring,
That costly link of a discarded chain;
But put the purchase off until the Spring
Or cash or something came our way again.
This was the state in which our courtship
stood
When Bill came down from Queensland
breathing beer,
Bearing a cheque so large, robust and rude
It filled my world with sounds of gurgling
cheer.
Twice with a malten spell about my soul
I broke my faith and let the evening pass,
Forgetful how bright lips took happy toll
Of joy and moonlight on suburban grass.
The third cool evening filled me with despair ;
I went with hurried steps and bold excuse,
But never sign of Elsie’s smile was there
Though every charm of sea and sky was
loose.
Sternly I held myself aloof from Bill.
I wrote a letter making all things clear.
I told her if she really loved me still
The special corner she would find me near.
The simple lies I had arranged to tell
Were growing stale and flat by half-past
eight;
Lower and lower my sad spirits fell,
And still I had to kick my heels and wait.
No Elsie came to soothe my heavy care,
My pink-striped waistcoat still remained to
let;
I plucked a bunch of sad, cold beer to wear
Against the aching of a raw regret.
I sought for Bill next day, but Bill was gone.
The world for many days was full of pain,
And then the pale and pleasant moonlight
shone
Upon the gentle winsomeness of Jane.
Ice-creams she loved, and every little star
Struck a clear gold out of her wavy hair.
The kisses that she spent on me were far
Sweeter than any Elsie had to spare.
For five or six rich evenings every week
I went with her abroad by train or boat,
And even when the skies began to leak
We sheltered ’neath the same old overcoat.
For one bright month as happy girl and boy
We taught delight her youngest charms to
spill,
And then, right in the middle of our joy,
We came on Elsie arm in arm with Bill!
Elsie declared that she had been locked out,
It is my firm opinion that she struck.
Bill thinks the question is involved in doubt,
But Jane agrees with me it brought me
luck.

CURSE O’ MOSES.
The Wraith of Gummy Gale.
[For The Bulletin.]
L AVERT’S pub stood across the gap
where the narrow macadamised road
swung sharply round an abrupt spur
of Wombat Range. On the verandah, in a
brown study, sat Davey Brammell, the
shearer. His head hung heavy, and he
looked like a lost sheep in a strange pad-
dock. He had knocked down his cheque,
and was now getting himself straight again
for the track.
Mick Rooney, an old shed acquaintance,
came plodding round the curve, and pre-
sently threw his swag down at the corner
of the building.
Davey was as glad as if Mick had been
his own brother. His pot-companions had
gone two days ago, and even the bummer
had left when he found that Davey was an
insolvent proposition. With the exception
of some carriers camped a mile down the
range, there was not a soul about the
place to talk with. Lavert had been a
jolly fellow, always willing for a rubber at
euchre, but when Davey had parted his last
“sprat,” Lavert left off playing cards. He
also left off talking. So Davey welcomed
Mick Rooney. They had a drink, wherefore
Lavert raked up a smile and started talking
again.
“I think I’ve seen you before,” he said,
leaning on the bar and beaming across at
the newcomer. “Wasn’t you pressin’ at
Toonbar one year?”
“I was—me an’ the Cockroach. That’s
a good few year ago now,” said Mick,
reflectively. “You must ’ave a surprisin’
good memory.”
“I don’t soon forget faces,” Lavert
returned.
“ ’Specially if they owe you a bob or
two,” added Mick.
No one who had once known him could
easily forget Mick. He was short and thick-
set, and wore a big nose dumped in the
middle, and a squint in one eye. Davey
was a giant beside him; but Davey had a
slouching gait and was slow and dull.
“I was havin’ a bit of a yarn with th’ old
girl round th’ corner,” Mick presently re-
sumed, as he thrust his glass back and wiped
his mouth with a sweep of his shirt-sleeve.
“Mother Donefly?” queried Lavert.
Mick nodded. “She tells me Gummy Gale,
th’ hatter, scragged himself in the old hut
somewhere about three year ago.”
“Aye! He went off his onion at the last,
an’ took a drop from the crossbeam.”
“Poor old Gummy! I didn’t think he’d
come ter that. He warn’t a bad sort, take
him all round. What did he pan out?”
“Tuppence. The yarn goes that he had
a pile stowed away somewhere, but I think
ic was only skite. They found nothing,
aDyhow—unless it was Mother Donelly.”
He laughed softly. “Did yer ever hear tell
of the ghost on the Wombat?” he asked.
“No!” said Mick, expectantly.
“The old woman used to go ev’ry evenin’
at dusk an’ squat down on a big rock on
the side of the range,” Lavert began.
“ ’Twas just below her place, an’ overlook-
in' the caboose where Gale hung out. There
she smoked her pipe—she was always fond
of her pipe, was Mother Donelly—an’ some-
times she’d jabber to herself for a hour or
more. Donelly, yer see, is always away
thimigh the week, workin’ on Toonbar; an’,
of course, she feels it a bit lonesome cooped
up there by herself. She an’ Gummy were
great friends while he lived. Used ter visit
one another reg’lar. Anyhow, he went off
his nanny an’ took the short cut across the
boundary. It was with her dog-chain he
done the trick, too. I remember the barney
she had with the bobby to get the chain
back. Well, after that it was a common
thing to see blokes come peltin’ round the
p’int there at night as if the Devil was after
’em.- They’d seen Gale’s ghost. It used to
amuse me. Most of ’em saw him sittin’ on
the rock, smokin’, as he used to at his own
door, an’ talkin’ in sepulchral tones; an’
some would see him rise up sudden-like, with
a deep-drawn sigh, an’ at times it was a
blood-curdlin’ groan, an’ glide away like a
shadder. Of course I knew it was Mother
Donelly herself, but they wouldn’t have it.
Not a bit of it. Ev’ry benighted son of a
gun that streaked round that corner swore
as it was Gale’s ghost an’ no other; an’
the yarn spread about till Wombat Range
got sich a bad name that no one but a total
stranger would come by there at night.
Even the drovers reckon that no mob of
cattle can be made ter camp within five
miles of it. It got about, you know, that
Gale had a bit of stuff planted somewhere
by his humpy, an’ that Mother Donelly got
on to it, an’ so the old chap can’t rest, an’
goes moanin’ round.”
* * # *
“Do you think Gummy’s swag’s still
buried at th’ humpy?” Davey asked Mick
when they were alone out on the verandah.
“I’ll stake me forty years’ gatherin’ on it,
providin’ as Mother Donelly ain’t been an’
nailed it. She was always a pryin’ old cat;
but, still, Gummy was fly enough for her—
an’ he was pretty close-fisted with it. So,
all an’ all considered, it must be there yet.”
“Mick, a haul like that would be a chuck
in now !” Davey exclaimed. He straightened
his back, with his hands on his knees, and
blinked at the road which the dead man’s
gold might save him from tramping.
“I’ll tell yer what I was thinkin’,” Mick
went on, with a quick side-glance towards
the door. “I don’t want his bloomin’ nabs
to get wind of it,” he added cautiously. “Is
there such a thing as a pick about, d’yer
know ?”
“There’s a couple leanin’ against the
horse-yard at th’ back,” said Davey.
“They’re not up ter much, but they’ll do for
what we want.”
* * * «
There was no moon that night, but still
it was not very dark. A cloudless sky
bedizened with countless stars rendered it
an easy matter, for one thing, to pick out
the squat form of Mrs. Donefly perched on
the rock above Gale’s humpy. She was
smoking, as usual, and enjoying the cool
night breeze that came in little puffs along
the range. Farther down the slope the
carriers’ fires glowed redly, while the jangle
of horse-bells came incessantly from the
surrounding timber. Nothing stirred about
the building, which stood in the shadow of
the hillside. The two men crept towards it,
hugging the slope to escape the owl-like
eyes of the woman.
The place was in ruins. Many of the
slabs had fallen in, leaving huge gaps in the
sides; and storm-winds had stripped half
the bark from the roof. Davey shuddered
as he looked in. He did not like the idea
of searching by night for a dead man’s
gold, however bravely he had spoken of his
willingness to do so. Every strange object
that eaught his eye gave him a shock. He
was suffering from the effects of his two
weeks’ spree, and his mind was in a fit
condition to conceive a semblance of the
uncanny in the most commonplace objects

-EVERY-DAY
ACCIDENTS-
Sores and Festering Cuts
Promptly Healed by Zam-Buk.
MR. EDWARD SULLIVAN,
47 Victoria Avenue, Albert
Park, Melbourne, writes:—
“I am constantly getting
my hands torn and cut with nails
and hoop-iron at my daily work.
However, as soon as I get home
at night I just rub a little Zam-
Buk on the injured places, and
they are soon healed.
“On one occasion my hand
got poisoned and became' very
swollen. Festering set in,
and the injury was dreadfully
painful. It was a matter of the
greatest difficulty to do any work,
but Zam-Buk gave rapid relief.
Not only did it allay the irritation.

but Zam-Buk also took away the festering and then perfectly healed my
hand.
“I suffered greatly from a poisoned face, the cause of which I do not
really know. My face swelled enormously, and was much inflamed and
extremely painful. Zam-Buk was most cooling, reduced the inflamma-
tion and drew out the poison and healed my complaint very quickly.
“When working at case-making I came in contact with a nail which
inflicted a nasty gash on the abdomen. The place was most awkward
and painful, but Zam-Buk also healed this in the same rapid manner.”

about him. Rooney, though disliking the
neighborhood, was intent on business.
They began a systematic search for the
miser’s hoard, starting at the door and
working outward with the pick-point, one
to the left, the other to the right. Rooney
thought the money would be wrapped in
cloth or bagging, which would be easily felt
with the pick.
Hours they toiled, till the whole surface
was broken up for several feet around the
humpy. Every boulder in the vicinity was
overturned and the ground well probed
where it had lain. But nothing was dis-
covered.
‘‘Looks like huntin’ for a mare’s nest,”
whispered Davey, leaning wearily on his
pick.
“Don’t give in yet,” said his mate, though
he, too, began to lose hope. “We’ll try in-
side. I don’t like th’ thought o’ missin’ it.”
They had broken up half the caked floor
in their search, when a rustling outside
caused Davey to look round sharply.
“My Gawd!” he gasped the next instant,
and the pick dropped from his nerveless
nands.
“What’s up?” whispered Mick, “’Ave yer
found it?”
“Look ! Look !” whispered Davey, hoarsely.
“Wha —what’s that?”
Shuffling along the grass was a tall white
object that seemed to be sniffing and scratch-
ing at the broken ground. It resembled a
man lifting himself along on his hams while
the rustle of its snow-white garments
sounded strangely weird. Even its breathing
they could hear —deep breathing that made
them shudder. The clink of a chain sounded
clearly with every movement, and their hair
bristled at the recollection that it was with
.a dog-chain that Gale hanged himself. Sud-
denly the apparition rose up from the
ground and stood waying its white arms as
though beating off an invisible foe.
“My oath !” gasped Davey, as he clutched
the back of Rooney’s shirt and goggled across
his shoulder. “It’s Gale’s ghost!”
“Lemme go, you fool!” whispered Rooney,
tearing his shirt free and retreating cau-
tiously towards the door. He shook a totter-
ing fist at the outsider. Its arms and body
were clothed in a long white robe, and on its
head was a fantastic covering that did not
look unlike a white frilled bonnet.
With trembling knees the treasure-hunters
crept to the doorway. Rooney’s elbows dug
viciously into the other man’s ribs, and grip-
ping his pick in his hands he darted from
the hut and rushed wildly along the hill.
After him, gasping in abject terror, stag-
gered Davey, breathing like the dry pant of
a knocked-up dog.
Almost immediately they heard a bump,
bump, and the rattle of chains behind them.
Lasting terrified glances over their shoulders
they saw the Thing flying through the air
with a great flutter of white. Now and again
it would bump the earth hard, as though
gambolling in its glee. Then it would leap
into the air again, its arms waving and its
white robes flowing. Such peculiar antics
demoralised the two fossickers. Their pace
dwindled to a tottering walk, and they called
u on high Heaven to aid them and beckoned
h. orically to the saints.
As they neared the turn of the road Davey
C(ihapsed and fell disconnectedly against a
bush. The white pursuer flew past him with
a jingle of chains that sounded like a death-
rattle, and the next moment he saw it clutch
Mick by the back of the shirt and jerk him
to a standstill. Then he knew that click’s
soul was demanded of him. A howl came
from the victim. He struggled fiercely for a
few seconds. Then Davey saw him lift the
pick and send it with a wild drive, into his
ghostly assailant. He expected to see the
weapon cleave it as though it were empty
air; but it plunked hard and deep into a
solid body, and with a lamentable disarrange-
ment of sounds the creature toppled over add
lay in a death-agony on the road. Rooney
sank down on the bank, bathed in cold
perspiration.
Davey, with a new fear gripping his heart,
scrambled to his feet and beating wide of the
dying phantom, dropped down exhausted.
“Mick, you’ve done it!” he cried.
“Done what?” panted Mick.
Davey groaned in agony. “You’ve done
it,” he repeated.
“Yer spifflicated puffin’ adder, what ’ave I
done?” demanded Mick.
Davey pointed an agitated finger at the
unknown. “You’ve done murder !”
Rooney turned cold.
“You gibberin’ idiot, what yer say it was
a ghost for!” he wailed in an agony of
remorse.
The victim’s struggles had ceased, and it
lay a still white blot on the road.
“O Gawd, what are we ter do? You’ve
done murder!” Davey reiterated in the tone
of one half-demented.
Rooney turned on him fiercely. “Shut yer
fool mouth, yer idiotic —gorilla !” he hissed,
his squint eye fairly scintillating. “There’s
only one thing ter do—roll up an’ clear out
of this. Get a move on yer, quick !”
He hurried down to his camp with the big
man panting at his heels Never before had
their swags been bundled together and rolled
up in such a slipshod manner. In ten
minutes, with their boots in their hands, and
strips of torn shirt wrapped round their feet
to bamboozle the trackers, they were striding
across country with their faces set doggedly
to the western sky.
“We’ll ’ave ter travel all night, an’ spell
all day for the fust week.” panted Mick,
pulling up for a breath after five miles’
strenuous flight. Davey was too exhausted
to speak just then. “Must ’ave been one
o’ them pumplcin-’eaded carriers actin’ th’
goat,” Mick continued, wiping the perspira-
tion from his forehead.
“But the jiggered thing was flyin’!” Davey
argued.
He clutched his swag again, and they went
on, onward and westward into the solitudes
of the Never-Never, until the phantom police
and the spectral trackers were outwitted and
beaten.
Towards noon the next day Mrs. Donelly
came waddling up to Lavert's. She was
mumbling, and when Lavert came out she
pointed down the road with her stick.
“What d’yer think o’ them carriers that
cleared out this mornin’?” she cried with a
vicious ring in her voice.
“What have they been doin’?” asked
Lavert.
She planted the stick hard on the ground
before her, and folded her hands on the
nob.
“They killed Barney O’Bryan larst night,
an’ left him lyin’ stiff an’ dead on th’ road
at th’ p’int there. That’s what they did, the
dogs!”
“What for?” asked Lavert.
“What for?” Mrs. Donelly snorted. “’Cos
they’re a lot o’ curs. They tuk Donelly’s
white shirt an’ me own Sunday bonnet off
th’ line an’ put ’em on Barney, an’ then
they untied his chain —I tied him up at sun-
down —an’ they tuk him down to the road
there an’ kilt him as dead as a door-nail be
drivin’ a pick through his soul-case. Th’
dogs, they did!”
“What ad— shame!” said Lavert. “They
want six months.”
“Gaolin’s too good for th’ likes o’ them,”
Mrs. Donelly declared. “They want rollin’
in a spiked cask down Wombat. Brutes
like them, as would steal a lone woman’s
kangaroo for no other reason but to take it
away an’ stoom it out with a pick, ought to
be hounded off th’ roads, so they ought. I
want you now, Lavert, to come an’ help me
carry him to th’ cemetery.”
Lavert got his hat and they buried Barney
O’Bryan by the side of Gummy Gale.
With the return of the teams they learnt
that it was the carriers’ boys who had
dressed Barney and let him go, what time
the old woman was having her evening
smoke on the rock. But it was not till
years afterwards that they learnt how
Barney had met his death. The story was
told by a harmless crank who had a squint
in one eye and a broken nose.

[For The Bulletin.]
“%V' OU have come!” he said, in a voice
| of sombre triumph.
He let his pen fall on the last will
and testament which he had been carefully
preparing so that his friends might know that
he had nothing but debts to leave, and sprang
towards her. He seized her hands and gazed
rapturously at her.
“I knew you would come!” he said, in a
voice of tense passion. “I never doubted
you! And you have come in all your beauty,
robed resplendently, to do this thing with
me.”
“Oh, this is only my old dress,” she said,
with a derogatory indication of the sheeny
thing that hardly deserved such a compre-
hensive name. “My dressmaker won’t have
my new one till to-morrow. Then”
“Then,” he cried exultantly—“then it will
be all over!”
“I should hope so,” she said brightly. “I
shouldn’t like it to take any longer.”
“No ;do not be afraid ! And you are quite
ready?”
“Ready? I should say so. I’m as hungry
as a hunter; and, knowing you’d have some-
thing good, I didn’t have any four-o’clock.”
He looked at her blankly, and then walked
stagily to the table, picking up a small packet
that lay beside two glasses and a wine bottle.
“May,” he said intensely, “I know your
laughing spirit, your tendency to treat every-
thing as a jest, and that makes me feel all
the more the glory of this thing: that you
should leave the brightness of life and come
to me—for this! Yet is it.not too serious a
thing to make a joke of?”
“It is not a joke to be as hungry as I am!”
she replied lightly.
“I should have told you about my position
before. I am not well-to-do as I have seemed
to be,” he said, approaching and putting his
arms passionately about her. “I am a ruined
man, with bankruptcy and no hope of a cer-
tificate before me, nothing but debts around
me, and a time-payment carpet for which
the enraged t.p. people will call to-morrow
under my feet. What we have hoped for
'can never be ; and I dared not believe that
you were prepared to face the end with me.
Yet, you have come. Your love was greater
than I thought; and the knowledge of our
mutual love will satisfy us in the deed we
are doing.”
The speech was delivered really well; * yet
she withdrew from his embrace and shrank
away.
“Haven’t you any money?” she asked
blankly.
“What does money matter?” he cried,
again approaching her. “This little packet
will release us from all the circumstances
that make money imperative. But I shall
never forget if I live till —for half an hour,
that you came to me when I asked you to
die with me!”
“To what?” she c-ried in a sort of shriek.
“To die with me,” he repeated.
She looked frightened, but quickly became
more composed.
“I wouldn’t die with any man !” she pro-
tested with some heat. '“You asked me in
your letter” —- —
“To die with me,” he said solemnly.
“You didn’t!” she cried. “You didn’t!
I wouldn’t have come! Now, I suppose I’ll
have to go home again! What a ridiculous
thing ! Die with you !”
He had fallen back from her, something
like disillusionment on his face.
“I asked you to come here, to-night, at
half-past six, and die with me,” he said.
“You didn’t!” she screamed. “Your let-
ter distinctly said 'dine.’ ”
“Then you are not prepared?” he began
dully.
“I am prepared for dinner.” she said
eagerly. Then her spirits dropped again
before his dark looks. “And I’ll have missed
it at home,” she added with a muffled sob.
With a subdued curse the man turned to
see if the clerk had left any coins in the
petty-cash box.

Makes your milk pails look like silver
Bon Ami is made of a soft,
white, crumbly mineral —
softer than ordinary scour-
ing soap, so it will not
scratch.
Its biggest field is for mir-
rors and windows, but it is
also wonderful for pol-
ished metals.
*X §r all tfce
Fmer Kinds of
Polishing&Cleaning
It contains no acid or poison
or oil so it is perfectly safe
to use on milk pails. You
have no idea how brilliant
your milk pails can shine
until you try Bon Ami on
them.
Ordinary scouring soap will
scratch polished tin and
make it harder to clean
the next time, but Bon Ami
keeps the original, easy-rto-
clean, smooth, unscratched
surface.
