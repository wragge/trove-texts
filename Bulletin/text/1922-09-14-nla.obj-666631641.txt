LL through the week you
are besieged with men who
want to use your time to
their advantage. They have many
reasons why you should do some-
thing that will be of service to
them.
And only once in a long time does a man
come who has an idea for you; who can make
a suggestion based on the experience of some-
one else whose problem was similar to yours;
who takes as much satisfaction in talking about
your interests as most men take in talking of
their own.
You welcome such a friend; no man can
have too many. Hence we feel a satisfaction
in being able to add a man of that kind to
your acquaintance.
We would like to have you meet and know
the representative of the Alexander Hamilton
Institute in your vicinity.
As a lawyer becomes a better counsellor
day by day through his experience with the
problems of each new client, so the Institute
man grows in value to his friends, as man after
man discusses frankly with him the special
problems and opportunities of his own life
and business.
750 Business Conferences a Day
Day in and day out, in all parts of the
world, the representatives of the Institute are
in personal conference with at least 750 busi-
ness men in every sort of business.
Men confide in them problems that ordi-
narily would not be discussed outside the
family circle.
“I have been five years in this job and
seem to make no progress,” one will say.
‘‘What would you do in a situation like mine?”
And because the Institute man has known
other men in similar situations, he is able to
give an answer based, not on theory, but fact.
“How can I get into business for
myself?”
Many men ask that question. Too often
they think the answer is merely a matter of
capital, or of finding a partner, or of being
sure of so much patronage.
And the Institute man is able to point out
that the reason so many business ventures fail
is because the men at the head have been
departmental men and know only their own
part in the problem of successful organisation.
Selling, accounting, corporation finance,
factory and office management, transportation,
advertising, merchandising—each of these is a
link in the chain. And many a chain that is
otherwise strong breaks because one link is
weak.
The representative of the Institute never
intrudes; he never attempts to exert pressure.
Every day applications for enrolment in the
Modern Business Course and Service are
refused to men who, in the opinion of the
Institute s representative, are not equipped to
profit by it.
You Cannot Impose on Him.
Among all the business men in your
vicinity the Institute man is unique in this—
he can only succeed as you are more successful.
He literally has no interests that are apart from
your interests.
Copyright 1920, Alexander Hamilton Institute.
He has at his command all the research
facilities of the Institute. Do not hesitate to
call on him for any reasonable service. He
represents an institution that owes its whole
growth and prosperity to the growth and
prosperity of the thousands of men whom it
has enrolled.
You have probably read some of the
many advertisements of the Alexander
Hamilton Institute in the leading magazines;
and perhaps you have heard, through acquaint-
ances, of the Institute representatives and their
willingness to serve. But do you know what
it is these men represent? Have you ever
asked yourself, “What is the Alexander
Hamilton Institute—what will it do for me?”
“Forging Ahead in Business.”
There is a 1 16-page book, published by
the Institute, just to answer such questions. It
tells what the Institute has done for thousands
of successful men, and what it can do for you.
It is a book which should be in every
thoughtful business man’s library, and it will
be sent without obligation. Just fill out the
coupon below and mail it.

Can Europe Survive?
“Balkanisetl Europe,” by Paul Scott Mowrer.
(E. P. Dutton <£- Co., 'New York.)
On January 1, IS7T, a young Chicago
journalist, Melville E. Stone, and an Eng-
lish “remittance” man, Percy Meggy, who
afterwards became a prominent figure in Aus-
tralian Labor politics, began the publi-
cation of the Chicago Daily News, the first
one-eent paper in Porkopolis. A feature
was to get and print all the., news, dc omni
re seibili et quibnsdam alii*. Under Victor
F. Lawson, who succeeded Meggy in the
partnership, and who, In BBSS, acquired
Stone’s interest, this policy was widely
expanded to cover the world, and to-day the
News has a foreign service unrivalled in the
U.S. It is not inappropriate that
lilt ilea nised Eit rope, a most valuable "con-
tribution to the study of contem-
porary history, should be from the pen
of one of the most able and cultured of Mr.
Lawson’s foreign staff —Paul Scott Mowrer.
It is a brilliant analysis of the political and
economic conditions that exist to-day in
Eastern Europe, a field which extends from
the Baltic to the zEgean, and from the Urals
to the Adriatic. It gains added value from
the fact that it is written by a journalist
who is a scholar and a profound student of
political science, and, in addition, an Ameri-
can. He is, therefore, able to discuss dis-
passionately and impartially that tangled
web of racial animosities which has been for
so long the nightmare of European diplomacy.
And he points his moral and adorns his tale
by shrewd asides to emphasise how important
it is to the people of the U.S. that they should
take an intelligent interest in European
affairs. It is unfortunate that a year
elapsed between the writing and the publica-
tion of the work, but in their main essentials
conditions have not altered in the area with
which the author deals, except to confirm the
tendencies which he notes.
Schoolboys must have been sadly distressed
to find that the Treaty of Versailles substi-
tuted for the pre-war eight States east of
the Rhine no fewer than 14 States, exclusive
of any which might rise from the Bolshevist
ruins of White Russia. The collapse of Turkey
and Austria-Hungary was a colossal victory
for the cartographers. In the early years
of this century the Balkans were regarded as
a nuisance, principally on account of the
inability of the ruling States to exercise effec-
tive authority over the various races which
they governed. News from the Balkans con-
sisted principally of racial riots and brigand-
age, varied by occasional sensations such as
the murder of a prominent statesman or a
massacre of Christians. The defeat of
Russia in Manchuria vitally affected the his-
tory of Eastern Europe, for it diverted that
country from its inarch to the Pacific,
and compelled it to resume its earlier
efforts to obtain an outlet, or at least
to control one, on the Mediterranean.
It is notable that, whilst Russia has
gone down in the war, the main tangible
result has been the establishment of Slav
supremacy in Eastern and Southern Europe.
The regeneration of Russia can be only a
matter of time, and when that occurs Pan-
Slavism will again become a definite Euro-
pean problem, so much the more difficult of
solution in that the Slav States of Poland,
Czeeho-Slovakia and Jugo-Slavia have been
created and extend from within a few miles
of the Baltic to the Adriatic. Further, the
future of France is bound up with Pan-
Slavism. Here we get the real explanation
of the new orientation of European politics,
which has been so strikingly evident at the
Genoa and London Conferences. Disequili-
brium is concomitant with disease, and the
upset of the balance of power means inter-
national trouble and, if continued, war. It
was the equivocal attitude of Britain in 1914
which caused the late war, for it created the
impression in the minds of the Kaisers that
Britain would remain neutral, to the advan-
tage of the Central Powers. The Treaty of
Versailles has created a new disequilibrium,
due to the increased influence and the strate-
gic control of Europe given to the Slavs. The
sentiment of race is the most cohesive force
of politics, not excepting religion. Onc-
tliird of the Slav race is located in Europe
outside Russia. Finally,' Pan-Slavism is
fundamentally anti-British and pro-French.
Where Europe meets Asia, separated by
the narrow waters of the Bosphorus, is one
of the two great traffic-centres of human
migration, and in the hinterland has been
created an inextricable medley of races, re-
licts of many migrations, amongst whom
clean-cut ethical or national borders are im-
possible. The Austro-Hungarian Empire—
lineal descendant of that Holy Roman Empire
which was neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an
Empire—was a conglomeration of peoples-
Slovaks, Slovenes, Serbs, Croats, Czechs,
Poles, Rutheniaqs, Italians, Moslems, Ger-
mans, Roumanians, Tyrolese, Bulgars, Mag-
yars and Jews —ruled with quite remarkable
success on the “Divide et im■pcra ,, principle.
War, as the Austrian Chancellor, Golu-
chowski, foretold to the writer 20
years ago, would mean dissolution, for
under its stress the bitterness of racial an-
tipathies would be strengthened into an irre-
sistible Irredentism. It requires imagination
to- produce anything original and pleasing,
and the Three Tired Old Men of Paris were
driven by circumstances which they could not
control. To win the war they had erected a
fabric of unrealities, which became their
Frankenstein. They broke up—their poli-
tical vows left them no alternative —-the
federation of Austria-Hungary, and in its
place set up in a region of hopelessly mixed
peoples, a cubist design of small States, poli-
tically backward, financially and economically
weak, covetous, afraid, swayed by passion
and manoeuvred by outside interests. O?
the five States carved out of Austria-Hungary
not one has a seaport of its own! Not one
contains less than seven different races, mutu-
ally antipathetic ! Each is disgruntled with
its neighbors and with the Powers,, and each
,t hough, with one or two exception's, financi-
ally embarrassed, if not bankrupt, is seeking
self-sufficiency in armaments and economies!
As a public nuisance to Europe the new order
is far worse than the old. A condition of
political anarchy has been extended from a
corner of Europe to cover more than half
the continent. Such a situation is prohibi-
tive of peace and provocative of war. Europe
is again dividing into an armed camp, the
eventual formations being France, Jugo-
slavia, Czeeho-Slovakia, the Baltic States
and Russia on the one side; with Britain,
Italy, Germany, Hungary, Austria and Rou-
mania on the other. In Paul Mowrer’s
opinion, and he should know, the future of
Britain is tied up with the future of Ger-
many, Central Europe and Russia. Until
these regions are economically resurgent there
can be no prosperity in Britain. Hence
Britain’s less minatory attitude on repara-
tions ; its advances to the Baltic States and
to Soviet Russia; its support of a Danubian
federation.
In reality, it is doubtful if there can be
any sound reconstruction of Europe on the
present basis. The political troubles of
Europe are not economic but psychological.
In spite of all their grumbles each of the
new States could pay its way, reparations
apart, out of its agricultural and .industrial
resources, if it would settle down to work,
as Czeeho-Slovakia has. No Continental
country has, or ever can have, a national
frontier which is also an economic frontier,
or vice versa. Even less can national,
economic and strategic frontiers coincide.
Political, economic and military issues have
ever been in conflict. Political sentiment again
and again over-rides economic or military rea-
son. Politics are psychology, and it was the
subordination, or lack of, psychological instinct
by the two Anglo-Saxons at Versailles which
has produced the present jumble in Europe.
They started the new world off with a grouch,
which rankles at every provocation, and is
fermented by intense nationalist propaganda
and militarism. In addition, the old bureau-
cracy, imperfect as it was, has been destroyed
and government is painfully inefficient and
costly.
Added to international jealousy and inter-
nal misgovernment is the menace of Bol-
shevism, either in the form of internal dis-
turbance or of external attack. Yet the
author of this book, who has had excellent
opportunities of judging, does not consider
that Bolshevism has come to stay. It may
evolve into a democratic republican form of
government, or into a Napoleonic militarism,
or be overthrown by force. But in its exist-
ing form it only lives by the Russian’s natu-
ral inclination to a contemplative life. In-
deed, it has already defeated its own object'
by the creation of a genuine middle-class.
The destruction of property has created the
sense of property: the establishment of com-
munism has destroyed communism: the
extinction of the aristocracy has awakened
the sentiment of individualism. “The world
does not progress; it only changes!” What-
ever the future of Bolshevism inside Russia,
it stands little chance of success outside that
country. The Buddhistic contemplation of
life stops at the frontier. The apathy of
Russia is replaced by virility of mind and
action, which could only be overcome b„y
superior military force. Invasion b,v Rus-
sian communism might well prove to be that
federating factor which is now urgently
needed in Europe.
Of all the new countries of Europe, Aus-
tria is that with the worst Prospects, due
in no small degree to the apathy of the
people. This tadpole State, a huge head,
Vienna, with a long tapering tail, is the
remnant left of Austria-Hungary, after
everyone had had his slice. Vienna, the
most cultural of all the European capitals,
has indeed fallen from its high estate. It
is clear that Austria cannot stand alone.
She must either federate with the "Irreden-
tist States, or unite with Germany, her
natural ally, but under the treaty a pro-
hibited one. Herein lies the cause of the
split between France and Italy. The latter
country lias common interest with Austria
and Germany as a protection against Jugo-
slavia, and would re-establish the Triple
Alliance. This would create a formidable
barrier between France and her Slav pro-
t£gbs. “Plus ca change, plus e’est le uieme
chose.” The old, bad world is still with us,
and in an aggravated form. The smoke of
one war has hardly blown aside when the
nations are lining up for the next. History
and homicide have truly been described as
interchangeable terms !
Henry Lawson
Henry Lawson is a phenomenon without
parallel in the history of literature. In his
close relation to the soil and to the sorrows
and joys of the very ordinary people of a
work-a-day world he had some far-off re-
semblance to Robert Burns, but the com-
parison is not a very close one. Burns was
the crown of achievement of a very long
line of singers of folk-gongs, which, though
generally inferior, were the same in kind
as his own; Lawson, on a practically virgin
soil, wrote both in prose and verse as no
one else had attempted to write. His work
has a good deal in common with that of
Rudyard Kipling—though some of the best
appeared before Kipling .was known —hut
while Kipling is nearly always the fine
observer from without, Lawson is nearly
always to be found within, identified with
the people of whom he writes, and looking
out upon a world that is not very sympa-
thetic. It is this which more than' any-
thing else gives him his emotional power.
As a verse-maker he was always a little
rugged; as a writer of prose he can hardly
he said to have acquired a style; yet in
both prose and verse he gripped the imagina-
tion and the feelings in a way that few
writers have ever done. He threw out
striking phrases as a fire throws out sparks,
and threw them out, not because he thought
of dazzling us, but because the great heat
within acting on the rugged material of his
work forced the sparks to fly. He labored
hard to get his verse into shape, often sub-
mitting three or four variations of the line
to his editors, but never missing or obscur-
ing the heart and centre of his song. In
prose he sometimes overloaded the telling of
a tale with digressions which were inclined
to confuse tlie reader ; but the climax found
hint with a full mastery of words as graphic
and well-chosen as those of the finest classic
model he had never read. Many of his

For Construction
and Destruction
HE
instrument of destruction seldom
operates also in the field of construction.
r l he Comox blowpipe is one of the rare ex-
ceptions. But its power of destruction is
benevolent. It acts only for the benefit of the
race—not against it.
Note this power of helpful destruction! A nation
decides to scrap a huge ship. Formerly, the labor of
tearing down was almost as great as that of building
up. To-day, the towering mass of steel feels the lick
of scores of fiery tongues. The flames of the oxy-
acetylene blowpipes quickly cut the plates and
beams and columns at the will of the director in the
minimum of time, at the minimum of cost.
As the agent of construction or ot repair, Comox plays its time-
saving, money-saving part. Nothing is too great or too small for
the healing action of its magic flame. From the union of giant
plates of battleship or huge building, down to the mending of the
insignif cant fracture of a household utensil, its value is recog-
nised daily more and more.
Though Comox operates in ship-yard and factory, in mine and
workshop, its power is nevertheless at the ready call of every
household. When any metal part is broken it can be repaired—
really made new again—by your neighbouring Comox Welder.
In his hand, Comox, for a few pence, will save you a replacement
cost of shillings—often of pounds.

Yesterday.
But yesterday I lived and laughed, and bid
Dull care a gay good-night.
To-day the sun of health and hope is hid
By clouds of pain. Its light
Is not for me. But, say,
The world seemed good to me, but yesterday.
I’ve laughed at chance, and scoffed at
danger’s frown
So long. And now, at last,
Old Fate has feinted, struck, and got me
down.
His blow has tied me fast
To this dull bed. The gay
Old life is done for me, since yesterday.
God ! For a seat upon a horse again.
The joy, the keen, glad thrill
Of pounding hooves upon a wind-swept plain,
A game colt lighting still.
These things were mine—the play
Of wrist on rein. God —give—me—yesterday !
The little imps of pain that torture me
May weary of their work,
Anon, and grim Misfortune prove to be
A gen’rous foe. I’ll shirk
My task no more, but pay
The price, and, smiling, dream —of yesterday.

In a Mountain Garden.
The year is weary and the earth is cold.
But one brave rose has heart to lift a head
Of clustered blossom, tinged with livelier
red
Than when the land was full of summer
gold.
Tossed in the chiller wind that makes them
bold,
Scarlet geranium banners gaily spread
About the sapless stems of flowers long
dead
With dancing in an air too sweet to hold.
Save for these narrow flames, the garden
waits
The shrill, warm trumpet of the marching
Spring,
In penury of beauty like to death.
But all the hill is green beyond the gates
And the great trees stand proudly wing
to wing.
Guarding one home against the tempest’s
breath.

The Bowed Foxgloves.
[Note. —It is an old wives’ tale that foxgloves have
“knowledge.” When a spirit passes, they know, and
bow their heads.]
The foxgloves bow their lilac heads to-night.
Although no leaf is shaken on the rose,
And no soft-singing wind steals by on light,
Quick steps, to woo the last-born bud* that
blows.
So still the day has gathered sunset up.
So still the red has gone, the dusk has
come,
The brown bee dreaming in the poppies’ cup,
Spills dust upon the cool delphinium.
Like cloistered nuns, pale-eyed, the scented
stocks
Kneel shrouded in the larkspur’s filmy blue.
The heaped-up, passionate, wan hollyhocks
.Wait dumbly for the stars to glimmer
through.
So still the flowers are, as though they slept
With soft, expectant faces, borne upright!
No laggard breeze among the bloom has
crept—•
But how the foxgloves bow their heads to-
night !
Oh, hush ! Some soul has passed a breath
ago!
But I-*>-I did not hear the death-bell ring!
Only the foxgloves in the garden know,
And droop their heads and move a-
murmuring!
What unloosed soul has winged its lonely
flight
Across the ocean of infinity?
Some spirit straight from youth, all radiant-
white,
To go while sap runs singing in the tree?
To go, dear God, when elm and lilac bud
And gorse thrusts out in flaming spikes of
gold!
Ah ! let me think it fled from one whose blood
Ran chill and slow, whose faded eyes were
old—
Not from the house of him whose eager feet
The stones of life had scarce begun to
know !
How sweet this purple dusk! Dear life, how
sweet!
Yet some winged soul has passed a breath
ago!
I cannot bear it if it were some child
Whose soul has fled the blazing white of
Spring,
While spangled paths among the grasses Wild
Invite bare feet to go a-wandering!
Some child who. dreaming ’neath a blue-
topped hill,
Looked out upon the edges of the world —
For whom the capeweed cups held gold to fill
Unto the brim, his little hand in-curled !
Who knows? I may have heard his shrill
young song
Float down the early morning clear and
mild,
Or glimpsed him bending where the cowslips
throng—•
I cannot bear it if it were some child !. . ..
Oh, think of this! One day some friend may
pass,
And see these drooping bells, and weep
to see.
And say: “They bow for one who loved the
grass
And shining trees and sun!” They’ll bow
for me!
VICTORIA.

A GOOD SCHEME GONE WRONG.
The Imperial emigration scheme, which re-
sulted from the Empire Settlement Act,
passed by the British Parliament last June,
is not panning out nearly as well as it
might. The idea, briefly, was to settle the
surplus hordes of Britain in the Do-
minions, all of which are in urgent need of
population. Both parties were to contribute
to the financing of the scheme. In Britain
unemployment is rampant; has been for over
a year; and will be for years to come, unless
the chaos in Europe, which appears likely to
increase rather than decrease, is straightened
out. (It cannot be straightened out until the
U.S.A., which holds the world’s gold, takes
a hand in the game; and it is to force this
that Russia and France are stalling every
conference which is called.) The un-
employment dole and the creation of
relief works, at a cost of £5 10s. per
man employed, are absorbing millions sterling
in every British budget, and even then sev-
eral million people are on the breadline.
The position is extraordinary, when it is
remembered that there is more money avail-
able for investment in industry in the U.lv.
to-day than at any time in history. But
who is going to invest money in industry to
produce goods that cannot be bought? Obvi-
ously, Colonel Amery’s inspiration came at
the opportune moment. “We have several
millions more people,” he said to himself,
and, later, to others, “than we want. The
Dominions badly need those millions. Err/o
we ship the millions overseas, populate the
empty spaces of the Empire, save ourselves
a colossal financial burden, re-galvanise our
industries into life, and strengthen the posi-
tion of the Dominions enormously.” And so
the Empire Settlement Act was born. Each
shipment of immigrants to Australia is
financed by loan. One-third, principal and
interest, falls on the Imperial Exchequer;
one-thud on the Commonwealth; and one-
third on the State. Theoretically, without
any doubt, Amery has got on to a thoroughly
sound idea. But just as Randolph
Churchill on a memorable occasion forgot
Goschen, so Amery lias forgotten the
Agents-General.
AH that these officials seem to have
realised was that Australia was being
offered real money, a commodity which
has not been coming freely to Austra-
lia for some time past. Directly the
plan was through they made a rush to slice
the melon. AVestralia got there first and
made a rattling good bargain. There is not
the slightest chance of the Sunset State ever
paying back the principal of its loan, and as
to the interest, Premier Mitchell pointed
out, in a burst of enthusiasm recently, that
there is no need to worry about that either.
An analysis of the figures shows that W.A.,
so far from paying a third of the interest, will
only have to fork out 2s. per immigrant
per annum, supposing the goods are delivered
as per manifest. W.A. gets 75,000 new arri-
vals, and pays only one-eighteenth part of the
annual loan service. The reason is simple ;
the Commonwealth shoulders one-third of the
loan and its annual service, and, in addition,
pays a per capita grant of 255. on each immi-
grant to AVestralia. (As the population of
X. S. AA r ales represents 40 per cent, of the
Commonwealth population, that State will
thus have the pleasure of paying 40 pet cent,
of the Commonwealth share of the loan
burden and of the capitation grant!) As
part of the loan is to be diverted to
Westralian public works, it will tickle the
N. S. AVales taxpayer immensely to know
that he must forego essential public works in
liis own State to provide those of his most-
distant fellow-countryman.
Even so, good reasons could be found for
the philanthropy of which N. S. AVales must
be guilty, nolens volens, if the plan works
out to schedule. For example, if N. S.
AVales now helps AVestralia, the latter when
the time comes will be called upon to recipro-
cate, though to a less degree. But the plan
is not proceeding according to schedule,
and for reasons which suggest that
Amery was not only forgetful, but
downright foolish. The Agents-General
and politicians, smelling easy-term loans,
seem to have assured him that the
British unemployed only had to arrive in
Australia to be fixed for life; and out they
a-e being sent. They get here and find
themselves sadly disillusioned, like the
R I G. men who have cabled from Adelaide
and Perth to London that Amery’s scheme
is no better than a swindle. In practice that
is just what it is, though the theory is excel-
lent, as theories often are. Of course
Amery- —a politician, though in other respects
with nothing serious against him—must
stand by his scheme, wherefore London and
provincial editors have been officially re-
quested “not to publish any information tend-
ing to discourage emigration, especially to
Australia.” And of course the Dominion
authorities are not going to disabuse the
public in Britain. They are in far too tight
a corner for cash to let n.ny opportunity of
getting some financial aid pass by untapped.
Australia pre-eminently needs population for
three very good reasons—defence, production
and finance. An empty space, especially a
fertile empty space, is a temptation,
and while to risk temptation is .not wrong,
it is at least inadvisable. Secondly, in-
tenser population means a greater' out-
put of primary products. Thirdly, more
population reduces the per capita burden of
debt and taxation. AVhat one man shall
creak his bones about, three men shall carry
upright. The skeleton of the Amery scheme
gives the solution of these three problems,
but a skeleton is not enough. Amery began
at the wrong end. He has made his first
object the ridding of Britain of its unem-
ployed, and, in so doing, has merely trans-
ferred the trouble to the Commonwealth and
the States. To get real results from his
brain-wave he should have first assured him-
self that Australia was prepared to receive
immigrants, or at the very least would pre-
pare against their arrival. The actual
position is that, whilst potentially there are
thousands of millions of acres to be popu-
lated, there are none ready to be populated;
and, broadly speaking, no efforts are being
made to prepare any of those acres. There
is a lot of talk, but talk does not wash
clothes or clear brush or irrigate land or
make roads.
* * * *
The chance of a lifetime is the lifetime of
the chance. Australia has got its oppor-
tunity to solve its most pressing and most
vital problems, but the opportunity is not
going to last for ever. Immigration is the
solution. But this country must do some-
thing for itself. Put quite plainly, one of
the world’s richest areas is well along the
path to bankruptcy, owing to the inefficiency
of its seven Governments and the lethargv
of its people. The Commonwealth and all
the States have to postpone vital works
because there is no money. The London
money market, bursting with funds ready
for investment, simply will not look at an
Australian Government loan. The days of
“poling on the old man” are drawing to a
close. The old man is locking his money-
bags safely away. If Australian credit is
to be re-established there must be a complete
reversal of Australia’s policy. The game
of asking for something for nothing
and getting it is played out. If Aus-
tralia wants credit, then there must
be some practical return. The immi-
gration scheme must be made a real
thing. It is not enough to land so many
hundreds of thousands of immigrants and
turn them loose to swell the ranks of the
unemployed. Land must be made available
for them, and proper facilities must be
provided so that the products of the land
can be marketed. The first essential thereto
is a widespread system of development roads
in every State. At present, wheat grown
more than 15 miles from a railway is un-
marketable, because the excessive cost of
transport kills the profit. There is a won-
derful opportunity of opening up large rural
areas, with good roads and motor transport.
The railways are a dead loss to the country
chiefly because over 90 per cent, of the
mileage there is insufficient traffic. There
can be no settlement of empty spaces until
there are roads, and the construction of these
is the most important of all the problems of
the country* Roads mean settlers; settlers
mean production ; production means traffic;
and traffic means, or should mean, profit.
Analysed right down, the future of Austra-
lia, of the "White Australia” ideal, of every-
thing worth while in the country, even the
jobs of the politicians, if they troubled to
think about it, depends on the success of
the immigration scheme, and the success of
the immigration scheme rests, in great part,
upon the comparatively cheap basis of roads.
A POOR OLD GAMBLE.
Under T. R. Bavin’s Lotteries and Art-
unions Bill, which got through the N. S.
Wales Assembly last week, tobacconists and
the like are forbidden to sell tickets in
‘"foreign” lotteries, and newspapers to adver-
tise them or announce the results. The maxi-
mum penalties for breach of this interdict,
which is aimed chiefly at Tattersall, of
Tasmania, and the Golden Casket crowd, in
Queensland, are ±2O in the case of an agent
and ±2OO in that of a newspaper, Bavin hav-
ing convinced himself, by some inscrutable
process of reasoning, that it is 10 times as
had to “print or publish any advertisement,
notice or information relating to a foreign
lottery,” from which the printer or publisher
may derive no financial benefit whatever, as
to sell tickets o.n commission in the loathly
thing. No doubt, the Bavins have a just
grievance in that vast sums earned in N. 8.
Wales drift uselessly to gambles in other
States. But it is ridiculous to suppose that
the outflow will be reduced to any extent by
prohibiting the publication of advertisements
and result-slips. That can only be done
by offering the public a better gamble than
Tattersall or the Golden Casket provides.
And Bavin’s Government is too ignorant of
human nature, or too fearful of the wowser
vote, to supply one. It can’t be too moral,
for part of its revenue is obtained from the
taxation of the betting machine and book-
makers’ tickets. Anyhow, when a Govern-
ment strikes at sweeps, by which no one is
destroyed, while conniving at and levying
tribute on the racecourse gambling which
rages like a pestilence, and which numbers
its ruined victims by the thousand, the less
it parades its morality the better.
* * * *
The obvious alternative to “consultations”
and the nefarious s.p. system is premium
bonds. Could the small speculator and syn-
dicate buy these bonds in the same way as
they purchase sweep tickets, Tattersall,
the Golden Casket, and the shop variety of
Me Rook would lose most of their customers.
The Tattersall people, who have been
thriving for 20 years on sterner measures
than Bavin’s, don’t publish statements of
their income and expenditure. Neither does
the army of bookmakers. But the Golden
Casketeers do, and their latest document
affords food for thought. The manager hav-
ing left somewhat hurriedly, pertinent ques-
tions were asked in Parliament, the Caskets
being under Government control. Jones,
the Minister of Mines, said that the gentle-
man had drawn three months’ salary in
advance, gone to Sydney without leave, and
stayed away for a week. For that reason
his appointment had been terminated. But
there was nothing wrong with the accounts.
In reply to an inquiry as to whether the
Government would arrange to have all prize-
tickets examined by (1) the Government
Printer, (2) a handwriting expert, and (3)
a chemist, Jones said that the Auditor-
General had inspected the books and ac-
counts, including vouchers and tickets, and
repeated his assurance that everything was
in order. Diving into details, he said that
±1,255,021 9s. 6d. was realised from the
sale of tickets in 46 Caskets (there is
approximately one a fortnight), the 7th to
the 52nd inclusive. Of this ±574,776 3s. 6d.
was returned in prizes. Expenses of man-
agement came to ±71,226 3s. 9d, Common-
wealth taxation to ±92,998 7s. 2d., and State
taxation (with two sweeps omitted) to
£57,381 19s. Od. The profits, distributed
and undistributed, totalled £464,829 2s. 4d.,
of which £145,863 19s. 3d., including interest,
remained in the Commonwealth Savings
Bank, and £318,965 3s. Id. had been placed
to the credit of Queensland hospitals, a bush-
nursing scheme, and the Mt. Mulligan relief
fund. That is as far as the statement went,
but it has since been announced that £78,625
of the amount at credit is to be paid over to
the hospitals.
* * * #
It is a profitable business for the hospitals,
but not much of a gamble for the subscribers.
On the Government’s own showing, those
who contributed to the 46 Gaskets got back
less than 45 per cent, of what they put into
the pool; and that is reckoning without post-
age (4d. on a ss. 3d. ticket), and the ex-
pense of buying money-orders and postal-
notes. The cost of dragging in their money,
exclusive of these unrevealed taxes (which
amounted to at least ±100,000) was nearly
6 per cent. And, inasmuch as there were
4,600,000 tickets in the 46 lotteries and only
30,958 prizes, it is obvious that the vast
majority got nothing for their pains. Yet,
had they subscribed £1,255,021 to a 5 per
cent, premium bond loan, per cent, being
paid in the ordinary way and the balance
in the form of prizes drawn by lot, not one
of them would have lost. Instead of a bundle
of worthless sweep-tickets each would now
possess a piece of Government paper entitl-
ing him to the pavment of interest at six-
pence in the £, and the return of his princi-
pal. plus a handsome bonus should he be
lucky in the periodical drawings (£31,375 10s.
would be available in the first year), which
would continue while there were bonds to be
redeemed. Also, the Government would have
the use of £1.255,021 for sinking-fund pur-
poses, or to meet loans falling due in Lon-
don, at a rate less than the cost of collecting
the sweep-money. Since all the administra-
tive work could be done by the Treasury and
the Government Savings Banks, there would
have been no necessity to hire a horde of com-
mission-agents, whose honesty has to be taken
for granted (and some of them are very
seedy persons), nor would the bondholders
have been mulcted of excessive postal fees.
Certainly, there would be no largesse for
hospitals under the premium-bond system,
but. then, it is the business of the Queens-
land taxnayer to support his hospitals. It
is regarded as a sacred duty in every well-
ordered State. To set aside the responsibili-
ties of citizenship, in this connection, and
depend upon getting the wherewithal for the
care of the sick from gamblers, mostly in
other States, was the work of the degraded
Theodore Government. It is not only a
count in the indictment against that Govern-
ment, but a blot on Queensland’s name.
THE SILK PURSE AND THE SOW’S
EAR.
Ever since 1911, when South Australia tied
that leaky tin-kettle, the Northern Terri-
tory, to the Corpmon wealth’s tail, the racket
arising from the connection has been re-
garded as a subject for mirth in some quar-
ters and for annoyance in others. The time
has now arrived, however, to do something
about the matter other than alternately grin
and argue over it. The present com-
plete stagnation of the Territory—unparal-
leled in Queensland and Western Australia,
which also have large tropical areas —can
be traced to primary causes. They are,
firstly, certain natural disadvantages, and,
secondly, the same in combination with
unfavorable State boundaries. In both
Queensland and Western Australia the sea-
board runs northward from more temperate
latitudes, so that, in the absence of intrud-
ing demarcations, their tropical parts, by a
kind of capillary attraction, share the gen-
eral progress. Compare this with the situa-
tion of the Northern Territory. Its seaboard
is disconnected, both by geographical angle
and by State boundaries on either side,* from
the southerly coastline. Its position over-
land is no better. It is separated from the
population of its parent State by the cen-
tral, and one of the driest, parts of Aus-
tralia, while east and west it adjoins the
worst, and most sparsely-inhabited, districts
of its two other neighboring States. Aus-
tralia's coastal fringe was settled first, of
course, because the original colonists came
from overseas. Settlement has persisted in
these regions because of the comparative
aridity of the interior. It has been marked,
too, by prior development of the southerly
regions as compared with the northerly and
more tropical districts. Consequently, the
comforts and conveniences which make life
more troublesome, but which everybody
wants, tend to disappear toward the interior,
and it has been the same as regards the
North.
The pastoral industry, confined practically
to horses and cattle, is the only one which
now shows any sign of thriving. Lack of
surface water is one obstacle. Difficulties
of communication and transport are others,
and they seriously affect both the obtaining
of supplies and the sending of cattle to
market. They affect all other activities just
as seriously. Take mining. There are
known to exist throughout the Territory pro-
positions which would pay handsomely in
more convenient places, but freight, often
possibly only by camel, and costing as much
as £4O a ton, precludes profitable working.
The Maranboy tin-field, for instance, is con-
veniently placed compared with other Ter-
ritory mining districts, being about 40 miles
from the Katherine railhead; yet cartage
to the Katherine costs something like £lO
a ton, and after that there are railage
charges to Darwin and a high freight on
shipment south. It is much the same
whether the point of arrival and departure
of inland freights is Darwin or Oodnadatta.
The results tire high costs and crude living.
The great pastoral holdings of the Terri-
tory represent an almost entirely non-resi-
dent ownership, and what little settlement
exists is characterised by an absence of
womenfolk. Progressive or even decent
pioneering is not attained in that way, par-
ticularly where there is a native black race!
Even at Darwin prices are high and house-
hold conditions are bad —they compare so
unfavorably with the ordinary conveniences
of towns in the progressive parts of Aus-
tralia that many married men stationed
there find it wiser to leave their wives and
families in the South. These facts explain
brieflv why the pastoral areas of the North-
ern Territory are not more fully stocked;
why its mining industry, suffering dispro-
portionately the depressed state of the metal
market, has totally collapsed ; why tropical
production is limited to an occasional pea-
nut unearthed at the Daly River; and how
it is that the Territory, under the Common-
wealth regime has exported nothing more
important than a batch of Darw’in officials
in 1919, and a whole shipload of unemployed
from the same spot when an almost excres-
cent meatworks closed down soon after-
wards.
Plainly, as things are, the development of
the Northern Territory cannot be expected
by the ordinary process of permeation. With
an area of over half-a-million square miles,
its European population is less than 3000.
and it has no economic basis for a political
identity of its own. Capitalist enterprise,
with its many talons, is not noted for missing
good chances. It has not been attracted by
the Territory. State aid has attempted to
take its place. Enormous sums of money
have oeen spent by the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment, and there is little to show for it—
except the bores put down along stock
routes, and these have not since been at-
tended to in a manner consistent with their
utility and with the original outlay. The
Commonwealth, on taking over the Terri-
tory, endeavored to revive mining, which, in
the earlier years of South Australian con-
trol, prospered to the extent of exhausting
the rich superficial deposits of a field or
two. Diamond-drilling and mineralogical
surveys -were extended, and batteries and
other plant erected, and a large amount was
paid out in subsidies to prospectors. Yet,
the latest published figures for a year’s out-
put show a value of less than half that of
any previous year since mining was seri-
ously undertaken. Agricultural production,
in spite of Commonwealth money spent lav-
ishly on experimental farms and stations,
has fared no better. Leases on the Daly
River were granted free for life to about
a dozen settlers, to whom substantia] ad-
vances were made for improvements and
stock. Half that number linger on, and their
production is negligible. There can be no
doubt that most of the money spent by the
Commonwealth was spent unwisely. And
there was far too much tomfoolery, with an


over-elaborated staff of civil servants at
Darwin.
The point of these remarks is that,
if, lacking the usual incentives of com-
mercialism, the only hope of developing
the Territory is in continuing to pick-
pocket the taxpayer, there is no sort
of guarantee that the dreary story of futile
extravagance will not be repeated. The
thing lends itself to all the various kinds of
departmental doddering and pandering and
pal-pushing that take place wherever
there are public jobs going. The only
hope seems to be in the construction
of the North-South railway, in fulfil-
ment of the vague agreement with South
Australia when the Territory was taken
over. Nothing else offers any pros-
pect of relieving the present disadvan-
tages of the place. In the meantime, expen-
diture in other ways should have regard
merely to existing interests. First, let a
careful decision be made as to whether the
outlook warrants the undertaking. What
with Commissions of one kind and another
enough evidence has surely been collected!
And then will arise the problem of labor,
which, if serious in rural districts elsewhere,
is likely ,to be much more so here. The idea
of colored labor has always been based on
the understanding that there shall be un-
limited supplies of it, with very little re-
sponsibility towards it on the part of the
employer. Consequently it takes no account
of discomfort. But white men of the right
stamp (the Territory has more than its share
of derelicts) are not likely to venture on
hazardous pioneering in the North if they
and their families can be more comfortable
and just as well off in the South. If there
is no prospect of permanently settling the
Northern Territory with such people, more
would be lost than gained in the long run
by introducing the veiled slavery of black
labor. So the root of the problem consists
in making the Territory at least as comfort-
able and as cheap for the white man as
India or Ceylon or any of the other tropical
lands to which the Caucasian goes without
protest. And the basis of comfort is cheap
transport, which, in the case of the Terri-
tory, means a railway. Until the 11-year-
old promise to S. Aus. is honored this vast
region will thus remain what it is at present
—partly a joke and partly a tragic peril.

The Truth About North Sydney.
The campaign by means of which the un-
fortunate Arciiuale Parkhill was dragged
last week, wailing recriminations and pro-
tests, from the pocket-borough of North Syd-
ney, and dumped back at the Nationalist
lI.Q. with a black mark against his name,
constituted an object-lesson in several mat-
ters, all unsavory; but chiefly it demon-
strated the lengths to which the old Liberals
of N. S. Wales have progressed on the road
to Tammanyism since the days when they
held up virtuous hands against the political
immorality of Labor Caucus rule. The
different stages of the cynical ramp, as an
outcome of which W. M. Hughes has been
pushed on to the reluctant Tories of Syd-
ney’s most suburban lot of suburbs, may be
stated this way :
1. Parkhill persuaded the secretaries and chief
women organisers of every Nationalist League branch
and sub-branch in N. Sydney to call on him as a
deputation and urge him, in the name of the people,
to become their representative. He did this prac-
tically the moment the new constituency was out-
lined. The S. M. Herald congratulated North Syd-
ney on its “choice”; the Protestant Federation
intimated that Parkhill would get the anti-Papal
vote; the financial interests behind Nationalism ex-
pressed approval; W M Hughes went out of his
way to wish his Parliamentary supporter in em-
bryo the best of luck. Many a banker would have
given the Nationalist organiser an overdraft on his
prospects at this stage.
2. The first faint note of danger sounded when
Hughesites in Bendigo started to advise the Pri-
minister to keep away from certain centres; when
deteriorated tomatoes, potatoes, etc., began to be
aimed at him even in the reputedly friendly sectors;
and when warm admirers, such as the member for
Wentworth, proved, on the application of the acid test,
to have no intention of letting their devotion drive
them to the extremity of offering him' their safe
seats. The stage had now arrived when no sound
banker would have regarded the reversion of
Park hill's Parliamentary salary as a pawnable
proposition.
3. Hughes announced that he had no idea of
leaving Bendigo; that he could win there by 5000
votes without effort; that rumors to the contrary
were lying propaganda engineered by Earle-Pageites.
4. Parkhill announced that nothing would induce
him to leave North Sydney. Marks announced that
nothing would induce him to leave Wentworth.
Marr announced that nothing would induce him to
leave Parkes. All announced, with almost hysterical
emphasis, that they were sure nothing would
induce Hughes to leave Bendigo.
5. Hughes asked for and got private reports from
the Party organisers in Bendigo, which were so
hopeless that he decided forthwith to abandon the
constituency. Marks was sounded again on the
question of doing the right thing about Wentworth ;
the hard word was put on Marr in respect of
Parkes; both proved obdurate, and the Prime
Minister’s penetrating gaze turned insistently upon
the shivering form and distraught countenance of
Parkhill.
6. Hughes told the S. M. Herald that he
“would as soon think of contesting Brisbane as N.
Sydney,” or words to that effect.
7. One F. H. Molesworth, hitherto unknown
outside Sydney Church circles, announced that he
was a candidate for N. Sydney, and would win
“against Parkhill or anybody else.”
8. Hughes denied that he had any designs what-
ever on N. Sydney, and mentioned again that he
“would win in Bendigo by 5000 votes.”
9. Molesworth announced that he had decided,
in the interests of the Empire, to throw up his cer-
tain prospects of winning N. Sydney and give the
seat to Hughes.
10. Parkhil disowned Molesworth and re-
affirmed his intention of contesting the seat. The
S. M. Herald adopted a peevish tone towards Park-
hill, and simultaneously discovered Molesworth.
11. Molesworth came out with a raking attack
on Parkhill, in which it was suggested that he
was “disloyal,” that the Hand of Rome was behind
him. Only by throwing out Parkhill, it was ex-
plained, and adopting Hughes in his place, could
the machinations of the Vatican be defeated and
Romanism annoyed. It was the king hit. The
former choice of every Nationalist League branch
and sub-branch went out for the full count. He was
still dazed from the impact when his anguished ears
caught the sound of shouts of welcome. They emanated
from those who, a few days previously, had acclaimed
him ; and the uproar was led by the S. M. Herald.
The applause was for Hughes. That man of many
denials had brought off one of the neatest political
confidence-tricks in the history of Federation.
All this plotting and counter-plotting has
not been undertaken, of course, with the
sole object of providing Hughes with a safe
seat for so long as he lives and is ready to
advocate the principles which he damned so
eloquently as a Labor man. The big Sydney
interests who worked the oracle for him,
under his skilled direction, want more for
their money than that. Actually, it repre-
sents a retrogression to the situation of 20
years ago. when, under the leadership of
George Reid, N. S. Wales ranged itself
against the rest of the Commonwealth. The
State Rights cry is to be megaphoned from
Albury to the Q. border; the Canberra
idiocy is to be played against Melbourne,
and Sydney is to be boosted hard at the
expense of the N. S. Wales country dis-
tricts. The ends justify the means in the
opinion of the men who are backing Hughes,
but even they will admit probably that the
means employed were exceptionally disrepu-
table.
v
The Great Swindle.
About the first Sydney phenomenon that is
commented on by visiting Maorilanders is
the hordes of unemployed in the parks and
of destitute ex-soldiers in the streets. These
unfortunates —the fruit of N.S.W.’s central-
ising policy, which is building up one great
unwieldy city and impoverishing 310,000
square miles of territory in the process—are
rarities in M.L. The two islands, with half
the population and one-third the area of
N.S.W., have 11 permanent oversea shipping
ports—Auckland, Gisborne, Napier, Welling-
ton and New Plymouth, in the North. Island ;
and Nelson, Blenheim, Lyttelton, Port Chal-
mers, The Bluff and Westport, in the South
Island. The N.S.W. producer has one—Sydney.
And he has one market —Sydney—to corres-
pond with M.L.’s score of home markets in the
shape of fair-sized cities and ports scattered
throughout the Dominion, with a proportion-
ate lessening of transport cost to the pro-
ducer. According to W. M. Hughes, who
has obviously been out for Sydney support
at any price for some time now, there is
nothing wrong with this state of affairs. To
a New Staters’ deputation at Tam worth he
said on his last visit there: —
From the standpoint of the Commonwealth it does
not matter to us whether they ( the people I are in
Tamworth, or Armidale, or Sydney, or Melbourne,
and whether they go to a few cities or to one does
not matter.
According to this line of argument it is
immaterial from a national standpoint
whether or no Australia’s meagre five
and a half millions are all crowded
into the one spot. And the absurdity
of that claim may be appreciated by
a consideration of what would happen
to any country in which the population
was so distributed, in the event of invasion.
But, apart from such futilities, there remains
the plain fact that if men are to stay on the
land they must have markets within easy
reach, which is onlv another way of saying
that they must have ports within reasonable
distance to enable them to successfully com-
pete with other portions of the world which
have such facilities. Northern New South
Wales is responsible for nearly half the pro-
ducts of the State, and covers an area which
is almost the size of Victoria. Yet it has
no oversea port of its own. Everythin" has
to be hauled hundreds of needless miles over
Sydney-controlled railways, at high rates of
freight, to Sydney. Coif’s Harbor, which the
largest vessels in the Australian trade could
safely enter, has never had its surface dis-
turbed by the propeller of an oversea
steamer, although they pass by daily a few
miles out. If this port was opened up—and
over 40 years ago the then Premier of N. S.
Wales promised that that act of justice
would be done inside three years—practi-
cally the whole of the Northern exports of
beef mutton, wool, butter, cheese, condensed
milk, wheat, sugar, etc., would be shipped
direct to the world’s markets to the benefit
of Australia, as well as to that of indi-
vidual producers. If the Dorrigo-Guyra-
Inverell connection was pushed on with
when the present line from Coff’s Harbor to
Dorrigo is completed, it would mean that by
the construction of 130 miles of railway a
through line would result right from Mun-
gindi on the Queensland border to Coff’s
Harbor on the central North Coast, and the
following mileages would prevail as com-
pared with the present mileage to Sydney :

That is the decentraliser’s case —or rather
part of it—and it is not met either by
idiocies from W. M. Hughes about the bloat-
ing of a few great cities being just the thing
to make a nation prosperous, or by peevish
demands from the S. M. Herald, and Sydney
interests generally, that the people of the
North shall be reasonable and not make so
much noise, and continue on in the old rut
that was good enough for the N. S. Wales of
Fitzroy’s day.
•
The Peopling of the North.
More ethnology from “Cleveland” :
“W.p'.D.” (B. 24/8/’22) accuses me of being super-
ficial when I declare Italians to be “backward.”
and it has been suggested that only alarmists talk
of the possibility of these people dominating the
position in the North. Well, here is what the Pre-
sident of the British Association said, in Sydney,-
during 1914 :
Our grand-children may live to see the charac-
teristics of the American population entirely altered
by the vast invasion of Italian and other south
European elements.
And the Rev. Dr. Andrew Harper was even more
explicit:—
Yet a number of thoughtful Americans have
been wondering whether irreparable damage has not
already been done to the morale, the physique and
the intellect of the country by the invasion which
they have permitted from among the backward
white races of Europe....
In accepting “W.P.D.’s” word that the bulk of the
Queensland Italians come from the north of Italy, I
have to disbelieve Premier Theodore, who says they
come from the south —though I don’t know whether the
word of a vote-hungry politician is more reliable
than that of “W.P.D.,” who probably has an eye on
the prospect of cheap labor. I do agree, however,
that, if he is right, Queensland is getting the best
brand of Italian there is. What I don’t admit is
that we want the best Italians from the north of
Italy any more than we want the pick of the Japan-
ese from the north of Japan, or natives from the
north of anywhere, merely because they happen to be
slightly less objectionable racially than the worst
kind of native from the south.
I remember learning that our forefathers in Great
Britain w'ore skins when Rome blazed with magni-
ficence and boiled Christians in olive oil. But of
what value are such arguments, anyhow? Rome
itself was a wilderness when the Egyptians
flourished and built their pyramids, w'hich puzzle
modern engineers; when the Babylonian astronomers
were calculating the value of the saros to within
191 minutes of what we are able to make it now ;
and when the Chinese were possessed of a litera-
ture, and led the world in painting and art. Will
anyone argue that a modern Gyppo is a desirable
immigrant? And w'hat decent white Australian looks
with enthusiasm on Chow immigration?
I dip my lid to the memory of Garibaldi, one
of whose statues stands near the Art Gallery, Turin.
But that does not imply respect for the liberator’s
countrymen. When I last saw the monument to
him there were hundreds of Italians huddled round
the base of it. They had just arrived from the
Goritz front, where Fritz had casually walked
through their line, and as 1 have not heard the
Italians extolled as long-distance, runners, I could
only conclude that they got as far back as this
from the scene of the trouble ahead of anyone else
because they started sooner. It may have been
imagination, but it looked to me as if Garibaldi
was ashamed of the company he was in. I ulso
had exceptional opportunities for knowing that
the Italian navy came out of the 1914-18 argument
in an exceptionally neat and undented condition, and
that it would have been even less deteriorated
but for the exploits of one man who climbed over
booms into defended harbors, blew up Italian battle-
ships and climbed out again.
“W.P.D.” says “Australian descendants from
British stock have had their chance in North
Queensland, and lost it.” I say that no Australian
Government has either made an honest attempt to
develop the North, or done anything except
crucify those who have spent their lives there and
tried to do the pioneering work in spite of limit-
less boodling and stupendous bungling and official
ineptitude. Southern Governments and syndicates
loaned the money to build railways into mineral
fields, and when the cream of the buried wealth
had been plundered and hurried south, the northern
residents were left with a system of railways that
was largely useless, because it served mineral instead
of agricultural country.
My objection to the Italian in North Queensland
is that he is a poor substitute for a white Aus-
tralian; and that he is industrious and costs nothing
to import has no bearing on this contention. The
landed cost of the first pair of rabbits, spread over the
total number now in Australia, would be infinitesimal ;
also, we could get half-a-million other slightly
colored people into Australia without cost, and their
industry, like that of the rabbit and of the Italian,
would be beyond question,
Timi ditis.
Dear Bulletin, —Years before the Univer-
sity of Sydney admitted the subject of psy-
cho-analysis into its curriculum, X studied it
and applied it to my own personal problems
and those of some of my friends. I have done
my best to keep up with the latest develop-
ments of the science. For these and other
reasons I take leave to differ absolutely from
the writer of “Sexualitis” (B. 31/8/’22).
Brill, he says, “failed to clear up a miscon-
ceptio,il in his own mind concerning the dif-
ference between neurotic and erotic.” Now,
honest investigators (many of whom are not
psycho-analysts) in scores of universities are
agreed that a large proportion of neurotics
who sincerely believe that their nervous sys-
tems are disorganised by this, that, or another
cause, are really sexually disorganised. Set
them right sexually and you set them right
neurally. Again, “Psycho-analysis is really
mental analysis.” Psycho-analysis is not men-
tal analysis; it is the analysis of something
deeper than mind, as that word is generally
understood. Psycho-analysis is really the
analysis of the sub-mental, or the uncon-
scious. “Mind,” as the term is psyco-
analytically understood, means merely the
top layer of a number of psychic levels. “Im-
mense power,” this writer complains, “is thus
placed in the hands of the psychist.” But is
not immense power placed in the hands of
every doctor? And how many doctors abuse
their power? If the power gained by a
psycho-analyst is abused in “innumerable in-
stances,” how comes it that “the cathartic
method” is becoming more firmly established
each year in the clinics, hospitals and univer-
sities of the world? Even here in N.S.W.
doctors are beginning to use the method, the
technique of which is being perfected after
25 years of patient investigation and experi-
ment by Breur and his successors. As I
know from personal experience, in cases of
shell-shocked soldiers, paralytics, paranoics,
sexually precocious children, etc., excellent
results have been obtained where ordinary
methods of therapy have failed. The young
woman’s case, diagnosed as “rheumatism
caused by strangulated emotion,” is sneered
at. What would the writer say to the
case of the married returned soldier,
living here in Sydney to-day, who was
suffering from paralysis of the right
arm and leg, and who is now completely
cured after a few sittings with a psycho-
analyst? The cause of the soldier’s paralysis
was not, as he himself firmly believed, the
result of war-experiences, but of jealousy
concerning his wife. His paralysis was
simply an expression of his belief, buried in
his subconscious: “My wife is untrue to me.
Until my mind is set at rest, never again
shall I hold her to my side.” After the
psycho-analyst (a Sydney doctor) had brought
to* the surface the hidden motivation, the
paralysis disappeared. That is one out of
many instances of functional disturbance which
can be demonstrated, here in Sydney, to have
been caused by complexes, and not by any
organic trouble. “It is ridiculous to suggest
that boys collect stamps, birds’ eggs and so
on as an outlet for sexual emotions.” Is it?
Assertions prove nothing. If the writer will
give me a sitting I shall be glad to prove
to him that his particular hobby (if he has
one) is neither more nor less than his un-
conscious way or sublimating portion of his
sexual energy. If he has no hobby, or other
means of sublimating his “lower” impulses,
then his sexual life is abnormal. As for
"coprophilic wit,” let the writer bring the
cleverest piece of wit he can find, and any
psycho-analyst—or any man about town, for
that matter—will cap it with a specimen of
"vulgar wit” that is cleverer and more amus-
ing. Vulgarity, after all, is a matter of moral
standards, and scientists (I say this ad-
visedly) have no moral standards. The
morality which sets the seal of “vulgarity”
on one thing to-day will be considered
amoral) ty to-morrow. Compare, for in-
stance, the theories about “modesty” in
woman current in 1822 and 1022 re-
spectively ! "And the analyses of dreams!
Rarely has such a farrago of nonsense been
printed.” How, then, account for the fact
that thousands of neurasthenics become
healthy persons after they have had their
dreams analysed'/ One would think, to
read “Sexualitis,” that psycho-analysis was
some new device of charlatans for diddling
the public. The demonstrable truth is that
this branch of psychology is a strong weapon,
which, under proper safeguards (and per-
haps in some instances without proper safe-
guards), is now being used in the fight
against human ills, organic and functional,
real and imagined. “Rubbish.” “Ridicu-
lous.” Always those terms are used when-
ever people suffering from timiditis come
into contact with an idea that startles their
sleepy cerebrums into unusual activity.—

Swallowing a Camel.
“The difficulty of finding a seventh director, accept-
able to all the interests involved, has been solved.
The Prime Minister, Mr. W. M. Hughes, lias been
unanimously elected, and we have received his inti-
mation of acceptance of the position.”—Presiden-
tial announcement at last week’s meeting of
Amalgamated Wireless, Ltd.
The circumstances under which the Prime
Minister’s namesake resigned his director-
ship will bo fresh in the memories of most
people. Thomas Hughes, M.D.C., of
Sydney, is a sensitive man where his per-
sonal honor is concerned, and the moment
it was suggested that he, a shareholder,
should not sit on the Board as the Federal
Government’s nominee he saw the point and
got out. Whether it was intended all along
that lie should do so, in order to make room
for the Prime Minister, no one can definitely
say; such manoeuvres are uncommon in
reputable business circles, hut, on the other
hand, they are taken for granted in political
ones. Certain, it is, however, that the
supersession of Thomas by William is a
disaster to Amalgamated Wireless, assuming
the Board’s new acquisition proposes merely
to fulfil the legitimate functions of a direc-
tor. Thomas Hughes, as a family solici-
tor in an extensive way of business, and as
a director of many big N. S. Wales con-
cerns may be said to have had a lifelong
training in the efficient running of important
companies. W. M. Hughes had never run
anything more involved than a lumpers’
caucus, until he lightly assumed the job of
running the Commonwealth —with what re-
sults, on the financial side, the taxpayers now
realise only too well. So far, there-
fore, as Amalgamated Wireless is con-
cerned, it has exchanged an expert for
an amateur; a professional business-man
for a professional politician. But there is
a principle at stake in the matter which
goes deeper than the success or otherwise
of any politico-private company. The futile
question was asked, in the Representatives,
after the announcement appeared that W.
M. Hughes had joined the Board: “Is he
to be paid any fees?” And in other quarters
there were inquiries sis to whether or no the
Prime Minister —in the event of his proving
less delicate than his predecessor —would be
allowed to acquire shares. The matter that
calls for emphasis is that it is immaterial,
from the public standpoint, whether Hughes
or any other Minister openly profits from
such a billet or not. The danger is that
he is in a position to profit under the rose,
free of any sort of effective check. Here is
an organisation which for _ years to come,
however well it is run, will need periodi-
cally to go hat in hand to the Federal Gov-
ernment for concessions. The man who
grants that assistance may, in his other capa-
city, be the director who asks for it. _ It
may well be that the Ministerial decision
will represent to the company the difference
between profit and loss. An unscrupulous
Minister, aided and abetted by the unscrupu-
lous friends that men of this type naturally
attract to themselves, could grow rich with-
out drawing a shilling in director’s fees or
owing a solitary share. It was on just such
lines that the Ministers of Walpole’s day
enriched themselves; and no one but an
insane optimist would argue that Australia
is in less need of protection against, its
politicians in this century than England was
in the 18th. Mr. Hughes may be abpve
reproach in the matter of business probity,
and he doubtless is. But conventions, like
laws, are established for the weaker vessels;
and to any statesman with an itching palm
this latest idea of blending the Treasury and
Trade, so to speak, is calculated to offer
temptations which are altogether too strong.
Australia’s Suppress.
Dear B., —The Press is mighty, but the Sup-
press is almost—perhaps quite —as influen-
tial. Apparently it pays, too, or there would
hardly be so much o f it. In fact. I think of
one day founding a big daily that will leave
out everything, and so make my fortune.
The Press and Suppress combined are almost
almighty, so far as they reach. Take the
uniform railway question as a case in point.
The attitude of the Sydney Tory Press is
that its own State’s 56-Jin. space between
rails (especiallv the odd weird half-inch),
instead of being an expedient or a happen-
ing, is a gospel. Any deviation from it is
a sign of an ill-balanced mind, just as a road
64|ft. wide might be sane, while one 65ft.
wide was a lunatic. It is “standard, ’
though only a fraction of the Aus-
tralian railways use it, and though it
is not used in at least 15 big rail-
way-owning States, including Japan, South
Africa, Russia, Spain, India and Ire-
land. The Sydney Tory- organs teach that
the States that now possess the 5-Jft. gauge
introduced that alleged monstrosity and burst

should pay the bill for its restoration. As
a matter of fact, the 4ft. 8-lin. gauge (which
only became universal in England in 1892)
was adopted for Australia in 1848, though
no lines existed then; was abandoned by
N.S.W. in 1850; was formally abolished and
the 51ft. gauge made imperative by Act of
the Sydney Legislature in 1852, and was
restored by another Act two or three years

of 1899-1900), but they aren’t published now.
I don’t suppose one could get a letter in the
Sydney Tory Press setting forth these simple
facts, except at advertising rates, and per-
haps not then. The Canberra capital is an-
other example of the same tendency. That its
origin was' unclean, that its situation is
about the least desirable to be imagined, and
that even its legality may be questioned, are
matters on which a great deal could be said,
but none of it ever has been or ever will be
said in the Sydney Tory Suppress. That
institution avers that N. S. Wales is behind
’Berra to the last man: that it would die
for ’Berra to the final dog: and that no oppo-
sition exists save in Melbourne —the place
which, also, allegedly invented the s Jft. railway
gauge. And the Suppress would buy 10 new
waste-paper baskets to hold suppressed com-
munications rather than let doubt be cast
on that story. Newspaper controversy, when
it is permitted, is an unsatisfactory and lop-
sided animal, provided the paper is a strenu-
ous partisan itself and means business. Vic-
tory can generally be assured by publishing
the most telling arguments on one side and
the weakest on the other, and if the debate
is sawn off just when the paper’s side has
fired its bisrgest shot it is understood that
the opposition is dumbfounded and admits
defeat. Wasn’t it the great Dr. Johnson
who used to manufacture Parliamentary
debates, and who boasted that he never per-
mitted the Whig dogs to get the best of the
argument? If it wasn’t he it should have
been. My own influential daily, which will
suppress everything, including the universe,
will appear as soon as the necessary capital
eventuates. Subscriptions are cordially in-
vited. —Yours, etc., Clifford Snook.
Cause and Effect.
Some men have all the luck. After Fleur*
baix, Major-General J. W. McCay returned
to England and dropped into a well-
paid job at Tidworth. In 1918 he
got a K.C.M.G. and came back to Australia.
His friend W. M Hughes immediately
gave him a job, or rather a series of them.
A Commonwealth Gazette which is just
out indicates some of the Major-General’s
more recent pickings :
From October 20, 1921, to June iiO, 1922, lie received
remuneration as chairman oi the Central Disposals
Board of Victoria at the rate of £2OOO a year; and
from October 20, 1921, to June 30, 1922, remunera-
tion at the rate of £IOOO a year, with travelling
allowances of 255. a day, as business adviser to the
War Service Homes Commissioner. These dates
being identical indicate that for a period exceeding
18 months his total remuneration was at the rate
of £3OOO a year, in addition to travelling expenses.
From March 12, 1921, to August 10, 1921, Major-
General McCay, as chairman of the advisory and
consultative committee in the War Service Homes
Commission, was paid at the rate of £ISOO a year
plus travelling expenses of 255. a day. From August
18, 1921, to October 19, 1921, Major-General
McCay's emoluments as business adviser to the War
Service Homes, Commissioner were fixed at the rate
of £lO 10s. a day.
It seems odd that one who is considered
worthy of the generous salary paid to a
War Service Homes Commissioner should
need a “business adviser” at £lO 10s. a day
(plus 255. a day travelling expenses), and
odder still that, despite all these extrava-
gant precautions against administrative
error, the War Service Homes Department
should have drifted into the unholy state
of tangle which notoriously characterises
it at present. And such disclosures have a
way of synchronising with newspaper items
like these
Delegates attending the inter-State conference of
limbless soldiers’ associations, which has been sitting
in Melbourne during the week, waited on the Prime
Minister at Federal Parliament House to-day asking
that improvements should be made in regard to
the payment of pensions to limbless soldiers, their
wives and dependants. Senator Guthrie, who intro-
duced the deputation, said that there were 3779
limbless soldiers in the Commonwealth, 2636 of
whom were leg cases and 1143 arm cases. The pre-
sent scale of pensions (in the case of some of the
men £1 11s. 6d. a week) was not adequate to
live upon. The mental and physical strain on a
limbless man was awful, and he was worn out at 40.
If the requests of the limbless soldiers were granted
an extra £64,000 a year would he needed, but that
would cost Australia only 2jd. a head of population.
The worst feature of the present Act was that if a
man were game enough to work a deduction was
made from his pension.
Even the richest country has only a certain
amount to spend on its war-affected defend-
ers ; and if expensive sinecures are to be
continually invented for one class of ex-
soldier, it is arithmetically obvious that a
less fortunate, class will have to try and live
on £1 11s. 6d. per week, per man, to balance
the account. To this extent a privileged
few of the Major-General McCay type may
be said to be living on the 3779 limbless
ones, and the explanation given, casually,
by the average Government official, that
Hughesism always has been like that, makes
the spectacle no more endurable.

A Chance for a Champion.
Calare (N.S.W.), for which Pigott was
M.H.R. from 1913 to 1919, and which was
unexpectedly lost at the last election to the
Laborite Lavelle, is likely to be represented
in the next Parliament by Neville Howse,
V.C. Dr. Howse served with the N.S.W.
Army Medical Corps in South Africa, with
the A.I.F. in Gallipoli, and was Director-
General of Medical Services in the vanishing
Australian Army One of his colleagues at
the Front was Brigadier-General Ross, who
was Director of Canadian Medical Forces
when Howse held a corresponding position
A FAMILY GROUP.
“In the United States during the first half of 1922 the deaths from the consumption of wood-alcohol
exceeded by over 100 per cent, the figures for any previous six months. The increase in drug-addiction
has been equally remarkable.” — Cable.
in the A.1.P.; and if the candidate for
Calare devotes himself to the interests of
sufferers from war-caused maladies as
vigorously as Dr. Ross has done in the
Canadian House of Commons, he will de-
serve well of the country. Dr. Ross has
been pleading for more sympathetic treat-
ment of soldiers who have contracted tuber-
culosis, nervous affections, kidney disease
and other ailments since their return from
the trenches. He maintains that many of
these cases are misunderstood, not only by
the people among whom they move and seek
the means of earning a living, but by the
Government doctors who examine them with
a view to pensions. In the Canadian Par-
liament recently he discoursed as follows: —
Some soldiers were recruited for special purposes,
such as pioneer work, and on reaching France were
made to perform duties more strenuous, which
often resulted in physical break-downs. Many of
the medical men engaged in examining and dis-
posing of cases like these have only a slight apprecia-
tion of the conditions leading up to the disability.
If you could get medical men familiar with the
effects of the different forms of gas, chlorine,
mustard and so forth (they cannot be treated alike),
you would solve many of the difficulties and allevi-
ate many of the troubles from which soldiers are
suffering to-day. But it seems to be out of the question.
In cases of tuberculosis in ex-service men it is
impossible to get two doctors to state whether the
disease began two months, six months, or a year
ago. But as far as Canada is concerned, it shouldn’t
be a question of determining the duration of the
disease, but of determining whether the man served
under circumstances which were likely to produce that
condition. The war has produced conditions which
you will meet with for years. For years your
surgeons will be operating on victims of high-
explosive shells. Canada must realise that it has
this question on its hands. It will have more tuber-
cular men, more heart-disease cases, more kidney-
disease cases in the next five or ten years, as a
result of the war, than it has had hitherto. Such is niy
deliberate judgment, based on a diagnosis of the
conditions under which these men served, and I was
with them for five years.
That is the statement of an eminent
authority, and of course it applies as
much to Australia as to Canada. The
grim prophecy contained in the clos-
ing remarks may be disputed by other
authorities, but it cannot be ignored by
a nation which is pledged to do the square
thing by the Diggers. There is no getting
away from the fact that many of those who
served in the trenches have not returned
to normal in civil life. Apart from the con-
sumptives, and men whose nerves were shat-
tered or otherwise damaged by high explo-
sives, there are the mounted infantrymen
who got malaria in the Jordan Valley—about
half the strength of one regiment had to go
into hospital the winter after it was dis-
banded —and the thousands of foot-sloggers
on whom the Hun’s beastly gas has left
debilitating, sometimes agonising effects. As
the war recedes the obligations of the Gov-
ernment to these men, And not of the Gov-
ernment only, are in danger of being for-
gotten. They need an advocate to state
their case ant. remind a careless people of
its duty. If Neville Howse is prepared to
become their champion, it will help them
and do further honor to him.
Clericalism in Papua.
Some time ago The Bulletin referred to
the case of the missionaries who are anxious
to bestow a vote on the Papuan savage.
The vote is to be used for the election of
the Papuan Legislative Council, but it is
not intended that Brown Brother shall be
troubled to go to the ppll. The idea is that
his spiritual adviser shall exercise the vast
brown franchise, in addition to that which
the spiritual adviser aforesaid already enjoys
on his own behalf, the method to be employed
following something on the lines of the proxy
vote introduced recently to Queensland by
the ingenious Theodore. In pursuance of
this ideal, a deputation from the London
Missionary Society, the Australian Board
of Missions and the Methodist Missionary
Society waited the other day upon Prime
Minister Hughes. Fortunately, the latter was
so busy making arrangements to save his poli-
tical life in N. Sydney that he had to put the
deputation off to a later date. There is, how-
ever, the serious danger that in his new r6le
of Defender of the Protestant Faith (the
role which is alleged to have got him the
National selection in North Sydney over the
head of Parkiiill), he may issue the man-
date in question without consulting the chief
parties concerned—that is to say, the
Papuan Administration and the white popu-
lation of the Territory. If he does it is
likely the subsequent noise from Papua
will penetrate even his convenient deafness.
The missionary interests have been engineer-
ing this joke for 10 years past. If they get
it through it will hand the government of
Papua over to them, with all the evil results
that government by ecclesiastics has produced
throughout the ages.
Because a Greek prince of Danish descent
was married 33 years ago to a German
woman, Greece has lost all chance of regain-
ing its ancient glory, and Abdul, the
human Phoenix, has risen from the ash-
heap. Had the Greeks thrown in
their lot with the Allies and hurled
their army at Gallipoli when it was thinly
defended, Turkey might have been knocked
out, and the Constantines reinstated at
Constantinople, in 1915. In any case, Greece
would have established an enduring claim
on the gratitude of Britain and France. But
in the contest between family influence and
the foreign policy of the Cretan,
who saw where his country’s interests lay,
family influence won, and the Hellenic king-
dom played an ignoble part in the war,
alienating Britain by the surrender of Fort
Rupel to the Bulgarians, and infuriating
France by a massacre of French marines who
had landed at Piraeus. After the Armistice, on
the strength of having taken part in the
final campaign against the Bulgarians, the
Greek army was allowed to occupy part of
Bulgarian Thrace, including Adrianople and
Xanthe, and the province of Aidin in Asia
Minor, with Smyrna. But on Constan-
tine’s return in 1920 the Allies cut off sup-
plies, and when the Kin°- tried to consol i
date his power by an advance into the old
Greek and Roman province of Bithynia he
was beaten by the Turks under Mustapha
Kemal Pasha. That happened a year ago
in the battle of Sakharia. Winter prevented
the Turks from following up their victory,
but since the campaign was resumed the
Greeks have gone to pieces. With the help
of French tanks and 75’s Mustapha Kemal
Pasha has captured a great part of then-
army, and Smyrna is among the trophies.
As arrogant as ever, the Fez now talks of
chasing the Allied garrisons out of Gallipoli
and Constantinople, and he is certainly in
a position to make things sultry for the
mandatory regimes in Palest'ne and Meso-
potamia, if not for the British in Egypt and
India. And not the least awkward feature
of a situation ominous to British interests
is that the Unspeakable’s triumph is popular
in Italy and France.
“0.K.” : The allegation thatßavaria is now in-
clined to restore its old monarchy, with Prince
Rupprecht as King, must be viewed in the
light of the fact that Bavaria was the first
State in Germany to proclaim a republic.
Early in November, 1918, a Soldiers and
Workers’ Council at Munich waved a repub-
lican flag and announced that rule of royalty
had ceased. Whether the ingrained influ-
ence of much military training has re-
asserted its old supremacy in the Bavarian
national character, or whether swashbuckling
intrigue against the Republic merely ex-
presses aristocratic, autocratic and bureau-
cratic hatred for everything democratic, only
Time ca.n decide. Nobody outside of Ger-
man working-class life can possibly pretend
to know whether Germany at large is con-
verted from Bismarckian faith in military
force, and local scientific belief in the
grandeur of poison-gas warfare, or whether
the “cannon-fodder” population that used to
Hoch the Kaiser is now fed up with violent
death and disablement. Probably the feeding
thus far has been insufficient, because the
glamor of the world-conquest idea is not yet
dissociated from it. BaAmria, Prussia
and most other parts of the Fatherland still
regard new methods of destruction as Ger-
man specialties. Exceptions may be made
in favor of these Rhine provinces which were
somewhat bombed from on high in the latter
stages of the Wai 1 , but no great centres of
Hun population have quaked with fear for the
last hundred years or more. Arrogance,
born of the national military system, was
smacked in the eye in 1918, but not knocked
out. One restoration of shining-armored
monarchy in Germany would have tremendous
significance, and if Bavaria really threatens
to revert to its former blood-and-iron state
of things, Prussia may be assumed to have
some prancing Hohenzollern in view.

Priniinister is reported to haye said that

on to the Vic. Premiership and go to England
next January. One feels that he has taken
the wrong step. He had promised to stand
for Bendigo if the Priininister retired, and
on to a few days ago that promise held.
What was the cause of his sudden change o
mind? Humor has an explanation suggest
ing that somebody other than Harry Lawso
is wearing the Premier’s trousers.

The latest convert to the Country party

Oxford graduate, a barrister and a journalist,
nowadays, besides being a legislator, he is a
fruitgrower and something of a philosophei.
He has never been much of a party man, and
is periodically addicted to the delivery of jere-
miads on all parties Indiscriminately, there
is a suggestion that he has definitely ranged
himself und'er the C.P. banner because he
would like to have another tiy at the benate,
and there is already an idea of an amicable
arrangement by which the Liberals, the
National Laborites and the Country paitj

to speak through the Board of Land and
Works or the Governor-in-Oouncil. It will
be to the Government, of course, that the
unco’ guid will appeal. Bent would have
revelled in such a situation. He would have
hinted at stopping motoring for pleasure on
the holy day and have called attention to
the scandal of boating or swimming; aftei
which he would have viven reluctant consent
to the compromise or expedient he thought
most expedient. ,

The M.L. Parliament is like a Sunday-school com-
pared with the N.S.W. Assembly. There are no
Murphys, Mchirrs or Fitzpatricks across the law-
man Sea. Even the Labor members are intensely
respectable. Maoriland takes its Legislature seri-
ously, and in order to live down all that has been
said about them the Labor members take it seriously,
too. The most violent observation 1 heard from any
of them in an eight-hours' debate was the statement
of McCombs, of Lyttelton, made in a dulcet voice,
that in the matter under review (a trifling one) lie
“had nothing to regret.” I shouldn’t have been
astonished had his colleagues murmured “Amen.

That man who peeped in (B. 31/8/ 22) had dust
on his spectacles. “Bishop” Barnes, so far from
being a “personality,” is the House’s prize bore. .A
gallery man put the clock on him the other day, and
found it took him eight minutes to make a point.
His brother, G.P., commands more notice. It is true
that Vowles takes himself too seriously; hut what
politician doesn’t? Macgregor’.s fault is not so mucli
an overfondness for Latin quotations as a weakness
for crude sarcasm. Still, he is capable of a flashing
phrase. To an outsider his reference to the Govern-
ment as a “two-up” Administration looked innocent
enough in view of the fact that Theodore has a
majority of two. But everyone present knew that
the dour, white-haired lawyer was poking borak at
Theodore, Who is credited (wrongly) with having
been principal or science-master or something in a
two-up school. Ted may have been a pupil at some
kip academy, but a fly with the pennies is part of
most miners’ education. Elphinstone is not the
“most unrural-looking man in the House.” He looks
like a person who would land on his feet anywhere
Fortune tossed him. As a matter of fact, he user
to be an orchardist. To mention other C.P. mem-
bers Breen, who sits next to Elphinstone on the
front Opposition benches, is a chemist, and looks it.
Vowles is a country solicitor, Fletchar a companv
manager, and Appel a property-owner. The greatest
obstacle which this party will have to face at the
next election will be its own mediocrity Bav
Elphinstone there is no one in it who looks like a
leader, and since Elphinstone deserted the National-
ists to link up with the Cocky group his chances ot
inspiring confidence among members of a party that
is just as much city as rural are remote. Kerr,
ex-secretarv of the Returned Soldiers’ League, is
well liked,'but the Hansard staff grows corns on its
brains trying to evolve order out of the chaos oi
blither that pours from his lips. Next to Theodore
McCormack is the ablest man on the Government
side Unfortunately, he is in hospital with a serious
heart affection, and if he ever decides to go back
into Parliament it will most„ likely be as a pm ate
member. Forgan Smith, to whom Hughes once
referred as “Hogan Smith, the Irishman from Glas-
gow,” ranks next among the Ministers. His weak-
ness is his thin skin. A sly Opposition gibe, at
which Theodore or McCormack would gnu, sends
Smith flying off the handle. Among the private
Labor members Jimmy Stopford, the idol of the Mount
Morgan miners, is the outstanding figure. There v
a storv that an old-time feud with Theodore keeps
him out of the Cabinet. His eloquence is of tin
Frank Anstev type, emotional but arresting.

In wild-cats I can fight my weight
W herever men of might debate
With animated jaws.
At Bendigo again, with zest,
I’d put my fortune to the test,
But, oh 1 I have to pause
And estimate, if I were bumped,
What it would cost the Cause.
Although I do not care a speck
What dangers are about,
1 can’t forget, when Harold reeled,
Pierced by a shaft on Hastings field,
His army fled in rout,
i'll take no chances like to these,
And that is why I hit the breeze,
Ignoring gibe and flout,
For, comrades mine, right well you reck,
The Cause would get it in the neck,
If I were counted out.

When Barnet Glass distributed 10 p.e. divs.
two years ago the directors announced that
“what may be regarded as a reasonable
provision to meet a probable decline” in
stock values bad been made. But rubber and
cotton markets crashed so badly that for 1921,
after writing down stocks so that operations
would be on a “safer trading basis,” the
directors had to dip into reserves for £B5OO
to pay 4 p.e. The latest accounts dis-
close that all the writing-down was
quite inadequate, and that when the value
of stocks held at June 30 had been reduced
to replacement cost a loss exceeding the pro-
fits of any two years had been made. It has
been a very severe reverse for the co., which
developed in a remarkable way when the
war gave the local rubber-manufacturing
industry big opportunities. The set-back
was not altogether unexpected; no other
industry has had such a severe mauling as
the rubber industry, both growing and manu-
facturing ; for nearly two years markets
have been glutted with rubber, and present
prices are belovv production costs on most
plantations. Meantime, the manufacturing
industry has had to contend with falling
values in other commodities, particularly
cotton. Manufacturers who made contracts
in high markets, so as to ensure regular
sunnlies. were badly caught. No doubt
Barnet Glass suffered in this way; but, as
The Bulletin remarked 12 months ago,
“stock of a book value almost as large as
paid capital js a big load to carry in these
uncertain days.” At June 30, 1921, paid
capital was £491,598, and no less than
£379,725 was owed to the banks and others.
The heavy loss resulted from unloading
stocks so as to lighten this indebtedness.
During the year stocks were reduced from
£490.843 to £240.355 and liabilities from
£379.725 to £240.388. These and other
movements are shown in this comparison:—

The Profit and Loss account is now on the
wrong side of the balance-sheet for £89,485,
and the directors are consulting shareholders
as to the best means of effacing the deficit
and putting the balance-sheet into sound
condition again. The directors no doubt
now regret their haste in issuing scrip for
reserves and goodwill when the business was
booming. Cos. which bad experienced other
booms were more cautious, and the reserves
they accumulated during the abnormal indus-
trial and trade activity of the war years
have enabled them to maintain a sound con-
dition since the bubble burst. Had Barnet
Glass proceeded steadily and accumulated
substantial reserves, instead of capitalising
profits and distributing fat divs., the direc-
tors could have covered post-boom losses.
Seven years ago two fully-paid ordinaries
were issued for every one, goodwill for
£22.500 having been introduced into the
balance-sheet to provide the bonus shares.
Four years ago £73,750 of accumulated pro-
fit was capitalised. Of t?tal liabilities of
£246.388 at June 30. £187.548 was overdraft
at the Commonwealth Bank. Liabilities
slightly exceeded the book value of stocks,
but if those values hold and book debts are
healthy, creditors are well protected: there
were assets apart from properties, machinery,
etc., equal to almost 30s. for every £1 of
liabilities. The directors report that “there
has been a decided improvement in the vol-
ume of trade,” and that since the balance
“turnover has been well maintained and
satisfactory profits shown.”

The Standard is not much concerned with
underwriting outside Australasia, conse-
quently its loss rate for the past 12 months
was not affected to any extent by the
abnormal claims which have been experienced
through London. Conditions have been so
bad in “that difficult underwriting territory”
that even the big New Zealand Insurance Co.
some months ago “decided upon a policy of
gradual but drastic curtailment.” Losses
tiaroughout the world have been unusually
heavy, and the Standard’s claims rate last
year was higher than at any time since 1916.
Still it was several points less than the pre-
war average, though whatever advantage was
gained in that way was more than counter-
balanced by heavier expenses. On the other
hand, a much larger business has compen-
sated. Ten years ago an underwriting sur-
plus of 12.6 p.e. gave £11,175; last year 9.3
p.e. yielded £17,975. This compares the
Standard’s underwriting figures for many
years, and shows how rapidly its business has
expanded:—

The directors did not hasten to capi-
talise profits: they paid good divs. on
original capital, but they always made sub-
stantial additions to reserves. Prior to the
first and only transfer in 1919 (£25,000) paid
capital was £75,000 and reserves totalled
£214,951. Capital is now £lOO,OOO and re-
serves £265,289, and net interest from those
funds alone exceeded by £298 the £15,000
required ‘for the 15 p.e. div. The whole
of any underwriting profit goes to strengthen
reserves. Including £4926 net added to an
investment depreciation reserve, but deduct-
ing £2OOO voted , to a guarantee and provi-
dent fund, the Standard last year laid aside
£21,199 for future reference. So despite
the fall of values and general depression, the
co. had a very good year. Its affairs are so
comfortable that, had no underwriting
profit been made, it could have paid 15 p.e.
divs. from its investment earnings and still
maintained its strength.. The total funds of
£365,000-odd exceeded double the year’s net
premium income. Funds 1$ times premiums
are generally considered adequate protection
for policy-holders. Reserves equal to 40 p.e.
of premiums are regarded as reasonable pro-
vision for unexpired risks; after payment
of the final div. this co.’s reserves were 68
p.e. of last year’s net premiums.
The investment of funds is nowadays en-
tirely satisfactory. In pre-war years the
directors had a weakness for mortgages;
practically one-half of the balance-sheet total
was in that line. The security may have
been unquestionable, but thev are not the
best of assets for a co. which may at a,ny
time be obliged to turn its investments into
cash. The financing of the war entirely
changed the appearance of balance-sheets;
since 1914 £lBO,OOO more assets have accumu-
lated, and meantime the amount loaned on
mortgage has been reduced £74,000. Here are
further comparisons:—

The balance-sheet total at June 30 last was
£419,552, and almost 87 p.e. (£364,002) was
made up of Government and municipal securi-
ties, cash and book debts.

Foggitt Jones, Ltd. —Followers of the
Edward Dyason Proprietary and 11. Byron
Moore and Day, the two underwriting con-
cerns which guaranteed the £lOO.OOO of 8 p.e.
prefs. offered by this co. in .Tune last year,
picked a winner in Foggitt Jones, Ltd. The
shares carry a cumulative 8 p.c„ with
rights to 10 p.e.; and for the first year the
pref. holders get the maximum div. The
float was a very inviting one, though at the
time several other concerns in the canned-
goods business were in Queer-street. The
old proprietors passed over all assets at
severely written-down values; those book
values were approximately only two-thirds of
the figures disclosed by independent valua-
tions. That, of course, gave the prefs.
better backing than was revealed by the
prospectus balance-sheet, and, as The Bul-
letin remarked at the time, ‘‘brightened the
prospects of the public getting more than
the minimum 8 p.e.” After allowing £8482
for depreciation, the co. shows a profit of
£88,600 for the 18 months to June 30 last,
the new eo. having taken over as from
December 31, 1920. The ordinaries appa-
rently received no divs. for the first six
months, but got 8 p.c. for the second term
and 5 p.c. more for the past half-year, mak-
ing 13 p.c. for the 12 months to June 30.
So, for the 12 months they have been inter-
ested, the prefs. received their maximum
10 p.c. After paying these divs. and £16,118
taxes, a balance of £41,508 remained. Of
that £lO,OOO has been put aside as provision
for taxation, £21,538 appropriated for a
goodwill reserve, and £5OOO written off flota-
tion and preliminary exes., which ran into
£9647. In the float the old proprietors
took £30,000 cash for goodwill, an amount
less than one year’s profits in the old con-
cern.
Assuming that the £lO,OOO reserved for
taxation is not required for assessments on
operations to June 30, after payment of the
final divs. the co. had reserves which were
approximately £l4OO in excess of the £39,647
which had been paid for goodwill and ab-
sorbed by formation costs. For a co. which
has been established only 18 months that is
a singular achievement. At the balancing-
date paid capital was £281,013. The book
value of properties and plant was £109,144,
and more or less liquid assets totalled
£232,838. Liabilities amounted to £45,644,
leaving a surplus of liquid assets of
£187,194. The Foggitt-Jones business was
established in a small way in 1904.
There are now ham and bacon and
canning factories at Bendigo (Vic.),
West Maitland (N.S.W.), Oxley (Q.) and
Bellevue (W.A.), and the £19,942 of shares
in other cos. shown in the balance-sheet sug-
gests that the new co. exercised its option
and acquired a controlling interest in the
Maoriland branch of the old concern.

The profits above do not tally with those
shown by the directors: instead of the
£88,303 and £01,035 for the past two
years, the published P. and L. accounts
claimed only £35,024 and £35,834 respec-
tively—^-very little more than was required
for divs. Prior to the disclosure of profits
eheh year the management transfers varying
amounts to an insurance fund and to a re-
serve for “depreciation, special renewals and
replacements, bad and doubtful debts and
Contingencies.” In the table the net addi-
tions to these reserves are included with
profits, which are, therefore, not the true
net profits. Some very large amounts have
been dropped into these reserves, and even
in 1921, when all was not smooth sailing, the
net contribution to the big composite reserve
represented one-eighth of the book value of
the steamers. During the 12 months to
June 30 last £4551 net was added to the
insurance fund and £20,650 to the other
reserve. It is impossible to ascertain the
true net profits except with inside know-
ledge of the denreciation and insurance lay-
by actually required. There is now £51,240
set aside for insurances and £259,837 _ for
other purposes—in addition there is £5OOO
in a general reserve and £6BOO in a reserve
of old share premiums—-but as the total
provisions necessary for insurance, deprecia-
tion and so on are not ascertainable, the
whole of the £337,348 of reserves cannot be
definitely regarded as additional backing to
the paid capital of £366,000.
Last year was the poorest for the co. since
1917: less cargo was carried, and fewer pas-
sengers. However, the Melbourne S.S. Co.
was fortunate in one respect during the dull
period: it had a much smaller fleet to main-
tain. When abnormal values were ruling
the co. sold the Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne
and Kapunda, and a considerable portion of
the very handsome profits and large reserves
shown in the introductory table represents
surpluses over and above the written-down
book values of those steamers. During the
past year the eo. has been replacing some of
the vessels sold. The Coolana (2197 tons)
was added to the fleet, a new 7000-ton cargo
steamer was purchased and will be in com-
mission shortly, and a new tug is on the
way from England. These purchases have
been made in a depressed market, so
the co. appears to have made good use of the
cash it received for the old steamer’s. At
June 30, 1921, the fleet, engineering works,
plant, properties and the Williamstown float-
ing dock had a book-value of £315,232; at
the latest balance, £440,514. The liquid
position was cut into for nearly £lOO,OOO to
pay for the additions. This shows how the
liquid surplus piled up after the Woolgar
was added 74 years ago, arid the movements
during the past two years:—
Dec.,’l4. June,’2o. June,’2l. June,’22.
Liquid assets . . £68,819 £500,073 £509,022 £432,213
Liabilities . . 63,830 166,298 128,600 151,599

Other assets £393,450 £309,076 £316,232 £440,514
The co. is still in a good position
to purchase additional steamers as op-
portunity offers: after payment of the final
divs. surplus liquid assets exceeded all lia-
bilities by £202,834. Ln public securities,
deposits and cash the co. had £138,050 in ex-
cess of all accounts owing. A feature of the
Melbourne S.S. Co. is that during the boom
years there was no writing-up of assets.
It is not possible to decide the precise ussets-
backing to shares, but assuming the fleet to
be worth all it is shown at in the accounts,
and deducting from cash assets the £20,000
of 0 p.c. pref. capital, each £1 ordinary share
was represented by fixed assets with a book-
value of 255. lid., and net liquid assets (after
final divs. had been paid) for 13s. lid. more
—altogether 395. lOd. The support for capi-
tal is, therefore, excellent. So also are the
prospects of maintaining a good div. rate for
shareholders; the co.’s funds have to earn
only slightly more than 5 p.c. net to give
shareholders 10 p.c. *

Auto. ’Phones did better last year than in
any other period in its 10 years’ life, but
a big slice of the £8464 was not derived from
contracts with the P.M.G.’s Department.
The co. is agent for the Auto. Electric Co.
of Chicago, and a good profit was made
during the year by anticipating dollar-
exehange fluctuations and purchasing TJ.$.
securities in readiness for settlements with
the Chicago co. At June 30 the co. had
£31,315 invested in dollar securities, the in-
vestments being shown in the books at par
value ($4.86), though the market for some
months has been steady at around $4.45.
Should the £ unexpectedly recover to par the
co. stands to lose 10 p.c. on its dollar in-
vestments ; on the other hand, when Britain
begins to pay interest on the thousand mil-
lions it owes exchange may sag. At
best, only a slight improvement can be pos-
sible ; the co. considers a decline more likely.
Anyway, in preparing for commitments on
purchases Auto. ’Phones is not risking much
in the gamble.
Though the co. has done very well in
recent years, it would have been more active
had funds been available for construction of
new exchanges. However, the Government is
now getting a move on: latest estimates pi'o-
vide for considerable new works to improve
the present antiquated systems. Auto. ’Phones
confidently anticipates some good orders, and
is getting its affairs into condition to finance
the purchase of material: the £37,500 of
unissued capital is being offered shareholders
at par. This will take paid capital to
£lOO,OOO.
In the introductory table a deficit of
£8047 is shown. That is the amount of
capital not represented by tangible assets.
In the float 10 years ago £5OOO was paid for
goodwill, and in a reconstruction several
years later £7500 was added to this account.
Nowadays goodwill is parcelled up in the
balance-sheet with property, stock and plant,
work in progress and book debts, altogether
£78,244, and apparently nothing has so far
been written off the £12,500 of goodwill.
Partly to finance its dollar investments, at
June 30 the eo. owed £41,113. Other asset®
were deposits on contracts, £2641 and £2116
cash.

Outside interest in the possibilities of
Roma and adjacent districts has revived.
The tracks of Mayo and Grey, Anglo-Persian
specialists, had scarcely been obliterated be-
fore Dr. Milsom, a geologist from the land
of the Almighty Dollar, was on the spot. Dr.
Milsom conferred in Brisbane with the Min-
ister for Mines as to the rules and regula-
tions governing boring in the U.S.A. They
are, ot course, much more liberal and busi-
ness-like, and give private capital some en-
couragement to pursue the risky business.
Thus the Doctor may have ulterior motives
in examining Western Queensland, where
there is considerable evidence of strata at one
time, or even now, being petroliferous. Nearly
everyone who has gone into the question is
convinced that Western Queensland has a
great chance of being the oilfield of Aus-
tralia, though they do not. all pin their faith
to the Roma position. Some of the best
qualified are decidedly pessimistic about
Roma giving commercial quantities of oil
—mainly on account of the rapid tem-
perature gradient—and would like to see
boring done a little further up the dip.

Beaudesert (Q.) has not decided yet
whether it will put up the cash to sink
a trial bore at Dunn’s. There is plenty of
enthusiasm, but this vanishes as soon as
cash is asked for. Most people regard the
oil in Dunn’s bore as dinkum and a natural
seep, despite the official verdict, which did
leave an impression of slight doubt. In
this case it would be far wiser to sink a
small shaft alongside, the bore to get more
of this oil, and prove or disprove that point.
The shaft would cost only £2OO, but it is
too cheap and simple; Beaudesert prefers
a deep bore. Three applications for
oil-prospecting licenses in various parts of
the district have been lodged.
* * * #
“Talpa”: J. L. Strevens recently put
up a fairly good case for large exploration
areas, as he is in duty bound to do, but the
fact remains that the oil-leases granted in
Westralia are unwieldy and would require
the expenditure of an enormous amount of
capital qyen to get a rough geological survey
made of the area, without which no drilling
should be conducted. As things are now it
is evident that the Government is going to
be robbed of a considerable revenue by the
action of licensees in subletting their hold-
ings to bona-fide prospectors vvho are other-
wise unable to get a look in. As to Mr.
Strevens’s remarks about Colombia, the
concessionaire there and in Venezuela, Peru,
Brazil and Mexico cannot transfer any inter-
est or right in his concession unless the con-
sent of the respective Governments has been
first obtained. This applies, also, to Gov-
ernment lands in TJ.S.A. and Canada, and
may, for all the writer knows, apply to
Westralia as well ; but if so the Government
has been very acquiescent. Nobody wants
to hinder genuine prospecting, but it is
pretty hot when the prospector has 'to pay
a licensee £lOOO for an option over 1000
square miles, when the licensee is paying
only £lO per annum for 85,000 sq. miles, as
in the case of Freney’s (B. 22/6/’22).
J. L. Strevens, in reply to The Bul-
letin’s London correspondent (B. 7/0/’22) :
At least one group of British oil magnates is ready
and anxious to find all the preliminary money for
Kimberley oil-development the moment authentic
samples of seepage or shallow bore-oil are forth-
coming from that locality. The terms on which
thej’ declare they are prepared to join the venture are
distinctly favorable to present holders.
The Royal Dutch and Anglo-Persian people are
watching every development, but they will only come
in on further boring results warranting the expendi-
ture of large capital to bring the potential oil-fields
to the producing stage. In such a base, although
the big groups only allot from 15 to 2)0 p.c. of the
issue to the vendors, and, except in the case of a pub-
lic flotation, subscribe the working capital themselves
without outside assistance, the interest accruing to
the vendors is more valuable than if purely local
cos. were formed and allotted them a large parcel of
shares.
Ultimately, there is no doub.t that the big groups
will control any worth-while oil-fields that are
developed here, but it will still pay the pioneers to
go ahead and reach that stage where co-operation
with one of the groups can be made possible.
Rivertree (N.S.W.), near the Queens-
land border, not far from Stanthorpe, was
once acclaimed as a probable rival of Broken
Hill. There are extensive silver-bearing lodes,
which also carry an appreciable amount of
gold. The ore where proved is of fairly
good grade, but as the lodes are in extremely
rough country transit to smelters is im-
practicable, except at prohibitive cost. A
water-jacket furnace was erected in 1890,
but it was an absolute failure, as iron flux
was not available for the treatment of the
highly siliceous ore. Then, at considerable
expense, a plant for leaching by the Russell
process was tried. White-Howell furnaces
being used for chloridising and roasting. This
was successful only on specially selected ore.
Expenditure on these failures must have run
pretty close to six figures. The field has
remained idle for many years—a bitter
memory of shattered hopes. The principal
mines were recently acquired by a Sydney
syndicate, which is confident that the solu-
tion of the treatment problem rests in the
application of the cyanide process to the
oxidised ore and magnetic separation of
minerals from the sulphide ore. Cyaniding
has its limitations, and the syndicate will act
wisely if it makes exhaustive tests to deter-
mine whether or not the process can be
applied profitably. As described in official
reports the ore is complex and contains
some base metals which are either “glutton-
ous ehewers” of KCy., or powerful de-
oxidisers. That good ore is there in abun-
dance is beyond question, and if the syndi-
cate has the good luck, or judgment, to select
the right method for the recovery of the
metals at moderate cost Rivertree will be-
come a mining field of some importance.
• « • •
Mitchell’s Creek, Wellington (N.S.W.),
was the first at which the cyanide process
was tried in the State, a plant being in-
stalled there by the Macarthur-Forrest co.
The initial attempt at treatment of the tail-
ings was a failure, owing to the presence of
copper and salts, the neutralisation of which
was not quite understood. Since then vari-
ous syndicates have had a go at the big heap
of tailings with more or less success, There
remain considerable quantities of old slimes
and the tailings accumulated from the crush-
ings of the Bodangora co., and these have
recently been secured under lease by a Mel-
bourne syndicate which has command of the
services of cyaniders who have been very
successful at the business. For many years
the mine was one of the standard producers
of the State, but on the dissolution of the
three D.’s partnership—“Belata” Dick, Phil
Davies and “Tommy” Dalveen—its down-
ward career started. The original plant was
of the most rickety-dick type. The Belata
man scrapped it all, and at a cost of nearly
£40,000 erected an up-to-date equipment,
which never earned a penny of profit. In
the No. 1 mine the lode was worked for
over 3000 ft. in almost continuous section to
a depth of 700 ft., and year in and year out
crushings averaged about 14dwt. per ton, con-
centrates and tailings showing equal to at
least Gdwt. more. There is a massive lode at
the bottom worth about 7dwt. —quite unpay-
able under present conditions. The marked
peculiarity of this lode was that it gradu-
ally increased in size as sunk upon, but did
a corresponding proportion of gold :
in 7ft. of stone there was no more gold than
was contained in 3ft.
“Old Lucknow Miner” has another look:
Leases have now been pegged out all round the
old village, and the various cos. and syndicates
have about reached the limit in names—(Lucknow
Mines, South Lucknow, East Lucknow, AVest Luck-
now and North Lucknow, together with to
each, with a few other points of the compass thrown
in, such as Lucknow 66, and a litter of Lucknow
Pups which may yet bark.
Harry Newman’s spirit must be squirming in its
present Deep Levels in an effort to get back into the.
game again; but it is doubtful whether even that
lucky miner could secure favorable results from many
of the properties now held. One or two of the
shows certainly look most promising, but the remain-
der appear to have little chance. A map sohwing
the relative position of the various shows would now
be a great help to the investor, but that is not
possible until surveys have been made of all the
leases.
Properties which at present appear to justify their
holdings would include the following:—
Lucknoiv Mines. —-This covers portion of the old
field, and it would appear that the old miner did miss
a few patches, for this co. has opened up new ground
with good gold values in places. How r long these
values will last, however, is another matter.
Lucknow Pups is working, on the eastern end of
the old field, an area of virgin country extending to
the South Lucknow ground. The Pups appears to
have a chance, but must expect a lot of dead work
to locate payable makes of ore.
South Lucknow. —The ground held by this co. is
absolutely virgin country as far as the famous
Lucknow joint is concerned. The co. sank a shaft
through the overlying basalt into the older gold-
bearing rocks, and, after a lot of dead prospecting
work, has succeeded in locating two permanent gold-
bearing reefs striking towards the contact between
diorite and serpentine. To an old-time Lucknow
miner, a brief examination of these, with their con-
tained minerals, caleite and arsenical pyrites, would
indeed recall the boom days. Although still in
diorite, good gold values are already present in
reefs measuring up to 4ft. in width. If history
is to repeat itself these should become richer and
richer as the serpentine is approached; so South’s
chances of developing large bodies of highly payable
ore are very promising.
South Lucknow Extended. —Adjoining South Luck-
now, this co. has sunk a shaft through the basalt
into diorite, and indications point to the contact
being adjacent to the shaft. Judging by work in the
South Lucknow, the Extended should have an excel- •
lent chance of striking the east and west veins mak-
ing into the joint very shortly. Whether high
values will show up depends on whether Lucknow
conditions prevail at this end of the field.
Lucknow 66 adjoins the Extended, but sufficient
work ha-s not yet been done to justify an opinion,
although the presence of asbestos in the basalt points
to the contact beinlg close.
Operations at the Sand Queen and Glad-
some mines, Comet Vale (W.A.), have ended
disastrously. The mines were worked with
much success by the original owners, but
two years ago water became too heavy. Syd-
ney took an option over the shows and set
about unwatering the workings, but during
baling operations a rope snapped and
a tank became jambed in the shaft-
timbers, and operations were aban-
doned. The formal option-holder, F. B. Trude,
is now answering a complaint by the owners
in the Warden’s Court, at Kalgoorlie, to the
effect that he allowed sand to run into the
shaft, used dynamite in shaft, thereby dam-
aging timber, and. further, left a paling tank
jambed at No. 4 level. The case is off inter-
est to lease option-holders in general, as it
is likely to enlighten them as to their respon-
sibilities.
In the south drive at the 1600 ft. level of
the South Kalgurli payable ore continues to
be exposed. This and the recent good values
met with at the Ivanhoe 3000 ft. level are
the most important developments reported
from the Golden Mile for some time. Until
a few months ago it was considered that
nearly all Ivalgoorlie’s big mines were booked
for the tributor within three years, but re-
cent events indicate that at least Ivanhoe,
Golden Horseshoe and South Kalgurli will
survive in present conditions for a longer
period.
North Fingall, having commenced un-
watering Bewick, Moreing’s old 800 ft. ver-
tical shaft, and the water inflow being light,
a commencement with the extension of the
crosscut at the bottom towards the expected
continuation of Great Fingall lode should be
made this month. That lode was deep-seated,
and as the supposed continuation of it can
be traced on the surface through North Fin-
gall ground, that co.’s chances of striking
it are considered good.
* * * •
New Langi Logan, Ararat (Vic.), has had
hard luck. Just when, according to all the
canons of alluvial mining, gold should have
been lying in plenty on the bottom of
the gutter below the Catlicart junction,
an island was found to have occupied
the middle of the old river. It lies a bit
below where the Cathcart tributary tumbled
into the main stream, and with the torrent
swirling round it the river bed was washed
clean of gold. Yields were good for a while,
and it looked as if, after all, New Langi
might make amends for an inglorious past.
Now, after having sopped up £lBO,OOO in 15
years, without giving backers a chance, it
is on the call-list again, and is appealing to
Mines Minister Sam Barnes for State aid.
* ifr * *
Third Chance, Kilmore (Vic.), had the
sense to defer buying plant before proving
whether it has a decent shoot of ore. But
it was over the odds when, “actuated by a
desire to lighten as much as possible the
burden of calls,” it appealed to the Mines
Department for aid. Minister Barnes sent
geologist Baragwanath to run the rule over
the show, and he produces assays giving
Bfoz. gold and 26 p.c. stibnite at No. 3 level.
The Board says that no difficulty exists in
selling gold-antimony products, adds that
there are 7000 tons of pay-ore in sight, and
that the mine will repay the expenditure
upon it. If prospects are so good, why not
find the necessary cash?
New Blue Consolidated, Bendigo, won
3540 z. from 690 tons last week. A Is. div.
was declared, making Bs. per share during
the current year. This div. is number 152,
and brings the total paid by the co. to
£208,125. Mine prospects are reported to be
excellent. The good gold shoot has been
struck 16ft. over the 1600 ft. rise, or a
shorter distance by lift, than was expected.
The height of payable ore disclosed at this
point is 70ft., less 10ft. of intermediate level.
In the latter level, at the south end, there is
an important improvement. The level there
is on the top of the formation which is being
followed, but another “roll” has come in and
this is showing pavable gold. This “top
roll” may give an additional height of backs.
* * * *
Bendigo doesn’t seem to. be content with
having “Blue” associated with successful
gold-mines. It has just formed a co. under
the inappropriate name of New Red, White
and Blue Collieries, the object of which is
to search for coal near Oxley, on the Vic-
torian side of the Murray, on the supposed
extension of the coal seam on the N.S.W.
side, at Oaklands (Coorabin). A thick
deposit of friable ~coal has been discovered
there, and several spasmodic efforts have
been made to work it; but so far there
has been no demonstrative proof that it is
of any special value as a commercial pro-
position.
* * * *
The Premier reef at South Kyneton(Vic-)
has yielded £2048 worth of gold since it was
discovered in Jan. last —30 tons of stone
giving 4840 z. It was a very narrow vein
near the surface, but in 180 ft. of sinking has
increased to 2|ft.; but whether that width
is nearly 20oz. stuff is not stated, although
it is reported to be "very rich.”
* * *
Amongst the number of small mines at
.Silver Valley, near Herberton (Q.), the
,01 d -Nolan is showing out and promises to
develop into something a bit above the ordi-
nary. Recently it has been turning out ore
worth ±ll to £l2 a ton, a crushing a few
weeks back of 81 tons giving tons of tin
concentrates. Ihe vein has been very per-
sistent in values, and has been making wider
the further it is followed in, the last cut
showing ISin. worth 14 p.c. A winze from
the .lOrt. level is going down in rich ore to
intersect the tunnel, and this will mean a
block sufficient to carry the mine over manv
a rainy day. The bottom of the winze is
carrying over 18iii. of rich ore, so it looks
like lasting until it meets the tunnel, which
is about 80ft. below.
* * * *
The railway from the port of Bowen to
its coalfield has just been opened for traffic,
and an immense tonnage is now within easy
reach of ship-bunkers. Progress will pro-
bably not be very rapid, for there are better
export coals on the eastern seaboard, but
Bowen will undoubtedly make its weight felt
in the future. Estimates of probable ton-
nage running into hundreds of millions of
tons have been published, but until a geo-
logical survey of the field is completed they
must be considered as only rough guesses.
The two chief seams are the Bowen and
Garrick, averaging 15ft, and 7ft. thick re-
spectively, and these were discovered re-
cently some miles away from where they
have already been opened up, indicating a
larger area of workable coal than was pre-
viously known. Coal from the Bowen and
Garrick seams can be expected to run from
10 to 12 p.c. ash, and it makes a fairly
good metallurgical coke and a good steam
fueL Its immediate future is dependent
almost entirely on developing an export busi-
ness.

Old Jabez Wright, M.L.A., upon whom
Death laid a sudden hand the other day, was
a man of no brilliancy, much sincerity and
many refreshing little idiosyncrasies. In the
days when he attended Labor Conferences
his first business was always to remove his
coat; and although he got over the idea of
shirt-sleeves in Parliament, he always dis-
dained to wear either collar or tie. Every
session he brought forward a motion for Par-
liament to observe ordinary working hours;
regarding the thing as “a job,” he refused to
surround it with any frills. He was 71 at
the end. Full of odd, direct sayings, one of
Jabez’s favorite methods of opening a speech
was: “Mr. Speaker, I am a man of few
words —and many drinks.”

“Kelby”: In a shop at which Henry
Lawson was a fairly regular customer one
of the sales girls was an amateur—a very
amateur —poetess, and a few months back
she nervously asked him to read one of her
poems. It was a
poor thing, nearly
as poor as the girl
herself, but Law-
son thanked her
for the privilege of
being allowed to
read it. and said
he could easily sell
it for her. Later
he handed her an
absurd price for it,
but explained that
it would probably
be “held over” for
a while, as the
market was very
full just then.

The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney will
next month lose its oldest servant, manager
W. R. Sayers, who retires after 55 years’
service. In June, 1838, his father, Edward
M. Sayers, was associated with J. P. Fawk-
ner in founding the Independent Church in
Melbourne. The Sunday services were held
in the long room of Fawkner’s Hotel, which
stood on the site of the Union Club Hotel,
Market and Collins streets. Sayers, the elder,
was on the building committee, which erected
the temporary chapel on the n.-e. corner of
Collins and Russell streets. He was then
in the shipping business, and on returning
to Sydney he became manager of the Port
Phillip Packet Co., represented St Leonards
in the third Parliament (1559-60), and lived
at Lavender Bay, where the future bank
manager was born.
“Digger’s Batman”: Sydney News men-
tioned on Sunday that Major David Thom-
son, M.C., now toiling at Sydney Repat.,
was the original No. 1 of the Ist Battalion
—the first man officially enlisted for the
A.I.F. I knew him first as a W.O. in the
C.M.F., when he was already a veteran, hav-
ing, when only 16, fought with the Gordon
Highlanders in the Boer War, and, later, in
India. When I was in England, late in the big
war, I traced the records of the early num-
bers, and was surprised to find that Nos. 1
to 30 of the Ist Batt. were mainly alive and
well. The reason proved to be that those
figures had been collared, after the evacua-
tion, for the H.Q. staff. Thomson, by that
time, had received his commission, and didn’t
want a number: and the sadly large propor-
tion of his real numerical mates didn’t need
numbers either —they had stayed on Gallipoli.
Some of the men who had early numbers
and safe billets handed them were compara-
tively late a rrivals.

the “royalties” with half the popu-
lation, but before the end of the
festival he hadexhausted the
treasury’s generosity and had only
his train-ticket back to Sydney.
I had been seeing him every day,
but never guessed the state of
his pocket until he came to say
farewell. The look of elfin gaiety
had departed from his eye and a
heavy misery had settled on his
features. He forgot to salute me
and shake me by the hand. I
asked him casually what the
trouble was. He didn’t speak,
but, sitting down at my desk, he
wrote in a large script: “I would
be obliged if you would caff at
the pawnshop at and get my
other suit of clothes out of pawn.
I promised that I would bring
back the suit intact.” To whom
he had made the promise 1 do not
know, but there was the suspicion
of deep feeling in his tones when
the garments were restored to him.
Lieut.-Col. G. J. Bell, who
is Darwin’s mouthpiece in '
the House of Reps., saw
active service in the S’Afri-
can War, gaining a cap-
taincy and a D. 5.0., and,
incidentally, a severe wound
at Bakkop in 1902. When
the Big War started he left
as 2nd Lieut with the 3rd
Light Horse, and later
bossed that regiment in
many a fight in Palestine.
He came back with C.M.G. trailing after his
name.
“Mac I.” : The recent death of Jack Sum-
mers, the last representative of the family
in Torres Strait reminds me. Just after
an American missionary lecturing in the
south had made a sweeping charge of drun-
kenness against Torres Strait pilots, and
thereby provided some excited discussion at
T. 1., another missionary, Jack and I occu-
pied three adjoining rooms at the Grand
Hotel. Early one morning Jack called softly,
‘Mac, come and look at this,” and pointed
to a dental set lying on the mat outside the
sky-pilot’s door. “I suppose,” he added re-
flectively, “the gentleman’s boots are in the
water-jug.” Jack never reached the domi-
nant position long held at the island by his
father, the late Frank Summers, but in the
many parts he played—-actor, commercial
traveller, storekeeper, sheller and, finally,
hotel-proprietor—if he didn’t make money he
never failed to amass friends.
Monty Grover, editor of Melb’s new pic-
torial morning, the Sun, told a gathering of
ink-slingers the other afternoon that he
began scribbling as a contributor to the
Boomerang in the middle ’nineties. The
publication lasted 12 weeks, and by strenu-
ous toil he made about 2s. 4d. a week for
that period. The printer employed was
George Michael Prendergast, present Vic.
Opposition (Labor) Leader, and the office
was near the Waterloo Victor pub, which, by
the way, is handy to the new Sun office.
“Lexite”: Senior-Sergeant Costigan, for
38 years attached to Paddington, a man of
a rich brogue, a large family, a great capa-
city for “bulls” and a way wid him in deal-
ing with “th’ lahr-r-rikin iliment,” has just
passed out, aged 74. He was one of the
best-known bobbies in Sydney. Years ago a
friend of mine complained about some neigh-
boring roughs, and appealed to Costigan to
suppress them. “Oi’m not shure Oi c’n do
thot,” said Costigan, "but Oi’ll put a shtop
to them.”
Lemmon, who has represented Williams-
town in the Vic. Assembly since 1904, has
an activity that increases with his years, and
he has now been appointed chairman of the
State Public Accounts Committee. He is
a former chief president of the Australian
National Ass., and was Minister for Educa-
tion and Labor in the Elmslie Seven-days*
W< nder Ministry.
“0.K.”: The late G. R. Sims was the most
intimately known of all journalists that ever
were or will be. Every week for 45 years he
wrote three columns in the Referee, mainly
about himself and his recollections, an
achievement which is not likely to be sur-
passed. Growlers may have said that
“Dagonet’s” stuff had degenerated into mere
piffle, whatever the term may mean; but,
during the last 20 of those 45 years of chat-
tering, Sims had an ever-enlarging stock of
experiences to be drawn upon by a strong
memory, and a bigger accumulation of
selected anecdotes for reference. The most
successful of his melodramas, “Lights o’
London” (which practically restored an old-
fashioned type of serio-comic drama to the
English stage), “Romany Rye” and “Harbor
Lights” (written in collaboration with Pet-
titt) had lots of Australian popularity in
their time. Also, the most ambitious of his
HENRY LAWSON, at about the time he wrote “While
the Billy Boils” (1898).
dramatic works, a piay called “Esther San-
draz,” was produced here by the ill-fated
Amy Roselle; and when George Musgrove
imported a Gaiety Burlesque Co., wherein
Lonnen and Robert Courtneidge were chief
comedians, the opening burlesque, “Faust
Up-to-date,” was a contraption by Sims and
Pettitt. His “Dagonet Ballads” had their
brief vogue in this country, as elsewhere,
about 40 years ago, but they were cheap, and
parody soon killed them.
J. S. Rogers, who lately left Melbourne
for the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge,
was educated at the Pimpinio (Vic.) State
School and Bendigo High, took a two-years’
course in arts, science and education in the
Teachers’ Training College in 1911, and
after three years’ work as a High-school
expert annexed his B.A. degree. He went
as a private to the war, became a brigade-
major (Tanks) and got an M.C. His scho-
lastic record comprises the B.Sc., the M.Sc.,
the Frederick Knight Research Scholarship,
the 1851 Scholarship, and the Dixon Prize
in Natural Philosophy. Rogers travelled to
England on one of the P. and O. free pas-
sages awarded to brilliant students for fur-
ther development abroad, and is now head-
ing for the Doctorate of Philosophy, pro-
bably with the ultimate object of securing
a chair.
“Abbot Park”: An old-time gold-digger,
who pegged out his last claim at Temora
(N.S.W.) the other day, was John O’Dell,
known as “Coolgardie Jack” through having
delved on the western field in the boom days.
He followed the game in Bananaland arid
N. S. Wales, and once lifted a nugget pan-
ning out at £3OO. He broke up rapidly at
the end and died alone at 85.
C. Coral : Passed on the other day, old
the /Ar last survivor of the Rennel
Islanders (Mauar, Torres Strait), at 80
years or thereabouts. In Susui’s earlv days
the Rennel people used to indulge in' flesh-
“if Col P s e-grease-drinking banquets,
L. n ma^e “an strong,” and the other niggers
still speak fear-
fully of Rennel as
the “plenty bad
island.” _ Disease
and fighting nearly
wiped out the
population eventu-
ally, and the few
survivors went to
other islands,
but too late to
build up again as
the Torres Strait
population is now
doing generally.
Susui himself
worked as a “skin-
diver” for many
years when the
ocean’s wealth be-
came known.
M. McGREGOR, a
new Victorian
M.L.C.
“W.”: W. A. Trenwith the other day
drifted into the Vic. Assembly to dis-
cover not more than a dozen men of
his time still there. lie used to be the most
lucid debater in the House, but Jack Mur-
ray, Shiels and others also shone by compari-
son with the present lot, while John Gavan
Duffy and barrister Andrews, of Geelong, sup-
plied an effervescent wit in which the stolid
Chamber is now woefully deficient.
Gone west. William Vero Read, one-time
Chief Traffic-manager N. S. Wales Rail-
ways, and eldest son of John Cecil Read,
for many years governor of Darlinghurst
Gaol. The family claims descent from the
Rev. Sir John Read, Bart., of Stephens
Green, Dublin, and Moynoe House, County
Clare. John Cecil Read, who was the son
of the clerical baronet, never used the title,
but the recently-dead man did, after his
father’s death, occasionally use it. He was
83 at his death.
“The Deacon” : Jabez Wright was by far
the most unconventional Mayor Broken Hill
ever experienced. His free-and-easy poise
was generally approved, but even the “Hill”
thought he overdid it when the Chelmsfords
visited the town. The collarless undertaker
rose to the occasion by appearing in his
pyjamas, and with a spacious gesture offer-
ing the Governor the freedom of both the city
and its pubs. Undeterred by the icy dis-
dain of Lady Chelmsford, Jabez invited her
to join him in a spot or two and enjoy herself
generally. Chelmsford, a shrewd judge of
character, entered into the joke, but his lady
remained uncompromisingly hostile. At the
vice-regal procession of welcome Jabez led
the van on the box-seat of one of his hearses.
Sydney-native Louis Samuel Cohen, an
alderman and ex-Lord Mayor of Liverpool
(Eng.), died last week. He was the son
of the late Samuel Cohen, who represented
Morpeth in the third N. S. Wales Parlia-
ment. Louis C. was noted for his large
gifts to Liverpool charities. Ilis brother,
George Judah Cohen, of Sydney, is now in
his 81st year.
William Dickson, sec. of Vic. Mines Dept.,
who inquired into the muddle at Pentridge,
was born in a tent on a Heathcote mining
field. He was one of his State’s best police
magistrates, and has been roped in for
various inquiries since he became Mines
Secretary, many years ago. He was loaned
to the Tas. Government as a Royal Com-
missioner. and to fix up the fuss about the
Branxholm-Scotsdale railway; as a. Com-
mission he looked into the complaints of
people who failed on Vic. closer settlement
blocks, and he was chairman of the Pentridge
Inquiry Board a couple of years back.
Despite all this he can tell a good yarn, and
has one of the heartiest laughs in Mel-
bourne.
“Morehead”: The Rev. George Spencer
Richmond, who ran the ill-fated Warriors’
Friend campaign, got his holy training at St.
Augustine’s College, Canterbury, and Dur-
ham ’Varsity. He then came to Australia,
and did some curating at Wagga and Surry
Hills (N.S.W.). From 1916 till 1919 he
was temporary chaplain, and before the end
of the Big War was a chaplain-major
attached to the 33rd Batt. On returning he
was for a while offsider to R. B. S. Ham-
mond at St. Barnabas’s, Sydney.
“Chris”: Chas. Viner Hill, who recently
passed out, aged 84, at Onehunga (M.L.),
in his 85th year, was born in Surry Hills,
Sydney, and had been in Auckland since
infancy. He crossed the Tasman on the
barque Anne Watson with his father, one of
the mechanics engaged by Capt. Hobson, the
Rickety Isles’ first Governor, and the vessel
called at Russell to take Hobson and party
to Auckland, the new capital.
THE DROP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“England’s hangman, Ellis, is deeply annoyed by
the report that he and other executioners drink
brandy as a “bracer” before executions.” — Cable.
They hearten up the shuddering wretch,
Around whose neck the rope must pass.
They give him brandy by the glass—
But none may shout a drink for Ketch.
I see the sheriff pull his watch
With shaking hand from out his fob;
And seek some stomach for a job
That he abominates, in Scotch.
Gaol governors with sherry brown
May wet dry lips. They never ask
If that fell horror in a mask
Could keep a modest quencher down.
The gents who represent the press
(Offered of stimulants their choice)
May quite intelligibly voice
A modest preference for Guinness.
The chaplain looks a trifle pale.
His saintly nerve would seem on edge.
A glass of port for him to pledge
The frowning doctor of the gaol!
’Tis right that each a bracer has,
Whose most immediate affair
Is to observe upon the air
A hapless fellow-biped jazz.
All save that apparition grim,
Whose hand shall soon the lever seize.
Some ancient precedent decrees
No bumper may be frothed for him,.

THE TEST.
"What do you think of that Chap Johnston?”
“ Well — er—I suppose he's all right — but —I— er”-
“I quite agree with you. He wouldn't lend me a, shilling
either.”
Sydney Telegraph has a commendable
record for doing its best to boost the Aus-
tralian writer. Arthur Adams, Ethel
Turner and other Sydney novelists have been
given a chance by this" paper with serials
paid for, if not adequately, at any rate, on
a scale far superior to that w r hich rules in
respect of the Penny Novelette rubbish that
dailies such as the S. M. Herald still im-
port from .London. The repertory movement
has always had a useful friend in the Tele-
graph, and its latest move is to offer 100
guineas for the best Australian play sub-
mitted to a bench composed of Oscar Asehe.
Professor MacCallum and the editor (Farmer
Whyte). If Australia holds any hitherto
mute and inglorious Galsworthy or Shaw
this is his opportunity to seize fame and
fortune, for plays by writers in Broome or
Brisbane will get equal consideration with
work produced in Sydney; and the three
judges constitute an exceptional combination
for the purpose of estimating both the liter-
ary and acting values of a play.

“Morehead’s” Chelmsford Stakes day
vignette:—
A benevolent council clears the garbage-tins in
my district at stated intervals. Two grimy and
be-whiskered dirtmen, plus an antiquated tipdray, a
heavy, shaggy draught-horse, a clanging cow-bell and
a unique collection of adjectives, all lurid, comprise
the outfit, which usually arrives about 8.30 a.m.
Last Saturday the noise of the bell burst upon the
' neighborhood at 7 sharp, its insistent clamor sug-
gesting breathless hurry on the part of the expedi-
tionary force. Naturally, many citizens, unprepared
for the untimely onslaught, were literally caught
napping, and a number of boxes yielded no harvest
to the reapers. But there was one conscientious
householder, a small and weedy chap, who pursued
the cart and its smellful load, stumbling under an
extra heavy burden of offal. His braces trailed be-
hind, his bootlaces were untied, his hair fell in
wild dishevelnient over his face, and all the time
he called upon the ministers of sanitation to pull
up. As they aid so, and he deposited his reeking
burden at their feet, the driver glared at him and
then broke out fiercely, as one tried past all human
endurance: “Gor strewtli, yer blanky ’ot, ain’t, yer?
Ovv do yer expect blokes to be in time to see
Beauford win if they’re to be pulled up every inch
by blighters like vouse?”
“Kobbi”: Goohdiwiudi CQ*). where as-
tronomers are hurrying with drayloads of
instruments, for a dress-circfe view of the
eclipse, is a case of a town having greatness
thrust upon it. After the fuss is over and
Einstein’s bent-light theory has received
either a boost or a jolt, “Gundy,” as its citi-
zens call it, will settle down again to its
normal obscurity. The town sits astride
the Mclntyre River, right on the N. ,S.
Wales border, and occasionally has such
downpours of water that it gets its picture
in the weeklies.
* * * ir
“Bilbav”: In answer to “T.W.” (B.
31/8/’22>, who asks “how many of the
Allies’ soldiers saw a bit of fresh pig from
beginning to end of their service,” I hasten
to reply: “The Russian Relief Force.” In
it fresh meat was as
scarce as beef in Hell,
and we almost lived on
pork. It was pickled,
certainly, but on troop-
ships allegedly fresh pork
was on the menu twice a
week —I’ve been on five of
them, arid it was the same
on all—and it figured in
training-camp menus in
England, both A.I.F. and
Imperial.
* *•
“Tin Hat”: The evil
influence exerted by a
certain type of bad-man
film on juvenile minds
may be said to have re-
coiled on itself, in a
manner of speaking, when
on a recent occasion the
management of a Mel-
bourne suburban theatre
was stunned by the dis-
covery that the 13th epi-
sode of its weekly serial
picture had mysteriously
disappeared. Nothing was
left but to announce the
fact to a disgusted audi-
ence, and call in the local
John Hop. That officer,
evidently a student of
Sherlock Holmes’s deduc-
tive" methods, wasted no
time in constructing
theories. He went
straight to the local
school and got the dom-
inie to ask the kids casu-
ally if they knew anyone
who could get him a small
piece of film. A boy im-
mediately produced a
fragment of the lost
serial, which he had been
given by another boy. A
few minutes’ talk with
the second youngster, and
the missing property (valued at £100) was
produced, unharmed, from its cache in a kero-
sene-tin hidden among the weeds along the
railway-line. At a visit paid to the boy’s
home the police found a room fitted up accord-
ing to his idea of a movie palace, with screen,
magic-lantern, etc., all complete. The next
act will be screened in the Children’s Court.
“D.F.”: The oldest tombstone still
extant in the Speck is a slab of
blue-gum which records the death in'
1808, of Mary Mack, housekeeper to Robert
Ivnopwood, the first colonial chaplain. It
is run very close, however, by a stone mem-
orial at Crayfish Point,
on the Derwent, a few
miles below Hobart.
This is sacred to the
memory of the mate of
the whaler Venus, com-
manded by Captain Ebor
Bunker, one of the pion-
eers of whaling in Aus-
tralian waters.
SPECIALLY QUALIFIED.
“Why did you leave your last position?”
“I had been out to dinner with the chief,
and ”-
“That's good enough for me. Start after
lunch.”
“Prof.”: For the benefit of “Dunederra”
(B. 7/9/’22) and others tvho may be equally
credulous of the efficacy of various forms of
alleged “sex-detectors,” let me state that a
steady hand will invariably cause a neuter
or negative verdict. I’ve tried tlie threaded
needle, as well as several other recom-
mended devices. All proved to be equally
useless for the purpose of indicating sex.
inasmuch as they one and all persisted in
remaining perfectly motionless when held
over any article whatever, be it an egg, a
live or a totally inanimate object. In
some hands, of coarse, any device will give
the anticipated verdict owing to involuntary
muscular movement induced by belief, or
even expectation. In short, the phenomenon
is entirely a subjective one, and has nothing
whatever to do with the sex of the article
in question. Numerous forms of “sex-
detectors” have had their advocates of late,
from needles, collar-studs and wedding-rings
suspended by cotton or hair, to the more
expensive plumbobs vended by American
quacks. In fact, any old thing seems to
do, the only essentials being a lack of under-
standing and a due degree of misplaced
faith.

“Billy T.”: How’s this for the Hardluck
Stakes? A St. Kilda. (Vic.) man. who did
rather more than his fair whack against
Fritz, returned to find that his erring wife
had had two children in his absence, who
could not by any stretch of possibilities be
his. The dame had funked on the approach-
ing home-coming of her husband; had suc-
ceeded in inducing the Neglected Children’s
Department to take over the encumbrances ;
and, after entering them up in the name of
the wronged man, had scuttled with the
partner of her sin, as it is sometimes
put. Now the husband is to be sued
by the Department for the maintenance
°t the neglected babes which are not
his. The distracted man pleads that tin*
war has not left him in good nick, and
declares that lie has enough to do to main-
tain himself and those children which arc
admittedly his, but the Department insists
that the youngsters are on the books in his
name, and he will have to keep them or go
to gaol.
"Harold Hardupp”: The inter-Stute ex-
change system of detectives, which has been
given a trial for a good
part of the last year, is
doing more to break the
heart of Bill Sikes and
his friends than any other
recent form of police
activity. luside of a few
days it resulted in one
criminal being arrested
in Brisbane, two in Syd-
ney, three in Melbourne
and one in Adelaide —all
men against whom war-
rants had been out for
some time. The new sys-
tem is just one of those
which apparently was not
tried before because it
was so simple and obvi-
ous. There are few really
skilful criminals who do
not become well known
to the police in the city
where they operate; yet
there was scant protec-
tion for the public when
the marked man could
make a fresh start, un-
marked, in a new city as
soon as the old one be-
came too hot for him.
N.S.'W. prisons are hold-
ing a man to-day who.
slightly over a year ago.
was released as a first
offender. At that time lie
was believed to be n
Maoriland product. Caught in a second
offence, he was identified by a Melbourne
detective (in Sydney on exchange) as a
man with a Victorian record sinister enough
to almost place him in a class of his own.

“Ali Selim” on the drink question:—
No prohibitionist I, but honesty compels the
admission that the Turk, as a horrible example of
teetotalism, is a dud. He lias never been much
more than a ceremonial Mahometan. In fact,
some of the strict Mussulmen of Egypt and Arabia
look on him as an unbeliever. The prohibition
against the use of alcohol is, in general, strictly
observed both by Shiah and Sunni. The Bedouin
petty larceiiist, the treacherous Afghan and his
cousin the Pathan cut-throat are all co-believers
with Pussyfoot. On the other hand, some of the
Egyptian Pashas—-especially if they possess Turkish
blood—will crack a bottle of the right stuff with
anyone. I have not come across Mahomet’s list
of forbidden drinks mentioned by “P.0.W.” (B.
24/8/'22), nor have I heard of the contention that
arrack and pyramid beer, not being on the official
wine list, can be taken by the true believer with-
out danger to his soul. Still, as one who knows
Jaeko passing well, I can quite believe it. It is just the
sort of point that would delight the hearts of the
learned imaums of A 1 Azhar. They are as fond of
splitting hairs as any Scottish theologian. For
example, one party of Hig-heT Critics put forward
the theory that the prohibition against stabbing a
man in the back after having eaten bread and salt
with him was not intended to apply to dealings with
unbelievers. (A variant this of the Christian- doc-
trine —supported by at least one Papal Bull—that

to keep faith with heretics and infidels is unneces-
sary.) A 1 Koraan resembles the source of Eng-
land’s Greatness in that, if one tackles it in the
right spirit and brings sufficient industry and
imagination to the task, it will be found to author-
ise practically anything. It is on record that on
one occasion the Prophet himself, like Noah, became
gloriously inked, and in much the same circum-
stances. And one can be sure that he had Divine
authority for his spree, and all sorts of texts to
prove that the whole affair was inspired by the
highest religious motives.

A WORD FROM WOLLONGONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Trenchantly criticising the practice of birth-con-
trol, the Rev. D. J. Knox, Rural Dean of Wollon-
gong, declares that it is “a deplorable thing to see
young married women selling their perambulators
and cots and buying golf-clubs and motor-cars.”
The squatter whips the world in wool
That falls, in folds from fleecy flocks;
The wheat to bake the bread of Bull,
In bursting sacks the cockle stocks;
But, brethren, keep your cradles full,
Admonishes the Rev’rend Knox.
Attend and roll the ball along;
The word is passed from Wollongong.
The choice is made, the knot is tied,
The way is clear, the bonus waits.
Our empty lands are wild and wide,
Enough for thrice the tale of States;
To keep the alien hordes outside
There must be men to man the gates.
Increase—and fear nor Jap nor Pong!
Prescribes the Dean of Wollongong.
Let godless medieoes extol
Malthusian methods, modes and means
That point the path to birth-control;
Such doctrine doesn't do for Deans.
Shall selfish comfort be your goal V
Tell that, he says, to the marines.
Out on such wicked, wanton wrong!
The protest comes from Wollongong.
Ilis stalwart soul is plunged in woe.
He shudders sore from head to heels
AVhen matrons sell the carts that go
(Or should) to treble pipes and squeals,
And dissipate forthwith the dough
In luxuries like Hupmobiles.
(Unless the Dean’s reported wrong,
Cars must be cheap at Wollongong.)
And when they swap unwanted cots
(Obedient to fashion’s freaks)
That should be holding tiny tots
For drivers, mashies, niblicks, cleeks—
Things useless save for golfing shots —
The scalding tears run down his cheeks.
(It must, indeed, be extra-strong,
The craze for golf at Wollongong.)
The knots are tied, the cradles wait,
From every church file forth the wed ;
The Jap may soon be at the gate,
The blame and shame upon the head
Of couples who recall (too late)
The hands lie waved, the words he said
Of warning to the giddy throng.
The Rural Dean of Wollongong.

“Niger”: Some very ancient history was
quoted by Dr. Nash in the N.S.YV. Council
the other day in reference to an ancestor
of R. .1. Black, M.L.CJ. However, the medico-
legislator got his facts a little mixed. John
Black sailed for Sydney in 1797 as purser
of the Lady Shore, which carried GO women
convicts, a notorious swindler of the day
named Major Semple, and a scratch lot of
guards, mostly French deserters and discon-
tented Irish. In the South Atlantic the sol-
diers and some of the seamen, egged on by
the women, seized the vessel, killed the cap-
tain and put Black and the rest, who would
not join them, adrift in the longboat. Some
of the mutineers argued that it would be
a waste of good tucker to put any provi-
sions into the boat, as those in it would
never reach land anyway. However, the
others were less thrifty, and the longboat did
eventually hit the coast of Brazil. As to
the Lady Shore, the mutineers took her into
FELINE.

sight it. He sold The Harbinger to the Gov-
ernment, and leased a patch of ground in
Sydney. But he soon went to sea again, and
in 1803 he sailed from Calcutta for Port
Jackson in a vessel called The Fly, which
never reached port.

“Dido”: I was waiting for my tram,
and noticed him go into the prim subur-
ban garden. I saw his suppliant attitude
when the lady of the house
appeared, a tall frame of a
female, with a face of rein-
forced concrete. There were
a few remarks, warm on
the woman’s side, appealing
on that of the bedraggled
mendicant, and then the
woman suddenly disclosed a
man’s wal k i n g-s tic k,
snatched from the hallstand.
With it she went for the
appellant. She beat the
hapless wretch to the gate,
and there administered a
kick aft that precipitated
him into the gutter. He sat
up there, and there he had
the last word. “I’m sick,
ma’am,” he cried; “I am
hungry, penniless and friend-
less, but there is one thing
in which I have a tremen-
dous advantage over your
husband. Thank God, you
are no wife of mine!”

“Frinigga”: Gambling on
the weather is now a recog-
nised amusement in the
U.S.A. It began, soundly
enough, with amusement
caterers and others, who em-
bark a lot of capital in
things that depend for suc-
cess on absence of rain, cov-
ering themselves by insur-
ing against its coming on
some particular day. There
is still a pretence of an “in-
surable interest,” but this
can be claimed by the owner
of a peanut-stall, or even
the golfer who says he is
going to play some sort of
a match. As a fact, it has
got down to plain betting,
the company laying against
rain. The small odds are,
for a summer day, about S to
1; that is, the insurer “pays
a premium of 12 per cent.” The wet Fourth
of July this year must have cost the layers
anything up to a million dollars. The only
thing that seems likely to kill the sport is
the wrangle constantly arising when a day,
which is to all intents and purposes fine, has
a shower somewhere in it.
The so-called convict ship Success —which
did nothing more sensational in its life than
house, in relative comfort, the convicts who
worked on the Williamstown breakwater in
the ’fifties—is being exploited in a new
direction. Recently the New York Sun had
this advt.:—
Twenty-five thousand dollars will be paid to the
man brave enough to endure solitary confinement for
one week in cell 64 on the lower deck of the convict
ship now at the Battery. The prisoner will be
ironed in leg-chains, fed on bread and water, have
but one hour out of 24 for exercise, and live and
sleep on the floor of the cell in the same manner
that real prisoners were treated in the old days.
Apply Manager, Convict Ship, the Battery, New York.
Nothing like this happened on the old craft,
nor did she feature the weird implements of
torture with which the Yanks have filled her.
It is a fearsome thing for a vessel to lead
a respectable life, on the whole, and then
descend to the status of a dime-museum.

Copabella”: Never is the Law a bigger
“hass” than in its devotion to legal jargon
when dealing with illiterates, foreigners and
defendants who appear “the morning after.”
Phraseology in, say, the charge of valueless-
cheque passing would puzzle a teetotal pro-
fessor of old English. When commonsense,
street-side Australian is given a chance,
the results are always satisfactory.
Recently in a Court which I infest some-
what, after the clerk had recited his incan-
three times, the police-sergeant chipped
with: “Was y’ drunk lahs’ night?”
Course I was drunk,” retorted the defen-
dant; “didn’cha see me?” Fined 5s A
ship’s captain who sought the Bench’s per-
mission to be his own cross-examiner of
accused beat the clerk with three “tries” to
spare. “You tellum me go to b Hell?”
he asked a mixed dockful of Finns. Swedes,
Letts and skewbalds. They grinned relief
and acquiescence, and took their fiver fines
as though they were favors.

“Tren” on trees:—
Captain Masson was not the first to plant gums in
Palestine, as alleged (B. 31/8/’22). They were a
feature of that holy and flea-infested landscape when,
in 1917, we pushed Jacko off it. Cameliers and
Light Horsemen, whose initial glimpse of civilisation
after their long sojourn in the desert was the Jewish
colony of Riehon-le-Zion, will never forget their first
sight of the gums that grew in the main street there
a street, by the way, since re-named, in their
honor, Anzac-avenue. In December, 1917, the led
camels of the Cameliers were left a mile from the
trenches at Ibna Abrak, a collection of mud huts
splendidly screened by a breakwind of sugar-gums.
And, nearly a year later, whilst waiting to charge
into what proved to be this last stunt, many Light
Horse regiments sharpened their swords among
Australian trees in and near the grounds of the
Jewish Agricultural College, Yazur. Often as gum-
trees were seen, one never ceased to thrill at the
sight or odor of them; and, to the last, the aroma
fiom a handful of leaves thrown on the fire was a
poignant delight. Symmetrical currajongs grew in
™ a , of r the better Jaffa streets, and, though but
10ft. high, were pro'ably as old as the nearbv
gums, for these trees are but slow growers. Dinkum
wattles were certainly few, but several varieties were
to be seen at Yazur, Sarona, and villages near the
\\adi Auja. A shrub, grown as a hedge from Gaza
to Damascus, was worshipped as an Aussie wattle by
many a Digger, for it had golden, globular flowers,
and an odor that took one straight back to
the bush. It was, however, one of the many acacias
native to Palestine. The fact that Australian trees
have been chosen for the re-afforestation of the Holy
Land should convince bad Australians of their sur-
passing beauty, utility and value, for that country
is the home of many noble trees, a list of which
would contain the names of palms, myrtles, acacias,
the sycamore, oak, walnut, olive, almond, fig, pom-
egranate; and, in the north, the cedar, storax, from
the bark of which is produced the stacte used in
holy incense, and Lawsonia alba, from the leaves of
which is produced henna, the famous cosmetic.

“Tauwarra”:—
“In Moresby we met many of the Younger Sons,
the men to whom the Empire owes so much....to
such as these Britain must largely attribute her
pre-eminence as a coloniser. It was 'good to he with
these polished, sunburnt men, who sat in their
dinner-jackets and told in casual sentences of trips
into the Fly River country, where human skulls
decoiate roof trees, and where death is given as
readily as a word. . . .There was no pose about these
men.... They were true to type. You will find them
wherever the tropic sun is greeted by the Flag. They
make you feel good to be a Britisher.”
Thus Dale Collins, late of Melbourne, in the course
of a series of articles describing Papua as it isn’t, in
the London Daily Mail. Even granting that this
kind of snobbish slush is acceptable in England,
Collins should have had more self-respect and sense
than to supply it. The Younger Son deserves a
chapter to himself in the history of Papuan coloni-
sation, but the distinction will not inspire envy if
the chapter contains the truth. Fortunately for the
country, the supply of Younger Sons was cut off at
the meter when Downing-street handed over Papua
to the Commonwealth, and in these days their
memories are preserved only in the ledgers of sorrow-
ing creditors and in the school-registers of the mis-
sionaries to whom they bequeathed their piebald off-
spring One member of the precious brotherhood
was a magistrate stationed on the N.-E. Coast. I
met him once, on patrol, when his costume consisted
of a khaki coat, a white helmet and blueher boots.
A grinning corporal carried his taubada’s pants,
and a bottle of O.P. rum. Naturally this coloniser's
name did not remain long on the Government pay-
roll, and he eventually ended his career on the
beach. Another scion of a noble house —an old
Etonian —got six months’ hard for abducting a Hula
girl. Captain Blank, late of the Nth Hussars (as
his card conclusively proved), is chiefly remembered
at Samarai for the facility with which he could
palm an ace—an accomplishment by no means to
THE LESSER EVIL.
DAUGHTER : “ Mother's thinking of stocking a
cellar."
FATHER: “I thought she was opposed to

be despised when one remembers the old hands
who frequented “Billy the Cook’s” in the early
days. The pacification of Papua is now all but an
accomplished fact. It is an All-Australian triumph
shared equally by the district officers, the miners
and the mission societies. The Younger Son, of
the type familiar to readers of Charles Garviee, was
never, at any time, a factor in the process, and his
share of the credit could be recorded on I*he back
of a postage-stamp—with a vhitewash brush.
THE DEEPER GRIEF .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Speak to me not ol' perjured men,
Nor deem such trifles vex
One steeped in anguish past belief,
Aye, ravaged by the deepest grief
That lacerates my sex.
Thick you mere lovers move us so?
We laugh their wiles to scorn.
But, ah, tlie wardrobe.' That has arts
To agonise the stoutest hearts
And make the wisest mourn.
What is a vow, a smile, a kiss.
To her whose soul has been,
In brutal wise, abhorrent, rude,
Reft by the woven tuipitude
Of some sham crepe de Chine?
What compensates for gloves that rip ?
For velveteens that rub?
For fickle muslins that deceive,
And pale, perfidious prints that leave
Their beauty in the tub?
If lawns and linens never crushed,
And tulles were always nice;
If tender laces time withstood
Men might do whatsoe’er they would—
Earth would be Paradise.
But here, in this imperfect world,
We suffer silken sins,
And crocheted curses, knitted doles,
The faithlessness of buttonholes,
The treachery of pins.
Speak not to me of perjured men,
Far deeper grief I know—
Grief that no lover can console—
My new silk stockings have a hole!
This, this is rea] woe.

“M. Magee” : Re “Bogan Bill” on Binghi’s
rough-and-ready treatment of his sick (B. 17/8/’22).
The Abo. is pretty rough and ready in other matters
too, and his methods are often effective. A few
years ago, on Avon Downs station (N.T.), a gin
was troubled with what her dusky lord diagnosed
as “too much walkabout”; so one night, when she
made a belated appearance in the camp, he broke
both her ankles and held her feet in the fire until
they were half-roasted. I saw her about six months
later. She was a bit bow-legged and waddled like
a lame duck, but had relinquished her “walkabout”
habits. On the same station about the same time,
a buck, annoyed at night by the wailing of one
of his offspring, grabbed the infant by one leg and
after knocking its brains out against a rock, cut
its throat, and slept the rest of the 'night in peace.
* * * * *
“Murknh”: A cow belonging to Dave
Markiss, of Numurkah (Vic.), recently produced five
calves, three male and two female. All were dead, prob-
ably the result of the cow being chased by a heeling
cattle-dog just previously. Two years ago she brought
three to light, two female and one male. All lived.
The previous year her tally was two. Total, 10
calves in three years. A record, surely?
• • • •
“Poppin” : This is the history of the Gov-
ernor marriage (B. 7/9/’22). One Page, a casual
worker in the Gulgong (N.S.W.) district,' married
a well-educated English girl, who taught music and
occasionally played at dances. They had nine child-
ren, among them Ethel, a little fair-haired girl
with blue eyes. Old Page wasn’t over fond of graft,
and the family camped on the bank of the river,
opposite the camp of the abo. Tommy Governor and
his two children, Joe and Jimmy Governor. Jimmy
and Ethel got mixed up, and approached the local
parson, who was willing, and though many of the
residents protested, my mother among them, the
pair were married in St. Luke’s Church, Gulgong.
They afterwards went out Breelong way to do a job
fencing, and it was on account of gibes at his wife,
who was certainly not a quadroon, that Jimmie
started on his slaughtering. Years afterwards I saw
the fair Ethel in an abo. camp down the South Coast.
• • * *
“King Kurragong”: “Wang’s” yarn (B.
24/8/’22) of Danny, who wanted to prove by means
of a waybill to his team that they had to pull only
one ton, reminds me of a bullocky who got glued
in the black soil near Deniliquin (N.S.W.). Every-
thing he tried to make his team put forth further
efforts proved futile. The bullocks reckoned they
were beaten, and let it go at that. At last, in
despair, with tears of rage trickling down his
weatherboard countenance, Bill planked a pound-
note on the ground under the leaders’ noses, then
went back and stuck his head down in front of the
wheel. “There yer are, yer blanketty, blank blanks,”
he roared. “Bet yer a flamin’ quid yer can’t pull
the blanky thing over me!” The team wasn’t bet-
ting.
“E.N.”: “Jim Carew” (B. 3/8/’22) says
Nubling “is wrong in saying the lyre-
bird won’t have anything red or white
in his bower.” I presume he means
a bower-bird, concerning whose color
predilections the original reference
was made. There are, however, about
10 species in Australia, and they
differ somewhat in their choice of
bower decorations. My own experi-
ences relate solely to the satin bower-
bird in National Park (N.S.W.), and
in 25 bowers found there, many of
which I kept under extended observa-
tion, I never saw a single red object;
and when such was experimentally
introduced, the bird always promptly
threw it out. White I have only
found in combination with blues,
never by itself. If “Jim Carew’s”
bower, which had 90 per cent, of
red ornaments and some additional
bits of white, was not that of the
spotted bower-bird his find is certainly
interesting, as I believe that the
satin bower-bird’s' objection to red
has some relation to the bird’s blue
iris. As to “Sinbad” (B. 24/8/’22),
he too seems to have got a bit mixed
in the species. I have never heard
of lyre-birds collecting any articles
for decoration. Neither do they build
bowers, and their dancing mounds, of
which I have seen many scores, are made of loose
earth pure and simple.
* * * •
“FY7”: It is something new to hear of a
mantis eating small nesting birds (B. 27/7/’22),
though the beastie is one of the most terrible car-
nivores of the insect world. Like the scorpion and
the spider, the lady mantis eats her wedding break-
fast on her own, Mr. Mantis being the breakfast.
She is a lot more sudden than either of the others,
however, for she snips his head off before the bridal
kiss has exceeded half the film-censor’s allowance.
* * * •
“F.H.R.”: About 35 years ago a miner
known as “Harry the Hatter” put in a tunnel single-
handed near Norrendoc station (N.S.W.). That
wasn’t quite so remarkable as the fact that he wore
his beard tied up in knots. When let out it reached
well below his knees, which must have given him
over 3ft. of whisker. Can any Abo. dig up a
heftier ziff ?
* * * *
“Park”: A station-owner in the north (S.
Aus.) has a photo of a piccaninny sucking milk
from a nanny-goat. It was taken near the police-
station at Anthony’s Lagoon. The youngster was
three days old when his mother died, and the gins
on the station decided the easiest method for them
was to install Nanny as foster-mother. The goat
took on the job with pleasure and grew very fond
of its adopted kid. Early every morning the animal
would bleat for the piccaninny, and, when the child
arrived, would lie down to enable him to operate.
After that they went off together, and were usually
inseparable for the rest of the day. When the
picture was taken the nipper was two years old
and still drawing a regular issue of milk.
THE HUMANITARIAN.
BOSS: “ Look how clean he's shearing! Why, his sheep are laughing at yours."
ABO.: “By cripes, boss, if it turns cold to-night my sheep’ll be laughing at his.”
“R.R.”: T. W. Gooch, one of the oldest
settlers in this (Mildura, Vic.) district, claims to
have let go the first rabbit in Australia, at Inverlie,
18 miles from Geelong (Vic.), in 1858. Does the
Abo. qouncil endorse the claim?
The Oldest Inhabitant,” to whom the above was
submitted, writes: It is utterly impossible to say
who released the first rabbit in Australia. At
Dubbo (N.S.W.), a couple of years ago, or maybe
more —time with me runs awfully quickly—a man
boasted that he “let go” the first rabbit, at John
(or James) Austin’s, Barwon Park, near Geelong
(Vic.). I paragraphed that in The Bulletin. I
think the Dubbo man was a visitor, so possibly he
may be Gooch, of Mildura. The Austins, of Barwon
Park, have always had the “credit” of introducing
Bunny and breeding him wholesale. The Duke
of Edinburgh, in 1868, had a day’s shooting at the
Park, and killed hundreds of cotton-tails. The poor
devils were wired in and had no hope of escape.
* * # *
“J.G.8.”: When Bill Bramlee went into
town for a few days’ spell Mrs. Publichouse asked
him if he’d mind sharing a room with “Nigger”
Telfoot, a gentleman whose reputation was rather
variegated. Bill didn’t mind ; but it was a more or
less curious fact that he retired earlier than Telfoot
every night, and slept in each morning until his
room-mate had left. As Bramlee’s holiday wore on
“Nigger” developed a distracted look, as of a man
assailed by an insoluble problem. Then, on the
last morning Bill got up early, went over to Telfoot's
bed, and said, “I want my money.” “I haven’t got
your money,” growled “Nigger.” “Yes, you have- —-
roll over” ; and, putting his hand under the mattress,

“F.H.R.”: I had just disabled a brown
snake by breaking its back with a stick, when the
missus came running down to say that Spot, the
dog, had a bait. I’d tried various remedies on other
dogs without avail, so this time I took along the
snake (still alive and savage) and tormented it until
it had bitten Spot several times on the front paws.
But Spot collapsed, and for about two hours gave
a death-like imitation of a dog that had died from
poisoning. Then he slowly recovered. My idea in
trying the dodge was that, strychnine being an
antidote for snake-poison, snake-poison should kill
the strychnine. But it isn’t often you have the
snake handy. A curious thing about the business is
that Spot has lost all dislike of snakes, which pre-
viously were his arch-enemies.
“Jim Carew”: In 191 G, on the Upper
Hawkesbury (N.S.M.), I accidentally killed the
female of a pair of jackasses that had a half-grown
family of two near our house. The father promptlv
left the family in the lurch. I got the youngsters
out of the nest and reared them until they were old
enough to shift for themselves; but before lettirg
them loose I placed a small silver ring on a leg of
each. The birds paired, they have never left theiv
home district, and each year they have reared r,
family in the same hollow tree that they were born
in. Their youngsters soon leave them, but the old
birds are still hilariously happy in each other’s com-
pany.

“Frank Dee’’: Te Pana and his two

Friday the two kotiros danced until 4 a.m. at Tan-

COMMUNITY SINGIN'.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We was doin’ pick an’ shovel, out Cunnamulla way,
As rough a crowd o’ navvies as you’d meet in
many a day;
The langwidge, ’struth! ’twas lurid, an’ the gamin’
schools was bad,
An’ the shanties kept the crookest beer, that drove
a bloke stal'k mad.
Yes, such was Dingo Cuttin’, out Cunramulla way.
It was no blinkin’ Band of ’Ope, or John Hops’
holiday,
We was the ’ardest cases as you’d strike from ’ere
to ’ell.
Some bonzer blokes you’d meet out there —some
snags an’ narks as well.
We’d all knocked orf a good ’ard day, an’ got out-
side some scran.
Then poker-schools an’ hazards got us going, every
man,
When a little cove, upon a ’orse, a nifty sort o’
nag,
Came ridin’ past the shanties, wiv the usual kind o’
swag.
We didn’t take much notice, ’cause a stranger’s
nothin’ new-
There’s always some sundowner or shearer passin’
through.
So we ’elped him to some tucker, an’ we went back
to the push
(Me luck was in that night, yer know, an’ twice
I’d held a flush).
But suddenly, we all stopped dead, for, stealin’
though the trees,
We ’card the sound o’ music, an’ it lingered on
the breeze.
“What the ’ell !” —said Ginger Brody, as a bloke
chucked in ’is hand,
Then ’e swallered ’ard an’ puffed ’is pipe, an’ listened
to the band.
THE COST OF IT.
THE BOSS: “Struth! You’re on me slate for a ’undred
pints!”
An’ the tune o’ “Swanee River” came whisperin’
through the air,
Then follered up with “Mary,” an’ “Mother I’ll Be
There.”
Well, you know, a bloke who’s knocked around, an’
roughed it with the mob,
*E ain’t no bloomin’ hangel, but ’is ’eart still
’olds a throb.
So that blokey’s music got us, an’ ’is singin’ sweet
an’ clear
Stirred up some ’idden memory, an’ made our throats
feel queer.
It ends up by the lot of us, all takin’ up the song;
We beefed it out like youngsters—yes, we sang it
right or wrong.
An’ through the spreadin’ gum-trees, out Cunnamulla
way,
We made the still night echo with the songs of
yesterday—
It makes yer feel elated, an’ the gamblin’-sehools
seem tame,
An’ it cleans the cobwebs orf yer soul, does this
darn singin’ game.

“Pat Bushie”: “Booyong” notwithstand-
ing (B. 24/8/’22), I must support “Bogan Bill”
that ducks will dive on to a galvanised-iron rooi
at night, mistaking it for water. I’ve struck sev-
eral cases out in the Darling (N-.5.W.) country.
A dewy galvanised-iron roof looks level when seen
in the moonlight, and this fact “Booyong” has over-
looked. The ducks do slow down a bit when
alighting, but they skim over the water first, and
that at a pretty stiff pace; and as they always
collide with a roof that is sloping towards them they
strike it nearly end-on, which accounts for some
broken necks and limbs. Still, “Bogan Bill’s” 23
dead ducks in one night sounds a bit stiff.
* * . * *
“F.N.R.”: “Picko’s” sheep yarn (B.
24/8/’22) reminds me of a pet ram we had once. lie
used to chase youngsters, and when my sister brought
her nippers over for a week or two we had to
keep him tied up. He was tethered to the shafts
of an old dray, the tail-board of which was facing
the bank of a creek, about six yards away. Some-
thing annoyed him one night, or he felt he wanted
a bit of practice; anyhow, he started butting the
front-board of the dray. I noticed him at it before
I turned in, but thought the darned fool would take
a tumble to himself before morning. When I arose
the turnout was missing. The ram had butted the
dray over the 20ft. bank, and was pinned under it—
dead.

“The Rumpus”: The little black ants of
Australia who carry an unpleasant little bite and
an equally unpleasant little name are hardy insects.
During the summer they gather enough food for
the winter, and when that bleak season arrives
they stay well under cover in their dugouts. Just
to test their hardiness, I placed a few between two
blocks of ice for about 15min. When I brought
them out they were as dead and stiff as any of the
carcases in the refrigerator ; but a few minutes be-
fore the Are thawed them, and they were just as good
little ; black ants as ever.

“Echap”: Inquiries are reaching me
through The Bulletin, from as far apart as West-
ralia and N.Q., as to where metal-cased bullets for
reloading .22 h.v. cartridges can be procured, giving
point to my assertion some time ago that if shooters
knew the cost was not necessarily high they would
acclaim the .22 h.v. an ideal weapon. Mick
Simmons Ltd., Sydney, stock the bullets (or did
when I used to kill ’roos for the elusive crust),
but I never heard of a firm in Australia stocking the
reloading tools. However, the shooter, being a
handy man, can easily adapt the .34-40 tool if he
is anywhere near a bush forge by brazing up the
bullet aperture and reboring to fit the smaller
calibre cartridge neck. (N.B. Don’t compress the

THE CHALLENGE.
RONNIE RABBIT: “Come on, Fairyfeet, an' I’ll give you a game of
draughts."
off the end of the gun won’t recommend the idea
to their mates.)
“Jack Horner”: “Weiry” (B. 24/8/’22)
is quite right when he tells you to be respectful
always to high explosives; but here’s a case of
the opposite kind to that quoted by him. On the
Chaffey Irrigation Area, near Renmark' (S.A.), a
few days ago, a clearing contractor left in the
middle of his block a box containing his lunch,
about 30 plugs of gelignite and a couple of dozen
No. 6 detonators. The latter are articles which should
be treated, not merely with respect, but servility.
A pair of traction-engines (used for ploughing and
weighing over 20 tons each) were shifting, and one
driver, having a constitutional objection to leaving
breakable articles intact, and not knowing' the con-
tents, deliberately ran over the box. The result
was a sort of high explosive pancake, but no explo-
sion. An attempt to induce the driver of the
second engine to repeat the experiment was a dud.
Some people have no interest in scientific research.
AT THE CONCERT.
THE CHAIBMAN (Mr. Fregellis) : “Miss Wearn will now sing
‘Alice, Where ’e To?’”
“Porque” (U.5.A.).: There seems to be
some need of a See-Australia-Next campaign here.
I was recently told by an American professor that
the Australian bushman is the lowest type of
humanity. Another shock came with the news that
the chief difference between Australian and American
dialect is that the Australians speak with more of
a nasal accent. I was so entertained with this
opinion that I got the speaker to repeat it for my
better assurance. A further quickening of the pulse
came at being advised by a Californian down-Stater
that our kangaroo can bend a gun-barrel with his
powerful forepaws. And you are, of course, aware
that on this side of the big drink the eucalyptus is
commonly considered a native of California ?
“Centurion”: “Exul’s” reference (B.
24/8/’22) to the eastern method of fishing with
cormorants recalls that cormorant-fishing, like hawk-
ing, has been practised
in western Europe from
time immemorial, and
still survives as a
sport, even in England,
a Lincolnshire family
named Salvin, for in-
stance, keeping and
training the birds.
According to the
trainer, they are the
easiest of birds to
tame, even if caught
full grown. No ring is
placed around the neck
of the cormorants in
England. The birds are
used for stream fishing
only. When they catch
a fish they must come
to the surface, where
they swallow it head
first. They disgorge
their catch at com-
mand, though if the
trainer sees that the
fish is a perch—which
carries a huge dorsal
fin—the fowl is allowed to keep it. Among the
account rolls of the Royal households still preserved
in England is one of the time of Henry VIII.,
which records disbursements to one John Ward,
“keeper of the King’s cormorants” at the mews
for cormorants and “fishing otters” at the Tower.

“M. Magee”: If “Leo” (B. 20/7/’22)
wants a reliable, sudden-death crow poison let him
add one quarter of a teaspoonful of strychnine, and
double that quantity of carbonate of soda to the
blood of a freshly-killed sheep. Mix thoroughly in
an old tin dish, and partly conceal the vessel under
a bush. Crows simply rush this bait. There is no
vomiting after swallowing—probably the carb. soda
prevents that, and also hastens the effect of the
poison. When casualties commence, those who have
not partaken of the banquet clear out; but if the
black demons are fairly numerous, you can generally
count on getting a half-dozen even' time.

“Billy T.”: The swaggie was leading a
large cattle-dog on a
belt. He went to the
man chopping wood
outside a hut, and
said: “Say, Mister,
’syour name Martin ?’’
The other stopped
chopping, moistened his
palms, and nodded.
“Dan Martin,” he said.
“Did you lose a dorg?”
asked the newcomer.
Martin shook his head.
“No,” was the reply;
“ain’t had a dog for
a year, and then he
wasn’t that sort of
dog.” “I was told
you’d lost a dorg or
somethin’ name o f
Emmer. So I brung
this one along. I found
her, and she comes for
meat if you call her
Emmer. I’ll swear
they told me you lost
a dorg. I’ll on’y charge
harf-a-crown fef m e
trouble—two shillin’s
fer care of dorg, and
sixpence for dorg’s-
meat. Think, ain’t
you lost a dorg?” “I
am thinkin’ ’ard.
There was a Emmer,
but I don’t recollect
no dog. If I lost a dog
I’d remember it bein’
sorter fond of dogs.
No, I ain’t lost noth-
in’.” The man with
the dog seemed hurt;
he imagined he had
been imposed upon.
He went down by the
dam, and camped. In
the morning the mart
from the hut walked
across. “I recomem-
bered durin’ the night,”
he said, “that what I
lost name of Emmer
wan my wife.” He
sighed and added: “But that was more’n a week
ago.”

•‘King Ivnrrajong” ; “Natare” mentions the
curing of a sheep-killer (B. 17/8/’22) by tying him
between two rams. In an old edition of Country
Life I found a letter from a man who had been
advised to try it on a staghound with a taste for
mutton. He used two particularly emphatic rams
with pedigrees attached to them. After watching
the circus for a bit he reckoned the dog was being
duly “learned,” so went in to lunch. When he
came out again he found his dog dying between
two properly minced-up rams, both dead.
* * * *
“Jim Carew”: Re “Centurion” (B.
31/8/’22), on birds mending broken limbs for them-
selves I once shot a soldier-bird that sounded
the alarm just as I was getting a duck within
range, and, on examining him, I noticed that one
leg was closely wrapped in feathers and looked
about six times as thick as the other one. The foot
had been left bare. I pulled the feathers off and
found that the leg had been badly broken just
above the joint, probably by a stone from a catapult.
The flesh had all been cut open, too. The feathers
were stuck over the break and the cut—small, downy
ones at first, but the outside ones much bigger and
stronger. The bone had started to mend when I
saw it, but the bird had apparently made no attempt
to get the broken ends into position, and had it
knitted he would have always been lopsided. This
is the only case I have ever come across: but I have
often seen birds with only one leg, the other one
having bebn broken and allowed to mortify.
“Ned Kelly”: “Yarrum” (B. 31/8/’22)
says that nearly all the old stone fences on the
Monaro (N.S.W.) have been replaced by posts and
wire, and asks where all the stones have gone to.
There are still thousands of the old fences standing,
especially round about Cooma ; and as to the where-
abouts of the stones, let “Yarrum” try, like I did,
to ride a bike through the grass anywhere near the
site of one of the old fences. He’il know.
* * * *
“Dixie”: Tell “C.L.N.” (B. 17/8/’22)
that my cattle have been eating prickly-pear for
four years—they won’t eat anything else while they
can get the pear. Still, I’ve had no losses in that
time, either from impaction or drought. While
my neighbors have had to shift their cattle on to
agistment country, I have continued milking all the
time, solely on prickly-pear. I have also been told
that pear will kill pigs. During dry stretches my
porkers get nothing else but boiled prickly-pear—
and they thrive on it.
* * *
“Bad Australian”: I have killed thousands
of wombats, and I want to say that “Bull’s Wool”
(B. 20/// 22) appears to have had a much wider
0f the animal that “ilerah” (B.
J [ scent” of an old man wombat
rivals that of a dyspeptic skunk or a garlic-fed
billy-goat. He is more or less mangy without and
wormy within, and the man who made a full meal
off his cadaver would deserve an iron cross jewelled
in every hole. In the bad old days, on the Pieman
Krver (Tas.), we used to vary a monotonous menu
by adding immature wombat; but anything beyond
the sucking stage was regarded as well over the
gastronomic odds, even in our state of perpetual crav-
ing for fresh meat. The fore part of the wombat
is covered with the usual kind of skin, but the
after part has a tough cartilaginous husk about the
thickness of sole leather, which, if placed upright
immediately after being taken off, will stand almost
as rigidly as the great wall of China. The skin
does not tan well, and it is no dam’ good when it is
tanned. lor hall door or motor give me a sheet
of stringy-bark, with the bull’s-wool uppermost, in
preference to the wombat’s pelt. It is easily re-
placed, looks healthier, and it doesn’t hum in
damp weather.

llie Ii.”: I’ve heard of cat’s eyes, cat’s
cradles and cat-calls; but cat’s eggs are new to
me; yet in W .A. they back pussies to lay eggs
against each other. At least that’s what I gather
from this advt., that appeared in the West Aus-
tkalian (Perth), just before the strike stopped any-
thing from appearing in it:—
Lost, Blue Persian Cat, from Laying Competition,
west Subiaco. Reward. Stubbing.
“Jimmy ’Possum”: They must have some
good roads where they carry a load of 22 tons on a
bullock-waggon (B. 10/8/’22). Something over 40
years ago my dad shifted a 15-ton flywheel from the
railway-station to the factory for the Ipswich (Q.)
Woollen Co. The waggon, with four-inch tyres,
ploughed up the streets, crashed through a box drain,
upset some underground piping which crossed the
street, and finally bogged down to the axle in the
metalled thoroughfare. Bananaland bullockies tm
the coast are glad to get along under ordinary con-
ditions with a load of from four to six tons.

“E. J.D.”: I have found snake-skins on
sand, and whole, and not reversed. This does not
agree with Le Souef, as quoted by “Six and Eight”
(B. 10/8/’22). I have also found skins in pieces,
and have seen the worms with (he tail skin half
on and half off. The skins are always nearly white,
though that of the black snake has a faint dark
tinge.

“Zanthus”: Some day, when Australians
take more interest in the past of their own country,
there will be a scientific overhaul of the caves at
Wellington (N.S.W.), which contain human remains
in deposits associated with those of crocodiles, the
Tasmanian tiger ( Thylacoleo ), the devil (Sarco-
philus) and other beasts long since extinct in those
parts. The Australian Museum would like to do it,
but money is scarce for this kind of thing. The
croc, belonged to an extinct species differing some-
what from that still found in the North. Long ago
W. Abbott brought to Sydney from beyond Nyngan
a number of crocodile , teeth found in the same

deposit as bones of the diprotodon. Maybe the

put forward the idea that the bunyip legend, where
it is a genuine blackfellow’s tradition, has been
handed down from the days when there were crocs,
in S'.-E. Australia.

'V hen poor old Dave the fencer died
A hundred miles from anywhere,

No priest arrived to offer prayer.

It surely cannot be denied.
They carried out his last behest —

stories approach perfection in the telling;
but he does not keep an even level—even-
ness was not part of a genius such as Law-
son’s. I have seen work written in his later
years which was wild and untamed, inco-
herent and even ungrammatical; but I
never can remember a piece of his verse or
prose which was worthless. Always there
was a point at which it approached distinc-
tion, always the sense of a very sincere and
earnest spirit struggling for expression gave
force to the whole. I do not think that
he ever wrote anything easily. It was by
the will, developed in one direction only, that
he forced himself to make his thought arti-
culate. Yet there was real melody in him,
and he sometimes rose to the height of a
splendid rhetoric.
It is far too early to attempt to pass any-
thing like a final judgment on the work of
a man who only yesterday walked our
streets and grasped our hands; but we can
be assured that the future will give him a
very high place. He sang and described the
Australia of his own day in a manner that
causes his writings to have the widest pos-
sible appeal. Ask the man toiling in the
Backblocks who is our greatest poet. There
is only one possible reply. Ask the same
question of critic, poet or journalist through-
out the Commonwealth, and the answer will
seldom vary. Different minds have seen
different phases of his work as admirable;
but he has stirred the emotions of all alike.
Too near to him to have things in their true
perspective, we can only dimly guess how
great he really is.
I risk the opinion that, it is by his verse
he will chiefly live. “Faces in the Street,”
published in 1888, has lost nothing in the
years. “The Star of Australasia,” which
appeared in 1895, has stir and movement of
a kind I have not met elsewhere ; and “One-
Ilundred-and-Three,” written in 1908, is in
every way a more honest indictment of the
prison system than “The Ballad of Reading
Gaol.” A T ou can pick holes in the verse to
any extent, give it names which aptly fit
it, and yet are wholly untrue, but the'fact
remains that it wears well. To say that the
dew is on Lawson’s lines would be ridicu-
lous; to say that they have the glare of sun,
the rush of wind and rain, the splash of
the mud and the grit of the flying dust is
nearer the truth.
The charge against Lawson that he painted
a gloomy Australia is not altogether un-
founded, though he has given us much of the
grim humor of real people in the quiet places
and sometimes produced a pure riot of fun.
I think the deafness that partly shut him
from the world tended to blot out from his
knowledge a good deal that was brightest
in the life about him. He distrusted all the
conventions because he conceived that they
had all treated him badly; yet lie has given
us dozens of little domestic pictures as sweet
and sunny and wholesome as any that have
been painted by other pens. He saw always
the best in the worst, and saw it in so
strong a light that he more than half-con-
vinced himself that the worst might be the
best under a thin disguise. His darker out-
look was intensified by the nature of his
own literary success. He worked on a very
wide canvas, but his method and treatment
had rather narrow limits imposed by his
slender technical equipment. His work sold
moderately well, but not well enough to make
his life-path easy; and he was continually
faced with the fact that a continent which
praised his work from shore to shore had
scarcely a home to offer him where he might
live free from want. Nobody exploited him;
all men wished him well. But he was not
fitted by nature to live as other men live;
and society has made no provision but the
praise of its lips for such as Henry. That he
judged the case of the whole community to
be very much like his own will account for
something rather oblique in his view of our
Australian life.
But Lawson was the first of Australia’s
sons to speak in her own tone and language.
That is his unique distinction. When the
little things of the moment are forgotten he
will stand out as the greatest man of his
age and country. Around his name will
grow from year to year a great love and
reverence. He belongs to a nation in the
building ; and who can even guess how much
of the foundation his wandering thought has
laid ?
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
Shakspeare, Dostoieffsky and
Frank Harris
A Red Page writer recently quoted Frank
Harris’s statement that Shakspeare and
Dostoieffsky, “alone of men, so far have
dared to enter or been able to describe” the
torture-chamber of Life. To understand
this coupling of two profoundly different,
and even antagonistic, minds, one has to
understand a little of Harris himself. Harris
has said lately that he is leaving Athens
for Jerusalem, but it is only his vanity that
makes him think he ever walked up the
Propylsea or stood in the Agora with Soc-
rates. An interesting character, a man of
intense physical energy, who has tasted most
of the experiences a small globe can offer,
extremely vain, with a magnetic personal
power, one who has always preferred to talk
rather than to write, and whose style, con-
sequently. is almost as casual as the spoken
word, Harris has always been spiritually
true to the land of his physical stock—
Judaea —to the basic emotion of the Jew,
Pity. Shaw’s quick eye detected in Harris
what he calls “the idiosyncratic appeal of
pity,” and as a complement to this, with a
psychological profundity not common in
Shaw, and which irritated Harris, an un-
scrupulous, not to say piratical, tendency.
Harris does not reveal very much of Shaks-
peare, but he exposes everything about him-
self. “The Man Shakspeare” should be
called “The Man Harris.” We get a por-
trait of a kind of de Musset, a febrile, de-
spairing minor poet, eternally soul-wrecked
(incidentally, writing two or three plays a
year), sensitive to the extent of morbidity,
and endowed with an excessive tenderness
over which Harris gloats horribly. With
genuine percention he sees that “Antony
and Cleopatra” is the central, the greatest
creation of the dramatist in the sensuous
reality of Cleopatra, and then proceeds to
attack him for his sensuality. So is the
emergence of' Athens in his consciousness
thrust into outer darkness by the dominance
of Jerusalem.
When Harris turns to Dostoieffsky he is
instantly at home. Here is an Eastern
mind with all the Eastern excesses of pity
and disgust. Harris who said profoundly
that Macbeth, as soon as the murder was
over, ceased to be a murderer and became
a poet, need fear no Attic sunlight here.
Raskolnikov will remain very much a morbid
murderer, and Sonia very much the senti-
mental harlot with none of the lasciviousness
of Cressida, none of the slight conscience-
less harlotry of Doll Tearsheet. Here are
■ all the cries of unapprehending pain, the
everlasting human voice of misery asking
“Why must we suffer?”....
But what has the Englishman’s poised and
powerful a mind to do with a primitive like
the Russian? Where Dostoieffsky creates
out of despair and pity, Shakspeare creates
out of overflowing vitality and exaltation.
He says, “Yea” to Life —to its lowest and
basest elements, to its noblest and most pas-
sionate, to hate and love, jealousy and terror.
He desires all these things; he loves them.
Joy desires not only itself; it desires woe
and despair; it desires, in Nietzsche’s phrase,
“the eternality of all things.” And Shaks-
peare, as surely as Beethoven, created out
of joy. All nihilistic values disappear before
him. “Lear” is not the same torture-cham-
ber as the “Brothers Karamasov” ; it is not
even the same torture-chamber as “Pfere
Goriot.” “Lear” is itself the triumph over
terror and pity and the human problem. It
carries through all its tempests an exalta-
tion that the terror of no lightiling, material
or mental, can destroy. Lear becomes trans-
figured with glory. Though human suffering
is, of course, the basis of the play, as of
the Russian novel, and Shakspeare must
have suffered more than Dostoieffsky, yet
the problem of suffering is approached from
an utterly different point of view. Shaks-
peare, out of his perfected humanity, takes
the fact in all its agony and pain, but adds
to it something triumphant, something that
defies pain. Acceptance of a condition is
fundamentally different from resignation to
a condition, or from that feeble form of re-
bellion that is only another facet of hope-
less resignation. Shakspeare accepts Life
for what he can make of it. Dostoieffsky
resigns himself to Life and cries like a ter-
rified child at this horrible but fascinating
thing to which he is chained and from which
lie cannot escape. One turns to the gods;
the other to the terror of earth.
Such, then, are the two minds Harris yokes
together. It is easily intelligible why he
finds the same elements in both ; for, to the
mind such as his that cannot react to exal-
tation, “Lear” and “Hamlet” are full of
pessimism, and “Antony and Cleopatra” is
the cry of a passion-blighted heart instead
of the ecstatic thing it is.
J. LINDSAY.
Marcus Andrew Hislop Clarke
What lias Fate in store for Marcus
Clarke’s magnum opus, admitting that “llis
Natural Life” is a great work? Will it
live? The readiest answer to this is that
it has lived. It first saw print in 1873, and
Victor Hugo’s “Les Mis4rables” is only 10
years older. Fifty years’ survival may be
accepted a-s some guarantee of immortality,
but is it true that “His Natural Life” is
vital still in the sense that Hugo’s equally
mannered, equally oppressive, but truly mag-
nificent novel is living and breathing to-
day? Is it not a fact that “His Natural
Life” keeps up a kind of circulation on
sufferance, even here in Australia, where we
are touched most nearly by its horrors?
The Germans who translated it, and the
Americans who adopted it, have long since
let it pass, I imagine after a vain effort
to discover it manifesting any signs of life
in either country. True it is that in xVus-
tralia the book continues to appear, and to
make its way into private libraries and into
the hands of young people just beginning to
read, who fondly imagine it to be a duty
they owe to the State to have first-hand
acquaintance with the great Australian novel
—still in the minds or many the only Aus-
tralian novel. But it is not a book to in-
spire liking. It is-a nasty book, not in the
sense in which the word is applied to por-
nographic novels, but because it deals so
precisely, so relentlessly, with cruelty, hate,
abnormal vice and criminality. It is a work
of original genius, but there is always a
suspicion of untruth groping in its chap-
ters, always a sense of overstrain, a feeling
that if the case is not over-stated, it is over-
emphasised and wanting in artistic appre-
ciation of the value of light and shade. The
thing is more a diatribe than a novel. It
not merely touches you, but goads you into
running for cover to some cave where you
can blind your eyes while stopping your
ears.
No novel ever written gives so erroneous
an idea of its author as does “His Natural
Life.” Clarke was naturally a cheerful
raconteur, a persifleur, a flaneur, a bright
and caustic mind, one whose heart and art
were much more in his “Peripatetic Philo-
sopher,” ground out weekly for the Austra-
lasian, and his “Buncle Papers,” “Philo-
sophical Essays” and “Old Tales of a
Young Country,” to mention only a few
evidences of his extraordinary journalistic
productivity, than in anything he attempted
in the way of a novel. In fact, where the
young Englishman succeeded admirably as
an Australian short-story writer and a
writer of breezy sketches and shrewd, sharp
essays, his attempts at larger fiction, apart
from the one big book by which he is remem-
bered, were dismal failures. “Heavy Odds”
is a poor enough thing, so poor that it is
difficult to imagine Clarke sinking his sin-
gular talent to such commonplace. It was
published in his own periodical, too, the
foolishly-titled Colonial Monthly, in which
he enjoyed a free hand. There were illus-
trations by Tom Carrington, which look
quaintly archaic to the present-day seeker.
“The Mystery of Major Molineux” deserves
the obscurity into which it has fallen, sunken
in the dust-covered pages of a defunct subur-
ban paper. I.n “Four Stories High” he en-
deavors to convert several not very well con-
nected stories into a harmonious whole with
strings of desultory conversation ; and does
not succeed very well, although the individual
stories are good. As a youngster he had writ-
ten “The Apothecary of Mantua,” and, dying,
he added a few chapters to “Felix and Feli-
citas,” a novel with which he hoped to
sweeten the mouths of his readers after a
surfeit of “His Natural Life.” Of his first
and his last books I can find no more than
is set forth here; but of short stories,
sketches of bush life, essays, adventure in
public controversy and verses there is a
bibliography as long as my arm. Here is a
congenial field of research, for Clarke’s prose
journalism is eminently readable and his
verse is piquant and clever. He would have
been an admirable Bulletin contributor. In
fact, he stands out as the one man of the
three significant writers of his time (the
other two are Kendall and Gordon) who
would have made a financial success in jour-
nalism to-day. You may think what you
like of the conclusions drawn in the preface
to Gordon’s poems and the little-known “The
Future Australian Race,” but you cannot
deny that they are excellent essays and make
delightful reading.
Hamilton Mackinnon, acting as Clarke’s
literary executor, produced some 30 years
ago a book of “Australian Tales,” which,
though really more a book of essays and
sketches, gives a fair of the light side
of the author. It is an inelegant volume,
bound in bilious pasteboard, and disfigured
with pages of ill-setr advertisements of stays,
whiskies and cough medicines; but it was
cheap at the shilling or so I gave for it. It
was marked “Vol. 1.” Volumes 2 and 3
were foreshadowed under the titles, “Sensa-
tional Stories” and “Humor in Verse and
l’rose,” but never went to press, I imagine.
Much of Clarke’s stuff is youthful
work. He was only 35 when he
died, and but a little over 17 when
he came to Australia, the protggA of
Judge Clarke, of Melbourne County Court.
The Clarke family was well represented in
Australia: another uncle was his Excellency
Andrew Clarke, Governor of Westralia, who
was buried in Perth in-1849. Captain Clarke,
Victoria’s first Surveyor-General, but better
deserving of fame as the first of its grand
army of State pensioners, was a cousin to
our author. On arriving in Melbourne, a
thoroughly sophisticated youth, in fact, a
spoiled boy, with several hundreds of pounds
in his pocket, the first thought of our Marcus
Superbus was to paint that city a rich ver-
milion ; and he put the paint on so thick that
the painters’ bills presently quite absorbed
bis inheritance. The youthful Marcus had
been admirably schooled for this sort of
thing. Since childhood he had associated in
his father’s house with a band of loose-
living, loose-thinking, loose-drinking and
loose-talking Bohemians of both sexes. At
17, when his foolish father died and the
mystery of the source of his income passed
with him, Marcus Clarke was quite familiar
with the liberal arts, wine, women and dice ;
and from the careless disregard for money so
early implanted in him he reaped many a fat
harvest of trouble in his after life.
Having done in his cheque in the not-too-
gilded halls, Marcus turned to Uncle James,
the County Court Judge; and Uncle James
used his influence to get the lad a job in the
Bank of Australasia. Fate played a mad
prank on a staid financial institution when it
loosed Marcus Clarke on the bank’s ledgers;
it played as mean a trick upon Clarke. But
the boy did not let figures madden him as
Kendall did later, or as Victor Daley did
later still. He had a method of his own
for computing long columns of numerals. He
looked them up and down with a discrimi-
nating eye and guessed the totals. After-
wards he congratulated himself on the fact
that although his summary method was
never correct, he always came near ithe
truth. It was not near enough for the bank,
however; and the manager was reluctantly
compelled to advise young Clarke that pos-
sibly he had a talent for agriculture or the
practice of stone-breaking, where mathemati-
cal precision was not called for. Uncle
James next placed his protegd on a station
near Glenorchy, the Bullock Town of so many
of Clarke’s subsequent tales and sketches,
Clarke seems to have enjoyed the bucolic
life. At any rate, he took it extremely easily,
with a book of verse beneath the bough for
the main part. Not till he had imbued the
station-hgnds with a. thirst for literature
that interfered sadly with the attention that
should have been bestowed on jutmbucks
and the needful care of fences was Clarke
again advised to try his undoubted but pecu-
liar talents in some other department of life.
Meanwhile, however, Marcus had met with
the learned Dr. Robert Dewins, his good
angel, well remembered in a large, assorted
company of evil geniuses, Dewins sampled
young Marcus’s output, for he had written
much, and was fired with enthusiasm. He
recommended the literary life, introduced the
aspiring youth to the Argus people, and set
him afloat. Marcus suffered'“the lot austere,”
but its austerity was wholly of his owh mak-
ing. His madcap upbringing had made of
him a mere monkey with money. When he
had none it was a commodity to be secured
at any sacrifice; when he had it it was an
encumbrance to rid oneself of wil hout \
moment’s delay. No need that was not immi-
nent and urgent was worthy of the smallest
consideration. He could eat, drink and be
merry knowing that to-morrow did not exist
and with a fixed notion that it would never
come. Clarke did heaps of work and found
ready sale for it. What rates he received
his biographers have unfortunately not put on
record: but we know from the man’s spend-
ings, if not from his savings, that, they were
not niggardly. He worked for the Akgus
and the Australasian, for the Queens-
lander and for the London Daily Tele-
graph. Later his work appeared in the
Herald, the Age, the Leader, the Colonial
Monthly Humbug, the Australian Jour-
nal, Punch and many other papers. He
was ready to turn a nimble quill in any
department; and was Melbourne represen-
tative for several country papers. He wrote
plays, pantomimes and burlesques. Pompous
but kindly liedmond Barry found a post for
him in the Melbourne Public Library; but
he shocked the conventions by attacking
bishops and other dignitaries in the
Monthly and in Humbug, and could not hold
his job. He married and left his wife—who
had been Marian Dunn, daughter of John
Dunn, a prominent comedian of the time
(1869) —at the church door to go off and
hunt for a roof to put over her. It was this
marriage which turned his thoughts to the
stage. 11 is dramatic works were numerous,
including a dramatisation of “Foul Play”;
a. burlesque, “Goody Two Shoes”; a
drama, “Plot”; a pantomime, “Twinkle
Little Star”; "Alfred the Great,” a
burlesque; “Moonstone,” another drama;
“Baby’s Luck.” a small comedy: an
extravaganza, “King of the Genii,” and two
comedies for his wife, “A Daughter of Eve”
and “Forbidden Fruit.” Before Oscar Wilde
Clarke dealt with the “Salome” theme; he
turned the Molifere comedy, “Le Bourgeois
Gentilhomme,” into good English for Dunn,
under the title of “Peacock’s Feathers.”
Among his papers were considerable por-
tions of four other plays; “Queen Venus,” a
light opera; “Reverses,” a comedy of Aus-
tralian life; “Paul and Virginia,” a bur-
lesque ; and “Fridoline,” a comic opera:
and there was “His Natural Life,” practi-
cal ly the one thing by which he is not
wholly forgotten, a monument of industry,
the material for which was assembled dur-
ing a holiday to Hobart, taken for health’s
sake. Many of Clarke’s dramatic pieces
were successful money-makers; yet the
author was always impecunious, excepting
for odd hours at a time when he drew his
earnings, or laid eager hands on a loan
negotiated with an utter disregard for con-
sequences at a rate of hundreds per cent.
He was twice in the Bankruptcy Court, the
last, time being hustled through by Aaron
Waxman, a name long conspicuous in usury,
at a moment when the litterateur’s health
was shattered and death was at hand. He
died August 2, 1881, still practically a youth.
“With a new liver I’d be another man,” he
told Dr. Pat Moloney the day before his
death.
The bulk of the matter Marcus Clarke
bequeathed to young Australia is still emi-
nently readable ; and we should be ashamed
to recollect him only by his great, grim
novel. Booksful of his gay good human
stuff are now almost entirely neglected.
Thousands of discriminating readers in this
country are eagerly purchasing little 6s.
volumes of belles-lettres b-V English and
foreign authors, who are content to ignore
the more readable work of a better man who
was one of themselves. But I fondly believe
Marcus Clarke will be beloved of future
generations, filled with love of Australia
and the desire to know what one of her
earliest, best writers had to say of her.

“Sucre”: Queensland has the longest circulating
library in the world —the “Bush Book Club.” Old
books, periodicals, magazines, etc., are sent by the
organisation to Dirranbandi on the South, Charle-
ville on the South-Western, and Emmet on the
Central-Western lines, and at the present time, as
a result of the system, over 1500 volumes are in
the hands of lonely selectors.
“Thor”: A queer medley is Sir Harry Johnston, the
African ex-administrator who has taken to completing
the yarns and plays of Dickens and Shaw.
He is a short, stout man, with an effeminate squeak
and the mildly apologetic air of a suburban draper’s
assistant. Nothing less like the Empire-builder of
fiction could be imagined. Though very English
and squirearchical in his outlook, Johnston is always
found with men like Gilbert Murray, barracking for
the downtrodden races in League of Nations meetings
and similar gatherings.
“Jacky Roo” (London) : “The Sentimental Bloke,”
by C. J. Dennis, and “Columbine,” by Hugh McCrae,
are selling well here. I hunted all over London
before I could buy a copy of the “Bloke.” Book-
sellers are awaiting the arrival of another edition
from Australia. The only place where I could find
“Columbine” was at the hospitable offices of the
British Australasiah. They tell me there that
there is a great demand for Aussie books, but that
nnonle grumble at the high prices on the cover
leaves.

“The Rumpus” : Westralia is showing its
nose above the sand, despite all the alleged
Federal handicaps. In a small suburban
area west df Perth, the following industries
are going: Concrete pipes, ink, asbestos
sheeting, stoves and castings, porcelain and
pottery, cast-iron pipes, and glass. If
Westralians would only have faith in their
own country, the Eastern dump on their
markets would soon be a thing of the past.
“Huffin-Guffin": Surely “Yarrum” (B.

by local fingers. When I was a small
boy I saw an old grandmother comb wool
from the family sheep’s backs, spin it into
worsted on her old spinning-wheel, and knit
socks for the boys. That was in 1877. Place,

“Hecagus”: Recently in N.Q., I bought
a “Made in Japan” lead pencil—no other
brand being procurable—and accidentally
wet it. It promptly fell apart, disclosing a
piece of lead about an inch long, in either
end. The wood was not even grooved to
hold more lead. A toothbrush purchased
about the same time, also bearing Japan’s
brand, lasted two weeks. I am not an advo-
cate for German-made goods, but I think
even the worst of their imports are superior
to the best of the rubbish imported from
Asia.
“X2X”: A few miles from Mackay, North
Queensland, are to be seen growing several
fine specimens of the cascara-tree (Rhamnus
pursianus ), from which the medicinal cas-
cara is obtained, the bark of the tree being
the part used. The variety seems to flourish
in that climate, and samples of the bark
have been shown by analysis to possess all
the properties demanded by both British and
United States Pharmacopoeias. In addition
there is a higher content of the characteris-
tic alkaloids than in the American variety,
from.which the bulk of the cascara of com-
merce and medicine is procured. Australia
annually imports thousands of pounds’
worth of this drug.

his head. He carefully folded each paper
singly, then started off at a trot down the
street crying: “’Ere y’ar’! Strike ended!”
He sold like hot cakes, running all the time
and giving- no change for silver tendered.
He had to keep running.

“Pat Bushie”: Re “Yardley’s” par. on
quick-erection houses. Workmen’s hornet
at Broken Hill, generally speaking, are built
very quickly. The frame is of wood, on to
which the outer walls—galvanised .iron—-are
nailed. The inner walls are of hessian, cov-
ered with wallpaper. These places are run
up on mining tenements, held under miner’s
rights, at ss. p.a., and when the tenant de-
sires to change his address the home is
divided into sections and shifted. It is a
common sight to see a house, stacked on a
lorry, in transit.

“Lexite” : The American “Literary Digest”
is taking what looks like the largest unoffi-
cial poll ever gathered—lo,ooo,ooo ballot-
cards have been distributed by post—to
ascertain the sentiments of the American
people on the beer question. Up to the
tune when 207,000 votes had been counted,
only 34 per cent, of the voters were in favor
of the strict enforcement of the “dry” laws;
but, on the other hand, only 23 per cent,
want them repealed. The bulk of the voters
are opposed both to saloons and to bone-
drouth, and in favor of an amendment
allowing light wines and beer to be sold.
“Warrawong”: “Kirk” (B. 24/8/’22) is
astray in his estimate of the bearing age of
walnut-trees. At 10 years they will bear
fairly well; two years later they should be
producing heavy crops, if they have been
grafted. In California, in order to secure a
maximum return,. peaches and apricots are
planted as fillers-in between the young wal-
nuts to utilise the 40ft. space between the
trees. Then, at eight or nine years, the
filler-trees are removed and the walnuts are
allowed to grow unchecked.

“U.P.” : Holden’s, Limited, now extending
their Adelaide premises, already have the
largest motor body-building factory in the
British Empire. The firm only commenced
business in an experimental way in 1917,
but now em P lc, y 750 hands, and turn
out 200 motor bodies a week —when the addi-
tions are finished 250 bodies will be com-
pleted weekly. The founder of the company
is H. J. Holden, whose business career was
for many years solely associated with Holden
and Frost, saddlers, of Grenfell-street.
Il.J.’s chief hobbies outside of business have
been the Y.M.C.A., Baptist Church and the
Norwood Council. His eldest son is now
taking the reins at the works; and a younger
one has recently returned from a trip to
America, where he was sent to find out thb
best the Yanks know in body-building.
has brought back a number of ideas which,
with, the new machines on the way, will
enable the Adelaide firm to manufacture as
speedily and efficipnflv as they do in tlm
thirsty country.

To Avoid Sickness.
To avoid and to overcome sickness of all
kinds, watch your bowels. Don’t allow old
fermenting food to stay in them for days,
but get it out.
If your stomach is disordered, or your
bowels constipated, if you feel sluggish,
dizzy or bilious, get a box of Chamberlain’s
Tablets at once.
They act directly upon the liver, regulate
the bowels, invigorate the stomach, cleanse
the system. The result is a relish for food,
increased strength and a clear head.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are good for con-
stipation, sour stomach and gases on the
stomach. A single dose often relieves these
troubles.
The use of these Tablets is not followed by
constipation as is the case with many laxatives.
Instead of weakening the bowels they strength-
en them to act naturally without assistance.
Chronic constipation may be permanently
relieved by Chamberlain’s Tablets. They
have none of the sickening qualities of pills,
and do not produce an unpleasant effect.
Keep Your Bowels Clean.
That listless, tired, drowsy feeling may be
due to poisonous matter lodged in the bowels.
Many folks who always feel tired and only
“half alive” will be surprised how much
better they will feel when they get rid of ihis
matter which has been poisoning their system
for days.
Nervousness, sleeplessness and some kinds
of headaches are frequently signs of poison-
ing of the system through poisons left in the
bowels.
Irritation of the bladder, breathlessness,
so-called weak and fluttering heart, are often
caused by pressure of gas in the intestines—
this gas may originate from decaying food in
the system.
A man is seldom sick when his bowels are
regular, and never well when they are
irregular. Bear this in mind and take
Chamberlain’s Tablets as occasion may
require. There is nothing better. They
are i *ld and gentle in their action and
pleasu to take.
Old Age.
Old age as it comes in the orderly process
of nature is a beautiful and majestic thing.
It stands for experience, knowledge, wisdom,
counsel. That is old age as it should be,
but old age as it often is means poor digestion,
torpid bowels, a sluggish liver and a general
feeling of ill health, despondency and misery.
This in almost every instance is wholly
unnecessary. One of Chamberlain’s Tablets
taken immediately after supper will improve
the digestion, tone up the liver and regulate
the bowels. That feeling of despondency
will give way to one of hope and good cheer.

Protect Yourself.
B T getting a bottle of this wonderful
medicine to-day. You can rely on it
to prevent much suffering in your family.
There is no surer protection from
Coughs, Colds, Croup or Influenza than
CHAMBERLAIN’S
COUGH REMEDY
Children’s Ailments.
Children, like adults, are subject to
disorders of the stomach, liver and bowels,
and many of the apparently alarming ailments
of childhood are due to these causes.
Constipation is a common trouble among
children and is often the cause of seeming
stupidity at lessons and also of many an
exhibition of temper.
Chamberlain’s Tablets are invaluable for
children. They are pleasant and safe to take
and absolutely without harsh effect.
Half a Tablet is sufficient for children from
six to twelve; for children under six, one-third
of a Ta.blet will have the desired effect.
If your child is bilious, if its appetite is
poor and variable, if it is fretful and
nattering, restless in its sleep, you may be
sure that its stomach is out of order and a
few doses of Chamberlain’s Tablets will
quickly set it right.
Some Causes of Profit and Loss
The manner in which the machinery of a factory is run to a great extent
controls the profits. If power is lost through the use of old-fashioned plain
bearings the profits will naturally not show as favorably as they might.
That is why every works-manager should inquire into
BALL BEARINGS.
Let him ask any business associate who has had experience with SKF. He
will be told of lubrication bills that are trifles, of production that, with the
same facilities, is larger than it "ever was, of overhead expenses that are down
to a minimum, and of a total absence of profit-losing breakdowns due to
faulty bearings.
He will also learn of tremendous horse-power saved, of friction eliminated, of
the necessity of inspection and lubrication only three or four times a year, of
how the ball bearings look after themselves—even in the case of shaft
deflection SKF Ball Bearings, being self-aligning, adjust themselves.

“Ash'mead”: Bank managers strike knotty
situations sometimes. Near Launceston not
long ago was a cocky who had had a rough
spin, what with droughts, fires, sickness in
the house and so on. He had a bank account
which approached a fiver, and a farm worth
a few hundred quid. Anxious to give it an-
other fly, he came to town and put it on the
manager of his bank for an overdraft of two-
fifty. The great man was acquainted with
the circumstances, and had to answer that
the request could not be entertained. Then
Cocky played his trump card. “I’ll make it
worth a fiver,” he whispered, “if you can
manage it.”
Mintaro (S.A.) saw a fine bit of good fel-
lowship lately. A resident had a contract
for metalling a few chains of toad, but lost
the sight of one eye While stOne-breaking
on the job. After he had been removed tb
hospital, about 17 neighbors stepped in with
horses, drays and all other necessary mat-
erial, and in two strenuous days had the con-
tract completed for him.
On an actress, <jead at 85
Ih Genevieve Ward’s case a comparatively little
dramatic triumph was made to go a long way. The
romantic story of her youthful marriage, and the sub-
sequent blighting of her operatic career by an attack
of diphtheria, served as fine advertisement for the
remarkable-looking lady after she took to the
dramatic stage, and seemingly she always had the
necessary financial means to carry her into notoriety
when the chance offered. It came with a melodrama
called “Forget-me-not,” boomed in America in 1881,
before she brought it to England. After a good
season in London the energetic lady, who was already
verging on the fifties, took her lucky purchase round
the world with her own company, and made a lot of
money. The name-character in “Forget-me-not”
was an adventuress, of Italian birth and uncertain
age, who fascinated all men with her beauty. Played
nowadays it would have no chance, but a powerful
modern melodrama was a rarity 40 years ago, and
Genevieve Ward was an impressive personality with
an ingrained talent for getting talked about. The
tradition of her Australian success survives, and the
Melbourne Women’s Hospital has a Genevieve Ward
wing in commemoration of her Town Hall perform-
ances of a Greek tragedy in aid of the good cause.
She raised £2BOO thereby. All the same, Genevieve
was neither “great” nor versatile. Her celebrity as
an actress was confined to the one part, which a
younger woman could have played more effectively,
j remember her “Forget-me-not” at the original
Melbourne Princess’s; Art elderly English actor
nfimed Vernon was leading man, and the lady looked
older than he, I thought. Perhaps t was rather
prejudiced, for as a growing youth I had seen her
make her first London appearance at the Addphi in
“The Sea of Ice,” where, by an Old and simple con-
trivance, the whole stage was converted itito the
least unnatural-looking waste of waters I ever saw
in melodrama. Genevieve at that time had but
lately arrived in England. In my young eyes she was
amateurish, and, in a short skirt, looked very stiff
about the legs, while her face looked no younger than
her underpins. I suppose she was risking some
money in the show. A woman of indomitable pluck
and ambition was Genevieve Ward. A much-travelled
artist in her young operatic days, a linguist, a
studied elocutionist and a Personage. Above all, an
American. Born in New York, she was a grand-
daughter of Gideon Lee, one of the Early Fathers
of the city, but she may have been almost as Spanish
as she looked on one side of her parentage. Her
childhood and youth had been passed in Italy, and
her story of love’s young dream was that it hap-
pened in Milan when she was 17. Count Constan-
tine Guerbel, a Russian officer, was the gay deceiver.
They had a civil marriage at Nice, on the under-
standing that it should be solemnised in Paris on
Greek Church lines. But it was Lent when they got
to Paris, and the Count managed to clear out. He
had tricked the damsel. Then Miss Ward and mother
went to St. Petersburg, stayed with their cousin,
General Seymour, the American Minister, were intro-
duced by him to Count Orloff, who presented them
to the Czar, who ordered Count Guerbel tQ. return
from Italy (where he was then about to marry the
daughter of the Russian Ambassador), and compelled
him to “make an honest woman” of the girl. Miss
Ward was married in a black silk dress at Warsaw
Cathedral, and after the ceremony she saw no more
of her Russian husband.
“Yardley”: A company is being formed to
work a formation of lithographic stone just
discovered upon an island off the coast of
Western Australia. Since the stone retails
up to 4d. a pound, rosy pictures are sug-
gested of a dip into the £600,000 a year
which normally pours into Bavaria. The
trade, however, has a unique aspect which
may shock sanguine shareholders. A min-
ing friend of mine once related to me his
experiences in London, when seeking market
for lithographic-stone from Maoriland. dur-
ing the early ’seventies. Leading lithog-
raphers reported the stone as equal to the
best which ever came out of Germany. But
its very cheapness proved to be its undoing.
A single firm of lithographers held stocks of
stone which had cost £70,000 ;it w r as obvious
that a cheaper supply would seriously be-
little their assets. Hence they so crabbed
the M.L. show that my friend became first
disheartened, then hopeless, and eventually
chucked the enterprise.
The Mitchell Library is now in possession
of the Flinders papers, offered by Professor
Flinders P a trie to any Australian State
erecting a monument to the navigator’s
memory. The collection includes the original
log of the Investigator, a private diary and
official and private letters. The collection
is regarded as one of the most valuable that
the Library has yet received.
A BIT TOO FAR.

He found her at the cinema j she knew not whence
he came,
Nor had she met him ere that night. She did not
ask his name,
There in the dark, so dose to her, he sat through-
out the show,
That she was all a-tingle with a warm, responsive
glow.
He clung to her as she Went home; in vain did she
protest;
He came into her Very room, and stayed while
she undressed;
But here she caught and slew him, heedless of sweet
pity’s plea,
“Since half-past eight to-night,” she said, “I’ve had
that wretched flea!”

“Thor”: Beauty that helps at the start
usually handicaps in the straight, but
Gladys Cooper has just confounded her
critics by demonstrating that she can run
a good second to Mrs. Pat Campbell as
Paula Tanqueray. Since she quitted Gaiety-
girlism for high comedy, it has been the
convention to patronise Gladys by advising
her to study, take her art more seriously,
not to rely too much on her natural graces
and so forth. But everyone who knows
mumming from the inside realised that she
was playing right up to the level of the
parts coming her way.
“R.D.” (B. 31/8/’22) is wrong
regarding the genesis of the fine opera-house
in Kingsway, near Australia House, and
wrong in stating that Viscount Astor “tried
to establish grand opera on a lavish scale,
and came a cropper.” He is mixing him up
with the late Oscar Hammerstein, the
American entrepreneur, who built the Lon-
don Opera House at a cost of £lOO,OOO,
decorating it superbly, but failed to make
grand opera boom. There were two reasons
for the non-success of the venture. First of
all, the building was out of the beat of
opera-goers ; and, secondly, London hadn’t the
musical enthusism to support two opera
houses. Poor Oscar never got. over his
Kingsway failure. In 1913 I saw the
American revue, “Come Over Here,” played
there: since then it has been turned into a
picture palace, and pays rates and taxes,
and a little over.
“Ashmead” : I know of a pair of twin girls
who are amazingly similar in appearance.
A chap proposed to Doris, but she knocked
him back, so he went to the war to end his
misery. However, his luck was still out, and
he returned. Back he went to the scene of
his previous rejection, and proposed again.
To his surprise and delight he was accepted.
He couldn’t fathom why he should have
been rejected before, and asked for an ex-
planation. “Oh, I’m Alma,” she said. “It
was Doris you asked before!” I take it
the ardent lover was satisfied, for I saw a
birth-advt. in the paper the other day, which
ran: “God’s greatest gift—a girl.”
“Yardley”: As evidence of what ocean cur-
rents will do, I have known the watch-below
wake up with the cold when crossing out
of the Gulf Stream. The change is almost
as swift as would be the passing out of sun-
shine into a refrigerator. Shipmasters have
navigated from America to England by
means of a thermometer. We in Australia
are remarkably remiss in studying this branch
of meteorology. At some future day, when
specially-equipped cruising vessels “wireless”
every variation of ocean currents of the
south, our successors will wonder how we ever
ignored this valuable source of information
about coming weather changes. Explanation
of alleged cycles of climate may lie in the
fact that the ice masses of the Polar regions
accumulate until their weight breaks them
from the main pack. Then, of course, the
’bergs, floating north, extend the cool zone.
Surely the agricultural and pastoral interests
of this continent are worth the cost of one
or two cruising vessels employed in picking
up pointers in the Antarctic.
“Rio” : The following is from Robertson’s
“From Private to Field Marshal (p. 166) :
King Edward paid his usual annual visit to Aider-
shot .... As he did not ride, and as it was necessary
that he should see as many of the troops as possible-
troops had to be brought near to places where his
motor could be taken....
And Sydney’s memorial shows Edward the
Peacemaker as a field-marshal, baton in
hand, astride a prancing charger.
“Nella”: Touching the proposed produc-
tion of “The Beggar’s Opera” by J. C. Wil-
liamson. The “Newgate Pastoral,” as Swift
called it, was the greatest success the Lon-
don stage had ever seen (1728), and it made
the fortune of many connected with it, pos-
sibly because the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Dr. Herring, pronounced it immoral. It put
a large sum in the pocket of Gay, the poet,
and made Rich, the manager, as opulent as
his name. Lavinia Fenton was the original
Polly, and made such a hit that Rich raised
her salary from 15s, a week to 30s. She caught
the eye of the Duke of Bolton, who made
her his duchess. Thomas Walker was the
Captain Macheath. His success tvas fatal
to him, for the chronicles tell “he followed
Bacchus too ardently,” and so he died. “The
Beggar’s Opera” was produced here, circa
1869, I think for the first time, with Mrs.
Guerin as Polly, and Richard Stewart as
Macheath. These performers were the
parents of our own Nellie Stewart.
The Australian Historical Society, has
secured what is claimed to be the first
Commonwealth flag flown in Australia. It
comes from Townsville, where, in 1901,
G.-G. Hopetoun announced that a Common-
wealth flag had been decided upon. Mr.
Wm. McKenzie, of Townsville, immediately
had one made. It was run up before the
G.-G. left.
THE PICTURED AND THE REAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Three photographs are on my wall, two profiles and
another,
Which turns a full face very sweet each morning
unto me.
With a deep and true affection, neither time nor
chance can smother,
I am worshipping this three in one, this charming
trinity.
That she is just an actress, many visitors have told
me,
But I only see her beauty and the soul behind those
eyes.
The wonder of their loveliness for evermore will
hold me.
And I longed to meet a woman who was beautiful
and wise.
Then came that painted creature. First, I met her
on the station,
With red lips fairly melting in the ardor of the
sun,
And with eyes so black they seemed to me a curious
imitation
Of bruises loving costers give their mistresses
in fun.
I meet her on the trams, too, and her sheep’s eyes
irritate me.
I ignore their invitation with discreetly-muttered
damns,
How, alas ! am I divided, where I love I’m hating
greatly,
For the lady of the pictures is the woman of the
tram*.

In the drama now at Melbourne Royal
is the charm of oddity for such as can
appreciate it. The hero has no copybook
virtue whatever. AVhen one of his early
fleeting loves turns up in the last scene to
appeal to him, before upbraiding him, and
then leaves him staggered by the news that
he has a son who inherited his father’s voice,
the pleasing philanderer obeys the one
natural instinct of unselfishness that ever-
happened him. Downhearted for the next
five minutes, he gaily responds to the tele-
phone bell which calls him to take a new
sweetheart to their first luncheon. Curtain.
“The Great Dover” offers a thoughtful,
humorously-cynical study of operatic artist
character, and Louis Bennison presents a
subtle interpretation of the name part. His
Jean Paurel is always an artist, never more
truly temperamental than when, stricken
with sudden loss of warble, he hears the
voice of his understudy making good. He
rises to a strong melodramatic situation in
an unstagey way. Throughout the play
Bennison identifies himself with his imper-
sonation. He never obviously acts the
actor, and in his freedom from conventional
theatricalism the artist shines. The sup-
port is weakest where strength is most
essential. Marjorie Bennett, unbecom-
ingly dressed for the most part, maintains
her accustomed ingenue style under unsuit-
able circumstances, whilst Lou Vernon fails
to look the ingenuous boy baritone. Among
a host of others a lady with the confusing-
name of Beverley Sitgreaves gives a lively
picture of an irate, vulgar prima donna.
Leslie Victor walks easily through the part
of a surgeon who pronounces the case of
Bennison’s throat to be hopeless, and John
Bedouin plays the valet as though he were
Fred Cambourne. Three scenes by George
Upward are carefully done, likewise the
stage management, but voices singing behind
the scenes would undoubtedly have paid for
being more expensive. The effect of those
voices is not good enough.
* * * *
Further consideration of “The Lie,” at
Melbourne King’s, confirms a first impres-
sion that Emelie Polini, in her capacity of
artless spinster, wrongly suspected as re-
gards a bull-necked kiddie, fails to natural-
ise the situation. The part of Elinor Shale
misfits her. Alleged to be the daughter of
an English baronet, whose ancestors have
been drinking hard for 600 years, she is, as
it were, out of the Old Abbey picture. Char-
acteristics that make her an effective actress
in very different parts are a handicap to
her in this case, and together with an im-
probable butler (Maurice Dudley) and an
unnatural dressmaker (Eily Malyon) she
gives the domestic drama an unfavorable
send-off. Her share of the dialogue with a
cold and cautious suitor at the outset is
the weakest work Miss Polini has ever done,
whereas, all that Marie Ney does is her best
effort in modern comedy up to date. A
change of cold and cautious suitors has not
improved the performance. Greenaway, who
formerly appeared at short notice as the
victim of Marie’s unblushing fib, was the
clean-cut type of high-toned engineer who
might be expected to nurse his gullibility
instead of making further inquiries, but
Claude Flemming, who afterwards took over
the part he was engaged for, is a sanguine
sort of person who hardly meets require-
ments. All the same, “The Lie” had a
crowded house on its second Saturday night.
* * * *
“The Merry Widow” promises to be a
profitable revival at Melbourne Majesty’s
for just as long as the Firm can spare the
time. With Gladys Moncrieff and Howett-
Worster as principals the tuneful opera has
taken on a new life, the concerted number
near the end of the second act being a more
refined burst of song than in previous pro-
ductions. Since the first night confidence
has come to the aid of Herbert Browne’s
pretty tenor voice. On the other hand the
tameness of Rene Maxwell in all respects
would demand severe comment if her im-
proved appearance didn’t nip reproof in the
bud.
** * *
At Melb. Tivoli the tall but unassuming
personality of Lee White will retire on Fri-
day. On Saturday comes Ethel Hook (sister
of Clara Butt) with a baritone and a pian-
ist, also Gene Gerard, whilst several other
matters remain as at present.
* *
D’Alvarez, back at Melbourne Town Hall
for four nights, will have the concert market
pretty well to herself. Her season ranges
from Saturday, 16th, to Saturday following.
** * *
“Broken Blossoms,” running at Hovt’s De
Luxe, Melbourne, this week, is D. W. Grif-
fith’s version of “The Chink and the Child,”
which figures in Thomas Burke’s “Limehouse
Nights.” The film is good enough as Ameri-
can films go. but it is impossible to trans-
late into celluloid the craft that gave the
original story an extraordinary beauty. At
Hoyt’s Lyceum the popular vote is heavily
m favor of “The Scrapper,” an Hibernian
strike-breaker with the power of a steam-
hammer in his dirty left. The Majestic is
relying for laughs on Mabel Normand in
What Happened to Rosa,” a serio-comic
production which provides the lady noth a
bath in Pussyfoot Johnson’s favorite fluid.
“The Invisible Fear.” at the Britannia, is
less important than the dress goods of Anita
Stewart. The pretty little lady had made
JO changes of raiment when this writer
gave up counting. At the Melba, Anna O.
Nilsson, in “The Man from Home,” is again
causing strife with her fatal beauty.
* * * m
A Melbourne note :
A. E. Newbury makes a great spread of eanyas at
the Fine Art Society, but the general effect is
lowered by the inclusion of sundry small studies
painted in a listless, average manner. Stuff of the
quality of “The White Cloud” (No. 7) and “The
Beach, Cowes” (No. 68) is readily knocked off by
the breakneck potboiler, but it is unworthy of one
of Newbury’s reputation. His best work is shown
in “A Spring Morning.” There is a sharper brilli-
ancy of contrast between the light and shade of
Sunshine and Shadow,” and the balance of emphasis
is in favor of the trees at the expense of the rest of
the picture; but it is a pleasing performance never-
theless. Newbury’s largest subject, “Lengthening
Shadows,” in which the trees are sombre, and the
kine appear to be engulfed in the composition is
somewhat heavy. On the other hand, “The Village
Through the Trees” is excellent, and so are his

Oscar Asche’s “Cairo” will stab the sky
with its minarets at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
on Saturday night, and dazzle the eye with
the gorgeous Oriental panorama which made
blasg London gasp with delight. The pro-
duction is on such a stupendous scale that
nest week will see the dictionaries dredged
for superlatives in many a newspaper office.
How much space it will require to do justice
to “Cairo” is still a problem.

The more Laurence Grossmith is studied
as Ambrose Applejohn at Sydney Criterion
the more admirable he appears. His articu-
lation is perfect; he has a polished ease of
manner which recalls Charles Hawtrey at
his best; and, unlike the roaring army of
Yankee comedians of which this country has
had a surplus issue of late years, he never
oyer-plays. He has opened with a most effec-
tive play—it contains elements calculated to
appeal to all classes, from the gory-minded

D’Alvarez finished up her return Sydney
season at Her Majesty’s during the week.
The orchestral background to the Carmen
and Samson Delilah numbers stir*ed the
Peruvian contralto so that she portrayed
these hectic heroines with even greater
warmth than when she sang to a mere piano
accompaniment. She has the credit of estab-
lishing “The Blind Ploughman,’’ “Do Not
Go, My Love,” and “O Dove That Flying”
for all time in Sydney’s concert world.

The Welsh Choral Society, led by its tire-
less conductor, E. H. Jones, took possession
of Sydney Town Hall on Saturday night,
and after the thunders of the opening “Men
of Harlech” had died down a prolonged and
mixed menu of nightingales’ tongues was
served to the scattered audience. Of the
singers, Essie Ackland was the evening’s
success, pouring out notes as softly round
as her plump little self; and Pauline Har-
ford-Foster ran her a close second. Clifford
Lathloan, Ernest Archer, Mowat Carter and
Harrison Allen were others on the pro-
gramme.

Wee Georgie Wood is still enthralling the
patrons of Sydney Tivoli with “Thicker
than Water.” Some of the pathos in this
item verges on the maudlin, at times, but
the little actor manages, by sheer genius, to
lift the thing into the realms of art. Made-
line Rossiter, famed aforetime as the Dark
Lady of the Strollers, continues to warble
creditably at the piano, and Edna Davies,
the long-distance xylophonist, has called in
a small child, aged about four, to aid, abet
and comfort her in her work. New signatures
on the wage-book are Leo Stirling, ticketed as
a Wandering Minstrel; Abbott, the Wizard,
and Preston and Perrin. Small fish when
compared to the big little star, yet passable
enough.

Mary Tickford is at the Strand in that
masterpiece of anaemia—“Little Lord Faun-
tleroy.” Betty Compson plays a triple
role at the Lyceum in “The Green Tempta-
tion.” “Habit,” at the Crystal Palace, gives
poor old Sassiety some terrific jolts, and
“The Love Flower,” bv Ralph Stock, is at
the Rialto. Enid Bennett appears in
“Keeping Up Pace With Lizzie” at Hoyt’s,
whiie “Over the Hill” has entered on its
second watery knot at the Globe. “A
Daughter of Australia” is cramming the little
Shell, eloquent proof of the fact that the
local picture is what the local public wants
when the said picture is anything like well
dune.

Of Lambert, Lindsay and some others:—
The Society of Artists’ annual exhibition at Sydney
Education Galleries is an improvement on the last, but
its higher level is chiefly accounted for by some
half-dozen exhibitors. George Lambert’s paintings
- more especially his Portrait of Mrs. Ernest Watt
and “White Glove”—corner the limelight, the
latter picture being marred only by the considered
sensationalism of its treatment. For qualities of
light, “The White Glove,” “Glass and Silver,”
“Weighing the Fleece” and the attractive portrait
of Thea Proctor are this artist’s best, but none of
them goes far enough to carry a convincing illusion
of reality. In his portrait of Mrs. Ernest Watt he
shows a distinct tendency to caricature, with the
apparent object of achieving decorative distinction.
Like all true artists, Lambert paints for posterity.
Yet he forgets, seemingly, that posterity is sure to
apply to the art of to-day the unconscious test which
we apply to the art of yesterday, the result of
which impels us to acknowledge Rembrandt, Velas-
quez, Titian, Vermeer and the others as master-
painters of their respective periods. Except in the
matter of drawing, Lambert is not greatly concerned
with visual truths. Generally, he makes a careful
record of proportions, but at the same time treats
lightly the equally important matter of tone, which re-
veals depth, the other half of form. Moreover, even
when striving after true drawing and textures, he
still insists on the importance of his conscious tech-
nique, making its studied excellence the first in-
terest of the beholder at the expense of what he
observes. AVhich, in a sense, is absurd. After all,
no normal individual sees nature as a series of de-
lightfully crisp and graceful brush strokes. Again,
in this show, as in the last, Lambert’s remarkable
facility is only equalled by that, of Norman Lindsay,
as exhibited in his splendid “Wagner” and in his
other pen-drawings, and etchings in the illustration
section. Elliot Gruner shows a big landscape which
falls considerably below his “Morning Light” stand-
ard, its flatness being accentuated by his small
“August Morning’’ and excellent little “Interior.”
John Longstaff is represented by a facile painting
of the lady who won the Evening News beauty
competition. It contains all the fashionable por-
trait-painter’s formula;, but few of the qualities
which make for artistic solidity. W. B. Mel nuc-
has a forcible child-portrait; and Hans Hey-
son sends some brilliantly-painted water-colors,
his best being “The Hill Farm.” Harold
Parker, with “Iris,” a marble bust; B. E. Minus,
with a water-color, “Metalling the Hull”; Bernard
Hall, C. Hampel, A. E. Newbury, Lloyd Jones,
Howard Ashton and Percy Leason contribute the
rest of the notable work. The last-named attempts
with some portraits and still-lifes to demonstrate
the ascendancy of Meldrum’s principles.
Much nonsense of an offensive nature has
been published concerning the alleged danger
of Henry Lawson being buried as a pauper.
There was never the remotest possibility of
such a thing. The Fuller Government
though it jibbed at a State funeral, was ready
to accord him a public one. Mrs. Lawson
is in a financial position to bury her rela-
tives decently ; and in any event, The Bul-
letin would not have allowed one of its
oldest and most distinguished contributors
to be borne to his last rest in any but a
fitting manner. As a matter of fact, Law-
son’s wife and children had already begun
arrangements for his interment when W.
M. Hughes, with his matchless flair for the
effective gesture, proffered the more impres-
sive ceremonial. Almost as objectionable to
Henry’s family is the suggestion that a
public subscription should be taken up for
them. Like many another wayward man
of genius, he ignored his domestic re-
sponsibilities, and for many trying years
Mrs. Lawson has had to fend for
herself and educate her two children.
The worst part of her struggle is long since
over, and the boy and girl are self-support-
ing; so that the last thing any of them now
desires is charity, in whatever guise it is
presented. The tribute to the dead poet’s
memory that wouldjmost appeal to his family
is a public memorial of some sort—prefer-
ably a statue. The Bulletin is prepared
to back any scheme on " such lines, and to
move for a site in the Sydney Domain in
the neighborhood of the statue to that other
poet of the people with whom Lawson had
so much in common —Robert Burns.
“Thorold Waters”: Astor is not in the re-
cords as having built the big opera house in
London Kingsway, as asserted by “R.D.”
(B. 81/8/’22). Had he mentioned Lord
Howard de Walden, the millionaire, who
writes librettos for unsuccessful grand
operas, he might have got a little closer to it.
but Oscar Hammerstein, the Noo Yoick im-
presario, raised the requisite capital from
miscellaneous sources and built the place.
If he had provided the right operatic goods
he would never have come such a bump. He
pinned his faith to ancient stuff of the “Tro-
vatore” type interlarded with Howard de
Walden opera, and engaged some really
dreadful Italians and Amurricans to inter-
pret them. About the only two of his artists
who could stand up against even the second-
ary run of Covent Garden people were tenor
Orville Ilarrold and light-soprano Felice
Lyne, the last-mentioned being of a type
usually allotted to supporting roles, such as
Musetta in, “Bohfcme.”
THE GREAT LOVER.
The game of love Jean Paurel played
Whilst, on the stage, his singing
A world of widow, wife, or maid —
Or passionate or clinging:
The clean edged, or the somewhat frayed—
To Jean, embrace was bringing.
But stealthily his voice decayed,
For Time its flight was winging.
Young manhood waned,' then middle-age
Brought grief that seemed appalling;
The singer now must quit the stage:
His voice, so long enthralling,
Was gone, quite gone. On Fame’s last page
He saw grey shadows falling
Until, his sorrow’s to assuage,
He heard —a woman calling.
What mattered grief, w’hat mattered fame?
Remorse had ceased from preying:
Did conscience utter words of blame
Jean heeded not its saying.
Pass out the maid, show in the darnel
Still shines the sun for haying ;
Love is the one and only game
That experts keep on playing.

“J.F.H.”: "There is no home-made drama
in Australia,” said Tallis to a London in-
terviewer. Neither would there be any
home-made cakes, tarts or sausages if there
was no local demand. Let Tallis and his
fellow-managers create and foster a demand
for the home-made Australian play, und an
adequate supply will be forthcoming. Had
the “entrepreneurs” of the period been all
Tallises there would have been no Eliza-
bethan drama. Only translations and adap-
tations of “established successes” in Venice
and Madrid.
“T.P.”: Stage customs change. In my
callow days, when the curtain dropped, it
never went up again for a repetition of the
final tableau. Instead, old William Cres-

wick (say) would
stalk in front of
the curtain, lead-
ing Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis. With be-
coming gravity
they would patrol
the stage and dis-
appear, bowing
backwards, through
the opposite door.
Then would G. R.
Ireland take his
call, followed by
Fred Appleton, and
so on through the
cast. When the
applause wane d,
the super standing
behind the entry
door kept it wag-
ging, to indicate
that there were
more to follow. We
saw nothing pecu-
liar in Cordelia,
with the red mark
of the rope on her
fair neck, tripping
across the boards
and smiling gaily
en route. Electri-
cians were then
unknown, mechani-
cians were beery
and primitive, but ah ! we had actors.
“Pitt Streeter” : There is less ragtime in
the Williamson revue, “The Peep Show,”
than in any piece of its class submitted to
(or inflicted on) us for years. For this
I propose, second and carry unanimously
a vote of thanks. British comic songs may
not be works of art, but I defy anyone to
listen to the words and tunes of the old-
timers in that Song Shop scene, and not
to admit that they are preferable in every
respect to the vulgar, epileptic, nigger ditties
we have been deluged with for a decade.
“Nella”: "The Man They Could Not
Hang,” that made-in-Australia bugaboo pic-
ture which has been horrifying the Back-
blocks for a year or more, got as far out
as Bobbra Wobbra last week, and all the 6litc
of the district lined up to be thrilled. The
picture made a profound impression. Even
the peroxided pianist was captivated, and
gazed with starting eyes at the screen as
she churned out appropriate jazz music.
When it came to the dread ordeal of the un-
happy John Lee, who stood on the drop
with the cap over his eyes, waiting to he
jerked into Eternity, the audience held its
breath in expectation of the sickening thud.
Just then the inspired but enthralled piano-
lady dashed off into
AVe don’t want to lose you
But we think you ought to go.
And the tension was relieved.
“Blackfriars”: I would never trouble about
the ballet in England while the tennis cham-
pionships are on. The cameras of London’s
illustrated dailies lie in wait for moments
when the lady champions reveal much in
addition to their prowess. Misses Ryan and
O’Kane and Mrs. Mallory all show as much
gartered limb as anyone should reasonably
expect, but Suzanne Lenglen seems to have
won her supremacy by a superb high kick
that none of her rivals can emulate. Suz-
anne must dread the coming of the eventual
girl who does a “cartwheel” in short skirts
while the ball is shooting across the nets.
Presently we shall have the slow films show-
ing us exactly what occurs in these moments
of intense agility.
“Plasmon”: Though some of the Mel-
bourne papers dead-head on the Firm to the
extent of having everybody “on the door,”
from editor t o
office-boy, they
don’t show much
gratitude for favors
received. In fact,
they are now re-
vealing a tendency
to become markedly
critical and to
assail on high
moral grounds
shows like “The
Naughty Princess”
and “Parlor, Bed-
room and Bath,”
which, apart from
a couple of dubious
lines, are no more
noxious than scores
of other entertain-
ments of the same
kind that have been
effusively praised.
Melbourne Herald,
for instance, slated
the “indecency” of
the aforesaid at-
tractions in a
leaden leaderette.
But it never prints
a line about the
moral rottenness of
the films that help
to evolve the slut-
tish flappers and
boy- bushrangers
whose exploits the
Herald details in
columns of baleful
“The Great Lover,” at
Melbourne Royal.

rubbish. Of course, the film managements
advertise enormously.
“O.Iv.”: “T. 0.1.” (B. 7/8/’22) mentions
that eccentric Walter Montgomery committed
suicide in 1871, “a few days after his mar-
riage to a lady who, it transpired, had
already acquired a husband.” The death of
Montgomery was one of the events of 50
years ago that G. R. Sims wrote of remin-
iscently in August last year. Thus:—
Fifty years ago I was a great admirer of Walter
Montgomery. Greatly daring he had taken the
Gaiety Theatre in July and produced Shakspeare
with disastrous results. On August 30, 50 years ago,
Montgomery married a charming young actress who
had made a great success as Pauline in “The Lady
of Lyons.” On September 1 he and his bride
arrived at Waterloo, and, taking a hansom, drove to
Montgomery’s rooms, in a street near Albemarle-
stieet. Montgomery got out of the hansom and ran
upstairs. His wife followed him, and found him
lying on the floor of the bedroom with his brains
blown out. When he was buried at Brompton
Cemetery his two-days’ bride dropped her wreath of
orange blossoms on the coffin.
Presumably it was the failure of his season
at the Gaiety which settled Montgomery.
The fact of his wife beiijg a grass-widow
(if she teas already married) didn’t account
for that bullet in the head.
“Second Murderer”: The cleverly-worked
“Dowfi Dickens-street” scene in “The Peep
Show,” at the Sydney Royal, is altogether
charming to ma and pa, or to gran’pa and
gran’ma, but Gwladys yawns and votes it
a prehistoric bore. Even the programme is
out of its depth over this particular “Peep,”
for it calls Jo, “Joe,” and Bill Sikes becomes
“Sykes.” The author seems on surer ground
“Down in Dixie Land” and thereaway. The
programme is a curious gallimaufry, which
mentions seven times in relation to seven
“Peeps” that Light o’ the Moon is enacted
by Kathlyn Hilliard. On an “East Lynne”
programme one never expects to see the lead-
ing ladv’s name down for Lady Isabel five
times—once for each act of that popular
chestnut In the cast of “The Peep Show”
Mona Magnet is mentioned 14 times oppo-
site various characters ranging from the
ridiculous to the preposterous, but as this
energetic artist plays about 40 different
parts successively and successfully, she de-
serves all the publicity she gets.' Her un-
flagging vivacity is the life of a lively show.
“T. 0.1.”: A boyhood’s friend writes re
George Fawcett Rowe (B. 31/8/’22) :
Old memories started to life again when I read your
reference to George Fawcett. I never missed him
as a kiddy, and saw him do Widow Twankey a score
of times. Julia Mathews was Aladdin, and Richard
Stewart, Nellie’s father, was in the cast. I also recol-
lect him producing “Barnaby Rudge,” with Rosa
Dunn as Barnaby; William Hoskins, Bill Ryan and
Clarence Holt were in the cast, and Fawcett was
Miss Miggs. Evidently you forgot about George
Fawcett’s Harlequin in the pantomime of either ’6l
or 62 at the old Princess’s, Julia Mathews as
Columbine, Dick Stewart clown, and Joe Downey
pantaloon.
Forget I did; but my old friend bus
adequately filled the gap.
“Quince”: Allan Wilkie’s Nick Bottom struck
me as deserving a word of special commenda-
tion. I have seen Nick, the weaver, played
by actors of greater distinction, and in
theatres with a wealth of stage accessories,
but seldom with so much quiet (as well
as noisy) humor, and never by one who
looked the part better. I always pictured
the real Bottom as a man who would have
been a butcher if he hadn’t been a weaver
or had lived in times when weaving gave out
as an occupation. Wilkie’s N. 8., with the
addition of an apron and a steel, stands be-
hind many counters where meat is sold. He
was exactly like the butcher in Lewis Car-
roll's “Hunting of the Snark”—the chap who
could only kill beavers. There are few actors,
it seems to me, nowadays, who could present
this delightful character more vividly with
intention, although there are quite a number
who frequently give Bottorn-like exhibitions
without in the least suspecting it themselves.
“Orb”: Redge Carey, who “produces” the
prologues for the Union Picture Theatres, in
Sydney, seems to have a holiday job in stage-
managing Nellie Stewart as “Conscience”
at the Globe Theatre. He had to graft harder
when I saw him on tour with the Firm’s
“Fair and Warmer” co. five years ago. He
was s.m. of that show; also lie blew on for
a part or two during the evening; and in
his spare time he was the orchestra, dashing
round to the front as occasion required, and
thumping out the necessary entr'acte and
incidental music on the piano. Redge’s father
was a capable comedian in the old days
with the Broughs, and before that he used
to storm the smalls with his own show. I
remember him in the long ago as a capital
Bosco Blithers, the man with the three hats
in' “Mixed.”
“Fax”: What the Pioneer Players must
have, if they are to do more than crawl
along to generous Australian support, is an
enthusiastic publicity man to keep their
banner waving in the press. Here is Stewart
Maeky’s rather interesting play, “John
Blake,]’ running for several successive Thurs-
day nights, and never a paragraph in the
papers concerning the historical accuracy of
the story, or the “cruel convict days,” or
the improvement in the performance since
the first Thursday, or what not. Australian
drama in itself has no magic art to enable
it to get along without advertisement.
Thursday nights at the Temperance Hall
must be talked about, with artfulness afore-'
thought, seeing that young Australian
drama will not dramatically advertise itself.
“On Our Selection.” at the theatre, had a
best-seller book to advertise it ere ever the play
was born. “The Sentimental Bloke” wiil
have had the book to boost it. Yet Dennis
and Bert Bailey will not forget to weigh
in with publicity stunts. My oath!
Thorold Waters”: No ; I did not joke in
relating that William Parkinson described
Edward Lloyd as nothing more than a
counter-tenor (B. 7/9/’22). Neither did
Parkinson joke, for Lloyd emerged from a
place in one of the Royal chapels with the
high and reedy quality which eventually
developed into the pretty lyrical tenor that
“Abbot Park” heard in Australia. The real
joke lies in “A.P.’s” assertion that Lloyd
declaimed Waener “in a style that made
Teutonic audiences in London shout for joy.”
Edward hadn’t the beginnings of a Wagner
voice or a declamatory method, and no Eng-
lish tenor ever hit the Hun fancy as a per-
fect Wagnerian until John Coates, previ-
ously nopular as an alleged baritone, sought
the higher altitudes. “Tannhauser” and
“Lohengrin” were the only two Bayreuthian
operas that even the advanced Britishers list-
ened to in Lloyd’s day, and had he essayed
the part of the knight errant who strayed
after Venus, his light balladistic voice would
have crashed in a month. A singer who is
known to have cleared £30,000 from royal-
ties on Stephen Adams’s ballads had little
time for Wagner, anyway.
“0.K.”: Some of the sayings attributed
to D’Alvarez by the publicity man are not
confirmed by one’s experience. For instance,
“I cannot imagine the greatest art coming
from anyone who is not overwhelmed with
the message.” What is exactly meant by
“the message” I don’t know, but I will swear
that Sarah Bernhardt never was "over-
whelmed” by her feelings. I have seen
that great emotional artist on at least two
occasions hastily fixing up her back hair at
supremely tragic moments. Also. I have a
vivid recollection of Sarah feeling for her hair-
pins whilst she was supposed to be carried
away by grief for the fate of her lover, m
the last scene of "Theodora.” She was noted

raine pair, absorbed in the serious busi-
ness of entertainment.
for her inattention to the security of her
back hair, and the matter-of-fact manner
in which she would give it a pair of helping
hands when a breakaway was threat-
ened. And how would it be if the
passionate D’Alvarez, with eyes closed and
tears in her voice, swayed by emotion and
supported by the piano, were to feel a
shoulder-strap slipping or a couple of hooks
giving way? Would she not expose the arti-
ficiality of her passion by taking measures to
avert a catastrophe?
“Nero”: One of the Brisbane dailies calls
him Sir Hugh Ward. A case of intelli-
gent anticipation, perhaps. When the post-
war “honors” were being considered Ward
was recommended for a knighthood, but it
didn’t go through. A C.M.G.-ship was (it is
said) refused. In those days Hugh was
keen on getting a real handle to bis name,
but now that they are given for eminence
in the pony-racing and nigger-minstrel pro-
fessions, his ardor may hava cooled.
“Gnarek”: “Orb’s” attempt to show that
Allan Wilkie has given more unbroken per-
formances of Shakspeare than Frederick
Benson (B. 31/8/’22j is valorous, but ridi-
culous. During the 1914-18 disturbance
Benson did the round of the British garri-
son theatres. He attended a function given
by some literary Diggers at Tidworth in
1918, and informed the company that he
hadn’t missed playing the Bard for o.ne
night in three years. Even on Sunday the
Y.M.C.A. used to rope him in for a lecture-
recital on Shakspeare. He usually con-
cluded with the wonderful prayer from
Henry V.: —
O God of battles, steel my soldiers’ hearts!
“Fax”: G. R. Sims committed at least
one serious error in journalism. It was an
article in London Fun, then edited by his
friend Henry Sampson, violently attacking
Henry Irving for his "glorification or
crime” in such characters as the murderous
burgomaster of “The Bells,” the murderous
schoolmaster, Eugene Aram, a self-supposed
fratricide in “Philip,” a triumphant butcher
in “Richard the Third,” and so forth. The
thing was a silly attempt to score a sensa-
tional advt. for Fun at the exoense of the
sensational actor of the period; silly, be-
cause you can’t be a tragedian without kill-
ing people on the stage or behind the scenes.
Irving sued the paper for criminal libel,
but accepted an abject, apology in court as
sufficient compensation. Previous to that
incident young Sims had made his d£but as
a dramatic author with an adaptation of a
French play, at the suggestion of the famous
old bohemian actor. E. J. Odell. It was
tried at a matin6e, and Odell, William Rig-
nold and George Anson were included in a
strong cast. The author used to refer with
pride to the talent he was able to get for
the one performance of his maiden play in
the days when he worked in the city from
10 till 6, then wrote songs, stories, rhymes
and paragraphs till midnight, before going
forth to live the riotous life until 3 a.m..
and two hours later on Saturdays. No
wonder Sims complained a deal of dyspep-
sia when his youth had fled.
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The lady at the picture-show
Adores the cave-man’s ways.
I am assuming that you know
These stirring Yankee plays,
Wherein the hero to his horse
Uplifts the scoffing maid,
And carries her away by force
Along the raging torrent’s course.
She’s scornful but afraid.
He grins a, horrid sort of grin,
And at his old log hut
By her back hair he tows her in,
And giving her a cut
With whip or belt, he bids her get
His supper right away,
And should the lady sulk or fret
He stands around, and will not let
Her sleep until the day.
He beats her till his chop she grills,
And then she loves him so,
And how the she-spectator thrills!
She also cries “Bravo!”
She loves the troglodytish style
Of this stern man and fat,
Admires his fierceness and his guile,
And she is wishing all the while
She might be loved like that.
Then if at home her own old man
Bucks up a little bit;
If cavemen methods he should plan,
And start her with a .hit,
Or bullyrag her for his sport.
There is a family meeting.
With methods summary and short
He’s dragged off to the Oity Court,
And punished for wife beating!
VIOTORIA.

The Wolseley Ten has put up
29 New Records
yHE WOLSELEY is one of Eng-
-1 land’s most famous cars. For
many years it has held the high-
est reputation for perfection of design,
thoroughness of workmanship and for
astounding performances. That repu-
tation is again enhanced by the fact
that during the year a Standard Ten
has created, at Brooklands, 29 new
records for speed and endurance.
There is no other car of its size and
rating that has ever put up so remark-
able a performance.
r "RHE WOLSELEY is easily the
| finest car for Australian road
conditions. There is no other
car of its rating that can equal it in
road performances, steady, all-the-
year-round economy of fuel, oil and
tyres. Its freedom from repairs is
simply phenomenal, due, of course, to
the superb English workmanship.
The Wolseley will cost less for repairs
than any other car of its class. It will
do anything that other cars of a rating
of sh.p. to Bh.p. higher will do, and
do it better.
You cannot buy Better Cars than tbe English,
and Wolseley is the Best English Car of its class.

NOTIONS
"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
Beauford beat Gloaming in the nine-fur-
long Chelmsford Stakes, and 65,000 excited people
saw him do it. It was a fine race from start to
finish, and the closing struggle between the two
champions was superb, but the merit of the win-
ner’s achievement has been exaggerated, “lie got
away badly, was blocked at the turn, came through
bn the outside and ran home on the bit,’’ said an
enthusiastic admirer of the Newcastle (N.S.W.) horse,
and the same account, with verbal elaborations, has
appeared in more than one Sydney paper. But it
is unjust to Gloaming.
Certainly, the brown gelding dwelt at the bar
tier (he wasn’t the last to leave at that), but they
started off so slowly that he was up with the field
and in a good position before half-a-furlong had been
traversed. It is also true that the bay had the
inside running—a questionable advantage .at Band-
wick when the going is on the heavy side, as it
was on Saturday. But all the “blocking” that hap-
pened was harmless. Finding that there was no
‘right-of-way on the rails, Wood, on Beauford, got
a clear passage by working- round two horses, and
he had airiple time to do it in. This manoeuvre took
less out of the brown than the effort to shake off
Furious took out of the bay. For seven furlongs
first Tressayr and then Soorak had kept Gloaming
company at the head of the field. When the young-
sters dropped back beaten, Furious moved forward,
and the bonnv chestnut hung on to him so gal-
lantly that it momentarily looked as if she had
his measure. Having settled Furious, who ran a
great and game race (it transpires that she was
kicked at the barrier and galloped on during the
race), he had to take on Beauford, who was coming
with a brilliant run on the outside. Answering
Young’s call with every ounce that was in him,
the bay struggled on, but the brown drew level, got
his head in front, then his head and shoulders, and,
finally, three parts of his long body. David, pass-
ing Furious in the last few strides, and finishing
just as fast as Beauford, was 2j lengths away. Even
Seng vvas a close fifth, Prince Charles (last at one
stage) a respectable sixth, and Violoncello a hor-
rible last. Beauford was 10 to 9 on, Gloaming
2 to 1 against, and the time was lmin. 53see. —
ljsec. outside the record.
E. A. Connolly’s Epsom candidates, Rostrum and
Fleuriste, ran first and second in the seven-furlong
Tramway Handicap. Rostrum, a black horse of
commanding appearance, carried his 9st. 31b. like
a champion, and with 51b. less he looks to have
a mortgage on the big mile handicap, especially
ns he finished well and covered the seven furlongs
in lmin. 26isec. Owing to his drawing No. 30
marble he wasn’t backed with the customary Con-
nolly spirit, and his price in the ring oscillated
between 10’s and 20’s. The tote paid better than
12 to 1. All the same, some of the 30 horses he
defeated will show out much better presently. The
field was too large by half, and it was a rotten start.
Among the distance horses, Wirraway did best.
Though burdened with 9st. lib., and still a bit
above himself, he was backed down to 5 to 2 in the
10-furlong Spring Handicap, and duly landed the
stake; albeit the second favorite, Molyneux (Bst.
51b.), was only a neck away at the end after a
thrilling fight up the straight. Llanthony was a
fair third, Prince Sandy (fading at the finish) fourth,
and Cupidon (at the rear early) next. Marsden
will have to put a lot more work into Prince Sandy
if he is to see out the Metropolitan course.
Among the three-year-olds, nothing shaped more
impressively than the Victorian colt Caserta (Comedy
King—Sessa), who, carrying 9st. 51b., came from
a long way back and won the mile Novice Handi-
cap with ease from the well-tried Duke Napoli and
the Newcastle youngster Cliffdale. He will be hard
to beat in the Derbies. Soorak and Tressayr showed
speed in the Chelmsford Stakes, but gave no evi-
dence of stamina. In other races Bardoleur and
Mont Clair cut up badly.
Teremarau disappointed in the first division of the
mile Welter, and Sea Risk in the second division.
Both were ridden by apprentices, so as to get the
71b. allowance, and it looked as if a stronger lad
would have got Sea Risk home, as he was rushed
from third last to fourth, after rounding the turn.
There ought to be a limit to the proportion of
apprentices that may be employed at Randwick and
Flemington. There are so many of these green
youngsters about that capable horsemen find it
increasingly hard to get mounts. Also, there are
too many races thrown in the air, and too many
accidents caused, by had riding.
At the moment it is doubtful whether
Beauford and Gloaming will fight their battle over
again in the mile Hill Stakes at Rosehill next Satur-
day. If they do this page will risk another ticket
on the old ’un, who has Vlh. the better of the weights.
Caserta looks like winning the Rosehill Guineas,
and if Alfort is allowed to start in the seven-fur-
long Camellia Stakes (he is at present under the
tan for bad behavior at the barrier), he will make
things interesting for the others. Failing Alfort,
Gilray or Duriwil may be worth backing.
■* * * *
“0.K.”: Eric Connolly’s old reputation as
a racing tipster renewed its youth in Melbourne re-
cently, by the results of a telegram published in the
new Spobting Globe. E.C.’s selections of six likely
winners at Moorefield were published on the Wednes-
day before the meeting. Only two of the good
things started, and both of them won —at 4 to 1 and
9 to 2 respectively, s.p. They were the ALL. geld-
ings, Absurdum and Molyneux. Connolly, how-
ever, is a more reliable tipster of other people’s
horses than when he sanguinely predicts the triumph
of his own, especially when they have a good distance
to travel. Several of his warmest fancies have
gone near it, hut they didn’t quite get there. His
best prophetic courses are from 6 to 10 furlongs, his
views concerning stamina and “searching prepara-
tions” being less trustworthy.
“Fax” : Whilst Prince Charles was left in
the Melbourne but scratched for the Caulfield
Cup when first acceptances came due, imported Hay-
hope (one of Scobie’s string) remained in the Caul-
field, but was scratched for the Melbourne. There
isn’t much encouragement to back a horse for the
11-mile event if he isn’t reckoned a possibility for
the 2 miles, run 17 days later. The fact that Wish
Wynne is not fond of a distance was frankly admitted
by scratching her for both Cups, whilst accepting with
her for the Cantala Stakes. On the other hand, Furious
was scratched for the Cantala, but accepted with for
the Metro, and the Cups, as though the lovely mare
were reckoned a good stayer, which she probably is
not. A lot of sound judges refuse to think of Furi-
ous staying even 12 furlongs in the fastest handicap
company until she has actually done it. True, the
beauteous daughter of The Welkin has won Derby,
Oaks and Leger. That doesn’t prove her a real good
stayer up to 12 furlongs. Salitros won two Derbies
and a Leger. But he was no Cup horse.
Three tied in the final stage of the King’s
Prize at Perth (W.A.), S. J. Jackson (N.S.W.),
Bltirton (Kalgoorlie)
and Logan (Vic.)
scoring 407 each.
Logau dropped out in
the shoot-off, and,
after breaking even
again, Jackson got a
bull’s-eye to the West-
ralian’s inner, and the
prize was his. Also
the cheering and the
chairing. Jackson,
who has a fine record
in these competitions,
and is a rattling good
sportsman, handed £lO
back to the Westralian
association to buy a
future trophy. In the
grand aggregate he was
second, with 416, to
the Victorian Edwards
(417), Garrity, a
Groper (414), being
third. Westralia won
the tea m s’ service
match after a tie with
Vie.
E. J. CAMPBELL,
Victorian 'billiard
champion.
“Linesman”: Patterson declared in an
interview with a New York reporter that he would
never have heard the last of it in Australia had
he played O’Hara Wood, instead of Anderson, against
Tilden on the third day of the Davis Cup finals.
The comment is an uncalled-for disparagement of
Wood’s ability as a singles player, especially after
his fine work against the Spaniards and Frenchmen
and his unquestionable brilliancy at Wimbledon.
There he worked his way into the “final eight,” and
was only put out by Anderson after a five-set battle
which, as the Cornstalk admitted, was the hardest
engagement of his career. Probably Wood would
not have beaten Tilden, but if he had been
tried he would have done better than Patterson
against Johnston, who won by 6-2, 0-2, 6-1. Wood
hasn’t any of the spectacular qualities of Patterson
or Anderson in singles, but his greater range of
strokes, his surer backhand, and his strength as a
volleyer, which he showed in the dramatic collapse
of Tilden and Richards in the doubles, would make
him a harder nut to crack than Patterson was at
the same meeting. I shouldn’t be surprised that
when the American Lawn Tennis Association comes
to ranking the world’s players Wood will be up
among the first ten, and probably next to Patterson,
if not Anderson. If he were to be considered for
all-round talent in both singles and doubles he
wouldn’t be very far behind Tilden and Richards.
# * * *
“15-30”: Tennis writers on this side have
been inclined to draw exaggerated conclusions from
Johnston’s fine victories over Anderson and Patterson
in the struggle for the Davis Cup, which the U.S.
retains. Some even hail him as a superman, entitled
to share the pedestal with Norman Brookes. Of
course, the comparison is absurd, inasmuch as John-
ston is a singles champion only, whereas Brookes
excelled in doubles as well. And even as a singles
player Johnston hasn’t the outstanding qualities
displayed time and again by the veteran Australian.
Johnston outed Anderson and Patterson this time
without dropping a set, but he unquestionably faced
an Anderson short of practice, and in Patterson had
an adversary whose infamous backhand is a source
of perpetual astonishment to first-class men. A
man of Johnston’s machine-gun accuracy in drive
and service, and revealing no vulnerable point for
attack, wouldn’t get a headache thinking out a
simple method for the massacre of Patterson. Here
was a big, burly character, vivid but unreliable in
service, and so notoriously fond of taking everything
on his forehand that his defeat was merely a matter
of slamming his backhand and working him into
positions which left most of his court open to the
invader. No doubt Tilden followed the same tactics
against him —as he did before in Auckland in 1920
—and the fact that he had a harder game than
Johnston means only that he was less skilful than
his partner. But it can be said for Tilden that in
both his singles matches he could always produce
the requisite ace when it was needed to restore his
supremacy at a pinch. The remarkable fighting-
power of the man is illustrated in his collaring the
second set in his match with Patterson when the
Australian led 8-7 and 40-15 on the Yankee’s ser-
vice. Likewise in his battle with Anderson, when
the tall Cornstalk bad grabbed two sets and they
were tour games all and 30-love in Anderson’s favor
m the fourth session, Tilden recovered marvellously,
and then took the match. The greatest praise is due
to Anderson, however. Lack of condition may account
tor his failure to turn Tilden’s narrow victory into
an equally narrow one for himself, but to be only
two games down in the aggregate against the admitted
woild s champion puts him alongside Johnston and
Richards. the only other players that have fully
extended the Philadelphian to date.
North Sydney (who couldn’t beat Univer-
sity last month, though Uni. were subsequently routed
by the despised St. George) ran rings round Glebe
in the final of Sydney Rugby League premiership
scoring 35 (7 tries 7 goals) to 3(1 try). It was
a peculiar ending to a most unsatisfactory competi-
tion. Another such season of in-and-out football
and nothing will remain of Rugby League but a
malodorous memory. Horder was the hero of a
one-sided match, contributing two of the premiers’
tries and all their goals. Of the 341 points regis-
tered by North in premiership matches he got 151
(17 tries 50 goals), a truly great record. In the
semi-final for the City Cup North defeated South
Sydney by 22 (4 tries 5 goals) to 6 (2 tries). This
also was an uuinteresting game, except for 11 order’s
brilliance. Coming in from the wing to stand-off
half, when Duncan Thompson was outed. he played
magnificently, and notched 2 tries and 5 goals. V
Sheehan, South’s flying winger, sustained a dislo
cated shoulder, and lost his place in the N.S.W tour
mg side which left that night for Maoriland.
Eastern Suburbs and Glebe, the other semi-finalist*,
met at the Sports Ground. On the previous Satur
day Glebe had beaten East by 21 to 12. This time
the Reds were never in the hunt, East winning by
21 (5 tries 3 goals) to 3 (1 try). And .nobody said
a word. The crowds at all three games were
significantly small. Lumped together, they wouldn’t
equal the average attendance at an average match in
Melbourne—say, between Richmond and Fitzroy. But
the Australian game exhibits a most healthy and
vigorous aspect, whereas Rugby League, as at
present conducted, has the death-dew on its brow.
Bv playing a draw (6-all) with Glebe-
Balmain, Manly became N.S.W. Rugby Union pre-
miers for the first time. These clubs have had note-
worthy clashes this season. The first was drawn ((»-
all), and the second went to Manly by 11 to 9.
Manly’s record for the season was 11 wins, 1 loss
and 3 drawn games, 312 points being scored by them
and 139 against.
* * * *
“J.H.” (London) : Dropped across Mick
(otherwise the Rev. E. F.) Waddy, at Twickenham,
the other day. He is a master at Rugby School,
and in his spare time has an occasional knock for
Warwickshire. He is by no means a back number,
as Armstrong and co. realised when he made 51
against them last summer. Waddy, who has lost
the slimness that distinguished him in his Syd-
ney ’Varsity days, talks hopefully of paying a visit
presently to the land of sunshine. He thinks that
English Rugger nowadays, especially in the schools,
is. of poor quality, and that the Sidney Grammar,
King’s and Newington boys would “eat” English
P.S. fifteens like Rugby, Marlborough, Cheltenham,
Dulwich and Wellington.
* * # *
Saturday’s League games in Melbourne
finally placed Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy and Carl-
ton in the Big Four, in that order, though ’Don
may displace ’Wood this week-end. There was a
bare possibility of Richmond or Melbourne squeez-
ing Carlton or ’Roy out; but these latter battlers
were taking no chances, so ’Roy downed South Mel-
bourne by 93 to 78, and Carlton hammered Rich-
mond by 94 to 50. ’Wood simultaneously smashed
Melbourne—B2 points to 53-—and St. Kilda handed
Geelong a woodener in the shape of a score of 126
to 71. The mighty Macnamara booted 10 goals, and
from his recent performances it seems a pity St.
Kilda didn't play him earlier in the season. They
have lost most of their 10 games by a few points
only, and the accurate and powerful place-kicker
would have made much difference.
The choicest feat of the day was achieved at
North Melbourne, before 10,000 individuals, where
the locals outeu the Association minor premiers,
Footscray, by a convincing 68 to 48. Next week
North Melbourne meet Port Melbourne, and, after
that, if they win, ’Seray again, and this writer’s
blessing goeß with North. Six months ago the* suburb
had neither club, committee, team nor money, but
only a few enthusiasts. They battled along, selling
even their old footballs to provide petty cash. Up
to three weeks ago there wasn’t a stiver to spare
for travelling exes. On the other hand, Ports have
purchased two Collingwood men and ’Seray a Magpie
star and a Geelong ditto, among others, money
being no object with either club’s supporters. The
game on Saturday was unexpectedly courteous,
largely because ’Scray’s barraekers Were too flabber-
gasted to even boot the umpire.
“Winkle”: The modern barrneker is h <le-
generate beast. During the Richmond-South Melbourne
match, when Woods, South’s favorite wingman, was
on the ground writhing in agony, a horde of young
Richmond larrikins capered around him shouting
delightedly, while one of their number, with solemn
face, counted him out. Had this happened 20 years
ago it would have caused a feud and many pitched
battles, but now it passes unheeded. Richmond’s
inclusion in the League ended a feud with Port
Melbourne that started from a slighter cause and
threatened to last for ever. These teams’ last clash
at Port Melbourne was memorable. Richmond, pre-
pared for the usual trouble, included in their team
the Australian heavyweight champion boxer, Bill
Lang, and the game, though rough, was certainly
calmer for his presence. All would have been well,
too, had not Richmond won the match and deprived
Ports of their place in the final four. This, of
course, was not to be borne, so “Knobbo” Knox, the
hero of a dozen disqualifications, walked up to the
boxer as the bell rang, and chanced it, with disas-
trous results to Bill’s already eccentric nose.
Straightway, as if the blow were a pre-arranged sig-
nal, every Port barracker became a warrior; bike
chains and knuckle-dusters were used; the Richmond
players, many without changing into their clothes
were battered to the station, and their supporters,
after a long and desperate battle, forced to turn ami
run for it, were chased right into the city. Trulv
to follow football in those days was to be a brave
fellow.

When Jamito boxed Larry Junes at Syd-
ney on August 19 it was advertised as his last
fight in Australia prior to his return to his native
jungle. Nevertheless he bobbed up again at Mel-
bourne on Saturday night in opposition to Stanley
Mcßride. It would be interesting to know who
worked the oracle and how. More interesting to
discover why the White Australia policy has been
set aside for three years in the interest of thi-
favored Manilaman and the syndicate to which John
Wren reputedly belongs. For it was three years on
Saturday night since Jamito fought his first fight
in the Commonwealth
against Vince Black-
burn, and it was an
ill-starred anniversary
for Jammy. Getting
careless in the 14th
round after having
had the better of
things on points, he
stopped a speculative
right with his chin,
and Mcßride uppercut
another on the same
spot. It was the
king-hit, and the
brow’n man was car-
ried to his comer-
knocked out for the
first time in these
parts.
STANLEY
LOVE, of
Co[?]tamundra, who
defeated Larry
Jones last
Saturday.
t^le favorites went under in the ring
on Saturday night. At Sydney Larry Jones was
outpointed in 20 rounds by Stan Love, a sturdy
youngster with a punch; and in the northern capi.
Geo'ge Mendies was kayoed in two rounds by
Billy Tingle. Mendies was adjudged the winner
over Tingle in a previous scrap in the same hall.
Tingle didn’t have to wait long for his revenge.

“Dido”: Collier Smith was a large, dis-
colored pugilist, a. silent, amiable coon, who was
doing pretty well in Melbourne at the time, mop-
ping up a quantity of white trash previous to the
advent of Squires, the wind of whose redoubtable
punch frightened so many pugs into comatose fits.
The coon was being trained by Smedley for his fight
with the Preston giant, and Smedley saw a good
deal of Collier Smith’s home life. What he saw did
not impress him with his man’s chances. The big
black was habitually beaten by his wife, a little fat
virago who in her tantrums went for poor Smith
with anything handy. Once it was a frying-pan.
but when Smedley entered his fierce protest it was
a large, hardwood rolling-pin Mrs. Smith was
bouncing on Collier’s head. “Here, here,” cried the
trainer, “what the devil will my man be like bv
Monday if this goes on?" Collier Smith interposed.
‘ Lordy me, Mistah Smedley,” said he, “you let the
gal be. It amo9ses her, an’ it don’ hurt me.” But
it did hurt Collier. The story got about, his oppo-
nents were awakened to the folly of battering such a
head, and concentrated fire on Smith’s ribs, with the
result that he was beaten easily. Later on Collier
was heard in complaint. “I don’ get no fights nowa-
days. If ’twasn’t fer de lil’ missus I’d be right
clear out ob de game.”
Eric Barbour bounded into the cricket
limelight by knocking up 94 (out of 7 for 185)
against Macartney’s XI at Maitland. With Sydney
Grammar School, just on 10 years ago, Barbour
scored 856 (out of 916) against C. of E. Grammar:
later, after getting big scores for Sydney ’Varsity
and N.S.W., he left the bat at home and took up
the rifle, and did his bit in France. Barbour got
his blue at cricket and tennis. He is a son of
George P. Barbour (who repped at Rugby in the
’eighties) ; one of his brothers is at Oxford ard
another fell in the war. Macartney’s XI got 216.
A. G. Moyes, who has played for S. Aus. ami
Vic. in Sheffield cricket, collected 67, and Johnny
Taylor 54.
“ J.H.” : Young T. C. Lowry, son of the
Maorilander who owned Bobrikoff and Desert
Gold, has been doing big things with the bat for
Somerset. The youngster is at Jesus College, Cam-
bridge, and just missed a place in this year’s Xl—
one of the strongest that ever represented the ’Var-
sity. Playing against Sussex he made top score
in each of Somerset’s innings, hitting up 57 and 65,
and was principally responsible for the defeat of
Sussex. The latter’s bowlers—Tate, Cox, Roberts
and the Gilligans—are no dubs, but Lowry went for
them all impartially. He is probably the best
cricketer M.L. has yet produced.
Tom Morris, the Parramatta (N.S.W.)
swimmer, failed in his attempt to cross the English
Channel. He retired after the fourth mile. The
£lOOO prize offered by London Daily Sketch has
tempted a host of swimmers to have a cut at the
crossing, among them Burgess, who got over in
1910. Thus far Tirabocchi, tfh Italian, has gone
nearest to pulling down the money; he got within
2} miles of St. Margaret’s in 19 hours. The best
effort among the women was that of Madam Sion,
of Dunkirk, who was lifted out of the water only
four miles from Dover. She swam for 14hr. 35min.,
and is said to have traversed (her drift included)
36 miles—easily a long-distance record for a woman.
This goes to show that in favorable conditions 14
hours is plenty of time in which to cross.
THE RECORD FALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
John Brown, the good philanthropist,
Took half the stable boys in hand,
To clear their minds of murk and mist,
And make the youngsters understand
The glory of our poesy.
So he began the tale to tell
Of Lucifer’s grim fall. How he
Was east out ignominiously
From Heaven to the depths of Hell.
He read the tale in Milton’s line,
How Lucifer his headlong way
Fell, twisting, from the wrath divine
From morn to eve, a summer’s day.
One jockey boy with bristling hair
And eyes wide open listened well,
And now exclaimed: “I’m wonderin’, sir,
Who owned this great horse, Lucifer,
And who was on him when he fell!''

The Comfort of a Mind at Ease
NOTHING detracts from the joy
of motoring more than con-
tinual dread of tyre troubles —
blowouts or punctures. You feel
that they may happen at any
moment.
With Goodyear Cord Tyres this
feeling of dread is displaced by the
certainty of security. There is
the knowledge that each separate
cord has been thoroughly covered
with rubber—completely protected
from friction with its neighbour.
Consequently there is less heat and
chafing and more miles of wear
for you.
And punctures are reduced to a
minimum by the design of the All-
Weather Tread and its extra
thickness and toughness.
There are cases on record where
Goodyear Cord Tyres have run
over 20,000 miles without ever
being off the rims. Under any and
all conditions they satisfy users as
no other Cord Tyres do. The
special Goodyear constructive
features protect your safety and
insure your comfort.
Goodyear Cord Tyres are made in
Millimetre and Inch sizes, both
beaded edge and straight side
types.

increases its accommodation
now situated on fifth floor.
The Queen of the Fairy Castle sent a
message to the Golliwog that no children
should be disappointed through lack of
accommodation in "The Children’s Res-
taurant.” Mr. Golliwog had to find more
room—so the Children’s Restaurant with
its quaint decorations, wonderful cakes from
the Fairy Queen’s Castle, delicious drinks
from the Golliwog’s Spring, and the real
Golliwogs with their banjo orchestra, is now
on the fifth floor, where there is room for
all little visitors every Saturday morning.

Lady Grey-Egerton—the ex-Rupert Clarke
lady—left for London by last week’s
boat, thus cutting out the Spring
races that she once so loved. She gave a
farewell party at Menzies’, and lit up the
grey, mis£y day by wearing vivid japonica
red. it was a clingy, silky gown edged
with deep fringe, and was a climax to her
reputation as a smart frocker. She wears
her black hair, these days, parted in the
middle and smoothed back into glistening
coils. It is the way daughter Amy affected
when she roused Melbourne to a pitch of
admiration several years ago.
Lady Grey-Egerton looks years younger noiv
than she did when she was chaperoning that
bonme blooming girleen. Her mother, the
widow Cummings, came along, as did her
sister. Mrs. St. Lcger Robertson. Mrs.
Reggie Power made a foil to her mother’s
scarlet gown by wearing dark sapphire blue.
The little Loughborough lady was in black
and white.
Things must have been wild and woolly
recently at the Austral Salon, since there
is to be a "cup-and-saucer party this week,
at which the guests are to bring contribu-
tions of cups and saucers for the use of the
Salon. No mention is made of how the
stock has been depleted. Surely the solid
old dears have not been throwing the
crockery about!
It looked as though the whole of America
in Melbourne had made up its mind to cheer
Althouse and Middleton on their way at the
Town Hall concert last Wednesday week.
Pdpulaee overflowed into chairs on the plat-
form, and before the last encores had been
put through the artists were crowned with
laurel wreaths, accentuated by toy Ameri-
can flags. Scraps of conversation between
the singers and their importunate admirers
were marked by nasal accent on both sides.
In fact, the Spread-Eagle flavor was rather
overdone. Mere Australians began to think
they must retaliate with a wave of Southern
Cross sentiment for Rosina Buckman’s send-
off. Some of us forgot that the Australian
abroad does break out in that kind of way,
so the ’Murkan abroad may be pardoned.
There is a pretty story told of how Melba,
singing in opera at Covent Garden in
days when her voice was young and her man-
ner not neariy so gracious as it now is,
resisted repeated volleys of demands for the
repetition of an aria. At last came a true
Australian coo-ee from the stalls just as she
was walking off the stage. Melba stopped,
glanced in the direction of the national cry,
and gave the encore right away. It had
fetched the cold, unyielding diva.
Nesta Clarke will exchange matrimonial
vows with Sidney Sturt in a few days. As
Mrs. W.J.T. and the younger members of the
family are in England, the bride’s sister, Mrs.
Eric Harrison, will hostess the health-
drinking part of the business. The bride-
groom earns his crust in the rag trade. She
is a dressy youna' person who lately blew
back from London on the Nestor, aboard
which craft her daily dress-exhibitions
earned her the sobriquet “Madame Paquin.”
Blue-eyed Shirley Derbyshire is prepar-
ing to tread the Inky Way. She has just
bagged a journalistic diploma at one of the
English ’Varsities. Her father, Taylor
Darbyshire resigned his job as associate-
director to the J.C.W. firm some years back
to represent the Associated Press in Eng-
land.
Mrs. Norman Brookes’s new novel. “A
Soul’s Desire,” or words to that effect, is to
be launched next month. It was to have
first radiated in the Sun, but as the new
daily could not release it until January,
"The Desire” will be born in book form. The
publishers are said to be afraid the unco’
guid will raise the eyebrow of disapproval
over it —they hint it is just a little bit
naughty. And the publishers will, of course,
be painfully surprised tvhen there’s a rush to
see if it really is naughty. That is the last
thing in the world they would like to happen.
Wowsery Melbourne wakened up to an
appreciation of “Parlor, Bedroom and Bath”
during the last week’s run of the farce. The
final night saw a good house and heard a
warm chortle of laughteb Also, there were
stacks of flowers for the principals, some of
whom extxavaganced in new frocks. A pale
salmon-pink crgpe, with a real waist to it
and crinoline sides, made a great hit, and
Marjorie Bennett got into a new allurement
of lavender and ivory for the occasion.
The Yarra Glen and Lilydale Hunt Club
had its Cup run at Moonee Valley the" other
day, and when the tumult had subsided
president De Bury, of the Lilydale Hunt,
presented the utensil to Counihan, owner of
Kunjolio, amid the sobs of those who had
backed the favorite, Late Night. De Pury is
a great huntsman, and is riding all over the
country when he is not busy with his
Yerinberg vineyard. Pos. Chirnside was at
the meeting, with his adorable cheek dimple
well to the fore. He was one who could
smile over the Kunjolio win. Doctor A. is.
Syme, from Lilydale, had a gee or two on
the spot; and J. B. McArthur, who owns
Fortified, was also in the scenery.
Naval Commander Ellis —the surgeon who
was one of the people to keep an eye on the
Prince in Australia—has left the Navy, and
will in future work from a Collins-street den
and look after the health of the employees
in the Vic. Railways.
Melbournians, particularly South Yarra
and St. Kildaites. will remember Sylvia
Little, who became Mrs. Dr. Webb and sub-
sequently joined the John O’Hara co. at the
Royal, having a sit-down part in “Light-
nin’,” from which recumbent position she
rose rapidly to a talking job. She left the
co. at Maoriland, and went on to America,
where she was playing Shakspearean parts
on Broadway within a few months of her
arrival. Sylvia is now Mrs. Galbraith,
within the limits of the United States, hav-
ing divorced her doctor and wedded a heftv
young New Yorker, a civil engineer by pro-
fession. The divorce is good within the
States only, the marriage ranking as bigamy
in the full meaning of the Act in these less
accommodating parts and places. Sylvia’s
attractive little personality continues to
decorate the New York stage.
Mrs. R. W. Strangward, who passed out
at Middle Park a few days ago, was a sister
of A. R. Outrim, of Maryborough, formerly
“Father” of the Vic. Legislative Assembly.
She came to Melbourne 70 years ago ar.d
survived her husband by 12 years.
Burnett Gray, the new mayor of St.
Kilda. contributed much good prose
and verse to The Bulletin a few years
ago. His passion for writing, however,
waned during the war, in which he did his
bit as an n.e.0., and business and municipal
politics have since kept him off the Inky
Way. He is now a manufacturer’s agent,
and the flat little village of Elwood, which
has broken out in a rash of cheap villas,
loves him as the founder of its Progress
Association.
After 10 years of strenuous effort Max
Meldrum, it would seem, is coming into his
deserved own. His ofie-man show, at the
Athenaeum, has been a sensational success
in the matter of sales. The T. W. Rowes
spent £3OO there, convinced that they
were getting in return art that is going to
live, and they also sent forth to a big circle
of important people a special invitation to
come to a lecture by Max on Wednesday,
followed by a reception at the Oriental.
This is Hilda Spowers, daughter of Allan
Spowerg, Queensland’s Surveyor-General,
and one of the bright
particular stars of
the Melba Con. A
soprano is Miss
Hilda. Dame Nellie,
who has been topping
off three years of
Conservatorium pol-
ish. describes the
voice as a splendid
one, with a wonder-
fully good trill, and
wants her pupil to
take it to the Old
World. Hilda
Spowers was one of
the pages who sur-
rounded Melba in
“Elaine.” and was
one of the! girls
chosen by the Dame
to sing at her People’s Concerts. Last year
the young songbird got a flattering reception
at a big concert in her home town, Brisbahe,
and her voice, having been heard at many
Melbourne concerts, is in great request at
smart at-homes. Ruskin did the photo.
Another attempt is being made to have
the towers and spires of St. Paul’s built.
Gallons of ink have been spilt barracking,
and opr Earl was induced to use up a bottle-
ful in commending the scheme. Up till the
time of writing nobody has shelled out as
much as a fiver towards the project. About
the only way to get a move on and provide
a good bit of masonry fancy-work for a year
or two would be for the R.C.’s to challenge
the Anglicans to “race” them in finishing
the cathedrals. St. Pat’s, like St. Paul’s,
lacks three towers and spires. The rivalry
would be good for trade, and for the appear-
ance of the city as well.
Premier Lawson motored down to Port
Melbourne the other day, to have a look at
the Naldera, which had just come round
from Sydney on her way to London. He
selected the berths for himself and Mrs.
Lawson for January 6, 1923, when they
intend to start on their trip to the Cold
Land.
Humphrey is responsible for this picture
of Wing-Commander Stanley J. Goble, the
hero of a recent cable testifying to his suc-
cess in the marine
observer’s course in
London. He top-
lined the list in a
recent exam., aver-
aging 99 per cent, of
the marks in seven
subjects, including
wireless, meteorology
an d navigation.
Goble left the Vic.
Railway service for
the Empire’s good in
1915, joined the
British Air Force
and served a long
while in France,
during which he col-
lected the D. 5.0.,
D.S.C., and Croix de
Guerre. He went
to England to study for the aforesaid marine
course in 1921, after doing two years’ hard
as adviser to Australian fliers.
The other afternoon the feminine mem-
bers of the Vic. end of the Home Reading
Union met Melbourne’s leading pen-women
over the teacups as joint guests of Miss
Mcßae. Mrs. D. Avery, sec. for Australia,
who possesses a golden-toned speaking voice,
explained that the Union* wanted to culti-
vate a taste for good (not necessarily high-
brow ) literature. The Robert Best knight is
president of the Y r ic. section, and a very
enthusiastic president, too. The Union is made
up of little circles which cfln adopt the
lower, middle or higher course, each accord-
ing to its bookish knowledge. As the Best
People are starting to sniff at the jazz craze
there’s a cLance to do s me recruiting in
Toorak.
Only a modest £2034 was left behind by
Notley Moore, senior Vic. police magistrate,
who went west last month. -
Baritone Bobby Chisholm, who has sung
in “The Maid” in various parts of Australia
and Maoriland ever since his J.C.W. engage-
ment, is now warbling at the Majestic
movies during a theatrical “rest.” They
give him a beautiful harvest scene in which
to appear, and the limelight varies from
vivid sunshine for his song, “The Crown of
the Year” to soft pink for a sentimental
love ditty.
Kathleen Watson (Mrs. Ueardon, when
she is in Brisbane) must be kept ignorant of
our last week’s “star” divorce case. It was
the suit of Mrs. Moss, formerly of France,
against a husband who admitted having
“drifted” into the arms of another lady in
Melbourne, when his bride was tripping-
home to visit her wealthy pere et mere, from
whom he captured her during the war. The
French Consul had been her adviser, and she
had engaged the inevitable Woolf to come
down on the Mossy fold with a writ of dis-
solution, or whatever it is that leads to
decree nisi. The fair French petitioner won
her case—in fact there was no defence—
whereat was much ebullition of compatriotie
feeling in the corridors of the court. But
the decree nasty was more than a slap on
the face for the entente cordiale. It shook
one’s faith in Kathleen Watson’s “Henriette
Says!” which is an idealisation of Austro-
Franco matrimony. K.W.’s Henriette says:
“Truly the hearts are of gold in this end of
country where I inhabit.” And again; “I
say to John, ‘You have here the land of
the great happiness.’ ” Mrs. Moss didn’t talk
a little bit like that after her Juan had
“drifted.”
Justices Cussen and Schutt dropped into
the Softgoods Association smoke-concert the
other night to assist in welcoming A. W.
Dunlop, the new president. The association’s
orchestra, hypnotised by Cyril Brinkley,
showed up well.
Ministers Clarke and Merritt, M’s.L.C.,
as well as Premier Lawson, are leaving for
London, on the Naldera, in January. Alto-
gether, there will be a party of 10, including
each Minister’s wife, Patricia Clarke, the
Meyritt Miss, and George Mac Lean, sec. to
the Premier, who vaffltfed into that job only
the other day.
Charles Warne Smith, who recently took
the rapid turn to eternity, cut his widow
off with a shilling, and left the residue of
his estate, estimated at £2OOO. toward build-
ing the towers and spires of St. Paul’s, Mel-
bourne. She has a maintenance order
against the estate which will absorb the bulk
of the income. In any case she could,
probably, claim a share under the Mackinnon
(Widows’ and Young Children’s Mainten-'
ance) Act. Smith was formerly an inky
wayfarer. He was sub. on the Melbourne
Evening Standard (which amalgamated
with the Heraxd 28 years ago). Subse-
quently he was on Sydney Evening News,
and for several years was sec. of the Em-
ployers’ Union in Melbourne.
Chief Commissioner Clapp has put an idea
into the heads of senior schoolboys which
they are bound to make use of —to persuade
their dads (those who are well-to-do) to take
them for a trip in a train-de-luxe right round
Victoria at vacation time. The only thing
against it will be that a week will be too
short to satisfy them. The fare of £l5 155.,
with everything provided, for a 1000-mile
journey might be deemed a bit stiff for each
schoolboy—but perhaps that could he modi-
fied.
The Simon Fraser lady is handing over
Norla, her Toorak home, for a fete on Octo-
ber 7. This is to help the funds of St.
John’s Guild and the Vic. Missions to Sea-
men. Lady Forster will open the show,
which will be a garden-party punctuated by
numerous stalls, and bushranged by the
naicest flappers with sweets and flowers for
sale.
A ball will be given in the Town Hall on
October 13 to help the Broadmeadows
Foundling Home. The Lady Mayoress is
taking a keen interest in the organisation of
the whirl, and Lady Stradbroke has pro-
mised to be present.
A wise matron of South Yarra professes
to have discovered the real reason why the
Gas Fiends propose to collect their dues
quarterly, instead of monthly. The lowered
quality and raised price of gas, says the
lady, have so increased the bills that the
office foresees a day coming when the public
will revolt. A postponement of the next
pay-day is intended to delay the uproar. The
present gas account fcr any given domicile
averages twice as much as it did 10 years
ago, though the price of the article is not
double. Whether the meters’ hearts beat
faster than in pre-war days, or cooking
takes twice as long because the flames are
only half as hot, are questions the wise
wpman is now trying to solve. But about
the figures she seems pretty sure. And
figunhs, you know, are everything these
times.
The Myers’ ball this year is scheduled for
September 30, in the St. Ivilda Town Hall.
Last year this employees’ dance was so suc-
cessful that £5O was handed to the hospitals.
The Felton Bequest funds have roped in
some beautiful pieces of stained glass for
the Art Gallery. A 13th-century medallion
is one, and the other is an old English
tracery light, which dates back to 1320.
The Best lady is to give a dance and card-
party at Koovong, her Canterbury home, on
Sept. 22. She has a buxom lass just grow-
ing into debutante form, and is snaring the
astonishment of most young matrons at the
amount of entertainment a just-out daughter
demands.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
Melba broke her journey westwards to open the
exhibition of her “dear Ilans Heysen,” and a judi-
ciously-chosen list of guests turned up at the Society
of Arts Gallery to hear her do it. The Robert Bryces,
W. 11. Gill and Dr. 11. S. Ewing were among the
Melbourne visitors. Melba and the Heysens came
under the wing of Miss Murray, the T. E. Barr
.Smiths (with whom the Heysens are staying) and
the L. A. Jessops, to find a crowded room and an
amazing total of sales already recorded. Afterwards
Mrs. Barr Smith was hostess at tea at the Club, with
Melba and the Heysens as guests of honor and an
envied few to meet them.
Mrs. Guy Fisher and her two small children have
booked passages for England in the Esperance Bay,
and Miss Joan Whitby, who is off on a flying trip,
goes by the same boat. Mrs. (Dr.) Gardner, who
has . put in the last year or so visiting old friends
here and in Vic., goes back to Europe in November,
with Italy' as her first halting-place.
From England comes news of the engagement of
the youngest of the Charlie Horns’ daughters vo
an R.A.F. officer—one Henry Moody, M.C. The
Horns left here for England years ago, and latterly
have made their home in the Channel Islands.
The old students of St. Peter’s Girls’ School took
a leaf out of their brothers’ books, and had a dinner
at the Grosvenor t’other evening. A hundred or so
of them turned up, and the show went so well that
it is to be adopted as a regular annual affair for
St. Peter’s, and other seminaries will probably follow
suit. Next night there was a Prince Alfred College
dance, with the visiting team from Scotch College
as principal guests. Headmaster Bayley and his
wife —she in black eharmeuse with panels of blue-
and-gold brocade—were there, with one or two others
of-the staff, to keep a general eye on things; but
beyond that there was no one out of ’teens.
Miss Nora Kyffin Thomas has booked her passage
for Italy, and sails early in the year. She is to
go in one of the new Italian-Australian liners, and
will make her headquarters at Rome.
The Central Council of Girls’ Clubs has just fin-
ished its annual competitions. The movement here
is backed by Mrs. Darnley Naylor, the Council’s pre-
sident, Mrs. Napier Birks, Dr. Gertrude Halley, Mrs.
Charles Tood, Miss Kate Finlayson, Archdeacon Ilor-
nabrook, 'Miss Constance Barrett (who has put in
a hectic time as secretary) and other well-tried
workers. The Murrays came to see the finals and
to hand over the prizes and challenge shields.

The official opening of the Society of
Artists Exhibition was a sweltering affair
of humans oozing out the heavy humors of
winter through skins made specially porous
by the sudden Turkish,-bath atmosphere; of
new Spring footwear that gave out the pun-
gency of unmellowed leather; of new Spring
millinery that for the most part dropped
into coque plumage; of artists, their wives,
and sisters-in-law; of George Lambert, who
managed to monopolise three-quarters of
President Sydney tire Smith’s prologue; of
Norman Lindsay’s women ; of the handsome
Gov.-General, Avhose opening speech was as
fascinating as his own profile; of his gentle-
faced lady to whom Thea Proctor, meticu-
lous to her shoe-tips, presented a red
moroccoi-bound book of reproductions of the
exhibition pictures; of gentle Julian Ash-
ton, and most of his young disciples; of
In short, as one melting youth from Wayback
remarked, all Sydney’s ooze-who was wedged
into the Education Department’s gallery.
The Very Best dashed away after the speech-
making—they had been at the private view
the day before, when the Watt and the Brady
clans practically camped in front of Lam-
bert’s fascinating but too-ethereal-looking
portrait of Mrs. Ernest Watt. (“Made her
look as though she lives on Benger’s and a
dry crust,” complained a cub friend of the
family. Everybody tried to see the Lambert
portrait of the lady who looks as though
she had been about to cast her white glove
into the arena when she was suddenly de-
terred by a thought of the high cost of
kid. Its effulgent creator, tawny as
to tailoring and beard, hovered 'between a
desire not to appear too glistening and an
overwhelming instinct to remain in the
calcium-glare. Leason’s rosy-pink little lass
held her own in the public eye against the
rival charms of her high-priced and more
mature neighbors. Mrs. Bertie Kelly wan-
dered about in a Polar explorer’s outfit of
black velvet ; and Mrs. Vivers trailed black
silky draperies of the new length emblazoned
with Chinese blue embroideries. Lute Drum-
mond sandwiched in the show between re-
hearsals of two of her six stories of the
operas. Minns, as sound and unobtrusive as
his own good work, added a small blue-clad
wife to the gathering, and Lionel Lindsay
brought his flapper-daughter Jean, who in
addition to being extremely pretty, is a poet-
ess. Muriel Matters Porter walked about with
Theo Cowan. Miniature-painter Gladys
Laycock wore a small hat with an exquisite
all-over lace veil of the soft brown of a
cigar; and Florence Mofflin left her mark
on the wall in two soft silk paintings. Nor-
man Lindsay’s two sons, their locks more
Spring poet-like than ever, sneaked a bit of
Lambert’s spotlight: but the real critic of
the afternoon was the tall dentist who stood
for 10 minutes in frowning contemplation
of one of the 'canvased ladies, and then
turned to his impatient friend with a sigh,
“Front teeth formation all wrong.” adding
on a note of triumph. “Ah, I’ve got the hang
of it now. and I could put it right for her
in half-a-day!”
St. Philip’s. Church Hill, was lighted up
during last Wednesday’s storm for the join-
ing in matrimony of Constance Scott-Reed,
a most consistent V.A., and Robert Suther-
land, of Samoa. From the front pews a
handful of close relatives/: watched the' final
act of the romance, and a small battalion of
V.A.’s further down the aisle got ready a
running fire of confetti. The bride, who
is a small, rosy-cheeked lass, wore a simple
outfit of softly-shimmering whiteness and
a drooping hat of ivory satin. Petty’s saw
the cake-cutting, and out of the mountain of
telegrams the one the pair most chirped over
conveyed the congratulations of the Junior
Red Cross.
Sydney’s next big charity flutter will be
the Paper Ball, at the Wentworth, in aid of
St. Luke’s. All the usual prizes are being
offered, among the awards being an exquisite
fringed shawl given by David .Tones’, a five-
guinea cheque offered by the Wentworth jazz
band for the best character male costume,
and three guineas which dancing-teacher Reg
Glennie promises to bestow upon the most
graceful couple on the floor.
Doris Duane, the pretty English girl, who
married theatrical-managor Harry Cohen,
and so became connected by matrimony to
the Evening Star Cohens, of Dunedin
(M.L.), is at present in Queensland, play-
ins; lead in “Scandal,” her astute voun? hus-
band having bought the rights of ttiat double-
bed comedy in the place where it was archi-
tected. Harry -Roberts is the Pelham Frank-
lin in the case for the northern tour.
Jean \\ illiamson and Cecil Traill carried
out an important contract, entered into by
the parties some time back, on last Saturday
the convincing-ground being St.
Mark s. Darling Point. Jean, who is in
the lightweight class, was an absolute
knock-out in one of the ne-\v beltless,
swathed-to-the-waist frocks that are driving
the suburban dressmaker to henna and
peroxide. It fell in straight mediaeval folds
of some new material that carried the dull
glow of pewter, and was further embellished
by a train formed of heavy silver applique
lace that blushed rosily Jo a pale pink
lining. Janie. McMaster, Melanie Collins
and Ella Traill, in dull blue and mauve
trucking wreathed with mauve leaves, and
further enhanced with silver baskets spill-
ing over with mauve stock, cheered her to
the sacrifice, while Reg Preston, Eric Tucker
and Keith Traill supported the bridegroom.
Ihe party was held at the Oscar Backhouse
home, Warne, Double Bay, from which the
bride stepped on to the outer rim of the
honeymoon attired in a frock that a Thacke-
ray heroine might have worn—a large blue
and white check taffeta (in those days it
would have been lute string), very full as
to skirt, and straight and tight as to bod-
ioc. Jean, who is an orphan, is a daughter
of the George Williamsons, of Denholme,
Darling Point, and her father was the late
Dr. Mark Traill, of Burwood.
llie Cullen lady, with a diaphanous scarf
of glowing petunia-hue draping shoulders
and arms, was a harmonious note on the
Town Hall platform when, supported by her
Chief Justice* husband, she presented the
awards of the Royal Humane Society to the
year s heroines and heroes. Fanny Durack,
Mary Lovelace, and Leonie White,’ a slender
girleen who has yet to see her 16th birthday,
were among the skirted ones. Heroes there
were in abundance from a stalwart brave of
eight, Percy Watson, to shark-defier Jack
Chalmers. The latter’s little wife and small
son came along to see their soldier get his
decoration.
Thu little old cottage in Bent-street that
has huddled for so many years under the
shadow of the Aus-
tralian Club, is to
be sold by auction.
Mrs. Hill—now over
100—has lived there
since Sydney was an
infant, and her
niece, Miss Laura
Hill, has been with
he r fo r yea r s.
The Hills are re-
lated variously to
the Wentworths, the
Coopers an d the
Macnamaras; but
this one was a Pye.
and was born and
married in the
Riverston district.
The homestead bore
tbe fearsome name
o f Waawaarawaa,
which means, “eternal springs of ever-run-
ning water.” The two dwellers in the
last bit of old-time garden in Bent-street
pull up Sticks and move out to the Wool-
lahra home of Edith Mill (Miss Laura’s
niece), where a suite of rooms has been
specially built on for them. A wool-growing
nephew, Charlie Pye, of Gingie, Walgett, is
at present in Sydney.
The characters of Sydney’s big hotels
change with queer rapidity. Before the
war, and during a great part of it, every-
body who was anybody in the world which
amuses itself repaired after the theatre to
the Australia. The Winter Garden was a
riot of fair women in elaborate undress, and
brave men in more or less faultless evening
clothes. Now, the crowd that goes there is
usually on the drab, not to say, dingy, side,
and the few spectacular-looking figures are
mostly actors or actresses who are staying
there because their fathers or mothers did
it before them. The departure of “Dad”
Smith, who lqnew everyone and had a genius
for handling the rich and newly-rich, is
chiefly to blame. But the motor-car has done
its share—the motor-car and Mrs. Maclur-
can.- Whatever this astonishing lady is paid
for running the Wentworth she deserves to
have it doubled. The student of that queer
medley know'n as Sydney Society has to
betake himself to the Wentworth nowadays
in great part because of her, but likewise
because its ballroom is in a class of its own,
and the hills leading to it, which used to
worry the old-time cabhorse, have no terrors
for a modern limousine. Yet the Grosvenor
and Petty’s, which, quarter-of-a-century ago,
were patronised freely by the gay world,
remain religiously hushed. The quiet, solid
folks from the country and M.L. go to estab-
lishments of this sort, where they can drink
tea at every meal without attracting attention.
Usher’s has always been a man’s resort, and
the nearby Carlton, under the new man-
ager Levy, is forging ahead as a family hos-
telry, where the loud voice of the alcoholist
is severely discouraged, and where any wife
may safely go without fear of seeing her
husband entertaining his best-girl.
Hugh D. Mclntosh had his 46th birthday
on Sunday, and celebrated it by an ornate
meal at which Oscar Asche, Keith Smith and
other notabilities were present. Oscar
Asche. by the way, is being entertained so
persistently that he finds it difficult to get
on with the production, of his coming show.
I>r. Stewart McKay, who vies with the
Mclntosh couple as feeder of the intelli-
gentsia. had a big party for Oscar, who is an
old friend of his, last week. It occurred
at the new Ivingsclere flat, into which the
medico has moved from his too vast Eliza-
beth Bay mansion.
Here is a Notman photo of John Walter
Koseby, the kindly force behind the £50,000
objective of the
Royal Hospital for
Women, Paddington.
He has been at-
tached to the staff
of the Benevolent
Society of N. S.
Wales for 35 years,
and is one of the
most popular links
with their better-off
townspeople that the
poor families around
Thomas-street have.
He is a son of
John Roseby, one-
time member for
Shoalhaven and City
Councillor. His
uncle was the
widely-known Con-
gregational divine:
a cousin is Judge Roseby ; and his brother
is S. E. Roseby, of Water Board fame—in
short, the tracks of the Roseby clan are im-
printed on nearly every civic and educational
path in Sydney. Ivambala School is run by
more cousins.
Jennie Brenan, who made Jean and Co.,
the florists, so well known, is at present
staying in South Kensington (Eng.), with
artist Ethel Stephens, but at frequent inter-
vals she dashes away to a little cottage in
Kent surrounded by wonderful flowers and
cherries. She is leaving for Sydney again
in November, and Ethel Stephens comes with
her.
They were talking over the case of a
woman friend who had been placed by her
relations under medical inspection for sus-
pected mental trouble. “Why,” the small
woman with the Paradise plumes exclaimed,
“the dear thing is just as sane as you or I.
The doctor certified her as absolutely normal,
my dear, a.ud he was quite right. I went
shopping with her that very day, and she
bought a beautiful imported hat, plain but
good, and paid 39 guineas for it!”
The Oriental note wasn’t emphasised at
the Kimono-dance in aid of St. Margaret’s
hospital—the kim. didn’t seem to fancy
the Wentworth as much at its native soil,
and only bloomed sparsely. But the few
blooms were exotic affairs of heavy embroi-
deries on rich silk foundations. One bright
lad remarked that if he had thought of it
sooner he’d have patched the holes in his
kim., carried a tin of talc, and come as
powder and patches. Dr. Langton’s slim wife
was president of the dance committee, and
wore soft black satin ; while her sister Iver-
ven, who is one of the staff of the hospital,
enfolded herself in a striking kim., of which
the entire back was given ever to a gaily-
hued parrot. Secretary of the hospital May
Sheehan was demurely business-like in
moonlight blue effects. There was a young
man who carried about his person the stock-
in-trade of a brass foundry, and proved an
alibi by calling himself a Crusader or some-
thing of the kind. One girl said he was a
further reply to the film conundrum, “Why
Girls Leave Home” —because, she explained,
he reminded her of brasso and keeping the
bath-heater polished. An exquisite little
girl, Elsie Chong, came as a Chinese bride
in the richly colorful wedding garments
worn a quarter-of-a-century ago by her
mother. Bede Kenny, V.C., and C. E. Tay-
lor judged her worthy a special prize. Mrs.
Angus Gunn, who illustrated a Javanese
butterfly in a gauzy head-dress that looked
as though it might turn into an electric fan
at the slightest provocation, a pair of vividly-
marked georgette wings, and was otherwise
cloth-of-gold and glowing splashes, won the
prize for the most striking Oriental costume,
while Nurse Bowen carried off the kimono
prize.
Mrs. Rodney Dangar has given a beauti-
ful old Paislev shawl to Mrs. Victor White’s
already wonderful collection of furniture,
china and brass, the sale of which should do
much to swell the funds of the Cranbrook
f§te. A private view of the art show will be
held in the Lodge for four days before his
Ex. prises open the fete on the 23rd.
Mrs. S. Potts, who died at Wingham.
North Coast, t’other day, was one who did
her duty to her country from the standpoint
of population. She was the mother of 14
Twelve oi them still live— and they in turn
have added considerably to the best immi-
grants Australia knows. Mrs. Potts was
married at 17, and passed through the Last
Sliprail at SI.
A link with the Crown Colony days of
British New Guinea snapped recently when
Alls. Arinit passed out in Moresby (Papua).
Hie little silver-haired lady was the widow
/he late Capt. M illiam Edington Armit,
T it’ a pioneer explorer of Cen-
tral 1 apua, and closely identified with its
development until his death at Tamata
Mambare River, in 1901, while Resident
Magistrate of the Northern Division. Mrs
Armit was a native of Countv Kilkennv
(Ireland), and_ she arrived in British New
Guinea in 1890, after having lived through
the roaring goldfields days of early N.
Queensland. All Moresby, from the Lieut.-
Governor down, flew its flags at half-staff at
the passing of the gallant little lady.
Rosina Buckman will be the pivotal point
of two parties this week—the Lady Mayoress
is staging one, and the Musical Association
extends the hand of greeting at Farmer’s
on the 15th.
The Paper Ball for St. Luke’s, at the
Wentworth on Wednesday, promises to be
the great crush of next week. The other big
Darlinghurst hospital, St. Vincent’s, will
benefit by a series of beautiful tableaux
vivants at the Playhouse on the 19th.
David Jones’ Miss O’Keefe, the uncrowned
queen of fashion south of the Line, whose
fame echoes from Darwin to Invercargill,
and who has dressed every Sydney bride of
note within the last few years, has booked
for London, Paris and probably Vienna,
early next year, the idea, of course, being
for the quick brain to register the trend
of sartorial architecture in post-war Europe.
On Saturday Lute Drummond will tell
the first (Puccini’s “II Trittico”) of her
six stories of the Operas. This particular
opera was translated by her for Ricordi
for the last Covent Garden season. Jean
Drummond and Mr. Dailison will supply
musical illustrations, and the pretty Count-
ess Lalli will make her Australian stage
d6but in some .Mozart songs.
The Crown-street Women's Hospital will
net a neat sum from Ye Okie English Ball,
which transformed the Paddington Town
Hall into something that might have been
mistaken, if the hock cup had been stronger,
for a guild-hall shivoo in old London town
when gallant and foreseeing ’prentice lads
loved their masters’ daughters. The whole
of _ the ceiling was hidden by a canopy of
rainbow-hued ribbons, interlaced with gay.
bobbing balloons ; and otherwise the jazz was
like all the other fancy-dress dances of the
season, the costumes being snatched from
every period and every clime.
Gladys Owen, just departed for America,
was the largest collector of farewell food
during the week, being the guest of honor
at innumerable lunches and teas, most of
them staged at the Queen’s Club.
A postscript from Brisbane:—
Southport’s welcome to the G.-G. and Lady Forster
was royally expressed by the purple and gold among
which the vice-regal party took morning tea at the
Pacific. There followed an inspection of the site
for a bridge over Nerang Creek, a visit to the
cable station, dinner at the Grande Hotel, and a
rush in motors back to ihe Pacific, to dance under
Lord f orster’s colors, dependent from a gilt coronet,
hung there by the committee of the R. S. and S.
Imperial League. Next day their Exes. disappeared
over the border and awa’, to the plaintive piping
of “Will Ye No’ Come Back Again?”
Two Governors, Nathan and Davidson, went to
Jascha Spivakovsky’s final concert, along with an
audience that included bishops, canons and just
plain music-lovers.
The Davidson daughters have been temporarily
deposited with Mrs. William Collins, at Nindooimbah,
where the lovely roses come from.
During the week Gov. Nathan went to a dolls’
fete in the Albert Hall, and carried off a black cat
mascot, imposing enough to absorb half the luck in
Queensland.
On Sept. 5 their Exes, took the State car, and
jolted up the North Coast line to Mooloolah, Lands-
borough, Palmwoods, Maleny and Nambour. At the
Montville Methody Church a wedding was in progress
when the vice-regals arrived, and the bride, who
was changing her name from Thompson to Dunning,
proving to be a shipmate of his, Sir Matthew blessed
the happy pair with his presence. After a dinner
at Nambour, their Exes, finished up with “Scandal”
in the Town Hall. The Governors and Dame Mar-
garent concluded a crowded week by opening the
Gympie Show.
ihe Queensland Authors and Artists’ Association
hang a show of loan pictures in the United Service
Club. This democratic society scorns to have a
patron, and knows no distinctions in creed and poli-
tics; but Governor Nathan takes a fatherly and
helpful interest in it. Elocution by bright young
Queenslanders, music and song are filling the glad-
some eves till the 20th.
f reda Bage put tea tables in her garden in honor
of her mother, Mrs. Edward Bage, who is up from
and hailed her friends in the grounds of
the Women’s College. In the evening Mrs. Bage
talked of travelling in Japan at the Lyceum Club,
and showed finger-prints of the inspected places.

The

Fact of the
Superiority
in
Tone, Touch and Durability
of the
GULBRANSEN
f2suc?&encert6
PLAYER PIANO
is evidenced by the wonderful enthusiasm
shown by owners of this remarkable
instrument.
The Guibransen Duo-Concerto provides a com-
plete control over the stroke of the piano
hammer, and that is why this remarkable
player can, and does, really produce perfect
tone color, and in the hands of anyone, after
a little practice, rivals the musical performances
of the highest class of virtuosi.
Whether the piano is played by hand or by the
foot-pedals, perfection of tonal values is the
aim of every performer.
Call in and play the
Duo-Concerto for ten
minutes, and then you
will fully understand
the enthusiasm that is
shown for this Player.

necessity. It is the pen which
never needs coaxing, for its reliable feed
ensures a steady flow of ink the instant

Be Brett: You say “the present, or 12th
Duke of Hamilton,” Whitaker says the present is the
“13th D. of Hamilton (Scot.)”” You say “the Duke of
Abercorn, quite a new nobleman, because his peerage
is dated 1868,” and Whitaker makes him an earl

I was walking through the forest
At .'toon the other day,
When I came across a body
That had nearly rotted away.
’Twas the body of a woman
Of twenty years or less.
And I think she had ben murdered,
For she had not a stitch of dress.
Not far away from where 1 stood
I found a lump of lead,
With which the poor unfortunate girl
Was hit upon the head.
i could spend no more time upon the spot,.
The scent was much too strong.
So I cursed the scoundrel who had murdered
the girl,
Then I hurried along.
On entering my cabin
My eyes fell on my wife.
She was lying on the sofa,
In her heart, was stuck a knife.
I rushed to her assistance
And I laid her on the bed ;
But when I looked more closer
I discovered—she—was-—dead.
I threw my arms around her,
And I hugged and kissed her too.
My wife, my darling, had been murdered,
The slayer, my God, if I only knew!
Next day I wandered into the woods,
__ And how the time did fly.
Until to me came the horrible sound
Of a woman’s cry.
1 ran to the spot,
And there with my eye
Saw a man with no clothes
And an axe held high.
On the ground was a woman.
She lay there quite still.
So I sprang on the maniac
With the object to kill.
3 We fought a wild fight
And I killed the cad.
And the woman she kissed me.
I know she was glad.

On Mullegin’s run he was sent,
To gain Australia’s experance;

But when it came to mending his pants,
He seemed to think, and wonder how;
Then he thought of, you cows.
Of course he had to help with everything,
But little of use was he;
The girls got him to try to sing,
That suited the girls to a t,
Then with a little gracious bow,
What yer laughing at, yer cows?

Started him on Bell, they knew.

Held their breaths, you rotten cows.

EVERY housewife has certain bits of furniture with
which she will not part. They may be cherished
family heirlooms or prized for other sentimental reasons.
But now, scratched and marred, their newness crone —
they are banished to somewbere-out-of-the-way.
Bring them out. Buy a tin of Sapolin. How easy it is
to “touch them up” with Sapolin—giving them the
charm of the old and the joy of the new!
Sapolin comes in a number of finishes and colours. It is
easy to apply —full directions on every tin. Works well
even in torrid climates.

Mr. Norman Lee Praises
Rexona Shaving Soap.
Mr. Norman Lee, who is now appearing
as The Dude in “The Peep Show,” at the
Theatre Royal, Sydney, is a strong advocate
of Rexona Shaving Soap, and writes us as
follows: —
“I have enjoyed shaving with
Rexona Shaving Soap so much that
I have decided to drop you a line
telling you how much I like it. lam
very particular in regard to the kind
of Shaving Soap 1 use, and I have
found Rexona Shaving Soap to
exactly suit me.
“It lathers freely, and makes shav-
ing a delight. I think the triangular
stick quite a novelty, and 1 am sure
I get a lot more shaves out of the
Rexona Stick than any other I have
ever tried.
“Good luck to Rexona Shaving
Soap.
“Yours very truly,
“(Sgd.) NORMAN LEE.”

NORMAN LEli
(from a photo').
There’s Comfort in a
Rexona Shave.
Kexona Shaving Soap niak«n for comfort and hygiene in shaving, and tempers
the skin against wind and had weather. It produces a thick, creuiny lather, which
softens (he beard and makes shaving a pleasure. It is delicately perfumed and
medicated on the same principles as Rexona, and not only produces a lasting lather,
but purities and leaves the skin in perfect condition.
Heing -sii antiseptic Medicated Soap, it has a tendency to quickly heal am.v cut
you may have the misfortune to get, and if troubled with pimples or blottshes of
any kind, will daily tend to improve them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE moon goes slowly towards the west,
Behind the gums and pines;
The nor’-east breeze has gone to rest,
And at her mooring lines
Our boat is swaying with the tide
That, restless evermore,
Creeps in and out and round about
Grey rock and gleaming shore.
Pale lights are shining on far hills,
With roof and garden crowned;
The night is thick with dew that chills
The stirless air around;
A stillness, more of death than life,
Broods over wave and tree,
And on the tide, from side to side,
Our boat sways drowsily.
More like to sounds that one may hear
When death his forehead pales,
A mopoke mutters, lone and drear,
A lonely curlew wails —
Wails once—from some gloom-shrouded
haunt,
Dark creek or ghostly dune;
And breathing low with pulses slow
Earth sleeps beneath the moon.
Earth sleeps, and by kind dreams withdrawn
From thoughts of toil that tire,
A fisherman, who waits the dawn,
Lies sleeping by his fire;
Head couched on arm and limbs outstretched,
He sleeps, and nothing heeds —
Not empty net, nor vain regret,
Nor grim to-morrow’s needs.
From far-off reefs slow-breaking seas
Send forth a solemn call,
And in among the stirless trees
Dark shadows creep and crawl.
Rock-faces stare, and all around
Weird witchery is rife —
Things born of dream that make us seem
More kin to death than life.
The moon has sunken in the west,
Behind the pines and gums;
The dawn-sent wind, no more at rest,
With life and motion comes;
Oiir boat is dancing on the tide,
That, busy evermore,
Glides in and out, and round about
Lit rock and shining shore.

to show a little too much longitude and a
marked brevity of latitude, considered as an
athlete, but appearances are proverbially de-
ceptive, and although Lee looked spare in
his neat suit of dark grey tweed and an
excess of ironed white collar, stripped one
had only to take a glance at the broad deep
torso, with ample engine space, and rippling
with muscle like a bag of pups, to realise
that here was a man with whom it were well
to sustain friendly relations. Yet later, when
a mild disturbance arose over the blind
efforts of a cheerful inebriate to kiss Miss
Butternut’s dimple, Steve kept well in the
background, and left it to Eva’s brother to
tumble the transgressor into the right-of-
way.
“Why not have passed him a jab on his
way out?” said Nickie, who had just been
made acquainted with Stephen Lee. Lee
shook his cropped head emphatically.
“Nothin’ of the like,” he said. “Can’t be
done. Unprofessional, son.”
“But because you’re a pug it don’t follow
yer goin’ to allow every swindler to step
on yer face.”
“Oh, a lad does a duck,” said Ironbark.
“When fightin’s a man’s game, he don’t
want none such out of business hours. It’s
all very well for them that ain’t in the ring
to go waggin’ a mit in the face of every
hard-hitter what looks contrary to ’em, but
the professional gent fights when he’s got
to, and for his professional fees. Besides
it ain’t upholdin’ the dignity of the game
for a sport to be seen carryin’ round an eye
like a battered passion-fruit what he’s picked
up casual in the street from some rough-an’-
ready with a hand like an elephant’s foot.”
“S’pose yer right,” said Nickie. “Come
and have a”
Ironbark put up a hand, and wagged his
head. “Nothin’ but water diluted with
ice,” he said. “I’m little brother to a
Pussyfoot.’
“What, not a teetote?” said Nickie, dis-
gust in his tone.
Non-drinker, non-smoker, pickles barred,
and pastry strickly forbid. Thev’ve signed
me on with Pibroch, the Pride of Port Pirie
a lad upwards of 16st., what’s been jugglin’
with slugs of silver up there till he’s
got a punch to shatter granite. It’s in the
nature of a try-out for the Pride but I °-et
a hundred and fifty if I wind him up inside
20 rounds. If he puts me in the blanket
he is to have a cut at a couple of the better
heavies, but I ain t drenmin’ of bein’ pasted
on the wall by a fat slouch from the dark
interior, and I’m backin’ myself to ! win
another hundred fifty. I’m goin’ fer me life
anyhow; I want that money for the ’appy
’ome.”
“Yer last scrap?” said Nicholas Don.
“Eva says it’s got to be,” Ironbark con-
fided, “and I reckon that what she says is
to was has got to be.”
“Fine, upstanding good-looker that,” said
Nickie, feeling called upon to say something
polite.
“Isn’t she but?” Ironbark’s eyes were full
of gratitude. "Do you think it a bare pos.
that any man fightin’ for her could get it all
across him?”
“Not imaginable, Ned.”
Steve took Nickie’s hand, and shook it
warmly. "My sentiments,” he said. “After
lickin’ Pibroch I retire with dig.”
“And yer blushin’ honors thick upon
you,” said Nicholas, quoting the sporting
writers.
“That’s so, and thereafter Ironbark Lee’s
a shoofer of sober habits and genteel be-
havior. She sez so.”
“And good luck to both of you.”
The ingenuous prize-fighter shook Nickie’s
hand again with some effusion. “I like
you,” said he. “Of course you don’t know
how to handle ’em.”
“Oh, in a modest way. I done a bit.”
“Well, look here. You might look in at
the stable now and again, and le’ me get
out after you with the pillows. I’m short
of sparrin’ partners.”
Nicholas Don flushed with pride. Spar-
ring partner to Ironbark Lee, a boxer
puttin’ ’em up to the best on the board!
,What a standing it would give a man.
“ ’Struth, I’d give an ear to,” said he.
“Good enough. Show up at the den,
Hoclfie’s, under the fish joint, Elizabeth-
street. There’s always somethin’ doin’.
Look in any time, and we’ll ding a dong or
two. It’ll do you sood.”
You would imagine from Nicholas Don’s
expressions of pleasure that he regarded with
keen delight the prospect of being battered
about in a 16ft. ring by a pugilist of Mr.
Lee’s engaging appearance and polished man-
ners.
“I don’t engender grease, as you see,”
Nickie gave Ironbark a fair view of his
spare proportions, “and the game keeps a
man pretty fit. I’m jugglin’ bags iv wheat
for liodgkinson, and handlin’ four Clydes-
dales with hairy feet like pile-drivers, so I
ain’t so soft that I’d be stunned by the kick
of a duck.”
Ironbark’s attitude was one of approval.
“I like yer lines,” he said, “and if yer pert
with yer paws we might get you a fight one
o’ them days.”
“What, me a professional!” Nickie shook
his head. “Too partial to me beer, too
wedded to ciggers, too touchy about the set
of me nose and the trimness o’ me ear.”
“Well, look at me,” said Lee. “I ain’t
such a battered relic, am I? And I’ve been
nine years in the game.”
“Look as if you might have been head
waiter in a beauty parlor,” Nickie agreed.
“I couldn’t believe my earsight when it’s
sprung on me you are Ironbark Lee and a
middleweight champion.”
Mr. Nicholas Don was not called upon
to strain a point in his praise of Stephen
Lee. Steve offered every physical excuse for
the affection with which Miss Butternut re-
garded him. There was a faint suggestion
of thickness in the left ear, and the cheek
just under the eye was somewhat calloused
to afford protection to the organs of vision,
a remarkable instance of adaptation, but
otherwise Mr. Lee could have been a young
clergyman for all the traces the game had
left upon him. True, any such delusion must
have been dispersed the moment he opened
his mouth, but Ironbark’s manner was quiet,
almost gentle, his tone was propitiatory, his
eyes were a kindly blue-grey, and his smile
was full of the whitest and shiniest of teeth.
No wonder Miss Eva had selected him out
of several very eligible young men who had
thrown out signals, for Eva was a nice-look-
ing girl, and had had, and might be expected
to have, great opportunities. She had
accepted Steve, although she detested prize-
fighting, because he was good to his mother,
freighted with a big heart, and easily the
handsomest. cleanest, straightest, most
gentlemanly-looking boy of her acquaintance.
“I’m taken on to spar a few turns with
Steve,” said Nickie to the girl hanging on
Ironbark’s shoulder later that night. “That
sort of makes 11s related.”
“Oh, I hate all that.” Eva replied.
“Nice, clean way of pickin’ up the quids,”
Nickie replied.
“That’s what I’m telling her,” Steve put
in. “If it hadn’t been for the game she’d
never have looked my way; I’d have been
still a smith tinkering meters fer the gas co.,
black as yer hat. with never the price of
a decent frolic. Now. I’ve got a dinkie little
villa of me own, anyway: this next scrap
will give me three hundred to the good,
which’ll leave a bit over when the weddin’
breakfast is financed and the parson paid
off.”
Eva shook her head, laughing. “You’ve
promised,” she said.
“And me word’s me dead oath,” replied
Steve. “All the same” He had a trick
of not finishing his sentences.
Nickie felt a benevolent glow suffusing
him as he looked on the neat couple smiling
into each other’s eyes. It delighted his
romantic sensibilities to know that he was
to be in a measure a minor agent to their
ultimate happiness. “Well, for once,” said
he, “that fat feller Cupid drops bow and
arrows and put on the mits. His nibs here
will moD up this slouch from Port Pirie.
then you’re for the Blue Mountains, and I
reckon it’ll be up to you to keep Steve’s last
pair of boxing-gloves under a glass dome on
the parlor-table for the rest of yer days.”
Nickie said nothing to the lads at the
mill about his engagement as sparring part-
ner to Ironbark Lee till he realised his ambi-
tion, and had actually stood up to the cham-
pion for three rounds. Then he felt justified
in inflating his chest a trifle and talking
boxing with the air of one on the inside.
In fact. Mr. Don shaped very well. His
footwork filled Ironbark with admiration.
“It’s like tryin’ to hit a flea in a fit.”
said Steve. “If I can land them on you
I ought to be able to spatter ’em all over
the ponderous object from Port Pirie.”
“Too slow, is he?” asked Nickie.

SPRING ERUPTIONS
QUICKLY CURED BY EAM-BUK.
“For eruptions and skin
troubles caused by changes of
temperature I find Zam-Buk
splendid,” writes Mrs. E. Parker,
of 1 1 9 George Street, Parramatta,
Sydney. “I also suffered from
eczema, with its irritating, burn-
ing sensations. Zam-Buk was
most soothing and cooling when
applied to this complaint, and
quickly eased the terrible itching.
“We have also found Zam-Buk
unequalled for cuts, burns,
sprains, and other accidents met
with in the home.”

your skin clear and healthy. This rare herbal balm sinks
into and purifies the inner tissues, and acts as a tonic for the
sluggish skin, which it frees from all blemishes.
To all who have a tendency to skin trouble of any sort,
a daily dressing of Zam-Buk is of the utmost benefit.
Avoid common soaps. Zam-Buk Medicinal Soap is a
splendid aid in dispelling Spring skin eruptions.
No mere fatty ointment or salve can possibly do your
skin the same good as this pure and highly-refined Zam-
Buk. It is the World’s Greatest Skin-Cure, ever-ready and
ever-reliable.

“Well, I’m tellin’ you I don’t know the
lad. But word comes through that he relies
on bein’ a tough hulk with the fat punch.
I’ve never seen him, and they are takin par-
ticular good care I shan’t till the moment
when we get together in the ring at the
Stadium. His friends make a sort of dark
horse of him, and are training him some-
where in the bush far from beer, which is
his besettin’ sin. I’m told. He sounds ever
so easy to me.”
"I hope you ain’t deceived in the cow.”
“Let us pray,” sighed Steve. “I’d hate
to go home to Eva with my face put back
and my jaw in a sling.”
“I wouldn’t worry.”
“Nor me, but it bein’ my last, and so
much dependin’ on it, I do sort of attach
importance. If I lose it pushes our wedding
on a year, perhaps more. The ’appy ’ome’s
partly furnished, but you can’t marry on a
saddle-back soot and a few saucepans. Why.
niy login’ this fight might mean losin’ that
girl. 1 ain’t never too cocksure of her. She’s
a cut above. Might change her mind any
mo.”
The thought infused Ironbark with a sort
"f fury ; lie waded in, and in a minute had
Nickie all in a crumpled heap iu one corner
of the ring. _ But the time came when Iron-
bark couldn’t do that, and when Nicholas
Don ceased to regard the possibility- of his
taking professional status as altogether too
far fetched.
"M ho knows,” he said to the men at the
mill in. moments between the tossing of 2001 b.
bags of Hour. "I may be tempted to chuck
all this and become a genteel champion. It
took Ironbark five rounds of hard trying to
put that dot on me last night”—Nickie
pointed with pride to a slight blackening of
bis left eye—“and Ironbark Lee can outbox
anything his heftage in Australia.”
As a result of Nickie’s enthusiasm, the
mill was all for Ironbark Lee, and the sports
were putting by spare ends of their wages
to back Steve at a distance, the odds being
longer that way. Nickie had already placed
a couple of pounds at two to one with a
fat Israelite who knew something about Pib-
roch of Port Pirie.
“I fanthy the big fellei'. bein’ a Tliscotcli-
man methelf,” said the bookie.
Time passed, as time will. They were
within a few days of the match, and now
Nicholas Don was an expert boxer, and de-
termined, at any rate, to have a cut for
the anpiteur championship when the A.A.A.
contests came along. He had picked up a
few acquaintances about the stable, and on
the Friday evening, just 24 hours previous
to the grand slam, as he called it, Nickie
was in the Golden Globe Hotel bar, taking
some slight refreshment from a long glass.
Nickie had a liking for the brown-haired bar-
maid at the Golden Globe, a relative of the
house, as she was careful to explain, and
no pump-hand from necessity. She insisted
on regarding Nicholas as a pugilist of some
eminence, and would introduce him as
“NickD Don, you know, the well-known
boxer. He’s working with Ironbark Lee
just now, but one of these days he’s going
to sten up and astonish creation; aren’t you,
son? What did you say you were having?”
“If I didn’t know you were a friend of
mine I’d think you were tugging my leg,”
Nickie would reply in a deprecatory tone.
"I’m just flourishin’ them iu a friendly way
with old Ironbark.”
"Oh, I hear what’s happening in the
stable,” continued the Hebe with a proud
glance. “The lads come in here, and they
will talk. What’s this about you having
Steve Lee down twice in a round?”
"Luck of the game,” said Nickie. “Luck
of the game.” lie saw the other men in
the bar were impressed, and a surge of grati-
fied vanitj- prickled all his being. Perhaps
be would show them one of these days.
A few minutes later, while Nickie was
making amorous play with llebe, a bull-
headed man banged into the bar, sending
the swing doors crashing against the wall
with tlu> impetuosity of his plunge. The
man was big and heavy. NicKie. who had
cultivated, the seeing eye in this respect,
noticed his enormous chest and the more
important fact that from his lumbering
shoulders bis arms swung so short as to
seem a little deformed and quite ludicrous.
“(Wouldn’t swipe anythin’ that wasn’t within
18 inches of that Dutch oven of his,” was
Nickie’s silent comment. Aloud he said:—
"What is it come in? A trnmear or a
hungry hippo?”
The man stood, scowling, inviting adverse
opinion ; then he strode up. swept Mr. Don’s
beer off the counter to the floor, and said :
"Miss. I’ll take gin and ginger-beer, an’
look dam’ quick about it.”
The girl served him. ami lie took her hand.
“A tidy skirt,” he said, and drew her towards
him. “Give’s a kiss, old dear.”
Hebe resisted. "Behave vourself!” she
said indignantly.
“Behave meself? Cert., I will. This is
how.” He dragged at her. and succeeded in
placing a kiss on her left ear. Meanwhile
Mr. Nicholas Don was digging an imperious
forefinger into the big fellow’s arm com-
manding attention. When the digging grew
painful, the Hippo turned with a grunt and
scowled horribly upon the slim youth.
“You ain’t looking fer an early death.”
said he.
Nickie beat his empty glass upon the
counter. “You failed to notice you spilt my
beer,” he said gently. “Naturally, you are
goin’ to fill it up again, good Mr. Hippo.”
“I’m goin’ to split yer face if you flirt
with me,” replied the big chap.
“But a feller’s beer!” protested Nickie.
“It ain’t square the dink to go spillin’ a
man’s beer and refusin’ compensation. Beer
is a delicate subject. Miss Cummins, you’ll
give me another glass, please, at the expense
of the Hippo.”
But the man still held Hebe, so Nicholas,
to hasten matters, rapped the huge one on
the biceps with the bottom of the heavy
tumbler. With a hog-like snort the stranger
turned from Hebe, and hinged at Nickie.
The blow was not within eight inches of reach-
ing its mark, and the big fellow, following it
up rushed Nickie, and mauled him in a
corner.
“A fumblin’ fighter.” thought Nickie. “and
muscle-bound at that.” ID ducked and
broke ground, taking the middle of the bar-
floor, where the enemy rushed again and met
a straight left that propped him in the nose
with a lick that felt like a jab with the
end of a big stick.
Blood sprang from the blow, and the
large man broke into a flood of language,
and strove to weave in, but Nic-kie gave
ground, getting in another straight left and
the mugs follow, which landed on the ear
of the Hippo, causing him to shake his big
head. There followed a series of furious
rushes on the part of the Hippo, every one
of which was stopped with a monotonous,
shooting left. Meanwhile, the absurd short
arms of the aggressor beat the air like the
flukes of a stranded whale. Then came an
opening as wide as a church door. N.ekie
stepped in, delivered a left hook to the right
side of the chin and a swinging right to the
left side, and down went Hippo, crashing
into a form that smashed under him, and
whacking his head on the wall in a way
that did him no good in the world.
Nickie stood looking down at the outed
Hippo, when Hebe plucked at his elbow'.
“Quick, lad, behind the counter, and into
the cellar. Here are the Johns.”
Nickie vaulted the counter and ducked,
llebe threw his coat after him, and our
hero lay low in the cellar, while two con-
stables gathered up the fallen man, hoisted
him into a cab, and removed him for medical
investigation at the handiest hospital. The
police were told that Hippo had injured
himself plungiug about while under the influ-
ence of gin and ginger. Nickie went home.
Next day, being Saturday, Mr. Nicholas
Don called at Butternut’s in the course of
the afternoon to keep a date with Ironbark.
He found poor Steve clamped to a chair,
wearing the gloomy cast of a man who has
just lost an affectionate aunt. To Nickie’s
amazement he was making a big meal of
grilled kidneys.
“What!” gasped Don, “surely that ain’t
the regulation menoo?”
“It don’t matter a dam’,” growled Iron-
bark. “if I eat a bloomin’ horse. All’s off.
Eva’s in the bedroom, cryin’ her eyes up,
and I’m feelin’ I’d like to murder me own
grandfather.”
"All off?” cried Nickie.
“All O double F, off.” Ironbark rose to ibis
feet, and beating his indurated fist on the
table top, said, with a ferocity utterly
foreign to Nickie’s conception of him : “If I
could have just 10 minutes with the meddlin’
swine that done it I could give up with
happiness.”
“The swine what done what?”
“The swine that crooled to-night’s fight.
It’s all off, I tell you. Some flash Harry
got. to the Pride of Port Pirie on Friday in
a city bar, and simply broke him all up. He
got two cracked ribs, a concussion, and a
blighted haemorrhage (whatever that” may
bet and the fight’s off for ever. I’m broke,
and me marriage is postponed, and I don’t
want anyone to worry me with words, ’cause
I’m full of murder.”
Mr. Nicholas Don turned round, and went
home. His sudden suspicion was all too
true, to fact. The Hippo he had smashed
out in Hebe’s bar was actually Pibroch, the
pride and champion of Port Pirie, tem-
porarily escaped from his keepers.
EDWARD DYSON.
Bush Atmosphere.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rri HE dinner-party had been a great
success.
"I love your home, Janey.” Mrs.
Parsons leaned back in her chair. “It has
a witchery to us jaded city-folk.”
Janey smiled. The dining-room was full
of the scents of the party—especially the
scent of roses and the mellow smell of rock-
melons which had been picked in the gar-
den just off the verandah.
“What a perfectly heavenly fragrance
your room has, Mrs. Atkins,” said Mary
Lee. “Itock-melons and roses. I love the
combination.”
“And cigars,” gushed Miss Parsons. “D 0
smoke, men. I)o you mind, Mrs. Atkins—
Janey? I’m crazy about the smell of cigars
—so man-like—so thrilling.”
The smoke of the Havanas mixed frag-
rantly with the scent of the roses, the freshly-
rubbed odor of the furniture-cream which
Mrs. Atkins had used that day—the scent of
eau-de-Cologne, soft silks and satins and
rock-melons. Every now and then, from
the bush without, another scent blew in,
wild, strange, unfamiliar.
“What is that bush smell?” asked
Mary Lee, as she lifted her hands from the
piano. “Pungent, isn’t it?—like leaves and
dust and sunlight and leather all mixed
together.”
“Urn. It is peculiar,” said one of the
men. “Rock-melons and roses, eau-de-
Cologne and lavender water combined with
the smell of earth. I think it’s the bush
fragrance mingling with the intoxicating
scents of this room.”
The ladies laughed.
“Sing something, Mary, please. Ah! do."
Mary sang “Down in the Forest Some-
thing Stirred.”
“How well you sing still, dear!” said Mrs.
Parsons. “That smell. Isn’t it strong;
Almost as if something were burning.”
They all tilted their noses delicately,
daintily and drew in the unfamiliar odor.
“Oh, it’s only the rock-melons, I think,"
said someone. “And these roses, pink and
puffy and sweet.”
The men walked out on the wide verandah
and the ladies followed them.
“It is a strange smell, eucalypty, wattly
but nasty too. Isn’t it?”
They all paused for a second while rock-
melons, cigars, roses, silks, satins, lavender
water, eau-de-Cologne and dust poured out
their perfumes and scents and odors about
them.
“What on earth is that bush smell?”
asked Mary Lee irritably. “I can’t place
it.”
“Coo-ee! Coo-ee! Mr. Atkins ! Mr.
Atkins! Are you there? Quick! Quick!”
They heard the rushing of a horse, panting
horribly, and a voice from the darkness.
“Oh, come quickly, Mr. Atkins! Mr.
Atkins! Charley’s lubra’s been speared
and the blacks are trying to burn the body.
Come quickly, quickly !”
