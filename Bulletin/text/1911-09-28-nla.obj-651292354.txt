THE RED PAGE
The Innocence of Father Brown —G. K.
Chesterton ( Sydney Book Club). The
fat little priest of these stories is some-
thing new in the detective line. Though
Chesterton does not play the unravel-
ling game any more fairly than Maurice
Leblanc in some of the Arsbne Lupin
series, this book is full of good ideas
and worth reading. For the first time, de-
tective stories are used as a medium for
religious propaganda.
The Missing Finger —-Albert Boissi&re
(Dodd, Mead and Co., per Angus and
Robertson). A clever mystery stoi-y,
although it depends upon the good old
twins who cannot be distinguished
apart.
The Skipper and the Skipped— Holman Day
(E. W. Cole). There is an abundance
of American humor in this “shore log of
Cap’n Aaron Sproul.”
The Land of Veiled Women —J. Foster
Fraser (Cassell and Co.). The pictur-
esque aspects of life in Algeria, Tunisia
and Morocco have been skimmed in ex-
cellent fashion for the casual l-eader,
to whom accuracy is of little moment.
F.F. is a smart journalist, and knows
how to hit the public with bright stuff
at the -right time.
THE QUEST.
I have followed her ever—
From boyhood’s tangled wilderness
Or fairy tale and wondrous story,
Where I touched the hem of her dress,
Once—when the white-winged glory
Of a great star hung a-quiver
O’er the midnight river—
O’er a blurred white face in the river,
And I felt the silence shiver
As she passed me —whispering.
I followed her onward ever
To the realm of madness and fire,
To the kingdom of parched desire,
Where I was king.
And I heard the silence sing
When my lips—tor a moment —were swept
by her hair,
Blown like sunshine everywhere
About an awe-struck world ;
But, alas! for longing my heart was dumb,
For very passion my arms were numb;
And she glanced—and left me there.
But I followed her still for ever,
Through manhood’s thronging years
Of phantom loves and unwept tears,
And the anguished scarlet of lips defiled,
That could not pray—yet smiled,
Till I found a trace
Once more of her grace
In the beautiful face
Of my child.
I shall follow her onward for ever
Through the great white gates of death —-
To her luminous palace of death ;
And, when I find her,
Mv passion shall mnd her,
Heart to heart—breath to breath—
Fierce kisses shall blind her
Blue eyes to all ruth
For the fatherless child, and (h. wiuowed
wife,
And the wasted life,
That was wasted—for Truth.

Hans Heysen: A Great Water-
Color Painter
Hans Heysen is in more than one respect
the most remarkable landscape painter in
Australia. -He is probably the only artist on
this great continent who neither lives by
journalism nor by teaching. It seems to
me, something astounding that an artist
should live by his art in Australia, should
paint exactly what he likes —-and Sell it.
Yet Heysen has two years’ commissions
ahead of him. ,
It is a pleasure to think that merit can
be so equitably rewarded. The only reasons
I caii adduce for the phenomenon are that
his art is noble, sincere and intimately Aus-
tralian, that Melbourne possesses art-
patrons of taste and discrimination, and
that he is one of the most brilliant water-
colorists living.
* * * *
Heysen was born in Hamburg, Germany,
in 1878, and came to Australia with his
parents at the age of seven. His father took
up a selection outside Adelaide, and knew all
the ups and downs —particularly the downs
—connected with “the land,” and the boy, to
assist his parents financially, drove a cart,
and worked for some time in an ironmongery
store. He was 15 when his first interest in
art awakened. A lithograph of some white
swans throwing their reflection into very
blue water seemed to him both beautiful and
delectable, and, his mother assisting, he con-
structed a first palette of Prussian blue,
chrome yellow, brown and white. The re-
sult can be imagined easily. From thence
the fascination of color possessed the boy.
His only opportunities were on Sundays, and
he was always up before dawn, with tucker
enough for the day, and away to the hills.
His work was careful, a kind of indiscrim-
inate pre-raphaelitism, but it gradually im-
proved under the tuition of Mr. Gill, at the
School of Design, where he worked at night.
Some sketches offered modestly for sale at a
dealer’s shop sold at once, and the young
painter established a market. He was soon
doing so well that four Adelaide gentlemen
thought him likely to spoil his hand, so they
put their purses together and sent him to
Europe, with the proviso that he was to re-
tain his sketches, but that his finished work
should go to them. Heysen put in four
years abroad, studying hard. He worked
first at Julien’s, Paris, under Jean Paul
Laurens and Benjamin Constant, after-
wards at Beaux Arts under Bonnat. His
evenings were spent at Callarrossi’s, Where
Prenet, Colin and Tournes criticised. He
spent all this time drawing from the figure,
and only painted in the summer months,
which were spent in Scotland, Holland, Eng-
land and Italy. Of all the provincial
Italian art centres where he worked, Heysen
found Florence the most interesting. To-
wards the end of 1903 he returned to Aus-
tralia. The Sydney, Melbourne and Ade-
laide Galleries acquired pictures by him, and
he established himself at Ilahndorf, the little
German village near Adelaide, where he finds
the life simple, and the big gums his truest
source of inspiration. His main support
has come from Melbourne, and his chief big
“imperial” sized watercolors have been ac-
quired by Sir Thomas Gibson Carmichael,
Professor Baldwin Spencer, Mr. Walter
Schmidt and Madame Melba.
Since lie returned from Europe, Heysen
has been fascinated with the painting of
Australian light. In all his letters to me
the subject recurs. Referring to a large
water-color he was recently at work on. he
writes: “I am trying to get into it all the
HANS HEYSEN.
light and heat I can, raising it some degrees
higher in key than my Sydney water-color.
But to give expression fo that intangible
stuff, light and atmosphere, is indeed a
problem, yet I feel these to be the essence
of Australian Landscape! And they are
what make nature so various and fascinat-
ing here. Sunshine above all is the essence
of life —and air and atmosphere close on its
heels. To give these with an arrangement of
beautiful and truthful forms, should make
beautiful pictures. Ah, well, we can only
have a try, but it’s fine to dream about it.”
On seeing his water-color in the Mel-
bourne Gallery last November, he wrote:
“I was very disappointed—-in fact, I could
hardly believe my eyes—the whole drawing
seemed so devoid of light, the very thing I
had always thought it gave an impi-ession
of. I hope I have got past this stage for
ever.”
Writing of another work —“Timber Haul-
ing’’—which was recently acquired by the
Sydney Gallery, he says : “I think it nqw
contains more serial color, at the same time
retaining a certain bigness of form. I find
the great problem is to keep, the same bal-
ance between these two. To aim at the
vibi’ation of light generally means destroying
the dignity of a picture. You may take
nearly any one of even the biggest impres-
sionists —Sisley, Monet, Pissarro, and in
isolated pictures only have they retained
nature’s dignity or the deeper character of
forms. Judging by reproductions of Monet’s
latest works, I seem to feel he is coming
back to the above point of view. In looking
at a picture one wants to see and feel
nature first —not method It requires
more than a correct portrayal of forms to
paint a country. The heart must be there.
Without feeling how can a work be con-
vincing?”
I have collated these passages from Hey-
sen’s letters carefully, because they contain
the whole of his aesthetic. He has swallowed
tradition wholesale—Poussin, Millet, Turner.
He has served an apprenticeship to the ana-
lytical methods of the impressionists-—he
has an extraordinary knowledge of the re-
action of colors, and upon this double foun-
dation his art has developed. His fine
powers of observation and love of nature
have freed him frpm both eclecticism and
science, and his work is to-day characteris-
tic and original, as sincere and dignified as
the man himself. To have seen the beautiful
set of water-colors recently exhibited by
Heysen at the R.A.S., Sydney, was to know
that though Manet was right when he said
that the principal person in a picture was
the light, yet that without emotional com-
munication nothing counts. These “Hymns
tq the Sun” —offerings of a devout Apol-
lonian —were charged with emotional beauty,
the splendor of the technique had but accen-
tuated the splendor of the painter’s vision.
For Hans Heysen is not only master of a
very difficult medium, he is, in my opinion,
a very great artist, and to know the man,
straightforward and sincere, content with
his bread and his art, is to account—if ever
genius can be accounted for—in part at
least for the nobility and \sweetness of his
work.
LIONEL LINSAY.
Short Circuit
From the wide and open marble upper ter-
race of the Hotel of the Stairs of Iron
they looked down upon the hotel garden—
once the ramparts of a fort which dominated
the Bay of Cagliari ere the Mediterranean
retreated from the Capital of Sardinia and
left the fort as a steep rock marooned half a
mile inland. And on the dock a century
ago they builded the Albergo della Scali di
Ferro.
The scents of the garden ascended to the
man and woman oh the terrace 50 feet above
the trees—magnolia, gardenia, oleander,
frangipanni; the moon rose out of Italy
saturating the air with light, falling in a
shower upon the statue of the Verrochio boy
clasping the struggling dolphin that spouted
a stream of tinkling silver to the fountain
basin. And south there were but the rid-
ing lights of' ships and the place where the
tunny fishers go, and the quiet breathing of
the sea that was like moon-blur and shadow,
and lastly, and invisible, the coast of Africa.
It was all beautiful and quiet and elo-
quent of scented rest; that quietness that
asks only Love —even the fraudulent imita-
tion of Love—to make it electric.
The woman had the face of a pretty and
clever child—small-nosed, small-mouthed,
large-eyed, full with laughter; skin as if she
had been to honey and roses for tints.
The man doesn’t matter—he was ordinary
type: Say, Long Primer, Elephant Expanded
—by which a printer' would understand that
he was fairly tall and more than a little
over-stout.
A white peacock came spreading his tail
and holding hign his crest —saw that the
chairs Were very* close together—and van-
ished around the corner of the loggia again,
and became a ghost in the shadow.
Sex seemed to become more and more an
accumulator of the electric currents of the
night; the aggregation of the noises of in-
sects, of distant music and, of the tinkling
fountain basin made the air give out the
humming sounds of a great dynamo.
“You know quite a deal about poetry,”
murmured the woman, as if more than mere
poetry obsessed her and made her almost
tongue-tied.
“I know more about electrics,” laughed
the* man, more at his ease, but yet affected
by the fulness of the night and the proximity
of the woman,
“There has to be imagination in that,
too, hasn’t there?”
He laughed. “Yes! I suppose that even
a bricklayer of imagination would lay bricks
better than a dull man of the same trade.”
“But laws govern that more than they do
poetry.”
"No, I think not —isn’t it an axiom that
poetry is the exquisite expression of an ex-
quisite impression? And that’s a law.”
“And what is the base of the law of
bricklaying?”
“I don’t know —to lay the brick squarely
and not be sloppy with the mortar, I sup-
pose. And of electrics? Well, I suppose C
equals E over R.”
What does that cryptic sentence mean?”
“It means that Current equals electro
motor force divided by the Resistance.”
“You’re beyond my depth, now. By the
way, isn’t is strange that nobody ever ad-
dresses you as Nox-man Strong, Esq., or Mr.
Strong, but just Norman Strong?”
“A habit not worth speculating on, is it?”
“Of course, these Italians address you as
Ingegnei’e Illustrissimo.”
Illustrious Engineer! But I don’t think
they mean it.”
“I’m sure they do. You are illustrious.”
“I would like you to think me so.” She
laughed nervously.
“Now, you mustn’t hold my hand. . . .
Look at the beauty of the night—the air
saturated with light.”
“The moon-rays like a sea drowning the
air.”
“It seems too beautiful to breathe.”
“Yes. ... What are they playing on the
Marina? Chopin’s Mai-che Funebre? Beau-
tiful.”
“I don’t care a great deal for it. The
first movement of it is natural, but aboriginal
—aboriginal enough to be Irish, and the
second is almost.-machine-made.”
“Yes —a little trivial! I can’t disagree
with anything you say to-night. ... Oh!
really don’t hold my hand. I meant to cool
it on the balustrade. . . . How cold marble
is.”
“But marble is only a form of limestone,
and in all limestone there is fire.”
“How?”
“Burn it—mix it with water, and it con-
sumes itself with heat.”
“Now we’re becoming too chemical.”
“All processes are matters of chemistry
—even love.”
“Love ? . . . Oh! let us get back to poetry.
.. . Now! Please! O^i! don’t hold my
hand. . . . Do you like Swinburne?”
“Yes.”
“I’m so glad. So do I. What do yon
most like of his?”
“So we kissed beneath the pale, cold moon.
Ah, God! Ah, God! that day should come
so soon.”
“I don’t like that so much—it seems too
gross, too fleshy.”
"Call not anything I have created common
or unclean.” ,
“Oh! I know I can’t argue with you. I’m
not clever enough.”
“There’s a little curl fallen on your neck.”
“Thank you ; I’ll put it up.”
“No, no, don’t; I tike it so.”
“Why? For what?”
“For that.”
“Oh —-please-—someone might have seen
you kiss my neck.”
“No —only the peacock.”
“He’s gone away shocked. You know
you’re right about Chopin. He is trivial.”
“For dignity in grief, majesty in sorrow,
there are only Beethoven and Handel.”
Yes, “Ombra mai fu’ is a heartbreak, but
dignified.”
“You can’t imagine Handel cxying himself
into a red nose even if all his family died.
But a,s to Swinburne.”
“Oh ! The Spring Song; you know it?”
“I know I love you.”
“Oh ! S-s-h. Ah ! don’t —don’t kiss me
so. . . . Ah, don’t make me afraid of you.
. . . You know the beautiful Spring Song?
Now. Ah! Don’t kiss me. I thought you
were a gentleman. ... Oh! Do behave!
I’ll hold your hands'... Yes, dear I know,
but cruel to be kind Listen, dear boy-
listen —The Spring Song.”
“And a bird overhead sang ‘follow.’ ”
"Ah! Don’t kiss me so. lam faint.”
“... .And a bird to the right sang ‘here .’”
“All! Do not torture me.”
“And the arch of the leaves was hollow.”
“Oh! Be good, be nice.”
“And the meaning of Spring was clear.”
“Ah! My God! Norman you must be
mad.” .. j ,
The moonlight seemed to crash upon them
in billows of making and breaking light;
the white peacock blushed in the shadow of
the tamarisks.
Current equals electro motor force di*
yided by the resistance.
RANDOPH BEDFORD.
E. Dyson : It has come. Ever since I
gulped a full dose of O. Henry, which hap-
pened only a little time before the death of
the excellent American, I have been waiting
for the accusation, and “J.E.” gets it in—B..
Sept. 14. I am a disciple of the grower of
“Cabhages and Kings.” The fact dawned
upon me when I first read O. Henry, that,
for 15 years at least, I had been imitating
him by a process of unconscious cerebration.
My tricks, wiles and devices were all cribbed
from 0. Henry some years before his first
public appearance. I recognised them at
every turn in “The Four Million.” “Factory
’Ands” and “Benno” are fill of proofs of
crime such as my pleasant critic has picked
from “An Ornament of the Bar.” As for
Rex Beach, I have never read him, and shall
do so with the utmost apprehension, dreading
to have to further incriminate myself as one
in possession of literary property reasonably
supposed to have been stolen.

The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Cur-
rent English, adapted by H. W. and F. G.
Fowler from the great Oxford Dictionary 90
far as the latter is completed, is the best bf
small dictionaries yet issued. Common words
receive more space than usual, their shades
of meaning being given with illustrative sen-
tences ; and the spelling is consistent with
usage. Colloquial terms have been admitted,
and a few words of Australian origin such
as “larrikin” (which has passed into general
use, and appeared recently in Belloc’s The
Girondin ), “coo-ee” and “gunyah.” In a
few cases, sueh as “squatter,” the special
Australian definition is given. It could not
be expected that slang and local usages
would be comprehensively treated in a book
of this kind. There is still room for a re-
vised edition of Morris’s Austral-English at
the price of this Concise Oxford Dictionary,

CAPT. H. E. U. BURKE.
An African
Letter to ...
CLEMENTS TONIC
Testimony received from Capt. H. E. U. BURKE, late
3rd King’s African Rifles, British E. Africa, and
Assistant Master, Sydney Grammar School, College
Street, Sydney. States his opinion of what Clements
Tonic can do in cases of Fever, Wasting Illness, Loss
of Sleep or Appetite, Indigestion, or Convalescence
after severe illness.
“ The Cottage,” 250 Ocean Street,
Paddington, 17/1/Tl.
CLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“ I have benefited much by your medicine, principa ly in Africa
where it was first given to me by an Australian, after a severe attack of
malafial fever. I was taken to Nairobi, the centre of Govt, in British
E. Africa, in a state of collapse. The greatest care had to be taken
during mv convalescence.
“My Australian friend gave me three bottles. It improved my
appetite, creating desire for food, the beginning of a general restoration
to health, transforming a condition of extreme debility to one of
splendid strength.
“ I was so impressed with the medicine that I recommended it to
my brother officers. I have cause to be very grateful to this excellent
medicine, and, as I am now in Sydney, I am only fulfilling a duty in
testifying to its w r orth. You may use this letter as you like.”
(Signed) H. E. U. BURKE (Capt.).
This testimony is of a high order, and proves the singular health-creative properties this medicine
possesses. Persons restored to health of such serious ailments as Insomnia, Brain-fag, Defective
Memory, Melancholia, Nerve-breakdown, Constipation, Broken Rest, Indigestion, Anaemia or Poor
Blood, Biliousness and Sick Headache, write onty for the public benefit.

THIKT WOMEJX i
A thin woman is not necessarily plain, let alone ugly. In
fact, many thin women possess very pretty, “sweet faces,” but
this is usually admitted with the qualifying phrase, “but,
poor thing, she is so dreadfully thin.”
A woman’s chief charm is a well-rounded figure and a full
bosom. With these, thin arms and hollow cheeks are a rarity.
Thousands of women suffering the ravages of ill-health have
sought and accepted this advice, and to-day are models of
womanly development and examples of perfect health.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week.
We want you to know just what “Flesh-Food” is, and will
gladly give you a free sample. Send 2d. stamp, and let uS
forward a free trial sample and our instructive book. “Flesh-
Food” is put up in tablet form, and can be secretly taken if
desired. All correspondence is confidential and private, and all
our literature is sent closely covered and free from observa-
tion. Write at once. It is absolutely Free.

VARIUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Psalm of Life.
With a book, and a pipe, and a willow tree,
And a breeze to ripple the pages,
I feel I am great, I know I am free,
The king of the marching ages.
My pipe may be empty, but Cissy knows
Exactly the way to fill it,
And if in these pastures a microbe grows
The sweet blue smoke will kill it.
Her hair is rippling round her face
In exquisite, rich disorder,
And the dancing leaves on her white frock trace
A delicate lace-work border.
Is there any lack of a bottle of wine?
Though Omar might deride us,
The billy we boiled, with lid ashine,
Stands there on the grass beside us.
Instead of a simple loaf of bread,
Or a rocky chunk of damper,
Cissy and I have richly fed
On sandwiches from the hamper.
Little we reck of bale or bliss,
Or the problems that lick the sages,
If the sun kept warm, we could lie like this
And be glad for a dozen ages.
The statesman furrows his brow with care,
And the poet sweats at his riming,
And some idiot tries to patrol the air,
Up the stairs of the. breezes climbing.
And another is mad upon raising spooks,
And gathers his proofs in bunches,
While some, with dishevelled and downcast looks,
Are hunting for counter-lunches.
We hold that the world is undoubtedly queer,
But we never ask its meaning,
For my world is the sunshine around me clear,
And the girl against me leaning.
I wouldn’t take on the job to make
A better earth than this is,
With the sun ashine, and the right to take
A sufficient number of kisses.
For Cissy is really a wondrous girl,
And I bless the day I met her,
I wouldn’t exchange her smallest curl
For all that the saints hold better.

Heroes.
In the Streets of Little Ease
There were shouting, laughter, cheers,
In a back-room on her knees
Wailed a woman wan with tears.
Bands were playing in the street,
“See the Conquering Hero Comes!”
Urchins sped with naked feet
At-the rumble of the drums. -
Soldiers, splendid in their pride,
Thrilled with conscious majesty,
Triumph in their measured stride,
Marched, a glittering panoply.
In the richest trappings, dressed,
As befitting one that bore
Many medals on his breast,
Rode the demi-god of war.
He, astride a chestnut cob,
With a light hand on the rein,
Never smiled, withal the mob
Shouted, cheered and cheered again.
Through the streets of Little Ease
Eager people followed them; .
Lone, the woman on her knees,
Wept a lonely requiem.
AVhen the splendid pageant passed,
Lo! a dark procession came,
Like a gloomy thought that fast
Followed in the wake of Fame.
Half a dozen wretched folk
Trailed behind the sable coach
Sullenly, and never spoke,
But their eyes were a reproach.
He that held the reins was named
Death, and hasting slowly, he,
And the mutes looked half ashamed
Of such motley company.
He within had fought for years,
Nameless, an heroic past....
Wondering to hear the cheers,
Gloomily they followed fast.

A Dream.
I had a dream. I stood alone
It seemed, before the Great White Throne.
The Judge upon me bent Ilis look ;
The knees of my poor spirit shook.
An Angel vast stood near by me
To read out my biography.
Great awe and terror on me fell
Before he spake a syllable.
I knew the black and dreadful screed
That in a moment he would read.
“O Lord,” I cried, “let me explain”—
But these excuses were in vain.
The Judge said —“What was his chief crime?”
“He wrote, O Lord, a book of rhyme.”
The Judge, while Gabriel looked grim,
Said —“Much may be forgiven him.
“When I, who made the Cosmos grand,
And you and him, took first in hand
“Creation as a steady thing,
I made the stars together sing.
“You see, we always so begin—
It is a very venial sin—■
“In fact, a sin of no amount;
So, Gabriel, cross out his account.”
And Gabriel did, and I was free
Of Heaven for Eternity.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiie Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin," is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1911.
THE DEPARTURE (THANK THE LORD!)
OF FOREIGN CAPITAL.
The Australian Corporation of Public Ac-
countants sat in solemn conclave a few days
ago at Adelaide, and the president, one T.
Brentnall, from Melbourne, heaved him-
self up to speak words of warning into the
bowl-like ear of this day and generation.
These are some of the words: —
It is too soon yet to estimate the full effect of
the Federal land-tax, but it is a significant fact that
since its imposition a large number of valuable pro-
perties have* been *sold, and in most cases the money
has gone out of the country, and will not be re-
invested here ... In these days of abounding pros-
perity one hardly dares to sound a pessimistic note,
yet those who recall the crisis of 1893 are somewhat
sharply reminded of many similar conditions.
It is well to have a few pessimists in the
community lest Jeshurun should wax fat
and kick out of his turn, yet T. Brentnall
seems hardly the right man for the job. It
is quite true, as he remarks, that there are
many points of resemblance between the cir-
cumstances of 1911 and those of the years
just before 1893. There is the same joyous
confidence, the same vast expansion of trade
including an absurd increase of imports, the
same hilarious whooping-up of the price of
land, the same great and notable rise in
bank deposits, and, most unfortunately, the
same mania for encouraging the Public Debt.
So far, the resemblance is complete, but
after that it begins to break down. There
isn’t the same crop of shoddy land banks—
not yet, at all events. The cash reserves of
the legitimate banks are very much larger,
in proportion to the call liabilities, than
they were just before the bottom fell out of
all creation, hereabouts, 18 years ago. Above
all things, there is now the holy and blessed
and remembersome circumstance pointed out
by T. Bkentnall and other Tories, that
capital—the capital of the absentee investor,
that is—is leaving the country, and has been
doing so for a number of years. So many
Conservatives who are honorable men —the
same as Bkentnall and Brutus —have at-
tested to this departure of capital that it is
impossible to doubt it. The exit has not
been sudden but continuous, yet instead of
Australian financial institutions closing up
through inability to meet the demand, they
have paid all lawful claims quite cheerfully,
and instead of the drain reducing their re-
sources their casli assets have increased.
The latest recorded flight is the capital of
the awful Van Diemen’s Land Co., whose
wasted acres are now passing to an Austra-
lian syndicate; and a good deal of the
Coopek wealth is also departing now that
these chronic stayers-away are driven to sell
their property to small local holders. Thank
the Lord, foreign capital is leaving the
country! That is to say, a great deal of the
principal is leaving, wherefore the constant
departure of the interest is coming to an
end. So. (again thank the Lord!) Austra-
lian capital is beginning to stay in the
country for the first time in many years.
It was quite different just before the
downfall of 1893. In those days foreign
capital wasn’t leaving the country. It was
streaming in as the blessed Tory thinks it
should do now, to develop the great local
resources. Taking Australia and Maoriland
together, it is estimated by Statistician
Cogiilan that the money of absentees
poured into Australia during a terrace of
strenuous years was as shown hereunder: —

It was a grand time for absentee invest-
ment —a time when no beastly democrats
were discouraging the influx of money or
driving foreign capital out of the country
with a graduated land tax. But the trouble
was that during the 22 years included in the
above list no less than £205,514,000 left
Australasia as interest, dividends and profits
to the absentee investor, so that though
£234,300,000 of absentees’ capital came in
only a trifle of £28,786,000 remained in.
And when the British investor struck a
frightful snag in his own country at the
time of the Baring bank collapse, and sud-
denly stopped the supply, and even wanted
his money back and refused to be pacified
with notes as the Australian depositor was
in New South Wales and Queensland, it was
impossible to pay £234,300,000 out of
£28,786,000, and almost equally impossible
for the country which had been drunk on
absentee capital for 20 years or so to get sober
immediately, so Australia and Maoriland
had to ask for time from their creditors, and
get down to desperately hard work and short
rations in order to move the dead horse off
the premises.
* * * *
Since then (thanks to Providence and
better Government!) a great deal has been
done in the way of driving absentee capital
out of the country. The rising democratic
party hasmade many grievous blunders, but
its persistence in hunting foreign capital off
the face of this continent covers a multitude
of sins. Though the population has in-
creased since 1893 there is every reason to
believe that the outflow of money in the way
of interest, dividends and profits to the ab-
sentee person has greatly diminished. As
foreign capital has been driven out —which
is another way of saying that foreign in-
terest has been driven in—the cash reserves
of Australian banks have expanded from
less than £20,000,000 which these institu-
tions were able to show in 1892, after the
sudden influx of some £200,000,000 of
foreign capital, to something well over
£33,000,000. And though the lamentable bor-
rowing policy still continues, Australia does
things now (with foreign capital being
driven out) in the way of financing its own
undertakings which seemed 10 different kinds
of impossible in those fine old Tory days
when the absentees’ money was rushing in.
Last financial year, for instance, out of the
£6,325,216 borrowed by the wildly lavish
N.S.W. Government, £6,324,637 was ob-
tained in Sydney, and only £579 was cadged
in England. In the last five years no less
than £16,410,167 has been borrowed in Syd-
ney, and part of that went to pay off old
British loans. Since the floating of local
loans began, which was only after the great
slump in the importation-of-foreign-capital
business, N.S.W. has depended upon its own
money market, for two-thirds of its accom-
modation, and has struck the rather sur-
prising fact that it is a much better market
than the great Bull metropolis. For instance,
the lowest interest rate at which the Ma
State has raised the wind in London since the
bank-breakage year has been £3 Is. 84d. per
cent, against £3 os. s|d. per cent, in Sydney,
which is Is. 2|d. per cent, in favor of Sydney.
And the highest price paid for accommoda-
tion in London has been £4 10s. 2|d. per
cent, against £4 ss. 10|d. per cent, in Syd-
ney, which shows an advantage of 4s. 4d.
per cent, in favor of Sydney. Considering
all these circumstances it is difficult to be a
complete pessimist. No doubt there will be
great financial disasters in the future as there
have been in the past, but so long as foreign
capital is steadily driven out of the country
it is difficult to believe that Australia will
ever again see, in a time of profound peace,
splendid seasons and good prices, such a
hideous downfall as that of 18 years ago.
Certainly there is no evidence of it just
now. Many of the signs are the same as in
the late ’Bo’s of last century, but the one
utterly hopeless and disastrous sign—the one
plague spot which there is no mistaking—
the great influx of the absentee person’s
capital for investment, is not visible. That
kind of capital—may the heavens be praised!
—is still being driven out.
THE BOOK OF THE LAMENTATIONS
OF THE PROPHET POCKLEY.
The facts before them, and the more immediate
conclusions to be drawn from them, were of concern
in regard to the colonisation of northern Australia.
Here there was a tropical country, unique in having
no native colored races sufficiently numerous or will-
ing or able to help in developing the country. Unless
science came to their aid in providing some means
by which they could resist tropical influences, above
and beyond protozoal diseases, and if they were to
believe in history and natural selection, it would
appear to be inevitable that if they were to con-
tinue to hold this fine country, they must either
let it remain unnroductive, or comparatively so, or
they must evolve some scheme by which they could
develop it, by using colored labor. (Applause.)—
Dr. Pockley, in his Presidential address to the
Medical Congress.
A permanent reaching-out for nigger labor
is one of the earmarks of the old Tory. He
craves for nigger labor, apparently, for three
reasons: (1) Because he thinks it is cheap;
(2) because he thinks it is humble and
docile, and his conviction that the worker
should be very humble and very docile is in-
curable ; (3) because he thinks it doesn’t
want a vote, and his conviction that nobody
save himself should have a vote is also in-
curable. Starting from this basis he has
evolved, on no evidence whatsoever, or rather
in the face of all evidence, a theory that
without nigger labor the case of Northern
Australia is quite hopeless. The Bulletin
doesn’t know whether Hr. Pockley has ever
been in the North or not; certainly in his
address to the Medical Congress he made no
claim to first-hand knowledge of that
country. In that respect he is behind the
writer of this article, who does claim to have
lived, worked and travelled in tropical Aus-
tralia. But in the Book of the Lamenta-
tions of the Prophet Pockley it is set down
that if the white man can live and work
and prosper in tropical Australia he will do
so in violation of all precedent. And this
attitude sets one wondering where Pockley
found his precedents.
As a matter of fact, the white influx into
the tropical parts of this Commonwealth is
an event which stands alone. There are no
precedents. Many times before, in the stormy
history of this flying speck which we cail
Earth, the white man has gone into the
tropics. There he found, in every previous
case, hostile colored forces, and great, or at
least considerable, colored peoples. He found
the colored man’s germs, and the colored
man’s dirty, undrained, unwholesome towns
and cities. Also, he found a large and often
shambling and inefficient colored working
population, which he either enslaved or hired
at low wages to do the jobs which, in his
capacity as a soldier and a conqueror, he
didn’t want to do himself. As a result, two
kinds of tropical white man have gradually
developed—one better and one worse. There
is the permanent white settler of Mexico,
Central America, Colombia, Venezuela,
Guiana, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, most of
Brazil, portions of Chili, Argentina and
Paraguay, and of the Northern Transvaal.
Pie has dwelt for centuries in the tropics,
and has multiplied there, and has shown
himself, in most cases, a sturdy fighter and
a person of no small possibilities. Yet, he
has. always suffered from the fact that,
having a colored population to dig and hoe
for him, he hasn’t got right down to the soil,
and he has always had to contend with the
colored man’s diseases and the colored man’s
influences. Then there is the temporary
white man of India, Egypt, and such-like
places—the mere hotel dweller, who never
dreams of attempting actual settlement, and
who simply goes out for a few years as a
soldier, official or merchant. The British
hotel-dweller in crowded India has not
amounted to much as' a settler; no hotel-
dweller is expected to do so. But the perman-
ent Spanish and Portuguese colonist of the
tropics has been a success where he has
kept his white blood pure, and a modified or
complete failure in proportion as he mixed
it with the blood of negroes or aborigines.
These experiments have nothing to do
with the case or Northern Australia. That
is a business which flies by itself. There is
no other instance in all the world or in all
the world’s history where a white race has
found a tropical region with no colored
population worth mentioning, no special
native diseases, no dirty native cities or
towns, and no cheap docile local nigger to
do the hard work. Northern Australia is
the one tropical spot on record where the
white man has been his own laborer, where
he has inherited no ancient black, brown or
yellow problems or traditions, where he has
taken off his coat and proceeded to get up
an honest and manly perspiration—where,
in short, he has started from scratch. And,
so far, the results have been satisfactory
enough. Settlement happened to start at
the south end of Australia, because in the
days of sailing ships Torres Straits, and the
island-studded Timor Sea, and the treacher-
ous waters inside the Barrier Reef were not
easy places to navigate, and the original
settlers who tried to make the first begin-
nings of tnis country up there were wrecked.
And for lack of transcontinental railways,
settlement, having begun at the south, had to
crawl laboriously northward along the coast.
It has crawled to remarkably good purpose,
seeing that there are still living men who
were born before the first white township
began in Queensland. Inside the tropics
there are promising centres such as Rock-
hampton, Townsville, Cairns, Charters
Towers, Cloncurry, Lopgreach, Hughenden,
Winton and very many more. On the other
side of the continent population is also
moving northwards at a steady rate. The
young children on the coast of North Queens-
land now represent, in not a few cases, the
third generation of settlers. Thev are a
sturdy and hopeful race. The local birth-rate
is higher than that of England ; the death-
rate is not only about 40 per cent, lower
than that of England, but it is, bar the
death-rates of South Australia and Maori-
land, the lowest in the world. Also, it gets
lower as the north fills up. These tropical
settlers have penetrated to the farthest
north of Australia —farther than the most
northern part of the Territory—and, so far,
nothing has gone wrong with them. In
fact, the experiment they have made is the
most remarkable and almost the most pro-
mising one that the world has on hand just
now, though the virulent Tory wants to
abandon it as a failure. Possibly, some day,
the birth-rate in the north may drop 50 per
cent., and the death-rate rise 100 per cent..
and the white man may begin to wilt and
the population to diminish. But there are
no such signs at present, and until they
arrive the Book of the Lamentations of the
I rophet Pockley is an unsaleable volume
* * * *
Last week there was presented to the
House ot Representatives the report of the
expedition which recently visited the
Northern Territory under the leadership of
Professors Spencer and Gilbuth. This was
the tale of eminent scientific men who had
been there, not the loose theories of an
elderly city eye and ear doctor, living hun-
dreds of miles away from the scene of
action. A few extracts from the newspaper
summary of the report are as follows:
In the Territory the European’s health was re-
markably good. They were told that children should
be sent away at the age of 10 or 12, but they de-
cline to say that the practice is necessary for health.
Tropical diseases, such as malaria and dysentery
were not endemic, except in mining townships, and
need not be anticipated so long as hygienic pre-
cautions were observed. The school children’s
standard of intelligence was equal to that of southern
settlements, and the physique and energy of the
men, who had spent 30 or 40 years in the Territory,
compared favorably with men elsewhere. The
healthiest and strongest men and women were those
who took regular exercise even in the heat.
Life in the back country is reported on very
favorably. It is decidedly healthy, winter low tem-
peratures—often 40 deg.—affording recuperation,
from the excessive damp heat of the summers. The
scientists saw heavy dews, fogs and even ice.
“Though this part of Australia is well within the
tropics, it is not really tropical in its nature...”
“The stock were in excellent health... The general
condition of the horses was good. Sheep culture had
scarcely been attempted, but goats are healthy,
prolific and valuable lor milk and meat. Pigs are
scarce, but in good condition.”
That doesn’t read like the description of a
land which should be thrown as a dead and
gone proposition to the first nigger who
comes along. Of course there is always the
plea that the white man has “failed to settle
the Territory.” And certainly, for the few
brief years of the man’s ownership, he
has failed. In the same way the white man
failed for nearly three centuries to settle the
centre and west of Canada and the United
States. Even England failed for some mil-
lions of years to accumulate a decent popu-
lation. And Prussia, 450 years ago, had just
about as many people as Sydney, yet it
didn’t despair and give itself away to China-
men. It is always unwise to jump to the
conclusion that a child’s throat should be cut
because it doesn’t grow up in a day. Or that
two young married people should give their
spare house room over permanently to
Soudanese on the ground that it will
never be wanted by their own family,
just because twins haven’t been born
within three months after the wedding day.
Or that Dr. Pockley should be disqualified
from the practice of his profession because
he hasn’t, in one brief lifetime, found in-
fallible remedies for cancer, leprosy and
tuberculosis, and that his business and his
brass plate should be given over to a Solo-
mon Islander. The doctrine of crazy haste
can be overdone.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Triumph of Anarchy.
When times are stormy, and the public
temper grows perilously short, agitators,
outrage-fomenters and such-like dangerous
insects, generally crawl from beneath
the nearest flat stone and get busy. Their
office is to persuade as big a section of
the public as they can get to listen to them,
that conditions are so intolerable that riot
is justifiable, not to say admirable. The
Law has an ugly name for this sort of thing
and, where it is done crudely, leaps on the
offender with no uncertain hoof. The Syd-
ney morning dailies have been inciting poli-
ticians and others to riot and bloodshed for
about a month now in connection with the
N.S.W. Speakership business, and they
haven’t even the excuse of principle to jus-
tify their disorder-breeding. As recently as
August 18, the S. M. Herald took this
eminently-reasonable view of Willis’s ac-
ceptance of the billet about which all the
disturbance has arisen :
The Government is, we think, doing the constitu-
tionally right thing in endeavoring to carry on in-
stead of forcing a dissolution at the present moment.
Apparently Labor intends to hold office only so long
as is necessary to get through the Electoral Bill, the
Redistribution of Seats Bill, the Estimates, and some
other pressing matters that do not specifically imply
its special programme. This is a very proper way of
looking at the situation, and as we have already
said, it should have the assistance, if possible the
cordial assistance, of the Opposition. To hold an
election on obsolete rolls and obsolete electoral boun-
daries is repugnant to common sense, and there does
not seem to be any outstanding reason why Parlia-
ment should not get its electoral machinery in good
order before attempting another shuffle of the cards.
Suddenly the ukase went forth from the.Pitt-
street headquarters of “Liberalism” that the
man who had dared to put the interests of
N. S. Wales before those of C. G. Wade was
to be crucified. On August 21 the Herald
came out with the following:—
Of all the tempests that have swept through the
legislative halls of this State, none will equal the
one Mr. Willis will face when he presents himself
for election to the Speakership on Wednesday. If
the Liberals meet the House i-n the temper they were
in at the end of last week, this new knight of the
political arena will be up against a hurricane.
The Telegraph gave the office to ,the
bravoes of “Liberalism” in somewhat simi-
lar terms. The next morning both papers
informed their readers that every “Liberal,”
worthy the name, was thirsting for Willis’s
blood ; that he was a traitor and a fool; and
that if an enraged Opposition seized the
earliest opportunity to fall upon him,
it would be no more than he deserved.
On .the 23rd Willis, scenting trouble, said
in the Telegraph :
The press has suggested the possibility of Par-
liament being turned into a brawl when the election
of Speaker is proposed. That is impossible in an
assembly of gentlemen, and improbable in this Par-
liament.
But he was wrong. The rank and file of
Parliamentary “Liberalism” had not studied
their party newspapers in vain. For 20 hours
this man, who had done no worse than help
to accomplish that which, six days pre-
viously, the Herald had argued was “the
constitutionally right thing to do,” lay back
patiently and listened to a stream of
“Liberal” abuse and Billingsgate that,
in many Assemblies, would have led to gun-
practice and bloodshed. And, even then,
the party of disorder hadn’t finished with the
man whose worst crime was that he had
prevented an election being held “on obsolete
rolls and obsolete electoral boundaries.
Willis announced that he would explain the
situation in his constituency. As plainly as
any Anarchist orator ever urged his audience
to loot and violence the dailies told the
Anti-Labor electors of the Upper Hunter to
close Wn.T.TR’s mouth. For over a month
now, the “Liberals” in Parliament have de-


liberately held up the business of the N. S.
Wales Assembly and rendered it a byword
and an object of scorn from one end of Aus-
tralia to the other. During that time the
smaller or gutter papers of “'Liberalism”
have contained enough scurrilities concerning
the Speaker, his family, his intellect and his
character, to provoke him and his friends to
every conceivable breach of the peace, from
plain assault to daylight murder. The
climax was reached wtien various Par-
liamentary “Liberals” hurled books and
similar weighty missiles at the Speak-
er’s head—blue metal not being avai-
lable. This tne Telegraph, claimed
(20/9/’ll) was “humanly inevitable,” and
tbe Herald reasoned on the same morning
that it constituted a sound reason for imme-
diately holding that election (“on obsolete
rolls and obsolete electoral boundaries”),
which, four weeks before, it had damned as
an idea “repugnant to common-sense.” Nine-
tenths of the credit for this criminal busi-
ness unquestionably rests with the papers
which have egged on the perpetrators of out-
rage. It is a cheerful reflection for journals
which have hitherto had a certain claim to
be on the side of Law and order.

A Wholly Hypothetical Hoskins.
Dear Bulletin, —I see in the press re-
peated clamors by certain Labor bodies that
there should be no compulsory military
training in Australia, and that this country
should have neither an efficient army nor a
useful navy. Also, there are numerous roars
to the effect that it should look forward help-
lessly, but hopefully, to a time when all in-
ternational disputes will be settled by an
Arbitration Court, whose awards, though
backed by no force whatsoever and capable
of being disregarded with impunity, will be
frankly and fully accepted by all parties con-
cerned. At the same time, I seem to keep
running across the tale of a frantic and long-
continued strike at Lithgow (N.S.W.) —a
strike which goes on in defiance of arbitra-
tion awards, though the N.S.W. Arbitration
Court has far more force betiind it than the
Hague tribunal possesses. Now, why, if
these “anti-militarists” have such profound
faith in the acceptance, by conflicting na-
tions, of the awards of a prospective court
on which all manner of colored and hostile
and cheap labor and long hours and non-
union peoples will necessarily he represented
• —why don’t they live up to their own creed
by always peacefully accepting the awards
of their own Arbitration CourtV It would be
an easier job than the other. The local in-
stitution is a much better one to get on with
than any possible international court will
be, especially when the Jap and the Chinese
and Siamese and Hindu members thereof sit
to consider the appeal of Nippon or Tim-
buctoo against Australia’s theory that
colored races are unfit to come into this
country. Why (to resume the questioning
attitude) do the Anti-Defence Laborites de-
clare arbitration in their own small case a
plain, unmitigated failure, and yet urge the
country to trust to it over questions which
may involve the wiping out of our race and
color and all our institutions, the Trades Hall
included? Why do they throw bricks (for
some bricks certainly have been thrown),
and yet say that peace is at hand and can
be relied upon ? Peace is not bricks any more
than a dog is a serpent, nor does the go-
hanna live as a regular thing in the Equit-
able Building. Sydney. Why do they keep
their own industrial army organised, ready
tor a struggle to the death whenever arbi-
tration makes a bad failure of things, and
yet urge the country to remain unarmed and
unorganised, on the ground that the blessed
thing can’t be a failure? Why do they ask
Australia to trust the Mikado and Kaiser
William when they themselves won’t trust
Hoskins, of Lithgow? The present atti-
tude of a certain section of Labor is that
arbitration has completely broken down, and
at the same time that the said object will
never break down. Let me ask the Anti-
Australian party among the Laborites to
more fully consider Hoskins, of Lithgow.
Let him be viewed as an almost absolute
Hos Kins, with all his bad qualities, what-
ever they may be, multiplied by the insane
pride of high station and royal descent. Let
him be a Hoskins brought up in the doc-
trine of divine right, and urged on by his
own ambition and the ambition of a con-
siderable section of his subjects. Suppose
him to be, for all practical purposes, a
200,000 or a r 2,000,000 times bigger Hoskins
than he is. Let him be occasionally a black
or yellow or brown Hoskins, but never a
striped Hoskins. And then let a solitary,
unarmed, unorganised worker with no sup-
port behind him ask this Hoskins to arbi-
trate — a Hoskins who would be about two
miles high and wild in proportion ; to come
down to that solitary worker’s level; to sub-
mit all disputes between himself and that
unarmed and unorganised worker to a court
that had no single shred of power wherewith
to enforce its decisions—a court half the
size, for real fighting purposes, of theatrical
manager Jimmy McMahon —and to swear
that he -would abide by its decisions, quite
regardless of the fact that the solitary
worker was himself no great hand at abid-
ing by similar decisions when he found them
disagreeable and had the power to reject
them. Let him ask Hoskins, in fact, to
give away the game when he has it in his
hand. And then let the Anti-Defence section of
the Labor party consider the probable roar
of this Hoskins —this wholly hypothetical
Hoskins, two miles high and wild in pro-
portion —and the way his snort of fury
would blow the crops off the surface of 16
parishes. If tjie said section doesn’t like
that orospect, then it can’t blame me for
not liking the prospect its anti-defence pro-
posals open out before me. Still, I am a
reasonable person, and will make a fair
offer. If there are no strikes in Australia
for 20 years ; if for 20 years every award of
the Arbitration Court is cheerfully accepted
and fully obeyed; if Labor finds that it can
safely disband (and does disband) its com-
pulsory service industrial army, which is to
say its trades unions—then I will join the
Peace Brigade and vote for keeping Aus-
tralia unarmed and unorganised. And I will
recognise that the great unarmed millennium
has begun when Labor shakes hands with
Hoskins (I admit that I never shook hands
with him myself), and asks him to din-
ner. and sings a rousing chorus to the effect
that he is a jolly good Hoskins. —Yours,
etc., Henry Hqrsecollar.

An Appeal for Plain Speech.
Dr. Ham read a paper on venereal disease
before the Medical Congress, last week, and
the S. M. Herald came boldly out with a
leader on the subject. Some extracts: —
Dr. Ham dealt with a matter of the utmost import-
ance to any community, and he was fully justified in
calling for the sympathy and support of all those
who are in a position to influence public opinion.. ..
The facts of life are there to be faced in whatever
way they may arise, and it is the most mawkish of
morality to refuse to face them....A great deal of
nonsense is talked as to the inadvisability of refer-
ring to these things at all. How terrible is the price
that we pay for that concession to a false sentiment!
... It is almost impossible to get attention drawn to
the evil in any effective ' way. A conventional
hypocrisy blocks the most elementary steps of reforni.
. .. We do most heartily emphasise the author’s claim
for frankness and freedom in the discussion of one of
the gravest of social problems.
The Herald helped to “drag the facts”
about syphilis, as it put it, “from the fester-
ing night into the light of day” (1) by re-
fraining from mentioning even the name
of the horror once in the whole
course of its article: (2) by omit-
ting to publish an intelligible sentence of
Hr. Hails paper; (3) by telling the pub-
lic nothing whatever as to how to avoid or
cure this calamity, which, as it remarked,
afflicts "not merely the contracting parties,
but generations—innocent generations —yet
unborn.” Since the other big Sydney daily
acted similarly—with the exception that it
didn’t even waste space on a blankly mysteri-
ous leader concerning Ham’s effort —the
readers of these two delicate rags know as
much about syphilis now as thev did before
the Medical Congress met, which is to say
practically nothing. Joiin Bunyan termed
tuberculosis “the captain of the men of
death and in the 17th century it had a
fair claim to the title. To-day it is a mere
corporal in the army, and there is every
likelihood of its being drummed out of the
regiment altogether in the near future. As
a result of the desperate war waged by the
medical profession on this disease ; the lavish
financial help given in the cause by the civi-
lised nations (the British Government cheer-
fully spent £76,000 on a Royal Commission
on Tuberculosis, the other day) ; and the
educational campaign that has been con-
ducted in the newspapers, by pamphlets and
on platforms, it has declined over 50 per
cent, in the past 50 years. The president of
the Glasgow Local Government Board, in his
opening address at the recent tuberculosis
conference, said :
In 25 or 30 years tuberculosis should be a memory
of the past, like typhus, leprosy and plague.
Meanwhile syphilis—an even more dreadful
and far-reaching complaint—increases apace,
and, to all intents and purposes, unchecked.
This is particularly so in most parts of Aus-
tralia. Mr. R. M. Me. Anderson, speaking
at St Stephen’s Church, PhilJip-streef, Syd-
ney, a few weeks back, quoted a report pre-
sented to the House of Commons (1907)
with regard to the health of the Australian
Squadron as follows : —-
With the exception of venereal diseases the ratios
in reference to all the important diseases are satis-
factory. In this respect, Sydney has the unenviable
distinction of figuring easily highest, the percentage
of crews suffering from venereal disease, after sojourn
in Port Jackson, being 214.75 per thousand* or more
than one man in five.
Mr. Anderson continued
While Sydney is the worst place in the world, Bris-
bane, the next port of call, is practically free of the
scourge, and they ascribe it to the Contagious
Diseases Act of Queensland, which is worked satisfac-
torily, but against which, periodically, the Churches
used to arise in their wrath to demand its repeal.
In 1908 the Wade Government introduced a Conta-
gious Diseases Act, but I have to say with deep
regret that the convenor of committee of the religious
and public morals of our own Church actually for-
warded a letter objecting to the passing of this most
beneficent Act.
The chief reason for this hideous state of
things is the craven dread the local daily
press has always had of plain speech on the
matter. Once instructed on the subject of
this disease, which is responsible for more
insanity, crippled and deformed children,
and all-round ill health and misery, than
any other thing on earth, and the public
would see to it that the State took the same
drastic steps to wipe it out as it has taken
to eradicate plavue and smell-pox. But so
long as the question is burked by the papers,
or mentioned only, as in the case above-men-
tioned, in such a wealth of genteel peri-
phrasis as to render it incomprehensible to
all but those who don’t need information,
syphilis must continue to blast the national
health as heretoiore.

The Wowser on a Good Wicket.
Wowserism, for once in a way, has taken
up an unassailable position in Victoria.
Wowserism is waving the flag of Fair Play
for Workers. It snorts at the sacred
rights of Proputty. It fires from be-
hind a barrier of Common Sense.
Melbourne Social Reform League lately
waited on burly Frank Madden, the State
Speaker, to ask him to take charge of a
petition praying Parliament to extend the
Early Closing Act to bars, and put the
workers therein on the game level as the
employees of other shops. The petition
carried the signatures of hotel employees,
which gave it a sufficiently democratic char-
acter. Poop Frank Madden had to pro-
mise that the document would be duly pre-
sented to the House, and then he began to
unpack his soul: —
He asked whether the petitioners had any scheme
to deal fairly with Vested Interests. Hotelkeepers
had entered into leases under existing conditions.
They had to pav premiums and high rents under the
leases. Would the petitioners do the publicans the
injustice of reducing their hours of trading without
compensation? etc., etc.
And he asked them to “consider a fair
scheme for getting their prayer carried into
effect, and not to ask for what would be
ridiculed.” Now, every sort of established
shop business was sold in the dark old days,
prior to Early Closing legislation, under the
conditions that then existed, and never a
word was said about compensation to the
owners when their hours of business were
reduced in number. It was reasonably
pleaded that the public would buy all the
goods it required within the legalised shop-
ping limit. It can be just as reasonably
argued that the public can buy all the liquor
it requires within the hours appointed for
purchasing bread, ironmongery, bonnets,
etc. Frank Madden unblushinglv suggests
that common or grog-shop victuallers have
Vested Interests in supplying the public
with more beer than is required, and that,
inasmuch as the injurious superfluity would
be reduced in volume by extending butchers’
shop regulation to the beer-shopkeeper, the
latter would be entitled to compensation for
loss of trade. The drunks would _be
counted, presumably, and for any diminu-
tion or falling-off (not falling down) the
aggregate publican would be recompensed
at so much per drunk. It would be a rough
and ready process, for some drunks hold
more than .others, but there would be a cer-
tain crude justice about it —as the Frank
Madden clan understands justice.
A Conflict that Doesn’t Rage Worth
Tuppence.
Certain Federal and Cabbage Garden poli-
ticians are much disturbed over what they
call a conflict of policies. When the Superior
Legislature drew up its list of articles pro-
hibited of import it put prison-made goods
among them. Since then, it has_ offered a
bonus on the production of wire-netting
made in Australia from imported wire. Now
the Murray State employs some of its
prisoners in Pentridge at wire-netting
making, and these wiseacres ask what is the
use of trying to encourage an industry by
bonus if a State Government manufactures
what are really prohibited gqfcds? Also,
they ask, will the State Government apply
for a share of the bounty? There is no
reason why it shouldn’t; neither is there
any anomaly about the position. Foreign
prison-made goods are prohibited, not be-
cause they are made in gaols—Jliey are not
extra bad or over-adulterated on that ac-
count —but because they are often sold at a
rate with which private enterprise can’t
compete. They are cheap because the
prisoner often works long hours, gets little
or no wages, and has not to maintain either
himself or his wife and family. The policy
of prohibition should apply with equal force
to other goods that are the product of
cheap-labor and long-hour countries —jute
materials, for instance. The goods are pro-
duced primarily because it is better that
prisoners should be fully employed than
kept in idleness, even if the goods they pro-
duce have to be given away, but Australia
has no yearning to assist other countries to
solve their penal problems; also, it wants
all the manufactures it can get—hence the
prohibition and the bonus. But that policy
doesn’t apply to its own prisoners. They
must be maintained, therefore —and for
other reasons—they must work; and it is
better they should toil to maintain them-
selves than that, as is the case to-day, free
men should toil to maintain them. The fact
that they are where they are tends to prove
that they need a course of hard toil to in-
culcate habits of industry. Having then pro-
duced their goods—wire netting, f’rinstance
—these must be sold, and so long as the pro-
duct is sold at its market value no harm is
done. So far, there is no accusation that the
Weary State is selling below market value.
If there were so many prisoners that one
had to be maintained by every five “out-
siders.” instead of by every 600 or so as at
present, it would speedily dawn on these
objectors to prison labor that there are no
points about keeping confinees in idleness,
and that the harder they work the more they
produce, and the higher the price their pro-
ducts realise the better for everybody. Also,
when a prisoner has to do hard labor on
sensible lines —until he has earned enough
to cover the loss or injury he has caused —-
he will be as anxious as anybody else that
his products aren’t sold below market value.
A Free Country.
In answer to a voluminous correspondent; —
The Bulletin has been afflicted this week with a
gigantic communication of 21 closely-written pages
from an excited person residing near Hyde Park,
Sydney, which person demands —in 21 pages—that
this country should remain unarmed and defenceless,
and trust to Providence. Amid a great deal of talk
about the armies of Russia and other despotic coun-
tries, there is just one sentence which calls for a
certain amount of consideration:—-
“Does The Bulletin really believe that men,
trained and drilled under a compulsory military
system, can ever make a free people?”
After considering the cases of Switzerland, Den-
mark and Norway, generally considered about the
most liberal countries in Europe, the evidence is that
men trained and drilled under a compulsory system
can be free. In two of these States both Houses of
Parliament, and in the other State the Lower House
and four-fifths of the Upper, are elected by universal
suffrage. The people carry no loads except such as
they think best, which is also the position of the
people of Australia. The same definition applies to
France, Chili, Brazil and other spots. In all these
pl’ces a free nation has resolved that all-round mili-
tary education is a good thing, and has freely
adopted it. On the other hand, China, Persia, Turkey,
Morocco, San Domingo, Ilaita, Korea, and otljer States
have escaped universal compulsory military training,
and their joyous, advanced, progressive peoples are
a rather doubtful set of circumstances.
As it seems to be the custom to dig up aged and
r-'mote historical evidences, it may be mentioned that
old Poland, in its latter days—Poland where the
people were divided into slaves and nobles —had no
compulsory military service ; more than that, it dis-
liked “militarism” so much that, towards the end, it
had no army at all. There was no compulsory service
in the Roman or Greek empires in their last days, nor
in the slave States of Uncle Sam's country. Nor Is
there in Britain, with its hereditary Upper House, and
its Lower House elected mostly on a property fran-
chise. Whether all these countries rank or rank"'!
among the “free” is a matter of opinion. It all
depends on the definition of the adjective. In The
Bulletin's view a country is free when its burdens,
even though they be heavy, are imposed and main-
tained by the deliberate will of the adult population,
and it isn’t free if its burdens, even though they he
light, are imposed by a Government which is beyond
the control of the people. On that basis compul-
sory military training no more makes nor unmakes
freedom than compulsory education, or compulsory
drainage, or compulsory water supply. But if it is
held that all-round military training is the real test
of freedom, then we arrive at the result that Switzer-
land is now practically the most enslaved country in
the world, and that one of the most free and liberal
States going at present is Morocco. That may be the
case, but there is an air of improbability about the
matter somehow.

When the Progressive Land Tax was before
the Australian Parliament there was a
curious division of opinion amongst its Tory
opponents. One group predicted with great
fluency that the tax would have practically
no effect upon land values, and that land
would be as dear as ever. The other group
cursed the Bill as a “confiscatory measure,’’
and predicted that it would cause a disas-
trous slump in land values. The tax has
been in operation now for over a year, and
both groups are. apparently, no nearer an
agreement than before. During the speech
on the Address-in-Reply the following re-
marks were made in the Senate: —
Senator W. Russell: It would appear that the
progressive land tax is going to have the effect that,
instead of a few men getting a living from this
land. . .there will be 70 or 80 persons settled there.
Senator Millen: On paying a higher price than
was paid for the land a few years ago.
Senator W. Russell: I have said that the price
has gone up.
Senator Millen: So that the land tax has not pro-
cured cheap land for the people.
Next door, however, in the House of Reps.,
this sort of thing was being said:—-
Mr. Fisher: It is singular that, notwithstand-
ing this tax, land values in the aggregate have not
declined.
Mr. R. Foster: That is not correct.
Mr. Fisher: I say that, in the aggregate, land
values in Australia have not declined.
Mr. R. Foster: I say they have.
Mr. Hans Irvine : And in every State.
It would be pleasanter if Millen and Fos-
ter were to have a friendly conference, just
to decide which line they should follow, as
the present system is embarrassing. Foster
and Irvine both seem to overlook the fact
that the ultimate value of land is what it
will produce, clear of taxes and general ex-
penses. As the Federal tax does not hit
the average farm, and the value of land-
products is, if anything, on the up grade,, it
is only natural that land values should still
tend upward. The only possible interfer-
ence with this tendency would be the throw-
ing on the market of huge areas of previ-
ously locked-up and suitable land. As it
happens, while the land tax js sending-land
steadily into the market, the demand for it
by new settlers (including farmers’ sons! is
more than sufficient to maintain prices. The
position is simple enough, but the Irvines
and Fosters still wag their chins fatuously
and repeat their old gag—though they can-
not pick up a newspaper without seeing
their pet contention biffed in the eye, so to
speak.

Dog is eating dog on the Yarra wharves in
Melbourne. The importers, exasperated by
the jumble and the Gehenna and the chaos
of things under the management of the
Stevedoring companies, want to wipe that
bit of Private Enterprise out of existence.
Importers say that their goods are flung on
the wharves anyhow from the ships; they
are badly sorted and badly stacked, and may
be plunked in the middle of the road for
hours and days; whereupon an army of per-
sons called Pilferers get to work. They say
that shed space is wasted, that immoral
preferences are shown, and that the fear-
some charges they have to pay are making
Melbourne scandalously expensive as a port.
All this is what they suffer under Private
Enterprise, which gets hold of merchandise
as it drops out of the ship’s slings, and
tenaciously keeps its teeth in it until a
large enough bite has been taken. So in
their just wrath the importers say, “Damn
the Stevedores!” —-and they appeal to the
Harbor Trust to take over the whole of the
wharfinger business. The Harbor Trust! —
a Socialistic institution under public
management, and created by a Socialistic
Act of Parliament in the Socialistic year
1576 ! Next week, the same importers will
howl against some scheme of State Enter-
prise because it isn’t designed for their
special profit. At present, in fact, they have
just finished howling against Pearce,
Minister for Defence, because he intends to
build military factories for Australia. But
when they want system and organisation
for their own advantage, they turn at once
to Socialistic management. Which proves
what a damnable and carnivorous spirit is
in this same Socialism. It even makes dog
eat dog—and plain raw dog at that, not
boiled dog,.
Who Owns the Riverina?
I heard two Fat Men shouting in a fami-
liar key—•
Like twin volcanoes spouting their language
seemed to me!
They stood each side the Border (we still
have “borders” here)
And yelled in fierce disorder across the sham
frontier.
The noise they made was awful —whilst
cuss-words flew like rain ;
Each s" ore his claims were lawful, and
scoffed in loud disdain!
They raged with heat volcanic—yea, each
with frantic mien
Exclaimed ‘midst leaps galvanic: “/ own
the Riverine!”
Said New South Wales: “I’m certain this
land belongs to Me.”
Vic. yelled : “Go, lift the curtain of bygone
historee !
When What’s-His-Name reported in
Eighteen-blessed-two”-
“Yah ! Yah!” the Ma State snofted, “that
ancient yarn won’t do!
When Thingumbob surveyed it”—then Vic.
made swift reply :
“You’ll tell me next you made it! Oh, what
a flaring lie!”
’Twas thus those Fat Men wrangled—they
turned the climate green
Anent that question tangled: “Who owns
the Riverine?”
Then, 10, I heard a Stranger up-raise his
voice as well:
“Get out of this here manger ; get out and
go to h-11!”
Then both the Fat Men trembled, like Tories
brave and true;
Whilst each, in wrath dissembled, cried,
“Who on earth are you?”
Tne Stranger said: “My shingle hangs out
from Cairns to Perth.
I am Owner single of this here bit of
earth!
I am the whole great Nation,” remarked the
Stranger lean.
“The Younger Generation will boss the
Riverine!”
Went on the Stranger, slowly: “You Two
are fat of girth ;
In bondage vile, unholy, you hold Australia’s
earth !
Each side your bogus Border the untilled
acres lie —-
Fat is our Prison-warder. With Greed’s un-
sleeping eye!
Ye watch the people seeking for land to
plough and till —
I hear no waggons creaking witn wheat for-
ma rt and mill!
Ye wait the harvest golden,” proclaimed the
Stranger keen.
“This was your watchword olden: ‘Fat
owns the Riverine!’
“You Two,” observed the Stranger, “for
many galling years,
Like dogs wituin a manger, have held these
sham frontiers!
This Land, by Fat divided, has waited over-
long—
You Two have long denied it a Manhood
brave and strong!
This Empty Land is calling; it calls for
virile men;
Be off!” —his foot sent sprawling each vasty
Abdomen !
“Clear out!” exclaimed the Stranger, “you
spoil the pleasant scene ;
You are Australia’s danger—/ own the
Riverine!”

Aberdeen—the Hot Place Where the White
Man Can’t Live.
The coldest supporter White Australia has
got is Sydney Telegraph. That large and
misplaced organ seldom loses a chance to re-
mark how much it wants to keep this
country wiiite, and how broken-up with
grief it is because the thing is almost or
quite impossible. The Medical Congress, in
Sydney, brought forth two doctors in parti-
cular —one who declared that the north of
Australia was an ideal place for the white
settler, and another who had doubts. Where-
upon the Telegraph wept bitterly as fol-
lows :
It is highly desirable that competent investigators
should collect and analyse evidence on the spot in
this matter. The investigation to be conclusive
would have to extend, of course, over a wide range.
In fact, it would have to include practically the
whole of the very sparse white population of tropical
Australia. Dr. Breiul has apparently approached
the subject from the standpoint of an expert in tropi-
cal diseases. An enthusiast in that branch of re-
search might be expected to take the view that
when once the parasitic germs which he has to fight
have been fairly defeated, the white man can come
in and live in the country. But it may be pointed
out that the' white man has hitherto failed to make
good his foothold in the trop.eal regions of other
countries. The almost complete disappearance of the
pure white stock planted by the Spaniards and Portu-
guese in Central and South America is a significant
fact that cannot be ignored. The white populations
of South America to-day are found exclusively in the
temperate regions—in Argentina, for instance —and
even there they are only maintained by a strong and
steady flood of immigration.
It seems as if, in his haste, the Telegraph’s
ignoramus bad sworn a little too hard. He
says, for instance, that the white popula-
tions of South and Central America have
“completely disappeared” except in the tem-
perate regions such as Argentina. The
statement is a silly and bumptious and glar-
ing invention. The really white population
of tropical Spanish America is certainly not
large; it never was large, for Spain had very
little population or its own when it con-
quered these countries, and could only send
out a handful of men. It used to invade a
bm native State with 100 soldiers or so, and
a large proportion of these married brown
women for lack of sufficient white ones. Yet
there are something over 230,000 whites in
little, obscure, out-or-the-way Bolivia, which
corresponds with the region between Papua
and Central Queensland. Brazil, as
far back as 1872, had 3,787,000 white
inhabitants, of whom 3.543,000 were native
born; and that was before the great immi-
gration began. Yet Brazil is mostly tropical,
and extends right up to the equator; also,
it has grown a city of 230,000 people in
the same latitude as Port Darwin. Costa
Rica, in Central America, is mostly in-
habited by pure whites. Over 2,000,000 of
the population of Mexico is white. The
Chilians are mostly white, and there are
over 3,000,000 of them. In fact, the
original handful of white settlers, in-
stead of dying out, seems to have multi-
plied wonderfully. These facts can hardly
be unknown to the Telegraph ; but that
paper’s insane craving for nigger labor leads
it to ignore or flatly deny them. But it
makes a specially silly exhibition of itself
when it describes Argentina as a place where
the white race can only be “maintained by
a strong and steady flood of immigration.”
The south end of Argentina extends much
farther towards the Antarctic than the
south extremity of Maoriland (in fact, it
answers to the north of Scotland or the
south of Norway in the other hemisphere).
The republic's great centre of population is
in the same latitude as Sydney, and its
winter is colder. It is a wild, mad Tory
paper which represents Argentina as a place
where the white race can’t survive unless
helped out by immigration. Apparently the
'Graph is capable of declaring that the
white man is being killed off by the extreme
heat in the tronics of Aberdeen, and that
nigger labor must be procured instantly.

France and Germany in Morocco.
The Old Soldier’s views:—
The nation which Britain is backing in the present
Franco-German trouble isn’t by any means clean-
handed as regards Morocco. The French representa-
tive at Fez is Colonel Mangin, of the Algerian Rifles.
He combines with his representative character that
of Commandant of the Sultan’s mercenaries, much as
if the Sirdar of the Egyptian army were to be also
British Consul-General. Colonel Mangin had his
instructions from Paris to secure the payment by
the usurping Sultan Mulai Hafid of the advances
France had made to him, and he had also to use his
mercenaries to collect the Sultan’s revenue from the
tribes, who have never paid anyone except on com-
pulsion. That stirred up the tribes to resistance,
and Fez was besieged, and relieved by a French force
under General Moinier. Says a writer in Black-
wood for August:—
“It is not to be believed that France entered
lightly into the stupendous expense of these difficult
operations simply to save the lives of the few Euro-
peans who might easily have left Fez under safe
conduct to the coast, by consent of the invading
rebels. On the day that the investment of Fez was
raised, Dr. Vassal, the German Consul-General, had
Colonel Mangin. head of the French Military Mission,
‘stone dead.’ By that is meant that Mangin, with
his head inflated by the personal adulation that the
Parisian press had bestowed upon him, permitted the
French-trained. French-officered troops of the Magh-
zen to descend upon the peaceful homesteads of the
Uled Jama tribe, and to burn, ravish and destroy
as to them seemed sufficient. As a result of this
atrocious licence, much property of British- and
Germah-protected Moors was destroyed, arid children
of tender years were torn from their homes, and after
being ravished, were sold in the streets of Fez into
life-long slavery for a few silver coins. When
officially remonstrated with by the representatives of
friendly European Powers, the leader of the French
Mission is said to have replied: ‘THERE ARE NO
RIGHTS OF PRIVATE LIFE AND PROPERTY IN
A REBEL COUNTRY.’ ”
The cableman was careful to tell us nothing about
that last little touch of Col. Mangin’s quality, nor
has he told us of the. little plan that has been, since
the ’Bo’s of the last century, before the French Par-
liamentary Committee, for flooding Europe with a
French-trained, armed and equipped army of African
savages, to be raised and drilled in the negro coun-
tries south of the Sahara. In the War Budget
Committee’s Report for 1909, the former proposal
was recited, with this significant addition: —
“As it is obvious that the sanction of Parliament
to this increase of our black force may arouse dis-
trust among our own people, as well as others, it
has been decided to authorise publication (unoffi-
cially) of a work compiled by Lieut.-Col. Mangin,
which is here submitted. The committee will notice
that the scheme is presented as a temporary one for
bridging the interval required for restoring the
birthrate, b- means therein set forth, and it is
hoped that the very able arguments in favor of this
policy will allay public suspicion for the time
being.” *
The idea is “10 years hence,” that is in 1919, to
transport 100,000 Arabs and 40,000 negroes to
France. The committee adds; —
“We are fully confident that the allies of France
would hold the Atlantic open for the transport of
her black legions, and that the French fleet would
be strong enough to hold the Mediterranean.”
The “Allies of France” can only be the British.
In these days, when the Australian daily press is
doing its best, by cooking its cables, to work up an
enthusiasm for the French as against the Germans,
it is just as well that the facts of the case should be
plainlv stated, viz., that, according to all the avail-
able evidence, the French Republic stands for the
colored man and tv. very, and the German Empire for
white men and liberty.
“Button-stick” : To the Hogg person’s de-
mand of the M.L. Commandant, referred to
in The Bulletin (7/9/T1), as to “whether
any scheme of Compulsory service possible
of adoption by the M.L. Government can be
considered adequate compared with the forces
that might be arrayed against it.” I’d like to
yell loud enough to be. heard from here to
Maoriland an emphatic. “Yes.” If all the
material to hand—every able-bodied man
between 18 and 40 —was. well trained, had a
rifle per man and a plentiful supply of am-
munition, Maoriland would be a tough
enough mouthful to make any force think
twice before taking a bite. I know the
country fairly well, and I don’t think I’ve
ever seen one that offered better chances of
defence by a numerically inferior force. It
is a natural fortress from end to end. Any
of the troops who went through the kopje-
climb-and-scrap between Colenso and Lady-
smith know the difficulty of forcing a way
through such country. Wellington, Auck-
land and Christchurch all offer excellent
chances of resisting attack from sea. I don’t
profess to know much about sea-figliting, but
I know that all these places are snugly
planted in positions where a few properly-
constructed forts and modern long-range
guns could give considerable of a Hot Time
to any ships that came near. Certainly the
railways are not too well placed for the
rapid massing of troops to resist a landing
at various points, but neither are they too
good from the. strategical point of view of
the invader, and any he could use have so
many bridges, culverts, etc., that they could
easily be put out of action by the retreating
defenders. There are sheep and cattle
enough in the country to last for an in-
definite time, and these could be driven into
the hills at the back of the defenders, aud
bare grass left for the attackers to feed on.
The chief towns might be occupied by the
enemy for a time, but as long as the Maori-
landers took care not to allow their armies
to be inside when they fell, and left no big
stores of arms or ammunition in them, their
loss would affq’ct the war even less than the
loss of Bloemfontein and Pretoria affected
the Boers.

A branch of the People's party, at Strath-
merton (Vic.) recently' had a shot at for-
mulating a scheme of.'wages and conditions
for farm hands, 'in opposition to the Rural
Workers’ Union schedule. The branch did
very well, so far as the farmer is concerned:
Ordinary farm hands, 20s. per week, and found.
Ploughmen and drill-drivers, 255., and found.
Haymaking hands, 305,, and found.
Binder drivers, 365., and found.
Hours of work: 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., or sunset. The
paddock to be left at 7 p.m. or sunset (whichever is
latest, apparently). Horse drivers to attend to
their horses in their own time.
In the summer, therefore, the driver of a
binder will have to get up at 5 a.m. to feed
his horses and himself, and it will be at
least 8.30 p.m. when he finishes. Allowing 1J
hours for meals, this leaves him 14 hours
work per day—for 65., or slightly less than
sd. per hour. There will probably be a wild
rush of farm-hands to Strathmerton this
harvest-season —if only to hang somebody.
Newcastle’s bubbly old friend, Tommy
Walker, who sat in the N.S.W. Parliament
for years, is among the 10 Laborites to get
into the new Westralian Assembly without
having to fight for it. The Wilson Govern-
ment could muster up pluck enough to go
for only one of the Goldfields seats ; and it
wouldn’t have shown its nose there only it
couldn’t save the political skin of one of its
Ministers any other way. Nowadays, there
are 50 seats in the ’Groper Assembly; and a
crowd that has 10 of them safely in its
pocket can’t complain of the start it gets,
anyway.

The first production of “Carmen” by the
Melba Opera Co., at Her Majesty’s (Syd-
ney), was a brilliantly colored picture of
the tempestuous career of the Spanish
gipsy with a volcano in her temper. Bizet’s
music is a cyclonic mixture of a storm, a
passionate love song, and the tinkle of
guitars. It is a drama m itself, and a per-
fect setting for the whirlwindy “Carmen.”
Eleanora de Cisneros, all thunder and light-
ning, sends Don Jos6-Zieni to blazes in one
of the finest performances of the present
opera season. Vocally, Eleanora-Carmen’s
first warble on Saturday night was not
flawless in its tempo, and Angelini strained
like a greyhound in the leash to get the
voice and the orchestra into a mutual under-
standing. Yet, it was only a small spot on
the brilliant disc of Eleanora’s superb sing-
ing. Zeni, as Don Jose, was rather heavy
in his first scenes with Carmen. His
struggles were the obvious kicks of a fly on
the edge of a treacle tin or a precipice.
After the first act, however, Zeni-Don Jose
not only went to the devil in magnificent
voice, but with a hurricane of dramatic
craft. Eileen Castles, the gentle Micaela of
Saturday’s performance, in spite of nervous-
ness, sang like a bird with a sweet, small
and absolutely true voice that was right on
the spot in every note. Her warble in the
aria (third act) was, vocally, almost fault-
less in its purity of tone. Again, The Bul-
letin hands a posy to Rosina Buckman,
the Mercedes of Carmen. Edmund Burke
was a wooden Escamillo, and sang the
riotous music of the Toreador’s song in a
rich, round voice with the expression of a
lay preacher looking for a job.
Another Unfortunate Alliance: MADAM
BUTTERFLY-WAYDA (Japan) united by
the marriage expert (FRANC HE TTI) to Lieut.
PINKERTON-CICCOLINI(U.S.A.), at Her
Majesty's, Sydney.
To-morrow (Friday) night, “The Waltz
Dream” sways gracefully, melodiously out
of Sydney Royal, giving place to “The
Speckled Band.” The new production is a
dramatic version of one of the Sherlock
Holmes hair-lifters, and the cast will include
Miss Dorothy Dix (a recent import), Wil-
liam Desmond, Cyril Mackay and a live
snake.

“Lady Frederick,” the new show at the
Criterion, is not the work of art that the
writer had been led to expect. It is impos-
sible to accept it as a serious picture of life
anywhere, much less in the Empire’s Smart
Set, which, by all accounts, is not a remark-
ably brainy set, however well-dressed and
sprightly and good-looking and sport-loving
it may be. There are characters in “Lady
Frederick” who get off more bright things
in the course of a couple of days than the
average wit of the iSth century ? (when talf
.mg was an Art) achieved in a year. The
modern society man who, like" Paradine
It ouldes, garnished his every remark with
epigram and paradox and polysyllabic gener-
alisations about late, delivered, a.- it were
from a vast intellectual height, would pro-
bably be expelled from the Smart Set as an
intolerable nuisance and bore, and advised
to get down to his proper level with G L

Society. Lady Frederick Berolles is de-
lightful but quite incredible. Her astound-
ing successes in the matter of pulling
people’s legs are only explicable on the
assumption that her dupes are half-witted.
Consider, for example, the case of the low
comedy dressmaker to whom Lady Frederick
owes £750 odd, and who is abased to the
earth by a little gross flattery and a misty
sort of invitation to lunch with an Arch-
duchess. Assuming this tradeswoman is
completely devoid of intelligence, she
wouldn’t be in the immense way of business
she seemingly is; on the other hand, unless
she is insane she would see right through
Lady Frederick’s audacious blarney, in about
three minutes, and resent it accordingly.
The same objection applies to the scene
where Lord Mereston is cured of his in-
fatuation by the painful spectacle of his
lady-love beautifying herself. Recalling the
frantic efforts of his mother, to estrange him
from Lady Frederick, and other things, the
nobleman would be idiotic, indeed if be
failed to grasp the inner meaning of the
gratuitous show. David Garrick’s disil-
lusioning of his adorer was a convincing bit
of self-degradation, inasmuch as, 150 years
ago, it was customary for men to get up-
roariously drunk in society. But tne day
has not dawned, nor is ever likely to, when
women will, with no ulterior object, reveal
the subterranean mysteries of the toilet to
their admirers. The name-part is palpably
written up with an eye to Miss Irving or
someone like her. The comic underplot has
no more relation to tne play proper than if
the latter were a melodrama. The Jew mil-
lionaire is too maladroit to be true. Yet,
with all its defects, “Lady Frederick” sup-
plies a glorious evening’s entertainment.
One explanation is that it provides Miss
Ethel Irving with an opportunity to run
the entire gamut of those essentially femin-
ine emotions whicn she has a'peculiar genius
for portraying. She is alternately gay, de-
jected, pleased, disgusted, lachrymose, tender,
exasperated, yielding, defiant; and each
phase is expressed with the utmost charm
and the most restrained and natural art.
Stephen Ewart makes the stupendous Para-
dine Fouldes almost human, a fine feat con-
sidering the artificiality of the character.
Halliwell Hobbes, by studious underplay,
tones down the crude speeches which the
author has put into the mouth of Captain
Montgomery. Warburton Gamble plays the
difficult part of Lord Mereston with ease
and skill: and the portrait of his mother
(except that the matron doesn’t look an
hour over 30) is a credit to Miss Violet
Ley. The subsidiary roles are as well
handled as they deserve, though the blatapcy
of the dressmaker is over-stressed by J|iss
Nelson, and Gilbert Porteous’s boisterous
stage-admiral (in a make-up which more
suggests a poodle than a sea-dog) is some-
what out of the reposeful picture.

“Nobody’s Daughter” continues to win
everybody’s adoration at the Palace. There
is a wealth of striking and original thought
in this play. F’rinstance, among the theatri-
cal advts. of an abandoned Sydney daily, the
other day, the writer happened upon the fol-
lowing (heavily underlined it was, and over
against it, on the margin, were the word's,
“How True!”) :

with J.C.W. C. R. Stanford is the only
member of the original company in the cast,
and he still carries a heavy bundle as Peter
Schwartz, Dutch janitor and henpecked hus-
band. The Tin Can Band is there in all its
noisiness. Vera Spaull makes a delightfully
natural Little Mother. Cecil Mannering and
Roland Riley do pretty well in the struggle
to give life to Howard Wilson, the wealthy
clubman, and Robert Curtis, the man about
town, who takes to drink and gives the plans
of the bad woman away. Ada Guildford, the
bad woman who likes wrecking happy homes,
and Ida Gresham, the wronged wife of
Howard whose home is wrecked, also get one
good mark each.

The picture show may be strong enough to
pull the crowd in single harness, but it
seems significant that one after another of
the “palaces” are ;offering the horse a lift
at the wheel. Spencer’s (Sydney) are the
latest to add music to the films, their attrac-
tion being the Windsor Choristers, including
James lies, a boy soprano. The interesting
little crowd croons such sweet things as
“When They Ask You What Your Name
Is” and “Love Me and the World is Mine,”
along with Jude’s old “Home, Boys, Home,”
which sounds like a cabby’s midnight instruc-
tions, but isn’t. There is a good programme
of pictures, some .of which, however, were
delayed by the sluggish arrival of this week’s
English mail, and started to whiz a day
late.

The Tivoli last week acquired 'lie Kas-
racs, a mixed team of four acrobats who
throw*’ one another about without injury.
They should be hired to instruct some mem-
bers of the Ma State Assembly and the
Sergeant-at-Arms how to transform a dull,
scrambling and objectionable removal from
the Chamber into a bright and entertaining
spectacle. As soon as Stage Manager Willis
gave the cue, “Sergeant, remove the Honor-
able Member for Blither!” both performers
would spring out of their seats, bow grace-
fully, and, after whirling each other round
several times, would clasp arms affection-
ately and roll rapidly across the carpet and
out through the swing doors, in the manner
of a whirling Chinese puzzle. Clark and
Hamilton, purveyors of gay nonsense, Com-
edian Fred Bluett and McLallen and Carson,
the roller-skating pair, are other valuable
prograihme assets. Harry Allister, the
serious character impersonator, has added
the picturesque ’Enry Parkes to his portrait
gallery, and the eminent whiskers of the Past
■wave boldly across the footlights like the
banners of old Romance —or words to that
effect.

Clement Wragge has packed up his ex-
traordinary collection of stars, sun-spots,

Wrighton, the really humorous entertainers
who have been amusing the suburban popu-
lation for a few weeks, will return for a
farewell season.

After a remarkably successful revival of
“The Arcadians,” at the Adelaide Royal,
Tom Walls (who has done a little real race-
riding in the intervals of being Peter
Doody), Gertrude Gilliam, and the rest,
have assumed the voluminous trousers and
petticoats of Holland, where the Hooks come
from. The Tivoli has a strong bill, with the
accent on the musical side: Lamberti, Alex.
Prince, Albert Rees, who “entertains,” and
Margaret Ismay and her girls; also, Spissell
commits assault and battery on Mack, and
Jerry, the image, is disrespectful to Carlton
Max". The King’s nas introduced a quaint
act called “Whizzing the Whirl.” It is a
sort of pillow-fight, and the audience can
join in. Toby Claude is singing her rather
heavily-peppered songs, and Walker and
Scott do high-wire balancing.
** * *
“The Chocolate Soldier,” at Melbourne
Royal, is as it was in the beginning. The
competent understudies are resting on their
laurels, whilst Miss O’Connor and Gaze are
back-in their places. Noel Flemming con-
tinues to spread himself on his announce-
ments' of the things he never does, and the
I’opoffs and Mascha join as usual in the
social disturbance which excites the Bul-
garian chorus to tuneful fury.
“The Lyons Mail,” at Her Majesty’s (Mel-
bourne), is a mediocre play, with some ex-
cellent melodramatic properties, and one
large opportunity. H. B. Irving having
made a one-part play of “Hamlet,” it was
to be expected that he would absorb public
attention in this elderly French device, the
motive of which is essentially the conception
of “Jekyll and Hyde.” The fact that Ste-
phenson crowds his opposing personalities
into one hide, does not alter the dramatic
case. It is merely a matter of closer settle-
ment. LI. B. Irving is somewhat inconse-
quential as Lesurques, and interesting as
Dubose, without giving anything more than
a surface impression of a dangerous maniac
with the rum habit. Whatever Irving’s
Hamlet may have been, there’s no doubt his
Dubose is insane. The impression created
is not such as would be inspired by the con-
duct of an unscrupulous sc-’mp with a sar-
donic vein and a certain cut-throat humor,
but is the effect one might get from watching
the caperings of a humorous homicidal idiot
through asylum bars. The two low-comedy
blackguards, Choppard and Foumard, are
workman-like exhibits, for which Arthur
Whitby and Tom Reynolds are responsible.
The smaller and grimier villain is particu-
larly bright. Courriol is passably done, but
a bunch of Irving’s young men are nervous
and fidgety, and cannot occupy stage space
ia a scene without damaging the general
effect. Miss Irene Browne is satisfactory
as Julie, which, however, is merely a nice-
looking part. Dorothea Baird re-introduces
her Botticelli effects as Jeannette, but more
markedly as Mary Cave, in the curtain-
raiser, “A Maid of Honor,” a part which
she plays with an obvious and persistent
nerve strain. “The Lyons Mail” is for one
week only. On Saturday next, “The Bells”
will ring furiously.
KA UFMANN (Basso) and ZEN I (Tenor)
of the Melba Opera Co. Drawn by Zeni.
The failure of “The Lady of the Pluck
Up,” at the Princess’s, on its all-important
first night, proves nothing against the author
except that he still lacks a sense of propor-
tion. Randolph Bedford, ere this, should
have been hailed as the bald-headed father of
Australian .literary melodrama, and the dis-
tinction remains open to him. The “Pluck
Up,” with a story running on broad, safe
lines, shows his improved sense of how to
make a combination of • characters strong-
enough to hold the attention of the audience,
whilst carrying a slender plot to a common-
place finale. Says the programme :
The action of the play is placed at Pluckup Silver
Mining Camp, Barrier Ranges' (N.S.W.), and extends
over three months. Period. 1884.
The discovery of silver at Broken Hill is the
cause ; the characters are the effect. When
the effect is painfully weak, the fault is
almost invariably in the performance. In
the casting of the women parts, and in the
construction of one of them, Randolph Bed-
ford reveais the weak spot in his otherwise
sturdy mental equipment. Not having culti-
vated the faculty of humorously estimating
the relative values of things, he cannot see
at a glance the difference between foolishness
that is passable on the stage, and absurdity
that isn’t.
The story depends for sentimental interest
—and no mining melodrama can live without
that —on the personality of the name-part
player. The leading )ndv must be youthfully
charming in face, figure and style, tenderly
sympathetic in speech, and quite exotic and
spiritual as compared with (say) Tittell
Brune’s “Sunday,” although equally able to
strike an attitude of indignation. Miss Mary
Herries is none of these things, nor can she
act well enough to create an illusion. Yet
the part, in the hands of a graceful, soft-
spoken young novice, such as Mrs. Maesmore
Morris was of yore., would sufficiently play
itself. Miss Le Croisette, in the more diffi-
cult character of an inconsistent tow-haired
Maudie of the bar, burlesques it out of all
semblance of humanity, even when she might
be easily true to life. Against these draw-
backs, the acting of the mqn availeth not.
Kenneth Brampton is an earnest, manly
hero. Bryant, Greig, Harry Neville and
others are convincing types of “Pluck Up”
civilisation, and Diver is only a little too
intensely melodramatic as the one bad man
in the crowd. The mild old innocent who
is saved from selling a 14th part of Broken
Hill for £5O might be improved upon, but
he is not a conspicuous blot on the land-
scape. The scenery, by Grist, is a pub most
of the time, but thei’e is an effective land-
scape in the third act. Also, an occasional
coach and four adds local color to this ill-
used drama of real Australian material and
manufacture.

At the King’s, there is no slackening of

Nicola, a wizard from the land of the
Beef Trust and Ella Wheeler Wilcox, trans-
pired at the Athenaeum Hall, on Saturday
last. The Yankee has a nonchalant man-
ner, a certain crude, dry humor, and a slick,
clean style in getting through his tricks;
making up in skill wliat he lacks in origin-
ality. A number of old, and a few new, de-
ceptions are perpetrated with the aid of
several cabinets, divers hats, “a pack of
ordinary playing cards,” two girls, some
public-spirited citizens from the front stalls,
and the other ancient prons which have been
the stock-in-trade of princes, kings and blokes
of magic since time immemorial. At a late
stage of the proceedings Nicola permits him-
self to be fastened up with tangible pieces of
ironmongery, and retires to a cabinet what
time the orchestra makes noises remindful
of Mary Gibbs. After a space Nick emerges
with the handcuffs, etc., in his hand, and a
broad smile on his physiognomy. A clown
who pervades the whole of the programme
is rather less amusing than Mr. Bruce Smith.
Fern and Mack, billed as “comic gymnasts,”
perform some fakes of strength, with the aid
of a wire which is not nearly as invisible as
it might be. For the rest, there are Nadolny,
a juggler, and two nice-looking girls who as-
sist the “star,” and about whom this paper
does not propose to say anything unkind.

“Her Sacrifice,” running at WesPs
(Melb.), on Saturday last, looked like a bit
of “Camille” photographed in Mexican
scenerv. In plot, it was only a poor rela-
tion of Dumas’s drama; but it was bright-
ened by plenty of eye and dagger play. A
surprising film was “Forgiven In Death,”
which began with a scene of rural peace, and
ended by dotting the screen with human re-
mains.

Appearing at the P’ran Lyric (Vic.), last
week, was “The Gunfighter,” a drama packed
with Injuns, cowboys, and disorderly con-
duct. Most of the trouble is caused by a
desperado carrying gun-practice to the verge
of ostentation. Of other films shown, the
most amazing was “The Ends of The
Earth.” Herein a hubby is driven, annoyed
by his wife’s indifference, to the Frozen
North, whither the remorseful matron chases
him. Their reunion in the snow occurs as a
matter of course.

The very latest comers at the Opera House
are a lady, described as the Dapper Dandy
Bov, who has to be taken serio-comically,
and an unaccountable burlesque acrobat,
clothed in conventional pants and _ shirt-
sleeves, whose nom-de-frivol is Ridiculous
Recco. Recco claims to have had the honor
of appearing ridiculous four _ times before
the King and Queen of Spain, in 1910, since
when popular feeling against the monarchy
lias been rising higher. Sam Mayo hap-
pened at the Opera House in the beginning
of last week, and is now a comparatively
old attraction. It must be grudgingly ad-
mitted that Samuel is amusing in a way. He
wears a dismal dressing-gown, and a doleful
expression, and he crouches like a child suf-
fering from colic whilst he croaks . verses
to the congregation. If he can sing or
dance, or both, he is concealing those ac-
complishments at present. He merely croaks
in a dressing-gown, and is said to have been
preceded in this country by an imitator who
was not so funny. May the Lord forgive
that imitator! Binns and Binns are firmly
established on the bill,' and the beauty ot
Alcide Capitaine’s gymnastic exercises is a
joy until further notice.
“A.E.M.’: Australia already possesses Kelly,
the Bft. Irishman; also Hayati Hassid, a 3ft. J m'k,
who is to be Gaud Mayor of an impending herd of
midgets. Rosa and Josefa Blazek, the Hungarian
twins, who are joined at the hip, are approaching us
from Hamburg. A lady with real whiskers is on her
wav and another ladv who is half a gentleman is
expected at any moment. And yet there are chronic
moaners, who wail that Art in Australia is at a low
ebb! *
“Motley”: With Wirths’ new show, which opens
at their Melbourne Hippodrome on- Caulfield Cup
night, there are, x see, “the 11 Bastrens, equestrian
acrobats, from the Circus Schumann, Berlin. Ihe
line sets the memory groning back in the sawdust.
This Schumann visited Australia as Husband of \ ic-
toria Cooke, the equestrienne, about whom there was
a precious row in Calcutta, after the proclamation of
Queen Victoria as Empress of India. For that great
Delhi Durbar, at which Titheradge read the procla-
mation, Vicerov Lvtton had a number of medals
struck off. After all the Indian potentates had got
one apiece, there were some .left over. Lytton, won-
dering' what to do with them, was seized with a urii-
liant idea. On one of them he had “Victoria, Em*
press of India” obliterated, and “Victoria Cooke,
Empress of the Arena,” inscribed instead. She was
at the time the star of Wilson’s circus, then perform-
ing on the Calcutta Maidan, before it came on to
Sydney. \ iceroy Lvtton descended into the ring one
night and presented the precious medal along with
a glowing speech. The indignation among the Indian
princes was hot enough to make the Ganges boil, and
some of them threatened to fling away their baubles.
Yates of the London World, got hold 1 of the affair,
and held Lytton up to ridicule, and his star set
right then.
AT POVERTY POINT.
The lunch-hour organ recitals at Melbourne Town
Hall, which happen twice a week, supply a want-
free of charge—to city clerks who are off the chain
between 1.15 and 1.45. Also, they advertise the
fact that the Town Hall organ, reconstructed a few
years ago, is a highly respectable instrument, and
that Dr. Price can get some fine effects in popular
classical music from it. The audiences are partly
permanent and partly shifting. Many of the young
fellows who drop in for 10 minutes or so before
getting back to the desk or the shop, had no pre-
vious knowledge of a modern organ’s resources, nor
wore they aware of their capacity for applauding a
Wagner item. Thus, Price, with his organ recitals,
is something of a recruiting sergeant for the little
army of music-lovers. The recruits are raw, but
they look likely to be licked into shape.
“Cockaigne”: Miss Eastlake, just dead at 56,
was Barrett’s leading lady in “The Lights o’ Lon-
don,” “Romany Rye,” “Silver King,” “Claudian,”
and other productions, with Willard as the villain.
The quartette of Wilson Barrett, Willard, George
Barrett, and Eastlake could never be equalled by
Barrett’s rival Terriss with his support. Yet, Terriss
was better than Barrett; and George Rignold was
better than either.
Adelaide is to have a new theatre. Harold
Ashton, on behalf of J.C.W., Ltd., has bought a
block of land at the corner of North Terrace and
Victoria-street, opposite Parliament House and the
railway station, and thereon the co. is going to
build the customary “best theatre in Australia,” to
seat 3000 people.
Miss Eastlake, who had been insane for nearly 20
years, died the other week, aged 56. She was the
luckiest melodrama actress of her time, playing
leading lady parts with Wilson Barrett whilst he
was exploiting “Lights o’ London” and subsequent
money-making plays. Miss Eastlake “created” the
character of Nellie Denver in “Silver King,” and did
it very well in her angular, emotional way.
From Edwin Geach: “Cassandra” (B. 21/9/’ll)
is surely in real life either the president of the Ice
Carters’ Association or the Pessimists’ Club. Already
he is preparing to hold a post-mortem on the picture-
show business, the decay of which he asserts has
already begun. As a matter of fact, nothing could
be wider of the mark. Before the introduction of
the picture-show it was estimated that, roughly, only
25 per cent, of the population attended entertain-
ments of any kind ; some kept away on account of
religious scruples, and others because they could not
bring the youngsters with them. To-day it is esti-
mated that fully 95 per cent, seek rational enjoy-
ment in theatres and picture-halls. Cut out the
latter, and what is to happen to those who have a
prejudice against the music-hall and the home of the
drama? Will they be content with the Optimists’
Club, or will they, like “Cassandra,” who has taken
to betting, indulge in more harmful pastimes? It
may be taken for granted that as yet the picture-
show is in its infancy. [The Bulletin isn’t taking
any hand in this controversy. It is merely reminded
of something. Last week it saw a shabby old man
doddering along the street. His face looked familiar,
and presently this paper recollected. He was a once
hefty speculator, who declared, in 1891, that the
land boom was only in its infancy. There is no
more connection between this event and the picture-
show business than there is between a giraffe and
the Norman Conquest. The item is merely put in to
fill up space.]
“Sr ”: The lamentable First Part has been struck
in the stomach by the axe of Progress at Hobart —-
the very last place where one would expect to find
the axe of Progress striking any stomach. Brennan’s
show used to include all the old stand-byes—the four
blackened minstrels, each with a fruity voice and
the Jenolan Cave for a mouth; the evening-dressed
and well-fed interlocutor; the serio-chronic; the
dashing soubrette in a short frock who sings about
Bertie; the stout tenor; the basso tremendioso;
and the rest. They have all been obliterated into
outer darkness. The First Part is now part of the
Second Part, and the Second Part is that part of
the Second Part which hasn’t become part of the
First Part. And the change appears to work all
right.
Pathfi’s “Australia at Work” picture-show has
just completed a remarkable tour in Victoria. M.
P. Adams ran it for more than 300 consecutive
nights without a pause, the 300-odd displays being
distributed among 250 towns and townships, after
Melbourne and suburbs had been exploited. A
similar tour, with a new assortment of industries,
is being arranged for N.S.W.
Taits have got the Australian rights of the
Kinema color-process in picture work. They will
introduce it at Melbourne at the Glaciarium when
they resume possession in October, and thereby
settle the vexed question whether Kinema color films
now faithfully reproduce the actual appearance of
things, or continue to confuse the tints as they did
when the process was in its infancy.
“The Combine’s” first panto, will be “Sinbad the
Sailor.” It is under weigh now.
STAGGERGRAMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The popularity of moving pictures has greatly
diminished the number of theatrical companies visit-
ing the smaller centres of the Dominion —Press item.
Oh, for the rant of a bellowdrama,
For the virtuous tears of the injured wife,
For the villain dark, who fain would damn a
Hero’s joy with a carving knife,
For the rolling R’s, and the good stage thunder,
And the hansom cab, and the baby’s pram.,
And the glitter and gore and shouts and wonder
That have yielded place to the flickergram.
They are seen no more, and we miss them badly,
While the endles pictures come and go,
And the sprinting corpses chase us sadly
Through the flickering streets of the endless show.
Up and down and around they stagger,
And we wonder what it is all about,
While we sigh for the roar and rant and swagger
Of the good old mimes that are all knocked out.
Concert companies still can find us,
Or a fiddler fiddles the livelong night;
Or raging amateur shows remind us
Of the stirring hours of our lost delight.
But the pictures come, and the pictures flicker,
And the gaff that we loved no more is seen,
And it seems that the world has all got shicker
From the staggergram on the jiggering screen.

ANOTHER STORY.
H IM: “Don't I give you
all the money you need?”
H ER: “ Perhaps. But not
all that I want."
“Brass Button” : The N.S.W. North Coast
steamer Rosedale takes up the cry of the
Yongala for an Act compelling all pas-
senger ships to carry “wireless.” It is sinful
that good lives should be lost for the lack of
such a cheap and easily rigged arrangement.
The “wifeless” might not save the ship; but
even if the vessel sunk before assistance
could reach it, it is long odds that some of
the passengers and crew would be floating
round on gratings and fittings for hours
after the final plunge. If a call for help
were “wirelessed,” search boats would be able
to steam straight to the scene, and might
rescue some of the floaters before cold and
exposure chilled thepi into throwing up the
sponge. And in the regular traffic-lanes
round the Coast, there is a good chance of a
message being caught by a steamer near
enough to make a sprint and get in even be-
fore the dike, or very soon after it. Which
is another strong argument in favor of com-
pulsory sparks where voluntary ones are
hanging fire.
The 34-year-old coasting steamer, Rose-
dale, which disappeared with all hands in
the southerly gale which raced up the
N.S.W. coast at the end of last week, has been
affectionately compared, by a former com-
mander, to a faithful horse. The chief differ-
ence between a horse and a ship is that,
when a horse gets old, there is no way of
repairing him and sending him out to face
the same big fences that he flew gaily in his
youth. An old ship, on the other hand, may
have an artificial youth or second child-
hood. Its steel muscles, sinews and skin can
be renewed in dock. Still, ships will persist
in aging despite the shipwrights. The Rose-
dale had been steeplechasing for a long, long
time, and had suffered a couple of bad falls.
The last accident happened early this year,
when the "patriarchal craft got a tremendous
pounding at the Bellinger River. The sal-
vage job by which it was preserved for the
final tragedy was reckoned to be one of the
finest ever done in these parts. It was
dragged from its resting-place, repaired and
entered for all open sea events as if it were
a fresh young salt colt. The Rosedale ran
well and faithfully until the disturbance of
a few days ago. Then the straggling field
of coasters Weighed in one short. No sea-
faring person seems to have a satisfactory
explanation of the disaster about him. The
only outstanding facts appear to be that the
Rosedale was a venerable steamer, that the
marine fences are as high and as stiff as
they were in the days of Noah, and that
David Jones is as young and boisterous as
ever. Jones never seems to lose his punch.
“Early Riser” writes :
The S.A. Labor party is wroth with the Verran
Government tor proposing to bring out immigrants,
either men or women. Yet domestic help is practi-
cally unget.table in Adelaide, except at famine prices,
and the wives of the working men are the chief
sufferers, for they cannot get assistance, even in the
greatest emergencies. Meanwhile, women in Eng-
land are doing casual domestic work at Is. a day,
without meals, while girls hire themselves out there
for ss. a week.

“Te Babarantiko’s” tribute to his shirt-
tail crew
We were working the
coast of India, collecting
cargoes for a Parsee mer-
chant, with about 50 nigger
lumpers—men, women and
children. We never ex-
pected much from them or
the spindle-shanked crew, and
the first emergency did not
disappoint us. One thick,
rainy night, just before eight
bells, as, according to cus-
tum, I gave a pull on the
braces, there was a roar, and
over the hooker went, taken
flat aback in a squall. We
were under easy sail, show-
ing nothing above the ’gal-
lant crosstrees; and the flying
jib was stowed. By the ac-
companying flash of light-
ning I saw the jibboom
snap off, and come up on
what had been the weather
side with two jibs stand-
ing; also I saw the two
lookout men petrified with
horror. Then the darkness
shut them out. Just pre-
viously the decks had
been filled with shirt-tails,
yet in that moment, every-
one had disappeared. A
short but energetic search
failed to locate any in
the dark, and loving en-
treaties to them to come
out were equally futile.
Fortunately the squall was
short; nevertheless we three
whites had a pretty strenuous
half-hour getting the vessel’s
head up before we could
respond to the “old man’s’’
soul-stirring apepal to “Get
some of the rice-eating black
swine out if you have to
kick their backbones through
their skulls! ” In the ’tween
decks a pair of lean shanks
showed from behind a beef-
cask, and a hearty yank
dislodged the chief serang.
Finding he was not dead,
biit likely to die soon
if he failed to get a
move on, he gradually routed out the other rats, and
we belted them into clearing ship. Something of
that sort has been my experience on every similar
occasion, and thg blasphemy of other British officers
in relating their experiences satisfies me that the
complaint is general. That is why I shall be able
to read the news of the awful doings aboard a big
P. and 0. or British-India liner any day without
being unduly surprised.

“J.G.” (from Victoria) Quite agree with
The Bulletin (7/9/T1) as to the great
urgency of tossing our whole political and
municipal fabric into the melting-pot, and
building a big bonfire under it. If’instance,
I live in the parish of Wallan Wallan. My
mails are posted and received at the Wallan
East post office, and the railway station op-
posite the post office is the Wallan station.
My name is on the ratepayers’ list of the
Shire of Merriang ; upon the State electoral
roll for the electorate of Bulla; and on the
Federal roll for Mernda. I am in the police
district of Wallan, but have to go to Kil-
more to get fined the usual 5s. or 24 hours,
when recovering from a jag. If I want to
rent a pub. I have to apply to the Broad-
meadows Clerk of Courts for the necessary
license. If I want to go mining I have to
apply to the Bendigo mining district for a
miner’s right. I am in the Broadmeadows
division of Bulla, in the County of Bourke,
and in the Seymour division of the Federal
electorate of Mernda. * My kids have to go
to the Upper Plenty State School, whilst the
boys will have to attend military drill in
the Moonee Ponds area. If I want water
laid on to my humpy, I have to apply to the
Kilmore Waterworks Trust. I am a few
other districts and divisions of various sorts,
but the above list is enough to go on with.

“Field-Marshal”: The aeroplane is going
to make the battle of the future a short,
straight-ahead function. During the recent
German manoeuvres, the birds of petrol are
said to have collected in 35 minutes, infor-
mation which would have taken a strong
force of cavalry four hours to obtain. The
Lancers, Dragoons and Hussars, who have
hitherto had the job of locating the enemy,
are overbearing persons in hysterical clothes,
with spikes on their heels and the upholstery
of bears on their heads. The Life Guards'-
men, who occasionally assist, are even worse,
for they are partly canned, and, when on
parade, bear a strong family resemblance to
a consignment of tinned beer before it is
labelled. Ft is generally understood that the
cavalrymen have been privileged to look
down on the soberly-garbed multitude be-
cause they did all the scouting and rode into
the frequently toothless jaws of Death in
search of information. If the sputtering sky
machine helps to moderate the swagger of
the overdressed horse chauffeurs, I will shout
the first ’plane I meet a pint of foaming
gasolene.
The N. S. Wales Health Department has
found the “guaranteed pure” swindle too big
to overcome, for the present, anyhow. Up
till recently, the department had sought to
make it a sine qua non that the label,
“guaranteed pure,” should carry an actual
guarantee under the State Pure Food Act as
to the quality of the article to which it was
attached. But thereabouts it was discovered,
as usual, that many imported goods bearing
the legend “guaranteed pure” were not up
to the standards required by the local de-
partment ; in fact, that some of them ought
to be labelled, “guaranteed cronk.' Never-
theless, when the department learned how
expensive it would be to the poor oppressed
importer to obliterate the words, “guaran-
teed pure,” it gave way, and now the guar-
antee which is not a guarantee at all but a
plain, common or unscriptural take-down,
may roam at large and do its worst. And
about the only way to avoid the worst is to
insist on getting home-manufactured goods
all the time and every time.
Colonel Roth, who with a sword in his
hand and a wall to his back, could hold off
probably any dozen other doctors in Sydney,
has been pricking another blister on Aus-
tralia’s reputation. The lean, lank Austra-
lian, in the raw state, hasn’t much of a
“chest,” and the “expert” who reckons him
up by European text-book standards rushes
off, as a rule, to some medical congress or
Tory conference, and pours out a jeremiad
about “the decadence of the Australian.’’
Roth, however, who knows what the long
but narrow-chested Australian can do,
bulges out his own front until it shows an
expansion of 6in., and then says “Pooh!” to
the performance, and declares it mere knack.
“I’ll put an inch on any man in a month.”
he says, and infers that the man wouldn’t
be any the better for it. Roth says the aver-
age chest expansion of the Sydney fire-
brigade men isn’t more than 3in.; and yet
there are few finer bodies on this small
planet.

£10,000 is required for an endowment. I have
been promised £6600. Will any of your readers
help towards the balance?
Why England should be asked to subscribe
some £3000 odd for the supply of religion to
the place where the “richest square mile in
the world” resides, is baffling to the non-
religious mind. By the way, Canada has
already leapt heavily on this discreditable
practice of cadging for church purposes in
foreign parts, as though those cadged for
were cannibal islanders. Is the Australian
any less self-respecting than the Canuck.''

it appears that an Opposition of fO members in a

against the Speaker’s efforts at suppression, is to
count for nothing. — S. M. Herald, on the recent

Professor William Salmond, of the Otago
(M.L.) University, who recently stated in
the Loanly Isles that Prohibition was a
quack remedy, and that intemperance would
never be cured by drastic compulsory legis-
lation. has since replied to the infuriated
howls that descended upon his argument.
Asked why he and others like him were op-
posed to the schemes of the Raspberry Fizz
cranks, he remarked, amongst other things:
We do not wish to see the country flooded with
falsehood, perjury, moral cowardice and duplicity,
such as are inevitably called forth by laws which
are too repressive and run a-tilt against common
human nature, and convert innocent acts into crime.
We fear the creation of a moral pestilence walking
in darkness, in truth, worse than the destruction that
wasteth at noonday. We shrink with becoming dis-
like from the introduction of a regime that will in-
flict, a feeling of humiliation on the greater part of
the manhood of the land, by bringing them under a
moral tutelage fit only for children and savages.
To this the anti-liquor party has replied that
there is no proof that “emotional” legisla-
tion has always failed and always will fail in
M.L. Which leads The Bulletin to sug-
gest that, if the cranks will despatch a real,
hard-doer into the drv districts of their coun-
try, and pay all expenses, he will return in
10 days with a collection of horn-back centi-
pedes and illuminated snakes that will defin-
itely close the argument.
If circumstances don’t make a brick for
the S. M. Herald to throw at Australia,
that malignant anti-Australian goes into the
brick-making industry itself. One day last
week its London correspondent sent an
article on the great strike in England. In-
cidentally, he remarked: —
It is highly interesting to an Australian to see the
workers in England being led, in this case undoubt-
edly with success, by men whom Australian workers
have rejected. The reason why Australia rejected
Mr. Tom Mann was that Australian workers have so
important a share in political control that they can
carry through their objects without recourse to such
a hopelessly ponderous and wasteful method as a
general strike. The English working man does not
yet possess political control; and such measures of
reform as the Radiea_ Government has undertaken
on its behalf have habitually been emasculated or re-
jected by the House of Lords.
But while the London correspondent threw
the,brick at the House of Lords, the dread-
ful anti-Australian Herald headed the
article, “The Great Strike: Mobs and Ball
Cartridge. Australian Agitators in the
Field”—the “Australian agitators” being
the English Tom Mann whom, on the Her-
ald’s own showing, “the Australian workers
had rejected.”

The decorating habit has grown on Australia to
such an extent that the country now requires next
to no provocation to hang flags along the principal
thoroughfares, erect triumphal arches, and obscure its
statues by sticking flagpoles round them. The evil
dates from the rags-and-tatters orgy that flapped
round George of York and his consort May in the early
days of the Commonwealth. Previous to that time,
public rejoicings were marked by a decent restraint
in the matter of bunting; when a man wisneu 10

indicate that he was loyal, or drunk, or getting
married, or feeling sorry that someone was dead, he
ran up a flag on the pole over his warehouse or shop,
and let it go at that. In those times, a thorough-
fare like Collins-street, in Melbourne, made a pretty
and dignified show. The long, irregular lines of
flags seen against a blue sky were just sufficient to
relieve the sombreness of the buildings, and give the
boulevard a holiday appearance. Nowadays, the
fashion is to break the expensive wood blocks, and
erect Venetian masts; to blot out statuary with
greenery, flags, and poles ; to wrap buildings in
strips of violently-colored rags, and to put up trium-
phal marble arches made of plaster. These are the
four main sins- of an Australian celebration, and the
plaster arch insult is about the most rancid of the
quartette. Other outrages against common sense and
art are devised for private individuals and firms—
but more particularly by ingenious drapers and ware-
housemen to whom rags are no object. The faded
decoration or drape usually serves some base use
when the days of mourning or rejoicing are over.
When Queen Victoria died, Melbourne tied crape
and other black substances all over itself and
mourned hard for about one calendar week. Then
the pictures of “our late beloved Queen” were taken
out of 10,000 shop windows, and the shop boys used
the outward signs of grief wherewith to dust the
counter, polish the stock and clean the front win-
dow. Present scribe was in a bicycle shop in those
days, and has a distinct recollection of seeing a new
racing machine, wrapped in crape, being led down
the street towards the railway station by a grimy
small boy. The owner of the thing wasn’t dead, and
the small boy didn’t constitute a unit in a funeral
procession; it was merely the last of our national
mourning being used up.
While the wrangle goes on in the Medical
Congress and elsewhere concerning the rela-
tion of the State to the hospitals, the
Sydney institutions are rapidly near-
ing the point where they can go on
no farther unless carried bodily by
the Government. Recently the di-
rectors of Prince Alfred Hospital
waited on Acting Chief Secretary
Flowers and presented him with the
choice of handing the institution a
cheque for £5OOO or taking the blame
of closing 100 occupied beds and
throwing out 100 patients. Mean-
time, Sydney Hospital is getting
ready to celebrate its 100th birth-
day (October 30) with a big art
union, and hopes to dredge sufficient
from the gambling instincts of the
public to kick the wolf backwards as
far as the front gate. Unfortu-
nately, the animal will not remain
there, let alone go away and chew
his head off, under the present sys-
tem of precarious upkeep by cadging
round with the hat. The sooner the
Government places the hospitals in
the State under the management of
the State the quicker will Socialism
once more show the way to Private Muddle-
ism.
A sale of slum —or, at least, slummy—
property was held last week in Melbourne,
when some of the oldest lane and alley resi-
dences adjoining Latrobe, Little Lonsdale
and Exhibition streets were auctioned. At
that sale all local Asia seemed to have
gathered—Chow, Hindu, Syrian, Arab and
miscellaneous. Asia had dwelt, for many
years, in these crowded back lanes, and loved
them; and when the property came into the
market he rolled up to buy each man his own
blessed hovel so that he might be safe
against disturbance. The fear that they
might be driven out —that their, cherished
smells might be dug up and shifted, and
their aged mouldiness scattered to the four
winds—maddened the aliens, and , they paid
wonderful prices. It was a most successful
sale, and 12 different kinds of undesirable
were said to be among the purchasers.
Those who form their estimate of the
N.S.W. Assembly by what they read in the
Sydney morning papers are not to blame
if they regard Speaker Willis as a demented
person who habitually bites an inoffensive
Opposition out of sheer wantoness. Wood
(in whom, as a result of years of license,
insulting Parliamentary behavior has be-
come a chronic habit, like beer-snatching
or drug-taking) was bumped along the usual
path the other night, and the Herald and
Telegraph supported his contention that he
had created no disorder, insulted neither the
Speaker nor the House, and generally com-
ported himself like a model Parliamentarian
and gentleman. However, the Evening
News came out, 12 hours later, with this: —
Mr. Beeby had moved that the consideration of the
Bill be an order of the day for the morrow.
Mr. Wood rose and proceeded to make a speech.
The Speaker asked him to resume his seat, the
motion being purely formal.
Mr. Wood: Everything’s formal in this House now.
Mr. Willis again called Mr. Wood to order, re-
marking that it was the second time he had had to
speak to the member for Bega.
Mr. Wood: “I don’t care if it is the fourth,” and
continuing to make asides in spite of the Speaker’s
injunctions, the latter ordered the sergeant to remove
him.
Mr. Wood, not exactly resisting, but leaning back
to delay his departure till he had had his say, said,
as the sergeant propelled him gently but firmly,
“I’m glad to be put out by a man like you” (ap-
parently addressing the Speaker)—“you’ll get tired
of putting me out.”
Looking angrily across at the Government Benches,
the member for Bega said, “Oh, you can lookl” He
was still speaking as he disappeared from the sight
of the gallery.
In short, either the Herald and Telegraph
deceived their readers, as regards Wood’s in-
offensiveness, or the News cruelly libelled
one of the leaders of the party it supports.
THE SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST.
How wise Australia was in refusing to
accept a mad Belgian from the Finnish sail-
ing ship Finland, last January, appears from
the sequel. He looked all right when at
Port Victor (S.A.), but the captain—who
presumably knew him best —kept him in
irons, and the Commonwealth would have
none of him. Bristol (England) papers now
complacently report that he has been
“brought to Bristol and handed over to the
local asylum authorities,” after terrorising
the whole ship on the voyage back. Poor old
Mother seems to be the dumping-ground for
all kinds of foreign rubbish nowadays.
Four seamen were charged in a Sydney
police court, the other day, with deserting
the Britisn ship Lauderdale. Their defence
was that the vessel left Port Huon (Tas-
mania) in an unseaworthy condition, inas-
much as, having no tarpaulins over its
hatches, Neptune would be able to empty
slops into the holds ad lib. After hearing
evidence, the magistrate agreed with the sea-
men that the vessel they had bolted from in
affright was not seaworthy, dismissed the
charges against them with costs, and ordered
their arrears of wages to be paid. The Tas-
manian Marine Board, which allowed the
Lauderdale to go to sea in the state com-
plained of, was fined two months hard labor,
or, rather, that is what it appears to de-
serve.
The Barrack-street, Sydney, Savings Bank
which is uproariously resenting amalgama-
tion with the Government Savings Bank, got
a bad advt. from the disclosures in some re-
cent bankruptcy proceedings concerning an
ex-employee. This individual was “manager”
of the Scone Bank, with a salary of £5O a
year. The branch office was open only for
an hour on Wednesdays and Saturdays, the
“manager” being a lawyer’s clerk at other
times on £9O a year. Except for an annual
visit of the auditor, the bank that isn’t under
State control gave its country manager a
free hand, which he exercised for seven
years to the tune of £6OOO odd. In its
efforts to evade State management the
Savings Bank of New South Wales will un-
doubtedly have the support of every de-
faulter on its list.
The comprehensiveness of some people!
According to the Age :
An extraordinary case occurred at the Hobart
(Tas.) police court recently. During the hearing
of a maintenance case, counsel for complainant said
the husband had made most sensational statements,
accusing his wife of misconduct not only with
counsel engaged on both sides, but also with the
Police Magistrate himself. In this dilemma the hear-
ing of the dispute was adjourned, pending another
Bench being constituted.
Nowadays, ’tis said, when a Tasmanian
J.P. is observed to bound enragedly from the
bench, there is no anxiety. The janitors and
others know he has not been stung—only
accused of human frailty by a litigant.
* * * *
So far, the chief result of the Melbourne
“missing woman” case —it was a “murder
case” until the law told the papers that 'the
fine would be £2O0 —has . been to provide
certain plump policemen with a little needed
physical exercise. After the arrest of Dr.
Peacock four of the law’s limbs went to his
farm at Carrum and investigated. First
they panned off the ashes of a fire, and were
rewarded by finding a few buttons and other
trifles. Then they came across a place
where a largish lump of soil had been lately
disturbed. The caretaker assured them he
had buried a dead horse there; but it was
necessary to be certain, so they bogged in.
The day was warm, and the beast had been
buried deep; also, he was very dead. The
worst of it was that after they had exhumed
the beast they had to cover him up again—
and the nearest pub was at Mordialloc, four
miles off.

“Trotter”: Sydney’s housing problem is
paralleled in Old Rome. The worker of the
Eternal City is prejudiced by the local wor-
ship of Ruins. In Italy there
is a kind of expert called the
Regulatore, or Regulator. He
is a City Planner, like that
Burnham, of the U.S., who
has done so well in San Fran-
cisco, Chicago and Manila.
The Regulatore has done good
work in Naples, Milan and
Turin, but Rome thwarts him.
He is confronted at every
turn by superb sites for
modern dwellings, monopolised
b l 7 superb churches for modern
tourists. He can only house
the local worker by commit-
ting vandalism right and left;
and anyhow the public won’t
let him vandalise, since the
churches attract the Inglese
and other foreigners, and the
foreigners mean trade. Mean-
while, the Dago poor, being
unable to go out on the mias-
matic Campagna, herd to-
gether like rats, and the dirt
and insanitariness of them and
their surroundings is enough
to make the dome of St.
Peter’s sob.
The In Memoriam pome is a poor old sub-
ject for a grin, but the following from a
Melbourne daily invites amazement:
There is a grave in the Coburg Cemetery,
A grave of covered clay,
And underneath that mossy bank
My darling father lays.
A suitable damp covering to clay can become
mossy. But what is father laying all this
time? The verse seems to suggest that father
took lessons from Mossy Isaacs, and is lay-
ing a bit under the odds.
LINES TO A MONSTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The following resolution has been passed by the
■Ohatswood branch of the Women’s Liberal League:
“That this League lias viewed with intense indigna-
nation and disgust the betrayal of his party and the
unjust treatment of their leader by Mr. Willis in his
capacity as Speaker ; and consider that thereby Mr.
Willis has forfeited the confidence and respect of all
true Liberals, and we sincerely trust that he will
never again enter the Parliament of New South
Wales as a member. —Sydney Telegraph.

May you, henceforth, be written down!

ALITIES
“Gip”: Ever feel that you want to hug
the blue haze on the hills, the song of the birds,
the scent of the wattles and the air—the air most
of all? No! . Well, spend a winter on Monaro
(N.S.W.) and watch Spring come graciously towards
you. Only the other day, snow; now, masses of
trailing clematis; white, pink, mauve Michael-
mas daisies, and the Golden Glory, swaying and
nodding on every hillside. Not yet, but soon, your
every step will crush a blossom. Purple violets and
mauve and white daisies, tall blue-bells and pink
convolvulus, buttercups, white cowslips and brazen
dandelions are everywhere. But it’s the blue hills,
with the massed snow behind them, that get right
into your heart, and make you love the place—they,
and the glorious air, so pure and crisp and sweet.
In Spring-time the birds are gladder here than they
are anywhere else in all the world. Just listen to the
goldfinches and the wee blue wrens, the bronze and
green honey-suckers and the sweet grey thrushes.
On my leafy bed I blush for two shameless lovers in
the scrub close by. “Sweet Winnie, sweet Winnie, I
want you,” he calls anxiously, and she, pleased,
pauses in her effort to carry away* a whole blade of
dry grass, and lisps back, “I . . .’ll come and kiss
you, and kiss you.” “Get work! Get work!” ad-
vises a soldier-bird, disgustedly, and a jackass roars
laughing at the whole lot of them. Oh, who’d live
in a town!
“Gip”: Somebody asked in this column,
not so long ago, why dogs rolled in unpleasantness.
I ca-n tell him why one dog did. Ballyhooley and
Paddy were both Irish terriers, though in point of
breeding Ballyhooley was much the finer gentleman.
Moreover, he had a smart stump of a tail and an
accomplishment. When requested to he smiled fran-
tically, showing every tooth in his head, in the best
post-card manner. Paddy, on the other hand, was
extremely surly, and the only person he had any re-
gard for at all was the hunter of rabbits. Also, his
tail was long. Paddy’s one aim in life was to make
Bally look small. He treated him with the utmost
contempt, and though Bally could have licked his
head off if he’d liked, he stood it all with meekness.
When robbed of his share of supper, or kicked from
his warm bed into the night, he took it philosophi-
cally, but out in the paddocks, when the hunter was
abroad, his heart would nearly break. No matter
how cleverly he caught a rabbit, Paddy always took
it from him, and, with tail wagging triumphantly,
would carry it off to the hunter. It was Paddy who
was told he was a clever dog, Paddy who got the
pat on the head, and was ordered pleasantly to go
get more. Bally stood in the background wriggling
his body and grinning idiotically. Once, to the
escaped rabbit’s great joy, he turned, and, but for
the hunter’s intervention, would have torn Paddy in
pieces. For this he got the father of a hiding. One
morning Paddy was missing, and for six weeks no-
thing was heard of him. Bally grew young again;
he caught more rabbits than he’d ever caught in his
life before, and he brought them in triumph to the
hunter as Paddy had done, and the pat on the head
and the “clever dog” came his way now. Then one
Sunday, as they walked out together, they stumbled
over poisoned Paddy. He was quite recognisable, and
lying as though asleep. The grieved hunter hardly
dared gaze on his dead favorite, but Bally, after one
long, satisfying look, turned and grinned broadly.
“Hooroo!” he shouted. “It’s himself all right,” and
capered delirously. Then, flinging himself on Paddy’s
body he deliberately rolled. Bally’s triumph was
complete.

“Left Hand”: Robert Salmon, of Bool-
coomafta station (S.A.), who advocates the breeding
of kangaroos for dingo meat, and says he practises
the dodge .on his place, and thereby succeeds in keep-
ing dogs off his sheep, is a person of large discourse,
looking before and after. But the cloven hoof of
Discrepancy sticks out beneath the coat-tail of his
argument. A dingo will never tackle an animal that
turns on him, and the ’too does this with rage in his
countenance every time. There are stacks of
seasoned old wethers and ewes that will face a dog,
and they owe their sere and yellow existence to the
fact. The wild dog prefers lamb because it runs
from him, and when lamb is “off” he makes a meal
of young sheep, because it nearly always does the
same as live lamb.
“L.L.” : If it comes to an endurance test
in the matter of burning propensities, the haystack
and the manure-heap, nominated by “The Hack” and
“Pick,” are as rapid as New York society in com-
parison with a smouldering swamp. During a severe
earth tremble in the S.E. of South Aus. and Western
Victoria about a decade ago, many of the swamps
in the desolate border locality had their innards so
disturbed that they retired from the water-holding
business. The next bush fire that happened along
burned the bottoms out of them. This, consisting
of damp decayed vegetation, that had accumulated
since the great wet day of Noah subsided from the
hilltops, smouldered for months, and in one case for
three years; but I wouldn’t be exact to a day, as
the old thing may be alight yet. Am also rather
hazy as to the precise locality—Vic. or S.A. —as the
imaginary boundary-line in those parts used to be
about as shifty as a frightened horse. [The Bulle-
tin begs to mention here two long-distance fires
which seem in danger of being overlooked. One is
a mine at Broken Hill, which has been burning for
many years. The other is the coal deposit at
Wingen (N.S.W.), which has apparently smouldered
since Deuteronomy.]

“Jimmy Crow”: The blue-tongue lizard
that bit “Wandewoi”'(B. 3/8/’ll) is not venomous.
The only weapon of defence of, the blue-tongue
(“bogi,” “bob-tailed gohanna,” or “sleepy lizard”)
is a jaw that closes like a rat-trap, and hangs on like
a cast-iron bull pup. This was probably the cause
of “Wandewoi” losing her thumb nail. “Bogi” is
useful in killing, snakes,- and there is no risk in it
for him, because the wriggler’s fangs will not pene-
trate the scaly armor of the plaintiff. He grabs for
just behind the snake’s head, and once he gets a
grip the defendant can take his choice of making his
will or ordering his. coffin. He won’t have time to
do both.
PREHISTORIC HUNTERS.—“THERE'S
NO PLACE LIKE HOMER
“Condamine”: If the ants that trouble
“K.V.8.” (B. 7/9/’ll) are “meats,” let him (1)
boil a piece of raw meat in a solution of equal quan-
tity of arsenic and washing-soda, and hang it near
the nest; (2) pour a quantity of carbon, as used in
rabbit exterminating, over the nest and apply a
match. The intruders will pass out, as though the
Lord’s hand had smitten them.
LITTLE HOPE.
LADY : "Tell me, poor man, is your blindness permanent?"
POOR MAN : “It looks like it, mum. Times is that bad, I don't see no chance of retiring."
“Mr. Ocky”: I sympathise with “Metro-
politan Cat Proprietor” in his trouble with the cat
that won’t catch rats. When Tabby first entered
my domicile he was a good, honest, solvent cat, but
now he is absolutely unmanageable, and has intro-
duced and established here half a dozen of his most
intimate friends. Besides doing all the objectionable
things mentioned by “M.C.P.,” they scramble through
the open window of my bedroom every four minutes
throughout the night (except Sunday, when they have
a prayer meeting on the roof), and in the morning
it takes the housekeeper about an hour to replace the
property I have thrown at them. They won’t leave.
Laid some strychnine for the wretches, and, as a con-
sequence, my prize dog is now under the soil, whilst
the cats are still increasing and multiplying after
their kind. As-soon as the good dog died a mongrel
rose from nowhere, and now he won’t go either. He
has regular exercise after the cats, which as often as
not seek safety on the mantel-shelf; and the blighted
mongrel bites my leg when I seek to forcibly put
him outi The cockatoo has eaten the door of the
wardrobe and the leg of the round table; the talking
parrot will not talk beyond swearing when the minis-
ter arrives ; the pony must have oats’with his chaff,
and drink with his mouth a-t the tap instead of from
the bucket, and the goat— —-. Excuse me. There’s
Strawberry bumping at the front door for another
Jonathan apple.
“Gip”: There must be a different fashion
in foxes along “Condomine’s.” way than in the
Monaro (N.S.W.), when he can talk (B. 7/9/’ll)
about the most effective method of poisoifing them.
Up here, at the beginning of the season, when you
lay baits, you’re almost certain to get a catch; but
try that ground again the following week, and not a
bait will be taken. No one can poison a ; fox here
now. Men have drawn a three mile trail, and laid
vainly every conceivable bait —caul fat, lambs’ -
tongues, sheep’s hearts, livers, tripe, bullock’s kidney,
congealed blood and other wild fowl —without suc-
cess. Not so long ago I laid a suet bait near a dead
sheep. That night I got a fox. Dropped another
tempting bait on the same spot, and two evenings
later saw a fox amble up to the.sheep, sniff about,
and pass on. I followed as far as the sheep, and
found that the bait had been turned over and left
for the unwise. Poisoners would grow rich on
Monaro if there were any' way of getting' foxes in
numbers.

“Rypo” : Was asked to “a party” at the
MacNab’s the other week. It was stipulated that
we should bring our own refreshments. Towards the
close of the evening our hostess took up a collection
to defray the hire of the piano. McNab simultane-
ously commandeered a small sum per head for , wear
and tear to the carpet and furniture. After the
party it transpired that enough eatab'-s, etc., were
left to last the family a week. It also leaked out
that the piano was there on a time-payment basis,
and that the receipts of the evening were sufficient
to pay the first three instalments on' it. Am still
debating as to whether the above is an instance of
economy, hospitality, financial genius or highway
robbery.
“Pick” : Now and then our esteemed fel-
low-citizen, the rabbit, without any apparent reason
win entirely forsake a locality long infested by him.
Between Lake Tobowrie and Durras Mountain, on the
South Coast, near Ulladulla (N.S.W.), a few years
ago, the four-legged anathema swarmed on the low-
lands, and completely honeycombed the sandhills
and flats with his warrens. The few settlers allowed
the enemy undisputed possession. But, about 18
months ago, when the season was unusually good
and the grass plentiful, the rabbits, to a bunny,
suddenly packed their Saratoga trunks, took second-
class single tickets, and left for parts unknown. I
have observed a like exodus from the Bodalla estate
and from a portion of Bungarby, on the McLaughlin
River, and I think it very probable that a similar
trek from North Gippsland has led to the recent row
among: Abo. writers.
THE ART
SECTION OF
OUR AGRICULTURAL SHOW.
MOTHER : “Oh, Mr. Slowboy, have you had a
look at Hilda!s calves?"
“9-3-11”: So far, nobody has nominated
red-heart, a timber which frequents the coastal scrubs
of Queensland, for the hardest wood championship
of Australia —which shows how little some people
really know. The first time I tried to carve red-
heart, I thought I had run against a steel tree, care-
fully painted to resemble the real goods, especially
when I saw the sparks fly. I reckon I’ve been up
against them all, but that wood—-if it is wood, and
not a money-lender’s soul —is the nearest approach
to steel I have ever seen, read or heard of. Any
scrub-cutter round Gvmpie way will back what I
say—unless he would rather commit perjury.
THE CASE OF HENRY WORRALL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sir, —I hasten to thank you for the breadth and
humanity manifested in the article on the case of
Mrs. Hop Gooev, which appears in to-day’s Argus.
... If, by industry, courage and sobriety, a man
like Mr. Gooey can win the respect of hundreds of
the people of Geelong, is this the way to express our
national appreciation of such qualities ?... What
can the great and crescent empires of the East
think of the kindergarten politicians of Australia?
... God pity us. Henry Worrall,, Methodist Par-
sonages, Brunswick. — Extracts from an infuriated
epistle in the Argus.
Hop Poon Gooey is a simple-minded Chow,
And Brother Henry Worrall is an earnest Metho-
dee;
And, down beside the Pivot, many pious people bow
To this Yellow Man who figures in the centre of the
row
Which is raging in the Argus with extreme
velocitee!
Hop Poon Gooey, well-concealed behind his smile,
Hides a sack or two of cunning and a barrow-load
of guile,
So he wandered off to China and acquired a
familee.
Then he started raising infants ’midst the cabbage at
Geelong,
While Australia said to Fisher: “Ain’t this gettin’
rather strong?—
Here’s an industry that’s booming, and we don’t
protect the Pong”-
Which aroused the Tory Argus in the cause of
pietee 1
Hop Poon Gooey has a lot of earnest friends —
Oh, how this persecution pains the local Pharisee!
So the honest Tory paper hollers loudly and pretends
To be filled with grief for Gooey, who (at intervals)
attends
To the growing of the carrot and the useful cab-
bagee!
Hop Poon Gooey, as I think I said before,
Though a simple-minded heathen knows a trick or
twenty-four,
And his yellow pagan cobbers rub their hands with
pagan glee;
For when parsondom gets going, then the politician
soon
Finds it suitable to practice at the same partic’lar
tune,
So perhaps the Door may open for each cabbage-
growing Poon,
As Canaan to the Hebrew did (see Deuteronomee).
Hop Poon Gooey goes to chapel at Geelong—•
He sings the hymns of Sankey, for an earnest man
is he;
And this is the modern gospel preached in private
to the Pong:
“Be a Clistian, give ’em tluppence, play each Sun-
day loud and stlong—
If you want to go to China and obtain a familee!”
Hop Poon Gooey, on behalf of brother Chows,
Tries his scheme experimental with the aid of those
who Wowse —
And every Pong is watching with extreme anxie-
tee;
For if Hop Pong Gooey grows more infants at Gee-
long—■
If the Argus hollers loudly till the brides from
China throng,
Then the honeymoon will flourish, and the parsons at
Hong Kong
"Will watch their converts vanishing—all heading
southerlee.
Bop Poon Gooey and his brideless brother Chows
Simply put their trust in Worrall and those parsons
who espouse
The doctrines and the dirges of his drab philoso-
phee.
So it seems the Case of Worrall.is the thing that
matters here—'
He’s the Tory’s faithful ally ’neath the holy man’s
veneer,
As his hastening .towards the Argus clearly indi-
cates to me (
Therefore, White'Australian stalwarts; would dp well
to cogitate
On the dangers Of the Pulpit and the’perils of the
Plate,
When the same is waved by champions of the
Yellow Agonee!
For the politician panders to the parson and the
crew,
Who grow hoarse in praise of Gooey, and the Tory’s
anguish, too,
Is a sign for men to ponder as they dodge the
Chinese pew
Which adorns the tabernacle of the maddened
Methodee!

Kidman’s Man” : The recent meeting of
the Bovril Company, in London, had Australian inter-
est. The company possesses a huge cattle station,
Victoria Downs, one of the farthest removed from
civilisation. It is from 1500 to 2000 miles distant
of Sydney, Brisbane or Adelaide. One hundred
thousand cattle are reported to be upon it. Anyone
who has travelled knows it is blankly impossible to
number the cattle on such a place. There is what
is called the book estimate, but it is difficult to make
London shareholders understand why every horn and
hoof is not ticketed off. Some have been complain-
ing that the estimate is exaggerated. Kidman holds
15,250 shares in this company. Rason, the chair-
man, read a letter from him, as the best
Australian authority, declaring his belief that
the cattle numbered 100,000. There are about
8000 on the routes for the cities. About 13,000 will
altogether be disposed of during the year. Kidman,
while holding that prospects are bright, hints the
risks of such fearful travel. He says the beef ought
to go in tins.

“Kodak” : Hobway was a mild man sober
and a wild man tight. When he was tight, he
smashed things, like a full-powered cyclone; when
he was sober, he repaired with exquisite skill the
damage he had done, and made what new furniture
was necessary. In 15 years he had practically re-
built and newly-furnished his home eight times.
Mrs. Hobway used to retreat placidly with the
children to her brother’s place, 10 miles away, when
a bad fit got him, confident that he would make
good the wreck by the end of the bout, and probably
add some new fittings as a bonus. One night she
arrived with the family, and quietly remarking that
“Joe was at it again,” took off her hat and started
to help get tea. That night Hobway', left alone,
saddled his horse and galloped into town to finish
his spree there. During his absence a terrific wind-
storm tore down the mountains, blew down the trees,
burst the home and strewed it all over the selection.
Three days later, Mrs. Hobway, accompanied by the
family, drove up in the dray to the fence, and won-
deringly viewed the dispersed ruins. A look of
pained surprise crept into the gentle woman’s eyes,
and she turned to her eldest girl. “Alice, child,”
she remarked sadly, “I’m afraid your poor father’s
getting worse. He never went to this length before.”
A BRAVE BOAST.
THE BOSS (cheerily): “I
guess this chap’s going to
git you off, Billy!”
WILLIAM (the breaker):
Im! Why, if 'e bucks
’is blessed skin orf, I'll
still be sittin' on the
meat!”
“Pick”: Is “Mallarapoonie” (B. 10/8/T1)
quite sure that the north-west and Carpentaria
black stays to eat the remains of his dogs after the
poisoning raids described? If so, the niggers there
have a less wholesome fear of the occult than in
most other parts of Australia. I have frequently
known sheep-owners or ’possum-trappers to remove
blacks from a favorite camping-ground by poisoning
their dogs. In every such instance Binghi’s first
concern was to get as far and as quickly away as
possible from the “debbil-debbil” and the dead.
“Left Hand” : Bushmen hoard their mem-
ories of murder trials and such-like horrors, and
treasure them above everything else. I have heard
many a “case” dragged up from the tomb of an-
tiquity and argued to rags round a camp-fire. Once
1 saw two men, who had been mates for years, fall
out through taking opposite sides in the matter of
a murder trial 17 years old. Another time an old
bush pal of mine, who had married and settled
down, wouldn’t speak to his wife for five days be-
cause he swore that Deeming had red hair and side-
whiskers, and she said his hair was black. One
night a bloke and a cove rolled up at my camp, and
after tea they and Joe got discussing a big divorce
case that had happened 10 years previously. After
a lot of argument, Joe said quietly: “I was a wit-
ness in that case, boys. She was a bad lot.” “She
was that,” replied one of the men. “Did you know
her?” Joe asked. The man grinned. “I was the
‘other party,’ ” he said. Then Joe fell on the ‘other
party’s’ neck as if it was the throat of a long-lost
brother, and the two went over the old ground again
and again until morning arrived. They were still
at it when I went to work.
“9-3-11”: How’s this for child-slavery?
Know a seven-year-old boy on the Tweed River
(N.S.W.), who is compelled to milk nine cows
every morning of his life. After milking, feeding
sundry calves and doing divers other things, he has
his breakfast, and then proceeds two miles to school.
Most of the distance he has to run, in order to
avoid trouble for being late. Returning from school
at full sj>eed, he has to round up the cows again.
Indeed, the only time he can steal from his cold-
blooded exploiters is the lunch-hour at school. This
is not an isolated case ; there are hundreds of others
in the Tweed and Richmond districts. In Murwil-
lumbah there is a man—-anyhow, he has the same
shape as a man —who proudly boasts that he takes
all that is possible out of his sons. I’m glad that
the Royal Commission, which is to inquire into this
brutal sweating of Australian children, was ap-
pointed by the Labor Government. At least, some-
body told me it had been appointed, although I
must confess that I haven’t seen it wandering round
anywhere. Perhaps it fell down dead after the first
day’s evidence.
“Gip”: Talking about the effects of
poisoned tucker, a Tubbutt man’s dog (Tubbutt is
a back-o’-the-north-wind sort of place on the Vic-
torian side where dingoes still abound) —as I was
saying, the dog threw in its soul after tackling a
strychnine bait. Next morning the owner went to
give an old pal decent burial, but he found the
dog’s bones, and lying beside them an extra size in
dingoes. But strychnine won’t kill a well-con-
ditioned pig. If you want to make waste pork of
him pass him the phosphorus. Crows fatten on
strychnine; hawks and magpies die with the first
beakful. Again, a phosphorus-poisoned rabbit ap-
parently has no ill-effects upon a dog, while a
strychnine-poisoned bunny will sometimes kill him
in the air while taking his first jump.
MODERATION.
SHEPHERD : “ Ah! Tight again, fimrny. You drink far too much, you know.”
J IMMY: "No feah. Mine c'u'd dr inkit plurry barrel.”
SHEPHERD : “ Tut, tut, you must moderate your language.”
J IMMY: “ Orright, boss. Mine c’u’d on’y drinkit half ’em plurry barrel”
“Yalgun”: Would advise the coachy (B.
31/8/’ll) to move into a pub at once, as a horse’s
leg will set. There is a horse on the road between
Bonalbo and Casino, working in a carrier’s team,
that has completely recovered from a broken thigh.
Also, I know a Narrabri stockman, whose horse
broke its front leg near the fetlock. Having no suit-
able weapon wherewith to slay his property, he
pulled the saddle off, and left it. Two years after
he encountered the derelict with a well-set, if crooked,
leg.
“Gum-Sucker”: Re “Pick's” yarn (B.
31/8/’ll) of the sheepfold which burned for 18
months. I was up Gippsland (Vic.) way in 1908,
when an old sawdust heap caught fire. Called on the
conflagration six months ago, and found it still
burning. There is little to choose between old saw-
dust and Hell for the Aged Smoulder Stakes.
* * * *
The argument as to whether poisonous
snakes climb trees and other upended vegetables, is
hereby finally and honorably settled. Each side
agrees unanimously that the other knows nothing
about the matter, and rather than appear dis-
courteous, The Bulletin agrees with both parties.
If any contributor wishes to appeal against this de-
cision, let him appear in person on Tuesday, which
is the day the Religious Editor sharpens the teeth
of the office bloodhound.
“Expert” supplies some shed statistics:
Jim Powers (killed in S. Africa) shore 315 at Bareena
or Rockwood many years ago, and Jack Howe (now
a pub-keeper) 321 at Alice Downs, making an Aus-
tralian record. These are the two best old-time
tallies. Teddy Fern shore 233 big merino wethers
at Manuka (Queensland). He is still going strong
at Blackall. The day Fern shore 233, Ruhini, the
Maori, shore 333 in Maoriland. His subjects were
border Leicester wethers, as big as bullocks, but
crutched right over the tails, and with no wool at
all on the heads or points. Dan Cooper, at Winton,
in 1910, shore 316, and Ted Dean 283 at Alice
Downs in 1908. The latter, with a stop-watch on
him, shore 12 lambs in 10 minutes. Harry Living-
stone, in ’O4 or ’O5, cut 253 at Maxwellton. He is
now travelling in the interests of a shearing-machine
co. up Charleville way. The big left-hander Seary,
at Charlotte Plains, three years ago, unclothed 274;
while Zimmerle, the same day, performed the same
office, alongside Seary, for 244. That Seary has lost
none of his speed is shown by his Blackall scour
tally of 260 ewes on August 29 this year. Lately
chatted with Livingstone, Dean and Les Seary. The two
former will not shear either in shed or matches unless
they are allowed to use one brand of machine, but
long Les Seary is open to use any make. I hap-
pened to have a few machines other than what were
being used on the board, so handed him one, and he
shore all day with it, not losing a stroke. How does
the late championship match compare with these
tallies, which were done as an every-day occurrence
in the heat and sweat of Central Queensland, with
all the rest of the week to be worked?
“Pete”: Said to be the only one of its
kind in Maoriland is a yellow-flowering rata tree,
which grows beside the Mokau River (North Island),
about seven miles up, amongst beautiful but little-
known scenery. The red rata, both the tree and vine
varieties, is very common all over the Dominion, but,
so far, two specimens only of yellow rata have been
known. Both were on the Mokau River bank, and
one has now disappeared. The botanical name is
Metrosiderous florida aurata, and the flowers are
highly prized by botanists. March and April are the
months of bloom.
ON THE SOUTH COWST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In connection with the compulsory training of
cadets, the dairy farmers on the South Coast are
being considerably inconvenienced on account of boys
being compelled to drill in the afternoons. These
drills take place at the time when milking opera-
tions are in full swing, and as most of the farmers’
boys are engaged in this work, they find it hard to
spare them. — Sydney Telegraph.
It was the peaceful eventide;
Brown’s milkers swished " their tails,
While Brown’s three youngsters sat beside
And filled the gleaming pails.
The thin, white spurts of precious juice
Struck smart and hard like shot;
Brown filled the cowyard with abuse
And mopped his forehead hot.
“Git over there!” He thrust his head
Against the milker’s flank,
And swore again.. “Gor’ strike me dead !
You are a blanky blank!”
To left and right the steady hail
Of cow-juice did not cease ;
The snow-white foam rose in each pail;
Save Brown, all were at peace.
“Gor’ strike me dead, what with yer drills—
(I’ll d —n well murder you!)
An’ Wages Boards and other frills
I dunno what to do 1
“Why can’t they leave us be, I say?”
The toiling youngsters bent
Towards their cows and milked away
Upon their work intent.
“Git over there!” The angry sun
Glared through the cowyard haze.
‘‘Teachin’ you kids to use a gun!
An army !... Spare me days !
“You kids don’t want to learn no drill!
You stay at ’ome with me ;
There ain’t no enemy ter kill,
As fur as I can see.
“And if there is —well, work comes first!
We gotter pay our way.
If cows ain’t milked this game’ll burst,
That’s all I gotter say!”
Each youngster, silent as his brute,
Worked on without a word ;
They had no time to talk or shoot
With that impatient herd.
They had no time to watch the sea
That washed the cliffs grass-crowned;
They milked and listened wretchedly,
Their eyes upon the ground.
The raiding cruiser shoreward sped,
And hung upon a swell;
A gun put out its tongue bright red,
And spat a 12-inch shell.
The cowyard burst —the cows burst too;
The milk was mixed with blood ;
The boss alone was left to chew
The bitter shimose cud.

“Bails,” writing in short barks, gives a
send-off to a lately-deceased barrister
Goldsmith, or Goldy, is mourned in Melbourne.
Q.C., but his fame is as the most dashing bat of the
East Melbourne Cricket Club in its early days.
This club, with its famous blue and white stripes,
arose from the veriest trickle. A boys’ club, founded
by A. E. Clarke, Moody, the Murphys and a few
other Scotch College fellows, under the name of the
Abbotsford, playing near Dight’s mills, by the Yarra,
Collingwood. They moved to Richmond paddock,
outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and got the
East Melbourne ground bv some mysterious fluke.
It had been refused by Government to the influential
Civil Service Club. The East Melbourne club sprang
up as distinctly colty, with such as Goldsmith,
Wilkie, Goggin, Hastings, Riggall, Eggleston, Allee
(not Allan), Horan, Boyle, O’Mullane and E.
Elliott, against the sober-siders of the Melbourne
club, comparative veterans like Cosstick, Gid Elliott,
Greaves, Coulstock, Hammersley, Wray, Wills, Gib-
son, Wardill and Marshall. ' See A. E. Clarke’s
“History of the East Melbourne Club.” The success
of this club made the M.C.C. far more generous to
colts, the new concern having arisen through its
Toryism. Among M.C.C. noted colts were Jacomb,
J. T. T. Smith, and Tait.
THE WHIRLING ONE.
HE (proudly) : "I’ve been round
the world nine times. ”
S HE: “Didn't it

The kirk in Sydney has been sore put upon
by the action of the Stanmore fold in “call-
ing” a youthful immigrant to be its spiritual
leader. Stanmore is one of the best-paid of
the Haggisterian kirks of N.S.W., and sev-
eral dour parsons, who have been chasing
souls in general, and bawbees in particular,
in the back-blocks, feel that the will of Provi-
dence is unco’ deeficult to put up wi’ at times.
The vagrant gospel-miller, who has not
hitherto been in charge of a church any-
where, happened to deliver one sermon in
the Stanmore chapel which hit the deacons,
elders and entire congregation fair in the
conscience, and, despite opposition from the
fathers of the Assembly, they ran him up to
the rostrum, and nailed him to the Good
Wor-r-r-k.
Attorney-General Hughes has been or-
dered to take three months’ rest. Fortu-
nately, he wasn’t ordered to take the waters
at Yassberra. The new Governor-General
hasn’t had a look at these waters yet.
There are three women among the 35 can-
didates who want to run in the Labor in-
terest at the next Senate election in N. S.
Wales —Mrs. Dwyer, President of the
Women’s Organising Committee; Mrs.
McNamara, of the King P.L.L.; and Mrs.
Maincke, of the Darlinghurst League.
R. G. F. Weber, father of Melbourne’s
beautiful wrestler, died at Brighton a few
days ago. He came to Australia in the ’so’s,
and settled in Brighton when it was a forest.
In his younger days ho was a powerful
“local preacher,” and developed his muscle
by expounding the AVord.
Fame! Some enquiring mind has written
to T.P.’s Weekly for information as to the
verse beginning, “Life is mostly froth and
bubble.” Two people sent in the complete
verse, one ascribing it to Gordon, the other
to Ella Wheeler Wilcox! T.P. (28/7/T1)
just prints both names, without trying to de-
cide between them.
Peter Allen, the licensed jester of the S.
Aus. Assembly, had a useful and unusual
present from his constituents, the other day
a 2J-h.p. motor-cycle, to replace his old
push bike. His district (AVallaroo) con-
tains a lot of sand and scrub, with hardly
any railways, and he claims to have pedalled
up and down it for 8000 miles during one
three-years Parliament.
Lachlan McTaggart has lived on Wooltana
station, two-thirds of the way from Adelaide
to Iniiamincka, where Burke and Wills died,
for 54 years. The sheep he depastures
there are descendants of the flock which his
father drove up from Mount Gambier (tak-
ing three months on the road) in 1857. He
is the only man in the district —which is far
in the interior—who has held his land ever
since it was taken from the blacks.
The N.S.W. political pot will bubble
afresh at AVest Maitland, where there will
have to be an election to fill John Gillies’s
old shoes. Gillies, who had been in the
House since 1891, died rather suddenly.
David Brutus Storey reckoned him in with
his Independents ; but, as a matter of fact,
he was just as liable to punch Brutus as to
biff Caesar. He had voted both for and
against every Ministry that held office
during the past 20 years. He had been con-
nected with the pretty powerful Maitland
Mercury most of his life —latterly as part-
owner and manager—and the tolerably
bright member who can get the tolerably
bright local paper to mention his services
three times a week has a strong pull over
the rest of the earth.
The late James Rutherford was the
nearest thing to a Rockefeller or Fairy
Grandfather that Bathurst (N.S.W.) ever
knew. The old nobility
of Bathurst have the vir-
tue of economy deve-
veloped to an abnormal
degree. Speaking gener-
ally, the more affluent
the Bathurst aristocrat
is the dustier and more
insanitary-looking is his
attire, and the less dis-
posed he is to squander
his savings on anyone
but himself. It had been
the convention for years,
whenever any of Bath-
urst’s public institutions
or movements, or what
not, showed signs of
wilting, for the officials
or promoters to gallop
distractedly to Ruth-
erford; and they
mostly left the pre-
sence with a cheque.
It was one of the few
directions in which
the Bathurst Anti-
Socialists showed a
measure of consist-
ency ; they rarely
sought State aid, un-
til they had failed in
an assault on Ruther-
ford.
Since the present
S.A. session began
Acting-Speaker Jack-
son (Labor) has at-
tended to the duties
of Speaker Coles, who
is ill, in addition to
filling his own job as
Chairman of Commit-
tees, and has done all
this work without a
break, and without
any relief. Although
he is the youngest
member in the House,
he is looking an in-
tensely fagged poli-
tician, and he will be the gladdest man in
the House when his double-barrelled engage-
ment ends. Jackson is desperately conscien-
tious, and doesn’t allow a single mption
(even one of adjournment) to be put with-
out being formally “seconded,” a departure
from the established practice for over a quar-
ter of a century.
Of the original 32 members of the Mel-
bourne Stock Exchange, established in 1861,
but one now remains—J. S. Butters. The
early-day members usually met for business
“under the verandah.”
Things are improving; the appointment of
Canon Long to wear the gaiters at Bathurst
(N.S.W.) makes the fourth Bishop to come
out of Trinity College, Melbourne. Green,
Armstrong and Stretch were this new high
priest’s predecessors.
About a cat who watched a king:—
Detective A. Murdock, who has just retired from
the N.S.W. force, came to Sydney in 1884, and had
scarcely been measured for his' buttons before he
got an introduction to “de push.” He was on duty
in Sussex-street when the historic engagement hap-
pened between the Gipps-street and Bathurst-street
blokes. There were some mighty bad marksmen
among the combatants, or else Murdock’s luck was
in, for five ineffective shots were fired at him while
lie was commandeering one of the opposing chief-
tains. The bullets lodged in the door of the old
Derbyshire Arms Hotel. Also, he partook of some
hot stuff at the famous Bondi free fight. In fact,
the stuff he partook of was generally hot. It was
scorching one night when a gas explosion at his
home fired a friend through the window, and Mur-
dock, burnt and shaken, staggered upstairs and
looked to his small children. Then he staggered
down again and cabbed to the hospital to inquire
about his blown-out friend ; but it was an uncon-
scious Murdock the attendants carried out of the
cab, and it was a very sick and scarified Murdock
the doctors and nurses watched in the weeks follow-
ing. He helped Roche and Rochaix to shoo the
anarchists away from the present King and Queen
during their Australian tour, and perhaps that' was
the coolest job Murdock ever tackled.
IF THEY DON'T HURRY.
It was stated in the Federal Parliament last week
that some of the youths who were measured for their
uniforms many months ago, had not yet received
them. — Item.
Message Boy (year 1960): “Here y’ are
Mistah, your uniform. The tailor’s only
Just finished it .”
OLD MAN (Australian born): “Ah, yes, I can
mind when I was measured for it. I believe
it was just a year or two before the Japs
came.”
Passed in at Tunbridge Wells (Eng.) re-
cently, William James Tyrone Power (eldest
son of Tyrone Power, one of the great
comedians of his day), soldier, magistrate,
diplomatist and author. He served in
China, Maoriland (1846-47), through the
Kaffir war (1851 to ’53) and Canada. At
the end of the Kaffir war, in 1853, he was
appointed a commissioner for the settlement
of frontier claims, and thereafter held im-
portant offices until 1876, when he was
made Agent-General at London for Maori-
land. He was 92 when the hour-glass ran
out.
Percy Sholto Douglas, ninth Marquis of
Queensberry, has sailed from Liverpool for
the United States with the intention of be-
coming an American citizen. “There’s no
room for me here,” he said to the reporters.
‘We are played out. The day of the lord in
England is over, and I am going where the
man and not the title counts.” He is dis-
gusted with a lot or things, one of them
being that “the other day the Liberals made
a wealthy Jew, who is in a sanatorium, a
peer of England.” The Marquis adds that
the blessed nobility to which he belongs is
entirely destitute of constructive states-
manship.”

“Red Tape, junr.”: G. E. Brodie, or G.
E. Beresford Brodie, sometime Director of
Government Asylums, Chief Audit Inspector
and filler of other billets, is still the problem
of the N. S. Wales public service. Last
year the P.S. Board made him acting-
accountant in the Lands Department, a
job said to be worth only £550, though
Brodie’s old salary of £750 was not, and
apparently could not be, reduced. Since
then the permanent accountant has retired,
and G.E.8.8. is again gazetted as the stop-
gap. A couple of our chaps, who had their
eyes glued on the billet, have thus been
blocked on their way to promotion, and
when I take them up in the elevator each
morning I don’t need to switch on the cur-
rent. Their language would make a balloon
soar.

(all born in the State) who have 49 chil-
dren among them, while O’Loughlin and his
brother-in-law have 20 sons and daughters,
lhat is 69 children among six fathers.

By “Cricketer” :
Tk e .l a te Louis Goldsmith was one of the best
Victorian batsmen of the ’7o’s, and a champion
long field. It was one of the regrets of his life, that
m playing against W. G. Grace’s team in 1873, he
missed W.G. in the long field. In ’7O he played
against Sydney University, one of the Uni. team
being Edmund Barton. This was the start of a
friendship which ended only with Goldsmith’s death.
Old-timers tell of the occasion when, in a game be-
tween East Melbourne and Melbourne, in ’7l, Ford,
of Melbourne, hit a ball out of the ground. Boun-
daries being then unknown. Goldsmith scaled the
fence, fell, and was knocked senseless. As he was
out of sight of the players, no one knew what had
happened until eight runs had been scored, and then
they went to look for Goldsmith. A compromise was
arrived at, giving Ford six runs for a lost ball.
Tommy Horan, and others of that period, still argue
on the legality of this decision.
“Religious Editor” : The fact that £71,000
worth of Bourke-street, Melbourne, was
sold, the other day, at the rate of £1075 per
loot, makes me wonder whether Paradise is
only another Melbourne or Sydney with the
did congestion disease in a severer form.
Ihe Bible’s references to golden streets may
be merely the picturesque Hebraic method of
saying that property values there are in-
sanely high, owing to the immense accumu-
lation of souls from this and the countless
other worlds which revolve without any ap-
parent reason in the vast and lofty engine-
room of Space. I can’t imagine any Cohen
walking regularly throughout Eternity to his
celestial pawnshop over an 18-carat pave-
ment. My theory is that the land there is
quoted at about £987,000,000 per foot, and
that when the chilled and penniless soul of
the land monopolist from another sphere
blows up to the Gates, and reads the gold-
leaf signboards of the Better Land and
Estate Agents, it crumbles utterly and drifts
slowly downward past the incandescent stars
as an insignificant pinch of dust.

South Australia’s oldest Rag Merchant.
Norseman,” from Lautoka, Fiji, pictures
the pleasant things that happen when the
nigger is introduced “to aid in the develop-
ment of the country” :
Compared with Victoria, Fiji is a doll’s house
alongside a Tyson property; yet the last sitting of
the Supreme Court here was polluted with nine
coolies’ offences, embracing rape, murder, bodily
harm, forging and uttering, and bribery. At Taviuni
you can see two big cuts in the mosquito net on a
man’s bed. The cuts landed where a head was sup-
posed to lie. Luckily the head had shifted itself.
In this country heads get into the habit of doing
that. They have to. At Rewa, an Indian has been
enticing black damsels away from their homes. The
black ghoul practically Jack-the-Rippered them.
With many salaams he eventually admitted that he
ran a human rape and slaughter-house. And there
is another side to this awful black slavery. I have
seen black women being carried off the sugar fields,
in the noon-day heat, to give birth to their infants.
The treatment of the women is scandalous. A week-
ago an Indian slashed the fingers off his female
“freehold’s” hands, because she put her mark to a
secret agreement to become another black gentle-
man’s “leasehold.” Another Indian here has leased
his wife for £B. When you ask what the country
is getting out of this pollution, the only answer is
that it is helping to provide big dividends to a few
people who never see it, and small jobs to another
few people who mostly wish that they had never
seen it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. A. A. Billson (Minister of Education) motored
to Sunbury yesterday, to lay the memorial stone of
the new State school building. A silver trowel,
suitably inscribed, was presented to the Minister. —
Melbourne Argus.
When soon our Minister is placed
Upon a high, dark shelf in haste,
Since the electors are unkind,
By frequent promises unbribed,
Some consolation he may find
In trowels, suitably inscribed.
When kids and teachers are forgot,
And prancing parents trouble not,
He will remember, to the last,
The few kind pushers who imbibed
Big bealcers to his health, and passed
Him trowels, suitably inscribed.
Will he forget ’em—those that came
And piled on him all sorts of blame,
And those that worked him all they knew,
And those that swore and those that gibed?
Will he forget ’em, for a few
Poor trowels, suitably inscribed?
VICTORIA.

This State Bank borrows on mortgage bonds at
from 3* to 4 p.c., and lends at the uniform rate of
4* p.c. The advances are for from five to 42 years.
According to the Act of 1895, they were to be made
“to farmers and other producers, to Local Authori-
ties, and in aid of other industries, at reasonable
rates, on convenient terms, and upon proper securi-
ties” ; but by an amending Act, the advantages were
extended to “all persons possessed of the necessary
security.” Farmers have, however, borrowed the
bulk of the £1,786,763 so far advanced. Repay-
ment is made by instalments. On agricultural land,
borrowers who take the maximum term of 42 years,
pay 16s. 6d. p.c. p.a., making, with interest, £5
6s. 6d. p.c. p.a.—much less than, on the average,
farmers had to pay in interest alone a few years
ago. The benefit conferred by this State bank upon
farmers is not, therefore, to be measured by the
amount of the bank’s own advances; hundreds of
Anti-Socialistic backbones that never go inside its
doors have had their interest bills reduced to the
extent of hundreds of pounds through this Socialistic
concern’s operations.
As money is available through the repayment of
loans, the bank’s trustees are obliged to repurchase
mortgage bonds, and then issue fresh bonds to raise
the money for new advances. This shows the opera-
tions for some years past:—

The advances made have totalled £1,786,763,
of which £966,944 has been repaid, leaving
£819,819 outstanding, or £34,409 in excess of
the amount borrowed on bonds. This excess repre-
sents part of the reserve fund; the balance is in
premises. The reserves are not at all formidable;
but they are mounting up steadily, and, if the pre-
sent low rate charged for advances is not made still
lower, they should henceforth increase more rapidly,
because the expenses are gradually coming down in
proportion to the total outstanding. A few years
ago, when the bank borrowed at £3 15s. p.c., and
spent 15s. p.c. in administration, there was no
margin at all, seeing that advances were made at
£4 10s. p.c. ; in fact, no profit at all would have
been shown in those days had various small fees
not been charged for services. Nowadays the exes,
have been reduced to 12s. 4d. p.c. of the mortgages,
and as the total of advances increases, the figure
should come still lower, and the fund for contin-
gencies should become more substantial. The next
table shows the expense rate: —

S. Aus. has been on the up-grade for six or seven
years now, hence, naturally, the bank hasn’t had
securities thrown on its hands. Yet, even so, that
the arrears of interest over-due six months and more,
should amount to only £lO6, is a surprising per-
formance. For it must be remembered that this
isn’t an ordinary bank. When the half-year ends, and
the interest falls due to the ordinary bank, you don’t
take alone any cash as a rule ; the bank simply adds
the interest on to the overdraft, rules a line, and
starts with a slightly bloated entry. But when in-
terest falls due to the State Bank, hard cash is
called for. As always happens when people work on
C.O.D. principles, both parties then know exactly
where they are; and though losses are still possible,
the chances of the parties drifting or being dragged
out of their depth, are enormously reduced.

The half-year’s earnings were at the rate of £9
11s. 9d. p.c. p.a. on capital and reserves combined,
and the magnitude of those figures suggests: (1)
that this bank has an extremely profitable connection,
and (2) that there are few, if any, over-valued assets
or dead accounts, which is another way of saying
that the reserves are the real thing. Certainly big
profits might spring from another source —the use of
a big proportion of public money. Thus a bank
which has the use of £lO of the public’s money for
every £1 of its own, ought to be making more profit
than one which has the use of only £5. But big profits
earned in that way mean big risks, because no matter
what may happen to the securities, the depositors,
etc., will expect to get back their money intact.
The Commercial of Tasmania, however, stands very
well in this respect, for it makes its big profit in
spite of the fact that for every £ 1 of its own
money, it has rather less than £4 10s. of the pub-
lic’s in the business.
The principal movements in the past 12 months
are shown next:—

Bigger deposits, smaller advances —that ought to
mean reduced profits, along with reduced risks. The
total amount owing to the public is £1,710,643;
and the very satisfactory proportion of 39 p.c. of that
is held in liquid forms. Altogether, the figures call
for bouquets rather than bricks, though the investor
isn’t likely to be attracted by the fact that there
are only three directors, one of whom is managing
director, and that the accounts are apparently never
submitted to the inspection of an auditor appointed
by the shareholders.

This co.’s luck has been mixed during the year. The
Yongala was lost with all hands, the Colac and the
little Kepler were wrecked on the Westralian coast,
and the Flinders was burned so badly that it was
turned into a coal hulk. One result of all this is
that a bite was taken out of the Insurance Fund. It
is an amazingly profitable concern, which, in spite of
these disasters, can still pay a 10 p.c. dividend on
stock that has been heavily watered. Yet it wasn’t
always so affluent. Only a year before Federation
arrived the £lO shares could be got for less than
par. The capital was then £202,870, and the shares
were held in a few hands. Probably the owners of
those few h.auds knew a thing or two, and had been
steadily buying; anyway, in 1900-1, it leaked out
that things were tar better than they had seemed,
and shares sprang up to £25. Inter-State shipping
increased enormously; trade in and with Westralia
flourished ; and, instead of fighting one another for
the plums, the shipping cos. fixed matters nicely
among themselves. The future depends largely upon
that honorable understanding; and whether it will
be maintained, or whether the Commonwealth law
will rip it up, this paper doesn’t know. So far,
when somebody has squeaked about abnormal freights
—from North Queensland, for instance —and called
the honorable understanding a thief, somebody else
has chipped in with the remark that the ring has
resulted in far better boats and a more regular ser-
vice ; and that is so plainly true that the first squeak
has been drowned.
How well or badly a shipping co. is doing isn’t
usually apparent from its published accounts. Few
tricks are easier than for such a co. to hide its
profits by writing down its assets —in other words,
by paying for new ships out of profits. Yet the
money that is paid for new ships isn’t all profit, be-
cause those new ships may be more or less replacing
old ships that have been turned into hulks and
lighters ; so even if you know what money has been
put into new shins, you don’t know everything that
is worth knowing. It is possible, though, to get
some results by digging. Take this, for instance: —
, 1906. 1911.
Assets, other than steamers,
freeholds, wharves, and
shares in other cos. ..£174,134 £234,319
Liabilities 39,226 74,724
Surplus . . . . £134,908 £159,595
The surplus of more or less liquid assets has thus
increased by £24,687 in five years. Meantime,
though no capital has been got in from shareholders,
the tonnage of the co.’s fleet has been increased, in
spite of recent losses, from 53,689 tons to 61,637
tons, and large payments have been made on account
of four other steamers, aggregating 25,600 tons.
Also, various hulks and lighters have been added,
and it is well-known that large investments have
been made in coal and other properties. From all
this it is quite certain that the co., besides paying
its dividend, has been making very large provision
for depreciation and contingencies. There is a cer-
tain vagueness about that, no doubt; but, anyhow,
it seems a safe conclusion that, on the past record,
the 10 p.c. div. is very sure unless some extraor-
dinary run of bad luck strikes the fleet, or the bottom
drops out of the pleasant little arrangement in which
the cos. now null together.

Sydney has four ferry cos. Two of them are in
clover all the time; the other two find a patch of
the vegetable only now and then. This is one of the
other two. It has no excursion traffic worth men-
tioning ; and nobody goes where it plies unless he
has to, and then he usually goes by tram. Some
few years ago the directors thought they might mend
things by buying picnic grounds on the Harbor
foreshores; and though some of this land has since
been sold, “Freehold properties, wharves, etc.,” still
stand at £34,739, and apparently the return from
this asset is very wretched indeed. Probably it
takes most of the net earnings from this source to
pay interest on the £15,000 or so of mortgage and
other debt on the property. The recent history of
the co., as told in the table printed above, is bad
enough; yet the truth may be even worse. All
depends on whether enough is written off to provide
for depreciation of the co.’s ferries. Something is
alleged to be written off; but the amount isn’t hinted
at. All that can be arrived at is this: Three years
ago “ship properties” stood at £45,762; they now
stand at £45,613 —practically the same. But, mean-
time, the Lady Chelmsford has been added, and four
ancient arks have been disposed of. Therefore, in
the three years, the fleet has been written down
to the extent of the difference between what was paid
for the Lady Chelmsford, and what was realised for
the four arks. There doesn’t appear to be anything
very drastic in that writing down. It probably
means that the co. is putting aside enough for de-
preciation to buy a new boat every five years or so.
Still, this is all more or less guesswork. Assuming
that the directors are writing off just enough, then in
the past three years, the co. has actually paid away
more than it has earned, in spite of the fact that in
two half-years there was no dividend at all, and in
another only 5 p.c. This doesn’t inspire much con-
fidence in the co.’s financial management. No doubt

The true reserves are less than shown in the last
line, and so probably are the true profits for the half-
year. The true reserves are less because “Purchase
account” figures as an asset worth £35,258, and all
or part of this is goodwill. The nucleus of the
business belonged to the Brisbane Electric Supply
Co., which sold out to this co. six or seven years
back, and this item dates from that time. And the
true profits are probably less than £10,284, because
£3lBO of them has been added to a renewal, replace-
ment and contingencies reserve, and some or all of
this may represent the half-year’s wear and tear;
though it has been the co.’s practice so far to pay for
current renewals out of current revenue. Neverthe-
less, a time may come when extraordinary renewals
may be called for, and then this fund may be
drawn upon. Making very liberal deductions to cover
this and other contingencies, the profit is very hand-
some, and the obese dividend on ordinary shares is
very comfortably earned.
As mentioned above, a Purchase account —presum-
ably goodwill—figures among the assets for £35,258.
Now, the co.’s right to live is based on various
Orders-in-Council, conferring titles which expire in
1940. In that year the municipalities may take
over the co.’s undertaking by paying a fair price
for the plant, etc., used in the business. Goodwill
is not to be paid for. Therefore, it becomes neces-
sary to wipe out the paper asset ( £35,258) by 1940;
and an appropriation of £lOOO a year is being made
for the purpose. Consenuently that amount also may
fairly be deducted from the profits shown above. If the
municipalities do not exercise their right in 1940,
they may do so 10 years later, or at the end of
any subsequent 10 years. Until they do so, and pay
the then value, the co. is entitled to go ahead;
and it evidently reckons that there is more ahead
than there is behind, seeing that, in the past three
years, it has put £47,508 into mains, plant, and
buildings. Of this sum £22,936 has been provided
by shareholders (the capital is now £96,227) ; the
balance is undivided profit. The co.’s financial posi-
tion is very easy: its cash and book debts exceed all
its liabilities.

Profits. Dividends. Reserves, licit.
April, 1910.. - - £31,729
Dec., 1910.. £13,549 6 p.c. = £5670 £7879 23,850
June, 1911.. 6,665 6 „ „ 5542 1123 22,727
The present co. paid £41,983 for the goodwill, but
the old co. transferred a reserve fund of £10,254,
thus reducing the goodwill item to the £31,729
with which the foregoing table makes a start.
The net value of the business, including the
goodwill, was put at £105,755, and 105,755 £1
shares were issued to the shareholders in the old co.
in full payment. The public was offered and greedily
took another 100,000 shares—-largely, no doubt, on the
strength of the prospectus statement that “the net
profits of the business during the five years ended
Dec. 31 averaged £20,774 p.a This rate has
been considerably exceeded during the current year.”
It is probably the co.’s bad luck that in its first 15
months, and notwithstanding all the new capital put
into the business, it has netted less than the old co.
used to average in 12 months. No doubt the past
year hasn’t been quite so profitable for the wool-
broker as some recent ones have been, owing to the
shrinkage in values, and, consequently, in commis-
sions ; also a good deal of the capital is being put
into new premises, etc., and isn’t yet productive.
Still, giving all that in, the results are disappoint-
ing, especially when compared with those that were
previously recorded. A stock and station and pas-
toral finance co. which, in these times of prosperity,
mops up 85 p.c. of its profits in paying a 6 p.c. divi-
dend, could certainly do with a larger helping of
luck, before times of the other sort hit it.

But in considering the profits an eye must be kept
on the increase of capital; in 1900 the total was
£lOO,OOO, and it is now £198,760. Still, on the
whole, the past four years have given reasonably satis-
factory results. Nothing, certainly, to get at all
excited about, because there has been very little to
lay by after the strictly moderate 7 p.c. has been
paid on ordinary shares. The 6* p.c. on pref. shares
looks better; but when a pref. dividend of that size
has to be offered to attract capital, it doesn’t say
much for the fiscal laws of the country. Offer 5 p.c.
for pref. capital in a bank, and even though it was
of less repute than Kaiapoi is as a manufacturer of
woollen goods, it would no doubt get the money.
Yet surely, especially in a wool-producing country,
the law ought to show that it has as much regard
for a woollen manufacturing co. as it has for a bank.
If really effective Protection were the settled policy
of the country, there would, moreover, be less need to
go to shareholders for the whole of the trading capi-
tal of a concern of this" kind; the banks would
supply a great deal more of it than they do to-day,
and on more reasonable, terms. As it is, they view
commercial paper with a sniff of suspicion, and rely
mainly on land-mortgage business, which isn’t bank-
•ug at all. Things being as they are, and banks’
support being uncertain, this co. has certainly
strengthened its position by increasing its capital.
Yet, even with its new capital, it still has to carry
a considerable liability, mainly because increased
business means a bigger stock, and more book debts.
This indicates various movements: —

One has to take a great deal on trust in a case of
this kind, because the value of the stock must be a
matter of estimate only. Moreover, it doubtless
includes much raw material which is liable to con-
siderable and sudden fluctuations. To that extent
the business is speculative, and profits are almost
certain to fluctuate —for which reason the wise man
won’t pay much regard to the figures of any single
year, or even of any two or three years.

Though Albert Borchard signs the accounts as audi-
tor, and though in most cases that is good enough
guarantee for anything, The Bulletin would like
~L S co -’ s present statement better if it were put
differently. The trouble is that the Profit and Loss
account shows “net profit on trading, after payment
of. . . .rent, salaries, dividend on pref. shares, sta-
• il er ~ v ’” etc. Why should dividend be included
with rent and stationery ? It wouldn’t matter so much
if it were possible to ascertain the amount of this
dividend, for then the total could be added on to the
profits; but that isn’t possible, because this capital
has been gradually dropping in during the year. As
a result, the directors’ report presumably mis-states
the facts: “Your directors recommend payment of a
div. at the rate of 10 p.c. p.a. on the paid-up capital
of the co., which will absorb £2745.” Apparently that
is only on the paid-up ordinary capital. The total
paid capital is now £71,831, in 20,000 pref. shares
paid to 10s. (with £6847 paid in advance), 50,000
ordinaries fully paid to £l, and 10,000 ordinaries
paid mostly to 10s. The prefs. have been issued
during the half-year; and ss. has been called on the
last issue of ordinaries. This new capital has re-
sulted in the reduction of the co.’s liabilities from
£58,425 to £44,763, including £31,950 of a plaster
on the city freehold bought a while ago from the
Cooper estate. Capital, reserves and liabilities are
represented by: Freeholds and leaseholds, stock and
plant, £58,485; book- debts, £74,684. Book debts
include the amounts owing on time-payment bar-
gains. The reserves apparently include provision
against losses on these transactions. The published
accounts themselves nut the matter this way:—

P. & L. Additions to
Account). Reserve Fund.

Given normal conditions, the losses on time-payment
bargains are surprisingly small. The shop that sells
a thing straight-out on credit is pretty certain to lose
the thing if it can’t collect payment. If the worst
comes to the worst, it stands in with other creditors
for (say) Is. o*d. in the £. On the other hand,
if the time-payment man’s customer fails, the goods
can be carried back to the shop ; if he fails early in
the proceedings, the goods are then practically new;
and the longer he pays the less likely he is to fail.
With a sharp slump in national prosperity, throwing
large numbers out of work, such a co. as this would
no doubt be up against trouble; but even then it
would be much better off than the concern which
gives credit without any security at all.

Money, which ought to be by this time almost en-
tirely unknown in Australia, and especially in N. S.
Wales, is more plentiful than ever it was; and the
political prophets wiio explained that it would for a
certainty flee to parts unknown, are raking it in
with both hands, and investing it in the country just
as though the country was not “doomed.” New
suburbs are being opened, and new roads made, and
“Father of One,” who wrote the bitter letters to the
papers about the impending ruin, orders another
load of gravel for the sidewalk, just as though things
were going to be all right. And the affluent person
who wouldn’t trust the Labor party to run a pie-
stall, let alone a country, is pressing a few millions
upon that party; and the party, unfortunately, is
taking the millions, and putting them, or some of
them, into gravel and road metal. Thus, one way
and another, this co. is having a good time ; though
the good time had a cloud thrown over it the other
day, when the Government announced that it had
got rather tired of providing quarry-owners with 10
p.c. divs., and was going to be its own quarryman
in the future. Probably that will affect this co. to
some slight extent. The turn of the tide of pros-
perity will, however, affect it more. There are some
things that man buys sparingly when times are bad,
and gravel and road metal are two of them; so we
haven’t to go back more than about six years to find
this co. “passing” a dividend altogether. Since
then it has certainly put itself on a firmer footing.
Five years ago it owed £3328 in excess of the value
of its assets other than quarries and fixed improve-
ments; now it has £8703 of those assets in excess
of liabilities. That means an improvement of
£12,031 —not all the result of trading, certainlv,
because £6BOO of new capital has been got in. Still
practically all that capital was put into quarrv
property and appliances. The five years’ record is
excellent; but, as already indicated, there is liable to
be a very serious difference between the years of
general prosperity, and the other years when the
community is whipping the cat.

amount a 5, or 6, or 7 p.c. div. will call f .
Twelve months ago, after the coal strike, a div. at tne
rate of 5 p.c. per annum was declared for the uait-
vear; and that brought the year’s div. down to 6 p.c.
For the half-year just passed the old 7 p.c. rate is
reverted to. The co.’s business has been growing
pretty fast: in 1907 the gross revenue was £8705; it
was £12,267 for the past year. Certainly the co.
has been getting in a little more capital, and thus
extending its mains and works; but after making
allowance for that, an improvement is shown. Alto-
gether the position seems to be solid; depreciation
looks to be well provided for, and the dividend is
verv comfortably earned. Liabilities total <L7oio,
liquid assets (including stock) total £3712. Most of
the debt has been incurred for plant during the past
- vear - .
The Pinnacles, one of the Barrier’s early-
day rivals of Broken Hill, is likely to have another
trial. There is a big body of ore in the mine, but it
is so refractory that half a dozen cos. have emptied
their pockets over it. A Broken Hill syndicate,
which knows just about all that is known about
silver-lead metallurgy, thinks that flotation can
answer the riddle; and it is whipping up the capital
to take the mine on a 10 years’ tribute, and put up
the necessary plant. The last people who worked it
ran it in conjunction with the disastrous Aldershot
(Q.) smelting works; and after that it was sup-
posed to have fallen into the maw of some of the
Rothschildren, who held the usual little mortgage.

presumably, the deal with F. H. Snow will go
through if the report of the latter’s expert is satis-
factory. #

Dividends totalling £528,931 were paid by
the Westralian gold mining cos. for the first eight
months of this year, as compared with £658,643 for
the same term in 1910. The total amount distributed
since the industry started is £21,890,334, or about
one-fifth of the total production.
* * * *
To date Meekatharra (W.A.) has yielded
something over 180.000 oz. fine gold, and it is the
only field in the West whose returns steadily in-
crease. Its backbone-producers have been Fenian
(53,7830 z.), Ingliston Extended (32,7990 z.), Mar-
mont (27,6610 z.), and Ingliston Consols (27,3720 z.).
The management of the first-named show denies the
report, which recently reached The Bulletin,, that
the bottom level is giving some concern.
* * * *
Bullfinch West (W.A.) has bought the
King of the Hills outright, on the recommendation
of its manager, and is now trying to instil hopes
into its faint-hearted shareholders. The manager
thinks the venture may be very profitable under care-
ful management; but what proved to be a good
living for the former individual owner may not be
sufficient to keep a co. from want for any length of
time. It is doubtful if it will.
Yuanmi Co. (W.A.) has suuk to 450 ft.,
and is getting ready to open out at or near that
depth. Both ends of the mine have developed well;
and 10 head of stamps are being hurriedly fixed, m
the hope that treatment may start before Christmas.
* * * *
Great Fingall (W.A.) finds it impossible
to haul sufficient ore from the deep winze workings,
below No. 13 level, to keep the mill fully occupied,
so it intends to hang up a portion of the plant until
the internal shaft-connections are made. Meantime
the gold yield will be helned by returns from a small
plant which has recently been erected to re treat the
sands around the old 60-head mill. The new shoots
lately exposed at the No. 17 and No. 18 levels, and
in the winze below the latter point, are stated to
be something out of the ordinary, and to have given
the mine a decidedly improved appearance at depth.
Payne’s Find (W.A.) is beginning to at-
tract the attention of promoters, and already pros-
pectuses are blazoning the reports of interested
parties. Nothine' so far discovered on the field war-
rants anything beyond a prospecting co., and appear-
ances are not too favorable as regards permanency.
Westralia values its production of miner-
als, other than gold, to July 31, at £2,816,641.
Last year’s output shows a small decrease compared
with that for 1909, though in two or three cases
there were substantial increases. Coal production
grew from £90,965 in 1909 to £113,699 in 1910,
and copper ingot and matte from £45,100 to
£68,657. On the other hand, tin tumbled from
£62,989 to £45,129. The promised increased out-
put of copper from Whim Well is expected to com-
pensate for the temporary stoppage of production at
Phillips River, while the completion of the railway
to the Pilbarra field, and the promise of better times
at Greenbushes, are exnected to improve the output
of tin.
Wodgina, in the nor’-west (W.A.), has
livened up again, and very promising finds of al-
luvial and lode tin have been made within a mile or
two of the old workings.
* * *
Mount Morgan is still suffering from in-
sufficient blowing power. Four furnaces were at
work through part of August, and the output of
matte got ahead of the blowers. Consequently, A 7000
worth of matte produced in August did not reach the
converters that month. Things should improve when
the new blowing machinery is installed in November,
though general manager Richard won’t be quite
happy till the arrival of the turbo generator, at the
beginning of next year. # #
Gilmore (N.Q.) put through 200 tons for
21 tons tin concentrates; value undeclared. this
crushing is the result of much hard work; but, un-
fortunately, it has struck the metal market on the
fall Vulcan’s 323 tons for 20 tons oxide, worth
£1602, indicates a low-grade concentrate, worth
about £BO per ton, whereas Stannary Hills 22 tons
(from 2566 tons ore) were worth £2500, or over
£lOO per ton. Nevertheless, Stannary continues in
the dumps, because it can’t run its mill full time
and cut down costs. * # #
Still they come. Every tenth man one
meets in Central Bananaland has a coal mine up his
sleeve. Blair Athol Extended is the latest to be
added to the growing list of baby cos.—most of
which are foredoomed through the insufficiency of
their capital. ' *
“Kobbi”: Admiralty Mammoth Co.—a
small subsidiary concern under the wing of the
Bluff Colliery Co. (Q.)—has struck coal at 85ft.
from the grass-roots, and is busy getting the first in
stalment ready for the naval people. Naturally the coal
“is better than was got previously on the same
leases. #
Bundaberg (Q.), which is mostly con-
cerned with sugar strikes and severe frosts, has Uken
a hand at mining. A seam of coal has been tapped
three miles from Yandaran, which is 18 miles by
railway from the sugar centre. The seam, struck
at 50ft., is 3ft. thick, but is on a pretty steep dip.
Navigable water is only five miles off, so the show, if
it has any backbone at all, has good chances.
* * * *
The Batavia rush, in the far-north of
Queensland, hasn’t drawn a crowd; at the last count
there were only 56 whites working atthcrclaims
The biggest slug to date is 740 z., credited to White
and Foley, who have also got 470 z. and 15oz pieces.
The scratcher’s chief trouble is the high cost of liv-
ing Provisions come from Coen, 80 miles off, and
the horse-packers are making money while the nug-
gets shine. #
Brilliant Deep, Charters Towers, has had
the long-expected development in No. 4 west, ihis
level, after being driven 284 ft., entered formation
carrying leaders, and subsequently passed through a
good make of stone. A crushing of 67 tons re-
turned £336. It is not known how far this fine
reef will extend along the course of the channel.
No. 2 got into very heavy stone and caused a run
on shares; but the good thing proved fragmentary,
and defective ventilation made it difficult to worn
the reef to advantage. This make of stone is a long
wav from the Brilliant Extendedin fact, it is in a
different lease to the one that adjoins the Extended,
and whose forfeiture has been applied for by its
covetous neighbor.
* * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, pays
a sixpenny on October 13. There are 250,000 shares,
on which 9s. 6d. altogether has been paid, lhe
present output is at the rate of 1000 tons per week,
but this cannot be sustained for long unless reserves
are replenished, as the stone in sight in May was
only 50,000 tons. The co. owns a fine plant, and is
anxious to secure ground to the west, where its
levels follow the reef nearly to the Deep’s boundary,
and to the north and east, where there is a chance
of extending the Deep levels. Last half-year’s return
was 26,760 tons crushed and 23,600 tons cyanided
for £55,461. Costs were £1 17s. sd. per ton.
Since the half-year closed, in May, better form has
been shown, and the co. has declared two 6d. divi-
dends, costing £12,500. # #
The Great Fitzroy Mines, Ltd., is a three-
year-old reconstruction of the Great Fitzroy Gold
and Copper Mines, Ltd. The latter received 374,512
shares paid to 18s., and £37,451 was then paid by the
shareholders to the new co. That amount being
found insufficient, £75,488 was raised by further
share issues, making the total share capital £450,000.
Another £75,000 has been raised on debentures, and
£20,000 has been advanced by a metal co. A great
deal of the outlay has been due to bad miscalcula-
tions ; and the worst feature of the business is that,
after all, the co. can’t show a profit. For the 12
months to June 30, the working account showed a
loss of £1176. Add debenture interest, and man-
agement and general exes., and you get a loss of
£9837 for the year, without allowing anything for
depreciation; and the directors reckon £17,898 a
fair thing to write off on that account. That would
make a total loss of £27,735 for the year. The
future is still uncertain. At recent copper prices it
was found unprofitable to work the concentrating
mill; but readjustments have improved recoveries a
trifle, and sooner or later a payable practice may
be hammered out. The bulk of the known reserves
is silicious ore worth 3.07 p.c. copper and 2.53dwt.
gold (=47s. 6£d. per ton) ; but the recovery, even
with the help of the flotation process, amounted to
only 81i p.c. of the copper and 47i p.c. of the
gold • and that concentrate has, of course, to be
smelted, and the smelting is expensive (20s. 9.27 d.
per ton, including transport to furnace). Total
working costs ran last year to £1 18s. 6.13 d. per
ton. The metal is there: over 590,000 tons of. ore,
worth 465. 7d., are measured. The problem is to
increase recoveries, or decrease costs, far enough to
show a profit. * » *
A nice button of gold has been got by old-
timer Bren at Rushworth (Vic.). Rush worth had its
rush half a century back, since when it has been
living on the yields from its broad acres. Now all
is hustle again, because one of Bren’s kiddies picked
up a bit of gold-bearing quartz in the back yard.
Bren sank a couple of feet, got on to a vein of
auartz, and resumed his mining career, with a yield
of 1230 z. from two loads of dirt. The State school soon
emptied, every toddler having turned out on the line
of lode, to crack up bits of quartz or gouge for in-
dicators. Bren’s find is next door to the old South
Devon, which was worked down in floors for good
returns till water beat out the parties. The shoots
are too short to pay cos. ; but when got they make
the hatter happy. # *
The usual piffling little row has closed
down Mount Lyell mine and works A party of men
had a contract, and the local A.M.A. thought these
contractors were working more than eight hours a
day. A union official said he would find out the
strength of it, so after coming off shift, he went
back into the mine—which is against the rules
and interviewed the party. . What sort of am
view it was can best be judged by the fact that
there was a fight next day. This fight got the busp
ness much talked about;, and being , m uch talked
about, Sticht seems to have been driven to take
notice of it, and the union official was sacked for
breaking the rule prohibiting trespass. That Was
the whole cause of the trouble. The A.M.A. de-
manded its man’s reinstatement; Sticht said he
would sack himself before he would do that. Within
24 hours the original small row was hidden m a
cloud of allegations and claims and denials and
whirling language; and the Government of tne Speck
was groping in the whirlwind to try to find a jug of
water to pour on the trouble. #
John McWhae, M.L.C., has gone to show
his bald head to the little brown brother who is
being civilised in the Philippines by Brother Jona-
than. McWhae created the Philippine Dredging Go.,
a proprietary concern. All that comes out about it
is that it has a capital of £150,000, of Which the
odd number of 44,600 shares are in reserve, 1 here is
also a £30,000 issue of debentures. What is the
substance of it all, only those on the inside know.
Being a proprietary concern it has no call to pitcn
out balance-sheets or tell anything more than it
cares to. This has its drawbacks —you can t get a
free market for scrip in such a co. on any Stock Ex-
change in Australia. Still, if knobs of gold are
picked up in the Paracale River, John McWhae isnt
the man to keep the good news to himself —or the
good thing itself, for that matter. Before quitting
Collins-street he had a great send-off; and when he
gets to his tropic island he won’t want a better intro,
than his smile, though he is sure to have a parchment
of two in his bag to tell all whom it may concern
that this is our trusty and well-beloved Councillor
John, etc., etc.

The main trouble with the Collie (W.A.)
coal hitherto won has been that it has been about
4,000,000 years too young. However, there is now a
likelihood of harder, older fuel being found by
deeper sinking, and Expectation has got up on its
stilts. At the West Collie Colliery, the other day, a
second seam, 10ft. thick, of improved quality, was
unearthed in sandstone under the mam workings.
Furthermore, some recent discoveries of coal down
Donnybrook way, some 30 miles or so south-west of
the, Collie field, have called for a revision of opinion
as to how far the fuel really extends. As the interven-
ing region is dense jarrah forest, through which it is
inconvenient to drag boring apparatus, this basin has
hitherto escaped much prospecting with the drill.
But the next few months should see the carbon cry-
stals biting deeper, and the real extent of the field
ascertained. „

Douglas Mawson, who specialises in
radium and Poles, has made a report on the Radium
Extraction Co.’s property at Mount Painter —the far
northern S. Aus. show that he had already enthused
about in the papers. “With a profit of £lOO per
ton, the 250 tons now in sight at No. 6 would return
£25,000,” says the explorer. No doubt; but the
profit of £lOO per ton isn’t demonstrated too clearly.
Two things are still in doubt; the cost of extraction
and the market value of the product, and both are
of the utmost importance. #
The Mystery Flat dredge commenced
operations on the river flat, a couple of miles below
Waikaia (M.L.). It is now working at the foot of
Moffett’s Gully—about 60ft. above its original posi-
tion, and looking down on the township. It depends
for its water supply on a siphon pipe carried across
an intervening gully. The performance of the master
and crew in thus raising their craft is probably
unique. Apparently there’s nothing to stop dredging
on any mountain range, provided water can be con-
veyed there.

By all the Tory rules of the game, capital
should by this time be so scarce in Australia, and
especially in N. S. Wales, that it ought to be diffi-
cult to finance as much as a new hot-pea barrow.
Something, however, seems to have gone utterly
wrong, as usual, with the Tory rules, for the City
of Sydney proposes to tell J. Bull that there is so
much available local capital that it intends to raise
£360,000 in Australia, and pay off three old I O U s.
Most of the old loans were raised in 1887 for street
and town hall purposes, and £2lOO a year has been
paid in to a sinking fund. “The council has de-
cided to leave this sinking fund investment undis-
turbed [it now amounts to £BB,OOO, earning 4 p.c.]
and to continue the annual payments until the
maturity of this new issue, when the sum will be
more than the amount to be redeemed.” In other
words, there is so much money awaiting investment
in “Labor-cursed” Australia, that the City Council
is asking for the whole £360,000, instead of using
the £BB,OOO in hand to pay off part of the old
debt; and it is going to allow the £BB,OOO to go
on earning 4 p.c. in order to .assist in presently
wiping out the present loan, which it hopes to get
at 3i p.c. or less. It is all a horrible reflection on
the prophets who predicted financial disaster under
Labor Government. Also, by the way, the City
Council’s sinking fund, of about | p.c. p.a., is a
horrible reflection on the State Government s sink-
ing fund, of mostlv nothing at all p.a. *
The prospectus of the Australian Coking
and By-products Co. is being issued simultaneously
in Australia and England. The co. is in 200,000
shares; 14,500 go to the vendors m part-payment for
various contracts which have been secured, 100,000
are offered to the public, and 85,500 are reserved.
The 100,000 shares are offered at 2s. 6d. on applica-
tion, 2s. 6d. on allotment, and ss. one month after
allotment; the balance in calls as and when required.
Of the £50,000 represented by the first payments,
£5500 in cash goes to the promoters lor the con-
tracts before-mentioned; £16,000 goes to the Con-
tract Loan and Trust Corporation for undertaking
the payment of the preliminary exes, except broker-
age • and the whole 100,000 shares are underwritten
for 7* p.c. in cash. The eo.’s objects are “to carry
on the business of manufacturers of and dealers in
coke, coal tar, pitch and other by-products of coal,
and it is proposed to erect a modern coking and by-
product plant at Hexham, near Newcastle (N.S.W.).
Anything between 200,000 and 300,000 tons of coke
is produced annually in N. S. Wales, but nowhere in
Australia are the valuable by-products recovered.
Professor Galloway, a noted English expert, con-
cludes his report on the undertaking as follows:
“No better subject for the erection of a first-class
coking and by-product installation has ever come
before me. The demand for coke in Australia ap-
pears to be increasing, and, as your co. will produce
a high-class compressed coke, it is bound to occupy
a foremost place in the ranks of Australian coke-
makers I feel satisfied, therefore, that, with even
only moderately good management, the enterprise
will assuredly command success.” It is assumed that
the co. would handle 95,000 tons of washed coal
p.a. ; and Professor Galloway, on that basis, figures
this way.— REC EIPTS.

The contracts include one with the A. A. Go. for the
supply of 75,000 tons of small coal p.a. for 20 years,
another with the Wickham and Bullock Island Co.
for 15 000 tons p.a., and a third with the East
Greta for 10,000 tons p.a. “No coking coal known
to me in this country or on the Continent,” says
Professor Galloway, “gives so large a percentage of
volatile by-products, and at the same time produces
so much good, hard, silvery coke.” The chief by-
product is ammoniacal liquor, Which can be sold in
Australia at 4d. per lOOoz. of 80oz. strength. This,
it is calculated, means 2s. lid. per ton of coal coked.
It is mentioned that the Ammonia Co. of Australia
has offered to contract for the whole output of am-
moniacal liquor at the 4d. per lOOoz. mentioned
above. “Your co.,” says the British expert,
“should be able to rely upon an annual trading
profit of £28,038, which would, after making
all necessary allowances for administration, deprecia-
tion, etc., be sufficient to pay dividends of more than
15 p.c. p.a. upon a share capital of £120,000.’ _ The
Australian brokers are Jones and Buzacott, of the
Sydney Stock Exchange, and E. L. and C. Baillieu,
of Melbourne.*

Every engineer in charge of factories ana mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in
transmission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller
Bearings save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent,
of oil, so one of the first duties is naturally for
engineers to direct their special attention to these
bearings and to car boxes for trucks. Hyatts are
in continuous use in Cement Works, Ore Dressing
Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bushings o\
flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or
truck wheels, etc. Should engineers require further
details, they can apply to the Australian Agents,
W. & J. Lempriere, Melbourne; or E. W. Hurst-
house and Co., of Wellington, the agents in Ne-v
Zealand.*

The undisputed benefit of asbestos covering for
steam-pipes and boilers has been exemplified by a re-
cent scientific treatise of the principles of steam
conveyance. Tests made have established the fact
that 100 square feet of pipe covered with this
material, at a pressure of 2001b. per square inch, and
coal at 16s. per ton, will save £7 per year, and
prevent loss of pressure equal to 13.84 B. Th. U. per

The most modern, simple and effective Vacuum
Slimes Table is the “Wilfley.” It is continuous, and
consists of a revolving drum which is partly submerged
in a tank of slimes or material to be filtered. The
drum is covered with a filter cloth supported on
grooves on the drum, which are connected by means
of holes to the interior to allow the liquid to be
withdrawn. Through the trunnions at the ends of
the drum the vacuum pipe passes to the interior.
This pipe connects with the interior of the drum,
through which the liquid and air are withdrawn by
means of a vacuum pump. The filtered slime is re-
moved by a simple apparatus placed at or below the
level of the pulp in the tank. So that directly the
cake is removed, the surface of the filter cloth as it
revolves is immediately re-immersed in the pulp
ready to receive a fresh cake, thereby preventing the
sucking in of air, and consequent loss of vacuum
between the time the cake is removed _ and a fresh
one is forming. The residual liquid in the slime
cake is removed by distributing water over the sur-
face of the semi-dried cake. Owing to the fact that
the filter is circular in form, it will be seen that it
is continuous in operation, and has no complication
of valves to get out of order ; furthermore, work is
being done continuously during the whole revolution
of the filter drum. The Austral Otis Engineering
Company, of South Melbourne, have the sole manu-
facturing rights of this filter.* [2

To nurse sick people you
must love the work—you can’t
only just like it —you must really
love it. Imagine watching hour
after hour with no sound to break
the stillness of the night, save
the breathing of a poor sick child
—Get on your nerves? I should
say it does! Indeed, there are
times when I feel I simply can’t
keep at it any longer; but I do.
It’s work that just fascinates one;
and when your heart’s in the right
place you simply can’t give it up.
Of course, I sometimes feel out of
sorts, but then I just take a cup
of tea and a rest, and I’m alright
again. Nothing seems to pull me
together like a cup of real good
tea, but it must be hot, very hot,
and "Robur” is the tea I like
best; it’s flavour is pleasing, it is
wonderfully refreshing, and being
absolutely pure tea, there’s no
fear of it doing anybody any
harm.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
~ Sydney, September 25, 1911.
My Dear Arini, —
The Pill and Porous Plaster Party has
been vigorously prayed for in all the
churches in this city, and filled with food,
at frequent intervals, in the gilded premises of
the Rich. In return, it has exuded learning
per medium of the daily press, and sprinkled
clinics and other medical meat over the
breakfast bacon of the average citizen. As
a consequence, that person now eyes with
fierce suspicion the family history and dis-
reputable antecedents of the pig, and meets
the morning milk with threatening language.
The Acting-Gov. Cullens gathered together
at a garden party, last week, about 800 doc-
tors and their feminine belongings—a serious
affair heavily ballasted with silk hats. The
medical aggregation did not take along its
best bedside manner, and it showed a deter-
mination of grass to its feet, for it deve-
loped a habit of getting rooted to small
patches of green velvet lawn while its ladies
preened their plumage amongst the flower
beds, lhe sawbones in the front row of
bone-sawing is a busy person, who resents
the attempts of his Missus to drag him into
dress parades, and the average Male Person
at the garden spree looked cheerful enough to
have been prescribing for his own last
moments.
The G.-G. Denmans, with their Giant
Warrior Staff—disguised in the silk hat of
peace and plenty and other suitable attire—
materialised at the Cranbrook party late in
the afternoon. ller tall Ex.—adorned that
day in a soft shimmer of ivory satin under a
film of blue and rainbow—overtops her lord,
and shows the same brisk attention to busi-
ness that marks the G.-G. Denman manner.
The usual half-dozen persons were trotted
up to the Presence, or carefully betook them-
sejyes to the edge of the Sacred Circle, and
lUOO taxpayers (or thereabouts) did picket
duty in turn, so as to get a first-hand im-
pression of the New Importations.
The two handsome Delilahs, Eleanora de
Cisneros and Marie Ranzenberg, were the
largest ladies present at the garden fete.
Eleanora-Delilah, a beautiful cream cloth
tower of female charm, waved the other half
of an ostrich farm on her head—the half left
over when a Seaforth Highlander has fixed
up his fighting millinery. Austrian Marie
Ranzenberg has imbibed the English lan-
guage with much success, and spreads it
over her remarks with a faint foreign flavor.
Two Delilahs,” muttered a Man of Medi-
cine, gazing at the grand opera duet of
witchcraft. “This is no place for me,” and
he fled to the shelter of the tea tent.
Mrs. Scot Skirving, one of the belles
of the occasion, was up to the last
dying moments of fashion in wonderful
draperies of cream satin, and her lovely
mane of golden hair was coiled in ropes
round her head. Mrs. P. J. Collins, another
handsome dame at the Cranbrook party, had
escaped, like Eleanora, with a handful of
what tail the ostrich had left, and tossed
long feathers of black and gold on her big
hat. Mrs. G. Lane Mullins achieved a
powder blue robe that exploded in Oriental
trimming.
Mrs. Carty Salmon, who flitted over with
her husband from the Cabbage Patch, was a
radiant young matron in black and white.
Miss Norrie matched her eyes with a gown
of periwinkle blue. Mrs. A. J. Brady wore
one of the events of tfie afternoon, a miracle
in blue and green floral silk which changed
its colors like a chameleon.
Dr. Helen Sexton, who is over from the
Cabbage Patch for the Porous Plaster Party
and Amputating Conference, dived into medi-
cine, with distinction, in the earlier days of
prescriptions in peticoats. She turned a’seri-
ous profile to the cMffons of last week, and
looked as much at home at a garden party as
a deep-sea fish in a tub of blue water.
Dr. Mary Booth, who formerly inspected
the eyes of State school children in these
parts, and now inquires similarly in Victoria,
scampered over to take a share in the Senna
Argument.
The lady who handles knives and forceps
wagged her tongue to practical purpose
where the medicoes were gathered together,
and one of Queensland’s women doctors,
Eleanor Bourne, got away last Thursday
with some plain tales of legs and arms. Dr.
Bourne put her learned finger on the same
spot that gymnast Alcide Capitaine assaulted
}“ this letter a few weeks ago—the languid,
ladylike movements which, in many girls’
schools, are branded “physical culture.”
Let boys and girls exercise together,” was
the Queensland medicine lady’s challenge to
the type of school marm who considers legs
indelicate on anything but a grand piano.
Female draperv this spring is working its
way back to Quaker colors —dove-grey, and
faint lavender. Two all greys, in front of
competition at one of the Epsom Salts assem-
blages, were owned by Mrs. Walter Clark
and Mrs. Kenna.
Mrs. An till Pockley, Mrs. Steer Bowker,
and Mrs. Armstrong, executive organiser of
the ladies’ entertainment committee, are re-
to be . snatching five minutes’ sleep
after the Medical Congress flutter, which re-
duced even meek men to strong language and
oyster suppers. The post-office clock col-
lapsed under the strain. It broke down at
r U past 8, and had a surgical operation on
its inside before it gave another tick. Invi-
tation cards for some Pill parties also fell
down exhausted a day or two before the last
disease germ had been dissected in the Medi-
cal School, and had to be supported by the
telephone and other desperate remedies.
The Town Hall, which was laid out in
palms and bunting, and other dressy drapery,
for the British Medical Association’s even-
ing party, broke out in a few acres of scar-
let poppies, two nights later, at the revel
given by Dr. Antill Pockley. Invitations
lor this ball -"ere heavily underlined: “This
card kusT be presented.” Arriving late
from the splendor of “Carmen,” and safely
unloading my pasteboard on the Town Hall
doorstep, I met the ordinary tragedy of life,
the person who has lost the only thing that
at one brutal crisis matters two brass but-
tons. Sometimes it’s a train, or a tram
ticket, or a girl, or a latchkey. This time
it .was the card that had to be laid on the
official palm like a fly in a desert. The
ensuing spectacle—a distressful person in
swallowtails, searching every crevice of his
attire from his cuffs to his boots, while his
lady looked three volumes of home-chat —
suggested the general uncertainty of mun-
dane matters.
President Pockley’s ball was the best-
looking affair of the Medical Shriek. Pop-
pies crawled over every available selection
in the Town Hall, with a flicker of starry
clematis amongst the red riot. The decora-
tive scarlet blooms made a flame of color
that sprawled across the atmosphere till it
reached the pale pink petticoats that draped
the white electric arcs in the City Fathers’
roof. When the great procession trailed out
of the ballroom, two by two, its head was
somewhere amongst the daffodils in the base-
ment, while its tail was whisking out of the
ballroom.

The Gov.-Gen., with Mrs. Pockley, was
ahead of her Ex. That lady was garbed
in brocade, in a faint tone like the pink
skin of a sun-kissed apricot, and wore her
fair hair in a nest of curls under a
blaze of diamonds. This splendid ap-
pearance was taken down to the flower-
trimmed supper by President Pockley.
Lady Barttelot, a fairy beauty in blue;
the acting-Gov. Cullens; Gentlemen Helps;
the Naval Rollestons; Medical Congress
upper crusts; and a municipal fringe, made
a Noah’s Ark procession—two by two, after
their official kind—which was one of the
pageants of the great Bolus Gathering. Dr.
Sinclair Finlay’s large and handsome lady,
in heliotrope and diamonds, had her decora-
tive ninon top-dressed in one of the new
devices —narrow bands of silk, laid out in
tiny rosettes.
A good Australian man sends me some
Yankee fashion notes from N’York or there-
abouts :
There are no ’orny-’anded sons of toil in the
United States. They all wear gloves, even the
Dagos. (Every European with a touch of color
in him is a Dago ; and the Dago population is in-
creasing at the rate of about a million a year, thus
swelling the clay feet of the Yankee Colossus.) The
smallest shop in the smallest town will have a
hundred varieties of gloves for the working man,
from five cents a pair up to a dollar and a-half.
Can you imagine “Billy” Hughes’s team of wharfies
fitted up in gauntleted gloves, adorned with yellow
rosettes or scarlet fringe? Here it would be ab-
normal to see them without these things. But each
man is entitled to wear what he pleases. There
seems no self-consciousness about anyone. In a
crowded city you may see a girl riding her horse
astride, dressed in a velvet costume, a revolver on
her hip, and no hat on her head—or if she has one
it is of the Boy Scout variety. On the pavements
are dozens of women without hats; young, middle-
aged. and old. With you on the tram car is a
young fellow in velvet corduroy trousers, coat, passion-
ate socks, dirty boots, hair as long as Paderewski’s,
and a hat of any shape, fantastic or otherwise—
barring the “plug.” Of the latter, I have seen’ only
one specimen on a citizen. (I except the cabmen of
San Francisco, who wear them. But they are not
citizens; they are bandits, licensed by the law to
rob any passenger they get into their unholy hands.)
The next specimen of man has pants 18in. wide at
the leg-top, turned up 4in. at the narrow bottom,
the turned-up part stitched so that it won’t fall
down. Whatever else he may have on, his hair is
usually long enough to make a prize merino proud,
and his boots are dirty. Hotels don’t clean your
boots unless you specially order it to be done, and
then it costs 10 cents a time. Servants here won’t
clean boots, so the morning tram is full of dirty
boots and unshaven beards. The cities are full of “boot
shine parlors,” and mere man, if he finds time dur-
ing the day, gets his boots cleaned in the city. As
is well known, every good American man never has
much time, hence the men of America are to be
noted for dirty boots and two-day beards. I am
talking of the great mass, not of the 5 or 6 per cent,
who keep themselves tidy. The women are much
smarter in appearance, but given to wearing wild
and woolly hats and very short skirts. As they have
well-shaped boots, and are mostly built like Charles
Lever’s Mullingar heifer, the tout ensemble isn’t what
a man would seriously object to.
The Shakspearian ball in aid of St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital, one of the gilt-edged events
of Race Week, occurs in the Town Hall on
October 3, and will be heavily spangled with
stars, garters, coronets and other baubles.
The G.-G. Denmans are going to bestow
their presence on the Cause, and the Scarlet
Giants of the G.-G.’s staff will also be on
view. Most of the ladies and gentlemen
7 wu USUally i* r^ slde J n 'Sh'akspeare editions
(cloth or calf bound) will be represented in
new and expensive fancy togs. Mrs T H
ReHy is stage managing a King Lear'set,'
and Miss O Connor (she’s a tall, slim
daughter of the High Court’s R. E. O’Con-
nor) is pushing “Much Ado About Nothing”
into place.
The Army Medical Corps rally in Vic-
toria Barracks, on Friday afternoon, was
gently rained on without serious fatalities,
though much chiffon had to be caged up in
the drill hall, the Garrison Hospital grounds
(the place in which the party had intended
to be garden) being too sloppy for outdoor
exercise. The Denmans explored the gun-
ners’ sick room hostel, and cheerfully swal-
lowed tea in an atmosphere of splints, band-
ages, etc.; catching their own private ambu-
lance, later on, without any cotton wool
round their feet.
Miss Emily Meston is going to show her
brush work —chiefly portrait studies —on Oc-
tober 3to 5. Various hostesses will take a
hand in diluting Art with hot tea, and the
kettle is going to boil over at the sign of
Pathg Frhres, 51-53 Elizabeth-street, each
day, at 4 p.m.
Artist Rupert Bunny’s lovelv ladies are
hanging in their frames, on the walls in
Lawson and Little’s showrooms. These
beauties in oils reveal the feminine creature
in most of her moods, but Bunny buries the
feline claw, and he never allows great grief
to scratch crowsfeet on the prettv faces of
his subjects. Bunny’s favorite model is his
wife, whom he believes to be the most ador-
able person he has ever met.
Mrs. Bunny, who is French, lives on can-
vas as the lovely lady in the foreground of
the picture, “A Summer Morning,” bought on
the first day of the show for the Sydney
National Gallery. The trustees stamped up
to “A Summer Morning,” looked at the girls,
the kittens, the green shutter, the size,
weight and general quality of the merchan-
dise, and did a deal on the spot, exchanging
two smaller Bunnys recently acquired in
Melbourne for the green and white glory of
“A Summer Morning.”
Mrs. Theodore Watson, on a holiday trip
from Melbourne, and Mrs. Whiting and her
artistic daughter wrung the Bunny hand
when the trustees said, “Done,” or some-
thing of the kind. R. A. Society artists lined
up to “shake,” and the Bunny manner, which
is one of the youngest things still left in a
rather blase world, effervesced.
“No, really I’m not a Frenchman —what?
Heard I was naturalised? No! I live
chiefly in Paris; our home is there, but I
preferred to remain a British subject, though
the French Government could have given
me work had I become naturalised, which,
otherwise, only a French artist can do.
Bunny is a trying name—at least I thought
so when I was a schoolboy in Victoria, and
afterwards I almost thought of changing it.
However, I decided to remain Bunny to the
end. When I left Australia I went to Paris
with my father (my mother seemed to think
I had some artistic ability), and studied
under Jean Paul Laurens. Longstaff was in
Paris about that time. By the way, I went
up to the R. A. Society’s picture show, the
other day, and was much struck with Long-
staff’s work there —the Portrait of a Lady
(Mrs. R. Broomfield). It’s so sparkling,
and the treatment of the drapery is so clever
that it comes very close to Sargent.”
Artist Bunny has been 26 years away from
his native patch, feels about 16, doesn’t in-
tend to grow any older, is enchanted with
Sydney (seen for the first time last week),
and is the proud possessor of a wife who is
“a magnificent art critic and a good cook.”
The modern male novelist, like the late
Emil Reich, puts Woman under a micro-
scope, and cheerfully sticks pins into her as
an entirely new specimen of the tribe. Thus
Paul Neumann in “The Lone Heights” : “An
unmarried girl is always in fear of Mrs.
Grundy, and, when she marries, becomes
Mrs. Grundy.” Or, “A girl cannot be too
pretty, and she can’t have too good a figure,
but she can be too clever.” W. J. Locke gets
his muscle up in “The Glory of Clementina
Wing” by inserting a hatpin. “It’s all very
well to give a man a vote; he is a trans-
parent animal, and you know the way the
dunderhead is going to use it; but the incal-
culable and pyrotechnic way in which woman
will use it will make humanity blink.”
The Ben Davies-Esta d’Argo concert sea-
son opened fire in the Town Hall the other
night, behind a barricade of blossoms. This
was the vegetation handed up to the re-
turned wanderer —the Hetty Holroyd of 10
years ago—who has battalions of friends in
this city. The lady brings back the same
smile, the same powerful and flexible voice—
beautiful in the quality of its middle regis-
ter —and the same thin patch wearing
through the top notes, which float down
the years as a concert memory of the Hetty
Holroyd of long ago. Esta has developed
into a ballad singer, of considerable charm,
and her warble in Haydn’s lilt, “My Mother
Bids Me Bind My Hair” was a delightful
performance.
Ben Davies, the star tenor of several
thousand candle-power light, is large and
beefy in appearance, and owns a vast voice
that can only be approached with bended nib
as “an organ.” He puts in the soft stops
with sudden and amazing dexterity, is as
agile as a cat in climbing up and down the
voice ladder, and gets a flute-like finish on
to his top-storey tones. These notes excite
all the biggest sticks in the audience to bang
the floor as an encouragement to Benjamin
to hurry up aloft again. Handel’s Recita-
tive, “Deeper and Deeper Still.” with the
exquisite air, “Waft Her, Angels,” was the
strong meat of the concert. When tenor
Davies does get upstairs on his velvet sky-
scraper tones, he closes his eyes, presumably
because he’s one of the persons who can’t
look over the edge of high places without
feeling giddy.
Edward Goll, the pleasing pianist of the
Davies-d’Argo tour, is rather like an en-
larged portrait of Kubelik, with an extra
of°his collar aCk W ° ol falling over the back
Eleanora de Cisneros, as Carmen, is an-
other excuse for the alleged Sorrows of
oatan, the gentleman with the pitchfork
being unable to settle down in sulphur in
company with, such beautiful witchcraft.
JJon Jose-Zeni is bowled over by Gipsy Car-
men (with prolonged applause from every
part of the theatre) early in the opera, and
plunges into the simple life with a gun and
appropriate drapery, amid a magnificent
sta.ge setting of brigands and mountains
with Angelinas fiddlers to keep things mov-
ing. Eleanora-Carmen reveals the true in-
wardness of the Spanish silk fringed shawl
with a garden of silk roses blooming on its
centre, in the glorious drape she wears over
a subtle suggestion of underskirts that flash
the sheen of dull rose. This snare of Satan
puts Don Jose’s last struggle in the dust-
heap of good resolutions.
Melba was in the managerial box on the
first night of “Carmen,” not looking well
after her recent ear anguish.
Journalist John Arthur Barry, of the
Evening News editorial columns, passed
over the horizon of this planet, the other
day, a friend and comrade not easily spared
by those who knew him best. Mariner Barry
put the swish of green seas, the hiss of the
hurricane and the flapping sails of a be-
calmed wind-jammer into his sea stories,
with the ready pen of the man who’d
handled these wild beasts at close quarters.
The Apple Orchard’s rill, that rushes down
from the snow hat of the hills, has now lost
its reputation, and the summer tourist, who
laps up portion of a waterspray to slake his
thirst —the nearest tavern being out of
coo-ee —will continue this form of drink at
his own risk. Tasmania’s Chief Inspector of
Health, Dr. J. S. Purdy, threw a brick at
wandering rills, at the Medical Corroboree,
and accused them of harboring goitre germs
in their limpid shallows. So Tasmanian
trippers will either boil their waterfall, or
swallow their whisky direct from the flask.
Yours, heretofore,
VANDORIAN.


Beauty’s Favourite.
The article which excels all others
in improving' the beauty of the sKin
is naturally and deservedly beauty’s
favourite. This has been the
acknowledged and honoured
position held by Pears’ Soap for
nearly 120 years. It won, and has
maintained that position by virtue
of its complete purity, and by the
possession of those special emollient
properties which soften, refine,
and impart natural colour to the
skin. No other soap possesses
these qualities in such a pre-
eminent degree as

A merry group of chorus girls from one of the city theatres
is enjoying a dip in the briny on a Sunday morning regardless
of the fact that near by stands, scowling, an Anglican par-
son who looks upon the performance as sinful to a degree—
but keeps looking, nevertheless. For the ladies have been
amply endowed by Nature, and are free of their charms; and,
whilst keeping an eye on them, the poor parson literally
“Falls in,” and is rescued by the belle of the bunch. After-
wards she takes him in hand, and makes a man of him,
and shows him a bit of life. How she does it is well worth
finding out, and the inquiring reader will be thoroughly satis-
fied.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, September 25, 1911.
My Dear Yarrie,—
The son of Viscount Gormanston, once
Governor of Tasmania, is, all going well, to
marry a daughter of Lady Butler —the Lady
Butler who painted “The Roll Call.” Jenico’s
family has been in the viscount business
ever since 1475, and has hung on to its
11,000 acres of Ireland for most of the time.
Melbourne Society is rather annoyed at
the G.-G.’s programme of frivols. Accord-
ing to the list, only one hop is to be given
in Melbourne, while Sydney is allotted two.
Some dames are consoling themselves and
friends by reminding them that the ballroom
in the palace by the Yarra holds twice as
many people as the one in the mock castle
by the Harbor, and that the two Sydney
dances merely represent an A to L and L to
/.solution of the crush difficulty.
The numerous Fuller household is still
cooped up in the Malvern home, no more
elbow room having been acquired. It was said,
soon after the beginning of the reign, that
an extra house was to be rented for the
children and aides. Then his Ex. was re-
ported to have said something about canvas
houses in the garden. It sounded idyllic;
but so far nobody seems to have rushed the
fresh air, for no shelters are visible to the
naked eye. Fuller once remarked that he
and his lady had every intention of “seeing
through the whole five years in Australia.”
The brave sentiment was fired off with the
air of a hardy sport, who was roughing it in
the jungle and didn’t give a hang for per-
sonal discomforts and privations.
Mrs. Edward Miller, who has taken Lady
Carmichael’s place as president of the Guild
of Irish Crochet Makers, is also acting as
secretary in the absence of Mrs. Austin.
The departed Governoress, who was herself
an expert with the needle, fanned the en-
thusiasm of promising lacemakers with en-
couraging letters, and was always ready to
swap stitches with anyone. She invited
countrywomen to send along examples of
their work, and opened a market for the
filmy merchandise so attractive to all fe-
males. The Guild has some beautiful ex-
amples of Irish crochet, which will be lent
to good workers on application. Skilled ad-
vice and help is also on tap for those who
are striving after improvement. The organ-
isation is rapidly extending, and the com-
mittee is revising the rules and letting out
the official tucks, so that it will have room
to grow. The lace industry, intelligently
controlled, will enable many women to add
materially to their incomes. In the long
winter evenings much time and energy is
squandered on pretty but valueless fancy
work. The same amount of time and energy
devoted to lace-making would return a nice
profit. A show and sale of Irish crochet (no
other brand need apply) is projected for
next Easter. The exact date will be fixed
later on; but it is not too early to publish
the preliminary announcement, if a satisfac-
torv number of recruits is to be raked up.
The address of the president and acting sec-
retary is Glynn, Kooyong-road, Toorak. The
show, it may be explained, will consist prin-
cipally of loaned examples of Irish crochet;
the sale is purely for the work of Guild
members.
Florrie Finn, daughter of the Melbourne
Punch family, who has been wandering
abroad for the last 18 months, is now headed
for Australia in the Orsova. Besides doing
the frosty Coronation, she has been in a
sandstorm in a desert, and a snowstorm at
Interlaken ; also, she has dipped in the Dead
Sea, strolled round the back ways of Pales-
tine, and struggled to the top of the highest
Pyramid, with the help of only two pale
yellow asistants. (Most people, lam given
to understand, require at least four. Even
Jane, the heroine of “The Rosary,” had a
quartette to tow her up.) The energetic
girl walked many miles through Bull’s dis-
tressful land, and inspected many moated
granges. She intends to pass her experi-
ences on to the public in a book which will
be illustrated by herself.
With the Federal House at work again,
Melbourne streets are gladdened by the old,
well-loved cartoon models. The moustache
of Spruce Myth is observed to be curled
jauntily, and his buttoned boots have a
dazzling shine. The wearer >'* chem com-
plains that he finds cork soles are a necessity
in changeable Melbourne; whereas, on his
weekly return to sunnier Sydney, he is able
to cast them cheerfully aside along with his
macintosh, umbrella and goloshes. It is
almost impossible to look really Spruce when
in wet-weather armor, though one may look
Myth any time.
One of the members of the recent Medical
Congress turned his trip into a honeymoon.
Dr. Harry Stevens married the daughter of
Dr. Coles, of Carlton, early this month, and
fled to Sydney well in advance of his purely
business-iike brethren.
Miss Amy Young is to be married, on
October 12, to Dr. Percy Gore Brett, a
talented and moneyed young man. The cere-
mony happens in Cairns Memorial Church,
and the subsequent refreshments will be
served at Menzies’. The bride-elect is the
last of Tom Young’s bevy of pretty daughters
to dive into matrimony, and the Wimmera
clan is coming down in force from Sunny-
side to assist in the splash.
Rupert Clarke, one hears, is not for long
in Australia this trip. Having exchanged
his active interest in the _ Clarke-Meynell
firm for a passive partnership in the Com-
bine, the restless baronet is not troubling
much about stage matters on this side. The
speculation was good sport while it lasted,
and it brought him a profit 0f.£60,000. But
the Combine has no speculative charms to
speak of. It is just a safe investment. Some
time in February, or March, perhaps, Rupert
will return to the crowded latitudes and
make his headquarters in London perhaps.
Mrs. Charles D’Ebro’s daughter is giving
a smart dance this week; not at the parental
Praedo, but at a Chapel-street hall.
Lord Dick Nevill arrived at the beginning
of the week, and started to have a general
look round the Melbourne establishment, be-
fore going on to Sydney to join the G.-G.
The Willie Felsteads’ fine young Austra-
lian daughter is returning by the Orsova,
after a four years’ “finishing course on the
Continent, presumably with the usual load ot
languages. From a scholastic point of view,
a great disadvantage of this continent is that
we all speak the same tongue, and can under-
stand one another perfectly without gesticu-
lating.
A fine old exclusive house, which stands
in its own garden, well back from Flinders
and Russell streets, is placarded for sale.
It was for years Dr. Rowan’s private hospi-
tal ; after that it became a paying guestery ;
now it is plain boarding-house. Soon it
may be a hash tower. The high,, terraced
wall hides a wilderness garden full of splendid
old trees —a quiet, green, bird-haunted spot
almost in the heart of the city. The boarders
in the old house will probably see the valu-
able garden sold before their windows, even
if the house itself is not auctioned over their
heads, and the birds will have their freehold
allotments in the trees confiscated by human
builders in brick and stone.
The Most Respectable coteries seem to
make it a rule to “take up” Shakspearian
mimes, and look carefully over the heads of
other deserving mummers whose playwrights
are not so dead as Bill of Avon. After the
University had beamed through its spectacles
at the Trvings, the sleek tabbies of the Alex-
andra Club extended a velvet paw, and in-
vited the visiting mimes to dine in the beau-
tifully-papered feeding room, with Mrs.
Emmerton and Mrs. James Murphy as
hostesses. Mrs. Ophelia Irving was made
an honorary member, and given the privi-
lege of lapping m'lk—mixed with tea and
sugar—whenever she had the time to spare.
Sassiety is confidently prophesying a double
engagement in an elevated house. The
wealthy sister of an engaged girl and the
brother of the fianed are being observed with
interest by kindly gossips.
Melbourne’s toniest association of She-
kind was divided into sections recently by
the autocattic action of its tricky rulers.
There are now two parties—the Ins and the
Outs —and if the leader of the Opposition
were to move a vote of want oi confidence
in the Government the voting would be close.
The trouble was born of exclusive snob-
bery, of course. Members of the club have,
the right to engage the big; room —one day a
week—for private entertainment, and these
hiring fees help considerably to pay the
exes, of the swaggah establishment. The
usual notice of an ordinary booking for a
particular date attracted no particular atten-
tion at the time, but subsequently the fact
leaked out, or gushed out, that the commit-
tee had wanted the big room for a reception
to the G.-G. lady, and that only some of
the members had been invited to partake of
the grovel. Whereupon the ignored ones re-
membered that the rules of the club require
every member to get notice when a Person-
age is officially invited. Indignation runs
not high, but deep. “A club, indeed !” says
Mrs. Somebody; “/ call it a snub.”
The Menzies’ Ball, held on Saturday, will
roll a fat bundle of good Commonwealth
notes into the Children’s Hospital treasury
chest. The Chief Justice’s lady acted as
impromptu hostess; for Norman Menzies
had gone down suddenly with influenza, and
his devoted Dorothy Vane wife gave herself
up to nursing him. The Menzies are in
hard luck, with Mrs. Dowager Menzies also
on the sick list. The children danced per-
fectly, offering a contrast to any grown-up
ball, where the dancers are few and the
sprawlers are many. Mrs. Green’s star
pupils gave some special capers. A “Cobra”
girl got the poster prize, and a boy Indian
lassoed another trophy. Esther Barton had
her fair hair plastered back into a periwig,
and looked a dandy Cavalier. The Grand
Hotel Holdens sent along a spick and span
representative; size about and labelled
“Bond-street.” She infatuated a Monsieur
Beaucaire in powdered wig and brocade.
The children were serious people, mostly.
They booked their dances with as much care
and coquetry as any child of 30 or there-
about. Almost the whole of the hotel was
thrown open, and everything was well done.
The living rooms—including even the big
dining-room—were cleared and decorated in
soft-colored flowers and lights.
The Fullers, of State Government House,
would have sent the whole nursery contin-
gent of six to the Menzies’ juvenile fancy
ball, if the frivol had been held in the after-
noon. Unfortunately, the start had been
fixed for 8, and, as the sub-Excellencies have
“Early to Bed”' tacked on the nursery wall,
they bad to regretfully decline. As soon as
the news got round, several mammas in high
life hurriedly cancelled the engagements of
their offspring, on the plea of night air. The
enraged offspring sprang about and howled
dismally, saying, “But you know we went to
Mrs. Blank’s, and to Dodo Money wool’s at
night time!” It was useless. The de-
frauded infants were up against vice-regal
precedent, and Ma blankly refused in every
case to take a reasonable view of things.
Some people are capable of imitating any-
thing.
The Geelong Grammar School has decided
to import a parson headmaster from Oxford,
to fill one of the fattest billets on the educa-
tional market. This painful process of drag-
ging brains from the other side of the world
is liable to give Foglanders the impression
that Miss Australia is a wild, tousled female
with milk cans in each hand, and an un-
rivalled store of natural ignorance. Quite
a lot of people on the other side would listen
with sympathetic horror, if you informed
them that the good G,-G. spent his spare
evenings teaching the hardy pioneers in Col-
lins-street to read and write. The periodical
cry for a University professor or a plain
schoolmaster only goes up to London from
the wild outposts of civilisation — and Aus-
tralia ; so Australia is classed as one of the
wild outposts, and the brave soul who an-
swers the call is wept over at the docks, and
told not to let the kangaroos eat his hair in
the drought. Amongst the 32 “cast” candi-
dates were well-equipped local men of experi-
ence ; but they were all counted out. In
some walks of life it appears to be a consid-
erable disadvantage to be an Australian.
Rita, the eldest hope of the Reggie
Weigalls, gave a smart evening recently at
the ancestral mansion in Elsternwick. Sister
Dora, a blue-eyed brunette with a strong-
sense of humor, made her debut quietly at
the private function. It must have been
the sense of humor that prevented her from
taking the social plunge at a mayoral hop
in company with the usual flock of white-
robed strangers whose photographs are
printed the following week in rows by the
weeklies. During the intervals in the pro-
fessional music, Beryl Fanning lifted up
that flute-like voice which Melba says con-
tains a future. All the same, the Fanning
chick is not likely to leave the nest in order
to go futuring on the stage.
Amy Castles’s sudden throat attack seems
to have suddenly lost its serious aspect.
There was talk of diphtheria, and the date of
Amy’s first farewell concert was postponed
indefinitely. Then the 11th of October was
dimly suggested. But by last Monday the
diphtheria theory had fallen through, and
October 7 was said to be decided on. The
Taits, wdio suffered from shock to their busi-
ness arrangements whilst the songstress was
diphtherialising, got the consolation of a cable
from brother Nevin last Saturday announc-
ing that the seats for Clara Butt’s concert
in Capetown were selling at a premium.
Fanny Dango Mackay, who lately acquired
a little son of her very own, also possesses a
stepson, and a 17-year-old stepdaughter who
is one of the belles of the Glassy Harem.
The Advertising Art Exhibition should be
in full bloom in the Town Hall by the time
The Bulletin has brought its latest issue
to bear on Melbourne’s understanding. Four
o’clock this (Thursday) afternoon is the
time fixed for unlocking the floodgates of
John Madden’s oratory— i.e., the new-born
show’ receives its baptism of John’s honeyed
words at the witching hour when tea-cups
yawn and slaves give up their bread. But
the public w’ill be admitted at three o’clock,
in accordance with the ancient custom of
disclosing an exhibition to view an hour be-
fore the official opener arrives, so that he
may have an audience awaiting him. For
these three days (ending on Saturday night)
everybody worth mentioning in the local
world will prate of posters and be interested
in all pictorial forms of advertising art. For
which relief the Lord make us truly thank-
ful ! There are so many other forms of ad-
vertising art that are not a bit picturesque,
A train which had been clattering and
roaring merrily across country towards the
Medical Congress, now dead and gone, came
to a stop at nowhere in particular with a
heavy bump and a screaming of brakes. The
horde of doctors on board stuck their heads
out of the windows, and were accosted
by a peevish engineer who inquired in
a hopeless tone, “Isn’t there any man here
with an engineer’s certificate? I don't want
a doctor.” Unhappily, there was not
amongst the passengers a person qualified
and able to render the badly-needed first aid
to the engine. So the engineer did his best
single-handed, and after a wild-flower pick-
ing interval by the passengers, “All aboard”
was shouted, and the steam caravan jolted
sulkily on its journey, arriving some hours
late. That engineer would have cheerfully
exchanged a dozen or two dozen first-class
physicians for a man who was competent to
put a blister on a boiler or amputate a
funnel.
Tasmania is sticking hatpins into its
Tourist Bureau, and urging it to wake up
and tell the holiday-maker what a restful
paradise the place is. The Tasmanian no-
bility and gentry have always seen to it that
the streams running through their pro-
perties were well stocked with trout; and as
fish don’t take any heed of fences, and as
tributaries are numerous, the unlanded
angler has plenty of inducement to bait a
hook. Moreover, the streams are mostly
limpid and shallow, and are edged with shade
trees, so that he can fish comfortably and
his wife avoid catching even one freckle.. A
circular trip covering 150 miles is being
arranged that should land the tourist iff
large quantities.
A Bulletin par. is said to have been the
means of reuniting two loving souls. The
story runs this way: A young London medico
hankered secretly for a girl of his acquaint-
ance, but, considering that his brass plate
wasn’t bringing in enough to marry on, he
refrained from proposing. The girl, in the
meantime, was wooed and won by an Austra-
lian. She came out here to visit the fiance’s
relations, and the medicine man was driven
to desperation and hard work. Months went
by, and the engagement suffered a fracture,
which was duly recorded here. A cLpy of
the issue containing the news was. sent to
Fiji, the headquarters of the uncle industry,
and despatched thence to someone in Edin-
burgh. The Scotchman, having a stamp to
spare, sent the well-creased paper to the
man himself in London. He read of the dis-
engagement, threw his silk hat right oyer
the house, and wrote off at Once offering him-
self and his renovated income to the girl.
She sobbed on his shoulder by post, and
started to pack up. Latest reports mention
orange blossom and confetti. Now I am
waiting for a tiny slice of wedding cake.
An October bride, who is now engaged
planning her domestic) scheme, should not
have much trouble on the lower deck, if
dainty frocks and surroundings count for
anything with Marianne. The members of
the house staff in her establishment, are to
be supplied with rose-pink frocks, white caps
and frilly aprons, and should look like de-
lectable strawberry ices. Of course, if the
right sort of maid doesn’t transpire, she will
merely get a beetroot salad effect. The back-
ground of the color scheme is to be green
and white; the kitchen and surrounding
rooms are to be decorated that way, and gen-
erally made to look like the interior of a
spick and span yacht. A matron who had
her orange blossoming a few years ago
turned her kitchen into an artist’s dream
with Dutch blue and white tiles and Dutch
blue china. The servants had a sitting-room
furnished with easy chairs, covered with blue
chintz, and Missus, who is one of the beauty
matrons of Toorak, turned up her sleeves
every morning and helped in the general
tidying-up. Notwithstanding all this, she
only manages to get girls by paying their
cab fare home on three nights a week. Her
husband has just come to the Conclusion that
it will be cheaper in the long run to buy a
motor, and use the travelling gas engine him-
self when Marianne doesn’t require it.
From my Adelaide correspondent: —
On Tuesday afternoon Mrs. Bonython asked the
members of the local Alliance Frangaise to have tea
and admire her garden. The Bonythons inhabit a
big house top Ding Montefiore Hill. It (the house)
was originally built by that Dixon who is now Den-
nison, and who keeps racehorses, newspapers and
other bitter beasts.
The Port Races increase steadily in popularity,
and the crowd which journeyed to the Cheltenham
course last Saturday was such that the provided ac-
commodation was badly overtaxed. It’s not much of
a woman’s meeting, though some of the keener
spirits find (heir way there, and rejoice in it as a
sporting ■ event pure and simple—not a semi-garden
party. Calamus kept up the reputation of the total-
isator by giving his backers £25 11s. for £1 in the
Spring Handicap. In the Flying Handicap, “Dick”
Hawker’s Sacrfi came to grief, and owing to the non-
appearance of the S.P.C.A.’s horse ambulance, there
was some delay in getting the animal to town. It
wasn’t the fault of the S.P.C.A. folk. They’d offered
the Club the use of their ambulance, sbut had been
rebuffed.
v Which reminds me that there has been some fiery
discussion anent Sir Grenville’s smash at the last
Morphettville meeting. Seeing that the S.P.C.A.
makes horses its rather special care, and has pur-
chased an equine stretcher to make things easier
for them, people marvelled when Sir Grenville, with
a leg smashed, was led past the stand and on into
the remote distance before being put out of pain.
It; now transpires that the fault wasn’t the Society’s.
Their vehicle and their inspector were close by
the smash, ready for action, but the racing club’s
vet. took it on himself to lead the animal for a half-
mile stroll —directly away from the waiting ambu-
lance. One hears that something was said about the
impossibility of destroying the creature in front of
the stand, “because of the ladies.’’ Any woman with
a spark of decent feeling would rather see a horse
destroyed than paraded in obvious agony. So that
excuse is worn out.
Hunters had a busy day on Saturday—a before-
breakfast run (with a small field) at Urrbrae in
the morning, and jumping at the Show in the after-
noon. At the latter function Mr. O’Dea’s Top Note
secured first place in both the Open Hunters and the
High Jump, with Mr. F. S. Tom’s new purchase, The
Whip, second in the Hunters. Now that the bi-
yearly rural orgy is over, we’ve returned to some-
thing like normal conditions, and progress in the
streets can be made at the rate of more than a mile
an hour. It’s a fine thing (in some ways) to be
a prosperous State, but it’s distinctly inconvenient
when your cocky backbone elects to hold a mass
meeting in town.
“The Arcadians” have returned. Miss Gilliam and
Miss Linden are among them, so broken hearts should
be as plentiful as leaves on Vallambrosa, or dead
marines at a mayoral banquet.
Mrs. Halcomb (whose husband sees that the law
of precedence is duly observed in the Legislative
Council—he’s its clerk) has been rejoicing in a visit
from two English- sisters. To prove it she gave a
bridge and garden party in their honor.
Preparations for the church pageant continue—
more or less smoothly. Mrs. Albion Tolley is the
secretary. The authorities have abandoned their
original idea of the theatre in favor of the exhibi-
tion building, which takes some filling. The “book”
is the work of Miss ltebeuham, and is on the lines of
the old miracle plays, covering a period of from 550
to 680, so it should be picturesque.
The local Wattle Day League held its first annual
public meeting on Monday, and the report presented
shows healthy activity. Vice-President Sowden sub-
mitted a common-sense suggestion, to federalise the
affair and make it an Australian Wattle Day League,
instead of letting each State go its own way, or
stand still, as it chooses. The idea caught on, and
the N.S.W. and Victorian Leagues are to be ap-
proached.
Recently returned from England is Ronald Angas,
the C. H. Angas’s eldest son. He’s been spending
some years in English ’Varsity life, and is now
booked to take his share in the management of the
estate.
T’other night a parson expressed himself freely
on the subject of feminine head-gear, and stigma-
tised it as an “invention of the Devil to keep men
from seeing the preacher.” -He also remarked that
he had admonished his own wife to get a “decent
kind of hat.” The rev. will probably make things
worse by this ill-advised step. The jelly-bag con-
cerns, which are the alternatives to the Merry Widow
brand of lid, provide priceless shelters for slumber
during dull sermons.
On Sunday the South -African soldiers’ memorial
service was held at the parade ground, and the
statue at Government House gates was hung with
wreaths. There was a very fair muster of troops,
and both the Governor and Lady Bosanquet attended.
Died the other day at Walkerville, an old
identity in the person oi Mrs. Levi. The suburb has
been the home of the Levis for ages.
From the Royal College of Music, London, come
good progress reports concerning Miss Kleinsohmidt,
who was dubbed La Serena, made into a syndicate
and despatched Englandwards for the betterment of
her voice. The syndicate is happy, and says she’ll
pay good dividends. A big voice and an equally
big capacity for work should certainly take her far.
Premier Verran wants to pull down the old (50
years old) and ugly stone wall which surrounds the
vice-regal mansion on North Terrace. The Governor,
however, objects. So there will be nothing doing in
the eyesore-removing line for the present. But be-
fore our next figurehead transpires the deed will cer-
tainly be accomplished.
The pile of bricks and mortar, which is to
be the new University-Conservatorium, is
being gradually trowelled into shape. Melba
and the late Thomas Bent conjointly patted
the foundation-stone some considerable time
back. The edifice has still some ragged edges;
but encouraging signs of hod-carriers and
bricklayers were discernible amidst the fall-
ing moisture.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.


IN Miss Ethel Irving’s performance of the principal part of “Lady
Frederick” in London, the critics were unanimous that here was an actress
of extraordinary resource and character, and the clever play, whose success
had carried it from theatre to theatre during its lengthened run, could scarcely
have achieved such distinction had it not been for the perfectly lovable and
convincing picture drawn by this inimitable artiste.
The scene in which Lady Frederick’s lover is initiated into the mysteries
of complexion “veneering” is a delicious caricature of how the average English-
woman practises her daily beauty culture, and its presentation by Miss Irving
must ever remain a classic.
But in private life Miss Irving knows better. She would abhor the idea
of taking care of her skin in any but the most natural sensible manner. In
the letter here reproduced she attests the merits of Valaze preparation in the
most flattering terms. She pronounces them “perfectly wonderful for the
skin.”
And many of her sisters in the profession
share her opinion, as witness Miss Ellaline
Terriss. She says: “She finds Yalaze a most
valuable preparation, and will most certainly
recommend it.”
Miss Marie Studholme states: “That she
has found Yalaze a very agreeable and valuable
preparation, and can certainly recommend it.”
Miss Lily Brayton, acknowledging the un-
questioned superiority of the Yalaze prepara-
tions, says: “Every woman should use Yalaze
to preserve her complexion.”
Miss Alice Crawford, the beautiful Bendigo
girl, who has been winning increasing fame
with each theatrical season in London, says:
“Your Russian Skin Food, Yalaze, does pre-
cisely what the skin requires. It preserves its
tone, whiteness and clearness as no other pre-
paration has done.”
Thus are the Yalaze preparations spoken
of among the most competent judges.
Valaze Skin Food is an ideal skin correc-
tive, preserves and beautifies. It is Nature’s
own skin replenisher and nourisher. Valaze
stands for freedom from wrinkles, tell-tale lines, drab appearance, freckles,
sallowness and tan. The price of Yalaze Skin Food is 3/6, 6/6, and 6d.
postage.

NEW METHOD OF REDUCING FAT.
A news item from Paris informs us that
the American method of producing a slim,
trim figure is meeting with astonishing suc-
cess. This. system, which has made such a
wonderful impression there, is the Marmola
Prescription Tablet method of reducing fat.
Anything that will reduce the excess flesh a
pound a day, without injury to the stomach,
the causing of wrinkles, the help of exercis-
ing or dieting, or intei’ference with one’s
meals, is a mighty important and useful ad-
dition to civilisation’s necessities. Just euch
a catalogue of good results, however, follow’
the use of these pleasant, harmless and
economical little fat reducers. We say
economical, because Marmola Prescription
Tablets (made in accordance with the fa-
mous prescription), can be obtained of any
chemist for 3/6 (which is a decidedly
economical price, considering the number of
tablets each bottle contains), or sent post
free on receipt of price by the Marmola Co.,
7 Barrack Street, Sydney, N.S.W.
NOTE. —For those who prefer the liquid
preparation, chemists are still dispensing
the famous prescription as follows: One
ounce of fluid Extract of Glycyrrhiza B.P.,
one ounce of pure Glycerine B.P., one half-
ounce of Marmola, and mix with pepper-
mint water to make six ounces in all. The
dose is Uco teaspocnfuls after each meal*

BAD FOR THE SKIN
♦
Rubbing on Greasy Ointments*
How to Properly Treat
Skin Troubles*
It is not a good thing for people with a
tendency to have pimples and a blotchy com-
plexion to smear themselves with greasy
ointments and such things. In fact, they
couldn’t do anything worse, because the
grease only clogs the pores of the skin,
making the complaint worse. When there is
an irritating rash a soothing boracic wash
may help to allay the pain or itching ; but,
of course, it doesn’t cure. Skin complaints
arise from an impure condition of the blood,
and will persist until the blood is purified.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have cured many
cases of eczema and skin disorders because
they make rich, new blood that drives out
the impurities, and imparts a glow of health.
Mr. Robert Davies, of 43 Rathmines-street,
Northcote, Melbourne, tells how these pills
cured him of a terrible attack of Eczema.
“I had a bad attack of Eczema,” said Mr.
Davies. “My poor body was quite raw. I
could not bear anyone to come near me. I
was under the doctor for 12 months, and he
couldn’t cure me. My skin used to burn and
itch something frightful. I was on fire with
it. No one knows how I suffered, only my
wife and myself. I spent pounds and pounds
in medicine, and none of them did me much
good. The trouble used to appear on the
thighs, and on the calves, and most particu-
larly about the ankles. My clothes irritated
the parts dreadfully. It was impossible to
keep from scratching; my skin used to scale
and come off like scurf. I was suffering like
this for about a year when I read that Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills would cure my com-
plaint, and so I bought some and took them
as directed. After awhile the irritation be-
gan to decrease, the skin got less scurfy, and
more healthy looking. I felt better than
ever I did. To-day I am perfectly cured,
and my skin is as clear as it was when I
was born. I can eat and work; in fact, I
am a new man.”
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are 2s. 9d. a box,
6 boxes 15s. 3d., of all dealers, or from The
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. of Australasia

POLITICAL
POINS
MR.
WADE,
of N.S.W.
Assembly—
his present
aspect.
An Echuca-ite writes :
Palmer, who misrepresents Echuca in the House of
Reps., has suddenly raised his voice against Yassberra.
Furthermore, he has just asked the Reps, to pass a
Federal Capital Referendum Bill, before any more
good Australian money is wasted on the Desert City.
Considering that Palmer was one of the anti-Austra-
lians who voted and worked against the Monaro site,
his new attitude occasions surprise. The explanation is
that one William Orr, who opposed Palmer for
Echuca at last election, would have beaten him in
a single-handed go, and intends to contest the seat
again. Orr is, and always has been, strong on a
Federal Capital Referendum, and Echuca is strongly
suspected, these days, of being the same. In fact,
Palmer is stealing Orr’s thunder as a measure of
self-protection.
Chirrup of joy from the S. M. Herald's
Bradford (Eng.) correspondent: —
Leeds does a big over-seas trade in ready-made
garments, and we are glad to note that to South
Africa especially larger quantities of light, but well-
made fabrics are being shipped, while Australia is
appreciating well-made flannels and light fancy
worsteds more than it ever did. In fact, we are in
a position to say that but for the growing trade in
textiles between Australasia, South Africa, Canada,
and the Argentine, not to mention the Far East, the
whole industry of this district would not have en-
joyed the prosperity that we have seen.
Which is a shriek of derision in tlie face of
Australia—the fool country which produces
most of the wo< 1 that, when mixed with
rags, is the basis of the “well-made flan-
nels,” etc., that Bradford is whooping about,
and hasn’t sense enough to keep its product
at home and make its own flannels.
AFTER THE STORM. “ OH, IVHAT A
TIME WE HAD!”
The sort of thing that the Wade push
wanted ex-Minister for Lands Nielsen to
do! Eight years ago the N.S.W. “Liberal”
Government sold the fee simple of some
State land at Cronulla (N.S.W.) for £l5 an
acre. Naturally, in accordance with “Lib-
eral” policy, the money was thrown into con-
solidated revenue and spent. Recently the
same land was sold at £3600 per acre.
“B.” : How these towns hate one another!
A Perth jury gave R. D. McKenzie £lOOO
libel damages against the Kalgoorlie Miner,
and now the Miner asks for a new trial at
Geraldton, the inference being that a Perth
jury can’t be trusted to give a Goldfields
paper a fair show. And the case of Mines
Minister Gregory against the same paper is
to be tried at Albany—presumably on the
same old inference.
Frank Henty: Last week I got this from
the Scripture Instruction Campaign Council
of Victoria: —
Dear Sir, —-We notice that you are announced as
a candidate for the general elections. We are for-
warding literature in respect to the Scripture Cam-
paign Council and its objects, from which .you will
see we are definitely organising in favor of a Refer-
endum Bill on this question, which provides for the
majority having the right to rule itself on this
matter of securing in Victoria what works so well
in four adjoining Australian States. We shall be
glad to be informed as to your views on this ques-
tion, to guide our friends throughout your electorate.
The widely-advertised educational policy of
the Labor party of Victoria is that educa-
tion—primary, secondary, technical and uni-
versity—shall be free and secular. Yet the
Scripture Instruction crowd does not scruple
to ask a pledged Labor candidate to sell his
honor for the support of the sectarians. And
it is on this rotten foundation that the advo-
cates of Scripture teaching in State schools
are attempting to build up the characters of
little Willie and Jane Australia!
News items within the past few days:—
The Adelaide S.S. Co. announces that three new
8000-ton vessels have been ordered in Great Britain.
The co. is expecting another new vessel in three
months.
The Howard Smith Co. has notified that it has
ordered a new steamer of 8000 tons. It is rumored
that the co. is about to order two or three additional
cargo steamers.
The Melb. S.S. Co. received by this week’s mail
the description of a vessel of 5000 tons register.
The U.S.S. Co. has purchased a large vessel in
European waters. Other steamers are building, or
in contemplation.
Capital is apparently making frantic pre-
parations to fulfil its threat to flee the
country, and is buying swift vessels to
leave in.
“8.J.H.0.” : Even the very mild compul-
sory military training business is proving a
blessing in several directions. Since a num-
ber of boys have had a taste of the real
thing they have wearied of the Boy Lout
foolishness. At Geelong, recently, the local
Skites disbanded, and it was announced
that the Barnum Powell show had been
killed by the advent of the real article.
N. S. Wales is finding out that, though
J. Bull Cohen loved us as his child, he bit
pieces out of us as though we were his
lamb. For every £lOO the State borrowed
from him between 1905 and 1910 his
charges ran from £3 4s. 3d. to £3 14s. lOd.;
and the State didn’t know what a ravenous
appetite that showed until last year it found
out that the entire cost of raising money in
Sydney was only 2s. lfd. per cent. Thus,
dear, kind Cohen of the J. Bull variety had
been charging his child as much to raise
£lOO as the child finds it can itself raise
£3600 for.
Tommy Bent's best-remembered public
utterance was dug up and artistically em-
ployed in the Tasmanian Legislature, the
other day, by the tremendous Joshua Thomas
Hoskins Whitsitt. He is reported to have
said that the Australian Labor Ministry is
“not fit to carry offal to a bear.” Which,
when you come to think of it, is true, and
the same might be said of Rembrandt,
George Washington, Garibaldi and the
Apostle Paul. But why carry offal to bears
in this large general way, seeing that most
of the tribe prefer fruit and vegetables?
Why not carry the offal to Whitsitt, seeing
that he raised the subject? Then if he didn’t
happen to require any more offal just then
he could pass it on to the bear, provided
that beast didn’t flee with its hair standing
on end when it saw him coming. And if the
bear did retreat in disorder AVhitsitt would
at least have the society of the offal to keep
him from feeling lonesome, and the offal
would have the society of Whitsitt, and the
Labor Government would be satisfied, and
the bear would probably be satisfied, and it
is difficult to see that anybody would have
just cause of complaint.
“The merchants of Sydney are all in a
state of bankruptcy,” wrote Henry Parkes
in a letter to his sister dated September 15,
1841 —just 70 years ago. Things have
changed since then. In the same
letter he tells that a young woman,
who had just arrived in an emi-
grant ship, was ordered “to sit for
one hour in the stocks!” because
she had no home to go to, and was
found on Queen’s Wharf by a
policeman. That was how the olden
Tory crowd encouraged immigra-
tion.
Most Melbourne people have only just dis-
covered that the little suburban Brighton
Gas Co. charges Is. less for cooking-gas and
something less for lighting-gas than the huge
Melbourne octopus squeezes out of the
metropolis. The fact is the best of evidence
that the Melbourne City Council’s electric-
lighting business is not doing the work it
was intended to do —or, anyhow, ought to do.
The Hobart Gas Co. neatly forestalled elec-
tric competition by establishing a make-
believe electric service of its own; and the
fat and sleepy Melbourne City Council is
playing into the hands of the Melbourne Gas
Co. just as effectively as if the electric-light
department were also a branch of the Gas
Co.’s business.
Tlie distinguishing characteristics of “Lib-
eralism” are the grand old British freedom
of thought and action which it allows its
adherents, and its quiet, strong, law-abiding
spirit. Oh, certainly! F’rinstance, accord-
ing to S. M. Herald (23/9/T1) :
The Liberal League at Stuart Town (which is
situated in the Robertson electorate, for which Mr.
Willis was defeated at the last election) passed the
following resolution at last meeting:—
“The Liberal League at Stuart Town is greatly
surprised at Mr. Willis’s action in accepting the
Speakership. He was always treated like a gentle-
man when member for this electorate. If he dares
to show his face in Stuart Town he shall be hanged
like a dog.”
The Liberal feature of the above is that
Willis is to be merely hanged—not boiled.
MORE BRILLIANT DIPLOMACY.
After such another degrading spectacle, it is to
be hoped the country will at last realise the impos-
sibility of Government by Labor. —The Voice of
Liberalism., quite seriously.
THE MAN OF MUDDY METHODS (frantically):
" There!... Now you can see for yourself
what a downright, disgraceful state you r
House is in while in cha7-ge of a Labor
housekeeper !”
The S. M. Herald (18/9/T1) thought it
had discovered a curiosity:—
It is curious that the present (N.S.W.) Government,
which, while in Opposition, clamantly preached the
doctrine of non-borrowing, should thus early in its
career have discovered that one of its main planks
was unworkable, and discredited.
As usual, the Herald hasn’t quite got the
hang of it. The Labor party never tried its
own plank to see whether it was workable
or not. And even the S. M. Herald ought
to know that a ship isn’.t necessarily un-
seaworthy because it hasn’t yet made a
voyage.
That eminent alligator-sitter, Johnson, of
N.S.W., nearly swallowed himself in his
anger, the other night, in the House of
Reps, when Webster is alleged to have said
that “the ex-Premier of N.S.W. was paid a
sum annually for bolstering up the Em-
ployers’ Federation.” Bellowed Johnson:
“There is nothing more despicable than for
a member to make a personal attack on a
person outside.” “Are you referring to Mr.
Waddell’s attack on Judge Higgins?” asked
Page, sweetly. Then Johnson sat down and
glared at Page till his eye got tired.
GRIFFITH,
Minister
for
Works
(N.S.W.)
S. M. Herald (23/9/11) begins to grope
after the light:—
The existing N.S.W. House threatens the whole
value of Parliament to the community. It should
be ended. The first two sessions of this Parliament
are an almost conclusive argument for unification.
A Legislature that can do no better than ours with
the concerns of the State had better be exchanged
for Federal control.
The latest trouble in the United Kingdom
is the strike of Irish railway men. Why
thev should go on strike passes comprehen-
sion. The wages work out at an average of
19s. Bfd. per week, and after making allow-
ance for the better-paid men—engine-
drivers, station-masters and the like—there
must still be 10s. or 12s. a week for the rank
and file. And when a man is wallowing in
the affluence of 10s. or 12s. a week what
more does he want?
BOOTS AND BREAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
These people are continually being tempted to
spend all their spare intellectual energy upon “the
raucous orators of the market-place,” and upon the
one-sided publications of the Labor-Socialist move-
ment. Both orators and publications appeal to
bitter class-hatred, and offer mere materialistic
gains as the supreme end of man’s existence. — Mel-
bourne Argus.
When we arise upon the stump to preach our gospel
of good times,
Stout screams a silly tale of slump, and slates us
for our nameless crimes;
When we appeal to Stout to help his helpless sick,
his broken poor,
We hear a sudden, painful yelp of trouble coming
swift and sure —
A prophecy of blight and rot, and Johnny-get-your-
gun...
What sort of slump is that, if not a gross, material-
istic one?
In these materialistic days the future seems unusual
bright,
When Labor tries, in various ways, to treat himself
(and brother) right,
When Labor strives for bread and cheese, for bright-
red, juicy, butcher’s meat,
For sound, assorted groceries, and chairs, and bed-
steads. Life is sweet
When shines the kindly sun; when each of us is
fairly clothed and fed,
And Labor doth not cease, to preach its gospel of
good boots and bread.
Good boots and tucker fail to touch the right, the
most uplifting spot?
They are the primal cause of much that makes the
toiler’s rotten lot?
It may be so, indeed —and then it may be other-
wise, of course;
It may be bad for people when the plans of Labor
they endorse; •
But still it’s joy, when Fatness bawls his silly
bawls of blast and wreck,
To see how Labor manna falls and smites him rudely
in the neck!
VICTORIA.

NURSE URE SAYS YOU CAN’T BEAT IT.
In a recent letter from the Lake View Hotel,
Ballarat, Vic., Nurse Ure writes: “You can’t beat
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy for children. It is
absolutely the best I have used in my professional
career, extending over 20 years. Numerous cases of
croup, which is a most dreadful complaint for
children, have come under my notice, and I never
hesitate to recommend Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy,
for it means absolutely the end of the disease after
three or four doses.”*
Kidney Disease
And all allied complaints have their prompt and
effectual remedy in Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, which
act in a wonderfully speedy manner. Give them a
trial. Price, Is. 6d. and 2s. 6d.*
REGULARITY OF THE BOWELS.
THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENCE
AGAINST ILL-HEALTH.
When the bowels are clogged the waste
matter decays and ferments and enters the
Blood, and is carried to all parts of the
body, producing Headaches, Biliousness,
Sleeplessness, Heartburn, Loss of Appetite.
Indigestion, Neuralgia, Rheumatism, and
various other ailments disturbing the Heart
and Nervous System; and if continued is
liable to cause inflammation of the Bowels,
Liver and Kidneys.
To maintain a healthy system the bowels
should operate at least once every 24 hours.
This is one of Nature’s wise provisions which
is too often ignored, and the result is untold
suffering. Women and children are the great-
est offenders, but why such should be the
case is a problem to be solved. .
“I was a sufferer from Constipation and
Biliousness for some time,” writes Mr. John
H. Jones, of Gobolion Street, Wellington,
N.S.W., “and seeing Dr. Morse's Indian
Root Pills advertised as an effective remedy
for the relief of constipation, I decided to
give your pills a trial, and can say they ha\e
proved very effective indeed. I always keep
them in my home, and consequently recom-
mend them, as aforesaid. ? You have my con-
sent to use this testimony.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Athletic Carnival, at Sydney Sports
Ground last Saturday was the biggest affair of its
kind held in Sydney for more years than one cares
to remember. It was run under the auspices of the
N.S.AV. Rugby League. Over 6000 people paid for
admission —a phenomenal attendance for an athletic
gathering in the Ma metropolis. The meeting
sported two great attractions —the meeting between
the Australian flier Donaldson and Yankee Holway,
which attracted the real sports, and the appearance
of some 16 ladies in a magnificent leg-show, which
drew the other sort. The run between Holway and
Donaldson was an intensely interesting affair. On
July 8 this year, Holway ran away from Arthur
Postle and A. A. Taylor over 130yds. at Sydney
Agricultural Ground, in, according to the clock,
12 7-10 sec. Donaldson had broken down in training,
and could not take part, and he objected to Holway
grabbing any title till he had met him, Donaldson,
and defeated him. The dispute raged long and
loud ; but on Saturday it was dragged to an end by
Donaldson streaking over the course (130yds. 4in.)
in 12sec. If this was correct it is a world’s record,
the previous best being that of W. Johnson, of Eng-
land, who covered the distance in 12 l-Bsec. The
Australian demonstrated how easy it was for long
legs and a frame to outpace the cart-horse-
built variety of ped. A good start saw the Yankee
bound away, and for 30yds. there was little between
them; then the long striding Donaldson began to
come along with a 500-motor-h.p. pace, and, racing
away from Holway at 70yds., ran straight as an
arrow, and won by some 15ft. The crowd howled
with delight. It was a good tussle for half the
journey, but thereafter the Australian never looked
anything but an easy winner. The three timekeepers
agreed that Donaldson had flown over the distance
in 12sec.-—equal to 10yds. under evens.
Of the 16 acceptors for the ladies’ champion-
ship, three failed to don the running kirtle or
knickers, and the remaining 13 received a wild
ovation from the crowd. But the race was a com-
paratively tame affair, for the result was never in
doubt. Miss Moore, who recently gathered in the
amateur championship, easily packed the “ £ 5 open
order” in her peggy-bag, with Miss Meredith as
runner-up. Among the starters were seven with the
prefix “Mrs.,” and their “form” tended to the belief
that they had left their best efforts at home while
careering after the children.
Talking about running, A. B. Postle made
things hum at Pittsworth (Q.) last week, when,
after gathering in the 7 syds. Sheffield Handicap
from the 2yds. mark, in 7 l-ssec., he demoralised
the 70yds. record. Three timekeepers agreed that
the distance was stamped over in 7sec., which is a
mighty fine sprint.
Saturday’s Victorian League football final
was an episode of disappointment and a tragedy of
lost opportunity. Given a fine day, and Essendon
and ’AVood at the top of their form, and there should
have been an exhibition of fast, sparkling football.
But light showers throughout the first half made
ball and ground greasy, and the anxiety of the
players made their fingers likewise. For half the
game the 43,905 suectators urged the “Magpies” to
“play their game,” but the scrambling continued.
Essendon was little better, except that it could mark
a bit, yet its lead at the interval should have been
30 points instead of 16. The last half was ’AVood’s.
By sheer persistency it pulled up to within one
point of ’Don. Then the latter made a last dash, and
scored two goals. The game seemed over, as there
were but five more minutes to play, and the crowd
began to stream out. But ’AVood wasn’t yet finished.
AVithin a minute it had passed the ball down
between the posts. It repeated the manoeuvre,
but only a behind resulted, and the hands were
marking the hour. Then,' right on time, a ’AVood
forward marked within easy distance, and carefully
“placed” the ball. A goal meant a draw and an-
other chance. But the kick went wide, and the bell
rang out the premiership of ’Don, which won by five
goals 11 behinds to four goals and 11 behinds. It
was a sloppy, untidy, but withal, courteous game,
ruined by anxiety and lack of confidence. ’Don won
by better marking and surer handling.
Essendon, Victoria’s new premier club, hadn’t
arrived at the top since 1901, when the same Colling-
wood was second; but from 1891 till ’94, it held
the fort against all-comers, and ran through one
whole season unbeaten. This year’s triumph is a
feather in the cap of that champion coach, Johnny
AVorrail, who had a good team to work on, and kept
it well strung to the finish. The “gates” of this
year’s three “big” matches were £1624, £1398,
and £1584, a total of £4606, nearly £5OO above
last year’s takings for the four “finals.” Against
this sum the Association, for its four games, raked
in £1435, which is a decisive answer to those who
claim that Ass. ball is better worth watching than
the League variety. Also, the gentry who claim that
the “gate” is everything, may note that had Essen-
don lost on Saturday, it still had an even chance,
and the League should have been £l5OO or so better
off. Yet Essendon didn’t lose.
The Ass. Essendon —the real Essendon,
for the League club of that name doesn’t belong to
that suburb at all —was simultaneously deciding its
challenge final against Brunswick, which had beaten
it by a pair of points the week before. Like Colling-
wood in the League, Essendon took the risk of play-
ing a damaged man, though, as he kicked two goals,
he couldn’t have been quite dead. As in the League,
the cooler and more seasoned team made better use of
what few chances it got, and won—-Essendon, four
goals 10 behinds to ’AVick’s three goals eight b-'-
hinds. The play was mannerly, but lacked the pre-
cision of games that counted for much less. This is
Essendon’s first Ass. premiership, though it has been
third the last two seasons, and its arrival is chiefly
due to the play and energetic leadership of one man,
whom St. Kilda, of the League, fired out last season.
AVe will now, dearly beloved, adjourn to the
cricket pitch, where the “flannelled fool” awaits us,
and the seaside, where the shark loafs easily around,
watching for a nice plump leg for breakfast.

Soccer is the only branch of , football
which hasn’t been stowed away in Sydney. Gran-
ville’s defeat of Sydney, on Saturday, by four goals
to one, makes a final match with Balmain necessary
to determine the holders of the Rawson Cup—that, is,
if the protest bv Granville against another club is
upheld by the Association.
N.S.W. Rugbv League put up its shutters
and retired for its summer sleep heavier in the
pocket than ever. In fact, the pocket bulged so
much that the League, feeling good, handed the
£9OO taken at the “double final” gates to charity,
and thereby earned considerable blessing and credit.
The fearsome expansion of the League brand of
lioof-ball is crowding the opposition so badly that
next season’s struggle for playing grounds has begun
already, and the underground engineers are in con-
stant work.
The old Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) club sup-
plied the harvest, for the bookmakers on Saturday,
and gave the prads a final non-committal gallop be-
fore the big Spring meeting. The Hawkesbury
Guineas comprised the big event, and, though only
five three-year-olds were saddled up for the £250
prize, the race was well contested, and Pontano won
with but a head to spare from Popinjay and Alured.
The Hawkesbury Spring Handicap—which was a prize
valued in davs a-rear —went to Britain, with Sand-
bath and Flaxen ahead of six others. Three of the
winners of the day—Lager, Borambil and Britain
are in the Epsom Handicap on the coming Saturday,
and their form makes the tangle worse from the
punters’ viewpoint. The bookmakers had a profit-
able afternoon, as only one winner was weighed
down with "old to the position of favorite.
If the Epsom falls to a Victorian candi-
date, the animal will probably be Broadsword. The
son of Clanranald is understood to be going for all
he’s worth, and he’s worth a whole crowd of ordinary
horses when in a good humor. Broadsword can
carry the weight (9st. 41b.), anyhow; 101 b. more
than he carried in the Doncaster iast April will not
make him go faster, but it will not stop him, and,
in the meantime, he has probably improved. Lady
Medallist looks a better chance on their Maoriland
form, but Broadsword is judged more on his pro-
gressive racing since he settled in Australia.
* * * *
These recent failures of Blairgour would
suggest that the somewhat in-bred son of Wallace
and Wakeful cannot go a mile if he were not already
credited with an easy win over a longer course. A
year ago Blairgour, starting a hot favorite, got away
with the Memsie Stakes at Caulfield, which is a
nine-furlongs event. It was not a big performance,
but it made his subsequent collapse in the Caulfield
Guineas look all wrong. Again in the autumn, the
animal stopped unaccountably in the Newmarket,
after his end-to-end victory in the Futurity Stakes
(seven furlongs) had paralysed the betting market.
His two notable failures last season, when he was
apparently “fit,” contrasted with his three notable
successes, left the question of Blairgour’s stamina
open to doubt. His “form” this season, thusfar,
leaves it just where it was. Just the sort of queer
customer to score a surprise in a 12-furlongs race.
The return to the old order of things with
the Sydney and Melbourne racing fixtures this spring,
will revive the old possibilities of Randwick “form”
being indorsed at Caulfield and re-indorsed at Flem-
ington—if it hasn’t gone stale between the end of
September and the beginning of November. Last
year the Randwick meeting overlapped the opening
day at Caulfield, and the three nlaced ones in Caul-
field Cup, run on October 15, had all been wanted
for the Metropolitan 12 days previously. Two of
them —Apple Pie and Britain —had been rushed over
to Melbourne after runninsr at Randwick only a week
before. This year the Metropolitan is dated October
2, and the Caulfield Cup comes on October 21, or 19
days later. There was the same interval between the
two handicaps when Poseidon ran second for the one
and captured the other. The brilliant three-year-old
maintained his “form” from the Sydney Tatt.’s
meeting, on September 8, to the Melbourne Cup, on
November 6, but a Poseidon, like a Carbine, happens
only occasionally. As a rule, the nags ripe enough
for big performances at Randwick are going stale
before the close of Melbourne Cup meeting. Flav-
inius, last year, was a case in point, and punters
should note the fact that three-year-olds, anyhow,
are likely to remain in “nick” longer than old
horses.
Grafnax (Grafton-Xantippe), Australia’s
champion steeplechaser, winner of over £3500 in
stakes alone, jumped into eternity last Thursday
without hitting the top rail. In the Australian
Steeplechase, last mouth, he came to grief at a
hurdle, and fractured one of his stifles. Necrosis,
and then enteritis, set in, and vet. AY. J. Miller
could do nothing. The prad’s first victory was as a
five-year-old, when he won the Eumolo Cup (flat
racing) at Cootamundra (N.S.AY.). Then he was
entered for hurdles, and won a jumpers’ flat race at
Rosehill in 1908, and the Maiden Steeplechase at
the 1909 Grand National meeting. In 1910 he ran
first in both A.J.C. steeples, and in the Vie. G.N.
Steeple the same year, with list. 121 b. up. Last
season he won the Australian Steeplechase at Caul-
field, with 12st. 121 b. up, and did it in 7min. 54fsec.,
but at the G.N. meeting at Flemington he only ran
third. He started favorite in the Australian Steeple
last month with 13st. 21b. in the saddle, and fell
with the above-mentioned fatal results. He was
owned by J. P. Cox, of Mora station, and trained
by McGrath, of Kensington.
On South Aus. racecourses the innovation
of an eighth event is creeping in. For some time
past seven races have been more usual than six. The
many racegoers who don’t profess to know the points
of a horse and don’t go near the saddling-paddock,
find three-quarters of an hour between events too
long a time to wait. The club doesn’t mind giving
an extra £l5O stake, because, if £2OOO more goes
through the totalisator over it, the club’s 74 per
cent, commission pays the stake. And, as owners
can see their weights for a sovereign, and accept
for another, they like it too. It is the totalisator
that does it all.
Bookie Sol Green has but small respect for
brother Galilees, and in the past two weeks is
alleged to have supported Comedy King to win a
small fortune in the Melbourne Cup. The imported
prad now rules at a short price. The move has
brought about a scare in the illicit short-price places
where the gambling law is side-stepped; and as
Green is credited with putting the commission
simultaneously in the othpr States, the yelling of
Irish Moses spreads throughout Australia. It may
be rough from a bookmaking point of view, but it
is excellent sport.
Of the 127 acceptors in t&e Goulburn-to-
Sydney Dunlop cycle race, exactly 100 faced the
starter ; no less than three of the scratch men failed
to put in an appearance. Of the actual starters
from scratch two were from Victoria, one from
AVestralia, and two from Maoriland. The Ma State
hadn’t a single representative on the line of difficulty.
Of the five one was placed, D. Kirkham, of Victoria,
being second. A. Pianta. of AVestralia, came 20th.
The actual winner was AV. Rennie, of Victoria —that
State supplying the first three men home. Kirk-
ham, who ran second, put up the fastest time over
the difficult 131-mile course, and created a new
record (6hr. 19min. 31sec.). The previous best
was Tom Larcombe’s 6hr. 35min. The Dunlop Co.
is justly proud of the fact that the six first men
home were mounted on its tyres. The roads seem
to have been fairly good throughout, any rain that
had fallen merelv serving to lay the dust. Falls and
punctures, though numerous, were not severe. About
the worst damage done was when Honevman, of
Sydney, broke his handle bar, but he patched it up
somehow and ran into fifth place. It was a good
race, but the result does not indicate that the Ma
State has any great hope of winning, the great AVarr-
nambool. That looks like a certainty for A’ictoria
this 3 r ear.
* * * *
Last tveek was a time of record annihila-
tion. On Saturday, sprinter Jack Donaldson put up
a world’s best by fleeing on foot over 130yds. in
12sec., at Sydney; and cyclist Kirkham clipped
15min. 57sec. off the previous best effort for the
131-mile stretch between Goulburn and Ashfield. On
Friday, A. B. Postle careered over 70yds. in 7sec.,
at Pittswortli (0.), and put a new world’s record
on the slate; while at Adelaide (S.A.), on the same
day, a misguided weight-lifter hoisted 2371 b. above
his head in a clean hoist, and thereby made short-
weiffht of all previous efforts for a 10-stone person.
Australia, therefore, supplied something for the
balance of the world to worry about.
That: there is still good rowing material in
N. S. Wales, was demonstrated on the Parramatta
by a couple of raw youths last Saturday, at the
regatta of the Kemp Professional Club. One very
dangerous-looking infant, named George Jack, a 16-
ycar-old, who weighs 13st., led the back markers
right up to the line, and was only beaten on the
post. This, after less than two months’ experience
in a sculling boat, and notwithstanding that he
stopped several times, and had some narrow escapes
from a capsize. He is a most promising water-pup,
and gives promise of being an even greater Dick
Arnst. The other infant phenomenon is J. Lorimer,
who, though not so promising as the other, is prom-
ising enough to go on with.
* * * *
Besides giving the punters a fair deal the
Tote befriends the Government which sanctions it.
Last year Maoriland raked in £49,000 from the Tote
Tax, and there is little doubt that, by sticking to the
bookmakers, N. S. Wales and Victoria are each
throwing away something like £lOO,OOO per annum.
And that heap of money isn’t to be sniffed at even
by such bloated States as N.S.W. and Victoria.
The fact that Grade Cricket will com-
mence in Sydney on Saturday, is an official an-
nouncement that summer is here. The senior clubs
will number 13, and the Second and Third grades
will have 19 each. Which means that every grade
is to be plagued with the infernal nuisance of a
bye - .
Judging by the preliminary roll on the
field the old-time N.S.W. cricket cracks are going to
make a splash this season. Trumper rattled up 112,
not out, in a total of 228 against Marrickville, and
Macartney made 90 of the 152 scored against St.
George. “Mary Ann” distinguished himself with the
ball, and smashed up six Marrickville wickets for 43
runs. There is a dark suspicion that if M.A.N. will
only fall off the high horse on which he perched last
year, he will be a useful man to have about the
premises when Warner’s team is trying to break in
and burgle the “ashes.” #
The N.S.W. Cricket Association has de-
cided that the captain in all big matches shall be
chosen by the selection committee. That committee
consists of Trumper, Bardsley and Hume; so, pre-
sumably, Trumper will not be deposed, in spite of
the complaints as to his lack of genius in choosing
his bowling talent last season. Trumper, with his
judgment sharpened by his season’s experience, isn’t
likely to disgrace the position, but, all the same,
N.S.W. is a cold place for the cricketing colt. He
has to wait a long time for that room which is
always said to exist at the top.
N.S.W. Cricket Association shows sound
common-sense in the engagement of Alec Ban-
nerman as coach.” Alec’s good work contributed
not a little to the N.S.W. success against the
opposing States and Springboks, and, with an Eng-
lish team coming this season, and an Australian
team going to Britain next season, there is more
scope for his efforts than ever.
After all, South Australia isn’t going to
lose left-hand trundler W. J. Whitty, who has been
recuperating in N.S.W. S. Aus. needs the cham-
pion left-hander more than Ma: and the return of
the wanderer will make much difference to the Crow-
Eaters in the representative matches.
Victorian Cricket Association will pre-
sent the takings of the Vic. v. England match, on
February 2 and following days, as a benefit to Jack.
Blackham, Australia’s great wicket-keeper in days
gone by. It is a graceful act. Considering the
iron wall that the wicket-keeper is expected to repre-
sent, no player deserves and requires a benefit more
than that battered individual.
Trade brochures are not usually interest-
ing, but the writer became so engrossed in the
Dunlop Co.’s “All About Cycling” that he
read on till he had left his station 20
miles behind. The pamphlet told how to
fix up almost every trouble that could possibly occur
to a cyclist, but it said nothing about how a man
walking on two sticks was to get back over 20
miles, so there was nothing for it but to pay, money
to Mr. Johnson and take the next train. Anvone
desiring to get back on his enemv should carefully
provide him with a copv of “All About Cycling”
three stations from his destination.
Sam McVea, colored pug, is also a motorist
and a sailor. He spent a good part of his life at
sea, and the last time he was in Australia was with
the sailing ship Melindo. On the trip out in the
Argyllshire he took his turn at the wheel every day,
and steered the boat into Adelaide harbor, and also
through Svdney Heads. He says he is anxious to
meet Johnson, and, “if I don’t beat him in the ring,
I’ll beat him on my motor.” He has two cars, one
a racer, and Lill’ Arthur is bringing out three. The
race has already been arranged, and McVea is going
to enter some events here to get into form. Sam
has also had a trip in an aeroplane, but thinks that
one was enough. .Johnson can have that sort of
flying all to himself. #
Ern Waddy, the Adelaide “hope,” who
knocked out McDonald in seven rounds and Devitt
(who had the experience of 60 fights thick upon him)
in eight, is a bit of a marvel. He bakes bread all
night, and does no training to speak of. For some
reason he is always the unpopular party in a scrap
—the crowds take a sudden and vehement dis-
like to him, and he usually ignores the crowds in
a way that drives them mad. Only once has he talked
back, and that was when McDonald was hammering
awav at him. Then he did the Johnson act: “All
right, you blankers.” he said; “I’ll show you
what I can do with him !” And he did, to such a
degree that an expert at the back of the three bob
seats said, “My Gard, Mack’ll be over here soon.”
Curiously enough, as far back as July
and the early weeks of August, the Yankee sporting
press prophesied that there would be a.n outcry
against this Johnson-Wells fight in England. The
Yankee papers, however, calculated that it would
be from the fight followers and not from the Metho-
dists, on the ground that the fight was a one-sided
affair, in which a white man was being pitted against
a black with whom he had no chance. The yell
from the pious clan was unexpected. As a matter of
fact, the Mclnstoush was offered control of the scrap
somewhere about the end of June, and turned it
down in his own inimitable style. All the world of
London wondered —but the Magnificent knew when
to come in out of the wet. As a matter of fact, it
is rather unfortunate that the Bombardier has been
pitted against the Golden-Mouthed One. For the
Bombardier is coming on very well, and on appear-
ances onlv requires to smash round among men of
his own class a bit more to blossom out into a real
success. Pitting him against Johnson at this stage
is nipping him in the bud, and the sports it.
Sam Austin, one of the authorities on the
“game” in the great and glorious “Yewnited Stites,”
admits to a profound belief in one Tony Ross. Tony
is an Italian, who distinguished himself by putting
up a whirlwind fight against the big black. Joe
Jeannette, who probably stands third on the list of
heavyweights, the gentlemen above him being John-
son himself and Langford. At long-range fighting
Tonv was outpointed bv the veteran, but in the in-
roughing he gave his duskv conqueror a lively time.
He has a tremendous capacity for punishment, and
regarded as thistledown blows that would have sent
to sleep most of the prominent occupants of _ the
square circle. Langford, who outpointed him in a
six-round go, declared him the toughest morsel he
had tried to chew. Jeannette, after the scrap, said
Ross had hurt him a good deal, and had shown that,
with a little more experience, he would have “chawed
me right up.” Jeannette had his bruises thick
upon him when he made that admission, and next
day promptly denied a lot of things, but it seems
that while his bashes were fresh he spoke with an
open soul. But even afterwards he admitted that
he landed a number of blows which he considered
the knock-out kind, and found them of no value.
Yet, somehow, this writer has no great faith in a
bruiser whose stock-in-trade is inability to feel. It’s
ability to make the other cove feel that really counts
in bruising.
The pug is evidently no mug—in Eng-
land, anyhow ; and the agitation against the .Johnson-
Wells fight revealed the fact that pugs have a trades
union of their own. The union protests against the
agitation, and in doing so hits the parsonical crowd
fair on the midriff, with a claim that professional
boxing develops the moral qualities in a way that
study for a course of divinity does not. The boxer,
to be successful, has to live wholesomely, for if he
does not eschew vices, some more moral pug chews
him right up the first time he shows his nose inside
a ring. All the same, the discovery that the bruisers
have a union is liable to cause the audience to hold
its tongue in its che_k while it watches the gory
scrap. Nobody will really believe that two trades
unionists will do their best to kill each other for the
amusement of a mostly blacklev crowd.
* * * *
Followers of the noble art of woodening
one’s fellow-man for gold and the odd change who
missed the scrap between Australia’s lightweight
champion, Hughie Mehegan, and the Yanko-Italio
boxer, Frank Picato, on Saturday night, missed the
cleanest, fairest and one of the fastest exhibitions
yet staged in the big Mclnstadium in Sydney. It is
a good job that the Shakers and Dry Baptists weren’t
there, or their howls of protest would have been
closed for the rest of the season, at least, and
Mclntosh would have been minus his best and
cheapest advertising medium. One instance will
serve to show the spirit that animated the boxers
throughout the 20 rounds. In the tenth session
Picato struck his opponent low; of course, without
intention. Mehegan lowered his arms, bent up with
pain, and Picato likewise stopped, no doubt ex-
pecting an appeal for a foul. After a moment’s rest,
however, the Australian straightened up. “Box on,”
was all he said, and whirled his weapons. Picato,
equally sportsmanlike, put up his hands, but did no
more than defend himself until his opponent had re-
covered from the unfortunate blow. Picato surprised
the majority of those who were present with the
clever showing he made against Mehegan. It is true
that he was about 101 b. heavier than the latter, but
just prior to the fight it was known that he was not
in such splendid health. The Australian was fit to
fight for the ransom of a rich uncle; his blows were
timed with extra precision, and his smother was
almost as protective as a rabbit-proof fence. Never-
theless, he seems to be developing a tendency to
overdo the smother tactics, and on Saturday received
some whangs on the forehead that, coming from a
man with more mule power in his upper hoof, would
have led to possible recriminations at the coroner’s
quarters. Up till the 12th round there was not f a
great deal to choose between the men, Mehegan’s
cleverness just keeping him a bit ahead in the
points. The 13th continuation of the shindy wgs
Picato’s, and it seemed then that he had suddenly
developed an unsuspected mine of confidence, and
was going to pay dividends. Mehegan, however,
had been saving himself, and a few rounds later
went in to give his man the rounds of the kitchen,
in order to make sure of victory. The last lap saw
him spring at the enemy like a wild cat with a buU
ant on his conscience, and when the gong exploded
the issue was beyond doubt —Mehegan the winner on
points. All the same, the Italian-Yankee isn’t done
with yet by a considerable distance.
Throughout last week golfers smote and
swore over the Rose Bay (Sydney) links, in deciding
the baubles attending their sidelight of sport. The
Australian championship final fell to J. D. Howden
(Vic.), from C. Felstead (Vic.) —in fact, the John
Weary State supplied the last four to lend a hand
in the struggle. But N.S.W. golfers reversed mat-
ters in the inter-State matches, wherein Victoria was
annihilated by six matches to one, and the monopoly
which has existed for six years thereby checked. The
ladies also held up Ma’s mantelpiece, narrowly win-
ning their dustup by two holes in a match.
The announcement that a 14-year-old
girl swung clubs in Muswellbrook (N.S.W.) School
of Arts from 10 a.m. till midnight is worthy of
notice —much notice of a hostile nature. First, some
intelligent medical man should put his professional
reticence aside, and sound that girl’s heart, and tell
the misguided parents the exact truth. The chances
are she will grow up—if she lives —-a querulous,
weak, useless woman. Then McGowen’s Government
should hastily pass an Act dealing out six months’
hard “jug” to anyone who aids or abets such exhi-
bitions, for if these long-endurance swings _ become
popular among children, the results will be disastrous
and numerous. This child’s exhibition, may have
been perfectly legal, but it was a crime against
Nature, all the same. And Nature always exacts a
penalty without the option. There is no option in
that court.

Died, last week, John A. Barry, writer of
many sea yarns, though his best-known
“Steve Brown’s Bunyip” was pitched on
shore. After 12 years’ seafaring he retired
with a mate’s certificate, and went to the
Palmer diggings, in North Queensland ; then
he had some years of droving, digging and
boundary riding, and some more years on the
coasters, until finally, about ’96, he settled
down on the staff of the Sydney Evening
News.
Only a short while back the “Liberal”
lady went from door to door, stampeding
the women voters into voting Anti-Sosh,
with terrible descriptions of how tyrannical
unions robbed the working man, and of course
his “poor” wife and children. But the
boom in unionism has brought thousands of
men and women within the scope of various
awards; and now. when the “Liberal” lady
gets on to the union curse, she is hit with
something like this: “Well, before Tom
joined the union he only got 365. a week,
and now he gets 455.” ; or there’s a cold re-
mark that the union raised Johnny’s wages
55., and Kitty’s wages 7s. It is a clever
canvasser that can hold out against the hard,
tough facts concerning Johnny’s extra five
shillings and Kitty’s seven.

It is, in fact, “starvation,” for
starving means lack of food, and
food is not food until it is digested.

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficiently stamped.
Name and address must appear on MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted, whether sent by post or handed
in; and no MS. will be returned unless stamps
(of any State) accompany.
C. Newlings: (1) The Bulletin’s ligures
did represent British exports and imports, and when
you say they are exports only, you are simply absurd.
(2) The Bulletin pointed, on the authority of the
English Statesman’s Year Book, to a decline in the
digging out of iron ore, in blast furnaces, pig-iron,
coal, cottons, woollens, linens, shipping in actual
service, shipbuilding, railway revenue, etc. Your
remarks about an increase in the one item of motor-
cars has no bearing on these general figures. (3)
The gross value of manufactures in Australia in 1909
was £107,409,733, and the gross value of all other
industries about £134,000,000, so your figures are
miles out. You make up your case by comparing
the net output of factories with the gross output of
other industries. (4) The manufacturer pays better
wages for short hours than the farmer does for long
ones. He is compelled to do it by Wages Boards
and Arbitration Courts, while the farmer is allowed
to sweat without limit, on the ground that his in-
dustry can’t afford to pay decent wages. If he isn't
protected much lie makes it up in cheap labor. And,
in addition, the N.S.W. railways (which work on
the same basis as other Australian railways) give
him gorgeous assistance. Mis produce is carried at
an average of one-third of Id. per ton per mile,
while manufactured goods pay from Id. to 4id. (5)
Considering the irenzy with which you describe ail
manufacturers as “trusts ’ and “combines" and
“monopolists,” you had better go naked and eat
your food raw and sleep out. What do you mean
by patronising these “trusts" and “combines” and
“monopolists”? (6) Your statement that every pro
tected European country is in revolt is bunkum.
There is one big row in Spain and another in Eng-
land, and some few strikes elsewhere. (7) This
paper never said that Britain hadn’t the biggest
Empire on earth. By the way, that Empire is mostly
Protectionist. (8) Britain hasn’t “practically
a monopoly of the trade of her Dominions.” She
hasn’t quite half of it. (9) Britain is in most years
the world’s greatest shipbuilder, though, in 1908, the
United States is said to have been a fraction ahead
for once. (10) Britain, great as she is, doesn’t own
“more than half” the world’s shipping. (11) The
other discrepancies would take too much space
L.L.: (1) Your suggestion for making estates
unlimited in size, but requiring the owner to em-
ploy a certain amount of labor, would only cause the
big landlord (if he didn’t really need so much labor)
to give nominal employment, at 6d. a week and
sleeping accommodation, to old-age pensioners. (2)
The idea that no “machine” should be sold at over
100 per cent, on the cost of production is all right or
all wrong, according to what you mean by it. It is
quite possible to spend £lOOO or £lO,OOO on experi-
ments before the machine gets bn the market; then
to spend £lO,OOO on appliances for the manufacture
of the machine ; and then, inside a year, to find the
whole thing turned into a bad debt because some-
body else evolves a better machine out of the original
idea. The actual inventor of the machine, if it is a
good machine, generally deserves 100 or 200 per cent.
The middleman who exploits the inventor seldom de-
serves 10 per cent Alec. L.: Verses just missed

A SMART CAPTURE.
The Woman woke with a start
There was someone in the room
And listened for a minute
All was silent as the Tomb
But when she rose from her Bed
To press the alarm
A hand grinped her throat
And another her Arm
She was strangled in silence
And the Murderer bold
Lit his lantern and searched
Round the room for Gold.
But a smart detective
Saw the flickering light
And captured the Villain
Who did the Deed that night.

THE BRIDE’S GOOD-BYE.
The bride has "one from her native home
Full many a mile away;
She has flown from her birthplace far to roam
Never again to stay.
The echoing peals of her youthful voice
And the merry, merry laugh
Shall cease the old heart to rejoice
And I write the epitaph.
’Tis an epitaph but the tomb is vast ;
’Tis the home of her childhood’s days
And the scenes shall cling and bring up the past
Bringing back all the old time ways. /
The bare old arms of the settler gums
(No longer rejoicing in life)
Stand quaint and still like a forest of tombs
These all make the parting loath.
You rollicking soul! Back to your undertakery!
Pariah: A cloudy sunrise J.L.E.: “The
Coward” is merely an old story in outline. .. .El-
maddi: Pleasant little jingle, but there is not
enough in it. You may persist Highlands:
You hunt industriously for your rhymes, but it is
too long and clumsy, and your meaning is not as
plain as a first-class light in clear weather... Dri ft:

‘MUSICAL OPINION & MUSIC TRADE REVIEW,
LONDON, JULY, 1911,
Says : —
“ A Hamburg trade journalist, who has just returned from the
“ Antipodes, states that the pianos manufactured by the Beale Company
“ in Sydney greatly resemble in touch and in tone those turned out at the
“best German factories. The Beale is sold at forty-five pounds and
“ upwards, and enjoys a good reputation not only in Australia but in India,
“Java, South Sea Islands and other colonial countries with hot climates.
“ The 'Hamburger’ fears that if these British colonials extend their piano

NIGHT BY ITCHING
And Burning. Sore Places on Baby’s
Cheeks, Hips, Spine and in Bend
of Arms and Knees. Could Hardly
Walk. Was 111 for Want of Rest.
Got Cuticura Remedies and Now has
Not the Least Sign of Eczema.
*‘My son when two years old had eczema
very badly. He had great sore places on the
KL
edges of his bones, the
lobe of each ear had a
great split, the sores ex-
tending over the jawbone
on to the cheek, and on
the cheek bones against
the eyes were some more
sores, making him look
ghastly. He had a large
.sore on each hip and all
up his spine, and in the
bend of his arms and knees.
The latter were so bad that
the child could hardly
walk. Whenever the child
scratched himself, some
watery matter would come from the places
like great drops of perspiration He was tor-
tured day and night with the awful burning
and itching sensations. I had tried several
remedies, and then I went to the doctor
but the stuff I had from him made not the
slightest impression. The child was getting
quite ill for the want of proper rest.
“I gave up going to the doctor, as a friend,
a nurse, gave me some Cuticura Ointment to
try and see if it would relieve my boy. I used
it for a week, and by that time the places
were looking decidedly less angry, and were
not nearly so irritable. I got some Cuticura
Ointment and Soap, and persevered with
them. He was in such a state I could not
make a tin of Ointment last ten days. I used
to smear the places over two or three times a
day. The eczema kept coming back, but
as soon as it showed 1 used Cuticura Oint-
ment. The boy is now thirteen, and not the
least sign of eczema.” (Signed) Mrs. A.
Oliver, The Gardens, Egerton House, Eger-
ton, near Ashford, Kent, Eng., May 11, 1910.

“half" will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.
Dr. 5. Allen’s <u.s.a.>
Mexican
Walnut Stain
is offered as a Superior Stain. It contains no lead,
mercury, silver, sulphur, etc., and is equally suit-
able for Ladies’ Hair, or Hair of the Beard or
Moustache. None genuine without the signature
of —Alfred Ardley (Registered in the Patents
Office of the Commonwealth).

The Inky Way.
Sydney Evening News runs a weekly page of
(mostly) London chatter, or blither, as a sort of
counter-blast to Emily Soldene’s effort in the loathly
contemp. The trouble is that the News stuff has a
habit of looking as if it were manufactured on this
side. F’rinstance: —
“Wilted Londoners are stealing silently out of the
great metropolis. The Society doll is tired. Dolly
must rest till next year. Cowes, Scotland, Cairo,
Strathpeffer, Margate, and Switzerland are, opening
their nets for butterflies.”
Cowes . . . Cairo . . . Margate l Just so, the London
inkslinger writes knowingly concerning the “luxuri-
ous colonial homes of Toorak, Kose Bay and Wool-
loomooloo."

G. B. Stronach, late editor of Sydney Sunday
Sun, has gone north to the chair of the Brisbane
Daily Mail. It is said that the Mail has now got
boodle behind it, so, with Brains and Boodle, there
ought to be a good time ahead. Stronach has had a
fair tour along the Inky Way, having come in here
30-odd years ago. He joined the Sydney Even-
ing News, and soon rose to be sub-editor; then
Alfred Bennett made him editor of the Town and
Country. Lured to Westralia in the ’9o’s, he edited
the Perth Morning Herald, but resigned -when he
found that he was not to have a free hand. •• His
judgment proved correct; a few years later the
Herald died. Coming back to Sydney, J. M. San-
ders made him associate-editor of the Sunday Sun;
and when he became editor he lifted the paper to
a great circulation. Incidentally, he is- an M.A. and
Triple Prizeman of Edinburgh—but he never speaks
of little things like that. •
James Rutherford, just deceased, practically started
the Bathurst (N.S.W.) National Advocate. A
sturdy Protectionist was Rutherford, and in the
early days the only Bathurst daily was a Freetrade
sheet, which had - a marked disinclination to give
tariff reform orators a show. So the Advocate was
instituted, and began doing good work forthwith.
When George Reid announced, six years ago, that
the fiscal issue had been drowned, and that the
Federal battle lay between Socialism and Anti-
Socialism, the Advocate flung clods, the size of
cathedrals, at Reid, taking the view that the Sosh
business was a fraud. Rutherford couldn’t see it.
Age having somewhat impaired his intellect, he was
fain to take the stout impostor from E. Sydney
seriously. He stood the anti-Reid fulminations of
the paper for a while, and then resigned his direc-
torship. Later, he severed all connection with the
Advocate, and reviled it in the market place and
elsewhere.

Adelaide Herald, of 12/9/’ll, achieved one of
those misprints which set the sub. wondering whether
or not the comp, did it on purpose. It advertised
that somebody’s mortal remains would be removed
for interment at such a time and place, and asked
“fiends” to accept the intimation!
* * * *
“P.X.”: Some day the Inky Wayfarers of Aus-
tralia will meet at a soda fountain or elsewhere,
and discuss how far a journalistic hot-gospeller is
entitled to go ink-wayfaring for the honor and
glory of the thing. Thus, it has just been announced
that “Hugh Mahon, M.H.R., has accepted the posi-
tion of hon. editor” of a new Westralian Labor
paper —a very praiseworthy thing, probably, from
one point of view, but pretty maddening from the
1 viewpoint of the man who gets his bread and butter
by editing newspapers. He, poor devil, is apt to
regard Mahon as much the same sort of person as
the clerk who helps to lift the Fat man’s wool into a
ship when the Fat man says he can’t afford to pay
the wages that the professional wharf-lumper re-
quires. The Labor people who own, or should own,
these papers, could afford to pay their editors
just as well as the Fat person alluded to. Both of
them suffer from the same disease—a dreadful dis-
inclination to part up.

W. J. Chidley’s Melbourne-published pamphlet,
“The Answer,” in which the author attempted with
astonishing frankness to turn all accepted ideas of
sex-relation upside down, has reached London, and
M.A.P. gives it a special par., headed “A Vile
Book.” The editor says: “It is certainly one of the
most infamously wicked examples of sex-perversion
that has ever been printed. I at once submitted the
book to the National Council of Public Morals, and
I understand that it has been referred to the police.”
THE END OF THE ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Attend, ye eager youths who think
Of going on The Press,
Of winning fame through printers’ ink —
To this, my brief address.
Your hopes are boyish day-dreams,
What though your faith is new ?
The Press exists to slay dreams
Of children such as you.
There’s a drear and dismal corner that you’ll find
upon the track,
And you’ll turn it as a mourner —when you get to be
a hack 1
For there is no turning back,
On the pressman’s treadmill-track;
Ask the linesmen —they will tell you, what it means
to be a hack 1
Your best and brightest craftsmanship
The Press will take and use;
For, once it gets you in its grip,
This thing that men call News,
Of uttermost endeavor
’Twill bleed you, heart and brain,
And call you on for ever
To do it yet again.
Though you be a star reporter, winning cross-heads
big and black,
Day by day' your time grows shorter, till you find
yourself a hack.
With your methods of attack
Ineffectual and slack,
While the cubs you knew are subbing—glad to prac-
tise on the hack!
The cracks that take the gallery
May mock the fate in store;
The roundsman with a scoop may see
No future to deplore;
“Exclusive stuff’’ may brighten
The departmental men —
Yet grim forebodings frighten
The boldest, now and then;
Though they swear upon the Bible they will quit the
inky track,
Ere they’re outed by a libel, each may live to be a
hack.
Yes, it’s better than the sack;
Though the Chief of Staff looks black
When the book is overloaded, it’s a Godsend to the
hack!
The Press is no palladium
To those that labor there;
For rarer is than radium
An editorial chair ;
Their copy they may burnish
With quirk and crank and quip—
But shall their efforts furnish
A leader-writership ?
Therefore I, a pressman, pray you, while you yet
are cubs, turn back,
Ere the paper turn and slay you, or convert you to a
hack —
To a moaning maniac
On the dread diurnal rack;
For the triumph of the system is the tribute of the
hack 1

MR* DONALD McDONALD (the well-known writer)
describes the trip as follows :
the greater part of the journey on the Queensland coast the steamer runs between the
H Great Barrier Reef and the mainland, making it one of the smoothest of the sea trips of Aus-
tralasia. The route is dotted with picturesque islands, covered with foliage strange to
southern eyes, and the boat is ever rounding headlands, streaming into fine bays and estuaries. The
famous Whitsunday Passage, between Mackay and Bowen, is extremely picturesque.”

PIKE BROTHERS Ltd Brisbane.
IN BANANA LAND
“Kuscobin” : The Queensland Government
has set aside the C.D. Act in the metropoli-
tan area, so the good character which the
British Admiralty gave to Brisbane as being
a specially clean and healthy port, and miles
ahead of Sydney in a hygienic sense, will
probably be lost in very short order. It is
commonly reported that this relapse into
dirt and disease was the price paid by the
Government tor the snuffle vote at tile re-
cent by-elections.
Bananaland could improve on its method
of appointing its mining wardens. A young-
ster enters the office as licker, and gradually
ascends till he is Clerk of Petty Sessions.
Then, after some experience in granting
miners’ rights, etc., he goes forth as a full-
fledged warden, and writes the monthly
official report on the mines of his district.
This treatise is supposed to be reliable in-
formation, though, in many cases, it is
merely an account of what the owners say
about their shows, and what they say isn’t
qlways as truthful as it is enthusiastic.
Queensland’s active immigration operations
are enabling J. Bull to dispose of a portion
of his helpless population. Among the con-
tingent which arrived by a recent immigrant
ship were two small idiot children, two crip-
ples, and three boys who were at the least
weak-minded.
Died at Southport, the other day, John
Jardine, whose brothers Frank and Alex-
ander formed the first cattle station in York
Peninsula as far back as 3865. Their father
was Police Magistrate at Rockhampton, and
was appointed to found the settlement of
Somerset at the top end of Bananaland.
The two young men—one was 23 and the
other 20—resolved to establish a cattle-sta-
tion at Cape York, and set out from Rock-
hampton with a party consisting of six
white men and four blackboys. The last
300 miles of the trip had to be done on foot,
and when they got to the end of it, they had
lost nearly all their horses and more than
half of their cattle. The Peninsular blacks
gave them a let of trouble, and on one occa-
sion a pitched battle was fought. Thirty
Binghis were killed, and a good many more
were wounded. Frank and Alexander Jar-
dine are both living. The former is still at
the old Cape York station. The latter didn’t
stay there long, and subsequently joined
the Bananaland Harbors and Rivers Depart-
ment. John (deceased) was on the Cape
York station for some years, but had been
connected with a Brisbane firm lately.
E. M. Macartney, who got in for Too-
wong, the other day, largely on the Serip-
ture-in-State-schools racket, is a chip of the
old holy block. Dean Macartney, of Mel-
bourne, was his grandad, and the Dean, as a
member 6f the Public Library Committee,
moved arid carried, in the ’7o’s of the now
decomposed century, a motion that all “im-
moral” words and phrases in the works of
Shakspeare and other classic scribes should
be pasted over with goldbeater's skin. The
deed was done, too.
Letter received by Labor member Allen
from a friend in Java: —
One workman I saw in a factory recently was not
more than five years old. This mite revelled in the
Carnegie-like wage of twopence a day and free rice.
Tea-packers, mostly gills, make from Id. to 5d., and,
with free rice, live in a.Huence.
When Federal Ministers talk wildly of com-
mencing to sweep away nrotective duties, let
them think of that Javan lilliputian of five,
with his twopence a day—though even that
seems prodigal payment in a country where
the average full-grown and experienced
sugar-estate coolie gets no more than five-
pence.
THE POJEERS OF WOMAN.
BILL (painting): “ Who's kicking up all the row next door?"
DAN (also painting): “Sure, I dunno, ’Tis ayther 40 men or two women."
The Bananalnnd Government recently
avowed its intention of improving the con-
dition of the underpaid branches of the Pub-
lic Service. _ Next week the salary of Rail-
way Commissioner Evans was lifted from
£1750 to £2OOO, and one low-wage employee
had some improvement perpetrated upon
him.
Hugh Miles Milman, Government Resi-
dent at Thursday Island, with control over
Torres Strait and its islands, died at South-
port on Saturday, lie was the son of a
Devonshire baronet, the first of the Milman
barbflets being physician to George 111. The
Queensland sprig was born in 1845, entered
the navy in 1859, and was invalided in 1865.
Coming to Australia, he had some station ex-
perience on Peak Downs, and afterwards as
a. partner in Listowel Downs. He sold out
of that and joined J. R. Jardine. his brother-
in-law, in the purchase of Marlborough.
Drought and disease swamped them, and
Milman got a job as P.M., first at Aramac
and then at Cooktown ; and when old John
Douglas died he was provided with another
billet as Resident at Thursday Island. He
married Katherine Marde, a daughter of
John Jardine —and there was a baronetcy
wandering about in that family, too.

It is disquieting to find that the practice of us'ng
the Prayer for Parliament, appointed in the Prayer
Look, has very largely heen dropped in .our
churches. We criticise Parliament freely, and vve
sometimes abuse it vehemently ; but we do not pray
for it. —Brisbane Church Chronicle.
Oh, let us pray for Parliament, whatever else we
miss,
And lift a kind petition to the Throne of Grace and
Bliss ;
For if we run this island through, from happy shore
to shore,
We cannot find a body here who want our praying
more.
Tile Tor}' crew are heaving lavish curses on the
Rads;
The Rads condemn the Tories as a set of arrant
cads ;
Each party vows the other one has reached the lowest
level,
And each believes the other’s driving matters to the
Devil.
The Land is riven by their strife from Torres to the
Leeuwin,
For each is sure the other’s aim is rapine red and
ruin ;
Each one’s accusing t’other of unscrupulous ambition,
Of trafficking in turmoil and of waltzing to sedition.
Says A.: “You’re only aiming at the spoiling of the
classes.”
Says B.: “You are but grinding down the poor and
lowly masses.”
And then says C. of A. and B. (with much of truth
about them) :
“The Country would get on as well or better far
without them.”
And he who calmly views the game with philosophic
focus,
Must wonder how it is that out of all this hocus-
pocus,
And vulgar bounce and diatribe, and dulness deep
and deadly,
The State can lift its head at all and breathe above
the medley.
So don’t forget to pray for him —the hapless poli-
tician ;
And let his name remembered be as oft as you peti-
tion ; ' -
And if, in spite of all your prayers, the Ileav’ns re-
fuse to aid him.
Remember he is just the man your suffrages have
made him.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, September 23, 1911.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Premieress Denham has been scoring again
for the Popularity Stakes. This time it
was a garden party of the Very Best People,
on Thursday, amidst her beautiful collection
of palms and other vegetables. Those who
were present agree that it was the most
successful entertainment of its kind since
the first lady entertained the serpent to
afternoon fruit in Eden ; those who were not
invited say—well, it doesn’t matter what they
say. Daughters Elsie and Winnie acted as
general managers of the commissariat, and
the star guests were Lady Mac and the
Vision, both garbed in the favorite amethyst.
On the same day the popular Mayoress of
Windsor also conducted a tea scramble for
notables. Scores of them attended and did
the tea proud.
The marriage of Hugh McWhirter Kid-
ston, this week, recalls the fact that he is
the proprietor of several medals from the
Humane Society, gained by diving into the
flooded Fitzroy (Rockhampton) and drag-
ging forth the apparently drowned. He was
a good deal cooler on that occasion than the
other day when he dived into his own pocket
for the gold ring. And he won’t get any
medals for it, either. That sort of thing is
the real heroism that passes unnoticed in
. this world of limelight.
I.ady Macgregor and the Vision lent their
moral support to the Flower Show this after-
noon but the weather’s unfriendly attitude
accounted for a poorly-followed" example.
Thp flowpr'! notable npau nnrl
orchids, were magnificent,’ and the straw-
are r no S tsoldln S sh a o b ns eS th ® ° rder that
aie not som in snops.
No appointment lias yet been made to fill
in the gap caused by the departed Scarlett,
who, this morning, crept aboard the mail
train, and silently stole away. Tennis par-
ties, at Government House, have been many
and often during the week, and tile number
of society girls who have discovered a latent
enthusiasm for the game might surprise the
uninitiated and very unsophisticated. Until
the arrival of another Young Gentleman,
Captain Foxton will act as A.D.C.
The Mayoress having good cause to be
satisfied wjth the result of her “stand and
deliver propaganda for the Sick Children’s
Hospital, handed over a cheque worth about
£l6O to the president of that institution on
Tuesday last. Mrs. Cowlishaw said she was
pleased to get it, and not a living soul
doubted her. After transferring the cheque
the Didaams lady spread the glad tea and
strawberries. But interest in the hos-
pital does not seem to be thriving, and the
progressive element in the committee has a
feeling that it is trying to bore through the
stone wall of indifference with the penknife
of despair.
The Medical Congress has left us with
scarcely a doctor to share amongst us.
Health Commissioner Elkiugton, the Wil-
ton Loves, the Guilford Davidsons, and Dr.
Eleanor Bourne are in your State arguing
the point about germs and other public
nuisances.
The Brisbane Daily Mail is rapidly get-
ting wise to the trials of man. The other
day, in reviewing the many reasons' why the
mysterious death of a young man was not
due to suicide, the family journal stated
that he had no troublesI—not 1 —not even a sweet-
heart !
The boys of the Grammar School enter-
tained delighted mothers at a concert, the
other night, the principal items of which
were scenes from “The Rivals.” They cer-
tainly were wonderfully good, but what was
even better was the volley of advice given
in a free and generous manner by every
small boy in the building as to how Beverley
should make love to the fair Lydia. Mothers
looked startled at the experienced tone of
the remarks.
The Sydney bowlers have returned to
their Sydney wives with “the ashes” locked
away for safe keeping. Years ago our stout
men could beat anything at the game, but
it seems to be getting too strenuous, or they
may be getting too stout, or perhaps they
are dead, and only thin men play nowadays
—anyhow, our triumphs are not what they
were on the green that lies before the club
bar. Still, we’re good losers, which counts
for something.
The Botanic Gardens are becoming in-
creasingly popular, and children’s parties
tnere are the fad of the moment. A few
days ago Mrs. W. H. Moore made a small
grandson’s birthday the excuse to feed about
300 youngsters and a score or so of mothers;
and this afternoon Mrs. Frank Wilson, the
popular little wife of Dr. Wilson, shep-
herded another large flock of lambs. Also,
last week, Clinton, the home of the Deputy-
Governor Morgans, was overrun by a tem-
pestuous herd of children.
The “Gay Gordon” mummers and mum-
meresses took with them to Maoriland one of
our society warblers, to wit Ida Murphy
(daughter of the Hon. Peter), whose voice
has been dug up and sown and generally cul-
tivated by Steffani. Talking of voices, Alioe
Currie made a fine impression this evening.
She won her laurels, I understand, in sunny
Sydney under Mrs. Christian; none the less,
she is a Queenslander, and we like to re-
member the fact.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.

Petrie, M.L.A., got a chance last week to
bring on his motion in favor of “doing some-
thing”-—preferably in the way of a land
grant—for Queensland pioneers of 50 years
or over. But the House reckoned up the
land that the pioneers had already collared,
and decided that it was about up to the most
—or nearly the most —heavily mortgaged
country on earth to begin to do a bit for
posterity. When it came to a, vote, Petrie
could get only eight others to join their Ayes
to his. r
“Kobbi”: Notwithstanding Digby Den-
ham’s poetical allusion to “clear skies,” and
the sundry whoops about prosperity, Bana-
naland fears that it is up against a dry
time. Cairns (N.Q.), where it is alleged
youngsters are born with overcoats on, has
had to date 156.84 inches this year. But
only about a quarter inch fell in August,
and none, so far, (14/9/T1) in September.
The northern line, right even to Cloneurry,
shows the land on the fidget for dampness,
while cattle are already being hurried by
train to relief country. The west and south
west have been paragraphed frequently of
late re dry stretches. In Central Queens-
land, the householder, in between his jour-
neys to the nearest well, has for months been
observing the weather with the persistency
of Clement Wragge. Mount Morgan’s dams
are showing a big stretch of bank. And
Yeppoon (C.Q.), usually a very wet corner,
hasn't put up an umbrella for several
months, except when it put the thing up the
spout as superannuated goods.

The Wine of the Barley.
FOR countless generations Ale has been a favorite beverage.
It was drunk in Egypt 3000 years before the Christian
era; it was known and appreciated by the ancient Gauls;
it was the favorite liquor of the Anglo-Saxons and Danes, and
is still the premier drink of the most alert and active peoples of
the world. It was the drink of the lusty and strong, the
“doers” in the history of the past.
Cascade Ale, brewed by the Cascade Brewery Co., of Hcbart,
is akin to the ale of old England, for it is rich in the qualities that
promote health and strength. That its merits are appreciated by
those most competent to judge is proved by the rapidly-growing
sales in every part of the Commonwealth.

LIVING ON KOOMAH SPA.
Fasting to secure good health is the newest
and most successful way of making sick
people well. Many remarkable health recov-
eries have been brought about by this new
system of treatment. In cases where pure
natural water is given to patients, the fast-
ing cure has been particularly successful.
Get the habit of drinking KOOMAH SPA
(from the Rock Flat Springs, Cooma,
N.S.W.) every day. It will purify the
blood and aid the digestion to such an extent
that fasting will be unnecessary.

On the addition of water as directed, it forms an accurately estimated
humanised milk, and may be given alternately with the natural food
without fear of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance.
Weaning can therefore proceed gradually with comfort both to mother
and child. Farinaceous foods should not be given at this time.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and .comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it. lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
fV
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bough't you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. We do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

“Fontaine”: Mostly the Australian youth
takes kindly to compulsory service; but one
of him, at least, has his own views on the
matter. A Melbourne area officer recently
got this note from one of his squad: “Dear
Sir, I beg to resign from the compulsory
military training.” The epistle, framed, now
adorns the walls of the orderly room.

THE Edison Phonograph has just the
right volume of sound for the home —
your home. It is not brassy, strident
or bold, not loud enough to be heard in
a concert-hall or the house across the
street. When you go to hear the Edison
demonstrated, remember it will not echo
from one end of the shop to the other
as some instruments do. The Edison
reproduces sound —not noise.
There is an Edison Phonograph for you
at anv price from £2 12s. 6d. to £45.
Hear it to-day at the dealer’s nearest

Extract of a letter from
the late Manager, “ Motor
Transit Company of Aus-
tralia,” Glen Inpes: “During
the time I was managing
‘The Motor Transit Co. of
Australia,’ we had plying
between Glen Innes and Inverell an 11-16 Clement-Bayard Oar, whicn we purchased as second-hand. We
did about 60,000 miles with her up to the time of my leaving (she is still going well). Nearly all the running
was done between Glen Innes and Inverell, over the famous Waterloo Range, some of the grades of which
are one in six. The Car was invariably overloaded, and was given very little care ; but in the face of the bad
usage she received at our hands she stood up wonderfully well, and the only repairs that were effected were
two ball races lor road wheels and a set of new valves.”
Call and allow us to explain the reason why our prices for Cars generally, Commercial Lorries and High-
wheel Buggies will be found to be 25 per cent, lower than the usual Sydney quotations.

Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its splendid
healing power. Sufferers from Bronchitis, Cough, Croup, Asthma,
Hoarseness, Difficulty of Breathing, Pain or Soreness in the client,
experience delightful and rapid relief, and to those who are subject
to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure.
It is most comforting in allaying Irritation in the Throat and giving
Strength to the Voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to
become chronic nor Consumption to develop. Consumption is not
known where ‘‘Coughs” have, on their first appearance, been
properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without
it, as taken at the beginning, a dose or two is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.

A CIGAR is the BEST
SMOKE OF ALL!
But why can’t you get a
Good Cigar in the Country?
ALL over Australasia the only places you can
buy a really high-class Cigar is in the big
cities, In the country districts a good Cigar
cannot be had; because it’s only at the pubs that
you can buy Cigars at all in the out-back districts.
The publican knows that selling liquor pays him
better. He reckons that his customers only call
for a Cigar when they ve got a few drinks in and
want to dodge getting “fu’ the noo." Any old
Cigar does for that.
So he buys a few hundred at a time from
some “back-yarder"—real “Flor de Cabbage”
with big gold pictures all over the box and
mighty pretty bands round them—made from the
waste leaf and the cheapest growths, but called
by some high-falutin' name. (The making of these
Cigars is another story —I’ll tell you about it
another time.)
sdfdfdsfsf
Tbestorekeeperor tobac-
conist in country towns does
not sell good Cigars either.
If he does, he has to add to
the selling price of the Cigar,
the maker’s profit, the profit
of the warehouseman he
buys from, the profit of the
traveller who calls and sells
them to him, and his own
profit.
So that a good Cigar
that sells in the city at 6d.
he’d have to charge gd. for,
and not grow fat on it then,
because the number he would
sell would be small; and
good Cigars have to be kept
in a uniform temperature,
free from exposure to the
air, or else they’ll go off.
Those are just some of
the reasons why you can't
get a good Cigar in the
country parts of Australia,
and also why so very few
Cigars are at present smoked
in the country.
Buy a 100-box of my
" DIADEMAS,” smoke 5 or
6 of them, and, if they’re
not as good as any 6d.
Cigar you’veever smoked,
you needn’t pay a penny.
That's the way I’m in-
troducing my Cigars into
Australia. I know Cigar-
making from A to 7.. I know
these DIADEMAS Cigars of
mine are just the coolest,
smoothest and most luxu-
rious smoke any man could wish for. Cigar-
smokers of a lifetime say so; and the more you
know about a good Cigar the better you’ll like
them.
My DIADEMAS are made from the very
finest, mild, rich, mellow, J ava leaf, the filling or
inside heart of the Cigar being all straight long
Brazilian. The Cigars are hand made by skilled
workers, and every box has to pass me before it
goes out to a customer; and is guaranteed to
burn free and draw easily. The Cigar is 4 inches
long, and the picture at the side is a copy of it,
exact in size and shape.
Now, this DIADEMAS Cigar is as good as
any 6d. Cigar, sold in the cities by high-class
tobacconists, as I sell it direct to the customer —
saving the cost of wholesalers’, salesmen’s, and
retailers’ profit. I only charge you 22/6 the box
of too DIADEMAS, postage paid right to your
address.
Send 22/6 to-day, and get the box of too
DIADEMAS by return post. In ordering, say
whether you like the mild, medium, or strong
grade. Please add exchange to country and
interstate cheques.

“No medicine brings me such good health as Laxo-Tonic Tills. I used to read in the
papers about other medicines and what great good they would do you, but when I
bought them they always proved a disap-
pointment. I found that Laxo-Tonic Pills
both keep the Liver, Bowels and Stomach in
good order, and tone up the system and
string you together, as it were, as well,”
writes Mrs. Bennett, 2 Little Napier-street,
Paddington, N.S.W. “I first, became
acquainted with Laxo-Tonic Pills in
this way: I bought a box of the Pills
to enter one of the Limerick Compe-
titions. I had no use for the Pills at
the time, so I put them away. A
little while after I fell ill. My whole
system was out of order. 1 had pains
in the head and back. My appetite
went away and I slept very badly. I
felt dead tired and limp from the time
I got up in the morning till I went to
bed at night. I was nervous, worried
and depressed. I tried two or three
tonics, but they didn’t act. Then I
thought of the Laxo-Tonic Pills that
were lying idle in the house. I just
took some at night on the off chance,
as it were. Next morning I felt
greatly improved, so I continued the
Pills. Before the week was out ail
my troubles were gone, and I fel»
bright and lively and in perfect health. I have recommended the Pills to other
people, and they have done good in the same surprising way.”

The Man of Little Faith.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WILLIE Torrence, the young accred-
ited clerk of Schinken and Over-
end, stockbrokers, of Draper’s
Gardens, London, stood in Throgmorton-
street, gazing for a moment after the re-
treating figure of Robert Laidley, of Paisley
—a man whose name was one of the strong-
est in the North.
“Queer mixture of business and religion
that,” said Torrence to himself, and, having
said it, immediately lost all interest in the
queer mixture, and became Schinken and
Overend’s clever, intuitive “half-book man”
again. Behind that frank countenance, lit
by very blue eyes that looked honesty, was
hidden an ambitious, supple mind. Out-
wardly, he was as frank as a schoolboy who
loved sport more than work; inwardly, his
environment had sharpened while it tainted
him. At the early age of 25 he shared big
commissions with his principals; his native
integrity, unconsciously to himself, warped
to regard all things—mines, railroads, bonds
and industries —as having but one utility,
that of the gambling counter.
The lust of the game had eaten to his
marrow, but behind the sporting instinct, and
soiling it, was the lust for quick riches. His
dreams were all of money easy gotten; on
the ’bus from Kensington in the morning;
iu the Tube at night; in his bath, and at his
meals, he day-dreamed of millions, won by a
turn of the market —the joy of a safe bear
in a stock that would sink a quarter a day,
from the moment he had sold and never call
for the payment of a difference ; the rapture
of holding all the shares in a 200,000 share
comnany, knowing that some mad millionaire
had beared 250,000 of them. Imagination
governed his arithmetic. To sell something
he had not overnight, and to wake next
morning and find he had netted £50,000; to
buy something he did not want, and imme-
diately after the purchase to find the whole
world clamoring tor it.
The dreams did not obsess him; they
made him the hungrier for sport, and the
keener when at work. He lost no oppor-
tunity. Schinken and Overend were well
pleased with him. His winnings mounted
steadily; he rarely made a mistake. For a
time he was satisfied ; then the gradual pro-
gression wearied him; tired of crawling, he
wanted to fly.
And one day came the opportunity, and
he called on Schinken and Overend for the
wings.
His information came from a reliable
quarter. Henry Nairn, a mining engineer,
who only considered the value of a mine in
appraising the value of its shares, was a fit
adviser for Torrence, who only considered
the market in appraising the value of any-
thing. Nairn and Torrence seemed a perfect
combination —the man of facts, and the man
of the market—w r hich is often utterly op-
posed to facts.
Nairn’s training and experience had made
first a scoffer and then a pessimist of him ;
he the consideration of the Swift
Snail Gold Mines with a joy that was almost
malevolent. “It’s a dead sure bear, Willie,"
he said. “I won’t put up a penny, or take
any liability, but I’m to have 15 per cent, of
the profits for my information and advice.
Is that a deal?”
“It is,” replied Torrence, his fair face
flushing with excitement, and they shook
hands.
“The mine is the Swift Snail,” said Nairn.
Torrence was frankly disappointed, and
looked it.
“Impossible,” he said. “Why, look at
raeir returns for the last year—every
numth going better. And the stocks at
laj.”
, ‘All very fine and large,” replied Nairn,
iheir crushings have been good, but they’ve
Picked out the eyes of the mine to do it.
And”—he looked around him, fearful of
being overheard, although they were alone
111 ( the little tea-room near Warnford Court
their developments are bad. Man—the
lower levels are not worth four penny-
weights.”
“But, Swift Snails,” again protested Tor-
rence, in a louder voice
“Ss-sh—Call ’em Crocodiles in future —
you never know who’s listening.” He
glanced suspiciously at the little brown lady,
who owned the tea-room, saw that she was
busy drawing threads from a tea-cloth, and
was evidently reassured by the sight.
“But,” said Torrence, in a voice full of
awe,, Huffman and Spink are behind it.
They re a terrible crowd to bump up
against.”

kw—Crocodiles, I mean—(and don’t say H.
and S.’s name any more —don’t think it

months are out.”
‘‘But the reports were good, Nairn.”
.Book here, Willie, you know me. I know
the mine. I’ve been below, and I have a
man in the mine now. I tell you we’ve got
a , i.rtune in sight. Will you take it on, or
shall I find another man?”
« The decided belief of fortune in sight had
hred Torrence’s blood; the thought that
another man might dare more than he, and
Wl J} ove f his head, decided him.

Uverend won’t join you?”
T’B do jt myself,” replied Terrence, full
ot fight and enthusiasm.
Bood man! Then it’s sure.”
There 11 be big differences to pay for a
time.
Don t you believe it. Sell ’em till the cows
come home. Make the bear determined
enough, and theydl come down with a run.”

Mr. Schinken waggled his ear again, and
Mr. Overgnd repeated his imitation of an
ascending and descending corkscrew.
“Have you any objection to my bearing it

Mr. Schinken replied indulgently: “Not

“a bear of fifty or a hundred!” said Tor-
rence to himself as he left them. “Fifty
thousand more likely. I’m a big bear, or
none at all. Stock stands at 15|, and is
worth probably I\. I’m in it. I see half a
million for Willie in this account.”
If be had any lingering fears that night,
they were dissipated by Nairn and pleasant
circumstances. Dinner at the Cafe Royal,
Melba in “Romeo et Juliette,” and supper
at the Carlton, made the outlook brilliant—
full of light, music, endless money, and om-
nipotent, omniscient youthfulness that should
never die.
* * * *
He opened his bear account with a Napo-
leonically-decisive daring, selling Swift
Snails by the hundred and the thousand. The
market absorbed the first three days’ sales,
and the price moved downward only a point
or two. Then a few small holders took
fright at this attack on their property—an
attack that had opened with the calm
audacity that knows it is preparing for a
long fight, but knows, also'', that it will win.
The small holders threw their shares in as
sellers. A few little bears —small, imitative
animals, who never have information or in-
itiative of their own, and do the thing they
see done by other and more important ani-
mals in the city menagerie—sold by the
fifty and the hundred ; saw the genuine sales
and the bogus sales absorbed and the market
rising; squealed, and bought in to cover
their sales—escaping with a loss of half a
crown a share. Torrence continued selling
until he had sold 15,000, and the market
rose a half. He gritted his teeth to the emer-
gency, and sold another 5000, and they were
taken before his offers were well out’of his
mouth. The stock rose against him by leaps
and bounds. He made his information pub-
lic, and the financial papers printed columns
of comments on the well-hidden truth of the
Swift Snail mines. The telegraphs began
their work, and 10,000 miles of cable pulsed
assertion and denial, making statements of
the utter worthlessness of the ore in the
lower levels of the Swift Snail, and .immedi-
ately contradicting them with reassuring re-
ports from the naturally impartial manager
of the mine. The balance of credibility was
with Torrence—yet the stock steadily rose.
Then the public lost interest, and the little
imitative bears withdrew from the arena, for
everybody knew that Huffman and Spink
were strong bulls. The bull and the bear
were left to fight it out. Everybody knew
that Torrence had gone too far to retreat,
and as every holder except Huffman and
Spink was now a seller, and the stock con-
tinued rising, and Torrence continued sell-
ing, it was patent that Huffman and Spink
had burned their boats also. A duel to the
death.
On the first account, Torrence’s liabilitv
for differences was roughly £25.000. He sold
an interest in the bear, but without liability,
for an advance against all other stocks he
held ; he mortgaged himself and future pro-
fits to Schinken and Overend; he overdrew
his bank account to a special limit; he per-
suaded his brother to mortgage his property
and his future, and he found the money.
The stock came back a little, and he
thought the tide had turned, and recom-
menced selling. But it was only Huffman
and Spink’s bluff to try his strength. He
sold another 5000 shares, and they put the
price higher than it had ever been.
“Hood Lord!” said Torrence to himself;
“only 10 days to the settlement, and they’ve
put the price up to over 17. At this rate I
have lost everything, and I'm mortgaged
ahead for £30,000. But I’m damned if I’ll
be beaten.”
Settlement day was very near —where was
he to find the difference?
The next mail answered him. It was a
letter from a friend and client —one Lane —
a registered letter and a key.
Dear Torrence, —I send you the key of my safe
deposit box. I am coming to London in a fortnight
or so. Will you please sell all the Grand Trunks,
Eries and Lackawannas at best. I’ve got a new
business offered me, that will mop up all of
£30,000. As you sell, take the stock from the safe
deposit, and pay your firm’s cheque into my account
with Smith’s.
New hope and sure fortune! Lane would
not want the money till he arrived. He need
not know when the stock was sold as long as
the money was ready when he wanted it. It
would be a little irregular, of course, to make
a temporary use of another man’s money,
but nobody would ever know, and it would
save him.
So at the next settlement Torrence paid
his differences, to the utter amazement of
Huffman and Spink.
“Tell you what, Jim.” said Spink ; “it’s no
use of Schinken and Overend saying they're
not in this. I expected Torrence to squeal
to-day, and instead, he pays up like the Bank
of England. They're behind him all right.”
Torrence's principals had alluded anxi-
ously to his Hreat Bear, and Torrence had
satisfied all parties by allowing them to
think that there was a great financial power
now standing behind him and supplying him
with unlimited money.
The mine, in the eyes of the public, was
now almost certainly a coming failure, but
the public was afraid of Huffman and Spink,
and held aloof from the struggle, and the im-
possible happened. No holder came forward
to relieve the market even at these artificial
high prices. But Torrence continued a sel-
ler, growing daily more anxious, but as full
of courage as at the beginning—nay, fuller,
because as the game became more desperate
he became cooler, knowing that if the worst
should come, it would not decrease his cour-
age, for then would come despair, and de-
spair fears nothing.
Five days before the third settlement Huff-
man and Spink became very bitter, and put
up the price to 25. They threatened to ruin
Schinken and Overend, and were much
amazed and secretly disquieted to observe
the child-like innocence of those two gentle-
men. The artless way Schinken waggled his
ear, and the maidenly simper of Mr. Over-
end as he described ascending and descending
spirals with his forefinger so oppressed them
that they snarled like cornered rats, and put
the price to 26.
At that figure Torrence sold them the last
thousand of the 45,000 that represented his
Bear. It was truly a colossal animal—it
sat upon his chest during nights of alternate
insomnia and nightmare, and in the daytime j

Pimples, Spots, Boils, Rashes, Eruptions,
and all Spring Skin-Troubles Banished.
WITH the approach of Spring do you find little
rough patches on your forehead, or cheek,
or chin ? Has your skin a curious “ tight"
feeling ? Are your hands or finger-ends sore?
Is your skin, because of its burden of impurity,
disfigured by nasty pimples, boils, abscesses, or
eruptions ? Have you a raw, tender feeling
where your skin creases—or are you very liable
to chafing about the neck ?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the
first signs of an unhealthy skin, should never
be neglected. Following in their train are all
the tortures of fiery eczema, wide-reaching
blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should treat
this skin disease. It is not the slightest use relying upon
any internal remedy or external application if these do not
reach the impurity itself, which is the cause of the disorga-
nisation in our delicate and intricate tissues. Cheap and
coarse ointments and so-called blood-mixtures may make
eczema “ slumber ” awhile, but the disease soon breaks forth
in all its “ fire ” and itching irritation, for the root-evil has
not been touched.
Zam-Buk, because of its absolute purity, is theideal Spring
skin-balm. Zam-Buk is so refined that the tissues absorb it
readily ; and its medicinal essences at once attack the disease
below the surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by
accident or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth of
new and healthy tissues in a quick and marvellous manner.
ILVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUH
COVERED WITH ITCHING RASH.
Mrs. J. A. Richardson, of First Avenue, St
Peters, Adelaide, says:—“A rash broke out all
over me, and lumps came out which were very
irritable. I could pet very little rest, but on
using Zam-Buk I was very quickly eased of all
irritability, and in a short time by keeping Zam-
Buk well applied had the pleasure of seeing new
skin forming. Zam-Buk completely cured me.”
PAINFUL BOILS BANISHED.
Mr. H. Christie, of 10 London Street, Enmore,
Sydney, says :—I was troubled with boils, and
tried all ; manner of things to get rid of > hem.
but to no avail. Seeing Zam-Buk advertised as
a cure, I procured a pot, and app'ied it as
directed, with the pleasing result mat the boils
had entirely disappeared after three days’
treatment.”

it trotted beside him in Throgmorton-street,
and told him that by next settling day the
price of its maintenance would be £322,000.
Then a letter came from Lane asking for
sale notes, a-nd wondering why nothing had
been paid to his account, and that completed
the decay of Torrence’s youth. The misap-
propriation of Lane’s money put him outside
the pale of sympathy; he could open his
heart to none. The debt to his brother sun-
dered them; his use of Lane’s money kept
him from confiding in his mother. Nairn
was of no use in this strait. He had speci-
fically freed himself from liability in the
beginning, and even if he had not, he had no
money.
The life had gone out of Torrence—he was
horribly afraid. The marvellously youthful
color had left his face; even the youthful
contour had disappeared, making him grey,
old, haggard and wan. The long-drawn ten-
sion or the last 40 days had burred his
nerves; the anxiety and the fear of the week
to come obsessed him, so that the cant name
of the speculative seller, selling that which he
has not got, seemed to materialise itself. He
thought he heard the soft, cushiony foot-
falls of a great plantigrade on the pavement
beside him—the unmistakable sound of flesh
and fur on stone; he seemed to feel a cold
muzzle thrust into his hand, and a great,
red, lolling tongue licking his fingers.
“My God!” said Torrence. “This won’t
do. I’m going mad !”
He sought the little tea-room in Warn-
ford Court; ordered some tea, and while it
was preparing took up a paper and read it
listlessly. And the first thing his eye
chanced on was a police-court report headed
“A Bear in the Dock.” The connection made
him start, violently, lie read it again, and
saw that it was the report of a prosecution
of two Frenchmen who had blocked traffic
with a performing bear.
He threw down the paper impatiently, and
drank his- tea, and the man opposite him put
down his paper also, and said: “Mr. To-
rence!”
“How are you, Mr. Laidley?' asked Tor-.
rence, glad of any company, even of the com-
pany of the man of Paisley.
“I’m weel—but ye’re no lookin’ weel yer-
sel’ ?”
"I’m all right, but —you know—a big deal
always brings anxiety.”
“It is na gude—laddie, it is na gude,” said
Laklley, regarding him benevolently, or in-
quisitively—Torrence was not sure which.
“Will ye win througn wi’ it, laddie?”
asked Laidley, as if he were merely kindly
curious.
Glad of the relief of even a partial dis-
closure, Torrence answered almost eagerly:
“I think so —i in almost sure so. The
mine is in itself worthless —the shares are
not worth a pound.”
“But —laddie —they’re no’ ane ; they’re
nigher 30.”
“But they must come down with a run,
Mr. Laidley.”
“Aye! Aye! but will they fa’ doon in
time for ye?”
Torrence was silent—heart-sick with ap-
prehension.
“Laddie! They willna’ fa’ till ye ’re
broken. I ken Guffman an’ Spink.”
“Then I’m ruined.”
“What will save ye?”
The note of kindliness in his voice roused
Torrence to a new hope. He leaned over the
table, and said in a low voice, raspy with
emotion: —
“Oh ! Mr. Laidley—if you could help me.
Come in on the bear, and help me through
this account, and we’ll smash Guffman and
Spink.”
“What share would ye gie me?”
“A half —if that isn't enough—three-
quarters. There’s a million profit in it, if
we could hold, out to the end.”
“Laddie ! -Laddie ! ’Tis no' the business for
me. How much would clear ye?”
“Three hundred and twenty-two thousand
pounds.”
“O-o-o-o-o-h —e-e-e-e-e-e-e, man ! Dinna
speaii o’ so much at once. ’Tis disrespeckfu’
to money. A canna’ help ye, laddie.”
“Mr. Laidley, you can if you want to.
You'll not say you couldn’t get the money
on guarantee if the business was good.”
“Na—na—l willna’ say that. But the
business is na gude for me. So ye hae no
chance?”
“None! If the market doesn’t break in
three days—break to nothing—l’m broken.”
Laidley leaned across the table in his turn
and whispered: “Laddie, ha’ ye prayed?”
“Prayed !”
“Yes —prayed that the market may
break.’
Torrence laughed bitterly. “Is that your
.help? Prayed! Prayed for the market to
break. No! I’ve no time for that foolish-
ness.”
“Dinna’ ca’ it fulishness, laddie —I hae
prov’t it. Years syne I was a bull o’ Kelvin
Joint Stock Banks preferred. I bought four
thoosan’ o’ them at 19 —forbye I didna’
know that the bank had been caught heavy
in advances .to refinerries just before the
sugar smash. When I knew, the stock had
fa’en to saxteen, laddie—’twas a loss
o’ twal’ thoosan’ poonds. Laddie —I’m no
bearr. There are borrn bulls and borrn
bearrs. An’ I’m a borrn bull —an’ so are
you—laddie, I ken ye’re a borrn bull by ye’r
een. An’ ’tisna natural for a borrn bull to
be a bearr —Nature willna’ hae it. That’s
why the market for Swift Snails is ower 27.
.... Weel! I’m no’ a bearr; I canna’ bring
mysel’ to cut a loss. So I began to pray,
laddie —an’ the stock dropped to 15 —saxteen
thoosan’ poonds o’ a loss t’ me. I couldna’
cut the loss. then. I prayed, an’ I prayed—
man, I prayed powerfu’, an’ I sweated whiles
I prayed; an’ the stock lifted to 18, an’ then
dropped to 17i ; an’ I prayed it back again.
I went doon on my knees an’ wrestled wi’
the Spirit; an’ after three weeks of hearrt-
rendin’ prayer—prayer wi’oot ceasin’, laddie,
I liftit the stock to 18 an’ a hauf, an’ sold on
the turn o’ the marrket.”
“Was anybody praying against you?”
asked Torrence, his despair making him
ribald.
“Laddie —laddie—dinna’ jest wi’ sacred
things. An’ as soon as 1 sold oot an’ stoppit
prayin’, the stock cam’ doon to saxteen, an’
it hasna’ moved up since. Laddie! I canna’
help ye—but ye may help yersel’. Pray,
laddie—pray wi’oot ceasin’.”
“I’m no hand at praying, Mr. Laidley—
but if you will pray Swift Snails down to
10. I’ll give you £100,000.”
The Scotchman rose in offended dignity.
“Ye maun hae yer jest, laddie —Ah ! if ye
wull, ye’ll pay the price, o’t. ... I canna’ pray
for ye —I maun pray for my own stock.”
He held out his hand, and Torrence
clasped and held it, and the horror of his
position came to him.
“Mr. Laidley, you can help me. For Gods
sake, do help me. If I can’t pull through
this, I’m worse than ruined.”
“Worse than ruined, laddie?”
“Yes.”
Laidley came nearer, and loooked sternly
into the younger man’s eyes. '
“Ye hae dippit yer haun’ intil amther;
man's cash-box?” . ,
“Yes. For God’s sake, help me —it s quite
safe, and you’ll be half a million ahead on
the deal. Don’t say no, Mr. Laidley. lor
God’s sake —for m.y mother’s sake”— —
“Dinna’ greet aboot yer mither! Why
didna’ ye think before o’ her?” He wrenched
his coat from the despairing grasp ot the
younger man, who had caught at the lapel.
“I hae no maircy on the thief.' He
glared his hatred of all financial irregu-
larity. “Ye are na’ fit to pray.’
He walked away, his boots squeaking rec-
titude, and every wiry hair of his white,
correct Pharisaical beard bristling with in-
dignation. The door slammed behind him.
Torrence hid his face in his hands, and the
little brown woman found him so in the now
darkening tea-room, as she came to tell him
that her business hours were over and closing-
time come.
He roused himself with an effort and
took his hat; but as he walked to the door
after paying, the little brown woman said :
“It will be eighteenpence, please. The other
gentleman did not pay.”
Torrence smiled bitterly—the Pharisee
had saved ninepence by his indignation. The
ruined bear paid, and walked into Throg-
morton-street. At the Tube station he bought
a last edition, and read that Swift Snails
had closed strong at 274 buyer, and at that
he smiled again, as if nothing could hurt
him more.
He was thankful for the absence of his
mother in the country, and then surprised
that he could be thankful for anything.
There was everything in order in his own
special sitting-room in the luxurious flat. He
did not want any dinner, he explained to the
servant, who seemed surprised at his early
return, but he drank a bottle of champagne,
and felt his courage returning in response to
the genial influence of the wine.
He was almost cheerful as he opened his
letters. One of them was from Lane, de-
manding an immediate explanation; the
other a chatty letter from a cousin.
“May’s husband has sent such a queer pre-
sent from Australia. He says its proper
name is koala, but the people out there call
it the native bear. It’s such a queer-looking
thing—-it looked up at us with the wonder-
ing, steady look of a Child. We went to the
dock this afternoon and brought the bear
away.”
The bear in the dock again!
“Good Lord! I’m getting childish,” he
said aloud. lie lit a cigar and tried to
smoke, but his hand trembled ; tne power to
perform the usually simple act of pulling the
cigar had departed from him, and the cigar
went out.
He lit another match, and held it until it
burned his fingers. , Then he dropped it, but
without hurry or pain, and stared at the un-
lighted asbestos stove as if hynnotised. Hope
had absolutely gone. He preferred to have
it so ; wilfully disregarding the chances that
certainly did exist, of a recovery and
triumph at the eleventh hour; glad in his
numbed condition and unnaturally swift
acceptation of defeat to think that there was
no chance of recovery—no loophole of es-
cape ; persuading nimself that by settling-
day Huffman and Spink would put the price
to 30 —35 —anything. And Lane was on his
way to London —not the boyishly-affectionate
Lane of old with his “How goes it, old
man?” and his cheery slapping of the shoul-
der ; but a grim, revengeful Lane, hungry
for his Fries and his Lackawannas, or the
£30,000 that represented them.
“The Bear in the Dock.”
The brilliant, electric light seemed dim-
mer ; the ebony elephants from Colombo that
ornamented a cabinet were not elephants,
but bears; the pattern of the carpet, the
figures on the walls changed to grizzlies
that shambled on their soft pads towards
him—their months open in humorously hun-
gry fashion. The great plantigrade whose
soft footfalls he had hi ard beside him in
Throgmorton-street. rolled against him—he
felt the rasp-rough tongue upon his down-
hanging hand.
“Damn Huffman and Spink and Nairn!
Damn Swift Snails and Schinken and Over-
end ! Damn Lane! Damn everything.”
The Pharisee of Paisley checked his stride
near Winchester House. His hatred of all
flagrant dishonesty—all financial irregu-
larity—was gradually replaced by the con-
centration of his business instincts on the
Swift Snail’s position.
He decided quickly, turned back to Cop-
thall Avenue, and stopped at the office of
Huffman and Spink. He smiled as he saw
that the place was still lighted—he knew
that to Vtuiiman and Spink the position was
too serious for them to be in a hurry to
leave.
Five minutes’ study of them convinced
him. He sought a broker —a man of un-
questionable solidity—and he sold a bear of
2000 shares at 274.
That night he prayed, but before sleep
came to him he had time to say to himself:
“Praying is verra sairveceable, but ’tis weel
to s >ii at the top o’ the market.”
Next day there was more reason for
prayer, for Huffman and Spink put the price
up to 29, and there were but two days to
the settling. So Laidley prayed.
Then genuine sellers came into the market
by scores, and Huffman and Spink bought
still. And the day after the market broke —
not by points, but ,with a run! Huffman
and Spink were ruined. At the last moment
the source of their advances had closed
them up. The whole world wanted to sell
Swift Snails. It nad a fierce joy in the
position; the weak never forget the strong
who have made them fear.
Laidley did not close his bear. account
until months later, and when he did he was
£45,000 richer.
But on the morning of the day Huffman
and Spink broke there was a wild man
named Lane heaping curses on the memory
of a suicide; and Willie Torrence lay back
in his arm-chair as if wearied —and in his
brain a bullet from a revolver fired nine
hours before the market fell away to the
weakness of water.
“The fool!” said Nairn. “If he had
waited till afternoon.”
“He jested at sacred things,” said Laidley,
as he read of the tragedy. “He liadna’
muckle faith.” ■ .. .
